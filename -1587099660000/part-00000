[[Josephus]] testifies to the presence of a Jewish population in the city. A decree of [[Roman Emperor]] [[Theodosius I]] from 379 regarding the persecution of Jews and destruction of [[synagogue]]s in [[Illyria]] and [[Thrace]] is also proof of early Jewish settlement in Bulgaria.\n\n==Bulgarian Empire==\nAfter the establishment of the [[First Bulgarian Empire]] and its recognition in 681, a number of Jews suffering persecution in the [[Byzantine Empire]] may have settled in Bulgaria. Jews also settled in [[Nikopol, Bulgaria|Nikopol]] in 967. Some arrived from the [[Republic of Ragusa]] and [[Italy]], when merchants from these lands were allowed to trade in the [[Second Bulgarian Empire]] by [[Ivan Asen II]]. Later, Tsar [[Ivan Alexander of Bulgaria|Ivan Alexander]] married a Jewish woman, [[Sarah (Theodora)|Sarah (renamed Theodora)]], who had converted to Christianity and had considerable influence in the court. She influenced her spouse to create the [[Tsardom of Vidin]] for her son [[Ivan Shishman]], who was also a Jew according to [[Halakha|Jewish law]], which determines religion [[Matrilineality in Judaism|according to the mother]]. Despite her Jewish past, she was fiercely pro-Church, which in those times was accompanied with anti-semitism. For example, in 1352, the church council ordered the expulsion of Jews Bulgaria for \"heretical activity\", (though this decree was not rigorously implemented).<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Zzci446GLakC&pg=PA28&dq=1352+bulgaria+jews&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjb-J30_qjRAhVCaRQKHdVVCqUQ6AEIGjAA#v=onepage&q=1352%20bulgaria%20jews&f=false|title=The Bulgarian Jews and the Final Solution, 1940\u20131944 |last=Chary |first=Frederick B. |date=1972-11-15 |publisher=University of Pittsburgh Press |year=|isbn=9780822976011|location=|pages=28|language=en|quote=|via=}}</ref> Physical attacks on Jews followed.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0xNYmFwyCdkC&pg=PA109&dq=1352+bulgaria+jews#v=onepage&q=1352%20bulgaria%20jews&f=false |title=At Europe's Borders: Medieval Towns in the Romanian Principalities |last=R\u0103dvan |first=Lauren\u021biu |date=2010-01-01 |publisher=Brill |year= |isbn=9004180109 |location= |pages=109 |language=en|quote=|via=}}</ref> In one case, three Jews who had been sentenced to death were killed by a mob despite the sentences having been repealed by the tsar.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.worldjewishcongress.org/en/about/communities/BG |title=World Jewish Congress|last=Congress|first=World Jewish|website=www.worldjewishcongress.org|language=EN|access-date=2017-01-04}}</ref>\n\nThe medieval Jewish population of Bulgaria was [[Romaniotes|Romaniote]] until the 14th to 15th centuries, when [[Ashkenazim]] from [[Hungary]] (1376) and other parts of Europe began to arrive.\n\n==Ottoman rule==\n{{See also|History of the Jews in Turkey}}\nBy the completion of the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] conquest of the Bulgarian Empire (1396), there were sizable Jewish communities in [[Vidin]], Nikopol, [[Silistra]], [[Pleven]], [[Sofia]], [[Yambol]], [[Plovdiv]] (Philippopolis) and [[Stara Zagora]].\n\nIn 1470, Ashkenazim banished from [[Bavaria]] arrived, and contemporary travellers remarked that [[Yiddish]] could often be heard in Sofia. An Ashkenazi prayer book was printed in [[Thessaloniki|Saloniki]] by the rabbi of Sofia in the middle of the 16th century. Beginning in 1494, [[Sephardim|Sephardic]] exiles from Spain migrated to Bulgaria via Salonika, [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]], Italy, Ragusa, and [[Bosnia (region)|Bosnia]]. They settled in pre-existing Jewish population-centres, which were also the major trade centres of Ottoman-ruled Bulgaria. At this point, Sofia was host to three separate Jewish communities: Romaniotes, Ashkenazim and Sephardim. This would continue until 1640, when a single rabbi was appointed for all three groups.\n\nIn the 17th century, the ideas of [[Sabbatai Zevi]] became popular in Bulgaria, and supporters of his movement, such as [[Nathan of Gaza]] and Samuel Primo, were active in Sofia. Jews continued to settle in various parts of the country (including in new trade centres such as [[Pazardzhik]]), and were able to expand their economic activities due to the privileges they were given and due to the banishment of many [[Republic of Ragusa|Ragusan]] merchants who had taken part in the [[Chiprovtsi Uprising]] of 1688.\n\n==Modern Bulgaria==\nA [[Liberation of Bulgaria|modern nation-state of Bulgaria]] was formed under the terms of the [[Treaty of Berlin (1878)|Treaty of Berlin]], which ended the [[Russo-Turkish War of 1877\u201378]]. Under the terms of that treaty, Bulgarian Jews of the new country were granted equal rights. In 1909, the massive and grand new [[Sofia Synagogue]] was consecrated in the presence of [[Tsar]] [[Ferdinand I of Bulgaria]] as well as ministers and other important guests, an important event for Bulgarian Jewry.<ref name=\"bh.org.il\">{{cite web |title=The Jewish Community of Sofia |url=https://dbs.bh.org.il/place/sofia |publisher=The Museum of the Jewish People at Beit Hatfutsot}}</ref> Jews were drafted into the [[Bulgarian army]] and fought in the [[Serbo-Bulgarian War]] (1885), in the [[Balkan Wars]] (1912-13), and in the [[First World War]]. 211 Jewish soldiers of the Bulgarian army were recorded as having died during World War I.{{r|stefanov2002}} The [[Treaty of Neuilly]] after [[World War I]] emphasized Jews' equality with other Bulgarian citizens.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} In 1936, the nationalist and anti-semitic organization [[Ratniks|Ratnik]] was established.\n\nIn the years preceding [[World War II]], the population growth rate of the Jewish community lagged behind that of other ethnic groups. In 1920, there were 16,000 Jews, amounting to 0.9% of Bulgarians. By 1934, although the size of the Jewish community had grown to 48,565, with more than half living in Sofia, that only amounted to 0.8% of the general population. [[Ladino language|Ladino]] was the dominant language in most communities, but the young often preferred speaking [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]].

Jews have had a continuous presence in historic [[Bulgarian lands across the Danube|Bulgarian lands]] since before the 2nd century CE, and have often played an important part in the [[history of Bulgaria]].\n\nToday, the majority of [[Bulgarian Jews in Israel|Bulgarian Jews live in Israel]], while modern-day Bulgaria continues to host a modest Jewish population.\n\n==Roman era==\nJews are believed to have settled in the region after the Roman conquest in 46 CE.{{when|date=October 2015}} Ruins of \"sumptuous\"{{r|stefanov2002}} second-century synagogues have been unearthed in [[Philippopolis (Thrace)|Philipopolis]]<ref name=Kesiakova/> (modern [[Plovdiv]]),  [[Nicopolis]] ([[Nikopol, Bulgaria|Nikopol]]), [[Oescus|Ulpia Oescus]]{{r|kochev}} ([[Gigen]], [[Pleven Province]]), and [[Stobi]]<ref name=kraabel/> (now in [[North Macedonia]]).{{r|stefanov2002}} The earliest written artifact attesting to the presence of a [[Jewish community]] in the Roman province of [[Moesia Inferior]] is a late 2nd-century CE [[Latin]] inscription found at Ulpia Oescus bearing a [[Menorah (Temple)|menorah]] and mentioning ''archisynagogos''. [[Josephus]] testifies to the presence of a Jewish population in the city. A decree of [[Roman Emperor]] [[Theodosius I]] from 379 regarding the persecution of Jews and destruction of [[synagogue]]s in [[Illyria]] and [[Thrace]] is also proof of early Jewish settlement in Bulgaria.\n\n==Bulgarian Empire==\nAfter the establishment of the [[First Bulgarian Empire]] and its recognition in 681, a number of Jews suffering persecution in the [[Byzantine Empire]] may have settled in Bulgaria. Jews also settled in [[Nikopol, Bulgaria|Nikopol]] in 967. Some arrived from the [[Republic of Ragusa]] and [[Italy]], when merchants from these lands were allowed to trade in the [[Second Bulgarian Empire]] by [[Ivan Asen II]]. Later, Tsar [[Ivan Alexander of Bulgaria|Ivan Alexander]] married a Jewish woman, [[Sarah (Theodora)|Sarah (renamed Theodora)]], who had converted to Christianity and had considerable influence in the court. She influenced her spouse to create the [[Tsardom of Vidin]] for her son [[Ivan Shishman]], who was also a Jew according to [[Halakha|Jewish law]], which determines religion [[Matrilineality in Judaism|according to the mother]]. Despite her Jewish past, she was fiercely pro-Church, which in those times was accompanied with anti-semitism. For example, in 1352, the church council ordered the expulsion of Jews Bulgaria for \"heretical activity\", (though this decree was not rigorously implemented).<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Zzci446GLakC&pg=PA28&dq=1352+bulgaria+jews&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjb-J30_qjRAhVCaRQKHdVVCqUQ6AEIGjAA#v=onepage&q=1352%20bulgaria%20jews&f=false|title=The Bulgarian Jews and the Final Solution, 1940\u20131944 |last=Chary |first=Frederick B. |date=1972-11-15 |publisher=University of Pittsburgh Press |year=|isbn=9780822976011|location=|pages=28|language=en|quote=|via=}}</ref> Physical attacks on Jews followed.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0xNYmFwyCdkC&pg=PA109&dq=1352+bulgaria+jews#v=onepage&q=1352%20bulgaria%20jews&f=false |title=At Europe's Borders: Medieval Towns in the Romanian Principalities |last=R\u0103dvan |first=Lauren\u021biu |date=2010-01-01 |publisher=Brill |year= |isbn=9004180109 |location= |pages=109 |language=en|quote=|via=}}</ref> In one case, three Jews who had been sentenced to death were killed by a mob despite the sentences having been repealed by the tsar.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.worldjewishcongress.org/en/about/communities/BG |title=World Jewish Congress|last=Congress|first=World Jewish|website=www.worldjewishcongress.org|language=EN|access-date=2017-01-04}}</ref>\n\nThe medieval Jewish population of Bulgaria was [[Romaniotes|Romaniote]] until the 14th to 15th centuries, when [[Ashkenazim]] from [[Hungary]] (1376) and other parts of Europe began to arrive.\n\n==Ottoman rule==\n{{See also|History of the Jews in Turkey}}\nBy the completion of the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] conquest of the Bulgarian Empire (1396), there were sizable Jewish communities in [[Vidin]], Nikopol, [[Silistra]], [[Pleven]], [[Sofia]], [[Yambol]], [[Plovdiv]] (Philippopolis) and [[Stara Zagora]].\n\nIn 1470, Ashkenazim banished from [[Bavaria]] arrived, and contemporary travellers remarked that [[Yiddish]] could often be heard in Sofia. An Ashkenazi prayer book was printed in [[Thessaloniki|Saloniki]] by the rabbi of Sofia in the middle of the 16th century. Beginning in 1494, [[Sephardim|Sephardic]] exiles from Spain migrated to Bulgaria via Salonika, [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]], Italy, Ragusa, and [[Bosnia (region)|Bosnia]]. They settled in pre-existing Jewish population-centres, which were also the major trade centres of Ottoman-ruled Bulgaria. At this point, Sofia was host to three separate Jewish communities: Romaniotes, Ashkenazim and Sephardim. This would continue until 1640, when a single rabbi was appointed for all three groups.\n\nIn the 17th century, the ideas of [[Sabbatai Zevi]] became popular in Bulgaria, and supporters of his movement, such as [[Nathan of Gaza]] and Samuel Primo, were active in Sofia. Jews continued to settle in various parts of the country (including in new trade centres such as [[Pazardzhik]]), and were able to expand their economic activities due to the privileges they were given and due to the banishment of many [[Republic of Ragusa|Ragusan]] merchants who had taken part in the [[Chiprovtsi Uprising]] of 1688.\n\n==Modern Bulgaria==\nA [[Liberation of Bulgaria|modern nation-state of Bulgaria]] was formed under the terms of the [[Treaty of Berlin (1878)|Treaty of Berlin]], which ended the [[Russo-Turkish War of 1877\u201378]]. Under the terms of that treaty, Bulgarian Jews of the new country were granted equal rights. In 1909, the massive and grand new [[Sofia Synagogue]] was consecrated in the presence of [[Tsar]] [[Ferdinand I of Bulgaria]] as well as ministers and other important guests, an important event for Bulgarian Jewry.<ref name=\"bh.org.il\">{{cite web |title=The Jewish Community of Sofia |url=https://dbs.bh.org.il/place/sofia |publisher=The Museum of the Jewish People at Beit Hatfutsot}}</ref> Jews were drafted into the [[Bulgarian army]] and fought in the [[Serbo-Bulgarian War]] (1885), in the [[Balkan Wars]] (1912-13), and in the [[First World War]]. 211 Jewish soldiers of the Bulgarian army were recorded as having died during World War I.{{r|stefanov2002}} The [[Treaty of Neuilly]] after [[World War I]] emphasized Jews' equality with other Bulgarian citizens.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} In 1936, the nationalist and anti-semitic organization [[Ratniks|Ratnik]] was established.\n\nIn the years preceding [[World War II]], the population growth rate of the Jewish community lagged behind that of other ethnic groups. In 1920, there were 16,000 Jews, amounting to 0.9% of Bulgarians. By 1934, although the size of the Jewish community had grown to 48,565, with more than half living in Sofia, that only amounted to 0.8% of the general population. [[Ladino language|Ladino]] was the dominant language in most communities, but the young often preferred speaking [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]].

On the eve of the planned deportations, the Bulgarian government made inquiries regarding the destination of the deportees and asked to be reimbursed for the costs of deportation. German representatives indicated that the deportees would be used as labour in agricultural and military projects.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}} As recorded in the [[German Archives]], Nazi Germany paid 7,144.317&nbsp;[[leva]] for the deportation of 3,545 adults and 592 children destined for the [[Treblinka extermination camp]].{{r|maconline}} 4,500 [[History of the Jews in the Republic of Macedonia|Jews]] from Greek [[Thrace and Eastern Macedonia]] were deported to occupied Poland, and 7,144 from [[Vardar Macedonia]] and [[Pomoravlje District|Pomoravlje]] were sent to Treblinka.

News of the deportations in the occupied territories incited protest among opposition politicians, members of the clergy and intellectuals in Bulgaria. While [[Boris III of Bulgaria|Tsar Boris III]] was initially inclined to continue with the planned deportations, deputy speaker of parliament and prominent member of the ruling party [[Dimitar Peshev]] persuaded him to delay. On March 19, 1943, Peshev introduced a parliamentary resolution to halt the deportations; the resolution was rejected by the ruling party, which forced his resignation by the end of the month. Peshev's resignation was followed by further protests, notably from [[Stefan I of Bulgaria|Metropolitan Stefan I]], which persuaded the tsar to suspend the deportations indefinitely in May 1943. Shortly thereafter, the Bulgarian government expelled 20,000 Jews from Sofia to the provinces. Special trains were arranged and the Jews were assigned specific departures, separating family members.

Creation of acronyms such as this is rare in Singapore English, though ''TIBS'' ({{IPAc-en|\u02c8|t|\u026a|b|z}}, \"Trans-Island Bus Service\") and ''CISCO'' ({{IPAc-en|\u02c8|s|\u026a|s|k|o\u028a}}, \"Commercial and Industrial Security Corporation\") are found.<ref>Brown, ''Singapore English in a Nutshell'', above, p. 112.</ref>\n* [[Initialism]]s, in which the individual letters are spelled out. This is by far the most common category in Singapore, including ''PAP'' (\"[[People's Action Party]]\") and ''PIE'' (\"[[Pan-Island Expressway]]\"), which are pronounced {{IPAc-en|\u02cc|p|i\u02d0|_|\u02cc|e\u026a|_|\u02c8|p|i\u02d0}} and {{IPAc-en|\u02cc|p|i\u02d0|_|\u02cc|a\u026a|_|\u02c8|i\u02d0}} respectively and never {{IPA|*/\u02c8p\u00e6p/}} and {{IPA|*/\u02c8pa\u026a/}}. Some analysts regard initialisms such as these as one kind of acronym,<ref>Low & Brown, ''English in Singapore'', above, p. 70.</ref> but others prefer to distinguish between the two categories.<ref>Deterding, ''Singapore English'', above, p. 77.</ref>\n\nInitialisms are extremely common in Singapore, and many have become better known and more widely used than the full form of the words they represent. One example is the [[Kandang Kerbau Women's and Children's Hospital]], which is more commonly referred to as ''KK''.\n\nThe most important category of Singapore initialisms are those for government departments and public institutions. Among the earliest examples are ''PUB'' (\"Public Utilities Board\") and ''HDB'' (\"Housing Development Board\"). Abbreviations such as these were especially important in the past when most Singaporeans were not educated in English, and their use facilitated communication in the public services where the main administrative language is English. Government departments have therefore promoted the use of these initialisms, so they occur even in non-English publications. Although the younger generation of Singaporeans are now all educated in English, abbreviations remain a major characteristic of Singapore English.\n\nThere are efforts to maintain some consistency among the initialisms. Three letters are used for government institutions (''PUB'', ''HDB'', ''CPF'', ''MOH'', ''CWO'') and for expressways (''AYE'', ''PIE'', ''KJE''), while two letters are used for polytechnics (''SP'', ''RP''). To maintain this consistency, some abbreviations are not direct initials; for example ''CTE'' is used for \"Central Expressway\"  instead of *''CE'', and ''NP'' is used for \"Ngee Ann Polytechnic\" instead of *''NAP''. When the [[Nanyang Technological University]] (''NTU'') was established in 1991, the name was chosen instead of the alternative \"Nanyang University of Technology\" because the latter would have resulted in the unsuitable ''NUT''. While [[Anderson Secondary School]] has shortened its name to ''ANDSS'' instead of ''ASS''.\n\nRecently, there have emerged a number of unconventional abbreviations, such as ''A*STAR'' for ''Agency for Science, Technology and Research''.) When ''SAFTI'' (Singapore Armed Forces Training Institute) was reorganised in 1995, it acquired the name [[SAFTI Military Institute]], further abbreviated as ''SAFTI MI'', which when fully expanded would form a rather awkward title ''Singapore Armed Forces Training Institute Military Institute''.\n\n==Abbreviations==\n\n===0\u20139===\n*'''4D''' -

The most prominent are the three-letter abbreviations of the expressways in Singapore; all, except one, end with the letter \"E\":\n* '''AYE''' - [[Ayer Rajah Expressway]]\n* '''BKE''' - [[Bukit Timah Expressway]]\n* '''CTE''' - [[Central Expressway, Singapore|Central Expressway]]\n* '''ECP''' - [[East Coast Parkway]]\n* '''KJE''' - [[Kranji Expressway]]\n* '''KPE''' - [[Kallang-Paya Lebar Expressway]]\n* '''MCE''' - [[Marina Coastal Expressway]]\n* '''NSE''' - [[North\u2013South Expressway (Singapore)|North-South Expressway]]\n* '''PIE''' - [[Pan Island Expressway]]\n* '''SLE''' - [[Seletar Expressway]]\n* '''TPE''' - [[Tampines Expressway]]\n\nWith the introduction of the [[Expressway Monitoring and Advisory System]] (EMAS) in 1998, LED signboards were installed along the expressways to display warning and other informational messages to road users. This led to the increased use of abbreviations, some of which are less common and not easily understood. The following are examples of abbreviations used in the EMAS:<ref>{{Cite journal|title=EMAS \u2013 Your guide to a safer ride |url=http://www.aas.com.sg/features/archive/otr02012.htm |journal=The Highway |publisher=Automobile Association of Singapore |date=February 2001 |accessdate=2008-03-11 |format=\u2013 <sup>[https://scholar.google.co.uk/scholar?hl=en&lr=&q=intitle%3AEMAS+%26ndash%3B+Your+guide+to+a+safer+ride&as_publication=The+Highway&as_ylo=&as_yhi=&btnG=Search Scholar search]</sup> |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011095838/http://aas.com.sg/features/archive/otr02012.htm |archivedate=October 11, 2007 |url-status=dead }} .</ref>\n* '''NTH RD''' - North Road\n* '''STH RD''' - South Road\n* '''(CCK) DR''' - (Choa Chu Kang) Drive\n* '''TOWN HALL''' - Jurong Town Hall Road\n* '''(TP) AVE 10''' - (Tampines) Avenue 10\n* '''LT''' - left\n* '''RT''' - right\n* '''AFT''' - after\n* '''BEF''' - before\n* '''LN''' - lane\n* '''SH''' - shoulder\n\n==See also==\n* [[Singlish]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==References==\n<!--Please arrange alphabetically by author's surname, or if there is no author, by title.-->\n* {{cite book|last=Brown|first=Adam|title=Singapore English in a Nutshell: An Alphabetical Description of its Features|location=Singapore|publisher=Federal Publications|year=2000|isbn=981-01-2435-X}}\n* {{cite book|last=Deterding|first=David|title=Singapore English|location=Edinburgh|publisher=[[Edinburgh University Press]]|year=2007|isbn=0-7486-2545-3}}\n* {{cite book|last=Low|first=Ee Ling|author2=Adam Brown |title=English in Singapore: An Introduction|location=Singapore|publisher=McGraw-Hill Education (Asia)|year=2005|isbn=0-07-123975-8}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.talkingcock.com/html/lexec.php?op=LexPKL&lexicon=lexicon The Coxford Singlish Dictionary @ Talkingcock.com]\n* [http://www.singlishdictionary.com A Dictionary of Singlish and Singapore English]\n* [http://www.allacronyms.com/singapore/topic Singapore Acronyms and Abbreviations]\n\n[[Category:Lists of Singapore abbreviations| ]]\n[[Category:Singaporean culture|Abbreviations]]\n[[Category:Singlish|Abbreviations]]\n", "text_old": "This '''list of Singapore abbreviations''' sets out [[abbreviation]]s that are commonly used in [[Singapore]].\n\n{{Compact ToC\n|center=yes\n|align=center\n|num=yes\n|custom1=Overview\n|custom2=Abbreviations in the military\n|custom3=Abbreviations in transport\n|seealso=yes\n|notesfirst=yes\n|refs=yes\n|extlinks=yes\n}}\n\n==Overview==\n[[Abbreviation]]s are of three basic kinds:\n* [[Clipping (morphology)|Clippings]], in which a shortened form of a word occurs.

Creation of acronyms such as this is rare in Singapore English, though ''TIBS'' ({{IPAc-en|\u02c8|t|\u026a|b|z}}, \"Trans-Island Bus Service\") and ''CISCO'' ({{IPAc-en|\u02c8|s|\u026a|s|k|o\u028a}}, \"Commercial and Industrial Security Corporation\") are found.<ref>Brown, ''Singapore English in a Nutshell'', above, p. 112.</ref>\n* [[Initialism]]s, in which the individual letters are spelled out. This is by far the most common category in Singapore, including ''PAP'' (\"[[People's Action Party]]\") and ''PIE'' (\"[[Pan-Island Expressway]]\"), which are pronounced {{IPAc-en|\u02cc|p|i\u02d0|_|\u02cc|e\u026a|_|\u02c8|p|i\u02d0}} and {{IPAc-en|\u02cc|p|i\u02d0|_|\u02cc|a\u026a|_|\u02c8|i\u02d0}} respectively and never {{IPA|*/\u02c8p\u00e6p/}} and {{IPA|*/\u02c8pa\u026a/}}. Some analysts regard initialisms such as these as one kind of acronym,<ref>Low & Brown, ''English in Singapore'', above, p. 70.</ref> but others prefer to distinguish between the two categories.<ref>Deterding, ''Singapore English'', above, p. 77.</ref>\n\nInitialisms are extremely common in Singapore, and many have become better known and more widely used than the full form of the words they represent. One example is the [[Kandang Kerbau Women's and Children's Hospital]], which is more commonly referred to as ''KK''.\n\nThe most important category of Singapore initialisms are those for government departments and public institutions. Among the earliest examples are ''PUB'' (\"Public Utilities Board\") and ''HDB'' (\"Housing Development Board\"). Abbreviations such as these were especially important in the past when most Singaporeans were not educated in English, and their use facilitated communication in the public services where the main administrative language is English. Government departments have therefore promoted the use of these initialisms, so they occur even in non-English publications. Although the younger generation of Singaporeans are now all educated in English, abbreviations remain a major characteristic of Singapore English.\n\nThere are efforts to maintain some consistency among the initialisms. Three letters are used for government institutions (''PUB'', ''HDB'', ''CPF'', ''MOH'', ''CWO'') and for expressways (''AYE'', ''PIE'', ''KJE''), while two letters are used for polytechnics (''SP'', ''RP''). To maintain this consistency, some abbreviations are not direct initials; for example ''CTE'' is used for \"Central Expressway\"  instead of *''CE'', and ''NP'' is used for \"Ngee Ann Polytechnic\" instead of *''NAP''. When the [[Nanyang Technological University]] (''NTU'') was established in 1991, the name was chosen instead of the alternative \"Nanyang University of Technology\" because the latter would have resulted in the unsuitable ''NUT''. While [[Anderson Secondary School]] has shortened its name to ''ANDSS'' instead of ''ASS''.\n\nRecently, there have emerged a number of unconventional abbreviations, such as ''A*STAR'' for ''Agency for Science, Technology and Research''.) When ''SAFTI'' (Singapore Armed Forces Training Institute) was reorganised in 1995, it acquired the name [[SAFTI Military Institute]], further abbreviated as ''SAFTI MI'', which when fully expanded would form a rather awkward title ''Singapore Armed Forces Training Institute Military Institute''.\n\n==Abbreviations==\n\n===0\u20139===\n*'''4D''' -
