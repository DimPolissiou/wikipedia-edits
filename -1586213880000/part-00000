It was available to pre-order on October 27, 2017 and was released on November 3, 2017.\n\nThe iPhone X was intended to showcase what Apple considered the technology of the future. Using a glass and stainless-steel form factor and \"[[bezel (screen)|bezel-less]]\" design, shrinking the bezels, and not having a \"chin\", unlike many Android phones.  It was the first iPhone to use an [[OLED]] screen. The home button was replaced with a new type of authentication called [[Face ID]], which used sensors to [[Facial recognition system|scan the user's face]] to unlock the device. This face-recognition capability also enabled emojis to be animated following the user's expression (Animoji). With a bezel-less design, iPhone user interaction changed significantly, using gestures to navigate the operating system rather than the home button used in all previous iPhones. At the time of its November 2017 launch, its price tag of $999 USD also made it the most expensive iPhone ever, with even higher prices internationally due to additional local sales and import taxes.\n\nThe iPhone X received generally positive reviews. Its display and build quality were widely praised, and the camera also scored positively on tests. The phone received polarized reception due to the sensor housing \"[[notch (engineering)|notch]]\" at the top of the screen and the introduction of an all-new authentication method. The notch was heavily mocked by users on social media, although app developers responded either neutrally or positively to the changes it brought to the user experience in their apps and games. Reviewers had mixed reactions, with some condemning it and others acknowledging it as unusual in the first moments of use before getting accustomed to its presence. [[Face ID]] facial recognition was praised for its simple setup, but criticized for requiring direct eyes on the screen, though that option can be disabled within the [[system preferences]].\n\nAlong with the [[iPhone 6s]], its Plus variant, and the [[iPhone SE]], the iPhone X was discontinued on September 12, 2018 following the announcement of the new [[iPhone XS|iPhone XS, iPhone XS Max]] and [[iPhone XR]] devices. As a result, with a shelf life of just over 10 months, the iPhone X had the shortest ever tenure as the flagship device in the history of the iPhone.\n\nOn November 22, 2018, Apple reportedly resumed production of the iPhone X due to weak sales of its successors.

He criticized the repeated lack of a headphone jack, the device's fragility despite Apple's claims of durability, and the sensor notch, calling it \"ugly\". Patel highlighted the fact that apps required updates to fit the new screen, writing that not all popular apps had received updates by the time of the review, resulting in some apps with \"huge black borders\" resembling iPhone 8. He especially criticized the positioning of the sensor notch while holding the phone in landscape mode, causing the notch to go \"from being a somewhat forgettable element in the top status bar to a giant interruption on the side of the screen\". The cameras were given positive feedback for maintaining detail in low-light. Patel particularly praised Animoji, calling it \"probably the single best feature on the iPhone X\", writing that \"they just work, and they work incredibly well\". Finally, he wrote that Face ID was the whole foundation of iPhone X, and stated that it \"generally works great\", though acknowledging the occasional misstep, in which users must \"actively move the phone closer to your face to compensate\".

It was available to pre-order on October 27, 2017 and was released on November 3, 2017.\n\nThe iPhone X was intended to showcase what Apple considered the technology of the future. Using a glass and stainless-steel form factor and \"[[bezel (screen)|bezel-less]]\" design, shrinking the bezels, and not having a \"chin\", unlike many Android phones.  It was the first iPhone to use an [[OLED]] screen. The home button was replaced with a new type of authentication called [[Face ID]], which used sensors to [[Facial recognition system|scan the user's face]] to unlock the device. This face-recognition capability also enabled emojis to be animated following the user's expression (Animoji). With a bezel-less design, iPhone user interaction changed significantly, using gestures to navigate the operating system rather than the home button used in all previous iPhones. At the time of its November 2017 launch, its price tag of $999 USD also made it the most expensive iPhone ever, with even higher prices internationally due to additional local sales and import taxes.\n\nThe iPhone X received generally positive reviews. Its display and build quality were widely praised, and the camera also scored positively on tests. The phone received polarized reception due to the sensor housing \"[[notch (engineering)|notch]]\" at the top of the screen and the introduction of an all-new authentication method. The notch was heavily mocked by users on social media, although app developers responded either neutrally or positively to the changes it brought to the user experience in their apps and games. Reviewers had mixed reactions, with some condemning it and others acknowledging it as unusual in the first moments of use before getting accustomed to its presence. [[Face ID]] facial recognition was praised for its simple setup, but criticized for requiring direct eyes on the screen, though that option can be disabled within the [[system preferences]].\n\nAlong with the [[iPhone 6s]], its Plus variant, and the [[iPhone SE]], the iPhone X was discontinued on September 12, 2018 following the announcement of the new [[iPhone XS|iPhone XS, iPhone XS Max]] and [[iPhone XR]] devices. As a result, with a shelf life of just over 10 months, the iPhone X had the shortest ever tenure as the flagship device in the history of the iPhone.\n\nOn November 22, 2018, Apple reportedly resumed production of the iPhone X due to weak sales of its successors.

He criticized the repeated lack of a headphone jack, the device's fragility despite Apple's claims of durability, and the sensor notch, calling it \"ugly\". Patel highlighted the fact that apps required updates to fit the new screen, writing that not all popular apps had received updates by the time of the review, resulting in some apps with \"huge black borders\" resembling iPhone 8. He especially criticized the positioning of the sensor notch while holding the phone in landscape mode, causing the notch to go \"from being a somewhat forgettable element in the top status bar to a giant interruption on the side of the screen\". The cameras were given positive feedback for maintaining detail in low-light. Patel particularly praised Animoji, calling it \"probably the single best feature on the iPhone X\", writing that \"they just work, and they work incredibly well\".

During the time of the murders, he remained active in his community, regularly performing at events as his own characters, \"Pogo the [[Clown]]\" or \"Patches the Clown\", and so is known as the \"Killer Clown\". His first murder occurred in 1972 and at least 30 of his subsequent murders were committed after the divorce of his second wife in 1976. Investigation into the case of missing [[Des Plaines, Illinois|Des Plaines]] teenager Robert Piest led to Gacy's arrest on December 21, 1978.\n\nGacy was convicted of the [[sodomy]] of a teenage boy in Iowa in 1968. He was sentenced to 10 years' imprisonment, but was released from prison on good behavior; and returned to his home state of Illinois. It is believed all of his known murders were committed inside his [[Ranch-style house|ranch house]] in [[Norwood Park Township, Cook County, Illinois|Norwood Park]], a part of [[Chicago metropolitan area|metropolitan Chicago]]. Once lured to his home by force or deception, his victims were typically duped into donning [[handcuffs]] on the pretext of being shown a [[Magic (illusion)|magic trick]] and then raped and tortured before being murdered by either [[asphyxiation]] or [[strangulation]] with a makeshift [[garrote]].\n\n26 of Gacy's victims were buried in the [[Crawl space (basement)|crawl space]] of his home. Three other victims were buried elsewhere on his property, while the bodies of his last four known victims were discarded in the [[Des Plaines River]]. The conviction for 33 murders was then the largest number of murders charged to one individual in United States history. Gacy was sentenced to death on March 13, 1980 for 12 of those murders. He spent 14 years on death row at [[Menard Correctional Center]], spending much of his time painting, and was executed by [[lethal injection]] at [[Stateville Correctional Center]] on May 10, 1994.\n\n==Early life==\nJohn Wayne Gacy was born in Chicago, [[Illinois]] on March 17, 1942, the second child and only son of John Stanley Gacy (June 20, 1900 \u2013 December 25, 1969) and Marion Elaine Robinson (May 4, 1908 \u2013 December 6, 1989).<ref>''Serial Killers''. p. 63.</ref> His father was an auto repair machinist and [[World War I]] veteran,{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=24}} and his mother was a homemaker.<ref>Cook County marriage records provide his mother's name as Marion E.

On one occasion in 1957, the same friend witnessed an incident at the Gacy household in which Gacy's father began shouting at his son for no reason, then began hitting him.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=33}} Gacy's mother attempted to intervene. The friend recalled that Gacy simply \"put up his hands to defend himself\", adding that he never struck his father back during these physical altercations.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|pp=32\u201333}}\n\n===Career origins===\nIn 1960, at the age of 18, Gacy became involved in politics, working as an assistant [[precinct captain]] for a [[U.S. Democratic Party|Democratic Party]] candidate in his neighborhood. This decision earned more criticism from his father, who accused his son of being a \"[[wikt:Special:Search/dupe|patsy]]\". Gacy later speculated the decision may have been an attempt to seek the acceptance from others that he never received from his father.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=36}}\n\nThe same year Gacy became a Democratic candidate, his father bought him a car, with the title of the vehicle being in his father's name until Gacy had completed the monthly repayments.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=42}} These repayments took several years to complete, and his father would confiscate the keys to the vehicle if Gacy did not do as his father said. On one occasion in 1962, Gacy bought an extra set of keys after his father confiscated the original set. In response, his father removed the [[distributor cap]] from the vehicle, withholding the component for three days. \n\n==== Palm Mortuary, Las Vegas ====\nGacy recalled that as a result of this incident, he felt \"totally sick; drained\".{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=44}} When his father replaced the distributor cap, Gacy left the family home and drove to [[Las Vegas]], [[Nevada]], where he found work within the ambulance service before he was transferred to work as an attendant at Palm Mortuary. \n\nIn his role as a mortuary attendant, Gacy slept on a cot behind the [[embalming]] room.<ref>{{cite book|first=Tim|last=Cahill|url=https://books.google.com/?id=OF6itYw0HT0C&pg=PT30&lpg=PT30#v=onepage&q/ |title=Buried Dreams: Inside the Mind of a Serial Killer|publisher=[[Bantam Books]] |location=New York City|date=1986|access-date=March 14, 2013|isbn=978-0553051155}}</ref> He worked in this role for three months.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=258}} In this role, he observed morticians embalming dead bodies and later confessed that, on one evening while alone, he had clambered into the coffin of a deceased teenage male, embracing and caressing the body before experiencing a sense of shock.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=46}}{{efn|Gacy later claimed to have engaged in acts of [[necrophilia]] on approximately two occasions while he worked at Palm Mortuary. He justified his actions by claiming the bodies he had defiled were \"just dead things\" who \"couldn't tell anybody\".{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=346}}}} This prompted Gacy to call his mother the next day and ask whether his father would allow him to return home.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=46}} His father agreed and the same day, Gacy drove back to live with his family in Chicago.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=347}}\n\n==== Nunn-Bush Shoe Company ====\nUpon his return, despite the fact he had failed to graduate from high school, Gacy successfully enrolled in the [[Northwestern College (Illinois)|Northwestern Business College]],{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=47}} from which he graduated in 1963. Gacy subsequently took a management trainee position within the Nunn-Bush Shoe Company.{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|pp=18\u201319}} In 1964, the shoe company transferred Gacy to [[Springfield, Illinois|Springfield]] to work as a salesman.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=258}} He was eventually promoted to manager of his department. In March of that year, he became engaged to Marlynn Myers, a co-worker in the department he managed.{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|p=21}}\n\n==== Springfield Jaycees ====\nDuring his courtship with Marlynn, Gacy joined the local [[Jaycees]] and became a tireless worker for the organization, being named Key Man for the organization in April 1964.<ref>''Serial Killers''. p. 58.</ref> The same year, Gacy had his second homosexual experience. According to Gacy, he acquiesced to this incident after one of his colleagues in the Springfield Jaycees plied him with drinks and invited him to spend the evening upon his sofa; the colleague then performed [[oral sex]] upon him while he was drunk.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">{{cite journal |title=Murder In Mind |issue=11 |publisher=Marshall Cavendish Printworks|location=London, England|issn=1364-5803 |page=7}}</ref> By 1965, Gacy had risen to the position of vice-president of the Springfield Jaycees.{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|pp=20\u201322}} The same year, he was named as the third most outstanding Jaycee within the state of Illinois.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=48}}\n\n==Waterloo, Iowa==\nAfter a nine-month courtship, Gacy and Myers married in September 1964. Marlynn's father subsequently purchased three [[Kentucky Fried Chicken]] restaurants in [[Waterloo, Iowa|Waterloo]], [[Iowa]], and the couple moved to Waterloo so he could manage the restaurants, with the understanding that they would move into Marlynn's parents' home (which was vacated for the couple).{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|p=21}}{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|pp=261\u2013262}} The offer was lucrative: Gacy would receive $15,000 per year (the equivalent of $115,513 {{as of|2020|lc=y|df=US}}), plus a share of profits earned via the restaurants.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=50}} Following his obligatory completion of a managerial course, Gacy relocated to Waterloo with his wife later that year.{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|pp=23\u201325}}\n\n=== Waterloo Jaycees ===\nIn Waterloo, Gacy joined the local chapter of the Jaycees, regularly offering extended hours to the organization in addition to the 12- and 14-hour days he worked managing three restaurants. Although considered ambitious and something of a braggart by his colleagues in the Jaycees, he was highly regarded as a worker on several fund-raising projects. In 1967, he was named \"outstanding vice-president\" of the Waterloo Jaycees.{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|p=28}} At Jaycee meetings, Gacy often provided free fried chicken to his colleagues and insisted upon being given the nickname \"[[Colonel Sanders|Colonel]]\".{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=51}} The same year, Gacy served on the Board of Directors for the Waterloo Jaycees.{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|p=51}}\n\nGacy's wife gave birth to two children: a son was born in February 1966, followed by a daughter in March 1967. Gacy himself later described this period of his life as \"perfect\", adding that he finally earned the long-sought approval of his father. On one occasion in July 1966, Gacy's parents paid a visit to Iowa, during which his father apologized privately to him for the physical and emotional abuse he had inflicted on him throughout his childhood, before proudly informing him: \"Son, I was wrong about you.\"{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=53}}\n\nHowever, there was an unseemlier side of Jaycee life in Waterloo that involved [[wife swapping]],<ref name=\"ReferenceB\" /> [[prostitution]], [[pornography]], and drug use. Gacy was deeply involved in many of these activities and regularly cheated on his wife with local prostitutes.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=263}} Much of this  happened at the Clayton House Motel. He is also known to have opened a \"club\" in his basement, where he allowed his employees to drink alcohol and play pool. Although Gacy employed teenagers of both sexes at his restaurants, he socialized only with his young male employees. Many were given alcohol before Gacy made sexual advances toward them, which, if rebuffed, he would claim were jokes or a test of morals.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=265}}\n\n====Assault of Donald Voorhees====\nIn August 1967, Gacy committed his first known [[sexual assault]] upon a teenage boy. The victim was 15-year-old Donald Voorhees, the son of a fellow Jaycee. Gacy lured Voorhees to his house with the promise of showing him pornographic films.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=55}} Gacy plied Voorhees with alcohol and persuaded the youth to perform oral sex upon him. Over the following months, several other youths were sexually abused in a similar manner, including one whom Gacy encouraged to have sex with his own wife before [[blackmail]]ing the youth into performing oral sex upon him.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=265}} Gacy tricked several teenagers into believing he was commissioned with conducting homosexual experiments in the interests of \"scientific research\", for which each was paid up to $50.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=266}}\n\nIn March 1968, Voorhees reported to his father that Gacy had sexually assaulted him. Voorhees Sr. immediately informed the police and Gacy was arrested and subsequently charged with oral [[Sodomy law|sodomy]] in relation to Voorhees and the attempted assault of 16-year-old Edward Lynch.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=267}} Gacy vehemently denied the charges and demanded to take a [[polygraph test]]. This request was granted, although the results indicated Gacy was nervous when he denied any wrongdoing in relation to either Voorhees or Lynch.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=65}}\n\nGacy publicly denied any wrongdoing and insisted the charges against him were politically motivated \u2013 Voorhees Sr. had opposed Gacy's nomination for appointment as president of the Iowa Jaycees.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=66}} Several fellow Jaycees found Gacy's story credible and rallied to his support. However, on May 10, 1968, Gacy was indicted on the sodomy charge.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=65}}\n{{quote box\n| quote = ''\"The most striking aspect of the test results is the patient's total denial of responsibility for everything that has happened to him.

Schroeder agreed to lure Voorhees to a secluded spot, spray [[Mace (spray)|Mace]] in his face and beat him. Gacy promised to pay Schroeder $300 if he followed through on the plot. In early September, Schroeder lured Voorhees to an isolated county park, sprayed Mace supplied by Gacy into the youth's eyes, then beat him, all the while shouting that he was not to testify against Gacy at his upcoming trial.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=72}}<ref name=\"Michael H.

Schroeder was arrested the following day. Despite initially denying any involvement, he soon confessed to having assaulted Voorhees, indicating that he had done so at Gacy's request. Gacy was arrested and additionally charged in relation to hiring Schroeder to assault and [[Witness tampering|intimidate]] Voorhees.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|pp=268\u2013270}}\n\nOn September 12, Gacy was ordered to undergo a [[Psychological evaluation|psychiatric evaluation]] at the Psychiatric Hospital of the State University of Iowa.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|pp=270}} Two doctors had examined Gacy over a period of 17 days before concluding he had an [[antisocial personality disorder]] (a disorder which incorporates constructs such as [[sociopathy]] and [[psychopathy]]),<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/conditions/antisocial-personality-disorder |title=Antisocial Personality Disorder |magazine=[[Psychology Today]]|publisher=Sussex Publishers|location=New York City |date=April 19, 2017 |accessdate=January 13, 2018 }}</ref> was unlikely to benefit from any therapy or medical treatment, and that his behavior pattern was likely to bring him into repeated conflict with society.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|pp=272}} The doctors also concluded he was mentally competent to stand trial.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|pp=272}}\n\n=====Conviction and imprisonment=====\n[[File:John Wayne Gacy (mugshot).jpg|thumb|[[Mug shot]]s of Gacy, following his December 1968 sodomy conviction.]]\nUpon advice from his attorney, Gacy entered a plea of guilty to one count of sodomy in relation to the charges filed against him by Donald Voorhees. He pleaded not guilty to the other charges lodged against him by other youths at a formal [[arraignment]] held on November 7, 1968. Before the judge, Gacy contended that he and Voorhees had indeed engaged in sexual relations, yet he insisted Voorhees had offered his sexual services to him and that he had acted out of curiosity.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|pp=272}} His story was not believed. Despite his lawyers' recommendations for [[probation]],{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=84}} Gacy was convicted of sodomy on December 3, 1968,{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|pp=272}} and sentenced to 10 years at the [[Anamosa State Penitentiary]].{{sfn|Peck|Dolch|2001|p=260}} On the day Gacy was convicted and sentenced, his wife petitioned for [[divorce]],{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=85}} requesting possession of the couple's home, property, sole custody of their two children and subsequent [[alimony]] payments.{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|p=40}} The Court ruled in her favor and the divorce was finalized on September 18, 1969. Gacy never saw his first wife or children again.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=274}}\n\nDuring his incarceration in the Anamosa State Penitentiary, Gacy rapidly acquired a reputation as a model prisoner.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=273}} Within months of his arrival, he had risen to the position of head cook. He also joined the inmate Jaycee chapter and increased their membership figure from 50 to 650 in the span of less than 18 months. He is also known to have both secured an increase in the inmates' daily pay in the prison mess hall{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=88}} and to have supervised several projects to improve conditions for inmates at the prison.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=89}} On one occasion, Gacy oversaw the installation of a [[miniature golf]] course in the prison's recreation yard.<ref>''Serial Killers''. p. 62.</ref>\n\nIn June 1969, Gacy first applied to the State of Iowa Board of Parole for early release: this application was denied.

However, within 24 hours of his release, Gacy relocated to Chicago to live with his mother.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=276}} He arrived in Chicago on June 19 and shortly thereafter obtained a job as a [[short-order cook]] in a restaurant.{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|p=49}}\n\nOn February 12, 1971, Gacy was charged with sexually assaulting a teenage boy.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=95}} The youth claimed that Gacy had lured him into his car at Chicago's [[Greyhound Lines|Greyhound bus]] terminal and driven him to his home, where he had attempted to force the youth into sex. This complaint was subsequently dismissed when the youth failed to appear in court. The Iowa Board of Parole did not learn of this incident (which violated the conditions of his parole) and eight months later, in October 1971, Gacy's parole ended.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=96}} The following month, records of Gacy's previous criminal convictions in Iowa were subsequently [[Record sealing|sealed]].{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|p=53}}{{efn|Gacy successfully hid his [[criminal record]] from friends, business associates and political acquaintances; they only learned the truth of his past after police had begun investigating him for his later murders.{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|p=72}}{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|p=73}}}}\n\n===8213 West Summerdale Avenue===\nWith financial assistance from his mother, Gacy bought a house in Norwood Park Township, an [[unincorporated area]] of [[Cook County, Illinois|Cook County]], a part of metropolitan Chicago.

The business initially undertook minor repair work, such as sign-writing, pouring concrete, and redecorating, but later expanded to include projects such as interior design, [[remodeling]], installation, assembly, and [[landscaping]]. In mid-1973, Gacy quit his job as a cook in order that he could fully commit to his construction business.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=115}}\n\nMuch of the labor workforce consisted of high school students and young men.{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|p=1}} In 1973, Gacy and a teenage employee of PDM Contractors traveled to [[Florida]] to view property Gacy had purchased. On the first night in Florida, Gacy raped the youth in their hotel room.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=118}} As a result, the youth refused to stay in the same hotel room as Gacy and instead slept on the beach. Upon returning to Chicago, he drove to Gacy's house and beat him in his yard. Gacy's mother-in-law stopped the assault and he drove away. Gacy explained to his wife that the attack happened because he had refused to pay the youth for poor quality painting work.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|pp=117\u2013118}}\n\nAnother employee of Gacy's was 15-year-old Anthony Antonucci, whom he had hired in May 1975. In July 1975, Gacy arrived at Antonucci's home while the youth was alone, having injured his foot at work the day prior. Gacy plied him with alcohol, wrestled him to the floor and cuffed his hands behind his back.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=122-123}} The cuff upon Antonucci's right wrist was loose: Antonucci freed his arm from the [[handcuffs|handcuff]] after Gacy left the room.

He wrestled Gacy to the floor, obtained possession of the handcuff key and cuffed Gacy's hands behind his back. Gacy screamed threats, then calmed down and promised to leave if Antonucci removed the handcuffs. The youth agreed and Gacy left the house.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=122-123}} Antonucci later recalled that Gacy had told him as he lay prone on the floor: \"Not only are you the only one who got out of the cuffs; you got them on me.\"{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=123}}\n\nBy 1975, PDM Contractors was expanding rapidly; by his own later admission, he began working 12- and 16-hour days to fulfill agreed commitments upon an increasing number of contracts.

This behavior included hearing his car arrive and depart in the early hours of the morning; noting lights switching on and off in his home at odd hours and his keeping company with young males.<ref name=\"autogenerated28\" /> One neighbor later recollected that, for several years, she and her son had repeatedly been awoken by the repeated sounds of muffled screaming, shouting, and crying in the early morning hours, which she and her son identified as emanating from a house adjacent to theirs on Summerdale Avenue.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=274}}\n\n===Modus operandi===\nGacy typically abducted his victims from Chicago's Greyhound Bus station, from [[Washington Square Park (Chicago)|Bughouse Square]], or simply off the streets.

Gacy would then produce a pair of handcuffs, occasionally as part of a clowning routine. He typically cuffed his own hands behind his back, then surreptitiously released himself with the key, which he hid between his fingers,{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|p=18}} before offering to show his intended victim how to release himself from the handcuffs.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|pp=169\u2013170}} With his victim manacled and unable to free himself, Gacy then made a statement to the effect of: \"The trick is, you have to have the key\", before proceeding to rape and torture his captive.<ref name=\"Kozenczak\">Kozenczak (2012), pp. 200\u2013201</ref> Some victims were partly drowned in his bathtub before Gacy revived them, enabling him to continue his prolonged assault.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=331}} The victims were usually lured alone to his house, although on approximately three occasions, Gacy had what he called \"[[Double murder|doubles]]\"\u2014occasions wherein he killed two victims on the same evening.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=174}} With only two exceptions, all his victims were murdered between 3 a.m. and 6 a.m.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=179}}\n\nGacy typically murdered his victim by placing a rope around his victim's neck, forming a makeshift tourniquet which he repeatedly tightened with a hammer handle{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|p=21}} until the victim was strangled to death.<ref>Kozenczak (2012), pp. 201-203</ref> He referred to this act as the \"rope trick.\" Occasionally, the victim had [[convulse]]d for an \"hour or two\" after the rope trick before dying. In several instances, cloth gags stuffed into the victim's mouth caused Gacy's victim to die of asphyxiation as opposed to strangulation.<ref name=\"Kozenczak\" />\n\nAfter death, the victims' bodies were typically stored beneath his bed for up to 24 hours before Gacy buried his victim in the crawl space, where he periodically poured [[Calcium oxide|quicklime]] to hasten the decomposition of the bodies.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=177}} The bodies of some victims would be taken to his garage and [[embalming|embalmed]] prior to their burial.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=345}}\n\n===1976===\n[[File:CousinKevinscreenshot1980.jpg|200px|right|thumb|Victims Darrell Samson and Gregory Godzik.

While Gacy was within earshot of 15-year-old, part-time employee Robert Piest, he mentioned that his firm hired teenage boys at a starting wage of $5 per hour\u2014almost double the pay Piest earned at the pharmacy.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|pp=5\u20136}}{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=4}}\n\nShortly after Gacy left the pharmacy, Piest informed his mother\u2014who had arrived at the pharmacy to drive her son home\u2014that \"some contractor wants to talk to me about a job\". Piest left the store, promising to return shortly.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=7}}\n\n==Investigation==\nWhen Piest failed to return, his family filed a [[missing person]] report on their son with the Des Plaines police.

Kozenczak|Joseph Kozenczak]] chose to investigate Gacy further.<ref>Kozenczak (2012), pp. 26-27</ref>\n\nKozenczak and two other Des Plaines police officers visited Gacy at his home the following evening. Gacy indicated he had seen two youths working at the pharmacy and that he had asked one of them\u2014whom he believed to be Piest\u2014whether any remodeling materials were present in the rear of the store.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|pp=19\u201321}} He was adamant, however, that he had not offered Piest a job and promised to come to the station later that evening to make a statement confirming this, indicating he was unable to do so at that moment as his uncle had just died. When questioned as to how soon he could come to the police station, he responded: \"You guys are very rude. Don't you have any respect for the dead?\"{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=240}}\n\nAt 3:20&nbsp;a.m., Gacy, covered in mud, arrived at the police station, claiming he had been involved in a car accident.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=23}} Upon returning to the police station later that day, Gacy denied any involvement in the disappearance of Piest and repeated that he had not offered him a job. When asked why he had returned to the pharmacy at 8 p.m. Gacy claimed he had done so in response to a phone call from Torf informing him he had left his appointment book at the store. Detectives had already spoken with Torf, who had stated he had placed no such call to Gacy.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=27}} At the request of detectives, Gacy prepared a written statement detailing his movements on December 11.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=28}}\n\n===Revelations===\nDes Plaines police were convinced Gacy was behind Piest's disappearance and checked Gacy's record, discovering that he had an outstanding battery charge against him in Chicago and had served a prison sentence in Iowa for the sodomy of a 15-year-old boy.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=17}} A search of Gacy's house on December 13 was ordered by a judge at the request of detectives and revealed several suspicious items. These included a [[syringe]], several police badges, and a 6mm Brevettata [[starter pistol]]. They also found handcuffs, books on homosexuality and [[pederasty]], a 39 inch long [[Dimensional lumber#Dimensional lumber|two-by-four]] with two holes drilled into each end,{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=33}} several driver's licenses, a blue hooded parka and underwear too small to fit Gacy.<ref>Kozenczak (2012), p. 61</ref>\n\nIn the northwest bedroom, investigators found a [[Maine West High School]] ring. This item initially interested investigators as Piest had attended Maine West, but the ring was not his. It was a class of 1975 ring engraved with the initials J.A.S.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=243}}{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=87}} A photo receipt from Nisson Pharmacy was also recovered from a trash can.<ref>Kozenczak (2012), p. 61</ref>\n\nGacy's Oldsmobile and other PDM work vehicles were confiscated by the Des Plaines police, who assigned two two-man [[surveillance]] teams to monitor Gacy on a rotational twelve-hour basis as they continued their investigation into his background and potential involvement in Piest's disappearance.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Murder casebook number 84 {{ISBN|0-7485-1454-6}}, p. 1915</ref> These surveillance teams consisted of officers Mike Albrecht and David Hachmeister, and Ronald Robinson and Robert Schultz.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=41}} The following day, investigators received a phone call from Michael Rossi, who informed the investigators both of Gregory Godzik's disappearance and the fact that another PDM employee, Charles Hattula, had been found drowned in an Illinois river the previous year.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=53}}{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=123}}\n\nOn December 15, Des Plaines investigators obtained further details upon Gacy's battery charge, learning the complainant, Jeffrey Rignall, had reported that Gacy had lured him into his car, chloroformed him, raped him and dumped him, with severe chest and facial burns and rectal bleeding, in Lincoln Park the following morning. In an interview with Gacy's former wife the same day, they learned of the disappearance of John Butkovich.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=84}} The same day, the Maine West High School ring was traced to a John Alan Szyc.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|pp=53\u201355}} In an interview with Szyc's mother the same day, she informed officers of the January 1977 disappearance of her son and that several items from his apartment were also missing, including a Motorola TV set.<ref>Kozenczak (2012), p. 117</ref>\n\nBy December 16, Gacy was becoming affable with the surveillance detectives, regularly inviting them to join him for meals in restaurants and occasionally for drinks in bars or within his home. He repeatedly denied that he had anything to do with Piest's disappearance and accused the officers of harassing him because of his political connections or because of his recreational drug use. Knowing these officers were unlikely to arrest him on anything trivial, he openly taunted them by flouting traffic laws and succeeded in losing his pursuers on more than one occasion.{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|p=89}}\n\nOn December 17, investigators conducted a formal interview of Michael Rossi, who informed them Gacy had sold Szyc's vehicle to him with the explanation that he had bought the car from Szyc because the youth needed money to move to California. A further examination of Gacy's Oldsmobile was conducted on this date. In the course of examining the trunk of the car, the investigators discovered a small cluster of fibers which may have been human hair. These fibers were sent for further analysis. That evening, officers conducted a test using three trained [[German shepherd]] [[Search and rescue dog|search dogs]] to determine whether Piest had been present in any of Gacy's vehicles.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=93}} The dogs were allowed to examine each of Gacy's vehicles, whereupon one dog approached Gacy's Oldsmobile and lay upon the passenger seat in what the dog's handler informed investigators was a \"death reaction\", indicating the body of Robert Piest had been present in this vehicle.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=93}}\n\nThat evening, Gacy invited two of the surveillance detectives to a restaurant for a meal. In the early hours of December 18, he invited the same officers into another restaurant where, over breakfast, he talked of his business, his marriages and his activities as a registered clown. At one point during this conversation, Gacy remarked to one of the two surveillance detectives: \"You know\u2026 clowns can get away with murder.\"{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|p=226}}{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=90}}\n\n===Civil suit===\nBy December 18, Gacy was beginning to show visible signs of strain as a result of the constant surveillance: he was unshaven, looked tired, appeared anxious and was drinking heavily. That afternoon, he drove to his lawyers' office to prepare a $750,000 [[civil suit]] against the Des Plaines police,{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=102}} demanding that they cease their surveillance. The same day, the serial number of the Nisson Pharmacy photo receipt found in Gacy's kitchen was traced to 17-year-old Kim Byers, a colleague of Piest at Nisson Pharmacy, who admitted when contacted in person the following day that she had worn the jacket and had placed the receipt in the [[Anorak|parka]] pocket just before she gave the parka to Piest as he left the store to talk with a contractor.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=110}} This revelation contradicted Gacy's previous statements that he had had no contact with Robert Piest on the evening of December 11.{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|pp=116\u2013117}}\n\nThe same evening, Michael Rossi was interviewed a second time: on this occasion, Rossi was more cooperative, informing detectives that in the summer of 1977, Gacy had had him spread ten bags of [[Lime (material)|lime]] in the crawl space of the house.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=143}}\n\nOn December 19, investigators began compiling evidence for a second search warrant of Gacy's house. The same day, Gacy's lawyers filed the civil suit against the Des Plaines police. The hearing of the suit was scheduled for December 22. That afternoon, Gacy invited two of the surveillance detectives inside his house. On this occasion, as one officer distracted Gacy with conversation, another officer walked into Gacy's bedroom in an unsuccessful attempt to write down the serial number of the Motorola TV set they suspected belonged to John Szyc. While flushing Gacy's toilet, this officer noticed a smell he suspected could be that of rotting corpses emanating from a [[heating duct]]; the officers who previously searched Gacy's house had failed to notice this, as on that occasion the house had been cold.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" />\n\nBoth David Cram and Michael Rossi were interviewed by investigators on December 20. Rossi had agreed to be interviewed in relation to his possible links with John Szyc as well as the disappearance of Robert Piest. When questioned by Kozenczak as to where he believed Gacy had placed Piest's body, Rossi replied: \"In the crawl space; he could have put him in the crawl space.\"<ref>Kozenczak (2012), p. 147</ref> A polygraph test showed his responses to questions to be inconclusive; however, upon his agreeing to a subsequent visual test in which a map of Cook County was divided into 12 [[Grid plan|grid sections]] numbered 1 to 12, with Gacy's home marked in the fourth grid section, Kozenczak noted an extreme response in Rossi's [[blood pressure]] when asked: \"Is the body of Robert Piest buried in grid number 4?\"<ref>Kozenczak, Joseph R.; Kozenczak, Karen M.

Cram then stated Gacy had grabbed a flashlight and immediately entered the crawl space to look for evidence of digging. When asked whether he had been to the crawl space, Cram replied he had been asked by Gacy to spread lime down there and also dug trenches upon Gacy's behest with the explanation they were for plumbing.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=143}} Cram stated these trenches were {{convert|2|ft|m|sp=us}} wide, {{convert|6|ft|m|sp=us}} long and {{convert|2|ft|m|sp=us}} deep\u2014the size of graves.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|pp=143\u2013145}}\n\n===Verbal confession===\nOn the evening of December 20, Gacy drove to his lawyers' office in [[Park Ridge, Illinois|Park Ridge]] to attend a pre-scheduled meeting he had arranged with them, ostensibly to discuss the progress of his civil suit. Upon his arrival, Gacy appeared disheveled and immediately asked for an alcoholic drink, whereupon Sam Amirante fetched a bottle of whiskey from his car. Upon his return, Amirante asked Gacy what he had to discuss with them. Gacy picked up a copy of the ''[[Chicago Daily Herald|Daily Herald]]'' from Amirante's desk; he pointed to a front-page article covering the disappearance of Robert Piest and informed his lawyers: \"This boy is dead. He's in a river.\"{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|p=136}}\n\nOver the following hours, Gacy gave a rambling confession that ran into the early hours of the following morning. He began by informing Amirante and Stevens he had \"been the judge ... jury and executioner of many, many people\",<ref>Amirante & Broderick 2011, p. 127</ref> most of whom he stated were buried in his crawl space, and others in the Des Plaines River. Some victims he referred to by name; most he dismissed as \"[[Male prostitution|male prostitutes]]\", \"hustlers\" and \"liars\" to whom he gave \"the rope trick\". On other occasions, he stated he woke up to find \"dead, strangled kids\" on his floor, with their hands cuffed behind their back.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=171}} In reference to Robert Piest, Gacy stated that as he placed the tourniquet around his neck, that Piest was \"crying, scared\".<ref>Amirante & Broderick 2011, p. 140</ref>\n\nAs a result of the alcohol he had consumed, Gacy fell asleep midway through his confession and Amirante immediately arranged a psychiatric appointment for Gacy at 9 a.m. that morning. Upon awakening several hours later, Gacy simply shook his head when informed by Amirante he had earlier confessed to killing approximately 30 people, stating: \"Well, I can't think about this right now. I've got things to do.\"<ref name=\"Amirante & Broderick 2011, p. 150\">Amirante & Broderick 2011, p. 150</ref> Ignoring his lawyers' advice regarding his scheduled appointment, Gacy left their office to attend to the needs of his business.<ref name=\"Amirante & Broderick 2011, p. 150\" />\n\nGacy later recollected his memories of his final day of freedom as being \"hazy\", adding that he knew his arrest was inevitable and that, in his final hours of freedom, he intended to visit his friends and say his final farewells.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|pp=255\u2013258}} Upon leaving his lawyers' office, Gacy drove to a Shell gas station where, in the course of filling his rental car, he handed a small bag of [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] to the attendant, Lance Jacobson. Jacobson immediately handed the bag to the surveillance officers, adding that Gacy had told him: \"The end is coming (for me). These guys are going to kill me.\" Gacy then drove to the home of a fellow contractor, Ronald Rhode. Inside Rhode's living room, Gacy hugged Rhode before bursting into tears and saying: \"I killed thirty people, give or take a few.\" Gacy then left Rhode's home to meet with Michael Rossi and David Cram. As he drove along the expressway, the surveillance officers noted he was holding a [[Catholic rosary|rosary]] to his chin as he prayed while driving.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=152}}\n\nAfter talking with Cram and Rossi at Cram's home, Gacy had Cram drive him to a scheduled meeting with Leroy Stevens. As he spoke with his lawyer, Cram informed the officers that Gacy had earlier divulged to both himself and Rossi that the previous evening, he had confessed to his lawyers his guilt in over thirty murders. Upon concluding his meeting with his lawyer, Gacy had Cram drive him to Maryhill Cemetery, where his father was buried.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=259}}\n\nAs Gacy drove to various locations that morning, police outlined their formal draft of their second search warrant. The purpose of the warrant was specifically to search for the body of Robert Piest in the crawl space. Upon hearing radioed reports from the surveillance detectives that, in light of his erratic behavior, Gacy might be about to commit suicide, police decided to arrest him upon a charge of possession and distribution of marijuana{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=157}} in order to hold him in custody as the formal request for a second search warrant was presented. At 4:30 on the afternoon of December 21, the eve of the hearing of Gacy's civil suit, the request for a second search warrant was granted by Judge Marvin J. Peters.<ref>Kozenczak, (2012) p. 158</ref>\n\nArmed with the signed search warrant, police and evidence technicians quickly drove to Gacy's home. Upon their arrival, officers found that Gacy had unplugged his [[sump pump]] and that the crawl space was flooded with water; to clear the water they simply replaced the plug and waited for the water to drain. After it had done so, evidence technician Daniel Genty entered the {{convert|28|x|38|ft|adj=on}} crawl space,<ref>''Serial Killers''. p. 50.</ref> crawled to the southwest area, and began digging. Within minutes, he had uncovered [[putrefaction|putrefied]] flesh and a human arm bone. Genty immediately shouted to the investigators that they could charge Gacy with murder.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=167}} Genty added the remark: \"I think this place is full of kids.\"{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=167}}\n\n==Arrest and confession==\n[[File:Gacycrawlspace.png|thumb|260px|Gacy's diagram of the burial locations of his victims within his basement and the investigators' subsequent diagram of the crawl space.]]After being informed that the police had found human remains in his crawl space and that he would now face murder charges, Gacy told officers he wanted to \"clear the air\",{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=171}} adding that he knew his arrest was inevitable since he had spent the previous evening on the couch in his lawyers' office.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=170}}\n\nIn the early hours of December 22, 1978, Gacy confessed to police that since 1972, he had committed 25 to 30 murders, all of whom he falsely claimed were of teenage male [[Runaway (dependent)|runaway]]s or male prostitutes.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=174}} When asked where he drew the inspiration for the two-by-four attached with manacles at either end found at his house, Gacy stated he had been inspired to construct the device from reading about the [[Dean Corll|Houston Mass Murders]].{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=197}}{{efn|The Houston Mass Murders were a series of killings uncovered in 1973 in which Dean Corll, with two teenaged accomplices, had also used a wooden device (in their case a board fitted with handcuffs at each corner) to restrain their male victims throughout their sexual abuse and torture.<ref>{{Cite book|title = The Man with the Candy: The Story of the Houston Mass Murders|last = Olsen|first = Jack|publisher = Simon and Schuster|year = 2008|isbn = 978-1-439-12870-1 |page = 146}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title = How to Make a Serial Killer: The Twisted Development of Innocent Children Into the World's Most Sadistic Murderers|last = Berry-Dee|first = Christopher|publisher = Ulysses Press|year = 2008|isbn = 978-1-569-75943-1|location = |page = 202}}</ref> Gacy was likely inspired by press coverage relating to the Houston Mass Murders to construct this device to restrain his victims, and to dupe his victim into donning handcuffs, as several victims of the Houston Mass Murders had been.{{sfn|Berry-Dee|2009|p=138}}}} In January 1979, he had planned to further conceal the corpses by covering the entire crawl space with concrete.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=222}} \n\nWhen specifically questioned about Piest, Gacy confessed to strangling him at his house on the evening of December 11 after luring him there.

Those doctors refuted the defense doctors' claims of multiple personality and insanity. Cram and Rossi both confessed that Gacy had made them dig trenches in his crawl space. Cram testified that in August 1977, Gacy had marked a location in the crawl space with sticks and told him to dig a [[Drainage#Drainage in construction|drainage]] trench.<ref name=\"The Montreal Gazette Feb. 13, 1980\" />{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=181}}{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=311}}\n\nImmediately after Cram had completed his testimony, Rossi testified for the state. When asked where he had dug in the crawl space, Rossi turned to a diagram of Gacy's home on display in the courtroom. This diagram showed where the bodies were found in the crawl space and elsewhere on the property. Rossi pointed to the location of the remains of an unidentified victim known as \"Body 13\".{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=311}} Rossi stated he had not dug any other trenches, but\u2014at Gacy's request\u2014had supervised other PDM employees digging trenches in the crawl space.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=181}}\n\nBoth Rossi and Cram also testified that Gacy periodically looked into the crawl space to ensure they and other employees ordered to dig trenches in the crawl space did not deviate from the precise locations he had marked.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=312}} Gacy had testified after his arrest that he had only dug five of the victims' graves in his crawl space{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|p=142}} and had his employees (including Gregory Godzik) dig the remaining trenches so that he would \"have graves available\".{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=360}}\n\nOn February 18, Dr. Robert Stein,{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=321}} the Cook County medical examiner appointed to supervise the exhumation of the victims' bodies from Gacy's home, testified as to how he and his colleagues had conducted the recovery of the remains.

Rignall repeatedly wept as he recounted his ordeal. In response to questioning relating to whether Gacy appreciated the criminality of his actions, Rignall stated his belief that Gacy was unable to conform his actions to the conduct of law because of the \"beastly and animalistic ways he attacked me\".<ref>Amirante & Broderick 2011, p. 290</ref> Upon specific cross-examination relating to the torture he had endured, Rignall vomited before he was excused from further testimony.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=300}}\n\nOn February 29, Donald Voorhees, whom Gacy had sexually assaulted in 1967, testified to his ordeal at Gacy's hands, and that Gacy had subsequently paid another youth to beat him and spray Mace in his face so he would not testify against him.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=340}} Voorhees felt unable to testify, but did briefly attempt to do so, before being asked to step down.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=340}}\n\nRobert Donnelly testified the week after Voorhees, recounting his ordeal at Gacy's hands in December 1977. Donnelly was visibly distressed as he recollected the abuse he endured at Gacy's hands and came close to breaking down on several occasions. As Donnelly testified, Gacy repeatedly laughed at him,{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=333}} but Donnelly finished his testimony. One of Gacy's defense attorneys, Robert Motta, during Donnelly's cross-examination, attempted to discredit his testimony, but Donnelly did not waver from his testimony of what had occurred.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=345}}\n\nDuring the fifth week of the trial, Gacy wrote a personal letter to Judge Garippo requesting a [[mistrial]]{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=342}} on a number of bases, including that he did not approve his lawyers' insanity plea approach; that his lawyers had not allowed him to take the witness stand (as he had desired to do); that his defense had not called enough witnesses, and that the police were lying about statements he had purportedly made to detectives after his arrest and that, in any event, the statements were \"self-serving\" for use by the prosecution.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|pp=350\u2013351}} Judge Garippo addressed Gacy's letter by informing him that under the law he had the choice as to whether he wished to testify, and he was free to indicate as much to the judge if he wished to do so.{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|p=312}}\n\n===Closing arguments===\nOn March 11, final arguments from both prosecution and defense attorneys began, with the arguments concluding on the following day. Prosecuting attorney Terry Sullivan argued first, outlining Gacy's history of abusing youths, the testimony of his efforts to avoid detection and describing Gacy's surviving victims\u2014Voorhees and Donnelly\u2014as \"living dead\".{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=361}} Referring to Gacy as the \"worst of all murderers\",<ref>Amirante & Broderick 2011, p. 324</ref> Sullivan stated: \"John Gacy has accounted for more human devastation than many earthly catastrophes, but one must tremble. I tremble when thinking about just how close he came to getting away with it all.\"{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=361}}\n\nAfter the state's four-hour closing, counsel Sam Amirante argued for the defense. Amirante argued against the testimony delivered by the doctors who had testified for the prosecution, repeatedly citing the testimony of the four psychiatrists and psychologists who had testified on behalf of the defense.{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|p=360}} Amirante also accused Sullivan of scarcely referring to the evidence presented throughout the trial in his own closing argument, and of arousing hatred against his client. The defense lawyer attempted to portray Gacy as a \"man driven by compulsions he was unable to control\".{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=363}}\n\nIn support of these arguments, the defense counsel repeatedly referred to the testimony of the doctors who had appeared for the defense, in addition to the testimony of defense witnesses such as Jeffrey Rignall and Gacy's former business associate Mickel Reed\u2014both of whom had testified to their belief that Gacy had been unable to control his actions.{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|p=359}} Amirante then urged the jury to put aside any prejudice they held against his client, and requested they deliver a verdict of not guilty by reason of insanity, adding that the psychology of Gacy's behavior would be of benefit to scientific research and that the psychology of his mind should be studied.{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|p=361}}\n\n[[File:Kunkletrial.jpg|200px|thumb|William Kunkle, prosecutor at Gacy's trial, standing before a board depicting the 22 victims identified by February 1980.]]\nOn the morning of March 12,{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|p=364}} William Kunkle continued to argue for the prosecution. Kunkle referred to the defense's contention of insanity as \"a [[falsity|sham]]\", arguing that the facts of the case demonstrated Gacy's ability to think logically and control his actions. Kunkle also referred to the testimony of a doctor who had examined Gacy in 1968. This doctor had diagnosed Gacy as an [[antisocial personality]], capable of committing crimes without remorse. Kunkle indicated that had the recommendations of this doctor been heeded, Gacy would have not been freed.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=368}}\n\nAt the close of his argument, Kunkle pulled each of the 22 photos of Gacy's identified victims off a board displaying the images and asked the jury not to show sympathy but to \"show justice\". Kunkle then asked the jury to \"show the same sympathy this man showed when he took these lives and put them ''there!''{{-\"}}{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=368}} before throwing the stack of photos into the opening of the trap door of Gacy's crawl space, which had been introduced as evidence and was on display in the courtroom.

Amirante has since stated that the primary inspiration for this legislation was the fact that at the time of the Gacy murders, there had been a 72-hour period which police in Illinois had to allow to elapse before initiating a search for a missing child or adolescent.{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|page= 395}}\n\nThe Illinois Missing Child Recovery Act of 1984 removed this 72-hour waiting period. Other states across America subsequently adopted similar procedures and sensibilities, as a result of which a national network aimed at locating missing children was gradually formed. This national network has since developed into the Child Abduction Emergency\u2014commonly known today as an [[Amber Alert]].{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|page= 395}}\n\n==Potential accomplices and connections==\nOne of the first things Gacy told investigators after his arrest was that he had not acted alone in several of the murders: he asked whether \"my associates\" had also been arrested.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=171}} When questioned as to whether these associates had participated directly or indirectly in the killings, Gacy replied, \"Directly.\"{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=171}}\n\nGacy specifically named Cram and Rossi as being involved in several of the murders.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=171}} In the 1980s, he also informed [[Robert Ressler]] that \"two or three\" PDM employees had assisted him in several murders.<ref>Whoever Fights Monsters {{ISBN|0-671-71561-5}} pp 341\u2013342</ref> Ressler replied that he believed there were unexplained avenues to the case and stated his belief that Gacy had killed more than 33 victims. Gacy neither confirmed nor denied Ressler's suspicions.{{efn|Gacy is known to have given Ressler a painting with a written inscription reading: \"Dear Bob Ressler, You cannot hope to enjoy the harvest, without first laboring in the fields\".<ref>Whoever Fights Monsters {{ISBN|0-671-71561-5}} p 343</ref>}}\n\nJeffrey Rignall, who had been assaulted and tortured by Gacy in March 1978, was adamant that at one point during his abuse and torture, a young man with brown hair, kneeling before him, watched his abuse.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=209}} When this youth realized Rignall had regained consciousness, he was again chloroformed into unconsciousness. Rignall also informed police that as Gacy was raping and assaulting him, a light was switched on in another part of the house.<ref name=\"google2963\">{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1876&dat=19790101&id=PEEsAAAAIBAJ&sjid=v80EAAAAIBAJ&pg=2963,232748|title=Herald-Journal \u2013 Google News Archive Search|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nMoreover, on one occasion during the surveillance of Gacy prior to his arrest, two of the surveillance officers followed Gacy to a bar to which Gacy had driven to meet two of his employees. At the bar, the surveillance officers overheard a hushed conversation between Gacy and one of his employees in which the youth asked Gacy the question: \"And what? Buried like the other five?\"{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=102}}\n\nIn interviews following his arrest and conviction, Gacy repeatedly claimed that he was not present in Chicago when 16 of the identified victims had disappeared. In one interview, he stated that at the time of his arrest, four PDM employees were also considered suspects in the disappearances of the missing boys investigators had linked to Gacy\u2014all of whom he stated were in possession of keys to his house.<ref>Whoever Fights Monsters {{ISBN|0-671-71561-5}} pp=341\u2013342</ref> One of these employees was Philip Paske, a young man who is known to have been a close associate of John Norman.

To Nelson's family, Young had stated Nelson failed to arrive at a bar at a prearranged time; to investigators, Young claimed he had last seen Nelson standing among a crowd who had gathered outside a Chicago bar and when his attention was diverted for a few moments, Nelson simply disappeared.

During the time of the murders, he remained active in his community, regularly performing at events as his own characters, \"Pogo the [[Clown]]\" or \"Patches the Clown\", and so is known as the \"Killer Clown\". His first murder occurred in 1972 and at least 30 of his subsequent murders were committed after the divorce of his second wife in 1976. Investigation into the case of missing [[Des Plaines, Illinois|Des Plaines]] teenager Robert Piest led to Gacy's arrest on December 21, 1978.\n\nGacy was convicted of the [[sodomy]] of a teenage boy in Iowa in 1968. He was sentenced to 10 years' imprisonment, but was released from prison on good behavior; and returned to his home state of Illinois. It is believed all of his known murders were committed inside his [[Ranch-style house|ranch house]] in [[Norwood Park Township, Cook County, Illinois|Norwood Park]], a part of [[Chicago metropolitan area|metropolitan Chicago]]. Once lured to his home by force or deception, his victims were typically duped into donning [[handcuffs]] on the pretext of being shown a [[Magic (illusion)|magic trick]] and then raped and tortured before being murdered by either [[asphyxiation]] or [[strangulation]] with a makeshift [[garrote]].\n\n26 of Gacy's victims were buried in the [[Crawl space (basement)|crawl space]] of his home. Three other victims were buried elsewhere on his property, while the bodies of his last four known victims were discarded in the [[Des Plaines River]]. The conviction for 33 murders was then the largest number of murders charged to one individual in United States history. Gacy was sentenced to death on March 13, 1980 for 12 of those murders. He spent 14 years on death row at [[Menard Correctional Center]], spending much of his time painting, and was executed by [[lethal injection]] at [[Stateville Correctional Center]] on May 10, 1994.\n\n==Early life==\nJohn Wayne Gacy was born in Chicago, [[Illinois]] on March 17, 1942, the second child and only son of John Stanley Gacy (June 20, 1900 \u2013 December 25, 1969) and Marion Elaine Robinson (May 4, 1908 \u2013 December 6, 1989).<ref>''Serial Killers''. p. 63.</ref> His father was an auto repair machinist and [[World War I]] veteran,{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=24}} and his mother was a homemaker.<ref>Cook County marriage records provide his mother's name as Marion E.

He was close to his two sisters and mother but endured a difficult relationship with his father, an [[alcoholic]] who was [[physical abuse|physically abusive]] to his wife and children.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|pp=256\u2013257}} Gacy seldom received his father's approval, later recollecting that, no matter what he achieved, he was \"never good enough\" in his father's eyes.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|pp=31}}  His father regularly belittled him, calling him \"dumb and stupid\" and comparing him unfavorably with his sisters.<ref>''Serial Killers.'' pp. 54\u201355.</ref> Despite this, Gacy always denied ever hating his father.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=21}} \n\nOne of Gacy's earliest childhood memories was of being beaten with a leather belt at the age of four for accidentally disarranging car engine components his father had assembled.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|pp=18\u201319}} On another occasion, he was struck across the head with a broomstick and rendered [[Unconsciousness|unconscious]].<ref>{{cite book | first1=Jason| last1=Moss| first2=Jeffrey| last2=Kottler| title=The Last Victim: A True-life Journey into the Mind of the Serial Killer| publisher=Grand Central Publishing| location=New York City| date=2000|isbn=0-7535-0398-0| p=103}}</ref> When he was six years old, Gacy stole a toy truck from a neighborhood store. His mother made him walk back to the store, return the toy and apologize to the owners. His mother informed his father, who beat Gacy with a belt as punishment. After this incident, Gacy's mother attempted to shield her son from his father's verbal and physical abuse,{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=26}} yet this only succeeded in Gacy earning accusations that he was a \"[[sissy]]\" and a \"Mama's boy\"{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=257}} who would \"probably grow up [[queer]]\".{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=40}}\n\nIn 1949, Gacy's father was informed that his son and another boy had been caught sexually fondling a young girl.{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|p=218}} Gacy's father whipped him with a [[razor strop]] as punishment. The same year,{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=17}} Gacy was [[child molestation|molested]] by a family friend,{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=257}} a contractor who would take Gacy for rides in his truck and then fondle him. Gacy never told his father about these incidents, afraid that his father would blame him.<ref name=\"Serial Killers. p. 54\">''Serial Killers''. p. 54.</ref>\n\nBecause of a heart condition, Gacy was ordered to avoid all sports at school.<ref name=\"Serial Killers. p. 54\" /> During the fourth grade, Gacy began to experience [[Syncope (medicine)|blackout]]s. He was occasionally hospitalized because of these seizures, and also in 1957 for a [[appendicitis|burst appendix]].{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|p=18}} Gacy later estimated that between the ages of 14 and 18, he had spent almost a year in the hospital for these episodes, and attributed the decline of his grades to his missing school. His father suspected the episodes were an effort to gain sympathy and attention, and openly accused his son of faking the condition as the boy lay in a hospital bed.<ref>{{cite journal | title=Murder In Mind |issue=11 |issn=1364-5803 |page=5}}</ref> Although his mother, sisters, and few close friends never doubted his illness, Gacy's medical condition was never conclusively diagnosed.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=32}}\n\nOne of Gacy's friends at high school recalled several instances in which his father ridiculed or beat his son without provocation. On one occasion in 1957, the same friend witnessed an incident at the Gacy household in which Gacy's father began shouting at his son for no reason, then began hitting him.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=33}} Gacy's mother attempted to intervene. The friend recalled that Gacy simply \"put up his hands to defend himself\", adding that he never struck his father back during these physical altercations.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|pp=32\u201333}}\n\n===Career origins===\nIn 1960, at the age of 18, Gacy became involved in politics, working as an assistant [[precinct captain]] for a [[U.S. Democratic Party|Democratic Party]] candidate in his neighborhood. This decision earned more criticism from his father, who accused his son of being a \"[[wikt:Special:Search/dupe|patsy]]\". Gacy later speculated the decision may have been an attempt to seek the acceptance from others that he never received from his father.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=36}}\n\nThe same year Gacy became a Democratic candidate, his father bought him a car, with the title of the vehicle being in his father's name until Gacy had completed the monthly repayments.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=42}} These repayments took several years to complete, and his father would confiscate the keys to the vehicle if Gacy did not do as his father said. On one occasion in 1962, Gacy bought an extra set of keys after his father confiscated the original set. In response, his father removed the [[distributor cap]] from the vehicle, withholding the component for three days. \n\n==== Palm Mortuary in Las Vegas ====\nGacy recalled that as a result of this incident, he felt \"totally sick; drained\".{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=44}} When his father replaced the distributor cap, Gacy left the family home and drove to [[Las Vegas]], [[Nevada]], where he found work within the ambulance service before he was transferred to work as an attendant at Palm Mortuary. \n\nIn his role as a mortuary attendant, Gacy slept on a cot behind the [[embalming]] room.<ref>{{cite book|first=Tim|last=Cahill|url=https://books.google.com/?id=OF6itYw0HT0C&pg=PT30&lpg=PT30#v=onepage&q/ |title=Buried Dreams: Inside the Mind of a Serial Killer|publisher=[[Bantam Books]] |location=New York City|date=1986|access-date=March 14, 2013|isbn=978-0553051155}}</ref> He worked in this role for three months.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=258}} In this role, he observed morticians embalming dead bodies and later confessed that, on one evening while alone, he had clambered into the coffin of a deceased teenage male, embracing and caressing the body before experiencing a sense of shock.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=46}}{{efn|Gacy later claimed to have engaged in acts of [[necrophilia]] on approximately two occasions while he worked at Palm Mortuary. He justified his actions by claiming the bodies he had defiled were \"just dead things\" who \"couldn't tell anybody\".{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=346}}}} This prompted Gacy to call his mother the next day and ask whether his father would allow him to return home.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=46}} His father agreed and the same day, Gacy drove back to live with his family in Chicago.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=347}}\n\n==== Nunn-Bush Shoe Company ====\nUpon his return, despite the fact he had failed to graduate from high school, Gacy successfully enrolled in the [[Northwestern College (Illinois)|Northwestern Business College]],{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=47}} from which he graduated in 1963. Gacy subsequently took a management trainee position within the Nunn-Bush Shoe Company.{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|pp=18\u201319}} In 1964, the shoe company transferred Gacy to [[Springfield, Illinois|Springfield]] to work as a salesman.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=258}} He was eventually promoted to manager of his department. In March of that year, he became engaged to Marlynn Myers, a co-worker in the department he managed.{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|p=21}}\n\n==== Springfield Jaycees ====\nDuring his courtship with Marlynn, Gacy joined the local [[Jaycees]] and became a tireless worker for the organization, being named Key Man for the organization in April 1964.<ref>''Serial Killers''. p. 58.</ref> The same year, Gacy had his second homosexual experience. According to Gacy, he acquiesced to this incident after one of his colleagues in the Springfield Jaycees plied him with drinks and invited him to spend the evening upon his sofa; the colleague then performed [[oral sex]] upon him while he was drunk.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">{{cite journal |title=Murder In Mind |issue=11 |publisher=Marshall Cavendish Printworks|location=London, England|issn=1364-5803 |page=7}}</ref> By 1965, Gacy had risen to the position of vice-president of the Springfield Jaycees.{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|pp=20\u201322}} The same year, he was named as the third most outstanding Jaycee within the state of Illinois.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=48}}\n\n==Waterloo, Iowa==\nAfter a nine-month courtship, Gacy and Myers married in September 1964. Marlynn's father subsequently purchased three [[Kentucky Fried Chicken]] restaurants in [[Waterloo, Iowa|Waterloo]], [[Iowa]], and the couple moved to Waterloo so he could manage the restaurants, with the understanding that they would move into Marlynn's parents' home (which was vacated for the couple).{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|p=21}}{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|pp=261\u2013262}} The offer was lucrative: Gacy would receive $15,000 per year (the equivalent of $115,513 {{as of|2020|lc=y|df=US}}), plus a share of profits earned via the restaurants.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=50}} Following his obligatory completion of a managerial course, Gacy relocated to Waterloo with his wife later that year.{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|pp=23\u201325}}\n\n=== Waterloo Jaycees ===\nIn Waterloo, Gacy joined the local chapter of the Jaycees, regularly offering extended hours to the organization in addition to the 12- and 14-hour days he worked managing three restaurants. Although considered ambitious and something of a braggart by his colleagues in the Jaycees, he was highly regarded as a worker on several fund-raising projects. In 1967, he was named \"outstanding vice-president\" of the Waterloo Jaycees.{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|p=28}} At Jaycee meetings, Gacy often provided free fried chicken to his colleagues and insisted upon being given the nickname \"[[Colonel Sanders|Colonel]]\".{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=51}} The same year, Gacy served on the Board of Directors for the Waterloo Jaycees.{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|p=51}}\n\nGacy's wife gave birth to two children: a son was born in February 1966, followed by a daughter in March 1967. Gacy himself later described this period of his life as \"perfect\", adding that he finally earned the long-sought approval of his father. On one occasion in July 1966, Gacy's parents paid a visit to Iowa, during which his father apologized privately to him for the physical and emotional abuse he had inflicted on him throughout his childhood, before proudly informing him: \"Son, I was wrong about you.\"{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=53}}\n\nHowever, there was an unseemlier side of Jaycee life in Waterloo that involved [[wife swapping]],<ref name=\"ReferenceB\" /> [[prostitution]], [[pornography]], and drug use. Gacy was deeply involved in many of these activities and regularly cheated on his wife with local prostitutes.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=263}} Much of this  happened at the Clayton House Motel. He is also known to have opened a \"club\" in his basement, where he allowed his employees to drink alcohol and play pool. Although Gacy employed teenagers of both sexes at his restaurants, he socialized only with his young male employees. Many were given alcohol before Gacy made sexual advances toward them, which, if rebuffed, he would claim were jokes or a test of morals.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=265}}\n\n====Assault of Donald Voorhees====\nIn August 1967, Gacy committed his first known [[sexual assault]] upon a teenage boy. The victim was 15-year-old Donald Voorhees, the son of a fellow Jaycee. Gacy lured Voorhees to his house with the promise of showing him pornographic films.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=55}} Gacy plied Voorhees with alcohol and persuaded the youth to perform oral sex upon him. Over the following months, several other youths were sexually abused in a similar manner, including one whom Gacy encouraged to have sex with his own wife before [[blackmail]]ing the youth into performing oral sex upon him.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=265}} Gacy tricked several teenagers into believing he was commissioned with conducting homosexual experiments in the interests of \"scientific research\", for which each was paid up to $50.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=266}}\n\nIn March 1968, Voorhees reported to his father that Gacy had sexually assaulted him. Voorhees Sr. immediately informed the police and Gacy was arrested and subsequently charged with oral [[Sodomy law|sodomy]] in relation to Voorhees and the attempted assault of 16-year-old Edward Lynch.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=267}} Gacy vehemently denied the charges and demanded to take a [[polygraph test]]. This request was granted, although the results indicated Gacy was nervous when he denied any wrongdoing in relation to either Voorhees or Lynch.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=65}}\n\nGacy publicly denied any wrongdoing and insisted the charges against him were politically motivated \u2013 Voorhees Sr. had opposed Gacy's nomination for appointment as president of the Iowa Jaycees.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=66}} Several fellow Jaycees found Gacy's story credible and rallied to his support. However, on May 10, 1968, Gacy was indicted on the sodomy charge.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=65}}\n{{quote box\n| quote = ''\"The most striking aspect of the test results is the patient's total denial of responsibility for everything that has happened to him. He can produce an 'alibi' for everything. He presents himself as a victim of circumstances and blames other people who are out to get him ... the patient attempts to assure a sympathetic response by depicting himself as being at the mercy of a hostile environment.\"''\n| source = Section of report detailing Gacy's 1968 psychiatric evaluation.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|pp=270}}\n| width = 30em\n}}\nOn August 30, 1968, Gacy persuaded one of his employees, 18-year-old Russell Schroeder, to [[assault|physically assault]] Voorhees in an effort to discourage the boy from testifying against him at the upcoming trial. Schroeder agreed to lure Voorhees to a secluded spot, spray [[Mace (spray)|Mace]] in his face and beat him. Gacy promised to pay Schroeder $300 if he followed through on the plot. In early September, Schroeder lured Voorhees to an isolated county park, sprayed Mace supplied by Gacy into the youth's eyes, then beat him, all the while shouting that he was not to testify against Gacy at his upcoming trial.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=72}}<ref name=\"Michael H.

The New Evil: Understanding the Emergence of Modern Violent Crime (Amherst, New York: Prometheus Books, 2019), pp. 196-203.</ref>\n\nVoorhees managed to escape, and immediately reported the assault to the police, identifying Schroeder as his attacker. Schroeder was arrested the following day. Despite initially denying any involvement, he soon confessed to having assaulted Voorhees, indicating that he had done so at Gacy's request. Gacy was arrested and additionally charged in relation to hiring Schroeder to assault and [[Witness tampering|intimidate]] Voorhees.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|pp=268\u2013270}}\n\nOn September 12, Gacy was ordered to undergo a [[Psychological evaluation|psychiatric evaluation]] at the Psychiatric Hospital of the State University of Iowa.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|pp=270}} Two doctors had examined Gacy over a period of 17 days before concluding he had an [[antisocial personality disorder]] (a disorder which incorporates constructs such as [[sociopathy]] and [[psychopathy]]),<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/conditions/antisocial-personality-disorder |title=Antisocial Personality Disorder |magazine=[[Psychology Today]]|publisher=Sussex Publishers|location=New York City |date=April 19, 2017 |accessdate=January 13, 2018 }}</ref> was unlikely to benefit from any therapy or medical treatment, and that his behavior pattern was likely to bring him into repeated conflict with society.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|pp=272}} The doctors also concluded he was mentally competent to stand trial.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|pp=272}}\n\n=====Conviction and imprisonment=====\n[[File:John Wayne Gacy (mugshot).jpg|thumb|[[Mug shot]]s of Gacy, following his December 1968 sodomy conviction.]]\nUpon advice from his attorney, Gacy entered a plea of guilty to one count of sodomy in relation to the charges filed against him by Donald Voorhees. He pleaded not guilty to the other charges lodged against him by other youths at a formal [[arraignment]] held on November 7, 1968. Before the judge, Gacy contended that he and Voorhees had indeed engaged in sexual relations, yet he insisted Voorhees had offered his sexual services to him and that he had acted out of curiosity.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|pp=272}} His story was not believed. Despite his lawyers' recommendations for [[probation]],{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=84}} Gacy was convicted of sodomy on December 3, 1968,{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|pp=272}} and sentenced to 10 years at the [[Anamosa State Penitentiary]].{{sfn|Peck|Dolch|2001|p=260}} On the day Gacy was convicted and sentenced, his wife petitioned for [[divorce]],{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=85}} requesting possession of the couple's home, property, sole custody of their two children and subsequent [[alimony]] payments.{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|p=40}} The Court ruled in her favor and the divorce was finalized on September 18, 1969. Gacy never saw his first wife or children again.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=274}}\n\nDuring his incarceration in the Anamosa State Penitentiary, Gacy rapidly acquired a reputation as a model prisoner.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=273}} Within months of his arrival, he had risen to the position of head cook. He also joined the inmate Jaycee chapter and increased their membership figure from 50 to 650 in the span of less than 18 months. He is also known to have both secured an increase in the inmates' daily pay in the prison mess hall{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=88}} and to have supervised several projects to improve conditions for inmates at the prison.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=89}} On one occasion, Gacy oversaw the installation of a [[miniature golf]] course in the prison's recreation yard.<ref>''Serial Killers''. p. 62.</ref>\n\nIn June 1969, Gacy first applied to the State of Iowa Board of Parole for early release: this application was denied. In preparation for a second scheduled parole hearing in May 1970, Gacy completed 16 high school courses, for which he obtained his diploma in November 1969.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=275}}\n\nOn [[Christmas Day]] 1969, Gacy's father died from [[cirrhosis]] of the [[liver]].{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=275}} Gacy was not informed that his father had died until two days after his death.

However, within 24 hours of his release, Gacy relocated to Chicago to live with his mother.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=276}} He arrived in Chicago on June 19 and shortly thereafter obtained a job as a [[short-order cook]] in a restaurant.{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|p=49}}\n\nOn February 12, 1971, Gacy was charged with sexually assaulting a teenage boy.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=95}} The youth claimed that Gacy had lured him into his car at Chicago's [[Greyhound Lines|Greyhound bus]] terminal and driven him to his home, where he had attempted to force the youth into sex. This complaint was subsequently dismissed when the youth failed to appear in court. The Iowa Board of Parole did not learn of this incident (which violated the conditions of his parole) and eight months later, in October 1971, Gacy's parole ended.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=96}} The following month, records of Gacy's previous criminal convictions in Iowa were subsequently [[Record sealing|sealed]].{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|p=53}}{{efn|Gacy successfully hid his [[criminal record]] from friends, business associates and political acquaintances; they only learned the truth of his past after police had begun investigating him for his later murders.{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|p=72}}{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|p=73}}}}\n\n===8213 West Summerdale Avenue===\nWith financial assistance from his mother, Gacy bought a house in Norwood Park Township, an [[unincorporated area]] of [[Cook County, Illinois|Cook County]], a part of metropolitan Chicago. The address, 8213 West Summerdale Avenue, is where he resided until his arrest in December 1978 and where all his known murders were committed.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=175}} He became active in his local community, and his neighbors considered him helpful; willing to loan his construction tools and plowing snow from neighborhood walks free of charge.{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|pp=86\u201387}} Between 1974 and 1978, he hosted annual summer parties attended by hundreds of people, including politicians.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=150}} \n\nIn August 1971, shortly after Gacy and his mother moved into the house, he became engaged to Carole Hoff, a [[divorcee]] with two young daughters. Hoff, whom he had briefly dated in high school, had been a friend of his younger sister. His fianc\u00e9e and stepdaughters moved into his home soon after the couple announced their engagement.{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|pp=55\u201359}} Gacy's mother subsequently moved out of the house shortly before his wedding, which was held on July 1, 1972.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=278}}\n\nOne week before Gacy's wedding, on June 22, he was arrested and charged with aggravated [[Sexual battery|battery]] and reckless conduct. The arrest was in response to a complaint filed by a youth, Jackie Dee, who informed police that Gacy, [[impersonating a police officer]], had flashed a sheriff's badge, lured him into his car, and forced him to perform oral sex.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=112}} These charges were later dropped after the complainant attempted to blackmail Gacy into paying money in exchange for dropping the charges.{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|pp=61\u201362}}\n\n===PDM Contractors===\nIn 1971, Gacy established a part-time construction business, PDM Contractors (PDM being the initials for 'Painting, Decorating, and Maintenance').{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|p=65}} With the approval of his probation officer, he was allowed to work evenings to commit to his employment contracts while working as a cook during the day. The business initially undertook minor repair work, such as sign-writing, pouring concrete, and redecorating, but later expanded to include projects such as interior design, [[remodeling]], installation, assembly, and [[landscaping]]. In mid-1973, Gacy quit his job as a cook in order that he could fully commit to his construction business.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=115}}\n\nMuch of the labor workforce consisted of high school students and young men.{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|p=1}} In 1973, Gacy and a teenage employee of PDM Contractors traveled to [[Florida]] to view property Gacy had purchased. On the first night in Florida, Gacy raped the youth in their hotel room.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=118}} As a result, the youth refused to stay in the same hotel room as Gacy and instead slept on the beach. Upon returning to Chicago, he drove to Gacy's house and beat him in his yard. Gacy's mother-in-law stopped the assault and he drove away. Gacy explained to his wife that the attack happened because he had refused to pay the youth for poor quality painting work.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|pp=117\u2013118}}\n\nAnother employee of Gacy's was 15-year-old Anthony Antonucci, whom he had hired in May 1975. In July 1975, Gacy arrived at Antonucci's home while the youth was alone, having injured his foot at work the day prior. Gacy plied him with alcohol, wrestled him to the floor and cuffed his hands behind his back.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=122-123}} The cuff upon Antonucci's right wrist was loose: Antonucci freed his arm from the [[handcuffs|handcuff]] after Gacy left the room. When Gacy returned, Antonucci\u2014a member of his high school wrestling team\u2014pounced upon him. He wrestled Gacy to the floor, obtained possession of the handcuff key and cuffed Gacy's hands behind his back. Gacy screamed threats, then calmed down and promised to leave if Antonucci removed the handcuffs. The youth agreed and Gacy left the house.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=122-123}} Antonucci later recalled that Gacy had told him as he lay prone on the floor: \"Not only are you the only one who got out of the cuffs; you got them on me.\"{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=123}}\n\nBy 1975, PDM Contractors was expanding rapidly; by his own later admission, he began working 12- and 16-hour days to fulfill agreed commitments upon an increasing number of contracts.

He repeatedly denied that he had anything to do with Piest's disappearance and accused the officers of harassing him because of his political connections or because of his recreational drug use. Knowing these officers were unlikely to arrest him on anything trivial, he openly taunted them by flouting traffic laws and succeeded in losing his pursuers on more than one occasion.{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|p=89}}\n\nOn December 17, investigators conducted a formal interview of Michael Rossi, who informed them Gacy had sold Szyc's vehicle to him with the explanation that he had bought the car from Szyc because the youth needed money to move to California. A further examination of Gacy's Oldsmobile was conducted on this date. In the course of examining the trunk of the car, the investigators discovered a small cluster of fibers which may have been human hair. These fibers were sent for further analysis. That evening, officers conducted a test using three trained [[German shepherd]] [[Search and rescue dog|search dogs]] to determine whether Piest had been present in any of Gacy's vehicles.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=93}} The dogs were allowed to examine each of Gacy's vehicles, whereupon one dog approached Gacy's Oldsmobile and lay upon the passenger seat in what the dog's handler informed investigators was a \"death reaction\", indicating the body of Robert Piest had been present in this vehicle.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=93}}\n\nThat evening, Gacy invited two of the surveillance detectives to a restaurant for a meal. In the early hours of December 18, he invited the same officers into another restaurant where, over breakfast, he talked of his business, his marriages and his activities as a registered clown. At one point during this conversation, Gacy remarked to one of the two surveillance detectives: \"You know\u2026 clowns can get away with murder.\"{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|p=226}}{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=90}}\n\n===Civil suit===\nBy December 18, Gacy was beginning to show visible signs of strain as a result of the constant surveillance: he was unshaven, looked tired, appeared anxious and was drinking heavily. That afternoon, he drove to his lawyers' office to prepare a $750,000 [[civil suit]] against the Des Plaines police,{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=102}} demanding that they cease their surveillance. The same day, the serial number of the Nisson Pharmacy photo receipt found in Gacy's kitchen was traced to 17-year-old Kim Byers, a colleague of Piest at Nisson Pharmacy, who admitted when contacted in person the following day that she had worn the jacket and had placed the receipt in the [[Anorak|parka]] pocket just before she gave the parka to Piest as he left the store to talk with a contractor.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=110}} This revelation contradicted Gacy's previous statements that he had had no contact with Robert Piest on the evening of December 11.{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|pp=116\u2013117}}\n\nThe same evening, Michael Rossi was interviewed a second time: on this occasion, Rossi was more cooperative, informing detectives that in the summer of 1977, Gacy had had him spread ten bags of [[Lime (material)|lime]] in the crawl space of the house.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=143}}\n\nOn December 19, investigators began compiling evidence for a second search warrant of Gacy's house. The same day, Gacy's lawyers filed the civil suit against the Des Plaines police. The hearing of the suit was scheduled for December 22. That afternoon, Gacy invited two of the surveillance detectives inside his house. On this occasion, as one officer distracted Gacy with conversation, another officer walked into Gacy's bedroom in an unsuccessful attempt to write down the serial number of the Motorola TV set they suspected belonged to John Szyc. While flushing Gacy's toilet, this officer noticed a smell he suspected could be that of rotting corpses emanating from a [[heating duct]]; the officers who previously searched Gacy's house had failed to notice this, as on that occasion the house had been cold.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" />\n\nBoth David Cram and Michael Rossi were interviewed by investigators on December 20. Rossi had agreed to be interviewed in relation to his possible links with John Szyc as well as the disappearance of Robert Piest. When questioned by Kozenczak as to where he believed Gacy had placed Piest's body, Rossi replied: \"In the crawl space; he could have put him in the crawl space.\"<ref>Kozenczak (2012), p. 147</ref> A polygraph test showed his responses to questions to be inconclusive; however, upon his agreeing to a subsequent visual test in which a map of Cook County was divided into 12 [[Grid plan|grid sections]] numbered 1 to 12, with Gacy's home marked in the fourth grid section, Kozenczak noted an extreme response in Rossi's [[blood pressure]] when asked: \"Is the body of Robert Piest buried in grid number 4?\"<ref>Kozenczak, Joseph R.; Kozenczak, Karen M.

Cram then stated Gacy had grabbed a flashlight and immediately entered the crawl space to look for evidence of digging. When asked whether he had been to the crawl space, Cram replied he had been asked by Gacy to spread lime down there and also dug trenches upon Gacy's behest with the explanation they were for plumbing.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=143}} Cram stated these trenches were {{convert|2|ft|m|sp=us}} wide, {{convert|6|ft|m|sp=us}} long and {{convert|2|ft|m|sp=us}} deep\u2014the size of graves.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|pp=143\u2013145}}\n\n===Verbal confession===\nOn the evening of December 20, Gacy drove to his lawyers' office in [[Park Ridge, Illinois|Park Ridge]] to attend a pre-scheduled meeting he had arranged with them, ostensibly to discuss the progress of his civil suit. Upon his arrival, Gacy appeared disheveled and immediately asked for an alcoholic drink, whereupon Sam Amirante fetched a bottle of whiskey from his car. Upon his return, Amirante asked Gacy what he had to discuss with them. Gacy picked up a copy of the ''[[Chicago Daily Herald|Daily Herald]]'' from Amirante's desk; he pointed to a front-page article covering the disappearance of Robert Piest and informed his lawyers: \"This boy is dead. He's in a river.\"{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|p=136}}\n\nOver the following hours, Gacy gave a rambling confession that ran into the early hours of the following morning. He began by informing Amirante and Stevens he had \"been the judge ... jury and executioner of many, many people\",<ref>Amirante & Broderick 2011, p. 127</ref> most of whom he stated were buried in his crawl space, and others in the Des Plaines River. Some victims he referred to by name; most he dismissed as \"[[Male prostitution|male prostitutes]]\", \"hustlers\" and \"liars\" to whom he gave \"the rope trick\". On other occasions, he stated he woke up to find \"dead, strangled kids\" on his floor, with their hands cuffed behind their back.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=171}} In reference to Robert Piest, Gacy stated that as he placed the tourniquet around his neck, that Piest was \"crying, scared\".<ref>Amirante & Broderick 2011, p. 140</ref>\n\nAs a result of the alcohol he had consumed, Gacy fell asleep midway through his confession and Amirante immediately arranged a psychiatric appointment for Gacy at 9 a.m. that morning. Upon awakening several hours later, Gacy simply shook his head when informed by Amirante he had earlier confessed to killing approximately 30 people, stating: \"Well, I can't think about this right now. I've got things to do.\"<ref name=\"Amirante & Broderick 2011, p. 150\">Amirante & Broderick 2011, p. 150</ref> Ignoring his lawyers' advice regarding his scheduled appointment, Gacy left their office to attend to the needs of his business.<ref name=\"Amirante & Broderick 2011, p. 150\" />\n\nGacy later recollected his memories of his final day of freedom as being \"hazy\", adding that he knew his arrest was inevitable and that, in his final hours of freedom, he intended to visit his friends and say his final farewells.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|pp=255\u2013258}} Upon leaving his lawyers' office, Gacy drove to a Shell gas station where, in the course of filling his rental car, he handed a small bag of [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] to the attendant, Lance Jacobson. Jacobson immediately handed the bag to the surveillance officers, adding that Gacy had told him: \"The end is coming (for me). These guys are going to kill me.\" Gacy then drove to the home of a fellow contractor, Ronald Rhode. Inside Rhode's living room, Gacy hugged Rhode before bursting into tears and saying: \"I killed thirty people, give or take a few.\" Gacy then left Rhode's home to meet with Michael Rossi and David Cram. As he drove along the expressway, the surveillance officers noted he was holding a [[Catholic rosary|rosary]] to his chin as he prayed while driving.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=152}}\n\nAfter talking with Cram and Rossi at Cram's home, Gacy had Cram drive him to a scheduled meeting with Leroy Stevens. As he spoke with his lawyer, Cram informed the officers that Gacy had earlier divulged to both himself and Rossi that the previous evening, he had confessed to his lawyers his guilt in over thirty murders. Upon concluding his meeting with his lawyer, Gacy had Cram drive him to Maryhill Cemetery, where his father was buried.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=259}}\n\nAs Gacy drove to various locations that morning, police outlined their formal draft of their second search warrant. The purpose of the warrant was specifically to search for the body of Robert Piest in the crawl space. Upon hearing radioed reports from the surveillance detectives that, in light of his erratic behavior, Gacy might be about to commit suicide, police decided to arrest him upon a charge of possession and distribution of marijuana{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=157}} in order to hold him in custody as the formal request for a second search warrant was presented. At 4:30 on the afternoon of December 21, the eve of the hearing of Gacy's civil suit, the request for a second search warrant was granted by Judge Marvin J. Peters.<ref>Kozenczak, (2012) p. 158</ref>\n\nArmed with the signed search warrant, police and evidence technicians quickly drove to Gacy's home. Upon their arrival, officers found that Gacy had unplugged his [[sump pump]] and that the crawl space was flooded with water; to clear the water they simply replaced the plug and waited for the water to drain. After it had done so, evidence technician Daniel Genty entered the {{convert|28|x|38|ft|adj=on}} crawl space,<ref>''Serial Killers''. p. 50.</ref> crawled to the southwest area, and began digging. Within minutes, he had uncovered [[putrefaction|putrefied]] flesh and a human arm bone. Genty immediately shouted to the investigators that they could charge Gacy with murder.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=167}} Genty added the remark: \"I think this place is full of kids.\"{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=167}}\n\n==Arrest and confession==\n[[File:Gacycrawlspace.png|thumb|260px|Gacy's diagram of the burial locations of his victims within his basement and the investigators' subsequent diagram of the crawl space.]]After being informed that the police had found human remains in his crawl space and that he would now face murder charges, Gacy told officers he wanted to \"clear the air\",{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=171}} adding that he knew his arrest was inevitable since he had spent the previous evening on the couch in his lawyers' office.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=170}}\n\nIn the early hours of December 22, 1978, Gacy confessed to police that since 1972, he had committed 25 to 30 murders, all of whom he falsely claimed were of teenage male [[Runaway (dependent)|runaway]]s or male prostitutes.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=174}} When asked where he drew the inspiration for the two-by-four attached with manacles at either end found at his house, Gacy stated he had been inspired to construct the device from reading about the [[Dean Corll|Houston Mass Murders]].{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=197}}{{efn|The Houston Mass Murders were a series of killings uncovered in 1973 in which Dean Corll, with two teenaged accomplices, had also used a wooden device (in their case a board fitted with handcuffs at each corner) to restrain their male victims throughout their sexual abuse and torture.<ref>{{Cite book|title = The Man with the Candy: The Story of the Houston Mass Murders|last = Olsen|first = Jack|publisher = Simon and Schuster|year = 2008|isbn = 978-1-439-12870-1 |page = 146}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title = How to Make a Serial Killer: The Twisted Development of Innocent Children Into the World's Most Sadistic Murderers|last = Berry-Dee|first = Christopher|publisher = Ulysses Press|year = 2008|isbn = 978-1-569-75943-1|location = |page = 202}}</ref> Gacy was likely inspired by press coverage relating to the Houston Mass Murders to construct this device to restrain his victims, and to dupe his victim into donning handcuffs, as several victims of the Houston Mass Murders had been.{{sfn|Berry-Dee|2009|p=138}}}} In January 1979, he had planned to further conceal the corpses by covering the entire crawl space with concrete.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=222}} \n\nWhen specifically questioned about Piest, Gacy confessed to strangling him at his house on the evening of December 11 after luring him there.

In response to questioning relating to whether Gacy appreciated the criminality of his actions, Rignall stated his belief that Gacy was unable to conform his actions to the conduct of law because of the \"beastly and animalistic ways he attacked me\".<ref>Amirante & Broderick 2011, p. 290</ref> Upon specific cross-examination relating to the torture he had endured, Rignall vomited before he was excused from further testimony.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=300}}\n\nOn February 29, Donald Voorhees, whom Gacy had sexually assaulted in 1967, testified to his ordeal at Gacy's hands, and that Gacy had subsequently paid another youth to beat him and spray Mace in his face so he would not testify against him.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=340}} Voorhees felt unable to testify, but did briefly attempt to do so, before being asked to step down.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=340}}\n\nRobert Donnelly testified the week after Voorhees, recounting his ordeal at Gacy's hands in December 1977. Donnelly was visibly distressed as he recollected the abuse he endured at Gacy's hands and came close to breaking down on several occasions. As Donnelly testified, Gacy repeatedly laughed at him,{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=333}} but Donnelly finished his testimony. One of Gacy's defense attorneys, Robert Motta, during Donnelly's cross-examination, attempted to discredit his testimony, but Donnelly did not waver from his testimony of what had occurred.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=345}}\n\nDuring the fifth week of the trial, Gacy wrote a personal letter to Judge Garippo requesting a [[mistrial]]{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=342}} on a number of bases, including that he did not approve his lawyers' insanity plea approach; that his lawyers had not allowed him to take the witness stand (as he had desired to do); that his defense had not called enough witnesses, and that the police were lying about statements he had purportedly made to detectives after his arrest and that, in any event, the statements were \"self-serving\" for use by the prosecution.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|pp=350\u2013351}} Judge Garippo addressed Gacy's letter by informing him that under the law he had the choice as to whether he wished to testify, and he was free to indicate as much to the judge if he wished to do so.{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|p=312}}\n\n===Closing arguments===\nOn March 11, final arguments from both prosecution and defense attorneys began, with the arguments concluding on the following day. Prosecuting attorney Terry Sullivan argued first, outlining Gacy's history of abusing youths, the testimony of his efforts to avoid detection and describing Gacy's surviving victims\u2014Voorhees and Donnelly\u2014as \"living dead\".{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=361}} Referring to Gacy as the \"worst of all murderers\",<ref>Amirante & Broderick 2011, p. 324</ref> Sullivan stated: \"John Gacy has accounted for more human devastation than many earthly catastrophes, but one must tremble. I tremble when thinking about just how close he came to getting away with it all.\"{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=361}}\n\nAfter the state's four-hour closing, counsel Sam Amirante argued for the defense. Amirante argued against the testimony delivered by the doctors who had testified for the prosecution, repeatedly citing the testimony of the four psychiatrists and psychologists who had testified on behalf of the defense.{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|p=360}} Amirante also accused Sullivan of scarcely referring to the evidence presented throughout the trial in his own closing argument, and of arousing hatred against his client. The defense lawyer attempted to portray Gacy as a \"man driven by compulsions he was unable to control\".{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=363}}\n\nIn support of these arguments, the defense counsel repeatedly referred to the testimony of the doctors who had appeared for the defense, in addition to the testimony of defense witnesses such as Jeffrey Rignall and Gacy's former business associate Mickel Reed\u2014both of whom had testified to their belief that Gacy had been unable to control his actions.{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|p=359}} Amirante then urged the jury to put aside any prejudice they held against his client, and requested they deliver a verdict of not guilty by reason of insanity, adding that the psychology of Gacy's behavior would be of benefit to scientific research and that the psychology of his mind should be studied.{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|p=361}}\n\n[[File:Kunkletrial.jpg|200px|thumb|William Kunkle, prosecutor at Gacy's trial, standing before a board depicting the 22 victims identified by February 1980.]]\nOn the morning of March 12,{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|p=364}} William Kunkle continued to argue for the prosecution. Kunkle referred to the defense's contention of insanity as \"a [[falsity|sham]]\", arguing that the facts of the case demonstrated Gacy's ability to think logically and control his actions. Kunkle also referred to the testimony of a doctor who had examined Gacy in 1968. This doctor had diagnosed Gacy as an [[antisocial personality]], capable of committing crimes without remorse. Kunkle indicated that had the recommendations of this doctor been heeded, Gacy would have not been freed.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=368}}\n\nAt the close of his argument, Kunkle pulled each of the 22 photos of Gacy's identified victims off a board displaying the images and asked the jury not to show sympathy but to \"show justice\". Kunkle then asked the jury to \"show the same sympathy this man showed when he took these lives and put them ''there!''{{-\"}}{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=368}} before throwing the stack of photos into the opening of the trap door of Gacy's crawl space, which had been introduced as evidence and was on display in the courtroom.

The following year, Gacy filed a further post-conviction petition, seeking a new trial. His then-defense lawyer, [[Richard Kling]], argued that Gacy had been provided with ineffective legal counsel at his 1980 trial.

Amirante has since stated that the primary inspiration for this legislation was the fact that at the time of the Gacy murders, there had been a 72-hour period which police in Illinois had to allow to elapse before initiating a search for a missing child or adolescent.{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|page= 395}}\n\nThe Illinois Missing Child Recovery Act of 1984 removed this 72-hour waiting period. Other states across America subsequently adopted similar procedures and sensibilities, as a result of which a national network aimed at locating missing children was gradually formed. This national network has since developed into the Child Abduction Emergency\u2014commonly known today as an [[Amber Alert]].{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|page= 395}}\n\n==Potential accomplices and connections==\nOne of the first things Gacy told investigators after his arrest was that he had not acted alone in several of the murders: he asked whether \"my associates\" had also been arrested.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=171}} When questioned as to whether these associates had participated directly or indirectly in the killings, Gacy replied, \"Directly.\"{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=171}}\n\nGacy specifically named Cram and Rossi as being involved in several of the murders.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=171}} In the 1980s, he also informed [[Robert Ressler]] that \"two or three\" PDM employees had assisted him in several murders.<ref>Whoever Fights Monsters {{ISBN|0-671-71561-5}} pp 341\u2013342</ref> Ressler replied that he believed there were unexplained avenues to the case and stated his belief that Gacy had killed more than 33 victims.

The Italian chronicler Gabriele de\u2019 Mussi, in his ''Istoria de Morbo sive Mortalitate quae fuit Anno Domini 1348'', describes quite plausibly how the plague was transmitted by the Mongols by throwing diseased cadavers with catapults into the besieged city, and how ships transporting Genovese soldiers, fleas and rats fleeing from there brought it to the Mediterranean ports. Given the highly complex epidemiology of plague, this interpretation of the Black Death (which might have killed >25 million people in the following years throughout Europe) as stemming from a specific and localized origin of the Black Death remains controversial.

This blockage starves the fleas and drives them to aggressive feeding behaviour and attempts to clear the blockage by [[vomiting|regurgitation]], resulting in thousands of plague bacteria being flushed into the feeding site, infecting the host. The bubonic plague mechanism was also dependent on two populations of rodents: one resistant to the disease, which act as [[Host (biology)|hosts]], keeping the disease [[Endemic (epidemiology)|endemic]], and a second that lack resistance. When the second population dies, the fleas move on to other hosts, including people, thus creating a human [[Epidemic typhus|epidemic]].<ref name=Chritakos2005/>\n\nThe historian [[Francis Aidan Gasquet]] wrote about the Great Pestilence in 1893{{sfn|Gasquet|1893}} and suggested that \"it would appear to be some form of the ordinary Eastern or bubonic plague\".

The Black Death was a pandemic that affected all of Europe in the ways described, not only Italy. The Renaissance's emergence in Italy was most likely the result of the complex interaction of the above factors,<ref name=\"brotton\">Brotton, J., ''The Renaissance: A Very Short Introduction'', Oxford University Press, 2006 {{ISBN|0-19-280163-5}}.</ref> in combination with an [[Greek scholars in the Renaissance#Contribution of Greek scholars to the Italian Renaissance|influx of Greek scholars]] following the [[Fall of Constantinople#Impact on the Renaissance|fall of the Byzantine Empire]]{{Citation needed|2020|date=March 2020}}.\n[[File:The Triumph of Death P001393.jpg|thumb|[[Pieter Brueghel the Elder|Pieter Bruegel]]'s ''[[The Triumph of Death]]'' reflects the social upheaval and terror that followed plague, which devastated medieval Europe.]]\nThe plague was carried by fleas on sailing vessels returning from the ports of Asia, spreading quickly due to lack of proper sanitation: the population of [[England in the Late Middle Ages|England]], then about 4.2 million, lost 1.4 million people to the bubonic plague. Florence's population was nearly halved in the year 1347. As a result of the decimation in the populace the value of the working class increased, and commoners came to enjoy more freedom. To answer the increased need for labor, workers traveled in search of the most favorable position economically.<ref>Netzley, Patricia D. ''Life During the Renaissance.''San Diego: Lucent Books, Inc., 1998.</ref>\n\nThe demographic decline due to the plague had economic consequences: the prices of food dropped and land values declined by 30\u201340% in most parts of Europe between 1350 and 1400.<ref>Hause, S. & Maltby, W. (2001). ''A History of European Society. Essentials of Western Civilization'' (Vol. 2, p. 217). Belmont, CA: Thomson Learning, Inc.</ref> Landholders faced a great loss, but for ordinary men and women it was a windfall. The survivors of the plague found not only that the prices of food were cheaper but also that lands were more abundant, and many of them inherited property from their dead relatives, and this probably destabilized [[feudalism]].\n\nThe spread of disease was significantly more rampant in areas of poverty. [[Epidemic]]s ravaged cities, particularly children. Plagues were easily spread by lice, unsanitary drinking water, armies, or by poor sanitation. Children were hit the hardest because many diseases, such as typhus and congenital syphilis, target the immune system, leaving young children without a fighting chance. Children in city dwellings were more affected by the spread of disease than the children of the wealthy.<ref>\"Renaissance And Reformation France\" Mack P. Holt pp. 30, 39, 69, 166</ref>\n\nItalian chronicler [[Agnolo di Tura]] recorded his experience from [[Siena]]:\n{{quote|Father abandoned child, wife husband, one brother another; for this illness seemed to strike through the breath and sight. And so they died. And none could be found to bury the dead for money or friendship. Members of a household brought their dead to a ditch as best they could, without priest, without divine offices ... great pits were dug and piled deep with the multitude of dead. And they died by the hundreds both day and night ... And as soon as those ditches were filled more were dug ... And I, Agnolo di Tura ... buried my five children with my own hands. And there were also those who were so sparsely covered with earth that the dogs dragged them forth and devoured many bodies throughout the city. There was no one who wept for any death, for all awaited death.

Despite a significant number of deaths among members of the ruling classes, the government of Florence continued to function during this period.

In 1346, the attacking army experienced an epidemic of bubonic plague. The Italian chronicler Gabriele de\u2019 Mussi, in his ''Istoria de Morbo sive Mortalitate quae fuit Anno Domini 1348'', describes quite plausibly how the plague was transmitted by the Mongols by throwing diseased cadavers with catapults into the besieged city, and how ships transporting Genovese soldiers, fleas and rats fleeing from there brought it to the Mediterranean ports. Given the highly complex epidemiology of plague, this interpretation of the Black Death (which might have killed >25 million people in the following years throughout Europe) as stemming from a specific and localized origin of the Black Death remains controversial. Similarly, it remains doubtful whether the effect of throwing infected cadavers could have been the sole cause of the outburst of an epidemic in the besieged city.}}</ref> During a protracted siege of the city by the Mongol army under [[Jani Beg]], whose army was suffering from the disease, the army [[Biological warfare|catapulted infected corpses]] over the [[defensive wall|city walls]] of Kaffa to infect the inhabitants.

That the plague was caused by bad air became the most widely accepted theory at the time, the [[miasma theory]]. The word ''plague'' did not at first refer to a specific illness, and only the recurrence of outbreaks during the Middle Ages gave it the meaning which persists in modern medicine.\n\nThe importance of [[hygiene]] was recognised only in the nineteenth century; until then streets were commonly filthy, with live animals of all sorts around and human parasites abounding, facilitating the spread of [[Transmission (medicine)|transmissible disease]]. One early medical advance as a result of the Black Death was the establishment of the idea of [[quarantine]] in the city-state of [[Republic of Ragusa|Ragusa]] (modern [[Dubrovnik]], Croatia) in 1377 after continuing outbreaks.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Sehdev PS | title = The Origin of Quarantine | journal = Clinical Infectious Diseases | volume = 35 | issue = 9 | pages = 1071\u201372 | year = 2002 | pmid = 12398064 | doi = 10.1086/344062 | url = http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/35/9/1071.full | access-date = 4 June 2012 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120628005447/http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/35/9/1071.full | archive-date = 28 June 2012 | url-status = live }}</ref>\n\nToday, the dominant explanation for the Black Death is the ''plague theory'', which attributes the outbreak to ''Yersinia pestis'', also responsible for an epidemic that began in southern China in 1865, eventually spreading to India.

This blockage starves the fleas and drives them to aggressive feeding behaviour and attempts to clear the blockage by [[vomiting|regurgitation]], resulting in thousands of plague bacteria being flushed into the feeding site, infecting the host. The bubonic plague mechanism was also dependent on two populations of rodents: one resistant to the disease, which act as [[Host (biology)|hosts]], keeping the disease [[Endemic (epidemiology)|endemic]], and a second that lack resistance. When the second population dies, the fleas move on to other hosts, including people, thus creating a human [[Epidemic typhus|epidemic]].<ref name=Chritakos2005/>\n\nThe historian [[Francis Aidan Gasquet]] wrote about the Great Pestilence in 1893{{sfn|Gasquet|1893}} and suggested that \"it would appear to be some form of the ordinary Eastern or bubonic plague\".

Florence's population was nearly halved in the year 1347. As a result of the decimation in the populace the value of the working class increased, and commoners came to enjoy more freedom.

He read [[Literae Humaniores|Classics]] at [[Balliol College, Oxford]], where he was elected [[President of the Oxford Union]] in 1986. He began his career in journalism at ''[[The Times]]'' newspaper, from which he was dismissed for falsifying a quotation. He later became the Brussels correspondent for ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' newspaper, where his articles exerted a strong influence on growing [[Eurosceptic]] sentiment on the British right. He was promoted to be an assistant editor from 1994 to 1999, and edited ''[[The Spectator]]'' magazine from 1999 to 2005.\n\nHe was elected MP for Henley in 2001, and served as a [[Shadow Cabinet|Junior Shadow Minister]] under Conservative leaders [[Michael Howard]] and [[David Cameron]].

He [[resigned from the British House of Commons|resigned as an MP]] and in [[2008 London mayoral election|2008]] was elected Mayor of London, being re-elected in [[2012 London mayoral election|2012]].

June 1964) is a British politician, writer, and former journalist serving as [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]] and [[Leader of the Conservative Party (UK)|Leader of the Conservative Party]] since 2019. He was [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Foreign Secretary]] from 2016 to 2018 and [[Mayor of London]] from [[2008 London mayoral election|2008]] to 2016. Johnson was [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|Member of Parliament]] for [[Henley (UK Parliament constituency)|Henley]] from [[2001 United Kingdom general election|2001]] to [[2008 Henley by-election|2008]] and has been MP for [[Uxbridge and South Ruislip (UK Parliament constituency)|Uxbridge and South Ruislip]] since [[2015 United Kingdom general election|2015]]. Ideologically, Johnson identifies as a [[one-nation conservative]].\n\n<!--Early life, journalism, and early political career-->\nJohnson was born in New York City to upper-middle-class [[English people|English]] parents and educated at [[Eton College]]. He read [[Literae Humaniores|Classics]] at [[Balliol College, Oxford]], where he was elected [[President of the Oxford Union]] in 1986. He began his career in journalism at ''[[The Times]]'' newspaper, from which he was dismissed for falsifying a quotation. He later became the Brussels correspondent for ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' newspaper, where his articles exerted a strong influence on growing [[Eurosceptic]] sentiment on the British right. He was promoted to be an assistant editor from 1994 to 1999, and edited ''[[The Spectator]]'' magazine from 1999 to 2005.\n\nHe was elected MP for Henley in 2001, and served as a [[Shadow Cabinet|Junior Shadow Minister]] under Conservative leaders [[Michael Howard]] and [[David Cameron]]. He largely adhered to the Conservatives' [[party line (politics)|party line]] but adopted a [[Cultural liberalism|socially liberal]] stance on issues such as [[LGBT rights in the United Kingdom|LGBT rights]] in parliamentary votes. He [[resigned from the British House of Commons|resigned as an MP]] and in [[2008 London mayoral election|2008]] was elected Mayor of London, being re-elected in [[2012 London mayoral election|2012]]. During his mayoralty he oversaw the [[2012 Summer Olympics]], introduced the [[New Routemaster]] buses, a [[Santander Cycles|cycle hire scheme]] and a [[Emirates Air Line (cable car)|cable car crossing the Thames]], and banned alcohol consumption on much of London's public transport.\n\n<!--Post-Mayoral career-->\nIn 2015, Johnson was [[2015 United Kingdom general election|elected]] MP for Uxbridge and South Ruislip, stepping down as mayor the following year. In 2016, he became a prominent figure in the successful [[Vote Leave]] campaign for [[Brexit]]. He then served as [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs]] during the earlier stages of [[Theresa May]]'s premiership; [[List of departures from the second May ministry|he resigned from the post]] two years later, in criticism of May's approach to Brexit and the [[Chequers Agreement]]. After May resigned in 2019, he was [[2019 Conservative Party leadership election|elected]] Conservative leader and appointed prime minister. His [[2019 British prorogation controversy|September 2019 prorogation of]] [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] was ruled unlawful by the [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom|Supreme Court]].<ref name=\"prorogationtechnicality\">Formally, Parliament is prorogued by Her Majesty the Queen on the advice of the Prime Minister; it is a common [[legal fiction]] in the UK that many executive functions of the Prime Minister are formally carried out by the Queen on the Prime Minister's \"advice\", which is effectively the legal instrument by which the Prime Minister carries out the function. It was this advice of Johnson's that was ruled unlawful, not the actions of Her Majesty.</ref> In the [[2019 United Kingdom general election|2019 general election]], Johnson led the Conservative Party to its biggest victory since 1987, with the biggest percentage vote share of any party since 1979. The United Kingdom [[Withdrawal from the European Union|withdrew from the European Union]] under the terms of a revised [[Brexit withdrawal agreement]]. Johnson tested positive for [[Coronavirus disease 2019|COVID-19]] in March 2020, and on 6 April, he was admitted to intensive care.<!--Please be careful when updating the above, only update with very significant updates. Avoid WP:RECENTISM-->\n\n<!--Reception, legacy, and influence-->\nJohnson is a controversial figure in British politics and journalism. Supporters have praised him as an entertaining, humorous, and popular figure, with an appeal stretching beyond traditional Conservative voters and [[Eurosceptics]]. Conversely, his critics have accused him of dishonesty, [[elitism]], and [[cronyism]], and of using offensive language.

The first federal policy of [[race-conscious]] affirmative action was the [[Revised Philadelphia Plan]], implemented in 1969, which required certain government contractors to set \"goals and timetables\" for integrating and diversifying their workforce. Similar policies emerged through a mix of voluntary practices and federal and state policies in employment and education. Affirmative action as a practice was partially upheld by the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] in ''[[Grutter v. Bollinger]] ''(2003), while the use of racial quotas for college admissions was concurrently ruled unconstitutional by the Court in ''[[Gratz v. Bollinger]]'' (2003).\n\nAffirmative action is  likely to give rise to controversy in American politics. Supporters argue that affirmative action is still needed to counteract continuing bias and prejudice against women and minorities. Opponents argue that these policies amount to discrimination against non-minorities which entails favoring one group over another based upon racial preference rather than achievement, and many believe that the diversity of current American society suggests that affirmative action policies succeeded and are no longer required.<ref>{{Cite news\n |title = Affirmative Action\n |date = June 15, 2009\n |url = http://topics.nytimes.com/topics/reference/timestopics/subjects/a/affirmative_action/index.html\n |accessdate = May 5, 2010\n| newspaper=The New York Times\n| first=Ross\n| last=Douthat| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100521064855/http://topics.nytimes.com/topics/reference/timestopics/subjects/a/affirmative_action/index.html| archivedate= May 21, 2010 | url-status= live}}\n</ref> Supporters point to contemporary examples of conscious and unconscious biases, such as the finding that job-seekers with black-sounding names are 50% less likely to get a callback than those with white-sounding names, as proof that affirmative action is not obsolete.<ref name=\":17\" />\n\n==History==\n===Origins===\nThe policy now called affirmative action came as early as the [[Reconstruction era|Reconstruction Era]] (1863\u20131877) in which a [[Freedman|former slave]] population lacked the skills and resources for independent living.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal | last = Fran\u00e7ois | first = Anderson Bellegarde | title = The brand of inferiority: the civil rights act of 1875, white supremacy, and affirmative action | journal = [[Howard University School of Law#Publications|Howard Law Journal]] | volume = 57 | issue = 2 | pages = 573\u201399 | date = Winter 2014 | url = http://iibp.chadwyck.com/toc/00186813/572Winter2014.htm | ref = harv }} [http://www.law.howard.edu/dictator/media/229/how_57_2.pdf Pdf.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150806223050/http://www.law.howard.edu/dictator/media/229/how_57_2.pdf |date=August 6, 2015 }}</ref> In 1865, General [[William Tecumseh Sherman]] proposed, for practical reasons, to divide the land and goods from [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] and grant it to black families, which became the \"[[Forty acres and a mule]]\" policy.<ref name=\":2\" /> The proposal was never widely adopted due to strong political opposition, and Sherman's orders were soon revoked by President Andrew Johnson.

Truman]]\n\nFollowing the Sergeant [[Isaac Woodard]] incident, President [[Harry S. Truman]], himself a combat veteran of [[World War I]], issued [[Executive Order 9808]]<ref name=Exec_9980>{{cite web|url=http://www.trumanlibrary.org/executiveorders/index.php?pid=29&st=&st1= |title=Executive Orders Harry S.

Hearing of the incident, Truman turned to [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People|NAACP]] leader [[Walter Francis White]] and declared, \"My God! I had no idea it was as terrible as that. We've got to do something.\" In 1947 the committee published its findings, [[To Secure These Rights]]. The book was widely read, influential, and considered utopian for the times: \"In our land men are equal, but they are free to be different. From these very differences among our people has come the great human and national strength of America.\" The report discussed and demonstrated racial discrimination in basic freedoms, education, public facilities, personal safety, and employment opportunities. The committee was disturbed by the state of race relations, and included the [[Internment of Japanese Americans|evacuation of Americans of Japanese descent]] during the war \"made without a trial or any sort of hearing\u2026Fundamental to our whole system of law is the belief that guilt is personal and not a matter of heredity or association.\" The recommendations were radical, calling for federal policies and laws to end racial discrimination and bring about equality: \"We can tolerate no restrictions upon the individual which depend upon irrelevant factors such as his race, his color, his religion, or the social position to which he is born.\" To Secure These Rights set the liberal legislative agenda for the next generation that eventually would be signed into law by [[Lyndon B. Johnson]].<ref name=Anderson2004/>{{rp|35\u201336}}\n\nTo Secure These Rights also called for [[desegregation]] of the [[United States Armed Forces|Armed Forces]]. \"Prejudice in any area is an ugly, undemocratic phenomenon, but in the armed services, where all men run the risk of death, it is especially repugnant.\" The rationale was fairness: \"When an individual enters the service of the country, he necessarily surrenders some of the rights and privileges which are inherent in American citizenship.\" In return, the government \"undertakes to protect his integrity as an individual.\" Yet that was not possible in the segregated Army, since \"any discrimination which\u2026prevents members of the minority groups from rendering full military service in defense of their country is for them a humiliating badge of inferiority.\" The report called for an end to \"all discrimination and segregation based on race, color, creed, or national origins in\u2026all branches of the Armed Services.\"<ref name=Anderson2004/>{{rp|38\u201339}}\n\nIn 1947 Truman and his advisors came up with a plan for a large standing military, called Universal Military Training, and presented it to Congress.

It consisted of ten objectives that Congress should focus on when enacting legislation. Truman concluded by saying, \"If we wish to inspire the peoples of the world whose freedom is in jeopardy, if we wish to restore hope to those who have already lost their civil liberties, if we wish to fulfill the promise that is ours, we must correct the remaining imperfections in our practice of democracy.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.trumanlibrary.org/publicpapers/index.php?pid=1380&st=&st1= |title=Special message to the Congress on civil rights |author=Harry S.

His speech was a significant departure from traditional race relations in the United States. In front of 10,000 people at the [[Lincoln Memorial]], the president left no doubt where he stood on civil rights. According to his speech, America had \"reached a turning point in the long history of our country's efforts to guarantee freedom and equality to all our citizens\u2026Each man must be guaranteed equality of opportunity.\" He proposed what black citizens had been calling for \u2013 an enhanced role of federal authority through the states. \"We must make the Federal government a friendly, vigilant defender of the rights and equalities of all [[Americans]].

The order created the position of Fair Employment Officer. The order \"established in the Civil Service Commission a Fair Employment Board of not less than seven persons.\"<ref name=Exec_9980/> Executive Order 9981, named Establishing the President's Committee on Equality of Treatment and Opportunity in the Armed Services, called for the integration of the Armed Forces and the creation of the [[National Military Establishment]] to carry out the executive order.<ref name=Exec_9981>{{cite web|url=http://www.trumanlibrary.org/executiveorders/index.php?pid=869&st=&st1= |title=Executive Orders Harry S.

Kennedy]]\n\nIn the [[1960 United States presidential election|1960 presidential election]], [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] candidate and eventual winner [[John F. Kennedy]] \"criticized President Eisenhower for not ending discrimination in federally supported housing\" and \"advocated a permanent [[Fair Employment Practices Commission]]\".<ref name=Anderson2004/>{{rp|59}} Shortly after taking office, Kennedy issued [[Executive Order 10925]] in March 1961, requiring government contractors to \"consider and recommend additional affirmative steps which should be taken by executive departments and agencies to realize more fully the national policy of nondiscrimination\u2026. The contractor will take affirmative action to ensure that applicants are employed, and that employees are treated during employment, without regard to their race, creed, color, or national origin\".<ref name=Anderson2004/>{{rp|60}} The order also established the [[Equal Employment Opportunity Commission|President's Committee on Equal Employment Opportunity]] (PCEEO), chaired by Vice President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]]. Federal contractors who failed to comply or violated the executive order were punished by contract cancellation and the possible debarment from future government contracts. The administration was \"not demanding any special preference or treatment or quotas for minorities\" but was rather \"advocating racially neutral hiring to end job discrimination\".<ref name=Anderson2004/>{{rp|61}} Turning to issues of [[women's rights]], Kennedy initiated a [[Presidential Commission on the Status of Women|Commission on the Status of Women]] in December 1961. The commission was charged with \"examining employment policies and practices of the government and of contractors\" with regard to sex.<ref name=Anderson2004/>{{rp|66}}\n\nIn June 1963, President Kennedy continued his policy of affirmative action by issuing another mandate, [[Executive Order 11114]]. The order supplemented to his previous 1961 executive order declaring it was the \"policy of the United States to encourage by affirmative action the elimination of discrimination in employment\".<ref name=Anderson2004/>{{rp|72}} Through this order, all federal funds, such as \"grants, loans, unions and employers who accepted taxpayer funds, and other forms of financial assistance to state and local governments,\" were forced to comply to the government's policies on affirmative action in employment practices.<ref name=Anderson2004/>{{rp|72}}\n\n===Johnson administration (1963-1969)===\n[[Lyndon B. Johnson]], the Texan Democrat and [[Party leaders of the United States Senate|Senate Majority Leader]] from 1955\u20131961, began to consider running for high office, and in doing so showed how his racial views differed from those held by many [[White American]]s in the traditional [[Southern United States|South]]. In 1957, Johnson brokered a civil rights act through Congress. The bill established a Civil Rights Division and Commission in the [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]]. The commission was empowered to investigate allegations of minority deprivation of rights.<ref name=Anderson2004/>{{rp|57}}\n\nThe first time \"affirmative action\" is used by the federal government concerning race is in President John F. Kennedy's Executive Order 10925, which was chaired by Vice President Johnson. At Johnson's inaugural ball in Texas, he met with a young black lawyer, [[Hobart Taylor, Jr.]], and gave him the task to co-author the executive order. \"Affirmative action\" was chosen due to its [[Alliteration|alliterative]] quality. The term \"active recruitment\" started to be used as well. This order, albeit heavily worked up as a significant piece of legislation, in reality carried little actual power. The scope was limited to a couple hundred defense contractors, leaving nearly $7.5 billion in federal grants and loans unsupervised.<ref name=Anderson2004/>{{rp|60}}\n\n[[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People|NAACP]] had many problem's with JFK's \"token\" proposal. They wanted jobs. One day after the order took effect, NAACP labor secretary [[Herbert Hill (labor director)|Herbert Hill]] filed complaints against the hiring and promoting practices of [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed Aircraft Corporation]]. Lockheed was doing business with the [[United States Department of Defense|Defense Department]] on the first billion-dollar contract. Due to taxpayer-funding being 90% of Lockheed's business, along with disproportionate hiring practices, black workers charged Lockheed with \"overt discrimination.\" Lockheed signed an agreement with Vice President Johnson that pledged an \"aggressive seeking out for more qualified minority candidates for technical and skill positions.<ref name=Anderson2004/>{{rp|63\u201364}}\nThis agreement was the administration's model for a \"plan of progress.\" Johnson and his assistants soon pressured other defense contractors, including [[Boeing]] and [[General Electric]], to sign similar voluntary agreements indicating plans for progress. However, these plans were just that, voluntary. Many corporations in the South, still afflicted with [[Jim Crow laws]], largely ignored the federal recommendations.<ref name=Anderson2004/>{{rp|63\u201364}}\n\nThis eventually led to LBJ's [[Civil Rights Act of 1964|Civil Rights Act]], which came shortly after [[Assassination of John F. Kennedy|President Kennedy's assassination]]. This document was more holistic than any President Kennedy had offered, and therefore more controversial. It aimed not only to integrate public facilities, but also private businesses that sold to the public, such as motels, restaurants, theaters, and gas stations. Public schools, hospitals, libraries, parks, among other things, were included in the bill as well. It also worked with JFK's executive order 11114 by prohibiting discrimination in the awarding of federal contracts and holding the authority of the government to deny contracts to businesses who discriminate. Maybe most significant of all, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act aimed to end discrimination in all firms with 25 or more employees. Another provision established the [[Equal Employment Opportunity Commission]] as the agency charged with ending discrimination in the nation's workplace.<ref name=Anderson2004/>{{rp|74}}\n\n[[Conservatism in the United States|Conservatives]] said that Title VII of the bill advocated a [[de facto]] quota system, and asserted unconstitutionality as it attempts to regulate the workplace. Minnesota Senator [[Hubert Humphrey]] corrected this notion: \"there is nothing in [Title VII] that will give power to the Commission to require hiring, firing, and promotion to meet a racial 'quota.' [. . .] Title VII is designed to encourage the hiring on basis of ability and qualifications, not race or religion.\" Title VII prohibits discrimination. Humphrey was the silent hero of the bill's passing through Congress. He pledged that the bill required no quotas, just nondiscrimination. Doing so, he convinced many pro-business [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]], including Senate Minority Leader [[Everett Dirksen]] (IL) to support Title VII.<ref name=Anderson2004/>{{rp|78\u201380}}\n\nOn July 2, 1964, the Act was signed into law by President Johnson.

In 1969, the Nixon administration initiated the \"[[Revised Philadelphia Plan|Philadelphia Order]]\". It was regarded as the most forceful plan thus far to guarantee fair hiring practices in construction jobs. [[Philadelphia]] was selected as the test case because, as Assistant Secretary of Labor [[Arthur Fletcher]] explained, \"The craft unions and the construction industry are among the most egregious offenders against equal opportunity laws . . . openly hostile toward letting blacks into their closed circle.\" The order included definite \"goals and timetables.\" As President Nixon asserted, \"We would not impose quotas, but would require federal contractors to show 'affirmative action' to meet the goals of increasing minority employment.\"<ref name = AATimeline>{{cite web |url=http://www.acri.org/historical.html |title=Press Release |website=acri.org |publisher=American Civil Rights Institute |date= |accessdate=November 26, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130531055048/http://www.acri.org/historical.html |archive-date=May 31, 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nIt was through the Philadelphia Plan that the Nixon administration formed their adapted definition of affirmative action and became the official policy of the US government.

According to a 2010 article by Professor Qin Zhang of Fairfield University, Asians are characterized as one dimensional in having great work ethic and valuing education, but lacking in communication skills and personality.<ref name=\":7\" /><ref>{{Cite journal | last = Zhang | first = Qin | title = Asian Americans beyond the model minority stereotype: the nerdy and the left out | journal = Journal of International and Intercultural Communication | volume = 3 | issue = 1 | pages = 20\u201337 | doi = 10.1080/17513050903428109 | date = February 2010 | ref = harv | url = https://digitalcommons.fairfield.edu/communications-facultypubs/24 }}</ref> A negative outcome of this stereotype is that Asians have been portrayed as having poor leadership and interpersonal skills.

Furthermore, those in favor of affirmative action see it as an effort towards inclusion rather than a discriminatory practice. \"Job discrimination is grounded in prejudice and exclusion, whereas affirmative action is an effort to overcome prejudicial treatment through inclusion. The most effective way to cure society of exclusionary practices is to make special efforts at inclusion, which is exactly what affirmative action does.\"<ref>{{citation | last = Plous | first = Scott | author-link = Scott Plous | contribution = Ten myths about affirmative action | editor-last = Plous | editor-first = Scott | editor-link = Scott Plous | title = Understanding prejudice and discrimination | pages = 206\u201312 | publisher = McGraw-Hill | location = Boston | year = 2003 | isbn = 9780072554434 | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [http://www.understandingprejudice.org/readroom/articles/affirm.htm Available from the Social Psychology Network.]<br />\n:Originally published as: {{Cite journal | last = Plous | first = Scott | author-link = Scott Plous | title = Ten myths about affirmative action | journal = [[Journal of Social Issues]] | volume = 52 | issue = 4 | pages = 25\u201331 | doi = 10.1111/j.1540-4560.1996.tb01846.x | date = Winter 1996 | ref = none | citeseerx = 10.1.1.618.4768 }}</ref>\n\n===Prominent people in support of affirmative action===\nThere are a multitude of supporters as well as opponents to the policy of affirmative action. Many presidents throughout the last century have failed to take a very firm stance on the policy, and the public has had to discern the president's opinion for themselves. [[Bill Clinton]], however, made his stance on affirmative action very clear in a speech on July 19, 1995, nearly two and a half years after his inauguration. In his speech, he discussed the history in the United States that brought the policy into fruition: slavery, Jim Crow, and segregation. Clinton also mentioned a point similar to President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]]'s \"Freedom is not Enough\" speech, and declared that just outlawing discrimination in the country would not be enough to give everyone in America equality. He addressed the arguments that affirmative action hurt the white middle class and said that the policy was not the source of their problems. Clinton plainly outlined his stance on affirmative action, saying:\n\n<blockquote>Let me be clear about what affirmative action must not mean and what I won't allow it to be. It does not mean \u2013 and I don't favor \u2013 the unjustified preference of the unqualified over the qualified of any race or gender. It doesn't mean \u2013 and I don't favor \u2013 numerical quotas. It doesn't mean \u2013 and I don't favor \u2013 rejection or selection of any employee or student solely on the basis of race or gender without regard to merit\u2026</blockquote>\n\nIn the end, Clinton stated that all the evidence shows that, even though affirmative action should be a temporary policy, the time had not come for it to be ended. He felt it was still a relevant practice and overall, the goal of the nation should be to \"mend it, but don't end it.\"  Clinton's words became a slogan for many Americans on the topic of affirmative action.<ref name=Anderson2004/>\n\n===Diversity===\nThe National Conference of State Legislatures held in Washington D.C. stated in a 2014 overview that many supporters for affirmative action argue that policies stemming from affirmative action help to open doors for historically excluded groups in workplace settings and higher education.<ref name=\":0\"/> Workplace diversity has become a business management concept in which employers actively seek to promote an inclusive workplace.<ref name=\":9\">{{Cite web |url = http://www.eeoc.gov/eeoc/task_reports/best_practices.cfm|title = Best practices of private sector employers |date = 1994|accessdate = March 24, 2015|website = eeoc.gov |publisher = [[Equal Employment Opportunity Commission|U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission]] |last = |first =}}</ref> By valuing diversity, employers possess the capacity to create an environment in which there is a culture of respect for individual differences as well as the ability to draw in talent and ideas from all segments of the population.<ref name=\":10\">{{Cite journal | last = Card | first = Robert F. | title = Making sense of the diversity-based legal argument for affirmative action | journal = [[Public Affairs Quarterly]] | volume = 19 | issue = 1  | pages = 11\u201324 | date = January 2005 | jstor = 40441397 | ref = harv }}</ref> By creating this diverse workforce, these employers and companies gain a competitive advantage in an increasingly global economy.<ref name=\":10\" /> According to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, many private sector employers have concluded that a diverse workforce makes a \"company stronger, more profitable, and a better place to work.\" Therefore, these diversity promoting policies are implemented for competitive reasons rather than as a response to discrimination, but have shown the value in having diversity.<ref name=\":9\" />\n\nIn the year 2000, according to a study by American Association of University Professors (AAUP), affirmative action promoted diversity within colleges and universities.

According to these opponents, this contradiction might make affirmative action counter-productive. One argument for reverse discrimination is the idea that affirmative action encourages mediocrity and incompetence. Job positions would not be offered to the applicants who are the most qualified, but to applicants with a special trait such as a certain race, ethnicity, or gender.<ref name=\":12\" /> For example, opponents say affirmative action causes unprepared applicants to be accepted in highly demanding educational institutions or jobs which result in eventual failure (see, for example, Richard Sander's study of affirmative action in Law School, bar exam and eventual performance at law firms).

[[Florida]] and California have also replaced racial quotas with class rank and other criteria. Class rank tends to benefit top students at less competitive high schools, to the detriment of students at more competitive high schools. This effect, however, may be intentional since less-funded, less competitive schools are more likely to be schools where minority enrollment is high. Critics argue that class rank is more a measure of one's peers than of one's self.

Less qualified black students would attend less prestigious schools where they would be more closely matched in abilities with their classmates and thus perform relatively better.<ref name=Sander_Sys /> Sander helped to develop a socioeconomically-based affirmative action plan for the UCLA School of Law after the passage of [[California Proposition 209 (1996)|Proposition 209 in 1996]], which prohibited the use of racial preferences by public universities in California. This change occurred after studies showed that the graduation rate of blacks at UCLA was 41%, compared to 73% for whites.\n\nA study in 2007 by Mark Long, an economics professor at the [[University of Washington]], demonstrated that the alternatives of affirmative action proved ineffective in restoring minority enrollment in public flagship universities in California, Texas, and Washington.<ref name=Long>{{cite journal|last=Long|first=Mark|title= Affirmative action and its alternatives in public universities: What do we know? |journal= Public Administration Review |year=2007|pages=315\u201330 |url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/197174345/|doi=10.1111/j.1540-6210.2007.00715.x|volume=67|issue=2}}</ref> More specifically, apparent rebounds of minority enrollment can be explained by increasing minority enrollment in high schools of those states, and the beneficiaries of class-based (not race) affirmative action would be white students.<ref name=Long /> At the same time, affirmative action itself is both morally and materially costly: 52 percent of white populace (compared to 14 percent of black) thought it should be abolished, implying white distaste of using racial identity, and full-file review is expected to cost the universities an additional $1.5 million to $2 million per year, excluding possible cost of litigation.<ref name=Long />\n\n===Complaints and lawsuits===\nDean Pollak wrote of the Yale quota for black students in response to a letter from Judge Macklin Fleming of the [[California Court of Appeal]]. Fleming criticized the Yale system as \"a long step toward the practice of ''[[apartheid]]'' and the maintenance of two law schools under one roof\", with consequent \"damage to the standards of Yale Law School\". He warned that such an admission policy \"will serve to perpetuate the very ideas and prejudices it is designed to combat. If in a given class the great majority of the black students are at the bottom of the class\", it would result in racial stratification between students, demands by black students to weaken academic standards, and other racially based \"aggressive conduct\". Fleming noted that racial quotas were a [[zero-sum game]], as \"discrimination in favor of X is automatic discrimination against Y\"; Asians in California, for example, were overrepresented in engineering schools and would suffer if black and Mexican applicants received preferential treatment.

The first federal policy of [[race-conscious]] affirmative action was the [[Revised Philadelphia Plan]], implemented in 1969, which required certain government contractors to set \"goals and timetables\" for integrating and diversifying their workforce. Similar policies emerged through a mix of voluntary practices and federal and state policies in employment and education. Affirmative action as a practice was partially upheld by the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] in ''[[Grutter v. Bollinger]] ''(2003), while the use of racial quotas for college admissions was concurrently ruled unconstitutional by the Court in ''[[Gratz v. Bollinger]]'' (2003).\n\nAffirmative action is  likely to give rise to controversy in American politics. Supporters argue that affirmative action is still needed to counteract continuing bias and prejudice against women and minorities. Opponents argue that these policies amount to discrimination against non-minorities which entails favoring one group over another based upon racial preference rather than achievement, and many believe that the diversity of current American society suggests that affirmative action policies succeeded and are no longer required.<ref>{{Cite news\n |title = Affirmative Action\n |date = June 15, 2009\n |url = http://topics.nytimes.com/topics/reference/timestopics/subjects/a/affirmative_action/index.html\n |accessdate = May 5, 2010\n| newspaper=The New York Times\n| first=Ross\n| last=Douthat| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100521064855/http://topics.nytimes.com/topics/reference/timestopics/subjects/a/affirmative_action/index.html| archivedate= May 21, 2010 | url-status= live}}\n</ref> Supporters point to contemporary examples of conscious and unconscious biases, such as the finding that job-seekers with black-sounding names are 50% less likely to get a callback than those with white-sounding names, as proof that affirmative action is not obsolete.<ref name=\":17\" />\n\n==History==\n===Origins===\nThe policy now called affirmative action came as early as the [[Reconstruction era|Reconstruction Era]] (1863\u20131877) in which a [[Freedman|former slave]] population lacked the skills and resources for independent living.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal | last = Fran\u00e7ois | first = Anderson Bellegarde | title = The brand of inferiority: the civil rights act of 1875, white supremacy, and affirmative action | journal = [[Howard University School of Law#Publications|Howard Law Journal]] | volume = 57 | issue = 2 | pages = 573\u201399 | date = Winter 2014 | url = http://iibp.chadwyck.com/toc/00186813/572Winter2014.htm | ref = harv }} [http://www.law.howard.edu/dictator/media/229/how_57_2.pdf Pdf.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150806223050/http://www.law.howard.edu/dictator/media/229/how_57_2.pdf |date=August 6, 2015 }}</ref> In 1865, General [[William Tecumseh Sherman]] proposed, for practical reasons, to divide the land and goods from [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] and grant it to black families, which became the \"[[Forty acres and a mule]]\" policy.<ref name=\":2\" /> The proposal was never widely adopted due to strong political opposition, and Sherman's orders were soon revoked by President Andrew Johnson.

Hearing of the incident, Truman turned to [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People|NAACP]] leader [[Walter Francis White]] and declared, \"My God! I had no idea it was as terrible as that. We've got to do something.\" In 1947 the committee published its findings, [[To Secure These Rights]]. The book was widely read, influential, and considered utopian for the times: \"In our land men are equal, but they are free to be different. From these very differences among our people has come the great human and national strength of America.\" The report discussed and demonstrated racial discrimination in basic freedoms, education, public facilities, personal safety, and employment opportunities. The committee was disturbed by the state of race relations, and included the [[Internment of Japanese Americans|evacuation of Americans of Japanese descent]] during the war \"made without a trial or any sort of hearing\u2026Fundamental to our whole system of law is the belief that guilt is personal and not a matter of heredity or association.\" The recommendations were radical, calling for federal policies and laws to end racial discrimination and bring about equality: \"We can tolerate no restrictions upon the individual which depend upon irrelevant factors such as his race, his color, his religion, or the social position to which he is born.\" To Secure These Rights set the liberal legislative agenda for the next generation that eventually would be signed into law by [[Lyndon B. Johnson]].<ref name=Anderson2004/>{{rp|35\u201336}}\n\nTo Secure These Rights also called for [[desegregation]] of the [[United States Armed Forces|Armed Forces]]. \"Prejudice in any area is an ugly, undemocratic phenomenon, but in the armed services, where all men run the risk of death, it is especially repugnant.\" The rationale was fairness: \"When an individual enters the service of the country, he necessarily surrenders some of the rights and privileges which are inherent in American citizenship.\" In return, the government \"undertakes to protect his integrity as an individual.\" Yet that was not possible in the segregated Army, since \"any discrimination which\u2026prevents members of the minority groups from rendering full military service in defense of their country is for them a humiliating badge of inferiority.\" The report called for an end to \"all discrimination and segregation based on race, color, creed, or national origins in\u2026all branches of the Armed Services.\"<ref name=Anderson2004/>{{rp|38\u201339}}\n\nIn 1947 Truman and his advisors came up with a plan for a large standing military, called Universal Military Training, and presented it to Congress.

It consisted of ten objectives that Congress should focus on when enacting legislation. Truman concluded by saying, \"If we wish to inspire the peoples of the world whose freedom is in jeopardy, if we wish to restore hope to those who have already lost their civil liberties, if we wish to fulfill the promise that is ours, we must correct the remaining imperfections in our practice of democracy.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.trumanlibrary.org/publicpapers/index.php?pid=1380&st=&st1= |title=Special message to the Congress on civil rights |author=Harry S.

According to his speech, America had \"reached a turning point in the long history of our country's efforts to guarantee freedom and equality to all our citizens\u2026Each man must be guaranteed equality of opportunity.\" He proposed what black citizens had been calling for \u2013 an enhanced role of federal authority through the states. \"We must make the Federal government a friendly, vigilant defender of the rights and equalities of all [[Americans]].

Executive Order 9980, named Regulations Governing for Employment Practices within the Federal Establishment, instituted fair employment practices in the civilian agencies of the federal government. The order created the position of Fair Employment Officer. The order \"established in the Civil Service Commission a Fair Employment Board of not less than seven persons.\"<ref name=Exec_9980/> Executive Order 9981, named Establishing the President's Committee on Equality of Treatment and Opportunity in the Armed Services, called for the integration of the Armed Forces and the creation of the [[National Military Establishment]] to carry out the executive order.<ref name=Exec_9981>{{cite web|url=http://www.trumanlibrary.org/executiveorders/index.php?pid=869&st=&st1= |title=Executive Orders Harry S.

Eisenhower]]\n\nWhen Eisenhower was elected President in 1952 after defeating Democratic candidate Adlai Stevenson, he believed hiring practices and anti-discrimination laws should be decided by the states, although the administration gradually continued to desegregate the Armed Forces and the federal government.<ref name=Anderson2004/>{{rp|50}} The President also established the [[Executive Order 10479|Government Contract Committee]] in 1953, which \"conducted surveys of the racial composition of federal employees and tax-supported contractors\".<ref name=Anderson2004/>{{rp|50\u201351}} The committee, chaired by Vice President [[Richard Nixon]], had minimal outcomes in that they imposed the contractors with the primary responsibility of desegregation within their own companies and corporations.<ref name=Anderson2004/>{{rp|51}}\n\n===Kennedy administration (1961-1963)===\n''Further information'': [[John F. Kennedy]]\n\nIn the [[1960 United States presidential election|1960 presidential election]], [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] candidate and eventual winner [[John F. Kennedy]] \"criticized President Eisenhower for not ending discrimination in federally supported housing\" and \"advocated a permanent [[Fair Employment Practices Commission]]\".<ref name=Anderson2004/>{{rp|59}} Shortly after taking office, Kennedy issued [[Executive Order 10925]] in March 1961, requiring government contractors to \"consider and recommend additional affirmative steps which should be taken by executive departments and agencies to realize more fully the national policy of nondiscrimination\u2026. The contractor will take affirmative action to ensure that applicants are employed, and that employees are treated during employment, without regard to their race, creed, color, or national origin\".<ref name=Anderson2004/>{{rp|60}} The order also established the [[Equal Employment Opportunity Commission|President's Committee on Equal Employment Opportunity]] (PCEEO), chaired by Vice President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]]. Federal contractors who failed to comply or violated the executive order were punished by contract cancellation and the possible debarment from future government contracts. The administration was \"not demanding any special preference or treatment or quotas for minorities\" but was rather \"advocating racially neutral hiring to end job discrimination\".<ref name=Anderson2004/>{{rp|61}} Turning to issues of [[women's rights]], Kennedy initiated a [[Presidential Commission on the Status of Women|Commission on the Status of Women]] in December 1961. The commission was charged with \"examining employment policies and practices of the government and of contractors\" with regard to sex.<ref name=Anderson2004/>{{rp|66}}\n\nIn June 1963, President Kennedy continued his policy of affirmative action by issuing another mandate, [[Executive Order 11114]]. The order supplemented to his previous 1961 executive order declaring it was the \"policy of the United States to encourage by affirmative action the elimination of discrimination in employment\".<ref name=Anderson2004/>{{rp|72}} Through this order, all federal funds, such as \"grants, loans, unions and employers who accepted taxpayer funds, and other forms of financial assistance to state and local governments,\" were forced to comply to the government's policies on affirmative action in employment practices.<ref name=Anderson2004/>{{rp|72}}\n\n===Johnson administration (1963-1969)===\n[[Lyndon B. Johnson]], the Texan Democrat and [[Party leaders of the United States Senate|Senate Majority Leader]] from 1955\u20131961, began to consider running for high office, and in doing so showed how his racial views differed from those held by many [[White American]]s in the traditional [[Southern United States|South]]. In 1957, Johnson brokered a civil rights act through Congress. The bill established a Civil Rights Division and Commission in the [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]]. The commission was empowered to investigate allegations of minority deprivation of rights.<ref name=Anderson2004/>{{rp|57}}\n\nThe first time \"affirmative action\" is used by the federal government concerning race is in President John F. Kennedy's Executive Order 10925, which was chaired by Vice President Johnson. At Johnson's inaugural ball in Texas, he met with a young black lawyer, [[Hobart Taylor, Jr.]], and gave him the task to co-author the executive order. \"Affirmative action\" was chosen due to its [[Alliteration|alliterative]] quality. The term \"active recruitment\" started to be used as well. This order, albeit heavily worked up as a significant piece of legislation, in reality carried little actual power. The scope was limited to a couple hundred defense contractors, leaving nearly $7.5 billion in federal grants and loans unsupervised.<ref name=Anderson2004/>{{rp|60}}\n\n[[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People|NAACP]] had many problem's with JFK's \"token\" proposal. They wanted jobs. One day after the order took effect, NAACP labor secretary [[Herbert Hill (labor director)|Herbert Hill]] filed complaints against the hiring and promoting practices of [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed Aircraft Corporation]]. Lockheed was doing business with the [[United States Department of Defense|Defense Department]] on the first billion-dollar contract. Due to taxpayer-funding being 90% of Lockheed's business, along with disproportionate hiring practices, black workers charged Lockheed with \"overt discrimination.\" Lockheed signed an agreement with Vice President Johnson that pledged an \"aggressive seeking out for more qualified minority candidates for technical and skill positions.<ref name=Anderson2004/>{{rp|63\u201364}}\nThis agreement was the administration's model for a \"plan of progress.\" Johnson and his assistants soon pressured other defense contractors, including [[Boeing]] and [[General Electric]], to sign similar voluntary agreements indicating plans for progress. However, these plans were just that, voluntary. Many corporations in the South, still afflicted with [[Jim Crow laws]], largely ignored the federal recommendations.<ref name=Anderson2004/>{{rp|63\u201364}}\n\nThis eventually led to LBJ's [[Civil Rights Act of 1964|Civil Rights Act]], which came shortly after [[Assassination of John F. Kennedy|President Kennedy's assassination]]. This document was more holistic than any President Kennedy had offered, and therefore more controversial. It aimed not only to integrate public facilities, but also private businesses that sold to the public, such as motels, restaurants, theaters, and gas stations. Public schools, hospitals, libraries, parks, among other things, were included in the bill as well. It also worked with JFK's executive order 11114 by prohibiting discrimination in the awarding of federal contracts and holding the authority of the government to deny contracts to businesses who discriminate. Maybe most significant of all, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act aimed to end discrimination in all firms with 25 or more employees. Another provision established the [[Equal Employment Opportunity Commission]] as the agency charged with ending discrimination in the nation's workplace.<ref name=Anderson2004/>{{rp|74}}\n\n[[Conservatism in the United States|Conservatives]] said that Title VII of the bill advocated a [[de facto]] quota system, and asserted unconstitutionality as it attempts to regulate the workplace. Minnesota Senator [[Hubert Humphrey]] corrected this notion: \"there is nothing in [Title VII] that will give power to the Commission to require hiring, firing, and promotion to meet a racial 'quota.' [. . .] Title VII is designed to encourage the hiring on basis of ability and qualifications, not race or religion.\" Title VII prohibits discrimination. Humphrey was the silent hero of the bill's passing through Congress. He pledged that the bill required no quotas, just nondiscrimination. Doing so, he convinced many pro-business [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]], including Senate Minority Leader [[Everett Dirksen]] (IL) to support Title VII.<ref name=Anderson2004/>{{rp|78\u201380}}\n\nOn July 2, 1964, the Act was signed into law by President Johnson. A [[Harris Insights & Analytics|Harris poll]] that spring showed 70% citizen approval of the Act.<ref name=Anderson2004/>{{rp|82}}\n\n===Nixon administration (1969-1974)===\n{{details|Richard Nixon}}\nThe strides that the Johnson presidency made in ensuring equal opportunity in the workforce were further picked up by his successor Richard Nixon. In 1969, the Nixon administration initiated the \"[[Revised Philadelphia Plan|Philadelphia Order]]\". It was regarded as the most forceful plan thus far to guarantee fair hiring practices in construction jobs. [[Philadelphia]] was selected as the test case because, as Assistant Secretary of Labor [[Arthur Fletcher]] explained, \"The craft unions and the construction industry are among the most egregious offenders against equal opportunity laws . . . openly hostile toward letting blacks into their closed circle.\" The order included definite \"goals and timetables.\" As President Nixon asserted, \"We would not impose quotas, but would require federal contractors to show 'affirmative action' to meet the goals of increasing minority employment.\"<ref name = AATimeline>{{cite web |url=http://www.acri.org/historical.html |title=Press Release |website=acri.org |publisher=American Civil Rights Institute |date= |accessdate=November 26, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130531055048/http://www.acri.org/historical.html |archive-date=May 31, 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nIt was through the Philadelphia Plan that the Nixon administration formed their adapted definition of affirmative action and became the official policy of the US government.

While the [[Presidency of Ronald Reagan|Reagan administration]] opposed discriminatory practices, it did not support the implementation of it in the form of quotas and goals (Executive Order 11246).<ref>Williams, Juan (July 11th, 1985). \"Reagan Considers Stance On Affirmative Action\". ''The Washington Post''.</ref> Bi-partisan opposition in Congress and other government officials blocked the repeal of this Executive Order. Reagan was particularly known for his opposition to affirmative action programs. He reduced funding for the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, citing that \"reverse discrimination\" resulted from these policies.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.u-s-history.com/pages/h1970.html|title=Affirmative Action|website=www.u-s-history.com|access-date=2019-10-20}}</ref> However, the courts reaffirmed affirmative action policies such as quotas. In 1986, the Supreme Court ruled that courts could order race-based quotas to fight discrimination in worker unions in ''Sheet Metal Workers' International Association v. EEOC'', 478 U.S. 42. In 1987, in ''Johnson v. Transportation Agency, Santa Clara County, California'', 480 U.S. 616, the Supreme Court ruled that sex or race was a factor that could be considered in a pool of qualified candidates by employers. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.aaaed.org/aaaed/history_of_affirmative_action.asp|title=History of Affirmative Action|website=American Association for Access Equity and Diversity - AAAED|language=en-us|access-date=2019-10-20}}</ref>\n\n=== Obama Administration (2009-2017) ===\n''Further information: [[Barack Obama]]''\n\nAfter the election and inauguration of Barack Obama in the 2008 election, a huge excitement swept the nation for the first African-American president of the United States.

In 2009, education statistics denote the problems of college admissions in the US: \"The College Board recently released the average 2009 SAT scores by race and ethnicity.

Many presidents throughout the last century have failed to take a very firm stance on the policy, and the public has had to discern the president's opinion for themselves. [[Bill Clinton]], however, made his stance on affirmative action very clear in a speech on July 19, 1995, nearly two and a half years after his inauguration. In his speech, he discussed the history in the United States that brought the policy into fruition: slavery, Jim Crow, and segregation. Clinton also mentioned a point similar to President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]]'s \"Freedom is not Enough\" speech, and declared that just outlawing discrimination in the country would not be enough to give everyone in America equality. He addressed the arguments that affirmative action hurt the white middle class and said that the policy was not the source of their problems. Clinton plainly outlined his stance on affirmative action, saying:\n\n<blockquote>Let me be clear about what affirmative action must not mean and what I won't allow it to be. It does not mean \u2013 and I don't favor \u2013 the unjustified preference of the unqualified over the qualified of any race or gender. It doesn't mean \u2013 and I don't favor \u2013 numerical quotas. It doesn't mean \u2013 and I don't favor \u2013 rejection or selection of any employee or student solely on the basis of race or gender without regard to merit\u2026</blockquote>\n\nIn the end, Clinton stated that all the evidence shows that, even though affirmative action should be a temporary policy, the time had not come for it to be ended. He felt it was still a relevant practice and overall, the goal of the nation should be to \"mend it, but don't end it.\"  Clinton's words became a slogan for many Americans on the topic of affirmative action.<ref name=Anderson2004/>\n\n===Diversity===\nThe National Conference of State Legislatures held in Washington D.C. stated in a 2014 overview that many supporters for affirmative action argue that policies stemming from affirmative action help to open doors for historically excluded groups in workplace settings and higher education.<ref name=\":0\"/> Workplace diversity has become a business management concept in which employers actively seek to promote an inclusive workplace.<ref name=\":9\">{{Cite web |url = http://www.eeoc.gov/eeoc/task_reports/best_practices.cfm|title = Best practices of private sector employers |date = 1994|accessdate = March 24, 2015|website = eeoc.gov |publisher = [[Equal Employment Opportunity Commission|U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission]] |last = |first =}}</ref> By valuing diversity, employers possess the capacity to create an environment in which there is a culture of respect for individual differences as well as the ability to draw in talent and ideas from all segments of the population.<ref name=\":10\">{{Cite journal | last = Card | first = Robert F. | title = Making sense of the diversity-based legal argument for affirmative action | journal = [[Public Affairs Quarterly]] | volume = 19 | issue = 1  | pages = 11\u201324 | date = January 2005 | jstor = 40441397 | ref = harv }}</ref> By creating this diverse workforce, these employers and companies gain a competitive advantage in an increasingly global economy.<ref name=\":10\" /> According to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, many private sector employers have concluded that a diverse workforce makes a \"company stronger, more profitable, and a better place to work.\" Therefore, these diversity promoting policies are implemented for competitive reasons rather than as a response to discrimination, but have shown the value in having diversity.<ref name=\":9\" />\n\nIn the year 2000, according to a study by American Association of University Professors (AAUP), affirmative action promoted diversity within colleges and universities.

Opponents of racial affirmative action argue that the program actually benefits middle- and upper-class [[African Americans]] and [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Hispanic Americans]] at the expense of lower-class [[European Americans]] and [[Asian Americans]]. This argument supports the idea of class-based affirmative action. America's poor is disproportionately made up of people of color, so class-based affirmative action would disproportionately help people of color. This would eliminate the need for race-based affirmative action as well as reducing any disproportionate benefits for middle- and upper-class people of color.<ref>{{citation | last = Hurst | first = Charles E. | contribution = Addressing inequality and poverty: programs and reforms | editor-last = Hurst | editor-first = Charles E. | title = Social inequality: forms, causes, and consequences | pages = 374\u201377 | publisher = Pearson/Allyn and Bacon | location = Boston | year = 2007 | edition = 6th | isbn = 9780205484362 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}</ref>\n\nIn 1976, a group of [[Italian American]] professors at [[City University of New York]] successfully advocated to be added as an affirmative action category for promotion and hiring.

According to these opponents, this contradiction might make affirmative action counter-productive. One argument for reverse discrimination is the idea that affirmative action encourages mediocrity and incompetence. Job positions would not be offered to the applicants who are the most qualified, but to applicants with a special trait such as a certain race, ethnicity, or gender.<ref name=\":12\" /> For example, opponents say affirmative action causes unprepared applicants to be accepted in highly demanding educational institutions or jobs which result in eventual failure (see, for example, Richard Sander's study of affirmative action in Law School, bar exam and eventual performance at law firms). Other opponents say that affirmative action lowers the bar and so denies those who strive for excellence on their own merit and the sense of real achievement.<ref name=\":12\" /> Opponents of affirmative action suggest that merit should be the primary factor considered in applying for job positions, college, graduate school, etc.<ref name=\":12\" />\n\nOthers argue that affirmative action is no longer necessary and that the United States has become a melting pot of minorities to the extent that whites will eventually become the minority.<ref name=\":13\" /> Arguments are made that although affirmative action policies might have been necessary in the past, they are now obsolete.

[[Florida]] and California have also replaced racial quotas with class rank and other criteria. Class rank tends to benefit top students at less competitive high schools, to the detriment of students at more competitive high schools. This effect, however, may be intentional since less-funded, less competitive schools are more likely to be schools where minority enrollment is high. Critics argue that class rank is more a measure of one's peers than of one's self.

One Harvard student, born in the South Bronx to a black family whose ancestors have been in the United States for multiple generations, said that there were so few Harvard students from the historic African American community that they took to calling themselves \"the descendants\" (i.e., descendants of [[Slavery in the United States|American slaves]]). The reasons for this underrepresentation of historic African Americans, and possible remedies, remain a subject of debate.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/06/24/us/top-colleges-take-more-blacks-but-which-ones.html |title=Top colleges take more Blacks, but which ones? |first=Sara |last=Rimer |author2=Arenson, Karen W. | work = [[The New York Times]] |publisher= [[The New York Times Company]] |date=June 24, 2004 |accessdate=February 22, 2011}}</ref>\n\n[[UCLA School of Law|UCLA]] professor Richard H.

He noted that, prior to his article, there had been no comprehensive study on the effects of affirmative action.<ref name=Sander_Sys /> The article presents a study that shows that half of all black law students rank near the bottom of their class after the first year of law school and that black law students are more likely to drop out of law school and to fail the bar exam.<ref name=Sander_Sys /> The article offers a tentative estimate that the production of new black lawyers in the United States would grow by eight percent if affirmative action programs at all law schools were ended. Less qualified black students would attend less prestigious schools where they would be more closely matched in abilities with their classmates and thus perform relatively better.<ref name=Sander_Sys /> Sander helped to develop a socioeconomically-based affirmative action plan for the UCLA School of Law after the passage of [[California Proposition 209 (1996)|Proposition 209 in 1996]], which prohibited the use of racial preferences by public universities in California. This change occurred after studies showed that the graduation rate of blacks at UCLA was 41%, compared to 73% for whites.\n\nA study in 2007 by Mark Long, an economics professor at the [[University of Washington]], demonstrated that the alternatives of affirmative action proved ineffective in restoring minority enrollment in public flagship universities in California, Texas, and Washington.<ref name=Long>{{cite journal|last=Long|first=Mark|title= Affirmative action and its alternatives in public universities: What do we know? |journal= Public Administration Review |year=2007|pages=315\u201330 |url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/197174345/|doi=10.1111/j.1540-6210.2007.00715.x|volume=67|issue=2}}</ref> More specifically, apparent rebounds of minority enrollment can be explained by increasing minority enrollment in high schools of those states, and the beneficiaries of class-based (not race) affirmative action would be white students.<ref name=Long /> At the same time, affirmative action itself is both morally and materially costly: 52 percent of white populace (compared to 14 percent of black) thought it should be abolished, implying white distaste of using racial identity, and full-file review is expected to cost the universities an additional $1.5 million to $2 million per year, excluding possible cost of litigation.<ref name=Long />\n\n===Complaints and lawsuits===\nDean Pollak wrote of the Yale quota for black students in response to a letter from Judge Macklin Fleming of the [[California Court of Appeal]]. Fleming criticized the Yale system as \"a long step toward the practice of ''[[apartheid]]'' and the maintenance of two law schools under one roof\", with consequent \"damage to the standards of Yale Law School\". He warned that such an admission policy \"will serve to perpetuate the very ideas and prejudices it is designed to combat. If in a given class the great majority of the black students are at the bottom of the class\", it would result in racial stratification between students, demands by black students to weaken academic standards, and other racially based \"aggressive conduct\". Fleming noted that racial quotas were a [[zero-sum game]], as \"discrimination in favor of X is automatic discrimination against Y\"; Asians in California, for example, were overrepresented in engineering schools and would suffer if black and Mexican applicants received preferential treatment. He stated that a quota system violated \"the American creed, one that Yale has proudly espoused ... that an American should be judged as an individual and not as a member of a group\".{{r|flemingpollak1970}}\n\nIn 2006, Jian Li, a [[Chinese people|Chinese]] undergraduate at [[Yale University]], filed a [[civil rights]] complaint with the [[Office for Civil Rights]] against [[Princeton University]], claiming that his race played a role in their decision to reject his application for admission and seeking the suspension of federal financial assistance to the university until it \"discontinues discrimination against Asian Americans in all forms\" by eliminating race and legacy preferences. Princeton Dean of Admissions Janet Rapelye responded to the claims in the November 30, 2006, issue of the ''Daily Princetonian'' by stating that \"the numbers don't indicate [discrimination].\" She said that Li was not admitted because \"many others had far better qualifications.\" Li's extracurricular activities were described as \"not all that outstanding\".<ref>{{cite news | last = Erbe | first = Anastasia | title = Amid charge of bias, Rapelye stands firm | url = http://www.dailyprincetonian.com/2006/11/30/16798/ | work = [[The Daily Princetonian]] | publisher = Trustees of The Daily Princetonian Publishing Company | accessdate = November 7, 2012 |date = November 30, 2006 }}</ref> Li countered in an email, saying that his placement on the waitlist undermines Rapelye's claim. \"Princeton had initially waitlisted my application,\" Li said. \"So if it were not for a yield which was higher than expected, the admissions office very well may have admitted a candidate whose \"outside activities were not all that outstanding\".<ref>{{cite news | last = Fisch | first = Mendy | title = Department of Education expands inquiry into Jian Li bias case | url = http://www.dailyprincetonian.com/2008/09/08/21307/ | work = [[The Daily Princetonian]] | publisher = Trustees of The Daily Princetonian Publishing Company | accessdate = November 7, 2012 | date = September 8, 2008 }}</ref>\n[[File:Students for Fair Admissions Rally.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A protest in Boston's Copley Square on October 14, 2018 to support the lawsuit from Students for Fair Admissions against Harvard|A protest in Boston's [[Copley Square]] on October 14, 2018 to support the lawsuit from Students for Fair Admissions against Harvard]]\nIn 2012, Abigail Fisher, an undergraduate student at [[Louisiana State University]], and Rachel Multer Michalewicz, a law student at [[Southern Methodist University]], filed a lawsuit to challenge the University of Texas admissions policy, asserting it had a \"race-conscious policy\" that \"violated their civil and constitutional rights\".<ref name=\"The Daily Texan\">{{cite news | last = Associated Press | author-link = Associated Press | title = Fisher v.

In July 2016 a majority of the Court found in favor of the University of Texas at Austin, with Justice Kennedy finding for the Court that the university's affirmative action policies were constitutional, despite the requirement of strict scrutiny.  Justice Alito wrote a lengthy dissent.\n\nOn November 17, 2014, Students for Fair Admissions, an offshoot of the Project on Fair Representation, filed lawsuits in federal district court challenging the admissions practices of Harvard University and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.  The UNC-Chapel Hill lawsuit alleges discrimination against white and Asian students, while the Harvard lawsuit focuses on discrimination against Asian applicants.  Both universities requested the court to halt the lawsuits until the U.S. Supreme Court provides clarification of relevant law by ruling in Fisher v.
