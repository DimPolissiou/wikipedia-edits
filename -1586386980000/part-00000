On 27 April he subscribed the band to \"defend the liberty of the Evangell of Christ\", and he also subscribed the \"Book of Discipline\". He was one of those deputed by the General Assembly on 28 May 1561 to suppress \"Idolatrie and all monuments thereof,\" and when [[Mary, Queen of Scots]] arrived from France in August 1561, and made known her intention of having mass said in her private chapel at [[Holyroodhouse]], he and his followers gathered in front of it, exclaiming that \"the idolater priest should die the death.\"<ref>Knox, ''History'', vol.2, p. 45, 63, 129, 163, 270</ref> [[Claude Nau]] asserts that he \"drove the chaplain from the chapel and overthrew all the memorials,\"<ref>Stevenson, Joseph, ed., ''Life of Queen Mary'', (1887) p. 326</ref> but Knox states that [[Regent Moray|Lord James (afterwards Earl of Moray)]] kept the door and prevented Lindsay entering the chapel.<ref>Knox, ''Works'', vol. 2, p. 270</ref>\n\n===Mary's personal reign===\nLindsay was specially devoted to Lord James, who was his brother-in-law, and through his mediation Lindsay and the queen were soon reconciled. [[Thomas Randolph (diplomat)|Thomas Randolph]] wrote to Cecil from St. Andrews on 25 April 1562, \"It would well have contented your honour, to have seen the queen and the Master of Lindsay shoot at the butts against the Earl of Marr (as Lord James had become) and one of the ladies.\" On the rebellion of the [[Earl of Huntly]] during the queen's progress in the north of Scotland in the following September, Lindsay and Kirkcaldy of Grange were, with their followers, specially summoned to her assistance;<ref>Randolph to Cecil in ''Calendar State Papers, For.

State Papers, For. Ser. 1563\u20134'', no.1523</ref> Rothes obtained the sheriffdom, though on 12 January 1565 he agreed that Lindsay should be exempted from its jurisdiction,<ref>''Reg. P. C. Scotland'', i. 315</ref> Lindsay was never reconciled to the loss of the office.\n\nBeing related to Darnley, Lindsay, in opposition to Moray and the stricter Reformers, favoured Darnley's marriage to the queen. In the [[Chaseabout Raid]] against Moray he \"accompanied the king in leading the battle.\"<ref>''RPCS'', p. 379</ref> The subsequent policy of the queen made him a zealous supporter of the plot for the murder of [[David Rizzio]], and on the night of the murder he accompanied Morton to [[Holyroodhouse]] with a band of armed followers.<ref>''Calendar State Papers Scotland'', vol.2 (1900), p.270</ref> When Mary escaped to Dunbar, Lindsay fled to England with the other contrivers of Rizzio's murder, but the queen pardoned him, Morton, and others shortly before the murder of Darnley.<ref>Bedford to Cecil, 30 Dec. 1566, in ''Cal. State Papers, For. Ser. 1566\u20138'', no. 872</ref>\n\n===Mary's abdication===\nThere is no evidence that Lindsay was aware of any scheme to murder Darnley, and perhaps, like his kinsman Atholl, he deeply resented Darnley's murder. Such resentment may partly account for the prominent part he played in proceedings against Mary. He signed at Stirling the bond against Bothwell. At the [[battle of Carberry Hill]] on 15 June 1567 he asked the Confederate lords to permit him to accept Bothwell's challenge to single combat \"in regard of his nearness of blood to the defunct king.\" The [[Regent Morton|Earl of Morton]] presented him with the famous two-handed sword of his ancestor [[Archibald Douglas, 5th Earl of Angus|Archibald Bell-the-Cat]],<ref>Hewitt, ''Scotland under Morton'', John Donald (1982), p. 10, citing Calderwood, ''History of the Kirk of Scotland'', (1843), pp.363-4.</ref> but the queen's interference prevented the encounter.<ref>Hume of Godscroft, ''House of Douglas'', p. 297; Knox; ii. 561; Sir James Melville, ''Memoirs'', p. 184</ref> Lindsay was largely responsible for the hard terms made with the queen. After her surrender, when she understood that she was practically the prisoner of the Confederate lords, she sent for Lindsay, and, giving him her hand, exclaimed, \"By the hand which is now in yours I'll have your head for this.\"<ref>Drury to Cecil, 18 June 1567</ref>\n\nLindsay, along with Lord Ruthven, conveyed Mary to [[Lochleven Castle]], and they and the lord of the castle, Robert Douglas,  Lindsay's father-in-law, were jointly made her guardians. On 24 July 1567 Lindsay went to obtain her signature to the [[Act Anent the demission of the Crown in favour of our Sovereign Lord, and his Majesty's Coronation 1567|deed abdicating the crown]]. According to a later Catholic account, Lindsay told her \"that if she did not sign the document she would compel them to cut her throat, however unwilling they might be.\"<ref>Stevenson, Joseph ed., ''Nau's Queen Mary'', p. 60, 'Report upon the State of Scotland by the Jesuit Priests'</ref> [[James Melville of Halhill]] wrote that Mary was told that Lindsay was in a \"boasting humour\" before his arrival, and that she signed the document without demur.<ref>Melville, ''Memoirs'', p. 190</ref>\n\nThe next day Lindsay brought this resignation, or commission, to the [[Old Tolbooth, Edinburgh|Tolbooth of Edinburgh]] where it was read aloud.<ref>''Register Privy Council Scotland'', vol 1, (1877), pp. 531\u20134</ref> On the 29 July, immediately before [[James VI of Scotland]] was crowned at [[Stirling]]'s [[Church of the Holy Rude|Holy Rude Kirk]], Lindsay and [[William Ruthven, 1st Earl of Gowrie|Lord Ruthven]] declared their oath that Mary had \"resigned willingly without compulsion.\"<ref>''Calendar State Papers Scotland'', vol.2 (1900), p.370</ref> Subsequently, Lindsay was one of the staunchest supporters of Regent Moray. In the forged ''Conference about the Regent Moray'' he is represented as saying: \"My lord, ye know of ould that I was moir rude than wyse. I can nought gyve you a verie wyse counsell, but I love you weill aneuche.\"<ref>''Bannatyne Miscellany'', vol. 1. 38; Calderwood, vol.2, 516</ref>\n\nAfter Mary's escape from Lochleven Lindsay fought against her at [[battle of Langside|Langside]], and by reinforcing the right wing of the Regent's army as it was about to give way turned the tide of the battle.<ref>James Melville, ''Memoirs'', p. 202; ''History of James the Sext'', p. 26; Calderwood, ii. 364</ref>\n\nIn 1568 Lindsay was a commissioner at the York and Westminster conferences discussing the [[casket letters]]. Lindsay heard that [[Lord Herries]] had accused his allies, including [[Regent Moray]], of the murder of [[Henry Stewart, Lord Darnley]]. Lindsay, lodged at [[Kingston upon Thames]], wrote a challenge or [[cartel]] on 22 December 1568, inviting Herries to a duel. Herries, who was in London, sent a reply carried by John Hamilton of Broomiehill. Herries replied that Lindsay had accused Mary of the murder, and he did not know if Lindsay had been involved and had not said so; Herries would fight with Lindsay if he insisted, and would happily fight with any of Lindsay's allies if they cared to write to him. Herries copied the cartel and his reply to the [[Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester|Earl of Leicester]].<ref>Strickland, Agnes, ed., ''Letters of Mary Queen of Scots'', vol.3, Colburn (1843), pp. 267-269: Appendix to Keith's ''History of Scotland''</ref>\n\n===Marian civil war===\nAfter the assassination of Regent Moray in January 1570, Lord Lindsay assisted in carrying the corpse of the Regent Moray at his funeral at St Giles, Edinburgh.<ref>Randolph to Cecil, 22 Feb. 1569\u201370, printed in Knox's ''Works'', vi. 571</ref> Subsequently, during the [[Marian civil war]], he supported the king's party. On 16 June 1571 the forces under him and Morton slew Gavin Hamilton, commendator of Kilwinning, and took Lord Home and others prisoners.<ref>''Diurnal of Occurrents'', p. 224; Calderwood, iii. 101</ref> On the last day of the same month, he also intercepted at Wemyss a quantity of gold sent by order of Queen Mary with [[John Chisholm (soldier)|John Chisholm]] for the defenders of the castle, from her dowry out of France.<ref>''Calendar State Papers Scotland'', vol.3 (1903), pp.478-480, 485-7, 529, 532-3, 535, 620-1, 623-4, 636</ref> Shortly afterwards he was taken prisoner, but on 12 July he purchased his liberty.<ref>Calderwood, iii. 101, 105, 113</ref> A few months later a party of horsemen from Edinburgh went to his estate of the Byres and seized a large number of his cattle,<ref>''Diurnal of Occurrents'', p. 241</ref> but on the following day, Lindsay, in a victorious skirmish with the enemy in the High Street of Edinburgh, took [[Lord Seton]] prisoner.\n\nDuring the absence of the Regent at the parliament at Stirling Lindsay on 23 August was chosen lieutenant in Leith. On 31 August a powerful attack was made upon him, but he drove the enemy back to Edinburgh.<ref>Richard Bannatyne, ''Memorials'', p. 113, 138, 179, 180</ref> In 1572 the king's party elected him [[Provost of Edinburgh]], while the siege of [[Edinburgh castle]] was in progress. Knox, whom he visited on his deathbed, advised him to have no dealings with the \"damnable house of the castle.\"<ref>Calderwood, iii. 235</ref> Lindsay followed this advice until the conclusion of the siege; but after its surrender he made unsuccessful efforts to induce Morton to spare the life of his old companion-in-arms, Kirkcaldy of Grange.\n\n===Under Morton===\nLindsay played a less conspicuous part during the remainder of Morton's regency. In March 1578, he combined with other noblemen to effect Morton's overthrow. It was to Lindsay and Ruthven that the castle of Edinburgh was surrendered on 1 April 1578, and he was chosen one of the council in whom the administration of affairs was vested till the meeting of parliament. When Morton, after regaining possession of the king and the castle of Stirling, summoned a convention to be held there, Lindsay and Montrose, as deputies of the discontented nobles, protested that a convention held in an armed fortress could not be regarded as a free parliament.<ref>''Hist. of James the Sext'', p. 167; Calderwood, iii. 413; Moysie, ''Memoirs'', p. 6</ref> They were imprisoned in their lodgings in Stirling Castle<ref>Reg. P. C. Scotl. iii. 8</ref> but either Lindsay departed without license,<ref>Calderwood, iii. 417</ref> or else his ward was extended to within Fife.<ref>Moysie, Memoirs, p. 13</ref> In any case, he and Montrose joined the dissenting lords, who, with about seven thousand followers, marched in arms towards Stirling. A compromise, by which Morton was permitted nominally to return to power, was effected, and Lindsay became a member of the new privy council. On 1 Dec. 1579 he was appointed a commissioner for the reformation of the [[university of St. Andrews]].<ref>''Register Privy Council Scotl.'', iii. 243</ref> He loyally adhered to Morton till the latter's fall in 1580, when he retired to his own house much discontented. He was involved in the [[Ruthven raid]] in 1582, and after the king's rescue at St. Andrews fled with other raiders to England. On his return he took part in the Gowrie conspiracy in 1584, and was committed to [[Tantallon Castle]], but on the fall of [[James Stewart, Earl of Arran]] in November obtained his release. He died on 11 December 1589.\n\n==Family==\nBy his wife Euphemia Douglas, eldest daughter of Sir Robert Douglas of [[Lochleven Castle|Lochleven]] and [[Margaret Erskine]], and sister uterine of the [[Regent Moray]], he had a son, [[James Lindsay, 7th Lord Lindsay]], and two daughters: Margaret, married to James Leslie, Master of Rothes, and Maulslie, married to William Ballingall of Ballingull. \n\nJames, 7th Lord Lindsay like his father, was a zealous supporter of Protestantism. He was chiefly responsible for the Protestant tumult in the Tolbooth, 17 December 1596, and was fined in large sums of money. He died 5 November 1601. By his wife Euphemia Leslie, eldest daughter of [[Andrew Leslie, 5th Earl of Rothes|Andrew, 5th Earl of Rothes]], he had two sons \u2014 John, 8th Lord Lindsay, and Robert, 9th Lord Lindsay \u2014 and three daughters: Jean, married to Rohert Lundin of Balgony; Catherine, married to John Lundin of Lundin; and Helen, married to John, 2nd Lord Cranston.\n\n==References==\n* [[s:Lindsay, Patrick (d.1589) (DNB00)|Lindsay, Patrick (d.1589) (DNB00)]]\n* ''Register Privy Council Scotland'', vols. i-iii.; Calendar State Papers, For.

In March 1578, he combined with other noblemen to effect Morton's overthrow. It was to Lindsay and Ruthven that the castle of Edinburgh was surrendered on 1 April 1578, and he was chosen one of the council in whom the administration of affairs was vested till the meeting of parliament. When Morton, after regaining possession of the king and the castle of Stirling, summoned a convention to be held there, Lindsay and Montrose, as deputies of the discontented nobles, protested that a convention held in an armed fortress could not be regarded as a free parliament.<ref>''Hist. of James the Sext'', p. 167; Calderwood, iii. 413; Moysie, ''Memoirs'', p. 6</ref> They were imprisoned in their lodgings in Stirling Castle<ref>Reg.

A compromise, by which Morton was permitted nominally to return to power, was effected, and Lindsay became a member of the new privy council. On 1 Dec. 1579 he was appointed a commissioner for the reformation of the [[university of St. Andrews]].<ref>''Register Privy Council Scotl.'', iii. 243</ref> He loyally adhered to Morton till the latter's fall in 1580, when he retired to his own house much discontented. He was involved in the [[Ruthven raid]] in 1582, and after the king's rescue at St. Andrews fled with other raiders to England. On his return he took part in the Gowrie conspiracy in 1584, and was committed to [[Tantallon Castle]], but on the fall of [[James Stewart, Earl of Arran]] in November obtained his release. He died on 11 December 1589.\n\n==Family==\nBy his wife Euphemia Douglas eldest daughter of Sir Robert Douglas of Lochleven, and sister uterine of the Regent Moray, he had a son, James, 7th Lord Lindsay, and two daughters: Margaret, married to James Leslie, Master of Rothes, and Maulslie, married to William Ballingall of Ballingull. \n\n[[James Lindsay, 7th Lord Lindsay]], like his father, was a zealous supporter of Protestantism. He was chiefly responsible for the Protestant tumult in the Tolbooth, 17 December 1596, and was fined in large sums of money. He died 5 November 1601. By his wife Euphemia Leslie, eldest daughter of Andrew, fifth earl of Rothes, he had two sons \u2014 John, eighth lord, and Robert, ninth lord \u2014 and three daughters: Jean, married to Rohert Lundin of Balgony; Catherine, married to John Lundin of Lundin; and Helen, married to John, second lord Cranston.\n\n==References==\n* [[s:Lindsay, Patrick (d.1589) (DNB00)|Lindsay, Patrick (d.1589) (DNB00)]]\n* ''Register Privy Council Scotland'', vols. i-iii.; Calendar State Papers, For.

Out of many designs that were proposed, Udo Krell's design was the first 5\u00d75\u00d75 design that was manufactured and sold. [[Uwe M\u00e8ffert]] manufactured the cube and sold it in [[Hong Kong]] in 1983.\n\n[[Ideal Toy Company|Ideal Toys]] marketed the 5x5x5 cube in [[Germany]] as the \"Rubik's Wahn\" (Wahn meaning delusion or illusion). The 5\u00d75\u00d75 cube got its name when the cube was marketed in [[Japan]] under the name \"Professor's Cube\". M\u00e8ffert reissued the cube under the name \"Professor's Cube\" in the 1990s. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.speedsolving.com/wiki/index.php/5x5x5_Cube|title=5x5x5 Wiki|last=|first=|date=|website=Speedsolving.com|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nEarly versions of the 5\u00d75\u00d75 cube sold at [[Barnes & Noble]] were marketed under the name \"Professor's Cube\" but currently, Barnes and Noble sells cubes that are simply called \"5\u00d75.\" Mefferts.com offers a limited edition version of the 5\u00d75\u00d75 cube called the Professor's Cube.

All non-central pieces have extensions that fit into slots on the outer pieces of the 3\u00d73\u00d73, which keeps them from falling out of the cube while making a turn. The fixed centers have two sections (one visible, one hidden) which can turn independently. This feature is unique to the original design.<ref name=\"Krell patent\">[http://www.freepatentsonline.com/4600199.html United States Patent 4600199]</ref>\n\nThe Eastsheen version of the puzzle uses a different mechanism. The fixed centers hold the centers next to the central edges in place, which in turn hold the outer edges. The non-central edges hold the corners in place, and the internal sections of the corner pieces do not reach the center of the cube.<ref name=\"Eastsheen patent\">[http://www.freepatentsonline.com/6129356.html United States Patent 6129356]</ref>\n\nThe V-Cube 5 mechanism, designed by Panagiotis Verdes, has elements in common with both. The corners reach to the center of the puzzle (like the original mechanism) and the center pieces hold the central edges in place (like the Eastsheen mechanism). The middle edges and center pieces adjacent to them make up the supporting frame and these have extensions which hold the rest of the pieces together. This allows smooth and fast rotation and creating arguably the fastest and most durable version of the puzzle at that time. Unlike the original 5\u00d75\u00d75 design, the V-Cube 5 mechanism was designed to allow [[speedcubing]].<ref name=\"Verdes patent\">[http://www.freepatentsonline.com/y2007/0057455.html United States Patent 20070057455]</ref> Most current production 5\u00d75\u00d75 speed cubes have mechanisms based on Verdes' patent.\n<gallery>\nFile:Professor's Cube disassembled.jpg|A disassembled Professor's Cube\nFile:V-Cube 5 disassembled.jpg|A disassembled V-Cube 5\nFile:Disassembled Eastsheen 5x5x5.jpg|A disassembled Eastsheen cube\n</gallery>\n\n===Durability===\n[[File:5\u00d75\u00d75 misaligned.jpg|thumb|right|150px|This type of center misalignment occurred during a turn and can only occur with the original design.]]\nThe original Professor's Cube is inherently more delicate than the 3\u00d73\u00d73 Rubik's Cube because of the much greater number of moving parts. Because of the fragile design, the Professor's Cube is not suitable for [[speedcubing]]. Applying excessive force to the cube when twisting it may result in broken pieces.<ref>[http://www.rubiks.com/Shop/Products/Rubiks%205x5%20Cube%20Hex%20Packaging.aspx Rubik's 5\u00d75\u00d75 Cube notice section]</ref>  Both the Eastsheen 5\u00d75\u00d75 and the V-Cube 5 are designed with different mechanisms in an attempt to remedy the fragility of the original design.\n\n==Permutations==\nThere are 98 pieces on the exterior of the cube: 8 corners, 36 edges, and 54 centers (48 movable, 6 fixed).\n\nAny [[permutation]] of the corners is possible, including odd permutations, giving [[factorial|8!]] possible arrangements. Seven of the corners can be independently rotated, and the orientation of the eighth depends on the other seven, giving 3<sup>7</sup> (or 2,187) combinations.\n\nThere are 54 centers. Six of these (the center square of each face) are fixed in position. The rest consist of two sets of 24 centers. Within each set there are four centers of each color. Each set can be arranged in 24! different ways. Assuming that the four centers of each color in each set are indistinguishable, the number of permutations of each set is reduced to 24!/(24<sup>6</sup>) arrangements, all of which are possible. The reducing factor comes about because there are 24 (4!) ways to arrange the four pieces of a given color. This is raised to the sixth power because there are six colors. The total number of permutations of all movable centers is the product of the permutations of the two sets, 24!<sup>2</sup>/(24<sup>12</sup>).\n\nThe 24 outer edges cannot be flipped, since the interior shape of those pieces is asymmetrical. Corresponding outer edges are distinguishable, since the pieces are mirror images of each other. Any permutation of the outer edges is possible, including odd permutations, giving 24! arrangements. The 12 central edges can be flipped. Eleven can be flipped and arranged independently, giving 12!/2 \u00d7 2<sup>11</sup> or 12! \u00d7 2<sup>10</sup> possibilities (an odd permutation of the corners implies an odd permutation of the central edges, and vice versa, thus the division by 2). There are 24! \u00d7 12! \u00d7 2<sup>10</sup> possibilities for the inner and outer edges together.\n\nThis gives a total number of permutations of \n:<math>  \\frac{8! \\times 3^7 \\times 12! \\times 2^{10} \\times 24!^3}{24^{12}} \\approx 2.83 \\times 10^{74}</math>\n\nThe full number is precisely 282 870 942 277 741 856 536 180 333 107 150 328 293 127 731 985 672 134 721 536 000 000 000 000 000 possible permutations<ref name=\"Cubic Circular\">[http://www.jaapsch.net/puzzles/cubic3.htm#p18 Cubic Circular Issues 3 & 4] [[David Singmaster]], 1982</ref> (about 283 duodecillion on the [[names of large numbers|long scale]] or 283 tresvigintillion on the short scale).\n\nSome variations of the Professor's Cube have one of the center pieces marked with a logo, which can be put into four different orientations. This increases the number of permutations by a factor of four to 1.13\u00d710<sup>75</sup>, although any orientation of this piece could be regarded as correct. By comparison, the number of atoms in the [[observable universe]] is estimated at about 10<sup>80</sup>. Other variations increase the difficulty by making the orientation of all center pieces visible. An example of this is shown below.\n\n==Solution==\n[[File:Rubik sz\u00e9tszedve.jpg|thumb|right|150px|An original Professor's Cube with many of the pieces removed, showing the 3\u00d73\u00d73 equivalence of the remaining pieces]]\n[[File:3cubes.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Center is an EastSheen 5\u00d75\u00d75 cube with multicolored stickers, which increase difficulty because the centers need to be in correct places.]]\nPeople able to rapidly solve puzzles like this usually favour the reduction method of grouping similar edge pieces into solid strips, and centers into one-colored blocks.  This allows the cube to be quickly solved with the same methods one would use for a 3\u00d73\u00d73 cube. As illustrated to the right, the fixed centers, middle edges and corners can be treated as equivalent to a 3\u00d73\u00d73 cube. As a result, once reduction is complete the parity errors sometimes seen on the 4\u00d74\u00d74 cannot occur on the 5\u00d75\u00d75, or any cube with an odd number of edges for that matter.\n\nAnother frequently used strategy is to solve the edges of the cube first. The corners can be placed just as they are in any previous order of cube puzzle, and the centers are manipulated with an algorithm similar to the one used in the 4\u00d74\u00d74 cube.\n\nA less frequently used strategy is to solve one side and one rim first, then the 2nd, 3rd and 4th rim, and finally the last side and rim. That is, like building a  building. First the basement, then each floor, and finally the roof.<ref>[http://www.rubiks-cube.org Rubiks-Cube.org]</ref>\n\n==World records==\nThe world record fastest 5\u00d75\u00d75 solve is 34.92 seconds, set by [[Max Park]] of the [[United States]] on 25 January, 2020 at Houston Winter 2020, in [[Houston]], [[Texas]].<ref name=\"Official Results - 5x5x5 Cube\">[[World Cube Association]] [https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/results/regions.php?regionId=&eventId=555&years=&mixed=Mixed Official Results - 5x5x5 Cube]</ref>\n\nThe world record for average of five solves (excluding fastest and slowest) is 39.65 seconds, also set by Max Park on 22 June, 2019 at CubingUSA Western Championship 2019 in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]], with the times of 40.34, (36.06), (42.65), 40.82, and 37.80 seconds.<ref name=\"Official Results - 5x5x5 Cube\">[[World Cube Association]] [https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/results/regions.php?regionId=&eventId=555&years=&mixed=Mixed Official Results - 5x5x5 Cube]</ref>\n\nThe record fastest time for solving a 5\u00d75\u00d75 cube blindfolded is 2 minutes, 21.61 seconds (including inspection), set by Stanley Chapel of the United States on 15 December 2019 at Michigan Cubing Club Epsilon 2019  in [[Ann Arbor, Michigan]], [[Michigan]].<ref name=\"Official Results - 5x5x5 Blindfolded\" >[[World Cube Association]] [https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/results/regions.php?regionId=&eventId=555bf&years=&mixed=Mixed Official Results - 5x5x5 Blindfolded]</ref>\n\nThe record for mean of three solves solving a 5x5x5 cube blindfolded is 2 minutes, 27.63 seconds (including inspection), also set by Stanley Chapel of the [[United States]] on 15 December 2019 with the times of 2:32.48, 2:28.80 and 2:21.62<ref name=\"Official Results - 5x5x5 Blindfolded\" >[[World Cube Association]] [https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/results/regions.php?regionId=&eventId=555bf&years=&mixed=Mixed Official Results - 5x5x5 Blindfolded]</ref>\n\n=== Top 5 solvers by single solve<ref>[[World Cube Association]] [https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/results/events.php?eventId=555&regionId=&years=&show=100%2BPersons&single=Single Official 5x5x5 Ranking Single]</ref>===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

The corners reach to the center of the puzzle (like the original mechanism) and the center pieces hold the central edges in place (like the Eastsheen mechanism). The middle edges and center pieces adjacent to them make up the supporting frame and these have extensions which hold the rest of the pieces together. This allows smooth and fast rotation and creating arguably the fastest and most durable version of the puzzle at that time. Unlike the original 5\u00d75\u00d75 design, the V-Cube 5 mechanism was designed to allow [[speedcubing]].<ref name=\"Verdes patent\">[http://www.freepatentsonline.com/y2007/0057455.html United States Patent 20070057455]</ref> Most current production 5\u00d75\u00d75 speed cubes have mechanisms based on Verdes' patent.\n<gallery>\nFile:Professor's Cube disassembled.jpg|A disassembled Professor's Cube\nFile:V-Cube 5 disassembled.jpg|A disassembled V-Cube 5\nFile:Disassembled Eastsheen 5x5x5.jpg|A disassembled Eastsheen cube\n</gallery>\n\n===Durability===\n[[File:5\u00d75\u00d75 misaligned.jpg|thumb|right|150px|This type of center misalignment occurred during a turn and can only occur with the original design.]]\nThe original Professor's Cube is inherently more delicate than the 3\u00d73\u00d73 Rubik's Cube because of the much greater number of moving parts. Because of the fragile design, the Professor's Cube is not suitable for [[speedcubing]]. Applying excessive force to the cube when twisting it may result in broken pieces.<ref>[http://www.rubiks.com/Shop/Products/Rubiks%205x5%20Cube%20Hex%20Packaging.aspx Rubik's 5\u00d75\u00d75 Cube notice section]</ref>  Both the Eastsheen 5\u00d75\u00d75 and the V-Cube 5 are designed with different mechanisms in an attempt to remedy the fragility of the original design.\n\n==Permutations==\nThere are 98 pieces on the exterior of the cube: 8 corners, 36 edges, and 54 centers (48 movable, 6 fixed).\n\nAny [[permutation]] of the corners is possible, including odd permutations, giving [[factorial|8!]] possible arrangements. Seven of the corners can be independently rotated, and the orientation of the eighth depends on the other seven, giving 3<sup>7</sup> (or 2,187) combinations.\n\nThere are 54 centers. Six of these (the center square of each face) are fixed in position. The rest consist of two sets of 24 centers. Within each set there are four centers of each color. Each set can be arranged in 24! different ways. Assuming that the four centers of each color in each set are indistinguishable, the number of permutations of each set is reduced to 24!/(24<sup>6</sup>) arrangements, all of which are possible. The reducing factor comes about because there are 24 (4!) ways to arrange the four pieces of a given color. This is raised to the sixth power because there are six colors. The total number of permutations of all movable centers is the product of the permutations of the two sets, 24!<sup>2</sup>/(24<sup>12</sup>).\n\nThe 24 outer edges cannot be flipped, since the interior shape of those pieces is asymmetrical. Corresponding outer edges are distinguishable, since the pieces are mirror images of each other. Any permutation of the outer edges is possible, including odd permutations, giving 24! arrangements. The 12 central edges can be flipped. Eleven can be flipped and arranged independently, giving 12!/2 \u00d7 2<sup>11</sup> or 12! \u00d7 2<sup>10</sup> possibilities (an odd permutation of the corners implies an odd permutation of the central edges, and vice versa, thus the division by 2). There are 24! \u00d7 12! \u00d7 2<sup>10</sup> possibilities for the inner and outer edges together.\n\nThis gives a total number of permutations of \n:<math>  \\frac{8! \\times 3^7 \\times 12! \\times 2^{10} \\times 24!^3}{24^{12}} \\approx 2.83 \\times 10^{74}</math>\n\nThe full number is precisely 282 870 942 277 741 856 536 180 333 107 150 328 293 127 731 985 672 134 721 536 000 000 000 000 000 possible permutations<ref name=\"Cubic Circular\">[http://www.jaapsch.net/puzzles/cubic3.htm#p18 Cubic Circular Issues 3 & 4] [[David Singmaster]], 1982</ref> (about 283 duodecillion on the [[names of large numbers|long scale]] or 283 tresvigintillion on the short scale).\n\nSome variations of the Professor's Cube have one of the center pieces marked with a logo, which can be put into four different orientations. This increases the number of permutations by a factor of four to 1.13\u00d710<sup>75</sup>, although any orientation of this piece could be regarded as correct. By comparison, the number of atoms in the [[observable universe]] is estimated at about 10<sup>80</sup>. Other variations increase the difficulty by making the orientation of all center pieces visible. An example of this is shown below.\n\n==Solution==\n[[File:Rubik sz\u00e9tszedve.jpg|thumb|right|150px|An original Professor's Cube with many of the pieces removed, showing the 3\u00d73\u00d73 equivalence of the remaining pieces]]\n[[File:3cubes.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Center is an EastSheen 5\u00d75\u00d75 cube with multicolored stickers, which increase difficulty because the centers need to be in correct places.]]\nPeople able to rapidly solve puzzles like this usually favour the reduction method of grouping similar edge pieces into solid strips, and centers into one-colored blocks.  This allows the cube to be quickly solved with the same methods one would use for a 3\u00d73\u00d73 cube. As illustrated to the right, the fixed centers, middle edges and corners can be treated as equivalent to a 3\u00d73\u00d73 cube. As a result, once reduction is complete the parity errors sometimes seen on the 4\u00d74\u00d74 cannot occur on the 5\u00d75\u00d75, or any cube with an odd number of edges for that matter.\n\nAnother frequently used strategy is to solve the edges of the cube first. The corners can be placed just as they are in any previous order of cube puzzle, and the centers are manipulated with an algorithm similar to the one used in the 4\u00d74\u00d74 cube.\n\nA less frequently used strategy is to solve one side and one rim first, then the 2nd, 3rd and 4th rim, and finally the last side and rim. That is, like building a  building. First the basement, then each floor, and finally the roof.<ref>[http://www.rubiks-cube.org Rubiks-Cube.org]</ref>\n\n==World records==\nThe world record fastest 5\u00d75\u00d75 solve is 34,92 seconds, set by [[Max Park]] of the [[United States]] on 25 January, 2020 at Houston Winter 2020, in [[Houston]], [[Texas]].<ref name=\"Official Results - 5x5x5 Cube\">[[World Cube Association]] [https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/results/regions.php?regionId=&eventId=555&years=&mixed=Mixed Official Results - 5x5x5 Cube]</ref>\n\nThe world record for average of five solves (excluding fastest and slowest) is 39.65 seconds, also set by Max Park on 22 June, 2019 at CubingUSA Western Championship 2019 in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]], with the times of 40.34, (36.06), (42.65), 40.82, and 37.80 seconds.<ref name=\"Official Results - 5x5x5 Cube\">[[World Cube Association]] [https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/results/regions.php?regionId=&eventId=555&years=&mixed=Mixed Official Results - 5x5x5 Cube]</ref>\n\nThe record fastest time for solving a 5\u00d75\u00d75 cube blindfolded is 2 minutes, 21.61 seconds (including inspection), set by Stanley Chapel of the United States on 15 December 2019 at Michigan Cubing Club Epsilon 2019  in [[Ann Arbor, Michigan]], [[Michigan]].<ref name=\"Official Results - 5x5x5 Blindfolded\" >[[World Cube Association]] [https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/results/regions.php?regionId=&eventId=555bf&years=&mixed=Mixed Official Results - 5x5x5 Blindfolded]</ref>\n\nThe record for mean of three solves solving a 5x5x5 cube blindfolded is 2 minutes, 27.63 seconds (including inspection), also set by Stanley Chapel of the [[United States]] on 15 December 2019 with the times of 2:32.48, 2:28.80 and 2:21.62<ref name=\"Official Results - 5x5x5 Blindfolded\" >[[World Cube Association]] [https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/results/regions.php?regionId=&eventId=555bf&years=&mixed=Mixed Official Results - 5x5x5 Blindfolded]</ref>\n\n=== Top 5 solvers by single solve<ref>[[World Cube Association]] [https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/results/events.php?eventId=555&regionId=&years=&show=100%2BPersons&single=Single Official 5x5x5 Ranking Single]</ref>===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

His entry into the world of serious [[pop art]] began in his teens when he became an assistant to [[Andy Warhol]] at [[The Factory]] studio. Nicknamed \"SAK\" by Warhol, Kaufman eventually executed such pieces as a 144-foot-long canvas which later toured the country. \n\n==Early life==\nSteve Kaufman was born in 1960 in the [[The Bronx, New York]], the middle child, surrounded by an extended family, many of whom were painters and sculptors that were a significant influence on him and his views on art. His father died when he was four years old. His mother painted high fashion oils on canvas, and he was taught sculpting by his uncles. Kaufman commented on his family, \"They taught me that to be an artist is to be always changing. So I tried all different forms of art and today I have 15 different styles that I work in. Art should always be about changing. A lot of artists will work in one medium their whole career, but I didn't want to ever get bored.

Kaufman graduated from SVA with a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree and held art shows in London.<ref name=KaufmanMuseum/>\n\nIn the late 1980s, Kaufman participated in an AIDS demonstration in order to lock the New York City mayor in his own office, during which he was arrested. Kaufman campaigned for AIDS awareness with art shows featuring 5'x 5' paintings of Trojan condom wrappers. He held a condom art exhibition at Main Fine Art, Edinburgh College of Art, Zanzibar Club and the Smith Gallery.<ref name=KaufmanMuseum/>\n\nLeaving Warhol's Factory, Kaufman established his own SAK Studio, hiring homeless New Yorkers to assist him. He painted portraits of three homeless persons for Transportation Display, Inc. that where later shown in 46 cities on bus billboards, helping to raise $4.72 million to benefit the homeless. Kaufman created the first \u201cRacial Harmony\u201d mural in Harlem to raise attention of inner-city problems. He showed at the White Gallery as a tribute to those who died from AIDS. The \u201cSay Without Art\u201d tribute was based on this show. Kaufman also exhibited his works at the Loft Gallery in Tokyo, Japan.<ref name=KaufmanMuseum/>\n\n===1990s===\nBy the early 1990s, Kaufman's work was highly in demand, but Kaufman wanted to remain in touch with a broad, public audienc4ire staged a one-man, ony|New York subwae-night show. Using four [[New York City Subway]] cars, the sides of abandoned buildings and retaining walls, Kaufman created 55 \u201cRacial Harmony\u201d murals with [[Malcolm X]] images and appears on Fox TV, MTV and radio stations to promote racial tolerance and harmony.  Kaufman presented the Underground Artist of the Year award (1991\u201392). He painted a portrait of [[Mickey Mantle]] to hang in Mantle's restaurant and a portrait of [[Joe Frazier]] to raise money for the [[Police Athletic League]]. Kaugman created the AIDS Memorial in New York City and covered the letter \u201cD\u201d on the [[Hollywood sign]] in red cloth in remembrance of those who have died from AIDS.<ref name=KaufmanMuseum/>\n\nIn 1993, Kaufman moved his studio to [[Los Angeles]] and began painting in a new style he called 'comic book pop art'. He used images of [[Superman]], [[Batman]], [[Spider-Man]] and others. To assist him in his studio, Kaufman hired more than 100 ex-gang members released from prison.<ref name=KaufmanMuseum/>\n\nIn 1995 Kaufman published works for Martin Lawrence Limited Editions, hand-embellishing works including limited editions of [[Beethoven]] and [[Marilyn Monroe]]. He painted portraits of [[Muhammad Ali]] and [[John Travolta]], \"who autographed their editions.\" Becoming the first artist create a bridge between [[Marvel Comics]] (Spiderman) and [[DC Comics]] (Superman), Kaufman worked with comic book artist and creator [[Stan Lee]]. Kaufman, working with parole officers in [[South Central Los Angeles]], hired more than 200 ex-gang-member prison released individuals to assist in the studio and receives an award from Los Angeles Mayor Riordan. According to the Steve Kaufman Museum, Kaufman increased his contributions in 1995 to include 100 different charities.<ref name=KaufmanMuseum/>\n\nIn 1996 Kaufman approached the Sinatra family to gain permission to paint [[Frank Sinatra]]'s image.<ref name=KaufmanMuseum/> Reportedly, the ailing Sinatra ran his frail hands over the completed paintings and nodded his appreciation, tears in his eyes. Kaufman was requested by [[Campbell's]] to paint a limited edition in celebration of Campbell's Soup's 100th anniversary. He paints Muhammad Ali's face on 500 boxing gloves and painted two [[Harley-Davidson]] motorcycles, one with a Campbell's Soup theme and one with a [[Cohiba (cigarette)|Cohiba]] Cigar theme.

He released works such as Sinatra's [[Rat Pack]] and Mug Shot, [[Al Pacino]] as [[The Godfather]] and Scarface, New York City radio personality [[Howard Stern]], [[Barbie]], and two new editions of Marilyn Monroe. Other works included portraits of [[Van Gogh]] and Picasso in a new, 100% hand-painted edition.<ref name=KaufmanMuseum/>\n\n===2000s===\nIn 2001 Kauman continued to support more than 170 charities each year and has hired more than 759 ex-gang members to assist at his studio. Kaufman creates two new painting styles, \u201cportrait collage\u201d and \u201cmuseum art\u201d.  Examples of portrait collage include his works Rat Pack, Hollywood Marilyn, Van Gogh and [[Jackie Kennedy]] in which he added a collage of images to the main portrait. An example of Kaufman's museum art includes the [[September 11 attacks|September 11]] Memorial Painting which was a tribute to the heroes of the World Trade Center attacks. Kaufman created a {{convert|20|x|500|ft}} series of paintings to commemorate the 35-year history of [[Caesar's Palace]] in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]], drawing 10 million visitors in the first 4 months.{{cn|date=November 2019}}\n\nIn 2003 Kaufman suffered a major stroke following Art Expo, New York.<ref name=dostal/> He recovers to show in Las Vegas where he was honored by Mayor [[Oscar Goodman]], the Nevada governor and senator for Steve Kaufman Day on May 31.

For Irish Catholics, the motivation lay largely in memory of British oppression, while their antagonists were dominated by the English Protestant historic fear of papal interference in civil affairs. Because of the vehemence of this quarrel, the [[New York Legislature]] passed the Maclay Act in 1842, giving New York City an elective Board of Education empowered to build and supervise schools and distribute the education fund\u2014but with the proviso that none of the money should go to schools which taught religion.

The majority of them worked in mills, factories, and private households and were considered the bottommost group in the female job hierarchy, alongside African American women. Workers considered mill work in cotton textiles and needle trades the least desirable because of the dangerous and unpleasant conditions. Factory work was primarily a worst-case scenario for widows or daughters of families already involved in the industry.<ref>{{cite book |last=Diner |first=Hasia R. |title=Erin's Daughters |pages=72, 74\u201376}}</ref> Unlike many other immigrants, Irish women preferred domestic work because it was constantly in great demand among middle- and upper-class American households.<ref>{{cite book |last=Diner |first=Hasia R. |title=Erin's Daughters |page=84}}</ref> Although wages differed across the country, they were consistently higher than those of the other occupations available to Irish women and could often be negotiated because of the lack of competition.

Subject to their employers around the clock, Irish women cooked, cleaned, babysat and more. Because most servants lived in the home where they worked, they were separated from their communities. Most of all, the American stigma on domestic work suggested that Irish women were failures who had \"about the same intelligence as that of an old grey-headed negro.\" This quote illustrates how, in a period of extreme [[Racism in the United States|racism]] towards African Americans, society similarly viewed Irish immigrants as inferior beings.<ref>{{cite book| last=Diner| first=Hasia R.| title=Erin's Daughters| page=92}}</ref>\n[[File:Irish immigrants 1909.jpg|thumb|Irish immigrants in [[Kansas City, Missouri]], c. 1909]]\nAlthough the Irish Catholics started very low on the social status scale, by 1900 they had jobs and earnings about equal on average to their neighbors.

In 1897 New York City was formed by consolidating its five boroughs. That created 20,000 new patronage jobs. New York invested heavily in large-scale public works. This produced thousands of unskilled and semi-skilled jobs in subways, street railways, waterworks, and port facilities. Over half the Irish men employed by the city worked in utilities. Across all ethnic groups In New York City, municipal employment grew from  54,000 workers in 1900 to 148,000 in 1930.<ref>{{cite book|author=Roger David Waldinger|title=Still the Promised City?: African-Americans and New Immigrants in Postindustrial New York|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XIX2w_N2fCkC&pg=PA210|year=1999|publisher=Harvard UP|page=210|isbn=9780674000728}}</ref>  In New York City, Albany, and Jersey City, about one third of the Irish of the first and second generation had municipal jobs in 1900.<ref>{{cite book|author=Jessica Trounstine|title=Political Monopolies in American Cities: The Rise and Fall of Bosses and Reformers|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sRI4AAAAQBAJ&pg=PA156|year=2008|publisher=U of Chicago Press|page=156|isbn=9780226812823}}</ref>\n\n====Police====\nBy 1855, according to New York Police Commissioner [[George W.

Teaching was similar to domestic work for the first generation of Irish immigrants in that it was a popular job and one that relied on a woman's decision to remain unmarried.<ref>{{cite book| last=Diner| first=Hasia R.| title=Erin's Daughters |page=96}}</ref> The disproportionate number of Irish-American Catholic women who entered the job market as teachers in the late 19th century and early 20th century from Boston to San Francisco was a beneficial result of the Irish [[National school (Ireland)|National school]] system. Irish schools prepared young single women to support themselves in a new country, which inspired them to instill the importance of education, college training, and a profession in their American-born daughters even more than in their sons. Evidence from schools in New York City illustrate the upward trend of Irish women as teachers: \"as early as 1870, twenty percent of all schoolteachers were Irish women, and...by 1890 Irish females comprised two-thirds of those in the Sixth Ward schools.\" Irish women attained admirable reputations as schoolteachers, which enabled some to pursue professions of even higher stature.<ref>{{cite book| last=Diner| first=Hasia R.| title=Erin's Daughters| pages=97\u201399}}</ref>\n\n====Nuns====\nUpon arrival in the United States, many Irish women became [[nun|Catholic nuns]] and participated in the many American sisterhoods, especially those in [[St. Louis]] in Missouri, [[Saint Paul, Minnesota|St. Paul]] in Minnesota, and [[Troy, New York|Troy]] in New York. Additionally, the women who settled in these communities were often sent back to Ireland to recruit. This kind of religious lifestyle appealed to Irish female immigrants because they outnumbered their male counterparts and the Irish cultural tendency to postpone marriage often promoted gender separation and celibacy.

Dolan, ''The American Catholic Experience'' (1985) p. 228</ref> Rather, intermarriage was primarily with other ethnic groups who shared their religion. Irish Catholics, for example, would commonly intermarry with German Catholics or Poles in the Midwest and Italians in the Northeast.\n\nIrish-American journalists \"scoured the cultural landscape for evidence of insults directed at the Irish in America.\" Much of what historians know about hostility to the Irish comes from their reports in Irish and in Democratic newspapers.<ref>Mick Mulcrone,  \"The Famine Irish and the Irish-American Press: Strangers in a Hostile Land.\" ''American Journalism'' 20#3 (2003) pp 49-72, quote p 62</ref>\n\nWhile the parishes were struggling to build parochial schools, many Catholic children attended public schools.

According to historian George Potter, the media often stereotyped the Irish in America as being boss-controlled, violent (both among themselves and with those of other ethnic groups), voting illegally, prone to [[alcoholism]] and dependent on street gangs that were often violent or criminal. Potter quotes contemporary newspaper images:\n\n<blockquote>You will scarcely ever find an Irishman dabbling in counterfeit money, or breaking into houses, or swindling; but if there is any fighting to be done, he is very apt to have a hand in it.\" Even though Pat might \"'meet with a friend and for love knock him down,'\" noted a [[Montreal]] paper, the fighting usually resulted from a sudden excitement, allowing there was \"but little 'malice prepense' in his whole composition.\" The ''Catholic Telegraph'' of [[Cincinnati]] in 1853, saying that the \"name of 'Irish' has become identified in the minds of many, with almost every species of outlawry,\" distinguished the Irish vices as \"not of a deep malignant nature,\" arising rather from the \"transient burst of undisciplined passion,\" like \"drunk, disorderly, fighting, etc., not like robbery, cheating, swindling, counterfeiting, slandering, calumniating, blasphemy, using obscene language, &c.<ref name=\"potter526\">Potter (1960), p. 526.</ref></blockquote>\n\n[[File:Joseph F. Keppler - Uncle Sam's lodging-house.jpg|thumb|1882 illustration from ''Puck''  depicting Irish immigrants as troublemakers, as compared to those of other nationalities]]\n\nThe Irish had many humorists of their own, but were scathingly attacked in political cartoons, especially those in [[Puck (magazine)|''Puck'']] magazine from the 1870s to 1900; it was edited by secular Germans who opposed the Catholic Irish in politics. In addition, the cartoons of [[Thomas Nast]] were especially hostile; for example, he depicted the Irish-dominated [[Tammany Hall]] machine in New York City as a ferocious tiger.<ref name=\"NDE\">{{cite web| url = http://www.nde.state.ne.us/SS/irish/unit_2.html | title = Irish Famine: Racism | publisher = Nebraska Department of Education | accessdate = 2008-04-14 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080331000610/http://www.nde.state.ne.us/SS/irish/unit_2.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2008-03-31}}</ref>\n\nThe stereotype of the Irish as violent drunks has lasted well beyond its high point in the mid-19th century. For example, President [[Richard Nixon]] once told advisor [[Charles Colson]] that \"[t]he Irish have certain \u2014 for example, the Irish can't drink. What you always have to remember with the Irish is they get mean. Virtually every Irish I've known gets mean when he drinks.

For example, Irish women were sometimes stereotyped as \"reckless breeders\" because some American Protestants feared high Catholic birth rates would eventually result in a Protestant minority. Many native-born Americans claimed that \"their incessant childbearing [would] ensure an Irish political takeover of American cities [and that] Catholicism would become the reigning faith of the hitherto Protestant nation.\"<ref>{{cite book| last=Diner| first=Hasia R.| title=Erin's Daughters| page=62}}</ref> Irish men were also targeted, but in a different way than women were. The difference between the Irish female \"Bridget\" and the Irish male \"Pat\" was distinct; while she was impulsive but fairly harmless, he was \"always drunk, eternally fighting, lazy, and shiftless\". In contrast to the view that Irish women were shiftless, slovenly and stupid (like their male counterparts), girls were said to be \"industrious, willing, cheerful, and honest\u2014they work hard, and they are very strictly moral\".<ref>{{cite web| title=Irish Immigrants in America During the 19th Century| url=http://www.kinsella.org/history/histira.htm| work=The Kinsella Homepage| accessdate=17 April 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite book| last=Whelehan| first=Niall| title=The Dynamiters: Irish Nationalism and Political Violence in the Wider World, 1867-1900| year=2012| location=Cambridge| pages=217\u2013245}}</ref>\n\nThere were also [[Darwinian]]-inspired excuses for the discrimination of the Irish in America. Many Americans believed that since the Irish were [[Celts]] and not [[Anglo-Saxons]], they were racially inferior and deserved second-hand citizenship. The Irish being of inferior intelligence was a belief held by many Americans. This notion was held due to the fact that the Irish topped the charts demographically in terms of arrests and imprisonment. They also had more people confined to [[insane asylum]]s and [[poorhouse]]s than any other group. The racial supremacy belief that many Americans had at the time contributed significantly to Irish discrimination.<ref>{{cite book| last=Casey| first=Marion| title=Making the Irish American: History and Heritage of the Irish in the United States| year=2006| publisher=New York University Press| page=367| url=https://books.google.com/?id=c5TPHakJ98cC&printsec=frontcover&dq=making+the+irish+american#v=onepage&q=making%20the%20irish%20american&f=false| isbn=9780814752081}}</ref>\n\n===Contributions to American culture===\n{{details|List of Irish Americans}}\n{{More citations needed section|date=June 2011}}\n[[File:StPatrickCathedral small.jpg|thumb|upright|[[St. Patrick's Cathedral, New York]]]]\nThe annual celebration of [[Saint Patrick's Day]] is a widely recognized symbol of the Irish presence in America. The largest celebration of the holiday takes place in New York, where the annual St. Patrick's Day Parade draws an average of two million people. The second-largest celebration is held in Boston. The South Boston Parade is one the nation's oldest, dating back to 1737. [[Savannah, Georgia]], also holds one of the largest parades in the United States.\n\nSince the arrival of nearly two million Irish immigrants in the 1840s, the urban Irish police officer and firefighter have become virtual icons of American popular culture. In many large cities, the police and fire departments have been dominated by the Irish for over 100 years, even after the ethnic Irish residential populations in those cities dwindled to small minorities. Many police and fire departments maintain large and active \"[[Emerald Society|Emerald Societies]]\", bagpipe marching groups, or other similar units demonstrating their members' pride in their Irish heritage.\n\nWhile these archetypal images are especially well known, Irish Americans have contributed to U.S. culture in a wide variety of fields: the fine and performing arts, film, literature, politics, sports, and religion. The Irish-American contribution to popular entertainment is reflected in the careers of figures such as [[James Cagney]], [[Bing Crosby]], [[Walt Disney]], [[John Ford]], [[Judy Garland]],<ref>Flynn, John & Jerry Kelleher.

More recently, the Irish-born [[Pierce Brosnan]] gained screen celebrity as [[James Bond]]. During the early years of television, popular figures with Irish roots included [[Gracie Allen]], [[Art Carney]], [[Joe Flynn (US actor)|Joe Flynn]], [[Jackie Gleason]], [[Luke Gordon]] and [[Ed Sullivan]].\n\nSince the late days of the film industry, celluloid representations of Irish Americans have been plentiful. Famous films with Irish-American themes include social dramas such as ''[[Little Nellie Kelly]]'' and ''[[The Cardinal]]'', labor epics like ''[[On the Waterfront]]'', and gangster movies such as ''[[Angels with Dirty Faces]]'', ''[[The Friends of Eddie Coyle]]'', and ''[[The Departed]]''. Irish-American characters have been featured in popular television series such as ''[[Ryan's Hope]]'', ''[[Rescue Me (U.S. TV series)|Rescue Me]]'' and ''[[Blue Bloods (TV series)|Blue Bloods]]''.\n\nProminent Irish-American literary figures include [[Pulitzer Prize|Pulitzer]] and [[Nobel Prize]]\u2013winning playwright [[Eugene O'Neill]], [[Jazz Age]] novelist [[F. Scott Fitzgerald]], author and poet [[Edgar Allan Poe]],<ref>Arthur Hobson Quinn, 'Edgar Allan Poe: a critical biography' (1997), p. 13</ref> social realist [[James T. Farrell]], and [[Southern Gothic]] writer [[Flannery O'Connor]]. The 19th-century novelist [[Henry James]] was also of partly Irish descent. While Irish Americans have been underrepresented in the plastic arts, two well-known American painters claim Irish roots. 20th-century painter [[Georgia O'Keeffe]] was born to an Irish-American father, and 19th-century [[trompe-l'\u0153il]] painter [[William Harnett]] emigrated from Ireland to the United States.\n\nThe Irish-American contribution to politics spans the entire ideological spectrum. Two prominent American socialists, [[Mary Harris Jones|Mary Harris \"Mother\" Jones]] and [[Elizabeth Gurley Flynn]], were Irish Americans. In the 1960s, Irish-American writer [[Michael Harrington]] became an influential advocate of social welfare programs. Harrington's views profoundly influenced President [[John F. Kennedy]] and his brother, [[Robert F. Kennedy]]. Meanwhile, Irish-American political writer [[William F. Buckley]] emerged as a major intellectual force in [[American conservative]] politics in the latter half of the 20th century. Buckley's magazine, ''[[National Review]]'', proved an effective advocate of successful [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] candidates such as [[Ronald Reagan]].\n\nNotorious Irish Americans include the legendary New Mexico outlaw [[Billy the Kid]].<ref name=\"wallis6\">Wallis (2007), p. 6.</ref><ref name=\"utley2\">Utley (1989), p. 2.</ref> Many historians believe he was born in New York City to Famine-era immigrants from Ireland.<ref name=\"wallis6\" /><ref name=\"utley2\" /> [[Mary Mallon]], also known as ''Typhoid Mary'', was an Irish immigrant, as was [[Procuring (prostitution)|madam]] [[Josephine Airey]], who also went by the name of \"Chicago Joe\" Hensley.

Such groups include New York City's [[Black 47]], founded in the late 1980s, blending [[punk rock]], [[rock and roll]], [[Irish music]], rap/[[hip hop music|hip-hop]], [[reggae]], and [[soul music|soul]]; and the [[Dropkick Murphys]], a Celtic punk band formed in [[Quincy, Massachusetts]], nearly a decade later. [[The Decemberists]], a band featuring Irish-American singer [[Colin Meloy]], released \"Shankill Butchers\", a song that deals with the [[Ulster loyalism|Ulster Loyalist]] [[Shankill Butchers|gang of the same name]]. The song appears on their album ''[[The Crane Wife]]''.

As a result, Scotch-Irish became the customary term to describe Protestants of Irish descent...

For Irish Catholics, the motivation lay largely in memory of British oppression, while their antagonists were dominated by the English Protestant historic fear of papal interference in civil affairs. Because of the vehemence of this quarrel, the [[New York Legislature]] passed the Maclay Act in 1842, giving New York City an elective Board of Education empowered to build and supervise schools and distribute the education fund\u2014but with the proviso that none of the money should go to schools which taught religion.

The majority of them worked in mills, factories, and private households and were considered the bottommost group in the female job hierarchy, alongside African American women. Workers considered mill work in cotton textiles and needle trades the least desirable because of the dangerous and unpleasant conditions. Factory work was primarily a worst-case scenario for widows or daughters of families already involved in the industry.<ref>{{cite book |last=Diner |first=Hasia R. |title=Erin's Daughters |pages=72, 74\u201376}}</ref> Unlike many other immigrants, Irish women preferred domestic work because it was constantly in great demand among middle- and upper-class American households.<ref>{{cite book |last=Diner |first=Hasia R. |title=Erin's Daughters |page=84}}</ref> Although wages differed across the country, they were consistently higher than those of the other occupations available to Irish women and could often be negotiated because of the lack of competition.

Subject to their employers around the clock, Irish women cooked, cleaned, babysat and more. Because most servants lived in the home where they worked, they were separated from their communities. Most of all, the American stigma on domestic work suggested that Irish women were failures who had \"about the same intelligence as that of an old grey-headed negro.\" This quote illustrates how, in a period of extreme [[Racism in the United States|racism]] towards African Americans, society similarly viewed Irish immigrants as inferior beings.<ref>{{cite book| last=Diner| first=Hasia R.| title=Erin's Daughters| page=92}}</ref>\n[[File:Irish immigrants 1909.jpg|thumb|Irish immigrants in [[Kansas City, Missouri]], c. 1909]]\nAlthough the Irish Catholics started very low on the social status scale, by 1900 they had jobs and earnings about equal on average to their neighbors.

In 1897 New York City was formed by consolidating its five boroughs. That created 20,000 new patronage jobs. New York invested heavily in large-scale public works. This produced thousands of unskilled and semi-skilled jobs in subways, street railways, waterworks, and port facilities. Over half the Irish men employed by the city worked in utilities. Across all ethnic groups In New York City, municipal employment grew from  54,000 workers in 1900 to 148,000 in 1930.<ref>{{cite book|author=Roger David Waldinger|title=Still the Promised City?: African-Americans and New Immigrants in Postindustrial New York|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XIX2w_N2fCkC&pg=PA210|year=1999|publisher=Harvard UP|page=210|isbn=9780674000728}}</ref>  In New York City, Albany, and Jersey City, about one third of the Irish of the first and second generation had municipal jobs in 1900.<ref>{{cite book|author=Jessica Trounstine|title=Political Monopolies in American Cities: The Rise and Fall of Bosses and Reformers|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sRI4AAAAQBAJ&pg=PA156|year=2008|publisher=U of Chicago Press|page=156|isbn=9780226812823}}</ref>\n\n====Police====\nBy 1855, according to New York Police Commissioner [[George W.

Teaching was similar to domestic work for the first generation of Irish immigrants in that it was a popular job and one that relied on a woman's decision to remain unmarried.<ref>{{cite book| last=Diner| first=Hasia R.| title=Erin's Daughters |page=96}}</ref> The disproportionate number of Irish-American Catholic women who entered the job market as teachers in the late 19th century and early 20th century from Boston to San Francisco was a beneficial result of the Irish [[National school (Ireland)|National school]] system. Irish schools prepared young single women to support themselves in a new country, which inspired them to instill the importance of education, college training, and a profession in their American-born daughters even more than in their sons. Evidence from schools in New York City illustrate the upward trend of Irish women as teachers: \"as early as 1870, twenty percent of all schoolteachers were Irish women, and...by 1890 Irish females comprised two-thirds of those in the Sixth Ward schools.\" Irish women attained admirable reputations as schoolteachers, which enabled some to pursue professions of even higher stature.<ref>{{cite book| last=Diner| first=Hasia R.| title=Erin's Daughters| pages=97\u201399}}</ref>\n\n====Nuns====\nUpon arrival in the United States, many Irish women became [[nun|Catholic nuns]] and participated in the many American sisterhoods, especially those in [[St. Louis]] in Missouri, [[Saint Paul, Minnesota|St. Paul]] in Minnesota, and [[Troy, New York|Troy]] in New York. Additionally, the women who settled in these communities were often sent back to Ireland to recruit. This kind of religious lifestyle appealed to Irish female immigrants because they outnumbered their male counterparts and the Irish cultural tendency to postpone marriage often promoted gender separation and celibacy. Furthermore, \"the Catholic church, clergy, and women religious were highly respected in Ireland,\" making the sisterhoods particularly attractive to Irish immigrants.<ref>{{cite book| last=Coburn| first=Carol K.| title=Spirited Lives: How Nuns Shaped Catholic Culture and American Life, 1836\u20131920| url=https://archive.org/details/spiritedliveshow3620cobu| url-access=registration| year=1999| publisher=The University of North Carolina Press| location=Chapel Hill| pages=[https://archive.org/details/spiritedliveshow3620cobu/page/87 87\u201389]}}</ref> Nuns provided extensive support for Irish immigrants in large cities, especially in fields such as nursing and teaching but also through orphanages, widows' homes, and housing for young, single women in domestic work.<ref>{{cite book| last=Coburn| first=Carol K.| title=Spirited Lives| pages=210\u2013211}}</ref> Although many Irish communities built parish schools run by nuns, the majority of Irish parents in large cities in the East enrolled their children in the public school system, where daughters or granddaughters of Irish immigrants had already established themselves as teachers.<ref>{{cite book| last=Coburn| first=Carol K.| title=Spirited Lives| pages=140\u2013141}}</ref>\n\n===Discrimination===\n[[File:No Irish Need Apply (lyric sheet).jpg|thumb|upright|1862 song that used the \"No Irish Need Apply\" slogan.

Dolan, ''The American Catholic Experience'' (1985) p. 228</ref> Rather, intermarriage was primarily with other ethnic groups who shared their religion. Irish Catholics, for example, would commonly intermarry with German Catholics or Poles in the Midwest and Italians in the Northeast.\n\nIrish-American journalists \"scoured the cultural landscape for evidence of insults directed at the Irish in America.\" Much of what historians know about hostility to the Irish comes from their reports in Irish and in Democratic newspapers.<ref>Mick Mulcrone,  \"The Famine Irish and the Irish-American Press: Strangers in a Hostile Land.\" ''American Journalism'' 20#3 (2003) pp 49-72, quote p 62</ref>\n\nWhile the parishes were struggling to build parochial schools, many Catholic children attended public schools.

According to historian George Potter, the media often stereotyped the Irish in America as being boss-controlled, violent (both among themselves and with those of other ethnic groups), voting illegally, prone to [[alcoholism]] and dependent on street gangs that were often violent or criminal. Potter quotes contemporary newspaper images:\n\n<blockquote>You will scarcely ever find an Irishman dabbling in counterfeit money, or breaking into houses, or swindling; but if there is any fighting to be done, he is very apt to have a hand in it.\" Even though Pat might \"'meet with a friend and for love knock him down,'\" noted a [[Montreal]] paper, the fighting usually resulted from a sudden excitement, allowing there was \"but little 'malice prepense' in his whole composition.\" The ''Catholic Telegraph'' of [[Cincinnati]] in 1853, saying that the \"name of 'Irish' has become identified in the minds of many, with almost every species of outlawry,\" distinguished the Irish vices as \"not of a deep malignant nature,\" arising rather from the \"transient burst of undisciplined passion,\" like \"drunk, disorderly, fighting, etc., not like robbery, cheating, swindling, counterfeiting, slandering, calumniating, blasphemy, using obscene language, &c.<ref name=\"potter526\">Potter (1960), p. 526.</ref></blockquote>\n\n[[File:Joseph F. Keppler - Uncle Sam's lodging-house.jpg|thumb|1882 illustration from ''Puck''  depicting Irish immigrants as troublemakers, as compared to those of other nationalities]]\n\nThe Irish had many humorists of their own, but were scathingly attacked in political cartoons, especially those in [[Puck (magazine)|''Puck'']] magazine from the 1870s to 1900; it was edited by secular Germans who opposed the Catholic Irish in politics. In addition, the cartoons of [[Thomas Nast]] were especially hostile; for example, he depicted the Irish-dominated [[Tammany Hall]] machine in New York City as a ferocious tiger.<ref name=\"NDE\">{{cite web| url = http://www.nde.state.ne.us/SS/irish/unit_2.html | title = Irish Famine: Racism | publisher = Nebraska Department of Education | accessdate = 2008-04-14 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080331000610/http://www.nde.state.ne.us/SS/irish/unit_2.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2008-03-31}}</ref>\n\nThe stereotype of the Irish as violent drunks has lasted well beyond its high point in the mid-19th century. For example, President [[Richard Nixon]] once told advisor [[Charles Colson]] that \"[t]he Irish have certain \u2014 for example, the Irish can't drink. What you always have to remember with the Irish is they get mean. Virtually every Irish I've known gets mean when he drinks.

For example, Irish women were sometimes stereotyped as \"reckless breeders\" because some American Protestants feared high Catholic birth rates would eventually result in a Protestant minority. Many native-born Americans claimed that \"their incessant childbearing [would] ensure an Irish political takeover of American cities [and that] Catholicism would become the reigning faith of the hitherto Protestant nation.\"<ref>{{cite book| last=Diner| first=Hasia R.| title=Erin's Daughters| page=62}}</ref> Irish men were also targeted, but in a different way than women were. The difference between the Irish female \"Bridget\" and the Irish male \"Pat\" was distinct; while she was impulsive but fairly harmless, he was \"always drunk, eternally fighting, lazy, and shiftless\". In contrast to the view that Irish women were shiftless, slovenly and stupid (like their male counterparts), girls were said to be \"industrious, willing, cheerful, and honest\u2014they work hard, and they are very strictly moral\".<ref>{{cite web| title=Irish Immigrants in America During the 19th Century| url=http://www.kinsella.org/history/histira.htm| work=The Kinsella Homepage| accessdate=17 April 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite book| last=Whelehan| first=Niall| title=The Dynamiters: Irish Nationalism and Political Violence in the Wider World, 1867-1900| year=2012| location=Cambridge| pages=217\u2013245}}</ref>\n\nThere were also [[Darwinian]]-inspired excuses for the discrimination of the Irish in America. Many Americans believed that since the Irish were [[Celts]] and not [[Anglo-Saxons]], they were racially inferior and deserved second-hand citizenship. The Irish being of inferior intelligence was a belief held by many Americans. This notion was held due to the fact that the Irish topped the charts demographically in terms of arrests and imprisonment. They also had more people confined to [[insane asylum]]s and [[poorhouse]]s than any other group. The racial supremacy belief that many Americans had at the time contributed significantly to Irish discrimination.<ref>{{cite book| last=Casey| first=Marion| title=Making the Irish American: History and Heritage of the Irish in the United States| year=2006| publisher=New York University Press| page=367| url=https://books.google.com/?id=c5TPHakJ98cC&printsec=frontcover&dq=making+the+irish+american#v=onepage&q=making%20the%20irish%20american&f=false| isbn=9780814752081}}</ref>\n\n===Contributions to American culture===\n{{details|List of Irish Americans}}\n{{More citations needed section|date=June 2011}}\n[[File:StPatrickCathedral small.jpg|thumb|upright|[[St. Patrick's Cathedral, New York]]]]\nThe annual celebration of [[Saint Patrick's Day]] is a widely recognized symbol of the Irish presence in America. The largest celebration of the holiday takes place in New York, where the annual St. Patrick's Day Parade draws an average of two million people. The second-largest celebration is held in Boston. The South Boston Parade is one the nation's oldest, dating back to 1737. [[Savannah, Georgia]], also holds one of the largest parades in the United States.\n\nSince the arrival of nearly two million Irish immigrants in the 1840s, the urban Irish police officer and firefighter have become virtual icons of American popular culture. In many large cities, the police and fire departments have been dominated by the Irish for over 100 years, even after the ethnic Irish residential populations in those cities dwindled to small minorities. Many police and fire departments maintain large and active \"[[Emerald Society|Emerald Societies]]\", bagpipe marching groups, or other similar units demonstrating their members' pride in their Irish heritage.\n\nWhile these archetypal images are especially well known, Irish Americans have contributed to U.S. culture in a wide variety of fields: the fine and performing arts, film, literature, politics, sports, and religion. The Irish-American contribution to popular entertainment is reflected in the careers of figures such as [[James Cagney]], [[Bing Crosby]], [[Walt Disney]], [[John Ford]], [[Judy Garland]],<ref>Flynn, John & Jerry Kelleher.

More recently, the Irish-born [[Pierce Brosnan]] gained screen celebrity as [[James Bond]]. During the early years of television, popular figures with Irish roots included [[Gracie Allen]], [[Art Carney]], [[Joe Flynn (US actor)|Joe Flynn]], [[Jackie Gleason]], [[Luke Gordon]] and [[Ed Sullivan]].\n\nSince the late days of the film industry, celluloid representations of Irish Americans have been plentiful. Famous films with Irish-American themes include social dramas such as ''[[Little Nellie Kelly]]'' and ''[[The Cardinal]]'', labor epics like ''[[On the Waterfront]]'', and gangster movies such as ''[[Angels with Dirty Faces]]'', ''[[The Friends of Eddie Coyle]]'', and ''[[The Departed]]''. Irish-American characters have been featured in popular television series such as ''[[Ryan's Hope]]'', ''[[Rescue Me (U.S. TV series)|Rescue Me]]'' and ''[[Blue Bloods (TV series)|Blue Bloods]]''.\n\nProminent Irish-American literary figures include [[Pulitzer Prize|Pulitzer]] and [[Nobel Prize]]\u2013winning playwright [[Eugene O'Neill]], [[Jazz Age]] novelist [[F. Scott Fitzgerald]], author and poet [[Edgar Allan Poe]],<ref>Arthur Hobson Quinn, 'Edgar Allan Poe: a critical biography' (1997), p. 13</ref> social realist [[James T. Farrell]], and [[Southern Gothic]] writer [[Flannery O'Connor]]. The 19th-century novelist [[Henry James]] was also of partly Irish descent. While Irish Americans have been underrepresented in the plastic arts, two well-known American painters claim Irish roots. 20th-century painter [[Georgia O'Keeffe]] was born to an Irish-American father, and 19th-century [[trompe-l'\u0153il]] painter [[William Harnett]] emigrated from Ireland to the United States.\n\nThe Irish-American contribution to politics spans the entire ideological spectrum. Two prominent American socialists, [[Mary Harris Jones|Mary Harris \"Mother\" Jones]] and [[Elizabeth Gurley Flynn]], were Irish Americans. In the 1960s, Irish-American writer [[Michael Harrington]] became an influential advocate of social welfare programs. Harrington's views profoundly influenced President [[John F. Kennedy]] and his brother, [[Robert F. Kennedy]]. Meanwhile, Irish-American political writer [[William F. Buckley]] emerged as a major intellectual force in [[American conservative]] politics in the latter half of the 20th century. Buckley's magazine, ''[[National Review]]'', proved an effective advocate of successful [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] candidates such as [[Ronald Reagan]].\n\nNotorious Irish Americans include the legendary New Mexico outlaw [[Billy the Kid]].<ref name=\"wallis6\">Wallis (2007), p. 6.</ref><ref name=\"utley2\">Utley (1989), p. 2.</ref> Many historians believe he was born in New York City to Famine-era immigrants from Ireland.<ref name=\"wallis6\" /><ref name=\"utley2\" /> [[Mary Mallon]], also known as ''Typhoid Mary'', was an Irish immigrant, as was [[Procuring (prostitution)|madam]] [[Josephine Airey]], who also went by the name of \"Chicago Joe\" Hensley.

Such groups include New York City's [[Black 47]], founded in the late 1980s, blending [[punk rock]], [[rock and roll]], [[Irish music]], rap/[[hip hop music|hip-hop]], [[reggae]], and [[soul music|soul]]; and the [[Dropkick Murphys]], a Celtic punk band formed in [[Quincy, Massachusetts]], nearly a decade later. [[The Decemberists]], a band featuring Irish-American singer [[Colin Meloy]], released \"Shankill Butchers\", a song that deals with the [[Ulster loyalism|Ulster Loyalist]] [[Shankill Butchers|gang of the same name]]. The song appears on their album ''[[The Crane Wife]]''.

The content of each account provides comprehensive information for each species. The topics that are covered include identification, distribution and habitat, foraging and reproductive behavior, the conservation status of the species, and the author's suggestions for the highest priorities for future research on that species. Also provided are a map of the distribution of the species and, when available, photographs of the species, its habitat, and of the nest and eggs.
