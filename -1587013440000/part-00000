{"title_page": "Subtraction", "text_new": "{{short description|One of the four basic arithmetic operations}}\n{{refimprove|date=May 2018}}\n[[File:Subtraction01.svg|right|thumb|180px|\"{{nowrap|5 \u2212 2}} = 3\" (verbally, \"five minus two equals three\")]]\n[[File:Vertical subtraction example.svg|right|thumb|180px|An example problem]]\n[[File:Shop placard showing 20% reduction.JPG|thumb|Placard outside a shop in [[Bordeaux]] advertising subtraction of 20% from the price of a second perfume.]]\n'''Subtraction''' is an [[arithmetic operation]] that represents the operation of removing objects from a collection. The result of a subtraction is called a '''difference'''. Subtraction is signified by the [[minus sign]] (\u2212). For example, in the adjacent picture, there are {{nowrap|5 \u2212 2}} apples\u2014meaning 5 apples with 2 taken away, which is a total of 3 apples. Therefore, the ''difference'' of 5 and 2 is 3, that is, {{nowrap|1=5 \u2212 2 = 3}}. Subtraction represents removing or decreasing physical and abstract quantities using different kinds of objects including [[negative number]]s, [[Fraction (mathematics)|fractions]], [[irrational number]]s, [[Euclidean vector|vectors]], decimals, functions, and matrices.\n\nSubtraction follows several important patterns. It is [[anticommutative]], meaning that changing the order changes the sign of the answer. It is also not [[associativity|associative]], meaning that when one subtracts more than two numbers, the order in which subtraction is performed matters. Because {{num|0}} is the [[additive identity]], subtraction of it does not change a number. Subtraction also obeys predictable rules concerning related operations such as [[addition]] and [[multiplication]]. All of these rules can be [[mathematical proof|proven]], starting with the subtraction of [[integers]] and generalizing up through the [[real number]]s and beyond. General [[binary operations]] that continue these patterns are studied in [[abstract algebra]].\n\nPerforming subtraction is one of the simplest numerical tasks. Subtraction of very small numbers is accessible to young children. In [[primary education]], students are taught to subtract numbers in the [[decimal]] system, starting with single digits and progressively tackling more difficult problems.\n\nIn advanced algebra and in [[computer algebra]], an expression involving subtraction like {{nowrap|''A'' \u2212 ''B''}} is generally treated as a shorthand notation for the addition {{nowrap|''A'' + (\u2212''B'')}}. Thus, {{nowrap|''A'' \u2212 ''B''}} contains two terms, namely ''A'' and \u2212''B''. This allows an easier use of [[associativity]] and [[commutativity]].\n\n==Notation and terminology==\n[[File:Subtraction chart.png|thumb|180px|Subtraction of numbers 0\u201310. Line labels = minuend. X axis = subtrahend. Y axis = difference.]]\nSubtraction is written using the [[Plus and minus signs|minus sign]] \"\u2212\" between the terms; that is, in [[infix notation]]. The result is expressed with an [[equals sign]]. For example,\n:<math>2 - 1 = 1 </math> (verbally, \"two minus one equals one\")\n:<math>4 - 2 = 2 </math> (verbally, \"four minus two equals two\")\n:<math>6 - 3 = 3 </math> (verbally, \"six minus three equals three\")\n:<math>4 - 6 = -2 </math> (verbally, \"four minus six equals negative two\")\n\nThere are also situations where subtraction is \"understood\" even though no symbol appears:\n* A column of two numbers, with the lower number in red, usually indicates that the lower number in the column is to be subtracted, with the difference written below, under a line. This is most common in accounting.\n\nFormally, the number being subtracted is known as the ''subtrahend'',<ref name=\"Schmid_1974\">{{cite book |title=Decimal Computation |first=Hermann |last=Schmid<!--General Electric Company, Binghamton, NY--> |author-link=Hermann Schmid (computer scientist) |date=1974 |edition=1 |publisher=[[John Wiley & Sons]] |location=Binghamton, NY |isbn=978-0-471-76180-8 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/decimalcomputati0000schm }}</ref><ref name=\"Schmid_1983\">{{cite book |title=Decimal Computation |first=Hermann |last=Schmid<!--General Electric Company, Binghamton, NY--> |author-link=Hermann Schmid (computer scientist) |orig-year=1974 |date=1983 |edition=1 (reprint) |publisher=Robert E. Krieger Publishing Company |location=Malabar, FL |isbn=978-0-89874-318-0}}</ref> while the number it is subtracted from is the ''minuend''.<ref name=\"Schmid_1974\"/><ref name=\"Schmid_1983\"/> The result is the ''difference''.<ref name=\"Schmid_1974\"/><ref name=\"Schmid_1983\"/>\n\nAll of this terminology derives from [[Latin]]. \"[[wikt:subtraction|Subtraction]]\" is an [[English language|English]] word derived from the Latin [[verb]] ''subtrahere'', which is in turn a [[compound (linguistics)|compound]] of ''sub'' \"from under\" and ''trahere'' \"to pull\"; thus to ''subtract'' is to ''draw from below, take away''.<ref>{{OED|Subtraction}}</ref> Using the [[gerundive]] [[Affix|suffix]] ''-nd'' results in \"subtrahend\", \"thing to be subtracted\".<ref group=lower-alpha>\"Subtrahend\" is shortened by the inflectional Latin suffix -us, e.g. remaining un-declined as in ''numerus subtrahendus'' \"the number to be subtracted\".</ref> Likewise from ''minuere'' \"to reduce or diminish\", one gets \"minuend\", \"thing to be diminished\".\n\n==Of integers and real numbers==\n===Integers===\n[[File:Line Segment jaredwf.svg|left| ]]\nImagine a [[line segment]] of [[length]] ''b'' with the left end labeled ''a'' and the right end labeled ''c''.\nStarting from ''a'', it takes ''b'' steps to the right to reach ''c''. This movement to the right is modeled mathematically by [[addition]]:\n:''a'' + ''b'' = ''c''.\n\nFrom ''c'', it takes ''b'' steps to the ''left'' to get back to ''a''. This movement to the left is modeled by subtraction:\n:''c'' \u2212 ''b'' = ''a''.\n\n[[File:Subtraction line segment.svg|left| ]]\nNow, a line segment labeled with the numbers {{num|1}}, {{num|2}}, and {{num|3}}. From position 3, it takes no steps to the left to stay at 3, so {{nowrap|1=3 \u2212 0 = 3}}. It takes 2 steps to the left to get to position 1, so {{nowrap|1=3 \u2212 2 = 1}}. This picture is inadequate to describe what would happen after going 3 steps to the left of position 3. To represent such an operation, the line must be extended.\n\nTo subtract arbitrary [[natural number]]s, one begins with a line containing every natural number (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, ...). From 3, it takes 3 steps to the left to get to 0, so {{nowrap|1=3 \u2212 3 = 0}}. But {{nowrap|3 \u2212 4}} is still invalid since it again leaves the line. The natural numbers are not a useful context for subtraction.\n\nThe solution is to consider the [[integer]] [[number line]] (..., \u22123, \u22122, \u22121, 0, 1, 2, 3, ...). From 3, it takes 4 steps to the left to get to \u22121:\n:{{nowrap|1=3 \u2212 4 = \u22121}}.\n\n===Natural numbers===\nSubtraction of [[natural numbers]] is not [[Closure (mathematics)|closed]]. The difference is not a natural number unless the minuend is greater than or equal to the subtrahend. For example, 26 cannot be subtracted from 11 to give a natural number. Such a case uses one of two approaches:\n# Say that 26 cannot be subtracted from 11; subtraction becomes a [[partial function]].\n# Give the answer as an [[integer]] representing a [[negative number]], so the result of subtracting 26 from 11 is \u221215.\n\n===Real numbers===\nSubtraction of real numbers is defined as addition of signed numbers. Specifically, a number is subtracted by adding its [[additive inverse]]. Then we have {{nowrap|1=3 \u2212 \u03c0 = 3 + (\u2212\u03c0)}}. This helps to keep the [[ring (mathematics)|ring]] of real numbers \"simple\" by avoiding the introduction of \"new\" operators such as subtraction. Ordinarily a ring only has two operations defined on it; in the case of the integers, these are addition and multiplication. A ring already has the concept of additive inverses, but it does not have any notion of a separate subtraction operation, so the use of signed addition as subtraction allows us to apply the ring axioms to subtraction without needing to prove anything.\n\n==Properties==\n===Anticommutativity===\nSubtraction is [[anti-commutative]], meaning that if one reverses the terms in a difference left-to-right, the result is the negative of the original result. Symbolically, if ''a'' and ''b'' are any two numbers, then\n:''a'' \u2212 ''b'' = \u2212(''b'' \u2212 ''a)''.\n\n===Non-associativity===\nSubtraction is [[associativity|non-associative]], which comes up when one tries to define repeated subtraction. Should the expression\n:\"''a'' \u2212 ''b'' \u2212 ''c''\"\nbe defined to mean (''a'' \u2212 ''b'') \u2212 ''c'' or ''a'' \u2212 (''b'' \u2212 ''c'')? These two possibilities give different answers. To resolve this issue, one must establish an [[order of operations]], with different orders giving different results.\n\n===Predecessor===\nIn the context of integers, subtraction of [[1 (number)|one]] also plays a special role: for any integer ''a'', the integer {{nowrap|(''a'' \u2212 1)}} is the largest integer less than ''a'', also known as the predecessor of ''a''.\n\n==Units of measurement==\nWhen subtracting two numbers with units of measurement such as kilograms or pounds, they must have the same unit. In most cases the difference will have the same unit as the original numbers.\n\n===Percentages===\nChanges in [[percentage]]s can be reported in at least two forms, [[percentage change]] and [[percentage point]] change. Percentage change represents the [[relative change]] between the two quantities as a percentage, while [[percentage point]] change is simply the number obtained by subtracting the two percentages.<ref>Paul E. Peterson, Michael Henderson, Martin R. West (2014) ''Teachers Versus the Public: What Americans Think about Schools and How to Fix Them'' Brookings Institution Press, p. 163</ref><ref>Janet Kolodzy (2006) ''Convergence Journalism: Writing and Reporting across the News Media'' Rowman & Littlefield Publishers, p. 180</ref><ref>David Gillborn (2008) ''Racism and Education: Coincidence Or Conspiracy?'' Routledge p. 46</ref>\n\nAs an example, suppose that 30% of widgets made in a factory are defective. Six months later, 20% of widgets are defective. The percentage change is {{sfrac|\u221233|1|3}}%, while the percentage point change is \u221210 percentage points.\n\n==In computing==\nThe [[method of complements]] is a technique used to subtract one number from another using only addition of positive numbers. This method was commonly used in [[mechanical calculator]]s and is still used in modern [[computers]].\n\n{| class=\"wikitable floatright\"\n! Binary<br>digit\n! Ones' <br>complement\n|-align=\"center\"\n| 0\n| 1\n|-align=\"center\"\n| 1\n| 0\n|}\nTo subtract a binary number ''y'' (the subtrahend) from another number ''x'' (the minuend), the ones' complement of ''y'' is added to ''x'' and one is added to the sum. The leading digit \"1\" of the result is then discarded.\n\nThe method of complements is especially useful in binary (radix 2) since the ones' complement is very easily obtained by inverting each bit (changing \"0\" to \"1\" and vice versa). And adding 1 to get the two's complement can be done by simulating a carry into the least significant bit. For example:\n\n   01100100  (x, equals decimal 100)\n - 00010110  (y, equals decimal 22)\n\nbecomes the sum:\n\n   01100100  (x)\n + 11101001  (ones' complement of y)\n +        1  (to get the two's complement)\n \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  101001110\n\nDropping the initial \"1\" gives the answer: 01001110 (equals decimal 78)\n\n==The teaching of subtraction in schools==\nMethods used to teach subtraction to [[elementary school]] vary from country to country, and within a country, different methods are in fashion at different times. In what is, in the United States, called [[traditional mathematics]], a specific process is taught to students at the end of the 1st&nbsp;year or during the 2nd&nbsp;year for use with multi-digit whole numbers, and is extended in either the fourth or fifth grade to include decimal representations of fractional numbers.\n\n===In America===\nAlmost all American schools currently teach a method of subtraction using borrowing or regrouping (the decomposition algorithm) and a system of markings called crutches.<ref name=\"Klapper1916\">{{cite book |author=Paul Klapper |title=The Teaching of Arithmetic: A Manual for Teachers |url=https://archive.org/details/teachingarithme00klapgoog |year=1916 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/teachingarithme00klapgoog/page/n94 80]\u2013 |access-date=2016-03-11 }}</ref><ref>Susan Ross and Mary Pratt-Cotter. 2000. \"Subtraction in the United States:  An Historical Perspective,\" ''The Mathematics Educator'' 8(1):4\u201311. p. 8: \"This new version of the decomposition algorithm [i.e., using Brownell's crutch] has so completely dominated the field that it is rare to see any other algorithm used to teach subtraction today [in America].\"</ref> Although a method of borrowing had been known and published in textbooks previously, the use of crutches in American schools spread after [[William A.

There is no borrowing in this method. There are also crutches (markings to aid memory), which vary by country.<ref>Klapper 1916, pp. 177\u2013.</ref><ref name=\"Smith1913\">{{cite book |author=David Eugene Smith |title=The Teaching of Arithmetic |url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_A7NJAAAAIAAJ |year=1913 |publisher=Ginn |pages=[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_A7NJAAAAIAAJ/page/n85 77]\u2013 |access-date=2016-03-11 }}</ref>\n\n===Comparing the two main methods===\nBoth these methods break up the subtraction as a process of one digit subtractions by place value. Starting with a least significant digit, a subtraction of subtrahend:\n:''s''<sub>''j''</sub> ''s''<sub>''j''\u22121</sub> ... ''s''<sub>1</sub>\nfrom minuend\n:''m''<sub>''k''</sub> ''m''<sub>''k''\u22121</sub> ... ''m''<sub>1</sub>,\nwhere each ''s''<sub>''i''</sub> and ''m''<sub>''i''</sub> is a digit, proceeds by writing down {{nowrap|''m''<sub>1</sub> \u2212 ''s''<sub>1</sub>}}, {{nowrap|''m''<sub>2</sub> \u2212 ''s''<sub>2</sub>}}, and so forth, as long as ''s''<sub>''i''</sub> does not exceed ''m''<sub>''i''</sub>. Otherwise, ''m''<sub>''i''</sub> is increased by 10 and some other digit is modified to correct for this increase. The American method corrects by attempting to decrease the minuend digit ''m''<sub>''i''+1</sub> by one (or continuing the borrow leftwards until there is a non-zero digit from which to borrow). The European method corrects by increasing the subtrahend digit ''s''<sub>''i''+1</sub> by one.\n\n'''Example:''' 704 \u2212 512.\n\n{{equation|\n   \\begin{array}{rrrr}\n        & \\color{Red}-1 \\\\\n        & C & D & U  \\\\\n        & 7 & 0 & 4 \\\\   \n        & 5 & 1 & 2 \\\\\n      \\hline\n        & 1 & 9 & 2 \\\\\n   \\end{array}\n   \\begin{array}{l}\n       { \\color{Red}\\longleftarrow \\rm carry }\\\\\n       \\\\\n       \\longleftarrow \\; \\rm Minuend\\\\\n       \\longleftarrow \\; \\rm Subtrahend\\\\\n       \\longleftarrow \\rm{Rest \\; or \\; Difference}\\\\\n   \\end{array}\n}}\n\nThe minuend is 704, the subtrahend is 512. The minuend digits are {{nowrap|1=''m''<sub>3</sub> = 7}}, {{nowrap|1=''m''<sub>2</sub> = 0}} and {{nowrap|1=''m''<sub>1</sub> = 4}}. The subtrahend digits are {{nowrap|1=''s''<sub>3</sub> = 5}}, {{nowrap|1=''s''<sub>2</sub> = 1}} and {{nowrap|1=''s''<sub>1</sub> = 2}}. Beginning at the one's place, 4 is not less than 2 so the difference 2 is written down in the result's one's place. In the ten's place, 0 is less than 1, so the 0 is increased by 10, and the difference with 1, which is 9, is written down in the ten's place. The American method corrects for the increase of ten by reducing the digit in the minuend's hundreds place by one. That is, the 7 is struck through and replaced by a 6. The subtraction then proceeds in the hundreds place, where 6 is not less than 5, so the difference is written down in the result's hundred's place. We are now done, the result is 192.\n\nThe Austrian method does not reduce the 7 to 6. Rather it increases the subtrahend hundred's digit by one. A small mark is made near or below this digit (depending on the school). Then the subtraction proceeds by asking what number when increased by 1, and 5 is added to it, makes 7. The answer is 1, and is written down in the result's hundred's place.\n\nThere is an additional subtlety in that the student always employs a mental subtraction table in the American method. The Austrian method often encourages the student to mentally use the addition table in reverse. In the example above, rather than adding 1 to 5, getting 6, and subtracting that from 7, the student is asked to consider what number, when increased by 1, and 5 is added to it, makes 7.\n\n==Subtraction by hand==\n===Austrian method===\nExample:\n<gallery>\nFile:Vertical Subtraction Method B Step 1.JPG|1 + ... = 3\nFile:Vertical Subtraction Method B Step 2.JPG|The difference is written under the line.\nFile:Vertical Subtraction Method B Step 3.JPG|9 + ... = 5<br>The required sum (5) is too small.\nFile:Vertical Subtraction Method B Step 4.JPG|So, we add 10 to it and put a 1 under the next higher place in the subtrahend.\nFile:Vertical Subtraction Method B Step 5.JPG|9 + ... = 15<br>Now we can find the difference like before.\nFile:Vertical Subtraction Method B Step 6.JPG|(4 + 1) + ... = 7\nFile:Vertical Subtraction Method B Step 7.JPG|The difference is written under the line.\nFile:Vertical Subtraction Method B Step 8.JPG|The total difference.\n</gallery>\n\n===Subtraction from left to right===\nExample:\n<gallery>\nFile:LeftToRight Subtraction Step 1.JPG|7 \u2212 4 = 3<br>This result is only penciled in.\nFile:LeftToRight Subtraction Step 2.JPG|Because the next digit of the minuend is smaller than the subtrahend, we subtract one from our penciled-in-number and mentally add ten to the next.\nFile:LeftToRight Subtraction Step 3.JPG|15 \u2212 9 = 6\nFile:LeftToRight Subtraction Step 4.JPG|Because the next digit in the minuend is not smaller than the subtrahend, We keep this number.\nFile:LeftToRight Subtraction Step 5.JPG|3 \u2212 1 = 2\n</gallery>\n\n===American method===\nIn this method, each digit of the subtrahend is subtracted from the digit above it starting from right to left.

The result of a subtraction is called a '''difference'''. Subtraction is signified by the [[minus sign]] (\u2212). For example, in the adjacent picture, there are {{nowrap|5 \u2212 2}} apples\u2014meaning 5 apples with 2 taken away, which is a total of 3 apples. Therefore, the ''difference'' of 5 and 2 is 3, that is, {{nowrap|1=5 \u2212 2 = 3}}. Subtraction represents removing or decreasing physical and abstract quantities using different kinds of objects including [[negative number]]s, [[Fraction (mathematics)|fractions]], [[irrational number]]s, [[Euclidean vector|vectors]], decimals, functions, and matrices.\n\nSubtraction follows several important patterns. It is [[anticommutative]], meaning that changing the order changes the sign of the answer. It is also not [[associativity|associative]], meaning that when one subtracts more than two numbers, the order in which subtraction is performed matters. Because {{num|0}} is the [[additive identity]], subtraction of it does not change a number. Subtraction also obeys predictable rules concerning related operations such as [[addition]] and [[multiplication]]. All of these rules can be [[mathematical proof|proven]], starting with the subtraction of [[integers]] and generalizing up through the [[real number]]s and beyond. General [[binary operations]] that continue these patterns are studied in [[abstract algebra]].\n\nPerforming subtraction is one of the simplest numerical tasks. Subtraction of very small numbers is accessible to young children. In [[primary education]], students are taught to subtract numbers in the [[decimal]] system, starting with single digits and progressively tackling more difficult problems.\n\nIn advanced algebra and in [[computer algebra]], an expression involving subtraction like {{nowrap|''A'' \u2212 ''B''}} is generally treated as a shorthand notation for the addition {{nowrap|''A'' + (\u2212''B'')}}. Thus, {{nowrap|''A'' \u2212 ''B''}} contains two terms, namely ''A'' and \u2212''B''. This allows an easier use of [[associativity]] and [[commutativity]].\n\n==Notation and terminology==\n[[File:Subtraction chart.png|thumb|180px|Subtraction of numbers 0\u201310. Line labels = minuend. X axis = subtrahend. Y axis = difference.]]\nSubtraction is written using the [[Plus and minus signs|minus sign]] \"\u2212\" between the terms; that is, in [[infix notation]]. The result is expressed with an [[equals sign]]. For example,\n:<math>2 - 1 = 1 </math> (verbally, \"two minus one equals one\")\n:<math>4 - 2 = 2 </math> (verbally, \"four minus two equals two\")\n:<math>6 - 3 = 3 </math> (verbally, \"six minus three equals three\")\n:<math>4 - 6 = -2 </math> (verbally, \"four minus six equals negative two\")\n\nThere are also situations where subtraction is \"understood\" even though no symbol appears:\n* A column of two numbers, with the lower number in red, usually indicates that the lower number in the column is to be subtracted, with the difference written below, under a line. This is most common in accounting.\n\nFormally, the number being subtracted is known as the ''subtrahend'',<ref name=\"Schmid_1974\">{{cite book |title=Decimal Computation |first=Hermann |last=Schmid<!--General Electric Company, Binghamton, NY--> |author-link=Hermann Schmid (computer scientist) |date=1974 |edition=1 |publisher=[[John Wiley & Sons]] |location=Binghamton, NY |isbn=978-0-471-76180-8 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/decimalcomputati0000schm }}</ref><ref name=\"Schmid_1983\">{{cite book |title=Decimal Computation |first=Hermann |last=Schmid<!--General Electric Company, Binghamton, NY--> |author-link=Hermann Schmid (computer scientist) |orig-year=1974 |date=1983 |edition=1 (reprint) |publisher=Robert E.

This movement to the right is modeled mathematically by [[addition]]:\n:''a'' + ''b'' = ''c''.\n\nFrom ''c'', it takes ''b'' steps to the ''left'' to get back to ''a''. This movement to the left is modeled by subtraction:\n:''c'' \u2212 ''b'' = ''a''.\n\n[[File:Subtraction line segment.svg|left| ]]\nNow, a line segment labeled with the numbers {{num|1}}, {{num|2}}, and {{num|3}}. From position 3, it takes no steps to the left to stay at 3, so {{nowrap|1=3 \u2212 0 = 3}}. It takes 2 steps to the left to get to position 1, so {{nowrap|1=3 \u2212 2 = 1}}. This picture is inadequate to describe what would happen after going 3 steps to the left of position 3. To represent such an operation, the line must be extended.\n\nTo subtract arbitrary [[natural number]]s, one begins with a line containing every natural number (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, ...). From 3, it takes 3 steps to the left to get to 0, so {{nowrap|1=3 \u2212 3 = 0}}. But {{nowrap|3 \u2212 4}} is still invalid since it again leaves the line. The natural numbers are not a useful context for subtraction.\n\nThe solution is to consider the [[integer]] [[number line]] (..., \u22123, \u22122, \u22121, 0, 1, 2, 3, ...). From 3, it takes 4 steps to the left to get to \u22121:\n:{{nowrap|1=3 \u2212 4 = \u22121}}.\n\n===Natural numbers===\nSubtraction of [[natural numbers]] is not [[Closure (mathematics)|closed]]. The difference is not a natural number unless the minuend is greater than or equal to the subtrahend. For example, 26 cannot be subtracted from 11 to give a natural number. Such a case uses one of two approaches:\n# Say that 26 cannot be subtracted from 11; subtraction becomes a [[partial function]].\n# Give the answer as an [[integer]] representing a [[negative number]], so the result of subtracting 26 from 11 is \u221215.\n\n===Real numbers===\nSubtraction of real numbers is defined as addition of signed numbers. Specifically, a number is subtracted by adding its [[additive inverse]]. Then we have {{nowrap|1=3 \u2212 \u03c0 = 3 + (\u2212\u03c0)}}. This helps to keep the [[ring (mathematics)|ring]] of real numbers \"simple\" by avoiding the introduction of \"new\" operators such as subtraction. Ordinarily a ring only has two operations defined on it; in the case of the integers, these are addition and multiplication. A ring already has the concept of additive inverses, but it does not have any notion of a separate subtraction operation, so the use of signed addition as subtraction allows us to apply the ring axioms to subtraction without needing to prove anything.\n\n==Properties==\n===Anticommutativity===\nSubtraction is [[anti-commutative]], meaning that if one reverses the terms in a difference left-to-right, the result is the negative of the original result. Symbolically, if ''a'' and ''b'' are any two numbers, then\n:''a'' \u2212 ''b'' = \u2212(''b'' \u2212 ''a)''.\n\n===Non-associativity===\nSubtraction is [[associativity|non-associative]], which comes up when one tries to define repeated subtraction. Should the expression\n:\"''a'' \u2212 ''b'' \u2212 ''c''\"\nbe defined to mean (''a'' \u2212 ''b'') \u2212 ''c'' or ''a'' \u2212 (''b'' \u2212 ''c'')? These two possibilities give different answers. To resolve this issue, one must establish an [[order of operations]], with different orders giving different results.\n\n===Predecessor===\nIn the context of integers, subtraction of [[1 (number)|one]] also plays a special role: for any integer ''a'', the integer {{nowrap|(''a'' \u2212 1)}} is the largest integer less than ''a'', also known as the predecessor of ''a''.\n\n==Units of measurement==\nWhen subtracting two numbers with units of measurement such as kilograms or pounds, they must have the same unit. In most cases the difference will have the same unit as the original numbers.\n\n===Percentages===\nChanges in [[percentage]]s can be reported in at least two forms, [[percentage change]] and [[percentage point]] change. Percentage change represents the [[relative change]] between the two quantities as a percentage, while [[percentage point]] change is simply the number obtained by subtracting the two percentages.<ref>Paul E. Peterson, Michael Henderson, Martin R. West (2014) ''Teachers Versus the Public: What Americans Think about Schools and How to Fix Them'' Brookings Institution Press, p. 163</ref><ref>Janet Kolodzy (2006) ''Convergence Journalism: Writing and Reporting across the News Media'' Rowman & Littlefield Publishers, p. 180</ref><ref>David Gillborn (2008) ''Racism and Education: Coincidence Or Conspiracy?'' Routledge p. 46</ref>\n\nAs an example, suppose that 30% of widgets made in a factory are defective. Six months later, 20% of widgets are defective. The percentage change is {{sfrac|\u221233|1|3}}%, while the percentage point change is \u221210 percentage points.\n\n==In computing==\nThe [[method of complements]] is a technique used to subtract one number from another using only addition of positive numbers. This method was commonly used in [[mechanical calculator]]s and is still used in modern [[computers]].\n\n{| class=\"wikitable floatright\"\n! Binary<br>digit\n! Ones' <br>complement\n|-align=\"center\"\n| 0\n| 1\n|-align=\"center\"\n| 1\n| 0\n|}\nTo subtract a binary number ''y'' (the subtrahend) from another number ''x'' (the minuend), the ones' complement of ''y'' is added to ''x'' and one is added to the sum. The leading digit \"1\" of the result is then discarded.\n\nThe method of complements is especially useful in binary (radix 2) since the ones' complement is very easily obtained by inverting each bit (changing \"0\" to \"1\" and vice versa). And adding 1 to get the two's complement can be done by simulating a carry into the least significant bit. For example:\n\n   01100100  (x, equals decimal 100)\n - 00010110  (y, equals decimal 22)\n\nbecomes the sum:\n\n   01100100  (x)\n + 11101001  (ones' complement of y)\n +        1  (to get the two's complement)\n \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  101001110\n\nDropping the initial \"1\" gives the answer: 01001110 (equals decimal 78)\n\n==The teaching of subtraction in schools==\nMethods used to teach subtraction to [[elementary school]] vary from country to country, and within a country, different methods are in fashion at different times. In what is, in the United States, called [[traditional mathematics]], a specific process is taught to students at the end of the 1st&nbsp;year or during the 2nd&nbsp;year for use with multi-digit whole numbers, and is extended in either the fourth or fifth grade to include decimal representations of fractional numbers.\n\n===In America===\nAlmost all American schools currently teach a method of subtraction using borrowing or regrouping (the decomposition algorithm) and a system of markings called crutches.<ref name=\"Klapper1916\">{{cite book |author=Paul Klapper |title=The Teaching of Arithmetic: A Manual for Teachers |url=https://archive.org/details/teachingarithme00klapgoog |year=1916 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/teachingarithme00klapgoog/page/n94 80]\u2013 |access-date=2016-03-11 }}</ref><ref>Susan Ross and Mary Pratt-Cotter. 2000. \"Subtraction in the United States:  An Historical Perspective,\" ''The Mathematics Educator'' 8(1):4\u201311. p. 8: \"This new version of the decomposition algorithm [i.e., using Brownell's crutch] has so completely dominated the field that it is rare to see any other algorithm used to teach subtraction today [in America].\"</ref> Although a method of borrowing had been known and published in textbooks previously, the use of crutches in American schools spread after [[William A.

Starting with a least significant digit, a subtraction of subtrahend:\n:''s''<sub>''j''</sub> ''s''<sub>''j''\u22121</sub> ... ''s''<sub>1</sub>\nfrom minuend\n:''m''<sub>''k''</sub> ''m''<sub>''k''\u22121</sub> ... ''m''<sub>1</sub>,\nwhere each ''s''<sub>''i''</sub> and ''m''<sub>''i''</sub> is a digit, proceeds by writing down {{nowrap|''m''<sub>1</sub> \u2212 ''s''<sub>1</sub>}}, {{nowrap|''m''<sub>2</sub> \u2212 ''s''<sub>2</sub>}}, and so forth, as long as ''s''<sub>''i''</sub> does not exceed ''m''<sub>''i''</sub>. Otherwise, ''m''<sub>''i''</sub> is increased by 10 and some other digit is modified to correct for this increase. The American method corrects by attempting to decrease the minuend digit ''m''<sub>''i''+1</sub> by one (or continuing the borrow leftwards until there is a non-zero digit from which to borrow). The European method corrects by increasing the subtrahend digit ''s''<sub>''i''+1</sub> by one.\n\n'''Example:''' 704 \u2212 512.\n\n{{equation|\n   \\begin{array}{rrrr}\n        & \\color{Red}-1 \\\\\n        & C & D & U  \\\\\n        & 7 & 0 & 4 \\\\   \n        & 5 & 1 & 2 \\\\\n      \\hline\n        & 1 & 9 & 2 \\\\\n   \\end{array}\n   \\begin{array}{l}\n       { \\color{Red}\\longleftarrow \\rm carry }\\\\\n       \\\\\n       \\longleftarrow \\; \\rm Minuend\\\\\n       \\longleftarrow \\; \\rm Subtrahend\\\\\n       \\longleftarrow \\rm{Rest \\; or \\; Difference}\\\\\n   \\end{array}\n}}\n\nThe minuend is 704, the subtrahend is 512.

Beginning at the one's place, 4 is not less than 2 so the difference 2 is written down in the result's one's place. In the ten's place, 0 is less than 1, so the 0 is increased by 10, and the difference with 1, which is 9, is written down in the ten's place. The American method corrects for the increase of ten by reducing the digit in the minuend's hundreds place by one. That is, the 7 is struck through and replaced by a 6. The subtraction then proceeds in the hundreds place, where 6 is not less than 5, so the difference is written down in the result's hundred's place. We are now done, the result is 192.\n\nThe Austrian method does not reduce the 7 to 6. Rather it increases the subtrahend hundred's digit by one. A small mark is made near or below this digit (depending on the school). Then the subtraction proceeds by asking what number when increased by 1, and 5 is added to it, makes 7. The answer is 1, and is written down in the result's hundred's place.\n\nThere is an additional subtlety in that the student always employs a mental subtraction table in the American method. The Austrian method often encourages the student to mentally use the addition table in reverse. In the example above, rather than adding 1 to 5, getting 6, and subtracting that from 7, the student is asked to consider what number, when increased by 1, and 5 is added to it, makes 7.\n\n==Subtraction by hand==\n===Austrian method===\nExample:\n<gallery>\nFile:Vertical Subtraction Method B Step 1.JPG|1 + ... = 3\nFile:Vertical Subtraction Method B Step 2.JPG|The difference is written under the line.\nFile:Vertical Subtraction Method B Step 3.JPG|9 + ... = 5<br>The required sum (5) is too small.\nFile:Vertical Subtraction Method B Step 4.JPG|So, we add 10 to it and put a 1 under the next higher place in the subtrahend.\nFile:Vertical Subtraction Method B Step 5.JPG|9 + ... = 15<br>Now we can find the difference like before.\nFile:Vertical Subtraction Method B Step 6.JPG|(4 + 1) + ... = 7\nFile:Vertical Subtraction Method B Step 7.JPG|The difference is written under the line.\nFile:Vertical Subtraction Method B Step 8.JPG|The total difference.\n</gallery>\n\n===Subtraction from left to right===\nExample:\n<gallery>\nFile:LeftToRight Subtraction Step 1.JPG|7 \u2212 4 = 3<br>This result is only penciled in.\nFile:LeftToRight Subtraction Step 2.JPG|Because the next digit of the minuend is smaller than the subtrahend, we subtract one from our penciled-in-number and mentally add ten to the next.\nFile:LeftToRight Subtraction Step 3.JPG|15 \u2212 9 = 6\nFile:LeftToRight Subtraction Step 4.JPG|Because the next digit in the minuend is not smaller than the subtrahend, We keep this number.\nFile:LeftToRight Subtraction Step 5.JPG|3 \u2212 1 = 2\n</gallery>\n\n===American method===\nIn this method, each digit of the subtrahend is subtracted from the digit above it starting from right to left. If the top number is too small to subtract the bottom number from it, we add 10 to it; this 10 is \"borrowed\" from the top digit to the left, which we subtract 1 from. Then we move on to subtracting the next digit and borrowing as needed, until every digit has been subtracted.\nExample:\n<gallery>\nFile:Vertical Subtraction Method A Step 1.JPG|3 \u2212 1 = ...\nFile:Vertical Subtraction Method A Step 2.JPG|We write the difference under the line.\nFile:Vertical Subtraction Method A Step 3.JPG|5 \u2212 9 = ...<br> The minuend (5) is too small!\nFile:Vertical Subtraction Method A Step 4.JPG|So, we add 10 to it.

Certainly a tape of part or all of ''Spunk'' had been played to [[Tony Parsons (British journalist)|Tony Parsons]] as early as March 1977, and became the subject of his ''[[NME]]'' article, \"Blank Nuggets in the UK\", which described the recordings as if they represented an imminent debut album release.<ref name = \"Heylin\"/>\n\n== Reissues ==\nThe original ''Spunk'' was itself copied and bootlegged immediately upon release. The tracks have since been re-bootlegged countless times in many different formats, including a widespread variant called ''No Future UK?'', which added three extra tracks, and many releases by Dave Goodman, which often feature evidence of remixing.<ref name = \"Heylin\"/>\n\n''Spunk'' has also been the subject of several official releases.\n\nVirgin Records released the whole of ''Spunk'', without the talking between tracks, along with several other early Sex Pistols demos as part of a limited edition double-CD reissue of ''Never Mind the Bollocks'' in 1996 called ''[[Spunk/This Is Crap]]''.\n\n''Spunk'' was released on 17 July 2006 by [[Sanctuary Records]] in its original vinyl format (CMQLP1395, limited to 1,000 copies). The CD version (CMRCD1376) included the three bonus tracks from the original ''No Future UK?'' bootleg.\n\nA Venezuelan bootleg album, ''Smilin' Ears'', features the same tracks, except additional track of intro to \"No Future\" at the beginning of album. It is unnamed, consisting of \"Nookie\" backing speech of band members. The words spoken by [[Johnny Rotten]] are \"I don't have any heroes, they're all useless.  I don't need a Rolls Royce, I don't need a house in the country, I don't need a villa in the south of France.  I'm happy as I am an' I'm gonna carry on\".

The album also features the bass-lines of Glen Matlock, which were not reproduced when guitarist [[Steve Jones (musician)|Steve Jones]] took over bass duties for the recording of ''Never Mind the Bollocks''.<ref>{{cite book | title = [[Classic Albums]]: Never Mind The Bollocks, Here's The Sex Pistols | year = 2002 | publisher = Isis/Eagle Rock Entertainment}}</ref>\n\n''Spunk'' is therefore often cited as the Sex Pistols' de facto alternative debut album. Certainly a tape of part or all of ''Spunk'' had been played to [[Tony Parsons (British journalist)|Tony Parsons]] as early as March 1977, and became the subject of his ''[[NME]]'' article, \"Blank Nuggets in the UK\", which described the recordings as if they represented an imminent debut album release.<ref name = \"Heylin\"/>\n\n== Reissues ==\nThe original ''Spunk'' was itself copied and bootlegged immediately upon release. The tracks have since been re-bootlegged countless times in many different formats, including a widespread variant called ''No Future UK?'', which added three extra tracks, and many releases by Dave Goodman, which often feature evidence of remixing.<ref name = \"Heylin\"/>\n\n''Spunk'' has also been the subject of several official releases.\n\nVirgin Records released the whole of ''Spunk'', without the talking between tracks, along with several other early Sex Pistols demos as part of a limited edition double-CD reissue of ''Never Mind the Bollocks'' in 1996 called ''[[Spunk/This Is Crap]]''.\n\n''Spunk'' was released on 17 July 2006 by [[Sanctuary Records]] in its original vinyl format (CMQLP1395, limited to 1,000 copies). The CD version (CMRCD1376) included the three bonus tracks from the original ''No Future UK?'' bootleg.\n\nA Venezuelan bootleg album, ''Smilin' Ears'', features the same tracks, except additional track of intro to \"No Future\" at the beginning of album. It is unnamed, consisting of \"Nookie\" backing speech of band members. The words spoken by [[Johnny Rotten]] are \"I don't have any heroes, they're all useless.  I don't need a Rolls Royce, I don't need a house in the country, I don't need a villa in the south of France.  I'm happy as I am an' I'm gonna carry on\". The recording was taken from a 1976 edition of the London Weekend Show hosted by [[Janet Street-Porter]], which documented the rise of punk rock.\n\n==Track listing==\nAll songs written by the Sex Pistols, all songs on the original bootleg album were simply credited to \"Spunk\".

Born in [[Port Colborne]], Ontario, he played for the [[Boston Bruins]]. Gallinger was one of the league's youngest players when he broke into the NHL, playing on the \"Sprout Line\" of Boston with [[Bill Shill]] and [[Bep Guidolin]]. Gallinger's career was cut short, when in 1948 Gallinger and former team-mate Billy Taylor were discovered gambling on their own teams and banned for life by the NHL. They were reinstated in 1970 and these are the longest suspensions in NHL history. Prior to the suspension, Gallinger had established himself an effective offensive NHL player and, as an excellent multi-sport athlete, had even been sought after to play professional baseball.\n\n==Career==\nDon Gallinger came from a hockey family. Gallinger's father, Frank, was a lacrosse player, but also played hockey in the Northern Hockey League.

However, gambling was also a problem in professional hockey. In 1946, the NHL had discovered a betting ring operating in [[Maple Leaf Gardens]] in Toronto. [[Babe Pratt]], a star player with Toronto, was suspended for nine games for betting on his own team. When the betting problem still continued into the next season, the NHL made it clear that any more infractions would receive more severe punishment.<ref name=\"Wright\"/>\n\nGallinger had gambled on the Bruins from the time of his rookie year, although he later insisted he never bet on Boston to lose until he met [[Billy Taylor (ice hockey b. 1919)|Billy Taylor]].<ref name=\"Keene\">Keene p. 62</ref> Taylor, a 28-year-old center, had arrived to the Bruins in a trade to start the 1947\u201348 season and was living in the same boarding house as Gallinger.

In February 1948, Gallinger phoned Tamer before a game in Chicago. The conversation was recorded by a wiretap on Tamer's phone. The conversation as reported in a Detroit newspaper:\n\nTamer: How are things going tonight?\n\nVoice: Don't worry about the game tonight... I don't intend to do so good. Bet $500 for me.<ref name=\"Wright\">Wright p.248</ref>\n\nGallinger also told Tamer that the Bruins would be without [[Milt Schmidt]] in the game. Tamer in turn phoned Taylor in New York to bet $500 on Boston to lose. Although the Bruins won the game against Chicago,  Detroit police informed NHL President [[Clarence Campbell]] of the wire taps.\n\nIn late February, Gallinger was visiting his family in Port Colborne when he received a call to come to Toronto to be questioned concerning the Detroit gambler. On the train ride to Toronto, Gallinger made the decision he would deny everything to save his father the disgrace. In Toronto, the general manager of the Bruins, [[Art Ross]], was questioning all the Boston players one-by-one. When it was his turn, Ross told Gallinger he knew he was involved, but Gallinger continued to insist on his innocence. Art Ross then personally approached Gallinger's father and proposed the idea of his son seeing a [[Problem gambling|psychiatrist]] in Toronto. When his father told him of the idea, Gallinger refused. Years later, Gallinger stated that he regretted the decision as in retrospect he realized that Ross was looking for a way to defend him.<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=The Globe and Mail|location=Toronto|last=Young|first=Scott|date=Jan 29, 1963|title=Gallinger Grilled at Length by Ross and Campbell Before Suspension|page=34}}</ref>\n\nEarly in March 1948, word of a gambling scandal involving some Boston Bruin players made its way into the press. The players involved had not yet been named.\n\nOn March 3, The Bruins were playing the Chicago Blackhawks at the Boston Garden in their first game since news of the scandal became public. The Boston fans cheered loudly as the Bruin players skated onto the ice. Old-time followers of the Bruins compared the reception to the last time Boston had won the Stanley Cup in 1939. Boston was down 4\u20131 going into the third period, but rallied to tie the game. With the game at 4\u20133, Don Gallinger brought the puck down the ice, skillfully getting past at least three Blackhawks players in the process, and passed the puck to Johnny Peirson, who scored his first NHL goal to tie the game.<ref>{{cite news|title=Bruins Give Fine Reception By Boston Fans|agency=Associated Press|newspaper=Nashua Telegraph|location=Nashua, NH|date=March 4, 1948|page=21}}</ref>\n\nOn March 4, 1948, [[Walter Winchell]] named Gallinger as one of the players involved in the gambling scandal. The same day, Montreal sportswriter Dink Carroll spoke with Gallinger after the game between Boston and Montreal. \"You probably know what this is about, don't you?\" Carroll asks. \"Yes, you want to know if I've made any decision about baseball,\" Gallinger answered. Carroll informed Gallinger that Winchell had just named him as the Boston player involved. \"Winchell\", said Gallinger. \"Do you mean the fellow in New York?\" Initially Gallinger appeared too bewildered to comment, but eventually denied the accusations.<ref>{{cite news|last=Carroll|first=Dink|title=Playing the Field|page=10|newspaper=The Gazette|location=Montreal|date=March 6, 1948}}</ref>\n\nOn Sunday, March 7, the Bruins were playing the Toronto Maple Leafs in Boston. In the second period, Gallinger intercepted a [[Gus Mortson]] clearing pass and let go with a low 30-foot shot past goaltender [[Turk Broda]].

The boy was born in 1947 in Bell, California and was immediately put up for adoption. In 1998, the boy, now Bruce Black, a successful San Jose businessman, decided to finally contact his birth father. Black had been told at age 18 by his adoptive parents who his birth father was, but lacked the nerve to contact him. Black did not know Gallinger's whereabouts, but had met San Jose Sharks radio broadcaster [[Dan Rusanowsky]] whose hobby was genealogy research. With Rusanowsky's assistance he located Gallinger. In late 1998, Black phoned Gallinger and then later took his family to Toronto to meet his father and half-brothers.

Born in [[Port Colborne]], Ontario, he played for the [[Boston Bruins]]. Gallinger was one of the league's youngest players when he broke into the NHL, playing on the \"Sprout Line\" of Boston with [[Bill Shill]] and [[Bep Guidolin]]. Gallinger's career was cut short, when in 1948 Gallinger and former team-mate Billy Taylor were discovered gambling on their own teams and banned for life by the NHL. They were reinstated in 1970 and these are the longest suspensions in NHL history. Prior to the suspension, Gallinger had established himself an effective offensive NHL player and, as an excellent multi-sport athlete, had even been sought after to play professional baseball.\n\n==Career==\nDon Gallinger came from a hockey family.

Years later, Gallinger stated that he regretted the decision as in retrospect he realized that Ross was looking for a way to defend him.<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=The Globe and Mail|location=Toronto|last=Young|first=Scott|date=Jan 29, 1963|title=Gallinger Grilled at Length by Ross and Campbell Before Suspension|page=34}}</ref>\n\nEarly in March 1948, word of a gambling scandal involving some Boston Bruin players made its way into the press. The players involved had not yet been named.\n\nOn March 3, The Bruins were playing the Chicago Blackhawks at the Boston Garden in their first game since news of the scandal became public. The Boston fans cheered loudly as the Bruin players skated onto the ice. Old-time followers of the Bruins compared the reception to the last time Boston had won the Stanley Cup in 1939. Boston was down 4\u20131 going into the third period, but rallied to tie the game. With the game at 4\u20133, Don Gallinger brought the puck down the ice, skillfully getting past at least three Blackhawks players in the process, and passed the puck to Johnny Peirson, who scored his first NHL goal to tie the game.<ref>{{cite news|title=Bruins Give Fine Reception By Boston Fans|agency=Associated Press|newspaper=Nashua Telegraph|location=Nashua, NH|date=March 4, 1948|page=21}}</ref>\n\nOn March 4, 1948, [[Walter Winchell]] named Gallinger as one of the players involved in the gambling scandal. The same day, Montreal sportswriter Dink Carroll spoke with Gallinger after the game between Boston and Montreal. \"You probably know what this is about, don't you?\" Carroll asks. \"Yes, you want to know if I've made any decision about baseball,\" Gallinger answered. Carroll informed Gallinger that Winchell had just named him as the Boston player involved. \"Winchell\", said Gallinger. \"Do you mean the fellow in New York?\" Initially Gallinger appeared too bewildered to comment, but eventually denied the accusations.<ref>{{cite news|last=Carroll|first=Dink|title=Playing the Field|page=10|newspaper=The Gazette|location=Montreal|date=March 6, 1948}}</ref>\n\nOn Sunday, March 7, the Bruins were playing the Toronto Maple Leafs in Boston. In the second period, Gallinger intercepted a [[Gus Mortson]] clearing pass and let go with a low 30-foot shot past goaltender [[Turk Broda]]. It would be Gallinger's last goal in the NHL.<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=The Gazette|location=Montreal|title=Boston Wins, 3\u20131 Over Maple Leafs|page=16|date=March 8, 1948}}</ref>\n\n====Expulsion for life====\n[[File:Clarence Campbell Stanley Cup 1957.jpg|200px|right|thumb|The president of the NHL, Clarence Campbell, banned Gallinger from the NHL for life and refused to lift the ban 15 years later.]]\nOn March 9, 1948, Gallinger was suspended indefinitely, pending an investigation, by the NHL for gambling on hockey including games involving the Bruins.

The affair became more of a scandal when she became pregnant. Her parents sent her off to California as it was unthinkable for an heiress to marry, in her parent's view, a \"lowly\" hockey player. The boy was born in 1947 in Bell, California and was immediately put up for adoption. In 1998, the boy, now Bruce Black, a successful San Jose businessman, decided to finally contact his birth father. Black had been told at age 18 by his adoptive parents who his birth father was, but lacked the nerve to contact him. Black did not know Gallinger's whereabouts, but had met San Jose Sharks radio broadcaster [[Dan Rusanowsky]] whose hobby was genealogy research. With Rusanowsky's assistance he located Gallinger. In late 1998, Black phoned Gallinger and then later took his family to Toronto to meet his father and half-brothers.

People often choose to conform to society rather than to pursue personal desires because it is often easier to follow the path others have made already, rather than creating a new one. This tendency to conform occurs in small groups and/or society as a whole, and may result from subtle unconscious influences (predisposed state of mind), or direct and overt [[social pressure]]. Conformity can occur in the presence of others, or when an individual is alone. For example, people tend to follow social norms when eating or watching television, even when alone.\n\nPeople often conform from a desire for security within a group\u2014typically a group of a similar age, culture, religion, or educational status. This is often referred to as [[groupthink]]: a pattern of thought characterized by self-deception, forced manufacture of consent, and conformity to group values and ethics, which ignores realistic appraisal of other courses of action. Unwillingness to conform carries the risk of [[social rejection]]. Conformity is often associated with adolescence and [[youth culture]], but strongly affects humans of all ages.<ref>{{cite website|last=McLeod|first=Saul|title=What is Conformity?|website =Simply Psychology|date=2016|url = https://www.simplypsychology.org/conformity.html}}</ref>\n\nAlthough [[peer pressure]] may manifest negatively, conformity can be regarded as either good or bad.

These types of responses to conformity vary in their degree of public agreement versus private agreement.\n\nWhen an individual finds themselves in a position where they publicly agree with the group's decision yet privately disagrees with the group's consensus, they are experiencing ''compliance'' or ''acquiescence''.  In turn, ''conversion'', otherwise known as ''private acceptance'', involves both publicly and privately agreeing with the group's decision. Thus, this represents a true change of opinion to match the majority.\n\nAnother type of social response, which does not involve conformity with the majority of the group, is called ''convergence''. In this type of social response, the group member agrees with the group's decision from the outset and thus does not need to shift their opinion on the matter at hand.<ref name=\"Forsyth, D. R. 2009\">{{cite book|last=Forsyth|first=D. R.|title=Group dynamics|year=2013|publisher=Wadsworth|location=New York|isbn=978-1-133-95653-2}} [Chapter 7]</ref>\n\nIn addition, Forsyth shows that nonconformity can also fall into one of two response categories. Firstly, an individual who does not conform to the majority can display ''independence''. ''Independence'', or ''dissent'', can be defined as the unwillingness to bend to group pressures. Thus, this individual stays true to his or her personal standards instead of the swaying toward group standards. Secondly, a nonconformist could be displaying ''[[Anticonformity (psychology)|anticonformity]]'' or ''counterconformity'' which involves the taking of opinions that are opposite to what the group believes. This type of nonconformity can be motivated by a need to rebel against the status quo instead of the need to be accurate in one's opinion.\n\nTo conclude, social responses to conformity can be seen to vary along a continuum from conversion to anticonformity. For example, a popular experiment in conformity research, known as the ''Asch situation'' or [[Asch conformity experiments]], primarily includes ''compliance'' and ''independence''. Also, other responses to conformity can be identified in groups such as juries, sports teams and work teams.<ref name=\"Forsyth, D. R. 2009\" />\n\n== Main experiments ==\n\n=== Sherif's experiment (1936) ===\nMuzafer Sherif was interested in knowing how many people would change their opinions to bring them in line with the opinion of a group. In his experiment, participants were placed in a dark room and asked to stare at a small dot of light 15 feet away. They were then asked to estimate the amount it moved. The trick was there was no movement, it was caused by a visual illusion known as the [[autokinetic effect]]. On the first day, each person perceived different amounts of movement, but from the second to the fourth day, the same estimate was agreed on and others conformed to it.<ref name=\"Hogg 2005\">{{cite book|last=Hogg|first=M.

M.}}</ref> Sherif suggested this was a simulation for how social norms develop in a society, providing a common frame of reference for people.\n\nSubsequent experiments were based on more realistic situations. In an eyewitness identification task, participants were shown a suspect individually and then in a lineup of other suspects. They were given one second to identify him, making it a difficult task. One group was told that their input was very important and would be used by the legal community. To the other it was simply a trial. Being more motivated to get the right answer increased the tendency to conform. Those who wanted to be more accurate conformed 51% of the time as opposed to 35% in the other group.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Baron|first=R. S. |author2=Vandello, J.

Asch conducted a modification of Sherif's study, assuming that when the situation was very clear, conformity would be drastically reduced. He exposed people in a group to a series of lines, and the participants were asked to match one line with a standard line. All participants except one were accomplices and gave the wrong answer in 12 of the 18 trials.<ref name=\"Asch 1955 31\u201335\" />\n\nThe results showed a surprisingly high degree of conformity: 74% of the participants conformed on at least one trial.

However, the increasing majority was only influential up to a point: from three or more opponents, there is more than 30% of conformity.<ref name=\"Asch 1955 31\u201335\" />\n\n== Varieties ==\nHarvard psychologist [[Herbert Kelman]] identified three major types of conformity.<ref name=\"Kelman 1958 51\u201360\">{{cite journal|last=Kelman|first=H. C|title=Compliance, Identification, and Internalization: Three Processes of Attitude Change|journal=Journal of Conflict Resolution|year=1958|volume=2|issue=1|pages=51\u201360|doi=10.1177/002200275800200106}}</ref>\n* ''[[Compliance (psychology)|Compliance]]'' is public conformity, while possibly keeping one's own original beliefs for yourself. Compliance is motivated by the need for approval and the fear of being rejected.\n* ''[[Identification (psychology)|Identification]]'' is conforming to someone who is liked and respected, such as a celebrity or a favorite uncle. This can be motivated by the attractiveness of the source,<ref name=\"Kelman 1958 51\u201360\" /> and this is a deeper type of conformism than compliance.\n* ''[[Internalization]]'' is accepting the belief or behavior and conforming both publicly and privately, if the source is credible. It is the deepest influence on people and it will affect them for a long time.\n\nAlthough Kelman's distinction has been influential, research in [[Social psychology (psychology)|social psychology]] has focused primarily on two varieties of conformity. These are ''informational'' conformity, or [[informational social influence]], and ''normative'' conformity, also called [[normative social influence]]. In Kelman's terminology, these correspond to internalization and compliance, respectively. There are naturally more than two or three variables in society influential on human [[psychology]] and conformity; the notion of \"varieties\" of conformity based upon \"social influence\" is ambiguous and indefinable in this context.\n\nFor Deutsch and G\u00e9rard (1955), conformity results from a motivational conflict  (between the fear of being socially rejected and the wish to say what we think is correct) that leads to the normative influence, and a cognitive conflict (others create doubts in what we think) which leads to the informational influence.<ref name=\"Deutsch 1955 629\u2013636\">{{cite journal|last=Deutsch|first=M|author2=G\u00e9rard, H. B|title=A study of normative and informational social influences upon individual judgement|journal=Journal of Abnormal Psychology|year=1955|volume=51|issue=3|pages=629\u2013636|doi=10.1037/h0046408|pmid=13286010}}</ref>\n\n=== Informational influence ===\n{{Main|Informational social influence}}\nInformational social influence occurs when one turns to the members of one's group to obtain and accept accurate information about reality. A person is most likely to use informational social influence in certain situations: when a situation is ambiguous, people become uncertain about what to do and they are more likely to depend on others for the answer; and during a crisis when immediate action is necessary, in spite of panic. Looking to other people can help ease fears, but unfortunately they are not always right. The more knowledgeable a person is, the more valuable they are as a resource. Thus people often turn to [[expert]]s for help. But once again people must be careful, as experts can make mistakes too. Informational social influence often results in ''internalization'' or ''private acceptance'', where a person genuinely believes that the information is right.<ref name=\"Hogg 2005\" />\n\n=== Normative influence ===\n{{Main|Normative social influence}}\nNormative social influence occurs when one conforms to be liked or accepted by the members of the group. This need of social approval and acceptance is part of our state of humans.<ref name=\"Hogg 2005\" /> In addition to this, we know that when people do not conform with their group and therefore are deviants, they are less liked and even punished by the group.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Schachter|first=S|title=Deviation, Rejection, and communication|journal=Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology|year=1951|volume=46|issue=2|pages=190\u2013208|doi=10.1037/h0062326}}</ref> Normative influence usually results in ''public compliance'', doing or saying something without believing in it. The experiment of Asch in 1951 is one example of normative influence. Even though John Turner et al argued that the post experimental interviews showed that the respondents were uncertain about the correct answers in some cases. The answers might have been evident to the experimenters but the participants did not have the same experience. Subsequent studies pointed out the fact that the participants were not known to each other and therefore did not pose a threat against social rejection. See: [[Asch conformity experiments|Normative influence vs. referent informational influence]]\n\nIn a reinterpretation of the original data from these [[Asch conformity experiments|experiments]] Hodges and Geyer (2006)<ref>{{cite journal|last=Hodges|first=B. H.|author2=Geyer, A.

They also provide compelling evidence of people's concern for others and their views.\nBy closely examining the situation in which Asch's subjects find themselves they find that the situation places multiple demands on participants: They include truth (i.e., expressing one's own view accurately), trust (i.e., taking seriously the value of others' claims), and social solidarity (i.e., a commitment to integrate the views of self and others without deprecating either). In addition to these epistemic values, there are multiple moral claims as well: These include the need for participants to care for the integrity and well-being of other participants, the experimenter, themselves, and the worth of scientific research.\n\nDeutsch & G\u00e9rard (1955) designed different situations that variated from Asch' experiment and found that when participants were writing their answer privately, they were giving the correct one<ref name=\"Deutsch 1955 629\u2013636\" />\n\nNormative influence, a function of [[social impact theory]], has three components.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Latan\u00e9|first=B|title=The psychology of social impact|journal=American Psychologist|year=1981|volume=36|issue=4|pages=343\u2013356|doi=10.1037/0003-066x.36.4.343}}</ref> The ''number of people'' in the group has a surprising effect. As the number increases, each person has less of an impact. A group's ''strength'' is how important the group is to a person. Groups we value generally have more social influence. ''Immediacy'' is how close the group is in time and space when the influence is taking place. Psychologists have constructed a mathematical model using these three factors and are able to predict the amount of conformity that occurs with some degree of accuracy.<ref>{{cite book|last=Forgas|first=J.

Each participant had five seconds to look at a slide instead of just one second. Once again, there were both high and low motives to be accurate, but the results were the reverse of the first study. The low motivation group conformed 33% of the time (similar to Asch's findings). The high motivation group conformed less at 16%. These results show that when accuracy is not very important, it is better to get the wrong answer than to risk social disapproval.\n\nAn experiment using procedures similar to Asch's found that there was significantly less conformity in six-person groups of [[friend]]s as compared to six-person groups of strangers.<ref>{{cite journal|last=McKelvey|first=W.|author2=Kerr, N.

This is known as ''minority influence'', a special case of informational influence. Minority influence is most likely when people can make a clear and consistent case for their point of view. If the minority fluctuates and shows uncertainty, the chance of influence is small. However, a minority that makes a strong, convincing case increases the probability of changing  the majority's beliefs and behaviors.<ref>{{cite book|last=Moscovici|first=S. N.|title=\"Minority influence\". Social psychology: Classic and contemporary integrations|year=1974|publisher=Rand McNally|location=Chicago|pages=217\u2013249}}</ref> Minority members who are perceived as experts, are high in status, or have benefited the group in the past are also more likely to succeed.\n\nAnother form of minority influence can sometimes override conformity effects and lead to unhealthy group dynamics. A 2007 review of two dozen studies by the University of Washington found that a single \"bad apple\" (an inconsiderate or negligent group member) can substantially increase conflicts and reduce performance in work groups. Bad apples often create a negative emotional climate that interferes with healthy group functioning. They can be avoided by careful selection procedures and managed by reassigning them to positions that require less social interaction.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Felps|first=W|author2=Mitchell, T R. |author3=Byington, E |title=How, When, and Why Bad Apples Spoil the Barrel: Negative Group Members and Dysfunctional|journal=GroupsResearch in Organizational Behavior|year=2006|volume=27|pages=175\u2013222|doi=10.1016/s0191-3085(06)27005-9}}</ref>\n\n== Specific predictors ==\n\n=== Culture ===\n[[Stanley Milgram]] found that individuals in Norway (from a collectivistic culture) exhibited a higher degree of conformity than individuals in France (from an individualistic culture).<ref name=\"Milgram\">{{cite journal | last1 = Milgram | first1 = S | year = 1961 | title = Nationality and conformity | url = https://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=milgram-nationality-conformity | journal = Scientific American | volume = 205 | issue =  6| page = 6 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20121004201132/http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=milgram-nationality-conformity | archivedate = 2012-10-04 | doi = 10.1038/scientificamerican1261-45 | bibcode = 1961SciAm.205f..45M }}</ref> Similarly, Berry studied two different populations: the Temne (collectivists) and the Inuit (individualists) and found that the Temne conformed more than the Inuit when exposed to a conformity task.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Berry|first=J W.|title=Independence and conformity in subsistence-level societies|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|year=1967|volume=7|issue=4, Pt.1|pages=415\u2013418|doi=10.1037/h0025231}}</ref>\n\nBond and Smith compared 134 studies in a meta-analysis and found that there is a positive correlation between a country's level of collectivistic values and conformity rates in the Asch paradigm.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Bond|first=M.

However, this view was not formed on the basis of [[Scientific method|empirical evidence collected in a systematic way]], but rather on the basis of anecdotes and casual observations, which are subject to a variety of [[cognitive bias]]es. Modern scientific studies comparing conformity in Japan and the United States show that Americans conform in general as much than the Japanese and, in some situations, even more. Psychology professor [[:ja:\u9ad8\u91ce\u967d\u592a\u90ce|Yohtaro Takano]] from the [[University of Tokyo]], along with Eiko Osaka reviewed four behavioral studies and found that the rate of conformity errors that the Japanese subjects manifested in the Asch paradigm was similar with that manifested by Americans.<ref>Takano, Y., & Osaka, E.

In a study by Reitan and Shaw, it was found that men and women conformed more when there were participants of both sexes involved versus participants of the same sex.

However, there were no gender differences in conformity among participants who were under 19 years of age and in surveillance conditions. There were also no gender differences when participants were not under surveillance. In a subsequent research article, Eagly suggests that women are more likely to conform than men because of lower status roles of women in society.

Milgram also conducted the same experiment once more, but told participants that the results of the study would be applied to the design of aircraft safety signals. His conformity estimates were 56% in Norway and 46% in France, suggesting that individuals conformed slightly less when the task was linked to an important issue.

People often choose to conform to society rather than to pursue personal desires because it is often easier to follow the path others have made already, rather than creating a new one. This tendency to conform occurs in small groups and/or society as a whole, and may result from subtle unconscious influences (predisposed state of mind), or direct and overt [[social pressure]]. Conformity can occur in the presence of others, or when an individual is alone. For example, people tend to follow social norms when eating or watching television, even when alone.\n\nPeople often conform from a desire for security within a group\u2014typically a group of a similar age, culture, religion, or educational status. This is often referred to as [[groupthink]]: a pattern of thought characterized by self-deception, forced manufacture of consent, and conformity to group values and ethics, which ignores realistic appraisal of other courses of action. Unwillingness to conform carries the risk of [[social rejection]]. Conformity is often associated with adolescence and [[youth culture]], but strongly affects humans of all ages.<ref>{{cite website|last=McLeod|first=Saul|title=What is Conformity?|website =Simply Psychology|date=2016|url = https://www.simplypsychology.org/conformity.html}}</ref>\n\nAlthough [[peer pressure]] may manifest negatively, conformity can be regarded as either good or bad.

These types of responses to conformity vary in their degree of public agreement versus private agreement.\n\nWhen an individual finds themselves in a position where they publicly agree with the group's decision yet privately disagrees with the group's consensus, they are experiencing ''compliance'' or ''acquiescence''.  In turn, ''conversion'', otherwise known as ''private acceptance'', involves both publicly and privately agreeing with the group's decision. Thus, this represents a true change of opinion to match the majority.\n\nAnother type of social response, which does not involve conformity with the majority of the group, is called ''convergence''. In this type of social response, the group member agrees with the group's decision from the outset and thus does not need to shift their opinion on the matter at hand.<ref name=\"Forsyth, D. R. 2009\">{{cite book|last=Forsyth|first=D. R.|title=Group dynamics|year=2013|publisher=Wadsworth|location=New York|isbn=978-1-133-95653-2}} [Chapter 7]</ref>\n\nIn addition, Forsyth shows that nonconformity can also fall into one of two response categories. Firstly, an individual who does not conform to the majority can display ''independence''. ''Independence'', or ''dissent'', can be defined as the unwillingness to bend to group pressures. Thus, this individual stays true to his or her personal standards instead of the swaying toward group standards. Secondly, a nonconformist could be displaying ''[[Anticonformity (psychology)|anticonformity]]'' or ''counterconformity'' which involves the taking of opinions that are opposite to what the group believes. This type of nonconformity can be motivated by a need to rebel against the status quo instead of the need to be accurate in one's opinion.\n\nTo conclude, social responses to conformity can be seen to vary along a continuum from conversion to anticonformity. For example, a popular experiment in conformity research, known as the ''Asch situation'' or [[Asch conformity experiments]], primarily includes ''compliance'' and ''independence''. Also, other responses to conformity can be identified in groups such as juries, sports teams and work teams.<ref name=\"Forsyth, D. R. 2009\" />\n\n== Main experiments ==\n\n=== Sherif's experiment (1936) ===\nMuzafer Sherif was interested in knowing how many people would change their opinions to bring them in line with the opinion of a group. In his experiment, participants were placed in a dark room and asked to stare at a small dot of light 15 feet away. They were then asked to estimate the amount it moved. The trick was there was no movement, it was caused by a visual illusion known as the [[autokinetic effect]]. On the first day, each person perceived different amounts of movement, but from the second to the fourth day, the same estimate was agreed on and others conformed to it.<ref name=\"Hogg 2005\">{{cite book|last=Hogg|first=M.

In an eyewitness identification task, participants were shown a suspect individually and then in a lineup of other suspects. They were given one second to identify him, making it a difficult task. One group was told that their input was very important and would be used by the legal community. To the other it was simply a trial. Being more motivated to get the right answer increased the tendency to conform. Those who wanted to be more accurate conformed 51% of the time as opposed to 35% in the other group.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Baron|first=R. S. |author2=Vandello, J.

Asch conducted a modification of Sherif's study, assuming that when the situation was very clear, conformity would be drastically reduced. He exposed people in a group to a series of lines, and the participants were asked to match one line with a standard line. All participants except one were accomplices and gave the wrong answer in 12 of the 18 trials.<ref name=\"Asch 1955 31\u201335\" />\n\nThe results showed a surprisingly high degree of conformity: 74% of the participants conformed on at least one trial.

However, the increasing majority was only influential up to a point: from three or more opponents, there is more than 30% of conformity.<ref name=\"Asch 1955 31\u201335\" />\n\n== Varieties ==\nHarvard psychologist [[Herbert Kelman]] identified three major types of conformity.<ref name=\"Kelman 1958 51\u201360\">{{cite journal|last=Kelman|first=H. C|title=Compliance, Identification, and Internalization: Three Processes of Attitude Change|journal=Journal of Conflict Resolution|year=1958|volume=2|issue=1|pages=51\u201360|doi=10.1177/002200275800200106}}</ref>\n* ''[[Compliance (psychology)|Compliance]]'' is public conformity, while possibly keeping one's own original beliefs for yourself. Compliance is motivated by the need for approval and the fear of being rejected.\n* ''[[Identification (psychology)|Identification]]'' is conforming to someone who is liked and respected, such as a celebrity or a favorite uncle. This can be motivated by the attractiveness of the source,<ref name=\"Kelman 1958 51\u201360\" /> and this is a deeper type of conformism than compliance.\n* ''[[Internalization]]'' is accepting the belief or behavior and conforming both publicly and privately, if the source is credible. It is the deepest influence on people and it will affect them for a long time.\n\nAlthough Kelman's distinction has been influential, research in [[Social psychology (psychology)|social psychology]] has focused primarily on two varieties of conformity. These are ''informational'' conformity, or [[informational social influence]], and ''normative'' conformity, also called [[normative social influence]]. In Kelman's terminology, these correspond to internalization and compliance, respectively. There are naturally more than two or three variables in society influential on human [[psychology]] and conformity; the notion of \"varieties\" of conformity based upon \"social influence\" is ambiguous and indefinable in this context.\n\nFor Deutsch and G\u00e9rard (1955), conformity results from a motivational conflict  (between the fear of being socially rejected and the wish to say what we think is correct) that leads to the normative influence, and a cognitive conflict (others create doubts in what we think) which leads to the informational influence.<ref name=\"Deutsch 1955 629\u2013636\">{{cite journal|last=Deutsch|first=M|author2=G\u00e9rard, H.

A person is most likely to use informational social influence in certain situations: when a situation is ambiguous, people become uncertain about what to do and they are more likely to depend on others for the answer; and during a crisis when immediate action is necessary, in spite of panic. Looking to other people can help ease fears, but unfortunately they are not always right. The more knowledgeable a person is, the more valuable they are as a resource. Thus people often turn to [[expert]]s for help. But once again people must be careful, as experts can make mistakes too. Informational social influence often results in ''internalization'' or ''private acceptance'', where a person genuinely believes that the information is right.<ref name=\"Hogg 2005\" />\n\n=== Normative influence ===\n{{Main|Normative social influence}}\nNormative social influence occurs when one conforms to be liked or accepted by the members of the group. This need of social approval and acceptance is part of our state of humans.<ref name=\"Hogg 2005\" /> In addition to this, we know that when people do not conform with their group and therefore are deviants, they are less liked and even punished by the group.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Schachter|first=S|title=Deviation, Rejection, and communication|journal=Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology|year=1951|volume=46|issue=2|pages=190\u2013208|doi=10.1037/h0062326}}</ref> Normative influence usually results in ''public compliance'', doing or saying something without believing in it. The experiment of Asch in 1951 is one example of normative influence. Even though John Turner et al argued that the post experimental interviews showed that the respondents were uncertain about the correct answers in some cases. The answers might have been evident to the experimenters but the participants did not have the same experience. Subsequent studies pointed out the fact that the participants were not known to each other and therefore did not pose a threat against social rejection. See: [[Asch conformity experiments|Normative influence vs. referent informational influence]]\n\nIn a reinterpretation of the original data from these [[Asch conformity experiments|experiments]] Hodges and Geyer (2006)<ref>{{cite journal|last=Hodges|first=B. H.|author2=Geyer, A. L.|title=A Nonconformist Account of the Asch Experiments: Values, Pragmatics, and Moral Dilemmas|journal=Personality and Social Psychology Review|year=2006|volume=10|issue=1|pages=2\u201319|doi=10.1207/s15327957pspr1001_1|pmid=16430326}}</ref>  found that Asch's subjects were not so conformist after all: The experiments provide powerful evidence for people's tendency to tell the truth even when others do not. They also provide compelling evidence of people's concern for others and their views.\nBy closely examining the situation in which Asch's subjects find themselves they find that the situation places multiple demands on participants: They include truth (i.e., expressing one's own view accurately), trust (i.e., taking seriously the value of others' claims), and social solidarity (i.e., a commitment to integrate the views of self and others without deprecating either). In addition to these epistemic values, there are multiple moral claims as well: These include the need for participants to care for the integrity and well-being of other participants, the experimenter, themselves, and the worth of scientific research.\n\nDeutsch & G\u00e9rard (1955) designed different situations that variated from Asch' experiment and found that when participants were writing their answer privately, they were giving the correct one<ref name=\"Deutsch 1955 629\u2013636\" />\n\nNormative influence, a function of [[social impact theory]], has three components.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Latan\u00e9|first=B|title=The psychology of social impact|journal=American Psychologist|year=1981|volume=36|issue=4|pages=343\u2013356|doi=10.1037/0003-066x.36.4.343}}</ref> The ''number of people'' in the group has a surprising effect. As the number increases, each person has less of an impact. A group's ''strength'' is how important the group is to a person. Groups we value generally have more social influence. ''Immediacy'' is how close the group is in time and space when the influence is taking place. Psychologists have constructed a mathematical model using these three factors and are able to predict the amount of conformity that occurs with some degree of accuracy.<ref>{{cite book|last=Forgas|first=J.

D}}</ref>\n\nBaron and his colleagues conducted a second ''eyewitness study'' that focused on normative influence. In this version, the task was easier. Each participant had five seconds to look at a slide instead of just one second. Once again, there were both high and low motives to be accurate, but the results were the reverse of the first study. The low motivation group conformed 33% of the time (similar to Asch's findings). The high motivation group conformed less at 16%. These results show that when accuracy is not very important, it is better to get the wrong answer than to risk social disapproval.\n\nAn experiment using procedures similar to Asch's found that there was significantly less conformity in six-person groups of [[friend]]s as compared to six-person groups of strangers.<ref>{{cite journal|last=McKelvey|first=W.|author2=Kerr, N. H.|title=Differences in conformity among friends and strangers|journal=Psychological Reports|year=1988|volume=62|issue=3|pages=759\u2013762|doi=10.2466/pr0.1988.62.3.759}}</ref> Because friends already know and accept each other, there may be less normative pressure to conform in some situations.

This is known as ''minority influence'', a special case of informational influence. Minority influence is most likely when people can make a clear and consistent case for their point of view. If the minority fluctuates and shows uncertainty, the chance of influence is small. However, a minority that makes a strong, convincing case increases the probability of changing  the majority's beliefs and behaviors.<ref>{{cite book|last=Moscovici|first=S. N.|title=\"Minority influence\". Social psychology: Classic and contemporary integrations|year=1974|publisher=Rand McNally|location=Chicago|pages=217\u2013249}}</ref> Minority members who are perceived as experts, are high in status, or have benefited the group in the past are also more likely to succeed.\n\nAnother form of minority influence can sometimes override conformity effects and lead to unhealthy group dynamics. A 2007 review of two dozen studies by the University of Washington found that a single \"bad apple\" (an inconsiderate or negligent group member) can substantially increase conflicts and reduce performance in work groups. Bad apples often create a negative emotional climate that interferes with healthy group functioning. They can be avoided by careful selection procedures and managed by reassigning them to positions that require less social interaction.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Felps|first=W|author2=Mitchell, T R. |author3=Byington, E |title=How, When, and Why Bad Apples Spoil the Barrel: Negative Group Members and Dysfunctional|journal=GroupsResearch in Organizational Behavior|year=2006|volume=27|pages=175\u2013222|doi=10.1016/s0191-3085(06)27005-9}}</ref>\n\n== Specific predictors ==\n\n=== Culture ===\n[[Stanley Milgram]] found that individuals in Norway (from a collectivistic culture) exhibited a higher degree of conformity than individuals in France (from an individualistic culture).<ref name=\"Milgram\">{{cite journal | last1 = Milgram | first1 = S | year = 1961 | title = Nationality and conformity | url = https://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=milgram-nationality-conformity | journal = Scientific American | volume = 205 | issue =  6| page = 6 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20121004201132/http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=milgram-nationality-conformity | archivedate = 2012-10-04 | doi = 10.1038/scientificamerican1261-45 | bibcode = 1961SciAm.205f..45M }}</ref> Similarly, Berry studied two different populations: the Temne (collectivists) and the Inuit (individualists) and found that the Temne conformed more than the Inuit when exposed to a conformity task.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Berry|first=J W.|title=Independence and conformity in subsistence-level societies|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|year=1967|volume=7|issue=4, Pt.1|pages=415\u2013418|doi=10.1037/h0025231}}</ref>\n\nBond and Smith compared 134 studies in a meta-analysis and found that there is a positive correlation between a country's level of collectivistic values and conformity rates in the Asch paradigm.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Bond|first=M.

However, this view was not formed on the basis of [[Scientific method|empirical evidence collected in a systematic way]], but rather on the basis of anecdotes and casual observations, which are subject to a variety of [[cognitive bias]]es. Modern scientific studies comparing conformity in Japan and the United States show that Americans conform in general as much than the Japanese and, in some situations, even more.

H.|title=Sex differences in social behavior: A social role interpretation|year=1987|publisher=Erlbaum|location=Hillsdale, NJ}}</ref> Women are generally taught to be more agreeable whereas men are taught to be more independent.\n\nThe composition of the group plays a role in conformity as well. In a study by Reitan and Shaw, it was found that men and women conformed more when there were participants of both sexes involved versus participants of the same sex. Subjects in the groups with both sexes were more apprehensive when there was a discrepancy amongst group members, and thus the subjects reported that they doubted their own judgments.<ref name=\"Reitan, 1964 45\u201351\" />\nSistrunk and McDavid made the argument that women conformed more because of a methodological bias.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Sistrunk|first=F|author2=McDavid, J.

For example, research with Australian children and adolescents ages 3 to 17 discovered that conformity decreases with age.<ref name=\"WalkerMB\">{{Cite journal\n| last1 = Walker | first1 = M.\n| last2 = Andrade | first2 = M.\n| doi = 10.1080/00224545.1996.9714014\n| title = Conformity in the Asch Task as a Function of Age\n| journal = The Journal of Social Psychology\n| volume = 136\n| issue = 3\n| pages = 367\u2013372\n| year = 1996\n| pmid = 8758616\n| pmc =\n}}</ref> Another study examined individuals that were ranged from ages 18 to 91.<ref name=\"Pasupathi\">{{Cite journal\n| doi = 10.1037/0882-7974.14.1.170\n| last1 = Pasupathi | first1 = M.\n| title = Age differences in response to conformity pressure for emotional and nonemotional material\n| journal = Psychology and Aging\n| volume = 14\n| issue = 1\n| pages = 170\u2013174\n| year = 1999\n| pmid = 10224640\n}}</ref> The results revealed a similar trend&nbsp;\u2013 older participants displayed less conformity when compared to younger participants.\n\nIn the same way that gender has been viewed as corresponding to status, age has also been argued to have status implications. Berger, Rosenholtz and Zelditch suggest that age as a status role can be observed among college students. Younger students, such as those in their first year in college, are treated as lower-status individuals and older college students are treated as higher-status individuals.<ref name=\"Berger1980\">{{cite journal | last1 = Berger | first1 = J. | last2 = Rosenholtz | first2 = S.J. | last3 = Zelditch | first3 = M. | year = 1980 | title = Status organizing processes | journal = Annual Review of Sociology | volume = 6 | issue = | pages = 479\u2013508 | doi=10.1146/annurev.so.06.080180.002403}}</ref> Therefore, given these status roles, it would be expected that younger individuals (low status) conform to the majority whereas older individuals (high status) would be expected not to conform <ref name=\"Eagly1982\" />\n\nResearchers have also reported an interaction of gender and age on conformity.<ref name=\"Eagly1980\">{{cite journal | last1 = Eagly | first1 = A.H. | last2 = Chrvala | first2 = C. | year = 1980 | title = Sex differences in conformity: Status and gender role interpretations | url = http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/search/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&_&ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=EJ344964&ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=no&accno=EJ344964 | journal = Psychology of Women Quarterly | volume = 10 | issue = 3| pages = 203\u2013220 | doi = 10.1111/j.1471-6402.1986.tb00747.x }}</ref> Eagly and Chrvala examined the role of age (under 19 years vs. 19 years and older), gender and surveillance (anticipating responses to be shared with group members vs. not anticipating responses being shared) on conformity to group opinions. They discovered that among participants that were 19 years or older, females conformed to group opinions more so than males when under surveillance (i.e., anticipated that their responses would be shared with group members). However, there were no gender differences in conformity among participants who were under 19 years of age and in surveillance conditions. There were also no gender differences when participants were not under surveillance. In a subsequent research article, Eagly suggests that women are more likely to conform than men because of lower status roles of women in society. She suggests that more submissive roles (i.e., conforming) are expected of individuals that hold low status roles.<ref name=\"Eagly1982\">{{cite journal | last1 = Eagly | first1 = A.H. | last2 = Wood | first2 = W. | year = 1982 | title = Inferred sex differences in status as a determinant of gender stereotypes about social influence | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 43 | issue = 5| pages = 915\u2013928 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.43.5.915}}</ref>  Still, Eagly and Chrvala's results do conflict with previous research which have found higher conformity levels among younger rather than older individuals.\n\n=== Size of the group ===\nAlthough conformity pressures generally increase as the size of the majority increases, a meta-analysis suggests that conformity pressures in Asch's experiment peak once the majority reaches about four or five in number.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Bond | first1 = R. | last2 = Smith | first2 = P.

A participant may not feel much pressure to conform when the first person gives an incorrect response. However, conformity pressure will increase as each additional group member also gives the same incorrect response.<ref name = Campbell1989 />\n\n=== Different stimuli ===\nIn 1961 Stanley Milgram published a study in which he utilized Asch's conformity paradigm using audio tones instead of lines; he conducted his study in Norway and France.<ref name=\"Milgram\" /> He found substantially higher levels of conformity than Asch, with participants conforming 50% of the time in France and 62% of the time in Norway during critical trials. Milgram also conducted the same experiment once more, but told participants that the results of the study would be applied to the design of aircraft safety signals. His conformity estimates were 56% in Norway and 46% in France, suggesting that individuals conformed slightly less when the task was linked to an important issue. Stanley Milgram's study demonstrated that Asch's study could be replicated with other stimuli, and that in the case of tones, there was a high degree of conformity.\n\n=== Neural correlates ===\nEvidence has been found for the involvement of the posterior medial frontal cortex (pMFC) in conformity,<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Izuma | first1 = K | year = 2013 | title = The neural basis of social influence and attitude change | url = | journal = Current Opinion in Neurobiology | volume = 23 | issue = 3| pages = 456\u2013462 | doi = 10.1016/j.conb.2013.03.009 | pmid = 23608704 }}</ref> an area associated with memory and decision-making.

They originated from the [[Donghu people]] who splintered into the [[Wuhuan]] and Xianbei when they were defeated by the [[Xiongnu]] at the end of the 3rd century BC. The Xianbei were largely subordinate to larger nomadic powers and the [[Han dynasty]] until they gained prominence in 87 AD by killing the Xiongnu [[chanyu]] [[Youliu]]. However unlike the Xiongnu, the [[Xianbei state|Xianbei political structure]] lacked the organization to pose a concerted challenge to the [[Chinese people|Chinese]] for most of their time as a nomadic people. After suffering several defeats by the end of the [[Three Kingdoms period]], the Xianbei migrated south and settled in close proximity to Chinese society and submitted as vassals, being granted the titles of Dukes. As the Xianbei Murong, Tuoba and Duan tribes were one of the [[Five Barbarians]] who were vassals of the Han Chinese Western Jin and Eastern Jin dynasties, they took part in the [[Uprising of the Five Barbarians]] as allies of the Han Chinese Eastern Jin against the other four barbarians, the [[Xiongnu]], [[Jie people|Jie]], [[Di (Five Barbarians)|Di]] and [[Qiang (historical people)|Qiang]]. The Xianbei were at one point all defeated and conquered by the Di [[Former Qin]] empire before it fell apart at the [[Battle of Fei River]] at the hands of the Eastern Jin. The Xianbei later founded their own states and reunited northern [[China]] as the [[Northern Wei]]. These states opposed and promoted [[sinicization]] at one point or another but trended towards the latter and had merged with the general Chinese population by the [[Tang dynasty]].<ref name=Gernet/><ref name=\"Van Der Veer\"/><ref name=\"urlThe Sixteen States of the Five Barbarian Peoples \u4e94\u80e1\u5341\u516d\u570b (www.chinaknowledge.de)\">{{cite web |url=http://www.chinaknowledge.de/History/Division/shiliuguo.html |title=The Sixteen States of the Five Barbarian Peoples \u4e94\u80e1\u5341\u516d\u570b (www.chinaknowledge.de) |accessdate=}}</ref><ref name=Gernet>[https://books.google.com/books?id=jqb7L-pKCV8C&pg=PA186&dq=%22five+barbarians%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=uyGqVICoM8iKgwSS5YPICg&ved=0CB8Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22five%20barbarians%22&f=false [[Jacques Gernet]], ''A History of Chinese Civilization'' Cambridge University Press 1996] P.186-87</ref><ref name=Tanigawa>[https://books.google.com/books?id=_uWUnbWbq7QC&pg=PA120&dq=%22five+barbarians%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=uyGqVICoM8iKgwSS5YPICg&ved=0CDcQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&q=%22five%20barbarians%22&f=false Michio Tanigawa & Joshua Fogel, ''Medieval Chinese Society and the Local \"community\"'' University of California Press 1985] p. 120-21</ref><ref name=\"Van Der Veer\">[https://books.google.com/books?id=slp8RTUn97AC&pg=PA200&dq=%22five+barbarians%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=uyGqVICoM8iKgwSS5YPICg&ved=0CFkQ6AEwCg#v=onepage&q=%22five%20barbarians%22&f=false Peter Van Der Veer, \"III.

The style and subjects of Xianbei art were influenced by a variety of influences, and ultimately, the Xianbei were known for emphasizing unique nomadic motifs in artistic advancements such as leaf headdresses, crouching and geometricized animals depictions, animal pendant necklaces, and metal [[openwork]].<ref name=dawn>Watt, James C.Y.

Print.</ref>\n\n===Leaf headdresses===\nThe leaf headdresses were very characteristic of Xianbei culture, and they are found especially in Murong Xianbei tombs.  Their corresponding ornamental style also links the Xianbei to Bactria.  These gold hat ornaments represented trees and antlers and, in Chinese, they are referred to as buyao (\u201cstep sway\u201d) since the thin metal leaves move when the wearer moves.  Sun Guoping first uncovered this type of artifact, and defined three main styles: \u201cBlossoming Tree\u201d (huashu), which is mounted on the front of a cap near the forehead and has one or more branches with hanging leaves that are circle or droplet shaped, \u201cBlossoming Top\u201d (dinghua), which is worn on top of the head and resembles a tree or animal with many leaf pendants, and the rare \u201cBlossoming Vine\u201d (huaman), which consists of \u201cgold strips interwoven with wires with leaves.\u201d<ref name=leaves>Laursen, Sarah.

Web. 10 Dec. 2012. <http://repository.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1480&context=edissertations>.</ref>  Leaf headdresses were made with hammered gold and decorated by punching out designs and hanging the leaf pendants with wire.  The exact origin, use, and wear of these headdresses is still being investigated and determined.  However, headdresses similar to those later also existed and were worn by women in the courts.<ref name=dawn/><ref name=leaves/><ref>http://repository.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1480&context=edissertations</ref>\n\n===Animal iconography===\nAnother key form of Xianbei art is animal iconography, which was implemented primarily in metalwork.  The Xianbei stylistically portrayed crouching animals in geometricized, abstracted, repeated forms, and distinguished their culture and art by depicting animal predation and same-animal combat.  Typically, sheep, deer, and horses were illustrated.  The artifacts, usually plaques or pendants, were made from metal, and the backgrounds were decorated with openwork or mountainous landscapes, which harks back to the Xianbei nomadic lifestyle. With repeated animal imagery, an openwork background, and a rectangular frame, the included image of the three deer plaque is a paradigm of the Xianbei art style.  Concave plaque backings imply that plaques were made using [[lost-wax casting]], or raised designs were impressed on the back of hammered metal sheets.<ref name=nomadic>Bunker, Emma C., and Zhixin Sun. \"Nomadic Art of the Eastern Eurasian Steppes: The Eugene V.

Web. <https://www.jstor.org/stable/40727370>.</ref>\n\n===Horses===\n\nThe nomadic traditions of the Xianbei inspired them to portray horses in their artwork.  The horse played a large role in the existence of the Xianbei as a nomadic people, and in one tomb, a horse skull lay atop Xianbei bells, buckles, ornaments, a saddle, and one gilded bronze stirrup.<ref>Dien, Albert E. \"The Stirrup and Its Effect on Chinese Military History.\" Ars Orientalis.

Web. <https://www.jstor.org/stable/4629341>.</ref>  The Xianbei not only created art for their horses, but they also made art to depict horses.  Another recurring motif was the winged horse.  It has been suggested by archaeologist Su Bai that this symbol was a \u201cheavenly beast in the shape of a horse\u201d because of its prominence in Xianbei mythology.<ref name=nomadic/>  This symbol is thought to have guided an early Xianbei southern migration, and is a recurring image in many Xianbei art forms.\n\n===Figurines===\nXianbei figurines help to portray the people of the society by representing pastimes, depicting specialized clothing, and implying various beliefs.  Most figurines have been recovered from Xianbei tombs, so they are primarily military and musical figures meant to serve the deceased in afterlife processions and guard the tomb.  Furthermore, the figurine clothing specifies the according social statuses: higher-ranking Xianbei wore long-sleeved robes with a straight neck shirt underneath, while lower-ranking Xianbei wore trousers and belted tunics.<ref>Dien, Albert E.

The Han bureaucrats initially helped the Xianbei run their state, but eventually the Xianbei became Sinophiles and promoted Buddhism. The beginning of this conversion is evidenced by the Buddha imagery that emerges in Xianbei art. For instance, the included Buddha imprinted leaf headdress perfectly represents the Xianbei conversion and Buddhist synthesis since it combines both the traditional nomadic Xianbei leaf headdress with the new imagery of Buddha. This Xianbei religious conversion continued to develop in the Northern Wei dynasty, and ultimately led to the creation of the [[Yungang Grottoes]].<ref name=dawn/>\n\n{{-}}\n\n==Language==\nIt is widely theorized that the Xianbei spoke a language related to the [[Mongolic languages]] or [[Turkic languages]]. Claus Sch\u00f6nig writes:\n{{bquote|The Xianbei derived from the context of the [[Donghu people|Donghu]], who are likely to have contained the linguistic ancestors of the [[Mongols]]. Later branches and descendants of the Xianbei include the [[Tuoba|Tabghach]] and [[Khitan people|Khitan]], who seem to have been linguistically Para-Mongolic. [...] Opinions differ widely as to what the linguistic impact of the Xianbei period was. Some scholars (like Clauson) have preferred to regard the Xianbei and Tabghach (Tuoba) as Turks, or even as Bulghar Turks, with the implication that the entire layer of early Turkic borrowings in Mongolic would have been received from the Xianbei, rather than from the Xiongnu. However, since the Mongolic (or Para-Mongolic) identity of the Xianbei is increasingly obvious in the light of recent progress in [[Khitan language|Khitan]] studies, it is more reasonable to assume (with Doerfer) that the flow of linguistic influence from Turkic (or Bulghar Turkic) into Mongolic was at least partly reversed during the Xianbei period, yielding the first identifiable layer of Mongolic (or Para-Mongolic) loanwords in Turkic. {{sfn|Janhunen|2006||pp=405-6}}}}\n\nIt is also possible that the Xianbei spoke more than one language.<ref>Charles Holcombe: The Xianbei in Chinese History. In: Early Medieval China 19, 2013, S. 4.</ref>\n\n==Anthropology==\nThe origins of the Xianbei are unclear. Sinologist Penglin Wang suggested that some Xianbei had Caucasoid-featured traits such as blue eyes, blonde hair and white skin due to absorbing some Indo-European elements. The Chinese often distinguished these genetic traits from their own people and regarded them as \"white slaves\". According to Fan Wenlang et al. the Murong people were considered \"white\" by the Chinese due to the complexion of their skin color. In the Jin dynasty, Murong women were sold off to many bureaucrat and aristocrats and they were also given to their servants and concubines. The mother of emperor of Ming, [[Lady Xun]], was a lowly concubine and possibly of Xianbei stock.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Wang |first1=Pengling |title=Linguistic Mysteries of Ethnonyms in Inner Asia |date=2018 |publisher=Lexington Books |isbn=1498535283 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mOdRDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA105}}</ref> During a confrontation between [[Emperor Ming of Jin]] and a rebel force in 324, his enemies were confused by his appearance, and thought he was a Xianbei due to his yellow beard. Emperor Ming's yelllowish hair could have been inherited from his mother, who was either Xianbei or [[Jie people|Jie]]. However there was undoubtedly some range of variation within their population. Yellow hair in Chinese sources could have meant brown rather than blonde and described other people such as the Jie rather than the Xianbei. It is \"likely that the bulk of the Xianbei were not visibly very different in appearance from the general population of northeastern Asia.\"<ref name=\"Holcbome\">Charles Holcombe: The Xianbei in Chinese History.

They originated from the [[Donghu people]] who splintered into the [[Wuhuan]] and Xianbei when they were defeated by the [[Xiongnu]] at the end of the 3rd century BC. The Xianbei were largely subordinate to larger nomadic powers and the [[Han dynasty]] until they gained prominence in 87 AD by killing the Xiongnu [[chanyu]] [[Youliu]]. However unlike the Xiongnu, the [[Xianbei state|Xianbei political structure]] lacked the organization to pose a concerted challenge to the [[Chinese people|Chinese]] for most of their time as a nomadic people. After suffering several defeats by the end of the [[Three Kingdoms period]], the Xianbei migrated south and settled in close proximity to Chinese society and submitted as vassals, being granted the titles of Dukes. As the Xianbei Murong, Tuoba and Duan tribes were one of the [[Five Barbarians]] who were vassals of the Han Chinese Western Jin and Eastern Jin dynasties, they took part in the [[Uprising of the Five Barbarians]] as allies of the Han Chinese Eastern Jin against the other four barbarians, the [[Xiongnu]], [[Jie people|Jie]], [[Di (Five Barbarians)|Di]] and [[Qiang (historical people)|Qiang]]. The Xianbei were at one point all defeated and conquered by the Di [[Former Qin]] empire before it fell apart at the [[Battle of Fei River]] at the hands of the Eastern Jin. The Xianbei later founded their own states and reunited northern [[China]] as the [[Northern Wei]].

Print.</ref>\n\n===Leaf headdresses===\nThe leaf headdresses were very characteristic of Xianbei culture, and they are found especially in Murong Xianbei tombs.  Their corresponding ornamental style also links the Xianbei to Bactria.  These gold hat ornaments represented trees and antlers and, in Chinese, they are referred to as buyao (\u201cstep sway\u201d) since the thin metal leaves move when the wearer moves.  Sun Guoping first uncovered this type of artifact, and defined three main styles: \u201cBlossoming Tree\u201d (huashu), which is mounted on the front of a cap near the forehead and has one or more branches with hanging leaves that are circle or droplet shaped, \u201cBlossoming Top\u201d (dinghua), which is worn on top of the head and resembles a tree or animal with many leaf pendants, and the rare \u201cBlossoming Vine\u201d (huaman), which consists of \u201cgold strips interwoven with wires with leaves.\u201d<ref name=leaves>Laursen, Sarah. Leaves That Sway: Gold Xianbei Cap Ornaments from Northeast China. UPenn Repository. N.p., n.d. Web. 10 Dec. 2012. <http://repository.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1480&context=edissertations>.</ref>  Leaf headdresses were made with hammered gold and decorated by punching out designs and hanging the leaf pendants with wire.  The exact origin, use, and wear of these headdresses is still being investigated and determined.  However, headdresses similar to those later also existed and were worn by women in the courts.<ref name=dawn/><ref name=leaves/><ref>http://repository.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1480&context=edissertations</ref>\n\n===Animal iconography===\nAnother key form of Xianbei art is animal iconography, which was implemented primarily in metalwork.  The Xianbei stylistically portrayed crouching animals in geometricized, abstracted, repeated forms, and distinguished their culture and art by depicting animal predation and same-animal combat.  Typically, sheep, deer, and horses were illustrated.  The artifacts, usually plaques or pendants, were made from metal, and the backgrounds were decorated with openwork or mountainous landscapes, which harks back to the Xianbei nomadic lifestyle. With repeated animal imagery, an openwork background, and a rectangular frame, the included image of the three deer plaque is a paradigm of the Xianbei art style.  Concave plaque backings imply that plaques were made using [[lost-wax casting]], or raised designs were impressed on the back of hammered metal sheets.<ref name=nomadic>Bunker, Emma C., and Zhixin Sun. \"Nomadic Art of the Eastern Eurasian Steppes: The Eugene V.

Web. <https://www.jstor.org/stable/40727370>.</ref>\n\n===Horses===\n\nThe nomadic traditions of the Xianbei inspired them to portray horses in their artwork.  The horse played a large role in the existence of the Xianbei as a nomadic people, and in one tomb, a horse skull lay atop Xianbei bells, buckles, ornaments, a saddle, and one gilded bronze stirrup.<ref>Dien, Albert E. \"The Stirrup and Its Effect on Chinese Military History.\" Ars Orientalis.

Web. <https://www.jstor.org/stable/4629341>.</ref>  The Xianbei not only created art for their horses, but they also made art to depict horses.  Another recurring motif was the winged horse.  It has been suggested by archaeologist Su Bai that this symbol was a \u201cheavenly beast in the shape of a horse\u201d because of its prominence in Xianbei mythology.<ref name=nomadic/>  This symbol is thought to have guided an early Xianbei southern migration, and is a recurring image in many Xianbei art forms.\n\n===Figurines===\nXianbei figurines help to portray the people of the society by representing pastimes, depicting specialized clothing, and implying various beliefs.  Most figurines have been recovered from Xianbei tombs, so they are primarily military and musical figures meant to serve the deceased in afterlife processions and guard the tomb.  Furthermore, the figurine clothing specifies the according social statuses: higher-ranking Xianbei wore long-sleeved robes with a straight neck shirt underneath, while lower-ranking Xianbei wore trousers and belted tunics.<ref>Dien, Albert E. Six Dynasties Civilization. New Haven, CT: Yale UP, 2007. Print.</ref>\n\n===Buddhist influences===\nXianbei Buddhist influences were derived from interactions with Han culture.  The Han bureaucrats initially helped the Xianbei run their state, but eventually the Xianbei became Sinophiles and promoted Buddhism. The beginning of this conversion is evidenced by the Buddha imagery that emerges in Xianbei art. For instance, the included Buddha imprinted leaf headdress perfectly represents the Xianbei conversion and Buddhist synthesis since it combines both the traditional nomadic Xianbei leaf headdress with the new imagery of Buddha. This Xianbei religious conversion continued to develop in the Northern Wei dynasty, and ultimately led to the creation of the [[Yungang Grottoes]].<ref name=dawn/>\n\n{{-}}\n\n==Language==\nIt is widely theorized that the Xianbei spoke a language related to the [[Mongolic languages]] or [[Turkic languages]]. Claus Sch\u00f6nig writes:\n{{bquote|The Xianbei derived from the context of the [[Donghu people|Donghu]], who are likely to have contained the linguistic ancestors of the [[Mongols]]. Later branches and descendants of the Xianbei include the [[Tuoba|Tabghach]] and [[Khitan people|Khitan]], who seem to have been linguistically Para-Mongolic. [...] Opinions differ widely as to what the linguistic impact of the Xianbei period was. Some scholars (like Clauson) have preferred to regard the Xianbei and Tabghach (Tuoba) as Turks, or even as Bulghar Turks, with the implication that the entire layer of early Turkic borrowings in Mongolic would have been received from the Xianbei, rather than from the Xiongnu. However, since the Mongolic (or Para-Mongolic) identity of the Xianbei is increasingly obvious in the light of recent progress in [[Khitan language|Khitan]] studies, it is more reasonable to assume (with Doerfer) that the flow of linguistic influence from Turkic (or Bulghar Turkic) into Mongolic was at least partly reversed during the Xianbei period, yielding the first identifiable layer of Mongolic (or Para-Mongolic) loanwords in Turkic. {{sfn|Janhunen|2006||pp=405-6}}}}\n\nIt is also possible that the Xianbei spoke more than one language.<ref>Charles Holcombe: The Xianbei in Chinese History. In: Early Medieval China 19, 2013, S. 4.</ref>\n\n==Anthropology==\nThe origins of the Xianbei are unclear. Sinologist Penglin Wang suggested that some Xianbei had Caucasoid-featured traits such as blue eyes, blonde hair and white skin due to absorbing some Indo-European elements. The Chinese often distinguished these genetic traits from their own people and regarded them as \"white slaves\". According to Fan Wenlang et al. the Murong people were considered \"white\" by the Chinese due to the complexion of their skin color. In the Jin dynasty, Murong women were sold off to many bureaucrat and aristocrats and they were also given to their servants and concubines. The mother of emperor of Ming, [[Lady Xun]], was a lowly concubine and possibly of Xianbei stock.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Wang |first1=Pengling |title=Linguistic Mysteries of Ethnonyms in Inner Asia |date=2018 |publisher=Lexington Books |isbn=1498535283 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mOdRDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA105}}</ref> During a confrontation between [[Emperor Ming of Jin]] and a rebel force in 324, his enemies were confused by his appearance, and thought he was a Xianbei due to his yellow beard. Emperor Ming's yelllowish hair could have been inherited from his mother, who was either Xianbei or [[Jie people|Jie]]. However there was undoubtedly some range of variation within their population. Yellow hair in Chinese sources could have meant brown rather than blonde and described other people such as the Jie rather than the Xianbei. It is \"likely that the bulk of the Xianbei were not visibly very different in appearance from the general population of northeastern Asia.\"<ref name=\"Holcbome\">Charles Holcombe: The Xianbei in Chinese History.

In addition, the country is changed to \"USA\", though the title is kept unchanged.

Referred to as \"the garden of the Abbey and Convent\", and later \"the Covent Garden\", it was seized by [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] and granted to the [[Earl of Bedford|Earls of Bedford]] in 1552. The [[Francis Russell, 4th Earl of Bedford|4th Earl]] commissioned [[Inigo Jones]] to build some fine houses to attract wealthy tenants. Jones designed the [[Italianate]] arcaded square along with the church of [[St Paul's, Covent Garden|St Paul's]]. The design of the square was new to London and had a significant influence on modern town planning, acting as the prototype for new estates as London grew.<ref name=INF/>\n\nBy 1654 a small open-air fruit-and-vegetable market had developed on the south side of the fashionable square. Gradually, both the market and the surrounding area fell into disrepute, as taverns, theatres, coffee-houses and brothels opened up.<ref name=SocialHistory/> By the 18th century it had become a well-known [[red-light district]]. An Act of Parliament was drawn up to control the area, and [[Charles Fowler]]'s neo-classical building was erected in 1830 to cover and help organise the market. The market grew and further buildings were added: the Floral Hall, Charter Market, and in 1904 the Jubilee Market. By the end of the 1960s traffic congestion was causing problems, and in 1974 the market relocated to the [[New Covent Garden Market]] about three miles (5&nbsp;km) south-west at [[Nine Elms]]. The central building re-opened as a shopping centre in 1980 and is now a tourist location containing cafes, pubs, small shops, and a craft market called the Apple Market, along with another market held in the Jubilee Hall.\n\nCovent Garden falls within the London boroughs of [[City of Westminster|Westminster]] and [[London Borough of Camden|Camden]] and the parliamentary constituencies of [[Cities of London and Westminster (UK Parliament constituency)|Cities of London and Westminster]] and [[Holborn and St Pancras (UK Parliament constituency)|Holborn and St Pancras]].

Referred to as \"the garden of the Abbey and Convent\", and later \"the Covent Garden\", it was seized by [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] and granted to the [[Earl of Bedford|Earls of Bedford]] in 1552. The [[Francis Russell, 4th Earl of Bedford|4th Earl]] commissioned [[Inigo Jones]] to build some fine houses to attract wealthy tenants. Jones designed the [[Italianate]] arcaded square along with the church of [[St Paul's, Covent Garden|St Paul's]]. The design of the square was new to London and had a significant influence on modern town planning, acting as the prototype for new estates as London grew.<ref name=INF/>\n\nBy 1654 a small open-air fruit-and-vegetable market had developed on the south side of the fashionable square. Gradually, both the market and the surrounding area fell into disrepute, as taverns, theatres, coffee-houses and brothels opened up.<ref name=SocialHistory/> By the 18th century it had become a well-known [[red-light district]]. An Act of Parliament was drawn up to control the area, and [[Charles Fowler]]'s neo-classical building was erected in 1830 to cover and help organise the market. The market grew and further buildings were added: the Floral Hall, Charter Market, and in 1904 the Jubilee Market. By the end of the 1960s traffic congestion was causing problems, and in 1974 the market relocated to the [[New Covent Garden Market]] about three miles (5&nbsp;km) south-west at [[Nine Elms]]. The central building re-opened as a shopping centre in 1980 and is now a tourist location containing cafes, pubs, small shops, and a craft market called the Apple Market, along with another market held in the Jubilee Hall.\n\nCovent Garden falls within the London boroughs of [[City of Westminster|Westminster]] and [[London Borough of Camden|Camden]] and the parliamentary constituencies of [[Cities of London and Westminster (UK Parliament constituency)|Cities of London and Westminster]] and [[Holborn and St Pancras (UK Parliament constituency)|Holborn and St Pancras]].

Artists like [[The Rolling Stones]], [[David Bowie]], [[Duran Duran]], [[Simple Minds]], [[INXS]], [[Eurythmics]], [[Depeche Mode]], [[The Clash]], [[New Order (band)|New Order]] and [[Devo]] belong, according to Allmusic, to this genre. Dance-rock embraces some experimental funk acts like [[A Certain Ratio]], [[Gang of Four (band)|Gang of Four]], and also musicians, for example [[Robert Palmer (singer)|Robert Palmer]], [[Billy Idol]] and [[Hall & Oates]].
