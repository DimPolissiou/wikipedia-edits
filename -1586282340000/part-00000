On the down side is the weight of the batteries, which raises the vehicle weight, and their range before recharging of between {{convert|300 and 600|km|mi|0}}. Currently, battery electric units have a higher purchase price and running cost than petrol or diesel railcars, needing one or more charging stations along the routes they operate, unless they operate on a mixture of electrified and unelectrified track being charged from the electrified track. \n\nBattery technology has greatly improved over the past 20 years broadening the scope of use of battery trains, moving away from limited niche applications. Despite higher purchase and running costs, on certain railway lines battery trains are economically viable as the very high cost and maintenance of full line electrification is eliminated. From March 2014 passenger battery trains have been in operation in Japan on a number of lines. Austria has overhead wire/battery trains which became operational in 2019.<ref>http://www.railway-technology.com/features/featurepowering-the-trains-of-tomorrow-5723499/</ref> Britain successfully trialled fare paying passenger hybrid overhead wire/lithium battery trains in January and February 2015.<ref>https://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/551880/Network-Rail-launches-first-battery-run-passenger-train-in-50-years</ref>\n\n==History==\nExperiments with accumulator railcars, as they were originally called, were conducted from around 1890 in Belgium, France, Germany and Italy. In the USA, railcars of the ''Edison-Beach'' type, with [[nickel-iron battery|nickel-iron batteries]] were used from 1911. In New Zealand, a [[NZR RM class (Edison battery-electric)|battery-electric Edison railcar]] operated from 1926 to 1934. The Drumm [[nickel-zinc battery]] was used on [[Drumm Battery Train|four 2-car sets]] between 1932 and 1946 on [[Harcourt Street railway line|the Harcourt Street Line]] in [[Ireland]] and [[British Railways]] used [[lead-acid batteries]] in a [[British Rail BEMU|railcar in 1958]]. Between 1955 and 1995 Deutsche Bahn railways successfully operated 232 [[DB Class ETA 150]] railcars utilising [[lead-acid batteries]].\n\n==Supercapacitors==\n[[Image:Metro Sul do Tejo - Corroios02.jpg|thumb|right|Siemens Avenio trams have supercapacitor versions]]\nA number of tramway manufacturers are offering battery tramcars that combine the traction battery with a [[supercapacitor]] that will be charged at each stop. The main motivation for the usage of battery-powered tramways is to avoid [[Overhead line|overhead wires]] across a city. Using boost charging at each stop allows to lower the size of the required traction battery.  This technology is hoped to be transferred to full trains. \n\nThe [[Construcciones y Auxiliar de Ferrocarriles|CAF]] [[Urbos 3]] tramways was ordered for the [[MetroCentro (Seville)|Seville MetroCentro]] with the ''Acumulador de Carga R\u00e1pida'' system which uses short overhead wires at each stop for charging.

The line is diesel train operated unable to progress into the electric 3rd rail underground Birkenhead and Liverpool Merseyrail tunnels. The diesel operated line terminates at [[Bidston railway station]] in Birkenhead, with passengers having to change trains at Bidston to proceed onto the Merseyrail electric network. Network Rail proposed using dual battery powered/3rd rail pickup rolling stock without full electrification of the 27 mile long line, providing a cheaper method of increasing connectivity into the electrified underground sections of the Birkenhead and Liverpool Merseyrail Wirral Line. If battery trains are introduced the Borderlands line will be incorporated into the Wirral Line becoming an urban metro line, in which trains only terminate at Wrexham running around the electrified Liverpool city centre underground tunnels in a loop.\n\nOn page 37 of the Liverpool City Region Combined Authority, Long Term Rail Strategy document of October 2017, it states that in 2020 a trial of new [[British Rail Class 777|class 777]] [[Merseyrail]] electric 3rd rail/battery trains will be undertaken in view to incorporate two stretches of unelectrified track onto the [[Merseyrail]] network. The sections are on the [[Wirral Line]] from [[Ellesmere Port railway station|Ellesmere Port]] to [[Helsby railway station|Helsby interchange]] station and the [[Northern Line (Merseyrail)|Northern Line]] from [[Ormskirk railway station|Ormskirk]] to [[Preston railway station|Preston interchange]] station.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://moderngov.merseytravel.uk.net/documents/s21686/Enc.%201%20for%20Updated%20Long%20term%20Rail%20Strategy.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2018-03-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171107021632/http://moderngov.merseytravel.uk.net/documents/s21686/Enc.%201%20for%20Updated%20Long%20term%20Rail%20Strategy.pdf |archive-date=2017-11-07 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n====Class 230====\n[[File:D-Train-203001-Approach-Honeybourne-P1410129.jpg|thumb|Vivarail battery electric train]]\nVivarail have produced the [[British Rail Class 230|Class 230]] train which is converted from redundant [[London Underground]] [[London Underground D78 Stock|D-Stock trains]].

On the down side is the weight of the batteries, which raises the vehicle weight, and their range before recharging of between {{convert|300 and 600|km|mi|0}}. Currently, battery electric units have a higher purchase price and running cost than petrol or diesel railcars, needing one or more charging stations along the routes they operate, unless they operate on a mixture of electrified and unelectrified track being charged from the electrified track. \n\nBattery technology has greatly improved over the past 20 years broadening the scope of use of battery trains, moving away from limited niche applications. Despite higher purchase and running costs, on certain railway lines battery trains are economically viable as the very high cost and maintenance of full line electrification is eliminated. From March 2014 passenger battery trains have been in operation in Japan on a number of lines. Austria has overhead wire/battery trains which became operational in 2019.<ref>http://www.railway-technology.com/features/featurepowering-the-trains-of-tomorrow-5723499/</ref> Britain successfully trialled fare paying passenger hybrid overhead wire/lithium battery trains in January and February 2015.<ref>https://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/551880/Network-Rail-launches-first-battery-run-passenger-train-in-50-years</ref>\n\n==History==\nExperiments with accumulator railcars, as they were originally called, were conducted from around 1890 in Belgium, France, Germany and Italy. In the USA, railcars of the ''Edison-Beach'' type, with [[nickel-iron battery|nickel-iron batteries]] were used from 1911. In New Zealand, a [[NZR RM class (Edison battery-electric)|battery-electric Edison railcar]] operated from 1926 to 1934. The Drumm [[nickel-zinc battery]] was used on [[Drumm Battery Train|four 2-car sets]] between 1932 and 1946 on [[Harcourt Street railway line|the Harcourt Street Line]] in [[Ireland]] and [[British Railways]] used [[lead-acid batteries]] in a [[British Rail BEMU|railcar in 1958]]. Between 1955 and 1995 Deutsche Bahn railways successfully operated 232 [[DB Class ETA 150]] railcars utilising [[lead-acid batteries]].\n\n==Supercapacitors==\n[[Image:Metro Sul do Tejo - Corroios02.jpg|thumb|right|Siemens Avenio trams have supercapacitor versions]]\nA number of tramway manufacturers are offering battery tramcars that combine the traction battery with a [[supercapacitor]] that will be charged at each stop. The main motivation for the usage of battery-powered tramways is to avoid [[Overhead line|overhead wires]] across a city. Using boost charging at each stop allows to lower the size of the required traction battery.  This technology is hoped to be transferred to full trains. \n\nThe [[Construcciones y Auxiliar de Ferrocarriles|CAF]] [[Urbos 3]] tramways was ordered for the [[MetroCentro (Seville)|Seville MetroCentro]] with the ''Acumulador de Carga R\u00e1pida'' system which uses short overhead wires at each stop for charging.

The line is diesel train operated unable to progress into the electric 3rd rail underground Birkenhead and Liverpool Merseyrail tunnels. The diesel operated line terminates at [[Bidston railway station]] in Birkenhead, with passengers having to change trains at Bidston to proceed onto the Merseyrail electric network. Network Rail proposed using dual battery powered/3rd rail pickup rolling stock without full electrification of the 27 mile long line, providing a cheaper method of increasing connectivity into the electrified underground sections of the Birkenhead and Liverpool Merseyrail Wirral Line. If battery trains are introduced the Borderlands line will be incorporated into the Wirral Line becoming an urban metro line, in which trains only terminate at Wrexham running around the electrified Liverpool city centre underground tunnels in a loop.\n\nOn page 37 of the Liverpool City Region Combined Authority, Long Term Rail Strategy document of October 2017, it states that in 2020 a trial of new [[British Rail Class 777|class 777]] [[Merseyrail]] electric 3rd rail/battery trains will be undertaken in view to incorporate two stretches of unelectrified track onto the [[Merseyrail]] network.

Some areas later forming a part of Uttar Dinajpur were parts of kingdoms in Nepal. Dinajpur district was constituted by the [[British Empire|British]] in 1786, with a portion of the estate of Dinajpur Raj. Subsequent to the [[Permanent Settlement]] in 1793, the semi-independent Dinajpur Raj was further broken down and some of its tracts were transferred to the neighbouring British districts of Purnea, Malda, Rajshahi and Bogra. In 1947, the [[Radcliffe Line]] placed the Sadar and Thakurgaon subdivisions of Dinajpur district in East Pakistan. The Balurghat subdivision of Dinajpur district was reconstituted as West Dinajpur district in West Bengal.

The township of [[Kishanganj]] and its entire municipal boundary remained within Bihar. Islampur subdivision was formed in March 1959.

All rivers flow in that direction. Except for the eastern fringes of Chopra CD Block, most of the district is a part of the catchment area of the Mahanada and also a part of the larger [[Barind Tract]]. The soil is composed of different varieties of [[alluvium]]. The main rivers are: [[Nagar River (Rangpur)|Nagar]], [[Mahananda River|Mahananda]], Kulik, Gamari, Chhiramati (Srimati) and [[Tangon River|Tangon]]. The rivers have little water in the dry season but with heavy rains, during [[monsoon]], overflow the banks. The Nagar River flows along the international border with Bangladesh and then forms the boundary between Karandighi and Raiganj CD Blocks.

Some areas later forming a part of Uttar Dinajpur were parts of kingdoms in Nepal. Dinajpur district was constituted by the [[British Empire|British]] in 1786, with a portion of the estate of Dinajpur Raj. Subsequent to the [[Permanent Settlement]] in 1793, the semi-independent Dinajpur Raj was further broken down and some of its tracts were transferred to the neighbouring British districts of Purnea, Malda, Rajshahi and Bogra. In 1947, the [[Radcliffe Line]] placed the Sadar and Thakurgaon subdivisions of Dinajpur district in East Pakistan. The Balurghat subdivision of Dinajpur district was reconstituted as West Dinajpur district in West Bengal.

The township of [[Kishanganj]] and its entire municipal boundary remained within Bihar. Islampur subdivision was formed in March 1959. At the same time, the portion of Chopra PS lying to the north of the Mahananda river covering an area that now comprises Bidhannagar-1 gram panchayat, Bidhannagar-2 GP, Chathat-Bansgaon GP and the southern half of Phansidewa-Bansgaon Kismat GP in Darjeeling district, was transferred from West Dinajpur to the jurisdiction of Phansidewa PS in Darjeling district.

All rivers flow in that direction. Except for the eastern fringes of Chopra CD Block, most of the district is a part of the catchment area of the Mahanada and also a part of the larger [[Barind Tract]]. The soil is composed of different varieties of [[alluvium]]. The main rivers are: [[Nagar River (Rangpur)|Nagar]], [[Mahananda River|Mahananda]], Kulik, Gamari, Chhiramati (Srimati) and [[Tangon River|Tangon]]. The rivers have little water in the dry season but with heavy rains, during [[monsoon]], overflow the banks. The Nagar River flows along the international border with Bangladesh and then forms the boundary between Karandighi and Raiganj CD Blocks.

Thus, no deceleration in population growth rates occurred in the district until after 1991\u2026 In addition to [[Illegal immigration in India|Hindu and tribal migrants]] from across the international border, a sizeable number of migrant Muslims have also settled in the district, mainly driven by economic reasons\u2026 migrants from other states comprised 23% of the total migrants residing in Uttar Dinajpur.\u201d The large number of migrants from other states is mainly from the neighbouring areas in Bihar.<ref name=population/>\n\nA study by North Bengal University has observed that \u201cImmigrants from East Pakistan/Bangladesh have arrived in Uttar Dinajpur in almost equal numbers before and after 1971.\u201d   The Human Development Report opines, \u201cThe overall post-Partition impact on the rates of demographic growth has been particularly strong in all North Bengal districts.

The term '''Arthropoda''' as originally proposed refers to a proposed grouping of Euarthropods and the phylum [[Onychophora]].\n\nArthropods are characterized by their jointed limbs and [[Arthropod cuticle|cuticle]] made of [[chitin]], often [[Mineralization (biology)|mineralised]] with [[calcium carbonate]]. The arthropod [[body plan]] consists of segments, each with a pair of appendages. The rigid cuticle inhibits growth, so arthropods replace it periodically by [[moulting]]. Arthropods are bilaterally symmetrical and their body possesses an [[exoskeleton|external skeleton]]. Some species have wings.\n\nTheir versatility has enabled arthropods to become the most species-rich members of all [[Guild (ecology)|ecological guilds]] in most environments. They have over a million described species, making up more than 80 percent of all described living animal species, some of which, unlike most other animals, are very successful in dry environments. Arthropods range in size from the microscopic crustacean ''[[Stygotantulus]]'' up to the [[Japanese spider crab]].\n\nAn arthropods' primary internal cavity is a [[haemocoel]], which accommodates their internal [[Organ (anatomy)|organs]], and through which their [[haemolymph]] \u2013 analogue of [[blood]] \u2013 circulates; they have [[Circulatory system#Open circulatory system|open circulatory systems]]. Like their exteriors, the internal organs of arthropods are generally built of repeated segments. Their [[nervous system]] is \"ladder-like\", with paired [[Anatomical terms of location#Dorsal and ventral|ventral]] [[Ventral nerve cord|nerve cords]] running through all segments and forming paired [[ganglia]] in each segment. Their heads are formed by fusion of varying numbers of segments, and their [[brain]]s are formed by fusion of the ganglia of these segments and encircle the [[esophagus]]. The [[respiratory system|respiratory]] and [[excretion|excretory]] systems of arthropods vary, depending as much on their environment as on the [[subphylum]] to which they belong. \n\nTheir vision relies on various combinations of [[compound eye]]s and pigment-pit [[ocelli]]: in most species the ocelli can only detect the direction from which light is coming, and the compound eyes are the main source of information, but the main eyes of [[spider]]s are ocelli that can form images and, in a few cases, can swivel to track prey. Arthropods also have a wide range of chemical and mechanical sensors, mostly based on modifications of the many bristles known as [[seta]]e that project through their cuticles.\n\nArthropods' methods of reproduction and development are diverse; all terrestrial species use [[internal fertilization]], but this is often by indirect transfer of the sperm via an appendage or the ground, rather than by direct injection. Aquatic species use either internal or [[external fertilization]]. Almost all arthropods lay eggs, but [[scorpion]]s give birth to live young after the eggs have hatched inside the mother. Arthropod hatchlings vary from miniature adults to grubs and [[caterpillar]]s that lack jointed limbs and eventually undergo a total [[metamorphosis]] to produce the adult form. The level of maternal care for hatchlings varies from nonexistent to the prolonged care provided by scorpions.\n\nThe evolutionary ancestry of arthropods dates back to the [[Cambrian]] period. The group is generally regarded as [[monophyletic]], and many analyses support the placement of arthropods with [[cycloneuralia]]ns (or their constituent clades) in a superphylum [[Ecdysozoa]]. Overall, however, the [[basal (evolution)|basal]] relationships of animals are not yet well resolved. Likewise, the relationships between various arthropod groups are still actively debated. \n\nArthropods contribute to the human food supply both directly as food, and more importantly indirectly as [[pollination|pollinators]] of crops. Some species are known to spread severe disease to humans, [[livestock]], and crops.\n\n== Etymology ==\n\nIf your from science class most of this stuff is wrong so just look it up.

Setae are as varied in form and function as appendages. For example, they are often used as sensors to detect air or water currents, or contact with objects; aquatic arthropods use [[feather]]-like setae to increase the surface area of swimming appendages and to [[filter feeding|filter]] food particles out of water; aquatic insects, which are air-breathers, use thick [[felt]]-like coats of setae to trap air, extending the time they can spend under water; heavy, rigid setae serve as defensive spines.<ref name=\"RuppertFoxBarnes2004P518\" />\n\nAlthough all arthropods use muscles attached to the inside of the exoskeleton to flex their limbs, some still use [[hydraulic]] pressure to extend them, a system inherited from their pre-arthropod ancestors;<ref>{{citation |author1=Barnes, R.

Arthropods therefore replace their exoskeletons by undergoing [[ecdysis]] (moulting), or shedding the old exoskeleton after growing a new one that is not yet hardened. Moulting cycles run nearly continuously until an arthropod reaches full size.<ref name=\"RuppertFoxBarnes2004P523To524\">[[#refRuppert|Ruppert, Fox & Barnes (2004)]], pp. 523\u2013524</ref>\n\nThe developmental stages between each moult (ecdysis) until sexual maturity is reached is called an [[instar]]. Differences between instars can often be seen in altered body proportions, colors, patterns, changes in the number of body segments or head width. After moulting, i.e. shedding their exoskeleton, the juvenile arthropods continue in their life cycle until they either pupate or moult again.\n\nIn the initial phase of moulting, the animal stops feeding and its epidermis releases moulting fluid, a mixture of [[enzyme]]s that digests the [[endocuticle]] and thus detaches the old cuticle. This phase begins when the [[epidermis (zoology)|epidermis]] has secreted a new [[epicuticle]] to protect it from the enzymes, and the epidermis secretes the new exocuticle while the old cuticle is detaching. When this stage is complete, the animal makes its body swell by taking in a large quantity of water or air, and this makes the old cuticle split along predefined weaknesses where the old exocuticle was thinnest. It commonly takes several minutes for the animal to struggle out of the old cuticle. At this point, the new one is wrinkled and so soft that the animal cannot support itself and finds it very difficult to move, and the new endocuticle has not yet formed. The animal continues to pump itself up to stretch the new cuticle as much as possible, then hardens the new exocuticle and eliminates the excess air or water. By the end of this phase, the new endocuticle has formed. Many arthropods then eat the discarded cuticle to reclaim its materials.<ref name=\"RuppertFoxBarnes2004P523To524\" />\n\nBecause arthropods are unprotected and nearly immobilized until the new cuticle has hardened, they are in danger both of being trapped in the old cuticle and of being attacked by predators. Moulting may be responsible for 80 to 90% of all arthropod deaths.<ref name=\"RuppertFoxBarnes2004P523To524\" />\n\n=== Internal organs ===\n{{Annotated image/Basic arthropod internal structure}}\nArthropod bodies are also segmented internally, and the nervous, muscular, circulatory, and excretory systems have repeated components.<ref name=\"RuppertFoxBarnes2004P518\" /> Arthropods come from a lineage of animals that have a [[coelom]], a membrane-lined cavity between the gut and the body wall that accommodates the internal organs. The strong, segmented limbs of arthropods eliminate the need for one of the coelom's main ancestral functions, as a [[hydrostatic skeleton]], which muscles compress in order to change the animal's shape and thus enable it to move. Hence the coelom of the arthropod is reduced to small areas around the reproductive and excretory systems. Its place is largely taken by a [[hemocoel]], a cavity that runs most of the length of the body and through which [[blood]] flows.<ref name=\"RuppertFoxBarnes2004P527To528\">[[#refRuppert|Ruppert, Fox & Barnes (2004)]], pp. 527\u2013528</ref>\n\n=== Respiration and circulation ===\n{{See also|Hemolymph|hemocyte}}\nArthropods have open [[circulatory system]]s, although most have a few short, open-ended [[artery|arteries]]. In chelicerates and crustaceans, the blood carries [[oxygen]] to the tissues, while [[hexapoda|hexapods]] use a separate system of [[Invertebrate trachea|tracheae]]. Many crustaceans, but few chelicerates and [[tracheata|tracheates]], use [[respiratory pigment]]s to assist oxygen transport. The most common respiratory pigment in arthropods is [[copper]]-based [[hemocyanin]]; this is used by many crustaceans and a few [[centipede]]s. A few crustaceans and insects use iron-based [[hemoglobin]], the respiratory pigment used by [[vertebrate]]s. As with other invertebrates, the respiratory pigments of those arthropods that have them are generally dissolved in the blood and rarely enclosed in [[Blood cell|corpuscles]] as they are in vertebrates.<ref name=\"RuppertFoxBarnes2004P527To528\" />\n\nThe heart is typically a muscular tube that runs just under the back and for most of the length of the hemocoel. It contracts in ripples that run from rear to front, pushing blood forwards. Sections not being squeezed by the heart muscle are expanded either by elastic [[ligament]]s or by small [[muscle]]s, in either case connecting the heart to the body wall. Along the heart run a series of paired ostia, non-return valves that allow blood to enter the heart but prevent it from leaving before it reaches the front.<ref name=\"RuppertFoxBarnes2004P527To528\" />\n\nArthropods have a wide variety of respiratory systems. Small species often do not have any, since their high ratio of surface area to volume enables simple diffusion through the body surface to supply enough oxygen. Crustacea usually have gills that are modified appendages. Many arachnids have [[book lung]]s.<ref name=\"Garwood\" /> Tracheae, systems of branching tunnels that run from the openings in the body walls, deliver oxygen directly to individual cells in many insects, myriapods and [[arachnid]]s.<ref>[[#refRuppert|Ruppert, Fox & Barnes (2004)]], pp. 530, 733</ref>\n\n=== Nervous system ===\nLiving arthropods have paired main nerve cords running along their bodies below the gut, and in each segment the cords form a pair of [[ganglia]] from which [[sensory nerve|sensory]] and [[motor nerve|motor]] nerves run to other parts of the segment. Although the pairs of ganglia in each segment often appear physically fused, they are connected by [[commissure]]s (relatively large bundles of nerves), which give arthropod nervous systems a characteristic \"ladder-like\" appearance. The brain is in the head, encircling and mainly ''above'' the esophagus. It consists of the fused ganglia of the acron and one or two of the foremost segments that form the head&nbsp;\u2013 a total of three pairs of ganglia in most arthropods, but only two in chelicerates, which do not have antennae or the ganglion connected to them. The ganglia of other head segments are often close to the brain and function as part of it. In insects these other head ganglia combine into a pair of [[subesophageal ganglia]], under and behind the esophagus. Spiders take this process a step further, as ''all'' the [[segmental ganglia]] are incorporated into the subesophageal ganglia, which occupy most of the space in the cephalothorax (front \"super-segment\").<ref name=\"RuppertFoxBarnes2004P531To532\">[[#refRuppert|Ruppert, Fox & Barnes (2004)]], pp. 531\u2013532</ref>\n\n=== Excretory system ===\nThere are two different types of arthropod excretory systems. In aquatic arthropods, the end-product of biochemical reactions that [[metabolism|metabolise]] [[nitrogen]] is [[ammonia]], which is so toxic that it needs to be diluted as much as possible with water. The ammonia is then eliminated via any permeable membrane, mainly through the gills.<ref name=\"Garwood\" /> All crustaceans use this system, and its high consumption of water may be responsible for the relative lack of success of crustaceans as land animals.<ref name=\"RuppertFoxBarnes2004P529To530\">[[#refRuppert|Ruppert, Fox & Barnes (2004)]], pp. 529\u2013530</ref> Various groups of terrestrial arthropods have independently developed a different system: the end-product of nitrogen metabolism is [[uric acid]], which can be excreted as dry material; the [[Malpighian tubule system]] filters the uric acid and other nitrogenous waste out of the blood in the hemocoel, and dumps these materials into the hindgut, from which they are expelled as [[feces]].<ref name=\"RuppertFoxBarnes2004P529To530\" /> Most aquatic arthropods and some terrestrial ones also have organs called [[nephridia]] (\"little [[kidney]]s\"), which extract other wastes for excretion as [[urine]].<ref name=\"RuppertFoxBarnes2004P529To530\" />\n\n=== Senses ===\n\n==== Optical ====\n{{main|Arthropod eye}}\nThe stiff [[cuticle]]s of arthropods would block out information about the outside world, except that they are penetrated by many sensors or connections from sensors to the nervous system. In fact, arthropods have modified their cuticles into elaborate arrays of sensors. Various touch sensors, mostly [[seta]]e, respond to different levels of force, from strong contact to very weak air currents. Chemical sensors provide equivalents of [[taste]] and [[Olfaction|smell]], often by means of setae. Pressure sensors often take the form of membranes that function as [[eardrum]]s, but are connected directly to nerves rather than to [[auditory ossicle]]s. The [[Antenna (biology)|antennae]] of most hexapods include sensor packages that monitor [[humidity]], moisture and temperature.<ref name=\"RuppertFoxBarnes2004P532To537\">[[#refRuppert|Ruppert, Fox & Barnes (2004)]], pp. 532\u2013537</ref>\n\n[[File:Wasp ocelli.JPG|240px|thumb|right|Head of a [[wasp]] with three ocelli (center), and compound eyes at the left and right]]\nMost arthropods have sophisticated visual systems that include one or more usually both of [[compound eye]]s and pigment-cup [[ocelli]] (\"little eyes\"). In most cases ocelli are only capable of detecting the direction from which light is coming, using the shadow cast by the walls of the cup. However, the main eyes of [[spider]]s are pigment-cup ocelli that are capable of forming images,<ref name=\"RuppertFoxBarnes2004P532To537\" /> and those of [[jumping spider]]s can rotate to track prey.<ref>[[#refRuppert|Ruppert, Fox & Barnes (2004)]], pp. 578\u2013580</ref>\n\nCompound eyes consist of fifteen to several thousand independent [[ommatidia]], columns that are usually [[hexagon]]al in [[Cross section (geometry)|cross section]]. Each ommatidium is an independent sensor, with its own light-sensitive cells and often with its own [[lens (anatomy)|lens]] and [[cornea]].<ref name=\"RuppertFoxBarnes2004P532To537\" /> Compound eyes have a wide field of view, and can detect fast movement and, in some cases, the [[light polarization|polarization of light]].<ref>{{citation\n |url=http://www.suss-microoptics.com/downloads/Publications/Miniaturized_Imaging_Systems.pdf \n |doi=10.1016/S0167-9317(03)00102-3 \n |title=Miniaturized imaging systems \n |author1=V\u00f6lkel, R. \n |author2=Eisner, M. \n |author3=Weible, K.

The self-righting behavior of [[cockroach]]es is triggered when pressure sensors on the underside of the feet report no pressure. However, many [[malacostracan]] crustaceans have [[statocyst]]s, which provide the same sort of information as the balance and motion sensors of the vertebrate [[inner ear]].<ref name=\"RuppertFoxBarnes2004P532To537\" />\n\nThe [[proprioceptor]]s of arthropods, sensors that report the force exerted by muscles and the degree of bending in the body and joints, are well understood.

[[Opiliones]] (harvestmen), [[millipede]]s, and some crustaceans use modified appendages such as [[gonopod]]s or [[Opiliones penis|penises]] to transfer the sperm directly to the female. However, most male [[terrestrial animal|terrestrial]] arthropods produce [[spermatophore]]s, waterproof packets of [[sperm]], which the females take into their bodies.

Instead, they proposed that three separate groups of \"arthropods\" evolved separately from common worm-like ancestors: the [[chelicerate]]s, including [[spider]]s and [[scorpion]]s; the crustaceans; and the [[uniramia]], consisting of [[onychophoran]]s, [[myriapod]]s and [[hexapoda|hexapods]]. These arguments usually bypassed [[trilobite]]s, as the evolutionary relationships of this class were unclear. Proponents of polyphyly argued the following: that the similarities between these groups are the results of [[convergent evolution]], as natural consequences of having rigid, segmented [[exoskeleton]]s; that the three groups use different chemical means of hardening the cuticle; that there were significant differences in the construction of their compound eyes; that it is hard to see how such different configurations of segments and appendages in the head could have evolved from the same ancestor; and that crustaceans have [[biramous]] limbs with separate gill and leg branches, while the other two groups have [[uniramous]] limbs in which the single branch serves as a leg.<ref>{{citation |author=Gillott, C. |title=Entomology |pages=17\u201319 |publisher=Springer |year=1995 |isbn=978-0-306-44967-3}}</ref>\n<div style=\"float:right; width:auto; max-width:100%; border:solid 1px silver; padding:2px; margin:2px; font-size:80%;\">\n<div style=\"width:auto; border:solid 1px silver; padding:5px\">\n{{clade\n |1={{clade\n    |1=[[onychophora]]ns,<br />including ''[[Aysheaia]]'' and ''[[Peripatus]]''\n    |2={{clade\n      |1={{clade\n          |1=armored [[lobopod]]s,<br />including ''[[Hallucigenia]]'' and ''[[Microdictyon]]''\n          |2={{clade\n              |1=[[anomalocarid]]-like taxa,<br />including modern [[tardigrade]]s as<br />well as extinct animals like<br />''[[Kerygmachela]]'' and ''[[Opabinia]]''\n              |2={{clade\n                  |1=''[[Anomalocaris]]''\n                  |2=arthropods,<br />including living groups and<br />extinct forms such as [[trilobite]]s\n                 }}\n             }}\n         }}\n       }}\n    }}\n}}\n</div>Simplified summary of Budd's \"broad-scale\" cladogram (1996)<ref name=\"Budd1996\" /></div>\nFurther analysis and discoveries in the 1990s reversed this view, and led to acceptance that arthropods are [[monophyletic]], in other words they do share a common ancestor that was itself an arthropod.<ref>{{citation |author=Adrain, J. |title=Book Review: Arthropod Fossils and Phylogeny, edited by Gregory D.

The earliest known arthropods ate mud in order to extract food particles from it, and possessed variable numbers of segments with unspecialized appendages that functioned as both gills and legs. Anomalocarids were, by the standards of the time, huge and sophisticated predators with specialized mouths and grasping appendages, fixed numbers of segments some of which were specialized, tail fins, and gills that were very different from those of arthropods. This reasoning implies that ''[[Parapeytoia]]'', which has legs and a backward-pointing mouth like that of the earliest arthropods, is a more credible closest relative of arthropods than is ''[[Anomalocaris]]''.<ref>{{citation |author1=Bergstr\u00f6m, J. |author2=Hou, X.-G. |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Arthropod origins |journal=[[Bulletin of Geosciences]] |volume=78 |issue=4 |pages=323\u2013334 |year=2003 |url=http://www.geology.cz/bulletin/contents/2003/vol79no4/323_bergstrom.pdf |access-date=2008-10-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081216220103/http://www.geology.cz/bulletin/contents/2003/vol79no4/323_bergstrom.pdf |archive-date=2008-12-16 |url-status=live }}</ref> In 2006, they suggested that arthropods were more closely related to [[lobopod]]s and [[tardigrade]]s than to anomalocarids.<ref>{{citation |author1=Hou, X.-G. |author2=Bergstr\u00f6m, J. |author3=Jie, Y. |last-author-amp=yes |title=Distinguishing anomalocaridids from arthropods and priapulids |journal=[[Geological Journal]] |volume=41 |issue=3\u20134 |pages=259\u2013269 |year=2006 |doi=10.1002/gj.1050}}</ref> In 2014, research indicated that tardigrades were more closely related to arthropods than velvet worms.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/misunderstood-worm-like-fossil-finds-its-place-in-the-tree-of-life|title=Misunderstood worm-like fossil finds its place in the Tree of Life|date=17 August 2014|access-date=24 January 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170107150001/http://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/misunderstood-worm-like-fossil-finds-its-place-in-the-tree-of-life|archive-date=7 January 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n{{clear}}\n<div style=\"float:right; width:auto; max-width:100%; border:solid 1px silver; padding:2px; margin:2px; font-size:80%;\">\n<div style=\"width:auto; border:solid 1px silver; padding:5px\">\n{{clade\n  |label1=[[Protostome]]s\n  |1={{clade\n|1=[[Chaetognatha]]\n|2={{clade\n       |1=[[Spiralia]] ([[annelid]]s, [[mollusc]]s, [[brachiopod]]s, etc.)\n       |label2=[[Ecdysozoa]]\n       |2={{clade\n            |1=[[Nematoida]] ([[nematode]]s and close relatives)\n            |2=[[Scalidophora]] ([[priapulid]]s and [[Kinorhyncha]], and [[Loricifera]])\n            |label3=[[Panarthropoda]]\n            |3={{clade\n                 |1=[[Onychophora]]ns\n                 |label2=[[Tactopoda]]\n                 |2={{clade\n                     |1=[[Tardigrade]]s\n                 |label2=Euarthropoda\n                 |2={{clade\n                      |1=[[Chelicerate]]s\n                      |label2=[[Mandibulata]]\n                      |2={{clade\n                           |1=\u2020[[Euthycarcinoid]]s\n                           |2={{clade\n                                |1=[[Myriapod]]s\n                                |label2=[[Pancrustacea]]\n                                |2={{clade\n                                     |1=[[Crustacean]]s\n                                     |2=[[Hexapoda|Hexapods]]\n                                    }}\n                              }}\n                         }}\n                    }}\n               }}\n          }}\n     }}\n}}\n}}\n}}\n</div>Relationships of Ecdysozoa to each other and to annelids, etc.,<ref name=\"TelfordBourlatEtAl2008EvolutionOfEcdysozoa\" /> including euthycarcinoids<ref name=\"Vaccari2004\">{{citation |author1=Vaccari, N.

There had been competing proposals that arthropods were closely related to other groups such as [[nematode]]s, [[priapulid]]s and [[tardigrade]]s, but these remained minority views because it was difficult to specify in detail the relationships between these groups.\n\nIn the 1990s, [[Molecular phylogenetics|molecular phylogenetic]] analyses of [[DNA]] sequences produced a coherent scheme showing arthropods as members of a [[superphylum]] labelled Ecdysozoa (\"animals that moult\"), which contained nematodes, priapulids and tardigrades but excluded annelids. This was backed up by studies of the anatomy and development of these animals, which showed that many of the features that supported the Articulata hypothesis showed significant differences between annelids and the earliest Panarthropods in their details, and some were hardly present at all in arthropods. This hypothesis groups annelids with molluscs and [[brachiopod]]s in another superphylum, [[Lophotrochozoa]].\n\nIf the Ecdysozoa hypothesis is correct, then segmentation of arthropods and annelids either has evolved [[Convergent evolution|convergently]] or has been inherited from a much older ancestor and subsequently lost in several other lineages, such as the non-arthropod members of the Ecdysozoa.<ref>{{citation |author1=Schmidt-Rhaesa, A. |author2=Bartolomaeus, T. |author3=Lemburg, C. |author4=Ehlers, U. |author5=Garey, J.

The term '''Arthropoda''' as originally proposed refers to a proposed grouping of Euarthropods and the phylum [[Onychophora]].\n\nArthropods are characterized by their jointed limbs and [[Arthropod cuticle|cuticle]] made of [[chitin]], often [[Mineralization (biology)|mineralised]] with [[calcium carbonate]]. The arthropod [[body plan]] consists of segments, each with a pair of appendages. The rigid cuticle inhibits growth, so arthropods replace it periodically by [[moulting]]. Arthropods are bilaterally symmetrical and their body possesses an [[exoskeleton|external skeleton]]. Some species have wings.\n\nTheir versatility has enabled arthropods to become the most species-rich members of all [[Guild (ecology)|ecological guilds]] in most environments. They have over a million described species, making up more than 80 percent of all described living animal species, some of which, unlike most other animals, are very successful in dry environments. Arthropods range in size from the microscopic crustacean ''[[Stygotantulus]]'' up to the [[Japanese spider crab]].\n\nAn arthropods' primary internal cavity is a [[haemocoel]], which accommodates their internal [[Organ (anatomy)|organs]], and through which their [[haemolymph]] \u2013 analogue of [[blood]] \u2013 circulates; they have [[Circulatory system#Open circulatory system|open circulatory systems]]. Like their exteriors, the internal organs of arthropods are generally built of repeated segments. Their [[nervous system]] is \"ladder-like\", with paired [[Anatomical terms of location#Dorsal and ventral|ventral]] [[Ventral nerve cord|nerve cords]] running through all segments and forming paired [[ganglia]] in each segment. Their heads are formed by fusion of varying numbers of segments, and their [[brain]]s are formed by fusion of the ganglia of these segments and encircle the [[esophagus]]. The [[respiratory system|respiratory]] and [[excretion|excretory]] systems of arthropods vary, depending as much on their environment as on the [[subphylum]] to which they belong. \n\nTheir vision relies on various combinations of [[compound eye]]s and pigment-pit [[ocelli]]: in most species the ocelli can only detect the direction from which light is coming, and the compound eyes are the main source of information, but the main eyes of [[spider]]s are ocelli that can form images and, in a few cases, can swivel to track prey. Arthropods also have a wide range of chemical and mechanical sensors, mostly based on modifications of the many bristles known as [[seta]]e that project through their cuticles.\n\nArthropods' methods of reproduction and development are diverse; all terrestrial species use [[internal fertilization]], but this is often by indirect transfer of the sperm via an appendage or the ground, rather than by direct injection. Aquatic species use either internal or [[external fertilization]]. Almost all arthropods lay eggs, but [[scorpion]]s give birth to live young after the eggs have hatched inside the mother. Arthropod hatchlings vary from miniature adults to grubs and [[caterpillar]]s that lack jointed limbs and eventually undergo a total [[metamorphosis]] to produce the adult form. The level of maternal care for hatchlings varies from nonexistent to the prolonged care provided by scorpions.\n\nThe evolutionary ancestry of arthropods dates back to the [[Cambrian]] period. The group is generally regarded as [[monophyletic]], and many analyses support the placement of arthropods with [[cycloneuralia]]ns (or their constituent clades) in a superphylum [[Ecdysozoa]]. Overall, however, the [[basal (evolution)|basal]] relationships of animals are not yet well resolved. Likewise, the relationships between various arthropod groups are still actively debated. \n\nArthropods contribute to the human food supply both directly as food, and more importantly indirectly as [[pollination|pollinators]] of crops.

Arthropods therefore replace their exoskeletons by undergoing [[ecdysis]] (moulting), or shedding the old exoskeleton after growing a new one that is not yet hardened. Moulting cycles run nearly continuously until an arthropod reaches full size.<ref name=\"RuppertFoxBarnes2004P523To524\">[[#refRuppert|Ruppert, Fox & Barnes (2004)]], pp. 523\u2013524</ref>\n\nThe developmental stages between each moult (ecdysis) until sexual maturity is reached is called an [[instar]]. Differences between instars can often be seen in altered body proportions, colors, patterns, changes in the number of body segments or head width. After moulting, i.e. shedding their exoskeleton, the juvenile arthropods continue in their life cycle until they either pupate or moult again.\n\nIn the initial phase of moulting, the animal stops feeding and its epidermis releases moulting fluid, a mixture of [[enzyme]]s that digests the [[endocuticle]] and thus detaches the old cuticle. This phase begins when the [[epidermis (zoology)|epidermis]] has secreted a new [[epicuticle]] to protect it from the enzymes, and the epidermis secretes the new exocuticle while the old cuticle is detaching. When this stage is complete, the animal makes its body swell by taking in a large quantity of water or air, and this makes the old cuticle split along predefined weaknesses where the old exocuticle was thinnest. It commonly takes several minutes for the animal to struggle out of the old cuticle. At this point, the new one is wrinkled and so soft that the animal cannot support itself and finds it very difficult to move, and the new endocuticle has not yet formed. The animal continues to pump itself up to stretch the new cuticle as much as possible, then hardens the new exocuticle and eliminates the excess air or water. By the end of this phase, the new endocuticle has formed. Many arthropods then eat the discarded cuticle to reclaim its materials.<ref name=\"RuppertFoxBarnes2004P523To524\" />\n\nBecause arthropods are unprotected and nearly immobilized until the new cuticle has hardened, they are in danger both of being trapped in the old cuticle and of being attacked by predators. Moulting may be responsible for 80 to 90% of all arthropod deaths.<ref name=\"RuppertFoxBarnes2004P523To524\" />\n\n=== Internal organs ===\n{{Annotated image/Basic arthropod internal structure}}\nArthropod bodies are also segmented internally, and the nervous, muscular, circulatory, and excretory systems have repeated components.<ref name=\"RuppertFoxBarnes2004P518\" /> Arthropods come from a lineage of animals that have a [[coelom]], a membrane-lined cavity between the gut and the body wall that accommodates the internal organs. The strong, segmented limbs of arthropods eliminate the need for one of the coelom's main ancestral functions, as a [[hydrostatic skeleton]], which muscles compress in order to change the animal's shape and thus enable it to move. Hence the coelom of the arthropod is reduced to small areas around the reproductive and excretory systems. Its place is largely taken by a [[hemocoel]], a cavity that runs most of the length of the body and through which [[blood]] flows.<ref name=\"RuppertFoxBarnes2004P527To528\">[[#refRuppert|Ruppert, Fox & Barnes (2004)]], pp. 527\u2013528</ref>\n\n=== Respiration and circulation ===\n{{See also|Hemolymph|hemocyte}}\nArthropods have open [[circulatory system]]s, although most have a few short, open-ended [[artery|arteries]]. In chelicerates and crustaceans, the blood carries [[oxygen]] to the tissues, while [[hexapoda|hexapods]] use a separate system of [[Invertebrate trachea|tracheae]]. Many crustaceans, but few chelicerates and [[tracheata|tracheates]], use [[respiratory pigment]]s to assist oxygen transport. The most common respiratory pigment in arthropods is [[copper]]-based [[hemocyanin]]; this is used by many crustaceans and a few [[centipede]]s. A few crustaceans and insects use iron-based [[hemoglobin]], the respiratory pigment used by [[vertebrate]]s. As with other invertebrates, the respiratory pigments of those arthropods that have them are generally dissolved in the blood and rarely enclosed in [[Blood cell|corpuscles]] as they are in vertebrates.<ref name=\"RuppertFoxBarnes2004P527To528\" />\n\nThe heart is typically a muscular tube that runs just under the back and for most of the length of the hemocoel. It contracts in ripples that run from rear to front, pushing blood forwards. Sections not being squeezed by the heart muscle are expanded either by elastic [[ligament]]s or by small [[muscle]]s, in either case connecting the heart to the body wall. Along the heart run a series of paired ostia, non-return valves that allow blood to enter the heart but prevent it from leaving before it reaches the front.<ref name=\"RuppertFoxBarnes2004P527To528\" />\n\nArthropods have a wide variety of respiratory systems. Small species often do not have any, since their high ratio of surface area to volume enables simple diffusion through the body surface to supply enough oxygen. Crustacea usually have gills that are modified appendages. Many arachnids have [[book lung]]s.<ref name=\"Garwood\" /> Tracheae, systems of branching tunnels that run from the openings in the body walls, deliver oxygen directly to individual cells in many insects, myriapods and [[arachnid]]s.<ref>[[#refRuppert|Ruppert, Fox & Barnes (2004)]], pp. 530, 733</ref>\n\n=== Nervous system ===\nLiving arthropods have paired main nerve cords running along their bodies below the gut, and in each segment the cords form a pair of [[ganglia]] from which [[sensory nerve|sensory]] and [[motor nerve|motor]] nerves run to other parts of the segment. Although the pairs of ganglia in each segment often appear physically fused, they are connected by [[commissure]]s (relatively large bundles of nerves), which give arthropod nervous systems a characteristic \"ladder-like\" appearance. The brain is in the head, encircling and mainly ''above'' the esophagus. It consists of the fused ganglia of the acron and one or two of the foremost segments that form the head&nbsp;\u2013 a total of three pairs of ganglia in most arthropods, but only two in chelicerates, which do not have antennae or the ganglion connected to them. The ganglia of other head segments are often close to the brain and function as part of it. In insects these other head ganglia combine into a pair of [[subesophageal ganglia]], under and behind the esophagus. Spiders take this process a step further, as ''all'' the [[segmental ganglia]] are incorporated into the subesophageal ganglia, which occupy most of the space in the cephalothorax (front \"super-segment\").<ref name=\"RuppertFoxBarnes2004P531To532\">[[#refRuppert|Ruppert, Fox & Barnes (2004)]], pp. 531\u2013532</ref>\n\n=== Excretory system ===\nThere are two different types of arthropod excretory systems. In aquatic arthropods, the end-product of biochemical reactions that [[metabolism|metabolise]] [[nitrogen]] is [[ammonia]], which is so toxic that it needs to be diluted as much as possible with water. The ammonia is then eliminated via any permeable membrane, mainly through the gills.<ref name=\"Garwood\" /> All crustaceans use this system, and its high consumption of water may be responsible for the relative lack of success of crustaceans as land animals.<ref name=\"RuppertFoxBarnes2004P529To530\">[[#refRuppert|Ruppert, Fox & Barnes (2004)]], pp. 529\u2013530</ref> Various groups of terrestrial arthropods have independently developed a different system: the end-product of nitrogen metabolism is [[uric acid]], which can be excreted as dry material; the [[Malpighian tubule system]] filters the uric acid and other nitrogenous waste out of the blood in the hemocoel, and dumps these materials into the hindgut, from which they are expelled as [[feces]].<ref name=\"RuppertFoxBarnes2004P529To530\" /> Most aquatic arthropods and some terrestrial ones also have organs called [[nephridia]] (\"little [[kidney]]s\"), which extract other wastes for excretion as [[urine]].<ref name=\"RuppertFoxBarnes2004P529To530\" />\n\n=== Senses ===\n\n==== Optical ====\n{{main|Arthropod eye}}\nThe stiff [[cuticle]]s of arthropods would block out information about the outside world, except that they are penetrated by many sensors or connections from sensors to the nervous system. In fact, arthropods have modified their cuticles into elaborate arrays of sensors. Various touch sensors, mostly [[seta]]e, respond to different levels of force, from strong contact to very weak air currents. Chemical sensors provide equivalents of [[taste]] and [[Olfaction|smell]], often by means of setae. Pressure sensors often take the form of membranes that function as [[eardrum]]s, but are connected directly to nerves rather than to [[auditory ossicle]]s. The [[Antenna (biology)|antennae]] of most hexapods include sensor packages that monitor [[humidity]], moisture and temperature.<ref name=\"RuppertFoxBarnes2004P532To537\">[[#refRuppert|Ruppert, Fox & Barnes (2004)]], pp. 532\u2013537</ref>\n\n[[File:Wasp ocelli.JPG|240px|thumb|right|Head of a [[wasp]] with three ocelli (center), and compound eyes at the left and right]]\nMost arthropods have sophisticated visual systems that include one or more usually both of [[compound eye]]s and pigment-cup [[ocelli]] (\"little eyes\"). In most cases ocelli are only capable of detecting the direction from which light is coming, using the shadow cast by the walls of the cup. However, the main eyes of [[spider]]s are pigment-cup ocelli that are capable of forming images,<ref name=\"RuppertFoxBarnes2004P532To537\" /> and those of [[jumping spider]]s can rotate to track prey.<ref>[[#refRuppert|Ruppert, Fox & Barnes (2004)]], pp. 578\u2013580</ref>\n\nCompound eyes consist of fifteen to several thousand independent [[ommatidia]], columns that are usually [[hexagon]]al in [[Cross section (geometry)|cross section]].

The self-righting behavior of [[cockroach]]es is triggered when pressure sensors on the underside of the feet report no pressure.

Instead, they proposed that three separate groups of \"arthropods\" evolved separately from common worm-like ancestors: the [[chelicerate]]s, including [[spider]]s and [[scorpion]]s; the crustaceans; and the [[uniramia]], consisting of [[onychophoran]]s, [[myriapod]]s and [[hexapoda|hexapods]]. These arguments usually bypassed [[trilobite]]s, as the evolutionary relationships of this class were unclear. Proponents of polyphyly argued the following: that the similarities between these groups are the results of [[convergent evolution]], as natural consequences of having rigid, segmented [[exoskeleton]]s; that the three groups use different chemical means of hardening the cuticle; that there were significant differences in the construction of their compound eyes; that it is hard to see how such different configurations of segments and appendages in the head could have evolved from the same ancestor; and that crustaceans have [[biramous]] limbs with separate gill and leg branches, while the other two groups have [[uniramous]] limbs in which the single branch serves as a leg.<ref>{{citation |author=Gillott, C. |title=Entomology |pages=17\u201319 |publisher=Springer |year=1995 |isbn=978-0-306-44967-3}}</ref>\n<div style=\"float:right; width:auto; max-width:100%; border:solid 1px silver; padding:2px; margin:2px; font-size:80%;\">\n<div style=\"width:auto; border:solid 1px silver; padding:5px\">\n{{clade\n |1={{clade\n    |1=[[onychophora]]ns,<br />including ''[[Aysheaia]]'' and ''[[Peripatus]]''\n    |2={{clade\n      |1={{clade\n          |1=armored [[lobopod]]s,<br />including ''[[Hallucigenia]]'' and ''[[Microdictyon]]''\n          |2={{clade\n              |1=[[anomalocarid]]-like taxa,<br />including modern [[tardigrade]]s as<br />well as extinct animals like<br />''[[Kerygmachela]]'' and ''[[Opabinia]]''\n              |2={{clade\n                  |1=''[[Anomalocaris]]''\n                  |2=arthropods,<br />including living groups and<br />extinct forms such as [[trilobite]]s\n                 }}\n             }}\n         }}\n       }}\n    }}\n}}\n</div>Simplified summary of Budd's \"broad-scale\" cladogram (1996)<ref name=\"Budd1996\" /></div>\nFurther analysis and discoveries in the 1990s reversed this view, and led to acceptance that arthropods are [[monophyletic]], in other words they do share a common ancestor that was itself an arthropod.<ref>{{citation |author=Adrain, J. |title=Book Review: Arthropod Fossils and Phylogeny, edited by Gregory D.

The earliest known arthropods ate mud in order to extract food particles from it, and possessed variable numbers of segments with unspecialized appendages that functioned as both gills and legs. Anomalocarids were, by the standards of the time, huge and sophisticated predators with specialized mouths and grasping appendages, fixed numbers of segments some of which were specialized, tail fins, and gills that were very different from those of arthropods.

There had been competing proposals that arthropods were closely related to other groups such as [[nematode]]s, [[priapulid]]s and [[tardigrade]]s, but these remained minority views because it was difficult to specify in detail the relationships between these groups.\n\nIn the 1990s, [[Molecular phylogenetics|molecular phylogenetic]] analyses of [[DNA]] sequences produced a coherent scheme showing arthropods as members of a [[superphylum]] labelled Ecdysozoa (\"animals that moult\"), which contained nematodes, priapulids and tardigrades but excluded annelids. This was backed up by studies of the anatomy and development of these animals, which showed that many of the features that supported the Articulata hypothesis showed significant differences between annelids and the earliest Panarthropods in their details, and some were hardly present at all in arthropods. This hypothesis groups annelids with molluscs and [[brachiopod]]s in another superphylum, [[Lophotrochozoa]].\n\nIf the Ecdysozoa hypothesis is correct, then segmentation of arthropods and annelids either has evolved [[Convergent evolution|convergently]] or has been inherited from a much older ancestor and subsequently lost in several other lineages, such as the non-arthropod members of the Ecdysozoa.<ref>{{citation |author1=Schmidt-Rhaesa, A. |author2=Bartolomaeus, T. |author3=Lemburg, C. |author4=Ehlers, U. |author5=Garey, J.

In the space of a month, England were soundly defeated by [[Australia national rugby union team|Australia]] (76\u20130 in Brisbane on 6 June), twice by [[New Zealand national rugby union team|New Zealand]] (64\u201322 in Dunedin on 20 June and 40\u201310 in Auckland on 27 June) and finally by [[South Africa national rugby union team|South Africa]] (18\u20130 in Cape Town on 4 July).  There were also losses to New Zealand 'A', New Zealand Rugby Academy, and [[New Zealand M\u0101ori rugby union team|New Zealand M\u0101ori]].\n\nThe tour had benefits for some players, bringing through future stars of the England side such as Vickery himself, [[Jonny Wilkinson]], [[Danny Grewcock]], [[Graham Rowntree]], [[Austin Healey]], [[Matt Dawson]] and [[Matt Perry (rugby union)|Matt Perry]], others effectively had their international careers ended.  [[Steve Ravenscroft]], Rob Fidler, [[Jos Baxendell]], [[Spencer Brown (rugby player born 1973)|Spencer Brown]] and [[Tom Beim]] each gained two caps on the tour \u2013 and have not played for England since.  Richard Pool-Jones, Scott Benton, Dominic Chapman and [[Stuart Potter]] only played once for England, on the Tour From Hell.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/rugby_union/article825132.ece|title=Login|work=timesonline.co.uk}}</ref>\n\nVickery recovered from a neck injury in April 1999 and played in that year\u2019s [[1999 Rugby World Cup|Rugby World Cup]]. A shoulder injury, however, kept him out of the 2000 South Africa tour. Vickery toured Australia with the [[British and Irish Lions]] in 2001 and played in all three tests.\n\nVickery was appointed captain of the England squad that toured [[Argentina]] in 2002. With many of the top players rested, Vickery led the side to victory against [[Argentina national rugby union team|The Pumas]] in [[Buenos Aires]].\n\nVickery missed the [[2003 Six Nations Championship|2003 Six Nations]] tournament because of a back injury, but having returned to the team he did well for England on the road to the [[2003 Rugby World Cup|2003 World Cup]]. He played in all seven games in the tournament, which was won by England, and captained the side against Uruguay. He scored his first international try when he came off the bench against Samoa in England\u2019s third game of the tournament.\n\nA rib injury prevented him from captaining the non capped match against the [[New Zealand Barbarians]] in December 2003. Although he took a full part in the [[2004 Six Nations Championship|2004 Six Nations]], another back operation in May ruled him out of the summer tour to New Zealand and Australia. He returned to rugby only in late October 2004.\n\nMaking his international comeback, he came on as a replacement against South Africa for the first Autumn Test between the two sides on 18 November 2006.  After playing well, he drove over to score the winning try, which was converted by [[Andy Goode]], and England won their first game since February that year.\n\nHe was selected on 2 January by new England Head Coach [[Brian Ashton (rugby player)|Brian Ashton]] to captain the side during the [[2007 Six Nations]] and [[2007 Rugby World Cup]]. He was one of only four players to have started both the 2003 and 2007 RWC Finals, the other three being [[Jonny Wilkinson]], [[Jason Robinson (rugby player)|Jason Robinson]] and [[Ben Kay]].\n\nAlso, on 8 January 2008 he was selected in the squad for the [[2008 Six Nations Championship]] by Brian Ashton. He played every game except for the 23\u201319 win over Italy which he missed through injury. He was selected to tour South Africa with the 2009 British and Irish Lions, starting the first and third test. He took a merciless pounding from Tendai Mtawarira in the first test in particular, probably the worst of his career. To his credit, he performed admirably in the third test when he replaced the injured Adam Jones to start.\n\n==Personal life==\nVickery is married to Kate and they have two children.\n\nHe was a co-commentator for [[ITV Network|ITV]]'s coverage of the [[2011 Rugby World Cup]].\n\nVickery won the 2011 series of [[Celebrity Masterchef]] beating [[Kirsty Wark]] and [[Nick Pickard]] in the

In the space of a month, England were soundly defeated by [[Australia national rugby union team|Australia]] (76\u20130 in Brisbane on 6 June), twice by [[New Zealand national rugby union team|New Zealand]] (64\u201322 in Dunedin on 20 June and 40\u201310 in Auckland on 27 June) and finally by [[South Africa national rugby union team|South Africa]] (18\u20130 in Cape Town on 4 July).  There were also losses to New Zealand 'A', New Zealand Rugby Academy, and [[New Zealand M\u0101ori rugby union team|New Zealand M\u0101ori]].\n\nThe tour had benefits for some players, bringing through future stars of the England side such as Vickery himself, [[Jonny Wilkinson]], [[Danny Grewcock]], [[Graham Rowntree]], [[Austin Healey]], [[Matt Dawson]] and [[Matt Perry (rugby union)|Matt Perry]], others effectively had their international careers ended.  [[Steve Ravenscroft]], Rob Fidler, [[Jos Baxendell]], [[Spencer Brown (rugby player born 1973)|Spencer Brown]] and [[Tom Beim]] each gained two caps on the tour \u2013 and have not played for England since.  Richard Pool-Jones, Scott Benton, Dominic Chapman and [[Stuart Potter]] only played once for England, on the Tour From Hell.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/rugby_union/article825132.ece|title=Login|work=timesonline.co.uk}}</ref>\n\nVickery recovered from a neck injury in April 1999 and played in that year\u2019s [[1999 Rugby World Cup|Rugby World Cup]]. A shoulder injury, however, kept him out of the 2000 South Africa tour. Vickery toured Australia with the [[British and Irish Lions]] in 2001 and played in all three tests.\n\nVickery was appointed captain of the England squad that toured [[Argentina]] in 2002. With many of the top players rested, Vickery led the side to victory against [[Argentina national rugby union team|The Pumas]] in [[Buenos Aires]].\n\nVickery missed the [[2003 Six Nations Championship|2003 Six Nations]] tournament because of a back injury, but having returned to the team he did well for England on the road to the [[2003 Rugby World Cup|2003 World Cup]]. He played in all seven games in the tournament, which was won by England, and captained the side against Uruguay. He scored his first international try when he came off the bench against Samoa in England\u2019s third game of the tournament.\n\nA rib injury prevented him from captaining the non capped match against the [[New Zealand Barbarians]] in December 2003. Although he took a full part in the [[2004 Six Nations Championship|2004 Six Nations]], another back operation in May ruled him out of the summer tour to New Zealand and Australia. He returned to rugby only in late October 2004.\n\nMaking his international comeback, he came on as a replacement against South Africa for the first Autumn Test between the two sides on 18 November 2006.  After playing well, he drove over to score the winning try, which was converted by [[Andy Goode]], and England won their first game since February that year.\n\nHe was selected on 2 January by new England Head Coach [[Brian Ashton (rugby player)|Brian Ashton]] to captain the side during the [[2007 Six Nations]] and [[2007 Rugby World Cup]]. He was one of only four players to have started both the 2003 and 2007 RWC Finals, the other three being [[Jonny Wilkinson]], [[Jason Robinson (rugby player)|Jason Robinson]] and [[Ben Kay]].\n\nAlso, on 8 January 2008 he was selected in the squad for the [[2008 Six Nations Championship]] by Brian Ashton. He played every game except for the 23\u201319 win over Italy which he missed through injury. He was selected to tour South Africa with the 2009 British and Irish Lions, starting the first and third test. He took a merciless pounding from Tendai Mtawarira in the first test in particular, probably the worst of his career. To his credit, he performed admirably in the third test when he replaced the injured Adam Jones to start.\n\n==Personal life==\nVickery is married to Kate and they have two children.\n\nHe was a co-commentator for [[ITV Network|ITV]]'s coverage of the [[2011 Rugby World Cup]].\n\nVickery won the 2011 series of [[Celebrity Masterchef]] beating [[Kirsty Wark]] and [[Nick Pickard]] in the final.<ref>{{cite web|title=Celebrity MasterChef dishes up 2011 winner|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-15416954|website=BBC News|accessdate=7 May 2015|date=22 October 2011}}</ref>\n\nHe was appointed a Deputy Lieutenant of Gloucestershire in 2015.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.gloucestershirelive.co.uk/dame-janet-trotter-gloucestershire-8217-s-lord/story-26308504-detail/story.html|title=Ex-Gloucester Rugby star Phil Vickery among the Deputy Lord Lieutenants named for Gloucestershire|last=Qaiser|first=Maryam|date=9 April 2015|work=Gloucestershire Live|accessdate=16 December 2016}}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.htalentmanagement.com/client/phil-vickery Phil Vickery MBE DL Booking Agency]\n*[http://www.ragingbull.co.uk Vickery's range of clothing]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20110928205852/http://www.wasps.co.uk/playerdisplaySS.ink?skip=26&season=07%2F08&seasonl=2007%2F2008&playertype=P Wasps profile]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070822060937/http://www.england-rugby.com/englandrugby/index.cfm?fuseaction=News.News_Detail&storyid=4195 England profile]\n* [http://www.lcrfc.co.uk/ London Cornish RFC]\n\n{{s-start}}\n{{s-sports}}\n{{s-bef|before=[[Neil Back]]<br>[[Martin Johnson (rugby union)|Martin Johnson]]<br>[[Martin Corry (rugby union)|Martin Corry]]<br>[[Jonny Wilkinson]]<br>[[Mike Catt]]<br>[[Martin Corry (rugby union)|Martin Corry]]<br>[[Steve Borthwick]]}}\n{{s-ttl|title=English National Rugby Union Captain|years=Jun 2002<br>Nov 2003<br>Feb 2007<br>Aug 2007<br>Aug\u2013Sep 2007<br>Oct 2007 \u2013 Feb 2008<br>Feb\u2013Mar 2008}}\n{{s-aft|after=[[Martin Johnson (rugby union)|Martin Johnson]]<br>[[Martin Johnson (rugby union)|Martin Johnson]]<br>[[Mike Catt]]<br>[[Mike Catt]]<br>[[Martin Corry (rugby union)|Martin Corry]]<br>[[Steve Borthwick]]<br>[[Steve Borthwick]]}}\n{{end}}\n\n{{British and Irish Lions 2009}}\n{{England Squad 2007 World Cup}}\n{{England Squad 2003 World Cup}}\n{{British and Irish Lions 2001}}\n{{England Squad 1999 World Cup}}\n{{English national rugby union team captains}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Vickery, Phil}}\n[[Category:1976 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:Sportspeople from Barnstaple]]\n[[Category:English rugby union players]]\n[[Category:England international rugby union players]]\n[[Category:Gloucester Rugby players]]\n[[Category:Wasps RFC players]]\n[[Category:Rugby union props]]\n[[Category:Cornish sportspeople]]\n[[Category:Cornish rugby union players]]\n[[Category:British and Irish Lions rugby union players from England]]\n[[Category:Deputy Lieutenants of Gloucestershire]]\n[[Category:Members of the Order of the British Empire]]\n[[Category:Reality cooking competition winners]]\n[[Category:Sportspeople from Gloucestershire]]\n", "name_user": "Gazamp", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eExternal links:AddedPortal:Cornwall", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Vickery_(rugby_union)"}

The two groups were known to never provide any fake links, a problem that used to be quite prevalent on public bittorrent sites prior to improvements in community-powered filtering in recent years. A group of volunteers gathered in the [[Internet Relay Chat|IRC]] channel #EZTV on the [[EFnet]] IRC network to create a TV torrent group from scratch in order to fill this void in the public bittorrent scene.\n\nThe idea behind EZTV was to create a group that would pick up where its two predecessors left off while avoiding what they considered the \"weak spots\" that had brought them down. This meant that EZTV should never host its own torrent files, its leadership structure should be dynamic and opaque to avoid presenting any obvious target for litigation, and the group should not host or run its own [[BitTorrent tracker|tracker]].\n\nIn addition, it was decided that EZTV should be a purely non-profit group by never asking for money of any kind from its users and to never have advertisements to avoid \"profiting from piracy\" litigation. This means that EZTV is run entirely on a volunteer basis. This clean, no-ads profile of EZTV has made the site a popular destination for the public torrent scene.\n\n===EZTVEFNET.org===\n\nDuring its first years of operation, EZTV hosted its site under the domain name eztvefnet.org. However, in October 2007 that domain began redirecting to a [[Google]] query for \"eztv\".

The two groups were known to never provide any fake links, a problem that used to be quite prevalent on public bittorrent sites prior to improvements in community-powered filtering in recent years. A group of volunteers gathered in the [[Internet Relay Chat|IRC]] channel #EZTV on the [[EFnet]] IRC network to create a TV torrent group from scratch in order to fill this void in the public bittorrent scene.\n\nThe idea behind EZTV was to create a group that would pick up where its two predecessors left off while avoiding what they considered the \"weak spots\" that had brought them down. This meant that EZTV should never host its own torrent files, its leadership structure should be dynamic and opaque to avoid presenting any obvious target for litigation, and the group should not host or run its own [[BitTorrent tracker|tracker]].\n\nIn addition, it was decided that EZTV should be a purely non-profit group by never asking for money of any kind from its users and to never have advertisements to avoid \"profiting from piracy\" litigation. This means that EZTV is run entirely on a volunteer basis. This clean, no-ads profile of EZTV has made the site a popular destination for the public torrent scene.\n\n===EZTVEFNET.org===\n\nDuring its first years of operation, EZTV hosted its site under the domain name eztvefnet.org. However, in October 2007 that domain began redirecting to a [[Google]] query for \"eztv\". Citing \"administrative issues\", EZTV had lost control over that domain and has redirected users to eztv.it.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://torrentfreak.com/eztv-now-accessible-under-new-domain-names-071028/ |title=EZTV Now Accessible Under New Domain Names |publisher=TorrentFreak |date=October 28, 2007 |accessdate=2012-03-16}}</ref> After the Italian authorities took down the EZTV.it domain, users were directed towards eztv.ch, until the eventual demise.\n\nIn April 2008 the old domain name was [[domain parking|parked]] and taken over by a different site.\n\n===Stability issues===\n\nBy many accounts, EZTV was for a few years plagued with several periods of \u2013 sometimes prolonged \u2013 [[downtime]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://torrentfreak.com/eztv-goes-down-again-110421/ |title=EZTV Goes Down Again |publisher=TorrentFreak |date=April 21, 2011 |accessdate=2012-03-16}}</ref><ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.currentlydown.com/eztv.it#chart-2014-07-05\n|title=EZTV down for 14 hours\n|accessdate=2014-07-14\n}}</ref>\n\n=== Pirate Bay Raid ===\n\nOn 9 December 2014, [[The Pirate Bay]] was raided by the [[Swedish police]], who seized servers, computers, and other equipment and resulted in EZTV going down.<ref name=\"WRD-20141209\">{{cite news |last=Zetter |first=Kim |title=Pirate Bay Has Been Raided and Taken Down: Here\u2019s What We Know |url=https://www.wired.com/2014/12/pirate-bay-raided-taken-down/ |date=9 December 2014 |work=[[Wired (website)|Wired]] |accessdate=9 December 2014 }}</ref>\n\nBy the 11th of December, EZTV was releasing torrents again although the main site was not yet accessible with the regular domain, however the site could be reached through eztv proxy sites.

{"title_page": "James Romig", "text_new": "{{Peacock|date=March 2020}}\n\n'''James Romig''' (born 1971) responds to an increasingly fragmented and accelerated world by creating highly self-referential works that evolve slowly and reveal themselves gradually. Endeavoring to reflect the intricacies of the natural world, his compositional designs exert influence on both small-scale iteration and large-scale structure, obscuring boundaries between form and content. Critics have described his music as \u201crapturous, slow-moving beauty\u201d ([[San Francisco Chronicle]]), and \"developing with the naturalness of breathing\" ([[The New Yorker]]). His ''Still'', for solo piano, was a finalist for the 2019 [[Pulitzer Prize for Music|Pulitzer Prize in Music]]. His works have been performed \u2014 in 49 states and 34 countries \u2014 by such notables as the [[Quad City Symphony Orchestra|Quad City Symphony]], Talujon, Duo Harpverk, Iktus, [[JACK Quartet|JACK]], Khasma Duo, Ensemble Chronophonie, Altered Sound, Suono Mobile, Cadillac Moon, Due East, Collide-O-Scope, flutists John McMurtery and [[Harvey Sollberger]], percussionists Tom Kolor and Doug Perkins, and pianists Louis Goldstein, Taka Kigawa, and Ashlee Mack. Recordings have been released by [[New World Records|New World]], Navona, Blue Griffin, and [[Perspectives of New Music]]. Guest-composer visits include Eastman, Buffalo, Cincinnati, Bowling Green, Illinois, Northwestern, and the [[American Academy in Rome]]. Artist residencies include [[Aaron Copland House|Copland House]], Centrum, [[Everglades National Park|Everglades]], [[Grand Canyon National Park|Grand Canyon]], and [[Petrified Forest National Park|Petrified Forest]] National Parks. He holds degrees from the [[University of Iowa]] (BM, MM) and [[Rutgers University]] (PhD), where he studied with [[Charles Wuorinen]]. [[Milton Babbitt]] provided additional mentoring and served on Romig's PhD dissertation committee. Romig has been on faculty at [[Western Illinois University]] since 2002. His music is published exclusively by Parallax Music Press (ASCAP).\n\n==Significant Achievements==\n\n*2019 [[Pulitzer Prize for Music|Pulitzer Prize in Music]], finalist (''Still'', for solo piano)\n*2019 [[Aaron Copland House|Copland House]] Award and Residency\n*2019 Petrified Forest National Park, Artist in Residence\n*2018 Guest Co-Editor of [[Perspectives of New Music]] issue celebrating [[Charles Wuorinen]]'s 80th year\n*2017 Everglades National Park, Artist in Residence\n*2012 Grand Canyon National Park, Artist in Residence\n*2011 [[Aaron Copland House|Copland House]] Award and Residency\n*2009 Petrified Forest National Park, Artist in Residence\n\n==Significant Works==\n\n*''Still'' (2016) for solo piano [Finalist for the 2019 [[Pulitzer Prize for Music|Pulitzer Prize in Music]]]\n*''Petrified Spaces | Spaces | Spaces Petrified'' (2019) for alto saxophone and vibraphone\n*''Replicas'' (2019) for piano and orchestra [commissioned by the Waterloo\u2013Cedar Falls Symphony]\n*''Palindragram'' (2018) for solo flute\n*''Onomatopieces'' (2017) for percussion\n*''Pynes'' (2016) for flute and piano\n*''Angles of Response'' (2015) for clarinet and piano\n*''Bridges'' (2014) for orchestra [commissioned for the 100th anniversary of the [[Quad City Symphony Orchestra|Quad City Symphony]]]\n*''The Line Begins to Blur'' (2014) for vibraphone and piano\n*''Time Seems to Pass'' (2013) for two pianos\n*''Dorsia 2a'' (2013) for vibraphone and harp [commissioned by Duo Harpverk]\n*''Out Of Frame'' (2012) for marimba trio\n*''Leaves From Modern Trees'' (2011) for flute and piano\n*''Disposition/Reflection'' (2011) for solo piano\n*''Glaciers'' (2009) for orchestra\n*''Recall Coordinator'' (2008) for flute and vibraphone\n*''Second Piano Sonata'' (2007) for solo piano\n*''Small Worlds'' (2006) for flute, clarinet, violin, cello, piano\n*''Ferocious Alphabets'' (2005) for clarinet and violin\n*A Slightly Evil Machine (2005) for percussion\n*''Piano Sonata'' (2004) for solo piano\n*''Transparencies'' (2004) for solo piano\n*''The Frame Problem'' (2003) for percussion trio)\n*''Islands That Never Were'' (2003) for vibraphone and piano\n*''Oiseau Mir\u00f3'' (2001) for flute\n*''Variations'' (1999) for string quartet\n*''Vibraphone Sonata'' (1997)\n*''Block'' (1996) for percussion\n\n==Discography==\n*''Still''.

Endeavoring to reflect the intricacies of the natural world, his compositional designs exert influence on both small-scale iteration and large-scale structure, obscuring boundaries between form and content. Critics have described his music as \u201crapturous, slow-moving beauty\u201d ([[San Francisco Chronicle]]), and \"developing with the naturalness of breathing\" ([[The New Yorker]]). His ''Still'', for solo piano, was a finalist for the 2019 [[Pulitzer Prize for Music|Pulitzer Prize in Music]]. His works have been performed \u2014 in 49 states and 34 countries \u2014 by such notables as the [[Quad City Symphony Orchestra|Quad City Symphony]], Talujon, Duo Harpverk, Iktus, [[JACK Quartet|JACK]], Khasma Duo, Ensemble Chronophonie, Altered Sound, Suono Mobile, Cadillac Moon, Due East, Collide-O-Scope, flutists John McMurtery and [[Harvey Sollberger]], percussionists Tom Kolor and Doug Perkins, and pianists Louis Goldstein, Taka Kigawa, and Ashlee Mack. Recordings have been released by [[New World Records|New World]], Navona, Blue Griffin, and [[Perspectives of New Music]]. Guest-composer visits include Eastman, Buffalo, Cincinnati, Bowling Green, Illinois, Northwestern, and the [[American Academy in Rome]]. Artist residencies include [[Aaron Copland House|Copland House]], Centrum, [[Everglades National Park|Everglades]], [[Grand Canyon National Park|Grand Canyon]], and [[Petrified Forest National Park|Petrified Forest]] National Parks. He holds degrees from the [[University of Iowa]] (BM, MM) and [[Rutgers University]] (PhD), where he studied with [[Charles Wuorinen]]. [[Milton Babbitt]] provided additional mentoring and served on Romig's PhD dissertation committee. Romig has been on faculty at [[Western Illinois University]] since 2002. His music is published exclusively by Parallax Music Press (ASCAP).\n\n==Significant Achievements==\n\n*2019 [[Pulitzer Prize for Music|Pulitzer Prize in Music]], finalist (''Still'', for solo piano)\n*2019 [[Aaron Copland House|Copland House]] Award and Residency\n*2019 Petrified Forest National Park, Artist in Residence\n*2018 Guest Co-Editor of [[Perspectives of New Music]] issue celebrating [[Charles Wuorinen]]'s 80th year\n*2017 Everglades National Park, Artist in Residence\n*2012 Grand Canyon National Park, Artist in Residence\n*2011 [[Aaron Copland House|Copland House]] Award and Residency\n*2009 Petrified Forest National Park, Artist in Residence\n\n==Significant Works==\n\n*''Still'' (2016) for solo piano [Finalist for the 2019 [[Pulitzer Prize for Music|Pulitzer Prize in Music]]]\n*''Petrified Spaces | Spaces | Spaces Petrified'' (2019) for alto saxophone and vibraphone\n*''Replicas'' (2019) for piano and orchestra [commissioned by the Waterloo\u2013Cedar Falls Symphony]\n*''Palindragram'' (2018) for solo flute\n*''Onomatopieces'' (2017) for percussion\n*''Pynes'' (2016) for flute and piano\n*''Angles of Response'' (2015) for clarinet and piano\n*''Bridges'' (2014) for orchestra [commissioned for the 100th anniverary of the [[Quad City Symphony Orchestra|Quad City Symphony]]]\n*''The Line Begins to Blur'' (2014) for vibraphone and piano\n*''Time Seems to Pass'' (2013) for two pianos\n*''Dorsia 2a'' (2013) for vibraphone and harp [commissioned by Duo Harpverk]\n*''Out Of Frame'' (2012) for marimba trio\n*''Leaves From Modern Trees'' (2011) for flute and piano\n*''Disposition/Reflection'' (2011) for solo piano\n*''Glaciers'' (2009) for orchestra\n*''Recall Coordinator'' (2008) for flute and vibraphone\n*''Second Piano Sonata'' (2007) for solo piano\n*''Small Worlds'' (2006) for flute, clarinet, violin, cello, piano\n*''Ferocious Alphabets'' (2005) for clarinet and violin\n*A Slightly Evil Machine (2005) for percussion\n*''Piano Sonata'' (2004) for solo piano\n*''Transparencies'' (2004) for solo piano\n*''The Frame Problem'' (2003) for percussion trio)\n*''Islands That Never Were'' (2003) for vibraphone and piano\n*''Oiseau Mir\u00f3'' (2001) for flute\n*''Variations'' (1999) for string quartet\n*''Vibraphone Sonata'' (1997)\n*''Block'' (1996) for percussion\n\n==Discography==\n*''Still''.

Records]]. The song became an instant success in the United States, peaking at No. 3 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] popular music singles chart on August 13<ref>[[Joel Whitburn]], ''The Billboard Book of Top 40 Hits'', Billboard Publications, 1983.</ref>, No. 1 on the [[Cash Box Top 100]] charts, No. 2 in Canada, and reaching No. 4 on the [[UK Singles Chart]].<ref>''Joel Whitburn's Top Pop Singles 1955-1990'' - {{ISBN|0-89820-089-X}}</ref>\n\n== Lyrics ==\nThe lyrics appear to describe a man's mental anguish after a break-up with a woman, and his descent into madness leading to his committal to a \"funny farm\" (slang for a [[psychiatric hospital|mental hospital]]). It\u2019s finally revealed in last line of the third verse that he\u2019s not being driven insane by the loss of a woman \u2014 but by a runaway dog: \"They'll find you yet and when they do, they'll put you in the [[American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals|ASPCA]], you mangy mutt\". According to Samuels, he was concerned the record could be seen as making fun of the mentally ill, and intentionally added that line so \"you realize that the person is talking about a dog having left him, not a human\". Said Samuels, \"I felt it would cause some people to say 'Well, it's alright.' And it did. It worked.\"<ref name=\"Crouse2000\">{{cite book|author=Richard Crouse|title=Big Bang, Baby: Rock Trivia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dYFv3ifE0f4C&pg=PA91|date=26 April 2000|publisher=Dundurn|isbn=978-0-88882-219-2|pages=91\u2013}}</ref><ref name=\"Crouse2012\">{{cite book|author=Richard Crouse|title=Who Wrote The Book Of Love?|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OyZyWKcmRhEC&pg=PT70|date=15 March 2012|publisher=Doubleday Canada|isbn=978-0-385-67442-3|pages=70\u2013}}</ref>\n\n== Song structure ==\nThe song is driven by a [[snare drum]], [[tambourine]] and hand clap rhythm. The vocal is spoken rhythmically rather than sung melodically, while the vocal pitch rises and falls at key points to create an unusual [[glissando]] effect, augmented by the sound of wailing sirens.<ref name=\"Crouse2012\" /><ref name=\"SF1\" /> \n\n== Technical background ==\nAccording to Samuels, the vocal glissando was achieved by manipulating the recording speed of his vocal track, a multitrack variation on the technique used by [[Ross Bagdasarian, Sr.|Ross Bagdasarian]] in creating the original [[The Chipmunks|Chipmunks]] novelty songs.<ref name=\"Crouse2012\" /> At the time the song was written, Samuels was working as a recording engineer at Associated Recording Studios in New York. Samuels discovered he could use a [[Variable Frequency Oscillator]] to alter the 60\u00a0[[Hz]] [[Utility frequency|frequency]] of the [[Synchronous_motor#Hysteresis_motors|hysteresis motor]] of a [[Multitrack recording|multitrack]] tape recording machine in order to raise or lower the pitch of a voice without changing the tempo. This gave him the idea for a song based on the rhythm of the old Scottish tune \"[[The Campbells Are Coming]]\". After recording a percussion track at the standard speed, he played it back through headphones while recording the vocal on another track and gradually adjusting the VFO and the pace of his vocals to produce the desired effect. Some tracks were treated with intermittent tape-based echo effects created by an [[Echoplex]]. Samuels also layered in siren effects that gradually rose and fell with the pitch of his vocals.<ref name=\"Everett2008\">{{cite book|author=Walter Everett|title=The Foundations of Rock: From \"Blue Suede Shoes\" to \"Suite: Judy Blue Eyes\"|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P3NMCAAAQBAJ&pg=PT485|date=9 December 2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-029497-7|pages=485\u2013}}</ref><ref name=\"SF1\">{{cite web |title=They're Coming To Take Me Away, Ha-haaa by Napoleon XIV |url=https://www.songfacts.com/facts/napoleon-xiv/theyre-coming-to-take-me-away-ha-haaa |website=SongFacts.com |publisher=SongFacts |accessdate=17 June 2019}}</ref>\n\n== B-side ==\nContinuing the theme of insanity, the flip or [[B-side]] of the single was simply the A-side [[backmasking|played in reverse]], and given the title \"!aaaH-aH ,yawA eM ekaT oT gnimoC er'yehT\" (or \"<span style=\"transform: scaleX(-1); display: inline-block;\">Ha-Haaa!</span> <span style=\"transform: scaleX(-1); display: inline-block;\">Away,</span> <span style=\"transform: scaleX(-1); display: inline-block;\">Me</span> <span style=\"transform: scaleX(-1); display: inline-block;\">Take</span> <span style=\"transform: scaleX(-1); display: inline-block;\">to</span> <span style=\"transform: scaleX(-1); display: inline-block;\">Coming</span> <span style=\"transform: scaleX(-1); display: inline-block;\">They're</span>\") and the performer billed as \"<span style=\"transform: scaleX(-1); display: inline-block;\">XIV</span> <span style=\"transform: scaleX(-1); display: inline-block;\">NAPOLEON</span>\".

Only the label name, disclaimer, and record and recording master numbers were kept frontward.

([[Jos\u00e9phine de Beauharnais|Josephine]] was the name of the spouse of the French Emperor [[Napoleon Bonaparte]].)\n\nA variation of \"They're Coming to Take Me Away, Ha-Haaa!\" was also done by Jerry Samuels, from that same album entitled ''Where the Nuts hunt the Squirrels'', where Samuels, towards the end of the track, repeats the line: \"THEY'RE TRYING TO DRIVE ME SANE!!!

It was included on a single two years later on the ''Collectables'' label.

Records]]. The song became an instant success in the United States, peaking at No. 3 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] popular music singles chart on August 13<ref>[[Joel Whitburn]], ''The Billboard Book of Top 40 Hits'', Billboard Publications, 1983.</ref>, No. 1 on the [[Cash Box Top 100]] charts, No. 2 in Canada, and reaching No. 4 on the [[UK Singles Chart]].<ref>''Joel Whitburn's Top Pop Singles 1955-1990'' - {{ISBN|0-89820-089-X}}</ref>\n\n== Lyrics ==\nThe lyrics appear to describe a man's mental anguish after a break-up with a woman, and his descent into madness leading to his committal to a \"funny farm\" (slang for a [[psychiatric hospital|mental hospital]]). It\u2019s finally revealed in last line of the third verse that he\u2019s not being driven insane by the loss of a woman \u2014 but by a runaway dog: \"They'll find you yet and when they do, they'll put you in the [[American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals|ASPCA]], you mangy mutt\". According to Samuels, he was concerned the record could be seen as making fun of the mentally ill, and intentionally added that line so \"you realize that the person is talking about a dog having left him, not a human\". Said Samuels, \"I felt it would cause some people to say 'Well, it's alright.' And it did. It worked.\"<ref name=\"Crouse2000\">{{cite book|author=Richard Crouse|title=Big Bang, Baby: Rock Trivia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dYFv3ifE0f4C&pg=PA91|date=26 April 2000|publisher=Dundurn|isbn=978-0-88882-219-2|pages=91\u2013}}</ref><ref name=\"Crouse2012\">{{cite book|author=Richard Crouse|title=Who Wrote The Book Of Love?|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OyZyWKcmRhEC&pg=PT70|date=15 March 2012|publisher=Doubleday Canada|isbn=978-0-385-67442-3|pages=70\u2013}}</ref>\n\n== Song structure ==\nThe song is driven by a [[snare drum]], [[tambourine]] and hand clap rhythm. The vocal is spoken rhythmically rather than sung melodically, while the vocal pitch rises and falls at key points to create an unusual [[glissando]] effect, augmented by the sound of wailing sirens.<ref name=\"Crouse2012\" /><ref name=\"SF1\" /> \n\n== Technical background ==\nAccording to Samuels, the vocal glissando was achieved by manipulating the recording speed of his vocal track, a multitrack variation on the technique used by [[Ross Bagdasarian, Sr.|Ross Bagdasarian]] in creating the original [[The Chipmunks|Chipmunks]] novelty songs.<ref name=\"Crouse2012\" /> At the time the song was written, Samuels was working as a recording engineer at Associated Recording Studios in New York. Samuels discovered he could use a [[Variable Frequency Oscillator]] to alter the 60[[Hz]] [[Utility frequency|frequency]] of the [[Synchronous_motor#Hysteresis_motors|hysteresis motor]] of a [[Multitrack recording|multitrack]] tape recording machine in order to raise or lower the pitch of a voice without changing the tempo. This gave him the idea for a song based on the rhythm of the old Scottish tune \"[[The Campbells Are Coming]]\". After recording a percussion track at the standard speed, he played it back through headphones while recording the vocal on another track and gradually adjusting the VFO and the pace of his vocals to produce the desired effect. Some tracks were treated with intermittent tape-based echo effects created by an [[Echoplex]]. Samuels also layered in siren effects that gradually rose and fell with the pitch of his vocals.<ref name=\"Everett2008\">{{cite book|author=Walter Everett|title=The Foundations of Rock: From \"Blue Suede Shoes\" to \"Suite: Judy Blue Eyes\"|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P3NMCAAAQBAJ&pg=PT485|date=9 December 2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-029497-7|pages=485\u2013}}</ref><ref name=\"SF1\">{{cite web |title=They're Coming To Take Me Away, Ha-haaa by Napoleon XIV |url=https://www.songfacts.com/facts/napoleon-xiv/theyre-coming-to-take-me-away-ha-haaa |website=SongFacts.com |publisher=SongFacts |accessdate=17 June 2019}}</ref>\n\n== B-side ==\nContinuing the theme of insanity, the flip or [[B-side]] of the single was simply the A-side [[backmasking|played in reverse]], and given the title \"!aaaH-aH ,yawA eM ekaT oT gnimoC er'yehT\" (or \"<span style=\"transform: scaleX(-1); display: inline-block;\">Ha-Haaa!</span> <span style=\"transform: scaleX(-1); display: inline-block;\">Away,</span> <span style=\"transform: scaleX(-1); display: inline-block;\">Me</span> <span style=\"transform: scaleX(-1); display: inline-block;\">Take</span> <span style=\"transform: scaleX(-1); display: inline-block;\">to</span> <span style=\"transform: scaleX(-1); display: inline-block;\">Coming</span> <span style=\"transform: scaleX(-1); display: inline-block;\">They're</span>\") and the performer billed as \"<span style=\"transform: scaleX(-1); display: inline-block;\">XIV</span> <span style=\"transform: scaleX(-1); display: inline-block;\">NAPOLEON</span>\".
