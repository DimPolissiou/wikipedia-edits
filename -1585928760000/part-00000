He appears in several [[Mahayana sutras]], and in some sutras, is used as a counterpoint to represent the [[Hinayana]] school of Buddhism.  \n\nBuddhist texts relate that \u015a\u0101riputra and Maudgaly\u0101yana were childhood friends who became spiritual wanderers in their youth. After having searched for spiritual truth for a while, they came into contact with the teachings of the Buddha and ordained as monks under him, after which the Buddha declared the friends his two chief disciples. \u015a\u0101riputra was said to have attained enlightenment as an [[arahant|arhat]] two weeks after ordaining. As chief disciple \u015a\u0101riputra assumed a leadership role in the [[Sangha]], doing tasks like looking after monks, giving them objects of meditation, and clarifying points of doctrine. He was the first disciple the Buddha allowed to ordain other monks. \u015a\u0101riputra died shortly before the Buddha in his hometown and was cremated.

At that time, Sarada and his followers were visited by the past Buddha, [[Anomadassi Buddha|Anomadass\u012b,]] and were given a sermon given by Anomadass\u012b Buddha's chief disciples. Upon hearing the sermon from Anomadass\u012b Buddha's first chief disciple, Nisabha, Sarada became inspired and [[Adhi\u1e6d\u1e6dh\u0101na|resolved]] to become the first chief disciple of a future Buddha. He then made this wish in front of Anomadass\u012b Buddha, who declared that his aspiration will come true. Upon hearing the prediction, Sarada went to his close friend Sirivaddhana and asked him to resolve to become the second chief disciple of the same Buddha. Sirivaddhana then made a large offering to Anomadass\u012b Buddha and his following and made the wish as suggested.{{sfn|Hecker|Nyanaponika Thera|2003|p=58-61}} The two friends then spent the rest of their lives and several future lives doing good deeds.{{sfn|Malalasekera|2007|p=542}} According to Buddhist legend, the wish came true in the time of Gautama Buddha with Sarada being reborn as \u015a\u0101riputra and Sirivaddhana being reborn as Maudgaly\u0101yana.{{sfn|Hecker|Nyanaponika Thera|2003|p=58-61}}{{sfn|Malalasekera|2007|p=542}}\n\n== Biography ==\n\n=== Early life ===\nBuddhist texts describe that \u015a\u0101riputra was born with the birth name Upati\u1e63ya ([[Pali]]: ''Upatissa'') to a  wealthy [[Brahmin#In Buddhist and Jaina texts|Brahmin]] family in a village near [[R\u0101jagaha]] in the ancient Indian kingdom of [[Magadha]].{{sfn|Hecker|Nyanaponika Thera|2003|p=521}}{{sfn|Silk|2019|p=410}}{{sfn|Sayadaw|1990}} He is described as having had a \"golden complexion\".{{sfn|Shaw|2013|p=458}}{{sfn|Shaw|2006|p=36}}\n\nTexts from the [[Mulasarvastivada]] tradition state he was named after his father, while the [[Pali]] commentaries of the [[Theravada]] tradition state he was named after his birth village.{{sfn|Silk|2019|p=410}}{{refn|Some Pali texts contradict this however and state his birth village as N\u0101laka,{{sfn|Silk|2019|p=410}} although this may be an alternative name for Upatissa.{{sfn|Hecker|Nyanaponika Thera|2003|p=521}}|group=note}} Upati\u1e63ya had six siblings; three brothers named Upasena, Cunda and Revata, and three sisters named C\u0101la, Upac\u0101l\u0101 and S\u012bsupac\u0101l\u0101.

According to Buddhist academic [[Reginald Ray]], \u015a\u0101riputra was the greatest [[arhat]] in the [[P\u0101li Canon|Pali Canon]] and is ranked in the canon as being close to a second Buddha.{{sfn|Ray|1994|p=131-133}} In one text, he is referred to as \"King of the Dharma\" (Sanskrit: ''Dharmaraja'') a title generally reserved for the Buddha, and is described in several texts as one who \"spins the wheel of the Dharma\", a prerogative generally associated with Buddhas.{{sfn|Migot|1954|p=412, 500-501}} In the Pali Canon, \u015a\u0101riputra is credited as the main expounder of several [[suttas]], due to the Buddha trusting in his profound teaching ability.{{sfn|Wayman|1997|p=212}} Indologist [[Alex Wayman]] describes \u015a\u0101riputra as being exemplary of the four [[Brahmavihara|brahma-vih\u0101r\u0101s]], and credits these virtues with why the Buddha entrusted him with leadership of the Sangha.{{sfn|Wayman|1997|p=212}}\n\nIn [[Buddhist art]], he is often depicted alongside the Buddha and Maudgaly\u0101yana, with \u015a\u0101riputra usually depicted on the Buddha's right hand side and Maudgaly\u0101yana usually depicted on the Buddha's left hand side.{{sfn|Silk|2019|p=410}} According to Nyanaponika Thera, this imagery symbolizes the relative positions they held in life, with \u015a\u0101riputra being the Buddha's right hand monk.{{sfn|Hecker|Nyanaponika Thera|2003|p=47}} In Burma, \u015a\u0101riputra is believed to grant wisdom to worshippers, and is one of eight arhats commonly shown devotion to in protective rituals.{{sfn|Buswell|2004|p=750}}\n\n\u015a\u0101riputra is notable for being representative of scholarship and settled monasticism, rather than the forest Buddhism that most of the Buddha's [[Ten Principal Disciples|principal disciples]] are associated with.{{sfn|Ray|1994|p=131-133}} Migot, however, identifies texts that exclude \u015a\u0101riputra's scholastic character as the earliest sources, Migot goes on to argue that the historic \u015a\u0101riputra was different than the person preserved in the Pali Canon.{{sfn|Ray|1994|p=131-133}}{{sfn|Findly|2003|p=398}} According to Ray it is possible \u015a\u0101riputra's scholastic character was the result of texts that were added later, but states there is insufficient evidence to conclude to this.{{sfn|Ray|1994|p=134-136}}\n==See also==\n* [[Maudgalyayana|Moggall\u0101na]]\n*[[Khema]]\n*[[Pa\u00f1\u00f1\u0101]]\n* ''[[Sammaditthi Sutta]]'' \u2013 a Pali Canon discourse attributed to S\u0101riputta\n* [[Sariputra in the Jatakas]]\n* [[Sanchi]]\n* [[Bhadda Kundalakesa]], a former Jain ascetic converted to Buddhism by S\u0101riputta\n\n== Notes ==\n<references group=\"note\" responsive=\"1\"></references>\n\n== Citations ==\n{{reflist|20em}}\n\n== References ==\n{{refbegin |30em}}\n* {{Citation|last=Brekke|first=Torkel|date=2007-01-01|title=Bones of Contention: Buddhist Relics, Nationalism and the Politics of Archaeology|url=https://brill.com/view/journals/nu/54/3/article-p270_2.xml|journal=Numen|language=en|volume=54|issue=3|pages=270\u2013303|doi=10.1163/156852707X211564|issn=1568-5276}}\n* {{Citation|last1=Berger |first1=Patricia Ann |title=Latter Days of the Law: Images of Chinese Buddhism, 850 - 1850 ; [exhibition, August 27 - October 9 1994 ...] |date=1994 |publisher=University of Hawaii Press |isbn=978-0-8248-1662-9 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Y6ffYIPn--wC&newbks=1&newbks_redir=0&source=gbs_navlinks_s |language=en}}\n* {{Citation|last1=Bodhi |first1=Bhikkhu |last2=Dhamma |first2=Rewata |title=A comprehensive manual of Abhidhamma : the Abhidhammattha sangaha of \u0100cariya Anuruddha |date=1993 |publisher=BPS Pariyatti Edition |isbn=978-1-928706-02-1 |edition=1st BPS Pariyatti}}\n* {{Citation|last1=Buswell|first1=Robert E.

He is considered the first of the Buddha's two chief disciples, together with [[Maudgaly\u0101yana ]] (Pali: ''Moggall\u0101na''). \u015a\u0101riputra had a key leadership role in the ministry of the Buddha and is considered in many Buddhist schools to have been important in the development of the Buddhist ''[[Abhidharma]]''. He appears in several [[Mahayana sutras]], and in some sutras, is used as a counterpoint to represent the [[Hinayana]] school of Buddhism.  \n\nBuddhist texts relate that \u015a\u0101riputra and Maudgaly\u0101yana were childhood friends who became spiritual wanderers in their youth. After having searched for spiritual truth for a while, they came into contact with the teachings of the Buddha and ordained as monks under him, after which the Buddha declared the friends his two chief disciples. \u015a\u0101riputra was said to have attained enlightenment as an [[arahant|arhat]] two weeks after ordaining. As chief disciple \u015a\u0101riputra assumed a leadership role in the [[Sangha]], doing tasks like looking after monks, giving them objects of meditation, and clarifying points of doctrine. He was the first disciple the Buddha allowed to ordain other monks. \u015a\u0101riputra died shortly before the Buddha in his hometown and was cremated. According to Buddhist texts, his relics were then enshrined at [[Jetavana]] Monastery.
