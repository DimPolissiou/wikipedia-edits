As well as being a practical fighting technique for use in actual warfare, muay became a sport in which the opponents fought in front of spectators who went to watch for entertainment. These muay contests gradually became an integral part of local festivals and celebrations, especially those held at temples. Eventually, the previously bare-fisted fighters started wearing lengths of hemp rope around their hands and forearms. This type of match was called muay ''khat chueak'' (\u0e21\u0e27\u0e22\u0e04\u0e32\u0e14\u0e40\u0e0a\u0e37\u0e2d\u0e01). Kickboxing was also a component of military training and gained prominence during the reign of King [[Naresuan the Great]] in 1560 CE.{{CN|date=March 2020}}\n\nMuay Thai is referred to as the \"art of eight limbs\" or the \"science of eight limbs\", because it makes use of punches, kicks, elbow and knee strikes, thus using eight \"points of contact\", as opposed to \"two points\" (fists) in boxing and \"four points\" (hands and feet) used in other more regulated combat sports, such as kickboxing and ''savate''.<ref name=\"thejakartapost1\"/> A practitioner of muay Thai is known as a ''nak muay''.

Muay progressed greatly during the reign of Rama V as a direct result of the king's personal interest in the sport. The country was at peace and muay functioned as a means of physical exercise, self-defense, attacking, recreation, and personal advancement.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}\n\n===Modernization===\n[[File:Thairoundkick.jpg|thumb|A Muay Thai fighter leans back to evade a round kick]]\n\n1909-1910: King Chulalongkorn formalizes Muay (Boran) by awarding (in 1910) three muen to victors at the funeral fights for his son (in 1909).

Thailand's first boxing ring was built in 1921 at Suan Kulap. Referees were introduced and rounds were now timed by kick. Fighters at the [[Lumpinee Boxing Stadium]] began wearing modern gloves, as well as hard groin protectors, during training and in boxing matches against foreigners. Traditional rope-binding (''khat chueak'') made the hands a hardened, dangerous striking tool. The use of knots in the rope over the knuckles made the strikes more abrasive and damaging for the opponent while protecting the hands of the fighter.<ref>{{cite web|last=Patterson|first=Jeff|title=Know Your Muay Thai: Hand Wraps|url=http://nwfighting.com/know-your-muay-thai-hand-wraps.html/|work=nwfighting.com|publisher=Northwest Fighting Arts|accessdate=4 March 2014}}</ref> This rope-binding was still used in fights between Thais but after the occurrence of a death in the ring, it was decided that fighters should wear gloves and cotton coverlets over the feet and ankles. It was also around this time that the term \"muay Thai\" became commonly used, while the older form of the style came to be known as \"muay boran\", which is now performed primarily as an exhibition art form.\n\nIn 1993, the [[International Federation of Muaythai Associations|International Federation of Muaythai Amateur]], or IFMA was inaugurated. It became the governing body of amateur muay Thai consisting of 128 member countries worldwide and is recognized by the [[Olympic Council of Asia]].\n\nIn 1995, the [[World Muaythai Council]], the oldest and largest professional sanctioning organizations of muay Thai, was established by the Thai government and sanctioned by the Sports Authority of Thailand.\n\nIn 1995, the World Muay Thai Federation was founded via the merger of two existing organizations, and established in [[Bangkok]] becoming the federation governing international muay Thai. As of August 2012, it had over 70 member countries. Its president is elected at the World Muay Thai Congress.\n\nIn 2006, muay Thai was included in [[SportAccord]] with IFMA. One of the requirements of SportAccord was that no sport can have a name of a country in its name. As a result, an amendment was made in the IFMA constitution to change the name of the sport from \"muay Thai\" to \"Muaythai\"\u2014written as one word in accordance with Olympic requirements.\n\nIn 2014 muay Thai was included in the [[International World Games Association]] (IWGA) and will be represented in the official programme of The World Games 2017 in [[Wroc\u0142aw]], Poland.\n\nIn January 2015, muay Thai was granted the patronage of the [[International University Sports Federation]] (FISU) and from 16 to 23 March 2015 the first University World Muaythai Cup was held in Bangkok.\n\n{{asof|2020}} there are more than 3,800 Thai boxing gyms overseas.<ref name=\"BP-20200330\">{{cite news |last1=Prateepchaikul |first1=Veera |title=Army's role in boxing a shady affair |url=https://www.bangkokpost.com/opinion/opinion/1889010/armys-role-in-boxing-a-shady-affair |accessdate=30 March 2020 |work=Bangkok Post |date=30 March 2020 |format=Opinion}}</ref>\n\n=== Thai fable ===\n{{More citations needed section|date=February 2020}}\nAccording to Thai folklore, at the time of the fall of the ancient Siamese capital of Ayutthaya Kingdom in 1767, the invading Burmese troops rounded up thousands of Siamese citizens. They then  organized a seven-day, seven-night religious festival in honor of Buddha's relics. The festivities included many forms of entertainment, such as the costume plays called ''likay'', comedies and farces, and sword fighting matches. At one point, [[Hsinbyushin|King Mangra]] wanted to see how Thai boxing would compare to their [[lethwei]]. Nai Khanomtom was selected to fight against the King\u2019s chosen champion and the boxing ring was set up in front of throne. Nai Khanomtom performed a traditional ''wai kru'' pre-fight dance, to pay his respects to his teachers and ancestors, dancing around his opponent. The perplexed Burmese thought it was black magic. When the fight began, Nai Khanomtom charged out, using punches, kicks, elbows, and knees to pummel his opponent until he collapsed. According to the story, the referee said the Burmese champion was too distracted by the dance, and declared the knockout invalid. The King supposedly asked if Nai Khanomtom would fight nine other Burmese champions to prove himself. He agreed and fought them all, one after the other with no rest periods. His last opponent was a great kickboxing teacher from [[Rakhine State]] who Nai Khanomtom defeated with kicks.\n\nKing Mangra was so impressed that he allegedly remarked that \"Every part of the Siamese is blessed with venom. Even with his bare hands, he can fell nine or ten opponents. But his Lord was incompetent and lost the country to the enemy. If he had been any good, there was no way the City of [[Ayutthaya Kingdom|Ayutthaya]] would ever have fallen.\"{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}} \n\nKing Mangra granted Nai Khanomtom freedom along with his choice of either riches or two beautiful Burmese wives. Nai Khanomtom chose the wives as he said that money was easier to find. He then departed with his wives for Siam. Variations of this story had him also win the release of his fellow Thai prisoners.\n\nThis tale is celebrated every 17 March as Boxer's Day or National Muay Boran Day in his honor.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wmcmuaythai.org/2012/02/20/spain-pays-respect-to-nai-kanom-tom|title=Spain Pays Respect to Nai Kanom Tom|date=2012-02-20 |accessdate=2013-05-11}}</ref>\n\nToday, some have wrongly attributed the legend of Nai Khanomtom to King Naresuan, who spent his youth as a royal hostage in Burma while Ayutthaya was a Burmese vassal. However, Nai Khanomtom and King Naresuan lived almost two centuries apart.\n\n==Techniques==\n[[File:Muay Thai match in Bangkok, Thailand.jpg|right|thumb|Muay Thai match, Bangkok]]\n\nFormal Muay Thai techniques are divided into two groups: ''mae mai'', or 'major techniques', and ''luk mai'', or 'minor techniques'. Muay Thai is often a fighting art of attrition, where opponents exchange blows with one another. This is certainly the case with traditional stylists in Thailand, but is a less popular form of fighting in the contemporary world fighting circuit where the Thai style of exchanging blow for blow is no longer favorable. Almost all techniques in muay Thai use the entire body movement, rotating the hip with each kick, punch, elbow and block.\n\n===Punching (''Chok'')===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!English !! Thai !!

Cross-fertilization with Western boxing and Western martial arts mean the full range of western boxing punches are now used: lead jab, straight/cross, hook, uppercut, shovel and corkscrew punches and overhands as well as hammer fists and back fists.\n\nAs a tactic, body punching is used less in muay Thai than most other striking combat sports to avoid exposing the attacker's head to counter strikes from knees or elbows. To utilize the range of targeting points, in keeping with the center line theory, the fighter can use either the Western or Thai stance which allows for either long range or short range attacks to be undertaken effectively without compromising guard.\n\n{{anchor|Elbow}}\n\n===Elbow (''Sok'')===\nThe elbow can be used in several ways as a striking weapon: horizontal, diagonal-upwards, diagonal-downwards, uppercut, downward, backward-spinning and flying. From the side, it can be used as either a finishing move or as a way to cut the opponent's eyebrow so that blood might block his vision. The diagonal elbows are faster than the other forms but are less powerful. The elbow strike is considered the most dangerous form of attack in the sport.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!English !!

The single elbow is a move independent from any other, whereas a follow-up elbow is the second strike from the same arm, being a hook or straight punch first with an elbow follow-up. Such elbows, and most other elbow strikes, are used when the distance between fighters becomes too small and there is too little space to throw a hook at the opponent's head.\n\nElbows can be used to great effect as blocks or defenses against, for example, spring knees, side body knees, body kicks or punches.

The Thai roundhouse kick uses a rotational movement of the entire body and has been widely adopted by practitioners of other combat sports. It is done from a circular stance with the back leg just a little ways back (roughly shoulder width apart) in comparison to instinctive upper body fighting (boxing) where the legs must create a wider base. The roundhouse kick draws its power almost entirely from the rotational movement of the hips, counter-rotation of the shoulders and arms are also often used to add torque to the lower body and increase the power of the kick as well.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Cimadoro |first1=Giuseppe |last2= Mahaffey |first2=Ryan |last3=Babault |first3=Nicolas |date= April 2018 |title=Acute neuromuscular responses to short and long roundhouse kick striking paces in professional Muay Thai fighters |journal=   The Journal of Sports Medicine and Physical Fitness|volume=59 |issue=2 |pages=204\u2013209 |doi= 10.23736/S0022-4707.18.08295-6 |pmid= 29619797 |url=https://research.stmarys.ac.uk/2208/1/Cimadoro-et-al-Acute-Neuromuscular-Responses-Short-Long-Roundhouse.pdf }}</ref>\n\nIf a roundhouse kick is attempted by the opponent, the Thai boxer will normally check the kick, that is, he will block the kick with the outside of his lower leg. Thai boxers are trained to always connect with the shin. The foot contains many fine bones and is much weaker. A fighter may end up hurting himself if he tries to strike with his foot or instep. Shins are trained by repeatedly striking firm objects, such as pads or heavy bags.\n{{anchor|Knee}}\n\n===Knee (''Ti Khao'')<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sprypublishing.com/ch7.pdf|title=Muay Thai Weapons|last=|first=|date=|website=|format=[[PDF]]|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202235209if_/http://sprypublishing.com/ch7.pdf|archive-date=2013-12-02|accessdate=2012-12-29}}</ref>===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!English !!

It is often in the clinch where knee and elbow techniques are used. To strike and bind the opponent for both offensive and defensive purposes, small amounts of [[Tachi waza|stand-up grappling]] are used in the [[clinch fighting|clinch]]. The front clinch should be performed with the palm of one hand on the back of the other. There are three reasons why the fingers must not be intertwined. 1) In the ring fighters are wearing boxing gloves and cannot intertwine their fingers. 2) The Thai front clinch involves pressing the head of the opponent downwards, which is easier if the hands are locked behind the back of the head instead of behind the neck. Furthermore, the arms should be putting as much pressure on the neck as possible. 3) A fighter may incur an injury to one or more fingers if they are intertwined, and it becomes more difficult to release the grip in order to quickly elbow the opponent's head.\n\nA correct clinch also involves the fighter's forearms pressing against the opponent's collar bone while the hands are around the opponent's head rather than the opponent's neck. The general way to get out of a clinch is to push the opponent's head backward or elbow them, as the clinch requires both participants to be very close to one another. Additionally, the non-dominant clincher can try to \"swim\" their arm underneath and inside the opponent's clinch, establishing the previously non-dominant clincher as the dominant clincher.\n\nMuay Thai has several other variants of the clinch or ''chap kho'' {{IPA-th|t\u0255\u00e0p k\u02b0\u0254\u02d0|}}, including:\n*arm clinch: One or both hands controls the inside of the defender's arm(s) and where the second hand if free is in the front clinch position. This clinch is used to briefly control the opponent before applying a knee strike or throw\n*side clinch: One arm passes around the front of the defender with the attacker's shoulder pressed into the defender's arm pit and the other arm passing round the back which allows the attacker to apply knee strikes to the defender's back or to throw the defender readily.\n*low clinch: Both controlling arms pass under the defender's arms, which is generally used by the shorter of two opponents.\n*swan-neck: One hand around the rear of the neck is used to briefly clinch an opponent before a strike.\n{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}\n\n===Defense against attacks===\n[[File:Muay Thai boxer.jpg|thumb|Praying before the match]]\nDefenses in Muay Thai are categorized in six groups:\n\n*Blocking \u2013 defender's hard blocks to stop a strike in its path so preventing it reaching its target (e.g. the shin block described in more detail below)\n*Parries \u2013 defender's soft parries to change the direction of a strike (e.g. a downwards tap to a jab) so that it misses the target\n*Avoidance \u2013 moving a body part out of the way or range of a strike so the defender remains in range for a counter-strike. For example, the defender moves their front leg backward to avoid the attacker's low kick, then immediately counters with a roundhouse kick. Or the defender might lay their head back from the attacker's high roundhouse kick then counter-attack with a side kick.\n*Evasion \u2013 moving the body out of the way or range of a strike so the defender has to move close again to counter-attack, e.g. defender jumping laterally or back from attacker's kicks\n*Disruption \u2013 Pre-empting an attack e.g. with defender using disruptive techniques like jab, foot-thrust or low roundhouse kick, generally called a \"leg kick\"(to the outside or inside of the attacker's front leg, just above the knee) as the attacker attempts to close distance\n*Anticipation \u2013 Defender catching a strike (e.g. catching a roundhouse kick to the body) or countering it before it lands (e.g. defender's low kick to the supporting leg below as the attacker initiates a high roundhouse kick).\n\n====Defenses in practice====\nDefensively, the concept of \"wall of defense\" is used, in which shoulders, arms and legs are used to hinder the attacker from successfully executing techniques. Blocking is a critical element in Muay Thai and compounds the level of conditioning a successful practitioner must possess. Low and mid body [[roundhouse kick]]s are normally blocked with the upper portion of a raised shin (this block is known as a 'check'). High body strikes are blocked ideally with the forearms and shoulder together, or if enough time is allowed for a parry, the glove (elusively), elbow, or shin will be used. Midsection [[roundhouse kick]]s can also be caught/trapped, allowing for a [[Leg trip|sweep]] or counter-attack to the remaining leg of the opponent. Punches are blocked with an ordinary boxing guard and techniques similar, if not identical, to basic boxing technique. A common means of blocking a punch is using the hand on the same side as the oncoming punch. For example, if an orthodox fighter throws a jab (being the left hand), the defender will make a slight tap to redirect the punch's angle with the right hand. The deflection is always as small and precise as possible to avoid unnecessary energy expenditure and return the hand to the guard as quickly as possible. Hooks are often blocked with a motion sometimes described as \"combing the hair\", that is, raising the elbow forward and effectively shielding the head with the forearm, flexed biceps and shoulder. More advanced Muay Thai blocks are usually in the form of counter-strikes, using the opponent's weight (as they strike) to amplify the damage that the countering opponent can deliver. This requires impeccable timing and thus can generally only be learned by many repetitions.\n\n==Conditioning==\n[[File:Punching bag.jpg|right|thumb|A fighter punching a heavy bag at a training camp in Thailand]]\n\nLike most full contact fighting sports, Muay Thai has a heavy focus on body [[Physical exercise|conditioning]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fightland.vice.com/blog/muay-thai-economic-realities-and-cultural-differences|title=Muay Thai, Economic Realities, and Cultural Differences|last=Gordon|first=Mclean|date=2013-05-22|website=Fightland|publisher=Vice|accessdate=2015-03-04}}</ref> Muay Thai is specifically designed to promote the level of [[physical fitness|fitness]] and toughness required for ring competition. Training regimens include many staples of combat sport conditioning such as [[running]], [[shadowboxing]], [[skipping rope|rope jumping]], [[calisthenics|body weight resistance exercises]], medicine ball exercises, [[abdominal exercise]]s, and in some cases [[weight training]]. Thai boxers rely heavily on kicks utilizing the shin bone. As such, practitioners of Muay Thai will repeatedly hit a dense heavy bag with their shins, conditioning it, hardening the bone through a process called [[bone remodeling|cortical remodeling]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Baker |first=Donnie |url=http://oldstylemuaythai.blogspot.co.uk/2012/10/top-3-muay-thai-shin-conditioning-myths.html |title=Muay Thai: Beyond The Ring: Top 3 Muay Thai Shin Conditioning Myths Debunked |website=Oldstylemuaythai.blogspot.co.uk |date=2012-10-28 |accessdate=2015-03-04}}</ref> Striking a sand-filled bag will have the same effect.\n\n[[File:Muay Thai Championship Boxing - Anthony Cordero.jpg|left|thumb|A fighter before a round]]\n\nTraining specific to a Thai fighter includes training with coaches on Thai pads, [[focus mitt]]s, heavy bag, and sparring. Daily training includes many rounds (3\u20135 minute periods broken up by a short rest, often 1\u20132 minutes) of these various methods of practice. Thai pad training is a cornerstone of Muay Thai conditioning that involves practicing punches, kicks, knees, and elbow strikes with a trainer wearing thick pads covering the forearms and hands. These special pads (often referred to as Thai pads) are used to absorb the impact of the fighter's strikes and allow the fighter to react to the attacks of the pad holder in a live situation. The trainer will often also wear a belly pad around the abdominal area so that the fighter can attack with straight kicks or knees to the body at any time during the round.\n\nFocus mitts are specific to training a fighter's hand speed, [[punch combinations]], timing, [[punching power]], defense, and counter-punching and may also be used to practice elbow strikes. Heavy bag training is a conditioning and power exercise that reinforces the techniques practiced on the pads. Sparring is a means to test technique, skills, range, strategy, and timing against a partner. Sparring is often a light to medium contact exercise because competitive fighters on a full schedule are not advised to risk injury by sparring hard. Specific tactics and strategies can be trained with sparring including in close fighting, [[Clinching position|clinching]] and kneeing only, cutting off the ring, or using reach and distance to keep an aggressive fighter away.\n\nDue to the rigorous training regimen (some Thai boxers fight almost every other week) professional boxers in Thailand have relatively short careers in the ring. Many retire from competition to begin instructing the next generation of Thai fighters. Most professional Thai boxers come from lower economic backgrounds, and the purse (after other parties get their cut) is sought as means of support for the fighters and their families.<ref>{{cite web|last=Newhall |first=Lindsey |url=http://fightland.vice.com/blog/an-american-sociologist-is-studying-the-behavior-of-muay-thai |title=An American Sociologist Is Studying the Behavior of Muay Thai|publisher=Vice|website=Fightland|date=2015-01-16 |accessdate=2015-03-04}}</ref> Very few higher economic strata Thais join the professional Muay Thai ranks; they usually either do not practice the sport or practice it only as amateur Muay Thai boxers.<ref>{{cite web|last=Newhall |first=Lindsey |url=http://fightland.vice.com/blog/the-world-muay-thai-angels-marketing-the-women-fighters-of-thailand |title=The World Muay Thai Angels: Marketing the Women Fighters of Thailand|publisher=Vice|website=Fightland|date=2015-02-13 |accessdate=2015-03-04}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Newhall |first=Lindsey |url=http://fightland.vice.com/blog/an-american-in-thailand-muay-thai-for-the-rich |title=An American in Thailand: Muay Thai for the Rich|publisher=Vice|website=Fightland|date=2014-09-04 |accessdate=2015-03-04}}</ref>\n\n==Traditional wear==\n[[File:Wat Thai Village DC 2013 (9343057612).jpg|thumb|The [[mongkhon]] (headband) and [[pra jiad]] (armbands) are often worn into the ring before the match begins]]\nThe [[mongkhon]], or mongkol (headband) and [[pra jiad]] (armbands) are often worn into the ring before the match begins. They originate back in times when Thailand was in a constant state of war, where young men would tear off pieces of a loved one's clothing (often their mother's sarong) and wear it in battle for good luck as well as to ward off harmful spirits. In modern times the mongkol (lit. 'holy spirit, luck, and protection') is worn as a tribute to the fighter's gym. The mongkol is traditionally presented by a trainer to the fighter once he feels that the fighter is ready to represent the gym in the ring. Often after the fighter has finished the ''[[Wai khru ram muay|wai kru]]'', the trainer will take the mongkol off of his head and place it in his corner of the ring for luck. They were also used for protection. Whether the fighter is a Buddhist or not, it is common for them to bring the mongkol to a Buddhist monk who blesses it with good luck prior to stepping into the ring.\n\n==Child boxers==\nIn 2016, 9,998 children under the age of 15 were registered with Board of Boxing under the Sport Authority of Thailand, according to the Child Safety Promotion and Injury Prevention Research Centre (CSIP).<ref name=BP-20161226>{{cite news|url=http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/general/1168505/expert-urges-no-head-contact-among-young-boxers|title=Expert urges 'no head contact' among young boxers|work=Bangkok Post|first=Prangthong|last=Jitcharoenkul|date=2016-12-26|accessdate=2018-10-27}}</ref> Four hundred twenty young boxers registered with the board annually, between 2007 and 2015.<ref name=BP-20161226/> Some estimates put the number of child boxers nationwide at between 200,000 and 300,000, some as young as four years old.<ref name=BP-20171222>{{cite news|title=Doctors call for crackdown on child boxing|url=https://www.bangkokpost.com/news/general/1383386/doctors-call-for-crackdown-on-child-boxing|accessdate=22 December 2017|work=Bangkok Post|date=22 December 2017}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Thai Boxer.jpg|thumb|left|Child boxer]]\n\nThe Advanced Diagnostic Imaging Centre (AIMC) at [[Ramathibodi Hospital]] studied 300 child boxers aged under 15 with two to more than five years of experience, as well as 200 children who do not box.

An injury is considered reportable if it requires the athlete to rest for more than one day. Many injuries in the sport of Muay Thai go unreported as the fighters may not notice the injuries at first, refusing to admit they need treatment, a heightened pain threshold, fear that their instructor will perceive the injury negatively, and confusion as to what is an injury.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Gartland|first=Malik|date=|title=Injury and injury rates in Muay Thai kick boxing|url=|journal=Gale Group|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref> Similar to most sports, injury rates tend to be higher in beginners rather than amateurs and professionals. [[Soft tissue injury|Soft tissue injuries]] are the most common form of injury in Muay Thai, contributing between 80\u201390% of all injuries. These injuries are caused by repeated trauma to soft parts of the body. During matches there is little to no padding and that leaves soft tissue vulnerable to strikes. The second most common injury among beginner and amateur Muay Thai fighters are [[sprain]]s and [[Strain (injury)|strains]]. It appears that these injuries can be easily avoided or reduced. Many participants of a study admitted to inadequate warm up before the event of the injury.<ref name=\":0\" /> The third most common injury are fractures. Fractures are more commonly seen with amateur and professional fighters, because they are allowed full contact and beginners are allowed no contact. The most common sites for fractures are the nose, [[carpal bones]], [[Metacarpal bones|metacarpals]], [[Digit (anatomy)|digits]], and [[Rib cage|ribs]]. The distribution of injuries are significantly different between the three groups (beginner, amateur, and professional), this seems to be expected as a person progresses through the different levels the forces involved are a lot higher, less padding and protective equipment is used, and athletes are likely to train harder, resulting in more serious injuries among experienced fighters.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Thailand|Society|Martial arts}}\n*[[Yaw-Yan]], in the Philippines\n*[[Musti-yuddha]], in India\n*[[Lethwei]], in Myanmar\n*[[Muay Lao]], in Laos\n*[[Pradal serey]], in Cambodia\n*[[Tomoi]], in Malaysia\n*[[Muay Thai in popular culture]]\n*[[Rajadamnern Stadium]]\n*[[Lumpinee Boxing Stadium]]\n*[[International Federation of Muaythai Associations]]\n*[[World Muaythai Federation]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{Commons+cat|Muay Thai}}\n*{{Citation|surname=Kraitus|given=Panya|year=1992|title=Muay Thai The Most Distinguished Art of Fighting |publisher=Transit Press|place=Phuket|isbn=974-86841-9-9|ref=none}}\n* ''Muay Thai The Essential Guide To The Art of Thai Boxing''.

As well as being a practical fighting technique for use in actual warfare, muay became a sport in which the opponents fought in front of spectators who went to watch for entertainment. These muay contests gradually became an integral part of local festivals and celebrations, especially those held at temples. Eventually, the previously bare-fisted fighters started wearing lengths of hemp rope around their hands and forearms. This type of match was called muay ''khat chueak'' (\u0e21\u0e27\u0e22\u0e04\u0e32\u0e14\u0e40\u0e0a\u0e37\u0e2d\u0e01). Kickboxing was also a component of military training and gained prominence during the reign of King [[Naresuan the Great]] in 1560 CE.{{CN|date=March 2020}}\n\nMuay Thai is referred to as the \"art of eight limbs\" or the \"science of eight limbs\", because it makes use of punches, kicks, elbow and knee strikes, thus using eight \"points of contact\", as opposed to \"two points\" (fists) in boxing and \"four points\" (hands and feet) used in other more regulated combat sports, such as kickboxing and ''savate''.<ref name=\"thejakartapost1\"/> A practitioner of muay Thai is known as a ''nak muay''.

Muay progressed greatly during the reign of Rama V as a direct result of the king's personal interest in the sport.

Thailand's first boxing ring was built in 1921 at Suan Kulap. Referees were introduced and rounds were now timed by kick. Fighters at the [[Lumpinee Boxing Stadium]] began wearing modern gloves, as well as hard groin protectors, during training and in boxing matches against foreigners. Traditional rope-binding (''khat chueak'') made the hands a hardened, dangerous striking tool. The use of knots in the rope over the knuckles made the strikes more abrasive and damaging for the opponent while protecting the hands of the fighter.<ref>{{cite web|last=Patterson|first=Jeff|title=Know Your Muay Thai: Hand Wraps|url=http://nwfighting.com/know-your-muay-thai-hand-wraps.html/|work=nwfighting.com|publisher=Northwest Fighting Arts|accessdate=4 March 2014}}</ref> This rope-binding was still used in fights between Thais but after the occurrence of a death in the ring, it was decided that fighters should wear gloves and cotton coverlets over the feet and ankles. It was also around this time that the term \"muay Thai\" became commonly used, while the older form of the style came to be known as \"muay boran\", which is now performed primarily as an exhibition art form.\n\nIn 1993, the [[International Federation of Muaythai Associations|International Federation of Muaythai Amateur]], or IFMA was inaugurated. It became the governing body of amateur muay Thai consisting of 128 member countries worldwide and is recognized by the [[Olympic Council of Asia]].\n\nIn 1995, the [[World Muaythai Council]], the oldest and largest professional sanctioning organizations of muay Thai, was established by the Thai government and sanctioned by the Sports Authority of Thailand.\n\nIn 1995, the World Muay Thai Federation was founded via the merger of two existing organizations, and established in [[Bangkok]] becoming the federation governing international muay Thai. As of August 2012, it had over 70 member countries. Its president is elected at the World Muay Thai Congress.\n\nIn 2006, muay Thai was included in [[SportAccord]] with IFMA. One of the requirements of SportAccord was that no sport can have a name of a country in its name. As a result, an amendment was made in the IFMA constitution to change the name of the sport from \"muay Thai\" to \"Muaythai\"\u2014written as one word in accordance with Olympic requirements.\n\nIn 2014 muay Thai was included in the [[International World Games Association]] (IWGA) and will be represented in the official programme of The World Games 2017 in [[Wroc\u0142aw]], Poland.\n\nIn January 2015, muay Thai was granted the patronage of the [[International University Sports Federation]] (FISU) and from 16 to 23 March 2015 the first University World Muaythai Cup was held in Bangkok.\n\n{{asof|2020}} there are more than 3,800 Thai boxing gyms overseas.<ref name=\"BP-20200330\">{{cite news |last1=Prateepchaikul |first1=Veera |title=Army's role in boxing a shady affair |url=https://www.bangkokpost.com/opinion/opinion/1889010/armys-role-in-boxing-a-shady-affair |accessdate=30 March 2020 |work=Bangkok Post |date=30 March 2020 |format=Opinion}}</ref>\n\n=== Thai fable ===\n{{More citations needed section|date=February 2020}}\nAccording to Thai folklore, at the time of the fall of the ancient Siamese capital of Ayutthaya Kingdom in 1767, the invading Burmese troops rounded up thousands of Siamese citizens. They then  organized a seven-day, seven-night religious festival in honor of Buddha's relics. The festivities included many forms of entertainment, such as the costume plays called ''likay'', comedies and farces, and sword fighting matches. At one point, [[Hsinbyushin|King Mangra]] wanted to see how Thai boxing would compare to their [[lethwei]]. Nai Khanomtom was selected to fight against the King\u2019s chosen champion and the boxing ring was set up in front of throne. Nai Khanomtom performed a traditional ''wai kru'' pre-fight dance, to pay his respects to his teachers and ancestors, dancing around his opponent. The perplexed Burmese thought it was black magic. When the fight began, Nai Khanomtom charged out, using punches, kicks, elbows, and knees to pummel his opponent until he collapsed. According to the story, the referee said the Burmese champion was too distracted by the dance, and declared the knockout invalid. The King supposedly asked if Nai Khanomtom would fight nine other Burmese champions to prove himself. He agreed and fought them all, one after the other with no rest periods. His last opponent was a great kickboxing teacher from [[Rakhine State]] who Nai Khanomtom defeated with kicks.\n\nKing Mangra was so impressed that he allegedly remarked that \"Every part of the Siamese is blessed with venom. Even with his bare hands, he can fell nine or ten opponents. But his Lord was incompetent and lost the country to the enemy. If he had been any good, there was no way the City of [[Ayutthaya Kingdom|Ayutthaya]] would ever have fallen.\"{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}} \n\nKing Mangra granted Nai Khanomtom freedom along with his choice of either riches or two beautiful Burmese wives. Nai Khanomtom chose the wives as he said that money was easier to find. He then departed with his wives for Siam. Variations of this story had him also win the release of his fellow Thai prisoners.\n\nThis tale is celebrated every 17 March as Boxer's Day or National Muay Boran Day in his honor.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wmcmuaythai.org/2012/02/20/spain-pays-respect-to-nai-kanom-tom|title=Spain Pays Respect to Nai Kanom Tom|date=2012-02-20 |accessdate=2013-05-11}}</ref>\n\nToday, some have wrongly attributed the legend of Nai Khanomtom to King Naresuan, who spent his youth as a royal hostage in Burma while Ayutthaya was a Burmese vassal. However, Nai Khanomtom and King Naresuan lived almost two centuries apart.\n\n==Techniques==\n[[File:Muay Thai match in Bangkok, Thailand.jpg|right|thumb|Muay Thai match, Bangkok]]\n\nFormal Muay Thai techniques are divided into two groups: ''mae mai'', or 'major techniques', and ''luk mai'', or 'minor techniques'. Muay Thai is often a fighting art of attrition, where opponents exchange blows with one another. This is certainly the case with traditional stylists in Thailand, but is a less popular form of fighting in the contemporary world fighting circuit where the Thai style of exchanging blow for blow is no longer favorable. Almost all techniques in muay Thai use the entire body movement, rotating the hip with each kick, punch, elbow and block.\n\n===Punching (''Chok'')===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!English !! Thai !!

Cross-fertilization with Western boxing and Western martial arts mean the full range of western boxing punches are now used: lead jab, straight/cross, hook, uppercut, shovel and corkscrew punches and overhands as well as hammer fists and back fists.\n\nAs a tactic, body punching is used less in muay Thai than most other striking combat sports to avoid exposing the attacker's head to counter strikes from knees or elbows. To utilize the range of targeting points, in keeping with the center line theory, the fighter can use either the Western or Thai stance which allows for either long range or short range attacks to be undertaken effectively without compromising guard.\n\n{{anchor|Elbow}}\n\n===Elbow (''Sok'')===\nThe elbow can be used in several ways as a striking weapon: horizontal, diagonal-upwards, diagonal-downwards, uppercut, downward, backward-spinning and flying. From the side, it can be used as either a finishing move or as a way to cut the opponent's eyebrow so that blood might block his vision.

The single elbow is a move independent from any other, whereas a follow-up elbow is the second strike from the same arm, being a hook or straight punch first with an elbow follow-up. Such elbows, and most other elbow strikes, are used when the distance between fighters becomes too small and there is too little space to throw a hook at the opponent's head.\n\nElbows can be used to great effect as blocks or defenses against, for example, spring knees, side body knees, body kicks or punches. When well connected, an elbow strike can cause serious damage to the opponent, including cuts or even a knockout.\n\n===Kicking (''Te'')===\n[[File:Womens Muay Thai.jpg|right|thumb|Muay Thai boxer delivering a kick]]\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!English !!

The Thai roundhouse kick uses a rotational movement of the entire body and has been widely adopted by practitioners of other combat sports. It is done from a circular stance with the back leg just a little ways back (roughly shoulder width apart) in comparison to instinctive upper body fighting (boxing) where the legs must create a wider base. The roundhouse kick draws its power almost entirely from the rotational movement of the hips, counter-rotation of the shoulders and arms are also often used to add torque to the lower body and increase the power of the kick as well.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Cimadoro |first1=Giuseppe |last2= Mahaffey |first2=Ryan |last3=Babault |first3=Nicolas |date= April 2018 |title=Acute neuromuscular responses to short and long roundhouse kick striking paces in professional Muay Thai fighters |journal=   The Journal of Sports Medicine and Physical Fitness|volume=59 |issue=2 |pages=204\u2013209 |doi= 10.23736/S0022-4707.18.08295-6 |pmid= 29619797 |url=https://research.stmarys.ac.uk/2208/1/Cimadoro-et-al-Acute-Neuromuscular-Responses-Short-Long-Roundhouse.pdf }}</ref>\n\nIf a roundhouse kick is attempted by the opponent, the Thai boxer will normally check the kick, that is, he will block the kick with the outside of his lower leg. Thai boxers are trained to always connect with the shin. The foot contains many fine bones and is much weaker. A fighter may end up hurting himself if he tries to strike with his foot or instep. Shins are trained by repeatedly striking firm objects, such as pads or heavy bags.\n{{anchor|Knee}}\n\n===Knee (''Ti Khao'')<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sprypublishing.com/ch7.pdf|title=Muay Thai Weapons|last=|first=|date=|website=|format=[[PDF]]|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202235209if_/http://sprypublishing.com/ch7.pdf|archive-date=2013-12-02|accessdate=2012-12-29}}</ref>===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!English !!

It is often in the clinch where knee and elbow techniques are used. To strike and bind the opponent for both offensive and defensive purposes, small amounts of [[Tachi waza|stand-up grappling]] are used in the [[clinch fighting|clinch]]. The front clinch should be performed with the palm of one hand on the back of the other. There are three reasons why the fingers must not be intertwined. 1) In the ring fighters are wearing boxing gloves and cannot intertwine their fingers. 2) The Thai front clinch involves pressing the head of the opponent downwards, which is easier if the hands are locked behind the back of the head instead of behind the neck. Furthermore, the arms should be putting as much pressure on the neck as possible. 3) A fighter may incur an injury to one or more fingers if they are intertwined, and it becomes more difficult to release the grip in order to quickly elbow the opponent's head.\n\nA correct clinch also involves the fighter's forearms pressing against the opponent's collar bone while the hands are around the opponent's head rather than the opponent's neck. The general way to get out of a clinch is to push the opponent's head backward or elbow them, as the clinch requires both participants to be very close to one another. Additionally, the non-dominant clincher can try to \"swim\" their arm underneath and inside the opponent's clinch, establishing the previously non-dominant clincher as the dominant clincher.\n\nMuay Thai has several other variants of the clinch or ''chap kho'' {{IPA-th|t\u0255\u00e0p k\u02b0\u0254\u02d0|}}, including:\n*arm clinch: One or both hands controls the inside of the defender's arm(s) and where the second hand if free is in the front clinch position. This clinch is used to briefly control the opponent before applying a knee strike or throw\n*side clinch: One arm passes around the front of the defender with the attacker's shoulder pressed into the defender's arm pit and the other arm passing round the back which allows the attacker to apply knee strikes to the defender's back or to throw the defender readily.\n*low clinch: Both controlling arms pass under the defender's arms, which is generally used by the shorter of two opponents.\n*swan-neck: One hand around the rear of the neck is used to briefly clinch an opponent before a strike.\n{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}\n\n===Defense against attacks===\n[[File:Muay Thai boxer.jpg|thumb|Praying before the match]]\nDefenses in Muay Thai are categorized in six groups:\n\n*Blocking \u2013 defender's hard blocks to stop a strike in its path so preventing it reaching its target (e.g. the shin block described in more detail below)\n*Parries \u2013 defender's soft parries to change the direction of a strike (e.g. a downwards tap to a jab) so that it misses the target\n*Avoidance \u2013 moving a body part out of the way or range of a strike so the defender remains in range for a counter-strike. For example, the defender moves their front leg backward to avoid the attacker's low kick, then immediately counters with a roundhouse kick. Or the defender might lay their head back from the attacker's high roundhouse kick then counter-attack with a side kick.\n*Evasion \u2013 moving the body out of the way or range of a strike so the defender has to move close again to counter-attack, e.g. defender jumping laterally or back from attacker's kicks\n*Disruption \u2013 Pre-empting an attack e.g. with defender using disruptive techniques like jab, foot-thrust or low roundhouse kick, generally called a \"leg kick\"(to the outside or inside of the attacker's front leg, just above the knee) as the attacker attempts to close distance\n*Anticipation \u2013 Defender catching a strike (e.g. catching a roundhouse kick to the body) or countering it before it lands (e.g. defender's low kick to the supporting leg below as the attacker initiates a high roundhouse kick).\n\n====Defenses in practice====\nDefensively, the concept of \"wall of defense\" is used, in which shoulders, arms and legs are used to hinder the attacker from successfully executing techniques. Blocking is a critical element in Muay Thai and compounds the level of conditioning a successful practitioner must possess. Low and mid body [[roundhouse kick]]s are normally blocked with the upper portion of a raised shin (this block is known as a 'check'). High body strikes are blocked ideally with the forearms and shoulder together, or if enough time is allowed for a parry, the glove (elusively), elbow, or shin will be used. Midsection [[roundhouse kick]]s can also be caught/trapped, allowing for a [[Leg trip|sweep]] or counter-attack to the remaining leg of the opponent. Punches are blocked with an ordinary boxing guard and techniques similar, if not identical, to basic boxing technique. A common means of blocking a punch is using the hand on the same side as the oncoming punch. For example, if an orthodox fighter throws a jab (being the left hand), the defender will make a slight tap to redirect the punch's angle with the right hand. The deflection is always as small and precise as possible to avoid unnecessary energy expenditure and return the hand to the guard as quickly as possible. Hooks are often blocked with a motion sometimes described as \"combing the hair\", that is, raising the elbow forward and effectively shielding the head with the forearm, flexed biceps and shoulder. More advanced Muay Thai blocks are usually in the form of counter-strikes, using the opponent's weight (as they strike) to amplify the damage that the countering opponent can deliver. This requires impeccable timing and thus can generally only be learned by many repetitions.\n\n==Conditioning==\n[[File:Punching bag.jpg|right|thumb|A fighter punching a heavy bag at a training camp in Thailand]]\n\nLike most full contact fighting sports, Muay Thai has a heavy focus on body [[Physical exercise|conditioning]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fightland.vice.com/blog/muay-thai-economic-realities-and-cultural-differences|title=Muay Thai, Economic Realities, and Cultural Differences|last=Gordon|first=Mclean|date=2013-05-22|website=Fightland|publisher=Vice|accessdate=2015-03-04}}</ref> Muay Thai is specifically designed to promote the level of [[physical fitness|fitness]] and toughness required for ring competition. Training regimens include many staples of combat sport conditioning such as [[running]], [[shadowboxing]], [[skipping rope|rope jumping]], [[calisthenics|body weight resistance exercises]], medicine ball exercises, [[abdominal exercise]]s, and in some cases [[weight training]]. Thai boxers rely heavily on kicks utilizing the shin bone. As such, practitioners of Muay Thai will repeatedly hit a dense heavy bag with their shins, conditioning it, hardening the bone through a process called [[bone remodeling|cortical remodeling]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Baker |first=Donnie |url=http://oldstylemuaythai.blogspot.co.uk/2012/10/top-3-muay-thai-shin-conditioning-myths.html |title=Muay Thai: Beyond The Ring: Top 3 Muay Thai Shin Conditioning Myths Debunked |website=Oldstylemuaythai.blogspot.co.uk |date=2012-10-28 |accessdate=2015-03-04}}</ref> Striking a sand-filled bag will have the same effect.\n\n[[File:Muay Thai Championship Boxing - Anthony Cordero.jpg|left|thumb|A fighter before a round]]\n\nTraining specific to a Thai fighter includes training with coaches on Thai pads, [[focus mitt]]s, heavy bag, and sparring. Daily training includes many rounds (3\u20135 minute periods broken up by a short rest, often 1\u20132 minutes) of these various methods of practice. Thai pad training is a cornerstone of Muay Thai conditioning that involves practicing punches, kicks, knees, and elbow strikes with a trainer wearing thick pads covering the forearms and hands. These special pads (often referred to as Thai pads) are used to absorb the impact of the fighter's strikes and allow the fighter to react to the attacks of the pad holder in a live situation. The trainer will often also wear a belly pad around the abdominal area so that the fighter can attack with straight kicks or knees to the body at any time during the round.\n\nFocus mitts are specific to training a fighter's hand speed, [[punch combinations]], timing, [[punching power]], defense, and counter-punching and may also be used to practice elbow strikes. Heavy bag training is a conditioning and power exercise that reinforces the techniques practiced on the pads. Sparring is a means to test technique, skills, range, strategy, and timing against a partner. Sparring is often a light to medium contact exercise because competitive fighters on a full schedule are not advised to risk injury by sparring hard. Specific tactics and strategies can be trained with sparring including in close fighting, [[Clinching position|clinching]] and kneeing only, cutting off the ring, or using reach and distance to keep an aggressive fighter away.\n\nDue to the rigorous training regimen (some Thai boxers fight almost every other week) professional boxers in Thailand have relatively short careers in the ring. Many retire from competition to begin instructing the next generation of Thai fighters. Most professional Thai boxers come from lower economic backgrounds, and the purse (after other parties get their cut) is sought as means of support for the fighters and their families.<ref>{{cite web|last=Newhall |first=Lindsey |url=http://fightland.vice.com/blog/an-american-sociologist-is-studying-the-behavior-of-muay-thai |title=An American Sociologist Is Studying the Behavior of Muay Thai|publisher=Vice|website=Fightland|date=2015-01-16 |accessdate=2015-03-04}}</ref> Very few higher economic strata Thais join the professional Muay Thai ranks; they usually either do not practice the sport or practice it only as amateur Muay Thai boxers.<ref>{{cite web|last=Newhall |first=Lindsey |url=http://fightland.vice.com/blog/the-world-muay-thai-angels-marketing-the-women-fighters-of-thailand |title=The World Muay Thai Angels: Marketing the Women Fighters of Thailand|publisher=Vice|website=Fightland|date=2015-02-13 |accessdate=2015-03-04}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Newhall |first=Lindsey |url=http://fightland.vice.com/blog/an-american-in-thailand-muay-thai-for-the-rich |title=An American in Thailand: Muay Thai for the Rich|publisher=Vice|website=Fightland|date=2014-09-04 |accessdate=2015-03-04}}</ref>\n\n==Traditional wear==\n[[File:Wat Thai Village DC 2013 (9343057612).jpg|thumb|The [[mongkhon]] (headband) and [[pra jiad]] (armbands) are often worn into the ring before the match begins]]\nThe [[mongkhon]], or mongkol (headband) and [[pra jiad]] (armbands) are often worn into the ring before the match begins. They originate back in times when Thailand was in a constant state of war, where young men would tear off pieces of a loved one's clothing (often their mother's sarong) and wear it in battle for good luck as well as to ward off harmful spirits. In modern times the mongkol (lit. 'holy spirit, luck, and protection') is worn as a tribute to the fighter's gym. The mongkol is traditionally presented by a trainer to the fighter once he feels that the fighter is ready to represent the gym in the ring. Often after the fighter has finished the ''[[Wai khru ram muay|wai kru]]'', the trainer will take the mongkol off of his head and place it in his corner of the ring for luck. They were also used for protection. Whether the fighter is a Buddhist or not, it is common for them to bring the mongkol to a Buddhist monk who blesses it with good luck prior to stepping into the ring.\n\n==Child boxers==\nIn 2016, 9,998 children under the age of 15 were registered with Board of Boxing under the Sport Authority of Thailand, according to the Child Safety Promotion and Injury Prevention Research Centre (CSIP).<ref name=BP-20161226>{{cite news|url=http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/general/1168505/expert-urges-no-head-contact-among-young-boxers|title=Expert urges 'no head contact' among young boxers|work=Bangkok Post|first=Prangthong|last=Jitcharoenkul|date=2016-12-26|accessdate=2018-10-27}}</ref> Four hundred twenty young boxers registered with the board annually, between 2007 and 2015.<ref name=BP-20161226/> Some estimates put the number of child boxers nationwide at between 200,000 and 300,000, some as young as four years old.<ref name=BP-20171222>{{cite news|title=Doctors call for crackdown on child boxing|url=https://www.bangkokpost.com/news/general/1383386/doctors-call-for-crackdown-on-child-boxing|accessdate=22 December 2017|work=Bangkok Post|date=22 December 2017}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Thai Boxer.jpg|thumb|left|Child boxer]]\n\nThe Advanced Diagnostic Imaging Centre (AIMC) at [[Ramathibodi Hospital]] studied 300 child boxers aged under 15 with two to more than five years of experience, as well as 200 children who do not box.

An injury is considered reportable if it requires the athlete to rest for more than one day. Many injuries in the sport of Muay Thai go unreported as the fighters may not notice the injuries at first, refusing to admit they need treatment, a heightened pain threshold, fear that their instructor will perceive the injury negatively, and confusion as to what is an injury.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Gartland|first=Malik|date=|title=Injury and injury rates in Muay Thai kick boxing|url=|journal=Gale Group|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref> Similar to most sports, injury rates tend to be higher in beginners rather than amateurs and professionals. [[Soft tissue injury|Soft tissue injuries]] are the most common form of injury in Muay Thai, contributing between 80\u201390% of all injuries. These injuries are caused by repeated trauma to soft parts of the body. During matches there is little to no padding and that leaves soft tissue vulnerable to strikes. The second most common injury among beginner and amateur Muay Thai fighters are [[sprain]]s and [[Strain (injury)|strains]]. It appears that these injuries can be easily avoided or reduced. Many participants of a study admitted to inadequate warm up before the event of the injury.<ref name=\":0\" /> The third most common injury are fractures. Fractures are more commonly seen with amateur and professional fighters, because they are allowed full contact and beginners are allowed no contact. The most common sites for fractures are the nose, [[carpal bones]], [[Metacarpal bones|metacarpals]], [[Digit (anatomy)|digits]], and [[Rib cage|ribs]]. The distribution of injuries are significantly different between the three groups (beginner, amateur, and professional), this seems to be expected as a person progresses through the different levels the forces involved are a lot higher, less padding and protective equipment is used, and athletes are likely to train harder, resulting in more serious injuries among experienced fighters.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Thailand|Society|Martial arts}}\n*[[Yaw-Yan]], in the Philippines\n*[[Musti-yuddha]], in India\n*[[Lethwei]], in Myanmar\n*[[Muay Lao]], in Laos\n*[[Pradal serey]], in Cambodia\n*[[Tomoi]], in Malaysia\n*[[Muay Thai in popular culture]]\n*[[Rajadamnern Stadium]]\n*[[Lumpinee Boxing Stadium]]\n*[[International Federation of Muaythai Associations]]\n*[[World Muaythai Federation]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{Commons+cat|Muay Thai}}\n*{{Citation|surname=Kraitus|given=Panya|year=1992|title=Muay Thai The Most Distinguished Art of Fighting |publisher=Transit Press|place=Phuket|isbn=974-86841-9-9|ref=none}}\n* ''Muay Thai The Essential Guide To The Art of Thai Boxing''.
