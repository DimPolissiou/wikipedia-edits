{"title_page": "Analytics in higher education", "text_new": "{{Multiple issues|\n{{Underlinked|date=November 2019}}\n{{original research|date=October 2016}}\n{{no footnotes|date=March 2020}}\n}}\n\n'''Academic analytics''' is defined as the process of evaluating and analysing organisational data received from [[university]] systems for reporting and decision making reasons (Campbell, & Oblinger, 2007)[https://er.educause.edu/articles/2007/7/academic-analytics-a-new-tool-for-a-new-era]. According to Campbell & Oblinger (2007), accrediting agencies, [[Government|governments]], [[Parent|parents]] and [[Student|students]] are all calling for the adoption of new modern and efficient ways of improving and monitoring student success. This has ushered the higher education system into an era characterized by increased scrutiny from the various [[Stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholders]]. For instance, the Bradley review acknowledges that [[benchmarking]] activities such as student engagement serve as indicators for gauging the institution's quality (Commonwealth [[Government of Australia]], 2008).\n\nIncreased competition, [[accreditation]], assessment and regulation are the major factors encouraging the adoption of analytics in [[higher education]]. Although institutions of higher learning gather a lot of vital data that can significantly aid in solving problems like attrition and retention, the collected data is not being analysed adequately and hence translated into useful data (Goldstein, 2005.) Subsequently, higher education leadership are forced to make critical and vital decisions based on inadequate information that could be achieved by properly utilising and analysing the available data (Norris, Leonard, & strategic Initiatives Inc., 2008). This gives rise to strategic problems. This setback also depicts itself at the tactical level. Learning and teaching at institutions of higher education if often a diverse and complex experience. Each and every teacher, student or course is quite different. However, [[Learning_management_system|LMS]] is tasked with taking care of them all. LMS is at the centre of academic analytics. It records each and every student and staff's information and results in a click within the system. When this crucial information is added, compared and contrasted with different enterprise information systems provides the institution with a vast array of useful information that can be harvested to gain a competitive edge (Dawson & McWilliam, 2008; Goldstein, 2005; Heathcoate & Dawson, 2005).\n\nIn order to retrieve meaningful information from institution sources i.e. LMS, the information has to be correctly interpreted against a basis of educational efficiency, and this action requires analysis from people with learning and teaching skills.

As such, academic analytics possesses the ability to improve learning, student success and teaching. Analytics has become a valuable tool for institutions because of its ability to predict, model and improve decision making.\n\n== Analytic Steps ==\n\nAnalysis is made up of five basic steps: capture, report, predict, act and refine\nCapture: All analytic efforts are centred on data. Consequently, academic analytics can be rooted in data from various sources such as a CMS, and financial systems (Campbell, Finnegan,  & Collins, 2006). Additionally, the data comes in various different formats for example [[Spreadsheet|spread sheets]]. Also, data can be got from the institution's external environment. To capture data, academic analytics needs to determine the type of available data, methods of harnessing it and the formats it is in. \nReport: After the data has been captured and stored in a central location, analysts will examine the data, perform [[Information retrieval|queries]], identify patterns, trends and exceptions depicted by the data. The standard deviation and mean ([[descriptive statistics]]) are mostly generated.\n\nPredict: After analysing the warehoused data through the use of statistics, a [[Predictive modelling|predictive model]] is developed. These models vary depending on the question nature and type of data. To develop a probability, these models employ [[Regression analysis|statistical regression]] concepts and techniques. Predictions are made after the use of statistical algorithms.\n\nAct:  The major goal and aim of analytics is to enable the institution to take actions based on the probabilities and predictions made. These actions might vary from invention to information. The interventions to address problems might be in the form of a personal email, phone call or an automated contact from faculty advisors about study resources and skills, such as office hours or help sessions. Undoubtedly, institutions have to come up with appropriate mechanisms for impact measurement; such as did the students actually respond or attend the help sessions when invited.\nRefine: Academic analytics should also be made up of a process aimed at self-improvement. Statistics processes should be continually updated since the measurement of project impacts is not a one-time static effort but rather a continual effort. For instance, admission analytics should be updated or revised yearly.\n\n===Comprehending Involved Stakeholders===\nAnalytics affects executive officers, students, faculty members, IT staff and student affairs staff. Whereas students will be keen to know academic analytics will affect their grades, faculty members will be interested in finding out how the information and data can be appropriated for other purposes (Pistilli, Arnold & Bethune, 2012). Moreover, the institution staff will be focussed on finding how the analysis will enable them to effectively accomplish their jobs while the institution president will be focussed on freshman retention and increase in graduation rates.\n\n== Criticisms ==\n\nAnalytics have been criticised for various reasons such as profiling. Their main use is to profile students into successful and unsuccessful categories. However, some individuals argue that profiling of students tends to bias people's behaviours and expectations (Ferguson, 2012). Additionally, there is no clear guidelines on which profiling issues should be prohibited or allowed in institutions of higher learning.\n\n==References==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20100726103616/http://www.educause.edu/Resources/Browse/Academic%20Analytics/16930 Academic Analytics] in the [[EDUCAUSE]] Resource Library\n\nArnold, K.

According to Campbell & Oblinger (2007), accrediting agencies, [[Government|governments]], [[Parent|parents]] and [[Student|students]] are all calling for the adoption of new modern and efficient ways of improving and monitoring student success. This has ushered the higher education system into an era characterized by increased scrutiny from the various [[Stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholders]]. For instance, the Bradley review acknowledges that [[benchmarking]] activities such as student engagement serve as indicators for gauging the institution's quality (Commonwealth [[Government of Australia]], 2008).\n\nIncreased competition, [[accreditation]], assessment and regulation are the major factors encouraging the adoption of analytics in [[higher education]]. Although institutions of higher learning gather a lot of vital data that can significantly aid in solving problems like attrition and retention, the collected data is not being analysed adequately and hence translated into useful data (Goldstein, 2005.) Subsequently, higher education leadership are forced to make critical and vital decisions based on inadequate information that could be achieved by properly utilising and analysing the available data (Norris, Leonard, & strategic Initiatives Inc., 2008). This gives rise to strategic problems. This setback also depicts itself at the tactical level. Learning and teaching at institutions of higher education if often a diverse and complex experience. Each and every teacher, student or course is quite different. However, [[Learning_management_system|LMS]] is tasked with taking care of them all. LMS is at the centre of academic analytics. It records each and every student and staff's information and results in a click within the system. When this crucial information is added, compared and contrasted with different enterprise information systems provides the institution with a vast array of useful information that can be harvested to gain a competitive edge (Dawson & McWilliam, 2008; Goldstein, 2005; Heathcoate & Dawson, 2005).\n\nIn order to retrieve meaningful information from institution sources i.e. LMS, the information has to be correctly interpreted against a basis of educational efficiency, and this action requires analysis from people with learning and teaching skills. Therefore, a collaborative approach is required from both the people guarding the data and those who will interpret it, otherwise the data will remain to be a total waste (Baepler & Murdoch, 2010). Decision making at its most basic level is based on presumption or intuition (a person can make conclusions and decisions based on experience without having to do data analysis) (Siemens & Long, 2011).

The sales lady has her try on several hats, but Granny seems unsatisfied with each choice (a Napoleon chapeau makes her imitate Napoleon's hand in coat pose and chuckle \"Not tonight, Josephine!\"). Meanwhile, Sylvester is chasing Tweety outside and Tweety makes his way into the hat shop.  Just as Tweety hides at a table, Sylvester runs in and tries to rummage through the hats to look for him, but the sales lady catches him in the act, and chases him out.  Just as the sales lady comes to the table where Tweety is hiding, Tweety stands real still on a hat, making the sales lady think that he's a cute little stuffed bird on a hat.  After Granny tries it on, she thinks the same thing and buys the hat.\n\nTweety soon realizes the joys of being said \"stuffed bird\" has a two-fold purpose, the second being that it is perfect refuge from Sylvester. But as usual, the puddy tat does everything to get at the bird, first following Granny out of the hat shop. The first time, Granny turns around, but sees Sylvester pretending to sleep.  The second time, Granny quickly gets wise and swats the baritone cat with her umbrella.\n\nOther failed attempts for Sylvester to get Tweety include:\n\n* Perching himself atop a delivery truck. Just as he is about to grab dinner, the truck speeds away, requiring the cat to take the crosstown bus to return downtown. Sylvester then barely avoids getting hit by an oncoming car, causing his heart to beat fast and his fur to go white.\n* Hiding inside an English gentleman's hat. The man walks up beside Granny and makes a snide remark, just as Sylvester is making a grab for Tweety. Granny uses her umbrella to clout the man and \u2014 unwitting \u2014 the cat.\n* Following Granny into Lacy's Department Store (a play on [[Macy's]]) and into an elevator. The cat's tail gets stuck in the elevator door, and when he finally disembarks the elevator, his tail has been stretched from the store's eight floors.\n* At J.C. Denny's (a pun on [[J. C. Penney]]), the cat snatching Granny's hat with the obvious intent of getting Tweety. Granny follows the thieving cat outside, but Sylvester makes his getaway by putting the hat on and using a balloon to float to safety ... until Tweety pops the balloon. The hat glides to the street undamaged (where Granny retrieves it), while Sylvester plummets into a manhole (\"Whoo-hoo-hoo. Hey, look at this, Ralph! A pussycat!\" says an [[Ed Norton (Honeymooners)|Ed Norton]]-esque sewer worker).\n* Later, using a bellows to blow Granny's hat from her head, causing it to go onto the street. Sylvester barely avoids getting hit by several cars and recovers the hat, but he is struck by a motorscooter driving from an alley.  Granny manages to retrieve the hat safely.\n\nIn the ending gag, Sylvester uses a fishing rod and reel to latch onto the hat.

The sales lady has her try on several hats, but Granny seems unsatisfied with each choice (a Napoleon chapeau makes her imitate Napoleon's hand in coat pose and chuckle \"Not tonight, Josephine!\"). Meanwhile, Sylvester is chasing Tweety outside and Tweety makes his way into the hat shop.  Just as Tweety hides at a table, Sylvester runs in and tries to rummage through the hats to look for him, but the sales lady catches him in the act, and chases him out.  Just as the sales lady comes to the table where Tweety is hiding, Tweety stands real still on a hat, making the sales lady think that he's a cute little stuffed bird on a hat.  After Granny tries it on, she thinks the same thing and buys the hat.\n\nTweety soon realizes the joys of being said \"stuffed bird\" has a two-fold purpose, the second being that it is perfect refuge from Sylvester. But as usual, the puddy tat does everything to get at the bird, first following Granny out of the hat shop. The first time, Granny turns around, but sees Sylvester pretending to sleep.  The second time, Granny quickly gets wise and swats the baritone cat with her umbrella.\n\nOther failed attempts for Sylvester to get Tweety include:\n\n* Perching himself atop a delivery truck. Just as he is about to grab dinner, the truck speeds away, requiring the cat to take the crosstown bus to return downtown. Sylvester then barely avoids getting hit by an oncoming car, causing his heart to beat fast and his fur to go white.\n* Hiding inside an English gentleman's hat. The man walks up beside Granny and makes a snide remark, just as Sylvester is making a grab for Tweety. Granny uses her umbrella to clout the man and \u2014 unwitting \u2014 the cat.\n* Following Granny into Lacy's Department Store (a play on [[Macy's]]) and into an elevator. The cat's tail gets stuck in the elevator door, and when he finally disembarks the elevator, his tail has been stretched from the store's eight floors.\n* At J.C. Denny's (a pun on [[J. C. Penney]]), the cat snatching Granny's hat with the obvious intent of getting Tweety. Granny follows the thieving cat outside, but Sylvester makes his getaway by putting the hat on and using a balloon to float to safety ... until Tweety pops the balloon. The hat glides to the street undamaged (where Granny retrieves it), while Sylvester plummets into a manhole (\"Whoo-hoo-hoo. Hey, look at this, Ralph! A pussycat!\" says an [[Ed Norton (Honeymooners)|Ed Norton]]-esque sewer worker).\n* Later, using a bellows to blow Granny's hat from her head, causing it to go onto the street. Sylvester barely avoids getting hit by several cars and recovers the hat, but he is struck by a motorscooter driving from an alley.  Granny manages to retrieve the hat safely.\n\nIn the ending gag, Sylvester uses a fishing rod and reel to latch onto the hat. Granny gets into a taxi, and Sylvester is pulled away by the speeding driver. After being an unwilling car skier for several city blocks (and nearly getting hit by two trucks), Sylvester eventually realizes he needs to reel himself in ... which he does to open the taxi's sunroof and grab Tweety. Just after saying his only line in the cartoon \u2014 \"Now I've got you, buster!\" \u2014 the car drives into the [[Holland Tunnel]], where the cat hits his head against the side of the entrance; the bird flies out of his hand and back safely onto the taxicab's roof. \"You know, I wose more puddy tats that way!\" remarks Tweety as the cartoon ends with the word \"Oshimai!\".\n\n==Score==\n\"A Bird in a Bonnet\" is one of six cartoons scored with stock music by John Seely from the Capitol Records [[Hi-Q (production music)|Hi-Q]] library because of a musician's strike in 1958; the others are ''[[Weasel While You Work]]'', ''[[Hip Hip-Hurry!]]'', ''[[Hook, Line and Stinker]]'', ''[[Gopher Broke]]'', and ''[[Pre-Hysterical Hare]]''.

[[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] chronicler [[John the Deacon (Venetian chronicler)|John the Deacon]] recorded that at that time Pietro, son of the [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] doge [[Orso II Participazio|Ursus Particiacus II]] (912\u2013932), was treacherously captured on his return from a [[diplomatic mission]] to [[Constantinople]] by Michael, \"a prince of the [[Slavs]]\" (''dux Sclavorum''), when he wanted to pass through the lands of the Croats. Before Pietro entered Croatia, on his way home, when he entered Zahumlje, or when he entered province of [[Narenta]] or [[Pagania]], Michael ''dux Sclavorum'' had him captured and sent as a gift to [[Simeon I of Bulgaria]].{{sfn|Diacono Giovanni|1890|p=131\u2013132. 'qui dum Chroatorum fines rediens transire vellet, a Michahele Sclavorum duce fraude deceptus, omnibusque bonis privatus, atque Vulgarico regi, Simeoni nomine, exilii pena transmissus est'}}{{sfn|Uzelac|2018|p=237, 239}}<ref>Runciman, ''The Emperor Romanus Lecapenus and his reign:'', p. 223</ref> Since 912, Michael was a close ally of [[Simeon I of Bulgaria]], who had been mounting a number of successful campaigns against the [[Byzantine Empire]].\n\nSimeon's march for power posed such a great threat to the Byzantine Empire that it looked for allies in the area. [[Leo Rhabduchus]], the ''[[strategos]]'' of [[Theme of Dyrrhachium|Dyrrhachium]], found one such ally in Serbia, [[Petar Gojnikovi\u0107|Peter Gojnikovi\u0107]], who had been subject to Bulgaria since 897. Peter had been busy extending his power westwards, and appears to have come into territorial conflict with Michael in the process of doing so.<ref name=Fine149 /> Constantine writes that Michael, \"his jealousy aroused by this\", warned Symeon of the conspiracy. Symeon attacked Serbia and captured Peter, who died in prison.{{sfnm|1a1=Moravcsik|1a2=Jenkins|1y=1967|1p=156\u2013159}} Most scholars prefer to date the war on Serbia to 917, after 20 August, when Simeon had [[Battle of Acheloos|massacred]] much of the invading Byzantine army at its landing place at [[Pomorie|Anchialos]]. In 924, Simeon conquered Serbia and, instead of appointing a vassal to govern on his behalf, placed it under his direct authority. In effect, Simeon became a neighbour of Michael and of Croatia, which was then under [[King Tomislav]] and had good relations with Byzantium.<ref name=Fine1986-160>Fine, ''The early medieval Balkans'', p. 160.</ref> It seems probable that Michael remained loyal to Simeon until the latter's death in 927.<ref name=Fine1986-160 />\n\n==Church councils in Split, Croatia==\n<!--\n[[File:IoannesX.jpg|right|thumb|In his letter to [[Tomislav of Croatia|Tomislav]], the [[Pope John X]] describes Michael as excellent leader of Zahumlje.]]\n-->\nThe sources show Michael involved in important church affairs which were conducted on Croatian territory in the mid-920s. Two church councils were convened in [[Split, Croatia|Split]] ({{lang-la|Spalatum}}), in 925 and 928, which officially established or confirmed the recognition of Split as the archiepiscopal see of all [[Dalmatia]] (rather than just the Byzantine cities).<ref>Fine, ''The early medieval Balkans'', p. 260</ref><ref name=Fine2006-55>Fine, ''When ethnicity did not matter in the Balkans'', p. 55.</ref> Another major issue of concern was the language of liturgy: since the [[History of Christianity#Conversion of the Slavs|conversion of the Slavs]] by [[Cyril and Methodius]] in the previous century, the Slavic church was accustomed to use [[Old Church Slavonic|Slavonic]] rather than Latin for its church services.\n\nThe ''[[Historia Salonitana]]'', whose composition may have begun in the late 13th century, cites a letter of [[Pope John X]] to [[Tomislav of Croatia|Tomislav]], \"king (''rex'') of the Croats\", in which he refers to the first council in some detail. If the letter is authentic, it shows that the council was attended not only by the bishops of Croatian and Byzantine Dalmatia, but also by Tomislav, whose territory also included the Byzantine cities of Dalmatia, and by a number of Michael's representatives.<ref name=Fine2006-55 /> In this letter, John describes Michael as \"the most excellent leader of the Zachlumi\" (''excellentissimus dux Chulmorum'').{{sfn|Vlasto|1970|p=209}}\n<!--This is a GA, where  everything must be verifiable\nMichael is mentioned in the same context as the Croatian king in ''[[Illyricum Sacrum]]'' by [[Daniele Farlati]].{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}\n-->\nThe sources have nothing to say about the nature of the relationship between Michael and Tomislav. Some historians have taken Michael's participation at the church council as evidence for the idea that Michael had switched allegiance to Croatia. [[John V. A. Fine]], however, rejects this line of reasoning, saying that the events represented an important ecclesiastical affair for all Dalmatia and stood under papal authority. Moreover, Michael appears to have retained a neutral position when [[Croatian\u2013Bulgarian wars|Croatia and Bulgaria were at war in 926]] and so it may be that Michael was on good terms with the rulers of both lands at the same time.<ref name=Fine1986-160 />\n\nOn 10 July 926, 'Michael, rex Sclavorum' took possession of the port of Siponto, controlled by Byzantium. Therefore, it seems certain that in July 926 Michael did not act as an imperial ally in Apulia, nor his fleet descended upon the shores of the Apennine peninsula as a rescue force against Arabs, Lombards or any other enemy. The only enemy that threatened Siponto in 926 was Michael, 'rex Sclavorum' as Bulgarian ally.{{sfn|Uzelac|2018|p=242-244}}\nMichael apparently sacked [[Siponto]] ({{lang-la|Sipontum}}), which was a Byzantine town in [[Apulia]] on 10 July 926.<ref name=Racki15 /> It remains unknown if he did this by Tomislav's supreme command as suggested by some historians. According to Omr\u010danin, Tomislav sent the Croatian navy under Michael's leadership to drive the [[Saracen]]s from that part of southern [[Italy]] and free the city.<ref>Omr\u010danin, ''Military history of Croatia:'', p. 24</ref> Interesting, Constantine in his ''[[De administrando imperio]]'' makes no mention of Michael's raid, nor does he mention Church councils in Split.<ref>Runciman, ''The Emperor Romanus Lecapenus and his reign:'', p. 210</ref>\n\n==Later years==\nConstantine remembers Michael as a prince (''[[archon]]'') of the Zachlumi, but also uses such grand titles of the Byzantine court as ''[[anthypatos]]'' and patrician (''[[patrikios]]'') to describe his political rank and status.<ref name=Curta210 />{{sfnm|1a1=Moravcsik|1a2=Jenkins|1y=1967|1p=160\u2013163. \"The family of the proconsul and patrician Michael, ...}}<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=PjMts15kLz0C&pg=PA268&dq=%22Michael+of+Zachlumia%22&hl=nl&ei=aI56TOPTPI_UtQOgxqHtCg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&ved=0CC0Q6AEwAQ Ostrogorski, ''History of the Byzantine state''], p. 268.</ref> These titles have been interpreted as reflecting a more subordinate position after Simeon's death in 927, when Michael lost the Bulgarian support needed for any higher recognition.<ref name=Fine1986-160 /> Michael does not appear in the sources for events after 925,{{sfn|Vlasto|1970|p=209}} but historian Fine thinks that his reign lasted into the 940s.<ref name=Fine1986-160 /> [[\u010caslav Klonimirovi\u0107|\u010caslav]], who became ruler of Serbia after Symeon's death, may have seized some of Michael's territory while securing his conquest of [[Travunia]].{{sfn|Vlasto|1970|p=209}}\n\n==References==\n\n===Footnotes===\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n{{Refbegin|2}}\n* {{Cite book|last1=Moravcsik|first1=Gy|last2=Jenkins|first2=R.

Most Serbian medieval dynasties originate from Zahumlje or Doclea (present day Montenegro).<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> Bulgaria did not yet border on Zahumlje and a part of Croatia lay between both lands.

[[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] chronicler [[John the Deacon (Venetian chronicler)|John the Deacon]] recorded that at that time Pietro, son of the [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] doge [[Orso II Participazio|Ursus Particiacus II]] (912\u2013932), was treacherously captured on his return from a [[diplomatic mission]] to [[Constantinople]] by Michael, \"a prince of the [[Slavs]]\" (''dux Sclavorum''), when he wanted to pass through the lands of the Croats. Before Pietro entered Croatia, on his way home, when he entered Zahumlje, or when he entered province of [[Narenta]] or [[Pagania]], Michael ''dux Sclavorum'' had him captured and sent as a gift to [[Simeon I of Bulgaria]].{{sfn|Diacono Giovanni|1890|p=131\u2013132. 'qui dum Chroatorum fines rediens transire vellet, a Michahele Sclavorum duce fraude deceptus, omnibusque bonis privatus, atque Vulgarico regi, Simeoni nomine, exilii pena transmissus est'}}{{sfn|Uzelac|2018|p=237, 239}}<ref>Runciman, ''The Emperor Romanus Lecapenus and his reign:'', p. 223</ref> Since 912, Michael was a close ally of [[Simeon I of Bulgaria]], who had been mounting a number of successful campaigns against the [[Byzantine Empire]].\n\nSimeon's march for power posed such a great threat to the Byzantine Empire that it looked for allies in the area. [[Leo Rhabduchus]], the ''[[strategos]]'' of [[Theme of Dyrrhachium|Dyrrhachium]], found one such ally in Serbia, [[Petar Gojnikovi\u0107|Peter Gojnikovi\u0107]], who had been subject to Bulgaria since 897. Peter had been busy extending his power westwards, and appears to have come into territorial conflict with Michael in the process of doing so.<ref name=Fine149 /> Constantine writes that Michael, \"his jealousy aroused by this\", warned Symeon of the conspiracy. Symeon attacked Serbia and captured Peter, who died in prison.{{sfnm|1a1=Moravcsik|1a2=Jenkins|1y=1967|1p=156\u2013159}} Most scholars prefer to date the war on Serbia to 917, after 20 August, when Simeon had [[Battle of Acheloos|massacred]] much of the invading Byzantine army at its landing place at [[Pomorie|Anchialos]]. In 924, Simeon conquered Serbia and, instead of appointing a vassal to govern on his behalf, placed it under his direct authority. In effect, Simeon became a neighbour of Michael and of Croatia, which was then under [[King Tomislav]] and had good relations with Byzantium.<ref name=Fine1986-160>Fine, ''The early medieval Balkans'', p. 160.</ref> It seems probable that Michael remained loyal to Simeon until the latter's death in 927.<ref name=Fine1986-160 />\n\n==Church councils in Split, Croatia==\n<!--\n[[File:IoannesX.jpg|right|thumb|In his letter to [[Tomislav of Croatia|Tomislav]], the [[Pope John X]] describes Michael as excellent leader of Zahumlje.]]\n-->\nThe sources show Michael involved in important church affairs which were conducted on Croatian territory in the mid-920s. Two church councils were convened in [[Split, Croatia|Split]] ({{lang-la|Spalatum}}), in 925 and 928, which officially established or confirmed the recognition of Split as the archiepiscopal see of all [[Dalmatia]] (rather than just the Byzantine cities).<ref>Fine, ''The early medieval Balkans'', p. 260</ref><ref name=Fine2006-55>Fine, ''When ethnicity did not matter in the Balkans'', p. 55.</ref> Another major issue of concern was the language of liturgy: since the [[History of Christianity#Conversion of the Slavs|conversion of the Slavs]] by [[Cyril and Methodius]] in the previous century, the Slavic church was accustomed to use [[Old Church Slavonic|Slavonic]] rather than Latin for its church services.\n\nThe ''[[Historia Salonitana]]'', whose composition may have begun in the late 13th century, cites a letter of [[Pope John X]] to [[Tomislav of Croatia|Tomislav]], \"king (''rex'') of the Croats\", in which he refers to the first council in some detail. If the letter is authentic, it shows that the council was attended not only by the bishops of Croatian and Byzantine Dalmatia, but also by Tomislav, whose territory also included the Byzantine cities of Dalmatia, and by a number of Michael's representatives.<ref name=Fine2006-55 /> In this letter, John describes Michael as \"the most excellent leader of the Zachlumi\" (''excellentissimus dux Chulmorum'').{{sfn|Vlasto|1970|p=209}}\n<!--This is a GA, where  everything must be verifiable\nMichael is mentioned in the same context as the Croatian king in ''[[Illyricum Sacrum]]'' by [[Daniele Farlati]].{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}\n-->\nThe sources have nothing to say about the nature of the relationship between Michael and Tomislav. Some historians have taken Michael's participation at the church council as evidence for the idea that Michael had switched allegiance to Croatia. [[John V. A. Fine]], however, rejects this line of reasoning, saying that the events represented an important ecclesiastical affair for all Dalmatia and stood under papal authority. Moreover, Michael appears to have retained a neutral position when [[Croatian\u2013Bulgarian wars|Croatia and Bulgaria were at war in 926]] and so it may be that Michael was on good terms with the rulers of both lands at the same time.<ref name=Fine1986-160 />\n\nOn 10 July 926, 'Michael, rex Sclavorum' took possession of the port of Siponto, controlled by Byzantium. Therefore, it seems certain that in July 926 Michael did not act as an imperial ally in Apulia, nor his fleet descended upon the shores of the Apennine peninsula as a rescue force against Arabs, Lombards or any other enemy. The only enemy that threatened Siponto in 926 was Michael, 'rex Sclavorum' as Bulgarian ally.{{sfn|Uzelac|2018|p=242-244}}\nMichael apparently sacked [[Siponto]] ({{lang-la|Sipontum}}), which was a Byzantine town in [[Apulia]] on 10 July 926.<ref name=Racki15 /> It remains unknown if he did this by Tomislav's supreme command as suggested by some historians. According to Omr\u010danin, Tomislav sent the Croatian navy under Michael's leadership to drive the [[Saracen]]s from that part of southern [[Italy]] and free the city.<ref>Omr\u010danin, ''Military history of Croatia:'', p. 24</ref> Interesting, Constantine in his ''[[De administrando imperio]]'' makes no mention of Michael's raid, nor does he mention Church councils in Split.<ref>Runciman, ''The Emperor Romanus Lecapenus and his reign:'', p. 210</ref>\n\n==Later years==\nConstantine remembers Michael as a prince (''[[archon]]'') of the Zachlumi, but also uses such grand titles of the Byzantine court as ''[[anthypatos]]'' and patrician (''[[patrikios]]'') to describe his political rank and status.<ref name=Curta210 />{{sfnm|1a1=Moravcsik|1a2=Jenkins|1y=1967|1p=160\u2013163. \"The family of the proconsul and patrician Michael, ...}}<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=PjMts15kLz0C&pg=PA268&dq=%22Michael+of+Zachlumia%22&hl=nl&ei=aI56TOPTPI_UtQOgxqHtCg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&ved=0CC0Q6AEwAQ Ostrogorski, ''History of the Byzantine state''], p. 268.</ref> These titles have been interpreted as reflecting a more subordinate position after Simeon's death in 927, when Michael lost the Bulgarian support needed for any higher recognition.<ref name=Fine1986-160 /> Michael does not appear in the sources for events after 925,{{sfn|Vlasto|1970|p=209}} but historian Fine thinks that his reign lasted into the 940s.<ref name=Fine1986-160 /> [[\u010caslav Klonimirovi\u0107|\u010caslav]], who became ruler of Serbia after Symeon's death, may have seized some of Michael's territory while securing his conquest of [[Travunia]].{{sfn|Vlasto|1970|p=209}}\n\n==References==\n\n===Footnotes===\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n{{Refbegin|2}}\n* {{Cite book|last1=Moravcsik|first1=Gy|last2=Jenkins|first2=R.

Like the WWE Championship belt, the center plate is a large cut out of the WWE logo with diamonds sitting inside an irregular heptagonal plate, but with the capital words \"Universal Champion\" in small print sitting underneath the logo. Just the same, there are gold divider bars that separate the center plate from its two side plates. Each side plate features the same default removable center section as the WWE Championship (the WWE logo over a red globe), which can be customized with the champion's logo.<ref name=\"originaldesign\">{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/summerslam/2016/gallery/wwe-universal-championship-photos#fid-40044827|title=An up-close look at the all-new WWE Universal Championship: photos|publisher=[[WWE]]|date=August 21, 2016|accessdate=August 24, 2016}}</ref> The most prominent difference is the belt's strap, the color of which indicates the brand it is exclusive to. When the belt was first unveiled at SummerSlam 2016, the strap was red to symbolize its exclusivity to the Raw brand, and the underline of the WWE logo on the center plate was black to make it visible (essentially the reverse of the WWE Championship belt).<ref name=\"originaldesign\"/> After the title became exclusive to SmackDown in late 2019, Bray Wyatt introduced a blue strap variation and the underline of the WWE logo was changed from black to red.<ref name=\"SmackDown11152019\">{{cite web|url=https://prowrestling.net/site/2019/11/15/11-15-wwe-friday-night-smackdown-results-powells-review-of-big-e-and-kofi-kingston-vs-the-revival-for-the-smackdown-tag-titles-daniel-bryan-on-miz-tv-bayley-vs-nikki-cross-mustafa-ali-and-shor/|title=11/15 WWE Friday Night Smackdown results: Powell's review of Big E and Kofi Kingston vs. The Revival for the Smackdown Tag Titles, Daniel Bryan on Miz TV, Bayley vs. Nikki Cross, Mustafa Ali and Shorty G put their Team Smackdown spots on the line vs. Robert Roode and Dolph Ziggler|date=November 15, 2019|last=Powell|first=Jason|work=Pro Wrestling Dot Net|accessdate=November 16, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wwe.com/shows/smackdown/gallery/new-look-universal-title-the-fiend-bray-wyatt#fid-40400419|title=Universal Title turns blue with \"The Fiend\" Bray Wyatt's reign: photos|work=[[WWE]].com|accessdate=November 17, 2019}}</ref> \n\nIn addition to the SmackDown version of the belt, Wyatt also introduced a custom version of the championship for his \"Fiend\" character on the November 29 episode of ''SmackDown''.<ref name=\"SmackDown11292019\">{{cite web|url=https://prowrestling.net/site/2019/11/29/11-29-wwe-friday-night-smackdown-results-powells-review-of-a-new-face-in-bray-wyatts-firefly-funhouse-new-days-open-challenge-for-a-smackdown-tag-title-match-roman-reigns-opening-the-show/|title=11/29 WWE Friday Night Smackdown results: Powell's review of a new face in Bray Wyatt's Firefly Funhouse, New Day's open challenge for a Smackdown Tag Title match, Roman Reigns opening the show|date=November 29, 2019|last=Powell|first=Jason|work=Pro Wrestling Dot Net|accessdate=November 30, 2019}}</ref> The custom belt featured The Fiend's face in the place of the center plate.

Like the WWE Championship belt, the center plate is a large cut out of the WWE logo with diamonds sitting inside an irregular heptagonal plate, but with the capital words \"Universal Champion\" in small print sitting underneath the logo. Just the same, there are gold divider bars that separate the center plate from its two side plates. Each side plate features the same default removable center section as the WWE Championship (the WWE logo over a red globe), which can be customized with the champion's logo.<ref name=\"originaldesign\">{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/summerslam/2016/gallery/wwe-universal-championship-photos#fid-40044827|title=An up-close look at the all-new WWE Universal Championship: photos|publisher=[[WWE]]|date=August 21, 2016|accessdate=August 24, 2016}}</ref> The most prominent difference is the belt's strap, the color of which indicates the brand it is exclusive to. When the belt was first unveiled at SummerSlam 2016, the strap was red to symbolize its exclusivity to the Raw brand, and the underline of the WWE logo on the center plate was black to make it visible (essentially the reverse of the WWE Championship belt).<ref name=\"originaldesign\"/> After the title became exclusive to SmackDown in late 2019, Bray Wyatt introduced a blue strap variation and the underline of the WWE logo was changed from black to red.<ref name=\"SmackDown11152019\">{{cite web|url=https://prowrestling.net/site/2019/11/15/11-15-wwe-friday-night-smackdown-results-powells-review-of-big-e-and-kofi-kingston-vs-the-revival-for-the-smackdown-tag-titles-daniel-bryan-on-miz-tv-bayley-vs-nikki-cross-mustafa-ali-and-shor/|title=11/15 WWE Friday Night Smackdown results: Powell's review of Big E and Kofi Kingston vs. The Revival for the Smackdown Tag Titles, Daniel Bryan on Miz TV, Bayley vs. Nikki Cross, Mustafa Ali and Shorty G put their Team Smackdown spots on the line vs. Robert Roode and Dolph Ziggler|date=November 15, 2019|last=Powell|first=Jason|work=Pro Wrestling Dot Net|accessdate=November 16, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wwe.com/shows/smackdown/gallery/new-look-universal-title-the-fiend-bray-wyatt#fid-40400419|title=Universal Title turns blue with \"The Fiend\" Bray Wyatt's reign: photos|work=[[WWE]].com|accessdate=November 17, 2019}}</ref> \n\nIn addition to the SmackDown version of the belt, Wyatt also introduced a custom version of the championship for his \"Fiend\" character on the November 29 episode of ''SmackDown''.<ref name=\"SmackDown11292019\">{{cite web|url=https://prowrestling.net/site/2019/11/29/11-29-wwe-friday-night-smackdown-results-powells-review-of-a-new-face-in-bray-wyatts-firefly-funhouse-new-days-open-challenge-for-a-smackdown-tag-title-match-roman-reigns-opening-the-show/|title=11/29 WWE Friday Night Smackdown results: Powell's review of a new face in Bray Wyatt's Firefly Funhouse, New Day's open challenge for a Smackdown Tag Title match, Roman Reigns opening the show|date=November 29, 2019|last=Powell|first=Jason|work=Pro Wrestling Dot Net|accessdate=November 30, 2019}}</ref> The custom belt featured The Fiend's face in the place of the center plate.

This film centers the plot of an [[Convict|ex-convict]], former [[Boston Police Department|Boston police officer]], whose task is to take down the [[Trinitarios|Trinitario]] drug gang after two Boston officers were murdered. It is very loosely based on the novel ''Wonderland'' by [[Ace Atkins]], and uses the names of characters created by [[Robert B. Parker]]. The film stars [[Mark Wahlberg]], [[Winston Duke]], [[Alan Arkin]], [[Iliza Shlesinger]], [[Bokeem Woodbine]], [[Donald Cerrone]], [[Marc Maron]], and [[Post Malone|Austin Post]] and marks the fifth collaboration between Wahlberg and Berg after ''[[Lone Survivor]]'', ''[[Deepwater Horizon (film)|Deepwater Horizon]]'', ''[[Patriots Day (film)|Patriots Day]]'', and ''[[Mile 22]]''.\n\nThe film was released on March 6, 2020, by [[Netflix]].<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.whats-on-netflix.com/whats-new/new-releases-on-netflix-march-6th-2020/|title=New Releases on Netflix: March 6th, 2020|last=Moore|first=Kasey|date=March 6, 2020|website=What's on Netflix|url-status=live|access-date=March 9, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nDetective Spenser arrives with his partner Driscoll to the home of Captain John Boylan. While questioning about the woman named Gloria Wiesnewski, and the tape footage of Wiesnewski's murder leaked by Cosgrove, the confrontation gets heated, and Spenser beats Boylan senseless and was subsequently sent to prison.\n\nFive years later, Spenser is released, and is picked up by his friend Henry Cimoli. His ex, Cissy is there to his surprise but runs and drives away with Henry.\n\nAt night, Boylan is driving while talking to his daughter over the phone. A truck hits him at a school bus yard and some hooded men drags him out from the car and beats him mercilessly, which his daughter can hear, before he was violently killed. The next morning, a nurse named Letitia Graham comes home to find her husband Terrence dead in car with a gunshot wound to his head. Spenser is prime suspect in Boylan's murder, but was eventually let go by Driscoll as he was in Cimoli's residence during that time. Spenser sees that Terrence is being accused of involvement in the murder, as well as news in the media that he possibly committed suicide out of guilt. Spenser decides to take the case since he personally knew Terrence and knew he was a great cop.\n\nAfter some mishaps and brawls throughout investigation, Spenser goes to Letitia\u2019s apartment after it\u2019s been vandalized, and she gives him an audio recording that Terrence hid between himself and Boylan. The tape confirms that Boylan was a dirty cop, and that Bentwood, Macklin, and Driscoll all worked together, and it was Driscoll who struck the killing blow to Boylan. Spenser brings the tape to the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]], but they deem it insufficient evidence to go after Driscoll and to clear Graham's name.\n\nSpenser finds Bentwood and violently interrogates him. He confesses that there\u2019s a shipment of drugs coming from [[New Hampshire]] to Wonderland, a casino syndicate of the dirty cops and [[Trinitarios|the Trinitarios]]. Spenser and Hawk find the van and run it off the road, taking down two crooks inside (but the other one escapes) before coming across the stash. Spenser is later contacted by Driscoll, who knows that Spenser knows about him, told Spenser that Cimoli has been kidnapped and he forces him to meet at Wonderland within an hour. Cissy and Hawk joins in.\n\nThe three arrives in Wonderland, attacking the criminals and freeing Cimoli. Spenser chases after Driscoll, and engages in a brawl where Spenser was overpowered, but he gained an upper hand against Driscoll. However, he stopped just short of beating him the same way he beat Boylan to avoid returning to jail, and instead [[Citizen's arrest|handcuffed him]]. They leave the dirty cops outside with all the evidence, just as the police, and the FBI arrive to arrest Driscoll and his goons. Terrence Graham was posthumously cleared from all charges.\n\nIn a restaurant, Spenser sees a news report of a church fire from two years earlier, and the Boston fire chief is under arrest though he claims to be innocent. Spenser knows him from before, and predicts that he was about to take the case, which Cissy warns him.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast list|\n* [[Mark Wahlberg]] as [[Spenser (character)|Spenser]]\n* [[Winston Duke]] as Hawk\n* [[Alan Arkin]] as Henry Cimoli\n* [[Iliza Shlesinger]] as Cissy Davis\n* [[Bokeem Woodbine]] as Driscoll\n* [[Marc Maron]] as Wayne Cosgrove\n* [[Post Malone|Austin Post]] as Squeeb\n* James DuMont as \"Tracksuit Charlie\" Bentwood\n* [[Michael Gaston]] as Captain Boylan\n* [[Colleen Camp]] as Mara\n* Hope Olaide Wilson as Letitia \n* Kip Weeks as Macklin\n* Rebecca Gibel as Laurie Boylan\n* [[Big Shug]] as.
