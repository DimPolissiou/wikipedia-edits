The new California theatre was the first on the West Coast to be lighted exclusively with electricity.<ref name=electric/>\n\nThe periodical, ''The Electrical World'',  had the following to say about the new theatre,\n\n<blockquote>The new temple of [[Thespis]] is situated on the site of the famous old California Theatre. It is perfectly fire-proof, and has 19 exits. The main entrance, on Bush street, is formed by a Roman arch of massive proportions and striking design. The vestibule is rectangular in shape, is finished in antique oak panelling, with pilasters and arabesques, and is lighted by thirty-two 16 candle-power lamps and an electrolier of eight 82's. In the beautiful foyer is another large electrolier.\n<br/><br/>\nIn the auditorium, behind the eight proscenium boxes, with dome-shaped canopies supported by columns, rise arches of Indian fretwork carrying pillars surmounted by 88 candle-power lamps enclosed in opalescent globes shaped like pineapples. The ceiling consists of three concave divisions extending from wall to wall parallel with the front of the stage, gradually rising upward, and separated by narrow panels or chords. It is crossed by four bands of dark color, in which, as well as in the chords and fantastic tracery of the decorations, are set numbers of lamps. From the ceiling, over the parquet and near the boxes, depend three rich electroliers similar in design to those throughout the house, formed by a centre fixture of opalescent glass held in cast metal work, with four pendants of the same shape hanging by chains attached to arms radiating from the stem of the fixture. All the electroliers were specially designed by J. M. Wood, of Chicago, the architect.\n<br/><br/>\nThroughout the house the decorations are so designed that lamps in the midst of bands of flowers, dados and carvings, not only afford light, but add hitherto unknown features to the general ornamentation. At the back of the metal and plastic tracery of the boxes, balcony and gallery, panels of cathedral glass are inserted, which soften the radiance of 16 candle-power lamps set behind, and give to the railings the effect of carvings thrown into relief by mellow light. For producing winter and moonlight effects, and as a substitute for calcium light, six movable bunch lights, with silvered reflectors, are provided.\n<br/><br/>\nThe rheostats, which control all the lamps in the house, are of novel design. They are divided into six parts, which are in connection with six step-by-step switches, capable of being operated rapidly and positively. The handles of the switches can be locked to a shaft which runs through all; by tightening the handles of the switches to the shaft every part of the house can be dimmed at once, and by loosening any number, any portions can be regulated at the will of the switch-man. Being equally divided, one-half the lamps in the auditorium can gradually be turned down while the other half is being lighted, producing a fine blending effect. This is probably the only theatre in the country where the switches are so arranged.<ref name=electric/></blockquote>\n\n===Landmark===\nIn 1933, the site was registered as [[California Historical Landmark]] #86.<ref name=CHL>{{cite ohp|86|California Theatre|2012-10-14}}</ref> The landmark marker, located at 430 Bush Street, mentions the January 18, 1869 opening date, and lists a number of artists who played there.<ref name=CHL/>\n\n==Notable artists==\n{{colbegin|colwidth=20em}}\n*[[Edwin Adams (actor)|Edwin Adams]]<ref name=CHL/>\n*[[Lawrence Barrett]]<ref name=CHL/>\n*[[Adele Blood]]<ref>[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1955&dat=19360914&id=v7MhAAAAIBAJ&sjid=iZsFAAAAIBAJ&pg=3918,2733489 ''Reading Eagle'' (Sep 14, 1936) \"Stage Beauty Ends Life With Bullet\"]</ref>\n*[[Edwin Booth]]<ref name=CHL/>\n*[[Hobart Bosworth]]<ref>[http://califtheatre.com/testimonial-benefit-to-hobart-bosworth-california-theatre-july-14-1905/ \"Testimonial Benefit to Hobart Bosworth\"]{{Dead link|date=June 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, California Theatre, July 14, 1905</ref>\n*[[Lotta Crabtree]]<ref name=CHL/>\n*[[Willie Edouin]]<ref name=CHL/>\n*[[Henry Edwards (entomologist)|Harry Edwards]]<ref name=CHL/>\n*[[Inez Fabbri]]<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vmyJniA_1f4C&pg=PA273 |page=273 |title=The Arts of the Prima Donna in the Long Nineteenth Century |first=Rachel |last=Cowgill |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2012 |isbn=0195365887}}</ref>\n*[[John Edward McCullough|John McCullough]]<ref name=CHL/>\n*[[Nellie Melba]]<ref name=NYT/>\n*[[Helena Modjeska]]<ref>[http://muse.jhu.edu/login?auth=0&type=summary&url=/journals/theatre_journal/v062/62.3.holmgren.pdf \"The Art of Playing Patriot: The Polish Stardom of Helena Modjeska\"]</ref>\n*[[Adelaide Neilson]]<ref name=CHL/>\n*[[John T.

At the end of the first season, the large cast and crew of the California traveled to [[Virginia City, Nevada]] to perform for over a month at [[Piper's Opera House]] in popular shows including ''Sea of Ice''. <ref> Eichin, From San Francisco Eastward, 126-127</ref>. By January 3, 1870 the theater had offered its 300th performance with McCullough and Barrett in an intense rivalry highlighted by the fact that McCullough had appeared in twenty-seven leading roles to Barrett's ten. <ref> Rather, ''Bonanza Theater'', 51-52, 56 </ref> By mid-1870 Barrett took a leave of absence and returned to New York City, eventually selling his financial interest to John McCullough.

Coupled with recession on the East Coast, many recognized actors and actresses trekked west to play the California. The cavalcade of stars included [[Dion Boucicault]] in his own creations, [[Lotta Crabtree]], [[William J. Florence]], [[Elizabeth Crocker Bowers]], [[Agnes Booth]] and her husband [[Junius Booth, Jr.]], [[Edwin Booth]], [[Katherine Rodgers Randolph]] and others.<ref> Carolyn Grattan Eichin, ''From San Francisco Eastward:'' ''Victorian Theater in the American West,'' (Reno: University of Nevada Press, 2020),161-184.</ref> In spite of the theatre's success, the Bank of California, which owned the theatre, failed in 1875, as the National Panic of 1873 challenged the financial picture after the short-lived silver boom.

The new California theatre was the first on the West Coast to be lighted exclusively with electricity.<ref name=electric/>\n\nThe periodical, ''The Electrical World'',  had the following to say about the new theatre,\n\n<blockquote>The new temple of [[Thespis]] is situated on the site of the famous old California Theatre. It is perfectly fire-proof, and has 19 exits. The main entrance, on Bush street, is formed by a Roman arch of massive proportions and striking design. The vestibule is rectangular in shape, is finished in antique oak panelling, with pilasters and arabesques, and is lighted by thirty-two 16 candle-power lamps and an electrolier of eight 82's. In the beautiful foyer is another large electrolier.\n<br/><br/>\nIn the auditorium, behind the eight proscenium boxes, with dome-shaped canopies supported by columns, rise arches of Indian fretwork carrying pillars surmounted by 88 candle-power lamps enclosed in opalescent globes shaped like pineapples. The ceiling consists of three concave divisions extending from wall to wall parallel with the front of the stage, gradually rising upward, and separated by narrow panels or chords. It is crossed by four bands of dark color, in which, as well as in the chords and fantastic tracery of the decorations, are set numbers of lamps. From the ceiling, over the parquet and near the boxes, depend three rich electroliers similar in design to those throughout the house, formed by a centre fixture of opalescent glass held in cast metal work, with four pendants of the same shape hanging by chains attached to arms radiating from the stem of the fixture. All the electroliers were specially designed by J. M. Wood, of Chicago, the architect.\n<br/><br/>\nThroughout the house the decorations are so designed that lamps in the midst of bands of flowers, dados and carvings, not only afford light, but add hitherto unknown features to the general ornamentation. At the back of the metal and plastic tracery of the boxes, balcony and gallery, panels of cathedral glass are inserted, which soften the radiance of 16 candle-power lamps set behind, and give to the railings the effect of carvings thrown into relief by mellow light. For producing winter and moonlight effects, and as a substitute for calcium light, six movable bunch lights, with silvered reflectors, are provided.\n<br/><br/>\nThe rheostats, which control all the lamps in the house, are of novel design. They are divided into six parts, which are in connection with six step-by-step switches, capable of being operated rapidly and positively. The handles of the switches can be locked to a shaft which runs through all; by tightening the handles of the switches to the shaft every part of the house can be dimmed at once, and by loosening any number, any portions can be regulated at the will of the switch-man. Being equally divided, one-half the lamps in the auditorium can gradually be turned down while the other half is being lighted, producing a fine blending effect. This is probably the only theatre in the country where the switches are so arranged.<ref name=electric/></blockquote>\n\n===Landmark===\nIn 1933, the site was registered as [[California Historical Landmark]] #86.<ref name=CHL>{{cite ohp|86|California Theatre|2012-10-14}}</ref> The landmark marker, located at 430 Bush Street, mentions the January 18, 1869 opening date, and lists a number of artists who played there.<ref name=CHL/>\n\n==Notable artists==\n{{colbegin|colwidth=20em}}\n*[[Edwin Adams (actor)|Edwin Adams]]<ref name=CHL/>\n*[[Lawrence Barrett]]<ref name=CHL/>\n*[[Adele Blood]]<ref>[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1955&dat=19360914&id=v7MhAAAAIBAJ&sjid=iZsFAAAAIBAJ&pg=3918,2733489 ''Reading Eagle'' (Sep 14, 1936) \"Stage Beauty Ends Life With Bullet\"]</ref>\n*[[Edwin Booth]]<ref name=CHL/>\n*[[Hobart Bosworth]]<ref>[http://califtheatre.com/testimonial-benefit-to-hobart-bosworth-california-theatre-july-14-1905/ \"Testimonial Benefit to Hobart Bosworth\"]{{Dead link|date=June 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, California Theatre, July 14, 1905</ref>\n*[[Lotta Crabtree]]<ref name=CHL/>\n*[[Willie Edouin]]<ref name=CHL/>\n*[[Henry Edwards (entomologist)|Harry Edwards]]<ref name=CHL/>\n*[[Inez Fabbri]]<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vmyJniA_1f4C&pg=PA273 |page=273 |title=The Arts of the Prima Donna in the Long Nineteenth Century |first=Rachel |last=Cowgill |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2012 |isbn=0195365887}}</ref>\n*[[John Edward McCullough|John McCullough]]<ref name=CHL/>\n*[[Nellie Melba]]<ref name=NYT/>\n*[[Helena Modjeska]]<ref>[http://muse.jhu.edu/login?auth=0&type=summary&url=/journals/theatre_journal/v062/62.3.holmgren.pdf \"The Art of Playing Patriot: The Polish Stardom of Helena Modjeska\"]</ref>\n*[[Adelaide Neilson]]<ref name=CHL/>\n*[[John T.

{"title_page": "Liberal hawk", "text_new": "The term '''liberal hawk''' refers to a politically liberal person (in [[Modern liberalism in the United States|the American sense of the term]]) who supports a [[hawkish]], [[Interventionism (politics)|interventionist]] foreign policy. \n\n==Overview==\nPast U.S. presidents [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], [[Harry S. Truman]], [[John F. Kennedy]] and [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] have been described as liberal hawks for their roles in bringing about the US's status as the world's premier military power. The [[Clinton Doctrine]] can also be considered as consistent with this vision. Today the term is most frequently used to describe liberals and [[leftists]] who supported or still support the decision to [[2003 invasion of Iraq|invade Iraq]] in 2003, which was authorized by the [[United States Congress]] and ordered by president [[George W. Bush]]. The war has stirred heated controversy among all political sides of the debate. The American left was divided over the issue of whether going to war in Iraq was the right decision, as some liberals felt that they should support the war, in accordance with the philosophy of [[liberal internationalism]], which had caused them to support military intervention in the past.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www2.kenyon.edu/Depts/Religion/Fac/Adler/Politics/Liberal-quandary.htm|title=The Liberal Quandary Over Iraq|date=December 8, 2002|work=The New York Times Magazine}}</ref>\n\nOne document often cited as promoting a liberal hawkish point of view is ''[[Progressive Internationalism: A Democratic National Security Strategy]]'', published by the Progressive Policy Institute in October 2003.<ref name=\"Liberal Hawk Down\"/> Another document related to this philosophy is a letter to President Bush sent by [[Social Democrats USA]] in February 2003, urging the military overthrow of Saddam Hussein's regime.<ref>[http://www.socialdemocrats.org/IraqLetter3.html Letter to President Bush] sent by [[Social Democrats USA]] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509134106/http://www.socialdemocrats.org/IraqLetter3.html |date=May 9, 2008 }}</ref>\n\nIn January 2004, [[Paul Berman]], [[Thomas Friedman]], [[Christopher Hitchens]], [[George Packer]], [[Kenneth Pollack]], [[Jacob Weisberg]], [[Fareed Zakaria]] and [[Fred Kaplan (journalist)|Fred Kaplan]] participated in a five-day online forum entitled ''Liberal Hawks Reconsider the Iraq War'', in which they discussed whether they had been correct in advocating military action against [[Saddam Hussein]]'s regime. Kaplan by that point had renounced his prior support, but the general consensus among the participants was that, despite the absence of [[weapons of mass destruction]] in Iraq, the war had still been justified on humanitarian grounds.\n\nIn his book ''The Good Fight'', published in 2006, [[Peter Beinart]] renounced his prior support for the Iraq War, saying, \"I was too quick to give up on containment, too quick to think time was on Saddam's side.\"\n\n==Notable people associated==\n[[File:Truman initiating Korean involvement.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Harry S.

The American left was divided over the issue of whether going to war in Iraq was the right decision, as some liberals felt that they should support the war, in accordance with the philosophy of [[liberal internationalism]], which had caused them to support military intervention in the past.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www2.kenyon.edu/Depts/Religion/Fac/Adler/Politics/Liberal-quandary.htm|title=The Liberal Quandary Over Iraq|date=December 8, 2002|work=The New York Times Magazine}}</ref>\n\nOne document often cited as promoting a liberal hawkish point of view is ''[[Progressive Internationalism: A Democratic National Security Strategy]]'', published by the Progressive Policy Institute in October 2003.<ref name=\"Liberal Hawk Down\"/> Another document related to this philosophy is a letter to President Bush sent by [[Social Democrats USA]] in February 2003, urging the military overthrow of Saddam Hussein's regime.<ref>[http://www.socialdemocrats.org/IraqLetter3.html Letter to President Bush] sent by [[Social Democrats USA]] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509134106/http://www.socialdemocrats.org/IraqLetter3.html |date=May 9, 2008 }}</ref>\n\nIn January 2004, [[Paul Berman]], [[Thomas Friedman]], [[Christopher Hitchens]], [[George Packer]], [[Kenneth Pollack]], [[Jacob Weisberg]], [[Fareed Zakaria]] and [[Fred Kaplan (journalist)|Fred Kaplan]] participated in a five-day online forum entitled ''Liberal Hawks Reconsider the Iraq War'', in which they discussed whether they had been correct in advocating military action against [[Saddam Hussein]]'s regime.

A 1925 letter written by the Palestine Department of Antiquities wrote that the bridge was first built in Roman times.<ref name=Petersen186/> This is supported by a Roman [[milestone]] discovered nearby, which given the scarcity of other local structures makes it likely that a Roman river crossing existed at the point.<ref name=Petersen186/>\n\n===Middle ages===\n[[Al-Muqaddasi]] (c. 945/946 - 991),  described \"beyond the lower end of the [[Sea of Galilee|Lake of Tiberias]] is a great bridge, over which lies the road to [[Damascus]]\",<ref>Mukaddasi, 1886, p.
