It does not use leading-edge [[high-lift device]]s, and tracks for rear-mounted flaps are completely enclosed within the airfoil contour.

Founded and managed by the [[Melbourne Cricket Club]], it is the largest stadium in the Southern Hemisphere, the [[List of stadiums by capacity|11th largest globally]], and [[List of cricket grounds by capacity|the second largest cricket ground by capacity]] after [[Motera Stadium]]. The MCG is within walking distance of the [[Melbourne City Centre|city centre]] and is served by [[Richmond railway station, Melbourne|Richmond]] and [[Jolimont railway station|Jolimont]] railway stations, as well as the [[Melbourne tram route 70|route 70 tram]]. It is adjacent to [[Melbourne Park]] and is part of the [[Melbourne Sports and Entertainment Precinct]].\n\nSince it was built in 1853, the MCG has undergone numerous renovations. It served as the centrepiece stadium of the [[1956 Summer Olympics]], the [[2006 Commonwealth Games]] and two [[Cricket World Cup]]s: [[1992 Cricket World Cup|1992]] and [[2015 Cricket World Cup|2015]]. Noted for its role in the development of international cricket, the MCG hosted both the first [[Test cricket|Test]] match and the first [[One Day International]], played between [[Australia cricket team|Australia]] and [[England cricket team|England]] in 1877 and 1971 respectively. It has also maintained strong ties with [[Australian rules football]] since its codification in 1859, and has become the principal venue for [[Australian Football League]] (AFL) matches, including the [[AFL Grand Final]], the [[List of sports attendance figures|world's highest attended league championship event]].\n\nHome to the [[National Sports Museum]], the MCG has hosted other major sporting events, including [[international rules football]] matches between [[Australia international rules football team|Australia]] and [[Ireland international rules football team|Ireland]], international [[rugby union]] matches, [[State of Origin series|State of Origin]] ([[rugby league]]) games, and [[FIFA World Cup qualification|FIFA World Cup qualifiers]]. Concerts and other cultural events are also held at the venue with the record attendance standing at 143,750 for a [[Billy Graham (evangelist)|Billy Graham]] [[Revival meeting|evangelistic crusade]] in 1959. Grandstand redevelopments and [[occupational health and safety]] legislation have limited the maximum seating capacity to approximately 95,000 with an additional 5,000 standing room capacity, bringing the total capacity to 100,024.\n\nThe MCG is listed on the [[Victorian Heritage Register]]<ref>{{cite VHD|1538|Melbourne Cricket Ground|hr=1928|ho=890}}</ref> and was included on the [[Australian National Heritage List]] in 2005.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.environment.gov.au/|title=Department of the Environment and Energy|website=Department of the Environment and Energy|accessdate=14 December 2018}}</ref> Journalist [[Greg Baum]] called it \"a shrine, a citadel, a landmark, a totem\" that \"symbolises Melbourne to the world\".<ref>[[Greg Baum|Baum, Greg]] (24 September 2003).

The club's first game was against a military team at the Old Mint site, at the corner of [[William Street, Melbourne|William]] and [[La Trobe Street, Melbourne|Latrobe Street]]s. Burial Hill (now [[Flagstaff Gardens]]) became its home ground in January 1839, but the area was already set aside for Botanical Gardens and the club was moved on in October 1846, to an area on the south bank of the Yarra about where the [[The Herald and Weekly Times|Herald and Weekly Times]] building is today. The area was subject to flooding, forcing the club to move again, this time to a ground in [[South Melbourne, Victoria|South Melbourne]].\n\nIt was not long before the club was forced out again, this time because of the expansion of the railway. The South Melbourne ground was in the path of Victoria's first steam railway line from Melbourne to Sandridge (now [[Port Melbourne, Victoria|Port Melbourne]]). [[Charles La Trobe|Governor La Trobe]] offered the MCC a choice of three sites; an area adjacent to the existing ground, a site at the junction of [[Flinders Street, Melbourne|Flinders]] and [[Spring Street, Melbourne|Spring Streets]] or a ten-acre (about 4&nbsp;hectares) section of the Government Paddock at Richmond next to Richmond Park.\n\nThis last option, which is now [[Yarra Park]], had been used by Aborigines until 1835. Between 1835 and the early 1860s it was known as the Government or Police Paddock and served as a large [[agistment]] area for the horses of the [[New South Wales Mounted Police|Mounted Police]], [[Border Police of New South Wales|Border Police]] and [[Native Police]].  The north-eastern section also housed the main barracks for the Mounted Police in the [[Port Phillip district]]. In 1850 it was part of a {{convert|200|acre|ha|adj=on}} stretch set aside for public recreation extending from Governor La Trobe's Jolimont Estate to the Yarra River. By 1853 it had become a busy promenade for Melbourne residents.\n\nAn MCC sub-committee chose the Richmond Park option because it was level enough for cricket but sloped enough to prevent inundation. That ground was located where the Richmond, or outer, end of the current MCG is now.\n\nAt the same time the [[Monash Tigers|Richmond Cricket Club]] was given occupancy rights to six acres (2.4&nbsp;hectares) for another cricket ground on the eastern side of the Government Paddock.\n\nAt the time of the land grant the Government stipulated that the ground was to be used for cricket and cricket only. This condition remained until 1933{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}<ref>{{Cite book|title=Remarkable Cricket Grounds|last=Levison|first=Brian|publisher=Pavilion Books|year=2016|isbn=9781911216056|location=Great Britain}}</ref> when the State Government allowed the MCG's uses to be broadened to include other purposes when not being used for cricket.\n\nIn 1863 a corridor of land running diagonally across Yarra Park was granted to the Hobson's Bay Railway and divided Yarra Park from the river. The Mounted Police barracks were operational until the 1880s when it was subdivided into the current residential precinct bordered by Vale Street. The area closest to the river was also developed for sporting purposes in later years including Olympic venues in 1956.\n\n==Stadium development==\n[[File:MCG grandstand.jpg|thumb|left|Grandstand built for the [[England cricket team|English cricket team]]'s [[English cricket team in Australia and New Zealand in 1876\u201377|1877 visit]]]]\nThe first grandstand at the MCG was the original wooden members' stand built in 1854, while the first public grandstand was a 200-metre long 6000-seat temporary structure built in 1861. Another grandstand seating 2000, facing one way to the cricket ground and the other way to the park where football was played, was built in 1876 for the [[English cricket team in Australia and New Zealand in 1876\u201377|1877 visit]] of [[James Lillywhite]]'s English cricket team. It was during this tour that the MCG hosted the world's first [[Test cricket|Test]] match.\n\nIn 1881 the original members' stand was sold to the Richmond Cricket Club for \u00a355. A new brick stand, considered at the time to be the world's finest cricket facility, was built in its place. The foundation stone was laid by [[George V|Prince George of Wales]] and [[Prince Albert Victor, Duke of Clarence and Avondale|Prince Albert Victor]] on 4 July and the stand opened in December that year. It was also in 1881 that a telephone was installed at the ground, and the wickets and goal posts were changed from an east-west orientation to north-south. In 1882 a scoreboard was built which showed details of the batsman's name and how he was dismissed.\n\nWhen the Lillywhite tour stand burnt down in 1884 it was replaced by a new stand which seated 450 members and 4500 public. In 1897, second-storey wings were added to 'The Grandstand', as it was known, increasing capacity to 9,000. In 1900 it was lit with electric light.\n\n[[File:MCG 1914.jpg|thumb|MCG, ca. 1914. The 1881 members' stand is the smaller building on the left]]\nMore stands were built in the early 20th century. An open wooden stand was on the south side of the ground in 1904 and the 2084-seat Grey Smith Stand (known as the New Stand until 1912) was erected for members in 1906. The 4000-seat Harrison Stand on the ground's southern side was built in 1908 followed by the 8000-seat Wardill Stand in 1912. In the 15 years after 1897 the stand capacity at the ground increased to nearly 20,000.\n\nIn 1927 the second brick members' stand was replaced at a cost of \u00a360,000. The Harrison and Wardill Stands were demolished in 1936 to make way for the Southern Stand which was completed in 1937. The Southern Stand seated 18,200 under cover and 13,000 in the open and was the main public area of the MCG. The maximum capacity of the ground under this configuration, as advised by the Health Department, was 84,000 seated and 94,000 standing.<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=The Argus|publication-place=Melbourne, VIC|title=New stands may be needed for Melbourne Cricket Ground|date=27 September 1938|page=20}}</ref>\n\nThe Northern Stand, also known as the Olympic Stand, was built to replace the old Grandstand for the 1956 Olympic Games. By Health Department regulations, this was to increase the stadium's capacity to 120,000; although this was revised down after the [[1956 VFL Grand Final]], which could not comfortably accommodate its crowd of 115,802.<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=The Argus|publication-place=Melbourne, VIC|title=Only 102,000 will get in for Games|date=18 September 1956|page=5}}</ref> Ten years later, the Grey Smith Stand and the open concrete stand next to it were replaced by the Western Stand; the [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh|Duke of Edinburgh]] laid a foundation stone for the Western Stand on 3 March 1967, and it was completed in 1968; in 1986, it was renamed the Ponsford Stand in honour of Victorian batsman [[Bill Ponsford]]. This was the stadium's highest capacity configuration, and the all-time record crowd for a sporting event at the venue of 121,696 was set under this configuration in the [[1970 VFL Grand Final]].\n\nThe MCG was the home of Australia's first full colour video scoreboard, which replaced the old scoreboard in 1982, located on Level 4 of the Western Stand, which notably caught fire in 1999 and was replaced in 2000. A second video screen added in 1994 almost directly opposite, on Level 4 of the Olympic stand. In 1985, light towers were installed at the ground, allowing for night football and day-night cricket games.\n\n[[File:MCG99.jpg|thumb|left|View of the Great Southern Stand during the 1998 Boxing Day Test match. The Olympic Stand is visible at the bottom left of the photo.]]\nIn 1988 inspections of the old Southern Stand found [[concrete cancer]] and provided the opportunity to replace the increasingly run-down 50-year-old facility. The projected cost of $100&nbsp;million was outside what the Melbourne Cricket Club could afford so the Victorian Football League took the opportunity to part fund the project in return for a 30-year deal to share the ground. The new Great Southern Stand was completed in 1992, in time for the [[1992 Cricket World Cup]], at a final cost of $150&nbsp;million.\n\n[[File:New Ponsford Stand Construction.jpg|thumb|The Ponsford Stand undergoing reconstruction in 2003.]]\nThe 1928 Members' stand, the 1956 Olympic stand and the 1968 Ponsford stand were demolished one by one between late 2003 to 2005 and replaced with a new structure in time for the [[2006 Commonwealth Games]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ancon.com.au/projects/melbourne-cricket-ground-melbourne|title=Projects|first=Ancon Building|last=Products}}</ref> Despite now standing as a single unbroken stand, the individual sections retain the names of Ponsford, Olympic and Members Stands.

Victoria had played Tasmania (then known as Van Diemen's Land) as early as 1851 but the Victorians had included two professionals in the 1853 team upsetting the Tasmanians and causing a cooling of relations between the two colonies. To replace the disgruntled Tasmanians the Melbourne Cricket Club issued a challenge to play any team in the colonies for [[Australian pound|\u00a3]]1000. Sydney publican William Tunks accepted the challenge on behalf of New South Wales although the Victorians were criticised for playing for money. Ethics aside, New South Wales could not afford the \u00a31000 and only managed to travel to Melbourne after half the team's travel cost of \u00a3181 was put up by Sydney barrister Richard Driver.\n\nThe game eventually got under way on 26 March 1856. The Victorians, stung by criticism over the \u00a31000 stake, argued over just about everything; the toss, who should bat first, whether different pitches should be used for the different innings and even what the umpires should wear.\n\nVictoria won the toss but New South Wales captain George Gilbert successfully argued that the visiting team should decide who bats first. The MCG was a grassless desert and Gilbert, considering players fielded without boots, promptly sent Victoria into bat. Needing only 16 to win in the final innings, New South Wales collapsed to be 5 for 5 before Gilbert's batting saved the game and the visitors won by three wickets.<ref>{{cite web|title=Victoria vs. New South Wales, 1855\u201356|url=http://static.espncricinfo.com/db/ARCHIVE/1850S/1855-56/AUS_LOCAL/VIC_NSW_26-27MAR1856.html|website=[[ESPNcricinfo]]|publisher=[[ESPN Inc.]]|accessdate=22 November 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn subsequent years conditions at the MCG improved but the ever-ambitious Melburnians were always on the lookout for more than the usual diet of club and inter-colonial games. In 1861, [[Felix William Spiers]] and Christopher Pond, the proprietors of the Cafe de Paris in Bourke Street and caterers to the MCC, sent their agent, W.B. Mallam, to England to arrange for a cricket team to visit Australia.\n\nMallam found a team and, captained by Heathfield Stephenson, it arrived in Australia on Christmas Eve 1861 to be met by a crowd of more than 3000 people. The team was taken on a parade through the streets wearing white-trimmed hats with blue ribbons given to them for the occasion. Wherever they went they were mobbed and cheered by crowds to the point where the tour sponsors had to take them out of Melbourne so that they could train undisturbed.\n\nTheir first game was at the MCG on New Year's Day 1862, against a Victorian XVIII. The Englishmen also wore coloured sashes around their waists to identify each player and were presented with hats to shade them from the sun. Some estimates put the crowd at the MCG that day at 25,000. It must have been quite a picture with a new 6000 seat grandstand, coloured marquees ringing the ground and a carnival outside. Stephenson said that the ground was better than any in England. The Victorians however, were no match for the English at cricket and the visitors won by an innings and 96 runs.\n\n[[File:MCG-1864.JPG|thumb|1864 match between [[Victoria cricket team|Victoria]] and [[George Parr (cricketer)|George Parr]]'s [[English cricket team in Australia and New Zealand in 1863\u201364|touring All-England Eleven]]]]\nOver the four days of the 'test' more than 45,000 people attended and the profits for Speirs and Pond from this game alone was enough to fund the whole tour. At that time it was the largest number of people to ever watch a cricket match anywhere in the world. Local cricket authorities went out of their way to cater for the needs of the team and the sponsors. They provided grounds and sponsors booths without charge and let the sponsors keep the gate takings. The sponsors however, were not so generous in return. They quibbled with the Melbourne Cricket Club about paying \u00a3175 for damages to the MCG despite a prior arrangement to do so.\n\nThe last match of the tour was against a Victorian XXII at the MCG after which the English team planted an elm tree outside the ground.\n\nFollowing the success of this tour, a number of other English teams also visited in subsequent years. George Parr's side came out in 1863\u201364 and there were two tours by sides led by W.G. Grace. The fourth tour was led by James Lillywhite.\n\nOn Boxing Day 1866 an [[Indigenous Australian]] cricket team played at the MCG with 11,000 spectators against an MCC team. A few players in that match were in a [[1868 Aboriginal cricket tour of England|later team that toured England in 1868]]. Some also played in three other matches at the ground before 1869.\n\n===First Test match===\n[[File:Mcg 1878.jpg|thumb|The MCG in 1878. The first [[Test cricket]] match was played at the MCG in 1877]]\nUp until the fourth tour in 1877, led by [[James Lillywhite|Lillywhite]], touring teams had played [[first-class cricket|first-class]] games against the individual colonial sides, but Lillywhite felt that his side had done well enough against New South Wales to warrant a game against an All Australian team.\n\nWhen Lillywhite headed off to New Zealand he left Melbourne cricketer [[John Conway (cricketer)|John Conway]] to arrange the match for their return. Conway ignored the cricket associations in each colony and selected his own Australian team, negotiating directly with the players. Not only was the team he selected of doubtful representation but it was also probably not the strongest available as some players had declined to take part for various reasons. Demon bowler [[Fred Spofforth]] refused to play because wicket-keeper [[Billy Murdoch]] was not selected. Paceman [[Frank Allan]] was at Warnambool Agricultural Show and Australia's best all-rounder [[Edwin Evans (cricketer)|Edwin Evans]] could not get away from work. In the end only five Australian-born players were selected.\n\nThe same could be said for Lillywhite's team which, being selected from only four counties, meant that some of England's best players did not take part. In addition, the team had a rough voyage back across the [[Tasman Sea]] and many members had been seasick. The game was due to be played on 15 March, the day after their arrival, but most had not yet fully recovered. On top of that, wicket-keeper [[Ted Pooley]] was still in a New Zealand prison after a brawl in a [[Christchurch]] pub.\n\nEngland was nonetheless favourite to win the game and the first ever Test match began with a crowd of only 1000 watching. The Australians elected [[Dave Gregory (cricketer)|Dave Gregory]] from [[New South Wales cricket team|New South Wales]] as Australia's first ever captain and on winning the toss he decided to bat.\n\n[[Charles Bannerman]] scored an unbeaten 165 before retiring hurt. [[Sydney Cricket Ground]] curator, [[Ned Gregory]], playing in his one and only Test for Australia, scored Test cricket's first [[duck (cricket)|duck]]. Australia racked up 245 and 104 while England scored 196 and 108 giving Australia victory by 45 runs. The win hinged on Bannerman's century and a superb bowling performance by [[Tom Kendall]] who took 7 for 55 in England's second innings.\n\nA fortnight later there was a return game, although it was really more of a benefit for the English team. Australia included Spofforth, Murdoch and T.J.D. Cooper in the side but this time the honours went to England who won by four wickets.\n\nTwo years later [[George Harris, 4th Baron Harris|Lord Harris]] brought another England team out and during England's first innings in the Test at the MCG, Fred Spofforth took the first [[Hat-trick (cricket)|hat-trick]] in Test cricket. He bagged two hauls of 6 for 48 and 7 for 62 in Australia's ten wicket win.\n\n===Cricket uses===\nThrough most of the 20th century, the Melbourne Cricket Ground was one of the two major Test venues in Australia (along with the [[Sydney Cricket Ground]]), and it would host one or two Tests in each summer in which Tests were played; since 1982, the Melbourne Cricket Ground has hosted one Test match each summer. Until 1979, the ground almost always hosted its match or one of its matches over the New Year, with the first day's play falling somewhere between 29 December and 1 January; in most years since 1980 and every year since 1995, its test has begun on Boxing Day, and it is now a standard fixture in the Australian cricket calendar and is known as the [[Boxing Day Test]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/records/team/match_results.html?class=1;id=61;type=ground |title=Records / Melbourne Cricket Ground / Test matches / Match results |accessdate=30 August 2015 |publisher=ESPN Cricinfo |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161123192013/http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/records/team/match_results.html?class=1%3Bid%3D61%3Btype%3Dground |archivedate=23 November 2016 }}</ref> The venue also hosts one-day international matches each year, and Twenty20 international matches most years.

Victoria scored 1107 in two days, with [[Bill Ponsford]] scoring 352 and [[Jack Ryder (cricketer)|Jack Ryder]] scoring 295.\n\nOne of the most sensational incidents in Test cricket occurred at the MCG during the Melbourne test of the 1954\u201355 England tour of Australia. Big cracks had appeared in the pitch during a very hot Saturday's play and on the rest day Sunday, groundsman Jack House watered the pitch to close them up. This was illegal and the story was leaked by ''The Age'' newspaper. The teams agreed to finish the match and England won by 128 runs after [[Frank Tyson]] took 7 for 27 in the final innings.\n\nAn incident in the second Test of the 1960\u201361 series involved the [[West Indian cricket team|West Indies]] player [[Joe Solomon]] being given out after his hat fell on the stumps after being bowled at by [[Richie Benaud]]. The crowd sided with the West Indies over the Australians.\n\nNot only was the first Test match played at the MCG, the first [[One Day International]] match was also played there, on 5 January 1971, between Australia and England. The match was played on what was originally scheduled to have been the fifth day of a Test match, but the Test was abandoned after the first three days were washed out.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/150244.html|title=Washout|accessdate=30 August 2015|publisher=ESPN Cricinfo}}</ref> Australia won the 40-over match by 5 wickets.

The match was the idea of former Australian bowler and MCC committee member Hans Ebeling who had been responsible for developing the cricket museum at the MCG. The match had everything. England's Derek Randall scored 174, Australia's Rod Marsh also got a century, Lillee took 11 wickets, and David Hookes, in his first test, smacked five fours in a row off England captain Tony Greig's bowling. Rick McCosker who opened for Australia suffered a fractured jaw after being hit by a sharply rising delivery. He left the field but came back in the second innings with his head swathed in bandages. Australia won the match by 45 runs, exactly the same margin as the first Test in 1877.\n\n[[File:MCG stands.jpg|thumb|left|The second day of the 2006 Boxing Day Test match]]\nAnother incident occurred on 1 February 1981 at the end of a one-day match between Australia and New Zealand. New Zealand, batting second, needed six runs off the last ball of the day to tie the game. Australian captain, Greg Chappell instructed his brother Trevor, who was bowling the last over, to [[Underarm bowling incident of 1981|send the last ball down underarm]] to prevent the New Zealand batsman, Brian McKechnie, from hitting the ball for six. Although not entirely in the spirit of the game, an underarm delivery was quite legal, so long as the arm was kept straight. The Laws of cricket have since been changed to prevent such a thing happening again. The incident has long been a sore point between Australia and New Zealand.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}\n\nIn February and March 1985 the [[Benson & Hedges]] [[World Championship of Cricket]] was played at the MCG, a [[One Day International]] tournament involving all of the then Test match playing countries to celebrate 150 years of the Australian state of [[Victoria, Australia|Victoria]]. Some matches were also played at [[Sydney Cricket Ground]].\n\nThe MCG hosted the [[1992 Cricket World Cup]] Final between [[Pakistani cricket team|Pakistan]] and [[English cricket team|England]] with a crowd of more than 87,000. Pakistan won the match after an all-round performance by [[Wasim Akram]] who scored 33 runs and picked up 3 crucial wickets to make Pakistan cricket world champions for the first and as yet only time.\n\nDuring the 1995 Boxing Day Test at the MCG, Australian umpire [[Darrell Hair]] called [[Sri Lankan cricket team|Sri Lankan]] spin bowler [[Muttiah Muralitharan]] for throwing the ball, rather than bowling it, seven times during the match.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} The other umpires did not call him once and this caused a controversy, although he was later called for throwing by other umpires seven other times in different matches.\n\nThe MCG is known for its great atmosphere,{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} much of which is generated in the infamous [[Bay 13]], situated almost directly opposite to the members stand. In the late 1980s, the crowd at Bay 13 would often mimic the [[warming up|warm up]] [[Stretching#Stretching in preparation for a physical activity|stretches]] performed by [[Merv Hughes]]. In a 1999 One-Day International, the behaviour of Bay 13 was so bad that [[Shane Warne]], donning a helmet for protection, had to enter the ground from his dressing rooms and tell the crowd to settle down at the request of opposing England captain [[Alec Stewart]].\n\n[[File:Cricket World Cup Final (16351625604).jpg|thumb|MCG during the [[2015 Cricket World Cup Final]] with 93,013 in attendance]]\nThe MCG hosted three pool games as part of the [[2015 ICC Cricket World Cup]] as well as a quarter-final, and then the final on 29 March.

Spectator numbers for football are larger than for any other sport in Australia, and it makes more money for the MCG than any of the other sports played there.\n\nAlthough the Melbourne Cricket Club members were instrumental in founding Australian Rules Football, there were understandable concerns in the early days about the damage that might be done to the playing surface if football was allowed to be played at the MCG. Therefore, football games were often played in the parklands next to the cricket ground, and this was the case for the first documented football match to be played at the ground. The match which today is considered to be the first Australian rules football, played between [[Melbourne Grammar]] and [[Scotch College Melbourne|Scotch College]] over three Saturdays beginning 7 August 1858 was played in this area.\n\nIt wasn't until 1869 that football was played on the MCG proper, a trial game involving a police team. It was not for another ten years, in 1879, after the formation of the Victorian Football Association, that the first official match was played on the MCG and the cricket ground itself became a regular venue for football. Two night matches were played on the ground during the year under the newly invented [[electric light]].<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=The Argus|publication-place=Melbourne, VIC|title=Football by electric light|page=7|date=14 August 1879}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|newspaper=The Australasian|publication-place=Melbourne, VIC|title=Football Gossip|author=Peter Pindar|date=16 August 1879|page=204|issue=698|volume=XXVII}}</ref>\n\nIn the early years, the MCG was the home ground of [[Melbourne Football Club]], Australia's oldest club, established in 1858 by the founder of the game itself, Thomas Wills. Melbourne won five premierships during the 1870s using the MCG as its home ground.\n\nThe first of nearly 3000 [[Australian Football League|Victorian Football League/Australian Football League]] games to be played at the MCG was on 15 May 1897, with {{AFL Mel}} beating {{AFL Gee}} 64 to 19.\n\nSeveral Australian Football League (AFL) clubs later joined Melbourne in using the MCG as their home ground for matches: {{AFL Ric}} (1965), {{AFL NM}} (1985), {{AFL Ess}} (1992), {{AFL Col}} (started moving in 1994, became a full-time tenant in 2000) and {{AFL Haw}} (2000). Melbourne used the venue as its training base until 1984, before being required to move to preserve the venue's surface when North Melbourne began playing there.<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=The Age|publication-place=Melbourne, VIC|page=26|author=Ashley Browne|date=7 July 1994|title=$500,000 facelift for Junction Oval}}</ref>\n\n===Finals and grand finals===\nThe [[AFL Grand Final|VFL/AFL grand final]] has been played at the MCG every season since 1902, except in [[1924 VFL season|1924]] when no grand final was held because of the season's round-robin finals format (it hosted three of the six games in the finals series) 1942\u20131945, when the ground was used by the military during World War II; and in [[1991 AFL season|1991]] as the construction of the Great Southern Stand had temporarily reduced the ground's capacity below that of [[Waverley Park]]. All three grand final replays have been played at the MCG.\n\n[[File:Mcg football.jpg|thumb|A sold out MCG during the [[2007 AFL Grand Final]]]]\nBefore the MCG was fully seated, a grand final could draw attendances above 110,000. The record for the highest attendance in the history of the sport was set in the [[1970 VFL Grand Final]], with 121,696 in attendance.\n\nSince being fully seated, grand final attendances are typically between 95,000 and 100,000, with the record of 100,022 in the 2018 grand final, followed by 100,021 at the [[2017 AFL Grand Final]].\n\nIn the modern era, most finals games held in Melbourne have been played at the MCG. Under the current contract, 10 finals (excluding the grand final) must be played at the MCG over a five-year period. Under previous contracts, the MCG was entitled to host at least one match in each week of the finals, which on several occasions required non-Victorian clubs to play \"home\" finals in Victoria. In 2018, the AFL, [[Government of Victoria|Victorian Government]] and Melbourne Cricket Club (MCC) announced that the MCG would continue to host the grand final until at least 2057.<ref name=\"MCG2057\">{{cite web|url=http://www.afl.com.au/news/2018-04-12/gf-at-mcg-until-2057-as-part-of-500m-megadeal|title=Grand Final at MCG until 2057 as part of $500m mega-deal|work=AFL.com.au|date=12 April 2018}}</ref>\n\nAll Melbourne-based teams (and most of the time Geelong) play their \"home\" finals at the MCG unless if four Victorian teams win the right to host a final in the first week of the finals.\n\n===MCG and the VFL/AFL===\nFor many years the VFL had an uneasy relationship with the MCG trustees and the Melbourne Cricket Club. Both needed the other, but resented the dependence. The VFL made the first move which brought things to a head by beginning the development of [[VFL Park]] at [[Mulgrave, Victoria|Mulgrave]] in the 1960s as its own home ground and as a potential venue for future grand finals. Then in 1983, president of the VFL, [[Allen Aylett]] started to pressure the MCG Trust to give the VFL a greater share of the money it made from using the ground for football.\n\nIn March 1983 the MCG trustees met to consider a submission from Aylett. Aylett said he wanted the Melbourne Cricket Club's share of revenue cut from 15 per cent to 10 per cent. He threatened to take the following day's opening game of the season, Collingwood vs Melbourne, away from the MCG. The money was held aside until an agreement could be reached.\n\nDifferent deals, half deals and possible deals were done over the years, with the [[Premier of Victoria]], [[John Cain II|John Cain, Jr.]], even becoming involved. Cain was said to have promised the VFL it could use the MCG for six months of the year and then hand it back to the MCC, but this never eventuated, as the MCG Trust did not approve it. In the mid-1980s, a deal was done where the VFL was given its own members area in the Southern Stand.\n\nAgainst this background of political manoeuvring, in 1985 {{AFL NM}} became the third club to make the MCG its home ground. In the same year, North played in the first night football match at the MCG for almost 110 years, against Collingwood on 29 March 1985.\n\nIn 1986, only a month after [[Ross Oakley]] had taken over as VFL Commissioner, VFL executives met with the MCC and took a big step towards resolving their differences. Changes in the personnel at the MCC also helped. In 1983 [[John Lill (cricketer)|John Lill]] was appointed secretary and [[Don Cordner]] its president.\n\nShortly after the Southern Stand opened in 1992, the Australian Football League moved its headquarters into the complex. The AFL assisted with financing the new stand and came to an agreement that ensures at least 45 AFL games are played at the MCG each year, including the Grand Final in September. Another 45 days of cricket are also played there each year and more than 3.5&nbsp;million spectators come to watch every year.\n\nAs of the end of 2011, [[Matthew Richardson (Australian rules footballer)|Matthew Richardson]] holds the records for having scored the most goals on the MCG and [[Kevin Bartlett (Aussie Rules footballer)|Kevin Bartlett]] holds the record for playing the most matches. Two players have scored 14 goals for an AFL or VFL game in one match at the MCG, [[Gary Ablett, Sr.]] in 1989 and 1993 and [[John Longmire]] in 1990.\n\nBefore an AFL match between {{AFL Ric}} and {{AFL Car}} on 27 August 1999, the city end scoreboard caught on fire due to an electrical fault, causing the start of play to be delayed by half an hour.\n\n{{wide image|MCG Panorama.JPG|1000px|align-cap=center|A panoramic view of the Melbourne Cricket Ground from level 4 of the Northern Stand, First game of the 2010 AFL Season between Richmond and Carlton}}\n\n==World War II==\nDuring [[World War II]], the government requisitioned the MCG for military use. From 1942 until 1945 it was occupied by (in order): the [[United States Army Air Forces]], the [[Royal Australian Air Force]], the [[United States Marine Corps]] and again the RAAF.<ref name=MCGCite>{{cite web|url=http://www.mcg.org.au/History/Other%20Events/US%20Marines.aspx |title=Melbourne Cricket Ground \u2013 US Marines at the MCG |accessdate=10 December 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131218084312/https://www.mcg.org.au/History/Other%20Events/US%20Marines.aspx |archivedate=18 December 2013}}</ref> Over the course of the war, more than 200,000 personnel were barracked at the MCG. From April to October 1942, the US Army's [[Fifth Air Force]] occupied the ground, naming it \"Camp Murphy\", in honor of officer Colonel William Murphy, a senior USAAF officer killed in [[Java]]. In 1943 the MCG was home to the legendary [[1st Marine Regiment (United States)|First Regiment]] of the [[1st Marine Division (United States)|First Division]] of the United States Marine Corps. The First Marine Division were the heroes of the [[battle of Guadalcanal|Guadalcanal campaign]] and used the \"cricket grounds\", as the marines referred to it, to rest and recuperate.<ref name = MCGCite/> On 14 March 1943 the marines hosted a giant \"get together\" of American and Australian troops on the arena.<ref name = MCGCite/>\n\nIn 1977, Melbourne Cricket Club president [[Albert Chadwick|Sir Albert Chadwick]] and [[Medal of Honor]] recipient, Colonel [[Mitchell Paige]], unveiled a commemorative plaque recognizing the Americans' time at the ground.<ref name = MCGCite/>\n\nIn episode 3 of the 2010 TV miniseries, ''[[The Pacific (TV miniseries)|The Pacific]]'', members of the US Marines are shown to be camped in the war-era MCG.\n\n==Olympic Games==\n{{Main|1956 Summer Olympics}}\n\nThe MCG's most famous moment in history was as the main stadium for the 1956 Olympic Games, hosting the opening and closing ceremonies, track and field events, and the finals in field hockey and soccer.<ref>[http://www.la84foundation.org/6oic/OfficialReports/1956/OR1956.pdf 1956 Summer Olympics official report.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080912181829/http://www.la84foundation.org/6oic/OfficialReports/1956/OR1956.pdf |date=12 September 2008 }} p. 40.</ref> The MCG was only one of seven possible venues, including the Melbourne Showgrounds, for the Games' main arena. The MCG was the Federal Government's preferred venue but there was resistance from the MCC. The inability to decide on the central venue nearly caused the Games to be moved from Melbourne. Prime Minister [[Robert Menzies]] recognised the potential embarrassment to Australia if this happened and organised a three-day summit meeting to thrash things out. Attending was Victorian Premier [[John Cain (senior)|John Cain, Sr.]], the Prime Minister, deputy opposition leader [[Arthur Calwell]], all State political leaders, civic leaders, Olympic officials and trustees and officials of the MCC. Convening the meeting was no small effort considering the calibre of those attending and that many of the sports officials were only part-time amateurs.\n\nAs 22 November, the date of the opening ceremony, drew closer, Melbourne was gripped ever more tightly by Olympic fever. At 3&nbsp;pm the day before the opening ceremony, people began to line up outside the MCG gates. That night the city was paralysed by a quarter of a million people who had come to celebrate.\n\nThe MCG's capacity was increased by the new Olympic (or Northern) Stand, and on the day itself 103,000 people filled the stadium to capacity. A young up and coming distance runner was chosen to carry the Olympic torch into the stadium for the opening ceremony.\n\nAlthough [[Ron Clarke]] had a number of junior world records for distances of 1500&nbsp;m, one mile (1.6&nbsp;km) and two miles (3&nbsp;km), he was relatively unknown in 1956. Perhaps the opportunity to carry the torch inspired him because he went on to have a career of exceptional brilliance and was without doubt the most outstanding runner of his day. At one stage he held the world record for every distance from two miles (3&nbsp;km) to 20&nbsp;km. His few failures came in Olympic and Commonwealth Games competition. Although favourite for the gold at Tokyo in 1964 he was placed ninth in the 5,000&nbsp;metres race and the marathon and third in the 10,000&nbsp;metres. He lost again in the [[1966 Commonwealth Games]] and in 1968 at altitude in Mexico he collapsed at the end of the 10&nbsp;km race.\n\nOn that famous day in Melbourne in 1956 the torch spluttered and sparked, showering Clarke with hot magnesium, burning holes in his shirt. When he dipped the torch into the cauldron it burst into flame singeing him further. In the centre of the ground, John Landy, the fastest miler in the world, took the Olympic oath and sculler Merv Wood carried the Australian flag.\n\nThe Melbourne Games also saw the high point of Australian female sprinting with [[Betty Cuthbert]] winning three gold medals at the MCG. She won the 100&nbsp;m and 200&nbsp;m and anchored the winning 4 x 100&nbsp;m team. Born in Merrylands in Sydney's west she was a champion schoolgirl athlete and had already broken the world record for the 200&nbsp;m just before the 1956 Games. She was to be overshadowed by her Western Suburbs club member, the [[Marlene Matthews]]. When they got to the Games, Matthews was the overwhelming favourite especially for the 100&nbsp;m a distance over which Cuthbert had beaten her just once.\n\nBoth Matthews and Cuthbert won their heats with Matthews setting an Olympic record of 11.5&nbsp;seconds in hers. Cuthbert broke that record in the following heat with a time of 11.4&nbsp;seconds. The world record of 11.3 was held by another Australian, Shirley Strickland who was eliminated in her heat. In the final Matthews felt she got a bad start and was last at the 50&nbsp;metre mark. Cuthbert sensed Isabella Daniels from the USA close behind her and pulled out a little extra to win Australia's first gold at the Games in a time of 11.5&nbsp;seconds, Matthews was third. The result was repeated in the 200&nbsp;m final. Cuthbert won her second gold breaking Marjorie Jackson's Olympic record. Mathews was third again.\n\nBy the time the 1956 Olympics came around, [[Shirley Strickland]] was a mother of 31 years of age but managed to defend her 80&nbsp;m title, which she had won in Helsinki four years before, winning gold and setting a new Olympic record.\n\nThe sensational incident of the track events was the non-selection of Marlene Matthews in the 4 x 100&nbsp;m relay. Matthews trained with the relay team up until the selection was made but Cuthbert, Strickland, Fleur Mellor and Norma Croker were picked for the team. There was outrage at the selection which increased when Matthews went on to run third in both the 100&nbsp;m and 200&nbsp;m finals. Personally she was devastated and felt that she had been overlooked for her poor baton change. Strickland was disappointed with the way Matthews was treated and maintained it was an opinion held in New South Wales that she had baton problems. One of the selectors, Doris Magee from NSW, said that selecting Matthews increased the risk of disqualification at the change. But Cuthbert maintained that the selectors made the right choice saying that Fleur Mellor was fresh, a specialist relay runner and was better around the curves than Matthews.\n\nThe men did not fare so well. The 4 x 400&nbsp;m relay team, including later IOC Committee member Kevan Gosper, won silver. Charles Porter also won silver in the high jump. Hec Hogan won bronze in the 100&nbsp;m to become the first Australian man to win a medal in a sprint since the turn of the century and despite injury John Landy won bronze in the 1500&nbsp;m. Allan Lawrence won bronze in the 10,000&nbsp;m event.\n\nApart from athletics, the stadium was also used for the soccer finals, the hockey finals, the Opening and Closing Ceremonies, and an exhibition game of baseball between the Australian National Team and a US armed services team at which an estimated crowd of 114,000 attended. This was the [[Guinness World Record]] for the largest attendance for any baseball game, which stood until a 29 March 2008 exhibition game between the [[Boston Red Sox]] and [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] at the [[Los Angeles Coliseum]] (also a former Olympic venue in [[1932 Summer Olympics|1932]] and [[1984 Summer Olympics|1984]]) drawing 115,300.\n\nThe MCG was also used for another demonstration sport, Australian Rules. The Olympics being an amateur competition meant that only amateurs could play in the demonstration game. A combined team of amateurs from the VFL and VFA were selected to play a state team from the Victorian Amateur Football Association (VAFA). The game was played 7 December 1956 with the VAFA side, wearing white jumpers, green collars and the Olympic rings on their chests, winning easily 81 to 55. One of the players chosen for the VFA side was [[Lindsay Gaze]] (although he never got off the bench) who would go on to make his mark in another sport, [[basketball]], rather than Australian Rules.\n\nThe MCG's link with its Olympic past continues to this day. Within its walls is the IOC-endorsed [[Australian Gallery of Sport and Olympic Museum]].\n\nForty-four years later at the [[2000 Summer Olympics]] in Sydney, the ground hosted several [[Football at the 2000 Summer Olympics|soccer]] preliminaries, making it one of a few venues ever used for more than one Olympics.<ref>[http://www.la84foundation.org/6oic/OfficialReports/2000/2000v1.pdf 2000 Summer Olympics official report.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20001109071400/http://www.olympics.com/eng/ |date=9 November 2000 }} Volume 1. p. 393.</ref>\n\n==Commonwealth Games==\n{{Main|2006 Commonwealth Games}}{{See also|Athletics at the 2006 Commonwealth Games}}\n[[File:MSC, 2006 Commonwealth Games.jpg|thumb|Mellbourne Cricket Ground during the [[2006 Commonwealth Games]]]]\nThe [[2006 Commonwealth Games opening ceremony|Opening]] and [[2006 Commonwealth Games closing ceremony|Closing]] Ceremonies of the [[2006 Commonwealth Games]] were held at the MCG, as well as athletics events during the games. The games began on 15 March and ended on 26 March.\n\nThe seating capacity of the stadium during the games was 80,000. A total of 47 events were contested, of which 24 by male and 23 by female athletes. Furthermore, three men's and three women's [[Disabled sports|disability events]] were held within the programme. All athletics events took place within the Melbourne Cricket Ground, while the [[marathon]] and [[racewalking]] events took place on the streets of [[Melbourne]] and finished at the main stadium.\n\nThe hosts Australia easily won the medals table with 16 golds and 41 medals in total. Jamaica came second with 10 golds and 22 medals, while [[Kenya]] and [[England]] were the next best performers. A total of eleven [[List of Commonwealth Games records in athletics|Games records]] were broken over the course of the seven-day competition. Six of the records were broken by Australian athletes.\n\n==Rugby union==\nThe first game of Rugby Union to be played on the ground was on Saturday, 29 June 1878, when the Waratah Club of Sydney played Carlton Football Club in a return of the previous year's contests in Sydney where the clubs had competed in both codes of football. The match, watched by a crowd of between 6,000 and 7,000 resulted in a draw; one goal and one try being awarded to each team.<ref>The Argus (Melbourne) 1 July 1878</ref><ref name=\"mcc-firstfootball\">{{cite book | url=http://www.mcc.org.au/~/media/Files/First%20Football%20Matches%20at%20the%20MCG.pdf | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130314164458/http://www.mcc.org.au/~/media/Files/First%20Football%20Matches%20at%20the%20MCG.pdf | url-status=dead | archive-date=2013-03-14 | title=The First Football Matches on the Melbourne Cricket Ground | publisher=The Melbourne Cricket Club Library | author=Batchelder, Alf | year=2002 | page=25 | isbn=0957807414}}</ref>\n\nThe next Rugby match was held on Wednesday 29 June 1881, when the Wanderers, a team organised under the auspices of the Melbourne Cricket Club, played a team representing a detached Royal Navy squadron then visiting Melbourne.

Australian sports stadium located in [[Yarra Park]], [[Melbourne]], [[Victoria, Australia|Victoria]]. Founded and managed by the [[Melbourne Cricket Club]], it is the largest stadium in the Southern Hemisphere, the [[List of stadiums by capacity|11th largest globally]], and [[List of cricket grounds by capacity|the second largest cricket ground by capacity]] after [[Motera Stadium]]. The MCG is within walking distance of the [[Melbourne City Centre|city centre]] and is served by [[Richmond railway station, Melbourne|Richmond]] and [[Jolimont railway station|Jolimont]] railway stations, as well as the [[Melbourne tram route 70|route 70 tram]]. It is adjacent to [[Melbourne Park]] and is part of the [[Melbourne Sports and Entertainment Precinct]].\n\nSince it was built in 1853, the MCG has undergone numerous renovations. It served as the centrepiece stadium of the [[1956 Summer Olympics]], the [[2006 Commonwealth Games]] and two [[Cricket World Cup]]s: [[1992 Cricket World Cup|1992]] and [[2015 Cricket World Cup|2015]]. Noted for its role in the development of international cricket, the MCG hosted both the first [[Test cricket|Test]] match and the first [[One Day International]], played between [[Australia cricket team|Australia]] and [[England cricket team|England]] in 1877 and 1971 respectively. It has also maintained strong ties with [[Australian rules football]] since its codification in 1859, and has become the principal venue for [[Australian Football League]] (AFL) matches, including the [[AFL Grand Final]], the [[List of sports attendance figures|world's highest attended league championship event]].\n\nHome to the [[National Sports Museum]], the MCG has hosted other major sporting events, including [[international rules football]] matches between [[Australia international rules football team|Australia]] and [[Ireland international rules football team|Ireland]], international [[rugby union]] matches, [[State of Origin series|State of Origin]] ([[rugby league]]) games, and [[FIFA World Cup qualification|FIFA World Cup qualifiers]]. Concerts and other cultural events are also held at the venue with the record attendance standing at 143,750 for a [[Billy Graham (evangelist)|Billy Graham]] [[Revival meeting|evangelistic crusade]] in 1959. Grandstand redevelopments and [[occupational health and safety]] legislation have limited the maximum seating capacity to approximately 95,000 with an additional 5,000 standing room capacity, bringing the total capacity to 100,024.\n\nThe MCG is listed on the [[Victorian Heritage Register]]<ref>{{cite VHD|1538|Melbourne Cricket Ground|hr=1928|ho=890}}</ref> and was included on the [[Australian National Heritage List]] in 2005.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.environment.gov.au/|title=Department of the Environment and Energy|website=Department of the Environment and Energy|accessdate=14 December 2018}}</ref> Journalist [[Greg Baum]] called it \"a shrine, a citadel, a landmark, a totem\" that \"symbolises Melbourne to the world\".<ref>[[Greg Baum|Baum, Greg]] (24 September 2003).

In the background is the original MCC pavilion, built in 1854.]]\nFounded in November 1838 the Melbourne Cricket Club (MCC) selected the current MCG site in 1853 after previously playing at several grounds around Melbourne. The club's first game was against a military team at the Old Mint site, at the corner of [[William Street, Melbourne|William]] and [[La Trobe Street, Melbourne|Latrobe Street]]s. Burial Hill (now [[Flagstaff Gardens]]) became its home ground in January 1839, but the area was already set aside for Botanical Gardens and the club was moved on in October 1846, to an area on the south bank of the Yarra about where the [[The Herald and Weekly Times|Herald and Weekly Times]] building is today. The area was subject to flooding, forcing the club to move again, this time to a ground in [[South Melbourne, Victoria|South Melbourne]].\n\nIt was not long before the club was forced out again, this time because of the expansion of the railway. The South Melbourne ground was in the path of Victoria's first steam railway line from Melbourne to Sandridge (now [[Port Melbourne, Victoria|Port Melbourne]]). [[Charles La Trobe|Governor La Trobe]] offered the MCC a choice of three sites; an area adjacent to the existing ground, a site at the junction of [[Flinders Street, Melbourne|Flinders]] and [[Spring Street, Melbourne|Spring Streets]] or a ten-acre (about 4&nbsp;hectares) section of the Government Paddock at Richmond next to Richmond Park.\n\nThis last option, which is now [[Yarra Park]], had been used by Aborigines until 1835. Between 1835 and the early 1860s it was known as the Government or Police Paddock and served as a large [[agistment]] area for the horses of the [[New South Wales Mounted Police|Mounted Police]], [[Border Police of New South Wales|Border Police]] and [[Native Police]].  The north-eastern section also housed the main barracks for the Mounted Police in the [[Port Phillip district]]. In 1850 it was part of a {{convert|200|acre|ha|adj=on}} stretch set aside for public recreation extending from Governor La Trobe's Jolimont Estate to the Yarra River. By 1853 it had become a busy promenade for Melbourne residents.\n\nAn MCC sub-committee chose the Richmond Park option because it was level enough for cricket but sloped enough to prevent inundation. That ground was located where the Richmond, or outer, end of the current MCG is now.\n\nAt the same time the [[Monash Tigers|Richmond Cricket Club]] was given occupancy rights to six acres (2.4&nbsp;hectares) for another cricket ground on the eastern side of the Government Paddock.\n\nAt the time of the land grant the Government stipulated that the ground was to be used for cricket and cricket only. This condition remained until 1933{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}<ref>{{Cite book|title=Remarkable Cricket Grounds|last=Levison|first=Brian|publisher=Pavilion Books|year=2016|isbn=9781911216056|location=Great Britain}}</ref> when the State Government allowed the MCG's uses to be broadened to include other purposes when not being used for cricket.\n\nIn 1863 a corridor of land running diagonally across Yarra Park was granted to the Hobson's Bay Railway and divided Yarra Park from the river. The Mounted Police barracks were operational until the 1880s when it was subdivided into the current residential precinct bordered by Vale Street. The area closest to the river was also developed for sporting purposes in later years including Olympic venues in 1956.\n\n==Stadium development==\n[[File:MCG grandstand.jpg|thumb|left|Grandstand built for the [[England cricket team|English cricket team]]'s [[English cricket team in Australia and New Zealand in 1876\u201377|1877 visit]]]]\nThe first grandstand at the MCG was the original wooden members' stand built in 1854, while the first public grandstand was a 200-metre long 6000-seat temporary structure built in 1861. Another grandstand seating 2000, facing one way to the cricket ground and the other way to the park where football was played, was built in 1876 for the [[English cricket team in Australia and New Zealand in 1876\u201377|1877 visit]] of [[James Lillywhite]]'s English cricket team. It was during this tour that the MCG hosted the world's first [[Test cricket|Test]] match.\n\nIn 1881 the original members' stand was sold to the Richmond Cricket Club for \u00a355. A new brick stand, considered at the time to be the world's finest cricket facility, was built in its place. The foundation stone was laid by [[George V|Prince George of Wales]] and [[Prince Albert Victor, Duke of Clarence and Avondale|Prince Albert Victor]] on 4 July and the stand opened in December that year. It was also in 1881 that a telephone was installed at the ground, and the wickets and goal posts were changed from an east-west orientation to north-south. In 1882 a scoreboard was built which showed details of the batsman's name and how he was dismissed.\n\nWhen the Lillywhite tour stand burnt down in 1884 it was replaced by a new stand which seated 450 members and 4500 public. In 1897, second-storey wings were added to 'The Grandstand', as it was known, increasing capacity to 9,000. In 1900 it was lit with electric light.\n\n[[File:MCG 1914.jpg|thumb|MCG, ca. 1914. The 1881 members' stand is the smaller building on the left]]\nMore stands were built in the early 20th century. An open wooden stand was on the south side of the ground in 1904 and the 2084-seat Grey Smith Stand (known as the New Stand until 1912) was erected for members in 1906. The 4000-seat Harrison Stand on the ground's southern side was built in 1908 followed by the 8000-seat Wardill Stand in 1912. In the 15 years after 1897 the stand capacity at the ground increased to nearly 20,000.\n\nIn 1927 the second brick members' stand was replaced at a cost of \u00a360,000. The Harrison and Wardill Stands were demolished in 1936 to make way for the Southern Stand which was completed in 1937. The Southern Stand seated 18,200 under cover and 13,000 in the open and was the main public area of the MCG.

This was the stadium's highest capacity configuration, and the all-time record crowd for a sporting event at the venue of 121,696 was set under this configuration in the [[1970 VFL Grand Final]].\n\nThe MCG was the home of Australia's first full colour video scoreboard, which replaced the old scoreboard in 1982, located on Level 4 of the Western Stand, which notably caught fire in 1999 and was replaced in 2000. A second video screen added in 1994 almost directly opposite, on Level 4 of the Olympic stand. In 1985, light towers were installed at the ground, allowing for night football and day-night cricket games.\n\n[[File:MCG99.jpg|thumb|left|View of the Great Southern Stand during the 1998 Boxing Day Test match. The Olympic Stand is visible at the bottom left of the photo.]]\nIn 1988 inspections of the old Southern Stand found [[concrete cancer]] and provided the opportunity to replace the increasingly run-down 50-year-old facility. The projected cost of $100&nbsp;million was outside what the Melbourne Cricket Club could afford so the Victorian Football League took the opportunity to part fund the project in return for a 30-year deal to share the ground. The new Great Southern Stand was completed in 1992, in time for the [[1992 Cricket World Cup]], at a final cost of $150&nbsp;million.\n\n[[File:New Ponsford Stand Construction.jpg|thumb|The Ponsford Stand undergoing reconstruction in 2003.]]\nThe 1928 Members' stand, the 1956 Olympic stand and the 1968 Ponsford stand were demolished one by one between late 2003 to 2005 and replaced with a new structure in time for the [[2006 Commonwealth Games]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ancon.com.au/projects/melbourne-cricket-ground-melbourne|title=Projects|first=Ancon Building|last=Products}}</ref> Despite now standing as a single unbroken stand, the individual sections retain the names of Ponsford, Olympic and Members Stands.

Victoria had played Tasmania (then known as Van Diemen's Land) as early as 1851 but the Victorians had included two professionals in the 1853 team upsetting the Tasmanians and causing a cooling of relations between the two colonies. To replace the disgruntled Tasmanians the Melbourne Cricket Club issued a challenge to play any team in the colonies for [[Australian pound|\u00a3]]1000. Sydney publican William Tunks accepted the challenge on behalf of New South Wales although the Victorians were criticised for playing for money. Ethics aside, New South Wales could not afford the \u00a31000 and only managed to travel to Melbourne after half the team's travel cost of \u00a3181 was put up by Sydney barrister Richard Driver.\n\nThe game eventually got under way on 26 March 1856. The Victorians, stung by criticism over the \u00a31000 stake, argued over just about everything; the toss, who should bat first, whether different pitches should be used for the different innings and even what the umpires should wear.\n\nVictoria won the toss but New South Wales captain George Gilbert successfully argued that the visiting team should decide who bats first. The MCG was a grassless desert and Gilbert, considering players fielded without boots, promptly sent Victoria into bat. Needing only 16 to win in the final innings, New South Wales collapsed to be 5 for 5 before Gilbert's batting saved the game and the visitors won by three wickets.<ref>{{cite web|title=Victoria vs. New South Wales, 1855\u201356|url=http://static.espncricinfo.com/db/ARCHIVE/1850S/1855-56/AUS_LOCAL/VIC_NSW_26-27MAR1856.html|website=[[ESPNcricinfo]]|publisher=[[ESPN Inc.]]|accessdate=22 November 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn subsequent years conditions at the MCG improved but the ever-ambitious Melburnians were always on the lookout for more than the usual diet of club and inter-colonial games. In 1861, [[Felix William Spiers]] and Christopher Pond, the proprietors of the Cafe de Paris in Bourke Street and caterers to the MCC, sent their agent, W.B. Mallam, to England to arrange for a cricket team to visit Australia.\n\nMallam found a team and, captained by Heathfield Stephenson, it arrived in Australia on Christmas Eve 1861 to be met by a crowd of more than 3000 people. The team was taken on a parade through the streets wearing white-trimmed hats with blue ribbons given to them for the occasion. Wherever they went they were mobbed and cheered by crowds to the point where the tour sponsors had to take them out of Melbourne so that they could train undisturbed.\n\nTheir first game was at the MCG on New Year's Day 1862, against a Victorian XVIII. The Englishmen also wore coloured sashes around their waists to identify each player and were presented with hats to shade them from the sun. Some estimates put the crowd at the MCG that day at 25,000. It must have been quite a picture with a new 6000 seat grandstand, coloured marquees ringing the ground and a carnival outside. Stephenson said that the ground was better than any in England. The Victorians however, were no match for the English at cricket and the visitors won by an innings and 96 runs.\n\n[[File:MCG-1864.JPG|thumb|1864 match between [[Victoria cricket team|Victoria]] and [[George Parr (cricketer)|George Parr]]'s [[English cricket team in Australia and New Zealand in 1863\u201364|touring All-England Eleven]]]]\nOver the four days of the 'test' more than 45,000 people attended and the profits for Speirs and Pond from this game alone was enough to fund the whole tour. At that time it was the largest number of people to ever watch a cricket match anywhere in the world. Local cricket authorities went out of their way to cater for the needs of the team and the sponsors. They provided grounds and sponsors booths without charge and let the sponsors keep the gate takings. The sponsors however, were not so generous in return. They quibbled with the Melbourne Cricket Club about paying \u00a3175 for damages to the MCG despite a prior arrangement to do so.\n\nThe last match of the tour was against a Victorian XXII at the MCG after which the English team planted an elm tree outside the ground.\n\nFollowing the success of this tour, a number of other English teams also visited in subsequent years. George Parr's side came out in 1863\u201364 and there were two tours by sides led by W.G. Grace. The fourth tour was led by James Lillywhite.\n\nOn Boxing Day 1866 an [[Indigenous Australian]] cricket team played at the MCG with 11,000 spectators against an MCC team. A few players in that match were in a [[1868 Aboriginal cricket tour of England|later team that toured England in 1868]]. Some also played in three other matches at the ground before 1869.\n\n===First Test match===\n[[File:Mcg 1878.jpg|thumb|The MCG in 1878. The first [[Test cricket]] match was played at the MCG in 1877]]\nUp until the fourth tour in 1877, led by [[James Lillywhite|Lillywhite]], touring teams had played [[first-class cricket|first-class]] games against the individual colonial sides, but Lillywhite felt that his side had done well enough against New South Wales to warrant a game against an All Australian team.\n\nWhen Lillywhite headed off to New Zealand he left Melbourne cricketer [[John Conway (cricketer)|John Conway]] to arrange the match for their return. Conway ignored the cricket associations in each colony and selected his own Australian team, negotiating directly with the players. Not only was the team he selected of doubtful representation but it was also probably not the strongest available as some players had declined to take part for various reasons. Demon bowler [[Fred Spofforth]] refused to play because wicket-keeper [[Billy Murdoch]] was not selected. Paceman [[Frank Allan]] was at Warnambool Agricultural Show and Australia's best all-rounder [[Edwin Evans (cricketer)|Edwin Evans]] could not get away from work. In the end only five Australian-born players were selected.\n\nThe same could be said for Lillywhite's team which, being selected from only four counties, meant that some of England's best players did not take part. In addition, the team had a rough voyage back across the [[Tasman Sea]] and many members had been seasick. The game was due to be played on 15 March, the day after their arrival, but most had not yet fully recovered. On top of that, wicket-keeper [[Ted Pooley]] was still in a New Zealand prison after a brawl in a [[Christchurch]] pub.\n\nEngland was nonetheless favourite to win the game and the first ever Test match began with a crowd of only 1000 watching. The Australians elected [[Dave Gregory (cricketer)|Dave Gregory]] from [[New South Wales cricket team|New South Wales]] as Australia's first ever captain and on winning the toss he decided to bat.\n\n[[Charles Bannerman]] scored an unbeaten 165 before retiring hurt. [[Sydney Cricket Ground]] curator, [[Ned Gregory]], playing in his one and only Test for Australia, scored Test cricket's first [[duck (cricket)|duck]]. Australia racked up 245 and 104 while England scored 196 and 108 giving Australia victory by 45 runs. The win hinged on Bannerman's century and a superb bowling performance by [[Tom Kendall]] who took 7 for 55 in England's second innings.\n\nA fortnight later there was a return game, although it was really more of a benefit for the English team. Australia included Spofforth, Murdoch and T.J.D. Cooper in the side but this time the honours went to England who won by four wickets.\n\nTwo years later [[George Harris, 4th Baron Harris|Lord Harris]] brought another England team out and during England's first innings in the Test at the MCG, Fred Spofforth took the first [[Hat-trick (cricket)|hat-trick]] in Test cricket. He bagged two hauls of 6 for 48 and 7 for 62 in Australia's ten wicket win.\n\n===Cricket uses===\nThrough most of the 20th century, the Melbourne Cricket Ground was one of the two major Test venues in Australia (along with the [[Sydney Cricket Ground]]), and it would host one or two Tests in each summer in which Tests were played; since 1982, the Melbourne Cricket Ground has hosted one Test match each summer. Until 1979, the ground almost always hosted its match or one of its matches over the New Year, with the first day's play falling somewhere between 29 December and 1 January; in most years since 1980 and every year since 1995, its test has begun on Boxing Day, and it is now a standard fixture in the Australian cricket calendar and is known as the [[Boxing Day Test]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/records/team/match_results.html?class=1;id=61;type=ground |title=Records / Melbourne Cricket Ground / Test matches / Match results |accessdate=30 August 2015 |publisher=ESPN Cricinfo |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161123192013/http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/records/team/match_results.html?class=1%3Bid%3D61%3Btype%3Dground |archivedate=23 November 2016 }}</ref> The venue also hosts one-day international matches each year, and Twenty20 international matches most years.

Victoria scored 1107 in two days, with [[Bill Ponsford]] scoring 352 and [[Jack Ryder (cricketer)|Jack Ryder]] scoring 295.\n\nOne of the most sensational incidents in Test cricket occurred at the MCG during the Melbourne test of the 1954\u201355 England tour of Australia. Big cracks had appeared in the pitch during a very hot Saturday's play and on the rest day Sunday, groundsman Jack House watered the pitch to close them up. This was illegal and the story was leaked by ''The Age'' newspaper. The teams agreed to finish the match and England won by 128 runs after [[Frank Tyson]] took 7 for 27 in the final innings.\n\nAn incident in the second Test of the 1960\u201361 series involved the [[West Indian cricket team|West Indies]] player [[Joe Solomon]] being given out after his hat fell on the stumps after being bowled at by [[Richie Benaud]]. The crowd sided with the West Indies over the Australians.\n\nNot only was the first Test match played at the MCG, the first [[One Day International]] match was also played there, on 5 January 1971, between Australia and England. The match was played on what was originally scheduled to have been the fifth day of a Test match, but the Test was abandoned after the first three days were washed out.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/150244.html|title=Washout|accessdate=30 August 2015|publisher=ESPN Cricinfo}}</ref> Australia won the 40-over match by 5 wickets.

The match was the idea of former Australian bowler and MCC committee member Hans Ebeling who had been responsible for developing the cricket museum at the MCG. The match had everything. England's Derek Randall scored 174, Australia's Rod Marsh also got a century, Lillee took 11 wickets, and David Hookes, in his first test, smacked five fours in a row off England captain Tony Greig's bowling. Rick McCosker who opened for Australia suffered a fractured jaw after being hit by a sharply rising delivery. He left the field but came back in the second innings with his head swathed in bandages. Australia won the match by 45 runs, exactly the same margin as the first Test in 1877.\n\n[[File:MCG stands.jpg|thumb|left|The second day of the 2006 Boxing Day Test match]]\nAnother incident occurred on 1 February 1981 at the end of a one-day match between Australia and New Zealand. New Zealand, batting second, needed six runs off the last ball of the day to tie the game. Australian captain, Greg Chappell instructed his brother Trevor, who was bowling the last over, to [[Underarm bowling incident of 1981|send the last ball down underarm]] to prevent the New Zealand batsman, Brian McKechnie, from hitting the ball for six. Although not entirely in the spirit of the game, an underarm delivery was quite legal, so long as the arm was kept straight. The Laws of cricket have since been changed to prevent such a thing happening again. The incident has long been a sore point between Australia and New Zealand.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}\n\nIn February and March 1985 the [[Benson & Hedges]] [[World Championship of Cricket]] was played at the MCG, a [[One Day International]] tournament involving all of the then Test match playing countries to celebrate 150 years of the Australian state of [[Victoria, Australia|Victoria]]. Some matches were also played at [[Sydney Cricket Ground]].\n\nThe MCG hosted the [[1992 Cricket World Cup]] Final between [[Pakistani cricket team|Pakistan]] and [[English cricket team|England]] with a crowd of more than 87,000. Pakistan won the match after an all-round performance by [[Wasim Akram]] who scored 33 runs and picked up 3 crucial wickets to make Pakistan cricket world champions for the first and as yet only time.\n\nDuring the 1995 Boxing Day Test at the MCG, Australian umpire [[Darrell Hair]] called [[Sri Lankan cricket team|Sri Lankan]] spin bowler [[Muttiah Muralitharan]] for throwing the ball, rather than bowling it, seven times during the match.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} The other umpires did not call him once and this caused a controversy, although he was later called for throwing by other umpires seven other times in different matches.\n\nThe MCG is known for its great atmosphere,{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} much of which is generated in the infamous [[Bay 13]], situated almost directly opposite to the members stand. In the late 1980s, the crowd at Bay 13 would often mimic the [[warming up|warm up]] [[Stretching#Stretching in preparation for a physical activity|stretches]] performed by [[Merv Hughes]]. In a 1999 One-Day International, the behaviour of Bay 13 was so bad that [[Shane Warne]], donning a helmet for protection, had to enter the ground from his dressing rooms and tell the crowd to settle down at the request of opposing England captain [[Alec Stewart]].\n\n[[File:Cricket World Cup Final (16351625604).jpg|thumb|MCG during the [[2015 Cricket World Cup Final]] with 93,013 in attendance]]\nThe MCG hosted three pool games as part of the [[2015 ICC Cricket World Cup]] as well as a quarter-final, and then the final on 29 March.

Spectator numbers for football are larger than for any other sport in Australia, and it makes more money for the MCG than any of the other sports played there.\n\nAlthough the Melbourne Cricket Club members were instrumental in founding Australian Rules Football, there were understandable concerns in the early days about the damage that might be done to the playing surface if football was allowed to be played at the MCG. Therefore, football games were often played in the parklands next to the cricket ground, and this was the case for the first documented football match to be played at the ground. The match which today is considered to be the first Australian rules football, played between [[Melbourne Grammar]] and [[Scotch College Melbourne|Scotch College]] over three Saturdays beginning 7 August 1858 was played in this area.\n\nIt wasn't until 1869 that football was played on the MCG proper, a trial game involving a police team. It was not for another ten years, in 1879, after the formation of the Victorian Football Association, that the first official match was played on the MCG and the cricket ground itself became a regular venue for football. Two night matches were played on the ground during the year under the newly invented [[electric light]].<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=The Argus|publication-place=Melbourne, VIC|title=Football by electric light|page=7|date=14 August 1879}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|newspaper=The Australasian|publication-place=Melbourne, VIC|title=Football Gossip|author=Peter Pindar|date=16 August 1879|page=204|issue=698|volume=XXVII}}</ref>\n\nIn the early years, the MCG was the home ground of [[Melbourne Football Club]], Australia's oldest club, established in 1858 by the founder of the game itself, Thomas Wills. Melbourne won five premierships during the 1870s using the MCG as its home ground.\n\nThe first of nearly 3000 [[Australian Football League|Victorian Football League/Australian Football League]] games to be played at the MCG was on 15 May 1897, with {{AFL Mel}} beating {{AFL Gee}} 64 to 19.\n\nSeveral Australian Football League (AFL) clubs later joined Melbourne in using the MCG as their home ground for matches: {{AFL Ric}} (1965), {{AFL NM}} (1985), {{AFL Ess}} (1992), {{AFL Col}} (started moving in 1994, became a full-time tenant in 2000) and {{AFL Haw}} (2000).

All three grand final replays have been played at the MCG.\n\n[[File:Mcg football.jpg|thumb|A sold out MCG during the [[2007 AFL Grand Final]]]]\nBefore the MCG was fully seated, a grand final could draw attendances above 110,000. The record for the highest attendance in the history of the sport was set in the [[1970 VFL Grand Final]], with 121,696 in attendance.\n\nSince being fully seated, grand final attendances are typically between 95,000 and 100,000, with the record of 100,022 in the 2018 grand final, followed by 100,021 at the [[2017 AFL Grand Final]].\n\nIn the modern era, most finals games held in Melbourne have been played at the MCG. Under the current contract, 10 finals (excluding the grand final) must be played at the MCG over a five-year period. Under previous contracts, the MCG was entitled to host at least one match in each week of the finals, which on several occasions required non-Victorian clubs to play \"home\" finals in Victoria. In 2018, the AFL, [[Government of Victoria|Victorian Government]] and Melbourne Cricket Club (MCC) announced that the MCG would continue to host the grand final until at least 2057.<ref name=\"MCG2057\">{{cite web|url=http://www.afl.com.au/news/2018-04-12/gf-at-mcg-until-2057-as-part-of-500m-megadeal|title=Grand Final at MCG until 2057 as part of $500m mega-deal|work=AFL.com.au|date=12 April 2018}}</ref>\n\nAll Melbourne-based teams (and most of the time Geelong) play their \"home\" finals at the MCG unless if four Victorian teams win the right to host a final in the first week of the finals.\n\n===MCG and the VFL/AFL===\nFor many years the VFL had an uneasy relationship with the MCG trustees and the Melbourne Cricket Club. Both needed the other, but resented the dependence. The VFL made the first move which brought things to a head by beginning the development of [[VFL Park]] at [[Mulgrave, Victoria|Mulgrave]] in the 1960s as its own home ground and as a potential venue for future grand finals. Then in 1983, president of the VFL, [[Allen Aylett]] started to pressure the MCG Trust to give the VFL a greater share of the money it made from using the ground for football.\n\nIn March 1983 the MCG trustees met to consider a submission from Aylett. Aylett said he wanted the Melbourne Cricket Club's share of revenue cut from 15 per cent to 10 per cent. He threatened to take the following day's opening game of the season, Collingwood vs Melbourne, away from the MCG. The money was held aside until an agreement could be reached.\n\nDifferent deals, half deals and possible deals were done over the years, with the [[Premier of Victoria]], [[John Cain II|John Cain, Jr.]], even becoming involved. Cain was said to have promised the VFL it could use the MCG for six months of the year and then hand it back to the MCC, but this never eventuated, as the MCG Trust did not approve it. In the mid-1980s, a deal was done where the VFL was given its own members area in the Southern Stand.\n\nAgainst this background of political manoeuvring, in 1985 {{AFL NM}} became the third club to make the MCG its home ground. In the same year, North played in the first night football match at the MCG for almost 110 years, against Collingwood on 29 March 1985.\n\nIn 1986, only a month after [[Ross Oakley]] had taken over as VFL Commissioner, VFL executives met with the MCC and took a big step towards resolving their differences. Changes in the personnel at the MCC also helped. In 1983 [[John Lill (cricketer)|John Lill]] was appointed secretary and [[Don Cordner]] its president.\n\nShortly after the Southern Stand opened in 1992, the Australian Football League moved its headquarters into the complex. The AFL assisted with financing the new stand and came to an agreement that ensures at least 45 AFL games are played at the MCG each year, including the Grand Final in September. Another 45 days of cricket are also played there each year and more than 3.5&nbsp;million spectators come to watch every year.\n\nAs of the end of 2011, [[Matthew Richardson (Australian rules footballer)|Matthew Richardson]] holds the records for having scored the most goals on the MCG and [[Kevin Bartlett (Aussie Rules footballer)|Kevin Bartlett]] holds the record for playing the most matches. Two players have scored 14 goals for an AFL or VFL game in one match at the MCG, [[Gary Ablett, Sr.]] in 1989 and 1993 and [[John Longmire]] in 1990.\n\nBefore an AFL match between {{AFL Ric}} and {{AFL Car}} on 27 August 1999, the city end scoreboard caught on fire due to an electrical fault, causing the start of play to be delayed by half an hour.\n\n{{wide image|MCG Panorama.JPG|1000px|align-cap=center|A panoramic view of the Melbourne Cricket Ground from level 4 of the Northern Stand, First game of the 2010 AFL Season between Richmond and Carlton}}\n\n==World War II==\nDuring [[World War II]], the government requisitioned the MCG for military use. From 1942 until 1945 it was occupied by (in order): the [[United States Army Air Forces]], the [[Royal Australian Air Force]], the [[United States Marine Corps]] and again the RAAF.<ref name=MCGCite>{{cite web|url=http://www.mcg.org.au/History/Other%20Events/US%20Marines.aspx |title=Melbourne Cricket Ground \u2013 US Marines at the MCG |accessdate=10 December 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131218084312/https://www.mcg.org.au/History/Other%20Events/US%20Marines.aspx |archivedate=18 December 2013}}</ref> Over the course of the war, more than 200,000 personnel were barracked at the MCG. From April to October 1942, the US Army's [[Fifth Air Force]] occupied the ground, naming it \"Camp Murphy\", in honor of officer Colonel William Murphy, a senior USAAF officer killed in [[Java]]. In 1943 the MCG was home to the legendary [[1st Marine Regiment (United States)|First Regiment]] of the [[1st Marine Division (United States)|First Division]] of the United States Marine Corps. The First Marine Division were the heroes of the [[battle of Guadalcanal|Guadalcanal campaign]] and used the \"cricket grounds\", as the marines referred to it, to rest and recuperate.<ref name = MCGCite/> On 14 March 1943 the marines hosted a giant \"get together\" of American and Australian troops on the arena.<ref name = MCGCite/>\n\nIn 1977, Melbourne Cricket Club president [[Albert Chadwick|Sir Albert Chadwick]] and [[Medal of Honor]] recipient, Colonel [[Mitchell Paige]], unveiled a commemorative plaque recognizing the Americans' time at the ground.<ref name = MCGCite/>\n\nIn episode 3 of the 2010 TV miniseries, ''[[The Pacific (TV miniseries)|The Pacific]]'', members of the US Marines are shown to be camped in the war-era MCG.\n\n==Olympic Games==\n{{Main|1956 Summer Olympics}}\n\nThe MCG's most famous moment in history was as the main stadium for the 1956 Olympic Games, hosting the opening and closing ceremonies, track and field events, and the finals in field hockey and soccer.<ref>[http://www.la84foundation.org/6oic/OfficialReports/1956/OR1956.pdf 1956 Summer Olympics official report.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080912181829/http://www.la84foundation.org/6oic/OfficialReports/1956/OR1956.pdf |date=12 September 2008 }} p. 40.</ref> The MCG was only one of seven possible venues, including the Melbourne Showgrounds, for the Games' main arena. The MCG was the Federal Government's preferred venue but there was resistance from the MCC. The inability to decide on the central venue nearly caused the Games to be moved from Melbourne. Prime Minister [[Robert Menzies]] recognised the potential embarrassment to Australia if this happened and organised a three-day summit meeting to thrash things out. Attending was Victorian Premier [[John Cain (senior)|John Cain, Sr.]], the Prime Minister, deputy opposition leader [[Arthur Calwell]], all State political leaders, civic leaders, Olympic officials and trustees and officials of the MCC. Convening the meeting was no small effort considering the calibre of those attending and that many of the sports officials were only part-time amateurs.\n\nAs 22 November, the date of the opening ceremony, drew closer, Melbourne was gripped ever more tightly by Olympic fever. At 3&nbsp;pm the day before the opening ceremony, people began to line up outside the MCG gates. That night the city was paralysed by a quarter of a million people who had come to celebrate.\n\nThe MCG's capacity was increased by the new Olympic (or Northern) Stand, and on the day itself 103,000 people filled the stadium to capacity. A young up and coming distance runner was chosen to carry the Olympic torch into the stadium for the opening ceremony.\n\nAlthough [[Ron Clarke]] had a number of junior world records for distances of 1500&nbsp;m, one mile (1.6&nbsp;km) and two miles (3&nbsp;km), he was relatively unknown in 1956. Perhaps the opportunity to carry the torch inspired him because he went on to have a career of exceptional brilliance and was without doubt the most outstanding runner of his day. At one stage he held the world record for every distance from two miles (3&nbsp;km) to 20&nbsp;km. His few failures came in Olympic and Commonwealth Games competition. Although favourite for the gold at Tokyo in 1964 he was placed ninth in the 5,000&nbsp;metres race and the marathon and third in the 10,000&nbsp;metres. He lost again in the [[1966 Commonwealth Games]] and in 1968 at altitude in Mexico he collapsed at the end of the 10&nbsp;km race.\n\nOn that famous day in Melbourne in 1956 the torch spluttered and sparked, showering Clarke with hot magnesium, burning holes in his shirt. When he dipped the torch into the cauldron it burst into flame singeing him further. In the centre of the ground, John Landy, the fastest miler in the world, took the Olympic oath and sculler Merv Wood carried the Australian flag.\n\nThe Melbourne Games also saw the high point of Australian female sprinting with [[Betty Cuthbert]] winning three gold medals at the MCG. She won the 100&nbsp;m and 200&nbsp;m and anchored the winning 4 x 100&nbsp;m team. Born in Merrylands in Sydney's west she was a champion schoolgirl athlete and had already broken the world record for the 200&nbsp;m just before the 1956 Games. She was to be overshadowed by her Western Suburbs club member, the [[Marlene Matthews]]. When they got to the Games, Matthews was the overwhelming favourite especially for the 100&nbsp;m a distance over which Cuthbert had beaten her just once.\n\nBoth Matthews and Cuthbert won their heats with Matthews setting an Olympic record of 11.5&nbsp;seconds in hers. Cuthbert broke that record in the following heat with a time of 11.4&nbsp;seconds. The world record of 11.3 was held by another Australian, Shirley Strickland who was eliminated in her heat. In the final Matthews felt she got a bad start and was last at the 50&nbsp;metre mark. Cuthbert sensed Isabella Daniels from the USA close behind her and pulled out a little extra to win Australia's first gold at the Games in a time of 11.5&nbsp;seconds, Matthews was third. The result was repeated in the 200&nbsp;m final. Cuthbert won her second gold breaking Marjorie Jackson's Olympic record. Mathews was third again.\n\nBy the time the 1956 Olympics came around, [[Shirley Strickland]] was a mother of 31 years of age but managed to defend her 80&nbsp;m title, which she had won in Helsinki four years before, winning gold and setting a new Olympic record.\n\nThe sensational incident of the track events was the non-selection of Marlene Matthews in the 4 x 100&nbsp;m relay. Matthews trained with the relay team up until the selection was made but Cuthbert, Strickland, Fleur Mellor and Norma Croker were picked for the team. There was outrage at the selection which increased when Matthews went on to run third in both the 100&nbsp;m and 200&nbsp;m finals. Personally she was devastated and felt that she had been overlooked for her poor baton change. Strickland was disappointed with the way Matthews was treated and maintained it was an opinion held in New South Wales that she had baton problems. One of the selectors, Doris Magee from NSW, said that selecting Matthews increased the risk of disqualification at the change. But Cuthbert maintained that the selectors made the right choice saying that Fleur Mellor was fresh, a specialist relay runner and was better around the curves than Matthews.\n\nThe men did not fare so well. The 4 x 400&nbsp;m relay team, including later IOC Committee member Kevan Gosper, won silver. Charles Porter also won silver in the high jump. Hec Hogan won bronze in the 100&nbsp;m to become the first Australian man to win a medal in a sprint since the turn of the century and despite injury John Landy won bronze in the 1500&nbsp;m. Allan Lawrence won bronze in the 10,000&nbsp;m event.\n\nApart from athletics, the stadium was also used for the soccer finals, the hockey finals, the Opening and Closing Ceremonies, and an exhibition game of baseball between the Australian National Team and a US armed services team at which an estimated crowd of 114,000 attended. This was the [[Guinness World Record]] for the largest attendance for any baseball game, which stood until a 29 March 2008 exhibition game between the [[Boston Red Sox]] and [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] at the [[Los Angeles Coliseum]] (also a former Olympic venue in [[1932 Summer Olympics|1932]] and [[1984 Summer Olympics|1984]]) drawing 115,300.\n\nThe MCG was also used for another demonstration sport, Australian Rules. The Olympics being an amateur competition meant that only amateurs could play in the demonstration game. A combined team of amateurs from the VFL and VFA were selected to play a state team from the Victorian Amateur Football Association (VAFA). The game was played 7 December 1956 with the VAFA side, wearing white jumpers, green collars and the Olympic rings on their chests, winning easily 81 to 55. One of the players chosen for the VFA side was [[Lindsay Gaze]] (although he never got off the bench) who would go on to make his mark in another sport, [[basketball]], rather than Australian Rules.\n\nThe MCG's link with its Olympic past continues to this day. Within its walls is the IOC-endorsed [[Australian Gallery of Sport and Olympic Museum]].\n\nForty-four years later at the [[2000 Summer Olympics]] in Sydney, the ground hosted several [[Football at the 2000 Summer Olympics|soccer]] preliminaries, making it one of a few venues ever used for more than one Olympics.<ref>[http://www.la84foundation.org/6oic/OfficialReports/2000/2000v1.pdf 2000 Summer Olympics official report.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20001109071400/http://www.olympics.com/eng/ |date=9 November 2000 }} Volume 1. p. 393.</ref>\n\n==Commonwealth Games==\n{{Main|2006 Commonwealth Games}}{{See also|Athletics at the 2006 Commonwealth Games}}\n[[File:MSC, 2006 Commonwealth Games.jpg|thumb|Mellbourne Cricket Ground during the [[2006 Commonwealth Games]]]]\nThe [[2006 Commonwealth Games opening ceremony|Opening]] and [[2006 Commonwealth Games closing ceremony|Closing]] Ceremonies of the [[2006 Commonwealth Games]] were held at the MCG, as well as athletics events during the games. The games began on 15 March and ended on 26 March.\n\nThe seating capacity of the stadium during the games was 80,000. A total of 47 events were contested, of which 24 by male and 23 by female athletes. Furthermore, three men's and three women's [[Disabled sports|disability events]] were held within the programme. All athletics events took place within the Melbourne Cricket Ground, while the [[marathon]] and [[racewalking]] events took place on the streets of [[Melbourne]] and finished at the main stadium.\n\nThe hosts Australia easily won the medals table with 16 golds and 41 medals in total. Jamaica came second with 10 golds and 22 medals, while [[Kenya]] and [[England]] were the next best performers. A total of eleven [[List of Commonwealth Games records in athletics|Games records]] were broken over the course of the seven-day competition. Six of the records were broken by Australian athletes.\n\n==Rugby union==\nThe first game of Rugby Union to be played on the ground was on Saturday, 29 June 1878, when the Waratah Club of Sydney played Carlton Football Club in a return of the previous year's contests in Sydney where the clubs had competed in both codes of football. The match, watched by a crowd of between 6,000 and 7,000 resulted in a draw; one goal and one try being awarded to each team.<ref>The Argus (Melbourne) 1 July 1878</ref><ref name=\"mcc-firstfootball\">{{cite book | url=http://www.mcc.org.au/~/media/Files/First%20Football%20Matches%20at%20the%20MCG.pdf | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130314164458/http://www.mcc.org.au/~/media/Files/First%20Football%20Matches%20at%20the%20MCG.pdf | url-status=dead | archive-date=2013-03-14 | title=The First Football Matches on the Melbourne Cricket Ground | publisher=The Melbourne Cricket Club Library | author=Batchelder, Alf | year=2002 | page=25 | isbn=0957807414}}</ref>\n\nThe next Rugby match was held on Wednesday 29 June 1881, when the Wanderers, a team organised under the auspices of the Melbourne Cricket Club, played a team representing a detached Royal Navy squadron then visiting Melbourne.
