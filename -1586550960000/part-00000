As of 2017, McAllen's population was estimated to be 143,433.<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\"/> It is the fifth-most populous metropolitan area ([[McAllen\u2013Edinburg\u2013Mission metropolitan area|McAllen\u2013Edinburg\u2013Mission]]) in the state of Texas, and the binational [[Reynosa\u2013McAllen metropolitan area]] counts a population of nearly 1.52 million.<ref>{{cite web |title=McAllen Overview |url=http://www.mcallen.org/Business-Community/McAllen-Overview |publisher=McAllen Chamber of Commerce |access-date=26 August 2011}}</ref>\n\nFrom its settlement in 1904, the area around McAllen was largely rural and agricultural in character, but the latter half of the 20th century had steady growth, which has continued in the 21st century in the metropolitan area. The introduction of the ''[[maquiladora]]'' economy and the [[North American Free Trade Association]] led to an increase in cross-border trading with Mexico.<ref>{{cite magazine |last= Bogan |first= Jesse |title= A Boom at the Border |magazine= Forbes |date= April 2, 2009 |url= https://www.forbes.com/2009/04/01/mexico-texas-economy-business-border.html |access-date= Nov 22, 2011}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{see also|Timeline of McAllen, Texas}}\nIn 1904, the Hidalgo and San Miguel Extension (now the Sam Fordyce Branch) of the [[St. Louis, Brownsville and Mexico Railway]] reached the Santa Anita Ranch. John McAllen and his son James had donated land to the railroad to guarantee it would cross this area. On December 5, 1904, the McAllen Townsite Company was formed by Uriah Lott, Leonidas C. Hill Sr., John McAllen, James Ball\u00ed McAllen, and John J. Young. The new community, which was named for John McAllen, had the depot nearest the county seat, [[Hidalgo, Texas|Hidalgo]], {{convert|8|mi|0|abbr=on}} to the south.\n\nBy 1911, {{convert|5000|acre|abbr=on}} were under cultivation in East McAllen: commodity crops of cotton, alfalfa, [[broom corn]], citrus fruits, grapes, and figs were raised. East McAllen had an estimated population of 1,000 that year, and West McAllen had ceased to exist. In 1911, the town applied for and was issued a charter of incorporation under the name McAllen. In 1916, 20,000 New York state troops were stationed at McAllen to help quell [[Border War (1910\u20131919)|border disturbances]] related to the Mexican Civil War. The resulting economic boom increased the population from 1,200 in 1916 to 6,000 in 1920.<ref>{{cite web |last= Garza |first= Alicia A. |title= McAllen |publisher= Handbook of Texas Online |url= https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/hdm01 |access-date= Nov 22, 2011}}</ref>\n\nMcAllen adopted a [[home rule]] charter in 1927. Canning factories, a winery, tortilla plants, wood-working plants, and some oil exploration increased the population to 9,074 by 1930. In 1936, Hiram Garner opened the Valley Distillery, Incorporated, which produced wines from citrus juices. The town was a petroleum and [[Chemurgy|farm chemurgic center]] with a population of 11,877 in 1940, by which time it had adopted the nickname \"The City of Palms\". In 1941, a [[suspension bridge]] replaced the old bridge from Hidalgo to Reynosa in [[Tamaulipas]]; the new toll bridge was purchased by McAllen and was named the [[McAllen\u2013Hidalgo\u2013Reynosa International Bridge]]. Its construction resulted in increased tourist trade, making McAllen a winter resort and port of entry to Mexico.\n\nThe discovery of oil in the Reynosa area in 1947 attracted a large migration of people from the Mexican interior to jobs the region. They both constituted a new tourist market and a cheap labor supply for McAllen. The sister cities were linked as a result of the increased traffic between them. The population of McAllen was 20,005 in 1950 and 32,728 in 1960. In 1954 the McAllen\u2013Hidalgo\u2013Reynosa International Bridge was the number-two port of entry into Mexico.<ref>{{cite web |title= McAllen-Hidalgo-Reynosa Bridge |publisher= Texas Department of Transportation |url= http://www.txdot.gov/project_information/projects/border_crossing/mcallen.htm |access-date= Nov 22, 2011}}</ref>\n\nMcAllen was an agricultural, oil, and tourist center in 1970, when the population reached 37,636. By the start of the 1970s, McAllen had a 200-bed hospital and a new air-conditioned high school, the first school in the nation featuring on-site power generated by [[natural gas]]-powered turbines. The tourism industry continued to expand as people traveled to the area from both Mexico and the northern United States. The population continued to grow steadily through the 1970s, and reached 66,281 by 1980. During the late 1980s, the McAllen Foreign Trade Zone was an important general-purpose [[foreign trade zone]].<ref>{{cite web |title= City History |publisher= City of McAllen |url= http://www.mcallen.net/info/history.aspx |access-date= Nov 22, 2011}}</ref> At the time, McAllen's main industries were retail, tourism and farming, and each was in trouble. The devaluation of the [[Mexican peso]] in the 1980s put a damper on cross-border shopping; local tourism was down because of the [[early 1980s recession|recession]]. In 1983, a freeze took out much of the valley's citrus crop.\n\nIn the mid-1980s, fueled by trade and the growth of the ''[[maquiladora]]'' (in which components are shipped to Mexico from the United States, assembled, and shipped back as finished products), the economy began to improve in Hidalgo County. McAllen sits across the border from Reynosa, a large manufacturing center. After the peso devalued, Mexico was more successful in attracting companies to run their plants in Mexico, with support operations in Texas.\n\nBorder crossing is a daily event for many and is a key component in the local economy.{{r|LAT 2019-03-21}} The city became a focal point for concerns about the border during the [[United States federal government shutdown of 2018\u20132019]] over the [[Mexico\u2013United States barrier]].

In the show, the overweight participant visits morbidly obese McAllen residents to find motivation for lifestyle and diet changes.\n\n==Economy==\nThe [[Rio Grande Valley]] began its rapid development with the introduction of [[irrigation]] in 1898 and the construction of the railroad in 1904. These major additions turned a once relatively desolate area into a major agricultural center. Throughout much of the 1900s, McAllen was a rural, agriculture-based economy characterized by sporadic growth.\n\nToday, the area is transforming into a major international trade area.

It is located at the southern tip of the state in the [[Rio Grande Valley]]. The city limits extend south to the [[Rio Grande]], across from the [[Mexico|Mexican]] city of [[Reynosa]]. McAllen is about {{convert|70|mi|km|abbr=on}} west of the [[Gulf of Mexico]]. As of 2017, McAllen's population was estimated to be 143,433.<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\"/> It is the fifth-most populous metropolitan area ([[McAllen\u2013Edinburg\u2013Mission metropolitan area|McAllen\u2013Edinburg\u2013Mission]]) in the state of Texas, and the binational [[Reynosa\u2013McAllen metropolitan area]] counts a population of nearly 1.52 million.<ref>{{cite web |title=McAllen Overview |url=http://www.mcallen.org/Business-Community/McAllen-Overview |publisher=McAllen Chamber of Commerce |access-date=26 August 2011}}</ref>\n\nFrom its settlement in 1904, the area around McAllen was largely rural and agricultural in character, but the latter half of the 20th century had steady growth, which has continued in the 21st century in the metropolitan area. The introduction of the ''[[maquiladora]]'' economy and the [[North American Free Trade Association]] led to an increase in cross-border trading with Mexico.<ref>{{cite magazine |last= Bogan |first= Jesse |title= A Boom at the Border |magazine= Forbes |date= April 2, 2009 |url= https://www.forbes.com/2009/04/01/mexico-texas-economy-business-border.html |access-date= Nov 22, 2011}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{see also|Timeline of McAllen, Texas}}\nIn 1904, the Hidalgo and San Miguel Extension (now the Sam Fordyce Branch) of the [[St. Louis, Brownsville and Mexico Railway]] reached the Santa Anita Ranch. John McAllen and his son James had donated land to the railroad to guarantee it would cross this area. On December 5, 1904, the McAllen Townsite Company was formed by Uriah Lott, Leonidas C. Hill Sr., John McAllen, James Ball\u00ed McAllen, and John J. Young. The new community, which was named for John McAllen, had the depot nearest the county seat, [[Hidalgo, Texas|Hidalgo]], {{convert|8|mi|0|abbr=on}} to the south.\n\nBy 1911, {{convert|5000|acre|abbr=on}} were under cultivation in East McAllen: commodity crops of cotton, alfalfa, [[broom corn]], citrus fruits, grapes, and figs were raised. East McAllen had an estimated population of 1,000 that year, and West McAllen had ceased to exist. In 1911, the town applied for and was issued a charter of incorporation under the name McAllen. In 1916, 20,000 New York state troops were stationed at McAllen to help quell [[Border War (1910\u20131919)|border disturbances]] related to the Mexican Civil War. The resulting economic boom increased the population from 1,200 in 1916 to 6,000 in 1920.<ref>{{cite web |last= Garza |first= Alicia A. |title= McAllen |publisher= Handbook of Texas Online |url= https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/hdm01 |access-date= Nov 22, 2011}}</ref>\n\nMcAllen adopted a [[home rule]] charter in 1927. Canning factories, a winery, tortilla plants, wood-working plants, and some oil exploration increased the population to 9,074 by 1930. In 1936, Hiram Garner opened the Valley Distillery, Incorporated, which produced wines from citrus juices. The town was a petroleum and [[Chemurgy|farm chemurgic center]] with a population of 11,877 in 1940, by which time it had adopted the nickname \"The City of Palms\". In 1941, a [[suspension bridge]] replaced the old bridge from Hidalgo to Reynosa in [[Tamaulipas]]; the new toll bridge was purchased by McAllen and was named the [[McAllen\u2013Hidalgo\u2013Reynosa International Bridge]]. Its construction resulted in increased tourist trade, making McAllen a winter resort and port of entry to Mexico.\n\nThe discovery of oil in the Reynosa area in 1947 attracted a large migration of people from the Mexican interior to jobs the region. They both constituted a new tourist market and a cheap labor supply for McAllen. The sister cities were linked as a result of the increased traffic between them. The population of McAllen was 20,005 in 1950 and 32,728 in 1960. In 1954 the McAllen\u2013Hidalgo\u2013Reynosa International Bridge was the number-two port of entry into Mexico.<ref>{{cite web |title= McAllen-Hidalgo-Reynosa Bridge |publisher= Texas Department of Transportation |url= http://www.txdot.gov/project_information/projects/border_crossing/mcallen.htm |access-date= Nov 22, 2011}}</ref>\n\nMcAllen was an agricultural, oil, and tourist center in 1970, when the population reached 37,636. By the start of the 1970s, McAllen had a 200-bed hospital and a new air-conditioned high school, the first school in the nation featuring on-site power generated by [[natural gas]]-powered turbines. The tourism industry continued to expand as people traveled to the area from both Mexico and the northern United States. The population continued to grow steadily through the 1970s, and reached 66,281 by 1980. During the late 1980s, the McAllen Foreign Trade Zone was an important general-purpose [[foreign trade zone]].<ref>{{cite web |title= City History |publisher= City of McAllen |url= http://www.mcallen.net/info/history.aspx |access-date= Nov 22, 2011}}</ref> At the time, McAllen's main industries were retail, tourism and farming, and each was in trouble. The devaluation of the [[Mexican peso]] in the 1980s put a damper on cross-border shopping; local tourism was down because of the [[early 1980s recession|recession]]. In 1983, a freeze took out much of the valley's citrus crop.\n\nIn the mid-1980s, fueled by trade and the growth of the ''[[maquiladora]]'' (in which components are shipped to Mexico from the United States, assembled, and shipped back as finished products), the economy began to improve in Hidalgo County. McAllen sits across the border from Reynosa, a large manufacturing center. After the peso devalued, Mexico was more successful in attracting companies to run their plants in Mexico, with support operations in Texas.\n\nBorder crossing is a daily event for many and is a key component in the local economy.{{r|LAT 2019-03-21}} The city became a focal point for concerns about the border during the [[United States federal government shutdown of 2018\u20132019]] over the [[Mexico\u2013United States barrier]].

In the show, the overweight participant visits morbidly obese McAllen residents to find motivation for lifestyle and diet changes.\n\n==Economy==\nThe [[Rio Grande Valley]] began its rapid development with the introduction of [[irrigation]] in 1898 and the construction of the railroad in 1904. These major additions turned a once relatively desolate area into a major agricultural center. Throughout much of the 1900s, McAllen was a rural, agriculture-based economy characterized by sporadic growth.\n\nToday, the area is transforming into a major international trade area. As recently as 1990, McAllen's unemployment rate was at 22.6%. By the end of 2005, that figure had dropped to 7.7%.

{"title_page": "Undergraduate education", "text_new": "{{short description|Academic programs up to the level of a bachelor's degree}}\n{{short description|}}\n'''Undergraduate education''' is education conducted after [[secondary education]] and prior to [[postgraduate education]]. It typically includes all postsecondary programs up to the level of a [[bachelor's degree]]. For example, in the [[United States]], an entry-level university student is known as an undergraduate, while students of higher degrees are known as [[graduate students]]. In some other educational systems, undergraduate education is [[Higher education|postsecondary education]] up to the level of a [[master's degree]]; this is the case for some science courses in Britain and some medicine courses in Europe.\n\n==Programs==\n===Africa===\n====Nigerian system====\n{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2008}}\nIn [[Nigeria]], undergraduate degrees (excluding Medicine, Medical Laboratory Science, Nursing, Engineering, Law and Architecture) are four-year-based courses. Medicine (MBBS) and Architecture normally take six years to complete studies while Medical Laboratory Science, Nursing, Law and Engineering courses take five years to complete studies, usually, all six years are taken to improve their chances. Undergraduate nursing degrees or diplomas usually take two to four years and sometimes 5 years to complete, whereas graduate degrees are an additional two years or more.\n\n====South African system====\n{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2008}}\nThe South African system usually has a three-year undergraduate bachelor's degree, with two or three majors. (There are exceptions, such as the medical qualification (MBChB), which is six years.) A fourth year, known as an Honours year, is considered a post-graduate degree. It is usually course-driven, although may include a project or thesis.\n\n===Americas===\n====Brazilian system====\n{{See also|Universities and Higher Education in Brazil}}\n{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2008}}\n[[Brazil]] follows the major traits of the continental European system; free public schools are available from kindergarten up to postgraduation, both as a right established in Article 6, ''caput'' of the [[Brazilian Constitution]] and as a duty of the State in Article 208, Items I, IV and V, of the Brazilian Constitution.<ref name=\"Planalto\">{{cite web|url=http://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/constituicao/constituicao.htm |title=Constitui\u00e7\u00e3o |website=Planalto.gov.br |date= |accessdate=2017-07-06}}</ref> Students choose their specific course of studies before joining the university. Admission to university is obtained by means of a competitive entrance exam known as [[Vestibular]] (a concept somewhat similar to the ''[[Baccalaur\u00e9at]]'' in France). There's a new system, adopted by most federal universities, that uses the high school national examination ([[ENEM]]) result as part or a replacement of the Vestibular grade.<ref name=\"MEC\">{{cite web |url=http://portal.mec.gov.br/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=13318&Itemid=310 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-11-26 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121115081453/http://portal.mec.gov.br/index.php?Itemid=310&id=13318&option=com_content&view=article |archivedate=2012-11-15 }}\n</ref> Depending on the chosen course, upon graduating the student shall be granted: a technologist diploma, 3 years to complete, a [[bachelor's degree]]'s [[diplom]]a, which usually takes 4 or, in the case of [[Law]], [[Veterinary]], [[Geology]] and [[Engineering]], 5 years to complete; or a professional [[diplom]]a, which normally require 5 or, in the case of [[medicine]], 6 years to complete.\n\n====United States system====\nIn the [[United States]], ''undergraduate'' refers to a student who is studying for a bachelor's degree.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://yalecollege.yale.edu/ |title=Welcome &#124; Yale College |website=Yalecollege.yale.edu |date= |accessdate=2017-07-06}}</ref> The most common bachelor's degrees are Bachelor of Arts ([[Bachelor of Arts|BA or AB]]) and Bachelor of Science ([[Bachelor of Science|BS or SB]]), but other degrees such as Bachelor of Fine Arts ([[Bachelor of Fine Arts|BFA]]), Bachelor of Business Administration ([[Bachelor of Business Administration|BBA]]), Bachelor of Music ([[Bachelor of Music|BM]]), Bachelor of Social Work ([[Bachelor of Social Work|BSW]]), Bachelor of Engineering ([[Bachelor of Engineering|BE]]), Bachelor of Science in Nursing ([[Bachelor of Science in Nursing|BSN]]), and Bachelor of Architecture ([[Bachelor of Architecture|BArch]]) are also possible.\n\nUnlike in the British model, degrees in law and medicine are not offered at the undergraduate level and instead are completed at a graduate level after earning a bachelor's degree. Neither field specifies or prefers any undergraduate major, though medical schools require a set of courses that must be taken before enrollment.<ref>{{cite web |title=Admission Requirements |url=https://students-residents.aamc.org/applying-medical-school/article/admission-requirements/ |website=Association of American Medical Colleges |accessdate=12 January 2020}}</ref>\n\nStudents can also choose to attend a [[community college]] prior to further study at another college or university. In most states, community colleges are operated either by a division of the state university or by local special districts subject to guidance from a state agency. Community colleges award [[associate degree]]s of different types, some intended to prepare students to transfer to universities (e.g. Associate of Arts (AA), Associate of Science (AS)), and others intended to provide vocational skills and training for students wishing to enter into or advance in a profession. Those seeking to continue their education may transfer to a university after applying through a similar admissions process as those applying directly to the four-year institution called [[Articulation (education)|articulation]]. Some community colleges have automatic enrollment agreements with a local college or university, where the community college provides the first two years of study and the university provides the remaining years of study, sometimes all on one campus. The community colleges award associate degrees, while universities and colleges award the bachelor's. However, some community colleges, such as [[Brazosport College]] in [[Lake Jackson, Texas]] offer bachelor's degrees along with associate degrees.<ref>{{cite web|title=Brazosport College \u2013 Bachelor of Applied Technology (BAT) program|url=http://www.brazosport.edu/programs/BAT/Pages/default.aspx|publisher=Brazosport College|accessdate=14 June 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141029190844/http://www.brazosport.edu/programs/BAT/Pages/default.aspx|archivedate=29 October 2014}}</ref> Conversely, some universities such as the [[University of Delaware]] also award associate degrees.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.aap.udel.edu/ |title=University of Delaware Associate in Arts Program |publisher=[[University of Delaware]] |date=2017 |accessdate=November 3, 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Asia===\n====Hong Kong system====\n{{unreferenced section|date=April 2012}}\nIn [[Hong Kong]], the English system is followed. Students sit for the [[HKCEE|Certificate of Education examinations]] at around sixteen years of age, and the [[HKALE|Advanced-level, or A-level examinations]] at around eighteen, then follow by three years of undergraduate education, except for a few specific fields, such as medicine, nursing and law. This is due to be changed, with five-year secondary education and two-year [[matriculation examination]] combined and shortened to six years [[matriculation]], and undergraduate education lengthened to four years. Students may be able to receive [[Curriculum#Higher education|general education]] in their first years in universities, more akin to the North American system. The first batch of students under the new system will enter universities in 2012.\n\nAlternatives are undergraduate certificates or diplomas, with some equivalent to associate degree in educational level.\n\n====Indian system====\nIn [[India]] the Graduation system is classified into two parts: Undergraduation (UG) and Postgraduation (PG). It takes three or four years to complete an \"undergraduate\" degree. The three-year undergraduate programs are mostly in the fields of arts, commerce, science etc., and the four-year programs are mostly in the fields of technology, engineering, pharmaceutical sciences, agriculture etc. However, for medicine, law and architecture, the period has been five years.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://csecduac.in/viewtopic.php?t=1325 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-07-17 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721161211/http://csecduac.in/viewtopic.php?t=1325 |archivedate=2011-07-21 }}</ref> The possessor of the first UG is referred to as graduate and that of the PG degree as post-graduate.<ref name=\"Anand2014\">{{cite book|author=Dr. J.S.

The pre-primary or preparatory classes, called kachi (literally, unripe) or [[Nursery school]], were formally integrated into the education system in 1988.\n\n===Europe===\n====English, Welsh, and Northern Irish system====\n{{main|British undergraduate degree classification}}\nStudents in England, Wales and Northern Ireland may usually enter university from the age of eighteen, often having studied [[A-levels]] and thus having had thirteen to fifteen years of schooling. Occasionally students who finish A Level or equivalent qualifications early (after skipping a year in school on the grounds of academic giftedness) may enter below this age but large universities are now setting minimum age limits of 16 or 17 after a number of well publicised \"child prodigies\" were found to be emotionally and mentally unprepared for university life.{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}\n\nApplications for undergraduate courses in UK higher education are made through the [[Universities and Colleges Admissions Service]] (UCAS).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ucas.com/about_us/whoweare |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-08-20 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080916053529/http://www.ucas.com/about_us/whoweare |archivedate=2008-09-16 }}</ref>\n\nFor their first degree, most students read for the degree of [[bachelor's degree|bachelor]], which usually takes three years, however in the sciences and engineering integrated courses covering both undergraduate level and advanced degree level leading to the degree of [[Master's degree in Europe#With Dissertation|master]],<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">{{cite web |url=http://www.qaa.ac.uk/academicinfrastructure/FHEQ/EWNI08/default.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-08-20 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080915114853/http://www.qaa.ac.uk/academicinfrastructure/FHEQ/EWNI08/default.asp |archivedate=2008-09-15 }}</ref> usually taking four years and including a research project or [[dissertation]] are popular. Given the integrated nature of these programs someone who gains a master's degree via an integrated program is not usually admitted to the degree of bachelor.\n\nMaster's degrees conferred after extended programs are not to be conflated with the degree of [[Oxbridge MA|Master of Arts conferred at Oxbridge and Dublin]], which is not a substantive qualification, but reflects the ancient practice of those three universities of promoting Bachelors of Arts to Masters of Arts (and thus full membership of the University) six or seven years after matriculation.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>\n\nHonours degrees and integrated master's degrees are awarded with [[British undergraduate degree classification|1st, upper 2nd, lower 2nd or 3rd class honours]]. If a student passes the course but fails to do so sufficiently well for third class honours to be awarded he will be awarded with an ordinary degree. It is possible to use the abbreviation \"Hons\" after the degree [[post nominal letters|postnominals]] to indicate that the degree has been passed with honours and is not an ordinary degree.\n\nMany universities offer [[sandwich course]]s or an extramural year, which offer work placements for a short period of time in a relevant industry before students complete their studies. Taking a sandwich course may make the course last a year longer than it would otherwise.\n\nWith [[Universities in the United Kingdom#Funding|very few exceptions]], nearly all universities with the power to award degrees are heavily state financed. However, they also rely on tuition fees set by the government at a maximum index-linked level, repayable after graduation contingent on attaining a certain level of income, and with the state paying all fees for students from the poorest backgrounds. UK students are generally entitled to student loans for maintenance with repayment contingent on income.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.studentfinancedirect.co.uk/portal/page?_pageid=53,1262207&_dad=portal&_schema=PORTAL |title=Student finance \u2013 GOV.UK |website=Studentfinancedirect.co.uk |date=2012-09-01 |accessdate=2017-07-06}}</ref> Unlike in other European countries, the British government does not own the universities' assets and university staff are not civil servants. United Kingdom universities are therefore better described as autonomous, intellectually-independent institutions with public funding, rather than public universities per se. The crown does not control syllabi, with the exception of teacher training.

Under the new Bologna reform, universities in Europe are introducing the Bachelor level (BA or BS) degree, often by dividing a 5-year Master-level program into two parts (3-year Bachelor's + 2-year Master's), where students are not obligated to continue with the second Master's-degree part. These new bachelor's degrees are similar in structure to British bachelor's degrees.\n\nIf there is a separate undergraduate degree, higher degrees (License, Master, Doctorat) can be gained after completing the undergraduate degree.

Because students are expected to have received a sound general education at the secondary level, in a school such as a [[gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]] or [[lycee]], students in Europe enroll in a specific course of studies they wish to pursue upon entry into a university. In the US, students only specialize in a \"major\" during the last years of college. Specializing in a field of study upon entry into a university means most students graduate after four to five years of study. The fields available include those only taught as graduate degrees in the US, such as [[law]] or [[medicine]].\n\nIn the traditional German system, there is a vocational degree ([[Diploma]] [[Fachhochschule|FH]]) that is similar in length, and is also considered an academic degree. Though it is designed as a specialist degree, in contrast to the Diplom degree at ''university'', which claims to be more generalist. Germany itself, however, is currently abolishing the legal distinction between [[Fachhochschule]] and university. They are both translated as university and they both provide bologna-compliant and equivalent postgraduate degrees.<ref>''L\u00e4ndergemeinsame Strukturvorgaben \u2013 Beschluss der Kultusministerkonferenz vom 10.10.2003 i.d.F. vom 15.06.2007''</ref>\n\nNot obligatory and sometimes applied at universities in the Netherlands are the [[Propaedeutics|propaedeutic]] exams. The entire curriculum of the first two semesters of the bachelor's programme is part of the propaedeutic exams. In most bachelor's studies, students are required to obtain their propaedeutic certificate within three semesters after starting the course. A propaedeutic certificate also counts as a requirement for participating in a university level bachelor's study. The propaedeutic exams have the purpose of assessing whether a student has the appropriate capacities in order to complete the course.\n\nAt some Swedish universities (such as the [[Royal Institute of Technology]]), PhD courses are sometimes referred to as \"graduate courses\", whereas courses for other students (up to master level) sometimes are referred to as \"undergraduate courses\".

It typically includes all postsecondary programs up to the level of a [[bachelor's degree]]. For example, in the [[United States]], an entry-level university student is known as an undergraduate, while students of higher degrees are known as [[graduate students]]. In some other educational systems, undergraduate education is [[Higher education|postsecondary education]] up to the level of a [[master's degree]]; this is the case for some science courses in Britain and some medicine courses in Europe.\n\n==Programs==\n===Africa===\n====Nigerian system====\n{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2008}}\nIn [[Nigeria]], undergraduate degrees (excluding Medicine, Medical Laboratory Science, Nursing, Engineering, Law and Architecture) are four-year-based courses. Medicine (MBBS) and Architecture normally take six years to complete studies while Medical Laboratory Science, Nursing, Law and Engineering courses take five years to complete studies, usually, all six years are taken to improve their chances. Undergraduate nursing degrees or diplomas usually take two to four years and sometimes 5 years to complete, whereas graduate degrees are an additional two years or more.\n\n====South African system====\n{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2008}}\nThe South African system usually has a three-year undergraduate bachelor's degree, with two or three majors. (There are exceptions, such as the medical qualification (MBChB), which is six years.) A fourth year, known as an Honours year, is considered a post-graduate degree. It is usually course-driven, although may include a project or thesis.\n\n===Americas===\n====Brazilian system====\n{{See also|Universities and Higher Education in Brazil}}\n{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2008}}\n[[Brazil]] follows the major traits of the continental European system; free public schools are available from kindergarten up to postgraduation, both as a right established in Article 6, ''caput'' of the [[Brazilian Constitution]] and as a duty of the State in Article 208, Items I, IV and V, of the Brazilian Constitution.<ref name=\"Planalto\">{{cite web|url=http://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/constituicao/constituicao.htm |title=Constitui\u00e7\u00e3o |website=Planalto.gov.br |date= |accessdate=2017-07-06}}</ref> Students choose their specific course of studies before joining the university. Admission to university is obtained by means of a competitive entrance exam known as [[Vestibular]] (a concept somewhat similar to the ''[[Baccalaur\u00e9at]]'' in France).

Neither field specifies or prefers any undergraduate major, though medical schools require a set of courses that must be taken before enrollment.<ref>{{cite web |title=Admission Requirements |url=https://students-residents.aamc.org/applying-medical-school/article/admission-requirements/ |website=Association of American Medical Colleges |accessdate=12 January 2020}}</ref>\n\nStudents can also choose to attend a [[community college]] prior to further study at another college or university. In most states, community colleges are operated either by a division of the state university or by local special districts subject to guidance from a state agency. Community colleges award [[associate degree]]s of different types, some intended to prepare students to transfer to universities (e.g. Associate of Arts (AA), Associate of Science (AS)), and others intended to provide vocational skills and training for students wishing to enter into or advance in a profession. Those seeking to continue their education may transfer to a university after applying through a similar admissions process as those applying directly to the four-year institution called [[Articulation (education)|articulation]]. Some community colleges have automatic enrollment agreements with a local college or university, where the community college provides the first two years of study and the university provides the remaining years of study, sometimes all on one campus. The community colleges award associate degrees, while universities and colleges award the bachelor's. However, some community colleges, such as [[Brazosport College]] in [[Lake Jackson, Texas]] offer bachelor's degrees along with associate degrees.<ref>{{cite web|title=Brazosport College \u2013 Bachelor of Applied Technology (BAT) program|url=http://www.brazosport.edu/programs/BAT/Pages/default.aspx|publisher=Brazosport College|accessdate=14 June 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141029190844/http://www.brazosport.edu/programs/BAT/Pages/default.aspx|archivedate=29 October 2014}}</ref> Conversely, some universities such as the [[University of Delaware]] also award associate degrees.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.aap.udel.edu/ |title=University of Delaware Associate in Arts Program |publisher=[[University of Delaware]] |date=2017 |accessdate=November 3, 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Asia===\n====Hong Kong system====\n{{unreferenced section|date=April 2012}}\nIn [[Hong Kong]], the English system is followed. Students sit for the [[HKCEE|Certificate of Education examinations]] at around sixteen years of age, and the [[HKALE|Advanced-level, or A-level examinations]] at around eighteen, then follow by three years of undergraduate education, except for a few specific fields, such as medicine, nursing and law. This is due to be changed, with five-year secondary education and two-year [[matriculation examination]] combined and shortened to six years [[matriculation]], and undergraduate education lengthened to four years. Students may be able to receive [[Curriculum#Higher education|general education]] in their first years in universities, more akin to the North American system. The first batch of students under the new system will enter universities in 2012.\n\nAlternatives are undergraduate certificates or diplomas, with some equivalent to associate degree in educational level.\n\n====Indian system====\nIn [[India]] the Graduation system is classified into two parts: Undergraduation (UG) and Postgraduation (PG). It takes three or four years to complete an \"undergraduate\" degree. The three-year undergraduate programs are mostly in the fields of arts, commerce, science etc., and the four-year programs are mostly in the fields of technology, engineering, pharmaceutical sciences, agriculture etc. However, for medicine, law and architecture, the period has been five years.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://csecduac.in/viewtopic.php?t=1325 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-07-17 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721161211/http://csecduac.in/viewtopic.php?t=1325 |archivedate=2011-07-21 }}</ref> The possessor of the first UG is referred to as graduate and that of the PG degree as post-graduate.<ref name=\"Anand2014\">{{cite book|author=Dr. J.S.

The pre-primary or preparatory classes, called kachi (literally, unripe) or [[Nursery school]], were formally integrated into the education system in 1988.\n\n===Europe===\n====English, Welsh, and Northern Irish system====\n{{main|British undergraduate degree classification}}\nStudents in England, Wales and Northern Ireland may usually enter university from the age of eighteen, often having studied [[A-levels]] and thus having had thirteen to fifteen years of schooling. Occasionally students who finish A Level or equivalent qualifications early (after skipping a year in school on the grounds of academic giftedness) may enter below this age but large universities are now setting minimum age limits of 16 or 17 after a number of well publicised \"child prodigies\" were found to be emotionally and mentally unprepared for university life.{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}\n\nApplications for undergraduate courses in UK higher education are made through the [[Universities and Colleges Admissions Service]] (UCAS).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ucas.com/about_us/whoweare |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-08-20 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080916053529/http://www.ucas.com/about_us/whoweare |archivedate=2008-09-16 }}</ref>\n\nFor their first degree, most students read for the degree of [[bachelor's degree|bachelor]], which usually takes three years, however in the sciences and engineering integrated courses covering both undergraduate level and advanced degree level leading to the degree of [[Master's degree in Europe#With Dissertation|master]],<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">{{cite web |url=http://www.qaa.ac.uk/academicinfrastructure/FHEQ/EWNI08/default.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-08-20 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080915114853/http://www.qaa.ac.uk/academicinfrastructure/FHEQ/EWNI08/default.asp |archivedate=2008-09-15 }}</ref> usually taking four years and including a research project or [[dissertation]] are popular.

If a student passes the course but fails to do so sufficiently well for third class honours to be awarded he will be awarded with an ordinary degree. It is possible to use the abbreviation \"Hons\" after the degree [[post nominal letters|postnominals]] to indicate that the degree has been passed with honours and is not an ordinary degree.\n\nMany universities offer [[sandwich course]]s or an extramural year, which offer work placements for a short period of time in a relevant industry before students complete their studies. Taking a sandwich course may make the course last a year longer than it would otherwise.\n\nWith [[Universities in the United Kingdom#Funding|very few exceptions]], nearly all universities with the power to award degrees are heavily state financed. However, they also rely on tuition fees set by the government at a maximum index-linked level, repayable after graduation contingent on attaining a certain level of income, and with the state paying all fees for students from the poorest backgrounds. UK students are generally entitled to student loans for maintenance with repayment contingent on income.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.studentfinancedirect.co.uk/portal/page?_pageid=53,1262207&_dad=portal&_schema=PORTAL |title=Student finance \u2013 GOV.UK |website=Studentfinancedirect.co.uk |date=2012-09-01 |accessdate=2017-07-06}}</ref> Unlike in other European countries, the British government does not own the universities' assets and university staff are not civil servants.
