By the middle Carboniferous, however, South China had already been in contact with North China long enough to allow floral exchange between the two continents. The Cimmerian blocks rifted from Gondwana in the Late Carboniferous.<ref name=\"Blakey-2003\" />\n\nIn the early Permian, the Neo-Tethys Ocean opened behind the Cimmerian terranes (Sibumasu, Qiantang, Lhasa) and, in the late Carboniferous, the Palaeo-Tethys Ocean closed in front. The eastern branch of the Palaeo-Tethys Ocean, however, remained opened while Siberia was added to Laurussia and Gondwana collided with Laurasia.<ref name=\"Zhao-etal2018-p14\" />\n\nWhen the eastern Palaeo-Tethys closed 250\u2013230&nbsp;Mya, a series of Asian blocks&nbsp;\u2013 Sibumasu, Indochina, South China, Qiantang, and Lhasa&nbsp;\u2013 formed a separate southern Asian continent.

As a result, two groups of [[Tribosphenida|tribosphenic mammals]] evolved separately on the newly formed landmasses: the [[Boreosphenida]] (marsupials and placentals) in Laurasia and the [[Australosphenida]] (monotremes and extinct relatives) in Gondwana.  The fossil record, however, suggests the intermittent presence of a Trans-Tethys land bridge, though the location and duration of such a land bridge remains enigmatic.<ref>{{Harvnb|Gheerbrant|Rage|2006|loc=Introduction, p. 225}}</ref>\n\n[[Pinaceae|Pine trees]] evolved in the early Mesozoic c. 250&nbsp;Mya and the [[List of Pinus species|pine genus]] originated in Laurasia in the Early Cretaceous c. 130&nbsp;Mya in competition with faster growing [[angiosperm|flowering plants]].  Pines adapted to cold and arid climates in environments were the growing season was shorter or wildfire common; this evolution limited pine range to between 31\u00b0 and 50\u00b0 north and resulted in a split into two subgenera: ''Strobus'' adapted to stressful environments and ''Pinus'' to fire-prone landscapes.  By the end of the Cretaceous pines were established across Laurasia, from North America to East Asia.<ref>{{Harvnb|Keeley|2012|loc=Introduction, pp. 445\u2013446; Mesozoic origin and diversification, pp. 450\u2013451}}</ref>\n\nFrom the Triassic to the Early Jurassic, before the break-up of Pangaea, [[archosaur]]s (crocodiles and dinosaurs including birds) had a global distribution.  This cosmopolitanism ended as Gondwana fragmented and Laurasia was assembled.  [[Pterosaur]] diversity reach a maximum in the Late Jurassic\u2014Early Cretaceous and plate tectonic didn't affect the distribution of these flying reptiles.  Crocodiles also diversified during the Early Cretaceous but were divided into Laurasian and Gondwanan populations; modern crocodiles evolved from the former.  The distribution of the three major groups of [[dinosaur]]s&nbsp;\u2013 the [[Theropoda|theropods]], [[Sauropoda|sauropods]], and [[Ornithischia|ornithischians]]&nbsp;\u2013 was similar that of the crocodiles.  East Asia remained isolated with endemic species including [[Psittacosaurus|psittacosaurs]] (horned dinosaurs) and [[Ankylosauridae]] (club-tailed, armoured dinosaurs).<ref> {{Harvnb|Milner|Milner|Evans|2000|p=319}}</ref>\n\nIn the early Eocene a peak in global warming led to a pan-Arctic fauna with alligators and amphibians present north of the Arctic Circle.  In the early Palaeogene, landbridges still connected continents, allowing land animals to migrate between them.  On the other hand, submerged areas occasionally divided continents: the [[Turgai Sea]] separated Europe and Asia from the Middle Jurassic to the Oligocene and as this sea or strait dried out, a massive faunal interchange took place and the resulting extinction event in Europe is known as the ''[[Grande Coupure]]''.<ref> {{Harvnb|Milner|Milner|Evans|2000|p=328}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Coraciiformes]] (an order of birds including kingfishers) evolved in Laurasia.

East Antarctica was the highest ground within Pangaea and produced sediments that were transported across eastern Gondwana but never reached Laurasia.  During the Palaeozoic, c. 30\u201340% of the Laurasia but only 10\u201320% of Gondwana was covered by shallow marine water.<ref>{{Harvnb|Rogers|Santosh|loc=Differences Between Gondwana and Laurasia in Pangea, pp. 127, 130}}</ref>\n\n===Asian blocks===\n{{Multiple image | total_width = 400 | align = right | perrow = 2\n | image1 = Geology of Asia 450.Ma.jpg\n | image2 = Geology of Asia 350Ma.jpg\n | image3 = Geology of Asia 300Ma.jpg\n | image4 = Geology of Asia 200Ma.jpg\n | footer = Journey of the Asian blocks from Gondwana to Laurasia 450, 350, 300, and 200 Mya.<br />View centred on 0\u00b0S,105\u00b0E.\n}}\nDuring the assembly of Pangaea Laurasia grew as continental blocks broke off Gondwana's northern margin; pulled by old closing oceans in front of them and pulled by new opening oceans behind them.<ref name=\"Zhao-etal2018-p14\">{{Harvnb|Zhao|Wang|Huang|Dong|2018||loc=Closure of Paleo-Tethys Ocean and assembly of Pangea with East Asian blocks, pp. 14-16}}</ref>\nDuring the Neoproterozoic-Early Paleozoic break-up of Rodinia the opening of the Proto-Tethys Ocean split the Asian blocks&nbsp;\u2013 Tarim, Qaidam, Alex, North China, and South China&nbsp;\u2013 from the northern shores of Gondwana (north of Australia in modern coordinates) and the closure of the same ocean reassembled them along the same shores 500\u2013460&nbsp;Mya resulting in Gondwana at its largest extent.<ref name=\"Zhao-etal-closure\" />\n\nThe break-up of Rodinia also resulted in the opening of the long-lived Paleo-Asian Ocean between Baltica and Siberia in the north and Tarim and North China in the south.

By the middle Carboniferous, however, South China had already been in contact with North China long enough to allow floral exchange between the two continents. The Cimmerian blocks rifted from Gondwana in the Late Carboniferous.<ref name=\"Blakey-2003\" />\n\nIn the early Permian, the Neo-Tethys Ocean opened behind the Cimmerian terranes (Sibumasu, Qiantang, Lhasa) and, in the late Carboniferous, the Palaeo-Tethys Ocean closed in front. The eastern branch of the Palaeo-Tethys Ocean, however, remained opened while Siberia was added to Laurussia and Gondwana collided with Laurasia.<ref name=\"Zhao-etal2018-p14\" />\n\nWhen the eastern Palaeo-Tethys closed 250\u2013230&nbsp;Mya, a series of Asian blocks&nbsp;\u2013 Sibumasu, Indochina, South China, Qiantang, and Lhasa&nbsp;\u2013 formed a separate southern Asian continent.

As a result, two groups of [[Tribosphenida|tribosphenic mammals]] evolved separately on the newly formed landmasses: the [[Boreosphenida]] (marsupials and placentals) in Laurasia and the [[Australosphenida]] (monotremes and extinct relatives) in Gondwana.  The fossil record, however, suggests the intermittent presence of a Trans-Tethys land bridge, though the location and duration of such a land bridge remains enigmatic.<ref>{{Harvnb|Gheerbrant|Rage|2006|loc=Introduction, p. 225}}</ref>\n\n[[Pinaceae|Pine trees]] evolved in the early Mesozoic c. 250&nbsp;Mya and the [[List of Pinus species|pine genus]] originated in Laurasia in the Early Cretaceous c. 130&nbsp;Mya in competition with faster growing [[angiosperm|flowering plants]].  Pines adapted to cold and arid climates in environments were the growing season was shorter or wildfire common; this evolution limited pine range to between 31\u00b0 and 50\u00b0 north and resulted in a split into two subgenera: ''Strobus'' adapted to stressful environments and ''Pinus'' to fire-prone landscapes.  By the end of the Cretaceous pines were established across Laurasia, from North America to East Asia.<ref>{{Harvnb|Keeley|2012|loc=Introduction, pp. 445\u2013446; Mesozoic origin and diversification, pp. 450\u2013451}}</ref>\n\nFrom the Triassic to the Early Jurassic, before the break-up of Pangaea, [[archosaur]]s (crocodiles and dinosaurs including birds) had a global distribution.  This cosmopolitanism ended as Gondwana fragmented and Laurasia was assembled.  [[Pterosaur]] diversity reach a maximum in the Late Jurassic\u2014Early Cretaceous and plate tectonic didn't affect the distribution of these flying reptiles.  Crocodiles also diversified during the Early Cretaceous but were divided into Laurasian and Gondwanan populations; modern crocodiles evolved from the former.  The distribution of the three major groups of [[dinosaur]]s&nbsp;\u2013 the [[Theropoda|theropods]], [[Sauropoda|sauropods]], and [[Ornithischia|ornithischians]]&nbsp;\u2013 was similar that of the crocodiles.  East Asia remained isolated with endemic species including [[Psittacosaurus|psittacosaurs]] (horned dinosaurs) and [[Ankylosauridae]] (club-tailed, armoured dinosaurs).<ref> {{Harvnb|Milner|Milner|Evans|2000|p=319}}</ref>\n\nIn the early Eocene a peak in global warming led to a pan-Arctic fauna with alligators and amphibians present north of the Arctic Circle.  In the early Palaeogene, landbridges still connected continents, allowing land animals to migrate between them.  On the other hand, submerged areas occasionally divided continents: the [[Turgai Sea]] separated Europe and Asia from the Middle Jurassic to the Oligocene and as this sea or strait dried out, a massive faunal interchange took place and the resulting extinction event in Europe is known as the ''[[Grande Coupure]]''.<ref> {{Harvnb|Milner|Milner|Evans|2000|p=328}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Coraciiformes]] (an order of birds including kingfishers) evolved in Laurasia.
