But, before going off with their husbands, the wives as well as their unmarried village sisters express their concern for and devotion to their brothers by placing young shoots of barley, the locally sacred grain, on the heads and ears of their brothers. (The brothers) reciprocate with small coins. On the same day, along with the ceremonies of Saluno, and according to the literary precedent of the [[Bhavishya_Purana#Uttaraparvan|Bhavisyottara Purana]], ... the ceremonies of Charm Tying (Rakhi Bandhan or Raksha Bandhan) are also held. The Brahman domestic priests of Kishan Garhi go to each patron and tie upon his wrist a charm in the form of a polychrome thread, bearing tassel \"plums.\" Each priest utters a vernacular blessing and is rewarded by his patron with cash, ... The ceremonies of both now exist side by side, as if they were two ends of a process of primary transformation.\"<ref name=\"MarriottBeals1955-Marriott-Saluno\" /></blockquote>\n\nNorwegian anthropologist, \u00d8yvind Jaer, who did his fieldwork in eastern UP in the 1990s noted that the \"great tradition\" festival was in retreat and the \"little tradition\" one, involving sisters and brothers, now more important.<ref name=\"Jaer1995\">{{citation|last=Jaer|first=\u00d8yvind|title=Karchana: lifeworld-ethnography of an Indian village|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HSESAQAAIAAJ|year=1995|publisher=Scandinavian University Press|isbn=978-82-00-21507-3|page=75}} Quote: '''Rakshabandhan''' (\"''charm tying''\"). This is another All-India related festival. The festival occurs ten days after Nag Panchami on the full moon (purnima) on the last day of the month of Savan (July/August). This festival marks, according to Hindu conceptions, the point of transition between the old and the new fasli, i.e. the agricultural year. This is emphasized by its popular name Salono, derived from the Persian Sal-i- nau - new year (Mukerji, 1918:91). Rakshabandhan also marks the transition from the rainy season to the autumn. Sisters will first take a ceremonial bath, make a rakhi (wristband of thread) and put it onto the hands of their brothers. In return, the brothers should give money and clothes. The performance of this sister-brother relationship is widespread in Karchana except among the Avarnas, where it is uncommon. The other part of the charm-tying festival is linked not to the family, but to the village community and the jajmani system. The Brahmin puruhit (family priest) will visit all his jajmans (clients) and put a rakhi onto their hands. In return, the jajmans will give sidha (gifts of flour or grain to Brahmins) and money to their family priest. As the jajmani system is in retreat, the family aspect is at present the most important part of the festival. </ref>\n\n==Precedence in Hindu texts==\nImportant in the Great Tradition is chapter 137 of the Uttara Parva of the ''[[Bhavishya Purana]]'',<ref name=\"MarriottBeals1955-Marriott-Saluno\" /> in which Lord [[Krishna]] describes to [[Yudhishthira]] the ritual of having a ''raksha'' (protection) tied to his right wrist by the royal priest (the [[purohit|rajpurohit]]) on the ''purnima'' (full moon day) of the Hindu lunar calendar month of Shravana).<ref name = BhavishyaPuranaChapter137/> In the crucial passage, Lord Krishna says, <blockquote> \"''Parth'' (applied to any of the three sons of [[Kunti]] (also, Pritha), in particular, Yudhishthira): When the sky is covered with clouds, and the earth dark with new, tender, grass, in that very Shravana month's full moon day, at the time of sunrise, according to remembered convention, a [[Brahmin]] should take a bath with perfectly pure water. He should also according to his ability, offer libations of water to the gods, to the paternal ancestors, as prescribed by the Vedas for the task required to be accomplished before the study of the Vedas, to the sages, and as directed by the gods carry out and bring to a satisfactory conclusion the ''shradh'' ceremony to honor the deceased. It is commended that a [[Shudra]] should also make a charitable offering, and take a bath accompanied by the ''mantras''. That very day, in the early afternoon (between noon and 3 PM) it is commended that a small parcel (bundle or packet) be prepared from a new cotton or silk cloth and adorned with whole grains of rice or barley, small mustard seeds, and red ocher powder, and made exceedingly wondrous, be placed in a suitable dish or receptacle. ... the ''purohit'' should bind this packet on the king's wrist with the words,'I am binding ''raksha'' (protection) to you with the same true words with which I bound ''[[Mahabali]]'' King of the [[Asura]]s. Always stay firm in resolve.' In \n the same manner as the king, after offering prayers to the Brahmins, the Brahmins, [[Kshatriya]]s, [[Vaishya]]s and Shudras should conclude their Raksha Bandhan ceremony.\"<ref name = BhavishyaPuranaChapter137>\n{{citation|url=https://archive.org/stream/BhavishyaPuranaWithHindiTranslationPart3BaburamUpadhyaya20032/Bhavishya%20Purana%20with%20Hindi%20Translation%20Part%203%20-%20Baburam%20Upadhyaya%202003%20%282%29#page/n531|title=Bhavisha Mahapuranam with Hindi translation, Part 3|last = Upadhyay|first = Baburam (translator)|publisher=Hindi Sahitya Sammelan|location=Allahabad|year = 2003|pages=516\u2013518}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Relation to territorial exogamy==\nOf special significance to married women, Raksha Bandhan is rooted in the practice of territorial or village [[exogamy]]\u2014in which a bride marries ''out'' of her natal village or town, and her parents, by custom, do not visit her in her married home.<ref name=\"Coleman2017\" /> Anthropologist Leo Coleman writes: <blockquote>Rakhi and its local performances in Kishan Garhi were part of a festival in which connections between out-marrying sisters and village-resident brothers were affirmed. In the \"traditional\" form of this rite, according to Marriott, sisters exchanged with their brothers to ensure their ability to have recourse\u2014at a crisis, or during childbearing\u2014to their natal village and their relatives there even after leaving for their husband's home. For their part, brothers engaging in these exchanges affirmed the otherwise hard-to-discern moral solidarity of the natal family, even after their sister's marriage.<ref name=\"Coleman2017\"/></blockquote>\n\nIn rural north India, where village exogamy is strongly prevalent, large numbers of married Hindu women travel back to their parents' homes every year for the ceremony.<ref name=\"Goody1990-exogamy-natal-home\" /> Scholar Linda Hess writes:<ref name=\"Hess2015\"/> Their brothers, who typically live with the parents or nearby, sometimes travel to their sisters' married home to escort them back. Many younger married women arrive a few weeks earlier at their natal homes and stay until the ceremony.<ref name=\"Wadley2005\" /> Folklorist Susan Wadley writes: <blockquote>\"In Savan, greenness abounds as the newly planted crops take root in the wet soil. It is a month of joy and gaiety, with swings hanging from tall trees. Girls and women swing high into the sky, singing their joy. The gaiety is all the more marked because women, especially the young ones, are expected to return to their natal homes for an annual visit during Savan.<ref name=\"Wadley2005\"/></blockquote> The brothers serve as lifelong intermediaries between their sisters' married- and parental homes,<ref name=\"Gnanambal1969\" /> as well as potential stewards of their security.\n\n==Urbanization, and mid-20th century transformations==\n<Center>\n{{Gallery\n|title=Journal entries of a newly-married, English-speaking, urban Indian woman around the time of Raksha Bandhan, August 1951. <br/> The Hindu lunar calendar dates are below the English ones.\n|align=center\n|width=160 |lines=4 \n|File:Raksha Bandhan journal1951b.jpg|Shopping, 13 August 1951 (Shravana, 11th day, waxing moon).

A few sisters in Kishan Garhi have taken to tying these ... charms of priestly type onto their brothers' wrists. The new string charms are also more convenient for mailing in letters to distant, city-dwelling brothers whom sisters cannot visit on the auspicious day. Beals reports, furthermore, that brothers in the electrified village of Namhalli near Bangalore tuned in to All India Radio in order to receive a time signal at the astrologically exact moment, and then tied such charms to their own wrists, with an accompaniment of broadcast Sanskrit mantras.\"<ref name=\"MarriottBeals1955-Marriott-Saluno\" /></blockquote>\n\nIn urban India, where families are increasingly [[nuclear family|nuclear]], and marriages not always traditional, the festival has become more symbolic, but continues to be highly popular. The rituals associated with these rites, however, have spread beyond their traditional regions and have been transformed through technology and migration,<ref name=\"Coleman2017-technology-migration2\">{{citation|last=Coleman|first=Leo|title=A Moral Technology: Electrification as Political Ritual in New Delhi|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6YDTDgAAQBAJ&pg=PT148|year=2017|publisher=Cornell University Press|isbn=978-1-5017-0791-9|page=148}}</ref> According to anthropologist, Leo Coleman: <blockquote> In modern rakhi, technologically mediated and performed with manufactured charms, migrating men are the medium by which the village women interact, vertically, with the cosmopolitan center\u2014the site of radio broadcasts, and the source of technological goods and national solidarity.<ref name=\"Coleman2017-technology-migration2\"/></blockquote> \n\nHindi movies have played a salient role.<ref name=\"Pandit 2003\">{{citation|last=Pandit |first=Vaijayanti|title=Business @ Home|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dSFDDAAAQBAJ&pg=PA234|year=2003|publisher=Vikas Publishing House|isbn=978-81-259-1218-7|page=234}}</ref> According to author Vaijayanti Pandit, <blockquote> Raksha Bandhan traditionally celebrated in North India has acquired greater importance due to Hindi films. Lightweight and decorative rakhis, which are easy to post, are needed in large quantities by the market to cater to brothers and sisters living in different parts of the country or abroad.\"<ref name=\"Pandit 2003\"/></blockquote> More social interaction among India's population has played a role in the increased celebration of this festival.<ref name=\"Khandekar2003\" /> According to author Renuka Khandekar: <blockquote> But since independence and the gradual opening up of Indian society, Raksha Bandhan as celebrated in North India has won the affection of many South Indian families. For this festival has the peculiar charm of renewing sibling bonds.\"<ref name=\"Khandekar2003\"/></blockquote>\n\nThe festival has also been promoted by Hindu political organizations.<ref name=\"JoshySeethi2015\" /> According to authors P. M. Joshy and K. M. Seethi. <blockquote> The RSS employs a cultural strategy to mobilise people through festivals. It observes six major festivals in a year. ... Till 20 years back, festivals like Raksha Bandhan' were unknown to South Indians. Through [[Sangh Shaka|Shakha]]'s intense campaign, now they have become popular in the southern India. In colleges and schools tying `Rakhi'\u2014the thread that is used in the 'Raksha Bandhan'\u2014has become a fashion and this has been popularised by the RSS and ABVP cadres.<ref name=\"JoshySeethi2015\" /></blockquote> \n\nSimilarly, according to author [[Christophe Jaffrelot]],<ref name=\"Jaffrelot1999\"/> <blockquote> This ceremony occurs in a cycle of six annual festivals which often coincides with those observed in Hindu society, and which Hedgewar inscribed in the ritual calendar of his movement: Varsha Pratipada (the Hindu new year), Shivajirajyarohonastava (the coronation of Shivaji), guru dakshina, Raksha Bandhan (a North Indian festival in which sisters tie ribbons round the wrists of their brothers to remind them of their duty as protectors, a ritual which the RSS has re-interpreted in such a way that the leader of the shakha ties a ribbon around the pole of the saffron flag, after which swayamsevaks carry out this ritual for one another as a mark of brotherhood),<ref name=\"Jaffrelot1999\"/></blockquote> Finally, the nation state in India has itself promoted this festival.<ref name=\"Coleman2017-technology-migration2\" /> as Leo Coleman states: <blockquote> ... as citizens become participants in the wider \"new traditions\" of the national state. Broadcast mantras become the emblems of a new level of state power and the means of the integration of villagers and city dwellers alike into a new community of citizens.<ref name=\"Coleman2017-nation-building\"/></blockquote>\n\nMore recently, after enactment of more gender-neutral inheritance laws in India, it has been suggested that in some communities the festival has seen a resurgence of celebration, which is serving to indirectly pressure women to abstain from fully claiming their inheritance.<ref name=\"NairJohn2000-NIndia\" /> According to author Prem Chowdhry, <blockquote> Rural patriarchal forces have been anxiously devising means to stem the progressive fallout of this [[Hindu_Succession_Act,_1956#In_the_case_of_females|Act]] through a variety of means. One way has been to oppose the inheritance rights of a daughter or a sister to those of the brother. Except in cases where there are no brothers, the sisters either sign away their in favour of their brother or sell it to him at a nominal price. This code of conduct is observed knowingly by both the natal and conjugal families. Brother-sister bonds of love have also been greatly encouraged, visible in the noticeable revival of the Raksha Bandhan festival and the renewed sanctity it has claimed in north India.<ref name=\"NairJohn2000-NIndia\" /></blockquote>\n\n==Voluntary kin relations==\n[[File:Dr Rajendra Prasad Rakhi 1953.jpg|right|thumb|260px|[[Rajendra Prasad]], the first president of the [[Republic of India]] celebrating Raksha Bandhan at the presidential palace, [[Rashtrapati Bhawan]], in [[New Delhi]], 24 August 1953]]\nAmong women and men who are not [[Consanguinity|blood relative]]s, there is also a transformed tradition of [[fictive kinship|voluntary kin]] relations, achieved through the tying of ''rakhi'' amulets, which have cut across caste and class lines,<ref name=\"HeitzmanWorden1996\" /> and Hindu and Muslim divisions.<ref name=\"MinesLamb2002\" /> In some communities or contexts, other figures, such as a matriarch, or a person in authority, can be included in the ceremony in ritual acknowledgement of their benefaction.<ref name=\"Chowdhry1994\" /> According to author Prem Chowdhry, \"The same symbolic protection is also requested from the high caste men by the low caste women in a work relationship situation.

Finally, saint Narada appears who persuades Ganesha that a daughter will enrich him as well as his sons. Ganesha agreed, and created a daughter named [[Santoshi Mata|Santoshi Maa]] by divine flames that emerged from Ganesh's wives, ''Riddhi'' (Amazing) and ''Siddhi'' (Perfection).

He was their ''malik'', their owner; they were more often ''dasis'' than ''patnis'' (wives). Yet Ganesha was married to them, albeit within a marriage different from other divine matches in the lack of a clear familial context. Such a context has recently emerged in the popular film ''Jai Santoshi Ma''. The film builds upon a text, also of recent vintage, in which Ganesha has a daughter, the neophyte goddess of satisfaction, Santoshi Ma. In the film, the role of Gane\u00a7a as family man is developed significantly. Santoshi Ma's genesis occurs on Raksha bandhan. Ganesha's sister is visiting for the tying of the rakhi. He calls her ''bahenmansa''\u2014his \"mind-born\" sister. Ganesha's wives, Rddhi and Siddhi, are also present, with their sons Subha and Labha. The boys are jealous, as they, unlike their father, have no sister with whom to tie the rakhi. They and the other women plead with their father, but to no avail; but then Narada appears and convinces Ganesha that the creation of an illustrious daughter will reflect much credit back onto himself. Ganesha assents and from Rddhi and Siddhi emerges a flame that engenders Santoshi Ma.</blockquote>\n\n===''Sikandar'' (1941 film)===\nFilm historian Arthur Pomeroy describes the manufacture of a modern and widespread Indian legend in the 1941 movie ''[[Sikandar (1941 film)|Sikandar]]'':<ref name=\"Pomeroy2017\">{{citation|last=Pomeroy|first=Arthur J.|title=A Companion to Ancient Greece and Rome on Screen|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3kwnDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT428|year=2017|publisher=Wiley|isbn=978-1-118-74144-3|page=428}}</ref> \n\n<blockquote>In ''Sikandar'' a very daring Roxane follows Alexander incognito to India and manages to gain admission to King Porus (in the Indian version: Puru), a conversation with a young, friendly Indian village woman named Surmaniya, Roxane learns about the Indian feast of Rakhi which is being celebrated at that very moment with the purpose of strengthening the bond between sister and brother (0:25\u20130:30). On this occasion, sisters tie a ribbon (i.e. rakhi) to their brothers' arms to symbolize their close relationships, and brothers offer presents and assistance in return. Besides, Roxane is also told that the relationship need not be one of consanguinity; every girl can choose a brother. Therefore, she decides to offer the rakhi to King Porus, who accepts the relationship after some hesitation, because he feels the need to apologize to Roxane, Darius's (a.k.a. Dara's) daughter, for not having helped her father when he asked for assistance against Alexander. As a result of their bond, he offers her gifts befitting her rank and promises not to harm Alexander (0:32\u201335). Later, when Porus comes into hand-to-hand combat with the Greek king, he stands by his promise and spares him (1:31). Interestingly, the rakhi episode with Porus is still to this day very popular in India and is cited as very early historical evidence for the origin of the authentic Hindu festival called Raksha Bandhan. Although examples of that legend can be traced in internet forums, Indian newspapers, a children's book and an educational video, I was not able to find its ancient origin.</blockquote>\n\n===Rani Karnavati and Emperor Humayun===\n{{Quote box\n|width     = 23em\n|border    = 1px\n|align     = right\n|bgcolor   =#D0F0F0\n|fontsize  = 85%\n|title_bg  =\n|title_fnt =\n|title     =\n|quote     = Bound by a sacred gift, in happier hours,<br/> To prove a brother's undecaying faith; <br/> Now when the star of Kurnivati lowers, <br/>He rushes on to danger or to death.<br/><br/> He came to the beleaguered walls too late,<br/>Vain was the splendid sacrifice to save; <br/>Famine and death were sitting at the gate, <br/>The flower of Rajasthan had found a grave.<ref name=\"Roberts1832\">{{citation|last=Roberts|first=Emma|title=Oriental Scenes, dramatic sketches and tales, with other poems|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=C6BgAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA125|year=1832|pages=125\u2013}}</ref><ref name=\"Fhlathuin2015\">{{citation|last=Fhlathuin|first=Maire ni|title=British India and Victorian Literary Culture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nKYkDQAAQBAJ&pg=PT174|year=2015|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|isbn=978-1-4744-0776-2|pages=174\u2013}}</ref>\n|salign    = right\n|source    =&nbsp;\u2014 From poem, \"The Rakhi,\" in ''Oriental scenes, dramatic sketches, and tales'' (1832), by [[Emma Roberts (author)|Emma Roberts]], p. 125 \n}}\nAnother controversial historical account is that of [[Rani Karnavati]] of [[Chittor]] and [[Mughal Emperor]] [[Humayun]], which dates to 1535 CE.

But, before going off with their husbands, the wives as well as their unmarried village sisters express their concern for and devotion to their brothers by placing young shoots of barley, the locally sacred grain, on the heads and ears of their brothers. (The brothers) reciprocate with small coins. On the same day, along with the ceremonies of Saluno, and according to the literary precedent of the [[Bhavishya_Purana#Uttaraparvan|Bhavisyottara Purana]], ... the ceremonies of Charm Tying (Rakhi Bandhan or Raksha Bandhan) are also held. The Brahman domestic priests of Kishan Garhi go to each patron and tie upon his wrist a charm in the form of a polychrome thread, bearing tassel \"plums.\" Each priest utters a vernacular blessing and is rewarded by his patron with cash, ... The ceremonies of both now exist side by side, as if they were two ends of a process of primary transformation.\"<ref name=\"MarriottBeals1955-Marriott-Saluno\" /></blockquote>\n\nNorwegian anthropologist, \u00d8yvind Jaer, who did his fieldwork in eastern UP in the 1990s noted that the \"great tradition\" festival was in retreat and the \"little tradition\" one, involving sisters and brothers, now more important.<ref name=\"Jaer1995\">{{citation|last=Jaer|first=\u00d8yvind|title=Karchana: lifeworld-ethnography of an Indian village|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HSESAQAAIAAJ|year=1995|publisher=Scandinavian University Press|isbn=978-82-00-21507-3|page=75}} Quote: '''Rakshabandhan''' (\"''charm tying''\"). This is another All-India related festival. The festival occurs ten days after Nag Panchami on the full moon (purnima) on the last day of the month of Savan (July/August). This festival marks, according to Hindu conceptions, the point of transition between the old and the new fasli, i.e. the agricultural year. This is emphasized by its popular name Salono, derived from the Persian Sal-i- nau - new year (Mukerji, 1918:91). Rakshabandhan also marks the transition from the rainy season to the autumn. Sisters will first take a ceremonial bath, make a rakhi (wristband of thread) and put it onto the hands of their brothers. In return, the brothers should give money and clothes. The performance of this sister-brother relationship is widespread in Karchana except among the Avarnas, where it is uncommon. The other part of the charm-tying festival is linked not to the family, but to the village community and the jajmani system. The Brahmin puruhit (family priest) will visit all his jajmans (clients) and put a rakhi onto their hands. In return, the jajmans will give sidha (gifts of flour or grain to Brahmins) and money to their family priest. As the jajmani system is in retreat, the family aspect is at present the most important part of the festival. </ref>\n\n==Precedence in Hindu texts==\nImportant in the Great Tradition is chapter 137 of the Uttara Parva of the ''[[Bhavishya Purana]]'',<ref name=\"MarriottBeals1955-Marriott-Saluno\" /> in which Lord [[Krishna]] describes to [[Yudhishthira]] the ritual of having a ''raksha'' (protection) tied to his right wrist by the royal priest (the [[purohit|rajpurohit]]) on the ''purnima'' (full moon day) of the Hindu lunar calendar month of Shravana).<ref name = BhavishyaPuranaChapter137/> In the crucial passage, Lord Krishna says, <blockquote> \"''Parth'' (applied to any of the three sons of [[Kunti]] (also, Pritha), in particular, Yudhishthira): When the sky is covered with clouds, and the earth dark with new, tender, grass, in that very Shravana month's full moon day, at the time of sunrise, according to remembered convention, a [[Brahmin]] should take a bath with perfectly pure water. He should also according to his ability, offer libations of water to the gods, to the paternal ancestors, as prescribed by the Vedas for the task required to be accomplished before the study of the Vedas, to the sages, and as directed by the gods carry out and bring to a satisfactory conclusion the ''shradh'' ceremony to honor the deceased. It is commended that a [[Shudra]] should also make a charitable offering, and take a bath accompanied by the ''mantras''. That very day, in the early afternoon (between noon and 3 PM) it is commended that a small parcel (bundle or packet) be prepared from a new cotton or silk cloth and adorned with whole grains of rice or barley, small mustard seeds, and red ocher powder, and made exceedingly wondrous, be placed in a suitable dish or receptacle. ... the ''purohit'' should bind this packet on the king's wrist with the words,'I am binding ''raksha'' (protection) to you with the same true words with which I bound ''[[Mahabali]]'' King of the [[Asura]]s. Always stay firm in resolve.'

In the \"traditional\" form of this rite, according to Marriott, sisters exchanged with their brothers to ensure their ability to have recourse\u2014at a crisis, or during childbearing\u2014to their natal village and their relatives there even after leaving for their husband's home. For their part, brothers engaging in these exchanges affirmed the otherwise hard-to-discern moral solidarity of the natal family, even after their sister's marriage.<ref name=\"Coleman2017\"/></blockquote>\n\nIn rural north India, where village exogamy is strongly prevalent, large numbers of married Hindu women travel back to their parents' homes every year for the ceremony.<ref name=\"Goody1990-exogamy-natal-home\" /> Scholar Linda Hess writes:<ref name=\"Hess2015\"/> Their brothers, who typically live with the parents or nearby, sometimes travel to their sisters' married home to escort them back. Many younger married women arrive a few weeks earlier at their natal homes and stay until the ceremony.<ref name=\"Wadley2005\" /> Folklorist Susan Wadley writes: <blockquote>\"In Savan, greenness abounds as the newly planted crops take root in the wet soil. It is a month of joy and gaiety, with swings hanging from tall trees. Girls and women swing high into the sky, singing their joy. The gaiety is all the more marked because women, especially the young ones, are expected to return to their natal homes for an annual visit during Savan.<ref name=\"Wadley2005\"/></blockquote> The brothers serve as lifelong intermediaries between their sisters' married- and parental homes,<ref name=\"Gnanambal1969\" /> as well as potential stewards of their security.\n\n==Urbanization, and mid-20th century transformations==\n<Center>\n{{Gallery\n|title=Journal entries of a newly-married, English-speaking, urban Indian woman around the time of Raksha Bandhan, August 1951. <br/> The Hindu lunar calendar dates are below the English ones.\n|align=center\n|width=160 |lines=4 \n|File:Raksha Bandhan journal1951b.jpg|Shopping, 13 August 1951 (Shravana, 11th day, waxing moon).

A few sisters in Kishan Garhi have taken to tying these ... charms of priestly type onto their brothers' wrists. The new string charms are also more convenient for mailing in letters to distant, city-dwelling brothers whom sisters cannot visit on the auspicious day. Beals reports, furthermore, that brothers in the electrified village of Namhalli near Bangalore tuned in to All India Radio in order to receive a time signal at the astrologically exact moment, and then tied such charms to their own wrists, with an accompaniment of broadcast Sanskrit mantras.\"<ref name=\"MarriottBeals1955-Marriott-Saluno\" /></blockquote>\n\nIn urban India, where families are increasingly [[nuclear family|nuclear]], and marriages not always traditional, the festival has become more symbolic, but continues to be highly popular. The rituals associated with these rites, however, have spread beyond their traditional regions and have been transformed through technology and migration,<ref name=\"Coleman2017-technology-migration2\">{{citation|last=Coleman|first=Leo|title=A Moral Technology: Electrification as Political Ritual in New Delhi|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6YDTDgAAQBAJ&pg=PT148|year=2017|publisher=Cornell University Press|isbn=978-1-5017-0791-9|page=148}}</ref> According to anthropologist, Leo Coleman: <blockquote> In modern rakhi, technologically mediated and performed with manufactured charms, migrating men are the medium by which the village women interact, vertically, with the cosmopolitan center\u2014the site of radio broadcasts, and the source of technological goods and national solidarity.<ref name=\"Coleman2017-technology-migration2\"/></blockquote> \n\nHindi movies have played a salient role.<ref name=\"Pandit 2003\">{{citation|last=Pandit |first=Vaijayanti|title=Business @ Home|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dSFDDAAAQBAJ&pg=PA234|year=2003|publisher=Vikas Publishing House|isbn=978-81-259-1218-7|page=234}}</ref> According to author Vaijayanti Pandit, <blockquote> Raksha Bandhan traditionally celebrated in North India has acquired greater importance due to Hindi films. Lightweight and decorative rakhis, which are easy to post, are needed in large quantities by the market to cater to brothers and sisters living in different parts of the country or abroad.\"<ref name=\"Pandit 2003\"/></blockquote> More social interaction among India's population has played a role in the increased celebration of this festival.<ref name=\"Khandekar2003\" /> According to author Renuka Khandekar: <blockquote> But since independence and the gradual opening up of Indian society, Raksha Bandhan as celebrated in North India has won the affection of many South Indian families. For this festival has the peculiar charm of renewing sibling bonds.\"<ref name=\"Khandekar2003\"/></blockquote>\n\nThe festival has also been promoted by Hindu political organizations.<ref name=\"JoshySeethi2015\" /> According to authors P. M. Joshy and K. M. Seethi. <blockquote> The RSS employs a cultural strategy to mobilise people through festivals. It observes six major festivals in a year. ... Till 20 years back, festivals like Raksha Bandhan' were unknown to South Indians. Through [[Sangh Shaka|Shakha]]'s intense campaign, now they have become popular in the southern India. In colleges and schools tying `Rakhi'\u2014the thread that is used in the 'Raksha Bandhan'\u2014has become a fashion and this has been popularised by the RSS and ABVP cadres.<ref name=\"JoshySeethi2015\" /></blockquote> \n\nSimilarly, according to author [[Christophe Jaffrelot]],<ref name=\"Jaffrelot1999\"/> <blockquote> This ceremony occurs in a cycle of six annual festivals which often coincides with those observed in Hindu society, and which Hedgewar inscribed in the ritual calendar of his movement: Varsha Pratipada (the Hindu new year), Shivajirajyarohonastava (the coronation of Shivaji), guru dakshina, Raksha Bandhan (a North Indian festival in which sisters tie ribbons round the wrists of their brothers to remind them of their duty as protectors, a ritual which the RSS has re-interpreted in such a way that the leader of the shakha ties a ribbon around the pole of the saffron flag, after which swayamsevaks carry out this ritual for one another as a mark of brotherhood),<ref name=\"Jaffrelot1999\"/></blockquote> Finally, the nation state in India has itself promoted this festival.<ref name=\"Coleman2017-technology-migration2\" /> as Leo Coleman states: <blockquote> ... as citizens become participants in the wider \"new traditions\" of the national state. Broadcast mantras become the emblems of a new level of state power and the means of the integration of villagers and city dwellers alike into a new community of citizens.<ref name=\"Coleman2017-nation-building\"/></blockquote>\n\nMore recently, after enactment of more gender-neutral inheritance laws in India, it has been suggested that in some communities the festival has seen a resurgence of celebration, which is serving to indirectly pressure women to abstain from fully claiming their inheritance.<ref name=\"NairJohn2000-NIndia\" /> According to author Prem Chowdhry, <blockquote> Rural patriarchal forces have been anxiously devising means to stem the progressive fallout of this [[Hindu_Succession_Act,_1956#In_the_case_of_females|Act]] through a variety of means. One way has been to oppose the inheritance rights of a daughter or a sister to those of the brother. Except in cases where there are no brothers, the sisters either sign away their in favour of their brother or sell it to him at a nominal price. This code of conduct is observed knowingly by both the natal and conjugal families. Brother-sister bonds of love have also been greatly encouraged, visible in the noticeable revival of the Raksha Bandhan festival and the renewed sanctity it has claimed in north India.<ref name=\"NairJohn2000-NIndia\" /></blockquote>\n\n==Voluntary kin relations==\n[[File:Dr Rajendra Prasad Rakhi 1953.jpg|right|thumb|260px|[[Rajendra Prasad]], the first president of the [[Republic of India]] celebrating Raksha Bandhan at the presidential palace, [[Rashtrapati Bhawan]], in [[New Delhi]], 24 August 1953]]\nAmong women and men who are not [[Consanguinity|blood relative]]s, there is also a transformed tradition of [[fictive kinship|voluntary kin]] relations, achieved through the tying of ''rakhi'' amulets, which have cut across caste and class lines,<ref name=\"HeitzmanWorden1996\" /> and Hindu and Muslim divisions.<ref name=\"MinesLamb2002\" /> In some communities or contexts, other figures, such as a matriarch, or a person in authority, can be included in the ceremony in ritual acknowledgement of their benefaction.<ref name=\"Chowdhry1994\" /> According to author Prem Chowdhry, \"The same symbolic protection is also requested from the high caste men by the low caste women in a work relationship situation.

Kolis are the fishermen community of the coastal state. The fishermen offer prayers to Lord Varuna, the Hindu god of Sea, to invoke his blessings.

The two boys become frustrated that they have no sister to celebrate Raksha Bandhan with. They ask their father Ganesha for a sister, but to no avail. Finally, saint Narada appears who persuades Ganesha that a daughter will enrich him as well as his sons. Ganesha agreed, and created a daughter named [[Santoshi Mata|Santoshi Maa]] by divine flames that emerged from Ganesh's wives, ''Riddhi'' (Amazing) and ''Siddhi'' (Perfection).

He was their ''malik'', their owner; they were more often ''dasis'' than ''patnis'' (wives). Yet Ganesha was married to them, albeit within a marriage different from other divine matches in the lack of a clear familial context. Such a context has recently emerged in the popular film ''Jai Santoshi Ma''. The film builds upon a text, also of recent vintage, in which Ganesha has a daughter, the neophyte goddess of satisfaction, Santoshi Ma. In the film, the role of Gane\u00a7a as family man is developed significantly. Santoshi Ma's genesis occurs on Raksha bandhan. Ganesha's sister is visiting for the tying of the rakhi. He calls her ''bahenmansa''\u2014his \"mind-born\" sister. Ganesha's wives, Rddhi and Siddhi, are also present, with their sons Subha and Labha. The boys are jealous, as they, unlike their father, have no sister with whom to tie the rakhi. They and the other women plead with their father, but to no avail; but then Narada appears and convinces Ganesha that the creation of an illustrious daughter will reflect much credit back onto himself. Ganesha assents and from Rddhi and Siddhi emerges a flame that engenders Santoshi Ma.</blockquote>\n\n===''Sikandar'' (1941 film)===\nFilm historian Arthur Pomeroy describes the manufacture of a modern and widespread Indian legend in the 1941 movie ''[[Sikandar (1941 film)|Sikandar]]'':<ref name=\"Pomeroy2017\">{{citation|last=Pomeroy|first=Arthur J.|title=A Companion to Ancient Greece and Rome on Screen|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3kwnDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT428|year=2017|publisher=Wiley|isbn=978-1-118-74144-3|page=428}}</ref> \n\n<blockquote>In ''Sikandar'' a very daring Roxane follows Alexander incognito to India and manages to gain admission to King Porus (in the Indian version: Puru), a conversation with a young, friendly Indian village woman named Surmaniya, Roxane learns about the Indian feast of Rakhi which is being celebrated at that very moment with the purpose of strengthening the bond between sister and brother (0:25\u20130:30). On this occasion, sisters tie a ribbon (i.e. rakhi) to their brothers' arms to symbolize their close relationships, and brothers offer presents and assistance in return. Besides, Roxane is also told that the relationship need not be one of consanguinity; every girl can choose a brother. Therefore, she decides to offer the rakhi to King Porus, who accepts the relationship after some hesitation, because he feels the need to apologize to Roxane, Darius's (a.k.a. Dara's) daughter, for not having helped her father when he asked for assistance against Alexander. As a result of their bond, he offers her gifts befitting her rank and promises not to harm Alexander (0:32\u201335). Later, when Porus comes into hand-to-hand combat with the Greek king, he stands by his promise and spares him (1:31). Interestingly, the rakhi episode with Porus is still to this day very popular in India and is cited as very early historical evidence for the origin of the authentic Hindu festival called Raksha Bandhan. Although examples of that legend can be traced in internet forums, Indian newspapers, a children's book and an educational video, I was not able to find its ancient origin.</blockquote>\n\n===Rani Karnavati and Emperor Humayun===\n{{Quote box\n|width     = 23em\n|border    = 1px\n|align     = right\n|bgcolor   =#D0F0F0\n|fontsize  = 85%\n|title_bg  =\n|title_fnt =\n|title     =\n|quote     = Bound by a sacred gift, in happier hours,<br/> To prove a brother's undecaying faith; <br/> Now when the star of Kurnivati lowers, <br/>He rushes on to danger or to death.<br/><br/> He came to the beleaguered walls too late,<br/>Vain was the splendid sacrifice to save; <br/>Famine and death were sitting at the gate, <br/>The flower of Rajasthan had found a grave.<ref name=\"Roberts1832\">{{citation|last=Roberts|first=Emma|title=Oriental Scenes, dramatic sketches and tales, with other poems|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=C6BgAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA125|year=1832|pages=125\u2013}}</ref><ref name=\"Fhlathuin2015\">{{citation|last=Fhlathuin|first=Maire ni|title=British India and Victorian Literary Culture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nKYkDQAAQBAJ&pg=PT174|year=2015|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|isbn=978-1-4744-0776-2|pages=174\u2013}}</ref>\n|salign    = right\n|source    =&nbsp;\u2014 From poem, \"The Rakhi,\" in ''Oriental scenes, dramatic sketches, and tales'' (1832), by [[Emma Roberts (author)|Emma Roberts]], p. 125 \n}}\nAnother controversial historical account is that of [[Rani Karnavati]] of [[Chittor]] and [[Mughal Emperor]] [[Humayun]], which dates to 1535 CE.

It had a hemispherical cross-flow cylinder head with valves inclined from the vertical; originally at 30&nbsp;degrees (inlet) and 45&nbsp;degrees (exhaust) and later standardised to 45 degrees for both inlet and exhaust.\n\n[[File:Jaguar XK6 engine 1.jpg|right|thumb|[[Jaguar XK6 engine|XK engine]] in an [[Jaguar E-Type|E-Type]]]]\n\nAs fuel [[octane]] ratings were relatively low from 1948 onwards, three piston configuration were offered: domed (high octane), flat (medium octane), and dished (low octane).\n\nThe main designer, [[William Heynes|William \"Bill\" Heynes]], assisted by [[Walter Hassan|Walter \"Wally\" Hassan]], was determined to develop the Twin [[Overhead camshaft|OHC]] unit. Bill Lyons agreed over misgivings from Hassan. It was risky to take what had previously been considered a racing or low-volume and cantankerous engine needing constant fettling and apply it to reasonable volume production saloon cars.\n\nThe subsequent engine (in various versions) was the mainstay powerplant of Jaguar, used in the XK 120, Mk VII Saloon, Mk I and II Saloons and XK 140 and 150. It was also employed in the E Type, itself a development from the race winning and Le Mans conquering C and D Type Sports Racing cars refined as the short-lived XKSS, a road-legal D-Type.\n\nFew engine types have demonstrated such ubiquity and longevity: Jaguar used the Twin OHC ''XK Engine'', as it came to be known, in the Jaguar XJ6 saloon from 1969 through 1992, and employed in a J60 variant as the power plant in such diverse vehicles as the British Army's [[Combat Vehicle Reconnaissance (Tracked)]] family of vehicles, as well as the [[Fox armoured reconnaissance vehicle]], the [[Ferret armoured car|Ferret Scout Car]], and the Stonefield four-wheel-drive all-terrain lorry. Properly maintained, the standard production XK Engine would achieve 200,000 miles of useful life.\n\nTwo of the proudest moments in Jaguar's long history in motor sport involved winning the [[24 Hours of Le Mans|Le Mans 24 hours race]], firstly in 1951 and again in 1953. Victory at the 1955 Le Mans was overshadowed by it being the occasion of [[1955 Le Mans disaster|the worst motorsport accident in history]]. Later in the hands of the Scottish racing team Ecurie Ecosse two more wins were added in 1956 and 1957.\n\nIn spite of such a performance orientation, it was always Lyons' intention to build the business by producing world-class sporting saloons in larger numbers than the sports car market could support. Jaguar secured financial stability and a reputation for excellence with a series of elegantly styled luxury saloons that included the 3-litre and 3\u00bd litre cars, the Mark VII, VIII, and IX, the compact Mark I and 2, and the XJ6 and XJ12. All were deemed very good values, with comfortable rides, good handling, high performance, and great style.\n\nCombined with the trend-setting XK 120, XK 140, and XK 150 series of sports car, and nonpareil E-Type,{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} Jaguar's elan as a prestige motorcar manufacturer had few rivals. The company's post-War achievements are remarkable, considering both the shortages that drove Britain (the [[Ministry of Supply]] still allocated raw materials) and the state of metallurgical development of the era.\n\n===Daimler===\nIn 1950, Jaguar agreed to lease from the Ministry of Supply the Daimler Shadow 2 factory in [[Browns Lane plant|Browns Lane]], Allesley, Coventry, which at the time was being used by [[Daimler Company|The Daimler Company Limited]] and moved to the new site from Foleshill over the next 12 months.<ref name=LyonsBio>'Sir William Lyons \u2013 The Official Biography', Philip Porter & Paul Skilleter, page 120 onwards</ref> Jaguar purchased Daimler \u2013 not to be confused with [[Daimler-Benz]] or [[Daimler AG]]\u2014in 1960 from [[Birmingham Small Arms Company|BSA]].

The model has been in production since 1968 with the first generation being the last Jaguar car to have creative input by the company's founder, [[William Lyons|Sir William Lyons]], although this is disputed as some Jaguar historians claim that the second generation XJ \u2013 the [[Jaguar XJ40|XJ40]] series  \u2013 was the last car which Lyons had influenced.  The XJ40 originally launched in 1986 and went through two major revamps in 1994 ([[Jaguar X300|X300]]) and 1997 ([[Jaguar X308|X308]]) for a total production run of 17 years.  In early 2003, the third generation XJ \u2013 the [[Jaguar X350|X350]] \u2013 arrived in showrooms and while the car's exterior and interior styling were traditional in appearance, the car was completely re-engineered. Its styling attracted much criticism from many motoring journalists who claimed that the car looked old-fashioned and barely more modern than its predecessor, many even citing that the 'Lyons line' had been lost in the translation from XJ40 into X350 XJ, even though beneath the shell lay a highly advanced aluminium construction that put the XJ very near the top of its class.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.autocar.co.uk/jaguar/xj-series/ |title=Jaguar XJ Series |publisher=Autocars.co.uk |accessdate=19 June 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090709094043/http://www.autocar.co.uk/jaguar/xj-series |archive-date=9 July 2009 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nJaguar responded to the criticism with the introduction of the fourth generation XJ, launched in 2009.

It had a hemispherical cross-flow cylinder head with valves inclined from the vertical; originally at 30&nbsp;degrees (inlet) and 45&nbsp;degrees (exhaust) and later standardised to 45 degrees for both inlet and exhaust.\n\n[[File:Jaguar XK6 engine 1.jpg|right|thumb|[[Jaguar XK6 engine|XK engine]] in an [[Jaguar E-Type|E-Type]]]]\n\nAs fuel [[octane]] ratings were relatively low from 1948 onwards, three piston configuration were offered: domed (high octane), flat (medium octane), and dished (low octane).\n\nThe main designer, [[William Heynes|William \"Bill\" Heynes]], assisted by [[Walter Hassan|Walter \"Wally\" Hassan]], was determined to develop the Twin [[Overhead camshaft|OHC]] unit. Bill Lyons agreed over misgivings from Hassan. It was risky to take what had previously been considered a racing or low-volume and cantankerous engine needing constant fettling and apply it to reasonable volume production saloon cars.\n\nThe subsequent engine (in various versions) was the mainstay powerplant of Jaguar, used in the XK 120, Mk VII Saloon, Mk I and II Saloons and XK 140 and 150. It was also employed in the E Type, itself a development from the race winning and Le Mans conquering C and D Type Sports Racing cars refined as the short-lived XKSS, a road-legal D-Type.\n\nFew engine types have demonstrated such ubiquity and longevity: Jaguar used the Twin OHC ''XK Engine'', as it came to be known, in the Jaguar XJ6 saloon from 1969 through 1992, and employed in a J60 variant as the power plant in such diverse vehicles as the British Army's [[Combat Vehicle Reconnaissance (Tracked)]] family of vehicles, as well as the [[Fox armoured reconnaissance vehicle]], the [[Ferret armoured car|Ferret Scout Car]], and the Stonefield four-wheel-drive all-terrain lorry. Properly maintained, the standard production XK Engine would achieve 200,000 miles of useful life.\n\nTwo of the proudest moments in Jaguar's long history in motor sport involved winning the [[24 Hours of Le Mans|Le Mans 24 hours race]], firstly in 1951 and again in 1953. Victory at the 1955 Le Mans was overshadowed by it being the occasion of [[1955 Le Mans disaster|the worst motorsport accident in history]]. Later in the hands of the Scottish racing team Ecurie Ecosse two more wins were added in 1956 and 1957.\n\nIn spite of such a performance orientation, it was always Lyons' intention to build the business by producing world-class sporting saloons in larger numbers than the sports car market could support. Jaguar secured financial stability and a reputation for excellence with a series of elegantly styled luxury saloons that included the 3-litre and 3\u00bd litre cars, the Mark VII, VIII, and IX, the compact Mark I and 2, and the XJ6 and XJ12. All were deemed very good values, with comfortable rides, good handling, high performance, and great style.\n\nCombined with the trend-setting XK 120, XK 140, and XK 150 series of sports car, and nonpareil E-Type,{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} Jaguar's elan as a prestige motorcar manufacturer had few rivals. The company's post-War achievements are remarkable, considering both the shortages that drove Britain (the [[Ministry of Supply]] still allocated raw materials) and the state of metallurgical development of the era.\n\n===Daimler===\nIn 1950, Jaguar agreed to lease from the Ministry of Supply the Daimler Shadow 2 factory in [[Browns Lane plant|Browns Lane]], Allesley, Coventry, which at the time was being used by [[Daimler Company|The Daimler Company Limited]] and moved to the new site from Foleshill over the next 12 months.<ref name=LyonsBio>'Sir William Lyons \u2013 The Official Biography', Philip Porter & Paul Skilleter, page 120 onwards</ref> Jaguar purchased Daimler \u2013 not to be confused with [[Daimler-Benz]] or [[Daimler AG]]\u2014in 1960 from [[Birmingham Small Arms Company|BSA]].

The decision to offload the site to Jaguar came as Peugeot discontinued the [[Talbot]] brand for passenger cars.

The XJ40 originally launched in 1986 and went through two major revamps in 1994 ([[Jaguar X300|X300]]) and 1997 ([[Jaguar X308|X308]]) for a total production run of 17 years.  In early 2003, the third generation XJ \u2013 the [[Jaguar X350|X350]] \u2013 arrived in showrooms and while the car's exterior and interior styling were traditional in appearance, the car was completely re-engineered. Its styling attracted much criticism from many motoring journalists who claimed that the car looked old-fashioned and barely more modern than its predecessor, many even citing that the 'Lyons line' had been lost in the translation from XJ40 into X350 XJ, even though beneath the shell lay a highly advanced aluminium construction that put the XJ very near the top of its class.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.autocar.co.uk/jaguar/xj-series/ |title=Jaguar XJ Series |publisher=Autocars.co.uk |accessdate=19 June 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090709094043/http://www.autocar.co.uk/jaguar/xj-series |archive-date=9 July 2009 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nJaguar responded to the criticism with the introduction of the fourth generation XJ, launched in 2009.

The XK100 4-cylinder 2-Litre version had broken records in Belgium travelling at 177&nbsp;mph.  This XK engine had been designed at night during the war when they would be on fire watch in the factory. After several attempts a final design was achieved. That is until owner William Lyons said \"make it quieter\".\n\nThe sportscar bearing its prefix X had originally been intended as a short production model of about 200 vehicles.
