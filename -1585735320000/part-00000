Thus, the first [[trees]] evolved. But bacteria and fungus did not immediately evolve the ability to decompose lignin, so the wood did not fully decay but became buried under sediment, eventually turning into coal. About 300 million years ago, mushrooms and other fungi developed this ability, ending the main coal-formation period of earth's history.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/mushroom-evolution-breaks-down-lignin-slows-coal-formation |title = White Rot Fungi Slowed Coal Formation}}</ref>\n\nAt various times in the geologic past, the Earth had dense forests<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fe.doe.gov/education/energylessons/coal/gen_howformed.html|title=How Coal Is Formed|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170118113211/http://www.fe.doe.gov/education/energylessons/coal/gen_howformed.html|archivedate=18 January 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref> in low-lying wetland areas. Due to natural processes such as flooding, these forests were buried underneath soil. As more and more soil deposited over them, they were compressed. The temperature also rose as they sank deeper and deeper. As the process continued the plant matter was protected from [[biodegradation]] and [[oxidation]], usually by mud or acidic water. This trapped the carbon in immense [[peat bog]]s that were eventually covered and deeply buried by sediments. Under high pressure and high temperature, dead vegetation was slowly converted to coal. The conversion of dead vegetation into coal is called [[wikt:coalification|coalification]]. Coalification starts with dead [[plant matter]] decaying into [[peat]]. Then over millions of years the heat and pressure of deep burial causes the loss of water, methane and carbon dioxide and an increase in the proportion of carbon.<ref name=\"BGS\"/> Thus first [[lignite]] (also called \"brown coal\"), then [[sub-bituminous coal]], [[bituminous coal]], and lastly [[anthracite]] (also called \"hard coal\" or \"black coal\") may be formed.<ref name=\"EIACoalExplained\"/><ref>{{Cite book| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=_29tNNeQKeMC&pg=PA18| title = Paleobotany: The biology and evolution of fossil plants| isbn = 978-0-12-373972-8| author1 = Taylor, Thomas N| author2 = Taylor, Edith L| author3 = Krings, Michael| year = 2009| url-status = live| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160516231216/https://books.google.com/books?id=_29tNNeQKeMC&pg=PA18| archivedate = 16 May 2016| df = dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe wide, shallow seas of the [[Carboniferous|Carboniferous Period]] provided ideal conditions for coal formation, although coal is known from most geological periods.

Coal can be used as a feedstock in the production of a wide range of chemical fertilizers and other chemical products. The main route to these products is [[coal gasification]] to produce [[syngas]]. Primary chemicals that are produced directly from the syngas include [[methanol]], [[hydrogen]] and [[carbon monoxide]], which are the chemical building blocks from which a whole spectrum of derivative chemicals are manufactured, including [[olefins]], [[acetic acid]], [[formaldehyde]], [[ammonia]], [[urea]] and others. The versatility of [[syngas]] as a precursor to primary chemicals and high-value derivative products provides the option of using coal to produce a wide range of valuable{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} commodities.\n\nBecause the slate of chemical products that can be made via coal gasification can in general also use feedstocks derived from [[natural gas]] and [[petroleum]], the chemical industry tends to use whatever feedstocks are most cost-effective. Therefore, interest in using coal tends to increase for higher oil and natural gas prices and during periods of high global economic growth that may strain oil and gas production. Also, production of chemicals from coal is of much higher interest in countries like South Africa and China{{citation needed|date=June 2019}} where there are abundant coal resources. The abundance of coal combined with lack of natural gas resources in China is a strong inducement for the coal to chemicals industry there. Similarly, Sasol has built and operated coal-to-chemicals facilities in South Africa.\n\nCoal to chemical processes require substantial quantities of water.

Approximately 75 [[Orders of magnitude (mass)#106 to 1011 kg|Tg]]/S per year of [[sulfur dioxide]] (SO<sub>2</sub>) is released from burning coal. After release, the sulfur dioxide is oxidized to gaseous H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>2</sub> which scatters solar radiation, hence its increase in the atmosphere exerts a cooling effect on climate. This beneficially masks some of the warming caused by increased greenhouse gases. However, the sulfur is precipitated out of the atmosphere as acid rain in a matter of weeks,<ref>{{cite journal|title=The oxidation rate and residence time of sulphur dioxide in the arctic atmosphere|author1=Barrie, L.A. |author2=Hoff, R.M. |journal=Atmospheric Environment|volume=18|issue=12|year=1984|pages=2711\u201322|doi=10.1016/0004-6981(84)90337-8|bibcode=1984AtmEn..18.2711B }}</ref> whereas carbon dioxide remains in the atmosphere for hundreds of years.

Thus, the first [[trees]] evolved. But bacteria and fungus did not immediately evolve the ability to decompose lignin, so the wood did not fully decay but became buried under sediment, eventually turning into coal. About 300 million years ago, mushrooms and other fungi developed this ability, ending the main coal-formation period of earth's history.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/mushroom-evolution-breaks-down-lignin-slows-coal-formation |title = White Rot Fungi Slowed Coal Formation}}</ref>\n\nAt various times in the geologic past, the Earth had dense forests<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fe.doe.gov/education/energylessons/coal/gen_howformed.html|title=How Coal Is Formed|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170118113211/http://www.fe.doe.gov/education/energylessons/coal/gen_howformed.html|archivedate=18 January 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref> in low-lying wetland areas. Due to natural processes such as flooding, these forests were buried underneath soil. As more and more soil deposited over them, they were compressed. The temperature also rose as they sank deeper and deeper. As the process continued the plant matter was protected from [[biodegradation]] and [[oxidation]], usually by mud or acidic water. This trapped the carbon in immense [[peat bog]]s that were eventually covered and deeply buried by sediments. Under high pressure and high temperature, dead vegetation was slowly converted to coal. The conversion of dead vegetation into coal is called [[wikt:coalification|coalification]]. Coalification starts with dead [[plant matter]] decaying into [[peat]]. Then over millions of years the heat and pressure of deep burial causes the loss of water, methane and carbon dioxide and an increase in the proportion of carbon.<ref name=\"BGS\"/> Thus first [[lignite]] (also called \"brown coal\"), then [[sub-bituminous coal]], [[bituminous coal]], and lastly [[anthracite]] (also called \"hard coal\" or \"black coal\") may be formed.<ref name=\"EIACoalExplained\"/><ref>{{Cite book| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=_29tNNeQKeMC&pg=PA18| title = Paleobotany: The biology and evolution of fossil plants| isbn = 978-0-12-373972-8| author1 = Taylor, Thomas N| author2 = Taylor, Edith L| author3 = Krings, Michael| year = 2009| url-status = live| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160516231216/https://books.google.com/books?id=_29tNNeQKeMC&pg=PA18| archivedate = 16 May 2016| df = dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe wide, shallow seas of the [[Carboniferous|Carboniferous Period]] provided ideal conditions for coal formation, although coal is known from most geological periods.

Coal can be used as a feedstock in the production of a wide range of chemical fertilizers and other chemical products. The main route to these products is [[coal gasification]] to produce [[syngas]]. Primary chemicals that are produced directly from the syngas include [[methanol]], [[hydrogen]] and [[carbon monoxide]], which are the chemical building blocks from which a whole spectrum of derivative chemicals are manufactured, including [[olefins]], [[acetic acid]], [[formaldehyde]], [[ammonia]], [[urea]] and others. The versatility of [[syngas]] as a precursor to primary chemicals and high-value derivative products provides the option of using coal to produce a wide range of valuable{{citation needed|date=December 2018}} commodities.\n\nBecause the slate of chemical products that can be made via coal gasification can in general also use feedstocks derived from [[natural gas]] and [[petroleum]], the chemical industry tends to use whatever feedstocks are most cost-effective. Therefore, interest in using coal tends to increase for higher oil and natural gas prices and during periods of high global economic growth that may strain oil and gas production. Also, production of chemicals from coal is of much higher interest in countries like South Africa and China{{citation needed|date=June 2019}} where there are abundant coal resources. The abundance of coal combined with lack of natural gas resources in China is a strong inducement for the coal to chemicals industry there.

Approximately 75 [[Orders of magnitude (mass)#106 to 1011 kg|Tg]]/S per year of [[sulfur dioxide]] (SO<sub>2</sub>) is released from burning coal. After release, the sulfur dioxide is oxidized to gaseous H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>2</sub> which scatters solar radiation, hence its increase in the atmosphere exerts a cooling effect on climate. This beneficially masks some of the warming caused by increased greenhouse gases. However, the sulfur is precipitated out of the atmosphere as acid rain in a matter of weeks,<ref>{{cite journal|title=The oxidation rate and residence time of sulphur dioxide in the arctic atmosphere|author1=Barrie, L.A. |author2=Hoff, R.M. |journal=Atmospheric Environment|volume=18|issue=12|year=1984|pages=2711\u201322|doi=10.1016/0004-6981(84)90337-8|bibcode=1984AtmEn..18.2711B }}</ref> whereas carbon dioxide remains in the atmosphere for hundreds of years.

With a pair of tunnels under the Wellington hills, the deviation alleviated issues with more and heavier freight traffic on the steep and twisting original route where long sections at 1 in 60 gradient required banker engines. The Wellington to Johnsonville section of the original line was retained as the [[Johnsonville Line]] and the Johnsonville to Tawa section closed.\n\nThe sections from Plimmerton to South Junction, north of Pukerua Bay and Muri, and North Junction to Paekakariki were duplicated in 1940. From 24 July 1940 electrification at 1500 V DC of the southern section of the NIMT from Wellington to Paekakariki was completed.  The [[Tawa Flat deviation]] has a long tunnel (Tawa No 2)  not suitable for steam operation because of excessive smoke (although steam trains were temporarily operated in the new deviation from 1935). A Centralised Train Control (CTC) system was installed in 1940, so that new signal boxes were not required and five stations between Tawa and Pukerua Bay no longer had to be continually staffed for Tablet operation; see [[Kapiti Line#Duplication|Kapiti Line]]. Electrification eliminated the need to relieve the steep (1 in 57) gradients from Plimmerton to the Pukerua Bay summit by a deviation to the east and allowed more frequent suburban passenger trains (and allowed suburban electric multiple units to run on this section from September 1949).\n[[File:Electric Locomotives Near Paekakariki.jpg|thumb|[[New Zealand EW class locomotive|EW]]1805 hauling [[New Zealand DC class locomotive|DC]] 4611 near Paekakariki on the electrified Wellington section.

Some tunnels were opened out or bypassed by deviations while in others clearances were increased, and curves eased. The section between [[Ohakune]] and Horopito was realigned with three viaducts replaced to handle higher loads and speeds.

Wellington's urban network is electrified at ([[1500 V DC railway electrification|1500 V DC]]); as formerly used in other sections of the New Zealand  network. In Wellington the operating voltage has been increased to 1700 V DC since the full introduction of the [[New Zealand FP class electric multiple unit|Matangi EMU]], to increase the power available.  \n \nElectrification of the NIMT was mooted by electrical engineer [[Evan Parry]] in the first volume of the ''New Zealand Journal of Science and Technology'' in November 1918. In light of a national coal shortage following [[World War I]], Parry argued that the network was under great strain due to ever-increasing volumes of freight, and the use of steam traction was partly to blame. Parry also noted that there was great potential for cheap hydro-electricity generation in the central North Island to power electrification.\n\nThe first part of the NIMT to be electrified was the [[Wellington]]\u2013[[Paekakariki railway station|Paekakariki]] section via the [[Tawa Flat deviation]] that was completed on 24 July 1940. This was largely to prevent smoke nuisance in the 4.3&nbsp;km No. 2 tunnel, and to provide for banking on the Paekakariki to Pukerua Bay section. Electric traction in this section is now used only by [[Transdev Wellington]] for Metlink suburban passenger services on the [[Kapiti Line]], and was extended to [[Paraparaumu railway station|Paraparaumu]] on 7 May 1983 and [[Waikanae railway station|Waikanae]] on 20 February 2011. Funded by the [[Greater Wellington Regional Council]], the extension to Waikanae coincided with the delivery of new [[New Zealand FP class electric multiple unit|FP class Matangi]] [[electric multiple unit]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kiwirail.co.nz/index.php?page=wellington-projects|title=KiwiRail \u2013 Wellington Projects|date=22 September 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722185555/http://www.kiwirail.co.nz/index.php?page=wellington-projects|archivedate=22 July 2011}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the Second World War railway services suffered due to skill and coal shortages. Skilled staff sought employment opportunities elsewhere in the economy. From 1948 to 1951 the General Manager of the Railways Department, Francis William Aickin, advocated electrification of the entire line, despite protests from his engineering staff. Aickin had previously been Staff Superintendent and Chief Legal Advisor to the Department, and considered using diesel locomotives for trains on the NIMT to be too expensive. He turned his attention to electrification, mainly because he saw that it could relieve the coal situation and prevent high expenditure on imported fuels.\n\nHe commissioned a study into electrification, which concluded that a low-frequency AC system could be cheaper than 1500 V DC, the system in use in Wellington. Aickin sent a technical mission of four senior officers overseas in March 1949 and travelled overseas himself to negotiate a tentative contract with a British construction company. The Chief Mechanical Engineer and Chief Accountant specified and costed the system and Aickin was able to complete a substantial report justifying the NIMT electrification and submit it to the Government.\n\nOfficers from [[New Zealand Treasury]] and the [[New Zealand Ministry of Works|Ministry of Works]] and two experts from [[Sweden]] (Thelander and Edenius) commented on the proposal and in December 1950 the Government granted approval in principle and agreed to appoint Thelander as a consultant. However, Aickin fell out with the then National Government and retired as General Manager in July 1951. With the change in regime, the electrification proposal disappeared.\n\nA key assumption of Aickin's report was that traffic on the NIMT would grow by 50% from 1948 to 1961. Since a diesel-electric locomotive was in fact a travelling power station, the savings through electrification compared to diesel could be regarded as the difference between the cost of buying bulk electrical energy generated substantially from New Zealand resources and the cost of generating electricity in a small plant using imported diesel fuel.\n\nHowever, the Royal Commission on Railways created following Aickin's tenure rejected the report's findings. Aickin's successor, H.C. Lusty, revised the tentative contract with [[English Electric]] to specify [[NZR DF class (1954)|DF]] diesel-electric locomotives. They were later found to be unreliable, and only ten were supplied. 42 [[New Zealand DG and DH class locomotive|DG]] locomotives were supplied instead for secondary lines. For main lines including the NIMT, [[New Zealand DA class locomotive|D<sup>A</sup> class]] diesel-electric locomotives were ordered from General Motors.\n\nThe {{convert|411|km|mi|abbr=on}} section between [[Palmerston North]] and [[Hamilton, New Zealand|Hamilton]] was electrified at 25 kV 50&nbsp;Hz [[alternating current|AC]], opened on 24 June 1988<ref name=\"nzro_winter_1988\">{{cite journal|journal=New Zealand Railway Observer|title=North Island Main Trunk Electrified|date=Autumn 1988|publisher=[[New Zealand Railway and Locomotive Society]]|issn=00288624|volume=45 no. 1|number=194|page=49|author=Tom McGavin}}</ref> as one of the [[Robert Muldoon|Muldoon]] [[Third National Government of New Zealand|National Government's]] \"[[Think Big]]\" energy development projects. An overall cost in excess of $100 million had been projected, with some 40% being for the locomotives, but the final cost was about $250 million. The economics of the project was greatly undermined by the fall of the price of oil in the 1980s and the deregulation of land transport, which removed the long-distance monopoly NZR held when the cost-benefit report was written.\n[[File:EF30163+Overlander NearWaiouru 22March2003 JChristianson.jpg|thumb|[[New Zealand EF class locomotive|EF]]30163 hauling The [[Overlander (train)|Overlander]] on the [[25 kV AC railway electrification|25 kV AC]] [[Railway electrification system|electrified]] section in 2003.]]\nThe electrification of the section, which had its genesis in a study group set up in June 1974 to report on measures to be taken to cope with increasing rail traffic volumes, received approval in 1980. This led to a technical study carried out with assistance from the Japanese [[Railway Technical Research Institute]]. The report stated that track capacity would be increased by electrification because such traction is faster and able to move more freight at once. The report stated, for example, that whereas a diesel locomotive could haul 720-tonne trains at {{convert|27|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}} up the [[Raurimu Spiral]], an electric locomotive could haul 1100/1200-tonne trains at {{convert|45|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}}, cutting 3\u20135 hours off journey times. Less fuel would be needed and employing regenerative braking in electric locomotives lowers the fuel consumption further.\n\nElectrification's advantages were reflected in the economic evaluation in the report, which showed a rate of return of 18%. Sensitivity analysis showed that this high rate of return gave the project robustness against lower traffic volumes than expected (the return remained positive even if traffic fell), against significant increases in construction cost, and against lower than expected rises in the diesel fuel price.\n\nPart of the project included replacing the copper wire communications system with a new [[fiber optic|fibre optic]] communications cable (due to interference caused by AC power with the DC copper wire system) between Wellington and Auckland. In 1994 New Zealand Rail Limited sold the cable to [[Clear Communications]] for telephone traffic, leasing part of it back for signalling.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://canterbury.cyberplace.org.nz/community/CAFCA/cafca94/sept94.html|title=September 1994&nbsp;decisions|publisher=[[Campaign Against Foreign Control of Aotearoa]]}}</ref>\n\nProposals to [[Auckland railway electrification|electrify the Auckland suburban rail network]] dated back to the 1960s,{{sfn|Churchman|1991|p=30}} they mainly coincided with proposals to electrify the NIMT in its entirety.

In 1932 the [[4-8-4]] [[NZR K class (1932)|K class]] was introduced, and later improved in 1939 with the [[NZR Ka class|K<sup>A</sup>]].\n\nThe introduction of the English Electric [[NZR DF class (1954)|D<sup>F</sup> class]] in 1954 began the end of the steam era, and in 1955 with the introduction of the [[New Zealand DA class locomotive|D<sup>A</sup>]] major withdrawals of steam locomotives began. 1972 saw the introduction of [[New Zealand DX class locomotive|D<sup>X</sup>]] locomotives and the [[NZR RM class (Silver Fern)|Silver Fern]] railcars: the latter remained in service between Auckland and Wellington until 1991.\n\nWith electrification and the introduction of the [[New Zealand EF class locomotive|EF class]] electric locomotives in the late 1980s, the DX class was mainly reassigned to other areas of the network, including hauling coal on the [[Midland Line, New Zealand|Midland Line]] in the [[South Island]]. Since then services between Te Rapa and Palmerston North have been worked mainly by the electrics, although some services are still diesel operated, such as those originating from or terminating on other lines, or originating from within the central section, like the paper pulp freight trains from Karioi.\n\nAs of May 2016, regular rolling stock on the NIMT include:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- style=\"background:#f9f9f9;\"\n!

The daily \"Express\" left earlier in the evening, followed by the \"Limited\", which had fewer stops for passengers.\n\nBetween 1963 and 1968 daytime trains were called the [[Scenic Daylight]]. In 1968, an [[NZR RM class|RM class]] [[NZR RM class (88 seater)|88-seater]] [[railcar]] was refurbished and repainted in a distinctive blue scheme that led to it being nicknamed the Blue Streak. It initially operated an unsuccessful service between [[Hamilton, New Zealand|Hamilton]] and Auckland in early 1968, and was transferred to the Auckland-Wellington run on 23 September 1968.\n[[File:Tolldc4093.jpg|thumb|A [[New Zealand DC class locomotive|DC]] hauls the now replaced [[Overlander (train)|Overlander]] long-distance passenger train between Auckland and Wellington.]]\nIn 1971 [[New Zealand Railways Department|NZR]] introduced the [[Silver Star (NZR train)|Silver Star]], a luxury sleeper train. The service was not economically viable, and was withdrawn in 1979. Much more successful was the [[NZR RM class (Silver Fern)|Silver Fern]], a daytime [[railcar]] service, introduced in 1972 to replace the \"Blue Streak\". This service was withdrawn in 1991 and replaced by [[Overlander (train)|The Overlander]].\n\nIn conjunction with the introduction of the carriage train Overlander service, the Silver Fern railcars were redeployed to start new services between Tauranga and Auckland \u2013 [[Kaimai Express]], and Auckland and Rotorua \u2013 [[Geyserland Express]], in 1991. In 2000 a new commuter service called the [[Waikato Connection]] was introduced between Hamilton and Auckland and ran in conjunction with the services to Tauranga and Rotorua until all three services were cancelled in 2001.\n\nOn 25 July 2006 Toll announced that the Overlander would cease at the end of September 2006, but on 28 September 2006 the train's continuation on a limited timetable was announced.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/section/story.cfm?c_id=1&ObjectID=10403445| title=Overlander to continue running| work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] | date=28 September 2006| accessdate=15 October 2007}}</ref> It ran daily during the summer months and thrice-weekly for the balance of the year.\n\nIn 2012 KiwiRail announced the Overlander would be replaced by the [[Northern Explorer]], with new [[New Zealand AK class carriage|AK class carriages]] to provide a premium tourist train on a quicker timetable with fewer stops. It commenced on Monday 25 June 2012, and consists of one train running from Auckland to Wellington on Mondays, Thursdays and Saturdays, and Wellington to Auckland on Wednesdays, Fridays and Sundays. It has fewer stops than the Overlander, stopping only at Papakura, Hamilton, [[Otorohanga]], National Park, Ohakune, Palmerston North and Paraparaumu.\n\nThe [[Capital Connection (train)|Capital Connection]] commuter train operates between [[Palmerston North]] and Wellington.\n\nBoth KiwiRail and private enthusiast operators such as the Railway Enthusiasts Society, Mainline Steam and Steam Inc operate charter trains.\n\n===Auckland suburban===\n[[File:Britomart Outside Facade.jpg|thumb|The northern terminus of the NIMT, [[Britomart Transport Centre]].]]\n{{main|Public transport in Auckland|Auckland railway electrification}}\nSuburban trains run on the NIMT at regular intervals as follows:\n\n[[Eastern Line, Auckland|Eastern Line]] (Manukau to Britomart via Glen Innes) trains run on the NIMT between Puhinui and Britomart.\n\n[[Southern Line, Auckland|Southern Line]] (Papakura to Britomart via Otahuhu and Newmarket) trains run on the NIMT from Papakura to [[Westfield Junction]]. They then run on the [[North Auckland Line]] to Newmarket, and the [[Newmarket Line]] to the vicinity of [[Quay Park]], where they rejoin the NIMT only for the short section (about 500 metres) into Britomart. A diesel train shuttle service runs on the NIMT between Pukekohe and Papakura.\n\n[[Onehunga Line]] and [[Western Line, Auckland|Western Line]] trains use the NIMT only for the short section (about 500 metres) from the vicinity of Quay Park into Britomart.\n\n===Wellington suburban===\n[[File:Wellington Railway Station by night.

With a pair of tunnels under the Wellington hills, the deviation alleviated issues with more and heavier freight traffic on the steep and twisting original route where long sections at 1 in 60 gradient required banker engines. The Wellington to Johnsonville section of the original line was retained as the [[Johnsonville Line]] and the Johnsonville to Tawa section closed.\n\nThe sections from Plimmerton to South Junction, north of Pukerua Bay and Muri, and North Junction to Paekakariki were duplicated in 1940. From 24 July 1940 electrification at 1500 V DC of the southern section of the NIMT from Wellington to Paekakariki was completed.  The [[Tawa Flat deviation]] has a long tunnel (Tawa No 2)  not suitable for steam operation because of excessive smoke (although steam trains were temporarily operated in the new deviation from 1935). A Centralised Train Control (CTC) system was installed in 1940, so that new signal boxes were not required and five stations between Tawa and Pukerua Bay no longer had to be continually staffed for Tablet operation; see [[Kapiti Line#Duplication|Kapiti Line]]. Electrification eliminated the need to relieve the steep (1 in 57) gradients from Plimmerton to the Pukerua Bay summit by a deviation to the east and allowed more frequent suburban passenger trains (and allowed suburban electric multiple units to run on this section from September 1949).\n[[File:Electric Locomotives Near Paekakariki.jpg|thumb|[[New Zealand EW class locomotive|EW]]1805 hauling [[New Zealand DC class locomotive|DC]] 4611 near Paekakariki on the electrified Wellington section.

Some tunnels were opened out or bypassed by deviations while in others clearances were increased, and curves eased. The section between [[Ohakune]] and Horopito was realigned with three viaducts replaced to handle higher loads and speeds.

Wellington's urban network is electrified at ([[1500 V DC railway electrification|1500 V DC]]); as formerly used in other sections of the New Zealand  network. In Wellington the operating voltage has been increased to 1700 V DC since the full introduction of the [[New Zealand FP class electric multiple unit|Matangi EMU]], to increase the power available.  \n \nElectrification of the NIMT was mooted by electrical engineer [[Evan Parry]] in the first volume of the ''New Zealand Journal of Science and Technology'' in November 1918. In light of a national coal shortage following [[World War I]], Parry argued that the network was under great strain due to ever-increasing volumes of freight, and the use of steam traction was partly to blame. Parry also noted that there was great potential for cheap hydro-electricity generation in the central North Island to power electrification.\n\nThe first part of the NIMT to be electrified was the [[Wellington]]\u2013[[Paekakariki railway station|Paekakariki]] section via the [[Tawa Flat deviation]] that was completed on 24 July 1940. This was largely to prevent smoke nuisance in the 4.3&nbsp;km No. 2 tunnel, and to provide for banking on the Paekakariki to Pukerua Bay section. Electric traction in this section is now used only by [[Transdev Wellington]] for Metlink suburban passenger services on the [[Kapiti Line]], and was extended to [[Paraparaumu railway station|Paraparaumu]] on 7 May 1983 and [[Waikanae railway station|Waikanae]] on 20 February 2011. Funded by the [[Greater Wellington Regional Council]], the extension to Waikanae coincided with the delivery of new [[New Zealand FP class electric multiple unit|FP class Matangi]] [[electric multiple unit]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kiwirail.co.nz/index.php?page=wellington-projects|title=KiwiRail \u2013 Wellington Projects|date=22 September 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722185555/http://www.kiwirail.co.nz/index.php?page=wellington-projects|archivedate=22 July 2011}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the Second World War railway services suffered due to skill and coal shortages. Skilled staff sought employment opportunities elsewhere in the economy. From 1948 to 1951 the General Manager of the Railways Department, Francis William Aickin, advocated electrification of the entire line, despite protests from his engineering staff. Aickin had previously been Staff Superintendent and Chief Legal Advisor to the Department, and considered using diesel locomotives for trains on the NIMT to be too expensive. He turned his attention to electrification, mainly because he saw that it could relieve the coal situation and prevent high expenditure on imported fuels.\n\nHe commissioned a study into electrification, which concluded that a low-frequency AC system could be cheaper than 1500 V DC, the system in use in Wellington. Aickin sent a technical mission of four senior officers overseas in March 1949 and travelled overseas himself to negotiate a tentative contract with a British construction company. The Chief Mechanical Engineer and Chief Accountant specified and costed the system and Aickin was able to complete a substantial report justifying the NIMT electrification and submit it to the Government.\n\nOfficers from [[New Zealand Treasury]] and the [[New Zealand Ministry of Works|Ministry of Works]] and two experts from [[Sweden]] (Thelander and Edenius) commented on the proposal and in December 1950 the Government granted approval in principle and agreed to appoint Thelander as a consultant. However, Aickin fell out with the then National Government and retired as General Manager in July 1951. With the change in regime, the electrification proposal disappeared.\n\nA key assumption of Aickin's report was that traffic on the NIMT would grow by 50% from 1948 to 1961. Since a diesel-electric locomotive was in fact a travelling power station, the savings through electrification compared to diesel could be regarded as the difference between the cost of buying bulk electrical energy generated substantially from New Zealand resources and the cost of generating electricity in a small plant using imported diesel fuel.\n\nHowever, the Royal Commission on Railways created following Aickin's tenure rejected the report's findings. Aickin's successor, H.C. Lusty, revised the tentative contract with [[English Electric]] to specify [[NZR DF class (1954)|DF]] diesel-electric locomotives. They were later found to be unreliable, and only ten were supplied. 42 [[New Zealand DG and DH class locomotive|DG]] locomotives were supplied instead for secondary lines. For main lines including the NIMT, [[New Zealand DA class locomotive|D<sup>A</sup> class]] diesel-electric locomotives were ordered from General Motors.\n\nThe {{convert|411|km|mi|abbr=on}} section between [[Palmerston North]] and [[Hamilton, New Zealand|Hamilton]] was electrified at 25 kV 50&nbsp;Hz [[alternating current|AC]], opened on 24 June 1988<ref name=\"nzro_winter_1988\">{{cite journal|journal=New Zealand Railway Observer|title=North Island Main Trunk Electrified|date=Autumn 1988|publisher=[[New Zealand Railway and Locomotive Society]]|issn=00288624|volume=45 no. 1|number=194|page=49|author=Tom McGavin}}</ref> as one of the [[Robert Muldoon|Muldoon]] [[Third National Government of New Zealand|National Government's]] \"[[Think Big]]\" energy development projects. An overall cost in excess of $100 million had been projected, with some 40% being for the locomotives, but the final cost was about $250 million. The economics of the project was greatly undermined by the fall of the price of oil in the 1980s and the deregulation of land transport, which removed the long-distance monopoly NZR held when the cost-benefit report was written.\n[[File:EF30163+Overlander NearWaiouru 22March2003 JChristianson.jpg|thumb|[[New Zealand EF class locomotive|EF]]30163 hauling The [[Overlander (train)|Overlander]] on the [[25 kV AC railway electrification|25 kV AC]] [[Railway electrification system|electrified]] section in 2003.]]\nThe electrification of the section, which had its genesis in a study group set up in June 1974 to report on measures to be taken to cope with increasing rail traffic volumes, received approval in 1980. This led to a technical study carried out with assistance from the Japanese [[Railway Technical Research Institute]]. The report stated that track capacity would be increased by electrification because such traction is faster and able to move more freight at once. The report stated, for example, that whereas a diesel locomotive could haul 720-tonne trains at {{convert|27|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}} up the [[Raurimu Spiral]], an electric locomotive could haul 1100/1200-tonne trains at {{convert|45|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}}, cutting 3\u20135 hours off journey times. Less fuel would be needed and employing regenerative braking in electric locomotives lowers the fuel consumption further.\n\nElectrification's advantages were reflected in the economic evaluation in the report, which showed a rate of return of 18%. Sensitivity analysis showed that this high rate of return gave the project robustness against lower traffic volumes than expected (the return remained positive even if traffic fell), against significant increases in construction cost, and against lower than expected rises in the diesel fuel price.\n\nPart of the project included replacing the copper wire communications system with a new [[fiber optic|fibre optic]] communications cable (due to interference caused by AC power with the DC copper wire system) between Wellington and Auckland. In 1994 New Zealand Rail Limited sold the cable to [[Clear Communications]] for telephone traffic, leasing part of it back for signalling.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://canterbury.cyberplace.org.nz/community/CAFCA/cafca94/sept94.html|title=September 1994&nbsp;decisions|publisher=[[Campaign Against Foreign Control of Aotearoa]]}}</ref>\n\nProposals to [[Auckland railway electrification|electrify the Auckland suburban rail network]] dated back to the 1960s,{{sfn|Churchman|1991|p=30}} they mainly coincided with proposals to electrify the NIMT in its entirety.

In 1932 the [[4-8-4]] [[NZR K class (1932)|K class]] was introduced, and later improved in 1939 with the [[NZR Ka class|K<sup>A</sup>]].\n\nThe introduction of the English Electric [[NZR DF class (1954)|D<sup>F</sup> class]] in 1954 began the end of the steam era, and in 1955 with the introduction of the [[New Zealand DA class locomotive|D<sup>A</sup>]] major withdrawals of steam locomotives began. 1972 saw the introduction of [[New Zealand DX class locomotive|D<sup>X</sup>]] locomotives and the [[NZR RM class (Silver Fern)|Silver Fern]] railcars: the latter remained in service between Auckland and Wellington until 1991.\n\nWith electrification and the introduction of the [[New Zealand EF class locomotive|EF class]] electric locomotives in the late 1980s, the DX class was mainly reassigned to other areas of the network, including hauling coal on the [[Midland Line, New Zealand|Midland Line]] in the [[South Island]]. Since then services between Te Rapa and Palmerston North have been worked mainly by the electrics, although some services are still diesel operated, such as those originating from or terminating on other lines, or originating from within the central section, like the paper pulp freight trains from Karioi.\n\nAs of May 2016, regular rolling stock on the NIMT include:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- style=\"background:#f9f9f9;\"\n!

The daily \"Express\" left earlier in the evening, followed by the \"Limited\", which had fewer stops for passengers.\n\nBetween 1963 and 1968 daytime trains were called the [[Scenic Daylight]]. In 1968, an [[NZR RM class|RM class]] [[NZR RM class (88 seater)|88-seater]] [[railcar]] was refurbished and repainted in a distinctive blue scheme that led to it being nicknamed the Blue Streak. It initially operated an unsuccessful service between [[Hamilton, New Zealand|Hamilton]] and Auckland in early 1968, and was transferred to the Auckland-Wellington run on 23 September 1968.\n[[File:Tolldc4093.jpg|thumb|A [[New Zealand DC class locomotive|DC]] hauls the now replaced [[Overlander (train)|Overlander]] long-distance passenger train between Auckland and Wellington.]]\nIn 1971 [[New Zealand Railways Department|NZR]] introduced the [[Silver Star (NZR train)|Silver Star]], a luxury sleeper train. The service was not economically viable, and was withdrawn in 1979. Much more successful was the [[NZR RM class (Silver Fern)|Silver Fern]], a daytime [[railcar]] service, introduced in 1972 to replace the \"Blue Streak\". This service was withdrawn in 1991 and replaced by [[Overlander (train)|The Overlander]].\n\nIn conjunction with the introduction of the carriage train Overlander service, the Silver Fern railcars were redeployed to start new services between Tauranga and Auckland \u2013 [[Kaimai Express]], and Auckland and Rotorua \u2013 [[Geyserland Express]], in 1991. In 2000 a new commuter service called the [[Waikato Connection]] was introduced between Hamilton and Auckland and ran in conjunction with the services to Tauranga and Rotorua until all three services were cancelled in 2001.\n\nOn 25 July 2006 Toll announced that the Overlander would cease at the end of September 2006, but on 28 September 2006 the train's continuation on a limited timetable was announced.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/section/story.cfm?c_id=1&ObjectID=10403445| title=Overlander to continue running| work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] | date=28 September 2006| accessdate=15 October 2007}}</ref> It ran daily during the summer months and thrice-weekly for the balance of the year.\n\nIn 2012 KiwiRail announced the Overlander would be replaced by the [[Northern Explorer]], with new [[New Zealand AK class carriage|AK class carriages]] to provide a premium tourist train on a quicker timetable with fewer stops. It commenced on Monday 25 June 2012, and consists of one train running from Auckland to Wellington on Mondays, Thursdays and Saturdays, and Wellington to Auckland on Wednesdays, Fridays and Sundays. It has fewer stops than the Overlander, stopping only at Papakura, Hamilton, [[Otorohanga]], National Park, Ohakune, Palmerston North and Paraparaumu.\n\nThe [[Capital Connection (train)|Capital Connection]] commuter train operates between [[Palmerston North]] and Wellington.\n\nBoth KiwiRail and private enthusiast operators such as the Railway Enthusiasts Society, Mainline Steam and Steam Inc operate charter trains.\n\n===Auckland suburban===\n[[File:Britomart Outside Facade.jpg|thumb|The northern terminus of the NIMT, [[Britomart Transport Centre]].]]\n{{main|Public transport in Auckland|Auckland railway electrification}}\nSuburban trains run on the NIMT at regular intervals as follows:\n\n[[Eastern Line, Auckland|Eastern Line]] (Manukau to Britomart via Glen Innes) trains run on the NIMT between Puhinui and Britomart.\n\n[[Southern Line, Auckland|Southern Line]] (Papakura to Britomart via Otahuhu and Newmarket) trains run on the NIMT from Papakura to [[Westfield Junction]]. They then run on the [[North Auckland Line]] to Newmarket, and the [[Newmarket Line]] to the vicinity of [[Quay Park]], where they rejoin the NIMT only for the short section (about 500 metres) into Britomart. A diesel train shuttle service runs on the NIMT between Pukekohe and Papakura.\n\n[[Onehunga Line]] and [[Western Line, Auckland|Western Line]] trains use the NIMT only for the short section (about 500 metres) from the vicinity of Quay Park into Britomart.\n\n===Wellington suburban===\n[[File:Wellington Railway Station by night.
