Maul commands her to meet with him on [[Dathomir]] and tells her that they will work more closely from now on, igniting his lightsaber.\n\n===Animated series===\n==== ''The Clone Wars'' ====\nDarth Maul's origins are elaborated upon in the third season of the animated series ''[[Star Wars: The Clone Wars (2008 TV series)|Star Wars: The Clone Wars]]'', which takes place between ''[[Attack of the Clones]]'' and ''[[Revenge of the Sith]]''.\nMaul is explained to have been a warrior of the Nightbrother clan on the planet [[Dathomir]] inhabited by the dominant Nightsister [[witchcraft]] society led by [[Mother Talzin]]. Maul's tattoos are described as the markings of a warrior.{{efn|Earlier sources identified his body art as Sith markings.}} Talzin instructs [[Savage Opress]] to find his long-lost brother.\n\nIn the fourth season, Maul is revealed to be alive, having survived his presumed death at Obi-Wan's hands. Having ended up on a junkyard planet via a dumpster craft, Maul has suffered from amnesia since Obi-Wan defeated him. Savage finds Maul and brings him to the devastated Dathomir, where Talzin restores Maul's mind and gives him robotic legs.

Needing followers, they travel to [[Florrum]] and manage to convince [[Weequay]] pirate Jiro and his crew to join them and betray their leader [[Hondo Ohnaka]]. Maul's pirates attack Hondo's loyal forces, and Maul once again duels Obi-Wan while Savage fights and kills Jedi Master [[Adi Gallia]]. Obi-Wan draws the two brothers away from the pirates, engaging them in a duel. Obi-Wan, though outnumbered, cuts off Savage's arm. While Maul and Savage are in the process of retreating, Hondo's crew open fire at them and shoot off one of Maul's robotic legs. Maul's ship is blasted by a missile as it attempts to take flight, but Maul and Savage manage to escape using one of the emergency pods. After several days, they are found floating in dead space and close to death by the [[Mandalorian]] Death Watch warriors, led by [[Pre Vizsla]]. They are taken back to Vizsla's settlement, and Maul's damaged cybernetic legs are replaced with a new prosthetic that resembles a more humanoid form, while Savage is fitted with a mechanical arm. Maul offers Vizsla the chance to reclaim [[Mandalore]] by recruiting Black Sun, the Pyke Syndicate, and [[Jabba the Hutt]]'s minions to create the criminal syndicate named the Shadow Collective.\n\nFrom there, Maul engineers Vizsla's rise to power: he orders his henchmen to attack Mandalore so the Death Watch can arrest them and appear as heroes to the denizens who have long lived under Duchess [[Satine Kryze]]'s [[pacifist]] rule. Vizsla betrays Maul, imprisoning him and Savage. Easily breaking free, Maul challenges Vizsla to a duel to take over Death Watch and Mandalore; he succeeds in killing Vizsla and claims his former co-conspirator's [[darksaber (fictional weapon)|darksaber]]. He wins the loyalty of most Death Watch members, but Bo Katan retreats along with those loyal to their previous leader. Maul then puts disgraced former prime minister Almec, whom Satine had imprisoned for corruption, in power as a puppet leader, solidifying his control over Mandalore. Maul anticipates Satine's contacting the Jedi Council as part of his plan to get Obi-Wan to Mandalore. Once Obi-Wan arrives, Maul captures him and murders Satine in front of him, hoping to make the Jedi suffer as much as he once did. Obi-Wan is later freed by Katan's Death Watch faction.\n\nMaul senses Darth Sidious arriving on Mandalore. Although impressed with his former apprentice's survival, Sidious declares Maul a rival and uses the Force to push and choke him and Savage. He then engages them both in lightsaber combat, fatally injuring Savage. After Savage dies from his wounds, Sidious reminds Maul of the [[Star Wars: Darth Bane: Rule of Two|Rule of Two]], and tells him that he has been replaced. Enraged, Maul pulls out both his lightsaber and darksaber and proceeds to fight Sidious on equal ground, but Sidious ultimately defeats him. Maul pleads for mercy, but Sidious ignores him and tortures him with blasts of Force lightning. Sidious reveals that he has no intention of killing Maul, remarking that he has other uses for his former apprentice.\n\nMaul will return in season 7 in which he duels [[Ahsoka Tano]] during the Siege of Mandalore. He will be portrayed by Ray Park using [[motion capture]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://io9.gizmodo.com/how-ray-park-and-the-mandalorian-are-upping-the-action-1834038997/amp|title=How Ray Park and The Mandalorian Are Upping the Action in Star Wars: The Clone Wars|last=Lussier|first=Germain|date=April 15, 2019|work=io9|accessdate=April 15, 2019}}</ref>\n\n====''Rebels''====\nAn older Maul appears in the season 2 finale of ''[[Star Wars Rebels]],''<ref name=\"Rebels\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/article/2016/03/24/darth-maul-returns-star-wars-rebels|title='Star Wars: Rebels' resurrects a familiar old foe|website=Ew.com|accessdate=10 November 2017}}</ref> which takes place between ''Revenge of the Sith'' and ''[[A New Hope]]''. Tracked by an [[Galactic Empire (Star Wars)|Imperial]] Inquisitor named the Eighth Brother, Maul is stranded on the ancient Sith world of [[Malachor]], where he is discovered among the ruins by series protagonist [[Ezra Bridger]]. Introducing himself as \"Old Master\" and seeking revenge against Sidious, Maul leads Ezra into an ancient Sith temple, where they discover a holocron that Maul claims can give them the knowledge needed to defeat the Sith. After recovering it, the two find Ezra's master [[Kanan Jarrus]] and former Jedi [[Ahsoka Tano]] locked in battle with the Eighth Brother. They also find the Inquisitors known as the Fifth Brother and the Seventh Sister, who have been pursuing the rebels for some time. Maul\u2014having cast aside the title of Darth\u2014reveals a new lightsaber disguised as a walking stick and joins the Jedi in battling their enemies, including Darth Vader.\n\nAfter the Inquisitors retreat, Maul wins the Jedi's trust by denouncing the Sith, and tells them that he cannot defeat Vader on his own. Working together, he and the Jedi ascend towards the top of the temple and successfully kill all three Inquisitors. Then, Maul reveals his intention to take Ezra as his apprentice, having already tricked him into activating the temple. After blinding Kanan, Maul briefly duels Ahsoka before facing Kanan again, only to be knocked off the temple's edge. However, he survives the fall and escapes Malachor in the Eighth Brother's [[TIE fighter]].\n\nMonths later, Maul takes the ''[[Ghost (Star Wars)|Ghost]]''{{'}}s crew hostage and threatens to kill them unless Kanan and Ezra bring both the Sith and Jedi holocrons to him. Maul takes the crew to a remote base in the Outer Rim where he awaits Kanan and Ezra's arrival. Then, the holocrons are hazardously united allowing Ezra and Maul to see visions of their desires: Ezra sees images of a way to destroy the Sith, images including \"twin suns\", while Maul sees a vision of his own. Kanan begs Ezra to look away before he sees too much of the dark side, while Maul tells him to ignore Kanan and keep looking. Ezra heeds his master's words and breaks off the connection, which causes a great explosion. Maul escapes in the confusion, uttering, \"He lives.\"\n\nMaul reappears after finding the rebels' secret base. He tells Ezra that because the connection was severed, they got bits and pieces of each other's visions. After the holocrons were destroyed, Maul discovered another way to get the information he needed. He travels to Dathomir with Ezra, and recreates a Nightsister spell to temporarily meld his and Ezra's minds. After this is completed, Ezra and Maul realize that they are both looking for Obi-Wan Kenobi.\n\nIn the episode \"Twin Suns\", Maul is shown lost on Tatooine. He decides to use Ezra to lure Obi-Wan out of hiding. His plan is ultimately successful as he tracks Ezra through the desert and the latter is rescued by Obi-Wan. Maul then comes face to face with his nemesis who ushered Ezra away. During their confrontation, Maul deduces that Obi-Wan is not only hiding, but is protecting [[Luke Skywalker|someone]]. Obi-Wan realizes Maul has to die and ignites his lightsaber. In a swift duel, Obi-Wan fatally wounds Maul. As he lies dying in Obi-Wan's arms, Maul asks if the person he is protecting is the [[Chosen One (Star Wars)|Chosen One]], and Obi-Wan (implying Luke as Anakin has since become Vader) replies that he is. Maul declares that this \"Chosen One\" will avenge them and dies.\n\n===Comics===\n{{Expand section|date=June 2019}}\n\n====''Darth Maul''====\nIn 2017, [[Marvel Comics|Marvel]] released ''Star Wars: Darth Maul'' a 5-issue prequel series centered on Darth Maul before the events of ''The Phantom Menace''.<ref>{{cite web|last=Juba |first=Joe |url=http://www.gameinformer.com/b/news/archive/2016/11/14/darth-maul-to-star-in-new-comic-book.aspx |title=Darth Maul To Star In New Star Wars Comic Book - News |publisher=www.GameInformer.com |date=2016-11-14 |accessdate=2016-12-19}}</ref>\n\n====''Darth Maul: Son of Dathomir''====\n[[Dark Horse Comics]] produced ''[[Darth Maul: Son of Dathomir]]'' based on the scripts and storyboards of an unproduced 4-episode story arc intended for ''The Clone Wars'' Season 7. After killing Savage Opress, Darth Sidious takes Maul to a Separatist prison, where [[Count Dooku]] tortures him for information about the Shadow Collective. Prime Minister Almec arranges Maul's escape and the latter then heads back to Zanbar to command the Death Watch army. However, he is followed by [[General Grievous]] and his droids, who battle with Maul and the Mandalorians. While they put up a fierce fight, Maul and his minions are ultimately overwhelmed by the droids. During the battle, Maul tears through the droid ranks and attacks Grievous, but is overpowered and forced to retreat. Afterwards, Maul confers with Mother Talzin (revealed to be his biological mother) and plots to draw out Sidious by capturing Dooku and Grievous. The scheme works, and Talzin is able to restore herself to her physical form, but she sacrifices herself to save Maul. Although Maul escapes with a company of loyal Mandalorians, the Shadow Collective has disintegrated due to the conflict with Sidious, as the Hutts, Pykes, and Black Sun have all abandoned Maul.\n\n===Novels===\n====''Ahsoka''====\nIn flashbacks during the novel ''[[Star Wars: Ahsoka]]'', it is revealed that during the final days of the Clone Wars, Maul and his forces were besieged on Mandalore by an army of clone troopers led by Ahsoka Tano and [[Captain Rex]].{{efn|Anakin and Obi-Wan were dispatched to Mandalore with Ahsoka, but were immediately called back to Coruscant to rescue Chancellor [[Palpatine]], thus leading into the opening sequence of ''Revenge of the Sith''.}} During the siege, Maul confronts and duels Ahsoka, and though he proves to be the stronger fighter, the former Jedi outwits him and traps him in a ray shield. However, before Maul can be taken into official custody, [[Order 66 (Star Wars)|Order 66]] is enacted and the clone troopers following Ahsoka turn on her, with the exception of Rex. With Rex's life in peril, Ahsoka abandons the chance of killing Maul, allowing the former Sith to escape once again.

The series is set in the shortly before the Battle of Naboo in ''Episode I \u2013 The Phantom Menace''.  The story follows Maul in his mission to destroy the leadership of the well-feared crime syndicate Black Sun. Maul spends his time serving under Darth Sidious, killing countlessly. His main target in the series is the leader of Black Sun, some time before [[Prince Xizor]] takes command of it.\n\nSeveral sources depict Maul returning from the dead in several different forms. The story \"Resurrection\" from [[Star Wars Tales 9|''Star Wars Tales'' #9]] depicts a cult creating a duplicate of Maul as a replacement for Darth Vader, only for Vader to kill him. The story ''Phantom Menaces'' in [[Star Wars Tales 17|''Star Wars Tales'' #17]] (set after ''[[Return of the Jedi]]'') depicts Luke Skywalker visiting Maul's home planet of [[Iridonia]] in an ambassadorial capacity, where he faces a \"solid state hologram\" of Maul projected from Maul's salvaged brain as part of a scientist's attempt to recreate Maul as Iridonia's \"champion\". Luke recognizes the disruption that Maul's existence is causing in the Force, and shuts down the life-support systems keeping the brain alive.\n\nIn 2005, Dark Horse Comics published ''[[Star Wars: Visionaries]]'', a compilation of non-canonical short comics made by the creators of ''Revenge of the Sith''. One story, \"Old Wounds\", depicts Maul with longer horns on his head, having survived his bisection at Obi-Wan's hands, with his missing bottom half replaced with [[cybernetic]] legs, similar to those of General Grievous (and his eventual revival in ''The Clone Wars''). He follows Obi-Wan throughout the galaxy, finally tracking him down on Tatooine a few years after the events of ''Revenge of the Sith''. Maul taunts Obi-Wan, saying that after he kills him, he will take a toddler-aged Luke Skywalker to his master, Emperor Palpatine. Maul plans to kill Vader and resume his rightful place at Palpatine's side. He ignites his new double-bladed lightsaber and engages Obi-Wan in a duel, but Obi-Wan again bests him in combat, cutting off his opponent's horns. Maul is killed by a blaster bolt to the head from [[Owen Lars]]. Obi-Wan thanks Owen, and says he will take Maul's body into the desert and burn it.\n\n====Novels====\nIn early 2012, a [[young adult fiction|young adult]] novel entitled ''Star Wars: The Wrath of Darth Maul'' was released by [[Scholastic Corporation|Scholastic]]. Maul is also featured prominently in comic series starting in this period, ''The Clone Wars: The Sith Hunters'' and ''Darth Maul: Death Sentence''. Set around the various episodes of ''The Clone Wars'' that featured Maul, the two books detail his and Savage Opress' journey across the galaxy as they seek vengeance on the Jedi.\n\nIn the 2012 novel ''[[Star Wars: Darth Plagueis|Darth Plagueis]]'', the titular Sith lord sends his apprentice, Darth Sidious, to the Force-rich world of Dathomir. A Dathomiri witch, or Nightsister, senses Sidious' power in the Force and approaches him. Assuming he is a Jedi, she begs him to take her [[Zabrak (Star Wars)|Zabrak]] infant son. She realizes that Sidious is not a Jedi, and explains how she is trying to save her son from a Nightsister named Talzin, who killed Maul's father. It is implied that Maul has a twin brother and that Talzin is only aware of one child. Sidious realizes the infant is strong in the Force, and would become a threat if found by the Jedi. Concealing the existence of his own master, Sidious raises Maul to believe that he is a Sith apprentice, but he actually intends him to be an expendable minion rather than an heir. Maul himself acknowledges his shortcomings, such as his limited understanding of politics, even as he tries to become a true Sith.\n\n=====''Darth Maul: Shadow Hunter''=====\n'''''Darth Maul: Shadow Hunter''''' is a novel by [[Michael Reaves]] released on February 1, 2001. It is a prequel novel occurring about six months before the events of ''The Phantom Menace''. The cover art was by David Stevenson. [[Del Rey Books|Del Rey]] aired a TV commercial for the novel in 1999.{{citation needed|date=September 2019}} As portrayed in the novel, Maul was raised by Sidious for as long as he can remember. Sidious then trains Maul as a Sith, marking his body with Sith tattoos. Maul initially goes on several missions of [[terrorism|terror]] for his master, killing politicians, crime bosses, merchants and warlords.\n\nSidious meets secretly with his [[Neimoidian]] contacts in the Trade Federation to finalize details in the plan to blockade Naboo. One member of the delegation is missing; suspecting betrayal, Sidious orders Maul to hunt down the traitor. Maul completes this task, but learns that the traitor had recorded proof of the Sith's manipulation of the Naboo blockade on a holocron to sell for profit. A [[suicide terrorism|suicidal]] attack by a Trade Federation-hired [[bounty hunter]] interferes with Maul's plan and the holocron is purchased by a [[Corellia]]n con man named Lorn Pavan.\nPavan realizes the nature of the information and seeks to take it to the [[Jedi Temple]]. Maul, for his part, is ordered by Sidious to retrieve the holocron and kill Pavan and anyone else who might have the information.  Meanwhile, a Jedi Padawan named Darsha Assant is faced with the Jedi trials to become a full-fledged Jedi Knight, and tries to save a member of Black Sun (which Maul had crippled in ''Saboteur'').\n\nPavan attempts to do business with a Hutt crime lord in one of the lower levels in Coruscant, but Maul arrives and kills the Hutt. Pavan escapes into the caverns where they meet Darsha and her master. The Jedi begin escorting Pavan and his droid to the temple but Maul soon attacks them. Darsha's master is slain while attempting to buy time for the others. Pavan and Darsha escape various dangers of Coruscant's subterranean levels before finding themselves in another battle.  Darsha, realizing that she cannot defeat Maul, draws out their duel long enough for Pavan's droid to repair a carbonite-freezing unit and seal Pavan and the droid inside it.  Darsha plunges her lightsaber into a pile of volatile gas canisters, killing her and causing an explosion that Maul barely escapes.  Upon surveying the scene, Maul feels no trace of Pavan in the Force, not realizing that the [[Carbonite (Star Wars)|carbonite]] [[hibernation]] has made his lifeforce undetectable.\n\nAn automatic timer frees Pavan from hibernation and he goes after Maul on his own.

Maul's tattoos are described as the markings of a warrior.{{efn|Earlier sources identified his body art as Sith markings.}} Talzin instructs [[Savage Opress]] to find his long-lost brother.\n\nIn the fourth season, Maul is revealed to be alive, having survived his presumed death at Obi-Wan's hands. Having ended up on a junkyard planet via a dumpster craft, Maul has suffered from amnesia since Obi-Wan defeated him.

Needing followers, they travel to [[Florrum]] and manage to convince [[Weequay]] pirate Jiro and his crew to join them and betray their leader [[Hondo Ohnaka]]. Maul's pirates attack Hondo's loyal forces, and Maul once again duels Obi-Wan while Savage fights and kills Jedi Master [[Adi Gallia]]. Obi-Wan draws the two brothers away from the pirates, engaging them in a duel. Obi-Wan, though outnumbered, cuts off Savage's arm. While Maul and Savage are in the process of retreating, Hondo's crew open fire at them and shoot off one of Maul's robotic legs. Maul's ship is blasted by a missile as it attempts to take flight, but Maul and Savage manage to escape using one of the emergency pods. After several days, they are found floating in dead space and close to death by the [[Mandalorian]] Death Watch warriors, led by [[Pre Vizsla]]. They are taken back to Vizsla's settlement, and Maul's damaged cybernetic legs are replaced with a new prosthetic that resembles a more humanoid form, while Savage is fitted with a mechanical arm. Maul offers Vizsla the chance to reclaim [[Mandalore]] by recruiting Black Sun, the Pyke Syndicate, and [[Jabba the Hutt]]'s minions to create the criminal syndicate named the Shadow Collective.\n\nFrom there, Maul engineers Vizsla's rise to power: he orders his henchmen to attack Mandalore so the Death Watch can arrest them and appear as heroes to the denizens who have long lived under Duchess [[Satine Kryze]]'s [[pacifist]] rule. Vizsla betrays Maul, imprisoning him and Savage. Easily breaking free, Maul challenges Vizsla to a duel to take over Death Watch and Mandalore; he succeeds in killing Vizsla and claims his former co-conspirator's [[darksaber (fictional weapon)|darksaber]]. He wins the loyalty of most Death Watch members, but Bo Katan retreats along with those loyal to their previous leader. Maul then puts disgraced former prime minister Almec, whom Satine had imprisoned for corruption, in power as a puppet leader, solidifying his control over Mandalore. Maul anticipates Satine's contacting the Jedi Council as part of his plan to get Obi-Wan to Mandalore. Once Obi-Wan arrives, Maul captures him and murders Satine in front of him, hoping to make the Jedi suffer as much as he once did. Obi-Wan is later freed by Katan's Death Watch faction.\n\nMaul senses Darth Sidious arriving on Mandalore. Although impressed with his former apprentice's survival, Sidious declares Maul a rival and uses the Force to push and choke him and Savage. He then engages them both in lightsaber combat, fatally injuring Savage. After Savage dies from his wounds, Sidious reminds Maul of the [[Star Wars: Darth Bane: Rule of Two|Rule of Two]], and tells him that he has been replaced. Enraged, Maul pulls out both his lightsaber and darksaber and proceeds to fight Sidious on equal ground, but Sidious ultimately defeats him. Maul pleads for mercy, but Sidious ignores him and tortures him with blasts of Force lightning. Sidious reveals that he has no intention of killing Maul, remarking that he has other uses for his former apprentice.\n\nMaul will return in season 7 in which he duels [[Ahsoka Tano]] during the Siege of Mandalore.

Tracked by an [[Galactic Empire (Star Wars)|Imperial]] Inquisitor named the Eighth Brother, Maul is stranded on the ancient Sith world of [[Malachor]], where he is discovered among the ruins by series protagonist [[Ezra Bridger]]. Introducing himself as \"Old Master\" and seeking revenge against Sidious, Maul leads Ezra into an ancient Sith temple, where they discover a holocron that Maul claims can give them the knowledge needed to defeat the Sith. After recovering it, the two find Ezra's master [[Kanan Jarrus]] and former Jedi [[Ahsoka Tano]] locked in battle with the Eighth Brother. They also find the Inquisitors known as the Fifth Brother and the Seventh Sister, who have been pursuing the rebels for some time. Maul\u2014having cast aside the title of Darth\u2014reveals a new lightsaber disguised as a walking stick and joins the Jedi in battling their enemies, including Darth Vader.\n\nAfter the Inquisitors retreat, Maul wins the Jedi's trust by denouncing the Sith, and tells them that he cannot defeat Vader on his own. Working together, he and the Jedi ascend towards the top of the temple and successfully kill all three Inquisitors. Then, Maul reveals his intention to take Ezra as his apprentice, having already tricked him into activating the temple. After blinding Kanan, Maul briefly duels Ahsoka before facing Kanan again, only to be knocked off the temple's edge. However, he survives the fall and escapes Malachor in the Eighth Brother's [[TIE fighter]].\n\nMonths later, Maul takes the ''[[Ghost (Star Wars)|Ghost]]''{{'}}s crew hostage and threatens to kill them unless Kanan and Ezra bring both the Sith and Jedi holocrons to him. Maul takes the crew to a remote base in the Outer Rim where he awaits Kanan and Ezra's arrival. Then, the holocrons are hazardously united allowing Ezra and Maul to see visions of their desires: Ezra sees images of a way to destroy the Sith, images including \"twin suns\", while Maul sees a vision of his own. Kanan begs Ezra to look away before he sees too much of the dark side, while Maul tells him to ignore Kanan and keep looking. Ezra heeds his master's words and breaks off the connection, which causes a great explosion. Maul escapes in the confusion, uttering, \"He lives.\"\n\nMaul reappears after finding the rebels' secret base. He tells Ezra that because the connection was severed, they got bits and pieces of each other's visions. After the holocrons were destroyed, Maul discovered another way to get the information he needed. He travels to Dathomir with Ezra, and recreates a Nightsister spell to temporarily meld his and Ezra's minds. After this is completed, Ezra and Maul realize that they are both looking for Obi-Wan Kenobi.\n\nIn the episode \"Twin Suns\", Maul is shown lost on Tatooine. He decides to use Ezra to lure Obi-Wan out of hiding. His plan is ultimately successful as he tracks Ezra through the desert and the latter is rescued by Obi-Wan. Maul then comes face to face with his nemesis who ushered Ezra away. During their confrontation, Maul deduces that Obi-Wan is not only hiding, but is protecting [[Luke Skywalker|someone]]. Obi-Wan realizes Maul has to die and ignites his lightsaber. In a swift duel, Obi-Wan fatally wounds Maul. As he lies dying in Obi-Wan's arms, Maul asks if the person he is protecting is the [[Chosen One (Star Wars)|Chosen One]], and Obi-Wan (implying Luke as Anakin has since become Vader) replies that he is. Maul declares that this \"Chosen One\" will avenge them and dies.\n\n===Comics===\n{{Expand section|date=June 2019}}\n\n====''Darth Maul''====\nIn 2017, [[Marvel Comics|Marvel]] released ''Star Wars: Darth Maul'' a 5-issue prequel series centered on Darth Maul before the events of ''The Phantom Menace''.<ref>{{cite web|last=Juba |first=Joe |url=http://www.gameinformer.com/b/news/archive/2016/11/14/darth-maul-to-star-in-new-comic-book.aspx |title=Darth Maul To Star In New Star Wars Comic Book - News |publisher=www.GameInformer.com |date=2016-11-14 |accessdate=2016-12-19}}</ref>\n\n====''Darth Maul: Son of Dathomir''====\n[[Dark Horse Comics]] produced ''[[Darth Maul: Son of Dathomir]]'' based on the scripts and storyboards of an unproduced 4-episode story arc intended for ''The Clone Wars'' Season 7. After killing Savage Opress, Darth Sidious takes Maul to a Separatist prison, where [[Count Dooku]] tortures him for information about the Shadow Collective. Prime Minister Almec arranges Maul's escape and the latter then heads back to Zanbar to command the Death Watch army. However, he is followed by [[General Grievous]] and his droids, who battle with Maul and the Mandalorians. While they put up a fierce fight, Maul and his minions are ultimately overwhelmed by the droids. During the battle, Maul tears through the droid ranks and attacks Grievous, but is overpowered and forced to retreat. Afterwards, Maul confers with Mother Talzin (revealed to be his biological mother) and plots to draw out Sidious by capturing Dooku and Grievous. The scheme works, and Talzin is able to restore herself to her physical form, but she sacrifices herself to save Maul. Although Maul escapes with a company of loyal Mandalorians, the Shadow Collective has disintegrated due to the conflict with Sidious, as the Hutts, Pykes, and Black Sun have all abandoned Maul.\n\n===Novels===\n====''Ahsoka''====\nIn flashbacks during the novel ''[[Star Wars: Ahsoka]]'', it is revealed that during the final days of the Clone Wars, Maul and his forces were besieged on Mandalore by an army of clone troopers led by Ahsoka Tano and [[Captain Rex]].{{efn|Anakin and Obi-Wan were dispatched to Mandalore with Ahsoka, but were immediately called back to Coruscant to rescue Chancellor [[Palpatine]], thus leading into the opening sequence of ''Revenge of the Sith''.}} During the siege, Maul confronts and duels Ahsoka, and though he proves to be the stronger fighter, the former Jedi outwits him and traps him in a ray shield. However, before Maul can be taken into official custody, [[Order 66 (Star Wars)|Order 66]] is enacted and the clone troopers following Ahsoka turn on her, with the exception of Rex. With Rex's life in peril, Ahsoka abandons the chance of killing Maul, allowing the former Sith to escape once again.

The series is set in the shortly before the Battle of Naboo in ''Episode I \u2013 The Phantom Menace''.  The story follows Maul in his mission to destroy the leadership of the well-feared crime syndicate Black Sun. Maul spends his time serving under Darth Sidious, killing countlessly. His main target in the series is the leader of Black Sun, some time before [[Prince Xizor]] takes command of it.\n\nSeveral sources depict Maul returning from the dead in several different forms. The story \"Resurrection\" from [[Star Wars Tales 9|''Star Wars Tales'' #9]] depicts a cult creating a duplicate of Maul as a replacement for Darth Vader, only for Vader to kill him. The story ''Phantom Menaces'' in [[Star Wars Tales 17|''Star Wars Tales'' #17]] (set after ''[[Return of the Jedi]]'') depicts Luke Skywalker visiting Maul's home planet of [[Iridonia]] in an ambassadorial capacity, where he faces a \"solid state hologram\" of Maul projected from Maul's salvaged brain as part of a scientist's attempt to recreate Maul as Iridonia's \"champion\". Luke recognizes the disruption that Maul's existence is causing in the Force, and shuts down the life-support systems keeping the brain alive.\n\nIn 2005, Dark Horse Comics published ''[[Star Wars: Visionaries]]'', a compilation of non-canonical short comics made by the creators of ''Revenge of the Sith''. One story, \"Old Wounds\", depicts Maul with longer horns on his head, having survived his bisection at Obi-Wan's hands, with his missing bottom half replaced with [[cybernetic]] legs, similar to those of General Grievous (and his eventual revival in ''The Clone Wars''). He follows Obi-Wan throughout the galaxy, finally tracking him down on Tatooine a few years after the events of ''Revenge of the Sith''. Maul taunts Obi-Wan, saying that after he kills him, he will take a toddler-aged Luke Skywalker to his master, Emperor Palpatine. Maul plans to kill Vader and resume his rightful place at Palpatine's side. He ignites his new double-bladed lightsaber and engages Obi-Wan in a duel, but Obi-Wan again bests him in combat, cutting off his opponent's horns. Maul is killed by a blaster bolt to the head from [[Owen Lars]]. Obi-Wan thanks Owen, and says he will take Maul's body into the desert and burn it.\n\n====Novels====\nIn early 2012, a [[young adult fiction|young adult]] novel entitled ''Star Wars: The Wrath of Darth Maul'' was released by [[Scholastic Corporation|Scholastic]]. Maul is also featured prominently in comic series starting in this period, ''The Clone Wars: The Sith Hunters'' and ''Darth Maul: Death Sentence''. Set around the various episodes of ''The Clone Wars'' that featured Maul, the two books detail his and Savage Opress' journey across the galaxy as they seek vengeance on the Jedi.\n\nIn the 2012 novel ''[[Star Wars: Darth Plagueis|Darth Plagueis]]'', the titular Sith lord sends his apprentice, Darth Sidious, to the Force-rich world of Dathomir. A Dathomiri witch, or Nightsister, senses Sidious' power in the Force and approaches him. Assuming he is a Jedi, she begs him to take her [[Zabrak (Star Wars)|Zabrak]] infant son. She realizes that Sidious is not a Jedi, and explains how she is trying to save her son from a Nightsister named Talzin, who killed Maul's father. It is implied that Maul has a twin brother and that Talzin is only aware of one child. Sidious realizes the infant is strong in the Force, and would become a threat if found by the Jedi. Concealing the existence of his own master, Sidious raises Maul to believe that he is a Sith apprentice, but he actually intends him to be an expendable minion rather than an heir. Maul himself acknowledges his shortcomings, such as his limited understanding of politics, even as he tries to become a true Sith.\n\n=====''Darth Maul: Shadow Hunter''=====\n'''''Darth Maul: Shadow Hunter''''' is a novel by [[Michael Reaves]] released on February 1, 2001. It is a prequel novel occurring about six months before the events of ''The Phantom Menace''. The cover art was by David Stevenson. [[Del Rey Books|Del Rey]] aired a TV commercial for the novel in 1999.{{citation needed|date=September 2019}} As portrayed in the novel, Maul was raised by Sidious for as long as he can remember. Sidious then trains Maul as a Sith, marking his body with Sith tattoos. Maul initially goes on several missions of [[terrorism|terror]] for his master, killing politicians, crime bosses, merchants and warlords.\n\nSidious meets secretly with his [[Neimoidian]] contacts in the Trade Federation to finalize details in the plan to blockade Naboo. One member of the delegation is missing; suspecting betrayal, Sidious orders Maul to hunt down the traitor. Maul completes this task, but learns that the traitor had recorded proof of the Sith's manipulation of the Naboo blockade on a holocron to sell for profit. A [[suicide terrorism|suicidal]] attack by a Trade Federation-hired [[bounty hunter]] interferes with Maul's plan and the holocron is purchased by a [[Corellia]]n con man named Lorn Pavan.\nPavan realizes the nature of the information and seeks to take it to the [[Jedi Temple]]. Maul, for his part, is ordered by Sidious to retrieve the holocron and kill Pavan and anyone else who might have the information.  Meanwhile, a Jedi Padawan named Darsha Assant is faced with the Jedi trials to become a full-fledged Jedi Knight, and tries to save a member of Black Sun (which Maul had crippled in ''Saboteur'').\n\nPavan attempts to do business with a Hutt crime lord in one of the lower levels in Coruscant, but Maul arrives and kills the Hutt. Pavan escapes into the caverns where they meet Darsha and her master. The Jedi begin escorting Pavan and his droid to the temple but Maul soon attacks them. Darsha's master is slain while attempting to buy time for the others. Pavan and Darsha escape various dangers of Coruscant's subterranean levels before finding themselves in another battle.  Darsha, realizing that she cannot defeat Maul, draws out their duel long enough for Pavan's droid to repair a carbonite-freezing unit and seal Pavan and the droid inside it.  Darsha plunges her lightsaber into a pile of volatile gas canisters, killing her and causing an explosion that Maul barely escapes.  Upon surveying the scene, Maul feels no trace of Pavan in the Force, not realizing that the [[Carbonite (Star Wars)|carbonite]] [[hibernation]] has made his lifeforce undetectable.\n\nAn automatic timer frees Pavan from hibernation and he goes after Maul on his own.  Pavan follows Maul to a Republic space station and sneaks up on Maul, stunning him momentarily before he awakens, severes Pavan's right hand, and pursues him through the station's service tubes.\nPavan barely makes it into a public area where Maul cannot follow, and unwittingly gives the holocron to Senator Palpatine of Naboo, not realizing that Palpatine is Maul's Sith Master. After recovering, Pavan starts to leave his quarters, only to be confronted by Maul, who kills him as a worthy opponent.\n\n=====''Darth Maul: Saboteur''=====\n'''''Darth Maul: Saboteur''''' is a short story by [[James Luceno]]. It was released in [[ebook]] form, with a length equivalent to about 55 printed pages, on February 1, 2001.\nIt was also published in the back of the paperback edition of Michael Reaves' ''Darth Maul: Shadow Hunter''.\n\nThe story is about Darth Maul and takes place roughly a year before ''The Phantom Menace''. It recounts Maul's first solo mission and attempt to destroy two mining companies so the Trade Federation can take them over.\n\n=====''Maul: Lockdown''=====\n'''''Maul: Lockdown''''' is a ''Star Wars'' novel written by [[Joe Schreiber]], released by Del Rey Books on January 28, 2014.<ref>{{cite web |last=Anders |first=Charlie Jane |title=The guy who put zombies in the ''Star Wars'' universe is sending Darth Maul behind bars |url=http://io9.com/5978549/the-guy-who-put-zombies-in-the-star-wars-universe-is-sending-darth-maul-behind-bars |publisher=[[io9]] |date=January 24, 2013 |accessdate=July 15, 2016}}</ref> It was the last novel to be released in the ''Star Wars Legends'' line of the franchise.<ref name=\"SW Legends\"/><ref name=\"THR Legends\">{{cite news |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/lucasfilm-unveils-new-plans-star-698973|last=McMilian|first=Graeme|title=Lucasfilm Unveils New Plans for ''Star Wars Expanded Universe''|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=April 25, 2014|accessdate=May 26, 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"SW Adult\"/> Before the events of ''The Phantom Menace'', Sith lords [[Darth Plagueis]] and Darth Sidious send their disciple Darth Maul to a galactic prison to recover a powerful weapon.

The company\u2019s roots are deep in the Finnish countryside and Finnish work, but nowadays the company is quite involved in the international market. Today, Ponsse's machines are used at logging sites in approximately 40 countries, and 80 per cent of the company\u2019s net sales come from exports.<ref>https://issuu.com/ponsseplc/docs/ponsse_news_1_2019_fin\n</ref> All machines are manufactured in the company\u2019s birthplace in [[Vierem\u00e4]].

He decides to set up a forest machine factory in [[Vierem\u00e4]]. However, help is required by the municipality of Vierem\u00e4 in order to finance the project. A meeting is held by the municipal council, and they vote on the matter. The council approves the proposal with a majority of a single vote. The work is completed by the end of 1970, and Ponsse Plc is established as a result. <ref>https://issuu.com/ponsseplc/docs/ponsse_news_special_edition_en_issuu2_2.2020/37</ref>\n\nIn 1971, Einari places an ad in the [[Helsingin Sanomat]] news paper in order to recruit an engineer for the factory. An application by Jouko Kelppe, a young engineer from [[Salo]], attracts the most attention. Jouko is hired to be the first ever engineer in the history of Ponsse. The manufacturing of the first machine is started in the spring of 1971. A forest machine contractor Eero Vainikainen is in the process of purchasing a [[Volvo]] or [[Valmet]] machine. However, after strong persuasion and visiting the Ponsse factory, he decides to buy the first ever Ponsse machine. The machine is driven out of the factory by Einari in the autumn of 1971. <ref>https://starjournalnow.com/2019/06/11/ponsse-historical-timeline/</ref>\n\nPonsse premieres in the international markets in 1974. A massive storm hits [[Germany]], and a large number of foreign equipment is needed for harvesting the trees felled by the storm.

The public demands lighter and more eco-friendly machines. Ponsse releases a new model S 15 [[forwarder]] in 1983.

He wants Ponsse to make their own harvester heads. The first product, H520 is not completely trouble-free, and causes many problems for the company. Learning from these mistakes, a new model called H60 is released at the end of 1985. This marks an important step in the expansion of the product family. <ref>https://issuu.com/ponsseplc/docs/ponsse_news_1_2019_fin</ref>\n\nOn 16th of December in 1988, Ponsse's entire share capital is transferred to the industrial company called Interpolator Oy, a part of SKOP Group. This makes Ponsse a part of Norcar Group, along with some earlier acquisitions. Einari becomes a board member of Norcar Group, and Einari's brother, Esa Vidgren, is appointed as the managing director of Ponsse Plc. <ref>https://www.hs.fi/kuukausiliite/art-2000006124591.html</ref>\n\n===1990s - Globalization, Einari buys Ponsse back===\n\nThe computerized Kajaani 2000 loader control system represents the latest trend in the product development of forest machine control systems.

A leading figure of pre-[[World War II]] [[Flemish nationalism]], he co-founded the extreme-right group [[Verdinaso]].\n[[File:Joris Van Severen.jpg|{{largethumb}}|Van Severen delivering a speech]]\n\n==Early years==\nVan Severen was born in the [[Flanders|Flemish]] town of [[Wakken]] as '''Georges Edmond Eduard Van Severen'''.<ref name=\"R401\"/> His family was Flemish but, in keeping with a number of leading Flemings, spoke the [[French language]] and as such were given the derogatory nickname ''Fransquillon'' by [[Dutch language|Dutch]] speakers.<ref name=\"R401\"/> Van Severen's father was a prominent lawyer who also served as mayor of Wakken.<ref name=\"R401\"/> Van Severen was educated by [[Jesuit]]s in the [[Sint-Barbaracollege]], who taught in French, before studying law at the [[University of Ghent]].<ref name=\"R401\"/>\n\nFollowing the outbreak of the [[First World War]] Van Severen was called up to the [[Belgian Army]]. Initially a sergeant, he was promoted to second lieutenant in January 1917.<ref name=\"R401\"/> While in the army Van Severen became part of the ''Front Beweging'', a secret Flemish nationalist group active within the Belgian Army, and also wrote an open letter to [[Albert I of Belgium|King Albert]] calling for greater autonomy for Flanders.<ref name=\"R401\">[[Philip Rees]], ''[[Biographical Dictionary of the Extreme Right Since 1890]]'', Simon & Schuster, 1991, p. 401</ref> The latter, which was the work of Van Severen and other intellectual soldiers such as Corporal Adiel de Beuckelaere, included calls for internal self-government and a separate Flemish Army.<ref>F.L. Carsten, ''The Rise of Fascism'', London: Methuen & Co, 1974, p. 207</ref> When this was discovered Van Severen was interrogated by Military Police about his Flemish nationalist activities and after informing them that he was supported the terms of the letter he was sentenced to eight days of house arrest.<ref>De Bruyne, A., ''Joris Van Severen, Droom & Daad'', Oranje Uitgaven, 1961</ref> His ultimate punishment was to be demoted back into the ranks in June 1918.<ref name=\"R401\"/>\n\n==Political development==\nAlready involved in the Flemish Movement, Van Severen began to develop his own wider [[ideology]] and world view. Towards the end of the war he became a convinced [[Russophilia|Russophile]] and reacted positively towards the [[Russian Revolution]].<ref name=\"R401\"/> He combined this with a strong [[Germanophobia]], dismissing [[Germany]] as \"a gang of bandits with no soul\".<ref name=\"R401\"/> Alongside this he had a strong faith in the [[Roman Catholic Church]], and in particular admired the Catholic authors [[L\u00e9on Bloy]] and [[Albrecht Rodenbach]], who was also an important figure of inspiration for the Flemish Movement.<ref>Rees, ''Biographical Dictionary of the Extreme Right'', pp. 401-402</ref> His ideas began to take shape in the journal ''Ons Vaterland'', which Van Severen and other like-minded soldiers produced from the front.<ref name=\"R402\">Rees, ''Biographical Dictionary of the Extreme Right'', p. 402</ref>\n\nDemobilised after the war, Van Severen returned to his studies at Ghent University, where he was chosen as president of the General Flemish Student Union.<ref name=\"R402\"/> In 1921 he became editor of the journal ''Ter Waarheid'' and in this role his ideological outlook developed further as he shifted to the right. Although he had always been a nationalist Van Severen had held some respect for international [[socialism]] but by the early 1920s had abandoned this position in favour of a harder-edged nationalist [[Jacobinism]].<ref name=\"R402\"/>\n\n==Frontpartij==\nThe only major political outlet for Flemish nationalism after the First World War was the [[Frontpartij]] and Van Severen duly joined this group.

A leading figure of pre-[[World War II]] [[Flemish nationalism]], he co-founded the extreme-right group [[Verdinaso]].\n[[File:Joris Van Severen.jpg|{{largethumb}}|Van Severen delivering a speech]]\n\n==Early years==\nVan Severen was born in the [[Flanders|Flemish]] town of [[Wakken]] as '''Georges Edmond Eduard Van Severen'''.<ref name=\"R401\"/> His family was Flemish but, in keeping with a number of leading Flemings, spoke the [[French language]] and as such were given the derogatory nickname ''Fransquillon'' by [[Dutch language|Dutch]] speakers.<ref name=\"R401\"/> Van Severen's father was a prominent lawyer who also served as mayor of Wakken.<ref name=\"R401\"/> Van Severen was educated by [[Jesuit]]s in the [[Sint-Barbaracollege]], who taught in French, before studying law at the [[University of Ghent]].<ref name=\"R401\"/>\n\nFollowing the outbreak of the [[First World War]] Van Severen was called up to the [[Belgian Army]]. Initially a sergeant, he was promoted to second lieutenant in January 1917.<ref name=\"R401\"/> While in the army Van Severen became part of the ''Front Beweging'', a secret Flemish nationalist group active within the Belgian Army, and also wrote an open letter to [[Albert I of Belgium|King Albert]] calling for greater autonomy for Flanders.<ref name=\"R401\">[[Philip Rees]], ''[[Biographical Dictionary of the Extreme Right Since 1890]]'', Simon & Schuster, 1991, p. 401</ref> The latter, which was the work of Van Severen and other intellectual soldiers such as Corporal Adiel de Beuckelaere, included calls for internal self-government and a separate Flemish Army.<ref>F.L. Carsten, ''The Rise of Fascism'', London: Methuen & Co, 1974, p. 207</ref> When this was discovered Van Severen was interrogated by Military Police about his Flemish nationalist activities and after informing them that he was supported the terms of the letter he was sentenced to eight days of house arrest.<ref>De Bruyne, A., ''Joris Van Severen, Droom & Daad'', Oranje Uitgaven, 1961</ref> His ultimate punishment was to be demoted back into the ranks in June 1918.<ref name=\"R401\"/>\n\n==Political development==\nAlready involved in the Flemish Movement, Van Severen began to develop his own wider [[ideology]] and world view. Towards the end of the war he became a convinced [[Russophilia|Russophile]] and reacted positively towards the [[Russian Revolution]].<ref name=\"R401\"/> He combined this with a strong [[Germanophobia]], dismissing [[Germany]] as \"a gang of bandits with no soul\".<ref name=\"R401\"/> Alongside this he had a strong faith in the [[Roman Catholic Church]], and in particular admired the Catholic authors [[L\u00e9on Bloy]] and [[Albrecht Rodenbach]], who was also an important figure of inspiration for the Flemish Movement.<ref>Rees, ''Biographical Dictionary of the Extreme Right'', pp. 401-402</ref> His ideas began to take shape in the journal ''Ons Vaterland'', which Van Severen and other like-minded soldiers produced from the front.<ref name=\"R402\">Rees, ''Biographical Dictionary of the Extreme Right'', p. 402</ref>\n\nDemobilised after the war, Van Severen returned to his studies at Ghent University, where he was chosen as president of the General Flemish Student Union.<ref name=\"R402\"/> In 1921 he became editor of the journal ''Ter Waarheid'' and in this role his ideological outlook developed further as he shifted to the right. Although he had always been a nationalist Van Severen had held some respect for international [[socialism]] but by the early 1920s had abandoned this position in favour of a harder-edged nationalist [[Jacobinism]].<ref name=\"R402\"/>\n\n==Frontpartij==\nThe only major political outlet for Flemish nationalism after the First World War was the [[Frontpartij]] and Van Severen duly joined this group. A candidate for the [[Roeselare]]-[[Tielt]] seat in the [[1921 Belgian general election|1921 general election]] he was successful in gaining election to the [[Belgian Chamber of Representatives]] that year.<ref name=\"R402\"/> As a member of the Chamber he supported a policy of \"flemicization\", encouraging the appointment of Flemings to leading roles in the judiciary, government, armed forces and other public institutions.<ref name=\"R402\"/> As a parliamentarian he gained a reputation as a fiery and committed polemicist, although equally he was wont to lose interest and simply read passages from [[Charles P\u00e9guy]] in the Chamber instead of making speeches.<ref name=\"R402\"/> His shift to the right continued apace as his most admired political philosophers became [[Maurice Barr\u00e8s]] and [[Charles Maurras]].<ref name=\"R402\"/>\n\nVan Severen lost his seat in the [[1929 Belgian general election|1929 general election]] and, by then publicly expressing admiration for [[Benito Mussolini]] and [[Italian fascism]], he established his own journal, ''Jong Dietschland''.

These influences have led to the planting of these varieties, sometimes only in small quantities, in turn increasing the range of wines in the market, and offering winemakers more alternatives for use in the blending process. These include [[Barber]], [[Arneis]], [[Fiano (grape)|Fiano]], [[Gr\u00fcner Veltliner]], [[Lagrein]], [[Nebbiolo]], [[Sangiovese]], [[Saperavi]] [[Tannat]], [[Tempranillo]], [[Vermentino]] and so on, all of which are dealt with below. (See '''List of Grape Varieties''')<ref>For a detailed exploration of Australia rare varieties, see Higgs, Darby. \"Alternative Wine Grape Varieties in Australia.\" Vinodiversity.[https://www.vinodiversity.com/varieties.html] Accessed 5 March 2020.</ref> \n\nAs Jancis Robinson said, \"This is an exciting time for Australian viticulture.\"<ref>Robinson, ''Vines, Grapes & Wines,'' p. 50.</ref>\n\n\n==Overview==\nAustralia's [[Viticulture|grape growing]] and [[winemaking]] sectors and the related [[Enotourism|wine tourism]] sector are spread across all six states, [[South Australia]], [[New South Wales]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], [[Western Australia]], [[Tasmania]] and [[Queensland]] (see [[Australian wine]]). These activities are concentrated in the southern part of the continent and only where the ''[[terroir]]'' - that is, [[Soil|soil types]], [[Microclimate|local climate]], [[Irrigation|availability of irrigation]] and so on - is suited to viticulture.<ref>Jones, Gregory. \"Climate, Grapes, and Wine: Terroir and the Importance of Climate to Winegrape Production.\" GuildSomm, 2015.[https://www.guildsomm.com/public_content/features/articles/b/gregory_jones/posts/climate-grapes-and-wine] Accessed 20 March 2020.</ref><ref>The relevance of environmental issues and climate change to Australia's industry is dealt with in Wine Australia. \"Environment and climate.\"[https://www.wineaustralia.com/growing-making/environment-and-climate] Accessed 17 March 2020.</ref> \n\nMany grape growers are also winemakers and some, especially smaller businesses, use only the output of vines on their own properties to make their wines. Other growers sell their entire grape output to winemakers. This means that a large number of winemakers use the output from their own vineyards along with buying from other growers for use in blending. Summarising this succinctly, James Halliday wrote:<blockquote>\"It isn't feasible to determine whether \u2026 a grower supplies multiple wineries, but is not itself a winemaker, or whether a winemaker makes wine for itself as well as selling wine or grapes to other winemakers.\"<ref>Halliday, James. ''Varietal Wine: A guide to 130 varieties grown in Australia and their place in the international landscape''. Hardie Grant Books, 2015. p. xix. {{ISBN|1-74270-860-9}}</ref></blockquote> \n\nGiven the size of the Australian continent and the distances between winemaking regions, road transportation plays a major role in the day-to-day operation of the wine industry. Jancis Robinson saw this with some irony:<blockquote>\"The importance of trucking should not be underestimated. The typical large winery is probably based in South Australia, often in the Barossa, but will buy in grapes from as far afield as Coonawarra, the irrigated interior and possibly even the Hunter Valley in New South Wales. (Conversely, it has been a source of persistent irritation to South Australians that they have long provided so much fruit to bolster the reputations of wineries based in New South Wales.)\"<ref>Robinson, Jancis. \"Australia.\" ''Wine Regions.'' par. 8.[https://www.jancisrobinson.com/learn/wine-regions/australia] Accessed 7 March 2020.)</ref></blockquote>\n\n===Output and value===\nThe total wine output for the 2018-2019 financial year was 1.2 billion litres made up of 684 million litres of red (57% of the total) with the remaining 43% or 514 million litres being white. In that same period, the total sales were 1.3 billion litres valued at AUD$6.36 billion with local consumption being 38% or 494 million litres valued at AUD$3.5 billion and exports of 62% or 801 million litres being valued at AUD$2.9 billion.<ref name=2019ataglance>Wine Australia. \"Australian wine sector 2019 at a glance.\" Wine Australia, 2020.[https://www.wineaustralia.com/market-insights/australian-wine-sector-at-a-glance].

This 2019 adjustment meant that the average winegrape purchase price increased, with red grapes well ahead of whites, and this will flow through to the market price of the wines.\n\nDue to various factors, including changes in the average temperature, rainfall, humidity and so on, each wine-producing nation's output fluctuates from year to year, but Australia has usually managed to maintain its position around 5th or 6th in the world.<ref>One report showed Australia in 2018 as sixth in wine production behind Italy, France, Spain, the United States and Argentina (Statista. \"Wine production in selected countries and regions.\" 2019.[https://www.statista.com/statistics/240638/wine-production-in-selected-countries-and-regions/] Accessed 20 March 2020.</ref> However, there have been two recent reports carrying conflicting information about Australia's ranking in 2019.

They were followed by the United States (US) 153 million litres, contributing AU$432 million or 15% of export value, the lower value being because they bought more unpackaged than bottled wine. The United Kingdon was just behind the US taking 236 million litres and paid AU$373 million or14% of the export value.

These influences have led to the planting of these varieties, sometimes only in small quantities, in turn increasing the range of wines in the market, and offering winemakers more alternatives for use in the blending process. These include [[Barber]], [[Arneis]], [[Fiano (grape)|Fiano]], [[Gr\u00fcner Veltliner]], [[Lagrein]], [[Nebbiolo]], [[Sangiovese]], [[Saperavi]] [[Tannat]], [[Tempranillo]], [[Vermentino]] and so on, all of which are dealt with below. (See '''List of Grape Varieties''')<ref>For a detailed exploration of Australia rare varieties, see Higgs, Darby. \"Alternative Wine Grape Varieties in Australia.\" Vinodiversity.[https://www.vinodiversity.com/varieties.html] Accessed 5 March 2020.</ref> \n\nAs Jancis Robinson said, \"This is an exciting time for Australian viticulture.\"<ref>Robinson, ''Vines, Grapes & Wines,'' p. 50.</ref>\n\n\n==Overview==\nAustralia's [[Viticulture|grape growing]] and [[winemaking]] sectors and the related [[Enotourism|wine tourism]] sector are spread across all six states, [[South Australia]], [[New South Wales]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], [[Western Australia]], [[Tasmania]] and [[Queensland]] (see [[Australian wine]]). These activities are concentrated in the southern part of the continent and only where the ''[[terroir]]'' - that is, [[Soil|soil types]], [[Microclimate|local climate]], [[Irrigation|availability of irrigation]] and so on - is suited to viticulture.<ref>Jones, Gregory. \"Climate, Grapes, and Wine: Terroir and the Importance of Climate to Winegrape Production.\" GuildSomm, 2015.[https://www.guildsomm.com/public_content/features/articles/b/gregory_jones/posts/climate-grapes-and-wine] Accessed 20 March 2020.</ref><ref>The relevance of environmental issues and climate change to Australia's industry is dealt with in Wine Australia. \"Environment and climate.\"[https://www.wineaustralia.com/growing-making/environment-and-climate] Accessed 17 March 2020.</ref> \n\nMany grape growers are also winemakers and some, especially smaller businesses, use only the output of vines on their own properties to make their wines. Other growers sell their entire grape output to winemakers. This means that a large number of winemakers use the output from their own vineyards along with buying from other growers for use in blending. Summarising this succinctly, James Halliday wrote:<blockquote>\"It isn't feasible to determine whether \u2026 a grower supplies multiple wineries, but is not itself a winemaker, or whether a winemaker makes wine for itself as well as selling wine or grapes to other winemakers.\"<ref>Halliday, James. ''Varietal Wine: A guide to 130 varieties grown in Australia and their place in the international landscape''. Hardie Grant Books, 2015. p. xix. {{ISBN|1-74270-860-9}}</ref></blockquote> \n\nGiven the size of the Australian continent and the distances between winemaking regions, road transportation plays a major role in the day-to-day operation of the wine industry. Jancis Robinson saw this with some irony:<blockquote>\"The importance of trucking should not be underestimated. The typical large winery is probably based in South Australia, often in the Barossa, but will buy in grapes from as far afield as Coonawarra, the irrigated interior and possibly even the Hunter Valley in New South Wales. (Conversely, it has been a source of persistent irritation to South Australians that they have long provided so much fruit to bolster the reputations of wineries based in New South Wales.)\"<ref>Robinson, Jancis. \"Australia.\" ''Wine Regions.'' par. 8.[https://www.jancisrobinson.com/learn/wine-regions/australia] Accessed 7 March 2020.)</ref></blockquote>\n\n===Output and value===\nThe total wine output for the 2018-2019 financial year was 1.2 billion litres made up of 684 million litres of red (57% of the total) with the remaining 43% or 514 million litres being white. In that same period, the total sales were 1.3 billion litres valued at AUD$6.36 billion with local consumption being 38% or 494 million litres valued at AUD$3.5 billion and exports of 62% or 801 million litres being valued at AUD$2.9 billion.<ref name=2019ataglance>Wine Australia. \"Australian wine sector 2019 at a glance.\" Wine Australia, 2020.[https://www.wineaustralia.com/market-insights/australian-wine-sector-at-a-glance].

This 2019 adjustment meant that the average winegrape purchase price increased, with red grapes well ahead of whites, and this will flow through to the market price of the wines.\n\nDue to various factors, including changes in the average temperature, rainfall, humidity and so on, each wine-producing nation's output fluctuates from year to year, but Australia has usually managed to maintain its position around 5th or 6th in the world.<ref>One report showed Australia in 2018 as sixth in wine production behind Italy, France, Spain, the United States and Argentina (Statista. \"Wine production in selected countries and regions.\" 2019.[https://www.statista.com/statistics/240638/wine-production-in-selected-countries-and-regions/] Accessed 20 March 2020.</ref> However, there have been two recent reports carrying conflicting information about Australia's ranking in 2019.

They were followed by the United States (US) 153 million litres, contributing AU$432 million or 15% of export value, the lower value being because they bought more unpackaged than bottled wine. The United Kingdon was just behind the US taking 236 million litres and paid AU$373 million or14% of the export value. In the UK's case, they were the largest buyer of unpackaged wine having purchased -14.4% less than in 2017-2018.<ref>A detailed report can be found at Gillespie, Rob, and Michael Clarke. \"Wine Making.\" ''Economic Contribution of the Australian Wine Sector 2019.'' pp. 5-9.
