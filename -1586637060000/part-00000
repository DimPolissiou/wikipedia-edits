They were in service from March to August 1918. When the guns were first employed, Parisians believed they had been bombed by a high-altitude [[Zeppelin]], as the sound of neither an aeroplane nor a gun could be heard. They were the largest pieces of artillery used during the war by barrel length, and qualify under the (later) formal definition of [[large-calibre artillery]].\n\nAlso called the \"''Kaiser Wilhelm Gesch\u00fctz''\" (\"[[Wilhelm II of Germany|Emperor William]] Gun\"), they were often confused with [[Big Bertha (howitzer)|Big Bertha]], the German [[howitzer]] used against the [[Li\u00e8ge (city)|Li\u00e8ge]] forts in 1914; indeed, the French called them by this name, as well.<ref group=\"Note\">For an instance of war-time naming of this gun as \"Big Bertha\", see {{cite news | title = Paris again Shelled by Long-Range Gun | newspaper = [[The New York Times]] | date = August 6, 1918 | page = 3 | format = PDF | url = https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1918/08/06/97014230.pdf | accessdate = 2011-12-03 }}</ref><ref name=\"ley196112\">{{Cite magazine\n |last=Ley\n |first=Willy\n |author=\n |last2=\n |first2=\n |date=December 1961\n |title=Dragons and Hot-Air Balloons\n |department=For Your Information\n |url=https://archive.org/stream/Galaxy_v20n02_1961-12_modified#page/n9/mode/1up\n |magazine=Galaxy Science Fiction\n |pages=79\u201389\n |type=\n}}</ref> They were also confused with the smaller \"[[Langer Max]]\" (Long Max) cannon, from which they were derived; although the famous [[Krupp]]-family artillery makers produced all these guns, the resemblance ended there.\n\nAs military weapons, the Paris Guns were not a great success: the payload was small, the barrel required frequent replacement, and the guns' accuracy was good enough for only city-sized targets. The German objective was to build a psychological weapon to attack the morale of the Parisians, not to destroy the city itself.\n\n==Description==\n[[File:George Eastman House - Bouvigny (French) - Emplacement d-une Bertha (pd).jpg|thumb|A Paris gun turntable mounting, as captured by United States forces near Ch\u00e2teau-Thierry, 1918 postcard]]\nDue to the weapon's apparent total destruction by the Germans in the face of the final Allied offensives, its capabilities are not known with full certainty. Figures stated for the weapon's size, range, and performance varied widely depending on the source\u2014not even the number of shells fired is certain. With the discovery (in the 1980s) and publication (in the Bull and Murphy book) of a long note on the gun written shortly before his death in 1926 by Dr. Fritz Rausenberger, who was in charge of its development at Krupp, the details of its design and capabilities were considerably clarified.\n\nThe gun was capable of firing a {{convert|106|kg|adj=on}}<ref name=bull />{{rp|120}} shell to a range of {{convert|130|km|mi|sp=us}} and a maximum altitude of {{convert|42.3|km|sp=us}}<ref name=bull />{{rp|120}}\u2014the greatest height reached by a human-made [[projectile]] until the first successful [[V-2 rocket|V-2]] flight test in October 1942. At the start of its 182-second trajectory,<ref name=bull />{{rp|33}} each shell from the Paris Gun reached a speed of {{convert|1640|m/s|ft/s|sp=us|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"bull\" />{{rp|33}} or {{Convert|5924|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}.\n\nSeven barrels were constructed. They used worn-out [[38 cm SK L/45 \"Max\"]] gun barrels that were fitted with an internal tube that reduced the caliber from {{Convert|380|mm|in|0|sp=us}} to {{Convert|210|mm|in|0|sp=us}}. The tube was {{Convert|21|m|ft|0|sp=us}} long and projected {{Convert|3.9|m|ft|0|sp=us}} out of the end of the gun, so an extension was bolted to the old gun-muzzle to cover and reinforce the lining tube. A further, 12-meter\u2013long smooth-bore extension was attached to the end of this, giving a total barrel length of {{Convert|34|m|ft|0|sp=us}}.<ref name=bull />{{rp|84}} This smooth section was intended to improve accuracy and reduce the dispersion of the shells, as it reduced the slight [[Yaw (rotation)|yaw]] a shell might have immediately after leaving the gun barrel produced by the gun's [[rifling]].<ref name=\"miller737\">Miller (1921) pg.737</ref> The barrel was braced to counteract barrel drop due to its length and weight, and vibrations while firing; it was mounted on a special rail-transportable carriage and fired from a prepared, concrete emplacement with a turntable. The original breech of the old 38&nbsp;cm gun did not require modification or reinforcement.\n\nSince it was based on a naval weapon, the gun was manned by a crew of 80 [[Kaiserliche Marine|Imperial Navy]] sailors under the command of Vice-Admiral Maximilian Rogge, chief of the Ordnance branch of the Admiralty.<ref name=bull />{{rp|66}} It was surrounded by several batteries of standard army artillery to create a \"noise-screen\" chorus around the big gun so that it could not be located by French and British spotters.\n\nThe projectile was flying significantly higher than projectiles from previous guns. Writer and journalist [[Adam Hochschild]] put it this way: \"It took about three minutes for each giant shell to cover the distance to the city, climbing to an altitude of {{convert|25|mi}} at the top of its trajectory. This was by far the highest point ever reached by a man-made object, so high that gunners, in calculating where the shells would land, had to take into account the rotation of the Earth. For the first time in warfare, deadly projectiles rained down on civilians from the stratosphere\".<ref>''To End All Wars'' by Adam Hochschild c. 2011 Adam Hochschild(Houghton, Mifflin Harcourt Publishing Company New York; 2011) pp.320 - 321</ref> This reduced drag from air resistance, allowing the shell to achieve a range of over {{Convert|130|km}}.\n\nThe unfinished [[V-3 cannon]] would have been able to fire larger projectiles to a longer range, and with a substantially higher rate of fire. The unfinished [[Project Babylon|Iraqi super gun]] would also have been substantially bigger.\n\n==Projectiles==\n[[File:Miller Paris Gun Shell diagrams.jpg|thumb|left|Post-war diagram of a Paris gun shell<ref>Miller (1921) pg.742</ref>]]\nThe Paris Gun [[shell (projectile)|shells]] weighed {{convert|106|kg|abbr=on|sp=us}}.<ref name=bull />{{rp|120}} The shells initially used had a diameter of {{convert|216|mm|abbr=on}} and a length of  {{convert|960|mm|abbr=on}}.<ref name=bull />{{rp|120}} The main body of the shell was composed of thick steel, containing {{convert|7|kg|abbr=on}} of [[TNT]].<ref name=bull />{{rp|120}}<ref group=\"Note\">This overall weight of Paris Gun shells is not atypical for artillery of this calibre. As a comparison, World War 1-era,  British [[BL 8-inch howitzer Mk VI \u2013 VIII|BL 8-inch howitzer]] fired a {{convert|91|kg|abbr=on}} high-explosive shell. The 210&nbsp;mm shell fired by the World War 2-era [[21 cm Kanone 39]] weighed {{convert|135|kg|abbr=on}} and contained {{convert|18.8|kg|abbr=on}} of explosives (13.9% by weight).</ref> The small amount of explosive \u2013 around 6.6% of the weight of the shell \u2013 meant that the effect of its shellburst was small for the shell's size.<ref name=Maitland>{{cite journal | author=Major J.

Each shell was sequentially numbered according to its increasing diameter, and had to be fired in numeric order, lest the projectile lodge in the bore and the gun explode. Also, when the shell was rammed into the gun, the chamber was precisely measured to determine the difference in its length: a few inches off would cause a great variance in the velocity, and with it, the range. Then, with the variance determined, the additional quantity of propellant was calculated, and its measure taken from a special car and added to the regular charge. After 65 rounds had been fired, each of progressively larger caliber to allow for wear, the barrel was sent back to Krupp and rebored to a caliber of {{convert|238|mm|abbr=on}} with a new set of shells.\n\nThe shell's explosive was contained in two compartments, separated by a wall. This strengthened the shell and supported the explosive charge under the acceleration of firing. One of the shell's two fuzes was mounted in the wall, with the other in the base of the shell. The fuzes proved very reliable as every single one of the 303 shells that landed in and around Paris successfully detonated.<ref>Miller (1921) pg.744</ref> The shell's nose was fitted with a streamlined, lightweight, ballistic cap \u2013 a highly unusual feature for the time \u2013 and the side had grooves that engaged with the [[rifling]] of the gun barrel, spinning the shell as it was fired so its flight was stable. Two copper [[driving band]]s provided a gas-tight seal against the gun barrel during firing.<ref name=Maitland />\n\n==Use in World War I==\n{{Location map+|France|float=right|width=200|alt=A map of France|caption=Location map|places=\n{{Location map~|France|lat=49.5|long=3.3|position=top|label=<div style=\"position: relative; top: -0.1em; right: -1.4em;\">Gun Site</div>}}\n{{Location map~|France|lat=48.85|long=2.35|position=left|label=<div style=\"position: relative; top: 1.0em; left: -0.5em;\">Paris</div>}}}}\n[[File:Paris Gun Shellls 1918.png|thumb|Map of central districts of Paris, showing where shells fired by the Paris Gun landed, June-August 1918, and a line indicating the direction of the German gun.

By the end of the day, military authorities were aware the shells were being fired from behind German lines by a new long-range gun, although there was initially press speculation on the origin of the shells. This included the theory they were being fired by German agents close by Paris, or even within the city itself, so abandoned quarries close to the city were searched for a hidden gun.<ref name=\"miller723\" /> The actual gun was found within days by the French air reconnaissance<ref name=\"miller728\">Miller (1921) pg.728</ref> aviator [[Didier Daurat]].\n\nThe Paris gun emplacement was dug out of the north side of the wooded hill at [[Coucy-le-Ch\u00e2teau-Auffrique]].<ref group=\"Note\">Position {{coord|49|31|40.43|N|3|18|17.57|E}}</ref> The gun was mounted on heavy steel rails embedded in concrete, facing Paris.\n\nThe Paris gun was used to shell Paris at a range of {{convert|120|km|mi|abbr=on}}. The distance was so far that the [[Coriolis effect]]\u2014the rotation of the Earth\u2014was substantial enough to affect trajectory calculations. The gun was fired at an azimuth of 232 degrees (west-southwest) from Cr\u00e9py-en-Laon, which was at a latitude of 49.5 degrees North.\n\nBetween 320 and 367 shells were fired, at a maximum rate of around 20 per day. The shells killed 250 people and wounded 620, and caused considerable damage to property.  The worst incident was on 29 March 1918, when a single shell hit the roof of the [[St-Gervais-et-St-Protais Church]], collapsing the roof on to the congregation then hearing the Good Friday service.  A total of 91 people were killed and 68 were wounded.\n\nThe gun was taken back to Germany in August 1918 as Allied advances threatened its security. No guns were ever captured by the Allies. It is believed that near the end of the war they were completely destroyed by the Germans. One spare mounting was captured by American troops in Bruy\u00e8res-sur-F\u00e8re, near [[Ch\u00e2teau-Thierry]], but the gun was never found; the construction plans seem to have been destroyed as well.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n44hAQAAMAAJ&lpg=PA937&ots=vLkDBl-s4n&dq=Big-Gun%20emplacement%20near%20Ch%C3%A2teau-Thierry&pg=PA937#v=onepage&q=Big-Gun%20emplacement%20near%20Ch%C3%A2teau-Thierry&f=false|title=Columbia Alumni News|last=|first=|publisher=Alumni Council of Columbia University (Vol. 10, No. 30)|year=1918|isbn=|location=|pages=937|quote=|via=}}</ref>\n\n==After World War I==\n[[File:210 mm Railway Gun.jpg|thumb|left|upright|A [[21 cm K 12 (E)|K12 railway gun]] elevated to the firing position]]\nUnder the terms of the [[Treaty of Versailles]], the Germans were required to turn over a complete Paris Gun to the Allies, but they never complied with this.<ref name=\"Venzon2013\">{{cite book|author=Anne Cipriano Venzon|title=The United States in the First World War: An Encyclopedia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0nhEAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA436|date=2 December 2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-135-68446-4|pages=436}}</ref>\n\nIn the 1930s, the German Army became interested in rockets for long-range artillery as a replacement for the Paris Gun\u2014which was specifically banned under the [[Versailles Treaty]]. This work would eventually led to the [[V-2 rocket]] that was used in [[World War II]].\n\nDespite the ban, Krupp continued theoretical work on long-range guns. They started experimental work after the Nazi government began funding the project upon coming to power in 1933. This research led to the [[21 cm K 12 (E)]], a refinement of the Paris Gun design concept.<ref>Ford (2000), p.116</ref> Although it was broadly similar in size and range to its predecessor, Krupp's engineers had significantly reduced the problem of barrel wear. They also improved mobility over the fixed Paris Gun by making the K12 a [[railway gun]].\n\nThe first K12 was delivered to the German Army in 1939 and a second in 1940. During World War II, they were deployed in the [[Nord-Pas-de-Calais]] region of France; they were used to shell [[Kent]] in Southern England between late 1940 and early 1941.

They were in service from March to August 1918. When the guns were first employed, Parisians believed they had been bombed by a high-altitude [[Zeppelin]], as the sound of neither an aeroplane nor a gun could be heard. They were the largest pieces of artillery used during the war by barrel length, and qualify under the (later) formal definition of [[large-calibre artillery]].\n\nAlso called the \"''Kaiser Wilhelm Gesch\u00fctz''\" (\"[[Wilhelm II of Germany|Emperor William]] Gun\"), they were often confused with [[Big Bertha (howitzer)|Big Bertha]], the German [[howitzer]] used against the [[Li\u00e8ge (city)|Li\u00e8ge]] forts in 1914; indeed, the French called them by this name, as well.<ref group=\"Note\">For an instance of war-time naming of this gun as \"Big Bertha\", see {{cite news | title = Paris again Shelled by Long-Range Gun | newspaper = [[The New York Times]] | date = August 6, 1918 | page = 3 | format = PDF | url = https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1918/08/06/97014230.pdf | accessdate = 2011-12-03 }}</ref><ref name=\"ley196112\">{{Cite magazine\n |last=Ley\n |first=Willy\n |author=\n |last2=\n |first2=\n |date=December 1961\n |title=Dragons and Hot-Air Balloons\n |department=For Your Information\n |url=https://archive.org/stream/Galaxy_v20n02_1961-12_modified#page/n9/mode/1up\n |magazine=Galaxy Science Fiction\n |pages=79\u201389\n |type=\n}}</ref> They were also confused with the smaller \"[[Langer Max]]\" (Long Max) cannon, from which they were derived; although the famous [[Krupp]]-family artillery makers produced all these guns, the resemblance ended there.\n\nAs military weapons, the Paris Guns were not a great success: the payload was small, the barrel required frequent replacement, and the guns' accuracy was good enough for only city-sized targets. The German objective was to build a psychological weapon to attack the morale of the Parisians, not to destroy the city itself.\n\n==Description==\n[[File:George Eastman House - Bouvigny (French) - Emplacement d-une Bertha (pd).jpg|thumb|A Paris gun turntable mounting, as captured by United States forces near Ch\u00e2teau-Thierry, 1918 postcard]]\nDue to the weapon's apparent total destruction by the Germans in the face of the final Allied offensives, its capabilities are not known with full certainty. Figures stated for the weapon's size, range, and performance varied widely depending on the source\u2014not even the number of shells fired is certain. With the discovery (in the 1980s) and publication (in the Bull and Murphy book) of a long note on the gun written shortly before his death in 1926 by Dr. Fritz Rausenberger, who was in charge of its development at Krupp, the details of its design and capabilities were considerably clarified.\n\nThe gun was capable of firing a {{convert|106|kg|adj=on}}<ref name=bull />{{rp|120}} shell to a range of {{convert|130|km|mi|sp=us}} and a maximum altitude of {{convert|42.3|km|sp=us}}<ref name=bull />{{rp|120}}\u2014the greatest height reached by a human-made [[projectile]] until the first successful [[V-2 rocket|V-2]] flight test in October 1942. At the start of its 182-second trajectory,<ref name=bull />{{rp|33}} each shell from the Paris Gun reached a speed of {{convert|1640|m/s|ft/s|sp=us|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"bull\" />{{rp|33}} or {{Convert|5924|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}.\n\nSeven barrels were constructed. They used worn-out [[38 cm SK L/45 \"Max\"]] gun barrels that were fitted with an internal tube that reduced the caliber from {{Convert|380|mm|in|0|sp=us}} to {{Convert|210|mm|in|0|sp=us}}. The tube was {{Convert|21|m|ft|0|sp=us}} long and projected {{Convert|3.9|m|ft|0|sp=us}} out of the end of the gun, so an extension was bolted to the old gun-muzzle to cover and reinforce the lining tube. A further, 12-meter\u2013long smooth-bore extension was attached to the end of this, giving a total barrel length of {{Convert|34|m|ft|0|sp=us}}.<ref name=bull />{{rp|84}} This smooth section was intended to improve accuracy and reduce the dispersion of the shells, as it reduced the slight [[Yaw (rotation)|yaw]] a shell might have immediately after leaving the gun barrel produced by the gun's [[rifling]].<ref name=\"miller737\">Miller (1921) pg.737</ref> The barrel was braced to counteract barrel drop due to its length and weight, and vibrations while firing; it was mounted on a special rail-transportable carriage and fired from a prepared, concrete emplacement with a turntable. The original breech of the old 38&nbsp;cm gun did not require modification or reinforcement.\n\nSince it was based on a naval weapon, the gun was manned by a crew of 80 [[Kaiserliche Marine|Imperial Navy]] sailors under the command of Vice-Admiral Maximilian Rogge, chief of the Ordnance branch of the Admiralty.<ref name=bull />{{rp|66}} It was surrounded by several batteries of standard army artillery to create a \"noise-screen\" chorus around the big gun so that it could not be located by French and British spotters.\n\nThe projectile was flying significantly higher than projectiles from previous guns. Writer and journalist [[Adam Hochschild]] put it this way: \"It took about three minutes for each giant shell to cover the distance to the city, climbing to an altitude of {{convert|25|mi}} at the top of its trajectory. This was by far the highest point ever reached by a man-made object, so high that gunners, in calculating where the shells would land, had to take into account the rotation of the Earth. For the first time in warfare, deadly projectiles rained down on civilians from the stratosphere\".<ref>''To End All Wars'' by Adam Hochschild c. 2011 Adam Hochschild(Houghton, Mifflin Harcourt Publishing Company New York; 2011) pp.320 - 321</ref> This reduced drag from air resistance, allowing the shell to achieve a range of over {{Convert|130|km}}.\n\nThe unfinished [[V-3 cannon]] would have been able to fire larger projectiles to a longer range, and with a substantially higher rate of fire. The unfinished [[Project Babylon|Iraqi super gun]] would also have been substantially bigger.\n\n==Projectiles==\n[[File:Miller Paris Gun Shell diagrams.jpg|thumb|left|Post-war diagram of a Paris gun shell<ref>Miller (1921) pg.742</ref>]]\nThe Paris Gun [[shell (projectile)|shells]] weighed {{convert|106|kg|abbr=on|sp=us}}.<ref name=bull />{{rp|120}} The shells initially used had a diameter of {{convert|216|mm|abbr=on}} and a length of  {{convert|960|mm|abbr=on}}.<ref name=bull />{{rp|120}} The main body of the shell was composed of thick steel, containing {{convert|7|kg|abbr=on}} of [[TNT]].<ref name=bull />{{rp|120}}<ref group=\"Note\">This overall weight of Paris Gun shells is not atypical for artillery of this calibre. As a comparison, World War 1-era,  British [[BL 8-inch howitzer Mk VI \u2013 VIII|BL 8-inch howitzer]] fired a {{convert|91|kg|abbr=on}} high-explosive shell. The 210&nbsp;mm shell fired by the World War 2-era [[21 cm Kanone 39]] weighed {{convert|135|kg|abbr=on}} and contained {{convert|18.8|kg|abbr=on}} of explosives (13.9% by weight).</ref> The small amount of explosive \u2013 around 6.6% of the weight of the shell \u2013 meant that the effect of its shellburst was small for the shell's size.<ref name=Maitland>{{cite journal | author=Major J.

Each shell was sequentially numbered according to its increasing diameter, and had to be fired in numeric order, lest the projectile lodge in the bore and the gun explode. Also, when the shell was rammed into the gun, the chamber was precisely measured to determine the difference in its length: a few inches off would cause a great variance in the velocity, and with it, the range. Then, with the variance determined, the additional quantity of propellant was calculated, and its measure taken from a special car and added to the regular charge. After 65 rounds had been fired, each of progressively larger caliber to allow for wear, the barrel was sent back to Krupp and rebored to a caliber of {{convert|238|mm|abbr=on}} with a new set of shells.\n\nThe shell's explosive was contained in two compartments, separated by a wall. This strengthened the shell and supported the explosive charge under the acceleration of firing. One of the shell's two fuzes was mounted in the wall, with the other in the base of the shell. The fuzes proved very reliable as every single one of the 303 shells that landed in and around Paris successfully detonated.<ref>Miller (1921) pg.744</ref> The shell's nose was fitted with a streamlined, lightweight, ballistic cap \u2013 a highly unusual feature for the time \u2013 and the side had grooves that engaged with the [[rifling]] of the gun barrel, spinning the shell as it was fired so its flight was stable. Two copper [[driving band]]s provided a gas-tight seal against the gun barrel during firing.<ref name=Maitland />\n\n==Use in World War I==\n{{Location map+|France|float=right|width=200|alt=A map of France|caption=Location map|places=\n{{Location map~|France|lat=49.5|long=3.3|position=top|label=<div style=\"position: relative; top: -0.1em; right: -1.4em;\">Gun Site</div>}}\n{{Location map~|France|lat=48.85|long=2.35|position=left|label=<div style=\"position: relative; top: 1.0em; left: -0.5em;\">Paris</div>}}}}\n[[File:Paris Gun Shellls 1918.png|thumb|Map of central districts of Paris, showing where shells fired by the Paris Gun landed, June-August 1918, and a line indicating the direction of the German gun.

By the end of the day, military authorities were aware the shells were being fired from behind German lines by a new long-range gun, although there was initially press speculation on the origin of the shells. This included the theory they were being fired by German agents close by Paris, or even within the city itself, so abandoned quarries close to the city were searched for a hidden gun.<ref name=\"miller723\" /> The actual gun was found within days by the French air reconnaissance<ref name=\"miller728\">Miller (1921) pg.728</ref> aviator [[Didier Daurat]].\n\nThe Paris gun emplacement was dug out of the north side of the wooded hill at [[Coucy-le-Ch\u00e2teau-Auffrique]].<ref group=\"Note\">Position {{coord|49|31|40.43|N|3|18|17.57|E}}</ref> The gun was mounted on heavy steel rails embedded in concrete, facing Paris.\n\nThe Paris gun was used to shell Paris at a range of {{convert|120|km|mi|abbr=on}}. The distance was so far that the [[Coriolis effect]]\u2014the rotation of the Earth\u2014was substantial enough to affect trajectory calculations. The gun was fired at an azimuth of 232 degrees (west-southwest) from Cr\u00e9py-en-Laon, which was at a latitude of 49.5 degrees North.\n\nBetween 320 and 367 shells were fired, at a maximum rate of around 20 per day. The shells killed 250 people and wounded 620, and caused considerable damage to property.  The worst incident was on 29 March 1918, when a single shell hit the roof of the [[St-Gervais-et-St-Protais Church]], collapsing the roof on to the congregation then hearing the Good Friday service.  A total of 91 people were killed and 68 were wounded.\n\nThe gun was taken back to Germany in August 1918 as Allied advances threatened its security. No guns were ever captured by the Allies. It is believed that near the end of the war they were completely destroyed by the Germans. One spare mounting was captured by American troops in Bruy\u00e8res-sur-F\u00e8re, near [[Ch\u00e2teau-Thierry]], but the gun was never found; the construction plans seem to have been destroyed as well.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n44hAQAAMAAJ&lpg=PA937&ots=vLkDBl-s4n&dq=Big-Gun%20emplacement%20near%20Ch%C3%A2teau-Thierry&pg=PA937#v=onepage&q=Big-Gun%20emplacement%20near%20Ch%C3%A2teau-Thierry&f=false|title=Columbia Alumni News|last=|first=|publisher=Alumni Council of Columbia University (Vol. 10, No. 30)|year=1918|isbn=|location=|pages=937|quote=|via=}}</ref>\n\n==After World War I==\n[[File:210 mm Railway Gun.jpg|thumb|left|upright|A [[21 cm K 12 (E)|K12 railway gun]] elevated to the firing position]]\nUnder the terms of the [[Treaty of Versailles]], the Germans were required to turn over a complete Paris Gun to the Allies, but they never complied with this.<ref name=\"Venzon2013\">{{cite book|author=Anne Cipriano Venzon|title=The United States in the First World War: An Encyclopedia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0nhEAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA436|date=2 December 2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-135-68446-4|pages=436}}</ref>\n\nIn the 1930s, the German Army became interested in rockets for long-range artillery as a replacement for the Paris Gun\u2014which was specifically banned under the [[Versailles Treaty]]. This work would eventually led to the [[V-2 rocket]] that was used in [[World War II]].\n\nDespite the ban, Krupp continued theoretical work on long-range guns. They started experimental work after the Nazi government began funding the project upon coming to power in 1933. This research led to the [[21 cm K 12 (E)]], a refinement of the Paris Gun design concept.<ref>Ford (2000), p.116</ref> Although it was broadly similar in size and range to its predecessor, Krupp's engineers had significantly reduced the problem of barrel wear. They also improved mobility over the fixed Paris Gun by making the K12 a [[railway gun]].\n\nThe first K12 was delivered to the German Army in 1939 and a second in 1940. During World War II, they were deployed in the [[Nord-Pas-de-Calais]] region of France; they were used to shell [[Kent]] in Southern England between late 1940 and early 1941.

The Hungarian and Croatian attempt to halt the invasion at the [[Battle of Mohi]] failed catastrophically. The [[light cavalry]] that made up most of the Hungarian [[Cavalry|mounted forces]] had proven ineffective against the Mongol troops, though the few heavily armored knights (mostly those of the [[Knights Templar]]) performed significantly better when engaged in close quarters combat.<ref>Sugar, p.27: \"The majority of the Hungarian forces consisted of light cavalry, who appeared 'oriental' to the Western observers. Yet this army had given up nomadic battle tactics and proved useless when facing the masters of this style of warfare. Hungarian tactics were a mix of eastern and western military traditions, as were the ineffective walls of clay bricks and palisades. Two elements of the Hungarian defense had proved effective, however: close combat with mass armored knights and stone fortifications\".</ref> The Mongols decisively crushed the Hungarian army, and proceeded to ravage the countryside for the next year. By the end of their campaign, around a quarter of the population of Hungary had been killed, and most of the kingdom's major settlements had been reduced to rubble.<ref>Sugar, p.27: \"In the plains, between 50 and 80 percent of the settlements were destroyed. In forested areas, in the mountains, and in Transylvania, the demographic loss is estimated at 25-30 percent\".</ref>\n\nThe wooden, clay, and earth<ref>Jackon, p. 65</ref> defenses that made up the walls of most towns and forts fell easily to the Mongol siege engines.<ref>Sugar, p. 26: \"The country centers, lacking defenses, and the residences of [nobles], protected at best by moats, fences, and wooden towers, were no obstacle. Using ballistas, the Mongols leveled the forts, and put the settlements to the torch\".</ref> Many Hungarian settlements didn't have any fortifications at all. One German chronicler observed that the Hungarians \"had almost no city protected by walls or strong fortresses\".<ref>Jackson, p. 66</ref> However, stone castles had significantly better fortunes; none of the few Hungarian stone castles fell, even those deep behind the Mongol lines. When the Mongols tried to use their siege engines on the stone walls of the Croatian [[Fortress of Klis]], they did absolutely no damage, and were repelled with heavy casualties.<ref>Kosztolnyik, p. 174</ref> A similar thing happened when they attempted to capture the citadel of [[Esztergom]], despite having overwhelming numerical superiority and 30 siege machines which they had just used to reduce the wooden towers of the city.<ref>Pow, p. 72, 132,</ref>\n\n===Military reforms===\n[[File:Spisska nova ves...castle.jpg|thumb|260px|The [[Mongol invasion of Europe|Mongol invasion in the 13th century]] led to construction of mighty stone castles, such as [[Spi\u0161 Castle|Szepesv\u00e1r]], today in [[Slovakia]].]]\nKing [[B\u00e9la IV]] took note of this, and spent the next few decades reforming Hungary in preparation for possible future invasions. He used a variety of methods to do this. First and foremost, he amalgamated the ''servientes'' and ''iobagiones castri'' into a new class of heavily armored, well-trained knights of the western type, where previously Hungary's defenses had relied almost entirely on wooden castles and light cavalry.<Ref>Ertman, Thomas. \"Birth of the Leviathan: Building States and Regimes in Medieval and Early Modern Europe.\" Cambridge University Press (January 13, 1997). Page 273.</ref> In 1247 he concluded a feudal agreement with the [[Knights of St. John]], giving them the southeastern borderland in exchange for their help in creating more armored cavalry and fortifications.{{Citation needed|reason=Where is the feudal agreement with the Knights recorded?|date=November 2017}} In 1248, he declared the country's middle strata could enter a baron's service, on the condition that the barons lead the men on his land properly equipped (in armor) into the king's army. Documents from the time state that \"the nobles of our country can enter into military service of bishops in the same way in which they can serve other nobles\". After 1250, free owners of small or middle sized estates serving directly under the king were included (along with barons) in the nobility. Finally, new settlers were given \"conditional\" nobility in exchange for the requirement of fighting mounted and armored at the king's request.<ref>Sugar, p. 28-29</ref> In 1259, he requested that the Pope put him into contact with Venice, as he wanted to hire at least 1,000 crossbowmen ([[crossbows]] having also proven a very effective weapon against the Mongols, despite the relatively small numbers of them actually deployed by the Hungarians in 1241).<ref>Jackson, p, 71 and 84</ref>\n\nTo cement his new defense doctrine, the king offered grants and rewards to cities and nobles in exchange for the building of stone fortifications. The reforms ultimately paid off. By the end of his reign, B\u00e9la IV had overseen the building of nearly 100 new fortresses.{{sfn|Cartledge|2011|p=30}} Of these 100, 66 were stone castles built on elevated sites.<ref>Pow, p. 76: \"[B\u00e9la] showed moral courage in reversing his autocratic policies and granting numerous privileges to nobles on the condition that they build stone castles. Before this time, castle building was purely the business of the Hungarian monarchy. B\u00e9la's energetic policies saw the construction off 66 'new-style' castles during his reign. All of them were built of stone and situated on an elevated sight\".</ref> This was a major upgrade from 1241, when the kingdom only possessed 10 stone castles, half of which were placed along the border with the [[Duchy of Austria]].<ref>Pow, p. 59</ref>\n\n===Lead-up to the second invasion===\n[[File:Hungary 13th cent.png|thumb|left|230px|alt=Map of the Kingdom of Hungary|[[Kingdom of Hungary (1000\u20131301)|Kingdom of Hungary]] in the second half of the 13th&nbsp;century]]\nIn 1254, [[Batu Khan]] demanded a marriage alliance with Hungary and a quarter of its army for a drive into central and western [[Europe]]. In exchange, Hungary would be spared from tribute obligations and any further destruction. B\u00e9la ignored the message. Additional ultimatums were sent in 1259 and 1264, this time by Batu's brother and successor, [[Berke Khan]]. Berke made similar demands: if Hungary would submit to the Mongols and grant them a quarter of its army for the planned invasion of Europe, it would receive tax exemption and 1/5 of the plunder. Again, B\u00e9la refused.<ref>Pow, p. 29-30</ref><ref>Jean W. Sedlar, East Central Europe in the Middle Ages, 1000\u20131500 (Seattle: University of Washington Press), 379.</ref> Letters exchanged between B\u00e9la and the Pope circa 1259 imply that the Mongols had been well known to be untrustworthy for decades, with the Pope saying that any agreements made by the \"perfidious\" conquerors were worthless.<ref>Bezzola, Die Mongolen, 188.</reF>\n\nAfter the deaths of the kings [[B\u00e9la IV of Hungary|B\u00e9la IV]] and [[Stephen V of Hungary|Stephen V]], [[Ladislaus IV of Hungary|Ladislaus IV]] assumed the [[King of Hungary|Hungarian throne]] in 1272. Under the maternal influence, he became known as the ''Ladislaus the Cuman''. In the next years, his resistance against the nobles and clerics became stronger, to the point that he arrested a papal legate over a law requiring the pagan [[Cumans]] convert to Christianity and imprisoned his Christian wife, [[Elizabeth of Sicily, Queen of Hungary|Isabel of Anjou]]. The barons raised an army and [[Lodomer]], [[Archbishop of Esztergom]] declared a crusade against the Hungarian king.<ref>Chambers, p. 164</ref> However, when the Cumans rebelled and invaded Hungary in 1282, Ladislaus and his nobles did not hesitate to crush the rebellion. The ''[[Illuminated Chronicle]]'' writes that Ladislaus, \"like the brave Joshua, went out against\" the Cumans \"to fight for his people and his realm,\" defeating the Cuman army at Lake H\u00f3d, near [[H\u00f3dmez\u0151v\u00e1s\u00e1rhely]].<ref>Salagean, p. 133</ref>\n\nDespite this, the king's reputation especially among his nobles remained very poor. In 1283 he settled among his Cuman subjects after abandoning his wife, and took Cuman women as his mistresses. The 1282 Cuman rebellion may have catalyzed the Mongol invasion. Cuman warriors driven out of Hungary offered their services to Nogai Khan, ''de facto'' head of the [[Golden Horde]], and told him about the perilous political situation in Hungary. Seeing this as an opportunity, Nogai decided to start a vast campaign against the apparently weak kingdom.<reF>Salagean, p. 135</ref>\n\n==Invasion==\n\n=== Forces ===\nIn the winter of 1285, Mongol armies invaded Hungary for a second time. As in the [[Battle of Mohi|first invasion]] in 1241, Mongols invaded Hungary in two fronts. Nogai invaded via [[Transylvania]], while Talabuga invaded via [[Carpathian Ruthenia|Transcarpathia]] and [[Moravia]]. A third, smaller force likely entered the center of the kingdom, mirroring Kadan's earlier route. The invasion paths seemed to mirror those taken by Batu and Subutai 40 years earlier, with Talabuga going through [[Verecke Pass]] and Nogai going through [[Brass\u00f3 County|Brass\u00f3]] to enter Transylvania.<Ref>Salagean, p. 135</ref> Much like the first invasion, the Mongols emphasized speed and surprise and intended to destroy the Hungarian forces in detail, invading in winter for hope of catching the Hungarians off guard and moving fast enough that it was impossible (at least until their later setbacks) for Ladislaus to gather enough men to engage them in a decisive confrontation.<ref>Salagean, p. 136</ref> Because of the lack of civil war in the Mongol Empire at the time, as well as the lack of any other major conflicts involving the Golden Horde, Nogai was able to field a very large army for this invasion,<ref>Jackson, p. 199</ref> with the [[Galician-Volhynian Chronicle]] describing it as \"a great host\"<ref>Perfecky, George A. (1973). The Galician-Volynian Chronicle. Munich: Wilhelm Fink Verlag. Page 95.</ref> but its exact size isn't certain. It is known that the Mongol host included cavalry from their vassals, the Ruthenian princes, including [[Leo I of Galicia|Lev Daniilovich]] and others from among their Rus\u2032 satellites.<Ref>Jackon, p. 205</ref>\n\nStefan Kraowski indirectly places the Mongol invasion force a fair bit above 30,000 men by estimating the smaller Mongol invasion of Poland two years later as having about that many soldiers, stating that Nogai and Talabuga personally leading an invasion suggests it is a massive force by definition.<ref>Krakowski, p. 212</ref> Peter Jackson, using contemporary Hungarian charters, concludes that the Mongol army was very large, but is unsure if it was larger, smaller, or comparable in size to the 1241\u201342 invasion force.<ref>Jackson, p. 205: \"Even though figures given by German analysts smack of hyperbole, the language of the Hungarian charters certainly indicates that the numbers involved were considerable\".</ref> A contemporary letter from Benedict, the provost of [[Esztergom]], estimates the size of the Mongol army at 200,000. This is almost certainly an enormous exaggeration, as the Mongols almost never fielded armies larger than 100,000 men.<ref>Jackson, p. 225</ref> The Austrian chronicler of Salzburg recorded that the Mongol military camp covered an area of {{convert|10|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on|0}} in width and {{convert|6|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on|0}} in depth (whether this was Nogai's or Talabuga's army, or how this chronicler got his information, is unknown).<ref>Kosztolnyik, p. 286</ref> The Galician-Volhynian Chronicle puts the size of the Mongol army in the hundreds of thousands, saying that Talabuga's column alone lost 100,000 men during the march through the Carpathians.<ref>Perfecky, George A. (1973). The Galician-Volynian Chronicle. Munich: Wilhelm Fink Verlag. Page 96.</ref>\n\nThe Hungarian forces were probably similar in size to the invading Mongols. In 1255, William of Rubruck wrote that the Hungarians could gather at most 30,000 soldiers, a situation that probably hadn't drastically changed in the last three decades.<Ref>William of Rubruck. \"The journey of William of Rubruck to the eastern parts of the world, 1253-55.\" Translated by  William Woodville Rockhill. Page 281. \"It would be very easy to conquer or to pass through all these countries. The King of Hungary has not at most XXX thousand soldiers.\"</ref> It is unknown how many of these men were mustered during the period of the Mongol invasion.\n\n=== Central/Northern Hungary, Transcarpathia, and Western Transylvania ===\nTalabuga, who led the main army in Northern Hungary, was stopped by the heavy snow of the [[Carpathian Mountains|Carpathians]]. On the march up, his force was devastated by logistical factors, namely a shortage of food which caused the deaths of thousands of his soldiers, as attested to by the Galician-Volynian Chronicle and certain contemporary Polish sources.<ref>Pow, p. 28</ref> This was likely the result of the traditional tactics of castle warfare, which involve starving out the invaders by hoarding all available food stocks, while launching small raids and sallies from the castles. Polish chroniclers hostile to the Hungarian king stated that Ladislaus was too cowardly to face the Mongols in a straight battle, very likely a misinterpretation of successful battle avoidance and [[scorched earth]] tactics.<ref>Hans-Hemming Kortum. \"Transcultural Wars: from the Middle Ages to the 21st Century\". Akademie Verlag (March 22, 2006). Page 227. Footnote 68.</ref> \n\nAt the beginning of the campaign the invading force devastated central Hungary and entered the town of [[Pest, Hungary|Pest]]. They burned it, but the town had long since been abandoned by its population, who fled south and west of the Danube.<ref>Kosztolnyik, p. 286</ref> During this event, members of Queen Elizabeth's household launched a spirited and effective sally against the Mongols, while she watched from the safety of the walls of Buda.<ref>Jackson, p. 205</ref> Talabuga's forces encountered great difficulties with the density of fortifications and failed to capture any castles or fortified cities.<ref>Salagean, p. 136</ref> However, they caused major damage to the civilian population, and raided as far as the Danube. Local Hungarian forces fought the Mongols in many defensive battles, for which the king had promoted several lesser officials who had distinguished themselves, including [[George Baksa]], [[Amadeus Aba]] his relative, Peter Aba from the clan's Somos branch.<ref>Kosztolnyik, p. 285</ref> One such battle took place near the castle of Turusko (Trascau), where the Mongols suffered a sharp defeat with heavy casualties, including 1,000 taken prisoner.<ref>Henry Hoyle Howorth. \"History of the Mongols from the 9th to the 19th Century\". COSIMO CLASSICS, 2013. Originally published 1876. Page 1,014.</ref> Talabuga's weakened army was ultimately defeated<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=vEJNBqanT_8C&pg=PA109&dq=mongol+ladislaus+hungary+1285&hl=en&sa=X&ei=LScqT-CyGKuTiAfZodDGDg&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=%22in%201285%20he%20succeeded%20in%20driving%20back%20the%20second%20Mongol%20invasion%22&f=false Engel, p. 109]</ref> when met head-on in battle by the hastily assembled royal army of [[Ladislaus IV of Hungary|Ladislaus IV]], in the hills of western Transylvania.<ref>Kosztolnyik, p. 286</ref> The army had benefited from the reforms and had a higher proportion of [[knight]]s than the army the Mongols had defeated a few decades earlier at Mohi.\n\nAfter the defeat, Talabuga ordered a retreat from Hungary, but his army was ambushed on the return by the [[Sz\u00e9kely]] people, who fought as light cavalry. By the time he made it back to friendly territory, his army had effectively ceased to exist, with the majority of the soldiers he brought dying in the failed raid.<ref>Jackson, p. 209: \"The Volynian Chronicle has [Talabuga] arrive back with few survivors of his original force after crossing the Carpathians\".</ref> By the hyperbole of one chronicler, Talabuga arrived back in Ruthenia with only his wife and one horse. Once he finally reached  [[Volynia]], his starving soldiers plundered the towns of his allies and vassals.<ref>Chambers, p. 165</ref>\n\n=== Transylvania and the Hungarian Plains ===\nNogai stayed in Transylvania until the spring of 1286. Here he plundered some towns and villages, such as [[Reghin|Sz\u00e1szr\u00e9gen (Reghin)]], [[Bra\u015fov|Brass\u00f3 (Bra\u015fov)]] and [[Bistri\u021ba|Beszterce (Bistri\u021ba)]]. He also managed to destroy a few forts and walled towns. However, like Talabuga, he failed to take any major fortifications, with the exception of the [[Saxon]] castle of [[Mikod K\u00f6k\u00e9nyesradn\u00f3t|Ban Mikod]] in the Aranyos Valley, the former royal stronghold of [[Turda|Torda]] (today Turda, Romania).<ref>Salagean, p. 136</ref><ref>Pow, p. 77: \"They accomplished very little in terms of taking fortified places, and met with defeat in Transylvania\"</ref> After the defeat of Talabuga's main column, King Ladislaus IV led an expedition to expel Nogai's forces from Transylvania. His army arrived too late to make a significant difference, as Nogai's forces had already suffered a serious defeat at the hands of local Hungarian troops--mostly the Saxons, [[Vlach]]s, and [[Sz\u00e9kely]]s, commanded by [[Voivode of Transylvania|Voivode]] [[Roland Borsa]].<ref>Jackson, p. 205: \"According to a contemporary letter and reports that reached Germany, it was the local troops--Saxons, Vlachs, and Sz\u00e9kely, with the last fighting as light cavalry--who cut off [the Mongols'] retreat in Transylvania and inflicted on them a serious reverse.\"</ref> Ladislaus settled for harassing their withdrawal.\n\n==Aftermath==\nThe results of the invasion could not have contrasted more sharply with those of the 1241 invasion. The invasion was repelled handily, and the Mongols lost much of their invading force due to several months of starvation, numerous small raids, and two major military defeats. This was mostly thanks to the new fortification network and the military reforms. No major invasion of Hungary would be launched after the failure of the campaign of 1285, though small raids from the Golden Horde were frequent well into the 14th century. Less than two years later, the [[Third Mongol invasion of Poland]] occurred. This invasion was also repulsed, with the Poles using a similar strategy to the Hungarians in 1285. They were aided by a Hungarian force under [[George Baksa]] (also known as George of S\u00f3v\u00e1r).<ref>Krakowski, p. 217-218.</ref> It was probably in reprisal for this event that in late 1288, a Mongol force launched an attack on the [[Szepes County|Szepes]] (Spi\u0161) region, albeit on a small scale. They were repelled, with George again distinguishing himself.<ref>Jackson, p. 205</ref>\n\nWhile a victory for Hungary overall (albeit with heavy civilian casualties), the war was a political disaster for the king. Like his grandfather before him, many nobles accused him of inviting the Mongols into his lands, due to his perceived ties to the Cumans.<ref>Salagean, p. 137</ref> Possibly more disastrously, the invasion was fended off by local barons and other magnates with little help from the king. After proving their military skills, the efficiency of their fortifications and armed forces, and their ability to ensure the safety of their subjects to a greater degree than the king or his dignitaries, various local elites expanded their net of supporters and deemed themselves entitled to rule large regions of the kingdom. The crisis brought to light the king's lack of significant military resources and inability to compensate for such via political skills.<ref>Salagean, p. 138</ref>\n\nThe heavy losses suffered by the Mongols in this war, combined with their defeat in Poland shortly after (though they did successfully re-vassalize Bulgaria between these expeditions), contributed to the lack of major Golden Horde operations in central Europe outside of the 1280s. From then on, Mongol attacks on Hungary and Transylvania would be limited to raids and pillaging along the frontier lines.<Ref>Salagean, 137</ref> By the 14th century, the Golden Horde and much of the Mongolian Empire posed no serious threats thereafter to Hungary, despite frontier raids continuing under [[\u00d6z Beg Khan]]. In fact, in 1345, a Hungarian army under Count [[Andrew Lackfi]] took the initiative and launched an invasion force into Mongolian territory, defeating a Golden Horde force and capturing what would become [[Moldavia]].<ref>Kort\u00fcm, Hans-Henning.

The Hungarian and Croatian attempt to halt the invasion at the [[Battle of Mohi]] failed catastrophically. The [[light cavalry]] that made up most of the Hungarian [[Cavalry|mounted forces]] had proven ineffective against the Mongol troops, though the few heavily armored knights (mostly those of the [[Knights Templar]]) performed significantly better when engaged in close quarters combat.<ref>Sugar, p.27: \"The majority of the Hungarian forces consisted of light cavalry, who appeared 'oriental' to the Western observers. Yet this army had given up nomadic battle tactics and proved useless when facing the masters of this style of warfare. Hungarian tactics were a mix of eastern and western military traditions, as were the ineffective walls of clay bricks and palisades. Two elements of the Hungarian defense had proved effective, however: close combat with mass armored knights and stone fortifications\".</ref> The Mongols decisively crushed the Hungarian army, and proceeded to ravage the countryside for the next year. By the end of their campaign, around a quarter of the population of Hungary had been killed, and most of the kingdom's major settlements had been reduced to rubble.<ref>Sugar, p.27: \"In the plains, between 50 and 80 percent of the settlements were destroyed. In forested areas, in the mountains, and in Transylvania, the demographic loss is estimated at 25-30 percent\".</ref>\n\nThe wooden, clay, and earth<ref>Jackon, p. 65</ref> defenses that made up the walls of most towns and forts fell easily to the Mongol siege engines.<ref>Sugar, p. 26: \"The country centers, lacking defenses, and the residences of [nobles], protected at best by moats, fences, and wooden towers, were no obstacle. Using ballistas, the Mongols leveled the forts, and put the settlements to the torch\".</ref> Many Hungarian settlements didn't have any fortifications at all. One German chronicler observed that the Hungarians \"had almost no city protected by walls or strong fortresses\".<ref>Jackson, p. 66</ref> However, stone castles had significantly better fortunes; none of the few Hungarian stone castles fell, even those deep behind the Mongol lines. When the Mongols tried to use their siege engines on the stone walls of the Croatian [[Fortress of Klis]], they did absolutely no damage, and were repelled with heavy casualties.<ref>Kosztolnyik, p. 174</ref> A similar thing happened when they attempted to capture the citadel of [[Esztergom]], despite having overwhelming numerical superiority and 30 siege machines which they had just used to reduce the wooden towers of the city.<ref>Pow, p. 72, 132,</ref>\n\n===Military reforms===\n[[File:Spisska nova ves...castle.jpg|thumb|260px|The [[Mongol invasion of Europe|Mongol invasion in the 13th century]] led to construction of mighty stone castles, such as [[Spi\u0161 Castle|Szepesv\u00e1r]], today in [[Slovakia]].]]\nKing [[B\u00e9la IV]] took note of this, and spent the next few decades reforming Hungary in preparation for possible future invasions. He used a variety of methods to do this. First and foremost, he amalgamated the ''servientes'' and ''iobagiones castri'' into a new class of heavily armored, well-trained knights of the western type, where previously Hungary's defenses had relied almost entirely on wooden castles and light cavalry.<Ref>Ertman, Thomas. \"Birth of the Leviathan: Building States and Regimes in Medieval and Early Modern Europe.\" Cambridge University Press (January 13, 1997). Page 273.</ref> In 1247 he concluded a feudal agreement with the [[Knights of St. John]], giving them the southeastern borderland in exchange for their help in creating more armored cavalry and fortifications.{{Citation needed|reason=Where is the feudal agreement with the Knights recorded?|date=November 2017}} In 1248, he declared the country's middle strata could enter a baron's service, on the condition that the barons lead the men on his land properly equipped (in armor) into the king's army. Documents from the time state that \"the nobles of our country can enter into military service of bishops in the same way in which they can serve other nobles\". After 1250, free owners of small or middle sized estates serving directly under the king were included (along with barons) in the nobility. Finally, new settlers were given \"conditional\" nobility in exchange for the requirement of fighting mounted and armored at the king's request.<ref>Sugar, p. 28-29</ref> In 1259, he requested that the Pope put him into contact with Venice, as he wanted to hire at least 1,000 crossbowmen ([[crossbows]] having also proven a very effective weapon against the Mongols, despite the relatively small numbers of them actually deployed by the Hungarians in 1241).<ref>Jackson, p, 71 and 84</ref>\n\nTo cement his new defense doctrine, the king offered grants and rewards to cities and nobles in exchange for the building of stone fortifications. The reforms ultimately paid off. By the end of his reign, B\u00e9la IV had overseen the building of nearly 100 new fortresses.{{sfn|Cartledge|2011|p=30}} Of these 100, 66 were stone castles built on elevated sites.<ref>Pow, p. 76: \"[B\u00e9la] showed moral courage in reversing his autocratic policies and granting numerous privileges to nobles on the condition that they build stone castles. Before this time, castle building was purely the business of the Hungarian monarchy. B\u00e9la's energetic policies saw the construction off 66 'new-style' castles during his reign. All of them were built of stone and situated on an elevated sight\".</ref> This was a major upgrade from 1241, when the kingdom only possessed 10 stone castles, half of which were placed along the border with the [[Duchy of Austria]].<ref>Pow, p. 59</ref>\n\n===Lead-up to the second invasion===\n[[File:Hungary 13th cent.png|thumb|left|230px|alt=Map of the Kingdom of Hungary|[[Kingdom of Hungary (1000\u20131301)|Kingdom of Hungary]] in the second half of the 13th&nbsp;century]]\nIn 1254, [[Batu Khan]] demanded a marriage alliance with Hungary and a quarter of its army for a drive into central and western [[Europe]]. In exchange, Hungary would be spared from tribute obligations and any further destruction. B\u00e9la ignored the message. Additional ultimatums were sent in 1259 and 1264, this time by Batu's brother and successor, [[Berke Khan]]. Berke made similar demands: if Hungary would submit to the Mongols and grant them a quarter of its army for the planned invasion of Europe, it would receive tax exemption and 1/5 of the plunder. Again, B\u00e9la refused.<ref>Pow, p. 29-30</ref><ref>Jean W. Sedlar, East Central Europe in the Middle Ages, 1000\u20131500 (Seattle: University of Washington Press), 379.</ref> Letters exchanged between B\u00e9la and the Pope circa 1259 imply that the Mongols had been well known to be untrustworthy for decades, with the Pope saying that any agreements made by the \"perfidious\" conquerors were worthless.<ref>Bezzola, Die Mongolen, 188.</reF>\n\nAfter the deaths of the kings [[B\u00e9la IV of Hungary|B\u00e9la IV]] and [[Stephen V of Hungary|Stephen V]], [[Ladislaus IV of Hungary|Ladislaus IV]] assumed the [[King of Hungary|Hungarian throne]] in 1272. Under the maternal influence, he became known as the ''Ladislaus the Cuman''. In the next years, his resistance against the nobles and clerics became stronger, to the point that he arrested a papal legate over a law requiring the pagan [[Cumans]] convert to Christianity and imprisoned his Christian wife, [[Elizabeth of Sicily, Queen of Hungary|Isabel of Anjou]]. The barons raised an army and [[Lodomer]], [[Archbishop of Esztergom]] declared a crusade against the Hungarian king.<ref>Chambers, p. 164</ref> However, when the Cumans rebelled and invaded Hungary in 1282, Ladislaus and his nobles did not hesitate to crush the rebellion. The ''[[Illuminated Chronicle]]'' writes that Ladislaus, \"like the brave Joshua, went out against\" the Cumans \"to fight for his people and his realm,\" defeating the Cuman army at Lake H\u00f3d, near [[H\u00f3dmez\u0151v\u00e1s\u00e1rhely]].<ref>Salagean, p. 133</ref>\n\nDespite this, the king's reputation especially among his nobles remained very poor. In 1283 he settled among his Cuman subjects after abandoning his wife, and took Cuman women as his mistresses. The 1282 Cuman rebellion may have catalyzed the Mongol invasion. Cuman warriors driven out of Hungary offered their services to Nogai Khan, ''de facto'' head of the [[Golden Horde]], and told him about the perilous political situation in Hungary. Seeing this as an opportunity, Nogai decided to start a vast campaign against the apparently weak kingdom.<reF>Salagean, p. 135</ref>\n\n==Invasion==\n\n=== Forces ===\nIn the winter of 1285, Mongol armies invaded Hungary for a second time. As in the [[Battle of Mohi|first invasion]] in 1241, Mongols invaded Hungary in two fronts. Nogai invaded via [[Transylvania]], while Talabuga invaded via [[Carpathian Ruthenia|Transcarpathia]] and [[Moravia]]. A third, smaller force likely entered the center of the kingdom, mirroring Kadan's earlier route. The invasion paths seemed to mirror those taken by Batu and Subutai 40 years earlier, with Talabuga going through [[Verecke Pass]] and Nogai going through [[Brass\u00f3 County|Brass\u00f3]] to enter Transylvania.<Ref>Salagean, p. 135</ref> Much like the first invasion, the Mongols emphasized speed and surprise and intended to destroy the Hungarian forces in detail, invading in winter for hope of catching the Hungarians off guard and moving fast enough that it was impossible (at least until their later setbacks) for Ladislaus to gather enough men to engage them in a decisive confrontation.<ref>Salagean, p. 136</ref> Because of the lack of civil war in the Mongol Empire at the time, as well as the lack of any other major conflicts involving the Golden Horde, Nogai was able to field a very large army for this invasion,<ref>Jackson, p. 199</ref> with the [[Galician-Volhynian Chronicle]] describing it as \"a great host\"<ref>Perfecky, George A. (1973). The Galician-Volynian Chronicle. Munich: Wilhelm Fink Verlag. Page 95.</ref> but its exact size isn't certain. It is known that the Mongol host included cavalry from their vassals, the Ruthenian princes, including Lev Daniilovich and others from among their Rus\u2032 satellites.<Ref>Jackon, p. 205</ref>\n\nStefan Kraowski indirectly places the Mongol invasion force a fair bit above 30,000 men by estimating the smaller Mongol invasion of Poland two years later as having about that many soldiers, stating that Nogai and Talabuga personally leading an invasion suggests it is a massive force by definition.<ref>Krakowski, p. 212</ref> Peter Jackson, using contemporary Hungarian charters, concludes that the Mongol army was very large, but is unsure if it was larger, smaller, or comparable in size to the 1241\u201342 invasion force.<ref>Jackson, p. 205: \"Even though figures given by German analysts smack of hyperbole, the language of the Hungarian charters certainly indicates that the numbers involved were considerable\".</ref> A contemporary letter from Benedict, the provost of [[Esztergom]], estimates the size of the Mongol army at 200,000. This is almost certainly an enormous exaggeration, as the Mongols almost never fielded armies larger than 100,000 men.<ref>Jackson, p. 225</ref> The Austrian chronicler of Salzburg recorded that the Mongol military camp covered an area of {{convert|10|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on|0}} in width and {{convert|6|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on|0}} in depth (whether this was Nogai's or Talabuga's army, or how this chronicler got his information, is unknown).<ref>Kosztolnyik, p. 286</ref> The Galician-Volhynian Chronicle puts the size of the Mongol army in the hundreds of thousands, saying that Talabuga's column alone lost 100,000 men during the march through the Carpathians.<ref>Perfecky, George A. (1973). The Galician-Volynian Chronicle. Munich: Wilhelm Fink Verlag. Page 96.</ref>\n\nThe Hungarian forces were probably similar in size to the invading Mongols. In 1255, William of Rubruck wrote that the Hungarians could gather at most 30,000 soldiers, a situation that probably hadn't drastically changed in the last three decades.<Ref>William of Rubruck. \"The journey of William of Rubruck to the eastern parts of the world, 1253-55.\" Translated by  William Woodville Rockhill. Page 281. \"It would be very easy to conquer or to pass through all these countries. The King of Hungary has not at most XXX thousand soldiers.\"</ref> It is unknown how many of these men were mustered during the period of the Mongol invasion.\n\n=== Central/Northern Hungary, Transcarpathia, and Western Transylvania ===\nTalabuga, who led the main army in Northern Hungary, was stopped by the heavy snow of the [[Carpathian Mountains|Carpathians]]. On the march up, his force was devastated by logistical factors, namely a shortage of food which caused the deaths of thousands of his soldiers, as attested to by the Galician-Volynian Chronicle and certain contemporary Polish sources.<ref>Pow, p. 28</ref> This was likely the result of the traditional tactics of castle warfare, which involve starving out the invaders by hoarding all available food stocks, while launching small raids and sallies from the castles. Polish chroniclers hostile to the Hungarian king stated that Ladislaus was too cowardly to face the Mongols in a straight battle, very likely a misinterpretation of successful battle avoidance and [[scorched earth]] tactics.<ref>Hans-Hemming Kortum. \"Transcultural Wars: from the Middle Ages to the 21st Century\". Akademie Verlag (March 22, 2006). Page 227. Footnote 68.</ref> \n\nAt the beginning of the campaign the invading force devastated central Hungary and entered the town of [[Pest, Hungary|Pest]]. They burned it, but the town had long since been abandoned by its population, who fled south and west of the Danube.<ref>Kosztolnyik, p. 286</ref> During this event, members of Queen Elizabeth's household launched a spirited and effective sally against the Mongols, while she watched from the safety of the walls of Buda.<ref>Jackson, p. 205</ref> Talabuga's forces encountered great difficulties with the density of fortifications and failed to capture any castles or fortified cities.<ref>Salagean, p. 136</ref> However, they caused major damage to the civilian population, and raided as far as the Danube. Local Hungarian forces fought the Mongols in many defensive battles, for which the king had promoted several lesser officials who had distinguished themselves, including [[George Baksa]], [[Amadeus Aba]] his relative, Peter Aba from the clan's Somos branch.<ref>Kosztolnyik, p. 285</ref> One such battle took place near the castle of Turusko (Trascau), where the Mongols suffered a sharp defeat with heavy casualties, including 1,000 taken prisoner.<ref>Henry Hoyle Howorth. \"History of the Mongols from the 9th to the 19th Century\".

By the time he made it back to friendly territory, his army had effectively ceased to exist, with the majority of the soldiers he brought dying in the failed raid.<ref>Jackson, p. 209: \"The Volynian Chronicle has [Talabuga] arrive back with few survivors of his original force after crossing the Carpathians\".</ref> By the hyperbole of one chronicler, Talabuga arrived back in Ruthenia with only his wife and one horse. Once he finally reached  [[Volynia]], his starving soldiers plundered the towns of his allies and vassals.<ref>Chambers, p. 165</ref>\n\n=== Transylvania and the Hungarian Plains ===\nNogai stayed in Transylvania until the spring of 1286. Here he plundered some towns and villages, such as [[Reghin|Sz\u00e1szr\u00e9gen (Reghin)]], [[Bra\u015fov|Brass\u00f3 (Bra\u015fov)]] and [[Bistri\u021ba|Beszterce (Bistri\u021ba)]]. He also managed to destroy a few forts and walled towns. However, like Talabuga, he failed to take any major fortifications, with the exception of the [[Saxon]] castle of [[Mikod K\u00f6k\u00e9nyesradn\u00f3t|Ban Mikod]] in the Aranyos Valley, the former royal stronghold of [[Turda|Torda]] (today Turda, Romania).<ref>Salagean, p. 136</ref><ref>Pow, p. 77: \"They accomplished very little in terms of taking fortified places, and met with defeat in Transylvania\"</ref> After the defeat of Talabuga's main column, King Ladislaus IV led an expedition to expel Nogai's forces from Transylvania. His army arrived too late to make a significant difference, as Nogai's forces had already suffered a serious defeat at the hands of local Hungarian troops--mostly the Saxons, [[Vlach]]s, and [[Sz\u00e9kely]]s, commanded by [[Voivode of Transylvania|Voivode]] [[Roland Borsa]].<ref>Jackson, p. 205: \"According to a contemporary letter and reports that reached Germany, it was the local troops--Saxons, Vlachs, and Sz\u00e9kely, with the last fighting as light cavalry--who cut off [the Mongols'] retreat in Transylvania and inflicted on them a serious reverse.\"</ref> Ladislaus settled for harassing their withdrawal.\n\n==Aftermath==\nThe results of the invasion could not have contrasted more sharply with those of the 1241 invasion. The invasion was repelled handily, and the Mongols lost much of their invading force due to several months of starvation, numerous small raids, and two major military defeats. This was mostly thanks to the new fortification network and the military reforms. No major invasion of Hungary would be launched after the failure of the campaign of 1285, though small raids from the Golden Horde were frequent well into the 14th century. Less than two years later, the [[Third Mongol invasion of Poland]] occurred. This invasion was also repulsed, with the Poles using a similar strategy to the Hungarians in 1285. They were aided by a Hungarian force under [[George Baksa]] (also known as George of S\u00f3v\u00e1r).<ref>Krakowski, p. 217-218.</ref> It was probably in reprisal for this event that in late 1288, a Mongol force launched an attack on the [[Szepes County|Szepes]] (Spi\u0161) region, albeit on a small scale. They were repelled, with George again distinguishing himself.<ref>Jackson, p. 205</ref>\n\nWhile a victory for Hungary overall (albeit with heavy civilian casualties), the war was a political disaster for the king. Like his grandfather before him, many nobles accused him of inviting the Mongols into his lands, due to his perceived ties to the Cumans.<ref>Salagean, p. 137</ref> Possibly more disastrously, the invasion was fended off by local barons and other magnates with little help from the king. After proving their military skills, the efficiency of their fortifications and armed forces, and their ability to ensure the safety of their subjects to a greater degree than the king or his dignitaries, various local elites expanded their net of supporters and deemed themselves entitled to rule large regions of the kingdom. The crisis brought to light the king's lack of significant military resources and inability to compensate for such via political skills.<ref>Salagean, p. 138</ref>\n\nThe heavy losses suffered by the Mongols in this war, combined with their defeat in Poland shortly after (though they did successfully re-vassalize Bulgaria between these expeditions), contributed to the lack of major Golden Horde operations in central Europe outside of the 1280s. From then on, Mongol attacks on Hungary and Transylvania would be limited to raids and pillaging along the frontier lines.<Ref>Salagean, 137</ref> By the 14th century, the Golden Horde and much of the Mongolian Empire posed no serious threats thereafter to Hungary, despite frontier raids continuing under [[\u00d6z Beg Khan]]. In fact, in 1345, a Hungarian army under Count [[Andrew Lackfi]] took the initiative and launched an invasion force into Mongolian territory, defeating a Golden Horde force and capturing what would become [[Moldavia]].<ref>Kort\u00fcm, Hans-Henning.
