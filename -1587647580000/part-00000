All iPads can connect using [[Wi-Fi]]; some models also have [[Cellular network|cellular]] connectivity. iPads can [[video camera|shoot video]], [[camera phone|take photos]], [[portable media player|play music]], and perform Internet functions such as web-browsing and emailing. Other functions{{snd}} [[Video game|games]], [[reference work|reference]], [[GPS navigation software|GPS navigation]], [[social networking service|social networking]], etc.{{snd}} can be enabled by downloading and installing [[application software|apps]]. {{as of|2016|March|}}, the [[App Store (iOS)|App Store]] has more than 1 million apps for the iPad by Apple and third parties.\n\nThere have been nine [[List of iOS devices#iPad|versions]] of the iPad. The [[iPad (first generation)|first generation]] established design precedents, some of which have persisted through all models. The [[iPad (2nd generation)|2nd-generation iPad]] (iPad 2) introduced a new thinner design, a [[multi-core processor|dual-core]] [[Apple A5]] processor, and VGA front-facing and [[720p]] rear-facing cameras designed for [[FaceTime]] video calling. The [[iPad (third generation)|third generation]] added a [[Retina Display]], the new [[Apple A5X]] processor with a [[Multi-core processor|quad-core]] [[Graphics processing unit|graphics processor]], a 5-[[megapixel]] camera, HD [[1080p]] video recording, [[Digital dictation|voice dictation]], and [[4G]] ([[3GPP Long Term Evolution|LTE]]). The [[iPad (fourth generation)|fourth generation]] added the [[Apple A6X]] processor and replaced the [[30-pin dock connector#Apple 30-pin dock connector|30-pin connector]] with an all-digital [[Lightning (connector)|Lightning connector]]. The [[iPad Air]] added the [[Apple A7]] processor and the [[Apple M7]] motion coprocessor, and reduced the thickness for the first time since the iPad 2. The [[iPad Air 2]] added the [[Apple A8X]] processor, the [[Apple M8]] [[Apple motion coprocessors|motion coprocessor]], an 8-megapixel camera, and the [[Touch ID]] [[Fingerprint recognition|fingerprint sensor]]; and further reduced the thickness. The [[IPad (2017)|iPad]] introduced in 2017 added the [[Apple A9]] processor, while sacrificing some of the improvements the iPad Air 2 introduced in exchange for a lower launch price. In 2018, Apple released a [[iPad (2018)|2018 model of iPad]] with [[Apple A10 Fusion]] processor and [[Apple Pencil]] support. In March 2019,  the [[iPad Air (2019)|2019 iPad Air]] was released, with 10.5-inch display and [[Apple A12]] chip. In September 2019, Apple released a 10.2 inch [[iPad (2019)|iPad]] with Apple Smart Keyboard support and the same A10 chip.\n\nThere have been five [[List of iOS devices#iPad Mini|versions]] of the [[iPad Mini]], all of which have a screen size of {{convert|7.9|in|cm}}. The [[iPad Mini (first generation)|first generation]] has similar internal specifications to the iPad 2 but uses the [[Lightning (connector)|Lightning connector]] instead. The [[iPad Mini 2]] added the [[Retina Display]], the [[Apple A7]] processor, and the [[Apple M7]] [[Apple motion coprocessors|motion coprocessor]], closely matching the internal specifications of the iPad Air. The [[iPad Mini 3]] added the [[Touch ID]] fingerprint sensor. The [[iPad Mini 4]] features the [[Apple A8]] and the [[Apple M8]] motion coprocessor. The [[iPad Mini (5th generation)|5th generation]] features the Apple A12 SoC.\n\nThere have been four [[List of iOS devices#iPad Pro|generations]] of the [[iPad Pro]]. All generations have included a 12.9\" screen size option, with the other being 9.7\" in first, 10.5\" in second, 11\" in third and fourth generations.\n\n== History ==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable

The iPad mini is available with two different frequency bands worldwide. Both devices support the same quad-band GSM and quad-band UMTS frequencies, but one variant also supports LTE bands 4 and 17 (principally intended for use on the U.S. AT&T network), while the other adds support for [[LTE (telecommunication)|LTE]] bands 1, 3, 5, 13, 25 and CDMA EV-DO Rev. A and Rev. B.\n\nThe 5th generation iPad and 2nd generation iPad mini introduced support for many additional LTE bands worldwide. The iPad Air and Mini with Retina display cellular models come in two variants each, all of which support nano-SIMs, quad-band GSM, pentaband UMTS, and dual-band CDMA EV-DO Rev. A and B. Additionally, one variant of each iPad also supports LTE bands 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 13, 17, 18, 19, 20, 25 and 26 while the other variant supports LTE bands 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 18, 19, 20 and [[Time-Division Long-Term Evolution|TD-LTE]] bands 38, 39 and 40. Apple's ability to handle many different bands in one device allowed it to offer, for the first time, a single iPad variant that supports all the cellular bands and technologies deployed by all the major North American wireless providers at the time of the device's introduction. Moreover, with T-Mobile USA selling the iPad Air and Mini with Retina display, these models became the first iPads that were made available for purchase directly from all four nationwide U.S. wireless carriers (and, as previously indicated, with all U.S. carriers now selling the same hardware variant of the device).\n\n===Accessories===\n{{Main|iPad accessories}}\nApple offers several iPad accessories,<ref>{{cite web |title=iPad must-haves.

The home screen can be accessed at any time by a hardware button below the screen, closing an open application in the process.<ref name=\"home screen\">{{cite web|url=https://www.apple.com/iphone/features/homescreen.html|title= Apple&nbsp;\u2013 iPhone&nbsp;\u2013 Features&nbsp;\u2013 Home screen|publisher=[[Apple Inc.]]|year=2008|accessdate=December 13, 2008}}</ref>{{Failed verification|date=July 2019}}\n\nUsers can also add and delete icons from the dock, which is the same on every home screen. Each home screen holds up to twenty icons, and the dock holds up to six icons. Users can delete Web Clips and third-party applications at any time, and may select only certain applications for transfer from iTunes. Apple's default programs, however, may not be removed.\n\nAlmost all input is given through the touch screen, which understands complex gestures using [[multi-touch]]. The iPad's [[interaction technique]]s enable the user to move the content up or down by a touch-drag motion of the finger. For example, zooming in and out of web pages and photos is done by placing two fingers on the screen and spreading them farther apart or bringing them closer together, a gesture known as \"[[Multi-touch|pinching]]\".\n\nScrolling through a long list or menu is achieved by sliding a finger over the display from bottom to top, or vice versa to go back. In either case, the list moves as if it is pasted on the outer surface of a wheel, slowly decelerating as if affected by friction. In this way, the interface simulates the physics of a real object.\n\nOther [[User-centered design|user-centered]] [[interactive design|interactive]] effects include horizontally sliding sub-selection, the vertically sliding keyboard and bookmarks menu, and widgets that turn around to allow settings to be configured on the other side. Menu bars are found at the top and bottom of the screen when necessary. Their options vary by program, but always follow a consistent style motif. In menu hierarchies, a \"back\" button in the top-left corner of the screen displays the name of the parent folder.\n\n===Multimedia===\nThe layout of the music library is similar to an [[iPod]] or current{{when|date=July 2019}} [[Symbian]] [[S60 (software platform)|S60]] phones. The iPad can sort its media library by songs, artists, albums, videos, [[playlist]]s, [[genre]]s, composers, [[podcast]]s, [[audiobook]]s, and [[Compilation album|compilations]]. Options are always presented alphabetically, except in playlists, which retain their order from [[iTunes]]. The iPhone uses a large font that allows users plenty of room to touch their selection.\n\nUsers can rotate their device horizontally to [[Page orientation|landscape mode]] to access [[Cover Flow]], likewise this feature may be disabled if purposely wishing to view a screen from another angle. Like on iTunes, this feature shows the different album covers in a scroll-through photo library. Scrolling is achieved by swiping a finger across the screen. Alternatively, headset controls can be used to pause, play, skip, and repeat tracks.\n\nThe iPad supports [[gapless playback]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1797 |title= What is Gapless Playback? |accessdate= May 13, 2008 |publisher= [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] Inc. |url-status=dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080508053830/http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1797 |archivedate= May 8, 2008 |df= mdy-all }}</ref> Like the [[iPod Classic#Fifth generation|fifth-generation iPods]] introduced in 2005, the iPad can play [[digital video]], allowing users to watch TV shows and movies in [[widescreen]]. Double-tapping switches between widescreen and [[4:3|fullscreen]] video playback.\n\nThe iPad allows users to purchase and download songs from the iTunes Store directly to their iPad. It includes software that allows the user to upload, view, and email photos taken with the [[#Camera|camera]]. The user zooms in and out of photos by sliding two fingers further apart or closer together, much like Safari. The Camera application also lets users view the camera roll, the pictures that have been taken with the iPad's camera. Those pictures are also available in the Photos application, along with any transferred from [[iPhoto]] or [[Aperture (software)|Aperture]] on a Mac, or [[Adobe Photoshop|Photoshop]] on a Windows [[personal computer|PC]].\n\n===Internet connectivity===\nThe iPad can use Wi-Fi network [[trilateration]] from [[Skyhook Wireless]] to provide location information to applications such as [[Google Maps]]. The 3G model supports [[Assisted GPS|A-GPS]] to allow its position to be calculated with GPS or relative to nearby cellphone towers; it also has a black strip on the back to aid 3G reception.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.zdnet.com/blog/apple/apple-ipad-does-it-have-real-gps-updated-yes-and-no/5898 |title= Apple iPad: Does it have 'real' GPS?

Also, the iPad's development model requires anyone creating an app for the iPad to sign a [[non-disclosure agreement]] and pay for a developer subscription. Critics argue Apple's centralized app approval process and control of the platform itself could stifle software innovation.

All iPads can connect using [[Wi-Fi]]; some models also have [[Cellular network|cellular]] connectivity. iPads can [[video camera|shoot video]], [[camera phone|take photos]], [[portable media player|play music]], and perform Internet functions such as web-browsing and emailing. Other functions{{snd}} [[Video game|games]], [[reference work|reference]], [[GPS navigation software|GPS navigation]], [[social networking service|social networking]], etc.{{snd}} can be enabled by downloading and installing [[application software|apps]]. {{as of|2016|March|}}, the [[App Store (iOS)|App Store]] has more than 1 million apps for the iPad by Apple and third parties.\n\nThere have been nine [[List of iOS devices#iPad|versions]] of the iPad. The [[iPad (first generation)|first generation]] established design precedents, some of which have persisted through all models. The [[iPad (2nd generation)|2nd-generation iPad]] (iPad 2) introduced a new thinner design, a [[multi-core processor|dual-core]] [[Apple A5]] processor, and VGA front-facing and [[720p]] rear-facing cameras designed for [[FaceTime]] video calling. The [[iPad (third generation)|third generation]] added a [[Retina Display]], the new [[Apple A5X]] processor with a [[Multi-core processor|quad-core]] [[Graphics processing unit|graphics processor]], a 5-[[megapixel]] camera, HD [[1080p]] video recording, [[Digital dictation|voice dictation]], and [[4G]] ([[3GPP Long Term Evolution|LTE]]). The [[iPad (fourth generation)|fourth generation]] added the [[Apple A6X]] processor and replaced the [[30-pin dock connector#Apple 30-pin dock connector|30-pin connector]] with an all-digital [[Lightning (connector)|Lightning connector]]. The [[iPad Air]] added the [[Apple A7]] processor and the [[Apple M7]] motion coprocessor, and reduced the thickness for the first time since the iPad 2. The [[iPad Air 2]] added the [[Apple A8X]] processor, the [[Apple M8]] [[Apple motion coprocessors|motion coprocessor]], an 8-megapixel camera, and the [[Touch ID]] [[Fingerprint recognition|fingerprint sensor]]; and further reduced the thickness. The [[IPad (2017)|iPad]] introduced in 2017 added the [[Apple A9]] processor, while sacrificing some of the improvements the iPad Air 2 introduced in exchange for a lower launch price. In 2018, Apple released a [[iPad (2018)|2018 model of iPad]] with [[Apple A10 Fusion]] processor and [[Apple Pencil]] support. In March 2019,  the [[iPad Air (2019)|2019 iPad Air]] was released, with 10.5-inch display and [[Apple A12]] chip. In September 2019, Apple released a 10.2 inch [[iPad (2019)|iPad]] with Apple Smart Keyboard support and the same A10 chip.\n\nThere have been five [[List of iOS devices#iPad Mini|versions]] of the [[iPad Mini]], all of which have a screen size of {{convert|7.9|in|cm}}. The [[iPad Mini (first generation)|first generation]] has similar internal specifications to the iPad 2 but uses the [[Lightning (connector)|Lightning connector]] instead. The [[iPad Mini 2]] added the [[Retina Display]], the [[Apple A7]] processor, and the [[Apple M7]] [[Apple motion coprocessors|motion coprocessor]], closely matching the internal specifications of the iPad Air. The [[iPad Mini 3]] added the [[Touch ID]] fingerprint sensor. The [[iPad Mini 4]] features the [[Apple A8]] and the [[Apple M8]] motion coprocessor. The [[iPad Mini (5th generation)|5th generation]] features the Apple A12 SoC.\n\nThere have been four [[List of iOS devices#iPad Pro|generations]] of the [[iPad Pro]]. All generations have included a 12.9\" screen size option, with the other being 9.7\" in first, 10.5\" in second, 11\" in third and fourth generations.\n\n== History ==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable

The iPad Air and Mini with Retina display cellular models come in two variants each, all of which support nano-SIMs, quad-band GSM, pentaband UMTS, and dual-band CDMA EV-DO Rev. A and B. Additionally, one variant of each iPad also supports LTE bands 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 13, 17, 18, 19, 20, 25 and 26 while the other variant supports LTE bands 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 18, 19, 20 and [[Time-Division Long-Term Evolution|TD-LTE]] bands 38, 39 and 40. Apple's ability to handle many different bands in one device allowed it to offer, for the first time, a single iPad variant that supports all the cellular bands and technologies deployed by all the major North American wireless providers at the time of the device's introduction. Moreover, with T-Mobile USA selling the iPad Air and Mini with Retina display, these models became the first iPads that were made available for purchase directly from all four nationwide U.S. wireless carriers (and, as previously indicated, with all U.S. carriers now selling the same hardware variant of the device).\n\n===Accessories===\n{{Main|iPad accessories}}\nApple offers several iPad accessories,<ref>{{cite web |title=iPad must-haves.

Smart Covers are not compatible with the original iPad.<ref name=\"Apple Smart Covers\">{{cite web|url=https://www.apple.com/ipad/smart-cover|title=Apple \u2013 Smart Cover|publisher=[[Apple Inc.|Apple]]|date=March 2, 2011|accessdate=March 12, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110307213920/https://www.apple.com/ipad/smart-cover/|archive-date=March 7, 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref> In June 2012, Apple started selling the Smart Case - a case with the combined function of a smart cover and a back protection case which is compatible with the iPad 2, and iPad 3rd & 4th generation devices.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2405949,00.asp|title=Apple iPad Smart Case Review|website=[[PC Magazine]]|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|first=Eugene|last=Kim|date=June 18, 2012|accessdate=August 11, 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Software==\n{{Main|iPadOS|iOS|iOS version history}}\nLike the iPhone, with which it shares a [[development environment (software development process)|development environment]]<ref name=\"SDK\">{{cite web|url= https://developer.apple.com/ipad/sdk/ |title= iPad SDK |publisher= [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] |date= January 27, 2010 |accessdate= January 27, 2010}}</ref> the iPad only runs its own software, software downloaded from Apple's [[App Store (iOS)|App Store]], and software written by developers who have paid for a developer's license on registered devices.<ref name=\"gizmodo-ipad-crit\">{{cite web|url= https://gizmodo.com/5458382/8-things-that-suck-about-the-ipad |title= 8 Things That Suck About the iPad |first= Adam |last= Ferruci |website= [[Gizmodo]] |publisher= [[Gawker Media]] |date= January 27, 2010 |accessdate= February 3, 2010}}</ref>{{Failed verification|date=October 2013}} The iPad runs almost all third-party [[iPhone applications]], displaying them at iPhone size or enlarging them to fill the iPad's screen.<ref name=\"Register iPad release 1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2010/01/27/ipad|title=Steve Jobs uncloaks the 'iPad': World continues to revolve around sun|website=[[The Register]]|first=Rik|last=Myslewski|date=January 27, 2010|accessdate=January 27, 2010}}</ref> Developers may also create or modify apps to take advantage of the iPad's features,<ref>{{cite web |first=MG |last=Siegler |title=The Subplots Of The iPad Blockbuster |url=https://techcrunch.com/2010/01/28/ipad-extras/ |website=[[TechCrunch]] |publisher=[[AOL]] |date=January 28, 2010 |accessdate=March 28, 2017}}</ref> and there are one{{nbsp}}million apps optimized for the iPad, {{as of|2016|March|lc=y}}.<ref>{{cite web |first=Jacob |last=Kastrenakes |title=There are now 1 million iPad apps |url=https://www.theverge.com/2016/3/21/11277804/1-million-ipad-apps |website=[[The Verge]] |publisher=[[Vox Media]] |date=March 21, 2016 |accessdate=March 29, 2017}}</ref> Application developers use iOS SDK for developing applications for iPad.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://developer.apple.com/ipad/sdk/ |title= Develop apps for iPad |publisher =[[Apple Inc.]] |accessdate= August 9, 2012}}</ref> The iPad originally shipped with a customized iPad-only version of iPhone OS, dubbed v3.2. On September 1, it was announced the iPad would get iOS 4.2 by November 2010;<ref>{{cite web |first=Scott |last=Stein |title=iPad to get iOS 4.2 in November |url=https://www.cnet.com/news/ipad-to-get-ios-4-2-in-november/ |website=[[CNET]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |date=September 1, 2010 |accessdate=March 28, 2017}}</ref> to fulfill this Apple released iOS 4.2.1 to the public on November 22.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.macworld.com/article/1155883/ios42_release.html|title=Apple releases iOS 4.2.1|first=Jason|last=Snell|work=[[Macworld]]|date=November 22, 2010|accessdate=January 1, 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Interface===\n\nThe [[Graphical user interface|interface]] is centred around the home screen, a graphical list of available applications. The home screen can be accessed at any time by a hardware button below the screen, closing an open application in the process.<ref name=\"home screen\">{{cite web|url=https://www.apple.com/iphone/features/homescreen.html|title= Apple&nbsp;\u2013 iPhone&nbsp;\u2013 Features&nbsp;\u2013 Home screen|publisher=[[Apple Inc.]]|year=2008|accessdate=December 13, 2008}}</ref>{{Failed verification|date=July 2019}}\n\nUsers can also add and delete icons from the dock, which is the same on every home screen. Each home screen holds up to twenty icons, and the dock holds up to six icons. Users can delete Web Clips and third-party applications at any time, and may select only certain applications for transfer from iTunes. Apple's default programs, however, may not be removed.\n\nAlmost all input is given through the touch screen, which understands complex gestures using [[multi-touch]]. The iPad's [[interaction technique]]s enable the user to move the content up or down by a touch-drag motion of the finger. For example, zooming in and out of web pages and photos is done by placing two fingers on the screen and spreading them farther apart or bringing them closer together, a gesture known as \"[[Multi-touch|pinching]]\".\n\nScrolling through a long list or menu is achieved by sliding a finger over the display from bottom to top, or vice versa to go back. In either case, the list moves as if it is pasted on the outer surface of a wheel, slowly decelerating as if affected by friction. In this way, the interface simulates the physics of a real object.\n\nOther [[User-centered design|user-centered]] [[interactive design|interactive]] effects include horizontally sliding sub-selection, the vertically sliding keyboard and bookmarks menu, and widgets that turn around to allow settings to be configured on the other side. Menu bars are found at the top and bottom of the screen when necessary. Their options vary by program, but always follow a consistent style motif. In menu hierarchies, a \"back\" button in the top-left corner of the screen displays the name of the parent folder.\n\n===Multimedia===\nThe layout of the music library is similar to an [[iPod]] or current{{when|date=July 2019}} [[Symbian]] [[S60 (software platform)|S60]] phones. The iPad can sort its media library by songs, artists, albums, videos, [[playlist]]s, [[genre]]s, composers, [[podcast]]s, [[audiobook]]s, and [[Compilation album|compilations]]. Options are always presented alphabetically, except in playlists, which retain their order from [[iTunes]]. The iPhone uses a large font that allows users plenty of room to touch their selection.\n\nUsers can rotate their device horizontally to [[Page orientation|landscape mode]] to access [[Cover Flow]], likewise this feature may be disabled if purposely wishing to view a screen from another angle. Like on iTunes, this feature shows the different album covers in a scroll-through photo library. Scrolling is achieved by swiping a finger across the screen. Alternatively, headset controls can be used to pause, play, skip, and repeat tracks.\n\nThe iPad supports [[gapless playback]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1797 |title= What is Gapless Playback? |accessdate= May 13, 2008 |publisher= [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] Inc. |url-status=dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080508053830/http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1797 |archivedate= May 8, 2008 |df= mdy-all }}</ref> Like the [[iPod Classic#Fifth generation|fifth-generation iPods]] introduced in 2005, the iPad can play [[digital video]], allowing users to watch TV shows and movies in [[widescreen]]. Double-tapping switches between widescreen and [[4:3|fullscreen]] video playback.\n\nThe iPad allows users to purchase and download songs from the iTunes Store directly to their iPad. It includes software that allows the user to upload, view, and email photos taken with the [[#Camera|camera]]. The user zooms in and out of photos by sliding two fingers further apart or closer together, much like Safari. The Camera application also lets users view the camera roll, the pictures that have been taken with the iPad's camera. Those pictures are also available in the Photos application, along with any transferred from [[iPhoto]] or [[Aperture (software)|Aperture]] on a Mac, or [[Adobe Photoshop|Photoshop]] on a Windows [[personal computer|PC]].\n\n===Internet connectivity===\nThe iPad can use Wi-Fi network [[trilateration]] from [[Skyhook Wireless]] to provide location information to applications such as [[Google Maps]]. The 3G model supports [[Assisted GPS|A-GPS]] to allow its position to be calculated with GPS or relative to nearby cellphone towers; it also has a black strip on the back to aid 3G reception.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.zdnet.com/blog/apple/apple-ipad-does-it-have-real-gps-updated-yes-and-no/5898 |title= Apple iPad: Does it have 'real' GPS?

Also, the iPad's development model requires anyone creating an app for the iPad to sign a [[non-disclosure agreement]] and pay for a developer subscription. Critics argue Apple's centralized app approval process and control of the platform itself could stifle software innovation.

Four bytes are needed for characters in the [[Plane (Unicode)|other planes of Unicode]], which include less common [[CJK characters]], various historic scripts, mathematical symbols, and [[emoji]] (pictographic symbols).\n\nSome of the important features of this encoding are as follows:\n\n* ''Backward compatibility:'' Backwards compatibility with ASCII and the enormous amount of software designed to process ASCII-encoded text was the main driving force behind the design of UTF-8. In UTF-8, single bytes with values in the range of 0 to 127 map directly to Unicode code points in the ASCII range. Single bytes in this range represent characters, as they do in ASCII. Moreover, 7-bit bytes (bytes where the most significant bit is 0) never appear in a multi-byte sequence, and no valid multi-byte sequence decodes to an ASCII code-point. A sequence of 7-bit bytes is both valid ASCII and valid UTF-8, and under either interpretation represents the same sequence of characters. Therefore, the 7-bit bytes in a UTF-8 stream represent all and only the ASCII characters in the stream. Thus, many text processors, parsers, protocols, file formats, text display programs, etc., which use ASCII characters for formatting and control purposes, will continue to work as intended by treating the UTF-8 byte stream as a sequence of single-byte characters, without decoding the multi-byte sequences. ASCII characters on which the processing turns, such as punctuation, whitespace, and control characters will never be encoded as multi-byte sequences. It is therefore safe for such processors to simply ignore or pass-through the multi-byte sequences, without decoding them. For example, ASCII whitespace may be used to [[tokenize]] a UTF-8 stream into words; ASCII line-feeds may be used to split a UTF-8 stream into lines; and ASCII NUL characters can be used to split UTF-8-encoded data into null-terminated strings. Similarly, many format strings used by library functions like \"printf\" will correctly handle UTF-8-encoded input arguments.\n* {{anchor|fallback and auto-detection}}''Fallback and auto-detection:'' UTF-8 provided backwards compatibility for 7-bit ASCII, but much software and data uses 8-bit [[extended ASCII]] encodings designed prior to the adoption of Unicode to represent the character sets of European languages. Part of the popularity of UTF-8 is due to the fact that it provides a form of backward compatibility for these as well. A UTF-8 processor which erroneously receives an [[extended ASCII]] file as input can \"fall back\" or replace 8-bit bytes using the appropriate code-point in the Unicode [[Latin-1 Supplement]] block, when the 8-bit byte appears outside a valid multi-byte sequence. The bytes in extended ASCII encodings of \u201creal world\u201d text are typically not legal UTF-8 multi-byte sequences. This is because the bytes which ''introduce'' multi-byte sequences in UTF-8 are primarily accented letters (mostly vowels) in the common extended ASCII encodings, and the UTF-8 ''continuation'' bytes are punctuation and symbol characters. To appear as a valid UTF-8 multi-byte sequence, a series of 2 to 4 extended ASCII 8-bit characters would have to be an unusual combination of symbols and accented letters (such as an accented vowel followed immediately by certain punctuation). In short, real-world extended ASCII character sequences which look like valid UTF-8 multi-byte sequences are unlikely. Fallback errors will be false negatives, and these will be rare. Moreover, in many applications, such as text display, the consequence of incorrect fallback is usually slight. Only legibility is affected, and only for a few characters. These two things make fallback feasible, if somewhat imperfect. Indeed, as discussed further below, the [[HTML5]] standard requires that erroneous bytes in supposed UTF-8 data be replaced upon display on the assumption that they are [[Windows-1252]] characters. The presence of invalid 8-bit characters outside valid multi-byte sequences can also be used to \"auto-detect\" that an encoding is actually an extended ASCII encoding rather than UTF-8, and decode it accordingly. A UTF-8 stream may simply contain errors, resulting in the auto-detection scheme producing false positives; but auto-detection is successful in the majority of cases, especially with longer texts, and is widely used.\n* ''[[Prefix code]]:'' The first byte indicates the number of bytes in the sequence. Reading from a stream can instantaneously decode each individual fully received sequence, without first having to wait for either the first byte of a next sequence or an end-of-stream indication. The length of multi-byte sequences is easily determined by humans as it is simply the number of high-order 1s in the leading byte. An incorrect character will not be decoded if a stream ends mid-sequence.\n* ''[[Self-synchronizing code|Self-synchronization]]:'' The leading bytes and the continuation bytes do not share values (continuation bytes start with {{mono|10}} while single bytes start with {{mono|0}} and longer lead bytes start with {{mono|11}}). This means a search will not accidentally find the sequence for one character starting in the middle of another character. It also means the start of a character can be found from a random position by backing up at most 3 bytes to find the leading byte. An incorrect character will not be decoded if a stream starts mid-sequence, and a shorter sequence will never appear inside a longer one.\n* ''Sorting order:'' The chosen values of the leading bytes means that a list of UTF-8 strings can be sorted in code point order by sorting the corresponding byte sequences.\n\n===Examples===\nConsider the encoding of the [[Euro sign]], \u20ac:\n\n# The Unicode code point for \"\u20ac\" is U+20AC.\n# According to the scheme table above, this will take three bytes to encode, since it is between U+0800 and U+FFFF.\n#[[Hexadecimal]] {{mono|20AC}} is binary {{mono|{{fontcolor|blue|0010}} {{fontcolor|green|0000 10}}{{fontcolor|red|10 1100}}}}. The two leading zeros are added because, as the scheme table shows, a three-byte encoding needs exactly sixteen bits from the code point.\n# Because the encoding will be three bytes long, its leading byte starts with three 1s, then a 0 ({{mono|1110...}})\n# The four most significant bits of the code point are stored in the remaining low order four bits of this byte ({{mono|1110 {{fontcolor|blue|0010}}}}), leaving 12 bits of the code point yet to be encoded ({{mono|...{{fontcolor|green|0000 10}}{{fontcolor|red|10 1100}}}}).\n# All continuation bytes contain exactly six bits from the code point. So the next six bits of the code point are stored in the low order six bits of the next byte, and {{mono|10}} is stored in the high order two bits to mark it as a continuation byte (so {{mono|10{{fontcolor|green|00 0010}}}}).\n# Finally the last six bits of the code point are stored in the low order six bits of the final byte, and again {{mono|10}} is stored in the high order two bits ({{mono|10{{fontcolor|red|10 1100}}}}).\n\nThe three bytes {{mono|1110 {{fontcolor|blue|0010}}}} {{mono|10{{fontcolor|green|00 0010}}}} {{mono|10{{fontcolor|red|10 1100}}}} can be more concisely written in [[hexadecimal]], as {{mono|{{fontcolor|blue|E2}} {{fontcolor|green|82}} {{fontcolor|red|AC}}}}.\n\nThe following table summarises this conversion, as well as others with different lengths in UTF-8. The colors indicate how bits from the code point are distributed among the UTF-8 bytes. Additional bits added by the UTF-8 encoding process are shown in black.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! colspan=2 rowspan=2 | Character\n! colspan=2 | Code point\n! colspan=3 | UTF-8\n|-\n! Octal\n!

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:Chset-tableformat -->\n\n{{colorbox|#d1f4ff}}{{nbsp}}Blue cells are 7-bit (single-byte) sequences. They must not be followed by a continuation byte.\n\n{{colorbox|#ffcc88}}{{nbsp}}Orange cells with a large dot are continuation bytes. The hexadecimal number shown after the {{mono|+}} symbol is the value of the 6 bits they add.\n\n{{colorbox|#fff}}{{nbsp}}White cells are the leading bytes for a sequence of multiple bytes, the length shown at the left edge of the row. The text shows the Unicode blocks encoded by sequences starting with this byte, and the hexadecimal code point shown in the cell is the lowest character value encoded using that leading byte.\n\n{{colorbox|red}}{{nbsp}}Red cells must never appear in a valid UTF-8 sequence. The first two red cells ({{mono|C0}} and {{mono|C1}}) could be used only for a 2-byte encoding of a 7-bit ASCII character which should be encoded in 1 byte; as described below, such \"overlong\" sequences are disallowed. The red cells in the {{mono|F_}} row ({{mono|F5}} to {{mono|FD}}) indicate leading bytes of 4-byte or longer sequences that cannot be valid because they would encode code points larger than the U+10FFFF limit of Unicode (a limit derived from the maximum code point encodable in [[UTF-16]]), and {{mono|FE}} and {{mono|FF}} were never defined for any purpose in UTF-8.\n\n{{colorbox|#fcc}}{{nbsp}}Pink cells are the leading bytes for a sequence of multiple bytes, of which some, but not all, possible continuation sequences are valid. {{mono|E0}} and {{mono|F0}} could start overlong encodings, in this case the lowest non-overlong-encoded code point is shown. {{mono|F4}} can start code points greater than U+10FFFF which are invalid. {{mono|ED}} can start the encoding of a code point in the range U+D800\u2013U+DFFF; these are invalid since they are reserved for UTF-16 [[Universal Character Set characters#Surrogates|surrogate halves]].\n\n===Overlong encodings===\nIn principle, it would be possible to inflate the number of bytes in an encoding by padding the code point with leading 0s. To encode the Euro sign \u20ac from the above example in four bytes instead of three, it could be padded with leading 0s until it was 21&nbsp;bits long{{snd}} {{mono|000 000010 000010 101100}}, and encoded as {{mono|11110{{fontcolor|#C000C0|000}}}} {{mono|10{{fontcolor|blue|000010}}}} {{mono|10{{fontcolor|green|000010}}}} {{mono|10{{fontcolor|red|101100}}}} (or {{mono|{{fontcolor|#C000C0|F0}}}} {{mono|{{fontcolor|blue|82}}}} {{mono|{{fontcolor|green|82}}}} {{mono|{{fontcolor|red|AC}}}} in hexadecimal). This is called an ''overlong encoding''.\n\nThe standard specifies that the correct encoding of a code point use only the minimum number of bytes required to hold the significant bits of the code point. Longer encodings are called ''overlong'' and are not valid UTF-8 representations of the code point. This rule maintains a one-to-one correspondence between code points and their valid encodings, so that there is a unique valid encoding for each code point. This ensures that string comparisons and searches are well-defined.\n\n[[#Modified UTF-8|Modified UTF-8]] uses the two-byte overlong encoding of U+0000 (the [[Null character|NUL character]]) as {{mono|110{{fontcolor|green|00000}}}} {{mono|10{{fontcolor|red|000000}}}} (hexadecimal {{mono|{{fontcolor|green|C0}}}} {{mono|{{fontcolor|red|80}}}}) instead of {{mono|00000000}} (hexadecimal {{mono|00}}). This allows the byte {{mono|00}} to be used as a [[null-terminated string|string terminator]].\n\n===Invalid byte sequences===\nNot all sequences of bytes are valid UTF-8. A UTF-8 decoder should be prepared for:\n\n* the red invalid bytes in the above table\n* an unexpected continuation byte\n* a non-continuation byte before the end of the character\n* the string ending before the end of the character (which can happen in simple string truncation)\n* an overlong encoding as described above\n* a sequence that decodes to an invalid code point as described below\n\nMany of the first UTF-8 decoders would decode these, ignoring incorrect bits and accepting overlong results. Carefully crafted invalid UTF-8 could make them either skip or create ASCII characters such as NUL, slash, or quotes.

Replacement requires defining how many bytes are in the error:\n* Using the length defined by the lead byte (so that {{mono|E1,A0,C0}} is one error) is a bad idea, as a missing byte will cause the next character to become an error as well.\n* Since Unicode 6<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode6.0.0/ | title=Unicode 6.0.0}}</ref> (October 2010), the standard (chapter 3) has \u201crecommended\u201d a \"best practice\" where the error ends as soon as a disallowed byte is encountered. In these decoders {{mono|E1,A0,C0}} is two errors (2 bytes in the first one). This means an error is no more than three bytes long and never contains the start of a valid character, and there are 21,952 different possible errors.<ref>128 1-byte, (16+5)\u00d764 2-byte, and 5\u00d764\u00d764 3-byte. There may be somewhat fewer if more precise tests are done for each continuation byte.</ref> The standard also recommends replacing each error with the [[Specials (Unicode block)#Replacement character|replacement character]] \"\ufffd\" (U+FFFD).\n* Another popular practice is to turn each byte into an error. In this case {{mono|E1,A0,C0}} is three errors. This requires the UTF-8 parser to back up 2 bytes when an error is detected. The primary advantage is that there are now only 128 different errors. This allows the decoder to define 128 different error replacements such as:\n** The invalid Unicode code points U+DC80\u2013U+DCFF where the low eight bits are the byte's value.<ref name=\"Kuhn2000\">{{cite web |url=http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.comp.internationalization.linux/920|archiveurl=https://archive.fo/20150315055005/http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.comp.internationalization.linux/920|archivedate=2015-03-15|title=Substituting malformed UTF-8 sequences in a decoder |date=2000-07-23 |access-date=2014-09-25 |author-first=Markus |author-last=Kuhn |author-link=Markus Kuhn (computer scientist)}}</ref> Sometimes it is called UTF-8B.<ref name=\"Sittler2006\">{{cite web|url=http://bsittler.livejournal.com/10381.html |title=Binary vs. UTF-8, and why it need not matter |date=2006-04-02 |access-date=2014-09-25 |author-first=B. |author-last=Sittler |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140723192908/http://bsittler.livejournal.com/10381.html |archivedate=2014-07-23 |df= }}</ref> <!-- Python 3.0 error replacement value --> This has the nice property that it makes invalid UTF-8 into invalid UTF-16.\n** The Unicode code points U+0080\u2013U+00FF with the same value as the byte, thus interpreting the bytes according to [[ISO/IEC 8859-1|ISO-8859-1]]{{Citation needed |date=August 2014}}<!-- very common in Linux and OS/X text rendering --> Care must be taken so that the [[C1 control codes]] such as [[Newline|NEL]] 0x0085 do not cause further code to misbehave.\n** The Unicode code point for the character represented by the byte in [[Windows-1252|CP1252]],{{Citation needed |date=August 2014}}<!-- Most modern browsers --> which is similar to using ISO-8859-1, except most bytes in the range 0x80\u20130x9F turn into printing characters. For example, 0x80 becomes the Euro sign, U+20AC. This makes text where legacy encodings are mixed with UTF-8 readable, and thus it is commonly done in browsers.\n\nThe large number of invalid byte sequences provides the advantage of making it easy to have a program accept both UTF-8 and legacy encodings such as ISO-8859-1. Software can check for UTF-8 correctness, and if that fails assume the input to be in the legacy encoding. It is technically true that this may detect an ISO-8859-1 string as UTF-8, but this is very unlikely if it contains any 8-bit bytes as they ''all'' have to be in unusual patterns of two or more in a row, such as \"\u00c2\u00a3\".\n\n===Invalid code points===\nSince RFC 3629 (November 2003), the high and low surrogate halves used by [[UTF-16]] (U+D800 through U+DFFF) and code points not encodable by UTF-16 (those after U+10FFFF) are not legal Unicode values, and their UTF-8 encoding must be treated as an invalid byte sequence.\n\nNot decoding unpaired surrogate halves makes it impossible to store invalid UTF-16 (such as Windows filenames or UTF-16 that has been split between the surrogates) as UTF-8. To preserve these invalid UTF-16 sequences, their corresponding UTF-8 encodings are sometimes allowed by implementations despite the above rule. There are attempts to define this behavior formally (see WTF-8 and CESU below).\n\n===Byte order mark===\n{{Main|Byte order mark}}<!-- but several statements here are ''not'' (yet) mentioned in the main article! -->\n\nMany [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] programs (including older versions of Windows [[Notepad (Windows)|Notepad]]) add the bytes {{mono|0xEF}}, {{mono|0xBB}}, {{mono|0xBF}} at the start of any document saved as UTF-8. This is the UTF-8 encoding of the Unicode [[byte order mark]] (BOM), and is commonly referred to as a UTF-8 BOM, even though byte order is irrelevant to UTF-8. While ASCII text encoded using UTF-8 normally is backwards compatible with ASCII, this is not true when Unicode Standard recommendations are ignored and a BOM is added. Non-UTF-8 software may show the BOM as three garbage characters, e.g. \"{{mono|\u00ef\u00bb\u00bf}}\" in software interpreting the document as [[ISO 8859-1]] or [[Windows-1252]], and \"{{mono|\u2229\u2557\u2510}}\" if interpreted as [[code page 437]]. This is an example of [[mojibake]], the output of garbled text when text is  decoded using an unintended character encoding.\n\nThe Unicode Standard neither requires nor recommends the use of the BOM for UTF-8, but warns that it may be encountered at the start of a file transcoded from another encoding.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode6.0.0/ch02.pdf |title=The Unicode Standard \u2013 Chapter 2 |page=30}}</ref> The presence of the UTF-8 BOM may cause problems with existing software that can handle UTF-8, for example:\n\n* Programming language parsers not explicitly designed for UTF-8 can often handle UTF-8 in string constants and comments, but cannot parse the UTF-8 BOM at the start of the file. <!-- Any program that does not change bytes with the high bit set in a quoted string is UTF-8 compatible -->\n* Programs that identify file types by leading characters may fail to identify the file if a UTF-8 BOM is present even if the user of the file can handle the BOM. An example is the Unix [[Shebang (Unix)|shebang]] syntax, another is [[Internet Explorer]] which will render pages in standards mode only when it starts with a [[document type declaration]].{{Citation needed|reason=Which IE versions?|date=December 2016}}\n* Programs that insert information at the start of a file will break use of the BOM to identify UTF-8 (one example is [[offline browser]]s that add the originating URL to the start of the file{{Citation needed|reason=Which ones? All or most?|date=December 2016}}).\n\nNonetheless, some software such as text editors will refuse to correctly display or interpret UTF-8 unless the text starts with a byte order mark or it contains only ASCII.{{Citation needed|reason=Which software?|date=October 2019}}\n\n===Official name and variants===\nThe official [[Internet Assigned Numbers Authority]] (IANA) code for the encoding is \"UTF-8\".<ref name=\"IANA_2013_CS\"/> All letters are upper-case, and the name is hyphenated.

The draft [[Universal Coded Character Set|ISO 10646]] standard contained a non-required [[Addendum|annex]] called [[UTF-1]] that provided a byte stream encoding of its [[32-bit]] code points. This encoding was not satisfactory on performance grounds, among other problems, and the biggest problem was probably that it did not have a clear separation between ASCII and non-ASCII: new UTF-1 tools would be backward compatible with ASCII-encoded text, but UTF-1-encoded text could confuse existing code expecting ASCII (or [[extended ASCII]]), because it could contain continuation bytes in the range 0x21\u20130x7E that meant something else in ASCII, e.g., 0x2F for '/', the [[Unix]] [[Path (computing)|path]] directory separator, and this example is reflected in the name and introductory text of its replacement.

A modification by [[Ken Thompson]] of the [[Plan 9 from Bell Labs|Plan 9]] [[operating system]] group at [[Bell Labs]] made it somewhat less bit-efficient than the previous proposal but crucially allowed it to be [[Self-synchronizing code|self-synchronizing]], letting a reader start anywhere and immediately detect byte sequence boundaries. It also abandoned the use of biases and instead added the rule that only the shortest possible encoding is allowed; the additional loss in compactness is relatively insignificant, but readers now have to look out for invalid encodings to avoid reliability and especially security issues.

For many scripts there have been more than one single-byte encoding in usage, so even knowing the script was insufficient information to display it correctly.\n* The bytes 0xFE and 0xFF do not appear, so a valid UTF-8 stream never matches the UTF-16 [[byte order mark]] and thus cannot be confused with it. The absence of 0xFF (0377) also eliminates the need to escape this byte in [[Telnet]] (and FTP control connection).\n* UTF-8 encoded text is larger than specialized single-byte encodings except for plain ASCII characters. In the case of scripts which used 8-bit character sets with non-Latin characters encoded in the upper half (such as most [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]] and [[Greek alphabet]] code pages), characters in UTF-8 will be double the size. For some scripts, such as [[Thai alphabet|Thai]] and [[Devanagari]] (which is used by various South Asian languages), characters will triple in size. There are even examples where a single byte turns into a composite character in Unicode and is thus six times larger in UTF-8. This has caused objections in India and other countries.\n*  It is possible in UTF-8 (or any other variable-length encoding) to split or [[Data truncation|truncate]] a string in the middle of a character. If the two pieces are not re-appended later before interpretation as characters, this can introduce an invalid sequence at both the end of the previous section and the start of the next, and some decoders will not preserve these bytes and result in data loss. Because UTF-8 is self-synchronizing this will however never introduce a different valid character, and it is also fairly easy to move the truncation point backwards to the start of a character.\n* If the code points are all the same size, measurements of a fixed number of them is easy. Due to ASCII-era documentation where \"character\" is used as a synonym for \"byte\" this is often considered important. However, by measuring string positions using bytes instead of \"characters\" most algorithms can be easily and efficiently adapted for UTF-8. Searching for a string within a long string can for example be done byte by byte; the self-synchronization property prevents false positives.\n\n===Comparison with other multi-byte encodings===\n* UTF-8 can encode any [[Unicode]] character. Files in different scripts can be displayed correctly without having to choose the correct code page or font. For instance, Chinese and Arabic can be written in the same file without specialised markup or manual settings that specify an encoding.\n* UTF-8 is [[Self-synchronizing code|self-synchronizing]]: character boundaries are easily identified by scanning for well-defined bit patterns in either direction. If bytes are lost due to error or [[data corruption|corruption]], one can always locate the next valid character and resume processing. If there is a need to shorten a string to fit a specified field, the previous valid character can easily be found. Many multi-byte encodings such as {{nowrap|Shift JIS}} are much harder to resynchronize. This also means that [[byte-oriented protocol|byte-oriented]] [[string-searching algorithm]]s can be used with UTF-8 (as a character is the same as a \"word\" made up of that many bytes), optimized versions of byte searches can be much faster due to hardware support and lookup tables that have only 256 entries.\n* Efficient to encode using simple [[bitwise operation]]s. UTF-8 does not require slower mathematical operations such as multiplication or division (unlike {{nowrap|Shift JIS}}, {{nowrap|[[GB 2312]]}} and other encodings).\n* UTF-8 will take more space than a multi-byte encoding designed for a specific script. East Asian legacy encodings generally used two bytes per character yet take three bytes per character in UTF-8. Self-synchronization also takes more space.\n\n===Comparison with UTF-16===\n{{See also|Comparison of Unicode encodings}}\n\n* Byte encodings and UTF-8 are represented by byte arrays in programs, and often nothing needs to be done to a function when converting from a byte encoding to UTF-8. [[UTF-16]] is represented by 16-bit word arrays, and converting to UTF-16 while maintaining compatibility with existing [[ASCII]]-based programs (such as was done with Windows) requires ''every'' API and data structure that takes a string to be duplicated, one version accepting byte strings and another version accepting UTF-16.\n* Text encoded in UTF-8 will be smaller than the same text encoded in UTF-16 if there are more code points below U+0080 than in the range U+0800..U+FFFF. This is true for all modern European languages.\n** Text in (for example) Chinese, Japanese or Devanagari will take more space in UTF-8 if there are more of these characters than there are ASCII characters. This is likely when data mainly consist of pure prose, but is lessened by the degree to which the context uses ASCII whitespace, digits, and punctuation.<ref group=\"nb\">The 2010-11-22 version of [[:hi:\u092f\u0942\u0928\u093f\u0915\u094b\u0921|\u092f\u0942\u0928\u093f\u0915\u094b\u0921]] (Unicode in Hindi), when the pure text was pasted to Notepad, generated 19&nbsp;KB when saved as UTF-16 and 22&nbsp;KB when saved as UTF-8.</ref>\n** Most of the [[formatted text|rich text formats]] (including HTML) contain a large proportion of ASCII characters for the sake of formatting, thus the size usually will be reduced significantly compared with UTF-16, even when the language mostly uses 3-byte long characters in UTF-8.<ref group=\"nb\">The 2010-10-27 version of [[:ja:UTF-8|UTF-8]] (in Japanese) generated 169&nbsp;KB when converted with Notepad to UTF-16, and only 101&nbsp;KB when converted back to UTF-8.

A UTF-16 string must use a pair of bytes for each code unit:\n** The order of those two bytes becomes an issue and must be specified in the UTF-16 protocol, such as with a [[byte order mark]].\n** If an ''odd'' number of bytes is missing from UTF-16, the whole rest of the string will be meaningless text. Any bytes missing from UTF-8 will still allow the text to be recovered accurately starting with the next character after the missing bytes.\n\n==Derivatives==\nThe following implementations show slight differences from the UTF-8 specification. They are incompatible with the UTF-8 specification and may be rejected by conforming UTF-8 applications.\n\n===CESU-8===\n{{Main|CESU-8}}\n\nMany programs added UTF-8 conversions for [[UCS-2]] data and did not alter this UTF-8 conversion when UCS-2 was replaced with the surrogate-pair using [[UTF-16]]. In such programs each half of a UTF-16 surrogate pair is encoded as its own three-byte UTF-8 encoding, resulting in six-byte sequences rather than four bytes for characters outside the [[Basic Multilingual Plane]]. [[Oracle Database|Oracle]] and [[MySQL]] databases use this, as well as Java and Tcl as described below, and probably many Windows programs where the programmers were unaware of the complexities of UTF-16. Although this non-optimal encoding is generally not deliberate, a supposed benefit is that it preserves UTF-16 binary sorting order when CESU-8 is binary sorted.\n\n==={{anchor|MUTF-8}}Modified UTF-8===\nIn Modified UTF-8 (MUTF-8),<ref>{{cite web |title=Java SE documentation for Interface java.io.DataInput, subsection on Modified UTF-8 |url=https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/io/DataInput.html#modified-utf-8 |year=2015 |publisher=[[Oracle Corporation]] |access-date=2015-10-16}}</ref> the [[null character]] (U+0000) uses the two-byte overlong encoding {{mono|110{{fontcolor|green|00000}}}} {{mono|10{{fontcolor|red|000000}}}} (hexadecimal {{mono|{{fontcolor|green|C0}}}} {{mono|{{fontcolor|red|80}}}}), instead of {{mono|00000000}} (hexadecimal {{mono|00}}).

Code points with lower numerical values, which tend to occur more frequently, are encoded using fewer bytes.

Four bytes are needed for characters in the [[Plane (Unicode)|other planes of Unicode]], which include less common [[CJK characters]], various historic scripts, mathematical symbols, and [[emoji]] (pictographic symbols).\n\nSome of the important features of this encoding are as follows:\n\n* ''Backward compatibility:'' Backwards compatibility with ASCII and the enormous amount of software designed to process ASCII-encoded text was the main driving force behind the design of UTF-8. In UTF-8, single bytes with values in the range of 0 to 127 map directly to Unicode code points in the ASCII range. Single bytes in this range represent characters, as they do in ASCII. Moreover, 7-bit bytes (bytes where the most significant bit is 0) never appear in a multi-byte sequence, and no valid multi-byte sequence decodes to an ASCII code-point. A sequence of 7-bit bytes is both valid ASCII and valid UTF-8, and under either interpretation represents the same sequence of characters. Therefore, the 7-bit bytes in a UTF-8 stream represent all and only the ASCII characters in the stream. Thus, many text processors, parsers, protocols, file formats, text display programs, etc., which use ASCII characters for formatting and control purposes, will continue to work as intended by treating the UTF-8 byte stream as a sequence of single-byte characters, without decoding the multi-byte sequences. ASCII characters on which the processing turns, such as punctuation, whitespace, and control characters will never be encoded as multi-byte sequences. It is therefore safe for such processors to simply ignore or pass-through the multi-byte sequences, without decoding them. For example, ASCII whitespace may be used to [[tokenize]] a UTF-8 stream into words; ASCII line-feeds may be used to split a UTF-8 stream into lines; and ASCII NUL characters can be used to split UTF-8-encoded data into null-terminated strings. Similarly, many format strings used by library functions like \"printf\" will correctly handle UTF-8-encoded input arguments.\n* {{anchor|fallback and auto-detection}}''Fallback and auto-detection:'' UTF-8 provided backwards compatibility for 7-bit ASCII, but much software and data uses 8-bit [[extended ASCII]] encodings designed prior to the adoption of Unicode to represent the character sets of European languages. Part of the popularity of UTF-8 is due to the fact that it provides a form of backward compatibility for these as well. A UTF-8 processor which erroneously receives an [[extended ASCII]] file as input can \"fall back\" or replace 8-bit bytes using the appropriate code-point in the Unicode [[Latin-1 Supplement]] block, when the 8-bit byte appears outside a valid multi-byte sequence. The bytes in extended ASCII encodings of \u201creal world\u201d text are typically not legal UTF-8 multi-byte sequences. This is because the bytes which ''introduce'' multi-byte sequences in UTF-8 are primarily accented letters (mostly vowels) in the common extended ASCII encodings, and the UTF-8 ''continuation'' bytes are punctuation and symbol characters. To appear as a valid UTF-8 multi-byte sequence, a series of 2 to 4 extended ASCII 8-bit characters would have to be an unusual combination of symbols and accented letters (such as an accented vowel followed immediately by certain punctuation). In short, real-world extended ASCII character sequences which look like valid UTF-8 multi-byte sequences are unlikely. Fallback errors will be false negatives, and these will be rare. Moreover, in many applications, such as text display, the consequence of incorrect fallback is usually slight. Only legibility is affected, and only for a few characters. These two things make fallback feasible, if somewhat imperfect. Indeed, as discussed further below, the [[HTML5]] standard requires that erroneous bytes in supposed UTF-8 data be replaced upon display on the assumption that they are [[Windows-1252]] characters. The presence of invalid 8-bit characters outside valid multi-byte sequences can also be used to \"auto-detect\" that an encoding is actually an extended ASCII encoding rather than UTF-8, and decode it accordingly. A UTF-8 stream may simply contain errors, resulting in the auto-detection scheme producing false positives; but auto-detection is successful in the majority of cases, especially with longer texts, and is widely used.\n* ''[[Prefix code]]:'' The first byte indicates the number of bytes in the sequence. Reading from a stream can instantaneously decode each individual fully received sequence, without first having to wait for either the first byte of a next sequence or an end-of-stream indication. The length of multi-byte sequences is easily determined by humans as it is simply the number of high-order 1s in the leading byte. An incorrect character will not be decoded if a stream ends mid-sequence.\n* ''[[Self-synchronizing code|Self-synchronization]]:'' The leading bytes and the continuation bytes do not share values (continuation bytes start with {{mono|10}} while single bytes start with {{mono|0}} and longer lead bytes start with {{mono|11}}). This means a search will not accidentally find the sequence for one character starting in the middle of another character. It also means the start of a character can be found from a random position by backing up at most 3 bytes to find the leading byte. An incorrect character will not be decoded if a stream starts mid-sequence, and a shorter sequence will never appear inside a longer one.\n* ''Sorting order:'' The chosen values of the leading bytes means that a list of UTF-8 strings can be sorted in code point order by sorting the corresponding byte sequences.\n\n===Examples===\nConsider the encoding of the [[Euro sign]], \u20ac:\n\n# The Unicode code point for \"\u20ac\" is U+20AC.\n# According to the scheme table above, this will take three bytes to encode, since it is between U+0800 and U+FFFF.\n#[[Hexadecimal]] {{mono|20AC}} is binary {{mono|{{fontcolor|blue|0010}} {{fontcolor|green|0000 10}}{{fontcolor|red|10 1100}}}}. The two leading zeros are added because, as the scheme table shows, a three-byte encoding needs exactly sixteen bits from the code point.\n# Because the encoding will be three bytes long, its leading byte starts with three 1s, then a 0 ({{mono|1110...}})\n# The four most significant bits of the code point are stored in the remaining low order four bits of this byte ({{mono|1110 {{fontcolor|blue|0010}}}}), leaving 12 bits of the code point yet to be encoded ({{mono|...{{fontcolor|green|0000 10}}{{fontcolor|red|10 1100}}}}).\n# All continuation bytes contain exactly six bits from the code point. So the next six bits of the code point are stored in the low order six bits of the next byte, and {{mono|10}} is stored in the high order two bits to mark it as a continuation byte (so {{mono|10{{fontcolor|green|00 0010}}}}).\n# Finally the last six bits of the code point are stored in the low order six bits of the final byte, and again {{mono|10}} is stored in the high order two bits ({{mono|10{{fontcolor|red|10 1100}}}}).\n\nThe three bytes {{mono|1110 {{fontcolor|blue|0010}}}} {{mono|10{{fontcolor|green|00 0010}}}} {{mono|10{{fontcolor|red|10 1100}}}} can be more concisely written in [[hexadecimal]], as {{mono|{{fontcolor|blue|E2}} {{fontcolor|green|82}} {{fontcolor|red|AC}}}}.\n\nThe following table summarises this conversion, as well as others with different lengths in UTF-8. The colors indicate how bits from the code point are distributed among the UTF-8 bytes. Additional bits added by the UTF-8 encoding process are shown in black.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! colspan=2 rowspan=2 | Character\n! colspan=2 | Code point\n! colspan=3 | UTF-8\n|-\n! Octal\n!

The first two red cells ({{mono|C0}} and {{mono|C1}}) could be used only for a 2-byte encoding of a 7-bit ASCII character which should be encoded in 1 byte; as described below, such \"overlong\" sequences are disallowed. The red cells in the {{mono|F_}} row ({{mono|F5}} to {{mono|FD}}) indicate leading bytes of 4-byte or longer sequences that cannot be valid because they would encode code points larger than the U+10FFFF limit of Unicode (a limit derived from the maximum code point encodable in [[UTF-16]]), and {{mono|FE}} and {{mono|FF}} were never defined for any purpose in UTF-8.\n\n{{colorbox|#fcc}}{{nbsp}}Pink cells are the leading bytes for a sequence of multiple bytes, of which some, but not all, possible continuation sequences are valid. {{mono|E0}} and {{mono|F0}} could start overlong encodings, in this case the lowest non-overlong-encoded code point is shown. {{mono|F4}} can start code points greater than U+10FFFF which are invalid. {{mono|ED}} can start the encoding of a code point in the range U+D800\u2013U+DFFF; these are invalid since they are reserved for UTF-16 [[Universal Character Set characters#Surrogates|surrogate halves]].\n\n===Overlong encodings===\nIn principle, it would be possible to inflate the number of bytes in an encoding by padding the code point with leading 0s. To encode the Euro sign \u20ac from the above example in four bytes instead of three, it could be padded with leading 0s until it was 21&nbsp;bits long{{snd}} {{mono|000 000010 000010 101100}}, and encoded as {{mono|11110{{fontcolor|#C000C0|000}}}} {{mono|10{{fontcolor|blue|000010}}}} {{mono|10{{fontcolor|green|000010}}}} {{mono|10{{fontcolor|red|101100}}}} (or {{mono|{{fontcolor|#C000C0|F0}}}} {{mono|{{fontcolor|blue|82}}}} {{mono|{{fontcolor|green|82}}}} {{mono|{{fontcolor|red|AC}}}} in hexadecimal). This is called an ''overlong encoding''.\n\nThe standard specifies that the correct encoding of a code point use only the minimum number of bytes required to hold the significant bits of the code point. Longer encodings are called ''overlong'' and are not valid UTF-8 representations of the code point. This rule maintains a one-to-one correspondence between code points and their valid encodings, so that there is a unique valid encoding for each code point. This ensures that string comparisons and searches are well-defined.\n\n[[#Modified UTF-8|Modified UTF-8]] uses the two-byte overlong encoding of U+0000 (the [[Null character|NUL character]]) as {{mono|110{{fontcolor|green|00000}}}} {{mono|10{{fontcolor|red|000000}}}} (hexadecimal {{mono|{{fontcolor|green|C0}}}} {{mono|{{fontcolor|red|80}}}}) instead of {{mono|00000000}} (hexadecimal {{mono|00}}). This allows the byte {{mono|00}} to be used as a [[null-terminated string|string terminator]].\n\n===Invalid byte sequences===\nNot all sequences of bytes are valid UTF-8. A UTF-8 decoder should be prepared for:\n\n* the red invalid bytes in the above table\n* an unexpected continuation byte\n* a non-continuation byte before the end of the character\n* the string ending before the end of the character (which can happen in simple string truncation)\n* an overlong encoding as described above\n* a sequence that decodes to an invalid code point as described below\n\nMany of the first UTF-8 decoders would decode these, ignoring incorrect bits and accepting overlong results. Carefully crafted invalid UTF-8 could make them either skip or create ASCII characters such as NUL, slash, or quotes. Invalid UTF-8 has been used to bypass security validations in high-profile products including Microsoft's [[Internet Information Services|IIS]] web server<ref name=\"MS00-078\">{{cite web |url=https://www.sans.org/resources/malwarefaq/wnt-unicode.php |author-first=Marvin |author-last=Marin |title=Web Server Folder Traversal MS00-078 |date=2000-10-17}}</ref> and Apache's Tomcat servlet container.<ref name=\"CVE-2008-2938\">{{cite web |url=https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2008-2938 |title=National Vulnerability Database \u2013 Summary for CVE-2008-2938}}</ref> <nowiki>RFC 3629</nowiki> states \"Implementations of the decoding algorithm MUST protect against decoding invalid sequences.\"<ref name=\"rfc3629\">{{Cite RFC |author-first=F. |author-last=Yergeau |title=RFC 3629 \u2013 UTF-8, a transformation format of ISO 10646 |publisher=[[Internet Engineering Task Force]] |year=2003 |url=https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3629 |access-date=2015-02-03}}</ref> ''The Unicode Standard'' requires decoders to \"...treat any ill-formed code unit sequence as an error condition.

Replacement requires defining how many bytes are in the error:\n* Using the length defined by the lead byte (so that {{mono|E1,A0,C0}} is one error) is a bad idea, as a missing byte will cause the next character to become an error as well.\n* Since Unicode 6<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode6.0.0/ | title=Unicode 6.0.0}}</ref> (October 2010), the standard (chapter 3) has \u201crecommended\u201d a \"best practice\" where the error ends as soon as a disallowed byte is encountered. In these decoders {{mono|E1,A0,C0}} is two errors (2 bytes in the first one). This means an error is no more than three bytes long and never contains the start of a valid character, and there are 21,952 different possible errors.<ref>128 1-byte, (16+5)\u00d764 2-byte, and 5\u00d764\u00d764 3-byte. There may be somewhat fewer if more precise tests are done for each continuation byte.</ref> The standard also recommends replacing each error with the [[Specials (Unicode block)#Replacement character|replacement character]] \"\ufffd\" (U+FFFD).\n* Another popular practice is to turn each byte into an error. In this case {{mono|E1,A0,C0}} is three errors. This requires the UTF-8 parser to back up 2 bytes when an error is detected. The primary advantage is that there are now only 128 different errors. This allows the decoder to define 128 different error replacements such as:\n** The invalid Unicode code points U+DC80\u2013U+DCFF where the low eight bits are the byte's value.<ref name=\"Kuhn2000\">{{cite web |url=http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.comp.internationalization.linux/920|archiveurl=https://archive.fo/20150315055005/http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.comp.internationalization.linux/920|archivedate=2015-03-15|title=Substituting malformed UTF-8 sequences in a decoder |date=2000-07-23 |access-date=2014-09-25 |author-first=Markus |author-last=Kuhn |author-link=Markus Kuhn (computer scientist)}}</ref> Sometimes it is called UTF-8B.<ref name=\"Sittler2006\">{{cite web|url=http://bsittler.livejournal.com/10381.html |title=Binary vs. UTF-8, and why it need not matter |date=2006-04-02 |access-date=2014-09-25 |author-first=B. |author-last=Sittler |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140723192908/http://bsittler.livejournal.com/10381.html |archivedate=2014-07-23 |df= }}</ref> <!-- Python 3.0 error replacement value --> This has the nice property that it makes invalid UTF-8 into invalid UTF-16.\n** The Unicode code points U+0080\u2013U+00FF with the same value as the byte, thus interpreting the bytes according to [[ISO/IEC 8859-1|ISO-8859-1]]{{Citation needed |date=August 2014}}<!-- very common in Linux and OS/X text rendering --> Care must be taken so that the [[C1 control codes]] such as [[Newline|NEL]] 0x0085 do not cause further code to misbehave.\n** The Unicode code point for the character represented by the byte in [[Windows-1252|CP1252]],{{Citation needed |date=August 2014}}<!-- Most modern browsers --> which is similar to using ISO-8859-1, except most bytes in the range 0x80\u20130x9F turn into printing characters. For example, 0x80 becomes the Euro sign, U+20AC. This makes text where legacy encodings are mixed with UTF-8 readable, and thus it is commonly done in browsers.\n\nThe large number of invalid byte sequences provides the advantage of making it easy to have a program accept both UTF-8 and legacy encodings such as ISO-8859-1. Software can check for UTF-8 correctness, and if that fails assume the input to be in the legacy encoding. It is technically true that this may detect an ISO-8859-1 string as UTF-8, but this is very unlikely if it contains any 8-bit bytes as they ''all'' have to be in unusual patterns of two or more in a row, such as \"\u00c2\u00a3\".\n\n===Invalid code points===\nSince RFC 3629 (November 2003), the high and low surrogate halves used by [[UTF-16]] (U+D800 through U+DFFF) and code points not encodable by UTF-16 (those after U+10FFFF) are not legal Unicode values, and their UTF-8 encoding must be treated as an invalid byte sequence.\n\nNot decoding unpaired surrogate halves makes it impossible to store invalid UTF-16 (such as Windows filenames or UTF-16 that has been split between the surrogates) as UTF-8. To preserve these invalid UTF-16 sequences, their corresponding UTF-8 encodings are sometimes allowed by implementations despite the above rule. There are attempts to define this behavior formally (see WTF-8 and CESU below).\n\n===Byte order mark===\n{{Main|Byte order mark}}<!-- but several statements here are ''not'' (yet) mentioned in the main article! -->\n\nMany [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] programs (including older versions of Windows [[Notepad (Windows)|Notepad]]) add the bytes {{mono|0xEF}}, {{mono|0xBB}}, {{mono|0xBF}} at the start of any document saved as UTF-8. This is the UTF-8 encoding of the Unicode [[byte order mark]] (BOM), and is commonly referred to as a UTF-8 BOM, even though byte order is irrelevant to UTF-8. While ASCII text encoded using UTF-8 normally is backwards compatible with ASCII, this is not true when Unicode Standard recommendations are ignored and a BOM is added. Non-UTF-8 software may show the BOM as three garbage characters, e.g. \"{{mono|\u00ef\u00bb\u00bf}}\" in software interpreting the document as [[ISO 8859-1]] or [[Windows-1252]], and \"{{mono|\u2229\u2557\u2510}}\" if interpreted as [[code page 437]]. This is an example of [[mojibake]], the output of garbled text when text is  decoded using an unintended character encoding.\n\nThe Unicode Standard neither requires nor recommends the use of the BOM for UTF-8, but warns that it may be encountered at the start of a file transcoded from another encoding.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode6.0.0/ch02.pdf |title=The Unicode Standard \u2013 Chapter 2 |page=30}}</ref> The presence of the UTF-8 BOM may cause problems with existing software that can handle UTF-8, for example:\n\n* Programming language parsers not explicitly designed for UTF-8 can often handle UTF-8 in string constants and comments, but cannot parse the UTF-8 BOM at the start of the file. <!-- Any program that does not change bytes with the high bit set in a quoted string is UTF-8 compatible -->\n* Programs that identify file types by leading characters may fail to identify the file if a UTF-8 BOM is present even if the user of the file can handle the BOM. An example is the Unix [[Shebang (Unix)|shebang]] syntax, another is [[Internet Explorer]] which will render pages in standards mode only when it starts with a [[document type declaration]].{{Citation needed|reason=Which IE versions?|date=December 2016}}\n* Programs that insert information at the start of a file will break use of the BOM to identify UTF-8 (one example is [[offline browser]]s that add the originating URL to the start of the file{{Citation needed|reason=Which ones? All or most?|date=December 2016}}).\n\nNonetheless, some software such as text editors will refuse to correctly display or interpret UTF-8 unless the text starts with a byte order mark or it contains only ASCII.{{Citation needed|reason=Which software?|date=October 2019}}\n\n===Official name and variants===\nThe official [[Internet Assigned Numbers Authority]] (IANA) code for the encoding is \"UTF-8\".<ref name=\"IANA_2013_CS\"/> All letters are upper-case, and the name is hyphenated.

The draft [[Universal Coded Character Set|ISO 10646]] standard contained a non-required [[Addendum|annex]] called [[UTF-1]] that provided a byte stream encoding of its [[32-bit]] code points. This encoding was not satisfactory on performance grounds, among other problems, and the biggest problem was probably that it did not have a clear separation between ASCII and non-ASCII: new UTF-1 tools would be backward compatible with ASCII-encoded text, but UTF-1-encoded text could confuse existing code expecting ASCII (or [[extended ASCII]]), because it could contain continuation bytes in the range 0x21\u20130x7E that meant something else in ASCII, e.g., 0x2F for '/', the [[Unix]] [[Path (computing)|path]] directory separator, and this example is reflected in the name and introductory text of its replacement.

A modification by [[Ken Thompson]] of the [[Plan 9 from Bell Labs|Plan 9]] [[operating system]] group at [[Bell Labs]] made it somewhat less bit-efficient than the previous proposal but crucially allowed it to be [[Self-synchronizing code|self-synchronizing]], letting a reader start anywhere and immediately detect byte sequence boundaries. It also abandoned the use of biases and instead added the rule that only the shortest possible encoding is allowed; the additional loss in compactness is relatively insignificant, but readers now have to look out for invalid encodings to avoid reliability and especially security issues. Thompson's design was outlined on September 2, 1992, on a [[placemat]] in a New Jersey diner with [[Rob Pike]].

For many scripts there have been more than one single-byte encoding in usage, so even knowing the script was insufficient information to display it correctly.\n* The bytes 0xFE and 0xFF do not appear, so a valid UTF-8 stream never matches the UTF-16 [[byte order mark]] and thus cannot be confused with it. The absence of 0xFF (0377) also eliminates the need to escape this byte in [[Telnet]] (and FTP control connection).\n* UTF-8 encoded text is larger than specialized single-byte encodings except for plain ASCII characters. In the case of scripts which used 8-bit character sets with non-Latin characters encoded in the upper half (such as most [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]] and [[Greek alphabet]] code pages), characters in UTF-8 will be double the size. For some scripts, such as [[Thai alphabet|Thai]] and [[Devanagari]] (which is used by various South Asian languages), characters will triple in size. There are even examples where a single byte turns into a composite character in Unicode and is thus six times larger in UTF-8. This has caused objections in India and other countries.\n*  It is possible in UTF-8 (or any other variable-length encoding) to split or [[Data truncation|truncate]] a string in the middle of a character. If the two pieces are not re-appended later before interpretation as characters, this can introduce an invalid sequence at both the end of the previous section and the start of the next, and some decoders will not preserve these bytes and result in data loss. Because UTF-8 is self-synchronizing this will however never introduce a different valid character, and it is also fairly easy to move the truncation point backwards to the start of a character.\n* If the code points are all the same size, measurements of a fixed number of them is easy. Due to ASCII-era documentation where \"character\" is used as a synonym for \"byte\" this is often considered important. However, by measuring string positions using bytes instead of \"characters\" most algorithms can be easily and efficiently adapted for UTF-8. Searching for a string within a long string can for example be done byte by byte; the self-synchronization property prevents false positives.\n\n===Comparison with other multi-byte encodings===\n* UTF-8 can encode any [[Unicode]] character. Files in different scripts can be displayed correctly without having to choose the correct code page or font. For instance, Chinese and Arabic can be written in the same file without specialised markup or manual settings that specify an encoding.\n* UTF-8 is [[Self-synchronizing code|self-synchronizing]]: character boundaries are easily identified by scanning for well-defined bit patterns in either direction. If bytes are lost due to error or [[data corruption|corruption]], one can always locate the next valid character and resume processing. If there is a need to shorten a string to fit a specified field, the previous valid character can easily be found. Many multi-byte encodings such as {{nowrap|Shift JIS}} are much harder to resynchronize. This also means that [[byte-oriented protocol|byte-oriented]] [[string-searching algorithm]]s can be used with UTF-8 (as a character is the same as a \"word\" made up of that many bytes), optimized versions of byte searches can be much faster due to hardware support and lookup tables that have only 256 entries.\n* Efficient to encode using simple [[bitwise operation]]s. UTF-8 does not require slower mathematical operations such as multiplication or division (unlike {{nowrap|Shift JIS}}, {{nowrap|[[GB 2312]]}} and other encodings).\n* UTF-8 will take more space than a multi-byte encoding designed for a specific script. East Asian legacy encodings generally used two bytes per character yet take three bytes per character in UTF-8. Self-synchronization also takes more space.\n\n===Comparison with UTF-16===\n{{See also|Comparison of Unicode encodings}}\n\n* Byte encodings and UTF-8 are represented by byte arrays in programs, and often nothing needs to be done to a function when converting from a byte encoding to UTF-8. [[UTF-16]] is represented by 16-bit word arrays, and converting to UTF-16 while maintaining compatibility with existing [[ASCII]]-based programs (such as was done with Windows) requires ''every'' API and data structure that takes a string to be duplicated, one version accepting byte strings and another version accepting UTF-16.\n* Text encoded in UTF-8 will be smaller than the same text encoded in UTF-16 if there are more code points below U+0080 than in the range U+0800..U+FFFF. This is true for all modern European languages.\n** Text in (for example) Chinese, Japanese or Devanagari will take more space in UTF-8 if there are more of these characters than there are ASCII characters. This is likely when data mainly consist of pure prose, but is lessened by the degree to which the context uses ASCII whitespace, digits, and punctuation.<ref group=\"nb\">The 2010-11-22 version of [[:hi:\u092f\u0942\u0928\u093f\u0915\u094b\u0921|\u092f\u0942\u0928\u093f\u0915\u094b\u0921]] (Unicode in Hindi), when the pure text was pasted to Notepad, generated 19&nbsp;KB when saved as UTF-16 and 22&nbsp;KB when saved as UTF-8.</ref>\n** Most of the [[formatted text|rich text formats]] (including HTML) contain a large proportion of ASCII characters for the sake of formatting, thus the size usually will be reduced significantly compared with UTF-16, even when the language mostly uses 3-byte long characters in UTF-8.<ref group=\"nb\">The 2010-10-27 version of [[:ja:UTF-8|UTF-8]] (in Japanese) generated 169&nbsp;KB when converted with Notepad to UTF-16, and only 101&nbsp;KB when converted back to UTF-8.

A UTF-16 string must use a pair of bytes for each code unit:\n** The order of those two bytes becomes an issue and must be specified in the UTF-16 protocol, such as with a [[byte order mark]].\n** If an ''odd'' number of bytes is missing from UTF-16, the whole rest of the string will be meaningless text. Any bytes missing from UTF-8 will still allow the text to be recovered accurately starting with the next character after the missing bytes.\n\n==Derivatives==\nThe following implementations show slight differences from the UTF-8 specification. They are incompatible with the UTF-8 specification and may be rejected by conforming UTF-8 applications.\n\n===CESU-8===\n{{Main|CESU-8}}\n\nMany programs added UTF-8 conversions for [[UCS-2]] data and did not alter this UTF-8 conversion when UCS-2 was replaced with the surrogate-pair using [[UTF-16]]. In such programs each half of a UTF-16 surrogate pair is encoded as its own three-byte UTF-8 encoding, resulting in six-byte sequences rather than four bytes for characters outside the [[Basic Multilingual Plane]]. [[Oracle Database|Oracle]] and [[MySQL]] databases use this, as well as Java and Tcl as described below, and probably many Windows programs where the programmers were unaware of the complexities of UTF-16. Although this non-optimal encoding is generally not deliberate, a supposed benefit is that it preserves UTF-16 binary sorting order when CESU-8 is binary sorted.\n\n==={{anchor|MUTF-8}}Modified UTF-8===\nIn Modified UTF-8 (MUTF-8),<ref>{{cite web |title=Java SE documentation for Interface java.io.DataInput, subsection on Modified UTF-8 |url=https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/io/DataInput.html#modified-utf-8 |year=2015 |publisher=[[Oracle Corporation]] |access-date=2015-10-16}}</ref> the [[null character]] (U+0000) uses the two-byte overlong encoding {{mono|110{{fontcolor|green|00000}}}} {{mono|10{{fontcolor|red|000000}}}} (hexadecimal {{mono|{{fontcolor|green|C0}}}} {{mono|{{fontcolor|red|80}}}}), instead of {{mono|00000000}} (hexadecimal {{mono|00}}).
