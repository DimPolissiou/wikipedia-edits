The population of the city is 822,921.\n\nThe city is built on the slopes of Mt. [[Sefid Kooh]] and extended toward south during last two decades. The builtup areas run alongside [[Sarab River]] and [[Sarab Valley]]. City's elevation average about 1,350 meters above sea level.\n\nThe distance between Kermanshah and [[Tehran]] is 525&nbsp;km. It is the trade center of rich agricultural region that produces grain, rice, vegetable, fruits, and oilseeds, and there are many industrial centers, oil and sugar refineries, and cement, textile and flour factories, etc. The airport ([[Shahid Ashrafi Esfahani Airport]]) is located in north east of the city, and the distance from Tehran is 413&nbsp;km by air.\n\n== History ==\n\nThe province has a rich Paleolithic heritage. Many caves with [[Paleolithic]] remains have been surveyed or excavated there. some of these cave sites are located in Bisetun and north of Kermanshah. The first known physical remains of Neanderthal man in Iran was discovered in [[Bisitun Cave]]. [[Do-Ashkaft]], Kobeh, Warwasi, and Mar Tarik are some of the [[Middle Paleolithic]] sites in the region. [[Kermanshah]] also has many [[Neolithic]] sites, of which the most famous are [[Ganj Dareh]], Sarab, and Asiab. At Ganj Dareh, the earliest evidence for goat [[domestication]] have been documented. In May 2009, based on a research conducted by the University of [[Hamedan]] and [[University College London|UCL]], the head of Archeology Research Center of Iran's Cultural Heritage and Tourism Organization announced that the oldest prehistoric village in the Middle East dating back to 9800 B.C., was discovered in [[Sahneh County|Sahneh]], located in west of Kermanshah.<ref name=\"ISNA\">{{cite web | url =http://www.isna.ir/ISNA/NewsView.aspx?ID=News-1344672&Lang=E | title =Most ancient Mid East village discovered in western Iran | year =2009 | accessdate =2009-05-23 | url-status =dead | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20100201033414/http://www.isna.ir/ISNA/NewsView.aspx?ID=News-1344672&Lang=E | archivedate =1 February 2010 | df =dmy-all }}</ref><ref name=\"\u062e\u0628\u0631\u06af\u0632\u0627\u0631\u064a \u062f\u0627\u0646\u0634\u062c\u0648\u064a\u0627\u0646 \u0627\u064a\u0631\u0627\u0646\">{{cite web\n| url =http://kermanshah.isna.ir/mainnews.php?ID=News-22054 |title =\u0628\u0627 11800 \u0633\u0627\u0644 \u0642\u062f\u0645\u062a\u060c  \u0642\u062f\u064a\u0645\u064a\u200c\u062a\u0631\u064a\u0646 \u0631\u0648\u0633\u062a\u0627\u064a \u062e\u0627\u0648\u0631\u0645\u064a\u0627\u0646\u0647 \u062f\u0631 \u0643\u0631\u0645\u0627\u0646\u0634\u0627\u0647 \u0643\u0634\u0641 \u0634\u062f | year=2009 | accessdate=2009-05-23  }} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>\n\nThe monuments found in Kermanshah show two glorious periods, the [[Achaemenid]] and [[Sassanid]] eras. The mythical ruler of the [[Pishdadian]] is described as founding the city while [[Tahmores Divband]] built it. An alternative narrative is that the construction was by Bahram IV of the Sassanid dynasty during the 4th century CE. Kermanshah reached a peak during the reign of [[Hormizd IV]] and [[Khosrau I]] of Sassanids, before being demoted to a secondary royal residence.\n\nThe city suffered major damage during the Arab invasions but recovered in the [[Safavid]] period to make great progress. Concurrent with the Afghan attack and the fall of [[Isfahan (city)|Isfahan]], Kermanshah was almost completely destroyed by the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] invasion.\n\nDuring the [[Iran\u2013Iraq War]] the province suffered heavy fighting. Most towns and cities were badly damaged and some like [[Sar-e Pol-e Zahab]] and [[Qhasr-e-Shirin]] were almost completely destroyed.\n\n[[File:Knight-Iran.JPG|thumb|<center>At the top panel [[Khosrow II]] is believed to be standing here in this relief at [[Taq-e Bostan]].

The Supreme Leader of Iran has blamed western interference.  Some female organizations such as The National Council of Resistance of Iran (NCRI) have taken partial credit for the organization of these protests.<ref>[http://www.women.ncr-iran.org/iran-women-news/4629-iran-women-keep-high-the-spirit-of-nationwide-protests \"Iran: Women keep high the spirit of nationwide protests\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180114083722/http://www.women.ncr-iran.org/iran-women-news/4629-iran-women-keep-high-the-spirit-of-nationwide-protests |date=14 January 2018 }}, ''The National Council of Resistance of Iran''</ref>\n\n== Climate ==\nAs it is situated between two cold and warm regions enjoys a moderate climate. Kermanshah has a moderate and mountainous climate. It rains most in winter and is moderately warm in summer. The annual rainfall is 500&nbsp;mm. The average temperature in the hottest months is above 22&nbsp;\u00b0C.\n\n===Higher education and research===\n# [http://www.kums.ac.ir/ Kermanshah University of Medical Sciences]\n# [[Razi University]]\n# Islamic Azad University of Kermanshah http://www.en.iauksh.ac.ir\n\n===Local products===\n\nKermanshah lends its name to a type of [[Persian carpet]] named after the region. It also has famous sweets made of rice, locally known as [[N\u00e2n berendji]]. The other famous Kermanshahi good is a special kind of oil, locally known as [[R\u00fcne D\u00e2n]] and globally in Iran known as [[Roghan Kermanshahi]]. The [[Giveh]] of Kermanshah known as ''Klash'' is the highest quality Giveh.\n\n== Historical attractions ==\nVarious attractions exist that date from the pre-Islamic era, such as the [[Kohneh Bridge]], to contemporary parks and museums. Some of the more popular sites are:\n* [[Bisotun]]: [[File:Darius I the Great's inscription.jpg|thumb|200px|right|[[Darius the Great]]'s Behistun inscription]]\n: [[Darius the Great]]'s inscription at Bisotun, which dates to 522 BCE, lies some 1300 meters high in the mountains, and counts as one of the most famous sites in Near Eastern [[archeology]]. The site is a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]],<ref>{{cite web|title=Iran's Bisotoon Historical Site Registered in World Heritage List|year=<!-- 14 July,-->2006|author=CHN Press release|url=http://www.payvand.com/news/06/jul/1130.html}}</ref> and has been attracting visitors for centuries. The Behistun inscription is to [[Old Persian|Old Persian cuneiform]] what the [[Rosetta Stone]] is to [[Egyptian hieroglyph]]s: the trilingual inscription (in Old Persian, [[Elamite]] and [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]]) was crucial in the decipherment of the script. The relief above the inscription depicts Darius facing nine rebels who objected to his crowning. At the king's feet lies [[Gaumata]]. The location of this important historical document is not coincidental: Gaumata, a usurper who is depicted as lying at Darius' feet, was a Medean and in Achaemenid times Behistun lay on the Medea-Parsa highway.\n\n[[File:Bistoon Kermanshah.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Hellenistic-era depiction of [[Verethragna|Bahram]] as Hercules.]]\n: Behistun is also notable for three reliefs at the foot of the hill that date from the Parthian era. Among them is a Hellenistic-era depiction of the divinity [[Verethragna|Bahram]] as the Greek hero Hercules, who reclines with a goblet in his hand, a club at his feet and a lion-skin beneath him. Because it lies on the route of an ancient highway, this life-size rock sculpture may reflect Bahram's status as patron divinity of travelers.\n* [[Taq-e Bostan]]:\n: The rock reliefs at Taq-e Bostan lie {{convert|4|mi|km|0|order=flip}} northeast of Kermanshah, where a spring gushes from a mountain cliff and empties into a large reflecting pool. One of the more impressive reliefs, inside the largest grotto (''ivan''), is the oversized depiction of Sassanid king [[Khosrau II]] (591\u2013628 CE), who appears mounted on his favorite charger, Shabdiz. Both the horse and the rider are arrayed in full battle armor.\n: There are two hunting scenes on complementary sides of the ''ivan'': one depicts an imperial boar hunt and the other depicting the king stalking deer. Elephants flush out the boar from a marshy lake for the king who stands poised with bow and arrow in hand while he is serenaded by female musicians following in other boats. These royal hunting scenes are narrative murals in stone are count among the most vivid of all Iranian rock reliefs.\n: The Taq-e Bostan reliefs are not limited to the Sassanid era. An upper relief depicts the 19th century [[Qajar dynasty|Qajar]] king Fath-Ali shah holding court.\n* The [[Kangavar]] archaeological complex: <!-- Caution: The Hellenic-style is *NOT* that of a temple, and have nothing whatsoever to do with Anahita. READ THE TEXT! -->\n: Kangavar is the site of the archaeological remains of a vast Hellenic-style edifice on a raised platform. The visible remains at the site date to early Sassanid times,<ref name=\"EI_Kangavar\">{{cite encyclopedia|last=Kleiss|first=Wolfram|title=Kangavar|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia Iranica|year=2005|location=Costa Mesa|publisher=Mazda|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/kangavar-1}}</ref> but the platform of the complex may be several centuries older. By the time excavation began in 1968, the complex had been preemptorily associated with a comment by [[Isidore of Charax]] who referred to a temple of [[Anahita]] at Concobar (the Greek name of Kangavar, which was then in [[Medes|Lower Medea]]). Despite archaeological findings to the contrary,<ref name=\"EI_Kangavar\" /> the association with the divinity of fertility, healing, and wisdom has made the site a popular tourist attraction. The vast edifice was built of enormous blocks of dressed stone with an imposing entrance of opposed staircases that may have been inspired by the Apadana in [[Persepolis]].\n\n==Notable people==\n[[File:Mirza Ahmad Khan Motazed-Dowleh Vaziri.jpg|200px|right|thumb|Mirza Ahmad Khan Motazed-Dowleh Vaziri]]\nOne of the renowned scientists and writers of this region is [[Al-Dinawari]] who was born at ''Dinawar'' north-east of [[Kermanshah]]. He lived in the 9th century and has written many books in [[astronomy]], [[botany]] and history.\nNotable people born in Kermansha include British author, [[Nobel prize]] winner, [[Doris Lessing]], whose father, a [[British army]] [[military officer|officer]], was stationed there at the time of her birth.\n[[Mirza Ahmad Khan Motazed-Dowleh Vaziri]] created the first [[printing office]] and founded the first private school of Kermanshahan.

The population of the city is 822,921.\n\nThe city is built on the slopes of Mt. [[Sefid Kooh]] and extended toward south during last two decades. The builtup areas run alongside [[Sarab River]] and [[Sarab Valley]]. City's elevation average about 1,350 meters above sea level.\n\nThe distance between Kermanshah and [[Tehran]] is 525&nbsp;km. It is the trade center of rich agricultural region that produces grain, rice, vegetable, fruits, and oilseeds, and there are many industrial centers, oil and sugar refineries, and cement, textile and flour factories, etc. The airport ([[Shahid Ashrafi Esfahani Airport]]) is located in north east of the city, and the distance from Tehran is 413&nbsp;km by air.\n\n== History ==\n\nThe province has a rich Paleolithic heritage. Many caves with [[Paleolithic]] remains have been surveyed or excavated there. some of these cave sites are located in Bisetun and north of Kermanshah. The first known physical remains of Neanderthal man in Iran was discovered in [[Bisitun Cave]]. [[Do-Ashkaft]], Kobeh, Warwasi, and Mar Tarik are some of the [[Middle Paleolithic]] sites in the region. [[Kermanshah]] also has many [[Neolithic]] sites, of which the most famous are [[Ganj Dareh]], Sarab, and Asiab. At Ganj Dareh, the earliest evidence for goat [[domestication]] have been documented. In May 2009, based on a research conducted by the University of [[Hamedan]] and [[University College London|UCL]], the head of Archeology Research Center of Iran's Cultural Heritage and Tourism Organization announced that the oldest prehistoric village in the Middle East dating back to 9800 B.C., was discovered in [[Sahneh County|Sahneh]], located in west of Kermanshah.<ref name=\"ISNA\">{{cite web | url =http://www.isna.ir/ISNA/NewsView.aspx?ID=News-1344672&Lang=E | title =Most ancient Mid East village discovered in western Iran | year =2009 | accessdate =2009-05-23 | url-status =dead | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20100201033414/http://www.isna.ir/ISNA/NewsView.aspx?ID=News-1344672&Lang=E | archivedate =1 February 2010 | df =dmy-all }}</ref><ref name=\"\u062e\u0628\u0631\u06af\u0632\u0627\u0631\u064a \u062f\u0627\u0646\u0634\u062c\u0648\u064a\u0627\u0646 \u0627\u064a\u0631\u0627\u0646\">{{cite web\n| url =http://kermanshah.isna.ir/mainnews.php?ID=News-22054 |title =\u0628\u0627 11800 \u0633\u0627\u0644 \u0642\u062f\u0645\u062a\u060c  \u0642\u062f\u064a\u0645\u064a\u200c\u062a\u0631\u064a\u0646 \u0631\u0648\u0633\u062a\u0627\u064a \u062e\u0627\u0648\u0631\u0645\u064a\u0627\u0646\u0647 \u062f\u0631 \u0643\u0631\u0645\u0627\u0646\u0634\u0627\u0647 \u0643\u0634\u0641 \u0634\u062f | year=2009 | accessdate=2009-05-23  }} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>\n\nThe monuments found in Kermanshah show two glorious periods, the [[Achaemenid]] and [[Sassanid]] eras. The mythical ruler of the [[Pishdadian]] is described as founding the city while [[Tahmores Divband]] built it. An alternative narrative is that the construction was by Bahram IV of the Sassanid dynasty during the 4th century CE. Kermanshah reached a peak during the reign of [[Hormizd IV]] and [[Khosrau I]] of Sassanids, before being demoted to a secondary royal residence.\n\nThe city suffered major damage during the Arab invasions but recovered in the [[Safavid]] period to make great progress. Concurrent with the Afghan attack and the fall of [[Isfahan (city)|Isfahan]], Kermanshah was almost completely destroyed by the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] invasion.\n\nDuring the [[Iran\u2013Iraq War]] the province suffered heavy fighting. Most towns and cities were badly damaged and some like [[Sar-e Pol-e Zahab]] and [[Qhasr-e-Shirin]] were almost completely destroyed.\n\n[[File:Knight-Iran.JPG|thumb|<center>At the top panel [[Khosrow II]] is believed to be standing here in this relief at [[Taq-e Bostan]].

The Supreme Leader of Iran has blamed western interference.  Some female organizations such as The National Council of Resistance of Iran (NCRI) have taken partial credit for the organization of these protests.<ref>[http://www.women.ncr-iran.org/iran-women-news/4629-iran-women-keep-high-the-spirit-of-nationwide-protests \"Iran: Women keep high the spirit of nationwide protests\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180114083722/http://www.women.ncr-iran.org/iran-women-news/4629-iran-women-keep-high-the-spirit-of-nationwide-protests |date=14 January 2018 }}, ''The National Council of Resistance of Iran''</ref>\n\n== Climate ==\nAs it is situated between two cold and warm regions enjoys a moderate climate. Kermanshah has a moderate and mountainous climate. It rains most in winter and is moderately warm in summer. The annual rainfall is 500&nbsp;mm. The average temperature in the hottest months is above 22&nbsp;\u00b0C.\n\n===Higher education and research===\n# [http://www.kums.ac.ir/ Kermanshah University of Medical Sciences]\n# [[Razi University]]\n# Islamic Azad University of Kermanshah http://www.en.iauksh.ac.ir\n\n===Local products===\n\nKermanshah lends its name to a type of [[Persian carpet]] named after the region. It also has famous sweets made of rice, locally known as [[N\u00e2n berendji]]. The other famous Kermanshahi good is a special kind of oil, locally known as [[R\u00fcne D\u00e2n]] and globally in Iran known as [[Roghan Kermanshahi]]. The [[Giveh]] of Kermanshah known as ''Klash'' is the highest quality Giveh.\n\n== Historical attractions ==\nVarious attractions exist that date from the pre-Islamic era, such as the [[Kohneh Bridge]], to contemporary parks and museums. Some of the more popular sites are:\n* [[Bisotun]]: [[File:Darius I the Great's inscription.jpg|thumb|200px|right|[[Darius the Great]]'s Behistun inscription]]\n: [[Darius the Great]]'s inscription at Bisotun, which dates to 522 BCE, lies some 1300 meters high in the mountains, and counts as one of the most famous sites in Near Eastern [[archeology]]. The site is a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]],<ref>{{cite web|title=Iran's Bisotoon Historical Site Registered in World Heritage List|year=<!-- 14 July,-->2006|author=CHN Press release|url=http://www.payvand.com/news/06/jul/1130.html}}</ref> and has been attracting visitors for centuries. The Behistun inscription is to [[Old Persian|Old Persian cuneiform]] what the [[Rosetta Stone]] is to [[Egyptian hieroglyph]]s: the trilingual inscription (in Old Persian, [[Elamite]] and [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]]) was crucial in the decipherment of the script. The relief above the inscription depicts Darius facing nine rebels who objected to his crowning. At the king's feet lies [[Gaumata]]. The location of this important historical document is not coincidental: Gaumata, a usurper who is depicted as lying at Darius' feet, was a Medean and in Achaemenid times Behistun lay on the Medea-Parsa highway.\n\n[[File:Bistoon Kermanshah.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Hellenistic-era depiction of [[Verethragna|Bahram]] as Hercules.]]\n: Behistun is also notable for three reliefs at the foot of the hill that date from the Parthian era. Among them is a Hellenistic-era depiction of the divinity [[Verethragna|Bahram]] as the Greek hero Hercules, who reclines with a goblet in his hand, a club at his feet and a lion-skin beneath him. Because it lies on the route of an ancient highway, this life-size rock sculpture may reflect Bahram's status as patron divinity of travelers.\n* [[Taq-e Bostan]]:\n: The rock reliefs at Taq-e Bostan lie {{convert|4|mi|km|0|order=flip}} northeast of Kermanshah, where a spring gushes from a mountain cliff and empties into a large reflecting pool. One of the more impressive reliefs, inside the largest grotto (''ivan''), is the oversized depiction of Sassanid king [[Khosrau II]] (591\u2013628 CE), who appears mounted on his favorite charger, Shabdiz. Both the horse and the rider are arrayed in full battle armor.\n: There are two hunting scenes on complementary sides of the ''ivan'': one depicts an imperial boar hunt and the other depicting the king stalking deer. Elephants flush out the boar from a marshy lake for the king who stands poised with bow and arrow in hand while he is serenaded by female musicians following in other boats. These royal hunting scenes are narrative murals in stone are count among the most vivid of all Iranian rock reliefs.\n: The Taq-e Bostan reliefs are not limited to the Sassanid era. An upper relief depicts the 19th century [[Qajar dynasty|Qajar]] king Fath-Ali shah holding court.\n* The [[Kangavar]] archaeological complex: <!-- Caution: The Hellenic-style is *NOT* that of a temple, and have nothing whatsoever to do with Anahita. READ THE TEXT! -->\n: Kangavar is the site of the archaeological remains of a vast Hellenic-style edifice on a raised platform. The visible remains at the site date to early Sassanid times,<ref name=\"EI_Kangavar\">{{cite encyclopedia|last=Kleiss|first=Wolfram|title=Kangavar|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia Iranica|year=2005|location=Costa Mesa|publisher=Mazda|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/kangavar-1}}</ref> but the platform of the complex may be several centuries older. By the time excavation began in 1968, the complex had been preemptorily associated with a comment by [[Isidore of Charax]] who referred to a temple of [[Anahita]] at Concobar (the Greek name of Kangavar, which was then in [[Medes|Lower Medea]]). Despite archaeological findings to the contrary,<ref name=\"EI_Kangavar\" /> the association with the divinity of fertility, healing, and wisdom has made the site a popular tourist attraction. The vast edifice was built of enormous blocks of dressed stone with an imposing entrance of opposed staircases that may have been inspired by the Apadana in [[Persepolis]].\n\n==Notable people==\n[[File:Mirza Ahmad Khan Motazed-Dowleh Vaziri.jpg|200px|right|thumb|Mirza Ahmad Khan Motazed-Dowleh Vaziri]]\nOne of the renowned scientists and writers of this region is [[Al-Dinawari]] who was born at ''Dinawar'' north-east of [[Kermanshah]].
