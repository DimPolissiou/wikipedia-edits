He is voiced by [[Dan Castellaneta]] and first appeared on television, along with the rest of his family, in ''[[The Tracey Ullman Show]]'' [[The Simpsons shorts|short]] \"[[Good Night (The Simpsons short)|Good Night]]\" on April 19, 1987. Homer was created and designed by cartoonist [[Matt Groening]] while he was waiting in the lobby of [[James L. Brooks]]' office. Groening had been called to pitch a series of shorts based on his comic strip ''[[Life in Hell]]'' but instead decided to create a new set of characters. He named the character after his father, Homer Groening. After appearing for three seasons on ''The Tracey Ullman Show'', the Simpson family got their own series on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]], which debuted December 17, 1989.\n\nAs patriarch of the [[Simpson family|eponymous family]], Homer and his wife [[Marge Simpson|Marge]] have three children: [[Bart Simpson|Bart]], [[Lisa Simpson|Lisa]] and [[Maggie Simpson|Maggie]]. As the family's provider, he works at the [[Springfield (The Simpsons)|Springfield Nuclear Power Plant]] as safety inspector. Homer embodies many [[Working class in the United States|American working class]] stereotypes: he is crude, overweight, incompetent, lazy, selfish, balding, clumsy, dim-witted, hot-tempered, childish, and addicted to beer, junk food and watching television. However, he often tries his hardest to be a decent man and is fiercely devoted to his family, especially when they need him the most. Despite the suburban [[Blue-collar worker|blue-collar]] routine of his life, he has had a number of remarkable experiences, including going to [[Outer space|space]], climbing the tallest mountain in Springfield by himself, fighting former President [[George H. W. Bush]] and winning a [[Grammy Award]] as a member of a barbershop quartet.\n\nIn the shorts and earlier episodes, Castellaneta voiced Homer with a loose impression of [[Walter Matthau]]; however, during the second and third seasons of the half-hour show, Homer's voice evolved to become more robust, to allow the expression of a fuller range of emotions. He has appeared in other media relating to ''The Simpsons''\u2014including video games, ''[[The Simpsons Movie]]'', [[The Simpsons Ride]], commercials, and comic books\u2014and inspired an entire line of merchandise. His signature catchphrase, the annoyed grunt \"[[D'oh!]]\", has been included in ''[[Oxford Dictionary of English|The New Oxford Dictionary of English]]'' since 1998 and the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' since 2001.\n\nHomer is one of the most influential characters in the history of television, and is widely considered to be an American [[cultural icon]]. The British newspaper ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' described him as \"The greatest comic creation of [modern] time\". He was named the greatest character \"of the last 20 years\" in 2010 by ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'', was ranked the second-greatest cartoon character by ''[[TV Guide]]'', behind [[Bugs Bunny]], and was voted the greatest television character of all time by [[Channel 4]] viewers. For voicing Homer, Castellaneta has won four [[Primetime Emmy Awards]] for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Voice-Over Performance|Outstanding Voice-Over Performance]] and a special-achievement [[Annie Award]]. In 2000, Homer and his family were awarded a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]].\n\n==Role in ''The Simpsons''==\nHomer Jay Simpson is the bumbling husband of Marge and father of Bart, Lisa and Maggie Simpson.{{sfn|Turner|2004|pp=78\u201379}} He is the son of [[Mona Simpson (The Simpsons)|Mona]] and [[Grampa Simpson|Abraham \"Grampa\" Simpson]].

He is voiced by [[Dan Castellaneta]] and first appeared on television, along with the rest of his family, in ''[[The Tracey Ullman Show]]'' [[The Simpsons shorts|short]] \"[[Good Night (The Simpsons short)|Good Night]]\" on April 19, 1987. Homer was created and designed by cartoonist [[Matt Groening]] while he was waiting in the lobby of [[James L. Brooks]]' office. Groening had been called to pitch a series of shorts based on his comic strip ''[[Life in Hell]]'' but instead decided to create a new set of characters. He named the character after his father, Homer Groening. After appearing for three seasons on ''The Tracey Ullman Show'', the Simpson family got their own series on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]], which debuted December 17, 1989.\n\nAs patriarch of the [[Simpson family|eponymous family]], Homer and his wife [[Marge Simpson|Marge]] have three children: [[Bart Simpson|Bart]], [[Lisa Simpson|Lisa]] and [[Maggie Simpson|Maggie]]. As the family's provider, he works at the [[Springfield (The Simpsons)|Springfield Nuclear Power Plant]] as safety inspector. Homer embodies many [[Working class in the United States|American working class]] stereotypes: he is crude, overweight, incompetent, lazy, selfish, balding, clumsy, dim-witted, hot-tempered, childish, and addicted to beer, junk food and watching television. However, he often tries his hardest to be a decent man and is fiercely devoted to his family, especially when they need him the most. Despite the suburban [[Blue-collar worker|blue-collar]] routine of his life, he has had a number of remarkable experiences, including going to [[Outer space|space]], climbing the tallest mountain in Springfield by himself, fighting former President [[George H. W. Bush]] and winning a [[Grammy Award]] as a member of a barbershop quartet.\n\nIn the shorts and earlier episodes, Castellaneta voiced Homer with a loose impression of [[Walter Matthau]]; however, during the second and third seasons of the half-hour show, Homer's voice evolved to become more robust, to allow the expression of a fuller range of emotions. He has appeared in other media relating to ''The Simpsons''\u2014including video games, ''[[The Simpsons Movie]]'', [[The Simpsons Ride]], commercials, and comic books\u2014and inspired an entire line of merchandise. His signature catchphrase, the annoyed grunt \"[[D'oh!]]\", has been included in ''[[Oxford Dictionary of English|The New Oxford Dictionary of English]]'' since 1998 and the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' since 2001.\n\nHomer is one of the most influential characters in the history of television, and is widely considered to be an American [[cultural icon]]. The British newspaper ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' described him as \"The greatest comic creation of [modern] time\". He was named the greatest character \"of the last 20 years\" in 2010 by ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'', was ranked the second-greatest cartoon character by ''[[TV Guide]]'', behind [[Bugs Bunny]], and was voted the greatest television character of all time by [[Channel 4]] viewers. For voicing Homer, Castellaneta has won four [[Primetime Emmy Awards]] for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Voice-Over Performance|Outstanding Voice-Over Performance]] and a special-achievement [[Annie Award]]. In 2000, Homer and his family were awarded a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]].\n\n==Role in ''The Simpsons''==\nHomer Jay Simpson is the bumbling husband of Marge and father of Bart, Lisa and Maggie Simpson.{{sfn|Turner|2004|pp=78\u201379}} He is the son of [[Mona Simpson (The Simpsons)|Mona]] and [[Grampa Simpson|Abraham \"Grampa\" Simpson]].

The first instance of Homer strangling Bart was in the short \"Family Portrait\". According to Groening, the rule was that Homer could only strangle Bart impulsively, never with premeditation,<ref>{{cite AV media|people=Groening, Matt (writer)|chapter=Commentary for \"[[Simpson and Delilah]]\"|title=The Simpsons: The Complete Second Season (DVD)|date=2002|location=Los Angeles, California|publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> because doing so \"seems sadistic.

The \"sidekick\" to Morse, Lewis is a [[Sergeant#Police 7|detective sergeant]] in the [[Thames Valley Police]], and appears in all 13 Morse novels. In the television adaptation, ''[[Inspector Morse (TV series)|Inspector Morse]]'', he is played by [[Kevin Whately]]. Following the conclusion of the series, Whately reprised the role as the lead character in ''[[Lewis (TV series)|Lewis]]'', in which the character has been promoted to the rank of inspector.\n\n==Character history==\n===''Inspector Morse''===\n{{main|Inspector Morse (TV series)}}\nLewis is a sergeant on the staff of the [[Thames Valley Police]] in [[Oxford, England]], and in ''Inspector Morse'' is assistant to the eponymous Detective Chief Inspector Morse. Although Lewis's given name is Robert (Robbie), he was rarely referred to as anything but \"Sergeant Lewis\" or \"Lewis.\"\n\nThe background and personality of Lewis&nbsp;\u2013 a working class, easygoing family man with a [[Geordie]] accent &nbsp;\u2013 is frequently contrasted with that of Morse&nbsp;\u2013 [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] educated, [[Received Pronunciation|RP-accented]], lifetime bachelor. Morse frequently uses these differences to insult or demean Lewis, perhaps from Morse's point of view in a playful manner, but Lewis is often not amused by the jabs. In his frustration, Lewis is often more in step with their joint superior [[Chief Superintendent Strange]], himself an evident supporter of Lewis; however, despite a great respect towards Strange, Lewis is always unflinchingly loyal to Morse and follows his lead.\n\nIn ''Inspector Morse'', Lewis is often shown following a hunch that Morse criticises, and in the end Lewis is usually proved correct, or at least more correct than Morse. Near the end of the television series, Lewis moves on in his career and takes a promotion.

The \"sidekick\" to Morse, Lewis is a [[Sergeant#Police 7|detective sergeant]] in the [[Thames Valley Police]], and appears in all 13 Morse novels. In the television adaptation, ''[[Inspector Morse (TV series)|Inspector Morse]]'', he is played by [[Kevin Whately]]. Following the conclusion of the series, Whately reprised the role as the lead character in ''[[Lewis (TV series)|Lewis]]'', in which the character has been promoted to the rank of inspector.\n\n==Character history==\n===''Inspector Morse''===\n{{main|Inspector Morse (TV series)}}\nLewis is a sergeant on the staff of the [[Thames Valley Police]] in [[Oxford, England]], and in ''Inspector Morse'' is assistant to the eponymous Detective Chief Inspector Morse. Although Lewis's given name is Robert (Robbie), he was rarely referred to as anything but \"Sergeant Lewis\" or \"Lewis.\"\n\nThe background and personality of Lewis&nbsp;\u2013 a working class, easygoing family man with a [[Geordie]] accent &nbsp;\u2013 is frequently contrasted with that of Morse&nbsp;\u2013 [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] educated, [[Received Pronunciation|RP-accented]], lifetime bachelor. Morse frequently uses these differences to insult or demean Lewis, perhaps from Morse's point of view in a playful manner, but Lewis is often not amused by the jabs. In his frustration, Lewis is often more in step with their joint superior [[Chief Superintendent Strange]], himself an evident supporter of Lewis; however, despite a great respect towards Strange, Lewis is always unflinchingly loyal to Morse and follows his lead.\n\nIn ''Inspector Morse'', Lewis is often shown following a hunch that Morse criticises, and in the end Lewis is usually proved correct, or at least more correct than Morse. Near the end of the television series, Lewis moves on in his career and takes a promotion. With the end of ''Inspector Morse'' and the death of its star, [[John Thaw]], Lewis's adventures had seemed to come to an end.\n\nIn the episode \"The Dead of Jericho\", Lewis tells Morse \"It's also my birthday\". The first victim is killed on 11 June, and this utterance occurs a few days to a week later.

At the opening celebration of the University in 1632, [[Johan Skytte]], the Swedish chancellor and practical founder of the University, said that  wished that \"even the peasants of this country could get their share of the watering springs of educational wealth.\" This statement is taken to be the beginning of [[agricultural education]] in Estonia.\n\nAfter the reopening of Tartu University in 1802, a Chair of Agriculture was founded under Prof. [[Johann Wilhelm Krause]]. Initially [[agronomy]] was taught in the Faculty of [[Philosophy]], later in the Faculty of [[Physics]] and [[Mathematics]]. This school was well known in Europe and Russia. When Tartu opened as an Estonian university in 1919, a Faculty of Agriculture, consisting of the Departments of Agronomy and Forestry, was founded. Experimental stations and trial plots, where students could undertake research work, also belonged to the faculty. A Faculty of Veterinary Science was founded based on the older [[Tartu Veterinary Institute]]. These two faculties formed the core of an independent university in 1951, the Estonian Agricultural Academy.\n\n[[File:Tarbatu Tartu laulupeo rongk\u00e4igus 2014.JPG|thumb|University folk dance ensemble Tarbatu]]\nThe Estonian Agricultural Academy was directly subordinate to the [[Soviet Union]] Ministry of Agriculture and prepared specialists in different fields of agriculture from agronomists and animal breeders to experts in the electrification of large farms. Work continued in this way until the end of the 1980s.\n\nAfter the regaining of Estonian independence in 1991, the Academy was renamed Estonian Agricultural University, and the institution restructured, also according to the radical changes in Estonian agriculture and forestry (such as the abolishment of [[kolkhoz]]es and [[sovkhoz]]es). New specialities like Environmental Protection, [[Landscape architecture|Landscape Architecture]], Production and Marketing of Agricultural Products, Landscape Protection and Preservation, Applied [[Hydrobiology]], Environmental [[Economics]] and Natural Resources Management were adopted.\n\nUp to the end of 2004, the University had six faculties (Agronomy, Agricultural Engineering, Economics & Social Sciences, Forestry, Rural Engineering, and Veterinary Sciences) and eight institutes (Estonian Agribiocentre, Estonian Plant Biotechnology Research Institute EVIKA, Forest Research Institute, Institute of Animal Science, Institute of Environmental Protection, Institute of Experimental Biology, [[Institute of Zoology and Botany]] and Polli Institute of Horticulture).\n\nHowever, the EAU was always in a limbo, not least under the influence of [[Europeanization]] after Estonia joining the [[European Union]] in 2004. Thus, in the same year the change to Estonian University of Life Sciences and refocusing was carried out, aimed at guaranteeing the institution's survival in the coming times.\n\n==See also==\n* ''[[Maa\u00fclikool]]''\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Notes==\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20060309234708/http://www.emu.ee/3301 History of Eesti Maa\u00fclikool]\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Estonian University of Life Sciences}}\n*[http://www.emu.ee Official website]\n*[http://www.bova-university.org Bova-University Network]\n\n{{Estonian universities}}\n{{Tartu landmarks}}\n{{coord|58|23|17|N|26|41|50|E|region:EE_type:edu|display=title|name=Estonian University of Life Sciences main building}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Agricultural universities and colleges]]\n[[Category:Universities and colleges in Estonia]]\n[[Category:Educational institutions established in 1951]]\n[[Category:1951 establishments in Estonia]]\n[[Category:Estonian University of Life Sciences| Estonian University of Life Sciences]]\n[[Category:Forestry in Estonia]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox University\n|name            =Estonian University of Life Sciences\n|native_name     =Eesti Maa\u00fclikool\n|image_name      =Eesti Maa\u00fclikool logo.svg\n|image_size      =280px\n|established     =1632/1951\n|rector          =[[Mait Klaassen]]\n|students        =4704\n|city            =[[Tartu]]\n|coor            ={{coord|58|23|17|N|26|41|50|E|region:EE_type:edu|display=inline|name=Estonian University of Life Sciences main building}}\n|country         =[[Estonia]]\n|affiliations    =\n|website         ={{url|http://www.emu.ee}}\n|address         =Kreutzwaldi 64<br/>51014 Tartu<br/>Estonia\n}}\nThe '''Estonian University of Life Sciences''' ([[Estonian language|Estonian]]: '''''Eesti Maa\u00fclikool''''', '''EM\u00dc'''), located in [[Tartu]], [[Estonia]], is the former Estonian Agricultural University, which was established in 1951 and renamed and restructured in November 2005.\n\nEesti Maa\u00fclikool is, by its own claim, the only [[university]] in Estonia whose priorities in academic and research activities provide the [[sustainable development]] of natural resources necessary for the existence of Man as well as the preservation of heritage and [[Habitat (ecology)|habitat]].

There were 983 employees, among them 228 lecturers and 159 researchers and senior researchers.<ref>[http://www.emu.ee/115001 Estonian University of Life Sciences in figures] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090901154915/http://www.emu.ee/115001 |date=2009-09-01 }}</ref>\n\nUniversity is ranked among top 100 universities in the world in the field of agriculture and forestry.<ref>[https://www.topuniversities.com/universities/estonian-university-life-sciences Estonian University of Life Sciences] topuniversities.com</ref>\n\n==Institutes==\n[[File:Puhtulaid 1.JPG|thumb|[[Puhtu biology station]]]]\nTeaching and research is carried out in five institutes: \n*Institute of Agricultural and Environmental Sciences\n*Institute of Veterinary Medicine and Animal Sciences\n*Institute of Forestry and Rural Engineering\n*Institute of Technology\n*Institute of Economics and Social Sciences.\n\n==History==\n[[File:T\u00e4htvere m\u00f5isahoone.jpg|thumb|Main building of the university]]\nThe roots of EM\u00dc are in the agricultural and forestry education and research carried out at the [[University of Tartu]]. At the opening celebration of the University in 1632, [[Johan Skytte]], the Swedish chancellor and practical founder of the University, said that  wished that \"even the peasants of this country could get their share of the watering springs of educational wealth.\" This statement is taken to be the beginning of [[agricultural education]] in Estonia.\n\nAfter the reopening of Tartu University in 1802, a Chair of Agriculture was founded under Prof. [[Johann Wilhelm Krause]]. Initially [[agronomy]] was taught in the Faculty of [[Philosophy]], later in the Faculty of [[Physics]] and [[Mathematics]]. This school was well known in Europe and Russia. When Tartu opened as an Estonian university in 1919, a Faculty of Agriculture, consisting of the Departments of Agronomy and Forestry, was founded. Experimental stations and trial plots, where students could undertake research work, also belonged to the faculty. A Faculty of Veterinary Science was founded based on the older [[Tartu Veterinary Institute]]. These two faculties formed the core of an independent university in 1951, the Estonian Agricultural Academy.\n\n[[File:Tarbatu Tartu laulupeo rongk\u00e4igus 2014.JPG|thumb|University folk dance ensemble Tarbatu]]\nThe Estonian Agricultural Academy was directly subordinate to the [[Soviet Union]] Ministry of Agriculture and prepared specialists in different fields of agriculture from agronomists and animal breeders to experts in the electrification of large farms. Work continued in this way until the end of the 1980s.\n\nAfter the regaining of Estonian independence in 1991, the Academy was renamed Estonian Agricultural University, and the institution restructured, also according to the radical changes in Estonian agriculture and forestry (such as the abolishment of [[kolkhoz]]es and [[sovkhoz]]es). New specialities like Environmental Protection, [[Landscape architecture|Landscape Architecture]], Production and Marketing of Agricultural Products, Landscape Protection and Preservation, Applied [[Hydrobiology]], Environmental [[Economics]] and Natural Resources Management were adopted.\n\nUp to the end of 2004, the University had six faculties (Agronomy, Agricultural Engineering, Economics & Social Sciences, Forestry, Rural Engineering, and Veterinary Sciences) and eight institutes (Estonian Agribiocentre, Estonian Plant Biotechnology Research Institute EVIKA, Forest Research Institute, Institute of Animal Science, Institute of Environmental Protection, Institute of Experimental Biology, [[Institute of Zoology and Botany]] and Polli Institute of Horticulture).\n\nHowever, the EAU was always in a limbo, not least under the influence of [[Europeanization]] after Estonia joining the [[European Union]] in 2004. Thus, in the same year the change to Estonian University of Life Sciences and refocusing was carried out, aimed at guaranteeing the institution's survival in the coming times.\n\n==See also==\n* ''[[Maa\u00fclikool]]''\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Notes==\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20060309234708/http://www.emu.ee/3301 History of Eesti Maa\u00fclikool]\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Estonian University of Life Sciences}}\n*[http://www.emu.ee Official website]\n*[http://www.bova-university.org Bova-University Network]\n\n{{Estonian universities}}\n{{Tartu landmarks}}\n{{coord|58|23|17|N|26|41|50|E|region:EE_type:edu|display=title|name=Estonian University of Life Sciences main building}}\n\n[[Category:Agricultural universities and colleges]]\n[[Category:Universities and colleges in Estonia]]\n[[Category:Educational institutions established in 1951]]\n[[Category:1951 establishments in Estonia]]\n[[Category:Estonian University of Life Sciences| Estonian University of Life Sciences]]\n[[Category:Forestry in Estonia]]\n", "name_user": "Ser Amantio di Nicolao", "label": "safe", "comment": "add authority control", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estonian_University_of_Life_Sciences"}

She is the lead ship of the [[Radiance-class cruise ship|''Radiance'' class]], which includes ''[[Jewel of the Seas]]'', ''[[Brilliance of the Seas]]'' and ''[[Serenade of the Seas]]''. All of the ''Radiance''-class ships have a [[gas turbine]] powertrain, which produces higher efficient speeds than other cruise ships, and [[air pollution|emission]]s to the air are much lower than cruise ships powered by [[diesel engine]]s.\n\n== Construction and career ==\nBuilt in 1998, the ship cost Royal Caribbean International about 338 million dollars to build. The ship is considered to be one of the more environmentally-friendly but less fuel-efficient. As one of the Radiance Class ships it contained more glass than any other Royal Caribbean ship when it was launched. It has over 700 balcony staterooms, a two level main dining room and a retractable glass roof over the solarium (adults-only) pool.\n\n''Radiance of the Seas'' was designed in Germany by [[Meyer Werft]] to cruise varied climates. The ship is faster than most cruise ships and has the ability to maneuver with the combination of the Azipod propulsion system, the powerful bow thrusters, and the dynamic positioning system. The ship is economically efficient through the design of the power plant consisting of two gas turbines and one steam turbine. The waste heat from each gas turbine is fed through a heat recovery steam generator, thus using the steam to power the steam turbine. Once electricity is generated from this power plant it then powers the external propulsion pods and thrusters.\n\nThe ship has many unique features, including a $6 million art collection and gyroscopically-stabilized pool tables. Royal Caribbean ships all include art in passenger areas; ''Radiance of the Seas'' has displayed art from over 100 artists around the world.\n\n''Radiance of the Seas'' is the first cruise ship to feature [[Billiard table|pool tables]] that are stabilized by a computer-controlled [[gyroscope]]. They adjust with the motion of the ship to keep the table-top level with the horizon. The vessel has the most glass of any Royal Caribbean ship. She has 10 dining choices, a rock-climbing wall, a mini-golf course, pools, and a water slide.\n\n=== Itinerary ===\nDuring the northern summer season, ''Radiance of the Seas'' operates in [[Alaska]].
