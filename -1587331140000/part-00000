Containment is undertaken in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to trace and isolate those infected as well as introduce other measures of infection control and vaccinations to stop the disease from spreading to the rest of the population. When it is no longer possible to contain the spread of the disease, efforts then move to the mitigation stage: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the healthcare system and society. A combination of both containment and mitigation measures may be undertaken at the same time.<ref name=\"NY0JD\" /> Suppression requires more extreme measures so as to reverse the pandemic by reducing the [[basic reproduction number]] to less than 1.<ref name=\"ImpCollege16mar2020\" />\n\nPart of managing an infectious disease outbreak is trying to decrease the epidemic peak, known as flattening the epidemic curve.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> This decreases the risk of health services being overwhelmed and provides more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> Non-pharmaceutical interventions that may manage the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing face masks, and self-quarantine; community measures aimed at physical distancing such as closing schools and cancelling mass gathering events; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such surface cleaning.<ref name=\"community mitigation\" />\n\nMore drastic actions aimed at containing the outbreak were taken in China once the severity of the outbreak became apparent, such as quarantining entire cities and imposing strict travel bans.<ref name=\"RwmYm\" /> Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus. South Korea introduced mass screening and localised quarantines, and issued alerts on the movements of infected individuals. Singapore provided financial support for those infected who quarantined themselves and imposed large fines for those who failed to do so. Taiwan increased face mask production and penalised hoarding of medical supplies.<ref name=\"shZdf\" />\n\nSimulations for Great Britain and the United States show that mitigation (slowing but not stopping epidemic spread) and suppression (reversing epidemic growth) have major challenges.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Optimal mitigation policies might reduce peak healthcare demand by 2/3 and deaths by half, but still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and health systems being overwhelmed.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Suppression can be preferred but needs to be maintained for as long as the virus is circulating in the human population (or until a vaccine becomes available), as transmission otherwise quickly rebounds when measures are relaxed. Long-term intervention to suppress the pandemic has considerable social and economic costs.<ref name=\"ImpCollege16mar2020\" />\n\n====Contact tracing====\n\n[[Contact tracing]] is an important method for health authorities to determine the source of an infection and to prevent further transmission.<ref name=\"web\" /> The use of location data from mobile phones by governments for this purpose has

Containment is undertaken in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to trace and isolate those infected as well as introduce other measures of infection control and vaccinations to stop the disease from spreading to the rest of the population. When it is no longer possible to contain the spread of the disease, efforts then move to the mitigation stage: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the healthcare system and society. A combination of both containment and mitigation measures may be undertaken at the same time.<ref name=\"NY0JD\" /> Suppression requires more extreme measures so as to reverse the pandemic by reducing the [[basic reproduction number]] to less than 1.<ref name=\"ImpCollege16mar2020\" />\n\nPart of managing an infectious disease outbreak is trying to decrease the epidemic peak, known as flattening the epidemic curve.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> This decreases the risk of health services being overwhelmed and provides more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> Non-pharmaceutical interventions that may manage the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing face masks, and self-quarantine; community measures aimed at physical distancing such as closing schools and cancelling mass gathering events; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such surface cleaning.<ref name=\"community mitigation\" />\n\nMore drastic actions aimed at containing the outbreak were taken in China once the severity of the outbreak became apparent, such as quarantining entire cities and imposing strict travel bans.<ref name=\"RwmYm\" /> Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus. South Korea introduced mass screening and localised quarantines, and issued alerts on the movements of infected individuals. Singapore provided financial support for those infected who quarantined themselves and imposed large fines for those who failed to do so. Taiwan increased face mask production and penalised hoarding of medical supplies.<ref name=\"shZdf\" />\n\nSimulations for Great Britain and the United States show that mitigation (slowing but not stopping epidemic spread) and suppression (reversing epidemic growth) have major challenges.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Optimal mitigation policies might reduce peak healthcare demand by 2/3 and deaths by half, but still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and health systems being overwhelmed.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Suppression can be preferred but needs to be maintained for as long as the virus is circulating in the human population (or until a vaccine becomes available), as transmission otherwise quickly rebounds when measures are relaxed. Long-term intervention to suppress the pandemic has considerable social and economic costs.<ref name=\"ImpCollege16mar2020\" />\n\n====Contact tracing====\n\n[[Contact tracing]] is an important method for health authorities to determine the source of an infection and to prevent further transmission.<ref name=\"web\" /> The use of location data from mobile phones by governments for this purpose has

St Veronica depicted holding up her veil is at the base of the smaller cross on the left and at the base of the cross on the right is a depiction of [[James, son of Zebedee]]. Below the three crosses and on the upper frieze we have, from left to right, Jesus standing before the yawning mouth of hell and then the scene in the Garden of Gethsemane where Jesus appears to Mary Magdalene. Finally we see Jesus being mocked. On the lower frieze and from left to right we have Jesus washing Saint Peter's feet, Jesus praying in the Garden of Olives and finally [[Christ in Majesty]]]]\n[[File:Map commune FR insee code 29252.png|thumb|Map showing location of Saint-Jean-Trolimon]]\n\n'''Calvary at Trono\u00ebn''' is a [[Calvary (sculpture)|calvary]] located at [[Saint-Jean-Trolimon]] in the Quimper arrondissement. It is located in the \"pays bigouden\", a particularly wind swept area of Brittany; the nearby chapelle was called the \"cath\u00e9drale des dunes\".\n\n==History of the calvary==\nThe calvary dates to between 1450 and 1460 and stands on the grass verge (\"placitre\") in front of [[Saint-Jean-Trolimon]]'s Notre-Dame Chapel. It is the oldest of [[Finist\u00e8re]]'s six \"grands calvaires\" and is thought to be the work of several workshops operating in [[Sca\u00ebr]], mainly that of the \"Ma\u00eetre de Trono\u00ebn\". Several points emerge when this calvary is compared with the others in this region. Firstly there are two scenes devoted to Jesus' baptism. Then in the nativity scene, the statue of the baby Jesus shows him standing and aged about seven rather than as a new-born child. There are three crosses depicted, with those bearing the two robbers being a part of the composition. The calvary also depicts two angels collecting Jesus' blood. A \"mise au tombeau\", the scene showing Jesus being prepared for burial, a standard feature of other such calvaries, is not included and neither is the \"Flight into Egypt\", nor Jesus' entry into Jerusalem and his arrest. Conversely the subjects of the [[Last judgement]] and [[Garden of Eden]] are covered. The Notre-Dame Chapel dates to the 15th century. It replaced an ancient Romano-Gallic temple dedicated to the goddess [[Venus (mythology)]] and was thought to have been commissioned by the Pont barons.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.infobretagne.com/saint-jean-trolimon.htm|title=The Trono\u00ebn calvary|accessdate=6 February 2015}}</ref><ref name=jmc>{{cite web|url=http://u.jimdo.com/www62/o/sb7c488e3ce9a43b1/download/mbfc9a38aa9802642/1422814514/Calvaire+et+chapelle+de+Trono\u00ebn-Finist\u00e8re+-+JM+Clausse+..+16+12+2013.pps|title=feature on Trono\u00ebn calvary|accessdate=6 February 2015}}</ref><ref name=fb/>\n\n==Description of the calvary==\nThe calvary has suffered much erosion over the years, not surprisingly in view of its proximity to the sea and the sea's winds. This erosion does make some of the parts of the statuary difficult to interpret although it was restored in 2001. The calvary comprises a large rectangular granite pedestal or base which measures 4.50 m by 3.15 m. Around this base are two friezes on which are various sculptures, single or in groups, which recount some incidents in Jesus' life beginning with the [[Annunciation]] when the [[Archangel Gabriel]] tells the [[Virgin Mary]] that she is pregnant with [[Jesus]] Christ. The bulk of these statues are in granite except for the [[Visitation (Christianity)|Visitation]], the [[Nativity of Jesus|Nativity]] and the [[Adoration of the Magi]] where the local Kersanton stone was used. Kersanton is easier to carve and very resistant to erosion. Research suggests that several masons and workshops were responsible for these sculptures. There is clear evidence that the calvary was originally painted. Another oddity is that many of the sculptures are carved in blocks and some have suggested that they were originally carved for display as part of a church wall rather than for a calvary. Also, there is evidence that there had originally been some form of altar table on the eastern side of the calvary.\n\n==The three crosses==\n[[File:Bretagne.Tronoen.veronika.wmt.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Saint Veronica holds out her veil bearing Christ's image]]\n[[File:ND de Trono\u00ebn Calvaire D\u00e9tail 1.jpg|thumb|left|250px|St James at the base of the third cross. On his chest he wears a \"shell of Compostella\" and the typical hat of a pilgrim. Below Jesus can be seen being mocked and teased by two Roman soldiers.]]\nThere are three crosses involved at Trono\u00ebn, the central cross bearing [[Jesus Christ]] with the piet\u00e0 at its base whilst the two smaller crosses carry the two robbers executed alongside Jesus. At the base of the cross on the right of Jesus' cross is a sculpture showing [[St Veronica]] holding up her veil bearing Jesus' image and on the left is a depiction of  [[James, son of Zebedee]], wearing the typical dress of a pilgrim to [[Santiago del Compostella]], a pilgrim's staff and a sea-shell worn on his chest.<ref name=mh/>\n* In the piet\u00e0 the sculptor has added two angels at either side of the Virgin Mary.

It is located in the \"pays bigouden\", a particularly wind swept area of Brittany; the nearby chapelle was called the \"cath\u00e9drale des dunes\".\n\n==History of the calvary==\nThe calvary dates to between 1450 and 1460 and stands on the grass verge (\"placitre\") in front of [[Saint-Jean-Trolimon]]'s Notre-Dame Chapel. It is the oldest of [[Finist\u00e9re]]'s six \"grands calvaires\" and is thought to be the work of several workshops operating in [[Sca\u00ebr]], mainly that of the \"Ma\u00eetre de Trono\u00ebn\". Several points emerge when this calvary is compared with the others in this region. Firstly there are two scenes devoted to Jesus' baptism. Then in the nativity scene, the statue of the baby Jesus shows him standing and aged about seven rather than as a new-born child. There are three crosses depicted, with those bearing the two robbers being a part of the composition. The calvary also depicts two angels collecting Jesus' blood. A \"mise au tombeau\", the scene showing Jesus being prepared for burial, a standard feature of other such calvaries, is not included and neither is the \"Flight into Egypt\", nor Jesus' entry into Jerusalem and his arrest. Conversely the subjects of the [[Last judgement]] and [[Garden of Eden]] are covered. The Notre-Dame Chapel dates to the 15th century. It replaced an ancient Romano-Gallic temple dedicated to the goddess [[Venus (mythology)]] and was thought to have been commissioned by the Pont barons.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.infobretagne.com/saint-jean-trolimon.htm|title=The Trono\u00ebn calvary|accessdate=6 February 2015}}</ref><ref name=jmc>{{cite web|url=http://u.jimdo.com/www62/o/sb7c488e3ce9a43b1/download/mbfc9a38aa9802642/1422814514/Calvaire+et+chapelle+de+Trono\u00ebn-Finist\u00e8re+-+JM+Clausse+..+16+12+2013.pps|title=feature on Trono\u00ebn calvary|accessdate=6 February 2015}}</ref><ref name=fb/>\n\n==Description of the calvary==\nThe calvary has suffered much erosion over the years, not surprisingly in view of its proximity to the sea and the sea's winds. This erosion does make some of the parts of the statuary difficult to interpret although it was restored in 2001. The calvary comprises a large rectangular granite pedestal or base which measures 4.50 m by 3.15 m. Around this base are two friezes on which are various sculptures, single or in groups, which recount some incidents in Jesus' life beginning with the [[Annunciation]] when the [[Archangel Gabriel]] tells the [[Virgin Mary]] that she is pregnant with [[Jesus]] Christ. The bulk of these statues are in granite except for the [[Visitation (Christianity)|Visitation]], the [[Nativity of Jesus|Nativity]] and the [[Adoration of the Magi]] where the local Kersanton stone was used. Kersanton is easier to carve and very resistant to erosion. Research suggests that several masons and workshops were responsible for these sculptures. There is clear evidence that the calvary was originally painted. Another oddity is that many of the sculptures are carved in blocks and some have suggested that they were originally carved for display as part of a church wall rather than for a calvary. Also, there is evidence that there had originally been some form of altar table on the eastern side of the calvary.\n\n==The three crosses==\n[[File:Bretagne.Tronoen.veronika.wmt.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Saint Veronica holds out her veil bearing Christ's image]]\n[[File:ND de Trono\u00ebn Calvaire D\u00e9tail 1.jpg|thumb|left|250px|St James at the base of the third cross.

At the base of the cross on the right of Jesus' cross is a sculpture showing [[St Veronica]] holding up her veil bearing Jesus' image and on the left is a depiction of  [[James, son of Zebedee]], wearing the typical dress of a pilgrim to [[Santiago del Compostella]], a pilgrim's staff and a sea-shell worn on his chest.<ref name=mh/>\n* In the piet\u00e0 the sculptor has added two angels at either side of the Virgin Mary.

He teamed with the Ring Crew Express (Dunn and Marcos) in the ''Trios Tournament 2005'', losing to the Rottweilers. At ''Stalemate'', he lost to [[Roderick Strong]], then teaming with Sal Rinauro against [[The Embassy (professional wrestling)|The Embassy]] at ''New Frontiers'' (and losing). He only received a few more matches, losing to [[Austin Aries]] at ''Fate of an Angel'' and getting his first win against fellow IWS alumnus Kevin Steen at ''The Homecoming'' (a match that didn't even make it to the event's DVD). His final ROH match of this run was a loss to [[Homicide (wrestler)|Homicide]] at ''Dragon Gate Invasion''.\n\nGenerico returned to ROH in late 2006, making an appearance at ''Dethroned'', where he was defeated by [[Brent Albright]]. Following this, he took part in (and lost) a Four Corner Survival match to [[Jimmy Rave]] at ''Final Battle 2006''. In 2007, El Generico formed a permanent team with Kevin Steen, taking on the Briscoe Brothers at the ''Fifth Year Festival: Philly''. Much like many previous matches, they were defeated in this encounter, but the two men had a memorable showing that eventually earned them a full-time spot on the roster. Throughout 2007, the two teams feuded with one another, having several memorable matches including (but not limited to) a great match on the ''Driven'' pay-per-view, ROH's second-ever. Their feud came to an end following a brutal Street Fight at ''Death Before Dishonor V: Night 1'', a steel cage match at ''Caged Rage'', a two out of three falls match at ''Manhattan Mayhem 2'' and a ladder match advertised as a \"Ladder War\" at ''Man Up''.

He teamed with the Ring Crew Express (Dunn and Marcos) in the ''Trios Tournament 2005'', losing to the Rottweilers. At ''Stalemate'', he lost to [[Roderick Strong]], then teaming with Sal Rinauro against [[The Embassy (professional wrestling)|The Embassy]] at ''New Frontiers'' (and losing). He only received a few more matches, losing to [[Austin Aries]] at ''Fate of an Angel'' and getting his first win against fellow IWS alumnus Kevin Steen at ''The Homecoming'' (a match that didn't even make it to the event's DVD). His final ROH match of this run was a loss to [[Homicide (wrestler)|Homicide]] at ''Dragon Gate Invasion''.\n\nGenerico returned to ROH in late 2006, making an appearance at ''Dethroned'', where he was defeated by [[Brent Albright]]. Following this, he took part in (and lost) a Four Corner Survival match to [[Jimmy Rave]] at ''Final Battle 2006''. In 2007, El Generico formed a permanent team with Kevin Steen, taking on the Briscoe Brothers at the ''Fifth Year Festival: Philly''. Much like many previous matches, they were defeated in this encounter, but the two men had a memorable showing that eventually earned them a full-time spot on the roster. Throughout 2007, the two teams feuded with one another, having several memorable matches including (but not limited to) a great match on the ''Driven'' pay-per-view, ROH's second-ever. Their feud came to an end following a brutal Street Fight at ''Death Before Dishonor V: Night 1'', a steel cage match at ''Caged Rage'', a two out of three falls match at ''Manhattan Mayhem 2'' and a ladder match advertised as a \"Ladder War\" at ''Man Up''. This final match became the Main Event of ROH's third pay-per-view.\n\n[[File:El Generico in May 2008.jpg|thumb|left|250x|Generico in 2008]]\nAlso during this time, Generico broke out as a singles competitor, having a strong run in the Race to the Top Tournament of 2007. He defeated (in order) [[Delirious (wrestler)|Delirious]], Chris Hero and [[Davey Richards]], only to lose in the final match of the tournament to Claudio Castagnoli. After the feud with the Briscoes ended, Generico and Steen spent several months feuding with the Hangmen Three in an inconclusive feud that carried on into 2008. They also worked through the tag ranks and attempted to win the tag titles, but came up short in a tag title tournament at ''Up For Grabs''. Generico took ROH World champion [[Nigel McGuinness]] to the limit at ''Age of Insanity'', but eventually lost.\n\nOn September 19, 2008, Generico and Steen finally won the [[ROH World Tag Team Championship]] by beating [[The Age of the Fall]] at [[Driven (2008)|Driven]].<ref name=\"ROHtag\"/> Generico lost a second match to McGuinness at ''Glory by Honor VII''.

It was the primary locomotive pulling freight trains on the railroad until 1906, when the Sierra Railway purchased a new [[Baldwin Locomotive Works]] [[2-8-0]] locomotive.  It played a significant role in logging, mining and dam building operations in the Sierra foothills.\n\nOriginally built to burn coal, the locomotive was converted to burn oil sometime between 1900 and 1902.<ref name=Wyatt/>\n\nSierra No. 3 was involved in several wrecks.  In February 1898, a [[Railroad switch|switch]] mishap killed conductor William G. Bailey.<ref name=KW/> In September 1899, its tender derailed while backing up on a [[trestle]], causing it to collapse. [[File:Sierra Railway 3 1918 Derailment.jpg|thumb|left|No. 3's 1918 derailment that destroyed the original wooden cab.]] The locomotive turned on its side in 1918 just above Sonora, destroying its original wooden cab, which was replaced with a second-hand steel Southern Pacific Railroad cab in February 1919.<ref name=KW/>  Two years later, Sierra No. 3 made her first known Hollywood film appearance, in a silent film ''[[The Terror (1920 film)|The Terror]]'' starring [[Tom Mix]].\n\nDuring the [[Great Depression]], the Sierra Railway went into bankruptcy, and was reorganized as the [[Sierra Railroad Company]] in 1937.<ref name=Wyatt/>  Sierra No. 3 was taken out of service in 1932, and sat on a siding in the Jamestown yard for 15 years.<ref name=Railtown1/>  It managed to avoid being scrapped during World War II, and again received attention from Hollywood in 1946, when [[David O. Selznick]], the producer of ''[[Duel in the Sun (film)|Duel in the Sun]]'' being filmed on the Sierra Railroad, proposed to destroy her in a train wreck scene for the movie. The Sierra Railroad's Master Mechanic Bill Tremewan persuaded the railroad ownership not to consider a notion so \"ridiculous\", and instead shop crews restored the locomotive to operation for potential charter and movie service.<ref name=Wyatt/>  Inspection of the boiler proved it was in serviceable condition, however the resulting work required a reduction of the Maximum Allowable Working Pressure from {{convert|160|to|150|psi|MPa|2|abbr=on}}.  The rebuild was completed in 1948, and the locomotive officially returned to service heading a Railway and Locomotive Historical Society sponsored excursion train on May 30.  Over the next half-century, Sierra No. 3 pulled tourist excursion trains and appeared in dozens of films, TV shows, and commercials.  Among them were ''[[High Noon]]'' in 1952, for which [[Gary Cooper]] won the [[Academy Award for Best Actor]], and ''[[Unforgiven]]'', starring and directed by [[Clint Eastwood]], which won the [[Academy Award for Best Picture]] for 1992.\n[[File:Back to the Future III smokestack.jpg|thumb|Damaged smokestack used in the locomotive explosion scene in ''[[Back to the Future Part III]]''.]]\n\nThe locomotive was often redecorated for various movie and television appearances, one of its most famous roles being the ''[[Hooterville Cannonball]]'' from the mid-sixties series ''[[Petticoat Junction]]''. False [[Chimney (locomotive)|smokestacks]] were also often installed to alter the appearance of the locomotive.\n\nIn 1979, Crocker and Associates announced their intention to sell their interest in the railroad to Silverfoot, Inc. based in Chicago, but the deal did not include the locomotive facilities in Jamestown.<ref name=KW/>  The complex, including Sierra No. 3, was acquired by the State of California as a result of legislation passed in April 1981, and signed by Governor [[Jerry Brown]].  The acquisition was completed on September 15, 1982, and since then, the locomotive has been the property of the State of California.<ref name=Wyatt/>\n\nIn 1995, the [[Federal Railroad Administration]] issued new safety standards for steam locomotive boilers. In order to comply with these revised regulations, Sierra No. 3 was removed from service until a complete evaluation of the locomotive's condition could be made.\n\n==21st-century renovation==\n[[File:Old Sierra No. 3 - DH.jpg|thumb|Sierra No. 3 in the [[Railway roundhouse|roundhouse]] at [[Railtown 1897 State Historic Park]] in 2011]]\n[[File:Sierra No. 3 in roundhouse.jpg|thumb|Sierra No. 3 next to locomotives #28 & #34 in the [[Railway roundhouse|roundhouse]] at [[Railtown 1897 State Historic Park]]]]\n[[File:Sierra No 3 old boiler.jpg|thumb|left|Sierra Railway No. 3's original boiler that was replaced during a rebuild, photo taken 2011]]\n[[File:Movie Star Sierra 3.jpg|thumb|Renovated movie star Sierra No. 3. taken on [[Labor Day]] 2011]]\n\nPreliminary repairs were completed in 2000\u20132001 with deferred maintenance funding from the State of California.

Construction of the locomotive was completed on March 26th, 1891, and it was given Rogers construction number 4493. It has {{convert|17|x|24|in|cm|abbr=on}} cylinders, {{convert|56|in|cm|adj=on}} driving wheels and weighs {{convert|50|ST}} in working order.<ref name=Wyatt>{{cite web\n  | last = Wyatt\n  | first = Kyle\n  | authorlink = \n  | coauthors = \n  | title = Detailed History of the Sierra #3\n  | work = \n  | publisher = [[Railtown 1897 State Historic Park]]\n  | date = July 23, 2009\n  | url = https://railtown1897.wordpress.com/2009/07/23/detailed-history-of-the-sierra-3/\n  | doi = \n  | accessdate = June 7, 2011}}</ref>  It was built for the Prescott & Arizona Central Railway (P&AC) as their locomotive #3 and named ''W.N. Kelly'' after the company's treasurer. [[File:Prescott and Arizona Central 3.jpg|thumb|left|Sierra Railway #3 on the P&AC.]] The P&AC went bankrupt in 1893 and its owner, Thomas S. Bullock, relocated to California bringing much of his railroad equipment, including the No. 3.  He then entered into a partnership with Prince Andr\u00e9 Poniatowski and [[William H. Crocker]], and together in 1897 they incorporated the [[Sierra Railway Company of California]] to connect [[Oakdale, California]] with the timber producing regions of [[Tuolumne County]] and [[Calaveras County]].<ref name=KW>{{cite web\n  | last = Wyatt\n  | first = Kyle\n  | authorlink = \n  | coauthors = \n  | title = A History of Sierra Railway 4-6-0 No. 3 \n  | work = \n  | publisher = [[Railtown 1897 State Historic Park]]\n  | date = February 27, 1991\n  | url = http://railtown.team.parks.ca.gov/.../1/SRy%20Loco%203%20Article.doc\n  | format = Microsoft Word document\n  | doi = \n  | accessdate = June 8, 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe locomotive was then rechristened Sierra No. 3, and played a key role of the construction of the railroad to [[Jamestown, California]] in 1897, [[Sonora, California]] in 1899 and [[Tuolumne, California]] in 1900.  It was the primary locomotive pulling freight trains on the railroad until 1906, when the Sierra Railway purchased a new [[Baldwin Locomotive Works]] [[2-8-0]] locomotive.  It played a significant role in logging, mining and dam building operations in the Sierra foothills.\n\nOriginally built to burn coal, the locomotive was converted to burn oil sometime between 1900 and 1902.<ref name=Wyatt/>\n\nSierra No. 3 was involved in several wrecks.  In February 1898, a [[Railroad switch|switch]] mishap killed conductor William G. Bailey.<ref name=KW/> In September 1899, its tender derailed while backing up on a [[trestle]], causing it to collapse. [[File:Sierra Railway 3 1918 Derailment.jpg|thumb|left|No. 3's 1918 derailment that destroyed the original wooden cab.]] The locomotive turned on its side in 1918 just above Sonora, destroying its original wooden cab, which was replaced with a second-hand steel Southern Pacific Railroad cab in February 1919.<ref name=KW/>  Two years later, Sierra No. 3 made her first known Hollywood film appearance, in a silent film ''[[The Terror (1920 film)|The Terror]]'' starring [[Tom Mix]].\n\nDuring the [[Great Depression]], the Sierra Railway went into bankruptcy, and was reorganized as the [[Sierra Railroad Company]] in 1937.<ref name=Wyatt/>  Sierra No. 3 was taken out of service in 1932, and sat on a siding in the Jamestown yard for 15 years.<ref name=Railtown1/>  It managed to avoid being scrapped during World War II, and again received attention from Hollywood in 1946, when [[David O. Selznick]], the producer of ''[[Duel in the Sun (film)|Duel in the Sun]]'' being filmed on the Sierra Railroad, proposed to destroy her in a train wreck scene for the movie. The Sierra Railroad's Master Mechanic Bill Tremewan persuaded the railroad ownership not to consider a notion so \"ridiculous\", and instead shop crews restored the locomotive to operation for potential charter and movie service.<ref name=Wyatt/>  Inspection of the boiler proved it was in serviceable condition, however the resulting work required a reduction of the Maximum Allowable Working Pressure from {{convert|160|to|150|psi|MPa|2|abbr=on}}.  The rebuild was completed in 1948, and the locomotive officially returned to service heading a Railway and Locomotive Historical Society sponsored excursion train on May 30.  Over the next half-century, Sierra No. 3 pulled tourist excursion trains and appeared in dozens of films, TV shows, and commercials.  Among them were ''[[High Noon]]'' in 1952, for which [[Gary Cooper]] won the [[Academy Award for Best Actor]], and ''[[Unforgiven]]'', starring and directed by [[Clint Eastwood]], which won the [[Academy Award for Best Picture]] for 1992.\n[[File:Back to the Future III smokestack.jpg|thumb|Damaged smokestack used in the locomotive explosion scene in ''[[Back to the Future Part III]]''.]]\n\nThe locomotive was often redecorated for various movie and television appearances, one of its most famous roles being the ''[[Hooterville Cannonball]]'' from the mid-sixties series ''[[Petticoat Junction]]''. False [[Chimney (locomotive)|smokestacks]] were also often installed to alter the appearance of the locomotive.\n\nIn 1979, Crocker and Associates announced their intention to sell their interest in the railroad to Silverfoot, Inc. based in Chicago, but the deal did not include the locomotive facilities in Jamestown.<ref name=KW/>  The complex, including Sierra No. 3, was acquired by the State of California as a result of legislation passed in April 1981, and signed by Governor [[Jerry Brown]].  The acquisition was completed on September 15, 1982, and since then, the locomotive has been the property of the State of California.<ref name=Wyatt/>\n\nIn 1995, the [[Federal Railroad Administration]] issued new safety standards for steam locomotive boilers. In order to comply with these revised regulations, Sierra No. 3 was removed from service until a complete evaluation of the locomotive's condition could be made.\n\n==21st-century renovation==\n[[File:Old Sierra No. 3 - DH.jpg|thumb|Sierra No. 3 in the [[Railway roundhouse|roundhouse]] at [[Railtown 1897 State Historic Park]] in 2011]]\n[[File:Sierra No. 3 in roundhouse.jpg|thumb|Sierra No. 3 next to locomotives #28 & #34 in the [[Railway roundhouse|roundhouse]] at [[Railtown 1897 State Historic Park]]]]\n[[File:Sierra No 3 old boiler.jpg|thumb|left|Sierra Railway No. 3's original boiler that was replaced during a rebuild, photo taken 2011]]\n[[File:Movie Star Sierra 3.jpg|thumb|Renovated movie star Sierra No. 3. taken on [[Labor Day]] 2011]]\n\nPreliminary repairs were completed in 2000\u20132001 with deferred maintenance funding from the State of California.

The original ''[[Star Wars]]'' trilogy concluded with the 1983 film ''[[Return of the Jedi]]'', for which Williams's score provided most notably the \"[[Music of Star Wars#First appearance in Return of the Jedi|Emperor's Theme]]\", \"[[Music of Star Wars#First appearance in Return of the Jedi|Parade of the Ewoks]]\", and \"[[Music of Star Wars#First appearance in Return of the Jedi|Luke and Leia]]\".

Williams did not much like the film, but did not want to turn down the chance to work for Hitchcock. Hitchcock merely told him to remember one thing, \"Murder can be fun.\" Hitchcock was very satisfied with the result.\n\nWilliams worked with director [[Richard Donner]] to score the 1978 film ''[[Superman (1978 film)|Superman]]''. The score's heroic and romantic themes, particularly the main march, the Superman fanfare and the love theme, known as \"Can You Read My Mind,\" appeared in the four sequel films. For the 1981 film ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]'', created by Lucas and directed by Spielberg, Williams wrote a rousing main theme known as \"The Raiders March\" to accompany the film's hero, [[Indiana Jones]]. He composed separate themes to represent the [[Ark of the Covenant]], the character Marion, and the story's Nazi villains. Additional themes were featured in his scores to the subsequent ''[[Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom]]'', a prequel (1984), ''[[Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade]]'' (1989), and ''[[Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull]]'' (2008). Williams composed an emotional and sensitive score to Spielberg's 1982 fantasy film ''[[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial]]'', for which he was awarded a fourth Academy Award.<ref name=\"oscars\" />\n\nThe Spielberg-Williams collaboration resumed with the 1987 film ''[[Empire of the Sun (film)|Empire of the Sun]]'', and still continues, spanning genres from science fiction thrillers (1993's ''[[Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]])'' to somber tragedies (1993's ''[[Schindler's List]]'', 2005's ''[[Munich (film)|Munich]])'' to Eastern-tinged melodramas (2005's ''[[Memoirs of a Geisha (film)|Memoirs of a Geisha]]'', directed by [[Rob Marshall]]) to dramatic war films (1998's ''[[Saving Private Ryan]])''. Spielberg has said, \"I call it an honorable privilege to regard John Williams as a friend.\"<ref name=\"Spielberg_quote_cite\">{{cite AV media notes|last=Spielberg|first=Steven|authorlink=Steven Spielberg|title=Jurassic Park Audio CD (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack CD)|publisher=[[MCA Records|MCA]]|chapter=Back cover|year=1993}} \"...and I consider it a privilege to call John my Friend.\"</ref>\n\nIn 1999 Lucas launched the first of three prequels to the original ''Star Wars'' trilogy.

K. Rowling]]'s widely successful book series ''[[Harry Potter]]''. As with his ''Superman'' theme, the most important theme from Williams's scores for the ''Harry Potter'' films, \"Hedwig's Theme\", was used in the fourth through eighth films (''[[Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (film)|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire]]'', ''[[Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (film)|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix]]'', ''[[Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (film)|Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince]]'', ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows \u2013 Part 1]]'' and ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows \u2013 Part 2]]''), scored by [[Patrick Doyle]] (''Goblet of Fire''), [[Nicholas Hooper]] (''Order of the Phoenix'' and ''Half-Blood Prince'') and [[Alexandre Desplat]] (''Deathly Hallows''). Like the main themes from ''Jaws'', ''Star Wars'', ''Superman'', and ''Indiana Jones'', fans have come to identify the ''Harry Potter'' films with Williams's original compositions. Williams was asked to return to score the film franchise's final installment, ''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows \u2013 Part 2'', but director [[David Yates]] said that \"their schedules simply did not align\", as he would have had to provide Williams with a rough cut of the film sooner than was possible.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.mugglenet.com/2010/11/first-notes-from-deathly-hallows-part-1-junket-in-london/|title=First notes from Deathly Hallows - Part 1 junket in London|date=2010-11-12|website=MuggleNet|language=en-US|access-date=2019-12-12}}</ref>\n\nIn 2002, for the 20th anniversary edition of ''[[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial|E.T.

He received a Grammy nomination for his work on the film. ''Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull'' was also the only film score from the ''Indiana Jones'' film series not to be nominated for an Academy Award.

Williams did not much like the film, but did not want to turn down the chance to work for Hitchcock. Hitchcock merely told him to remember one thing, \"Murder can be fun.\" Hitchcock was very satisfied with the result.\n\nWilliams worked with director [[Richard Donner]] to score the 1978 film ''[[Superman (1978 film)|Superman]]''. The score's heroic and romantic themes, particularly the main march, the Superman fanfare and the love theme, known as \"Can You Read My Mind,\" appeared in the four sequel films. For the 1981 film ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]'', created by Lucas and directed by Spielberg, Williams wrote a rousing main theme known as \"The Raiders March\" to accompany the film's hero, [[Indiana Jones]]. He composed separate themes to represent the [[Ark of the Covenant]], the character Marion, and the story's Nazi villains. Additional themes were featured in his scores to the subsequent ''[[Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom]]'', a prequel (1984), ''[[Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade]]'' (1989), and ''[[Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull]]'' (2008). Williams composed an emotional and sensitive score to Spielberg's 1982 fantasy film ''[[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial]]'', for which he was awarded a fourth Academy Award.<ref name=\"oscars\" />\n\nThe Spielberg-Williams collaboration resumed with the 1987 film ''[[Empire of the Sun (film)|Empire of the Sun]]'', and still continues, spanning genres from science fiction thrillers (1993's ''[[Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]])'' to somber tragedies (1993's ''[[Schindler's List]]'', 2005's ''[[Munich (film)|Munich]])'' to Eastern-tinged melodramas (2005's ''[[Memoirs of a Geisha (film)|Memoirs of a Geisha]]'', directed by [[Rob Marshall]]) to dramatic war films (1998's ''[[Saving Private Ryan]])''.

Williams was asked to score all three, starting with ''[[Star Wars: Episode I \u2013 The Phantom Menace|The Phantom Menace]]''. Along with themes from the previous films, Williams created new themes to be used as leitmotifs in 2002's ''[[Star Wars: Episode II \u2013 Attack of the Clones|Attack of the Clones]]'' and 2005's ''[[Star Wars: Episode III \u2013 Revenge of the Sith|Revenge of the Sith]]''. Most notable of these was \"[[Duel of the Fates]]\", an aggressive choral movement in the style of [[Giuseppe Verdi|Verdi's]] [[Requiem (Verdi)|Requiem]],<ref>[http://h2g2.com/approved_entry/A563942 h2g2 The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy: Earth Edition John Williams \u2013 Film Composer Updated Feb 8, 2010] ''h2g2.com'' accessed June 1, 2019 \"Reminiscent of the 'Dies Irae' from Verdi's Requiem, 'Duel of the Fates' was written to accompany the climactic lightsabre battle in the first of the Star Wars prequels.

Also of note was \"Anakin's Theme\", which begins as an innocent childlike melody and morphs insidiously into a quote of the sinister \"Imperial March.\" For ''Episode II'' Williams composed \"Across the Stars\", a love theme for [[Padm\u00e9 Amidala]] and [[Anakin Skywalker]] (mirroring the love theme composed for ''The Empire Strikes Back'').<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.filmmusicnotes.com/celebrating-star-wars-themes-part-4-of-6-duel-of-the-fates/|title=Celebrating Star Wars Themes Part 4|first=Mark|last=Richards|publisher=Film Music Notes|date=2015-11-30|accessdate=2015-12-31}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.filmmusicnotes.com/celebrating-star-wars-themes-part-5-of-6-across-the-stars//|title=Celebrating Star Wars Themes Part 5|first=Mark|last=Richards|publisher=Film Music Notes|date=2015-11-30|accessdate=2015-12-31}}</ref> The final installment combined many of the themes created for the series' previous films, including \"The Emperor's Theme,\" \"The Imperial March\", \"Across the Stars\", \"Duel of the Fates\", \"The Force Theme\", \"Rebel Fanfare\", \"Luke's Theme\", and \"Princess Leia's Theme\", as well as new themes for [[General Grievous]] and the film's climax, titled \"Battle of the Heroes\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.filmmusicnotes.com/celebrating-star-wars-themes-part-6-of-6-battle-of-the-heroes/|title=Celebrating Star Wars Themes Part 6|first=Mark|last=Richards|publisher=Film Music Notes|date=2015-11-30|accessdate=2015-12-31}}</ref>\n\nIn the new millennium Williams scored the first three film adaptations of [[J. K. Rowling]]'s widely successful book series ''[[Harry Potter]]''. As with his ''Superman'' theme, the most important theme from Williams's scores for the ''Harry Potter'' films, \"Hedwig's Theme\", was used in the fourth through eighth films (''[[Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (film)|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire]]'', ''[[Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (film)|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix]]'', ''[[Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (film)|Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince]]'', ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows \u2013 Part 1]]'' and ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows \u2013 Part 2]]''), scored by [[Patrick Doyle]] (''Goblet of Fire''), [[Nicholas Hooper]] (''Order of the Phoenix'' and ''Half-Blood Prince'') and [[Alexandre Desplat]] (''Deathly Hallows''). Like the main themes from ''Jaws'', ''Star Wars'', ''Superman'', and ''Indiana Jones'', fans have come to identify the ''Harry Potter'' films with Williams's original compositions. Williams was asked to return to score the film franchise's final installment, ''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows \u2013 Part 2'', but director [[David Yates]] said that \"their schedules simply did not align\", as he would have had to provide Williams with a rough cut of the film sooner than was possible.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.mugglenet.com/2010/11/first-notes-from-deathly-hallows-part-1-junket-in-london/|title=First notes from Deathly Hallows - Part 1 junket in London|date=2010-11-12|website=MuggleNet|language=en-US|access-date=2019-12-12}}</ref>\n\nIn 2002, for the 20th anniversary edition of ''[[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial|E.T.

The player (one player only on the Master System version, up to two players on the Mega Drive version, three on the arcade version) selects from the three different characters to embark upon a quest to save the Earth from an alien invasion.\n\nAll of the Busters are playable from the beginning of the game. There are six missions to complete (eight in the Mega Drive version) with several stages, and each mission has the player blasting aliens, from the streets to the mother ship, where the mother of all aliens can be found. This task becomes increasingly difficult with each new mission, and the aliens are capable of hiding inside objects such as plants, post boxes, trash cans, drums, and other items. Each mission has an objective such as rescuing people or destroying a [[Unidentified flying object|UFO]].\n\nAfter defeating certain aliens, flying skulls will appear, which can be shot to collect life or energy. Energy is used specifically to power the energy-based attacks of the player's weapon (such as flames or electricity) and to use the much more powerful special weapons.\n\nIn a similar format as other early Sega arcade games, each character has unlimited usage of various short-range attacks, i.e. punches, kicks. Along with these standard attacks, each character has their own individual weapon (Garth's weapon that shoots lightning is replaced with a flame weapon in the Master System version). Special attacks are also included, and vary depending on the character chosen at the start of the game. For instance, Garth summons a [[United States Air Force|U.S. Air Force]] [[starship]] that drops bombs across the street (in the Master System version he has Karen's special, a [[ballistic missile]] strike). Scooter will teleport out of his present location and leave a series of bombs that will blow up on the appearance of aliens, after which he will re-appear (in the Mega Drive and arcade versions he just explodes, leaving his head, which his new body returns to retrieve). Karen calls down a nuclear missile, which incinerates every foe on the screen. However, a large amount of energy is depleted by using each character's special attack, and cannot be used if the energy of the player's character is too low.\n\nThere are few bosses in the game. The arcade original features an alien spaceship, an alien brain and a single boss in the middle of the game that has three distinct forms. This boss is repeated as a common enemy near the end of the last mission. The Mega Drive port has two of these forms as three separate bosses. At the end of each mission, the side-scrolling gameplay shifts to either a shooting gallery perspective where the player must take out the aliens that pop out of various locations, similar to the bonus stages of ''[[Shinobi (video game)|Shinobi]]'' and ''[[Shadow Dancer]]'', both by Sega, or a running section that is similar to the side-scrolling mode but plays like a horizontal shooter instead with projectile weapons.\n\n== Release ==\n\nIn October 1993,<ref name=\"AvSa\">{{cite web|url=https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/FSupp/869/783/1495595/|title=Atari Corp. v.

The player (one player only on the Master System version, up to two players on the Mega Drive version, three on the arcade version) selects from the three different characters to embark upon a quest to save the Earth from an alien invasion.\n\nAll of the Busters are playable from the beginning of the game. There are six missions to complete (eight in the Mega Drive version) with several stages, and each mission has the player blasting aliens, from the streets to the mother ship, where the mother of all aliens can be found. This task becomes increasingly difficult with each new mission, and the aliens are capable of hiding inside objects such as plants, post boxes, trash cans, drums, and other items. Each mission has an objective such as rescuing people or destroying a [[Unidentified flying object|UFO]].\n\nAfter defeating certain aliens, flying skulls will appear, which can be shot to collect life or energy. Energy is used specifically to power the energy-based attacks of the player's weapon (such as flames or electricity) and to use the much more powerful special weapons.\n\nIn a similar format as other early Sega arcade games, each character has unlimited usage of various short-range attacks, i.e. punches, kicks. Along with these standard attacks, each character has their own individual weapon (Garth's weapon that shoots lightning is replaced with a flame weapon in the Master System version). Special attacks are also included, and vary depending on the character chosen at the start of the game. For instance, Garth summons a [[United States Air Force|U.S. Air Force]] [[starship]] that drops bombs across the street (in the Master System version he has Karen's special, a [[ballistic missile]] strike). Scooter will teleport out of his present location and leave a series of bombs that will blow up on the appearance of aliens, after which he will re-appear (in the Mega Drive and arcade versions he just explodes, leaving his head, which his new body returns to retrieve). Karen calls down a nuclear missile, which incinerates every foe on the screen. However, a large amount of energy is depleted by using each character's special attack, and cannot be used if the energy of the player's character is too low.\n\nThere are few bosses in the game. The arcade original features an alien spaceship, an alien brain and a single boss in the middle of the game that has three distinct forms. This boss is repeated as a common enemy near the end of the last mission. The Mega Drive port has two of these forms as three separate bosses. At the end of each mission, the side-scrolling gameplay shifts to either a shooting gallery perspective where the player must take out the aliens that pop out of various locations, similar to the bonus stages of ''[[Shinobi (video game)|Shinobi]]'' and ''[[Shadow Dancer]]'', both by Sega, or a running section that is similar to the side-scrolling mode but plays like a horizontal shooter instead with projectile weapons.\n\n== Release ==\n\nIn October 1993,<ref name=\"AvSa\">{{cite web|url=https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/FSupp/869/783/1495595/|title=Atari Corp. v.
