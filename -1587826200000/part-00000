After about a year at a small advertising agency, she began working at the NBC network affiliate in New York City, WNBT-TV (now [[WNBC]]), doing publicity and writing press releases. She began producing a 15-minute children's program, ''Ask the Camera'', directed by [[Roone Arledge]] in 1953. She began producing for TV host [[Igor Cassini]]/[[Cholly Knickerbocker]]. However, she left the network after her boss pressured her to marry him and engaged in a fist-fight with a man she preferred to date.

WFL was a competitor with Ludwig and Ludwig. Conn combined their two drum brands into one in the early 1950s, forming Leedy & Ludwig, and then decided to quit the drum business altogether. In 1955, William and his son Bill Jr. were able to buy the Ludwig trademark back from Conn, and over the next few years their company and its products transitioned from the WFL brand to being called \"Ludwig\" again.\n\n{{Quote box\n |quote  = I stopped at that picture and asked why he (Ringo Starr) put our name on the front of his bass drum head.

He lives in [[Matale]] with his parents and sister. Due to their poverty, at the end of his school education he comes to [[Colombo]]. His father sends him to Senarath Maliyadde in order to get a job in his company. Senarath Maliyadde([[Buddhadasa Vithanarachchi]]) who lives in [[Nawala]] is a rich businessman and also a good friend of Dhanuka's father.\n\nSansala([[Udari Warnakulasooriya]]), Maliyadde's only daughter, is a beautiful proud girl in her late teenage. She just has her father and younger brother named Kasun. She received a marriage proposal from her aunt's son Saliya. She show little interest in Saliya. She spends her life happily but is sometimes maudlin about the death of her mother.\n\nAfter a long and arduous journey, Dhanuka arrives unheralded at Maliyadde's home.  Sansala opens the door to him and, considering him a perfect stranger, starts to question and blame him.  Dhanuka falls for her instantly. Maliyadde being out at the time and brother and sister knowing nothing of him, they leave Dhanuka at the gate notwithstanding a heavy downpour and he and his belongings are soaked. Maliyadde returns home in his car, spots Dhanuka by the gate and welcomes him in.

Karsh writes that at the same time Curzon wrote to [[Robert Vansittart, 1st Baron Vansittart|Vansittart]], stating: \"His Majesty's Government are already treating 'Trans-Jordania' as separate from the Damascus State, while at the same time avoiding any definite connection between it and Palestine, thus leaving the way open for the establishment there, should it become advisable, of some form of independent Arab government, perhaps by arrangement with King Hussein or other Arab chiefs concerned.\"}}{{efn|group=lower-alpha|1={{harvtxt|Wilson|1988|p=44}} Since the end of the war the territory north of Ma'an had been ruled by Damascus as a province of Faysal's Kingdom of Syria. Although it fell within the British zone according to the Sykes-Picot agreement, Britain was content with the arrangement because it favoured Arab rule in the interior and Faysal was, after all, British protege. However, when France occupied Damascus the picture changed dramatically. Britain did not want to see France extend its control southward to the borders of Palestine and closer to the Suez Canal.... It suddenly became important to know 'what is the \"Syria\" for which the French received a mandate at San Remo?' and 'does it include Transjordania?'... The British foreign secretary, Lord Curzon, decided that it did not and that Britain henceforth would regard the area as independent, but in 'closest relation' with Palestine.}}{{efn|group=lower-alpha|1={{harvtxt|Wilson|1988|pp=46\u201348}} Samuel then organised a meeting of Transjordanian leaders at Salt on 21 August, at which he would announce British plans... On 20 August Samuel and a few political officers left Jerusalem by car, headed for the Jordan river, the frontier of British territory at that time. \u2018It is an entirely irregular proceeding,\u2019 he noted, \u2018my going outside my own jurisdiction into a country which was Faisal's, and is still being administered by the Damascus Government, now under French influence. But it is equally irregular for a government under French influence to be exercising functions in territory which is agreed to be within the British sphere: and of the two irregularities I prefer mine.\u2019... The meeting, held in the courtyard of the Catholic church, was attended by about 600 people..... Sentence by sentence his speech describing British policy was translated into Arabic: political officers would be stationed in towns to help organise local governments; Transjordan would not come under Palestinian administration; there would be no conscription and no disarmament......On balance, Samuel's statement of policy was unobjectionable. Three things feared by the Arabs of Transjordan \u2013 conscription, disarmament, and annexation by Palestine \u2013 were abjured.... The presence of a few British agents, unsupported by troops, seemed a small concession in return for the protection Britain's presence would afford against the French, who, it was feared, might press their occupation southward... Samuel returned to Jerusalem well pleased with the success of his mission. He left behind several officers to see to the administration of Transjordan and the maintenance of British influence.}}{{efn|group=lower-alpha|1={{harvtxt|Wasserstein|2003|pp=105\u2013106}} \"Palestine, therefore, was not partitioned in 1921\u20131922.

Karsh writes that at the same time Curzon wrote to [[Robert Vansittart, 1st Baron Vansittart|Vansittart]], stating: \"His Majesty's Government are already treating 'Trans-Jordania' as separate from the Damascus State, while at the same time avoiding any definite connection between it and Palestine, thus leaving the way open for the establishment there, should it become advisable, of some form of independent Arab government, perhaps by arrangement with King Hussein or other Arab chiefs concerned.\"}}{{efn|group=lower-alpha|1={{harvtxt|Wilson|1988|p=44}} Since the end of the war the territory north of Ma'an had been ruled by Damascus as a province of Faysal's Kingdom of Syria. Although it fell within the British zone according to the Sykes-Picot agreement, Britain was content with the arrangement because it favoured Arab rule in the interior and Faysal was, after all, British protege. However, when France occupied Damascus the picture changed dramatically. Britain did not want to see France extend its control southward to the borders of Palestine and closer to the Suez Canal.... It suddenly became important to know 'what is the \"Syria\" for which the French received a mandate at San Remo?' and 'does it include Transjordania?'... The British foreign secretary, Lord Curzon, decided that it did not and that Britain henceforth would regard the area as independent, but in 'closest relation' with Palestine.}}{{efn|group=lower-alpha|1={{harvtxt|Wilson|1988|pp=46\u201348}} Samuel then organised a meeting of Transjordanian leaders at Salt on 21 August, at which he would announce British plans... On 20 August Samuel and a few political officers left Jerusalem by car, headed for the Jordan river, the frontier of British territory at that time. \u2018It is an entirely irregular proceeding,\u2019 he noted, \u2018my going outside my own jurisdiction into a country which was Faisal's, and is still being administered by the Damascus Government, now under French influence. But it is equally irregular for a government under French influence to be exercising functions in territory which is agreed to be within the British sphere: and of the two irregularities I prefer mine.\u2019... The meeting, held in the courtyard of the Catholic church, was attended by about 600 people..... Sentence by sentence his speech describing British policy was translated into Arabic: political officers would be stationed in towns to help organise local governments; Transjordan would not come under Palestinian administration; there would be no conscription and no disarmament......On balance, Samuel's statement of policy was unobjectionable. Three things feared by the Arabs of Transjordan \u2013 conscription, disarmament, and annexation by Palestine \u2013 were abjured.... The presence of a few British agents, unsupported by troops, seemed a small concession in return for the protection Britain's presence would afford against the French, who, it was feared, might press their occupation southward... Samuel returned to Jerusalem well pleased with the success of his mission. He left behind several officers to see to the administration of Transjordan and the maintenance of British influence.}}{{efn|group=lower-alpha|1={{harvtxt|Wasserstein|2003|pp=105\u2013106}} \"Palestine, therefore, was not partitioned in 1921\u20131922.
