In the late fourth century [[Evagrius Ponticus|Evagrius of Pontus]], for example, characterizes it as \"the most troublesome of all\" of the eight genera of evil thoughts. As with those who followed him, Evagrius sees acedia as a temptation, and the great danger lies in giving in to it. Evagrius' contemporary the [[Desert Father]] [[John Cassian]], depicted the apathetic restlessness of ''acedia'', \"the noonday demon\", in the [[Cenobitic monasticism|coenobitic]] monk:\n\n<blockquote>He looks about anxiously this way and that, and sighs that none of the brethren come to see him, and often goes in and out of his cell, and frequently gazes up at the sun, as if it was too slow in setting, and so a kind of unreasonable confusion of mind takes possession of him like some foul darkness.<ref>John Cassian, ''The Institutes'', (Boniface Ramsey, tr.) 2000:10:2, quoted in [[Stephen Greenblatt]], ''The Swerve: how the world became modern'', 2011:26.</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn the medieval Latin tradition of the [[seven deadly sins]], acedia has generally been folded into the sin of sloth. The [[Benedictine Rule]] directed that a monk displaying the outward signs of ''acedia'' should;-\n<blockquote>be reproved a first and a second time. If he does not amend he must be subjected to the [[Corporal punishment|punishment of the rule]] so that the others may have fear.<ref>''ut ceteri timeant'': ''The Rule of Benedict'' 48:19-20, quoted in Greenblatt 2011:26: \"The symptoms of psychic pain would be driven out by physical pain\".</ref></blockquote>\n==Aquinas' definition==\n\nThe ''Oxford Concise Dictionary of the Christian Church''<ref>\"[http://www.oxfordreference.com/views/ENTRY.html?subview=Main&entry=t95.e35 accidie]\"  ''The Concise Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church''. Ed. E. A. Livingstone. Oxford University Press, 2006. Oxford Reference Online. Oxford University Press. 1 November 2011</ref> defines acedia (or accidie) as \"a state of restlessness and inability either to work or to pray\". Some see it as the precursor to [[Sloth (deadly sin)|sloth]]\u2014one of the [[seven deadly sins]]. In his sustained analysis of the vice in Q. 35 of the ''Second Part (Secunda Secundae)'' of his ''[[Summa Theologica]]'', the 13th-century theologian [[Thomas Aquinas]] identifies acedia with \"the sorrow of the world\" (compare ''[[Weltschmerz]]'') that \"worketh death\" and contrasts it with that sorrow \"according to God\" described by [[Saint Paul|St. Paul]] in 2 Cor. 7:10. For Aquinas, acedia is \"sorrow about spiritual good in as much as it is a Divine good.\" It becomes a [[mortal sin]] when reason consents to man's \"flight\" (''fuga'') from the Divine good, \"on account of the flesh utterly prevailing over the spirit.\"<ref>''Summa'', II-II, 35, 3.</ref> Acedia is essentially a flight from the divine that leads to not even caring that one does not care. The ultimate expression of this is a despair that ends in [[suicide]].\n\nAquinas's teaching on acedia in Q. 35 contrasts with his prior teaching on charity's gifted \"spiritual joy\", to which acedia is directly opposed, and which he explores in Q. 28 of the ''Secunda Secundae''. As Aquinas says, \"One opposite is known through the other, as darkness through light. Hence also what evil is must be known from the nature of good.\"<ref>''Summa'', I, 48, 1.</ref>\n\n==Signs==\n[[Image:Kecske-templom 22.jpg|thumb|250px|Acedia depicted as a sleeping man and a bat in the Goat Church in [[Sopron]], Hungary.]]\nAcedia is indicated by a range of signs. These signs (or symptoms) are typically divided into two basic categories: somatic and psychological. Acedia frequently presents signs somatically. Such bodily symptoms range from mere sleepiness to general sickness or debility, along with a host of more specific symptoms: weakness in the knees, pain in the limbs, and fever.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}  An anecdote attributed to the [[Desert Mothers|Desert Mother Amma Theodora]]<ref>{{cite book|title=The Forgotten Desert Mothers: Sayings, Lives, and Stories of Early Christian Women|author=Laura Swan|publisher=Paulist Press|year=2001|isbn=978-0-8091-4016-9|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/forgottendesertm00laur}}</ref> also connects somatic pain and illness with the onset of acedia. A host of psychological symptoms can also signify the presence of acedia, which affects the mental state and behavior of the afflicted.  Some commonly reported psychological signs revolve around a lack of attention to daily tasks and an overall dissatisfaction with life. The best-known of the psychological signs of acedia is tedium, boredom or general laziness. Author [[Kathleen_Norris_(poet)|Kathleen Norris]] in her book ''Acedia and Me'' asserts that dictionary definitions such as torpor and sloth fail to do justice to this \"temptation\"; she believes a state of restlessness, of not living in the present and seeing the future as overwhelming is more accurate a definition than straight laziness: it is especially present in monasteries, due to the cutting off of distractions, but can invade any vocation where the labor is long, the rewards slow to appear, such as scientific research, long term marriages, etc. Another sign is a lack of caring, of being unfeeling about things, whether that be your appearance, hygiene, your relationships, your community's welfare, the world's welfare etc.; all of this, Norris relates, is connected to the hopelessness and vague unease that arises from having too many choices, lacking true commitment, of being \"a slave from within\". She relates this to forgetfulness about \"the one thing needful\": remembrance of God.\n\n==In culture==\n*Acedia plays an important role in the literary criticism of [[Walter Benjamin]].  In his study of [[baroque]] literature, ''[[The Origin of German Tragic Drama]]'', Benjamin describes acedia as a moral failing, an \"indolence of the heart\" that ruins great men. Benjamin considers acedia to be a key feature of many [[baroque]] tragic heroes, from the minor dramatic figures of German tragedy to Shakespeare's [[Hamlet]]: \"The indecisiveness of the prince, in particular, is nothing other than saturnine ''acedia.''\" It is this slothful inability to make decisions that leads baroque tragic heroes to passively accept their fate, rather than resisting it in the heroic manner of classical tragedy.<ref name=\"Benjam\u00ednOsborne2003\">{{cite book|author1=Walter Benjam\u00edn|author2=John Osborne|title=The origin of German tragic drama|url=https://archive.org/details/originofgermantr0000benj_y9z7|url-access=registration|accessdate=20 August 2011|year=2003|publisher=Verso|isbn=978-1-85984-413-7}}</ref>\n*[[Roger Fry]] saw acedia or gloominess as a twentieth century peril to be fought by a mixture of work and of determined pleasure in life.<ref>H. Lee, ''Virginia Wolff'' (1996) p. 708</ref>\n* [[Chekhov]] and [[Samuel Becket]]'s plays often have themes of acedia.\n*[[Aldous Huxley]] wrote an essay on acedia called \"Accidie\". A non-Christian, he examines \"the noon day demons\" original delineation by the Desert Fathers, and concludes that it is one of the main diseases of the modern age.\n*The writer David J. Cord claimed acedia can even affect an entire organization, and in ''[[The Decline and Fall of Nokia]]'' cites a culture of acedia as a prime cause for the collapse of [[Nokia]]'s mobile device unit.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Cord|first1=David|title=The Decline and Fall of Nokia|date=2014|publisher=Schildts & S\u00f6derstr\u00f6ms|isbn=978-951-52-3320-2|pages=244\u2013245}}</ref>\n*The [[Manic Street Preachers]] song Of Walking Abortion, which appears on their 1994 album [[The Holy Bible (album)|The Holy Bible]], refers in its lyrics to \"acedia's blackest hole\".

Benjamin considers acedia to be a key feature of many [[baroque]] tragic heroes, from the minor dramatic figures of German tragedy to Shakespeare's [[Hamlet]]: \"The indecisiveness of the prince, in particular, is nothing other than saturnine ''acedia.''\" It is this slothful inability to make decisions that leads baroque tragic heroes to passively accept their fate, rather than resisting it in the heroic manner of classical tragedy.<ref name=\"Benjam\u00ednOsborne2003\">{{cite book|author1=Walter Benjam\u00edn|author2=John Osborne|title=The origin of German tragic drama|url=https://archive.org/details/originofgermantr0000benj_y9z7|url-access=registration|accessdate=20 August 2011|year=2003|publisher=Verso|isbn=978-1-85984-413-7}}</ref>\n*[[Roger Fry]] saw acedia or gloominess as a twentieth century peril to be fought by a mixture of work and of determined pleasure in life.<ref>H. Lee, ''Virginia Wolff'' (1996) p. 708</ref>\n* [[Chekhov]] and [[Samuel Becket]]'s plays often have themes of acedia.\n*[[Aldous Huxley]] wrote an essay on acedia called \"Accidie\". A non-Christian, he examines \"the noon day demons\" original delineation by the Desert Fathers, and concludes that it is one of the main diseases of the modern age.\n*The writer David J. Cord claimed acedia can even affect an entire organization, and in ''[[The Decline and Fall of Nokia]]'' cites a culture of acedia as a prime cause for the collapse of [[Nokia]]'s mobile device unit.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Cord|first1=David|title=The Decline and Fall of Nokia|date=2014|publisher=Schildts & S\u00f6derstr\u00f6ms|isbn=978-951-52-3320-2|pages=244\u2013245}}</ref>\n*The [[Manic Street Preachers]] song Of Walking Abortion, which appears on their 1994 album [[The Holy Bible (album)|The Holy Bible]], refers in its lyrics to \"acedia's blackest hole\".
