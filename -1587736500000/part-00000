It is the 13th film in the [[Star Trek (film series)|''Star Trek'' film franchise]] and the third installment in [[Star Trek (film series)#The Kelvin Timeline|the reboot series]], following ''[[Star Trek (film)|Star Trek]]'' (2009) and ''[[Star Trek Into Darkness]]'' (2013).

At the [[89th Academy Awards]], the film was nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Makeup and Hairstyling|Best Makeup and Hairstyling]], but lost to ''[[Suicide Squad (film)|Suicide Squad]]''.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 to 700 words. -->\nThe Federation starship [[USS Enterprise (NCC-1701)|USS ''Enterprise'']] arrives at starbase ''Yorktown'', for resupply and [[shore leave]] for its crew. Struggling to find meaning in their exploration, Captain [[James T. Kirk]] has applied for a promotion to vice admiral; he recommends [[Spock]] as his replacement. Meanwhile, [[Hikaru Sulu]] reunites with his family, [[Scotty (Star Trek)|Montgomery Scott]] works to keep the ship operational, and Spock and [[Uhura|Nyota Uhura]] have ended their relationship; Spock also receives word from New Vulcan that Ambassador Spock has died.\n\n''Enterprise'' is dispatched on a rescue mission after an escape pod drifts out of a nearby uncharted nebula. Its occupant, Kalara, claims her ship is stranded on Altamid, a planet in the nebula. A massive swarm of small ships ambushes and quickly begins to tear the ''Enterprise'' apart. The swarm's leader, Krall, and his crew board the crippled ''Enterprise'', capture and kill many crew members, and attempt to capture the Abronath, a relic recovered during a recent mission. Kirk orders the crew to abandon ship, leaving the remains of the ''Enterprise'' saucer section to crash on Altamid.\n\nOn the planet, Krall captures Sulu, Uhura, and other survivors. Kirk and [[Pavel Chekov]], accompanied by Kalara, locate the ''Enterprise''{{'}}s saucer section. Knowing that Kalara knew they would be attacked, they trick her into revealing herself as Krall's spy. She is killed when Kirk and Chekov escape Krall's soldiers and flip the ''Enterprise'' saucer on Kalara. Elsewhere on the planet, Dr. [[Leonard McCoy]] and a wounded Spock search for other survivors. Spock explains to McCoy that the tension he witnessed between him and Uhura at ''Yorktown'' was due to his intention to leave [[Starfleet]] to help the Vulcan survivors, and continue the late Ambassador Spock's work. Jaylah, a scavenger who previously escaped Krall's encampment where her father was killed, rescues Scott and takes him to her makeshift home, the grounded {{USS|Franklin|NX-326|6}}, an early Starfleet vessel reported missing over a century earlier. Scott is reunited with Kirk, Chekov, McCoy and Spock. Krall coerces the ''Enterprise'' crew to hand over the Abronath, then uses it to complete an ancient [[biological agent|bioweapon]]. With the device complete, Krall intends to kill ''Yorktown''{{'}}s inhabitants, then use the base to attack the [[United Federation of Planets]]. Kirk and the others free the crew as Krall launches into space with the bioweapon, leading his drones to ''Yorktown''.\n\nThe ''Enterprise'' survivors power up the ''Franklin'' and launch her in pursuit of Krall. Theorizing the swarm's system may be vulnerable to high frequencies such as [[Very high frequency|VHF]] or [[radio]], they jam and destroy the swarm by broadcasting the song \"[[Sabotage (song)|Sabotage]]\" by the [[Beastie Boys]]. Krall is chased by the ''Franklin'' through ''Yorktown''. Uhura and Kirk discover from the ''Franklin''{{'}}s logs that Krall is actually Balthazar Edison, ''Franklin's'' former captain. A pre-Federation human soldier, Edison rejected the Federation's principles of unity and cooperation with former enemies like the [[Xindi (Star Trek)|Xindi]] and the [[Romulan (Star Trek)|Romulans]]. When he and his crew were stranded on Altamid by a wormhole, the survivors used the extinct natives' technology to prolong their lives at the cost of the others, and re-purposed the ancient race's dormant drone workers into the swarm. Thinking the Federation had abandoned them, Edison planned to destroy the Federation and resume galactic conflict. Kirk pursues Edison into ''Yorktown''{{'}}s ventilation system, where Edison activates the bioweapon. Before it can spread, Kirk ejects it and Edison into space, where the weapon kills Edison. Using an alien ship they commandeered, Spock and McCoy save Kirk moments before he is also blown into space.\n\nIn the aftermath, Commodore Paris closes the files of Captain Edison and the USS ''Franklin'' crew.

Struggling to find meaning in their exploration, Captain [[James T. Kirk]] has applied for a promotion to vice admiral; he recommends [[Spock]] as his replacement. Meanwhile, [[Hikaru Sulu]] reunites with his family, [[Scotty (Star Trek)|Montgomery Scott]] works to keep the ship operational, and Spock and [[Uhura|Nyota Uhura]] have ended their relationship; Spock also receives word from New Vulcan that Ambassador Spock has died.\n\n''Enterprise'' is dispatched on a rescue mission after an escape pod drifts out of a nearby uncharted nebula. Its occupant, Kalara, claims her ship is stranded on Altamid, a planet in the nebula. A massive swarm of small ships ambushes and quickly begins to tear the ''Enterprise'' apart. The swarm's leader, Krall, and his crew board the crippled ''Enterprise'', capture and kill many crew members, and attempt to capture the Abronath, a relic recovered during a recent mission. Kirk orders the crew to abandon ship, leaving the remains of the ''Enterprise'' saucer section to crash on Altamid.\n\nOn the planet, Krall captures Sulu, Uhura, and other survivors. Kirk and [[Pavel Chekov]], accompanied by Kalara, locate the ''Enterprise''{{'}}s saucer section. Knowing that Kalara knew they would be attacked, they trick her into revealing herself as Krall's spy. She is killed when Kirk and Chekov escape Krall's soldiers and flip the ''Enterprise'' saucer on Kalara. Elsewhere on the planet, Dr. [[Leonard McCoy]] and a wounded Spock search for other survivors. Spock explains to McCoy that the tension he witnessed between him and Uhura at ''Yorktown'' was due to his intention to leave [[Starfleet]] to help the Vulcan survivors, and continue the late Ambassador Spock's work. Jaylah, a scavenger who previously escaped Krall's encampment where her father was killed, rescues Scott and takes him to her makeshift home, the grounded {{USS|Franklin|NX-326|6}}, an early Starfleet vessel reported missing over a century earlier. Scott is reunited with Kirk, Chekov, McCoy and Spock. Krall coerces the ''Enterprise'' crew to hand over the Abronath, then uses it to complete an ancient [[biological agent|bioweapon]]. With the device complete, Krall intends to kill ''Yorktown''{{'}}s inhabitants, then use the base to attack the [[United Federation of Planets]]. Kirk and the others free the crew as Krall launches into space with the bioweapon, leading his drones to ''Yorktown''.\n\nThe ''Enterprise'' survivors power up the ''Franklin'' and launch her in pursuit of Krall. Theorizing the swarm's system may be vulnerable to high frequencies such as [[Very high frequency|VHF]] or [[radio]], they jam and destroy the swarm by broadcasting the song \"[[Sabotage (song)|Sabotage]]\" by the [[Beastie Boys]]. Krall is chased by the ''Franklin'' through ''Yorktown''. Uhura and Kirk discover from the ''Franklin''{{'}}s logs that Krall is actually Balthazar Edison, ''Franklin's'' former captain. A pre-Federation human soldier, Edison rejected the Federation's principles of unity and cooperation with former enemies like the [[Xindi (Star Trek)|Xindi]] and the [[Romulan (Star Trek)|Romulans]]. When he and his crew were stranded on Altamid by a wormhole, the survivors used the extinct natives' technology to prolong their lives at the cost of the others, and re-purposed the ancient race's dormant drone workers into the swarm. Thinking the Federation had abandoned them, Edison planned to destroy the Federation and resume galactic conflict. Kirk pursues Edison into ''Yorktown''{{'}}s ventilation system, where Edison activates the bioweapon. Before it can spread, Kirk ejects it and Edison into space, where the weapon kills Edison. Using an alien ship they commandeered, Spock and McCoy save Kirk moments before he is also blown into space.\n\nIn the aftermath, Commodore Paris closes the files of Captain Edison and the USS ''Franklin'' crew. Though offered the promotion to vice admiral, Kirk decides to remain in his position as a captain; Spock chooses to remain in Starfleet, and renews his relationship with Uhura. On Kirk's recommendation, Jaylah is accepted into [[Starfleet Academy]]. As the crew celebrates Kirk's birthday, they watch the construction of their new ship, the [[USS Enterprise (NCC-1701-A)|USS ''Enterprise''-A]]\u2014and resume their mission.\n\n==Cast==\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| image1 = Leonard Nimoy by Gage Skidmore.jpg\n| width1 = 173\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = \n| image2 = Anton Yelchin 2011.jpg\n| width2 = 150\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = \n| footer = [[Leonard Nimoy]] (left) died a year before the film's release.

However, it is only that they will approach a surviving close loved one whose spouse or other close relative that they had foretold the death of.

In Welsh folklore, a similar creature is known as the [[cyhyraeth]].<ref>[[Elias Owen (Welsh cleric)|Owen, Elias]] (1887).
