Shown is the [[crown (headgear)|terraced crown]] of the [[Chrysler Building]] lit at dawn.]]\n\nA '''central business district''' ('''CBD''') is the commercial and business center of a city. In larger cities, it is often synonymous with the city's \"financial district\". Geographically, it often coincides with the \"[[city center|city centre]]\" or \"[[downtown]]\", but the two concepts are separate: many cities have a central ''business'' district located away from its commercial or cultural city centre or downtown, or even several CBDs at once. In [[London]], for example, the \"city centre\" is usually regarded as encompassing the historic [[City of London]] and the mediaeval [[City of Westminster]], whereas the [[City of London]] and the transformed [[London Docklands|Docklands]] area are regarded as its two CBDs. In [[New York City]], [[Midtown Manhattan]] is the largest central business district in the city and in the world; yet [[Lower Manhattan]], commonly called ''Downtown Manhattan'', represents the second largest, and second, distinct CBD in New York City and is geographically situated south of Midtown. In [[Chicago]], the [[Chicago Loop]] is the second largest central business district in the United States and is also referred to as the core of the city's downtown. [[Mexico City]] also has a historic city centre, the colonial-era [[Historic center of Mexico City|Centro Hist\u00f3rico]], along with two CBDs: the mid-late 20th century [[Paseo de la Reforma]] \u2013 [[Polanco (Mexico)|Polanco]], and the new [[Santa Fe (Mexico City)|Santa Fe]].\n\nThe shape and type of a CBD almost always closely reflect the city's history. Cities with strong [[Historic preservation|preservation]] laws and maximum building height restrictions to retain the character of the historic and cultural core will have a CBD quite a distance from the centre of the city. This is quite common for European cities such as [[Paris]] or [[Vienna]]. In cities in the [[New World]] that grew quickly after the invention of mechanised modes such as [[Road transport|road]] or [[Rail transport|rail]] transport, a single central area or downtown will often contain most of the region's tallest buildings and act both as the CBD and the commercial and cultural city center. Increasing [[urbanization|urbanisation]] in the 21st century have developed [[Megacity|megacities]], particularly in [[Asia]], that will often have multiple CBDs scattered across the urban area. It has been said that downtowns (as understood in North America) are therefore conceptually distinct from both CBDs and city centers.<ref>\"[http://www.economist.com/world/na/displaystory.cfm?story_id=E1_RSRQGRD Reviving American downtowns]\".

It is located within [[Gaborone]].\n\n== Canada==\n[[File:Toronto Financial District August 2017.jpg|thumb|Skyscrapers in [[downtown Toronto]], Canada]]\nIn Canada, central business districts are referred to as \"downtown\" or the \"downtown core\" and are mostly highlighted by skyscrapers. In [[Quebec]] and the rest of [[French Canada]], they are known as {{lang|fr|centre-ville}}. [[Toronto]] has [[Downtown Toronto]] (the largest in Canada), which includes the [[Financial District, Toronto|Financial District]] of Canada, major sporting and entertainment venues, educational institutions and multiple corporate headquarters. Additional central business districts in Toronto's divisions [[Etobicoke]], [[North York]], and [[Scarborough, Toronto|Scarborough]] serve their respective populations as local commercial areas. [[Midtown Toronto]] is another secondary central business district that rapidly developed during the 20th century from initially being a suburb. Toronto's surrounding suburban cities of [[Mississauga]], [[Vaughan]] and [[Markham, Ontario|Markham]] contain developed or developing central business districts.\n\nOther major Canadian cities, including [[Montreal]], [[Vancouver]], [[Calgary]], [[Edmonton]], and [[Winnipeg]] also contain downtown districts with skyscrapers above 200 metres in height. Cities, such as [[Quebec City]], [[Halifax, Nova Scotia|Halifax]], and [[Ottawa]], mostly contain downtowns with cultural and heritage landmarks which restrict the heights of developments.\n\n== Mainland China ==\n[[File:Lujiazui 2016.jpg|thumb|[[Lujiazui]], [[Shanghai]]]]\n[[File:Guomao Skyline.jpg|thumb|[[Beijing CBD]], [[Beijing]]]]\n\nIn China terms \"city centre\" ([[Chinese language|Chinese]]: \u5e02\u4e2d\u5fc3) are used but a different commercial district outside of the historic core typically called a \"CBD\" (\u4e2d\u592e\u5546\u52a1\u533a) or \"Financial District\" (\u91d1\u878d\u8d38\u6613\u533a) may exist. Large Chinese cities typically have multiple CBDs spread throughout the urban area. Cities traditionally being major cultural centres with many historic structures in the core such as [[Beijing]], [[Suzhou]] or [[Xi'an]] will have the [[Greenfield land|greenfield]] CBDs built adjacent to the urban core, similar to European cities. While other cities such as [[Guangzhou]], [[Shanghai]], [[Chengdu]] and [[Wuhan]] the city centre will typically house a number of CBDs in addition to [[Greenfield land|greenfield]] CBDs built in the periphery.\n\n== France ==\nIn [[France]], the term \"quartier d\u2019affaires\" may be used to describe the central business district. The main business districts in the country are as follows:\n\n* [[La D\u00e9fense]] in [[Paris]], which with 3,300,000 square meters of office space is Europe's leading business district in terms of area.\n* [[La Part-Dieu]] in [[Lyon]], is the 2nd largest business district in France and has nearly 1,600,000 square metres.\n* [[Euralille]] in [[Lille]], is the 3rd business district of France with 1,120,000 square metres of offices.\n* [[Eurom\u00e9diterran\u00e9e]] in [[Marseille]], is the 4th business district in France with 650,000 square metres of offices.\n\n== Germany ==\n[[File:Frankfurt Am Main-Stadtansicht von der Deutschherrnbruecke zu Beginn der Abenddaemmerung.jpg|thumb|Central business district of [[Frankfurt]], [[Germany]]]]\nIn [[Germany]], the terms ''Innenstadt'' and ''Stadtzentrum'' may be used to describe the central business district. Both terms can be literally translated to mean \"[[inner city]]\" and \"city centre\". Some of the [[metropolitan regions in Germany|larger cities]] have more than one central business district, like [[Berlin]], which has three.\n\nDue to Berlin's history of division during the [[Cold War]], the city contains central business districts both in West ([[Kurf\u00fcrstendamm]]) and East Berlin ([[Alexanderplatz]]), as well as a newly built business centre near [[Potsdamer Platz]]. The city's historic centre \u2013 the location of the [[Reichstag building]], as well as the [[Brandenburg gate]] and most federal ministries \u2013 was largely abandoned when the [[Berlin Wall]] cut through the area. Only after the reunification with the redevelopment of [[Potsdamer Platz]], and the construction of numerous shopping centers, government ministries, embassies, office buildings and entertainment venues, was the area revived.\n\nIn [[Frankfurt|Frankfurt am Main]], there is a business district which is in the geographical centre of the city and it is called the [[Bankenviertel]].\n\n<br />\n[[File:Frankfurt Central Business District.jpg|alt=Central Business District of Frankfurt am Main|border|center|thumb|316x316px|The Central Business District in the German City of [[Frankfurt|Frankfurt am Main]]]]\n[[File:Hong Kong Central District Night View 201305.jpg|thumb|[[Central, Hong Kong|Central]] has been the political and financial centre of [[Victoria, Hong Kong|Victoria]].]]\n\nIn [[D\u00fcsseldorf]], there is a business district which is located around the famous High-Street [[K\u00f6nigsallee]] with banks, shops and offices.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rp-online.de/nrw/staedte/duesseldorf/mischung-macht-das-zentrum-einzigartig-aid-1.4753856 |title=D\u00fcsseldorfs Central Business District: Mischung macht das Zentrum einzigartig |author=Thorsten Breitkopf |work=RP ONLINE |accessdate=2015-12-13}}</ref>\n\n== Hong Kong ==\n[[File:Kwun Tong Dusk View 201407.jpg|thumb|Kwun Tong-Kowloon Bay CBD of [[Kowloon East (constituency)|East Kowloon]]]]\n[[File:Hong Kong International Commerce Centre (15512862984).jpg|thumb|[[West Kowloon]] CBD]]\nIn [[Hong Kong]], [[Central, Hong Kong|Central]], [[Sheung Wan]], [[Wan Chai|Wanchai]] and [[Causeway Bay]] are considered as the central business districts of [[Victoria, Hong Kong|Victoria City]]. The [[Yau Tsim Mong District]] has generally been considered the city centre of [[Kowloon]] before another core emerged in [[Cheung Sha Wan]].\n\nAs part of the [[Airport Core Programme]], the [[Union Square (Hong Kong)|Union Square]] project launched by the MTR Corporation has brought it another CBD in [[West Kowloon]]. With the latest implementation of \"Energising Kowloon East\" Scheme by the Hong Kong Government, [[Kowloon Bay]] and [[Kwun Tong]] Business Area have been gradually redeveloped and transformed into CBDs.\n\nThe CBDs of new towns and satellite cities such as [[Tuen Mun]], [[Sha Tin]] and [[Tung Chung]] have been characterised by sky-scraping residential blocks on top of large shopping centres that provide services to local residents. These mixed use development usually surround the central public transit station of such towns.\n\n== Indonesia ==\nThe largest CBD in Indonesia is known as the [[Golden Triangle of Jakarta|Golden Triangle]] (''Segitiga Emas'' in [[Indonesian language]]) in [[Jakarta]]. The area is located along the main avenues of Jakarta, [[Jalan Jenderal Sudirman]] \u2013 [[Jalan M.H. Thamrin]] -[[Jalan H.R. Rasuna Said]] \u2013 [[Jalan Prof. Dr. Satrio]] \u2013 [[Jalan Jenderal Gatot Subroto]]. [[SCBD|Sudirman Central Business District]], a super block that is located within the Golden Triangle, is the first of its kind in Indonesia, and one of the largest commercial center development in the city. Jakarta started developing the sophistication of its Business District in the early 1960s before to host the [[1962 Asian Games|Asian Games in 1962]].<ref>[http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2015/06/22/sukarno-s-vision-a-modern-capital.html thejakartapost.com]; Sukarno's vision of a modern capital</ref>\n\n[[Surabaya]] in [[East Java]], built its first central business district in the Darmo region.

[[Karachi]] is Pakistan's largest city and the country's economic hub; the [[I. I. Chundrigar Road]] of the city, often called the \"Wall Street of Pakistan,\" acts as Karachi's main financial district and is essentially a center of economic and industrial activity. [[Shahrah-e-Faisal|Shahra-e-Faisal]] in Karachi is also one of the most important business districts of Pakistan.\n\nAnother important business district is [[Gulberg, Lahore]]. It has a large number of important office buildings as well as many high-rises and shopping malls.

[[Ferozepur Road]] is also central business district of [[Lahore]]. It is served by [[Lahore bus rapid transit]]. Kayre International Hotel, and [[Arfa Software Technology Park]] are also present on Ferozepur Road.\n\n[[Jinnah Avenue]] in [[Islamabad]] is the main business district of the city. It is lined with numerous office buildings. [[Blue Area]] is also central business districts of [[Islamabad]].

The [[Paseo de la Castellana]] holds the city's main business districts: the [[Gate of Europe]], [[AZCA]] and [[Cuatro Torres Business Area|CTBA]]. AZCA is 19-hectare super block near [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid's]] stadium [[Santiago Bernab\u00e9u Stadium|Santiago Bernab\u00e9u]]. It used to be the country's main business area during the 1980s and 1990s, when most of its skyscrapers were built. The tallest building of AZCA is the [[Torre Picasso]], a 158-tower designed by the [[World Trade Center (1973\u20132001)|World Trade Center's]] architect, and contains the main offices in Spain of [[Google]] and [[Deloitte]]. The Gate of Europe consists of two twin towers, which hold Spanish bank [[Bankia]] and real state company Realia. Just a few blocks north is the CTBA, a complex of four skyscrapers which are the tallest in Spain. Architects such as [[Norman Foster, Baron Foster of Thames Bank|Norman Foster]], [[Ieoh Ming Pei]] and [[Cesar Pelli]] have designed its towers, which were completed in 2008. The tallest building, the [[Torre de Cristal]], is the fourth tallest building is [[Western Europe]], with a height of 250 metres. The complex is home to offices from well known companies such as [[KPMG]], [[Coca-Cola]], [[Volkswagen]], [[Bankia]], [[Cepsa]], [[Pwc]], [[Obrasc\u00f3n Huarte Lain|OHL]] and holds the embassies of the [[Netherlands]], [[United Kingdom]], Canada and [[Australia]], as well as a 5-star hotel from [[Eurostars Hotels|Eurostars]].

There are many central business districts located on the island of [[Taiwan]]. In [[Taipei]], the capital city of [[Taiwan]] ([[Republic of China]]), the area around its [[Taipei Station|main railway station]] or [[Zhongzheng District]] is regarded as the historic city centre whilst the [[Xinyi District]](especially [[Xinyi Special District]]) or [[Eastern District of Taipei]] located to the east of the said railway station is the current CBD of Taipei, being both the modern financial, political and economic district and the premier shopping area, including the location of [[Taipei 101]], Taiwan's tallest building, rising {{convert|509.2|m|ft|0}}.\n\nIn the southern [[Taiwan]]ese city of [[Kaohsiung]], the main CBDs are [[Cianjin District]] and [[Lingya District]]; and in the central Taiwanese metropolitan area of [[Taichung]], the CBD is [[Xitun District]], especially [[Taichung's 7th Redevelopment Zone]], in which most high-rise buildings containing offices are concentrated.\n\n== United Kingdom ==\n[[File:2019 London, Canary Wharf 02.jpg|thumb|One of two CBDs in London, [[Canary Wharf]] is slightly to the east of London's centre.]]\n[[File:The city of london 2019.jpg|thumb|[[City of London|The City]] in central London.]]\nThe alternative term ''city centre'' is used in United Kingdom and [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]. In British-influenced countries, such as the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth realms]], former British territories, also use many of the same terms, but also have many characteristics of British cities. In the UK, Australia and South Africa, the term is often just shortened to \"city\", as in \"going to the city\"; it is often also called \"town\" (\"going (in)to town\", \"going up town\", or \"going down town\"). One exception is in [[London]] where \"the City\" specifically refers to the [[City of London]] (one of the two main financial districts), rather than to any other part of [[London]].\n[[File:Birmingham Skyline from Edgbaston Cricket Ground.jpg|thumb|[[Birmingham]] city centre's skyline, as seen from [[Edgbaston Cricket Ground]]]]\n\n== United States ==\n[[File:Lower Manhattan viewed from Brooklyn.jpg|thumb|View of [[Lower Manhattan]] in New York City.

In most cities the downtown area will be home to the financial district, but usually contains entertainment and retail of some kind as well. The downtown areas of many cities, such as [[Los Angeles County, California|Los Angeles]], [[Chicago]], [[Denver]], [[Atlanta]], [[Cleveland, Ohio|Cleveland]], [[San Diego]], [[New Orleans]], [[San Francisco]], [[St. Louis]], and [[Houston]], are also home to large sports and convention venues. Historic sections of a central business district may be called \"old town\", while decaying parts of the centre city are commonly called the \"[[inner city]]\". The term ''inner city'' is sometimes used evocatively, applying a negative connotation and referring to peripheral areas that suffered economically from [[white flight]].\n\nSome cities in the United States, such as [[Minneapolis, Minnesota]], and [[Dallas, Texas]], have [[Mixed-use development|mixed use]] districts known as \"uptown\" in addition to the primary downtown core areas. In some cities, such as [[Cincinnati, Ohio]]; [[Charlotte, North Carolina]]; [[Chicago, Illinois]] and [[Oklahoma City, Oklahoma]], \"uptown\" is instead the historic name for a separate business center or neighbourhood. [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]] and [[Wilmington, Delaware]] use the term ''Center City'' instead of ''downtown'' for their central business districts as well as most of the cities and towns in the northwest states. In other cities, like [[Los Angeles]], [[Indianapolis]], and [[Omaha]], the city core is simply known as \"downtown\".  [[Jacksonville, Florida]] refers to its central business district as the [[Downtown Jacksonville|Urban Core]], a term which is also sometimes applied to its denser surrounding neighborhoods.  In [[New Orleans, Louisiana]], the phrase [[Central Business District, New Orleans|central business district]] is used; and while ''downtown'' is sometimes used synonymously, traditionally it referred to parts of the city downriver from [[Canal Street, New Orleans|Canal Street]], which did not include the CBD.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Business improvement district]]\n* [[Downtown]]\n* [[List of central business districts]]\n* [[Peak land value intersection]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n{{Cities}}\n\n[[Category:Central business districts| ]]\n[[Category:City]]\n[[Category:Neighbourhoods]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Commercial and business centre of a city}}\n{{redirect|Central Business District|the historic city center in Miami|Central Business District (Miami)|other districts|List of central business districts}}\n{{Multiple issues|\n {{original research|date=September 2015}}\n {{more citations needed|date=September 2015}}\n {{Globalize|date=December 2013}}\n}}\n\n{{Use dmy dates|date=July 2013}}\n\n[[File:ChryslerBuildingMidtownManhattanNewYorkCity.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|[[Midtown Manhattan]] in [[New York City]], the largest central business district in the world. Shown is the [[crown (headgear)|terraced crown]] of the [[Chrysler Building]] lit at dawn.]]\n\nA '''central business district''' ('''CBD''') is the commercial and business center of a city. In larger cities, it is often synonymous with the city's \"financial district\". Geographically, it often coincides with the \"[[city center|city centre]]\" or \"[[downtown]]\", but the two concepts are separate: many cities have a central ''business'' district located away from its commercial or cultural city centre or downtown, or even several CBDs at once. In [[London]], for example, the \"city centre\" is usually regarded as encompassing the historic [[City of London]] and the mediaeval [[City of Westminster]], whereas the [[City of London]] and the transformed [[London Docklands|Docklands]] area are regarded as its two CBDs. In [[New York City]], [[Midtown Manhattan]] is the largest central business district in the city and in the world; yet [[Lower Manhattan]], commonly called ''Downtown Manhattan'', represents the second largest, and second, distinct CBD in New York City and is geographically situated south of Midtown. In [[Chicago]], the [[Chicago Loop]] is the second largest central business district in the United States and is also referred to as the core of the city's downtown. [[Mexico City]] also has a historic city centre, the colonial-era [[Historic center of Mexico City|Centro Hist\u00f3rico]], along with two CBDs: the mid-late 20th century [[Paseo de la Reforma]] \u2013 [[Polanco (Mexico)|Polanco]], and the new [[Santa Fe (Mexico City)|Santa Fe]].\n\nThe shape and type of a CBD almost always closely reflect the city's history. Cities with strong [[Historic preservation|preservation]] laws and maximum building height restrictions to retain the character of the historic and cultural core will have a CBD quite a distance from the centre of the city. This is quite common for European cities such as [[Paris]] or [[Vienna]]. In cities in the [[New World]] that grew quickly after the invention of mechanised modes such as [[Road transport|road]] or [[Rail transport|rail]] transport, a single central area or downtown will often contain most of the region's tallest buildings and act both as the CBD and the commercial and cultural city center. Increasing [[urbanization|urbanisation]] in the 21st century have developed [[Megacity|megacities]], particularly in [[Asia]], that will often have multiple CBDs scattered across the urban area. It has been said that downtowns (as understood in North America) are therefore conceptually distinct from both CBDs and city centers.<ref>\"[http://www.economist.com/world/na/displaystory.cfm?story_id=E1_RSRQGRD Reviving American downtowns]\".

In [[Quebec]] and the rest of [[French Canada]], they are known as {{lang|fr|centre-ville}}. [[Toronto]] has [[Downtown Toronto]] (the largest in Canada), which includes the [[Financial District, Toronto|Financial District]] of Canada, major sporting and entertainment venues, educational institutions and multiple corporate headquarters. Additional central business districts in Toronto's divisions [[Etobicoke]], [[North York]], and [[Scarborough, Toronto|Scarborough]] serve their respective populations as local commercial areas. [[Midtown Toronto]] is another secondary central business district that rapidly developed during the 20th century from initially being a suburb. Toronto's surrounding suburban cities of [[Mississauga]], [[Vaughan]] and [[Markham, Ontario|Markham]] contain developed or developing central business districts.\n\nOther major Canadian cities, including [[Montreal]], [[Vancouver]], [[Calgary]], [[Edmonton]], and [[Winnipeg]] also contain downtown districts with skyscrapers above 200 metres in height. Cities, such as [[Quebec City]], [[Halifax, Nova Scotia|Halifax]], and [[Ottawa]], mostly contain downtowns with cultural and heritage landmarks which restrict the heights of developments.\n\n== Mainland China ==\n[[File:Lujiazui 2016.jpg|thumb|[[Lujiazui]], [[Shanghai]].]]\n[[File:Guomao Skyline.jpg|thumb|[[Beijing CBD]], [[Beijing]].]]\n\nIn China terms \"city centre\" ([[Chinese language|Chinese]]: \u5e02\u4e2d\u5fc3) are used but a different commercial district outside of the historic core typically called a \"CBD\" (\u4e2d\u592e\u5546\u52a1\u533a) or \"Financial District\" (\u91d1\u878d\u8d38\u6613\u533a) may exist. Large Chinese cities typically have multiple CBDs spread throughout the urban area. Cities traditionally being major cultural centres with many historic structures in the core such as [[Beijing]], [[Suzhou]] or [[Xi'an]] will have the [[Greenfield land|greenfield]] CBDs built adjacent to the urban core, similar to European cities. While other cities such as [[Guangzhou]], [[Shanghai]], [[Chengdu]] and [[Wuhan]] the city centre will typically house a number of CBDs in addition to [[Greenfield land|greenfield]] CBDs built in the periphery.\n\n== France ==\nIn [[France]], the term \"quartier d\u2019affaires\" may be used to describe the central business district. The main business districts in the country are as follows:\n\n* [[La D\u00e9fense]] in [[Paris]], which with 3,300,000 square meters of office space is Europe's leading business district in terms of area.\n* [[La Part-Dieu]] in [[Lyon]], is the 2nd largest business district in France and has nearly 1,600,000 square metres.\n* [[Euralille]] in [[Lille]], is the 3rd business district of France with 1,120,000 square metres of offices.\n* [[Eurom\u00e9diterran\u00e9e]] in [[Marseille]], is the 4th business district in France with 650,000 square metres of offices.\n\n== Germany ==\n[[File:Frankfurt Am Main-Stadtansicht von der Deutschherrnbruecke zu Beginn der Abenddaemmerung.jpg|thumb|Central business district of [[Frankfurt]], [[Germany]].]]\nIn [[Germany]], the terms ''Innenstadt'' and ''Stadtzentrum'' may be used to describe the central business district. Both terms can be literally translated to mean \"[[inner city]]\" and \"city centre\". Some of the [[metropolitan regions in Germany|larger cities]] have more than one central business district, like [[Berlin]], which has three.\n\nDue to Berlin's history of division during the [[Cold War]], the city contains central business districts both in West ([[Kurf\u00fcrstendamm]]) and East Berlin ([[Alexanderplatz]]), as well as a newly built business centre near [[Potsdamer Platz]]. The city's historic centre \u2013 the location of the [[Reichstag building]], as well as the [[Brandenburg gate]] and most federal ministries \u2013 was largely abandoned when the [[Berlin Wall]] cut through the area. Only after the reunification with the redevelopment of [[Potsdamer Platz]], and the construction of numerous shopping centers, government ministries, embassies, office buildings and entertainment venues, was the area revived.\n\nIn [[Frankfurt|Frankfurt am Main]], there is a business district which is in the geographical centre of the city and it is called the [[Bankenviertel]].\n\n<br />\n[[File:Frankfurt Central Business District.jpg|alt=Central Business District of Frankfurt am Main|border|center|thumb|316x316px|The Central Business District in the German City of [[Frankfurt|Frankfurt am Main]]]]\n[[File:Hong Kong Central District Night View 201305.jpg|thumb|[[Central, Hong Kong|Central]] has been the political and financial centre of [[Victoria, Hong Kong|Victoria]]]]\n\nIn [[D\u00fcsseldorf]], there is a business district which is located around the famous High-Street [[K\u00f6nigsallee]] with banks, shops and offices.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rp-online.de/nrw/staedte/duesseldorf/mischung-macht-das-zentrum-einzigartig-aid-1.4753856 |title=D\u00fcsseldorfs Central Business District: Mischung macht das Zentrum einzigartig |author=Thorsten Breitkopf |work=RP ONLINE |accessdate=2015-12-13}}</ref>\n\n== Hong Kong ==\n[[File:Kwun Tong Dusk View 201407.jpg|thumb|Kwun Tong-Kowloon Bay CBD of [[Kowloon East (constituency)|East Kowloon]]]]\n[[File:Hong Kong International Commerce Centre (15512862984).jpg|thumb|[[West Kowloon]] CBD]]\nIn [[Hong Kong]], [[Central, Hong Kong|Central]], [[Sheung Wan]], [[Wan Chai|Wanchai]] and [[Causeway Bay]] are considered as the central business districts of [[Victoria, Hong Kong|Victoria City]]. The [[Yau Tsim Mong District]] has generally been considered the city centre of [[Kowloon]] before another core emerged in [[Cheung Sha Wan]].\n\nAs part of the [[Airport Core Programme]], the [[Union Square (Hong Kong)|Union Square]] project launched by the MTR Corporation has brought it another CBD in [[West Kowloon]]. With the latest implementation of \"Energising Kowloon East\" Scheme by the Hong Kong Government, [[Kowloon Bay]] and [[Kwun Tong]] Business Area have been gradually redeveloped and transformed into CBDs.\n\nThe CBDs of new towns and satellite cities such as [[Tuen Mun]], [[Sha Tin]] and [[Tung Chung]] have been characterised by sky-scraping residential blocks on top of large shopping centres that provide services to local residents. These mixed use development usually surround the central public transit station of such towns.\n\n== Indonesia ==\nThe largest CBD in Indonesia is known as the [[Golden Triangle of Jakarta|Golden Triangle]] (''Segitiga Emas'' in [[Indonesian language]]) in [[Jakarta]]. The area is located along the main avenues of Jakarta, [[Jalan Jenderal Sudirman]] \u2013 [[Jalan M.H. Thamrin]] -[[Jalan H.R.

[[Shahrah-e-Faisal|Shahra-e-Faisal]] in Karachi is also one of the most important business districts of Pakistan.\n\nAnother important business district is [[Gulberg, Lahore]]. It has a large number of important office buildings as well as many high-rises and shopping malls.

The [[Paseo de la Castellana]] holds the city's main business districts: the [[Gate of Europe]], [[AZCA]] and [[Cuatro Torres Business Area|CTBA]]. AZCA is 19-hectare super block near [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid's]] stadium [[Santiago Bernab\u00e9u Stadium|Santiago Bernab\u00e9u]]. It used to be the country's main business area during the 1980s and 1990s, when most of its skyscrapers were built.

The Gate of Europe consists of two twin towers, which hold Spanish bank [[Bankia]] and real state company Realia. Just a few blocks north is the CTBA, a complex of four skyscrapers which are the tallest in Spain. Architects such as [[Norman Foster, Baron Foster of Thames Bank|Norman Foster]], [[Ieoh Ming Pei]] and [[Cesar Pelli]] have designed its towers, which were completed in 2008. The tallest building, the [[Torre de Cristal]], is the fourth tallest building is [[Western Europe]], with a height of 250 metres. The complex is home to offices from well known companies such as [[KPMG]], [[Coca-Cola]], [[Volkswagen]], [[Bankia]], [[Cepsa]], [[Pwc]], [[Obrasc\u00f3n Huarte Lain|OHL]] and holds the embassies of the [[Netherlands]], [[United Kingdom]], Canada and [[Australia]], as well as a 5-star hotel from [[Eurostars Hotels|Eurostars]].

One exception is in [[London]] where \"the City\" specifically refers to the [[City of London]] (one of the two main financial districts), rather than to any other part of [[London]].\n[[File:Birmingham Skyline from Edgbaston Cricket Ground.jpg|thumb|[[Birmingham]] city centre's skyline, as seen from [[Edgbaston Cricket Ground]].]]\n\n== United States ==\n[[File:Lower Manhattan viewed from Brooklyn.jpg|thumb|View of [[Lower Manhattan]] in New York City. [[One World Trade Center]] is the tallest [[skyscraper]] in the Western Hemisphere.]]\n\nIn the United States, central business districts are often called \"downtown\" (even if there is no \"uptown\"). In most cities the downtown area will be home to the financial district, but usually contains entertainment and retail of some kind as well. The downtown areas of many cities, such as [[Los Angeles County, California|Los Angeles]], [[Chicago]], [[Denver]], [[Atlanta]], [[Cleveland, Ohio|Cleveland]], [[San Diego]], [[New Orleans]], [[San Francisco]], [[St. Louis]], and [[Houston]], are also home to large sports and convention venues. Historic sections of a central business district may be called \"old town\", while decaying parts of the centre city are commonly called the \"[[inner city]]\". The term ''inner city'' is sometimes used evocatively, applying a negative connotation and referring to peripheral areas that suffered economically from [[white flight]].\n\nSome cities in the United States, such as [[Minneapolis, Minnesota]], and [[Dallas, Texas]], have [[Mixed-use development|mixed use]] districts known as \"uptown\" in addition to the primary downtown core areas. In some cities, such as [[Cincinnati, Ohio]]; [[Charlotte, North Carolina]]; [[Chicago, Illinois]] and [[Oklahoma City, Oklahoma]], \"uptown\" is instead the historic name for a separate business center or neighbourhood. [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]] and [[Wilmington, Delaware]] use the term ''Center City'' instead of ''downtown'' for their central business districts as well as most of the cities and towns in the northwest states. In other cities, like [[Los Angeles]], [[Indianapolis]], and [[Omaha]], the city core is simply known as \"downtown\".  [[Jacksonville, Florida]] refers to its central business district as the [[Downtown Jacksonville|Urban Core]], a term which is also sometimes applied to its denser surrounding neighborhoods.  In [[New Orleans, Louisiana]], the phrase [[Central Business District, New Orleans|central business district]] is used; and while ''downtown'' is sometimes used synonymously, traditionally it referred to parts of the city downriver from [[Canal Street, New Orleans|Canal Street]], which did not include the CBD.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Business improvement district]]\n* [[Downtown]]\n* [[List of central business districts]]\n* [[Peak land value intersection]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n{{Cities}}\n\n[[Category:Central business districts| ]]\n[[Category:City]]\n[[Category:Neighbourhoods]]\n", "name_user": "1980fast", "label": "safe", "comment": "Caption punctuation adjustment, per WP:CAPFRAG", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_business_district"}

Lee]] (professor of religion and Asian studies at Calvin University) of Gertoux's work is present: \n{{quote|In contrast to the long-held Jewish tradition, the author claims that the name of God in the HB should be pronounced. His claim is based on Exod 9:16, \"... to make my name resound through all the earth\" and Maimonides' work stressing the impossibility of a deep, personal relationship with a nameless God. With a survey of the historical record from \"Adam\" to the American Standard Version, Gertoux argues that the letters Y, W, H are read as the vowels I (or E), U (or O), and A. For the H, a mute e could be added in order to be better heard. The tetragrammaton, YHWH, is therefore read I-eH-U-A (Iehoua), the equivalent of YeHoWaH in Masoretic punctuation. This means that the name is to be pronounced as it is written, or according to its letters. The result is that the tetragrammaton is the only Hebrew name constituted, not of four consonants, but of four vowels, as noted by Josephus. This detailed treatment of the Name is useful for those who are interested in the history of its translation over the centuries.{{sfn|Lee|2003|pp=285}}}} \n\nDidier M. Fontaine reports that G. Gertoux \"shows how frequent the use of the Name has been, from the earliest times to around c.150, when the Jews began, both orally and in writing, to show serious reservations about the use of the divine name, especially with non-Jews.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://areopage.net/blog/2015/04/07/le-nom-divin-imprononcable-gertoux-2015/|author=Didier Micka\u00ebl Fontaine|title=Le nom divin: impronon\u00e7able?

J. Wilkinson states: \"the book is intended to be a work of history, and I have thus eschewed theological comment as inappropriate. I am unaware of any previous work with the scope of this book, unless it be found among those who wish to promote (or prohibit) a devotional or liturgical use of the Tetragrammaton or hold strong views about its pronunciation and meaning\", and at the footnote of the page he points out that he considers that in the French version of G. Gertoux's book a chronological account of the tetragrammaton is offered, but \"he is primarily interested in supporting his assertion that the Tetragrammaton has always been read \"according to his letters,\" i.e. ''yhwh'' treated as ''[[matres lectionis]]'' and vocalized \"Jehovah\".\" R. J. Wilkinson adds G. Gertoux believes that \"the eclipse of the name was part of a satanic strategy and he believes that the Tetragrammaton appeared in the first New Testament texts.\"{{sfn|Wilkinson|2015|pp=38}}\n\nAnne Pasquier (Faculty of Theology and Religious Studies at Laval University) based on the book by G. Gertoux states that \"the perfume is associated with the divine name\", \"theme of good smell is linked to the name in the Bible\", and concludes that in [[Song of Songs]] 1,3: \"there is indeed a play on words in Hebrew between the expression \"your name\" (shem\u00e9ka) and \"your scented oils\" (sheman\u00e9ka), the name of God being comparable to an incense.\"{{sfn|Pasquier|2011|pp=126}}\n\n[[Fran\u00e7ois B\u0153spflug]] (professor emeritus of history of religions at the Faculty of Catholic Theology in Strasbourg ) wrote that G.

Ross, (professor at the Biblical Institute of the Baptist Church in Mukwonago (Wisconsin)), agrees with G. Gertoux, who states that the Masoretic points must indicate the correct pronunciation, because it is inconceivable that God allows lose the correct pronunciation of his name, and that, despite the grammatical processes of mutation of the vowels when they are far from the accent (as ''d\u0101b\u0101r'' to the plural is made ''d\u0259b\u0101r\u012bm''). T. D. Ross considers significant, like Gertoux, that the theophoric names do not contain the vowels of Yahweh but those of [[Jehovah]].<ref>{{cite document|author=Thomas D. Ross|title=Trinitarianism Syllabus|citeseerx=10.1.1.694.8315}}</ref> T. D. Ross also considers the work of G.

Gertoux on the idea that he \"postulated that the perpetual qere was not for Adonai, but for Shema\", and considers that some have recently pointed out \"a number of problems with [[Wilhelm Gesenius|Gesenius]]'s theory.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Origins of Adonai in the Hebrew Scriptures|author=Ren Manetti|url=https://www.academia.edu/4428591}}</ref>\n\nDaniel Faivre calls Yahweh the most frequent vocalization, \"but considers that it is not formally consolidated\" and therefore prefers to \"use the tetragrammaton in its consonant integrity\" and then quotes the work of G. Gertoux in its French version as \"a more complete study.\"{{sfn|Faivre|2007|pp=13}}\n\nIn observations of [[4Q120]] and some Hebrew words among some scrolls, [[George Wesley Buchanan]] (Professor Emeritus at Wesley Theological Seminary) claim that \"for many years scholars have mistakenly assumed that the Tetragrammaton was to be correctly pronounced ''Y\u00e1h-weh'', treating the central vowel as if it were a consonant. This error has recently been corrected.\"{{sfn|Buchanan|2005|pp=11}} G. W. Buchanan thinks that there are arguments for the pronounciation Yahowah, but agrees with G. Gertoux in that \"based on this data, the divine name will be spelled arbitrarily ''Yehowah''.{{sfn|Buchanan|2005|pp=12}}\n\n==== New Testament ====\n{{main|Names and titles of God in the New Testament}}\nD.

Gilligan states: \"because God is wondrous and mighty\u2014an object of awe\u2014the name of God would also be wondrous and mighty, intended to be spoken or sung with reverence. In a biblical culture, the name of God would express God\u2019s majesty and power\" and adds: \"to put it in other terms, a biblical name (in a sense) was an alter ego; it represented the person. To know someone\u2019s name was to know who and what the person was: not only his or her character or qualities, but especially his or her power, role, or function\u2014what the individual was empowered to do.

Vasileiadis (Post-Doc Researcher at Aristotle University of Thessaloniki) reports that \"according to G. Gertoux, the Greek term ''\u0399\u03b1\u03c9'' comes from the Hebrew ''[[Yahu]]'', and the Samaritan term ''\u0399\u03b1\u03b2\u03b5'' comes from the Aramaic ''Yaw''.\"{{sfn|Vasileiadis|2013|pp=13}} G.

Lee]] (professor of religion and Asian studies at Calvin University) of Gertoux's work is present: \n{{quote|In contrast to the long-held Jewish tradition, the author claims that the name of God in the HB should be pronounced. His claim is based on Exod 9:16, \"... to make my name resound through all the earth\" and Maimonides' work stressing the impossibility of a deep, personal relationship with a nameless God. With a survey of the historical record from \"Adam\" to the American Standard Version, Gertoux argues that the letters Y, W, H are read as the vowels I (or E), U (or O), and A. For the H, a mute e could be added in order to be better heard. The tetragrammaton, YHWH, is therefore read I-eH-U-A (Iehoua), the equivalent of YeHoWaH in Masoretic punctuation. This means that the name is to be pronounced as it is written, or according to its letters. The result is that the tetragrammaton is the only Hebrew name constituted, not of four consonants, but of four vowels, as noted by Josephus. This detailed treatment of the Name is useful for those who are interested in the history of its translation over the centuries.{{sfn|Lee|2003|pp=285}}}} \n\nDidier M. Fontaine reports that G. Gertoux \"shows how frequent the use of the Name has been, from the earliest times to around c.150, when the Jews began, both orally and in writing, to show serious reservations about the use of the divine name, especially with non-Jews.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://areopage.net/blog/2015/04/07/le-nom-divin-imprononcable-gertoux-2015/|author=Didier Micka\u00ebl Fontaine|title=Le nom divin: impronon\u00e7able?

J. Wilkinson states: \"the book is intended to be a work of history, and I have thus eschewed theological comment as inappropriate. I am unaware of any previous work with the scope of this book, unless it be found among those who wish to promote (or prohibit) a devotional or liturgical use of the Tetragrammaton or hold strong views about its pronunciation and meaning\", and at the footnote of the page he points out that he considers that in the French version of G. Gertoux's book a chronological account of the tetragrammaton is offered, but \"he is primarily interested in supporting his assertion that the Tetragrammaton has always been read \"according to his letters,\" i.e. ''yhwh'' treated as ''[[matres lectionis]]'' and vocalized \"Jehovah\".\" R. J. Wilkinson adds G. Gertoux believes that \"the eclipse of the name was part of a satanic strategy and he believes that the Tetragrammaton appeared in the first New Testament texts.\"{{sfn|Wilkinson|2015|pp=38}}\n\nAnne Pasquier (Faculty of Theology and Religious Studies at Laval University) based on the book by G. Gertoux states that \"the perfume is associated with the divine name\", \"theme of good smell is linked to the name in the Bible\", and concludes that in [[Song of Songs]] 1,3: \"there is indeed a play on words in Hebrew between the expression \"your name\" (shem\u00e9ka) and \"your scented oils\" (sheman\u00e9ka), the name of God being comparable to an incense.\"{{sfn|Pasquier|2011|pp=126}}\n\n[[Fran\u00e7ois B\u0153spflug]] (professor emeritus of history of religions at the Faculty of Catholic Theology in Strasbourg ) wrote that G.

Gertoux, [[Charles Perrot]], (emeritus professor of [[Institut Catholique de Paris]]) said him in a letter that \"remarks on the pronunciation of YHWH seem very relevant to me, even if, currently, it is in practice a little difficult to \"back off\" , without giving the impression of giving in to Jehovah's Witnesses.\"<ref name = CAPLC/>\n\nThomas D. Ross, (professor at the Biblical Institute of the Baptist Church in Mukwonago (Wisconsin)), agrees with G. Gertoux, who states that the Masoretic points must indicate the correct pronunciation, because it is inconceivable that God allows lose the correct pronunciation of his name, and that, despite the grammatical processes of mutation of the vowels when they are far from the accent (as ''d\u0101b\u0101r'' to the plural is made ''d\u0259b\u0101r\u012bm''). T. D. Ross considers significant, like Gertoux, that the theophoric names do not contain the vowels of Yahweh but those of [[Jehovah]].<ref>{{cite document|author=Thomas D. Ross|title=Trinitarianism Syllabus|citeseerx=10.1.1.694.8315}}</ref> T. D. Ross also considers the work of G.

Gertoux on the idea that he \"postulated that the perpetual qere was not for Adonai, but for Shema\", and considers that some have recently pointed out \"a number of problems with [[Wilhelm Gesenius|Gesenius]]'s theory.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Origins of Adonai in the Hebrew Scriptures|author=Ren Manetti|url=https://www.academia.edu/4428591}}</ref>\n\nDaniel Faivre calls Yahweh the most frequent vocalization, \"but considers that it is not formally consolidated\" and therefore prefers to \"use the tetragrammaton in its consonant integrity\" and then quotes the work of G. Gertoux in its French version as \"a more complete study.\"{{sfn|Faivre|2007|pp=13}}\n\nIn observations of [[4Q120]] and some Hebrew words among some scrolls, [[George Wesley Buchanan]] (Professor Emeritus at Wesley Theological Seminary) claim that \"for many years scholars have mistakenly assumed that the Tetragrammaton was to be correctly pronounced ''Y\u00e1h-weh'', treating the central vowel as if it were a consonant. This error has recently been corrected.\"{{sfn|Buchanan|2005|pp=11}} G. W. Buchanan thinks that there are arguments for the pronounciation Yahowah, but agrees with G. Gertoux in that \"based on this data, the divine name will be spelled arbitrarily ''Yehowah''.{{sfn|Buchanan|2005|pp=12}}\n\n==== New Testament ====\n{{main|Names and titles of God in the New Testament}}\nD. Fontaine and R. J. Wilkinson affirm that G.

Gilligan states: \"because God is wondrous and mighty\u2014an object of awe\u2014the name of God would also be wondrous and mighty, intended to be spoken or sung with reverence. In a biblical culture, the name of God would express God\u2019s majesty and power\" and adds: \"to put it in other terms, a biblical name (in a sense) was an alter ego; it represented the person. To know someone\u2019s name was to know who and what the person was: not only his or her character or qualities, but especially his or her power, role, or function\u2014what the individual was empowered to do.

YouTube|via=YouTube |accessdate=22 February 2017}}</ref> This series aims to put the spotlight on lesser known YouTube animators or movie related channels. It is also used to bridge the gap between HISHE's own videos.\n\nThe series has been a success, both in terms of views and features, which include Ricepirate, OnlyLeigh, BrotherhoodWorkshop as well as Hank and Jed. The series has however received some criticism from fans who believe the content is not up to par with HISHE's own and could therefore damage their reputation. HISHE has responded by refuting these claims stating that it is beneficial to all parties involved.\n\n=== HISHE Kids ===\nHISHE launched an additional channel called HISHE Kids, with the show ''Fixed Fairy Tales''.\n\n== Super Cafe / Villain's Pub ==\nThe ''Super Cafe / Villain's Pub'' is a segment that debuted at the end of ''How Superman Should Have Ended'' which featured [[Superman]] discussing the alternate events of the 1978 ''[[Superman (1978 film)|Superman]]'' film in a cafe with [[Batman]], which began the trend of the ''Super Cafe''. Though it is thought to be based on ''[[Seinfeld]]'', the clips are actually based on the final scene of Daniel Baxter's favorite film, ''[[Swingers (1996 film)|Swingers]]'', with Superman standing in for Trent and Batman standing in for Mike.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=56sEJKjD95M|title=Super Cafe: Swingers Tribute|first=|last=How It Should Have Ended|date=11 April 2013|publisher=|accessdate=22 February 2017|via=YouTube}}</ref>\n\nIn various superhero episodes of ''How it Should have Ended'', altered or added scenes are shown from the superhero film, followed by the superheroes that appear in the movie interacting with Batman and Superman (both voiced by Daniel Baxter) in the Super Cafe; it also always appears at the end of each episode. The Super Cafe segment is featured in every superhero film the series has covered so far. Superman and Batman also make a brief appearance in a cafe in the ''How [[Pulp Fiction]] Should Have Ended''. The segment was also used in the [[Nostalgia Critic]]'s review of ''Man of Steel''.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://thatguywiththeglasses.com/videolinks/thatguywiththeglasses/nostalgia-critic/41449-man-of-steel|title= Man of Steel|date= November 2, 2013|website= That Guy With the Glasses|publisher= [[Nostalgia Critic]]|accessdate= December 22, 2013}}</ref> A companion segment called the \"Villain Pub\" which is modeled from [[Cheers]] and features many popular villains like [[Loki (comics)|Loki]], [[Joker (comics)|the Joker]], [[Lord Voldemort|Voldemort]] and many more began with ''How [[Thor: The Dark World]] Should Have Ended''. In those segments, [[Emperor Palpatine]] is the bartender and [[Bowser (character)|Bowser]] is the bouncer (bownser). The [[Where Everybody Knows Your Name|Cheers Theme Song]] was rewritten as a theme.\n\nThere are numerous running gags in the Super Cafe segments, the most notable being in which Batman always explains his various accomplishments and abilities or finds some kind of excuse to say his catchphrase ''\"Because I'm Batman!\"'', much to Superman's irritation. In the ''Suicide Squad'' HISHE, Batman discovers the Villain Pub and in the Villain Pub episode \"Boss Battle\", goes to confront the villains congregating there, nearly successfully, only to be tempted by Emperor Palpatine by his weakness \u2013 the ladies. It is then that Harley Quinn, who had used her vexing charms to be allowed back into the pub, knocks out Batman from behind. Batman is then taken into the cellar to be fed to the shark Jaws, who is comically depicted as talking in a high-pitched voice, chained up and stripped of his equipment. He barely escapes after being rescued by Dr. Strange, a fact that is reiterated in the ''Doctor Strange'' HISHE (which also cryptically contained a spoiler for the ''Avengers: Infinity War'' trailer). Later, in the ''Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2'' HISHE, things begin to take a turn for the dire when Ayesha, disgusted by heroes congregating in a cafe to meet, decides to punish superheroes whom she blames for her failure by destroying their cafe and unleashes her superweapon Martha (a parody of Adam from the actual end-credits scene of ''Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2'' and choosing the name to taunt both Batman and Superman for their mothers having the same name). The arrival of Martha to decimate the cafe is foreshadowed in further videos like the ''Wonder Woman'' and ''Spider-Man: Homecoming'' HISHE videos. At last, in the ''Justice League'' HISHE video, Martha (voiced by [[TheOdd1sOut|James Rallison]]) arrives and succeeds in his primary objective of destroying the cafe but upon facing the Justice League, joined by Green Lantern, who comically resembles [[Steve Trevor]], gets his neck snapped by Superman, much to the irritation of Batman, who had wanted to take down Martha through his own plan. The cafe is later rebuilt by Black Panther in the ''Black Panther'' HISHE video.\n\n=== Super Cafe episodes ===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"width:100%;\"\n|-\n! style=\"background:#F0DC82; color:#240; text-align:center;\"|Number\n!! style=\"background:#F0DC82; color:#001; text-align:center;\"|Title\n!! style=\"background:#F0DC82; color:#100; text-align:center;\"|Original Upload Date \n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   =  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPZW8_ID-l4 1]\n| Title           = Super Social Network\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2012|02|02}}\n| ShortSummary    = Batman and Superman discuss their repetitive status updates on [[Twitter]].\n| LineColor       = F0DC82\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B6DMShBV6k 2]\n| Title           = Bat Phone\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2012|03|08}}\n| ShortSummary    = Superman tries to convince Batman to buy a [[smartphone]].\n| LineColor       = F0DC82\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3vDtZeo1YQ 3]\n| Title           = Bros Before Marios\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2012|05|03}}\n| ShortSummary    = [[Nintendo]] [[video game]] character [[Mario]] tries to convince Superman and Batman that he, too, is a superhero.\n| LineColor       = F0DC82\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-kyKrj4sVI 4]\n| Title           = Pros and Cons\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2012|05|07}}\n| ShortSummary    = Superman tries to convince Batman to go to [[fan convention|Comic Con]].\n| LineColor       = F0DC82\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeWpCJruFlw 5]\n| Title           = Trailer Of Steel\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2012|12|20}}\n| ShortSummary    = Superman and Batman discuss the ''[[Man of Steel (film)|Man of Steel]]'' trailer.\n| LineColor       = F0DC82\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56sEJKjD95M 6]\n| Title           = Swingers Tribute\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2013|04|11}}\n| ShortSummary    = Superman attempts to flirt with [[The Incredibles|Mrs. Incredible]] from afar.\n| LineColor       = F0DC82\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   =  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3B96ctffVp8 7]\n| Title           = Versus\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2013|07|30}}\n| ShortSummary    = Superman and Batman discuss possible titles for ''[[Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice|Batman v Superman]]'', each title reflecting the heroes' opinions as to who could defeat whom in the proposed fight.\n| LineColor       = F0DC82\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   =  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2swVic8KxY 8]\n| Title           = Who's A Hero\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2013|11|21}}\n| ShortSummary    = [[Eleventh Doctor|The Eleventh Doctor]] stops by the cafe to talk about the events in ''[[The Name of the Doctor|Doctor Who: In The Name of the Doctor]]''.\n| LineColor       = F0DC82\n}}\n{{Episode list \n| EpisodeNumber   =  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJUmSwbZANw 9]\n| Title           = And The Reboot Goes To\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2015|03|03}}\n| ShortSummary    = After [[Hollywood]] slams superhero movies for their repetitive formula, Superman and Batman discuss reboots.\n| LineColor       = F0DC82\n}}\n{{Episode list \n| EpisodeNumber   =  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QFPuyDrIIk 10]\n| Title           = Batman v Superman - It's On!\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2015|04|21}}\n| ShortSummary    = A ''[[Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice]]'' trailer provokes conflict between Superman and Batman.\n| LineColor       = F0DC82\n}}\n{{Episode list \n| EpisodeNumber   =  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KntOy6am7CM 11]\n| Title           = Batman GO\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2016|08|30}}\n| ShortSummary    = Superman's addiction to ''[[Pok\u00e9mon Go]]'' annoys Batman, who then demonstrates \"''Batman Go''\", an equivalent app that helps him hunt real criminals.\n| LineColor       = F0DC82\n}}\n{{Episode list \n| EpisodeNumber   =  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KntOy6am7CM 12]\n| Title           = The Last Trailer\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2017|04|20}}\n| ShortSummary    = Superman and Batman get into conflict with the new ''[[Star Wars: The Last Jedi]]'' and ''[[Justice League (film)|Justice League]]'' trailer.\n| LineColor       = F0DC82\n}}\n{{Episode list \n| EpisodeNumber   =  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zg46XxztfUs 13]\n| Title           =  Teens and Titans\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2018|08|16}}\n| ShortSummary    = Following the release of [[Teen Titans Go!

YouTube|via=YouTube |accessdate=22 February 2017}}</ref> This series aims to put the spotlight on lesser known YouTube animators or movie related channels. It is also used to bridge the gap between HISHE's own videos.\n\nThe series has been a success, both in terms of views and features, which include Ricepirate, OnlyLeigh, BrotherhoodWorkshop as well as Hank and Jed. The series has however received some criticism from fans who believe the content is not up to par with HISHE's own and could therefore damage their reputation. HISHE has responded by refuting these claims stating that it is beneficial to all parties involved.\n\n=== HISHE Kids ===\nHISHE launched an additional channel called HISHE Kids, with the show ''Fixed Fairy Tales''.\n\n== Super Cafe / Villain's Pub ==\nThe ''Super Cafe / Villain's Pub'' is a segment that debuted at the end of ''How Superman Should Have Ended'' which featured [[Superman]] discussing the alternate events of the 1978 ''[[Superman (1978 film)|Superman]]'' film in a cafe with [[Batman]], which began the trend of the ''Super Cafe''. Though it is thought to be based on ''[[Seinfeld]]'', the clips are actually based on the final scene of Daniel Baxter's favorite film, ''[[Swingers (1996 film)|Swingers]]'', with Superman standing in for Trent and Batman standing in for Mike.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=56sEJKjD95M|title=Super Cafe: Swingers Tribute|first=|last=How It Should Have Ended|date=11 April 2013|publisher=|accessdate=22 February 2017|via=YouTube}}</ref>\n\nIn various superhero episodes of ''How it Should have Ended'', altered or added scenes are shown from the superhero film, followed by the superheroes that appear in the movie interacting with Batman and Superman (both voiced by Daniel Baxter) in the Super Cafe; it also always appears at the end of each episode. The Super Cafe segment is featured in every superhero film the series has covered so far. Superman and Batman also make a brief appearance in a cafe in the ''How [[Pulp Fiction]] Should Have Ended''. The segment was also used in the [[Nostalgia Critic]]'s review of ''Man of Steel''.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://thatguywiththeglasses.com/videolinks/thatguywiththeglasses/nostalgia-critic/41449-man-of-steel|title= Man of Steel|date= November 2, 2013|website= That Guy With the Glasses|publisher= [[Nostalgia Critic]]|accessdate= December 22, 2013}}</ref> A companion segment called the \"Villain Pub\" which is modeled from [[Cheers]] and features many popular villains like [[Loki (comics)|Loki]], [[Joker (comics)|the Joker]], [[Lord Voldemort|Voldemort]] and many more began with ''How [[Thor: The Dark World]] Should Have Ended''. In those segments, [[Emperor Palpatine]] is the bartender and [[Bowser (character)|Bowser]] is the bouncer (bownser). The [[Where Everybody Knows Your Name|Cheers Theme Song]] was rewritten as a theme.\n\nThere are numerous running gags in the Super Cafe segments, the most notable being in which Batman always explains his various accomplishments and abilities or finds some kind of excuse to say his catchphrase ''\"Because I'm Batman!\"'', much to Superman's irritation. In the ''Suicide Squad'' HISHE, Batman discovers the Villain Pub and in the Villain Pub episode \"Boss Battle\", goes to confront the villains congregating there, nearly successfully, only to be tempted by Emperor Palpatine by his weakness \u2013 the ladies. It is then that Harley Quinn, who had used her vexing charms to be allowed back into the pub, knocks out Batman from behind. Batman is then taken into the cellar to be fed to the shark Jaws, who is comically depicted as talking in a high-pitched voice, chained up and stripped of his equipment. He barely escapes after being rescued by Dr. Strange, a fact that is reiterated in the ''Doctor Strange'' HISHE (which also cryptically contained a spoiler for the ''Avengers: Infinity War'' trailer). Later, in the ''Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2'' HISHE, things begin to take a turn for the dire when Ayesha, disgusted by heroes congregating in a cafe to meet, decides to punish superheroes whom she blames for her failure by destroying their cafe and unleashes her superweapon Martha (a parody of Adam from the actual end-credits scene of ''Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2'' and choosing the name to taunt both Batman and Superman for their mothers having the same name). The arrival of Martha to decimate the cafe is foreshadowed in further videos like the ''Wonder Woman'' and ''Spider-Man: Homecoming'' HISHE videos. At last, in the ''Justice League'' HISHE video, Martha (voiced by [[TheOdd1sOut|James Rallison]]) arrives and succeeds in his primary objective of destroying the cafe but upon facing the Justice League, joined by Green Lantern, who comically resembles [[Steve Trevor]], gets his neck snapped by Superman, much to the irritation of Batman, who had wanted to take down Martha through his own plan.

In 1570, he enlisted in a [[Spanish Marine Infantry|Spanish Navy infantry]] regiment, and was badly wounded at the [[Battle of Lepanto]] in October 1571. He served as a soldier until 1575, when he was captured by [[Barbary pirates]]; after five years in captivity, he was ransomed, and returned to [[Madrid]].\n\nHis first significant novel, titled ''[[La Galatea]]'', was published in 1585, but he continued to work as a purchasing agent, then later a government [[tax collector]]. Part One of ''Don Quixote'' was published in 1605, and its immediate success allowed him to write full time for the first time. \n\nPart Two of ''Don Quixote'' was published in 1615, other publications include ''[[Novelas ejemplares]]'', or ''Exemplary Novels'', ''[[Viaje del Parnaso]]'', or ''Journey to Parnassus'', and ''Ocho comedias y ocho entremeses''. ''[[Los trabajos de Persiles y Sigismunda]]'', or ''The Travails of Persiles and Sigismunda'', was published after his death in 1616.\n\n==Biography==\n[[File:Capilla_del_Oidor%2C_Alcal\u00e1_de_Henares.jpg|thumb|''Santa Mar\u00eda la Mayor'', in [[Alcal\u00e1 de Henares]], where Cervantes was reputedly baptised; the square in front is named ''Plaza Cervantes'']]\nDespite his subsequent fame, much of Cervantes' life is uncertain, including his name, background and what he looked like. Although he signed himself ''Cerbantes'', his printers used ''Cervantes'', which became the common form. In later life, Cervantes used ''Saavedra'', the name of a distant relative, rather than the more usual ''Cortinas'', after his mother.{{sfn|Garc\u00e9s|2002|p=189}}\n\nAnother area of dispute are his ethnic origins. In the 16th century, many Spaniards were descended either from [[Morisco]]s, Muslims who remained after the conquest of [[Emirate_of_Granada|Granada]] in 1492, or [[Converso]]s, Jews who converted to Catholicism after [[Expulsion_of_Jews_from_Spain|expulsion from Spain in 1492]]. An estimated 20% of the Spanish population in the south fell into one of these categories, and it has been suggested Cervantes' mother may have been one of these [[New Christians]].{{sfn|Byron|1978|p=32}} However, others refute this theory.{{sfn|Lokos|p=116}} \n\nNo confirmed portrait of the author is known to exist.

He was the second son of [[barber-surgeon]] Rodrigo de Cervantes and his wife, Leonor de Cortinas (ca 1520-1593).{{sfn|McCrory|2006|p=35}} Rodrigo came from [[C\u00f3rdoba, Andalusia]], where his father Juan de Cervantes was an influential lawyer.{{sfn|McCrory|2006|p=32}} \n\nRodrigo was frequently in debt, or searching for work, and moved constantly. Leonor came from [[Arganda del Rey]], and died in October 1593, at the age of 73; surviving legal documents indicate she had seven children, could read and write, and was a resourceful individual with an eye for business. When Rodrigo was imprisoned for debt from October 1553 to April 1554, she supported the family on her own.{{sfn|McCrory|2006|p=34}}     \n\nCervantes' siblings were Andr\u00e9s (born 1543), Andrea (born 1544), Luisa (born 1546), Rodrigo (born 1550), Magdalena (born 1554) and Juan. They lived in C\u00f3rdoba until 1556, when his grandfather died; for reasons that are unclear, Rodrigo did not benefit from his will, and the family disappears until 1564, when he filed a lawsuit in [[Seville]].{{sfn|McCrory|2006|p=36}}\n\nSeville was then in the midst of an economic boom, and Rodrigo managed rented accommodation for his elder brother Andres, who was a junior magistrate. It is assumed Cervantes attended the Jesuit college in Seville, where one of the teachers was Jesuit playwright Pedro Pablo Acevedo, who moved there in 1561 from C\u00f3rdoba.{{sfn|Egginton|2016|p=23}} However, legal records show his father got into debt once more, and in 1566, the family moved to [[Madrid]].{{sfn|McCrory|2006|pp=40-41}}\n\n===1566 to 1580; Military service and captivity===\n[[File:Cervantes Burgos.JPG|thumb|upright|left|Bust of Cervantes erected in 1905, [[Burgos]].]]\nIn the 19th century, a biographer discovered an arrest warrant for a Miguel de Cervantes, dated 15 September 1569, who was charged with wounding Antonio de Sigura in a duel.{{sfn|McCrory|2006|p=48}} Although disputed at the time, largely on the grounds such behaviour was unworthy of so great an author, it is now accepted as the most likely reason for Cervantes leaving Madrid.{{sfn|Lokos|2016|p=118}}\n\nHe eventually made his way to [[Rome]], where he found a position in the household of Giulio Acquaviva, an Italian bishop who spent 1568 to 1569 in Madrid, and was appointed [[Cardinal_(Catholic_Church)|Cardinal]] in 1570.{{sfn|McCrory|2006|p=50}} When the 1570 to 1573 [[Ottoman\u2013Venetian_War_(1570\u20131573)|Ottoman\u2013Venetian War]] began, Spain formed part of the [[Holy_League_(1571)|Holy League]], a coalition formed to support the [[Republic_of_Venice|Venetian Republic]]. Possibly seeing an opportunity to have his arrest warrant rescinded, Cervantes went to [[Kingdom_of_Naples|Naples]], then part of the [[Crown of Aragon]].{{sfn|McCrory|2006|p=52}} \n[[File:Nafpaktos evlahos.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Statue of Miguel de Cervantes at the harbour of [[Naupactus]] (Lepanto)]]\nThe military commander in Naples was Alvaro de Sande, a friend of the family, who gave Cervantes a commission under the [[\u00c1lvaro_de_Baz\u00e1n,_1st_Marquess_of_Santa_Cruz|Marquis de Santa Cruz]]. At some point, he was joined in Naples by his younger brother Rodrigo.{{sfn|McCrory|2006|p=52}} In September 1571, Cervantes sailed on board the ''Marquesa'', part of the Holy League fleet under Don [[John of Austria]], illegitimate half brother of [[Philip II of Spain|Phillip II of Spain]]; on 7 October, they defeated the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] fleet at the [[Battle of Lepanto]].{{sfn|Davis|1999|p=199}} \n\nAccording to his own account, although suffering from malaria, Cervantes was given command of a 12-man [[skiff]], small boats used for assaulting enemy galleys. The ''Marquesa'' lost 40 dead, and 120 wounded, including Cervantes, who received three separate wounds, two in the chest, and another that rendered his left arm useless. His actions at Lepanto were a source of pride to the end of his life,{{efn|In the Preface to Volume 2 of ''Don Quixote'', he writes ''the loss of my hand (came about) on the grandest occasion the past or present has seen, or the future can hope to see. If my wounds have no beauty to the beholder's eye, they are, at least, honorable in the estimation of those who know where they were received.''{{sfn|Cervantes|2015|p=20}}}} while Don John approved no less than four separate pay increases for him.{{sfn|McCrory|2006|p=58}} \n\nIn ''[[Viaje_del_Parnaso|Journey to Parnassus]]'', published two years before his death in 1616, Cervantes claimed to have \"lost the movement of the left hand for the glory of the right\".{{sfn|Ma|2017|p=99}} As with much else, the extent of his disability is unclear, the only source being Cervantes himself, while commentators cite his habitual tendency to praise himself.{{efn|per Seg\u00fan Nicol\u00e1s Mar\u00edn; \"No hay ocasi\u00f3n en que Cervantes no se elogie, bien que excus\u00e1ndose por salir de los l\u00edmites de su natural modestia; tantas veces ocurre esto que no es posible verla nunca ni creer en ella\"}} {{sfn|Eisenberg|1996|pp=32\u201353}} However, they were serious enough to earn him six months in hospital at [[Messina]], [[Sicily]].They also caused him to fart a lot{{sfn|Fitzmaurice-Kelly|1892|p=33}} \n\nAlthough he returned to service in July 1572, records show his chest wounds were still not completely healed in February 1573.{{sfn|McCrory|2006|p=60}} Based mainly in Naples, he joined expeditions to [[Corfu]] and [[Pylos|Navarino]], and took part in the 1573 occupation of [[Tunis]] and [[La Goulette]], which were [[Conquest_of_Tunis_(1574)|recaptured]] by the Ottomans in 1574.{{sfn|Garc\u00e9s|2002|pp=191\u2013192, 220}} Despite Lepanto, the war overall was an Ottoman victory, and the loss of Tunis a military disaster for Spain.

This made finding employment difficult; other than a period in 1581 to 1582, when he was employed as an intelligence agent in North Africa, little is known of his movements prior to 1584.{{sfn|McCrory|2006|pp=100-101}} \n\nIn April of that year, Cervantes visited [[Esquivias]], to help arrange the affairs of his recently deceased friend and minor poet, Pedro Lainez. Here he met Catalina de Salazar y Palacios (ca 1560?-1626), eldest daughter of the widowed Catalina de Palacios; her husband died leaving only debts, but the elder Catalina owned some land of her own. This may be why in December 1584, Cervantes married her daughter, then between 15 and 18 years old.{{sfn|McCrory|2006|pp=115-116}} The first use of the name ''Cervantes Saavedra'' appears in 1586, on documents related to his marriage.{{sfn|Garc\u00e9s|2002|p=189}}\n\nShortly before this, his illegitimate daughter Isabel was born in November.

Such positions were unpaid, and assumed the holder lived on what they kept, which meant a degree of 'corruption' was expected. They were also subject to price fluctuations, which could go either way; he was briefly jailed several times for 'irregularities', but quickly released.

Such works were extremely short-lived, and even [[Lope de Vega]], the best-known playwright of the day, could not live on their proceeds.{{sfn|McCrory|2006|p=112}} In 1585, he published ''La Galatea'', a conventional [[Pastoral|pastoral romance]] that received little contemporary notice; despite promising to write a sequel, he never did so.{{sfn|McCrory|2006|pp=110-111}}\n\nAside from these, and some poems, by 1605, Cervantes had not been published for 20 years. In ''Don Quixote'', he challenged a form of literature that had been a favourite for more than a century, explicitly stating his purpose was to undermine 'vain and empty' [[chivalric romance]]s.{{sfn|Close|2008|p=39}} His portrayal of real life, and use of everyday speech in a literary context was considered innovative, and proved instantly popular. First published in January 1605, Don Quixote and Sancho Panza featured in masquerades held to celebrate the birth of [[Philip_IV_of_Spain|Philip IV]] on 8 April.{{sfn|McCrory|2006|p=206}} \n[[File:Don Quijote illustrated by Gustav Dore V.jpg|thumb|upright|right|An illustration from ''Don Quijote'', by Gustave Dor\u00e9]]\nHe finally achieved a degree of financial security, while its popularity led to demands for a sequel. In the foreword to his 1613 work, ''Novelas ejemplares'', dedicated to his patron, the Count of Lemos, Cervantes promises to produce one, but was pre-empted by an unauthorised version published in 1614, published under the name [[Alonso Fern\u00e1ndez de Avellaneda]]. It is possible this delay was deliberate, to ensure support from his publisher and reading public; Cervantes finally produced the second part of ''Don Quixote'' in 1615.{{sfn|McCrory|2006|pp=234-235}}\n\nThe two parts of ''Don Quixote'' are different in focus, but similar in their clarity of prose, and realism; the first was more comic, and had greater popular appeal.{{sfn|Mitsuo|2006|pp=148-152}} The second part is often considered more sophisticated and complex, with a greater depth of characterisation and philosophical insight.{{sfn|Putnam|1976|p=14}}  \n\nIn addition to this, he produced a series of works between 1613 and his death in 1616. They include a collection of tales titled ''Exemplary Novels'', similar in style to [[picaresque novel]]s written by [[Lazarillo de Tormes]]. This was followed by ''Viaje del Parnaso'', or ''Eight Comedies and Eight New Interludes'', and ''[[Los trabajos de Persiles y Sigismunda]]'', completed just before his death, and published posthumously in January 1617.\n\nHe was rediscovered by English writers in the mid-18th century; literary editor [[John Bowle (writer)|John Bowle]] argued Cervantes was as significant as any of the Greek and Roman authors then popular, and published an annotated edition in 1781. Now viewed as a significant work, at the time it proved a failure.{{sfn|Truman|2003|pp=9-31}} However, ''Don Quixote'' has been translated into all major languages, in 700 editions. Mexican author [[Carlos Fuentes]] suggested Cervantes and his contemporary [[William Shakespeare]] form part of a narrative tradition, which includes [[Homer]], [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]], [[Daniel Defoe|Defoe]], [[Charles Dickens|Dickens]], [[Honor\u00e9 de Balzac|Balzac]], and [[James Joyce|Joyce]].{{sfn|Fuentes|1988|p=69\u201370}} \n\n[[Sigmund Freud]] claimed he learnt Spanish to read Cervantes in the original; he particularly admired ''El coloquio de los perros'', or ''[[The_Dialogue_of_the_Dogs|Dialogue of the Dogs]]'', from ''Exemplary Tales''. Two dogs, Cipi\u00f3n and Berganza,  share their stories; as one talks, the other listens, occasionally making comments. From 1871 to 1881, he and his close friend, Eduard Silberstein, wrote letters to each other, using Cipi\u00f3n and Berganza.{{sfn |Riley |1994|pp=13-14}}\n\nThe tricentennial of ''Don Quixote'''s publication in 1905 was marked with celebrations in Spain; the 400th anniversary of his death in 2016, saw the production of ''Cervantina'', a celebration of his plays by the Compa\u00f1\u00eda Nacional de Teatro Cl\u00e1sico in Madrid. The [[Biblioteca Virtual Miguel de Cervantes]], the largest [[digital archive]] of Spanish-language historical and literary works in the world, is named after the author.{{cn|date=December 2019}}\n\n==Bibilography==\n[[File:La Galatea First Edition Title Page.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Cervantes' ''La Galatea'' (1585), original title page.]]\n*''[[La Galatea]]'' (1585); \n*''El ingenioso hidalgo Don Quixote de la Mancha'' (1605): First volume of ''[[Don Quixote]]''.\n* ''[[Novelas ejemplares]]'' (1613): a collection of 12 short stories of varied types about the social, political, and historical problems of Cervantes' Spain:\n** \"[[La gitanilla]]\" (\"The Gypsy Girl\")\n** \"El amante liberal\" (\"The Generous Lover\")\n** \"Rinconete y Cortadillo\" (\"Rinconete & Cortadillo\")\n** \"La espa\u00f1ola inglesa\" (\"The English Spanish Lady\")\n** \"[[El licenciado Vidriera]]\" (\"The Lawyer of Glass\")\n** \"La fuerza de la sangre\" (\"The Power of Blood\")\n** \"[[El celoso extreme\u00f1o]]\" (\"The Jealous Man From Extremadura\")<ref name=\"Br\"/>\n** \"La ilustre fregona\" (\"The Illustrious Kitchen-Maid\")\n** \"Novela de las dos doncellas\" (\"The Novel of the Two Damsels\")\n** \"Novela de la se\u00f1ora Cornelia\" (\"The Novel of Lady Cornelia\")\n** \"Novela del casamiento enga\u00f1oso\" (\"The Novel of the Deceitful Marriage\")\n** \"[[El coloquio de los perros]]\" (\"The Dialogue of the Dogs\")\n* ''Segunda Parte del Ingenioso Cavallero [sic] Don Quixote de la Mancha'' (1615): Second volume of ''[[Don Quixote]]''.\n* ''[[Los trabajos de Persiles y Sigismunda]]'' (1617). \n\n==Other works==\n[[File:Viaje del Parnaso.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Frontispiece of the ''Viaje'' (1614)]]\nGenerally considered a mediocre poet, few survive; some appear in ''[[La Galatea]]'', while he also wrote ''Dos Canciones \u00e0 la Armada Invencible''. \n\nHis [[sonnets]] are considered his best work, particularly ''Al T\u00famulo del Rey Felipe en Sevilla'', ''Canto de Cal\u00edope'' and ''Ep\u00edstola a Mateo V\u00e1zquez''.

In 1570, he enlisted in a [[Spanish Marine Infantry|Spanish Navy infantry]] regiment, and was badly wounded at the [[Battle of Lepanto]] in October 1571. He served as a soldier until 1575, when he was captured by [[Barbary pirates]]; after five years in captivity, he was ransomed, and returned to [[Madrid]].\n\nHis first significant novel, titled ''[[La Galatea]]'', was published in 1585, but he continued to work as a purchasing agent, then later a government [[tax collector]]. Part One of ''Don Quixote'' was published in 1605, and its immediate success allowed him to write full time for the first time. \n\nPart Two of ''Don Quixote'' was published in 1615, other publications include ''[[Novelas ejemplares]]'', or ''Exemplary Novels'', ''[[Viaje del Parnaso]]'', or ''Journey to Parnassus'', and ''Ocho comedias y ocho entremeses''. ''[[Los trabajos de Persiles y Sigismunda]]'', or ''The Travails of Persiles and Sigismunda'', was published after his death in 1616.\n\n==Biography==\n[[File:Capilla_del_Oidor%2C_Alcal\u00e1_de_Henares.jpg|thumb|''Santa Mar\u00eda la Mayor'', in [[Alcal\u00e1 de Henares]], where Cervantes was reputedly baptised; the square in front is named ''Plaza Cervantes'']]\nDespite his subsequent fame, much of Cervantes' life is uncertain, including his name, background and what he looked like. Although he signed himself ''Cerbantes'', his printers used ''Cervantes'', which became the common form. In later life, Cervantes used ''Saavedra'', the name of a distant relative, rather than the more usual ''Cortinas'', after his mother.{{sfn|Garc\u00e9s|2002|p=189}}\n\nAnother area of dispute are his ethnic origins. In the 16th century, many Spaniards were descended either from [[Morisco]]s, Muslims who remained after the conquest of [[Emirate_of_Granada|Granada]] in 1492, or [[Converso]]s, Jews who converted to Catholicism after [[Expulsion_of_Jews_from_Spain|expulsion from Spain in 1492]]. An estimated 20% of the Spanish population in the south fell into one of these categories, and it has been suggested Cervantes' mother may have been one of these [[New Christians]].{{sfn|Byron|1978|p=32}} However, others refute this theory.{{sfn|Lokos|p=116}} \n\nNo confirmed portrait of the author is known to exist.

He was the second son of [[barber-surgeon]] Rodrigo de Cervantes and his wife, Leonor de Cortinas (ca 1520-1593).{{sfn|McCrory|2006|p=35}} Rodrigo came from [[C\u00f3rdoba, Andalusia]], where his father Juan de Cervantes was an influential lawyer.{{sfn|McCrory|2006|p=32}} \n\nRodrigo was frequently in debt, or searching for work, and moved constantly. Leonor came from [[Arganda del Rey]], and died in October 1593, at the age of 73; surviving legal documents indicate she had seven children, could read and write, and was a resourceful individual with an eye for business. When Rodrigo was imprisoned for debt from October 1553 to April 1554, she supported the family on her own.{{sfn|McCrory|2006|p=34}}     \n\nCervantes' siblings were Andr\u00e9s (born 1543), Andrea (born 1544), Luisa (born 1546), Rodrigo (born 1550), Magdalena (born 1554) and Juan. They lived in C\u00f3rdoba until 1556, when his grandfather died; for reasons that are unclear, Rodrigo did not benefit from his will, and the family disappears until 1564, when he filed a lawsuit in [[Seville]].{{sfn|McCrory|2006|p=36}}\n\nSeville was then in the midst of an economic boom, and Rodrigo managed rented accommodation for his elder brother Andres, who was a junior magistrate. It is assumed Cervantes attended the Jesuit college in Seville, where one of the teachers was Jesuit playwright Pedro Pablo Acevedo, who moved there in 1561 from C\u00f3rdoba.{{sfn|Egginton|2016|p=23}} However, legal records show his father got into debt once more, and in 1566, the family moved to [[Madrid]].{{sfn|McCrory|2006|pp=40-41}}\n\n===1566 to 1580; Military service and captivity===\n[[File:Cervantes Burgos.JPG|thumb|upright|left|Bust of Cervantes erected in 1905, [[Burgos]].]]\nIn the 19th century, a biographer discovered an arrest warrant for a Miguel de Cervantes, dated 15 September 1569, who was charged with wounding Antonio de Sigura in a duel.{{sfn|McCrory|2006|p=48}} Although disputed at the time, largely on the grounds such behaviour was unworthy of so great an author, it is now accepted as the most likely reason for Cervantes leaving Madrid.{{sfn|Lokos|2016|p=118}}\n\nHe eventually made his way to [[Rome]], where he found a position in the household of Giulio Acquaviva, an Italian bishop who spent 1568 to 1569 in Madrid, and was appointed [[Cardinal_(Catholic_Church)|Cardinal]] in 1570.{{sfn|McCrory|2006|p=50}} When the 1570 to 1573 [[Ottoman\u2013Venetian_War_(1570\u20131573)|Ottoman\u2013Venetian War]] began, Spain formed part of the [[Holy_League_(1571)|Holy League]], a coalition formed to support the [[Republic_of_Venice|Venetian Republic]].

The ''Marquesa'' lost 40 dead, and 120 wounded, including Cervantes, who received three separate wounds, two in the chest, and another that rendered his left arm useless.

This made finding employment difficult; other than a period in 1581 to 1582, when he was employed as an intelligence agent in North Africa, little is known of his movements prior to 1584.{{sfn|McCrory|2006|pp=100-101}} \n\nIn April of that year, Cervantes visited [[Esquivias]], to help arrange the affairs of his recently deceased friend and minor poet, Pedro Lainez. Here he met Catalina de Salazar y Palacios (ca 1560?-1626), eldest daughter of the widowed Catalina de Palacios; her husband died leaving only debts, but the elder Catalina owned some land of her own. This may be why in December 1584, Cervantes married her daughter, then between 15 and 18 years old.{{sfn|McCrory|2006|pp=115-116}} The first use of the name ''Cervantes Saavedra'' appears in 1586, on documents related to his marriage.{{sfn|Garc\u00e9s|2002|p=189}}\n\nShortly before this, his illegitimate daughter Isabel was born in November.

Such positions were unpaid, and assumed the holder lived on what they kept, which meant a degree of 'corruption' was expected. They were also subject to price fluctuations, which could go either way; he was briefly jailed several times for 'irregularities', but quickly released.

Such works were extremely short-lived, and even [[Lope de Vega]], the best-known playwright of the day, could not live on their proceeds.{{sfn|McCrory|2006|p=112}} In 1585, he published ''La Galatea'', a conventional [[Pastoral|pastoral romance]] that received little contemporary notice; despite promising to write a sequel, he never did so.{{sfn|McCrory|2006|pp=110-111}}\n\nAside from these, and some poems, by 1605, Cervantes had not been published for 20 years. In ''Don Quixote'', he challenged a form of literature that had been a favourite for more than a century, explicitly stating his purpose was to undermine 'vain and empty' [[chivalric romance]]s.{{sfn|Close|2008|p=39}} His portrayal of real life, and use of everyday speech in a literary context was considered innovative, and proved instantly popular. First published in January 1605, Don Quixote and Sancho Panza featured in masquerades held to celebrate the birth of [[Philip_IV_of_Spain|Philip IV]] on 8 April.{{sfn|McCrory|2006|p=206}} \n[[File:Don Quijote illustrated by Gustav Dore V.jpg|thumb|upright|right|An illustration from ''Don Quijote'', by Gustave Dor\u00e9]]\nHe finally achieved a degree of financial security, while its popularity led to demands for a sequel. In the foreword to his 1613 work, ''Novelas ejemplares'', dedicated to his patron, the Count of Lemos, Cervantes promises to produce one, but was pre-empted by an unauthorised version published in 1614, published under the name [[Alonso Fern\u00e1ndez de Avellaneda]]. It is possible this delay was deliberate, to ensure support from his publisher and reading public; Cervantes finally produced the second part of ''Don Quixote'' in 1615.{{sfn|McCrory|2006|pp=234-235}}\n\nThe two parts of ''Don Quixote'' are different in focus, but similar in their clarity of prose, and realism; the first was more comic, and had greater popular appeal.{{sfn|Mitsuo|2006|pp=148-152}} The second part is often considered more sophisticated and complex, with a greater depth of characterisation and philosophical insight.{{sfn|Putnam|1976|p=14}}  \n\nIn addition to this, he produced a series of works between 1613 and his death in 1616. They include a collection of tales titled ''Exemplary Novels'', similar in style to [[picaresque novel]]s written by [[Lazarillo de Tormes]]. This was followed by ''Viaje del Parnaso'', or ''Eight Comedies and Eight New Interludes'', and ''[[Los trabajos de Persiles y Sigismunda]]'', completed just before his death, and published posthumously in January 1617.\n\nHe was rediscovered by English writers in the mid-18th century; literary editor [[John Bowle (writer)|John Bowle]] argued Cervantes was as significant as any of the Greek and Roman authors then popular, and published an annotated edition in 1781. Now viewed as a significant work, at the time it proved a failure.{{sfn|Truman|2003|pp=9-31}} However, ''Don Quixote'' has been translated into all major languages, in 700 editions. Mexican author [[Carlos Fuentes]] suggested Cervantes and his contemporary [[William Shakespeare]] form part of a narrative tradition, which includes [[Homer]], [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]], [[Daniel Defoe|Defoe]], [[Charles Dickens|Dickens]], [[Honor\u00e9 de Balzac|Balzac]], and [[James Joyce|Joyce]].{{sfn|Fuentes|1988|p=69\u201370}} \n\n[[Sigmund Freud]] claimed he learnt Spanish to read Cervantes in the original; he particularly admired ''El coloquio de los perros'', or ''[[The_Dialogue_of_the_Dogs|Dialogue of the Dogs]]'', from ''Exemplary Tales''. Two dogs, Cipi\u00f3n and Berganza,  share their stories; as one talks, the other listens, occasionally making comments. From 1871 to 1881, he and his close friend, Eduard Silberstein, wrote letters to each other, using Cipi\u00f3n and Berganza.{{sfn |Riley |1994|pp=13-14}}\n\nThe tricentennial of ''Don Quixote'''s publication in 1905 was marked with celebrations in Spain; the 400th anniversary of his death in 2016, saw the production of ''Cervantina'', a celebration of his plays by the Compa\u00f1\u00eda Nacional de Teatro Cl\u00e1sico in Madrid. The [[Biblioteca Virtual Miguel de Cervantes]], the largest [[digital archive]] of Spanish-language historical and literary works in the world, is named after the author.{{cn|date=December 2019}}\n\n==Bibilography==\n[[File:La Galatea First Edition Title Page.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Cervantes' ''La Galatea'' (1585), original title page.]]\n*''[[La Galatea]]'' (1585); \n*''El ingenioso hidalgo Don Quixote de la Mancha'' (1605): First volume of ''[[Don Quixote]]''.\n* ''[[Novelas ejemplares]]'' (1613): a collection of 12 short stories of varied types about the social, political, and historical problems of Cervantes' Spain:\n** \"[[La gitanilla]]\" (\"The Gypsy Girl\")\n** \"El amante liberal\" (\"The Generous Lover\")\n** \"Rinconete y Cortadillo\" (\"Rinconete & Cortadillo\")\n** \"La espa\u00f1ola inglesa\" (\"The English Spanish Lady\")\n** \"[[El licenciado Vidriera]]\" (\"The Lawyer of Glass\")\n** \"La fuerza de la sangre\" (\"The Power of Blood\")\n** \"[[El celoso extreme\u00f1o]]\" (\"The Jealous Man From Extremadura\")<ref name=\"Br\"/>\n** \"La ilustre fregona\" (\"The Illustrious Kitchen-Maid\")\n** \"Novela de las dos doncellas\" (\"The Novel of the Two Damsels\")\n** \"Novela de la se\u00f1ora Cornelia\" (\"The Novel of Lady Cornelia\")\n** \"Novela del casamiento enga\u00f1oso\" (\"The Novel of the Deceitful Marriage\")\n** \"[[El coloquio de los perros]]\" (\"The Dialogue of the Dogs\")\n* ''Segunda Parte del Ingenioso Cavallero [sic] Don Quixote de la Mancha'' (1615): Second volume of ''[[Don Quixote]]''.\n* ''[[Los trabajos de Persiles y Sigismunda]]'' (1617). \n\n==Other works==\n[[File:Viaje del Parnaso.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Frontispiece of the ''Viaje'' (1614)]]\nGenerally considered a mediocre poet, few survive; some appear in ''[[La Galatea]]'', while he also wrote ''Dos Canciones \u00e0 la Armada Invencible''. \n\nHis [[sonnets]] are considered his best work, particularly ''Al T\u00famulo del Rey Felipe en Sevilla'', ''Canto de Cal\u00edope'' and ''Ep\u00edstola a Mateo V\u00e1zquez''.

The holiday proposal would need to overcome that obstacle before legislation can be introduced.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://abc7.com/archive/6043773/|title=Cesar Chavez supporters rally for a national holiday &#124; ABC7 Los Angeles Archive &#124; abc7.com|first=ABC7|last=Archive|website=ABC7 Los Angeles}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\nThe day highlights the legacy of Cesar Chavez, and focuses on [[Chicano]] or [[Mexican Americans]] efforts in the labor movement.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Foner|first1=Nancy|last2=Fredrickson|first2=George M.|title=Not Just Black and White: Historical and Contemporary Perspectives on Immgiration, Race, and Ethnicity in the United States|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5O6FAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA211|date=22 April 2004|publisher=Russell Sage Foundation|isbn=978-1-61044-211-4|page=211}}<br/>{{cite book|last=Tatum|first=Charles M.|title=Chicano Popular Culture, Second Edition: Que Hable El Pueblo|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dV80DwAAQBAJ&pg=PA244|date=5 September 2017|publisher=University of Arizona Press|isbn=978-0-8165-3652-8|page=244}}<br/>{{cite book|last1=Meier|first1=Matt S.|last2=Guti\u00e9rrez|first2=Margo|last3=Gutierrez|first3=Margo|title=The Mexican American Experience: An Encyclopedia|url=https://archive.org/details/mexicanamericane0000meie|url-access=registration|year=2003|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-313-31643-2|page=[https://archive.org/details/mexicanamericane0000meie/page/83 83]}}<br/>{{cite web |url=https://wearemitu.com/things-that-matter/cesar-chavez-farmworkers-activist/ |title=C\u00e9sar Ch\u00e1vez Changed The Way Our Country Treats Immigrant Farm Workers But There\u2019s Still A Lot Of Work To Be Done |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=12 June 2019 |website=Mitu |publisher= |access-date=27 February 2020 |quote=}}<br/>{{cite news |last=Clark |first=Christine |date=21 March 2012 |title=UC San Diego Salutes C\u00e9sar Ch\u00e1vez Day with Month of Activities in April |url=https://ucsdnews.ucsd.edu/pressrelease/uc_san_diego_salutes_cesar_chavez_day_with_month_of_activities_in_april |work=University of California, San Diego |location= |access-date=27 February 2020 }}</ref> Events surrounding the holiday largely ignore the actions of the [[Agricultural Workers Organizing Committee]], and its [[Filipino American]] membership and leadership, who began the [[Delano grape strike]] which propelled Cesar Chavez to international notoriety.<ref>{{cite news |last=Rojas |first=Leslie Berestein |date=1 April 2011 |title=The forgotten history of the Filipino laborers who worked with Cesar Chavez |url=https://www.scpr.org/blogs/multiamerican/2011/04/01/7203/the-asian-american-farm-worker-legacy/ |work=KPCC |location=Pasadena |access-date=27 February 2020 }}<br/>{{cite news |last=Tabafunda |first=James |date=22 November 2013 |title=Filipino American organizer\u2019s legacy ignored, but not by all |url=https://nwasianweekly.com/2013/11/filipino-american-organizers-legacy-ignored/ |work=Northwest Asian Weekly |location=Seattle |access-date=27 February 2020 }}</ref> Due to this Filipino Americans have been critical of the day's focus, which excludes acknowledgement of [[History of Filipino Americans|their history]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://fanhs-national.org/filam/fanhs-speaks-out-on-the-new-film-cesar-chavez/ |title=FANHS Speaks Out on the New Film CESAR CHAVEZ |last=Muriera |first=Ron P. |last2=Orpilla |first2=Mel |date=28 March 2014 |website= |publisher=Filipino American National Historical Society |access-date=27 February 2020 |quote=}}<br/>{{cite news |last=Oh |first=Hansook |date=27 March 2012 |title=Remembering the Delano Manongs: The Filipinos behind Chavez and Huerta |url=https://sundial.csun.edu/51119/opinions/remembering-the-delano-manongs-the-filipinos-behind-chavez-and-huerta/ |work=The Sundial |location=California State University, Northridge |access-date=27 February 2020 }}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Public holidays in the United States]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://chavez.cde.ca.gov/ModelCurriculum/Teachers/index1.aspx A Model curriculum for teaching Cesar Chavez's legacy]\n\n{{US Federal Holidays}}\n{{US Holidays}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Cesar Chavez Day}}\n[[Category:March observances]]\n[[Category:Observances in the United States by presidential proclamation]]\n[[Category:United Farm Workers]]\n[[Category:State holidays in the United States]]\n[[Category:Cesar Chavez]]\n[[Category:Birthdays]]\n", "name_user": "2600:1700:1d84:120:84ef:d224:7368:217c", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cesar_Chavez_Day"}
