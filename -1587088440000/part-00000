Its range extends from central Argentina in the south to the US\u2013Mexico border in the north, through Central and South America east of the [[Andes]]. The jaguarundi is a medium-sized cat of slender build and uniform coloration that differs significantly from other [[Neotropics|neotropical]] cats (such as the small, spotted cats in the [[genus]] ''[[Leopardus]]'') in its external appearance. In fact, the jaguarundi shows several features seen in [[mustelid]]s (such as [[otter]]s and [[weasel]]s)\u2014it has an elongated body with relatively short legs, a small, narrow head, small, round ears, a short [[snout]] and a long tail. Around twice as large as the [[domestic cat]], the jaguarundi reaches nearly {{convert|14|in|cm|abbr=on|order=flip}} at the shoulder and weighs {{convert|3.5|\u2013|7|kg|lb|abbr=on}}. There are two color [[Morph (zoology)|morph]]s\u2014gray and red.\n\nSecretive and alert, the jaguarundi is typically solitary or forms pairs in the wild, though captive individuals are gregarious. Unlike other [[Sympatry|sympatric]] cats such as [[ocelot]]s, the jaguarundi is more active during the day and hunts mainly during daytime and evening hours. Individuals live in large [[home range]]s, and are sparsely distributed within a region. The jaguarundi is an efficient climber, but typically prefers hunting on ground. It feeds on various kinds of prey, especially ground-feeding birds, reptiles, [[rodent]]s and small mammals. Mating occurs throughout the year, with peaks at different times of the year across the range. After a [[gestation period]] of 70 to 75 days, a litter of one to four kittens is born. Lifespan of up to 15 years has been recorded in captivity.\n\nJaguarundis occur in a broad array of closed as well as open habitats ranging from tropical rainforests and [[deciduous forest]]s to deserts and [[thorn scrub]]s. While they are fairly common in Brazil, Peru and Venezuela, jaguarundis may have gone [[extinct]] in the US. The [[IUCN]] lists the jaguarundi as [[Least Concern]], but populations are in decline in many parts of its range due to loss and [[Habitat fragmentation|fragmentation]] of their habitat and persecution for killing poultry.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe common name \"jaguarundi\" ({{IPAc-en|\u02cc|\u0292|\u00e6|\u0261|w|\u0259|\u02c8|r|\u028c|n|d|i}}) comes from the [[Guarani language|Old Guarani]] word ''yaguarundi'', similar to the [[Old Tupi]] word ''yawaum'di''.<ref>{{cite book |last=Ferreira |first=A.B.H. |year=1986 |title=Novo Dicion\u00e1rio da L\u00edngua Portuguesa|language=Portuguese |trans-title=New Dictionary of the Portuguese Language |edition=2nd|place=Rio de Janeiro |publisher=Nova Fronteira |page=980}}</ref><ref>{{Cite Merriam-Webster|jaguarundi|accessdate=10 April 2020}}</ref> In some [[Spanish language|Spanish]]-speaking countries, the jaguarundi is also called ''gato colorado'', ''gato moro'', ''le\u00f3n brenero'', ''leoncillo'' and ''tigrillo''.<ref name=iucn/> It is also called ''eyra'', ''gato-mourisco'', ''gato-preto'', ''gato-vermelho'' and ''maracaj\u00e1-preto'' in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=de Miranda |first1=E.E. |last2=Gambarini |first2=A. |title=Natureza, Conserva\u00e7\u00e3o e Cultura: Ensaio sobre a Rela\u00e7\u00e3o do Homem com a Natureza no Brasil |trans-title=Nature, Conservation and Culture: Essay on the Relationship between Man and Nature in Brazil |date=2003 |publisher=Metalivros |location=S\u00e3o Paulo |isbn=9788585371470 |page=113 |language=Portuguese}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |editor1-last=Nowell |editor1-first=K. |editor2-last=Jackson |editor2-first=P. |editor3-last=IUCN/SSC Cat Specialist Group |title=Wild Cats: Status Survey and Conservation Action Plan |date=1996 |publisher=IUCN |location=Gland |isbn=978-2-8317-0045-8 |page=146}}</ref>\n\n==Taxonomy==\n''Felis yagouarundi'' was the [[scientific name]] used by [[\u00c9tienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire]] in 1803 who described two [[zoological specimen|specimen]]s from Central America, including one from [[French Guiana]].<ref>{{cite book |author=Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire, \u00c9. |authorlink=\u00c9tienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire |year=1803 |title=Catalogue des Mammif\u00e8res du Museum National d'Histoire Naturelle |trans-title=Catalogue of Mammals of the National Museum of Natural History| language=French |location=Paris |publisher=Museum National d'Histoire Naturelle |page=124 |chapter=Le chat yagouarundi.

Social behavior such as grooming, growling and sniffing has been recorded. The jaguarundi has a broad vocal repertoire; 13 different calls have been recorded including chattering, purring, screaming, a 'wah-wah' call, whistling, yapping and a peculiar bird-like chirp.

Estrus lasts three to five days, marked by the female regularly rolling onto her back and [[spraying urine]]. [[Sexually mature]] males will pursue the female, not reacting to any aggressive behavior from her side. As in many other felids, the male bites the fur on the female's neck on mounting; the female lets out a loud scream on penetration.<ref name=WCoW/><ref name=ms/>\n\nAfter a [[gestation]] period of 70 to 75 days, a litter of one to four kittens is born in a den constructed in a dense thicket, hollow tree, or similar cover. The kittens are covered well with fur and the underside is marked with spots, which disappear as they age; the coat color gradually changes as the kittens grow older.<ref name=WCoW/><ref name=ceballos/> The mother starts bringing solid food for the kittens when they are around three weeks old; they simply play with it until the mother ingests it. Kittens are capable of taking solid food like birds and guinea pigs at around six weeks. Jaguarundis become sexually mature at one to three years of age. Lifespan up to 15 years has been recorded in captivity.<ref name=WCoW/><ref name=Nowak/>\n\n==Distribution and habitat==\nThe jaguarundi inhabits a wide variety of habitats\u2014from tropical rainforests and [[deciduous forest]]s to deserts and [[thorn scrub]]s.

({{IPAc-en|\u02cc|\u0292|\u00e6|\u0261|w|\u0259|\u02c8|r|\u028c|n|d|i}}) is a wild [[felidae|cat]] native to the Americas. Its range extends from central Argentina in the south to the US-Mexico border in the north, through Central and South America east of the [[Andes]]. The jaguarundi is a medium-sized cat of slender build and uniform coloration that differs significantly from other [[Neotropics|neotropical]] cats (such as the small, spotted cats in the [[genus]] ''[[Leopardus]]'') in its external appearance. In fact, the jaguarundi shows several features seen in [[mustelid]]s (such as [[otter]]s and [[weasel]]s)\u2014it has an elongated body with relatively short legs, a small, narrow head, small, round ears, a short [[snout]] and a long tail. Around twice as large as the [[domestic cat]], the jaguarundi reaches nearly {{convert|14|in|cm|abbr=on|order=flip}} at the shoulder and weighs {{convert|3.5|\u2013|7|kg|lb|abbr=on}}. There are two color [[Morph (zoology)|morph]]s\u2014gray and red.\n\nSecretive and alert, the jaguarundi is typically solitary or forms pairs in the wild, though captive individuals are gregarious. Unlike other [[Sympatry|sympatric]] cats such as [[ocelot]]s, the jaguarundi is more active during the day and hunts mainly during daytime and evening hours. Individuals live in large [[home range]]s, and are sparsely distributed within a region. The jaguarundi is an efficient climber, but typically prefers hunting on ground. It feeds on various kinds of prey, especially ground-feeding birds, reptiles, [[rodent]]s and small mammals. Mating occurs throughout the year, with peaks at different times of the year across the range. After a [[gestation period]] of 70 to 75 days, a litter of one to four kittens is born. Lifespan of up to 15 years has been recorded in captivity.\n\nJaguarundis occur in a broad array of closed as well as open habitats ranging from tropical rainforests and [[deciduous forest]]s to deserts and [[thorn scrub]]s. While they are fairly common in Brazil, Peru and Venezuela, jaguarundis may have gone [[extinct]] in the US. The [[IUCN]] lists the jaguarundi as [[Least Concern]], but populations are in decline in many parts of its range due to loss and [[Habitat fragmentation|fragmentation]] of their habitat and persecution for killing poultry.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe common name \"jaguarundi\" ({{IPAc-en|\u02cc|\u0292|\u00e6|\u0261|w|\u0259|\u02c8|r|\u028c|n|d|i}}) comes from the [[Guarani language|Old Guarani]] word ''yaguarundi'', similar to the [[Old Tupi]] word ''yawaum'di''.<ref>{{cite book |last=Ferreira |first=A.B.H. |year=1986 |title=Novo Dicion\u00e1rio da L\u00edngua Portuguesa|language=Portuguese |trans-title=New Dictionary of the Portuguese Language |edition=2nd|place=Rio de Janeiro |publisher=Nova Fronteira |page=980}}</ref><ref>{{Cite Merriam-Webster|jaguarundi|accessdate=10 April 2020}}</ref> In some [[Spanish language|Spanish]]-speaking countries, the jaguarundi is also called ''gato colorado'', ''gato moro'', ''le\u00f3n brenero'', ''leoncillo'' and ''tigrillo''.<ref name=iucn/> It is also called ''eyra'', ''gato-mourisco'', ''gato-preto'', ''gato-vermelho'' and ''maracaj\u00e1-preto'' in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=de Miranda |first1=E.E. |last2=Gambarini |first2=A. |title=Natureza, Conserva\u00e7\u00e3o e Cultura: Ensaio sobre a Rela\u00e7\u00e3o do Homem com a Natureza no Brasil |trans-title=Nature, Conservation and Culture: Essay on the Relationship between Man and Nature in Brazil |date=2003 |publisher=Metalivros |location=S\u00e3o Paulo |isbn=9788585371470 |page=113 |language=Portuguese}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |editor1-last=Nowell |editor1-first=K. |editor2-last=Jackson |editor2-first=P. |editor3-last=IUCN/SSC Cat Specialist Group |title=Wild Cats: Status Survey and Conservation Action Plan |date=1996 |publisher=IUCN |location=Gland |isbn=978-2-8317-0045-8 |page=146}}</ref>\n\n==Taxonomy==\n''Felis yagouarundi'' was the [[scientific name]] used by [[\u00c9tienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire]] in 1803 who described two [[zoological specimen|specimen]]s from Central America, including one from [[French Guiana]].<ref>{{cite book |author=Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire, \u00c9. |authorlink=\u00c9tienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire |year=1803 |title=Catalogue des Mammif\u00e8res du Museum National d'Histoire Naturelle |trans-title=Catalogue of Mammals of the National Museum of Natural History| language=French |location=Paris |publisher=Museum National d'Histoire Naturelle |page=124 |chapter=Le chat yagouarundi.

Social behavior such as grooming, growling and sniffing has been recorded. The jaguarundi has a broad vocal repertoire; 13 different calls have been recorded including chattering, purring, screaming, a 'wah-wah' call, whistling, yapping and a peculiar bird-like chirp.

Estrus lasts three to five days, marked by the female regularly rolling onto her back and [[spraying urine]]. [[Sexually mature]] males will pursue the female, not reacting to any aggressive behavior from her side. As in many other felids, the male bites the fur on the female's neck on mounting; the female lets out a loud scream on penetration.<ref name=WCoW/><ref name=ms/>\n\nAfter a [[gestation]] period of 70 to 75 days, a litter of one to four kittens is born in a den constructed in a dense thicket, hollow tree, or similar cover. The kittens are covered well with fur and the underside is marked with spots, which disappear as they age; the coat color gradually changes as the kittens grow older.<ref name=WCoW/><ref name=ceballos/> The mother starts bringing solid food for the kittens when they are around three weeks old; they simply play with it until the mother ingests it. Kittens are capable of taking solid food like birds and guinea pigs at around six weeks. Jaguarundis become sexually mature at one to three years of age. Lifespan up to 15 years has been recorded in captivity.<ref name=WCoW/><ref name=Nowak/>\n\n==Distribution and habitat==\nThe jaguarundi inhabits a wide variety of habitats\u2014from tropical rainforests and [[deciduous forest]]s to deserts and [[thorn scrub]]s.

The film was followed by a spin-off [[Clueless (TV series)|television sitcom]], [[Clueless (novels)|series of books]], and Paramount Studios has announced that they are producing a remake.\n\n==Plot==\nCher Horowitz lives in a Beverly Hills mansion with her father Mel, a $500-an-hour [[litigator]]; her mother died during a routine [[liposuction]] procedure when Cher was a baby. Cher is attractive, popular, and wealthy. She attends Bronson Alcott High School with her best friend, Dionne Davenport, who is also wealthy and beautiful. Dionne has a long-term relationship with popular student Murray; Cher claims that this is a pointless endeavor for Dionne.\n\nJosh, Cher's socially conscious ex-stepbrother, visits her during a break from college. They spar continually but playfully. She mocks his idealism, while he teases her for being selfish, vain and superficial, saying that her only direction in life is \"toward the mall\". Cher plays matchmaker for two hard-grading teachers at her school, Mr. Hall and Miss Geist. She facilitates the relationship between the teachers to make them relax their grading standards so she can renegotiate a bad grade on her report card. After she sees their newfound happiness, she realizes she enjoys doing good deeds. She then decides to give back to the community by \"adopting\" a \"tragically [[Hip (slang)|unhip]]\" new girl at school, Tai Frasier. Cher and Dionne give Tai a makeover, which gives Tai confidence and a sense of style. Cher also tries to extinguish the attraction between Tai and Travis Birkenstock, an amiable skateboarding slacker, and to steer her towards Elton, a popular and wealthy student.\n\nElton rejects Tai and fails to seduce Cher. A handsome new student at their school named Christian becomes Cher's target boyfriend. Murray explains to Cher and Dionne that Christian is gay. Despite the failure of this endeavor, Cher remains on friendly terms with Christian, primarily due to her admiration of his taste in art and fashion. Matters take a turn for the worse when Tai's newfound popularity strains her relationship with Cher. Cher's frustration escalates when she fails her driving test and cannot change the result. When she returns home, crushed, Tai confesses her feelings for Josh and wants Cher's help in pursuing him. Cher says Tai is not right for Josh and they quarrel. Their disagreement ends with Tai calling Cher a \"virgin who can't drive\". Feeling \"totally clueless\", Cher reflects on her priorities and her repeated failures to understand or appreciate the people in her life.\n\nAfter thinking about why she is bothered by Tai's interest in Josh, Cher realizes that she loves him. She begins making awkward but sincere efforts to live a more purposeful life, including captaining the school's [[Pismo Beach]] disaster relief effort. Cher and Josh eventually admit their feelings for one another, culminating in a tender kiss. Ultimately, Mr. Hall and Miss Geist wed; Cher's friendships with Tai and Dionne are solidified; Tai and Travis are in love and Cher catches the wedding bouquet, helping Josh win a $200 bet. She embraces Josh and they kiss.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Anchor|Cast}}\n{{See also|List of Clueless characters}}\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Alicia Silverstone]] as Cher Horowitz\n* [[Stacey Dash]] as Dionne Davenport\n* [[Brittany Murphy]] as Tai Frasier\n* [[Paul Rudd]] as Josh Lucas\n* Paige Vlahopoulos as papa smurf\n* [[Dan Hedaya]] as Melvin \"Mel\" Horowitz (\"Hamilton\" in the credits)\n* [[Elisa Donovan]] as Amber Mariens\n* [[Justin Walker (actor)|Justin Walker]] as Christian Stovitz\n*[[Wallace Shawn]] as Mr. Wendell Hall\n*[[Twink Caplan]] as Ms. Toby Geist\n*[[Julie Brown]] as Coach Millie Stoeger\n*[[Donald Faison]] as Murray Duvall, Dionne's long-term boyfriend\n*[[Breckin Meyer]] as Travis Birkenstock\n*[[Jeremy Sisto]] as Elton Tiscia\n*[[Nicole Bilderback]] as Summer Han\n*Sean Holland as Lawrence\n{{Div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nAccording to the special feature titled \"''Creative Writing''\", Heckerling describes the origins of ''Clueless'' as follows:\n{{quote|I went to [[20th Century Fox]] and they said \"We want you to do something about teenagers.\" And I thought \"I'm so tired about doing stuff about teenagers.\" But they said, \"We want you to do something about the 'in' crowd.\" I thought \"I'll do it if I can make fun of them.\" So, we developed this script. It was a pilot for a TV show. And it was about this girl that was completely happy, no matter what happened. And I was really getting into that kind of character. But nothing happened with it.

This is first seen within the first fifteen minutes of the film when both she and Dionne pair their English teacher with the school's Debate teacher. However, this is more prominently reflected when Cher does everything in her power to pair her newest friend Tai. While both Emma and Cher mean well in their matchmaking attempts, neither of them realizes the depths of their actions nor their feelings towards Josh/Mr. Knightly until Tai/Harriet asks her to set her up with Josh/Mr. Knightley.\n\n'''Josh/Mr. Knightley''' \u2013 Cher's stepbrother, who she finds utterly repulsive. She states at the beginning of the movie that she has no positive feelings towards Josh in the slightest. The two bicker on a near constant basis. However, as the movie progresses, Josh is shown to be more caring and considerate towards Cher, becoming defensive towards her choices of men and life choices. It is not until the end of the movie it is revealed that Josh is in love with Cher and the two share a passionate kiss. \n\n'''Miss Geist/Miss Taylor/Mrs. Weston''' \u2013 Target of Cher's matchmaking.\n\n'''Tai/Harriet Smith''' \u2013 Tai, representative of the young, fair, and socially awkward Harriet Smith, is a newcomer to Bronson Alcott High School. Soon after, she is swept off her feet by both Cher and Dionne as they help her (unintentionally) become the most popular girl in school, much to Cher's jealousy. At the beginning of the film, Tai is attracted to Travis, a well-meaning, skateboard riding, pot smoker social recluse though is encouraged by Cher to strive for someone more socially well off, as Travis is not considered to be a socially acceptable partner. Following this advice, Tai then falls for Josh, much to even more of Cher's Jealousy.\n\n'''Mel Horowitz/Mr. Henry Woodhouse''' \u2013 Just as in the book, Mr. Horowitz is a well known and respected man within his circle of friends, though there is one major difference between both characters: while Mr. Horowitz is shown to have little to no care for his health, Mr. Woodhouse is considered to be a [[valetudinarian]]. Both characters are shown to love their daughter greatly while not always being so forward in their affection.\n\n'''Travis/Robert Martin''' \u2013 A stoner and a skater who falls for Tai by the end of the film; however, their attempts at courtship are derailed for a time by Cher's attempts to set Tai up with Elton. Travis is an underachiever, constantly late for class and often receiving poor grades.\n\n'''Elton Tascia/Philip Elton''' \u2013 Elton is a popular student whom Cher attempts to fix up with Tai. As is the case with the Elton from the book, he is not interested in Tai/Harriet and mistakenly believes that Cher/Emma is interested in him.\n\n'''Christian/Frank Churchill''' \u2013 The initially appealing love interest of Cher with whom she convinces herself she must be in love (just like the Frank Churchill character in the book). In the book, Churchill is not available to Emma because he is already engaged; in the film, Christian is not available to Cher because he is gay. Both characters engage in surface-level flirting with the heroine and make her consider her own feelings.\n\n==Home media==\n''Clueless'' was released on [[VHS]] and [[LaserDisc]] on December 19, 1995 by [[Paramount Home Video]]. It was released on [[DVD-Video|DVD]] on October 19, 1999.

The film was followed by a spin-off [[Clueless (TV series)|television sitcom]], [[Clueless (novels)|series of books]], and Paramount Studios has announced that they are producing a remake.\n\n==Plot==\nCher Horowitz lives in a Beverly Hills mansion with her father Mel, a $500-an-hour [[litigator]]; her mother died during a routine [[liposuction]] procedure when Cher was a baby. Cher is attractive, popular, and wealthy. She attends Bronson Alcott High School with her best friend, Dionne Davenport, who is also wealthy and beautiful. Dionne has a long-term relationship with popular student Murray; Cher claims that this is a pointless endeavor for Dionne.\n\nJosh, Cher's socially conscious ex-stepbrother, visits her during a break from college. They spar continually but playfully. She mocks his idealism, while he teases her for being selfish, vain and superficial, saying that her only direction in life is \"toward the mall\". Cher plays matchmaker for two hard-grading teachers at her school, Mr. Hall and Miss Geist. She facilitates the relationship between the teachers to make them relax their grading standards so she can renegotiate a bad grade on her report card. After she sees their newfound happiness, she realizes she enjoys doing good deeds. She then decides to give back to the community by \"adopting\" a \"tragically [[Hip (slang)|unhip]]\" new girl at school, Tai Frasier. Cher and Dionne give Tai a makeover, which gives Tai confidence and a sense of style. Cher also tries to extinguish the attraction between Tai and Travis Birkenstock, an amiable skateboarding slacker, and to steer her towards Elton, a popular and wealthy student.\n\nElton rejects Tai and fails to seduce Cher. A handsome new student at their school named Christian becomes Cher's target boyfriend. Murray explains to Cher and Dionne that Christian is gay. Despite the failure of this endeavor, Cher remains on friendly terms with Christian, primarily due to her admiration of his taste in art and fashion. Matters take a turn for the worse when Tai's newfound popularity strains her relationship with Cher. Cher's frustration escalates when she fails her driving test and cannot change the result. When she returns home, crushed, Tai confesses her feelings for Josh and wants Cher's help in pursuing him. Cher says Tai is not right for Josh and they quarrel. Their disagreement ends with Tai calling Cher a \"virgin who can't drive\". Feeling \"totally clueless\", Cher reflects on her priorities and her repeated failures to understand or appreciate the people in her life.\n\nAfter thinking about why she is bothered by Tai's interest in Josh, Cher realizes that she loves him. She begins making awkward but sincere efforts to live a more purposeful life, including captaining the school's [[Pismo Beach]] disaster relief effort. Cher and Josh eventually admit their feelings for one another, culminating in a tender kiss. Ultimately, Mr. Hall and Miss Geist wed; Cher's friendships with Tai and Dionne are solidified; Tai and Travis are in love and Cher catches the wedding bouquet, helping Josh win a $200 bet. She embraces Josh and they kiss.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Anchor|Cast}}\n{{See also|List of Clueless characters}}\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Alicia Silverstone]] as Cher Horowitz\n* [[Stacey Dash]] as Dionne Davenport\n* [[Brittany Murphy]] as Tai Frasier\n* [[Paul Rudd]] as Josh Lucas\n* [[Dan Hedaya]] as Melvin \"Mel\" Horowitz (\"Hamilton\" in the credits)\n* [[Elisa Donovan]] as Amber Mariens\n* [[Justin Walker (actor)|Justin Walker]] as Christian Stovitz\n*[[Wallace Shawn]] as Mr. Wendell Hall\n*[[Twink Caplan]] as Ms. Toby Geist\n*[[Julie Brown]] as Coach Millie Stoeger\n*[[Donald Faison]] as Murray Duvall, Dionne's long-term boyfriend\n*[[Breckin Meyer]] as Travis Birkenstock\n*[[Jeremy Sisto]] as Elton Tiscia\n*[[Nicole Bilderback]] as Summer Han\n*Sean Holland as Lawrence\n{{Div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nAccording to the special feature titled \"''Creative Writing''\", Heckerling describes the origins of ''Clueless'' as follows:\n{{quote|I went to [[20th Century Fox]] and they said \"We want you to do something about teenagers.\" And I thought \"I'm so tired about doing stuff about teenagers.\" But they said, \"We want you to do something about the 'in' crowd.\" I thought \"I'll do it if I can make fun of them.\" So, we developed this script. It was a pilot for a TV show. And it was about this girl that was completely happy, no matter what happened. And I was really getting into that kind of character. But nothing happened with it. They passed on it, they didn't get it. And a number of things were sort of falling through. I was just getting very frustrated. So I switched agents and when I had my new agent, they said: \"What have you been working on?\" So I showed Ken Stovitz, one of the agents there, this pilot. And he said, \"This is too good for TV. You should make this into a feature.\"<ref name=\"Creative\">{{cite news|url=https://vimeo.com/343465997|title=''Clueless'' - Creative Writing|publisher=[[Paramount Home Entertainment]]}}</ref>}}\n\nShe follows up on the connections to the [[Jane Austen]] novel, ''[[Emma (novel)|Emma]]'':\n{{quote|I started to think, \"What's the larger context for that kind of a 'nothing can go wrong' 'always looks through rose colored glasses' kind of girl?\" And I remembered ''Emma'', which I'd read in college. So, I took it out and reread it, and I said: \"Unconsciously, I've been writing an Emma-like character.\" Because I've always loved it and part of it had sort of stored it away in my brain... So I really related to her and got into it. And the plot was so brilliantly laid out in ''Emma''. So I tried to take all the things that were in this sort of pretty 1800s world and see what would that be like if it was in [[Beverly Hills]].<ref name=\"Creative\" />}} \n\nAssociate producer [[Twink Caplan]] recalls what the proposed TV show's initial title:\n{{quote|''No Worries'' was the original television script that Amy wrote. Then, we went to ''I Was a Teenage Teenager'' because with every new draft that Amy writes, she picks a whole new title.<ref name=\"Creative\" />}}\n\nFox picked up the picture, but put the film in a [[Turnaround (filmmaking)|turnaround]]. The male studio heads wanted Heckerling to rewrite the script so that fewer women would feature. Six months later, the script made its way to producer [[Scott Rudin]]. Rudin like the script and it was the subject of a bidding war, with [[Paramount Pictures]] beating out the other studios. Heckerling was excited, as Paramount owned several major youth-centered channels, such as [[MTV]] and [[Nickelodeon]], which was suited to the film's target demographic.<ref name=\"Creative\" />\n\n===Filming===\n[[File:Westfield Fashion Square.JPG|Westfield Fashion Square|thumb|150px|The Westfield Fashion Square]]\nPrincipal photography for the film took place between November 21 and December 31, 1994.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Alicia Silverstone Stars in 'Clueless,' A Romantic Comedy Written and Directed by Amy Heckelilng|url = http://www.thefreelibrary.com/ALICIA+SILVERSTONE+STARS+IN+'CLUELESS,'+A+ROMANTIC+COMEDY+WRITTEN+AND...-a015982332|website = thefreelibrary.com|access-date = 2016-02-05}}</ref> The film had a 40-day filming schedule. Producers sat in on classes at [[Beverly Hills High School]] to get a feel for the student culture.

This is first seen within the first fifteen minutes of the film when both she and Dionne pair their English teacher with the school's Debate teacher. However, this is more prominently reflected when Cher does everything in her power to pair her newest friend Tai. While both Emma and Cher mean well in their matchmaking attempts, neither of them realizes the depths of their actions nor their feelings towards Josh/Mr. Knightly until Tai/Harriet asks her to set her up with Josh/Mr. Knightley.\n\n'''Josh/Mr. Knightley''' \u2013 Cher's stepbrother, who she finds utterly repulsive. She states at the beginning of the movie that she has no positive feelings towards Josh in the slightest. The two bicker on a near constant basis. However, as the movie progresses, Josh is shown to be more caring and considerate towards Cher, becoming defensive towards her choices of men and life choices. It is not until the end of the movie it is revealed that Josh is in love with Cher and the two share a passionate kiss. \n\n'''Miss Geist/Miss Taylor/Mrs. Weston''' \u2013 Target of Cher's matchmaking.\n\n'''Tai/Harriet Smith''' \u2013 Tai, representative of the young, fair, and socially awkward Harriet Smith, is a newcomer to Bronson Alcott High School. Soon after, she is swept off her feet by both Cher and Dionne as they help her (unintentionally) become the most popular girl in school, much to Cher's jealousy. At the beginning of the film, Tai is attracted to Travis, a well-meaning, skateboard riding, pot smoker social recluse though is encouraged by Cher to strive for someone more socially well off, as Travis is not considered to be a socially acceptable partner. Following this advice, Tai then falls for Josh, much to even more of Cher's Jealousy.\n\n'''Mel Horowitz/Mr. Henry Woodhouse''' \u2013 Just as in the book, Mr. Horowitz is a well known and respected man within his circle of friends, though there is one major difference between both characters: while Mr. Horowitz is shown to have little to no care for his health, Mr. Woodhouse is considered to be a [[valetudinarian]]. Both characters are shown to love their daughter greatly while not always being so forward in their affection.\n\n'''Travis/Robert Martin''' \u2013 A stoner and a skater who falls for Tai by the end of the film; however, their attempts at courtship are derailed for a time by Cher's attempts to set Tai up with Elton. Travis is an underachiever, constantly late for class and often receiving poor grades.\n\n'''Elton Tascia/Philip Elton''' \u2013 Elton is a popular student whom Cher attempts to fix up with Tai. As is the case with the Elton from the book, he is not interested in Tai/Harriet and mistakenly believes that Cher/Emma is interested in him.\n\n'''Christian/Frank Churchill''' \u2013 The initially appealing love interest of Cher with whom she convinces herself she must be in love (just like the Frank Churchill character in the book). In the book, Churchill is not available to Emma because he is already engaged; in the film, Christian is not available to Cher because he is gay. Both characters engage in surface-level flirting with the heroine and make her consider her own feelings.\n\n==Home media==\n''Clueless'' was released on [[VHS]] and [[LaserDisc]] on December 19, 1995 by [[Paramount Home Video]]. It was released on [[DVD-Video|DVD]] on October 19, 1999. The special features only included two [[Trailer (promotion)|theatrical trailers]].\n\nThe film was reissued in a special tenth-anniversary \"''Whatever!'' Edition\" DVD on August 30, 2005.
