It is a letter from [[Paul the Apostle]] to a number of [[Early Christian]] communities in [[Galatia]]. Scholars have suggested that this is either the Roman province of Galatia in southern [[Early centers of Christianity#Asia Minor|Anatolia]], or a large region defined by an ethnic group of Celtic people in central Anatolia.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite encyclopedia|url = |title = Galatians, Epistle to the|last = Betz|first = H.

Paul argues that the gentile Galatians do not need to adhere to the tenets of the Mosaic Law, particularly [[religious male circumcision]], by contextualizing the role of the law in light of the revelation of Christ. The Epistle to the Galatians has exerted enormous influence on the history of Christianity, the development of Christian theology, and the study of the Apostle Paul.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Galatians Through the Centuries|last = Riches|first = John|publisher = Wiley-Blackwell|year = 2007|isbn = 978-0631230847|location = |pages = }}</ref>\n\nThe central dispute in the letter concerns the question of how Gentiles could convert to Christianity, which shows that this letter was written at a very early stage in church history, when the vast majority of Christians were Jewish or Jewish [[proselytes]], which historians refer to as the [[Jewish Christians]]. Another indicator that the letter is early is that there is no hint in the letter of a developed organization within the Christian community at large. This puts it during the lifetime of Paul himself.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n==Background ==\n<!--The following information comes from a paragraph in Ehrman's book, cited in the reference note-->\nNo original of the letter is known to survive.

The main arguments in favor of the authenticity of Galatians include its style and themes, which are common to the core letters of the Pauline corpus. George S.

He writes, \"did Paul's argument in Galatians flow out of the Jerusalem Council's decision, or did it come before the Jerusalem Council and possibly help shape that very decision?\"<ref>{{Cite book|last1=Jordan|first1=Jon R.|title=From Law to Logos : reading St. Paul's Epistle to the Galatians|date=2016|publisher=Wipf & Stock|others=Still, Todd D.|isbn=978-1-4982-8971-9|location=Eugene, Oregon|oclc=975120128}}</ref>\n\n=== Audience ===\nPaul's letter is addressed \"to the churches of Galatia\" ({{bibleref|Galatians|1:2|9}}), but the location of these churches is a matter of debate. A minority of scholars have argued that the \"Galatia\" is an ethnic reference to a [[Celt]]ic people living in northern [[Asia Minor]], but most agree that it is a geographical reference to the Roman province in central Asia Minor, which had been settled by immigrant Celts in the 270s BC and retained Gaulish features of culture and language in Paul's day. [[Acts of the Apostles]] records Paul traveling to the \"region of Galatia and [[Phrygia]]\", which lies immediately west of Galatia.<ref>{{bibleref|Acts|16:6}} and {{bibleref|Acts|18:23}}</ref>\n\nSome{{who|date=October 2013}} claim the New Testament says that the churches of Galatia ([[Antioch of Pisidia]], [[Iconium]], [[Lystra]] and [[Derbe]]) were founded by Paul himself ({{bibleref|Acts|16:6|9}}; {{bibleref2|Galatians.1:6; 4:13; 4:19||9}}). They seem to have been composed mainly of gentile converts ({{bibleref|Galatians|4:8|9}}). After Paul's departure, the churches were led astray from Paul's trust/faith-centered teachings by individuals proposing \"another gospel\" (which centered on salvation through the [[Mosaic law]], so-called [[Legalism (theology)|legalism]]), whom Paul saw as preaching a \"different gospel\" from what Paul had taught ({{bibleref2|Galatians|1:6\u20139|9|Galatians 1:1\u20139}}). The Galatians appear to have been receptive to the teaching of these newcomers, and the epistle is Paul's response to what he sees as their willingness to turn from his teaching.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThe identity of these \"opponents\" is disputed. However, the majority of modern scholars view them as Jewish Christians, who taught that in order for converts to belong to the [[People of God]], they must be subject to some or all of the Jewish Law, (i.e. [[Judaizer]]s). The letter indicates controversy concerning [[Circumcision controversy in early Christianity|circumcision]], [[Biblical Sabbath|Sabbath observance]], and the [[Biblical law in Christianity|Mosaic Covenant]]. It would appear, from Paul's response, that they cited the example of [[Abraham]], who was [[Religious male circumcision|circumcised]] as a mark of receiving the [[Covenant (biblical)#Abrahamic covenant|covenant blessings]] ({{bibleref|Genesis|17|9}}). They certainly appear to have questioned Paul's authority as an [[Twelve apostles|apostle]], perhaps appealing to the greater authority of the [[Early centers of Christianity#Jerusalem|Jerusalem church]] governed by [[James (brother of Jesus)]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n====North Galatian view====\nThe North Galatian view holds that the epistle was written very soon after Paul's second visit to Galatia ({{bibleref|Acts|18:23|9}}). In this view, the visit to [[Jerusalem]], mentioned in {{bibleref2|Galatians|2:1\u201310|9|Galatians 2:1\u201310}}, is identical with that of Acts 15, which is spoken of as a thing of the past. Consequently, the epistle seems to have been written after the [[Council of Jerusalem]]. The similarity between this epistle and the epistle to the Romans has led to the conclusion that they were both written at roughly the same time, during Paul's stay in [[Macedonia (Roman province)|Macedonia]] in roughly 56\u201357.<ref name=\"evans\">{{cite book|last=McDonald|first=Lee Martin|chapter-url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=oP3k4TNiDWMC&pg=PA462|title=The Bible Knowledge Background Commentary: Acts\u2013Philemon, Volume 2|date=2004|publisher=Victor|isbn=978-0781440066|editor-last=Evans|editor-first=Craig|location=Colorado Springs, CO|page=462|chapter=Introduction to Galatians}}</ref><ref>{{bibleref2|Acts|20:2\u20133|9|Acts 20:2\u20133}}</ref>\n\nThis third date takes the word \"quickly\" in Gal. 1:6 literally.<ref name=\"evans\" /> [[John P.

This theory holds that the epistle was written before the Council was convened, possibly making it the earliest of Paul's epistles. According to this theory, the revelation mentioned (Gal 2:2) corresponds with the prophecy of Agabus (Acts 11:27\u201328). This view holds that the private speaking about the gospel shared among the Gentiles precludes the Acts 15 visit, but fits perfectly with [[Acts 11]]. It further holds that continuing to remember the poor (Gal. 2:10) fits with the purpose of the Acts 11 visit, but not Acts 15.<ref name=\"Fung\">{{cite book|last=Fung|first=Ronald Y.

K. Fung}}</ref>\n\nIn addition, the exclusion of any mention of the letter of [[Acts 15]] is seen to indicate that such a letter did not yet exist, since Paul would have been likely to use it against the legalism confronted in Galatians. Finally, this view doubts Paul's confrontation of Peter (Gal. 2:11) would have been necessary after the events described in Acts 15. If this view is correct, the epistle should be dated somewhere around 47, depending on other difficult to date events, such as Paul's conversion.<ref name=\"Fung\" />\n\n[[Kirsopp Lake]] found this view less likely and wondered why it would be necessary for the Jerusalem Council (Acts 15) to take place at all if the issue were settled in Acts 11:30/12:25, as this view holds.<ref>{{cite book|last=Lake|first=Kirsopp|chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/thebeginningsofc05unknuoft/page/200|title=The Beginnings of Christianity, Volume 5|date=1933|publisher=Macmillan|editor1-last=Foakes Jackson|editor1-first=F.

Fung holds, then, that Paul's apostolic mission began almost immediately in Damascus (Acts 9:20). While accepting that Paul's apostolic anointing was likely only recognized by the Apostles in Jerusalem during the events described in [[Galatians 2]]/Acts 11:30, Fung does not see this as a problem for this theory.<ref name=\"Fung\" />\n\n=== Paul's opponents ===\nScholars have debated whether we can or should attempt to reconstruct both the backgrounds and arguments of the opponents to which Paul would have been responding.

This is the most extended discussion of Paul's past that we find in the Pauline letters (cf.

Paul engages in an exegetical argument, drawing upon the figure of [[Abraham]] and the priority of his faith to the covenant of circumcision. Paul explains that the law was introduced as a temporary measure, one that is no longer efficacious now that the seed of Abraham, Christ, has come. Chapter 4 then concludes with a summary of the topics discussed and with the benediction, followed by {{bibleref2|Galatians|5:1\u20136:10|9|5:1\u20136:10}} teaching about the right use of their Christian freedom.\n\nIn the conclusion of the epistle, Paul wrote, \"See with what large letters I am writing to you with my own hand.\" (Galatians 6:11, [[English Standard Version|ESV]]) Regarding this conclusion, [[Joseph Barber Lightfoot|Lightfoot]], in his Commentary on the epistle, says:\n\n<blockquote>\"At this point the apostle takes the pen from his [[amanuensis]], and the concluding paragraph is written with his own hand. From the time when letters began to be forged in his name ({{bibleref2|2Thessalonians|2:2|9}}; {{bibleref|2Thessalonians|3:17|9}}) it seems to have been his practice to close with a few words in his own handwriting, as a precaution against such forgeries...

Other commentators have attributed Paul's large letters to his poor education, his attempt to assert his authority, or his effort to emphasize his final words. Classics scholar Steve Reece has compared similar autographic subscriptions in thousands of Greek, Roman, and Jewish letters of this period and observes that large letters are a normal feature when senders of letters, regardless of their education, take the pen from their amanuensis and add a few words of greeting in their own hands.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://www.academia.edu/30640330 |last=Reece |first=Steve |title= Paul's Large Letters: Paul's Autographic Subscription in the Light of Ancient Epistolary Conventions |publisher=T&T Clark |year=2017 |isbn=9780567669063}}</ref>\n\nGalatians also contains a catalogue of [[vice]]s and [[virtue]]s, a popular formulation of ancient [[Christian ethics]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=zohGqVoPG7sC&pg=PA181 |title=The Reverse of the Curse: Paul, Wisdom, and the Law|last=Pate|first=C.

Nicole Chibici-Revneanu noticed a difference in Paul's treatment of the Law in Galatians and Romans. In Galatians the law is described as the \"oppressor\" whereas in Romans Paul describes that the Law was as being just as much in need of the Spirit to set it free from sin as humans do. Peter Oakes argues that Galatians simply cannot be construed as depicting the law positively because the Law played the role it was meant to play in the scope of human history.

Judith Gundry-Volf argues for a more general approach, stating that one's gender does not provide any benefit or burden. Pamela Eisenbaum argues that Paul was exhorting his readers to be mindful in changing conduct in relationships that involved people of different status. Ben Witherington argues that Paul is combatting the position espoused by opponents who were attempting influence Paul's community to return to the patriarchal standards held by the majority culture.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Tolmie|first=DF|date=2014-07-02|title=Tendencies in the interpretation of Galatians 3:28 since 1990|journal=Acta Theologica|volume=33|issue=2|pages=108\u2013109|doi=10.4314/actat.v33i2s.6|issn=1015-8758}}</ref> \n\nThere are two different interpretations within the modern scholarship regarding the meaning and function of Paul's statement that \"there is no longer male and female.\" The first interpretation states that Paul's words eliminate the biological differences between males and females and thus calls gender roles into question. Nancy Bedford says that this does not mean that there is no distinction between males and females; instead, it means that there is no room for gender hierarchy in the gospel.<ref name=\":7\">{{Cite book|last=Bedford, Nancy Elizabeth, author.|title=Galatians|publisher=|year=2016|isbn=978-0-664-23271-9|location=|pages=101\u2013102|oclc=937059676}}</ref> The second interpretation states that one must recognize the historical background of Paul's time. Jeremy Prunt argues that although many scholars want to say that this verse signifies changing gender norms, it actually reflects on the patriarchal structure of Paul's time. In Paul's time, females and males were considered one sex, and the female was understood to be the inferior version of the male. It is under this one sex understanding that Paul says that \"there is no longer male and female,\" and it therefore does not show an abolishment of the boundary between genders because that boundary did not exist in Paul's time.<ref name=\"PostColonial\">{{Cite journal|last=Punt|first=Jeremy|date=2010|title=Power and Liminality, Sex and Gender, and Gal 3:28: A Postcolonial, Queer Reading of an Influential Text|url=|journal=Neotestamentica|volume=44|issue=1|pages=161\u2013162|via=}}</ref> At the same time, the women in Paul's time would also not necessarily have heard an ideology of gender equality from the message of Galatians 3:28 because of their subordinated status in society at that time.<ref name=\"PostColonial\" /> Prunt argues that in Galatians 3:28, Paul's intention was to fixing social conflicts rather than to alter gender norms. By stating the importance of becoming one in Christ, Paul tries to give his society a new identity, which is the identity in Christ, and he believes that this will fix the social conflicts.<ref name=\"PostColonial\" />\n\n=== Meaning of \"Israel of God\" ===\nMany scholars debate the meaning of the phrase \"Israel of God\" in Galatians 6:6, wherein Paul wishes for \"peace and mercy\" to be \"even upon the Israel of God.\" <ref>{{Cite book|last=Schreiner, Thomas R.|title=Galatians|date=2010|publisher=Zondervan|isbn=978-0-310-24372-4|location=Grand Rapids, Mich.|pages=381|oclc=613993871}}</ref> As Schreiner reveals, scholars debate over whether \"Israel of God\" refers to ethnically Jewish believers \"within the church of Jesus Christ,\" or to the church of Christ as a whole (Jewish and Gentiles all included).<ref>{{Cite book|last=Schreiner, Thomas R.|title=Galatians|date=2010|publisher=Zondervan|isbn=978-0-310-24372-4|location=Grand Rapids, Mich.|pages=381|oclc=613993871}}</ref> Those who believe that \"Israel of God\" only refers to ethnically Jewish believers, argue that had Paul meant the entire church, he would use the word \"mercy\" before \"peace,\" because Paul \"sees peace as the petition for the church, while mercy is the request for unredeemed Jews.\"<ref>{{Cite book|last=Richardson|first=Peter|title=Israel in the Apostolic Church|publisher=Cambridge: Cambridge University Press|year=1969|isbn=|location=|pages=76\u201380}}</ref> <ref>{{Cite book|last=Burton|first=Ernest De Witt|title=A Critical and Exegetical Commentary on the Epistle to the Galatians|publisher=Scribner's|year=1920|isbn=|location=|pages=358}}</ref> Contrastingly, other scholars such as G.K.

Masaki claims \"At the heart of Luther's Lectures on Galatians is the doctrine of the proper distinction between law and gospel. While Luther's contemporary opponents failed to see this\u2014whether they were the papists, enthusiasts, Anabaptists, Sacramentarians, or antinomians\u2014law/gospel articulation defined Luther's legacy in the thinking of his colleagues, students, and generations after him. <ref>{{Cite journal|last=Masaki|first=Naomichi|date=July 2017|title=In Search of Celebrating the Reformation Rightly: Luther's Lectures on Galatians (1531/1535) as the Banner of the Reformation|url=|journal=Concordia Theological Quarterly (July 2017)|volume=81|issue=3\u20134|pages=222|via=}}</ref> \"This distinction of law and gospel has been imperative to Luther's understanding of Paul's Judaism as well, but modern scholarship has formed a new perspective of the Judaism of Paul's time. \"Luther's treatment of Galatians has affected most interpretations of the letter, at least among Protestants, up to the present time\u2026Problems with Luther's interpretations and perspectives have become evident in modern times, particularly in his understanding and treatment of Judaism in Paul's day.\" <ref>{{Cite journal|last=Haltgren|first=Arland|date=Summer 2000|title=Luther on Galatians|url=|journal=Word and World|volume=20|issue=3|pages=237\u2013238|via=}}</ref>\n\nThis development led to some schools of thought, such as Canadian religious historian [[Barrie Wilson]] who points out in ''[[How Jesus Became Christian]]'',<ref>{{cite book|last=Wilson|first=Barrie|url=https://archive.org/details/howjesusbecamech00barr|title=How Jesus Became Christian|date=2008|publisher=St. Martin's Press|location=New York|url-access=registration}}</ref> how Paul's Letter to the Galatians represents a sweeping rejection of Jewish Law (Torah). In so doing, Paul clearly takes his Christ movement out of the orbit of Judaism and into an entirely different milieu. Paul's stance constitutes a major contrast to the position of [[James, brother of Jesus]], whose group in Jerusalem adhered to the observance of Torah. \n\n=== Gender, Sexuality, and Modern Scholarship ===\nGalatians 3:28 is one of the most controversial and influential verses in Galatians. There are three different pairs that Paul uses to elaborate his ideology. The first one is \"Jew or Greek,\" the second one is \"slave or free,\" and the third one is \"male and female.\"<ref name=\":7\" /> Paul seems to imply that in Jesus Christ there is no longer a distinction between them. However, the real meaning this verse is never united. In modern politics, the debate about the meaning of Galatians 3:28 is significant, as it is used by different people and scholars in order to make normative claims about sexuality, gender, and even marriage.<ref name=\":6\" /> The ongoing nature of this debate reveals that scholars still have not come to unified conclusion regarding Paul's theology. It also reflects the way in which this verse has been used to suit the purposes of the interpreter. \n\n==See also==\n* [[Paul the Apostle and Judaism]]\n* [[Prayer of St. John Gabriel Perboyre to Jesus]]\n* [[Textual variants in the New Testament#Epistle to the Galatians|Textual variants in the Epistle to the Galatians]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n* {{EBD|Galatians, Epistle to the}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wikisource|Galatians (Bible)|Galatians}}\n{{wikiquote}}\nOnline translations of the Epistle to Galatians:\n* [http://www.biblegateway.com ''Bible Gateway 35 languages/50 versions'' at GospelCom.net]\n* [http://unbound.biola.edu ''Unbound Bible 100+ languages/versions'' at Biola University]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20111018145558/http://bible.daresler.net/Galatians-1/ Galatians \u2013 King James Bible]\n* [http://www.gospelhall.org/bible/bible.php?passage=Galatians+1 ''Online Bible'' at GospelHall.org]\n* {{librivox book | title=Galatians}} Various versions\n\nRelated articles:\n* [http://www.vts.edu/ftpimages/95/download/download_group10628_id314970.pdf A Brief Introduction to Galatians]\n* [http://www.galatians-paul-the-torah-law-legalism.info Galatians, Paul, The Torah-Law & Legalism]\n* [http://www.fourthcentury.com/index.php/john-chrysostom-on-galatians John Chrysostom's Commentary on Galatians]\n* [http://www.eliyah.com/galatians.html An alternative commentary on Galatians]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20090112221356/http://www.galloturca.com/galatians.htm A Secular Site on Galatians]\n* [http://store.netivyah.org/samples/galatians.pdf Jewish messianic Commentary on Galatians (Jerusalem)]{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}\n* {{EB1911|noprescript=1|wstitle=Galatians, Epistle to the}}\n\n{{S-start}}\n{{S-hou|[[Pauline epistles|Pauline]] [[Epistles|Epistle]]|||}}\n{{S-bef|before=[[Second Epistle to the Corinthians|Second Corinthians]]}}\n{{S-ttl|title=<small>[[New Testament]]</small><br>[[Books of the Bible]]}}\n{{S-aft|after=[[Epistle to the Ephesians|Ephesians]]}}\n{{S-end}}\n\n{{Epistle to the Galatians}}\n{{Books of the Bible}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Epistle to the Galatians}}\n[[Category:1st-century Christian texts]]\n[[Category:Epistle to the Galatians| ]]\n[[Category:Canonical epistles|Galatians]]\n[[Category:New Testament books|Galatians]]\n", "text_old": "{{Paul}}{{Books of the New Testament}}\n{{dispute about|a massive set of edits made by [[WP:SPA]]s and almost no edit summaries on 4 March 2020; needs checking or reverting|Class project?|date=March 2020}}\nThe '''Epistle to the Galatians''', often shortened to '''Galatians''', is the ninth book of the [[New Testament]]. It is a letter from [[Paul the Apostle]] to a number of [[Early Christian]] communities in [[Galatia]].

Paul argues that the gentile Galatians do not need to adhere to the tenets of the Mosaic Law, particularly [[religious male circumcision]], by contextualizing the role of the law in light of the revelation of Christ.

Another indicator that the letter is early is that there is no hint in the letter of a developed organization within the Christian community at large.

The main arguments in favor of the authenticity of Galatians include its style and themes, which are common to the core letters of the Pauline corpus. George S.

He writes, \"did Paul's argument in Galatians flow out of the Jerusalem Council's decision, or did it come before the Jerusalem Council and possibly help shape that very decision?\"<ref>{{Cite book|last1=Jordan|first1=Jon R.|title=From Law to Logos : reading St. Paul's Epistle to the Galatians|date=2016|publisher=Wipf & Stock|others=Still, Todd D.|isbn=978-1-4982-8971-9|location=Eugene, Oregon|oclc=975120128}}</ref>\n\n=== Audience ===\nPaul's letter is addressed \"to the churches of Galatia\" ({{bibleref|Galatians|1:2|9}}), but the location of these churches is a matter of debate. A minority of scholars have argued that the \"Galatia\" is an ethnic reference to a [[Celt]]ic people living in northern [[Asia Minor]], but most agree that it is a geographical reference to the Roman province in central Asia Minor, which had been settled by immigrant Celts in the 270s BC and retained Gaulish features of culture and language in Paul's day. [[Acts of the Apostles]] records Paul traveling to the \"region of Galatia and [[Phrygia]]\", which lies immediately west of Galatia.<ref>{{bibleref|Acts|16:6}} and {{bibleref|Acts|18:23}}</ref>\n\nSome{{who|date=October 2013}} claim the New Testament says that the churches of Galatia ([[Antioch of Pisidia]], [[Iconium]], [[Lystra]] and [[Derbe]]) were founded by Paul himself ({{bibleref|Acts|16:6|9}}; {{bibleref2|Galatians.1:6; 4:13; 4:19||9}}). They seem to have been composed mainly of gentile converts ({{bibleref|Galatians|4:8|9}}). After Paul's departure, the churches were led astray from Paul's trust/faith-centered teachings by individuals proposing \"another gospel\" (which centered on salvation through the [[Mosaic law]], so-called [[Legalism (theology)|legalism]]), whom Paul saw as preaching a \"different gospel\" from what Paul had taught ({{bibleref2|Galatians|1:6\u20139|9|Galatians 1:1\u20139}}). The Galatians appear to have been receptive to the teaching of these newcomers, and the epistle is Paul's response to what he sees as their willingness to turn from his teaching.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThe identity of these \"opponents\" is disputed. However, the majority of modern scholars view them as Jewish Christians, who taught that in order for converts to belong to the [[People of God]], they must be subject to some or all of the Jewish Law, (i.e. [[Judaizer]]s). The letter indicates controversy concerning [[Circumcision controversy in early Christianity|circumcision]], [[Biblical Sabbath|Sabbath observance]], and the [[Biblical law in Christianity|Mosaic Covenant]]. It would appear, from Paul's response, that they cited the example of [[Abraham]], who was [[Religious male circumcision|circumcised]] as a mark of receiving the [[Covenant (biblical)#Abrahamic covenant|covenant blessings]] ({{bibleref|Genesis|17|9}}). They certainly appear to have questioned Paul's authority as an [[Twelve apostles|apostle]], perhaps appealing to the greater authority of the [[Early centers of Christianity#Jerusalem|Jerusalem church]] governed by [[James (brother of Jesus)]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n====North Galatian view====\nThe North Galatian view holds that the epistle was written very soon after Paul's second visit to Galatia ({{bibleref|Acts|18:23|9}}). In this view, the visit to [[Jerusalem]], mentioned in {{bibleref2|Galatians|2:1\u201310|9|Galatians 2:1\u201310}}, is identical with that of Acts 15, which is spoken of as a thing of the past. Consequently, the epistle seems to have been written after the [[Council of Jerusalem]]. The similarity between this epistle and the epistle to the Romans has led to the conclusion that they were both written at roughly the same time, during Paul's stay in [[Macedonia (Roman province)|Macedonia]] in roughly 56\u201357.<ref name=\"evans\">{{cite book|last=McDonald|first=Lee Martin|chapter-url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=oP3k4TNiDWMC&pg=PA462|title=The Bible Knowledge Background Commentary: Acts\u2013Philemon, Volume 2|date=2004|publisher=Victor|isbn=978-0781440066|editor-last=Evans|editor-first=Craig|location=Colorado Springs, CO|page=462|chapter=Introduction to Galatians}}</ref><ref>{{bibleref2|Acts|20:2\u20133|9|Acts 20:2\u20133}}</ref>\n\nThis third date takes the word \"quickly\" in Gal. 1:6 literally.<ref name=\"evans\" /> [[John P.

This theory holds that the epistle was written before the Council was convened, possibly making it the earliest of Paul's epistles. According to this theory, the revelation mentioned (Gal 2:2) corresponds with the prophecy of Agabus (Acts 11:27\u201328). This view holds that the private speaking about the gospel shared among the Gentiles precludes the Acts 15 visit, but fits perfectly with [[Acts 11]]. It further holds that continuing to remember the poor (Gal. 2:10) fits with the purpose of the Acts 11 visit, but not Acts 15.<ref name=\"Fung\">{{cite book|last=Fung|first=Ronald Y.

K. Fung}}</ref>\n\nIn addition, the exclusion of any mention of the letter of [[Acts 15]] is seen to indicate that such a letter did not yet exist, since Paul would have been likely to use it against the legalism confronted in Galatians. Finally, this view doubts Paul's confrontation of Peter (Gal. 2:11) would have been necessary after the events described in Acts 15. If this view is correct, the epistle should be dated somewhere around 47, depending on other difficult to date events, such as Paul's conversion.<ref name=\"Fung\" />\n\n[[Kirsopp Lake]] found this view less likely and wondered why it would be necessary for the Jerusalem Council (Acts 15) to take place at all if the issue were settled in Acts 11:30/12:25, as this view holds.<ref>{{cite book|last=Lake|first=Kirsopp|chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/thebeginningsofc05unknuoft/page/200|title=The Beginnings of Christianity, Volume 5|date=1933|publisher=Macmillan|editor1-last=Foakes Jackson|editor1-first=F.

Fung holds, then, that Paul's apostolic mission began almost immediately in Damascus (Acts 9:20). While accepting that Paul's apostolic anointing was likely only recognized by the Apostles in Jerusalem during the events described in [[Galatians 2]]/Acts 11:30, Fung does not see this as a problem for this theory.<ref name=\"Fung\" />\n\n=== Paul's opponents ===\nScholars have debated whether we can or should attempt to reconstruct both the backgrounds and arguments of the opponents to which Paul would have been responding.

While many scholars have claimed that Paul's opponents were circumcisionist Jewish followers of Jesus, the ability to make such determinations with a reasonable degree of certainty has been called into question.<ref name=\":6\" /> It has often been presumed that they traveled from Jerusalem, but some commentators have raised the question of whether they may have actually been insiders familiar with the dynamics of the community.

This does not result in a coherent argument nor can it possibly reflect the thought processes of his opponents accurately. It is nearly impossible to reconstruct the opponents from Paul's text because their representation is necessarily polemical.

After an introductory address ({{bibleref|Galatians|1:1\u201310|9}}), the apostle discusses the subjects which had occasioned the epistle.\n\nIn the first two chapters, Paul discusses his life before Christ and his early ministry, including interactions with other apostles in Jerusalem. This is the most extended discussion of Paul's past that we find in the Pauline letters (cf. [[Epistle to the Philippians|Philippians]] 3:1\u20137).<ref>{{Cite encyclopedia|url = |title = Paul|last = Betz|first = H.

Paul engages in an exegetical argument, drawing upon the figure of [[Abraham]] and the priority of his faith to the covenant of circumcision. Paul explains that the law was introduced as a temporary measure, one that is no longer efficacious now that the seed of Abraham, Christ, has come. Chapter 4 then concludes with a summary of the topics discussed and with the benediction, followed by {{bibleref2|Galatians|5:1\u20136:10|9|5:1\u20136:10}} teaching about the right use of their Christian freedom.\n\nIn the conclusion of the epistle, Paul wrote, \"See with what large letters I am writing to you with my own hand.\" (Galatians 6:11, [[English Standard Version|ESV]]) Regarding this conclusion, [[Joseph Barber Lightfoot|Lightfoot]], in his Commentary on the epistle, says:\n\n<blockquote>\"At this point the apostle takes the pen from his [[amanuensis]], and the concluding paragraph is written with his own hand. From the time when letters began to be forged in his name ({{bibleref2|2Thessalonians|2:2|9}}; {{bibleref|2Thessalonians|3:17|9}}) it seems to have been his practice to close with a few words in his own handwriting, as a precaution against such forgeries... In the present case he writes a whole paragraph, summing up the main lessons of the epistle in terse, eager, disjointed sentences. He writes it, too, in large, bold characters (Gr.

Other commentators have attributed Paul's large letters to his poor education, his attempt to assert his authority, or his effort to emphasize his final words. Classics scholar Steve Reece has compared similar autographic subscriptions in thousands of Greek, Roman, and Jewish letters of this period and observes that large letters are a normal feature when senders of letters, regardless of their education, take the pen from their amanuensis and add a few words of greeting in their own hands.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://www.academia.edu/30640330 |last=Reece |first=Steve |title= Paul's Large Letters: Paul's Autographic Subscription in the Light of Ancient Epistolary Conventions |publisher=T&T Clark |year=2017 |isbn=9780567669063}}</ref>\n\nGalatians also contains a catalogue of [[vice]]s and [[virtue]]s, a popular formulation of ancient [[Christian ethics]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=zohGqVoPG7sC&pg=PA181 |title=The Reverse of the Curse: Paul, Wisdom, and the Law|last=Pate|first=C.

Position (2) reminds its critics that the \"whole letter context\" is very much about how people got on in the here and now together, and in fact the discussion about justification came out of an actual example of people treating other people differently (2:11ff).<ref name=\"rei\"/>\n\n==Major Issues==\n\n=== Paul and the Law ===\nMuch variety exists in discussions of Paul's view of the Law in Galatians. Nicole Chibici-Revneanu noticed a difference in Paul's treatment of the Law in Galatians and Romans. In Galatians the law is described as the \"oppressor\" whereas in Romans Paul describes that the Law was as being just as much in need of the Spirit to set it free from sin as humans do. Peter Oakes argues that Galatians simply cannot be construed as depicting the law positively because the Law played the role it was meant to play in the scope of human history. Wolfgang Reinbold argues that, contrary to the popular reading of Paul, that the Law was possible to keep.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|last=Tolmie|first=Francois D.|date=July 12, 2012|title=Research on the Letter to the Galatians 2000-2010|url=|journal=Acta Theologica 32|volume=|pages=136|via=}}</ref> \n\n=== Under Law & Works of Law ===\nRegarding \"under the law\" (Gal. 3:23; 4:4, 5, 21; 5:18), Todd Wilson argues that \"under the law\" in Galatians was a \"rhetorical abbreviation for \u2018under the curse of the law.'\"<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Wilson|first=Todd A.|date=2005-10-01|title='Under Law' in Galatians: A Pauline Theological Abbreviation|journal=The Journal of Theological Studies|volume=56|issue=2|pages=362\u2013392|doi=10.1093/jts/fli108|issn=1477-4607}}</ref> Regarding \"works of the law\" (Gal. 2:16), Robert Keith Rapa argues Paul is speaking of viewing Torah-observances as the means of salvation which he is seeking to combat in the Galatian congregation. Jacqueline de Roo noticed a similar phrase in the works found at Qumran and argues that \"works of the law\" is speaking of obedience to the Torah acting as a way of being atoned for. Michael Bachmann argues that this phrase is a mention of certain actions taken by Jewish people to distinguish themselves and perpetuate separation between themselves and gentiles.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n=== Law of Christ ===\nMuch debate surrounds what Paul means by \"law of Christ\" in Galatians 6:2, a phrase that occurs only once in all of Paul's letters.<ref name=\"Unwritten\">{{Cite journal|last=Murphy-O'Connor|first=Jerome|date=April 2, 2012|title=The Unwritten Law of Christ (Gal 6:2)|url=|journal=Revue Biblique|volume=119|pages=213|via=}}</ref> As Schreiner explains, some scholars think that the \"law of Christ\" is the sum of Jesus's words, functioning as a \"new Torah for believers.\"<ref>{{Cite book|last=Schreiner, Thomas R.|title=Galatians|date=2010|publisher=Zondervan|isbn=978-0-310-24372-4|location=Grand Rapids, Mich.|pages=359|oclc=613993871}}</ref> Others argue that the \"genitive in the \u2018law of Christ'\u2026should be understood as explanatory, i.e. the law which is Christ.'\"<ref name=\"Unwritten\" /> Some focus on the relationship between the law of Christ and the Old Testament Decalogue.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Meilaender|first=Glibert|title=The Decalogue as the Law of Christ|url=|journal=Pro Ecclesia|volume=27|issue=3|pages=338\u201349|doi=10.1177/106385121802700312|year=2018}}</ref> Still other scholars argue that whereas the \"Mosaic law is abolished,\" the new \"law of Christ fits with the Zion Torah,\" which \"hails from Zion\u2026and is eschatological.\"<ref>{{Cite book|last=Gese|first=Hartmut|title=Essays on Biblical Theology|publisher=|year=1981|isbn=|location=Minneapolis, Augsburg|pages=360}}</ref> Schreiner himself believes that the law of Christ is equivalent to Galatians 5:13-14's \"law of love.\"<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite book|last=Schreiner, Thomas R.|title=Galatians|date=2010|publisher=Zondervan|isbn=978-0-310-24372-4|location=Grand Rapids, Mich.|pages=360|oclc=613993871}}</ref> According to Schreiner, when believers love others, \"they behave as Christ did and fulfill his law.\"<ref name=\":5\" /> \n\n=== Antioch Incident ===\nAs Thomas Schreiner explains, there is significant debate over the meaning of Peter's eating with the Gentiles\u2014specifically, why might have the eating been considered wrong?<ref>{{Cite book|last=Schreiner, Thomas R.|title=Galatians|date=2010|publisher=Zondervan|isbn=978-0-310-24372-4|location=Grand Rapids, Mich.|pages=141|oclc=613993871}}</ref> E.P.

Judith Gundry-Volf argues for a more general approach, stating that one's gender does not provide any benefit or burden. Pamela Eisenbaum argues that Paul was exhorting his readers to be mindful in changing conduct in relationships that involved people of different status. Ben Witherington argues that Paul is combatting the position espoused by opponents who were attempting influence Paul's community to return to the patriarchal standards held by the majority culture.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Tolmie|first=DF|date=2014-07-02|title=Tendencies in the interpretation of Galatians 3:28 since 1990|journal=Acta Theologica|volume=33|issue=2|pages=108\u2013109|doi=10.4314/actat.v33i2s.6|issn=1015-8758}}</ref> \n\nThere are two different interpretations within the modern scholarship regarding the meaning and function of Paul's statement that \"there is no longer male and female.\" The first interpretation states that Paul's words eliminate the biological differences between males and females and thus calls gender roles into question. Nancy Bedford says that this does not mean that there is no distinction between males and females; instead, it means that there is no room for gender hierarchy in the gospel.<ref name=\":7\">{{Cite book|last=Bedford, Nancy Elizabeth, author.|title=Galatians|publisher=|year=2016|isbn=978-0-664-23271-9|location=|pages=101\u2013102|oclc=937059676}}</ref> The second interpretation states that one must recognize the historical background of Paul's time. Jeremy Prunt argues that although many scholars want to say that this verse signifies changing gender norms, it actually reflects on the patriarchal structure of Paul's time. In Paul's time, females and males were considered one sex, and the female was understood to be the inferior version of the male. It is under this one sex understanding that Paul says that \"there is no longer male and female,\" and it therefore does not show an abolishment of the boundary between genders because that boundary did not exist in Paul's time.<ref name=\"PostColonial\">{{Cite journal|last=Punt|first=Jeremy|date=2010|title=Power and Liminality, Sex and Gender, and Gal 3:28: A Postcolonial, Queer Reading of an Influential Text|url=|journal=Neotestamentica|volume=44|issue=1|pages=161\u2013162|via=}}</ref> At the same time, the women in Paul's time would also not necessarily have heard an ideology of gender equality from the message of Galatians 3:28 because of their subordinated status in society at that time.<ref name=\"PostColonial\" /> Prunt argues that in Galatians 3:28, Paul's intention was to fixing social conflicts rather than to alter gender norms. By stating the importance of becoming one in Christ, Paul tries to give his society a new identity, which is the identity in Christ, and he believes that this will fix the social conflicts.<ref name=\"PostColonial\" />\n\n=== Meaning of \"Israel of God\" ===\nMany scholars debate the meaning of the phrase \"Israel of God\" in Galatians 6:6, wherein Paul wishes for \"peace and mercy\" to be \"even upon the Israel of God.\" <ref>{{Cite book|last=Schreiner, Thomas R.|title=Galatians|date=2010|publisher=Zondervan|isbn=978-0-310-24372-4|location=Grand Rapids, Mich.|pages=381|oclc=613993871}}</ref> As Schreiner reveals, scholars debate over whether \"Israel of God\" refers to ethnically Jewish believers \"within the church of Jesus Christ,\" or to the church of Christ as a whole (Jewish and Gentiles all included).<ref>{{Cite book|last=Schreiner, Thomas R.|title=Galatians|date=2010|publisher=Zondervan|isbn=978-0-310-24372-4|location=Grand Rapids, Mich.|pages=381|oclc=613993871}}</ref> Those who believe that \"Israel of God\" only refers to ethnically Jewish believers, argue that had Paul meant the entire church, he would use the word \"mercy\" before \"peace,\" because Paul \"sees peace as the petition for the church, while mercy is the request for unredeemed Jews.\"<ref>{{Cite book|last=Richardson|first=Peter|title=Israel in the Apostolic Church|publisher=Cambridge: Cambridge University Press|year=1969|isbn=|location=|pages=76\u201380}}</ref> <ref>{{Cite book|last=Burton|first=Ernest De Witt|title=A Critical and Exegetical Commentary on the Epistle to the Galatians|publisher=Scribner's|year=1920|isbn=|location=|pages=358}}</ref> Contrastingly, other scholars such as G.K. Beale argue that the Old Testament backdrop of Galatians 6:16\u2014e.g. a verse such as Isaiah 54:10 wherein God promises mercy and peace to Israel\u2014suggests that \"the Israel of God\" refers to a portion of the new, eschatological Israel \"composed of Jews and Gentiles.\"<ref>{{Cite book|last=Beale|first=G.K.|title=Peace and Mercy Upon the Israel of God: The Old Testament Background of Galatians 6:16b|publisher=|year=1999|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref> Schreiner himself is sympathetic with this view, believing that treating the \"Israel of God\" as the church of Christ, fits with the whole of Galatians, since Galatians pronounces \"believers in Christ\" as \"the true sons of Abraham.\"<ref>{{Cite book|last=Schreiner, Thomas R.|title=Galatians|date=2010|publisher=Zondervan|isbn=978-0-310-24372-4|location=Grand Rapids, Mich.|pages=382|oclc=613993871}}</ref>\n\n==Significance and Reception History ==\n=== Luther's Theology and Antisemitism ===\nLuther's principle belief in justification by faith was formed in large part by his interpretation of Galatians. Masaki claims \"At the heart of Luther's Lectures on Galatians is the doctrine of the proper distinction between law and gospel. While Luther's contemporary opponents failed to see this\u2014whether they were the papists, enthusiasts, Anabaptists, Sacramentarians, or antinomians\u2014law/gospel articulation defined Luther's legacy in the thinking of his colleagues, students, and generations after him. <ref>{{Cite journal|last=Masaki|first=Naomichi|date=July 2017|title=In Search of Celebrating the Reformation Rightly: Luther's Lectures on Galatians (1531/1535) as the Banner of the Reformation|url=|journal=Concordia Theological Quarterly (July 2017)|volume=81|issue=3\u20134|pages=222|via=}}</ref> \"This distinction of law and gospel has been imperative to Luther's understanding of Paul's Judaism as well, but modern scholarship has formed a new perspective of the Judaism of Paul's time. \"Luther's treatment of Galatians has affected most interpretations of the letter, at least among Protestants, up to the present time\u2026Problems with Luther's interpretations and perspectives have become evident in modern times, particularly in his understanding and treatment of Judaism in Paul's day.\" <ref>{{Cite journal|last=Haltgren|first=Arland|date=Summer 2000|title=Luther on Galatians|url=|journal=Word and World|volume=20|issue=3|pages=237\u2013238|via=}}</ref>\n\nThis development led to some schools of thought, such as Canadian religious historian [[Barrie Wilson]] who points out in ''[[How Jesus Became Christian]]'',<ref>{{cite book|last=Wilson|first=Barrie|url=https://archive.org/details/howjesusbecamech00barr|title=How Jesus Became Christian|date=2008|publisher=St. Martin's Press|location=New York|url-access=registration}}</ref> how Paul's Letter to the Galatians represents a sweeping rejection of Jewish Law (Torah). In so doing, Paul clearly takes his Christ movement out of the orbit of Judaism and into an entirely different milieu. Paul's stance constitutes a major contrast to the position of [[James, brother of Jesus]], whose group in Jerusalem adhered to the observance of Torah. \n\n=== Gender, Sexuality, and Modern Scholarship ===\nGalatians 3:28 is one of the most controversial and influential verses in Galatians. There are three different pairs that Paul uses to elaborate his ideology. The first one is \"Jew or Greek,\" the second one is \"slave or free,\" and the third one is \"male and female.\"<ref name=\":7\" /> Paul seems to imply that in Jesus Christ there is no longer a distinction between them. However, the real meaning this verse is never united. In modern politics, the debate about the meaning of Galatians 3:28 is significant, as it is used by different people and scholars in order to make normative claims about sexuality, gender, and even marriage.<ref name=\":6\" /> The ongoing nature of this debate reveals that scholars still have not come to unified conclusion regarding Paul's theology.

The [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Department of Veterans Affairs]] (VA) began to provide disability benefits for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in the 1980s after the diagnosis had become part of official psychiatric [[nosology]]. \n\nLimited research suggests that VA disability benefits achieve their goal of helping veterans suffering from PTSD. The [[Veterans Benefits Administration]] (VBA), a component of the Department of Veterans Affairs, processes disability claims and administers all aspects of the VA disability program. Since 1988 VA disability claim decisions have been subject to federal court review. \n\n[[#Disability rating|Disability ratings]] theoretically represent a veteran's \"average impairment in earnings capacity\", on a scale from 0 to 100. Veterans who file a disability claim due to PTSD almost always receive a compensation and pension examination (C&P exam) by VA-employed or VA-contracted psychologists or psychiatrists. Social scientists and others have expressed concern about the consistency and accuracy of PTSD C&P exam findings, although the VA generally rejects such concerns as unfounded or exaggerated.\n\nRecent efforts to change VA disability benefits for PTSD include urging the VA to place more emphasis on [[vocational rehabilitation]] and treatment versus cash payments; revising the [[#General rating formula for mental disorders|General Rating Formula for Mental Disorders]] to better reflect problems experienced by veterans with PTSD; and considering a veteran's [[quality of life]] when determining the disability rating.\n{{TOC limit}}\n== VA disability benefits for PTSD ==\nThe United States provides a range of benefits for veterans with [[posttraumatic stress disorder|post-traumatic stress disorder]] (PTSD), which was incurred in, or aggravated by, their military service.<ref>{{Citation|title=Direct service connection; wartime and peacetime\u2014Posttraumatic stress disorder, 38 C.F.R. \u00a73.304(f)|publisher=eCFR\u2014Code of Federal Regulations|url=https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?mc=true&node=se38.1.3_1304&rgn=div8|language=en-US|access-date=October 2, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170710100715/https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=7223164a8b39947167da2b98f490afaa&mc=true&node=se38.1.3_1304&rgn=div8|archive-date=July 10, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> The [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs]] (VA) will provide benefits<ref>{{cite web|title=Federal Benefits for Veterans, Dependents and Survivors, 2017 Edition|url=http://www.va.gov/opa/publications/benefits_book.asp|publisher=Department of Veterans Affairs|access-date=June 24, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180606045117/https://www.va.gov/opa/publications/benefits_book.asp|archive-date=June 6, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> to veterans that the VA has determined suffer from PTSD, which developed during, or as a result of, their military service.

The longer he is unemployed, the more his confidence in his ability and motivation to work erodes and his skills atrophy.

What's more, compensation contingent upon being sick often creates a perverse incentive to remain sick.

The [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Department of Veterans Affairs]] (VA) began to provide disability benefits for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in the 1980s after the diagnosis had become part of official psychiatric [[nosology]]. \n\nLimited research suggests that VA disability benefits achieve their goal of helping veterans suffering from PTSD. The [[Veterans Benefits Administration]] (VBA), a component of the Department of Veterans Affairs, processes disability claims and administers all aspects of the VA disability program. Since 1988 VA disability claim decisions have been subject to federal court review. \n\n[[#Disability rating|Disability ratings]] theoretically represent a veteran's \"average impairment in earnings capacity\", on a scale from 0 to 100. Veterans who file a disability claim due to PTSD almost always receive a compensation and pension examination (C&P exam) by VA-employed or VA-contracted psychologists or psychiatrists. Social scientists and others have expressed concern about the consistency and accuracy of PTSD C&P exam findings, although the VA generally rejects such concerns as unfounded or exaggerated.\n\nRecent efforts to change VA disability benefits for PTSD include urging the VA to place more emphasis on [[vocational rehabilitation]] and treatment versus cash payments; revising the [[#General rating formula for mental disorders|General Rating Formula for Mental Disorders]] to better reflect problems experienced by veterans with PTSD; and considering a veteran's [[quality of life]] when determining the disability rating.\n{{TOC limit}}\n== VA disability benefits for PTSD ==\nThe United States provides a range of benefits for veterans with [[posttraumatic stress disorder|post-traumatic stress disorder]] (PTSD), which was incurred in, or aggravated by, their military service.<ref>{{Citation|title=Direct service connection; wartime and peacetime\u2014Posttraumatic stress disorder, 38 C.F.R. \u00a73.304(f)|publisher=eCFR\u2014Code of Federal Regulations|url=https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?mc=true&node=se38.1.3_1304&rgn=div8|language=en-US|access-date=October 2, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170710100715/https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=7223164a8b39947167da2b98f490afaa&mc=true&node=se38.1.3_1304&rgn=div8|archive-date=July 10, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> The [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs]] (VA) will provide benefits<ref>{{cite web|title=Federal Benefits for Veterans, Dependents and Survivors, 2017 Edition|url=http://www.va.gov/opa/publications/benefits_book.asp|publisher=Department of Veterans Affairs|access-date=June 24, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180606045117/https://www.va.gov/opa/publications/benefits_book.asp|archive-date=June 6, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> to veterans that the VA has determined suffer from PTSD, which developed during, or as a result of, their military service.

The longer he is unemployed, the more his confidence in his ability and motivation to work erodes and his skills atrophy. Once a patient is caught in such a downward spiral of invalidism, it can be hard to throttle back out. What's more, compensation contingent upon being sick often creates a perverse incentive to remain sick.

While the new system reduced paperwork and increased output, it limited the information that the VA's employees who determine compensation eligibility and dollar amounts\u2014called raters\u2014can consider, according to these employees. The result, raters contend: a more inaccurate process that approves higher levels of disability than veterans' military records, medical histories and other evidence might show\u2014in some cases increasing payments to veterans by thousands of dollars a month.

{"title_page": "Flora family", "text_new": "[[File:Flora family.png|thumb|upright=1.3|Location and structure of the Flora family within the [[asteroid belt]]]]\n\nThe '''Flora family''' (''adj. Florian''; {{small|[[Family identification number|FIN]]: [[FIN tbl#402|402]]}}; also known as ''Ariadne family'') is a prominent [[Asteroid family|family]] of [[S-type asteroid|stony]] [[asteroid]]s located in the [[Kirkwood gap|inner]] region of the [[asteroid belt]]. It is one of the [[Asteroid family#All families|largest families]] with more than 13,000 known members, or approximately [[Asteroid family#List|3.5% of all main-belt asteroids]].<ref name=\"Nesvorny-2014\" />\n\nThe origin and properties of this family are relatively poorly understood. It is a very broad family which gradually fades into the surrounding [[Background asteroid|background population]]. While the largest members, [[8&nbsp;Flora]] and [[43&nbsp;Ariadne]], are located near the edge, there are several distinct groupings within the family, possibly created by later, secondary collisions. Due to this complex internal structure and the poorly defined boundaries, the Flora family has also been described as an [[asteroid clan]]. Only few [[Interloper (asteroid)|interlopers]] have been identified. This family may be the source of the impactor that formed the [[Chicxulub crater]], the likely culprit in the [[Cretaceous\u2013Paleogene extinction event|extinction of the dinosaurs]].<ref name=\"Harrington\" />\n\n== Characteristics ==\n\nThe largest member is [[8 Flora]], which measures 140&nbsp;km in [[diameter]], and comprises about 80% of the total family mass. Nevertheless, the parent body was almost certainly disrupted by the impact/s that formed the family, and Flora is probably a gravitational aggregate of most of the pieces.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} [[43 Ariadne]] makes up much of the remaining mass (about a further 9%). Because of the family's poorly defined boundaries, and the location of Flora itself near the edge, it has also been called the \"Ariadne family\", when Flora did not make it into the group during an analysis (e.g. the WAM analysis by Zappal\u00e0, 1995). The remaining family members being fairly small, below 30&nbsp;km in diameter.\n\nA noticeable fraction of the parent body has been lost from the family since the original impact, presumably due to later processes such as e.g. secondary collisions. For example, it has been estimated that Flora contains only about 57% of the parent body's mass (Tanga 1999), but about 80% of the mass in the present family.\n\nThe Flora family is very broad and gradually fades into the [[Background asteroid|background population]] (which is particularly dense in this part of space) in such a way that its boundaries are very poorly defined. There are also several non-uniformities or lobes within the family, one cause of which may have been later secondary collisions between family members. Hence, it is a classical example of a so-called [[asteroid clan]]. Curiously, the largest members, [[8&nbsp;Flora]] and [[43&nbsp;Ariadne]], are located near the edge of the family. The reason for this unusual mass distribution within the family is unknown at present.\n\n[[951 Gaspra]], a medium-sized core family member, was visited by the [[Galileo spacecraft]] on its way to [[Jupiter]], and is one of the most extensively studied asteroids. Studies of Gaspra suggests that the family's age is of the order of 200 million years (indicated by the crater density), and that the parent body was at least partially [[planetary differentiation|differentiated]] (indicated by the high abundance of [[olivine]]) (Veverka 1994).\n\nThe Flora family members are considered good candidates for being the parent bodies of the [[L chondrite]] meteorites (Nesvorny 2002), which contribute about 38% of all meteorites impacting of the Earth. This theory is supported by the family's location close to the unstable zone of the <math>\\nu_6\\,\\!</math> [[secular resonance]], and because the spectral properties of family members are consistent with being the parent bodies of this meteorite type.\n\nThe Flora family was one of the five original [[Hirayama families]] that were first identified. It has a high number of early discovered members both because S-type asteroids tend to have high albedo, and because it is the closest major asteroid grouping to [[Earth]].\n\n==Location and size==\nA [[Hierarchical clustering method|HCM numerical analysis]] by [[Vincenzo Zappal\u00e0]] in 1995 determined a large group of 'core' family members, whose [[proper orbital elements]] lie in the approximate ranges\n{| class=wikitable\n! !!

However, this also includes parts of the [[Vesta family|Vesta]] and [[Nysa family|Nysa]] families in the corners so that a more likely membership estimate is 4000\u20135000 objects (by eye). This means that the Flora family represents 4\u20135% of all main belt asteroids.\n\n== Interlopers ==\n\nBecause of the high background density of asteroids in this part of space, one might expect that a great number of [[Interloper (asteroid)|interlopers]] (asteroids unrelated to the collision that formed the family) would be present. However, few have been identified. This is because interlopers are hard to distinguish from family members because the family is of the same [[asteroid spectral types|spectral type]] ([[S-type asteroid|S]]) that dominates the inner main belt overall. The few interlopers that have been identified are all small (Florczak et al. 1998, and also by inspection of the [https://www.webcitation.org/5mqq3h9Es?url=http://www.psi.edu/pds/resource/taxonomy.html PDS asteroid taxonomy data set] for non S-type members.)

They include [[298 Baptistina]], [[422 Berolina]], [[2093 Genichesk]], [[2259 Sofievka]] (the largest, with a 21&nbsp;km diameter), [[2952 Lilliputia]], [[453 Tea]], [[3533 Toyota]], [[3850 Peltier]], [[3875 Staehle]], [[4278 Harvey]], [[4396 Gressmann]], and [[4750 Mukai]].\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n\n<ref name=\"Nesvorny-2014\">{{Cite book\n  |first1     = D. |last1 = Nesvorn\u00fd\n  |first2     = M. |last2 = Broz\n  |first3     = V. |last3 = Carruba\n  |date       = December 2014\n  |title      = Identification and Dynamical Properties of Asteroid Families\n  |journal    = Asteroids IV\n  |pages      = 297\u2013321\n  |bibcode    = 2015aste.book..297N \n  |doi        = 10.2458/azu_uapress_9780816532131-ch016\n  |arxiv      = 1502.01628\n  |isbn = 9780816532131\n }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Harrington\">{{cite web\n  |date=2010-02-02\n  |title=Suspected Asteroid Collision Leaves Trailing Debris\n  |publisher=NASA Release : 10-029\n  |author=J.D.
