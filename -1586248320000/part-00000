Part of collections remained in Innsbruck, and part ultimately was moved to the [[Kunsthistorisches Museum]] in [[Vienna]]. \n\nAfter the death of his wife Philippine in 1580, he married [[Anna Caterina Gonzaga]], a daughter of [[William I, Duke of Mantua]], in 1582.\n\nArchduke Ferdinand died on 24 January 1595.

His daughter from the Mantuan marriage to Anna Caterina (later Anna Juliana) became [[Anna of Tyrol|Holy Roman Empress Anna]], consort of [[Emperor Mathias]], who received his Further Austrian inheritance.\n\n==Children==\n[[Image:PhilippineWelser.jpg|thumb|Philippine Welser, Ferdinand's first wife]]\nHe and his first wife [[Philippine Welser]] were parents of four children:\n*[[Margrave Andrew of Burgau]]<ref>[http://www.fiu.edu/~mirandas/bios1576.htm The Cardinals of the Holy Roman Church - Biographical Dictionary - Consistory of  19 November 1576<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> (15 June 1558 \u2013 12 November 1600).

Goldwater]] in [[Archie Comics]] who first appeared in the first Archie story, from ''[[Pep Comics]]'' #22 (December 1941). He is the drummer of [[the Archies]] and is son of Forsythe Pendleton Jones II; in one of the early Archie newspaper comic strips, he himself is identified as John Jugworth Jones III (and in one strip, likely due to [[continuity (fiction)|continuity]] error, as Forsythe Van Jones). He has a white [[Old English Sheepdog|sheepdog]] named Hot Dog and a younger sister, [[Jellybean Jones|Forsythia \"Jellybean\" Jones]]\n\nJughead (shortened to Jug or Juggie) is the best friend of vocalist/guitarist [[Archie Andrews]]. Jughead is a smart, sharp-tongued, laid-back, and eccentric high school student. He is obsessed with eating food and in some storylines is [[Asexuality|asexual]]. Most see him as being lazy. He can be identified by his long nose, half-closed eyes, \"S\" sweatshirt, and crown-like button [[Beanie (seamed cap)|beanie]] hat, called a [[whoopee cap]].<ref name=\"blogspot1\">{{cite web|url=http://learning2share.blogspot.com/2009/04/search-term-jugheads-hat.html |title=I'm Learning To Share!: Search term: \"Jughead's hat\" |publisher=Learning2share.blogspot.com |date=2009-04-27 |accessdate=2010-10-04}}</ref> Jughead is portrayed by [[Cole Sprouse]] in the live-action [[The CW|CW]] series, ''[[Riverdale (2017 TV series)|Riverdale]]''.\n\n==Concept and creation==\n\n[[Bob Montana]] stated that Jughead was a character he imagined, unlike other characters in the series who were based on people he knew.<ref name=\"Erickson92\">Erickson, 2005. p.92</ref> Montana's widow, Peg Bertholet, stated that high school friend of Montana's named Skinny Linehan supposedly had some of Jughead's peculiar traits.<ref name=\"Erickson92\" /> Bertholet has stated that the \"S\" insignia refers to a location called Skunk Hill in [[Haverhill, Massachusetts]] which Montana turned into Squirrel Hill.<ref name=\"ew-fa\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,316110,00.html|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|accessdate=January 17, 2014|date=November 8, 1991|author=Appelo, Tim|title=Forever Archie}}</ref> The \"S\" alludes to a combination of the location and Montana's elementary school athletic team near Haverhill called the Tigers.<ref name=\"ew-fa\" /> Bertholet has stated that \"S\" stands for \"'Squirrel Hill Independent Tigers,' and you couldn't abbreviate it any other way.\"<ref name=\"ew-fa\" />\n\n==History and character==\n\nJughead generally has a characteristic wry and [[sarcasm|sarcastic]] sense of humor. He is considered a bit of an oddity, but prefers his [[Nonconformist (Protestantism)|nonconformism]] as opposed to going along with others' styles. His many quirks make him the butt of teasing and abuse from Reggie, Veronica, and even other classmates and teachers. Many episodes involve Reggie and Jughead trying to outdo one another with pranks and bets, and Jughead almost always comes out the victor. He is revealed to be extremely clever and creative when necessary and he often takes advantage of Reggie's and his other tormentors' weaknesses (and has fun all the while).\n\nIn the earlier comics, a running gag involved various characters trying to discover Jughead's real name, while Jughead thwarted their efforts. In one story, [[Archie Andrews (comics)|Archie Andrews]] and [[Reggie Mantle]] go to the school office, where a woman tells them that Jughead's real first name is Steve. After Archie and Reggie leave the office, the audience learns that the woman is actually Jughead's aunt who has just lied as a favor to Jughead to help keep his real first name (Forsythe) hidden. In another story (issue #1 of \"The Jughead Jones Comics Digest,\" June 1977) we find out he is named after his ancestor who is an American hero. For a brief time, Jughead started to use his given name in honor of his ancestor. After learning that this ancestor was married nine times, Jughead reverted to his nickname. In the Little Archie series, his real name is revealed by [[Miss Grundy]] at the start of class.\nHe also believes his name attracts girls as in a strip, his name was mentioned and it made the girls crazed for him.\n\nAnother mystery that follows Jughead's character is the meaning of the \"S\" on his sweatshirt.  This remains a mystery to this day,  although many stories have hinted at a meaning. In Jughead #30 (1992), when his psychiatrist, Sara, asked him \"why an 'S'?\" he replied \"I dunno!  My third cousin was called skinny...\" The triangular banner on the cover of issue 140 of ''Archie & Friends'' shows that the \"S\" stands for ''Silby'', as in Silby High School, which he attended for a few months as a freshman. At one time after his sweater was filled with holes due to what he thought was a moth when it was actually a chemical accident caused in lab class, he reveals that he simply likes the letter S and finds it \"compatible,\" because the letter can stand for \"soup, sandwich, steak and all kinds of goodies!\" after his friends ask him. Betty rolls her eyes at the explanation and adds, \"S stands for \"sorry I asked\"!\" Another theory is that he is a non-conformist so when everyone wears \"R\" which stands for Riverdale he just goes with the next letter \"S\".\n\n=== Food obsession ===\nJughead is known for his love of food, especially [[hamburger]]s, and his ability to consume absurdly large quantities in a single sitting without getting sick or gaining weight, although he often sports a pot-belly immediately after a particularly large meal.  Jughead is a preferred customer of most of [[Riverdale (Archie Comics)|Riverdale's]] food establishments, especially [[List of Archie Comics characters#Pop Tate|Pop Tate]]'s Chock'lit Shoppe, except when he is behind on paying his usually lengthy tab.  In one story, he was given a \"Restaurant Club Card\" and ate out at high-class restaurants until he found out how much interest the card charged, and Pop Tate loaned him the money on the condition that he eat exclusively at the Chok'lit Shoppe.  His ability to eat so much food without gaining weight is attributed to a very rare and implausibly high [[metabolism]].  He once claimed that he weighed 300 pounds after a meal, although he is usually portrayed as slim and healthy.\n\nJughead's special abilities concerning food extend to being able to identify food in a sealed can by smell, and being able to detect the slightest flaws in food preparation by taste.  As such, he is a respected food critic, as well as a gourmet chef himself. One time, when he sought out [[Miss Grundy]]'s help with his creative writing, she suggested that he write about a subject he knew, leading to the \"Forsythe P. Jones Cookbook\".\n\nJughead often participates in eating contests, usually winning outright, or else easily coming from behind after comic distractions, and often with room to spare while the competitor retires unwell.  In a citywide eating contest, he ate a colossal burger made up of sixteen different burgers. Jughead also set two world records for eating pizza; one for speed-eating a pizza, and another for eating the most pizzas in one sitting: twelve.  Jughead's appetite is so large that even if he eats shortly before such contests, it does not affect his performance.  For example, a rival high school once sent a girl, Jane Dough, to take Jughead to various restaurants and feed him as much as possible. Amazingly, Jughead still managed to win the contest.  He explained to Jane that top athletes need to train constantly in order to stay in shape, and she actually helped him \"train\" for the contest.<ref>{{cite comic|date=June 1984|title=Archie at Riverdale High|issue=97|story=The Great All-American Pembrooke-Riverdale Food-Eating Contest!}}</ref>\n\nOne running gag depicts Jughead visiting restaurants that promise \"all you can eat\" special deals, with the devastated restaurateur closing down as Jughead leaves.<ref>e.g. {{cite comic|date=April 1992|title=Jughead with Archie Digest Magazine|issue=110|story=cover}}; {{cite journal|date=Oct 2000|title=The One-Millionth Customer!|magazine=Jughead's Double Digest Magazine|issue=70|issn=1061-5482}}</ref>\n\nDespite his appetite, Jughead is not known to be stingy with food, or to let others go hungry.  When a store selling [[penny candy]] opened in Riverdale, he spent his whole allowance on a huge bag of candy, only to meet a penniless young boy outside the shop. Jughead wrestled with his desire, but he chose to give the candy to the boy.  In a similar story, Jughead met a homeless person who liked the same kind of pizza as he did, and decided to give him the pizza he had just purchased. In another story, after winning three pizzas a week for six months for being a pizzeria's one-millionth customer, he donated them all to a soup kitchen where he volunteered.\n\nBecause of his well-known food obsession, Jughead was shown eating a hamburger on the facades of the short-lived [[Archie's Family Restaurants]].<ref name=\"How the Industry Works\">{{cite book | last1 = Rhoades | first1 = Shirrel | title = Comics Books: How the Industry Works | publisher = Peter Lang Publishing, Inc. | year = 2008 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Jn4qwJ7LdMUC& | accessdate = 2017-03-22 | isbn = 978-0820488929}}</ref>\n\n===Jughead's hat===\nJughead is almost always seen wearing his trademark beanie with both a round and square pin. This type of crown-shaped cap, called a [[whoopee cap]], sometimes a \"jughead cap\" or \"crown\", was popular among boys in the 1930s and 1940s. It was made from a man's felt [[fedora]] hat with the brim trimmed in a zig-zag and turned up.<ref name=\"blogspot1\"/> Bottle caps could be \"pinned\" in place using the cap's removable cork lining. In the 1920s and 1930s, college freshmen were sometimes required to wear them for initiation purposes, and such caps were often worn by mechanics.<ref>''[[Jughead Magazine|Jughead and Friends]]'' No.&nbsp;25 (February 2008)</ref> Similar caps have appeared on other comic book/strip, cartoon, and children's book characters such as [[List of Little Lulu characters#Main characters|Eddie Stimson]] in ''Little Lulu'', [[Little Audrey#Comic books|Melvin Wisenheimer]] in ''Little Audrey'', [[List of Berenstain Bears characters|Skuzz]] in The Berenstain Bears, and [[Encyclopedia Brown#Recurring characters|Bugs Meany]] in ''Encyclopedia Brown'' as well as on [[Goober Pyle]] on ''[[The Andy Griffith Show]]'' and [[Jeff Goldblum]]'s character \"Freak #1\" in ''[[Death Wish (1974 film)|Death Wish]]''. Jughead's hat was recolored in black in the [[Filmation]] cartoons and pink in ''[[The New Archies]]''. Over the course of the character's publication, Jughead's hat has evolved from a modified fedora to its more recognisable \"crown\" appearance.\n\nThough some view the hat as strange and immature, Jughead considers it a good luck charm and when it is taken from him, misfortune comes his way. While on the school baseball team, Jughead was pulled aside and reprimanded by school principal Mr. Weatherbee for wearing the hat instead of a proper baseball uniform cap. Jughead complied, but then started performing so badly that Weatherbee was forced to relent.\n\nIn the \"Time Police\" comic, there is a double of his beanie given to him by an unknown benefactor (later revealed to be himself) that allows him to travel in time.\n\nSome stories showed him wear a unique pin on his hat which attracts many girls to him, so he hid it to avoid the crowd of girls rushing him.\n\nThe hat also seems to define part of Jughead's personality. One story has the gang try to convince him to try a different hat, but it is revealed that whatever hat he tried on changed his personality to suit the hat. When they had him try on a detective hat, he zeroed in on clues that would have gotten Archie in trouble with Betty and Veronica, and took a hair from Reggie's sweater that implied that he sneaked a date with Midge behind Moose's back (the look on both of their faces imply he was on to something). Jughead also stated that he felt naked without a hat. Finally, Veronica gave him a special hat to try on. When he did, everyone said it suited him (it was an ugly thing but looked comical. She said she was saving it for a Mad Hatter party). Jughead tried wearing it for a day at school, but scared several students, teachers, and even Miss Beazly the cafeteria lady) they begged him to go back to his trademark hat. When he asked what they'd do if he did, they offered him a platter of hamburgers and he happily agreed.\n\nIn Jughead and Friends Digest #25 story \"The Secret of Jughead's Hat\" his cap is destroyed in a laundry accident. Wendy Weatherbee (Principal Weatherbee's niece) replaces the lost hat by doing exactly as explained above when she takes an old Fedora and cuts it and shapes it to remake the whoopee cap or crown.\n\n===Family and friends===\nJughead's best friend is [[Archie Andrews (comics)|Archie Andrews]], despite their personality difference. Archie was the first person that Jughead met upon moving to Riverdale, and he is often dragged into Archie's schemes and antics. Jughead is usually the first one to bail Archie out of trouble (though some times he only makes things worse). Jughead, extremely loyal, is willing to do almost anything to help his friend, something that Archie occasionally takes for granted.\n\nReggie Mantle is another one of Jughead's close friends, though his and Jughead's relationship is defined by their constant competition. Reggie never loses an opportunity to insult Jughead (\"needle-nose\" being his favorite nickname) and Jughead often responds with tricks to aggravate Reggie. Though it often appears they hate each other, and neither will admit otherwise, they really do care for one another. Jughead will even help Reggie escape being injured when [[Moose Mason]] is angry with him.\n\nAlongside Archie, [[Betty Cooper]] frequently slips into the best friend role for Jughead in the comics. Their mutual love and appreciation for food (she cooks, he eats), and continuously going to bat for each other have made their friendship a stronghold in the comics. While generally disinterested in matters of the heart, Jughead frequently stands up for Betty when Archie breaks her heart. In one comic, Jughead tells Betty that if he were to ever kiss a girl willingly, it would be her.\n\nJughead and [[Veronica Lodge]] are constantly arguing. Veronica cannot stand his laid-back attitude witticisms, and Jughead enjoys teasing her and making her lose her temper with clever insults. Their relationship would be considered that of \"frenemies\". Although at times, he relishes causing her to get angry because sometimes he sees her as an uncaring selfish snob. He once told Veronica he was \"mad with passion\" for her, and began popping up wherever she went, to get her off his back after she criticized him publicly. They were once cast together in a school play, which required them to kiss. Due to the way Jughead kissed her, she was caught up in the moment and fell in love with him for a while. However, Jughead managed to get her over her crush, with the help of a garlic and onion sandwich.<ref>Jughead's Double Digest #99: \"Shakespeare Anyone?\" (January 2004)</ref>\n\nJughead's other friends include [[Dilton Doiley]] and [[Moose Mason]]. Other than Dilton, Jughead probably gets along with Moose better than the other boys because of his non-confrontational attitude (and his lack of interest in Moose's girlfriend [[Midge Klump|Midge]]). Jughead's nerdy ways and lack of interest in sports and girls probably account for how well he gets along with Dilton.\n\nJughead's family includes his father, also named Forsythe, his mother Gladys, and in later comics, his younger sister Jellybean. He also has many eccentric relatives including slightly-addled Uncle Herman, or \"Doc Jones\", a daffy and slightly pompous [[inventor]] whose creations usually wreak havoc on Jughead and/or his friends and his lookalike younger cousin, Souphead. Other one-time relatives appear frequently.  Jughead also tells many stories of his ancestors, who prove to be quite as interesting as himself. A 1970s \"Archie\" cartoon episode featured Jughead's paternal grandparents\u2014''both'' of whom resemble Jughead.\n\nAnother acquaintance of Jughead's is Trula Twyst, Riverdale High's budding pop psychologist, who is constantly trying to analyze Jughead to determine what makes him so odd. The two share a strange love/hate relationship that would have gone much smoother had they not met the way they did- Trula tricked Jughead into dating her in order to become more popular.\n\nIn one story, Jughead claimed his great-grandmother was a [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] \"from the Pawtuxet tribe,\" despite the fact that the [[Patuxet]] were killed off by 1622.<ref>{{Cite comic | writer=[[George Gladir|Gladir, George]] | artist=[[Stan Goldberg|Goldberg, Stan]]|coartists=[[Mike Esposito (comics)|Mike Esposito]] | story=Liberty Island | title=Life with Archie | volume=1 | issue=255 | date=July, 1986 | publisher=Archie | location= |page=5 }}</ref> In another story from the same era, he claimed his great-great-grandfather was \"an [[eskimo]],\" who was \"the only cop north of Nome...'Ol' Bluenose Jones' they called him!\" <ref name=\"Giant Box of Comics\">{{cite web|url=http://giantboxofcomics.blogspot.com/2016/05/an-interesting-discovery.html |title=An Interesting Discovery |publisher=giantboxofcomics.blogspot.com |date=2016-05-06 |accessdate=2018-09-18}}</ref> It is likely that neither of these claims are meant to be taken seriously. In both stories he also used his claims to make fun of Veronica, which suggests more that his comments were meant as jokes, since Jughead has a history of making up fibs to tease Veronica and other opponents.\n\nIn the \"Mad Magazine\" universe, Jughead's doppelg\u00e4nger is nicknamed Bottleneck. Bottleneck wears a beanie that resembles a broken bottleneck.

Jughead's philosophy on romantic relationships, gained from observing Archie's romantic entanglements, is that dating complicates a guy's life and deprives him of cash that could be used to buy burgers. This often attracts girls rather than repels them. His most ardent admirer is [[Ethel Muggs]], an awkward but very friendly girl who chases after Jughead at every opportunity, despite Jughead's constant and blunt refusals.  Later story-lines showed a decrease in her obsession with him, and even show her dating other guys, surprisingly making Jughead jealous. Jughead secretly enjoys the attention, although he claims he puts up with Ethel's company only if she cooks for him. He has shown romantic interest in her on rare occasions, and eventually fell in love with her in the ''Life With Archie: The Married Life'' series where the \"Archie Marries Veronica\" stories ended with Jughead and Ethel's wedding.\n\nIn 2016, Jughead's orientation was confirmed to be [[asexuality|asexual]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vulture.com/2016/02/archie-jughead-asexual.html|title=Archie Comic Reveals Jughead Is Asexual|author= Abraham Riesman|date=February 8, 2016|work=Vulture|accessdate=18 September 2016}}</ref> in the stories of Chip Zdarsky (and later Ryan North and Mark Waid) for the ''[[Jughead (comic book)|Jughead]]'' comics as part of the ''[[New Riverdale]]'' line.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Chip Zdarsky Opens Up About Jughead|url = http://comicbook.com/2015/09/25/chip-zdarsky-opens-up-about-jughead/|website = Comicbook.com|access-date = 2016-02-11}}</ref> Zdarsky said of his run on the book that \"the next writer could make him discover girls or boys or both and that's totally fine.

There has never been one consistent canon explanation for Jughead's avoidance of girls and dating.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Characters/ArchieComics|title=Archie Comics/Characters|website = TV Tropes}}</ref>  In one story, Jughead declares, \"I don't hate girls\u2014I just love food more!\"<ref>{{cite comic|story=Double Your Pleasure|title=Archie's Pals 'n' Gals|issue=212|date=January 1990}}</ref>  In the story \"Phood Phobia\", Archie and [[Dilton Doiley]] discover a hidden layer to this: it turns out that Jughead is actually nervous around girls, and he turns to food for comfort.  When confronted with this, Jughead is stunned; finding out that girls are the reason he enjoys food so much makes him lose his appetite.  In another story, when Jughead saw that [[Miss Grundy]] was upset on her birthday, he rallied the other students to cheer her up.\n\nIn \"A Lass From The Past\", written by Nate Butler and first appearing in ''Jughead'' #5 (April 1988), Jughead explains the reason he does not chase after girls is because of a childhood heartbreak, sustained before he moved to [[Riverdale (Archie Comics)|Riverdale]].  Little Jughead befriended Joani and they had a [[puppy love]] relationship.  Jughead's family moved to Riverdale and he had to leave Joani behind.  Determined to not endure heartbreak again, he swore off girls, keeping little Joani's picture in his wallet as a reminder.  That changed when Debbie moved to town (in \"Jughead's Journal,\" written by Rod Ollerenshaw and also first appearing in Jughead #5), and Jughead began to overcome his old heartbreak as they started dating.  However, Joani suddenly visits town.  Now a young woman, she tells Jughead that she never forgot him and still has a crush on him, and they share their first kiss.  Before Jughead decides whether he wants to pursue a relationship with Joani, she leaves him, but with a promise that they will be together again. The comic even had Jughead say, \"Sometimes, life is just more interesting than burgers and shakes.\"<ref>{{cite comic|title=Jughead Jones Digest Magazine|issue=81|date=April 1993}}</ref>  For a while, Debbie and Joani formed Jughead's own love triangle, but fans did not like it, so both girls disappeared and Jughead reverted to his classic independent lifestyle.  A few years later, a girl named [[List of Archie Comics characters#Trula Twyst|Trula Twyst]] appeared. She tends to drive Jughead crazy with her ability to predict his next moves, and they developed a [[love-hate relationship]].\n\nAnother thread that has run through stories involves a psychic experience he is supposed to have had, caused by an odd pin he wears on his hat.  In the early 1990s, Jughead had three girlfriends: [[List of Archie Comics characters#Debbie and Joani|Debbie]], [[List of Archie Comics characters#Debbie and Joani|Joani]], and [[Minor characters in Archie Comics#January McAndrews|January McAndrews]].  The latter is Archie's descendant in the future, who starred with Jughead in [[Alternate universes in Archie Comics#Jughead's Time Police|Jughead's Time Police]], a short-lived spinoff comic about their adventures traveling through time.\n\n==Musical interests==\nJughead was the [[drummer]] for [[The Archies]]. In one four-part story, which included many flashbacks of Jughead's life, Archie had commented that the reason he'd chosen the position of drummer was that he was too introverted to play at the front of the stage. Another reason was that he could put food in his drums to eat while he played.\n\nHe has also professed a love for [[jazz]] music, once detailed in an issue of ''[[Jughead Magazine]]'' where he develops an obsession with an obscure [[jazz]] [[drum]]mer named \"Crazy\" Willie Jim. After collecting his records, Jughead finally met Jim, who was now very old, ailing and reclusive, playing on a street corner. Jughead convinced Jim that he was trustworthy and they became fast friends. Jim even played with The Archies at one of their gigs. Jim died very soon after, so Jughead sat in with Jim's friends on the corner to play one last, mournful version of \"[[St. James Infirmary Blues]]\".\n\n==Special abilities==\nIn spite of his reputation as slow and lazy, Jughead is frequently shown to be extremely intelligent, and often surprises his skeptical friends (notably [[Reggie Mantle]] and [[Veronica Lodge]]) with his vast knowledge on a wide variety of subjects, including history, [[Shakespeare]], sports, and science. In several issues, Jughead has demonstrated that his IQ is well above average. He is an extremely good student, which exasperates his teachers when he sometimes pays them no attention.\n\nHis intelligence varies from story to story. In many cases, he has trouble keeping decent grades, but was once given an award for being the best student in the school. Once, in [[Little Archie]], it was revealed that as a student, Jughead was second only to [[Dilton Doiley]]. His intelligence is displayed by his sharp wit, the occasional deep insight, and the odd chance he gets to upstage or outsmart [[Reggie Mantle]]. In one issue, [[Mr. Weatherbee]] tries to cut down on Jughead's food consumption, only to realize that Jughead's brain stops functioning without massive amounts of food. Professor [[Flutesnoot]] implies that Jughead's brain burns all the calories, which keeps him thin.\n\nJughead is also a talented artist, and refers to his works as his \"Dipsy Doodles\", which feature in one-page comic strips. Often, what he paints comes to life or becomes a real, three-dimensional object. Another recurring gag, featured in the 1960s, was \"Professor Jughead\", where he would wear a gown and mortarboard and lecture to his fellow teenagers about subjects he considered relevant. However, the content of the lesson was often nonsensical and useless in real life. ''Professor Jughead's Loony Laws'' was a strip in which he presented various [[dumb laws]].<ref>{{cite comic|date=April 1989|story=Professor Jughead's Loony Laws|title=Jughead|volume=2|issue=11|writer=Rich Margopoulos|artist=Doug Crane|coartists=Jon d'Agostino|ID={{issn|0022-5991}} }}</ref> One strip explores the fact that Jughead is seldom drawn with his eyes open by noting that Jughead has the unusual ability to \"see\" with his eyes completely shut, and not see with them open.\n\nIn his spare time, he enjoys playing [[video games]], reading [[comic books]], and [[skateboarding]]. It was also noted in one issue that he has an interest in Japanese [[anime]] and [[manga]] as well, with titles such as [[Sailor Moon|Sailor Lunar]], [[Dragon Ball Z|Dragon Tall 33]], [[Robotech|Tech Robo]], and [[Magic Knight Rayearth|Tragic Knight Sayearth]]. In the late 1980s, Jughead became obsessed with the skateboarding subculture, and his interests and taste in fashion were revamped to fit this. A number of short-lived characters were added to the ''Jughead'' comics, including his paraplegic African-American crush [[List of Archie Comics characters#Anita Chavita|Anita]]; blind rival for Ethel's affections [[List of Archie Comics characters#Jeffrey|Jeff]] and his guide dog Spike; and heavy metal band [[List of Archie Comics characters#The Potholes|The Potholes]]. However, this makeover only lasted for a few years.\n\nJughead rarely takes an interest in sports, but has a few unexpected athletic talents. These are often side effects of his other activities. For example, he is a very fast runner due to his constant evasion of [[Ethel Muggs|Ethel]] and his determination to be at the front of the lunchline every day. Coach Kleats often tries to recruit him for various school teams, usually without longterm success. Over the years, he has been seen as a basketball player, baseball pitcher, martial artist, swimmer, dancer and gymnast.\n\nMany stories revolve around other characters making comments about Jughead's appetite. One story has Dilton Doiley making calculations to scientifically prove that it's impossible for Jughead to eat the way that he does, and even convinces Pop Tate to cook everything Jughead ate earlier to prove it. When the entire gang isn't paying attention, Jughead ate all the food and ended the story by saying that if they didn't believe it they could make the food and he'd eat it again. Another story has Jughead going against a guy from another group in an eating contest. The rival gang sends a girl to feed Jughead to fill him up the night before in an effort to cheat but he manages to win anyway. In still another, Archie expresses concern over Jughead's eating and lack of exercise, which prompts Reggie to show off lifting a single crate of Pop's bottles over his head. Jughead helps Pop by effortlessly lifting three crates at once and carrying them to the back room, stunning Archie and Reggie. Unnerving them even more, he rips out a stool that Pop said he could take for a souvenir (he was replacing his counter stools later that day) with one hand again with no effort. In that story, he says he eats to get strong, cracking up Archie and Reggie, but they change their mind when they see he's very strong, and even take up eating in an effort to get strong, with no success.\n\nOften, when Jughead attempts to join a team, he ends up with an undesirable menial task, such as water-boy or equipment manager. However, he often takes part in less strenuous school activities, such as the school newspaper, ''the Blue and Gold''. His reputation as a food critic and his unbiased views of the school teams make him a valuable member of the staff. In some stories, Jughead has been shown to have supernatural abilities that are never seen again. These include controlling weather, giving the evil-eye, learning the skills presented in any book he reads, and predicting the future.\n\nIn the \"[[Alternate universes in Archie Comics#Super Teens|Super Teens]]\" stories (where several of the main ''Archie'' characters are secretly [[superheroes]]), Jughead could become '''Captain Hero''', gaining a caped costume and more muscular physique (varying from story to story), but retaining his crown-shaped cap. Captain Hero appeared when Jughead recites the magic incantation (similar to [[Green Lantern]]'s oath):\n\n''Teeny weeny magic beanie pointing towards the sky; give me muscle, power, vigor - form a super guy!''\n\nCaptain Hero often seemed to possess just the right powers for the problem at hand. These were never completely defined, but he maintained certain \"stock\" superhuman powers, such as flight, enhanced strength and resistance to injury. Early on, Captain Hero was often the most serious and competent of the Super Teens, and the others would defer to his leadership, in contrast to Jughead's perceived status as Archie's sidekick and a generally lazy individual.\n\n==Hot Dog==\n[[File:Jughd.jpg|thumb|Jughead and Hot Dog]]\nHot Dog is a long-haired [[mixed-breed dog|mutt]] who resembles a white [[Old English Sheepdog]]. He belongs to Jughead, although when he first appeared in ''Pep Comics'' #224 (December 1968), he belonged to Archie. Hot Dog switched owners frequently in his early appearances, but was eventually given a permanent home with Jughead.\n\nHot Dog usually thinks like a [[human]], in that his thoughts are presented in [[thought bubble]]s. He is lazy, constantly hungry, and, much like Jughead, has a dislike for [[Reggie Mantle]].\n\nHot Dog is usually considered a member of [[List of Archie Comics characters#Main characters|Archie's Gang]]. He tends to be attracted to [[Veronica Lodge]]\u2019s pedigreed dogs, and even had a litter of puppies with one of them, a poodle named Lucretia, much to Veronica's chagrin.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} In the 1970s series ''[[Sabrina the Teenage Witch]]'', Hot Dog has a [[sidekick]], Chili Dog, who is smaller and red-haired. A [[running gag]] is the two dogs' \"battles\" with Sabrina's cat [[Salem Saberhagen]]. In the [[Alternate universes in Archie Comics#Hot Dog|alternate universe limited series ''Jughead's Pal, Hot Dog'']], when Jughead's family objects to Hot Dog living indoors because he is covered in dirt, [[Dilton Doiley]] builds Hot Dog a [[doghouse]] full of whimsical inventions. Hot Dog's sidekick in that short-lived series is a chihuahua named Pablito.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.archiecomics.com/acpaco/diduknow/diduknow_november.htm |title=November \"Did You Know?\" |accessdate=2010-02-17 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071020232609/http://www.archiecomics.com/acpaco/diduknow/diduknow_november.htm |archivedate=October 20, 2007 }}</ref>\n\n=== In other media ===\nIn the [[Filmation]] animated series ''[[The Archie Show]]'', Hot Dog is the mascot for [[The Archies]] and is often portrayed as pretending to \"conduct\" the band.\n\n==Other versions==\n\n===''Afterlife with Archie''===\nJughead appears in the first issue of ''[[Afterlife with Archie]]'' before being bitten by a resurrected Hot Dog, which transforms him into a zombie. He is referred to as \"Patient Zero\" in terms of being the first one affected. However, the eighth issue reveals that Jughead is a ghost and his soul is no longer in his body; whatever is controlling his corpse isn't him.\n\n===''Jughead: The Hunger''===\nIn this [[Archie Horror]] spin-off, Jughead is a werewolf responsible for a number of murders in Riverdale and becomes known as \"The Riverdale Ripper.\" He and Archie realize he's a werewolf after he murders Dilton during a full moon. The next day, Betty reveals that he comes from a long-line of [[lycanthropy]] dating all the way back to medieval England and that her ancestors have always been there to stop them. Not wanting Betty to murder his friend, Archie suggests going to the botanical gardens to cure Jughead with Wolfsbane. This works for a couple of months, but after it wears off and Jughead murders Reggie in his wolf state, he leaves town with Hot Dog as he knows Betty wouldn't give him a second chance.\n\n===''Life with Archie: The Married Life''===\nJughead appears in ''[[Life with Archie#Volume 2 (The Married Life)|Life with Archie: The Married Life]]'' beginning in 2010. In this series, Jughead has taken over Pop's from Pop Tate and has renamed it Jughead's, which later spanned a franchise in each respective universe.<ref>''Life with Archie: The Married Life'' 1</ref> He ended up abandoning the franchise to operate the original shoppe in Riverdale.

This version of Jughead is markedly different from the comic character, exhibiting a darker, moodier demeanor. In the show, Jughead wears an ordinary dark gray knitted hat with points and pins, but appears in a dream sequence wearing his distinctive crown cap and \"S\" sweatshirt. His mother and sister are mentioned but absent, having left due to his father's drinking. His father, F.P., is leader of the Southside Serpents, and Jughead, choosing not to live with him, is homeless. In the first-season finale, the Serpents offer Jughead one of their jackets, essentially making him an honorary member. In the second season, he undergoes an initiation that includes a brutal beating to become a full-fledged member. Over time, he becomes a de facto leader of the teenagers in the gang, and in the second-season finale, after he attempts to save the Serpents from a fight with a rival gang that badly outnumbers them by trading himself, F.P. retires and names him as his successor. Finaly in the third season Jughead's dad retires and made Jughead the Serpent king.

Goldwater]] in [[Archie Comics]] who first appeared in the first Archie story, from ''[[Pep Comics]]'' #22 (December 1941). He is the drummer of [[the Archies]] and is son of Forsythe Pendleton Jones II; in one of the early Archie newspaper comic strips, he himself is identified as John Jugworth Jones III (and in one strip, likely due to [[continuity (fiction)|continuity]] error, as Forsythe Van Jones). He has a white [[Old English Sheepdog|sheepdog]] named Hot Dog and a younger sister, [[Jellybean Jones|Forsythia \"Jellybean\" Jones]]\n\nJughead (shortened to Jug or Juggie) is the best friend of vocalist/guitarist [[Archie Andrews]]. Jughead is a smart, sharp-tongued, laid-back, and eccentric high school student. He is obsessed with eating food and in some storylines is [[Asexuality|asexual]]. Most see him as being lazy. He can be identified by his long nose, half-closed eyes, \"S\" sweatshirt, and crown-like button [[Beanie (seamed cap)|beanie]] hat, called a [[whoopee cap]].<ref name=\"blogspot1\">{{cite web|url=http://learning2share.blogspot.com/2009/04/search-term-jugheads-hat.html |title=I'm Learning To Share!: Search term: \"Jughead's hat\" |publisher=Learning2share.blogspot.com |date=2009-04-27 |accessdate=2010-10-04}}</ref> Jughead is portrayed by [[Cole Sprouse]] in the live-action [[The CW|CW]] series, ''[[Riverdale (2017 TV series)|Riverdale]]''.\n\n==Concept and creation==\n\n[[Bob Montana]] stated that Jughead was a character he imagined, unlike other characters in the series who were based on people he knew.<ref name=\"Erickson92\">Erickson, 2005. p.92</ref> Montana's widow, Peg Bertholet, stated that high school friend of Montana's named Skinny Linehan supposedly had some of Jughead's peculiar traits.<ref name=\"Erickson92\" /> Bertholet has stated that the \"S\" insignia refers to a location called Skunk Hill in [[Haverhill, Massachusetts]] which Montana turned into Squirrel Hill.<ref name=\"ew-fa\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,316110,00.html|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|accessdate=January 17, 2014|date=November 8, 1991|author=Appelo, Tim|title=Forever Archie}}</ref> The \"S\" alludes to a combination of the location and Montana's elementary school athletic team near Haverhill called the Tigers.<ref name=\"ew-fa\" /> Bertholet has stated that \"S\" stands for \"'Squirrel Hill Independent Tigers,' and you couldn't abbreviate it any other way.\"<ref name=\"ew-fa\" />\n\n==History and character==\n\nJughead generally has a characteristic wry and [[sarcasm|sarcastic]] sense of humor. He is considered a bit of an oddity, but prefers his [[Nonconformist (Protestantism)|nonconformism]] as opposed to going along with others' styles. His many quirks make him the butt of teasing and abuse from Reggie, Veronica, and even other classmates and teachers. Many episodes involve Reggie and Jughead trying to outdo one another with pranks and bets, and Jughead almost always comes out the victor. He is revealed to be extremely clever and creative when necessary and he often takes advantage of Reggie's and his other tormentors' weaknesses (and has fun all the while).\n\nIn the earlier comics, a running gag involved various characters trying to discover Jughead's real name, while Jughead thwarted their efforts. In one story, [[Archie Andrews (comics)|Archie Andrews]] and [[Reggie Mantle]] go to the school office, where a woman tells them that Jughead's real first name is Steve. After Archie and Reggie leave the office, the audience learns that the woman is actually Jughead's aunt who has just lied as a favor to Jughead to help keep his real first name (Forsythe) hidden. In another story (issue #1 of \"The Jughead Jones Comics Digest,\" June 1977) we find out he is named after his ancestor who is an American hero. For a brief time, Jughead started to use his given name in honor of his ancestor. After learning that this ancestor was married nine times, Jughead reverted to his nickname. In the Little Archie series, his real name is revealed by [[Miss Grundy]] at the start of class.\nHe also believes his name attracts girls as in a strip, his name was mentioned and it made the girls crazed for him.\n\nAnother mystery that follows Jughead's character is the meaning of the \"S\" on his sweatshirt.  This remains a mystery to this day,  although many stories have hinted at a meaning. In Jughead #30 (1992), when his psychiatrist, Sara, asked him \"why an 'S'?\" he replied \"I dunno!  My third cousin was called skinny...\" The triangular banner on the cover of issue 140 of ''Archie & Friends'' shows that the \"S\" stands for ''Silby'', as in Silby High School, which he attended for a few months as a freshman. At one time after his sweater was filled with holes due to what he thought was a moth when it was actually a chemical accident caused in lab class, he reveals that he simply likes the letter S and finds it \"compatible,\" because the letter can stand for \"soup, sandwich, steak and all kinds of goodies!\" after his friends ask him. Betty rolls her eyes at the explanation and adds, \"S stands for \"sorry I asked\"!\" Another theory is that he is a non-conformist so when everyone wears \"R\" which stands for Riverdale he just goes with the next letter \"S\".\n\n=== Food obsession ===\nJughead is known for his love of food, especially [[hamburger]]s, and his ability to consume absurdly large quantities in a single sitting without getting sick or gaining weight, although he often sports a pot-belly immediately after a particularly large meal.  Jughead is a preferred customer of most of [[Riverdale (Archie Comics)|Riverdale's]] food establishments, especially [[List of Archie Comics characters#Pop Tate|Pop Tate]]'s Chock'lit Shoppe, except when he is behind on paying his usually lengthy tab.  In one story, he was given a \"Restaurant Club Card\" and ate out at high-class restaurants until he found out how much interest the card charged, and Pop Tate loaned him the money on the condition that he eat exclusively at the Chok'lit Shoppe.  His ability to eat so much food without gaining weight is attributed to a very rare and implausibly high [[metabolism]].  He once claimed that he weighed 300 pounds after a meal, although he is usually portrayed as slim and healthy.\n\nJughead's special abilities concerning food extend to being able to identify food in a sealed can by smell, and being able to detect the slightest flaws in food preparation by taste.  As such, he is a respected food critic, as well as a gourmet chef himself. One time, when he sought out [[Miss Grundy]]'s help with his creative writing, she suggested that he write about a subject he knew, leading to the \"Forsythe P. Jones Cookbook\".\n\nJughead often participates in eating contests, usually winning outright, or else easily coming from behind after comic distractions, and often with room to spare while the competitor retires unwell.  In a citywide eating contest, he ate a colossal burger made up of sixteen different burgers. Jughead also set two world records for eating pizza; one for speed-eating a pizza, and another for eating the most pizzas in one sitting: twelve.  Jughead's appetite is so large that even if he eats shortly before such contests, it does not affect his performance.  For example, a rival high school once sent a girl, Jane Dough, to take Jughead to various restaurants and feed him as much as possible. Amazingly, Jughead still managed to win the contest.  He explained to Jane that top athletes need to train constantly in order to stay in shape, and she actually helped him \"train\" for the contest.<ref>{{cite comic|date=June 1984|title=Archie at Riverdale High|issue=97|story=The Great All-American Pembrooke-Riverdale Food-Eating Contest!}}</ref>\n\nOne running gag depicts Jughead visiting restaurants that promise \"all you can eat\" special deals, with the devastated restaurateur closing down as Jughead leaves.<ref>e.g. {{cite comic|date=April 1992|title=Jughead with Archie Digest Magazine|issue=110|story=cover}}; {{cite journal|date=Oct 2000|title=The One-Millionth Customer!|magazine=Jughead's Double Digest Magazine|issue=70|issn=1061-5482}}</ref>\n\nDespite his appetite, Jughead is not known to be stingy with food, or to let others go hungry.  When a store selling [[penny candy]] opened in Riverdale, he spent his whole allowance on a huge bag of candy, only to meet a penniless young boy outside the shop. Jughead wrestled with his desire, but he chose to give the candy to the boy.  In a similar story, Jughead met a homeless person who liked the same kind of pizza as he did, and decided to give him the pizza he had just purchased. In another story, after winning three pizzas a week for six months for being a pizzeria's one-millionth customer, he donated them all to a soup kitchen where he volunteered.\n\nBecause of his well-known food obsession, Jughead was shown eating a hamburger on the facades of the short-lived [[Archie's Family Restaurants]].<ref name=\"How the Industry Works\">{{cite book | last1 = Rhoades | first1 = Shirrel | title = Comics Books: How the Industry Works | publisher = Peter Lang Publishing, Inc. | year = 2008 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Jn4qwJ7LdMUC& | accessdate = 2017-03-22 | isbn = 978-0820488929}}</ref>\n\n===Jughead's hat===\nJughead is almost always seen wearing his trademark beanie with both a round and square pin. This type of crown-shaped cap, called a [[whoopee cap]], sometimes a \"jughead cap\" or \"crown\", was popular among boys in the 1930s and 1940s. It was made from a man's felt [[fedora]] hat with the brim trimmed in a zig-zag and turned up.<ref name=\"blogspot1\"/> Bottle caps could be \"pinned\" in place using the cap's removable cork lining. In the 1920s and 1930s, college freshmen were sometimes required to wear them for initiation purposes, and such caps were often worn by mechanics.<ref>''[[Jughead Magazine|Jughead and Friends]]'' No.&nbsp;25 (February 2008)</ref> Similar caps have appeared on other comic book/strip, cartoon, and children's book characters such as [[List of Little Lulu characters#Main characters|Eddie Stimson]] in ''Little Lulu'', [[Little Audrey#Comic books|Melvin Wisenheimer]] in ''Little Audrey'', [[List of Berenstain Bears characters|Skuzz]] in The Berenstain Bears, and [[Encyclopedia Brown#Recurring characters|Bugs Meany]] in ''Encyclopedia Brown'' as well as on [[Goober Pyle]] on ''[[The Andy Griffith Show]]'' and [[Jeff Goldblum]]'s character \"Freak #1\" in ''[[Death Wish (1974 film)|Death Wish]]''. Jughead's hat was recolored in black in the [[Filmation]] cartoons and pink in ''[[The New Archies]]''. Over the course of the character's publication, Jughead's hat has evolved from a modified fedora to its more recognisable \"crown\" appearance.\n\nThough some view the hat as strange and immature, Jughead considers it a good luck charm and when it is taken from him, misfortune comes his way. While on the school baseball team, Jughead was pulled aside and reprimanded by school principal Mr. Weatherbee for wearing the hat instead of a proper baseball uniform cap. Jughead complied, but then started performing so badly that Weatherbee was forced to relent.\n\nIn the \"Time Police\" comic, there is a double of his beanie given to him by an unknown benefactor (later revealed to be himself) that allows him to travel in time.\n\nSome stories showed him wear a unique pin on his hat which attracts many girls to him, so he hid it to avoid the crowd of girls rushing him.\n\nThe hat also seems to define part of Jughead's personality. One story has the gang try to convince him to try a different hat, but it is revealed that whatever hat he tried on changed his personality to suit the hat. When they had him try on a detective hat, he zeroed in on clues that would have gotten Archie in trouble with Betty and Veronica, and took a hair from Reggie's sweater that implied that he sneaked a date with Midge behind Moose's back (the look on both of their faces imply he was on to something). Jughead also stated that he felt naked without a hat. Finally, Veronica gave him a special hat to try on. When he did, everyone said it suited him (it was an ugly thing but looked comical. She said she was saving it for a Mad Hatter party). Jughead tried wearing it for a day at school, but scared several students, teachers, and even Miss Beazly the cafeteria lady) they begged him to go back to his trademark hat. When he asked what they'd do if he did, they offered him a platter of hamburgers and he happily agreed.\n\nIn Jughead and Friends Digest #25 story \"The Secret of Jughead's Hat\" his cap is destroyed in a laundry accident. Wendy Weatherbee (Principal Weatherbee's niece) replaces the lost hat by doing exactly as explained above when she takes an old Fedora and cuts it and shapes it to remake the whoopee cap or crown.\n\n===Family and friends===\nJughead's best friend is [[Archie Andrews (comics)|Archie Andrews]], despite their personality difference. Archie was the first person that Jughead met upon moving to Riverdale, and he is often dragged into Archie's schemes and antics. Jughead is usually the first one to bail Archie out of trouble (though some times he only makes things worse). Jughead, extremely loyal, is willing to do almost anything to help his friend, something that Archie occasionally takes for granted.\n\nReggie Mantle is another one of Jughead's close friends, though his and Jughead's relationship is defined by their constant competition. Reggie never loses an opportunity to insult Jughead (\"needle-nose\" being his favorite nickname) and Jughead often responds with tricks to aggravate Reggie. Though it often appears they hate each other, and neither will admit otherwise, they really do care for one another. Jughead will even help Reggie escape being injured when [[Moose Mason]] is angry with him.\n\nAlongside Archie, [[Betty Cooper]] frequently slips into the best friend role for Jughead in the comics. Their mutual love and appreciation for food (she cooks, he eats), and continuously going to bat for each other have made their friendship a stronghold in the comics. While generally disinterested in matters of the heart, Jughead frequently stands up for Betty when Archie breaks her heart. In one comic, Jughead tells Betty that if he were to ever kiss a girl willingly, it would be her.\n\nJughead and [[Veronica Lodge]] are constantly arguing. Veronica cannot stand his laid-back attitude witticisms, and Jughead enjoys teasing her and making her lose her temper with clever insults. Their relationship would be considered that of \"frenemies\". Although at times, he relishes causing her to get angry because sometimes he sees her as an uncaring selfish snob. He once told Veronica he was \"mad with passion\" for her, and began popping up wherever she went, to get her off his back after she criticized him publicly. They were once cast together in a school play, which required them to kiss. Due to the way Jughead kissed her, she was caught up in the moment and fell in love with him for a while. However, Jughead managed to get her over her crush, with the help of a garlic and onion sandwich.<ref>Jughead's Double Digest #99: \"Shakespeare Anyone?\" (January 2004)</ref>\n\nJughead's other friends include [[Dilton Doiley]] and [[Moose Mason]]. Other than Dilton, Jughead probably gets along with Moose better than the other boys because of his non-confrontational attitude (and his lack of interest in Moose's girlfriend [[Midge Klump|Midge]]). Jughead's nerdy ways and lack of interest in sports and girls probably account for how well he gets along with Dilton.\n\nJughead's family includes his father, also named Forsythe, his mother Gladys, and in later comics, his younger sister Jellybean. He also has many eccentric relatives including slightly-addled Uncle Herman, or \"Doc Jones\", a daffy and slightly pompous [[inventor]] whose creations usually wreak havoc on Jughead and/or his friends and his lookalike younger cousin, Souphead. Other one-time relatives appear frequently.  Jughead also tells many stories of his ancestors, who prove to be quite as interesting as himself. A 1970s \"Archie\" cartoon episode featured Jughead's paternal grandparents\u2014''both'' of whom resemble Jughead.\n\nAnother acquaintance of Jughead's is Trula Twyst, Riverdale High's budding pop psychologist, who is constantly trying to analyze Jughead to determine what makes him so odd. The two share a strange love/hate relationship that would have gone much smoother had they not met the way they did- Trula tricked Jughead into dating her in order to become more popular.\n\nIn one story, Jughead claimed his great-grandmother was a [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] \"from the Pawtuxet tribe,\" despite the fact that the [[Patuxet]] were killed off by 1622.<ref>{{Cite comic | writer=[[George Gladir|Gladir, George]] | artist=[[Stan Goldberg|Goldberg, Stan]]|coartists=[[Mike Esposito (comics)|Mike Esposito]] | story=Liberty Island | title=Life with Archie | volume=1 | issue=255 | date=July, 1986 | publisher=Archie | location= |page=5 }}</ref> In another story from the same era, he claimed his great-great-grandfather was \"an [[eskimo]],\" who was \"the only cop north of Nome...'Ol' Bluenose Jones' they called him!\" <ref name=\"Giant Box of Comics\">{{cite web|url=http://giantboxofcomics.blogspot.com/2016/05/an-interesting-discovery.html |title=An Interesting Discovery |publisher=giantboxofcomics.blogspot.com |date=2016-05-06 |accessdate=2018-09-18}}</ref> It is likely that neither of these claims are meant to be taken seriously. In both stories he also used his claims to make fun of Veronica, which suggests more that his comments were meant as jokes, since Jughead has a history of making up fibs to tease Veronica and other opponents.\n\nIn the \"Mad Magazine\" universe, Jughead's doppelg\u00e4nger is nicknamed Bottleneck. Bottleneck wears a beanie that resembles a broken bottleneck. His best friend (and fellow juvenile delinquent) is Starchie.<ref>{{cite comic|story=STARCHIE! |title=Mad Magazine|issue=12|date=June 1954|writer=Harvey Kurtzman|artist=Will Elder|pages=1-8}}, reprinted in ''MAD About the Fifties'' (1997), QPB</ref>\n\n===Miniseries===\n[[Alternate universes in Archie Comics#Jughead's Time Police|''Jughead's Time Police'']] was a series that began in 1990 featuring Jughead as a hero of the 29th century and a member of the Time Police, an organization that ensures history to remain the same for the future's sake. In this series, the beanie gives Jughead the ability to time travel by thinking.

Jughead's philosophy on romantic relationships, gained from observing Archie's romantic entanglements, is that dating complicates a guy's life and deprives him of cash that could be used to buy burgers. This often attracts girls rather than repels them. His most ardent admirer is [[Ethel Muggs]], an awkward but very friendly girl who chases after Jughead at every opportunity, despite Jughead's constant and blunt refusals.  Later story-lines showed a decrease in her obsession with him, and even show her dating other guys, surprisingly making Jughead jealous. Jughead secretly enjoys the attention, although he claims he puts up with Ethel's company only if she cooks for him. He has shown romantic interest in her on rare occasions, and eventually fell in love with her in the ''Life With Archie: The Married Life'' series where the \"Archie Marries Veronica\" stories ended with Jughead and Ethel's wedding.\n\nIn 2016, Jughead's orientation was confirmed to be [[asexuality|asexual]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vulture.com/2016/02/archie-jughead-asexual.html|title=Archie Comic Reveals Jughead Is Asexual|author= Abraham Riesman|date=February 8, 2016|work=Vulture|accessdate=18 September 2016}}</ref> in the stories of Chip Zdarsky (and later Ryan North and Mark Waid) for the ''[[Jughead (comic book)|Jughead]]'' comics as part of the ''[[New Riverdale]]'' line.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Chip Zdarsky Opens Up About Jughead|url = http://comicbook.com/2015/09/25/chip-zdarsky-opens-up-about-jughead/|website = Comicbook.com|access-date = 2016-02-11}}</ref> Zdarsky said of his run on the book that \"the next writer could make him discover girls or boys or both and that's totally fine.

There has never been one consistent canon explanation for Jughead's avoidance of girls and dating.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Characters/ArchieComics|title=Archie Comics/Characters|website = TV Tropes}}</ref>  In one story, Jughead declares, \"I don't hate girls\u2014I just love food more!\"<ref>{{cite comic|story=Double Your Pleasure|title=Archie's Pals 'n' Gals|issue=212|date=January 1990}}</ref>  In the story \"Phood Phobia\", Archie and [[Dilton Doiley]] discover a hidden layer to this: it turns out that Jughead is actually nervous around girls, and he turns to food for comfort.  When confronted with this, Jughead is stunned; finding out that girls are the reason he enjoys food so much makes him lose his appetite.  In another story, when Jughead saw that [[Miss Grundy]] was upset on her birthday, he rallied the other students to cheer her up.\n\nIn \"A Lass From The Past\", written by Nate Butler and first appearing in ''Jughead'' #5 (April 1988), Jughead explains the reason he does not chase after girls is because of a childhood heartbreak, sustained before he moved to [[Riverdale (Archie Comics)|Riverdale]].  Little Jughead befriended Joani and they had a [[puppy love]] relationship.  Jughead's family moved to Riverdale and he had to leave Joani behind.  Determined to not endure heartbreak again, he swore off girls, keeping little Joani's picture in his wallet as a reminder.  That changed when Debbie moved to town (in \"Jughead's Journal,\" written by Rod Ollerenshaw and also first appearing in Jughead #5), and Jughead began to overcome his old heartbreak as they started dating.  However, Joani suddenly visits town.  Now a young woman, she tells Jughead that she never forgot him and still has a crush on him, and they share their first kiss.  Before Jughead decides whether he wants to pursue a relationship with Joani, she leaves him, but with a promise that they will be together again. The comic even had Jughead say, \"Sometimes, life is just more interesting than burgers and shakes.\"<ref>{{cite comic|title=Jughead Jones Digest Magazine|issue=81|date=April 1993}}</ref>  For a while, Debbie and Joani formed Jughead's own love triangle, but fans did not like it, so both girls disappeared and Jughead reverted to his classic independent lifestyle.  A few years later, a girl named [[List of Archie Comics characters#Trula Twyst|Trula Twyst]] appeared. She tends to drive Jughead crazy with her ability to predict his next moves, and they developed a [[love-hate relationship]].\n\nAnother thread that has run through stories involves a psychic experience he is supposed to have had, caused by an odd pin he wears on his hat.  In the early 1990s, Jughead had three girlfriends: [[List of Archie Comics characters#Debbie and Joani|Debbie]], [[List of Archie Comics characters#Debbie and Joani|Joani]], and [[Minor characters in Archie Comics#January McAndrews|January McAndrews]].  The latter is Archie's descendant in the future, who starred with Jughead in [[Alternate universes in Archie Comics#Jughead's Time Police|Jughead's Time Police]], a short-lived spinoff comic about their adventures traveling through time.\n\n==Musical interests==\nJughead was the [[drummer]] for [[The Archies]]. In one four-part story, which included many flashbacks of Jughead's life, Archie had commented that the reason he'd chosen the position of drummer was that he was too introverted to play at the front of the stage. Another reason was that he could put food in his drums to eat while he played.\n\nHe has also professed a love for [[jazz]] music, once detailed in an issue of ''[[Jughead Magazine]]'' where he develops an obsession with an obscure [[jazz]] [[drum]]mer named \"Crazy\" Willie Jim. After collecting his records, Jughead finally met Jim, who was now very old, ailing and reclusive, playing on a street corner. Jughead convinced Jim that he was trustworthy and they became fast friends. Jim even played with The Archies at one of their gigs. Jim died very soon after, so Jughead sat in with Jim's friends on the corner to play one last, mournful version of \"[[St. James Infirmary Blues]]\".\n\n==Special abilities==\nIn spite of his reputation as slow and lazy, Jughead is frequently shown to be extremely intelligent, and often surprises his skeptical friends (notably [[Reggie Mantle]] and [[Veronica Lodge]]) with his vast knowledge on a wide variety of subjects, including history, [[Shakespeare]], sports, and science. In several issues, Jughead has demonstrated that his IQ is well above average. He is an extremely good student, which exasperates his teachers when he sometimes pays them no attention.\n\nHis intelligence varies from story to story. In many cases, he has trouble keeping decent grades, but was once given an award for being the best student in the school. Once, in [[Little Archie]], it was revealed that as a student, Jughead was second only to [[Dilton Doiley]]. His intelligence is displayed by his sharp wit, the occasional deep insight, and the odd chance he gets to upstage or outsmart [[Reggie Mantle]]. In one issue, [[Mr. Weatherbee]] tries to cut down on Jughead's food consumption, only to realize that Jughead's brain stops functioning without massive amounts of food. Professor [[Flutesnoot]] implies that Jughead's brain burns all the calories, which keeps him thin.\n\nJughead is also a talented artist, and refers to his works as his \"Dipsy Doodles\", which feature in one-page comic strips. Often, what he paints comes to life or becomes a real, three-dimensional object. Another recurring gag, featured in the 1960s, was \"Professor Jughead\", where he would wear a gown and mortarboard and lecture to his fellow teenagers about subjects he considered relevant. However, the content of the lesson was often nonsensical and useless in real life. ''Professor Jughead's Loony Laws'' was a strip in which he presented various [[dumb laws]].<ref>{{cite comic|date=April 1989|story=Professor Jughead's Loony Laws|title=Jughead|volume=2|issue=11|writer=Rich Margopoulos|artist=Doug Crane|coartists=Jon d'Agostino|ID={{issn|0022-5991}} }}</ref> One strip explores the fact that Jughead is seldom drawn with his eyes open by noting that Jughead has the unusual ability to \"see\" with his eyes completely shut, and not see with them open.\n\nIn his spare time, he enjoys playing [[video games]], reading [[comic books]], and [[skateboarding]]. It was also noted in one issue that he has an interest in Japanese [[anime]] and [[manga]] as well, with titles such as [[Sailor Moon|Sailor Lunar]], [[Dragon Ball Z|Dragon Tall 33]], [[Robotech|Tech Robo]], and [[Magic Knight Rayearth|Tragic Knight Sayearth]]. In the late 1980s, Jughead became obsessed with the skateboarding subculture, and his interests and taste in fashion were revamped to fit this. A number of short-lived characters were added to the ''Jughead'' comics, including his paraplegic African-American crush [[List of Archie Comics characters#Anita Chavita|Anita]]; blind rival for Ethel's affections [[List of Archie Comics characters#Jeffrey|Jeff]] and his guide dog Spike; and heavy metal band [[List of Archie Comics characters#The Potholes|The Potholes]]. However, this makeover only lasted for a few years.\n\nJughead rarely takes an interest in sports, but has a few unexpected athletic talents. These are often side effects of his other activities. For example, he is a very fast runner due to his constant evasion of [[Ethel Muggs|Ethel]] and his determination to be at the front of the lunchline every day. Coach Kleats often tries to recruit him for various school teams, usually without longterm success. Over the years, he has been seen as a basketball player, baseball pitcher, martial artist, swimmer, dancer and gymnast.\n\nMany stories revolve around other characters making comments about Jughead's appetite. One story has Dilton Doiley making calculations to scientifically prove that it's impossible for Jughead to eat the way that he does, and even convinces Pop Tate to cook everything Jughead ate earlier to prove it. When the entire gang isn't paying attention, Jughead ate all the food and ended the story by saying that if they didn't believe it they could make the food and he'd eat it again. Another story has Jughead going against a guy from another group in an eating contest. The rival gang sends a girl to feed Jughead to fill him up the night before in an effort to cheat but he manages to win anyway. In still another, Archie expresses concern over Jughead's eating and lack of exercise, which prompts Reggie to show off lifting a single crate of Pop's bottles over his head. Jughead helps Pop by effortlessly lifting three crates at once and carrying them to the back room, stunning Archie and Reggie. Unnerving them even more, he rips out a stool that Pop said he could take for a souvenir (he was replacing his counter stools later that day) with one hand again with no effort. In that story, he says he eats to get strong, cracking up Archie and Reggie, but they change their mind when they see he's very strong, and even take up eating in an effort to get strong, with no success.\n\nOften, when Jughead attempts to join a team, he ends up with an undesirable menial task, such as water-boy or equipment manager. However, he often takes part in less strenuous school activities, such as the school newspaper, ''the Blue and Gold''. His reputation as a food critic and his unbiased views of the school teams make him a valuable member of the staff. In some stories, Jughead has been shown to have supernatural abilities that are never seen again. These include controlling weather, giving the evil-eye, learning the skills presented in any book he reads, and predicting the future.\n\nIn the \"[[Alternate universes in Archie Comics#Super Teens|Super Teens]]\" stories (where several of the main ''Archie'' characters are secretly [[superheroes]]), Jughead could become '''Captain Hero''', gaining a caped costume and more muscular physique (varying from story to story), but retaining his crown-shaped cap. Captain Hero appeared when Jughead recites the magic incantation (similar to [[Green Lantern]]'s oath):\n\n''Teeny weeny magic beanie pointing towards the sky; give me muscle, power, vigor - form a super guy!''\n\nCaptain Hero often seemed to possess just the right powers for the problem at hand. These were never completely defined, but he maintained certain \"stock\" superhuman powers, such as flight, enhanced strength and resistance to injury. Early on, Captain Hero was often the most serious and competent of the Super Teens, and the others would defer to his leadership, in contrast to Jughead's perceived status as Archie's sidekick and a generally lazy individual.\n\n==Hot Dog==\n[[File:Jughd.jpg|thumb|Jughead and Hot Dog]]\nHot Dog is a long-haired [[mixed-breed dog|mutt]] who resembles a white [[Old English Sheepdog]]. He belongs to Jughead, although when he first appeared in ''Pep Comics'' #224 (December 1968), he belonged to Archie. Hot Dog switched owners frequently in his early appearances, but was eventually given a permanent home with Jughead.\n\nHot Dog usually thinks like a [[human]], in that his thoughts are presented in [[thought bubble]]s. He is lazy, constantly hungry, and, much like Jughead, has a dislike for [[Reggie Mantle]].\n\nHot Dog is usually considered a member of [[List of Archie Comics characters#Main characters|Archie's Gang]]. He tends to be attracted to [[Veronica Lodge]]\u2019s pedigreed dogs, and even had a litter of puppies with one of them, a poodle named Lucretia, much to Veronica's chagrin.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} In the 1970s series ''[[Sabrina the Teenage Witch]]'', Hot Dog has a [[sidekick]], Chili Dog, who is smaller and red-haired. A [[running gag]] is the two dogs' \"battles\" with Sabrina's cat [[Salem Saberhagen]]. In the [[Alternate universes in Archie Comics#Hot Dog|alternate universe limited series ''Jughead's Pal, Hot Dog'']], when Jughead's family objects to Hot Dog living indoors because he is covered in dirt, [[Dilton Doiley]] builds Hot Dog a [[doghouse]] full of whimsical inventions. Hot Dog's sidekick in that short-lived series is a chihuahua named Pablito.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.archiecomics.com/acpaco/diduknow/diduknow_november.htm |title=November \"Did You Know?\" |accessdate=2010-02-17 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071020232609/http://www.archiecomics.com/acpaco/diduknow/diduknow_november.htm |archivedate=October 20, 2007 }}</ref>\n\n=== In other media ===\nIn the [[Filmation]] animated series ''[[The Archie Show]]'', Hot Dog is the mascot for [[The Archies]] and is often portrayed as pretending to \"conduct\" the band.\n\n==Other versions==\n\n===''Afterlife with Archie''===\nJughead appears in the first issue of ''[[Afterlife with Archie]]'' before being bitten by a resurrected Hot Dog, which transforms him into a zombie. He is referred to as \"Patient Zero\" in terms of being the first one affected. However, the eighth issue reveals that Jughead is a ghost and his soul is no longer in his body; whatever is controlling his corpse isn't him.\n\n===''Jughead: The Hunger''===\nIn this [[Archie Horror]] spin-off, Jughead is a werewolf responsible for a number of murders in Riverdale and becomes known as \"The Riverdale Ripper.\" He and Archie realize he's a werewolf after he murders Dilton during a full moon. The next day, Betty reveals that he comes from a long-line of [[lycanthropy]] dating all the way back to medieval England and that her ancestors have always been there to stop them. Not wanting Betty to murder his friend, Archie suggests going to the botanical gardens to cure Jughead with Wolfsbane. This works for a couple of months, but after it wears off and Jughead murders Reggie in his wolf state, he leaves town with Hot Dog as he knows Betty wouldn't give him a second chance.\n\n===''Life with Archie: The Married Life''===\nJughead appears in ''[[Life with Archie#Volume 2 (The Married Life)|Life with Archie: The Married Life]]'' beginning in 2010. In this series, Jughead has taken over Pop's from Pop Tate and has renamed it Jughead's, which later spanned a franchise in each respective universe.<ref>''Life with Archie: The Married Life'' 1</ref> He ended up abandoning the franchise to operate the original shoppe in Riverdale. In this series, he ends up marrying [[Midge Klump]] in one universe, and Ethel in the other.\n\n==In other media==\n===Animated===\n* Jughead appeared in ''[[The Archie Show]]'', a 1968 animated series produced by [[Filmation]]. He also appeared in the various spin-offs produced in the same format. He was voiced by [[Howard Morris]].\n* Jughead appeared in the animated video for \"[[Sugar, Sugar]]\", by [[The Archies]], as the band's drummer.\n* Jughead was featured in a Filmation-animated segment for ''[[Sesame Street]]'' spotlighting the letter J.\n* A short-lived show in the 1970s, ''[[Archie's TV Funnies]]'', featured other comic strip characters, such as [[Broom-Hilda|Broom Hilda]] and [[Smokey Stover]]. Archie introduced each educational short, like a lesson on the importance of bathing from Nancy and Sluggo.\n* Another show, ''[[The U.S. of Archie]]'', depicted Archie and the gang as themselves in different historical eras. The goal was to teach history.\n* Jughead appeared in ''[[The New Archies]]'', a 1987 re-imagining of Archie and the gang. Jughead was portrayed as a pre-teen in junior high. He was voiced by Michael Fantini. \n* Jughead appeared in ''[[Archie's Weird Mysteries]]'', voiced by Chris Lundquist.\n*In ''[[The Simpsons]]'', Jughead, Moose, Archie, and Reggie made a cameo beating up [[Homer Simpson]] in \"[[Sideshow Bob Roberts]]\".\n\n===Live-action===\n[[File:Cole Sprouse by Gage Skidmore.jpg|thumb|upright=0.6|[[Cole Sprouse]] plays Jughead on ''[[Riverdale (2017 TV series)|Riverdale]]''.]]\n* Derrel Maury<ref>{{imdb name|0561278|Derrel Maury}}</ref> played Jughead in \"Archie\", a 1976 episode of the ''ABC Saturday Comedy Special''; this was intended to be the [[Television pilot|pilot]] for a new series, which never materialized.<ref name=Archie76>{{imdb episode|0768855|Archie}}</ref> He reprised this role in the 1978 [[Television film|TV-movie]] ''The Archie Situation Comedy Musical Variety Show''.<ref name=Archie78>{{imdb title|1291664|The Archie Situation Comedy Musical Variety Show}}</ref>\n* Jughead appears in ''[[Archie: To Riverdale and Back Again]]'', a 1990 TV movie which was broadcast on [[National Broadcasting Company|NBC]], portrayed by [[Sam Whipple]].

This version of Jughead is markedly different from the comic character, exhibiting a darker, moodier demeanor. In the show, Jughead wears an ordinary dark gray knitted hat with points and pins, but appears in a dream sequence wearing his distinctive crown cap and \"S\" sweatshirt. His mother and sister are mentioned but absent, having left due to his father's drinking. His father, F.P., is leader of the Southside Serpents, and Jughead, choosing not to live with him, is homeless. In the first-season finale, the Serpents offer Jughead one of their jackets, essentially making him an honorary member. In the second season, he undergoes an initiation that includes a brutal beating to become a full-fledged member. Over time, he becomes a de facto leader of the teenagers in the gang, and in the second-season finale, after he attempts to save the Serpents from a fight with a rival gang that badly outnumbers them by trading himself, F.P. retires and names him as his successor.\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|40em}}\n\n===References===\n* {{cite book |last=Erickson |first=Hal |authorlink=Hal Erickson (author) |year=2005 |title=Television Cartoon Shows |edition=2nd|volume=1 |publisher=McFardland and Company|isbn=07864-2255-6}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://archiecomics.com Official website]\n*[http://www.toonopedia.com/jughead.htm Archie's Pal, Jughead] at [[Don Markstein's Toonopedia]].

It has been used primarily in [[medical sanitation]] and sterile work facilities. Increasingly, it has been employed to sterilize [[drinking water|drinking]] and [[wastewater]], as the holding facilities are enclosed and can be circulated to ensure a higher exposure to the UV.

Ultraviolet Germicidal Irradiation Handbook, Fig. 5.5]]\nThis process is similar to the effect of longer wavelengths ([[UVB]]) producing [[sunburn]] in humans. Microorganisms have less protection against UV, and cannot survive prolonged exposure to it.\n\nA UVGI system is designed to expose environments such as [[water tank]]s, sealed rooms and [[HVAC|forced air system]]s to germicidal UV. Exposure comes from [[germicidal lamp]]s that emit germicidal UV at the correct wavelength, thus irradiating the environment. The forced flow of air or water through this environment ensures exposure.\n\n==Effectiveness==\nThe effectiveness of germicidal UV depends on the length of time a microorganism is exposed to UV, the intensity and wavelength of the UV radiation, the presence of particles that can protect the microorganisms from UV, and a microorganism's ability to [[Radioresistance|withstand]] UV during its exposure.\n\nIn many systems, redundancy in exposing microorganisms to UV is achieved by circulating the air or water repeatedly. This ensures multiple passes so that the UV is effective against the highest number of microorganisms and will irradiate resistant microorganisms more than once to break them down.\n\n\"Sterilization\" is often misquoted as being achievable. While it is theoretically possible in a controlled environment, it is very difficult to prove and the term \"disinfection\" is generally used by companies offering this service as to avoid legal reprimand. Specialist companies will often advertise a certain [[log reduction]], e.g., 6-log reduction or 99.9999% effective, instead of sterilization. This takes into consideration a phenomenon known as light and dark repair ([[photoreactivation]] and [[base excision repair]], respectively), in which a cell can [[Pyrimidine dimer#DNA repair|repair DNA]] that has been damaged by UV light.\n\nThe effectiveness of this form of disinfection depends on [[wikt:line of sight|line-of-sight]] exposure of the microorganisms to the UV light. Environments where design creates obstacles that block the UV light are not as effective. In such an environment, the effectiveness is then reliant on the placement of the UVGI system so that line of sight is optimum for disinfection.\n\n[[Dust]] and films coating the bulb lower UV output. Therefore, bulbs require periodic cleaning and replacement to ensure effectiveness. The lifetime of germicidal UV bulbs varies depending on design. Also, the material that the bulb is made of can absorb some of the germicidal rays.\n\nLamp cooling under airflow can also lower UV output; thus, care should be taken to shield lamps from direct airflow, or to add additional lamps to compensate for the cooling effect.\n\nIncreases in effectiveness and UV intensity can be achieved by using reflection. Aluminum has the highest reflectivity rate versus other metals and is recommended when using UV{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}.\n\nOne method for gauging UV effectiveness in water disinfection applications is to compute UV dose. The U.S. EPA publishes UV dosage guidelines for water treatment applications.<ref >{{cite web\n  |url=https://cfpub.epa.gov/si/si_public_record_Report.cfm?Lab=NRMRL&dirEntryId=49846\n  |title=Design Manual: Municipal Wastewater Disinfection\n}}</ref> UV dose cannot be measured directly but can be inferred based on the known or estimated inputs to the process:\n* Flow rate (contact time)\n* Transmittance (light reaching the target)\n* Turbidity (cloudiness)\n* Lamp age or [[fouling]] or outages (reduction in UV intensity)\n\nIn air and surface disinfection applications the UV effectiveness is estimated by calculating the UV dose which will be delivered to the microbial population. The UV dose is calculated as follows:\n\nUV dose \u03bcWs/cm<sup>2</sup>  = UV intensity \u03bcW/cm<sup>2</sup>  \u00d7 exposure time (seconds)<ref >[http://www.americanairandwater.com/uv-definitions/index.htm UV dose]</ref>\n\nThe UV intensity is specified for each lamp at a distance of 1 meter. UV intensity is inversely proportional to the square of the distance so it decreases at longer distances. Alternatively, it rapidly increases at distances shorter than 1m. In the above formula the UV intensity must always be adjusted for distance unless the UV dose is calculated at exactly 1m from the lamp. Also, to ensure effectiveness the UV dose must be calculated at the end of lamp life (EOL is specified in number of hours when the lamp is expected to reach 80% of its initial UV output) and at the furthest distance from the lamp on the periphery of the target area. Some ''shatter-proof'' lamps are coated with a fluorated ethylene polymer to contain glass shards and mercury in case of breakage; this coating reduces UV output by as much as 20%.\n\nTo accurately predict what UV dose will be delivered to the target the UV intensity, adjusted for distance, coating and end of lamp life, will be multiplied by the exposure time. In static applications the exposure time can be as long as needed for an effective UV dose to be reached. In case of rapidly moving air, in AC air ducts for example, the exposure time is short so the UV intensity must be increased by introducing multiple UV lamps or even banks of lamps. Also, the UV installation must be located in a long straight duct section with the lamps perpendicular to the air flow to maximize the exposure time.\n\nThese calculations actually predict the UV fluence and it is assumed that the UV fluence will be equal to the UV dose. The UV dose is the amount of germicidal UV energy absorbed by a microbial population over a period of time. If the microorganisms are planktonic (free floating) the UV fluence will be equal the UV dose. However, if the microorganisms are protected by mechanical particles, such as dust and dirt, or have formed [[biofilm]] a much higher UV fluence will be needed for an effective UV dose to be introduced to the microbial population.\n\n===Inactivation of microorganisms===\nThe degree of inactivation by ultraviolet radiation is directly related to the UV dose applied to the water. The dosage, a product of UV light intensity and exposure time, is usually measured in microjoules per square centimeter, or equivalently as microwatt seconds per square centimeter (\u03bcW\u00b7s/cm<sup>2</sup>)<!--1 \u00b5W\u00b7s/cm<sup>2</sup> =  10 mW\u00b7s/m<sup>2</sup> = 0.01 W\u00b7s/m<sup>2</sup>, the latter might be better, giving two-digit values for the ones in this article-->. Dosages for a 90% kill of most bacteria and viruses range from 2,000 to 8,000&nbsp;\u03bcW\u00b7s/cm<sup>2</sup>. Larger parasites such as cryptosporidium require a lower dose for inactivation. As a result, the [[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] has accepted UV disinfection as a method for drinking water plants to obtain cryptosporidium, giardia or virus inactivation credits. For example, for a 90% reduction of cryptosporidium, a minimum dose of 2,500&nbsp;\u03bcW\u00b7s/cm<sup>2</sup> is required based on the U.S. EPA UV Guidance Manual published in 2006.<ref name=\"epa_lt2\"/>{{rp|1\u20137}}\n\n==Strengths and weaknesses==\n\n===Advantages===\n{{Details|Disinfectant}}\nUV water treatment devices can be used for well water and surface water disinfection. UV treatment compares favourably with other water disinfection systems in terms of cost, labour and the need for technically trained personnel for operation. [[Water chlorination]] treats larger organisms and offers residual disinfection, but these systems are expensive because they need special operator training and a steady supply of a potentially hazardous material. Finally, boiling of water is the most reliable treatment method but it demands labour and imposes a high economic cost. UV treatment is rapid and, in terms of primary energy use, approximately 20,000 times more efficient than boiling.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\n=== Disadvantages ===\nUV disinfection is most effective for treating high-clarity, purified [[reverse osmosis]] distilled water. Suspended particles are a problem because microorganisms buried within particles are shielded from the UV light and pass through the unit unaffected. However, UV systems can be coupled with a pre-filter to remove those larger organisms that would otherwise pass through the UV system unaffected. The pre-filter also clarifies the water to improve light transmittance and therefore UV dose throughout the entire water column. Another key factor of UV water treatment is the flow rate\u2014if the flow is too high, water will pass through without sufficient UV exposure. If the flow is too low, heat may build up and damage the UV lamp.<ref>Gadgil, A., 1997, ''Field-testing UV Disinfection of Drinking Water'', Water Engineering Development Center, University of Loughborough, UK: LBNL 40360.</ref>\n\nA disadvantage of UVGI is that while water treated by chlorination is resistant to reinfection (until the chlorine off-gasses), UVGI water is not resistant to reinfection. UVGI water must be transported or delivered in such a way as to avoid reinfection.\n\n==Safety ==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2008}}\nIn UVGI systems the lamps are shielded or are in environments that limit exposure, such as a closed water tank or closed air circulation system, often with interlocks that automatically shut off the UV lamps if the system is opened for access by humans.\n\nFor human beings, skin exposure to germicidal wavelengths of UV light can produce rapid sunburn and [[skin cancer]].<ref name=\"Liverpool, UVGI\" >{{Cite web\n  |title=Ultraviolet germicidal irradiation\n  |publisher=[[University of Liverpool]]\n  |page=3\n  |url=https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/media/livacuk/radiation/pdf/UV_germicidal.pdf\n  |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160806185506/https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/media/livacuk/radiation/pdf/UV_germicidal.pdf\n  |archive-date=2016-08-06\n  |url-status=dead\n}}</ref> Exposure of the eyes to this UV radiation can produce extremely painful inflammation of the [[cornea]] and temporary or permanent [[vision impairment]], up to and including [[blindness]] in some cases.  UV can damage the [[retina]] of the eye.<ref name=\"Liverpool, UVGI\" />\n\nAnother potential danger is the UV production of [[ozone]], which can be harmful to one's health. The US Environmental Protection Agency designated 0.05 [[parts per million]] (ppm) of ozone to be a safe level. Lamps designed to release UVC and higher frequencies are doped so that any UV light below 254&nbsp;nm wavelengths will not be released, to minimize ozone production. A full-spectrum lamp will release all UV wavelengths, and will produce ozone when UVC hits oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) molecules.\n\nUVC radiation is able to break down chemical bonds. This leads to rapid [[polymer degradation|aging]] of plastics, insulation, [[gasket]]s, and other materials. Note that plastics sold to be \"UV-resistant\" are tested only for UVB, as UVC doesn't normally reach the surface of the Earth. When UV is used near plastic, rubber, or insulation, care should be taken to shield these items; metal tape or aluminum foil will suffice.\n\nThe [[American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists]] (ACGIH) Committee on Physical Agents has established a [[threshold limit value]] (TLV) for UVC exposure to avoid such skin and eye injuries among those most susceptible. For 254&nbsp;nm UV, this TLV is 6&nbsp;mJ/cm<sup>2</sup> over an eight-hour period. The TLV function differs by wavelengths because of variable energy and potential for cell damage. This TLV is supported by the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection and is used in setting lamp safety standards by the Illuminating Engineering Society of North America. When the Tuberculosis Ultraviolet Shelter Study was planned, this TLV was interpreted as if eye exposure in rooms was continuous over eight hours and at the highest eye-level irradiance found in the room. In those highly unlikely conditions, a 6.0&nbsp;mJ/cm<sup>2</sup> dose is reached under the ACGIH TLV after just eight hours of continuous exposure to an irradiance of 0.2&nbsp;\u03bcW/cm<sup>2</sup>. Thus, 0.2&nbsp;\u03bcW/cm<sup>2</sup> was widely interpreted as the upper permissible limit of irradiance at eye height.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.americanairandwater.com/uv-facts/UV-Safety-Study.pdf|title=Safety of Upper-Room Ultraviolet Germicidal Air Disinfection for Room Occupants: Results from the Tuberculosis Ultraviolet Shelter Study|last=Nardell|first=Edward|date=January\u2013February 2008|website=UV And People's Health|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n==Uses==\n===Air disinfection By abhishek singh \n===\nUVGI can be used to disinfect air with prolonged exposure. Disinfection is a function of UV intensity and time. For this reason, it is not as effective on moving air, or when the lamp is perpendicular to the flow, as exposure times are dramatically reduced. Air purification UVGI systems can be free-standing units with shielded UV lamps that use a fan to force air past the UV light. Other systems are installed in forced air systems so that the circulation for the premises moves microorganisms past the lamps. Key to this form of sterilization is placement of the UV lamps and a good filtration system to remove the dead microorganisms.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.purifier.org/snapcat/iaq.pdf|title=Environmental Analysis of Indoor Air Pollution|publisher=CaluTech UV Air|accessdate=2006-12-05}}</ref>  For example, forced air systems by design impede line-of-sight, thus creating areas of the environment that will be shaded from the UV light. However, a UV lamp placed at the coils and drain pans of cooling systems will keep microorganisms from forming in these naturally damp places.\n\nASHRAE covers UVGI and its applications in indoor air quality and building maintenance in \"Ultraviolet Lamp Systems\", Chapter 16 of its 2008 Handbook, ''HVAC Systems and Equipment''. Its 2011 Handbook, ''HVAC Applications'', covers \"Ultraviolet air and surface treatment\" in Chapter 60.\n\n===Water disinfection===\n[[Image:Steripen in use.jpg|thumb|right|A portable, battery-powered, low-pressure mercury-vapour discharge lamp for water sterilization.]]\n\nUltraviolet disinfection of water is a purely physical, chemical-free process. Even [[parasite]]s such as ''cryptosporidia'' or ''giardia'', which are extremely resistant to chemical disinfectants, are efficiently reduced. UV can also be used to remove chlorine and chloramine species from water; this process is called [[photolysis]], and requires a higher dose than normal disinfection. The sterilized microorganisms are not removed from the water. UV disinfection does not remove dissolved organics, inorganic compounds or particles in the water.<ref>Harm, W., 1980, ''Biological Effects of Ultraviolet Radiation, International Union of Pure and Applied Biophysics'', Biophysics series, Cambridge University Press.{{pn|date=June 2017}}</ref> The world's largest water disinfection plant treats drinking water for New York city.

However, it was recently discovered that ultraviolet radiation can be somewhat effective for treating the microorganism Cryptosporidium. The findings resulted in the use of UV radiation as a viable method to treat drinking water. Giardia in turn has been shown to be very susceptible to UVC when the tests were based on infectivity rather than excystation.<ref>{{Cite journal | title = Inactivation of Giardia muris by low pressure ultraviolet light | author = Ware, M.

This is in large part because of concerns that reaction of the chlorine with organic compounds in the waste water stream could synthesize potentially toxic and long lasting [[chlorinated organics]] and also because of the [[environmental risk]]s of storing chlorine gas or chlorine containing chemicals.  Individual wastestreams to be treated by UVGI must be tested to ensure that the method will be effective due to potential interferences such as [[suspended solids]], dyes, or other substances that may block or absorb the UV radiation. According to the [[World Health Organization]], \"UV units to treat small batches (1 to several liters) or low flows (1 to several liters per minute) of water at the community level are estimated to have costs of US$20 per megaliter, including the cost of electricity and consumables and the annualized capital cost of the unit.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/dwq/wsh0207/en/index4.html |publisher=WHO |work=Water, sanitation and health |title=Drinking water quality |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081002081406/http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/dwq/wsh0207/en/index4.html |archivedate=2008-10-02 }}</ref>\n\nLarge-scale urban UV [[wastewater treatment]] is performed in cities such as [[Edmonton, Alberta]]. The use of ultraviolet light has now become standard practice in most municipal wastewater treatment processes. Effluent is now starting to be recognized as a valuable resource, not a problem that needs to be dumped. Many wastewater facilities are being renamed as water reclamation facilities, whether the wastewater is discharged into a river, used to irrigate crops, or injected into an aquifer for later recovery. Ultraviolet light is now being used to ensure water is free from harmful organisms.\n\n===Aquarium and pond===\nUltraviolet sterilizers are often used to help control unwanted microorganisms in aquaria and ponds. UV irradiation ensures that  pathogens cannot reproduce, thus decreasing the likelihood of a disease outbreak in an aquarium.\n\nAquarium and pond sterilizers are typically small, with fittings for tubing that allows the water to flow through the sterilizer on its way from a separate external filter or water pump.  Within the sterilizer, water flows as close as possible to the ultraviolet light source. Water pre-filtration is critical as water turbidity lowers UVC penetration.\nMany of the better UV sterilizers have long dwell times and limit the space between the UVC source and the inside wall of the UV sterilizer device.<ref>{{cite web |title=UV sterilization; aquarium and pond |publisher=American Aquarium Products |url=http://www.americanaquariumproducts.com/AquariumUVSterilization.html }}</ref>{{third-party-inline|date=May 2015}}\n\n===Laboratory hygiene===\nUVGI is often used to disinfect equipment such as safety [[goggles]], instruments, [[pipettors]], and other devices.  Lab personnel also disinfect glassware and plasticware this way.  Microbiology laboratories use UVGI to disinfect surfaces inside [[Laminar flow cabinet|biological safety cabinets]] (\"hoods\") between uses.\n\n===Food and beverage protection===\nSince the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] issued a rule in 2001 requiring that virtually all [[Fruit juice|fruit]] and [[vegetable juice]] producers follow [[HACCP]] controls, and mandating a 5-[[log reduction]] in pathogens, UVGI has seen some use in sterilization of juices such as fresh-pressed [[apple cider]].\n\n== Technology ==\n{{see also|Ultraviolet#Artificial_sources}}\n\n===Lamps===\n[[Image:Germicidal Lamp 1.jpg|thumb|right|A 9 W [[germicidal lamp]] in a [[compact fluorescent lamp]] form factor]]\n{{Main article|Germicidal lamp}}\n\nGermicidal UV for disinfection is most typically generated by a [[mercury-vapor lamp]]. Low-pressure mercury vapor has a strong emission line at 254&nbsp;nm, which is within the range of wavelengths that demonstrate strong disinfection effect.  The optimal wavelengths for disinfection are close to 270&nbsp;nm.<ref name=\"epa_lt2\" />{{rp|2\u20136}}\n\nMercury vapor lamps may be categorized as either low pressure (including amalgam) or medium-pressure lamps. Low-pressure UV lamps offer high efficiencies (approx 35% UVC) but lower power, typically 1&nbsp;W/cm power density (power per unit of arc length). Amalgam UV lamps utilize an amalgam to control mercury pressure to allow operation at somewhat higher temperature and power density. They operate at higher temperatures and have a lifetime of up to 16,000 hours. Their efficiency is slightly lower than that of traditional low-pressure lamps (approx 33% UVC output) and power density is approximately 2\u20133&nbsp;W/cm. Medium-pressure UV lamps operate at much higher temperatures, up to about 800 degrees Celsius, and have a polychromatic output spectrum and a high radiation output but lower UVC efficiency of 10% or less. Typical power density is 30&nbsp;W/cm<sup>3</sup> or greater.\n\nDepending on the quartz glass used for the lamp body, low-pressure and amalgam UV emit radiation at 254&nbsp;nm and also at 185&nbsp;nm, which has chemical effects. UV radiation at 185&nbsp;nm is used to generate ozone.\n\nThe UV lamps for water treatment consist of specialized low-pressure mercury-vapor lamps that produce ultraviolet radiation at 254&nbsp;nm, or medium-pressure UV lamps that produce a [[polychromatic]] output from 200&nbsp;nm to visible and infrared energy. The UV lamp never contacts the water; it is either housed in a quartz glass sleeve inside the water chamber or mounted external to the water which flows through the transparent UV tube. Water passing through the flow chamber is exposed to UV rays which are absorbed by suspended solids, such as microorganisms and dirt, in the stream.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Wolfe, R.L. |year=1990 |title=Ultraviolet disinfection of potable water |journal= Environmental Science & Technology|volume=24 |issue=6 |pages=768\u2013773|bibcode=1990EnST...24..768W |doi=10.1021/es00076a001 }}</ref>\n\n=== Light emitting diodes (LEDs) ===\n[[File:UVC LED.jpg|thumb|Compact and versatile options with UVC LEDs]]\nRecent developments in [[Light-emitting diode|LED technology]] have led to commercially available UVC LEDs. UVC LEDs use semiconductors to emit light between 255&nbsp;nm-280&nbsp;nm.<ref name=\"Messina 2015\" /> The wavelength emission is tuneable by adjusting the material of the semiconductor. As of 2019, the electrical-to-UVC conversion efficiency of LEDs was lower than that of mercury lamps. The reduced size of LEDs opens up options for small reactor systems allowing for point-of-use applications and integration into medical devices.<ref name=\"Hessling et al 2016\">{{Cite journal |last=Hessling|first=Martin|last2=Gross|first2=Andrej|last3=Hoenes|first3=Katharina|last4=Rath|first4=Monika|last5=Stangl|first5=Felix|last6=Tritschler|first6=Hanna|last7=Sift|first7=Michael|date=2016-01-27|title=Efficient Disinfection of Tap and Surface Water with Single High Power 285&nbsp;nm LED and Square Quartz Tube|journal=Photonics|language=en|volume=3|issue=1|pages=7|doi=10.3390/photonics3010007}}</ref> Low power consumption of semiconductors introduce UV disinfection systems that utilized small solar cells in remote or Third World applications.<ref name=\"Hessling et al 2016\" />\n\nUVC LEDs don't necessarily last longer than traditional germicidal lamps in terms of hours used, and instead have more-variable engineering characteristics and better tolerance for short-term operation. A UVC LED can achieve a longer installed time than a traditional germicidal lamp in intermittent use.  Likewise, LED degradation increases with heat, while filament and HID lamp output wavelength is dependent on temperature, so engineers can design LEDs of particular size and cost to have higher output and faster degradation or lower output and a slower decline over time.\n\n===Water treatment systems===\nSizing of a UV system is affected by three variables: flow rate, lamp power, and UV transmittance in the water. Manufacturers typically developed sophisticated [[Computational fluid dynamics|Computational Fluid Dynamics]] (CFD) models validated with [[Bioassay#Environmental bioassays|bioassay]] testing. This involves testing the UV reactor's disinfection performance with either [[Bacteriophage MS2|MS2]] or T1 [[bacteriophage]]s at various flow rates, UV transmittance, and power levels in order to develop a regression model for system sizing. For example, this is a requirement for all drinking water systems in the United States per the EPA UV Guidance Manual.<ref name=\"epa_lt2\">{{Cite web |title=Ultraviolet disinfection guidance manual for the final long term 2 enhanced surface water treatment rule |url=http://www.epa.gov/ogwdw000/disinfection/lt2/pdfs/guide_lt2_uvguidance.pdf |accessdate=30 January 2011 |date=November 2006 |publisher=United States Environmental Protection Agency |location=Washington, DC }}</ref>{{rp|5-2}}\n\nThe flow profile is produced from the chamber geometry, flow rate, and particular turbulence model selected. The radiation profile is developed from inputs such as water quality, lamp type (power, germicidal efficiency, spectral output, arc length), and the transmittance and dimension of the quartz sleeve. Proprietary CFD software simulates both the flow and radiation profiles. Once the 3D model of the chamber is built, it is populated with a grid or mesh that comprises thousands of small cubes.\n\nPoints of interest\u2014such as at a bend, on the quartz sleeve surface, or around the wiper mechanism\u2014use a higher resolution mesh, whilst other areas within the reactor use a coarse mesh. Once the mesh is produced, hundreds of thousands of virtual particles are \"fired\" through the chamber. Each particle has several variables of interest associated with it, and the particles are \"harvested\" after the reactor. Discrete phase modeling produces delivered dose, head loss, and other chamber-specific parameters.\n\nWhen the modeling phase is complete, selected systems are validated using a professional third party to provide oversight and to determine how closely the model is able to predict the reality of system performance.

Ultraviolet Germicidal Irradiation Handbook, Fig. 5.5]]\nThis process is similar to the effect of longer wavelengths ([[UVB]]) producing [[sunburn]] in humans. Microorganisms have less protection against UV, and cannot survive prolonged exposure to it.\n\nA UVGI system is designed to expose environments such as [[water tank]]s, sealed rooms and [[HVAC|forced air system]]s to germicidal UV. Exposure comes from [[germicidal lamp]]s that emit germicidal UV at the correct wavelength, thus irradiating the environment. The forced flow of air or water through this environment ensures exposure.\n\n==Effectiveness==\nThe effectiveness of germicidal UV depends on the length of time a microorganism is exposed to UV, the intensity and wavelength of the UV radiation, the presence of particles that can protect the microorganisms from UV, and a microorganism's ability to [[Radioresistance|withstand]] UV during its exposure.\n\nIn many systems, redundancy in exposing microorganisms to UV is achieved by circulating the air or water repeatedly. This ensures multiple passes so that the UV is effective against the highest number of microorganisms and will irradiate resistant microorganisms more than once to break them down.\n\n\"Sterilization\" is often misquoted as being achievable. While it is theoretically possible in a controlled environment, it is very difficult to prove and the term \"disinfection\" is generally used by companies offering this service as to avoid legal reprimand. Specialist companies will often advertise a certain [[log reduction]], e.g., 6-log reduction or 99.9999% effective, instead of sterilization. This takes into consideration a phenomenon known as light and dark repair ([[photoreactivation]] and [[base excision repair]], respectively), in which a cell can [[Pyrimidine dimer#DNA repair|repair DNA]] that has been damaged by UV light.\n\nThe effectiveness of this form of disinfection depends on [[wikt:line of sight|line-of-sight]] exposure of the microorganisms to the UV light. Environments where design creates obstacles that block the UV light are not as effective. In such an environment, the effectiveness is then reliant on the placement of the UVGI system so that line of sight is optimum for disinfection.\n\n[[Dust]] and films coating the bulb lower UV output. Therefore, bulbs require periodic cleaning and replacement to ensure effectiveness. The lifetime of germicidal UV bulbs varies depending on design. Also, the material that the bulb is made of can absorb some of the germicidal rays.\n\nLamp cooling under airflow can also lower UV output; thus, care should be taken to shield lamps from direct airflow, or to add additional lamps to compensate for the cooling effect.\n\nIncreases in effectiveness and UV intensity can be achieved by using reflection. Aluminum has the highest reflectivity rate versus other metals and is recommended when using UV{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}.\n\nOne method for gauging UV effectiveness in water disinfection applications is to compute UV dose. The U.S. EPA publishes UV dosage guidelines for water treatment applications.<ref >{{cite web\n  |url=https://cfpub.epa.gov/si/si_public_record_Report.cfm?Lab=NRMRL&dirEntryId=49846\n  |title=Design Manual: Municipal Wastewater Disinfection\n}}</ref> UV dose cannot be measured directly but can be inferred based on the known or estimated inputs to the process:\n* Flow rate (contact time)\n* Transmittance (light reaching the target)\n* Turbidity (cloudiness)\n* Lamp age or [[fouling]] or outages (reduction in UV intensity)\n\nIn air and surface disinfection applications the UV effectiveness is estimated by calculating the UV dose which will be delivered to the microbial population. The UV dose is calculated as follows:\n\nUV dose \u03bcWs/cm<sup>2</sup>  = UV intensity \u03bcW/cm<sup>2</sup>  \u00d7 exposure time (seconds)<ref >[http://www.americanairandwater.com/uv-definitions/index.htm UV dose]</ref>\n\nThe UV intensity is specified for each lamp at a distance of 1 meter. UV intensity is inversely proportional to the square of the distance so it decreases at longer distances. Alternatively, it rapidly increases at distances shorter than 1m. In the above formula the UV intensity must always be adjusted for distance unless the UV dose is calculated at exactly 1m from the lamp. Also, to ensure effectiveness the UV dose must be calculated at the end of lamp life (EOL is specified in number of hours when the lamp is expected to reach 80% of its initial UV output) and at the furthest distance from the lamp on the periphery of the target area. Some ''shatter-proof'' lamps are coated with a fluorated ethylene polymer to contain glass shards and mercury in case of breakage; this coating reduces UV output by as much as 20%.\n\nTo accurately predict what UV dose will be delivered to the target the UV intensity, adjusted for distance, coating and end of lamp life, will be multiplied by the exposure time. In static applications the exposure time can be as long as needed for an effective UV dose to be reached. In case of rapidly moving air, in AC air ducts for example, the exposure time is short so the UV intensity must be increased by introducing multiple UV lamps or even banks of lamps. Also, the UV installation must be located in a long straight duct section with the lamps perpendicular to the air flow to maximize the exposure time.\n\nThese calculations actually predict the UV fluence and it is assumed that the UV fluence will be equal to the UV dose. The UV dose is the amount of germicidal UV energy absorbed by a microbial population over a period of time. If the microorganisms are planktonic (free floating) the UV fluence will be equal the UV dose. However, if the microorganisms are protected by mechanical particles, such as dust and dirt, or have formed [[biofilm]] a much higher UV fluence will be needed for an effective UV dose to be introduced to the microbial population.\n\n===Inactivation of microorganisms===\nThe degree of inactivation by ultraviolet radiation is directly related to the UV dose applied to the water. The dosage, a product of UV light intensity and exposure time, is usually measured in microjoules per square centimeter, or equivalently as microwatt seconds per square centimeter (\u03bcW\u00b7s/cm<sup>2</sup>)<!--1 \u00b5W\u00b7s/cm<sup>2</sup> =  10 mW\u00b7s/m<sup>2</sup> = 0.01 W\u00b7s/m<sup>2</sup>, the latter might be better, giving two-digit values for the ones in this article-->. Dosages for a 90% kill of most bacteria and viruses range from 2,000 to 8,000&nbsp;\u03bcW\u00b7s/cm<sup>2</sup>. Larger parasites such as cryptosporidium require a lower dose for inactivation. As a result, the [[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] has accepted UV disinfection as a method for drinking water plants to obtain cryptosporidium, giardia or virus inactivation credits. For example, for a 90% reduction of cryptosporidium, a minimum dose of 2,500&nbsp;\u03bcW\u00b7s/cm<sup>2</sup> is required based on the U.S. EPA UV Guidance Manual published in 2006.<ref name=\"epa_lt2\"/>{{rp|1\u20137}}\n\n==Strengths and weaknesses==\n\n===Advantages===\n{{Details|Disinfectant}}\nUV water treatment devices can be used for well water and surface water disinfection. UV treatment compares favourably with other water disinfection systems in terms of cost, labour and the need for technically trained personnel for operation. [[Water chlorination]] treats larger organisms and offers residual disinfection, but these systems are expensive because they need special operator training and a steady supply of a potentially hazardous material. Finally, boiling of water is the most reliable treatment method but it demands labour and imposes a high economic cost. UV treatment is rapid and, in terms of primary energy use, approximately 20,000 times more efficient than boiling.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\n=== Disadvantages ===\nUV disinfection is most effective for treating high-clarity, purified [[reverse osmosis]] distilled water. Suspended particles are a problem because microorganisms buried within particles are shielded from the UV light and pass through the unit unaffected. However, UV systems can be coupled with a pre-filter to remove those larger organisms that would otherwise pass through the UV system unaffected. The pre-filter also clarifies the water to improve light transmittance and therefore UV dose throughout the entire water column. Another key factor of UV water treatment is the flow rate\u2014if the flow is too high, water will pass through without sufficient UV exposure. If the flow is too low, heat may build up and damage the UV lamp.<ref>Gadgil, A., 1997, ''Field-testing UV Disinfection of Drinking Water'', Water Engineering Development Center, University of Loughborough, UK: LBNL 40360.</ref>\n\nA disadvantage of UVGI is that while water treated by chlorination is resistant to reinfection (until the chlorine off-gasses), UVGI water is not resistant to reinfection. UVGI water must be transported or delivered in such a way as to avoid reinfection.\n\n==Safety ==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2008}}\nIn UVGI systems the lamps are shielded or are in environments that limit exposure, such as a closed water tank or closed air circulation system, often with interlocks that automatically shut off the UV lamps if the system is opened for access by humans.\n\nFor human beings, skin exposure to germicidal wavelengths of UV light can produce rapid sunburn and [[skin cancer]].<ref name=\"Liverpool, UVGI\" >{{Cite web\n  |title=Ultraviolet germicidal irradiation\n  |publisher=[[University of Liverpool]]\n  |page=3\n  |url=https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/media/livacuk/radiation/pdf/UV_germicidal.pdf\n  |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160806185506/https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/media/livacuk/radiation/pdf/UV_germicidal.pdf\n  |archive-date=2016-08-06\n  |url-status=dead\n}}</ref> Exposure of the eyes to this UV radiation can produce extremely painful inflammation of the [[cornea]] and temporary or permanent [[vision impairment]], up to and including [[blindness]] in some cases.  UV can damage the [[retina]] of the eye.<ref name=\"Liverpool, UVGI\" />\n\nAnother potential danger is the UV production of [[ozone]], which can be harmful to one's health. The US Environmental Protection Agency designated 0.05 [[parts per million]] (ppm) of ozone to be a safe level. Lamps designed to release UVC and higher frequencies are doped so that any UV light below 254&nbsp;nm wavelengths will not be released, to minimize ozone production. A full-spectrum lamp will release all UV wavelengths, and will produce ozone when UVC hits oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) molecules.\n\nUVC radiation is able to break down chemical bonds. This leads to rapid [[polymer degradation|aging]] of plastics, insulation, [[gasket]]s, and other materials. Note that plastics sold to be \"UV-resistant\" are tested only for UVB, as UVC doesn't normally reach the surface of the Earth. When UV is used near plastic, rubber, or insulation, care should be taken to shield these items; metal tape or aluminum foil will suffice.\n\nThe [[American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists]] (ACGIH) Committee on Physical Agents has established a [[threshold limit value]] (TLV) for UVC exposure to avoid such skin and eye injuries among those most susceptible. For 254&nbsp;nm UV, this TLV is 6&nbsp;mJ/cm<sup>2</sup> over an eight-hour period. The TLV function differs by wavelengths because of variable energy and potential for cell damage. This TLV is supported by the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection and is used in setting lamp safety standards by the Illuminating Engineering Society of North America. When the Tuberculosis Ultraviolet Shelter Study was planned, this TLV was interpreted as if eye exposure in rooms was continuous over eight hours and at the highest eye-level irradiance found in the room. In those highly unlikely conditions, a 6.0&nbsp;mJ/cm<sup>2</sup> dose is reached under the ACGIH TLV after just eight hours of continuous exposure to an irradiance of 0.2&nbsp;\u03bcW/cm<sup>2</sup>. Thus, 0.2&nbsp;\u03bcW/cm<sup>2</sup> was widely interpreted as the upper permissible limit of irradiance at eye height.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.americanairandwater.com/uv-facts/UV-Safety-Study.pdf|title=Safety of Upper-Room Ultraviolet Germicidal Air Disinfection for Room Occupants: Results from the Tuberculosis Ultraviolet Shelter Study|last=Nardell|first=Edward|date=January\u2013February 2008|website=UV And People's Health|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n==Uses==\n===Air disinfection===\nUVGI can be used to disinfect air with prolonged exposure. Disinfection is a function of UV intensity and time. For this reason, it is not as effective on moving air, or when the lamp is perpendicular to the flow, as exposure times are dramatically reduced. Air purification UVGI systems can be free-standing units with shielded UV lamps that use a fan to force air past the UV light. Other systems are installed in forced air systems so that the circulation for the premises moves microorganisms past the lamps. Key to this form of sterilization is placement of the UV lamps and a good filtration system to remove the dead microorganisms.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.purifier.org/snapcat/iaq.pdf|title=Environmental Analysis of Indoor Air Pollution|publisher=CaluTech UV Air|accessdate=2006-12-05}}</ref>  For example, forced air systems by design impede line-of-sight, thus creating areas of the environment that will be shaded from the UV light. However, a UV lamp placed at the coils and drain pans of cooling systems will keep microorganisms from forming in these naturally damp places.\n\nASHRAE covers UVGI and its applications in indoor air quality and building maintenance in \"Ultraviolet Lamp Systems\", Chapter 16 of its 2008 Handbook, ''HVAC Systems and Equipment''. Its 2011 Handbook, ''HVAC Applications'', covers \"Ultraviolet air and surface treatment\" in Chapter 60.\n\n===Water disinfection===\n[[Image:Steripen in use.jpg|thumb|right|A portable, battery-powered, low-pressure mercury-vapour discharge lamp for water sterilization.]]\n\nUltraviolet disinfection of water is a purely physical, chemical-free process. Even [[parasite]]s such as ''cryptosporidia'' or ''giardia'', which are extremely resistant to chemical disinfectants, are efficiently reduced. UV can also be used to remove chlorine and chloramine species from water; this process is called [[photolysis]], and requires a higher dose than normal disinfection. The sterilized microorganisms are not removed from the water. UV disinfection does not remove dissolved organics, inorganic compounds or particles in the water.<ref>Harm, W., 1980, ''Biological Effects of Ultraviolet Radiation, International Union of Pure and Applied Biophysics'', Biophysics series, Cambridge University Press.{{pn|date=June 2017}}</ref> The world's largest water disinfection plant treats drinking water for New York city.

However, it was recently discovered that ultraviolet radiation can be somewhat effective for treating the microorganism Cryptosporidium. The findings resulted in the use of UV radiation as a viable method to treat drinking water. Giardia in turn has been shown to be very susceptible to UVC when the tests were based on infectivity rather than excystation.<ref>{{Cite journal | title = Inactivation of Giardia muris by low pressure ultraviolet light | author = Ware, M.

This is in large part because of concerns that reaction of the chlorine with organic compounds in the waste water stream could synthesize potentially toxic and long lasting [[chlorinated organics]] and also because of the [[environmental risk]]s of storing chlorine gas or chlorine containing chemicals.  Individual wastestreams to be treated by UVGI must be tested to ensure that the method will be effective due to potential interferences such as [[suspended solids]], dyes, or other substances that may block or absorb the UV radiation. According to the [[World Health Organization]], \"UV units to treat small batches (1 to several liters) or low flows (1 to several liters per minute) of water at the community level are estimated to have costs of US$20 per megaliter, including the cost of electricity and consumables and the annualized capital cost of the unit.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/dwq/wsh0207/en/index4.html |publisher=WHO |work=Water, sanitation and health |title=Drinking water quality |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081002081406/http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/dwq/wsh0207/en/index4.html |archivedate=2008-10-02 }}</ref>\n\nLarge-scale urban UV [[wastewater treatment]] is performed in cities such as [[Edmonton, Alberta]]. The use of ultraviolet light has now become standard practice in most municipal wastewater treatment processes. Effluent is now starting to be recognized as a valuable resource, not a problem that needs to be dumped. Many wastewater facilities are being renamed as water reclamation facilities, whether the wastewater is discharged into a river, used to irrigate crops, or injected into an aquifer for later recovery. Ultraviolet light is now being used to ensure water is free from harmful organisms.\n\n===Aquarium and pond===\nUltraviolet sterilizers are often used to help control unwanted microorganisms in aquaria and ponds. UV irradiation ensures that  pathogens cannot reproduce, thus decreasing the likelihood of a disease outbreak in an aquarium.\n\nAquarium and pond sterilizers are typically small, with fittings for tubing that allows the water to flow through the sterilizer on its way from a separate external filter or water pump.  Within the sterilizer, water flows as close as possible to the ultraviolet light source. Water pre-filtration is critical as water turbidity lowers UVC penetration.\nMany of the better UV sterilizers have long dwell times and limit the space between the UVC source and the inside wall of the UV sterilizer device.<ref>{{cite web |title=UV sterilization; aquarium and pond |publisher=American Aquarium Products |url=http://www.americanaquariumproducts.com/AquariumUVSterilization.html }}</ref>{{third-party-inline|date=May 2015}}\n\n===Laboratory hygiene===\nUVGI is often used to disinfect equipment such as safety [[goggles]], instruments, [[pipettors]], and other devices.  Lab personnel also disinfect glassware and plasticware this way.  Microbiology laboratories use UVGI to disinfect surfaces inside [[Laminar flow cabinet|biological safety cabinets]] (\"hoods\") between uses.\n\n===Food and beverage protection===\nSince the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] issued a rule in 2001 requiring that virtually all [[Fruit juice|fruit]] and [[vegetable juice]] producers follow [[HACCP]] controls, and mandating a 5-[[log reduction]] in pathogens, UVGI has seen some use in sterilization of juices such as fresh-pressed [[apple cider]].\n\n== Technology ==\n{{see also|Ultraviolet#Artificial_sources}}\n\n===Lamps===\n[[Image:Germicidal Lamp 1.jpg|thumb|right|A 9 W [[germicidal lamp]] in a [[compact fluorescent lamp]] form factor]]\n{{Main article|Germicidal lamp}}\n\nGermicidal UV for disinfection is most typically generated by a [[mercury-vapor lamp]]. Low-pressure mercury vapor has a strong emission line at 254&nbsp;nm, which is within the range of wavelengths that demonstrate strong disinfection effect.  The optimal wavelengths for disinfection are close to 270&nbsp;nm.<ref name=\"epa_lt2\" />{{rp|2\u20136}}\n\nMercury vapor lamps may be categorized as either low pressure (including amalgam) or medium-pressure lamps. Low-pressure UV lamps offer high efficiencies (approx 35% UVC) but lower power, typically 1&nbsp;W/cm power density (power per unit of arc length). Amalgam UV lamps utilize an amalgam to control mercury pressure to allow operation at somewhat higher temperature and power density. They operate at higher temperatures and have a lifetime of up to 16,000 hours. Their efficiency is slightly lower than that of traditional low-pressure lamps (approx 33% UVC output) and power density is approximately 2\u20133&nbsp;W/cm. Medium-pressure UV lamps operate at much higher temperatures, up to about 800 degrees Celsius, and have a polychromatic output spectrum and a high radiation output but lower UVC efficiency of 10% or less. Typical power density is 30&nbsp;W/cm<sup>3</sup> or greater.\n\nDepending on the quartz glass used for the lamp body, low-pressure and amalgam UV emit radiation at 254&nbsp;nm and also at 185&nbsp;nm, which has chemical effects. UV radiation at 185&nbsp;nm is used to generate ozone.\n\nThe UV lamps for water treatment consist of specialized low-pressure mercury-vapor lamps that produce ultraviolet radiation at 254&nbsp;nm, or medium-pressure UV lamps that produce a [[polychromatic]] output from 200&nbsp;nm to visible and infrared energy. The UV lamp never contacts the water; it is either housed in a quartz glass sleeve inside the water chamber or mounted external to the water which flows through the transparent UV tube. Water passing through the flow chamber is exposed to UV rays which are absorbed by suspended solids, such as microorganisms and dirt, in the stream.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Wolfe, R.L. |year=1990 |title=Ultraviolet disinfection of potable water |journal= Environmental Science & Technology|volume=24 |issue=6 |pages=768\u2013773|bibcode=1990EnST...24..768W |doi=10.1021/es00076a001 }}</ref>\n\n=== Light emitting diodes (LEDs) ===\n[[File:UVC LED.jpg|thumb|Compact and versatile options with UVC LEDs]]\nRecent developments in [[Light-emitting diode|LED technology]] have led to commercially available UVC LEDs. UVC LEDs use semiconductors to emit light between 255&nbsp;nm-280&nbsp;nm.<ref name=\"Messina 2015\" /> The wavelength emission is tuneable by adjusting the material of the semiconductor. As of 2019, the electrical-to-UVC conversion efficiency of LEDs was lower than that of mercury lamps. The reduced size of LEDs opens up options for small reactor systems allowing for point-of-use applications and integration into medical devices.<ref name=\"Hessling et al 2016\">{{Cite journal |last=Hessling|first=Martin|last2=Gross|first2=Andrej|last3=Hoenes|first3=Katharina|last4=Rath|first4=Monika|last5=Stangl|first5=Felix|last6=Tritschler|first6=Hanna|last7=Sift|first7=Michael|date=2016-01-27|title=Efficient Disinfection of Tap and Surface Water with Single High Power 285&nbsp;nm LED and Square Quartz Tube|journal=Photonics|language=en|volume=3|issue=1|pages=7|doi=10.3390/photonics3010007}}</ref> Low power consumption of semiconductors introduce UV disinfection systems that utilized small solar cells in remote or Third World applications.<ref name=\"Hessling et al 2016\" />\n\nUVC LEDs don't necessarily last longer than traditional germicidal lamps in terms of hours used, and instead have more-variable engineering characteristics and better tolerance for short-term operation. A UVC LED can achieve a longer installed time than a traditional germicidal lamp in intermittent use.  Likewise, LED degradation increases with heat, while filament and HID lamp output wavelength is dependent on temperature, so engineers can design LEDs of particular size and cost to have higher output and faster degradation or lower output and a slower decline over time.\n\n===Water treatment systems===\nSizing of a UV system is affected by three variables: flow rate, lamp power, and UV transmittance in the water. Manufacturers typically developed sophisticated [[Computational fluid dynamics|Computational Fluid Dynamics]] (CFD) models validated with [[Bioassay#Environmental bioassays|bioassay]] testing. This involves testing the UV reactor's disinfection performance with either [[Bacteriophage MS2|MS2]] or T1 [[bacteriophage]]s at various flow rates, UV transmittance, and power levels in order to develop a regression model for system sizing. For example, this is a requirement for all drinking water systems in the United States per the EPA UV Guidance Manual.<ref name=\"epa_lt2\">{{Cite web |title=Ultraviolet disinfection guidance manual for the final long term 2 enhanced surface water treatment rule |url=http://www.epa.gov/ogwdw000/disinfection/lt2/pdfs/guide_lt2_uvguidance.pdf |accessdate=30 January 2011 |date=November 2006 |publisher=United States Environmental Protection Agency |location=Washington, DC }}</ref>{{rp|5-2}}\n\nThe flow profile is produced from the chamber geometry, flow rate, and particular turbulence model selected. The radiation profile is developed from inputs such as water quality, lamp type (power, germicidal efficiency, spectral output, arc length), and the transmittance and dimension of the quartz sleeve. Proprietary CFD software simulates both the flow and radiation profiles. Once the 3D model of the chamber is built, it is populated with a grid or mesh that comprises thousands of small cubes.\n\nPoints of interest\u2014such as at a bend, on the quartz sleeve surface, or around the wiper mechanism\u2014use a higher resolution mesh, whilst other areas within the reactor use a coarse mesh. Once the mesh is produced, hundreds of thousands of virtual particles are \"fired\" through the chamber. Each particle has several variables of interest associated with it, and the particles are \"harvested\" after the reactor. Discrete phase modeling produces delivered dose, head loss, and other chamber-specific parameters.\n\nWhen the modeling phase is complete, selected systems are validated using a professional third party to provide oversight and to determine how closely the model is able to predict the reality of system performance. System validation uses non-pathogenic surrogates such as MS 2 phage or ''[[Bacillus subtilis]]'' to determine the Reduction Equivalent Dose (RED) ability of the reactors. Most systems are validated to deliver 40&nbsp;mJ/cm<sup>2</sup> within an envelope of flow and transmittance.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}\n\nTo validate effectiveness in drinking-water systems, the method described in the EPA UV Guidance Manual is typically used by the U.S., whilst Europe has adopted Germany's DVGW 294 standard. For wastewater systems, the NWRI/AwwaRF Ultraviolet Disinfection Guidelines for Drinking Water and Water Reuse protocols are typically used, especially in wastewater reuse applications.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Treatment technology report for recycled water |url=http://www.cdph.ca.gov/certlic/drinkingwater/Documents/DWdocuments/treatmenttechnology.pdf |accessdate=30 January 2011 |date=January 2007  |publisher=State Of California Division of Drinking Water and Environmental Management |page={{page needed|date=January 2011}} }}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[HEPA]] filter\n*[[Portable water purification]]\n*[[Sanitation]]\n*[[Sanitation Standard Operating Procedures]]\n*[[Solar water disinfection]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wiktionary|sanitation}}\n* [http://iuva.org/ International Ultraviolet Association]\n\n{{Wastewater}}\n\n[[Category:Radiobiology]]\n[[Category:Ultraviolet radiation]]\n[[Category:Hygiene]]\n[[Category:Waste treatment technology]]\n[[Category:Sterilization (microbiology)]]\n", "name_user": "2405:204:a08e:1635:f5f5:cad1:8c55:a5cb", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eUses)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultraviolet_germicidal_irradiation"}
