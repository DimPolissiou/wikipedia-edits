The crown's trade monopoly was broken early in the seventeenth century, with the crown colluding with the merchant guild for fiscal reasons in circumventing the supposedly closed system.{{sfn|Lynch|1989|pages=10\u201311}} In the seventeenth century, the diversion of silver revenue to pay for European consumer goods and the rising costs of defense of its empire meant that \"tangible benefits of America to Spain were dwindling...at a moment when the costs of empire were climbing sharply.\"{{sfn|Elliott|1989|p=24-25}}\n\nThe Bourbon monarchy attempted to expand the possibilities for trade within the empire, by allowing commerce between all ports in the empire, and took other measures to revive economic activity to the benefit of Spain.

New York: Cambridge University Press 1992, p. 218.</ref> In its former colonies in the Americas, Spanish is the dominant language and Catholicism the main religion, enduring cultural legacies of the Spanish Empire.\n\n== Catholic Monarchs and origins of empire ==\n{{Main|Catholic Monarchs}}\n[[File:Coat of Arms of Queen Isabella of Castile (1492-1504).svg|thumb|Coat of Arms of the Catholic Monarchs]]\n{{Spanish colonial campaigns}}\n\nWith the marriage of the heirs apparent to their respective thrones [[Ferdinand II of Aragon|Ferdinand of Aragon]] and [[Isabella I of Castile|Isabella of Castile]] created a personal union that most scholars view as the foundation of the Spanish monarchy. Their dynastic alliance was important for a number of reasons, ruling jointly over a large aggregation of territories although not in a unitary fashion. They successfully pursued expansion in Iberia in the Christian [[Reconquista|Reconquest]] of the Muslim [[Kingdom of Granada]], completed in 1492. This conquest is often called the \u201cChristian Reconquest\u201d due to the different religions of the ruling class of both kingdoms. Since the Kingdom of Granada was the last moorish kingdom in the peninsula, Valencia-born Pope [[Alexander VI]] gave them the title of the [[Catholic Monarchs]]. However, it is important to realize that the Kingdom of Granada and its surrounding kingdoms had been part of Muslim caliphates for over seven centuries. The term \u201creconquest\u201d perpetrates a false idea that the peninsula somehow belonged to Catholics. In reality, even though religion may have played a part in the conquest, the fact of the matter was that southern expansion was partially motivated by traditional reasons as well, such as wealth and land. However, due to the prioritization of the religious aspect, the term \u201cChristian reconquest\u201d is still used to describe the event. Ferdinand of Aragon was particularly concerned with expansion in France and Italy, as well as conquests in North Africa.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |first=Aram |last=Bethany |title=Monarchs of Spain |encyclopedia=Iberia and the Americas: culture, politics, and history|location=Santa Barbara |publisher=ABC Clio |year=2006 |page= 725}}</ref>\n\nWith the Ottoman Turks controlling the choke points of the overland trade from Asia and the Middle East, both Spain and Portugal sought alternative routes. The [[Kingdom of Portugal]] had an advantage over the rest of Iberian, having earlier retaken territory from the Muslims. Portugal completed Christian reconquest in 1238 and settling the kingdom's boundaries. Portugal then began to seek further overseas expansion, first to the port of [[Ceuta]] (1415) and then by colonizing the Atlantic islands of [[Madeira]] (1418) and the [[Azores]] (1427-1452); it also began voyages down the west coast of Africa in the fifteenth century.<ref>Dutra, Francis A. \"Portuguese Empire\" in {{harvnb|Encyclopedia of Latin American History and Culture|1996|loc=vol. 4, p. 451}}</ref> Its rival Castile laid claim to the [[Canary Islands]] (1402) and retook territory from the Moors in 1462. The Christian rivals, Castile and Portugal, came to formal agreements over the division of new territories in the [[Treaty of Alca\u00e7ovas]] (1479), as well as securing the crown of Castile for Isabella, whose accession was challenged militarily by Portugal.\n\nFollowing the voyage of [[Christopher Columbus]] in 1492 and first major settlement in the [[New World]] in 1493, Portugal and Castile divided the world by the [[Treaty of Tordesillas]] (1494), which gave Portugal Africa and Asia and the Western Hemisphere to Spain.<ref name=\"Burkholder Empire\">Burkholder, Mark A. \"Spanish Empire\" in {{harvnb|Encyclopedia of Latin American History and Culture|1996|loc=vol. 5, p. 167}}</ref> The voyage of [[Christopher Columbus]], a [[Genoa|Genoese]] mariner married to a Portuguese woman in Lisbon, obtained the support of Isabella of Castile, sailing west in 1492, seeking a route to the Indies. Columbus unexpectedly encountered the western hemisphere, populated by peoples he named \"Indians.\" Subsequent voyages and full-scale settlements of Spaniards followed, with gold beginning to flow into Castile's coffers. Managing the expanding empire became an administrative issue. The reign of Ferdinand and Isabella began the professionalization of the apparatus of government in Spain, which led to a demand for men of letters (''letrados'') who were university graduates (''licenciados''), of [[University of Salamanca|Salamanca]], [[University of Valladolid|Valladolid]], [[Complutense University of Madrid|Complutense]] and [[University of Alcal\u00e1|Alcal\u00e1]]. These lawyer-bureaucrats staffed the various councils of state, eventually including the [[Council of the Indies]] and [[Casa de Contrataci\u00f3n]], the two highest bodies in metropolitan Spain for the government of the empire in the New World, as well as royal government in The Indies.\n\n=== Conquest and subsequent colonization of Andalusia ===\n{{unreferenced section|date=February 2020}}\nWhen King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella conquered the Iberian peninsula, they had to implement policies to maintain control of the newly gained territory. To do so, the monarchy implemented a system of encomienda. This iteration of the encomienda system was land based, with tributary and land rights given to different noble families. This eventually led to a large land based aristocracy, a separate ruling class that the crown later tried to eliminate in its overseas colonies. By implementing this method of political organization, the crown was able to implement new forms of private property without completely replacing already existing systems, such as the communal use of resources. \nAfter the military and political conquest, there was an emphasis on religious conquest as well, leading to the creation of the  Spanish Inquisition. Although the Inquisition was technically a part of the Catholic church, the Ferdinand and Isabella formed a separate Spanish Inquisition, which led to mass expulsion of Muslims and Jews from the peninsula. This religious court system was later adopted and transported to the Americas, though they took a less effective role there due to limited jurisdiction and large territories.\n\n=== Campaigns in North Africa ===\n{{See also|European enclaves in North Africa before 1830}}\nWith the Christian reconquest completed in the Iberian peninsula, Spain began trying to take territory in Muslim North Africa. It had conquered [[Melilla]] in 1497, and further expansionism policy in North Africa was developed during the regency of Ferdinand the Catholic in Castile, stimulated by the [[Francisco Jim\u00e9nez de Cisneros|Cardinal Cisneros]]. Several towns and outposts in the North African coast were conquered and occupied by Castile: [[Mers El K\u00e9bir|Mazalquivir]] (1505), [[Pe\u00f1\u00f3n de V\u00e9lez de la Gomera]] (1508), [[Oran]] (1509), [[Algiers]] (1510), [[Bejaia|Bougie]] and [[Tripoli, Libya|Tripoli]] (1510). On the Atlantic coast, Spain took possession of the outpost of [[Santa Cruz de la Mar Peque\u00f1a]] (1476) with support from the [[Canary Islands]], and it was retained until 1525 with the consent of the treaty of Cintra (1509).\n\n=== Navarre and Struggles for Italy ===\n{{See also|Italian Wars}}\n[[File:Elgrancapitantrasbatalladeceri\u00f1ola.jpg|thumb|[[Gonzalo Fern\u00e1ndez de C\u00f3rdoba|El gran capit\u00e1n]] at the [[Battle of Cerignola]].]]\n\nThe Catholic Monarchs had developed a strategy of marriages for their children in order to isolate their long-time enemy: France. The Spanish princesses married the heirs of Portugal, England and the [[House of Habsburg]]. Following the same strategy, the Catholic Monarchs decided to support the Aragonese house of [[Naples]] against [[Charles VIII of France]] in the [[Italian Wars]] beginning in 1494. As [[King of Aragon]], Ferdinand had been involved in the struggle against France and [[Republic of Venice|Venice]] for control of Italy; these conflicts became the center of Ferdinand's foreign policy as king. In these battles, which established the supremacy of the [[Tercio|Spanish Tercios]] in European battlefields, the forces of the kings of Spain acquired a reputation for invincibility that would last until the mid-17th century.\n\nAfter the death of Queen Isabella in 1504, and her exclusion of Ferdinand from a further role in Castile, Ferdinand married [[Germaine de Foix]] in 1505, cementing an alliance with France.

Founded in 1510, the city is the oldest continuously-inhabited European city in the continental Americas.]]\n\nWith the [[Capitulations of Santa Fe]], the [[Crown of Castile]] granted expansive power to [[Christopher Columbus]], including exploration, settlement, political power, and revenues, with sovereignty reserved to the Crown. The first voyage established sovereignty for the crown, and the crown acted on the assumption that Columbus's grandiose assessment of what he found was true, so Spain negotiated the [[Treaty of Tordesillas]] with Portugal to protect their territory on the Spanish side of the line. The crown fairly quickly reassessed its relationship with Columbus and moved to assert more direct crown control over the territory and extinguish his privileges. With that lesson learned, the crown was far more prudent in the specifying the terms of exploration, conquest, and settlement in new areas.\n\nThe pattern in the Caribbean that played out over the larger Spanish Indies was exploration of an unknown area and claim of sovereignty for the crown; conquest of indigenous peoples or assumption of control without direct violence; settlement by Spaniards who were awarded the labour of indigenous people via the [[encomienda]]; and the existing settlements becoming the launch point for further exploration, conquest, and settlement, followed by the establishment institutions with officials appointed by the crown. The patterns set in the Caribbean were replicated throughout the expanding Spanish sphere, so although the importance of the Caribbean quickly faded after the [[Spanish conquest of the Aztec empire]] and the [[Spanish conquest of Peru]], many of those participating in those conquests had started their exploits in the Caribbean.{{sfn|Lockhart|Schwartz|1983|pages=61\u201385}}\n\nThe first permanent European settlements in the New World were established in the Caribbean, initially on the island of [[Hispaniola]], later Cuba and Puerto Rico. As a Genoese with the connections to Portugal, Columbus considered settlement to be on the pattern of trading forts and factories, with salaried employees to trade with locals and to identify exploitable resources.{{sfn|Lockhart|Schwartz|1983|p= 62}} However, Spanish settlement in the New World was based on a pattern of a large, permanent settlements with the entire complex of institutions and material life to replicate Castilian life in a different venue. Columbus's second voyage in 1493 had a large contingent of settlers and goods to accomplish that.{{sfn|Lockhart|Schwartz|1983|p=63}} On Hispaniola, the city of [[Ciudad Colonial (Santo Domingo)|Santo Domingo]] was founded in 1496 by Christopher Columbus's brother [[Bartholomew Columbus]] and became a stone-built, permanent city.\n\n===Assertion of Crown control in the Americas===\nAlthough Columbus staunchly asserted and believed that the lands he encountered were in Asia, the paucity of material wealth and the relative lack of complexity of indigenous society meant that the [[Crown of Castile]] initially was not concerned with the extensive powers granted Columbus. As the Caribbean became a draw for Spanish settlement and as Columbus and his extended Genoese family failed to be recognized as officials worthy of the titles they held, there was unrest among Spanish settlers. The crown began to curtail the expansive powers that they had granted Columbus, first by appointment of royal governors and then a high court or [[Real Audiencia|Audiencia]] in 1511.\n\nColumbus encountered the mainland in 1498,{{sfn|Diego-Fern\u00e1ndez Sotelo|1987|p= 139}} and the Catholic Monarchs learned of his discovery in May 1499. Taking advantage of a revolt against Columbus in [[Hispaniola]], they appointed [[Francisco de Bobadilla]] as governor of the Indies with civil and criminal jurisdiction over the lands discovered by Columbus. Bobadilla, however, was soon replaced by Frey [[Nicol\u00e1s de Ovando]] in September 1501.{{sfn|Diego-Fern\u00e1ndez Sotelo|1987|p=143\u2013145}} Henceforth, the Crown would authorize to individuals voyages to discover territories in the Indies only with previous royal license,{{sfn|Diego-Fern\u00e1ndez Sotelo|1987|p=139}} and after 1503 the monopoly of the Crown was assured by the establishment of ''[[Casa de Contrataci\u00f3n]]'' (House of Trade) at Seville.

Charles was also Holy Roman Emperor via his paternal line and, at his abdication, his son [[Philip II of Spain]] inherited also [[Franche-Comt\u00e9]] and the [[Habsburg Netherlands]], turning these territories into a ''[[Spanish Road]]'' in Western Europe. Philip centralized the administration of the Spanish empire in [[Madrid]], initiating a cultural and political golden age for Spain (known in Spanish as the ''{{lang|es|[[Siglo de Oro]]}}'') while becoming known as the \"Prudent King\", and inherited also the [[Portuguese Empire]] in 1580.\n\nThe Habsburgs pursued several goals:\n* Undermining the power of France and containing it in its eastern borders\n* Defending Europe against [[Islam]], notably the [[Ottoman Empire]] in the [[Ottoman\u2013Habsburg wars]]\n* Maintaining [[House of Habsburg|Habsburg]] [[hegemony]] in the [[Holy Roman Empire]] and defending the [[Roman Catholic Church]] against the [[Protestant Reformation]]\n* Spreading (Catholic) Christianity to the unconverted indigenous of the [[New World]] and the [[Philippines]]\n* Exploiting the resources of the Americas (gold, silver, sugar) and trading with Asia ([[porcelain]], spices, silk)\n* Excluding other European powers from the possessions it claimed in the [[New World]]\n\nSpain came across an imperial reality without finding profits at the beginning. It did stimulate some trade and industry, but the trading opportunities encountered were limited. Therefore, Spain started to invest in America with the creation of cities, because Spain was in America due to religious reasons. Matters began to change in the 1520s with the large-scale extraction of silver from the rich deposits of Mexico's [[Guanajuato]] region, but it was the opening of the silver mines in Mexico's [[Zacatecas]] and [[Potos\u00ed]] in Upper Peru (modern-day Bolivia) in 1546 that became legendary. During the 16th century, Spain held the equivalent of US$1.5 trillion (1990 terms) in gold and silver received from [[New Spain]]. These imports contributed to [[price revolution|inflation]] in Spain and Europe from the last decades of the 16th century. The vast imports of silver also made local manufactures uncompetitive and ultimately made Spain overly dependent on foreign sources of [[raw material]]s and [[manufactured goods]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} \"I learnt a proverb here\", said a French traveler in 1603: \"Everything is dear in Spain except silver\".<ref>Quoted in {{harvnb|Braudel|1984|loc=vol 2., p. 171}}.</ref> The problems caused by inflation were discussed by scholars at the [[School of Salamanca]] and the ''[[arbitrista]]s''.

He was the first Habsburg monarch of Spain and co-ruler of Spain with his mother. Charles had been raised in northern Europe and his interests remained those of Christian Europe. The continuing threat of the Ottoman Turks in the Mediterranean and Central Europe also occupied the monarch. While not directly an inheritance, Charles was elected emperor of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] after the death of his grandfather [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Maximilian]] thanks to prodigious bribes paid to the prince-electors. Charles became the most powerful Christian ruler in Europe, but his Ottoman rival, [[Suleiman the Magnificent]], challenged Charles for primacy in Europe. France made an unprecedented but pragmatic alliance with the Muslim Ottomans against Habsburg political power and the Ottomans assisted German Protestant princes in the religious conflicts tearing Christian unity apart in Northern Europe. Simultaneously, the overseas lands claimed by Spain in the New World proved to be a source of wealth and the crown was able to assert greater control over its overseas possessions in the political and religious spheres than was possible on Iberian peninsula or in Europe. The conquests of the [[Aztec Empire]] and the [[Inca Empire]] brought vast indigenous civilizations into the Spanish Empire and the mineral wealth, particularly silver, were identified and exploited, becoming the economic lifeblood of the crown. Under Charles, Spain and its overseas empire in the Americas became deeply entwined, with the crown enforcing Catholic exclusivity; exercising crown primacy in political rule, unencumbered by claims of an existing aristocracy; and defending its claims against other European powers.{{sfn|Burbank|Cooper|2010|p= 144-45}} In 1558 he abdicated his throne of Spain to his son, [[Philip II of Spain|Philip]], leaving the ongoing conflicts to his heir.\n\n==== Struggles for Italy ====\n{{See also|Italian Wars}}\n[[File:Battle of Pavia.jpg|thumb|[[Battle of Pavia]]]]\n\nWith the ascent of [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles I]] in 1516 and his election as sovereign of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] in 1519, [[Francis I of France]] found himself surrounded by Habsburg territories. He invaded the Imperial possessions in Italy in 1521, inaugurating the [[Italian War of 1521\u20131526|second war]] of the [[French-Habsburg rivalry]]. The war was a disaster for France, which suffered defeat in the [[Battle of Biccoca]] (1522), the [[Battle of Pavia]] (1525), in which Francis I was captured and imprisoned in Madrid,<ref>{{cite book|last1=Presa Gonz\u00e1lez |first1=Fernanado |last2=Grenda |first2=Agnieszka Matyjaszczyk |title=Madrid a los ojos de los viajeros polacos : un siglo de estampas literarias de la Villa y Corte (1850\u20131961) |language=es |date=2003 |publisher=Huerga & Fierro |location=Madrid |isbn=9788483744161|edition=  1st}}</ref> and in the [[Battle of Landriano]] (1529) before Francis relented and abandoned [[Milan]] to the Empire. Charles later gave the imperial fief of Milan to his Spanish son Philip.\n\nThe papacy and Charles had complicated relations. Charles's forces were victorious at the [[Battle of Pavia]] in 1525. [[Pope Clement VII]] switched sides and joined forces with France and prominent Italian states against the Habsburg Emperor, resulting in the [[War of the League of Cognac]]. Charles grew exhausted with the pope's meddling in what he viewed as purely secular affairs. In 1527, Charles's army in northern Italy, underpaid and desiring to plunder the city of Rome, mutinied, advanced southward toward Rome, and looted the city. The [[Sack of Rome (1527)|Sack of Rome]], while unintended by Charles, embarrassed the papacy sufficiently enough that Clement, and succeeding popes, were considerably more circumspect in their dealings with secular authorities.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} In 1533, Clement's refusal to annul the first marriage of King [[Henry VIII of England]] to Charles's aunt, [[Catherine of Aragon]], may have been partly or entirely motivated by his unwillingness to offend the emperor and perhaps have his city sacked for a second time. The [[Peace of Barcelona]], signed between Charles V and the Pope in 1529, established a more cordial relationship between the two leaders. Charles was effectively named the protector of the Catholic cause, and he was crowned as [[King of Italy]] ([[Lombardy]]) by the Medici [[Pope Clement VII]] in return for [[Siege of Florence (1529\u201330)|his intervention]] in overthrowing the rebellious [[Florence|Florentine]] Republic.\n\nThe crowns of Castile and Aragon depended on Genoese bankers for its finances and the Genoese fleet aided the Spanish in fighting the Ottomans in the Mediterranean.{{sfn|Burbank|Cooper|2010|p= 121}}\n\n==== Ottoman Turks during Charles V's rule ====\n\n{{See also|Conquest of Tunis (1535)|Battle of Preveza|Siege of Castelnuovo|Algiers expedition (1541)}}\n[[File:Columnas Plus Ultra.png|thumb|The [[Pillars of Hercules]] with the motto \"[[Plus Ultra (motto)|Plus Ultra]]\" (\"further beyond\") as symbol of the [[Holy Roman Emperor]] [[Charles I of Spain|Charles V]] in the town hall of [[Seville]] (16th century).

They had defeated the eastern Christian Byzantine empire and seized its capital, creating it as the Ottoman capital and the Ottomans controlled a rich area of the eastern Mediterranean, with links to Asia, Egypt, and India and in by the mid-sixteenth century, they ruled a third of Europe. The Ottomans had created an impressive land and maritime empire, with port cities and short and long range trade connections.{{sfn|Burbank|Cooper|2010|p= 132}} Charles's great rival was [[Suleiman the Magnificent]], whose rule almost exactly coincided with Charles's. A contemporary Spanish writer, [[Francisco L\u00f3pez de G\u00f3mara]], compared Charles unfavorably with Suleiman in the 1540s, saying that although both were wealthy and pursued war, \"the Turks succeeded better at fulfilling their projects than did the Spanish; they devoted themselves more fully to the order and discipline of war, they were better advised, they used their money more effectively.\"<ref>quoted in {{harvnb|Burbank|Cooper|2010|p= 119}}</ref>\n\nIn 1535, Charles assembled an invasion force of 60,000 troops and 398 ships from the Habsburg domains, Genoa, Portugal, the Papal States, and the Knights of St. John, and he had this force invade [[Tunis]] in North Africa, from which the Ottomans and their corsairs launched several raids against the Christian states of the Mediterranean. The Habsburgs destroyed the Ottoman fleet in the harbor before besieging the fortress of La Goletta. After the Habsburg forces conquered the city of Tunis, they massacred 30,000 Muslim civilians.\n\n[[Pope Paul III]] assembled a league consisting of the [[Republic of Venice]], the [[Duchy of Mantua]], the Spanish Empire, Portugal, the [[Papal States]], the [[Republic of Genoa]], and the [[Knights of St. John]], but this coalition was defeated at the 1538 [[Battle of Preveza]], and it soon disbanded.\n\nIn 1543, Francis I of France announced his unprecedented alliance with the Islamic sultan of the [[Ottoman Empire]], [[Suleiman the Magnificent]], by occupying the Spanish-controlled [[Siege of Nice|city of Nice]] in concert with Ottoman Turk forces. Henry VIII of England, who bore a greater grudge against France than he held against Charles for standing in the way of his divorce, joined him in his invasion of France. Although the Spanish were defeated at the [[Battle of Ceresole]] in Savoy, the French army was unable to seriously threaten Spanish-controlled Milan, while suffering defeat in the north at the hands of Henry, thereby being forced to accept unfavorable terms. The Austrians, led by Charles's younger brother [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand]], continued to fight the Ottomans in the east.\n\nThe presence of Spain in North Africa declined during Charles's reign, though [[Tunis]] and its port, [[La Goleta]], were taken in 1535. One after another, most of the Spanish possessions were lost: Pe\u00f1\u00f3n de V\u00e9lez de la Gomera (1522), Santa Cruz de Mar Peque\u00f1a (1524), Algiers (1529), Tripoli (1551), Bujia (1554), and La Goleta and Tunis (1569).\n\n==== Religious conflicts in the Holy Roman Empire ====\n{{unreferenced section|date=February 2020}}\n[[File:Habsburg Map 1547.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|Map of the dominion of the [[House of Habsburg|Habsburgs]] following the [[abdication]] of [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] (1556), as depicted in ''The Cambridge Modern History Atlas'' (1912); Habsburg lands are shaded green. From 1556 the lands in a line from the Netherlands, through to the east of France, to the south of Italy and [[Sardinia|the islands]] were retained by the [[Spanish Habsburgs]].]]\n\nThe [[Schmalkaldic League]] had allied itself to the French, and efforts in Germany to undermine the League had been rebuffed. Francis's defeat in 1544 led to the annulment of the alliance with the Protestants, and Charles took advantage of the opportunity. He first tried the path of negotiation at the [[Council of Trent]] in 1545, but the Protestant leadership, feeling betrayed by the stance taken by the Catholics at the council, went to war, led by the [[Saxony|Saxon]] [[Prince-elector|elector]] [[Maurice of Saxony|Maurice]].\n\nIn response, Charles invaded Germany at the head of a mixed Dutch\u2013Spanish army, hoping to restore the Imperial authority. The emperor personally inflicted a decisive defeat on the Protestants at the historic [[Battle of M\u00fchlberg]] in 1547. In 1555, Charles signed the [[Peace of Augsburg]] with the Protestant states and restored stability in Germany on his principle of ''{{lang|la|[[cuius regio, eius religio]]}}'', a position unpopular with Spanish and Italian clergymen. Charles's involvement in Germany would establish a role for Spain as protector of the Catholic, [[Habsburg]] cause in the [[Holy Roman Empire]]; the precedent would lead, seven decades later, to involvement in the war that would decisively end Spain as Europe's leading power.\n\n==== The Indies ====\n{{See also|Fall of Tenochtitlan|Battle of Cajamarca}}\nWhen Charles succeeded to the throne of Spain, Spain's overseas possessions in the New World were based in the Caribbean and the Spanish Main and consisted of a rapidly decreasing indigenous population, few resources of value to the crown, and a sparse Spanish settler population. The situation changed dramatically with the expedition of [[Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s]], who, with alliances with [[altepetl|city-states]] hostile to the [[Aztec Empire|Aztecs]] and thousands of indigenous Mexican warriors, [[Spanish conquest of the Aztec empire|conquered]] the Aztec Empire (1519-1521). Following the pattern established in Spain during the Christian [[Reconquista|reconquest]] of Islamic Spain, and in the Caribbean, the first European settlements in the Americas, conquerors divided up the indigenous population in private holdings ''[[encomienda]]s'' and exploited their labor. Central Mexico and later the Inca Empire of Peru gave Spain vast new indigenous populations to convert to Christianity and rule as vassals of the crown. Charles established the [[Council of the Indies]] in 1524 to oversee all of Castile's overseas possessions. Charles appointed a [[Viceroyalty of New Spain|viceroy in Mexico]] in 1535, capping the royal governance of the high court, ''[[Real Audiencia]]'', and treasury officials with the highest royal official. Following the conquest of Peru, in 1542 Charles likewise appointed a [[Viceroyalty of Peru|viceroy]]. Both officials were under the jurisdiction of the Council of the Indies. Charles promulgated the [[New Laws]] of 1542 to limit the power of the conqueror group to form a hereditary aristocracy that might challenge the power of the crown.\n\n[[File:Pyle pirates approaching ship.jpg|thumb|Pirates attacking a much larger Spanish [[galleon]]]]\n\n=== Philip II (r. 1556-1598) ===\n{{Main|Philip II of Spain}}\n[[File:Philip II portrait by Titian.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Philip II of Spain, Philip I of Portugal, portrait by [[Titian]]]]\nThe reign of [[Philip II of Spain]] was extremely important, with both major successes and failures. Philip was Charles V's only legitimate son. He did not become Holy Roman Emperor, but divided Habsburg possessions with his uncle [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand]]. Philip treated Castile as the foundation of his empire, but the population of Castile was never great enough to provide the soldiers needed to defend the Empire or settlers to populate it. When he married [[Mary I of England|Mary Tudor]], England was allied to Spain. He seized the throne of Portugal in 1580, creating the [[Iberian Union]] and bringing the entire Iberian peninsula under his personal rule.\n\nAccording to one of his biographers, it was entirely due to Philip that the Indies were brought under crown control, remaining Spanish until the wars of independence in the early nineteenth century and Catholic to the present era. His greatest failure was his inability to suppress the Dutch revolt, which was aided by English and French rivals. His militant Catholicism also played a major role in his actions, as did his inability to understand imperial finances. He inherited his father's debts and incurred his own pursuing religious wars, resulting in recurring state bankruptcies and dependence on foreign bankers.{{sfnm|Parker|1978|1p=115-118, 123-124|Archer|2002|2p= 251}} Although there was an enormous expansion of silver production in Peru and Mexico, it did not remain in the Indies or even in Spain itself, but rather much of it went to European merchant houses. Under Philip's rule, learned men, known as ''[[arbitrista]]s'' began writing analyses of this paradox of Spain's impoverishment.\n\n====Ottoman Turks, the Mediterranean, and North Africa during Philip II's rule====\n{{See also|Great Siege of Malta|Battle of Lepanto|Conquest of Tunis (1574)}}\n[[File:Battle of Lepanto 1571.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|The [[Battle of Lepanto (1571)|Battle of Lepanto]] (1571) marked the end of [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] naval supremacy in the Mediterranean Sea.]]\n\nThe first years of his reign, \"from 1558 to 1566, Philip II was concerned principally with Muslim allies of the Turks, based in Tripoli and Algiers, the bases from which North African [Muslim] forces under the corsair [[Dragut]] preyed upon Christian shipping.\"{{sfn|Kamen|2003|p=155}} In 1565, the Spanish defeated an [[List of Ottoman sieges and landings|Ottoman landing]] on the strategic island of [[Malta]], defended by the [[Knights of St. John]]. The death of [[Suleiman the Magnificent]] the following year and his succession by his less capable son [[Selim the Sot]] emboldened Philip, who resolved to carry the war to the sultan himself. In 1571, Spanish and [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] [[warship]]s, joined by volunteers from across Europe led by Charles's natural son [[Don John of Austria]], annihilated the Ottoman fleet at the [[Battle of Lepanto (1571)|Battle of Lepanto]]. The battle ended the threat of Ottoman naval hegemony in the Mediterranean. Following the battle, Philip and the Ottomans concluded truce agreements. The victory was aided by the participation of various military leaders and contingents from parts of Italy under Philip's rule. German soldiers took part in the capture of Pe\u00f1\u00f3n del V\u00e9lez in North Africa in 1564. By 1575, German soldiers were three-quarters of Philip's troops.{{sfn|Kamen|2003|p=166-67}}\n\nThe Ottomans recovered soon. They reconquered Tunis in 1574, and they helped to restore an ally, [[Abu Marwan Abd al-Malik I Saadi]], to the throne of Morocco, in 1576. The death of the Persian shah, [[Tahmasp I]], was an opportunity for the Ottoman sultan to intervene in that country, so he agreed to a truce in the Mediterranean with Philip II in 1580.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=sLD6aT7QfYgC&lpg=PA122&dq=&pg=PA122#v=onepage&q=&f=true The Tempest and Its Travels \u2013 Peter Hulme \u2013 Google Libros].

Lepanto was the decisive turning point in control of the Mediterranean away from centuries of Turkish hegemony. In the western Mediterranean, Philip pursued a defensive policy with the construction of a series of armed garrisons and peace agreements with some of the Muslim rulers of North Africa.{{sfn|Kamen|2003|p=255}}\n\nIn the first half of the 17th century, Spanish ships attacked the Anatolian coast, defeating larger Ottoman fleets at the [[Battle of Cape Celidonia]] and the [[Battle of Cape Corvo]].

Philip aggressively prosecuted the war against France, crushing a French army at the [[Battle of St. Quentin (1557)|Battle of St. Quentin]] in Picardy in 1558 and defeating Henry again at the [[Battle of Gravelines (1558)|Battle of Gravelines]].\nThe [[Peace of Cateau-Cambr\u00e9sis]], signed in 1559, permanently recognized Spanish claims in Italy. In the celebrations that followed the treaty, Henry was killed by a stray splinter from a lance. France was stricken for the next thirty years by chronic civil war and unrest (see [[French Wars of Religion]]) and, during this period, removed it from effectively competing with Spain and the Habsburg family in European power games. Freed from effective French opposition, Spain attained the apogee of its might and territorial reach in the period 1559\u20131643.\n\nThe time for rejoicing in Madrid was short-lived. In 1566, [[Calvinist]]-led riots in the Netherlands prompted the [[Fernando \u00c1lvarez de Toledo, 3rd Duke of Alba|Duke of Alba]] to march into the country to restore order. In 1568, [[William the Silent|William of Orange]], a German nobleman, led a failed attempt to drive Alba from the Netherlands. These battles are generally considered to signal the start of the [[Eighty Years' War]] that ended with the independence of the [[Dutch Republic|United Provinces]] in 1648. The Spanish, who derived a great deal of wealth from the Netherlands and particularly from the vital port of [[Antwerp]], were committed to restoring order and maintaining their hold on the provinces. According to [[Luc-Normand Tellier]], \"It is estimated that the port of Antwerp was earning the Spanish crown seven times more revenues than the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|Americas]].\"<ref>{{citation|title=Urban world history: an economic and geographical perspective|first1=Luc-Normand|last1=Tellier|publisher=PUQ|year=2009|isbn=978-2-7605-1588-8|page=308\n|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cXuCjDbxC1YC}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=cXuCjDbxC1YC&pg=PA308 Extract of page 308]</ref>\n\nFor Spain, the war became an endless quagmire, sometimes literally. In 1574, the Spanish army under [[Francisco de Valdez]] was repulsed from the [[Siege of Leiden]] after the Dutch broke the [[Dyke (construction)|dykes]], thus causing extensive flooding. Alba's son, [[Fadrique \u00c1lvarez de Toledo, 4th Duke of Alba|Fadrique \u00c1lvarez de Toledo]], committed shocking massacres at Zutphen, [[Massacre of Naarden|Naarden]], and Haarlem. In 1576, faced with the bills from his 80,000-man army of occupation in the Netherlands, the cost of his fleet that had won at Lepanto, together with the growing threat of [[piracy]] in the open seas reducing his income from his American colonies, Philip was forced to accept bankruptcy. The army in the Netherlands mutinied not long after, [[Sack of Antwerp|seizing Antwerp]] and looting the southern Netherlands. This \"[[Spanish Fury]]\" was used by William to reinforce his arguments to ally all the Netherlands' Provinces with him. The [[Union of Brussels]] was formed only to be dissolved later out of intolerance towards the religious diversity of its members. Calvinists began their wave of uncontrolled atrocities aimed at the Catholics. This divisiveness gave Spain the opportunity to send [[Alexander Farnese, Duke of Parma|Alexander Farnese]] with 20,000 well-trained troops into the Netherlands. Groningen, Breda, Campen, Dunkirk, Antwerp, and Brussels, among others, were put to siege. In January, 1579, a group of Catholic nobles formed a League for the protection of their religion and property. Later that same month Friesland, Gelderland, Groningen, Holland, Overijssel, Utrecht and Zeeland formed the [[Dutch Republic|United Provinces]] which became the Dutch [[Netherlands]] of today. The remaining provinces became the [[Spanish Netherlands]] and in the 19th century became [[Belgium]]. Farnese soon regained nearly all the Southern provinces for Spain.\n\nFurther north, the city of [[Maastricht]] was besieged on March 12, 1579. Farnese's attackers tunneled an extensive network of passages in order to enter the city beneath its walled defenses. The defenders dug tunnels to meet them. Battles were fought fiercely in caverns with limited maneuvering capabilities. Hundreds of besiegers were scalded or choked to death when boiling water was poured into the tunnels or fires were lit to fill them with smoke.<ref name=\"Durant\">{{cite book |title=The Age of Reason Begins: A History of European Civilization in the Period of Shakespeare, Bacon, Montaigne, Rembrandt, Galileo, and Descartes: 1558\u20131648 |publisher=Simon and Schuster |url=https://archive.org/details/ageofreasonbegin07dura_0|url-access=registration |page=[https://archive.org/details/ageofreasonbegin07dura_0/page/454 454] |isbn = 9780671013202|last1 = Durant|first1 = Will|last2 = Durant|first2 = Ariel|year = 1961}}</ref> In an attempt to mine the city, 500 of Farnese's own men were killed when the explosives detonated prematurely.<ref name=Durant/> It took more than four months but the besiegers finally breached the wall and entered the city at night.

The failure of the expedition depleted the financial resources of England's treasury, which had been carefully restored during the long reign of Elizabeth I.\n\nSpain had invested itself in the religious warfare in France after Henry II's death. In 1589, [[Henry III of France|Henry III]], the last of the [[Valois Dynasty|Valois]] lineage, died at the walls of Paris. His successor, [[Henry IV of France|Henry IV of Navarre]], the first [[Bourbon Dynasty|Bourbon]] king of France, was a man of great ability, winning key victories against the [[Catholic League (French)|Catholic League]] at [[Battle of Arques|Arques]] (1589) and [[Battle of Ivry|Ivry]] (1590). Committed to stopping Henry of Navarre from becoming King of France, the Spanish divided their army in the Netherlands and invaded France, relieving [[Siege of Paris (1590)|Paris]] in 1590 and [[Siege of Rouen (1591)|Rouen]] in 1592.\n\nOn October 25, 1590 the Spanish landed in Nantes ([[Brittany]]). They established as an operational base the port of Blavet. On May 21, 1592 they defeated an Anglo-French army at the [[Battle of Craon]] and, after chasing the English contingent, they completely derailed it in [[Ambri\u00e8res]]. On 6 November of that year they took [[Brest, France|Brest]]. In 1593 the Spanish landed on [[Camaret-sur-Mer|Camaret]] and built \"La Pointe des Espagnols\" (The Tip of the Spaniards) fort in the Crozon peninsula, dominating the entrance to the Brest port. On October 1, an Anglo-French army started a [[Siege of Fort Crozon]], while an English fleet bombarded the place from the sea. The garrison could only hold out until November 15, while the auxiliary army, led by [[Juan del \u00c1guila]], failed to relieve the fort having been blocked at [[Plomodiern]]. On the 19th an assault by the besiegers put the garrison to the sword \u2014 there were only 13 survivors.\n\nThe Spanish decided to organize a punitive expedition against England for helping the French. Thus, on July 26, 1595, three companies of musketeers under the command of Captain [[Carlos de Am\u00e9squita]] sailed in four galleys. They first made landfall in [[Penmarch]] to get supplies. On July 31 they left for England and landed on August 2 in [[Mount's Bay|Mounts Bay]], [[Cornwall]]. In two days the [[Raid on Mount's Bay|expedition]] sacked and burned [[Mousehole]] (where only a pub survived), [[Newlyn]], Paul and [[Penzance]]. They also cleared the heavy artillery of the English and then re-embarked on the galleys. On 5 August, a day after setting sail back to France, they found a Dutch squadron of 46 ships from which they managed to escape but not before sinking two enemy ships. On August 10, Am\u00e9squita and his men landed victoriously in [[Blavet]]. The expedition resulted in 20 casualties, all of them in the skirmish against the Dutch.\n\nIn early June 1595, the Spanish [[List of governors of the Duchy of Milan|governor of Milan]], [[Juan Fern\u00e1ndez de Velasco, 5th Duke of Fr\u00edas|Juan Fern\u00e1ndez de Velasco]], crossed the Alps with an army of 12,000 troops from Italy and Sicily. The Catholic French noble [[Charles, Duke of Mayenne]] joined forces with him at Besan\u00e7on, and the combined Spanish-Catholic League army moved on with the goal of capturing Dijon. King Henry managed to gather 3,000 French troops, and he raced to Troyes to prevent the Spanish from doing so. At the [[Battle of Fontaine-Fran\u00e7aise]] on 5 June 1595, the French surprised the Spanish and forced them to retreat temporarily, and Velasco decided to retreat, thinking that the numerically-inferior French were waiting for reinforcements. The French royal victory there marked the end of the Catholic League. The French also made some progress during an invasion of the Spanish Netherlands, led by [[Henri de La Tour d'Auvergne, Duke of Bouillon]] and [[Fran\u00e7ois d'Orl\u00e9ans-Longueville, duc de Fronsac|Fran\u00e7ois d'Orl\u00e9ans-Longueville]]. The French captured [[Ham, Belgium|Ham]] and massacred the small Spanish garrison, provoking anger among the Spanish ranks. The new Spanish [[List of governors of the Habsburg Netherlands|governor of Flanders]], the [[Pedro Henriquez de Acevedo, Count of Fuentes|Count of Fuentes]], launched a concerted offensive that year, taking [[Siege of Doullens|Doullens]], Cambrai, and [[Siege of Le Catelet (1595)|Le Catelet]]; at Doullens, the Spanish shouted \"Remember Ham\" and massacred everyone in the city (military and civilians alike) in an act of revenge. On April 24, 1596, the Spanish also [[Siege of Calais (1596)|conquered Calais]]. Following the Spanish capture of Amiens in March 1597, King Henry IV laid siege to it until he managed to [[Siege of Amiens (1597)|reconquer Amiens]] from the overstretched Spanish forces in September 1597.\n\nIn 1595, [[Hugh O'Neill, Earl of Tyrone]] and [[Hugh Roe O'Donnell|Hugh O'Donnell]] had fitful Spanish backing when they led an [[Nine Years' War (Ireland)|Irish rebellion]]. In 1601, Spain landed soldiers on the coast of [[County Cork]] in support, but the groups did not rendezvous successfully. Instead, the Spanish were pinned down by the English at the [[Siege of Kinsale]], and they were decisively defeated in 1602.\n\nFaced with wars against France, England and the United Provinces, each led by capable leaders, the bankrupted Spanish empire found itself competing against strong adversaries. Continuing piracy against its shipping in the Atlantic and costly colonial enterprises forced Spain to renegotiate its debts in 1596. Philip had been forced to declare bankruptcy in 1557, 1560, 1575, and 1598.<ref>Burkholder, Suzanne Hiles, \"Philip II of Spain\" in {{harvnb|Encyclopedia of Latin American History and Culture|1996|loc=vol. 4, p. 393-394}}</ref> The crown attempted to reduce its exposure to the conflicts, first signing the [[Treaty of Vervins]] with France in 1598, recognizing [[Henry IV of France|Henry IV]] (since 1593 a Catholic) as king of France, and restoring many of the stipulations of the previous [[Peace of Cateau-Cambr\u00e9sis]].\n\n====The Indies====\n[[File:Capitulo-CIX.jpg|thumb|[[Cerro de Potos\u00ed|Potosi]], discovered in 1545, produced massive amounts of silver from a single site in upper Peru. The first image published in Europe. [[Pedro Cieza de Le\u00f3n]], 1553.]]\n\nUnder Philip II, royal power over The Indies increased, but the crown knew little about its overseas possessions in the Indies. Although the Council of the Indies was tasked with oversight there, it acted without advice of high officials with direct colonial experience. Another serious problem was that the crown did not know what Spanish laws were in force there. To remedy the situation, Philip appointed Juan de Ovando, who was named President of the council, to give advice. Ovando appointed a \"chronicler and cosmographer of the Indies,\" [[:es:Juan L\u00f3pez de Velasco|Juan L\u00f3pez de Velasco]], to gather information about the crown's holdings, which resulted in the [[Relaciones geogr\u00e1ficas]] in the 1580s.{{sfn|Parker|1978|p=113}}\n\n[[File:TupacamaruI.JPG|thumb|left|upright|The last Inca leader, [[T\u00fapac Amaru]] was assassinated in 1572 at the order of the Viceroy [[Francisco de Toledo]].]]\n\nThe crown sought greater control over encomenderos, who had attempted to establish themselves as a local aristocracy; strengthened the power of the ecclesiastical hierarchy; shored up religious orthodoxy by the establishment of the Inquisition in Lima and Mexico City (1571); and increased revenues from silver mines in Peru and in Mexico, discovered in the 1540s. Particularly important was the crown's appointment of two able viceroys, Don [[Francisco de Toledo]] as viceroy of Peru (r. 1569-1581), and in Mexico, [[Mart\u00edn Enr\u00edquez de Almanza|Don Mart\u00edn Enr\u00edquez]] (r. 1568-1580), who was subsequently appointed viceroy to replace Toledo in Peru. In Peru, after decades of political unrest, with ineffective viceroys and encomenderos wielding undue power, weak royal institutions, a renegade Inca state existing in [[Vilcabamba, Peru|Vilcabamba]], and waning revenue from the silver mine of Potos\u00ed, Toledo's appointment was a major step forward for royal control. He built on reforms attempted under earlier viceroys, but he is often credited with a major transformation in crown rule in Peru. Toledo formalized the labor draft of Andean commoners, the [[Mit'a|mita]], to guarantee a labor supply for both the silver mine at [[Cerro Rico|Potos\u00ed]] and the mercury mine at [[Huancavelica]]. He established administrative districts of ''[[corregimiento]]'', and resettled native Andeans in [[reducciones]] to better rule them. Under Toledo, the last stronghold of the Inca state was destroyed and the last Inca emperor, [[Tupac Amaru I]], was executed. Silver from Potos\u00ed flowed to coffers in Spain and paid for Spain's wars in Europe.<ref>Bakewell, Peter, \"Francisco de Toledo\" in {{harvnb|Encyclopedia of Latin American History and Culture|1996|loc=vol. 5, p. 249}}</ref> In Mexico, Viceroy Enr\u00edquez organized the defense of the northern frontier against nomadic and bellicose indigenous groups, who attacked the transport lines of silver from the northern mines.{{sfn|Parker|1978|p=114}} In the religious sphere, the crown sought to bring the power of the religious orders under control with the ''Ordenanza del Patronazgo'', ordering friars to give up their Indian parishes and turn them over to the diocesan clergy, who were more closely controlled by the crown.\n\n[[File:Expedici\u00f3n de Drake y Hawkins 1595-1596.jpg|thumb|Expedition of Drake and Hawkins, 1595\u20131596]]\nThe crown expanded its global claims and defended existing ones in the Indies. Transpacific explorations had resulted in Spain claiming the Philippines and the establishment of Spanish settlements and trade with Mexico. The viceroyalty of Mexico was given jurisdiction over the Philippines, which became the entrep\u00f4t for Asian trade. Philip's succession to the crown of Portugal in 1580 complicated the situation on the ground in the Indies between Spanish and Portuguese settlers, although Brazil and Spanish America were administered through separate councils in Spain. Spain dealt with English encroachment on Spain's maritime control in the Indies, particularly by Sir [[Francis Drake]] and his cousin [[John Hawkins (naval commander)|John Hawkins]]. Drake narrowly escaped with his life when Hawkins' ships were trapped between Spanish galleons and shore batteries at [[Battle of San Juan de Ul\u00faa (1568)|San Juan de Ul\u00faa]] (in present-day Mexico). In January 1586, with [[Martin Frobisher]], Drake led a party ashore to sack [[Battle of Santo Domingo (1586)|Santo Domingo]] in Hispaniola, and he looted [[Battle of Cartagena de Indias (1586)|Cartagena de Indias]] several weeks later. The Spanish defeated the fleet of Drake and Hawkins in 1595 in [[Battle of San Juan (1595)|San Juan, Puerto Rico]] and Cartagena de Indias (Colombia). Spain regained control in the Isthmus of Panama by relocating the main port there from [[Nombre de Dios, Col\u00f3n|Nombre de Dios]] to [[Portobelo]].<ref>Pattridge, Blake D. \"Francis Drake\" in {{harvnb|Encyclopedia of Latin American History and Culture|1996|loc=vol. 2, p. 406}}</ref>\n\n====The Philippines, the Sultanate of Brunei and Southeast Asia====\n{{main|History of the Philippines (1521\u20131898)}}\n{{See also|Castilian War|Cambodian\u2013Spanish War|Spanish\u2013Moro conflict}}\n[[File:Manila Cathedral (1792) by Brambila.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|Manila Cathedral (1792)]]\n\nWith the conquest and settlement of the Philippines, the Spanish Empire reached its greatest extent.{{sfn|Kamen|2003|p=154}} In 1564, [[Miguel L\u00f3pez de Legazpi]] was commissioned by the [[viceroy of New Spain]] (Mexico), Don [[Luis de Velasco]], to lead an expedition in the Pacific Ocean to find the [[Maluku Islands|Spice Islands]], where earlier explorers [[Ferdinand Magellan]] and [[Ruy L\u00f3pez de Villalobos]] had landed in 1521 and 1543, respectively. The westward sailing to reach the sources of spices continued to be a necessity with the Ottomans still controlled major choke points in central Asia. It was unclear how the agreement between Spain and Portugal dividing the Atlantic world affected finds on the other side of the Pacific. Spain had ceded its rights to the \"Spice Islands\" to Portugal in the [[Treaty of Saragossa]] in 1529, but the appellation was vague as was their exact delineation. The Legazpi expedition was ordered by King Philip II, after whom the [[Philippines]] had earlier been named by Ruy L\u00f3pez de Villalobos, when Philip was heir to the throne. The king stated that \"the main purpose of this expediiton is to establish the return route from the western isles, since it is already known that the route to them is fairly short.\"<ref>quoted in {{harvnb|Kamen|2003|p= 201}}</ref> The viceroy died in July 1564, but the [[Audiencia Real|Audiencia]] and L\u00f3pez de Legazpi completed the preparations for the expedition. On embarking on the expedition, Spain lacked maps or information to guide the king's decision to authorize the expedition. That realization subsequently led to the creation of reports from the various regions of the empire, the [[relaciones geogr\u00e1ficas]].{{sfn|Kamen|2003|p=160}} The Philippines came under the jurisdiction of the viceroyalty of Mexico, and once the [[Manila Galleon]] sailings between Manila and Acapulco were established, Mexico became the Philippines' link to the larger Spanish Empire.\n\nSpanish colonization began in earnest when L\u00f3pez de Legazpi arrived from Mexico in 1565 and formed the first settlements in [[Cebu]]. Beginning with just five ships and five hundred men accompanied by Augustinian friars, and further strengthened in 1567 by two hundred soldiers, he was able to repel the Portuguese and create the foundations for the colonization of the archipelago. In 1571, the Spanish, their Mexican recruits and their Filipino (Visayan) allies attacked and occupied [[Kingdom of Maynila|Maynila]], a vassal-state of the [[Sultanate of Brunei]], and negotiated the incorporation of the [[Kingdom of Tondo]] which was liberated from the Bruneian Sultanate's control and of whom, their princess, Gandarapa, had a tragic romance with the Mexican-born Conquistador and grandson of Miguel Lopez de Legazpi, [[Juan de Salcedo]]. The combined Spanish-Mexican-Filipino forces also built a Christian walled city over the burnt ruins of Muslim Maynila and made it as the new capital of the [[Spanish East Indies]] and renamed it [[Manila]].{{sfnm|Kurlansky|1999|1p=64|Joaquin|1988}} Spaniards were few and life was difficult and they were often outnumbered by their Latino recruits and Filipino allies. They attempted to mobilize subordinated populations through the [[encomienda]]. Unlike in the Caribbean where the indigenous populations rapidly disappeared, the indigenous populations continued to be robust in the Philippines.{{sfn|Kamen|2003|p=203}} One Spaniard described the climate as \"cuarto meses de polvo, cuartro meses de lodo, y cuartro meses de todo\" (four months of dust, four months of mud, and four months of everything).<ref>quoted in {{cite book |first=Nicholas P. |last=Cushner |title=Spain in the Philippines |location=Quezon City |year=1971 |page=4 |publisher=Ateneo de Manila University}}</ref>\n\nLegazpi built a fort in Manila and made overtures of friendship to [[Lakan Dula]], Lakan of Tondo, who accepted. Maynila's former ruler, the Muslim rajah, [[Rajah Sulayman]], who was a vassal to the Sultan of Brunei, refused to submit to Legazpi but failed to get the support of Lakan Dula or of the Pampangan and Pangasinan settlements to the north. When [[Tarik Sulayman]] and a force of Kapampangan and Tagalog Muslim warriors attacked the Spaniards in the [[Battle of Bangkusay Channel|battle of Bangkusay]], he was finally defeated and killed. The Spanish also repelled an attack by Chinese pirate warlord [[Limahong]]. Simultaneously, the establishment of a Christianized Philippines attracted Chinese traders who exchanged their silk for Mexican silver, Indian and Malay traders also settled in the Philippines too, to trade their spices and gems for the same Mexican silver. The Philippines then became a center for Christian missionary activity that was also directed to Japan and the Philippines even accepted Christian converts from Japan after the Shogun persecuted them. Most of the soldiers and settlers sent by the Spanish to the Philippines were either from Mexico or Peru and very little people directly came from Spain.\n\nIn 1578, the [[Castilian War]] erupted between the Christian Spaniards and Muslim Bruneians over control of the Philippine archipelago. The Spanish were joined by the newly Christianized Non-Muslim Visayans of the [[Madja-as|Kedatuan of Madja-as]] who were Animists and [[Rajahnate of Cebu]] who were Hindus, plus the [[Rajahnate of Butuan]] (who were from northern Mindanao and were Hindus with a Buddhist Monarchy), as well as the remnants of the Kedatuan of Dapitan who are also Animists and had previously waged war against the Islamic nations of the [[Sultanate of Sulu]] and [[Kingdom of Maynila]]. They fought against the [[Sultanate of Brunei]] and its allies, the Bruneian puppet-states of Maynila and Sulu, which had dynastic links with Brunei. The Spanish, its Mexican recruits and Filipino allies assaulted Brunei and seized its capital, [[Kota Batu, Brunei-Muara|Kota Batu]]. This was achieved partly as a result of the assistance of two [[Pengiran#Brunei|noblemen]], Pengiran Seri Lela and Pengiran Seri Ratna. The former had traveled to Manila to offer Brunei as a [[vassal kingdom|tributary]] of Spain for help to recover the throne usurped by his brother, Saiful Rijal.{{sfn|Alip|1964|pp=201, 317}} The Spanish agreed that if they succeeded in conquering Brunei, Pengiran Seri Lela would indeed become the Sultan, while Pengiran Seri Ratna would be the new [[Bendahara]].

He established the [[Council of Portugal]], on the pattern of the [[Polysynodial System|royal councils]], the [[Council of Castile]], [[Council of Aragon]], and [[Council of the Indies]], that oversaw particular jurisdictions, but all under the same monarch. In Portugal, the Duke of Alba and the Spanish occupation were little more popular in [[Lisbon]] than in [[Rotterdam]]. The combined Spanish and Portuguese empires placed into Philip's hands included almost the entirety of the explored New World along with a vast trading empire in Africa and Asia. In 1582, when Philip II moved his court back to Madrid from the Atlantic port of Lisbon, where he had temporarily settled to pacify his new Portuguese kingdom, the pattern was sealed, in spite of what every observant commentator privately noted. \"Sea power is more important to the ruler of Spain than any other prince\", wrote one commentator, \"for it is only by sea power that a single community can be created out of so many so far apart.\" A writer on tactics in 1638 observed, \"The might most suited to the arms of Spain is that which is placed on the seas, but this matter of state is so well known that I should not discuss it, even if I thought it opportune to do so.\"<ref>Quoted in {{harvnb|Braudel|1984}}{{Specify|date=October 2008}}</ref> Portugal and her kingdoms, including Brazil and her African colonies, were under the dominion of the Spanish monarch.\n\n[[File:Expedici\u00f3n de Francis Drake 1585-1586.jpg|thumb|left|Sir Francis Drake's voyage, 1585\u201386]]\n\nPortugal required an extensive occupation force to keep it under control, and Spain was still reeling from the 1576 bankruptcy. In 1584, William the Silent was assassinated by a half-deranged Catholic, and the death of the popular Dutch resistance leader was hoped to bring an end to the war but did not. In 1585, Queen [[Elizabeth I of England]] sent support to the Protestant causes in the Netherlands and France, and [[Sir Francis Drake]] launched attacks against Spanish merchants in the Caribbean and the Pacific, along with a particularly aggressive attack on the port of [[Cadiz]].\n\nPortugal was brought into Spain's conflicts with rivals. In 1588, hoping to put a stop to Elizabeth's intervention, Philip sent the [[Spanish Armada]] to invade England. Unfavorable weather, plus heavily armed and man\u0153uvrable English ships, and the fact that the English had been warned by their spies in the Netherlands and were ready for the attack resulted in a defeat for the Armada. However, the failure of the [[English Armada|Drake\u2013Norris Expedition]] to Portugal and the Azores in 1589 marked a turning point in the on-off 1585\u20131604 [[Anglo-Spanish War (1585\u20131604)|Anglo\u2013Spanish War]]. The Spanish fleets became more effective in transporting greatly increased quantities of silver and gold from the Americas, while English attacks suffered costly failures.\n\nDuring the reign of Philip IV (Philip III of Portugal) in 1640, the Portuguese revolted and fought for their independence from the rest of Iberia. The Council of Portugal was subsequently dissolved.\n\n=== Philip III (r. 1598-1621) ===\n{{Main|Philip III of Spain}}\n[[File:Felipe3-Spain.jpg|thumb|upright|Philip III of Spain, Philip II of Portugal]]\nPhilip II's successor, [[Philip III of Spain|Philip III]], made chief minister the capable [[Francisco Gom\u00e9z de Sandoval y Rojas, Duke of Lerma]] as a [[favourite]], the first of the ''validos'' ('most worthy').

The [[Kingdom of England]], suffering from a series of repulses at sea and from [[Nine Years' War (Ireland)|a guerrilla war]] by Catholics in Ireland, who were supported by Spain, agreed to the [[Treaty of London, 1604]], following the accession of the more tractable [[House of Stuart|Stuart]] King [[James I of England|James I]].

In 1609, the great majority of the [[Morisco]] population of Spain (much more numerous and unassimilated in the kingdoms of [[Valencia]] and [[Aragon]], than in the [[Crown of Castile]] or the [[Principality of Catalonia]]) was expelled. It is estimated that [[Crown of Castile|Castile]] lost about 25% of its population between 1600 and 1623. Such a dramatic drop in the population meant the basis for the Crown's revenues was dangerously weakened in a time when it was engaged in continuous conflict in Europe.<ref>For a general account, see {{harvnb|Kennedy|2017|pp=40\u201393}}</ref>\n\nPeace with England and France gave Spain an opportunity to focus its energies on restoring its rule to the Dutch provinces. The Dutch, led by [[Maurice of Nassau]], the son of William the Silent and perhaps the greatest strategist of his time, had succeeded in taking a number of border cities since 1590, including the fortress of [[Breda (Netherlands)|Breda]]. However, the Genoese nobleman [[Ambrogio Spinola, 1st Marquess of Balbases|Ambrogio Spinola]], commanding an army of mercenary Italian troops, fought in the name of Spain and repeatedly defeated the Dutchmen. He was prevented from conquering the Netherlands only by Spain's latest [[Insolvency|bankruptcy]] in 1607. In 1609, the [[Twelve Years' Truce]] was signed between Spain and the [[Dutch Republic|United Provinces]]. At last, Spain was at peace \u2013 the ''{{lang|la|[[Pax Hispanica]]}}''.\n\nSpain made a fair recovery during the truce, putting its finances in order and doing much to restore its prestige and stability in the run-up to the last truly great war in which she would play a leading part. The Duke of Lerma (and to a large extent Philip II) had been uninterested in the affairs of their ally, Austria. In 1618, the king replaced him with Don [[Baltasar de Z\u00fa\u00f1iga]], a veteran ambassador to [[Vienna]]. Don Balthasar believed that the key to restraining the resurgent French and eliminating the Dutch was a closer alliance with [[Habsburg Monarchy]]. In 1618, beginning with the [[Defenestration of Prague]], Austria and the [[Holy Roman Emperor]], [[Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand II]], embarked on a campaign against the [[Protestant Union]] and [[Bohemia]]. Don Balthasar encouraged Philip to join the Austrian Habsburgs in the war, and Spinola, the rising star of the Spanish army in the Netherlands, was sent at the head of the [[Army of Flanders]] to intervene. Thus, Spain entered into the [[Thirty Years' War]].\n\n=== Philip IV (r. 1621-1665)===\n{{Main|Philip IV of Spain}}\n\nWhen Philip IV succeeded his father in 1621, Spain was clearly in economic and political decline, a source of consternation. The learned ''[[arbitrista]]s'' sent the king more analyses of Spain's problems and possible solutions. As an illustration of the precarious economic situation of Spain at the time, it was actually Dutch bankers who financed the [[East Indies|East India]] merchants of [[Seville]]. At the same time, everywhere in the world Dutch entrepreneurship and settlements were undermining Spanish and Portuguese [[hegemony]]. The Dutch were religiously tolerant and not evangelical, focusing on trade, as opposed to Spain's longstanding defense of Catholicism. A Dutch proverb says, \"Christ is good; trade is better!\"<ref name=\"non-spanish caribbean\" />\n\n[[File:Vel\u00e1zquez - de Breda o Las Lanzas (Museo del Prado, 1634-35).jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|The Surrender of [[Breda (Netherlands)|Breda]] (1625) to [[Ambrogio Spinola]], by [[Diego Vel\u00e1zquez|Vel\u00e1zquez]]. This victory came to symbolize the renewed period of Spanish military vigor in the [[Thirty Years' War]].]]\n\nSpain badly needed time and peace to repair its finances and to rebuild its economy. In 1622, Don Balthasar was replaced by [[Gaspar de Guzm\u00e1n, Count-Duke of Olivares]], a reasonably honest and able man.{{sfn|Elliott|1986}} After certain initial setbacks, the Bohemians were defeated at [[Battle of White Mountain|White Mountain]] in 1621, and again at [[Battle of Stadtlohn|Stadtlohn]] in 1623. The war with the Netherlands was renewed in 1621 with Spinola taking the fortress of [[Siege of Breda (1624)|Breda]] in 1625. The intervention of [[Christian IV of Denmark]] in the war threatened the Spanish position, but the victory of the Imperial general [[Albert of Wallenstein]] over the Danes at [[Battle of Dessau Bridge|Dessau Bridge]] and again at [[Battle of Lutter|Lutter]] (both in 1626), eliminated that threat.\n\nThere was hope in Madrid that the Netherlands might finally be reincorporated into the Empire, and after the defeat of Denmark the Protestants in Germany seemed crushed. France was once again involved in its own instabilities (the [[Siege of La Rochelle]] began in 1627), and Spain's eminence seemed clear. The Count-Duke Olivares asserted, \"God is Spanish and fights for our nation these days\".<ref>{{harvnb|Brown|Elliott|1980|p=190}}</ref>\n\nOlivares realized that Spain needed to reform, and to reform it needed peace, first and foremost with the Dutch United Provinces. Olivares aimed for \"peace with honor\", however, which meant in practice a peace settlement that would have restored to Spain something of its predominant position in the Netherlands. This was unacceptable to the United Provinces, and the inevitable consequence was the constant hope that one more victory would finally lead to \"peace with honor\", perpetuating the ruinous war that Olivares had wanted to avoid to begin with. In 1625, Olivares proposed the [[Union of Arms]], which aimed at raising revenues from the Indies and other kingdoms of Iberia for imperial defense, which met strong opposition.<ref>Andrien, Kenneth J. \"Uni\u00f3n de Armas\" in {{harvnb|Encyclopedia of Latin American History and Culture|1996|loc=vol. 5, p. 293}}</ref>{{sfn|Elliott|1986|pp=244-277}} The Union of Arms was the sparking point for a major revolt in Catalonia in 1640. This turmoil also seemed a propitious moment for the Portuguese to revolt against Habsburg rule, with the Duke of Braganza proclaimed as [[John IV of Portugal]].<ref>Burkholder, Suzanne Hiles. \"Philip IV of Spain\" in {{harvnb|Encyclopedia of Latin American History and Culture|1996|loc=vol. 4, p. 394}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Philip IV of Spain - Vel\u00e1zquez 1644.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Philip IV of Spain, Philip III of Portugal]]\n[[File:Vicente Carducho, Socorro de la plaza de Constanza..jpg|thumb|left|Victory of the Spanish troops led by the [[G\u00f3mez Su\u00e1rez de Figueroa, 3rd Duke of Feria|Duke of Feria]], at the city of [[Konstanz]], during the Thirty Years' War, 1633. Oil on canvas by Vicente Carducho, 1634.]]\n\nWhile Spinola and the Spanish army were focused on the Netherlands, the war seemed to go in Spain's favor. But in 1627 the Castilian economy collapsed. The Habsburg had been [[debasement|debasing]] their currency to pay for the war and [[inflation|prices exploded]], just as they had in previous years in Austria. Until 1631, parts of Castile operated on a [[barter]] economy owing to the currency crisis, and the government was unable to collect any meaningful taxes from the peasantry and had to depend on revenue from its colonies. The Spanish armies, like others in German territories, resorted to \"paying themselves\" on the land.\n\nOlivares had backed certain taxation reforms in Spain pending the end of the war, but was blamed for another embarrassing and fruitless [[War of the Mantuan Succession|war in Italy]]. The Dutch, who during the Twelve Years' Truce had made increasing their navy a priority, (which showed its maturing potency at the [[Battle of Gibraltar (1607)|Battle of Gibraltar]] 1607), managed to strike a great blow against Spanish maritime trade with the [[Battle in the Bay of Matanzas|capture]] by captain [[Piet Pieterszoon Hein|Piet Hein]] of the [[Spanish treasure fleet]] on which Spain had become dependent after the economic collapse.\n\nSpanish military resources were stretched across Europe and also at sea as they sought to protect maritime trade against the greatly improved Dutch and French fleets, while still occupied with the Ottoman and associated [[Barbary pirate]] threat in the Mediterranean. In the meantime the aim of choking Dutch shipping was carried out by the [[Dunkirkers]] with considerable success. In 1625 a Spanish-Portuguese fleet, under Admiral [[Fadrique de Toledo, 1st Marquis of Villanueva de Valdueza|Fadrique de Toledo]], regained the strategically vital Brazilian city of [[Salvador da Bahia]] from the Dutch. Elsewhere, the isolated and undermanned Portuguese forts in Africa and the Asia proved vulnerable to Dutch and English raids and takeovers or simply being bypassed as important trading posts.\n\nIn 1630, [[Gustavus Adolphus]] of Sweden, one of history's most noted commanders, landed in Germany and relieved the port of [[Stralsund]], the last continental stronghold of German forces belligerent to the Emperor. Gustavus then marched south and won notable victories at [[Battle of Breitenfeld (1631)|Breitenfeld]] and [[Battle of L\u00fctzen (1632)|L\u00fctzen]], attracting more Protestant support with every step he took. By now Spain was deeply involved in saving their Austrian allies from the Swedes who had continued to be wildly successful despite the death of Gustavus at L\u00fctzen in 1632. In early September 1634, a Spanish army that had marched from Italy linked with the Imperials at the town of [[N\u00f6rdlingen]], bringing their total to 33,000 troops. Having severely underestimated the number of experienced Spanish soldiers in the reinforcements, the commanders of the Protestant armies of the [[Heilbronn League]] decided to offer battle. The seasoned Spanish infantry \u2014 which had not been present at any of the battles that had ended in Swedish victories \u2014 was mostly responsible for the [[Battle of N\u00f6rdlingen (1634)|complete rout of the enemy army]], which lost 21,000 casualties out of 25,000 men (to only 3,500 for the Catholics).\n\n[[File:Westfaelischer Friede in Muenster (Gerard Terborch 1648).jpg|thumb|''The swearing of the oath of ratification of the Treaty of M\u00fcnster in 1648'' (1648) that ended the [[Eighty Years' War]] between Spain and the Netherlands. [[Gerard ter Borch]]]]\n\nAlarmed by the Spanish success at N\u00f6rdlingen and the probable collapse of the Swedish military effort [[Cardinal Richelieu]], the chief minister of [[Louis XIII]], realised that it would be necessary to turn the existing cold war into a hot one if Spain, in conjunction with the Austrian Habsburgs was to be stopped from dominating Europe.  The French won the [[Battle of Les Avins]] in Belgium on 20 May 1635, an early success, but the Spanish defeated a joint [[Siege of Leuven|Franco-Dutch invasion]] of the Spanish Netherlands before Spanish and Imperial armies cut through Picardy, Burgundy, and Champagne. However, the Spanish offensive stalled before Paris could be targeted, and the French launched counterattacks that drove the Spanish back into Flanders.\n\nAt the [[Battle of the Downs]] in 1639 a Spanish fleet carrying troops was destroyed off the English coast, and the Spanish found themselves unable to supply and reinforce their forces adequately in the Netherlands. The [[Army of Flanders]], which represented the finest of Spanish soldiery and leadership, faced a French assault led by [[Louis II de Bourbon, Prince de Cond\u00e9]] in northern France at [[Battle of Rocroi|Rocroi]] in 1643. The Spanish, led by [[Francisco de Melo]], were beaten by the French. After a closely fought battle the Spanish were forced to surrender on honorable terms. As a result, while the defeat was not a rout, the high status of the Army of Flanders was ended at Rocroi. The defeat at Rocroi also led to the dismissal of the embattled Olivares, who was confined to his estates by the king's order and died two years later. The [[Peace of Westphalia]] ended the Spanish [[Eighty Years' War]] in 1648, with Spain recognizing the independence of the Seven United Provinces of the Netherlands.\n\nIn 1640, Spain had already experienced the loss of Portugal, following its revolt against Spanish rule, and brought to an end the Iberian Union, and the establishment of the [[House of Braganza]]under king [[John IV of Portugal]]. He had received widespread support from the Portuguese people, and Spain was unable to respond, since it was at war with France and Catalonia revolted that year. with the war against France. Spain and Portugal co-existed in a ''de facto'' state of peace from 1644 to 1656. When John died in 1656, the Spanish attempted to wrest Portugal from his son [[Alfonso VI of Portugal]] but were defeated at [[Battle of Ameixial|Ameixial]] (1663) and [[Battle of Montes Claros|Montes Claros]] (1665), leading to Spain's recognition of Portugal's independence in 1668, during the regency of Philip IV's young heir, Charles II, who was seven at the time.\n\n[[File:Traite-Pyrenees.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|The meeting of [[Philip IV of Spain]] and [[Louis XIV]] of France on 7 July 1660 at [[Pheasant Island]]]]\n\n[[Franco-Spanish War (1635\u201359)|War with France]] continued for eleven more years. Although France suffered from a civil war from 1648 to 1652 (''see [[Fronde|Wars of the Fronde]]''), Spain had been exhausted by the Thirty Years' War and the ongoing revolts. With the war against the United Provinces at an end in 1648, the Spanish drove the French out of Naples and Catalonia in 1652, recaptured Dunkirk, and occupied several northern French forts that they held until peace was made. The war came to an end soon after the [[Battle of the Dunes (1658)]], where the French army under [[Henri de la Tour d'Auvergne, Vicomte de Turenne|Viscount Turenne]] retook Dunkirk. Spain agreed to the [[Peace of the Pyrenees]] in 1659 that ceded to France the Spanish Netherlands territory of [[Artois]] and the northern Catalan county of [[Roussillon]]. Some 200,000\u2013300,000 French were killed or wounded in the struggle against Spain from 1635 to 1659.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Wilson |first1=Peter H. |title=Europe's Tragedy: A New History of the Thirty Years War}}</ref>\n\nFrance was now the dominant power on continental Europe, and the United Provinces were dominant in the Atlantic.

Altogether Spain was thought to have lost 500,000 people, out of a population of slightly fewer than 10,000,000, or nearly 5% of its entire population.

Charles became monarch in 1665 when he was four years old, so a regency of his mother and a five-member government junta ruled in his name, headed by his natural half-brother [[John of Austria]]. Under the regency, [[Louis XIV of France]] prosecuted the [[War of Devolution]] against the [[Spanish Netherlands]] in 1667\u201368, losing considerable prestige and territory, including the cities of [[Lille]] and [[Charleroi]]. In the [[Franco-Dutch War]] of 1672\u20131678, Spain lost still more territory when it came to the assistance of its former Dutch enemies, most notably [[Franche-Comt\u00e9]].\n\nIn the [[Nine Years' War]] (1688\u20131697) Louis XIV once again invaded the Spanish Netherlands. French forces led by the [[Fran\u00e7ois Henri de Montmorency-Bouteville, duc de Luxembourg|Duke of Luxembourg]] defeated the Spanish at [[Battle of Fleurus (1690)|Fleurus]] (1690) and subsequently defeated Dutch forces under [[William III of England|William III of Orange]], who fought on Spain's side. The war ended with most of the Spanish Netherlands under French occupation, including the important cities of [[Ghent]] and [[Luxembourg]]. The war revealed to Europe the vulnerability of the Spanish defenses and bureaucracy. Further, the ineffective Spanish Habsburg government took no action to improve them.\n\nSpain suffered utter decay and stagnation during the final decades of the seventeenth century. While the rest of Western Europe went through exciting changes in government and society \u2013 the [[Glorious Revolution]] in England and the reign of the [[Louis XIV of France|Sun King]] in France \u2013 Spain remained adrift. The Spanish bureaucracy that had built up around the charismatic, industrious, and intelligent [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles I]] and [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]] demanded a strong and hardworking monarch; the weakness and lack of interest of [[Philip III of Spain|Philip III]] and [[Philip IV of Spain|Philip IV]] contributed to Spain's decay. [[Charles II of Spain|Charles II]] was childless and weak ruler, known as \"The Bewitched.\" In his last will and testament he left his throne to a French prince, the [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon]] [[Philip V of Spain|Philip of Anjou]], rather than to another Habsburg. This resulted in the [[War of the Spanish Succession]], with the Austrian Habsburg and the British challenging Charles II's choice of a Bourbon prince to succeed him as king.\n\n== Spanish America ==\n{{Main|Spanish colonization of the Americas}}\n{{see|Criollo people#Spanish colonial caste system{{!}}Society of the Spanish-Americans in the Spanish Colonial Americas}}\nTo the end of its imperial rule, Spain called its overseas possessions in the Americas and the Philippines \"The Indies,\" an enduring remnant of Columbus's notion that he had reached Asia by sailing west. When these territories reach a high level of importance, the crown established the [[Council of the Indies]] in 1524, following the [[Spanish conquest of the Aztec empire|conquest of the Aztec empire]], asserting permanent royal control over its possessions. Regions with dense indigenous populations and sources of mineral wealth attracting Spanish settlers became colonial centers, while those without such resources were peripheral to crown interest.

The Spanish forces, in addition to significant armament and equestrian advantages, exploited the rivalries between competing [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous peoples]], tribes, and nations, some of which were willing to form alliances with the Spanish in order to defeat their more-powerful enemies, such as the [[Aztec Empire|Aztecs]] or [[Inca Empire|Incas]]\u2014a [[divide and rule|tactic]] that would be extensively used by later European colonial powers.

The [[Basques|Basque]] commander [[Juan Sebasti\u00e1n Elcano]] led the expedition to success. Spain sought to enforce their rights in the [[Maluku Islands|Moluccan islands]], which led a conflict with the Portuguese, but the issue was resolved with the [[Treaty of Zaragoza]] (1525), settling the location of the [[antimeridian]] of Tordesillas, which would divide the world into two equal [[Sphere|hemispheres]]. From then on, maritime expeditions led to the discovery of several archipelagos in the South Pacific as the [[Pitcairn Islands]], the [[Marquesas Islands|Marquesas]], [[Tuvalu]], [[Vanuatu]], the [[Solomon Islands]] or [[New Guinea]], to which Spain laid claim.\n\nMost important in Pacific exploration was the claim on the [[Philippines]], which was populous and strategically located for the Spanish settlement of Manila and entrep\u00f4t for trade with China. On 27 April 1565, the first permanent Spanish settlement in the [[Philippines]] was founded by [[Miguel L\u00f3pez de Legazpi]] and the service of [[Manila Galleon]]s was inaugurated. The Manila Galleons shipped goods from all over Asia across the Pacific to [[Acapulco]] on the coast of Mexico. From there, the goods were transshipped across Mexico to the [[Spanish treasure fleet]]s, for shipment to Spain. The Spanish trading port of [[Manila]] facilitated this trade in 1572. Although Spain claimed islands in the Pacific, it did not encounter or claim the Hawaiian Islands.

The Catholicism remains the dominant religion in Spanish America. The crown also imposed restrictions on emigration to the Americas, excluding Jews and [[crypto-Jews]], Protestants, and foreigners, using the ''Casa de Contrataci\u00f3n'' to vet potential emigres and issue licenses to travel.\n\nThe portrait to the right was most likely used as a souvenir. For those who traveled to the New World and back it was common to bring back souvenirs as there were a great interest in what the New World meant.

Once those issues were resolved theologically, in practice the crown sought to protect its new vassals. It did so by dividing peoples of the Americas into the ''Rep\u00fablica de Indios'', the native populations, and the ''Rep\u00fablica de Espa\u00f1oles''. The Rep\u00fablica de Espa\u00f1oles was the entire Hispanic sector, composed of Spaniards, but also Africans (enslaved and free), as well as mixed-race [[casta]]s.\n\nWithin the ''Rep\u00fablica de Indios'', men were explicitly excluded from ordination to the Catholic priesthood and obligation for military service as well as the jurisdiction of the Inquisition. Indians under colonial rule who lived in pueblos de indios had crown protections due to their statuses as legal minors. Due to the lack of prior exposure to the Catholic faith, Queen Isabella had declared all indigenous peoples her subjects. This differed from people of the African continent because these populations had theoretically been exposed to Catholicism and chose not to follow it. This religious differentiation is important because it gave indigenous communities legal protections from members of the R\u00e9publica de Espa\u00f1oles. In fact, an often overlooked aspect of the colonial legal system was that members of the pueblos de indios could appeal to the crown and circumvent the legal system in the R\u00e9publica de Espa\u00f1oles. The statuses of the indigenous populations as legal minors barred them from becoming priests, but the r\u00e9publica de indios operated with a fair amount of autonomy. Missionaries also acted as guardians against ''encomendero'' exploitation. Indian communities had protections of traditional lands by the creation of community lands that could not be alienated, the ''fondo legal''. They managed their own affairs internally through Indian town government under the supervision of royal officials, the ''corregidores'' and ''alcaldes mayores''. Although indigenous men were barred from becoming priests, indigenous communities created religious [[confraternity|confraternaties]] under priestly supervision, which functioned as burial societies for their individual members, but also organized community celebrations for their patron saint. Blacks also had separate confraternities, which likewise contributed to community formation and cohesion, reinforcing identity within a Christian institution.<ref>{{cite book |last=von Germeten |first=Nicole |title=Black Blood Brothers: Confraternities and Social Mobility for Afro-Mexicans |location=Gainesville, FL |publisher=University of Florida Press |date=2006}}</ref>\n\nConquest and evangelization were inseparable in Spanish America. The first order to make the trip to the Americas were the Franciscans, led by Pedro de Gante. Franciscans believed that living a spiritual life of poverty and holiness was the best way to be an example that inspired others to convert. The friars would walk into the towns barefoot as a display of their surrender to God in a sort of theater of conversion.  With this began the practice of evangelization of the peoples of the new world as supported by the Spanish government. \nReligious orders in Spanish America had their own internal structures and were organizationally autonomous, but nonetheless were very important to the structure of colonial society. They had their own resources and hierarchies. Though some orders took vows of poverty, by the time the second wave of friars came to the Americas and as their numbers grew, the orders began amassing wealth and thus became key economic players. The church, as this wealthy power, had huge estates and built large constructions such as gilded monasteries and cathedrals. Priests themselves also became wealthy landowners. Orders like the Franciscans also established schools for the indigenous elites as well as hired indigenous laborers, thereby shifting the dynamics in the indigenous communities and their relationship to the Spanish.\n\n[[File:Emperadores del Peru Parte2 - AHG.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Detail of a gallery of portraits of sovereigns in Peru, showing continuity from Inca emperors to Spanish monarchs.

The crown recognized noble status of elite Indians, giving them exemption from the head-tax and the right to use the nobles title ''don'' and ''do\u00f1a''. Indigenous noblemen were a key group for the administration of the Spanish Empire, since they served as intermediaries between crown officials and indigenous communities.{{sfn|Gibson|1964}}<ref>{{cite journal |last=Rowe |first=John H. |title=The Incas Under Spanish Colonial Institutions |journal=[[Hispanic American Historical Review]] |volume=37 |number=2 |date=May 1957 |pages=155\u2013159|doi=10.2307/2510330 |jstor=2510330 |url=http://www.escholarship.org/uc/item/7mm4g75z }}\n\n*{{cite book |last=Fern\u00e1ndez de Recas |first=Guillermo S. |title=Cacicazgos y nobiliario ind\u00edgena de la Nueva Espa\u00f1a |location=M\u00e9xico |publisher=Instituto Bibliogr\u00e1fico Mexicano |date=1961}}</ref> Indigenous noblemen could serve on ''cabildos'', ride horses, and carry firearms. The crown's recognition of indigenous elites as nobles meant that these men were incorporated into colonial system with privileges separating them from Indian commoners. Indian noblemen were thus crucial to the governance of the huge indigenous population. Through their continued loyalty to the crown, they maintained their positions of power within their communities but also served as agents of colonial governance. The Spanish Empire's utilization of local elites to rule large populations that are ethnically distinct from the rulers has long been practiced by earlier empires.{{sfn|Burbank|Cooper|2010|p= 8}} Indian [[cacique]]s were crucial in the early Spanish period, especially when the economy was still based on extracting tribute and labor from commoner Indians who had rendered goods and service to their overlords in the prehispanic period. Caciques mobilized their populations for encomenderos and, later, ''repartimiento'' recipients chosen by the crown. The noblemen became the officers of the cabildo in indigenous communities, regulating internal affairs, as well as defending the communities\u2019 rights in court. In Mexico, this was facilitated by the 1599 establishment of the [[General Indian Court (Mexico)|General Indian Court]] (''Juzgado General de Indios''), which heard legal disputes in which indigenous communities and individuals were engaged. With legal mechanisms for dispute-resolution, there were relatively few outbreaks of violence and rebellion against crown rule. Eighteenth-century rebellions in long-peaceful areas of Mexico, the [[Tzeltal Rebellion of 1712]] and most spectacularly in Peru with the [[Rebellion of T\u00fapac Amaru II|Tupac Amaru Rebellion]] (1780\u201381) saw indigenous noblemen leading uprisings against the Spanish state.\n\nIn the ''Rep\u00fablica de Espa\u00f1oles'', class and race hierarchies were codified in institutional structures. Spaniards emigrating to The Indies were to be Old Christians of [[limpieza de sangre|pure Christian heritage]], with the crown excluding [[New Christians]], converts from Judaism and their descendants, because of their suspect religious status. The crown established the Inquisition in Mexico and Peru in 1571, and later Cartagena de Indias (Colombia), to guard Catholics from the influence of [[crypto-Jews]], Protestants, and foreigners. Church practices established and maintained racial hierarchies by recording baptism, marriage, and burial were kept separate registers for different racial groups. Churches were also physically divided by race.<ref>{{cite book |last=O\u2019Hara |first=Matthew |title=A Flock Divided: Race, Religion, and Politics in Mexico, 1749-1857 |location=Durham |publisher=Duke University Press |date=2009}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Madrid School - Auto-da-fe - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|''Auto de Fe'' in Toledo, Spain 1651.

There was a pyramid of racial status with the apex being the small number of European white (''espa\u00f1oles''), a slightly larger number of mixed-race castas, who, like the whites were mainly urban dwelling, and the largest populations were Indians living in communities in the countryside. Although Indians were classified as part of the ''Rep\u00fabica de Indios'', their offspring of unions with ''Espa\u00f1oles'' and Africans were ''castas''. White-Indian mixtures were more socially acceptable in the Hispanic sphere, with the possibility over generations of mixed-race offspring being classified as Espa\u00f1ol. Any offspring with African ancestry could never remove the \"stain\" of their racial heritage, since Africans were seen as \"natural slaves.\" Eighteenth-century paintings depicted elites' ideas of the [[casta|''sistema de castas'']] in hierarchical order,<ref>{{cite book |last=Katzew |first=Ilona |title=Casta Painting |location=New Haven |publisher=Yale University Press |date=2004}}</ref> but there was some fluidity in the system rather than absolute rigidity.<ref>{{cite book |last=Cope |first=R.

Non-whites (blacks and mixed-race castas) were far more often and more severely punished, while Indians, considered legal minors, were not expected to behave better and were more leniently punished. Royal and municipal legislation attempted to control the behavior of black slaves, who were subject to a curfew, could not carry arms, and were prohibited from running away from their masters. As the urban, white, lower-class (plebeian) population increased, they too were increasingly subject to criminal arrest and punishment. Capital punishment was seldom employed, with the exception of sodomy and recalcitrant prisoners of the Inquisition, whose deviation from Christian orthodoxy was considered extreme. However, only the civil sphere could exercise capital punishment and prisoners were \u201crelaxed,\u201d that is, released to civil authorities. Often criminals served sentences of hard labor in textile workshops (''obrajes''), presidio service on the frontier, and as sailors on royal ships. Royal pardons to ordinary criminals were often accorded on the celebration of a royal marriage, coronation, or birth.<ref>Burkholder, Mark A. \"Criminal Justice\" in {{harvnb|Encyclopedia of Latin American History and Culture|1996|loc=vol. 2, p. 298-300}}\n\n*{{cite book |last=MacLachlan |first=Colin M. |title=Criminal Justice in Eighteenth-Century Mexico: A Study of the Acordada |location=Berkeley |publisher=University of California Press |year=1975}}</ref>\n\nElite Spanish men had access to special corporate protections (''[[fuero]]s'') and had exemptions by virtue of their membership in a particular group. One important privilege was their being judged by the court of their corporation. Members of the clergy held the ''fuero eclesi\u00e1stico'' were judged by ecclesiastical courts, whether the offense was civil or criminal. In the eighteenth century the crown established a standing military and with it, special privileges (''fuero militar''). The privilege extended to the military was the first ''fuero'' extended to the non-whites who served the crown. Indians had a form of corporate privilege through their membership in indigenous communities. In central Mexico, the crown established a special Indian court (Juzgado General de Indios), and legal fees, including access to lawyers, were funded by a special tax.<ref>{{cite book |last=Borah |first=Woodrow |title=Justice by Insurance |location=Berkeley |publisher=University of California Press |year=1983}}</ref> The crown extended the peninsular institution of the merchant guild (''[[consulado]]'') first established in Spain, including Seville (1543), and later established in Mexico City and Peru. Consulado membership was dominated by peninsular-born Spaniards, usually members of transatlantic commercial houses. The consulados\u2019 tribunals heard disputes over contracts, bankruptcy, shipping, insurance and the like and became a wealthy and powerful economic institution and source of loans to the viceroyalties.<ref>Woodward, Ralph Lee. \u201cConsulado\u201d in {{harvnb|Encyclopedia of Latin American History and Culture|1996|loc=vol. 2, p. 254-256}}</ref> Transatlantic trade remained in the hands of mercantile families based in Spain and the Indies. The men in the Indies were often younger relatives of the merchants in Spain, who often married wealthy American-born women. American-born Spanish men (''criollos'') in general did not pursue commerce but instead owned landed estates, entered the priesthood, or became a professional. Within elite families then peninsular-born Spaniards and ''criollos'' were often kin.{{sfn|Lockhart|Schwartz|1983|p= 324-325}}\n\nThe regulation of the social system perpetuated the privileged status of wealthy elite white men against the vast indigenous populations, and the smaller but still significant number of mixed-race castas. In the Bourbon era, for the first time there was a distinction made between Iberian-born and American-born Spaniards, In the Habsburg era, in law and ordinary speech they were grouped together without distinction. Increasingly American-born Spaniards developed a distinctly local focus, with peninsular-born (''peninsulares'') Spaniards increasingly seen as outsiders and resented, but this was a development in the late colonial period. Resentment against ''peninsulares'' was due to a deliberate change in crown policy, which systematically favored them over American-born ''criollos'' for high positions in the civil and religious hierarchies.{{sfn|Lockhart|Schwartz|1983|p=320}} This left ''criollos'' only the membership in a city or town's cabildo. When the secularizing Bourbon monarchy pursued policies strengthening secular royal power over religious power, it attacked the ''fuero eclesi\u00e1stico'', which for many members of the lower clergy was a significant privilege. Parish priests who had functioned as royal officials as well as clerics in Indian towns lost their privileged position. At the same time the crown established a standing army and promoted militias for the defense of empire, creating a new avenue of privilege for creole men and for castas, but excluding indigenous men from conscription or voluntary service.\n\n==Economic policy==\n{{See also|Latin American economy#Colonial era and Independence (ca._1500\u20131850)}}\n[[File:Moll - Map of South America - Detail Potosi.png|thumb|[[Cerro de Potos\u00ed]], discovered in 1545, the rich, sole source of silver from Peru, worked by compulsory indigenous labor called [[mit'a]]]]\n\nThe Spanish Empire benefited from favorable [[factor endowments]] in its overseas possessions with their large, exploitable, indigenous populations and rich mining areas.<ref name=\"Sokoloff\">{{cite journal|authors=Kenneth L.

While the Habsburgs were committed to maintaining a state monopoly in theory, in reality the Empire was a porous economic realm and smuggling was widespread. In the 16th and 17th century under the Habsburgs, Spain experienced a gradual decline in economic conditions, especially relative to the industrial development of its French, Dutch, and English rivals. Many of the goods being exported to the Empire originated from manufacturers in northwest Europe, rather than in Spain. But illicit commercial activities became a part of the Empire's administrative structure. Supported by large flows of silver from America, trade prohibited by Spanish mercantilist trade restrictions flourished, because it provided a source of income to both crown officials and private merchants.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Silver, trade, and war : spain and america in the making of early modern europe.|last=Stein, Stanley J.|date=2003|publisher=Johns Hopkins Univ Press|isbn=0-8018-7755-5|oclc=173164546}}</ref> The local administrative structure in Buenos Aires, for example, was established through its oversight of both legal and illegal commerce.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Moutoukias|first=Zacarias|date=1988|title=Power, Corruption, and Commerce: The Making of the Local Administrative Structure in Seventeenth-Century Buenos Aires|journal=The Hispanic American Historical Review|volume=68|issue=4|pages=771\u2013801|doi=10.2307/2515681|issn=0018-2168|jstor=2515681}}</ref> In the eighteenth century the crown attempted to reverse course under the Bourbon monarchs. The crown's pursuit of wars to maintain and expand territory, defend the Catholic faith and stamp out Protestantism, and beat back Ottoman Turkish strength outstripped its ability to pay for it all, despite the huge production of silver in Peru and Mexico. Most of that flow paid mercenary soldiers in the European religious wars in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries and into foreign merchants\u2019 hands to pay for the consumer goods manufactured in northern Europe. Paradoxically the wealth of the Indies impoverished Spain and enriched northern Europe. In the eighteenth century the crown attempted to reverse course under the Bourbon monarchs.{{sfn|Stein|Stein|2000|p= 40-57}}\n\nThis was well recognized in Spain, with writers on political economy, the ''[[arbitristas]]'' sending the crown lengthy analyses in the form of \"memorials, of the perceived problems and with proposed solutions.<ref>Andrien, Kenneth A. \u201cArbitristas\u201d in {{harvnb|Encyclopedia of Latin American History and Culture|1996|loc=vol. 1 p. 122}}</ref>{{sfn|Stein|Stein|2000|p=94-102}} According to these thinkers, \"Royal expenditure must be regulated, the sale of office halted, the growth of the church checked. The tax system must be overhauled, special concessions be made to agricultural laborers, rivers be made navigable and dry lands irrigated. In this way alone could Castile's productivity increased, its commerce restored, and its humiliating dependence on foreigners, on the Dutch and the Genoese, be brought to an end.\"{{sfn|Elliott|1989|p=231}}\n\nFrom the early days of the Caribbean and conquest era, the crown attempted to control trade between Spain and the Indies with restrictive policies enforced by the House of Trade (est. 1503) in Seville. Shipping was through particular ports in Spain (Seville, subsequently Cadiz), Spanish America (Veracruz, Acapulco, Havana, Cartagena de Indias, and Callao/Lima) and the Philippines (Manila). Spanish settlers in the Indies in the very early period were few and Spain could supply sufficient goods to them. But as the Aztec and Inca empires were conquered in the early sixteenth century and then large deposits of silver found in both Mexico and Peru, the regions of those major empires, Spanish immigration increased and demand for goods rose far beyond Spain's ability to supply it. Since Spain had little capital to invest in the expanding trade and no significant commercial group, bankers and commercial houses in Genoa, Germany, The Netherlands, France, and England supplied both investment capital and goods in a supposedly closed system. Even in the sixteenth century, Spain recognized that the idealized closed system did not function in reality. Despite that the crown did not alter its restrictive structure or advocacy of fiscal prudence, despite the pleas of the ''arbitristas'', the Indies trade remained nominally in the hands of Spain, but in fact enriched the other European countries.\n[[File:Spanish Galleon.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Spanish galleon]], the mainstay of transatlantic and transpacific shipping, engraving by [[Albert Durer]]]] \nThe crown established the system of [[Spanish treasure fleets|treasure fleets]] ({{lang-es|flota}}) to protect the conveyance of silver to Seville (later Cadiz). Merchants in Seville conveyed consumer goods that were registered and taxed by the House of Trade. were sent to the Indies were produced in other European countries. Other European commercial interests came to dominate supply, with Spanish merchant houses and their guilds (''[[consulado]]s'') in Spain and the Indies acting as mere middlemen, reaping profits a slice of the profits. However, those profits did not promote Spanish economic development of a manufacturing sector, with its economy continuing to be based on agriculture. The wealth of the Indies led to prosperity in northern Europe, particularly The Netherlands and England, both Protestant. As Spain's power weakened in the seventeenth century, England, The Netherlands, and the French took advantage overseas by seizing islands in the Caribbean, which became bases for a burgeoning contraband trade in Spanish America. Crown officials who were supposed to suppress contraband trade were quite often in cahoots with the foreigners, since it was a source of personal enrichment. In Spain, the crown itself participated in collusion with foreign merchant houses, since they paid fines, \"meant to establish a compensation to the state for losses through fraud.\" it became for merchant houses a calculated risk for doing business; for the crown it gained income it would have lost otherwise. Foreigner merchants were part of the supposed monopoly system of trade. The transfer of the House of Trade from Seville to Cadiz meant even easier access of foreign merchant houses to the Spanish trade.{{sfn|Lynch|1989|pages=10\u201311}}\n\nThe motor of the Spanish imperial economy that had a global impact was [[silver mining]]. The mines in Peru and Mexico were in the hands of a few elite mining entrepreneurs, with access to capital and a stomach for the risk mining entailed. They operated under a system of royal licensing, since the crown held the rights to subsoil wealth. Mining entrepreneurs assumed all the risk of the enterprise, while the crown gained a 20% slice of the profits, the [[royal fifth]] (\u201cQuinto\u201d). Further adding to the crown's revenues was mining was that it crown held a monopoly on the supply of mercury, used for separating pure silver from silver ore in the [[patio process]]. The crown kept the price high, thereby depressing the volume of silver production.<ref name=\"Miningcolonies\">Bakewell, Peter and Kendall W.

Its success can be judged by the fact that the silver fleet was captured only once, in 1628 by Dutch privateer [[Piet Pieterszoon Hein|Piet Hein]]. That loss resulted in the bankruptcy of the Spanish crown and an extended period of economic depression in Spain.<ref>Fisher, John R. \u201cFleet System (Flota)\u201d in {{harvnb|Encyclopedia of Latin American History and Culture|1996|loc= vol. 2, p. 575}}</ref>\nOne practice used by the Spanish to gather workers for the mines was called ''repartimiento''. This was a rotational forced labor system where indigenous pueblos were obligated to send laborers to work in Spanish mines and plantations for a set number of days out of the year. Repartimiento was not implemented to replace slave labor but instead existed alongside free wage labor, slavery, and indentured labor. It was, however, a way for the Spanish to procure cheap labor thus boosting the mining-driven economy. It is important to note that the men who worked as repartimiento laborers were not always resistant to the practice. Some were drawn to the labor as a way to supplement the wages they earned cultivating fields so as to support their families and, of course, pay tributes. At first, a Spaniard could get repartimiento laborers to work for them with permission from a crown official, such as a viceroy,  only on the basis that this labor was absolutely necessary to provide the country with important resources. This condition became laxer as the years went on and various enterprises had repartimiento laborers where they would work in dangerous conditions for long hours and low wages. <ref>{{cite book |last1=Tutino |first1=John |title=In The Mexican Heartland: How Communities Shaped Capitalism, a Nation, and World History, 1500-2000 |date=2018 |publisher=Princeton University Press |pages=57\u201390}}</ref>\n\n[[File:1713 Asiento contract.png|thumb|upright|Cover of the English translation of the Asiento contract signed by Britain and Spain in 1713 as part of the Utrecht treaty that ended the War of Spanish Succession.

It attempted to restructure to establish as closed trading system, but it was hampered by the terms of the 1713 Treaty of Utrecht. The treaty ending the War of the Spanish Succession with a victory for the Bourbon French candidate for the throne had a provision for the British to legally trade by a license (''[[asiento]]'') African slaves to Spanish America. The provision undermined the possibility of a revamped Spanish monopoly system. The merchants also used the opportunity to engage in contraband trade of their manufactured goods. Crown policy sought to make legal trade more appealing than contraband by instituting free commerce (''comercio libre'') in 1778 whereby Spanish American ports could trade with each other and they could trade with any port in Spain. It was aimed at revamping a closed Spanish system and outflanking the increasingly powerful British empire. Silver production revived in the eighteenth century, with production far surpassing the earlier output. The crown reducing the taxes on mercury, meaning that a greater volume of pure silver could be refined. Silver mining absorbed most available capital in Mexico and Peru, and the crown emphasized the production of precious metals that was sent to Spain. There was some economic development in the Indies to supply food, but a diversified economy did not emerge.<ref name= Miningcolonies/> The economic reforms of the Bourbon era both shaped and were themselves impacted by geopolitical developments in Europe. The Bourbon Reforms arose out of the [[War of the Spanish Succession]]. In turn, the crown's attempt to tighten its control over its colonial markets in the Americas led to further conflict with other European powers who were vying for access to them. After a sparking a series of skirmishes throughout the 1700s over its stricter policies, Spain's reformed trade system led to war with Britain in 1796.<ref>{{Cite book|chapter=War and Reform, 1736\u20131749|last=Kuethe|first=Allan J.|last2=Andrien|first2=Kenneth J.|date=May 2014|website=The Spanish Atlantic World in the Eighteenth Century: War and the Bourbon Reforms, 1713\u20131796|language=en|doi=10.1017/cbo9781107338661.007|title=The Spanish Atlantic World in the Eighteenth Century|pages=133\u2013166|isbn=9781107338661}}</ref> In the Americas, meanwhile, economic policies enacted under the Bourbons had different impacts in different regions.

During his rule, Spain defeated an Austrian and British invasion of Spain but lost control of Italy during the [[War of the Spanish Succession]] (1701\u20131714), [[Spanish conquest of Oran (1732)|conquered Oran]] from the [[Ottoman Empire]] (1732), [[Battle of Bitonto|recaptured Naples and Sicily]] during the [[War of the Polish Succession]] (1733\u20131735), and fought in the [[War of the Austrian Succession]] (1740\u20131748), briefly conquering [[Milan]], [[Parma]], and [[Piacenza]].]]\n\nWith the 1700 death of the childless [[Charles II of Spain]], the crown of Spain was contested in the [[War of the Spanish Succession]].\nUnder the [[Treaties of Utrecht]] (11 April 1713) ending the war, the French prince of the [[House of Bourbon]], Philippe of Anjou, grandchild of [[Louis XIV of France]], became the king [[Philip V of Spain|Philip V]]. He retained the Spanish overseas empire in the Americas and the Philippines. The settlement gave spoils to those who had backed a Habsburg for the Spanish monarchy, ceding European territory of the [[Spanish Netherlands]], [[Kingdom of Naples|Naples]], [[Duchy of Milan|Milan]], and [[Sardinia]] to Austria; [[Sicily]] and parts of Milan to the [[Duchy of Savoy]], and [[Gibraltar]] and [[Menorca]] to the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]]. The treaty also granted the British the exclusive right to [[slave trade|slave trading]] in [[Spanish America]] for thirty years, the ''[[asiento]]'', as well as licensed voyages to ports in Spanish colonial dominions, openings, for both licit and illicit trade.{{sfn|Braudel|1984|loc=vol. 2, p. 418}}\n\nSpain's economic and demographic recovery had begun slowly in the last decades of the Habsburg reign, as was evident from the growth of its trading convoys and the much more rapid growth of illicit trade during the period. (This growth was slower than the growth of illicit trade by northern rivals in the empire's markets.) However, this recovery was not then translated into institutional improvement, rather the \"proximate solutions to permanent problems.\"{{sfn|Lynch|1989|p= 1}} This legacy of neglect was reflected in the early years of Bourbon rule in which the military was ill-advisedly pitched into battle in the [[War of the Quadruple Alliance]] (1718\u20131720). Following the war, the new Bourbon monarchy took a much more cautious approach to international relations, relying on a family alliance with Bourbon France, and continuing to follow a program of institutional renewal.\n\nThe crown program to enact reforms that promoted administrative control and efficiency in the metropole to the detriment of interests in the colonies undermined creole elites' loyalty to the crown. When French forces of [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] invaded the Iberian peninsula in 1808, Napoleon ousted the Spanish Bourbon monarchy, placing his brother [[Joseph Bonaparte]] on the Spanish throne. There was a crisis of legitimacy of crown rule in Spanish America, leading to the [[Spanish American wars of independence]] (1808-1826).\n\n=== Bourbon reforms ===\n{{Main|Bourbon Reforms}}\n[[File:Francisco Antonio Vallejo - Glorification of the Immaculate Conception - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|Representation of the two powers, church and state, symbolized by the altar and the throne, with the presence of the king [[Charles III of Spain|Charles III]] and the Pope [[Clement XIV]], seconded by the [[Viceroy of New Spain|Viceroy]], [[Antonio Mar\u00eda de Bucareli y Urs\u00faa|Antonio Bucareli]], and the [[Archbishop of Mexico]], [[Alonso N\u00fa\u00f1ez de Haro y Peralta|Alonso N\u00fa\u00f1ez de Haro]], respectively, before the Virgin Mary. \"Glorification of the Immaculate Conception\".]]\n\nThe Spanish Bourbons' broadest intentions were to reorganize the institutions of empire to better administer it for the benefit of Spain and the crown.

Centralization of power was to be for the benefit of the crown and the metropole and for the defense of its empire against foreign incursions.<ref name=\"Bourbon Reforms\" /> From the viewpoint of Spain, the structures of colonial rule under the Habsburgs were no longer functioning to the benefit of Spain, with much wealth being retained in Spanish America and going to other European powers.

Individual sailings at regular intervals were slow to displace the traditional armed convoys, but by the 1760s there were regular ships plying the Atlantic from Cadiz to [[Havana]] and [[Puerto Rico]], and at longer intervals to the [[R\u00edo de la Plata]], where an additional [[viceroy]]alty was created in 1776. The contraband trade that was the lifeblood of the Habsburg empire declined in proportion to registered shipping (a shipping registry having been established in 1735).\n\nTwo upheavals registered unease within Spanish America and at the same time demonstrated the renewed resiliency of the reformed system: the [[T\u00fapac Amaru II|Tupac Amaru uprising]] in Peru in 1780 and the [[Revolt of the Comuneros (New Granada)|rebellion of the ''comuneros'']] of [[Viceroyalty of New Granada|New Granada]], both in part reactions to tighter, more efficient control.\n\n=== 18th-century prosperity ===\n[[File:FORTRESS OF SAN FELIPE CARTAGENA.JPG|thumb|San Felipe de Barajas Fortress [[Cartagena de Indias]].

Spain's crucial victory in the [[Battle of Cartagena de Indias]] against a massive British fleet and army in the Caribbean port of [[Cartagena de Indias]], one of a number of successful battles against the British, helped Spain secure its dominance of America until the 19th century. But different regions fared differently under Bourbon rule, and even while New Spain was particularly prosperous, it was also marked by steep wealth inequality. Silver production boomed in New Spain during the 18th century, with output more than tripling between the start of the century and the 1750s. The economy and the population both grew, both centered around Mexico City. But while mine owners and the crown benefited from the flourishing silver economy, most of the population in the rural Baj\u00edo faced rising land prices, falling wages. Eviction of many from their lands resulted.<ref>{{Cite book|title=New countries capitalism, revolutions, and nations in the Americas, 1750-1870|last=Tutino, John, 1947-|date=2016|publisher=Duke University Press|isbn=978-0-8223-6114-5|oclc=1107326871}}</ref>\n\nThat British Armada was the biggest ever gathered before the [[D-Day|Normandy landings]] which even exceeded in more than 60 ships Philip's II Great Armada.

Shipping grew rapidly from the mid-1740s until the [[Seven Years' War]] (1756\u20131763), reflecting in part the success of the Bourbons in bringing illicit trade under control. With the loosening of trade controls after the Seven Years' War, shipping trade within the empire once again began to expand, reaching an extraordinary rate of growth in the 1780s.\n\nThe end of Cadiz's monopoly of trade with America brought about a rebirth of Spanish manufactures. Most notable was the rapidly growing textile industry of [[Catalonia]] which by the mid-1780s saw the first signs of industrialization. This saw the emergence of a small, politically active commercial class in [[Barcelona]]. This isolated pocket of advanced economic development stood in stark contrast to the relative backwardness of most of the country. Most of the improvements were in and around some major coastal cities and the major islands such as [[Cuba]], with its tobacco [[plantation]]s, and a renewed growth of [[precious metal]]s mining in America.\n\nOn the other hand, most of rural Spain and its empire, where the great bulk of the population lived, lived in relatively backward conditions by 18th-century West European standards, reinforced old customs and isolation. Agricultural productivity remained low despite efforts to introduce new techniques to what was for the most part an uninterested, exploited peasant and labouring groups. Governments were inconsistent in their policies. Though there were substantial improvements by the late 18th century, Spain was still an economic backwater. Under the [[mercantilism|mercantile]] trading arrangements it had difficulty in providing the goods being demanded by the strongly growing markets of its empire, and providing adequate outlets for the return trade.\n\nFrom an opposing point of view according to the \"backwardness\" mentioned above the naturalist and explorer [[Alexander von Humboldt]] traveled extensively throughout the Spanish Americas, exploring and describing it for the first time from a modern scientific point of view between 1799 and 1804. In his work ''Political essay on the kingdom of New Spain containing researches relative to the geography of Mexico'' he says that the Indians of [[Viceroyalty of New Spain|New Spain]] lived in better conditions than any Russian or German peasant in Europe.{{sfn|von Humboldt|1811}} According to Humboldt, despite the fact that Indian farmers were poor, under Spanish rule they were free and slavery was non-existent, their conditions were much better than any other peasant or farmer in the advanced Northern Europe.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Janota |first1=Tom |title=Alexander von Humboldt, un explorador cient\u00edfico en Am\u00e9rica |publisher=CIDCLI |isbn=9786078351121 |pages=64 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=jmuVBgAAQBAJ |language=en |date=2015-02-09}}</ref>\n\nHumboldt also published a comparative analysis of bread and meat consumption in New Spain (M\u00e9xico) compared to other cities in Europe such as Paris. Mexico City consumed 189 pounds of meat per person per year, in comparison to 163 pounds consumed by the inhabitants of Paris, the Mexicans also consumed almost the same amount of bread as any European city, with 363 kilograms of bread per person per year in comparison to the 377 kilograms consumed in Paris. Caracas consumed seven times more meat per person than in Paris. Von Humboldt also said that the average income in that period was four times the European income and also that the cities of New Spain were richer than many European cities.{{sfn|von Humboldt|1811}}\n\n=== Contesting with other empires ===\n[[File:Spanish troops at Pensacola.jpg|thumb|upright|A Spanish army captures British [[Pensacola, Florida|Pensacola]] in 1781.

The relatively more peaceful century under the new monarchy had allowed it to rebuild and start the long process of modernizing its institutions and economy, and the demographic decline of the 17th century had been reversed. It was a middle-ranking power with great power pretensions that could not be ignored. But time was to be against it.\n\n====Military recovery in Europe====\nBourbon institutional reforms bore fruit militarily when Spanish forces easily [[Battle of Bitonto|retook]] [[Kingdom of Naples|Naples]] and [[Kingdom of Sicily|Sicily]] from the Austrians in 1734 during the [[War of the Polish Succession]], and during the [[War of Jenkins' Ear]] (1739\u201342) thwarted British efforts to seize the strategic cities of [[Battle of Cartagena de Indias|Cartagena de Indias]] and [[Invasion of Cuba (1741)|Santiago de Cuba]] by defeating a massive British army and navy{{efn|text=This was the largest amphibious attack until the [[Invasion of Normandy]] in 1944.{{sfn|Victoria|2005}}}} led by [[Edward Vernon]], which ended Britain's ambitions in the [[Spanish Main]].\n\nIn 1742, the War of Jenkins' Ear merged with the larger [[War of the Austrian Succession]], and [[King George's War]] in North America. The British, also occupied with France, were unable to capture Spanish convoys, and the Spanish privateers attacked British merchant shipping along the [[Triangle Trade]] routes. In Europe, Spain had been trying to divest [[Maria Theresa]] of Lombardy in northern Italy since 1741, but faced the opposition of [[Charles Emmanuel III of Sardinia]], and warfare in northern Italy remained indecisive throughout the period up to 1746.\n\nBy the 1748 [[Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1748)|Treaty of Aix-la-Chappelle]], Spain gained Parma, Piacenza, and Guastalla in northern Italy.

Jamaica was the last British stronghold of importance in the Caribbean. G\u00e1lvez organized a landing on the island; however, the [[Peace of Paris (1783)]] was concluded and the invasion cancelled.\n\n====Contestation in Brazil====\nThe majority of the territory of today's Brazil had been claimed as Spanish when exploration began with the navigation of the length of the [[Amazon River]] in 1541\u201342 by [[Francisco de Orellana]]. Many Spanish expeditions explored large parts of this vast region, especially those close to Spanish settlements. During the 16th and 17th centuries, Spanish soldiers, missionaries and adventurers also established pioneering communities, primarily in [[Paran\u00e1 (state)|Paran\u00e1]], Santa Catarina, and [[S\u00e3o Paulo]], and forts on the northeastern coast threatened by the French and Dutch.\n[[File:Imperios Espa\u00f1ol y Portugu\u00e9s 1790.svg|thumb|Spanish and Portuguese empires in 1790.]]\n\nAs Portuguese-Brazilian settlement expanded, following in the trail of the [[Bandeirantes]] exploits, these isolated Spanish groups were eventually integrated into Brazilian society. Only some Castilians who were displaced from the disputed areas of the Pampas of [[Rio Grande do Sul]] have left a significant influence on the formation of the [[gaucho]], when they mixed with Indian groups, Portuguese and blacks who arrived in the region during the 18th century. The Spanish were barred by their laws from slaving of indigenous people, leaving them without a commercial interest deep in the interior of the Amazon basin. The Laws of Burgos (1512) and the New Laws (1542) had been intended to protect the interests of indigenous people. The Portuguese-Brazilian slavers, the Bandeirantes, had the advantage of access from the mouth of the Amazon River, which was on the Portuguese side of the line of Tordesillas. One famous attack upon a Spanish mission in 1628 resulted in the enslavement of about 60,000 indigenous people.{{efn|text=An early bandeira in 1628, (led by [[Ant\u00f4nio Raposo Tavares]]), composed of 2,000 allied Indians, 900 Mamluks ([[Mestizo]]s) and 69 white [[S\u00e3o Paulo (state)|Paulistanos]], to find precious metals and stones and/or to capture Indians for slavery. This expedition alone was responsible for the destruction of most of the Jesuit missions of Spanish [[Guair\u00e1 Department|Guair\u00e1]] and the enslavement of 60,000 indigenous people. In response the missions that followed were heavily fortified.}}\n\nIn time, there was in effect a self-funding force of occupation. By the 18th century, much of the Spanish territory was under de facto control of Portuguese-Brazil. This reality was recognized with the legal transfer of sovereignty in 1750 of most of the Amazon basin and surrounding areas to Portugal in the [[Treaty of Madrid (13 January 1750)|Treaty of Madrid]]. This settlement sowed the seeds of the [[Guaran\u00ed War]] in 1756.\n\n====Rival empires in the Pacific Northwest====\n{{Main|Spanish expeditions to the Pacific Northwest}}\n[[File:NutcaEN.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Spanish territorial claims on the West Coast of North America in the 18th century, contested by the Russian empire and the British. Most of what Spain claimed in North America was not directly occupied or controlled.]]\n\nSpain claimed all of North America in the Age of Discovery, but claims were not translated into occupation until a major resource was discovered and Spanish settlement and crown rule put in place. The French had established an [[French America|empire]] in northern North America and took some islands in the Caribbean. The English established colonies on the eastern seaboard of North America and in northern North America and some Caribbean islands as well. In the eighteenth century, the Spanish crown realized that its territorial claims needed to be defended, particularly in the wake of its visible weakness during the Seven Years' War when Britain captured the important Spanish ports of Havana and Manila. Another important factor was that the [[Russian America|Russian empire]] had expanded into North America from the mid-eighteenth century, with [[Maritime fur trade|fur trading settlements]] in what is now Alaska and forts as far south as Fort Ross, California. Great Britain was also expanding into areas that Spain claimed as its territory on the Pacific coast. Taking steps to shore up its fragile claims to California, Spain began planning [[Spanish missions in California|California missions]] in 1769. Spain also began a series of voyages to the Pacific Northwest, where Russia and Great Britain were encroaching on claimed territory. The [[Spanish expeditions to the Pacific Northwest]], with [[Alessandro Malaspina]] and others sailing for Spain, came too late for Spain to assert its sovereignty in the Pacific Northwest.{{sfn|Kamen|2003|p=237, 485}} The [[Nootka Crisis]] (1789\u20131791) nearly brought Spain and Britain to war. It was a dispute over claims in the Pacific Northwest, where neither nation had established permanent settlements. The crisis could have led to war, but it was resolved in the [[Nootka Convention]], in which Spain and Great Britain agreed to not establish settlements and allowed free access to Nootka Sound on the west coast of what is now [[Vancouver Island]]. In 1806 Baron [[Nikolai Rezanov]] attempted to negotiate a treaty between the [[Russian-American Company]] and the [[Viceroyalty of New Spain]], but his unexpected death in 1807 ended any treaty hopes. Spain gave up its claims in the West of North America in the [[Adams-Onis Treaty]] of 1819, ceding its rights there to the United States, allowing the U.S. to purchase Florida, and establishing a boundary New Spain and the U.S. When the negotiations between the two nations were taking place, Spain's resources were stretched due to the [[Spanish American wars of independence]].<ref>Salvucci, Linda K. \"Adams-Onis Treaty (1819)\" in {{harvnb|Encyclopedia of Latin American History and Culture|1996|loc=vol. 1, pp. 11-12}}</ref>\n\n====Loss of Spanish Louisiana====\n{{Main|Louisiana (New Spain)}}\n[[File:SpanishEmpire1790.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|Spanish Empire in 1790.

The crown constructed missions and presidios in coastal California and [[Spanish expeditions to the Pacific Northwest|sent maritime expeditions]] to the Pacific Northwest to assert sovereignty.]]\n\nThe growth of trade and wealth in the colonies caused increasing political tensions as frustration grew with the improving but still restrictive trade with Spain. Malaspina's recommendation to turn the empire into a looser [[confederation]] to help improve governance and trade so as to quell the growing political tensions between the \u00e9lites of the empire's periphery and center was suppressed by a monarchy afraid of losing control. All was to be swept away by the tumult that was to overtake Europe at the turn of the 19th century with the [[French Revolutionary Wars|French Revolutionary]] and [[Napoleonic Wars]].\n\nThe first major territory Spain was to lose in the 19th century was the vast and wild [[Louisiana (New Spain)|Louisiana Territory]], which stretched north to Canada and was ceded by France in 1763 under the terms of the [[Treaty of Fontainebleau (1762)|Treaty of Fontainebleau]]. The French, under Napoleon, took back possession as part of the [[Third Treaty of San Ildefonso|Treaty of San Ildefonso]] in 1800 and sold it to the United States in the [[Louisiana Purchase]] of 1803. Napoleon's sale of the Louisiana Territory to the United States in 1803 caused border disputes between the United States and Spain that, with rebellions in [[West Florida]] (1810) and in the remainder of Louisiana at the mouth of the [[Mississippi river|Mississippi]], led to their eventual cession to the United States,\n\n====Other challenges to the Spanish Empire====\n[[File:Churruca death.jpg|thumb|''[[Cosme Dami\u00e1n de Churruca y Elorza|Churruca]]'s Death'', oil on canvas about the [[Battle of Trafalgar]] by [[Eugenio \u00c1lvarez Dumont]], [[Prado]] Museum.]]\n\nThe destruction of the main Spanish fleet, under French command, at the [[Battle of Trafalgar]] (1805) undermined Spain's ability to defend and hold on to its empire. The [[British invasions of the R\u00edo de la Plata]] attempted to seize the [[Viceroyalty of the R\u00edo de la Plata]] in 1806. The [[viceroy]] retreated hastily to the hills when defeated by a small British force. However, the ''[[Criollo people|Criollos]]''' militias and colonial army eventually repulsed the British. The later intrusion of Napoleonic forces into Spain in 1808 (see [[Peninsular War]]) cut off the effective connection with the empire. A combination of internal and external factors led to the unforeseen loss of most of Spain's empire in the Indies in the [[Spanish American wars of independence]].\n\n== End of the global empire (1808\u20131899) ==\n[[File:Mapa de la Am\u00e9rica espa\u00f1ola (1800).png|thumb|upright=1.35|The [[Americas]] towards the year 1800, the colored territories were considered provinces in some maps of the Spanish Empire.]]\n[[File:El dos de mayo de 1808 en Madrid.jpg|thumb|''[[The Second of May 1808]]: The Charge of the Mamelukes'', by [[Francisco de Goya]] (1814) showing Spanish resistance to French troops in Madrid]]\n\nIn 1808, Napoleon forces invaded the Iberian peninsula, resulting in the evacuation of the Portuguese royal family to Brazil and the [[Abdications of Bayonne|abdication]] of the Spanish King.

The French invasion also sparked in many places in Spanish America a crisis of legitimacy of crown rule and movements that resulted in political independence. In Spain, political uncertainty lasted over a decade and turmoil for several decades, civil wars on succession disputes, a republic, and finally a [[liberal democracy]]. Resistance coalesced around [[junta (Peninsular War)|juntas]], emergency ad-hoc governments. A [[Supreme Central and Governing Junta of the Kingdom]], ruling in the name of [[Ferdinand VII]], was created on 25 September 1808 to coordinate efforts among the various juntas.\n\n=== Spanish American conflicts and independence 1810-1833 ===\n{{Main|Spanish American wars of independence|Junta (Peninsular War)}}\n\nThe idea of a separate identity for Spanish America has been developed in the modern historical literature,{{sfn|Brading|1993}} but the idea of complete Spanish American independence from the Spanish Empire was not general at the time and political independence was not inevitable. Historian Brian Hamnett argues that had the Spanish monarchy and Spanish liberals been more flexible regarding the place of the overseas possessions, that the empire would not have collapsed.{{sfn|Hamnett| 2017}} Juntas emerged in Spanish America as Spain faced a political crisis due to the invasion by Napoleon Bonaparte and abdication of Ferdinand VII. Spanish Americans reacted in much the same way the Peninsular Spanish did, legitimizing their actions through traditional law, which held that sovereignty reverted to the people in the absence of a legitimate king.\n\nThe majority of Spanish Americans continued to support the idea of maintaining a [[monarchy]], but did not support retaining [[absolute monarchy]] under Ferdinand VII.<ref>\"Historians generally have assumed that these movements invoked the name of Fernando VII to mask their real goal: achieving independence\". 1998 Jaime E.

The juntas in the Americas did not accept the governments of the Europeans \u2013 neither the government set up for Spain by the French nor the various Spanish Governments set up in response to the French invasion. The juntas did not accept the Spanish regency, isolated under [[Siege of C\u00e1diz|siege in the city of Cadiz]] (1810\u20131812). They also rejected the [[Spanish Constitution of 1812]] although the Constitution gave Spanish citizenship those in the territories that had belonged to the Spanish monarchy in both hemispheres.<ref>{{cite book\n| last = Pe\u00f1a\n| first = Lorenzo\n| title = Un Puente jur\u00eddico entre Iberoam\u00e9rica y Europa: la Constituci\u00f3n espa\u00f1ola de 1812\n| language = Spanish\n| publisher = Casa de Am\u00e9rica-CSIC\n| year = 2002\n| isbn = 978-84-88490-55-1\n| pages = 6\u20137\n| url = http://digital.csic.es/bitstream/10261/9858/1/1812Cadiz.pdf\n}}</ref>\nThe liberal Spanish Constitution of 1812 recognized [[indigenous peoples of the Americas]] as Spanish citizens. But the acquisition of citizenship for any [[casta]] of [[Afro-American peoples of the Americas]] was through [[naturalization]] \u2013 excluding [[slaves]].\n\nA long period of wars followed in America from 1811 to 1829. In South America this period of wars led to the independence of [[Argentina]] (1810), [[Venezuela]] (1810), [[Chile]] (1810), [[Paraguay]] (1811) and [[Uruguay]] (1815, but subsequently ruled by Brazil until 1828). [[Jos\u00e9 de San Mart\u00edn]] campaigned for independence in [[Chile]] (1818) and in [[Peru]] (1821). Further north, [[Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar]] led forces that won independence between 1811 and 1826 for the area that became [[Venezuela]], [[Colombia]], [[Ecuador]], [[Per\u00fa]] and [[Bolivia]] (then [[Alto Per\u00fa]]). [[Panama]] declared independence in 1821 and merged with the [[Republic of Gran Colombia]] (from 1821 to 1903).\n \nIn the Viceroyalty of New Spain, free-thinking secular priest, [[Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla]], declared Mexican freedom in 1810 in the [[Grito de Dolores]]. Independence was actually won in 1821 by a royalist army officer turned insurgent, [[Agust\u00edn de Iturbide]], in alliance with insurgent [[Vicente Guerrero]] and under the [[Plan of Iguala]]. The conservative Catholic hierarchy in [[New Spain]] supported Mexican independence largely because it found the liberal Spanish [[Constitution of 1812]] abhorrent. Central America provinces became independent via Mexico's independence in 1821 and joined Mexico for a brief time (1822\u201323), but they chose their own path when Mexico became a republic in 1824.\n\nThe Spanish coastal fortifications in Veracruz, Callao and Chilo\u00e9 were the footholds that resisted until 1825 and 1826 respectively. In Spanish America, Royalist guerrillas continued the war in several countries, and Spain launched attempts to retake Venezuela in 1827 and Mexico in 1829. Spain  abandoned all plans of military re-conquest at the death of King Ferdinand VII in [[1833]]. Finally the Spanish government went so far as to renounce sovereignty over all of continental America in 1836.\n\n===Loss of Remnants in the Indies (1865-1899)===\n\n[[Dominican Republic|Santo Domingo]] likewise declared independence in 1821 and began negotiating for inclusion in Bolivar's [[Republic of Gran Colombia]], but was quickly occupied by [[Haiti]], which ruled it until [[Dominican War of Independence|an 1844 revolution]]. After 17 years of independence, in 1861, Santo Domingo was again [[Spanish occupation of the Dominican Republic|made a colony]] due to Haitian aggression, making it the only former colony that Spain retook. However, Captain-General [[Jos\u00e9 de la G\u00e1ndara y Navarro]] met opposition to his occupation of the island after his troops faced both guerrilla uprisings and [[yellow fever]]. In all, 10,888 of G\u00e1ndara's forces fell in combat against [[Dominican Restoration War|Dominican guerrillas]]. More devastating was disease, which claimed 30,000 Spaniards.\n\nAfter 1865, only Cuba and Puerto Rico and the [[Spanish East Indies]] (the [[Philippines]], [[Guam]] and nearby Pacific islands) remained under Spanish control in the Indies. The Cuban war for independence was cut short by U.S. intervention in what became known as the [[Spanish\u2013American War]] in 1898. Spain also lost Puerto Rico and the Philippines in that conflict.<ref name=\"avalon\">[http://avalon.law.yale.edu/19th_century/sp1898.asp Law.yale.edu: Treaty of Peace Between the United States and Spain]</ref> The following year, Spain then sold its remaining Pacific Ocean possessions to Germany in the [[German-Spanish Treaty (1899)|German\u2013Spanish Treaty]], retaining only its African territories.\n\n[[File:Spain in 1898.png|thumb|upright=1.35|The Spanish Empire in 1898]]\n\nSpain in the post-Napoleonic era was in political crisis, with the French invasion and restoration of the Spanish monarchy under the autocratic Ferdinand VII having broken apart any traditional consensus on sovereignty, fragmented the country politically and regionally and unleashed wars and disputes between progressives, liberals and conservatives. The instability inhibited Spain's development, which had started fitfully gathering pace in the eighteenth century. A brief period of improvement occurred in the 1870s when the capable [[Alfonso XII of Spain]] and his thoughtful ministers succeeded in restoring some vigor to Spanish politics and prestige, cut short by Alfonso's early death.\n\nAn increasing level of [[Spanish nationalism|nationalist]], anti-colonial uprisings in various colonies culminated with the Spanish\u2013American War of 1898, fought primarily over Cuba.

The following decades of Franco-Spanish collaboration resulted in the establishment and extension of Spanish protectorates south of the city, and Spanish influence obtained international recognition in the [[Berlin Conference]] of 1884: Spain administered Sidi Ifni and [[Western Sahara]] jointly. Spain claimed a [[protectorate]] over the coast of Guinea from [[Cape Bojador]] to [[Ras Nouadhibou|Cap Blanc]], too, and even try to press a claim over the [[Adrar (region)|Adrar]] and [[Tiris Zemmour Region|Tiris]] regions in [[Mauritania]].

The ''[[Battle of Annual]]'' (1921) during the [[Rif War]] was a sudden, grave, and almost fatal military defeat suffered by the Spanish army against Moroccan insurgents.

In 1931, following the fall of the monarchy, the African colonies became part of the [[Second Spanish Republic]]. In 1934, during the government of Prime Minister [[Alejandro Lerroux]], Spanish troops led by General Osvaldo Capaz landed in Sidi Ifni and carried out the occupation of the territory, ceded ''[[de jure]]'' by Morocco in 1860. Five years later, [[Francisco Franco]], a general of the [[Army of Africa (Spain)|Army of Africa]], rebelled against the republican government and started the [[Spanish Civil War]] (1936\u201339). During the Second World War the [[Vichy French]] presence in Tangier was overcome by that of [[Francoist Spain]].\n\nSpain lacked the wealth and the interest to develop an extensive economic infrastructure in its African colonies during the first half of the 20th century. However, through a [[Paternalism|paternalistic]] system, particularly on [[Bioko Island]], Spain developed large [[Cocoa bean|cocoa]] plantations for which thousands of [[Nigeria]]n workers were imported as laborers.\n\n[[File:ProtectoradoMarruecos.png|thumb|upright=1.1|left|[[Morocco]] and Spanish territories]]\n\nIn 1956, when [[French Morocco]] became independent, Spain surrendered [[Spanish Morocco]] to the new nation, but retained control of Sidi Ifni, the [[Tarfaya]] region and [[Spanish Sahara]]. Moroccan [[Sultan]] (later King) [[Mohammed V of Morocco|Mohammed V]] was interested in these territories and invaded Spanish Sahara in 1957, in the [[Ifni War]], or in Spain, the Forgotten War (''{{lang|es|la Guerra Olvidada}}''). In 1958, Spain ceded Tarfaya to Mohammed V and joined the previously separate districts of [[Saguia el-Hamra]] (in the north) and [[R\u00edo de Oro]] (in the south) to form the province of [[Spanish Sahara]].\n\nIn 1959, the Spanish territory on the [[Gulf of Guinea]] was established with a status similar to the provinces of metropolitan Spain. As the Spanish Equatorial Region, it was ruled by a [[governor general]] exercising military and civilian powers. The first local elections were held in 1959, and the first Equatoguinean representatives were seated in the [[Cortes Generales|Spanish parliament]]. Under the Basic Law of December 1963, limited autonomy was authorized under a joint legislative body for the territory's two provinces. The name of the country was changed to [[Equatorial Guinea]]. In March 1968, under pressure from Equatoguinean nationalists and the United Nations, Spain announced that it would grant the country independence.\n\nIn 1969, under international pressure, Spain returned Sidi Ifni to Morocco. Spanish control of Spanish Sahara endured until the 1975 [[Green March]] prompted a withdrawal, under Moroccan military pressure. The future of this former Spanish colony remains uncertain.\n\nThe [[Canary Islands]] and Spanish cities in the African mainland are considered an equal part of Spain and the [[European Union]] but have a different tax system.\n\nMorocco still claims Ceuta, Melilla, and ''{{lang|es|[[plazas de soberan\u00eda]]}}'' even though they are internationally recognized as administrative divisions of Spain.

[[London (Samuel Johnson poem)|Writing in 1738]], English poet [[Samuel Johnson]] questioned, \"Has heaven reserved, in pity to the poor,/No pathless waste or undiscovered shore,/No secret island in the boundless main,/No peaceful desert yet unclaimed by Spain?\"<ref>quoted in Simon Collier, \"The Spanish Conquests, 1492\u20131580\" in ''The Cambridge Encyclopedia of Latin America and the Caribbean''.

With over 470 million native speakers today, [[Spanish language|Spanish]] is the second [[List of languages by number of native speakers|most spoken native language]] in the world, as result of the introduction of the language of Castile\u2014Castilian, \"''Castellano''\" \u2014from Iberia to Spanish America, later expanded by the governments of successor independent republics. In the Philippines, the [[Spanish\u2013American War]] (1898) brought the islands under U.S. jurisdiction, with English being imposed in schools and Spanish becoming [[Languages of the Philippines|a secondary official language]].\n\n[[File:De espa\u00f1ol e india, mestiza.jpg|thumb|150px|A painting showing a Spanish man with a [[Native South American|Native American]] wife and their child. Mixed-race European Amerindians were referred to as [[Mestizo]]s.|left]]\n\nAn important cultural legacy of the Spanish empire overseas is [[Roman Catholicism]], which remains the main religious faith in Spanish America and the Philippines. Christian evangelization of indigenous peoples was a key responsibility of the crown and a justification for its imperial expansion. Although indigenous were considered neophytes and insufficiently mature in their faith for indigenous men to be ordained to the priesthood, the indigenous were part of the Catholic community of faith. Catholic orthodoxy enforced by the [[Holy Office of the Inquisition|Inquisition]], particularly targeting [[crypto-Jews]] and Protestants. Not until after their independence in the nineteenth century did Spanish American republics allow [[religious toleration]] of other faiths. Observances of Catholic holidays often have strong regional expressions and remain important in many parts of Spanish America. Observances include [[Day of the Dead]], [[Carnaval de Oruro|Carnival]], [[Holy Week in Popay\u00e1n|Holy Week]], [[Dancing devils of Corpus Christi|Corpus Christi]], [[Epiphany (holiday)|Epiphany]], and national saints' days, such as the [[Virgin of Guadalupe]] in Mexico.\n\nPolitically, the colonial era has strongly influenced modern Spanish America. The territorial divisions of the empire in Spanish America became the basis for boundaries between new republics after independence and for state divisions within countries. It is often argued that the rise of [[Caudillo|caudillismo]] during and after Latin American independence movements created a legacy of authoritarianism in the region.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Chiaramonte|first=Jos\u00e9 Carlos|date=2010-08-01|title=The \"Ancient Constitution\" after Independence (1808\u20131852)|journal=Hispanic American Historical Review|language=en|volume=90|issue=3|pages=455\u2013488|doi=10.1215/00182168-2010-003|issn=0018-2168}}</ref> There was no significant development of representative institutions during the colonial era, and the executive power was often made stronger than the legislative power during the national period as a result. Unfortunately, this has led to a popular misconception that the colonial legacy has caused the region to have an extremely oppressed proletariat. Revolts and riots are often seen as evidence of this supposed extreme oppression. However, the culture of revolting against an unpopular government is not simply a confirmation of widespread authoritarianism. The colonial legacy did leave a political culture of revolt, but not always as a desperate last act. The civil unrest of the region is seen by some as a form of political involvement. While the political context of the political revolutions in Spanish America is understood to be one in which liberal elites competed to form new national political structures, so too were those elites responding to mass lower-class political mobilization and participation.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hamnett|first=Brian R.|date=1997|title=Process and Pattern: A Re-Examination of the Ibero-American Independence Movements, 1808-1826|journal=Journal of Latin American Studies|volume=29|issue=2|pages=279\u2013328|issn=0022-216X|jstor=158396|doi=10.1017/S0022216X97004719}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Murales Rivera - Treppenhaus 3 Kaiser Maximilian.jpg|thumb|Detail of a Mural by [[Diego Rivera]] at the [[National Palace (Mexico)|National Palace of Mexico]] showing the ethnic differences between [[Agust\u00edn de Iturbide]], a ''[[Criollo people|criollo]]'', and the [[multiracial]] Mexican court]]\n\nHundreds of towns and cities in the Americas were founded during the Spanish rule, with the colonial centers and buildings of many of them now designated as [[UNESCO World Heritage Sites]] attracting tourists. The tangible heritage includes universities, forts, cities, cathedrals, schools, hospitals, missions, government buildings and colonial residences, many of which still stand today. A number of present-day roads, canals, ports or bridges sit where Spanish engineers built them centuries ago. The oldest universities in the Americas were founded by Spanish scholars and Catholic missionaries. The Spanish Empire also left a vast [[Hispanic|cultural and linguistic legacy]]. The cultural legacy is also present in the [[music of Latin America|music]], [[cuisine]], and [[fashion]], some of which have been granted the status of [[UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists|UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage]].\n\nThe long colonial period in [[Hispanic America|Spanish America]] resulted in a mixing of indigenous peoples, Europeans, and Africans that were [[casta|classified by race and hierarchically ranked]], therefore there was a mixed race society in the Spanish and Portuguese Americas compared to the starkly segregated settler colonies of the British and French in North America.\n\nIn concert with the [[Portuguese Empire]], the Spanish Empire laid the foundations of a truly global trade by opening up the great trans-oceanic trade routes and the exploration of unknown territories and oceans for the western knowledge. The [[Spanish Dollar]] became the world's first global currency.\n\nOne of the features of this trade was the exchange of a great array of domesticated plants and animals between the Old World and the New in the [[Columbian Exchange]]. Some cultivars that were introduced to America included grapes, wheat, barley, apples and citrous fruits; animals that were introduced to the New World were horses, donkeys, cattle, sheep, goats, pigs, and chickens. The Old World received from America such things as maize, potatoes, chili peppers, tomatoes, tobacco, beans, squash, cacao (chocolate), vanilla, avocados, pineapples, chewing gum, rubber, peanuts, cashews, Brazil nuts, pecans, blueberries, strawberries, quinoa, amaranth, chia, agave and others. The result of these exchanges was to significantly improve the agricultural potential of not only in America, but also that of Europe and Asia. Diseases brought by Europeans and Africans, such as smallpox, measles, typhus, and others, devastated almost all indigenous populations that had no immunity, with [[syphilis]] the exchange from the New World to Old.\n\nThere were also cultural influences, which can be seen in everything from architecture to food, music, art and law, from Southern [[Argentina]] and [[Chile]] to the [[United States|United States of America]] together with the [[Philippines]]. The complex origins and contacts of different peoples resulted in cultural influences coming together in the varied forms so evident today in the former colonial areas.\n\n== See also

Their dynastic alliance was important for a number of reasons, ruling jointly over a large aggregation of territories although not in a unitary fashion. They successfully pursued expansion in Iberia in the Christian [[Reconquista|Reconquest]] of the Muslim [[Kingdom of Granada]], completed in 1492. This conquest is often called the \u201cChristian Reconquest\u201d due to the different religions of the ruling class of both kingdoms. Since the Kingdom of Granada was the last moorish kingdom in the peninsula, Valencia-born Pope [[Alexander VI]] gave them the title of the [[Catholic Monarchs]]. However, it is important to realize that the Kingdom of Granada and its surrounding kingdoms had been part of Muslim caliphates for over seven centuries. The term \u201creconquest\u201d perpetrates a false idea that the peninsula somehow belonged to Catholics. In reality, even though religion may have played a part in the conquest, the fact of the matter was that southern expansion was partially motivated by traditional reasons as well, such as wealth and land. However, due to the prioritization of the religious aspect, the term \u201cChristian reconquest\u201d is still used to describe the event. Ferdinand of Aragon was particularly concerned with expansion in France and Italy, as well as conquests in North Africa.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |first=Aram |last=Bethany |title=Monarchs of Spain |encyclopedia=Iberia and the Americas: culture, politics, and history|location=Santa Barbara |publisher=ABC Clio |year=2006 |page= 725}}</ref>\n\nWith the Ottoman Turks controlling the choke points of the overland trade from Asia and the Middle East, both Spain and Portugal sought alternative routes. The [[Kingdom of Portugal]] had an advantage over the rest of Iberian, having earlier retaken territory from the Muslims. Portugal completed Christian reconquest in 1238 and settling the kingdom's boundaries. Portugal then began to seek further overseas expansion, first to the port of [[Ceuta]] (1415) and then by colonizing the Atlantic islands of [[Madeira]] (1418) and the [[Azores]] (1427-1452); it also began voyages down the west coast of Africa in the fifteenth century.<ref>Dutra, Francis A. \"Portuguese Empire\" in {{harvnb|Encyclopedia of Latin American History and Culture|1996|loc=vol. 4, p. 451}}</ref> Its rival Castile laid claim to the [[Canary Islands]] (1402) and retook territory from the Moors in 1462. The Christian rivals, Castile and Portugal, came to formal agreements over the division of new territories in the [[Treaty of Alca\u00e7ovas]] (1479), as well as securing the crown of Castile for Isabella, whose accession was challenged militarily by Portugal.\n\nFollowing the voyage of [[Christopher Columbus]] in 1492 and first major settlement in the [[New World]] in 1493, Portugal and Castile divided the world by the [[Treaty of Tordesillas]] (1494), which gave Portugal Africa and Asia and the Western Hemisphere to Spain.<ref name=\"Burkholder Empire\">Burkholder, Mark A. \"Spanish Empire\" in {{harvnb|Encyclopedia of Latin American History and Culture|1996|loc=vol. 5, p. 167}}</ref> The voyage of [[Christopher Columbus]], a [[Genoa|Genoese]] mariner married to a Portuguese woman in Lisbon, obtained the support of Isabella of Castile, sailing west in 1492, seeking a route to the Indies. Columbus unexpectedly encountered the western hemisphere, populated by peoples he named \"Indians.\" Subsequent voyages and full-scale settlements of Spaniards followed, with gold beginning to flow into Castile's coffers. Managing the expanding empire became an administrative issue. The reign of Ferdinand and Isabella began the professionalization of the apparatus of government in Spain, which led to a demand for men of letters (''letrados'') who were university graduates (''licenciados''), of [[University of Salamanca|Salamanca]], [[University of Valladolid|Valladolid]], [[Complutense University of Madrid|Complutense]] and [[University of Alcal\u00e1|Alcal\u00e1]]. These lawyer-bureaucrats staffed the various councils of state, eventually including the [[Council of the Indies]] and [[Casa de Contrataci\u00f3n]], the two highest bodies in metropolitan Spain for the government of the empire in the New World, as well as royal government in The Indies.\n\n=== Conquest and subsequent colonization of Andalusia ===\n{{unreferenced section|date=February 2020}}\nWhen King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella conquered the Iberian peninsula, they had to implement policies to maintain control of the newly gained territory. To do so, the monarchy implemented a system of encomienda. This iteration of the encomienda system was land based, with tributary and land rights given to different noble families. This eventually led to a large land based aristocracy, a separate ruling class that the crown later tried to eliminate in its overseas colonies. By implementing this method of political organization, the crown was able to implement new forms of private property without completely replacing already existing systems, such as the communal use of resources. \nAfter the military and political conquest, there was an emphasis on religious conquest as well, leading to the creation of the  Spanish Inquisition. Although the Inquisition was technically a part of the Catholic church, the Ferdinand and Isabella formed a separate Spanish Inquisition, which led to mass expulsion of Muslims and Jews from the peninsula. This religious court system was later adopted and transported to the Americas, though they took a less effective role there due to limited jurisdiction and large territories.\n\n=== Campaigns in North Africa ===\n{{See also|European enclaves in North Africa before 1830}}\nWith the Christian reconquest completed in the Iberian peninsula, Spain began trying to take territory in Muslim North Africa. It had conquered [[Melilla]] in 1497, and further expansionism policy in North Africa was developed during the regency of Ferdinand the Catholic in Castile, stimulated by the [[Francisco Jim\u00e9nez de Cisneros|Cardinal Cisneros]]. Several towns and outposts in the North African coast were conquered and occupied by Castile: [[Mers El K\u00e9bir|Mazalquivir]] (1505), [[Pe\u00f1\u00f3n de V\u00e9lez de la Gomera]] (1508), [[Oran]] (1509), [[Algiers]] (1510), [[Bejaia|Bougie]] and [[Tripoli, Libya|Tripoli]] (1510). On the Atlantic coast, Spain took possession of the outpost of [[Santa Cruz de la Mar Peque\u00f1a]] (1476) with support from the [[Canary Islands]], and it was retained until 1525 with the consent of the treaty of Cintra (1509).\n\n=== Navarre and Struggles for Italy ===\n{{See also|Italian Wars}}\n[[File:Elgrancapitantrasbatalladeceri\u00f1ola.jpg|thumb|[[Gonzalo Fern\u00e1ndez de C\u00f3rdoba|El gran capit\u00e1n]] at the [[Battle of Cerignola]].]]\n\nThe Catholic Monarchs had developed a strategy of marriages for their children in order to isolate their long-time enemy: France. The Spanish princesses married the heirs of Portugal, England and the [[House of Habsburg]]. Following the same strategy, the Catholic Monarchs decided to support the Aragonese house of [[Naples]] against [[Charles VIII of France]] in the [[Italian Wars]] beginning in 1494. As [[King of Aragon]], Ferdinand had been involved in the struggle against France and [[Republic of Venice|Venice]] for control of Italy; these conflicts became the center of Ferdinand's foreign policy as king. In these battles, which established the supremacy of the [[Tercio|Spanish Tercios]] in European battlefields, the forces of the kings of Spain acquired a reputation for invincibility that would last until the mid-17th century.\n\nAfter the death of Queen Isabella in 1504, and her exclusion of Ferdinand from a further role in Castile, Ferdinand married [[Germaine de Foix]] in 1505, cementing an alliance with France. Had that couple had a surviving heir, likely the [[Crown of Aragon]] would have been split from Castile, which was inherited by Charles, Ferdinand and Isabella's grandson.{{sfn|Edwards|2000|pages=282\u201388}} Ferdinand adopted a more aggressive policy toward Italy, attempting to enlarge Spain's sphere of influence there. Ferdinand's first deployment of Spanish forces came in the [[War of the League of Cambrai]] against [[Republic of Venice|Venice]], where the Spanish soldiers distinguished themselves on the field alongside their French allies at the [[Battle of Agnadello]] (1509). Only a year later, Ferdinand became part of the [[Catholic League (Italian)|Holy League]] against France, seeing a chance at taking both [[Milan]] \u2014 to which he held a dynastic claim \u2013 and [[Navarre]]. This war was less of a success than the war against Venice, and in 1516, France agreed to a truce that left Milan in its control and recognized Spanish control of [[Upper Navarre]], which had effectively been a Spanish protectorate following a series of treaties in 1488, 1491, 1493, and 1495.{{sfn|Edwards|2000|p=248}}\n\n=== Canary Islands ===\n{{Main|Conquest of the Canary Islands}}\n[[File:Parlamento 04.jpg|thumb|upright|The conquest of the [[Canary Islands]] (1402-1496)]]\n\nPortugal obtained several [[Papal bull]]s that acknowledged Portuguese control over the discovered territories, but Castile also obtained from the Pope the safeguard of its rights to the [[Canary Islands]] with the bulls ''Romani Pontifex'' dated 6 November 1436 and ''Dominatur Dominus'' dated 30 April 1437.<ref>{{cite book |last=Casta\u00f1eda Delgado |first=Paulino |title=La Teocracia Pontifical en las controversias sobre el Nuevo Mundo |publisher=Universidad Aut\u00f3noma de M\u00e9xico |year=1996 |chapter=La Santa Sede ante las empresas mar\u00edtimas ib\u00e9ricas |chapterurl=http://www.bibliojuridica.org/libros/2/725/14.pdf |isbn=978-968-36-5153-2 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927135626/http://www.bibliojuridica.org/libros/2/725/14.pdf |archivedate=27 September 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The [[conquest of the Canary Islands]], inhabited by [[guanches|Guanche]] people, began in 1402 during the reign of [[Henry III of Castile]], by [[Normandy|Norman]] nobleman [[Jean de B\u00e9thencourt]] under a feudal agreement with the crown.

Founded in 1510, the city is the oldest continuously-inhabited European city in the continental Americas.]]\n\nWith the [[Capitulations of Santa Fe]], the [[Crown of Castile]] granted expansive power to [[Christopher Columbus]], including exploration, settlement, political power, and revenues, with sovereignty reserved to the Crown. The first voyage established sovereignty for the crown, and the crown acted on the assumption that Columbus's grandiose assessment of what he found was true, so Spain negotiated the [[Treaty of Tordesillas]] with Portugal to protect their territory on the Spanish side of the line. The crown fairly quickly reassessed its relationship with Columbus and moved to assert more direct crown control over the territory and extinguish his privileges. With that lesson learned, the crown was far more prudent in the specifying the terms of exploration, conquest, and settlement in new areas.\n\nThe pattern in the Caribbean that played out over the larger Spanish Indies was exploration of an unknown area and claim of sovereignty for the crown; conquest of indigenous peoples or assumption of control without direct violence; settlement by Spaniards who were awarded the labour of indigenous people via the [[encomienda]]; and the existing settlements becoming the launch point for further exploration, conquest, and settlement, followed by the establishment institutions with officials appointed by the crown. The patterns set in the Caribbean were replicated throughout the expanding Spanish sphere, so although the importance of the Caribbean quickly faded after the [[Spanish conquest of the Aztec empire]] and the [[Spanish conquest of Peru]], many of those participating in those conquests had started their exploits in the Caribbean.{{sfn|Lockhart|Schwartz|1983|pages=61\u201385}}\n\nThe first permanent European settlements in the New World were established in the Caribbean, initially on the island of [[Hispaniola]], later Cuba and Puerto Rico. As a Genoese with the connections to Portugal, Columbus considered settlement to be on the pattern of trading forts and factories, with salaried employees to trade with locals and to identify exploitable resources.{{sfn|Lockhart|Schwartz|1983|p= 62}} However, Spanish settlement in the New World was based on a pattern of a large, permanent settlements with the entire complex of institutions and material life to replicate Castilian life in a different venue. Columbus's second voyage in 1493 had a large contingent of settlers and goods to accomplish that.{{sfn|Lockhart|Schwartz|1983|p=63}} On Hispaniola, the city of [[Ciudad Colonial (Santo Domingo)|Santo Domingo]] was founded in 1496 by Christopher Columbus's brother [[Bartholomew Columbus]] and became a stone-built, permanent city.\n\n===Assertion of Crown control in the Americas===\nAlthough Columbus staunchly asserted and believed that the lands he encountered were in Asia, the paucity of material wealth and the relative lack of complexity of indigenous society meant that the [[Crown of Castile]] initially was not concerned with the extensive powers granted Columbus. As the Caribbean became a draw for Spanish settlement and as Columbus and his extended Genoese family failed to be recognized as officials worthy of the titles they held, there was unrest among Spanish settlers. The crown began to curtail the expansive powers that they had granted Columbus, first by appointment of royal governors and then a high court or [[Real Audiencia|Audiencia]] in 1511.\n\nColumbus encountered the mainland in 1498,{{sfn|Diego-Fern\u00e1ndez Sotelo|1987|p= 139}} and the Catholic Monarchs learned of his discovery in May 1499. Taking advantage of a revolt against Columbus in [[Hispaniola]], they appointed [[Francisco de Bobadilla]] as governor of the Indies with civil and criminal jurisdiction over the lands discovered by Columbus.

Charles was also Holy Roman Emperor via his paternal line and, at his abdication, his son [[Philip II of Spain]] inherited also [[Franche-Comt\u00e9]] and the [[Habsburg Netherlands]], turning these territories into a ''[[Spanish Road]]'' in Western Europe. Philip centralized the administration of the Spanish empire in [[Madrid]], initiating a cultural and political golden age for Spain (known in Spanish as the ''{{lang|es|[[Siglo de Oro]]}}'') while becoming known as the \"Prudent King\", and inherited also the [[Portuguese Empire]] in 1580.\n\nThe Habsburgs pursued several goals:\n* Undermining the power of France and containing it in its eastern borders\n* Defending Europe against [[Islam]], notably the [[Ottoman Empire]] in the [[Ottoman\u2013Habsburg wars]]\n* Maintaining [[House of Habsburg|Habsburg]] [[hegemony]] in the [[Holy Roman Empire]] and defending the [[Roman Catholic Church]] against the [[Protestant Reformation]]\n* Spreading (Catholic) Christianity to the unconverted indigenous of the [[New World]] and the [[Philippines]]\n* Exploiting the resources of the Americas (gold, silver, sugar) and trading with Asia ([[porcelain]], spices, silk)\n* Excluding other European powers from the possessions it claimed in the [[New World]]\n\nSpain came across an imperial reality without finding profits at the beginning. It did stimulate some trade and industry, but the trading opportunities encountered were limited. Therefore, Spain started to invest in America with the creation of cities, because Spain was in America due to religious reasons. Matters began to change in the 1520s with the large-scale extraction of silver from the rich deposits of Mexico's [[Guanajuato]] region, but it was the opening of the silver mines in Mexico's [[Zacatecas]] and [[Potos\u00ed]] in Upper Peru (modern-day Bolivia) in 1546 that became legendary. During the 16th century, Spain held the equivalent of US$1.5 trillion (1990 terms) in gold and silver received from [[New Spain]]. These imports contributed to [[price revolution|inflation]] in Spain and Europe from the last decades of the 16th century. The vast imports of silver also made local manufactures uncompetitive and ultimately made Spain overly dependent on foreign sources of [[raw material]]s and [[manufactured goods]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} \"I learnt a proverb here\", said a French traveler in 1603: \"Everything is dear in Spain except silver\".<ref>Quoted in {{harvnb|Braudel|1984|loc=vol 2., p. 171}}.</ref> The problems caused by inflation were discussed by scholars at the [[School of Salamanca]] and the ''[[arbitrista]]s''.

He was the first Habsburg monarch of Spain and co-ruler of Spain with his mother. Charles had been raised in northern Europe and his interests remained those of Christian Europe. The continuing threat of the Ottoman Turks in the Mediterranean and Central Europe also occupied the monarch. While not directly an inheritance, Charles was elected emperor of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] after the death of his grandfather [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Maximilian]] thanks to prodigious bribes paid to the prince-electors. Charles became the most powerful Christian ruler in Europe, but his Ottoman rival, [[Suleiman the Magnificent]], challenged Charles for primacy in Europe. France made an unprecedented but pragmatic alliance with the Muslim Ottomans against Habsburg political power and the Ottomans assisted German Protestant princes in the religious conflicts tearing Christian unity apart in Northern Europe. Simultaneously, the overseas lands claimed by Spain in the New World proved to be a source of wealth and the crown was able to assert greater control over its overseas possessions in the political and religious spheres than was possible on Iberian peninsula or in Europe. The conquests of the [[Aztec Empire]] and the [[Inca Empire]] brought vast indigenous civilizations into the Spanish Empire and the mineral wealth, particularly silver, were identified and exploited, becoming the economic lifeblood of the crown. Under Charles, Spain and its overseas empire in the Americas became deeply entwined, with the crown enforcing Catholic exclusivity; exercising crown primacy in political rule, unencumbered by claims of an existing aristocracy; and defending its claims against other European powers.{{sfn|Burbank|Cooper|2010|p= 144-45}} In 1558 he abdicated his throne of Spain to his son, [[Philip II of Spain|Philip]], leaving the ongoing conflicts to his heir.\n\n==== Struggles for Italy ====\n{{See also|Italian Wars}}\n[[File:Battle of Pavia.jpg|thumb|[[Battle of Pavia]]]]\n\nWith the ascent of [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles I]] in 1516 and his election as sovereign of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] in 1519, [[Francis I of France]] found himself surrounded by Habsburg territories. He invaded the Imperial possessions in Italy in 1521, inaugurating the [[Italian War of 1521\u20131526|second war]] of the [[French-Habsburg rivalry]]. The war was a disaster for France, which suffered defeat in the [[Battle of Biccoca]] (1522), the [[Battle of Pavia]] (1525), in which Francis I was captured and imprisoned in Madrid,<ref>{{cite book|last1=Presa Gonz\u00e1lez |first1=Fernanado |last2=Grenda |first2=Agnieszka Matyjaszczyk |title=Madrid a los ojos de los viajeros polacos : un siglo de estampas literarias de la Villa y Corte (1850\u20131961) |language=es |date=2003 |publisher=Huerga & Fierro |location=Madrid |isbn=9788483744161|edition=  1st}}</ref> and in the [[Battle of Landriano]] (1529) before Francis relented and abandoned [[Milan]] to the Empire. Charles later gave the imperial fief of Milan to his Spanish son Philip.\n\nThe papacy and Charles had complicated relations. Charles's forces were victorious at the [[Battle of Pavia]] in 1525. [[Pope Clement VII]] switched sides and joined forces with France and prominent Italian states against the Habsburg Emperor, resulting in the [[War of the League of Cognac]]. Charles grew exhausted with the pope's meddling in what he viewed as purely secular affairs. In 1527, Charles's army in northern Italy, underpaid and desiring to plunder the city of Rome, mutinied, advanced southward toward Rome, and looted the city. The [[Sack of Rome (1527)|Sack of Rome]], while unintended by Charles, embarrassed the papacy sufficiently enough that Clement, and succeeding popes, were considerably more circumspect in their dealings with secular authorities.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} In 1533, Clement's refusal to annul the first marriage of King [[Henry VIII of England]] to Charles's aunt, [[Catherine of Aragon]], may have been partly or entirely motivated by his unwillingness to offend the emperor and perhaps have his city sacked for a second time. The [[Peace of Barcelona]], signed between Charles V and the Pope in 1529, established a more cordial relationship between the two leaders. Charles was effectively named the protector of the Catholic cause, and he was crowned as [[King of Italy]] ([[Lombardy]]) by the Medici [[Pope Clement VII]] in return for [[Siege of Florence (1529\u201330)|his intervention]] in overthrowing the rebellious [[Florence|Florentine]] Republic.\n\nThe crowns of Castile and Aragon depended on Genoese bankers for its finances and the Genoese fleet aided the Spanish in fighting the Ottomans in the Mediterranean.{{sfn|Burbank|Cooper|2010|p= 121}}\n\n==== Ottoman Turks during Charles V's rule ====\n\n{{See also|Conquest of Tunis (1535)|Battle of Preveza|Siege of Castelnuovo|Algiers expedition (1541)}}\n[[File:Columnas Plus Ultra.png|thumb|The [[Pillars of Hercules]] with the motto \"[[Plus Ultra (motto)|Plus Ultra]]\" (\"further beyond\") as symbol of the [[Holy Roman Emperor]] [[Charles I of Spain|Charles V]] in the town hall of [[Seville]] (16th century).

The most common hypothesis of the origin of the [[Dollar sign]].]]\nBy the 16th century, the [[Ottomans]] had become a threat to the states of Western Europe. They had defeated the eastern Christian Byzantine empire and seized its capital, creating it as the Ottoman capital and the Ottomans controlled a rich area of the eastern Mediterranean, with links to Asia, Egypt, and India and in by the mid-sixteenth century, they ruled a third of Europe. The Ottomans had created an impressive land and maritime empire, with port cities and short and long range trade connections.{{sfn|Burbank|Cooper|2010|p= 132}} Charles's great rival was [[Suleiman the Magnificent]], whose rule almost exactly coincided with Charles's. A contemporary Spanish writer, [[Francisco L\u00f3pez de G\u00f3mara]], compared Charles unfavorably with Suleiman in the 1540s, saying that although both were wealthy and pursued war, \"the Turks succeeded better at fulfilling their projects than did the Spanish; they devoted themselves more fully to the order and discipline of war, they were better advised, they used their money more effectively.\"<ref>quoted in {{harvnb|Burbank|Cooper|2010|p= 119}}</ref>\n\nIn 1535, Charles assembled an invasion force of 60,000 troops and 398 ships from the Habsburg domains, Genoa, Portugal, the Papal States, and the Knights of St. John, and he had this force invade [[Tunis]] in North Africa, from which the Ottomans and their corsairs launched several raids against the Christian states of the Mediterranean. The Habsburgs destroyed the Ottoman fleet in the harbor before besieging the fortress of La Goletta. After the Habsburg forces conquered the city of Tunis, they massacred 30,000 Muslim civilians.\n\n[[Pope Paul III]] assembled a league consisting of the [[Republic of Venice]], the [[Duchy of Mantua]], the Spanish Empire, Portugal, the [[Papal States]], the [[Republic of Genoa]], and the [[Knights of St. John]], but this coalition was defeated at the 1538 [[Battle of Preveza]], and it soon disbanded.\n\nIn 1543, Francis I of France announced his unprecedented alliance with the Islamic sultan of the [[Ottoman Empire]], [[Suleiman the Magnificent]], by occupying the Spanish-controlled [[Siege of Nice|city of Nice]] in concert with Ottoman Turk forces. Henry VIII of England, who bore a greater grudge against France than he held against Charles for standing in the way of his divorce, joined him in his invasion of France. Although the Spanish were defeated at the [[Battle of Ceresole]] in Savoy, the French army was unable to seriously threaten Spanish-controlled Milan, while suffering defeat in the north at the hands of Henry, thereby being forced to accept unfavorable terms. The Austrians, led by Charles's younger brother [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand]], continued to fight the Ottomans in the east.\n\nThe presence of Spain in North Africa declined during Charles's reign, though [[Tunis]] and its port, [[La Goleta]], were taken in 1535. One after another, most of the Spanish possessions were lost: Pe\u00f1\u00f3n de V\u00e9lez de la Gomera (1522), Santa Cruz de Mar Peque\u00f1a (1524), Algiers (1529), Tripoli (1551), Bujia (1554), and La Goleta and Tunis (1569).\n\n==== Religious conflicts in the Holy Roman Empire ====\n{{unreferenced section|date=February 2020}}\n[[File:Habsburg Map 1547.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|Map of the dominion of the [[House of Habsburg|Habsburgs]] following the [[abdication]] of [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] (1556), as depicted in ''The Cambridge Modern History Atlas'' (1912); Habsburg lands are shaded green. From 1556 the lands in a line from the Netherlands, through to the east of France, to the south of Italy and [[Sardinia|the islands]] were retained by the [[Spanish Habsburgs]].]]\n\nThe [[Schmalkaldic League]] had allied itself to the French, and efforts in Germany to undermine the League had been rebuffed. Francis's defeat in 1544 led to the annulment of the alliance with the Protestants, and Charles took advantage of the opportunity. He first tried the path of negotiation at the [[Council of Trent]] in 1545, but the Protestant leadership, feeling betrayed by the stance taken by the Catholics at the council, went to war, led by the [[Saxony|Saxon]] [[Prince-elector|elector]] [[Maurice of Saxony|Maurice]].\n\nIn response, Charles invaded Germany at the head of a mixed Dutch\u2013Spanish army, hoping to restore the Imperial authority. The emperor personally inflicted a decisive defeat on the Protestants at the historic [[Battle of M\u00fchlberg]] in 1547. In 1555, Charles signed the [[Peace of Augsburg]] with the Protestant states and restored stability in Germany on his principle of ''{{lang|la|[[cuius regio, eius religio]]}}'', a position unpopular with Spanish and Italian clergymen. Charles's involvement in Germany would establish a role for Spain as protector of the Catholic, [[Habsburg]] cause in the [[Holy Roman Empire]]; the precedent would lead, seven decades later, to involvement in the war that would decisively end Spain as Europe's leading power.\n\n==== The Indies ====\n{{See also|Fall of Tenochtitlan|Battle of Cajamarca}}\nWhen Charles succeeded to the throne of Spain, Spain's overseas possessions in the New World were based in the Caribbean and the Spanish Main and consisted of a rapidly decreasing indigenous population, few resources of value to the crown, and a sparse Spanish settler population. The situation changed dramatically with the expedition of [[Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s]], who, with alliances with [[altepetl|city-states]] hostile to the [[Aztec Empire|Aztecs]] and thousands of indigenous Mexican warriors, [[Spanish conquest of the Aztec empire|conquered]] the Aztec Empire (1519-1521). Following the pattern established in Spain during the Christian [[Reconquista|reconquest]] of Islamic Spain, and in the Caribbean, the first European settlements in the Americas, conquerors divided up the indigenous population in private holdings ''[[encomienda]]s'' and exploited their labor. Central Mexico and later the Inca Empire of Peru gave Spain vast new indigenous populations to convert to Christianity and rule as vassals of the crown. Charles established the [[Council of the Indies]] in 1524 to oversee all of Castile's overseas possessions. Charles appointed a [[Viceroyalty of New Spain|viceroy in Mexico]] in 1535, capping the royal governance of the high court, ''[[Real Audiencia]]'', and treasury officials with the highest royal official. Following the conquest of Peru, in 1542 Charles likewise appointed a [[Viceroyalty of Peru|viceroy]]. Both officials were under the jurisdiction of the Council of the Indies. Charles promulgated the [[New Laws]] of 1542 to limit the power of the conqueror group to form a hereditary aristocracy that might challenge the power of the crown.\n\n[[File:Pyle pirates approaching ship.jpg|thumb|Pirates attacking a much larger Spanish [[galleon]]]]\n\n=== Philip II (r. 1556-1598) ===\n{{Main|Philip II of Spain}}\n[[File:Philip II portrait by Titian.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Philip II of Spain, Philip I of Portugal, portrait by [[Titian]]]]\nThe reign of [[Philip II of Spain]] was extremely important, with both major successes and failures. Philip was Charles V's only legitimate son. He did not become Holy Roman Emperor, but divided Habsburg possessions with his uncle [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand]]. Philip treated Castile as the foundation of his empire, but the population of Castile was never great enough to provide the soldiers needed to defend the Empire or settlers to populate it. When he married [[Mary I of England|Mary Tudor]], England was allied to Spain. He seized the throne of Portugal in 1580, creating the [[Iberian Union]] and bringing the entire Iberian peninsula under his personal rule.\n\nAccording to one of his biographers, it was entirely due to Philip that the Indies were brought under crown control, remaining Spanish until the wars of independence in the early nineteenth century and Catholic to the present era. His greatest failure was his inability to suppress the Dutch revolt, which was aided by English and French rivals. His militant Catholicism also played a major role in his actions, as did his inability to understand imperial finances. He inherited his father's debts and incurred his own pursuing religious wars, resulting in recurring state bankruptcies and dependence on foreign bankers.{{sfnm|Parker|1978|1p=115-118, 123-124|Archer|2002|2p= 251}} Although there was an enormous expansion of silver production in Peru and Mexico, it did not remain in the Indies or even in Spain itself, but rather much of it went to European merchant houses.

In 1571, Spanish and [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] [[warship]]s, joined by volunteers from across Europe led by Charles's natural son [[Don John of Austria]], annihilated the Ottoman fleet at the [[Battle of Lepanto (1571)|Battle of Lepanto]]. The battle ended the threat of Ottoman naval hegemony in the Mediterranean. Following the battle, Philip and the Ottomans concluded truce agreements.

Philip aggressively prosecuted the war against France, crushing a French army at the [[Battle of St. Quentin (1557)|Battle of St. Quentin]] in Picardy in 1558 and defeating Henry again at the [[Battle of Gravelines (1558)|Battle of Gravelines]].\nThe [[Peace of Cateau-Cambr\u00e9sis]], signed in 1559, permanently recognized Spanish claims in Italy. In the celebrations that followed the treaty, Henry was killed by a stray splinter from a lance. France was stricken for the next thirty years by chronic civil war and unrest (see [[French Wars of Religion]]) and, during this period, removed it from effectively competing with Spain and the Habsburg family in European power games. Freed from effective French opposition, Spain attained the apogee of its might and territorial reach in the period 1559\u20131643.\n\nThe time for rejoicing in Madrid was short-lived. In 1566, [[Calvinist]]-led riots in the Netherlands prompted the [[Fernando \u00c1lvarez de Toledo, 3rd Duke of Alba|Duke of Alba]] to march into the country to restore order. In 1568, [[William the Silent|William of Orange]], a German nobleman, led a failed attempt to drive Alba from the Netherlands. These battles are generally considered to signal the start of the [[Eighty Years' War]] that ended with the independence of the [[Dutch Republic|United Provinces]] in 1648. The Spanish, who derived a great deal of wealth from the Netherlands and particularly from the vital port of [[Antwerp]], were committed to restoring order and maintaining their hold on the provinces. According to [[Luc-Normand Tellier]], \"It is estimated that the port of Antwerp was earning the Spanish crown seven times more revenues than the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|Americas]].\"<ref>{{citation|title=Urban world history: an economic and geographical perspective|first1=Luc-Normand|last1=Tellier|publisher=PUQ|year=2009|isbn=978-2-7605-1588-8|page=308\n|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cXuCjDbxC1YC}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=cXuCjDbxC1YC&pg=PA308 Extract of page 308]</ref>\n\nFor Spain, the war became an endless quagmire, sometimes literally. In 1574, the Spanish army under [[Francisco de Valdez]] was repulsed from the [[Siege of Leiden]] after the Dutch broke the [[Dyke (construction)|dykes]], thus causing extensive flooding. Alba's son, [[Fadrique \u00c1lvarez de Toledo, 4th Duke of Alba|Fadrique \u00c1lvarez de Toledo]], committed shocking massacres at Zutphen, [[Massacre of Naarden|Naarden]], and Haarlem. In 1576, faced with the bills from his 80,000-man army of occupation in the Netherlands, the cost of his fleet that had won at Lepanto, together with the growing threat of [[piracy]] in the open seas reducing his income from his American colonies, Philip was forced to accept bankruptcy. The army in the Netherlands mutinied not long after, [[Sack of Antwerp|seizing Antwerp]] and looting the southern Netherlands. This \"[[Spanish Fury]]\" was used by William to reinforce his arguments to ally all the Netherlands' Provinces with him. The [[Union of Brussels]] was formed only to be dissolved later out of intolerance towards the religious diversity of its members. Calvinists began their wave of uncontrolled atrocities aimed at the Catholics. This divisiveness gave Spain the opportunity to send [[Alexander Farnese, Duke of Parma|Alexander Farnese]] with 20,000 well-trained troops into the Netherlands. Groningen, Breda, Campen, Dunkirk, Antwerp, and Brussels, among others, were put to siege. In January, 1579, a group of Catholic nobles formed a League for the protection of their religion and property. Later that same month Friesland, Gelderland, Groningen, Holland, Overijssel, Utrecht and Zeeland formed the [[Dutch Republic|United Provinces]] which became the Dutch [[Netherlands]] of today. The remaining provinces became the [[Spanish Netherlands]] and in the 19th century became [[Belgium]]. Farnese soon regained nearly all the Southern provinces for Spain.\n\nFurther north, the city of [[Maastricht]] was besieged on March 12, 1579. Farnese's attackers tunneled an extensive network of passages in order to enter the city beneath its walled defenses. The defenders dug tunnels to meet them. Battles were fought fiercely in caverns with limited maneuvering capabilities. Hundreds of besiegers were scalded or choked to death when boiling water was poured into the tunnels or fires were lit to fill them with smoke.<ref name=\"Durant\">{{cite book |title=The Age of Reason Begins: A History of European Civilization in the Period of Shakespeare, Bacon, Montaigne, Rembrandt, Galileo, and Descartes: 1558\u20131648 |publisher=Simon and Schuster |url=https://archive.org/details/ageofreasonbegin07dura_0|url-access=registration |page=[https://archive.org/details/ageofreasonbegin07dura_0/page/454 454] |isbn = 9780671013202|last1 = Durant|first1 = Will|last2 = Durant|first2 = Ariel|year = 1961}}</ref> In an attempt to mine the city, 500 of Farnese's own men were killed when the explosives detonated prematurely.<ref name=Durant/> It took more than four months but the besiegers finally breached the wall and entered the city at night.

The failure of the expedition depleted the financial resources of England's treasury, which had been carefully restored during the long reign of Elizabeth I.\n\nSpain had invested itself in the religious warfare in France after Henry II's death. In 1589, [[Henry III of France|Henry III]], the last of the [[Valois Dynasty|Valois]] lineage, died at the walls of Paris. His successor, [[Henry IV of France|Henry IV of Navarre]], the first [[Bourbon Dynasty|Bourbon]] king of France, was a man of great ability, winning key victories against the [[Catholic League (French)|Catholic League]] at [[Battle of Arques|Arques]] (1589) and [[Battle of Ivry|Ivry]] (1590). Committed to stopping Henry of Navarre from becoming King of France, the Spanish divided their army in the Netherlands and invaded France, relieving [[Siege of Paris (1590)|Paris]] in 1590 and [[Siege of Rouen (1591)|Rouen]] in 1592.\n\nOn October 25, 1590 the Spanish landed in Nantes ([[Brittany]]). They established as an operational base the port of Blavet. On May 21, 1592 they defeated an Anglo-French army at the [[Battle of Craon]] and, after chasing the English contingent, they completely derailed it in [[Ambri\u00e8res]]. On 6 November of that year they took [[Brest, France|Brest]]. In 1593 the Spanish landed on [[Camaret-sur-Mer|Camaret]] and built \"La Pointe des Espagnols\" (The Tip of the Spaniards) fort in the Crozon peninsula, dominating the entrance to the Brest port. On October 1, an Anglo-French army started a [[Siege of Fort Crozon]], while an English fleet bombarded the place from the sea. The garrison could only hold out until November 15, while the auxiliary army, led by [[Juan del \u00c1guila]], failed to relieve the fort having been blocked at [[Plomodiern]]. On the 19th an assault by the besiegers put the garrison to the sword \u2014 there were only 13 survivors.\n\nThe Spanish decided to organize a punitive expedition against England for helping the French. Thus, on July 26, 1595, three companies of musketeers under the command of Captain [[Carlos de Am\u00e9squita]] sailed in four galleys. They first made landfall in [[Penmarch]] to get supplies. On July 31 they left for England and landed on August 2 in [[Mount's Bay|Mounts Bay]], [[Cornwall]]. In two days the [[Raid on Mount's Bay|expedition]] sacked and burned [[Mousehole]] (where only a pub survived), [[Newlyn]], Paul and [[Penzance]]. They also cleared the heavy artillery of the English and then re-embarked on the galleys. On 5 August, a day after setting sail back to France, they found a Dutch squadron of 46 ships from which they managed to escape but not before sinking two enemy ships. On August 10, Am\u00e9squita and his men landed victoriously in [[Blavet]]. The expedition resulted in 20 casualties, all of them in the skirmish against the Dutch.\n\nIn early June 1595, the Spanish [[List of governors of the Duchy of Milan|governor of Milan]], [[Juan Fern\u00e1ndez de Velasco, 5th Duke of Fr\u00edas|Juan Fern\u00e1ndez de Velasco]], crossed the Alps with an army of 12,000 troops from Italy and Sicily. The Catholic French noble [[Charles, Duke of Mayenne]] joined forces with him at Besan\u00e7on, and the combined Spanish-Catholic League army moved on with the goal of capturing Dijon. King Henry managed to gather 3,000 French troops, and he raced to Troyes to prevent the Spanish from doing so. At the [[Battle of Fontaine-Fran\u00e7aise]] on 5 June 1595, the French surprised the Spanish and forced them to retreat temporarily, and Velasco decided to retreat, thinking that the numerically-inferior French were waiting for reinforcements. The French royal victory there marked the end of the Catholic League. The French also made some progress during an invasion of the Spanish Netherlands, led by [[Henri de La Tour d'Auvergne, Duke of Bouillon]] and [[Fran\u00e7ois d'Orl\u00e9ans-Longueville, duc de Fronsac|Fran\u00e7ois d'Orl\u00e9ans-Longueville]]. The French captured [[Ham, Belgium|Ham]] and massacred the small Spanish garrison, provoking anger among the Spanish ranks. The new Spanish [[List of governors of the Habsburg Netherlands|governor of Flanders]], the [[Pedro Henriquez de Acevedo, Count of Fuentes|Count of Fuentes]], launched a concerted offensive that year, taking [[Siege of Doullens|Doullens]], Cambrai, and [[Siege of Le Catelet (1595)|Le Catelet]]; at Doullens, the Spanish shouted \"Remember Ham\" and massacred everyone in the city (military and civilians alike) in an act of revenge. On April 24, 1596, the Spanish also [[Siege of Calais (1596)|conquered Calais]]. Following the Spanish capture of Amiens in March 1597, King Henry IV laid siege to it until he managed to [[Siege of Amiens (1597)|reconquer Amiens]] from the overstretched Spanish forces in September 1597.\n\nIn 1595, [[Hugh O'Neill, Earl of Tyrone]] and [[Hugh Roe O'Donnell|Hugh O'Donnell]] had fitful Spanish backing when they led an [[Nine Years' War (Ireland)|Irish rebellion]]. In 1601, Spain landed soldiers on the coast of [[County Cork]] in support, but the groups did not rendezvous successfully. Instead, the Spanish were pinned down by the English at the [[Siege of Kinsale]], and they were decisively defeated in 1602.\n\nFaced with wars against France, England and the United Provinces, each led by capable leaders, the bankrupted Spanish empire found itself competing against strong adversaries. Continuing piracy against its shipping in the Atlantic and costly colonial enterprises forced Spain to renegotiate its debts in 1596. Philip had been forced to declare bankruptcy in 1557, 1560, 1575, and 1598.<ref>Burkholder, Suzanne Hiles, \"Philip II of Spain\" in {{harvnb|Encyclopedia of Latin American History and Culture|1996|loc=vol. 4, p. 393-394}}</ref> The crown attempted to reduce its exposure to the conflicts, first signing the [[Treaty of Vervins]] with France in 1598, recognizing [[Henry IV of France|Henry IV]] (since 1593 a Catholic) as king of France, and restoring many of the stipulations of the previous [[Peace of Cateau-Cambr\u00e9sis]].\n\n====The Indies====\n[[File:Capitulo-CIX.jpg|thumb|[[Cerro de Potos\u00ed|Potosi]], discovered in 1545, produced massive amounts of silver from a single site in upper Peru.

Although the Council of the Indies was tasked with oversight there, it acted without advice of high officials with direct colonial experience. Another serious problem was that the crown did not know what Spanish laws were in force there. To remedy the situation, Philip appointed Juan de Ovando, who was named President of the council, to give advice. Ovando appointed a \"chronicler and cosmographer of the Indies,\" [[:es:Juan L\u00f3pez de Velasco|Juan L\u00f3pez de Velasco]], to gather information about the crown's holdings, which resulted in the [[Relaciones geogr\u00e1ficas]] in the 1580s.{{sfn|Parker|1978|p=113}}\n\n[[File:TupacamaruI.JPG|thumb|left|upright|The last Inca leader, [[T\u00fapac Amaru]] was assassinated in 1572 at the order of the Viceroy [[Francisco de Toledo]].]]\n\nThe crown sought greater control over encomenderos, who had attempted to establish themselves as a local aristocracy; strengthened the power of the ecclesiastical hierarchy; shored up religious orthodoxy by the establishment of the Inquisition in Lima and Mexico City (1571); and increased revenues from silver mines in Peru and in Mexico, discovered in the 1540s. Particularly important was the crown's appointment of two able viceroys, Don [[Francisco de Toledo]] as viceroy of Peru (r. 1569-1581), and in Mexico, [[Mart\u00edn Enr\u00edquez de Almanza|Don Mart\u00edn Enr\u00edquez]] (r. 1568-1580), who was subsequently appointed viceroy to replace Toledo in Peru. In Peru, after decades of political unrest, with ineffective viceroys and encomenderos wielding undue power, weak royal institutions, a renegade Inca state existing in [[Vilcabamba, Peru|Vilcabamba]], and waning revenue from the silver mine of Potos\u00ed, Toledo's appointment was a major step forward for royal control. He built on reforms attempted under earlier viceroys, but he is often credited with a major transformation in crown rule in Peru. Toledo formalized the labor draft of Andean commoners, the [[Mit'a|mita]], to guarantee a labor supply for both the silver mine at [[Cerro Rico|Potos\u00ed]] and the mercury mine at [[Huancavelica]]. He established administrative districts of ''[[corregimiento]]'', and resettled native Andeans in [[reducciones]] to better rule them. Under Toledo, the last stronghold of the Inca state was destroyed and the last Inca emperor, [[Tupac Amaru I]], was executed. Silver from Potos\u00ed flowed to coffers in Spain and paid for Spain's wars in Europe.<ref>Bakewell, Peter, \"Francisco de Toledo\" in {{harvnb|Encyclopedia of Latin American History and Culture|1996|loc=vol. 5, p. 249}}</ref> In Mexico, Viceroy Enr\u00edquez organized the defense of the northern frontier against nomadic and bellicose indigenous groups, who attacked the transport lines of silver from the northern mines.{{sfn|Parker|1978|p=114}} In the religious sphere, the crown sought to bring the power of the religious orders under control with the ''Ordenanza del Patronazgo'', ordering friars to give up their Indian parishes and turn them over to the diocesan clergy, who were more closely controlled by the crown.\n\n[[File:Expedici\u00f3n de Drake y Hawkins 1595-1596.jpg|thumb|Expedition of Drake and Hawkins, 1595\u20131596]]\nThe crown expanded its global claims and defended existing ones in the Indies. Transpacific explorations had resulted in Spain claiming the Philippines and the establishment of Spanish settlements and trade with Mexico. The viceroyalty of Mexico was given jurisdiction over the Philippines, which became the entrep\u00f4t for Asian trade. Philip's succession to the crown of Portugal in 1580 complicated the situation on the ground in the Indies between Spanish and Portuguese settlers, although Brazil and Spanish America were administered through separate councils in Spain. Spain dealt with English encroachment on Spain's maritime control in the Indies, particularly by Sir [[Francis Drake]] and his cousin [[John Hawkins (naval commander)|John Hawkins]]. Drake narrowly escaped with his life when Hawkins' ships were trapped between Spanish galleons and shore batteries at [[Battle of San Juan de Ul\u00faa (1568)|San Juan de Ul\u00faa]] (in present-day Mexico). In January 1586, with [[Martin Frobisher]], Drake led a party ashore to sack [[Battle of Santo Domingo (1586)|Santo Domingo]] in Hispaniola, and he looted [[Battle of Cartagena de Indias (1586)|Cartagena de Indias]] several weeks later. The Spanish defeated the fleet of Drake and Hawkins in 1595 in [[Battle of San Juan (1595)|San Juan, Puerto Rico]] and Cartagena de Indias (Colombia). Spain regained control in the Isthmus of Panama by relocating the main port there from [[Nombre de Dios, Col\u00f3n|Nombre de Dios]] to [[Portobelo]].<ref>Pattridge, Blake D. \"Francis Drake\" in {{harvnb|Encyclopedia of Latin American History and Culture|1996|loc=vol. 2, p. 406}}</ref>\n\n====The Philippines, the Sultanate of Brunei and Southeast Asia====\n{{main|History of the Philippines (1521\u20131898)}}\n{{See also|Castilian War|Cambodian\u2013Spanish War|Spanish\u2013Moro conflict}}\n[[File:Manila Cathedral (1792) by Brambila.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|Manila Cathedral (1792)]]\n\nWith the conquest and settlement of the Philippines, the Spanish Empire reached its greatest extent.{{sfn|Kamen|2003|p=154}} In 1564, [[Miguel L\u00f3pez de Legazpi]] was commissioned by the [[viceroy of New Spain]] (Mexico), Don [[Luis de Velasco]], to lead an expedition in the Pacific Ocean to find the [[Maluku Islands|Spice Islands]], where earlier explorers [[Ferdinand Magellan]] and [[Ruy L\u00f3pez de Villalobos]] had landed in 1521 and 1543, respectively. The westward sailing to reach the sources of spices continued to be a necessity with the Ottomans still controlled major choke points in central Asia. It was unclear how the agreement between Spain and Portugal dividing the Atlantic world affected finds on the other side of the Pacific. Spain had ceded its rights to the \"Spice Islands\" to Portugal in the [[Treaty of Saragossa]] in 1529, but the appellation was vague as was their exact delineation. The Legazpi expedition was ordered by King Philip II, after whom the [[Philippines]] had earlier been named by Ruy L\u00f3pez de Villalobos, when Philip was heir to the throne. The king stated that \"the main purpose of this expediiton is to establish the return route from the western isles, since it is already known that the route to them is fairly short.\"<ref>quoted in {{harvnb|Kamen|2003|p= 201}}</ref> The viceroy died in July 1564, but the [[Audiencia Real|Audiencia]] and L\u00f3pez de Legazpi completed the preparations for the expedition. On embarking on the expedition, Spain lacked maps or information to guide the king's decision to authorize the expedition. That realization subsequently led to the creation of reports from the various regions of the empire, the [[relaciones geogr\u00e1ficas]].{{sfn|Kamen|2003|p=160}} The Philippines came under the jurisdiction of the viceroyalty of Mexico, and once the [[Manila Galleon]] sailings between Manila and Acapulco were established, Mexico became the Philippines' link to the larger Spanish Empire.\n\nSpanish colonization began in earnest when L\u00f3pez de Legazpi arrived from Mexico in 1565 and formed the first settlements in [[Cebu]]. Beginning with just five ships and five hundred men accompanied by Augustinian friars, and further strengthened in 1567 by two hundred soldiers, he was able to repel the Portuguese and create the foundations for the colonization of the archipelago. In 1571, the Spanish, their Mexican recruits and their Filipino (Visayan) allies attacked and occupied [[Kingdom of Maynila|Maynila]], a vassal-state of the [[Sultanate of Brunei]], and negotiated the incorporation of the [[Kingdom of Tondo]] which was liberated from the Bruneian Sultanate's control and of whom, their princess, Gandarapa, had a tragic romance with the Mexican-born Conquistador and grandson of Miguel Lopez de Legazpi, [[Juan de Salcedo]]. The combined Spanish-Mexican-Filipino forces also built a Christian walled city over the burnt ruins of Muslim Maynila and made it as the new capital of the [[Spanish East Indies]] and renamed it [[Manila]].{{sfnm|Kurlansky|1999|1p=64|Joaquin|1988}} Spaniards were few and life was difficult and they were often outnumbered by their Latino recruits and Filipino allies. They attempted to mobilize subordinated populations through the [[encomienda]]. Unlike in the Caribbean where the indigenous populations rapidly disappeared, the indigenous populations continued to be robust in the Philippines.{{sfn|Kamen|2003|p=203}} One Spaniard described the climate as \"cuarto meses de polvo, cuartro meses de lodo, y cuartro meses de todo\" (four months of dust, four months of mud, and four months of everything).<ref>quoted in {{cite book |first=Nicholas P. |last=Cushner |title=Spain in the Philippines |location=Quezon City |year=1971 |page=4 |publisher=Ateneo de Manila University}}</ref>\n\nLegazpi built a fort in Manila and made overtures of friendship to [[Lakan Dula]], Lakan of Tondo, who accepted. Maynila's former ruler, the Muslim rajah, [[Rajah Sulayman]], who was a vassal to the Sultan of Brunei, refused to submit to Legazpi but failed to get the support of Lakan Dula or of the Pampangan and Pangasinan settlements to the north. When [[Tarik Sulayman]] and a force of Kapampangan and Tagalog Muslim warriors attacked the Spaniards in the [[Battle of Bangkusay Channel|battle of Bangkusay]], he was finally defeated and killed. The Spanish also repelled an attack by Chinese pirate warlord [[Limahong]]. Simultaneously, the establishment of a Christianized Philippines attracted Chinese traders who exchanged their silk for Mexican silver, Indian and Malay traders also settled in the Philippines too, to trade their spices and gems for the same Mexican silver. The Philippines then became a center for Christian missionary activity that was also directed to Japan and the Philippines even accepted Christian converts from Japan after the Shogun persecuted them. Most of the soldiers and settlers sent by the Spanish to the Philippines were either from Mexico or Peru and very little people directly came from Spain.\n\nIn 1578, the [[Castilian War]] erupted between the Christian Spaniards and Muslim Bruneians over control of the Philippine archipelago.

They fought against the [[Sultanate of Brunei]] and its allies, the Bruneian puppet-states of Maynila and Sulu, which had dynastic links with Brunei. The Spanish, its Mexican recruits and Filipino allies assaulted Brunei and seized its capital, [[Kota Batu, Brunei-Muara|Kota Batu]].

Philip asserted his claim to the Portuguese throne and in June sent the Duke of Alba with an army to Lisbon to assure his succession. He established the [[Council of Portugal]], on the pattern of the [[Polysynodial System|royal councils]], the [[Council of Castile]], [[Council of Aragon]], and [[Council of the Indies]], that oversaw particular jurisdictions, but all under the same monarch. In Portugal, the Duke of Alba and the Spanish occupation were little more popular in [[Lisbon]] than in [[Rotterdam]]. The combined Spanish and Portuguese empires placed into Philip's hands included almost the entirety of the explored New World along with a vast trading empire in Africa and Asia. In 1582, when Philip II moved his court back to Madrid from the Atlantic port of Lisbon, where he had temporarily settled to pacify his new Portuguese kingdom, the pattern was sealed, in spite of what every observant commentator privately noted. \"Sea power is more important to the ruler of Spain than any other prince\", wrote one commentator, \"for it is only by sea power that a single community can be created out of so many so far apart.\" A writer on tactics in 1638 observed, \"The might most suited to the arms of Spain is that which is placed on the seas, but this matter of state is so well known that I should not discuss it, even if I thought it opportune to do so.\"<ref>Quoted in {{harvnb|Braudel|1984}}{{Specify|date=October 2008}}</ref> Portugal and her kingdoms, including Brazil and her African colonies, were under the dominion of the Spanish monarch.\n\n[[File:Expedici\u00f3n de Francis Drake 1585-1586.jpg|thumb|left|Sir Francis Drake's voyage, 1585\u201386]]\n\nPortugal required an extensive occupation force to keep it under control, and Spain was still reeling from the 1576 bankruptcy. In 1584, William the Silent was assassinated by a half-deranged Catholic, and the death of the popular Dutch resistance leader was hoped to bring an end to the war but did not. In 1585, Queen [[Elizabeth I of England]] sent support to the Protestant causes in the Netherlands and France, and [[Sir Francis Drake]] launched attacks against Spanish merchants in the Caribbean and the Pacific, along with a particularly aggressive attack on the port of [[Cadiz]].\n\nPortugal was brought into Spain's conflicts with rivals. In 1588, hoping to put a stop to Elizabeth's intervention, Philip sent the [[Spanish Armada]] to invade England. Unfavorable weather, plus heavily armed and man\u0153uvrable English ships, and the fact that the English had been warned by their spies in the Netherlands and were ready for the attack resulted in a defeat for the Armada. However, the failure of the [[English Armada|Drake\u2013Norris Expedition]] to Portugal and the Azores in 1589 marked a turning point in the on-off 1585\u20131604 [[Anglo-Spanish War (1585\u20131604)|Anglo\u2013Spanish War]]. The Spanish fleets became more effective in transporting greatly increased quantities of silver and gold from the Americas, while English attacks suffered costly failures.\n\nDuring the reign of Philip IV (Philip III of Portugal) in 1640, the Portuguese revolted and fought for their independence from the rest of Iberia.

In 1609, the great majority of the [[Morisco]] population of Spain (much more numerous and unassimilated in the kingdoms of [[Valencia]] and [[Aragon]], than in the [[Crown of Castile]] or the [[Principality of Catalonia]]) was expelled. It is estimated that [[Crown of Castile|Castile]] lost about 25% of its population between 1600 and 1623. Such a dramatic drop in the population meant the basis for the Crown's revenues was dangerously weakened in a time when it was engaged in continuous conflict in Europe.<ref>For a general account, see {{harvnb|Kennedy|2017|pp=40\u201393}}</ref>\n\nPeace with England and France gave Spain an opportunity to focus its energies on restoring its rule to the Dutch provinces. The Dutch, led by [[Maurice of Nassau]], the son of William the Silent and perhaps the greatest strategist of his time, had succeeded in taking a number of border cities since 1590, including the fortress of [[Breda (Netherlands)|Breda]]. However, the Genoese nobleman [[Ambrogio Spinola, 1st Marquess of Balbases|Ambrogio Spinola]], commanding an army of mercenary Italian troops, fought in the name of Spain and repeatedly defeated the Dutchmen. He was prevented from conquering the Netherlands only by Spain's latest [[Insolvency|bankruptcy]] in 1607. In 1609, the [[Twelve Years' Truce]] was signed between Spain and the [[Dutch Republic|United Provinces]]. At last, Spain was at peace \u2013 the ''{{lang|la|[[Pax Hispanica]]}}''.\n\nSpain made a fair recovery during the truce, putting its finances in order and doing much to restore its prestige and stability in the run-up to the last truly great war in which she would play a leading part. The Duke of Lerma (and to a large extent Philip II) had been uninterested in the affairs of their ally, Austria. In 1618, the king replaced him with Don [[Baltasar de Z\u00fa\u00f1iga]], a veteran ambassador to [[Vienna]]. Don Balthasar believed that the key to restraining the resurgent French and eliminating the Dutch was a closer alliance with [[Habsburg Monarchy]]. In 1618, beginning with the [[Defenestration of Prague]], Austria and the [[Holy Roman Emperor]], [[Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand II]], embarked on a campaign against the [[Protestant Union]] and [[Bohemia]]. Don Balthasar encouraged Philip to join the Austrian Habsburgs in the war, and Spinola, the rising star of the Spanish army in the Netherlands, was sent at the head of the [[Army of Flanders]] to intervene. Thus, Spain entered into the [[Thirty Years' War]].\n\n=== Philip IV (r. 1621-1665)===\n{{Main|Philip IV of Spain}}\n\nWhen Philip IV succeeded his father in 1621, Spain was clearly in economic and political decline, a source of consternation. The learned ''[[arbitrista]]s'' sent the king more analyses of Spain's problems and possible solutions. As an illustration of the precarious economic situation of Spain at the time, it was actually Dutch bankers who financed the [[East Indies|East India]] merchants of [[Seville]]. At the same time, everywhere in the world Dutch entrepreneurship and settlements were undermining Spanish and Portuguese [[hegemony]]. The Dutch were religiously tolerant and not evangelical, focusing on trade, as opposed to Spain's longstanding defense of Catholicism. A Dutch proverb says, \"Christ is good; trade is better!\"<ref name=\"non-spanish caribbean\" />\n\n[[File:Vel\u00e1zquez - de Breda o Las Lanzas (Museo del Prado, 1634-35).jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|The Surrender of [[Breda (Netherlands)|Breda]] (1625) to [[Ambrogio Spinola]], by [[Diego Vel\u00e1zquez|Vel\u00e1zquez]].

In 1622, Don Balthasar was replaced by [[Gaspar de Guzm\u00e1n, Count-Duke of Olivares]], a reasonably honest and able man.{{sfn|Elliott|1986}} After certain initial setbacks, the Bohemians were defeated at [[Battle of White Mountain|White Mountain]] in 1621, and again at [[Battle of Stadtlohn|Stadtlohn]] in 1623. The war with the Netherlands was renewed in 1621 with Spinola taking the fortress of [[Siege of Breda (1624)|Breda]] in 1625. The intervention of [[Christian IV of Denmark]] in the war threatened the Spanish position, but the victory of the Imperial general [[Albert of Wallenstein]] over the Danes at [[Battle of Dessau Bridge|Dessau Bridge]] and again at [[Battle of Lutter|Lutter]] (both in 1626), eliminated that threat.\n\nThere was hope in Madrid that the Netherlands might finally be reincorporated into the Empire, and after the defeat of Denmark the Protestants in Germany seemed crushed. France was once again involved in its own instabilities (the [[Siege of La Rochelle]] began in 1627), and Spain's eminence seemed clear. The Count-Duke Olivares asserted, \"God is Spanish and fights for our nation these days\".<ref>{{harvnb|Brown|Elliott|1980|p=190}}</ref>\n\nOlivares realized that Spain needed to reform, and to reform it needed peace, first and foremost with the Dutch United Provinces. Olivares aimed for \"peace with honor\", however, which meant in practice a peace settlement that would have restored to Spain something of its predominant position in the Netherlands. This was unacceptable to the United Provinces, and the inevitable consequence was the constant hope that one more victory would finally lead to \"peace with honor\", perpetuating the ruinous war that Olivares had wanted to avoid to begin with. In 1625, Olivares proposed the [[Union of Arms]], which aimed at raising revenues from the Indies and other kingdoms of Iberia for imperial defense, which met strong opposition.<ref>Andrien, Kenneth J. \"Uni\u00f3n de Armas\" in {{harvnb|Encyclopedia of Latin American History and Culture|1996|loc=vol. 5, p. 293}}</ref>{{sfn|Elliott|1986|pp=244-277}} The Union of Arms was the sparking point for a major revolt in Catalonia in 1640. This turmoil also seemed a propitious moment for the Portuguese to revolt against Habsburg rule, with the Duke of Braganza proclaimed as [[John IV of Portugal]].<ref>Burkholder, Suzanne Hiles. \"Philip IV of Spain\" in {{harvnb|Encyclopedia of Latin American History and Culture|1996|loc=vol. 4, p. 394}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Philip IV of Spain - Vel\u00e1zquez 1644.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Philip IV of Spain, Philip III of Portugal]]\n[[File:Vicente Carducho, Socorro de la plaza de Constanza..jpg|thumb|left|Victory of the Spanish troops led by the [[G\u00f3mez Su\u00e1rez de Figueroa, 3rd Duke of Feria|Duke of Feria]], at the city of [[Konstanz]], during the Thirty Years' War, 1633. Oil on canvas by Vicente Carducho, 1634.]]\n\nWhile Spinola and the Spanish army were focused on the Netherlands, the war seemed to go in Spain's favor. But in 1627 the Castilian economy collapsed. The Habsburg had been [[debasement|debasing]] their currency to pay for the war and [[inflation|prices exploded]], just as they had in previous years in Austria. Until 1631, parts of Castile operated on a [[barter]] economy owing to the currency crisis, and the government was unable to collect any meaningful taxes from the peasantry and had to depend on revenue from its colonies. The Spanish armies, like others in German territories, resorted to \"paying themselves\" on the land.\n\nOlivares had backed certain taxation reforms in Spain pending the end of the war, but was blamed for another embarrassing and fruitless [[War of the Mantuan Succession|war in Italy]]. The Dutch, who during the Twelve Years' Truce had made increasing their navy a priority, (which showed its maturing potency at the [[Battle of Gibraltar (1607)|Battle of Gibraltar]] 1607), managed to strike a great blow against Spanish maritime trade with the [[Battle in the Bay of Matanzas|capture]] by captain [[Piet Pieterszoon Hein|Piet Hein]] of the [[Spanish treasure fleet]] on which Spain had become dependent after the economic collapse.\n\nSpanish military resources were stretched across Europe and also at sea as they sought to protect maritime trade against the greatly improved Dutch and French fleets, while still occupied with the Ottoman and associated [[Barbary pirate]] threat in the Mediterranean. In the meantime the aim of choking Dutch shipping was carried out by the [[Dunkirkers]] with considerable success. In 1625 a Spanish-Portuguese fleet, under Admiral [[Fadrique de Toledo, 1st Marquis of Villanueva de Valdueza|Fadrique de Toledo]], regained the strategically vital Brazilian city of [[Salvador da Bahia]] from the Dutch. Elsewhere, the isolated and undermanned Portuguese forts in Africa and the Asia proved vulnerable to Dutch and English raids and takeovers or simply being bypassed as important trading posts.\n\nIn 1630, [[Gustavus Adolphus]] of Sweden, one of history's most noted commanders, landed in Germany and relieved the port of [[Stralsund]], the last continental stronghold of German forces belligerent to the Emperor. Gustavus then marched south and won notable victories at [[Battle of Breitenfeld (1631)|Breitenfeld]] and [[Battle of L\u00fctzen (1632)|L\u00fctzen]], attracting more Protestant support with every step he took. By now Spain was deeply involved in saving their Austrian allies from the Swedes who had continued to be wildly successful despite the death of Gustavus at L\u00fctzen in 1632. In early September 1634, a Spanish army that had marched from Italy linked with the Imperials at the town of [[N\u00f6rdlingen]], bringing their total to 33,000 troops. Having severely underestimated the number of experienced Spanish soldiers in the reinforcements, the commanders of the Protestant armies of the [[Heilbronn League]] decided to offer battle. The seasoned Spanish infantry \u2014 which had not been present at any of the battles that had ended in Swedish victories \u2014 was mostly responsible for the [[Battle of N\u00f6rdlingen (1634)|complete rout of the enemy army]], which lost 21,000 casualties out of 25,000 men (to only 3,500 for the Catholics).\n\n[[File:Westfaelischer Friede in Muenster (Gerard Terborch 1648).jpg|thumb|''The swearing of the oath of ratification of the Treaty of M\u00fcnster in 1648'' (1648) that ended the [[Eighty Years' War]] between Spain and the Netherlands. [[Gerard ter Borch]]]]\n\nAlarmed by the Spanish success at N\u00f6rdlingen and the probable collapse of the Swedish military effort [[Cardinal Richelieu]], the chief minister of [[Louis XIII]], realised that it would be necessary to turn the existing cold war into a hot one if Spain, in conjunction with the Austrian Habsburgs was to be stopped from dominating Europe.  The French won the [[Battle of Les Avins]] in Belgium on 20 May 1635, an early success, but the Spanish defeated a joint [[Siege of Leuven|Franco-Dutch invasion]] of the Spanish Netherlands before Spanish and Imperial armies cut through Picardy, Burgundy, and Champagne. However, the Spanish offensive stalled before Paris could be targeted, and the French launched counterattacks that drove the Spanish back into Flanders.\n\nAt the [[Battle of the Downs]] in 1639 a Spanish fleet carrying troops was destroyed off the English coast, and the Spanish found themselves unable to supply and reinforce their forces adequately in the Netherlands. The [[Army of Flanders]], which represented the finest of Spanish soldiery and leadership, faced a French assault led by [[Louis II de Bourbon, Prince de Cond\u00e9]] in northern France at [[Battle of Rocroi|Rocroi]] in 1643. The Spanish, led by [[Francisco de Melo]], were beaten by the French. After a closely fought battle the Spanish were forced to surrender on honorable terms. As a result, while the defeat was not a rout, the high status of the Army of Flanders was ended at Rocroi. The defeat at Rocroi also led to the dismissal of the embattled Olivares, who was confined to his estates by the king's order and died two years later. The [[Peace of Westphalia]] ended the Spanish [[Eighty Years' War]] in 1648, with Spain recognizing the independence of the Seven United Provinces of the Netherlands.\n\nIn 1640, Spain had already experienced the loss of Portugal, following its revolt against Spanish rule, and brought to an end the Iberian Union, and the establishment of the [[House of Braganza]]under king [[John IV of Portugal]]. He had received widespread support from the Portuguese people, and Spain was unable to respond, since it was at war with France and Catalonia revolted that year. with the war against France. Spain and Portugal co-existed in a ''de facto'' state of peace from 1644 to 1656. When John died in 1656, the Spanish attempted to wrest Portugal from his son [[Alfonso VI of Portugal]] but were defeated at [[Battle of Ameixial|Ameixial]] (1663) and [[Battle of Montes Claros|Montes Claros]] (1665), leading to Spain's recognition of Portugal's independence in 1668, during the regency of Philip IV's young heir, Charles II, who was seven at the time.\n\n[[File:Traite-Pyrenees.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|The meeting of [[Philip IV of Spain]] and [[Louis XIV]] of France on 7 July 1660 at [[Pheasant Island]]]]\n\n[[Franco-Spanish War (1635\u201359)|War with France]] continued for eleven more years. Although France suffered from a civil war from 1648 to 1652 (''see [[Fronde|Wars of the Fronde]]''), Spain had been exhausted by the Thirty Years' War and the ongoing revolts. With the war against the United Provinces at an end in 1648, the Spanish drove the French out of Naples and Catalonia in 1652, recaptured Dunkirk, and occupied several northern French forts that they held until peace was made. The war came to an end soon after the [[Battle of the Dunes (1658)]], where the French army under [[Henri de la Tour d'Auvergne, Vicomte de Turenne|Viscount Turenne]] retook Dunkirk. Spain agreed to the [[Peace of the Pyrenees]] in 1659 that ceded to France the Spanish Netherlands territory of [[Artois]] and the northern Catalan county of [[Roussillon]].

Under the regency, [[Louis XIV of France]] prosecuted the [[War of Devolution]] against the [[Spanish Netherlands]] in 1667\u201368, losing considerable prestige and territory, including the cities of [[Lille]] and [[Charleroi]]. In the [[Franco-Dutch War]] of 1672\u20131678, Spain lost still more territory when it came to the assistance of its former Dutch enemies, most notably [[Franche-Comt\u00e9]].\n\nIn the [[Nine Years' War]] (1688\u20131697) Louis XIV once again invaded the Spanish Netherlands. French forces led by the [[Fran\u00e7ois Henri de Montmorency-Bouteville, duc de Luxembourg|Duke of Luxembourg]] defeated the Spanish at [[Battle of Fleurus (1690)|Fleurus]] (1690) and subsequently defeated Dutch forces under [[William III of England|William III of Orange]], who fought on Spain's side. The war ended with most of the Spanish Netherlands under French occupation, including the important cities of [[Ghent]] and [[Luxembourg]]. The war revealed to Europe the vulnerability of the Spanish defenses and bureaucracy. Further, the ineffective Spanish Habsburg government took no action to improve them.\n\nSpain suffered utter decay and stagnation during the final decades of the seventeenth century. While the rest of Western Europe went through exciting changes in government and society \u2013 the [[Glorious Revolution]] in England and the reign of the [[Louis XIV of France|Sun King]] in France \u2013 Spain remained adrift. The Spanish bureaucracy that had built up around the charismatic, industrious, and intelligent [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles I]] and [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]] demanded a strong and hardworking monarch; the weakness and lack of interest of [[Philip III of Spain|Philip III]] and [[Philip IV of Spain|Philip IV]] contributed to Spain's decay. [[Charles II of Spain|Charles II]] was childless and weak ruler, known as \"The Bewitched.\" In his last will and testament he left his throne to a French prince, the [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon]] [[Philip V of Spain|Philip of Anjou]], rather than to another Habsburg. This resulted in the [[War of the Spanish Succession]], with the Austrian Habsburg and the British challenging Charles II's choice of a Bourbon prince to succeed him as king.\n\n== Spanish America ==\n{{Main|Spanish colonization of the Americas}}\n{{see|Criollo people#Spanish colonial caste system{{!}}Society of the Spanish-Americans in the Spanish Colonial Americas}}\nTo the end of its imperial rule, Spain called its overseas possessions in the Americas and the Philippines \"The Indies,\" an enduring remnant of Columbus's notion that he had reached Asia by sailing west. When these territories reach a high level of importance, the crown established the [[Council of the Indies]] in 1524, following the [[Spanish conquest of the Aztec empire|conquest of the Aztec empire]], asserting permanent royal control over its possessions. Regions with dense indigenous populations and sources of mineral wealth attracting Spanish settlers became colonial centers, while those without such resources were peripheral to crown interest.

The Spanish forces, in addition to significant armament and equestrian advantages, exploited the rivalries between competing [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous peoples]], tribes, and nations, some of which were willing to form alliances with the Spanish in order to defeat their more-powerful enemies, such as the [[Aztec Empire|Aztecs]] or [[Inca Empire|Incas]]\u2014a [[divide and rule|tactic]] that would be extensively used by later European colonial powers. The Spanish conquest was also facilitated by the spread of diseases (e.g. [[smallpox]]), common in Europe but never present in the New World, which reduced the [[Population history of indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous populations in the Americas]]. This sometimes caused a labor shortage for plantations and public works and so the colonists informally and gradually, at first, initiated the [[Atlantic slave trade]].

The [[Basques|Basque]] commander [[Juan Sebasti\u00e1n Elcano]] led the expedition to success. Spain sought to enforce their rights in the [[Maluku Islands|Moluccan islands]], which led a conflict with the Portuguese, but the issue was resolved with the [[Treaty of Zaragoza]] (1525), settling the location of the [[antimeridian]] of Tordesillas, which would divide the world into two equal [[Sphere|hemispheres]]. From then on, maritime expeditions led to the discovery of several archipelagos in the South Pacific as the [[Pitcairn Islands]], the [[Marquesas Islands|Marquesas]], [[Tuvalu]], [[Vanuatu]], the [[Solomon Islands]] or [[New Guinea]], to which Spain laid claim.\n\nMost important in Pacific exploration was the claim on the [[Philippines]], which was populous and strategically located for the Spanish settlement of Manila and entrep\u00f4t for trade with China. On 27 April 1565, the first permanent Spanish settlement in the [[Philippines]] was founded by [[Miguel L\u00f3pez de Legazpi]] and the service of [[Manila Galleon]]s was inaugurated. The Manila Galleons shipped goods from all over Asia across the Pacific to [[Acapulco]] on the coast of Mexico. From there, the goods were transshipped across Mexico to the [[Spanish treasure fleet]]s, for shipment to Spain. The Spanish trading port of [[Manila]] facilitated this trade in 1572. Although Spain claimed islands in the Pacific, it did not encounter or claim the Hawaiian Islands.

The Catholicism remains the dominant religion in Spanish America. The crown also imposed restrictions on emigration to the Americas, excluding Jews and [[crypto-Jews]], Protestants, and foreigners, using the ''Casa de Contrataci\u00f3n'' to vet potential emigres and issue licenses to travel.\n\nThe portrait to the right was most likely used as a souvenir. For those who traveled to the New World and back it was common to bring back souvenirs as there were a great interest in what the New World meant. The land would be significantly different but there was a special emphasis put on the emerging mixed races. Not only was there whites mixing with blacks but there were natives mixing with both whites and blacks as well. From a Spanish viewpoint, the castas paintings would most-likely have provided a sort of sense to the madness that was mixed races. There were political implications of this portrait as well.

Once those issues were resolved theologically, in practice the crown sought to protect its new vassals. It did so by dividing peoples of the Americas into the ''Rep\u00fablica de Indios'', the native populations, and the ''Rep\u00fablica de Espa\u00f1oles''. The Rep\u00fablica de Espa\u00f1oles was the entire Hispanic sector, composed of Spaniards, but also Africans (enslaved and free), as well as mixed-race [[casta]]s.\n\nWithin the ''Rep\u00fablica de Indios'', men were explicitly excluded from ordination to the Catholic priesthood and obligation for military service as well as the jurisdiction of the Inquisition. Indians under colonial rule who lived in pueblos de indios had crown protections due to their statuses as legal minors. Due to the lack of prior exposure to the Catholic faith, Queen Isabella had declared all indigenous peoples her subjects. This differed from people of the African continent because these populations had theoretically been exposed to Catholicism and chose not to follow it. This religious differentiation is important because it gave indigenous communities legal protections from members of the R\u00e9publica de Espa\u00f1oles. In fact, an often overlooked aspect of the colonial legal system was that members of the pueblos de indios could appeal to the crown and circumvent the legal system in the R\u00e9publica de Espa\u00f1oles. The statuses of the indigenous populations as legal minors barred them from becoming priests, but the r\u00e9publica de indios operated with a fair amount of autonomy. Missionaries also acted as guardians against ''encomendero'' exploitation. Indian communities had protections of traditional lands by the creation of community lands that could not be alienated, the ''fondo legal''. They managed their own affairs internally through Indian town government under the supervision of royal officials, the ''corregidores'' and ''alcaldes mayores''. Although indigenous men were barred from becoming priests, indigenous communities created religious [[confraternity|confraternaties]] under priestly supervision, which functioned as burial societies for their individual members, but also organized community celebrations for their patron saint. Blacks also had separate confraternities, which likewise contributed to community formation and cohesion, reinforcing identity within a Christian institution.<ref>{{cite book |last=von Germeten |first=Nicole |title=Black Blood Brothers: Confraternities and Social Mobility for Afro-Mexicans |location=Gainesville, FL |publisher=University of Florida Press |date=2006}}</ref>\n\nConquest and evangelization were inseparable in Spanish America. The first order to make the trip to the Americas were the Franciscans, led by Pedro de Gante. Franciscans believed that living a spiritual life of poverty and holiness was the best way to be an example that inspired others to convert. The friars would walk into the towns barefoot as a display of their surrender to God in a sort of theater of conversion.  With this began the practice of evangelization of the peoples of the new world as supported by the Spanish government. \nReligious orders in Spanish America had their own internal structures and were organizationally autonomous, but nonetheless were very important to the structure of colonial society. They had their own resources and hierarchies. Though some orders took vows of poverty, by the time the second wave of friars came to the Americas and as their numbers grew, the orders began amassing wealth and thus became key economic players. The church, as this wealthy power, had huge estates and built large constructions such as gilded monasteries and cathedrals. Priests themselves also became wealthy landowners. Orders like the Franciscans also established schools for the indigenous elites as well as hired indigenous laborers, thereby shifting the dynamics in the indigenous communities and their relationship to the Spanish.\n\n[[File:Emperadores del Peru Parte2 - AHG.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Detail of a gallery of portraits of sovereigns in Peru, showing continuity from Inca emperors to Spanish monarchs.

The crown recognized noble status of elite Indians, giving them exemption from the head-tax and the right to use the nobles title ''don'' and ''do\u00f1a''. Indigenous noblemen were a key group for the administration of the Spanish Empire, since they served as intermediaries between crown officials and indigenous communities.{{sfn|Gibson|1964}}<ref>{{cite journal |last=Rowe |first=John H. |title=The Incas Under Spanish Colonial Institutions |journal=[[Hispanic American Historical Review]] |volume=37 |number=2 |date=May 1957 |pages=155\u2013159|doi=10.2307/2510330 |jstor=2510330 |url=http://www.escholarship.org/uc/item/7mm4g75z }}\n\n*{{cite book |last=Fern\u00e1ndez de Recas |first=Guillermo S. |title=Cacicazgos y nobiliario ind\u00edgena de la Nueva Espa\u00f1a |location=M\u00e9xico |publisher=Instituto Bibliogr\u00e1fico Mexicano |date=1961}}</ref> Indigenous noblemen could serve on ''cabildos'', ride horses, and carry firearms. The crown's recognition of indigenous elites as nobles meant that these men were incorporated into colonial system with privileges separating them from Indian commoners. Indian noblemen were thus crucial to the governance of the huge indigenous population. Through their continued loyalty to the crown, they maintained their positions of power within their communities but also served as agents of colonial governance. The Spanish Empire's utilization of local elites to rule large populations that are ethnically distinct from the rulers has long been practiced by earlier empires.{{sfn|Burbank|Cooper|2010|p= 8}} Indian [[cacique]]s were crucial in the early Spanish period, especially when the economy was still based on extracting tribute and labor from commoner Indians who had rendered goods and service to their overlords in the prehispanic period. Caciques mobilized their populations for encomenderos and, later, ''repartimiento'' recipients chosen by the crown. The noblemen became the officers of the cabildo in indigenous communities, regulating internal affairs, as well as defending the communities\u2019 rights in court. In Mexico, this was facilitated by the 1599 establishment of the [[General Indian Court (Mexico)|General Indian Court]] (''Juzgado General de Indios''), which heard legal disputes in which indigenous communities and individuals were engaged. With legal mechanisms for dispute-resolution, there were relatively few outbreaks of violence and rebellion against crown rule. Eighteenth-century rebellions in long-peaceful areas of Mexico, the [[Tzeltal Rebellion of 1712]] and most spectacularly in Peru with the [[Rebellion of T\u00fapac Amaru II|Tupac Amaru Rebellion]] (1780\u201381) saw indigenous noblemen leading uprisings against the Spanish state.\n\nIn the ''Rep\u00fablica de Espa\u00f1oles'', class and race hierarchies were codified in institutional structures. Spaniards emigrating to The Indies were to be Old Christians of [[limpieza de sangre|pure Christian heritage]], with the crown excluding [[New Christians]], converts from Judaism and their descendants, because of their suspect religious status. The crown established the Inquisition in Mexico and Peru in 1571, and later Cartagena de Indias (Colombia), to guard Catholics from the influence of [[crypto-Jews]], Protestants, and foreigners. Church practices established and maintained racial hierarchies by recording baptism, marriage, and burial were kept separate registers for different racial groups. Churches were also physically divided by race.<ref>{{cite book |last=O\u2019Hara |first=Matthew |title=A Flock Divided: Race, Religion, and Politics in Mexico, 1749-1857 |location=Durham |publisher=Duke University Press |date=2009}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Madrid School - Auto-da-fe - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|''Auto de Fe'' in Toledo, Spain 1651.

There was a pyramid of racial status with the apex being the small number of European white (''espa\u00f1oles''), a slightly larger number of mixed-race castas, who, like the whites were mainly urban dwelling, and the largest populations were Indians living in communities in the countryside. Although Indians were classified as part of the ''Rep\u00fabica de Indios'', their offspring of unions with ''Espa\u00f1oles'' and Africans were ''castas''. White-Indian mixtures were more socially acceptable in the Hispanic sphere, with the possibility over generations of mixed-race offspring being classified as Espa\u00f1ol. Any offspring with African ancestry could never remove the \"stain\" of their racial heritage, since Africans were seen as \"natural slaves.\" Eighteenth-century paintings depicted elites' ideas of the [[casta|''sistema de castas'']] in hierarchical order,<ref>{{cite book |last=Katzew |first=Ilona |title=Casta Painting |location=New Haven |publisher=Yale University Press |date=2004}}</ref> but there was some fluidity in the system rather than absolute rigidity.<ref>{{cite book |last=Cope |first=R.

Non-whites (blacks and mixed-race castas) were far more often and more severely punished, while Indians, considered legal minors, were not expected to behave better and were more leniently punished. Royal and municipal legislation attempted to control the behavior of black slaves, who were subject to a curfew, could not carry arms, and were prohibited from running away from their masters. As the urban, white, lower-class (plebeian) population increased, they too were increasingly subject to criminal arrest and punishment. Capital punishment was seldom employed, with the exception of sodomy and recalcitrant prisoners of the Inquisition, whose deviation from Christian orthodoxy was considered extreme. However, only the civil sphere could exercise capital punishment and prisoners were \u201crelaxed,\u201d that is, released to civil authorities. Often criminals served sentences of hard labor in textile workshops (''obrajes''), presidio service on the frontier, and as sailors on royal ships. Royal pardons to ordinary criminals were often accorded on the celebration of a royal marriage, coronation, or birth.<ref>Burkholder, Mark A. \"Criminal Justice\" in {{harvnb|Encyclopedia of Latin American History and Culture|1996|loc=vol. 2, p. 298-300}}\n\n*{{cite book |last=MacLachlan |first=Colin M. |title=Criminal Justice in Eighteenth-Century Mexico: A Study of the Acordada |location=Berkeley |publisher=University of California Press |year=1975}}</ref>\n\nElite Spanish men had access to special corporate protections (''[[fuero]]s'') and had exemptions by virtue of their membership in a particular group. One important privilege was their being judged by the court of their corporation. Members of the clergy held the ''fuero eclesi\u00e1stico'' were judged by ecclesiastical courts, whether the offense was civil or criminal. In the eighteenth century the crown established a standing military and with it, special privileges (''fuero militar''). The privilege extended to the military was the first ''fuero'' extended to the non-whites who served the crown. Indians had a form of corporate privilege through their membership in indigenous communities. In central Mexico, the crown established a special Indian court (Juzgado General de Indios), and legal fees, including access to lawyers, were funded by a special tax.<ref>{{cite book |last=Borah |first=Woodrow |title=Justice by Insurance |location=Berkeley |publisher=University of California Press |year=1983}}</ref> The crown extended the peninsular institution of the merchant guild (''[[consulado]]'') first established in Spain, including Seville (1543), and later established in Mexico City and Peru. Consulado membership was dominated by peninsular-born Spaniards, usually members of transatlantic commercial houses. The consulados\u2019 tribunals heard disputes over contracts, bankruptcy, shipping, insurance and the like and became a wealthy and powerful economic institution and source of loans to the viceroyalties.<ref>Woodward, Ralph Lee. \u201cConsulado\u201d in {{harvnb|Encyclopedia of Latin American History and Culture|1996|loc=vol. 2, p. 254-256}}</ref> Transatlantic trade remained in the hands of mercantile families based in Spain and the Indies. The men in the Indies were often younger relatives of the merchants in Spain, who often married wealthy American-born women. American-born Spanish men (''criollos'') in general did not pursue commerce but instead owned landed estates, entered the priesthood, or became a professional. Within elite families then peninsular-born Spaniards and ''criollos'' were often kin.{{sfn|Lockhart|Schwartz|1983|p= 324-325}}\n\nThe regulation of the social system perpetuated the privileged status of wealthy elite white men against the vast indigenous populations, and the smaller but still significant number of mixed-race castas. In the Bourbon era, for the first time there was a distinction made between Iberian-born and American-born Spaniards, In the Habsburg era, in law and ordinary speech they were grouped together without distinction. Increasingly American-born Spaniards developed a distinctly local focus, with peninsular-born (''peninsulares'') Spaniards increasingly seen as outsiders and resented, but this was a development in the late colonial period. Resentment against ''peninsulares'' was due to a deliberate change in crown policy, which systematically favored them over American-born ''criollos'' for high positions in the civil and religious hierarchies.{{sfn|Lockhart|Schwartz|1983|p=320}} This left ''criollos'' only the membership in a city or town's cabildo. When the secularizing Bourbon monarchy pursued policies strengthening secular royal power over religious power, it attacked the ''fuero eclesi\u00e1stico'', which for many members of the lower clergy was a significant privilege. Parish priests who had functioned as royal officials as well as clerics in Indian towns lost their privileged position.

While the Habsburgs were committed to maintaining a state monopoly in theory, in reality the Empire was a porous economic realm and smuggling was widespread. In the 16th and 17th century under the Habsburgs, Spain experienced a gradual decline in economic conditions, especially relative to the industrial development of its French, Dutch, and English rivals. Many of the goods being exported to the Empire originated from manufacturers in northwest Europe, rather than in Spain. But illicit commercial activities became a part of the Empire's administrative structure. Supported by large flows of silver from America, trade prohibited by Spanish mercantilist trade restrictions flourished, because it provided a source of income to both crown officials and private merchants.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Silver, trade, and war : spain and america in the making of early modern europe.|last=Stein, Stanley J.|date=2003|publisher=Johns Hopkins Univ Press|isbn=0-8018-7755-5|oclc=173164546}}</ref> The local administrative structure in Buenos Aires, for example, was established through its oversight of both legal and illegal commerce.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Moutoukias|first=Zacarias|date=1988|title=Power, Corruption, and Commerce: The Making of the Local Administrative Structure in Seventeenth-Century Buenos Aires|journal=The Hispanic American Historical Review|volume=68|issue=4|pages=771\u2013801|doi=10.2307/2515681|issn=0018-2168|jstor=2515681}}</ref> In the eighteenth century the crown attempted to reverse course under the Bourbon monarchs. The crown's pursuit of wars to maintain and expand territory, defend the Catholic faith and stamp out Protestantism, and beat back Ottoman Turkish strength outstripped its ability to pay for it all, despite the huge production of silver in Peru and Mexico. Most of that flow paid mercenary soldiers in the European religious wars in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries and into foreign merchants\u2019 hands to pay for the consumer goods manufactured in northern Europe. Paradoxically the wealth of the Indies impoverished Spain and enriched northern Europe. In the eighteenth century the crown attempted to reverse course under the Bourbon monarchs.{{sfn|Stein|Stein|2000|p= 40-57}}\n\nThis was well recognized in Spain, with writers on political economy, the ''[[arbitristas]]'' sending the crown lengthy analyses in the form of \"memorials, of the perceived problems and with proposed solutions.<ref>Andrien, Kenneth A. \u201cArbitristas\u201d in {{harvnb|Encyclopedia of Latin American History and Culture|1996|loc=vol. 1 p. 122}}</ref>{{sfn|Stein|Stein|2000|p=94-102}} According to these thinkers, \"Royal expenditure must be regulated, the sale of office halted, the growth of the church checked. The tax system must be overhauled, special concessions be made to agricultural laborers, rivers be made navigable and dry lands irrigated. In this way alone could Castile's productivity increased, its commerce restored, and its humiliating dependence on foreigners, on the Dutch and the Genoese, be brought to an end.\"{{sfn|Elliott|1989|p=231}}\n\nFrom the early days of the Caribbean and conquest era, the crown attempted to control trade between Spain and the Indies with restrictive policies enforced by the House of Trade (est. 1503) in Seville. Shipping was through particular ports in Spain (Seville, subsequently Cadiz), Spanish America (Veracruz, Acapulco, Havana, Cartagena de Indias, and Callao/Lima) and the Philippines (Manila). Spanish settlers in the Indies in the very early period were few and Spain could supply sufficient goods to them. But as the Aztec and Inca empires were conquered in the early sixteenth century and then large deposits of silver found in both Mexico and Peru, the regions of those major empires, Spanish immigration increased and demand for goods rose far beyond Spain's ability to supply it. Since Spain had little capital to invest in the expanding trade and no significant commercial group, bankers and commercial houses in Genoa, Germany, The Netherlands, France, and England supplied both investment capital and goods in a supposedly closed system. Even in the sixteenth century, Spain recognized that the idealized closed system did not function in reality. Despite that the crown did not alter its restrictive structure or advocacy of fiscal prudence, despite the pleas of the ''[[arbitrista]]s'', the Indies trade remained nominally in the hands of Spain, but in fact enriched the other European countries.\n[[File:Spanish Galleon.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Spanish galleon]], the mainstay of transatlantic and transpacific shipping, engraving by [[Albert Durer]]]] \nThe crown established the system of [[Spanish treasure fleets|treasure fleets]] ({{lang-es|flota}}) to protect the conveyance of silver to Seville (later Cadiz). Merchants in Seville conveyed consumer goods that were registered and taxed by the House of Trade. were sent to the Indies were produced in other European countries. Other European commercial interests came to dominate supply, with Spanish merchant houses and their guilds (''[[consulado]]s'') in Spain and the Indies acting as mere middlemen, reaping profits a slice of the profits. However, those profits did not promote Spanish economic development of a manufacturing sector, with its economy continuing to be based on agriculture. The wealth of the Indies led to prosperity in northern Europe, particularly The Netherlands and England, both Protestant. As Spain's power weakened in the seventeenth century, England, The Netherlands, and the French took advantage overseas by seizing islands in the Caribbean, which became bases for a burgeoning contraband trade in Spanish America. Crown officials who were supposed to suppress contraband trade were quite often in cahoots with the foreigners, since it was a source of personal enrichment. In Spain, the crown itself participated in collusion with foreign merchant houses, since they paid fines, \"meant to establish a compensation to the state for losses through fraud.\" it became for merchant houses a calculated risk for doing business; for the crown it gained income it would have lost otherwise. Foreigner merchants were part of the supposed monopoly system of trade. The transfer of the House of Trade from Seville to Cadiz meant even easier access of foreign merchant houses to the Spanish trade.{{sfn|Lynch|1989|pages=10\u201311}}\n\nThe motor of the Spanish imperial economy that had a global impact was [[silver mining]]. The mines in Peru and Mexico were in the hands of a few elite mining entrepreneurs, with access to capital and a stomach for the risk mining entailed. They operated under a system of royal licensing, since the crown held the rights to subsoil wealth. Mining entrepreneurs assumed all the risk of the enterprise, while the crown gained a 20% slice of the profits, the [[royal fifth]] (\u201cQuinto\u201d). Further adding to the crown's revenues was mining was that it crown held a monopoly on the supply of mercury, used for separating pure silver from silver ore in the [[patio process]]. The crown kept the price high, thereby depressing the volume of silver production.<ref name=\"Miningcolonies\">Bakewell, Peter and Kendall W.

This was a rotational forced labor system where indigenous pueblos were obligated to send laborers to work in Spanish mines and plantations for a set number of days out of the year. Repartimiento was not implemented to replace slave labor but instead existed alongside free wage labor, slavery, and indentured labor. It was, however, a way for the Spanish to procure cheap labor thus boosting the mining-driven economy. It is important to note that the men who worked as repartimiento laborers were not always resistant to the practice. Some were drawn to the labor as a way to supplement the wages they earned cultivating fields so as to support their families and, of course, pay tributes. At first, a Spaniard could get repartimiento laborers to work for them with permission from a crown official, such as a viceroy,  only on the basis that this labor was absolutely necessary to provide the country with important resources. This condition became laxer as the years went on and various enterprises had repartimiento laborers where they would work in dangerous conditions for long hours and low wages. <ref>{{cite book |last1=Tutino |first1=John |title=In The Mexican Heartland: How Communities Shaped Capitalism, a Nation, and World History, 1500-2000 |date=2018 |publisher=Princeton University Press |pages=57\u201390}}</ref>\n\n[[File:1713 Asiento contract.png|thumb|upright|Cover of the English translation of the Asiento contract signed by Britain and Spain in 1713 as part of the Utrecht treaty that ended the War of Spanish Succession.

It attempted to restructure to establish as closed trading system, but it was hampered by the terms of the 1713 Treaty of Utrecht. The treaty ending the War of the Spanish Succession with a victory for the Bourbon French candidate for the throne had a provision for the British to legally trade by a license (''[[asiento]]'') African slaves to Spanish America. The provision undermined the possibility of a revamped Spanish monopoly system. The merchants also used the opportunity to engage in contraband trade of their manufactured goods. Crown policy sought to make legal trade more appealing than contraband by instituting free commerce (''comercio libre'') in 1778 whereby Spanish American ports could trade with each other and they could trade with any port in Spain. It was aimed at revamping a closed Spanish system and outflanking the increasingly powerful British empire. Silver production revived in the eighteenth century, with production far surpassing the earlier output. The crown reducing the taxes on mercury, meaning that a greater volume of pure silver could be refined. Silver mining absorbed most available capital in Mexico and Peru, and the crown emphasized the production of precious metals that was sent to Spain.

(This growth was slower than the growth of illicit trade by northern rivals in the empire's markets.) However, this recovery was not then translated into institutional improvement, rather the \"proximate solutions to permanent problems.\"{{sfn|Lynch|1989|p= 1}} This legacy of neglect was reflected in the early years of Bourbon rule in which the military was ill-advisedly pitched into battle in the [[War of the Quadruple Alliance]] (1718\u20131720). Following the war, the new Bourbon monarchy took a much more cautious approach to international relations, relying on a family alliance with Bourbon France, and continuing to follow a program of institutional renewal.\n\nThe crown program to enact reforms that promoted administrative control and efficiency in the metropole to the detriment of interests in the colonies undermined creole elites' loyalty to the crown. When French forces of [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] invaded the Iberian peninsula in 1808, Napoleon ousted the Spanish Bourbon monarchy, placing his brother [[Joseph Bonaparte]] on the Spanish throne.

The contraband trade that was the lifeblood of the Habsburg empire declined in proportion to registered shipping (a shipping registry having been established in 1735).\n\nTwo upheavals registered unease within Spanish America and at the same time demonstrated the renewed resiliency of the reformed system: the [[T\u00fapac Amaru II|Tupac Amaru uprising]] in Peru in 1780 and the [[Revolt of the Comuneros (New Granada)|rebellion of the ''comuneros'']] of [[Viceroyalty of New Granada|New Granada]], both in part reactions to tighter, more efficient control.\n\n=== 18th-century prosperity ===\n[[File:FORTRESS OF SAN FELIPE CARTAGENA.JPG|thumb|San Felipe de Barajas Fortress [[Cartagena de Indias]].

Shipping grew rapidly from the mid-1740s until the [[Seven Years' War]] (1756\u20131763), reflecting in part the success of the Bourbons in bringing illicit trade under control. With the loosening of trade controls after the Seven Years' War, shipping trade within the empire once again began to expand, reaching an extraordinary rate of growth in the 1780s.\n\nThe end of Cadiz's monopoly of trade with America brought about a rebirth of Spanish manufactures. Most notable was the rapidly growing textile industry of [[Catalonia]] which by the mid-1780s saw the first signs of industrialization. This saw the emergence of a small, politically active commercial class in [[Barcelona]]. This isolated pocket of advanced economic development stood in stark contrast to the relative backwardness of most of the country. Most of the improvements were in and around some major coastal cities and the major islands such as [[Cuba]], with its tobacco [[plantation]]s, and a renewed growth of [[precious metal]]s mining in America.\n\nOn the other hand, most of rural Spain and its empire, where the great bulk of the population lived, lived in relatively backward conditions by 18th-century West European standards, reinforced old customs and isolation. Agricultural productivity remained low despite efforts to introduce new techniques to what was for the most part an uninterested, exploited peasant and labouring groups. Governments were inconsistent in their policies. Though there were substantial improvements by the late 18th century, Spain was still an economic backwater. Under the [[mercantilism|mercantile]] trading arrangements it had difficulty in providing the goods being demanded by the strongly growing markets of its empire, and providing adequate outlets for the return trade.\n\nFrom an opposing point of view according to the \"backwardness\" mentioned above the naturalist and explorer [[Alexander von Humboldt]] traveled extensively throughout the Spanish Americas, exploring and describing it for the first time from a modern scientific point of view between 1799 and 1804. In his work ''Political essay on the kingdom of New Spain containing researches relative to the geography of Mexico'' he says that the Indians of [[Viceroyalty of New Spain|New Spain]] lived in better conditions than any Russian or German peasant in Europe.{{sfn|von Humboldt|1811}} According to Humboldt, despite the fact that Indian farmers were poor, under Spanish rule they were free and slavery was non-existent, their conditions were much better than any other peasant or farmer in the advanced Northern Europe.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Janota |first1=Tom |title=Alexander von Humboldt, un explorador cient\u00edfico en Am\u00e9rica |publisher=CIDCLI |isbn=9786078351121 |pages=64 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=jmuVBgAAQBAJ |language=en |date=2015-02-09}}</ref>\n\nHumboldt also published a comparative analysis of bread and meat consumption in New Spain (M\u00e9xico) compared to other cities in Europe such as Paris. Mexico City consumed 189 pounds of meat per person per year, in comparison to 163 pounds consumed by the inhabitants of Paris, the Mexicans also consumed almost the same amount of bread as any European city, with 363 kilograms of bread per person per year in comparison to the 377 kilograms consumed in Paris. Caracas consumed seven times more meat per person than in Paris. Von Humboldt also said that the average income in that period was four times the European income and also that the cities of New Spain were richer than many European cities.{{sfn|von Humboldt|1811}}\n\n=== Contesting with other empires ===\n[[File:Spanish troops at Pensacola.jpg|thumb|upright|A Spanish army captures British [[Pensacola, Florida|Pensacola]] in 1781.

The relatively more peaceful century under the new monarchy had allowed it to rebuild and start the long process of modernizing its institutions and economy, and the demographic decline of the 17th century had been reversed. It was a middle-ranking power with great power pretensions that could not be ignored.

Spain actively supported the thirteen colonies throughout the [[American Revolutionary War]], beginning in 1776 by jointly funding [[Roderigue Hortalez and Company]], a trading company that provided critical military supplies, throughout financing the final [[Siege of Yorktown]] in 1781 with a collection of gold and silver from Havana.{{sfn|Victoria|2005}}\n\nSpanish aid was supplied to the colonies via four main routes: (1)from French ports with the funding of ''Roderigue Hortalez and Company'';\n(2)through the port of New Orleans and up the Mississippi river; (3)from warehouses in Havana; and (4)from the northwestern Spanish port of Bilbao, through the [[Gardoqui]] family trading company which supplied significant war materiel.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://home.nps.gov/applications/tuma/Detail.cfm?Personal_ID=18848 |website=National Park Service |title=Diego de Gardoqui: Personal Information}}\n\n*{{cite book |title=The Colonization of North America 1492 to 1783 |first1=Herbert E. |last1=Bolton |first2=Thomas Maitland |last2=Marshall |page=507}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Cuadro por espa\u00f1a y por el rey, Galvez en America.jpg|thumb|Painting of [[Bernardo de G\u00e1lvez|G\u00e1lvez]] at the [[Siege of Pensacola]] by Augusto Ferrer-Dalmau.]]\n\nBritain blockaded the thirteen colonies economically, so the American public debt increased dramatically. Spain, through the Gardoqui family, sent 120,000 silver 8 real coin, known as a [[Spanish dollar]], the coin upon which the original United States dollar was based, and it remained legal tender in the United States until the coinage act of 1857 (in fact the ''Spanish dollar'' or ''Carolus'' became the first global currency in the 18th century).<ref>{{cite web|title=Spanish Silver Dollar, 1774: Specifications|url=http://www.silentworldfoundation.org.au/products/collection/spanish-silver-dollar-1774/|website=www.silentworldfoundation.org.au}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Borders proposed by the Count of Aranda.svg|thumb|right|300px|North American borders proposed by the Spanish diplomacy led by the [[Pedro Pablo Abarca de Bolea, 10th Count of Aranda|Count of Aranda]] near the end of the American Revolutionary War, August 3rd, 1782]]\n\nThe Americans' Continental Army that won the [[Battles of Saratoga]] was partially equipped and armed by Spain. Spain had the chance to recover territories lost to Britain in the [[Seven Years' War]], particularly [[Florida]]. Galvez gathered an army from all corners of Spanish America, around 7,000 men. The Governor of Spanish Louisiana prepared an offensive against the British at the [[Gulf Coast campaign]] to control the lower Mississippi and Florida. G\u00e1lvez completed the conquest of West Florida in 1781 with the successful [[Siege of Pensacola]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Cardel\u00fas|first1=Borja|title=La huella de Espa\u00f1a y de la cultura hispana en los Estados Unidos|date=2007|publisher=Centro de Cultura Iberoamericana (CCI)|location=Madrid|isbn=9788461150366|edition=  2nd}}</ref>\n\nShortly thereafter, G\u00e1lvez conquered [[New Providence]] island in [[the Bahamas]], aborting the last British resistance plan, which kept the Spanish dominion over the Caribbean and accelerated the triumph of the American army. Jamaica was the last British stronghold of importance in the Caribbean. G\u00e1lvez organized a landing on the island; however, the [[Peace of Paris (1783)]] was concluded and the invasion cancelled.\n\n====Contestation in Brazil====\nThe majority of the territory of today's Brazil had been claimed as Spanish when exploration began with the navigation of the length of the [[Amazon River]] in 1541\u201342 by [[Francisco de Orellana]]. Many Spanish expeditions explored large parts of this vast region, especially those close to Spanish settlements. During the 16th and 17th centuries, Spanish soldiers, missionaries and adventurers also established pioneering communities, primarily in [[Paran\u00e1 (state)|Paran\u00e1]], Santa Catarina, and [[S\u00e3o Paulo]], and forts on the northeastern coast threatened by the French and Dutch.\n[[File:Imperios Espa\u00f1ol y Portugu\u00e9s 1790.svg|thumb|Spanish and Portuguese empires in 1790.]]\n\nAs Portuguese-Brazilian settlement expanded, following in the trail of the [[Bandeirantes]] exploits, these isolated Spanish groups were eventually integrated into Brazilian society. Only some Castilians who were displaced from the disputed areas of the Pampas of [[Rio Grande do Sul]] have left a significant influence on the formation of the [[gaucho]], when they mixed with Indian groups, Portuguese and blacks who arrived in the region during the 18th century. The Spanish were barred by their laws from slaving of indigenous people, leaving them without a commercial interest deep in the interior of the Amazon basin. The Laws of Burgos (1512) and the New Laws (1542) had been intended to protect the interests of indigenous people. The Portuguese-Brazilian slavers, the Bandeirantes, had the advantage of access from the mouth of the Amazon River, which was on the Portuguese side of the line of Tordesillas. One famous attack upon a Spanish mission in 1628 resulted in the enslavement of about 60,000 indigenous people.{{efn|text=An early bandeira in 1628, (led by [[Ant\u00f4nio Raposo Tavares]]), composed of 2,000 allied Indians, 900 Mamluks ([[Mestizo]]s) and 69 white [[S\u00e3o Paulo (state)|Paulistanos]], to find precious metals and stones and/or to capture Indians for slavery. This expedition alone was responsible for the destruction of most of the Jesuit missions of Spanish [[Guair\u00e1 Department|Guair\u00e1]] and the enslavement of 60,000 indigenous people. In response the missions that followed were heavily fortified.}}\n\nIn time, there was in effect a self-funding force of occupation. By the 18th century, much of the Spanish territory was under de facto control of Portuguese-Brazil. This reality was recognized with the legal transfer of sovereignty in 1750 of most of the Amazon basin and surrounding areas to Portugal in the [[Treaty of Madrid (13 January 1750)|Treaty of Madrid]]. This settlement sowed the seeds of the [[Guaran\u00ed War]] in 1756.\n\n====Rival empires in the Pacific Northwest====\n{{Main|Spanish expeditions to the Pacific Northwest}}\n[[File:NutcaEN.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Spanish territorial claims on the West Coast of North America in the 18th century, contested by the Russian empire and the British. Most of what Spain claimed in North America was not directly occupied or controlled.]]\n\nSpain claimed all of North America in the Age of Discovery, but claims were not translated into occupation until a major resource was discovered and Spanish settlement and crown rule put in place. The French had established an [[French America|empire]] in northern North America and took some islands in the Caribbean. The English established colonies on the eastern seaboard of North America and in northern North America and some Caribbean islands as well. In the eighteenth century, the Spanish crown realized that its territorial claims needed to be defended, particularly in the wake of its visible weakness during the Seven Years' War when Britain captured the important Spanish ports of Havana and Manila. Another important factor was that the [[Russian America|Russian empire]] had expanded into North America from the mid-eighteenth century, with [[Maritime fur trade|fur trading settlements]] in what is now Alaska and forts as far south as Fort Ross, California. Great Britain was also expanding into areas that Spain claimed as its territory on the Pacific coast. Taking steps to shore up its fragile claims to California, Spain began planning [[Spanish missions in California|California missions]] in 1769. Spain also began a series of voyages to the Pacific Northwest, where Russia and Great Britain were encroaching on claimed territory. The [[Spanish expeditions to the Pacific Northwest]], with [[Alessandro Malaspina]] and others sailing for Spain, came too late for Spain to assert its sovereignty in the Pacific Northwest.{{sfn|Kamen|2003|p=237, 485}} The [[Nootka Crisis]] (1789\u20131791) nearly brought Spain and Britain to war. It was a dispute over claims in the Pacific Northwest, where neither nation had established permanent settlements. The crisis could have led to war, but it was resolved in the [[Nootka Convention]], in which Spain and Great Britain agreed to not establish settlements and allowed free access to Nootka Sound on the west coast of what is now [[Vancouver Island]]. In 1806 Baron [[Nikolai Rezanov]] attempted to negotiate a treaty between the [[Russian-American Company]] and the [[Viceroyalty of New Spain]], but his unexpected death in 1807 ended any treaty hopes. Spain gave up its claims in the West of North America in the [[Adams-Onis Treaty]] of 1819, ceding its rights there to the United States, allowing the U.S. to purchase Florida, and establishing a boundary New Spain and the U.S. When the negotiations between the two nations were taking place, Spain's resources were stretched due to the [[Spanish American wars of independence]].<ref>Salvucci, Linda K. \"Adams-Onis Treaty (1819)\" in {{harvnb|Encyclopedia of Latin American History and Culture|1996|loc=vol. 1, pp. 11-12}}</ref>\n\n====Loss of Spanish Louisiana====\n{{Main|Louisiana (New Spain)}}\n[[File:SpanishEmpire1790.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|Spanish Empire in 1790. In North America, Spain claimed lands west of the [[Mississippi River]] and the Pacific coast from [[California]] to [[Alaska]], but it did not control them on the ground. The crown constructed missions and presidios in coastal California and [[Spanish expeditions to the Pacific Northwest|sent maritime expeditions]] to the Pacific Northwest to assert sovereignty.]]\n\nThe growth of trade and wealth in the colonies caused increasing political tensions as frustration grew with the improving but still restrictive trade with Spain. Malaspina's recommendation to turn the empire into a looser [[confederation]] to help improve governance and trade so as to quell the growing political tensions between the \u00e9lites of the empire's periphery and center was suppressed by a monarchy afraid of losing control. All was to be swept away by the tumult that was to overtake Europe at the turn of the 19th century with the [[French Revolutionary Wars|French Revolutionary]] and [[Napoleonic Wars]].\n\nThe first major territory Spain was to lose in the 19th century was the vast and wild [[Louisiana (New Spain)|Louisiana Territory]], which stretched north to Canada and was ceded by France in 1763 under the terms of the [[Treaty of Fontainebleau (1762)|Treaty of Fontainebleau]]. The French, under Napoleon, took back possession as part of the [[Third Treaty of San Ildefonso|Treaty of San Ildefonso]] in 1800 and sold it to the United States in the [[Louisiana Purchase]] of 1803. Napoleon's sale of the Louisiana Territory to the United States in 1803 caused border disputes between the United States and Spain that, with rebellions in [[West Florida]] (1810) and in the remainder of Louisiana at the mouth of the [[Mississippi river|Mississippi]], led to their eventual cession to the United States,\n\n====Other challenges to the Spanish Empire====\n[[File:Churruca death.jpg|thumb|''[[Cosme Dami\u00e1n de Churruca y Elorza|Churruca]]'s Death'', oil on canvas about the [[Battle of Trafalgar]] by [[Eugenio \u00c1lvarez Dumont]], [[Prado]] Museum.]]\n\nThe destruction of the main Spanish fleet, under French command, at the [[Battle of Trafalgar]] (1805) undermined Spain's ability to defend and hold on to its empire. The [[British invasions of the R\u00edo de la Plata]] attempted to seize the [[Viceroyalty of the R\u00edo de la Plata]] in 1806. The [[viceroy]] retreated hastily to the hills when defeated by a small British force. However, the ''[[Criollo people|Criollos]]''' militias and colonial army eventually repulsed the British. The later intrusion of Napoleonic forces into Spain in 1808 (see [[Peninsular War]]) cut off the effective connection with the empire. A combination of internal and external factors led to the unforeseen loss of most of Spain's empire in the Indies in the [[Spanish American wars of independence]].\n\n== End of the global empire (1808\u20131899) ==\n[[File:Mapa de la Am\u00e9rica espa\u00f1ola (1800).png|thumb|upright=1.35|The [[Americas]] towards the year 1800, the colored territories were considered provinces in some maps of the Spanish Empire.]]\n[[File:El dos de mayo de 1808 en Madrid.jpg|thumb|''[[The Second of May 1808]]: The Charge of the Mamelukes'', by [[Francisco de Goya]] (1814) showing Spanish resistance to French troops in Madrid]]\n\nIn 1808, Napoleon forces invaded the Iberian peninsula, resulting in the evacuation of the Portuguese royal family to Brazil and the [[Abdications of Bayonne|abdication]] of the Spanish King.

The French invasion also sparked in many places in Spanish America a crisis of legitimacy of crown rule and movements that resulted in political independence. In Spain, political uncertainty lasted over a decade and turmoil for several decades, civil wars on succession disputes, a republic, and finally a [[liberal democracy]]. Resistance coalesced around [[junta (Peninsular War)|juntas]], emergency ad-hoc governments. A [[Supreme Central and Governing Junta of the Kingdom]], ruling in the name of [[Ferdinand VII]], was created on 25 September 1808 to coordinate efforts among the various juntas.\n\n=== Spanish American conflicts and independence 1810-1833 ===\n{{Main|Spanish American wars of independence|Junta (Peninsular War)}}\n\nThe idea of a separate identity for Spanish America has been developed in the modern historical literature,{{sfn|Brading|1993}} but the idea of complete Spanish American independence from the Spanish Empire was not general at the time and political independence was not inevitable. Historian Brian Hamnett argues that had the Spanish monarchy and Spanish liberals been more flexible regarding the place of the overseas possessions, that the empire would not have collapsed.{{sfn|Hamnett| 2017}} Juntas emerged in Spanish America as Spain faced a political crisis due to the invasion by Napoleon Bonaparte and abdication of Ferdinand VII. Spanish Americans reacted in much the same way the Peninsular Spanish did, legitimizing their actions through traditional law, which held that sovereignty reverted to the people in the absence of a legitimate king.\n\nThe majority of Spanish Americans continued to support the idea of maintaining a [[monarchy]], but did not support retaining [[absolute monarchy]] under Ferdinand VII.<ref>\"Historians generally have assumed that these movements invoked the name of Fernando VII to mask their real goal: achieving independence\". 1998 Jaime E.

The juntas in the Americas did not accept the governments of the Europeans \u2013 neither the government set up for Spain by the French nor the various Spanish Governments set up in response to the French invasion. The juntas did not accept the Spanish regency, isolated under [[Siege of C\u00e1diz|siege in the city of Cadiz]] (1810\u20131812). They also rejected the [[Spanish Constitution of 1812]] although the Constitution gave Spanish citizenship those in the territories that had belonged to the Spanish monarchy in both hemispheres.<ref>{{cite book\n| last = Pe\u00f1a\n| first = Lorenzo\n| title = Un Puente jur\u00eddico entre Iberoam\u00e9rica y Europa: la Constituci\u00f3n espa\u00f1ola de 1812\n| language = Spanish\n| publisher = Casa de Am\u00e9rica-CSIC\n| year = 2002\n| isbn = 978-84-88490-55-1\n| pages = 6\u20137\n| url = http://digital.csic.es/bitstream/10261/9858/1/1812Cadiz.pdf\n}}</ref>\nThe liberal Spanish Constitution of 1812 recognized [[indigenous peoples of the Americas]] as Spanish citizens. But the acquisition of citizenship for any [[casta]] of [[Afro-American peoples of the Americas]] was through [[naturalization]] \u2013 excluding [[slaves]].\n\nA long period of wars followed in America from 1811 to 1829. In South America this period of wars led to the independence of [[Argentina]] (1810), [[Venezuela]] (1810), [[Chile]] (1810), [[Paraguay]] (1811) and [[Uruguay]] (1815, but subsequently ruled by Brazil until 1828). [[Jos\u00e9 de San Mart\u00edn]] campaigned for independence in [[Chile]] (1818) and in [[Peru]] (1821). Further north, [[Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar]] led forces that won independence between 1811 and 1826 for the area that became [[Venezuela]], [[Colombia]], [[Ecuador]], [[Per\u00fa]] and [[Bolivia]] (then [[Alto Per\u00fa]]). [[Panama]] declared independence in 1821 and merged with the [[Republic of Gran Colombia]] (from 1821 to 1903).\n \nIn the Viceroyalty of New Spain, free-thinking secular priest, [[Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla]], declared Mexican freedom in 1810 in the [[Grito de Dolores]]. Independence was actually won in 1821 by a royalist army officer turned insurgent, [[Agust\u00edn de Iturbide]], in alliance with insurgent [[Vicente Guerrero]] and under the [[Plan of Iguala]]. The conservative Catholic hierarchy in [[New Spain]] supported Mexican independence largely because it found the liberal Spanish [[Constitution of 1812]] abhorrent. Central America provinces became independent via Mexico's independence in 1821 and joined Mexico for a brief time (1822\u201323), but they chose their own path when Mexico became a republic in 1824.\n\nThe Spanish coastal fortifications in Veracruz, Callao and Chilo\u00e9 were the footholds that resisted until 1825 and 1826 respectively. In Spanish America, Royalist guerrillas continued the war in several countries, and Spain launched attempts to retake Venezuela in 1827 and Mexico in 1829. Spain  abandoned all plans of military re-conquest at the death of King Ferdinand VII in [[1833]]. Finally the Spanish government went so far as to renounce sovereignty over all of continental America in 1836.\n\n===Loss of Remnants in the Indies (1865-1899)===\n\n[[Dominican Republic|Santo Domingo]] likewise declared independence in 1821 and began negotiating for inclusion in Bolivar's [[Republic of Gran Colombia]], but was quickly occupied by [[Haiti]], which ruled it until [[Dominican War of Independence|an 1844 revolution]]. After 17 years of independence, in 1861, Santo Domingo was again [[Spanish occupation of the Dominican Republic|made a colony]] due to Haitian aggression, making it the only former colony that Spain retook. However, Captain-General [[Jos\u00e9 de la G\u00e1ndara y Navarro]] met opposition to his occupation of the island after his troops faced both guerrilla uprisings and [[yellow fever]]. In all, 10,888 of G\u00e1ndara's forces fell in combat against [[Dominican Restoration War|Dominican guerrillas]]. More devastating was disease, which claimed 30,000 Spaniards.\n\nAfter 1865, only Cuba and Puerto Rico and the [[Spanish East Indies]] (the [[Philippines]], [[Guam]] and nearby Pacific islands) remained under Spanish control in the Indies. The Cuban war for independence was cut short by U.S. intervention in what became known as the [[Spanish\u2013American War]] in 1898. Spain also lost Puerto Rico and the Philippines in that conflict.<ref name=\"avalon\">[http://avalon.law.yale.edu/19th_century/sp1898.asp Law.yale.edu: Treaty of Peace Between the United States and Spain]</ref> The following year, Spain then sold its remaining Pacific Ocean possessions to Germany in the [[German-Spanish Treaty (1899)|German\u2013Spanish Treaty]], retaining only its African territories.\n\n[[File:Spain in 1898.png|thumb|upright=1.35|The Spanish Empire in 1898]]\n\nSpain in the post-Napoleonic era was in political crisis, with the French invasion and restoration of the Spanish monarchy under the autocratic Ferdinand VII having broken apart any traditional consensus on sovereignty, fragmented the country politically and regionally and unleashed wars and disputes between progressives, liberals and conservatives. The instability inhibited Spain's development, which had started fitfully gathering pace in the eighteenth century. A brief period of improvement occurred in the 1870s when the capable [[Alfonso XII of Spain]] and his thoughtful ministers succeeded in restoring some vigor to Spanish politics and prestige, cut short by Alfonso's early death.\n\nAn increasing level of [[Spanish nationalism|nationalist]], anti-colonial uprisings in various colonies culminated with the Spanish\u2013American War of 1898, fought primarily over Cuba.

In 1958, Spain ceded Tarfaya to Mohammed V and joined the previously separate districts of [[Saguia el-Hamra]] (in the north) and [[R\u00edo de Oro]] (in the south) to form the province of [[Spanish Sahara]].\n\nIn 1959, the Spanish territory on the [[Gulf of Guinea]] was established with a status similar to the provinces of metropolitan Spain. As the Spanish Equatorial Region, it was ruled by a [[governor general]] exercising military and civilian powers. The first local elections were held in 1959, and the first Equatoguinean representatives were seated in the [[Cortes Generales|Spanish parliament]]. Under the Basic Law of December 1963, limited autonomy was authorized under a joint legislative body for the territory's two provinces. The name of the country was changed to [[Equatorial Guinea]]. In March 1968, under pressure from Equatoguinean nationalists and the United Nations, Spain announced that it would grant the country independence.\n\nIn 1969, under international pressure, Spain returned Sidi Ifni to Morocco. Spanish control of Spanish Sahara endured until the 1975 [[Green March]] prompted a withdrawal, under Moroccan military pressure. The future of this former Spanish colony remains uncertain.\n\nThe [[Canary Islands]] and Spanish cities in the African mainland are considered an equal part of Spain and the [[European Union]] but have a different tax system.\n\nMorocco still claims Ceuta, Melilla, and ''{{lang|es|[[plazas de soberan\u00eda]]}}'' even though they are internationally recognized as administrative divisions of Spain. [[Isla Perejil]] was occupied on 11 July 2002 by Moroccan Gendarmerie and troops, who were evicted by [[Spanish Navy|Spanish naval]] forces in a bloodless operation.\n\n==Legacy==\n[[File:Cathedral, City of Mexico. (15719792402).jpg|thumb|left|The [[Metropolitan Cathedral of Mexico City|Cathedral of Mexico City]] (1897) is the largest cathedral in Spanish America, built on the ruins of the Aztec central plaza.]]\n\nAlthough the Spanish Empire declined from its apogee in the middle seventeenth century, it remained a wonder for other Europeans for its sheer geographical span. [[London (Samuel Johnson poem)|Writing in 1738]], English poet [[Samuel Johnson]] questioned, \"Has heaven reserved, in pity to the poor,/No pathless waste or undiscovered shore,/No secret island in the boundless main,/No peaceful desert yet unclaimed by Spain?\"<ref>quoted in Simon Collier, \"The Spanish Conquests, 1492\u20131580\" in ''The Cambridge Encyclopedia of Latin America and the Caribbean''. New York: Cambridge University Press 1992, p. 194.</ref>\n\nThe Spanish Empire left a huge linguistic, religious, political, cultural, and urban architectural legacy in the [[Western Hemisphere]]. With over 470 million native speakers today, [[Spanish language|Spanish]] is the second [[List of languages by number of native speakers|most spoken native language]] in the world, as result of the introduction of the language of Castile\u2014Castilian, \"''Castellano''\" \u2014from Iberia to Spanish America, later expanded by the governments of successor independent republics. In the Philippines, the [[Spanish\u2013American War]] (1898) brought the islands under U.S. jurisdiction, with English being imposed in schools and Spanish becoming [[Languages of the Philippines|a secondary official language]].\n\n[[File:De espa\u00f1ol e india, mestiza.jpg|thumb|150px|A painting showing a Spanish man with a [[Native South American|Native American]] wife and their child. Mixed-race European Amerindians were referred to as [[Mestizo]]s.|left]]\n\nAn important cultural legacy of the Spanish empire overseas is [[Roman Catholicism]], which remains the main religious faith in Spanish America and the Philippines. Christian evangelization of indigenous peoples was a key responsibility of the crown and a justification for its imperial expansion. Although indigenous were considered neophytes and insufficiently mature in their faith for indigenous men to be ordained to the priesthood, the indigenous were part of the Catholic community of faith. Catholic orthodoxy enforced by the [[Holy Office of the Inquisition|Inquisition]], particularly targeting [[crypto-Jews]] and Protestants. Not until after their independence in the nineteenth century did Spanish American republics allow [[religious toleration]] of other faiths. Observances of Catholic holidays often have strong regional expressions and remain important in many parts of Spanish America. Observances include [[Day of the Dead]], [[Carnaval de Oruro|Carnival]], [[Holy Week in Popay\u00e1n|Holy Week]], [[Dancing devils of Corpus Christi|Corpus Christi]], [[Epiphany (holiday)|Epiphany]], and national saints' days, such as the [[Virgin of Guadalupe]] in Mexico.\n\nPolitically, the colonial era has strongly influenced modern Spanish America. The territorial divisions of the empire in Spanish America became the basis for boundaries between new republics after independence and for state divisions within countries. It is often argued that the rise of [[Caudillo|caudillismo]] during and after Latin American independence movements created a legacy of authoritarianism in the region.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Chiaramonte|first=Jos\u00e9 Carlos|date=2010-08-01|title=The \"Ancient Constitution\" after Independence (1808\u20131852)|journal=Hispanic American Historical Review|language=en|volume=90|issue=3|pages=455\u2013488|doi=10.1215/00182168-2010-003|issn=0018-2168}}</ref> There was no significant development of representative institutions during the colonial era, and the executive power was often made stronger than the legislative power during the national period as a result. Unfortunately, this has led to a popular misconception that the colonial legacy has caused the region to have an extremely oppressed proletariat. Revolts and riots are often seen as evidence of this supposed extreme oppression. However, the culture of revolting against an unpopular government is not simply a confirmation of widespread authoritarianism. The colonial legacy did leave a political culture of revolt, but not always as a desperate last act. The civil unrest of the region is seen by some as a form of political involvement. While the political context of the political revolutions in Spanish America is understood to be one in which liberal elites competed to form new national political structures, so too were those elites responding to mass lower-class political mobilization and participation.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hamnett|first=Brian R.|date=1997|title=Process and Pattern: A Re-Examination of the Ibero-American Independence Movements, 1808-1826|journal=Journal of Latin American Studies|volume=29|issue=2|pages=279\u2013328|issn=0022-216X|jstor=158396|doi=10.1017/S0022216X97004719}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Murales Rivera - Treppenhaus 3 Kaiser Maximilian.jpg|thumb|Detail of a Mural by [[Diego Rivera]] at the [[National Palace (Mexico)|National Palace of Mexico]] showing the ethnic differences between [[Agust\u00edn de Iturbide]], a ''[[Criollo people|criollo]]'', and the [[multiracial]] Mexican court]]\n\nHundreds of towns and cities in the Americas were founded during the Spanish rule, with the colonial centers and buildings of many of them now designated as [[UNESCO World Heritage Sites]] attracting tourists. The tangible heritage includes universities, forts, cities, cathedrals, schools, hospitals, missions, government buildings and colonial residences, many of which still stand today. A number of present-day roads, canals, ports or bridges sit where Spanish engineers built them centuries ago. The oldest universities in the Americas were founded by Spanish scholars and Catholic missionaries. The Spanish Empire also left a vast [[Hispanic|cultural and linguistic legacy]]. The cultural legacy is also present in the [[music of Latin America|music]], [[cuisine]], and [[fashion]], some of which have been granted the status of [[UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists|UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage]].\n\nThe long colonial period in [[Hispanic America|Spanish America]] resulted in a mixing of indigenous peoples, Europeans, and Africans that were [[casta|classified by race and hierarchically ranked]], therefore there was a mixed race society in the Spanish and Portuguese Americas compared to the starkly segregated settler colonies of the British and French in North America.\n\nIn concert with the [[Portuguese Empire]], the Spanish Empire laid the foundations of a truly global trade by opening up the great trans-oceanic trade routes and the exploration of unknown territories and oceans for the western knowledge. The [[Spanish Dollar]] became the world's first global currency.\n\nOne of the features of this trade was the exchange of a great array of domesticated plants and animals between the Old World and the New in the [[Columbian Exchange]]. Some cultivars that were introduced to America included grapes, wheat, barley, apples and citrous fruits; animals that were introduced to the New World were horses, donkeys, cattle, sheep, goats, pigs, and chickens. The Old World received from America such things as maize, potatoes, chili peppers, tomatoes, tobacco, beans, squash, cacao (chocolate), vanilla, avocados, pineapples, chewing gum, rubber, peanuts, cashews, Brazil nuts, pecans, blueberries, strawberries, quinoa, amaranth, chia, agave and others. The result of these exchanges was to significantly improve the agricultural potential of not only in America, but also that of Europe and Asia. Diseases brought by Europeans and Africans, such as smallpox, measles, typhus, and others, devastated almost all indigenous populations that had no immunity, with [[syphilis]] the exchange from the New World to Old.\n\nThere were also cultural influences, which can be seen in everything from architecture to food, music, art and law, from Southern [[Argentina]] and [[Chile]] to the [[United States|United States of America]] together with the [[Philippines]]. The complex origins and contacts of different peoples resulted in cultural influences coming together in the varied forms so evident today in the former colonial areas.\n\n== See also

The bombing occurred in the first days of the German-led [[Axis powers|Axis]] [[invasion of Yugoslavia]] during [[World War II]]. The [[Royal Yugoslav Army Air Force]] (VVKJ) had only 77 modern [[fighter aircraft]] available to defend Belgrade against the hundreds of German fighters and [[bomber]]s that struck in the first wave early on 6 April. Three days prior, VVKJ [[Major]] [[Vladimir Kren]] had defected to the Germans, disclosing the locations of multiple military assets and divulging the VVKJ's codes.\n\nThree more waves of bombers attacked Belgrade on 6 April, and more attacks followed in subsequent days. The attacks resulted in the paralysis of Yugoslav civilian and military command and control, the widespread destruction of Belgrade's infrastructure, and many civilian casualties. The ground invasion had begun a few hours earlier, and air attacks were also made on VVKJ airfields and other strategic targets across Yugoslavia. Among the non-military targets struck during the bombing were the [[National Library of Serbia]], which burned to the ground with the loss of hundreds of thousands of books and manuscripts, and the [[Belgrade Zoo]].\n\nThe [[Royal Air Force]] carried out two bombing raids on [[Sofia]], the capital of Bulgaria, in retaliation for the attacks on Yugoslavia, which surrendered on 17 April. The senior [[Luftwaffe]] officer responsible for the bombing, ''[[Generaloberst]]'' [[Alexander L\u00f6hr]], was captured by the Yugoslavs at the end of the war and was tried and executed for war crimes, in part for his involvement in the bombing of Belgrade. Kren was arrested in 1947 on unrelated charges of war crimes stemming from his subsequent service as the head of the [[Air Force of the Independent State of Croatia]]. He was extradited to Yugoslavia to face trial, convicted on all counts, and executed in 1948. A monument erected in [[New Belgrade]] in 1997 commemorates the Yugoslav airmen who were killed in Belgrade's defence. The bombing has been dramatised in literature and film.\n\n== Background ==\n=== Yugoslav coup d'\u00e9tat ===\n{{Main|Yugoslav coup d'\u00e9tat|Tripartite Pact}}\nFollowing Germany's 1938 ''[[Anschluss]]'' of Austria, [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] shared a border with the Third Reich and came under increasing pro-[[Axis powers|Axis]] political pressure as its neighbours fell into line with the Axis powers. In April 1939, Yugoslavia gained a second frontier with Italy when [[Italian invasion of Albania|Italy invaded Albania]]. Between September and November 1940, Hungary joined the [[Tripartite Pact]], Italy [[Greco-Italian War|invaded Greece]], and Romania also joined the Pact.{{sfn|Roberts|1973|pp=6\u20137}} From that time, Yugoslavia was almost surrounded by Axis powers or their [[client state]]s, and its neutral stance toward the war was under tremendous pressure. On 14 February 1941, [[Adolf Hitler]] invited Prime Minister [[Dragi\u0161a Cvetkovi\u0107]] and Foreign Minister [[Aleksandar Cincar-Markovi\u0107]] to [[Berchtesgaden]], and requested that Yugoslavia also join the Pact.{{sfn|Presseisen|1960|p=367}} On 1 March, Bulgaria joined, and the next day, German troops entered Bulgaria from Romania, closing the ring around Yugoslavia.{{sfn|Roberts|1973|p=12}}\n\nFurther pressure was applied by Hitler on 4 March 1941, when the Yugoslav regent, Prince [[Prince Paul of Yugoslavia|Paul]], visited Berchtesgaden, but the prince delayed a decision.{{sfn|Roberts|1973|p=12}} On 6 March, the [[Royal Yugoslav Army Air Force]] ({{lang-sh|Vazduhoplovstvo Vojske Kraljevine Jugoslavije}}, VVKJ) was secretly mobilised.{{sfn|Shores|Cull|Malizia|1987|p=177}} The following day, British troops began landing in Greece to bolster the country's defences against the Italians.{{sfn|Roberts|1973|p=13}} On 12 March, the VVKJ began dispersing to auxiliary airfields. By 20 March, the VVKJ's dispersal had been completed.{{sfn|Shores|Cull|Malizia|1987|p=177}} Hitler, wishing to secure his southern flank in anticipation of Germany's impending [[Operation Barbarossa|invasion of the Soviet Union]], demanded that Yugoslavia sign the Pact. On 25 March, the Yugoslav government [[Yugoslav accession to the Tripartite Pact|complied]].{{sfn|Milazzo|1975|p=2}} Two days later, a group of VVKJ and Yugoslav [[Royal Guard]] officers, led by [[Brigadier General]] [[Borivoje Mirkovi\u0107]], [[Yugoslav coup d'\u00e9tat|deposed]] Prince Paul.{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|pp=43\u201344}} He was replaced by his 17-year-old nephew [[Peter II of Yugoslavia|Peter]], who was scheduled to ascend to the throne on his birthday.{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|p=47}}\n\n=== Preparations ===\n{{Main|Yugoslav order of battle prior to the invasion of Yugoslavia}}\nThe day of the coup, Hitler issued [[Adolf Hitler's directives|Directive 25]], which stated that the coup had changed the political situation in the [[Balkans]]. He ordered that \"even if Yugoslavia at first should give declarations of loyalty, she must be considered as a foe and therefore must be destroyed as quickly as possible\".{{sfn|Roberts|1973|p=15}} German reconnaissance aircraft frequently violated Yugoslav airspace in the aftermath of the coup. VVKJ [[fighter aircraft|fighters]] were placed on constant alert. The German incursions demonstrated that the Yugoslav ground observation post network and supporting radio communications were inadequate.{{sfn|Shores|Cull|Malizia|1987|p=177}} Hitler decided that [[Belgrade]] would be bombed as punishment for the coup, under the codename Operation Retribution (''Unternehmen Strafgericht''). On 27 and 28 March 1941, ''[[Reichsmarschall]]'' [[Hermann G\u00f6ring]] transferred about 500 fighter and bomber aircraft from France and northern Germany to airfields near the Yugoslav border. The commander of [[Luftflotte 4|''Luftflotte'' IV]], ''[[Generaloberst]]'' (General) [[Alexander L\u00f6hr]], allocated these aircraft to attack the Yugoslav capital in waves by day and night. L\u00f6hr issued his orders for the bombing on 31 March, but the decision to bomb Belgrade would not be confirmed by Hitler until 5 April.{{sfn|Schreiber|Stegemann|Vogel|1995|p=497}} Hitler ordered the general destruction of Belgrade, but at the last minute L\u00f6hr replaced these general directions with specific military objectives within the city.{{sfn|Boog|Krebs|Vogel|2006|p=366}}\n\nOn 3 April, [[Major]] [[Vladimir Kren]] flew a [[Potez 25]] aircraft to [[Graz]] and defected to the Germans. He disclosed the locations of many of Yugoslavia's dispersal airfields, as well as codes used by the VVKJ, which had to be quickly changed.{{sfn|Shores|Cull|Malizia|1987|p=177}} Also disclosed were the location of Yugoslavia's troop mobilisation centres and air-raid shelters in Belgrade.{{sfn|Terzi\u0107|1982|p=286}} On the afternoon of 5 April, a British [[Colonel (United Kingdom)|colonel]] visited Mirkovi\u0107 at the VVKJ base in [[Zemun]] and informed him that the attack on Belgrade would commence at 06:30 the next day.{{sfn|Shores|Cull|Malizia|1987|p=177}} The previous day, the Yugoslav government had declared Belgrade an [[open city]] in the event of hostilities. The German embassy had informed its government that Belgrade did not contain any [[Anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft defences]], but in an effort to justify the attack to the public, German propaganda branded the city \"Fortress Belgrade\" after the first bombs were dropped.{{sfn|Schreiber|Stegemann|Vogel|1995|p=497}}\n\nBy 6 April, the VVKJ had been almost completely mobilised, and consisted of four air brigades with more than 423 aircraft of Yugoslav, German, Italian, French, Czech and British design, including 107 modern fighters and 100 modern [[medium bomber]]s. Other than a small number of locally made [[Rogo\u017earski IK-3]] fighters, almost all the modern aircraft available to the VVKJ were of German, Italian or British design for which limited spares and munitions were available.{{sfn|Shores|Cull|Malizia|1987|p=173}} The available aircraft were spread all over the country, and only the 1st Fighter Brigade was near enough to Belgrade to respond to an attack on the capital. In total, the 1st Fighter Brigade fielded 56 [[Messerschmitt Bf 109]]E-3a fighters, 15 [[Hawker Hurricane]] MkIs, and six Rogo\u017earski IK-3s.{{sfn|Shores|Cull|Malizia|1987|pp=187\u2013188}}\n\n== Bombing ==\n{{also|Invasion of Yugoslavia}}\n[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-F016226-0005A, Belgrad, Altes Schloss, Sch\u00e4den.jpg|thumb|right|The bomb-damaged [[Stari dvor|Old Palace]] in central Belgrade, struck during the first wave of bombing on 6 April 1941|alt=Trucks travelling along wide tree-lined street with large old building in the background]]\nGerman ground forces crossed the Yugoslav border at 05:15 on 6 April, and the Reich Minister of Propaganda, [[Joseph Goebbels]], announced Germany's declaration of war at 06:00.{{sfn|Shores|Cull|Malizia|1987|p=179}} The invasion and concurrent bombing coincided with [[Easter]] Sunday as observed by the [[Serbian Orthodox Church]], which uses the [[Julian calendar]].{{sfn|Zaki\u0107|2017|p=64}} Yugoslav anti-aircraft defences caused a false alarm when they reported the approach of an air raid from the direction of Romania at 03:00, but listening posts on the Romanian border had heard the aircraft engines of the Romanian-based ''Fliegerf\u00fchrer'' Arad warming up well before they took off. The VVKJ's 51st Fighter Group at Zemun had been alerted before dawn, and when reports began to be received about Luftwaffe attacks on VVKJ airfields, the first patrol was sent into the air.

Punishment).{{sfn|Chant|1986|p=17}} [[Martin Gilbert]], a historian specialising in the [[Holocaust]], writes that the operation was codenamed ''[[wikt:castigo|Castigo]]'' (\"punishment\").{{sfn|Gilbert|1989|p=170}} The historian Vladimir Terzi\u0107 offers the [[Serbo-Croatian]] translation, ''Kazna'' (\"punishment\").{{sfn|Terzi\u0107|1982|p=283}}|group=lower-alpha}} was the April 1941 German [[Strategic bombing|bombing]] of [[Belgrade]], the capital of [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]], in retaliation for the [[Yugoslav coup d'\u00e9tat|coup d'\u00e9tat]] that overthrew the government that had signed the [[Tripartite Pact]]. The bombing occurred in the first days of the German-led [[Axis powers|Axis]] [[invasion of Yugoslavia]] during [[World War II]]. The [[Royal Yugoslav Army Air Force]] (VVKJ) had only 77 modern [[fighter aircraft]] available to defend Belgrade against the hundreds of German fighters and [[bomber]]s that struck in the first wave early on 6 April. Three days prior, VVKJ [[Major]] [[Vladimir Kren]] had defected to the Germans, disclosing the locations of multiple military assets and divulging the VVKJ's codes.\n\nThree more waves of bombers attacked Belgrade on 6 April, and more attacks followed in subsequent days. The attacks resulted in the paralysis of Yugoslav civilian and military command and control, the widespread destruction of Belgrade's infrastructure, and many civilian casualties. The ground invasion had begun a few hours earlier, and air attacks were also made on VVKJ airfields and other strategic targets across Yugoslavia. Among the non-military targets struck during the bombing were the [[National Library of Serbia]], which burned to the ground with the loss of hundreds of thousands of books and manuscripts, and the [[Belgrade Zoo]].\n\nThe [[Royal Air Force]] carried out two bombing raids on [[Sofia]], the capital of Bulgaria, in retaliation for the attacks on Yugoslavia, which surrendered on 17 April. The senior [[Luftwaffe]] officer responsible for the bombing, ''[[Generaloberst]]'' [[Alexander L\u00f6hr]], was captured by the Yugoslavs at the end of the war and was tried and executed for war crimes, in part for his involvement in the bombing of Belgrade. Kren was arrested in 1947 on unrelated charges of war crimes stemming from his subsequent service as the head of the [[Air Force of the Independent State of Croatia]]. He was extradited to Yugoslavia to face trial, convicted on all counts, and executed in 1948. A monument erected in [[New Belgrade]] in 1997 commemorates the Yugoslav airmen who were killed in Belgrade's defence. The bombing has been dramatised in literature and film.\n\n== Background ==\n=== Yugoslav coup d'\u00e9tat ===\n{{Main|Yugoslav coup d'\u00e9tat|Tripartite Pact}}\nFollowing Germany's 1938 ''[[Anschluss]]'' of Austria, [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] shared a border with the Third Reich and came under increasing pro-[[Axis powers|Axis]] political pressure as its neighbours fell into line with the Axis powers. In April 1939, Yugoslavia gained a second frontier with Italy when [[Italian invasion of Albania|Italy invaded Albania]]. Between September and November 1940, Hungary joined the [[Tripartite Pact]], Italy [[Greco-Italian War|invaded Greece]], and Romania also joined the Pact.{{sfn|Roberts|1973|pp=6\u20137}} From that time, Yugoslavia was almost surrounded by Axis powers or their [[client state]]s, and its neutral stance toward the war was under tremendous pressure. On 14 February 1941, [[Adolf Hitler]] invited Prime Minister [[Dragi\u0161a Cvetkovi\u0107]] and Foreign Minister [[Aleksandar Cincar-Markovi\u0107]] to [[Berchtesgaden]], and requested that Yugoslavia also join the Pact.{{sfn|Presseisen|1960|p=367}} On 1 March, Bulgaria joined, and the next day, German troops entered Bulgaria from Romania, closing the ring around Yugoslavia.{{sfn|Roberts|1973|p=12}}\n\nFurther pressure was applied by Hitler on 4 March 1941, when the Yugoslav regent, Prince [[Prince Paul of Yugoslavia|Paul]], visited Berchtesgaden, but the prince delayed a decision.{{sfn|Roberts|1973|p=12}} On 6 March, the [[Royal Yugoslav Army Air Force]] ({{lang-sh|Vazduhoplovstvo Vojske Kraljevine Jugoslavije}}, VVKJ) was secretly mobilised.{{sfn|Shores|Cull|Malizia|1987|p=177}} The following day, British troops began landing in Greece to bolster the country's defences against the Italians.{{sfn|Roberts|1973|p=13}} On 12 March, the VVKJ began dispersing to auxiliary airfields. By 20 March, the VVKJ's dispersal had been completed.{{sfn|Shores|Cull|Malizia|1987|p=177}} Hitler, wishing to secure his southern flank in anticipation of Germany's impending [[Operation Barbarossa|invasion of the Soviet Union]], demanded that Yugoslavia sign the Pact. On 25 March, the Yugoslav government [[Yugoslav accession to the Tripartite Pact|complied]].{{sfn|Milazzo|1975|p=2}} Two days later, a group of VVKJ and Yugoslav [[Royal Guard]] officers, led by [[Brigadier General]] [[Borivoje Mirkovi\u0107]], [[Yugoslav coup d'\u00e9tat|deposed]] Prince Paul.{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|pp=43\u201344}} He was replaced by his 17-year-old nephew [[Peter II of Yugoslavia|Peter]], who was scheduled to ascend to the throne on his birthday.{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|p=47}}\n\n=== Preparations ===\n{{Main|Yugoslav order of battle prior to the invasion of Yugoslavia}}\nThe day of the coup, Hitler issued [[Adolf Hitler's directives|Directive 25]], which stated that the coup had changed the political situation in the [[Balkans]]. He ordered that \"even if Yugoslavia at first should give declarations of loyalty, she must be considered as a foe and therefore must be destroyed as quickly as possible\".{{sfn|Roberts|1973|p=15}} German reconnaissance aircraft frequently violated Yugoslav airspace in the aftermath of the coup. VVKJ [[fighter aircraft|fighters]] were placed on constant alert. The German incursions demonstrated that the Yugoslav ground observation post network and supporting radio communications were inadequate.{{sfn|Shores|Cull|Malizia|1987|p=177}} Hitler decided that [[Belgrade]] would be bombed as punishment for the coup, under the codename Operation Retribution (''Unternehmen Strafgericht''). On 27 and 28 March 1941, ''[[Reichsmarschall]]'' [[Hermann G\u00f6ring]] transferred about 500 fighter and bomber aircraft from France and northern Germany to airfields near the Yugoslav border. The commander of [[Luftflotte 4|''Luftflotte'' IV]], ''[[Generaloberst]]'' (General) [[Alexander L\u00f6hr]], allocated these aircraft to attack the Yugoslav capital in waves by day and night. L\u00f6hr issued his orders for the bombing on 31 March, but the decision to bomb Belgrade would not be confirmed by Hitler until 5 April.{{sfn|Schreiber|Stegemann|Vogel|1995|p=497}} Hitler ordered the general destruction of Belgrade, but at the last minute L\u00f6hr replaced these general directions with specific military objectives within the city.{{sfn|Boog|Krebs|Vogel|2006|p=366}}\n\nOn 3 April, [[Major]] [[Vladimir Kren]] flew a [[Potez 25]] aircraft to [[Graz]] and defected to the Germans. He disclosed the locations of many of Yugoslavia's dispersal airfields, as well as codes used by the VVKJ, which had to be quickly changed.{{sfn|Shores|Cull|Malizia|1987|p=177}} Also disclosed were the location of Yugoslavia's troop mobilisation centres and air-raid shelters in Belgrade.{{sfn|Terzi\u0107|1982|p=286}} On the afternoon of 5 April, a British [[Colonel (United Kingdom)|colonel]] visited Mirkovi\u0107 at the VVKJ base in [[Zemun]] and informed him that the attack on Belgrade would commence at 06:30 the next day.{{sfn|Shores|Cull|Malizia|1987|p=177}} The previous day, the Yugoslav government had declared Belgrade an [[open city]] in the event of hostilities. The German embassy had informed its government that Belgrade did not contain any [[Anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft defences]], but in an effort to justify the attack to the public, German propaganda branded the city \"Fortress Belgrade\" after the first bombs were dropped.{{sfn|Schreiber|Stegemann|Vogel|1995|p=497}}\n\nBy 6 April, the VVKJ had been almost completely mobilised, and consisted of four air brigades with more than 423 aircraft of Yugoslav, German, Italian, French, Czech and British design, including 107 modern fighters and 100 modern [[medium bomber]]s. Other than a small number of locally made [[Rogo\u017earski IK-3]] fighters, almost all the modern aircraft available to the VVKJ were of German, Italian or British design for which limited spares and munitions were available.{{sfn|Shores|Cull|Malizia|1987|p=173}} The available aircraft were spread all over the country, and only the 1st Fighter Brigade was near enough to Belgrade to respond to an attack on the capital. In total, the 1st Fighter Brigade fielded 56 [[Messerschmitt Bf 109]]E-3a fighters, 15 [[Hawker Hurricane]] MkIs, and six Rogo\u017earski IK-3s.{{sfn|Shores|Cull|Malizia|1987|pp=187\u2013188}}\n\n== Bombing ==\n{{also|Invasion of Yugoslavia}}\n[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-F016226-0005A, Belgrad, Altes Schloss, Sch\u00e4den.jpg|thumb|right|The bomb-damaged [[Stari dvor|Old Palace]] in central Belgrade, struck during the first wave of bombing on 6 April 1941|alt=Trucks travelling along wide tree-lined street with large old building in the background]]\nGerman ground forces crossed the Yugoslav border at 05:15 on 6 April, and the Reich Minister of Propaganda, [[Joseph Goebbels]], announced Germany's declaration of war at 06:00.{{sfn|Shores|Cull|Malizia|1987|p=179}} The invasion and concurrent bombing coincided with [[Easter]] Sunday as observed by the [[Serbian Orthodox Church]], which uses the [[Julian calendar]].{{sfn|Zaki\u0107|2017|p=64}} Yugoslav anti-aircraft defences caused a false alarm when they reported the approach of an air raid from the direction of Romania at 03:00, but listening posts on the Romanian border had heard the aircraft engines of the Romanian-based ''Fliegerf\u00fchrer'' Arad warming up well before they took off. The VVKJ's 51st Fighter Group at Zemun had been alerted before dawn, and when reports began to be received about Luftwaffe attacks on VVKJ airfields, the first patrol was sent into the air. At first, no aircraft could be seen approaching Belgrade.{{sfn|Shores|Cull|Malizia|1987|p=196}}\n\nThe first wave closed on Belgrade between 06:30 and 06:45, and consisted of 74 [[Junkers Ju 87]] ''Stuka'' dive bombers, and 160 [[Heinkel He 111]] medium bombers and [[Dornier Do 17]] [[light bomber]]s at {{convert|8000|-|10000|ft|m}}. They were escorted by [[Messerschmitt Bf 110]] [[heavy fighter]]s at {{convert|11000|-|12000|ft|m}} and 100 Messerschmitt Bf 109E fighters at {{convert|15000|ft|m}}.{{sfn|Terzi\u0107|1982|p=283}}{{sfn|Shores|Cull|Malizia|1987|p=195}} The entire Yugoslav 6th Fighter Brigade, consisting of the 51st Fighter Group at Zemun and the 32nd Fighter Group at [[Prnjavor (Belgrade)#Boroughs|Prnjavor]], totalling 29 Messerschmitt Bf 109Es and five Rogo\u017earski IK-3s, were scrambled to intercept the Germans.{{sfn|Shores|Cull|Malizia|1987|pp=196\u2013197}} The Yugoslavs were quickly engaged by escorting Messerschmitt Bf 109Es from [[Jagdgeschwader 77|''Jagdgeschwader'' 77]] (JG 77). Just as the first wave was departing, Hawker Hurricane Mk1s of the 52nd Fighter Group of the 2nd Fighter Regiment based at [[Kni\u0107]] arrived over Belgrade and engaged some dive bombers, claiming one ''Stuka'' shot down. During the first attack, the Yugoslavs claimed fifteen German aircraft shot down and lost five of their own, with six more badly damaged. The pilots of JG 77 claimed ten Yugoslav machines shot down and another six destroyed on the ground.{{sfn|Shores|Cull|Malizia|1987|pp=196\u2013198}} On his return to base, the commander of the 51st Fighter Group was relieved of his command for failure to take action.{{sfn|Shores|Cull|Malizia|1987|p=199}} The first wave hit the Belgrade power station, the [[General Post Office, Belgrade|post office]] including telegraph and postal services, the headquarters of the Ministry of Army and Navy, the [[Supreme Command (Kingdom of Yugoslavia)|Yugoslav Supreme Command]] building, the [[Military Academy (Serbia)|military academy]], the [[Royal Compound, Belgrade|royal palace at Dedinje]], the royal guard barracks at [[Top\u010dider]], the gendarmerie command headquarters, and the airport at Zemun, among other targets.{{sfn|Terzi\u0107|1982|p=286}}\n\nImmediately after the first wave, King Peter, the Government of Yugoslavia and the Yugoslav Supreme Command left Belgrade and retreated to Yugoslavia's mountainous interior with the intention of going into exile.{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|p=50}}{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2007|p=17}} The second wave of German aircraft arrived over Belgrade about 10:00, consisting of 57 Ju 87 dive bombers and 30 Bf 109E fighters. They were met by 15 of the remaining fighters from the 6th Fighter Brigade. This time the Yugoslavs claimed two dive bombers forced down, and one Bf 109E shot down. A patrol of Bf 109Es from the Yugoslav 31st Fighter Group based at [[Kragujevac]], acting without orders from their group commander, followed the Germans as they returned to their bases and claimed two dive bombers shot down for the loss of both Yugoslav aircraft.{{sfn|Shores|Cull|Malizia|1987|p=199}}\n[[File:Bombed National Library Belgrad.JPG|thumb|left|A 2008 photograph of the ruins of the National Library of Serbia, bombed on 6 April 1941|alt=an overgrown crater with ruined walls around part of the perimeter]]\nBelgrade was targeted on two other occasions on the first day of the invasion. The third wave struck at 14:00, consisting of 94 twin-engined bombers flying from airfields near [[Vienna]], escorted by 60 fighters. This wave was met by eighteen fighters of the 6th Fighter Regiment, which claimed four German aircraft. The fourth attack of the day approached Belgrade at 16:00, comprising 97 dive bombers and 60 fighters.{{sfn|Shores|Cull|Malizia|1987|p=199}}\n\nThe Germans claimed nineteen Yugoslav Bf 109E fighters and four unidentified aircraft destroyed on 6 April. Actual Yugoslav aircraft losses on the first day were ten shot down and fifteen damaged. The Yugoslavs claimed to have shot down twenty-two German aircraft and forced two others to land. The Germans lost twelve aircraft, significantly fewer than claimed by the Yugoslavs: two Do 17Z light bombers, five Bf 110 heavy fighters, four Ju 87 dive bombers, and one Bf 109E fighter.{{sfn|Shores|Cull|Malizia|1987|p=199}} One Luftwaffe pilot who claimed his first victory over Belgrade on 6 April was ''[[Oberleutnant]]'' [[Gerhard Koall]] of [[Jagdgeschwader 54|''Jagdgeschwader'' 54]].{{sfn|Shores|Cull|Malizia|1987|p=199}} He went on to be credited with 37 victories and was awarded the [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross]] in 1944.{{sfn|Fellgiebel|2000|p=216}}\n\nGerman bombers and dive-bombers dropped {{convert|215|-|360|LT|ST}} of [[aerial bomb|bombs]] and [[Incendiary device|incendiaries]] on the capital.{{sfn|Zajac|1993|p=31}}{{sfn|Knell|2009|p=194}} The weak VVKJ and inadequate anti-aircraft defences of Belgrade briefly attempted to meet the overwhelming Luftwaffe assault, but were eliminated as threats during the first wave of the attack. Sources vary regarding the success achieved by the defenders. A US Army study first published in 1953 states that the Luftwaffe lost two fighter aircraft, downed 20 Yugoslav aircraft and destroyed a further 44 on the ground.{{sfn|U.S. Army|1986|p=49}} The military historian Daniel L. Zajac writes that the Germans lost 40 aircraft during the two-day air battle.{{sfn|Zajac|1993|p=31}} Another source indicates the loss of 14 German aircraft on 6 April.{{sfn|Shores|Cull|Malizia|1987|pp=200\u2013208}} Dive-bombers in subsequent waves were able to operate at rooftop altitude.{{sfn|U.S. Army|1986|p=49}}\n\nAccording to the historian [[Stevan K. Pavlowitch]], the bombing of Belgrade lasted three days.{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2007|p=17}} Other sources state the air battle over Belgrade lasted only two days owing to poor flying conditions on 8 April.{{sfn|Zajac|1993|p=31}} The most important cultural institution that was destroyed was the [[National Library of Serbia]], which was hit by bombs and gutted by fire. Hundreds of thousands of rare books, maps, and [[medieval]] manuscripts were destroyed.{{sfn|Norris|2008|p=41}} Also struck was the [[Belgrade Zoo]], sending frightened animals running through the streets.{{sfn|Freeman|2008|p=94}}\n\n== British retaliation ==\n[[No. 37 Squadron RAF|No. 37 Squadron]] of the [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) conducted [[Bombing of Sofia in World War II|two bombing raids]] on [[Sofia]], the capital of Bulgaria, in retaliation for the bombing of Belgrade. Operating [[Vickers Wellington]] bombers from an airfield in Greece, the squadron conducted raids on 6/7 April and 12/13 April, dropping a total of {{convert|30|LT|ST}} of high-explosive bombs on railway targets and nearby residential areas. These raids were carried out despite the fact that Britain was not at war with Bulgaria until 12 December 1941. The historian Herman Knell calls the retaliatory justification for these raids \"strange and implausible\".{{sfn|Knell|2009|p=195}} The aviation historians Shores, Cull and Malizia indicate that these raids were attacks on the lines of communication of German forces attacking Greece and Yugoslavia, and note that the raid on 6/7 April targeted an ammunition train and other installations in Sofia, and the raid on 12/13 April bombed the railway marshalling yards. Other similar targets in Bulgaria were attacked by the RAF during the [[Balkans Campaign (World War II)|Balkans Campaign]].{{sfn|Shores|Cull|Malizia|1987|pp=232, 243}}\n\n== Aftermath and legacy ==\n[[File:Spomenik pilotima 1941.JPG|thumb|upright|Monument to the Yugoslav pilots killed during Operation Retribution, located in [[New Belgrade]]|alt=rectangular polished dark stone plinth pointing toward the sky, with a winged plaque and inscription at the base]]\nThe bombing of Belgrade paralysed communications between the Yugoslav military and its headquarters, and contributed decisively to the rapid collapse of Yugoslav resistance.{{sfn|Boog|Krebs|Vogel|2006|p=366}} Civilian casualties were significant, but sources vary widely from 1,500 to 17,000 killed.{{sfn|Knell|2009|pp=194\u2013195}} They were worsened by the disclosure of air-raid shelter locations to the Germans in the days preceding the attack.{{sfn|Terzi\u0107|1982|p=286}} The official casualty figure released by the occupation authorities soon after the bombing was 2,271 killed. Other sources mention 5,000 to 10,000 fatalities, and later Yugoslav estimates ranged even higher.{{sfn|Roberts|1973|p=16}}{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2007|p=18}} The historian [[Jozo Tomasevich]] writes that the higher estimates were downgraded following \"careful postwar investigations\", and indicates that a figure between 3,000 and 4,000 is more realistic.{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|p=74}}\n\nBelgrade was occupied on 13 April 1941, and four days later, Yugoslavia capitulated.{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2007|p=19}} Afterwards, Luftwaffe engineers conducted a bomb damage assessment in Belgrade. The report stated that {{convert|218.5|MT}} of bombs were dropped, 10 to 14 percent being incendiaries. It listed all the targets of the bombing, mentioned that seven aerial mines were dropped, and that areas in the centre and north-west of the city had been destroyed, comprising 20 to 25 percent of its total area. Some aspects of the bombing remain unexplained, particularly the use of the aerial mines.{{sfn|Boog|Krebs|Vogel|2006|p=366}} Significant damage was done to Belgrade, particularly to the water and electrical systems.{{sfn|Terzi\u0107|1982|p=286}} Pavlowitch states that almost 50 percent of housing in Belgrade was destroyed.{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2007|pp=17\u201318}} After the invasion, the Germans forced between 3,500 and 4,000 [[Jews]] to collect rubble that was caused by the bombing.{{sfn|Ramet|2006|p=131}} Unexploded German bombs continue to be unearthed in the 21st century.{{sfn|Nikolic 28 July 2015}}\n\nL\u00f6hr was captured by the [[Yugoslav Partisans]] on 9 May 1945, escaped, and was recaptured on 13 May. He was intensively interrogated, after which he was tried before a Yugoslav military court on war crimes charges, one of which related to his command of ''Luftflotte'' IV during Operation Retribution.

They were the first Japanese people in the state of New York. Almost all of the 1,000 [[Issei]] in New York State by 1900 were in New York City.<ref name=RobertsonCreg/> The [[Chinese Exclusion Acts]] of 1882 restricted Japanese immigration to the United States and the United States and Japanese governments had a [[gentlemen's agreement]] where the Japanese would deny [[travel visa|visas]] to laborers wishing to immigrate to the United States in exchange for the U.S. not officially ending Japanese immigration. For those reasons, before the 1950s New York City had few Japanese immigrants. Japanese individuals of higher socioeconomic backgrounds did enter New York City during that period.<ref name=SmithNYCFoodp65>Smith, Andrew F. ''New York City: A Food Biography''.
