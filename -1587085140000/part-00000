It also is the first Pulsar to get Single Channel ABS as an option.\n\n===2015===\nIn April 2015, Bajaj launched the Pulsar RS200, AS150 and AS200 in which 'RS' stood for 'Race Sport' whereas 'AS' stood for 'Adventure Sport'. The RS200 is Bajaj's first attempt at a fully faired motorcycle whereas the AS series featured semi-fairing with projector headlamps common among them all. The AS200 got the same 199.5cc, single-cylinder, liquid-cooled engine that also powers the RS200 with the exception of fuel injection. Mated to a 6-speed transmission, this engine churns out a maximum power output of 23.17 PS at 9,500rpm along with a peak torque of 18.3 Nm at 8,000rpm. While the AS200 is based on the 200NS platform, the AS150 is built on a new perimeter frame instead of the standard Pulsar 150 Dtsi. The motorcycle derives its power from a 149.5cc, single-cylinder, air-cooled engine that, mated to a 5-speed gearbox, produces 16.8bhp at 9,000rpm and 13Nm at 7,500rpm. The RS200 makes slightly higher power output at 24.5PS that peaks out (compared to the AS200) at 9,750rpm and 18.6 Nm torque at 8000 rpm owing to its fuel injection.<ref>https://auto.ndtv.com/news/new-bajaj-pulsar-as200-and-as150-launched-in-india-754815</ref><ref>https://auto.ndtv.com/news/bajaj-launches-the-rs200-priced-at-rs-749729</ref>\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8_LSVN-PFU Pulsar AS200 ad]\n\n===2016 ===\nThe CS400 concept from the 2014 Auto Expo, went through a series or rebranding before release (Pulsar CS400, Pulsar VS400, Bajaj Kratos 400). Finally, it was separated from the Pulsar range and spawned as the Bajaj Dominar 400.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}\n\n=== 2017 ===\nThe 200NS, which was temporarily discontinued in favor of the AS200, was reintroduced as the NS200 with an updated color scheme. Later in the year, NS200 received a Single Channel ABS Variant.\n\nThe entire Pulsar lineup (135LS, 150, 180, 220F, NS200, RS200) receives [[Bharat Stage emission standards|BS4]] compliant engines and AHO (Always Headlamp On) as well as a new Laser Edge color scheme. The digital display on received newer graphics and a Blue back light instead of the previously Orange back light.  The Pulsar 150 received mechanical changes to conform to BS4 norms, leading to a loss of 1 Ps of power. The Pulsar 180 received a 230mm rear disc brake instead of a drum brake.\n\nA new model named the Pulsar NS160 was released soon after. It shared most of its styling and design with the NS200, but used a smaller 160cc Oil Cooled DTS-i engine producing 15.5 Ps of power at 8500 rpm and 14.6 Nm of peak torque at 6500 rpm. It also features a skinnier rear tire and does not offer a rear disc brake.\n\nThe NS200 and RS200 were rebadged and sold in the Malaysian market as the [[Modenas]] Pulsar NS200 and RS200.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}\nLater NS 160 was equipped with a 120/80 rear tyre and disc brakes\n\n==Technology==\n\n===DTSi===\nDTSi stands for Digital Twin [[Spark Ignition]], a Bajaj Auto trademark. Bajaj Auto holds an Indian patent for the DTSi technology. The Alfa Romeo Twin-Spark engines, the [[BMW F650 single|BMW F650 Funduro]] which was sold in India from 1995 to 1997 also had a twin-spark plug technology, and the Rotax motorcycle engines, more recently Honda's iDSI Vehicle engines use a similar arrangement of two spark-plugs. However very few small capacity engines did eventually implement such a scheme in their production prototypes.\n\n====Patent infringement====\n\nIn September 2007, Bajaj Auto filed a claim accusing that the development of [[TVS Flame]] was in violation of their patent for DTS-I.<ref>{{cite news|title=Patent row: Bajaj-TVS spat may end up in court|date=6 September 2007|url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/Patent_row_Bajaj-TVS_spat_may_end_up_in_court/articleshow/2341713.cms|publisher=Economic Times (India Times)|accessdate=2008-01-11}}</ref>\n[[TVS Motors]] decided to sue Bajaj Auto for libel.<ref>{{cite news|title=TVS takes lead in legal war with Bajaj|date=27 October 2007|publisher=Economic Times (India Times)|accessdate=2008-01-11|url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/News/News_By_Industry/Auto/Two-wheelers/TVS_takes_lead_in_legal_war_with_Bajaj/articleshow/2493910.cms}}\n</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Bajaj says to defend patent; TVS says will sue for libel|date=3 September 2007|work=Reuters|accessdate=2008-01-11|url=http://in.reuters.com/article/businessNews/idINIndia-29302820070903}}</ref>\nIn February 2008, the [[Madras High Court]] in Chennai restrained TVS from launching it with the twin spark plug technology.<ref>{{cite web |title=HC restrains TVS from launching Flame motorcycle |url=http://www.blonnet.com/2008/02/17/stories/2008021751350100.htm |access-date=1 November 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081202171410/http://www.blonnet.com/2008/02/17/stories/2008021751350100.htm |archive-date=2 December 2008 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\nTVS appealed against this decision, claiming that crucial evidence was not taken into account<ref>{{cite web|title=Patent dispute: TVS Motor goes on appeal|url=http://www.blonnet.com/2008/02/27/stories/2008022752430200.htm|access-date=1 November 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081010203659/http://www.blonnet.com/2008/02/27/stories/2008022752430200.htm|archive-date=10 October 2008|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\nand in March 2008, launched the Flame with a modified engine containing one spark plug.<ref>{{cite web |title=TVS Flame launched with modified engine |url=http://www.blonnet.com/2008/03/11/stories/2008031151070200.htm |access-date=1 November 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081216001102/http://www.blonnet.com/2008/03/11/stories/2008031151070200.htm |archive-date=16 December 2008 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The DTSi idea is a simple one to understand \u2013 it involved usage of two spark plugs (instead of one) per engine cylinder.

It also is the first Pulsar to get Single Channel ABS as an option. This is the most powerful pulsar yet.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}\n\n===2015===\nIn April 2015, Bajaj launched the Pulsar RS200, AS150 and AS200 in which 'RS' stood for 'Race Sport' whereas 'AS' stood for 'Adventure Sport'. The RS200 is Bajaj's first attempt at a fully faired motorcycle whereas the AS series featured semi-fairing with projector headlamps common among them all. The AS200 got the same 199.5cc, single-cylinder, liquid-cooled engine that also powers the RS200 with the exception of fuel injection. Mated to a 6-speed transmission, this engine churns out a maximum power output of 23.17 PS at 9,500rpm along with a peak torque of 18.3 Nm at 8,000rpm. While the AS200 is based on the 200NS platform, the AS150 is built on a new perimeter frame instead of the standard Pulsar 150 Dtsi. The motorcycle derives its power from a 149.5cc, single-cylinder, air-cooled engine that, mated to a 5-speed gearbox, produces 16.8bhp at 9,000rpm and 13Nm at 7,500rpm. The RS200 makes slightly higher power output at 24.5PS that peaks out (compared to the AS200) at 9,750rpm and 18.6 Nm torque at 8000 rpm owing to its fuel injection.<ref>https://auto.ndtv.com/news/new-bajaj-pulsar-as200-and-as150-launched-in-india-754815</ref><ref>https://auto.ndtv.com/news/bajaj-launches-the-rs200-priced-at-rs-749729</ref>\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8_LSVN-PFU Pulsar AS200 ad]\n\n===2016 ===\nThe CS400 concept from the 2014 Auto Expo, went through a series or rebranding before release (Pulsar CS400, Pulsar VS400, Bajaj Kratos 400). Finally, it was separated from the Pulsar range and spawned as the Bajaj Dominar 400.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}\n\n=== 2017 ===\nThe 200NS, which was temporarily discontinued in favor of the AS200, was reintroduced as the NS200 with an updated color scheme. Later in the year, NS200 received a Single Channel ABS Variant.\n\nThe entire Pulsar lineup (135LS, 150, 180, 220F, NS200, RS200) receives [[Bharat Stage emission standards|BS4]] compliant engines and AHO (Always Headlamp On) as well as a new Laser Edge color scheme. The digital display on received newer graphics and a Blue back light instead of the previously Orange back light.  The Pulsar 150 received mechanical changes to conform to BS4 norms, leading to a loss of 1 Ps of power. The Pulsar 180 received a 230mm rear disc brake instead of a drum brake.\n\nA new model named the Pulsar NS160 was released soon after. It shared most of its styling and design with the NS200, but used a smaller 160cc Oil Cooled DTS-i engine producing 15.5 Ps of power at 8500 rpm and 14.6 Nm of peak torque at 6500 rpm. It also features a skinnier rear tire and does not offer a rear disc brake.\n\nThe NS200 and RS200 were rebadged and sold in the Malaysian market as the [[Modenas]] Pulsar NS200 and RS200.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}\nLater NS 160 was equipped with a 120/80 rear tyre and disc brakes\n\n==Technology==\n\n===DTSi===\nDTSi stands for Digital Twin [[Spark Ignition]], a Bajaj Auto trademark. Bajaj Auto holds an Indian patent for the DTSi technology. The Alfa Romeo Twin-Spark engines, the [[BMW F650 single|BMW F650 Funduro]] which was sold in India from 1995 to 1997 also had a twin-spark plug technology, and the Rotax motorcycle engines, more recently Honda's iDSI Vehicle engines use a similar arrangement of two spark-plugs. However very few small capacity engines did eventually implement such a scheme in their production prototypes.\n\n====Patent infringement====\n\nIn September 2007, Bajaj Auto filed a claim accusing that the development of [[TVS Flame]] was in violation of their patent for DTS-I.<ref>{{cite news|title=Patent row: Bajaj-TVS spat may end up in court|date=6 September 2007|url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/Patent_row_Bajaj-TVS_spat_may_end_up_in_court/articleshow/2341713.cms|publisher=Economic Times (India Times)|accessdate=2008-01-11}}</ref>\n[[TVS Motors]] decided to sue Bajaj Auto for libel.<ref>{{cite news|title=TVS takes lead in legal war with Bajaj|date=27 October 2007|publisher=Economic Times (India Times)|accessdate=2008-01-11|url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/News/News_By_Industry/Auto/Two-wheelers/TVS_takes_lead_in_legal_war_with_Bajaj/articleshow/2493910.cms}}\n</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Bajaj says to defend patent; TVS says will sue for libel|date=3 September 2007|work=Reuters|accessdate=2008-01-11|url=http://in.reuters.com/article/businessNews/idINIndia-29302820070903}}</ref>\nIn February 2008, the [[Madras High Court]] in Chennai restrained TVS from launching it with the twin spark plug technology.<ref>{{cite web |title=HC restrains TVS from launching Flame motorcycle |url=http://www.blonnet.com/2008/02/17/stories/2008021751350100.htm |access-date=1 November 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081202171410/http://www.blonnet.com/2008/02/17/stories/2008021751350100.htm |archive-date=2 December 2008 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\nTVS appealed against this decision, claiming that crucial evidence was not taken into account<ref>{{cite web|title=Patent dispute: TVS Motor goes on appeal|url=http://www.blonnet.com/2008/02/27/stories/2008022752430200.htm|access-date=1 November 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081010203659/http://www.blonnet.com/2008/02/27/stories/2008022752430200.htm|archive-date=10 October 2008|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\nand in March 2008, launched the Flame with a modified engine containing one spark plug.<ref>{{cite web |title=TVS Flame launched with modified engine |url=http://www.blonnet.com/2008/03/11/stories/2008031151070200.htm |access-date=1 November 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081216001102/http://www.blonnet.com/2008/03/11/stories/2008031151070200.htm |archive-date=16 December 2008 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The DTSi idea is a simple one to understand \u2013 it involved usage of two spark plugs (instead of one) per engine cylinder.
