The family are introduced as a central family unit consisting of father [[Charlie Slater]] ([[Derek Martin]]), grandmother [[Mo Harris]] ([[Laila Morse]]), Charlie's daughters, [[Kat Slater]] ([[Jessie Wallace]]), [[Lynne Slater]] ([[Elaine Lordan]]), [[Little Mo Morgan]] ([[Kacey Ainsworth]]) and [[Zoe Slater]] ([[Michelle Ryan]]), and Lynne's partner [[Garry Hobbs]] ([[Ricky Groves]]). A fifth sister, [[Belinda Peacock]] ([[Leanne Lakey]]), was introduced a year later. The family were the eighth to be introduced in the soap's history, replacing the di Marco family who departed during the previous month. The Slaters were created by [[Tony Jordan]] and introduced by [[John Yorke (producer)|John Yorke]]. The Slater sisters were cast in an improvisation session. In their first years on the show, the family were involved in storylines about [[child sexual abuse]] and [[domestic violence]].\n\nFollowing multiple cast departures, three new cast members \u2014 [[Lacey Turner]] ([[Stacey Slater]]), [[Gillian Wright]] ([[Jean Slater]]) and [[Rob Kazinsky]] ([[Sean Slater]]) \u2014 joined the show as an extension of the family. Stacey and Jean were used to highlight the topic of [[bipolar disorder]], working with the charity [[Mind (charity)|Mind]]. In 2010, Turner left the series and Wallace reprised her role; the following year, Kat featured in a controversial story which sees her son swapped for a deceased baby. Turner returned in 2014 and the Slater family were later expanded. [[Riley Carter Millington]], the first transgender actor to portray a transgender character in a British soap opera, was cast as Stacey's half-brother, [[Kyle Slater]]. [[Denise Welch]] appeared in one episode as Kyle's mother, [[Alison Slater]].\n\nThe family became a focal point across New Year 2016 when Kat discovers that she has a secret son and Charlie is killed off. The events are followed by a spin-off drama, ''[[Kat & Alfie: Redwater]]'', focusing on Kat's search for her son, who is revealed to be murderous [[Catholic priest]] [[Dermott Dolan]] ([[Ois\u00edn Stack]]). 2016 also sees Stacey begin suffering from [[postpartum psychosis]], a rare mental illness associated with bipolar mothers. Prior to the storyline, the family were merged with the [[Fowler family]] following Stacey's pairing with [[Martin Fowler (EastEnders)|Martin Fowler]] ([[James Bye (actor)|James Bye]]). Following his reappointment, Yorke revived the Slater family by reintroducing Kat, Jean and Mo, and casting [[Katie Jarvis]] as new family member [[Hayley Slater]]. The Slater family once again became a focal point across Christmas 2018, when the paternity of Hayley\u2019s baby is revealed.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ok.co.uk/tv/eastenders/1531557/eastenders-christmas-day-boxing-day-spoilers-cast-jessie-wallace-kat-moon-alfie-hayley-slater-baby|title=EastEnders star reveals Christmas Day episode ends in CHAOS for the Slaters|last=Tutton|first=Charlotte|date=2018-12-24|website=OK!

Both Harry and Little Mo's abusive husband [[Trevor Morgan (EastEnders)|Trevor Morgan]] ([[Alex Ferns]]), introduced in December 2000, were outsiders to the core family unit, never given a permanent home on [[Albert Square]]. Yorke felt that this was an important distinction to make, as when the possibility of a child sexual abuse storyline was discussed, it was concluded that the audience would feel \"betrayed\" were such a revelation to be made about a long-established and well-liked character. Both characters were also easily removed from the family, with Trevor dying in a fire, and Harry exiled to Spain where he died from a heart attack.<ref>{{cite book |title=Media and violence: gendering the debates |last=Boyle |first=Karen |year=2005 |publisher=[[SAGE Publications|SAGE]] |isbn=1412903793 |pages=168\u20139 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VExX9_8ylggC&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_v2_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q=&f=false |accessdate=23 February 2010}}</ref>\n\n=== Departures and introductions ===\n[[File:Michelle Ryan at the BAFTA's.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Actress [[Michelle Ryan]] (''pictured in 2009'') departed her role as [[Zoe Slater]] in 2005.]]\nBetween July 2004 and May 2006, each original Slater sister departed the series.

The family are introduced as a central family unit consisting of father [[Charlie Slater]] ([[Derek Martin]]), grandmother [[Mo Harris]] ([[Laila Morse]]), Charlie's daughters, [[Kat Slater]] ([[Jessie Wallace]]), [[Lynne Slater]] ([[Elaine Lordan]]), [[Little Mo Morgan]] ([[Kacey Ainsworth]]) and [[Zoe Slater]] ([[Michelle Ryan]]), and Lynne's partner [[Garry Hobbs]] ([[Ricky Groves]]). A fifth sister, [[Belinda Peacock]] ([[Leanne Lakey]]), was introduced a year later. The family were the eighth to be introduced in the soap's history, replacing the di Marco family who departed during the previous month. The Slaters were created by [[Tony Jordan]] and introduced by [[John Yorke (producer)|John Yorke]]. The Slater sisters were cast in an improvisation session. In their first years on the show, the family were involved in storylines about [[child sexual abuse]] and [[domestic violence]].\n\nFollowing multiple cast departures, three new cast members \u2014 [[Lacey Turner]] ([[Stacey Slater]]), [[Gillian Wright]] ([[Jean Slater]]) and [[Rob Kazinsky]] ([[Sean Slater]]) \u2014 joined the show as an extension of the family. Stacey and Jean were used to highlight the topic of [[bipolar disorder]], working with the charity [[Mind (charity)|Mind]]. In 2010, Turner left the series and Wallace reprised her role; the following year, Kat featured in a controversial story which sees her son swapped for a deceased baby. Turner returned in 2014 and the Slater family were later expanded. [[Riley Carter Millington]], the first transgender actor to portray a transgender character in a British soap opera, was cast as Stacey's half-brother, [[Kyle Slater]]. [[Denise Welch]] appeared in one episode as Kyle's mother, [[Alison Slater]].\n\nThe family became a focal point across New Year 2016 when Kat discovers that she has a secret son and Charlie is killed off. The events are followed by a spin-off drama, ''[[Kat & Alfie: Redwater]]'', focusing on Kat's search for her son, who is revealed to be murderous [[Catholic priest]] [[Dermott Dolan]] ([[Ois\u00edn Stack]]). 2016 also sees Stacey begin suffering from [[postpartum psychosis]], a rare mental illness associated with bipolar mothers. Prior to the storyline, the family were merged with the [[Fowler family]] following Stacey's pairing with [[Martin Fowler (EastEnders)|Martin Fowler]] ([[James Bye (actor)|James Bye]]). Following his reappointment, Yorke revived the Slater family by reintroducing Kat, Jean and Mo, and casting [[Katie Jarvis]] as new family member [[Hayley Slater]]. The Slater family once again became a focal point across Christmas 2018, when the paternity of Hayley\u2019s baby is revealed.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ok.co.uk/tv/eastenders/1531557/eastenders-christmas-day-boxing-day-spoilers-cast-jessie-wallace-kat-moon-alfie-hayley-slater-baby|title=EastEnders star reveals Christmas Day episode ends in CHAOS for the Slaters|last=Tutton|first=Charlotte|date=2018-12-24|website=OK!

Both Harry and Little Mo's abusive husband [[Trevor Morgan (EastEnders)|Trevor Morgan]] ([[Alex Ferns]]), introduced in December 2000, were outsiders to the core family unit, never given a permanent home on [[Albert Square]]. Yorke felt that this was an important distinction to make, as when the possibility of a child sexual abuse storyline was discussed, it was concluded that the audience would feel \"betrayed\" were such a revelation to be made about a long-established and well-liked character. Both characters were also easily removed from the family, with Trevor dying in a fire, and Harry exiled to Spain where he died from a heart attack.<ref>{{cite book |title=Media and violence: gendering the debates |last=Boyle |first=Karen |year=2005 |publisher=[[SAGE Publications|SAGE]] |isbn=1412903793 |pages=168\u20139 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VExX9_8ylggC&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_v2_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q=&f=false |accessdate=23 February 2010}}</ref>\n\n=== Departures and introductions ===\n[[File:Michelle Ryan at the BAFTA's.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Actress [[Michelle Ryan]] (''pictured in 2009'') departed her role as [[Zoe Slater]] in 2005.]]\nBetween July 2004 and May 2006, each original Slater sister departed the series.

She causes trouble through her promiscuous and immoral behaviour, and is sent back home to Jean. However, she then returns to the Slaters, eventually beginning to settle down when joined by her mother and older brother, Sean. It is revealed that Stacey had a troubled childhood, due to Jean's [[bipolar disorder]] and the death of her father when she was 11, after which Sean abandoned the family and left Stacey as Jean's sole carer. In 2005, Stacey befriends [[Ruby Allen]] ([[Louisa Lytton]]) and they later become best friends, despite falling out a few times. Their friendship ends completely in 2006, when Ruby encourages Sean to move away from his family and Walford for good, upsetting Stacey and Jean. Stacey also becomes heavily involved in the murder of [[Den Watts]] ([[Leslie Grantham]]) when she gives her cousin [[Zoe Slater]] ([[Michelle Ryan]]) a false alibi for his murder, landing an innocent [[Sam Mitchell (EastEnders)|Sam Mitchell]] ([[Kim Medcalf]]) in prison. Sam's family and Den's adoptive daughter [[Sharon Watts]] ([[Letitia Dean]]) pressure her into telling the truth, and eventually Den's wife [[Chrissie Watts]] ([[Tracy Ann Oberman]]) is arrested for the murder.\n\nDespite being unimpressed by Walford newcomer [[Bradley Branning]] ([[Charlie Clements]]), the pair grow to love one another but the relationship deteriorates when Stacey discovers she has been impregnated by Bradley. When he uncovers the truth, Bradley constantly urges Stacey to have an abortion. After hours of pleading with Bradley, she finally gives up and after doing so, their romance sours. Bradley calls time on his relationship with Stacey when she embarrasses him at a work party. She confides in his father [[Max Branning]] ([[Jake Wood]]) and they end up having sex. Subsequently, they begin an affair and Max agrees to divorce his wife, [[Tanya Branning]] ([[Jo Joyner]]). However, he has this on a halt as he learns that Tanya is pregnant with their son. He leaves Stacey and she reunites with Bradley, later marrying. Max propositions Stacey after the wedding ceremony and their brief kiss is recorded on Max's eldest daughter [[Lauren Branning|Lauren]]'s ([[Madeline Duggan]]) hidden video camera. Lauren gives a DVD of the recording to Bradley as a Christmas present, revealing the fling as he plays it to the family. Devastated, Tanya slaps Stacey and Bradley ends their marriage again for six months. He eventually decides to give their marriage another chance, suggesting that they start a family. Stacey is uncertain and secretly continues having birth control pills. She seduces [[Callum Monks]] ([[Elliott Jordan]]). She immediately regrets cheating on Bradley. Although she attempts to reignite the spark in her marriage, Stacey divorces Bradley. She has a [[one-night stand]] with Callum, which leads to them dating. They split, however, over his harsh treatment of her mother.\n\nFollowing the death of her friend [[Danielle Jones (EastEnders)|Danielle Jones]] ([[Lauren Crace]]), Stacey begins behaving erratically. She steals money from her family, sleeps with various men on the go and becomes a heavy drinker. She is diagnosed with bipolar disorder, but is non-compliant with her medication and becomes paranoid, experiencing hallucinations. Stacey starts sleeping with [[Ryan Malloy]] ([[Neil McDermott]]) and is raped by [[Archie Mitchell]] ([[Larry Lamb]]). She believes that they are both planning to kill her. After attacking Archie with a broken glass and accusing her friends and family of planning to hurt her, Stacey is [[Involuntary commitment|involuntarily committed]] to hospital, where she befriends [[Becca Swanson (EastEnders)|Becca Swanson]] ([[Simone James]]).\n\nUpon her release, Bradley confesses his feelings for Stacey and they reconcile. Then Stacey discovers she is 3 months pregnant, so Bradley could not be the father. She tells Bradley that Archie raped her and must be the father. Archie is murdered that night by an unknown assailant. Stacey and Bradley agree to pretend the baby is theirs, and remarry on 18 February 2010. A jealous Becca reveals the rape to Archie's eldest daughter [[Ronnie Mitchell]] ([[Samantha Womack]]), who tells Stacey that Archie was infertile following cancer treatment. Becca informs the police that Bradley had a motive to kill Archie. He and Stacey attempt to flee Walford, but Bradley is caught by the police and falls to his death while trying to escape. A distraught Stacey confesses to Max that she killed Archie while her world falls apart.\n\nStacey decides not to tell Ryan that he must be the father of her baby. He exhibits a romantic interest in her, which is later revealed to be part of a bet with his girlfriend [[Janine Butcher]] ([[Charlie Brooks]]). Upset by this revelation, Stacey's waters break. Ryan stays with her as she gives birth to a daughter, whom she names [[Lily Branning|Lily]]. When Ryan later rescues them from a fire at [[The Queen Victoria]] pub, Stacey admits that he is Lily's father. Ryan initially refuses to act as a parent to her, but bonds with her when Stacey and a jealous Janine are arrested for fighting during a night out. Janine's jealousy escalates to kidnapping Lily, but Ryan convinces her to return her. Stacey and Ryan grow closer, spending time together, and they passionately kiss. During this time, Lauren (now [[Jacqueline Jossa]]) discovers Stacey's guilt in Archie's murder and records a confession on her phone. Stacey attempts to flee to [[Palma de Mallorca|Palma, Majorca]], but Ryan stops her, telling her he has feelings for her and wants to date her. They start an affair, but, unbeknownst to them, Janine finds out and poisons Ryan in revenge. Ryan is hospitalised and on his return, he convinces Janine he loves her but publicly declares his love for Stacey in The Queen Vic. Janine walks in as they are in a passionate embrace. She concedes defeat until Lauren, who still believes Max is emotionally involved with Stacey, gives Janine the recorded confession. The next day, Janine attempts to play the recording in front of customers in The Queen Vic, but it has been recorded over because Lauren warned Max. Janine says that Stacey killed Archie but no one believes her. Stacey leaves the pub in tears, followed by Ryan. She then breaks down and tells Ryan that Janine said the truth.\n\nThe next day, Christmas Day, Stacey tells Jean she killed Archie, so Jean takes Lily away from her. Ryan convinces Stacey to leave with him as Janine will call the police. Stacey lets Janine in and she attempts to set Stacey up by grabbing a knife, placing it into Stacey's hand and stabbing herself. Stacey runs out of the house and Janine convinces Jean to call the police. Stacey contemplates suicide but Max stops her and says he will help her to escape. Stacey convinces Jean that Janine has framed her. Ryan plans to run away with Stacey, but Stacey states that events have happened rapidly, and she is not sure whether she loves him.

Prior to this, Stacey had told Bradley that Archie raped her when she was suffering from bipolar disorder and she was pregnant with his child. A [[EastEnders Live|live episode]] broadcast on 19 February 2010 revealed Stacey as the killer, moments after Bradley fell to his death after becoming the prime suspect. Following this, a [[list of EastEnders two-hander episodes|two-hander episode]] was announced for Stacey and Max, who became the only person to know Stacey was the killer. Santer promised \"fascinating\" stories for Stacey and Max, saying that the two-hander will explore Stacey's motives for killing Archie, and will be a test for Max as the murder led to his son's death. Santer explained that the murder was not a function of Stacey's bipolar disorder as she was lucid at the time, and she had several sound reasons to be angry with him \u2013 he took advantage of her, ruined her second chance with Bradley, caused a chain of events leading to the death of Stacey's best friend Danielle and drove her brother Sean out of Walford.

When he uncovers the truth, Bradley constantly urges Stacey to have an abortion. After hours of pleading with Bradley, she finally gives up and after doing so, their romance sours. Bradley calls time on his relationship with Stacey when she embarrasses him at a work party. She confides in his father [[Max Branning]] ([[Jake Wood]]) and they end up having sex.

Archie is murdered that night by an unknown assailant. Stacey and Bradley agree to pretend the baby is theirs, and remarry on 18 February 2010. A jealous Becca reveals the rape to Archie's eldest daughter [[Ronnie Mitchell]] ([[Samantha Womack]]), who tells Stacey that Archie was infertile following cancer treatment. Becca informs the police that Bradley had a motive to kill Archie. He and Stacey attempt to flee Walford, but Bradley is caught by the police and falls to his death while trying to escape.

The next day, Janine attempts to play the recording in front of customers in The Queen Vic, but it has been recorded over because Lauren warned Max. Janine says that Stacey killed Archie but no one believes her. Stacey leaves the pub in tears, followed by Ryan. She then breaks down and tells Ryan that Janine said the truth.\n\nThe next day, Christmas Day, Stacey tells Jean she killed Archie, so Jean takes Lily away from her.

Kat later tells Luke \"Jenny\" is really Stacey so he ends the relationship. Stacey and Lily spend the night at Kat and Alfie's house and the following day, Kat visits Janine in prison to ask her to withdraw the statement she made accusing Stacey of stabbing her. Janine agrees so Stacey returns to Albert Square. Luke visits Stacey, but leaves, after discovering that she killed Archie. After listening to what Luke said, Stacey decides to clear Bradley's name and calls the police, telling them that she killed Archie. She is arrested and later sentenced to five years in prison.

When Kush confronts her, she tells him that she thinks he could be the father. Kush's mother [[Carmel Kazemi]] ([[Bonnie Langford]]) notices Kush and Stacey talking, and realises that he could be the father of Stacey's baby.

When Stacey later attends a church service and prays for her father, she sees Kyle, who then leaves suddenly without telling her who he is, causing her to become more suspicious.\n\nStacey tells Martin she has a stalker, and when Jean and Ollie visit, she tells them too. Stacey realises that Jean knows who it is, and when she asks, Jean produces the key. Jean reveals the key is for Brian's safety deposit box in a bank.

Whilst picking up the children from school, Stacey discovers that [[Amy Mitchell]] (Abbie Burke) is missing and unbeknownst to her, Sean has picked Amy up and returns her to Walford. Stacey confronts Sean at the pub and Sean is angry at Stacey for not telling him about Roxy's death. Sean goes missing and Stacey and Jean manage to trace him at a barn at the point of suicide. Sean reveals that he killed their father during an argument, but Stacey and Jean forgive him and manage to talk him out of suicide. Stacey falls out with Kat after she doesn't tell her about Kush's plans to go for joint custody of Arthur and disowns her as family, stealing \u00a350,000 from Kat which belongs to [[Phil Mitchell]] ([[Steve McFadden]]), however she gives the money back after Phil threatens the family. A few weeks later Stacey spends a night at Max's house after seeing him drunk and finds out that he is self harming, her friendship with Ruby then becomes strained after she starts a relationship with Max. After an argument with Martin, Stacey admits to him that she is jealous of Max and Ruby and so he walks out of the Queen Vic from her. Later on Kat and Martin get into a fight with Phil in his garage, leading to Phil attempting to strangle Martin. He is then hit over the head with a wrench, and it is revealed that Stacey is the culprit, as she did it to save Martin. He is left at the bottom of the pit, seemingly 'dead', fighting for his life. Stacey and Martin flee Walford with Lily and Hope to go on the run to evade potential  arrest leaving behind Arthur who stays with Kush.\n\nMartin returns to Walford when Bex attempts suicide. He encounters Ben, who blackmails him into performing illegal activity for him in exchange for Stacey's safety. When Ben threatens to kill Stacey and their children, Martin visits her and ends their marriage, lying that he has had sex with Sonia and wants to be in a relationship with her, devastating Stacey. When Ben relieves Martin of his illegal duties and retracts his threat to hurt Stacey and the children, Martin tries to contact Stacey to no avail. A man, [[List of EastEnders characters (2019)#Jerome|Jerome]] (Chris Charles), then arrives at the Slater household to collect the belongings of Stacey and the children, which Martin contests. Martin later receives divorce papers, on the grounds of adultery, from Stacey's lawyer.\n\n==Creation==\n[[File:Stace 2004.jpg|right|thumb|150px|Stacey Slater as she appeared in 2004]]\nIn September 2004, an official BBC press release announced an addition to the popular [[Slater family (EastEnders)|Slater family]]; the new \"feisty female\" named Stacey Slater, [[Charlie Slater]]'s teenage great-niece and second cousin to [[Kat Slater|Kat]], [[Lynne Hobbs|Lynne]], [[Belinda Peacock|Belinda]] and [[Little Mo Mitchell|Little Mo]], and third cousin to [[Zoe Slater|Zoe]].

I've watched the show since I was about four years old, and I used to live in a house that backed onto the ''EastEnders'' set so I used to watch them filming all the time.

Addressed in a storyline that aired in December 2005, Stacey returned to live with her \"disturbed\" mother [[Jean Slater|Jean]], played by [[Gillian Wright]], during one of her breakdowns. Jean, who had \"sank into the dark despair of her illness\", was living in squalor, off her medication, starved, [[suicide|suicidal]], and being abused and ridiculed by her neighbours.

Prior to this, Stacey had told Bradley that Archie raped her when she was suffering from bipolar disorder and she was pregnant with his child. A [[EastEnders Live|live episode]] broadcast on 19 February 2010 revealed Stacey as the killer, moments after Bradley fell to his death after becoming the prime suspect. Following this, a [[list of EastEnders two-hander episodes|two-hander episode]] was announced for Stacey and Max, who became the only person to know Stacey was the killer. Santer promised \"fascinating\" stories for Stacey and Max, saying that the two-hander will explore Stacey's motives for killing Archie, and will be a test for Max as the murder led to his son's death. Santer explained that the murder was not a function of Stacey's bipolar disorder as she was lucid at the time, and she had several sound reasons to be angry with him \u2013 he took advantage of her, ruined her second chance with Bradley, caused a chain of events leading to the death of Stacey's best friend Danielle and drove her brother Sean out of Walford.

The episode of Phil's attack aired on 30 July, and Stacey was revealed as his attacker after hitting him over the head with a wrench during a fight between Phil, Martin and Kat. She departed in the episode broadcast on 2 August 2019. A few weeks later it emerged Turner was back filming with the serial just a month after giving birth; Stacey appeared in an episode on 28 October, after a voice cameo on 7 October and another on 11 October with a third on 17 October.

[...] Granted, the 21-year-old shoulders a fair whack of the programme, but this material is pushing her acting abilities to unseen levels. Lacey's one of the BBC soap's finest actresses and to be handed a story with scenes as powerful as those in last Tuesday's episode must be nothing short of a privilege.
