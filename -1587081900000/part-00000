[[blurred vision|blurred]] or [[vision loss|no vision]] in the center of the [[visual field]].<ref name=NEI2015/> Early on there are often no symptoms.<ref name=NEI2015/> Over time, however, some people experience a gradual worsening of vision that may affect one or both eyes.<ref name=NEI2015/> While it does not result in complete [[blindness]], loss of central vision can make it hard to

name=NEI2015/>\n\n<!-- Cause and diagnosis-->\nMacular degeneration typically occurs in older people.<ref name=NEI2015/> Genetic factors and smoking also play a role.<ref name=NEI2015/> It is due to damage to the [[macula of retina|macula]] of the [[retina]].<ref name=NEI2015/> Diagnosis is by a complete [[eye exam]].<ref name=NEI2015/> The severity is divided into early, intermediate, and late

symptoms of macular degeneration include:\n;'''Visual symptoms'''\n* [[Distorted vision]] in the form of [[metamorphopsia]], in which a grid of straight lines appears wavy and parts of the grid may appear blank: Patients often first notice this when looking at things like miniblinds in their home or telephone poles while driving. There may also be central [[scotoma]]s, shadows or missing areas of vision\n* Slow recovery of visual function after exposure to bright light (photostress test)\n* Visual acuity drastically decreasing (two levels or more), e.g.: 20/20 to 20/80\n* Blurred vision: Those with nonexudative macular degeneration may be asymptomatic or notice a gradual loss of central vision, whereas those with exudative macular degeneration often notice a rapid onset of vision loss (often caused by leakage and bleeding of abnormal blood vessels).\n* Trouble discerning colors, specifically dark ones from dark ones and light ones from light ones\n* A loss in [[Contrast (vision)|contrast sensitivity]]\n*Formed visual hallucinations and flashing lights have also been associated with severe visual loss secondary to wet AMD <ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.aao.org/preferred-practice-pattern/age-related-macular-degeneration-ppp-2015|title=Age-Related Macular Degeneration PPP - Updated 2015|date=2015-01-29|work=American Academy of Ophthalmology|access-date=2018-11-13}}</ref>\n\nMacular degeneration by itself will not lead to total blindness. For that matter, only a small number of people with visual impairment are totally blind. In almost all cases, some vision remains, mainly peripheral. Other complicating conditions may lead to such an acute condition (severe stroke or trauma, untreated glaucoma, etc.), but few macular degeneration patients experience total visual loss.<ref>{{cite journal |first=DL |last=Roberts |date=September 2006 |title=The First Year \u2013 Age Related Macular Degeneration |journal=Marlowe & Company |page=100}}</ref>\n\nThe area of the macula comprises only about 2.1% of the retina, and the remaining 97.9% (the peripheral field) remains unaffected by the disease. Even though the macula provides such a small fraction of the visual field, almost half of the visual cortex is devoted to processing macular information.<ref>{{cite journal |first=DL |last=Roberts |date=September 2006 |title=The First Year \u2013 Age Related Macular Degeneration |journal=Marlowe & Company |page=20}}</ref>\n\nThe loss of central vision profoundly affects visual functioning. It is quite difficult, for example, to read without central vision. Pictures that attempt to depict the central visual loss of macular degeneration with a black spot do not do justice to the devastating nature of the visual loss. This can be demonstrated by printing letters six inches high on a piece of paper and attempting to identify them while looking straight ahead and holding the paper slightly to the side. Most people find this difficult to do.\n\nIn addition, people with dry macular degeneration often do not experience any symptoms but can experience gradual onset of blurry vision in one or both eyes.<ref name=\"Cunningham_2017\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Cunningham J | title = Recognizing age-related macular degeneration in primary care | journal = JAAPA  | volume = 30 | issue = 3 | pages = 18\u201322 | date = March 2017 | pmid = 28151737 | doi = 10.1097/01.jaa.0000512227.85313.05 }}</ref><ref name=\"Lim_2012\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Lim LS, Mitchell P, Seddon JM, Holz FG, Wong TY | title = Age-related macular degeneration | journal = [[The Lancet]] | volume = 379 | issue = 9827 | pages = 1728\u201338 | date = May 2012 | pmid = 22559899 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(12)60282-7 }}</ref> People with wet macular degeneration may experience acute onset of visual symptoms.<ref name=\"Cunningham_2017\" /><ref name=\"Lim_2012\" />\n\n==Risk factors==\n* '''Aging''': Advanced age is the strongest predictor of AMD, particularly over 50.<ref name=\"pmid21609220\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Deangelis MM, Silveira AC, Carr EA, Kim IK | title = Genetics of age-related macular degeneration: current concepts, future directions | journal = Seminars in Ophthalmology | volume = 26 | issue = 3 | pages = 77\u201393 | date = May 2011 | pmid = 21609220 | pmc = 4242505 | doi = 10.3109/08820538.2011.577129 }}</ref>\n* '''Family history:'''\n\n===Environment and lifestyle===\n*Smoking: Smoking tobacco increases the risk of AMD by two to three times that of someone who has never smoked, and may be the most important modifiable factor in its prevention.

Incipient atrophy is demarcated by areas of [[retinal pigment epithelium]] (RPE) thinning or depigmentation that precede geographic atrophy in the early stages of AMD. In advanced stages of AMD, atrophy of the RPE (geographic atrophy) and/or development of new blood vessels (neovascularization) result in the death of photoreceptors and central vision loss.\n\nIn the dry ([[Exudate|nonexudative]]) form, cellular debris called [[drusen]] accumulates between the retina and the [[choroid]], causing atrophy and scarring to the retina.

Most people with these early changes (referred to as age-related maculopathy) still have good vision. People with drusen may or may not develop AMD. In fact, the majority of people over age 60 have drusen with no adverse effects. The risk of developing symptoms is higher when the drusen are large and numerous, and associated with the disturbance in the pigmented cell layer under the macula. Large and soft drusen are thought to be related to elevated [[cholesterol]] deposits.\n\n====Early AMD====\nEarly AMD is diagnosed based on the presence of medium-sized drusen, about the width of an average human hair. Early AMD is usually asymptomatic.<ref name=\"NEI2015\"/>\n\n====Intermediate AMD====\nIntermediate AMD is diagnosed by large drusen and/or any retinal pigment abnormalities.

The damage can either be the development of atrophy or the onset of neovascular disease. Late AMD is further divided into two subtypes based on the types of damage: Geographic atrophy and Wet AMD (also called Neovascular AMD).<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/><ref name=\"NEI2015\"/>\n\n=====Dry AMD=====\nDry AMD (also called nonexudative AMD) is a broad designation, encompassing all forms of AMD that are not neovascular (wet AMD).  This includes early and intermediate forms of AMD, as well as the advanced form of dry AMD known as geographic atrophy.  Dry AMD patients tend to have minimal symptoms in the earlier stages; visual function loss occurs more often if the condition advances to geographic atrophy. Dry AMD accounts for 80\u201390% of cases and tends to progress slowly. In 10\u201320% of people, dry AMD progresses to the wet type.\n\n====Geographic atrophy====\n[[Geographic atrophy]] (also called atrophic AMD) is an advanced form of AMD in which progressive and irreversible loss of retinal cells leads to a loss of visual function. There are multiple layers that make up the retina, and in geographic atrophy, there are three specific layers that undergo atrophy: the choriocapillaris, retinal pigment epithelium, and the overlying photoreceptors. \n\nThe three layers that undergo atrophy in geographic atrophy are all adjacent to each other. The photoreceptors are the most superficial and they are the cells that are responsible for converting energy from the light from the outside world, into an electrical signal to be sent to the brain. There are several functions of the retinal pigment epithelium. One of the main functions of the retinal pigment epithelium is to minimize oxidative stress. It does so by absorbing light, and thus preventing it from getting to the underlying layers. The layers underlying the retinal pigment epithelium are very vascularlized so they have very high oxygen tension. Thus, if light was to get to those layers, many free radicals would form and cause damage to nearby tissues. The deepest layer that undergoes atrophy in geographic atrophy is called the choriocappilaris. It is a capillary network that provides nutrients to the retinal pigment epithelium. \n\nThe pathophysiology of geographic atrophy is still uncertain. Some studies questioned whether it was due to a deficient retinal pigment epithelium, leading to increased oxidative stress.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=X.

It is usually, but not always, preceded by the dry form of AMD. The proliferation of abnormal blood vessels in the retina is stimulated by [[vascular endothelial growth factor]] (VEGF). Because these blood vessels are abnormal, these are also more fragile than typical blood vessels, which ultimately leads to blood and protein leakage below the macula.

appear blank: Patients often first notice this when looking at things like miniblinds in their home or telephone poles while driving. There may also be central [[scotoma]]s, shadows or missing areas of vision\n* Slow recovery of visual function after exposure to bright light (photostress test)\n* Visual acuity drastically decreasing (two levels or more), e.g.: 20/20 to 20/80\n* Blurred vision: Those with nonexudative macular degeneration may be asymptomatic or notice a gradual loss of central vision, whereas those with exudative macular degeneration often notice a rapid onset of vision loss (often caused by leakage and bleeding of abnormal blood vessels).\n* Trouble discerning colors, specifically dark ones from dark ones and light ones from light ones\n* A loss in [[Contrast (vision)|contrast sensitivity]]\n*Formed visual hallucinations and flashing lights have also been associated with severe visual loss secondary to wet AMD <ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.aao.org/preferred-practice-pattern/age-related-macular-degeneration-ppp-2015|title=Age-Related Macular Degeneration PPP - Updated 2015|date=2015-01-29|work=American Academy of Ophthalmology|access-date=2018-11-13}}</ref>\n\nMacular degeneration by itself will not lead to total blindness. For that matter, only a small number of people with visual impairment are totally blind. In almost all cases, some vision remains, mainly peripheral. Other complicating conditions may lead to such an acute condition (severe stroke or trauma, untreated glaucoma, etc.), but few macular degeneration patients experience total visual loss.<ref>{{cite journal |first=DL |last=Roberts |date=September 2006 |title=The First Year \u2013 Age Related Macular Degeneration |journal=Marlowe & Company |page=100}}</ref>\n\nThe area of the macula comprises only about 2.1% of the retina, and the remaining 97.9% (the peripheral field) remains unaffected by the disease. Even though the macula provides such a small fraction of the visual field, almost half of the visual cortex is devoted to processing macular information.<ref>{{cite journal |first=DL |last=Roberts |date=September 2006 |title=The First Year \u2013 Age Related Macular Degeneration |journal=Marlowe & Company |page=20}}</ref>\n\nThe loss of central vision profoundly affects visual functioning. It is quite difficult, for example, to read without central vision. Pictures that attempt to depict the central visual loss of macular degeneration with a black spot do not do justice to the devastating nature of the visual loss. This can be demonstrated by printing letters six inches high on a piece of paper and attempting to identify them while looking straight ahead and holding the paper slightly to the side.

Incipient atrophy is demarcated by areas of [[retinal pigment epithelium]] (RPE) thinning or depigmentation that precede geographic atrophy in the early stages of AMD. In advanced stages of AMD, atrophy of the RPE (geographic atrophy) and/or development of new blood vessels (neovascularization) result in the death of photoreceptors and central vision loss.\n\nIn the dry ([[Exudate|nonexudative]]) form, cellular debris called [[drusen]] accumulates between the retina and the [[choroid]], causing atrophy and scarring to the retina.

Most people with these early changes (referred to as age-related maculopathy) still have good vision. People with drusen may or may not develop AMD. In fact, the majority of people over age 60 have drusen with no adverse effects. The risk of developing symptoms is higher when the drusen are large and numerous, and associated with the disturbance in the pigmented cell layer under the macula. Large and soft drusen are thought to be related to elevated [[cholesterol]] deposits.\n\n====Early AMD====\nEarly AMD is diagnosed based on the presence of medium-sized drusen, about the width of an average human hair. Early AMD is usually asymptomatic.<ref name=\"NEI2015\"/>\n\n====Intermediate AMD====\nIntermediate AMD is diagnosed by large drusen and/or any retinal pigment abnormalities.

The damage can either be the development of atrophy or the onset of neovascular disease. Late AMD is further divided into two subtypes based on the types of damage: Geographic atrophy and Wet AMD (also called Neovascular AMD).<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/><ref name=\"NEI2015\"/>\n\n=====Dry AMD=====\nDry AMD (also called nonexudative AMD) is a broad designation, encompassing all forms of AMD that are not neovascular (wet AMD).  This includes early and intermediate forms of AMD, as well as the advanced form of dry AMD known as geographic atrophy.  Dry AMD patients tend to have minimal symptoms in the earlier stages; visual function loss occurs more often if the condition advances to geographic atrophy. Dry AMD accounts for 80\u201390% of cases and tends to progress slowly. In 10\u201320% of people, dry AMD progresses to the wet type.\n\n====Geographic atrophy====\n[[Geographic atrophy]] (also called atrophic AMD) is an advanced form of AMD in which progressive and irreversible loss of retinal cells leads to a loss of visual function. There are multiple layers that make up the retina, and in geographic atrophy, there are three specific layers that undergo atrophy: the choriocapillaris, retinal pigment epithelium, and the overlying photoreceptors. \n\nThe three layers that undergo atrophy in geographic atrophy are all adjacent to each other. The photoreceptors are the most superficial and they are the cells that are responsible for converting energy from the light from the outside world, into an electrical signal to be sent to the brain. There are several functions of the retinal pigment epithelium. One of the main functions of the retinal pigment epithelium is to minimize oxidative stress. It does so by absorbing light, and thus preventing it from getting to the underlying layers. The layers underlying the retinal pigment epithelium are very vascularlized so they have very high oxygen tension. Thus, if light was to get to those layers, many free radicals would form and cause damage to nearby tissues. The deepest layer that undergoes atrophy in geographic atrophy is called the choriocappilaris. It is a capillary network that provides nutrients to the retinal pigment epithelium. \n\nThe pathophysiology of geographic atrophy is still uncertain. Some studies questioned whether it was due to a deficient retinal pigment epithelium, leading to increased oxidative stress.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=X.

It is usually, but not always, preceded by the dry form of AMD. The proliferation of abnormal blood vessels in the retina is stimulated by [[vascular endothelial growth factor]] (VEGF). Because these blood vessels are abnormal, these are also more fragile than typical blood vessels, which ultimately leads to blood and protein leakage below the macula.

The former princely state became part of the new Indian state of [[Vindhya Pradesh]], and most of the territory of the former state, including the town of Ajaigarh, became part of Panna District, with a smaller portion going to [[Chhatarpur District]].

This grand fort is noted for its rich historical past and architectural beauty, which speaks volumes about the Chandela dynasty.\n\nThere is plenty to explore at the fort, which makes it a treat for history and art lovers. Reminiscent of old times, this fort has two gates (earlier there were five), two temples and two rock-cut tanks, close to the northern gate.

The Visigoths emerged from earlier Gothic groups, including a large group of [[Thervingi]], who had moved into the Roman Empire beginning in 376 and had played a major role in defeating the Romans at the [[Battle of Adrianople]] in 378.{{sfn|Heather|1998|pp=52\u201357, 300\u2013301}} Relations between the Romans and the Visigoths were variable, alternately warring with one another and making treaties when convenient.{{sfn|Waldman|Mason|2006|p=843}} Under their first leader [[Alaric I]] they invaded Italy and [[sack of Rome (410)|sacked Rome in 410]]. Afterwards, they began settling down, first in southern [[Gaul]] and eventually in [[Hispania]], where they founded the [[Visigothic Kingdom]] and maintained a presence from the 5th to the 8th centuries AD.{{sfn|Waldman|Mason|2006|pp=843\u2013844}}\n\nThe Visigoths first settled in southern Gaul as ''[[foederati]]'' to the Romans, a relationship established in 418. However, they soon fell out with their Roman hosts (for reasons that are now obscure) and established their own kingdom with its [[Capital city|capital]] at [[Toulouse]]. They next extended their authority into [[Hispania]] at the expense of the [[Suebi]] and [[Vandals]]. In 507, however, their rule in Gaul was ended by the [[Franks]] under [[Clovis I]], who defeated them in the [[Battle of Vouill\u00e9]]. After that, the Visigoth kingdom was limited to [[Hispania]], and they never again held territory north of the [[Pyrenees]] other than [[Septimania]]. A small, elite group of Visigoths came to dominate the governance of that region at the expense of those who had previously ruled there, particularly in the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] province of [[Spania]] and the [[Kingdom of the Suebi]].\n\nIn or around 589, the Visigoths under [[Reccared I]] converted from [[Arianism]] to [[Nicene Christianity]], gradually adopting the culture of their Hispano-Roman subjects.{{sfn|Claude|1998|pp=119\u2013120}} Their legal code, the ''[[Visigothic Code]]'' (completed in 654) abolished the longstanding practice of applying different laws for Romans and Visigoths. Once legal distinctions were no longer being made between ''Romani'' and ''Gothi'', they became known collectively as ''Hispani''. In the century that followed, the region was dominated by the [[Councils of Toledo]] and the episcopacy. Little else is known about the Visigoths history during the 7th century, since records are relatively sparse. In 711 or 712, an [[Umayyad conquest of Hispania|invading force of Arabs and Berbers]] defeated the Visigoths in the [[Battle of Guadalete]]. Their king, [[Roderic]], and many members of their governing elite were killed, and their kingdom rapidly collapsed. \n\nDuring their governance of [[Hispania]], the Visigoths [[Visigothic art and architecture|built several churches]] that survive. They also left many artifacts, which have been discovered in increasing numbers by archaeologists in recent times. The [[Treasure of Guarrazar]] of [[votive crown]]s and crosses is the most spectacular. They founded the only new cities in western Europe from the fall of the Western half of the Roman Empire until the rise of the [[Carolingian dynasty]]. Many Visigothic names are still in use in modern [[List of Spanish words of Germanic origin#Names|Spanish]] and [[List of Portuguese words of Germanic origin#Names|Portuguese]]. Their most notable legacy, however, was the ''[[Visigothic Code]]'', which served, among other things, as the basis for court procedure in most of Christian [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberia]] until the [[Late Middle Ages]], centuries after the demise of the kingdom.\n\n==Nomenclature: Vesi, Tervingi, Visigoths==\nThe Visigoths are never called Visigoths, only Goths, until [[Cassiodorus]] used the term, when referring to their loss against [[Clovis I]] in 507. Cassiodorus apparently invented the term based on the model of the \"[[Ostrogoths]]\", but using the older name of the Vesi, one of the tribal names which the 5th century poet [[Sidonius Apollinaris]] used when referring to the Visigoths.{{sfn|Christensen|2002|p=219}}{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=25}} The first part of the Ostrogoth name is related to the word \"east\", and Jordanes later clearly stated in his ''Getica'' that \"Visigoths were the Goths of the western country.\"{{sfn|Jordanes|1915|p=74 [XIV.82]}} According to Wolfram, Cassiodorus created this east-west understanding of the Goths, which was a simplification and literary device, while political realities were more complex.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=26}} Cassiodorus himself used the term \"Goths\" to refer only to the Ostrogoths, whom he served, and reserved the geographical term \"Visigoths\" for the Gallo-Spanish Goths. In contrast, the term \"Visigoths\" was later used by the Visigoths themselves in their communications with the [[Byzantine Empire]] and was still in use in the 7th century.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=26}}\n\nTwo older tribal names from outside the Roman empire are associated with Visigoths who formed within the empire. The first references to any Gothic tribes by Roman and Greek authors were in the 3rd century, notably including the [[Thervingi]], who were once referred to as Goths by [[Ammianus Marcellinus]].{{sfn|Christensen|2002|pp=207\u2013212}} Much less is known of the \"Vesi\" or \"Visi\", from whom the name \"Visigoths\" derives. Before Sidonius Apollinaris, the Vesi were first mentioned in the ''[[Notitia Dignitatum]]'', a late 4th or early 5th century list of Roman military forces. This list also contains the last mention of the \"[[Thervingi]]\" in a classical source.{{sfn|Christensen|2002|pp=207\u2013212}}\n\nAlthough he did not refer to the Tervingi or Greuthungi, the medieval writer [[Jordanes]] identified the Visigoth (Vesi) kings from [[Alaric I]] to [[Alaric II]] as the successors of the 4th century Tervingian king [[Athanaric]], and the Ostrogoth kings from [[Theoderic the Great]] to [[Theodahad]] as the heirs of the Greuthungi king [[Ermanaric]].{{sfn|Heather|1998|pp=300\u2013301}}. Based on this, many scholars have traditionally treated the terms \"Vesi\" and \"Tervingi\" as referring to one particular tribe, while the terms \"Ostrogothi\" and \"[[Greuthungi]]\" were used to refer to another.{{sfn|Heather|1999|pp=43\u201344}}\n\nWolfram, who still recently defends the equation of Vesi with the Tervingi, argues that while primary sources occasionally list all four names (as in, for example, ''Gruthungi, Austrogothi, Tervingi, Visi''), whenever they mention two different tribes, they always refer either to \"the Vesi and the Ostrogothi\" or to \"the Tervingi and the Greuthungi\", and they never pair them up in any other combination. In addition, Wolfram interprets the ''[[Notitia Dignitatum]]'' as equating the Vesi with the Tervingi in a reference to the years 388\u2013391.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|pp=24\u201325}} On the other hand, another other recent interpretation of the ''Notitia'' is that the two names, Vesi and Tervingi, are found in different places in the list, \"a clear indication that we are dealing with two different army units, which must also presumably mean that they are, after all, perceived as two different peoples\".{{sfn|Christensen|2002|p=219}} Peter Heather has written that Wolfram's position is \"entirely arguable, but so is the opposite\".{{sfn|Heather|1999|p=75}}\n\n[[File:Gutthiuda.jpg|upright=1.5|thumb|right|Gutthiuda{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}]]\n\nWolfram believes that \"Vesi\" and \"Ostrogothi\" were terms each tribe used to boastfully describe itself and argues that \"Tervingi\" and \"Greuthungi\" were geographical identifiers each tribe used to describe the other.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=25}} This would explain why the latter terms dropped out of use shortly after 400, when the Goths were displaced by the [[Huns#Before Attila|Hunnic invasions]].{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=24}} Wolfram believes that the people Zosimus describes were those Tervingi who had remained behind after the Hunnic conquest.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=387, fn57}} For the most part, all of the terms discriminating between different Gothic tribes gradually disappeared after they moved into the Roman Empire.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=25}} \n\nMany recent scholars, such as [[Peter Heather]], have concluded that Visigothic group identity emerged only within the Roman Empire.{{sfn|Heather|1998|pp=52\u201357, 130\u2013178, 302\u2013309}} [[Roger Collins]] also believes that the Visigothic identity emerged from the [[Gothic War (376\u2013382)|Gothic War of 376\u2013382]] when a collection of Tervingi, Greuthungi, and other \"barbarian\" contingents banded together in multiethnic ''[[foederati]]'' (Wolfram's \"federate armies\") under Alaric I in the eastern [[Balkans]], since they had become a multi ethnic group and could no longer claim to be exclusively Tervingian.{{sfn|Collins|2004|pp=22\u201324}}\n\nOther names for other Gothic divisions abounded. In 469, the Visigoths were called the \"Alaric Goths\".{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=26}} The [[Frankish Table of Nations]], probably of Byzantine or Italian origin, referred to one of the two peoples as the ''Walagothi'', meaning \"Roman Goths\" (from Germanic *''[[walhaz]]'', foreign). This probably refers to the Romanized Visigoths after their entry into Spain.{{sfn|Goffart|1983|pp=125\u2013126}} [[Landolfus Sagax]], writing in the 10th or 11th century, calls the Visigoths the ''Hypogothi''.{{sfn|Friedrich|1910|p=14}}\n\n===Etymology of Tervingi and Vesi/Visigothi===\nThe name ''Tervingi'' may mean \"forest people\", with the first part of the name related to Gothic ''triu'', and English \"tree\".{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=25}} This is supported by evidence that geographic descriptors were commonly used to distinguish people living north of the [[Black Sea]] both before and after Gothic settlement there, by evidence of forest-related names among the Tervingi, and by the lack of evidence for an earlier date for the name pair Tervingi\u2013Greuthungi than the late 3rd century.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|pp=387\u2013388, fn58}} That the name ''Tervingi'' has pre-Pontic, possibly Scandinavian, origins still has support today.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=387, fn58}}\n\nThe Visigoths are called ''Wesi'' or ''Wisi'' by [[Trebellius Pollio]], Claudian, and Sidonius Apollinaris.{{sfn|Stevenson|1899|p=36, fn15}} The word is [[Gothic language|Gothic]] for \"good\", implying the \"good or worthy people\",{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=25}} related to Gothic ''iusiza'' \"better\" and a reflex of [[Proto Indo-European Language|Indo-European]] *''wesu'' \"good\", akin to [[Welsh language|Welsh]] ''gwiw'' \"excellent\", [[Ancient Greek language|Greek]] ''eus'' \"good\", [[Sanskrit]] ''v\u00e1su-\u015f'' \"id.\".

Eventually the Gothic language died as a result of contact with other European people during the [[Middle Ages]].{{sfn|Waldman|Mason|2006|p=844}}\n\nLong struggles between the neighboring Vandili and Lugii people with the Goths may have contributed to their earlier exodus into mainland Europe. The vast majority of them settled between the [[Oder]] and [[Vistula]] rivers until overpopulation (according to Gothic legends or tribal sagas) forced them to move south and east, where they settled just north of the [[Black Sea]].{{sfn|Wolfram|1997|p=42\u201343}} However, this legend is not supported by archaeological evidence so its validity is disputable. Historian Malcolm Todd contends that while this large ''en masse'' migration is possible, the movement of Gothic peoples south-east was more likely the result of warrior bands moving closer to the wealth of [[Ukraine]] and the cities of the Black Sea coast. Perhaps what is most notable about the Gothic people in this regard was that by the middle of the 3rd century AD, they were \"the most formidable military power beyond the lower Danube frontier\".{{sfn|Todd|2000|pp=149\u2013150}}{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|pp=42\u201355}}\n\n====Contact with Rome====\n[[File:Tezaurul de la Pietroasele Closca MNIR Tezaur.JPG|thumb|left|The [[Pietroasele Treasure]] discovered in Romania, attributed to the Visigoths{{sfn|Odobescu|1889|p=1-100}}]]\nThroughout the third and fourth centuries there were numerous conflicts and exchanges of varying types between the Goths and their neighbors. After the Romans withdrew from the territory of Dacia, the local population was subjected to constant invasions by the migratory tribes, among the first being the Goths.{{sfn|Georgescu|1991|p=11}} In 238, the Goths invaded across the Danube into the Roman province of [[Moesia]], pillaging and exacting payment through hostage taking. During the war with the Persians that year, Goths also appeared in the Roman armies of [[Gordian III]].{{sfn|Todd|2000|p=150}} When subsidies to the Goths were stopped, the Goths organized and in 250 joined a major barbarian invasion led by the Germanic king, Kniva.{{sfn|Todd|2000|p=150}} Success on the battlefield against the Romans inspired additional invasions into the northern [[Balkans]] and deeper into [[Anatolia]].{{sfn|Todd|2000|pp=150\u2013151}} Starting in approximately 255, the Goths added a new dimension to their attacks by taking to the sea and invading harbors which brought them into conflict with the Greeks as well. When the city of [[Pityus]] fell to the Goths in 256, the Goths were further emboldened. Sometime between 266\u2013267, the Goths raided Greece but when they attempted to move into the Bosporus straits to attack Byzantium, they were repulsed. Along with other Germanic tribes, they attacked further into Anatolia, assaulting Crete and Cyprus on the way; shortly thereafter, they pillaged Troy and the temple of Artemis at Ephesus.{{sfn|Todd|2000|p=151}} Throughout the reign of emperor [[Constantine the Great]], the Visigoths continued to conduct raids on Roman territory south of the Danube River.{{sfn|Waldman|Mason|2006|p=844}} By 332, relations between the Goths and Romans were stabilized by a treaty but this was not to last.{{sfn|Todd|2000|p=152}}\n\n===War with Rome (376\u2013382)===\n{{Main|Gothic War (376\u2013382)}}\nThe Goths remained in [[Dacia]] until 376, when one of their leaders, [[Fritigern]], appealed to the Roman emperor [[Valens]] to be allowed to settle with his people on the south bank of the [[Danube River|Danube]]. Here, they hoped to find refuge from the [[Huns]].{{sfn|Waldman|Mason|2006|pp=844\u2013845}} Valens permitted this, as he saw in them \"a splendid recruiting ground for his army\".{{sfn|Fuller|1998|p=55}} However, a [[famine]] broke out and Rome was unwilling to supply them with either the food they were promised or the land. Generally, the Goths were abused by the Romans,{{sfn|Waldman|Mason|2006|p=845}} who began forcing the now starving Goths to trade away their children so as to stave off starvation.{{sfn|Durant|1950|p=24}} Open revolt ensued, leading to 6 years of plundering throughout the Balkans, the death of a Roman Emperor and a disastrous defeat of the Roman army.{{sfn|Durant|1950|pp=24\u201325}}\n\nThe [[Battle of Adrianople (378)|Battle of Adrianople]] in 378 was the decisive moment of the war. The Roman forces were slaughtered and the Emperor [[Valens]] was killed during the fighting.{{sfn|Sarris|2002|p=36}} Precisely how Valens fell remains uncertain but Gothic legend tells of how the emperor was taken to a farmhouse, which was set on fire above his head, a tale made more popular by its symbolic representation of a heretical emperor receiving hell's torment.{{sfn|Halsall|2007|pp=178\u2013179}} Many of Rome's leading officers and some of their most elite fighting men died during the battle which struck a major blow to Roman prestige and the Empire's military capabilities.{{sfn|Halsall|2007|p=179}} Adrianople shocked the Roman world and eventually forced the Romans to negotiate with and settle the tribe within the empire's boundaries, a development with far-reaching consequences for the eventual [[fall of the Western Roman Empire|fall of Rome]]. Fourth-century Roman soldier and historian [[Ammianus Marcellinus]] ended his chronology of Roman history with this battle.{{sfn|Katz|1955|pp=88\u201389}}\n\nDespite the severe consequences for Rome, Adrianople was not nearly as productive overall for the Visigoths and their gains were short-lived. Still confined to a small and relatively impoverished province of the Empire, another Roman army was being gathered against them, an army which also had amid its ranks other disaffected Goths.{{sfn|Todd|2000|p=154}} Intense campaigns against the Visigoths followed their victory at Adrianople for upwards of three years. Approach routes across the Danube provinces were effectively sealed off by concerted Roman efforts, and while there was no decisive victory to claim, it was essentially a Roman triumph ending in a treaty in 382. The treaty struck with the Goths was to be the first ''foedus'' on imperial Roman soil. It required these semi-autonomous Germanic tribes to raise troops for the Roman army in exchange for arable land and freedom from Roman legal structures within the Empire.{{sfn|Halsall|2007|pp=179\u2013180}}{{Efn|Other sources dispute the contents of the supposed \"treaty\" and claim it was a Gothic surrender.{{sfn|Halsall|2007|pp=180\u2013181}} }}\n\n===Reign of Alaric I===\n[[File:Alaric entering Athens.jpg|upright=0.9|thumb|right|An illustration of [[Alaric I|Alaric]] entering [[Athens]] in 395]]\n{{Main|Alaric I}}\nThe new emperor, [[Theodosius I]], made peace with the rebels, and this peace held essentially unbroken until Theodosius died in 395.{{sfn|Burns|2003|pp=322, 374}} In that year, the Visigoths' most famous king, [[Alaric I]], made a bid for the throne, but controversy and intrigue erupted between the East and West, as General [[Stilicho]] tried to maintain his position in the empire.{{sfn|Heather|2013|pp=153\u2013160}} Theodosius was succeeded by his incompetent sons: [[Arcadius]] in the east and [[Flavius Augustus Honorius|Honorius]] in the west. In 397, Alaric was named military commander of the eastern Illyrian prefecture by Arcadius.{{sfn|Waldman|Mason|2006|p=845}}\n\nOver the next 15 years, an uneasy peace was broken by occasional conflicts between Alaric and the powerful Germanic generals who commanded the Roman armies in the east and west, wielding the real power of the empire.{{sfn|Heather|2013|pp=183\u2013223}} Finally, after the western general Stilicho was executed by Honorius in 408 and the Roman legions massacred the families of thousands of barbarian soldiers who were trying to assimilate into the Roman empire, Alaric decided to march on Rome.{{sfn|Frassetto|2003|pp=204\u2013205}} After two defeats in Northern Italy and a siege of Rome ended by a negotiated pay-off, Alaric was cheated by another Roman faction. He resolved to cut the city off by capturing its port. On August 24, 410, however, Alaric's troops entered Rome through the [[Salarian Gate]], and [[sack of Rome (410)|sacked the city]].{{sfn|Halsall|2007|pp=214\u2013217}} However, Rome, while still the official capital, was no longer the ''de facto'' seat of the government of the Western Roman Empire. From the late 370s up to 402, [[Milan]] was the seat of government, but after the siege of Milan the Imperial Court moved to [[Ravenna]] in 402. Honorius visited Rome often, and after his death in 423 the emperors resided mostly there. Rome's fall severely shook the Empire's confidence, especially in the West. Loaded with booty, Alaric and the Visigoths extracted as much as they could with the intention of leaving Italy from Basilicata to northern [[Africa]]. Alaric died before the disembarkation and was buried supposedly near the ruins of Croton.

For a brief period, the Visigoths controlled the strongest kingdom in Western Europe.{{sfn|Williams|2004|p=51}} In response to the invasion of [[Hispania|Roman Hispania]] of 409 by the [[Vandals]], [[Alans]] and [[Suebi]], [[Honorius (emperor)|Honorius]], the emperor in the West, enlisted the aid of the Visigoths to regain control of the territory. From 408 to 410 the Visigoths caused so much damage to Rome and the immediate periphery that nearly a decade later, the provinces in and around the city were only able to contribute one-seventh of their previous tax shares.{{sfn|Heather|2005|p=434}}\n\nIn 418, Honorius rewarded his Visigothic [[foederati|federates]] by giving them land in [[Gallia Aquitania]] on which to settle after they had attacked the four tribes \u2013 Sueves, Asding and Siling Vandala and Alans \u2013 who had crossed the Rhine near Mainz the last day of 409 and eventually were invited into Spain by a Roman usurper in the Fall of 409 (the latter two tribes were devastated). This was probably done under ''hospitalitas'', the rules for billeting army soldiers.{{sfn|Sivan|1987|pp=759\u2013772}} The settlement formed the nucleus of the future Visigothic kingdom that would eventually expand across the [[Pyrenees]] and onto the Iberian peninsula. That Visigothic settlement proved paramount to Europe's future as had it not been for the Visigothic warriors who fought side-by-side with the Roman troops under general [[Flavius Aetius]], it is perhaps possible that [[Attila]] would have seized control of Gaul, rather than the Romans being able to retain dominance.{{sfn|Burns|2003|p=382}}\n\nThe Visigoths' second great king, [[Euric]], unified the various quarreling factions among the Visigoths and, in 475, forced the Roman government to come to terms, but the emperor did not legally recognize Gothic sovereignty; instead the emperor was content to be called a friend (''amicus'') to the Visigoths, while requiring them to address him as lord (''dominus'').{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|pp=186\u2013187}} Between 471\u2013476, Euric captured most of southern Gaul.{{sfn|Frassetto|2003|p=358}} According to historian J.

The Visigoths scorned to interfere among Catholics but were interested in decorum and public order.{{Efn|At least one high-ranking Visigoth, [[Zerezindo]], ''dux'' of Baetica, was a Catholic in the mid-6th century.}} King [[Liuvigild]] (568\u2013586), attempted to restore political unity between the Visigothic-Arian elite and the Hispano-Roman Nicene Catholic population through a doctrinal settlement of compromise on matters of faith, but this failed.{{sfn|Heather|2013|p=325}} Sources indicate that the Iberian Visigoths maintained their Christian Arianism, especially the Visigothic elite until the end of Liuvigild's reign.{{sfn|Wolfram|1997|pp=265\u2013269}} When Reccared I converted to Catholicism, he sought to unify the kingdom under a single faith.{{sfn|Frassetto|2003|p=304}}{{sfn|Mathisen|Sivan|1999|p=40}}\n\n[[File:Wisi San Pedro de la Nave e chapiteau a.jpg|thumb|left|Capital from the Visigothic church of [[San Pedro de la Nave]], [[province of Zamora]]]]\n\nWhen the Visigoths took over Spain, [[Jews]] constituted a large and ancient proportion of the population. Many were farmers, but they worked in a wide range of occupations, and were a major component of the urbanized population of the larger towns particularly of eastern Spain. During the period in which the Visigoths adhered to Arianism, the situation of the Jews seems to have remained relatively good.  Previous Roman and Byzantine law determined their status, and it already sharply discriminated against them, but royal jurisdiction was in any case quite limited: local lords and populations related to Jews as they saw fit. We read of rabbis being asked by non-Jews to bless their fields, for example.{{sfn|Graetz|1894|p=44}} Historian Jane Gerber relates that some of the Jews \"held ranking posts in the government or the army; others were recruited and organized for garrison service; still others continued to hold senatorial rank\".{{sfn|Gerber|1992|p=9}} In general, then, they were well respected and well-treated by the Visigothic kings, that is, until their transition from Arianism to Catholicism.{{sfn|Roth|1994|pp=35\u201340}}\n\nCatholic conversion across Visigothic society reduced much of the friction between their people and the native Spanish population.{{sfn|Waldman|Mason|2006|p=847}} One chief purpose of this conversion was to unify the realm under the Church, and one of the key complaints of the Church had long been that Jews had too much status, prosperity and influence. Local nobles relied on their Jewish and non-Jewish sectors of the population to enhance the local economy and the noble's independent power. Visigothic political structure had traditionally given extensive powers to local nobles (who even elected their kings), so the king was in many ways merely 'the first amongst equals,' and central authority was weak. The status of the Jews therefore impacted local aristocrats both symbolically and politically.\n\nKing Reccared convened the Third Council of Toledo to settle religious disputations related to the religious conversion from Arianism to Catholicism.{{sfn|Collins|1999|pp=211\u2013212}} The discriminatory laws passed at this Council seem not to have been universally enforced, however, as indicated by several more Councils of Toledo that repeated these laws and extended their stringency.  These entered canon law and became legal precedents in other parts of Europe as well.  The culmination of this process occurred under King Sisibut, who decreed a forced Christian conversion upon all Jews in Spain.{{sfn|Collins|2000|p=60}} This mandate apparently achieved only partial success: similar decrees were repeated by later kings as central power was consolidated. These laws either prescribed forcible baptism of the Jews or forbade circumcision, Jewish rites, and the observance of the Sabbath and other festivals. Throughout the seventh century, Jews were flogged, executed, had their property confiscated, were subjected to ruinous taxes, forbidden to trade and, at times, dragged to the baptismal font. Many were obliged to accept Christianity but continued privately to observe the Jewish religion and practices.{{sfn|Gonzalez-Salinero|1999|pp=140\u2013147}} The decree of 613 set off a century of torment for Spanish Jewry, which was only ended by the Muslim conquest.{{Efn|Cf. the extensive accounts of Visigothic Jewish history by Heinrich Graetz, ''History of the Jews'', Vol. 3 (Philadelphia: Jewish Publication Society of America, 1956 reprint [1894]), pp. 43\u201352 (on Sisibut, pp. 47\u201349); Salo W.

Cohen and D. Sorkin, ''The Oxford Handbook of Jewish Studies'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2002), p. 156.}}\n\nThe political aspects of the imposition of Church power cannot be ignored in these matters. With the conversion of the Visigothic kings to [[Chalcedonian Christianity]], the bishops increased their power, until, at the [[Fourth Council of Toledo]] in 633, they selected a king from among the royal family, a practice previously reserved for nobles. This was the same synod that declared that all Jews must be [[baptism|baptised]]. As far as the Visigoths were concerned, the time for religious pluralism \"was past\".{{sfn|Lim|1999|pp=209\u2013210}} By the end of the 7th century, Catholic conversion made the Visigoths less distinguishable from the indigenous Roman citizens of the Iberian peninsula; when the last Visigothic strongholds fell to the Muslim armies, whose subsequent invasions transformed Spain from the beginning of the 8th century, their Gothic identity faded.{{sfn|Collins|2000|pp=60\u201362}}\n\nIn the eighth through 11th centuries, the [[muladi|''muwallad'']] clan of the [[Banu Qasi]] claimed descent from the Visigothic [[Count Cassius]].{{sfn|Fletcher|2006|p=45}}\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Ancient Germanic culture}}\n*[[Romano-Germanic culture]]\n*[[Germanic peoples]]\n*[[Arianism]]\n*[[Thiufa]]\n\n==References==\n===Notes===\n{{notelist}}\n\n===Citations===\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{refbegin|30em|indent=yes}}\n* {{cite book| last=Arce |first=Javier| chapter=The City of Merida (Emerita) in the Vitas Patrum Emeritensium (Vith Century) | title=East and West, Modes of Communication: Proceedings of the First Plenary Conference at Merida  | editor1=Evangelos Chrysos | editor2=Ian Wood| volume=Vol. 5 [Transformation of the Roman World] | year = 1999| location = Leiden | publisher = Brill | isbn=978-9-00410-929-2|ref = harv}}\n*{{cite book | last=Burns | first=Thomas | year=2003 | title= Rome and the Barbarians, 100 B.C.\u2013A.D. 400 | place= Baltimore, MD | publisher= Johns Hopkins University Press | isbn= 978-0-80187-306-5 | ref = harv}}\n*{{cite book | last=Bury | first=J.

Afterwards, they began settling down, first in southern [[Gaul]] and eventually in [[Hispania]], where they founded the [[Visigothic Kingdom]] and maintained a presence from the 5th to the 8th centuries AD.{{sfn|Waldman|Mason|2006|pp=843\u2013844}}\n\nThe Visigoths first settled in southern Gaul as ''[[foederati]]'' to the Romans, a relationship established in 418. However, they soon fell out with their Roman hosts (for reasons that are now obscure) and established their own kingdom with its [[Capital city|capital]] at [[Toulouse]]. They next extended their authority into [[Hispania]] at the expense of the [[Suebi]] and [[Vandals]]. In 507, however, their rule in Gaul was ended by the [[Franks]] under [[Clovis I]], who defeated them in the [[Battle of Vouill\u00e9]]. After that, the Visigoth kingdom was limited to [[Hispania]], and they never again held territory north of the [[Pyrenees]] other than [[Septimania]]. A small, elite group of Visigoths came to dominate the governance of that region at the expense of those who had previously ruled there, particularly in the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] province of [[Spania]] and the [[Kingdom of the Suebi]].\n\nIn or around 589, the Visigoths under [[Reccared I]] converted from [[Arianism]] to [[Nicene Christianity]], gradually adopting the culture of their Hispano-Roman subjects.{{sfn|Claude|1998|pp=119\u2013120}} Their legal code, the ''[[Visigothic Code]]'' (completed in 654) abolished the longstanding practice of applying different laws for Romans and Visigoths. Once legal distinctions were no longer being made between ''Romani'' and ''Gothi'', they became known collectively as ''Hispani''. In the century that followed, the region was dominated by the [[Councils of Toledo]] and the episcopacy. Little else is known about the Visigoths history during the 7th century, since records are relatively sparse. In 711 or 712, an [[Umayyad conquest of Hispania|invading force of Arabs and Berbers]] defeated the Visigoths in the [[Battle of Guadalete]]. Their king, [[Roderic]], and many members of their governing elite were killed, and their kingdom rapidly collapsed. \n\nDuring their governance of [[Hispania]], the Visigoths [[Visigothic art and architecture|built several churches]] that survive. They also left many artifacts, which have been discovered in increasing numbers by archaeologists in recent times. The [[Treasure of Guarrazar]] of [[votive crown]]s and crosses is the most spectacular. They founded the only new cities in western Europe from the fall of the Western half of the Roman Empire until the rise of the [[Carolingian dynasty]]. Many Visigothic names are still in use in modern [[List of Spanish words of Germanic origin#Names|Spanish]] and [[List of Portuguese words of Germanic origin#Names|Portuguese]]. Their most notable legacy, however, was the ''[[Visigothic Code]]'', which served, among other things, as the basis for court procedure in most of Christian [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberia]] until the [[Late Middle Ages]], centuries after the demise of the kingdom.\n\n==Nomenclature: Vesi, Tervingi, Visigoths==\nThe Visigoths are never called Visigoths, only Goths, until [[Cassiodorus]] used the term, when referring to their loss against [[Clovis I]] in 507. Cassiodorus apparently invented the term based on the model of the \"[[Ostrogoths]]\", but using the older name of the Vesi, one of the tribal names which the 5th century poet [[Sidonius Apollinaris]] used when referring to the Visigoths.{{sfn|Christensen|2002|p=219}}{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=25}} The first part of the Ostrogoth name is related to the word \"east\", and Jordanes later clearly stated in his ''Getica'' that \"Visigoths were the Goths of the western country.\"{{sfn|Jordanes|1915|p=74 [XIV.82]}} According to Wolfram, Cassiodorus created this east-west understanding of the Goths, which was a simplification and literary device, while political realities were more complex.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=26}} Cassiodorus himself used the term \"Goths\" to refer only to the Ostrogoths, whom he served, and reserved the geographical term \"Visigoths\" for the Gallo-Spanish Goths. In contrast, the term \"Visigoths\" was later used by the Visigoths themselves in their communications with the [[Byzantine Empire]] and was still in use in the 7th century.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=26}}\n\nTwo older tribal names from outside the Roman empire are associated with Visigoths who formed within the empire. The first references to any Gothic tribes by Roman and Greek authors were in the 3rd century, notably including the [[Thervingi]], who were once referred to as Goths by [[Ammianus Marcellinus]].{{sfn|Christensen|2002|pp=207\u2013212}} Much less is known of the \"Vesi\" or \"Visi\", from whom the name \"Visigoths\" derives. Before Sidonius Apollinaris, the Vesi were first mentioned in the ''[[Notitia Dignitatum]]'', a late 4th or early 5th century list of Roman military forces. This list also contains the last mention of the \"[[Thervingi]]\" in a classical source.{{sfn|Christensen|2002|pp=207\u2013212}}\n\nAlthough he did not refer to the Tervingi or Greuthungi, the medieval writer [[Jordanes]] identified the Visigoth (Vesi) kings from [[Alaric I]] to [[Alaric II]] as the successors of the 4th century Tervingian king [[Athanaric]], and the Ostrogoth kings from [[Theoderic the Great]] to [[Theodahad]] as the heirs of the Greuthungi king [[Ermanaric]].{{sfn|Heather|1998|pp=300\u2013301}}. Based on this, many scholars have traditionally treated the terms \"Vesi\" and \"Tervingi\" as referring to one particular tribe, while the terms \"Ostrogothi\" and \"[[Greuthungi]]\" were used to refer to another.{{sfn|Heather|1999|pp=43\u201344}}\n\nWolfram, who still recently defends the equation of Vesi with the Tervingi, argues that while primary sources occasionally list all four names (as in, for example, ''Gruthungi, Austrogothi, Tervingi, Visi''), whenever they mention two different tribes, they always refer either to \"the Vesi and the Ostrogothi\" or to \"the Tervingi and the Greuthungi\", and they never pair them up in any other combination. In addition, Wolfram interprets the ''[[Notitia Dignitatum]]'' as equating the Vesi with the Tervingi in a reference to the years 388\u2013391.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|pp=24\u201325}} On the other hand, another other recent interpretation of the ''Notitia'' is that the two names, Vesi and Tervingi, are found in different places in the list, \"a clear indication that we are dealing with two different army units, which must also presumably mean that they are, after all, perceived as two different peoples\".{{sfn|Christensen|2002|p=219}} Peter Heather has written that Wolfram's position is \"entirely arguable, but so is the opposite\".{{sfn|Heather|1999|p=75}}\n\n[[File:Gutthiuda.jpg|upright=1.5|thumb|right|Gutthiuda{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}]]\n\nWolfram believes that \"Vesi\" and \"Ostrogothi\" were terms each tribe used to boastfully describe itself and argues that \"Tervingi\" and \"Greuthungi\" were geographical identifiers each tribe used to describe the other.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=25}} This would explain why the latter terms dropped out of use shortly after 400, when the Goths were displaced by the [[Huns#Before Attila|Hunnic invasions]].{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=24}} Wolfram believes that the people Zosimus describes were those Tervingi who had remained behind after the Hunnic conquest.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=387, fn57}} For the most part, all of the terms discriminating between different Gothic tribes gradually disappeared after they moved into the Roman Empire.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=25}} \n\nMany recent scholars, such as [[Peter Heather]], have concluded that Visigothic group identity emerged only within the Roman Empire.{{sfn|Heather|1998|pp=52\u201357, 130\u2013178, 302\u2013309}} [[Roger Collins]] also believes that the Visigothic identity emerged from the [[Gothic War (376\u2013382)|Gothic War of 376\u2013382]] when a collection of Tervingi, Greuthungi, and other \"barbarian\" contingents banded together in multiethnic ''[[foederati]]'' (Wolfram's \"federate armies\") under Alaric I in the eastern [[Balkans]], since they had become a multi ethnic group and could no longer claim to be exclusively Tervingian.{{sfn|Collins|2004|pp=22\u201324}}\n\nOther names for other Gothic divisions abounded. In 469, the Visigoths were called the \"Alaric Goths\".{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=26}} The [[Frankish Table of Nations]], probably of Byzantine or Italian origin, referred to one of the two peoples as the ''Walagothi'', meaning \"Roman Goths\" (from Germanic *''[[walhaz]]'', foreign). This probably refers to the Romanized Visigoths after their entry into Spain.{{sfn|Goffart|1983|pp=125\u2013126}} [[Landolfus Sagax]], writing in the 10th or 11th century, calls the Visigoths the ''Hypogothi''.{{sfn|Friedrich|1910|p=14}}\n\n===Etymology of Tervingi and Vesi/Visigothi===\nThe name ''Tervingi'' may mean \"forest people\", with the first part of the name related to Gothic ''triu'', and English \"tree\".{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=25}} This is supported by evidence that geographic descriptors were commonly used to distinguish people living north of the [[Black Sea]] both before and after Gothic settlement there, by evidence of forest-related names among the Tervingi, and by the lack of evidence for an earlier date for the name pair Tervingi\u2013Greuthungi than the late 3rd century.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|pp=387\u2013388, fn58}} That the name ''Tervingi'' has pre-Pontic, possibly Scandinavian, origins still has support today.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=387, fn58}}\n\nThe Visigoths are called ''Wesi'' or ''Wisi'' by [[Trebellius Pollio]], Claudian, and Sidonius Apollinaris.{{sfn|Stevenson|1899|p=36, fn15}} The word is [[Gothic language|Gothic]] for \"good\", implying the \"good or worthy people\",{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=25}} related to Gothic ''iusiza'' \"better\" and a reflex of [[Proto Indo-European Language|Indo-European]] *''wesu'' \"good\", akin to [[Welsh language|Welsh]] ''gwiw'' \"excellent\", [[Ancient Greek language|Greek]] ''eus'' \"good\", [[Sanskrit]] ''v\u00e1su-\u015f'' \"id.\". Jordanes relates the tribe's name to a river, though this is most likely a [[folk etymology]] or legend like his similar story about the Greuthung name.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=387, fn58}}\n\n==History==\n[[File:Visigoth migrations.jpg|right|thumb|upright=1.35|Migrations of the main column of the Visigoths]]\n\n===Early origins===\nThe Visigoths emerged from the Gothic tribes, most likely a derivative name for the [[Gutones]], a people believed to have their origins in [[Scandinavia]] and who migrated southeastwards into eastern Europe.{{sfn|Wolfram|1997|p=39\u201340}} Such understanding of their origins is largely the result of Gothic traditions and their true genesis as a people is as obscure as that of the [[Franks]] and [[Alamanni]].{{sfn|Todd|2000|p=149}} The Visigoths spoke an eastern Germanic language that was distinct by the 4th century. Eventually the Gothic language died as a result of contact with other European people during the [[Middle Ages]].{{sfn|Waldman|Mason|2006|p=844}}\n\nLong struggles between the neighboring Vandili and Lugii people with the Goths may have contributed to their earlier exodus into mainland Europe. The vast majority of them settled between the [[Oder]] and [[Vistula]] rivers until overpopulation (according to Gothic legends or tribal sagas) forced them to move south and east, where they settled just north of the [[Black Sea]].{{sfn|Wolfram|1997|p=42\u201343}} However, this legend is not supported by archaeological evidence so its validity is disputable. Historian Malcolm Todd contends that while this large ''en masse'' migration is possible, the movement of Gothic peoples south-east was more likely the result of warrior bands moving closer to the wealth of [[Ukraine]] and the cities of the Black Sea coast. Perhaps what is most notable about the Gothic people in this regard was that by the middle of the 3rd century AD, they were \"the most formidable military power beyond the lower Danube frontier\".{{sfn|Todd|2000|pp=149\u2013150}}{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|pp=42\u201355}}\n\n====Contact with Rome====\n[[File:Tezaurul de la Pietroasele Closca MNIR Tezaur.JPG|thumb|left|The [[Pietroasele Treasure]] discovered in Romania, attributed to the Visigoths{{sfn|Odobescu|1889|p=1-100}}]]\nThroughout the third and fourth centuries there were numerous conflicts and exchanges of varying types between the Goths and their neighbors. After the Romans withdrew from the territory of Dacia, the local population was subjected to constant invasions by the migratory tribes, among the first being the Goths.{{sfn|Georgescu|1991|p=11}} In 238, the Goths invaded across the Danube into the Roman province of [[Moesia]], pillaging and exacting payment through hostage taking. During the war with the Persians that year, Goths also appeared in the Roman armies of [[Gordian III]].{{sfn|Todd|2000|p=150}} When subsidies to the Goths were stopped, the Goths organized and in 250 joined a major barbarian invasion led by the Germanic king, Kniva.{{sfn|Todd|2000|p=150}} Success on the battlefield against the Romans inspired additional invasions into the northern [[Balkans]] and deeper into [[Anatolia]].{{sfn|Todd|2000|pp=150\u2013151}} Starting in approximately 255, the Goths added a new dimension to their attacks by taking to the sea and invading harbors which brought them into conflict with the Greeks as well. When the city of [[Pityus]] fell to the Goths in 256, the Goths were further emboldened. Sometime between 266\u2013267, the Goths raided Greece but when they attempted to move into the Bosporus straits to attack Byzantium, they were repulsed. Along with other Germanic tribes, they attacked further into Anatolia, assaulting Crete and Cyprus on the way; shortly thereafter, they pillaged Troy and the temple of Artemis at Ephesus.{{sfn|Todd|2000|p=151}} Throughout the reign of emperor [[Constantine the Great]], the Visigoths continued to conduct raids on Roman territory south of the Danube River.{{sfn|Waldman|Mason|2006|p=844}} By 332, relations between the Goths and Romans were stabilized by a treaty but this was not to last.{{sfn|Todd|2000|p=152}}\n\n===War with Rome (376\u2013382)===\n{{Main|Gothic War (376\u2013382)}}\nThe Goths remained in [[Dacia]] until 376, when one of their leaders, [[Fritigern]], appealed to the Roman emperor [[Valens]] to be allowed to settle with his people on the south bank of the [[Danube River|Danube]]. Here, they hoped to find refuge from the [[Huns]].{{sfn|Waldman|Mason|2006|pp=844\u2013845}} Valens permitted this, as he saw in them \"a splendid recruiting ground for his army\".{{sfn|Fuller|1998|p=55}} However, a [[famine]] broke out and Rome was unwilling to supply them with either the food they were promised or the land. Generally, the Goths were abused by the Romans,{{sfn|Waldman|Mason|2006|p=845}} who began forcing the now starving Goths to trade away their children so as to stave off starvation.{{sfn|Durant|1950|p=24}} Open revolt ensued, leading to 6 years of plundering throughout the Balkans, the death of a Roman Emperor and a disastrous defeat of the Roman army.{{sfn|Durant|1950|pp=24\u201325}}\n\nThe [[Battle of Adrianople (378)|Battle of Adrianople]] in 378 was the decisive moment of the war. The Roman forces were slaughtered and the Emperor [[Valens]] was killed during the fighting.{{sfn|Sarris|2002|p=36}} Precisely how Valens fell remains uncertain but Gothic legend tells of how the emperor was taken to a farmhouse, which was set on fire above his head, a tale made more popular by its symbolic representation of a heretical emperor receiving hell's torment.{{sfn|Halsall|2007|pp=178\u2013179}} Many of Rome's leading officers and some of their most elite fighting men died during the battle which struck a major blow to Roman prestige and the Empire's military capabilities.{{sfn|Halsall|2007|p=179}} Adrianople shocked the Roman world and eventually forced the Romans to negotiate with and settle the tribe within the empire's boundaries, a development with far-reaching consequences for the eventual [[fall of the Western Roman Empire|fall of Rome]]. Fourth-century Roman soldier and historian [[Ammianus Marcellinus]] ended his chronology of Roman history with this battle.{{sfn|Katz|1955|pp=88\u201389}}\n\nDespite the severe consequences for Rome, Adrianople was not nearly as productive overall for the Visigoths and their gains were short-lived. Still confined to a small and relatively impoverished province of the Empire, another Roman army was being gathered against them, an army which also had amid its ranks other disaffected Goths.{{sfn|Todd|2000|p=154}} Intense campaigns against the Visigoths followed their victory at Adrianople for upwards of three years. Approach routes across the Danube provinces were effectively sealed off by concerted Roman efforts, and while there was no decisive victory to claim, it was essentially a Roman triumph ending in a treaty in 382. The treaty struck with the Goths was to be the first ''foedus'' on imperial Roman soil. It required these semi-autonomous Germanic tribes to raise troops for the Roman army in exchange for arable land and freedom from Roman legal structures within the Empire.{{sfn|Halsall|2007|pp=179\u2013180}}{{Efn|Other sources dispute the contents of the supposed \"treaty\" and claim it was a Gothic surrender.{{sfn|Halsall|2007|pp=180\u2013181}} }}\n\n===Reign of Alaric I===\n[[File:Alaric entering Athens.jpg|upright=0.9|thumb|right|An illustration of [[Alaric I|Alaric]] entering [[Athens]] in 395]]\n{{Main|Alaric I}}\nThe new emperor, [[Theodosius I]], made peace with the rebels, and this peace held essentially unbroken until Theodosius died in 395.{{sfn|Burns|2003|pp=322, 374}} In that year, the Visigoths' most famous king, [[Alaric I]], made a bid for the throne, but controversy and intrigue erupted between the East and West, as General [[Stilicho]] tried to maintain his position in the empire.{{sfn|Heather|2013|pp=153\u2013160}} Theodosius was succeeded by his incompetent sons: [[Arcadius]] in the east and [[Flavius Augustus Honorius|Honorius]] in the west. In 397, Alaric was named military commander of the eastern Illyrian prefecture by Arcadius.{{sfn|Waldman|Mason|2006|p=845}}\n\nOver the next 15 years, an uneasy peace was broken by occasional conflicts between Alaric and the powerful Germanic generals who commanded the Roman armies in the east and west, wielding the real power of the empire.{{sfn|Heather|2013|pp=183\u2013223}} Finally, after the western general Stilicho was executed by Honorius in 408 and the Roman legions massacred the families of thousands of barbarian soldiers who were trying to assimilate into the Roman empire, Alaric decided to march on Rome.{{sfn|Frassetto|2003|pp=204\u2013205}} After two defeats in Northern Italy and a siege of Rome ended by a negotiated pay-off, Alaric was cheated by another Roman faction. He resolved to cut the city off by capturing its port. On August 24, 410, however, Alaric's troops entered Rome through the [[Salarian Gate]], and [[sack of Rome (410)|sacked the city]].{{sfn|Halsall|2007|pp=214\u2013217}} However, Rome, while still the official capital, was no longer the ''de facto'' seat of the government of the Western Roman Empire. From the late 370s up to 402, [[Milan]] was the seat of government, but after the siege of Milan the Imperial Court moved to [[Ravenna]] in 402. Honorius visited Rome often, and after his death in 423 the emperors resided mostly there. Rome's fall severely shook the Empire's confidence, especially in the West. Loaded with booty, Alaric and the Visigoths extracted as much as they could with the intention of leaving Italy from Basilicata to northern [[Africa]]. Alaric died before the disembarkation and was buried supposedly near the ruins of Croton. He was succeeded by his wife's brother.{{sfn|Collins|1999|pp=63\u201365}}\n\n===Visigothic Kingdom===\n{{Main|Visigothic Kingdom}}\n[[File:Europe and the Near East at 476 AD.png|thumb|upright=1.6|Europe at the fall of the Western Roman Empire in 476 AD]]\n\nThe Visigothic Kingdom was a Western European power in the 5th to 7th centuries, created in Gaul when the Romans lost their control of the western half of their empire. For a brief period, the Visigoths controlled the strongest kingdom in Western Europe.{{sfn|Williams|2004|p=51}} In response to the invasion of [[Hispania|Roman Hispania]] of 409 by the [[Vandals]], [[Alans]] and [[Suebi]], [[Honorius (emperor)|Honorius]], the emperor in the West, enlisted the aid of the Visigoths to regain control of the territory. From 408 to 410 the Visigoths caused so much damage to Rome and the immediate periphery that nearly a decade later, the provinces in and around the city were only able to contribute one-seventh of their previous tax shares.{{sfn|Heather|2005|p=434}}\n\nIn 418, Honorius rewarded his Visigothic [[foederati|federates]] by giving them land in [[Gallia Aquitania]] on which to settle after they had attacked the four tribes \u2013 Sueves, Asding and Siling Vandala and Alans \u2013 who had crossed the Rhine near Mainz the last day of 409 and eventually were invited into Spain by a Roman usurper in the Fall of 409 (the latter two tribes were devastated). This was probably done under ''hospitalitas'', the rules for billeting army soldiers.{{sfn|Sivan|1987|pp=759\u2013772}} The settlement formed the nucleus of the future Visigothic kingdom that would eventually expand across the [[Pyrenees]] and onto the Iberian peninsula. That Visigothic settlement proved paramount to Europe's future as had it not been for the Visigothic warriors who fought side-by-side with the Roman troops under general [[Flavius Aetius]], it is perhaps possible that [[Attila]] would have seized control of Gaul, rather than the Romans being able to retain dominance.{{sfn|Burns|2003|p=382}}\n\nThe Visigoths' second great king, [[Euric]], unified the various quarreling factions among the Visigoths and, in 475, forced the Roman government to come to terms, but the emperor did not legally recognize Gothic sovereignty; instead the emperor was content to be called a friend (''amicus'') to the Visigoths, while requiring them to address him as lord (''dominus'').{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|pp=186\u2013187}} Between 471\u2013476, Euric captured most of southern Gaul.{{sfn|Frassetto|2003|p=358}} According to historian J.

Theodoric's death in 526, however, enabled the Visigoths to restore their royal line and re-partition the Visigothic kingdom through Amalaric, who incidentally, was more than just Alaric II's son; he was also the grandson of Theodoric the Great through his daughter Theodegotho.{{sfn|Heather|2013|p=93}} Amalaric reigned independently for five years.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=245}} Following Amalaric's assassination in 531, another Ostrogothic ruler, Theudis took his place.{{sfn|Carr|2004|p=421}} For the next seventeen years, Theudis held the Visigothic throne.{{sfn|Heather|2013|p=94}}\n\nSometime in 549, the Visigoth [[Athanagild]] sought military assistance from Justinian I and while this aide helped Athanagild win his wars, the Romans had much more in mind.{{sfn|Carr|2004|p=421}} Granada and southernmost [[Baetica]] were lost to representatives of the [[Byzantine Empire]] (to form the province of [[Spania]]) who had been invited in to help settle this Visigothic dynastic struggle, but who stayed on, as a hoped-for spearhead to a \"Reconquest\" of the far west envisaged by emperor [[Justinian I]].{{sfn|Roberts|1997|pp=82\u201385}} Imperial Roman armies took advantage of Visigothic rivalries and established a government at C\u00f3rdoba.{{sfn|Roberts|1997|p=82}}\n[[File:Hispania 700 AD.PNG|thumb|right|Visigothic Hispania and its regional divisions in 700, before the Muslim conquest]]\n\nThe last Arian Visigothic king, [[Liuvigild]], conquered most of the northern regions (Cantabria) in 574, the Suevic kingdom in 584, and regained part of the southern areas lost to the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]],{{sfn|Collins|2000|pp=51\u201353}} which King [[Suintila]] recovered in 624.{{sfn|Arce|1999|p=4}} The kingdom survived until 711, when King [[Roderic]] (Rodrigo) was killed while opposing an invasion from the south by the [[Umayyad Caliphate]] in the [[Battle of Guadalete]].

There is also a possible fifth city ascribed to them by a later Arabic source: ''Baiyara'' (perhaps modern [[Montoro]]). All of these cities were founded for military purposes and three of them in celebration of victory.

There were also deep sectarian splits among the Catholic population of the peninsula which contributed to the toleration of the Arian Visigoths on the peninsula. The Visigoths scorned to interfere among Catholics but were interested in decorum and public order.{{Efn|At least one high-ranking Visigoth, [[Zerezindo]], ''dux'' of Baetica, was a Catholic in the mid-6th century.}} King [[Liuvigild]] (568\u2013586), attempted to restore political unity between the Visigothic-Arian elite and the Hispano-Roman Nicene Catholic population through a doctrinal settlement of compromise on matters of faith, but this failed.{{sfn|Heather|2013|p=325}} Sources indicate that the Iberian Visigoths maintained their Christian Arianism, especially the Visigothic elite until the end of Liuvigild's reign.{{sfn|Wolfram|1997|pp=265\u2013269}} When Reccared I converted to Catholicism, he sought to unify the kingdom under a single faith.{{sfn|Frassetto|2003|p=304}}{{sfn|Mathisen|Sivan|1999|p=40}}\n\n[[File:Wisi San Pedro de la Nave e chapiteau a.jpg|thumb|left|Capital from the Visigothic church of [[San Pedro de la Nave]], [[province of Zamora]]]]\n\nWhen the Visigoths took over Spain, [[Jews]] constituted a large and ancient proportion of the population. Many were farmers, but they worked in a wide range of occupations, and were a major component of the urbanized population of the larger towns particularly of eastern Spain. During the period in which the Visigoths adhered to Arianism, the situation of the Jews seems to have remained relatively good.  Previous Roman and Byzantine law determined their status, and it already sharply discriminated against them, but royal jurisdiction was in any case quite limited: local lords and populations related to Jews as they saw fit. We read of rabbis being asked by non-Jews to bless their fields, for example.{{sfn|Graetz|1894|p=44}} Historian Jane Gerber relates that some of the Jews \"held ranking posts in the government or the army; others were recruited and organized for garrison service; still others continued to hold senatorial rank\".{{sfn|Gerber|1992|p=9}} In general, then, they were well respected and well-treated by the Visigothic kings, that is, until their transition from Arianism to Catholicism.{{sfn|Roth|1994|pp=35\u201340}}\n\nCatholic conversion across Visigothic society reduced much of the friction between their people and the native Spanish population.{{sfn|Waldman|Mason|2006|p=847}} One chief purpose of this conversion was to unify the realm under the Church, and one of the key complaints of the Church had long been that Jews had too much status, prosperity and influence. Local nobles relied on their Jewish and non-Jewish sectors of the population to enhance the local economy and the noble's independent power. Visigothic political structure had traditionally given extensive powers to local nobles (who even elected their kings), so the king was in many ways merely 'the first amongst equals,' and central authority was weak. The status of the Jews therefore impacted local aristocrats both symbolically and politically.\n\nKing Reccared convened the Third Council of Toledo to settle religious disputations related to the religious conversion from Arianism to Catholicism.{{sfn|Collins|1999|pp=211\u2013212}} The discriminatory laws passed at this Council seem not to have been universally enforced, however, as indicated by several more Councils of Toledo that repeated these laws and extended their stringency.  These entered canon law and became legal precedents in other parts of Europe as well.  The culmination of this process occurred under King Sisibut, who decreed a forced Christian conversion upon all Jews in Spain.{{sfn|Collins|2000|p=60}} This mandate apparently achieved only partial success: similar decrees were repeated by later kings as central power was consolidated. These laws either prescribed forcible baptism of the Jews or forbade circumcision, Jewish rites, and the observance of the Sabbath and other festivals. Throughout the seventh century, Jews were flogged, executed, had their property confiscated, were subjected to ruinous taxes, forbidden to trade and, at times, dragged to the baptismal font. Many were obliged to accept Christianity but continued privately to observe the Jewish religion and practices.{{sfn|Gonzalez-Salinero|1999|pp=140\u2013147}} The decree of 613 set off a century of torment for Spanish Jewry, which was only ended by the Muslim conquest.{{Efn|Cf. the extensive accounts of Visigothic Jewish history by Heinrich Graetz, ''History of the Jews'', Vol. 3 (Philadelphia: Jewish Publication Society of America, 1956 reprint [1894]), pp. 43\u201352 (on Sisibut, pp. 47\u201349); Salo W.

Cohen and D. Sorkin, ''The Oxford Handbook of Jewish Studies'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2002), p. 156.}}\n\nThe political aspects of the imposition of Church power cannot be ignored in these matters. With the conversion of the Visigothic kings to [[Chalcedonian Christianity]], the bishops increased their power, until, at the [[Fourth Council of Toledo]] in 633, they selected a king from among the royal family, a practice previously reserved for nobles. This was the same synod that declared that all Jews must be [[baptism|baptised]]. As far as the Visigoths were concerned, the time for religious pluralism \"was past\".{{sfn|Lim|1999|pp=209\u2013210}} By the end of the 7th century, Catholic conversion made the Visigoths less distinguishable from the indigenous Roman citizens of the Iberian peninsula; when the last Visigothic strongholds fell to the Muslim armies, whose subsequent invasions transformed Spain from the beginning of the 8th century, their Gothic identity faded.{{sfn|Collins|2000|pp=60\u201362}}\n\nIn the eighth through 11th centuries, the [[muladi|''muwallad'']] clan of the [[Banu Qasi]] claimed descent from the Visigothic [[Count Cassius]].{{sfn|Fletcher|2006|p=45}}\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Ancient Germanic culture}}\n*[[Romano-Germanic culture]]\n*[[Germanic peoples]]\n*[[Arianism]]\n*[[Thiufa]]\n\n==References==\n===Notes===\n{{notelist}}\n\n===Citations===\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{refbegin|30em|indent=yes}}\n* {{cite book| last=Arce |first=Javier| chapter=The City of Merida (Emerita) in the Vitas Patrum Emeritensium (Vith Century) | title=East and West, Modes of Communication: Proceedings of the First Plenary Conference at Merida  | editor1=Evangelos Chrysos | editor2=Ian Wood| volume=Vol. 5 [Transformation of the Roman World] | year = 1999| location = Leiden | publisher = Brill | isbn=978-9-00410-929-2|ref = harv}}\n*{{cite book | last=Burns | first=Thomas | year=2003 | title= Rome and the Barbarians, 100 B.C.\u2013A.D. 400 | place= Baltimore, MD | publisher= Johns Hopkins University Press | isbn= 978-0-80187-306-5 | ref = harv}}\n*{{cite book | last=Bury | first=J.

His other brother Engelmar was provost at Munster.\n\n==Life==\nFrom 1211 to 1212 Wilbrand was Canon of [[Hildesheim]], where he was ordered by [[Otto IV, Holy Roman Emperor]] to prepare the [[Fifth Crusade]] to the [[Holy Land]].
