Blood donors are generally healthier. People may be more interested in street tests if they may have been infected, or are more likely to get infected if they venture on the streets. Furthermore, the disease is rapidly evolving, out-dating many findings quickly. It typically takes some weeks to develop antibodies after infection. It typically takes some weeks to die after infection. It is widely recognized that deaths are often under-reported, for instance when only confirmed cases are counted. Deaths may be caused by or be attributed to underlying conditions or other causes.\n\nIn [[Castiglione d'Adda]], a small village of 4600 in northern Italy, 80 people (1.7% of the population) are already dead.

Other coronaviruses have been shown to be able to infect the brain via a [[Synapse|synaptic]] route to the [[respiratory centre]] in the [[medulla]], through [[mechanoreceptors]] like [[pulmonary stretch receptors]] and [[chemoreceptors]] (primarily [[central chemoreceptors]]) within the lungs. It is possible that dysfunction within the respiratory centre further worsens the [[ARDS]] seen in COVID-19 patients.

A second strategy, subunit vaccines, aims to create a vaccine that sensitises the immune system to certain subunits of the virus. In the case of SARS-CoV-2, such research focuses on the S-spike protein that helps the virus intrude the [[ACE2 enzyme]] receptor. A third strategy is that of the nucleic acid vaccines ([[DNA vaccination|DNA]] or [[RNA vaccines]], a novel technique for creating a vaccination).

Based on the [[Snow White|German fairy tale]] by the [[Brothers Grimm]], it is the first full-length [[Traditional animation|cel animated]] feature film and the earliest [[List of Walt Disney Animation Studios films|Disney animated feature film]]. The story was adapted by [[storyboard]] artists Dorothy Ann Blank, Richard Creedon, [[Merrill De Maris]], Otto Englander, [[Earl Hurd]], Dick Rickard, [[Ted Sears]] and Webb Smith. David Hand was the supervising director, while William Cottrell, [[Wilfred Jackson]], Larry Morey, Perce Pearce, and [[Ben Sharpsteen]] directed the film's individual sequences.\n\n''Snow White'' premiered at the [[Carthay Circle Theatre]] in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]] on December 21, 1937, followed by a nationwide release on February 4, 1938. It was a critical and commercial success, and with international earnings of $8 million during its initial release briefly held the record of highest-grossing [[sound film]] at the time. The popularity of the film has led to its being re-released theatrically many times, until its home video release in the 1990s. Adjusted for inflation, it is one of the [[List of highest-grossing films in Canada and the United States#Adjusted for ticket-price inflation|top-ten performers at the North American box office]] and the [[List of highest-grossing animated films|highest-grossing animated film]].\n\n''Snow White'' was nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Best Musical Score]] at the [[Academy Awards]] in 1938, and [[11th Academy Awards|the next year]], producer [[Walt Disney]] was awarded an honorary Oscar for the film. This award was unique, consisting of one normal-sized, plus seven miniature Oscar statuettes. They were presented to Disney by [[Shirley Temple]].<ref>[https://d23.com/disneys-special-academy-awards/ Disney's special Oscars]</ref>\n\nIn 1989, the United States [[Library of Congress]] deemed the film \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\" and selected it for preservation in the [[National Film Registry]]. The [[American Film Institute]] ranked it among [[AFI's 100 Years... 100 Movies|the 100 greatest American films]], and also named the film as [[AFI's 10 Top 10|the greatest American animated film of all time]] in 2008. Disney's take on the fairy tale has had a significant cultural impact, resulting in popular [[Amusement park|theme park]] attractions, a [[video game]], and a [[Broadway theatre|Broadway musical]].\n\n== Plot ==\n<!-- Per WP:FilmPlot, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 and 700 words. Current count is 631 words. -->\n[[Snow White (Disney character)|Snow White]] is a lonely princess living with her stepmother, a vain [[Evil Queen (Disney)|Queen]]. The Queen worries that Snow White will be more beautiful than her, so she forces Snow White to work as a [[scullery maid]] and asks her [[Magic Mirror (Snow White)|Magic Mirror]] daily \"who is the fairest one of all\". For years the mirror always answers that the Queen is, pleasing her.\n\nOne day, the Magic Mirror informs the Queen that Snow White is now \"the fairest\" in the land; on that same day, Snow White meets and falls in love with a prince who overhears her singing. The jealous Queen orders her [[Huntsman (Snow White)|Huntsman]] to take Snow White into the forest and kill her. She further demands that the huntsman return with Snow White's heart in a jeweled box as proof of the deed. However, the Huntsman cannot bring himself to kill Snow White. He tearfully begs for her forgiveness, revealing the Queen wants her dead and urges her to flee into the woods and never look back. Lost and frightened, the princess is befriended by woodland creatures who lead her to a cottage deep in the woods. Finding seven small chairs in the cottage's dining room, Snow White assumes the cottage is the untidy home of seven orphaned children.\n\nIn reality, the cottage belongs to seven adult [[dwarf (mythology)|dwarf]]s\u2014named Doc, Grumpy, Happy, Sleepy, Bashful, Sneezy, and Dopey\u2014who work in a nearby mine. Returning home, they are alarmed to find their cottage clean and suspect that an intruder has invaded their home. The dwarfs find Snow White upstairs, asleep across three of their beds. Snow White awakes to find the dwarfs at her bedside and introduces herself, and all of the dwarfs eventually welcome her into their home after she offers to clean and cook for them. Snow White keeps house for the dwarfs while they mine for jewels during the day, and at night they all sing, play music and dance.\n\nMeanwhile, the Queen discovers that Snow White is still alive when the mirror again answers that Snow White is the fairest in the land and reveals that the heart in the jeweled box is actually that of a pig. Using a potion to disguise herself as an old [[hag]], the Queen creates a poisoned apple that will put whoever eats it into the \"Sleeping Death\", a curse she learns can only be broken by \"love's first kiss\", but is certain Snow White will be buried alive. While the Queen goes to the cottage while the dwarfs are away, the animals are wary of her and rush off to find the dwarfs. Faking a potential heart attack, the Queen tricks Snow White into bringing her into the cottage to rest. The Queen fools Snow White into biting into the poisoned apple under the pretense that it is a magic apple that grants wishes. As Snow White falls asleep, the Queen proclaims that she is now the fairest of the land. The dwarfs return with the animals as the Queen leaves the cottage and give chase, trapping her on a cliff. She tries to roll a boulder over them, but before she can do so, lightning strikes the cliff, causing her to fall to her death.\n\nThe dwarfs return to their cottage and find Snow White seemingly dead, being kept in a deathlike slumber by the poison. Unwilling to bury her out of sight in the ground, they instead place her in a glass coffin trimmed with gold in a clearing in the forest. Together with the woodland creatures, they keep watch over her. A year later, the prince from the beginning of the movie learns of her eternal sleep and visits her coffin. Saddened by her apparent death, he kisses her, which breaks the spell and awakens her. The dwarfs and animals all rejoice as the Prince takes Snow White to his castle.\n\n== Cast ==\n[[File:Walt Disney Snow white 1937 trailer screenshot (13).jpg|thumb|[[Walt Disney]] introduces each of the Seven Dwarfs in a scene from the original 1937 ''Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs'' theatrical trailer.]]\n\n* [[Adriana Caselotti]] as [[Snow White (Disney character)|Snow White]]: Snow White is a young princess.

''[[Disney A to Z]]'', Third Edition, (2006), page 33.</ref> and as such Walt Disney had to fight to get the film produced. Both his brother and business partner [[Roy O. Disney|Roy Disney]] and his wife [[Lillian Disney|Lillian]] attempted to talk him out of it,<ref name=\"disneysfolly\" /> and the Hollywood movie industry referred to the film derisively as \"Disney's Folly\" while it was in production. He had to mortgage his house to help finance the film's production, which eventually ran up a total cost of $1,488,422.74, a massive sum for a feature film in 1937.{{sfn|Barrier|1999|p = 229}}\n\n=== Story development ===\nOn August 9, 1934, twenty-one pages of notes\u2014entitled \"Snowwhite suggestions\"\u2014were compiled by staff writer Richard Creedon, suggesting the principal characters, as well as situations and 'gags' for the story. As Disney had stated at the very beginning of the project, the main attraction of the story for him was the Seven Dwarfs, and their possibilities for \"screwiness\" and \"gags\"; the three story meetings held in October and attended by Disney, Creedon, Larry Morey, Albert Hurter, [[Ted Sears]] and [[Pinto Colvig]] were dominated by such subjects. At this point, Disney felt that the story should begin with Snow White's discovery of the Cottage of the Seven Dwarfs.{{sfn|Barrier|1999|pp = 125\u2013126}} Walt Disney had suggested from the beginning that each of the dwarfs, whose names and personalities are not stated in the original fairy tale, could have individual personalities. The dwarfs names were chosen from a pool of about fifty potentials, including Jumpy, Deafy, Dizzey, Hickey, Wheezy, Baldy, Gabby, Nifty, Sniffy, Swift, Lazy, Puffy, Stuffy, Tubby, Shorty, and Burpy.<ref name=\"Bob\">Bob Thomas, ''Disney's Art of Animation: From Mickey Mouse to Beauty and the Beast'' (Hyperion, New York, 1991) {{ISBN|1-56282-899-1}}</ref> The seven finalists were chosen through a process of elimination. The leader of the dwarfs, required to be pompous, self-important and bumbling, was named Doc; others were named for their distinguishing character traits. At the end of the October story meetings, however, only Doc, Grumpy, Bashful, Sleepy and Happy of the final seven were named; at this point, Sneezy and Dopey were replaced by 'Jumpy' and an unnamed seventh dwarf.{{sfn|Barrier|1999|p = 229}}\n\nAlong with a focus on the characterizations and comedic possibilities of the dwarfs, Creedon's eighteen-page outline of the story written from the October meetings, featured a continuous flow of gags as well as the Queen's attempt to kill Snow White with a poisoned comb, an element taken from the Grimms' original story. After persuading Snow White to use the comb, the disguised Queen would have escaped alive, but the dwarfs would have arrived in time to remove it. After the failure of the comb, the Queen was to have the Prince captured and taken to her dungeon, where she would have come to him (story sketches show this event both with the Queen and the Witch) and used magic to bring the dungeon's skeletons to life, making them dance for him and identifying one skeleton as \"Prince Oswald\", an example of the more humorous atmosphere of this original story treatment.{{sfn|Barrier|1999|pp = 125\u2013126}} It is written in story notes that the Queen has such magical power only in her own domain, the castle. With the Prince refusing to marry her, the Queen leaves him to his death (one sketch shows the Prince trapped in a subterranean chamber filling with water)<ref name=\"Before\">John Canemaker, \"Before the Animation Begins: The Life and Times of Disney inspirational Sketch Artists\" (Hyperion, New York, 1999) {{ISBN|0-7868-6152-5}}</ref> as she makes her way to the dwarfs' cottage with the poisoned apple. The forest animals were to help the Prince escape the Queen's minions and find his horse. The Prince was to ride to the cottage to save Snow White but took the wrong road (despite warnings from the forest animals and his horse, whom he, unlike Snow White, could not understand). He, therefore, would not have arrived in time to save her from the Queen but would have been able to save her with love's first kiss. This plot was not used in the final film, though many sketches of the scene in the dungeon were made by Ferdinand Hovarth.\n\nOther examples of the more comical nature of the story at this point include suggestions for a \"fat, batty, cartoon type, self-satisfied\" Queen.{{sfn|Barrier|1999|pp = 125\u2013126}} The Prince was also more of a clown, and was to serenade Snow White in a more comical fashion. Walt Disney encouraged all staff at the studio to contribute to the story, offering five dollars for every 'gag'; such gags included the dwarfs' noses popping over the foot of the bed when they first meet Snow White.<ref name=\"Life\" />\n\nDisney became concerned that such a comical approach would lessen the plausibility of the characters and, sensing that more time was needed for the development of the Queen, advised in an outline circulated on November 6 that attention be paid exclusively to \"scenes in which only Snow White, the Dwarfs, and their bird and animal friends appear\". The names and personalities of the dwarfs, however, were still \"open to change\". A meeting of November 16 resulted in another outline entitled 'Dwarfs Discover Snowwhite', which introduced the character of Dopey,{{sfn|Barrier|1999|pp = 125\u2013126}} who would ultimately prove to be the most successful and popular of the dwarf characterisations.<ref name=\"Bob\" /> For the rest of 1934 Disney further developed the story by himself, finding a dilemma in the characterization of the Queen, who he felt could no longer be \"fat\" and \"batty\", but a \"stately beautiful type\", a possibility already brought up in previous story meetings. Disney did not focus on the project again until the autumn of 1935. It is thought that he may have doubted his, and his studio's ability, and that his trip to Europe that summer restored his confidence. At this point, Disney and his writers focused on the scenes in which Snow White and the dwarfs are introduced to the audience and each other. He laid out the likely assignments for everyone working on the film in a memorandum of November 25, 1935, and had decided on the personalities of the individual dwarfs.{{sfn|Barrier|1999|pp = 125\u2013126}}\n\nIt had first been thought that the dwarfs would be the main focus of the story, and many sequences were written for the seven characters. However, at a certain point, it was decided that the main thrust of the story was provided by the relationship between the Queen and Snow White.<ref name=\"Life\">Frank Thomas and Ollie Johnston, ''The Illusion of Life: Disney Animation'' (Disney Editions, Italy, 1981) {{ISBN|0-7868-6070-7}}</ref> For this reason, several sequences featuring the dwarfs were cut from the film. The first, which was animated in its entirety before being cut, showed Doc and Grumpy arguing about whether Snow White should stay with them. Another, also completely animated, would have shown the dwarfs eating soup noisily and messily; Snow White unsuccessfully attempts to teach them how to eat 'like gentlemen'. A partially animated sequence involved the dwarfs holding a \"lodge meeting\" in which they try to think of a gift for Snow White; this was to be followed by the elaborate 'bed building sequence', in which the dwarfs and the forest animals construct and carve a bed for the princess. This also was cut, as it was thought to slow down the movement of the story.<ref name=\"Life\" /> The soup-eating and bed-building sequences were animated by [[Ward Kimball]], who was sufficiently discouraged by their removal to consider leaving the studio, however Disney persuaded him to stay by promoting him to supervising animator of [[Jiminy Cricket]] in his next feature ''[[Pinocchio (1940 film)|Pinocchio]]'' (1940).<ref name=\"Nine\">John Canemaker, \"Walt Disney's Nine Old Men and the Art of Animation\" (Disney Editions, United States, 2001) {{ISBN|0-7868-6496-6}}</ref>\n\n=== Animation ===\n[[File:Snow white 1937 trailer screenshot (2).jpg|thumb|left|The famous \"[[Heigh-Ho]]\" sequence from ''Snow White'' was animated by [[Shamus Culhane]].]]\n\nThe primary authority on the design of the film was concept artist Albert Hurter. All designs used in the film, from characters' appearances to the look of the rocks in the background, had to meet Hurter's approval before being finalized.<ref name=\"Before\" /> Two other concept artists&nbsp;\u2014 Ferdinand Hovarth and [[Gustaf Tenggren]]&nbsp;\u2014 also contributed to the visual style of ''Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs''. Hovarth developed a number of dark concepts for the film, although many other designs he developed were ultimately rejected by the Disney team as less easily translated into animation than Hurter's. Tenggren was used as a color stylist and to determine the staging and atmosphere of many of the scenes in the film, as his style borrowed from the likes of [[Arthur Rackham]] and [[John Bauer (illustrator)|John Bauer]] and thus possessed the European illustration quality that [[Walt Disney]] sought. He also designed the posters for the film and illustrated the press book. However, Hovarth didn't receive a credit for the film. Other artists to work on the film included [[Joe Grant]], whose most significant contribution was the design for [[Queen (Snow White)|the Queen]]'s Witch form.<ref name=\"Before\" />\n\n{{quote box| width  = 22em| align  = right| quote  = [[Donald W.

Though there was no teacher, Babbit had recruited a model to pose for him and his fellow animators as they drew. These \"classes\" were held weekly; each week, more animators would come. After three weeks, Walt Disney called Babbit to his office and offered to provide the supplies, working space and models required if the sessions were moved to the studio. Babbit ran the sessions for a month until animator [[Hardie Gramatky]] suggested that they recruit [[Donald W. Graham|Don Graham]]; the art teacher from the Chouinard Institute taught his first class at the studio on November 15, 1932, and was joined by Phil Dike a few weeks later.{{sfn|Barrier|1999|pp = 125\u2013126}} These classes were principally concerned with human anatomy and movement, though instruction later included action analysis, animal anatomy and acting.<ref name=\"Girveau\">Bruno Girveau (editor), ''Once Upon a Time&nbsp;\u2014 Walt Disney: The Sources of inspiration for the Disney Studios'' (Prestel, London, 2006) {{ISBN|978-3-7913-3770-8}}</ref>\n\n{{quote box\n| width  = 22em\n| align  = left\n| quote  = The first duty of the cartoon is not to picture or duplicate real action or things as they actually happen\u2014but to give a caricature of life and action\u2014to picture on the screen things that have run thru the imagination of the audience to bring to life dream-fantasies and imaginative fancies that we have all thought of during our lives or have had pictured to us in various forms during our lives [...] I definitely feel that we cannot do the fantastic things, based on the real, unless we first know the real.

Graham often screened Disney shorts and, along with the animators, provided critique featuring both strengths and weaknesses. For example, Graham criticised Babbit's animation of Abner the mouse in ''[[The Country Cousin]]'' as \"taking a few of the obvious actions of a drunk without coordinating the rest of the body\", while praising it for maintaining its humour without getting \"dirty or mean or vulgar. The country mouse is always having a good time\".<ref name=\"Girveau\" />\n\nVery few of the animators at the Disney studio had had artistic training (most had been newspaper cartoonists); among these few was [[Grim Natwick]], who had trained in Europe. The animator's success in designing and animating [[Betty Boop]] for [[Fleischer Studios]] showed an understanding of human female anatomy, and when Walt Disney hired Natwick he was given female characters to animate almost exclusively. Attempts to animate Persephone, the female lead of ''The Goddess of Spring'', had proved largely unsuccessful; Natwick's animation of the heroine in ''Cookie Carnival'' showed greater promise, and the animator was eventually given the task of animating Snow White herself. Though live action footage of Snow White, the Prince and the Queen was shot as reference for the animators, the artists' animators disapproved of [[rotoscoping]], considering it to hinder the production of effective caricature. None of Babbit's animation of the Queen was rotoscoped;<ref>Robin Allan, Walt Disney and Europe (Indiana University Press, Indiana, 1999) {{ISBN|0-253-21353-3}}</ref> despite Graham and Natwick's objections, however, some scenes of Snow White and the Prince were directly traced from the live-action footage.<ref name=\"Girveau\" />\n\nIt proved difficult to add color to Snow White's and the queen's face. Eventually they found a red dye that worked, and which was added with a small piece of cotton wrapped around a tipple pencil on each individual cel. [[Helen Ogger]], an employee at the ink department, was also an animator and decided to use the same system used in animation. The method was so time-consuming that it was never used again on the same scale. It was also used to a smaller degree in ''Pinocchio'' and ''Fantasia'', but after Ogger left the studio in 1941 there was nobody with the same skills who could replace her.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20000510124524/http://www.animationartist.com/columns/DJohnson/Not_Rouge/not_rouge.html Not Rouge, Mr. Thomas!]</ref>\n\nThe studio's new [[multiplane camera]] gave a three-dimensional feeling in many sequences and was also used to give a rotating effect in the scene where the Queen transforms into a witch.\n\n=== Music ===\n[[File:Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (Original Theatrical Trailer 2) 1937 (La Blancaneu).ogv|thumb|Theatrical trailer featuring the song \"Heigh-Ho\".]]\n{{main|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (soundtrack)}}\n\nThe songs in ''Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs'' were composed by [[Frank Churchill]] and [[Larry Morey]]. [[Paul Smith (film and television composer)|Paul J. Smith]] and [[Leigh Harline]] composed the incidental music score. Well-known songs from ''Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs'' include \"[[Heigh-Ho]]\", \"[[Some Day My Prince Will Come]]\", and \"[[Whistle While You Work]]\". Since Disney did not have its own music publishing company at the time, the publishing rights for the music and songs were administered through [[Bourne Co. Music Publishers]], which continues to hold these rights. In later years, the studio was able to acquire back the rights to the music from many of the other films, but not ''Snow White''. ''Snow White'' became the first American film to have a [[soundtrack album]], released in conjunction with the feature film. Before ''Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs'', a film soundtrack recording was unheard of and of little value to a movie studio.\n\n=== Cinematic influences ===\nAt this time, Disney also encouraged his staff to see a variety of films. These ranged from the mainstream, such as MGM's ''[[Romeo and Juliet (1936 film)|Romeo and Juliet]]'' (1936)\u2014to which Disney made direct reference in a story meeting pertaining to the scene in which Snow White lies in her glass coffin\u2014to the more obscure, including European silent cinema. ''Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs'', as well as the two Disney films to follow it, were also influenced by such German expressionist films as ''[[Nosferatu]]'' (1922) and ''[[The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari]]'' (1919), both of which were recommended by Disney to his staff. This influence is particularly evident in the scenes of Snow White fleeing through the forest and the Queen's transformation into the Witch. The latter scene was also inspired by ''[[Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (1931 film)|Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde]]'' (1931), to which Disney made specific reference in story meetings.<ref name=\"Girveau\" />\n\n== Release ==\n\n=== Original theatrical run ===\n''Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs'' premiered at the [[Carthay Circle Theatre]] on December 21, 1937, to a wildly receptive audience, many of whom were the same naysayers who had dubbed the film \"Disney's Folly\".{{sfn|Barrier|1999|p = 229}} The film received a standing ovation at its completion<ref>{{cite book|last=Kinni|first=Theodore|title=Be Our Guest: Revised and Updated Edition|publisher=Disney Electronic Content|isbn=978-1-4231-4014-6|page=59|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=90mwv8Ag8lUC&pg=PA59&dq=standing+ovation+%22snow+white%22#v=onepage&q=standing%20ovation%20%22snow%20white%22&f=false|accessdate=January 5, 2013|date=December 16, 2011}}</ref> from an audience that included [[Judy Garland]], [[Marlene Dietrich]] and [[Charles Laughton]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Cousins |first=Mark |title=The Story of Film |year=2006 |publisher=Pavilion |isbn=978-1-86205-760-9 |page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=G2yMRux\u20133C0C&pg=PA166 166]}}</ref> Six days later, Walt Disney and the seven dwarfs appeared on the cover of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine.<ref>{{cite journal|journal=TIME|title=The Seven Dwarfs and Walt Disney|date=December 27, 1937|volume=XXX|issue=26|url=http://www.time.com/time/covers/0,16641,19371227,00.html|accessdate=January 5, 2013|location=[New York NY]}}</ref> The ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' said, \"Thank you very much, Mr. Disney\".<ref>{{cite news|last=Nugent|first=Frank S.|title=The Music Hall Presents Walt Disney's Delightful Fantasy|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=EE05E7DF173FE070BC4C52DFB7668383629EDE|accessdate=January 5, 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=January 14, 1938|location=New York NY}}</ref> The American entertainment trade publication ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' observed that \"[so] perfect is the illusion, so tender the romance and fantasy, so emotional are certain portions when the acting of the characters strikes a depth comparable to the sincerity of human players, that the film approaches real greatness.\"<ref>{{cite news|last=Flynn, Sr.|first=John C.|title=Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs|url=https://www.variety.com/review/VE1117794991/|accessdate=January 5, 2013|newspaper=Variety|date=December 28, 1937|location=Los Angeles CA}}</ref>\n\nFollowing successful exclusive runs at [[Radio City Music Hall]] in [[New York City]] and a theater in [[Miami]] in January 1938,{{sfn|Barrier|1999|p = 229}} [[RKO Radio Pictures]] put the film into general release on February 4.

Based on the [[Snow White|German fairy tale]] by the [[Brothers Grimm]], it is the first full-length [[Traditional animation|cel animated]] feature film and the earliest [[List of Walt Disney Animation Studios films|Disney animated feature film]]. The story was adapted by [[storyboard]] artists Dorothy Ann Blank, Richard Creedon, [[Merrill De Maris]], Otto Englander, [[Earl Hurd]], Dick Rickard, [[Ted Sears]] and Webb Smith. David Hand was the supervising director, while William Cottrell, [[Wilfred Jackson]], Larry Morey, Perce Pearce, and [[Ben Sharpsteen]] directed the film's individual sequences.\n\n''Snow White'' premiered at the [[Carthay Circle Theatre]] in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]] on December 21, 1937, followed by a nationwide release on February 4, 1938. It was a critical and commercial success, and with international earnings of $8 million during its initial release briefly held the record of highest-grossing [[sound film]] at the time. The popularity of the film has led to its being re-released theatrically many times, until its home video release in the 1990s. Adjusted for inflation, it is one of the [[List of highest-grossing films in Canada and the United States#Adjusted for ticket-price inflation|top-ten performers at the North American box office]] and the [[List of highest-grossing animated films|highest-grossing animated film]].\n\n''Snow White'' was nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Best Musical Score]] at the [[Academy Awards]] in 1938, and [[11th Academy Awards|the next year]], producer [[Walt Disney]] was awarded an honorary Oscar for the film. This award was unique, consisting of one normal-sized, plus seven miniature Oscar statuettes. They were presented to Disney by [[Shirley Temple]].<ref>[https://d23.com/disneys-special-academy-awards/ Disney's special Oscars]</ref>\n\nIn 1989, the United States [[Library of Congress]] deemed the film \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\" and selected it for preservation in the [[National Film Registry]]. The [[American Film Institute]] ranked it among [[AFI's 100 Years... 100 Movies|the 100 greatest American films]], and also named the film as [[AFI's 10 Top 10|the greatest American animated film of all time]] in 2008. Disney's take on the fairy tale has had a significant cultural impact, resulting in popular [[Amusement park|theme park]] attractions, a [[video game]], and a [[Broadway theatre|Broadway musical]].\n\n== Plot ==\n<!-- Per WP:FilmPlot, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 and 700 words. Current count is 631 words. -->\n[[Snow White (Disney character)|Snow White]] is a lonely princess living with her stepmother, a vain [[Evil Queen (Disney)|Queen]]. The Queen worries that Snow White will be more beautiful than her, so she forces Snow White to work as a [[scullery maid]] and asks her [[Magic Mirror (Snow White)|Magic Mirror]] daily \"who is the fairest one of all\". For years the mirror always answers that the Queen is, pleasing her.\n\nOne day, the Magic Mirror informs the Queen that Snow White is now \"the fairest\" in the land; on that same day, Snow White meets and falls in love with a prince who overhears her singing. The jealous Queen orders her [[Huntsman (Snow White)|Huntsman]] to take Snow White into the forest and kill her. She further demands that the huntsman return with Snow White's heart in a jeweled box as proof of the deed. However, the Huntsman cannot bring himself to kill Snow White. He tearfully begs for her forgiveness, revealing the Queen wants her dead and urges her to flee into the woods and never look back. Lost and frightened, the princess is befriended by woodland creatures who lead her to a cottage deep in the woods. Finding seven small chairs in the cottage's dining room, Snow White assumes the cottage is the untidy home of seven orphaned children.\n\nIn reality, the cottage belongs to seven adult [[dwarf (mythology)|dwarf]]s\u2014named Doc, Grumpy, Happy, Sleepy, Bashful, Sneezy, and Dopey\u2014who work in a nearby mine. Returning home, they are alarmed to find their cottage clean and suspect that an intruder has invaded their home. The dwarfs find Snow White upstairs, asleep across three of their beds. Snow White awakes to find the dwarfs at her bedside and introduces herself, and all of the dwarfs eventually welcome her into their home after she offers to clean and cook for them. Snow White keeps house for the dwarfs while they mine for jewels during the day, and at night they all sing, play music and dance.\n\nMeanwhile, the Queen discovers that Snow White is still alive when the mirror again answers that Snow White is the fairest in the land and reveals that the heart in the jeweled box is actually that of a pig. Using a potion to disguise herself as an old [[hag]], the Queen creates a poisoned apple that will put whoever eats it into the \"Sleeping Death\", a curse she learns can only be broken by \"love's first kiss\", but is certain Snow White will be buried alive. While the Queen goes to the cottage while the dwarfs are away, the animals are wary of her and rush off to find the dwarfs. Faking a potential heart attack, the Queen tricks Snow White into bringing her into the cottage to rest. The Queen fools Snow White into biting into the poisoned apple under the pretense that it is a magic apple that grants wishes. As Snow White falls asleep, the Queen proclaims that she is now the fairest of the land. The dwarfs return with the animals as the Queen leaves the cottage and give chase, trapping her on a cliff. She tries to roll a boulder over them, but before she can do so, lightning strikes the cliff, causing her to fall to her death.\n\nThe dwarfs return to their cottage and find Snow White seemingly dead, being kept in a deathlike slumber by the poison. Unwilling to bury her out of sight in the ground, they instead place her in a glass coffin trimmed with gold in a clearing in the forest. Together with the woodland creatures, they keep watch over her. A year later, the prince from the beginning of the movie learns of her eternal sleep and visits her coffin. Saddened by her apparent death, he kisses her, which breaks the spell and awakens her. The dwarfs and animals all rejoice as the Prince takes Snow White to his castle.\n\n== Cast ==\n[[File:Walt Disney Snow white 1937 trailer screenshot (13).jpg|thumb|[[Walt Disney]] introduces each of the Seven Dwarfs in a scene from the original 1937 ''Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs'' theatrical trailer.]]\n\n* [[Adriana Caselotti]] as [[Snow White (Disney character)|Snow White]]: Snow White is a young princess.

''[[Disney A to Z]]'', Third Edition, (2006), page 33.</ref> and as such Walt Disney had to fight to get the film produced. Both his brother and business partner [[Roy O. Disney|Roy Disney]] and his wife [[Lillian Disney|Lillian]] attempted to talk him out of it,<ref name=\"disneysfolly\" /> and the Hollywood movie industry referred to the film derisively as \"Disney's Folly\" while it was in production. He had to mortgage his house to help finance the film's production, which eventually ran up a total cost of $1,488,422.74, a massive sum for a feature film in 1937.{{sfn|Barrier|1999|p = 229}}\n\n=== Story development ===\nOn August 9, 1934, twenty-one pages of notes\u2014entitled \"Snowwhite suggestions\"\u2014were compiled by staff writer Richard Creedon, suggesting the principal characters, as well as situations and 'gags' for the story. As Disney had stated at the very beginning of the project, the main attraction of the story for him was the Seven Dwarfs, and their possibilities for \"screwiness\" and \"gags\"; the three story meetings held in October and attended by Disney, Creedon, Larry Morey, Albert Hurter, [[Ted Sears]] and [[Pinto Colvig]] were dominated by such subjects. At this point, Disney felt that the story should begin with Snow White's discovery of the Cottage of the Seven Dwarfs.{{sfn|Barrier|1999|pp = 125\u2013126}} Walt Disney had suggested from the beginning that each of the dwarfs, whose names and personalities are not stated in the original fairy tale, could have individual personalities. The dwarfs names were chosen from a pool of about fifty potentials, including Jumpy, Deafy, Dizzey, Hickey, Wheezy, Baldy, Gabby, Nifty, Sniffy, Swift, Lazy, Puffy, Stuffy, Tubby, Shorty, and Burpy.<ref name=\"Bob\">Bob Thomas, ''Disney's Art of Animation: From Mickey Mouse to Beauty and the Beast'' (Hyperion, New York, 1991) {{ISBN|1-56282-899-1}}</ref> The seven finalists were chosen through a process of elimination. The leader of the dwarfs, required to be pompous, self-important and bumbling, was named Doc; others were named for their distinguishing character traits. At the end of the October story meetings, however, only Doc, Grumpy, Bashful, Sleepy and Happy of the final seven were named; at this point, Sneezy and Dopey were replaced by 'Jumpy' and an unnamed seventh dwarf.{{sfn|Barrier|1999|p = 229}}\n\nAlong with a focus on the characterizations and comedic possibilities of the dwarfs, Creedon's eighteen-page outline of the story written from the October meetings, featured a continuous flow of gags as well as the Queen's attempt to kill Snow White with a poisoned comb, an element taken from the Grimms' original story. After persuading Snow White to use the comb, the disguised Queen would have escaped alive, but the dwarfs would have arrived in time to remove it. After the failure of the comb, the Queen was to have the Prince captured and taken to her dungeon, where she would have come to him (story sketches show this event both with the Queen and the Witch) and used magic to bring the dungeon's skeletons to life, making them dance for him and identifying one skeleton as \"Prince Oswald\", an example of the more humorous atmosphere of this original story treatment.{{sfn|Barrier|1999|pp = 125\u2013126}} It is written in story notes that the Queen has such magical power only in her own domain, the castle. With the Prince refusing to marry her, the Queen leaves him to his death (one sketch shows the Prince trapped in a subterranean chamber filling with water)<ref name=\"Before\">John Canemaker, \"Before the Animation Begins: The Life and Times of Disney inspirational Sketch Artists\" (Hyperion, New York, 1999) {{ISBN|0-7868-6152-5}}</ref> as she makes her way to the dwarfs' cottage with the poisoned apple. The forest animals were to help the Prince escape the Queen's minions and find his horse. The Prince was to ride to the cottage to save Snow White but took the wrong road (despite warnings from the forest animals and his horse, whom he, unlike Snow White, could not understand). He, therefore, would not have arrived in time to save her from the Queen but would have been able to save her with love's first kiss. This plot was not used in the final film, though many sketches of the scene in the dungeon were made by Ferdinand Hovarth.\n\nOther examples of the more comical nature of the story at this point include suggestions for a \"fat, batty, cartoon type, self-satisfied\" Queen.{{sfn|Barrier|1999|pp = 125\u2013126}} The Prince was also more of a clown, and was to serenade Snow White in a more comical fashion. Walt Disney encouraged all staff at the studio to contribute to the story, offering five dollars for every 'gag'; such gags included the dwarfs' noses popping over the foot of the bed when they first meet Snow White.<ref name=\"Life\" />\n\nDisney became concerned that such a comical approach would lessen the plausibility of the characters and, sensing that more time was needed for the development of the Queen, advised in an outline circulated on November 6 that attention be paid exclusively to \"scenes in which only Snow White, the Dwarfs, and their bird and animal friends appear\". The names and personalities of the dwarfs, however, were still \"open to change\". A meeting of November 16 resulted in another outline entitled 'Dwarfs Discover Snowwhite', which introduced the character of Dopey,{{sfn|Barrier|1999|pp = 125\u2013126}} who would ultimately prove to be the most successful and popular of the dwarf characterisations.<ref name=\"Bob\" /> For the rest of 1934 Disney further developed the story by himself, finding a dilemma in the characterization of the Queen, who he felt could no longer be \"fat\" and \"batty\", but a \"stately beautiful type\", a possibility already brought up in previous story meetings. Disney did not focus on the project again until the autumn of 1935. It is thought that he may have doubted his, and his studio's ability, and that his trip to Europe that summer restored his confidence. At this point, Disney and his writers focused on the scenes in which Snow White and the dwarfs are introduced to the audience and each other. He laid out the likely assignments for everyone working on the film in a memorandum of November 25, 1935, and had decided on the personalities of the individual dwarfs.{{sfn|Barrier|1999|pp = 125\u2013126}}\n\nIt had first been thought that the dwarfs would be the main focus of the story, and many sequences were written for the seven characters. However, at a certain point, it was decided that the main thrust of the story was provided by the relationship between the Queen and Snow White.<ref name=\"Life\">Frank Thomas and Ollie Johnston, ''The Illusion of Life: Disney Animation'' (Disney Editions, Italy, 1981) {{ISBN|0-7868-6070-7}}</ref> For this reason, several sequences featuring the dwarfs were cut from the film. The first, which was animated in its entirety before being cut, showed Doc and Grumpy arguing about whether Snow White should stay with them. Another, also completely animated, would have shown the dwarfs eating soup noisily and messily; Snow White unsuccessfully attempts to teach them how to eat 'like gentlemen'. A partially animated sequence involved the dwarfs holding a \"lodge meeting\" in which they try to think of a gift for Snow White; this was to be followed by the elaborate 'bed building sequence', in which the dwarfs and the forest animals construct and carve a bed for the princess. This also was cut, as it was thought to slow down the movement of the story.<ref name=\"Life\" /> The soup-eating and bed-building sequences were animated by [[Ward Kimball]], who was sufficiently discouraged by their removal to consider leaving the studio, however Disney persuaded him to stay by promoting him to supervising animator of [[Jiminy Cricket]] in his next feature ''[[Pinocchio (1940 film)|Pinocchio]]'' (1940).<ref name=\"Nine\">John Canemaker, \"Walt Disney's Nine Old Men and the Art of Animation\" (Disney Editions, United States, 2001) {{ISBN|0-7868-6496-6}}</ref>\n\n=== Animation ===\n[[File:Snow white 1937 trailer screenshot (2).jpg|thumb|left|The famous \"[[Heigh-Ho]]\" sequence from ''Snow White'' was animated by [[Shamus Culhane]].]]\n\nThe primary authority on the design of the film was concept artist Albert Hurter. All designs used in the film, from characters' appearances to the look of the rocks in the background, had to meet Hurter's approval before being finalized.<ref name=\"Before\" /> Two other concept artists&nbsp;\u2014 Ferdinand Hovarth and [[Gustaf Tenggren]]&nbsp;\u2014 also contributed to the visual style of ''Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs''. Hovarth developed a number of dark concepts for the film, although many other designs he developed were ultimately rejected by the Disney team as less easily translated into animation than Hurter's. Tenggren was used as a color stylist and to determine the staging and atmosphere of many of the scenes in the film, as his style borrowed from the likes of [[Arthur Rackham]] and [[John Bauer (illustrator)|John Bauer]] and thus possessed the European illustration quality that [[Walt Disney]] sought. He also designed the posters for the film and illustrated the press book. However, Hovarth didn't receive a credit for the film. Other artists to work on the film included [[Joe Grant]], whose most significant contribution was the design for [[Queen (Snow White)|the Queen]]'s Witch form.<ref name=\"Before\" />\n\n{{quote box| width  = 22em| align  = right| quote  = [[Donald W.

Though there was no teacher, Babbit had recruited a model to pose for him and his fellow animators as they drew. These \"classes\" were held weekly; each week, more animators would come. After three weeks, Walt Disney called Babbit to his office and offered to provide the supplies, working space and models required if the sessions were moved to the studio. Babbit ran the sessions for a month until animator [[Hardie Gramatky]] suggested that they recruit [[Donald W. Graham|Don Graham]]; the art teacher from the Chouinard Institute taught his first class at the studio on November 15, 1932, and was joined by Phil Dike a few weeks later.{{sfn|Barrier|1999|pp = 125\u2013126}} These classes were principally concerned with human anatomy and movement, though instruction later included action analysis, animal anatomy and acting.<ref name=\"Girveau\">Bruno Girveau (editor), ''Once Upon a Time&nbsp;\u2014 Walt Disney: The Sources of inspiration for the Disney Studios'' (Prestel, London, 2006) {{ISBN|978-3-7913-3770-8}}</ref>\n\n{{quote box\n| width  = 22em\n| align  = left\n| quote  = The first duty of the cartoon is not to picture or duplicate real action or things as they actually happen\u2014but to give a caricature of life and action\u2014to picture on the screen things that have run thru the imagination of the audience to bring to life dream-fantasies and imaginative fancies that we have all thought of during our lives or have had pictured to us in various forms during our lives [...] I definitely feel that we cannot do the fantastic things, based on the real, unless we first know the real.

Graham often screened Disney shorts and, along with the animators, provided critique featuring both strengths and weaknesses. For example, Graham criticised Babbit's animation of Abner the mouse in ''[[The Country Cousin]]'' as \"taking a few of the obvious actions of a drunk without coordinating the rest of the body\", while praising it for maintaining its humour without getting \"dirty or mean or vulgar. The country mouse is always having a good time\".<ref name=\"Girveau\" />\n\nVery few of the animators at the Disney studio had had artistic training (most had been newspaper cartoonists); among these few was [[Grim Natwick]], who had trained in Europe. The animator's success in designing and animating [[Betty Boop]] for [[Fleischer Studios]] showed an understanding of human female anatomy, and when Walt Disney hired Natwick he was given female characters to animate almost exclusively. Attempts to animate Persephone, the female lead of ''The Goddess of Spring'', had proved largely unsuccessful; Natwick's animation of the heroine in ''Cookie Carnival'' showed greater promise, and the animator was eventually given the task of animating Snow White herself. Though live action footage of Snow White, the Prince and the Queen was shot as reference for the animators, the artists' animators disapproved of [[rotoscoping]], considering it to hinder the production of effective caricature. None of Babbit's animation of the Queen was rotoscoped;<ref>Robin Allan, Walt Disney and Europe (Indiana University Press, Indiana, 1999) {{ISBN|0-253-21353-3}}</ref> despite Graham and Natwick's objections, however, some scenes of Snow White and the Prince were directly traced from the live-action footage.<ref name=\"Girveau\" />\n\nIt proved difficult to add color to Snow White's and the queen's face. Eventually they found a red dye that worked, and which was added with a small piece of cotton wrapped around a tipple pencil on each individual cel. [[Helen Ogger]], an employee at the ink department, was also an animator and decided to use the same system used in animation. The method was so time-consuming that it was never used again on the same scale. It was also used to a smaller degree in ''Pinocchio'' and ''Fantasia'', but after Ogger left the studio in 1941 there was nobody with the same skills who could replace her.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20000510124524/http://www.animationartist.com/columns/DJohnson/Not_Rouge/not_rouge.html Not Rouge, Mr. Thomas!]</ref>\n\nThe studio's new [[multiplane camera]] gave a three-dimensional feeling in many sequences and was also used to give a rotating effect in the scene where the Queen transforms into a witch.\n\n=== Music ===\n[[File:Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (Original Theatrical Trailer 2) 1937 (La Blancaneu).ogv|thumb|Theatrical trailer featuring the song \"Heigh-Ho\".]]\n{{main|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (soundtrack)}}\n\nThe songs in ''Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs'' were composed by [[Frank Churchill]] and [[Larry Morey]]. [[Paul Smith (film and television composer)|Paul J. Smith]] and [[Leigh Harline]] composed the incidental music score. Well-known songs from ''Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs'' include \"[[Heigh-Ho]]\", \"[[Some Day My Prince Will Come]]\", and \"[[Whistle While You Work]]\". Since Disney did not have its own music publishing company at the time, the publishing rights for the music and songs were administered through [[Bourne Co. Music Publishers]], which continues to hold these rights. In later years, the studio was able to acquire back the rights to the music from many of the other films, but not ''Snow White''. ''Snow White'' became the first American film to have a [[soundtrack album]], released in conjunction with the feature film. Before ''Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs'', a film soundtrack recording was unheard of and of little value to a movie studio.\n\n=== Cinematic influences ===\nAt this time, Disney also encouraged his staff to see a variety of films. These ranged from the mainstream, such as MGM's ''[[Romeo and Juliet (1936 film)|Romeo and Juliet]]'' (1936)\u2014to which Disney made direct reference in a story meeting pertaining to the scene in which Snow White lies in her glass coffin\u2014to the more obscure, including European silent cinema. ''Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs'', as well as the two Disney films to follow it, were also influenced by such German expressionist films as ''[[Nosferatu]]'' (1922) and ''[[The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari]]'' (1919), both of which were recommended by Disney to his staff. This influence is particularly evident in the scenes of Snow White fleeing through the forest and the Queen's transformation into the Witch. The latter scene was also inspired by ''[[Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (1931 film)|Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde]]'' (1931), to which Disney made specific reference in story meetings.<ref name=\"Girveau\" />\n\n== Release ==\n\n=== Original theatrical run ===\n''Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs'' premiered at the [[Carthay Circle Theatre]] on December 21, 1937, to a wildly receptive audience, many of whom were the same naysayers who had dubbed the film \"Disney's Folly\".{{sfn|Barrier|1999|p = 229}} The film received a standing ovation at its completion<ref>{{cite book|last=Kinni|first=Theodore|title=Be Our Guest: Revised and Updated Edition|publisher=Disney Electronic Content|isbn=978-1-4231-4014-6|page=59|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=90mwv8Ag8lUC&pg=PA59&dq=standing+ovation+%22snow+white%22#v=onepage&q=standing%20ovation%20%22snow%20white%22&f=false|accessdate=January 5, 2013|date=December 16, 2011}}</ref> from an audience that included [[Judy Garland]], [[Marlene Dietrich]] and [[Charles Laughton]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Cousins |first=Mark |title=The Story of Film |year=2006 |publisher=Pavilion |isbn=978-1-86205-760-9 |page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=G2yMRux\u20133C0C&pg=PA166 166]}}</ref> Six days later, Walt Disney and the seven dwarfs appeared on the cover of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine.<ref>{{cite journal|journal=TIME|title=The Seven Dwarfs and Walt Disney|date=December 27, 1937|volume=XXX|issue=26|url=http://www.time.com/time/covers/0,16641,19371227,00.html|accessdate=January 5, 2013|location=[New York NY]}}</ref> The ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' said, \"Thank you very much, Mr. Disney\".<ref>{{cite news|last=Nugent|first=Frank S.|title=The Music Hall Presents Walt Disney's Delightful Fantasy|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=EE05E7DF173FE070BC4C52DFB7668383629EDE|accessdate=January 5, 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=January 14, 1938|location=New York NY}}</ref> The American entertainment trade publication ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' observed that \"[so] perfect is the illusion, so tender the romance and fantasy, so emotional are certain portions when the acting of the characters strikes a depth comparable to the sincerity of human players, that the film approaches real greatness.\"<ref>{{cite news|last=Flynn, Sr.|first=John C.|title=Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs|url=https://www.variety.com/review/VE1117794991/|accessdate=January 5, 2013|newspaper=Variety|date=December 28, 1937|location=Los Angeles CA}}</ref>\n\nFollowing successful exclusive runs at [[Radio City Music Hall]] in [[New York City]] and a theater in [[Miami]] in January 1938,{{sfn|Barrier|1999|p = 229}} [[RKO Radio Pictures]] put the film into general release on February 4.

In the arena of live action, the fantasy television series ''[[Once Upon a Time (TV series)|Once Upon a Time]]'' (produced by Disney-owned [[ABC Studios]]) regularly includes live-action interpretations of these characters including Snow White, the Prince, the Evil Queen and Grumpy.\n\nAn animated television series featuring a new version of the seven dwarfs titled ''[[The 7D]]'' premiered on ''[[Disney XD]]'' on July 7, 2014, and ended its run on November 5, 2016.

The Rising was launched by [[Irish republicanism|Irish republicans]] to end British rule in Ireland and establish an independent [[Irish Republic]] while the United Kingdom was fighting the [[First World War]]. It was the most significant [[List of Irish uprisings|uprising in Ireland]] since the [[Irish Rebellion of 1798|rebellion of 1798]] and the first armed action of the [[Irish revolutionary period]]. Sixteen of the Rising's leaders were executed in May 1916, but the insurrection, the nature of the executions, and subsequent political developments ultimately contributed to an increase in popular support for Irish independence.\n\nOrganised by a seven-man Military Council of the [[Irish Republican Brotherhood]], the Rising began on Easter Monday, 24 April 1916 and lasted for six days.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=_RhCAAAAIAAJ&dq=%22military+council%22+irb&q=%22military+council%22+&pgis=1#search_anchor ''Leaders and Men of the Easter Rising: Dublin 1916''] Francis X. Martin 1967 p105</ref> Members of the [[Irish Volunteers]], led by schoolmaster and Irish language activist [[Patrick Pearse]], joined by the smaller [[Irish Citizen Army]] of [[James Connolly]] and 200 women of [[Cumann na mBan]], seized strategically important buildings in [[Dublin]] and [[Proclamation of the Irish Republic|proclaimed an Irish Republic]]. The [[British Army]] brought in thousands of reinforcements as well as artillery and a gunboat. There was street fighting on the routes into the city centre, where the rebels slowed the British advance and inflicted many casualties. Elsewhere in Dublin, the fighting mainly consisted of sniping and long-range gun battles. The main rebel positions were gradually surrounded and bombarded with artillery. There were isolated actions in other parts of Ireland; Volunteer leader [[Eoin MacNeill]] had issued a countermand in a bid to halt the Rising, which greatly reduced the number of rebels who mobilised.\n\nWith much greater numbers and heavier weapons, the British Army suppressed the Rising. Pearse agreed to an unconditional surrender on Saturday 29 April, although sporadic fighting continued briefly. After the surrender the country remained under [[martial law]]. About 3,500 people were taken prisoner by the British and 1,800 of them were sent to internment camps or prisons in Britain. Most of the leaders of the Rising were executed following courts-martial. The Rising brought [[Physical force Irish republicanism|physical force republicanism]] back to the forefront of Irish politics, which for nearly fifty years had been dominated by constitutional nationalism. Opposition to the British reaction to the Rising contributed to changes in public opinion and the move toward independence, as shown in the [[1918 Irish general election|December 1918 election]] which was won by the [[Sinn F\u00e9in]] party, which convened the [[First D\u00e1il]] and declared independence.\n\nOf the 485 people killed in the Easter Rising: 54 percent were civilians, 30 percent were British military and police and 16 percent were Irish rebels. More than 2,600 were wounded. Many of the civilians were killed or wounded by British artillery and machine guns or were mistaken for rebels. Others were caught in the crossfire in the crowded city. The shelling and resulting fires left parts of central Dublin in ruins. Until this day the Irish fight for their freedom, still the rid the country of the brits.

In 1886, the [[Irish Parliamentary Party]] (IPP) under [[Charles Stewart Parnell]] succeeded in having the [[Irish Government Bill 1886|First Home Rule Bill]] introduced in the British parliament, but it was defeated. The [[Irish Government Bill 1893|Second Home Rule Bill]] of 1893 was passed by the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] but rejected by the [[House of Lords]].\n\nAfter the fall of Parnell, younger and more radical nationalists became disillusioned with parliamentary politics and turned toward more extreme forms of separatism. The [[Gaelic Athletic Association]], the [[Conradh na Gaeilge|Gaelic League]] and the [[Gaelic revival|cultural revival]] under [[W. B. Yeats]] and [[Lady Augusta Gregory]], together with the new political thinking of [[Arthur Griffith]] expressed in his newspaper ''[[Sinn F\u00e9in Printing & Publishing Company|Sinn F\u00e9in]]'' and organisations such as the National Council and the Sinn F\u00e9in League, led many Irish people to identify with the idea of an independent [[Gaels|Gaelic]] Ireland.<ref>MacDonagh, Oliver, pp. 72\u201374</ref><ref>Feeney, p. 22</ref> This was sometimes referred to by the generic term ''Sinn F\u00e9in''.<ref>Feeney, p. 37</ref>\n\nThe [[Government of Ireland Act 1914|Third Home Rule Bill]] was introduced by British Prime Minister [[H. H. Asquith]] in 1912. [[Unionism in Ireland|Unionists]], who were Protestant, opposed it, as they did not want to be ruled by a Catholic-dominated Irish government. Led by [[Edward Carson, Baron Carson|Sir Edward Carson]] and [[James Craig, 1st Viscount Craigavon|James Craig]], they formed the [[Ulster Volunteers]] (UVF) in January 1913.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nli.ie/1916/exhibition/en/content/stagesetters/index.pdf|title=Those who set the stage|work=The 1916 Rising: Personalities and Perspectives|publisher=National Library of Ireland|accessdate=7 December 2009}}</ref> In response, Irish nationalists formed a rival paramilitary group, the [[Irish Volunteers]], in November 1913. The [[Irish Republican Brotherhood]] (IRB) was a driving force behind the Irish Volunteers and attempted to control it. Its leader was [[Eoin MacNeill]], who was not an IRB member.<ref>Foy and Barton, pp. 7\u20138</ref> The Irish Volunteers' stated goal was \"to secure and to maintain the rights and liberties common to all the people of Ireland\".

The Military Council was able to promote its own policies and personnel independently of both the Volunteer Executive and the IRB Executive.

IRB President [[Denis McCullough]] and prominent IRB member [[Bulmer Hobson]] held similar views.<ref>Townshend, p. 94</ref> The Military Council kept its plans secret, so as to prevent the British authorities learning of the plans, and to thwart those within the organisation who might try to stop the rising. IRB members held officer rank in the Volunteers throughout the country and took their orders from the Military Council, not from MacNeill.<ref>Macardle, p. 119</ref>\n\nShortly after the outbreak of World War I, [[Roger Casement]] and [[Clan na Gael]] leader [[John Devoy]] met the German ambassador to the United States, [[Johann Heinrich von Bernstorff]], to discuss German backing for an uprising. Casement went to Germany and began negotiations with the German government and military. He persuaded the Germans to announce their support for Irish independence in November 1914.<ref>Foy and Barton, p. 25</ref> Casement also attempted to recruit an [[Irish Brigade (World War I)|Irish Brigade]], made up of Irish [[World War I prisoners of war in Germany|prisoners of war]], which would be armed and sent to Ireland to join the uprising.<ref>Townshend, p. 104</ref><ref>Foy and Barton, p. 105</ref> However, only 56 men volunteered. Plunkett joined Casement in Germany the following year. Together, Plunkett and Casement presented a plan (the 'Ireland Report') in which a German [[Expeditionary warfare|expeditionary force]] would land on the west coast of Ireland, while a rising in Dublin diverted the British forces so that the Germans, with the help of local Volunteers, could secure the line of the [[River Shannon]], before advancing on the capital.<ref>McNally and Dennis, p. 30</ref> The German military rejected the plan, but agreed to ship arms and ammunition to the Volunteers.<ref>Foy and Barton, pp. 25\u201328</ref>\n\n[[James Connolly]]\u2014head of the [[Irish Citizen Army]] (ICA), a group of armed socialist trade union men and women\u2014was unaware of the IRB's plans, and threatened to start a rebellion on his own if other parties failed to act. If they had done it alone, the IRB and the Volunteers would possibly have come to their aid;<ref>[[Eoin Neeson]], ''Myths from Easter 1916'', p. ?</ref> however, the IRB leaders met with Connolly in January 1916 and convinced him to join forces with them. They agreed that they would launch a rising together at Easter and made Connolly the sixth member of the Military Council. [[Thomas MacDonagh]] would later become the seventh and final member.\n\nThe death of the old [[Fenian]] leader [[Jeremiah O'Donovan Rossa]] in [[New York City|New York]] in August 1915 was an opportunity to mount a spectacular demonstration. His body was sent to Ireland for burial in [[Glasnevin Cemetery]], with the Volunteers in charge of arrangements. Huge crowds lined the route and gathered at the graveside. Pearse made a dramatic funeral oration, a rallying call to republicans, which ended with the words \"[[Ireland unfree shall never be at peace]]\".<ref>Kennedy, pp. 199\u2013200</ref>\n\n==Build-up to Easter Week==\n[[File:Signatories of the Proclamation of the Republic.png|thumb|The signatories of the Proclamation: Tom Clarke, Se\u00e1n MacDiarmada, Thomas MacDonagh, Patrick Pearse, \u00c9amonn Ceannt, James Connolly, Joseph Plunkett]]\nIn early April, Pearse issued orders to the Irish Volunteers for three days of \"parades and manoeuvres\" beginning on Easter Sunday. He had the authority to do this, as the Volunteers' Director of Organisation. The idea was that IRB members within the organisation would know these were orders to begin the rising, while men such as MacNeill and the British authorities would take it at face value.\n\nOn 9 April, the [[Imperial German Navy|German Navy]] dispatched the [[SS Libau]] for [[County Kerry]], disguised as the Norwegian ship ''Aud''.<ref>Caulfield, Max, p. 29</ref> It was loaded with 20,000 rifles, one million rounds of ammunition, and explosives. Casement also left for Ireland aboard the German submarine ''[[SM U-19 (Germany)|U-19]]''. He was disappointed with the level of support offered by the Germans and he intended to stop or at least postpone the rising.<ref>Foy and Barton, p.56</ref>\n\nOn Wednesday 19 April, Alderman [[Thomas Kelly (Sinn F\u00e9in politician)|Tom Kelly]], a Sinn F\u00e9in member of Dublin Corporation, read out at a meeting of the Corporation a document purportedly leaked from Dublin Castle, detailing plans by the British authorities to shortly arrest leaders of the Irish Volunteers, Sinn F\u00e9in and the Gaelic League, and occupy their premises.<ref>Townshend, pp. 131\u2013132</ref> Although the British authorities said the \"Castle Document\" was fake, MacNeill ordered the Volunteers to prepare to resist.<ref>Foy and Barton, p. 47</ref> Unbeknownst to MacNeill, the document had been [[Forgery|forged]] by the Military Council to persuade moderates of the need for their planned uprising. It was an edited version of a real document outlining British plans in the event of conscription.<ref>McGarry, p. 117</ref> That same day, the Military Council informed senior Volunteer officers that the rising would begin on Easter Sunday. However, it chose not to inform the rank-and-file, or moderates such as MacNeill, until the last minute.<ref>Foy and Barton, p. 48</ref>\n\nThe following day, MacNeill got wind that a rising was about to be launched and threatened to do everything he could to prevent it, short of informing the British.<ref>Foy and Barton, p. 52</ref> MacNeill was briefly persuaded to go along with some sort of action when Mac Diarmada revealed to him that a German arms shipment was about to land in [[County Kerry]]. MacNeill believed that when the British learned of the shipment they would immediately suppress the Volunteers, thus the Volunteers would be justified in taking defensive action, including the planned manoeuvres.<ref>Michael Tierney, ''Eoin MacNeill'', pp. 199, 214</ref>\n\nThe ''Aud'' and the ''U-19'' reached the coast of Kerry on Good Friday, 21 April. This was earlier than the Volunteers expected and so none were there to meet the vessels. The [[Royal Navy]] had known about the arms shipment and intercepted the ''Aud'', prompting the captain to [[Scuttling|scuttle]] the ship. Furthermore, Casement was captured shortly after he landed at [[Banna Strand]].<ref>Foy and Barton, pp. 57\u201358</ref>\n\nWhen MacNeill learned from Vol. [[Patrick Whelan]] that the arms shipment had been lost, he reverted to his original position. With the support of other leaders of like mind, notably Bulmer Hobson and [[The O'Rahilly]], he issued a countermand to all Volunteers, cancelling all actions for Sunday. This countermanding order was relayed to Volunteer officers and printed in the Sunday morning newspapers. It succeeded only in delaying the rising for a day, although it greatly reduced the number of Volunteers who turned out.\n\n[[Naval Intelligence Division|British Naval Intelligence]] had been aware of the arms shipment, Casement's return, and the Easter date for the rising through radio messages between Germany and its embassy in the United States that were intercepted by the Royal Navy and deciphered in [[Room 40]] of the Admiralty.<ref>\u00d3 Broin, p. 138</ref> The information was passed to the [[Under-Secretary for Ireland]], Sir [[Matthew Nathan]], on 17 April, but without revealing its source, and Nathan was doubtful about its accuracy.<ref>\u00d3 Broin, p. 79</ref> When news reached Dublin of the capture of the ''Aud'' and the arrest of Casement, Nathan conferred with the [[Lord Lieutenant of Ireland|Lord Lieutenant]], [[Ivor Guest, 1st Viscount Wimborne|Lord Wimborne]]. Nathan proposed to raid [[Liberty Hall]], headquarters of the Citizen Army, and Volunteer properties at Father Matthew Park and at [[Kimmage]], but Wimborne insisted on wholesale arrests of the leaders. It was decided to postpone action until after Easter Monday, and in the meantime Nathan telegraphed the [[Chief Secretary for Ireland|Chief Secretary]], [[Augustine Birrell]], in London seeking his approval.<ref>\u00d3 Broin, pp. 81\u201387</ref> By the time Birrell cabled his reply authorising the action, at noon on Monday 24 April 1916, the Rising had already begun.<ref>\u00d3 Broin, p. 88</ref>\n\nOn the morning of Easter Sunday, 23 April, the Military Council met at Liberty Hall to discuss what to do in light of MacNeill's countermanding order. They decided that the Rising would go ahead the following day, Easter Monday, and that the Irish Volunteers and Irish Citizen Army would go into action as the 'Army of the Irish Republic'. They elected Pearse as president of the Irish Republic, and also as Commander-in-Chief of the army; Connolly became Commandant of the Dublin Brigade.<ref>Foy and Barton, p. 66</ref> Messengers were then sent to all units informing them of the new orders.<ref name=\"rte-timeline\">[http://www.rte.ie/centuryireland/index.php/articles/chronology-of-the-easter-rising Chronology of the Easter Rising].

This was due to MacNeill's countermanding order, and the fact that the new orders had been sent so soon beforehand. However, several hundred Volunteers joined the Rising after it began.<ref name=\"McGarry, p. 129\">McGarry, p. 129</ref>\n\nShortly before midday, the rebels began to seize important sites in central Dublin. The rebels' plan was to hold Dublin city centre. This was a large, oval-shaped area bounded by two canals: the [[Grand Canal (Ireland)|Grand]] to the south and the [[Royal Canal|Royal]] to the north, with the [[River Liffey]] running through the middle. On the southern and western edges of this district were five British Army barracks. Most of the rebels' positions had been chosen to defend against counter-attacks from these barracks.<ref>Dorney, John. ''The Story of the Easter Rising, 1916''. Green Lamp, 2010. p. 33</ref> The rebels took the positions with ease. Civilians were evacuated and policemen were ejected or taken prisoner.<ref>McGarry, p. 133</ref> Windows and doors were barricaded, food and supplies were secured, and first aid posts were set up. Barricades were erected on the streets to hinder British Army movement.<ref>McGarry, p. 135</ref>\n\nA joint force of about 400 Volunteers and Citizen Army gathered at Liberty Hall under the command of Commandant James Connolly. This was the headquarters battalion, and it also included Commander-in-Chief Patrick Pearse, as well as [[Tom Clarke (Irish republican)|Tom Clarke]], [[Se\u00e1n Mac Diarmada|Se\u00e1n MacDermott]] and [[Joseph Mary Plunkett|Joseph Plunkett]].<ref>McNally and Dennis, p. 41</ref> They marched to the [[General Post Office, Dublin|General Post Office]] (GPO) on [[O'Connell Street]], Dublin's main thoroughfare, occupied the building and hoisted two republican flags. Pearse stood outside and read the [[Proclamation of the Irish Republic]].<ref>Foy and Barton, pp. 192, 195</ref> Copies of the Proclamation were also pasted on walls and handed out to bystanders by Volunteers and newsboys.<ref>McGarry, p. 134</ref> The GPO would be the rebels' headquarters for most of the Rising. Volunteers from the GPO also occupied other buildings on the street, including buildings overlooking [[O'Connell Bridge]]. They took over a [[Wireless telegraphy|wireless telegraph]] station and sent out a [[Radio broadcasting|radio broadcast]] in [[Morse code]], announcing that an Irish Republic had been declared. This was the first radio broadcast in Ireland.<ref>McGee, John.

The 1st battalion, under [[Edward Daly (Irish revolutionary)|Edward 'Ned' Daly]], occupied the [[Four Courts]] and surrounding buildings, while a company under [[Se\u00e1n Heuston]] occupied the [[Mendicity Institution]], across the River Liffey from the Four Courts. The 2nd battalion, under [[Thomas MacDonagh]], occupied [[Jacob's]] biscuit factory. The 3rd battalion, under [[\u00c9amon de Valera]], occupied [[Boland's Mill]] and surrounding buildings. The 4th battalion, under [[\u00c9amonn Ceannt]], occupied the [[House of Industry (Dublin)|South Dublin Union]] and the distillery on [[Marrowbone Lane]]. From each of these garrisons, small units of rebels established [[Outpost (military)|outposts]] in the surrounding area.<ref>McNally and Dennis, pp. 39\u201340</ref>\n\nThe rebels also attempted to cut transport and communication links. As well as erecting roadblocks, they took control of various bridges and cut telephone and telegraph wires. [[Dublin Pearse railway station|Westland Row]] and [[Harcourt Street railway station|Harcourt Street]] railway stations were occupied, though the latter only briefly. The railway line was cut at [[Fairview, Dublin|Fairview]] and the line was damaged by bombs at [[Dublin Connolly railway station|Amiens Street]], [[Dublin Broadstone railway station|Broadstone]], [[Dublin Heuston railway station|Kingsbridge]] and [[Lansdowne Road railway station|Lansdowne Road]].<ref>McKenna, Joseph.

The goal was to seize weapons and blow up the ammunition store to signal that the Rising had begun. They seized weapons and planted explosives, but the blast was not big enough to be heard across the city.<ref>Caulfield, Max, pp. 48\u201350</ref> The 23-year-old son of the fort's commander was fatally shot when he ran to raise the alarm.<ref>[http://www.historyireland.com/20th-century-contemporary-history/children-of-the-revolution/ \"Children of the Revolution\"].

As they approached the gate a lone and unarmed police sentry, James O'Brien, attempted to stop them and was shot dead by Connolly. According to some accounts, he was the first casualty of the Rising. The rebels overpowered the soldiers in the guardroom, but failed to press further. The British Army's chief intelligence officer, Major Ivon Price, fired on the rebels while the [[Under-Secretary for Ireland]], Sir [[Matthew Nathan]], helped shut the castle gates. Unbeknownst to the rebels, the Castle was lightly guarded and could have been taken with ease.<ref>Foy and Barton, pp. 84\u201385</ref> The rebels instead laid siege to the Castle from City Hall.

Two troops of British cavalry were sent to investigate what was happening. They took fire and casualties from rebel forces at the GPO and at the Four Courts.<ref>Caulfield, Max, pp. 54\u201355</ref><ref name=\"Coffey, Thomas M. pp. 38, 44\">Coffey, Thomas M.

On Mount Street, a group of [[Volunteer Training Corps (World War I)|Volunteer Training Corps]] men stumbled upon the rebel position and four were killed before they reached [[Beggars Bush Barracks]].<ref>O'Brien, ''Blood on the Streets, the Battle for Mount Street'', pp. 22\u201323</ref>\n\nThe only substantial combat of the first day of the Rising took place at the South Dublin Union where a piquet from the [[Royal Irish Regiment (1684\u20131922)|Royal Irish Regiment]] encountered an outpost of \u00c9amonn Ceannt's force at the northwestern corner of the South Dublin Union. The British troops, after taking some casualties, managed to regroup and launch several assaults on the position before they forced their way inside and the small rebel force in the tin huts at the eastern end of the Union surrendered.<ref>Caulfield, Max, pp. 76\u201380</ref> However, the Union complex as a whole remained in rebel hands. A nurse in uniform, Margaret Keogh, was shot dead by British soldiers at the Union.

The British commander, Lowe, worked slowly, unsure of the size of the force he was up against, and with only 1,269 troops in the city when he arrived from the [[Curragh Camp]] in the early hours of Tuesday 25 April. City Hall was taken from the rebel unit that had attacked Dublin Castle on Tuesday morning.<ref>Coogan 2001, p. 107</ref><ref name=\"Townshend p191\">Townshend, p. 191</ref>\n\nIn the early hours of Tuesday, 120 British soldiers, with machine-guns, occupied two buildings overlooking St Stephen's Green: the [[Shelbourne Hotel]] and United Services Club.<ref>Caulfield, p. 122</ref> At dawn they opened fire on the Citizen Army occupying the green. The rebels returned fire, but were forced to retreat to the [[Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland|Royal College of Surgeons]] building.

In the northeast, British troops left Amiens Street railway station in an armoured train, to secure and repair a section of damaged tracks. They were attacked by rebels who had taken up position at [[Annesley Bridge]]. After a two-hour battle, the British were forced to retreat and several soldiers were captured.<ref name=caulfield145>Caulfield, pp. 145\u2013146</ref> At [[Phibsborough]], in the northwest, rebels had occupied buildings and erected barricades at junctions on the North Circular Road.

After a fierce firefight, the rebels withdrew.<ref name=caulfield145/>\n\nThat afternoon Pearse walked out into O'Connell Street with a small escort and stood in front of Nelson's Pillar.

As a result, during the following week, the British were able to bring in thousands of reinforcements from Britain and from their garrisons at [[the Curragh]] and [[Belfast]]. By the end of the week, British strength stood at over 16,000 men.<ref name=\"Townshend p191\"/><ref>McGarry, pp. 167\u2013169</ref> Their firepower was provided by field artillery which they positioned on the [[Northside, Dublin|Northside]] of the city at Phibsborough and at [[Trinity College, Dublin|Trinity College]], and by the patrol vessel ''[[Irish patrol vessel Muirch\u00fa|Helga]]'', which sailed up the [[River Liffey|Liffey]], having been summoned from the port at Kingstown.

One Volunteer in the GPO recalled, \"we did practically no shooting as there was no target\".<ref>McGarry, p. 175</ref> However, where the insurgents dominated the routes by which the British tried to funnel reinforcements into the city, there was fierce fighting.\n\nAt 5:25PM Volunteers [[Eamon Martin (Irish Republican)|Eamon Martin]], Garry Holohan, Robert Beggs, Sean Cody, Dinny O'Callaghan, Charles Shelley, Peadar Breslin and five others attempted to occupy Broadstone railway station on Church Street, the attack was unsuccessful and Martin was injured.<ref name=\"rte-timeline\"/><ref>Witness Statement by Eamon Martin to Bureau of Military History, 1951</ref><ref>Witness Statement of Sean Cody to Bureau of Military History, 1954</ref><ref>Witness Statement of Nicholas Kaftan to Bureau of Military History</ref><ref>Witness Statement of Charles Shelley to Bureau of Military History, 1953</ref>\n\nOn Wednesday morning, hundreds of British troops encircled the Mendicity Institute, which was occupied by 26 Volunteers under Se\u00e1n Heuston. British troops advanced on the building, supported by snipers and machine gun fire, but the Volunteers put up stiff resistance. Eventually, the troops got close enough to hurl grenades into the building, some of which the rebels threw back. Exhausted and almost out of ammunition, Heuston's men became the first rebel position to surrender. Heuston had been ordered to hold his position for a few hours, to delay the British, but had held on for three days.<ref>O'Brien, Paul.

Heavy fighting occurred at the rebel-held positions around the [[Grand Canal of Ireland|Grand Canal]] as these troops advanced towards Dublin. More than 1,000 [[Sherwood Foresters]] were repeatedly caught in a cross-fire trying to cross the canal at Mount Street Bridge.

The South Dublin Union was a large complex of buildings and there was vicious fighting around and inside the buildings. [[Cathal Brugha]], a rebel officer, distinguished himself in this action and was badly wounded. By the end of the week, the British had taken some of the buildings in the Union, but others remained in rebel hands.<ref>Caulfield, pp. 225\u2013228</ref> British troops also took casualties in unsuccessful frontal assaults on the Marrowbone Lane Distillery.<ref>Ryan, pp. 128\u2013133</ref>\n\n[[File:Birth of the Irish Republic.jpg|thumb|''Birth of the Irish Republic'' by [[Walter Paget]], depicting the GPO during the shelling]]\nThe third major scene of fighting during the week was in the area of North King Street, north of the Four Courts. The rebels had established strong outposts in the area, occupying numerous small buildings and barricading the streets. From Thursday to Saturday, the British made repeated attempts to take the area, in what was some of the fiercest fighting of the Rising. As the troops moved in, the rebels continually opened fire from windows and behind chimneys and barricades. At one point, a platoon led by Major Sheppard made a [[Charge (warfare)|bayonet charge]] on one of the barricades, but was cut down by rebel fire.

Although they did not receive as much attention as the executions, they sparked outrage among the Irish public and were raised by Irish MPs in Parliament.\n\nOne incident was the 'Portobello killings'. On Tuesday 25 April, Dubliner [[Francis Sheehy-Skeffington]], a pacifist nationalist activist, had been arrested by British soldiers. Captain John Bowen-Colthurst then took him with a British raiding party as a hostage and [[human shield]]. On Rathmines Road he stopped a boy named James Coade, whom he shot dead. His troops then destroyed a tobacconist's shop with grenades and seized journalists Thomas Dickson and Patrick MacIntyre. The next morning, Colthurst had Skeffington and the two journalists shot by firing squad in [[Cathal Brugha Barracks|Portobello Barracks]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Bacon|first1=Bryan|title=A Terrible Duty: the Madness of Captain Bowen-Colthurst|date=2015|publisher=Thena Press}}</ref> The bodies were then buried there. Later that day he shot a Labour Party councillor, [[Richard O'Carroll]]. When Major Sir [[Francis Vane]] learned of the killings he telephoned his superiors in Dublin Castle, but no action was taken. Vane informed [[Herbert Kitchener]], who told General [[John Maxwell (British Army officer)|Maxwell]] to arrest Colthurst, but Maxwell refused. Colthurst was eventually arrested and court-martialled in June. He was found guilty of murder but insane, and detained for twenty months at [[Broadmoor Hospital|Broadmoor]]. Public and political pressure led to a public inquiry, which reached similar conclusions. Major Vane was discharged \"owing to his action in the Skeffington murder case\".<ref>McGarry, p. 186</ref><ref>Townshend, p. 193</ref><ref>Caulfield, Max, p. 187</ref><ref>Yeates, P\u00e1draig.

On the night of 28\u201329 April, British soldiers of the [[South Staffordshire Regiment]], under Colonel Henry Taylor, had burst into houses on North King Street and killed 15 male civilians whom they accused of being rebels. The soldiers shot or bayoneted the victims, then secretly buried some of them in cellars or back yards after robbing them. The area saw some of the fiercest fighting of the Rising and the British had taken heavy casualties for little gain. General Maxwell attempted to excuse the killings and argued that the rebels were ultimately responsible. He claimed that \"the rebels wore no uniform\" and that the people of North King Street were rebel sympathisers. Maxwell concluded that such incidents \"are absolutely unavoidable in such a business as this\" and that \"under the circumstance the troops [...] behaved with the greatest restraint\". A private brief, prepared for the Prime Minister, said the soldiers \"had orders not to take any prisoners\" but took it to mean they were to shoot any suspected rebel. The City Coroner's inquest found that soldiers had killed \"unarmed and unoffending\" residents. The military court of inquiry ruled that no specific soldiers could be held responsible, and no action was taken.<ref>McGarry, p. 187</ref><ref>Caulfield, pp. 338\u2013340</ref><ref>Coogan {{which|date=September 2016}}, pp. 152\u2013155</ref><ref>Townshend, pp. 293\u2013294</ref><ref>Dorney, John.

It began hearings on 18 May under the chairmanship of [[Charles Hardinge, 1st Baron Hardinge of Penshurst|Lord Hardinge of Penshurst]]. The Commission heard evidence from Sir Matthew Nathan, Augustine Birrell, Lord Wimborne, Sir [[Neville Francis Fitzgerald Chamberlain|Neville Chamberlain]] (Inspector-General of the [[Royal Irish Constabulary]]), General [[Lovick Friend]], Major Ivor Price of Military Intelligence and others.<ref>\u00d3 Broin, Leon, ''Dublin Castle & the 1916 Rising'' pp. 153\u2013159</ref> The report, published on 26 June, was critical of the Dublin administration, saying that \"Ireland for several years had been administered on the principle that it was safer and more expedient to leave the law in abeyance if collision with any faction of the Irish people could thereby be avoided.\"<ref>Townshend p. 297</ref> Birrell and Nathan had resigned immediately after the Rising.

The thing had been sprung on them so suddenly they were unable to take sides.\"<ref>Stephens p. 57</ref>\n\nThere was great hostility towards the Volunteers in some parts of the city. Historian [[Keith Jeffery]] noted that most of the opposition came from people whose relatives were in the British Army and who depended on their army allowances.<ref>Kennedy, p. 286</ref> Those most openly hostile to the Volunteers were the \"separation women\" (so-called because they were paid \"separation money\" by the British government), whose husbands and sons were fighting in the British Army in the First World War. There was also hostility from [[Unionism in Ireland|unionists]].<ref>Foy and Barton, pp. 203\u2013209</ref> Supporters of the [[Irish Parliamentary Party]] also felt the rebellion was a betrayal of their party.<ref>\"The loyalists spoke with an air of contempt, 'the troops will settle the matter in an hour or two, these pro-Germans will run away...' The Redmondites were more bitter, 'I hope they'll all be hanged' ... 'Shooting's too good for them. Trying to stir up trouble for us all.'\" [[Ernie O'Malley]], ''On Another Man's Wound'', p. 60.</ref> When occupying positions in the South Dublin Union and Jacob's factory, the rebels got involved in physical confrontations with civilians who tried to tear down the rebel barricades and prevent them taking over buildings. The Volunteers shot and clubbed a number of civilians who assaulted them or tried to dismantle their barricades.<ref>Fearghal McGarry, ''The Rising: Ireland Easter 1916'', p. 143</ref>\n\nThat the Rising resulted in a great deal of death and destruction, as well as disrupting food supplies, also contributed to the antagonism toward the rebels. After the surrender, the Volunteers were hissed at, pelted with refuse, and denounced as \"murderers\" and \"starvers of the people\".<ref>McGarry, p. 252</ref> Volunteer Robert Holland for example remembered being \"subjected to very ugly remarks and cat-calls from the poorer classes\" as they marched to surrender. He also reported being abused by people he knew as he was marched through the [[Kilmainham]] area into captivity and said the British troops saved them from being manhandled by the crowd.<ref>Ryan, p. 135</ref><ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.bureauofmilitaryhistory.ie/reels/bmh/BMH.WS0280.pdf|title = Witness statement of Robert Holland|website = Bureau of Military History|accessdate= 14 May 2013}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Waiting on Westland Row (8505718647).jpg|thumb|Crowds in Dublin waiting to welcome republican prisoners released in 1917]]\nHowever, some Dubliners expressed support for the rebels.<ref name=\"mcgarry252-256\">McGarry, pp. 252\u2013256</ref> Canadian journalist and writer Frederick Arthur McKenzie wrote that in poorer areas, \"there was a vast amount of sympathy with the rebels, particularly after the rebels were defeated\".<ref>Ellis, pp. 196\u2013197</ref> He wrote of crowds cheering a column of rebel prisoners as it passed, with one woman remarking \"Shure, we cheer them.

Dublin businessman and [[Quaker]] [[James G. Douglas]], for example, hitherto a Home Ruler, wrote that his political outlook changed radically during the course of the Rising because of the British military occupation of the city and that he became convinced that parliamentary methods would not be enough to remove the British presence.<ref>{{cite book|editor=J.

The [[Conscription Crisis of 1918]] further intensified public support for Sinn F\u00e9in before the [[1918 Irish general election|general elections]] to the [[British Parliament]] on 14 December 1918, which resulted in a landslide victory for Sinn F\u00e9in, winning 73 seats out of 105, whose [[Member of Parliament|MPs]] gathered in Dublin on 21 January 1919 to form [[First D\u00e1il|D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann]] and adopt the [[Declaration of Independence (Ireland)|Declaration of Independence]].<ref>Robert Kee ''The Green Flag: Ourselves Alone''</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\nShortly after the Easter Rising, poet [[Francis Ledwidge]] wrote ''\"O\u2019Connell Street\"'' and ''\"Lament for the Poets of 1916\"'', which both describe his sense of loss and an expression of holding the same \"dreams,\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ricorso.net/rx/az-data/authors/l/Ledwidge_F/life.htm|title=Francis Ledwidge|website=www.ricorso.net|accessdate=19 July 2019}}</ref> as the Easter Rising's [[Irish republicanism|Irish Republicans]]. He would also go on to write ''lament for [[Thomas MacDonagh]]'' for his fallen friend and fellow Irish Volunteer. A few months after the Easter Rising, [[W. B. Yeats]] commemorated some of the fallen figures of the Irish Republican movement, as well as his torn emotions regarding these events, in the poem ''[[Easter, 1916]]''.\n\nSome of the survivors of the Rising went on to become leaders of the independent Irish state. Those who were executed were venerated by many as [[Martyr (politics)|martyrs]]; their graves in Dublin's former military prison of [[Arbour Hill Prison|Arbour Hill]] became a national monument and the [[Proclamation of the Irish Republic|Proclamation]] text was taught in schools. An annual commemorative military parade was held each year on Easter Sunday. In 1935, [[\u00c9amon de Valera]] unveiled a statue of the mythical Irish hero [[C\u00fa Chulainn]], sculpted by [[Oliver Sheppard]], at the [[General Post Office, Dublin|General Post Office]] as part of the Rising commemorations that year \u2013 it is often seen to be an important symbol of martyrdom in remembrance of the 1916 rebels. Memorials to the heroes of the Rising are to be found in other Irish cities, such as [[1916 Memorial, Limerick|Limerick]].\n\nThe parades culminated in a huge national celebration on the 50th anniversary of the Rising in 1966.<ref>{{cite web| place=IE|url=http://www.rte.ie/laweb/ll/ll_t06_other_a.html|website=RT\u00c9|year=1966|title=News Items Relating to the 1916 Easter Rising Commemorations}}</ref> Medals were issued by the government to survivors who took part in the rising at the event.

The [[Government of the 20th D\u00e1il|coalition government]] of 1973\u201377, in particular the [[Minister for Posts and Telegraphs]], [[Conor Cruise O'Brien]], began to promote the view that the violence of 1916 was essentially no different from the violence then taking place in the streets of Belfast and Derry. O'Brien and others asserted that the Rising was doomed to military defeat from the outset, and that it failed to account for the determination of [[Unionism in Ireland|Ulster Unionists]] to remain in the United Kingdom.<ref>{{Cite book|last=O\u2019Brien|first=Conor Cruise|title=States of Ireland |publisher=Hutchinson |year=1972 |isbn=0-09-113100-6 |pages=88, 99{{inconsistent citations}}}}</ref>\n\nIrish republicans continue to venerate the Rising and its leaders with murals in republican areas of Belfast and other towns celebrating the actions of Pearse and his comrades, and annual parades in remembrance of the Rising. The Irish government, however, discontinued its annual parade in Dublin in the early 1970s, and in 1976 it took the unprecedented step of proscribing (under the [[Offences against the State Acts 1939\u20131998|Offences against the State Act]]) a 1916 commemoration ceremony at the GPO organised by Sinn F\u00e9in and the Republican Commemoration Committee.<ref>Irish Times, 22 April 1976</ref> A [[Labour Party (Ireland)|Labour Party]] [[Teachta D\u00e1la|TD]], [[David Thornley]], embarrassed the government (of which Labour was a member) by appearing on the platform at the ceremony, along with [[M\u00e1ire Comerford]], who had fought in the Rising, and [[Fiona Plunkett]], sister of Joseph Plunkett.<ref>Irish Times, 26 April 1976</ref>\n\nWith the advent of a [[Provisional IRA]] ceasefire and the beginning of what became known as the [[Northern Ireland peace process|Peace Process]] during the 1990s, the government's view of the Rising grew more positive and in 1996 an 80th anniversary commemoration at the [[Garden of Remembrance (Dublin)|Garden of Remembrance]] in Dublin was attended by the [[Taoiseach]] and leader of [[Fine Gael]], [[John Bruton]].<ref>[http://www.village.ie/Ireland/Feature/Reconstructing_the_Easter_Rising/ Reconstructing the Easter Rising], Colin Murphy, ''The Village'', 16 February 2006</ref> In 2005, the Taoiseach, [[Bertie Ahern]], announced the government's intention to resume the military parade past the GPO from Easter 2006, and to form a committee to plan centenary celebrations in 2016.<ref>Irish Times, 22 October 2005</ref> The 90th anniversary was celebrated with a military parade in Dublin on Easter Sunday, 2006, attended by the President of Ireland, the Taoiseach and the [[Lord Mayor of Dublin]].<ref>{{cite news|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/in_pictures/4914362.stm|work=[[BBC News]]|title=In pictures: Easter Rising commemorations|date=16 April 2006|accessdate=29 March 2010}}</ref> There is now an annual ceremony at Easter attended by relatives of those who fought, by the President, the Taoiseach, ministers, senators and TDs, and by usually large and respectful crowds.\n\nThe Rising continues to attract debate and analysis.

as the '''Easter Rebellion''', was an armed [[Rebellion|insurrection]] in [[Ireland]] during [[Easter Week]], April 1916. The Rising was launched by [[Irish republicanism|Irish republicans]] to end British rule in Ireland and establish an independent [[Irish Republic]] while the United Kingdom was fighting the [[First World War]]. It was the most significant [[List of Irish uprisings|uprising in Ireland]] since the [[Irish Rebellion of 1798|rebellion of 1798]] and the first armed action of the [[Irish revolutionary period]]. Sixteen of the Rising's leaders were executed in May 1916, but the insurrection, the nature of the executions, and subsequent political developments ultimately contributed to an increase in popular support for Irish independence.\n\nOrganised by a seven-man Military Council of the [[Irish Republican Brotherhood]], the Rising began on Easter Monday, 24 April 1916 and lasted for six days.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=_RhCAAAAIAAJ&dq=%22military+council%22+irb&q=%22military+council%22+&pgis=1#search_anchor ''Leaders and Men of the Easter Rising: Dublin 1916''] Francis X. Martin 1967 p105</ref> Members of the [[Irish Volunteers]], led by schoolmaster and Irish language activist [[Patrick Pearse]], joined by the smaller [[Irish Citizen Army]] of [[James Connolly]] and 200 women of [[Cumann na mBan]], seized strategically important buildings in [[Dublin]] and [[Proclamation of the Irish Republic|proclaimed an Irish Republic]]. The [[British Army]] brought in thousands of reinforcements as well as artillery and a gunboat. There was street fighting on the routes into the city centre, where the rebels slowed the British advance and inflicted many casualties. Elsewhere in Dublin, the fighting mainly consisted of sniping and long-range gun battles. The main rebel positions were gradually surrounded and bombarded with artillery. There were isolated actions in other parts of Ireland; Volunteer leader [[Eoin MacNeill]] had issued a countermand in a bid to halt the Rising, which greatly reduced the number of rebels who mobilised.\n\nWith much greater numbers and heavier weapons, the British Army suppressed the Rising. Pearse agreed to an unconditional surrender on Saturday 29 April, although sporadic fighting continued briefly. After the surrender the country remained under [[martial law]]. About 3,500 people were taken prisoner by the British and 1,800 of them were sent to internment camps or prisons in Britain. Most of the leaders of the Rising were executed following courts-martial. The Rising brought [[Physical force Irish republicanism|physical force republicanism]] back to the forefront of Irish politics, which for nearly fifty years had been dominated by constitutional nationalism. Opposition to the British reaction to the Rising contributed to changes in public opinion and the move toward independence, as shown in the [[1918 Irish general election|December 1918 election]] which was won by the [[Sinn F\u00e9in]] party, which convened the [[First D\u00e1il]] and declared independence.\n\nOf the 485 people killed in the Easter Rising: 54 percent were civilians, 30 percent were British military and police and 16 percent were Irish rebels. More than 2,600 were wounded. Many of the civilians were killed or wounded by British artillery and machine guns or were mistaken for rebels. Others were caught in the crossfire in the crowded city. The shelling and resulting fires left parts of central Dublin in ruins.\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Background==\n[[File:Irish Citizen Army Group Liberty Hall Dublin 1914.jpg|thumb|Members of the Irish Citizen Army outside [[Liberty Hall]], under the slogan \"We serve neither [[George V|King]] nor [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Kaiser]], but Ireland\"]]\nThe [[Acts of Union 1800]] united the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]] and the [[Kingdom of Ireland]] as the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]], abolishing the [[Parliament of Ireland|Irish Parliament]] and giving Ireland representation in the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|British Parliament]].

In 1886, the [[Irish Parliamentary Party]] (IPP) under [[Charles Stewart Parnell]] succeeded in having the [[Irish Government Bill 1886|First Home Rule Bill]] introduced in the British parliament, but it was defeated. The [[Irish Government Bill 1893|Second Home Rule Bill]] of 1893 was passed by the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] but rejected by the [[House of Lords]].\n\nAfter the fall of Parnell, younger and more radical nationalists became disillusioned with parliamentary politics and turned toward more extreme forms of separatism. The [[Gaelic Athletic Association]], the [[Conradh na Gaeilge|Gaelic League]] and the [[Gaelic revival|cultural revival]] under [[W. B. Yeats]] and [[Lady Augusta Gregory]], together with the new political thinking of [[Arthur Griffith]] expressed in his newspaper ''[[Sinn F\u00e9in Printing & Publishing Company|Sinn F\u00e9in]]'' and organisations such as the National Council and the Sinn F\u00e9in League, led many Irish people to identify with the idea of an independent [[Gaels|Gaelic]] Ireland.<ref>MacDonagh, Oliver, pp. 72\u201374</ref><ref>Feeney, p. 22</ref> This was sometimes referred to by the generic term ''Sinn F\u00e9in''.<ref>Feeney, p. 37</ref>\n\nThe [[Government of Ireland Act 1914|Third Home Rule Bill]] was introduced by British Prime Minister [[H.

[[\u00c9amonn Ceannt]] was later added as Director of Communications.<ref>Townshend, p. 92</ref>\n\nIn May 1915, Clarke and MacDermott established a Military Committee or Military Council within the IRB, consisting of Pearse, Plunkett and Ceannt, to draw up plans for a rising.<ref>Foy and Barton, pp. 16, 19</ref> Clarke and MacDermott joined it shortly after. The Military Council was able to promote its own policies and personnel independently of both the Volunteer Executive and the IRB Executive. Although the Volunteer and IRB leaders were not against a rising in principle, they were of the opinion that it was not opportune at that moment.<ref>McGarry, p. 116</ref> Volunteer Chief-of-Staff [[Eoin MacNeill]] supported a rising only if the British government attempted to suppress the Volunteers or introduce conscription, and if such a rising had some chance of success. IRB President [[Denis McCullough]] and prominent IRB member [[Bulmer Hobson]] held similar views.<ref>Townshend, p. 94</ref> The Military Council kept its plans secret, so as to prevent the British authorities learning of the plans, and to thwart those within the organisation who might try to stop the rising. IRB members held officer rank in the Volunteers throughout the country and took their orders from the Military Council, not from MacNeill.<ref>Macardle, p. 119</ref>\n\nShortly after the outbreak of World War I, [[Roger Casement]] and [[Clan na Gael]] leader [[John Devoy]] met the German ambassador to the United States, [[Johann Heinrich von Bernstorff]], to discuss German backing for an uprising. Casement went to Germany and began negotiations with the German government and military. He persuaded the Germans to announce their support for Irish independence in November 1914.<ref>Foy and Barton, p. 25</ref> Casement also attempted to recruit an [[Irish Brigade (World War I)|Irish Brigade]], made up of Irish [[World War I prisoners of war in Germany|prisoners of war]], which would be armed and sent to Ireland to join the uprising.<ref>Townshend, p. 104</ref><ref>Foy and Barton, p. 105</ref> However, only 56 men volunteered. Plunkett joined Casement in Germany the following year. Together, Plunkett and Casement presented a plan (the 'Ireland Report') in which a German [[Expeditionary warfare|expeditionary force]] would land on the west coast of Ireland, while a rising in Dublin diverted the British forces so that the Germans, with the help of local Volunteers, could secure the line of the [[River Shannon]], before advancing on the capital.<ref>McNally and Dennis, p. 30</ref> The German military rejected the plan, but agreed to ship arms and ammunition to the Volunteers.<ref>Foy and Barton, pp. 25\u201328</ref>\n\n[[James Connolly]]\u2014head of the [[Irish Citizen Army]] (ICA), a group of armed socialist trade union men and women\u2014was unaware of the IRB's plans, and threatened to start a rebellion on his own if other parties failed to act. If they had done it alone, the IRB and the Volunteers would possibly have come to their aid;<ref>[[Eoin Neeson]], ''Myths from Easter 1916'', p. ?</ref> however, the IRB leaders met with Connolly in January 1916 and convinced him to join forces with them. They agreed that they would launch a rising together at Easter and made Connolly the sixth member of the Military Council. [[Thomas MacDonagh]] would later become the seventh and final member.\n\nThe death of the old [[Fenian]] leader [[Jeremiah O'Donovan Rossa]] in [[New York City|New York]] in August 1915 was an opportunity to mount a spectacular demonstration. His body was sent to Ireland for burial in [[Glasnevin Cemetery]], with the Volunteers in charge of arrangements. Huge crowds lined the route and gathered at the graveside. Pearse made a dramatic funeral oration, a rallying call to republicans, which ended with the words \"[[Ireland unfree shall never be at peace]]\".<ref>Kennedy, pp. 199\u2013200</ref>\n\n==Build-up to Easter Week==\n[[File:Signatories of the Proclamation of the Republic.png|thumb|The signatories of the Proclamation: Tom Clarke, Se\u00e1n MacDiarmada, Thomas MacDonagh, Patrick Pearse, \u00c9amonn Ceannt, James Connolly, Joseph Plunkett]]\nIn early April, Pearse issued orders to the Irish Volunteers for three days of \"parades and manoeuvres\" beginning on Easter Sunday. He had the authority to do this, as the Volunteers' Director of Organisation. The idea was that IRB members within the organisation would know these were orders to begin the rising, while men such as MacNeill and the British authorities would take it at face value.\n\nOn 9 April, the [[Imperial German Navy|German Navy]] dispatched the [[SS Libau]] for [[County Kerry]], disguised as the Norwegian ship ''Aud''.<ref>Caulfield, Max, p. 29</ref> It was loaded with 20,000 rifles, one million rounds of ammunition, and explosives. Casement also left for Ireland aboard the German submarine ''[[SM U-19 (Germany)|U-19]]''. He was disappointed with the level of support offered by the Germans and he intended to stop or at least postpone the rising.<ref>Foy and Barton, p.56</ref>\n\nOn Wednesday 19 April, Alderman [[Thomas Kelly (Sinn F\u00e9in politician)|Tom Kelly]], a Sinn F\u00e9in member of Dublin Corporation, read out at a meeting of the Corporation a document purportedly leaked from Dublin Castle, detailing plans by the British authorities to shortly arrest leaders of the Irish Volunteers, Sinn F\u00e9in and the Gaelic League, and occupy their premises.<ref>Townshend, pp. 131\u2013132</ref> Although the British authorities said the \"Castle Document\" was fake, MacNeill ordered the Volunteers to prepare to resist.<ref>Foy and Barton, p. 47</ref> Unbeknownst to MacNeill, the document had been [[Forgery|forged]] by the Military Council to persuade moderates of the need for their planned uprising. It was an edited version of a real document outlining British plans in the event of conscription.<ref>McGarry, p. 117</ref> That same day, the Military Council informed senior Volunteer officers that the rising would begin on Easter Sunday. However, it chose not to inform the rank-and-file, or moderates such as MacNeill, until the last minute.<ref>Foy and Barton, p. 48</ref>\n\nThe following day, MacNeill got wind that a rising was about to be launched and threatened to do everything he could to prevent it, short of informing the British.<ref>Foy and Barton, p. 52</ref> MacNeill was briefly persuaded to go along with some sort of action when Mac Diarmada revealed to him that a German arms shipment was about to land in [[County Kerry]]. MacNeill believed that when the British learned of the shipment they would immediately suppress the Volunteers, thus the Volunteers would be justified in taking defensive action, including the planned manoeuvres.<ref>Michael Tierney, ''Eoin MacNeill'', pp. 199, 214</ref>\n\nThe ''Aud'' and the ''U-19'' reached the coast of Kerry on Good Friday, 21 April. This was earlier than the Volunteers expected and so none were there to meet the vessels. The [[Royal Navy]] had known about the arms shipment and intercepted the ''Aud'', prompting the captain to [[Scuttling|scuttle]] the ship. Furthermore, Casement was captured shortly after he landed at [[Banna Strand]].<ref>Foy and Barton, pp. 57\u201358</ref>\n\nWhen MacNeill learned from Vol. [[Patrick Whelan]] that the arms shipment had been lost, he reverted to his original position. With the support of other leaders of like mind, notably Bulmer Hobson and [[The O'Rahilly]], he issued a countermand to all Volunteers, cancelling all actions for Sunday. This countermanding order was relayed to Volunteer officers and printed in the Sunday morning newspapers. It succeeded only in delaying the rising for a day, although it greatly reduced the number of Volunteers who turned out.\n\n[[Naval Intelligence Division|British Naval Intelligence]] had been aware of the arms shipment, Casement's return, and the Easter date for the rising through radio messages between Germany and its embassy in the United States that were intercepted by the Royal Navy and deciphered in [[Room 40]] of the Admiralty.<ref>\u00d3 Broin, p. 138</ref> The information was passed to the [[Under-Secretary for Ireland]], Sir [[Matthew Nathan]], on 17 April, but without revealing its source, and Nathan was doubtful about its accuracy.<ref>\u00d3 Broin, p. 79</ref> When news reached Dublin of the capture of the ''Aud'' and the arrest of Casement, Nathan conferred with the [[Lord Lieutenant of Ireland|Lord Lieutenant]], [[Ivor Guest, 1st Viscount Wimborne|Lord Wimborne]]. Nathan proposed to raid [[Liberty Hall]], headquarters of the Citizen Army, and Volunteer properties at Father Matthew Park and at [[Kimmage]], but Wimborne insisted on wholesale arrests of the leaders. It was decided to postpone action until after Easter Monday, and in the meantime Nathan telegraphed the [[Chief Secretary for Ireland|Chief Secretary]], [[Augustine Birrell]], in London seeking his approval.<ref>\u00d3 Broin, pp. 81\u201387</ref> By the time Birrell cabled his reply authorising the action, at noon on Monday 24 April 1916, the Rising had already begun.<ref>\u00d3 Broin, p. 88</ref>\n\nOn the morning of Easter Sunday, 23 April, the Military Council met at Liberty Hall to discuss what to do in light of MacNeill's countermanding order. They decided that the Rising would go ahead the following day, Easter Monday, and that the Irish Volunteers and Irish Citizen Army would go into action as the 'Army of the Irish Republic'. They elected Pearse as president of the Irish Republic, and also as Commander-in-Chief of the army; Connolly became Commandant of the Dublin Brigade.<ref>Foy and Barton, p. 66</ref> Messengers were then sent to all units informing them of the new orders.<ref name=\"rte-timeline\">[http://www.rte.ie/centuryireland/index.php/articles/chronology-of-the-easter-rising Chronology of the Easter Rising].

This was due to MacNeill's countermanding order, and the fact that the new orders had been sent so soon beforehand. However, several hundred Volunteers joined the Rising after it began.<ref name=\"McGarry, p. 129\">McGarry, p. 129</ref>\n\nShortly before midday, the rebels began to seize important sites in central Dublin. The rebels' plan was to hold Dublin city centre. This was a large, oval-shaped area bounded by two canals: the [[Grand Canal (Ireland)|Grand]] to the south and the [[Royal Canal|Royal]] to the north, with the [[River Liffey]] running through the middle. On the southern and western edges of this district were five British Army barracks. Most of the rebels' positions had been chosen to defend against counter-attacks from these barracks.<ref>Dorney, John. ''The Story of the Easter Rising, 1916''. Green Lamp, 2010. p. 33</ref> The rebels took the positions with ease. Civilians were evacuated and policemen were ejected or taken prisoner.<ref>McGarry, p. 133</ref> Windows and doors were barricaded, food and supplies were secured, and first aid posts were set up. Barricades were erected on the streets to hinder British Army movement.<ref>McGarry, p. 135</ref>\n\nA joint force of about 400 Volunteers and Citizen Army gathered at Liberty Hall under the command of Commandant James Connolly. This was the headquarters battalion, and it also included Commander-in-Chief Patrick Pearse, as well as [[Tom Clarke (Irish republican)|Tom Clarke]], [[Se\u00e1n Mac Diarmada|Se\u00e1n MacDermott]] and [[Joseph Mary Plunkett|Joseph Plunkett]].<ref>McNally and Dennis, p. 41</ref> They marched to the [[General Post Office, Dublin|General Post Office]] (GPO) on [[O'Connell Street]], Dublin's main thoroughfare, occupied the building and hoisted two republican flags. Pearse stood outside and read the [[Proclamation of the Irish Republic]].<ref>Foy and Barton, pp. 192, 195</ref> Copies of the Proclamation were also pasted on walls and handed out to bystanders by Volunteers and newsboys.<ref>McGarry, p. 134</ref> The GPO would be the rebels' headquarters for most of the Rising. Volunteers from the GPO also occupied other buildings on the street, including buildings overlooking [[O'Connell Bridge]]. They took over a [[Wireless telegraphy|wireless telegraph]] station and sent out a [[Radio broadcasting|radio broadcast]] in [[Morse code]], announcing that an Irish Republic had been declared. This was the first radio broadcast in Ireland.<ref>McGee, John.

The 1st battalion, under [[Edward Daly (Irish revolutionary)|Edward 'Ned' Daly]], occupied the [[Four Courts]] and surrounding buildings, while a company under [[Se\u00e1n Heuston]] occupied the [[Mendicity Institution]], across the River Liffey from the Four Courts. The 2nd battalion, under [[Thomas MacDonagh]], occupied [[Jacob's]] biscuit factory. The 3rd battalion, under [[\u00c9amon de Valera]], occupied [[Boland's Mill]] and surrounding buildings. The 4th battalion, under [[\u00c9amonn Ceannt]], occupied the [[House of Industry (Dublin)|South Dublin Union]] and the distillery on [[Marrowbone Lane]]. From each of these garrisons, small units of rebels established [[Outpost (military)|outposts]] in the surrounding area.<ref>McNally and Dennis, pp. 39\u201340</ref>\n\nThe rebels also attempted to cut transport and communication links. As well as erecting roadblocks, they took control of various bridges and cut telephone and telegraph wires. [[Dublin Pearse railway station|Westland Row]] and [[Harcourt Street railway station|Harcourt Street]] railway stations were occupied, though the latter only briefly. The railway line was cut at [[Fairview, Dublin|Fairview]] and the line was damaged by bombs at [[Dublin Connolly railway station|Amiens Street]], [[Dublin Broadstone railway station|Broadstone]], [[Dublin Heuston railway station|Kingsbridge]] and [[Lansdowne Road railway station|Lansdowne Road]].<ref>McKenna, Joseph.

The goal was to seize weapons and blow up the ammunition store to signal that the Rising had begun. They seized weapons and planted explosives, but the blast was not big enough to be heard across the city.<ref>Caulfield, Max, pp. 48\u201350</ref> The 23-year-old son of the fort's commander was fatally shot when he ran to raise the alarm.<ref>[http://www.historyireland.com/20th-century-contemporary-history/children-of-the-revolution/ \"Children of the Revolution\"].

As they approached the gate a lone and unarmed police sentry, James O'Brien, attempted to stop them and was shot dead by Connolly. According to some accounts, he was the first casualty of the Rising. The rebels overpowered the soldiers in the guardroom, but failed to press further. The British Army's chief intelligence officer, Major Ivon Price, fired on the rebels while the [[Under-Secretary for Ireland]], Sir [[Matthew Nathan]], helped shut the castle gates. Unbeknownst to the rebels, the Castle was lightly guarded and could have been taken with ease.<ref>Foy and Barton, pp. 84\u201385</ref> The rebels instead laid siege to the Castle from City Hall.

Two troops of British cavalry were sent to investigate what was happening.

The British troops, after taking some casualties, managed to regroup and launch several assaults on the position before they forced their way inside and the small rebel force in the tin huts at the eastern end of the Union surrendered.<ref>Caulfield, Max, pp. 76\u201380</ref> However, the Union complex as a whole remained in rebel hands. A nurse in uniform, Margaret Keogh, was shot dead by British soldiers at the Union.

The British commander, Lowe, worked slowly, unsure of the size of the force he was up against, and with only 1,269 troops in the city when he arrived from the [[Curragh Camp]] in the early hours of Tuesday 25 April.

In the northeast, British troops left Amiens Street railway station in an armoured train, to secure and repair a section of damaged tracks. They were attacked by rebels who had taken up position at [[Annesley Bridge]]. After a two-hour battle, the British were forced to retreat and several soldiers were captured.<ref name=caulfield145>Caulfield, pp. 145\u2013146</ref> At [[Phibsborough]], in the northwest, rebels had occupied buildings and erected barricades at junctions on the North Circular Road.

As a result, during the following week, the British were able to bring in thousands of reinforcements from Britain and from their garrisons at [[the Curragh]] and [[Belfast]]. By the end of the week, British strength stood at over 16,000 men.<ref name=\"Townshend p191\"/><ref>McGarry, pp. 167\u2013169</ref> Their firepower was provided by field artillery which they positioned on the [[Northside, Dublin|Northside]] of the city at Phibsborough and at [[Trinity College, Dublin|Trinity College]], and by the patrol vessel ''[[Irish patrol vessel Muirch\u00fa|Helga]]'', which sailed up the [[River Liffey|Liffey]], having been summoned from the port at Kingstown.

British troops advanced on the building, supported by snipers and machine gun fire, but the Volunteers put up stiff resistance. Eventually, the troops got close enough to hurl grenades into the building, some of which the rebels threw back.

From Thursday to Saturday, the British made repeated attempts to take the area, in what was some of the fiercest fighting of the Rising. As the troops moved in, the rebels continually opened fire from windows and behind chimneys and barricades. At one point, a platoon led by Major Sheppard made a [[Charge (warfare)|bayonet charge]] on one of the barricades, but was cut down by rebel fire.

Although they did not receive as much attention as the executions, they sparked outrage among the Irish public and were raised by Irish MPs in Parliament.\n\nOne incident was the 'Portobello killings'. On Tuesday 25 April, Dubliner [[Francis Sheehy-Skeffington]], a pacifist nationalist activist, had been arrested by British soldiers. Captain John Bowen-Colthurst then took him with a British raiding party as a hostage and [[human shield]]. On Rathmines Road he stopped a boy named James Coade, whom he shot dead. His troops then destroyed a tobacconist's shop with grenades and seized journalists Thomas Dickson and Patrick MacIntyre. The next morning, Colthurst had Skeffington and the two journalists shot by firing squad in [[Cathal Brugha Barracks|Portobello Barracks]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Bacon|first1=Bryan|title=A Terrible Duty: the Madness of Captain Bowen-Colthurst|date=2015|publisher=Thena Press}}</ref> The bodies were then buried there. Later that day he shot a Labour Party councillor, [[Richard O'Carroll]]. When Major Sir [[Francis Vane]] learned of the killings he telephoned his superiors in Dublin Castle, but no action was taken. Vane informed [[Herbert Kitchener]], who told General [[John Maxwell (British Army officer)|Maxwell]] to arrest Colthurst, but Maxwell refused. Colthurst was eventually arrested and court-martialled in June. He was found guilty of murder but insane, and detained for twenty months at [[Broadmoor Hospital|Broadmoor]]. Public and political pressure led to a public inquiry, which reached similar conclusions. Major Vane was discharged \"owing to his action in the Skeffington murder case\".<ref>McGarry, p. 186</ref><ref>Townshend, p. 193</ref><ref>Caulfield, Max, p. 187</ref><ref>Yeates, P\u00e1draig.

On the night of 28\u201329 April, British soldiers of the [[South Staffordshire Regiment]], under Colonel Henry Taylor, had burst into houses on North King Street and killed 15 male civilians whom they accused of being rebels. The soldiers shot or bayoneted the victims, then secretly buried some of them in cellars or back yards after robbing them. The area saw some of the fiercest fighting of the Rising and the British had taken heavy casualties for little gain. General Maxwell attempted to excuse the killings and argued that the rebels were ultimately responsible. He claimed that \"the rebels wore no uniform\" and that the people of North King Street were rebel sympathisers. Maxwell concluded that such incidents \"are absolutely unavoidable in such a business as this\" and that \"under the circumstance the troops [...] behaved with the greatest restraint\". A private brief, prepared for the Prime Minister, said the soldiers \"had orders not to take any prisoners\" but took it to mean they were to shoot any suspected rebel. The City Coroner's inquest found that soldiers had killed \"unarmed and unoffending\" residents. The military court of inquiry ruled that no specific soldiers could be held responsible, and no action was taken.<ref>McGarry, p. 187</ref><ref>Caulfield, pp. 338\u2013340</ref><ref>Coogan {{which|date=September 2016}}, pp. 152\u2013155</ref><ref>Townshend, pp. 293\u2013294</ref><ref>Dorney, John.

Historian [[Keith Jeffery]] noted that most of the opposition came from people whose relatives were in the British Army and who depended on their army allowances.<ref>Kennedy, p. 286</ref> Those most openly hostile to the Volunteers were the \"separation women\" (so-called because they were paid \"separation money\" by the British government), whose husbands and sons were fighting in the British Army in the First World War. There was also hostility from [[Unionism in Ireland|unionists]].<ref>Foy and Barton, pp. 203\u2013209</ref> Supporters of the [[Irish Parliamentary Party]] also felt the rebellion was a betrayal of their party.<ref>\"The loyalists spoke with an air of contempt, 'the troops will settle the matter in an hour or two, these pro-Germans will run away...' The Redmondites were more bitter, 'I hope they'll all be hanged' ... 'Shooting's too good for them.

After the surrender, the Volunteers were hissed at, pelted with refuse, and denounced as \"murderers\" and \"starvers of the people\".<ref>McGarry, p. 252</ref> Volunteer Robert Holland for example remembered being \"subjected to very ugly remarks and cat-calls from the poorer classes\" as they marched to surrender. He also reported being abused by people he knew as he was marched through the [[Kilmainham]] area into captivity and said the British troops saved them from being manhandled by the crowd.<ref>Ryan, p. 135</ref><ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.bureauofmilitaryhistory.ie/reels/bmh/BMH.WS0280.pdf|title = Witness statement of Robert Holland|website = Bureau of Military History|accessdate= 14 May 2013}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Waiting on Westland Row (8505718647).jpg|thumb|Crowds in Dublin waiting to welcome republican prisoners released in 1917]]\nHowever, some Dubliners expressed support for the rebels.<ref name=\"mcgarry252-256\">McGarry, pp. 252\u2013256</ref> Canadian journalist and writer Frederick Arthur McKenzie wrote that in poorer areas, \"there was a vast amount of sympathy with the rebels, particularly after the rebels were defeated\".<ref>Ellis, pp. 196\u2013197</ref> He wrote of crowds cheering a column of rebel prisoners as it passed, with one woman remarking \"Shure, we cheer them.

Dublin businessman and [[Quaker]] [[James G. Douglas]], for example, hitherto a Home Ruler, wrote that his political outlook changed radically during the course of the Rising because of the British military occupation of the city and that he became convinced that parliamentary methods would not be enough to remove the British presence.<ref>{{cite book|editor=J.

He would also go on to write ''lament for [[Thomas MacDonagh]]'' for his fallen friend and fellow Irish Volunteer. A few months after the Easter Rising, [[W. B. Yeats]] commemorated some of the fallen figures of the Irish Republican movement, as well as his torn emotions regarding these events, in the poem ''[[Easter, 1916]]''.\n\nSome of the survivors of the Rising went on to become leaders of the independent Irish state. Those who were executed were venerated by many as [[Martyr (politics)|martyrs]]; their graves in Dublin's former military prison of [[Arbour Hill Prison|Arbour Hill]] became a national monument and the [[Proclamation of the Irish Republic|Proclamation]] text was taught in schools. An annual commemorative military parade was held each year on Easter Sunday. In 1935, [[\u00c9amon de Valera]] unveiled a statue of the mythical Irish hero [[C\u00fa Chulainn]], sculpted by [[Oliver Sheppard]], at the [[General Post Office, Dublin|General Post Office]] as part of the Rising commemorations that year \u2013 it is often seen to be an important symbol of martyrdom in remembrance of the 1916 rebels. Memorials to the heroes of the Rising are to be found in other Irish cities, such as [[1916 Memorial, Limerick|Limerick]].\n\nThe parades culminated in a huge national celebration on the 50th anniversary of the Rising in 1966.<ref>{{cite web| place=IE|url=http://www.rte.ie/laweb/ll/ll_t06_other_a.html|website=RT\u00c9|year=1966|title=News Items Relating to the 1916 Easter Rising Commemorations}}</ref> Medals were issued by the government to survivors who took part in the rising at the event.

The [[Government of the 20th D\u00e1il|coalition government]] of 1973\u201377, in particular the [[Minister for Posts and Telegraphs]], [[Conor Cruise O'Brien]], began to promote the view that the violence of 1916 was essentially no different from the violence then taking place in the streets of Belfast and Derry.

The Irish government, however, discontinued its annual parade in Dublin in the early 1970s, and in 1976 it took the unprecedented step of proscribing (under the [[Offences against the State Acts 1939\u20131998|Offences against the State Act]]) a 1916 commemoration ceremony at the GPO organised by Sinn F\u00e9in and the Republican Commemoration Committee.<ref>Irish Times, 22 April 1976</ref> A [[Labour Party (Ireland)|Labour Party]] [[Teachta D\u00e1la|TD]], [[David Thornley]], embarrassed the government (of which Labour was a member) by appearing on the platform at the ceremony, along with [[M\u00e1ire Comerford]], who had fought in the Rising, and [[Fiona Plunkett]], sister of Joseph Plunkett.<ref>Irish Times, 26 April 1976</ref>\n\nWith the advent of a [[Provisional IRA]] ceasefire and the beginning of what became known as the [[Northern Ireland peace process|Peace Process]] during the 1990s, the government's view of the Rising grew more positive and in 1996 an 80th anniversary commemoration at the [[Garden of Remembrance (Dublin)|Garden of Remembrance]] in Dublin was attended by the [[Taoiseach]] and leader of [[Fine Gael]], [[John Bruton]].<ref>[http://www.village.ie/Ireland/Feature/Reconstructing_the_Easter_Rising/ Reconstructing the Easter Rising], Colin Murphy, ''The Village'', 16 February 2006</ref> In 2005, the Taoiseach, [[Bertie Ahern]], announced the government's intention to resume the military parade past the GPO from Easter 2006, and to form a committee to plan centenary celebrations in 2016.<ref>Irish Times, 22 October 2005</ref> The 90th anniversary was celebrated with a military parade in Dublin on Easter Sunday, 2006, attended by the President of Ireland, the Taoiseach and the [[Lord Mayor of Dublin]].<ref>{{cite news|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/in_pictures/4914362.stm|work=[[BBC News]]|title=In pictures: Easter Rising commemorations|date=16 April 2006|accessdate=29 March 2010}}</ref> There is now an annual ceremony at Easter attended by relatives of those who fought, by the President, the Taoiseach, ministers, senators and TDs, and by usually large and respectful crowds.\n\nThe Rising continues to attract debate and analysis.

These developments led to fears by [[French Canadian|French-Canadian]] nationalists that French speakers would be assimilated into the increasingly Anglophone culture of Ontario, leading the [[Royal Commission on Bilingualism and Biculturalism]] (1963\u20131969) to recommend that the [[Government of Canada]] and [[Provinces and territories of Canada|all provinces]] offer more services in French.\n\nSince that time, Quebec has used provincial law to encourage the use of French (see [[Charter of the French Language]]) ahead of other languages, while the other provinces have begun to offer more and more services in French and in [[Languages of Canada|other languages besides English]], including [[Languages of Canada#aboriginal languages|aboriginal languages]] and [[immigrant language]]s.<ref name=\"Morton2002\">{{cite book|author=Frederick Lee Morton|title=Law, Politics and the Judicial Process in Canada|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dj_4_H35nmYC&pg=PA509|year=2002|publisher=University of Calgary Press|isbn=978-1-55238-046-8|page=509}}</ref> The [[Amendments to the Constitution of Canada|1982 amendments]] to the [[Constitution of Canada]] included a right of minority-language education that has resulted in policy changes in all of the provinces.

In other provinces there is no requirement that businesses use a particular language, but English predominates, and immigrants may send their children to English, French or third-language schools.<ref name=\"Carens1995\">{{cite book|author=Joseph H.

No specific policies were enacted for the other provinces, and no provisions were made for the official languages to be used in other elements of the government such the courts, schools, post offices, and so on. The official language policies of the provinces and territories were initially set when they were created by the federal government, or in the case of provinces that were separate colonies before joining Confederation ([[Dominion of Newfoundland|Newfoundland]], [[History of Prince Edward Island|Prince Edward Island]], and [[History of British Columbia|British Columbia]]) were inherited from their own histories. Language policies in all provinces have evolved over time in response to changing demographics, public attitudes, and legal rulings.\n\n=== The Prairies ===\nPrior to becoming part of Canada in 1869, English was a minority language in the [[Canadian Prairies|Prairies]], where French and Aboriginal languages were more common. The arrival of settlers from [[History of Ontario|Ontario]], the [[British Isles]], and the [[United States]] changed the demographic balance, however. One of the outcomes of the [[Red River Rebellion]] of 1870 was the creation of [[History of Manitoba|Manitoba]] as an officially bilingual province, to protect the French-speaking [[M\u00e9tis people (Canada)|M\u00e9tis]] from being overpowered by the incoming English speaking settlers. This guarantee failed, however, and in the aftermath of the [[Manitoba Schools Question]], that province was allowed to become officially English-only, until these policies were declared unconstitutional in 1985.\n\nThe [[Northwest Territories Act]] of 1891 made English and French official languages in the rest of the [[Western Canada|Canadian West]]. But in 1892 the [[Legislative Assembly of the Northwest Territories|Legislature of the Northwest Territories]] declared itself English-only.\n\nThis trend continued to the creation of the new provinces of [[History of Alberta|Alberta]] and [[History of Saskatchewan|Saskatchewan]] in 1905, and beyond. {{quote|By the time Alberta was made a province in 1905, the French language had been dealt a series of aggressive blows, and the use of French in government, the courts and schools was made illegal.|Alberta Online Encyclopedia<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abheritage.ca/stvincent-stpaul/franco_alta/themes_language_en.html |title=Alberta Online Encyclopedia - Saint Vincent and St. Paul - Language |publisher=Abheritage.ca |date=2010-12-08 |accessdate=2011-11-02}}</ref>}}\n\n== Effect of the ''Charter'' on the provinces and territories ==\n[[Section Twenty-three of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]] guarantees that Canadian-born or educated parents (not recent immigrants) have a right to educate their children in their choice of either French or English wherever there are \"sufficient numbers\". This was a major change in that education is normally considered solely provincial jurisdiction, and policy had been [[Majority rule|majoritarian]]. Court cases such as ''[[Doucet-Boudreau v Nova Scotia (Minister of Education)]]'' have indicated that this is a [[Negative and positive rights|positive right]] that demands timely and sufficient action from the provincial governments.\n\n==Officially bilingual or multilingual provinces/territories==\nNew Brunswick and Canada's three territories have all given official status to more than one language. In the case of New Brunswick, this means perfect equality. In the other cases, the recognition sometimes amounts to a formal recognition of official languages, but limited services in official languages other than English. Manitoba was officially bilingual at its creation, became officially Anglophone only, but this was later reversed by the courts.\n\n=== The territories ===\n{{see also|Franco-T\u00e9nois|Franco-Yukonnais}}\n*[[Northwest Territories]]: [[Chipewyan language|Chipewyan]], [[Cree language|Cree]], English, French, [[Gwich\u2019in language|Gwich\u2019in]], [[Inuinnaqtun]], [[Inuktitut]], [[Inuvialuktun]], [[Slavey language|North Slavey]], South Slavey and [[T\u0142\u0131\u0328ch\u01eb language|T\u0142\u012fch\u01eb or Dogrib]].\n*[[Nunavut]]: English, Inuktitut, Inuinnaqtun, and French.\n*[[Yukon]]: English and French.\n\n=== New Brunswick ===\nNew Brunswick has been officially bilingual in English and French since the passing of the ''[[Official Languages in New Brunswick Act (1969)]]''. This was complemented by ''[[An Act Recognizing the Equality of the Two Official Linguistic Communities in New Brunswick]]'' in 1981. New Brunswick's bilingualism was constitutionally enshrined in the ''Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms'' in 1982. The ''Charter'' was amended in 1993 to clarify that the two language communities are legally equal. In 1999 the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] ruled in ''[[Moncton (City) v. Charlebois]]'' that New Brunswick's official bilingualism also applied to municipalities in the province. In 2002 the ''[[Official Languages Act (New Brunswick)|Official Languages Act]]'' became New Brunswick's new language law, leading to the creation of the [[Office of the Commissioner of Official Languages for New Brunswick]] in 2003.<ref>[http://www.legal-info-legale.nb.ca/en/.../History_of_Language_Rights_ENG.pdf ]{{dead link|date=November 2011}}</ref>\n\n=== Manitoba ===\n{{see also|Franco-Manitoban}}\n{{quote|Manitoba stands out amongst the provinces as a province with a small Francophone linguistic minority but above-average constitutional protection of this minority.|Fraser Institute<ref>Vallincourt et al., viii</ref>}}\nManitoba was established as an officially bilingual province under section 23 of the [[Manitoba Act]], 1870. However, in subsequent years the provincial government moved to end French-language services and become English-only. In the famous Supreme Court of Canada case ''[[Reference Re Manitoba Language Rights]]'' of 1985 the court found these policies unconstitutional. The province of Manitoba is now overwhelmingly English-speaking and the first language of the courts, government ministries, and schools is English. However, in order to comply with the court's ruling the province is required to provide nearly all its services in French (as well as English). The government's policy is summarized in the ''French Language Services Policy'', last updated in March 1999.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.mb.ca/fls-slf/pdf/fls_policy.pdf|format=PDF|title=French-Language Services Policy |date=May 2017|website=Gov.mb.ca|accessdate=25 January 2018}}</ref>\n\n== Regionalized bilingualism: Ontario ==\n{{see also|Franco-Ontarian}}\nOntario has a regionalized language policy, where part of the province is English-only and other areas are bilingual. Province-wide services (such as websites and toll-free telephone numbers) are provided in both English and French. However individuals only have a ''right'' to French-language services in certain designated regions of the province under the ''[[French Language Services Act]]'' (1986). There are 25 regions so designated. These are: areas with 10% or more Francophones; urban centres with 5,000 or more Francophones; and areas previously designated by the [[Government of Ontario]] between 1978 and 1985.<ref name=\"ontario.ca\">{{cite web|url=https://www.ontario.ca/en/communities/francophones/profile/ONT05_024287.html |title=Profile of Ontario's Francophone Community, 2009: Concepts and Definitions |publisher=Ontario.ca |date= |accessdate=2011-11-02}}</ref> Notably this includes [[Toronto]], the provincial capital and Canada's largest municipality (although not all of the [[regional municipalities]] of the [[Greater Toronto Area|GTA]] are included), and the [[National Capital Region (Canada)|National Capital Region]] including [[Ottawa]], as well as many other cities, counties, districts, townships, and towns.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ofa.gov.on.ca/en/flsa-mapdesig.html |title=Government of Ontario - Office of Francophone Affairs: Map of Designated Areas |publisher=Ofa.gov.on.ca |date= |accessdate=2011-11-02}}</ref> For the purposes of the policy, the definition of a \"Francophone\" was broadened in 2009.

English was also used in the legislature, government commissions and courts.\n\n''[[An Act to promote the French language in Qu\u00e9bec]]'' was passed in 1969 by the [[Union Nationale (Quebec)|Union Nationale]] government of [[Jean-Jacques Bertrand]]. It required the [[Ministry of Education, Recreation and Sports (Quebec)|education ministry]] to ensure that French as a [[second language]] was taught to all English-speakers and immigrants in Quebec, but allowed [[Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois (word)|Quebecers]] freedom of choice in deciding in which language to educate their children. This was considered too weak by many [[Quebec nationalism|Quebec nationalists]], leading to the creation of the [[Mouvement Qu\u00e9bec fran\u00e7ais]] and increased support for the new [[Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois]].\n\nFrom 1968 to 1973, the [[Commission of Inquiry on the Situation of the French Language and Linguistic Rights in Quebec]] investigated how to strengthen the position of French in Quebec. Its recommendations led to the passage of the [[Official Language Act (Quebec)|''Official Language Act'']] or \"Bill 22\" in 1974 by the [[Quebec Liberal Party]] government of [[Robert Bourassa]]. This made French the sole official language of Quebec and required its use in business.\n\nBill 22 was replaced by the ''Charter of the French Language'' (Bill 101) by Quebec's [[National Assembly of Quebec|National Assembly]] in August 1977, under the Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois government led by [[Ren\u00e9 L\u00e9vesque]]. It is structured as a list of rights, where everyone in Quebec has the right to be served in French by the government and businesses, and also provides rights for speakers of English and aboriginal languages. Most government services are available in both French and English. Regional institutions in the [[Nunavik]] region of [[Nord-du-Qu\u00e9bec|northern Quebec]] offer services in [[Inuktitut]] and [[Cree language|Cree]].\n\nSeveral legal challenges have been raised against Bill 101 in the ongoing [[legal dispute over Quebec's language policy]]. In 1988, the Supreme Court of Canada ruled in ''[[Ford v Quebec (AG)]]'' that the ban on outdoor signs in languages other than French was unconstitutional. The government of Quebec choose to invoke the \"[[Section Thirty-three of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|notwithstanding clause]]\" to shield the legislation from the courts. The [[United Nations Commission on Human Rights]] ruled similarly in ''[[Ballantyne v Canada]]'' in 1993. The ban on non-French signs was lifted with the passage of [[Bill 86]] in 1993.\n\n==Officially English with services in French and other languages==\nMost provinces have laws that make either English or both English and French the official language(s) of the legislature and the courts, but may also have separate policies in regards to education and the bureaucracy.\n\n=== Alberta ===\n{{see also|Franco-Albertan}}\nAlberta inherited its English-only status from the Northwest Territories in 1905, and this was strengthened over time.

There are 59 regional English language school boards in the province and [[Conseil scolaire francophone de la Colombie-Britannique|one province-wide francophone board]]. There is one French language college ([[Educacentre College]]), no French-language universities but some French-medium instruction at [[Simon Fraser University]].\n\nOutside of education, there is no legal framework for minority language services by the civil service or the courts.<ref>Vallincourt et al., 9</ref>\n\n=== Newfoundland and Labrador ===\n{{see also|Franco-Newfoundlander}}\nMany Aboriginal and European languages were once widely spoken in Newfoundland and Labrador. However, Britain eventually gained firm and unchallenged control of the island and adjacent coast following the French defeat in the [[Seven Years' War]], and English then became the language of administration and commerce, as in most of the [[British Empire]]. In isolated fishing villages many minority languages persisted in private use, however, until the coming of standardized education in the 19th, and more so the 20th centuries. When Newfoundland joined Confederation in 1949 it had already used English as the sole language of government for several centuries. Today, Newfoundland is the most linguistically homogeneous province in Canada. In 1999, 98% of the population spoke only English as their sole mother tongue.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.heritage.nf.ca/society/language.html |title=Language: Newfoundland and Labrador Heritage |publisher=Heritage.nf.ca |date= |accessdate=2011-11-02}}</ref> The [[Government of Newfoundland and Labrador]] has no statutory language policy, simply having inherited English from colonial times.

Newfoundland was also home to unique regional dialects of the [[Newfoundland French|French]] and [[Irish language in Newfoundland|Irish Gaelic]] languages, now extinct, as well as smaller groups of [[Old Norse]], [[Basque language|Basque]], Spanish, Portuguese, German, and [[Scottish Gaelic|Scots Gaelic]] speakers.

In three provinces (Manitoba, New Brunswick, and Quebec) there are other constitutional rights that come into play, over and above Section 23. In Ontario, there is a developed policy of statutory (not constitutional) minority language rights.<ref>Vaillancourt, et al., vi</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|Canada|Languages}}\n*[[Official bilingualism in Canada]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Provinces and territories of Canada}}\n\n[[Category:Languages of Canada]]\n[[Category:Language policy]]\n[[Category:Provinces and territories of Canada]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use Canadian English|date = April 2019}}\n\n{{Short description|language policies in Canada}}\n\n{{Use mdy dates|date = April 2019}}\n\nThe '''language policies of Canada's province and territories''' vary substantially between different regions and also between different eras.\n\nFrom the 1890s until the 1960s, English was the only language in which most government services were provided outside of [[History of Quebec|Quebec]] (which was functionally bilingual) and using French in the courts or in schools was often illegal. These developments led to fears by [[French Canadian|French-Canadian]] nationalists that French speakers would be assimilated into the increasingly Anglophone culture of Ontario, leading the [[Royal Commission on Bilingualism and Biculturalism]] (1963\u20131969) to recommend that the [[Government of Canada]] and [[Provinces and territories of Canada|all provinces]] offer more services in French.\n\nSince that time, Quebec has used provincial law to encourage the use of French (see [[Charter of the French Language]]) ahead of other languages, while the other provinces have begun to offer more and more services in French and in [[Languages of Canada|other languages besides English]], including [[Languages of Canada#aboriginal languages|aboriginal languages]] and [[immigrant language]]s.<ref name=\"Morton2002\">{{cite book|author=Frederick Lee Morton|title=Law, Politics and the Judicial Process in Canada|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dj_4_H35nmYC&pg=PA509|year=2002|publisher=University of Calgary Press|isbn=978-1-55238-046-8|page=509}}</ref> The [[Amendments to the Constitution of Canada|1982 amendments]] to the [[Constitution of Canada]] included a right of minority-language education that has resulted in policy changes in all of the provinces.

No specific policies were enacted for the other provinces, and no provisions were made for the official languages to be used in other elements of the government such the courts, schools, post offices, and so on. The official language policies of the provinces and territories were initially set when they were created by the federal government, or in the case of provinces that were separate colonies before joining Confederation ([[Dominion of Newfoundland|Newfoundland]], [[History of Prince Edward Island|Prince Edward Island]], and [[History of British Columbia|British Columbia]]) were inherited from their own histories. Language policies in all provinces have evolved over time in response to changing demographics, public attitudes, and legal rulings.\n\n=== The Prairies ===\nPrior to becoming part of Canada in 1869, English was a minority language in the [[Canadian Prairies|Prairies]], where French and Aboriginal languages were more common. The arrival of settlers from [[History of Ontario|Ontario]], the [[British Isles]], and the [[United States]] changed the demographic balance, however. One of the outcomes of the [[Red River Rebellion]] of 1870 was the creation of [[History of Manitoba|Manitoba]] as an officially bilingual province, to protect the French-speaking [[M\u00e9tis people (Canada)|M\u00e9tis]] from being overpowered by the incoming English speaking settlers. This guarantee failed, however, and in the aftermath of the [[Manitoba Schools Question]], that province was allowed to become officially English-only, until these policies were declared unconstitutional in 1985.\n\nThe [[Northwest Territories Act]] of 1891 made English and French official languages in the rest of the [[Western Canada|Canadian West]]. But in 1892 the [[Legislative Assembly of the Northwest Territories|Legislature of the Northwest Territories]] declared itself English-only.\n\nThis trend continued to the creation of the new provinces of [[History of Alberta|Alberta]] and [[History of Saskatchewan|Saskatchewan]] in 1905, and beyond. {{quote|By the time Alberta was made a province in 1905, the French language had been dealt a series of aggressive blows, and the use of French in government, the courts and schools was made illegal.|Alberta Online Encyclopedia<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abheritage.ca/stvincent-stpaul/franco_alta/themes_language_en.html |title=Alberta Online Encyclopedia - Saint Vincent and St. Paul - Language |publisher=Abheritage.ca |date=2010-12-08 |accessdate=2011-11-02}}</ref>}}\n\n== Effect of the ''Charter'' on the provinces and territories ==\n[[Section Twenty-three of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]] guarantees that Canadian-born or educated parents (not recent immigrants) have a right to educate their children in their choice of either French or English wherever there are \"sufficient numbers\". This was a major change in that education is normally considered solely provincial jurisdiction, and policy had been [[Majority rule|majoritarian]]. Court cases such as ''[[Doucet-Boudreau v Nova Scotia (Minister of Education)]]'' have indicated that this is a [[Negative and positive rights|positive right]] that demands timely and sufficient action from the provincial governments.\n\n==Officially bilingual or multilingual provinces/territories==\nNew Brunswick and Canada's three territories have all given official status to more than one language. In the case of New Brunswick, this means perfect equality. In the other cases, the recognition sometimes amounts to a formal recognition of official languages, but limited services in official languages other than English. Manitoba was officially bilingual at its creation, became officially Anglophone only, but this was later reversed by the courts.\n\n=== The territories ===\n{{see also|Franco-T\u00e9nois|Franco-Yukonnais}}\n*[[Northwest Territories]]: [[Chipewyan language|Chipewyan]], [[Cree language|Cree]], English, French, [[Gwich\u2019in language|Gwich\u2019in]], [[Inuinnaqtun]], [[Inuktitut]], [[Inuvialuktun]], [[Slavey language|North Slavey]], South Slavey and [[T\u0142\u0131\u0328ch\u01eb language|T\u0142\u012fch\u01eb or Dogrib]].\n*[[Nunavut]]: English, Inuktitut, Inuinnaqtun, and French.\n*[[Yukon]]: English and French.\n\n=== New Brunswick ===\nNew Brunswick has been officially bilingual in English and French since the passing of the ''[[Official Languages in New Brunswick Act (1969)]]''. This was complemented by ''[[An Act Recognizing the Equality of the Two Official Linguistic Communities in New Brunswick]]'' in 1981. New Brunswick's bilingualism was constitutionally enshrined in the ''Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms'' in 1982. The ''Charter'' was amended in 1993 to clarify that the two language communities are legally equal. In 1999 the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] ruled in ''[[Moncton (City) v. Charlebois]]'' that New Brunswick's official bilingualism also applied to municipalities in the province. In 2002 the ''[[Official Languages Act (New Brunswick)|Official Languages Act]]'' became New Brunswick's new language law, leading to the creation of the [[Office of the Commissioner of Official Languages for New Brunswick]] in 2003.<ref>[http://www.legal-info-legale.nb.ca/en/.../History_of_Language_Rights_ENG.pdf ]{{dead link|date=November 2011}}</ref>\n\n=== Manitoba ===\n{{see also|Franco-Manitoban}}\n{{quote|Manitoba stands out amongst the provinces as a province with a small Francophone linguistic minority but above-average constitutional protection of this minority.|Fraser Institute<ref>Vallincourt et al., viii</ref>}}\nManitoba was established as an officially bilingual province under section 23 of the [[Manitoba Act]], 1870. However, in subsequent years the provincial government moved to end French-language services and become English-only. In the famous Supreme Court of Canada case ''[[Reference Re Manitoba Language Rights]]'' of 1985 the court found these policies unconstitutional. The province of Manitoba is now overwhelmingly English-speaking and the first language of the courts, government ministries, and schools is English. However, in order to comply with the court's ruling the province is required to provide nearly all its services in French (as well as English). The government's policy is summarized in the ''French Language Services Policy'', last updated in March 1999.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.mb.ca/fls-slf/pdf/fls_policy.pdf|format=PDF|title=French-Language Services Policy |date=May 2017|website=Gov.mb.ca|accessdate=25 January 2018}}</ref>\n\n== Regionalized bilingualism: Ontario ==\n{{see also|Franco-Ontarian}}\nOntario has a regionalized language policy, where part of the province is English-only and other areas are bilingual. Province-wide services (such as websites and toll-free telephone numbers) are provided in both English and French. However individuals only have a ''right'' to French-language services in certain designated regions of the province under the ''[[French Language Services Act]]'' (1986). There are 25 regions so designated. These are: areas with 10% or more Francophones; urban centres with 5,000 or more Francophones; and areas previously designated by the [[Government of Ontario]] between 1978 and 1985.<ref name=\"ontario.ca\">{{cite web|url=https://www.ontario.ca/en/communities/francophones/profile/ONT05_024287.html |title=Profile of Ontario's Francophone Community, 2009: Concepts and Definitions |publisher=Ontario.ca |date= |accessdate=2011-11-02}}</ref> Notably this includes [[Toronto]], the provincial capital and Canada's largest municipality (although not all of the [[regional municipalities]] of the [[Greater Toronto Area|GTA]] are included), and the [[National Capital Region (Canada)|National Capital Region]] including [[Ottawa]], as well as many other cities, counties, districts, townships, and towns.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ofa.gov.on.ca/en/flsa-mapdesig.html |title=Government of Ontario - Office of Francophone Affairs: Map of Designated Areas |publisher=Ofa.gov.on.ca |date= |accessdate=2011-11-02}}</ref> For the purposes of the policy, the definition of a \"Francophone\" was broadened in 2009.

English was also used in the legislature, government commissions and courts.\n\n''[[An Act to promote the French language in Qu\u00e9bec]]'' was passed in 1969 by the [[Union Nationale (Quebec)|Union Nationale]] government of [[Jean-Jacques Bertrand]]. It required the [[Ministry of Education, Recreation and Sports (Quebec)|education ministry]] to ensure that French as a [[second language]] was taught to all English-speakers and immigrants in Quebec, but allowed [[Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois (word)|Quebecers]] freedom of choice in deciding in which language to educate their children. This was considered too weak by many [[Quebec nationalism|Quebec nationalists]], leading to the creation of the [[Mouvement Qu\u00e9bec fran\u00e7ais]] and increased support for the new [[Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois]].\n\nFrom 1968 to 1973, the [[Commission of Inquiry on the Situation of the French Language and Linguistic Rights in Quebec]] investigated how to strengthen the position of French in Quebec. Its recommendations led to the passage of the [[Official Language Act (Quebec)|''Official Language Act'']] or \"Bill 22\" in 1974 by the [[Quebec Liberal Party]] government of [[Robert Bourassa]]. This made French the sole official language of Quebec and required its use in business.\n\nBill 22 was replaced by the ''Charter of the French Language'' (Bill 101) by Quebec's [[National Assembly of Quebec|National Assembly]] in August 1977, under the Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois government led by [[Ren\u00e9 L\u00e9vesque]]. It is structured as a list of rights, where everyone in Quebec has the right to be served in French by the government and businesses, and also provides rights for speakers of English and aboriginal languages. Most government services are available in both French and English. Regional institutions in the [[Nunavik]] region of [[Nord-du-Qu\u00e9bec|northern Quebec]] offer services in [[Inuktitut]] and [[Cree language|Cree]].\n\nSeveral legal challenges have been raised against Bill 101 in the ongoing [[legal dispute over Quebec's language policy]]. In 1988, the Supreme Court of Canada ruled in ''[[Ford v Quebec (AG)]]'' that the ban on outdoor signs in languages other than French was unconstitutional. The government of Quebec choose to invoke the \"[[Section Thirty-three of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|notwithstanding clause]]\" to shield the legislation from the courts.

However, Britain eventually gained firm and unchallenged control of the island and adjacent coast following the French defeat in the [[Seven Years' War]], and English then became the language of administration and commerce, as in most of the [[British Empire]]. In isolated fishing villages many minority languages persisted in private use, however, until the coming of standardized education in the 19th, and more so the 20th centuries. When Newfoundland joined Confederation in 1949 it had already used English as the sole language of government for several centuries. Today, Newfoundland is the most linguistically homogeneous province in Canada.
