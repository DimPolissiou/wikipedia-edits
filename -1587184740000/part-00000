Kuro's last egg hatches, giving birth to a baby owl whom Ori, Naru, and Gumo name Ku and, while also continuing their life together, raise her as a family. Ku soon becomes the age to start flying, but being born with a damaged wing, she is unable to until Gumo affixes Kuro's feather to her wing. Ku and Ori go off on a flight, eventually taking them out of Nibel and into Niwen, where a storm causes them to be separated. \n\nRegaining consciousness from the fall, Ori's search for Ku leads them to Kwolok, a toad looking over the Inkwater Marsh and some of Niwen's inhabitants, the Moki. He tells Ori that Ku is in the Silent Woods, the Moki's former home now turned into a desolate graveyard of owls, but with the waters of Niwen unclean, Ori must set the wheels of The Wellspring back into motion to enter the Silent Woods. Kwolok also gives Ori a wisp, the Voice of the Forest, to guide them on their journey. At the same time that Ori enters The Wellspring, Naru and Gumo, realizing where Ori and Ku are, head off to Niwen via a [[raft]] to find them. Upon setting The Wellspring's wheels back into motion, clearing Niwen's water, Ori proceeds to enter the Silent Woods. There they soon reunite with Ku, but shortly after encounters Shriek, a deformed owl ruling over the Silent Woods and terrorizing Niwen who was an orphan at birth and rejected by the rest of her kind, turning her vicious. Shriek attacks the pair and kills Ku.\n\nAfter mourning over Ku, Kwolok explains to Ori that the Voice of the Forest is not at full power and as such, is unable to bring Ku back in its current state. Due to the Spirit Willow's prior passing, the light that it carried was shattered into five wisps that scattered across Niwen, leaving the forest vulnerable to corruption and decay that killed the Willow's guardian spirits and Shriek's parents before her birth. Kwolok tasks Ori with seeking out the other four wisps of the Spirit Willow's light: the Memory, Eyes, Strength, and Heart of the Forest, and merge them with the Voice to reform the tree's light. Kwolok leaves his marsh to help Ori with finding one of the wisps, but his body is forcibly taken over by the Stink Spirit, a creature born out of the forest's decay whose body jamming the wheels of The Wellspring was the cause of it\u2019s non-functionality. Ori breaks the spirit's control over Kwolok, allowing him to kill it but leaving him mortally wounded. Before dying, Kwolok pleads to Ori to restore and protect Niwen in his place.\n\nOri eventually finds all five wisps and merges them together to reform Seir, the Golden Light. Ori and Seir head to the Spirit Willow and Seir revives it. However, the tree tells Ori that its time has passed and it can no longer carry Seir, asking Ori to merge with the light to restore Niwen, though they would have to leave their previous life behind. The Spirit Willow passes Seir onto Ori, but Shriek reappears and snatches it. Ori defeats Shriek, who returns to the Silent Woods and dies in the wings of her parents' husks. \n\nMeanwhile, Ori limps their way over to Seir and merges with it, healing Niwen and reviving Ku with her damaged wing restored in the process, which Naru and Gumo arrive in time to witness. Ku, Naru, and Gumo find where Ori and Seir merged, and they find a Spirit Tree beginning to grow there. They help the tree flourish and continue their life together, with the Spirit Tree revealing that it was Ori all along, retelling the events leading up to when it merged with Seir. Eventually, the tree completely grows and life begins anew as a new spirit guardian falls from it.\n\n== Development and release ==\n\n{{quote box\n| quote = \"A lot of people completed ''Blind Forest'' in roughly eight hours, and thought that it was a positive experience.

To progress through the game, players are tasked with moving between various  platforms and solving intricate puzzles. The game world unfolds to the player in the form of a [[Metroidvania]], with new movement abilities allowing the player to access previously inaccessible areas. Unlike its predecessor ''[[Ori and the Blind Forest|The Blind Forest]]'', ''Will of the Wisps'' relies on autosaving rather than manually placed \"soul links\", and the sequential upgrade system of the first title has been abandoned for a \"shard\" system that allows players to upgrade Ori in various ways, like sticking to walls and those that are equipped can be changed on the fly.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.gamesradar.com/ori-and-the-will-of-the-wisps-is-taking-serious-inspiration-from-zelda-with-its-new-focus-on-fluid-combat/ |title= Ori and the Will of the Wisps is taking serious inspiration from Zelda with its new focus on fluid combat |last= Loveridge |first= Sam |date= February 27, 2020 |accessdate= March 3, 2020 |work= [[GamesRadar+]] |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20200303061750/https://www.gamesradar.com/ori-and-the-will-of-the-wisps-is-taking-serious-inspiration-from-zelda-with-its-new-focus-on-fluid-combat/ |archive-date= March 3, 2020 |url-status= live }}</ref> Some of the foundational gameplay elements were inspired by the ''[[Rayman]]'' and ''[[Metroid]]'' franchises.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.videogamer.com/news/soul-links-in-ori-and-the-will-of-the-wisps-didnt-make-sense-says-developer |title= Soul Links in Ori and the Will of the Wisps \"didn't make sense\", says developer |last= Donovan |first= Imogen |date= March 9, 2020 |accessdate= March 15, 2020 |work= VideoGamer |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20200314191058/https://www.videogamer.com/news/soul-links-in-ori-and-the-will-of-the-wisps-didnt-make-sense-says-developer |archive-date= March 14, 2020 |url-status= live }}</ref>\n\nA new mode called Spirit Trials was revealed at [[Gamescom]] 2018.

Kuro's last egg hatches, giving birth to a baby owl whom Ori, Naru, and Gumo name Ku and, while also continuing their life together, raise her as a family. Ku soon becomes the age to start flying, but being born with a damaged wing, she is unable to until Gumo affixes Kuro's feather to her wing. Ku and Ori go off on a flight, eventually taking them out of Nibel and into Niwen, where a storm causes them to be separated. \n\nRegaining consciousness from the fall, Ori's search for Ku leads them to Kwolok, a toad looking over the Inkwater Marsh and some of Niwen's inhabitants, the Moki. He tells Ori that Ku is in the Silent Woods, the Moki's former home now turned into a desolate graveyard of owls, but with the waters of Niwen unclean, Ori must set the wheels of The Wellspring back into motion to enter the Silent Woods. Kwolok also gives Ori a wisp, the Voice of the Forest, to guide them on their journey. At the same time that Ori enters The Wellspring, Naru and Gumo, realizing where Ori and Ku are, head off to Niwen via a [[raft]] to find them. Upon setting The Wellspring's wheels back into motion, clearing Niwen's water, Ori proceeds to enter the Silent Woods. There they soon reunite with Ku, but shortly after encounters Shriek, a deformed owl ruling over the Silent Woods and terrorizing Niwen who was an orphan at birth and rejected by the rest of her kind, turning her vicious. Shriek attacks the pair and kills Ku.\n\nAfter mourning over Ku, Kwolok explains to Ori that the Voice of the Forest is not at full power and as such, is unable to bring Ku back in its current state. Due to the Spirit Willow's prior passing, the light that it carried was shattered into five wisps that scattered across Niwen, leaving the forest vulnerable to corruption and decay that killed the Willow's guardian spirits and Shriek's parents before her birth. Kwolok tasks Ori with seeking out the other four wisps of the Spirit Willow's light: the Memory, Eyes, Strength, and Heart of the Forest, and merge them with the Voice to reform the tree's light. Kwolok leaves his marsh to help Ori with finding one of the wisps, but his body is forcibly taken over by the Stink Spirit, a creature born out of the forest's decay whose body jamming the wheels of The Wellspring was the cause of it\u2019s non-functionality. Ori breaks the spirit's control over Kwolok, allowing him to kill it but leaving him mortally wounded. Before dying, Kwolok pleads to Ori to restore and protect Niwen in his place.\n\nOri eventually finds all five wisps and merges them together to reform Seir, the Golden Light. Ori and Seir head to the Spirit Willow and Seir revives it. However, the tree tells Ori that its time has passed and it can no longer carry Seir, asking Ori to merge with the light to restore Niwen, though they would have to leave their previous life behind. The Spirit Willow passes Seir onto Ori, but Shriek reappears and snatches it. Ori defeats Shriek, who returns to the Silent Woods and dies in the wings of her parents' husks. \n\nMeanwhile, Ori limps their way over to Seir and merges with it, healing Niwen and reviving Ku with her damaged wing restored in the process, which Naru and Gumo arrive in time to witness. Ku, Naru, and Gumo find where Ori and Seir merged, and they find a Spirit Tree beginning to grow there. They help the tree flourish and continue their life together, with the Spirit Tree revealing that it was Ori all along, retelling the events leading up to when it merged with Seir. Eventually, the tree completely grows and life begins anew as a new spirit guardian falls from it.\n\n== Development and release ==\n\n{{quote box\n| quote = \"A lot of people completed ''Blind Forest'' in roughly eight hours, and thought that it was a positive experience.

He described the game as \"A hallmark of excellence\", saying that \"There may be flaws, but they are negligible and won't cause massive damage\". Carter particularly praised the game's visuals, combat improvements from the game's predecessor, as well as the \"dramatic chase sequences\". However, he mentioned some [[frame rate]] issues regarding the Xbox One version of the game.<ref name=\"Carter\"/> ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]''{{'}}s Michael Goroff stated positive opinions regarding the game, while pointing out the performance issues which the [[Xbox One]] edition of the game suffered from before the day-one [[patch (computing)|patch]] was released. Goroff further mentioned that \"''Ori and the Will of the Wisps'' does everything that a good sequel is supposed to do. It refines ''The Blind Forest''{{'}}s mechanics, expands on the world, and throws in a whole bunch of new moves and concepts. But in an era that's rich with 'emotional platformers', ''Will of the Wisps'' doesn't do anything to make itself stand out. It's a fine, if not forgettable, experience\".<ref name=\"EGMreview\"/> Writing for ''[[Game Informer]]'', Andrew Reiner praised the game's graphics, story and combat, subsequently calling the game better than its predecessor. Reiner said that \"The story is fantastic, the world is breathtaking, and all of that pales in comparison to the wonderfully made gameplay that soars both as a platforming and combat game. Moon Studios has outdone itself with ''Will of the Wisps'', delivering an experience that doesn't have any lulls, makes the player feel clever, and just keeps getting better as it goes.\"<ref name=\"Game Informer\"/> ''[[GameSpot]]''{{'}}s critic Steve Watts gave the game a positive review, commending the combat, exploring elements, story as well as the \"Gorgeous animation and environments\". Moreover, he highlighted occasional visual bugs as negative aspects of the game.<ref name=\"GSreview\"/> \n\nAustin Wood, reviewer for ''[[GamesRadar+]]'', acclaimed the game and its \"breathtaking music\", world and its platforming. Wood stated that \"There are a few minor stumbles here and there, but make no mistake: I ''adore'' ''Ori and The Will of the Wisps''. It's one of the best platformers ever made, and it's an easy front-runner for game of the year. If you liked the first game, you will love this one. And if you haven't experienced Ori's story, you owe it to yourself to dive in now, especially with both games now on Xbox Game Pass. I'll be replaying this game, listening to its soundtrack, and reminiscing over its characters for years to come.\" However, Wood acknowledged some negatives regarding a few of the game's abilities and called the final level \"slightly underwhelming\".<ref name=\"GRadarreview\"/> Brandin Tyrrel of ''[[IGN]]'' also praised the game, saying that \"''Ori and the Will of the Wisps'' is an excellent return to this bright and beautiful open-world platformer, with an affecting story to bolster the white-knuckle challenge.\" Tyrrell further complimented the game for staying true to the original, while at the same time adding more content than its predecessor.<ref name=\"IGNreview\"/> ''[[PC Gamer]]''{{'}}s critic Tyler Wilde gave the game a favorable review, praising the platforming, boss fights and the visuals. Wilde mentioned some criticism regarding the fighting though, saying that \"it's not much fun\".<ref name=\"PCG review\"/> Writing for ''VideoGamer'', Josh Wise acclaimed the game for its graphics, music and platforming, stating that \"In the beauty stakes and beyond, there are very few, in the rarefied realms of indie or AAA, who can challenge it\". However, Wise pointed out some negatives towards the game's plot, calling it \"thin\".<ref name=\"VGreview\"/> Tola Onanuga of ''[[The Guardian]]'' praised the game, saying that \"More than anything else, ''Ori and the Will of the Wisps'' is an intoxicating feast for the senses. From its hauntingly beautiful visuals to its ambient, responsive music, there is so much to love about the look and feel of this long-awaited sequel.\" Onanuga acknowledged some less positive aspects of the game, calling the story \"melancholy at times\" and stating that fighting \"the more common enemies can feel a little tedious after a while\". She ended her review in a positive manner, saying that \"Peppered with devious puzzles, ''Ori and the Will of the Wisp[s]'' is an irresistible challenge.

For example, having sub-teams spread in different [[time zones]] may allow a 24-hour company working day,  if the teams, systems and procedures are well established. A good example is the test team in time zone 8 hours ahead or behind the development team, who fix [[software bug]]s found by the testers.\n\nA professional software company normally consists of at least three dedicated sub-teams :\n*[[Business analyst]]s who define the business needs of the market\n*[[Software developer]]s who create the [[Specification (technical standard)|technical specification]] and write the software\n*[[Software tester]]s who are responsible for the whole process of [[quality management]]\n\nIn bigger software companies, greater specialization is employed, and quite often there are also:\n\n*[[Technical writer]]s who write all the [[Software documentation|documentation]] such as [[user guide]]s\n*Release specialists who are responsible for building the whole product and [[software versioning]]\n*[[User experience design]]ers, who are creating the design architecture based on business requirements, user research and expertise in [[usability]]\n*[[Graphic designer]]s who are normally responsible for the design of the [[graphical user interface]].\n*Maintenance engineers who are behind two, three or more lines of support\n*Consultants responsible for making the solution operational, especially if some specialist knowledge is necessary. Examples of this include: building [[multidimensional cube]]s in [[business intelligence software]], integrating with existing solutions, and implementing business scenarios in [[Business Process Management]] software.\n*In September 2017, Allegion collaborated with Software companies to extend electronic access control options.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.securitysales.com/access/allegion-software-house-collaborate-access-control/|title=Allegion, Software House Collaborate to Extend Electronic Access Control Options|date=2017-09-19|work=Security Sales & Integration|access-date=2017-11-14|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n== Structure ==\n\nThe manager of a software company is usually called the Head Of Development (HOD),<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=XvFxROsje8gC&pg=PA12&dq=%22Head+of+Development%22&hl=pl&sa=X&ei=wUtBT5-lN8mQ-wbrop3aBQ&ved=0CDMQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=%22Head%20of%20Development%22&f=false Greenlit: Developing Factual/Reality TV Ideas from Concept to Pitch p.12]</ref> and reports to the [[Stakeholder|stakeholders]]. He or she leads the sub-teams directly or via the managers/leaders depending on the size of the [[organization]]. Usually teams of up to 10 person are the most operational. In bigger organizations, there are in general two models of the hierarchy:\n\n[[File:SoftwareHouse-ClassicStructure.jpg|none|thumb|550px|Typical structure of a software company]]\n\nAll the teams are fully independent and they work separately on the different projects. The structure is quite simple and all the employees reports to one person, what make the situation quite clear however it is not a good solution in terms of knowledge exchange and optimal usage of human resources.\n\n[[File:SoftwareHouse-MatrixStructure.jpg|thumb|550px|Matrix structure]]\n\nIn this model there are dedicated managers/leaders for each main specialization, \"renting\" their people for particular projects led by product/project managers, who formally or informally buy the people and pay for their time. This leads to each private employee having two bosses \u2013 the product/project manager and the specialized \"resource\" manager. On one hand it optimizes the usage of human resources, on the other hand it may give rise to conflicts about which one manager has priority in the structure.\n\nThere are also a number of variants of these structures, and a number of [[organization]]s have this structure spread and split within various departments and units.\n\n==Methodologies==\n{{main|Software development process}}\nSoftware companies may use a number of various methodologies to produce the code. These can include:\n*the [[waterfall model]], including project management methodologies like [[PRINCE2]]<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=9Oa2MFvhRlMC&printsec=frontcover&dq=prince2&hl=pl&sa=X&ei=y0lBT6WVBpC3hAfrqJjEBQ&sqi=2&ved=0CEoQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=prince2&f=false Managing successful projects with PRINCE2]</ref> or [[PMBoK]]<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=3mvnx1FA8e0C&printsec=frontcover&dq=pmbok&hl=pl&sa=X&ei=TEpBT9vKL8O1hAetyvHmBQ&sqi=2&ved=0CEEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=pmbok&f=false A User's Manual to the PMBOK Guide]</ref>\n*[[agile software development]], such as [[Extreme Programming]]<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=ms9jTEm8aeEC&printsec=frontcover&dq=extreme+programming&hl=pl&sa=X&ei=zkpBT8mDMM7s-gbwxpDRBQ&sqi=2&ved=0CD8Q6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=extreme%20programming&f=false Planning extreme programming]</ref> and [[SCRUM]]<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=RpYX01XVMksC&printsec=frontcover&dq=SCRUM&hl=pl&sa=X&ei=j0pBT9joDNGN-wb84IDRBQ&ved=0CEAQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=SCRUM&f=false Agile Project Management with Scrum]</ref>\n\nThere are also some methodologies which combine both, such as the [[spiral model]], [[Rational Unified Process]] (RUP)<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=7FSf5661dfMC&printsec=frontcover&dq=RUP&hl=pl&sa=X&ei=SEtBT4GdH4WS-wbH5pG1BQ&ved=0CEcQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=RUP&f=false The rational unified process made easy: a practitioner's guide to the RUP]</ref> or [[Microsoft Solutions Framework|MSF]].<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=KiYW_F9xaakC&printsec=frontcover&dq=MSF&hl=pl&sa=X&ei=VEtBT-rwKMOY-wbNy7TPBQ&ved=0CC4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=MSF&f=false Microsoft Solutions Framework (MSF): A Pocket Guide]</ref>\n\n==Product life cycle==\nRegardless of the methodology used, the [[Product lifecycle (engineering)|product life cycle]] always consists of at least three stages:\n*Design \u2013 including both the business and technical specification\n*C \u2013 the development itself\n*Testing \u2013 the quality management\n\nEach stage ideally takes 30% of the total time, with the remaining 10% in reserve.\n\nThe [[Unified Modeling Language|UML]] [[sequence diagram]] of interaction between these groups may look like:\n[[File:SoftwareHouse-GroupsSequence.jpg|none|thumb|550px|The general interaction between the four main groups]]\n\nAt each stage a different group plays a key role, however each type of role must be involved throughout the whole development process:\n*Analysts, after completing the business specification, manage the changing business situation to minimize the possibility of change over time.

For example, having sub-teams spread in different [[time zones]] may allow a 24-hour company working day,  if the teams, systems and procedures are well established. A good example is the test team in time zone 8 hours ahead or behind the development team, who fix [[software bug]]s found by the testers.\n\nA professional software company normally consists of at least three dedicated sub-teams :\n*[[Business analyst]]s who define the business needs of the market\n*[[Software developer]]s who create the technical specification and write the software\n*[[Software tester]]s who are responsible for the whole process of [[quality management]]\n\nIn bigger software companies, greater specialization is employed, and quite often there are also:\n\n*[[Technical writer]]s who write all the [[Software documentation|documentation]] such as [[user guide]]s\n*Release specialists who are responsible for building the whole product and [[software versioning]]\n*[[User experience design]]ers, who are creating the design architecture based on business requirements, user research and expertise in [[usability]]\n*[[Graphic designer]]s who are normally responsible for the design of the [[graphical user interface]].\n*Maintenance engineers who are behind two, three or more lines of support\n*Consultants responsible for making the solution operational, especially if some specialist knowledge is necessary. Examples of this include: building [[multidimensional cube]]s in [[business intelligence software]], integrating with existing solutions, and implementing business scenarios in [[Business Process Management]] software.\n*In September 2017, Allegion collaborated with Software companies to extend electronic access control options.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.securitysales.com/access/allegion-software-house-collaborate-access-control/|title=Allegion, Software House Collaborate to Extend Electronic Access Control Options|date=2017-09-19|work=Security Sales & Integration|access-date=2017-11-14|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n== Structure ==\n\nThe manager of a software company is usually called the Head Of Development (HOD),<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=XvFxROsje8gC&pg=PA12&dq=%22Head+of+Development%22&hl=pl&sa=X&ei=wUtBT5-lN8mQ-wbrop3aBQ&ved=0CDMQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=%22Head%20of%20Development%22&f=false Greenlit: Developing Factual/Reality TV Ideas from Concept to Pitch p.12]</ref> and reports to the stakeholders. He or she leads the sub-teams directly or via the managers/leaders depending on the size of the organization. Usually teams of up to 10 person are the most operational. In bigger organizations, there are in general two models of the hierarchy:\n\n[[File:SoftwareHouse-ClassicStructure.jpg|none|thumb|550px|Typical structure of a software company]]\n\nAll the teams are fully independent and they work separately on the different projects. The structure is quite simple and all the employees reports to one person, what make the situation quite clear however it is not a good solution in terms of knowledge exchange and optimal usage of human resources.\n\n[[File:SoftwareHouse-MatrixStructure.jpg|thumb|550px|Matrix structure]]\n\nIn this model there are dedicated managers/leaders for each main specialization, \"renting\" their people for particular projects led by product/project managers, who formally or informally buy the people and pay for their time. This leads to each private employee having two bosses \u2013 the product/project manager and the specialized \"resource\" manager. On one hand it optimizes the usage of human resources, on the other hand it may give rise to conflicts about which one manager has priority in the structure.\n\nThere are also a number of variants of these structures, and a number of [[organization]]s have this structure spread and split within various departments and units.\n\n==Methodologies==\n{{main|Software development process}}\nSoftware companies may use a number of various methodologies to produce the code.

H. Almaas''' ({{IPAc-en|\u02c8|\u0251\u02d0|l|m|\u0259|s}} {{respell|AHL|m\u0259ss}}) is the pen name of '''A. Hameed Ali''' (born 1944), a [[Kuwaiti American]] author and spiritual teacher who writes about and teaches an approach to spiritual development informed by modern psychology and therapy which he calls the [[Diamond Approach]]. \"''Almaas''\" is the [[Arabic]] word for \"diamond\". \n\nAlmaas is originally from [[Kuwait]]. He is the spiritual head of the Ridhwan School. He may be described, among other things, as an [[Integral theory (philosophy)|Integral theorist]], [[mystic]], [[spiritual teacher]] and an exponent of the [[perennial philosophy]].\n\nAlmaas' books were originally published by the Ridhwan School, under the Diamond Books publishing title, but are now published by [[Shambhala Publications|Shambhala]].\n\nThe Diamond Approach is a contemporary spiritual path integrating the teachings and practices of the ancient wisdom traditions with modern [[depth psychology]] ([[object relations theory]] in particular). The Diamond Approach is derived from the experiences of Almaas, along with Karen Johnson and Faisal Muqaddam (who split off early on to develop his own approach). They were among the first students of [[Claudio Naranjo]], an early pioneer of the integration of spiritual and therapeutic work.\n\nThe curriculum of the work draws upon the founders' backgrounds in [[Sufism]], [[Platonism]], [[Buddhism]] and the [[Fourth Way]]. Teachers of the Diamond Approach focus on the students' specific perception of their own immediate work issues.<ref>https://www.diamondapproach.org/public-page/frequently-asked-questions-faqs#Who_can_teach \"Q: Who can teach the Diamond Approach?\"</ref> Presentation of a canonical body of knowledge and practice is introduced over time as required.\n\n== Life ==\nA. Hameed Ali was born in [[Kuwait]] in 1944. He was a victim of [[polio]] at 18 months old and now walks with a crutch as a result.<ref>{{cite news\n | author=[[Tony Schwartz (author)|Schwartz, Tony]]\n | title = Uncovering The Essential Self\n | work = New Age Journal\n | date = May 1995\n | url =https://www.diamondapproach.org/public-page/uncovering-essential-self\n | accessdate = 16 April 2020\n}}</ref> At the age of 18, he moved to the United States to study at the [[University of California]] in [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]]. Ali was working on his PhD in physics when he reached a turning point in his life that led him more and more into inquiring into the psychological and spiritual aspects of human nature. His interest in the truth of human nature and the true nature of reality resulted in the creation and unfoldment of the Diamond Approach.<ref name=bio>{{cite web|last=Almaas|first=A.H.|title=A. Hameed Ali|url=https://www.diamondapproach.org/public-page/founders|website=diamondapproach.org}}</ref>\n\n== Diamond Approach ==\nThe Diamond Approach is a spiritual teaching that utilizes a distinctive form of inquiry into realization, where the practice is the expression of realization. Its aim is absolute freedom that can be described as living realization, a dynamic enlightenment where transcendent truth lives personally in the world. This inquiry opens up the infinite creativity of our being, transforming our lives into a runaway realization, moving from realization to further realization.<ref>{{cite web|last=Almaas|first=A.H.|title=The Diamond Approach \u2013 Hameed Ali (A. H. Almaas)|url=http://www.ahalmaas.com/|website=ahalmaas.com}}</ref>\n\nThe Ridhwan Foundation is the nonprofit spiritual organization established to support and preserve the integrity of the Diamond Approach teaching. The Ridhwan Foundation is legally recognized as a church and the role of a teacher is equivalent to that of a minister. People are ordained as spiritual teachers of the Ridhwan Foundation, which is the name given to its ministers.\n\n=== Spiritual practice as a phenomenology of being ===\nThe Diamond Approach is described as a \"response to an important need that is being felt in many quarters, a need for a spiritually informed psychology, or conversely, for a psychologically grounded spirituality. This perspective does not separate psychological and spiritual experience, and hence sees no dichotomy between depth psychology and spiritual work... This body of knowledge is not an integration or synthesis of modern depth psychology and traditional spiritual understanding. The inclination to think in terms of integration of the two is due to the prevailing belief in the dichotomy between the fields of psychology and spirituality, a dichotomy in which the Diamond Mind understanding does not participate.\" (Almaas)<ref>Almaas, A. H. ''The Void: Inner Spaciousness and Ego Structure'', Shambhala Publications, Boston MA, 1986.</ref>\n\nThe Diamond Approach, according to its followers, can be called a Phenomenology of Being that offers a precise description of the various aspects and dimensions of Spirit or Being and is also a form of [[Spirituality|spiritual]] psychotherapy which seeks to heal the wounds of the soul by reconnecting it to Spirit.\n\n=== Principal ideas ===\n\n==== Structure of reality ====\nIn the Diamond Approach, reality is seen as consisting of three elements: God/Being/Spirit, Soul/Self and World/Cosmos.\n\n''Being'' is understood as the inner source and true nature of reality, which is the focus of the great spiritual traditions of both East and West, and is known as ''[[Dharmakaya]]'', ''[[Shunyata]]'', ''[[Brahman]]'' or ''[[Tao]]''. Being is understood as consisting of five co-emergent \"boundless dimensions\": Divine Love, Pure Presence, Nonconceptual Awareness, The Logos, and The Absolute.\n\n''Soul'' is understood to be the individual consciousness that connects the world with Being, an idea found in ancient [[Chinese philosophy]]. It is believed in the Diamond Approach that the soul can be experienced as a living presence that contains the thoughts, feelings and sensations usually called our \"self\".\n\n''World'' is understood as the outer manifestation of reality, the multitude of physical forms that all people are familiar with.\n\n==== Essence and the essential aspects ====\nWhile most spiritual paths conceive of Being as universal, the Diamond Approach also pays a great deal of attention to a more individual way of experiencing Being, called Essence. The concept of Essence is similar to the Hindu idea of ''[[Atman (Hinduism)|Atman]]''. While Being is the true nature of all of reality, Essence is the portion of it that forms the true and personal nature of the soul. It is experienced as a substantial fluid Presence which can differentiate into various qualities or aspects, such as compassion, strength, will, joy, peace, love, value, humanness, personalness, identity, and space.<ref>Almaas, A. H. ''Essence'' Weiser Books, Boston MA, 1986.</ref><ref>[http://www.ahalmaas.com/glossary/e/essence.htm Essence & Spiritual Presence] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080707032123/http://www.ahalmaas.com/glossary/e/essence.htm |date=7 July 2008 }}</ref>\n\n==== Theory of holes ====\nAs our soul develops it is faced with a double challenge: it must learn to function in the World, while also remaining connected to Spirit. For various reasons, some innate and others environmental, we slowly become alienated from our Essence through the development of fixed patterns of perception and behaviour known as the personality or ego. Each of these patterns or ego structures disconnects us from a specific Essential Aspect. In other words, it is built around the \"Hole\" of this aspect. By exploring its structure, both cognitively and experientially, one eventually confronts the Hole and by going through it the lost aspect is retrieved.<ref>Ch. 2 \u2013 \"The Theory of Holes.\" Almaas, A. H. ''Diamond Heart Book 1'', Shambhala, 2000.</ref>\n\n=== Methodology ===\nThe Diamond Approach uses methods which its founders learned from Claudio Naranjo. Almaas' scientific background (he studied physics at Berkeley<ref name=bio />) helps explain the emphasis on rigorous (self) inquiry. Several contexts for participation are provided, including regular one-on-one sessions with a trained teacher, seminars and participation in various formats of organized ongoing groups.<ref>[https://www.diamondapproach.org/ways-to-engage Ways to Engage with The Diamond Approach]</ref>\n\n==== Presence ====\nThe practice referred to as \"presence\" is based on two methods, learning to sense one's body (especially one's arms and legs) in an ongoing manner and regularly focusing one's attention on a point in the belly called the \"kath center\" (known in Chinese philosophy as the ''[[dantian]]'' and in Japanese culture as the [[Hara_(tanden)|hara]]). These methods help a person to become more grounded in the body and in physical reality and also, in time, to develop the ability to experience oneself as the presence of Essence.\n\n==== Inquiry ====\nThe Diamond Approach centers on practice of investigation of the self, experience and perception.  \"Inquiry\" answers the question posed by [[Socrates]]: \"How does one set up as the object of one's investigation, that about which one knows nothing?\"{{Citation needed|date=June 2019}}  One starts by wanting to find out, living a question, while recognizing preconceptions, preconditions and expectations as to the nature of what one may learn and instead attending to one's immediate or present experience. While not explicitly acknowledged as such, inquiry in effect combines (as a descriptive mechanism only, as the inquiry process is beyond mere language) the practice of [[Edmund Husserl]]'s \"transcendental phenomenological reduction, or epoch\u00e9\", with [[Sigmund Freud]]'s psychodynamic exploration. An important feature of inquiry is that a person learns to be aware of both the content of experience (emotions, thoughts, sensations) and the attitudes and reactions towards it. In this way the subject-object dichotomy is transcended and one learns to relate to oneself without having to create inner splits. Open-ended inquiry is both a path to, and the state of, a realized person and in time is understood to be a self-revelation of the mysteries of Being.\n\n=== Motivation ===\nThe main motivation for embarking on the spiritual journey in this approach is love for the Truth. \"Truth\" refers to seeing things as they really are, which ultimately comes down to recognizing Being as the true nature of everything. Love for the truth therefore combines the traditional [[bhakti]] and [[jnana]] perspectives on spirituality.<ref>https://www.diamondapproach.org/public-page/frequently-asked-questions-faqs#Goal_of_DA \u2013 \"Q: What is the goal of the Diamond Approach?\"</ref><ref>[http://www.ahalmaas.com/glossary/t/truth.htm Truth] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080725054112/http://www.ahalmaas.com/glossary/t/truth.htm |date=25 July 2008 }}</ref>\n\n== Critiques ==\nThe fees associated with the retreats and other methodologies that are part of the structure of the school have been criticized.<ref name=\"dailyCamera\">{{cite news |url=http://www.dailycamera.com/ci_12960184 |title=New path: Ridhwan teaches new way of looking at the world |date= 17 April 2009 | work=[[Daily Camera]]|accessdate=15 October 2016}}</ref> However, the fees are relatively low compared to other spiritual schools and retreats.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}  Furthermore, the founder and lead teacher, Hameed Ali, regularly points out that the Diamond Approach is only one path to truth and cannot in itself be all-encompassing.  Students are permitted and even encouraged to question the practices of the school and to explore whether the school is a good fit for them personally.\n\nIn addition to the fees associated with the retreats, participants become provisional members of the Ridhwan Foundation (legally a church). After an unspecified designated period of time, they are asked to confirm membership by paying the appropriate membership fees to the foundation. These membership fees are $160/year for students involved in the group teachings and $60/year for provisional members.\n\nThe work of Almaas has received praise from spiritual teachers and explorers such as [[John Welwood]], [[Brant Cortright]], [[Gabor Mat\u00e9]], [[Jack Kornfield]] and [[Ken Wilber]].<ref>Wilber, K. ''Eye of the Spirit'' Shambhala: Boston, 1997 (372-373)</ref> Wilber, while tentatively supportive of the Diamond Approach, disputes some details. For example, he does not agree that infants have essential experiences, maintaining that the infant exists purely in the physical, material world \u2013 \"instinctual, vital, impulsive, narcissistic, egocentric; living for food, its God is all mouth.\"<ref>Wilber, K. ''Eye of the Spirit'' Shambhala: Boston, 1997 (362\u2013363)</ref> Almaas has responded that Wilber's critique demonstrates a misinterpretation based on Wilber's own linear, four-stage categorization of spiritual development. Almaas' perspective is that infants experience a type of true nature/Spirit, but one that is very distinct from, and less integrated than, the experiences of essentially realized adults.<ref>Appendix D in Almaas, A. H. ''The Inner Journey Home'', Shambhala: Boston, 2004.</ref>\n\n== Ridhwan School ==\nThe Ridhwan School is a loosely-knit affiliation of ongoing spiritual groups founded in 1976 by Almaas. The school is dedicated to the teaching of the Diamond Approach. It is principally based in [[Berkeley, California]] and [[Boulder, Colorado]] with other groups throughout North America and in parts of Europe and Australia.   Almaas is the spiritual head of the school and individual groups are taught by qualified Ridhwan teachers.

H. Almaas''' ({{IPAc-en|\u02c8|\u0251\u02d0|l|m|\u0259|s}} {{respell|AHL|m\u0259ss}}) is the pen name of '''A. Hameed Ali''' (born 1944), a [[Kuwaiti American]] author and spiritual teacher who writes about and teaches an approach to spiritual development informed by modern psychology and therapy which he calls the [[Diamond Approach]]. \"''Almaas''\" is the [[Arabic]] word for \"diamond\". \n\nAlmaas is originally from [[Kuwait]]. He is the spiritual head of the Ridhwan School. He may be described, among other things, as an [[Integral theory (philosophy)|Integral theorist]], [[mystic]], [[spiritual teacher]] and an exponent of the [[perennial philosophy]].\n\nAlmaas' books were originally published by the Ridhwan School, under the Diamond Books publishing title, but are now published by [[Shambhala Publications|Shambhala]].\n\nThe Diamond Approach is a contemporary spiritual path integrating the teachings and practices of the ancient wisdom traditions with modern [[depth psychology]] ([[object relations theory]] in particular). The Diamond Approach is derived from the experiences of Almaas, along with Karen Johnson and Faisal Muqaddam (who split off early on to develop his own approach). They were among the first students of [[Claudio Naranjo]], an early pioneer of the integration of spiritual and therapeutic work.\n\nThe curriculum of the work draws upon the founders' backgrounds in [[Sufism]], [[Platonism]], [[Buddhism]] and the [[Fourth Way]]. Teachers of the Diamond Approach focus on the students' specific perception of their own immediate work issues.<ref>https://www.diamondapproach.org/public-page/frequently-asked-questions-faqs#Who_can_teach \"Q: Who can teach the Diamond Approach?\"</ref> Presentation of a canonical body of knowledge and practice is introduced over time as required.\n\n== Life ==\nA. Hameed Ali was born in [[Kuwait]] in 1944. He was a victim of [[polio]] at 18 months old and now walks with a crutch as a result.<ref>{{cite news\n | author=[[Tony Schwartz (author)|Schwartz, Tony]]\n | title = Uncovering The Essential Self\n | work = New Age Journal\n | date = May 1995\n | url =https://www.diamondapproach.org/public-page/uncovering-essential-self\n | accessdate = 16 April 2020\n}}</ref> At the age of 18, he moved to the United States to study at the [[University of California]] in [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]]. Ali was working on his PhD in physics when he reached a turning point in his life that led him more and more into inquiring into the psychological and spiritual aspects of human nature. His interest in the truth of human nature and the true nature of reality resulted in the creation and unfoldment of the Diamond Approach.<ref name=bio>{{cite web|last=Almaas|first=A.H.|title=A. Hameed Ali|url=https://www.diamondapproach.org/public-page/founders|website=diamondapproach.org}</ref>\n\n== Diamond Approach ==\nThe Diamond Approach is a spiritual teaching that utilizes a distinctive form of inquiry into realization, where the practice is the expression of realization. Its aim is absolute freedom that can be described as living realization, a dynamic enlightenment where transcendent truth lives personally in the world. This inquiry opens up the infinite creativity of our being, transforming our lives into a runaway realization, moving from realization to further realization.<ref>{{cite web|last=Almaas|first=A.H.|title=The Diamond Approach \u2013 Hameed Ali (A. H. Almaas)|url=http://www.ahalmaas.com/|website=ahalmaas.com}}</ref>\n\nThe Ridhwan Foundation is the nonprofit spiritual organization established to support and preserve the integrity of the Diamond Approach teaching. The Ridhwan Foundation is legally recognized as a church and the role of a teacher is equivalent to that of a minister. People are ordained as spiritual teachers of the Ridhwan Foundation, which is the name given to its ministers.\n\n=== Spiritual practice as a phenomenology of being ===\nThe Diamond Approach is described as a \"response to an important need that is being felt in many quarters, a need for a spiritually informed psychology, or conversely, for a psychologically grounded spirituality. This perspective does not separate psychological and spiritual experience, and hence sees no dichotomy between depth psychology and spiritual work... This body of knowledge is not an integration or synthesis of modern depth psychology and traditional spiritual understanding. The inclination to think in terms of integration of the two is due to the prevailing belief in the dichotomy between the fields of psychology and spirituality, a dichotomy in which the Diamond Mind understanding does not participate.\" (Almaas)<ref>Almaas, A. H. ''The Void: Inner Spaciousness and Ego Structure'', Shambhala Publications, Boston MA, 1986.</ref>\n\nThe Diamond Approach, according to its followers, can be called a Phenomenology of Being that offers a precise description of the various aspects and dimensions of Spirit or Being and is also a form of [[Spirituality|spiritual]] psychotherapy which seeks to heal the wounds of the soul by reconnecting it to Spirit.\n\n=== Principal ideas ===\n\n==== Structure of reality ====\nIn the Diamond Approach, reality is seen as consisting of three elements: God/Being/Spirit, Soul/Self and World/Cosmos.\n\n''Being'' is understood as the inner source and true nature of reality, which is the focus of the great spiritual traditions of both East and West, and is known as ''[[Dharmakaya]]'', ''[[Shunyata]]'', ''[[Brahman]]'' or ''[[Tao]]''. Being is understood as consisting of five co-emergent \"boundless dimensions\": Divine Love, Pure Presence, Nonconceptual Awareness, The Logos, and The Absolute.\n\n''Soul'' is understood to be the individual consciousness that connects the world with Being, an idea found in ancient [[Chinese philosophy]]. It is believed in the Diamond Approach that the soul can be experienced as a living presence that contains the thoughts, feelings and sensations usually called our \"self\".\n\n''World'' is understood as the outer manifestation of reality, the multitude of physical forms that all people are familiar with.\n\n==== Essence and the essential aspects ====\nWhile most spiritual paths conceive of Being as universal, the Diamond Approach also pays a great deal of attention to a more individual way of experiencing Being, called Essence. The concept of Essence is similar to the Hindu idea of ''[[Atman (Hinduism)|Atman]]''. While Being is the true nature of all of reality, Essence is the portion of it that forms the true and personal nature of the soul. It is experienced as a substantial fluid Presence which can differentiate into various qualities or aspects, such as compassion, strength, will, joy, peace, love, value, humanness, personalness, identity, and space.<ref>Almaas, A. H. ''Essence'' Weiser Books, Boston MA, 1986.</ref><ref>[http://www.ahalmaas.com/glossary/e/essence.htm Essence & Spiritual Presence] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080707032123/http://www.ahalmaas.com/glossary/e/essence.htm |date=7 July 2008 }}</ref>\n\n==== Theory of holes ====\nAs our soul develops it is faced with a double challenge: it must learn to function in the World, while also remaining connected to Spirit. For various reasons, some innate and others environmental, we slowly become alienated from our Essence through the development of fixed patterns of perception and behaviour known as the personality or ego. Each of these patterns or ego structures disconnects us from a specific Essential Aspect. In other words, it is built around the \"Hole\" of this aspect. By exploring its structure, both cognitively and experientially, one eventually confronts the Hole and by going through it the lost aspect is retrieved.<ref>Ch. 2 \u2013 \"The Theory of Holes.\" Almaas, A. H. ''Diamond Heart Book 1'', Shambhala, 2000.</ref>\n\n=== Methodology ===\nThe Diamond Approach uses methods which its founders learned from Claudio Naranjo. Almaas' scientific background (he studied physics at Berkeley<ref name=bio />) helps explain the emphasis on rigorous (self) inquiry. Several contexts for participation are provided, including regular one-on-one sessions with a trained teacher, seminars and participation in various formats of organized ongoing groups.<ref>[https://www.diamondapproach.org/ways-to-engage Ways to Engage with The Diamond Approach]</ref>\n\n==== Presence ====\nThe practice referred to as \"presence\" is based on two methods, learning to sense one's body (especially one's arms and legs) in an ongoing manner and regularly focusing one's attention on a point in the belly called the \"kath center\" (known in Chinese philosophy as the ''[[dantian]]'' and in Japanese culture as the [[Hara_(tanden)|hara]]). These methods help a person to become more grounded in the body and in physical reality and also, in time, to develop the ability to experience oneself as the presence of Essence.\n\n==== Inquiry ====\nThe Diamond Approach centers on practice of investigation of the self, experience and perception.  \"Inquiry\" answers the question posed by [[Socrates]]: \"How does one set up as the object of one's investigation, that about which one knows nothing?\"{{Citation needed|date=June 2019}}  One starts by wanting to find out, living a question, while recognizing preconceptions, preconditions and expectations as to the nature of what one may learn and instead attending to one's immediate or present experience. While not explicitly acknowledged as such, inquiry in effect combines (as a descriptive mechanism only, as the inquiry process is beyond mere language) the practice of [[Edmund Husserl]]'s \"transcendental phenomenological reduction, or epoch\u00e9\", with [[Sigmund Freud]]'s psychodynamic exploration. An important feature of inquiry is that a person learns to be aware of both the content of experience (emotions, thoughts, sensations) and the attitudes and reactions towards it. In this way the subject-object dichotomy is transcended and one learns to relate to oneself without having to create inner splits. Open-ended inquiry is both a path to, and the state of, a realized person and in time is understood to be a self-revelation of the mysteries of Being.\n\n=== Motivation ===\nThe main motivation for embarking on the spiritual journey in this approach is love for the Truth. \"Truth\" refers to seeing things as they really are, which ultimately comes down to recognizing Being as the true nature of everything. Love for the truth therefore combines the traditional [[bhakti]] and [[jnana]] perspectives on spirituality.<ref>https://www.diamondapproach.org/public-page/frequently-asked-questions-faqs#Goal_of_DA \u2013 \"Q: What is the goal of the Diamond Approach?\"</ref><ref>[http://www.ahalmaas.com/glossary/t/truth.htm Truth] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080725054112/http://www.ahalmaas.com/glossary/t/truth.htm |date=25 July 2008 }}</ref>\n\n== Critiques ==\nThe fees associated with the retreats and other methodologies that are part of the structure of the school have been criticized.<ref name=\"dailyCamera\">{{cite news |url=http://www.dailycamera.com/ci_12960184 |title=New path: Ridhwan teaches new way of looking at the world |date= 17 April 2009 | work=[[Daily Camera]]|accessdate=15 October 2016}}</ref> However, the fees are relatively low compared to other spiritual schools and retreats.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}  Furthermore, the founder and lead teacher, Hameed Ali, regularly points out that the Diamond Approach is only one path to truth and cannot in itself be all-encompassing.  Students are permitted and even encouraged to question the practices of the school and to explore whether the school is a good fit for them personally.\n\nIn addition to the fees associated with the retreats, participants become provisional members of the Ridhwan Foundation (legally a church). After an unspecified designated period of time, they are asked to confirm membership by paying the appropriate membership fees to the foundation. These membership fees are $160/year for students involved in the group teachings and $60/year for provisional members.\n\nThe work of Almaas has received praise from spiritual teachers and explorers such as [[John Welwood]], [[Brant Cortright]], [[Gabor Mat\u00e9]], [[Jack Kornfield]] and [[Ken Wilber]].<ref>Wilber, K. ''Eye of the Spirit'' Shambhala: Boston, 1997 (372-373)</ref> Wilber, while tentatively supportive of the Diamond Approach, disputes some details. For example, he does not agree that infants have essential experiences, maintaining that the infant exists purely in the physical, material world \u2013 \"instinctual, vital, impulsive, narcissistic, egocentric; living for food, its God is all mouth.\"<ref>Wilber, K. ''Eye of the Spirit'' Shambhala: Boston, 1997 (362\u2013363)</ref> Almaas has responded that Wilber's critique demonstrates a misinterpretation based on Wilber's own linear, four-stage categorization of spiritual development. Almaas' perspective is that infants experience a type of true nature/Spirit, but one that is very distinct from, and less integrated than, the experiences of essentially realized adults.<ref>Appendix D in Almaas, A. H. ''The Inner Journey Home'', Shambhala: Boston, 2004.</ref>\n\n== Ridhwan School ==\nThe Ridhwan School is a loosely-knit affiliation of ongoing spiritual groups founded in 1976 by Almaas. The school is dedicated to the teaching of the Diamond Approach. It is principally based in [[Berkeley, California]] and [[Boulder, Colorado]] with other groups throughout North America and in parts of Europe and Australia.   Almaas is the spiritual head of the school and individual groups are taught by qualified Ridhwan teachers. The name of the school derives from the Arabic word for \"contentment\":\n\n<blockquote>\"Ridhwan is a kind of contentment which arises when you're liberated. Your personality becomes contented when you're free. Your personality itself is free from its suffering and conflict.\"<ref>''Diamond Heart, Book 2'', pg. 11 \u2013 [https://www.diamondapproach.org/glossary/refinery_phrases/ridhwan Book Excerpts about Ridhwan]</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe school rejects \"quick fixes\" and graduation, and the students are engaged in learning and therapy for an indefinite period.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=NewsLibrary&p_multi=CSGB&d_place=CSGB&p_theme=newslibrary2&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0F34BBA41766BD2A&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM |title=Treating the Soul for Life: School rejects 'quick fixes' |date= 23 October 1992 | work=[[The Gazette (Colorado Springs)]]|accessdate=12 July 2008}}</ref>\n\n== Bibliography ==\n*''The Elixir of Enlightenment'', 1984, [[Weiser Books|Red Wheel Weiser]], {{ISBN|978-0-87728-613-4}}\n*''Essence: The Diamond Approach to Inner Realization'', 1986, [[Weiser Books|Red Wheel Weiser]], {{ISBN|0-87728-627-2}}\n*''Essence with The Elixir of Enlightenment: The Diamond Approach to Inner Realization'', 1998, [[Weiser Books]], {{ISBN|1-57863-044-4}}\n*''Facets of Unity: The Enneagram of Holy Ideas'', 2000, [[Shambhala Publications|Shambhala]], {{ISBN|978-0-936713-14-4}}\n*''Luminous Night's Journey: An Autobiographical Fragment'', 2000, [[Shambhala Publications|Shambhala]], {{ISBN|978-0-936713-08-3}}\n*''The Inner Journey Home: Soul's Realization of the Unity of Reality'', 2004, [[Shambhala Publications|Shambhala]], {{ISBN|978-1-59030-109-8}}\n*''The Power of Divine Eros''.

One SASR operator recalled \"We watched the heat dissipate from his shit in the cold of night.\"<ref name=\":3\" /> Hastie's men deployed to make the capture by Bushmasters, along with a Wakunish force element. These were special-forces-like soldiers from the North of Afghanistan, whom Hastie held in high regard. \"The Wakunish were disciplined. They were tactically proficient. They were sensitive to the populace...\" They encircled the target and attacked at first light, as per their rules of engagement for this context. The entire mission was observed by the commander of all Special Operations Forces for [[International Security Assistance Force]], Brigadeer Bill Dechow, who \"watched on as the Wakunish made entry and captured the senior objective without bloodshed.\" Hastie regarded it as exemplary of the kind of work special forces could achieve, \"surgical and sensitive to locals.

He sort of nodded and gave me a warm sympathetic smile and said, \"I forgive you.\"<ref name=\"heraldsun.com.au\" /></blockquote>For Hastie, the death of the boys was both personally affecting and a turning point in his political outlook:<blockquote>I just felt sick... It was arrogant to think we could build a mirror image of ourselves in foreign lands. [The boys\u2019 deaths] underscored the gap between our aims and reality. The two boys who perished were bystanders in this larger struggle. I was humbled and chastened by this experience. War is a miserable enterprise.

Suicide bomber capture ====\nIntelligence gathering operations constantly scanned for \"chatter\" on plans for suicide bombings by the Taliban.

One of the first missions with the PRC was to capture a suicide bomber in [[Urozgan Province|Urozgan]] before he had the opportunity to attack. The operation was conducted in darkness \"When they found the suicide bomber they were chasing, a barrel pressed against his temple was used to ease the man awake.\"<ref name=\":2\" /> Now the enemy was secure, along with his explosive vest, and rockets, the PRC commanders, and their own magistrate, had a stand off with Hastie \u2014 insisting that they should execute the captured man.<ref name=\":2\" /> The \"person under confinement\" was escorted to prison by Hastie and his team. \n\n==== 5. Truck bomb ====\nHastie's B Company received intelligence of a Taliban plan to use a truck to enter their own [[Forward operating base]].<ref name=\":2\" /> The order was given for all personnel to put on armour and helmets if they were moving outside of secure buildings. An airstrike was considered once the exact location of the bomber was found, however, it was decided to neutralise the threat using Hastie's unit, on the ground. The force element was flown in on two Australian [[Sikorsky UH-60 Black Hawk|Black Hawk]]<nowiki/>s<ref name=\":2\" /> the bomber located and killed, and the team extracted. From wheels down to wheels up had taken 22 minutes. There were no force injuries or casualties. For Hastie:<blockquote>It was the SOTG machine at its most efficient and precise. When we got back and the order was given to all on base that they could take off the body armour and helmets when outside there was a sigh of relief. There was no doubt about that mission. We were protecting the base from attack. We just thought of Aussie diggers, aid workers, [[Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (Australia)|DFAT]] and everyone else supporting us behind the wire.

And that the environment serves the community, which means they need to make the decisions about it. In a recent controversy about a proposed dredging of an estuary, Hastie said: <blockquote>\"I believe in the sovereignty of local communities to make decisions about how they conserve and develop their environment. The Bindjareb people, the First Australians in my constituency, have long been custodians of the waterways\u2014for many generations back to the present. The Murray Mandurah community also shares this responsibility, and together we are all stewards of the beautiful Peel-Harvey Estuary, a body of water larger than Sydney Harbour, teeming with marine life and brimming with natural beauty. We, therefore, through our local governments, have sovereignty over this natural asset and should have a say about how development takes place.

One SASR operator recalled \"We watched the heat dissipate from his shit in the cold of night.\"<ref name=\":3\" /> Hastie's men deployed to make the capture by Bushmasters, along with a Wakunish force element. These were special-forces-like soldiers from the North of Afghanistan, whom Hastie held in high regard. \"The Wakunish were disciplined. They were tactically proficient. They were sensitive to the populace...\" They encircled the target and attacked at first light, as per their rules of engagement for this context. The entire mission was observed by the commander of all Special Operations Forces for [[International Security Assistance Force]], Brigadeer Bill Dechow, who \"watched on as the Wakunish made entry and captured the senior objective without bloodshed.\" Hastie regarded it as exemplary of the kind of work special forces could achieve, \"surgical and sensitive to locals.

It was arrogant to think we could build a mirror image of ourselves in foreign lands. [The boys\u2019 deaths] underscored the gap between our aims and reality. The two boys who perished were bystanders in this larger struggle. I was humbled and chastened by this experience. War is a miserable enterprise.

One of the first missions with the PRC was to capture a suicide bomber in [[Urozgan Province|Urozgan]] before he had the opportunity to attack. The operation was conducted in darkness \"When they found the suicide bomber they were chasing, a barrel pressed against his temple was used to ease the man awake.\"<ref name=\":2\" /> Now the enemy was secure, along with his explosive vest, and rockets, the PRC commanders, and their own magistrate, had a stand off with Hastie \u2014 insisting that they should execute the captured man.<ref name=\":2\" /> The \"person under confinement\" was escorted to prison by Hastie and his team. \n\n==== 5. Truck bomb ====\nHastie's B Company received intelligence of a Taliban plan to use a truck to enter their own [[Forward operating base]].<ref name=\":2\" /> The order was given for all personnel to put on armour and helmets if they were moving outside of secure buildings. An airstrike was considered once the exact location of the bomber was found, however, it was decided to neutralise the threat using Hastie's unit, on the ground. The force element was flown in on two Australian [[Sikorsky UH-60 Black Hawk|Black Hawk]]<nowiki/>s<ref name=\":2\" /> the bomber located and killed, and the team extracted. From wheels down to wheels up had taken 22 minutes. There were no force injuries or casualties. For Hastie:<blockquote>It was the SOTG machine at its most efficient and precise. When we got back and the order was given to all on base that they could take off the body armour and helmets when outside there was a sigh of relief. There was no doubt about that mission. We were protecting the base from attack. We just thought of Aussie diggers, aid workers, [[Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (Australia)|DFAT]] and everyone else supporting us behind the wire.

And that the environment serves the community, which means they need to make the decisions about it. In a recent controversy about a proposed dredging of an estuary, Hastie said: <blockquote>\"I believe in the sovereignty of local communities to make decisions about how they conserve and develop their environment. The Bindjareb people, the First Australians in my constituency, have long been custodians of the waterways\u2014for many generations back to the present. The Murray Mandurah community also shares this responsibility, and together we are all stewards of the beautiful Peel-Harvey Estuary, a body of water larger than Sydney Harbour, teeming with marine life and brimming with natural beauty. We, therefore, through our local governments, have sovereignty over this natural asset and should have a say about how development takes place. We're not antiprogress, but we are rightly cautious about development, as we are the ones most affected by it.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.openaustralia.org.au/debates/?id=2019-09-11.151.1&s=speaker:10843#g151.2|title=Peel-Harvey Estuary: 11 Sep 2019: House debates (OpenAustralia.org)|website=www.openaustralia.org.au|access-date=2019-12-18}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Personal life==\n[[File:AH with family (KN).jpg|thumb|Ruth and Andrew Hastie with their children in Mandurah, October 2018]]\nHastie met his wife Ruth in the summer of 2007 while he was studying at [[George Washington University]].

It can also be said to operate either ''upwards'' or ''downwards'' (or neither). It operates upwards when the antecedent appears in a clause that is [[subordinate clause|subordinate]] to the clause containing the ellipsis, and downwards when the ellipsis appears in a clause subordinate to the clause containing the antecedent. In the above examples, the two clauses are [[coordination (grammar)|coordinated]], so neither is subordinate to the other, and hence the operation of the ellipsis is neither upward nor downward.\n\nCombinations of these directions of operation of ellipsis are illustrated with the following examples:\n\n:: The people who say they will '''help''' never do <sub>help</sub>. <small>- Forwards and upwards</small>\n:: The people who say they will <sub>help</sub> never do '''help'''. <small>- Backwards and downwards</small>\n\n:: The people never do '''help''', who say they will <sub>help</sub>. <small>- Forwards and downwards</small>\n:: *The people never do <sub>help</sub>, who say they will '''help'''. <small>- Backwards and upwards</small>\n\nThree of the four combinations are acceptable.

The phenomenon is called '''antecedent-contained ellipsis''' or '''antecedent-contained deletion'''. Canonical cases of antecedent-contained ellipsis occur when the ellipsis appears inside a quantified object NP, e.g.\n\n::They '''said everything that we did <sub>say</sub>'''.\n::He is '''thinking the same thing I am <sub>thinking</sub>'''.\n\nIf it is assumed that the antecedent to the ellipsis is to be a complete verb phrase, then the only possible antecedent appears to be the VP in bold. This VP, however, contains the ellipsis itself. This analysis would imply an [[infinite regress]], which is an impossibility, since it would mean that the ellipsis could never acquire full semantic content.\n\nOne means of addressing antecedent-contained ellipsis that is pursued in some [[phrase structure grammar]]s is to assume quantifier [[raising (linguistics)|raising]] (QR).<ref>For accounts of antecedent contained deletion in terms of quantifier raising, see for instance Kennedy (1997) and Wilder (2003).</ref> Quantifier raising raises the quantified NP to a position where it is no longer contained inside its antecedent VP.
