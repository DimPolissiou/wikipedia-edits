{"title_page": "Forts in Sri Lanka", "text_new": "{{Forts in Sri Lanka map}}\n\n'''[[Fort]]s and [[fortification]]s in [[Sri Lanka]]''' date back thousands of years with many being built by Sri Lankan Kings, these include several walled cities. With the out set of colonial rule in the [[Indian Ocean]], Sri Lanka was occupied by several major colonial empires that from time-to-time became the dominant power in the Indian Ocean. The colonists built several western styled forts, mostly in and round the cost of the island. The first to build colonial forts in Sri Lanka were the [[Portugal|Portuguese]], these forts were captured and later expanded by the [[Netherlands|Dutch]]. The [[United Kingdom|British]] occupied these  Dutch forts during the [[Napoleonic wars]].\n\nMost of colonial forts were garrisoned up until the early 20th century. The coastal forts had [[coastal artillery]] manned by the [[Ceylon Garrison Artillery]] during the two world wars. Most of these were abandoned by the military, but retained civil administrative officers, while others retained military garrisons, which were more administrative than operational. Some were reoccupied by military units with the escalation of the [[Sri Lankan Civil War]], Jaffna fort for example came under siege several times.\n{{clear}}\n\n== Ancient forts ==\n{| style=\"text-align:center; width:100%\" class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

With the out set of colonial rule in the [[Indian Ocean]], Sri Lanka was occupied by several major colonial empires that from time-to-time became the dominant power in the Indian Ocean. The colonists built several western styled forts, mostly in and round the cost of the island. The first to build colonial forts in Sri Lanka were the [[Portugal|Portuguese]], these forts were captured and later expanded by the [[Netherlands|Dutch]]. The [[United Kingdom|British]] occupied these  Dutch forts during the [[Napoleonic wars]].\n\nMost of colonial forts were garrisoned up until the early 20th century. The coastal forts had [[coastal artillery]] manned by the [[Ceylon Garrison Artillery]] during the two world wars. Most of these were abandoned by the military, but retained civil administrative officers, while others retained military garrisons, which were more administrative than operational. Some were reoccupied by military units with the escalation of the [[Sri Lankan Civil War]], Jaffna fort for example came under siege several times.\n{{clear}}\n\n== Ancient forts ==\n{| style=\"text-align:center; width:100%\" class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

The good news is that Lies is a lot more interesting than that... The calm folk-rock melodies of these four acoustic songs reveal yet another welcome facet of Guns n\u2019 Roses.

The good news is that Lies is a lot more interesting than that... The calm folk-rock melodies of these four acoustic songs reveal yet another welcome facet of Guns n\u2019 Roses.

The new songs are considerably more problematic. \"Patience\" is Guns N' Roses at their prettiest and their sappiest, the most direct song they recorded to date.

He is the current manager of [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]].\n\nBorn in [[Corbridge]], Northumberland, he was a promising schoolboy footballer but was rejected by several professional clubs. He was on the verge of quitting the game altogether when he was offered a trial with [[Gillingham F.C.|Gillingham]]. Bruce was offered an apprenticeship and went on to play more than 200&nbsp;games for the club before joining [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]] in 1984, winning the [[1985 Football League Cup Final|League Cup in 1985]]. In 1987, he moved to [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]], with whom he achieved great success, winning twelve trophies including three [[Premier League]] titles, three [[FA Cup]]s, one [[EFL Cup|League Cup]] and the [[European Cup Winners' Cup]]. He also became the first English player of the 20th century to captain a team to [[Double (association football)|the Double]]. Despite his success on the field, he was never selected to play for the [[England national football team|England national team]]. Commentators and contemporaries have described him as one of the best English players of the 1980s and 1990s never to play for his country at full international level.\n\nBruce began his managerial career with [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]], and spent short periods of time managing [[Huddersfield Town A.F.C.|Huddersfield Town]], [[Wigan Athletic F.C.|Wigan Athletic]] and [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]] before joining [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]] in 2001. He twice led Birmingham to [[Promotion and relegation|promotion]] to the Premier League during his tenure of nearly six years, but resigned in 2007 to begin a second spell as manager of Wigan. At the end of the [[2008\u201309 in English football|2008\u201309 season]] he resigned to take over as manager of [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]], a post he held until he was dismissed in November 2011. Seven months later, he was appointed manager of [[Hull City A.F.C.|Hull City]] and led the club to two promotions to the Premier League, as well as the [[2014 FA Cup Final]], before leaving in July 2016. He took over at [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] four months later but was dismissed in October 2018. He took over as manager of Sheffield Wednesday in February 2019 and left in July that year to take over at Newcastle United.<ref name=\"newcastle-appoint\">{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jul/17/newcastle-appoint-steve-bruce-manager-rafael-benitez|title=Newcastle appoint Steve Bruce as manager to succeed Rafael Ben\u00edtez|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=17 July 2019|accessdate=17 July 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Early life==\n[[File:corbridge uk.jpg|thumb|left|[[Corbridge]], Bruce's place of birth]]\n\nBruce was born in [[Corbridge]] in Northumberland, the elder of two sons of Joe and Sheenagh Bruce.<ref>Bruce (1994), p. 33.</ref> His father was local, and his mother had been born in [[Bangor, County Down|Bangor]] in Northern Ireland.<ref name=\"Ireland\">{{cite news |first=Ian |last=Parkes |title=Blues defender Bruce opts for green shirt of Ireland |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2006/feb/23/newsstory.sport3 |newspaper=The Guardian |location=London |date=23 February 2006 |accessdate=5 January 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"Vital\">{{cite news |title=Bruce in the middle |newspaper=Evening Star |location=Ipswich |url=http://www.eveningstar.co.uk/content/eveningstar/sport/story.aspx?brand=ESTOnline&category=Sport&tBrand=estonline&tCategory=Sport&itemid=IPED04%20Sep%202007%2009%3A37%3A27%3A587 |date=4 September 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080610191103/http://www.eveningstar.co.uk/content/eveningstar/sport/story.aspx?brand=ESTOnline&category=Sport&tBrand=estonline&tCategory=Sport&itemid=IPED04%20Sep%202007%2009%3A37%3A27%3A587 |archivedate=10 June 2008}}</ref> The family lived in Daisy Hill near [[Wallsend]],<ref>Bruce (1994), p. 34.</ref> and Bruce attended [[Benfield School]].<ref name=\"SB38\">Bruce (1994), p. 38.</ref>\n\nBruce, a boyhood fan of [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]], said that he sneaked into [[St James' Park]] without paying to watch the team play, saying \"I have always been a [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]] lad and when I was a kid, I crawled under the turnstiles to get in to try and save a [[Shilling|bob]] or whatever it was.

He is the current manager of [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]].\n\nBorn in [[Corbridge]], Northumberland, he was a promising schoolboy footballer but was rejected by several professional clubs. He was on the verge of quitting the game altogether when he was offered a trial with [[Gillingham F.C.|Gillingham]]. Bruce was offered an apprenticeship and went on to play more than 200&nbsp;games for the club before joining [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]] in 1984, winning the [[1985 Football League Cup Final|League Cup in 1985]]. In 1987, he moved to [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]], with whom he achieved great success, winning twelve trophies including three [[Premier League]] titles, three [[FA Cup]]s, one [[EFL Cup|League Cup]] and the [[European Cup Winners' Cup]]. He also became the first English player of the 20th century to captain a team to [[Double (association football)|the Double]]. Despite his success on the field, he was never selected to play for the [[England national football team|England national team]]. Commentators and contemporaries have described him as one of the best English players of the 1980s and 1990s never to play for his country at full international level.\n\nBruce began his managerial career with [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]], and spent short periods of time managing [[Huddersfield Town A.F.C.|Huddersfield Town]], [[Wigan Athletic F.C.|Wigan Athletic]] and [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]] before joining [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]] in 2001. He twice led Birmingham to [[Promotion and relegation|promotion]] to the Premier League during his tenure of nearly six years, but resigned in 2007 to begin a second spell as manager of Wigan. At the end of the [[2008\u201309 in English football|2008\u201309 season]] he resigned to take over as manager of [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]], a post he held until he was dismissed in November 2011. Seven months later, he was appointed manager of [[Hull City A.F.C.|Hull City]] and led the club to two promotions to the Premier League, as well as the [[2014 FA Cup Final]], before leaving in July 2016. He took over at [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] four months later but was dismissed in October 2018. He took over as manager of Sheffield Wednesday in February 2019 and left in July that year to take over at Newcastle United.<ref name=\"newcastle-appoint\">{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jul/17/newcastle-appoint-steve-bruce-manager-rafael-benitez|title=Newcastle appoint Steve Bruce as manager to succeed Rafael Ben\u00edtez|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=17 July 2019|accessdate=17 July 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Early life==\n[[File:corbridge uk.jpg|thumb|left|[[Corbridge]], Bruce's place of birth]]\n\nBruce was born in [[Corbridge]] in Northumberland, the elder of two sons of Joe and Sheenagh Bruce.<ref>Bruce (1994), p. 33.</ref> His father was local, and his mother had been born in [[Bangor, County Down|Bangor]] in Northern Ireland.<ref name=\"Ireland\">{{cite news |first=Ian |last=Parkes |title=Blues defender Bruce opts for green shirt of Ireland |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2006/feb/23/newsstory.sport3 |newspaper=The Guardian |location=London |date=23 February 2006 |accessdate=5 January 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"Vital\">{{cite news |title=Bruce in the middle |newspaper=Evening Star |location=Ipswich |url=http://www.eveningstar.co.uk/content/eveningstar/sport/story.aspx?brand=ESTOnline&category=Sport&tBrand=estonline&tCategory=Sport&itemid=IPED04%20Sep%202007%2009%3A37%3A27%3A587 |date=4 September 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080610191103/http://www.eveningstar.co.uk/content/eveningstar/sport/story.aspx?brand=ESTOnline&category=Sport&tBrand=estonline&tCategory=Sport&itemid=IPED04%20Sep%202007%2009%3A37%3A27%3A587 |archivedate=10 June 2008}}</ref> The family lived in Daisy Hill near [[Wallsend]],<ref>Bruce (1994), p. 34.</ref> and Bruce attended [[Benfield School]].<ref name=\"SB38\">Bruce (1994), p. 38.</ref>\n\nBruce, a boyhood fan of [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]], said that he sneaked into [[St James' Park]] without paying to watch the team play, saying \"I have always been a [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]] lad and when I was a kid, I crawled under the turnstiles to get in to try and save a [[Shilling|bob]] or whatever it was.

The first St. Joseph's Church was built on the northeast corner of [[Streets of Albany, New York#Pearl Street|North Pearl Street]] and Lumber Street (today Livingston Avenue). Built in 1842 and dedicated in 1843 at a cost of $28,000, it soon became too small for its growing congregation.

Daily figures for American and Canadian light rail systems are \"average weekday ''unlinked'' passenger trips\" (where transfers between lines are counted as two separate passenger \"boardings\" or \"trips\"), unless otherwise indicated. For light rail systems in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]], these figures come from the [[American Public Transit Association]] (APTA) Ridership Reports statistics. For Mexico, the figures are obtained from Banco de Informaci\u00f3n Econ\u00f3mica's Instituto Nacional de Estad\u00edsitica y Geograf\u00eda (INEGI), and the daily figures represent daily passenger trips ''averaged from the monthly and quarterly ridership figures''. All figures are from 2018 and the fourth quarter (Q4) of 2018, unless otherwise noted. \"Daily boardings per mile\" figures have been rounded to the nearest 5 or 10.\n\nThe question of which systems would count as \"light rail transit systems\" is debatable, so this table includes some systems (such as Toronto's) which are technically [[Tram|streetcars]] rather than \"true\" [[light rail]].\n\n==Systems==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n! \n!
