The book was immediately successful.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\n==Writing career==\n===Early writings===\nBy 1821, Carlyle abandoned the clergy as a career and focused on making a living as a writer. His first fiction, ''Cruthers and Jonson'', was one of several abortive attempts at writing a novel.{{vs|date=November 2019}} Following his work on a translation of [[Goethe]]'s ''Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship'',<ref name=Du/> he came to distrust the form of the realistic novel and so worked on developing a new form of fiction. In addition to his essays on [[German literature]], he branched out into wider-ranging commentary on modern culture in his influential essays ''Signs of the Times'' and ''Characteristics''.<ref name=\"daiches89\">D. Daiches (ed.), ''Companion to Literature 1'' (London, 1965), p. 89.</ref> In the latter, he laid down his abiding preference for the natural over the artificial: \"Thus, as we have an artificial Poetry, and prize only the natural; so likewise we have an artificial Morality, an artificial Wisdom, an artificial Society\".<ref>Quoted in M. H. Abrams, ''The Mirror and the Lamp'' (Oxford, 1971), p. 217.</ref>\n\nMoreover, at this time he penned articles appraising the life and works of various poets and men of letters, including [[Goethe]], [[Voltaire]] and [[Diderot]].\n\n===''Sartor Resartus''===\n{{main|Sartor Resartus|l1=''Sartor Resartus''}}\n[[File:Craigenputtock by George Moir.png|thumb|right|[[Craigenputtock|Craigenputtock House]], by George Moir, 1829]]\nHis first major work, ''[[Sartor Resartus]]'' ({{literal translation|''The Tailor Retailored''}}) was begun as a satirical article on \"the philosophy of clothes,\" and surprised him by growing into a full-length book.  He wrote it in 1831 at the house on his wife Jane's estate, [[Craigenputtock]],<ref name=Du/> and was intended to be a new kind of book: simultaneously factual and fictional, serious and satirical, speculative and historical. Ironically, it commented on its own formal structure while forcing the reader to confront the problem of where \"truth\" is to be found. ''Sartor Resartus'' was first published in instalments in ''Fraser's Magazine'' from 1833 to 1834.<ref name=Du/> The text presents itself as an unnamed editor's attempt to introduce the British public to Diogenes Teufelsdr\u00f6ckh, a German philosopher of clothes, who is, in fact, a fictional creation of Carlyle's. The Editor is struck with admiration, but for the most part is confounded by Teufelsdr\u00f6ckh's outlandish philosophy, of which the Editor translates choice selections. To try to make sense of Teufelsdr\u00f6ckh's philosophy, the Editor tries to piece together a biography, but with limited success. Underneath the German philosopher's seemingly ridiculous statements, there are mordant attacks on [[Utilitarianism]] and the commercialization of British society. The fragmentary biography of Teufelsdr\u00f6ckh that the Editor recovers from a chaotic mass of documents reveals the philosopher's spiritual journey.<ref name=\"ousby828\">I. Ousby (ed.), ''The Cambridge Guide to Literature in English'' (Cambridge, 1995), p. 828.</ref> He develops a contempt for the corrupt condition of modern life.

Its popularity developed over the next few years, and it was published as a single volume in Boston 1836, with a preface by [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]], influencing the development of [[New England Transcendentalism]]. The first British book edition followed in 1838.\n\n====The Everlasting No and Yea====\n[[File:Water-colour Sketch of Thomas Carlyle.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Watercolor sketch of Thomas Carlyle, age 46, by Samuel Laurence]]\n\"The Everlasting No\" is Carlyle's name for the spirit of unbelief in God, as embodied in the [[Mephistopheles]] of [[Goethe]], which is forever denying the reality of the divine in the thoughts, the character, and the life of humanity, and has a malicious pleasure in scoffing at everything high and noble as hollow and void.<ref>[[s:The Nuttall Encyclop\u00e6dia/E|\"Everlasting No, The.\"]] In: Reverend James Wood (ed.), ''The Nuttall Encyclop\u00e6dia'', 1907.</ref>\n\n\"The Everlasting Yea\" is Carlyle's name in the book for the spirit of faith in God in an attitude of clear, resolute, steady, and uncompromising antagonism to the \"Everlasting No\", and the principle that there is no such thing as faith in God except in such antagonism to the spirit opposed to God.<ref>[[s:The Nuttall Encyclop\u00e6dia/E|\"Everlasting Yea, The.\"]] In: Reverend James Wood (ed.), ''The Nuttall Encyclop\u00e6dia'', 1907.</ref>\n\nIn ''Sartor Resartus'', the narrator{{specify|reason=Teufelsdr\u00f6ckh or the Editor?|date=November 2019}} moves from the \"Everlasting No\" to the \"Everlasting Yea,\" but only through \"The Centre of Indifference,\" a position of agnosticism and detachment.  Only after reducing desires and certainty, aiming at a [[Buddha (general)|Buddha]]-like \"indifference\", can the narrator realize affirmation.  In some ways, this is similar to the contemporary philosopher [[S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard]]'s \"[[leap of faith]]\" in ''Concluding Unscientific Postscript''.\n\n====Worship of Silence and Sorrow====\nFollowing Goethe's description of Christianity as the \"Worship of Sorrow\", and \"our highest religion, for the Son of Man\", Carlyle interprets this as \"there is no noble crown, well worn or even ill worn, but is a crown of thorns\".<ref>[[s:The Nuttall Encyclop\u00e6dia/S|\"Sorrow, Worship of\"]] In: Reverend James Wood (ed.), ''The Nuttall Encyclop\u00e6dia'', 1907.</ref>\n\n\"The \"Worship of Silence\" is Carlyle's name for the sacred respect for restraint in speech till \"thought has silently matured itself,&nbsp;... to hold one's tongue till ''some'' meaning lie behind to set it wagging,\" a doctrine which many misunderstand, almost wilfully, it would seem; silence being to him the very womb out of which all great things are born.\"<ref>[[s:The Nuttall Encyclop\u00e6dia/S|\"Silence, Worship of\"]] In: Reverend James Wood (ed.), ''The Nuttall Encyclop\u00e6dia'', 1907.</ref>\n\n===''The French Revolution''===\n{{main|The French Revolution: A History|l1=''The French Revolution: A History''}}\n[[File:Carlyle manuscript burning Japan cph.3g10399.tif|thumb|Japanese print depicting Carlyle's horror at the burning of his manuscript of ''[[The French Revolution: A History]]'']]\nIn 1834, Carlyle and his wife left Craigenputtock for London and began to network in intellectual circles.<ref name=Du/> Within the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]], establishing his own reputation with the publication of his three-volume work ''[[The French Revolution: A History]]'' in 1837.<ref name=Du/> After the completed manuscript of the first volume was accidentally burned by a maid of the philosopher [[John Stuart Mill]], Carlyle wrote the second and third volumes before rewriting the first from scratch.<ref name=\"FF\" /><ref name=\"LL\">{{cite web|url=http://www.criminalbrief.com/?p=8890 |title=Thomas Carlyle|last=Lundin|first=Leigh| date=20 September 2009|work=Professional Works|publisher=Criminal Brief|accessdate=20 September 2009}}</ref>\n\nThe work had a passion surprising in historical writing of that period. In a politically charged Europe, filled with fears and hopes of revolution, Carlyle's account of the motivations and urges that inspired the events in France seemed powerfully relevant. Carlyle stressed the immediacy of action \u2013 often using the present tense \u2013 and incorporated different perspectives on the events he described.<ref>I. Ousby (ed.), ''The Cambridge Guide to Literature in English'' (Cambridge, 1995), p. 350.</ref>\n\nFor Carlyle, chaotic events demanded what he called \"[[hero]]es\" to take control over the competing forces erupting within society. While not denying the importance of economic and practical explanations for events, he saw these forces as \"spiritual\" \u2013 the hopes and aspirations of people that took the form of ideas, and were often ossified into ideologies (\"formulas\" or \"[[-ism|isms]]\", as he called them). In Carlyle's view, only dynamic individuals could master events and direct these spiritual energies effectively: as soon as ideological \"formulas\" replaced heroic human action, society became dehumanized.{{npsn|date=March 2018}} Like the opinions of many thinkers of the time, these ideas were influential on the development and rise of both [[socialism]] and [[fascism]].<ref>Cumming, Mark (2004).

His belief in the importance of heroic leadership found form in the book ''[[On Heroes, Hero-Worship, and The Heroic in History]]'', in which he was seen to compare a wide range of different types of heroes, including [[Odin]], [[Muhammad]], [[Oliver Cromwell]], [[Napoleon]], [[William Shakespeare]], [[Dante]], [[Samuel Johnson]], [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], [[Robert Burns]], [[John Knox]], and [[Martin Luther]].<ref>Delaura, David J.

However, for Carlyle, unlike Aristotle, the world was filled with contradictions with which the hero had to deal. All heroes will be flawed. Their heroism lay in their creative energy in the face of these difficulties, not in their moral perfection. To sneer at such a person for their failings is the philosophy of those who seek comfort in the conventional.{{npsn|date=November 2019}} Carlyle called this \"valetism\", from the expression \"no man is a hero to his [[valet]].\"<ref>Carlyle, Thomas (1869), ''On Heroes, Hero-Worship, & the Heroic in History'', London: Chapman and Hall, 301.</ref>\n\n===''Past and Present''===\n{{main|Past and Present (book)|l1=''Past and Present''}}\nIn 1843, he published his anti-democratic ''Past and Present'', with its doctrine of ordered work.<ref name=\"daiches90\">D.

Halevy, ''Victorian Years'' (London, 1961), p. 40.</ref> ''Past and Present''  combines [[medieval history]] with criticism of 19th-century British society. Carlyle wrote it in seven weeks as a respite from the harassing labor of writing ''Cromwell''. He was inspired by the recently published ''Chronicles of the Abbey of Saint Edmund's Bury'', which had been written by [[Jocelin of Brakelond]] at the close of the 12th century. This account of a medieval monastery had taken Carlyle's fancy, and he drew upon it in order to contrast the monks' reverence for work and heroism with the sham leadership of his own day.\n\n===Later work===\n[[File:Mrs Helen Allingham - Thomas Carlyle, 1795 - 1881. Historian and essayist - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|[[Helen Allingham]]'s 1879 painting of Carlyle]]\nAll these books were influential in their day, especially on writers such as [[Charles Dickens]] and [[John Ruskin]]. However, after the [[Revolutions of 1848]] and political agitations in the United Kingdom, Carlyle published a collection of essays entitled ''[[Latter-Day Pamphlets]]'', in 1850, in which he attacked democracy as an absurd social ideal, mocking the idea that objective truth could be discovered by weighing up the votes for it, while equally condemning hereditary aristocratic leadership as a \"deadening.\" The government should come from those ablest to lead, Carlyle asserted. Two of these essays, No. I: \"The Present Times\" and No. II: \"Model Prisons\" was reviewed by [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]] in April 1850.<ref>\"Reviews from the Neue Rheinische Zeitung Politish-\u00d6konomische Revue No. 4\" contained in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 10'' (International Publishers: New York, 1978) pp. 301\u2013310.</ref>   Marx and Engels state their approval of Carlyle's criticisms against hereditary aristocracy; however, they harshly criticize Carlyle's views as \"a thinly disguised acceptance of existing class rule\" and an unjust exoneration of [[statism]].<ref>\"Reviews from the Neue Rheinische Zeitung Politisch-\u00d6konomische Revue No. 4\" contained in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 10'', p. 306.</ref> [[Anthony Trollope]] for his part considered that in the Pamphlets \"the grain of sense is so smothered in a sack of the sheerest trash.... He has one idea \u2013 a hatred of spoken and acted falsehood; and on this, he harps through the whole eight pamphlets\".<ref>Quoted in M. Sadleir, ''Trollope'' (London, 1945), p. 158.</ref> A century later, [[Northrop Frye]] would similarly speak of the work as \"tantrum prose\" and \"rhetorical ectoplasm.\"<ref>N.

The ''Letters and Speeches of Oliver Cromwell'' (1845) presented a positive image of [[Oliver Cromwell|Cromwell]]: someone who attempted to weld order from the conflicting forces of reform in his own day. Carlyle sought to make Cromwell's words live in their own terms by quoting him directly and then commenting on the significance of these words in the troubled context of the time. Again this was intended to make the past \"present\" to his readers: \"he is epic, still living\".<ref>Carlyle, quoted in G. M. Trevelyan, ''An Autobiography'' (London, 1949), p. 175.</ref>\n\nHis essay \"[[Occasional Discourse on the Negro Question]]\" (1849) suggested that slavery should never have been abolished, or else replaced with [[serfdom]].{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} It had kept order, he argued, and forced work from people who would otherwise have been lazy and feckless: \"West Indian blacks are emancipated and, it appears, refuse to work\".<ref>Quoted in E. Halevy, ''Victorian Years'' (London, 1961), p. 257.</ref> This, and Carlyle's support for the repressive measures of Governor [[Edward Eyre]] in Jamaica during the [[Morant Bay rebellion]],<ref name=\"daiches90\"/> further alienated him from his old liberal allies. As Governor of the Colony, Eyre, fearful of an island-wide uprising, forcibly suppressed the rebellion and had many black peasants killed. Hundreds were flogged. He also authorized the execution of [[George William Gordon]], a mixed-race colonial assemblyman who was suspected of involvement in the rebellion.  These events created great controversy in Britain, resulting in demands for Eyre to be arrested and tried for murdering Gordon. [[John Stuart Mill]] organised the [[Jamaica Committee]], which demanded his prosecution and included some well-known British liberal intellectuals (such as [[John Bright]], [[Charles Darwin]], [[Frederic Harrison]], [[Thomas Hughes]], [[Thomas Henry Huxley]], and [[Herbert Spencer]]).\n\nCarlyle set up rival Governor Eyre Defence and Aid Committee for the defence, arguing that Eyre had acted decisively to restore order.<ref>Hall, Catherine (2002). ''Civilising Subjects: Metropole and Colony in the English Imagination, 1830\u20131867''. University of Chicago Press, p. 25.</ref> His supporters included [[John Ruskin]], [[Charles Kingsley]], [[Charles Dickens]],  [[Alfred, Lord Tennyson|Alfred Tennyson]] and [[John Tyndall]]. Eyre was twice charged with murder, but the cases never proceeded.\n\nSimilar hard-line views were expressed in ''Shooting Niagara, and After?'', written after the passing of the [[Reform Act 1867|Electoral Reform Act of 1867]] in which he \"reaffirmed his belief in wise leadership (and wise [[followership]]), his disbelief in democracy and his hatred of all workmanship \u2013 from brickmaking to diplomacy \u2013 that was not genuine.\"<ref>Trella, D.J. (1992). \"Carlyle's 'Shooting Niagara': The Writing and Revising of an Article and Pamphlet\", ''Victorian Periodicals Review'' '''25''' (1), pp. 30\u201334.</ref>\n\n====''Frederick the Great''====\n{{Main|History of Friedrich II of Prussia|l1=''History of Friedrich II of Prussia''}}\n[[File:Maurice.JPG|thumbnail|upright|Carlyle (left) depicted with [[Frederick Denison Maurice|Frederick Maurice]] in [[Ford Madox Brown]]'s painting ''[[Work (painting)|Work]]'' (1865)]]\nHis last major work was ''[[History of Friedrich II of Prussia]]'', an epic life of [[Frederick the Great]] (1858\u20131865). In this Carlyle tried to show how a heroic leader can forge a state, and help create a new moral culture for a nation. For Carlyle, Frederick epitomized the transition from the liberal [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] ideals of the eighteenth century to a new modern culture of spiritual dynamism embodied by Germany, its thought and its polity. The book is most famous for its vivid, arguably very biased,{{vs|date=November 2019}} portrayal of Frederick's battles, in which Carlyle communicated his vision of almost overwhelming chaos mastered by the leadership of genius.{{npsn|date=November 2019}}\n\nCarlyle struggled to write the book, calling it his \"Thirteen Years War\" with Frederick. Some of the nicknames he came up with for the work included \"the Nightmare,\" \"the Minotaur,\" and \"the Unutterable book\".<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.futilitycloset.com/2018/07/15/peace-and-quiet-4/|title=Peace and Quiet|last=Ross|first=Greg|date=15 July 2018|website=[[Futility Closet]]|access-date=16 July 2018}}</ref> In 1852, he made his first trip to Germany to gather material, visiting the scenes of Frederick's battles and noting their topography.  He made another trip to Germany to study battlefields in 1858. The work comprised six volumes; the first two volumes appeared in 1858, the third in 1862, the fourth in 1864 and the last two in 1865. [[Ralph Waldo Emerson|Emerson]] considered it \"Infinitely the wittiest book that was ever written.\" [[James Russell Lowell]] pointed out some faults, but wrote: \"The figures of most historians seem like dolls stuffed with bran, whose whole substance runs out through any hole that criticism may tear in them; but Carlyle's are so real in comparison, that, if you prick them, they bleed.\" The work was studied as a textbook in the military academies of Germany.<ref>{{Cite Americana|wstitle=Frederick the Great |year=1920}}</ref><ref>{{Cite Americana|wstitle=Carlyle, Thomas |year=1920}}</ref> [[David Daiches]], however, later concluded that \"since his 'idea' of Frederick is not really borne out by the evidence, his mythopoeic effort partially fails\".<ref name=\"daiches90\"/>\n\nThe effort involved in the writing of the book took its toll on Carlyle, who became increasingly depressed, and subject to various probably psychosomatic ailments. In 1853 he wrote a letter to his sister describing the construction of a small [[Penthouse apartment|penthouse]] room over his home in [[Chelsea, London|Chelsea]], intended as a [[Soundproofing|soundproof]] writer's room. Unfortunately, the skylight made it \"the noisiest room in the house\"<ref name=\":0\" />. The mixed reception to the book also contributed to Carlyle's decreased literary output.\n\n====Last works====\nLater writings were generally short essays, notably the unsuccessful ''The Early Kings of Norway'',<ref>I. Ousby (ed.), ''The Cambridge Guide to Literature in English'' (Cambridge, 1995), p. 154.</ref> a series on early-medieval Norwegian warlords.  Also ''An Essay on the Portraits of John Knox'' appeared in 1875, attempting to prove that the best-known portrait of [[John Knox]] did not depict the Scottish prelate. This was linked to Carlyle's long interest in historical portraiture, which had earlier fuelled his project to found a gallery of national portraits, fulfilled by the creation of the [[National Portrait Gallery, London]] and the [[Scottish National Portrait Gallery]].

In particular, he developed an antipathy to the Keeper of Printed Books, [[Anthony Panizzi]] (despite the fact that Panizzi had allowed him many privileges not granted to other readers), and criticised him, as the \"respectable Sub-Librarian\", in a footnote to an article published in the ''[[Westminster Review]]''.<ref>Wells (1991), pp. 26\u201331.</ref> Carlyle's eventual solution, with the support of a number of influential friends, was to call for the establishment of a private [[subscription library]] from which books could be borrowed.\n\n==Personal life==\n[[File:Portrait of Carlyle in his garden at Chelsea (4671347).jpg|thumb|upright|Portrait of Carlyle in his garden at Chelsea]]\n[[File:Jane Baillie Carlyle (n\u00e9e Welsh) by Samuel Laurence detail.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Portrait of Jane Welsh Carlyle by [[Samuel Laurence]], {{circa|lk=no|1852}}]]\nCarlyle had a number of would-be romances before he married [[Jane Welsh Carlyle|Jane Welsh]], important as a literary figure in her own right.

Invited by [[Nathan Rothschild, 1st Baron Rothschild|Baron Rothschild]] in 1848 to support a Bill in Parliament to allow [[Emancipation of the Jews in the United Kingdom|voting rights for Jews in the United Kingdom]], Carlyle declined to offer his support to what he named the \"Jew Bill\". In a correspondence with [[Richard Monckton Milnes, 1st Baron Houghton|Richard Monckton Milnes]] he insisted that Jews were hypocritical to want admission into the British Parliament, suggesting that a \"real Jew\" could only be a representative or citizen of \"his own wretched [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]]\", and in this context, declared that all Jews should be expelled to Palestine.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Cumming |first1=Mark |date=2004 |title=The Carlyle Encyclopedia |publisher=[[Fairleigh Dickinson University Press]]  |isbn= 978-1611471724 |pages=252 |quote=a Jew is bad but what is a Sham-Jew, a Quack-Jew?

Froude wrote of this painting: <blockquote>under Millais's hands the old Carlyle stood again upon the canvas as I had not seen him for thirty years. The inner secret of the features had been evidently caught. There was a likeness which no sculptor, no photographer, had yet equaled or approached. Afterward, I knew not how it seemed to fade away.</blockquote>]]\nThomas Carlyle is notable both for his continuation of older traditions of the [[Tory]] satirists of the 18th century in England and for forging a new tradition of [[Victorian era]] criticism of progress known as [[sage writing]].<ref>Holloway, John (1953). ''The Victorian Sage: Studies in Argument''. London: Macmillan; Landow, George (1986). ''Elegant Jeremiahs: The Sage from Carlyle to Mailer''. Ithaca, New York: Cornell University Press.</ref> ''Sartor Resartus'' can be seen both as an extension of the chaotic, sceptical satires of [[Jonathan Swift]] and [[Laurence Sterne]] and as an enunciation of a new point of view on values.\n\nCarlyle is also important for helping to introduce German Romantic literature to Britain. Although [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]] had also been a proponent of [[Schiller]], Carlyle's efforts on behalf of Schiller and Goethe would bear fruit.<ref name = \"fair\"/>\n\n[[File:Whistler James Arrangement in Gray and Black No2 1873.jpg|thumb|upright|''[[Arrangement in Grey and Black, No. 2: Portrait of Thomas Carlyle]]''.

Amsterdam: Editions Rodopi, p. 141.</ref> It has been argued that his critique of ideological formulas in ''The French Revolution'' provides a good account of the ways in which revolutionary cultures turn into repressive dogmatism.\n\nEssentially a [[Romanticism|Romantic]], Carlyle attempted to reconcile Romantic affirmations of feeling and freedom with respect for historical and political fact. Many believe that he was always more attracted to the idea of heroic struggle itself than to any specific goal for which the struggle was being made. However, Carlyle's belief in the continued use to humanity of the [[Great Man theory|Hero, or Great Man]], is stated succinctly at the end of his essay on [[Muhammad]] (in ''On Heroes, Hero-Worship & the Heroic in History''), in which he concludes that: \"the Great Man was always as lightning out of Heaven; the rest of men waited for him like fuel, and then they too would flame.\"<ref>Carlyle, Thomas (1840), ''On Heroes, Hero-worship and the Heroic in History'', London: Chapman and Hall, p. 90.</ref>\n\nA bust of Carlyle is in the Hall of Heroes of the [[National Wallace Monument]] in [[Stirling]].\n\n==Works==\n* (1829) ''Signs of the Times''.

Translations by A. Kretzschmar. Abandoned after 6 vols.\nAuthorised lifetime editions:\n* Uniform edition, [[Chapman and Hall]], 16 vols, 1857\u201358.\n* Library edition, Chapman and Hall, 34 vols (30 vols 1869\u201371, 3 additional vols added 1871 and one more 1875). The most lavish lifetime edition, it sold for 6 to 9 shillings per volume (or \u00a315 the set)\n* People's edition, Chapman and Hall, 39 vols (37 vols 1871\u201374, with 2 extra volumes added in 1874 and 1878). Carlyle insisted the price be kept to 2 shillings per volume.\n* Cabinet edition, Chapman and Hall, 37 vols in 18, 1874 (printed from the plates of the People's Edition)\nPosthumous editions:\n* Centennial edition, Chapman and Hall, 30 vol, 1896\u201399 (with reprints to at least 1907). Introductions by [[Henry Duff Traill]]. The text is based on the People's edition, and it is used by many scholars as the standard edition of Carlyle's works.\n* Norman and Charlotte Strouse edition (originally the California Carlyle edition), [[University of California Press]], 1993\u20132006. Only 4 volumes were issued: ''On Heroes'' (1993), ''Sartor Resartus'' (2000), ''Historical Essays'' (2003) and ''Past and Present'' (2006). Despite being incomplete, it is the only critical edition of (some of) Carlyle's works.\n\n==Definitions==\nCarlyle had quite a few unusual definitions at hand, which were collected by the ''[[Nuttall Encyclopedia]]''. Some include:\n\n;''Centre of Immensities'': An expression of Carlyle's to signify that wherever any one is, he is in touch with the whole universe of being, and is, if he knew it, as near the heart of it there as anywhere else he can be.\n;''Eleutheromania'': A mania or frantic zeal for freedom.\n;''Gigman'': Carlyle's name for a man who prides himself on, and pays all respect to, respectability. It is derived from a definition once given in a court of justice by a witness who, having described a person as respectable, was asked by the judge in the case what he meant by the word; \"one that keeps a [[Gig (carriage)|gig]],\" was the answer. Carlyle also refers to \"gigmanity\" at large.\n;''Hallowed Fire'': An expression of Carlyle's in definition of Christianity \"at its rise and spread\" as sacred, and kindling what was sacred and divine in man's soul, and burning up all that was not.\n;''Mights and Rights'': The Carlyle doctrine that Rights are nothing till they have realised and established themselves as Mights; they ''are'' rights first only then.\n;''Pig-Philosophy'': The name given by Carlyle in his ''[[Latter-Day Pamphlets]],'' in the one on Jesuitism, to the widespread philosophy of the time, which regarded the human being as a mere creature of appetite instead of a creature of God endowed with a soul, as having no nobler idea of well-being than the gratification of desire \u2013 that his only Heaven, and the reverse of it his Hell.\n;''Plugston of Undershot'': Carlyle's name for a \"[[captain of industry]]\" or member of the manufacturing class.\n;''Present Time'': Defined by Carlyle as \"the youngest born of Eternity, child and heir of all the past times, with their good and evil, and parent of all the future with new questions and significance,\" on the right or wrong understanding of which depend the issues of life or death to us all, the sphinx riddle given to all of us to rede as we would live and not die.\n;''Prinzenraub'' (the stealing of the princes): Name given to an attempt to satisfy a private grudge of his, on the part of [[Kunz von Kaufungen]] to carry off, on the night of 7 July 1455, two Saxon princes from the castle of [[Altenburg]], in which he was defeated by apprehension at the hands of a collier named Schmidt, through whom he was handed over to justice and beheaded. See Carlyle's account of this in his \"Miscellanies.\"\n;''Printed Paper'': Carlyle's satirical name for the literature of France prior to the Revolution.\n;''Progress of the Species Magazines'': Carlyle's name for the literature of the day which does nothing to help the progress in question, but keeps idly boasting of the fact, taking all the credit to itself, like French Poet [[Jean de La Fontaine]]'s fly on the axle of the careening chariot soliloquising, \"What a dust I raise!\"\n;''Sauerteig'': (i.e. leaven), an imaginary authority alive to the \"celestial infernal\" fermentation that goes on in the world, who has an eye specially to the evil elements at work, and to whose opinion Carlyle frequently appeals in his condemnatory verdict on sublunary things.\n;''The Conflux of Eternities'': Carlyle's expressive phrase for ''time'', as in every moment of it a centre in which all the forces to and from eternity meet and unite, so that by no past and no future can we be brought nearer to Eternity than where we at any moment of Time are; the Present Time, the youngest born of Eternity, being the child and heir of all the Past times with their good and evil, and the parent of all the Future. By the import of which (see Matt. xvi. 27), it is accordingly the first and most sacred duty of every successive age, and especially the leaders of it, to know and lay to heart as the only link by which Eternity lays hold of it, and it of Eternity.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Great man theory]]\n* [[Historiography of the French Revolution]]\n* [[Historiography of the United Kingdom]]\n* [[John Sterling (author)|John Sterling]]\n* {{lang|fr|[[Nouvelle histoire]]}}\n* [[Philosophy of history]]\n* [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]]\n* {{lang|de|[[\u00dcbermensch]]}}\n* [[Whig history]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n<!--READ ME!!

[[philosopher]], [[mathematician]], and teacher. In his book ''[[On Heroes, Hero-Worship, and The Heroic in History]]'' (1841), he argued that the actions of the \"[[Great man theory|Great Man]]\" play a key role in history, claiming that \"the history of the world is but the biography of great men\".<ref name=\"On Heroes\">{{cite book|last=Carlyle|first=Thomas|title=On Heroes, Hero-worship, & the Heroic in History |url=https://archive.org/details/onheroesherowor06carlgoog |quote=The history of the world is but the biography of great men.|year=1841 |page=[https://archive.org/details/onheroesherowor06carlgoog/page/n48 34] |place=New York |publisher=D.

The book was immediately successful.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\n==Writing career==\n===Early writings===\nBy 1821, Carlyle abandoned the clergy as a career and focused on making a living as a writer. His first fiction, ''Cruthers and Jonson'', was one of several abortive attempts at writing a novel.{{vs|date=November 2019}} Following his work on a translation of [[Goethe]]'s ''Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship'',<ref name=Du/> he came to distrust the form of the realistic novel and so worked on developing a new form of fiction. In addition to his essays on [[German literature]], he branched out into wider-ranging commentary on modern culture in his influential essays ''Signs of the Times'' and ''Characteristics''.<ref name=\"daiches89\">D. Daiches (ed.), ''Companion to Literature 1'' (London, 1965), p. 89.</ref> In the latter, he laid down his abiding preference for the natural over the artificial: \"Thus, as we have an artificial Poetry, and prize only the natural; so likewise we have an artificial Morality, an artificial Wisdom, an artificial Society\".<ref>Quoted in M.

Abrams, ''The Mirror and the Lamp'' (Oxford, 1971), p. 217.</ref>\n\nMoreover, at this time he penned articles appraising the life and works of various poets and men of letters, including [[Goethe]], [[Voltaire]] and [[Diderot]].\n\n===''Sartor Resartus''===\n{{main|Sartor Resartus|l1=''Sartor Resartus''}}\n[[File:Craigenputtock by George Moir.png|thumb|right|[[Craigenputtock|Craigenputtock House]], by George Moir, 1829]]\nHis first major work, ''[[Sartor Resartus]]'' ({{literal translation|''The Tailor Retailored''}}) was begun as a satirical article on \"the philosophy of clothes,\" and surprised him by growing into a full-length book.  He wrote it in 1831 at the house on his wife Jane's estate, [[Craigenputtock]],<ref name=Du/> and was intended to be a new kind of book: simultaneously factual and fictional, serious and satirical, speculative and historical. Ironically, it commented on its own formal structure while forcing the reader to confront the problem of where \"truth\" is to be found. ''Sartor Resartus'' was first published in instalments in ''Fraser's Magazine'' from 1833 to 1834.<ref name=Du/> The text presents itself as an unnamed editor's attempt to introduce the British public to Diogenes Teufelsdr\u00f6ckh, a German philosopher of clothes, who is, in fact, a fictional creation of Carlyle's. The Editor is struck with admiration, but for the most part is confounded by Teufelsdr\u00f6ckh's outlandish philosophy, of which the Editor translates choice selections. To try to make sense of Teufelsdr\u00f6ckh's philosophy, the Editor tries to piece together a biography, but with limited success. Underneath the German philosopher's seemingly ridiculous statements, there are mordant attacks on [[Utilitarianism]] and the commercialization of British society. The fragmentary biography of Teufelsdr\u00f6ckh that the Editor recovers from a chaotic mass of documents reveals the philosopher's spiritual journey.<ref name=\"ousby828\">I.

Its popularity developed over the next few years, and it was published as a single volume in Boston 1836, with a preface by [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]], influencing the development of [[New England Transcendentalism]]. The first British book edition followed in 1838.\n\n====The Everlasting No and Yea====\n[[File:Water-colour Sketch of Thomas Carlyle.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Watercolor sketch of Thomas Carlyle, age 46, by Samuel Laurence]]\n\"The Everlasting No\" is Carlyle's name for the spirit of unbelief in God, as embodied in the [[Mephistopheles]] of [[Goethe]], which is forever denying the reality of the divine in the thoughts, the character, and the life of humanity, and has a malicious pleasure in scoffing at everything high and noble as hollow and void.<ref>[[s:The Nuttall Encyclop\u00e6dia/E|\"Everlasting No, The.\"]] In: Reverend James Wood (ed.), ''The Nuttall Encyclop\u00e6dia'', 1907.</ref>\n\n\"The Everlasting Yea\" is Carlyle's name in the book for the spirit of faith in God in an attitude of clear, resolute, steady, and uncompromising antagonism to the \"Everlasting No\", and the principle that there is no such thing as faith in God except in such antagonism to the spirit opposed to God.<ref>[[s:The Nuttall Encyclop\u00e6dia/E|\"Everlasting Yea, The.\"]] In: Reverend James Wood (ed.), ''The Nuttall Encyclop\u00e6dia'', 1907.</ref>\n\nIn ''Sartor Resartus'', the narrator{{specify|reason=Teufelsdr\u00f6ckh or the Editor?|date=November 2019}} moves from the \"Everlasting No\" to the \"Everlasting Yea,\" but only through \"The Centre of Indifference,\" a position of agnosticism and detachment.  Only after reducing desires and certainty, aiming at a [[Buddha (general)|Buddha]]-like \"indifference\", can the narrator realize affirmation.  In some ways, this is similar to the contemporary philosopher [[S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard]]'s \"[[leap of faith]]\" in ''Concluding Unscientific Postscript''.\n\n====Worship of Silence and Sorrow====\nFollowing Goethe's description of Christianity as the \"Worship of Sorrow\", and \"our highest religion, for the Son of Man\", Carlyle interprets this as \"there is no noble crown, well worn or even ill worn, but is a crown of thorns\".<ref>[[s:The Nuttall Encyclop\u00e6dia/S|\"Sorrow, Worship of\"]] In: Reverend James Wood (ed.), ''The Nuttall Encyclop\u00e6dia'', 1907.</ref>\n\n\"The \"Worship of Silence\" is Carlyle's name for the sacred respect for restraint in speech till \"thought has silently matured itself,&nbsp;... to hold one's tongue till ''some'' meaning lie behind to set it wagging,\" a doctrine which many misunderstand, almost wilfully, it would seem; silence being to him the very womb out of which all great things are born.\"<ref>[[s:The Nuttall Encyclop\u00e6dia/S|\"Silence, Worship of\"]] In: Reverend James Wood (ed.), ''The Nuttall Encyclop\u00e6dia'', 1907.</ref>\n\n===''The French Revolution''===\n{{main|The French Revolution: A History|l1=''The French Revolution: A History''}}\n[[File:Carlyle manuscript burning Japan cph.3g10399.tif|thumb|Japanese print depicting Carlyle's horror at the burning of his manuscript of ''[[The French Revolution: A History]]'']]\nIn 1834, Carlyle and his wife left Craigenputtock for London and began to network in intellectual circles.<ref name=Du/> Within the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]], establishing his own reputation with the publication of his three-volume work ''[[The French Revolution: A History]]'' in 1837.<ref name=Du/> After the completed manuscript of the first volume was accidentally burned by a maid of the philosopher [[John Stuart Mill]], Carlyle wrote the second and third volumes before rewriting the first from scratch.<ref name=\"FF\" /><ref name=\"LL\">{{cite web|url=http://www.criminalbrief.com/?p=8890 |title=Thomas Carlyle|last=Lundin|first=Leigh| date=20 September 2009|work=Professional Works|publisher=Criminal Brief|accessdate=20 September 2009}}</ref>\n\nThe work had a passion surprising in historical writing of that period. In a politically charged Europe, filled with fears and hopes of revolution, Carlyle's account of the motivations and urges that inspired the events in France seemed powerfully relevant. Carlyle stressed the immediacy of action \u2013 often using the present tense \u2013 and incorporated different perspectives on the events he described.<ref>I. Ousby (ed.), ''The Cambridge Guide to Literature in English'' (Cambridge, 1995), p. 350.</ref>\n\nFor Carlyle, chaotic events demanded what he called \"[[hero]]es\" to take control over the competing forces erupting within society. While not denying the importance of economic and practical explanations for events, he saw these forces as \"spiritual\" \u2013 the hopes and aspirations of people that took the form of ideas, and were often ossified into ideologies (\"formulas\" or \"[[-ism|isms]]\", as he called them). In Carlyle's view, only dynamic individuals could master events and direct these spiritual energies effectively: as soon as ideological \"formulas\" replaced heroic human action, society became dehumanized.{{npsn|date=March 2018}} Like the opinions of many thinkers of the time, these ideas were influential on the development and rise of both [[socialism]] and [[fascism]].<ref>Cumming, Mark (2004).

His belief in the importance of heroic leadership found form in the book ''[[On Heroes, Hero-Worship, and The Heroic in History]]'', in which he was seen to compare a wide range of different types of heroes, including [[Odin]], [[Muhammad]], [[Oliver Cromwell]], [[Napoleon]], [[William Shakespeare]], [[Dante]], [[Samuel Johnson]], [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], [[Robert Burns]], [[John Knox]], and [[Martin Luther]].<ref>Delaura, David J.

However, for Carlyle, unlike Aristotle, the world was filled with contradictions with which the hero had to deal. All heroes will be flawed. Their heroism lay in their creative energy in the face of these difficulties, not in their moral perfection. To sneer at such a person for their failings is the philosophy of those who seek comfort in the conventional.{{npsn|date=November 2019}} Carlyle called this \"valetism\", from the expression \"no man is a hero to his [[valet]].\"<ref>Carlyle, Thomas (1869), ''On Heroes, Hero-Worship, & the Heroic in History'', London: Chapman and Hall, 301.</ref>\n\n===''Past and Present''===\n{{main|Past and Present (book)|l1=''Past and Present''}}\nIn 1843, he published his anti-democratic ''Past and Present'', with its doctrine of ordered work.<ref name=\"daiches90\">D. Daiches ed., ''Companion to Literature 1'' (London, 1965), p. 90.</ref> In it, he influentially called attention to what he termed the \"[[Condition of England question|Condition of England]]\" saying \"England is full of wealth...supply for human want in every kind; yet England is dying of inanition\".<ref>Quoted in E. Halevy, ''Victorian Years'' (London, 1961), p. 40.</ref> ''Past and Present''  combines [[medieval history]] with criticism of 19th-century British society. Carlyle wrote it in seven weeks as a respite from the harassing labor of writing ''Cromwell''. He was inspired by the recently published ''Chronicles of the Abbey of Saint Edmund's Bury'', which had been written by [[Jocelin of Brakelond]] at the close of the 12th century. This account of a medieval monastery had taken Carlyle's fancy, and he drew upon it in order to contrast the monks' reverence for work and heroism with the sham leadership of his own day.\n\n===Later work===\n[[File:Mrs Helen Allingham - Thomas Carlyle, 1795 - 1881. Historian and essayist - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|[[Helen Allingham]]'s 1879 painting of Carlyle]]\nAll these books were influential in their day, especially on writers such as [[Charles Dickens]] and [[John Ruskin]]. However, after the [[Revolutions of 1848]] and political agitations in the United Kingdom, Carlyle published a collection of essays entitled ''[[Latter-Day Pamphlets]]'', in 1850, in which he attacked democracy as an absurd social ideal, mocking the idea that objective truth could be discovered by weighing up the votes for it, while equally condemning hereditary aristocratic leadership as a \"deadening.\" The government should come from those ablest to lead, Carlyle asserted. Two of these essays, No. I: \"The Present Times\" and No. II: \"Model Prisons\" was reviewed by [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]] in April 1850.<ref>\"Reviews from the Neue Rheinische Zeitung Politish-\u00d6konomische Revue No. 4\" contained in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 10'' (International Publishers: New York, 1978) pp. 301\u2013310.</ref>   Marx and Engels state their approval of Carlyle's criticisms against hereditary aristocracy; however, they harshly criticize Carlyle's views as \"a thinly disguised acceptance of existing class rule\" and an unjust exoneration of [[statism]].<ref>\"Reviews from the Neue Rheinische Zeitung Politisch-\u00d6konomische Revue No. 4\" contained in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 10'', p. 306.</ref> [[Anthony Trollope]] for his part considered that in the Pamphlets \"the grain of sense is so smothered in a sack of the sheerest trash.... He has one idea \u2013 a hatred of spoken and acted falsehood; and on this, he harps through the whole eight pamphlets\".<ref>Quoted in M. Sadleir, ''Trollope'' (London, 1945), p. 158.</ref> A century later, [[Northrop Frye]] would similarly speak of the work as \"tantrum prose\" and \"rhetorical ectoplasm.\"<ref>N.

The ''Letters and Speeches of Oliver Cromwell'' (1845) presented a positive image of [[Oliver Cromwell|Cromwell]]: someone who attempted to weld order from the conflicting forces of reform in his own day. Carlyle sought to make Cromwell's words live in their own terms by quoting him directly and then commenting on the significance of these words in the troubled context of the time. Again this was intended to make the past \"present\" to his readers: \"he is epic, still living\".<ref>Carlyle, quoted in G. M. Trevelyan, ''An Autobiography'' (London, 1949), p. 175.</ref>\n\nHis essay \"[[Occasional Discourse on the Negro Question]]\" (1849) suggested that slavery should never have been abolished, or else replaced with [[serfdom]].{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} It had kept order, he argued, and forced work from people who would otherwise have been lazy and feckless: \"West Indian blacks are emancipated and, it appears, refuse to work\".<ref>Quoted in E. Halevy, ''Victorian Years'' (London, 1961), p. 257.</ref> This, and Carlyle's support for the repressive measures of Governor [[Edward Eyre]] in Jamaica during the [[Morant Bay rebellion]],<ref name=\"daiches90\"/> further alienated him from his old liberal allies. As Governor of the Colony, Eyre, fearful of an island-wide uprising, forcibly suppressed the rebellion and had many black peasants killed. Hundreds were flogged. He also authorized the execution of [[George William Gordon]], a mixed-race colonial assemblyman who was suspected of involvement in the rebellion.  These events created great controversy in Britain, resulting in demands for Eyre to be arrested and tried for murdering Gordon. [[John Stuart Mill]] organised the [[Jamaica Committee]], which demanded his prosecution and included some well-known British liberal intellectuals (such as [[John Bright]], [[Charles Darwin]], [[Frederic Harrison]], [[Thomas Hughes]], [[Thomas Henry Huxley]], and [[Herbert Spencer]]).\n\nCarlyle set up rival Governor Eyre Defence and Aid Committee for the defence, arguing that Eyre had acted decisively to restore order.<ref>Hall, Catherine (2002). ''Civilising Subjects: Metropole and Colony in the English Imagination, 1830\u20131867''. University of Chicago Press, p. 25.</ref> His supporters included [[John Ruskin]], [[Charles Kingsley]], [[Charles Dickens]],  [[Alfred, Lord Tennyson|Alfred Tennyson]] and [[John Tyndall]]. Eyre was twice charged with murder, but the cases never proceeded.\n\nSimilar hard-line views were expressed in ''Shooting Niagara, and After?'', written after the passing of the [[Reform Act 1867|Electoral Reform Act of 1867]] in which he \"reaffirmed his belief in wise leadership (and wise [[followership]]), his disbelief in democracy and his hatred of all workmanship \u2013 from brickmaking to diplomacy \u2013 that was not genuine.\"<ref>Trella, D.J.

In this Carlyle tried to show how a heroic leader can forge a state, and help create a new moral culture for a nation. For Carlyle, Frederick epitomized the transition from the liberal [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] ideals of the eighteenth century to a new modern culture of spiritual dynamism embodied by Germany, its thought and its polity. The book is most famous for its vivid, arguably very biased,{{vs|date=November 2019}} portrayal of Frederick's battles, in which Carlyle communicated his vision of almost overwhelming chaos mastered by the leadership of genius.{{npsn|date=November 2019}}\n\nCarlyle struggled to write the book, calling it his \"Thirteen Years War\" with Frederick. Some of the nicknames he came up with for the work included \"the Nightmare,\" \"the Minotaur,\" and \"the Unutterable book\".<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.futilitycloset.com/2018/07/15/peace-and-quiet-4/|title=Peace and Quiet|last=Ross|first=Greg|date=15 July 2018|website=[[Futility Closet]]|access-date=16 July 2018}}</ref> In 1852, he made his first trip to Germany to gather material, visiting the scenes of Frederick's battles and noting their topography.  He made another trip to Germany to study battlefields in 1858. The work comprised six volumes; the first two volumes appeared in 1858, the third in 1862, the fourth in 1864 and the last two in 1865. [[Ralph Waldo Emerson|Emerson]] considered it \"Infinitely the wittiest book that was ever written.\" [[James Russell Lowell]] pointed out some faults, but wrote: \"The figures of most historians seem like dolls stuffed with bran, whose whole substance runs out through any hole that criticism may tear in them; but Carlyle's are so real in comparison, that, if you prick them, they bleed.\" The work was studied as a textbook in the military academies of Germany.<ref>{{Cite Americana|wstitle=Frederick the Great |year=1920}}</ref><ref>{{Cite Americana|wstitle=Carlyle, Thomas |year=1920}}</ref> [[David Daiches]], however, later concluded that \"since his 'idea' of Frederick is not really borne out by the evidence, his mythopoeic effort partially fails\".<ref name=\"daiches90\"/>\n\nThe effort involved in the writing of the book took its toll on Carlyle, who became increasingly depressed, and subject to various probably psychosomatic ailments. In 1853 he wrote a letter to his sister describing the construction of a small [[Penthouse apartment|penthouse]] room over his home in [[Chelsea, London|Chelsea]], intended as a [[Soundproofing|soundproof]] writer's room. Unfortunately, the skylight made it \"the noisiest room in the house\"<ref name=\":0\" />. The mixed reception to the book also contributed to Carlyle's decreased literary output.\n\n====Last works====\nLater writings were generally short essays, notably the unsuccessful ''The Early Kings of Norway'',<ref>I. Ousby (ed.), ''The Cambridge Guide to Literature in English'' (Cambridge, 1995), p. 154.</ref> a series on early-medieval Norwegian warlords.  Also ''An Essay on the Portraits of John Knox'' appeared in 1875, attempting to prove that the best-known portrait of [[John Knox]] did not depict the Scottish prelate. This was linked to Carlyle's long interest in historical portraiture, which had earlier fuelled his project to found a gallery of national portraits, fulfilled by the creation of the [[National Portrait Gallery, London]] and the [[Scottish National Portrait Gallery]]. He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1878.<ref name=AAAS>{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780\u20132010: Chapter C|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterC.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|accessdate=23 September 2016}}</ref>\n\n==London Library==\nCarlyle was the chief instigator in the foundation of the [[London Library]] in 1841.<ref>{{cite book |editor-last=Grindea |editor-first=Miron |editor-link=Miron Grindea |year=1978 |title=The London Library |place=Ipswich |pages=[https://archive.org/details/londonlibrary0000unse/page/9 9\u201313] |publisher=Boydell Press/Adam Books |isbn=0-85115-098-5 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/londonlibrary0000unse/page/9 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Wells |first=John |authorlink=John Wells (satirist) |year=1991 |title=Rude Words: a discursive history of the London Library |place=London |publisher=Macmillan |pages=12\u201356 |isbn=978-0333475195 }}</ref> He had become frustrated by the facilities available at the [[British Library|British Museum Library]], where he was often unable to find a seat (obliging him to perch on ladders), where he complained that the enforced close confinement with his fellow readers gave him a \"museum headache\", where the books were unavailable for loan, and where he found the library's collections of pamphlets and other material relating to the French Revolution and English Civil Wars inadequately catalogued. In particular, he developed an antipathy to the Keeper of Printed Books, [[Anthony Panizzi]] (despite the fact that Panizzi had allowed him many privileges not granted to other readers), and criticised him, as the \"respectable Sub-Librarian\", in a footnote to an article published in the ''[[Westminster Review]]''.<ref>Wells (1991), pp. 26\u201331.</ref> Carlyle's eventual solution, with the support of a number of influential friends, was to call for the establishment of a private [[subscription library]] from which books could be borrowed.\n\n==Personal life==\n[[File:Portrait of Carlyle in his garden at Chelsea (4671347).jpg|thumb|upright|Portrait of Carlyle in his garden at Chelsea]]\n[[File:Jane Baillie Carlyle (n\u00e9e Welsh) by Samuel Laurence detail.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Portrait of Jane Welsh Carlyle by [[Samuel Laurence]], {{circa|lk=no|1852}}]]\nCarlyle had a number of would-be romances before he married [[Jane Welsh Carlyle|Jane Welsh]], important as a literary figure in her own right. The most notable were with Margaret Gordon, a pupil of his friend [[Edward Irving]]. Even after he met Jane, he became enamoured of [[Kitty Kirkpatrick]], the daughter of a British officer and an Indian princess. [[William Dalrymple (historian)|William Dalrymple]], author of ''[[White Mughals]]'', suggests that feelings were mutual, but social circumstances made the marriage impossible, as Carlyle was then poor. Both Margaret and Kitty have been suggested as the original of \"[[Sartor Resartus#Characters|Blumine]]\", Teufelsdr\u00f6ckh's beloved, in ''[[Sartor Resartus]]''.<ref>Heffer, Simon (1995). ''Moral Desperado \u2013 A Life of Thomas Carlyle''. London: Weidenfeld & Nicolson, p. 48</ref>\n\nThomas also had a friendship with the writer [[Geraldine Jewsbury]] starting in 1840. During that year Jewsbury was going through a depressive state and also experiencing religious doubt. She wrote to Carlyle for guidance and also thanked him for his well-written essays. Eventually, Carlyle invited Jewsbury out to Cheyne Row, where Carlyle and Jane resided. Jewsbury and Jane from then on had a close friendship and Carlyle also helped Jewsbury get on to the English literary scene.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Howe|first1=Susanne|title=Geraldine Jewsbury, Her Life and Errors|date=1935|publisher=George Allen & Unwin|location=London}}</ref>\n\n===Marriage===\nCarlyle married Jane Welsh in 1826.<ref>Collis, John Stewart (1971). ''The Carlyles: A Biography of Thomas and Jane Carlyle''. London: Sidgwick & Jackson.</ref> He met Welsh through his friend and her tutor [[Edward Irving]], with whom she came to have a mutual romantic (although not intimate) attraction.

Over 9000 letters between Carlyle and his wife have been published showing the couple had an affection for each other marred by frequent and angry quarrels.<ref name=\"WA\" />\n\n{{quote|It was very good of God to let Carlyle and Mrs Carlyle marry one another, and so make only two people miserable and not four.|[[Samuel Butler (novelist)|Samuel Butler]]<ref>Butler, Samuel (1935).

Carlyle's biographer [[James Anthony Froude]] published (posthumously) his opinion that the marriage remained unconsummated due to impotence.<ref name=Froude>{{cite book|last=Froude|first=James|title=''My Relations with Carlyle''|year=1903|publisher=Charles Scribner's Sons|location=New York|url=https://archive.org/stream/myrelationswith00stepgoog#page/n8/mode/2up}} On pages 21\u201324, Froude insinuates that Carlyle was impotent (p. 21): \"She [Mrs. Carlyle] had longed for children, and children were denied to her. This had been at the bottom of all the quarrels and all the unhappiness\"; (p. 22): \"Intellectual and spiritual affection being all which he had to give [his wife]\"; (p. 23): \"Carlyle did not know when he married what his constitution was. The morning after his wedding-day he tore to pieces the flower-garden at the Comeley Bank in a fit of ungovernable fury.\"</ref> Frank Harris also suspected Carlyle of impotence. <ref>Harris, Frank. 'My Life and Loves' (London, Corgi 1973 p232 -243. ed. John F. Gallagher) claims that Carlyle had confessed his impotence to him personally, and records an account by Mrs Carlyle's doctor, who had examined and found her to be a virgin after 25 years of marriage. Harris's information is doubted by several scholars, the editor John Gallagher noted in a footnote.</ref>\n\nAlthough she had been an invalid for some time, his wife's sudden death in 1866 was unexpected and it greatly distressed Carlyle who was moved to write his highly self-critical \"Reminiscences of Jane Welsh Carlyle\", published posthumously.<ref name = Cumming2004>{{cite book|author=Mark Cumming|title=The Carlyle Encyclopedia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8Nvdx-4-CzoC&pg=PA83|accessdate=19 March 2013|year=2004|publisher=Fairleigh Dickinson Univ Press|isbn=978-0-8386-3792-0|pages=83\u2013}}</ref>\n\n===Later life===\nCarlyle was named Lord Rector of Edinburgh University. Three weeks after his inaugural address there, Jane died, and he partly retired from active society. His last years were spent at 24 Cheyne Row (then numbered 5), Chelsea, London SW3 (which is now a [[National Trust]] property<ref name=\"NT website\">[http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/main/w-vh/w-visits/w-findaplace/w-carlyleshouse/ Carlyle's House.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081015103425/http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/main/w-vh/w-visits/w-findaplace/w-carlyleshouse/ |date=15 October 2008 }},</ref> commemorating his life and works) but he hankered after a return to [[Craigenputtock]].\n\n===Death===\n[[File:Picture of Carlyle's Grave.jpg|thumb|Carlyle's Grave at [[Ecclefechan]]]]\nUpon Carlyle's death on 5 February 1881, it is a measure of his standing that interment in [[Westminster Abbey]] was offered; this was rejected by his executors due to Carlyle's expressed wish to be buried beside his parents in [[Ecclefechan]].<ref name=\"Cumming2004\" /> His final words were, \"So, this is death. Well!\"<ref>Conrad, Barnaby (1961). ''Famous Last Words''. London: Alvin Redman, p. 21.</ref>\n\n===Biography===\nCarlyle would have preferred that no biography of him was written, but when he heard that his wishes would not be respected and several people were waiting for him to die before they published, he relented and supplied his friend [[James Anthony Froude]] with many of his and his wife's papers. Carlyle's essay about his wife was included in ''Reminiscences, ''published shortly after his death by Froude, who also published the ''Letters and Memorials of Jane Welsh Carlyle'' annotated by Carlyle himself. Froude's ''Life of Carlyle'' was published over 1882\u201384. The frankness of this book was unheard of by the usually respectful standards of 19th-century biographies of the period.<ref>Dunn, Waldo Hilary (1930). ''Froude & Carlyle, a Study of the Froude-Carlyle Controversy''. London, Longmans, Green and Co.</ref> Froude's work was attacked by Carlyle's family, especially his nephew, Alexander Carlyle<ref>Carlyle, Alexander & Sir James Crichton-Browne (1903).

However, the biography in question was consistent with Carlyle's own conviction that the flaws of heroes should be openly discussed, without diminishing their achievements. Froude, who had been designated by Carlyle himself as his biographer-to-be, was acutely aware of this belief. Froude's defence of his decision, ''My Relations With Carlyle'', was published posthumously in 1903, including a reprint of Carlyle's 1873 will, in which Carlyle equivocated: \"Express biography of me I had really rather that there should be none.\" Nevertheless, Carlyle in the will simultaneously and completely deferred to Froude's judgment on the matter, whose \"decision is to be taken as mine.\"<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/myrelationswith00stepgoog#page/n82/mode/2up \"Will and Codicil of Thomas Carlyle, Esq.\"], in ''My Relations with Carlyle'', New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, p. 73.</ref>\n\n==Views==\n===Anglo-Saxonism===\nDescribed as one of the \"most adamant protagonists\" of [[Anglo-Saxonism]],<ref>{{cite book |last1=Pieterse |first1=Jan P.

In a correspondence with [[Richard Monckton Milnes, 1st Baron Houghton|Richard Monckton Milnes]] he insisted that Jews were hypocritical to want admission into the British Parliament, suggesting that a \"real Jew\" could only be a representative or citizen of \"his own wretched [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]]\", and in this context, declared that all Jews should be expelled to Palestine.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Cumming |first1=Mark |date=2004 |title=The Carlyle Encyclopedia |publisher=[[Fairleigh Dickinson University Press]]  |isbn= 978-1611471724 |pages=252 |quote=a Jew is bad but what is a Sham-Jew, a Quack-Jew?

Froude wrote of this painting: <blockquote>under Millais's hands the old Carlyle stood again upon the canvas as I had not seen him for thirty years.

Afterward, I knew not how it seemed to fade away.</blockquote>]]\nThomas Carlyle is notable both for his continuation of older traditions of the [[Tory]] satirists of the 18th century in England and for forging a new tradition of [[Victorian era]] criticism of progress known as [[sage writing]].<ref>Holloway, John (1953).

Many believe that he was always more attracted to the idea of heroic struggle itself than to any specific goal for which the struggle was being made. However, Carlyle's belief in the continued use to humanity of the [[Great Man theory|Hero, or Great Man]], is stated succinctly at the end of his essay on [[Muhammad]] (in ''On Heroes, Hero-Worship & the Heroic in History''), in which he concludes that: \"the Great Man was always as lightning out of Heaven; the rest of men waited for him like fuel, and then they too would flame.\"<ref>Carlyle, Thomas (1840), ''On Heroes, Hero-worship and the Heroic in History'', London: Chapman and Hall, p. 90.</ref>\n\nA bust of Carlyle is in the Hall of Heroes of the [[National Wallace Monument]] in [[Stirling]].\n\n==Works==\n* (1829) ''Signs of the Times''.

It is derived from a definition once given in a court of justice by a witness who, having described a person as respectable, was asked by the judge in the case what he meant by the word; \"one that keeps a [[Gig (carriage)|gig]],\" was the answer. Carlyle also refers to \"gigmanity\" at large.\n;''Hallowed Fire'': An expression of Carlyle's in definition of Christianity \"at its rise and spread\" as sacred, and kindling what was sacred and divine in man's soul, and burning up all that was not.\n;''Mights and Rights'': The Carlyle doctrine that Rights are nothing till they have realised and established themselves as Mights; they ''are'' rights first only then.\n;''Pig-Philosophy'': The name given by Carlyle in his ''[[Latter-Day Pamphlets]],'' in the one on Jesuitism, to the widespread philosophy of the time, which regarded the human being as a mere creature of appetite instead of a creature of God endowed with a soul, as having no nobler idea of well-being than the gratification of desire \u2013 that his only Heaven, and the reverse of it his Hell.\n;''Plugston of Undershot'': Carlyle's name for a \"[[captain of industry]]\" or member of the manufacturing class.\n;''Present Time'': Defined by Carlyle as \"the youngest born of Eternity, child and heir of all the past times, with their good and evil, and parent of all the future with new questions and significance,\" on the right or wrong understanding of which depend the issues of life or death to us all, the sphinx riddle given to all of us to rede as we would live and not die.\n;''Prinzenraub'' (the stealing of the princes): Name given to an attempt to satisfy a private grudge of his, on the part of [[Kunz von Kaufungen]] to carry off, on the night of 7 July 1455, two Saxon princes from the castle of [[Altenburg]], in which he was defeated by apprehension at the hands of a collier named Schmidt, through whom he was handed over to justice and beheaded. See Carlyle's account of this in his \"Miscellanies.\"\n;''Printed Paper'': Carlyle's satirical name for the literature of France prior to the Revolution.\n;''Progress of the Species Magazines'': Carlyle's name for the literature of the day which does nothing to help the progress in question, but keeps idly boasting of the fact, taking all the credit to itself, like French Poet [[Jean de La Fontaine]]'s fly on the axle of the careening chariot soliloquising, \"What a dust I raise!\"\n;''Sauerteig'': (i.e. leaven), an imaginary authority alive to the \"celestial infernal\" fermentation that goes on in the world, who has an eye specially to the evil elements at work, and to whose opinion Carlyle frequently appeals in his condemnatory verdict on sublunary things.\n;''The Conflux of Eternities'': Carlyle's expressive phrase for ''time'', as in every moment of it a centre in which all the forces to and from eternity meet and unite, so that by no past and no future can we be brought nearer to Eternity than where we at any moment of Time are; the Present Time, the youngest born of Eternity, being the child and heir of all the Past times with their good and evil, and the parent of all the Future. By the import of which (see Matt. xvi. 27), it is accordingly the first and most sacred duty of every successive age, and especially the leaders of it, to know and lay to heart as the only link by which Eternity lays hold of it, and it of Eternity.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Great man theory]]\n* [[Historiography of the French Revolution]]\n* [[Historiography of the United Kingdom]]\n* [[John Sterling (author)|John Sterling]]\n* {{lang|fr|[[Nouvelle histoire]]}}\n* [[Philosophy of history]]\n* [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]]\n* {{lang|de|[[\u00dcbermensch]]}}\n* [[Whig history]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n<!--READ ME!!

Gowan]], a politician who founded a local branch of the [[Orange Order of Canada|Orange Order]] in 1830, and two uncles, one a Supreme Court justice and the other a senator. Her brother also became a lawyer and another member of the Supreme Court. Another uncle was [[Thomas Roberts Ferguson]], an MP,<ref>{{cite book|editor1-last=Charters|editor1-first=C. V.|title=A history of Peel County: to mark its centenary|date=1967|publisher=The County of Peel|location=Brampton ON|page=150}}</ref> and she was related to [[James Robert Gowan]], who was a lawyer, judge, and senator.\n\nMurphy benefited from parents who supported their daughter's receiving a formal academic education. She attended [[Bishop Strachan School]], an exclusive Anglican private school for girls in Toronto where, through a friend, she met her future husband Arthur Murphy, who was 11 years her senior.\n\nIn 1887, they married, and subsequently had four daughters: Madeleine, Evelyn, Doris and Kathleen. Doris died. After Doris' death, the family decided to try a new setting and moved west to [[Swan River, Manitoba]], in 1903 and then to [[Edmonton|Edmonton, Alberta]], in 1907.\n\n== Career ==\n\n=== Dower Act ===\n[[File:emilymurphy.jpg|left|thumb|Statue of Emily Murphy in the monument to [[The Famous Five (Canada)|The Famous Five]], Parliament Hill, Ottawa]]\n\nWhile Arthur was working as an Anglican priest, Murphy explored her new surroundings and became increasingly aware of the poverty that existed.\n\nAt the age of 40, when her children became independent and began their separate lives, Murphy began to actively organize women's groups where the isolated housewives could meet and discuss ideas and plan group projects. In addition to these organizations, Murphy began to speak openly and frankly about the disadvantaged and the poor living conditions that surrounded their society.\n\nHer strong interest in the rights and protection of women and children intensified when she was made aware of an unjust experience of an Albertan woman whose husband sold the family farm; the husband then abandoned his wife and children who were left homeless and penniless. At that time, property laws did not leave the wife with any [[legal recourse]].\n\nThis case motivated Murphy to create a campaign that assured the property rights of married women. With the support of many rural women, Murphy began to pressure the Alberta government to allow women to retain the rights of their land. In 1916, Murphy successfully persuaded the [[Alberta legislature]] to pass the Dower Act that would allow a woman legal rights to one-third of her husband's property. Murphy's reputation as a women's rights activist was established by this first political victory.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\nshe also followed this guy named @shanesuba on Instagram.\n\n===Appointment as female magistrate===\n[[File:WLMK unveiling plaque to Valiant Five.jpg|thumb|right|[[William Lyon Mackenzie King]] unveils a plaque commemorating the five Alberta women whose efforts resulted in the Persons Case.

The women were asked to leave the courtroom on the claims that the statement was not \"fit for mixed company\". This outcome was unacceptable to Murphy and she protested to the provincial Attorney General. \"If the evidence is not fit to be heard in mixed company,\" she argued, \"then the government must set up a special court presided over by women, to try other women\".\n\nMurphy's request was approved and she became the first woman police magistrate in the [[British Empire]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Persons case : the origins and legacy of the fight for legal personhood|last=Sharpe|first=Robert, J|last2=McMahon|first2=Patricia, I.|date=2007|publisher=University of Toronto Press|isbn=978-1-4426-8498-0|location=Toronto|pages=21|oclc=743371175}}</ref>\n\nHer appointment as a judge, however, became the cause for her greatest adversity concerning women within the law. In her first case in Alberta on July 1, 1916, she found the prisoner guilty. The prisoner's lawyer called into question her right to pass sentence since she was not legally a person. The Provincial Supreme Court denied the appeal.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Women's Book of World Records and Achievements|chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/womensbookofworl00onei|chapter-url-access=registration|last=Horowitz |first=Janice M.|editor-last=O'Neill |editor-first=Lois Decker|publisher=Anchor Press |year=1979|page=[https://archive.org/details/womensbookofworl00onei/page/352 352]|chapter=Women in Law and the Justice System|isbn=0-385-12733-2}}</ref>\n\n=== Persons case ===\nIn 1917, she headed the battle to have women declared as \"persons\" in Canada, and, consequently, qualified to serve in the Senate. Lawyer, Eardley Jackson, challenged her position as judge because women were not considered \"persons\" under the [[British North America Act 1867]]. This understanding was based on a British common law ruling of 1876, which stated, \"women were eligible for pains and penalties, but not rights and privileges.\"<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |last=Kaye |first=Frances W. |editor-last=Wishart |editor-first=David J. |title=Persons Case |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of the Great Plains |publisher=University of Nebraska Press |url={{google books|rtRFyFO4hpEC|plainurl=yes|page=320}} |date=2004 |p=320 |isbn=0-80324-787-7|access-date=23 July 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn 1919, she presided over the inaugural conference of the [[Federated Women's Institutes of Canada]], which passed a resolution calling for a female senator to be appointed.

The Court held that women were not qualified to sit in the Senate. The five women then appealed to the [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council]] in Britain.  On 18 October 1929, in a decision called [[Edwards v. Canada (Attorney General)]], the Privy Council declared that 'persons' in Section 24 of the BNA Act of 1867 should be interpreted to include both males and females therefore women were eligible to serve in the Senate.\n\nDespite the ruling, Murphy was never appointed to the Senate. The Prime Minister at the time, [[William Lyon Mackenzie King]], was a [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal]], and Murphy was a partisan Conservative, so she was passed over in favour of philanthropist [[Cairine Wilson]] in 1930. After the Conservatives under [[R. B. Bennett]] won the [[1930 Canadian federal election|1930 federal election]], Murphy was denied to chance to sit in the Senate again in 1931, because the vacancy had been caused by the death of a Catholic senator, and Murphy was a Protestant.

On the other hand, she may have deliberately tried to distance herself from those prejudices, especially the ones propagated by the more vulgar and hysterical Asian exclusionists in [[British Columbia]] in order to maximize her own credibility and sway her more moderate readers.<ref name=Carstairs/>\n\n===Eugenics movement===\nDuring the early twentieth century, [[scientific knowledge]] emerged in the forefront of social importance. Advances in science and technology  were thought to hold answers to current and future social problems.\n\nMurphy was among those who thought that societal problems like alcoholism, drug abuse and crime resulted from mental deficiencies. In a 1932 article titled \"Overpopulation and Birth Control\", she states: \"over-population [is a] basic problem of all&nbsp;... none of our troubles can even be allayed until this is remedied\". As the politics behind the [[Second World War]] continued to develop, Murphy, who was a [[Pacifism|pacifist]], theorized that the only reason for war was that nations needed to fight for land to accommodate their growing populations. Her argument was that: if there was population control, people would not need as much land. Without the constant need for more land, war would cease to exist.\n\nHer solution to these social issues was [[eugenics]]. Murphy supported selective breeding and the compulsory sterilization of those individuals who were considered mentally deficient. She believed that the mentally and socially inferior reproduced more than the \"human thoroughbreds\" and appealed to the [[Alberta Legislative Assembly]] for forced sterilization. In a petition, she wrote that mentally defective children were \"a menace to society and an enormous cost to the state&nbsp;... science is proving that mental defectiveness is a transmittable hereditary condition\". She wrote to Minister of Agriculture and Health, [[George Hoadley (Alberta politician)|George Hoadley]] that two female \"feeble-minded\" mental patients had already bred several offspring. She called it \"a neglect amounting to a crime to permit these two women to go on bearing children\".\n\nDue in part to her heavy advocacy of compulsory sterilization, thousands of Albertan men and women were sterilized without their knowledge or consent under the ''Sexual Sterilization Act'' before its repeal in 1972.\n\n==Legacy==\nHer legacy is disputed, with her important contributions to [[feminism]] being weighed against her racist and [[nativism (politics)|nativist]] views and her advocation of eugenics.

Gowan]], a politician who founded a local branch of the [[Orange Order of Canada|Orange Order]] in 1830, and two uncles, one a Supreme Court justice and the other a senator. Her brother also became a lawyer and another member of the Supreme Court. Another uncle was [[Thomas Roberts Ferguson]], an MP,<ref>{{cite book|editor1-last=Charters|editor1-first=C. V.|title=A history of Peel County: to mark its centenary|date=1967|publisher=The County of Peel|location=Brampton ON|page=150}}</ref> and she was related to [[James Robert Gowan]], who was a lawyer, judge, and senator.\n\nMurphy benefited from parents who supported their daughter's receiving a formal academic education. She attended [[Bishop Strachan School]], an exclusive Anglican private school for girls in Toronto where, through a friend, she met her future husband Arthur Murphy, who was 11 years her senior.\n\nIn 1887, they married, and subsequently had four daughters: Madeleine, Evelyn, Doris and Kathleen. Doris died. After Doris' death, the family decided to try a new setting and moved west to [[Swan River, Manitoba]], in 1903 and then to [[Edmonton|Edmonton, Alberta]], in 1907.\n\n== Career ==\n\n=== Dower Act ===\n[[File:emilymurphy.jpg|left|thumb|Statue of Emily Murphy in the monument to [[The Famous Five (Canada)|The Famous Five]], Parliament Hill, Ottawa]]\n\nWhile Arthur was working as an Anglican priest, Murphy explored her new surroundings and became increasingly aware of the poverty that existed.\n\nAt the age of 40, when her children became independent and began their separate lives, Murphy began to actively organize women's groups where the isolated housewives could meet and discuss ideas and plan group projects. In addition to these organizations, Murphy began to speak openly and frankly about the disadvantaged and the poor living conditions that surrounded their society.\n\nHer strong interest in the rights and protection of women and children intensified when she was made aware of an unjust experience of an Albertan woman whose husband sold the family farm; the husband then abandoned his wife and children who were left homeless and penniless. At that time, property laws did not leave the wife with any [[legal recourse]].\n\nThis case motivated Murphy to create a campaign that assured the property rights of married women. With the support of many rural women, Murphy began to pressure the Alberta government to allow women to retain the rights of their land. In 1916, Murphy successfully persuaded the [[Alberta legislature]] to pass the Dower Act that would allow a woman legal rights to one third of her husband's property. Murphy's reputation as a women's rights activist was established by this first political victory.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\n===Appointment as female magistrate===\n[[File:WLMK unveiling plaque to Valiant Five.jpg|thumb|right|[[William Lyon Mackenzie King]] unveils a plaque commemorating the five Alberta women whose efforts resulted in the Persons Case.

The women were asked to leave the courtroom on the claims that the statement was not \"fit for mixed company\". This outcome was unacceptable to Murphy and she protested to the provincial Attorney General. \"If the evidence is not fit to be heard in mixed company,\" she argued, \"then the government must set up a special court presided over by women, to try other women\".\n\nMurphy's request was approved and she became the first woman police magistrate in the [[British Empire]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Persons case : the origins and legacy of the fight for legal personhood|last=Sharpe|first=Robert, J|last2=McMahon|first2=Patricia, I.|date=2007|publisher=University of Toronto Press|isbn=978-1-4426-8498-0|location=Toronto|pages=21|oclc=743371175}}</ref>\n\nHer appointment as a judge, however, became the cause for her greatest adversity concerning women within the law.

The Court held that women were not qualified to sit in the Senate. The five women then appealed to the [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council]] in Britain.  On 18 October 1929, in a decision called [[Edwards v. Canada (Attorney General)]], the Privy Council declared that 'persons' in Section 24 of the BNA Act of 1867 should be interpreted to include both males and females therefore women were eligible to serve in the Senate.\n\nDespite the ruling, Murphy was never appointed to the Senate. The Prime Minister at the time, [[William Lyon Mackenzie King]], was a [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal]], and Murphy was a partisan Conservative, so she was passed over in favour of philanthropist [[Cairine Wilson]] in 1930. After the Conservatives under [[R. B. Bennett]] won the [[1930 Canadian federal election|1930 federal election]], Murphy was denied to chance to sit in the Senate again in 1931, because the vacancy had been caused by the death of a Catholic senator, and Murphy was a Protestant.

As the politics behind the [[Second World War]] continued to develop, Murphy, who was a [[Pacifism|pacifist]], theorized that the only reason for war was that nations needed to fight for land to accommodate their growing populations. Her argument was that: if there was population control, people would not need as much land. Without the constant need for more land, war would cease to exist.\n\nHer solution to these social issues was [[eugenics]]. Murphy supported selective breeding and the compulsory sterilization of those individuals who were considered mentally deficient. She believed that the mentally and socially inferior reproduced more than the \"human thoroughbreds\" and appealed to the [[Alberta Legislative Assembly]] for forced sterilization. In a petition, she wrote that mentally defective children were \"a menace to society and an enormous cost to the state&nbsp;... science is proving that mental defectiveness is a transmittable hereditary condition\". She wrote to Minister of Agriculture and Health, [[George Hoadley (Alberta politician)|George Hoadley]] that two female \"feeble-minded\" mental patients had already bred several offspring. She called it \"a neglect amounting to a crime to permit these two women to go on bearing children\".\n\nDue in part to her heavy advocacy of compulsory sterilization, thousands of Albertan men and women were sterilized without their knowledge or consent under the ''Sexual Sterilization Act'' before its repeal in 1972.\n\n==Legacy==\nHer legacy is disputed, with her important contributions to [[feminism]] being weighed against her racist and [[nativism (politics)|nativist]] views and her advocation of eugenics. In addition to being against immigration, she was a strong supporter of Alberta's legislation for the ''Sexual Sterilization of the Insane'' at a time when [[compulsory sterilization]] was practised in some North American jurisdictions.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |last=Murphy |first=Emily |date=September 1932 |url=http://www.abheritage.ca/famous5/achievements/reading/sterilization_insane.html |title=Sterilization of the Insane |encyclopedia=Alberta Online Encyclopedia |archive-date=8 December 2010 |archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/2217/20101208161436/http://www.abheritage.ca/famous5/achievements/reading/sterilization_insane.html |access-date=5 April 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Wong |first=Jan |date=17 April 1998 |title=Speech presented as part of the Famous Five Foundation Mentorship series |url=http://www.canuck.com/famous5/html/jan_wong__april_17__1998.html |archive-date=21 March 2005 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050321085700/http://www.canuck.com/famous5/html/jan_wong__april_17__1998.html |publisher=Famous 5 Foundation |access-date=5 April 2007}}</ref>\n\nRecent memorializing of the Famous Five, such as the illustration on the back of the fifty-dollar bill, has been used as the occasion for re-evaluating Murphy's legacy.

The film premiered in the United States on June 8, 2007, and was distributed by [[Columbia Pictures]]. It is a parody of surfing documentaries, such as ''[[The Endless Summer]]'' and ''[[Riding Giants]]'', with parts of the plot parodying ''[[North Shore (1987 film)|North Shore]]''. Real-life surfers [[Kelly Slater]] and [[Rob Machado]] have vignettes as their\n\n==Plot==\nA documentary crew follows the misadventures of Cody Maverick, a 17-year-old [[northern rockhopper penguin]] who lives in Shiverpool, [[Antarctica]], with his mother Edna and his older brother Glen. Cody has yearned to be a professional [[surfer]] ever since meeting Big Z many years ago, so when a talent scout shorebird named Mikey arrives to find entrants for the Big Z Memorial surfing contest, Cody jumps at the chance. En route to the contest, Cody befriends another entrant, Chicken Joe.\n\nThe entrants arrive at Pen Gu Island where Cody meets and immediately falls in love with Lani, a female [[gentoo penguin]] who is a [[lifeguard]]. He also meets arrogant Tank \"The Shredder\" Evans who has won the Big Z Memorial nine times since it was first held after Z's alleged death during a previous match ten years ago. Cody sees him vandalizing Big Z's [[memorial]] and immediately challenges Tank to a surfing duel. Tank easily wins the duel while Cody nearly drowns. Lani rescues him and takes him to her uncle, the \"Geek\", to help Cody recover from his injuries. Cody wakes up and but can't find the souvenir necklace he got as a kid from Big Z. Geek returns the necklace when he finds it in his hut.\n\nWhile returning the necklace, Geek finds Cody sitting on a [[Acacia koa|koa]] log and offers to help him make a perfect surfboard. They attempt to take the log back to Geek's house, only to lose control of it and end up on a [[beach]] far away from the contest. When Cody gets to the beach, he discovers a shack full of old trophies and surfboards, which are actually Z's belongings. After observing Geek sadly looking in the shack, he realizes that Geek is actually Z and asks him to teach him how to surf. Reluctantly, Z agrees, but says that Cody has to make his own board first. The attempt doesn't go well, however, as an impatient Cody doesn't listen to Z's advice and makes an unstable board that shatters as soon as he tries to enter the water. Angry, he storms off, running into Lani, who eventually persuades him to return. All night he works patiently on a new board.\n\nZ compliments Cody on his board, but when Cody is eager to start training, he instead has him do seemingly menial tasks unrelated to surfing. Finally Z and Lani teach him how to surf the waves. Afterwards, Cody asks Z if he'll come watch the contest, but Z refuses, saying he faked his death because he realized he couldn't compete with his then-new rival Tank, and that he was disillusioned. Not impressed that Z just gave up, Cody morosely throws the necklace Z gave him to the sea and leaves, meets up with Joe, and gets back to the contest just as it begins.\n\nTank easily makes it to the finals, as do Cody and Joe. In the semifinals, Tank battles with Cody, with Tank trying to throw him off his board, but Tank falls off his own board and loses. During the finals, however, Tank bursts in and tries to hit Joe off his board. Cody intervenes at the last minute, sending him and Tank out of bounds and into a surfing obstacle known as the Boneyard, which has killed surfers who have ventured there. Tank punches Cody off his board before crashing, and is rescued by Lani. Z, who had been secretly watching Cody's performance, rescues Cody from a gigantic wave and helps him get back to the beach safely.\n\nZ and Cody find out that Joe won by default since Tank and Cody were disqualified. However, Cody accepts the loss, having decided he'd rather just have fun instead. Z reveals himself to the spectators and invites all of them to surf at his beach. Cody finishes his interview with a reflection of the past events and then joins the rest of his friends in the water.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Shia LaBeouf]] as Cody Maverick, a 17-year old teenage [[rockhopper penguin]] who dreams of being a surfer.\n* [[Jeff Bridges]] as Zeke \"Big Z/Geek\" Topanga, Cody's idol and a famous surfer penguin.\n* [[Zooey Deschanel]] as Lani Aliikai, a [[Gentoo penguin]] and Cody's love interest.\n* [[Jon Heder]] as Chicken Joe, a dimwitted [[rooster]].\n* [[Mario Cantone]] as Mikey Abromowitz, a talent scout [[shorebird]].\n* [[James Woods]] as Reggie Belafonte, a short-tempered [[sea otter]], who is Tank's manager.\n* [[Diedrich Bader]] as Tank \"The Shredder\" Evans, Cody's rival.\n* [[Dana Belben]] as Edna Maverick, Cody's mother.\n* [[Brian Posehn]] as Glen Maverick, Cody's older brother.\n* [[Kelly Slater]] as the penguin version of himself\n* [[Rob Machado]] as the penguin version of himself\n* [[Ash Brannon]] as himself\n* [[Chris Buck]] as himself\n* [[Selema Masekela|Sal Masekela]] as himself\n* Reed Buck as Arnold\n* Reese Elowe as Kate\n* Jack P.

On June 8, 2007, [[McDonald's]] issued eight ''Surf's Up'' toys in their [[Happy Meals]] for one month. In the Australian market, a few small [[Stuffed animal|plush]] characters of Cody, Lani, Chicken Joe, and Geek replace some of the toys in the US lineup. There was also a tie-in with the candy [[Air Heads]] which introduces a \"New Wave\" flavor (pineapple) and four collectible [[Lenticular printing|lenticular]] motion surf board shaped pieces. [[Build A Bear]] stores sold plush toys of the film's protagonist, Cody Maverick. Patrons could \"build\" their own Cody as well as dress him up in an array of surf-themed clothing and other accessories in Build A Bear workshops. They could also purchase Cody and accessories at the official site. Several plushes from Nanco intended for claw machines can also be found and purchased in varying sizes (from 6&nbsp;inches to 11&nbsp;inches to 17&nbsp;inches). Characters available: Cody, Lani, Tank, Geek, Big Z, Chicken Joe, and Reggie Belefonte. A rare set of larger (Geek measures 15&nbsp;inches) and higher quality plushes had been made available at the premiere's after party. Won either through available games, or given away with gift sets for attendees. Cody, Lani, Arnold and Geek were created and so far no plans for the dolls to be sold commercially have appeared. A series of children's 100 piece puzzles are available as well depicting various characters and setups. Five inch waterproof plush tub toys released by [[Jakks Pacific]] in minimal quantities to most major retailers. Five characters were produced, including Cody, Tank, Big Z, Arnold, & Chicken Joe. Each character has an attached washcloth/surfboard, but sport questionable likenesses (and in the case of Chicken Joe, entirely off model, bearing more of a resemblance to Mikey). Along with the release of the film, a companion [[Surf's Up (video game)|''Surf's Up'' video game]] was released by [[Ubisoft]] for all the current video gaming systems on the market. All versions of the game are the same with mild graphical differences, with only the [[Nintendo DS]] version changing the overall format.\n\n===Home media===\n''Surf's Up'' was released on high-definition [[Blu-ray Disc]], PSP [[Universal Media Disc|UMD]] Video and [[DVD]] in the [[United States]] on October 9, 2007.

The film premiered in the United States on June 8, 2007, and was distributed by [[Columbia Pictures]]. It is a parody of surfing documentaries, such as ''[[The Endless Summer]]'' and ''[[Riding Giants]]'', with parts of the plot parodying ''[[North Shore (1987 film)|North Shore]]''. Real-life surfers [[Kelly Slater]] and [[Rob Machado]] have vignettes as their penguin surfer counterparts. To obtain the desired hand-held documentary feel, the film's animation team motion-captured a physical camera operator's moves. It was also nominated at the [[80th Academy Awards|80th]] [[Academy Awards]] for [[Academy Award for Best Animated Feature|Best Animated Feature]], losing to [[Pixar]]'s ''[[Ratatouille (film)|Ratatouille]]''. A sequel, titled ''[[Surf's Up 2: WaveMania]]'', was released direct-to-video on January 17, 2017. \n==Plot==\nA documentary crew follows the misadventures of Cody Maverick, a 17-year-old [[northern rockhopper penguin]] who lives in Shiverpool, [[Antarctica]], with his mother Edna and his older brother Glen. Cody has yearned to be a professional [[surfer]] ever since meeting Big Z many years ago, so when a talent scout shorebird named Mikey arrives to find entrants for the Big Z Memorial surfing contest, Cody jumps at the chance. En route to the contest, Cody befriends another entrant, Chicken Joe.\n\nThe entrants arrive at Pen Gu Island where Cody meets and immediately falls in love with Lani, a female [[gentoo penguin]] who is a [[lifeguard]]. He also meets arrogant Tank \"The Shredder\" Evans who has won the Big Z Memorial nine times since it was first held after Z's alleged death during a previous match ten years ago. Cody sees him vandalizing Big Z's [[memorial]] and immediately challenges Tank to a surfing duel. Tank easily wins the duel while Cody nearly drowns. Lani rescues him and takes him to her uncle, the \"Geek\", to help Cody recover from his injuries. Cody wakes up and but can't find the souvenir necklace he got as a kid from Big Z. Geek returns the necklace when he finds it in his hut.\n\nWhile returning the necklace, Geek finds Cody sitting on a [[Acacia koa|koa]] log and offers to help him make a perfect surfboard. They attempt to take the log back to Geek's house, only to lose control of it and end up on a [[beach]] far away from the contest. When Cody gets to the beach, he discovers a shack full of old trophies and surfboards, which are actually Z's belongings. After observing Geek sadly looking in the shack, he realizes that Geek is actually Z and asks him to teach him how to surf. Reluctantly, Z agrees, but says that Cody has to make his own board first. The attempt doesn't go well, however, as an impatient Cody doesn't listen to Z's advice and makes an unstable board that shatters as soon as he tries to enter the water. Angry, he storms off, running into Lani, who eventually persuades him to return. All night he works patiently on a new board.\n\nZ compliments Cody on his board, but when Cody is eager to start training, he instead has him do seemingly menial tasks unrelated to surfing. Finally Z and Lani teach him how to surf the waves. Afterwards, Cody asks Z if he'll come watch the contest, but Z refuses, saying he faked his death because he realized he couldn't compete with his then-new rival Tank, and that he was disillusioned. Not impressed that Z just gave up, Cody morosely throws the necklace Z gave him to the sea and leaves, meets up with Joe, and gets back to the contest just as it begins.\n\nTank easily makes it to the finals, as do Cody and Joe. In the semifinals, Tank battles with Cody, with Tank trying to throw him off his board, but Tank falls off his own board and loses. During the finals, however, Tank bursts in and tries to hit Joe off his board. Cody intervenes at the last minute, sending him and Tank out of bounds and into a surfing obstacle known as the Boneyard, which has killed surfers who have ventured there. Tank punches Cody off his board before crashing, and is rescued by Lani. Z, who had been secretly watching Cody's performance, rescues Cody from a gigantic wave and helps him get back to the beach safely.\n\nZ and Cody find out that Joe won by default since Tank and Cody were disqualified. However, Cody accepts the loss, having decided he'd rather just have fun instead. Z reveals himself to the spectators and invites all of them to surf at his beach. Cody finishes his interview with a reflection of the past events and then joins the rest of his friends in the water.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Shia LaBeouf]] as Cody Maverick, a 17-year old teenage [[rockhopper penguin]] who dreams of being a surfer.\n* [[Jeff Bridges]] as Zeke \"Big Z/Geek\" Topanga, Cody's idol and a famous surfer penguin.\n* [[Zooey Deschanel]] as Lani Aliikai, a [[Gentoo penguin]] and Cody's love interest.\n* [[Jon Heder]] as Chicken Joe, a dimwitted [[rooster]].\n* [[Mario Cantone]] as Mikey Abromowitz, a talent scout [[shorebird]].\n* [[James Woods]] as Reggie Belafonte, a short-tempered [[sea otter]], who is Tank's manager.\n* [[Diedrich Bader]] as Tank \"The Shredder\" Evans, Cody's rival.\n* [[Dana Belben]] as Edna Maverick, Cody's mother.\n* [[Brian Posehn]] as Glen Maverick, Cody's older brother.\n* [[Kelly Slater]] as the penguin version of himself\n* [[Rob Machado]] as the penguin version of himself\n* [[Ash Brannon]] as himself\n* [[Chris Buck]] as himself\n* [[Selema Masekela|Sal Masekela]] as himself\n* Reed Buck as Arnold\n* Reese Elowe as Kate\n* Jack P.

On June 8, 2007, [[McDonald's]] issued eight ''Surf's Up'' toys in their [[Happy Meals]] for one month. In the Australian market, a few small [[Stuffed animal|plush]] characters of Cody, Lani, Chicken Joe, and Geek replace some of the toys in the US lineup. There was also a tie-in with the candy [[Air Heads]] which introduces a \"New Wave\" flavor (pineapple) and four collectible [[Lenticular printing|lenticular]] motion surf board shaped pieces. [[Build A Bear]] stores sold plush toys of the film's protagonist, Cody Maverick. Patrons could \"build\" their own Cody as well as dress him up in an array of surf-themed clothing and other accessories in Build A Bear workshops. They could also purchase Cody and accessories at the official site. Several plushes from Nanco intended for claw machines can also be found and purchased in varying sizes (from 6&nbsp;inches to 11&nbsp;inches to 17&nbsp;inches). Characters available: Cody, Lani, Tank, Geek, Big Z, Chicken Joe, and Reggie Belefonte. A rare set of larger (Geek measures 15&nbsp;inches) and higher quality plushes had been made available at the premiere's after party. Won either through available games, or given away with gift sets for attendees. Cody, Lani, Arnold and Geek were created and so far no plans for the dolls to be sold commercially have appeared. A series of children's 100 piece puzzles are available as well depicting various characters and setups. Five inch waterproof plush tub toys released by [[Jakks Pacific]] in minimal quantities to most major retailers. Five characters were produced, including Cody, Tank, Big Z, Arnold, & Chicken Joe. Each character has an attached washcloth/surfboard, but sport questionable likenesses (and in the case of Chicken Joe, entirely off model, bearing more of a resemblance to Mikey). Along with the release of the film, a companion [[Surf's Up (video game)|''Surf's Up'' video game]] was released by [[Ubisoft]] for all the current video gaming systems on the market.

Its first railway was the first line in Switzerland, the so-called [[Spanisch-Br\u00f6tli-Bahn]] that opened in 1847, and that line now carries long distance passenger trains, freight trains and suburban trains of the [[Z\u00fcrich S-Bahn]]. However the stations of the S-Bahn are well separated, with only five stations in the distance to be covered by the Limmattal line. The [[Limmattal tramway]] provided more local transport from 1900, but closed in stages between 1928 and 1955, being replaced by buses. The roads of the Limmat Valley are now at capacity, leading to delays to both bus and car traffic. It estimated that traffic will continue to grow, with 113,000 extra journeys a day by 2030.<ref name=Port>{{cite web |url=https://www.limmattalbahn.ch/home/vision/portrait.html |language=German |title=Portrait |publisher=Limmattalbahn AG |accessdate=31 May 2018 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180531142617/https://www.limmattalbahn.ch/home/vision/portrait.html |archivedate=31 May 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIt is against this background that the Limmattal light rail line was proposed as a solution. Planning began in 2000, and by 2007 the line was included in the cantonal plans of Aargau and Z\u00fcrich. In 2010, the Limmattalbahn AG company was founded by the cantons to plan and implement the infrastructure for the line. A referendum, held in November 2015, approved the construction of the line, and it was announced in May 2016 that the line would be operated by [[BDWM Transport]], who also operate the [[Bremgarten\u2013Dietikon railway line|Bremgarten\u2013Dietikon line]]. Construction commenced in August 2017, and phase 1 between Farbhof and Schlieren opened in September 2019. A further referendum called by opponents in the canton of Z\u00fcrich in an attempt to have phase 2 cancelled was defeated, and the line is expected to be fully opened throughout in 2022.<ref name=OpOff/><ref name=wmr/><ref name=rgifpl/><ref name=Port/><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nzz.ch/zuerich/aktuell/zuerich-sagt-ja-zur-limmattalbahn-ld.3186 |first1=Stefan |last1=Hotz |first2=Andr\u00e9 |last2=M\u00fcller |title=Nur das Limmattal selbst stimmt gegen \u00absein\u00bb neues Tram |language=German |trans-title=Only the Limmattal itself voted against \"its\" new tram |work=Neue Z\u00fcrcher Zeitung |date=22 November 2015 |accessdate=27 February 2017 |archivedate=28 February 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170228082218/https://www.nzz.ch/zuerich/aktuell/zuerich-sagt-ja-zur-limmattalbahn-ld.3186}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nzz.ch/zuerich/aktuell/bdwm-transport-ag-aargauer-betreiben-zuercher-limmattalbahn-ld.82405 |first=Corsin |last=Zander |title=Aargauer betreiben Z\u00fcrcher Limmattalbahn |language=German |trans-title=Aargau company to operate Z\u00fcrcher Limmattalbahn |work=Neue Z\u00fcrcher Zeitung |date=13 May 2016 |accessdate=27 February 2017 |archivedate=28 February 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170228075100/https://www.nzz.ch/zuerich/aktuell/bdwm-transport-ag-aargauer-betreiben-zuercher-limmattalbahn-ld.82405}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.srf.ch/news/regional/zuerich-schaffhausen/2-etappe-limmattalbahn-ein-baustopp-bleibt-im-zuercher-kantonsparlament-ohne-chance |title=Ein Baustopp bleibt im Z\u00fcrcher Kantonsparlament ohne Chance |language=German |trans-title=A freeze on construction in the Zurich Cantonal Parliament will have no chance |publisher=Swiss Radio and Television |date=9 April 2018 |accessdate=3 June 2018 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180605101548/https://www.srf.ch/news/regional/zuerich-schaffhausen/2-etappe-limmattalbahn-ein-baustopp-bleibt-im-zuercher-kantonsparlament-ohne-chance |archivedate=5 June 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.proaktiva.ch/tram/zurich/newslog/newsitem.php?year=2018&item=240918 |title=83 percent want Limmattalbahn |first=Andrew |last=Moglestue |date=24 September 2018 |accessdate=27 November 2018 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20181127130631/http://www.proaktiva.ch/tram/zurich/newslog/newsitem.php?year=2018&item=240918 |archivedate=27 November 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nWhen fully open, light rail trains will run every 15 minutes between [[Z\u00fcrich-Altstetten railway station|Z\u00fcrich-Altstetten]] and [[Killwangen-Spreitenbach railway station|Killwangen-Spreitenbach]] stations, with the ability to later increase the frequency to every 7.5 minutes.

Its first railway was the first line in Switzerland, the so-called [[Spanisch-Br\u00f6tli-Bahn]] that opened in 1847, and that line now carries long distance passenger trains, freight trains and suburban trains of the [[Z\u00fcrich S-Bahn]]. However the stations of the S-Bahn are well separated, with only five stations in the distance to be covered by the Limmattal line. The [[Limmattal tramway]] provided more local transport from 1900, but closed in stages between 1928 and 1955, being replaced by buses. The roads of the Limmat Valley are now at capacity, leading to delays to both bus and car traffic. It estimated that traffic will continue to grow, with 113,000 extra journeys a day by 2030.<ref name=Port>{{cite web |url=https://www.limmattalbahn.ch/home/vision/portrait.html |language=German |title=Portrait |publisher=Limmattalbahn AG |accessdate=31 May 2018 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180531142617/https://www.limmattalbahn.ch/home/vision/portrait.html |archivedate=31 May 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIt is against this background that the Limmattal light rail line was proposed as a solution. Planning began in 2000, and by 2007 the line was included in the cantonal plans of Aargau and Z\u00fcrich. In 2010, the Limmattalbahn AG company was founded by the cantons to plan and implement the infrastructure for the line. A referendum, held in November 2015, approved the construction of the line, and it was announced in May 2016 that the line would be operated by [[BDWM Transport]], who also operate the [[Bremgarten\u2013Dietikon railway line|Bremgarten\u2013Dietikon line]]. Construction commenced in August 2017, and phase 1 between Farbhof and Schlieren opened in September 2019. A further referendum called by opponents in the canton of Z\u00fcrich in an attempt to have phase 2 cancelled was defeated, and the line is expected to be fully opened throughout in 2022.<ref name=OpOff/><ref name=wmr/><ref name=rgifpl/><ref name=Port/><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nzz.ch/zuerich/aktuell/zuerich-sagt-ja-zur-limmattalbahn-ld.3186 |first1=Stefan |last1=Hotz |first2=Andr\u00e9 |last2=M\u00fcller |title=Nur das Limmattal selbst stimmt gegen \u00absein\u00bb neues Tram |language=German |trans-title=Only the Limmattal itself voted against \"its\" new tram |work=Neue Z\u00fcrcher Zeitung |date=22 November 2015 |accessdate=27 February 2017 |archivedate=28 February 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170228082218/https://www.nzz.ch/zuerich/aktuell/zuerich-sagt-ja-zur-limmattalbahn-ld.3186}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nzz.ch/zuerich/aktuell/bdwm-transport-ag-aargauer-betreiben-zuercher-limmattalbahn-ld.82405 |first=Corsin |last=Zander |title=Aargauer betreiben Z\u00fcrcher Limmattalbahn |language=German |trans-title=Aargau company to operate Z\u00fcrcher Limmattalbahn |work=Neue Z\u00fcrcher Zeitung |date=13 May 2016 |accessdate=27 February 2017 |archivedate=28 February 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170228075100/https://www.nzz.ch/zuerich/aktuell/bdwm-transport-ag-aargauer-betreiben-zuercher-limmattalbahn-ld.82405}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.srf.ch/news/regional/zuerich-schaffhausen/2-etappe-limmattalbahn-ein-baustopp-bleibt-im-zuercher-kantonsparlament-ohne-chance |title=Ein Baustopp bleibt im Z\u00fcrcher Kantonsparlament ohne Chance |language=German |trans-title=A freeze on construction in the Zurich Cantonal Parliament will have no chance |publisher=Swiss Radio and Television |date=9 April 2018 |accessdate=3 June 2018 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180605101548/https://www.srf.ch/news/regional/zuerich-schaffhausen/2-etappe-limmattalbahn-ein-baustopp-bleibt-im-zuercher-kantonsparlament-ohne-chance |archivedate=5 June 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.proaktiva.ch/tram/zurich/newslog/newsitem.php?year=2018&item=240918 |title=83 percent want Limmattalbahn |first=Andrew |last=Moglestue |date=24 September 2018 |accessdate=27 November 2018 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20181127130631/http://www.proaktiva.ch/tram/zurich/newslog/newsitem.php?year=2018&item=240918 |archivedate=27 November 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nWhen fully open, light rail trains will run every 15 minutes between [[Z\u00fcrich-Altstetten railway station|Z\u00fcrich-Altstetten]] and [[Killwangen-Spreitenbach railway station|Killwangen-Spreitenbach]] stations, with the ability to later increase the frequency to every 7.5 minutes.

Chamoiseau is the author of a historical work on the [[Antilles]] under the reign of [[Napoleon I of France|Napol\u00e9on Bonaparte]] and several non-fiction books which include ''\u00c9loge de la [[cr\u00e9olit\u00e9]]'' (In Praise of Creoleness), co-authored with [[Jean Bernab\u00e9]] and [[Rapha\u00ebl Confiant]]. \nAwarded the [[Prix Carbet de la Cara\u00efbe et du Tout-Monde|Prix Carbet]] (1990) for ''Antan d\u2019enfance''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tout-monde.com/pdf/2009-DP-PrixCarbet.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=21 February 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717080226/http://www.tout-monde.com/pdf/2009-DP-PrixCarbet.pdf |archivedate=17 July 2011 }}</ref> ''Antan d'enfance'',  ''Chemin d'\u00e9cole'' and ''\u00c0 Bout d'enfance'' form the autobiographical trilogy ''Une enfance Cr\u00e9ole''. His novel ''[[Texaco (novel)|Texaco]]'' was awarded the [[Prix Goncourt]] in 1992, and was chosen as a ''[[New York Times]]'' ''Notable Book of the Year''. It has been described as \"a masterpiece, the work of a genius, a novel that deserves to be known as much as Fanon\u2019s ''[[The Wretched of the Earth]]'' and Cesaire\u2019s ''[[Return to My Native Land]]''.<ref>[http://mg.co.za/article/2012-08-24-refuge-for-the-wretched Refuge for the wretched], by PERCY ZVOMUYA, ''Mail & Guardian'', 24 August 2012.</ref>\n\nIn 1998, Chamoiseau was honoured with a [[Prince Claus Award]] for his contribution to Caribbean society.\n\nChamoiseau may also safely be considered as one of the most innovative writers to hit the French literary scene since [[Louis-Ferdinand C\u00e9line]]. His freeform use of French language \u2014 a highly complex yet fluid mixture of constant invention and \"creolism\" \u2014 fuels a poignant and sensuous depiction of Martinique people in particular and humanity at large.\n\n== Writing Style and Approach ==\n\n=== Masculinity versus Femininity ===\nThe dynamics and relationship between men and women has been a long-time subject of literature in the Caribbean. The concept of \u2018[[masculinity]]\u2019 versus \u2018[[femininity]]\u2019 is a literary theme that is indicative of Caribbean literature. Patrick Chamoiseau, like many other authors from the Caribbean, uses this theme in many of his literary works. However, as there are a larger number of male writer that come out of the Caribbean, this topic of conversation is primarily male driven, and takes the \u2018masculinist\u2019 perspective.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Gaeta|first=Jill M.|date=2010|title=Reevaluating the 'Masculine' and 'Feminine': Patrick Chamoiseau's \"Kosto et ses deux enfants\"|journal=The French Review|volume=84|issue=1|pages=140\u2013149|issn=0016-111X|jstor=25758340}}</ref>\n\nChamoiseau has often been criticized as being a somewhat patriarchal literary figure after having founded the masculinist Cr\u00e9olit\u00e9 movement in the [[Antilles|Antilles archipelago]]. The founding of this movement was intended to bring pride and nationalism to the male Antillean population that had been emasculated for centuries by being barred from holding positions of power and authority by their European colonizers. The practice of slavery can be argued to have had a more detrimental effect on the male slave population than the female slave population, as white slave owners attempting to have sexual affairs with female slaves would often offer them more privileges compared to their male counterparts. However, his literary work in the children's book \"Kosto et ses deux enfants\" is in stark contrast to his typical patriarchal and masculine nature.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Gaeta|first=Jill M.|date=2010|title=Reevaluating the 'Masculine' and 'Feminine': Patrick Chamoiseau's \"Kosto et ses deux enfants\"|journal=The French Review|volume=84|issue=1|pages=140\u2013149|issn=0016-111X|jstor=25758340}}</ref>\n\nThe representation of men in Caribbean literature is typically portrayed in a negative light; however, in Chamoiseau's children's book \"Kosto et ses deux enfants,\" this theme is contrasted by the main male character becoming an upstanding and respectable father figure.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Gaeta|first=Jill M.|date=2010|title=Reevaluating the 'Masculine' and 'Feminine': Patrick Chamoiseau's \"Kosto et ses deux enfants\"|journal=The French Review|volume=84|issue=1|pages=140\u2013149|issn=0016-111X|jstor=25758340}}</ref>\n\n=== [[Cr\u00e9olit\u00e9]] ===\nA question that many writers from the Caribbean try to answer is 'What does it mean to be Caribbean?'. This question is the subject of a search for identity, and the word that Chamoiseau and his colleagues used to answer this question is \"Creoleness\". Creoleness refers to how different cultures adapt and blend together on islands or isolated areas, which in the case of the Caribbean, refers to the blending of African, Polynesian, and Asian cultures with that of their European colonizers. This idea of Creoleness contrasts the idea of \"Americanness\" in that it existed prior to America, and that \"Americanness\" excludes it interaction with the indigenous population.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Gaeta|first=Jill M.|date=2010|title=Reevaluating the 'Masculine' and 'Feminine': Patrick Chamoiseau's \"Kosto et ses deux enfants\"|journal=The French Review|volume=84|issue=1|pages=140\u2013149|issn=0016-111X|jstor=25758340}}</ref>\n\nThis relates to Patrick Chamoiseau's writing style in that his choices are purposeful as his overall goal is to express this concept of Creoleness. ''Creole Folktales'' is a prime example from his works. The collection itself takes place around the 17th century in the French Antilles and Chamoiseau casts storyteller-narrator and uses creole in order to recreate the tradition of storytelling in the Antilles that was primarily oral. Chamoiseau chooses these aspects to add to his writings as oral and historical accuracy are important in the representation of the Antilles and are crucial in bring awareness to Creoleness.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Gaeta|first=Jill M.|date=2010|title=Reevaluating the 'Masculine' and 'Feminine': Patrick Chamoiseau's \"Kosto et ses deux enfants\"|journal=The French Review|volume=84|issue=1|pages=140\u2013149|issn=0016-111X|jstor=25758340}}</ref>\n\n==Works==\n\n===Novels===\n* ''Chronique des sept mis\u00e8res'' (1986).

After he studied law in [[Paris]] he returned to Martinique inspired by [[\u00c9douard Glissant]] to take a close interest in Creole culture. Chamoiseau is the author of a historical work on the [[Antilles]] under the reign of [[Napoleon I of France|Napol\u00e9on Bonaparte]] and several non-fiction books which include ''\u00c9loge de la [[cr\u00e9olit\u00e9]]'' (In Praise of Creoleness), co-authored with [[Jean Bernab\u00e9]] and [[Rapha\u00ebl Confiant]]. \nAwarded the [[Prix Carbet de la Cara\u00efbe et du Tout-Monde|Prix Carbet]] (1990) for ''Antan d\u2019enfance''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tout-monde.com/pdf/2009-DP-PrixCarbet.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=21 February 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717080226/http://www.tout-monde.com/pdf/2009-DP-PrixCarbet.pdf |archivedate=17 July 2011 }}</ref> ''Antan d'enfance'',  ''Chemin d'\u00e9cole'' and ''\u00c0 Bout d'enfance'' form the autobiographical trilogy ''Une enfance Cr\u00e9ole''. His novel ''[[Texaco (novel)|Texaco]]'' was awarded the [[Prix Goncourt]] in 1992, and was chosen as a ''[[New York Times]]'' ''Notable Book of the Year''. It has been described as \"a masterpiece, the work of a genius, a novel that deserves to be known as much as Fanon\u2019s ''[[The Wretched of the Earth]]'' and Cesaire\u2019s ''[[Return to My Native Land]]''.<ref>[http://mg.co.za/article/2012-08-24-refuge-for-the-wretched Refuge for the wretched], by PERCY ZVOMUYA, ''Mail & Guardian'', 24 August 2012.</ref>\n\nIn 1998, Chamoiseau was honoured with a [[Prince Claus Award]] for his contribution to Caribbean society.\n\nChamoiseau may also safely be considered as one of the most innovative writers to hit the French literary scene since [[Louis-Ferdinand C\u00e9line]]. His freeform use of French language \u2014 a highly complex yet fluid mixture of constant invention and \"creolism\" \u2014 fuels a poignant and sensuous depiction of Martinique people in particular and humanity at large.\n\n== Writing Style and Approach ==\n\n=== Masculinity versus Femininity ===\nThe dynamics and relationship between men and women has been a long-time subject of literature in the Caribbean. The concept of \u2018[[masculinity]]\u2019 versus \u2018[[femininity]]\u2019 is a literary theme that is indicative of Caribbean literature. Patrick Chamoiseau, like many other authors from the Caribbean, uses this theme in many of his literary works. However, as there are a larger number of male writer that come out of the Caribbean, this topic of conversation is primarily male driven, and takes the \u2018masculinist\u2019 perspective.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Gaeta|first=Jill M.|date=2010|title=Reevaluating the 'Masculine' and 'Feminine': Patrick Chamoiseau's \"Kosto et ses deux enfants\"|journal=The French Review|volume=84|issue=1|pages=140\u2013149|issn=0016-111X|jstor=25758340}}</ref>\n\nChamoiseau has often been criticized as being a somewhat patriarchal literary figure after having founded the masculinist Cr\u00e9olit\u00e9 movement in the [[Antilles|Antilles archipelago]]. The founding of this movement was intended to bring pride and nationalism to the male Antillean population that had been emasculated for centuries by being barred from holding positions of power and authority by their European colonizers. The practice of slavery can be argued to have had a more detrimental effect on the male slave population than the female slave population, as white slave owners attempting to have sexual affairs with female slaves would often offer them more privileges compared to their male counterparts. However, his literary work in the children's book \"Kosto et ses deux enfants\" is in stark contrast to his typical patriarchal and masculine nature.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Gaeta|first=Jill M.|date=2010|title=Reevaluating the 'Masculine' and 'Feminine': Patrick Chamoiseau's \"Kosto et ses deux enfants\"|journal=The French Review|volume=84|issue=1|pages=140\u2013149|issn=0016-111X|jstor=25758340}}</ref>\n\nThe representation of men in Caribbean literature is typically portrayed in a negative light; however, in Chamoiseau's children's book \"Kosto et ses deux enfants,\" this theme is contrasted by the main male character becoming an upstanding and respectable father figure.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Gaeta|first=Jill M.|date=2010|title=Reevaluating the 'Masculine' and 'Feminine': Patrick Chamoiseau's \"Kosto et ses deux enfants\"|journal=The French Review|volume=84|issue=1|pages=140\u2013149|issn=0016-111X|jstor=25758340}}</ref>\n\n=== [[Cr\u00e9olit\u00e9]] ===\nA question that many writers from the Caribbean try to answer is 'What does it mean to be Caribbean?'. This question is the subject of a search for identity, and the word that Chamoiseau and his colleagues used to answer this question is \"Creoleness\". Creoleness refers to how different cultures adapt and blend together on islands or isolated areas, which in the case of the Caribbean, refers to the blending of African, Polynesian, and Asian cultures with that of their European colonizers. This idea of Creoleness contrasts the idea of \"Americanness\" in that it existed prior to America, and that \"Americanness\" excludes it interaction with the indigenous population.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Gaeta|first=Jill M.|date=2010|title=Reevaluating the 'Masculine' and 'Feminine': Patrick Chamoiseau's \"Kosto et ses deux enfants\"|journal=The French Review|volume=84|issue=1|pages=140\u2013149|issn=0016-111X|jstor=25758340}}</ref>\n\nThis relates to Patrick Chamoiseau's writing style in that his choices are purposeful as his overall goal is to express this concept of Creoleness. ''Creole Folktales'' is a prime example from his works. The collection itself takes place around the 17th century in the French Antilles and Chamoiseau casts storyteller-narrator and uses creole in order to recreate the tradition of storytelling in the Antilles that was primarily oral. Chamoiseau chooses these aspects to add to his writings as oral and historical accuracy are important in the representation of the Antilles and are crucial in bring awareness to Creoleness.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Gaeta|first=Jill M.|date=2010|title=Reevaluating the 'Masculine' and 'Feminine': Patrick Chamoiseau's \"Kosto et ses deux enfants\"|journal=The French Review|volume=84|issue=1|pages=140\u2013149|issn=0016-111X|jstor=25758340}}</ref>\n\n==Works==\n\n===Novels===\n* ''Chronique des sept mis\u00e8res'' (1986).
