The show started streaming in March 2015, partway through the cast's first campaign. \"Campaign One\" ran for 115 episodes, and ended in October 2017. The cast started playing \"Campaign Two\" in January 2018, which is still ongoing {{As of|2020|04|lc=y|df=}}. A number of one-shots were aired in the [[Hiatus (television)|hiatus]] between the two campaigns.\n\nThe series is broadcast live on Thursdays at 19:00&nbsp;[[Pacific Time Zone|PT]] on the Critical Role [[Twitch (service)|Twitch]] channel, with the [[video on demand]] (VOD) being available to Twitch subscribers immediately after the broadcast. On the Monday following the live stream, the VODs are made available for the public on Critical Role's website and uploaded to their [[YouTube]] channel.\n\nA number of licensed works based on the show have been released, such as the official campaign setting guide written by the show's dungeon master, [[Matthew Mercer]].\n\nCritical Role is also the name of the studio owned by the cast. The studio has produced ''Critical Role'' and ''Talks Machina'' since 2018. It also develops and produces other programming for the studio's Twitch and YouTube channels.\n\n==Campaign structure==\nThe ''Critical Role'' storyline occurs in a [[Campaign (role-playing games)|campaign]] that consists of a series of story arcs, which are usually played over multiple episodes. Between\u2014or sometimes within\u2014the major story arcs, the characters rest, resupply, or go on side quests. In addition, every player character has a [[backstory]], an unfinished part of their personal history that can be relevant to the campaign from time to time. Sometimes, major story arcs are intrinsically tied to a character's backstory.\n\nBoth campaigns are set in Exandria, a world of Matthew Mercer's creation.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/toddkenreck/2017/06/06/matthew-mercer-on-critical-roles-taldorei-campaign-setting-guide/ |title=Matthew Mercer On Critical Role's Tal'Dorei Campaign Setting Guide |work=[[Forbes]] |last=Kenreck |first=Todd |date=June 6, 2017 |accessdate=May 12, 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Campaign one===\nCampaign one [[Campaign setting|takes place]] primarily in Tal'Dorei, a continent of Exandria. It follows the exploits of an adventuring party known as '''Vox Machina''', previously known as the Super High-Intensity Team (or S.H.I.T.s), a rag-tag group of mercenaries originally formed in the swamp-town of Stilben.\n\n====Pre-series history====\nIn their adventures prior to the start of the series, the group saved the family of Sovereign Uriel Tal'Dorei III, ruler of Tal'Dorei and its capital city of Emon. In appreciation, Uriel gave the group seats on the city [[council]], and provided them with a residence called Greyskull Keep, which is located just outside the city. Episode 36, titled ''Winter's Crest in Whitestone'', features a summary of the pre-series history (starting 1 hour 35 minutes into the episode), with artwork created by Wendy Sullivan Green and voice-overs provided by the cast.<ref>{{cite AV media |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EikRMYRf5-Y&t=96m21s |title=Winter's Crest in Whitestone : Critical Role RPG Show Episode 36 - The Story of Vox Machina |publisher=Geek & Sundry |date=December 18, 2015 |medium=Youtube video |time=1:36:21 |access-date=May 20, 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe forthcoming ''Critical Role'' animated series will include a canonic story that takes place within the pre-stream time frame.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/criticalrole/critical-role-the-legend-of-vox-machina-animated-s/description |title=Critical Role: The Legend of Vox Machina Animated Special |website=Kickstarter |accessdate=May 9, 2019 |quote=\"... the first few episodes of our animation will focus on a brand new Vox Machina adventure, which takes place before our show began streaming live on Twitch.\"}}</ref>\n\n====On-stream campaign====\nThe first episode of the show aired on March 12, 2015, beginning the on-stream part of the first campaign, which concluded with its 115th and final episode on October 12, 2017.<ref name=\"bleedingcool\"/><ref>{{cite tweet |number=920015612184686592 |title=The end. |user=CriticalRole |author=Critical Role |date=October 16, 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe Kraghammer story arc (16 episodes, 1\u201316) jumps in at the point in Vox Machina's story where the cast's original home game left off. It takes place primarily in the subterrenean depths of the [[Underdark]], and culminates in a battle between Vox Machina and a dangerous [[Beholder (Dungeons & Dragons)|beholder]] by the name of K'varn, who is controlling an entire city of [[Illithid]].\n\nThe Vasselheim story arc (7 episodes, 17\u201323) splits the party into two groups, who seek to prove their worth to the \"Slayer's Take\", a local adventurer's guild in the ancient city of Vasselheim, by taking on dangerous missions. This arc features multi-episode [[guest appearance]]s by [[Felicia Day]] (Lyra), [[Mary Elizabeth McGlynn]] (Zahra), [[Wil Wheaton]] (Thorbir), and [[Will Friedle]] (Kashaw), adding a new twist to the now-divided adventuring band. This arc also includes the first episode (episode 22) that touches on a character's backstory, as Keyleth visits another druid tribe to continue her Arament\u00e9, a journey to become the leader of her people.\n\nThe Briarwood story arc (15 episodes, 24\u201338) leads Vox Machina to Percy's ancestral home, the city of Whitestone, which was once ruled by his family. The party have to fight for control over Whitestone against Lord and Lady Briarwood, who are responsible for the demise of most of the de Rolo family and have taken the city as their own. The Briarwood's ties into necromancy and a secret cult make things even more dangerous, and Vox Machina must stop them from completing a ritual that threatens to endanger the entire kingdom. During the early stages of this arc, Tiberius leaves Vox Machina for good.\n\nThe Chroma Conclave story arc (45 episodes, 39\u201383) begins with the attack of four ancient [[chromatic dragon]]s on Emon, the capital of Tal'Dorei, with the Sovereign and other important political figures falling in the onslaught. The dragons take control over and divide the kingdom, and in order to defeat them, Vox Machina needs more power than they currently have. They search for the \"Vestiges of Divergence\", famed and extremely powerful magical items from ages passed, which are scattered throughout the world. During the ongoing battles against the powerful dragons of the Chroma Conclave, the backstories of some characters are also further explored. Smaller arcs focus on Grog's herd that once exiled him, the last figure from Percy's traumatic past, as well as a strained family reunion for the twins, Vex and Vax.\n\nThe Taryon Darrington story arc (16 episodes, 84\u201399) begins with the departure of Scanlan from the group, whose mental problems and disagreements with the group culminate in an argument that shakes the party. While traveling to Ank'Harel on the continent of Marquet, Vox Machina meet Taryon Darrington, an inexperienced aspiring author and adventurer. Adventuring together with Taryon, some smaller story arcs see Vox Machina helping Keyleth (who seeks to complete her Arament\u00e9), literally traveling to hell, as well as dealing with Taryon's family, who reside in the Dwendalian Empire on the continent of Wildemount. During this arc, which is loosely defined by Scanlan's absence and Taryon's presence in the party, Pike's family also makes an appearance and her relationship with them is explored. The arc includes a one year time skip between episodes 94 and 95.\n\nThe Cult of [[Vecna]] story arc (16 episodes, 100\u2013115) revisits the mysterious and dangerous artifact that was activated beneath Whitestone Castle during the Briarwood story arc. Scanlan finally rejoins Vox Machina, while the party now has to fight a cult which tries to summon the evil [[lich]] demigod Vecna, who seeks to ascend to true godhood and rule Exandria. His ascension actually succeeds and he becomes the only god on this side of the Divine Gate, which keeps the other gods from directly interfering in the world they created. With the indirect help of some of the prime deities who aid them with special powers, Vox Machina are the only group of heroes who can possibly stop the \"Whispered One\" in one gigantic final battle.\n\n====Post-campaign====\nIn 2019, over a year after the first campaign ended, Critical Role produced three canonical one-shot games that feature Vox Machina in the time frame after the banishment of Vecna. The first one-shot, ''Vox Machina: The Search for Grog'', was played at a live show in Los Angeles on January 19, 2019,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://critrole.com/event/live-show-vox-machina-the-search-for-grog/|title=[LIVE SHOW] Vox Machina: The Search for Grog {{!}} Critical Role|date=2018-12-11|language=en-US|access-date=2020-02-23}}</ref> then broadcast on Twitch on February 22, 2019 before being released via YouTube and Twitch VOD on February 23, 2019.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://critrole.com/the-search-for-grog-vod-update/|title=The Search for Grog VOD Update {{!}} Critical Role|date=2019-01-17|language=en-US|access-date=2020-02-23}}</ref> It explored an event that took place in the final episode of Campaign one, but was not played out in detail because it would have disrupted the ongoing epilogue.

It stars Sam Riegel as Taryon Darrington, honorary member of Vox Machina, who leads a group of new characters into their own adventures.

The story is set on the continent of Wildemount, which was briefly visited during the Vox Machina campaign. The Mighty Nein campaign is set about 20 years after Vox Machina's final battle against [[Vecna]]<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/16/16666344/dungeons-and-dragons-twitch-roleplay-rpgs-critical-role-streaming-gaming |title=The rise of D&D liveplay is changing how fans approach roleplaying |work=[[The Verge]] |last=DeVille |first=Chris |date=November 16, 2017 |access-date=December 6, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://geekandsundry.com/critical-role-one-chapter-closes-and-another-begins/ |title=Critical Role: One Chapter Closes, And Another Begins |last=Knox |first=Kelly |publisher=Geek & Sundry |date=December 18, 2017 |access-date=December 23, 2017}}</ref> and takes place in a time where tensions between two of Wildemount\u2019s mightiest nations are very high.\n\nThe Trostenwald/Alfield story arc (episodes 1\u20137) serves as an origin story for the new adventuring party, whose members meet for the first time in a town called Trostenwald within the Dwendalian Empire. They are: Fjord, a male half-orc who gained magical powers out of nowhere; Jester, a young female tiefling who follows an unknown god; Caleb, a very guarded male human wizard; Nott, a seemingly benevolent female goblin; and Beauregard (\"Beau\"), a young human woman \"on a wandering tour\". They meet Mollymauk (\"Molly\"), a pompous tiefling, and Yasha, a quiet swordswoman, who work for a traveling circus. An Undead attack during a circus performance forces the seven to work together, as they have to prove they were not responsible for the incident. During this arc, Beau\u2019s connection to the monk order of the \"Cobalt Soul\", keepers of knowledge who also work as spies, is revealed. The seven individuals decide to travel together, and, after fending off a gnoll attack in the town of Alfield, name themselves \"The Mighty Nein\". \n\nThe Zadash story arc (episodes 8\u201318) covers the party's adventures in the Empire city of Zadash. They do some jobs for the Crownsguard, the official police forces; but also help a secret group that fights corrupt high ranking government officials. During this time, the \"Zauber Spire\", a mage tower in the middle of the city, nearly crumbles in an attack. The group run into one of the attackers, a fleeing Drow. He is later killed by Crownsguard, but the Nein \u2014 unbeknownst to anyone else \u2014 \"acquire\" the mysterious power source he seemingly stole from the mages of the Empire-allied Cerberus Assembly. This event seemingly becomes the catalyst for war between the Dwendalian Empire and the Drow of the Kryn Dynasty, who rule over the eastern country of Xhorhas. Meanwhile, the Mighty Nein start doing jobs for The Gentleman, an enigmatic figure who controls the criminal underground of Zadash. During this time, it is revealed that Molly is missing many of his memories. At the end of this arc, the Nein win Zadash\u2018s annual fighting tournament. At the after-party, they meet Cerberus Assembly archmage Trent Ikithon. Caleb, who was not noticed, later on entrusts the horrible secrets of his past in the service of Ikithon to Nott and Beau - he was once trained to be an Empire assassin. \n\nIn the Labenda Swamp/Iron Shepards story arc (episodes 19\u201331), the Mighty Nein decide to keep away from the beginning war and deal with two missions for the Gentleman. The first one leads them into the Labenda Swamp, where they investigate a smuggler\u2018s safe house that went dark. The party also find a mysterious orb \u2014 which is suddenly sucked into Fjord's body. For their second mission, the party travels to the Empire's northern border, where they are supposed to aid an ally of the Gentleman in the lawless city of Shady Creek Run. On their way, the party are ambushed by a group of slavers known as the \"Iron Shepards\". Fjord, Jester, and Yasha are kidnapped, and a rescue attempt from the rest of the Nein leads to Molly's death at the hands of Lorenzo, the leader of the slavers. Caleb, Beau, and Nott gather new allies \u2014 including Caduceus, the last keeper of a holy graveyard in the forest outside of Shady Creek Run. They attack the Iron Shepards in their stronghold, rescuing their friends and killing the slavers. Following these traumatic events, the group, alongside Caduceus, who wants to accompany them, returns to Zadash. After learning of Molly's fate, a grieving Yasha leaves the party temporarily. \n\nThe False Serpent arc (episodes 32\u201347) follows the Mighty Nein as they travel southwards, out of the Empire and to the city states of the Menagerie Coast. They visit Jester's hometown, the coastal city of Nicodranas, where they meet Jester's mother, Marion Lavorre, a famed courtesan. Surprisingly, they also meet Yasha again, who rejoins the group. Later, an absolutely crazy series of events involving the group, pirates and the city guards leads to the party fleeing by sailing a ship onto the Lucidian Ocean. They embark on a months-long journey, discovering that Fjord's powers \u2014 and the orb \u2014 are granted to him by an ancient and evil being named \"Uk'otoa\", which was sealed away a long time ago. The party is forced into working with the cunning pirate captain Avantika, another one of Uk'otoa's chosen, who plans to release her ancient \"god\". After breaking one of three seals that are holding Uk'otoa back, a rest on Darktow, an island controlled by pirates, gives the Mighty Nein the opportunity to sever their ties with Avantika. She is executed for treason by the \"Plank King\", the leader of the pirates. Fjord, however, continues to follow Uk'otoa's path, breaking the second seal. In the end, he figures out that he does not want to release an evil calamity, and abandons the search for the third seal. Back in Nicodranas, the Nein meet Yussah Erennis, a strange elven mage, who they entrust with a weird magical item they had found. Then, the Mighty Nein return to the Empire, where the city of Felderwin was attacked by Kryn.\n\nIn the Xhorhas story arc (episodes 48\u201369), the Mighty Nein travel east and have to deal with the reality of the war. In Felderwin, they learn that a Halfling named Yeza was taken by the Kryn, which leads Nott to confess that she is a Halfling who was magically changed into a Goblin. She's also married to Yeza, with whom she has a son, Luc. Searching for Yeza, the group travels into the wastelands of Xhorhas. In the city of Asarius, they take on mercenary work for the Kryn, sealing a strange rift to the Abyss, the demonic plane. As their reward, the group are granted an audience with Leylas Kryn, the Bright Queen, ruler of the Kryn Dynasty. During the audience in the capital, Rosohna, the party are accused of espionage. In an effort to save their lives, Caleb hands over the object the party \"acquired\" in Zadash. It turns out to be one of the \"Beacons of the Luxon\", key parts of the Kryn's religion that were stolen by the Cerberus Assembly \u2013 a reason for the war. The Mighty Nein are declared heroes, and Yeza and Nott are reunited. Following this, the party find more demonic rifts they manage to seal. The Kryn reward them with a house in Rosohna. During this time, Yasha tells the whole group about her own dark past \u2013 parts of which she doesn\u2019t remember. Also, Beau has to deal with her mentor Dairon, who has infiltrated Xhorhas for the Cobalt Soul. Over time, the Mighty Nein figure out that the rifts were opened on purpose. They chase the responsible person, Obann, to a place called Bazzoxan, where he lures them into an ancient underground temple. Here, Obann reveals himself as a demon and releases an ancient, mad terror known as the \"Laughing Hand\". Also, Yasha seemingly turns on the party. She had, in the past of which she was missing memories, served under Obann in the cult of a being called the \"Angel of Irons\". The others barely escape with their lives, unaware that Yasha was controlled by Obann. \n\nThe Angel of Irons story arc (episode 70\u201386) follows the remaining party members after Bazzoxan. They reunite Yeza and Luc, escorting them to live with Marion Lavorre in Nicodranas. Searching for more power to beat the Laughing Hand, the Mighty Nein travel to the \"Greying Wildlands\", north of the Empire and Xhorhas, where they hope to reforge an ancient sword known as the \"Star Razor\". With help from the Dust family, keepers of a holy kiln, as well as from a smith and a vigilante from the city of Uthodorn, the reforging process is a success. However, during their travels, the Nein only narrowly escape from an encounter with the ancient white dragon Gelidon \u2013 and during this time, Uk'otoa takes away Fjord's magical powers because he disobeyed his patron. Fjord manages to destroy his pact weapon, and, with guidance from Caduceus, becomes a Paladin of the Cleric's goddess, the Wildmother. He now wields Star Razor. During this arc, Beau is promoted within the Cobalt Soul order. The group \u2014 via Jester's Scrying spell \u2014 witness an attack on the Cobalt Soul library in Zadash, carried out by Obann, Yasha, and the Laughing Hand. They manage to deduce their next goal, but come up short again when Obann manages to release another ancient terror, the \"Caedogeist\". Seeking guidance, the Mighty Nein visit the mage Yussah, who has vanished into the age-old \u201eHeirloom Sphere\u201c, the magical object the Mighty Nein had left with him. The Nein, supported by Yussah\u2019s ally Allura Vysoren, follow and free him while also finding a way to weaken the Laughing Hand. After this, a ritual reveals the true face of the Angel of Irons: Tharizdun, the Chained Oblivion, the maddest and oldest darkness trying to break its shackles. Under the Empire's capital, Rexxentrum, the Mighty Nein confront the \"Angel\" cult for the final time \u2013 all while Kryn forces attack the city. They break Obann's influence over Yasha, who obliterates her abuser shortly after, and kill the Laughing Hand, while the Caedogeist turns on Obann and flees. \n\nThe current story arc (ongoing from Episode 87) starts with the Mighty Nein being brought before King Bertrand Dwendal and his advisors, including Cerberus Assembly members Ludinus Da'leth and Trent Ikithon. They convince the King that they stopped a dangerous cult, but have to admit they have contacts in the Dynasty. However, the King and the Assembly want the Nein to help broker a peace, using the second stolen Beacon as a peace offering. At this time, Ikithon reveals that he has recognised Caleb as his former student, Bren. Caleb also has to confront two other students of Trent: his former friends Eodwulf and Astrid. Beau discovers that the Assembly has found yet another Beacon that the Dynasty doesn\u2019t know about \u2013 giving them the opportunity to end the war and keep a Beacon. The party convince the Bright Queen to hold peace talks on neutral ground without mentioning this detail. During the preparations for the talks, the Mighty Nein deal with some of their private problems. Caleb and Essek, a gifted mage and their friend from the Dynasty, create a spell that can turn Nott back into a Halfing. The spell fails - because Nott was not only turned, but cursed. The search for the magic woman who did this to Nott leads the Nein to someone who Beau\u2019s father once made a deal with: Isharnai, a crone-like being. The Nein visit Beau's parents, with whom she\u2019s had a bad falling out \u2013 their reunion sends Beau in a mental downward spiral. The subsequent meeting with Isharnai is saved by Jester, who masterfully tricks Isharnai into lifting Nott's curse. This triggers a revelation from the Traveler, Jester's enigmatic god: He is actually not a god, but an archfey named Artagan - who has become something more thanks to Jester's belief. The Nein also help Caduceus on his path, as he finds a possibility to help his dying forest home and reunites with his family \u2013 who were turned to stone on the last leg of their own journeys, a curse that is broken by the party.

A one-shot could be described as the RPG equivalent to a [[short story]].\n\nSome of the ''Critical Role'' one-shots are canonical parts of the storylines that play out in one of the campaigns, covering events that occur outside the time frame of the respective campaign, but still feature some of the campaign's main characters. Other one-shots only have a tangential relationship to the campaigns, as they are set in the world of Exandria, but feature a different cast of characters, often in smaller scale adventures that may or may not be canon. There are also one-shots that have no connection with the campaigns or the world of Exandria at all.<ref>e.g. \n*{{cite web |title=Critical Role \u2013 Liam's Quest: Full Circle |url=https://geekandsundry.com/critical-role-liams-quest-full-circle/ |publisher=[[Geek & Sundry]] |accessdate=July 18, 2018 |date=April 24, 2017}} - where O'Brien was Dungeon Master for a one-shot separate from the ''Critical Role'' fictional Universe.\n*{{cite web |title=Critical Role: Bar Room Blitz \u2013 A Sam Riegel One-Shot |url=https://geekandsundry.com/critical-role-bar-room-blitz/ |publisher=[[Geek & Sundry]] |accessdate=July 18, 2018 |date=September 4, 2017}} - in which Riegel is Dungeon Master with O'Brien and several guests playing. This story is set within Exandria.</ref> Especially for the latter two types of one-shots, it is not uncommon that several guest players replace absent cast members.\n\n''Critical Role'' aired several one-shots in the hiatus between Campaign one and Campaign two. Also, during the runtime of a campaign, the series will occasionally air (sometimes prerecorded) one-shots as replacements for regular episodes, for example on Thursdays on which multiple cast members are unavailable due to other work commitments. Sometimes one-shots are aired as additional content, for example as rewards for the fans donating money to a charity the cast promoted. Not all ''Critical Role'' one-shots use the ''Dungeons & Dragons'' game system, as some are based on different, sometimes one-page, RPG games. Also, in many one-shots, other cast members take over the role of Dungeon Master or [[Gamemaster|game master]] (GM) from Matthew Mercer. {{As of|2019|10}}, over 25 one-shots have aired, and every cast member\u2014with the exception of Ashley Johnson\u2014has taken up the duties of DMing or GMing at least once.\n\nSome of ''Critical Role'''s one shots have been sponsored. One-shot sponsors have included ''[[Middle-earth: Shadow of War]]'', ''[[Hearthstone]]'', and ''[[Call of Cthulhu (role-playing game)|Call of Cthulhu]]''. In 2019, a Critical Role one-shot was sponsored by [[Wendy's]] to promote the ''Feast of Legends'' RPG system<ref name=\"WC2019-Wendy\">{{cite news |last1=Williamson |first1=Evan |title=Wendy\u2019s expands its focus beyond food |url=https://westerncourier.com/45614/the-edge/wendys-expands-its-focus-beyond-food/ |accessdate=October 23, 2019 |work=Western Courier |date=October 14, 2019}}</ref> developed by the company. However, following a strong negative fan response to the sponsor, the Critical Role team chose to take down the VOD,<ref name=\"WC2019-Wendy\" /> announcing via Twitter that they had donated their sponsorship profits from the one-shot to the Farm Worker Justice organization.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Role |first1=Critical |title=We\u2019ve donated our profits from our sponsorships this week to @FarmwrkrJustice, an organization that works to improve the lives of farmworkers. |url=https://twitter.com/CriticalRole/status/1180219441247703040 |website=@CriticalRole |accessdate=October 23, 2019 |language=en |date=October 4, 2019}}</ref>\n\n====''Talks Machina''====\n''Talks Machina'' airs live on Critical Role's Twitch channel at 18:45&nbsp;PT on the Tuesday following each new ''Critical Role'' episode.

On each ''Talks Machina'' episode, Foster and a few (usually two) cast members discuss the most recent installment of ''Critical Role''. A few days before a new episode of ''Talks Machina'', the cast members who will be present as guests on the respective episode are announced, and fans can submit questions which they want these cast members to answer. Some questions are picked out by the ''Talks Machina'' crew and answered on-air by the cast, allowing the fans to gain some more insight on in-game events, decisions, or character development.\n\n''Talks Machina'' also runs weekly competitions for fan content, such as \"fan art of the week\" and \"cosplay of the week\". The winners are announced in special segments that act as interludes during the show. Prizes for the winners of these competitions include ''Critical Role'' merchandise, Wyrmwood products, or special merchandise from the respective episode's sponsor.\n\nOriginally, the first 100 episodes of ''Talks Machina'' were broadcast on Geek & Sundry's channels. Beginning in February 2019, and coinciding with Critical Role's split from Geek & Sundry, new episodes began airing on the ''Critical Role'' Twitch channel. The VODs are available to Twitch subscribers immediately after the initial broadcast, and are also uploaded to YouTube on the following Thursday. Beginning in December 2019, as part of the migration of older content to the ''Critical Role'' channels, some episodes of Talks Machina were deleted from Geek & Sundry's channels and re-uploaded to the official ''Critical Role'' channels. All episodes can be accessed via playlists provided on ''Critical Role'''s website and YouTube channel.\n\n====''Critical Recap''====\nHosted by Critical Role production coordinator Dani Carr, ''Critical Recap'' is a short video series that quickly summarizes the events of the previous week's episode of ''Critical Role''.<ref name=\"CritRecap\">{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDrGA0fPDig |title=Critical Recap: Campaign 2, Episodes 1 - 10 -- The Story So Far |publisher=Geek & Sundry |website=Youtube.com |last=Carr |first=Dani |date=March 22, 2018 |accessdate=February 3, 2019}}</ref> Starting with Episode 11 of Campaign two, ''Critical Recap'' aired on the Geek & Sundry Twitch channel before the ''Critical Role'' live stream on Thursdays.

The studio has produced ''Critical Role'' and ''Talks Machina'' since 2018. It also develops and produces other programming for the studio's Twitch and YouTube channels.\n\n==Campaign structure==\nThe ''Critical Role'' storyline occurs in a [[Campaign (role-playing games)|campaign]] that consists of a series of story arcs, which are usually played over multiple episodes. Between\u2014or sometimes within\u2014the major story arcs, the characters rest, resupply, or go on side quests. In addition, every player character has a [[backstory]], an unfinished part of their personal history that can be relevant to the campaign from time to time. Sometimes, major story arcs are intrinsically tied to a character's backstory.\n\nBoth campaigns are set in Exandria, a world of Matthew Mercer's creation.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/toddkenreck/2017/06/06/matthew-mercer-on-critical-roles-taldorei-campaign-setting-guide/ |title=Matthew Mercer On Critical Role's Tal'Dorei Campaign Setting Guide |work=[[Forbes]] |last=Kenreck |first=Todd |date=June 6, 2017 |accessdate=May 12, 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Campaign one===\nCampaign one [[Campaign setting|takes place]] primarily in Tal'Dorei, a continent of Exandria. It follows the exploits of an adventuring party known as '''Vox Machina''', previously known as the Super High-Intensity Team (or S.H.I.T.s), a rag-tag group of mercenaries originally formed in the swamp-town of Stilben.\n\n====Pre-series history====\nIn their adventures prior to the start of the series, the group saved the family of Sovereign Uriel Tal'Dorei III, ruler of Tal'Dorei and its capital city of Emon. In appreciation, Uriel gave the group seats on the city [[council]], and provided them with a residence called Greyskull Keep, which is located just outside the city. Episode 36, titled ''Winter's Crest in Whitestone'', features a summary of the pre-series history (starting 1 hour 35 minutes into the episode), with artwork created by Wendy Sullivan Green and voice-overs provided by the cast.<ref>{{cite AV media |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EikRMYRf5-Y&t=96m21s |title=Winter's Crest in Whitestone : Critical Role RPG Show Episode 36 - The Story of Vox Machina |publisher=Geek & Sundry |date=December 18, 2015 |medium=Youtube video |time=1:36:21 |access-date=May 20, 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe forthcoming ''Critical Role'' animated series will include a canonic story that takes place within the pre-stream time frame.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/criticalrole/critical-role-the-legend-of-vox-machina-animated-s/description |title=Critical Role: The Legend of Vox Machina Animated Special |website=Kickstarter |accessdate=May 9, 2019 |quote=\"... the first few episodes of our animation will focus on a brand new Vox Machina adventure, which takes place before our show began streaming live on Twitch.\"}}</ref>\n\n====On-stream campaign====\nThe first episode of the show aired on March 12, 2015, beginning the on-stream part of the first campaign, which concluded with its 115th and final episode on October 12, 2017.<ref name=\"bleedingcool\"/><ref>{{cite tweet |number=920015612184686592 |title=The end. |user=CriticalRole |author=Critical Role |date=October 16, 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe Kraghammer story arc (16 episodes, 1\u201316) jumps in at the point in Vox Machina's story where the cast's original home game left off. It takes place primarily in the subterrenean depths of the [[Underdark]], and culminates in a battle between Vox Machina and a dangerous [[Beholder (Dungeons & Dragons)|beholder]] by the name of K'varn, who is controlling an entire city of [[Illithid]].\n\nThe Vasselheim story arc (7 episodes, 17\u201323) splits the party into two groups, who seek to prove their worth to the \"Slayer's Take\", a local adventurer's guild in the ancient city of Vasselheim, by taking on dangerous missions. This arc features multi-episode [[guest appearance]]s by [[Felicia Day]] (Lyra), [[Mary Elizabeth McGlynn]] (Zahra), [[Wil Wheaton]] (Thorbir), and [[Will Friedle]] (Kashaw), adding a new twist to the now-divided adventuring band. This arc also includes the first episode (episode 22) that touches on a character's backstory, as Keyleth visits another druid tribe to continue her Arament\u00e9, a journey to become the leader of her people.\n\nThe Briarwood story arc (15 episodes, 24\u201338) leads Vox Machina to Percy's ancestral home, the city of Whitestone, which was once ruled by his family. The party have to fight for control over Whitestone against Lord and Lady Briarwood, who are responsible for the demise of most of the de Rolo family and have taken the city as their own. The Briarwood's ties into necromancy and a secret cult make things even more dangerous, and Vox Machina must stop them from completing a ritual that threatens to endanger the entire kingdom. During the early stages of this arc, Tiberius leaves Vox Machina for good.\n\nThe Chroma Conclave story arc (45 episodes, 39\u201383) begins with the attack of four ancient [[chromatic dragon]]s on Emon, the capital of Tal'Dorei, with the Sovereign and other important political figures falling in the onslaught. The dragons take control over and divide the kingdom, and in order to defeat them, Vox Machina needs more power than they currently have. They search for the \"Vestiges of Divergence\", famed and extremely powerful magical items from ages passed, which are scattered throughout the world. During the ongoing battles against the powerful dragons of the Chroma Conclave, the backstories of some characters are also further explored. Smaller arcs focus on Grog's herd that once exiled him, the last figure from Percy's traumatic past, as well as a strained family reunion for the twins, Vex and Vax.\n\nThe Taryon Darrington story arc (16 episodes, 84\u201399) begins with the departure of Scanlan from the group, whose mental problems and disagreements with the group culminate in an argument that shakes the party. While traveling to Ank'Harel on the continent of Marquet, Vox Machina meet Taryon Darrington, an inexperienced aspiring author and adventurer. Adventuring together with Taryon, some smaller story arcs see Vox Machina helping Keyleth (who seeks to complete her Arament\u00e9), literally traveling to hell, as well as dealing with Taryon's family, who reside in the Dwendalian Empire on the continent of Wildemount. During this arc, which is loosely defined by Scanlan's absence and Taryon's presence in the party, Pike's family also makes an appearance and her relationship with them is explored. The arc includes a one year time skip between episodes 94 and 95.\n\nThe Cult of [[Vecna]] story arc (16 episodes, 100\u2013115) revisits the mysterious and dangerous artifact that was activated beneath Whitestone Castle during the Briarwood story arc. Scanlan finally rejoins Vox Machina, while the party now has to fight a cult which tries to summon the evil [[lich]] demigod Vecna, who seeks to ascend to true godhood and rule Exandria. His ascension actually succeeds and he becomes the only god on this side of the Divine Gate, which keeps the other gods from directly interfering in the world they created. With the indirect help of some of the prime deities who aid them with special powers, Vox Machina are the only group of heroes who can possibly stop the \"Whispered One\" in one gigantic final battle.\n\n====Post-campaign====\nIn 2019, over a year after the first campaign ended, Critical Role produced three canonical one-shot games that feature Vox Machina in the time frame after the banishment of Vecna. The first one-shot, ''Vox Machina: The Search for Grog'', was played at a live show in Los Angeles on January 19, 2019,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://critrole.com/event/live-show-vox-machina-the-search-for-grog/|title=[LIVE SHOW] Vox Machina: The Search for Grog {{!}} Critical Role|date=2018-12-11|language=en-US|access-date=2020-02-23}}</ref> then broadcast on Twitch on February 22, 2019 before being released via YouTube and Twitch VOD on February 23, 2019.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://critrole.com/the-search-for-grog-vod-update/|title=The Search for Grog VOD Update {{!}} Critical Role|date=2019-01-17|language=en-US|access-date=2020-02-23}}</ref> It explored an event that took place in the final episode of Campaign one, but was not played out in detail because it would have disrupted the ongoing epilogue.

It stars Sam Riegel as Taryon Darrington, honorary member of Vox Machina, who leads a group of new characters into their own adventures.

The story is set on the continent of Wildemount, which was briefly visited during the Vox Machina campaign. The Mighty Nein campaign is set about 20 years after Vox Machina's final battle against [[Vecna]]<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/16/16666344/dungeons-and-dragons-twitch-roleplay-rpgs-critical-role-streaming-gaming |title=The rise of D&D liveplay is changing how fans approach roleplaying |work=[[The Verge]] |last=DeVille |first=Chris |date=November 16, 2017 |access-date=December 6, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://geekandsundry.com/critical-role-one-chapter-closes-and-another-begins/ |title=Critical Role: One Chapter Closes, And Another Begins |last=Knox |first=Kelly |publisher=Geek & Sundry |date=December 18, 2017 |access-date=December 23, 2017}}</ref> and takes place in a time where tensions between two of Wildemount\u2019s mightiest nations are very high.\n\nThe Trostenwald/Alfield story arc (episodes 1\u20137) serves as an origin story for the new adventuring party, whose members meet for the first time in a town called Trostenwald within the Dwendalian Empire. They are: Fjord, a male half-orc who gained magical powers out of nowhere; Jester, a young female tiefling who follows an unknown god; Caleb, a very guarded male human wizard; Nott, a seemingly benevolent female goblin; and Beauregard (\"Beau\"), a young human woman \"on a wandering tour\". They meet Mollymauk (\"Molly\"), a pompous tiefling, and Yasha, a quiet swordswoman, who work for a traveling circus. An Undead attack during a circus performance forces the seven to work together, as they have to prove they were not responsible for the incident. During this arc, Beau\u2019s connection to the monk order of the \"Cobalt Soul\", keepers of knowledge who also work as spies, is revealed. The seven individuals decide to travel together, and, after fending off a gnoll attack in the town of Alfield, name themselves \"The Mighty Nein\". \n\nThe Zadash story arc (episodes 8\u201318) covers the party's adventures in the Empire city of Zadash. They do some jobs for the Crownsguard, the official police forces; but also help a secret group that fights corrupt high ranking government officials. During this time, the \"Zauber Spire\", a mage tower in the middle of the city, nearly crumbles in an attack. The group run into one of the attackers, a fleeing Drow. He is later killed by Crownsguard, but the Nein \u2014 unbeknownst to anyone else \u2014 \"acquire\" the mysterious power source he seemingly stole from the mages of the Empire-allied Cerberus Assembly. This event seemingly becomes the catalyst for war between the Dwendalian Empire and the Drow of the Kryn Dynasty, who rule over the eastern country of Xhorhas. Meanwhile, the Mighty Nein start doing jobs for The Gentleman, an enigmatic figure who controls the criminal underground of Zadash. During this time, it is revealed that Molly is missing many of his memories. At the end of this arc, the Nein win Zadash\u2018s annual fighting tournament. At the after-party, they meet Cerberus Assembly archmage Trent Ikithon. Caleb, who was not noticed, later on entrusts the horrible secrets of his past in the service of Ikithon to Nott and Beau - he was once trained to be an Empire assassin. \n\nIn the Labenda Swamp/Iron Shepards story arc (episodes 19\u201331), the Mighty Nein decide to keep away from the beginning war and deal with two missions for the Gentleman. The first one leads them into the Labenda Swamp, where they investigate a smuggler\u2018s safe house that went dark. The party also find a mysterious orb \u2014 which is suddenly sucked into Fjord's body. For their second mission, the party travels to the Empire's northern border, where they are supposed to aid an ally of the Gentleman in the lawless city of Shady Creek Run. On their way, the party are ambushed by a group of slavers known as the \"Iron Shepards\". Fjord, Jester, and Yasha are kidnapped, and a rescue attempt from the rest of the Nein leads to Molly's death at the hands of Lorenzo, the leader of the slavers. Caleb, Beau, and Nott gather new allies \u2014 including Caduceus, the last keeper of a holy graveyard in the forest outside of Shady Creek Run. They attack the Iron Shepards in their stronghold, rescuing their friends and killing the slavers. Following these traumatic events, the group, alongside Caduceus, who wants to accompany them, returns to Zadash. After learning of Molly's fate, a grieving Yasha leaves the party temporarily. \n\nThe False Serpent arc (episodes 32\u201347) follows the Mighty Nein as they travel southwards, out of the Empire and to the city states of the Menagerie Coast. They visit Jester's hometown, the coastal city of Nicodranas, where they meet Jester's mother, Marion Lavorre, a famed courtesan. Surprisingly, they also meet Yasha again, who rejoins the group. Later, an absolutely crazy series of events involving the group, pirates and the city guards leads to the party fleeing by sailing a ship onto the Lucidian Ocean. They embark on a months-long journey, discovering that Fjord's powers \u2014 and the orb \u2014 are granted to him by an ancient and evil being named \"Uk'otoa\", which was sealed away a long time ago. The party is forced into working with the cunning pirate captain Avantika, another one of Uk'otoa's chosen, who plans to release her ancient \"god\". After breaking one of three seals that are holding Uk'otoa back, a rest on Darktow, an island controlled by pirates, gives the Mighty Nein the opportunity to sever their ties with Avantika. She is executed for treason by the \"Plank King\", the leader of the pirates. Fjord, however, continues to follow Uk'otoa's path, breaking the second seal. In the end, he figures out that he does not want to release an evil calamity, and abandons the search for the third seal. Back in Nicodranas, the Nein meet Yussah Erennis, a strange elven mage, who they entrust with a weird magical item they had found. Then, the Mighty Nein return to the Empire, where the city of Felderwin was attacked by Kryn.\n\nIn the Xhorhas story arc (episodes 48\u201369), the Mighty Nein travel east and have to deal with the reality of the war. In Felderwin, they learn that a Halfling named Yeza was taken by the Kryn, which leads Nott to confess that she is a Halfling who was magically changed into a Goblin. She's also married to Yeza, with whom she has a son, Luc. Searching for Yeza, the group travels into the wastelands of Xhorhas. In the city of Asarius, they take on mercenary work for the Kryn, sealing a strange rift to the Abyss, the demonic plane. As their reward, the group are granted an audience with Leylas Kryn, the Bright Queen, ruler of the Kryn Dynasty. During the audience in the capital, Rosohna, the party are accused of espionage. In an effort to save their lives, Caleb hands over the object the party \"acquired\" in Zadash. It turns out to be one of the \"Beacons of the Luxon\", key parts of the Kryn's religion that were stolen by the Cerberus Assembly \u2013 a reason for the war. The Mighty Nein are declared heroes, and Yeza and Nott are reunited. Following this, the party find more demonic rifts they manage to seal. The Kryn reward them with a house in Rosohna. During this time, Yasha tells the whole group about her own dark past \u2013 parts of which she doesn\u2019t remember. Also, Beau has to deal with her mentor Dairon, who has infiltrated Xhorhas for the Cobalt Soul. Over time, the Mighty Nein figure out that the rifts were opened on purpose. They chase the responsible person, Obann, to a place called Bazzoxan, where he lures them into an ancient underground temple. Here, Obann reveals himself as a demon and releases an ancient, mad terror known as the \"Laughing Hand\". Also, Yasha seemingly turns on the party. She had, in the past of which she was missing memories, served under Obann in the cult of a being called the \"Angel of Irons\". The others barely escape with their lives, unaware that Yasha was controlled by Obann. \n\nThe Angel of Irons story arc (episode 70\u201386) follows the remaining party members after Bazzoxan. They reunite Yeza and Luc, escorting them to live with Marion Lavorre in Nicodranas. Searching for more power to beat the Laughing Hand, the Mighty Nein travel to the \"Greying Wildlands\", north of the Empire and Xhorhas, where they hope to reforge an ancient sword known as the \"Star Razor\". With help from the Dust family, keepers of a holy kiln, as well as from a smith and a vigilante from the city of Uthodorn, the reforging process is a success. However, during their travels, the Nein only narrowly escape from an encounter with the ancient white dragon Gelidon \u2013 and during this time, Uk'otoa takes away Fjord's magical powers because he disobeyed his patron. Fjord manages to destroy his pact weapon, and, with guidance from Caduceus, becomes a Paladin of the Cleric's goddess, the Wildmother. He now wields Star Razor. During this arc, Beau is promoted within the Cobalt Soul order. The group \u2014 via Jester's Scrying spell \u2014 witness an attack on the Cobalt Soul library in Zadash, carried out by Obann, Yasha, and the Laughing Hand. They manage to deduce their next goal, but come up short again when Obann manages to release another ancient terror, the \"Caedogeist\". Seeking guidance, the Mighty Nein visit the mage Yussah, who has vanished into the age-old \u201eHeirloom Sphere\u201c, the magical object the Mighty Nein had left with him. The Nein, supported by Yussah\u2019s ally Allura Vysoren, follow and free him while also finding a way to weaken the Laughing Hand. After this, a ritual reveals the true face of the Angel of Irons: Tharizdun, the Chained Oblivion, the maddest and oldest darkness trying to break its shackles. Under the Empire's capital, Rexxentrum, the Mighty Nein confront the \"Angel\" cult for the final time \u2013 all while Kryn forces attack the city. They break Obann's influence over Yasha, who obliterates her abuser shortly after, and kill the Laughing Hand, while the Caedogeist turns on Obann and flees. \n\nThe current story arc (ongoing from Episode 87) starts with the Mighty Nein being brought before King Bertrand Dwendal and his advisors, including Cerberus Assembly members Ludinus Da'leth and Trent Ikithon. They convince the King that they stopped a dangerous cult, but have to admit they have contacts in the Dynasty. However, the King and the Assembly want the Nein to help broker a peace, using the second stolen Beacon as a peace offering. At this time, Ikithon reveals that he has recognised Caleb as his former student, Bren. Caleb also has to confront two other students of Trent: his former friends Eodwulf and Astrid. Beau discovers that the Assembly has found yet another Beacon that the Dynasty doesn\u2019t know about \u2013 giving them the opportunity to end the war and keep a Beacon. The party convince the Bright Queen to hold peace talks on neutral ground without mentioning this detail. During the preparations for the talks, the Mighty Nein deal with some of their private problems. Caleb and Essek, a gifted mage and their friend from the Dynasty, create a spell that can turn Nott back into a Halfing. The spell fails - because Nott was not only turned, but cursed. The search for the magic woman who did this to Nott leads the Nein to someone who Beau\u2019s father once made a deal with: Isharnai, a crone-like being. The Nein visit Beau's parents, with whom she\u2019s had a bad falling out \u2013 their reunion sends Beau in a mental downward spiral. The subsequent meeting with Isharnai is saved by Jester, who masterfully tricks Isharnai into lifting Nott's curse. This triggers a revelation from the Traveler, Jester's enigmatic god: He is actually not a god, but an archfey named Artagan - who has become something more thanks to Jester's belief. The Nein also help Caduceus on his path, as he finds a possibility to help his dying forest home and reunites with his family \u2013 who were turned to stone on the last leg of their own journeys, a curse that is broken by the party. Caduceus' family returns home, and soon after, the spell on Nott works. She becomes herself again: Veth, a Halfling. With the peace talks approaching, both Caduceus and Veth agree to travel with the Nein for a little longer.\n\n==Cast and characters==\n{{As of|since=y|2015|10|post=,}} ''Critical Role'' has consisted of eight main cast members, all of whom are the original cast.

A one-shot could be described as the RPG equivalent to a [[short story]].\n\nSome of the ''Critical Role'' one-shots are canonical parts of the storylines that play out in one of the campaigns, covering events that occur outside the time frame of the respective campaign, but still feature some of the campaign's main characters. Other one-shots only have a tangential relationship to the campaigns, as they are set in the world of Exandria, but feature a different cast of characters, often in smaller scale adventures that may or may not be canon. There are also one-shots that have no connection with the campaigns or the world of Exandria at all.<ref>e.g. \n*{{cite web |title=Critical Role \u2013 Liam's Quest: Full Circle |url=https://geekandsundry.com/critical-role-liams-quest-full-circle/ |publisher=[[Geek & Sundry]] |accessdate=July 18, 2018 |date=April 24, 2017}} - where O'Brien was Dungeon Master for a one-shot separate from the ''Critical Role'' fictional Universe.\n*{{cite web |title=Critical Role: Bar Room Blitz \u2013 A Sam Riegel One-Shot |url=https://geekandsundry.com/critical-role-bar-room-blitz/ |publisher=[[Geek & Sundry]] |accessdate=July 18, 2018 |date=September 4, 2017}} - in which Riegel is Dungeon Master with O'Brien and several guests playing. This story is set within Exandria.</ref> Especially for the latter two types of one-shots, it is not uncommon that several guest players replace absent cast members.\n\n''Critical Role'' aired several one-shots in the hiatus between Campaign one and Campaign two. Also, during the runtime of a campaign, the series will occasionally air (sometimes prerecorded) one-shots as replacements for regular episodes, for example on Thursdays on which multiple cast members are unavailable due to other work commitments. Sometimes one-shots are aired as additional content, for example as rewards for the fans donating money to a charity the cast promoted. Not all ''Critical Role'' one-shots use the ''Dungeons & Dragons'' game system, as some are based on different, sometimes one-page, RPG games. Also, in many one-shots, other cast members take over the role of Dungeon Master or [[Gamemaster|game master]] (GM) from Matthew Mercer. {{As of|2019|10}}, over 25 one-shots have aired, and every cast member\u2014with the exception of Ashley Johnson\u2014has taken up the duties of DMing or GMing at least once.\n\nSome of ''Critical Role'''s one shots have been sponsored. One-shot sponsors have included ''[[Middle-earth: Shadow of War]]'', ''[[Hearthstone]]'', and ''[[Call of Cthulhu (role-playing game)|Call of Cthulhu]]''. In 2019, a Critical Role one-shot was sponsored by [[Wendy's]] to promote the ''Feast of Legends'' RPG system<ref name=\"WC2019-Wendy\">{{cite news |last1=Williamson |first1=Evan |title=Wendy\u2019s expands its focus beyond food |url=https://westerncourier.com/45614/the-edge/wendys-expands-its-focus-beyond-food/ |accessdate=October 23, 2019 |work=Western Courier |date=October 14, 2019}}</ref> developed by the company. However, following a strong negative fan response to the sponsor, the Critical Role team chose to take down the VOD,<ref name=\"WC2019-Wendy\" /> announcing via Twitter that they had donated their sponsorship profits from the one-shot to the Farm Worker Justice organization.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Role |first1=Critical |title=We\u2019ve donated our profits from our sponsorships this week to @FarmwrkrJustice, an organization that works to improve the lives of farmworkers. |url=https://twitter.com/CriticalRole/status/1180219441247703040 |website=@CriticalRole |accessdate=October 23, 2019 |language=en |date=October 4, 2019}}</ref>\n\n====''Talks Machina''====\n''Talks Machina'' airs live on Critical Role's Twitch channel at 18:45&nbsp;PT on the Tuesday following each new ''Critical Role'' episode.

On each ''Talks Machina'' episode, Foster and a few (usually two) cast members discuss the most recent installment of ''Critical Role''. A few days before a new episode of ''Talks Machina'', the cast members who will be present as guests on the respective episode are announced, and fans can submit questions which they want these cast members to answer. Some questions are picked out by the ''Talks Machina'' crew and answered on-air by the cast, allowing the fans to gain some more insight on in-game events, decisions, or character development.\n\n''Talks Machina'' also runs weekly competitions for fan content, such as \"fan art of the week\" and \"cosplay of the week\". The winners are announced in special segments that act as interludes during the show. Prizes for the winners of these competitions include ''Critical Role'' merchandise, Wyrmwood products, or special merchandise from the respective episode's sponsor.\n\nOriginally, the first 100 episodes of ''Talks Machina'' were broadcast on Geek & Sundry's channels. Beginning in February 2019, and coinciding with Critical Role's split from Geek & Sundry, new episodes began airing on the ''Critical Role'' Twitch channel. The VODs are available to Twitch subscribers immediately after the initial broadcast, and are also uploaded to YouTube on the following Thursday. Beginning in December 2019, as part of the migration of older content to the ''Critical Role'' channels, some episodes of Talks Machina were deleted from Geek & Sundry's channels and re-uploaded to the official ''Critical Role'' channels. All episodes can be accessed via playlists provided on ''Critical Role'''s website and YouTube channel.\n\n====''Critical Recap''====\nHosted by Critical Role production coordinator Dani Carr, ''Critical Recap'' is a short video series that quickly summarizes the events of the previous week's episode of ''Critical Role''.<ref name=\"CritRecap\">{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDrGA0fPDig |title=Critical Recap: Campaign 2, Episodes 1 - 10 -- The Story So Far |publisher=Geek & Sundry |website=Youtube.com |last=Carr |first=Dani |date=March 22, 2018 |accessdate=February 3, 2019}}</ref> Starting with Episode 11 of Campaign two, ''Critical Recap'' aired on the Geek & Sundry Twitch channel before the ''Critical Role'' live stream on Thursdays.

Studies during the early 21st Century have shown that the main prey taken is small pelagic baitfish. It is though that this shift is a result of long term changes in the [[East Australian Current]] which brings warmer waters from the [[Coral Sea]] and has extended farther south since the 1990s. It is further thought that his \u201cmulti-decadal southward penetration of the EAC\u201d is one of the more obvious indications of [[global warming]] and the recorded change in the diet of ''A trutta'' forms a biological record of global warming.<ref name = Dubbins>{{cite web | url = https://www.fishingworld.com.au/news/fish-facts-australian-salmon | title = Fish Facts: Australian salmon | author = Dr Ben Diggles | date = 14 September 2016 | accessdate = 21 April 2020 | publisher = Fishing World}}</ref>  \n\n''Arripis trutta'' are preyed on by larger apex predators such as seals, dolphins and sharks.

It is though that this shift is a result of long term changes in the [[East Australian Current]] which brings warmer waters from the [[Coral Sea]] and has extended farther south since the 1990s. It is further thought that his \u201cmulti-decadal southward penetration of the EAC\u201d is one of the more obvious indications of [[global warming]] and the recorded change in the diet of ''A trutta'' forms a biological record of global warming.<ref name = Dubbins>{{cite web | url = https://www.fishingworld.com.au/news/fish-facts-australian-salmon | title = Fish Facts: Australian salmon | author = Dr Ben Diggles | date = 14 September 2016 | accessdate = 21 April 2020 | publisher = Fishing World}}</ref>  \n\n''Arripis trutta'' are preyed on by larger apex predators such as seals, dolphins and sharks.

It also owned a large portion of inland Canada. The company established the [[Jamestown, Virginia|Jamestown Settlement]] on May 14, 1607 about 40 miles inland along the [[James River (Virginia)|James River]], a major tributary of the [[Chesapeake Bay]] in [[Virginia]]. In 1620, [[George Calvert]] asked King James I for a charter for English Catholics to add the territory of the Plymouth Company. Also in 1609, a much larger [[Third Supply]] mission was organized. A new purpose-built ship named the ''[[Sea Venture]]'' was rushed into service without the customary sea trials. She became flagship of a fleet of nine ships, with most of the leaders, food, and supplies aboard. Aboard the ''Sea Venture'' were fleet Admiral [[George Somers]], Vice-Admiral [[Christopher Newport]], Virginia Colony governor Sir [[Thomas Gates (governor)|Thomas Gates]], [[William Strachey]], and businessman [[John Rolfe]] with his pregnant wife.\n\nThe Third Supply convoy encountered a hurricane which lasted three days and separated the ships from one another. The ''Sea Venture'' was leaking through its new caulking, and Admiral Somers had it driven aground on a reef to avoid sinking, saving 150 men and women but destroying the ship.<ref>Woodward, Hobson.

At Jamestown, they found that more than 85-percent of the 500 colonists had perished during the [[Starving Time (Jamestown)|\"Starving Time\"]]. The ''Sea Venture'' passengers had anticipated finding a thriving colony and had brought little food or supplies with them. The colonists at Jamestown were saved only by the timely arrival three weeks later of a supply mission headed by [[Thomas West, 3rd Baron De La Warr]], better known as \"Lord Delaware\".\n[[Image:Va Company Seal.gif|thumb|right|Obverse and Reverse of the Seal of the King in his capacity as President of the Council of Virginia, the inscriptions signifying: \"Seal of the King of Great Britain, France and Ireland\"; \"For his Council of Virginia\"]]\nIn 1612, The London Company's Royal Charter was officially extended to include the Somers Isles as part of the [[Virginia Colony]]. However, the isles passed to the [[Somers Isles Company|London Company of the Somers Isles]] in 1615, which had been formed by the same shareholders as the London Company.\n\nThe Virginia Company of London failed to discover gold or silver in Virginia, to the disappointment of its investors. However, they did establish trade of various types. The biggest trade breakthrough came when colonist John Rolfe introduced several sweeter strains of tobacco<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.foundersofamerica.org/johnrolfe.html |title=Welcome to Founders of America! |access-date=25 May 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070605072826/http://foundersofamerica.org/johnrolfe.html |archive-date=5 June 2007 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> from the Caribbean,<ref>[http://www.historyisfun.org/Economics-of-Tobacco.htm Economics of Tobacco]</ref> rather than the harsh-tasting kind native to Virginia.<ref>[http://www.virtualjamestown.org/jrolfe.html Virtual Jamestown]</ref> Rolfe's new tobacco strains led to a strong export for the London Company and other early English colonies and helped to balance a trade deficit with Spain.\n\nThe [[Jamestown Massacre]] devastated the colony in 1622 and brought unfavorable attention, particularly from King James I who had chartered the Company. There was a period of debate in Britain between Company officers who wished to guard the original charter, and those who wanted the Company to be disbanded. In 1624, the King dissolved the Company and made Virginia a royal colony.<ref name=\"The First Seventeen Years 1624\">The First Seventeen Years: Virginia, 1607\u20131624, Charles E. Hatch, Jr.</ref>\n\n==The charters of the Virginia Company of London==\n\n'''The First charter of the Virginia Company of London, 1606'''\nThe First Charter gave the company the authority to govern its own adventurers and servants through a ruling council in London composed of major shareholders in the enterprise. The members were nominated by the Company and appointed by the King. The council in  England then directed the settlers to appoint their own local council, which proved ineffective. The council had to obtain approval from London for expenditures and laws, and limited the enterprise to 100 square miles.<ref name=\"\u201dFirst\u201d\">{{cite web|url=http://www.let.rug.nl/usa/documents/1600-1650/the-first-virginia-charter-1606.php|title=First Virginia Charter-1606}}</ref>\n\n'''The Second charter of the Virginia Company of London, 1609'''\nThe Second Charter expanded the area of the enterprise from sea to sea and appointed a governor, because the local councils had proven ineffective.

It also owned a large portion of inland Canada. The company established the [[Jamestown, Virginia|Jamestown Settlement]] on May 14, 1607 about 40 miles inland along the [[James River (Virginia)|James River]], a major tributary of the [[Chesapeake Bay]] in [[Virginia]]. In 1620, [[George Calvert]] asked King James I for a charter for English Catholics to add the territory of the Plymouth Company. Also in 1609, a much larger [[Third Supply]] mission was organized. A new purpose-built ship named the ''[[Sea Venture]]'' was rushed into service without the customary sea trials. She became flagship of a fleet of nine ships, with most of the leaders, food, and supplies aboard. Aboard the ''Sea Venture'' were fleet Admiral [[George Somers]], Vice-Admiral [[Christopher Newport]], Virginia Colony governor Sir [[Thomas Gates (governor)|Thomas Gates]], [[William Strachey]], and businessman [[John Rolfe]] with his pregnant wife.\n\nThe Third Supply convoy encountered a hurricane which lasted three days and separated the ships from one another. The ''Sea Venture'' was leaking through its new caulking, and Admiral Somers had it driven aground on a reef to avoid sinking, saving 150 men and women but destroying the ship.<ref>Woodward, Hobson.

At Jamestown, they found that more than 85-percent of the 500 colonists had perished during the [[Starving Time (Jamestown)|\"Starving Time\"]]. The ''Sea Venture'' passengers had anticipated finding a thriving colony and had brought little food or supplies with them. The colonists at Jamestown were saved only by the timely arrival three weeks later of a supply mission headed by [[Thomas West, 3rd Baron De La Warr]], better known as \"Lord Delaware\".\n[[Image:Va Company Seal.gif|thumb|right|Obverse and Reverse of the Seal of the King in his capacity as President of the Council of Virginia, the inscriptions signifying: \"Seal of the King of Great Britain, France and Ireland\"; \"For his Council of Virginia\"]]\nIn 1612, The London Company's Royal Charter was officially extended to include the Somers Isles as part of the [[Virginia Colony]]. However, the isles passed to the [[Somers Isles Company|London Company of the Somers Isles]] in 1615, which had been formed by the same shareholders as the London Company.\n\nThe Virginia Company of London failed to discover gold or silver in Virginia, to the disappointment of its investors. However, they did establish trade of various types.

Producer [[Kevin Feige]] first publicly mentioned ''Guardians of the Galaxy'' as a potential film in 2010 and Marvel Studios announced it was in active development at the July 2012 [[San Diego Comic-Con]]. Gunn was hired to write and direct the film that September. In February 2013, Pratt was hired to play Peter Quill / Star-Lord, and the supporting cast members were subsequently confirmed. [[Principal photography]] began in July 2013 at [[Shepperton Studios]] in England, with filming continuing in London before wrapping up in October 2013. In addition to an original score by [[Tyler Bates]], the film's soundtrack includes several popular songs from the 1960s and 1970s chosen by Gunn.

Twenty-six years later on the abandoned planet Morag, Quill steals a mysterious orb but is attacked by [[Korath the Pursuer|Korath]], a subordinate to the fanatical [[Kree]] militant, [[Ronan the Accuser|Ronan]]. Although Quill escapes with the orb, Yondu discovers his theft and issues a bounty for his capture, while Ronan sends the assassin [[Gamora (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Gamora]] after the orb.\n\nWhen Quill attempts to sell the orb on [[Xandar]], capital of the Nova Empire, Gamora ambushes him and steals it. A fight ensues, drawing in a pair of bounty hunters: the genetically and cybernetically modified raccoon [[Rocket (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Rocket]], and the tree-like humanoid [[Groot (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Groot]]. [[Nova Corps]] officers capture the four, detaining them in the Kyln prison. A powerful inmate there, [[Drax the Destroyer (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Drax]], attempts to kill Gamora due to her association with Thanos and Ronan, who killed his family. Quill convinces Drax that Gamora can bring Ronan to him, though Gamora reveals that she has betrayed Ronan, unwilling to let him use the orb's power. Learning that Gamora intends to sell the orb to the Collector [[Collector (comics)|Taneleer Tivan]], Quill, Rocket, Groot, and Drax work with her to escape the Kyln in Quill's ship, the ''Milano''.\n\nRonan meets with Gamora's adoptive father, Thanos, to discuss her betrayal. Quill's group flee to [[Knowhere]], a remote lawless outpost in space built in the giant severed head of a [[Celestial (comics)|Celestial]]. A drunken Drax summons Ronan while the rest of the group meet Tivan. Tivan opens the orb, revealing the Power [[Infinity Gems|Infinity Stone]], an item of immeasurable power that destroys all but the most powerful beings who wield it. Tivan's slave Carina grabs the Stone, triggering an explosion that engulfs Tivan's archive. Ronan arrives and easily defeats Drax, while the others flee by ship, pursued by Ronan's followers and Gamora's adoptive sister [[Nebula (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Nebula]]. Nebula destroys Gamora's ship, leaving her floating in space, and Ronan's fighters capture the orb.\n\nQuill contacts Yondu before following Gamora into space, giving her his helmet to survive; Yondu arrives and retrieves the pair. Rocket, Drax, and Groot threaten to attack Yondu's ship to rescue them, but Quill negotiates a truce, promising the orb to Yondu. Quill's group agrees that facing Ronan means certain death, but that they cannot let him use the Infinity Stone to destroy the galaxy. On Ronan's flagship, the ''Dark Aster'', Ronan embeds the Stone in his warhammer, taking its power for himself. He contacts Thanos, threatening to kill him after first destroying Xandar; hateful of her adoptive father, Nebula allies with Ronan.\n\nThe Ravagers and Quill's group join with the Nova Corps to confront the ''Dark Aster'' at Xandar, with Quill's group breaching the ''Dark Aster'' with the ''Milano''. Ronan uses his empowered warhammer to destroy the Nova Corps fleet. Drax kills Korath and Gamora defeats Nebula, who escapes, but the group find themselves outmatched by Ronan's power until Rocket crashes a Ravager ship through the ''Dark Aster''. The damaged ''Dark Aster'' crash-lands on Xandar, with Groot sacrificing himself to shield the group. Ronan emerges from the wreck and prepares to destroy Xandar, but Quill distracts him, allowing Drax and Rocket to destroy Ronan's warhammer. Quill grabs the freed Stone, and with Gamora, Drax, and Rocket sharing its burden, uses it to vaporize Ronan.\n\nIn the aftermath, Quill tricks Yondu into taking a container supposedly containing the Stone, and gives the real Stone to the Nova Corps. As the Ravagers leave Xandar, Yondu remarks that it turned out well that they did not deliver Quill to his father per their contract. Quill's group, now known as the Guardians of the Galaxy, have their criminal records expunged, and Quill learns that he is only half-human, his father being part of an ancient, unknown species. Quill finally opens the last present he received from his mother: a cassette tape filled with her favorite songs. The Guardians leave in the rebuilt ''Milano'' along with a potted sapling [[Cutting (plant)|cut]] from Groot, which grows into a baby version of him.\n\nIn a [[post-credits scene]], Tivan sits in his destroyed archive with two of his living exhibits: a canine cosmonaut and an anthropomorphic duck.{{refn|name=Timeline|group=N|Identified offscreen as [[Cosmo the Spacedog]] and [[Howard the Duck]].<ref name=\"StitchKingdom2\" /><ref name=\"Green\" />}}\n\n==Cast==\n{{Tall image|Guardians cast.jpg|150|526|The cast of ''Guardians of the Galaxy'' promoting the film at the 2013 [[San Diego Comic-Con]].

Pratt had lost weight to portray fit characters in films such as ''[[Moneyball (film)|Moneyball]]'' and ''[[Zero Dark Thirty]]'', and had given up ambitions to play the lead role in action films after humbling auditions for ''[[Star Trek (film)|Star Trek]]'' and ''[[Avatar (2009 film)|Avatar]]''. Casting director Sarah Finn suggested Pratt to Gunn, who dismissed the idea despite struggling to cast that role. Despite this, Finn arranged for a meeting between the two, at which point Gunn was immediately convinced that Pratt was perfect for the role. Pratt also won over Feige, despite having gained weight again for ''[[Delivery Man (film)|Delivery Man]]''.<ref name=\"EWJuly2014\" /> Prior to filming, Pratt underwent a strict diet and training regimen to lose {{convert|60|lb}} in six months.<ref name=\"PrattWeight\" /> Pratt signed a multi-film contract with Marvel,<ref name=\"HuffingtonPostNov2013\" /> and was granted a temporary leave from his work on ''Parks and Recreation'' in order to accommodate his participation in the film.<ref name=\"ParksandRec\" /> [[Wyatt Oleff]] portrays a young Quill.<ref name=\"TimeReview\" />\n* [[Zoe Saldana]] as [[Gamora (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Gamora]]: <br />An orphan from an alien world who seeks redemption for her past crimes.

I've been blue before [in ''Avatar''].\"<ref name=\"2013MayMTV\" /> Saldana described Gamora as \"... a warrior, she's an assassin and she's very lethal but what saves her is the same thing that can doom her. She has a sense of righteousness. She's a very righteous individual.\"<ref name=\"SuperheroHypePg1\" />\n* [[Dave Bautista]] as [[Drax the Destroyer (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Drax the Destroyer]]: <br />A warrior who seeks to avenge his family's death at the hands of Ronan.<ref name=\"AICN\" /> On relating to the character, Bautista said, \"I can just relate to Drax so much it's not even funny. Just the simple things that we have in common. Simple things like the tattoos, the tragedy\u2014because, you know, I had a bit of tragedy in my life as well. So it's really easy for me to pull from that.\" Bautista also said that there was \"a lot of comic relief to Drax\", but the character was not aware of it. Bautista stated that he did not do much preparation for the role, because \"Luckily, for me, I'm a lifelong athlete and I adapted real quick.\"<ref name=\"2014Bautista\" /> Bautista's makeup took approximately four hours to apply, though it could be removed in just 90 minutes.<ref name=\"ColliderMay2014\" /> Drax has various scarring patterns on his body, which replace the simple tattoos from the comics, each having a specific story. Additionally, his skin tone was changed from the bright green in the comics to a muddier grey, to avoid visual similarities to the [[Hulk]].<ref name=\"CBRSetVisit\" />\n* [[Vin Diesel]] as [[Groot (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Groot]]: <br />A tree-like humanoid<ref name=\"MarvelSynopsis\" /> who is the accomplice of Rocket. Diesel stated that he provided the voice and [[motion capture]] for Groot, after originally being in talks to star in a new [[Marvel Cinematic Universe: Phase Three|Phase Three]] Marvel film.<ref name=\"DieselTHR\" /><ref name=\"DieselDeadline\" /><ref name=\"DieselConfirm\" /> Diesel also provided Groot's voice for several foreign-language releases of the film.<ref name=\"DieselForeignVoices\" /> Krystian Godlewski portrayed the character on set, though his acting was not used in the final character CGI.<ref name=\"SeanGunnThanos\" /><ref name=\"RocketGrootBI\" /> On the character, which Gunn based on his dog,<ref name=\"RocketGrootInfluence\" /> Gunn said, \"All the Guardians start out the movie as bastards\u2014except Groot. He's an innocent. He's a hundred percent deadly and a hundred percent sweet. He's caught up in Rocket's life, really.\" Gunn added that the design and movement of Groot took \"the better part of a year\" to create.<ref name=\"TotalFilmTrailer3\" /> Gunn added, \"The ways in which Vin Diesel says, 'I am Groot,' I am astounded. All of the 'I am Groots' that were earlier voices didn't sound very good at all ... Vin came in and in one day, laid down all these 'I am Groot' tracks, and he's a perfectionist. He made me explain to him with ever {{sic}} 'I am Groot,' exactly what he was saying ... It was amazing when we first put that voice in there how much the character changed and how much he influenced the character.\"<ref name=\"GunnIGNFeb2014\" /> Regarding the limited words used by Groot, Diesel said in many ways this was, \"... the most challenging thing to ask an actor to do.\"<ref name=\"TheMovieNetwork\"/> Diesel found an emotional note in his performance, invoking the death of his friend and ''[[The Fast and the Furious|Fast and Furious]]'' co-star [[Paul Walker]], saying, \"This was in December [2013], and the first time I came back to dealing with human beings after dealing with death, so playing a character who celebrates life in the way Groot does was very nice.\"<ref name=\"DieselGrootDeath\" /> Groot's form and size-changing abilities are seen, with Gunn stating that he has the ability to grow in the film.<ref name=\"SuperheroHypePg2\" />\n* [[Bradley Cooper]] as [[Rocket (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Rocket<!-- CREDITED ONLY AS \"Rocket\" PER OFFICIAL SYNOPSIS! -->]]: <br />A genetically-engineered [[raccoon]]-based bounty hunter, mercenary, and master of weapons and battle tactics.<ref name=\"StitchKingdom\" /><ref name=\"MarvelSynopsis\" /><ref name=\"CooperOfficial\" /><ref name=\"Cooper\" /> Gunn worked with live raccoons to get the correct feel for the character, and to make sure it was \"not a cartoon character\", saying, \"It's not [[Bugs Bunny]] in the middle of the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], it's a real, little, somewhat mangled beast that's alone. There's no one else in the universe quite like him, he's been created by these guys to be a mean-ass fighting machine.\"<ref name=\"GunnRocket\" /> Gunn also based the character on himself.<ref name=\"RocketGrootInfluence\" /> Describing Rocket in relation to the rest of the Guardians, Cooper said, \"I think Rocket is dynamic. He's the sort of [[Joe Pesci]] in ''[[Goodfellas]]'' guy.\"<ref name=\"Cooper2\" /> Cooper voiced Rocket, while [[Sean Gunn]] (James' younger brother) stood in for the character during filming.<ref name=\"RocketStandIn\" /> James Gunn said that for the role of Rocket, some physical movement from Cooper, including facial expressions and hand movements, was recorded as potential reference for the animators,<ref name=\"2013NovDelToro\" /> though much of Sean Gunn's acting is used throughout the film.<ref name=\"SeanGunnThanos\" /> Sean noted they \"kind of stumbled\" into the process of him performing on set since they \"weren't sure how we were going to create that character\". The same process would continue to be used for all subsequent appearances of Rocket.<ref name=\"SeanGunnSept2018\" /> Before Cooper was cast, James Gunn said that it was a challenge finding a voice for Rocket, that he was looking for someone that could balance \"the fast-talking speech patterns that Rocket has, but also can be funny, because he is really funny. But also has the heart that Rocket has. Because there are actually some pretty dramatic scenes with Rocket.\"<ref name=\"IGNRocketJun2014\" />\n* [[Lee Pace]] as [[Ronan the Accuser]]: <br />A renegade [[Kree]] commander and zealot who agrees to retrieve an artifact for Thanos in exchange for the annihilation of his mortal enemies, the Xandarians. Ronan and his [[Planet Hulk|Sakaaran]] army<ref name=\"SuperheroHypePg3\" /> hunt down the Guardians when they interfere with his goals.<ref name=\"StitchKingdom\" /><ref name=\"AMCYoutube\" /> Describing Ronan, Gunn said, \"He is the primary villain, and he is a really twisted guy, he has a really religious bent in this film. He has a very sick and twisted view of what morality is; strength is virtue and weakness is sin and that is what he lives by, and I think he is very scary because of his beliefs, which are real to him.\"<ref name=\"DigitalSpy\" /> Pace, who originally auditioned for Peter Quill,<ref name=\"2012DecPace\" /> described Ronan as a \"psycho\" and a \"monster\".<ref name=\"PaceOctober2013\" />\n* [[Michael Rooker]] as [[Yondu|Yondu Udonta]]: <br />A blue-skinned bandit who is the leader of the Ravagers and a paternal figure to Quill.<ref name=\"StitchKingdom\" /><ref name=\"2013AprilRooker\" /> Yondu helps Quill to steal the orb before Quill betrays him, leaving Yondu and the Ravagers to chase the Guardians. On the character, Rooker said, he has \"some interesting issues\u2014not a good guy, not a bad guy. There's hope and there's a heart inside Yondu.\" Gunn created the film's version of the character specifically with Rooker in mind, while borrowing the character's mohawk and use of a whistle-controlled arrow from the comics. Rooker fully committed to the role once he knew his role on the TV series ''[[The Walking Dead (TV series)|The Walking Dead]]'' would be ending.<ref name=\"RookerUSAToday\" /> Rooker's makeup took approximately four hours to apply.<ref name=\"RookerMakeup\" />\n* [[Karen Gillan]] as [[Nebula (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Nebula]]: <br />An adopted daughter of Thanos who was raised with Gamora as siblings and is a loyal lieutenant in the employ of Ronan and Thanos.<ref name=\"StitchKingdom\" /><ref name=\"SlashFilmApr2014\" /> About the character, Gillan said, \"She is the female villain of the film ... She is very sadistic and evil, but I like to think for a very valid reason.\"<ref name=\"2013NovGillan\" /> She also added, \"I think she's a really interesting character. What I like to play around with is how jealous she is. She's Gamora's sister, and there's a lot of [[sibling rivalry]]. That's the most interesting aspect to me, because jealousy can consume you and turn you bitter, and ugly.

He's got all the costumes. One day he looks at me and says 'Dad, I want to be light-skinned so I could be Spider-Man. Spider-Man has light skin.' That was sort of a shock.

Feige added, should the film be made, it would feature an ensemble of characters, similar to ''[[X-Men (film series)|X-Men]]'' and ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]''.<ref name=\"2011SeptEW\" />\n\nFeige announced that the film was in active development at the 2012 San Diego Comic-Con International during the Marvel Studios panel, with an intended release date of August 1, 2014.

He felt that \"having Thanos be in that scene was more helpful to the [MCU] than it was to ''Guardians of the Galaxy'',\" yet he still wanted Thanos in the film, without \"[belittling] the actual antagonist of the film, which is Ronan.\" To solve his dilemma, Gunn chose to have Ronan kill \"The Other\", Thanos' vizier, saying, \"I thought that was interesting, because we've had the Other, who's obviously very powerful even in comparison to [[Loki (Marvel Comics)|Loki]], and then we see Ronan wipe his ass with him. So that I liked, but even that was sort of difficult, because it played as funnier when I first wrote it, and the humor didn't work so much.\"<ref name=\"GunnVultureThanos\" />\n\n===Pre-production===\nIn September 2012, Gunn confirmed that he had signed on to direct the film and rewrite the script.<ref name=\"2012SepGunn\" /> By the end of November, [[Joel Edgerton]], [[Jack Huston]], [[Jim Sturgess]], and [[Eddie Redmayne]] signed deals to test for the role of [[Peter Quill (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Peter Quill]], as did [[Lee Pace]],<ref name=\"2012NovTestDeals\" /> which he confirmed a week later in early December.<ref name=\"2012DecPace\" /> Other actors who were considered for the role included ''[[Thor: The Dark World]]''{{'}}s [[Zachary Levi]],<ref name=\"2012Dec21Quill\" /> [[Joseph Gordon-Levitt]],<ref name=\"2013JanJGL\" /> [[Michael Rosenbaum]],<ref name=\"2013JanRosenbaum\" /> and [[John Gallagher Jr.]]<ref name=\"GallagherStarLord\" /> [[Chris Pratt]] was cast in the role in February 2013, as part of a multi-film deal that he signed with Marvel.<ref name=\"HuffingtonPostNov2013\" /><ref name=\"2013FebPratt\" />\n\n[[File:James Gunn by Gage Skidmore.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Gunn promoting the film at the 2013 [[San Diego Comic-Con]]]]\nIn January 2013, filming was scheduled to take place at [[Shepperton Studios]] in London, United Kingdom,<ref name=\"2013JanShepperton\" /> and Marvel Studios announced that the film would be released in [[3D film|3D]].<ref name=\"2013Jan3D\" /> Victoria Alonso, an executive producer on the film, said that filming would begin in June.

It takes place in the same universe. And when we've been on the other side of that universe in other movies, you might see those characteristics in Guardians, but the Avengers are not involved with what's happening out there at this time.\" Feige also stated that 95% of the film would take place in space.<ref name=\"2013MarchSFX\" /> In mid-March, [[Dave Bautista]] was signed to play [[Drax the Destroyer (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Drax the Destroyer]].<ref name=\"2013MarchBautista\" /> Other actors who had been considered for the role included [[Isaiah Mustafa]], [[Brian Patrick Wade]], and [[Jason Momoa]].<ref name=\"2013MarchBautista\" /> By the following week, sculptor [[Brian Muir (sculptor)|Brian Muir]], who sculpted [[Darth Vader]]'s mask for the ''[[Star Wars]]'' films, was revealed to be working on the film.<ref name=\"2013MarchMuir\" />\n\nIn early April 2013, [[Zoe Saldana]] entered into negotiations to star as [[Gamora (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Gamora]] in the film, and it was confirmed she had been cast later that month.<ref name=\"2013AprilLovibond\" /><ref name=\"2013AprilSaldana\" /> Also in April, [[Michael Rooker]] joined the film's cast as [[Yondu]],<ref name=\"2013AprilRooker\" /> and it was announced that [[Ophelia Lovibond]] had been cast in a supporting role.<ref name=\"2013AprilLovibond\" /> By this point in time, [[Lee Pace]] was in final negotiations to play the villain of the film.<ref name=\"2013AprilPace\" /> In May, Marvel offered [[John C.

White said, \"James always pushed for practical and makeup effects. He wanted, like me, to see the real deal there on set.\" White was careful not to use \"modern\" creature designs to ensure they did not fall short in Gunn's uniquely envisioned world. White and his team created upwards of 1,000 prosthetic makeup applications and 2,000 molds of different-colored aliens.<ref name=\"WhiteMakeup\" /> For the specific aesthetic look to the film, Gunn wanted to create \"a colorful science-fiction world\", and include elements of 1950s and '60s pulp movies, citing the Ravagers' spaceships, which he compared to muscle cars, as an example of the latter.<ref name=\"GunnDesign\" /> Science fiction artist [[Chris Foss]] inspired and helped design the final look of some of the spacecrafts that appear in the film.<ref name=\"ChrisFoss\" /> The ''[[Mass Effect]]'' video game series, [[Flash Gordon]], ''[[Farscape]]'', and ''[[Star Wars]]'' were primary inspirations for Gunn on the film.<ref name=\"GunnInspirations\" />\n\n===Filming===\nPrincipal photography began around July 6, 2013 in [[London]], United Kingdom,<ref name=\"2013JulyComicCon\" /> under the working title of ''Full Tilt''.<ref name=\"SuperheroHypePg1\" /> Filming took place at Shepperton Studios and [[Longcross Studios]].<ref name=\"2013JanShepperton\" /><ref name=\"DavisInterview\" /> Later in July, Gunn and the film's cast flew from London to attend San Diego Comic-Con International, where it was revealed that Pace would play Ronan the Accuser, Gillan would be [[Nebula (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Nebula]], del Toro as [[Collector (comics)|The Collector]], and that [[Djimon Hounsou]] had been cast as [[Korath the Pursuer|Korath]].<ref name=\"2013JulyComicCon\" /><ref name=\"2013JulyMarvel\" /> Close was later revealed to play [[Nova Corps#Known members|Nova Prime Irani Rael]].<ref name=\"StitchKingdom\" /><ref name=\"2013JulyMarvel\" /> Also at San Diego Comic-Con, Feige stated that Thanos would be a part of the film as the \"mastermind\".<ref name=\"2013JulyFeige\" /> On August 11, 2013, filming began at London's [[Millennium Bridge, London|Millennium Bridge]],<ref name=\"Entertainmentwise\" /> which was selected as a double for [[Xandar]].<ref name=\"CBRSetVisit\" /> In August 2013, Marvel announced that [[Bradley Cooper]] would voice Rocket.<ref name=\"CooperOfficial\" /> On September 3, 2013, Gunn said that filming was \"a little over half[way]\" complete.<ref name=\"2013SeptMTV\" /> Also in September, [[Vin Diesel]] stated that he was voicing Groot.<ref name=\"DieselConfirm\" /> However, Marvel did not confirm Diesel's involvement in the film at the time.<ref name=\"RocketStandIn\" /><ref name=\"2013NovDelToro\" /><ref name=\"HuffingtonPostOct2013\" /> On October 12, 2013, Gunn announced on social media that filming had completed.<ref name=\"FilmingEnding\" />\n\n[[Director of photography]] [[Ben Davis (cinematographer)|Ben Davis]] used [[Arri Alexa#Alexa XT|Arri Alexa XT]] cameras for the film, saying, \"I'm traditionally a photochemical fan, but going with the digital format was the right way for this movie ... the Alexa [provided] the right look for this particular film.\" During the opening scenes in the 1980s, Davis chose JDC Cooke Xtal (Crystal) Express anamorphic prime lenses because they \"had more anamorphic artifacts and aberrations, which [he] felt added something.\" Davis used spherical [[Panavision]] Primos for the rest of the film. Additionally, Davis worked closely with production designer Charles Wood in order to achieve the correct lighting looks for each scene.<ref name=\"DavisInterview\" /> Dealing with two fully CGI characters forced Davis to shoot scenes multiple times, usually once with the references for the characters and once without them in the shot.<ref name=\"DavisInterview2\" />\n\nGunn revealed that his brother, Sean Gunn, took on multiple roles during the filming process, such as standing in for Rocket, which he noted was beneficial for the other actors, including Saldana, Pratt, and Bautista, who responded positively to Sean and his on-set performances.<ref name=\"SeanGunnThanos\" /> Special effects makeup designer David White made two life-size versions of Rocket and a bust of Groot as aids for visual effects, with White saying, \"it gives [the filmmakers] a good indication of where visual effects needs to pick up and whether Rocket can actually reach certain things or use certain devices.\"<ref name=\"RocketGrootBI\" /> These busts were also used to see how the on-set lighting would affect the characters, to assist with the visual effects lighting process.<ref name=\"RocketGrootBI\" />\n\nIn January 2015, Disney revealed that the film came in \"slightly over the agreed budget\" at $232.3 million, with Disney receiving a rebate of $36.4 million from the British government.<ref name=\"ActualBudget\" /> It was previously estimated to have had a $170 million budget.<ref name=\"Tracking\" />\n\n===Post-production===\nIn November 2013, Gunn stated that he attempted to use as many practical effects as possible while filming to aid the use of CGI and motion capture during post-production, saying, \"Our sets are enormous.

We visit five planets, we see a hundred different races.\" The film introduces the alien race [[Planet Hulk|Sakaaran]], who act as Ronan's mercenaries, as a replacement to the [[Badoon]], as the Badoon film rights belonged to [[20th Century Fox]].<ref name=\"SuperheroHypePg3\" />\n\nBy the end of May, [[Josh Brolin]] was revealed as the voice of Thanos,<ref name=\"ThanosCast\" /><ref name=\"BrolinThanos\" /> with Feige confirming in July that Brolin also provided the performance capture for the character.<ref name=\"BrolinPerformance\" /> Thanos communicates via hologram for much of the film, though he does appear in a scene with Ronan and Nebula.<ref name=\"VultureThanos\" /> In June 2014, Feige added that Thanos and his followers are \"the biggest piece of connective tissue that will eventually lead us back into ''Avengers'' films in the future.\"<ref name=\"FeigeTotalFilm\" /> On casting Brolin, Feige said,\n\n<blockquote>We reached out to him and it was one of those things that does not happen all the time but when it does it's very nice, where he was totally intrigued. He was a fan of what we did, he met with Jeremy Latcham in a hotel in London and learned about the characters a little bit. I spoke to him on the phone a few times. We ran it by James who loved it, ran it by Joss [Whedon] who loved it because Thanos is in this universe because of ''Avengers''. Then we shot him and recorded for it.<ref name=\"BrolinPerformance\" /></blockquote>\n\nOn July 7, 2014, Gunn announced on social media that he had completed work on the film.<ref name=\"GotGComplete\" /> In August, regarding the post-credit scene, Gunn revealed that the scene did not involve [[Howard the Duck]] when it was originally filmed, rather he was added during post-production,<ref name=\"GunnHowardDuck\" /> a decision made by \"some combination of [Gunn] and the editor Fred Raskin\".<ref name=\"Corlett\" /> As the decision to add the character was made late in the post-production process, he had to be designed that day, before being handed off to Sony Pictures Imageworks to animate. Also in August, regarding the pre-credit scene of Baby Groot dancing, Gunn stated that he himself danced to provide motion reference for the animators, and that the decision was made to place the scene before the credits, rather than during or after them, because of positive responses from a test audience, which made Marvel and Gunn feel that they did not want \"people walking out and missing this thing\".<ref name=\"Corlett\" /> Marvel used design firm Sarofsky once again for the film's title sequences, after liking their work for ''[[Captain America: The Winter Soldier]]''. Sarofsky developed a custom [[typeface]] based on the font used in the teaser posters for the opening credits, which was tinted orange to offer a better contrast to the film's blue and grey imagery.

MPC visual effects supervisor Nicolas Aithadi explained that, \"When you look at humans what makes the eyes interesting is the imperfections\u2014trying to make these two irises not aimed at the same place\u2014trying to make them strange and look more human.\"<ref name=\"FXGuide\" /> Textures for Groot came from a number of sources, including inspiration from a botanical garden in London, and the character was modeled as individual branches, rigged individually, to simulate a muscle system for the character.<ref name=\"FXGuide\" />\n\nOne of the major challenges for Framestore in creating Rocket was his fur. Framestore's Rachel Williams explained that, since \"raccoon fur is made up from a layer of short fine hair and a layer of longer thicker hairs\", these layers were separated and animated individually, removing the need to use \"guide hairs\" to control the movements of thick sections of fur.<ref name=\"FXGuide\" /> Framestore and MPC worked closely sharing assets, to ensure shots of Rocket at MPC would match the Rocket created by Framestore, and vice versa for when Groot was needed by the other studio.<ref name=\"FXGuide\" />\n\nIn order to give Thanos \"the performance and the weight that he deserved\", Luma Pictures created a new facial animation system to re-create Josh Brolin as a fully CG character, using his \"eyes, some of his cheek, how his muscles move when he talks\". The character's large jaw, and the deep groves that run down his face, had \"to be carefully planned out with the movement of his face.\"<ref name=\"FXGuide\" />\n\n==Music==\n{{main|Guardians of the Galaxy (soundtrack)}}\nIn August 2013, Gunn revealed that [[Tyler Bates]] would be composing the film's score. Gunn stated that Bates would write some of the score first so that he can film to the music, as opposed to scoring to the film.<ref name=\"Bates\" /> In February 2014, Gunn revealed that the film would incorporate songs from the 1960s and 1970s, such as \"[[Hooked on a Feeling]]\", on a mixtape in Quill's [[Walkman]], which acts as a way for him to stay connected to the Earth, home, and family he lost.<ref name=\"TotalFilmTrailer6\" /> In May 2014, Gunn added that using the songs from the '60s and '70s were \"cultural reference points\", saying, \"It's striking the balance throughout the whole movie, through something that is very unique, but also something that is easily accessible to people at the same time. The music and the Earth stuff is one of those touchstones that we have to remind us that, yeah, [Quill] is a real person from planet Earth who's just like you and me. Except that he's in this big outer space adventure.\"<ref name=\"IGNMay2014\" />\n\nWhen choosing the songs, Gunn revealed he \"started the process by reading the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' charts for all of the top hits of the '70s\", downloading \"a few hundred\" songs that were \"semi-familiar\u2014ones you recognize but might not be able to name off the top of your head\" and creating a playlist for all the songs that would fit the film tonally. He added that he \"would listen to the playlist on my speakers around the house\u2014sometimes I would be inspired to create a scene around a song, and other times I had a scene that needed music and I would listen through the playlist, visualizing various songs, figuring out which would work the best.\"<ref name=\"VultureMusic\" /> Most of the songs were played on set to help \"the actors and the camera operators find the perfect groove for the shot\", with [[David Bowie]]'s \"[[Moonage Daydream]]\" the only song chosen and added during post-production. Gunn also said that the opening scenes were designed with \"Hooked on a Feeling\" in mind; however, once Gunn discovered \"[[Come and Get Your Love]]\", the song used in the sequence, Gunn felt it was a \"better fit.\"<ref name=\"VultureMusic\" />\n\nThree albums were released by [[Hollywood Records]] on July 29, 2014: The film's score, ''Guardians of the Galaxy (Original Score)'', which features the music composed by Bates for the film;<ref name=\"Score\" /> ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (soundtrack)|Guardians of the Galaxy: Awesome Mix Vol. 1 (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack)]]'', which comprises the twelve songs from Quill's mixtape; and a deluxe edition featuring both albums.<ref name=\"Soundtracks\" /> By August 2014, the album which mirrored Quill's mixtape had reached the top of the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart, becoming the first soundtrack album in history consisting entirely of previously released songs to top the chart.<ref name=\"AwesomeMixChart\" /> Hollywood Records also released a cassette version of the ''Awesome Mix Vol. 1'' soundtrack on November 28, 2014, as an exclusive to [[Record Store Day]] participants.

Licensees embraced Rocket as the film's potential breakout character, with Drax and Gamora being used for older demographics; Star-Lord's obsession with 1980s nostalgia, including his \"Awesome Mix Vo. 1\" cassette, has also served as a basis for tie-in products.<ref name=\"VarietyMarketingJun2014\" /> In August 2014, Funko announced a toy based on \"Dancing Groot\",<ref name=\"THRBabyGroot\" /> while in October 2014, Marvel and KID designs announced a replica of dancing Groot, for release in December 2014.<ref name=\"KIDDancingGroot\" />\n\nIn December 2014, Disney made a second marketing push, to coincide with the film's home media release with additional merchandise. Merchandise partners included: KID designs with its replica dancing Groot; Funko's Fabrikations line with a plush Rocket; Mattel's Hot Wheels character cars; C-Life, Hybrid-Jem Sportswear, Freeze, MZ Berger, Accutime, AME and Her Universe with apparel; ThinkGeek with jewelry and watches; American Greetings with cards; Jay Franco with homegoods; and Vandor with drinkware. Additional partners included Mad Engine, Just Play, and Dragon Models. Paul Gitter, senior vice-president of Marvel licensing at Disney Consumer Products said, \"The demand for ''Guardians of the Galaxy'' merchandise has been truly out of this world.

The changing aspect ratios in this case are actually a part of the storytelling.\"<ref name=\"Gunn3D\" /> In July 2014, Gunn revealed that there were multiple scenes he had cut from the film, and he was investigating how to release them, either in an extended cut of the film, or as bonus features on the film's home media release.<ref name=\"BrolinPerformance\" />\n\n===Home media===\n''Guardians of the Galaxy'' was released for [[Digital distribution|digital download]] by [[Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment]] on November 18, 2014 and on [[Blu-ray]], [[Blu-ray Disc#Blu-ray 3D|Blu-ray 3D]], and [[DVD]] on November 24, 2014, in the United Kingdom and on December 9 in the United States.<ref name=\"UKBlu-ray\" /><ref name=\"Blu-ray\" /> The digital and Blu-ray releases include behind-the-scenes featurettes, audio commentary, deleted scenes, a blooper reel, and an exclusive preview of ''[[Avengers: Age of Ultron]]''.<ref name=\"Blu-ray\" /> {{as of|2015|10|4|df=US}}, the film has earned over $118 million in sales in the US.<ref name=\"HomeSales\" />\n\nThe film was also included in the 13-disc [[box set]], titled \"[[Marvel Cinematic Universe: Phase Two#Home media|Marvel Cinematic Universe: Phase Two Collection]]\", which includes all of the Phase Two films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.

Produced by [[Marvel Studios]] and distributed by [[Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures]], it is [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe films|the 10th film]] in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU). The film was directed by [[James Gunn]], who wrote the screenplay with [[Nicole Perlman]], and features an [[ensemble cast]] including [[Chris Pratt]], [[Zoe Saldana]], [[Dave Bautista]], [[Vin Diesel]], and [[Bradley Cooper]] as the titular Guardians, along with [[Lee Pace]], [[Michael Rooker]], [[Karen Gillan]], [[Djimon Hounsou]], [[John C. Reilly]], [[Glenn Close]], and [[Benicio del Toro]]<!--DO NOT ADD JOSH BROLIN HERE. IT IS NOT A BILLED ROLE. THANK YOU! -->. In the film, [[Peter Quill (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Peter Quill]] and a group of extraterrestrial criminals go on the run after stealing a powerful artifact.\n\nPerlman began working on the screenplay in 2009. Producer [[Kevin Feige]] first publicly mentioned ''Guardians of the Galaxy'' as a potential film in 2010 and Marvel Studios announced it was in active development at the July 2012 [[San Diego Comic-Con]]. Gunn was hired to write and direct the film that September. In February 2013, Pratt was hired to play Peter Quill / Star-Lord, and the supporting cast members were subsequently confirmed. [[Principal photography]] began in July 2013 at [[Shepperton Studios]] in England, with filming continuing in London before wrapping up in October 2013. In addition to an original score by [[Tyler Bates]], the film's soundtrack includes several popular songs from the 1960s and 1970s chosen by Gunn. Post-production was completed on July 7, 2014.\n\n''Guardians of the Galaxy'' premiered at the [[Dolby Theatre]] in Hollywood on July 21, 2014, and was theatrically released in the United States on August 1, as part of [[Marvel Cinematic Universe: Phase Two|Phase Two]] of the MCU. The film became a critical and commercial success, grossing $772.8 million worldwide and becoming the highest-grossing superhero film of 2014, as well as the [[2014 in film|third-highest-grossing film of 2014]]. The film was praised for its screenplay, direction, acting, humor, soundtrack, visual effects, and action sequences. At the [[87th Academy Awards]], the film received nominations for [[Academy Award for Best Visual Effects|Best Visual Effects]] and [[Academy Award for Best Makeup and Hairstyling|Best Makeup and Hairstyling]]. A sequel, ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2]]'', was released in 2017. A third film, ''Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3'', is in development.\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Plot==\n<!--per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be kept between 400 to 700 words! -->\nIn 1988, following his mother's death, a young [[Peter Quill (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Peter Quill]] is abducted from Earth by the Ravagers, a group of alien thieves and smugglers led by [[Yondu|Yondu Udonta]]. Twenty-six years later on the abandoned planet Morag, Quill steals a mysterious orb but is attacked by [[Korath the Pursuer|Korath]], a subordinate to the fanatical [[Kree]] militant, [[Ronan the Accuser|Ronan]]. Although Quill escapes with the orb, Yondu discovers his theft and issues a bounty for his capture, while Ronan sends the assassin [[Gamora (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Gamora]] after the orb.\n\nWhen Quill attempts to sell the orb on [[Xandar]], capital of the Nova Empire, Gamora ambushes him and steals it. A fight ensues, drawing in a pair of bounty hunters: the genetically and cybernetically modified raccoon [[Rocket (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Rocket]], and the tree-like humanoid [[Groot (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Groot]]. [[Nova Corps]] officers capture the four, detaining them in the Kyln prison. A powerful inmate there, [[Drax the Destroyer (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Drax]], attempts to kill Gamora due to her association with Thanos and Ronan, who killed his family. Quill convinces Drax that Gamora can bring Ronan to him, though Gamora reveals that she has betrayed Ronan, unwilling to let him use the orb's power. Learning that Gamora intends to sell the orb to the Collector [[Collector (comics)|Taneleer Tivan]], Quill, Rocket, Groot, and Drax work with her to escape the Kyln in Quill's ship, the ''Milano''.\n\nRonan meets with Gamora's adoptive father, Thanos, to discuss her betrayal. Quill's group flee to [[Knowhere]], a remote lawless outpost in space built in the giant severed head of a [[Celestial (comics)|Celestial]]. A drunken Drax summons Ronan while the rest of the group meet Tivan. Tivan opens the orb, revealing the Power [[Infinity Gems|Infinity Stone]], an item of immeasurable power that destroys all but the most powerful beings who wield it. Tivan's slave Carina grabs the Stone, triggering an explosion that engulfs Tivan's archive. Ronan arrives and easily defeats Drax, while the others flee by ship, pursued by Ronan's followers and Gamora's adoptive sister [[Nebula (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Nebula]]. Nebula destroys Gamora's ship, leaving her floating in space, and Ronan's fighters capture the orb.\n\nQuill contacts Yondu before following Gamora into space, giving her his helmet to survive; Yondu arrives and retrieves the pair. Rocket, Drax, and Groot threaten to attack Yondu's ship to rescue them, but Quill negotiates a truce, promising the orb to Yondu. Quill's group agrees that facing Ronan means certain death, but that they cannot let him use the Infinity Stone to destroy the galaxy. On Ronan's flagship, the ''Dark Aster'', Ronan embeds the Stone in his warhammer, taking its power for himself. He contacts Thanos, threatening to kill him after first destroying Xandar; hateful of her adoptive father, Nebula allies with Ronan.\n\nThe Ravagers and Quill's group join with the Nova Corps to confront the ''Dark Aster'' at Xandar, with Quill's group breaching the ''Dark Aster'' with the ''Milano''. Ronan uses his empowered warhammer to destroy the Nova Corps fleet. Drax kills Korath and Gamora defeats Nebula, who escapes, but the group find themselves outmatched by Ronan's power until Rocket crashes a Ravager ship through the ''Dark Aster''. The damaged ''Dark Aster'' crash-lands on Xandar, with Groot sacrificing himself to shield the group. Ronan emerges from the wreck and prepares to destroy Xandar, but Quill distracts him, allowing Drax and Rocket to destroy Ronan's warhammer. Quill grabs the freed Stone, and with Gamora, Drax, and Rocket sharing its burden, uses it to vaporize Ronan.\n\nIn the aftermath, Quill tricks Yondu into taking a container supposedly containing the Stone, and gives the real Stone to the Nova Corps. As the Ravagers leave Xandar, Yondu remarks that it turned out well that they did not deliver Quill to his father per their contract. Quill's group, now known as the Guardians of the Galaxy, have their criminal records expunged, and Quill learns that he is only half-human, his father being part of an ancient, unknown species. Quill finally opens the last present he received from his mother: a cassette tape filled with her favorite songs. The Guardians leave in the rebuilt ''Milano'' along with a potted sapling [[Cutting (plant)|cut]] from Groot, which grows into a baby version of him.\n\nIn a [[post-credits scene]], Tivan sits in his destroyed archive with two of his living exhibits: a canine cosmonaut and an anthropomorphic duck.{{refn|name=Timeline|group=N|Identified offscreen as [[Cosmo the Spacedog]] and [[Howard the Duck]].<ref name=\"StitchKingdom2\" /><ref name=\"Green\" />}}\n\n==Cast==\n{{Tall image|Guardians cast.jpg|150|526|The cast of ''Guardians of the Galaxy'' promoting the film at the 2013 [[San Diego Comic-Con]].

Pratt had lost weight to portray fit characters in films such as ''[[Moneyball (film)|Moneyball]]'' and ''[[Zero Dark Thirty]]'', and had given up ambitions to play the lead role in action films after humbling auditions for ''[[Star Trek (film)|Star Trek]]'' and ''[[Avatar (2009 film)|Avatar]]''. Casting director Sarah Finn suggested Pratt to Gunn, who dismissed the idea despite struggling to cast that role. Despite this, Finn arranged for a meeting between the two, at which point Gunn was immediately convinced that Pratt was perfect for the role. Pratt also won over Feige, despite having gained weight again for ''[[Delivery Man (film)|Delivery Man]]''.<ref name=\"EWJuly2014\" /> Prior to filming, Pratt underwent a strict diet and training regimen to lose {{convert|60|lb}} in six months.<ref name=\"PrattWeight\" /> Pratt signed a multi-film contract with Marvel,<ref name=\"HuffingtonPostNov2013\" /> and was granted a temporary leave from his work on ''Parks and Recreation'' in order to accommodate his participation in the film.<ref name=\"ParksandRec\" /> [[Wyatt Oleff]] portrays a young Quill.<ref name=\"TimeReview\" />\n* [[Zoe Saldana]] as [[Gamora (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Gamora]]: <br />An orphan from an alien world who seeks redemption for her past crimes.

I've been blue before [in ''Avatar''].\"<ref name=\"2013MayMTV\" /> Saldana described Gamora as \"... a warrior, she's an assassin and she's very lethal but what saves her is the same thing that can doom her. She has a sense of righteousness. She's a very righteous individual.\"<ref name=\"SuperheroHypePg1\" />\n* [[Dave Bautista]] as [[Drax the Destroyer (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Drax the Destroyer]]: <br />A warrior who seeks to avenge his family's death at the hands of Ronan.<ref name=\"AICN\" /> On relating to the character, Bautista said, \"I can just relate to Drax so much it's not even funny. Just the simple things that we have in common. Simple things like the tattoos, the tragedy\u2014because, you know, I had a bit of tragedy in my life as well. So it's really easy for me to pull from that.\" Bautista also said that there was \"a lot of comic relief to Drax\", but the character was not aware of it. Bautista stated that he did not do much preparation for the role, because \"Luckily, for me, I'm a lifelong athlete and I adapted real quick.\"<ref name=\"2014Bautista\" /> Bautista's makeup took approximately four hours to apply, though it could be removed in just 90 minutes.<ref name=\"ColliderMay2014\" /> Drax has various scarring patterns on his body, which replace the simple tattoos from the comics, each having a specific story. Additionally, his skin tone was changed from the bright green in the comics to a muddier grey, to avoid visual similarities to the [[Hulk]].<ref name=\"CBRSetVisit\" />\n* [[Vin Diesel]] as [[Groot (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Groot]]: <br />A tree-like humanoid<ref name=\"MarvelSynopsis\" /> who is the accomplice of Rocket. Diesel stated that he provided the voice and [[motion capture]] for Groot, after originally being in talks to star in a new [[Marvel Cinematic Universe: Phase Three|Phase Three]] Marvel film.<ref name=\"DieselTHR\" /><ref name=\"DieselDeadline\" /><ref name=\"DieselConfirm\" /> Diesel also provided Groot's voice for several foreign-language releases of the film.<ref name=\"DieselForeignVoices\" /> Krystian Godlewski portrayed the character on set, though his acting was not used in the final character CGI.<ref name=\"SeanGunnThanos\" /><ref name=\"RocketGrootBI\" /> On the character, which Gunn based on his dog,<ref name=\"RocketGrootInfluence\" /> Gunn said, \"All the Guardians start out the movie as bastards\u2014except Groot. He's an innocent. He's a hundred percent deadly and a hundred percent sweet. He's caught up in Rocket's life, really.\" Gunn added that the design and movement of Groot took \"the better part of a year\" to create.<ref name=\"TotalFilmTrailer3\" /> Gunn added, \"The ways in which Vin Diesel says, 'I am Groot,' I am astounded. All of the 'I am Groots' that were earlier voices didn't sound very good at all ... Vin came in and in one day, laid down all these 'I am Groot' tracks, and he's a perfectionist. He made me explain to him with ever {{sic}} 'I am Groot,' exactly what he was saying ... It was amazing when we first put that voice in there how much the character changed and how much he influenced the character.\"<ref name=\"GunnIGNFeb2014\" /> Regarding the limited words used by Groot, Diesel said in many ways this was, \"... the most challenging thing to ask an actor to do.\"<ref name=\"TheMovieNetwork\"/> Diesel found an emotional note in his performance, invoking the death of his friend and ''[[The Fast and the Furious|Fast and Furious]]'' co-star [[Paul Walker]], saying, \"This was in December [2013], and the first time I came back to dealing with human beings after dealing with death, so playing a character who celebrates life in the way Groot does was very nice.\"<ref name=\"DieselGrootDeath\" /> Groot's form and size-changing abilities are seen, with Gunn stating that he has the ability to grow in the film.<ref name=\"SuperheroHypePg2\" />\n* [[Bradley Cooper]] as [[Rocket (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Rocket<!-- CREDITED ONLY AS \"Rocket\" PER OFFICIAL SYNOPSIS! -->]]: <br />A genetically-engineered [[raccoon]]-based bounty hunter, mercenary, and master of weapons and battle tactics.<ref name=\"StitchKingdom\" /><ref name=\"MarvelSynopsis\" /><ref name=\"CooperOfficial\" /><ref name=\"Cooper\" /> Gunn worked with live raccoons to get the correct feel for the character, and to make sure it was \"not a cartoon character\", saying, \"It's not [[Bugs Bunny]] in the middle of the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], it's a real, little, somewhat mangled beast that's alone. There's no one else in the universe quite like him, he's been created by these guys to be a mean-ass fighting machine.\"<ref name=\"GunnRocket\" /> Gunn also based the character on himself.<ref name=\"RocketGrootInfluence\" /> Describing Rocket in relation to the rest of the Guardians, Cooper said, \"I think Rocket is dynamic. He's the sort of [[Joe Pesci]] in ''[[Goodfellas]]'' guy.\"<ref name=\"Cooper2\" /> Cooper voiced Rocket, while [[Sean Gunn]] (James' younger brother) stood in for the character during filming.<ref name=\"RocketStandIn\" /> James Gunn said that for the role of Rocket, some physical movement from Cooper, including facial expressions and hand movements, was recorded as potential reference for the animators,<ref name=\"2013NovDelToro\" /> though much of Sean Gunn's acting is used throughout the film.<ref name=\"SeanGunnThanos\" /> Sean noted they \"kind of stumbled\" into the process of him performing on set since they \"weren't sure how we were going to create that character\". The same process would continue to be used for all subsequent appearances of Rocket.<ref name=\"SeanGunnSept2018\" /> Before Cooper was cast, James Gunn said that it was a challenge finding a voice for Rocket, that he was looking for someone that could balance \"the fast-talking speech patterns that Rocket has, but also can be funny, because he is really funny. But also has the heart that Rocket has. Because there are actually some pretty dramatic scenes with Rocket.\"<ref name=\"IGNRocketJun2014\" />\n* [[Lee Pace]] as [[Ronan the Accuser]]: <br />A renegade [[Kree]] commander and zealot who agrees to retrieve an artifact for Thanos in exchange for the annihilation of his mortal enemies, the Xandarians. Ronan and his [[Planet Hulk|Sakaaran]] army<ref name=\"SuperheroHypePg3\" /> hunt down the Guardians when they interfere with his goals.<ref name=\"StitchKingdom\" /><ref name=\"AMCYoutube\" /> Describing Ronan, Gunn said, \"He is the primary villain, and he is a really twisted guy, he has a really religious bent in this film. He has a very sick and twisted view of what morality is; strength is virtue and weakness is sin and that is what he lives by, and I think he is very scary because of his beliefs, which are real to him.\"<ref name=\"DigitalSpy\" /> Pace, who originally auditioned for Peter Quill,<ref name=\"2012DecPace\" /> described Ronan as a \"psycho\" and a \"monster\".<ref name=\"PaceOctober2013\" />\n* [[Michael Rooker]] as [[Yondu|Yondu Udonta]]: <br />A blue-skinned bandit who is the leader of the Ravagers and a paternal figure to Quill.<ref name=\"StitchKingdom\" /><ref name=\"2013AprilRooker\" /> Yondu helps Quill to steal the orb before Quill betrays him, leaving Yondu and the Ravagers to chase the Guardians. On the character, Rooker said, he has \"some interesting issues\u2014not a good guy, not a bad guy. There's hope and there's a heart inside Yondu.\" Gunn created the film's version of the character specifically with Rooker in mind, while borrowing the character's mohawk and use of a whistle-controlled arrow from the comics. Rooker fully committed to the role once he knew his role on the TV series ''[[The Walking Dead (TV series)|The Walking Dead]]'' would be ending.<ref name=\"RookerUSAToday\" /> Rooker's makeup took approximately four hours to apply.<ref name=\"RookerMakeup\" />\n* [[Karen Gillan]] as [[Nebula (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Nebula]]: <br />An adopted daughter of Thanos who was raised with Gamora as siblings and is a loyal lieutenant in the employ of Ronan and Thanos.<ref name=\"StitchKingdom\" /><ref name=\"SlashFilmApr2014\" /> About the character, Gillan said, \"She is the female villain of the film ... She is very sadistic and evil, but I like to think for a very valid reason.\"<ref name=\"2013NovGillan\" /> She also added, \"I think she's a really interesting character. What I like to play around with is how jealous she is. She's Gamora's sister, and there's a lot of [[sibling rivalry]]. That's the most interesting aspect to me, because jealousy can consume you and turn you bitter, and ugly. And she's a total sadist, so that's fun too.\"<ref name=\"GillanCBR\" /> Gillan researched the ancient [[Sparta]]ns, shaved off her hair, and trained for two months for the role.<ref name=\"GillanCBR\" /><ref name=\"2013JulyComicCon\" /> The character's makeup took approximately four-and-a-half hours to be applied.<ref name=\"GillanCBR\" />\n* [[Djimon Hounsou]] as [[Korath the Pursuer|Korath]]: <br />A Kree<ref name=\"SuperheroHypePg3\" /> ally of Ronan who is a feared intergalactic hunter.<ref name=\"StitchKingdom\" /> As to why he took the role Hounsou said, \"I have a four-year old son who loves superheroes from [[Spider-Man]] to [[Iron Man]] to [[Batman]]. He's got all the costumes. One day he looks at me and says 'Dad, I want to be light-skinned so I could be Spider-Man. Spider-Man has light skin.' That was sort of a shock.

I think they've been revamped recently in a fun way in the [comic] book.\"<ref name=\"2010SDCCFeige\" /> Feige reiterated that sentiment in a September 2011 issue of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'', saying, \"There's an opportunity to do a big space epic, which ''[[Thor (film)|Thor]]'' sort of hints at, in the cosmic side\" of the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]]. Feige added, should the film be made, it would feature an ensemble of characters, similar to ''[[X-Men (film series)|X-Men]]'' and ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]''.<ref name=\"2011SeptEW\" />\n\nFeige announced that the film was in active development at the 2012 San Diego Comic-Con International during the Marvel Studios panel, with an intended release date of August 1, 2014. He said the film's titular team would consist of the characters [[Peter Quill (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Star-Lord]], [[Drax the Destroyer (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Drax the Destroyer]], [[Gamora (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Gamora]], [[Groot (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Groot]], and [[Rocket (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Rocket]].<ref name=\"2012SDCCPanel\" /> Two pieces of concept art were also displayed, one of Rocket Raccoon, and one featuring the entire team.<ref name=\"2012SDCCArt\" /> In August 2012, [[James Gunn]] entered talks to direct the film, beating out other contenders, including future MCU directors [[Peyton Reed]] and the duo [[Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck]].<ref name=\"2012AugGunn\" /> ''The Avengers'' director [[Joss Whedon]], who signed a deal to creatively consult on all of the films leading up to [[Avengers: Age of Ultron|''The Avengers'' sequel]],<ref name=\"2012AugWhedon\" /> was enthusiastic about the selection of Gunn to direct, saying \"James [Gunn] is what makes me think it will work ... He is so off the wall, and so crazy, but so smart, such a craftsman and he builds from his heart. He loves the raccoon. Needs the raccoon ... He has a very twisted take on it, but it all comes from a real love for the material. It's going to be hard for [the human characters] to keep up.\"<ref name=\"2012SepWhedon\" />\n\n====Writing====\n[[Nicole Perlman]], who was enrolled in Marvel's screenwriting program in 2009,<ref name=\"Screenplay\" /> was offered several of their lesser known properties to base a screenplay on.<ref name=\"Perlman3\" /> Out of those, Perlman chose [[Dan Abnett]] and [[Andy Lanning]]'s ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (2008 team)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]'', due to her interest in space and science fiction,<ref name=\"Perlman3\" /> adding, \"I think [Marvel] were a little taken aback when I chose ''Guardians'', because there were ones that would make a lot more sense if you were a romantic-comedy writer or something like that.\" Perlman spent two years writing a draft, immersing herself in the ''Guardians'' universe, and was asked in late 2011 to create another draft, before Gunn was brought in<!--not a mistake--> in early 2012 to contribute to the script.<ref name=\"Perlman\" /> Gunn eventually rewrote the script entirely because \"it didn't work\" for him; he would use the film ''[[The Dirty Dozen]]'' as a reference to convey his ideas of the film to Marvel.<ref name=\"2014JulGunn\" /> Gunn later explained that Perlman's draft was very different from the script he used during filming, including a different story, character arcs and no [[Walkman]]; he stated, \"In Nicole's script everything is pretty different ... it's not about the same stuff. But that's how the [[Writers Guild of America, West|WGA]] works. They like first writers an awful lot.\"<ref name=\"GunnFilmDivider\" /> In August 2012, Marvel Studios hired writer Chris McCoy to rewrite Perlman's script,<ref name=\"2012AugMcCoy\" /> however, it is unclear what contribution he had to the final script, since he did not receive production credit.<ref name=\"2013JulyMarvel\" />\n\nGunn revealed that character introductions were the \"hardest scenes to crack\", with Thanos' introduction being the most difficult. He felt that \"having Thanos be in that scene was more helpful to the [MCU] than it was to ''Guardians of the Galaxy'',\" yet he still wanted Thanos in the film, without \"[belittling] the actual antagonist of the film, which is Ronan.\" To solve his dilemma, Gunn chose to have Ronan kill \"The Other\", Thanos' vizier, saying, \"I thought that was interesting, because we've had the Other, who's obviously very powerful even in comparison to [[Loki (Marvel Comics)|Loki]], and then we see Ronan wipe his ass with him. So that I liked, but even that was sort of difficult, because it played as funnier when I first wrote it, and the humor didn't work so much.\"<ref name=\"GunnVultureThanos\" />\n\n===Pre-production===\nIn September 2012, Gunn confirmed that he had signed on to direct the film and rewrite the script.<ref name=\"2012SepGunn\" /> By the end of November, [[Joel Edgerton]], [[Jack Huston]], [[Jim Sturgess]], and [[Eddie Redmayne]] signed deals to test for the role of [[Peter Quill (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Peter Quill]], as did [[Lee Pace]],<ref name=\"2012NovTestDeals\" /> which he confirmed a week later in early December.<ref name=\"2012DecPace\" /> Other actors who were considered for the role included ''[[Thor: The Dark World]]''{{'}}s [[Zachary Levi]],<ref name=\"2012Dec21Quill\" /> [[Joseph Gordon-Levitt]],<ref name=\"2013JanJGL\" /> [[Michael Rosenbaum]],<ref name=\"2013JanRosenbaum\" /> and [[John Gallagher Jr.]]<ref name=\"GallagherStarLord\" /> [[Chris Pratt]] was cast in the role in February 2013, as part of a multi-film deal that he signed with Marvel.<ref name=\"HuffingtonPostNov2013\" /><ref name=\"2013FebPratt\" />\n\n[[File:James Gunn by Gage Skidmore.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Gunn promoting the film at the 2013 [[San Diego Comic-Con]]]]\nIn January 2013, filming was scheduled to take place at [[Shepperton Studios]] in London, United Kingdom,<ref name=\"2013JanShepperton\" /> and Marvel Studios announced that the film would be released in [[3D film|3D]].<ref name=\"2013Jan3D\" /> Victoria Alonso, an executive producer on the film, said that filming would begin in June. She also said that both Rocket Raccoon and Groot would be created through a combination of CGI and motion capture, going on to say that \"You can't do any motion capture with a raccoon\u2014they won't let you put the suit on. But we will do [[rotoscoping|rotomation]], probably, for some of the behavior ... we definitely will have performers to emulate what James Gunn will lead to be, the behavior and the performance. He's very clear on where he wants to take the characters.\"<ref name=\"2013FebAlonso\" /> In March 2013, Feige discussed ''Guardians of the Galaxy'' in relation to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, saying, \"It's much more of a [[Sequel#Stand-alone sequels|standalone]] film. It takes place in the same universe. And when we've been on the other side of that universe in other movies, you might see those characteristics in Guardians, but the Avengers are not involved with what's happening out there at this time.\" Feige also stated that 95% of the film would take place in space.<ref name=\"2013MarchSFX\" /> In mid-March, [[Dave Bautista]] was signed to play [[Drax the Destroyer (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Drax the Destroyer]].<ref name=\"2013MarchBautista\" /> Other actors who had been considered for the role included [[Isaiah Mustafa]], [[Brian Patrick Wade]], and [[Jason Momoa]].<ref name=\"2013MarchBautista\" /> By the following week, sculptor [[Brian Muir (sculptor)|Brian Muir]], who sculpted [[Darth Vader]]'s mask for the ''[[Star Wars]]'' films, was revealed to be working on the film.<ref name=\"2013MarchMuir\" />\n\nIn early April 2013, [[Zoe Saldana]] entered into negotiations to star as [[Gamora (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Gamora]] in the film, and it was confirmed she had been cast later that month.<ref name=\"2013AprilLovibond\" /><ref name=\"2013AprilSaldana\" /> Also in April, [[Michael Rooker]] joined the film's cast as [[Yondu]],<ref name=\"2013AprilRooker\" /> and it was announced that [[Ophelia Lovibond]] had been cast in a supporting role.<ref name=\"2013AprilLovibond\" /> By this point in time, [[Lee Pace]] was in final negotiations to play the villain of the film.<ref name=\"2013AprilPace\" /> In May, Marvel offered [[John C.

White said, \"James always pushed for practical and makeup effects. He wanted, like me, to see the real deal there on set.\" White was careful not to use \"modern\" creature designs to ensure they did not fall short in Gunn's uniquely envisioned world. White and his team created upwards of 1,000 prosthetic makeup applications and 2,000 molds of different-colored aliens.<ref name=\"WhiteMakeup\" /> For the specific aesthetic look to the film, Gunn wanted to create \"a colorful science-fiction world\", and include elements of 1950s and '60s pulp movies, citing the Ravagers' spaceships, which he compared to muscle cars, as an example of the latter.<ref name=\"GunnDesign\" /> Science fiction artist [[Chris Foss]] inspired and helped design the final look of some of the spacecrafts that appear in the film.<ref name=\"ChrisFoss\" /> The ''[[Mass Effect]]'' video game series, [[Flash Gordon]], ''[[Farscape]]'', and ''[[Star Wars]]'' were primary inspirations for Gunn on the film.<ref name=\"GunnInspirations\" />\n\n===Filming===\nPrincipal photography began around July 6, 2013 in [[London]], United Kingdom,<ref name=\"2013JulyComicCon\" /> under the working title of ''Full Tilt''.<ref name=\"SuperheroHypePg1\" /> Filming took place at Shepperton Studios and [[Longcross Studios]].<ref name=\"2013JanShepperton\" /><ref name=\"DavisInterview\" /> Later in July, Gunn and the film's cast flew from London to attend San Diego Comic-Con International, where it was revealed that Pace would play Ronan the Accuser, Gillan would be [[Nebula (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Nebula]], del Toro as [[Collector (comics)|The Collector]], and that [[Djimon Hounsou]] had been cast as [[Korath the Pursuer|Korath]].<ref name=\"2013JulyComicCon\" /><ref name=\"2013JulyMarvel\" /> Close was later revealed to play [[Nova Corps#Known members|Nova Prime Irani Rael]].<ref name=\"StitchKingdom\" /><ref name=\"2013JulyMarvel\" /> Also at San Diego Comic-Con, Feige stated that Thanos would be a part of the film as the \"mastermind\".<ref name=\"2013JulyFeige\" /> On August 11, 2013, filming began at London's [[Millennium Bridge, London|Millennium Bridge]],<ref name=\"Entertainmentwise\" /> which was selected as a double for [[Xandar]].<ref name=\"CBRSetVisit\" /> In August 2013, Marvel announced that [[Bradley Cooper]] would voice Rocket.<ref name=\"CooperOfficial\" /> On September 3, 2013, Gunn said that filming was \"a little over half[way]\" complete.<ref name=\"2013SeptMTV\" /> Also in September, [[Vin Diesel]] stated that he was voicing Groot.<ref name=\"DieselConfirm\" /> However, Marvel did not confirm Diesel's involvement in the film at the time.<ref name=\"RocketStandIn\" /><ref name=\"2013NovDelToro\" /><ref name=\"HuffingtonPostOct2013\" /> On October 12, 2013, Gunn announced on social media that filming had completed.<ref name=\"FilmingEnding\" />\n\n[[Director of photography]] [[Ben Davis (cinematographer)|Ben Davis]] used [[Arri Alexa#Alexa XT|Arri Alexa XT]] cameras for the film, saying, \"I'm traditionally a photochemical fan, but going with the digital format was the right way for this movie ... the Alexa [provided] the right look for this particular film.\" During the opening scenes in the 1980s, Davis chose JDC Cooke Xtal (Crystal) Express anamorphic prime lenses because they \"had more anamorphic artifacts and aberrations, which [he] felt added something.\" Davis used spherical [[Panavision]] Primos for the rest of the film. Additionally, Davis worked closely with production designer Charles Wood in order to achieve the correct lighting looks for each scene.<ref name=\"DavisInterview\" /> Dealing with two fully CGI characters forced Davis to shoot scenes multiple times, usually once with the references for the characters and once without them in the shot.<ref name=\"DavisInterview2\" />\n\nGunn revealed that his brother, Sean Gunn, took on multiple roles during the filming process, such as standing in for Rocket, which he noted was beneficial for the other actors, including Saldana, Pratt, and Bautista, who responded positively to Sean and his on-set performances.<ref name=\"SeanGunnThanos\" /> Special effects makeup designer David White made two life-size versions of Rocket and a bust of Groot as aids for visual effects, with White saying, \"it gives [the filmmakers] a good indication of where visual effects needs to pick up and whether Rocket can actually reach certain things or use certain devices.\"<ref name=\"RocketGrootBI\" /> These busts were also used to see how the on-set lighting would affect the characters, to assist with the visual effects lighting process.<ref name=\"RocketGrootBI\" />\n\nIn January 2015, Disney revealed that the film came in \"slightly over the agreed budget\" at $232.3 million, with Disney receiving a rebate of $36.4 million from the British government.<ref name=\"ActualBudget\" /> It was previously estimated to have had a $170 million budget.<ref name=\"Tracking\" />\n\n===Post-production===\nIn November 2013, Gunn stated that he attempted to use as many practical effects as possible while filming to aid the use of CGI and motion capture during post-production, saying, \"Our sets are enormous. We have a prison that is 350,000 pounds of steel. Anybody who knows me knows I love the mix of practical and CGI effects ... I can't wait for people to see it, because it's astonishingly beautiful.\"<ref name=\"GunnEffects\" /> After the release of ''[[Thor: The Dark World]]'', Feige stated that the [[Infinity Gems|Infinity Stones]] would be a focus in the film, as well as going forward into the Phase Three slate of films within the MCU.<ref name=\"InfinityStones\" /> In a separate interview for ''The Dark World'' in November, Feige added that a third, unknown Infinity Stone would be seen in the film,<ref name=\"SlashFilmNov2013\" /> referred to as the \"Power Stone\" by the Collector.<ref name=\"VultureThanos\" /><ref name=\"IBPowerStone\" /> The [[mid-credits scene]] in ''The Dark World'' revealed Lovibond's role as the Collector's slave, later named Carina.<ref name=\"2014AprilLovibond\" /> In December 2013, Marvel confirmed that Diesel would voice Groot.<ref name=\"DieselMarvelOfficial\" />\n\nA few weeks of additional filming, involving the film's main cast and crew, occurred in March 2014 at [[Walt Disney Studios (Burbank)|Walt Disney Studios]] in [[Burbank, California]].<ref name=\"GunnAddnlFilming\" /><ref name=\"GunnAddnlFilming2\" /><ref name=\"SaldanaAddnlFilming\" /> In April 2014, Gunn described Thanos as the \"head of the snake\" in the film, and confirmed he would appear via performance capture.<ref name=\"SlashFilmApr2014\" /> In May 2014, Gunn stated that the film features an \"enormous\" amount of smaller and minor characters from the Marvel Universe, adding that he felt the film had the most characters overall of any Marvel Studios film to date.<ref name=\"IGNMay2014\" /> Costume supervisor Dan Grace added to this by saying, \"We really, really get the feeling of the scale and scope of the galaxy. We visit five planets, we see a hundred different races.\" The film introduces the alien race [[Planet Hulk|Sakaaran]], who act as Ronan's mercenaries, as a replacement to the [[Badoon]], as the Badoon film rights belonged to [[20th Century Fox]].<ref name=\"SuperheroHypePg3\" />\n\nBy the end of May, [[Josh Brolin]] was revealed as the voice of Thanos,<ref name=\"ThanosCast\" /><ref name=\"BrolinThanos\" /> with Feige confirming in July that Brolin also provided the performance capture for the character.<ref name=\"BrolinPerformance\" /> Thanos communicates via hologram for much of the film, though he does appear in a scene with Ronan and Nebula.<ref name=\"VultureThanos\" /> In June 2014, Feige added that Thanos and his followers are \"the biggest piece of connective tissue that will eventually lead us back into ''Avengers'' films in the future.\"<ref name=\"FeigeTotalFilm\" /> On casting Brolin, Feige said,\n\n<blockquote>We reached out to him and it was one of those things that does not happen all the time but when it does it's very nice, where he was totally intrigued. He was a fan of what we did, he met with Jeremy Latcham in a hotel in London and learned about the characters a little bit. I spoke to him on the phone a few times. We ran it by James who loved it, ran it by Joss [Whedon] who loved it because Thanos is in this universe because of ''Avengers''. Then we shot him and recorded for it.<ref name=\"BrolinPerformance\" /></blockquote>\n\nOn July 7, 2014, Gunn announced on social media that he had completed work on the film.<ref name=\"GotGComplete\" /> In August, regarding the post-credit scene, Gunn revealed that the scene did not involve [[Howard the Duck]] when it was originally filmed, rather he was added during post-production,<ref name=\"GunnHowardDuck\" /> a decision made by \"some combination of [Gunn] and the editor Fred Raskin\".<ref name=\"Corlett\" /> As the decision to add the character was made late in the post-production process, he had to be designed that day, before being handed off to Sony Pictures Imageworks to animate. Also in August, regarding the pre-credit scene of Baby Groot dancing, Gunn stated that he himself danced to provide motion reference for the animators, and that the decision was made to place the scene before the credits, rather than during or after them, because of positive responses from a test audience, which made Marvel and Gunn feel that they did not want \"people walking out and missing this thing\".<ref name=\"Corlett\" /> Marvel used design firm Sarofsky once again for the film's title sequences, after liking their work for ''[[Captain America: The Winter Soldier]]''. Sarofsky developed a custom [[typeface]] based on the font used in the teaser posters for the opening credits, which was tinted orange to offer a better contrast to the film's blue and grey imagery. One of the typography solutions offered before the final product wound up being repurposed as the locator cards seen throughout the film.<ref name=\"Sarofsky\" />\n\n====Visual effects====\n{{multiple image\n<!-- Essential parameters -->\n|align     = right\n|direction = vertical\n|footer            = The [[Gardens by the Bay]] (top) in [[Singapore]] helped inspire the look of the planet Xandar (bottom).<ref name=\"FXGuide\" />\n|width     = 200\n\n<!-- Image 1 -->\n|image1    = Gardens by the Bay South viewed from Sands Sky Park, Marina Bay Sands Hotel, Singapore.jpg\n|width1    =\n\n<!-- Image 2 -->\n|image2    = Xandar.jpg\n|width2    = \n}}\n\nThe film featured 2,750 visual effects shots,<ref name=\"VFXShots\" /> which make up approximately 90% of the film.<ref name=\"FXGuide\" /> The visual effects were created by: [[Moving Picture Company]] (MPC), who worked on creating Groot, as well as Morag, Xandar, the ''Dark Aster'' and the final battle on Xandar;<ref name=\"FXGuide\" /> [[Framestore]], who worked on creating Rocket, extending the Kyln prison set and constructing Knowhere;<ref name=\"FXGuide\" /><ref name=\"FramestoreRocket\" /> [[Luma Pictures]], who worked on Thanos;<ref name=\"FXGuide\" /> [[Method Studios]], who worked on creating the Orb opening and revealing its powers, as well as the holographic displays at the Nova Corps command center;<ref name=\"FXGuide\" /> Lola VFX; Cantina Creative; [[Sony Pictures Imageworks]], who worked on Howard the Duck and creating the ''Dark Aster'' shots with MPC;<ref name=\"Corlett\" /><ref name=\"FXGuide\" /> CoSA VFX; Secret Lab; Rise Visual Effects Studios; and Technicolor VFX.<ref name=\"VarietyReview\" /><ref name=\"MethodVFX\" /> Pre- and post-visualizations were done by Proof and The Third Floor, with Proof also contributing to the creation of Rocket and Groot.<ref name=\"FXGuide\" />\n\nProducer Nik Korda noted how helpful it was to have Sean Gunn and Krystian Godlewski portray Rocket and Groot on set, as it provided references for lighting and on-set performances to the animators.<ref name=\"RocketGrootBI\" /> When creating Groot, MPC realized early on that his eyes would be essential in maintaining the character's human qualities, as his face couldn't move in the way that humans' do. MPC visual effects supervisor Nicolas Aithadi explained that, \"When you look at humans what makes the eyes interesting is the imperfections\u2014trying to make these two irises not aimed at the same place\u2014trying to make them strange and look more human.\"<ref name=\"FXGuide\" /> Textures for Groot came from a number of sources, including inspiration from a botanical garden in London, and the character was modeled as individual branches, rigged individually, to simulate a muscle system for the character.<ref name=\"FXGuide\" />\n\nOne of the major challenges for Framestore in creating Rocket was his fur. Framestore's Rachel Williams explained that, since \"raccoon fur is made up from a layer of short fine hair and a layer of longer thicker hairs\", these layers were separated and animated individually, removing the need to use \"guide hairs\" to control the movements of thick sections of fur.<ref name=\"FXGuide\" /> Framestore and MPC worked closely sharing assets, to ensure shots of Rocket at MPC would match the Rocket created by Framestore, and vice versa for when Groot was needed by the other studio.<ref name=\"FXGuide\" />\n\nIn order to give Thanos \"the performance and the weight that he deserved\", Luma Pictures created a new facial animation system to re-create Josh Brolin as a fully CG character, using his \"eyes, some of his cheek, how his muscles move when he talks\". The character's large jaw, and the deep groves that run down his face, had \"to be carefully planned out with the movement of his face.\"<ref name=\"FXGuide\" />\n\n==Music==\n{{main|Guardians of the Galaxy (soundtrack)}}\nIn August 2013, Gunn revealed that [[Tyler Bates]] would be composing the film's score. Gunn stated that Bates would write some of the score first so that he can film to the music, as opposed to scoring to the film.<ref name=\"Bates\" /> In February 2014, Gunn revealed that the film would incorporate songs from the 1960s and 1970s, such as \"[[Hooked on a Feeling]]\", on a mixtape in Quill's [[Walkman]], which acts as a way for him to stay connected to the Earth, home, and family he lost.<ref name=\"TotalFilmTrailer6\" /> In May 2014, Gunn added that using the songs from the '60s and '70s were \"cultural reference points\", saying, \"It's striking the balance throughout the whole movie, through something that is very unique, but also something that is easily accessible to people at the same time. The music and the Earth stuff is one of those touchstones that we have to remind us that, yeah, [Quill] is a real person from planet Earth who's just like you and me. Except that he's in this big outer space adventure.\"<ref name=\"IGNMay2014\" />\n\nWhen choosing the songs, Gunn revealed he \"started the process by reading the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' charts for all of the top hits of the '70s\", downloading \"a few hundred\" songs that were \"semi-familiar\u2014ones you recognize but might not be able to name off the top of your head\" and creating a playlist for all the songs that would fit the film tonally. He added that he \"would listen to the playlist on my speakers around the house\u2014sometimes I would be inspired to create a scene around a song, and other times I had a scene that needed music and I would listen through the playlist, visualizing various songs, figuring out which would work the best.\"<ref name=\"VultureMusic\" /> Most of the songs were played on set to help \"the actors and the camera operators find the perfect groove for the shot\", with [[David Bowie]]'s \"[[Moonage Daydream]]\" the only song chosen and added during post-production. Gunn also said that the opening scenes were designed with \"Hooked on a Feeling\" in mind; however, once Gunn discovered \"[[Come and Get Your Love]]\", the song used in the sequence, Gunn felt it was a \"better fit.\"<ref name=\"VultureMusic\" />\n\nThree albums were released by [[Hollywood Records]] on July 29, 2014: The film's score, ''Guardians of the Galaxy (Original Score)'', which features the music composed by Bates for the film;<ref name=\"Score\" /> ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (soundtrack)|Guardians of the Galaxy: Awesome Mix Vol. 1 (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack)]]'', which comprises the twelve songs from Quill's mixtape; and a deluxe edition featuring both albums.<ref name=\"Soundtracks\" /> By August 2014, the album which mirrored Quill's mixtape had reached the top of the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart, becoming the first soundtrack album in history consisting entirely of previously released songs to top the chart.<ref name=\"AwesomeMixChart\" /> Hollywood Records also released a cassette version of the ''Awesome Mix Vol. 1'' soundtrack on November 28, 2014, as an exclusive to [[Record Store Day]] participants.

''The Hollywood Reporter'' noted that the quick release of the scene from Marvel two weeks after the film's theatrical release, along with the rush announcement from Funko, indicated the popularity of both the character and the scene.<ref name=\"THRBabyGroot\" /> The scene also produced the word \"grooting\", coined by Michael Rooker, in which a person dances similar to Groot, with the word entering the social media [[lexicon]].<ref name=\"Grooting\" /> Also in August, Marvel held a special screening of the film at [[Children's Hospital Los Angeles]], where Pratt dressed as Star-Lord to entertain the patients.<ref name=\"ChildrensHospitalScreening\" />\n\n===Merchandise===\nIn June 2012, Marvel filed eleven [[trademark]] applications for ''Guardians of the Galaxy'', covering a variety of [[consumer product]]s, from [[video game]]s to [[cosmetics]].<ref name=\"2012TMApps\" /> [[Disney Consumer Products]] partnered with Mad Engine, C-Life, [[New Era Cap Company|New Era]], [[Hasbro]], Disguise, Rubies, [[Sideshow Collectibles]], [[Lego]], KIDdesigns, [[iHome]], [[Funko]], Freeze, Fast Forward, and Innovative Designs to produce merchandise for the film, with releases starting in June 2014.<ref name=\"VarietyMarketingJun2014\" /><ref name=\"2013AugVariety\" /><ref name=\"LegoSets\" /><ref name=\"LegoSets2\" /> Mad Engine and C-Life were partnered as the core apparel outfitters, producing a line of T-shirts and fleece jackets, while New Era produced headwear and hats.<ref name=\"2013AugVariety\" /> Hasbro produced toys for the film; Disguise and Rubies produced the costumes; and [[Sideshow Collectibles]] was given charge of the collectibles.<ref name=\"VarietyMarketingJun2014\" /><ref name=\"2013AugVariety\" /> Lego announced three toy sets based on scenes from the film,<ref name=\"LegoSets\" /> while iHome created character speakers, Funko made vinyl [[bobblehead]]s, Freeze crafted 1980s-inspired apparel, and backpacks and stationery were made by Fast Forward and Innovative Designs.<ref name=\"VarietyMarketingJun2014\" /> Despite first films in a potential new franchise usually being off-limits to licensees, Marvel used ''[[Iron Man (2008 film)|Iron Man]]''{{'}}s success as evidence of unknown characters becoming hits with audiences to attract partnerships. Licensees embraced Rocket as the film's potential breakout character, with Drax and Gamora being used for older demographics; Star-Lord's obsession with 1980s nostalgia, including his \"Awesome Mix Vo. 1\" cassette, has also served as a basis for tie-in products.<ref name=\"VarietyMarketingJun2014\" /> In August 2014, Funko announced a toy based on \"Dancing Groot\",<ref name=\"THRBabyGroot\" /> while in October 2014, Marvel and KID designs announced a replica of dancing Groot, for release in December 2014.<ref name=\"KIDDancingGroot\" />\n\nIn December 2014, Disney made a second marketing push, to coincide with the film's home media release with additional merchandise.

One fateful encounter brings her standing against Bollywood superstar Rishabh Kundra alias RK. She fights a case of hit and run on behalf of her friend Mukund against RK and sends him to jail. \n\nMukund proposes Madhu and they get engaged. RK insinuates that Madhu is his girlfriend and humiliates her mother Padmini and guardian Shamsher Malik\u2019s relationship. He says they are having a secret affair for the last 20 years. Mukund breaks off his engagement thinking Madhu has an affair with RK.\n\nMadhu visits RK\u2019s set and slaps him who puts forward an offer of forty lakh rupees for her father Balraj\u2019s treatment as he was badly beaten up on RK\u2019s set after he had shown up to kill RK after a public stunt. RK asks Madhu to marry him which she accepts. Rude and egotistical, RK becomes hell-bent on ruining Madhubala\u2019s life and tries to insult her in any way he can but is possessive of her.\n\nEventually, things turn normal and Madhu falls in love with RK. RK's half-brother Sikandar Bhatia's wife Deepali, who is in fact RK's ex-girlfriend had married Sikandar as he was being launched in a big-budgeted film and RK was a struggling actor at that time. She wants Madhu to leave RK but in vain. \n\nShamsher is determined to kill RK who had forcefully kept Madhu captive at his home. Unaware of the changed scenario, he shoots RK who is saved by Madhu as she donates blood to him. She witnesses a big change in her feelings for RK who too develops a soft corner for Madhu and is no longer rude to her. She brings a lot of changes in RK\u2019s life like she restores his faith in God and his relationship with his mother. \n\nMadhu teaches RK many other lessons of life and everyone is thankful to her for this. They confess their love. RK helps Padmini and Shamsher in getting married and even when Balraj abducts all but is shot to death by Padmini. RK asks Madhu to leave her family and come away with him to lead a peaceful life because he needs a break and wants to spend his time with her. \n\nMadhu blindly agrees and RK says he wants to marry her properly before leaving so that they can take their relationship forward. During the marriage, RK suddenly stops and tells he had never loved her; it was his plan to entangle her in his love and then destroy her life when he leaves her. \n\nDevastated, Madhu decides to part her ways. Everyone is furious at RK for deserting Madhu and tries to convince him to bring her back as he is nothing without her but he doesn\u2019t budge on his decision. Madhu gets a job as a hairstylist at RK\u2019s film set. He is once again rude to her and adamant to make her leave, trying to play hard but she has answers. \n\nRK regrets his decision to leave Madhu when he suspects her getting ahead with a mysterious man. He cannot stand the thought of Madhu with someone else and realizes his mistake; he decides to win her back and abducts her to forcefully make her live with him at his home. Earlier, Madhu not relents.\n\nLater, Madhu decides to play along and this time she would leave RK with help from Sultan, the mystery man who RK assumes to be Madhu's lover. She wants to teach RK a lesson and make him realize the pain of a broken heart. He is unable to accept his feelings for Madhu. Wanting her plan to succeed, Madhu leaves saying she won't come back unless he confesses his love. \n\nAs per Madhu's expectations, RK confesses his love and proposes her in front of all. Madhu agrees and the preparation for the grand wedding begins. Just a few days before the wedding, Madhu realizes she cannot execute her plan because she loves RK and cannot leave him. Sultan wants Madhu to back off because he thinks that RK will kill Madhu when he learns her evil plan.\n\nMadhu changes her mind and breaks Sultan's heart as he loves her too. Although heartbroken after learning Madhu\u2019s plan, RK decides to leave all the bad memories behind, forgive Madhubala and then officially marry her. Sultan, who hates RK for taking away Madhu, seeks revenge. He discovers being RK\u2019s half-brother and uses this as a device to humiliate him in public.\n\nSultan refers to RK as a bastard whose father Mohan had first married Meera who gave birth to Sultan. RK realizes Sultan is doing all this to win Madhu and accidentally kills him. He is sent to jail. Madhu finds out Sultan is alive and it was a plan to send RK to jail and take her away. \n\nSultan realizes RK wouldn\u2019t so easily let Madhu go and now so on tortures her to get a divorce from RK and come to him in order to save him. Helpless, Madhu agrees. Enraged, RK refuses but later connects all dots and learns that it is Sultan who is behind all this drama and forcing Madhu to divorce him. \n\nRK eventually kills Sultan with the police's help and saves Madhu. Due to his inability to shoot for movies owing to personal problems and slapping producer Amar Bahl, RK is banned from Bollywood and decides to produce his own film. Veteran director Mehul Chopra agrees to help him and chooses Madhu as the heroine but RK refuses and is actually fascinated by the idea of her being his heroine. \n\nRK finds a heroine but is dissatisfied and vows not to pressurize Madhu to sign the film. On inauguration day, the heroine is rendered unable to attend the inaugural conference by Amar Bahl and RK's stepfather Kulbhushan Bhatia who hates him. Thinking that his career is over, RK is about to commit suicide when his assistant Bittu Sharma calls and informs him Madhu has stepped in as the heroine. \n\nSuper excited, RK appears as the leading actor of his film in front of media with Madhu who marks her entry into Bollywood. He confesses in front of all that he loves Madhu and thanks to her for becoming his heroine. RK\u2019s aunt Paabo is told by a saint that Madhu is not right for him. Madhu is brainwashed by Paabo and made to perform some perilous religious tasks but later finds out it was all Paabo and Deepali\u2019s plot to oust her from RK\u2019s life.\n\nMadhu refuses to leave RK. During shooting, RK gets injured and suffers paralysis. Madhu decides to take over and complete the movie. RK develops insecurity towards her due to her rising fame and being ignored by everyone because he is handicapped. Madhu becomes pregnant but RK doesn\u2019t want a baby when he is going through a lot of trouble. This breaks Madhu\u2019s heart and she is unhappy with his wishes. \n\nThe movie \u201cIshq Ek Junoon\u201d becomes a superhit, bringing RK out of his financial and career problems. Due to stress, Madhu suffers a miscarriage and blames RK. He misunderstands her thought of becoming a superstar like him and tries his best to avert her mind from getting into the film industry. Later, everything gets all right and Madhu becomes a heroine like she was destined to be.\n\nEnters RK's doppelganger Keval Ram Kushwaha alias KRK, who is hired by Kulbhushan to avenge all the insults RK had thrown at him. Kulbhushan wants KRK to steal away all RK\u2019s money and render him bankrupt. KRK agrees to take RK\u2019s place in need of money. He is a nobleman and decides to leave RK\u2019s life when he realizes of separating him from Madhu.\n\nKRK returns back to his hometown with prize money from RK for speaking up the truth and showing decency. Kulbhushan is arrested and sent to jail. Madhu is revealed to be pregnant once again and gives birth to a girl whom RK also names Madhubala. He prophesies that she will become a superstar like her parents.\n\n===Twenty years later===\n\nRK and Madhu are dead. Their grown-up daughter Madhubala looks like just Madhu and works for Abhay Kapoor who makes her fall in love with him. They announce their marriage, but Abhay gets Madhubala married to Raja, a mentally challenged and second look-alike of RK. Abhay reveals he wanted to avenge the death of his father Harshvardhan who committed suicide after being incriminated for killing RK and Madhu. \n\nRaja turns out to be KRK's son and finally becomes a normal person. Due to his lifestyle of a gangster, Madhubala hates, insults and accuses him by crossing her all limits. She raises the question on his manhood. Angry, dejected and drunk, Raja gets doped and instigated by his brother-in-law who tells him to punish Madhubala for unnecessarily raising questions.\n\nThis leads to the raging Raja raping Madhubala who files a case against him and gets him jailed but withdraws it after some time. Raja\u2019s aunt Baiji dies. Being in jail and unable to donate blood to save her life, he thinks Madhubala is responsible for it and begins hating and torturing her. It is revealed Raja's brother-in-law plotted this to take over the family property.\n\nMadhubala gets pregnant with Raja's child and later requests him to forgive her which Raja does; they remarry and begin living separately from his family. Raja opens a garage to start earning a living. One night, a producer assumes him as RK and proposes to do a film with him that the producer had wanted to do with RK and Madhu. \n\nMadhubala reads Madhu\u2019s diary, learning that Madhu\u2019s last wish was to make a film on her and RK\u2019s life. Madhubala convinces Raja to sign the film; they start their career and appear as Madhu and RK, giving the first shot of their film. Raja states it is not the end but the beginning of a new life as they were always destined to live and be superstars together.\n\n==Cast==\n===Main===\n* [[Drashti Dhami]] as\n** Madhubala \"Madhu\" Choudhary\u2013 Padmini and Balraj's daughter, Trishna's sister, RK's wife, Madhubala's mother (2012\u20132014)\n** Madhubala Kundra\u2013 Madhu and RK's daughter, Raja's wife (2014)\n* [[Vivian Dsena]] as\n** Rishabh Kundra/ RK\u2013 Radha and Mohan's son, Sultan and Sikandar's half-brother, Madhu's husband, Madhubala's father (2012\u20132014)\n** Keval Ram Kushwaha/ KRK\u2013 Jugnu's brother, Kulbhushan's accomplice, Raja and Abhimanyu's father (2013\u20132014)\n** Raja Kushwaha/ Raj Kumar/ Raju\u2013 KRK's son, Abhimanyu's brother, Madhubala's husband (2014)\n* [[Spandan Chaturvedi]] as Young Madhubala Kundra (2014)\n\n===Recurring=== \n* [[Pallavi Purohit]] as Padmini Shekhari\u2013 Balraj's ex-wife, Madhu and Trishna's mother, Shamsher's wife, Madhubala's maternal grandmother\n* [[Aarti Puri]] as Trishna Chaudhary\u2013 Padmini and Balraj's daughter, Madhu's sister, Madhubala's sororal aunt\n* Shama Deshpande as Radha Upadhyay\u2013 Mohan's widowed/second wife, Kulbhushan's wife, RK and Sikandar's mother, Madhubala's paternal grandmother\n* [[Raza Murad]] as Kulbhushan Bhatia/ Kukku\u2013 Radha's second husband, Sikandar's father\n* [[Sikandar Kharbanda]] as Sikandar Bhatia\u2013 Radha and Kulbhushan's son, RK's half-brother, Deepali's husband\n* Seema Mishra as Deepali Singh\u2013 RK's ex-girlfriend, Sikandar's wife\n* [[Navneet Nishan]]/Seema Kapoor as Pabbo\u2013 RK's paternal aunt\n* [[Avinesh Rekhi]] as Sultan Kundra\u2013 Meera and Mohan's son, RK's half-brother, Madhu's obsessive lover\n* [[Siddharth Vasudev]] as Bhujang Shastri\n* [[Zarina Wahab]] as Meera Malik\u2013 Mohan's ex-wife, Sultan's mother\n* Kannan Arunachalam as Rashid Baig\u2013 Mohan's ex-driver\n* [[Raj Zutshi]] as Balraj Choudhary\u2013 Padmini's ex-husband, Madhu and Trishna's father, Madhubala's maternal grandfather\n* [[Shagufta Ali]] as Badi Chaudhrain\n* [[Lalit Parimoo]] as Guruji\n* [[Sushmita Mukherjee]] as Dai Maa\n* Indresh Malik as Bittu Sharma\u2013 RK's personal secretary, Leela's husband\n* [[Rakhee Tandon (actress)|Rakhee Tandon]] as Roma Malik\u2013 Shamsher's sister,\n* [[Bhupinder Singh (actor)|Bhupinder Singh]] as Shamsher Malik\u2013 Roma's brother, Padmini's second husband, Madhu and Trishna's stepfather\n* [[Prashant Chawla]] as Sunny Sharma\n* Swati Anand as Leelavati Agashey/ Leela\u2013 Bittu's wife\n* Shweta Vyal/[[Tanvi Thakkar]] as Sweety Sharma\n* [[Vaishnavi Dhanraj]] as Riya\n* [[Manini Mishra]] as Ila\n* [[Usha Nadkarni]] as Sonali Devi\u2013 Mukund and Swati's mother\n* [[Manish Naggdev]] as Mukund Dixit\u2013 Sonali's son; Swati's brother; Madhu's ex-fianc\u00e9\n* [[Ahsaas Channa]] as Swati Dixit\u2013 Sonali's daughter; Mukund's sister\n* [[Anita Hassanandani]] as Sanya\n* [[Vinay Apte]] as Shivdutt Marathe \n* [[Neelu Kohli]] as Harjeet Kaur\u2013 Harshvardhan and Umesh's mother; Abhay and Ananya's grandmother\n* [[Arbaaz Ali Khan]] as [[Film director|Director]] Harshvardhan Kapoor\u2013 Harjeet's son; Umesh's brother; Mohini's husband; Abhay and Ananya's father\n* [[Deepshikha Nagpal]] as Mohini Verma\u2013 Harshvardhan's wife; Abhay and Ananya's mother\n* Puneet Sachdev as Nikhil Lamba\u2013 Ananya's husband\n* [[Kishwer Merchant]] as Ananya Kapoor\u2013 Mohini and Harshvardhan's daughter; Abhay's sister; Nikhil's wife\n* Gunjan Utreja as Abhay Kapoor\u2013 Harshvardhan and Mohini's son; Ananya's brother; Madhubala's ex-fianc\u00e9; Aisha's husband\n* Rajesh Balwani as Umesh Kapoor\u2013 Harjeet's son; Harshvardhan's brother; Dolly's husband; Abhay and Ananya's paternal uncle\n* [[Utkarsha Naik]] as Dolly Kaur Singh\u2013 Umesh's wife; Abhay and Ananya's paternal aunt\n* [[Fenil Umrigar]] as Aisha Dande\u2013 Abhay's wife\n* Ravi Khanvilkar as Jugnesh Ram Kushwaha/ Jugnu\u2013 KRK's brother; Raja and Abhimanyu's paternal uncle; Baiji's husband; Agni's father\n* [[Shoaib Ibrahim]] as Abhimanyu Kushwaha\u2013 KRK's son; Raja's brother\n* [[Shraddha Jaiswal]] as Agni Kushwaha\u2013 Baiji and Jugnu's daughter; Raja and Abhimanyu's paternal cousin\n* [[Shalini Arora]]/[[Jaya Bhattacharya]] as Baiji Devi\u2013 Jugnu's wife; Raja and Abhimanyu's paternal aunt; Agni's mother\n* [[Shital Thakkar]] as Tara\n* Jaswant Menaria as Bhanu Pratap Singh\n* Pooja Sahu as Faguni Kushwaha\n* [[Neha Pendse]] as Priya\n\n==Broadcast==\nThe show has several versions including dubs and remakes  in the following Indian languages and other languages:\n{|class =\"wikitable \n\n\n!

One fateful encounter brings her standing against Bollywood superstar Rishabh Kundra alias RK. She fights a case of hit and run on behalf of her friend Mukund against RK and sends him to jail. \n\nMukund proposes Madhu and they get engaged. RK insinuates that Madhu is his girlfriend and humiliates her mother Padmini and guardian Shamsher Malik\u2019s relationship. He says they are having a secret affair for the last 20 years. Mukund breaks off his engagement thinking Madhu has an affair with RK.\n\nMadhu visits RK\u2019s set and slaps him who puts forward an offer of forty lakh rupees for her father Balraj\u2019s treatment as he was badly beaten up on RK\u2019s set after he had shown up to kill RK after a public stunt. RK asks Madhu to marry him which she accepts. Rude and egotistical, RK becomes hell-bent on ruining Madhubala\u2019s life and tries to insult her in any way he can but is possessive of her.\n\nEventually, things turn normal and Madhu falls in love with RK. RK's half-brother Sikandar Bhatia's wife Deepali, who is in fact RK's ex-girlfriend had married Sikandar as he was being launched in a big-budgeted film and RK was a struggling actor at that time. She wants Madhu to leave RK but in vain. \n\nShamsher is determined to kill RK who had forcefully kept Madhu captive at his home. Unaware of the changed scenario, he shoots RK who is saved by Madhu as she donates blood to him. She witnesses a big change in her feelings for RK who too develops a soft corner for Madhu and is no longer rude to her. She brings a lot of changes in RK\u2019s life like she restores his faith in God and his relationship with his mother. \n\nMadhu teaches RK many other lessons of life and everyone is thankful to her for this. They confess their love. RK helps Padmini and Shamsher in getting married and even when Balraj abducts all but is shot to death by Padmini. RK asks Madhu to leave her family and come away with him to lead a peaceful life because he needs a break and wants to spend his time with her. \n\nMadhu blindly agrees and RK says he wants to marry her properly before leaving so that they can take their relationship forward. During the marriage, RK suddenly stops and tells he had never loved her; it was his plan to entangle her in his love and then destroy her life when he leaves her. \n\nDevastated, Madhu decides to part her ways. Everyone is furious at RK for deserting Madhu and tries to convince him to bring her back as he is nothing without her but he doesn\u2019t budge on his decision. Madhu gets a job as a hairstylist at RK\u2019s film set. He is once again rude to her and adamant to make her leave, trying to play hard but she has answers. \n\nRK regrets his decision to leave Madhu when he suspects her getting ahead with a mysterious man. He cannot stand the thought of Madhu with someone else and realizes his mistake; he decides to win her back and abducts her to forcefully make her live with him at his home. Earlier, Madhu not relents.\n\nLater, Madhu decides to play along and this time she would leave RK with help from Sultan, the mystery man who RK assumes to be Madhu's lover. She wants to teach RK a lesson and make him realize the pain of a broken heart. He is unable to accept his feelings for Madhu. Wanting her plan to succeed, Madhu leaves saying she won't come back unless he confesses his love. \n\nAs per Madhu's expectations, RK confesses his love and proposes her in front of all. Madhu agrees and the preparation for the grand wedding begins. Just a few days before the wedding, Madhu realizes she cannot execute her plan because she loves RK and cannot leave him. Sultan wants Madhu to back off because he thinks that RK will kill Madhu when he learns her evil plan.\n\nMadhu changes her mind and breaks Sultan's heart as he loves her too. Although heartbroken after learning Madhu\u2019s plan, RK decides to leave all the bad memories behind, forgive Madhubala and then officially marry her. Sultan, who hates RK for taking away Madhu, seeks revenge. He discovers being RK\u2019s half-brother and uses this as a device to humiliate him in public.\n\nSultan refers to RK as a bastard whose father Mohan had first married Meera who gave birth to Sultan. RK realizes Sultan is doing all this to win Madhu and accidentally kills him. He is sent to jail. Madhu finds out Sultan is alive and it was a plan to send RK to jail and take her away. \n\nSultan realizes RK wouldn\u2019t so easily let Madhu go and now so on tortures her to get a divorce from RK and come to him in order to save him. Helpless, Madhu agrees. Enraged, RK refuses but later connects all dots and learns that it is Sultan who is behind all this drama and forcing Madhu to divorce him. \n\nRK eventually kills Sultan with the police's help and saves Madhu. Due to his inability to shoot for movies owing to personal problems and slapping producer Amar Bahl, RK is banned from Bollywood and decides to produce his own film. Veteran director Mehul Chopra agrees to help him and chooses Madhu as the heroine but RK refuses and is actually fascinated by the idea of her being his heroine. \n\nRK finds a heroine but is dissatisfied and vows not to pressurize Madhu to sign the film. On inauguration day, the heroine is rendered unable to attend the inaugural conference by Amar Bahl and RK's stepfather Kulbhushan Bhatia who hates him. Thinking that his career is over, RK is about to commit suicide when his assistant Bittu Sharma calls and informs him Madhu has stepped in as the heroine. \n\nSuper excited, RK appears as the leading actor of his film in front of media with Madhu who marks her entry into Bollywood. He confesses in front of all that he loves Madhu and thanks to her for becoming his heroine. RK\u2019s aunt Paabo is told by a saint that Madhu is not right for him. Madhu is brainwashed by Paabo and made to perform some perilous religious tasks but later finds out it was all Paabo and Deepali\u2019s plot to oust her from RK\u2019s life.\n\nMadhu refuses to leave RK. During shooting, RK gets injured and suffers paralysis. Madhu decides to take over and complete the movie. RK develops insecurity towards her due to her rising fame and being ignored by everyone because he is handicapped. Madhu becomes pregnant but RK doesn\u2019t want a baby when he is going through a lot of trouble. This breaks Madhu\u2019s heart and she is unhappy with his wishes. \n\nThe movie \u201cIshq Ek Junoon\u201d becomes a superhit, bringing RK out of his financial and career problems. Due to stress, Madhu suffers a miscarriage and blames RK. He misunderstands her thought of becoming a superstar like him and tries his best to avert her mind from getting into the film industry. Later, everything gets all right and Madhu becomes a heroine like she was destined to be.\n\nEnters RK's doppelganger Keval Ram Kushwaha alias KRK, who is hired by Kulbhushan to avenge all the insults RK had thrown at him. Kulbhushan wants KRK to steal away all RK\u2019s money and render him bankrupt. KRK agrees to take RK\u2019s place in need of money. He is a nobleman and decides to leave RK\u2019s life when he realizes of separating him from Madhu.\n\nKRK returns back to his hometown with prize money from RK for speaking up the truth and showing decency. Kulbhushan is arrested and sent to jail. Madhu is revealed to be pregnant once again and gives birth to a girl whom RK also names Madhubala. He prophesies that she will become a superstar like her parents.\n\n===Twenty years later===\n\nRK and Madhu are dead. Their grown-up daughter Madhubala looks like just Madhu and works for Abhay Kapoor who makes her fall in love with him. They announce their marriage, but Abhay gets Madhubala married to Raja, a mentally challenged and second look-alike of RK. Abhay reveals he wanted to avenge the death of his father Harshvardhan who committed suicide after being incriminated for killing RK and Madhu. \n\nRaja turns out to be KRK's son and finally becomes a normal person. Due to his lifestyle of a gangster, Madhubala hates, insults and accuses him by crossing her all limits. She raises the question on his manhood. Angry, dejected and drunk, Raja gets doped and instigated by his brother-in-law who tells him to punish Madhubala for unnecessarily raising questions.\n\nThis leads to the raging Raja raping Madhubala who files a case against him and gets him jailed but withdraws it after some time. Raja\u2019s aunt Baiji dies. Being in jail and unable to donate blood to save her life, he thinks Madhubala is responsible for it and begins hating and torturing her. It is revealed Raja's brother-in-law plotted this to take over the family property.\n\nMadhubala gets pregnant with Raja's child and later requests him to forgive her which Raja does; they remarry and begin living separately from his family. Raja opens a garage to start earning a living. One night, a producer assumes him as RK and proposes to do a film with him that the producer had wanted to do with RK and Madhu. \n\nMadhubala reads Madhu\u2019s diary, learning that Madhu\u2019s last wish was to make a film on her and RK\u2019s life. Madhubala convinces Raja to sign the film; they start their career and appear as Madhu and RK, giving the first shot of their film. Raja states it is not the end but the beginning of a new life as they were always destined to live and be superstars together.\n\n==Cast==\n===Main===\n* [[Drashti Dhami]] as\n** Madhubala \"Madhu\" Choudhary\u2013 Padmini and Balraj's daughter, Trishna's sister, RK's wife, Madhubala's mother (2012\u20132014)\n** Madhubala Kundra\u2013 Madhu and RK's daughter, Raja's wife (2014)\n* [[Vivian Dsena]] as\n** Rishabh Kundra/ RK\u2013 Radha and Mohan's son, Sultan and Sikandar's half-brother, Madhu's husband, Madhubala's father (2012\u20132014)\n** Keval Ram Kushwaha/ KRK\u2013 Jugnu's brother, Kulbhushan's accomplice, Raja and Abhimanyu's father (2013\u20132014)\n** Raja Kushwaha/ Raj Kumar/ Raju\u2013 KRK's son, Abhimanyu's brother, Madhubala's husband (2014)\n* [[Spandan Chaturvedi]] as Young Madhubala Kundra (2014)\n\n===Recurring=== \n* [[Pallavi Purohit]] as Padmini Shekhari\u2013 Balraj's ex-wife, Madhu and Trishna's mother, Shamsher's wife, Madhubala's maternal grandmother\n* [[Aarti Puri]] as Trishna Chaudhary\u2013 Padmini and Balraj's daughter, Madhu's sister, Madhubala's sororal aunt\n* Shama Deshpande as Radha Upadhyay\u2013 Mohan's widowed/second wife, Kulbhushan's wife, RK and Sikandar's mother, Madhubala's paternal grandmother\n* [[Raza Murad]] as Kulbhushan Bhatia/ Kukku\u2013 Radha's second husband, Sikandar's father\n* [[Sikandar Kharbanda]] as Sikandar Bhatia\u2013 Radha and Kulbhushan's son, RK's half-brother, Deepali's husband\n* Seema Mishra as Deepali Singh\u2013 RK's ex-girlfriend, Sikandar's wife\n* [[Navneet Nishan]]/Seema Kapoor as Pabbo\u2013 RK's paternal aunt\n* [[Avinesh Rekhi]] as Sultan Kundra\u2013 Meera and Mohan's son, RK's half-brother, Madhu's obsessive lover\n* [[Siddharth Vasudev]] as Bhujang Shastri\n* [[Zarina Wahab]] as Meera Malik\u2013 Mohan's ex-wife, Sultan's mother\n* Kannan Arunachalam as Rashid Baig\u2013 Mohan's ex-driver\n* [[Raj Zutshi]] as Balraj Choudhary\u2013 Padmini's ex-husband, Madhu and Trishna's father, Madhubala's maternal grandfather\n* [[Shagufta Ali]] as Badi Chaudhrain\n* [[Lalit Parimoo]] as Guruji\n* [[Sushmita Mukherjee]] as Dai Maa\n* Indresh Malik as Bittu Sharma\u2013 RK's personal secretary, Leela's husband\n* [[Rakhee Tandon (actress)|Rakhee Tandon]] as Roma Malik\u2013 Shamsher's sister,\n* [[Bhupinder Singh (actor)|Bhupinder Singh]] as Shamsher Malik\u2013 Roma's brother, Padmini's second husband, Madhu and Trishna's stepfather\n* [[Prashant Chawla]] as Sunny Sharma\n* Swati Anand as Leelavati Agashey/ Leela\u2013 Bittu's wife\n* Shweta Vyal/[[Tanvi Thakkar]] as Sweety Sharma\n* [[Vaishnavi Dhanraj]] as Riya\n* [[Manini Mishra]] as Ila\n* [[Usha Nadkarni]] as Sonali Devi\u2013 Mukund and Swati's mother\n* [[Manish Naggdev]] as Mukund Dixit\u2013 Sonali's son; Swati's brother; Madhu's ex-fianc\u00e9\n* [[Ahsaas Channa]] as Swati Dixit\u2013 Sonali's daughter; Mukund's sister\n* [[Anita Hassanandani]] as Sanya\n* [[Vinay Apte]] as Shivdutt Marathe \n* [[Neelu Kohli]] as Harjeet Kaur\u2013 Harshvardhan and Umesh's mother; Abhay and Ananya's grandmother\n* [[Arbaaz Ali Khan]] as [[Film director|Director]] Harshvardhan Kapoor\u2013 Harjeet's son; Umesh's brother; Mohini's husband; Abhay and Ananya's father\n* [[Deepshikha Nagpal]] as Mohini Verma\u2013 Harshvardhan's wife; Abhay and Ananya's mother\n* Puneet Sachdev as Nikhil Lamba\u2013 Ananya's husband\n* [[Kishwer Merchant]] as Ananya Kapoor\u2013 Mohini and Harshvardhan's daughter; Abhay's sister; Nikhil's wife\n* Gunjan Utreja as Abhay Kapoor\u2013 Harshvardhan and Mohini's son; Ananya's brother; Madhubala's ex-fianc\u00e9; Aisha's husband\n* Rajesh Balwani as Umesh Kapoor\u2013 Harjeet's son; Harshvardhan's brother; Dolly's husband; Abhay and Ananya's paternal uncle\n* [[Utkarsha Naik]] as Dolly Kaur Singh\u2013 Umesh's wife; Abhay and Ananya's paternal aunt\n* [[Fenil Umrigar]] as Aisha Dande\u2013 Abhay's wife\n* Ravi Khanvilkar as Jugnesh Ram Kushwaha/ Jugnu\u2013 KRK's brother; Raja and Abhimanyu's paternal uncle; Baiji's husband; Agni's father\n* [[Shoaib Ibrahim]] as Abhimanyu Kushwaha\u2013 KRK's son; Raja's brother\n* [[Shraddha Jaiswal]] as Agni Kushwaha\u2013 Baiji and Jugnu's daughter; Raja and Abhimanyu's paternal cousin\n* [[Shalini Arora]]/[[Jaya Bhattacharya]] as Baiji Devi\u2013 Jugnu's wife; Raja and Abhimanyu's paternal aunt; Agni's mother\n* [[Shital Thakkar]] as Tara\n* Jaswant Menaria as Bhanu Pratap Singh\n* Pooja Sahu as Faguni Kushwaha\n* [[Neha Pendse]] as Priya\n\n==Broadcast==\nThe show has several versions including dubs and remakes  in the following Indian languages and other languages:\n{|class =\"wikitable \n\n\n!

The A-side usually featured the recording that the artist, record producer, or the record company intended to receive the initial promotional effort and then receive radio airplay, hopefully, to become a [[hit record|\"hit\" record]]. The B-side (or \"flip-side\") is a secondary recording that has a history of its own: some artists released B-sides that were considered as strong as, or stronger than, the A-side and became hits in their own right. Others took the opposite approach: producer [[Phil Spector]] was in the habit of filling B-sides with on-the-spot instrumentals that no one would confuse with the A-side. With this practice, Spector was assured that airplay was focused on the side he wanted to be the hit side.\n\nMusic recordings have moved away from records onto other formats such as [[Compact Disc single|CDs]] and [[music download|digital downloads]], which do not have \"sides\", but the terms are still used to describe the type of content, with B-side sometimes standing for \"bonus\" track.<ref>{{cite book|title=B-Sides, Undercurrents and Overtones: Peripheries to Popular in Music, 1960 to the Present|first=Professor George|last=Plasketes|publisher=Ashgate Publishing|date=January 28, 2013}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe first sound recordings at the end of the 19th century were made on [[phonograph cylinder|cylinder records]], which had a single round surface capable of holding approximately two minutes of sound. Early shellac [[disc record]]s records only had recordings on one side of the disc, with a similar capacity (both media could hold between three and four minutes by 1910). Double-sided recordings, with one selection on each side, were introduced in Europe by [[Columbia Records]] in 1908, and by 1910 most record labels had adopted the format in both Europe and the United States; the ability to effectively double the amount of sound on the disc was one major factor in its rising to dominance over the cylinder record which was obsolete by 1912.\n\nThere were no [[record charts]] until the 1930s, and radio stations (by and large) did not play recorded music until the 1950s (when [[top 40]] radio overtook [[Old-time radio#Legacy|full-service network radio]]). In this time, A-sides and B-sides existed, but neither side was considered more important; the \"side\" did not convey anything about the content of the record.\n\nIn June 1948, Columbia Records introduced the modern 33{{frac|1|3}} rpm [[LP album|long-playing (LP)]] microgroove [[gramophone record|vinyl]] record for commercial sales, and its rival [[RCA Victor]], responded the next year with the seven-inch 45 rpm vinylite record, which would quickly replace the 78 for single record releases. The term [[single (music)|\"single\"]] came into popular use with the advent of vinyl records in the early 1950s. At first, most record labels would randomly assign which song would be an A-side and which would be a B-side. (All records have specific identifiers for each side in addition to the catalog number for the record itself; the \"A\" side would typically be assigned a sequentially lower number.) Under this random system, many artists had so-called \"double-sided hits\", where both songs on a record made one of the national sales charts (in ''[[Billboard magazine|Billboard]]'', ''[[Cashbox (magazine)|Cashbox]]'', or other magazines), or would be featured on [[jukebox]]es in public places.\n\nAs time wore on, however, the convention for assigning songs to sides of the record changed. By the early sixties, the song on the A-side was the song that the record company wanted radio stations to play, as 45 rpm single records (or '45s') dominated the market in terms of cash sales. It was not until 1968, for example, that the total production of albums on a unit basis finally surpassed that of singles in the United Kingdom.<ref>MacDonald, p. 296</ref> In the late 1960s, stereo versions of pop and rock songs began to regularly appear on 45s. The majority of the 45s were played on AM radio stations, which were not equipped for stereo broadcast at the time, so stereo was not a priority. However, the FM rock stations did not like to play monaural content, so the record companies adopted a protocol for DJ versions with the mono version of the song on one side, and stereo version of the same song on the other.\n\nBy the early 1970s, double-sided hits had become rare. Album sales had increased, and B-sides had become the side of the record where non-album, non-radio-friendly, instrumental versions or simply inferior recordings were placed. In order to further ensure that radio stations played the side that the record companies had chosen, it was common for the promotional copies (DJ version) of a single to have the \"plug side\" on both sides of the disc.\n\nWith the decline of 45 rpm vinyl records, after the introduction of [[compact audio cassette|cassette]] and compact disc singles in the late 1980s, the A-side/B-side differentiation became much less meaningful. At first, cassette singles would often have one song on each side of the cassette, matching the arrangement of vinyl records, but eventually, cassette [[maxi-single]]s, containing more than two songs, became more popular. Cassette singles were phased out beginning in the late 1990s, and the A-side/B-side dichotomy became virtually extinct, as the remaining dominant medium, the compact disc, lacked an equivalent physical distinction. However, the term \"B-side\" is still used to refer to the \"[[bonus track|bonus]]\" tracks or \"coupling\" tracks on a CD single.\n\nWith the advent of downloading music via the Internet, sales of CD singles and other physical media have declined, and the term \"B-side\" is now less commonly used. Songs that were not part of an artist's collection of albums are made available through the same downloadable catalogs as tracks from their albums, and are usually referred to as \"unreleased\", \"bonus\", \"non-album\", \"rare\", \"outtakes\" or \"exclusive\" tracks, the latter in the case of a song being available solely from a certain provider of music.\n\n==Significance==\nB-side songs may be released on the same record as a single to provide extra \"value for money\". There are several types of material commonly released in this way, including a different version (e.g., instrumental, [[a cappella]], [[live album|live]], [[acoustic instrument|acoustic]], [[remix]]ed version or in another language), or, in a [[Concept album|concept record]], a song that does not fit into the story line.{{citation needed|using a song on the B-side because it doesn't fit into the storyline of a concept LP is conjecture. Examples and/or references are needed to back up this assertion. date=May 2016|date=May 2016}}\n\nAdditionally, it was common in the 1960s and 1970s for longer songs, especially by soul, funk, and R&B acts, to be broken into two parts for single release. Examples of this include [[Ray Charles]]'s \"[[What'd I Say]]\", [[the Isley Brothers]]' \"[[Shout (The Isley Brothers song)|Shout]]\", and a number of records by [[James Brown]], including \"[[Papa's Got a Brand New Bag]]\" and \"[[Say It Loud - I'm Black and I'm Proud]]\". Typically, \"part one\" would be the chart hit, while \"part two\" would be a continuation of the same performance. A notable example of a non-R&B hit with two parts was the single release of [[Don McLean]]'s \"[[American Pie (song)|American Pie]]\". With the advent of the 12in single in the late 1970s, the part one/part two method of recording was largely abandoned. Modern day examples are Fall Out Boy's EP, My Heart Will Always Be The B-Side To My Tongue, or My Chemical Romance's The Black Parade, The B-Sides\n\nSince both sides of a single received equal [[royalties]], some composers deliberately arranged for their songs to be used as the B-sides of singles by popular artists. This became known as the \"flipside racket\".{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}} Similarly, it has also been alleged that owners of [[pirate radio]] stations operating off the British coast in the 1960s would buy the publishing rights to the B-sides of records they expected to be hits, and then plug the A-sides in the hope of driving up sales and increasing their share of the royalties.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n\nOccasionally, the B-side of a single would become the more popular song. This sometimes occurred because a DJ preferred the B-side to its A-side and played it instead. Some examples include \"[[I Will Survive]]\" by [[Gloria Gaynor]] (originally the B-side of \"Substitute\"), \n\"[[Ice Ice Baby]]\" by [[Vanilla Ice]] (originally the B-side of \"[[Play_That_Funky_Music#Vanilla_Ice_version|Play That Funky Music]]\"), \"[[I'll Be Around (The Spinners song)|I'll Be Around]]\" by [[The Spinners (American band)|the Spinners]] (originally the B-side of \"[[How Could I Let You Get Away]]\") and \"[[Maggie May]]\" by [[Rod Stewart]] (originally the B-side of \"[[Reason to Believe]]\"). Probably the most well-known of these, however, is \"[[Rock Around the Clock]]\" by [[Bill Haley & His Comets]] (originally the B-side of \"Thirteen Women (And Only One Man In Town))\".\n\nThe song \"[[How Soon Is Now?]]\" by [[the Smiths]] started out as the extra track on the 12-inch of ''[[William, It Was Really Nothing]]'' but later gained a separate release as an A-side in its own right, as did [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]]'s \"[[Acquiesce]]\", which originally appeared as a B-side to \"[[Some Might Say]]\" in 1995, but gained subsequent release in 2006 as part of an EP to promote their forthcoming [[greatest hits|compilation]] album, ''[[Stop the Clocks]]''. [[Feeder (band)|Feeder]] in 2001 and 2005 had the B-sides \"Just a Day\" from \"Seven Days in the Sun\", and \"Shatter\" from \"[[Tumble and Fall (Feeder song)|Tumble and Fall]]\" released as A-sides after fan petitions and official website and fansite message board hype, and both charted at No. 12 and No. 11 in the UK. In 1986, the first single from [[XTC]]'s record ''[[Skylarking]]'', \"Grass\", was eclipsed in the United States by its B-side, \"[[Dear God (XTC song)|Dear God]]\" \u2013 so much so that the record was almost immediately re-released with one song (\"Mermaid Smiled\") removed and \"Dear God\" put in its place, becoming one of the band's better-known hits.\n\nOn many reissued singles, the A- and B-sides are two hit songs from different albums that were not originally released together, or were by completely different artists, altogether. These were often made for the [[jukebox]], as one record with two popular songs on it would make more money, or to promote an artist to the fans of another. For example, in 1981 [[Kraftwerk]] released their new single \"[[Computer Love (Kraftwerk song)|Computer Love]]\" coupled with the B-side \"[[The Model]]\", from their 1978 [[Long Play|LP]] ''[[The Man-Machine]]''. With [[synthpop]] increasingly dominating the UK charts, the single was re-released with the sides reversed. In early 1982 \"The Model\" reached number one.\n\n==Double A-side==\nA \"double A-side\" is a single where both sides are designated the A-side; there is no B-side on such a single.  In 1949, [[Savoy Records]] promoted a new single by one of its artists, [[Paul Williams (saxophonist)|Paul Williams]]' \"House Rocker\" and \"He Knows How to Hucklebuck\", as \"The New Double Side Hit \u2013 Both Sides \"A\" Sides\".<ref>\n{{cite magazine\n| author = Billboard\n| date = June 25, 1949\n| title = Rhythm & Blues Records\n| magazine = [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]\n| volume = 61\n| issue = 26\n| quote = \"Savoy and Paul Williams Lead Again with{{nbsp}}...

Other groups followed suit, notably [[the Rolling Stones]] in early 1967 with \"[[Let's Spend the Night Together]]\" / \"[[Ruby Tuesday (song)|Ruby Tuesday]]\" as a double-A single.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\nA double A-sided single is often confused with a single where both sides, the A and the B, became hits. Although many artists in the late 1950s and early 1960s like [[Elvis Presley]], [[the Everly Brothers]], [[Fats Domino]], [[Ricky Nelson]], [[the Beach Boys]], [[Brenda Lee]], and [[Pat Boone]], routinely had hit singles where both sides of the 45 received airplay, these were not double A-sides. The charts below tally the instances for artists' singles where both sides were hits, not where both sides were designated an A-side upon manufacture and release. For instance \"[[Don't Be Cruel]]\", the B-side of \"[[Hound Dog (song)|Hound Dog]]\" by Elvis Presley, became as big a hit as its A-side even though \"Don't Be Cruel\" was not the intended A-side when released in 1956. Reissues later in the 1960s (and after the Beatles' \"Day Tripper\"/\"We Can Work It Out\") listed the single with both songs as the A-side. Also, for [[Cliff Richard]]'s 1962 \"[[The Next Time]]\"/\"[[Bachelor Boy]]\", both sides were marketed as songs with chart potential, albeit with \"Bachelor Boy\" pressed as the B-side.\n\nIn the UK, before the advent of digital downloads, both A-sides were accredited with the same chart position, as the singles' chart was compiled entirely from physical sales. In the UK, the biggest-selling non-charity single of all time was a double A-side, [[Wings (band)|Wings]]' 1977 release \"[[Mull of Kintyre (song)|Mull of Kintyre]]\"/\"[[Girls' School (song)|Girls' School]]\", which sold over two million copies. It was also the [[List of UK Singles Chart Christmas number ones|UK Christmas No. 1]] that year, one of only two occasions on which a double A-side has topped that chart, the other being [[Queen (band)|Queen's]] 1991 re-release of \"[[Bohemian Rhapsody]]\" with \"[[These Are the Days of Our Lives]]\".<ref name=\"UK Official Chart 2011\">[http://www.theofficialcharts.com/archive-chart/_/1/1977-12-24/ 1977-12-24 Top 40 Official UK Singles Archive | Official Charts<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]] released \"[[All Apologies]]\" and \"[[Rape Me]]\" as a double A-side in 1993, and both songs are accredited as a hit on both the UK Singles Chart,<ref>[http://www.officialcharts.com/artist/_/nirvana/ Nirvana \u2013 UK Singles Chart Archive] officialcharts.com.

Retrieved October 23, 2013.</ref>\n\nQueen released their first double-A single, \"[[Killer Queen]]\"/\"[[Flick of the Wrist]]\", in 1974. \"Killer Queen\" became a hit, while \"Flick of the Wrist\" was all but ignored for lack of promotion. Three years later, they released \"[[We Are the Champions]]\" with \"[[We Will Rock You]]\" as a B-side. Both sides of the single received much radio airplay (often one after the other), which led to them sometimes being referred to as a double A-side. In 1978 they released \"[[Fat Bottomed Girls]]\"/\"[[Bicycle Race]]\" as a double A-side; that time both sides of the single became hits.\n\nOccasionally double-A-sided singles were released with each side targeting a different market. During the late 1970s, for example, [[Dolly Parton]] released a number of double-A-sided singles, in which one side was released to pop radio, and the other side to country, including \"[[Two Doors Down]]\"/\"[[It's All Wrong, But It's All Right]]\" and \"[[Baby I'm Burning]]\"/\"[[I Really Got the Feeling]]\". In 1978, the [[Bee Gees]] also used this method when they released \"[[Too Much Heaven]]\" for the pop market and the flip side, \"[[Rest Your Love on Me]]\", which was aimed toward country stations.\n\nMany artists continue to release double A-sided singles outside of the US where it is seen as more popular. Examples of this include Oasis's \"[[Little by Little (Oasis song)|Little by Little]]\"/\"[[She Is Love]]\" (2002), [[Bloc Party]]'s [[So Here We Are/Positive Tension|\"So Here We Are\"/\"Positive Tension\"]] (2005) and [[Gorillaz]]'s [[El Ma\u00f1ana (song)|\"El Ma\u00f1ana\"]]/\"[[Kids with Guns]]\" (2006).\n\nArtists having the most US double-sided singles on which each side charted in the [[Billboard Hot 100|US Hot 100]], according to ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'':<ref name=\"Whitburn, Joel 2006\">Whitburn, Joel, Top Pop Singles 1955\u20132006, Record Research Inc., 2007</ref>\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!

When such singles were introduced in the 1970s, the popular term for them was \"[[maxi single]]\", though this term is now used more ambiguously for a variety of formats. For some people these records would not quite qualify as EPs, for those generally have four songs on a 45.\n\n[[Genesis (band)|Genesis]]'s 1978 7-inch single \"Many Too Many\" featured two B-sides, \"The Day the Light Went Out\" and \"Vancouver\", both of them being outtakes from the ''[[...And Then There Were Three...]]'' album. There was no 12-inch equivalent. The band released two 7-inch singles with three tracks apiece, ''Spot the Pigeon'' and ''3X3'' (also known as \"Paperlate\"), which were explicitly marked as EPs. \"Spot the Pigeon\" was also available in a 12-inch version, and also subverted this format a bit, by having two tracks on the A-side and one track on the B-side. The B-side, \"Inside and Out\", was also considered the selling point of the EP, being Steve Hackett's last contribution to the band, and remains a favorite of many fans.\n\n[[Paul McCartney]]'s 1980 single \"[[Coming Up (song)|Coming Up]]\" had a studio version of the song on the A-side, while the B-side contained two songs, a live version of \"Coming Up\" and a studio instrumental called \"[[Lunchbox/Odd Sox]]\".\n\n[[Iron Maiden]]'s 1980 7-inch single \"[[Sanctuary (Iron Maiden song)|Sanctuary]]\" was a re-recording of a song that had been given for use on the ''Metal For Muthas'' compilation the previous year. The recording was made during the ''[[Iron Maiden (album)|Iron Maiden]]'' sessions but was left off the UK version of that album, and was then put out as a single. To help compensate fans who had specifically bought ''Metal for Muthas'' for the track, the \"Sanctuary\" single had two live B-sides which were deliberately selected to be non-album tracks\u2014\"[[I Got the Fire|I've Got The Fire]]\" (a cover of the [[Montrose (band)|Montrose]] song) and \"Drifter\". A studio recording of \"Drifter\" (featuring [[Adrian Smith]] instead of [[Dennis Stratton]]) appeared on their next album, ''[[Killers (Iron Maiden album)|Killers]]'', and a studio version of \"I've Got The Fire\" featuring [[Bruce Dickinson]] appeared on the B-side of \"[[Flight of Icarus]]\" a few years later. At the time this single was released they were the first live Iron Maiden tracks released (though more would follow), and it remains the only officially released recording of \"I've Got The Fire\" with [[Paul Di'Anno]] on vocals.\n\nThe singles from [[U2]]'s album ''[[The Joshua Tree]]'' were released with two B-side songs each, which were pressed at 33{{frac|1|3}} rpm. Versions for jukeboxes included only one of those songs, which played at 45 rpm.\n\nThe UK 7-inch single of \"[[Love Shack]]\" by [[The B-52's]] was released with live versions of \"[[Planet Claire]]\" and \"[[Rock Lobster]]\" on the B-side, which plays at 33{{frac|1|3}} rpm. The follow-up \"[[Roam (song)|Roam]]\" followed suit, including live versions of \"Whammy Kiss\" and \"Dance This Mess Around\" on the B-side playing at 33{{frac|1|3}} rpm.\n\n[[The Rolling Stones]] released \"[[Brown Sugar (The Rolling Stones song)|Brown Sugar]]\" from their album ''[[Sticky Fingers]]'' in May 1971. While the American single featured only \"[[Bitch (The Rolling Stones song)|Bitch]]\" as the B-side, the British single added a third track, a live rendition of \"[[Let It Rock (Chuck Berry song)|Let It Rock]]\" (the [[Chuck Berry]] classic) recorded at the [[University of Leeds]] during their 1971 tour of the UK.\n\n==Humorous implementations==\nThe concept of the B-side has become so well known that many performers have released parody versions, including:\n* The 1988 single \"[[Stutter Rap (No Sleep til Bedtime)]]\" by parody band [[Morris Minor and the Majors]] featured a B-side titled \"Another Boring 'B'-side\".\n* Parody band [[Bad News (band)|Bad News]] recorded a video B-side for the VHS version of their single \"[[Bohemian Rhapsody]]\", titled \"Every Mistake Imaginable\", in which the band discusses that they have to record an extra three minutes of footage for the single to be eligible for the charts.\n* [[Tracey Ullman]]'s hit \"[[They Don't Know (Kirsty MacColl song)|They Don't Know]]\" was backed in the UK by a song entitled \"The B Side\" and featured Ullman in a variety of comic monologues, many of which bemoaned the uselessness of B-sides. (The US release used the album's title track, \"You Broke My Heart in 17 Places\", as the B-side.)\n* Paul and [[Linda McCartney]]'s B-side to Linda McCartney's \"[[Seaside Woman]]\" (released under the alias Suzy and the Red Stripes) was a song called \"B-Side to Seaside\".\n* The single \"O.K.?\", from the [[Rock Follies of '77 (soundtrack)|soundtrack album]] of the TV series ''[[Rock Follies of '77]]'', contained a song called \"B-Side?\" which featured [[Charlotte Cornwell]] tunelessly singing about the fact that she is not considered good enough to sing an A-side.\n* The B-side of the single \"[[They're Coming to Take Me Away, Ha-Haaa!]]\" by [[Napoleon XIV]] was called \"!aaaH-aH, yawA eM ekaT oT gnimoC er'yehT\" and the singer billed as \"Noelopan VIX\". It was the A-side played in reverse; in fact, most of the label affixed to that B-side was a mirror image of the front label (as opposed to being spelled backwards), including the letters in the \"WB\" shield logo.\n* [[Blotto (band)|Blotto]]'s 1981 single \"When the Second Feature Starts\" features \"The B-Side\", a song about how bad B-sides are compared to A-sides.\n* [[Love and Rockets (band)|Love and Rockets]]' novelty side project [[the Bubblemen]] released only one single in 1988, \"The Bubblemen Are Coming\" coupled with \"The B-Side\", which is a field recording of bees.\n* The [[Wall of Voodoo]] 1982 12-inch EP ''Two Songs by Wall of Voodoo'' has the 10-minute joke track \"There's Nothing on This Side\" on the B-side.\n* [[Metric (band)|Metric]] released in 2008 a single entitled \"Help, I'm Alive\", with a B-side \"Help, I'm a B-Side\".\n* [[Three Dog Night]]'s 1973 single \"[[Shambala (song)|Shambala]]\" featured \"Our 'B' Side\", about the group wishing it could be trusted to write their own songs for single release. It is the only Three Dog Night single written and produced by the whole group, and features family members on background vocals.\n* [[Dickie Goodman]]'s 1974 release \"[[Energy Crisis '74]]\" featured \"The Mistake\" as the B-side, which was simply a false start of the A-side, with Goodman saying, \"Mr. President, the crisis...\", followed by two minutes of silence. (It was literally a mistake: the intended B-side was an instrumental called \"Ruthie's Theme\".<ref>It was typical of Goodman's records to feature throwaway tunes on the reverse, often with different names. In fact, \"Ruthie's Theme\" is the same tune as \"Problems\", which appears on the B-side of the Goodman-produced \"Super Fly Meets Shaft\" by John and Ernest.</ref> However, when Goodman realized the factory had stamped a number of the botched pressings, he simply placed the full version of \"Energy Crisis '74\" on the other side, and released the records anyway.)\n* The [[Pearl Harbor and the Explosions]] song \"You Got It\" was backed by \"Busy Little B Side\", also found on the Warner Bros. two-LP [[Warner/Reprise Loss Leaders|sampler]], ''Troublemakers''.\n* The B-side of [[B. A. Robertson]]'s 1979 single \"Goosebumps\" is entitled \"The B-Side\" and contains lyrics from the song's point of view. The lyrics describe the song as being \"the back of a hit\" and \"real popular after the war\", which can be said to relate to the dominance of the 45 rpm single after World War II, and the change of significance of the A-side and the B-side after this time. This track also opens side two of Robertson's album ''Initial Success''.\n* One of the B-sides from Lenny Kravitz's single \"[[Heaven Help]]\" is called \"B Side Blues\" and documents the sheer boredom of him being under a lot of pressure from his record company to write more successful material. \n* [[Kaiser Chiefs]] released a 7-inch single of \"[[You Can Have It All]]\" that featured a blank B-side. Parodying their hit record ''[[I Predict A Riot]]'', the label on this blank side suggested it contained the track \"I Predict Some Quiet\".\n* The B-side of [[George Harrison]]'s \"[[Dark Horse (George Harrison song)|Dark Horse]]\", \"[[I_Don't_Care_Anymore_(George_Harrison_song)|I Don't Care Any More]]\", starts with a recitative marking the casual nature of the performance, reflected in Harrison's spoken introduction before the first verse: \"OK, here we go, fellas / We got a B-side to make, ladies and gentlemen so we better get on with it.\"\n*The cassette release of [[In God We Trust, Inc.]] by the [[Dead Kennedys]] featured a blank B-side, the entire album being on Side A. Printed on Side B was the explanation \"[[Home Taping Is Killing Music|Home taping is killing record industry profits!]]  We left this side blank so you can help.\"<ref>{{cite web|author=sharky_p2p|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/24760522@N08/2466252899/ |title=kennedys &#124; Flickr - Photo Sharing! |publisher=Flickr |date= |accessdate=2020-03-29}}</ref>\n\n== {{anchor|backed_with}} B/W ==\n{{Redirect|b/w|the shortened form of \"black and white\"|black-and-white|other uses|B&W (disambiguation){{!}}B&W}}\nThe term \"b/w\", an abbreviation of \"backed with\", is often used in listings to indicate the B-side of a record.

The A-side usually featured the recording that the artist, record producer, or the record company intended to receive the initial promotional effort and then receive radio airplay, hopefully, to become a [[hit record|\"hit\" record]]. The B-side (or \"flip-side\") is a secondary recording that has a history of its own: some artists released B-sides that were considered as strong as, or stronger than, the A-side and became hits in their own right. Others took the opposite approach: producer [[Phil Spector]] was in the habit of filling B-sides with on-the-spot instrumentals that no one would confuse with the A-side. With this practice, Spector was assured that airplay was focused on the side he wanted to be the hit side.\n\nMusic recordings have moved away from records onto other formats such as [[Compact Disc single|CDs]] and [[music download|digital downloads]], which do not have \"sides\", but the terms are still used to describe the type of content, with B-side sometimes standing for \"bonus\" track.<ref>{{cite book|title=B-Sides, Undercurrents and Overtones: Peripheries to Popular in Music, 1960 to the Present|first=Professor George|last=Plasketes|publisher=Ashgate Publishing|date=January 28, 2013}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe first sound recordings at the end of the 19th century were made on [[phonograph cylinder|cylinder records]], which had a single round surface capable of holding approximately two minutes of sound. Early shellac [[disc record]]s records only had recordings on one side of the disc, with a similar capacity (both media could hold between three and four minutes by 1910). Double-sided recordings, with one selection on each side, were introduced in Europe by [[Columbia Records]] in 1908, and by 1910 most record labels had adopted the format in both Europe and the United States; the ability to effectively double the amount of sound on the disc was one major factor in its rising to dominance over the cylinder record which was obsolete by 1912.\n\nThere were no [[record charts]] until the 1930s, and radio stations (by and large) did not play recorded music until the 1950s (when [[top 40]] radio overtook [[Old-time radio#Legacy|full-service network radio]]). In this time, A-sides and B-sides existed, but neither side was considered more important; the \"side\" did not convey anything about the content of the record.\n\nIn June 1948, Columbia Records introduced the modern 33{{frac|1|3}} rpm [[LP album|long-playing (LP)]] microgroove [[gramophone record|vinyl]] record for commercial sales, and its rival [[RCA Victor]], responded the next year with the seven-inch 45 rpm vinylite record, which would quickly replace the 78 for single record releases. The term [[single (music)|\"single\"]] came into popular use with the advent of vinyl records in the early 1950s. At first, most record labels would randomly assign which song would be an A-side and which would be a B-side. (All records have specific identifiers for each side in addition to the catalog number for the record itself; the \"A\" side would typically be assigned a sequentially lower number.) Under this random system, many artists had so-called \"double-sided hits\", where both songs on a record made one of the national sales charts (in ''[[Billboard magazine|Billboard]]'', ''[[Cashbox (magazine)|Cashbox]]'', or other magazines), or would be featured on [[jukebox]]es in public places.\n\nAs time wore on, however, the convention for assigning songs to sides of the record changed. By the early sixties, the song on the A-side was the song that the record company wanted radio stations to play, as 45 rpm single records (or '45s') dominated the market in terms of cash sales. It was not until 1968, for example, that the total production of albums on a unit basis finally surpassed that of singles in the United Kingdom.<ref>MacDonald, p. 296</ref> In the late 1960s, stereo versions of pop and rock songs began to regularly appear on 45s. The majority of the 45s were played on AM radio stations, which were not equipped for stereo broadcast at the time, so stereo was not a priority. However, the FM rock stations did not like to play monaural content, so the record companies adopted a protocol for DJ versions with the mono version of the song on one side, and stereo version of the same song on the other.\n\nBy the early 1970s, double-sided hits had become rare. Album sales had increased, and B-sides had become the side of the record where non-album, non-radio-friendly, instrumental versions or simply inferior recordings were placed. In order to further ensure that radio stations played the side that the record companies had chosen, it was common for the promotional copies (DJ version) of a single to have the \"plug side\" on both sides of the disc.\n\nWith the decline of 45 rpm vinyl records, after the introduction of [[compact audio cassette|cassette]] and compact disc singles in the late 1980s, the A-side/B-side differentiation became much less meaningful. At first, cassette singles would often have one song on each side of the cassette, matching the arrangement of vinyl records, but eventually, cassette [[maxi-single]]s, containing more than two songs, became more popular. Cassette singles were phased out beginning in the late 1990s, and the A-side/B-side dichotomy became virtually extinct, as the remaining dominant medium, the compact disc, lacked an equivalent physical distinction. However, the term \"B-side\" is still used to refer to the \"[[bonus track|bonus]]\" tracks or \"coupling\" tracks on a CD single.\n\nWith the advent of downloading music via the Internet, sales of CD singles and other physical media have declined, and the term \"B-side\" is now less commonly used. Songs that were not part of an artist's collection of albums are made available through the same downloadable catalogs as tracks from their albums, and are usually referred to as \"unreleased\", \"bonus\", \"non-album\", \"rare\", \"outtakes\" or \"exclusive\" tracks, the latter in the case of a song being available solely from a certain provider of music.\n\n==Significance==\nB-side songs may be released on the same record as a single to provide extra \"value for money\". There are several types of material commonly released in this way, including a different version (e.g., instrumental, [[a cappella]], [[live album|live]], [[acoustic instrument|acoustic]], [[remix]]ed version or in another language), or, in a [[Concept album|concept record]], a song that does not fit into the story line.{{citation needed|using a song on the B-side because it doesn't fit into the storyline of a concept LP is conjecture. Examples and/or references are needed to back up this assertion. date=May 2016|date=May 2016}}\n\nAdditionally, it was common in the 1960s and 1970s for longer songs, especially by soul, funk, and R&B acts, to be broken into two parts for single release. Examples of this include [[Ray Charles]]'s \"[[What'd I Say]]\", [[the Isley Brothers]]' \"[[Shout (The Isley Brothers song)|Shout]]\", and a number of records by [[James Brown]], including \"[[Papa's Got a Brand New Bag]]\" and \"[[Say It Loud - I'm Black and I'm Proud]]\". Typically, \"part one\" would be the chart hit, while \"part two\" would be a continuation of the same performance. A notable example of a non-R&B hit with two parts was the single release of [[Don McLean]]'s \"[[American Pie (song)|American Pie]]\". With the advent of the 12in single in the late 1970s, the part one/part two method of recording was largely abandoned. Modern day examples are Fall Out Boy's EP, My Heart Will Always Be The B-Side To My Tongue, or My Chemical Romance's The Black Parade, The B-Sides\n\nSince both sides of a single received equal [[royalties]], some composers deliberately arranged for their songs to be used as the B-sides of singles by popular artists. This became known as the \"flipside racket\".{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}} Similarly, it has also been alleged that owners of [[pirate radio]] stations operating off the British coast in the 1960s would buy the publishing rights to the B-sides of records they expected to be hits, and then plug the A-sides in the hope of driving up sales and increasing their share of the royalties.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n\nOccasionally, the B-side of a single would become the more popular song. This sometimes occurred because a DJ preferred the B-side to its A-side and played it instead. Some examples include \"[[I Will Survive]]\" by [[Gloria Gaynor]] (originally the B-side of \"Substitute\"), \n\"[[Ice Ice Baby]]\" by [[Vanilla Ice]] (originally the B-side of \"[[Play_That_Funky_Music#Vanilla_Ice_version|Play That Funky Music]]\"), \"[[I'll Be Around (The Spinners song)|I'll Be Around]]\" by [[The Spinners (American band)|the Spinners]] (originally the B-side of \"[[How Could I Let You Get Away]]\") and \"[[Maggie May]]\" by [[Rod Stewart]] (originally the B-side of \"[[Reason to Believe]]\"). Probably the most well-known of these, however, is \"[[Rock Around the Clock]]\" by [[Bill Haley & His Comets]] (originally the B-side of \"Thirteen Women (And Only One Man In Town))\".\n\nThe song \"[[How Soon Is Now?]]\" by [[the Smiths]] started out as the extra track on the 12-inch of ''[[William, It Was Really Nothing]]'' but later gained a separate release as an A-side in its own right, as did [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]]'s \"[[Acquiesce]]\", which originally appeared as a B-side to \"[[Some Might Say]]\" in 1995, but gained subsequent release in 2006 as part of an EP to promote their forthcoming [[greatest hits|compilation]] album, ''[[Stop the Clocks]]''. [[Feeder (band)|Feeder]] in 2001 and 2005 had the B-sides \"Just a Day\" from \"Seven Days in the Sun\", and \"Shatter\" from \"[[Tumble and Fall (Feeder song)|Tumble and Fall]]\" released as A-sides after fan petitions and official website and fansite message board hype, and both charted at No. 12 and No. 11 in the UK. In 1986, the first single from [[XTC]]'s record ''[[Skylarking]]'', \"Grass\", was eclipsed in the United States by its B-side, \"[[Dear God (XTC song)|Dear God]]\" \u2013 so much so that the record was almost immediately re-released with one song (\"Mermaid Smiled\") removed and \"Dear God\" put in its place, becoming one of the band's better-known hits.\n\nOn many reissued singles, the A- and B-sides are two hit songs from different albums that were not originally released together, or were by completely different artists, altogether. These were often made for the [[jukebox]], as one record with two popular songs on it would make more money, or to promote an artist to the fans of another. For example, in 1981 [[Kraftwerk]] released their new single \"[[Computer Love (Kraftwerk song)|Computer Love]]\" coupled with the B-side \"[[The Model]]\", from their 1978 [[Long Play|LP]] ''[[The Man-Machine]]''. With [[synthpop]] increasingly dominating the UK charts, the single was re-released with the sides reversed. In early 1982 \"The Model\" reached number one.\n\n==Double A-side==\nA \"double A-side\" is a single where both sides are designated the A-side; there is no B-side on such a single.  In 1949, [[Savoy Records]] promoted a new single by one of its artists, [[Paul Williams (saxophonist)|Paul Williams]]' \"House Rocker\" and \"He Knows How to Hucklebuck\", as \"The New Double Side Hit \u2013 Both Sides \"A\" Sides\".<ref>\n{{cite magazine\n| author = Billboard\n| date = June 25, 1949\n| title = Rhythm & Blues Records\n| magazine = [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]\n| volume = 61\n| issue = 26\n| quote = \"Savoy and Paul Williams Lead Again with{{nbsp}}...

Other groups followed suit, notably [[the Rolling Stones]] in early 1967 with \"[[Let's Spend the Night Together]]\" / \"[[Ruby Tuesday (song)|Ruby Tuesday]]\" as a double-A single.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\nA double A-sided single is often confused with a single where both sides, the A and the B, became hits. Although many artists in the late 1950s and early 1960s like [[Elvis Presley]], [[the Everly Brothers]], [[Fats Domino]], [[Ricky Nelson]], [[the Beach Boys]], [[Brenda Lee]], and [[Pat Boone]], routinely had hit singles where both sides of the 45 received airplay, these were not double A-sides. The charts below tally the instances for artists' singles where both sides were hits, not where both sides were designated an A-side upon manufacture and release. For instance \"[[Don't Be Cruel]]\", the B-side of \"[[Hound Dog (song)|Hound Dog]]\" by Elvis Presley, became as big a hit as its A-side even though \"Don't Be Cruel\" was not the intended A-side when released in 1956. Reissues later in the 1960s (and after the Beatles' \"Day Tripper\"/\"We Can Work It Out\") listed the single with both songs as the A-side. Also, for [[Cliff Richard]]'s 1962 \"[[The Next Time]]\"/\"[[Bachelor Boy]]\", both sides were marketed as songs with chart potential, albeit with \"Bachelor Boy\" pressed as the B-side.\n\nIn the UK, before the advent of digital downloads, both A-sides were accredited with the same chart position, as the singles' chart was compiled entirely from physical sales. In the UK, the biggest-selling non-charity single of all time was a double A-side, [[Wings (band)|Wings]]' 1977 release \"[[Mull of Kintyre (song)|Mull of Kintyre]]\"/\"[[Girls' School (song)|Girls' School]]\", which sold over two million copies. It was also the [[List of UK Singles Chart Christmas number ones|UK Christmas No. 1]] that year, one of only two occasions on which a double A-side has topped that chart, the other being [[Queen (band)|Queen's]] 1991 re-release of \"[[Bohemian Rhapsody]]\" with \"[[These Are the Days of Our Lives]]\".<ref name=\"UK Official Chart 2011\">[http://www.theofficialcharts.com/archive-chart/_/1/1977-12-24/ 1977-12-24 Top 40 Official UK Singles Archive | Official Charts<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]] released \"[[All Apologies]]\" and \"[[Rape Me]]\" as a double A-side in 1993, and both songs are accredited as a hit on both the UK Singles Chart,<ref>[http://www.officialcharts.com/artist/_/nirvana/ Nirvana \u2013 UK Singles Chart Archive] officialcharts.com.

Retrieved October 23, 2013.</ref>\n\nQueen released their first double-A single, \"[[Killer Queen]]\"/\"[[Flick of the Wrist]]\", in 1974. \"Killer Queen\" became a hit, while \"Flick of the Wrist\" was all but ignored for lack of promotion. Three years later, they released \"[[We Are the Champions]]\" with \"[[We Will Rock You]]\" as a B-side. Both sides of the single received much radio airplay (often one after the other), which led to them sometimes being referred to as a double A-side. In 1978 they released \"[[Fat Bottomed Girls]]\"/\"[[Bicycle Race]]\" as a double A-side; that time both sides of the single became hits.\n\nOccasionally double-A-sided singles were released with each side targeting a different market. During the late 1970s, for example, [[Dolly Parton]] released a number of double-A-sided singles, in which one side was released to pop radio, and the other side to country, including \"[[Two Doors Down]]\"/\"[[It's All Wrong, But It's All Right]]\" and \"[[Baby I'm Burning]]\"/\"[[I Really Got the Feeling]]\". In 1978, the [[Bee Gees]] also used this method when they released \"[[Too Much Heaven]]\" for the pop market and the flip side, \"[[Rest Your Love on Me]]\", which was aimed toward country stations.\n\nMany artists continue to release double A-sided singles outside of the US where it is seen as more popular.

When such singles were introduced in the 1970s, the popular term for them was \"[[maxi single]]\", though this term is now used more ambiguously for a variety of formats. For some people these records would not quite qualify as EPs, for those generally have four songs on a 45.\n\n[[Genesis (band)|Genesis]]'s 1978 7-inch single \"Many Too Many\" featured two B-sides, \"The Day the Light Went Out\" and \"Vancouver\", both of them being outtakes from the ''[[...And Then There Were Three...]]'' album. There was no 12-inch equivalent. The band released two 7-inch singles with three tracks apiece, ''Spot the Pigeon'' and ''3X3'' (also known as \"Paperlate\"), which were explicitly marked as EPs. \"Spot the Pigeon\" was also available in a 12-inch version, and also subverted this format a bit, by having two tracks on the A-side and one track on the B-side. The B-side, \"Inside and Out\", was also considered the selling point of the EP, being Steve Hackett's last contribution to the band, and remains a favorite of many fans.\n\n[[Paul McCartney]]'s 1980 single \"[[Coming Up (song)|Coming Up]]\" had a studio version of the song on the A-side, while the B-side contained two songs, a live version of \"Coming Up\" and a studio instrumental called \"[[Lunchbox/Odd Sox]]\".\n\n[[Iron Maiden]]'s 1980 7-inch single \"[[Sanctuary (Iron Maiden song)|Sanctuary]]\" was a re-recording of a song that had been given for use on the ''Metal For Muthas'' compilation the previous year. The recording was made during the ''[[Iron Maiden (album)|Iron Maiden]]'' sessions but was left off the UK version of that album, and was then put out as a single. To help compensate fans who had specifically bought ''Metal for Muthas'' for the track, the \"Sanctuary\" single had two live B-sides which were deliberately selected to be non-album tracks\u2014\"[[I Got the Fire|I've Got The Fire]]\" (a cover of the [[Montrose (band)|Montrose]] song) and \"Drifter\". A studio recording of \"Drifter\" (featuring [[Adrian Smith]] instead of [[Dennis Stratton]]) appeared on their next album, ''[[Killers (Iron Maiden album)|Killers]]'', and a studio version of \"I've Got The Fire\" featuring [[Bruce Dickinson]] appeared on the B-side of \"[[Flight of Icarus]]\" a few years later. At the time this single was released they were the first live Iron Maiden tracks released (though more would follow), and it remains the only officially released recording of \"I've Got The Fire\" with [[Paul Di'Anno]] on vocals.\n\nThe singles from [[U2]]'s album ''[[The Joshua Tree]]'' were released with two B-side songs each, which were pressed at 33{{frac|1|3}} rpm. Versions for jukeboxes included only one of those songs, which played at 45 rpm.\n\nThe UK 7-inch single of \"[[Love Shack]]\" by [[The B-52's]] was released with live versions of \"[[Planet Claire]]\" and \"[[Rock Lobster]]\" on the B-side, which plays at 33{{frac|1|3}} rpm. The follow-up \"[[Roam (song)|Roam]]\" followed suit, including live versions of \"Whammy Kiss\" and \"Dance This Mess Around\" on the B-side playing at 33{{frac|1|3}} rpm.\n\n[[The Rolling Stones]] released \"[[Brown Sugar (The Rolling Stones song)|Brown Sugar]]\" from their album ''[[Sticky Fingers]]'' in May 1971. While the American single featured only \"[[Bitch (The Rolling Stones song)|Bitch]]\" as the B-side, the British single added a third track, a live rendition of \"[[Let It Rock (Chuck Berry song)|Let It Rock]]\" (the [[Chuck Berry]] classic) recorded at the [[University of Leeds]] during their 1971 tour of the UK.\n\n==Humorous implementations==\nThe concept of the B-side has become so well known that many performers have released parody versions, including:\n* The 1988 single \"[[Stutter Rap (No Sleep til Bedtime)]]\" by parody band [[Morris Minor and the Majors]] featured a B-side titled \"Another Boring 'B'-side\".\n* Parody band [[Bad News (band)|Bad News]] recorded a video B-side for the VHS version of their single \"[[Bohemian Rhapsody]]\", titled \"Every Mistake Imaginable\", in which the band discusses that they have to record an extra three minutes of footage for the single to be eligible for the charts.\n* [[Tracey Ullman]]'s hit \"[[They Don't Know (Kirsty MacColl song)|They Don't Know]]\" was backed in the UK by a song entitled \"The B Side\" and featured Ullman in a variety of comic monologues, many of which bemoaned the uselessness of B-sides. (The US release used the album's title track, \"You Broke My Heart in 17 Places\", as the B-side.)\n* Paul and [[Linda McCartney]]'s B-side to Linda McCartney's \"[[Seaside Woman]]\" (released under the alias Suzy and the Red Stripes) was a song called \"B-Side to Seaside\".\n* The single \"O.K.?\", from the [[Rock Follies of '77 (soundtrack)|soundtrack album]] of the TV series ''[[Rock Follies of '77]]'', contained a song called \"B-Side?\" which featured [[Charlotte Cornwell]] tunelessly singing about the fact that she is not considered good enough to sing an A-side.\n* The B-side of the single \"[[They're Coming to Take Me Away, Ha-Haaa!]]\" by [[Napoleon XIV]] was called \"!aaaH-aH, yawA eM ekaT oT gnimoC er'yehT\" and the singer billed as \"Noelopan VIX\". It was the A-side played in reverse; in fact, most of the label affixed to that B-side was a mirror image of the front label (as opposed to being spelled backwards), including the letters in the \"WB\" shield logo.\n* [[Blotto (band)|Blotto]]'s 1981 single \"When the Second Feature Starts\" features \"The B-Side\", a song about how bad B-sides are compared to A-sides.\n* [[Love and Rockets (band)|Love and Rockets]]' novelty side project [[the Bubblemen]] released only one single in 1988, \"The Bubblemen Are Coming\" coupled with \"The B-Side\", which is a field recording of bees.\n* The [[Wall of Voodoo]] 1982 12-inch EP ''Two Songs by Wall of Voodoo'' has the 10-minute joke track \"There's Nothing on This Side\" on the B-side.\n* [[Metric (band)|Metric]] released in 2008 a single entitled \"Help, I'm Alive\", with a B-side \"Help, I'm a B-Side\".\n* [[Three Dog Night]]'s 1973 single \"[[Shambala (song)|Shambala]]\" featured \"Our 'B' Side\", about the group wishing it could be trusted to write their own songs for single release. It is the only Three Dog Night single written and produced by the whole group, and features family members on background vocals.\n* [[Dickie Goodman]]'s 1974 release \"[[Energy Crisis '74]]\" featured \"The Mistake\" as the B-side, which was simply a false start of the A-side, with Goodman saying, \"Mr. President, the crisis...\", followed by two minutes of silence. (It was literally a mistake: the intended B-side was an instrumental called \"Ruthie's Theme\".<ref>It was typical of Goodman's records to feature throwaway tunes on the reverse, often with different names. In fact, \"Ruthie's Theme\" is the same tune as \"Problems\", which appears on the B-side of the Goodman-produced \"Super Fly Meets Shaft\" by John and Ernest.</ref> However, when Goodman realized the factory had stamped a number of the botched pressings, he simply placed the full version of \"Energy Crisis '74\" on the other side, and released the records anyway.)\n* The [[Pearl Harbor and the Explosions]] song \"You Got It\" was backed by \"Busy Little B Side\", also found on the Warner Bros. two-LP [[Warner/Reprise Loss Leaders|sampler]], ''Troublemakers''.\n* The B-side of [[B. A. Robertson]]'s 1979 single \"Goosebumps\" is entitled \"The B-Side\" and contains lyrics from the song's point of view. The lyrics describe the song as being \"the back of a hit\" and \"real popular after the war\", which can be said to relate to the dominance of the 45 rpm single after World War II, and the change of significance of the A-side and the B-side after this time. This track also opens side two of Robertson's album ''Initial Success''.\n* One of the B-sides from Lenny Kravitz's single \"[[Heaven Help]]\" is called \"B Side Blues\" and documents the sheer boredom of him being under a lot of pressure from his record company to write more successful material. \n* [[Kaiser Chiefs]] released a 7-inch single of \"[[You Can Have It All]]\" that featured a blank B-side. Parodying their hit record ''[[I Predict A Riot]]'', the label on this blank side suggested it contained the track \"I Predict Some Quiet\".\n* The B-side of [[George Harrison]]'s \"[[Dark Horse (George Harrison song)|Dark Horse]]\", \"[[I_Don't_Care_Anymore_(George_Harrison_song)|I Don't Care Any More]]\", starts with a recitative marking the casual nature of the performance, reflected in Harrison's spoken introduction before the first verse: \"OK, here we go, fellas / We got a B-side to make, ladies and gentlemen so we better get on with it.\"\n*The cassette release of [[In God We Trust, Inc.]] by the [[Dead Kennedys]] featured a blank B-side, the entire album being on Side A. Printed on Side B was the explanation \"[[Home Taping Is Killing Music|Home taping is killing record industry profits!]]  We left this side blank so you can help.\"<ref>{{cite web|author=sharky_p2p|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/24760522@N08/2466252899/ |title=kennedys &#124; Flickr - Photo Sharing! |publisher=Flickr |date= |accessdate=2020-03-29}}</ref>\n\n== {{anchor|backed_with}} B/W ==\n{{Redirect|b/w|the shortened form of \"black and white\"|black-and-white|other uses|B&W (disambiguation){{!}}B&W}}\nThe term \"b/w\", an abbreviation of \"backed with\", is often used in listings to indicate the B-side of a record.
