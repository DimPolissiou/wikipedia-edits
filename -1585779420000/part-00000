The resolutions demanded that compensation be granted to the dependants of those killed or injured in the agitation. The resolutions also demanded that a commission be appointed to investigate the conduct of civil and military officers during the agitation.

When he was killed another Kashmiri stood up to continue the [[Adhan]] from the verse where the [[Adhan]] had been broken. He too was martyred. A total of 22 Kashmiris were martyred trying to complete delivering the [[Adhan]]. <ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|url=http://nation.com.pk/national/14-Jul-2015/kashmir-martyrs-day-observed|title=Kashmir Martyrs Day observed|last=|first=|date=14 July 2015|work=The Nation|access-date=|via=}}</ref>\n\nThe people carried the dead and paraded through the streets of [[Srinagar]], chanting slogans against Dogra brutalities.

Demonstrations and meetings were held in sympathy with Kashmiri Muslims. The meetings adopted resolutions calling for the conferral of rights such as freedom of religion and restoration of mosques and shrines to Muslims. The resolutions demanded that compensation be granted to the dependants of those killed or injured in the agitation. The resolutions also demanded that a commission be appointed to investigate the conduct of civil and military officers during the agitation.

The Marathas  conquered several nearby states, including [[Indore]] to the west and [[Gwalior state|Gwalior]] to the north, but Bhopal remained a Muslim-ruled state under Dost Mohammed Khan's successors. Subsequently, Nawab Wazir Mohammed Khan, a general, created a truly strong state after fighting several wars.\n\nNawab Jahangir Mohammed Khan established a [[cantonment]] at a distance of one mile from the fort. This was called Jahangirabad after him. He built gardens and barracks for British guests and soldiers in Jahangirabad.\n\nIn 1778, during the [[First Anglo-Maratha War]],  when the British General Thomas Goddard campaigned across India, Bhopal was one of the few states that remained friendly to the British. In 1809, during the [[Second Anglo-Maratha War]], General Close led a British expedition to Central India. The [[Nawab of Bhopal]] petitioned in vain to be received under British protection. In 1817, when the [[Third Anglo-Maratha War]] broke out, a treaty of dependence was signed between the British Government of India and the Nawab of Bhopal. Bhopal remained a friend of British Government during the [[British Raj]] in India.\n\nIn February\u2013March 1818, Bhopal became a [[princely state]] in [[British India]] as a result of the Anglo-Bhopal treaty between the East India Company and Nawab Nazar Muhammad (Nawab of Bhopal during 1816\u20131819). Bhopal state included the present-day [[Bhopal District|Bhopal]], [[Raisen District|Raisen]], and [[Sehore District|Sehore]] districts, and was part of the [[Central India Agency]]. It straddled the [[Vindhya Range]], with the northern portion lying on the [[Malwa]] [[plateau]], and the southern portion lying in the [[valley]] of the [[Narmada River]], which formed the state's southern boundary. [[Bhopal Agency]] was formed as an administrative section of Central India, consisting the Bhopal state and some princely states to the northeast, including [[Khilchipur]], [[Narsinghgarh, Damoh|Narsingarh]], [[Rajgarh, Madhya Pradesh|Rajgarh]], and after 1931 the [[Dewas]] states. It was administered by an agent to the British [[Governor-General of India]].\n\n==The rule of the Begums==\n[[File:Bhopal Government Postage - One Anna Six Pies.png|thumb|right|The Bhopal State postal service was introduced during the rule of the Begums.]]\nBetween 1819 and 1926, it was ruled by four women \u2013 Begums \u2013 unique in the royalty of those days. Qudsia Begum was the first woman ruler, who was succeeded by her only daughter Sikandar Begum, who in turn was succeeded by her only daughter, Shah Jahan Begum. Sultan Shah Jahan Begum was the last women ruler, who after 25 years of rule, abdicated in favour of her son, Hamidullah Khan. The rule of Begums gave the city its waterworks, railways, a postal system and a municipality constituted in 1907.\n\n===Qudsia Begum===\nIn 1819, 18-year-old Qudsia Begum (also known as Gohar Begum) took over the reins after the assassination of her husband. She was the first female ruler of Bhopal. Although she was illiterate, she was brave and refused to follow the [[purdah]] tradition. She declared that her 2-year-old daughter Sikander will follow her as the ruler. None of the male family members dared to challenge her decision. She cared very well for her subjects and took her dinners only after receiving the news every night that all her subjects had taken meals. She built the Jama Masjid (mosque) and her beautiful palace the 'Gohar Mahal'(also called Nazar Bagh) in Bhopal. She ruled till 1837 when she died having adequately prepared her daughter for ruling the state.\n\n===Sikander Jahan Begum===\n[[File:Sikandar Begum Bhopal.jpg|right|thumb|120px|Sikandar Begum]]\nIn 1844, Sikander Begum succeeded her mother as the ruler of Bhopal. Like her mother, she too never observed purdah. She was trained in the martial arts, and fought many battles during her reign (1844\u20131868).{{Citation needed|reason=battles against whom ?|date=July 2013}}\n\nDuring the [[Indian rebellion of 1857]], she sided with the British and crushed all those who revolted against them. She did a lot of public welfare too \u2013 she built roads and reconstructed the fort. She also built the Moti Masjid (meaning the Pearl Mosque) and Moti Mahal (the Pearl Palace).\n\n====Indian rebellion of 1857====\nDuring the [[Indian rebellion of 1857]], the Bhopal state sided with the East India Company, as per the treaty of 1818. The rebellion in Bhopal and neighbouring areas was suppressed by Sikander Begum in its initial stages.\n\nBy June 1857, the rebellion had spread to neighbouring areas of Bhopal, such as [[Indore]], [[Mhow]], and [[Neemuch]]. In the beginning of July 1857, Sikandar Begum was informed by Bakhshi Murawwat Mohammed Khan Nasrat Jang, that the rebel forces from neighbouring areas were marching towards Bhopal. She asked Khan to repulse the rebel forces from Mhow.<ref name=\"radianceweekly_1857\">{{cite web|url=http://www.radianceweekly.com/cover_story.php?content_id=178&issue_id=48|title=How Bhopal Ruler Tackled 1857 Revolt|author=Pervez Bari|date=31 December 2006|work=Radiance Viewsweekly Vol. XLIV No. 28|accessdate=2007-08-02|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928201210/http://www.radianceweekly.com/cover_story.php?content_id=178&issue_id=48|archive-date=28 September 2007|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nIn some of the mosques of Bhopal, the rebellion against the [[British East India Company|East India Company]] was declared as [[jihad]] by the [[Maulvi]]s and the [[Pashtun people|Pathan]]s. The rebels maintained contacts with [[Rani Lakshmibai]] of Jhansi, [[Tatya Tope]], the [[Nawab of Tonk]], Nawab of [[Banda, Uttar Pradesh|Banda]] and others. They also acknowledged [[Bahadur Shah Zafar]] as the [[emperor of India]], and sent offerings to [[Delhi]] in form of horses and cash.<ref name=\"radianceweekly_1857\"/>\n\nIt was reported that the rebels were mobilising people for revolt by spreading messages through ''[[chapati]]s'' in villages. Sikander Begum banned the distribution of these chapatis from village to village. She required undertakings from the ''[[balahi]]'' and ''[[patel]]'' (chiefs) of every village, to report any violations to the concerned ''thana'' (police station). Sikandar Begum also banned the circulation of any [[sedition|seditious]] notices either found lying on the road or stuck on the walls.  Maulvi Abdul Qayyum, the ''[[darogha]]'' of Fatehgarh fort distributed 500 copies of a pamphlet issued by the rebels of [[Siege of Cawnpore|Cawnpore]] (now [[Kanpur]]). The pamphlet claimed that the British were interfering with the religious sentiments of Hindus and Muslims, and urged them to rebel against the British rule in India.  Sikandar Begum instituted an inquiry against the Maulvi, who was charged of [[collusion]] with the rebels. She also published a pamphlet from Sikandari press, denying the charges of British interference in the religious affairs of Hindus and Muslims.\n\nThe Bhopal state had an army under the direct command of British officers, raised under the Anglo-Bhopal treaty of 1818, and consisting of 600 cavalry and 400 infantry. When the signs of a rebellion started appearing in the army, Major William Henry Richards (the Political Agent at Bhopal) and other British officers withdrew to a safer place at [[Hoshangabad]] near Bhopal, leaving the matter under the direct charge of the Begum. Mama Qahhar Khan, the ''[[jamadar]]'' in the Vilayatian Regiment, and the [[sepoy]]s under him refused to accept their pay, and revolted; they were punished by being discharged from the service.\n\nIn the [[Berasia]] tehsil of Bhopal, the rebel leaders Shajaat Khan [[Pindari]] and Jahangir Muhammad Khan raised a small force consisting of 70 sepoys. They launched an attack on Berasia on 14 July 1857. The rebels looted the township, and killed Babu Subh Rao (the assistant Political Agent), Munshi Mukhdum Bakhsh and other British loyalists. They also plundered the local treasury and seized the assets of the state officers they had killed. They were supported by some sepoys from the Bhopal Contingent stationed at Berasia. Sikandar Begum took measures against the rebels in Berasia and neighbouring areas, forcing them to flee. Shajaat Khan Pindari had plans to flee and join Fazil Muhammad Khan, the [[jagirdar]] of Garhi Ambapani, or Prince Bhawani Singh of [[Narsinghgarh, Damoh|Narsingarh]]. However, he was arrested with help of spies, and brought to the Sehore jail along with his followers. He and his son were hanged near [[mosque|idgah]] of the town, and then buried beneath a [[madhuca longifolia|mahua]] tree by some sweepers.<ref name=\"radianceweekly_1857\"/>\n\nOn 6 August 1857, [[Risaldar]] Wali Shah and Kotha-[[Havaldar]] Mahavir declared a [[sepoy]] rebellion at [[Sehore]] cantonment near Bhopal. They  pronounced the symbols of revolt as the ''Nishan-i-Muhammadi'' (\"the symbol of Muhammad\", for Muslims) and the ''Nishan-i-Mahaviri'' (\"the symbol of Mahavir\", for Hindus). The rebel sepoys decided to collect at least Rs. 200,000 from the Mahajans of Sehore, by foul or fair means.  The rebel leader Mahavir looted Rs. 700 from the state treasury of the Sehore [[tehsil]]. They also ransacked and burned the [[bungalow]]s of the British officers, and made attempts to plunder arms and ammunitions from the [[magazine (artillery)|magazine]].\n\nIn the Piklon tehsil of Bhopal, the rebellion was led by Muhammad Abu Saeed Khan (popularly known as Nawab of Itarsiwala), Raja Chhatarsal of [[Agra]], Aqil Muhammad Khan, Fazil Muhammad Khan and Adil Muhammad Khan of Garhi Ambapani. The rebel leaders planned to occupy the town. Sikander Begum sought help from the [[Scindia]] [[Maharaja]] of [[Gwalior]] to defeat the rebels, but the rebel army consisting of around 300 men attacked Piklon. The small state force was forced to retreat, and the [[tehsildar]] of Piklon fled to Scindia's territory. The rebels plundered the Piklon town, and neighbouring villages such as Chopra, Bisraha and Bisrai. They also established a ''thana'' (station) at Piklon. However, they were soon ousted by the state forces.\n\n{{see also|Indian rebellion of 1857}}\n\n=== Shah Jahan Begum ===\n[[File:Shahjahan begum yong.jpg|thumb|120px|A young Shah Jahan Begum]]\n{{Main|Sultan Shah Jahan, Begum of Bhopal}}\nSikander Begum's successor Shah Jahan Begum (begum 1844\u201360, Sikandar Begum being regent; ruled 1868\u20131901) was quite passionate about architecture, like her Mughal namesake emperor [[Shah Jahan]]. She built a vast mini-city, called Shahjahanabad after her. She also built a new palace for herself, the [[Taj Mahal, Bhopal|Taj Mahal]] (not to be confused with the famous [[Taj Mahal]] at Agra). She built many other beautiful buildings as well, including Ali Manzil, Amir Ganj, Barah Mahal, Ali Manzil, Be nazir Complex, Khawasoura, Mughalpura, Nematpua and Nawab Manzils. Today, one can see the ruins of Taj Mahal and some of the parts that have stood the test of time; Barah Mahal and Nawab Manzil have also stood the test of time. During her rule, in 1900, the complete failure of the [[monsoon]] rains led to a severe famine in Bhopal. Most notable among the achievements of Shah Jahan Begum was that under her rule the economy flourished. During this period Bhopal had the highest{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} GDP contribution towards the Indian economy mainly due to its superior craftsmanship and rich gold works.\n\n===Kaikhusrau Jahan Begum===\nSultan Kaikhusrau Jahan Begum, [[GCSI]], [[GCIE]], [[GBE]], [[Order of the Crown of India|CI]], [[Kaisar-i-Hind Medal|KIH]] (9 July 1858 \u2013 12 May 1930) daughter of Shah Jahan Begum, succeeded her in 1901, ruling to her abdication in favour of her son in 1926.

She developed her own walled mini-city, named Ahmedabad after her late husband (not to be confused with [[Ahmedabad]], Gujarat). This city was situated at Tekri Maulvee Zai-ud-din, which was at located a distance of a mile from the fort. She built a palace called Qaser-e-Sultani (now [[Saifia College]]). This area became a posh residency as royalty and elite moved here. The Begum installed the first water pump here and developed a garden called 'Zie-up-Abser'. She also constructed a new palace called 'Noor-us-Sabah', which has been converted into a heritage hotel. She was the first president of the All India Conference on Education and first chancellor of the [[Aligarh Muslim University]].\n\nThe peaceful rule of Begums led to the rise of a unique mixed culture in Bhopal.  The Hindus were given important administrative positions in the state.  This led to communal peace and a cosmopolitan culture took its roots.\n\n==After Indian independence==\nSultan Kaikhusrau Jahan Begum's son, [[Nawab]] [[Hamidullah Khan]], ascended the throne in 1926. He was Chancellor of the [[Chamber of Princes]]. He was the last ruling [[Nawabs of Bhopal|nawab of Bhopal]]. An active member of the independence movement, [[Hamidullah Khan]] was a delegate at the [[Round Table Conference]] from 1930\u20131932, an active member of the [[All-India Muslim League]], and a close political ally of [[Muhammad Ali Jinnah]].   However, like the rulers of [[Jammu and Kashmir (princely state)|Kashmir]], [[Hyderabad State|Hyderabad]], [[Kingdom of Sikkim|Sikkim]], and others, he desired to maintain his state's autonomy. Bhopal, along with [[Hyderabad State|Hyderabad]] and [[Kingdom of Travancore|Travancore]], became one of the Indian [[princely states]] which officially refused to join either the [[Dominion of India]] or the [[Dominion of Pakistan]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Copland |first1=Ian |title=Lord Mountbatten and the Integration of the Indian States: A Reappraisal |journal=The Journal of Imperial and Commonwealth History |volume=21 |issue=2 |pages=385\u2013408 |doi=10.1080/03086539308582896 |year=1993 }}</ref> As a Muslim ruler in Central India, Hamidullah Khan opposed the [[Partition of India]], in part because he feared it would marginalise Muslims outside [[West Pakistan|West]] or [[East Pakistan]], and instead sought regional Muslim autonomy within India.\n\n[[Hamidullah Khan]] expressed his wish to retain Bhopal as a separate independent state in March 1948. Agitations against the Nawab broke out in December 1948, leading to the arrest of prominent leaders including Bhai Ratan Kumar Gupta and [[Shankar Dayal Sharma]], the future president of India on 5 & 6 January 1949 respectively. Sharma was sentenced to eight months imprisonment for violating restrictions on public meetings; some other [[satyagraha|satyagrahis]] like Ram charan Rai, Biharilal Ghatt, Thakur Lalsingh, Laxminarayan Sinhal were also arrested. Amidst the Vilinikaran Andolan, many were shot dead by the Nawabi police, including the martyrs of Boras. Sardar Patel took the situation seriously, sent V P Menon for the Merger Agreement negotiations on 23 January 1949. Later, in February 1949, the political detainees were released and the Nawab Bhopal had to  sign the agreement for merger on 30 April 1949.<ref name=\"SRBakshi_OPRalhan_2007\">{{cite book|title=Madhya Pradesh Through the Ages|author1=S.

Came to India as a youth, took service in the Mughal army, and later founded Bhopal State during the anarchy following the death of emperor [[Aurangzeb]].\n* Sultan Muhammad Khan (1728\u20131742). Born 1720, legitimate son of Dost Mohammad. Succeeded aged eight under the regency of his much older half-brother. Attempted to seize real power in 1742 when the regent died, but was defeated by the regent's family.

Never proclaimed himself ruler.\n* Nawab [[Faiz Mohammad Khan]] (1742\u20131777). Eldest son of regent Yar Mohammad. A religious and unworldly man, he left administration to his step-mother, [[Mamola Bai]], a lady of [[Rajput]] birth who had been instrumental in securing the throne for him. No children.\n* Nawab Hayat Mohammad Khan (1777\u20131807). Second son of Yar Mohammad. When besieged by the Marathas in 1795, he sought the help of a distant but agnatic cousin, Wazir Mohammad, and later put him in charge of administration. Thus did Wazir Khan, ancestor of the future royal family, gain ascendency in the Bhopal court.\n* Nawab Ghous Mohammad Khan (1807\u20131826). Son of Hayat Mohammad and father of Begum Qudsia.

The state was merged into the [[Union of India]] in 1949 as [[Bhopal State (1949\u201356)|Bhopal]]. In 1901 the state had a population of 665,961 and an average revenue of Rs.25,00,000.<ref>https://dsal.uchicago.edu/reference/gazetteer/pager.html?objectid=DS405.1.I34_V08_131.gif</ref>\n\n==Establishment==\n[[File:Dost Mohammad Khan, Bhopal.jpg|thumb|Dost Muhammad Khan Bahadur, Founder of Bhopal State]]\nThe State of Bhopal was established by [[Dost Mohammad Khan, Nawab of Bhopal|Dost Mohammad Khan]] (1672\u20131728), a [[Pashtun people|pashtun]] soldier in the [[Mughal Army]].<ref>{{cite book | title = The Waterhouse albums: central Indian provinces|author1=John Falconer |author2=James Waterhouse | publisher = Mapin | year = 2009 | isbn = 978-81-89995-30-0 }}</ref>  After the death of the emperor [[Aurangzeb]], Khan started providing mercenary services to several local chieftains in the politically unstable Malwa region.

The Marathas  conquered several nearby states, including [[Indore]] to the west and [[Gwalior state|Gwalior]] to the north, but Bhopal remained a Muslim-ruled state under Dost Mohammed Khan's successors. Subsequently, Nawab Wazir Mohammed Khan, a general, created a truly strong state after fighting several wars.\n\nNawab Jahangir Mohammed Khan established a [[cantonment]] at a distance of one mile from the fort. This was called Jahangirabad after him. He built gardens and barracks for British guests and soldiers in Jahangirabad.\n\nIn 1778, during the [[First Anglo-Maratha War]],  when the British General Thomas Goddard campaigned across India, Bhopal was one of the few states that remained friendly to the British. In 1809, during the [[Second Anglo-Maratha War]], General Close led a British expedition to Central India. The [[Nawab of Bhopal]] petitioned in vain to be received under British protection. In 1817, when the [[Third Anglo-Maratha War]] broke out, a treaty of dependence was signed between the British Government of India and the Nawab of Bhopal. Bhopal remained a friend of British Government during the [[British Raj]] in India.\n\nIn February\u2013March 1818, Bhopal became a [[princely state]] in [[British India]] as a result of the Anglo-Bhopal treaty between the East India Company and Nawab Nazar Muhammad (Nawab of Bhopal during 1816\u20131819). Bhopal state included the present-day [[Bhopal District|Bhopal]], [[Raisen District|Raisen]], and [[Sehore District|Sehore]] districts, and was part of the [[Central India Agency]]. It straddled the [[Vindhya Range]], with the northern portion lying on the [[Malwa]] [[plateau]], and the southern portion lying in the [[valley]] of the [[Narmada River]], which formed the state's southern boundary. [[Bhopal Agency]] was formed as an administrative section of Central India, consisting the Bhopal state and some princely states to the northeast, including [[Khilchipur]], [[Narsinghgarh, Damoh|Narsingarh]], [[Rajgarh, Madhya Pradesh|Rajgarh]], and after 1931 the [[Dewas]] states. It was administered by an agent to the British [[Governor-General of India]].\n\n==The rule of the Begums==\n[[File:Bhopal Government Postage - One Anna Six Pies.png|thumb|right|The Bhopal State postal service was introduced during the rule of the Begums.]]\nBetween 1819 and 1926, it was ruled by four women \u2013 Begums \u2013 unique in the royalty of those days. Qudsia Begum was the first woman ruler, who was succeeded by her only daughter Sikandar Begum, who in turn was succeeded by her only daughter, Shah Jahan Begum. Sultan Shah Jahan Begum was the last women ruler, who after 25 years of rule, abdicated in favour of her son, Hamidullah Khan. The rule of Begums gave the city its waterworks, railways, a postal system and a municipality constituted in 1907.\n\n===Qudsia Begum===\nIn 1819, 18-year-old Qudsia Begum (also known as Gohar Begum) took over the reins after the assassination of her husband. She was the first female ruler of Bhopal. Although she was illiterate, she was brave and refused to follow the [[purdah]] tradition. She declared that her 2-year-old daughter Sikander will follow her as the ruler. None of the male family members dared to challenge her decision. She cared very well for her subjects and took her dinners only after receiving the news every night that all her subjects had taken meals. She built the Jama Masjid (mosque) and her beautiful palace the 'Gohar Mahal'(also called Nazar Bagh) in Bhopal. She ruled till 1837 when she died having adequately prepared her daughter for ruling the state.\n\n===Sikander Jahan Begum===\n[[File:Sikandar Begum Bhopal.jpg|right|thumb|120px|Sikandar Begum]]\nIn 1844, Sikander Begum succeeded her mother as the ruler of Bhopal. Like her mother, she too never observed purdah. She was trained in the martial arts, and fought many battles during her reign (1844\u20131868).{{Citation needed|reason=battles against whom ?|date=July 2013}}\n\nDuring the [[Indian rebellion of 1857]], she sided with the British and crushed all those who revolted against them. She did a lot of public welfare too \u2013 she built roads and reconstructed the fort. She also built the Moti Masjid (meaning the Pearl Mosque) and Moti Mahal (the Pearl Palace).\n\n====Indian rebellion of 1857====\nDuring the [[Indian rebellion of 1857]], the Bhopal state sided with the East India Company, as per the treaty of 1818. The rebellion in Bhopal and neighbouring areas was suppressed by Sikander Begum in its initial stages.\n\nBy June 1857, the rebellion had spread to neighbouring areas of Bhopal, such as [[Indore]], [[Mhow]], and [[Neemuch]]. In the beginning of July 1857, Sikandar Begum was informed by Bakhshi Murawwat Mohammed Khan Nasrat Jang, that the rebel forces from neighbouring areas were marching towards Bhopal. She asked Khan to repulse the rebel forces from Mhow.<ref name=\"radianceweekly_1857\">{{cite web|url=http://www.radianceweekly.com/cover_story.php?content_id=178&issue_id=48|title=How Bhopal Ruler Tackled 1857 Revolt|author=Pervez Bari|date=31 December 2006|work=Radiance Viewsweekly Vol. XLIV No. 28|accessdate=2007-08-02|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928201210/http://www.radianceweekly.com/cover_story.php?content_id=178&issue_id=48|archive-date=28 September 2007|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nIn some of the mosques of Bhopal, the rebellion against the [[British East India Company|East India Company]] was declared as [[jihad]] by the [[Maulvi]]s and the [[Pashtun people|Pathan]]s. The rebels maintained contacts with [[Rani Lakshmibai]] of Jhansi, [[Tatya Tope]], the [[Nawab of Tonk]], Nawab of [[Banda, Uttar Pradesh|Banda]] and others. They also acknowledged [[Bahadur Shah Zafar]] as the [[emperor of India]], and sent offerings to [[Delhi]] in form of horses and cash.<ref name=\"radianceweekly_1857\"/>\n\nIt was reported that the rebels were mobilising people for revolt by spreading messages through ''[[chapati]]s'' in villages. Sikander Begum banned the distribution of these chapatis from village to village. She required undertakings from the ''[[balahi]]'' and ''[[patel]]'' (chiefs) of every village, to report any violations to the concerned ''thana'' (police station). Sikandar Begum also banned the circulation of any [[sedition|seditious]] notices either found lying on the road or stuck on the walls.  Maulvi Abdul Qayyum, the ''[[darogha]]'' of Fatehgarh fort distributed 500 copies of a pamphlet issued by the rebels of [[Siege of Cawnpore|Cawnpore]] (now [[Kanpur]]). The pamphlet claimed that the British were interfering with the religious sentiments of Hindus and Muslims, and urged them to rebel against the British rule in India.  Sikandar Begum instituted an inquiry against the Maulvi, who was charged of [[collusion]] with the rebels. She also published a pamphlet from Sikandari press, denying the charges of British interference in the religious affairs of Hindus and Muslims.\n\nThe Bhopal state had an army under the direct command of British officers, raised under the Anglo-Bhopal treaty of 1818, and consisting of 600 cavalry and 400 infantry. When the signs of a rebellion started appearing in the army, Major William Henry Richards (the Political Agent at Bhopal) and other British officers withdrew to a safer place at [[Hoshangabad]] near Bhopal, leaving the matter under the direct charge of the Begum. Mama Qahhar Khan, the ''[[jamadar]]'' in the Vilayatian Regiment, and the [[sepoy]]s under him refused to accept their pay, and revolted; they were punished by being discharged from the service.\n\nIn the [[Berasia]] tehsil of Bhopal, the rebel leaders Shajaat Khan [[Pindari]] and Jahangir Muhammad Khan raised a small force consisting of 70 sepoys. They launched an attack on Berasia on 14 July 1857. The rebels looted the township, and killed Babu Subh Rao (the assistant Political Agent), Munshi Mukhdum Bakhsh and other British loyalists. They also plundered the local treasury and seized the assets of the state officers they had killed. They were supported by some sepoys from the Bhopal Contingent stationed at Berasia. Sikandar Begum took measures against the rebels in Berasia and neighbouring areas, forcing them to flee. Shajaat Khan Pindari had plans to flee and join Fazil Muhammad Khan, the [[jagirdar]] of Garhi Ambapani, or Prince Bhawani Singh of [[Narsinghgarh, Damoh|Narsingarh]]. However, he was arrested with help of spies, and brought to the Sehore jail along with his followers. He and his son were hanged near [[mosque|idgah]] of the town, and then buried beneath a [[madhuca longifolia|mahua]] tree by some sweepers.<ref name=\"radianceweekly_1857\"/>\n\nOn 6 August 1857, [[Risaldar]] Wali Shah and Kotha-[[Havaldar]] Mahavir declared a [[sepoy]] rebellion at [[Sehore]] cantonment near Bhopal. They  pronounced the symbols of revolt as the ''Nishan-i-Muhammadi'' (\"the symbol of Muhammad\", for Muslims) and the ''Nishan-i-Mahaviri'' (\"the symbol of Mahavir\", for Hindus). The rebel sepoys decided to collect at least Rs. 200,000 from the Mahajans of Sehore, by foul or fair means.  The rebel leader Mahavir looted Rs. 700 from the state treasury of the Sehore [[tehsil]]. They also ransacked and burned the [[bungalow]]s of the British officers, and made attempts to plunder arms and ammunitions from the [[magazine (artillery)|magazine]].\n\nIn the Piklon tehsil of Bhopal, the rebellion was led by Muhammad Abu Saeed Khan (popularly known as Nawab of Itarsiwala), Raja Chhatarsal of [[Agra]], Aqil Muhammad Khan, Fazil Muhammad Khan and Adil Muhammad Khan of Garhi Ambapani. The rebel leaders planned to occupy the town. Sikander Begum sought help from the [[Scindia]] [[Maharaja]] of [[Gwalior]] to defeat the rebels, but the rebel army consisting of around 300 men attacked Piklon. The small state force was forced to retreat, and the [[tehsildar]] of Piklon fled to Scindia's territory. The rebels plundered the Piklon town, and neighbouring villages such as Chopra, Bisraha and Bisrai. They also established a ''thana'' (station) at Piklon. However, they were soon ousted by the state forces.\n\n{{see also|Indian rebellion of 1857}}\n\n=== Shah Jahan Begum ===\n[[File:Shahjahan begum yong.jpg|thumb|120px|A young Shah Jahan Begum]]\n{{Main|Sultan Shah Jahan, Begum of Bhopal}}\nSikander Begum's successor Shah Jahan Begum (begum 1844\u201360, Sikandar Begum being regent; ruled 1868\u20131901) was quite passionate about architecture, like her Mughal namesake emperor [[Shah Jahan]]. She built a vast mini-city, called Shahjahanabad after her. She also built a new palace for herself, the [[Taj Mahal, Bhopal|Taj Mahal]] (not to be confused with the famous [[Taj Mahal]] at Agra). She built many other beautiful buildings as well, including Ali Manzil, Amir Ganj, Barah Mahal, Ali Manzil, Be nazir Complex, Khawasoura, Mughalpura, Nematpua and Nawab Manzils. Today, one can see the ruins of Taj Mahal and some of the parts that have stood the test of time; Barah Mahal and Nawab Manzil have also stood the test of time. During her rule, in 1900, the complete failure of the [[monsoon]] rains led to a severe famine in Bhopal. Most notable among the achievements of Shah Jahan Begum was that under her rule the economy flourished. During this period Bhopal had the highest{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} GDP contribution towards the Indian economy mainly due to its superior craftsmanship and rich gold works.\n\n===Kaikhusrau Jahan Begum===\nSultan Kaikhusrau Jahan Begum, [[GCSI]], [[GCIE]], [[GBE]], [[Order of the Crown of India|CI]], [[Kaisar-i-Hind Medal|KIH]] (9 July 1858 \u2013 12 May 1930) daughter of Shah Jahan Begum, succeeded her in 1901, ruling to her abdication in favour of her son in 1926.

She developed her own walled mini-city, named Ahmedabad after her late husband (not to be confused with [[Ahmedabad]], Gujarat). This city was situated at Tekri Maulvee Zai-ud-din, which was at located a distance of a mile from the fort. She built a palace called Qaser-e-Sultani (now [[Saifia College]]). This area became a posh residency as royalty and elite moved here. The Begum installed the first water pump here and developed a garden called 'Zie-up-Abser'. She also constructed a new palace called 'Noor-us-Sabah', which has been converted into a heritage hotel. She was the first president of the All India Conference on Education and first chancellor of the [[Aligarh Muslim University]].\n\nThe peaceful rule of Begums led to the rise of a unique mixed culture in Bhopal.  The Hindus were given important administrative positions in the state.  This led to communal peace and a cosmopolitan culture took its roots.\n\n==After Indian independence==\nSultan Kaikhusrau Jahan Begum's son, [[Nawab]] [[Hamidullah Khan]], ascended the throne in 1926. He was Chancellor of the [[Chamber of Princes]]. He was the last ruling [[Nawabs of Bhopal|nawab of Bhopal]]. An active member of the independence movement, [[Hamidullah Khan]] was a delegate at the [[Round Table Conference]] from 1930-1932, an active member of the [[All-India Muslim League]], and a close political ally of [[Muhammad Ali Jinnah]].   However, like the rulers of [[Jammu and Kashmir (princely state)|Kashmir]], [[Hyderabad State|Hyderabad]], [[Kingdom of Sikkim|Sikkim]], and others, he desired to maintain his state's autonomy. Bhopal, along with [[Hyderabad State|Hyderabad]] and [[Kingdom of Travancore|Travancore]], became one of the Indian [[princely states]] which officially refused to join either the [[Dominion of India]] or the [[Dominion of Pakistan]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Copland |first1=Ian |title=Lord Mountbatten and the Integration of the Indian States: A Reappraisal |journal=The Journal of Imperial and Commonwealth History |volume=21 |issue=2 |pages=385\u2013408 |doi=10.1080/03086539308582896 |year=1993 }}</ref> As a Muslim ruler in Central India, Hamidullah Khan opposed the [[Partition of India]], in part because he feared it would marginalise Muslims outside [[West Pakistan|West]] or [[East Pakistan]], and instead sought regional Muslim autonomy within India.\n\n[[Hamidullah Khan]] expressed his wish to retain Bhopal as a separate independent state in March 1948. Agitations against the Nawab broke out in December 1948, leading to the arrest of prominent leaders including Bhai Ratan Kumar Gupta and [[Shankar Dayal Sharma]], the future president of India on 5 & 6 January 1949 respectively. Sharma was sentenced to eight months imprisonment for violating restrictions on public meetings; some other [[satyagraha|satyagrahis]] like Ram charan Rai, Biharilal Ghatt, Thakur Lalsingh, Laxminarayan Sinhal were also arrested. Amidst the Vilinikaran Andolan, many were shot dead by the Nawabi police, including the martyrs of Boras. Sardar Patel took the situation seriously, sent V P Menon for the Merger Agreement negotiations on 23 January 1949.
