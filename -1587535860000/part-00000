He made his [[Bollywood]] debut in 1992 with ''[[Deewana (1992 film)|Deewana]]''. Early in his career, Khan was recognised for portraying villainous roles in the films ''[[Baazigar]]'' (1993), ''[[Darr]]'' (1993), and ''[[Anjaam]]'' (1994).

A vaccine typically contains an agent that resembles a disease-causing microorganism and is often made from weakened or killed forms of the microbe, its toxins, or one of its surface proteins. The agent stimulates the body's [[immune system]] to recognize the agent as a threat, destroy it, and to further recognize and destroy any of the microorganisms associated with that agent that it may encounter in the future.

The proposed mechanism is the insertion (and [[Gene expression|expression]], enhanced by the use of [[electroporation]], triggering immune system recognition) of viral or bacterial DNA into human or animal cells. Some cells of the immune system that recognize the proteins expressed will mount an attack against these proteins and cells expressing them. Because these cells live for a very long time, if the [[pathogen]] that normally expresses these proteins is encountered at a later time, they will be attacked instantly by the immune system.

For example, the vaccine names used in the United States have well-established abbreviations that are also widely known and used elsewhere. An extensive list of them provided in a sortable table and freely accessible, is available at a US [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] web page.<ref name=\"CDC_US_vaccine_names\">{{Citation |author=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention |title=U.S. Vaccine Names |url=https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/about/terms/USVaccines.html |access-date=2016-05-21 |postscript=. |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160526212322/http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/about/terms/USVaccines.html |archive-date=2016-05-26 }}</ref> The page explains that \"The abbreviations [in] this table (Column 3) were standardized jointly by staff of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, [[Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices|ACIP]] Work Groups, the editor of the ''[[Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report]]'' (MMWR), the editor of ''Epidemiology and Prevention of Vaccine-Preventable Diseases'' (the Pink Book), ACIP members, and liaison organizations to the ACIP.\"<ref name=\"CDC_US_vaccine_names\"/> Some examples are \"DTaP\" for diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and acellular pertussis vaccine, \"DT\" for diphtheria and tetanus toxoids, and \"Td\" for tetanus and diphtheria toxoids.

Lower-case \"d\" and \"p\" denote reduced doses of diphtheria and pertussis used in the adolescent/adult-formulations. The 'a' in DTaP and Tdap stands for 'acellular,' meaning that the pertussis component contains only a part of the pertussis organism.\"<ref name=\"CDC_tetanus_vaccination\"/> Another list of established vaccine abbreviations is at the CDC's page called \"Vaccine Acronyms and Abbreviations\", with abbreviations used on U.S. immunization records.<ref name=\"CDC_US_vaccine_abbreviations\">{{Citation |author=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention |title=Vaccine Acronyms and Abbreviations [Abbreviations used on U.S. immunization records] |url=https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/terms/vacc-abbrev.html |access-date=2017-05-22 |postscript=. |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170602192710/https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/terms/vacc-abbrev.html |archive-date=2017-06-02 |date=2018-02-02 }}</ref> The [[United States Adopted Name]] system has some conventions for the [[word order]] of vaccine names, placing [[head (linguistics)|head nouns]] first and [[postpositive adjective|adjectives postpositively]]. This is why the USAN for \"[[polio vaccine|OPV]]\" is \"poliovirus vaccine live oral\" rather than \"oral poliovirus vaccine\".\n\n==Developing immunity==\nThe [[immune system]] recognizes vaccine agents as foreign, destroys them, and \"remembers\" them. When the [[virulence|virulent]] version of an agent is encountered, the body recognizes the protein coat on the virus, and thus is prepared to respond, by (1) neutralizing the target agent before it can enter cells, and (2) recognizing and destroying infected cells before that agent can multiply to vast numbers.\n\nWhen two or more vaccines are mixed together in the same formulation, the two vaccines can interfere. This most frequently occurs with live attenuated vaccines, where one of the vaccine components is more robust than the others and suppresses the growth and immune response to the other components. This phenomenon was first noted in the trivalent Sabin [[polio vaccine]], where the amount of serotype 2 virus in the vaccine had to be reduced to stop it from interfering with the \"take\" of the serotype 1 and 3 viruses in the vaccine.<ref>{{cite book|vauthors=Sutter RW, Cochi SL, Melnick JL |year=1999|chapter=Live attenuated polio vaccines|veditors=Plotkin SA, Orenstein WA |title=Vaccines|location=Philadelphia|publisher=W.

Tetanus toxoid, for instance, is usually adsorbed onto [[alum]]. This presents the antigen in such a way as to produce a greater action than the simple aqueous tetanus toxoid. People who have an adverse reaction to adsorbed tetanus toxoid may be given the simple vaccine when the time comes for a booster.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Engler|first=Renata J.

Vaccines are complex mixtures of biological compounds, and unlike the case of drugs, there are no true generic vaccines. The vaccine produced by a new facility must undergo complete clinical testing for safety and efficacy similar to that undergone by that produced by the original manufacturer. For most vaccines, specific processes have been patented. These can be circumvented by alternative manufacturing methods, but this required R&D infrastructure and a suitably skilled workforce. In the case of a few relatively new vaccines such as the human papillomavirus vaccine, the patents may impose an additional barrier.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/phi/publications/Increasing_Access_to_Vaccines_Through_Technology_Transfer.pdf|title=www.who.int|format=|website=|access-date=|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151123091841/http://www.who.int/phi/publications/Increasing_Access_to_Vaccines_Through_Technology_Transfer.pdf|archive-date=2015-11-23}}</ref>\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Preparation of measles vaccines.jpg|thumb|Two workers make openings in chicken eggs in preparation for production of measles vaccine.]]\nVaccine production has several stages.

The agent stimulates the body's [[immune system]] to recognize the agent as a threat, destroy it, and to further recognize and destroy any of the microorganisms associated with that agent that it may encounter in the future.

The proposed mechanism is the insertion (and [[Gene expression|expression]], enhanced by the use of [[electroporation]], triggering immune system recognition) of viral or bacterial DNA into human or animal cells. Some cells of the immune system that recognize the proteins expressed will mount an attack against these proteins and cells expressing them. Because these cells live for a very long time, if the [[pathogen]] that normally expresses these proteins is encountered at a later time, they will be attacked instantly by the immune system.

For example, the vaccine names used in the United States have well-established abbreviations that are also widely known and used elsewhere. An extensive list of them provided in a sortable table and freely accessible, is available at a US [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] web page.<ref name=\"CDC_US_vaccine_names\">{{Citation |author=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention |title=U.S. Vaccine Names |url=https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/about/terms/USVaccines.html |access-date=2016-05-21 |postscript=. |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160526212322/http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/about/terms/USVaccines.html |archive-date=2016-05-26 }}</ref> The page explains that \"The abbreviations [in] this table (Column 3) were standardized jointly by staff of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, [[Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices|ACIP]] Work Groups, the editor of the ''[[Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report]]'' (MMWR), the editor of ''Epidemiology and Prevention of Vaccine-Preventable Diseases'' (the Pink Book), ACIP members, and liaison organizations to the ACIP.\"<ref name=\"CDC_US_vaccine_names\"/> Some examples are \"DTaP\" for diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and acellular pertussis vaccine, \"DT\" for diphtheria and tetanus toxoids, and \"Td\" for tetanus and diphtheria toxoids.

Lower-case \"d\" and \"p\" denote reduced doses of diphtheria and pertussis used in the adolescent/adult-formulations. The 'a' in DTaP and Tdap stands for 'acellular,' meaning that the pertussis component contains only a part of the pertussis organism.\"<ref name=\"CDC_tetanus_vaccination\"/> Another list of established vaccine abbreviations is at the CDC's page called \"Vaccine Acronyms and Abbreviations\", with abbreviations used on U.S. immunization records.<ref name=\"CDC_US_vaccine_abbreviations\">{{Citation |author=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention |title=Vaccine Acronyms and Abbreviations [Abbreviations used on U.S. immunization records] |url=https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/terms/vacc-abbrev.html |access-date=2017-05-22 |postscript=. |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170602192710/https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/terms/vacc-abbrev.html |archive-date=2017-06-02 |date=2018-02-02 }}</ref> The [[United States Adopted Name]] system has some conventions for the [[word order]] of vaccine names, placing [[head (linguistics)|head nouns]] first and [[postpositive adjective|adjectives postpositively]]. This is why the USAN for \"[[polio vaccine|OPV]]\" is \"poliovirus vaccine live oral\" rather than \"oral poliovirus vaccine\".\n\n==Developing immunity==\nThe [[immune system]] recognizes vaccine agents as foreign, destroys them, and \"remembers\" them. When the [[virulence|virulent]] version of an agent is encountered, the body recognizes the protein coat on the virus, and thus is prepared to respond, by (1) neutralizing the target agent before it can enter cells, and (2) recognizing and destroying infected cells before that agent can multiply to vast numbers.\n\nWhen two or more vaccines are mixed together in the same formulation, the two vaccines can interfere. This most frequently occurs with live attenuated vaccines, where one of the vaccine components is more robust than the others and suppresses the growth and immune response to the other components. This phenomenon was first noted in the trivalent Sabin [[polio vaccine]], where the amount of serotype 2 virus in the vaccine had to be reduced to stop it from interfering with the \"take\" of the serotype 1 and 3 viruses in the vaccine.<ref>{{cite book|vauthors=Sutter RW, Cochi SL, Melnick JL |year=1999|chapter=Live attenuated polio vaccines|veditors=Plotkin SA, Orenstein WA |title=Vaccines|location=Philadelphia|publisher=W.

Tetanus toxoid, for instance, is usually adsorbed onto [[alum]]. This presents the antigen in such a way as to produce a greater action than the simple aqueous tetanus toxoid. People who have an adverse reaction to adsorbed tetanus toxoid may be given the simple vaccine when the time comes for a booster.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Engler|first=Renata J.

Vaccines are complex mixtures of biological compounds, and unlike the case of drugs, there are no true generic vaccines. The vaccine produced by a new facility must undergo complete clinical testing for safety and efficacy similar to that undergone by that produced by the original manufacturer. For most vaccines, specific processes have been patented. These can be circumvented by alternative manufacturing methods, but this required R&D infrastructure and a suitably skilled workforce. In the case of a few relatively new vaccines such as the human papillomavirus vaccine, the patents may impose an additional barrier.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/phi/publications/Increasing_Access_to_Vaccines_Through_Technology_Transfer.pdf|title=www.who.int|format=|website=|access-date=|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151123091841/http://www.who.int/phi/publications/Increasing_Access_to_Vaccines_Through_Technology_Transfer.pdf|archive-date=2015-11-23}}</ref>\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Preparation of measles vaccines.jpg|thumb|Two workers make openings in chicken eggs in preparation for production of measles vaccine.]]\nVaccine production has several stages.

Infection in [[fish]] hosts can be extremely long-lasting, potentially persisting for the lifetime of the host.

The economic impact of such [[parasite]]s can be severe, especially where [[prevalence]] rates are high; they may also have a severe impact on wild fish stocks.\n\nThe economically most significant diseases worldwide caused by myxosporeas in cultured fishes are PKD-[[Proliferative Kidney Disease]], caused by a [[Malacosporea]] member, ''[[Tetracapsuloides bryosalmonae]]'', and [[whirling disease]], caused by a [[Myxosporea]] member ''[[Myxobolus cerebralis]]''; both diseases affect [[salmonid]]s.

Infection in [[fish]] hosts can be extremely long-lasting, potentially persisting for the lifetime of the host. However, an increasing number of myxosporeans have become commercially important pathogens of fish, largely as a result of [[aquaculture]] bringing new species into contact with myxosporeans to which they had not been previously exposed and to which they are highly susceptible. The economic impact of such [[parasite]]s can be severe, especially where [[prevalence]] rates are high; they may also have a severe impact on wild fish stocks.\n\nThe economically most significant diseases worldwide caused by myxosporeas in cultured fishes are PKD-[[Proliferative Kidney Disease]], caused by a [[Malacosporea]] member, ''[[Tetracapsuloides bryosalmonae]]'', and [[whirling disease]], caused by a [[Myxosporea]] member ''[[Myxobolus cerebralis]]''; both diseases affect [[salmonid]]s.

''The Diary of Fanny Burney'', Dent (Everyman edition), London, 1971, p. 32.</ref> The touch of understandable spite hereby revealed in Thrale's nature is tempered by her wry humour in remarking (after another of her male guests had professed devotion to Sophy and the desire to \"soothe\" her): \"I would ensure her power of crying herself into any of your hearts she pleased. I made her cry to Miss Burney, to show how beautiful she looked in tears\" and (on being rebuked about this) \"Oh but she liked it... Miss Burney would have run away but she came forward on purpose to show herself. Sophy Streatfeild is never happier than when tears trickle down from her fine eyes in company.\"<ref>Burney, F.

The levelling marriage also earned her the disapproval of Burney (who would herself marry in 1793 the impoverished, Catholic \u00e9migr\u00e9 Alexandre D'Arblay) and her cousins the [[Viscount Combermere|Cottons]]. With her second husband, Hester retired to [[Brynbella]], a specially built [[country house]] on her Bach y Graig estate in the [[Vale of Clwyd]], near [[Tremeirchion]] village in north Wales.

Johnson often stayed with the Thrale household and had his own room above the library at Streatham, in which he worked. Hester's papers provide more insight into his composition process.{{citation needed|date = February 2016}}\n\nHer ''Retrospection: or a review of the most striking and important events, characters, situations, and their consequences which the last eighteen hundred years have presented to the view of mankind''<ref>Hester Thrale Piozzi, 2 vols, London: John Stockdale, 1801</ref> was an attempt at a popular history of that period, but it was not received well by critics, some of whom patently resented female intrusion into the male preserve of history. Posterity has been kinder. According to the ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', \"it has since been seen as a [[feminist history]], concerned to show changes in manners and mores in so far as they affected women; it has also been judged to anticipate Marxian history in its keen apprehension of reification: 'machines imitated mortals to unhoped perfection, and men found out they were themselves machines.'\"<ref name=\"ODNB page\" />\n\nA lexicographer in her own right Mrs. Piozzi's ''British synonymy, or, An attempt at regulating the choice of words in familiar conversation'' was published in 1794, ten years after Dr. Johnson's death, by G.G. & J.

Her impression was that Thrale was very vexatious in wishing to engross all his attention, which annoyed him much.\"{{sfn |Stapleton Cotton |Stapleton Cotton |Knollys |1866 |page=22}}\n\nJohnson wrote two verses for Thrale in 1775, the first in celebration of her 35th birthday,<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20140316214121/http://www.thrale.com/mrs_thrale_35_verses].</ref> and another in Latin to honour her.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20140316214609/http://www.thrale.com/latin_ode_hester_thrale].</ref>\n\nFanny Burney, in her diary, describes the conversations at several of Thrale's [[Party#Soir.C3.A9es|soir\u00e9es]], including one in 1779 about a young woman named Miss Sophy Streatfeild (1755\u20131835),<ref>[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/45505]</ref> who was a favourite of both Mr. Johnson and Mr. Thrale, rather to the chagrin of Hester, who commented that Sophy \"had a power of captivation that was irresistible... her beauty joined to her softness, her caressing manners, her tearful eyes, and alluring looks, would insinuate her into the heart of any man she thought worth attacking.\"<ref>Burney, F. ''The Diary of Fanny Burney'', Dent (Everyman edition), London, 1971, p. 32.</ref> The touch of understandable spite hereby revealed in Thrale's nature is tempered by her wry humour in remarking (after another of her male guests had professed devotion to Sophy and the desire to \"soothe\" her): \"I would ensure her power of crying herself into any of your hearts she pleased. I made her cry to Miss Burney, to show how beautiful she looked in tears\" and (on being rebuked about this) \"Oh but she liked it... Miss Burney would have run away but she came forward on purpose to show herself. Sophy Streatfeild is never happier than when tears trickle down from her fine eyes in company.\"<ref>Burney, F.

''The Diary of Fanny Burney'', Dent (Everyman edition), London, 1971, pp. 54\u201356.</ref> although the greater worry was whether Mr. Thrale's brewery in Southwark would escape being ransacked, which it narrowly did.<ref>Burney, F. ''The Diary of Fanny Burney'', Dent (Everyman edition), London, 1971, p. 59.</ref>\n\nFanny records Thrale's distress on losing her husband (4 April 1781), referring to her as \"sweet Mrs. Thrale\" and sympathising with the \"agitation\" she was under in having to sell the brewery and wind up his affairs.

''The Diary of Fanny Burney'', Dent (Everyman edition), London, 1971, pp. 60\u201362.</ref>\n\nDuring the ensuing years, Thrale fell in love with Gabriel Mario Piozzi, an Italian music teacher, and married him on 25 July 1784. She complained: \"I see the English newspapers are full of gross Insolence towards me,\" with one commenting how Thrale could not have imagined \"his wife's disgrace, by eventually raising an obscure and penniless Fiddler into sudden Wealth.\"{{sfn |Gopnik |2008}} This caused a rift with Johnson, which was only perfunctorily mended shortly before his death. The levelling marriage also earned her the disapproval of Fanny (who would herself marry in 1793 the impoverished, Catholic \u00e9migr\u00e9 Alexandre D'Arblay) and her cousins the [[Viscount Combermere|Cottons]]. With her second husband, Hester retired to [[Brynbella]], a specially built [[country house]] on her Bach y Graig estate in the [[Vale of Clwyd]], near [[Tremeirchion]] village in north Wales. During this time she began to reflect heavily on her ancestry, and for a time became obsessed with the idea of reclaiming her father's Canadian lands in [[Herring Cove]], an enclave of [[Nova Scotia]].{{citation needed|date = February 2016}}\n\nAfter Johnson's death, she published ''[[Anecdotes of the Late Samuel Johnson]]'' (1786) and their letters to each other (1788).<ref name=\"ODNB page\" >Michael J.

Posterity has been kinder. According to the ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', \"it has since been seen as a [[feminist history]], concerned to show changes in manners and mores in so far as they affected women; it has also been judged to anticipate Marxian history in its keen apprehension of reification: 'machines imitated mortals to unhoped perfection, and men found out they were themselves machines.'\"<ref name=\"ODNB page\" />\n\nA lexicographer in her own right Mrs. Piozzi's ''British synonymy, or, An attempt at regulating the choice of words in familiar conversation'' was published in 1794, ten years after Dr. Johnson's death, by G.G. & J.

During May, EMI released the title track, \"[[Psychomodo]]\", as the album's lead single, however it was quickly withdrawn in the UK as \"Judy Teen\" continued to climb the charts. ''The Psychomodo'' was released in June, and once \"Judy Teen\" dropped out of the UK Top 50, \"Mr. Soft\" was released in late July. The song proved to be another success, peaking at No. 8 and remaining in the charts for nine weeks.<ref>http://www.officialcharts.com/artist/3034/cockney-rebel/</ref> It also reached No. 16 in Ireland.<ref name=\"irishcharts1\">{{cite web|author=Jaclyn Ward|url=http://www.irishcharts.ie/search/placement |title=The Irish Charts - All there is to know |publisher=Irishcharts.ie |date= |accessdate=2014-05-17}}</ref>\n\nFrom May to July 1974, Cockney Rebel embarked on a major British tour.<ref name=\"NME Rock 'N' Roll Years\">{{cite book | first= John | last= Tobler | year= 1992 | title= NME Rock 'N' Roll Years | edition= 1st | publisher= Reed International Books Ltd | location= London | page= 264 | id= CN 5585}}</ref> As it progressed, the band faced growing tensions, which ultimately led to the band's split in late July.

In 2012, Harley recalled: \"The Mike Sammes Singers, practically resident on the [[BBC Light Programme]], came in to sing backing vocals, all those \"boom-boom-boom, boom\"s and bassy \"mmmmms\"s on \"Mr Soft\".\"<ref>Booklet of 2012 compilation album Cavaliers: An Anthology 1973\u20131974</ref>\n\nThe English alternative rock band [[Elbow (band)|Elbow]] called themselves \"Mr Soft\" during the early 1990s. Speaking the ''[[Birmingham Post]]'' in 2013, Harley mentioned the band and their name: {{quote|\"I kind of secretly hear and imagine the possibility that I might be an influence, and my wife will see it, but, I don't want to go there and find out that they've never heard of me!

One advert promoted Trebor Softmints, and the other Trebor Softfruits. Both adverts used two lines of the song, with changed lyrics sung by a Steve Harley sound-alike.\n\nInitially, Harley was approached with the idea of re-writing and re-recording the lines himself. However, uncomfortable at the idea of doing this, he gave permission for the advert creators to adapt the song themselves. The lyrics were re-written by Malcolm Green and an unknown vocalist was used to replicate Harley's vocal style. Ironically, much of the public believed Harley to be singing anyway.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WaTRCHbG_IA |title=Trebor - Mr Soft |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=2014-05-17}}</ref><ref>http://www.pulse2.co.uk/on-air/blogs/ray-rose-840198/entry/312/</ref> Both videos were directed by [[Len Fulford]] and produced by [[BFCS]].<ref>http://www.luerzersarchive.com/en/classic-spot-of-the-week/2016-8.html</ref><ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3-sMraeHvI</ref>\n\nFor the Softmints advert, the lyrics were rewritten accordingly:<br/>\n\n{{quote|\"Mr. Soft, won't tell you why the world in which you're living is so strange?\nOh, Mr. Soft, how come everything around you is so soft and rearranged?\"}}\n\nFor the Softfruits advert, the lyrics were:<br/>\n\n{{quote|\"Mr. Soft, ain't it grand you can afford to go abroad just to unwind?\nIt's so hot, just you be careful that the sun don't turn you softer in the mind\"}}\n\nThe use of the song in the adverts led EMI to re-release the song in the UK on 7\" vinyl during March 1988, however it was not a commercial success. Later in their 1994 hit \"[[Shakermaker]]\", the English rock band [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]] referenced the \"Mr. Soft\" character of the song and advert with the line \"I've been driving in my car with my friend Mr. Soft\".<ref>{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=wznUAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA86&lpg=PA86&dq=Shakermaker+mr+soft#v=onepage&q=Shakermaker%20mr%20soft&f=false |title = Pop Cult: Religion and Popular Music|isbn = 9780826445926|last1 = Till|first1 = Rupert|date = 2 December 2010}}</ref> In a 2004 survey by [[Phones 4u]] for the UK's most recognisable jingles, \"Mr. Soft\" ranked at No. 7 of 10.<ref>http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/3390693.stm</ref>\n\n==Viagra Advert==\nIn 2018, Harley's 1975 hit \"[[Make Me Smile (Come Up And See Me)]]\" was used in an advert for [[Viagra]], the first advert of its kind to air on UK Television. In the live concerts that are played after the advert's first airing, Harley always jokes that, while he understands, given the lyrics, why \"Make Me Smile\" was chosen, he doesn't know why they picked that song, \"when they could have just used \"Mr Soft\"!\". He normally goes right into playing \"Mr Soft\" live after the laughter from the joke has subsided, but he also often states, after the song has been played \"That was \"Mr Soft\", not the one from the Viagra advert, that's another one of my songs, but they should have done \"Mr Soft\". I took the fives a shilling on it....kerching...have you seen that ad? Do you know the one I'm talking about?\"\n\n==Release==\n\"Mr Soft\" was released by EMI Records on 7\" vinyl in the UK, Ireland, Belgium, Germany, Spain, Portugal, the Netherlands, Yugoslavia and Japan.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/Cockney-Rebel-Mr-Soft/master/237242 |title=Cockney Rebel - Mr. Soft at Discogs |publisher=Discogs.com |date= |accessdate=2014-05-17}}</ref> A UK promotional demo/DJ copy was also issued by EMI.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.45cat.com/record/emi2191 |title=Cockney Rebel - Mr. Soft / Such A Dream - EMI - UK - EMI 2191 |publisher=45cat |date= |accessdate=2014-05-17}}</ref> The majority of editions featured the B-side \"Such a Dream\", which was written by Harley, and produced by Harley and Parsons.

During May, EMI released the title track, \"[[Psychomodo]]\", as the album's lead single, however it was quickly withdrawn in the UK as \"Judy Teen\" continued to climb the charts. ''The Psychomodo'' was released in June, and once \"Judy Teen\" dropped out of the UK Top 50, \"Mr. Soft\" was released in late July. The song proved to be another success, peaking at No. 8 and remaining in the charts for nine weeks.<ref>http://www.officialcharts.com/artist/3034/cockney-rebel/</ref> It also reached No. 16 in Ireland.<ref name=\"irishcharts1\">{{cite web|author=Jaclyn Ward|url=http://www.irishcharts.ie/search/placement |title=The Irish Charts - All there is to know |publisher=Irishcharts.ie |date= |accessdate=2014-05-17}}</ref>\n\nFrom May to July 1974, Cockney Rebel embarked on a major British tour.<ref name=\"NME Rock 'N' Roll Years\">{{cite book | first= John | last= Tobler | year= 1992 | title= NME Rock 'N' Roll Years | edition= 1st | publisher= Reed International Books Ltd | location= London | page= 264 | id= CN 5585}}</ref> As it progressed, the band faced growing tensions, which ultimately led to the band's split in late July.

In 2012, Harley recalled: \"The Mike Sammes Singers, practically resident on the [[BBC Light Programme]], came in to sing backing vocals, all those \"boom-boom-boom, boom\"s and bassy \"mmmmms\"s on \"Mr Soft\".\"<ref>Booklet of 2012 compilation album Cavaliers: An Anthology 1973\u20131974</ref>\n\nThe English alternative rock band [[Elbow (band)|Elbow]] called themselves \"Mr Soft\" during the early 1990s.

One advert promoted Trebor Softmints, and the other Trebor Softfruits. Both adverts used two lines of the song, with changed lyrics sung by a Steve Harley sound-alike.\n\nInitially, Harley was approached with the idea of re-writing and re-recording the lines himself. However, uncomfortable at the idea of doing this, he gave permission for the advert creators to adapt the song themselves. The lyrics were re-written by Malcolm Green and an unknown vocalist was used to replicate Harley's vocal style. Ironically, much of the public believed Harley to be singing anyway.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WaTRCHbG_IA |title=Trebor - Mr Soft |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=2014-05-17}}</ref><ref>http://www.pulse2.co.uk/on-air/blogs/ray-rose-840198/entry/312/</ref> Both videos were directed by [[Len Fulford]] and produced by [[BFCS]].<ref>http://www.luerzersarchive.com/en/classic-spot-of-the-week/2016-8.html</ref><ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3-sMraeHvI</ref>\n\nFor the Softmints advert, the lyrics were rewritten accordingly:<br/>\n\n{{quote|\"Mr. Soft, won't tell you why the world in which you're living is so strange?\nOh, Mr. Soft, how come everything around you is so soft and rearranged?\"}}\n\nFor the Softfruits advert, the lyrics were:<br/>\n\n{{quote|\"Mr. Soft, ain't it grand you can afford to go abroad just to unwind?\nIt's so hot, just you be careful that the sun don't turn you softer in the mind\"}}\n\nThe use of the song in the adverts led EMI to re-release the song in the UK on 7\" vinyl during March 1988, however it was not a commercial success.

The university gradually expanded its offerings in the field, and by 1950, public administration courses were offered in the School of Government, Department of Business, and the Department of Political Science.  In 1953, the Department of Political Science organized these offerings into a Master of Arts in Public Administration degree.  To address the call for professional training in public administration, in 1956, graduate level public administration courses were consolidated into the newly formed Department of Business and Public Administration in the School of Government.  The school was subsequently reorganized in 1963 into the School of Government and Business Administration, including a Department of Public Administration.  That same year, the department began offering a Master of Public Administration degree. The program consisted of 36 credit hours of coursework following the early guidelines of the National Association of Public Administration and Public Affairs.  Further changes to the program expanded the course of study to a 40 credit hour program.  The Columbian College of Arts and Sciences also established Masters of Public Policy and PhD in Public Policy programs.  In 2003, all three programs were merged into the School of Public Policy and Public Administration within the [[Columbian College of Arts and Sciences]].  The School was recognized as one of the seven academic units designated as signature programs of selective excellence within the University.  Most recently, in 2007, the university Board of Trustees renamed the School of Public Policy and Public Administration the Trachtenberg School of Public Policy and Public Administration in recognition of President-emeritus [[Stephen Joel Trachtenberg]].<ref>[http://media.www.gwhatchet.com/media/storage/paper332/news/2007/05/21/News/School.Of.Public.Policy.And.Administration.Named.After.Trachtenberg-2905927.shtml School of Public Policy and Administration named after Trachtenberg] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071010115538/http://media.www.gwhatchet.com/media/storage/paper332/news/2007/05/21/News/School.Of.Public.Policy.And.Administration.Named.After.Trachtenberg-2905927.shtml |date=2007-10-10 }}</ref>\n\n==Academics==\n\nThe Trachtenberg School of Public Policy and Public Administration offers master's degrees in public policy, public administration, and environmental and natural resource policy, as well as a PhD in Public Policy and Administration and certificates in Nonprofit Management, Environmental Resource Policy, and Budget & Public Finance.\n\nThe Master of Public Administration (MPA) and Master of Public Policy (MPP) degrees each consist of a core curriculum and a field of study chosen by students.<ref>[http://www.tspppa.gwu.edu/academics/MPA/index.cfm Master of Public Administration]</ref><ref>[http://www.tspppa.gwu.edu/academics/MPP/index.cfm Master of Public Policy]</ref>  Many of these fields of study are offered in partnership with other schools within the university, including the [[Elliott School of International Affairs]], [[George Washington University School of Public Health and Health Services|School of Public Health and Health Services]], and [[The George Washington University Graduate School of Education and Human Development|Graduate School of Education & Human Development]].

The university gradually expanded its offerings in the field, and by 1950, public administration courses were offered in the School of Government, Department of Business, and the Department of Political Science.  In 1953, the Department of Political Science organized these offerings into a Master of Arts in Public Administration degree.  To address the call for professional training in public administration, in 1956, graduate level public administration courses were consolidated into the newly formed Department of Business and Public Administration in the School of Government.  The school was subsequently reorganized in 1963 into the School of Government and Business Administration, including a Department of Public Administration.  That same year, the department began offering a Master of Public Administration degree. The program consisted of 36 credit hours of coursework following the early guidelines of the National Association of Public Administration and Public Affairs.  Further changes to the program expanded the course of study to a 40 credit hour program.  The Columbian College of Arts and Sciences also established Masters of Public Policy and PhD in Public Policy programs.  In 2003, all three programs were merged into the School of Public Policy and Public Administration within the [[Columbian College of Arts and Sciences]].  The School was recognized as one of the seven academic units designated as signature programs of selective excellence within the University.  Most recently, in 2007, the university Board of Trustees renamed the School of Public Policy and Public Administration the Trachtenberg School of Public Policy and Public Administration in recognition of President-emeritus [[Stephen Joel Trachtenberg]].<ref>[http://media.www.gwhatchet.com/media/storage/paper332/news/2007/05/21/News/School.Of.Public.Policy.And.Administration.Named.After.Trachtenberg-2905927.shtml School of Public Policy and Administration named after Trachtenberg] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071010115538/http://media.www.gwhatchet.com/media/storage/paper332/news/2007/05/21/News/School.Of.Public.Policy.And.Administration.Named.After.Trachtenberg-2905927.shtml |date=2007-10-10 }}</ref>\n\n==Academics==\n\nThe Trachtenberg School of Public Policy and Public Administration offers master's degrees in public policy, public administration, and environmental and natural resource policy, as well as a PhD in Public Policy and Administration and certificates in Nonprofit Management, Environmental Resource Policy, and Budget & Public Finance.\n\nThe Master of Public Administration (MPA) and Master of Public Policy (MPP) degrees each consist of a core curriculum and a field of study chosen by students.<ref>[http://www.tspppa.gwu.edu/academics/MPA/index.cfm Master of Public Administration]</ref><ref>[http://www.tspppa.gwu.edu/academics/MPP/index.cfm Master of Public Policy]</ref>  Many of these fields of study are offered in partnership with other schools within the university, including the [[Elliott School of International Affairs]], [[George Washington University School of Public Health and Health Services|School of Public Health and Health Services]], and [[The George Washington University Graduate School of Education and Human Development|Graduate School of Education & Human Development]].

(September, 1988). \"Black kings of ancient America\", Science Digest, 74-77 and 122.  See also Wiercinski, A. (1972a) \"An anthropological study on the origin of 'Olmecs'\", Swiatowit, 33, p. 143-174.</ref> He supports this claim with [[Human cranium|cranial]] evidence from two Mesoamerican sites: [[Tlatilco]] and [[Cerro de las Mesas]]. Tlatilco is a site in the [[Valley of Mexico]].  Although outside the [[Olmec heartland]], Olmec influences appear in the architectural record.  The crania were from the Pre-Classic period, contemporary with the Olmec. Cerro de las Mesa is within the Olmec heartland, although according to Wiercinski, \"the series . . . is dated on the Classic period.\"<ref>Wiercinski (1972b).</ref>  The Classic period is generally defined to start around AD 250, or 600 years after the end of the Olmec culture.\n\nTo determine the racial heritage of the skeletons, Wiercinski used classic diagnostic traits, determined by [[Craniometry|craniometric and cranioscopic]] methods, as well as the Polish Comparative-Morphological School skeletal reference collection.  These measurements were then compared against three crania sets from Poland, Mongolia and Uganda to represent three racial categories which allowed Wiercinski to sort each skull into one or more racial categories.\n\nBased on his comparisons, Wiercinski found that 14% of the skeletons from Tlatilco and 4.5% of the skeletons from Cerro de las Mesas had elements of \"Black\" racial composition.\n\nIn the last section of his paper, Wiercinski compared the physiognomy of the skeletons to corresponding examples of Olmec sculptures and bas-reliefs on the [[stela]]s. For example, Wiercinski states that the colossal Olmec heads represent the \"Dongolan\" type.<ref>Wiercinski (1972b), p.160</ref>  The empirical frequencies of the Dongolan type at Tlatilco calculated by Wiercinski was 0.231, more than twice as high as Wiercinski's theoretical figure of 0.101, for the presence of Dongolans at Tlatilco.\n\nWiercinski summarizes his research by offering the following \"ethnogenetical hypotheses\":<ref>Wiercinski, p. 158 or p. 171.</ref>\n\n* The indigenous rootstock of Tlatilco and Cerro de las Mesas consists of \"Ainoid, Arctic, and Pacific racial elements\".\n* \"A next migratory wave\" brought in additional Pacific as well as \"Laponoid\" elements.\n* \"Some Chinese influence of Shang Period could penetrate Mesoamerica\"\n* \"A strange transatlantic, more or less sporadic migration\" brought [[Armenoid]], Equatorial, and [[Bushmen]]oid elements.\n\nWiercinski's research methods and conclusions are not accepted by the vast majority of Mesoamerican scholars, in part because of his reliance on the Polish Comparative-Morphological methodology which limits the placement of skull types within a very narrow spectrum that is often within Caucasoid, Negroid, and Mongoloid. Native Americans are thus made to fit within these groups which often yields false and contradictory assumptions as a result of sample bias.\n\nAn interdisciplinary analysis of Native American skulls has shown that there is no real evidence, apart from superficial misjudgments and erroneous conclusions, that Native Americans have any link to an African presence in America before the European encounter.<ref>Rolando Gonz\u00e1lez-Jos\u00e9 et al.

Tlatilco is a site in the [[Valley of Mexico]].  Although outside the [[Olmec heartland]], Olmec influences appear in the architectural record.  The crania were from the Pre-Classic period, contemporary with the Olmec. Cerro de las Mesa is within the Olmec heartland, although according to Wiercinski, \"the series . . . is dated on the Classic period.\"<ref>Wiercinski (1972b).</ref>  The Classic period is generally defined to start around AD 250, or 600 years after the end of the Olmec culture.\n\nTo determine the racial heritage of the skeletons, Wiercinski used classic diagnostic traits, determined by [[Craniometry|craniometric and cranioscopic]] methods, as well as the Polish Comparative-Morphological School skeletal reference collection.  These measurements were then compared against three crania sets from Poland, Mongolia and Uganda to represent three racial categories which allowed Wiercinski to sort each skull into one or more racial categories.\n\nBased on his comparisons, Wiercinski found that 14% of the skeletons from Tlatilco and 4.5% of the skeletons from Cerro de las Mesas had elements of \"Black\" racial composition.\n\nIn the last section of his paper, Wiercinski compared the physiognomy of the skeletons to corresponding examples of Olmec sculptures and bas-reliefs on the [[stela]]s. For example, Wiercinski states that the colossal Olmec heads represent the \"Dongolan\" type.<ref>Wiercinski (1972b), p.160</ref>  The empirical frequencies of the Dongolan type at Tlatilco calculated by Wiercinski was 0.231, more than twice as high as Wiercinski's theoretical figure of 0.101, for the presence of Dongolans at Tlatilco.\n\nWiercinski summarizes his research by offering the following \"ethnogenetical hypotheses\":<ref>Wiercinski, p. 158 or p. 171.</ref>\n\n* The indigenous rootstock of Tlatilco and Cerro de las Mesas consists of \"Ainoid, Arctic, and Pacific racial elements\".\n* \"A next migratory wave\" brought in additional Pacific as well as \"Laponoid\" elements.\n* \"Some Chinese influence of Shang Period could penetrate Mesoamerica\"\n* \"A strange transatlantic, more or less sporadic migration\" brought [[Armenoid]], Equatorial, and [[Bushmen]]oid elements.\n\nWiercinski's research methods and conclusions are not accepted by the vast majority of Mesoamerican scholars, in part because of his reliance on the Polish Comparative-Morphological methodology which limits the placement of skull types within a very narrow spectrum that is often within Caucasoid, Negroid, and Mongoloid. Native Americans are thus made to fit within these groups which often yields false and contradictory assumptions as a result of sample bias.\n\nAn interdisciplinary analysis of Native American skulls has shown that there is no real evidence, apart from superficial misjudgments and erroneous conclusions, that Native Americans have any link to an African presence in America before the European encounter.<ref>Rolando Gonz\u00e1lez-Jos\u00e9 et al.
