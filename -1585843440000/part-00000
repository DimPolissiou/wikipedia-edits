Social ties with a spouse, family, friends and wider networks through work, clubs or social organisations are of particular importance, while physical exercise and the practice of meditation may also contribute to happiness. Happiness may rise with increasing financial income, though it may plateau or even fall when no further gains are made.<ref>{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1037/0003-066X.60.5.410|pmid = 16045394|title = Positive Psychology Progress: Empirical Validation of Interventions|journal = American Psychologist|volume = 60|issue = 5|pages = 410\u2013421|year = 2005|last1 = Seligman|first1 = Martin E.

While not attempting a strict definition of the good life, positive psychologists agree that one must live a [[Happiness|happy]], engaged, and meaningful life in order to experience \"the good life\". [[Martin Seligman]] referred to \"the good life\" as \"using your signature strengths every day to produce authentic [[happiness]] and abundant gratification\".{{sfn|Seligman|2002|p=13}} \n\nPositive psychology complements, without intending to replace or ignore, the traditional areas of [[psychology]]. By emphasizing the study of positive human development this field helps to balance other approaches that focus on disorder, and which may produce only limited understanding.{{sfn|Peterson|2009}} Positive psychology has also placed a significant emphasis on fostering positive self-esteem and self-image, though positive psychologists with a less humanist bent are less likely to focus as intently on the matter. <ref>{{cite journal|last1=Mruk|first1=Christopher|title=The Psychology of Self-Esteem: A Potential Common Ground for Humanistic Positive Psychology and Positivistic Positive Psychology|journal=The Humanistic Psychologist|date=April 2008|volume=36|issue=2|pages=143\u2013158|doi=10.1080/08873260802111176|id={{ProQuest|212086932}}}}</ref>\n\nThe basic premise of positive psychology is that human beings are often drawn by the future more than they are driven by the past. A change in our orientation to time can dramatically affect how we think about the nature of happiness. Seligman identified other possible goals: families and schools that allow children to grow, workplaces that aim for satisfaction and high productivity, and teaching others about positive psychology.<ref name=\"SeligmanMartin\">Seligman, Martin E.P. \"Positive Psychology Center.\" Positive Psychology Center.

That being noted, accomplishments can activate the other elements of PERMA, such as pride, under positive emotion.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://awesomeculture.com/2011/09/13/the-science-of-a-happy-startup/|title=The Science of a Happy Startup}}</ref> Accomplishments can be individual or community-based, fun- or work-based.\n\nEach of the five PERMA elements was selected according to three criteria:\n# It contributes to well-being.\n# It is pursued for its own sake.\n# It is defined and measured independently of the other elements.\n\n===''Character  Strengths and Virtues''===\n{{main|Character Strengths and Virtues}}\n{{also|Character education|Values education|Values in Action Inventory of Strengths}}\n\nThe development of the ''[[Character Strengths and Virtues (book)|Character Strengths and Virtues]]'' (CSV) handbook (2004) represented the first attempt by Seligman and Peterson to identify and classify positive psychological traits of human beings. Much like the ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]'' (DSM) of general psychology, the CSV provided a theoretical framework to assist in understanding strengths and virtues and for developing practical applications for positive psychology. This manual identified 6 classes of [[virtues]] (i.e., \"core virtues\"), underlying 24 measurable character strengths.{{sfn|Peterson|Seligman|2004}}\n\nThe CSV suggested these 6 virtues have a historical basis in the vast majority of cultures; in addition, these virtues and strengths can lead to increased happiness when built upon. Notwithstanding numerous cautions and caveats, this suggestion of universality hints threefold: 1. The study of positive human qualities broadens the scope of psychological research to include mental wellness, 2. the leaders of the positive psychology movement are challenging [[moral relativism]], suggesting people are \"evolutionarily predisposed\" toward certain virtues, and 3. virtue has a biological basis.{{sfn|Peterson|Seligman|2004|p=51}}\n\nThe organization of the 6 virtues and 24 strengths is as follows:\n# '''[[Wisdom]] and knowledge:''' [[creativity]], [[curiosity]], [[Toleration|open-mindedness]], [[love of learning]], [[wisdom|perspective]], [[innovation]]\n# '''Courage:''' [[bravery]], [[persistence (psychology)|persistence]], [[integrity]], [[vitality]], [[Zest (positive psychology)|zest]]\n# '''Humanity:''' [[love]], [[kindness]], [[social intelligence]]\n# '''Justice:''' [[active citizenship|citizenship]], fairness, [[leadership]]\n# '''Temperance:''' [[forgiveness]] and [[mercy]], [[humility]], [[prudence]], [[self-control|self control]]\n# '''Transcendence:''' [[appreciation of beauty]] and [[excellence]], [[gratitude]], [[hope]], [[humor]], [[spirituality]]\n\nRecent research challenged the need for 6 virtues. Instead, researchers suggested the 24 strengths are more accurately grouped into just 3 or 4 categories: Intellectual Strengths, Interpersonal Strengths, and Temperance Strengths<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Shryack | first1 = J. | last2 = Steger | first2 = M.

Flow is characterized by intense concentration, loss of self-awareness, a feeling of being perfectly challenged (neither bored nor overwhelmed), and a sense that \"time is flying\". Flow is intrinsically rewarding; it can also assist in the achievement of goals (e.g., winning a game) or improving skills (e.g., becoming a better chess player).<ref name=Csikszentmihalyi1990>{{Cite book | last1 = Csikszentmihalyi | first1 = Mihaly | title = Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience | year = 1990 | publisher = Harper & Row | location = New York | isbn = 978-0-06-016253-5 }}</ref> Anyone can experience flow, in different domains, such as play, creativity, and work. Flow is achieved when the challenge of the situation meets one's personal abilities. A mismatch of challenge for someone of low skills results in a state of anxiety; insufficient challenge for someone highly skilled results in boredom.<ref name=Csikszentmihalyi1990/>\n\n==Applications and research findings==\n{{Main|Well-being contributing factors}}\n\nResearch in positive psychology, well-being, eudaimonia and happiness, and the theories of Diener, Ryff, Keyes and Seligman cover a broad range of topics including \"the biological, personal, relational, institutional, cultural, and global dimensions of life\".{{sfn|Seligman|Csikszentmihalyi|2000}} A [[meta-analysis]] on 49 studies in 2009 showed that Positive Psychology Interventions (PPI) produced improvements in well-being and lower depression levels, the PPIs studied included writing gratitude letters, learning optimistic thinking, replaying positive life experiences and socializing with others.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Enhancing Well-Being and Alleviating Depressive Symptoms With Positive Psychology Interventions:A Practice-Friendly Meta-Analysis|author1=Nancy L.

Three to six months after a PPI the effects for subjective well-being and psychological well-being were still significant. However the positive effect was weaker than in the 2009 meta analysis, the authors concluded that this was because they only used higher quality studies. The PPIs they considered included counting blessings, [[kindness]] practices, making personal goals, showing gratitude and focusing on personal strengths.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Positive psychology interventions: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled studies|author1=Linda Bolier|display-authors=etal|journal=BMC Public Health|year=2013|volume=13|issue=119|pages=119|doi=10.1186/1471-2458-13-119|pmid=23390882|pmc=3599475}}</ref>\n\nIlona Boniwell, in her book ''Positive Psychology in a Nutshell'', provided the following summary of the current research. Wellbeing is related to optimism, extraversion, social connections (i.e. close friendships), being married, having engaging work, religion or spirituality, leisure, good sleep and exercise, social class (through lifestyle differences and better coping methods) and subjective health (what you think about your health). Wellbeing is not related to age, physical attractiveness, money (once basic needs are met), gender (women are more often depressed but also more often joyful), educational level, having children (although they add meaning to life), moving to a sunnier climate, crime prevention, housing and objective health (what doctors say).<ref>Positive Psychology in a Nutshell, Ilona Boniwell, Open University Press, 2012, p.44</ref>\n\n[[Sonja Lyubomirsky]], in her book ''The How Of Happiness'', says that to improve happiness individuals should create new habits; they can seek out new emotions, use variety and timing to prevent hedonic adaptation and enlist others to motivate and support during the creation of those new habits.<ref>The How of Happiness, Sonja Lyubomirsky, 2007, Piatkus, p.270-p.294</ref> Lyubomirsky gives 12 happiness activities such as savouring life, learning to forgive and living in the present, each of which could become the basis for a new habit.\n\nIn ''Positive Psychology: The Science of Happiness'', the authors Compton and Hoffman give the \"Top Down Predictors\" of wellbeing as high [[self esteem]], [[optimism]], [[self efficacy]], a sense of meaning in life and positive relationships with others. The personality traits most associated with well being are [[extraversion]], [[agreeability]] and low levels of [[neuroticism]].<ref>Positive Psychology The Science of Happiness, William C. Compton and Edward Hoffman, Wadsworth, 2005, p.55-p.62</ref>\n\nIn the ''Journal of Occupational Rehabilitation'', Kreutzer and Mills argue for the principles of positive psychology to be implemented to assist those recovering from traumatic brain injury (TBR). They make the case that TBI rehabilitation practices rely on the betterment of the individual through engaging in everyday practices, a practice significantly related to tenets of positive psychology.{{sfn|Mills|Kreutzer|2016}} Their proposal to connect positive psychology with TBI vocational rehabilitation (VR) also looks at happiness and its correlation with improvements in mental health, including increased confidence and productivity, as well as others.{{sfn|Mills|Kreutzer|2016}} While the authors point out that empirical evidence for positive psychology is limited, they clarify that positive psychology's focus on small successes, optimism and prosocial behaviour is promising for improvements in the social and emotional well-being of TBI patients.{{sfn|Mills|Kreutzer|2016}}\n\n==Criticism==\nAccording to [[Kirk J. Schneider|Kirk Schneider]], positive psychology fails to explain past heinous behaviors such as those perpetrated by the Nazi party, Stalinist marches and Klan gatherings, to identify but a few. Furthermore, Schneider pointed to a body of research showing high positivity correlates with positive illusion, which effectively distorts reality.<ref name=\"Schneider, K. 2011\">{{cite journal|author=Schneider, K.|year=2011|title=Toward a Humanistic Positive Psychology|journal=Existential Analysis: Journal of the Society for Existential Analysis|volume=22|issue=1|pages=32\u201338}}</ref> The extent of the downfall of high positivity (also known as flourishing) is one could become incapable of psychological growth, unable to self-reflect, and tend to hold racial biases.  By contrast, negativity, sometimes evidenced in mild to moderate depression, is correlated with less distortion of reality. Therefore, negativity might play an important role within the dynamics of human flourishing.  To illustrate, conflict engagement and acknowledgement of appropriate negativity, including certain negative emotions like guilt, might better promote flourishing.<ref name=\"Fredrickson, B.

Held]] argued that while positive psychology makes contributions to the field of psychology, it has its faults. She offered insight into topics including the negative side effects of positive psychology, negativity within the positive psychology movement, and the current division in the field of psychology caused by differing opinions of psychologists on positive psychology. In addition, she noted the movement's lack of consistency regarding the role of negativity. She also raised issues with the simplistic approach taken by some psychologists in the application of positive psychology. A \"one size fits all\" approach is arguably not beneficial to the advancement of the field of positive psychology; she suggested a need for individual differences to be incorporated into its application.{{sfn|Held|2004}}\n\nMartin Jack has also maintained that positive psychology is not unique in its optimistic approach to looking at optimal emotional wellbeing, stating that other forms of psychology, such as counselling and educational psychology, are also interested in positive human fulfillment. He goes on to mention that, while positive psychology has pushed for schools to be more student-centred and able to foster positive self-images in children, he worries that a lack of focus on self-control may prevent children from making full contributions to society. <ref>{{cite journal|last1=Martin|first1=Jack|title=Self Research in Educational Psychology: A Cautionary Tale of Positive Psychology in Action.|journal=The Journal of Psychology|date=2006|volume=140|issue=4|pages=307\u201316|doi=10.3200/JRLP.140.4.307-316|pmid=16967738|id={{ProQuest|213832759}}}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=18em}}\n;Precursors\n* [[New Thought]]\n* [[Maslow's hierarchy of needs]]\n* Needs and Motives ([[Henry Murray]])\n\n;Various\n* ''[[Anatomy of an Epidemic]]''\n* [[Aversion to happiness]]\n* [[Louise Burfitt-Dons]]\n* [[Culture and positive psychology]]\n* [[Happiness economics]]\n* [[Meaning of life]]\n* [[Positive education]]\n* [[Positive Neuroscience]]\n* [[Positive youth development]]\n* [[Posttraumatic growth]]\n* [[Pragmatism]]\n* [[Psychological resilience]]\n* [[Rational ignorance]]\n* [[Second wave positive psychology]]\n* [[Sex-positive movement]]\n* [[Theory of humor]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist|35em}}\n\n==References==\n===Footnotes===\n{{reflist|22em}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n{{refbegin|indent=yes|35em}}\n: {{cite book |last=Compton |first=William C. |year=2005 |title=An Introduction to Positive Psychology |location=Belmont, California |publisher=Wadsworth Publishing |isbn=978-0-534-64453-6 |ref=harv |url=https://archive.org/details/introductiontopo0000comp }}\n: {{cite journal |last=Held |first=Barbara S. |author-link=Barbara S.

While not attempting a strict definition of the good life, positive psychologists agree that one must live a [[Happiness|happy]], engaged, and meaningful life in order to experience \"the good life\". [[Martin Seligman]] referred to \"the good life\" as \"using your signature strengths every day to produce authentic [[happiness]] and abundant gratification\".{{sfn|Seligman|2002|p=13}} \n\nPositive psychology complements, without intending to replace or ignore, the traditional areas of [[psychology]]. By emphasizing the study of positive human development this field helps to balance other approaches that focus on disorder, and which may produce only limited understanding.{{sfn|Peterson|2009}} Positive psychology has also placed a significant emphasis on fostering positive self-esteem and self-image, though positive psychologists with a less humanist bent are less likely to focus as intently on the matter. <ref>{{cite journal|last1=Mruk|first1=Christopher|title=The Psychology of Self-Esteem: A Potential Common Ground for Humanistic Positive Psychology and Positivistic Positive Psychology|journal=The Humanistic Psychologist|date=April 2008|volume=36|issue=2|pages=143\u2013158|doi=10.1080/08873260802111176|id={{ProQuest|212086932}}}}</ref>\n\nThe basic premise of positive psychology is that human beings are often drawn by the future more than they are driven by the past. A change in our orientation to time can dramatically affect how we think about the nature of happiness. Seligman identified other possible goals: families and schools that allow children to grow, workplaces that aim for satisfaction and high productivity, and teaching others about positive psychology.<ref name=\"SeligmanMartin\">Seligman, Martin E.P. \"Positive Psychology Center.\" Positive Psychology Center.

It is typical that most positive things take place in the presence of other people.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://health.usnews.com/health-news/family-health/brain-and-behavior/articles/2009/06/24/using-positive-psychology-in-your-relationships|title=Using Positive Psychology in Your Relationships}}</ref>\n* ''Meaning'' is also known as purpose, and prompts the question of \"why\". Discovering and figuring out a clear \"why\" puts everything into context from work to relationships to other parts of life.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/john-murphy/why-do-you-do-what-you-do_b_3873650.html|title=Why do You do What You Do?|date=2013-09-06}}</ref> Finding meaning is learning that there is something greater than one's self. Despite potential challenges, working with meaning drives people to continue striving for a desirable goal.\n* ''Accomplishments'' are the pursuit of success and mastery.{{sfn|Seligman|2011|loc=ch.&nbsp;1}} Unlike the other parts of PERMA, they are sometimes pursued even when accomplishments do not result in positive emotions, meaning, or relationships. That being noted, accomplishments can activate the other elements of PERMA, such as pride, under positive emotion.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://awesomeculture.com/2011/09/13/the-science-of-a-happy-startup/|title=The Science of a Happy Startup}}</ref> Accomplishments can be individual or community-based, fun- or work-based.\n\nEach of the five PERMA elements was selected according to three criteria:\n# It contributes to well-being.\n# It is pursued for its own sake.\n# It is defined and measured independently of the other elements.\n\n===''Character  Strengths and Virtues''===\n{{main|Character Strengths and Virtues}}\n{{also|Character education|Values education|Values in Action Inventory of Strengths}}\n\nThe development of the ''[[Character Strengths and Virtues (book)|Character Strengths and Virtues]]'' (CSV) handbook (2004) represented the first attempt by Seligman and Peterson to identify and classify positive psychological traits of human beings. Much like the ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]'' (DSM) of general psychology, the CSV provided a theoretical framework to assist in understanding strengths and virtues and for developing practical applications for positive psychology. This manual identified 6 classes of [[virtues]] (i.e., \"core virtues\"), underlying 24 measurable character strengths.{{sfn|Peterson|Seligman|2004}}\n\nThe CSV suggested these 6 virtues have a historical basis in the vast majority of cultures; in addition, these virtues and strengths can lead to increased happiness when built upon. Notwithstanding numerous cautions and caveats, this suggestion of universality hints threefold: 1. The study of positive human qualities broadens the scope of psychological research to include mental wellness, 2. the leaders of the positive psychology movement are challenging [[moral relativism]], suggesting people are \"evolutionarily predisposed\" toward certain virtues, and 3. virtue has a biological basis.{{sfn|Peterson|Seligman|2004|p=51}}\n\nThe organization of the 6 virtues and 24 strengths is as follows:\n# '''[[Wisdom]] and knowledge:''' [[creativity]], [[curiosity]], [[Toleration|open-mindedness]], [[love of learning]], [[wisdom|perspective]], [[innovation]]\n# '''Courage:''' [[bravery]], [[persistence (psychology)|persistence]], [[integrity]], [[vitality]], [[Zest (positive psychology)|zest]]\n# '''Humanity:''' [[love]], [[kindness]], [[social intelligence]]\n# '''Justice:''' [[active citizenship|citizenship]], fairness, [[leadership]]\n# '''Temperance:''' [[forgiveness]] and [[mercy]], [[humility]], [[prudence]], [[self-control|self control]]\n# '''Transcendence:''' [[appreciation of beauty]] and [[excellence]], [[gratitude]], [[hope]], [[humor]], [[spirituality]]\n\nRecent research challenged the need for 6 virtues. Instead, researchers suggested the 24 strengths are more accurately grouped into just 3 or 4 categories: Intellectual Strengths, Interpersonal Strengths, and Temperance Strengths<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Shryack | first1 = J. | last2 = Steger | first2 = M.

Flow is characterized by intense concentration, loss of self-awareness, a feeling of being perfectly challenged (neither bored nor overwhelmed), and a sense that \"time is flying\". Flow is intrinsically rewarding; it can also assist in the achievement of goals (e.g., winning a game) or improving skills (e.g., becoming a better chess player).<ref name=Csikszentmihalyi1990>{{Cite book | last1 = Csikszentmihalyi | first1 = Mihaly | title = Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience | year = 1990 | publisher = Harper & Row | location = New York | isbn = 978-0-06-016253-5 }}</ref> Anyone can experience flow, in different domains, such as play, creativity, and work. Flow is achieved when the challenge of the situation meets one's personal abilities. A mismatch of challenge for someone of low skills results in a state of anxiety; insufficient challenge for someone highly skilled results in boredom.<ref name=Csikszentmihalyi1990/>\n\n==Applications and research findings==\n{{Main|Well-being contributing factors}}\n\nResearch in positive psychology, well-being, eudaimonia and happiness, and the theories of Diener, Ryff, Keyes and Seligman cover a broad range of topics including \"the biological, personal, relational, institutional, cultural, and global dimensions of life\".{{sfn|Seligman|Csikszentmihalyi|2000}} A [[meta-analysis]] on 49 studies in 2009 showed that Positive Psychology Interventions (PPI) produced improvements in well-being and lower depression levels, the PPIs studied included writing gratitude letters, learning optimistic thinking, replaying positive life experiences and socializing with others.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Enhancing Well-Being and Alleviating Depressive Symptoms With Positive Psychology Interventions:A Practice-Friendly Meta-Analysis|author1=Nancy L.

Three to six months after a PPI the effects for subjective well-being and psychological well-being were still significant. However the positive effect was weaker than in the 2009 meta analysis, the authors concluded that this was because they only used higher quality studies. The PPIs they considered included counting blessings, [[kindness]] practices, making personal goals, showing gratitude and focusing on personal strengths.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Positive psychology interventions: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled studies|author1=Linda Bolier|display-authors=etal|journal=BMC Public Health|year=2013|volume=13|issue=119|pages=119|doi=10.1186/1471-2458-13-119|pmid=23390882|pmc=3599475}}</ref>\n\nIlona Boniwell, in her book ''Positive Psychology in a Nutshell'', provided the following summary of the current research. Wellbeing is related to optimism, extraversion, social connections (i.e. close friendships), being married, having engaging work, religion or spirituality, leisure, good sleep and exercise, social class (through lifestyle differences and better coping methods) and subjective health (what you think about your health). Wellbeing is not related to age, physical attractiveness, money (once basic needs are met), gender (women are more often depressed but also more often joyful), educational level, having children (although they add meaning to life), moving to a sunnier climate, crime prevention, housing and objective health (what doctors say).<ref>Positive Psychology in a Nutshell, Ilona Boniwell, Open University Press, 2012, p.44</ref>\n\n[[Sonja Lyubomirsky]], in her book ''The How Of Happiness'', says that to improve happiness individuals should create new habits; they can seek out new emotions, use variety and timing to prevent hedonic adaptation and enlist others to motivate and support during the creation of those new habits.<ref>The How of Happiness, Sonja Lyubomirsky, 2007, Piatkus, p.270-p.294</ref> Lyubomirsky gives 12 happiness activities such as savouring life, learning to forgive and living in the present, each of which could become the basis for a new habit.\n\nIn ''Positive Psychology: The Science of Happiness'', the authors Compton and Hoffman give the \"Top Down Predictors\" of wellbeing as high [[self esteem]], [[optimism]], [[self efficacy]], a sense of meaning in life and positive relationships with others. The personality traits most associated with well being are [[extraversion]], [[agreeability]] and low levels of [[neuroticism]].<ref>Positive Psychology The Science of Happiness, William C. Compton and Edward Hoffman, Wadsworth, 2005, p.55-p.62</ref>\n\nIn the ''Journal of Occupational Rehabilitation'', Kreutzer and Mills argue for the principles of positive psychology to be implemented to assist those recovering from traumatic brain injury (TBR). They make the case that TBI rehabilitation practices rely on the betterment of the individual through engaging in everyday practices, a practice significantly related to tenets of positive psychology.{{sfn|Mills|Kreutzer|2016}} Their proposal to connect positive psychology with TBI vocational rehabilitation (VR) also looks at happiness and its correlation with improvements in mental health, including increased confidence and productivity, as well as others.{{sfn|Mills|Kreutzer|2016}} While the authors point out that empirical evidence for positive psychology is limited, they clarify that positive psychology's focus on small successes, optimism and prosocial behaviour is promising for improvements in the social and emotional well-being of TBI patients.{{sfn|Mills|Kreutzer|2016}}\n\n==Criticism==\nAccording to [[Kirk J. Schneider|Kirk Schneider]], positive psychology fails to explain past heinous behaviors such as those perpetrated by the Nazi party, Stalinist marches and Klan gatherings, to identify but a few. Furthermore, Schneider pointed to a body of research showing high positivity correlates with positive illusion, which effectively distorts reality.<ref name=\"Schneider, K. 2011\">{{cite journal|author=Schneider, K.|year=2011|title=Toward a Humanistic Positive Psychology|journal=Existential Analysis: Journal of the Society for Existential Analysis|volume=22|issue=1|pages=32\u201338}}</ref> The extent of the downfall of high positivity (also known as flourishing) is one could become incapable of psychological growth, unable to self-reflect, and tend to hold racial biases.  By contrast, negativity, sometimes evidenced in mild to moderate depression, is correlated with less distortion of reality. Therefore, negativity might play an important role within the dynamics of human flourishing.  To illustrate, conflict engagement and acknowledgement of appropriate negativity, including certain negative emotions like guilt, might better promote flourishing.<ref name=\"Fredrickson, B.

Held]] argued that while positive psychology makes contributions to the field of psychology, it has its faults. She offered insight into topics including the negative side effects of positive psychology, negativity within the positive psychology movement, and the current division in the field of psychology caused by differing opinions of psychologists on positive psychology. In addition, she noted the movement's lack of consistency regarding the role of negativity. She also raised issues with the simplistic approach taken by some psychologists in the application of positive psychology. A \"one size fits all\" approach is arguably not beneficial to the advancement of the field of positive psychology; she suggested a need for individual differences to be incorporated into its application.{{sfn|Held|2004}}\n\nMartin Jack has also maintained that positive psychology is not unique in its optimistic approach to looking at optimal emotional wellbeing, stating that other forms of psychology, such as counselling and educational psychology, are also interested in positive human fulfillment. He goes on to mention that, while positive psychology has pushed for schools to be more student-centred and able to foster positive self-images in children, he worries that a lack of focus on self-control may prevent children from making full contributions to society. <ref>{{cite journal|last1=Martin|first1=Jack|title=Self Research in Educational Psychology: A Cautionary Tale of Positive Psychology in Action.|journal=The Journal of Psychology|date=2006|volume=140|issue=4|pages=307\u201316|doi=10.3200/JRLP.140.4.307-316|pmid=16967738|id={{ProQuest|213832759}}}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=18em}}\n;Precursors\n* [[New Thought]]\n* [[Maslow's hierarchy of needs]]\n* Needs and Motives ([[Henry Murray]])\n\n;Various\n* ''[[Anatomy of an Epidemic]]''\n* [[Aversion to happiness]]\n* [[Louise Burfitt-Dons]]\n* [[Culture and positive psychology]]\n* [[Happiness economics]]\n* [[Meaning of life]]\n* [[Positive education]]\n* [[Positive Neuroscience]]\n* [[Positive youth development]]\n* [[Posttraumatic growth]]\n* [[Pragmatism]]\n* [[Psychological resilience]]\n* [[Rational ignorance]]\n* [[Second wave positive psychology]]\n* [[Sex-positive movement]]\n* [[Theory of humor]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist|35em}}\n\n==References==\n===Footnotes===\n{{reflist|22em}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n{{refbegin|indent=yes|35em}}\n: {{cite book |last=Compton |first=William C. |year=2005 |title=An Introduction to Positive Psychology |location=Belmont, California |publisher=Wadsworth Publishing |isbn=978-0-534-64453-6 |ref=harv |url=https://archive.org/details/introductiontopo0000comp }}\n: {{cite journal |last=Held |first=Barbara S. |author-link=Barbara S.

In the game, the player assumes the role of a pirates who must complete voyages from different trading companies in order to become the ultimate pirate legends. Played from a [[first-person perspective]], ''Sea of Thieves'' allows a group of players to explore an [[open world]] via a pirate ship, and players must coordinate with each other while they are controlling the ship. The game was described as a \"[[shared world]] adventure game\", which means groups of players will encounter each other regularly throughout their adventures.\n\nNearly all the staff members from Rare worked on the title. The game was inspired by players of [[personal computer|PC]] games such as ''[[Eve Online]]'', ''[[DayZ (video game)|DayZ]]'' and ''[[Rust (video game)|Rust]]'', who used the tools provided by these games to create their own personal stories. The team considered using other themes such as [[vampire]]s and [[dinosaur]]s before settling on the pirate theme, and the team drew inspirations from titles such as ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean]]'' and ''[[The Goonies]]''. The game features a progression system that only unlocks cosmetic items as they wanted to make the title more accessible and encourage players of different experience to play together. Unlike the development of Rare's other games, the development process was transparent, with Rare inviting fans to test the game's early builds.\n\nMicrosoft released the game in March 2018 for [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] and [[Xbox One]] and it was released for [[Xbox Game Pass]] subscribers at launch. The game received generally mixed reviews upon release, with critics praising the game's ship combat, multiplayer gameplay, visuals and game physics. Criticisms were directed at the game's lack of content, progression and shallow gameplay. Rare envisioned the title as a \"[[game as a service]]\" and released numerous content updates after the game's release. The game was a commercial success, attracting more than 10 million players as of January 2020, prompting Microsoft to declare it the most successful new [[intellectual property]] (IP) they have released in the [[Eighth generation of video game consoles|generation]].\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:Sea of Thieves gameplay screenshot.jpg|thumb|left|In this gameplay screenshot, the player is firing cannonballs at a hostile pirate ship, which is controlled by another group of players.]]\n\n''Sea of Thieves'' is an [[action-adventure game|action-adventure]] video game played from a [[first-person (video games)|first-person perspective]].

Joe Neate, the game's executive director, described the game as an \"improv\" comedy, and added that the game is about going \"off-script\".<ref name=\"friendliest\"/> Rare shaped the world and the game's lore to reflect players' action, including various [[Easter egg (media)|easter egg]]s to celebrate their actions or achievements.

Designer Mike Chapman also believed a lot of parallels can be drawn between ''Sea of Thieves'' and ''[[The Goonies]]'', which is about a group of friends bonding together as they attempt to seek a treasure, and in the process creating a journey that all of them would fondly remember.<ref name=\"DigitalTrend making\"/> Neate added that the game's goal was to evoke \"[a] sense of travel and exploration and discovery\".<ref name=\"voice\">{{cite web|url=https://www.polygon.com/2018/10/22/17971710/sea-of-thieves-lore-forsaken-shores-cursed-sails-worldbuilding|title=Sea of Thieves\u2019 lore is surprisingly deep, silly and refreshing|first=Cass|last=Marshall|work=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]|date=22 October 2018|accessdate=25 March 2020}}</ref> The team implemented the \"infinite pirate generator\" instead of allowing players to customize their avatar as they feared that some players would create \"abominations\" that would not have fit the game's visual style.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/317084/How_Rare_designed_Sea_of_Thieves_infinite_pirate_generator.php|title=How Rare designed Sea of Thieves' infinite pirate generator|first=Jack|last=Yarwood|work=[[Gamasutra]]|date=27 April 2018|accessdate=25 March 2020}}</ref> The game features a stylized visual style with hand-painted textures.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gdcvault.com/play/1025015/Visual-Adventures-on-Sea-of|title=Visual Adventures on 'Sea of Thieves'|work=GDC Vault|first=Ryan|last=Stevenson|accessdate=25 March 2020}}</ref> Duncan added that the team chose this painted artstyle because they wanted it to be \"timeless\" and refleccted the game's \"joyful\" and \"delightful\" world.<ref name=\"art\"/>\n\n===Gameplay design===\n\nThe team considered progression-driven experiences as a drawback as this caused experienced players to focus on grinding for endgame content instead of playing with other players, and that novice players may have to worry about their progression lagging significantly behind the more experienced ones. Therefore, the team introduced a \"horizontal\" progression, where players would only earn cosmetic items as they achieve a higher rank. All items have the same attributes, meaning that new players would not be easily margainalized. With the progression system, instead of separating players from each other, more experienced players can assist the novice players to finish the voyages, thus reducing the barrier between the two.<ref name=\"DigitalTrend making\"/> The team hoped that this would encourage players to play with each other regardless of their experience and levels.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gamesradar.com/sea-of-thieves-has-fully-embraced-power-levelling-according-to-the-design-director-its-not-what-you-think/|title=Sea of Thieves 'fully embraces' power levelling, according to the design director (it's not what you think)|first=Connor|last=Sheridan|work=[[GamesRadar]]|date=28 February 2018|accessdate=25 March 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"DigitalTrend making\"/> As a \"shared world\" adventure game, Rare opted to maintain the distance between each player in a server rather than limiting the number of players a server can accommodate.

Therefore, the game does not feature a tutorial at launch as the team wanted players to discover the game's mechanics by themselves.<ref name=\"DigitalTrend making\"/> The team wanted to give the players tools to play around with, and avoided setting gameplay rules so as to encourage players to utilize their creativity.<ref name=\"solo play\">{{cite web|url=https://www.mcvuk.com/development-news/when-we-made-sea-of-thieves/|title=When We Made\u2026 Sea of Thieves|first=Marie|last=Dealessandri|work=[[MCVUK]]|date=20 June 2019|accessdate=25 March 2020}}</ref> Despite this, Rare also included [[emergent gameplay]] in a more systemic manner, introducing shipwrecks and fonts that players can discover. Chapman described these locations of interest as the \"catalyst for stories\" which draw different players together, fostering cooperation or competition. Players may sometimes encounter [[sea monster]]s, which is a random incidence that adds a layer of unpredictability to the game.<ref name=\"DigitalTrend making\"/> Due to the game's emergent gameplay, ''Sea of Thieves'' was also considered as a \"watachable and sharable game\", and the team hoped that this will lure players who watched the game on [[video game live streaming|game live streaming]] platforms such as [[twitch (service)|Twitch]] or [[mixer (service)|Mixer]] to purchasing the game.<ref name=\"Watchable game\"/>\n\nWhile the game allows solo play, the game is designed to be a multiplayer game where players cooperate with each other.

In the game, the player assumes the role of a pirates who must complete voyages from different trading companies in order to become the ultimate pirate legends. Played from a [[first-person perspective]], ''Sea of Thieves'' allows a group of players to explore an [[open world]] via a pirate ship, and players must coordinate with each other while they are controlling the ship. The game was described as a \"[[shared world]] adventure game\", which means groups of players will encounter each other regularly throughout their adventures.\n\nNearly all the staff members from Rare worked on the title. The game was inspired by players of [[personal computer|PC]] games such as ''[[Eve Online]]'', ''[[DayZ (video game)|DayZ]]'' and ''[[Rust (video game)|Rust]]'', who used the tools provided by these games to create their own personal stories. The team considered using other themes such as [[vampire]]s and [[dinosaur]]s before settling on the pirate theme, and the team drew inspirations from titles such as ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean]]'' and ''[[The Goonies]]''. The game features a progression system that only unlocks cosmetic items as they wanted to make the title more accessible and encourage players of different experience to play together. Unlike the development of Rare's other games, the development process was transparent, with Rare inviting fans to test the game's early builds.\n\nMicrosoft released the game in March 2018 for [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] and [[Xbox One]] and it was released for [[Xbox Game Pass]] subscribers at launch. The game received generally mixed reviews upon release, with critics praising the game's ship combat, multiplayer gameplay, visuals and game physics. Criticisms were directed at the game's lack of content, progression and shallow gameplay. Rare envisioned the title as a \"[[game as a service]]\" and released numerous content updates after the game's release. The game was a commercial success, attracting more than 10 million players as of January 2020, prompting Microsoft to declare it the most successful new [[intellectual property]] (IP) they have released in the [[Eighth generation of video game consoles|generation]].\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:Sea of Thieves gameplay screenshot.jpg|thumb|left|In this gameplay screenshot, the player is firing cannonballs at a hostile pirate ship, which is controlled by another group of players.]]\n\n''Sea of Thieves'' is an [[action-adventure game|action-adventure]] video game played from a [[first-person (video games)|first-person perspective]].

Designer Mike Chapman also believed a lot of parallels can be drawn between ''Sea of Thieves'' and ''[[The Goonies]]'', which is about a group of friends bonding together as they attempt to seek a treasure, and in the process creating a journey that all of them would fondly remember.<ref name=\"DigitalTrend making\"/> Neate added that the game's goal was to evoke \"[a] sense of travel and exploration and discovery\".<ref name=\"voice\">{{cite web|url=https://www.polygon.com/2018/10/22/17971710/sea-of-thieves-lore-forsaken-shores-cursed-sails-worldbuilding|title=Sea of Thieves\u2019 lore is surprisingly deep, silly and refreshing|first=Cass|last=Marshall|work=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]|date=22 October 2018|accessdate=25 March 2020}}</ref> The team implemented the \"infinite pirate generator\" instead of allowing players to customize their avatar as they feared that some players would create \"abominations\" that would not have fit the game's visual style.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/317084/How_Rare_designed_Sea_of_Thieves_infinite_pirate_generator.php|title=How Rare designed Sea of Thieves' infinite pirate generator|first=Jack|last=Yarwood|work=[[Gamasutra]]|date=27 April 2018|accessdate=25 March 2020}}</ref> The game features a stylized visual style with hand-painted textures.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gdcvault.com/play/1025015/Visual-Adventures-on-Sea-of|title=Visual Adventures on 'Sea of Thieves'|work=GDC Vault|first=Ryan|last=Stevenson|accessdate=25 March 2020}}</ref> Duncan added that the team chose this painted artstyle because they wanted it to be \"timeless\" and refleccted the game's \"joyful\" and \"delightful\" world.<ref name=\"art\"/>\n\n===Gameplay design===\n\nThe team considered progression-driven experiences as a drawback as this caused experienced players to focus on grinding for endgame content instead of playing with other players, and that novice players may have to worry about their progression lagging significantly behind the more experienced ones. Therefore, the team introduced a \"horizontal\" progression, where players would only earn cosmetic items as they achieve a higher rank. All items have the same attributes, meaning that new players would not be easily margainalized. With the progression system, instead of separating players from each other, more experienced players can assist the novice players to finish the voyages, thus reducing the barrier between the two.<ref name=\"DigitalTrend making\"/> The team hoped that this would encourage players to play with each other regardless of their experience and levels.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gamesradar.com/sea-of-thieves-has-fully-embraced-power-levelling-according-to-the-design-director-its-not-what-you-think/|title=Sea of Thieves 'fully embraces' power levelling, according to the design director (it's not what you think)|first=Connor|last=Sheridan|work=[[GamesRadar]]|date=28 February 2018|accessdate=25 March 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"DigitalTrend making\"/> As a \"shared world\" adventure game, Rare opted to maintain the distance between each player in a server rather than limiting the number of players a server can accommodate.

Chapman described these locations of interest as the \"catalyst for stories\" which draw different players together, fostering cooperation or competition. Players may sometimes encounter [[sea monster]]s, which is a random incidence that adds a layer of unpredictability to the game.<ref name=\"DigitalTrend making\"/> Due to the game's emergent gameplay, ''Sea of Thieves'' was also considered as a \"watachable and sharable game\", and the team hoped that this will lure players who watched the game on [[video game live streaming|game live streaming]] platforms such as [[twitch (service)|Twitch]] or [[mixer (service)|Mixer]] to purchasing the game.<ref name=\"Watchable game\"/>\n\nWhile the game allows solo play, the game is designed to be a multiplayer game where players cooperate with each other.

''M\u0113\u1e37akarta'' ragas are parent ragas (hence known as ''janaka'' ragas) from which other ragas may be generated. A ''melakarta'' raga is sometimes referred as ''mela'', ''karta'' or ''sampurna'' as well, though the latter term is inaccurate, as a ''sampurna'' raga need not be a ''melakarta'' (take the raga ''Bhairavi,'' for example).\n\nIn [[Hindustani music]] the ''[[thaat]]'' is equivalent of ''Melakarta''. There are 10 ''thaats'' in Hindustani music, though the commonly accepted ''melakarta'' scheme has 72 ragas.\n\n==Rules for ''M\u0113\u1e37akarta Ragas''==\nRagas must contain the following characteristics to be considered ''Melakarta''.\n*They are ''[[sampurna raga]]s'' \u2013 they contain all seven ''[[swara]]s'' (notes) of the octave in both ascending and descending scale<ref name=\"ragas\">''Ragas in Carnatic music'' by Dr. S. Bhagyalekshmy, Pub. 1990, CBH Publications</ref><ref name=\"primer\" />\n*They are ''krama sampurna'' ragas \u2013 that is the sequence is strictly ascending and descending in the scales, without any jumps or zig-zag notes<ref name=\"primer\">''A practical course in Carnatic music'' by Prof. P. Sambamurthy, 15th edition published 1998, The Indian Music publishing house</ref>\n*The upper shadjam is included in the raga scale<ref name=\"primer\" /> (ragas like ''Punnagavarali'' and ''Chenchurutti'' are not ''m\u0113\u1e37akarta'' as they end with ''nishadam'')\n*The ascending and descending scales must have the same notes<ref name=\"primer\" />\n\n==History==\nThe ''m\u0113\u1e37a'' system of ragas was first propounded by Raamamaatya in his work [[Svaramelakalanidhi]] c. 1550. He is considered the father of ''mela'' system of ragas. Later, [[Venkatamakhin]], a gifted musicologist in the 17th century, expounded a new ''mela'' system known today as ''m\u0113\u1e37akarta'' in his work ''Chaturdandi Prakaasikaa''.<ref name=\"dikshitar\">Shree Muthuswami Dikshitar Keertanaigal, by A Sundaram Iyer, Madras Book Publications, Mylapore, Chennai</ref> He made some bold and controversial claims and defined somewhat arbitrarily 6 ''svaras'' from the known 12 semitones, at that time, to arrive at 72 ''m\u0113\u1e37akarta'' ragas. The controversial parts relate to double counting of R2 (and similar ''svaras'') and his exclusive selection of ''madyamas'' for which there is no specific reasoning (also known as ''asampurna melas'' as opposed to ''[[sampurna raga]]s'').  However, today the 72 ''m\u0113\u1e37akarta'' ragas use a standardized pattern, unlike Venkatamakhi's pattern, and have gained a significant following. Govindhacharya is credited with the standardization of rules and known for giving different names for standard ragas that have a different structure but the same swaras as those proposed by Venkatamakhi.<ref name=\"dikshitar\" /> The scales in this page are those proposed by Govindaacharya.\n\n==Determining the ''M\u0113\u1e37akarta''==\n{{Main|Katapayadi sankhya}}\nA hundred years after Venkatamakhin's time the ''Katapayadi sankhya'' rule came to be applied to the nomenclature of the ''m\u0113\u1e37akarta'' ragas. The ''sankhya'' associates [[Sanskrit]] consonants with digits. The digits corresponding to the first two syllables of the name of a raga, when reversed, give the index of the raga. Thus the scale of a ''m\u0113\u1e37akarta'' raga can be easily derived from its name.\n\nFor example, ''[[Harikambhoji]]'' raga starts with syllables ''Ha'' and ''ri'', which have numbers 8 and 2 associated with them. Reversing them we get 28. Hence Harikambhoji is the 28th M\u0113\u1e37akarta r\u0101ga. See [[Katapayadi sankhya]] for more details and examples.\n\n==''M\u0113\u1e37akarta'' scale==\nEach ''m\u0113\u1e37akarta'' raga has a different [[scale (music)|scale]]. This scheme envisages the lower Sa (''Keezh Shadja''), upper Sa (''Mael Shadja'') and Pa (''Panchama'') as fixed ''[[swaras]]'', with the Ma (''Madhyama'') having two variants and the remaining swaras Ri (''Rishabha''), Ga (''Gandhaara''), Dha (''Dhaivata'') and Ni (''Nishaada'') as having three variants each. This leads to 72 seven-note combinations (scales) referred to as the ''M\u0113\u1e37akarta'' ragas as follows.\n\nThere are twelve [[semitone]]s of the octave S, R1, R2=G1, R3=G2, G3, M1, M2, P, D1, D2=N1, D3=N2, N3 (see [[swara#Swaras in Carnatic music|''swaras'' in Carnatic music]] for explanation of these notations). A melakarta raga must necessarily have S and P, one of the M's, one each of the R's and G's, and one each of the D's and N's. Also, R must necessarily precede G and D must precede N (''krama samp\u016br\u1e47a'' r\u0101ga). This gives 2 \u00d7 6 \u00d7 6 = 72 ragas. Finding ''m\u0113\u1e37akarta ragas'' is a mathematical process. By following a simple set of rules we can find the corresponding raga and the scale associated with it.\n\nA raga which has a subset of ''svar\u0101s'' from a ''M\u0113\u1e37akarta'' raga is said to be a ''[[janya]]'' (means born or derived from) of that ''M\u0113\u1e37akarta'' raga. Every raga is the ''janya'' of a ''m\u0113\u1e37akarta'' raga. ''Janya'' ragas whose notes are found in more than one ''m\u0113\u1e37akarta'' raga are assigned (or associated) parent ''Melakarta'' based on subjective notions of similarity. This is obvious for ragas that have less than seven notes. For such ragas it can be associated with a ''M\u0113\u1e37akarta'' which has any of the different swaras in that position. For example, [[Hindolam]] has Rishabha and Panchama missing. Hence, it could be considered a janya of ''Todi'' (also known as ''[[Hanumatodi]]'') which has ''shuddha rishabha'' or with ''[[Natabhairavi]]'' which has a ''chathushruti rishabha''. It is popularly associated with ''Natabhairavi''.\n\n==''Chakras''==\n[[Image:Melakarta.katapayadi.sankhya.72.png|250px|thumb|Melakarta chart as per [[Katapay\u0101di system]]. (On the prati-madhyamam side, all instances of ni<sub>2</sub>da<sub>3</sub> should instead say ni<sub>3</sub>da<sub>2</sub>.)]]\nThe 72 ''M\u0113\u1e37akarta'' ragas are split into 12 groups called ''chakr\u0101s'', each containing 6 ragas. The ragas within the chakra differ only in the ''dhaivatam'' and ''nishadam'' notes (D and N), as [[#Table of Melakarta ragas|illustrated below]]. The name of each of the 12 ''chakras'' suggest their ordinal number as well.<ref name=\"ragas\" /><ref name=\"sim\">''South Indian Music'' Book III, by Prof. P Sambamoorthy, Published 1973, The Indian Music Publishing House</ref>\n\n* ''[[Chandra|Indu]]'' stands for the moon, of which we have only one \u2013 hence it is the first ''chakra''.\n* ''N\u0113tra'' means eyes, of which we have two \u2013 hence it is the second.\n* ''[[Agni]]'' is the third ''chakra'' it indicates three kinds of Agni.(Dakshina, Ahavaniyam and gArhapatyam)So agni indicates 3rd ''Chakra''.\n* ''V\u0113da'' denoting four ''[[Vedas]]'' is the name of the fourth ''chakra''.\n* ''B\u0101\u1e47a'' comes fifth as it stands for the five Arrows of ''[[Kamadeva|Manmatha]]''.\n* ''[[Ritu (Indian season)|Rutu]]'' is the sixth ''chakra'' standing for the 6 seasons of Hindu calendar, which are Vasanta, Greeshma, Varsha, Sharat, Hemanta and Shishira.\n* ''[[Rishi]]'', meaning sage, is the seventh ''chakra'' representing the [[Saptarishi|seven sages]].\n* ''[[Vasu]]'' stands for the eight ''vasus'' of Hinduism.\n* ''[[Brahma]]'' comes next of which there are 9.\n* Disi ''Chakra'' indicates Ten directions(East, West, North, South, North East, North West, South East, South West, Above and Below). Hence it is 10th ''Chakra''.\n* Eleventh ''chakra'' is ''[[Rudra]]'' of which there are eleven.\n* Twelfth comes ''[[Aditya#Brahmanas|Aditya]]'' of which there are twelve.\n\nThese 12 ''chakras'' were also established by Venkatamakhi.\n\n==Table of ''Melakarta'' ragas==\nThe 72 ''M\u0113\u1e37akarta'' ragas can be divided into two parts. viz.,. '''suddha Madhyama''' and '''prati Madhyama''' ragas. When a given ''suddha madhyama'' raga's M1 is replaced by M2, we get the corresponding ''prati madhyama'' raga. See [[Katapayadi sankhya]] for more information on how to derive the various ''swaras'' of a raga from its ''melakarta'' number.\n\nSee [[swara#Swaras in Carnatic music|swaras in Carnatic music]] for explanation of the notations like R1, G2, N2, etc.\n{|class=\"wikitable\" width=\"90%\"\n\n!colspan=6 align=\"center\"|<big>''''{{IAST|M\u0113\u1e37akart\u0101 R\u0101gas}}''''</big>\n|-\n!colspan=3 align=\"center\"|''''Shuddha Madhyama''''!!colspan=3 align=\"center\"|''''Prati Madhyama''''\n|-\n!No.!!Raga!!Scale!!No.!!Raga!!Scale\n|-\n!colspan=3 align=\"center\"|1.''Indu Chakra''!!colspan=3 align=\"center\"|7.

''M\u0113\u1e37akarta'' ragas are parent ragas (hence known as ''janaka'' ragas) from which other ragas may be generated. A ''melakarta'' raga is sometimes referred as ''mela'', ''karta'' or ''sampurna'' as well, though the latter term is inaccurate, as a ''sampurna'' raga need not be a ''melakarta'' (take the raga ''Bhairavi,'' for example).\n\nIn [[Hindustani music]] the ''[[thaat]]'' is equivalent of ''Melakarta''. There are 10 ''thaats'' in Hindustani music, though the commonly accepted ''melakarta'' scheme has 72 ragas.\n\n==Rules for ''M\u0113\u1e37akarta''==\nRagas must contain the following characteristics to be considered ''Melakarta''.\n*They are ''[[sampurna raga]]s'' \u2013 they contain all seven ''[[swara]]s'' (notes) of the octave in both ascending and descending scale<ref name=\"ragas\">''Ragas in Carnatic music'' by Dr. S. Bhagyalekshmy, Pub. 1990, CBH Publications</ref><ref name=\"primer\" />\n*They are ''krama sampurna'' ragas \u2013 that is the sequence is strictly ascending and descending in the scales, without any jumps or zig-zag notes<ref name=\"primer\">''A practical course in Carnatic music'' by Prof. P. Sambamurthy, 15th edition published 1998, The Indian Music publishing house</ref>\n*The upper shadjam is included in the raga scale<ref name=\"primer\" /> (ragas like ''Punnagavarali'' and ''Chenchurutti'' are not ''m\u0113\u1e37akarta'' as they end with ''nishadam'')\n*The ascending and descending scales must have the same notes<ref name=\"primer\" />\n\n==History==\nThe ''m\u0113\u1e37a'' system of ragas was first propounded by Raamamaatya in his work [[Svaramelakalanidhi]] c. 1550. He is considered the father of ''mela'' system of ragas. Later, [[Venkatamakhin]], a gifted musicologist in the 17th century, expounded a new ''mela'' system known today as ''m\u0113\u1e37akarta'' in his work ''Chaturdandi Prakaasikaa''.<ref name=\"dikshitar\">Shree Muthuswami Dikshitar Keertanaigal, by A Sundaram Iyer, Madras Book Publications, Mylapore, Chennai</ref> He made some bold and controversial claims and defined somewhat arbitrarily 6 ''svaras'' from the known 12 semitones, at that time, to arrive at 72 ''m\u0113\u1e37akarta'' ragas. The controversial parts relate to double counting of R2 (and similar ''svaras'') and his exclusive selection of ''madyamas'' for which there is no specific reasoning (also known as ''asampurna melas'' as opposed to ''[[sampurna raga]]s'').  However, today the 72 ''m\u0113\u1e37akarta'' ragas use a standardized pattern, unlike Venkatamakhi's pattern, and have gained a significant following. Govindhacharya is credited with the standardization of rules and known for giving different names for standard ragas that have a different structure but the same swaras as those proposed by Venkatamakhi.<ref name=\"dikshitar\" /> The scales in this page are those proposed by Govindaacharya.\n\n==Determining the ''M\u0113\u1e37akarta''==\n{{Main|Katapayadi sankhya}}\nA hundred years after Venkatamakhin's time the ''Katapayadi sankhya'' rule came to be applied to the nomenclature of the ''m\u0113\u1e37akarta'' ragas. The ''sankhya'' associates [[Sanskrit]] consonants with digits. The digits corresponding to the first two syllables of the name of a raga, when reversed, give the index of the raga. Thus the scale of a ''m\u0113\u1e37akarta'' raga can be easily derived from its name.\n\nFor example, ''[[Harikambhoji]]'' raga starts with syllables ''Ha'' and ''ri'', which have numbers 8 and 2 associated with them. Reversing them we get 28. Hence Harikambhoji is the 28th M\u0113\u1e37akarta r\u0101ga. See [[Katapayadi sankhya]] for more details and examples.\n\n==''M\u0113\u1e37akarta'' scale==\nEach ''m\u0113\u1e37akarta'' raga has a different [[scale (music)|scale]]. This scheme envisages the lower Sa (''Keezh Shadja''), upper Sa (''Mael Shadja'') and Pa (''Panchama'') as fixed ''[[swaras]]'', with the Ma (''Madhyama'') having two variants and the remaining swaras Ri (''Rishabha''), Ga (''Gandhaara''), Dha (''Dhaivata'') and Ni (''Nishaada'') as having three variants each. This leads to 72 seven-note combinations (scales) referred to as the ''M\u0113\u1e37akarta'' ragas as follows.\n\nThere are twelve [[semitone]]s of the octave S, R1, R2=G1, R3=G2, G3, M1, M2, P, D1, D2=N1, D3=N2, N3 (see [[swara#Swaras in Carnatic music|''swaras'' in Carnatic music]] for explanation of these notations). A melakarta raga must necessarily have S and P, one of the M's, one each of the R's and G's, and one each of the D's and N's. Also, R must necessarily precede G and D must precede N (''krama samp\u016br\u1e47a'' r\u0101ga). This gives 2 \u00d7 6 \u00d7 6 = 72 ragas. Finding ''m\u0113\u1e37akarta ragas'' is a mathematical process. By following a simple set of rules we can find the corresponding raga and the scale associated with it.\n\nA raga which has a subset of ''svar\u0101s'' from a ''M\u0113\u1e37akarta'' raga is said to be a ''[[janya]]'' (means born or derived from) of that ''M\u0113\u1e37akarta'' raga. Every raga is the ''janya'' of a ''m\u0113\u1e37akarta'' raga. ''Janya'' ragas whose notes are found in more than one ''m\u0113\u1e37akarta'' raga are assigned (or associated) parent ''Melakarta'' based on subjective notions of similarity. This is obvious for ragas that have less than seven notes. For such ragas it can be associated with a ''M\u0113\u1e37akarta'' which has any of the different swaras in that position. For example, [[Hindolam]] has Rishabha and Panchama missing. Hence, it could be considered a janya of ''Todi'' (also known as ''[[Hanumatodi]]'') which has ''shuddha rishabha'' or with ''[[Natabhairavi]]'' which has a ''chathushruti rishabha''. It is popularly associated with ''Natabhairavi''.\n\n==''Chakras''==\n[[Image:Melakarta.katapayadi.sankhya.72.png|250px|thumb|Melakarta chart as per [[Katapay\u0101di system]]. (On the prati-madhyamam side, all instances of ni<sub>2</sub>da<sub>3</sub> should instead say ni<sub>3</sub>da<sub>2</sub>.)]]\nThe 72 ''M\u0113\u1e37akarta'' ragas are split into 12 groups called ''chakr\u0101s'', each containing 6 ragas. The ragas within the chakra differ only in the ''dhaivatam'' and ''nishadam'' notes (D and N), as [[#Table of Melakarta ragas|illustrated below]]. The name of each of the 12 ''chakras'' suggest their ordinal number as well.<ref name=\"ragas\" /><ref name=\"sim\">''South Indian Music'' Book III, by Prof. P Sambamoorthy, Published 1973, The Indian Music Publishing House</ref>\n\n* ''[[Chandra|Indu]]'' stands for the moon, of which we have only one \u2013 hence it is the first ''chakra''.\n* ''N\u0113tra'' means eyes, of which we have two \u2013 hence it is the second.\n* ''[[Agni]]'' is the third ''chakra'' it indicates three kinds of Agni.(Dakshina, Ahavaniyam and gArhapatyam)So agni indicates 3rd ''Chakra''.\n* ''V\u0113da'' denoting four ''[[Vedas]]'' is the name of the fourth ''chakra''.\n* ''B\u0101\u1e47a'' comes fifth as it stands for the five Arrows of ''[[Kamadeva|Manmatha]]''.\n* ''[[Ritu (Indian season)|Rutu]]'' is the sixth ''chakra'' standing for the 6 seasons of Hindu calendar, which are Vasanta, Greeshma, Varsha, Sharat, Hemanta and Shishira.\n* ''[[Rishi]]'', meaning sage, is the seventh ''chakra'' representing the [[Saptarishi|seven sages]].\n* ''[[Vasu]]'' stands for the eight ''vasus'' of Hinduism.\n* ''[[Brahma]]'' comes next of which there are 9.\n* Disi ''Chakra'' indicates Ten directions(East, West, North, South, North East, North West, South East, South West, Above and Below). Hence it is 10th ''Chakra''.\n* Eleventh ''chakra'' is ''[[Rudra]]'' of which there are eleven.\n* Twelfth comes ''[[Aditya#Brahmanas|Aditya]]'' of which there are twelve.\n\nThese 12 ''chakras'' were also established by Venkatamakhi.\n\n==Table of ''Melakarta'' ragas==\nThe 72 ''M\u0113\u1e37akarta'' ragas can be divided into two parts. viz.,. '''suddha Madhyama''' and '''prati Madhyama''' ragas. When a given ''suddha madhyama'' raga's M1 is replaced by M2, we get the corresponding ''prati madhyama'' raga. See [[Katapayadi sankhya]] for more information on how to derive the various ''swaras'' of a raga from its ''melakarta'' number.\n\nSee [[swara#Swaras in Carnatic music|swaras in Carnatic music]] for explanation of the notations like R1, G2, N2, etc.\n{|class=\"wikitable\" width=\"90%\"\n\n!colspan=6 align=\"center\"|<big>''''{{IAST|M\u0113\u1e37akart\u0101 R\u0101gas}}''''</big>\n|-\n!colspan=3 align=\"center\"|''''Shuddha Madhyama''''!!colspan=3 align=\"center\"|''''Prati Madhyama''''\n|-\n!No.!!Raga!!Scale!!No.!!Raga!!Scale\n|-\n!colspan=3 align=\"center\"|1.''Indu Chakra''!!colspan=3 align=\"center\"|7.

It is administered by [[Suffolk City Public Schools]]. The school colors are maroon and Vegas gold, and the official mascot is the Bulldog.\n\nKing's Fork was founded in 2003, and was designed by the architectural firm of Ripley Rodriguez Maddox Motley. It was commissioned by Suffolk City Public Schools due to a widespread economic expansion in sprawl in the western Hampton Roads area.\n\nDue to rezoning, students at King's Fork High are drawn from the Northwestern quadrants of the city, including the King's Fork area, Crittenden, and Hobson. Students are also drawn from the southern Nansemond Parkway/Wilroy Road area, and shares Downtown neighborhoods with [[Lakeland High School (Virginia)|Lakeland High School]].\n\n==Building design==\nAccording to Ripley Rodriguez Maddox Motley, \"Each house contains space for assistant principal, guidance counselor, teacher work areas, general classrooms, science labs, and resource spaces in addition to two to three specialized career/technical subjects. A guidance suite was also included near Administration for flexibility in future guidance arrangements. Science labs are designed as generically as possible with only Chemistry having a necessary uniqueness. Each pair of science lecture spaces shares a wet lab and preparation partitions. Specialty subjects such as Agriculture, Work/Family Studies, Health, JROTC, and Liberal Arts that are not suited for location within houses are properly placed according to need and required access. Instructional areas typically share a small computer lab. The small lab requires less building area but offers more computers per classroom when time-sharing is utilized.\"\n\n==Curriculum==\nKing's Fork High School offers an extensive range of courses at core, honors, and Advanced Placement levels, in addition to various dual enrollment classes offered through the Hobbs campus of Paul D. Camp Community College, also located in Suffolk, and through Tidewater Community College. In addition to academic courses, King's Fork High offers a range of agricultural and resource management courses.\n\nDue to the nature of student interests at the school, only certain core subjects are offered at the AP level at King's Fork, and the arts department often has too few students for courses in music theory or other such classes. However, beginning in the 2008\u20132009 school year, King's Fork began offering courses beginning at the freshman level through the IB (International Baccalaureate) program, in addition to its current curriculum.\n\n==Extracurricular activities==\nKing's Fork High has an athletic program; however, due to the school's relative new status, few of the programs have yet to build up to a successful level. The most notable of these are men's and women's varsity basketball teams, which have broken through to the district and regional level. The 2008-2009 men's varsity basketball team won the AAA state championship.\n\nThe first extracurricular program to achieve statewide recognition from King's Fork was the drama program, which won second place at the 2006 AAA VHSL Theater Festival, under the direction of former drama teacher Clyde Berry.\n\nIn 2017, the Bulldogs football team made school history by winning its first ever Southeastern District title. Notable about the victory was the fact that King's Fork upset longtime powerhouse [[Oscar F. Smith High School|Oscar Smith]], and ended Smith's 99-game district win streak - which dated back to 2006 - in a 29\u201323 win.\n\nIn 2020, the Bulldogs men's basketball team won another state championship, sharing the [[Virginia High School League|VHSL]] title with [[Green Run High School|Green Run]] of [[Virginia Beach]]. Both schools were scheduled to play one another in the championship, which was cancelled due to the [[Covid-19]] outbreak. The VHSL cancelled all championship games following the semifinals; the schools slated to play in the championships were subsequently named co-champions.\n\n== Sports ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! colspan=\"2\" |Fall Athletics\n!Boys & Girls Team\n|-\n|Girls\n|Cheerleading, Cross Country, JV & Varsity Field Hockey, Varsity Volleyball\n| rowspan=\"2\" |\n|-\n|Boys\n|Golf, JV Football, Varsity Volleyball, Cross Country\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" |Winter Athletics\n!\n|-\n|Girls\n|Indoor Track, JV & Varsity Basketball\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Swimming\n|-\n|Boys\n|Indoor Track, JV & Varsity Basketball, JV & Varsity Wrestling\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" |Spring Athletics\n!\n|-\n|Girls\n|JV & Varsity Soccer, JV & Varsity Softball, Outdoor Track, Tennis\n| rowspan=\"2\" |\n|-\n|Boys\n|JV & Varsity Baseball, JV & Varsity Soccer, Outdoor Track, Tennis\n|}\n\n== Clubs ==\n{{Colbegin|colwidth=10em}}\n*Art\n*Band \n*Charming Young Ladies \n*Chorus\n*DECA\n*Drama Club\n*FBLA\n*Fellowship of Christian Athletes\n*International Club\n*Kennel Watchdog Club\n*Key Club\n*National Honor Society\n*Robotics\n*Scholastic Bowl\n*Spirit Club\n*Student Council Association\n*Technology Student Association\n*Video Game Club\n*Yearbook\n*Student Council Association{{Colend}}\n\n==Notable alumni==\n*[[Lex Luger (record producer)|Lex Luger]] - Record Producer\n*[[Sugar Rodgers]] - WNBA guard for the [[New York Liberty]]\n*[[Chuck Clark]] - NFL safety for the [[Baltimore Ravens]]\n*Lataisia Jones - First black recipient of a Doctor of Philosophy degree at the Florida State University College  of Medicine <ref name=\"NotableBulldogs\">{{Cite web|url=https://kfhs.spsk12.net/our_school/notable_bulldogs|title=Notable Bulldogs - King's Fork High School|website=kfhs.spsk12.net|language=en-US|access-date=2018-07-03}}</ref>\n*[[Davante Gardner]] - Professional basketball overseas in Japan for the [[Nishinomiya Storks]] & [[Marquette Golden Eagles]] men's basketball (2010\u20132014) <ref name=\"NotableBulldogs\" />\n*Davon Grayson - Davon Grayson is one of nine receivers who were added to the 2017 [[Fred Biletnikoff Award|Biletnikoff Award]] Watch List...; In 2018 Davon Grayson signed with the [[New York Giants]], becoming the second Bulldog in back to back years to be signed or drafted by an [[National Football League|NFL]] team. <ref name=\"NotableBulldogs\" />\n*Frank Bane - first executive director of the Social Security Board, and former principal of King's Fork High School <ref name=\"NotableBulldogs\" />\n\n==References==\n{{More citations needed|date=August 2014}}\n{{reflist|2}}\n{{Virginia IB}}\n{{AAA Eastern Region}}\n\n{{Coord|36|47|4.3|N|76|35|34.2|W|display=title}}\n\n[[Category:Educational institutions established in 2003]]\n[[Category:International Baccalaureate schools in Virginia]]\n[[Category:Public high schools in Virginia]]\n[[Category:Schools in Suffolk, Virginia]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox School\n|name=          King's Fork High School\n|image=         Kings Fork High in Suffolk.jpg    \n|imagesize=     \n|motto=         \n|streetaddress= 351 Kings Fork Road \n|city=          [[Suffolk, Virginia|Suffolk]]\n|state=         [[Virginia]]\n|zipcode=       23434\n|country=       USA\n|url=           [http://kfhs.spsk12.net/ Official Site]\n|district=      [[Suffolk City Public Schools]]\n|superintendent= Dr. Deran R.

It is administered by [[Suffolk City Public Schools]]. The school colors are maroon and Vegas gold, and the official mascot is the Bulldog.\n\nKing's Fork was founded in 2003, and was designed by the architectural firm of Ripley Rodriguez Maddox Motley. It was commissioned by Suffolk City Public Schools due to a widespread economic expansion in sprawl in the western Hampton Roads area.\n\nDue to rezoning, students at King's Fork High are drawn from the Northwestern quadrants of the city, including the King's Fork area, Crittenden, and Hobson. Students are also drawn from the southern Nansemond Parkway/Wilroy Road area, and shares Downtown neighborhoods with [[Lakeland High School (Virginia)|Lakeland High School]].\n\n==Building design==\nAccording to Ripley Rodriguez Maddox Motley, \"Each house contains space for assistant principal, guidance counselor, teacher work areas, general classrooms, science labs, and resource spaces in addition to two to three specialized career/technical subjects. A guidance suite was also included near Administration for flexibility in future guidance arrangements. Science labs are designed as generically as possible with only Chemistry having a necessary uniqueness. Each pair of science lecture spaces shares a wet lab and preparation partitions. Specialty subjects such as Agriculture, Work/Family Studies, Health, JROTC, and Liberal Arts that are not suited for location within houses are properly placed according to need and required access. Instructional areas typically share a small computer lab. The small lab requires less building area but offers more computers per classroom when time-sharing is utilized.\"\n\n==Curriculum==\nKing's Fork High School offers an extensive range of courses at core, honors, and Advanced Placement levels, in addition to various dual enrollment classes offered through the Hobbs campus of Paul D.

It involves two rounds of division that ultimately result in four cells with only one copy of each [[chromosome]] ([[haploid]]).

Before meiosis begins, during [[S phase]] of the [[cell cycle]], the DNA of each chromosome is replicated so that it consists of two identical [[sister chromatids]], which remain held together through sister chromatid cohesion. This S-phase can be referred to as \"premeiotic S-phase\" or \"meiotic S-phase\".  Immediately following DNA replication, meiotic cells enter a prolonged [[G2 phase|G<sub>2</sub>]]-like stage known as meiotic [[prophase]]. During this time, [[homologous chromosome]]s pair with each other and undergo [[genetic recombination]], a programmed process in which DNA may be cut and then repaired, which allows them to exchange some of their [[genetic information]]. A subset of recombination events results in [[chromosomal crossover|crossovers]], which create physical links known as [[Chiasma (genetics)|chiasmata]] (singular: chiasma, for the Greek letter [[Chi (letter)|Chi (X)]]) between the homologous chromosomes. In most organisms, these links can help direct each pair of homologous chromosomes to [[chromosome segregation|segregate]] away from each other during Meiosis I, resulting in two [[haploid]] cells that have half the number of chromosomes as the parent cell.\n\nDuring meiosis II, the cohesion between sister chromatids is released and they segregate from one another, as during [[mitosis]]. In some cases, all four of the meiotic products form [[gametes]] such as [[sperm]], [[spores]] or [[pollen]]. In female animals, three of the four meiotic products are typically eliminated by [[extrusion]] into [[polar bodies]], and only one cell develops to produce an [[ovum]]. Because the number of chromosomes is halved during meiosis, gametes can fuse (i.e. [[fertilization]]) to form a diploid [[zygote]] that contains two copies of each chromosome, one from each parent. Thus, alternating cycles of meiosis and fertilization enable [[sexual reproduction]], with successive generations maintaining the same number of chromosomes. For example, [[diploid]] human\ncells contain 23 pairs of chromosomes including 1 pair of sex chromosomes (46 total), half of maternal origin and half of paternal origin. Meiosis produces [[haploid]] gametes (ova or sperm) that contain one set of 23 chromosomes. When two gametes (an egg and a sperm) fuse, the resulting zygote is once again diploid, with the mother and father each contributing 23 chromosomes. This same pattern, but not the same number of chromosomes, occurs in all organisms that utilize meiosis.\n\nMeiosis occurs in all sexually-reproducing single-celled and [[Multicellular organism|multicellular]] organisms (which are all [[eukaryote]]s), including [[animal]]s, [[plant]]s and [[fungi]].<ref name=\"Letunic I and Bork P\">{{cite web|url=http://itol.embl.de/|title=Interactive Tree of Life|year=2006|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180129083127/http://itol.embl.de/|archive-date=29 January 2018|access-date=23 July 2011|vauthors=Letunic I, Bork P}}</ref><ref name=\"Bernstein2010\">{{cite journal|vauthors=Bernstein H, Bernstein C|year=2010|title=Evolutionary origin of recombination during meiosis|url=|journal=BioScience|volume=60|issue=7|pages=498\u2013505|doi=10.1525/bio.2010.60.7.5}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|vauthors=Lod\u00e9 T|date=June 2011|title=Sex is not a solution for reproduction: the libertine bubble theory|journal=BioEssays|volume=33|issue=6|pages=419\u201322|doi=10.1002/bies.201000125|pmid=21472739}}</ref> It is an essential process for [[oogenesis]] and [[spermatogenesis]].\n\n==Overview==\nAlthough the process of meiosis is related to the more general cell division process of [[mitosis]], it differs in two important respects:\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto\"\n|+align=bottom style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n|-\n! rowspan=2 style=\"background: #DDEEFF;\" | recombination\n| meiosis\n| align=\"center\" |  [[Genetic recombination|shuffles]] the genes between the two chromosomes in each pair (one received from each parent), producing recombinant chromosomes with unique genetic combinations in every gamete \n|-\n| mitosis\n| align=\"center\" | occurs only if needed to repair DNA damage; \nusually occurs between identical sister chromatids and does not result in genetic changes\n|- bgcolor=#ccccff\n! colspan=3  style=\"background:#dddddd;\" |  &nbsp;\n|-\n! rowspan=2 style=\"background: #DDEEFF;\" | chromosome number (ploidy)\n| meiosis\n| align=\"center\" | produces four genetically unique cells, each with [[haploid|half]] the number of chromosomes as in the parent\n|-\n| mitosis\n| align=\"center\" |produces two genetically identical cells, each with [[Ploidy#Diploid|the same number]] of chromosomes as in the parent\n|-\n|colspan=12 style=\"background: #FFFFFF; border-right:1px solid white; border-bottom:1px solid white; border-left:1px solid white;\"|\n|}\n\nMeiosis begins with a diploid cell, which contains two copies of each chromosome, termed [[homologs]]. First, the cell undergoes [[DNA replication]], so each homolog now consists of two identical sister chromatids. Then each set of homologs pair with each other and exchange genetic information by [[homologous recombination]] often leading to physical connections (crossovers) between the homologs. In the first meiotic division, the homologs are segregated to separate daughter cells by the [[spindle apparatus]]. The cells then proceed to a second division without an intervening round of DNA replication. The sister chromatids are segregated to separate daughter cells to produce a total of four haploid cells. Female animals employ a slight variation on this pattern and produce one large ovum and two small polar bodies. Because of recombination, an individual chromatid can consist of a new combination of maternal and paternal genetic information, resulting in offspring that are genetically distinct from either parent. Furthermore, an individual gamete can include an assortment of maternal, paternal, and recombinant chromatids. This genetic diversity resulting from sexual reproduction contributes to the variation in traits upon which [[natural selection]] can act.\n\nMeiosis uses many of the same mechanisms as [[mitosis]], the type of cell division used by [[eukaryote]]s to divide one cell into two identical daughter cells. In some plants, fungi, and [[protist]]s meiosis results in the formation of [[spore]]s: haploid cells that can divide vegetatively without undergoing fertilization. Some eukaryotes, like [[bdelloid rotifers]], do not have the ability to carry out meiosis and have acquired the ability to reproduce by [[parthenogenesis]].\n\nMeiosis does not occur in [[archaea]] or [[bacteria]], which generally reproduce asexually via [[binary fission]].  However, a \"sexual\" process known as [[horizontal gene transfer]] involves the transfer of DNA from one bacterium or [[archaea|archaeon]] to another and recombination of these DNA molecules of different parental origin.\n\n==History==\nMeiosis was discovered and described for the first time in [[sea urchin]] [[egg (biology)|egg]]s in 1876 by the German biologist [[Oscar Hertwig]]. It was described again in 1883, at the level of [[chromosome]]s, by the Belgian zoologist [[Edouard Van Beneden]], in ''[[Ascaris]]'' roundworm eggs. The significance of meiosis for reproduction and inheritance, however, was described only in 1890 by German biologist [[August Weismann]], who noted that two cell divisions were necessary to transform one diploid cell into four haploid cells if the number of chromosomes had to be maintained.  In 1911, the [[United States|American]] geneticist [[Thomas Hunt Morgan]] detected crossovers in meiosis in the fruit fly ''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]'', which helped to establish that genetic traits are transmitted on chromosomes.\n\nThe term \"meiosis\" (originally spelled \"maiosis\") is derived from the Greek word {{lang|grc|\u03bc\u03b5\u03af\u03c9\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2}}, meaning 'lessening'. It was introduced to biology by [[John Bretland Farmer|J.B. Farmer]] and [[John Edmund Sharrock Moore|J.E.S. Moore]] in 1905:\n<blockquote>''We propose to apply the terms Maiosis or Maiotic phase to cover the whole series of nuclear changes included in the two divisions that were designated as Heterotype and Homotype by [[Walther Flemming|Flemming]]''.<ref>J.B. Farmer and J.E.S. Moore, ''Quarterly Journal of Microscopic Science'' '''48''':489 (1905) as quoted in the [[Oxford English Dictionary]], Third Edition, June 2001, [http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/115952 ''s.v.'']</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe term was linguistically corrected to \"meiosis\" by Koernicke (1905) and by Pantel and De Sinety (1906).<ref>Battaglia E. (1985). Meiosis and mitosis: a terminological criticism. ''Ann Bot'' (Rome) 43: 101\u2013140. [https://books.google.com/books?lr=&hl=en&id=gantAAAAMAAJ link].</ref>\n\n==Phases==\n\nMeiosis is divided into meiosis I and meiosis II which are further divided into Karyokinesis I and Cytokinesis I and Karyokinesis II and Cytokinesis II respectively. The preparatory steps that lead up to meiosis are identical in pattern and name to interphase of the mitotic cell cycle.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121027084115/http://biology.clc.uc.edu/courses/bio104/mitosis.htm|title=Mitosis|date=2012-10-27|access-date=2018-02-09}}</ref> [[Interphase]] is divided into three phases:\n*[[G1 phase|Growth 1 (G<sub>1</sub>) phase]]: In this very active phase, the cell synthesizes its vast array of proteins, including the enzymes and structural proteins it will need for growth. In G<sub>1</sub>, each of the chromosomes consists of a single linear molecule of DNA. \n*[[S phase|Synthesis (S) phase]]: The genetic material is replicated; each of the cell's chromosomes duplicates to become two identical [[sister chromatid]]s attached at a centromere. This replication does not change the [[ploidy]] of the cell since the centromere number remains the same. The identical sister chromatids have not yet condensed into the densely packaged chromosomes visible with the light microscope. This will take place during prophase I in meiosis.\n*[[G2 phase|Growth 2 (G<sub>2</sub>) phase]]: G<sub>2</sub> phase as seen before mitosis is not present in meiosis. Meiotic prophase corresponds most closely to the G<sub>2</sub> phase of the mitotic cell cycle.\n\nInterphase is followed by meiosis I and then meiosis II. Meiosis I separates replicated homologous chromosomes, each still made up of two sister chromatids, into two daughter cells, thus reducing the chromosome number by half. During meiosis II, sister chromatids decouple and the resultant daughter chromosomes are segregated into four daughter cells. For diploid organisms, the daughter cells resulting from meiosis are haploid and contain only one copy of each chromosome. In some species, cells enter a resting phase known as [[interkinesis]] between meiosis I and meiosis II.\n\nMeiosis I and II are each divided into [[prophase]], [[metaphase]], [[anaphase]], and [[telophase]] stages, similar in purpose to their analogous subphases in the mitotic cell cycle. Therefore, meiosis includes the stages of meiosis I (prophase I, metaphase I, anaphase I, telophase I) and meiosis II (prophase II, metaphase II, anaphase II, telophase II).\n\nMeiosis generates gamete genetic diversity in two ways: (1) [[Law of Independent Assortment]]. The independent orientation of homologous chromosome pairs along the metaphase plate during metaphase I and orientation of sister chromatids in metaphase II, this is the subsequent separation of homologs and sister chromatids during anaphase I and II, it allows a random and independent distribution of chromosomes to each daughter cell (and ultimately to gametes);<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Monaghan F, Corcos A | title = On the origins of the Mendelian laws | journal = The Journal of Heredity | volume = 75 | issue = 1 | pages = 67\u20139 | date = 1984-01-01 | pmid = 6368675 | doi = 10.1093/oxfordjournals.jhered.a109868 }}</ref> and (2) [[Crossing over, genetic|Crossing Over]].

Because the ploidy is reduced from diploid to haploid, meiosis I is referred to as a ''reductional division''. Meiosis II is an ''equational division'' analogous to mitosis, in which the sister chromatids are segregated, creating four haploid daughter cells (1n, 1c).<ref>{{Harvnb|Freeman|2005|pp=244\u201345}}</ref>\n[[File:Meiosis Prophase I.png|thumb|Meiosis Prophase I in mice. L:Leptotene, Z:Zygotene, P:Pachytene, D:Diplotene]]\n\n====Prophase I====\nProphase I is typically the longest phase of meiosis. During prophase I, homologous chromosomes pair and exchange genetic information ([[homologous recombination]]). This often results in chromosomal crossover. This process facilitates pairing between homologous chromosomes and hence accurate segregation of the chromosomes at the first meiosis division. The new combinations of DNA created during crossover are a significant source of [[genetic variation]], and result in new combinations of [[alleles]], which may be beneficial. The paired and replicated chromosomes are called bivalents or tetrads, which have two chromosomes and four [[chromatids]], with one chromosome coming from each parent. The process of pairing the homologous chromosomes is called [[synapsis]]. At this stage, non-sister chromatids may cross-over at points called chiasmata (plural; singular [[chiasma (genetics)|chiasma]]).<ref name=\"Freeman249-502\">{{Harvnb|Freeman|2005|pp=249\u2013250}}</ref> Prophase I has historically been divided into a series of substages which are named according to the appearance of chromosomes.\n\n=====Leptotene=====\nThe first stage of prophase I is the ''leptotene'' stage, also known as ''leptonema'', from Greek words meaning \"thin threads\".<ref name=\"Snustad_2008\">{{cite book | title=Principles of Genetics | vauthors = Snustad DP, Simmons MJ |date=December 2008 | edition=5th | isbn=978-0-470-38825-9 | publisher=Wiley}}</ref>{{rp|27}} In this stage of prophase I, individual chromosomes\u2014each consisting of two sister chromatids\u2014become \"individualized\" to form visible strands within the nucleus.<ref name=\"Snustad_2008\"/>{{rp|27}}<ref name=\"Lewins_Genes_X\">{{cite book | title=Lewin's Genes X | edition=10th | vauthors=Krebs JE, Goldstein ES, Kilpatrick ST | isbn=978-0-7637-6632-0 | publisher=Jones & Barlett Learning | date=November 2009 | url-access=registration | url=https://archive.org/details/lewinsgenesx0000unse }}</ref>{{rp|353}} The two sister chromatids closely associate and are visually indistinguishable from one another. During leptotene, lateral elements of the [[synaptonemal complex]] assemble.

In some organisms, this is called the bouquet stage because of the way the telomeres cluster at one end of the nucleus. At this stage, the synapsis (pairing/coming together) of homologous chromosomes takes place, facilitated by assembly of central element of the [[synaptonemal complex]]. Pairing is brought about in a zipper-like fashion and may start at the centromere (procentric), at the chromosome ends (proterminal), or at any other portion (intermediate). Individuals of a pair are equal in length and in position of the centromere. Thus pairing is highly specific and exact. The paired chromosomes are called bivalent or tetrad chromosomes.\n\n=====Pachytene=====\nThe ''pachytene'' stage ({{IPAc-en|\u02c8|p|\u00e6|k|\u026a|t|i\u02d0|n}} {{Respell|PAK|i|teen}}), also known as ''pachynema'', from Greek words meaning \"thick threads\".<ref name=\"Snustad_2008\"/>{{rp|27}} At this point a tetrad of the chromosomes has formed known as a bivalent. This is the stage when homologous recombination, including chromosomal crossover (crossing over), occurs.  Nonsister chromatids of homologous chromosomes may exchange genetic information over regions of homology. DNA damage induced by [[gamma ray|gamma radiation]] during the [[leptotene stage|leptotene]] to early pachytene stages induces an [[homologous recombination]]al repair (HRR) pathway that employs the key proteins [[DMC1 (gene)|DMC1]] and [[RAD51]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Enguita-Marruedo A, Mart\u00edn-Ruiz M, Garc\u00eda E, Gil-Fern\u00e1ndez A, Parra MT, Viera A, Rufas JS, Page J | date = Jan 2019 | title = Transition from a meiotic to a somatic-like DNA damage response during the pachytene stage in mouse meiosis | journal = PLoS Genet | volume = 15 | issue = 1| page = e1007439 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pgen.1007439 | pmid = 30668564 | pmc = 6358097 }}</ref>  This HRR pathway is replaced at mid-pachytene by the less accurate repair pathway of [[non-homologous end joining]] and an HRR pathway that does not depend on DMC1.

The exchange of information between the non-sister chromatids results in a recombination of information; each chromosome has the complete set of information it had before, and there are no gaps formed as a result of the process. Because the chromosomes cannot be distinguished in the synaptonemal complex, the actual act of crossing over is not perceivable through the microscope, and chiasmata are not visible until the next stage.\n\n=====Diplotene=====\nDuring the ''diplotene'' stage, also known as ''diplonema'', from Greek words meaning \"two threads\",<ref name=\"Snustad_2008\"/>{{rp|30}} the [[synaptonemal complex]] degrades and homologous chromosomes separate from one another a little. The chromosomes themselves uncoil a bit, allowing some [[transcription (genetics)|transcription]] of DNA. However, the homologous chromosomes of each bivalent remain tightly bound at chiasmata, the regions where crossing-over occurred. The chiasmata remain on the chromosomes until they are severed at the transition to anaphase I.\n\nIn human fetal [[oogenesis]], all developing oocytes develop to this stage and are arrested in prophase I before birth.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Thompson & Thompson genetics in medicine|last=1950-|first=Nussbaum, Robert L.|others=McInnes, Roderick R.,, Willard, Huntington F.,, Hamosh, Ada,, Preceded by: Nussbaum, Robert L., 1950-|isbn=978-1437706963|edition=Eighth|location=Philadelphia, PA|pages=19|oclc=908336124|date = 2015-05-21}}</ref> This suspended state is referred to as the [[dictyotene|''dictyotene stage'']] or dictyate.

Sites of crossing over entangle together, effectively overlapping, making chiasmata clearly visible.

These centrosomes, which were duplicated during S-phase, function as [[microtubule]] organizing centers nucleating microtubules, which are essentially cellular ropes and poles. The microtubules invade the nuclear region after the nuclear envelope disintegrates, attaching to the chromosomes at the [[kinetochore]]. The kinetochore functions as a motor, pulling the chromosome along the attached microtubule toward the originating centrosome, like a train on a track. There are four kinetochores on each tetrad, but the pair of kinetochores on each sister chromatid fuses and functions as a unit during meiosis I.<ref name=\"Raven-Johnson-Mason-Losos-Singer\">Raven, Peter H.; Johnson, George B.; Mason, Kenneth A.; Losos, Jonathan & Singer, Susan.

Other microtubules will interact with microtubules from the opposite centrosome: these are called ''nonkinetochore microtubules'' or ''polar microtubules''. A third type of microtubules, the aster microtubules, radiates from the centrosome into the cytoplasm or contacts components of the membrane skeleton.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}\n\n====Metaphase I====\nHomologous pairs move together along the metaphase plate: As ''kinetochore microtubules'' from both centrosomes attach to their respective kinetochores, the paired homologous chromosomes align along an equatorial plane that bisects the spindle, due to continuous counterbalancing forces exerted on the bivalents by the microtubules emanating from the two kinetochores of homologous chromosomes. This attachment is referred to as a bipolar attachment. The physical basis of the [[independent assortment]] of chromosomes is the random orientation of each bivalent along the metaphase plate, with respect to the orientation of the other bivalents along the same equatorial line.<ref name=\"Freeman249-502\"/> The protein complex [[cohesin]] holds sister chromatids together from the time of their replication until anaphase. In mitosis, the force of kinetochore microtubules pulling in opposite directions creates tension. The cell senses this tension and does not progress with anaphase until all the chromosomes are properly bi-oriented. In meiosis, establishing tension ordinarily requires at least one crossover per chromosome pair in addition to cohesin between sister chromatids (see [[Chromosome segregation]]).\n\n====Anaphase I====\nKinetochore microtubules shorten, pulling homologous chromosomes (which each consist of a pair of sister chromatids) to opposite poles. Nonkinetochore microtubules lengthen, pushing the centrosomes farther apart. The cell elongates in preparation for division down the center.<ref name=\"Freeman249-502\"/> Unlike in mitosis, only the cohesin from the chromosome arms is degraded while the cohesin surrounding the centromere remains protected by a protein named Shugoshin (Japanese for \"guardian spirit\"), what prevents the sister chromatids from separating.<ref name=\"Pierce, Benjamin 2009\">Pierce, Benjamin (2009). \u00abChromossomes and Cell Reproduction\u00bb.

FREEMAN AND CO. {{ISBN|9780716779285}} P. 32</ref> This allows the sister chromatids to remain together while homologs are segregated.\n\n====Telophase I====\nThe first meiotic division effectively ends when the chromosomes arrive at the poles. Each daughter cell now has half the number of chromosomes but each chromosome consists of a pair of chromatids. The microtubules that make up the spindle network disappear, and a new nuclear membrane surrounds each haploid set. The chromosomes uncoil back into chromatin. Cytokinesis, the pinching of the cell membrane in animal cells or the formation of the cell wall in plant cells, occurs, completing the creation of two daughter cells. Sister chromatids remain attached during telophase I.\n\nCells may enter a period of rest known as [[interkinesis]] or interphase II. No DNA replication occurs during this stage.\n\n===Meiosis II===\nMeiosis II is the second meiotic division, and usually involves equational segregation, or separation of sister chromatids. Mechanically, the process is similar to mitosis, though its genetic results are fundamentally different. The end result is production of four haploid cells (n chromosomes, 23 in humans) from the two haploid cells (with n chromosomes, each consisting of two sister chromatids) produced in meiosis I. The four main steps of meiosis II are: prophase II, metaphase II, anaphase II, and telophase II.\n\nIn '''prophase II''', we see the disappearance of the nucleoli and the [[nuclear envelope]] again as well as the shortening and thickening of the chromatids. Centrosomes move to the polar regions and arrange spindle fibers for the second meiotic division.\n\nIn '''metaphase II''', the centromeres contain two kinetochores that attach to spindle fibers from the centrosomes at opposite poles. The new equatorial metaphase plate is rotated by 90 degrees when compared to meiosis I, perpendicular to the previous plate.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.phschool.com/science/biology_place/biocoach/meiosis/metaii.html |publisher=Pearson |work=The Biology Place |title=BioCoach Activity: Concept 11: Meiosis II: Metaphase II |access-date=2018-02-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180228110158/http://www.phschool.com/science/biology_place/biocoach/meiosis/metaii.html |archive-date=2018-02-28 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nThis is followed by '''anaphase II''', in which the remaining centromeric cohesin, not protected by Shugoshin anymore, is cleaved, allowing the sister chromatids to segregate. The sister chromatids by convention are now called sister chromosomes as they move toward opposing poles.<ref name=\"Pierce, Benjamin 2009\"/>\n\nThe process ends with '''telophase II''', which is similar to telophase I, and is marked by decondensation and lengthening of the chromosomes and the disassembly of the spindle.  Nuclear envelopes re-form and cleavage or cell plate formation eventually produces a total of four daughter cells, each with a haploid set of chromosomes.\n\nMeiosis is now complete and ends up with four new daughter cells.\n\n==Origin and function==\n{{main|Origin and function of meiosis}}\n{{:Origin and function of meiosis}}\n\n==Occurrence==\n===In life cycles===\n[[Image:gametic meiosis.png|thumb|350px|Diplontic life cycle]]\n[[Image:zygotic meiosis.png|thumb|350px|Haplontic life cycle.]]\n\n{{Main|Biological life cycle}}\nMeiosis occurs in eukaryotic [[biological life cycle|life cycles]] involving [[sexual reproduction]], consisting of the constant cyclical process of meiosis and fertilization. This takes place alongside normal [[mitosis|mitotic]] cell division. In multicellular organisms, there is an intermediary step between the diploid and haploid transition where the organism grows. At certain stages of the life cycle, [[germ cell]]s produce gametes. [[Somatic cell]]s make up the body of the organism and are not involved in gamete production.\n\nCycling meiosis and fertilization events produces a series of transitions back and forth between alternating haploid and diploid states. The organism phase of the life cycle can occur either during the diploid state (''diplontic'' life cycle), during the haploid state (''haplontic'' life cycle), or both (''haplodiplontic'' life cycle, in which there are two distinct organism phases, one during the haploid state and the other during the diploid state). In this sense there are three types of life cycles that utilize sexual reproduction, differentiated by the location of the organism phase(s).{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}\n\nIn the ''diplontic life cycle'' (with pre-gametic meiosis), of which humans are a part, the organism is diploid, grown from a diploid cell called the [[zygote]]. The organism's diploid germ-line stem cells undergo meiosis to create haploid gametes (the [[spermatozoa]] for males and [[ovum|ova]] for females), which fertilize to form the zygote. The diploid zygote undergoes repeated cellular division by [[mitosis]] to grow into the organism.\n\nIn the ''haplontic life cycle'' (with post-zygotic meiosis), the organism is haploid instead, spawned by the proliferation and differentiation of a single haploid cell called the [[gamete]]. Two organisms of opposing sex contribute their haploid gametes to form a diploid zygote. The zygote undergoes meiosis immediately, creating four haploid cells. These cells undergo [[mitosis]] to create the organism. Many [[Fungus|fungi]] and many [[protozoa]] utilize the haplontic life cycle. {{citation needed|date=January 2011}}\n\nFinally, in the ''haplodiplontic life cycle'' (with sporic or intermediate meiosis), the living organism alternates between haploid and diploid states. Consequently, this cycle is also known as the [[alternation of generations]]. The diploid organism's germ-line cells undergo meiosis to produce spores. The spores proliferate by mitosis, growing into a haploid organism. The haploid organism's gamete then combines with another haploid organism's gamete, creating the zygote. The zygote undergoes repeated mitosis and differentiation to become a diploid organism again. The haplodiplontic life cycle can be considered a fusion of the diplontic and haplontic life cycles.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=dOaODP4Oo5kC&pg=PA121&lpg=PA121&dq=The+sporic+life+cycle+can+be+considered+a+fusion+of+the+gametic+and+zygotic+life+cycles#v=onepage&q=The%20sporic%20life%20cycle%20can%20be%20considered%20a%20fusion%20of%20the%20gametic%20and%20zygotic%20life%20cycles&f=false|title=An Introduction to Phycology| vauthors = South GR, Whittick A |date=2009-07-08|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|isbn=9781444314205|language=en}}</ref>{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}\n\n===In plants and animals===\n[[File:MitosisAndMeiosis en.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Overview of chromatides' and chromosomes' distribution within the mitotic and meiotic cycle of a male human cell]]\nMeiosis occurs in all animals and plants. The end result, the production of gametes with half the number of chromosomes as the parent cell, is the same, but the detailed process is different. In animals, meiosis produces gametes directly. In land plants and some algae, there is an [[alternation of generations]] such that meiosis in the diploid [[sporophyte]] generation produces haploid spores. These spores multiply by mitosis, developing into the haploid [[gametophyte]] generation, which then gives rise to gametes directly (i.e. without further meiosis). In both animals and plants, the final stage is for the gametes to fuse, restoring the original number of chromosomes.<ref>{{cite book|last=Bidlack|first=James E.|title=Introductory Plant Biology|year=2011|publisher=McGraw HIll|location=New York, NY|pages=214\u201329}}</ref>\n\n===In mammals===\nIn females, meiosis occurs in cells known as [[oocyte]]s (singular: oocyte). Each primary oocyte divides twice in meiosis, unequally in each case. The first division produces a daughter cell, and a much smaller polar body which may or may not undergo a second division. In meiosis II, division of the daughter cell produces a second polar body, and a single haploid cell, which enlarges to become an [[egg cell|ovum]]. Therefore, in females each primary oocyte that undergoes meiosis results in one mature ovum and one or two polar bodies.\n\nNote that there are pauses during meiosis in females. Maturing oocytes are arrested in prophase I of meiosis I and lie dormant within a protective shell of somatic cells called the [[ovarian follicle|follicle]]. At the beginning of each [[menstrual cycle]], [[follicle-stimulating hormone|FSH]] secretion from the anterior pituitary stimulates a few follicles to mature in a process known as [[folliculogenesis]]. During this process, the maturing oocytes resume meiosis and continue until metaphase II of meiosis II, where they are again arrested just before ovulation. If these oocytes are fertilized by sperm, they will resume and complete meiosis. During folliculogenesis in humans, usually one follicle becomes dominant while the others undergo [[Follicular atresia|atresia]]. The process of meiosis in females occurs during [[oogenesis]], and differs from the typical meiosis in that it features a long period of meiotic arrest known as the [[dictyate]] stage and lacks the assistance of [[centrosome]]s.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Brunet S, Verlhac MH | title = Positioning to get out of meiosis: the asymmetry of division | journal = Human Reproduction Update | volume = 17 | issue = 1 | pages = 68\u201375 | year = 2010 | pmid = 20833637 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1093/humupd/dmq044 | url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/e8c07fec6ce4306cfacbb52bcb8335383e60a58e }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Rosenbusch B | title = The contradictory information on the distribution of non-disjunction and pre-division in female gametes | journal = Human Reproduction | volume = 21 | issue = 11 | pages = 2739\u201342 | date = November 2006 | pmid = 16982661 | doi = 10.1093/humrep/del122 }}</ref>\n\nIn males, meiosis occurs during [[spermatogenesis]] in the [[seminiferous tubule]]s of the [[testicle]]s.

Meiosis of primordial germ cells happens at the time of puberty, much later than in females.

When the segregation is not normal, it is called ''nondisjunction''.  This results in the production of gametes which have either too many or too few of a particular chromosome, and is a common mechanism for [[trisomy]] or [[monosomy]].  Nondisjunction can occur in the meiosis I or meiosis II, phases of cellular reproduction, or during [[mitosis]].\n\nMost monosomic and trisomic human embryos are not viable, but some aneuploidies can be tolerated, such as trisomy for the smallest chromosome, chromosome 21. Phenotypes of these aneuploidies range from severe developmental disorders to asymptomatic.

Before meiosis begins, during [[S phase]] of the [[cell cycle]], the DNA of each chromosome is replicated so that it consists of two identical [[sister chromatids]], which remain held together through sister chromatid cohesion. This S-phase can be referred to as \"premeiotic S-phase\" or \"meiotic S-phase\".  Immediately following DNA replication, meiotic cells enter a prolonged [[G2 phase|G<sub>2</sub>]]-like stage known as meiotic [[prophase]]. During this time, [[homologous chromosome]]s pair with each other and undergo [[genetic recombination]], a programmed process in which DNA may be cut and then repaired, which allows them to exchange some of their [[genetic information]]. A subset of recombination events results in [[chromosomal crossover|crossovers]], which create physical links known as [[Chiasma (genetics)|chiasmata]] (singular: chiasma, for the Greek letter [[Chi (letter)|Chi (X)]]) between the homologous chromosomes. In most organisms, these links can help direct each pair of homologous chromosomes to [[chromosome segregation|segregate]] away from each other during Meiosis I, resulting in two [[haploid]] cells that have half the number of chromosomes as the parent cell.\n\nDuring meiosis II, the cohesion between sister chromatids is released and they segregate from one another, as during [[mitosis]]. In some cases, all four of the meiotic products form [[gametes]] such as [[sperm]], [[spores]] or [[pollen]]. In female animals, three of the four meiotic products are typically eliminated by [[extrusion]] into [[polar bodies]], and only one cell develops to produce an [[ovum]]. Because the number of chromosomes is halved during meiosis, gametes can fuse (i.e. [[fertilization]]) to form a diploid [[zygote]] that contains two copies of each chromosome, one from each parent. Thus, alternating cycles of meiosis and fertilization enable [[sexual reproduction]], with successive generations maintaining the same number of chromosomes. For example, [[diploid]] human\ncells contain 23 pairs of chromosomes including 1 pair of sex chromosomes (46 total), half of maternal origin and half of paternal origin. Meiosis produces [[haploid]] gametes (ova or sperm) that contain one set of 23 chromosomes. When two gametes (an egg and a sperm) fuse, the resulting zygote is once again diploid, with the mother and father each contributing 23 chromosomes. This same pattern, but not the same number of chromosomes, occurs in all organisms that utilize meiosis.\n\nMeiosis occurs in all sexually-reproducing single-celled and [[Multicellular organism|multicellular]] organisms (which are all [[eukaryote]]s), including [[animal]]s, [[plant]]s and [[fungi]].<ref name=\"Letunic I and Bork P\">{{cite web|url=http://itol.embl.de/|title=Interactive Tree of Life|year=2006|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180129083127/http://itol.embl.de/|archive-date=29 January 2018|access-date=23 July 2011|vauthors=Letunic I, Bork P}}</ref><ref name=\"Bernstein2010\">{{cite journal|vauthors=Bernstein H, Bernstein C|year=2010|title=Evolutionary origin of recombination during meiosis|url=|journal=BioScience|volume=60|issue=7|pages=498\u2013505|doi=10.1525/bio.2010.60.7.5}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|vauthors=Lod\u00e9 T|date=June 2011|title=Sex is not a solution for reproduction: the libertine bubble theory|journal=BioEssays|volume=33|issue=6|pages=419\u201322|doi=10.1002/bies.201000125|pmid=21472739}}</ref> It is an essential process for [[oogenesis]] and [[spermatogenesis]].\n\n==Overview==\nAlthough the process of meiosis is related to the more general cell division process of [[mitosis]], it differs in two important respects:\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto\"\n|+align=bottom style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n|-\n! rowspan=2 style=\"background: #DDEEFF;\" | recombination\n| meiosis\n| align=\"center\" |  [[Genetic recombination|shuffles]] the genes between the two chromosomes in each pair (one received from each parent), producing recombinant chromosomes with unique genetic combinations in every gamete \n|-\n| mitosis\n| align=\"center\" | occurs only if needed to repair DNA damage; \nusually occurs between identical sister chromatids and does not result in genetic changes\n|- bgcolor=#ccccff\n! colspan=3  style=\"background:#dddddd;\" |  &nbsp;\n|-\n! rowspan=2 style=\"background: #DDEEFF;\" | chromosome number (ploidy)\n| meiosis\n| align=\"center\" | produces four genetically unique cells, each with [[haploid|half]] the number of chromosomes as in the parent\n|-\n| mitosis\n| align=\"center\" |produces two genetically identical cells, each with [[Ploidy#Diploid|the same number]] of chromosomes as in the parent\n|-\n|colspan=12 style=\"background: #FFFFFF; border-right:1px solid white; border-bottom:1px solid white; border-left:1px solid white;\"|\n|}\n\nMeiosis begins with a diploid cell, which contains two copies of each chromosome, termed [[homologs]]. First, the cell undergoes [[DNA replication]], so each homolog now consists of two identical sister chromatids. Then each set of homologs pair with each other and exchange genetic information by [[homologous recombination]] often leading to physical connections (crossovers) between the homologs. In the first meiotic division, the homologs are segregated to separate daughter cells by the [[spindle apparatus]]. The cells then proceed to a second division without an intervening round of DNA replication. The sister chromatids are segregated to separate daughter cells to produce a total of four haploid cells. Female animals employ a slight variation on this pattern and produce one large ovum and two small polar bodies. Because of recombination, an individual chromatid can consist of a new combination of maternal and paternal genetic information, resulting in offspring that are genetically distinct from either parent. Furthermore, an individual gamete can include an assortment of maternal, paternal, and recombinant chromatids. This genetic diversity resulting from sexual reproduction contributes to the variation in traits upon which [[natural selection]] can act.\n\nMeiosis uses many of the same mechanisms as [[mitosis]], the type of cell division used by [[eukaryote]]s to divide one cell into two identical daughter cells. In some plants, fungi, and [[protist]]s meiosis results in the formation of [[spore]]s: haploid cells that can divide vegetatively without undergoing fertilization. Some eukaryotes, like [[bdelloid rotifers]], do not have the ability to carry out meiosis and have acquired the ability to reproduce by [[parthenogenesis]].\n\nMeiosis does not occur in [[archaea]] or [[bacteria]], which generally reproduce asexually via [[binary fission]].  However, a \"sexual\" process known as [[horizontal gene transfer]] involves the transfer of DNA from one bacterium or [[archaea|archaeon]] to another and recombination of these DNA molecules of different parental origin.\n\n==History==\nMeiosis was discovered and described for the first time in [[sea urchin]] [[egg (biology)|egg]]s in 1876 by the German biologist [[Oscar Hertwig]]. It was described again in 1883, at the level of [[chromosome]]s, by the Belgian zoologist [[Edouard Van Beneden]], in ''[[Ascaris]]'' roundworm eggs. The significance of meiosis for reproduction and inheritance, however, was described only in 1890 by German biologist [[August Weismann]], who noted that two cell divisions were necessary to transform one diploid cell into four haploid cells if the number of chromosomes had to be maintained.  In 1911, the [[United States|American]] geneticist [[Thomas Hunt Morgan]] detected crossovers in meiosis in the fruit fly ''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]'', which helped to establish that genetic traits are transmitted on chromosomes.\n\nThe term \"meiosis\" (originally spelled \"maiosis\") is derived from the Greek word {{lang|grc|\u03bc\u03b5\u03af\u03c9\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2}}, meaning 'lessening'. It was introduced to biology by [[John Bretland Farmer|J.B. Farmer]] and [[John Edmund Sharrock Moore|J.E.S. Moore]] in 1905:\n<blockquote>''We propose to apply the terms Maiosis or Maiotic phase to cover the whole series of nuclear changes included in the two divisions that were designated as Heterotype and Homotype by [[Walther Flemming|Flemming]]''.<ref>J.B. Farmer and J.E.S. Moore, ''Quarterly Journal of Microscopic Science'' '''48''':489 (1905) as quoted in the [[Oxford English Dictionary]], Third Edition, June 2001, [http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/115952 ''s.v.'']</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe term was linguistically corrected to \"meiosis\" by Koernicke (1905) and by Pantel and De Sinety (1906).<ref>Battaglia E. (1985). Meiosis and mitosis: a terminological criticism. ''Ann Bot'' (Rome) 43: 101\u2013140.

The preparatory steps that lead up to meiosis are identical in pattern and name to interphase of the mitotic cell cycle.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121027084115/http://biology.clc.uc.edu/courses/bio104/mitosis.htm|title=Mitosis|date=2012-10-27|access-date=2018-02-09}}</ref> [[Interphase]] is divided into three phases:\n*[[G1 phase|Growth 1 (G<sub>1</sub>) phase]]: In this very active phase, the cell synthesizes its vast array of proteins, including the enzymes and structural proteins it will need for growth. In G<sub>1</sub>, each of the chromosomes consists of a single linear molecule of DNA. \n*[[S phase|Synthesis (S) phase]]: The genetic material is replicated; each of the cell's chromosomes duplicates to become two identical [[sister chromatid]]s attached at a centromere. This replication does not change the [[ploidy]] of the cell since the centromere number remains the same. The identical sister chromatids have not yet condensed into the densely packaged chromosomes visible with the light microscope. This will take place during prophase I in meiosis.\n*[[G2 phase|Growth 2 (G<sub>2</sub>) phase]]: G<sub>2</sub> phase as seen before mitosis is not present in meiosis. Meiotic prophase corresponds most closely to the G<sub>2</sub> phase of the mitotic cell cycle.\n\nInterphase is followed by meiosis I and then meiosis II. Meiosis I separates replicated homologous chromosomes, each still made up of two sister chromatids, into two daughter cells, thus reducing the chromosome number by half. During meiosis II, sister chromatids decouple and the resultant daughter chromosomes are segregated into four daughter cells. For diploid organisms, the daughter cells resulting from meiosis are haploid and contain only one copy of each chromosome. In some species, cells enter a resting phase known as [[interkinesis]] between meiosis I and meiosis II.\n\nMeiosis I and II are each divided into [[prophase]], [[metaphase]], [[anaphase]], and [[telophase]] stages, similar in purpose to their analogous subphases in the mitotic cell cycle. Therefore, meiosis includes the stages of meiosis I (prophase I, metaphase I, anaphase I, telophase I) and meiosis II (prophase II, metaphase II, anaphase II, telophase II).\n\nMeiosis generates gamete genetic diversity in two ways: (1) [[Law of Independent Assortment]]. The independent orientation of homologous chromosome pairs along the metaphase plate during metaphase I and orientation of sister chromatids in metaphase II, this is the subsequent separation of homologs and sister chromatids during anaphase I and II, it allows a random and independent distribution of chromosomes to each daughter cell (and ultimately to gametes);<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Monaghan F, Corcos A | title = On the origins of the Mendelian laws | journal = The Journal of Heredity | volume = 75 | issue = 1 | pages = 67\u20139 | date = 1984-01-01 | pmid = 6368675 | doi = 10.1093/oxfordjournals.jhered.a109868 }}</ref> and (2) [[Crossing over, genetic|Crossing Over]].

During prophase I, homologous chromosomes pair and exchange genetic information ([[homologous recombination]]). This often results in chromosomal crossover. This process facilitates pairing between homologous chromosomes and hence accurate segregation of the chromosomes at the first meiosis division. The new combinations of DNA created during crossover are a significant source of [[genetic variation]], and result in new combinations of [[alleles]], which may be beneficial. The paired and replicated chromosomes are called bivalents or tetrads, which have two chromosomes and four [[chromatids]], with one chromosome coming from each parent. The process of pairing the homologous chromosomes is called [[synapsis]]. At this stage, non-sister chromatids may cross-over at points called chiasmata (plural; singular [[chiasma (genetics)|chiasma]]).<ref name=\"Freeman249-502\">{{Harvnb|Freeman|2005|pp=249\u2013250}}</ref> Prophase I has historically been divided into a series of substages which are named according to the appearance of chromosomes.\n\n=====Leptotene=====\nThe first stage of prophase I is the ''leptotene'' stage, also known as ''leptonema'', from Greek words meaning \"thin threads\".<ref name=\"Snustad_2008\">{{cite book | title=Principles of Genetics | vauthors = Snustad DP, Simmons MJ |date=December 2008 | edition=5th | isbn=978-0-470-38825-9 | publisher=Wiley}}</ref>{{rp|27}} In this stage of prophase I, individual chromosomes\u2014each consisting of two sister chromatids\u2014become \"individualized\" to form visible strands within the nucleus.<ref name=\"Snustad_2008\"/>{{rp|27}}<ref name=\"Lewins_Genes_X\">{{cite book | title=Lewin's Genes X | edition=10th | vauthors=Krebs JE, Goldstein ES, Kilpatrick ST | isbn=978-0-7637-6632-0 | publisher=Jones & Barlett Learning | date=November 2009 | url-access=registration | url=https://archive.org/details/lewinsgenesx0000unse }}</ref>{{rp|353}} The two sister chromatids closely associate and are visually indistinguishable from one another.

In some organisms, this is called the bouquet stage because of the way the telomeres cluster at one end of the nucleus. At this stage, the synapsis (pairing/coming together) of homologous chromosomes takes place, facilitated by assembly of central element of the [[synaptonemal complex]]. Pairing is brought about in a zipper-like fashion and may start at the centromere (procentric), at the chromosome ends (proterminal), or at any other portion (intermediate). Individuals of a pair are equal in length and in position of the centromere. Thus pairing is highly specific and exact. The paired chromosomes are called bivalent or tetrad chromosomes.\n\n=====Pachytene=====\nThe ''pachytene'' stage ({{IPAc-en|\u02c8|p|\u00e6|k|\u026a|t|i\u02d0|n}} {{Respell|PAK|i|teen}}), also known as ''pachynema'', from Greek words meaning \"thick threads\".<ref name=\"Snustad_2008\"/>{{rp|27}} At this point a tetrad of the chromosomes has formed known as a bivalent.

[[Sex chromosomes]], however, are not wholly identical, and only exchange information over a small region of homology. At the sites where exchange happens, [[Chiasma (genetics)|chiasmata]] form. The exchange of information between the non-sister chromatids results in a recombination of information; each chromosome has the complete set of information it had before, and there are no gaps formed as a result of the process. Because the chromosomes cannot be distinguished in the synaptonemal complex, the actual act of crossing over is not perceivable through the microscope, and chiasmata are not visible until the next stage.\n\n=====Diplotene=====\nDuring the ''diplotene'' stage, also known as ''diplonema'', from Greek words meaning \"two threads\",<ref name=\"Snustad_2008\"/>{{rp|30}} the [[synaptonemal complex]] degrades and homologous chromosomes separate from one another a little. The chromosomes themselves uncoil a bit, allowing some [[transcription (genetics)|transcription]] of DNA. However, the homologous chromosomes of each bivalent remain tightly bound at chiasmata, the regions where crossing-over occurred. The chiasmata remain on the chromosomes until they are severed at the transition to anaphase I.\n\nIn human fetal [[oogenesis]], all developing oocytes develop to this stage and are arrested in prophase I before birth.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Thompson & Thompson genetics in medicine|last=1950-|first=Nussbaum, Robert L.|others=McInnes, Roderick R.,, Willard, Huntington F.,, Hamosh, Ada,, Preceded by: Nussbaum, Robert L., 1950-|isbn=978-1437706963|edition=Eighth|location=Philadelphia, PA|pages=19|oclc=908336124|date = 2015-05-21}}</ref> This suspended state is referred to as the [[dictyotene|''dictyotene stage'']] or dictyate. It lasts until meiosis is resumed to prepare the oocyte for ovulation, which happens at puberty or even later.\n\n=====Diakinesis=====\nChromosomes condense further during the ''diakinesis'' stage, from Greek words meaning \"moving through\".<ref name=\"Snustad_2008\"/>{{rp|30}} This is the first point in meiosis where the four parts of the tetrads are actually visible. Sites of crossing over entangle together, effectively overlapping, making chiasmata clearly visible. Other than this observation, the rest of the stage closely resembles [[prometaphase]] of mitosis; the [[Nucleolus|nucleoli]] disappear, the [[nuclear membrane]] disintegrates into vesicles, and the [[Spindle apparatus|meiotic spindle]] begins to form.\n\n=====Synchronous processes=====\nDuring these stages, two [[centrosome]]s, containing a pair of [[centriole]]s in animal cells, migrate to the two poles of the cell. These centrosomes, which were duplicated during S-phase, function as [[microtubule]] organizing centers nucleating microtubules, which are essentially cellular ropes and poles. The microtubules invade the nuclear region after the nuclear envelope disintegrates, attaching to the chromosomes at the [[kinetochore]]. The kinetochore functions as a motor, pulling the chromosome along the attached microtubule toward the originating centrosome, like a train on a track. There are four kinetochores on each tetrad, but the pair of kinetochores on each sister chromatid fuses and functions as a unit during meiosis I.<ref name=\"Raven-Johnson-Mason-Losos-Singer\">Raven, Peter H.; Johnson, George B.; Mason, Kenneth A.; Losos, Jonathan & Singer, Susan.

Other microtubules will interact with microtubules from the opposite centrosome: these are called ''nonkinetochore microtubules'' or ''polar microtubules''. A third type of microtubules, the aster microtubules, radiates from the centrosome into the cytoplasm or contacts components of the membrane skeleton.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}\n\n====Metaphase I====\nHomologous pairs move together along the metaphase plate: As ''kinetochore microtubules'' from both centrosomes attach to their respective kinetochores, the paired homologous chromosomes align along an equatorial plane that bisects the spindle, due to continuous counterbalancing forces exerted on the bivalents by the microtubules emanating from the two kinetochores of homologous chromosomes. This attachment is referred to as a bipolar attachment. The physical basis of the [[independent assortment]] of chromosomes is the random orientation of each bivalent along the metaphase plate, with respect to the orientation of the other bivalents along the same equatorial line.<ref name=\"Freeman249-502\"/> The protein complex [[cohesin]] holds sister chromatids together from the time of their replication until anaphase. In mitosis, the force of kinetochore microtubules pulling in opposite directions creates tension. The cell senses this tension and does not progress with anaphase until all the chromosomes are properly bi-oriented. In meiosis, establishing tension ordinarily requires at least one crossover per chromosome pair in addition to cohesin between sister chromatids (see [[Chromosome segregation]]).\n\n====Anaphase I====\nKinetochore microtubules shorten, pulling homologous chromosomes (which each consist of a pair of sister chromatids) to opposite poles. Nonkinetochore microtubules lengthen, pushing the centrosomes farther apart. The cell elongates in preparation for division down the center.<ref name=\"Freeman249-502\"/> Unlike in mitosis, only the cohesin from the chromosome arms is degraded while the cohesin surrounding the centromere remains protected by a protein named Shugoshin (Japanese for \"guardian spirit\"), what prevents the sister chromatids from separating.<ref name=\"Pierce, Benjamin 2009\">Pierce, Benjamin (2009). \u00abChromossomes and Cell Reproduction\u00bb. Genetics: A Conceptual Approach, Third Edition. W.H. FREEMAN AND CO. {{ISBN|9780716779285}} P. 32</ref> This allows the sister chromatids to remain together while homologs are segregated.\n\n====Telophase I====\nThe first meiotic division effectively ends when the chromosomes arrive at the poles. Each daughter cell now has half the number of chromosomes but each chromosome consists of a pair of chromatids. The microtubules that make up the spindle network disappear, and a new nuclear membrane surrounds each haploid set. The chromosomes uncoil back into chromatin. Cytokinesis, the pinching of the cell membrane in animal cells or the formation of the cell wall in plant cells, occurs, completing the creation of two daughter cells. Sister chromatids remain attached during telophase I.\n\nCells may enter a period of rest known as [[interkinesis]] or interphase II. No DNA replication occurs during this stage.\n\n===Meiosis II===\nMeiosis II is the second meiotic division, and usually involves equational segregation, or separation of sister chromatids. Mechanically, the process is similar to mitosis, though its genetic results are fundamentally different. The end result is production of four haploid cells (n chromosomes, 23 in humans) from the two haploid cells (with n chromosomes, each consisting of two sister chromatids) produced in meiosis I. The four main steps of meiosis II are: prophase II, metaphase II, anaphase II, and telophase II.\n\nIn '''prophase II''', we see the disappearance of the nucleoli and the [[nuclear envelope]] again as well as the shortening and thickening of the chromatids. Centrosomes move to the polar regions and arrange spindle fibers for the second meiotic division.\n\nIn '''metaphase II''', the centromeres contain two kinetochores that attach to spindle fibers from the centrosomes at opposite poles. The new equatorial metaphase plate is rotated by 90 degrees when compared to meiosis I, perpendicular to the previous plate.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.phschool.com/science/biology_place/biocoach/meiosis/metaii.html |publisher=Pearson |work=The Biology Place |title=BioCoach Activity: Concept 11: Meiosis II: Metaphase II |access-date=2018-02-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180228110158/http://www.phschool.com/science/biology_place/biocoach/meiosis/metaii.html |archive-date=2018-02-28 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nThis is followed by '''anaphase II''', in which the remaining centromeric cohesin, not protected by Shugoshin anymore, is cleaved, allowing the sister chromatids to segregate. The sister chromatids by convention are now called sister chromosomes as they move toward opposing poles.<ref name=\"Pierce, Benjamin 2009\"/>\n\nThe process ends with '''telophase II''', which is similar to telophase I, and is marked by decondensation and lengthening of the chromosomes and the disassembly of the spindle.  Nuclear envelopes re-form and cleavage or cell plate formation eventually produces a total of four daughter cells, each with a haploid set of chromosomes.\n\nMeiosis is now complete and ends up with four new daughter cells.\n\n==Origin and function==\n{{main|Origin and function of meiosis}}\n{{:Origin and function of meiosis}}\n\n==Occurrence==\n===In life cycles===\n[[Image:gametic meiosis.png|thumb|350px|Diplontic life cycle]]\n[[Image:zygotic meiosis.png|thumb|350px|Haplontic life cycle.]]\n\n{{Main|Biological life cycle}}\nMeiosis occurs in eukaryotic [[biological life cycle|life cycles]] involving [[sexual reproduction]], consisting of the constant cyclical process of meiosis and fertilization. This takes place alongside normal [[mitosis|mitotic]] cell division. In multicellular organisms, there is an intermediary step between the diploid and haploid transition where the organism grows. At certain stages of the life cycle, [[germ cell]]s produce gametes. [[Somatic cell]]s make up the body of the organism and are not involved in gamete production.\n\nCycling meiosis and fertilization events produces a series of transitions back and forth between alternating haploid and diploid states. The organism phase of the life cycle can occur either during the diploid state (''diplontic'' life cycle), during the haploid state (''haplontic'' life cycle), or both (''haplodiplontic'' life cycle, in which there are two distinct organism phases, one during the haploid state and the other during the diploid state). In this sense there are three types of life cycles that utilize sexual reproduction, differentiated by the location of the organism phase(s).{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}\n\nIn the ''diplontic life cycle'' (with pre-gametic meiosis), of which humans are a part, the organism is diploid, grown from a diploid cell called the [[zygote]]. The organism's diploid germ-line stem cells undergo meiosis to create haploid gametes (the [[spermatozoa]] for males and [[ovum|ova]] for females), which fertilize to form the zygote. The diploid zygote undergoes repeated cellular division by [[mitosis]] to grow into the organism.\n\nIn the ''haplontic life cycle'' (with post-zygotic meiosis), the organism is haploid instead, spawned by the proliferation and differentiation of a single haploid cell called the [[gamete]]. Two organisms of opposing sex contribute their haploid gametes to form a diploid zygote. The zygote undergoes meiosis immediately, creating four haploid cells. These cells undergo [[mitosis]] to create the organism. Many [[Fungus|fungi]] and many [[protozoa]] utilize the haplontic life cycle. {{citation needed|date=January 2011}}\n\nFinally, in the ''haplodiplontic life cycle'' (with sporic or intermediate meiosis), the living organism alternates between haploid and diploid states. Consequently, this cycle is also known as the [[alternation of generations]]. The diploid organism's germ-line cells undergo meiosis to produce spores. The spores proliferate by mitosis, growing into a haploid organism. The haploid organism's gamete then combines with another haploid organism's gamete, creating the zygote. The zygote undergoes repeated mitosis and differentiation to become a diploid organism again. The haplodiplontic life cycle can be considered a fusion of the diplontic and haplontic life cycles.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=dOaODP4Oo5kC&pg=PA121&lpg=PA121&dq=The+sporic+life+cycle+can+be+considered+a+fusion+of+the+gametic+and+zygotic+life+cycles#v=onepage&q=The%20sporic%20life%20cycle%20can%20be%20considered%20a%20fusion%20of%20the%20gametic%20and%20zygotic%20life%20cycles&f=false|title=An Introduction to Phycology| vauthors = South GR, Whittick A |date=2009-07-08|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|isbn=9781444314205|language=en}}</ref>{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}\n\n===In plants and animals===\n[[File:MitosisAndMeiosis en.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Overview of chromatides' and chromosomes' distribution within the mitotic and meiotic cycle of a male human cell]]\nMeiosis occurs in all animals and plants. The end result, the production of gametes with half the number of chromosomes as the parent cell, is the same, but the detailed process is different. In animals, meiosis produces gametes directly. In land plants and some algae, there is an [[alternation of generations]] such that meiosis in the diploid [[sporophyte]] generation produces haploid spores. These spores multiply by mitosis, developing into the haploid [[gametophyte]] generation, which then gives rise to gametes directly (i.e. without further meiosis). In both animals and plants, the final stage is for the gametes to fuse, restoring the original number of chromosomes.<ref>{{cite book|last=Bidlack|first=James E.|title=Introductory Plant Biology|year=2011|publisher=McGraw HIll|location=New York, NY|pages=214\u201329}}</ref>\n\n===In mammals===\nIn females, meiosis occurs in cells known as [[oocyte]]s (singular: oocyte). Each primary oocyte divides twice in meiosis, unequally in each case. The first division produces a daughter cell, and a much smaller polar body which may or may not undergo a second division. In meiosis II, division of the daughter cell produces a second polar body, and a single haploid cell, which enlarges to become an [[egg cell|ovum]]. Therefore, in females each primary oocyte that undergoes meiosis results in one mature ovum and one or two polar bodies.\n\nNote that there are pauses during meiosis in females. Maturing oocytes are arrested in prophase I of meiosis I and lie dormant within a protective shell of somatic cells called the [[ovarian follicle|follicle]]. At the beginning of each [[menstrual cycle]], [[follicle-stimulating hormone|FSH]] secretion from the anterior pituitary stimulates a few follicles to mature in a process known as [[folliculogenesis]]. During this process, the maturing oocytes resume meiosis and continue until metaphase II of meiosis II, where they are again arrested just before ovulation. If these oocytes are fertilized by sperm, they will resume and complete meiosis. During folliculogenesis in humans, usually one follicle becomes dominant while the others undergo [[Follicular atresia|atresia]]. The process of meiosis in females occurs during [[oogenesis]], and differs from the typical meiosis in that it features a long period of meiotic arrest known as the [[dictyate]] stage and lacks the assistance of [[centrosome]]s.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Brunet S, Verlhac MH | title = Positioning to get out of meiosis: the asymmetry of division | journal = Human Reproduction Update | volume = 17 | issue = 1 | pages = 68\u201375 | year = 2010 | pmid = 20833637 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1093/humupd/dmq044 | url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/e8c07fec6ce4306cfacbb52bcb8335383e60a58e }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Rosenbusch B | title = The contradictory information on the distribution of non-disjunction and pre-division in female gametes | journal = Human Reproduction | volume = 21 | issue = 11 | pages = 2739\u201342 | date = November 2006 | pmid = 16982661 | doi = 10.1093/humrep/del122 }}</ref>\n\nIn males, meiosis occurs during [[spermatogenesis]] in the [[seminiferous tubule]]s of the [[testicle]]s.

Meiosis of primordial germ cells happens at the time of puberty, much later than in females. Tissues of the male testis suppress meiosis by degrading retinoic acid, proposed to be a stimulator of meiosis. This is overcome at puberty when cells within seminiferous tubules called Sertoli cells start making their own retinoic acid.

When the segregation is not normal, it is called ''nondisjunction''.  This results in the production of gametes which have either too many or too few of a particular chromosome, and is a common mechanism for [[trisomy]] or [[monosomy]].  Nondisjunction can occur in the meiosis I or meiosis II, phases of cellular reproduction, or during [[mitosis]].\n\nMost monosomic and trisomic human embryos are not viable, but some aneuploidies can be tolerated, such as trisomy for the smallest chromosome, chromosome 21.
