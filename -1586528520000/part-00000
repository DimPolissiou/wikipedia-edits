Larsson began his career with [[H\u00f6gaborgs BK|H\u00f6gaborg]]. In 1992, he moved to [[Helsingborg IF|Helsingborg]] where in his first season his partnership up front with [[Mats Magnusson]] helped the club win promotion to [[Allsvenskan]] after 24 seasons in the lower tiers. He moved to [[Feyenoord]] in November 1993, staying for four years before leaving in 1997. During his time in the Dutch [[Eredivisie]], he won two [[KNVB Cup]]s with Feyenoord. He also broke into the [[Sweden national football team|Swedish national football team]], and helped them finish in third place at the [[1994 FIFA World Cup|1994 World Cup]].\n\n[[Wim Jansen]] signed Larsson for Scottish club [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] in July 1997 for a fee of \u00a3650,000. In his first season at the club, he played a crucial role in stopping [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] winning a 10th league title in a row. However, he suffered a broken leg in a [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup]] tie against [[Olympique Lyonnais|Lyon]] in 1999. Despite this setback, Larsson came back stronger, netting 53 goals in a 2000\u201301 season that saw him claim the [[European Golden Shoe]]. Larsson went on to win four league titles in his seven years at Celtic. He also helped the team reach the [[2003 UEFA Cup Final]] against [[FC Porto|Porto]], scoring both goals in a 3\u20132 defeat in \n[[Overtime (sports)|extra time]]. However, his 242 goals in 315 matches saw Celtic fans nickname him ''The King of Kings''. Larsson then joined [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]] in 2004, where he won two league titles and the [[2005\u201306 UEFA Champions League]] with a pivotal two assists in [[2006 UEFA Champions League Final|the final]]. Following the expiration of his contract at Barcelona, Larsson returned to his hometown club Helsingborg, during which time he joined [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] on a brief loan between January and March 2007. He announced his retirement from football on 20 October 2009.<ref name=LegRet>{{cite news|url=http://sport.stv.tv/football/131414-celtic-legend-larsson-to-retire-from-football/?|title=Celtic legend Larsson to retire from football|work=STV Sport|date=20 October 2009|accessdate=20 October 2009}}</ref>\n\nRegarded as one of the greatest Swedish players of all time, Larsson played for [[Sweden national football team|Sweden]] in three [[FIFA World Cup]]s and three [[UEFA European Championship]]s, winning a bronze medal at the [[1994 FIFA World Cup|1994 World Cup]], and is a former captain of the national team. He ended his international career with 37 goals in [[FIFA Century Club|106 matches]]. He also won [[Guldbollen|the Golden Ball]] (''Guldbollen''), the annual Award for best Swedish footballer twice, first in 1998 and again in 2004, while in 2003 he was named the [[UEFA Jubilee Awards|Greatest Swedish Footballer of the Last 50 Years]] as part of the [[UEFA Jubilee Awards]].\n\nIn 2010, Larsson began his career as a football manager at the [[Superettan]] club [[Landskrona BoIS]] during three seasons. He later managed [[Falkenbergs FF|Falkenberg]] in Allsvenskan, and eventually he took over at Helsingborg in 2015, where his son, [[Jordan Larsson|Jordan]] was one of his players. However, Helsingborg were relegated to Superettan in 2016 and Larsson left the club. Three years later he made a brief return in the same role at the club for just a couple of months.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.expressen.se/kvallsposten/sport/fotboll/allsvenskan/just-nu-lamnar-efter-pahopp/|title=F\u00f6r stort tryck mot honom och familjen|language=sv|publisher=Kv\u00e4llsposten|date=23 August 2019|accessdate=23 August 2019}}</ref> His son Jordan now plays for [[FC Spartak Moscow|Spartak Moscow]] and has also represented Sweden at an international level.\n\n==Early life==\nLarsson was born in [[Helsingborg]], [[Scania]].

Although naturally right footed, he was a powerful and accurate finisher with either foot from both inside and outside the penalty area, as well as his head; furthermore, he was an accurate [[Direct free kick|free-kick]] and [[Penalty kick (association football)|penalty]] taker.

He also broke into the [[Sweden national football team|Swedish national football team]], and helped them finish in third place at the [[1994 FIFA World Cup|1994 World Cup]].\n\n[[Wim Jansen]] signed Larsson for Scottish club [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] in July 1997 for a fee of \u00a3650,000. In his first season at the club, he played a crucial role in stopping [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] winning a 10th league title in a row. However, he suffered a broken leg in a [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup]] tie against [[Olympique Lyonnais|Lyon]] in 1999. Despite this setback, Larsson came back stronger, netting 53 goals in a 2000\u201301 season that saw him claim the [[European Golden Shoe]]. Larsson went on to win four league titles in his seven years at Celtic. He also helped the team reach the [[2003 UEFA Cup Final]] against [[FC Porto|Porto]], scoring both goals in a 3\u20132 defeat in \n[[Overtime (sports)|extra time]]. However, his 242 goals in 315 matches saw Celtic fans nickname him ''The King of Kings''. Larsson then joined [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]] in 2004, where he won two league titles and the [[2005\u201306 UEFA Champions League]] with a pivotal two assists in [[2006 UEFA Champions League Final|the final]]. Following the expiration of his contract at Barcelona, Larsson returned to his hometown club Helsingborg, during which time he joined [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] on a brief loan between January and March 2007. He announced his retirement from football on 20 October 2009.<ref name=LegRet>{{cite news|url=http://sport.stv.tv/football/131414-celtic-legend-larsson-to-retire-from-football/?|title=Celtic legend Larsson to retire from football|work=STV Sport|date=20 October 2009|accessdate=20 October 2009}}</ref>\n\nRegarded as one of the greatest Swedish players of all time, Larsson played for [[Sweden national football team|Sweden]] in three [[FIFA World Cup]]s and three [[UEFA European Championship]]s, winning a bronze medal at the [[1994 FIFA World Cup|1994 World Cup]], and is a former captain of the national team. He ended his international career with 37 goals in [[FIFA Century Club|106 matches]]. He also won [[Guldbollen|the Golden Ball]] (''Guldbollen''), the annual Award for best Swedish footballer twice, first in 1998 and again in 2004, while in 2003 he was named the [[UEFA Jubilee Awards|Greatest Swedish Footballer of the Last 50 Years]] as part of the [[UEFA Jubilee Awards]].\n\nIn 2010, Larsson began his career as a football manager at the [[Superettan]] club [[Landskrona BoIS]] during three seasons. He later managed [[Falkenbergs FF|Falkenberg]] in Allsvenskan, and eventually he took over at Helsingborg in 2015, where his son, [[Jordan Larsson|Jordan]] was one of his players. However, Helsingborg were relegated to Superettan in 2016 and Larsson left the club.

Complications ensue when Darcy becomes [[pregnancy|pregnant]] just before graduation and decides to keep her baby. This movie is noted for being Ringwald's final \"teen\" movie, and is cited as one of her most mature performances, particularly in a scene where Darcy is suffering from [[postpartum depression]] after the birth of her child.<ref>{{cite web|last=Stiernberg |first=Bonnie |url=http://www.pastemagazine.com/blogs/lists/2013/02/the-7-best-molly-ringwald-roles.html |title=The 7 Best Molly Ringwald Roles :: Movies :: Lists :: Paste |publisher=Pastemagazine.com |date= |accessdate=2015-01-26}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nIn [[Kenosha, Wisconsin]], Darcy, editor at her high school paper, and her steady boyfriend Stan are in their final year of high school and already have been accepted at good colleges; before Darcy goes to the [[University of Wisconsin]] to study [[journalism]], she will go on a trip to [[Paris]] with her mother for her graduation present, while Stan will go to [[Caltech]] to study [[architecture]]. With the help of Darcy's best friend Lila, Darcy and Stan spend a weekend together, where they sleep together, and Darcy becomes pregnant. They announce the news at [[Thanksgiving]], and neither Darcy's mother Donna, who was abandoned by her husband and brought up Darcy alone, nor Stan's [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] parents are very supportive. Respectively, they urge the young couple to have an [[abortion]] or give up the baby for [[adoption]]. Darcy plans to have an abortion, but does not go through with it, much to Stan's relief.\n\nAt Christmas, the kids announce their plans to keep the baby, causing a break between them and their parents. They rent a decrepit apartment and marry to the cheers of their friends, despite the fact that without parental consent the marriage is not legal. At the urging of her high school guidance counselor, who explains that other girls will want to emulate her and become adolescent mothers themselves, Darcy drops out of high school but works toward her [[GED]]. Prom is interrupted by Darcy's water breaking; although baby Thea (short for Theodosia) is healthy, Darcy suffers from [[post-partum depression]], unable to even hold her daughter, and Stan struggles to pay the bills on a part-time job salary. Only when Darcy hears an intruder (who turns out to be Stan's father) and picks up her baby protectively does she break from her depression.\n\nWithout telling Darcy, Stan sacrifices his Caltech scholarship because there is no married housing at the school for undergraduates. Stan and Darcy\u2019s relationship starts to crumble with fights and Stan drinking and being unreceptive to Darcy\u2019s attempt to plan. Although Stan takes a second, dead-end job, the bills pile up, and the couple finally moves in with Donna, which alienates Stan and Darcy, and causes Stan to continue drinking heavily. Local neighborhood girl Michaela informs Darcy of the scholarship deception so she enlists Stan's best friend Chris in a plan to ensure he take the scholarship and go to college after all. The plan entails throwing out Stan and [[annul]]ling the marriage. Stan has a bad reaction to the news and later in the night has a rage outside their house causing the police to be called. Stan reconciles with his parents, but is heartbroken over the split with Darcy, who does not change her mind but becomes visibly angrily at her mother's cold attitude.\n\nAt Darcy's night school graduation, Stan arrives to inform Darcy that he has applied for scholarships to the [[University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison]] for them both. Darcy lets slip her role in the Caltech deception with Chris, and Stan chases after her as she drives away. Darcy finally tells Donna that Stan is a good man, that she loves him and Donna can either embrace them as an entire family or watch them live their lives without her. Donna finally gets over her past and says she loves and supports Darcy fully. They reconcile, go forward on their plans to attend college in [[Madison, Wisconsin|Madison]] in the fall, and remark Thea will have a very early [[curfew]] when she is a teenager. Stan says ten p.m. and Darcy says eleven p.m. Then they say if she is really in love her curfew will be eight p.m.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Molly Ringwald]] as Darcy Bobrucz\n* [[Randall Batinkoff]] as Stan Bobrucz\n* [[Kenneth Mars]] as Mr. Bobrucz\n* [[Miriam Flynn]] as Donna Elliot\n* [[Conchata Ferrell]] as Mrs. Bobrucz\n* [[Sharon Brown (actress)|Sharon Brown]] as Lila\n* John Zarchen as Chris\n* [[Pauly Shore]] as Ryan\n* Michelle Downey as Michaela\n* [[Patricia Barry]] as Adoption Official\n* [[Janet MacLachlan]] as Miss Giles\n* Jaclyn-Rose Lester as Mary Bobrucz (as Jaclyn Bernstein)\n* Matthew Licht as Leo Bobrucz\n* [[Ren\u00e9e Estevez]] as Marnie\n* [[Darcy DeMoss]] as Elaine\n\n==Production==\n\n===Filming===\nThe film is set in [[Kenosha, Wisconsin]] and was partially filmed there. Primary location work took place in [[Winnipeg, Manitoba]], [[Canada]].\n\nThe film had a number of titles while in production, possibilities including \"Maybe, Baby\" (by which it is known in some overseas territories) and \"For Keeps?\", before settling on the final question mark-less version.\n\nJohn Zarchen suffered a life-threatening head injury while driving in Hollywood. He survived  a brief period of being comatose, and actually returned to the film, although director John Avildsen, due to his medical absence and disgusted with the actor's disregard for the opportunity and the production, greatly cut down his role. This movie also marks the film debut of [[Pauly Shore]], who appears in a small role as another friend of Stan.\n\nThe musical score features a lullaby-like version of the song \"[[Be My Baby]]\", sung by composer [[Ellie Greenwich]].\n\n===Casting===\nActor [https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0797830/ Adam Silbar] was originally cast in the lead role of Stan but, for unknown reasons, the role was later re-cast with Randall Batinkoff just weeks before the first day of production. Author and casting director [[Paul G. Bens, Jr.]], then an actor, was one of the two finalists to replace Silbar.  The role ultimately went to Batinkoff.\n\n==Release==\n\n===Critical reception===\n[[Rotten Tomatoes]] aggregate score gave the film an 18% rotten rating based on 11 reviews.<ref>{{cite web|title=''For Keeps'' (1988)|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/for_keeps/|website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|publisher=[[Flixster]]|accessdate=30 November 2014}}</ref> [[Roger Ebert]] gave the film a positive review saying, \"The movies of Molly Ringwald have been responsible for a revolution in the way Hollywood regards teenagers. Before Ringwald (and her mentor, [[John Hughes (filmmaker)|John Hughes]]) there were only horny teenagers, dead teenagers, teenage vampires and psychotic crackups. Now teenage movies are working their way through some of the aspects of the normal life of American teenagers, and in 'For Keeps,' Ringwald plays a popular high school senior who gets pregnant and gets married.\"\n\n[[Janet Maslin]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' said, \"Most of ''For Keeps'' is entirely predictable, but that should do little to diminish its interest for audiences of high-school age. Here again, Miss Ringwald is the very model of teen-age verisimilitude, and she's most impressive in making even the most hackneyed situations seem real. In fact, she's so good she's almost a problem. Mr. Batinkoff, while pleasant, is no real match for her, and the glowering parents who make their kids' lives miserable for a time are no real threat. There is the feeling that Miss Ringwald's Darcy can triumph over anything. But perhaps that's just what Mr. Avildsen had in mind.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Maslin |first=Janet |url=https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=940DE2DC173FF936A25752C0A96E948260 |title=Movie Review - For Keeps - Film: 'For Keeps,' on Teen-Age Pregnancy |publisher=NYTimes.com |date=1988-01-15 |accessdate=2015-01-26}}</ref>\n\nJudge Brian Pope gave a positive review saying, \"Pretty but approachable, smart but funny, cool but sweet, Ringwald represented everything most high-school girls wanted to be: the girl next door who always got the guy without compromising her values. Small wonder she is still regarded as an icon of 1980s teen cinema. It wasn't until Ringwald began dipping her toes into slightly more adult roles that she lost her footing. Take 'For Keeps', for instance. This movie dared to suggest that even a popular honors student is capable of making wrong decisions that result in life-changing consequences. More crucially, Ringwald suggested to her fans that the qualities they found so endearing in her aren't always adequate substitutes for natural maturity. Perhaps that was a bitter pill for her fans to swallow, but it's not such a bad message, and, more than 15 years after its release, 'For Keeps' isn't such a bad movie.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dvdverdict.com/reviews/forkeeps.php |title=DVD Verdict Review - For Keeps |publisher=Dvdverdict.com |date=2004-05-11 |accessdate=2015-01-26 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140831195031/http://www.dvdverdict.com/reviews/forkeeps.php |archivedate=2014-08-31 }}</ref>\n\nDavid Nusair gave a more negative review saying, \"For Keeps takes a potentially intriguing subject (two teenagers attempting to start their lives together) and piles on cliche after cliche, until it's about as compelling as an afterschool special.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.reelfilm.com/mini9.htm#forkeeps |title=Mini Reviews (August 2001) - Reviews by David Nusair |publisher=Reelfilm.com |date= |accessdate=2015-01-26}}</ref>\n\n===Box office===\nIn January 1988, the film debuted at #4 at the box office (behind ''[[Good Morning, Vietnam]]'', ''[[Three Men and a Baby]]'', and ''[[Moonstruck]]'').<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/weekend/chart/?view=&yr=1988&wknd=05&p=.htm |title=Weekend Box Office Results for January 29-31, 1988 |publisher=Box Office Mojo |date= |accessdate=2015-01-26}}</ref> Grossing $17,514,553 domestically,<ref name=\"boxofficemojo1\"/> the film is a box office success given its estimated budget of $10 million.\n\n===Home media===\nOn March 23, 2004 the film was released on [[DVD]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdsreleasedates.com/movies/888/For-Keeps?-(1988).html |title=For Keeps?

Complications ensue when Darcy becomes [[pregnancy|pregnant]] just before graduation and decides to keep her baby.  This movie is noted for being Ringwald's final \"teen\" movie, and is cited as one of her most mature performances, particularly in a scene where Darcy is suffering from [[postpartum depression]] after the birth of her child.<ref>{{cite web|last=Stiernberg |first=Bonnie |url=http://www.pastemagazine.com/blogs/lists/2013/02/the-7-best-molly-ringwald-roles.html |title=The 7 Best Molly Ringwald Roles :: Movies :: Lists :: Paste |publisher=Pastemagazine.com |date= |accessdate=2015-01-26}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nIn [[Kenosha, Wisconsin]], Darcy, editor at her high school paper, and her steady boyfriend Stan are in their final year of high school and already have been accepted at good colleges; before Darcy goes to the [[University of Wisconsin]] to study [[journalism]], she will go on a trip to [[Paris]] with her mother for her graduation present, while Stan will go to [[Caltech]] to study [[architecture]]. With the help of Darcy's best friend Lila, Darcy and Stan spend a weekend together, where they sleep together, and Darcy becomes pregnant. They announce the news at [[Thanksgiving]], and neither Darcy's mother Donna, who was abandoned by her husband and brought up Darcy alone, nor Stan's [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] parents are very supportive. Respectively, they urge the young couple to have an [[abortion]] or give up the baby for [[adoption]]. Darcy plans to have an abortion, but does not go through with it, much to Stan's relief.\n\nAt Christmas, the kids announce their plans to keep the baby, causing a break between them and their parents. They rent a decrepit apartment and get married to the cheers of their friends, despite the fact that without parental consent the marriage is not legal. At the urging of her high school guidance counselor, who explains that other girls will want to emulate her and become teenaged mothers themselves, Darcy drops out of high school but works toward her [[GED]]. Prom is interrupted by Darcy's water breaking; although baby Thea (short for Theodosia) is healthy, Darcy suffers from [[post-partum depression]], unable to even hold her daughter, and Stan struggles to pay the bills on a part-time job salary. Only when Darcy hears an intruder (who turns out to be Stan's father) and picks up her baby protectively does she break from her depression.\n\nWithout telling Darcy, Stan sacrifices his Caltech scholarship because there is no married housing at the school for undergraduates. Stan and Darcy\u2019s relationship starts to crumble with fights and Stan drinking and being unreceptive to Darcy\u2019s attempt to plan. Although Stan takes a second, dead-end job, the bills pile up, and the couple finally moves in with Donna, which alienates Stan and Darcy, and causes Stan to continue drinking heavily. Local neighborhood girl Michaela informs Darcy of the scholarship deception so she enlists Stan's best friend Chris in a plan to ensure he take the scholarship and go to college after all. The plan entails throwing out Stan and [[annul]]ling the marriage. Stan has a bad reaction to the news and later in the night has a rage outside their house causing the police to be called. Stan reconciles with his parents, but is heartbroken over the split with Darcy, who does not change her mind but becomes visibly angrily at her mother's cold attitude.\n\nAt Darcy's night school graduation, Stan arrives to inform Darcy that he has applied for scholarships to the [[University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison]] for them both. Darcy lets slip her role in the Caltech deception with Chris, and Stan chases after her as she drives away. Darcy finally tells Donna that Stan is a good man, that she loves him and Donna can either embrace them as an entire family or watch them live their lives without her. Donna finally gets over her past and says she loves and supports Darcy fully. They reconcile, go forward on their plans to attend college in [[Madison, Wisconsin|Madison]] in the fall, and remark Thea will have a very early [[curfew]] when she is a teenager. Stan says ten p.m. and Darcy says eleven p.m. Then they say if she is really in love her curfew will be eight p.m.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Molly Ringwald]] as Darcy Bobrucz\n* [[Randall Batinkoff]] as Stan Bobrucz\n* [[Kenneth Mars]] as Mr. Bobrucz\n* [[Miriam Flynn]] as Donna Elliot\n* [[Conchata Ferrell]] as Mrs. Bobrucz\n* [[Sharon Brown (actress)|Sharon Brown]] as Lila\n* John Zarchen as Chris\n* [[Pauly Shore]] as Ryan\n* Michelle Downey as Michaela\n* [[Patricia Barry]] as Adoption Official\n* [[Janet MacLachlan]] as Miss Giles\n* Jaclyn-Rose Lester as Mary Bobrucz (as Jaclyn Bernstein)\n* Matthew Licht as Leo Bobrucz\n* [[Ren\u00e9e Estevez]] as Marnie\n* [[Darcy DeMoss]] as Elaine\n\n==Production==\n\n===Filming===\nThe film is set in [[Kenosha, Wisconsin]] and was partially filmed there. Primary location work took place in [[Winnipeg, Manitoba]], [[Canada]].\n\nThe film had a number of titles while in production, possibilities including \"Maybe, Baby\" (by which it is known in some overseas territories) and \"For Keeps?\", before settling on the final question mark-less version.\n\nJohn Zarchen suffered a life-threatening head injury while driving in Hollywood. He survived  a brief period of being comatose, and actually returned to the film, although director John Avildsen, due to his medical absence and disgusted with the actor's disregard for the opportunity and the production, greatly cut down his role.  This movie also marks the film debut of [[Pauly Shore]], who appears in a small role as another friend of Stan.\n\nThe musical score features a lullaby-like version of the song \"[[Be My Baby]]\", sung by composer [[Ellie Greenwich]].\n\n===Casting===\nActor [https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0797830/ Adam Silbar] was originally cast in the lead role of Stan but, for unknown reasons, the role was later re-cast with Randall Batinkoff just weeks before the first day of production. Author and casting director [[Paul G. Bens, Jr.]], then an actor, was one of the two finalists to replace Silbar.  The role ultimately went to Batinkoff.\n\n==Release==\n\n===Critical reception===\n[[Rotten Tomatoes]] aggregate score gave the film an 18% rotten rating based on 11 reviews.<ref>{{cite web|title=''For Keeps'' (1988)|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/for_keeps/|website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|publisher=[[Flixster]]|accessdate=30 November 2014}}</ref> [[Roger Ebert]] gave the film a positive review saying, \"The movies of Molly Ringwald have been responsible for a revolution in the way Hollywood regards teenagers. Before Ringwald (and her mentor, [[John Hughes (filmmaker)|John Hughes]]) there were only horny teenagers, dead teenagers, teenage vampires and psychotic crackups. Now teenage movies are working their way through some of the aspects of the normal life of American teenagers, and in 'For Keeps,' Ringwald plays a popular high school senior who gets pregnant and gets married.\"\n\n[[Janet Maslin]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' said, \"Most of ''For Keeps'' is entirely predictable, but that should do little to diminish its interest for audiences of high-school age. Here again, Miss Ringwald is the very model of teen-age verisimilitude, and she's most impressive in making even the most hackneyed situations seem real. In fact, she's so good she's almost a problem. Mr. Batinkoff, while pleasant, is no real match for her, and the glowering parents who make their kids' lives miserable for a time are no real threat. There is the feeling that Miss Ringwald's Darcy can triumph over anything. But perhaps that's just what Mr. Avildsen had in mind.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Maslin |first=Janet |url=https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=940DE2DC173FF936A25752C0A96E948260 |title=Movie Review - For Keeps - Film: 'For Keeps,' on Teen-Age Pregnancy |publisher=NYTimes.com |date=1988-01-15 |accessdate=2015-01-26}}</ref>\n\nJudge Brian Pope gave a positive review saying, \"Pretty but approachable, smart but funny, cool but sweet, Ringwald represented everything most high-school girls wanted to be: the girl next door who always got the guy without compromising her values. Small wonder she is still regarded as an icon of '80s teen cinema. It wasn't until Ringwald began dipping her toes into slightly more adult roles that she lost her footing. Take 'For Keeps', for instance. This movie dared to suggest that even a popular honors student is capable of making wrong decisions that result in life-changing consequences. More crucially, Ringwald suggested to her fans that the qualities they found so endearing in her aren't always adequate substitutes for natural maturity. Perhaps that was a bitter pill for her fans to swallow, but it's not such a bad message, and, more than 15 years after its release, 'For Keeps' isn't such a bad movie.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dvdverdict.com/reviews/forkeeps.php |title=DVD Verdict Review - For Keeps |publisher=Dvdverdict.com |date=2004-05-11 |accessdate=2015-01-26 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140831195031/http://www.dvdverdict.com/reviews/forkeeps.php |archivedate=2014-08-31 }}</ref>\n\nDavid Nusair gave a more negative review saying, \"For Keeps takes a potentially intriguing subject (two teenagers attempting to start their lives together) and piles on cliche after cliche, until it's about as compelling as an afterschool special.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.reelfilm.com/mini9.htm#forkeeps |title=Mini Reviews (August 2001) - Reviews by David Nusair |publisher=Reelfilm.com |date= |accessdate=2015-01-26}}</ref>\n\n===Box office===\nIn January 1988, the film debuted at #4 at the box office (behind ''[[Good Morning, Vietnam]]'', ''[[Three Men and a Baby]]'', and ''[[Moonstruck]]'').<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/weekend/chart/?view=&yr=1988&wknd=05&p=.htm |title=Weekend Box Office Results for January 29-31, 1988 |publisher=Box Office Mojo |date= |accessdate=2015-01-26}}</ref> Grossing $17,514,553 domestically,<ref name=\"boxofficemojo1\"/> the film is a box office success given its estimated budget of $10 million.\n\n===Home media===\nOn March 23, 2004 the film was released on [[DVD]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdsreleasedates.com/movies/888/For-Keeps?-(1988).html |title=For Keeps?

The area formed part of the holdings of [[Aizu Domain]] during the [[Edo period]]. After the [[Meiji Restoration]], it was organized as part of [[Yama District, Fukushima|Yama District]], Fukushima Prefecture. Bandai village was created on March 31, 1889 with the establishment of the modern municipalities system, and was raised to town status in 1960.\n\n==Economy==\nFrom the early modern period, hydroelectric power generation and chemical production by [[Nippon Soda Co., Ltd.]] had been mainstays of the local economy. However, the local economy has now shifted to precision machinery production and seasonal tourism, especially golf courses and ski resorts.\n\n==Education==\nBandai has two public elementary schools and one public junior high school operated by the town government.
