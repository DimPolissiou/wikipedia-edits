Phillips suggests that Isha Upanishad was likely one of the earliest Upanishads, composed in the 1st half of 1st millennium BCE, after Brihadaranyaka and Chandogya, but before Taittiriya, Aitareya, Kaushitaki, Kena, Katha, Manduka, Prasna, Svetasvatara and Maitri Upanishads, as well as before the earliest Buddhist Pali and Jaina canons.<ref name=stephenphillips/>\n\nEarlier 19th and 20th-century scholars have similarly expressed a spectrum of views. Isha Upanishad has been chronologically listed by them as being among early Upanishads to being one among the middle Upanishads. [[Paul Deussen|Deussen]]<ref>Paul Deussen, [https://archive.org/stream/philosophyoftheupa00deusuoft#page/n39/mode/2up The Philosophy of the Upanishads], pages 22-26</ref> suggested, for example, that Isha was composed after ancient prose Upanishads - Brihadaranyaka, Chandogya, Taittiriya, Aitareya, Kaushitaki and Kena; during a period when metrical poem-like Upanishads were being composed. Further, he suggests that ''Isha'' was composed before other prose Upanishads such as Prasna, Maitri, Mandukya and all post-Vedic era Upanishads.\n\nWinternitz,<ref>M Winternitz (2010), History of Indian Literature, Vol 1, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120802643}}</ref> suggests that Isha Upanishad was probably a pre-Buddha composition along with Katha, Svetasvatara, Mundaka and Prasna Upanishad, but after the first phase of ancient Upanishads that were composed in prose such as Brihadaranyaka, Chandogya, Taittiriya, Aitareya, Kaushitaki and Kena.

Wellcome L0027330.jpg|thumb|360px|A manuscript page from the Isha Upanisad.]]\nIsha Upanishad is the only Upanishad that is attached to a [[Samhita]], the most ancient layer of Vedic text known for their mantras and benedictions. Other Upanishads are attached to a later layer of Vedic texts such as [[Brahmanas]] and [[Aranyaka]]s. Max Muller notes that this does not necessarily mean that Isha Upanishad is among the oldest,<ref name=mmullercci>Max Muller (Translator), [https://archive.org/stream/upanishads01ml#page/n107/mode/2up Vajasaneyi Samhita Upanishad], Oxford University Press, Introduction section pages c-ci</ref> because Shukla Yajur Veda is acknowledged to be of a later origin than textual layers of other Vedas such as the Rig Veda.\n\nThe 8th-century Indian scholar [[Adi Shankara]], in his ''Bhasya'' (review and commentary) noted that the mantras and hymns of Isha Upanishad are not used in rituals, because their purpose is to enlighten the reader as to \"what is the nature of soul (Atman)?\"; the Upanishad, thus, despite Yajurveda Samhita's liturgical focus, has not historically served as a liturgical text.<ref name=mmullercci/><ref name=adishankaraisha>[https://archive.org/stream/upanishadssrisan00sita#page/n7/mode/2up The Isa, Kena and Mundaka Upanishads and Sri Sankara's Commentary] Adi Shankara, SS Sastri (Translator), pages 1-29</ref> Isha Upanishad is a philosophical text.<ref name=charlesjohnstoncomments>Charles Johnston (1920), {{Google books|8ZUBBQAAQBAJ|The Mukhya Upanishads: Books of Hidden Wisdom}}, Reprinted by Ksetra Books, pages 49-83</ref>\n\n===Difference between recensions===\nThe Isha Upanishad manuscript differs in the two [[shakha]]s of the [[Yajurveda#Shukla Yajurveda|Shukla Yajurveda]]. These are called the Kanva (VSK) and Madhyandina (VSM) recensions. The order of verses 1\u20138 is the same in both, however, Kanva verses 9\u201314 correspond to Madhyandina verses 12, 13, 14, 9, 10, 11. Madhyandina verse 17 is a variation of Kanva 15, Kanva verse 16 is missing in Madhyandina, and Kanva verses 17\u201318 correspond to Madhyandina 15\u201316.\n\nIn both recensions, the Isha Upanishad is the 40th chapter of Shukla Yajur Veda. Versions with 18 verses refer to Kanva, while those with 17 verses are referring to the Madhyandina.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| Kanva 40 || 1 || 2 || 3 || 4 || 5 || 6 || 7 || 8 || 9 || 10 || 11 || 12 || 13 || 14 || 15 || 16 || 17 || 18\n|-\n| Madhyandina 40 || 1 || 2 || 3 || 4 || 5 || 6 || 7 || 8 || 12 || 13 || 14 || 9 || 10 || 11 || (17) || \u2013 || 15 || 16\n|-\n|}\n\n==Content==\n{{Hindu scriptures |expanded=Upanishads}}\n\n===Monism versus theism===\nThe Isha Upanishad is significant for its singular mention of the term \"[[Ishvara|Isha]]\" in the first hymn, a term it never repeats in other hymns. The concept \"Isha\" exhibits [[monism]] in one interpretation, or a form of [[monotheism in Hinduism|monotheism]] in an alternative interpretation, referred to as \"Self\" or \"Deity Lord\" respectively.\n\n{{Quote|\nEnveloped by the Lord must be This All \u2014 each thing that moves on earth.\nWith that renounced, enjoy thyself.

For example, the more recent scholar [[Mah\u012bdhara]] suggested that hymn 1 may be referring to Buddha, an interpretation that Max Muller stated was inadmissible because of the fundamental difference between Hinduism and Buddhism, with Hinduism relying on the premise \"Soul, Self exists\" and Buddhism relying on the premise \"Soul, Self does not exist\".<ref name=maxmullercomments/><ref>John C.

As we have already observed, this is the basic and ineradicable distinction between Hinduism and Buddhism\".</ref>\n\n===Pursuit of Karma versus pursuit of Self===\nThe Isha Upanishad, in hymns 2\u20136, acknowledges the contrasting tension within Hinduism, between the empirical life of householder and action ([[karma]]) and the spiritual life of renunciation and knowledge ([[jnana]]).<ref name=ralphgriffith/>\n{{Quote|\nShould one wish to live a hundred years on this earth, he should live doing Karma.

For liberation, know your Atman, which is motionless yet faster than mind, it is distant, it is near, it is within all, it is without all this. It is all pervading. And he who beholds all beings in the Self, and the Self in all beings, he never turns away from it [the Self].\n|Isha Upanishad, Hymns 2-6<ref name=adishankaraisha/><ref name=maxmullertrans>Max Muller (Translator), [https://archive.org/stream/upanishads01ml#page/310/mode/2up Vajasaneyi Samhita Upanishad], Oxford University Press, pages 311-314</ref>}}\n\nAdi Shankara suggests that \"he\" in hymn 6 (last sentence in above quote) is the \"seeker of emancipation, on a journey to realize Self and Oneness in innermost self and everyone, and includes those in [[sannyasa]]\";<ref name=adishankaraisha/> while Madhvacharya suggests \"he\" is \"the individual soul in loving devotion of God, seeking to get infinitely close to the God soul\".<ref name=madhavabhasya/>\n\nMax Muller, in his review of commentaries by many ancient and medieval Indian scholars,<ref name=maxmullercomments/> states that these verses of Isha Upanishad are proclaiming the \"uselessness of all rituals, whether related to sacrifices or precepts of [[dharma]]\", but simultaneously acknowledging the \"harmlessness and necessity of social activity, that may be seen as potentially intermediate preparation to the path of Knowledge\". The Isha Upanishad, is reminding the reader that neither routine life and rituals are right nor are they wrong, states Max Muller.<ref name=maxmullercomments/> They may be necessary to many, nevertheless, to prepare a person for emancipation, to show the path where cravings feel meaningless, and to produce a serene mind that longs for meaning and one that can discern highest knowledge.<ref name=maxmullercomments/> Ralph Griffith suggests the verses 2-6 of Isha Upanishad are condemning those who perform ''Karma'' in order to \"get future advantages in life or to gain a place in heaven\", because that is ignorance. The avoidance of \"soul knowledge and its eternal, all-pervasive nature\" is akin to \"killing one's soul\" and living a dead life opines Isha Upanishad, states Griffith.<ref name=ralphgriffith/> The pursuit of Self is the seeking of the eternal, the whole, the all-transcending, the self-depending, the Oneness and law of all nature and existence.<ref>Astrid Fitzgerald (2002), Being Consciousness Bliss: A Seeker's Guide, Steiner, {{ISBN|978-0970109781}}, page 52</ref>\n\n===Vidya versus Avidya===\nThe Isha Upanishad suggests that one root of sorrow and suffering is considering one's Self as distinct and conflicted with the Self of others, assuming that the nature of existence is a conflicted duality where one's happiness and suffering is viewed as different from another living being's happiness and suffering. Such sorrow and suffering cannot exist, suggests the Upanishad, if an individual realizes that the Self is in all things, understands the Oneness in all of existence, focuses beyond individual egos and in the pursuit of Universal values, the Self and Real Knowledge.<ref name=charlesjohnstoncomments/>\n{{Quote|\nWhen to a man who understands,<br>\nthe Self has become all things,<br>\nwhat sorrow, what trouble can there be,<br>\nto him who beholds that unity.\n|Isha Upanishad, Hymn 7<ref name=maxmullertrans/>}}\n\nThe Isha Upanishad, in hymn 8 through 11, praises the study of ''Vidya'' (Real Knowledge, eternal truths) and ''Avidya'' (not Real Knowledge, empirical truths).<ref name=maxmullercomments/><ref>Richard H.

Isha Upanishad has been chronologically listed by them as being among early Upanishads to being one among the middle Upanishads. [[Paul Deussen|Deussen]]<ref>Paul Deussen, [https://archive.org/stream/philosophyoftheupa00deusuoft#page/n39/mode/2up The Philosophy of the Upanishads], pages 22-26</ref> suggested, for example, that Isha was composed after ancient prose Upanishads - Brihadaranyaka, Chandogya, Taittiriya, Aitareya, Kaushitaki and Kena; during a period when metrical poem-like Upanishads were being composed. Further, he suggests that ''Isha'' was composed before other prose Upanishads such as Prasna, Maitri, Mandukya and all post-Vedic era Upanishads.\n\nWinternitz,<ref>M Winternitz (2010), History of Indian Literature, Vol 1, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120802643}}</ref> suggests that Isha Upanishad was probably a pre-Buddha composition along with Katha, Svetasvatara, Mundaka and Prasna Upanishad, but after the first phase of ancient Upanishads that were composed in prose such as Brihadaranyaka, Chandogya, Taittiriya, Aitareya, Kaushitaki and Kena.

Wellcome L0027330.jpg|thumb|360px|A manuscript page from the Isha Upanisad.]]\nIsha Upanishad is the only Upanishad that is attached to a [[Samhita]], the most ancient layer of Vedic text known for their mantras and benedictions. Other Upanishads are attached to a later layer of Vedic texts such as [[Brahmanas]] and [[Aranyaka]]s.

These are called the Kanva (VSK) and Madhyandina (VSM) recensions. The order of verses 1\u20138 is the same in both, however, Kanva verses 9\u201314 correspond to Madhyandina verses 12, 13, 14, 9, 10, 11. Madhyandina verse 17 is a variation of Kanva 15, Kanva verse 16 is missing in Madhyandina, and Kanva verses 17\u201318 correspond to Madhyandina 15\u201316.\n\nIn both recensions, the Isha Upanishad is the 40th chapter of Shukla Yajur Veda. Versions with 18 verses refer to Kanva, while those with 17 verses are referring to the Madhyandina.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| Kanva 40 || 1 || 2 || 3 || 4 || 5 || 6 || 7 || 8 || 9 || 10 || 11 || 12 || 13 || 14 || 15 || 16 || 17 || 18\n|-\n| Madhyandina 40 || 1 || 2 || 3 || 4 || 5 || 6 || 7 || 8 || 12 || 13 || 14 || 9 || 10 || 11 || (17) || \u2013 || 15 || 16\n|-\n|}\n\n==Content==\n{{Hindu scriptures |expanded=Upanishads}}\n\n===Monism versus theism===\nThe Isha Upanishad is significant for its singular mention of the term \"[[Ishvara|Isha]]\" in the first hymn, a term it never repeats in other hymns. The concept \"Isha\" exhibits [[monism]] in one interpretation, or a form of [[monotheism in Hinduism|monotheism]] in an alternative interpretation, referred to as \"Self\" or \"Deity Lord\" respectively.\n\n{{Quote|\nEnveloped by the Lord must be This All \u2014 each thing that moves on earth.\nWith that renounced, enjoy thyself.

For example, the more recent scholar [[Mah\u012bdhara]] suggested that hymn 1 may be referring to Buddha, an interpretation that Max Muller stated was inadmissible because of the fundamental difference between Hinduism and Buddhism, with Hinduism relying on the premise \"Soul, Self exists\" and Buddhism relying on the premise \"Soul, Self does not exist\".<ref name=maxmullercomments/><ref>John C.

The Isha Upanishad, is reminding the reader that neither routine life and rituals are right nor are they wrong, states Max Muller.<ref name=maxmullercomments/> They may be necessary to many, nevertheless, to prepare a person for emancipation, to show the path where cravings feel meaningless, and to produce a serene mind that longs for meaning and one that can discern highest knowledge.<ref name=maxmullercomments/> Ralph Griffith suggests the verses 2-6 of Isha Upanishad are condemning those who perform ''Karma'' in order to \"get future advantages in life or to gain a place in heaven\", because that is ignorance. The avoidance of \"soul knowledge and its eternal, all-pervasive nature\" is akin to \"killing one's soul\" and living a dead life opines Isha Upanishad, states Griffith.<ref name=ralphgriffith/> The pursuit of Self is the seeking of the eternal, the whole, the all-transcending, the self-depending, the Oneness and law of all nature and existence.<ref>Astrid Fitzgerald (2002), Being Consciousness Bliss: A Seeker's Guide, Steiner, {{ISBN|978-0970109781}}, page 52</ref>\n\n===Vidya versus Avidya===\nThe Isha Upanishad suggests that one root of sorrow and suffering is considering one's Self as distinct and conflicted with the Self of others, assuming that the nature of existence is a conflicted duality where one's happiness and suffering is viewed as different from another living being's happiness and suffering. Such sorrow and suffering cannot exist, suggests the Upanishad, if an individual realizes that the Self is in all things, understands the Oneness in all of existence, focuses beyond individual egos and in the pursuit of Universal values, the Self and Real Knowledge.<ref name=charlesjohnstoncomments/>\n{{Quote|\nWhen to a man who understands,<br>\nthe Self has become all things,<br>\nwhat sorrow, what trouble can there be,<br>\nto him who beholds that unity.\n|Isha Upanishad, Hymn 7<ref name=maxmullertrans/>}}\n\nThe Isha Upanishad, in hymn 8 through 11, praises the study of ''Vidya'' (Real Knowledge, eternal truths) and ''Avidya'' (not Real Knowledge, empirical truths).<ref name=maxmullercomments/><ref>Richard H.
