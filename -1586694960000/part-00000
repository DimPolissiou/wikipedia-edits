The ideology of asceticism and renunciation seems, at first, discontinuous with the brahmanical ideology of the affirmation of social obligations and the performance of public and domestic rituals. Indeed, there has been some debate as to whether asceticism and its ideas of retributive action, reincarnation and spiritual liberation, might not have originated outside the orthodox vedic sphere, or even outside Aryan culture: that a divergent historical origin might account for the apparent contradiction within 'Hinduism' between the world affirmation of the householder and the world negation of the renouncer. However, this dichotomization is too simplistic, for continuities can undoubtedly be found between renunciation and vedic Brahmanism, while elements from non-Brahmanical, Sramana traditions also played an important part in the formation of the renunciate ideal. Indeed there are continuities between vedic Brahmanism and Buddhism, and it has been argued that the Buddha sought to return to the ideals of a vedic society which he saw as being eroded in his own day.\"{{sfn|Flood|1996|pp=76\u201377}}}}}}\n\nPre-philosophical speculations of yoga begin to emerge in the texts of {{circa|500|200&nbsp;BCE}}.

The [[metaphysics]] of Classical Yoga, like S\u0101\u1e45khya, is mainly [[Dualism (Indian philosophy)|dualistic]], positing that there are two distinct realities. These are ''[[prakriti]]'' (nature), which is the eternal and active unconscious source of the material world and is composed of [[Three Gunas|three gunas]], and the ''puru\u1e63a''s (persons), the plural consciousnesses which are the intelligent principles of the world, and are multiple, inactive and eternal witnesses. Each person has an individual ''puru\u1e63a,'' which is their true self, the witness and the enjoyer, and that which is liberated. This metaphysical system holds that ''puru\u1e63a''s undergo cycles of reincarnation through its interaction and identification with ''prakirti''. Liberation, the goal of this system, results from the isolation (''[[kaivalya]])'' of ''puru\u1e63a'' from ''prakirti,'' and is achieved through a meditation which detaches oneself from the different forms ([[Tattva|''tattvas'']]) of ''prakirti''.<ref>Ruzsa, Ferenc, [https://www.iep.utm.edu/sankhya/ Sankhya, Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy.]</ref> This is done by stilling one's thought waves (''citta vritti'') and resting in pure awareness of ''puru\u1e63a.''\n\nUnlike the S\u0101\u1e45khya school of Hinduism, which pursues a non-theistic/atheistic rationalist approach,<ref name=\"lpfl\">Lloyd Pflueger, Person Purity and Power in Yogasutra, in Theory and Practice of Yoga (Editor: Knut Jacobsen), Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120832329}}, pages 38\u201339</ref><ref>Mike Burley (2012), Classical Samkhya and Yoga \u2013 An Indian Metaphysics of Experience, Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0-415-64887-5}}, pages 43\u201346</ref> the Yoga school of Hinduism accepts the concept of a \"personal, yet essentially inactive, deity\" or \"personal god\" ([[Ishvara|Isvara]]).<ref>Kovoor T.

It is also associated with ''[[samadhi]]'' (mental unification, focus) and ''dhyana'' (a state of meditative absorption). ''[[Vipassan\u0101]]'' meanwhile, is a kind of insight or penetrative understanding into the true nature of phenomena. It is also defined as \"seeing things as they truly are\" (''yath\u0101bh\u016bta\u1e43 dar\u015banam''). The true nature of things is defined and explained in different ways, but an important and unique feature of classical Buddhism is its understanding of all phenomena (''[[dhammas]]'') as being empty of a self (''[[\u0100tman (Hinduism)|atman]]'') or inherent essence, a doctrine termed ''[[Anatta]]'' (\"not-self\") and ''[[\u015a\u016bnyat\u0101]]'' (emptiness).<ref>Buswell, Robert, ed.

''[[Vipassan\u0101]]'' also requires an understanding of suffering or ''dukkha'' (and thus the [[Four Noble Truths|four noble truths]]), impermanence (''[[Impermanence|anicca]]'') and [[Prat\u012btyasamutp\u0101da|interdependent origination]].\n\nLater developments in the various Buddhist traditions led to new innovations in yogic practices. The [[Theravada]] school, while remaining relatively conservative, still developed new ideas on meditation and yogic phenomenology in their later works, the most influential of which is the [[Visuddhimagga]]. The Indic meditation teachings of [[Mahayana|Mahayana Buddhism]] can be seen in influential texts like the [[Yogacarabhumi-sastra|''Yog\u0101c\u0101rabh\u016bmi-\u015a\u0101stra'']] (compiled c. 4th century). Mahayana meditation practices also developed and adopted new yogic methods, such as the use of [[mantra]] and [[dharani]], [[Pure Land Buddhism|pure land practices]] which aimed at rebirth in a [[Pure land|pure land or buddhafield]], and visualization methods. Chinese Buddhism developed its own methods, such as the Chan practice of [[K\u014dan|Koan]] introspection and [[Hua Tou]]. Likewise, [[Vajrayana|Tantric Buddhism]] (also Mantrayana, Vajrayana) developed and adopted tantric methods, which remain the basis of the Tibetan Buddhist yogic systems, including the [[Six Dharmas of Naropa|Six yogas of Naropa]], [[Kalacakra Tantra|Kalacakra]], [[Mahamudra]] and [[Dzogchen]].<ref>Feuerstein (2002), pp. 230-241.</ref>\n\n=== Jain yoga ===\n{{Main|Jain meditation}}\n\nJain yoga has been a central practice in [[Jainism]].

Later works include [[Kundakunda|Kundakunda's]] ''V\u0101rassa-a\u1e47uvekkh\u0101'' (\u201cTwelve Contemplations\u201d, c. 1st century BCE to 1st century CE), [[Haribhadra]]'s [[Yogad\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6disamuccaya|''Yogad\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6disamuccya'']] (8th century)  and the [[Yoga\u015b\u0101stra]] of [[Hemachandra]] (12th century). Later forms of Jain yoga adopted Hindu influences, such as ideas from Patanjali's yoga and later Tantric yoga (in the works of Haribhadra and Hemachandra respectively). The Jains also developed a progressive path to liberation through yogic praxis, outlining several levels of virtue called [[Gunasthana|''gunasthanas'']].\n\nIn the modern era, new forms of Jain meditation have also been developed. One of the most influential ones is the ''prek\u1e63\u0101'' system of \u0100c\u0101rya [[Mah\u0101praj\u00f1a]] which is eclectic and includes the use of mantra, breath control, mudras, bandhas, and so on.\n\n=== Yoga in Advaita Vedanta ===\n[[File:Raja Ravi Varma - Sankaracharya.jpg|thumb|upright|''[[Adi Shankara]] with Disciples'', by [[Raja Ravi Varma]] (1904).

Regarding yoga or meditation, the Brahma sutras focuses on gaining spiritual knowledge of [[Brahman]], the unchanging absolute reality or Self.<ref>George Thibaut, Vedanta Sutras Part 1, ''The Sacred Books of the East'' at [[Google Books]], Volume 34 (Editor: Max Muller), Oxford University Press, pages lxxii-lxxiii</ref>\n\nOne of the earliest and most influential sub-traditions of Vedanta, is [[Advaita Vedanta]], which posits [[Nondualism|nondualistic]] [[monism]].

However, this dichotomization is too simplistic, for continuities can undoubtedly be found between renunciation and vedic Brahmanism, while elements from non-Brahmanical, Sramana traditions also played an important part in the formation of the renunciate ideal.

The [[metaphysics]] of Classical Yoga, like S\u0101\u1e45khya, is mainly [[Dualism (Indian philosophy)|dualistic]], positing that there are two distinct realities. These are ''[[prakriti]]'' (nature), which is the eternal and active unconscious source of the material world and is composed of [[Three Gunas|three gunas]], and the ''puru\u1e63a''s (persons), the plural consciousnesses which are the intelligent principles of the world, and are multiple, inactive and eternal witnesses.

Liberation, the goal of this system, results from the isolation (''[[kaivalya]])'' of ''puru\u1e63a'' from ''prakirti,'' and is achieved through a meditation which detaches oneself from the different forms ([[Tattva|''tattvas'']]) of ''prakirti''.<ref>Ruzsa, Ferenc, [https://www.iep.utm.edu/sankhya/ Sankhya, Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy.]</ref> This is done by stilling one's thought waves (''citta vritti'') and resting in pure awareness of ''puru\u1e63a.''\n\nUnlike the S\u0101\u1e45khya school of Hinduism, which pursues a non-theistic/atheistic rationalist approach,<ref name=\"lpfl\">Lloyd Pflueger, Person Purity and Power in Yogasutra, in Theory and Practice of Yoga (Editor: Knut Jacobsen), Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120832329}}, pages 38\u201339</ref><ref>Mike Burley (2012), Classical Samkhya and Yoga \u2013 An Indian Metaphysics of Experience, Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0-415-64887-5}}, pages 43\u201346</ref> the Yoga school of Hinduism accepts the concept of a \"personal, yet essentially inactive, deity\" or \"personal god\" ([[Ishvara|Isvara]]).<ref>Kovoor T.

It is also associated with ''[[samadhi]]'' (mental unification, focus) and ''dhyana'' (a state of meditative absorption). ''[[Vipassan\u0101]]'' meanwhile, is a kind of insight or penetrative understanding into the true nature of phenomena. It is also defined as \"seeing things as they truly are\" (''yath\u0101bh\u016bta\u1e43 dar\u015banam''). The true nature of things is defined and explained in different ways, but an important and unique feature of classical Buddhism is its understanding of all phenomena (''[[dhammas]]'') as being empty of a self (''[[\u0100tman (Hinduism)|atman]]'') or inherent essence, a doctrine termed ''[[Anatta]]'' (\"not-self\") and ''[[\u015a\u016bnyat\u0101]]'' (emptiness).<ref>Buswell, Robert, ed.

''[[Vipassan\u0101]]'' also requires an understanding of suffering or ''dukkha'' (and thus the [[Four Noble Truths|four noble truths]]), impermanence (''[[Impermanence|anicca]]'') and [[Prat\u012btyasamutp\u0101da|interdependent origination]].\n\nLater developments in the various Buddhist traditions led to new innovations in yogic practices. The [[Theravada]] school, while remaining relatively conservative, still developed new ideas on meditation and yogic phenomenology in their later works, the most influential of which is the [[Visuddhimagga]]. The Indic meditation teachings of [[Mahayana|Mahayana Buddhism]] can be seen in influential texts like the [[Yogacarabhumi-sastra|''Yog\u0101c\u0101rabh\u016bmi-\u015a\u0101stra'']] (compiled c. 4th century). Mahayana meditation practices also developed and adopted new yogic methods, such as the use of [[mantra]] and [[dharani]], [[Pure Land Buddhism|pure land practices]] which aimed at rebirth in a [[Pure land|pure land or buddhafield]], and visualization methods. Chinese Buddhism developed its own methods, such as the Chan practice of [[K\u014dan|Koan]] introspection and [[Hua Tou]]. Likewise, [[Vajrayana|Tantric Buddhism]] (also Mantrayana, Vajrayana) developed and adopted tantric methods, which remain the basis of the Tibetan Buddhist yogic systems, including the [[Six Dharmas of Naropa|Six yogas of Naropa]], [[Kalacakra Tantra|Kalacakra]], [[Mahamudra]] and [[Dzogchen]].<ref>Feuerstein (2002), pp. 230-241.</ref>\n\n=== Jain yoga ===\n{{Main|Jain meditation}}\n\nJain yoga has been a central practice in [[Jainism]]. Jain spirituality is based on a strict code of nonviolence or [[ahimsa]] (which includes [[vegetarianism]]), almsgiving (dana), right faith in the [[Ratnatraya|three jewels]], the practice of austerities (''tapas'') such as [[Fasting in Jainism|fasting]], and yogic practices.<ref name=\"Ratna traya\">{{cite book|title=Jain Yog|last=Mahapragya|first=Acharya|publisher=Aadarsh Saahitya Sangh|year=2004|chapter=Foreword}}</ref><ref>Feuerstein (2002), pp. 187, 198.</ref> Jain yoga aims at the liberation and purification of the self (atma) or soul (jiva) from the forces of [[Karma in Jainism|karma]], which keep all souls bound to the cycle of transmigration.

Later works include [[Kundakunda|Kundakunda's]] ''V\u0101rassa-a\u1e47uvekkh\u0101'' (\u201cTwelve Contemplations\u201d, c. 1st century BCE to 1st century CE), [[Haribhadra]]'s [[Yogad\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6disamuccaya|''Yogad\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6disamuccya'']] (8th century)  and the [[Yoga\u015b\u0101stra]] of [[Hemachandra]] (12th century). Later forms of Jain yoga adopted Hindu influences, such as ideas from Patanjali's yoga and later Tantric yoga (in the works of Haribhadra and Hemachandra respectively). The Jains also developed a progressive path to liberation through yogic praxis, outlining several levels of virtue called [[Gunasthana|''gunasthanas'']].\n\nIn the modern era, new forms of Jain meditation have also been developed. One of the most influential ones is the ''prek\u1e63\u0101'' system of \u0100c\u0101rya [[Mah\u0101praj\u00f1a]] which is eclectic and includes the use of mantra, breath control, mudras, bandhas, and so on.\n\n=== Yoga in Advaita Vedanta ===\n[[File:Raja Ravi Varma - Sankaracharya.jpg|thumb|upright|''[[Adi Shankara]] with Disciples'', by [[Raja Ravi Varma]] (1904).

It was first [[Scientific description|described]] by British zoologist [[Oldfield Thomas]] in 1910, who procured four specimens from [[Nha Trang]] in [[Annam (French protectorate)|Annam]]. Sighted only thrice in the wild, little is known about the distribution and ecology of this mouse-deer. After 1910, the Vietnam mouse-deer was reported +next in 1990 near Dak Rong and Buon Luoi in the [[Gia Lai Province]]. With increasing hunting pressure, habitat loss due to deforestation and no more reports of the species in the wild, the mouse-deer was feared to have gone extinct. The [[IUCN]] listed the species as [[Data Deficient]] in 2008. In 2019, a study confirmed the existence of the Vietnam mouse-deer in dry low-lying forests of southern Vietnam with [[camera trap]] evidence. This mouse-deer is characterised by a rough coat with a strange double-tone coloration unseen in other chevrotains; the front part of the body is reddish brown and contrasts strongly with the greyish posterior. It has big reddish brown ears, white and dark reddish brown marks on the throat.\n\n==Taxonomy==\nThe Vietnam mouse-deer was first [[Scientific description|described]] by British zoologist [[Oldfield Thomas]] in 1910 by the [[Binomial nomenclature|name]] ''Tragulus versicolor''.<ref name=thomas>{{cite journal |last=Thomas |first=Oldfield |authorlink=Oldfield Thomas|year=1910 |journal=The Annals and Magazine of Natural History |series=8 |volume=5 |page=535 |issue=25\u201330 |title=''Tragulus versicolor'' |url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/54587#page/571/mode/1up}}</ref><ref name=msw3>{{MSW3|page=650|id=14200183}}</ref> In the past this mouse-deer was generally treated as a [[subspecies]] of the [[greater mouse-deer]] (''T.&nbsp;napu''), though it more closely resembles the [[lesser mouse-deer]] (''T.&nbsp;kanchil'').

It was first [[Scientific description|described]] by British zoologist [[Oldfield Thomas]] in 1910, who procured four specimens from [[Nha Trang]] in [[Annam (French protectorate)|Annam]]. Sighted only thrice in the wild, little is known about the distribution and ecology of this mouse-deer. After 1910, the Vietnam mouse-deer was reported +next in 1990 near Dak Rong and Buon Luoi in the [[Gia Lai Province]]. With increasing hunting pressure, habitat loss due to deforestation and no more reports of the species in the wild, the mouse-deer was feared to have gone extinct. The [[IUCN]] listed the species as [[Data Deficient]] in 2008. In 2019, a study confirmed the existence of the Vietnam mouse-deer in dry low-lying forests of southern Vietnam with [[camera trap]] evidence. This mouse-deer is characterised by a rough coat with a strange double-tone coloration unseen in other chevrotains; the front part of the body is reddish brown and contrasts strongly with the greyish posterior. It has big reddish brown ears, white and dark reddish brown marks on the throat.\n\n==Taxonomy==\nIn 1910, British zoologist [[Oldfield Thomas]] [[Scientific description|described]] four chevrotains from [[Nha Trang]] in [[Annam (French protectorate)|Annam]] (southern Vietnam), giving them the name ''Tragulus versicolor''.<ref name=thomas>{{cite journal |last=Thomas |first=Oldfield |authorlink=Oldfield Thomas|year=1910 |journal=The Annals and Magazine of Natural History |series=8 |volume=5 |page=535 |issue=25\u201330 |title=''Tragulus versicolor'' |url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/54587#page/571/mode/1up}}</ref><ref name=msw3>{{MSW3|page=650|id=14200183}}</ref> In the past this mouse-deer was generally treated as a [[subspecies]] of the [[greater mouse-deer]] (''T.&nbsp;napu''), though it more closely resembles the [[lesser mouse-deer]] (''T.&nbsp;kanchil''). In a taxonomic revision in 2004, the Vietnam mouse-deer was identified as an independent species in ''Tragulus''.<ref>{{cite journal |first1=Erik |last1=Meijaard |first2=C.P. |last2=Groves |year=2004 |url=http://zmmu.msu.ru/rjt/articles/ther3_1%2009_13%20Kuznez_Borisenko.pdf |title=A taxonomic revision of the ''Tragulus'' mouse-deer (Artiodactyla) |journal=Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society |volume=140 |issue=1 |pages=63\u2013102 |doi=10.1111/j.1096-3642.2004.00091.x}}</ref>\n\n==Status and sightings==\nInformation on the distribution and ecology of the mouse-deer is scarce; it is [[endemic]] to Vietnam. The specimens obtained by Thomas were from Nha Trang ({{Coord|12|15|N|109|10|E}}) in Annam on the southern coast of Vietnam; this need not be the original location for the species, as the specimens could have been traded.<ref name=iucn/> The mouse-deer was not seen in the wild for another 80 years until a Vietnamese-Russian expedition procured an adult male specimen from local hunters near Dak Rong and Buon Luoi in the [[Gia Lai Province]]. This specimen, initially assumed to be a [[Java mouse-deer]] (''T. javanicus''), was deposited in the [[Zoological Museum of Moscow University]].

Pothen|Pratap Pothen]]) - is a girl who always listens to her heart. Vijay was asked to marry Pavitra by her dad and Pavitra is testing whether Vijay is the right guy for her. Driving his way home from spending a day with Pavitra, Vijay hits Merin ([[Nanditha Raj|Nanditha]]), a nurse who has just arrived from India to work in London. Her wrist gets paralysed after the accident. Vijay takes care of her and eventually falls in love with Merin and vice versa. Pavitra's dad and Francis ([[Mukesh (actor)|Mukesh]]) fixes Vijay and Pavitra's marriage. But when he refuses to marry her, Francis forces him to marry Pavitra because of her wealth. Merin's job agreement gets terminated because they think that she is physically unfit. Francis tries to help her but he fails. Eventually, Francis forces Vijay to not give her false hopes and gift her a sum of money and let her go back to India. Merin refuses the amount of money gifted and asks him to show her around London before she leaves. Then Merin goes back to India. The next day, her aunt Gracy ([[Lena (actress)|Lena]]) calls Vijay to tell that Merin has not reached her home yet. Gracy's husband Thai Kutty ([[Sunil Sukhada|Sunil]]), tells them that he will go to India to enquire about Merin but Vijay says that he will go instead because he is the one who is supposed to go. Francis tries to force him to stay, but Vijay says that he really likes Merin and he will go to India, no matter what. Pavitra helps him to go to India by convincing her dad to not stop him and personally dropping him at the airport. Vijay reaches India. While in a taxi, Francis calls Vijay and directs him to go to Merin's home. Vijay reaches Merin's home to find her house being seized to debt. He finds out that Merin has reached home safely. The movie ends by Pavitra revealing to Vijay that Merin had reached home safely, but lied to make Vijay realize his love for her.\n\n==Cast==\n\n* [[Prithviraj Sukumaran]] as Vijay Kannedathu Das\n* [[Andrea Jeremiah]] as Pavithra\n* [[Nanditha Raj]] as Merin Elsa John\n* [[Pratap Pothen]] as C.
