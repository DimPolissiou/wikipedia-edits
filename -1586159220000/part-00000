In the 17th century, it occasionally served as the winter headquarters for the [[Grand Vizier]] of the Turks during their wars with [[Russia]].{{sfnp|''EB''|1878}} The town's location near to the [[Black Sea]] made it a target for the Russian navy, the town was bombed by the Russians in 1854 during the [[Crimean War]].{{sfnp|''EB''|1878}} In the mid-19th century, Babadag formed part of the [[sanjak|region]] (''sanjak'') of [[Sanjak of Silistra|Silistra]] within the \"Bulgarian Government\" ([[Danube Vilayet]]).{{sfnp|''EB''|1878}} Following the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877\u20131878)|1877\u20131878 war]] between the Ottoman and Russian empires, Babadag became part of independent Romania.\n\nAt Babadag, the [[Romanian Land Forces|Romanian Army]] operates a military training facility.  With a total surface area of 270&nbsp;km\u00b2, this is one of the largest and most modern training [[firing range]]s in [[Europe]]. US forces have started to train at Babadag as part of Romania's integration into NATO.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.mediafaxfoto.ro/preview.php?id=3011141 |title=MEDIAFAX Foto<!-- Bot generated title --> |access-date=2008-07-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080718020844/http://www.mediafaxfoto.ro/preview.php?id=3011141 |archive-date=2008-07-18 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==Demographics==\n{{Historical populations\n|source = Census data\n|1912 |4686\n|1930 |4626\n|1948 |4022\n|1956 |5549\n|1966 |7343\n|1977 |8564\n|1992 |10437\n|2002 |10878\n|2011 |8940\n}}\n\nIn 1900 Babadag population was 3,500.{{sfnp|''EB''|1911}} The 2011 census counted 8,940 inhabitants.\n\nPopulation distribution:\n*6,267 [[Romanians]] (77.64%)\n*420 [[Turkish people|Turks]] (5.2%)\n*1248 [[Romani people|Roma]] (15.46%)\n*37 [[Lipovans]] (0.45%)\n*98 Others\n84.8% were [[Romanian Orthodox Church|Romanian Orthodox]] and 14.2% [[Islam|Muslim]].\n\n==Economy==\nBefore the [[First World War]], Babadag served as the market for [[wool]] and [[Lamb (food)|mutton]] from the [[Dobruja]].{{sfnp|''EB''|1911}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n* {{cite EB9 |mode=cs2 |wstitle=Babatag  |ref={{harvid|''EB''|1878}} |volume=3 |page=178 }}.\n* {{cite EB1911 |mode=cs2 |wstitle=Babadag |ref={{harvid|''EB''|1911}} |volume=3 |page=91 }}.\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|Babadag}}\n* [http://www.babadag.ro Official Site]\n\n{{Tulcea County}}\n\n[[Category:Towns in Romania]]\n[[Category:Populated places in Tulcea County]]\n[[Category:Place names of Turkish origin in Romania]]\n", "name_user": "Markussep", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babadag"}

A Wuhan hospital notified the local center for disease control and prevention (CDC) and health commissions on 27 December 2019. On 31 December Wuhan CDC admitted that there was a cluster of unknown pneumonia cases related to [[Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market|Huanan Seafood Market]] after the unverified documents appeared on the Internet. The potential disease outbreak soon drew nationwide attention including that of the [[National Health Commission]] (NHC) in Beijing who sent experts to Wuhan on the following day.

{"title_page": "Ti plasmid", "text_new": "[[File:Ti plasmid.svg|thumb|350px|right|alt=A diagram showing the structure of the Ti plasmid, with various important regions labeled|The structure of the Ti plasmid]]\n\nA '''tumour inducing (Ti)''' [[plasmid]] is a plasmid found in pathogenic species of ''[[Agrobacterium]]'', including [[Agrobacterium tumefaciens|''A. tumefaciens]], [[Rhizobium rhizogenes|''A. rhizogenes'']], ''A. rubi'' and [[Allorhizobium vitis|''A. vitis'']]. \n\nEvolutionarily, the Ti plasmid is part of a family of plasmids carried by many species of [[Alphaproteobacteria]]. Members of this plasmid family are defined by the presence of a conserved DNA region known as the ''repABC'' gene cassette, which mediates the [[DNA replication|replication]] of the plasmid, the partitioning of the plasmid into daughter cells during [[cell division]] as well as the maintenance of the plasmid at low copy numbers in a cell<ref name=\"Gordon2014\">{{cite journal |author=Gordon, J. E., Christie, P. J. |title=The ''Agrobacterium'' Ti Plasmids |journal=Microbiology Spectrum |date=2014 |volume=2 |issue=6 |doi=10.1128/microbiolspec.PLAS-0010-2013}}</ref>. The Ti plasmids themselves are sorted into different categories based on the type of molecule, or [[opine]], they allow the bacteria to break down as an energy source<ref name=\"Hooykaas1994\">{{cite journal |author=Hooykaas, P. J. & Beijersbergen, A. G. |title=The virulence system of ''Agrobacterium tumefaciens'' |journal=Annual review of phytopathology |date=1994 |volume=32 |issue=1 |pages=157\u2013181 |doi=10.1146/annurev.py.32.090194.001105}}</ref>. \n\nThe presence of this Ti plasmid is essential for the bacteria to cause crown gall disease in plants<ref name=\"Gordon2014\" />. This is facilitated via certain crucial regions in the Ti plasmid, including the ''vir'' region, which encodes for virulence genes, and the [[transfer DNA]] (T-DNA) region, which is a section of the Ti plasmid that is [[horizontal gene transfer|transferred]] via [[bacterial conjugation |conjugation]] into host plant cells after an injury site is sensed by the bacteria. These regions have features that allow the delivery of T-DNA into host plant cells, and can modify the host plant cell to cause the synthesis of molecules like [[plant hormones]] (e.g. [[auxins]], [[cytokinins]]) and opines and the formation of crown gall tumours<ref name=\"Gordon2014\" />.\n\nBecause the T-DNA region of the Ti plasmid can be transferred from bacteria to plant cells, it represented an exciting avenue for the transfer of DNA between [[kingdom (biology)|kingdoms]] and spurred large amounts of research on the Ti plasmid and its possible uses in bioengineering.  \n\n==Nomenclature and classification==\nThe Ti plasmid is a member of a plasmid family found in Alphaproteobacteria<ref name=\"Pinto2012\">{{cite journal |author=Pinto, U. M., Pappas, K. M., Winans, S. C., |title=The ABCs of plasmid replication and segregation |journal=Nature Reviews Microbiology |date=2012 |volume=10 |issue=11 |pages=755-765 |doi=10.1038/nrmicro2882}}</ref>. These plasmids are often relatively large in size, ranging from 100kbp to 2Mbp. They are also often termed [[replicon (genetics)|replicons]], as their replication begins at a single site. Members of this family have a characteristic ''repABC'' gene cassette<ref name=\"Cevallos2008\">{{cite journal |author=Cevallos, M. A., Cervantes-Rivera, R. & Guti\u00e9rrez-R\u00edos, R. M. |title=The repABC plasmid family |journal=Plasmid |date=2008 |volume=60 |issue=1 |pages=19-37 |doi=10.1016/j.plasmid.2008.03.001}}</ref>. Another notable member of this family is the root inducing (Ri) plasmid carried by ''A. rhizogenes'', which causes another plant disease known as hairy root disease<ref name=\"Gordon2014\" />.\n\nA key feature of Ti plasmids is their ability to drive the production of opines, which are derivatives of various [[amino acids]] or [[sugar phosphates]], in host plant cells. These opines can then be used as a nutrient for the infecting bacteria, which [[catabolism|catabolizes]] the respective opines using genes encoded in the Ti plasmid. \n\nAccordingly, Ti plasmids have been classified based on the type of opine they catabolize, namely: [[nopaline|nopaline-]], [[octopine|octopine-]] or mannityl-types, which are amino acid derivatives, or agrocinopine-type, which are sugar phosphate derivatives<ref name=\"Gordon2014\" />.\n\n==Historical discovery==\nThe identification of ''A. tumefaciens'' as the cause of gall tumours in plants paved the way for insights into the molecular basis of crown gall disease<ref name=\"Kado\">{{cite journal |author=Kado, C. I. |title=Historical account on gaining insights on the mechanism of crown gall tumorigenesis induced by ''Agrobacterium tumefaciens'' |journal=Frontiers in Microbiology |date=2014 |volume=5 |issue=340 |doi=10.3389/fmicb.2014.00340}}</ref>.\n\nThe first indication of a genetic effect on host plant cells came in 1942-1943, where plant cells of secondary tumours were found to lack any bacterial cells within. However, these tumour cells did possess the ability to produce opines metabolized by the infecting bacterial strain<ref>{{cite journal |author=Petit, A., Delhaye, S., Temp\u00e9, J. & Morel, G. |title=Recherches sur les guanidines des tissues de Crown gall.

V\u00e9g. |date=1970 |volume=8 |page=205-213 }}</ref>. Crucially, the production of the respective opines occurred regardless of the plant species and occasionally only within crown gall tissues, indicating that the bacteria had transferred some genetic material to the host plant cells in order to allow opine synthesis<ref name=\"Kado\" />.\n\nHowever, how and to what extend did DNA transfer occur remained an open question. Adding ''A. tumefaciens'' DNA alone did not cause tumors in plants<ref>{{cite journal |author=Kado, C. I. & Lurquin, P. F. |title=Studies on ''Agrobacterium tumefaciens''. V.

The addition of [[deoxyribonucleases]] (DNases) to degrade DNA also failed to prevent the formation and growth of the plant tumors<ref>{{cite journal |author=Braun, A. C. & Wood, H. N. |title=On the inhibition of tumor inception in the crown-gall disease with the use of ribonuclease A. |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |date=1966 |volume=56 |issue=5 |pages=1417\u20131422 |doi=10.1073/pnas.56.5.1417}}</ref>. These suggested that little, if any, of the ''A. tumefaciens'' DNA is transferred to the host plant cell to cause disease and, if DNA is indeed transferred from the bacteria to the plant, it must occur in a protected manner.\n\nSubsequently, [[oncogenic]] bacterial strains were found to be able to convert non-pathogenic bacteria into pathogens via the process of conjugation, where the genes responsible for virulence were transferred to the non-pathogenic cells<ref>{{cite journal |author=Kerr, A. |title=Acquisition of virulence by non-pathogenic isolates of ''Agrobacterium radiobacter''. |journal=Physiological Plant Pathology |date=1971 |volume=1 |issue=3 |pages=241-246 |doi=10.1016/0048-4059(71)90045-2}}</ref>. The role of a plasmid in this pathogenic ability was further supported when large plasmids were found only in pathogenic bacteria but not avirulent bacteria<ref>{{cite journal |author=Zaenen, I., van Larebeke, N., Teuchy, H., van Montagu, M. & Schell, J. |title=Supercoiled circular DNA in crown-gall inducing ''Agrobacterium'' strains |journal=Journal of Molecular Biology |date=1974 |volume=86 |issue=1 |pages=109\u2013127 |doi=10.1016/s0022-2836(74)80011-2}}</ref>. Eventually, the detection of parts of bacterial plasmids in host plant cells was established, confirming that this was the genetic material responsible for the genetic effect of infection<ref>{{cite journal |author=Chilton, M. D., Drummond, M. H., Merlo, D. J., Sciaky, D., Montoya, A. L., Gordon, M. P. & Nester, E.

Some notable early milestones in the studies of Ti plasmids include the mapping of a Ti plasmid in 1978 and the studying of sequence similarity between different Ti plasmids in 1981<ref>{{cite journal |author=Chilton, M.

Studies into the T-DNA region determined their process of transfer and identified genes allowing the synthesis of plant hormones and opines <ref>{{cite journal |author=Zambryski, P., Tempe, J. & Schell, J. |title=Transfer and function of T-DNA genes from ''Agrobacterium'' Ti and Ri plasmids in plants |journal=Cell |date=1989 |volume=56 |issue=2 |pages=193\u2013201 |doi=10.1016/0092-8674(89)90892-1}}</ref>. Separately, early work aimed to determine the functions of the genes encoded in the 'vir' region - these were broadly categorized into those that allowed bacterial-host interactions and those that enabled T-DNA delivery<ref name=\"Hooykaas1994\" />.\n\n==Replication, partitioning and maintenance==\n[[File:RepABC gene cassette of Ti plasmids.png|thumb|center|upright=1.5|alt=A schematic of the ''repABC'' gene cassette, along with the activity of their gene products|The ''repABC gene'' cassette of Ti plasmids in Agrobacteria, with a schematic of their gene product and activities]]\n\nThe replication, partitioning and maintenance of the Ti plasmid depends on the ''repABC'' gene cassette, which is mainly made up of three genes: ''repA'', ''repB'' and ''repC''. ''repA'' and ''repB'' each encode for proteins involved in plasmid partitioning, while ''repC'' encodes a replication initiator<ref name=\"Gordon2014\" />. These genes are expressed from 4 different promoters located upstream of ''repA''. ''repE'' encodes for a small [[antisense RNA]] and is located between ''repB'' and ''repC''<ref name=\"Cevallos2008\" />. Additionally, there is a partitioning site (''parS'') and an [[origin of replication]] (''oriV'') present within the ''repABC'' cassette<ref name=\"Gordon2014\" />. \n\n===Replication of the Ti plasmid===\nThe replication of the Ti plasmid is driven by the RepC initiator protein, which possesses two [[protein domains]]: an [[N-terminal]] domain (NTD) that binds to DNA and a [[C-terminal]] domain (CTD). Mutational analyses have shown that without a functional RepC protein, the Ti plasmid is unable to replicate<ref name=\"Cevallos2008\" />. Meanwhile, the ''oriV'' sequence is around 150 nucleotides in length and is found within the ''repC'' gene<ref name=\"Pinto2012\" />. Laboratory experiments have shown that the RepC protein binds to this region, suggesting its role as the origin of replication<ref name=\"Pinto2011\">{{cite journal |author=Pinto, U. M., Flores-Mireles, A. L., Costa, E. D. & Winans, S. C |title=RepC protein of the octopine-type Ti plasmid binds to the probable origin of replication within repC and functions only in cis|date=2011 |volume=81 |issue=6 |pages=1593-1606 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2958.2011.07789.x}}</ref>. Therefore, while the complete process behind the replication of the Ti plasmid has not been fully described, the initial step of replication would likely depend on the expression of RepC and its binding to ''oriV''. Of note, the RepC protein only acts in ''cis'', where it only drives the replication of the plasmid it is encoded in and not any other plasmid also present in the bacterial cell<ref name=\"Pinto2011\" />.\n\n===Partitioning of the Ti plasmid===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ style=\"text-align:left;\" | Components involved in the RepA/RepB partitioning system of Ti plasmids<ref name=\"Gordon2014\" />\n|- \n!

M. |title=The bacterial ParA-ParB partitioning proteins |date=2001 |volume=91 |issue=1 |pages=1-34 |doi=10.1016/S0168-1656(01)00293-0}}</ref>. Mutations in either of the proteins RepA or RepB have resulted in a decrease in plasmid stability, indicating their role and importance in plasmid partitioning<ref name=\"Cevallos2008\" />.  The ability of RepA to form filaments allows it to create a physical bridge along which DNA can be pulled to opposite poles of a dividing cell. Meanwhile, the RepB protein can bind specifically to the ''parS'' sequence, forming a complex with DNA that can be recognized by RepA<ref name=\"Gordon2014\" /><ref name=\"Cevallos2008\" />. This system is particularly important for the proper partitioning of the Ti plasmid, as the plasmid is only present in few copy numbers in the bacterial cell.\n\n===Maintenance of the Ti plasmid===\nThe Ti plasmid is maintained at low copy numbers within a bacterial cell. This is partly achieved by influencing the expression of the replication initiator RepC<ref name=\"Gordon2014\" />. When bound to [[Adenosine diphosphate|ADP]], RepA is activated to work with RepB, acting as a negative [[regulation of gene expression|regulator]] of the ''repABC'' cassette<ref name=\"Pinto2012\" />. The levels of RepC is therefore kept low within a cell, preventing too many rounds of replication from occurring during each cell division cycle. Furthermore, there is a small RNA known as RepE encoded between ''repB'' and ''repC'' that lowers the expression of ''repC''<ref name=\"Chai2005\">{{cite journal |author=Chai, Y. & Winans, S. C. |title=A small antisense RNA downregulates expression of an essential replicase protein of an ''Agrobacterium tumefaciens'' Ti plasmid |journal=Molecular microbiology |date=2005 |volume=56 |issue=6 |pages=1574-1585 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2958.2005.04636.x}}</ref>. RepE is [[complementarity (molecular biology)|complementary]] to RepC and will bind with the ''repC'' [[messenger RNA|mRNA]] to form a double-stranded molecule. This can then block the [[translation (biology)|translational]] production of the RepC protein<ref name=\"Chai2005\" />.\n\nSeparately, the expression of the ''repABC'' cassette and hence the copy number of the Ti plasmid is also influenced via a [[quorum sensing]] system in ''Agrobacterium''<ref name=\"Cevallos2008\" />. Quorum sensing systems respond to bacterial population densities by sensing a molecule, known as an autoinducer, that is produced by the bacterial cells at low levels and would build up to a threshold level when there is a high density of bacteria present<ref>{{cite journal |author=Miller, M. B. & Bassler, B. L. |title=Quorum sensing in bacteria |journal=Annual Reviews in Microbiology |date=2001 |volume=55 |issue=1 |pages=165-199 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2958.2005.04636.x}}</ref>. In this case, the autoinducer is the N-3-oxooctanoyl-L-homoserine lactone (3-O-C<sub>8</sub>-AHL) molecule, which is sensed by a regulator known as TraR<ref name=\"Cevallos2008\" />. When activated, TraR will bind to regions known as ''tra'' boxes in the ''repABC'' gene cassette's promoter regions to drive expression.

This is facilitated via certain crucial regions in the Ti plasmid, including the ''vir'' region, which encodes for virulence genes, and the [[transfer DNA]] (T-DNA) region, which is a section of the Ti plasmid that is [[horizontal gene transfer|transferred]] via [[bacterial conjugation |conjugation]] into host plant cells after an injury site is sensed by the bacteria. These regions have features that allow the delivery of T-DNA into host plant cells, and can modify the host plant cell to cause the synthesis of molecules like [[plant hormones]] (e.g. [[auxins]], [[cytokinins]]) and opines and the formation of crown gall tumours<ref name=\"Gordon2014\" />.\n\nBecause the T-DNA region of the Ti plasmid can be transferred from bacteria to plant cells, it represented an exciting avenue for the transfer of DNA between [[kingdom (biology)|kingdoms]] and spurred large amounts of research on the Ti plasmid and its possible uses in bioengineering.  \n\n==Nomenclature and classification==\nThe Ti plasmid is a member of a plasmid family found in Alphaproteobacteria<ref name=\"Pinto2012\">{{cite journal |author=Pinto, U.

Another notable member of this family is the root inducing (Ri) plasmid carried by ''A. rhizogenes'', which causes another plant disease known as hairy root disease<ref name=\"Gordon2014\" />.\n\nA key feature of Ti plasmids is their ability to drive the production of opines, which are derivatives of various [[amino acids]] or [[sugar phosphates]], in host plant cells. These opines can then be used as an nutrient for the infecting bacteria, which [[catabolism|catabolizes]] the respective opines using genes encoded in the Ti plasmid. \n\nAccordingly, Ti plasmids have been classified based on the type of opine they catabolize, namely: [[nopaline|nopaline-]], [[octopine|octopine-]] or mannityl-types, which are amino acid derivatives, or agrocinopine-type, which are sugar phosphate derivatives<ref name=\"Gordon2014\" />.\n\n==Historical discovery==\nThe identification of ''A. tumefaciens'' as the cause of gall tumours in plants paved the way for insights into the molecular basis of crown gall disease<ref name=\"Kado\">{{cite journal |author=Kado, C.

These suggested that little, if any, of the ''A. tumefaciens'' DNA is transferred to the host plant cell to cause disease and, if DNA is indeed transferred from the bacteria to the plant, it must occur in a protected manner.\n\nSubsequently, [[oncogenic]] bacterial strains were found to be able to convert non-pathogenic bacteria into pathogens via the process of conjugation, where the genes responsible for virulence were transferred to the non-pathogenic cells<ref>{{cite journal |author=Kerr, A. |title=Acquisition of virulence by non-pathogenic isolates of ''Agrobacterium radiobacter''. |journal=Physiological Plant Pathology |date=1971 |volume=1 |issue=3 |pages=241-246 |doi=10.1016/0048-4059(71)90045-2}}</ref>.

Separately, early work aimed to determine the functions of the genes encoded in the 'vir' region - these were broadly categorized into those that allowed bacterial-host interactions and those that enabled T-DNA delivery<ref name=\"Hooykaas1994\" />.\n\n==Replication, partitioning and maintenance==\n[[File:RepABC gene cassette of Ti plasmids.png|thumb|center|upright=1.5|alt=A schematic of the ''repABC'' gene cassette, along with the activity of their gene products|The ''repABC gene'' cassette of Ti plasmids in Agrobacteria, with a schematic of their gene product and activities]]\n\nThe replication, partitioning and maintenance of the Ti plasmid depends on the ''repABC'' gene cassette, which is mainly made up of three genes: ''repA'', ''repB'' and ''repC''. ''repA'' and ''repB'' each encode for proteins involved in plasmid partitioning, while ''repC'' encodes a replication initiator<ref name=\"Gordon2014\" />. These genes are expressed from 4 different promoters located upstream of ''repA''. ''repE'' encodes for a small [[antisense RNA]] and is located between ''repB'' and ''repC''<ref name=\"Cevallos2008\" />. Additionally, there is a partitioning site (''parS'') and an [[origin of replication]] (''oriV'') present within the ''repABC'' cassette<ref name=\"Gordon2014\" />. \n\n===Replication of the Ti plasmid===\nThe replication of the Ti plasmid is driven by the RepC initiator protein, which possesses two [[protein domains]]: an [[N-terminal]] domain (NTD) that binds to DNA and a [[C-terminal]] domain (CTD). Mutational analyses have shown that without a functional RepC protein, the Ti plasmid is unable to replicate<ref name=\"Cevallos2008\" />. Meanwhile, the ''oriV'' sequence is around 150 nucleotides in length and is found within the ''repC'' gene<ref name=\"Pinto2012\" />. Laboratory experiments have shown that the RepC protein binds to this region, suggesting its role as the origin of replication<ref name=\"Pinto2011\">{{cite journal |author=Pinto, U. M., Flores-Mireles, A. L., Costa, E. D. & Winans, S. C |title=RepC protein of the octopine-type Ti plasmid binds to the probable origin of replication within repC and functions only in cis|date=2011 |volume=81 |issue=6 |pages=1593-1606 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2958.2011.07789.x}}</ref>. Therefore, while the complete process behind the replication of the Ti plasmid has not been fully described, the initial step of replication would likely depend on the expression of RepC and its binding to ''oriV''. Of note, the RepC protein only acts in ''cis'', where it only drives the replication of the plasmid it is encoded in and not any other plasmid also present in the bacterial cell<ref name=\"Pinto2011\" />.\n\n===Partitioning of the Ti plasmid===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ style=\"text-align:left;\" | Components involved in the RepA/RepB partitioning system of Ti plasmids<ref name=\"Gordon2014\" />\n|- \n!

M. |title=The bacterial ParA-ParB partitioning proteins |date=2001 |volume=91 |issue=1 |pages=1-34 |doi=10.1016/S0168-1656(01)00293-0}}</ref>. Mutations in either of the proteins RepA or RepB have resulted in a decrease in plasmid stability, indicating their role and importance in plasmid partitioning<ref name=\"Cevallos2008\" />.  The ability of RepA to form filaments allows it to create a physical bridge along which DNA can be pulled to opposite poles of a dividing cell. Meanwhile, the RepB protein can bind specifically to the ''parS'' sequence, forming a complex with DNA that can be recognized by RepA<ref name=\"Gordon2014\" /><ref name=\"Cevallos2008\" />. This system is particularly important for the proper partitioning of the Ti plasmid, as the plasmid is only present in few copy numbers in the bacterial cell.\n\n===Maintenance of the Ti plasmid===\nThe Ti plasmid is maintained at low copy numbers within a bacterial cell. This is partly achieved by influencing the expression of the replication initiator RepC<ref name=\"Gordon2014\" />. When bound to [[Adenosine diphosphate|ADP]], RepA is activated to work with RepB, acting as a negative [[regulation of gene expression|regulator]] of the ''repABC'' cassette<ref name=\"Pinto2012\" />. The levels of RepC is therefore kept low within a cell, preventing too many rounds of replication from occurring during each cell division cycle. Furthermore, there is a small RNA known as RepE encoded between ''repB'' and ''repC'' that lowers the expression of ''repC''<ref name=\"Chai2005\">{{cite journal |author=Chai, Y. & Winans, S. C. |title=A small antisense RNA downregulates expression of an essential replicase protein of an ''Agrobacterium tumefaciens'' Ti plasmid |journal=Molecular microbiology |date=2005 |volume=56 |issue=6 |pages=1574-1585 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2958.2005.04636.x}}</ref>. RepE is [[complementarity (molecular biology)|complementary]] to RepC and will bind with the ''repC'' [[messenger RNA|mRNA]] to form a double-stranded molecule. This can then block the [[translation (biology)|translational]] production of the RepC protein<ref name=\"Chai2005\" />.\n\nSeparately, the expression of the ''repABC'' cassette and hence the copy number of the Ti plasmid is also influenced via a [[quorum sensing]] system in ''Agrobacterium''<ref name=\"Cevallos2008\" />. Quorum sensing systems respond to bacterial population densities by sensing a molecule, known as an autoinducer, that is produced by the bacterial cells at low levels and would build up to a threshold level when there is a high density of bacteria present<ref>{{cite journal |author=Miller, M. B. & Bassler, B. L. |title=Quorum sensing in bacteria |journal=Annual Reviews in Microbiology |date=2001 |volume=55 |issue=1 |pages=165-199 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2958.2005.04636.x}}</ref>. In this case, the autoinducer is the N-3-oxooctanoyl-L-homoserine lactone (3-O-C<sub>8</sub>-AHL) molecule, which is sensed by a regulator known as TraR<ref name=\"Cevallos2008\" />. When activated, TraR will bind to regions known as ''tra'' boxes in the ''repABC'' gene cassette's promoter regions to drive expression. Therefore, a high level of population density increases the number of plasmids present within each bacterial cell, likely to support pathogenesis in the plant host<ref name=\"Cevallos2008\" />.\n\n==Features==\n===Virulence operon===\n[[File:Vir region of Ti plasmids.png|thumb|center|upright=2.0|alt=A diagram showing the composition of the ''vir'' region of Ti plasmids|The composition of the ''vir'' region of octopine-type Ti plasmids]]\n\nThe expression of the ''vir'' region is usually repressed under normal conditions, and only becomes activated when the bacteria senses plant-derived signals from wound sites. This activation is necessary for the production of Vir proteins and the transfer of DNA and proteins into host plant cells<ref name=\"Gordon2014\" />. \n\nVirA and VirG form a [[two-component regulatory system]] within ''Agrobacterium''<ref name=\"Winans1991\">{{cite journal |authors=Winans, S.

This is a type of sensing and signalling system found commonly in bacteria; in this case, they act to sense plant-derived signals to drive the expression of the ''vir'' region. During the sensing, VirA, a histidine sensor kinase, will become [[phosphorylation|phosphorylated]] before passing on this phosphate group to the response regulator VirG<ref>{{cite journal |authors=Huang, Y., Morel, P., Powell, B & Kado, C.

This process utilizes preexisting gaps in the host plant cell's genome to allow the T-DNA to pair with short sequences in the genome, priming the process of [[ligation (molecular biology)|DNA ligation]], where the T-DNA is permanently joint to the plant genome<ref name=\"Galvin2012\" />. The T-DNA region is flanked at both ends by 24bp sequences. \n\nWithin the host plant cell's genome, the T-DNA of ''Agrobacterium'' is expressed to produced two main groups of proteins<ref name=\"Gordon2014\" />. One group is responsible for the production of plant growth hormones. As these hormones are produced, there will be an increase in the rate of cell division and therefore the formation of crown gall tumors<ref name=\"Zhu2000\" />. The second group of proteins are responsible for driving the synthesis of opines in the host plant cells. The specific opines produced depends on the type of the Ti plasmid but not on the plant host. These opines cannot be utilized by the plant host, and will instead be exported out of the plant cell where it can be taken up by the ''Agrobacterium'' cells. The bacteria possess genes in other regions of the Ti plasmid that allows the catabolism of opines<ref name=\"Gordon2014\" />.\n\n===Transfer apparatus===\nTransfer apparatuses encoded within the Ti plasmid have to achieve two objectives: allow the conjugative transfer of the Ti plasmid between bacteria and allow the delivery of the T-DNA and certain effector proteins into host plant cells. These are achieved by the Tra/Trb system and the VirB/VirD4 system respectively, which are members of the [[bacterial secretion system|type IV secretion system]] (T4SS)<ref name=\"Zhu2000\">{{cite journal |authors=Zhu, J., Oger, P.

Together, these proteins will recognize and bind to a region known as the [[origin of transfer]] (''oriT'') in the Ti plasmid to form the relaxosome complex.
