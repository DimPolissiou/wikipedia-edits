Sebastiani and Fr. Hyacinth. Fr. Sebastiani arrived first in 1655 and began to speak directly with the metropolitan, Mar Thoma I. Fr. Sebastiani, with the help of Portuguese, gained the support of many, especially with the support of [[Palliveettil Mar Chandy|Palliveettil Chandy]], Kadavil Chandy Kathanar and Vengoor Geevarghese Kathanar .

The eighty-four churches and their congregations were the body from which the Syro Malabar Catholic Church has descended. The other thirty-two churches and their congregations represented the nucleus from which the Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church, the Thozhiyur Church, Thoma Syrian (Reformed Syrians), and Syro-Malankara Catholic Church have originated.<ref>Catholic Encyclopedia profile of \"St. Thomas Christians\" - The Carmelite Period</ref>\n\nIn 1665 [[Gregorios Abdal Jaleel|Gregorios]], a Bishop sent by the [[Syriac Orthodox Patriarch of Antioch]], arrived in India.

Those who accepted the West Syriac liturgical tradition of the [[Syriac Orthodox Church]] of Antioch of Gregorios became known as the Puthenkoor; they also continued to use the name \"Malankara\", the real name of the St. Thomas Christian community for the church. Those who joined the communion of Rome after the Synod of Daimper and remained in the communion even after the oath of bent cross, and those who joined the Catholic communion from the Puhenkoor Malankara church during the Carmelite period, came to be known as the '''Syro Malabar Church''' from the last decade of the Nineteenth century onwards.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/> Some of the churches not joined in the Angamaly Padiyola (1787) later became Latin churches, e.g. Mathilakom (Pappinivattom), Maliankara, Thuruthipuram, etc. One branch of the Syro Malabar Catholic church later left to form the Assyrian Church of the East aligned with [[Chaldean Syrian Church]] when an Eastern Syriac rite bishop, Gabriel, came to evangelize them in 1701. Kottayam Cheriapally was the headquarters of Gabriel.\n\n==Post-Coonan Cross Oath==\nThe Syro-Malabar Church descends from the part of the community known as ''Pazhayakuttukar'', or \"Old Party\", that after the [[Coonan Cross Oath]] in 1653 under the leadership of [[Palliveettil Mar Chandy|Palliveettil Chandy]] entered in formal communion with the [[Holy See]] of Rome again (which first happened after the Synod of diamper) due to the reconciliation efforts of [[Discalced Carmelites|Discalced Carmelite]] (O.C.D.) missionaries sent by [[Pope Alexander VII]] (1665\u201367). Latin Catholic Carmelite clergy from Europe served as bishops, and the Church along with the Latin Catholics was under the [[Apostolic Vicariate]] of Malabar (modern-day [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Verapoly]]). As per [[Paremmakkal Thoma Kathanar]]'s travelogue [[Varthamanappusthakam]] (dated to 1790), the Church was known then as the ''Malankare Kaldaya Suriyani Sabha'' \"Malankara Chaldean Syriac Church\". In 1887, the Holy See established two [[Apostolic Vicariate]]s, [[Syro-Malabar Catholic Archeparchy of Thrissur|Thrissur]] and [[Syro-Malabar Catholic Archeparchy of Changanassery|Kottayam]] (later Changanassery) under the guidance of indigenous Syro-Malabar bishops, and named the Church as \"The Syro-Malabar Church\" to distinguish them from the Latins.<ref name=\"Nedumparambil\">{{cite web|author=George Joseph Nedumparambil|date=2013|title=A Search of the Roots of the Syro-Malabar Church in Kerala|url=https://opus.bibliothek.uni-wuerzburg.de/opus4-wuerzburg/frontdoor/deliver/index/docId/6595/file/Joseph_Nedumparambil.pdf|accessdate=19 September 2019|publisher=University of W\u00fcrzburg}}</ref> The Holy See re-organized the Apostolic Vicariates in 1896 into three Apostolic Vicariates ([[Syro-Malabar Catholic Archeparchy of Thrissur|Thrissur]], [[Syro-Malabar Catholic Major Archeparchy of Ernakulam-Angamaly|Ernakulam]], and [[Syro-Malabar Catholic Archeparchy of Changanassery|Changanassery]]).

This is contrary to [[WP:MOS]]--->\n\nAfter the split in the church community, the Catholics of the Malabar coast faced an identity crisis and thus some priests and laymen attempted to persuade the hierarchy to improve the identity of the local church and for the appointment of bishops from local priests. To represent their position, Kerala's Syrian Catholics [[Mar Joseph Kariattil|Joseph Kariattil]] and [[Paremmakkal Thomma Kathanar]] went to [[Rome]] in 1778. While they were in Europe, Kariatty Joseph Kathanar was installed in Portugal as the Archbishop of [[Kodungalloor]] Archdiocese.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} While journeying home, they stayed in [[Goa]] where Kariattil died before he could formally take charge. Before he died, Kariattil appointed Kathanar as the Administrator of Kodungalloor Archdiocese after him. The new administrator ran the affairs of the church establishing his headquarters at [[Angamaly]]. In 1790, the headquarters of the Archdiocese was shifted to [[Vadayar]], dodging the invasion of [[Tippu Sultan]]. In the last four years of his life, Thomma Kathanar managed church administration from his own parish, [[Ramapuram, Kottayam|Ramapuram]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}\n\nAfter being under Babylonian [[Assyrian Church of the East]] (with Catholic faction known as [[Chaldean Catholic Church]] from 1681) bishops earlier, and under [[Latin Catholic Church|Latin Catholic]] bishops from 1599, Catholics of St. Thomas Christians obtained their own bishops from 1896. They were known as Catholic Chaldean Syrians during the period from around 1787(Angamaly Padiyola) to around 1911. They were known as the Catholic Syrians or Romo-Syrians to differentiate them from the Orthodox Syrians and [[Latin Church]] Catholics in Kerala. They came to be known as the Syro Malabar Catholics from 1932 onwards to differentiate them from the Syro-Malankara Catholics in Kerala.

During the celebration of the Qurbana, priests and deacons put on elaborate vestments which are unique to the Syro-Malabar Catholic Church.\n\n===Restoration of East Syriac liturgy===\n[[File:Mar George Cardinal Alencherry.jpg|thumb|Metropolitan and Gate of all India Geevarghese metropolitan, Successor of Marthoma Sleeha (St. Thomas Apostle).]]\n[[File:Crowning in Syro-Malabar Nasrani Wedding by Mar Gregory Karotemprel.jpg|thumb|Crowning Ceremony during a Syro-Malabar wedding]]\n[[East Syriac Rite|East Syriac]] [[liturgy]] has three [[Anaphora (liturgy)|anaphorae]]: those of [[Holy Qurbana of Addai and Mari|the Holy Apostles]] (Saints [[Addai]] and [[Saint Mari|Mari]]), [[Nestorius]], and [[Theodore the Interpreter]]. The first is the most popularly and extensively used. The second was traditionally used on the [[Epiphany (Christian)|Epiphany]] and the feasts of [[St. John the Baptist]] and of the [[Greek Doctor]]s, both of which occur in Epiphany-tide on the Wednesday of the Rogation of the Ninevites, and on Maundy Thursday. The third is used (except when the second is ordered) from [[Advent]] to [[Palm Sunday]]. The same pro-anaphoral part serves for all three.\n\nIn the second half of the 20th century, there was a movement for better understanding of the liturgical rites. A restored Eucharistic liturgy, drawing on the original East Syriac sources, was approved by [[Pope Pius XII]] in 1957, and for the first time on the feast of [[Thomas the Apostle|St. Thomas]] on 3 July 1962, the vernacular, [[Malayalam]], was introduced for the celebration of the Syro-Malabar Qurbana.<ref>The Origin and Progress of the Syro-Malabar Hierarchy By Varkey J. Vithayathil</ref> Currently they celebrate the Divine [[Liturgy of Addai and Mari]] and the Anaphora of Theodre in mostly Malayalam, with Syriac and English influences.\n\nBesides the '''Anaphora of Addai and Mari''' being used currently in Syro-Malabar liturgy, there are two more anaphorae known as Anaphora of Theodore and Anaphora of Nestorius. That the Anaphora of Theodore which was withdrawn from use after the Synod of Diamper(a large number of churches used it up to 1896) is being used again in the Syro-Malabar Church after 415 years is indeed an important historical reality. In a way the Syro-Malabar church rejected the [[Synod of Diamper]]. Pope Pius XII during the process of restoration of the Syro-Malabar Qurbana in 1957 had requested the restoration of the Anaphorae of Theodore and Nestorius. The draft of the Anaphora of Theodore was restored after meticulous study by the Central Liturgical Committee, Liturgical Research Centre, various sub-committees, and the eparchial liturgical commissions. Many changes befitting to the times have been made in the prayers maintaining maximum fidelity to the original text of the Second Anaphora.  It was this text so prepared that was sent to Rome for the recognition of the Apostolic See in accordance with the decision of the Syro-Malabar Synod. The Congregation for the Eastern Churches gave its approval for using this anaphora on an experimental basis for three years on 15 December 2012.<ref>Official Website</ref>\n\nAfter almost 420 years, the Anaphora of Nestorius is restored in the Syro-Malabar Church.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.syromalabarchurch.in/news_details.php?news=9670|title=Syro Malabar News Updates|last=|first=|date=|website=www.syromalabarchurch.in|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-02-28}}</ref> The aftermath of the so-called Synod of Diamper was that any texts related to Nestorius were systematically burnt by the Jesuits, who represented and ruled the Latin Church of India in 1599. In a way, the SyroMalabar church rejected the Synod of Diamber (Udayamperoor) by restoring the Anaphora of Theodore and Anaphora of Nestorius.\n\nThe [[Liturgical latinisation|Latinization]] of the Syro-Malabar rite churches was brought to a head when in 1896 [[Wladyslaw Michal Zaleski|Ladislaus Zaleski]], the [[Apostolic Delegate]] to [[India]], requested permission to translate the [[Roman Pontifical]] into [[Syriac language|Syriac]]. This was the choice of some Malabar prelates, who chose it over the [[East Syriac Rite]] and [[West Syriac Rite]] [[pontificals]]. A large number of Syro-Malabarians were Assyrian schismatics at that time and various problems and concerns delayed the approval of this translation, until in 1934 [[Pope Pius XI]] stated that Latinization was no longer to be encouraged among [[Eastern Rite Catholics]].<ref>The Synod of Diamper and the Liturgy Jacob Vellian The Synod of Diamper Revisited, George Nedugatt, ed.</ref> He initiated a process of liturgical reform that sought to restore the [[oriental]] nature of the Latinized Syro-Malabar rite.<ref>A Study of the Syro-Malabar Liturgy (George Vavanikunnel)</ref> A restored Eucharistic liturgy, drawing on the original East Syriac sources, was approved by Pius XII in 1957 and introduced in 1962.\n\nThe church uses one of several [[Bible translations into Malayalam]].\n\n===Liturgical calendar===\n[[File:Syro-Malabar Liturgical Calendar-2008.jpg|thumb|right|Syro-Malabar liturgical calendar]]\nSyro Malabar Church has its own [[liturgical year]].

Menezes held the [[Synod of Diamper]] in 1599 to bring the Thomas Christians under the authority of the Archbishopric of Goa.

The ancient or the independent church body was termed as the ''Puthenkuttukar'', or \"Party who is renewed (after shedding the catholic heresy)\", and resisted the authority of the Portuguese padroado. Under the leadership of metropolitan [[Mar Thoma I]] the ancient [[Malankara Church]] later entered into a new relationship with the [[Syriac Orthodox Church]] of [[Antioch]].<ref name=Gregorios285>Gregorios & Roberson, p. 285.</ref><ref name=Vadakkekara91>Vadakkekara, p. 91.</ref>\n\n==Coonan Cross Oath==\nA protest took place in 1653 with the [[Coonan Cross Oath]]. Under the leadership of Archdeacon Thomas, the Thomas Christians publicly took an oath that they would not obey the Jesuit Bishops or the Pope.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Eugene Cardinal Tisserant, \"Eastern Christianity in India\"</ref> Church historian KOOTHUR observes that \"the \u2018Coonan Cross\u2019 revolution obviously was the final outbreak of the storm that had been gathering on the horizon of the ecclesial life of the St. Thomas Christians for over a century.\"\n\nRome sent Carmelites in two groups from the [[Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples|Propagation of the Faith]] to Malabar headed by Fr. Sebastiani and Fr. Hyacinth. Fr. Sebastiani arrived first in 1655 and began to speak directly with the metropolitan, Mar Thoma I. Fr. Sebastiani, with the help of Portuguese, gained the support of many, especially with the support of [[Palliveettil Mar Chandy|Palliveettil Chandy]], Kadavil Chandy Kathanar and Vengoor Geevarghese Kathanar . These were the three of the four counselors of Thoma I, who had defected with Francisco Garcia Mendes, SJ, Archbishop of [[Kodungallur|Cranganore]], before the arrival of Sebastaini, according to Jesuit reports.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\nBetween 1661 and 1662, out of the 116 churches, the Carmelites claimed eighty-four churches, leaving the native metropolitan Thoma I with thirty-two churches. The eighty-four churches and their congregations were the body from which the Syro Malabar Catholic Church has descended. The other thirty-two churches and their congregations represented the nucleus from which the Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church, the Thozhiyur Church, Thoma Syrian (Reformed Syrians), and Syro-Malankara Catholic Church have originated.<ref>Catholic Encyclopedia profile of \"St. Thomas Christians\" - The Carmelite Period</ref>\n\nIn 1665 [[Gregorios Abdal Jaleel|Gregorios]], a Bishop sent by the [[Syriac Orthodox Patriarch of Antioch]], arrived in India. The independent group under the leadership of the Archdeacon welcomed him.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\">Thekkedath, History of Christianity in India\"</ref> Though most of the St. Thomas Christians gradually relented in their strong opposition to the Western control, the arrival of the Bishop [[Gregorios Abdal Jaleel|Gregorios]] of the Syriac Orthodox Church in 1665 marked the beginning of a formal schism among the St. Thomas Christians. Those who accepted the West Syriac liturgical tradition of the [[Syriac Orthodox Church]] of Antioch of Gregorios became known as the Puthenkoor; they also continued to use the name \"Malankara\", the real name of the St. Thomas Christian community for the church. Those who joined the communion of Rome after the Synod of Daimper and remained in the communion even after the oath of bent cross, and those who joined the Catholic communion from the Puhenkoor Malankara church during the Carmelite period, came to be known as the '''Syro Malabar Church''' from the last decade of the Nineteenth century onwards.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/> Some of the churches not joined in the Angamaly Padiyola (1787) later became Latin churches, e.g. Mathilakom (Pappinivattom), Maliankara, Thuruthipuram, etc. One branch of the Syro Malabar Catholic church later left to form the Assyrian Church of the East aligned with [[Chaldean Syrian Church]] when an Eastern Syriac rite bishop, Gabriel, came to evangelize them in 1701. Kottayam Cheriapally was the headquarters of Gabriel.\n\n==Post-Coonan Cross Oath==\nThe Syro-Malabar Church descends from the part of the community known as ''Pazhayakuttukar'', or \"Old Party\", that after the [[Coonan Cross Oath]] in 1653 under the leadership of [[Palliveettil Mar Chandy|Palliveettil Chandy]] entered in formal communion with the [[Holy See]] of Rome again (which first happened after the Synod of diamper) due to the reconciliation efforts of [[Discalced Carmelites|Discalced Carmelite]] (O.C.D.) missionaries sent by [[Pope Alexander VII]] (1665\u201367).

To represent their position, Kerala's Syrian Catholics [[Mar Joseph Kariattil|Joseph Kariattil]] and [[Paremmakkal Thomma Kathanar]] went to [[Rome]] in 1778. While they were in Europe, Kariatty Joseph Kathanar was installed in Portugal as the Archbishop of [[Kodungalloor]] Archdiocese.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} While journeying home, they stayed in [[Goa]] where Kariattil died before he could formally take charge. Before he died, Kariattil appointed Kathanar as the Administrator of Kodungalloor Archdiocese after him. The new administrator ran the affairs of the church establishing his headquarters at [[Angamaly]]. In 1790, the headquarters of the Archdiocese was shifted to [[Vadayar]], dodging the invasion of [[Tippu Sultan]]. In the last four years of his life, Thomma Kathanar managed church administration from his own parish, [[Ramapuram, Kottayam|Ramapuram]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}\n\nAfter being under Babylonian [[Assyrian Church of the East]] (with Catholic faction known as [[Chaldean Catholic Church]] from 1681) bishops earlier, and under [[Latin Catholic Church|Latin Catholic]] bishops from 1599, Catholics of St. Thomas Christians obtained their own bishops from 1896. They were known as Catholic Chaldean Syrians during the period from around 1787(Angamaly Padiyola) to around 1911. They were known as the Catholic Syrians or Romo-Syrians to differentiate them from the Orthodox Syrians and [[Latin Church]] Catholics in Kerala. They came to be known as the Syro Malabar Catholics from 1932 onwards to differentiate them from the Syro-Malankara Catholics in Kerala.

During the celebration of the Qurbana, priests and deacons put on elaborate vestments which are unique to the Syro-Malabar Catholic Church.\n\n===Restoration of East Syriac liturgy===\n[[File:Mar George Cardinal Alencherry.jpg|thumb|Metropolitan and Gate of all India Geevarghese metropolitan, Successor of Marthoma Sleeha (St. Thomas Apostle).]]\n[[File:Crowning in Syro-Malabar Nasrani Wedding by Mar Gregory Karotemprel.jpg|thumb|Crowning Ceremony during a Syro-Malabar wedding]]\n[[East Syriac Rite|East Syriac]] [[liturgy]] has three [[Anaphora (liturgy)|anaphorae]]: those of [[Holy Qurbana of Addai and Mari|the Holy Apostles]] (Saints [[Addai]] and [[Saint Mari|Mari]]), [[Nestorius]], and [[Theodore the Interpreter]]. The first is the most popularly and extensively used. The second was traditionally used on the [[Epiphany (Christian)|Epiphany]] and the feasts of [[St. John the Baptist]] and of the [[Greek Doctor]]s, both of which occur in Epiphany-tide on the Wednesday of the Rogation of the Ninevites, and on Maundy Thursday. The third is used (except when the second is ordered) from [[Advent]] to [[Palm Sunday]]. The same pro-anaphoral part serves for all three.\n\nIn the second half of the 20th century, there was a movement for better understanding of the liturgical rites. A restored Eucharistic liturgy, drawing on the original East Syriac sources, was approved by [[Pope Pius XII]] in 1957, and for the first time on the feast of [[Thomas the Apostle|St. Thomas]] on 3 July 1962, the vernacular, [[Malayalam]], was introduced for the celebration of the Syro-Malabar Qurbana.<ref>The Origin and Progress of the Syro-Malabar Hierarchy By Varkey J. Vithayathil</ref> Currently they celebrate the Divine [[Liturgy of Addai and Mari]] and the Anaphora of Theodre in mostly Malayalam, with Syriac and English influences.\n\nBesides the '''Anaphora of Addai and Mari''' being used currently in Syro-Malabar liturgy, there are two more anaphorae known as Anaphora of Theodore and Anaphora of Nestorius. That the Anaphora of Theodore which was withdrawn from use after the Synod of Diamper(a large number of churches used it up to 1896) is being used again in the Syro-Malabar Church after 415 years is indeed an important historical reality. In a way the Syro-Malabar church rejected the [[Synod of Diamper]]. Pope Pius XII during the process of restoration of the Syro-Malabar Qurbana in 1957 had requested the restoration of the Anaphorae of Theodore and Nestorius. The draft of the Anaphora of Theodore was restored after meticulous study by the Central Liturgical Committee, Liturgical Research Centre, various sub-committees, and the eparchial liturgical commissions. Many changes befitting to the times have been made in the prayers maintaining maximum fidelity to the original text of the Second Anaphora.  It was this text so prepared that was sent to Rome for the recognition of the Apostolic See in accordance with the decision of the Syro-Malabar Synod. The Congregation for the Eastern Churches gave its approval for using this anaphora on an experimental basis for three years on 15 December 2012.<ref>Official Website</ref>\n\nAfter almost 420 years, the Anaphora of Nestorius is restored in the Syro-Malabar Church.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.syromalabarchurch.in/news_details.php?news=9670|title=Syro Malabar News Updates|last=|first=|date=|website=www.syromalabarchurch.in|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-02-28}}</ref> The aftermath of the so-called Synod of Diamper was that any texts related to Nestorius were systematically burnt by the Jesuits, who represented and ruled the Latin Church of India in 1599. In a way, the SyroMalabar church rejected the Synod of Diamber (Udayamperoor) by restoring the Anaphora of Theodore and Anaphora of Nestorius.\n\nThe [[Liturgical latinisation|Latinization]] of the Syro-Malabar rite churches was brought to a head when in 1896 [[Wladyslaw Michal Zaleski|Ladislaus Zaleski]], the [[Apostolic Delegate]] to [[India]], requested permission to translate the [[Roman Pontifical]] into [[Syriac language|Syriac]]. This was the choice of some Malabar prelates, who chose it over the [[East Syriac Rite]] and [[West Syriac Rite]] [[pontificals]]. A large number of Syro-Malabarians were Assyrian schismatics at that time and various problems and concerns delayed the approval of this translation, until in 1934 [[Pope Pius XI]] stated that Latinization was no longer to be encouraged among [[Eastern Rite Catholics]].<ref>The Synod of Diamper and the Liturgy Jacob Vellian The Synod of Diamper Revisited, George Nedugatt, ed.</ref> He initiated a process of liturgical reform that sought to restore the [[oriental]] nature of the Latinized Syro-Malabar rite.<ref>A Study of the Syro-Malabar Liturgy (George Vavanikunnel)</ref> A restored Eucharistic liturgy, drawing on the original East Syriac sources, was approved by Pius XII in 1957 and introduced in 1962.\n\nThe church uses one of several [[Bible translations into Malayalam]].\n\n===Liturgical calendar===\n[[File:Syro-Malabar Liturgical Calendar-2008.jpg|thumb|right|Syro-Malabar liturgical calendar]]\nSyro Malabar Church has its own [[liturgical year]].

From its beginnings in 1892 as a small grocery store, it has grown to include 415 stores chain-wide.<ref>{{cite web |title=Stop & Shop |url=https://www.aholddelhaize.com/en/brands/united-states/stop-shop/ |website=AholdDelhaize.com |access-date=April 21, 2019}}</ref>\n\nStop & Shop has been a wholly owned subsidiary of the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] supermarket operator [[Ahold]] since 1995 and was part of the [[Stop & Shop/Giant-Landover]] division with sister chain [[Giant-Landover]] between 2004 and 2011. Ahold announced on June 24, 2015, that it would merge with [[Brussels]]-based [[Delhaize Group]], a [[Belgium|Belgian]] grocery store conglomerate whose U.S. grocery operations included [[Hannaford Brothers Company|Hannaford]] of [[Scarborough, Maine]] and [[Food Lion]] of [[Salisbury, North Carolina]]. The merger was completed on July 24, 2016, with the new holding company being named [[Ahold Delhaize]].\n\n==History==\n===Beginning===\nStop & Shop's roots can be traced back to 1892, when Solomon and Jeanie Rabinowitz opened a grocery shop, called the \"Greenie Store\", at 134 Salem Street, in Boston's [[North End, Boston|North End]]. This store operated at this location until 1908.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.northendboston.com/north-end-history-volume-4/ |title=North End History: Our Jewish Heritage |first=Guild |last=Nichols |access-date=April 21, 2019}}</ref> According to the company's web site, Stop & Shop was founded in 1914 in [[Somerville, Massachusetts|Somerville]], Massachusetts by the [[Rabinovitz/Rabb family|Rabinowitz family]] as the Economy Grocery Stores Company. Four years later, the store adopted the new self-service supermarket model recently pioneered by [[Piggly Wiggly]]. A second store opened later in 1914, several stores opened a year later and by 1917, the chain had 15 stores. Initially the stores sold only grocery items but soon after added meats, produce, milk, dairy, and some frozen foods. Like [[A & P]], they were pioneers of the modern grocery store selling all types of food items under one roof. Stores were 10,000 to 15,000 square feet and in downtown and inner city areas in the [[Boston]] and [[Springfield, Massachusetts|Springfield]] metro areas. The chain had grown to 86 supermarkets by 1946, when the name was officially changed to Stop & Shop, Inc.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://stopandshop.com/about/ |title=About Us |access-date=April 21, 2019}}</ref>\n\n===1950s\u20131970s===\nIn 1959, Stop & Shop had 100 stores by opening in Natick, Massachusetts. In 1961, Stop & Shop purchased the now-defunct [[department store]] chain [[Bradlees]], based in Connecticut. Later, in the 60s, they bought the three-store chain ORBIT'S stores and merged them into Bradlees. Stop & Shop stores in Massachusetts were opening in suburban areas and in shopping plazas. In the early 1950s, Stop & Shop entered Connecticut and Rhode Island, in the early 1960s in New York, and the late 1960s in New Jersey. With Bradlees in the company, Stop & Shop began offering non-food items in their supermarkets. In many areas Stop & Shop and Bradlees were adjacent, allowing one-stop shopping; several of these combination stores were designated Family Centers. Stop & Shop also operated the Medi-Mart pharmacy chain and the Perkins Tobacco chain.\n\n===1980s===\nIn 1980, Stop & Shop had supermarkets in Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island, New Jersey, and southern New York state. The stores were then typical in size at about {{convert|30000|sqft|m2}} on average. Many were next door to their then-co-owned Bradlees Department stores. In the New York and Philadelphia metro areas, Stop & Shop was not able to compete successfully. In 1982, Stop & Shop exited New Jersey, selling most of the stores that were profitable to [[A&P]], which would use these stores to replace their aging fleet of stores. A few stores were sold to [[ShopRite (United States)|Shop Rite]] owners as well as [[Foodtown]] owners. Other stores were closed and converted to other uses. In New York State, they sold some of their stores to A&P while selling others to [[Grand Union (supermarket)|Grand Union]] and closing others, converting them also to other uses.\n\nIn 1982, Stop & Shop built its first superstore in the [[Pembroke, Massachusetts]], area. Superstores were between {{convert|45000|sqft|m2}} and {{convert|80000|sqft|m2}}. In addition to traditional supermarket offerings, these stores featured bakeries, pharmacies, moderate selections of general merchandise one would not expect to find at a supermarket, expanded deli departments, cafes, and a salad bar. Some of these stores would feature a bank, expanded liquor and beer, video rentals, etc. Throughout the 1980s and into the 1990s, the traditional supermarkets were converted into superstores. Some were remodeled, others were torn down and a new store rebuilt in the same location, while others were closed and replaced with a superstore within two miles. By 1990, Stop & Shop operated in Connecticut, Rhode Island, and in the Boston and Springfield, Massachusetts. areas, with one store in New York state.\n\nIn the late 1980s, following an attempt hostile takeover bid by [[Herbert Haft]]'s [[Dart Drug|Dart Group]], The Stop & Shop Supermarket Company was acquired by [[leveraged buyout]] specialists [[Kohlberg Kravis Roberts]] and was taken private. Shortly thereafter, Medi-Mart was sold to Walgreens; Bradlees was spun off as its own corporation. After several years, while KKR explored merger possibilities with Safeway (which it also controlled at the time), Stop & Shop was sold at public offering.\n\n===1990s===\n[[Image:Super Stop & Shop 1024.jpg|thumb|A typical older location, using the old logo, since replaced. This location is in [[Yonkers, New York]].]]\n\nStop & Shop was acquired by the American branch of [[Netherlands|Dutch]] food giant [[Ahold]] in 1995. Ahold had previously acquired First National Supermarkets, whose '''Edwards Super Food Stores''' and '''[[Finast]]''' chains also had a strong presence in Connecticut; Ahold planned to operate both Edwards and Stop & Shop there. However, in the wake of the acquisition, [[Connecticut Attorney General]] [[Richard Blumenthal]] raised [[antitrust]] questions, as Stop & Shop and Edwards combined had more than half of the grocery share in Connecticut. Following negotiations with Blumenthal, Ahold decided to convert its New England stores to the Stop & Shop banner, while selling some locations to other chains such as [[Shaw's]], [[ShopRite (United States)|Shop Rite]], and [[Grand Union (supermarket)|Grand Union]]. Ahold also began building a few stores under the Edwards Super Food Stores banner in New York state and New Jersey. Ahold also acquired 26 independent Mayfair [[Foodtown (United States)|Foodtown]] stores in that area, converting them to Edwards. In 1998 and 1999, several Super Stop & Shop stores were built in the Poughkeepsie area.\n\n[[File:Stop & Shop.JPG|thumb|A newer Stop & Shop in [[Saugus, Massachusetts]].]]\n\nIn 1999, Ahold announced its plan to acquire [[Pathmark]] supermarkets. Under that deal Edwards stores would be renamed Pathmark along with both sets of Giant stores. Late in 2000, after Grand Union was about to enter [[Chapter 7, Title 11, United States Code|Chapter 7]] bankruptcy and liquidate (by coincidence that the Bradlees chain was liquidating), Ahold walked away from the Pathmark deal; it proposed acquiring many of the Grand Union locations instead. At that point, Ahold continued the transition of its Edwards stores, converting all of its New York and New Jersey locations to the Stop & Shop format late in 2000. In 2001, Ahold acquired most of the Grand Union locations in New Jersey and New York state south of Kingston. These were all renamed Stop & Shop. Other locations went to other supermarket chains, non-food chains, or closed altogether. In 2003, Ahold acquired many of the A&P Foodmart locations in the [[Hartford, Connecticut]] area, Rhode Island, Massachusetts, and the one remaining New Hampshire store. Other A&P locations in that region closed or were sold to other supermarket chains. In 2004, Ahold integrated Stop & Shop Supermarkets with [[Giant Food of Landover, Maryland|Giant Food LLC]] and created one combined company with the name of [[Stop & Shop/Giant-Landover]].\n\nIn 1994, Giant-Landover began northern expansion by opening stores in [[Pennsylvania]], [[Delaware]], and [[New Jersey]] under the '''Super G''' trade name. This was done to differentiate itself from future sister company Giant Food Stores of [[Carlisle, Pennsylvania]]. During 2005, the newly formed Stop & Shop/Giant made the decision to phase out the Super G name in New Jersey and Delaware. In New Jersey, four Super G stores were shuttered and the remaining eight stores were converted to the '''Super Stop & Shop''' banner and became a part of Stop & Shop's New York Sales Division in an attempt to revive sales at the stores. These stores continued to underperform and were subsequently sold in 2007 to ShopRite franchise owners.  The Delaware Super G stores were to be remodeled under the Super Stop & Shop format and reopened under the Super Giant banner. Super G stores in Pennsylvania were generally close to Giant-Carlisle locations and were converted to Giant of Carlisle stores but continued to be unionized unlike most of the other Carlisle bannered stores.\n\n===2000s===\nIn 2006, Stop & Shop signed a contract with [[Starbucks]], placing the coffee shop chain's licensed stores inside certain supermarkets. Many Stop & Shop stores feature [[Dunkin' Donuts]] outlets inside the store. Also in May 2006, Stop & Shop began piloting the Shopping Buddy program in select stores in Massachusetts and Connecticut. The Shopping Buddy is a [[Personal shopping assistants|personal shopping assistant]] that allows customers to track their purchases and to do in-cart bagging as they move through the store.\n\nIn October 2007, Stop & Shop launched an advertising campaign which was intended to have users submit stories and videos to a website detailing their grocery store experiences. The campaign was significant in that it is an early example of a regional traditional brand employing [[Web 2.0]] concepts such as [[user-generated content]] to promote their stores.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://adage.com/article/cmo-strategy/expand-brand-community-online/122867 |title=Expand your brand community online |first=Patrick |last=Hanlon |publisher=Advertising Age |date=January 7, 2008 |access-date=April 21, 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn 2007, Stop & Shop made an attempt to expand further into northern New England. They built, but did not operate, a single [[Vermont]] store in Rutland before selling it to rival supermarket operator [[Delhaize]]. Delhaize opened the store under its [[Hannaford Bros. Co.|Hannaford]] banner in February 2008.\n\nIn July 2007, Stop & Shop opened a single [[Maine]] store in Kennebunk. The store was closed in October 2009, citing slow sales as the primary reason. At the same time, they abandoned plans to build a second Maine store in Portland.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://updates.pressherald.mainetoday.com/updates/stop-shop-backing-out-of-maine |title=Stop & Shop backing out of Maine |newspaper=Portland Press Herald |date=October 6, 2009 |access-date=April 21, 2019 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120227172806/http://updates.mainetoday.com/updates/stop-shop-backing-out-of-maine |archive-date=February 27, 2012}}</ref> [[Delhaize]] purchased the vacant Kennebunk location in December 2009 and later reopened the property under the [[Hannaford Bros.

Investigators, however, found that Stop & Shop\u2019s actions did not violate the state\u2019s antitrust laws and the investigation was closed, she said.

From its beginnings in 1892 as a small grocery store, it has grown to include 415 stores chain-wide.<ref>{{cite web |title=Stop & Shop |url=https://www.aholddelhaize.com/en/brands/united-states/stop-shop/ |website=AholdDelhaize.com |access-date=April 21, 2019}}</ref>\n\nStop & Shop has been a wholly owned subsidiary of the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] supermarket operator [[Ahold]] since 1995 and was part of the [[Stop & Shop/Giant-Landover]] division with sister chain [[Giant-Landover]] between 2004 and 2011. Ahold announced on June 24, 2015, that it would merge with [[Brussels]]-based [[Delhaize Group]], a [[Belgium|Belgian]] grocery store conglomerate whose U.S. grocery operations included [[Hannaford Brothers Company|Hannaford]] of [[Scarborough, Maine]] and [[Food Lion]] of [[Salisbury, North Carolina]]. The merger was completed on July 24, 2016, with the new holding company being named [[Ahold Delhaize]].\n\n==History==\n===Beginning===\nStop & Shop's roots can be traced back to 1892, when Solomon and Jeanie Rabinowitz opened a grocery shop, called the \"Greenie Store\", at 134 Salem Street, in Boston's [[North End, Boston|North End]]. This store lasted at this location until 1908.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.northendboston.com/north-end-history-volume-4/ |title=North End History: Our Jewish Heritage |first=Guild |last=Nichols |access-date=April 21, 2019}}</ref> According to the company's web site, Stop & Shop was founded in 1914 in [[Somerville, Massachusetts|Somerville]], Massachusetts by the [[Rabinovitz/Rabb family|Rabinowitz family]] as the Economy Grocery Stores Company. Four years later, the store adopted the new self-service supermarket model recently pioneered by [[Piggly Wiggly]]. A second store opened later in 1914, several stores opened a year later and by 1917, the chain had 15 stores. Initially the stores sold only grocery items but soon after added meats, produce, milk, dairy, and some frozen foods. Like [[A & P]], they were pioneers of the modern grocery store selling all types of food items under one roof. Stores were 10,000 to 15,000 square feet and in downtown and inner city areas in the [[Boston]] and [[Springfield, Massachusetts|Springfield]] metro areas. The chain had grown to 86 supermarkets by 1946, when the name was officially changed to Stop & Shop, Inc.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://stopandshop.com/about/ |title=About Us |access-date=April 21, 2019}}</ref>\n\n===1950s\u20131970s===\nIn 1959, Stop & Shop had 100 stores by opening in Natick, Massachusetts. In 1961, Stop & Shop purchased the now-defunct [[department store]] chain [[Bradlees]], based in Connecticut. Later, in the 60s, they bought the three-store chain ORBIT'S stores and merged them into Bradlees. Stop & Shop stores in Massachusetts were opening in suburban areas and in shopping plazas. In the early 1950s, Stop & Shop entered Connecticut and Rhode Island, in the early 1960s in New York, and the late 1960s in New Jersey. With Bradlees in the company, Stop & Shop began offering non-food items in their supermarkets. In many areas Stop & Shop and Bradlees were adjacent, allowing one-stop shopping; several of these combination stores were designated Family Centers. Stop & Shop also operated the Medi-Mart pharmacy chain and the Perkins Tobacco chain.\n\n===1980s===\nIn 1980, Stop & Shop had supermarkets in Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island, New Jersey, and southern New York state. The stores were then typical in size at about {{convert|30000|sqft|m2}} on average. Many were next door to their then-co-owned Bradlees Department stores. In the New York and Philadelphia metro areas, Stop & Shop was not able to compete successfully. In 1982, Stop & Shop exited New Jersey, selling most of the stores that were profitable to [[A&P]], which would use these stores to replace their aging fleet of stores. A few stores were sold to [[ShopRite (United States)|Shop Rite]] owners as well as [[Foodtown]] owners. Other stores were closed and converted to other uses. In New York State, they sold some of their stores to A&P while selling others to [[Grand Union (supermarket)|Grand Union]] and closing others, converting them also to other uses.\n\nIn 1982, Stop & Shop built its first superstore in the [[Pembroke, Massachusetts]], area. Superstores were between {{convert|45000|sqft|m2}} and {{convert|80000|sqft|m2}}. In addition to traditional supermarket offerings, these stores featured bakeries, pharmacies, moderate selections of general merchandise one would not expect to find at a supermarket, expanded deli departments, cafes, and a salad bar. Some of these stores would feature a bank, expanded liquor and beer, video rentals, etc. Throughout the 1980s and into the 1990s, the traditional supermarkets were converted into superstores. Some were remodeled, others were torn down and a new store rebuilt in the same location, while others were closed and replaced with a superstore within two miles. By 1990, Stop & Shop operated in Connecticut, Rhode Island, and in the Boston and Springfield, Massachusetts. areas, with one store in New York state.\n\nIn the late 1980s, following an attempt hostile takeover bid by [[Herbert Haft]]'s [[Dart Drug|Dart Group]], The Stop & Shop Supermarket Company was acquired by [[leveraged buyout]] specialists [[Kohlberg Kravis Roberts]] and was taken private. Shortly thereafter, Medi-Mart was sold to Walgreens; Bradlees was spun off as its own corporation. After several years, while KKR explored merger possibilities with Safeway (which it also controlled at the time), Stop & Shop was sold at public offering.\n\n===1990s===\n[[Image:Super Stop & Shop 1024.jpg|thumb|A typical older location, using the old logo, since replaced. This location is in [[Yonkers, New York]].]]\n\nStop & Shop was acquired by the American branch of [[Netherlands|Dutch]] food giant [[Ahold]] in 1995. Ahold had previously acquired First National Supermarkets, whose '''Edwards Super Food Stores''' and '''[[Finast]]''' chains also had a strong presence in Connecticut; Ahold planned to operate both Edwards and Stop & Shop there. However, in the wake of the acquisition, [[Connecticut Attorney General]] [[Richard Blumenthal]] raised [[antitrust]] questions, as Stop & Shop and Edwards combined had more than half of the grocery share in Connecticut. Following negotiations with Blumenthal, Ahold decided to convert its New England stores to the Stop & Shop banner, while selling some locations to other chains such as [[Shaw's]], [[ShopRite (United States)|Shop Rite]], and [[Grand Union (supermarket)|Grand Union]]. Ahold also began building a few stores under the Edwards Super Food Stores banner in New York state and New Jersey. Ahold also acquired 26 independent Mayfair [[Foodtown (United States)|Foodtown]] stores in that area, converting them to Edwards. In 1998 and 1999, several Super Stop & Shop stores were built in the Poughkeepsie area.\n\n[[File:Stop & Shop.JPG|thumb|A newer Stop & Shop in [[Saugus, Massachusetts]].]]\n\nIn 1999, Ahold announced its plan to acquire [[Pathmark]] supermarkets. Under that deal Edwards stores would be renamed Pathmark along with both sets of Giant stores. Late in 2000, after Grand Union was about to enter [[Chapter 7, Title 11, United States Code|Chapter 7]] bankruptcy and liquidate (by coincidence that the Bradlees chain was liquidating), Ahold walked away from the Pathmark deal; it proposed acquiring many of the Grand Union locations instead. At that point, Ahold continued the transition of its Edwards stores, converting all of its New York and New Jersey locations to the Stop & Shop format late in 2000. In 2001, Ahold acquired most of the Grand Union locations in New Jersey and New York state south of Kingston. These were all renamed Stop & Shop. Other locations went to other supermarket chains, non-food chains, or closed altogether. In 2003, Ahold acquired many of the A&P Foodmart locations in the [[Hartford, Connecticut]] area, Rhode Island, Massachusetts, and the one remaining New Hampshire store. Other A&P locations in that region closed or were sold to other supermarket chains. In 2004, Ahold integrated Stop & Shop Supermarkets with [[Giant Food of Landover, Maryland|Giant Food LLC]] and created one combined company with the name of [[Stop & Shop/Giant-Landover]].\n\nIn 1994, Giant-Landover began northern expansion by opening stores in [[Pennsylvania]], [[Delaware]], and [[New Jersey]] under the '''Super G''' trade name. This was done to differentiate itself from future sister company Giant Food Stores of [[Carlisle, Pennsylvania]]. During 2005, the newly formed Stop & Shop/Giant made the decision to phase out the Super G name in New Jersey and Delaware. In New Jersey, four Super G stores were shuttered and the remaining eight stores were converted to the '''Super Stop & Shop''' banner and became a part of Stop & Shop's New York Sales Division in an attempt to revive sales at the stores. These stores continued to underperform and were subsequently sold in 2007 to ShopRite franchise owners.  The Delaware Super G stores were to be remodeled under the Super Stop & Shop format and reopened under the Super Giant banner. Super G stores in Pennsylvania were generally close to Giant-Carlisle locations and were converted to Giant of Carlisle stores but continued to be unionized unlike most of the other Carlisle bannered stores.\n\n===2000s===\nIn 2006, Stop & Shop signed a contract with [[Starbucks]], placing the coffee shop chain's licensed stores inside certain supermarkets. Many Stop & Shop stores feature [[Dunkin' Donuts]] outlets inside the store. Also in May 2006, Stop & Shop began piloting the Shopping Buddy program in select stores in Massachusetts and Connecticut. The Shopping Buddy is a [[Personal shopping assistants|personal shopping assistant]] that allows customers to track their purchases and to do in-cart bagging as they move through the store.\n\nIn October 2007, Stop & Shop launched an advertising campaign which was intended to have users submit stories and videos to a website detailing their grocery store experiences. The campaign was significant in that it is an early example of a regional traditional brand employing [[Web 2.0]] concepts such as [[user-generated content]] to promote their stores.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://adage.com/article/cmo-strategy/expand-brand-community-online/122867 |title=Expand your brand community online |first=Patrick |last=Hanlon |publisher=Advertising Age |date=January 7, 2008 |access-date=April 21, 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn 2007, Stop & Shop made an attempt to expand further into northern New England. They built, but did not operate, a single [[Vermont]] store in Rutland before selling it to rival supermarket operator [[Delhaize]]. Delhaize opened the store under its [[Hannaford Bros. Co.|Hannaford]] banner in February 2008.\n\nIn July 2007, Stop & Shop opened a single [[Maine]] store in Kennebunk. The store was closed in October 2009, citing slow sales as the primary reason.

The restrictions state that the property cannot be used to sell fresh fruits and vegetables, baked goods, dairy products, frozen foods, fish, poultry, and meat. The restrictions remain in effect for a total of 99 years. The property, which was purchased by Daniel J. Quirk and developed as a car dealership, sits directly across the highway from a Super Stop & Shop.<ref name=\"CapeCod\">{{cite news |url=https://www.capecodtimes.com/article/20150906/NEWS/150909695 |title=Stop & Shop's land grab on Cape Cod |first=Madeleine |last=List |date=September 6, 2015|access-date=April 21, 2019}}</ref> In 2003 Connecticut Attorney General Richard Blumenthal, who has since become a U.S. senator, opened an investigation into Stop & Shop for its land-acquisition practices and allegations of anti-competitive behavior in the early 1990s, said Jaclyn Falkowskie, spokeswoman for the Connecticut Attorney General. Investigators, however, found that Stop & Shop\u2019s actions did not violate the state\u2019s antitrust laws and the investigation was closed, she said. Regardless of the strategy's legality, consumer advocates find fault because it limits the potential number of supermarkets in an area, reducing competition and selection for consumers.<ref name=\"CapeCod\" /> Another shell company with ties to Stop & Shop placed similar deed restrictions on a property in Harwich before selling it to Eastward Homes Business Trust in 2006. The wording is materially similar, going so far as to list specific brands of pet food under restriction. The restrictions can remain in place for up to 90 years.<ref name=\"CapeCod\" />\n\n==Contract negotiations and complications==\n===2007===\nOn February 17, 2007, the collective bargaining agreements between Stop & Shop management and its employees expired after three years.

It is patchily distributed in [[Queensland]], roughly southeast of a line between [[Mackay, Queensland|Mackay]] and [[Charleville, Queensland|Charleville]]; it is somewhat more common in the southeast of the state. In [[New South Wales]], it occurs throughout the [[New England Tablelands (biogeographic region)|New England Tablelands]] and the [[South West Slopes]], extending westward to the [[Pilliga Scrub]] and to [[Griffith, New South Wales|Griffith]] in the [[Riverina]], and eastwards into the [[Hunter Valley]]. It is fairly common in the [[Australian Capital Territory]]. In [[Victoria]], the speckled warbler is found within a broad strip, including the [[Chiltern Box-Ironbark National Park|Chiltern Box-Ironbark]] and [[Warby-Ovens National Park]]s, the [[Bendigo]] region, the [[Brisbane Ranges]] and [[You Yangs Regional Park|You Yangs]], across to Balmoral on the western side of the [[Grampians National Park|Grampians]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://ebird.org/map/spewar3|title=eBirdmap: Speckled warbler|accessdate=2020-04-22}}</ref> It is scarce to moderately common within its range.<ref name=Morcombe></ref> Its preferred habitat is open eucalypt woodland with rocky gullies, tussocky grass, scattered logs, and sparse shrubbery.<ref name=Morcombe></ref>\n\n==Behaviour==\nThe speckled warbler is quiet and well camouflaged.

The cathedrals are notable particularly for their great height, and their extensive use of [[stained glass]] to fill the interiors with light.  They were the tallest and largest buildings of their time, and the most prominent examples of [[Gothic architecture]]. The appearance of the Gothic Cathedral was not only a revolution in architecture;  it also introduced new forms in decoration, sculpture, and art.\n\n[[Cathedrals]] were by definition churches where a [[bishop]] presided.  Abbeys were the churches attached to monasteries.  Many smaller [[parish]] churches were also built in the Gothic style. The appearance of the great cathedrals in the 12th century was a response to the dramatic increase of population and wealth in some parts of Europe, and the need for larger and more imposing buildings.  Technical advances, such an innovative uses of the  [[pointed arch]], [[rib vault]] and [[flying buttress]], allowed the churches and cathedral to become much  taller, stronger, with larger windows and more light.\n\nThe Gothic style first appeared in France at the  [[Abbey of Saint Denis]], near Paris, with the rebuilding of the ambulatory and west facade  of the Abbey church by the Abbot [[Suger]] (1135\u201340).<ref name=\"Laz\u00e9, 2006 p. 36\">Renault and Laz\u00e9, ''Les styles de l'architecture et du mobile'' (2006), p. 36</ref>. The first Gothic cathedral in France,  [[Sens Cathedral]],  was begun between 1135 and 1140, and consecrated in 1164.  <ref>Centre des Monuments Nationaux, ''Le Guide due Patrimoine en France'' (2002), p. 153</ref> \n\nThe style quickly appeared in England, where it was called simply \"The French style.\"   The Choir of [[Canterbury Cathedral]] was destroyed by fire, and was rebuilt by a French master builder from Sens,   [[William of Sens]] between 1174 and 1184.     Other elements of the style were imported from [[Caen]] in Normandy by French Norman architects, who also brought finely-cut stones from Normandy for their construction. \n\n[[Notre Dame de Paris|Notre Dame Cathedral]] was begun in 1163, and consecrated in 1177.<ref name=\"Laz\u00e9, 2006 p. 36\"/>  The later part of the 12th century and beginning of the 13th century saw a more refined style, characterised by [[Chartres Cathedral]], [[Reims Cathedral]], and [[Amiens Cathedral]].  A third period, called ''Rayonnante'' in France, more highly decorated, as characterized by [[Sainte Chapelle]] (1241-1248) and [[Amiens Cathedral]] in France.  The fourth and final period, called ''Flamboyante'', appeared in the second half of the 14th century, taking its name from the flamelike motifs of decoration.  [[Sainte-Chapelle de Vincennes]] (1370), with its walls of stained glass, is a good example.\n\nRenaissance cathedrals and churches gradually replaced Gothic cathedrals, and the original cathedrals, such as Notre Dame, experienced many modifications or fell into ruin.   However, in the mid-19th century, in large part due to the novel ''Notre Dame de Paris'', better known in English as [[The Hunchback of Notre-Dame]], by  [[Victor Hugo]], there was a new wave of interest in the Gothic cathedral. Many Gothic cathedrals and churches were restored, with greater or lesser  accuracy.\n\n==Name==\nThe term [[cathedral]] came from the Greek ''cathedra'', or \"seat\", since it was the official seat of the Bishop, or ''Eveque'', and the principal church of the [[diocese]].   His title came from the Greek term ''Episkopos'', or \"he who sees.\"  As the leader of the [[diocese]]. The Bishop was considered the direct descendant of the [[Apostles]] or disciples of Christ, and had three missions: to direct the affairs of the church within the diocese, to administer the sacraments, and teach the [[Gospels]], or the message of Christ. The Bishop of a cathedral was assisted by the [[Canon (priest)|Canon]]s, or ''Chanoines' in French,   who formed a council called the Chapter.<ref>Mignon, Olivier, ''Architecture des Cath\u00e9drales Gothiques'', (2015), pg. 4</ref>\n\nAt its time, it was called \"The French Style\"   The term \"Gothic\" was a very negative term invented in the late Renaissance by its critics, including the art historian and architect [[Giorgio Vasari]].  They considered the style was barbaric, the opposite of the new Renaissance style that they favored.\n\n== Early Gothic Mid-12th century ==\n===Abbot Suger and the Basilica of Saint Denis===\n \t\nThe Gothic style first appeared in France in the mid-12th century in an [[Abbey]], [[St Denis Basilica]], built by Abbot [[Suger]] (1081-1151).  The old Basilica was the traditional burial place of [[Denis|Saint Denis]], and of the Kings of France, and was also a very popular pilgrimage destination, so much so that pilgrims were sometimes crushed by the crowds.   Suger became the abbot of Saint Denis in 1122.  He became the friend and confident of two French Kings [[Louis VI of France|Louis VI]] and [[Louis VII of France|Louis VII]], and  He served the Regent for Louis VII during the absence of the King for the [[Second Crusade]] (1147-49).  \n \t\nSuger, with the full support of the King, decided to enlarge the church and reconstruct it on a new model.  <ref name = universalis>''Dictionnaire des Architectes'', Encyclopedia Universalis (1999), pp. 659-663</ref>   His first modification was a new west facade, inspired in part by new churches is Normandy,  with two towers and three deep portals.   Each of the portals had a [[tympanum (architecture)|tympanum]] of sculpture, telling a Biblical or inspiring story.  the tympana installed by Sugar depicted the Last Judgement over the main door and the Martyrdom of Saint Denis over the other door.   The tympana  over the east portals became a characteristic feature of later Gothic cathedrals. <ref>Mignon, ''Architecture des Cath\u00e9drale Gothiques'' (205), p. 9</ref> \n\nWhen the new facade was complete, Suger turned his attention to the choir and the ambulatory in the west of thehe Suger was also a scholar of the philosophy of [[Plato]], and he believed thet light was a way by which the faithful could be elevated from the material to the immaterial and the divine. The ambulatory of old church was very dark, since Romanesque architecture, with barrel vaults,  required thick walls and supporting walls  between the small chapels.  Suger decided to use a new form of vault, the [[rib vault]], with [[Pointed arch|pointed arches]], which was higher and stronger.  This allowed him to remove the walls between the chapels, and opened the space for seventy stained glass windows in the choir, filling the church with light. {{Sfn|Mignon|2015|page=9}} \n\nThe new structure was finished and dedicated on 11 June 1144, in the presence of the King. The choir and west front of the Abbey of Saint-Denis both became the prototypes for further building in the royal domain of northern France and in the Duchy of Normandy. Through the rule of the [[House of Plantagenet|Angevin dynasty]], the new style was introduced to England and spread throughout France, the [[Low Countries]], Germany, Spain, northern [[Italy]] and [[Sicily]].This combination of innovations made Saint-Denis the first important example of Gothic architecture;   The church was heavily modified over the following centuries, but the ambulatory and some other original elements remain.<ref>''Le Guide du Patrimoine en France'', Centre des Monuments National, Paris, 2002. \"The Basilica, along with its ''chevet'', constitutes the first masterpiece of Gothic architecture.\" </ref>\n \t\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:StDenis Chorumgang.JPG|The Gothic ambulatory of the [[Basilica of Saint-Denis]] (1140-1144)\t\nFile:Saint-Denis - Fa\u00e7ade.jpg|The west facade of the [[Basilica of Saint-Denis]], after restoration.

Two were built by Suger's personal friends, the bishops of Noyon and Senlis.  The spread of the style was not limited to cathedrals;  it also soon appeared in Abbey churches, at St. Leu d'Esserent in [[Braine, Aisne|Braine]], and, in the province of [[Champagne]], at St. Remy in [[Rheims]] and Notre-Dame in [[Chalons-sur-Marne]].  It also appeared in  simple churches, such as the Gothic church of Saint Quiriace in [[Provins]]  Though each church employed the new style, each had a distinctly different appearance and personality. <ref>O'Reilly, Elizabeth Boyle, ''How France Built Her Cathedrals'', Chapter III.</ref>     \n\n*'''[[Noyon Cathedral]]''' replaced a Romanesque cathedral which burned in 1131. The Bishop of Noyon, Baudouin, used the choir of Saint Denis as his direct model. He used the same masons as Suger, and much of the ornamentation is identical with Saint-Denis. Like many early Gothic churches, the interior has both round and pointed arches, and it has some peculiar Germanic features, such as transepts with rounded ends.  \n\n*'''[[Sens Cathedral]]''', begun in 1133, had a special place among cathedrals in France as the primate of Gaul, ranking of higher authority than Paris, a title it held down the 16th century. It attracted important medieval religious figures including [[Bernard of Clairvaux|Saint Bernard]], [[Abelard]] and [[Thomas Becket]], who came there in 1164 to appeal the Pope for support against [[Henry II of England]].  It was begun as a Romanesque cathedral, but as the walls were rising, the design was changed to Gothic and the proposed groin vaults replaced by [[rib vault|rib vaults]]. It was completed soon after Saint Denis, and is considered the first Gothic Cathedral in France. <ref>Centre des Monuments Nationaux, ''Le Guide due Patrimoine en France'' (2002), p. 153</ref> \n\n* '''[[Senlis Cathedral]]''' begun in 1152, was another very early Gothic cathedral built on the model of Saint-Denis by Bishop Thibaut, who had been at the deathbed of Suger. One distinctive feature is the sculpture in the central western portal, which depicts the Death of the Virgin Mary and her Assumption on the [[lintel]], and her Coronation in the [[tympanum (architecture)|tympanum]].  This arrangement became a common Gothic feature, found at both the north portal of [[Chartres Cathedral]] and the northwest tower of [[Notre Dame de Paris]].   A major fire in 1504 destroyed the upper vaulting of the original cathedral, and now only the apse, the west facade, and the tower have their original appearance; The exterior is now distinctly flamboyant Gothic. <ref>O'Reilly, Chapter III </ref>\n\n* '''[[Laon Cathedral]]''' was begun in about 1160. Like many early Gothic cathedrals, it retained some romanesque features, including tribunes over the side aisles, a use of both round a pointed arches, and a two story chapel on each arm of the transept. Like most early Gothic churches, it was not exceptionally bigh, but it was exceptional long, with eleven bays in the nave, and ten in the choir. Because it was not high, it was possible to build a square tower over the crossing of the transept, in addition to four shorter towers on the corners, each with long lancet openings. One curious feature are the sixteen life-sized sculpted oxen on towers, each under its own canopy, symbolizing the animals which hauled the stones to the site.  <ref>O'Reilly, Chapter III </ref>\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Cath\u00e9drale de Noyon straight.JPG|[[Noyon Cathedral]] (begun about 1150)\nFile:Interior of Cath\u00e9drale Saint-\u00c9tienne de Sens-6974.jpg|Nave of [[Sens Cathedral]] (1140-1164)\nFile:Senlis Cathedral Exterior, Picardy, France - Diliff.jpg| [[Senlis Cathedral]] (1153\u201391): The original 12th-century tower  was crowned with a octagonal tower and spire in the 13th century. \nFile:Laon, Cath\u00e9drale Notre-Dame PM 14294.jpg|Facade of [[Laon Cathedral]] {begun 1160)\n</gallery>\n* '''[[Notre Dame de Paris]]''' begun in 1163 by the archbishop [[Maurice de Sully]], was the largest and highest of the new French cathedrals. The nave was 122 meters long and the vaulted ceiling was 35 meters high, twelve meters higher than Laon Cathedral.  It used the older six-part [[rib vault]] in the ceiling, but replaced the alternating pillars and columns of earlier cathedrals with a single type of pillar, creating greater harmony. It made innovative use of [[flying buttress]] to counterbalance the weight of the higher vaults, so the walls could be thinner and have more windows. It had four levels, like the earlier cathedrals, but the old [[triforium]] was replaced by small rose windows. Unlike Laon Cathedral, the facade of Notre Dame, with its two towers, expressed a remarkable calm and harmony.Notre-Dame was modified in the later Gothic period, with the addition of the rose windows in the transepts (1250-1260) and double flying buttresses.    {{Sfn|Mignon|2015|pp. 18-19}}\n\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Notre-Dame de Paris 2013-07-24.jpg|The facade of [[Notre-Dame de Paris]] (begun 1163)\nFile:Nave of Notre-Dame de Paris, 22 June 2014 002.jpg|Nave of Notre-Dame de Paris, 122 meters long\n\n</gallery>\n\n=== Early English cathedrals and churches ===\nGothic elements, often called \"The French style\". soon appeared in English cathedrals and abbeys.  While English cathedrals tended to follow the French style, they had a few special charactersics of their own,  Unlike French cathedrals, they tended to great length rather than great height.  They also made extensive of [[Purbeck Marble]]  for columns, floors and wall panels, which added color and reflection to the interiors.  The early English style lasted from the late 12th century to the mid-14th century. <ref>Encylopaedia Britannica on-line, ''Early Gothic Architecture'', (retrieved April 19, 2020)</ref>\n* '''[[Canterbury Cathedral]]''' (Early Gothic portion - 1174-85) One of the earliest to use Gothic features in the French way was [[Canterbury Cathedral]]. Following a fire in 1174 which destroyed much of the choir, a French master builder, [[William of Sens]], who probably had participated in the construction of [[Sens Cathedral]], was selected to conduct the reconstruction.  It was rebuilt between 1174 and 1184.  William of Sens himself fell fifty feet from the scaffolding and was seriously injured, and had to return to France, where he died in 1180. It was completed by sn English builder, [[William the Englishman]]. <ref>Encylopaedia Britannica on-line edition, \"William of Sens\", retrieved April 19, 2020</ref> While the choir is not as high some French cathedrals, it makes up for the difference by its dramatic length. The choir is 180 ft (55 m) long and 71 ft (22 m) high. \n\nThe nave and much of the rest of the cathedral were rebuilt into the [[perpendicular style]] beginning in the late 14th century. The new transepts and aisles were given the more decorative  [[Lierne (vault)|Lierne vault]], where ribs were connected to each other for decorative rather than structural effect.  The crossing tower was begun in 1433, and is 23t feet (72 metes) high. Alterations to the Cathedral continued until 1834. \n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Canterbury-cathedral-wyrdlight.jpg|[[Canterbury Cathedral (1174-1834) The exterior was largely rebuilt into the perpendicular style in the 14th and 15th century. \nFile:Canterbury Cathedral Choir (40805457492).jpg|Choir of [[Canterbury Cathedral]] by [[William of Sens]] (1174\u201384).

The builders made use of the Gothic [[rib vault]] in constructing the new nave and choir. These were replaced by the  more decorative [[lierne (vault)|lierne vault]] in the late 13th century.  Two  [[rose windows]], called the Bishops's Eye and the Dean's Eye, were added at about there same time.   The original cathedral had two towers on the wsst facade, and then  a central tower was built in the 14th century,  topped by a wooden spire, which made it the tallest structure in the world for two hundred years.  The other two towers were also given spires and raised in height. The great spire fell during a windstorm and was not replaced.\n \n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Lincoln Cathedral viewed from Lincoln Castle.jpg| [[Lincoln Cathedral]] (1192-1225)\nFile:Lincoln Cathedral Nave 1, Lincolnshire, UK - Diliff.jpg|The elaborate vaults of the nave were added in the 1ate 12th and 13th century. \n</gallery>\n* '''[[Whitby Abbey]]  and [[Rievaulx Abbey]] ''' The early Gothic style was also used in the reconstruction of several English  [[abbeys]], notably the [[Benedictine]] [[Whitby Abbey]], and the [[Cistercian]] [[Rievaulx Abbey]], which had great importance at the time, though they were both built in secluded areas of the country far from the cites.  Rievaulx Abbey was begun in 1132 in the Romanesque style.  All he monasteries were closed by Henry VIII in 1538, as part of his [[dissolution of monasteries]].

He transformed the country from a small feudal state to the most prosperous and powerful nation in Europe. He was also a great builder, constructing the [[Louvre Palace]] and the first wall around Paris, and founding the [[University of Paris]] (1215). <ref>''Petit Robert Dictipnnaire Universel des Noms Propres'' (1988), pg. 1409 </ref>   The new structures were larger and taller, and their forms were simplified and more balanced. {{Sfn|Mignon (2015|page=20}}  He was succeeded by [[Louis IX of France]], whose reign saw the construction of several great cathedrals, and his own remarkable chapel, [[Sainte-Chapelle]].  <ref>Encyclopaedia Britannica on-line, ''Rayonnant style'',  (retrieved 21 April 2020)</ref>\n\nThe thirteenth-century cathedral style in France is often called [[Rayonnant]]. The objective of the architects was larger windows and more lavish decoration rather than simply greater size.  The mid-level triforium gradually disappeared, and stained glass windows seemed to cover entire walls. The great monuments of the style included [[Amiens Cathedral]], the modified  [[Notre Dame de Paris]], and especially the royal chapel of Louis IX of France, [[Sainte-Chapelle]] (consecrated 1248). <ref>Encyclopaedia Britannica on-line, ''Rayonnant style'',  (retrieved 21 April 2020)</ref>\n\n* ''' [[Chartres Cathedral]] ''' was constructed following the destruction by fire of the Romanesque cathedral in 1194, which left only the crypt, royal total an apse  intact. It was rapidly reconstructed, and was largely finished by 1221. {{Sfn|Mignon (2015)|pages=20-21}}. It surpassed Notre Dame de Paris both in length (130.2 meters) and height (36 meters). It had an immense transept which had its own collateral chapels. The choir was extended by a double disambulatory with three radiating chapels.  Chartres has a number of innovative features.  The traditional level of tribunes on both sides of the nave were removed, thanks to the strength and reach of the flying buttresses, reducing the number of levels from four to three.  This made room for a row of large windows, the same height as the ground-floor arcades, bringing much more light into the church, and a greater sensation of harmony.  Another innovation was the use of the simpler but stronger quadripartite [[rib vault]] instead of the six-part vaults of Notre Dame, which allowed greater height and a simpler arrangement of columns and pillars on the ground floor. {The cathedral was originally planned to have seven towers, but in the end had only two, from different periods.  {{Sfn|Mignon (2015|page=20}}.  Another feature of Chartres was the use of walls painted white or in different colors. As of 2020, after the walls had been cleaned of soot and dirt, these colors are in the processs of being restored or recreated, a measure that has drawn some criticism. <ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/architecture/chartres-cathedral-clean-up-row-experts-divided-over-whether-dirt-should-be-left-in-place-to-keep-a6706627.html|title=Let there be light?

Its nave is 145 meters long and 70 meters wide at the transept. Its elevation copied Chartres in having just three, not four levels, but the plan was very different.  At Amiens the arcades on the ground floor are a full eighteen meters high, equaling the combined height of the triforium and clerestory above.  Amiens adopted the system of stained glass windows in chassis that was used at Reims, but went a step further. The high clerestory windows in the nave are composed of four lancet windows topped by two rosettes, while those in the transept have as many as eight lancets in single window. {{Sfn|Mignon (2015)|page=28}}   \n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:0 Amiens - Cath\u00e9drale Notre-Dame (1).JPG|[[Amiens Cathedral]] (begun 1220)\nFile:Amiens Cathedral choir Wikimedia Commons.jpg|Choir and altar of Amiens Cathedral\n</gallery>\n* '''[[Sainte-Chapelle]]''' (1241-48)  was the royal chapel constructed by [[Louis IX of France]] at his palace on the [[\u00cele de la Cit\u00e9]] in Paris to shelter the relics of the [[Passion of Christ]].

The Romanesque cathedral was destroyed by a fire in 1210. The Archbishop Aubrey de Humbert began a new cathedral in the Gothic style in 1211. The choir was finished in 1241.  Work on the facade did not begin until 1251, and was not finished until the 16th century.  It was heavily damaged in the [[First World War]], but restored  and reconsecrated in 1937. Like Chartres, the elevation has just three levels, giving more space for windows. The traditional tympanum on the facade was replaced by a large rose window, while the sculpture usually on the tympanum was moved to the inside of the facade.  Another innovation at the Reims was the placement of each stained glass windows in a large separate ''chassis'', or frame, rather than directly into the wall, which allowed much more complex patterns.   Another innovation was the placement of statues of angels sheltered in the pinnacles atop the flying buttresses.  In all, Reims has more than 2300 statues in its decoration. {{Sfn|Mignon (2015)|page=26}}  \n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Facade de Notre Dame de Reims.png|Facade of [[Reims Cathedral]] (1211 to the 16th century)\nFile:Reims Cathedrale Notre Dame interior 002.JPG|Western rose window\n</gallery>\n* ''' [[Beauvais Cathedral]] ''' had an unfortunate history.

The cathedrals are notable particularly for their great height, and their extensive use of [[stained glass]] to fill the interiors with light.  They were the tallest and largest buildings of their time, and the most prominent examples of [[Gothic architecture]]. The appearance of the Gothic Cathedral was not only a revolution in architecture;  it also introduced new forms in decoration, sculpture, and art.\n\n[[Cathedrals]] were by definition churches where a [[bishop]] presided.  Abbeys were the churches attached to monasteries.  Many smaller [[parish]] churches were also built in the Gothic style. The appearance of the great cathedrals in the 12th century was a response to the dramatic increase of population and wealth in some parts of Europe, and the need for larger and more imposing buildings.  Technical advances, such an innovative uses of the  [[pointed arch]], [[rib vault]] and [[flying buttress]], allowed the churches and cathedral to become much  taller, stronger, with larger windows and more light.\n\nThe Gothic style first appeared in France at the  [[Abbey of Saint Denis]], near Paris, with the rebuilding of the ambulatory and west facade  of the Abbey church by the Abbot [[Suger]] (1135\u201340).<ref name=\"Laz\u00e9, 2006 p. 36\">Renault and Laz\u00e9, ''Les styles de l'architecture et du mobile'' (2006), p. 36</ref>. The first Gothic cathedral in France,  [[Sens Cathedral]],  was begun between 1135 and 1140, and consecrated in 1164.  <ref>Centre des Monuments Nationaux, ''Le Guide due Patrimoine en France'' (2002), p. 153</ref> \n\nThe style quickly appeared in England, where it was called simply \"The French style.\"   The Choir of [[Canterbury Cathedral]] was destroyed by fire, and was rebuilt by a French master builder from Sens,   [[William of Sens]] between 1174 and 1184.     Other elements of the style were imported from [[Caen]] in Normandy by French Norman architects, who also brought finely-cut stones from Normandy for their construction. \n\n[[Notre Dame de Paris|Notre Dame Cathedral]] was begun in 1163, and consecrated in 1177.<ref name=\"Laz\u00e9, 2006 p. 36\"/>  The later part of the 12th century and beginning of the 13th century saw a more refined style, characterised by [[Chartres Cathedral]], [[Reims Cathedral]], and [[Amiens Cathedral]].  A third period, called ''Rayonnante'' in France, more highly decorated, as characterized by [[Sainte Chapelle]] (1241-1248) and [[Amiens Cathedral]] in France.  The fourth and final period, called ''Flamboyante'', appeared in the second half of the 14th century, taking its name from the flamelike motifs of decoration.  [[Sainte-Chapelle de Vincennes]] (1370), with its walls of stained glass, is a good example.\n\nRenaissance cathedrals and churches gradually replaced Gothic cathedrals, and the original cathedrals, such as Notre Dame, experienced many modifications or fell into ruin.   However, in the mid-19th century, in large part due to the novel ''Notre Dame de Paris'', better known in English as [[The Hunchback of Notre-Dame]], by  [[Victor Hugo]], there was a new wave of interest in the Gothic cathedral. Many Gothic cathedrals and churches were restored, with greater or lesser  accuracy.\n\n==Name==\nThe term [[cathedral]] came from the Greek ''cathedra'', or \"seat\", since it was the official seat of the Bishop, or ''Eveque'', and the principal church of the [[diocese]].   His title came from the Greek term ''Episkopos'', or \"he who sees.\"  As the leader of the [[diocese]]. The Bishop was considered the direct descendant of the [[Apostles]] or disciples of Christ, and had three missions: to direct the affairs of the church within the diocese, to administer the sacraments, and teach the [[Gospels]], or the message of Christ. The Bishop of a cathedral was assisted by the [[Canon (priest)|Canon]]s, or ''Chanoines' in French,   who formed a council called the Chapter.<ref>Mignon, Olivier, ''Architecture des Cath\u00e9drales Gothiques'', (2015), pg. 4</ref>\n\nAt its time, it was called \"The French Style\"   The term \"Gothic\" was a very negative term invented in the late Renaissance by its critics, including the art historian and architect [[Giorgio Vasari]].  They considered the style was barbaric, the opposite of the new Renaissance style that they favored.\n\n== Early Gothic Mid-12th century ==\n===Abbot Suger and the Basilica of Saint Denis===\n \t\nThe Gothic style first appeared in France in the mid-12th century in an [[Abbey]], [[St Denis Basilica]], built by Abbot [[Suger]] (1081-1151).  The old Basilica was the traditional burial place of [[Denis|Saint Denis]], and of the Kings of France, and was also a very popular pilgrimage destination, so much so that pilgrims were sometimes crushed by the crowds.   Suger became the abbot of Saint Denis in 1122.  He became the friend and confident of two French Kings [[Louis VI of France|Louis VI]] and [[Louis VII of France|Louis VII]], and  He served the Regent for Louis VII during the absence of the King for the [[Second Crusade]] (1147-49).  \n \t\nSuger, with the full support of the King, decided to enlarge the church and reconstruct it on a new model.  <ref name = universalis>''Dictionnaire des Architectes'', Encyclopedia Universalis (1999), pp. 659-663</ref>   His first modification was a new west facade, inspired in part by new churches is Normandy,  with two towers and three deep portals.   Each of the portals had a [[tympanum (architecture)|tympanum]] of sculpture, telling a Biblical or inspiring story.  the tympana installed by Sugar depicted the Last Judgement over the main door and the Martyrdom of Saint Denis over the other door.   The tympana  over the east portals became a characteristic feature of later Gothic cathedrals. <ref>Mignon, ''Architecture des Cath\u00e9drale Gothiques'' (205), p. 9</ref> \n\nWhen the new facade was complete, Suger turned his attention to the choir and the ambulatory in the west of thehe Suger was also a scholar of the philosophy of [[Plato]], and he believed thet light was a way by which the faithful could be elevated from the material to the immaterial and the divine. The ambulatory of old church was very dark, since Romanesque architecture, with barrel vaults,  required thick walls and supporting walls  between the small chapels.  Suger decided to use a new form of vault, the [[rib vault]], with [[Pointed arch|pointed arches]], which was higher and stronger.  This allowed him to remove the walls between the chapels, and opened the space for seventy stained glass windows in the choir, filling the church with light. {{Sfn|Mignon|2015|page=9}} \n\nThe new structure was finished and dedicated on 11 June 1144, in the presence of the King. The choir and west front of the Abbey of Saint-Denis both became the prototypes for further building in the royal domain of northern France and in the Duchy of Normandy. Through the rule of the [[House of Plantagenet|Angevin dynasty]], the new style was introduced to England and spread throughout France, the [[Low Countries]], Germany, Spain, northern [[Italy]] and [[Sicily]].This combination of innovations made Saint-Denis the first important example of Gothic architecture;   The church was heavily modified over the following centuries, but the ambulatory and some other original elements remain.<ref>''Le Guide du Patrimoine en France'', Centre des Monuments National, Paris, 2002. \"The Basilica, along with its ''chevet'', constitutes the first masterpiece of Gothic architecture.\" </ref>\n \t\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:StDenis Chorumgang.JPG|The Gothic ambulatory of the [[Basilica of Saint-Denis]] (1140-1144)\t\nFile:Saint-Denis - Fa\u00e7ade.jpg|The west facade of the [[Basilica of Saint-Denis]], after restoration.

Two were built by Suger's personal friends, the bishops of Noyon and Senlis.  The spread of the style was not limited to cathedrals;  it also soon appeared in Abbey churches, at St. Leu d'Esserent in [[Braine, Aisne|Braine]], and, in the province of [[Champagne]], at St. Remy in [[Rheims]] and Notre-Dame in [[Chalons-sur-Marne]].  It also appeared in  simple churches, such as the Gothic church of Saint Quiriace in [[Provins]]  Though each church employed the new style, each had a distinctly different appearance and personality. <ref>O'Reilly, Elizabeth Boyle, ''How France Built Her Cathedrals'', Chapter III.</ref>     \n\n*'''[[Noyon Cathedral]]''' replaced a Romanesque cathedral which burned in 1131. The Bishop of Noyon, Baudouin, used the choir of Saint Denis as his direct model. He used the same masons as Suger, and much of the ornamentation is identical with Saint-Denis. Like many early Gothic churches, the interior has both round and pointed arches, and it has some peculiar Germanic features, such as transepts with rounded ends.  \n\n*'''[[Sens Cathedral]]''', begun in 1133, had a special place among cathedrals in France as the primate of Gaul, ranking of higher authority than Paris, a title it held down the 16th century. It attracted important medieval religious figures including [[Bernard of Clairvaux|Saint Bernard]], [[Abelard]] and [[Thomas Becket]], who came there in 1164 to appeal the Pope for support against [[Henry II of England]].  It was begun as a Romanesque cathedral, but as the walls were rising, the design was changed to Gothic and the proposed groin vaults replaced by [[rib vault|rib vaults]]. It was completed soon after Saint Denis, and is considered the first Gothic Cathedral in France. <ref>Centre des Monuments Nationaux, ''Le Guide due Patrimoine en France'' (2002), p. 153</ref> \n\n* '''[[Senlis Cathedral]]''' begun in 1152, was another very early Gothic cathedral built on the model of Saint-Denis by Bishop Thibaut, who had been at the deathbed of Suger. One distinctive feature is the sculpture in the central western portal, which depicts the Death of the Virgin Mary and her Assumption on the [[lintel]], and her Coronation in the [[tympanum (architecture)|tympanum]].  This arrangement became a common Gothic feature, found at both the north portal of [[Chartres Cathedral]] and the northwest tower of [[Notre Dame de Paris]].   A major fire in 1504 destroyed the upper vaulting of the original cathedral, and now only the apse, the west facade, and the tower have their original appearance; The exterior is now distinctly flamboyant Gothic. <ref>O'Reilly, Chapter III </ref>\n\n* '''[[Laon Cathedral]]''' was begun in about 1160. Like many early Gothic cathedrals, it retained some romanesque features, including tribunes over the side aisles, a use of both round a pointed arches, and a two story chapel on each arm of the transept. Like most early Gothic churches, it was not exceptionally bigh, but it was exceptional long, with eleven bays in the nave, and ten in the choir. Because it was not high, it was possible to build a square tower over the crossing of the transept, in addition to four shorter towers on the corners, each with long lancet openings. One curious feature are the sixteen life-sized sculpted oxen on towers, each under its own canopy, symbolizing the animals which hauled the stones to the site.  <ref>O'Reilly, Chapter III </ref>\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Cath\u00e9drale de Noyon straight.JPG|[[Noyon Cathedral]] (begun about 1150)\nFile:Interior of Cath\u00e9drale Saint-\u00c9tienne de Sens-6974.jpg|Nave of [[Sens Cathedral]] (1140-1164)\nFile:Senlis Cathedral Exterior, Picardy, France - Diliff.jpg| [[Senlis Cathedral]] (1153\u201391): The original 12th-century tower  was crowned with a octagonal tower and spire in the 13th century. \nFile:Laon, Cath\u00e9drale Notre-Dame PM 14294.jpg|Facade of [[Laon Cathedral]] {begun 1160)\n</gallery>\n* '''[[Notre Dame de Paris]]''' begun in 1163 by the archbishop [[Maurice de Sully]], was the largest and highest of the new French cathedrals. The nave was 122 meters long and the vaulted ceiling was 35 meters high, twelve meters higher than Laon Cathedral.  It used the older six-part [[rib vault]] in the ceiling, but replaced the alternating pillars and columns of earlier cathedrals with a single type of pillar, creating greater harmony. It made innovative use of [[flying buttress]] to counterbalance the weight of the higher vaults, so the walls could be thinner and have more windows. It had four levels, like the earlier cathedrals, but the old [[triforium]] was replaced by small rose windows.

While English cathedrals tended to follow the French style, they had a few special charactersics of their own,  Unlike French cathedrals, they tended to great length rather than great height.  They also made extensive of [[Purbeck Marble]]  for columns, floors and wall panels, which added color and reflection to the interiors.

Following a fire in 1174 which destroyed much of the choir, a French master builder, [[William of Sens]], who probably had participated in the construction of [[Sens Cathedral]], was selected to conduct the reconstruction.  It was rebuilt between 1174 and 1184.  William of Sens himself fell fifty feet from the scaffolding and was seriously injured, and had to return to France, where he died in 1180. It was completed by sn English builder, [[William the Englishman]]. <ref>Encylopaedia Britannica on-line edition, \"William of Sens\", retrieved April 19, 2020</ref> While the choir is not as high some French cathedrals, it makes up for the difference by its dramatic length.

Two  [[rose windows]], called the Bishops's Eye and the Dean's Eye, were added at about there same time.   The original cathedral had two towers on the wsst facade, and then  a central tower was built in the 14th century,  topped by a wooden spire, which made it the tallest structure in the world for two hundred years.

He transformed the country from a small feudal state to the most prosperous and powerful nation in Europe. He was also a great builder, constructing the [[Louvre Palace]] and the first wall around Paris, and founding the [[University of Paris]] (1215). <ref>''Petit Robert Dictipnnaire Universel des Noms Propres'' (1988), pg. 1409 </ref>   The new structures were larger and taller, and their forms were simplified and more balanced. {{Sfn|Mignon (2015|page=20}}  He was succeeded by [[Louis IX of France]], whose reign saw the construction of several great cathedrals, and his own remarkable chapel, [[Sainte-Chapelle]].  <ref>Encyclopaedia Britannica on-line, ''Rayonnant style'',  (retrieved 21 April 2020)</ref>\n\nThe thirteenth-century cathedral style in France is often called [[Rayonnant]]. The objective of the architects was larger windows and more lavish decoration rather than simply greater size.  The mid-level triforium gradually disappeared, and stained glass windows seemed to cover entire walls. The great monuments of the style included [[Amiens Cathedral]], the modified  [[Notre Dame de Paris]], and especially the royal chapel of Louis IX of France, [[Sainte-Chapelle]] (consecrated 1248). <ref>Encyclopaedia Britannica on-line, ''Rayonnant style'',  (retrieved 21 April 2020)</ref>\n\n* ''' [[Chartres Cathedral]] ''' was constructed following the destruction by fire of the Romanesque cathedral in 1194, which left only the crypt, royal total an apse  intact. It was rapidly reconstructed, and was largely finished by 1221. {{Sfn|Mignon (2015)|pages=20-21}}. It surpassed Notre Dame de Paris both in length (130.2 meters) and height (36 meters). It had an immense transept which had its own collateral chapels. The choir was extended by a double disambulatory with three radiating chapels.  Chartres has a number of innovative features.  The traditional level of tribunes on both sides of the nave were removed, thanks to the strength and reach of the flying buttresses, reducing the number of levels from four to three.  This made room for a row of large windows, the same height as the ground-floor arcades, bringing much more light into the church, and a greater sensation of harmony.  Another innovation was the use of the simpler but stronger quadripartite [[rib vault]] instead of the six-part vaults of Notre Dame, which allowed greater height and a simpler arrangement of columns and pillars on the ground floor. {The cathedral was originally planned to have seven towers, but in the end had only two, from different periods.  {{Sfn|Mignon (2015|page=20}}.  Another feature of Chartres was the use of walls painted white or in different colors. As of 2020, after the walls had been cleaned of soot and dirt, these colors are in the processs of being restored or recreated, a measure that has drawn some criticism. <ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/architecture/chartres-cathedral-clean-up-row-experts-divided-over-whether-dirt-should-be-left-in-place-to-keep-a6706627.html|title=Let there be light?

At Amiens the arcades on the ground floor are a full eighteen meters high, equaling the combined height of the triforium and clerestory above.  Amiens adopted the system of stained glass windows in chassis that was used at Reims, but went a step further. The high clerestory windows in the nave are composed of four lancet windows topped by two rosettes, while those in the transept have as many as eight lancets in single window. {{Sfn|Mignon (2015)|page=28}}   \n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:0 Amiens - Cath\u00e9drale Notre-Dame (1).JPG|[[Amiens Cathedral]] (begun 1220)\nFile:Amiens Cathedral choir Wikimedia Commons.jpg|Choir and altar of Amiens Cathedral\n</gallery>\n* '''[[Sainte-Chapelle]]''' (1241-48)  was the royal chapel constructed by [[Louis IX of France]] at his palace on the [[\u00cele de la Cit\u00e9]] in Paris to shelter the relics of the [[Passion of Christ]].

Work on the facade did not begin until 1251, and was not finished until the 16th century.  It was heavily damaged in the [[First World War]], but restored  and reconsecrated in 1937. Like Chartres, the elevation has just three levels, giving more space for windows. The traditional tympanum on the facade was replaced by a large rose window, while the sculpture usually on the tympanum was moved to the inside of the facade.  Another innovation at the Reims was the placement of each stained glass windows in a large separate ''chassis'', or frame, rather than directly into the wall, which allowed much more complex patterns.   Another innovation was the placement of statues of angels sheltered in the pinnacles atop the flying buttresses.  In all, Reims has more than 2300 statues in its decoration. {{Sfn|Mignon (2015)|page=26}}  \n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Facade de Notre Dame de Reims.png|Facade of [[Reims Cathedral]] (1211 to the 16th century)\nFile:Reims Cathedrale Notre Dame interior 002.JPG|Western rose window\n</gallery>\n* ''' [[Beauvais Cathedral]] ''' had an unfortunate history.

The south transept was completed first, then the nave, completed in 1275. They built on top of the original Romanesque foundations, which accounts for the unusual wide spacing of the pillars of the grand arcades.
