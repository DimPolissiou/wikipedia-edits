Status sometimes comes with attendant rights, duties, and lifestyle practices.\n\nIn modern societies, [[profession|occupation]] is usually thought of as the main determinant of status, but other memberships or affiliations (such as [[ethnic group]], [[religion]], [[gender]], voluntary associations, [[fandom]], [[hobby]]) can have an influence.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.virginia.edu/topnews/textonlyarchive/September_1996/nerd.txt |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-04-30 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071027083043/http://www.virginia.edu/topnews/textonlyarchive/September_1996/nerd.txt |archivedate=2007-10-27 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |title=The Effect of Middle School Extra Curricular Activities on Adolescents' Popularity and Peer Status \u2013 EDER and KINNEY 26 (3): 298 \u2013 Youth & Society |journal=Youth & Society |volume=26 |issue=3 |pages=298\u2013324 |date=1995-03-01 |df= |doi=10.1177/0044118X95026003002 |last1=Eder |first1=Donna |last2=Kinney |first2=David A. }}</ref> [[Achieved status]], when people are placed in the stratification structure based on their individual merits or achievements, is thought to be reflective of modern developed societies. This image status can be achieved, for instance, through education, occupation, and marital status. Their place within the stratification structure is determined by society's standards, which often judges them on success in matching important values, like political power, academic acumen, and financial wealth.\n\nIn pre-modern societies, status differentiation is widely varied. In some cases it can be quite rigid, such as with the [[India]]n [[caste]] system. In other cases, status exists without class and/or informally, as is true with some [[Hunter-Gatherer]] societies such as the [[Khoisan]], and some [[Indigenous Australians|Indigenous Australian]] societies. In these cases, status is limited to specific personal relationships. For example, a [[Khoisan]] man is expected to take his wife's mother quite seriously (a non-joking relationship), although the mother-in-law has no special \"status\" over anyone except her son-in-law\u2014and only then in specific contexts.\n\nStatus maintains and stabilizes [[social stratification]]. Mere inequality in resources and privileges is likely to be perceived as unfair and thus prompt retaliation and resistance from those of lower status, but if some individuals are seen as better than others (i.e., have higher status), then it seems natural and fair that high-status people receive more resources and privileges.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ridgeway|first=Cecilia|date=2014|title=Why status matters for inequality|url=http://inequality.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/Cecilia%20L.%20Ridgeway%20-Why%20Status%20Matters%20for%20Inequality.pdf|journal=American Sociological Review|volume=79|pages=1\u201316|via=|doi=10.1177/0003122413515997}}</ref> Historically, [[Max Weber]] distinguished status from [[social class]],<ref>Weber, Max. 1946. \"Class, Status, Party.\" pp. 180\u201395 in From Max Weber: Essays in Sociology, H.

For example, a [[teacher]] may have a positive societal image (respect, prestige) which increases their status but may earn little [[money]], which simultaneously decreases their status.\n\n== Inborn and acquired ==\n[[File:Inquilinos.gif|thumb|right|250px|Social status is often associated with clothing and possessions. Compare the foreman with a horse and high hat with the [[inquilino]] in picture. Image from 19th century rural Chile.]]\nStatuses such as those based on inborn characteristics, such as ethnicity or royal heritage, are called [[ascribed status]]es. A [[Social stigma|stigma]] (such as a physical deformity or mental illness) can also be an attribute a person has possessed since birth, but stigmas can also be acquired later in life.<ref name=\":0\" /> Either way, stigmas generally result in lower status if known to others.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n== Social mobility ==\nStatus can be changed through a process of [[social mobility]] wherein a person changes position within the stratification system. A move in social standing can be upward (upward mobility), or downward (downward mobility). Social mobility is more frequent in societies where achievement rather than ascription is valued.\n\n== Social stratification ==\n{{Main|Social stratification}}\nSocial stratification describes the way people are placed or \"stratified\" in society.  It is associated with the ability of individuals to live up to some set of ideals or principles regarded as important by the society or a subculture within it. The members of a social group interact mainly within their own group and to a lesser degree with those of higher or lower status in a recognized system of social stratification.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=McPherson|first=Miller|last2=Smith-Lovin|first2=Lynn|last3=Cook|first3=James M|date=2001-08-01|title=Birds of a Feather: Homophily in Social Networks|journal=Annual Review of Sociology|volume=27|issue=1|pages=415\u2013444|doi=10.1146/annurev.soc.27.1.415|issn=0360-0572|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/312048ca4295d3639dce516f4691c116afda0e5d}}</ref> Some of the more common bases for such stratification include:\n\nGroups:\n* [[Wealth]]/[[Income]] (most common): Ties between persons with the same personal income\n* [[Gender]]: Ties between persons of the same sex and sexuality\n* Political status: Ties between persons of the same political views/status\n* [[Religion]]: Ties between persons of the same religion\n* [[Race (human classification)|Race]]/[[Ethnicity]]: Ties between persons of the same ethnic/racial group\n* [[Social class]]: Ties between persons born into the same economic group\n* [[Coolness]]: Ties between persons who have similar levels of [[popularity]]\n\n== Max Weber's three dimensions of stratification ==\n{{Main|Three-component theory of stratification}}\nThe German sociologist [[Max Weber]] developed a theory proposing that stratification is based on three factors that have become known as \"the three p's of stratification\": [[property]], prestige and [[Power (sociology)|power]]. He claimed that [[social stratification]] is a result of the interaction of wealth (class), prestige status (or in German ''Stand'') and power (party).<ref>Tony Waters and Dagmar Waters, translators and eds., (2015).  Weber's Rationalism and Modern Society.  Palgrave Macmillan.</ref>\n* [[Reputation|Prestige]] is a significant factor in determining one's place in the stratification system. The ownership of property is not always going to assure power, but there are frequently people with prestige and little property.\n* [[Property]] refers to one's material possessions and their life chances. If someone has control of property, that person has power over others and can use the property to his or her own benefit.\n* [[Power (social and political)|Power]] is the ability to do what one wants, regardless of the will of others. (Domination, a closely related concept, is the power to make others' behavior conform to one's commands). This refers to two different types of power, which are possession of power and exercising power. For example, some people in charge of the government have an immense amount of power, and yet they do not make much money.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}} \nMax Weber developed various ways that societies are organized in hierarchical systems of power. These ways are social status, class power and political power.\n* Class Power: This refers to unequal access to resources. If you have access to something that someone else needs, that can make you more powerful than the person in need. The person with the resource thus has bargaining power over the other.\n* Social Status (Social Power): If you view someone as a social superior, that person will have power over you because you believe that person has a higher status than you do.\n* Political Power: Political power can influence the hierarchical system of power because those that can influence what laws are passed and how they are applied can exercise power over others.\nThere has been discussion about how Weber's three dimensions of stratification are more useful for specifying social inequality than more traditional terms like [[Socioeconomic Status]].<ref>Waters, Tony and Dagmar Waters 2016 Are the terms \"socio-economic status\" and \"social status\" a warped form of reasoning for Max Weber?\" Palgrave Communications 2, Article number: 16002 (2016) {{cite journal |title=Are the terms \"socio-economic status\" and \"class status\" a warped form of reasoning for Max Weber? |journal=Palgrave Communications |volume=2 |df= |doi=10.1057/palcomms.2016.2 |year=2016 |last1=Waters |first1=Tony |last2=Waters |first2=Dagmar |doi-access=free }}</ref>\n\n=== Status group ===\n{{Main|Status group}}\n[[Max Weber]] developed the idea of \"status group\" which is a translation of the German ''Stand'' (pl. ''St\u00e4nde''). Status groups are communities that are based on ideas of lifestyles and the honor the status group both asserts, and is given by others. Status groups exist in the context of beliefs about relative prestige, privilege, and honor and can be of both a positive and negative sort. People in status groups are only supposed to engage with people of like status, and in particular, marriage inside or outside the group is discouraged.  Status groups can include professions, club-like organizations, ethnicity, race, and other groups for which pattern association.<ref>Weber 48-56</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Society}}\n{{Columns-list|colwidth=22em|\n* [[Achieved status]]\n* [[Ascribed status]]\n* [[Dominance hierarchy]]\n* [[Economic mobility]]\n* [[Expressions of dominance]]\n* [[Occupational_prestige]]\n* [[Power (social and political)]]\n* [[Ranked society]]\n* [[Social class]]\n* [[Social inequality]]\n* [[Social stratification]]\n* [[Socioeconomic status]]\n* [[Sociometric status]]\n* [[Status attainment]]\n* [[Status set]]\n* [[Status symbol]]\n}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n{{wikiquote|Rank}}\n* Botton, Alain De (2004), ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=83ZCBa9hXLQC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false Status Anxiety]'', Hamish Hamilton\n* Michael Marmot (2004), ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=Qbz9NfYdg6UC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false The Status Syndrome: How Social Standing Affects Our Health and Longevity]'', Times Books\n* Social status.

Status sometimes comes with attendant rights, duties, and lifestyle practices.\n\nIn modern societies, [[profession|occupation]] is usually thought of as the main determinant of status, but other memberships or affiliations (such as [[ethnic group]], [[religion]], [[gender]], voluntary associations, [[fandom]], [[hobby]]) can have an influence.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.virginia.edu/topnews/textonlyarchive/September_1996/nerd.txt |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-04-30 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071027083043/http://www.virginia.edu/topnews/textonlyarchive/September_1996/nerd.txt |archivedate=2007-10-27 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |title=The Effect of Middle School Extra Curricular Activities on Adolescents' Popularity and Peer Status \u2013 EDER and KINNEY 26 (3): 298 \u2013 Youth & Society |journal=Youth & Society |volume=26 |issue=3 |pages=298\u2013324 |date=1995-03-01 |df= |doi=10.1177/0044118X95026003002 |last1=Eder |first1=Donna |last2=Kinney |first2=David A. }}</ref> [[Achieved status]], when people are placed in the stratification structure based on their individual merits or achievements, is thought to be reflective of modern developed societies. This image status can be achieved, for instance, through education, occupation, and marital status. Their place within the stratification structure is determined by society's standards, which often judges them on success in matching important values, like political power, academic acumen, and financial wealth.\n\nIn pre-modern societies, status differentiation is widely varied. In some cases it can be quite rigid, such as with the [[India]]n [[caste]] system. In other cases, status exists without class and/or informally, as is true with some [[Hunter-Gatherer]] societies such as the [[Khoisan]], and some [[Indigenous Australians|Indigenous Australian]] societies. In these cases, status is limited to specific personal relationships. For example, a [[Khoisan]] man is expected to take his wife's mother quite seriously (a non-joking relationship), although the mother-in-law has no special \"status\" over anyone except her son-in-law\u2014and only then in specific contexts.\n\nStatus maintains and stabilizes [[social stratification]]. Mere inequality in resources and privileges is likely to be perceived as unfair and thus prompt retaliation and resistance from those of lower status, but if some individuals are seen as better than others (i.e., have higher status), then it seems natural and fair that high-status people receive more resources and privileges.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ridgeway|first=Cecilia|date=2014|title=Why status matters for inequality|url=http://inequality.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/Cecilia%20L.%20Ridgeway%20-Why%20Status%20Matters%20for%20Inequality.pdf|journal=American Sociological Review|volume=79|pages=1\u201316|via=|doi=10.1177/0003122413515997}}</ref> Historically, [[Max Weber]] distinguished status from [[social class]],<ref>Weber, Max. 1946. \"Class, Status, Party.\" pp. 180\u201395 in From Max Weber: Essays in Sociology, H.

For example, a [[teacher]] may have a positive societal image (respect, prestige) which increases their status but may earn little [[money]], which simultaneously decreases their status.\n\n== Inborn and acquired ==\n[[File:Inquilinos.gif|thumb|right|250px|Social status is often associated with clothing and possessions. Compare the foreman with a horse and high hat with the [[inquilino]] in picture.

A [[Social stigma|stigma]] (such as a physical deformity or mental illness) can also be an attribute a person has possessed since birth, but stigmas can also be acquired later in life.<ref name=\":0\" /> Either way, stigmas generally result in lower status if known to others.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n== Social mobility ==\nStatus can be changed through a process of [[social mobility]] wherein a person changes position within the stratification system. A move in social standing can be upward (upward mobility), or downward (downward mobility). Social mobility is more frequent in societies where achievement rather than ascription is valued.\n\n== Social stratification ==\n{{Main|Social stratification}}\nSocial stratification describes the way people are placed or \"stratified\" in society.  It is associated with the ability of individuals to live up to some set of ideals or principles regarded as important by the society or a subculture within it. The members of a social group interact mainly within their own group and to a lesser degree with those of higher or lower status in a recognized system of social stratification.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=McPherson|first=Miller|last2=Smith-Lovin|first2=Lynn|last3=Cook|first3=James M|date=2001-08-01|title=Birds of a Feather: Homophily in Social Networks|journal=Annual Review of Sociology|volume=27|issue=1|pages=415\u2013444|doi=10.1146/annurev.soc.27.1.415|issn=0360-0572|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/312048ca4295d3639dce516f4691c116afda0e5d}}</ref> Some of the more common bases for such stratification include:\n\nGroups:\n* [[Wealth]]/[[Income]] (most common): Ties between persons with the same personal income\n* [[Gender]]: Ties between persons of the same sex and sexuality\n* Political status: Ties between persons of the same political views/status\n* [[Religion]]: Ties between persons of the same religion\n* [[Race (human classification)|Race]]/[[Ethnicity]]: Ties between persons of the same ethnic/racial group\n* [[Social class]]: Ties between persons born into the same economic group\n* [[Coolness]]: Ties between persons who have similar levels of [[popularity]]\n\n== Max Weber's three dimensions of stratification ==\n{{Main|Three-component theory of stratification}}\nThe German sociologist [[Max Weber]] developed a theory proposing that stratification is based on three factors that have become known as \"the three p's of stratification\": [[property]], prestige and [[Power (sociology)|power]]. He claimed that [[social stratification]] is a result of the interaction of wealth (class), prestige status (or in German ''Stand'') and power (party).<ref>Tony Waters and Dagmar Waters, translators and eds., (2015).  Weber's Rationalism and Modern Society.  Palgrave Macmillan.</ref>\n* [[Reputation|Prestige]] is a significant factor in determining one's place in the stratification system. The ownership of property is not always going to assure power, but there are frequently people with prestige and little property.\n* [[Property]] refers to one's material possessions and their life chances. If someone has control of property, that person has power over others and can use the property to his or her own benefit.\n* [[Power (social and political)|Power]] is the ability to do what one wants, regardless of the will of others. (Domination, a closely related concept, is the power to make others' behavior conform to one's commands). This refers to two different types of power, which are possession of power and exercising power. For example, some people in charge of the government have an immense amount of power, and yet they do not make much money.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}} \nMax Weber developed various ways that societies are organized in hierarchical systems of power. These ways are social status, class power and political power.\n* Class Power: This refers to unequal access to resources. If you have access to something that someone else needs, that can make you more powerful than the person in need. The person with the resource thus has bargaining power over the other.\n* Social Status (Social Power): If you view someone as a social superior, that person will have power over you because you believe that person has a higher status than you do.\n* Political Power: Political power can influence the hierarchical system of power because those that can influence what laws are passed and how they are applied can exercise power over others.\nThere has been discussion about how Weber's three dimensions of stratification are more useful for specifying social inequality than more traditional terms like [[Socioeconomic Status]].<ref>Waters, Tony and Dagmar Waters 2016 Are the terms \"socio-economic status\" and \"social status\" a warped form of reasoning for Max Weber?\" Palgrave Communications 2, Article number: 16002 (2016) {{cite journal |title=Are the terms \"socio-economic status\" and \"class status\" a warped form of reasoning for Max Weber? |journal=Palgrave Communications |volume=2 |df= |doi=10.1057/palcomms.2016.2 |year=2016 |last1=Waters |first1=Tony |last2=Waters |first2=Dagmar |doi-access=free }}</ref>\n\n=== Status group ===\n{{Main|Status group}}\n[[Max Weber]] developed the idea of \"status group\" which is a translation of the German ''Stand'' (pl. ''St\u00e4nde''). Status groups are communities that are based on ideas of lifestyles and the honor the status group both asserts, and is given by others. Status groups exist in the context of beliefs about relative prestige, privilege, and honor and can be of both a positive and negative sort. People in status groups are only supposed to engage with people of like status, and in particular, marriage inside or outside the group is discouraged.  Status groups can include professions, club-like organizations, ethnicity, race, and other groups for which pattern association.<ref>Weber 48-56</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Society}}\n{{Columns-list|colwidth=22em|\n* [[Achieved status]]\n* [[Ascribed status]]\n* [[Dominance hierarchy]]\n* [[Economic mobility]]\n* [[Expressions of dominance]]\n* [[Occupational_prestige]]\n* [[Power (social and political)]]\n* [[Ranked society]]\n* [[Social class]]\n* [[Social inequality]]\n* [[Social stratification]]\n* [[Socioeconomic status]]\n* [[Sociometric status]]\n* [[Status attainment]]\n* [[Status set]]\n* [[Status symbol]]\n}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n{{wikiquote|Rank}}\n* Botton, Alain De (2004), ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=83ZCBa9hXLQC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false Status Anxiety]'', Hamish Hamilton\n* Michael Marmot (2004), ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=Qbz9NfYdg6UC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false The Status Syndrome: How Social Standing Affects Our Health and Longevity]'', Times Books\n* Social status.

A student is referred by their home school, challenge-class teacher, gifted case manager, or parent for consideration for admission. Students are given a cognitive test which gives the selection committee a deeper understanding of a student's intellectual abilities. After that, students who are seen as potential, gifted candidates are invited to spend one or two days in the classroom at the school they would potentially attend. Offers of admission are sometimes contingent on this final step.<ref name=\"Vancouver\" /> The MACC program, despite its various permutations, universally emphasizes the creation of lifelong, autonomous learners who seek knowledge in an active and dynamic learning environment clustered with other high-ability learners. In addition, many MACC graduates have gone on to national and international success, including [[Brian Wong]], twice nominated as a member of [[Forbes 30 Under 30|Top 30 Under 30]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.vancitybuzz.com/2014/02/startup-grind-hosts-22-year-old-forbes-top-30-30-winner-brian-wong/|title=Startup Grind Hosts 22-year-old Forbes Top 30 under 30 winner: Brian Wong - Vancity Buzz|date=2014-02-28|work=Vancity Buzz|access-date=2017-12-02|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nTeachers are chosen based on experience, ideally with course-work, training and/or experience working with high-ability learners. Many teachers have received national recognition for their accomplishments while working in MACC. Most notably, the former Tecumseh MACC teacher, Ms. Marie Chomyn, who received the Prime Minister's Award for Teaching Excellence in 2012,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/pmate-ppmee.nsf/eng/wz01903.html|title=Archived \u2014 Marie Chomyn|last=Telecommunications|first=Government of Canada, Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada, Office of the Deputy Minister, Spectrum, Information Technologies and|website=www.ic.gc.ca|language=en|access-date=2018-07-16}}</ref> as well as 2013 Governor General Award co-recipients and former MACC teachers Ms. Graeme Cotton and Ms. Romy Cooper for their contributions to the teaching of issues related to national heritage.

They are all administered by the [[Vancouver School Board]].<ref name=\"Vancouver\" />  \n* [[Vancouver School Board|Tecumseh Elementary School]] offers the MACC program to students in Grades 5, 6 and 7, and is taught by Ms. Coit.<ref name=\":0\" />\n* [[Sir William Osler Elementary School]] hosts two classes - a grade 4 and 5 split taught by Mr. Webb and a grade 6 and 7 split taught by Ms. Tayler.<ref name=\":0\" /> \n* Additionally, [[Vancouver School Board|Kerrisdale Elementary School]] hosts the only French Immersion program, taught by Mme. Peddle. It is a grade 5, 6 and 7 split. It was previously at [[General Gordon Elementary School]], but was relocated due to seismic upgrades.<ref name=\":0\" /><!-- Can't seem to find out how to cite a PDF: here's the source of the seismic upgrades - http://www.gordonelementary.ca/sites/default/files/Gordon_School_Plan_2014_2015_final.pdf -->\n\nThere were previous incarnations of MACC at [[Lord Nelson Elementary School]], [[Queen Mary Elementary School]], and [[David Livingstone Elementary School]], but the program has shrunk slightly and relocated to its current base schools over the years due to a combination of [[Vancouver School Board|VSB]] funding cuts, seismic upgrades, and perceived population shifts. In addition, there are other MACC programs outside Vancouver, such as Berkshire Park Elementary School, Hyland Elementary School, Bayridge Elementary School and Crescent Park Elementary School, all of which are located in [[Surrey, British Columbia|Surrey]].<ref name=\"Surrey\" /> All four Surrey programs are Grades 5\u20137. Surrey is currently in consideration of adding a high school program. In Vancouver, there also used to be a high school MACC program at [[Kitsilano Secondary School]], though in Vancouver the concept has evolved into the 'Mini-School', of which most MACC graduates attend. The [[Tri-Cities (British Columbia)|Tri-Cities]] (Port Coquitlam, Coquitlam, Port Moody) has three MACC equipped schools, namely Citadel Middle School, Hillcrest Middle School, and Kwayhquitlum Middle School.<ref name=\"Coquitlam\" /> In 2014, two MACC sites were added in Burnaby (School District 41) at [[Capitol Hill Elementary School]] and Suncrest Elementary. Both of these schools have a grade 4/5 and 6/7 class.<ref name=\"Burnaby\" /> There is also a Mini-School program located at [[Alpha Secondary School]].\n\n==The Four Pillars (Curriculum)==\nThe MACC curriculum places emphasis on Four Main Pillars: Autonomous Learning, Numeracy, Literacy, and Project Based Learning. Report cards are often structured around these 4 categories,<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=http://go.vsb.bc.ca/schools/specialneeds/Programs/gifted/Pages/gifted-enrichment.aspx|title=Gifted Enrichment Programs|website=go.vsb.bc.ca|language=en-us|access-date=2017-12-02}}</ref> with subcategories such as Work Habits, Personal Responsibility, Active Learning, and Social Responsibility.\n\n===Autonomous Learning===\nThe word [[autonomous]] means to be independent, self-governing, efficient and to be able to learn by yourself and be a self-motivated learner.  This is a very important life-skill that is heavily emphasized in this program.  The students need to be autonomous, as they are not always reminded of due dates, or to take notes for their projects. This flexible learning style works well for self-motivated, creative, and independent students because it allows them to set their own goals and manage their own time. This benefits students because this teaches students how to become leaders in their own learning. The learning system quite different from the regular system because students run at their own pace, which means that everyone in the class can be in stronger in different areas of learning.\n\n===Numeracy===\nIn the MACC program, students work on self-paced math curriculum work in addition to problem-solving and math contests. This allows for accelerated math learning, and many students are known for going 1, 2 or 3 years beyond their grade level in math. More emphasis is placed on problem-solving to promote critical thinking skills. Some classes have 'individual math work' but in small groups where everyone's skill is more or less the same. Teachers believe that in doing so, this will bring up a lot of interesting math discussion, which they believe is useful in learning math. Also, because of all the work MACC students spend on problem-solving math, MACC students tend to score high in math competitions.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.vsb.bc.ca/district-news/macc-class-students-impress-national-math-tournament-and-local-history-evening|title=MACC Class Students Impress at National Math Tournament and Local History Evening {{!}} Vancouver School Board|website=www.vsb.bc.ca|language=en|access-date=2017-12-02}}</ref> In 2016, 3 Kwayhquitlum students and 1 Tecumseh student 'aced' the Grade 7 Gauss contest by scoring a perfect 150.\n\n===Literacy===\nThe MACC Program offers a variety of different literacy activities, including novel studies, poem analysis, essay writing, persuasive writing, story writing, graphic novel writing, report writing, play writing, and many others. Many of these are for preparation for high school, writing reports for Science Fair,<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.vsb.bc.ca/district-news/annual-science-fair-districts-gifted-learners-program|title=Annual science fair for district's gifted learners program {{!}} Vancouver School Board|website=www.vsb.bc.ca|language=en|access-date=2017-12-02}}</ref> Heritage Fair,<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.vsb.bc.ca/district-news/macc-students-celebrate-heritage-fair-learning-tecumseh|title=MACC Students Celebrate Heritage Fair Learning at Tecumseh {{!}} Vancouver School Board|website=www.vsb.bc.ca|language=en|access-date=2017-12-02}}</ref> and EOE (Evening of Eminence)<ref name=\":4\" /> projects.\n\n===Project-Based Learning===\nIn Project-Based Learning, students explore learning through three main projects each year. These include a Science Fair or Heritage fair project, an EOE, individual or partner research projects, or group drama projects. These projects are usually the biggest thing that students will do while in MACC. However, the Heritage Fair has not always been done in some classes, such as at Hillcrest Middle school. The Science Fair is based on a typical science fair, but students are encouraged to go 'above and beyond',<ref name=\":2\" /> and explore in-depth scientific research questions and experiments. For Heritage Fair, students explore major events in Canadian History and compete in the Canadian Heritage Fair.<ref name=\":3\" /> In 2016, the FI MACC class was honored to created a class Heritage Fair event, about the 100th anniversary of [[Battle of Vimy Ridge|The Battle of Vimy Ridge]], as well as explore the 'birth of Canada'.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.vsb.bc.ca/district-news/kerrisdale%E2%80%99s-macc-program-honours-vimy-ridge-anniversary|title=Kerrisdale\u2019s MACC program honours Vimy Ridge anniversary {{!}} Vancouver School Board|website=www.vsb.bc.ca|language=en|access-date=2017-12-02}}</ref> EOE,<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.vsb.bc.ca/district-news/eminent-historical-characters-pay-visit-museum-vancouver|title=Eminent Historical Characters Pay a Visit to the Museum of Vancouver {{!}} Vancouver School Board|website=www.vsb.bc.ca|language=en|access-date=2017-12-02}}</ref> students decide on an Eminent person to portray, based on the five criteria for an eminent person - Distinct, Distinguished, Determined, Influential and has Integrity - the 3 'D's and 2 'I's. The students end this project with a museum display, usually hosted at the [http://www.museumofvancouver.ca/ MOV] or the [http://www.musqueam.bc.ca/musqueam-cultural-centre-gallery Musqueam Cultural Centre] where they pose as their Eminent person. Many MACC classes also participate in the annual [[Let's Talk Science]] competition at U.B.C., and Surrey teams from Crescent Park and Berkshire Park have won the competition five times since 2010.\n\n==Individualized Education Plan (IEP)==\nIn the MACC program, each student, along with their parents and teachers, personalizes their goals in his/her [[Individualized Education Program|IEP]]. While similar in some aspects to a regular IEP, it is modified to summarize the students' objectives in the four pillars of the MACC program: Literacy, Numeracy, Autonomous Learning and Project-Based Learning. Unlike regular report cards, MACC students' report cards include what the students have done to achieve these goals.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n==See also==\n*[[Vancouver School Board]]\n*[[Surrey School Board]]\n*[[Tecumseh Elementary School]]\n*[[Kerrisdale Elementary School]]\n*[[Sir William Osler Elementary School]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*http://letstalkscience.ca/Programs/Lets-Talk-Science-Challenge\n*https://www.surreyschools.ca/schools/berkshirepark/Pages/default.aspx\n*http://berkshireparkmacc.blogspot.com/\n*https://web.archive.org/web/20111127021702/http://fcweb.sd36.bc.ca/~mcknight_l/?OpenItemURL=S0B2AA234\n*https://web.archive.org/web/20120508054156/http://www.vsb.bc.ca/programs/macc-multi-age-cluster-class\n*https://web.archive.org/web/20111120232104/http://vsb.bc.ca/sites/default/files/school-files/Programs/VSB_Programs_GiftedEducation.pdf\n*http://go.vsb.bc.ca/schools/queenmary/Programs/Pages/MACC-%28Gifted-Education%29.aspx\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:MACC (Multi Age Cluster Class)}}\n[[Category:Gifted education|Multi Age Cluster Class]]\n", "text_old": "The '''Multi-Age Cluster Class''' or '''Middle Age Cluster Class''' (abbreviated MACC) is a gifted education program based in [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]], [[Canada]].<ref name=\"Vancouver\">{{cite web|url=https://www.vsb.bc.ca/Student_Support/Learning_Support_Services/gifted/macc/Pages/Default.aspx|title=Multi Age Cluster Class|access-date=April 14, 2020}}</ref> The MACC program has extended to several more schools located in the Greater Vancouver Regional District, namely; [[Burnaby]],<ref name=\"Burnaby\">{{cite web|url=https://burnabyschools.ca/multi-age-cluster-class|title=Multi-Age Cluster Class|access-date=April 14, 2020}}</ref> [[Surrey, British Columbia|Surrey]],<ref name=\"Surrey\">{{cite web|url=https://www.surreyschools.ca/EducationalPrograms/Pages/MACC.aspx|title=Multi-Age Cluster Class (MACC)|access-date=April 14, 2020}}</ref> [[Coquitlam]], [[Port Coquitlam]] and [[Port Moody]]<ref name=\"Coquitlam\">{{cite web|url=https://www.sd43.bc.ca/Programs/gifted/Pages/MACC.aspx#/=|title=SD43 Middle Age Cluster Classes (MACC)|access-date=April 14, 2020}}</ref>.

Most notably, the former Tecumseh MACC teacher, Ms. Marie Chomyn, who received the Prime Minister's Award for Teaching Excellence in 2012,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/pmate-ppmee.nsf/eng/wz01903.html|title=Archived \u2014 Marie Chomyn|last=Telecommunications|first=Government of Canada, Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada, Office of the Deputy Minister, Spectrum, Information Technologies and|website=www.ic.gc.ca|language=en|access-date=2018-07-16}}</ref> as well as 2013 Governor General Award co-recipients and former MACC teachers Ms. Graeme Cotton and Ms. Romy Cooper for their contributions to the teaching of issues related to national heritage. The current MACC teachers are Ms. Coit, Ms. Tayler, Mr. Webb and Madame Peddle<!-- I am a personal friend of Madame Barber, and I know she is no longer a MACC teacher... but, I cannot find the name of the teacher that replaced her. -->.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.vsb.bc.ca/programs/macc-multi-age-cluster-class|title=MACC - Multi-Age Cluster Class|website=Vancouver School Board}}</ref>\n\n==Location==\nCurrently, there are 3 schools hosting the MACC program in Vancouver. They are all administered by the [[Vancouver School Board]].<ref name=\"Vancouver\" />  \n* [[Vancouver School Board|Tecumseh Elementary School]] offers the MACC program to students in Grades 5, 6 and 7, and is taught by Ms. Coit.<ref name=\":0\" />\n* [[Sir William Osler Elementary School]] hosts two classes - a grade 4 and 5 split taught by Mr. Webb and a grade 6 and 7 split taught by Ms. Tayler.<ref name=\":0\" /> \n* Additionally, [[Vancouver School Board|Kerrisdale Elementary School]] hosts the only French Immersion program, taught by Mme. Peddle. It is a grade 5, 6 and 7 split. It was previously at [[General Gordon Elementary School]], but was relocated due to seismic upgrades.<ref name=\":0\" /><!-- Can't seem to find out how to cite a PDF: here's the source of the seismic upgrades - http://www.gordonelementary.ca/sites/default/files/Gordon_School_Plan_2014_2015_final.pdf -->\n\nThere were previous incarnations of MACC at [[Lord Nelson Elementary School]], [[Queen Mary Elementary School]], and [[David Livingstone Elementary School]], but the program has shrunk slightly and relocated to its current base schools over the years due to a combination of [[Vancouver School Board|VSB]] funding cuts, seismic upgrades, and perceived population shifts. In addition, there are other MACC programs outside Vancouver, such as Berkshire Park Elementary School, Hyland Elementary School, Bayridge Elementary School and Crescent Park Elementary School, all of which are located in [[Surrey, British Columbia|Surrey]].<ref name=\"Surrey\" /> All four Surrey programs are Grades 5\u20137. Surrey is currently in consideration of adding a high school program. In Vancouver, there also used to be a high school MACC program at [[Kitsilano Secondary School]], though in Vancouver the concept has evolved into the 'Mini-School', of which most MACC graduates attend. The [[Tri-Cities (British Columbia)|Tri-Cities]] (Port Coquitlam, Coquitlam, Port Moody) has three MACC equipped schools, namely Citadel Middle School, Hillcrest Middle School, and Kwayhquitlum Middle School.<ref name=\"Coquitlam\" /> In 2014, two MACC sites were added in Burnaby (School District 41) at [[Capitol Hill Elementary School]] and Suncrest Elementary. Both of these schools have a grade 4/5 and 6/7 class.<ref name=\"Burnaby\" /> There is also a Mini-School program located at [[Alpha Secondary School]].\n\n==The Four Pillars (Curriculum)==\nThe MACC curriculum places emphasis on Four Main Pillars: Autonomous Learning, Numeracy, Literacy, and Project Based Learning. Report cards are often structured around these 4 categories,<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=http://go.vsb.bc.ca/schools/specialneeds/Programs/gifted/Pages/gifted-enrichment.aspx|title=Gifted Enrichment Programs|website=go.vsb.bc.ca|language=en-us|access-date=2017-12-02}}</ref> with subcategories such as Work Habits, Personal Responsibility, Active Learning, and Social Responsibility.\n\n===Autonomous Learning===\nThe word [[autonomous]] means to be independent, self-governing, efficient and to be able to learn by yourself and be a self-motivated learner.  This is a very important life-skill that is heavily emphasized in this program.  The students need to be autonomous, as they are not always reminded of due dates, or to take notes for their projects. This flexible learning style works well for self-motivated, creative, and independent students because it allows them to set their own goals and manage their own time. This benefits students because this teaches students how to become leaders in their own learning. The learning system quite different from the regular system because students run at their own pace, which means that everyone in the class can be in stronger in different areas of learning.\n\n===Numeracy===\nIn the MACC program, students work on self-paced math curriculum work in addition to problem-solving and math contests. This allows for accelerated math learning, and many students are known for going 1, 2 or 3 years beyond their grade level in math. More emphasis is placed on problem-solving to promote critical thinking skills. Some classes have 'individual math work' but in small groups where everyone's skill is more or less the same. Teachers believe that in doing so, this will bring up a lot of interesting math discussion, which they believe is useful in learning math. Also, because of all the work MACC students spend on problem-solving math, MACC students tend to score high in math competitions.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.vsb.bc.ca/district-news/macc-class-students-impress-national-math-tournament-and-local-history-evening|title=MACC Class Students Impress at National Math Tournament and Local History Evening {{!}} Vancouver School Board|website=www.vsb.bc.ca|language=en|access-date=2017-12-02}}</ref> In 2016, 3 Kwayhquitlum students and 1 Tecumseh student 'aced' the Grade 7 Gauss contest by scoring a perfect 150.\n\n===Literacy===\nThe MACC Program offers a variety of different literacy activities, including novel studies, poem analysis, essay writing, persuasive writing, story writing, graphic novel writing, report writing, play writing, and many others. Many of these are for preparation for high school, writing reports for Science Fair,<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.vsb.bc.ca/district-news/annual-science-fair-districts-gifted-learners-program|title=Annual science fair for district's gifted learners program {{!}} Vancouver School Board|website=www.vsb.bc.ca|language=en|access-date=2017-12-02}}</ref> Heritage Fair,<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.vsb.bc.ca/district-news/macc-students-celebrate-heritage-fair-learning-tecumseh|title=MACC Students Celebrate Heritage Fair Learning at Tecumseh {{!}} Vancouver School Board|website=www.vsb.bc.ca|language=en|access-date=2017-12-02}}</ref> and EOE (Evening of Eminence)<ref name=\":4\" /> projects.\n\n===Project-Based Learning===\nIn Project-Based Learning, students explore learning through three main projects each year. These include a Science Fair or Heritage fair project, an EOE, individual or partner research projects, or group drama projects. These projects are usually the biggest thing that students will do while in MACC. However, the Heritage Fair has not always been done in some classes, such as at Hillcrest Middle school. The Science Fair is based on a typical science fair, but students are encouraged to go 'above and beyond',<ref name=\":2\" /> and explore in-depth scientific research questions and experiments. For Heritage Fair, students explore major events in Canadian History and compete in the Canadian Heritage Fair.<ref name=\":3\" /> In 2016, the FI MACC class was honored to created a class Heritage Fair event, about the 100th anniversary of [[Battle of Vimy Ridge|The Battle of Vimy Ridge]], as well as explore the 'birth of Canada'.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.vsb.bc.ca/district-news/kerrisdale%E2%80%99s-macc-program-honours-vimy-ridge-anniversary|title=Kerrisdale\u2019s MACC program honours Vimy Ridge anniversary {{!}} Vancouver School Board|website=www.vsb.bc.ca|language=en|access-date=2017-12-02}}</ref> EOE,<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.vsb.bc.ca/district-news/eminent-historical-characters-pay-visit-museum-vancouver|title=Eminent Historical Characters Pay a Visit to the Museum of Vancouver {{!}} Vancouver School Board|website=www.vsb.bc.ca|language=en|access-date=2017-12-02}}</ref> students decide on an Eminent person to portray, based on the five criteria for an eminent person - Distinct, Distinguished, Determined, Influential and has Integrity - the 3 'D's and 2 'I's. The students end this project with a museum display, usually hosted at the [http://www.museumofvancouver.ca/ MOV] or the [http://www.musqueam.bc.ca/musqueam-cultural-centre-gallery Musqueam Cultural Centre] where they pose as their Eminent person. Many MACC classes also participate in the annual [[Let's Talk Science]] competition at U.B.C., and Surrey teams from Crescent Park and Berkshire Park have won the competition five times since 2010.\n\n==Individualized Education Plan (IEP)==\nIn the MACC program, each student, along with their parents and teachers, personalizes their goals in his/her [[Individualized Education Program|IEP]]. While similar in some aspects to a regular IEP, it is modified to summarize the students' objectives in the four pillars of the MACC program: Literacy, Numeracy, Autonomous Learning and Project-Based Learning. Unlike regular report cards, MACC students' report cards include what the students have done to achieve these goals.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n==See also==\n*[[Vancouver School Board]]\n*[[Surrey School Board]]\n*[[Tecumseh Elementary School]]\n*[[Kerrisdale Elementary School]]\n*[[Sir William Osler Elementary School]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*http://letstalkscience.ca/Programs/Lets-Talk-Science-Challenge\n*https://www.surreyschools.ca/schools/berkshirepark/Pages/default.aspx\n*http://berkshireparkmacc.blogspot.com/\n*https://web.archive.org/web/20111127021702/http://fcweb.sd36.bc.ca/~mcknight_l/?OpenItemURL=S0B2AA234\n*https://web.archive.org/web/20120508054156/http://www.vsb.bc.ca/programs/macc-multi-age-cluster-class\n*https://web.archive.org/web/20111120232104/http://vsb.bc.ca/sites/default/files/school-files/Programs/VSB_Programs_GiftedEducation.pdf\n*http://go.vsb.bc.ca/schools/queenmary/Programs/Pages/MACC-%28Gifted-Education%29.aspx\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:MACC (Multi Age Cluster Class)}}\n[[Category:Gifted education|Multi Age Cluster Class]]\n", "name_user": "G\u00fcnniX", "label": "safe", "comment": "ref name fixed", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MACC_(Multi_Age_Cluster_Class)"}

This complex is then cleaved by [[Factor D]], a serine protease, to form C3b(H2O)Bb, or fluid-phase C3-convertase.

Born in [[Cardiff]], he began his career with his hometown club [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]], joining the side as an apprentice in 1969. He made his professional debut for the club in 1972, winning his first honours the same season by helping the side win the [[Welsh Cup]]. He suffered relegation with Cardiff in 1975 but helped the side win promotion back to the [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]] at the first attempt, scoring 10 goals during the season. \n\nHe made over 500 appearances in all competitions for the club, becoming the club's all-time Football League appearance record holder, during a 13-year spell. He also gained ten caps for Wales.\n\n==Early life==\nDwyer was born on 28 October 1953 in the house where his family resided on Penarth Road in [[Grangetown, Cardiff]]. The area was in the midst of an economic downturn following the end of the Second World War and the demand for coal, one of the main industries of the region, which also affected the local docks.<ref>{{harvnb|Dwyer|Leighton|2011|p=17}}</ref> Dwyer described his family home as having \"tiny living quarters\" and had no bathroom, meaning the family bathed in front of the fire in a metal bath with water boiled on the stove. The house also had no central heating leading to \"very harsh\" nights in winter.<ref name=\"dl1819\">{{harvnb|Dwyer|Leighton|2011|pp=18\u201319}}</ref> His parents had met and married in [[Tonypandy]] where his father had worked as a miner. In the hope of improving their prospects, the pair moved to Cardiff where his father found work at a [[foundry]] in [[Tremorfa]]. His mother, Constance, also took up work in the canteen of an aluminium manufacturing factory.<ref>{{harvnb|Dwyer|Leighton|2011|p=20}}</ref>\n\nDwyer was the fifth child born to his parents. He had three older brothers, Brian, Kenny and Peter, and an older sister, Maureen. His siblings were significantly older than Dwyer and his brothers had already moved out of the family home by the time he was born.<ref name=\"dl1819\"/> Of his three brothers, Kenny died at the age of 36 from diabetes,<ref name=\"dl1819\"/><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.freebmd.org.uk/cgi/information.pl?cite=nLdRsWYvKEND5wzucfk16A&scan=1|title=Index entry|accessdate=29 February 2020|work=FreeBMD|publisher=ONS}}</ref> Peter joined the armed forces. His other, Brian, was a keen sportsman and played football at amateur level for local side St Patrick's. He also represented Wales at boxing at the [[Commonwealth Games|Empire Games]].<ref name=\"dl1819\"/>\n\nAs a child, Dwyer attended St. Patrick's Primary School where he joined the school band as a drummer.<ref>{{harvnb|Dwyer|Leighton|2011|p=21}}</ref> As his family was relatively poor, he and his friends would often steal fruit and vegetables from gardens and, on one occasion, he was caught shoplifting by a policeman.<ref>{{harvnb|Dwyer|Leighton|2011|p=24}}</ref> He took up numerous sporting activities in his youth, including cricket, rugby and baseball, but was most keen on football, idolising [[Billy Bremner]] and [[George Best]]. Dwyer supports [[Cardiff City F.C.]] and began attending matches at the club's home ground, [[Ninian Park]], from a young age. Often unable to afford the entry fee for matches, he and his friends would often sneak into the ground by climbing disused [[Railway tie|railway sleepers]] to scale the fencing around the stands.<ref>{{harvnb|Dwyer|Leighton|2011|pp=26\u201328}}</ref>\n\nDwyer attended Bishop Mostyn High School as a teenager but later admitted to having little interest in pursuing his academic studies, choosing to focus on his sporting activities. He played rugby during midweek and football on Saturdays, sometimes playing two matches in one day, in the morning for his school's team and in the afternoon for North Clive Street Youth Club. In summer months, he also played baseball for Cardiff Catholics.<ref>{{harvnb|Dwyer|Leighton|2011|p=33}}</ref> Dwyer met his future wife Ann in his teens at a local nightclub and the pair began dating soon after.<ref>{{harvnb|Dwyer|Leighton|2011|p=34}}</ref>\n\n==Club career==\n===Youth and first team breakthrough===\nDwyer's childhood dream was to become a professional footballer and his career began to progress at the age of 14 when he was picked to represent the Cardiff Schools side for the first time. He gained international recognition soon after when he was slecetes to represent Wales at under-15 level in the [[Victory Shield]], a youth competition held between the [[Home Nations]].<ref>{{harvnb|Dwyer|Leighton|2011|pp=35\u201337}}</ref> Depsite this, he initially struggled to attract interest from clubs until he was invited to train with the youth team at Cardiff City by Harry Parsons, a long serving employee of the club. Dwyer began training with the side every Tuesday but still held little hope of fulfilling his dream. He was due to start a carpentry apprenticeship with a company at [[Cardiff Docks]] which had been arranged by his brother-in-law who worked at the site. To Dwyer's surprise, he was offered a contract by Cardiff when he turned 16 in 1969, earning around \u00a35 per week.<ref>{{harvnb|Dwyer|Leighton|2011|pp=38\u201339}}</ref>\n\nDwyer became affectionally known as \"Joe\" by Cardiff fans and teammates,<ref name=defenderoao>{{cite web |url=http://icwales.icnetwork.co.uk/footballnation/football-news/2006/12/16/dwyer-the-defender-on-and-off-the-pitch-91466-18274034/ |title=Dwyer the defender on and off the pitch |publisher=South Wales Echo |date=16 December 2006 |accessdate=28 November 2007}}</ref> a nickname that originated during his early years at the club when goalkeeper [[Fred Davies]] commented that Dwyer resembled [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] forward [[Joe Royle]].<ref>{{harvnb|Dwyer|Leighton|2011|p=41}}</ref> As an apprentice, he was also employed as the club's ground staff where youth players were required to fulfill various tasks, such as cleaning kit and clearing rubbish from the stands at the ground after matches.<ref>{{harvnb|Dwyer|Leighton|2011|p=47}}</ref> With no organised age group league to play in, the youth team competed in local amateur divisions against senior teams. During the 1970\u201371 season, Cardiff's youth team entered the [[FA Youth Cup]] and reached the  [[FA Youth Cup Finals of the 1970s|final]] of the competition, the furthest the side has ever advanced. Having won five ties, Cardiff faced [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] in the final.

Cardiff's results gradually stabilised under O'Farrell with Dwyer scoring his first senior goal for the club in a 2\u20130 victory over [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]] on 9 March 1974 after heading in a cross from [[Leighton Phillips]].<ref name=\"s73\"/><ref name=\"dl7072\">{{harvnb|Dwyer|Leighton|2011|pp=70\u201372}}</ref>\n\nO'Farrell resigned suddenly in April 1974 and the side again avoided relegation on the final day of the season, drawing 1\u20131 with [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]] to relegate their opponents in their stead. Dwyer won his second Welsh Cup at the end of the season, as Cardiff defeated [[Stourbridge F.C.|Stourbridge]] under O'Farrell's assistant [[Jimmy Andrews]].<ref name=\"dl7072\"/> In only his second season as a senior professional, Dwyer was ever present in the league for Cardiff, playing in all 42 matches during the campaign, and missed one first team match, the first leg of the Welsh Cup final against Stourbridge, playing 52 times.<ref name=\"s73\"/> Andrews was forced to sell players to balance finances ahead of the 1974\u201376 season and the sales placed further strain on the club's results as the side were placed in the relegation zone midway through the campaign.<ref>{{harvnb|Dwyer|Leighton|2011|pp=77\u201378}}</ref> In January 1975, Cardiff played [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]] at [[The Den]]. With Cardiff trailing 5\u20131, a frustrated Dwyer deliberately collided with Millwall goalkeeper [[Ray Goddard]] causing the opposition player to be stretchered off the field with a concussion. Dwyer's actions had caused fans from both sides to clash and a Millwall supporter ran onto the pitch and aimed a punch at Dwyer. Seeing the punch coming, Dwyer was able to avoid being hit and grabbed the fan in a headlock until he was apprehended by police. Dwyer later refused to press charges against the fan. Cardiff finished the season in 21st position, suffering relegation to the [[Football League Third Division|Third Division]] and went on to lose the Welsh Cup final 5\u20132 to [[Wrexham A.F.C.|Wrexham]] over two legs.<ref>{{harvnb|Dwyer|Leighton|2011|pp=79\u201380}}</ref>\n\n===Promotion and Second Division return===\n\nRelegation prompted Andrews to rebuild his squad, letting several players leave and replacing them with new signings. Dwyer credited one of the new arrivals, Wales international [[Mike England]], as being a positive influence on his game remarking how he \"made me a better player\".<ref>{{harvnb|Dwyer|Leighton|2011|pp=82\u201383}}</ref> Although the team's results were generally positive, Andrews believed his team lacked physical presence in midfield and moved Dwyer into an unfamiliar holding midfield role. As well as his defensive responsibilities, Dwyer also provided an attacking impetus by regularly charging into the penalty area for crosses. This proved fruitful immediately as he scored a brace in his first match in the new role and was denied a first career [[hat-trick]] when he missed a penalty late in the game.<ref>{{harvnb|Dwyer|Leighton|2011|p=84}}</ref> \n\nOn 8 November 1975, while playing in a league match against [[Gillingham F.C.|Gillingham]], Dwyer collided with an opposition player and received a blow from the player's knee to the back of his head and was knocked unconscious. The impact resulted in Dwyer slowing his tongue and he briefly stopped breathing. Cardiff physio Ron Durham managed to clear his airway by using the corner flag pole revive him with [[mouth-to-mouth resuscitation]]. He was taken to hospital by an ambulance that had driven onto the [[Priestfield Stadium|Priestfield]] pitch. Some initial reports even suggested that Dwyer had passed away, however, he was back playing for the Bluebirds just seven days later against [[Colchester United F.C.|Colchester United]].<ref>{{harvnb|Dwyer|Leighton|2011|pp=85\u201386}}</ref> He continued his goalscoring form in his new role, scoring another brace during a 5\u20132 victory over [[Peterborough United F.C.|Peterborough United]] in December and against [[Walsall F.C.|Walsall]] and Colchester in February 1976.<ref name=\"s75\"/> The side went on to secure promotion back to the Second Division at the first attempt, winning six of their last nine matches of the season and conceding a single goal in the process.<ref name=\"s75\"/> Dwyer also won the Welsh Cup for the third time in his career, defeating [[Hereford United F.C.|Hereford United]] over two legs in the final. In the first leg, Dwyer scored twice to finish the campaign with 10 goals in all competitions, a career high tally. He also recorded a career high 58 appearances, missing only one of the club's first team matches in all competitions.<ref name=\"s75\"/><ref>{{harvnb|Dwyer|Leighton|2011|p=90}}</ref>\n\nDwyer missed the start of the [[1976\u20131977 in English football|1976\u201377 season]] after breaking his ankle in a baseball match days before the club's first match of the campaign against Swiss side [[Servette FC|Servette]] in the Cup Winners' Cup. He had continued to play baseball alongside his football career, concealing the fact from the staff at Cardiff, and hid the cause of the injury by claiming he had fallen down the stairs at his home.<ref name=\"dl90\">{{harvnb|Dwyer|Leighton|2011|p=90}}</ref> He returned to the side in late September, in a goalless draw with Millwall.<ref name=\"s76\"/> The team travelled to Georgia ahead for Dwyer's next appearance where they suffered a 3\u20130 defeat to [[FC Dinamo Tbilisi|Dinamo Tbilisi]] in a match that was attended by 100,000 spectators.<ref name=\"s76\"/><ref name=\"dl93\">{{harvnb|Dwyer|Leighton|2011|p=93}}</ref> Upon his return, Dwyer found himself playing in his more usual role in defence rather than in midfield.<ref name=\"dl93\"/> Cardiff again struggled in the Second Division but avoided relegation on the final day of the season, after drawing 1\u20131 with [[Carlisle United F.C.|Carlisle United]].<ref>{{harvnb|Dwyer|Leighton|2011|p=98}}</ref>\n\nAhead of the [[1977\u201378 in English football|1977\u201378 season]], Cardiff was struggling financially and the club was dealt a further blow by the restriction of crowd numbers at Ninian Park due to safety concerns. Dwyer was contacted by a former professional footballer who had recommended him to Greek side [[Panathinaikos F.C.|Panathinaikos]]. Dwyer was offered wages considerably higher than those he received with Cardiff, a villa and places at an English school for his children but the move broke down when Andrews refused to contemplate selling. [[Bristol City F.C.|Bristol City]] and [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]] also made offers for Dwyer, with Bristol's bid totalling around \u00a3150,000, but Andrews again rejected the advances. The club began the season in poor form, winning one of its opening 10 matches.<ref>{{harvnb|Dwyer|Leighton|2011|pp=102\u2013104}}</ref> Dwyer bemoaned that the squad suffered a \"severe lack of confidence\" and the side suffered several heavy defeats, including conceding six goals in consecutive matches against [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]] and [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]] in December 1977.<ref>{{harvnb|Dwyer|Leighton|2011|pp=106\u2013107}}</ref>\n\nIn an attempt to rectify the club's form, Andrews became increasingly desperate and even transfer listed the club's entire playing staff. An injury crisis amongst Cardiff's attacking players also led Andrews to use Dwyer and fellow defender [[Paul Went]] in forward roles in an attempt to utilise the pair's physical presence. Dyer's most notable contribution in the role was a brace during a 2\u20132 draw with [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]] in April 1978.<ref name=\"dl110\">{{harvnb|Dwyer|Leighton|2011|p=110}}</ref><ref name=\"s77\"/> Cardiff ultimately avoided relegation with a game to spare after beating [[Notts County F.C.|Notts County]].<ref>{{harvnb|Dwyer|Leighton|2011|p=111}}</ref>\n\n===Departure of Andrews and new managers===\nDwyer began the following season by scoring in the opening game of the campaign, a 2\u20132 draw with [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]].<ref>{{harvnb|Dwyer|Leighton|2011|p=122}}</ref> However, the club's form remained indifferent and Andrews was sacked from his role as manager in November 1978. He was replaced by [[Richie Morgan]] in an appointment described by Dwyer as a move that shocked every Cardiff City fan, and player\".<ref>{{harvnb|Dwyer|Leighton|2011|p=124}}</ref> Despite his inexperience, Morgan led the club to its highest finish in nearly a decade, with Dwyer remaining a lynch pin of the side making 45 appearances in all competitions.<ref name=\"s78\"/>\n \nHis final appearance for the club came on 17 March 1985 in a 4\u20131 defeat against [[Notts County F.C.|Notts County]]. Following the match, Dwyer lambasted several of his teammates after believing that they had given up during the game. His outburst led manager [[Alan Durban]] to drop Dwyer from the side and inform him that he was no longer needed at the club.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-272511903.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180107061300/https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-272511903.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=7 January 2018 |url-access=subscription |title=Durban Packed Me off to Rochdale after My City Rant - Dwyer |newspaper=South Wales Echo |author=Terry Phillips |date=15 November 2011 |accessdate=6 January 2018 |via=[[HighBeam Research]]}}</ref> Rival South Wales clubs [[Swansea City A.F.C.|Swansea City]] and [[Newport County A.F.C.|Newport County]] showed interest in signing him, although Durban did not inform Dwyer of their interest.

[[Association football|footballer]]. Born in [[Cardiff]], he began his career with his hometown club [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]], joining the side as an apprentice in 1969. He made his professional debut for the club in 1972, winning his first honours the same season by helping the side win the [[Welsh Cup]]. He suffered relegation with Cardiff in 1975 but helped the side win promotion back to the [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]] at the first attempt, scoring 10 goals during the season. \n\nHe made over 500 appearances in all competitions for the club, becoming the club's all-time Football League appearance record holder, during a 13-year spell. He also gained ten caps for Wales.\n\n==Early life==\nDwyer was born on 28 October 1953 in the house where his family resided on Penarth Road in [[Grangetown, Cardiff]]. The area was in the midst of an economic downturn following the end of the Second World War and the demand for coal, one of the main industries of the region, which also affected the local docks.<ref>{{harvnb|Dwyer|Leighton|2011|p=17}}</ref> Dwyer described his family home as having \"tiny living quarters\" and had no bathroom, meaning the family bathed in front of the fire in a metal bath with water boiled on the stove.

Dwyer supports [[Cardiff City F.C.]] and began attending matches at the club's home ground, [[Ninian Park]], from a young age. Often unable to afford the entry fee for matches, he and his friends would often sneak into the ground by climbing disused [[Railway tie|railway sleepers]] to scale the fencing around the stands.<ref>{{harvnb|Dwyer|Leighton|2011|pp=26\u201328}}</ref>\n\nDwyer attended Bishop Mostyn High School as a teenager but later admitted to having little interest in pursuing his academic studies, choosing to focus on his sporting activities. He played rugby during midweek and football on Saturdays, sometimes playing two matches in one day, in the morning for his school's team and in the afternoon for North Clive Street Youth Club. In summer months, he also played baseball for Cardiff Catholics.<ref>{{harvnb|Dwyer|Leighton|2011|p=33}}</ref> Dwyer met his future wife Ann in his teens at a local nightclub and the pair began dating soon after.<ref>{{harvnb|Dwyer|Leighton|2011|p=34}}</ref>\n\n==Club career==\n===Youth and first team breakthrough===\nDwyer's childhood dream was to become a professional footballer and his career began to progress at the age of 14 when he was picked to represent the Cardiff Schools side for the first time.

Dwyer began training with the side every Tuesday but still held little hope of fulfilling his dream. He was due to start a carpentry apprenticeship with a company at [[Cardiff Docks]] which had been arranged by his brother-in-law who worked at the site. To Dwyer's surprise, he was offered a contract by Cardiff when he turned 16 in 1969, earning around \u00a35 per week.<ref>{{harvnb|Dwyer|Leighton|2011|pp=38\u201339}}</ref>\n\nDwyer became affectionally known as \"Joe\" by Cardiff fans and teammates,<ref name=defenderoao>{{cite web |url=http://icwales.icnetwork.co.uk/footballnation/football-news/2006/12/16/dwyer-the-defender-on-and-off-the-pitch-91466-18274034/ |title=Dwyer the defender on and off the pitch |publisher=South Wales Echo |date=16 December 2006 |accessdate=28 November 2007}}</ref> a nickname that originated during his early years at the club when goalkeeper [[Fred Davies]] commented that Dwyer resembled [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] forward [[Joe Royle]].<ref>{{harvnb|Dwyer|Leighton|2011|p=41}}</ref> As an apprentice, he was also employed as the club's ground staff where youth players were required to fulfill various tasks, such as cleaning kit and clearing rubbish from the stands at the ground after matches.<ref>{{harvnb|Dwyer|Leighton|2011|p=47}}</ref> With no organised age group league to play in, the youth team competed in local amateur divisions against senior teams. During the 1970\u201371 season, Cardiff's youth team entered the [[FA Youth Cup]] and reached the  [[FA Youth Cup Finals of the 1970s|final]] of the competition, the furthest the side has ever advanced. Having won five ties, Cardiff faced [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] in the final.

Cardiff were elimined after losing the return leg 2\u20131.<ref name=\"s73\"/> Scoular was sacked in November as the club struggled in the Second Division and was eventually replaced by [[Frank O'Farrell]].<ref>{{harvnb|Dwyer|Leighton|2011|pp=67\u201368}}</ref> Dwyer's performances resulted in his selection for the Wales under-23 side ahead of a match against [[England national under-21 football team|England]] at [[Ashton Gate Stadium]] in January 1974, helping his side to a 0\u20130 draw. Cardiff's results gradually stabilised under O'Farrell with Dwyer scoring his first senior goal for the club in a 2\u20130 victory over [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]] on 9 March 1974 after heading in a cross from [[Leighton Phillips]].<ref name=\"s73\"/><ref name=\"dl7072\">{{harvnb|Dwyer|Leighton|2011|pp=70\u201372}}</ref>\n\nO'Farrell resigned suddenly in April 1974 and the side again avoided relegation on the final day of the season, drawing 1\u20131 with [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]] to relegate their opponents in their stead. Dwyer won his second Welsh Cup at the end of the season, as Cardiff defeated [[Stourbridge F.C.|Stourbridge]] under O'Farrell's assistant [[Jimmy Andrews]].<ref name=\"dl7072\"/> In only his second season as a senior professional, Dwyer was ever present in the league for Cardiff, playing in all 42 matches during the campaign, and missed one first team match, the first leg of the Welsh Cup final against Stourbridge, playing 52 times.<ref name=\"s73\"/> Andrews was forced to sell players to balance finances ahead of the 1974\u201376 season and the sales placed further strain on the club's results as the side were placed in the relegation zone midway through the campaign.<ref>{{harvnb|Dwyer|Leighton|2011|pp=77\u201378}}</ref> In January 1975, Cardiff played [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]] at [[The Den]]. With Cardiff trailing 5\u20131, a frustrated Dwyer deliberately collided with Millwall goalkeeper [[Ray Goddard]] causing the opposition player to be stretchered off the field with a concussion. Dwyer's actions had caused fans from both sides to clash and a Millwall supporter ran onto the pitch and aimed a punch at Dwyer. Seeing the punch coming, Dwyer was able to avoid being hit and grabbed the fan in a headlock until he was apprehended by police. Dwyer later refused to press charges against the fan. Cardiff finished the season in 21st position, suffering relegation to the [[Football League Third Division|Third Division]] and went on to lose the Welsh Cup final 5\u20132 to [[Wrexham A.F.C.|Wrexham]] over two legs.<ref>{{harvnb|Dwyer|Leighton|2011|pp=79\u201380}}</ref>\n\n===Promotion and Second Division return===\n\nRelegation prompted Andrews to rebuild his squad, letting several players leave and replacing them with new signings. Dwyer credited one of the new arrivals, Wales international [[Mike England]], as being a positive influence on his game remarking how he \"made me a better player\".<ref>{{harvnb|Dwyer|Leighton|2011|pp=82\u201383}}</ref> Although the team's results were generally positive, Andrews believed his team lacked physical presence in midfield and moved Dwyer into an unfamiliar holding midfield role. As well as his defensive responsibilities, Dwyer also provided an attacking impetus by regularly charging into the penalty area for crosses. This proved fruitful immediately as he scored a brace in his first match in the new role and was denied a first career [[hat-trick]] when he missed a penalty late in the game.<ref>{{harvnb|Dwyer|Leighton|2011|p=84}}</ref> \n\nOn 8 November 1975, while playing in a league match against [[Gillingham F.C.|Gillingham]], Dwyer collided with an opposition player and received a blow from the player's knee to the back of his head and was knocked unconscious. The impact resulted in Dwyer slowing his tongue and he briefly stopped breathing. Cardiff physio Ron Durham managed to clear his airway by using the corner flag pole revive him with [[mouth-to-mouth resuscitation]]. He was taken to hospital by an ambulance that had driven onto the [[Priestfield Stadium|Priestfield]] pitch. Some initial reports even suggested that Dwyer had passed away, however, he was back playing for the Bluebirds just seven days later against [[Colchester United F.C.|Colchester United]].<ref>{{harvnb|Dwyer|Leighton|2011|pp=85\u201386}}</ref> He continued his goalscoring form in his new role, scoring another brace during a 5\u20132 victory over [[Peterborough United F.C.|Peterborough United]] in December and against [[Walsall F.C.|Walsall]] and Colchester in February 1976.<ref name=\"s75\"/> The side went on to secure promotion back to the Second Division at the first attempt, winning six of their last nine matches of the season and conceding a single goal in the process.<ref name=\"s75\"/> Dwyer also won the Welsh Cup for the third time in his career, defeating [[Hereford United F.C.|Hereford United]] over two legs in the final. In the first leg, Dwyer scored twice to finish the campaign with 10 goals in all competitions, a career high tally. He also recorded a career high 58 appearances, missing only one of the club's first team matches in all competitions.<ref name=\"s75\"/><ref>{{harvnb|Dwyer|Leighton|2011|p=90}}</ref>\n\nDwyer missed the start of the [[1976\u20131977 in English football|1976\u201377 season]] after breaking his ankle in a baseball match days before the club's first match of the campaign against Swiss side [[Servette FC|Servette]] in the Cup Winners' Cup. He had continued to play baseball alongside his football career, concealing the fact from the staff at Cardiff, and hid the cause of the injury by claiming he had fallen down the stairs at his home.<ref name=\"dl90\">{{harvnb|Dwyer|Leighton|2011|p=90}}</ref> He returned to the side in late September, in a goalless draw with Millwall.<ref name=\"s76\"/> The team travelled to Georgia ahead for Dwyer's next appearance where they suffered a 3\u20130 defeat to [[FC Dinamo Tbilisi|Dinamo Tbilisi]] in a match that was attended by 100,000 spectators.<ref name=\"s76\"/><ref name=\"dl93\">{{harvnb|Dwyer|Leighton|2011|p=93}}</ref> Upon his return, Dwyer found himself playing in his more usual role in defence rather than in midfield.<ref name=\"dl93\"/> Cardiff again struggled in the Second Division but avoided relegation on the final day of the season, after drawing 1\u20131 with [[Carlisle United F.C.|Carlisle United]].<ref>{{harvnb|Dwyer|Leighton|2011|p=98}}</ref>\n\nAhead of the [[1977\u201378 in English football|1977\u201378 season]], Cardiff was struggling financially and the club was dealt a further blow by the restriction of crowd numbers at Ninian Park due to safety concerns. Dwyer was contacted by a former professional footballer who had recommended him to Greek side [[Panathinaikos F.C.|Panathinaikos]]. Dwyer was offered wages considerably higher than those he received with Cardiff, a villa and places at an English school for his children but the move broke down when Andrews refused to contemplate selling. [[Bristol City F.C.|Bristol City]] and [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]] also made offers for Dwyer, with Bristol's bid totalling around \u00a3150,000, but Andrews again rejected the advances. The club began the season in poor form, winning one of its opening 10 matches.<ref>{{harvnb|Dwyer|Leighton|2011|pp=102\u2013104}}</ref> Dwyer bemoaned that the squad suffered a \"severe lack of confidence\" and the side suffered several heavy defeats, including conceding six goals in consecutive matches against [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]] and [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]] in December 1977.<ref>{{harvnb|Dwyer|Leighton|2011|pp=106\u2013107}}</ref>\n\nIn an attempt to rectify the club's form, Andrews became increasingly desperate and even transfer listed the club's entire playing staff. An injury crisis amongst Cardiff's attacking players also led Andrews to use Dwyer and fellow defender [[Paul Went]] in forward roles in an attempt to utilise the pair's physical presence. Dyer's most notable contribution in the role was a brace during a 2\u20132 draw with [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]] in April 1978.<ref name=\"dl110\">{{harvnb|Dwyer|Leighton|2011|p=110}}</ref><ref name=\"s77\"/> Cardiff ultimately avoided relegation with a game to spare after beating [[Notts County F.C.|Notts County]].<ref>{{harvnb|Dwyer|Leighton|2011|p=111}}</ref>\n\n===Departure of Andrews and new managers===\nDwyer began the following season by scoring in the opening game of the campaign, a 2\u20132 draw with [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]].<ref>{{harvnb|Dwyer|Leighton|2011|p=122}}</ref> However, the club's form remained indifferent and Andrews was sacked from his role as manager in November 1978.

Following the match, Dwyer lambasted several of his teammates after believing that they had given up during the game.

It generally consists of at least one [[rail track|track]]-side [[railway platform|platform]] and a [[station building]] (depot) providing such ancillary services as [[train ticket|ticket]] sales, [[waiting room]]s and baggage/freight service. If a station is on a [[single track (rail)|single-track]] line, it often has a [[passing loop]] to facilitate traffic movements. The smallest stations are most often referred to as \"stops\" or, in some parts of the world, as \"halts\" ([[flag stop]]s).\n\nStations may be at ground level, underground or elevated. Connections may be available to intersecting [[railway line|rail lines]] or other transport modes such as [[bus]]es, [[tram]]s or other [[rapid transit]] systems.\n\n== Terminology ==\nIn [[British English]], traditional usage favours ''railway station'' or simply ''station'', even though ''train station'', which is often perceived as an Americanism, is now about as common as ''railway station'' in writing; ''railroad station'' is not used, ''railroad'' being obsolete there.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/collegeofjournalism/entries/1cbca265-2424-320c-b032-6e6f7974e221 |title=Steamed up about train stations |publisher=BBC |location=London |website=Academy |author=Ian Jolly |date=1 August 2014 |type=blog |accessdate=28 August 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://bridgingtheunbridgeable.com/2014/11/12/railway-station-or-train-station/ |title=Railway station or train station? |author=Morana Luka\u010d |date=12 November 2014 |website=Bridging the Unbridgeable.

Various forms of architecture have been used in the construction of stations, from those boasting grand, intricate, [[Baroque Revival architecture|Baroque]]- or [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic]]-style edifices, to plainer [[utilitarian]] or [[Modern architecture|modernist]] styles. Stations in Europe tended to follow British designs and were in some countries, like Italy, financed by British railway companies.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://members.aol.com/Zacarious1/his.italy.html| title=Italian Railroad Stations| work=History of Railroad Stations| accessdate=13 March 2008}}</ref>\n\nStations built more recently often have a similar feel to airports, with a simple, abstract style. Examples of modern stations include those on newer [[high-speed rail]] networks, such as the [[Shinkansen]] in Japan, [[THSR]] in the Republic of China, [[TGV]] lines in France and [[InterCityExpress|ICE]] lines in Germany.\n\n== Station facilities ==\n[[File:Presto card at Oriole Station (20181011172332).jpg|thumb|right|A [[Presto card]] and single ticket machine at a suburban train station in Toronto]]\n\nStations usually have staffed ticket sales offices, automated [[ticket machine]]s, or both, although on some lines tickets are sold on board the trains. Many stations include a shop or convenience store. Larger stations usually have [[fast-food]] or [[restaurant]] facilities. In some countries, stations may also have a [[bar (establishment)|bar]] or [[pub]]. Other station facilities may include: [[toilet]]s, [[left-luggage]], [[Lost and found|lost-and-found]], [[public transport timetables|departures and arrivals boards]], luggage carts, [[waiting room]]s, [[taxi rank]]s, [[bus]] bays and even [[car park]]s. Larger or manned stations tend to have a greater range of facilities including also a station security office. These are usually open for travellers when there is sufficient traffic over a long enough period of time to warrant the cost. In large cities this may mean facilities available around the clock. A basic station might only have platforms, though it may still be distinguished from a '''halt''', a stopping or halting place that may not even have platforms.\n\nMany stations, either larger or smaller, offer interchange with local transportation; this can vary from a simple bus stop across the street to underground rapid-transit urban rail stations.\n\nIn many African, South American, and Asian countries, stations are also used as a place for public markets and other informal businesses. This is especially true on [[tourist]] routes or stations near [[tourist destination]]s.\n\nAs well as providing services for passengers and loading facilities for goods, stations can sometimes have locomotive and rolling stock depots (usually with facilities for storing and refuelling rolling stock and carrying out minor repair jobs).\n\n== Station configurations ==\nIn addition to the basic configuration of a station, various features set certain types of station apart. The first is the [[Rail transport#Level|level of the tracks]]. Stations are often sited where a road crosses the railway: unless the crossing is a [[level crossing]], the road and railway will be at different levels. The platforms will often be raised or lowered relative to the station entrance: the station buildings may be on either level, or both. The other arrangement, where the station entrance and platforms are on the same level, is also common, but is perhaps rarer in [[urban area]]s, except when the station is a terminus. Elevated stations are more common, not including metro stations. Stations located at level crossings can be problematic if the train blocks the roadway while it stops, causing road traffic to wait for an extended period of time.\n\nOccasionally, a station serves two or more railway lines at differing levels. This may be due to the station's position at a point where two lines cross (example: [[Berlin Hauptbahnhof]]), or may be to provide separate station capacity for two types of service, such as intercity and suburban (examples: [[Paris-Gare de Lyon]] and [[30th Street Station|Philadelphia's 30th Street Station]]), or for two different destinations.\n\nStations may also be classified according to the layout of the platforms. Apart from single-track lines, the most basic arrangement is a pair of tracks for the two directions; there is then a basic choice of an [[island platform]] between, two separate platforms outside the tracks ([[Side Platform|side platforms]]), or a combination of the two. With more tracks, the possibilities expand.\n\nSome stations have unusual platform layouts due to space constraints of the station location, or the alignment of the tracks. Examples include staggered platforms, such as at [[Tutbury and Hatton railway station]] on the [[Crewe\u2013Derby line]], and curved platforms, such as [[Cheadle Hulme railway station]] on the Macclesfield to Manchester Line. [[Triangle (railway)|Triangular stations]] also exist where two lines form a three-way junction and platforms are built on all three sides, for example {{rws|Shipley}} and {{rws|Earlestown}} stations.\n\n=== Tracks ===\nIn a station, there are different types of tracks to serve different purposes. A station may also have a [[passing loop]] with a loop line that comes off the straight [[Main line (railway)|main line]] and merge back to the main line on the other end by [[railroad switch]]es to allow trains to pass.<ref name=cahsr>{{cite web|title=Technical Memorandum: Typical Cross Section for 15% Design (TM 1.1.21)|url=http://www.hsr.ca.gov/docs/programs/eir_memos/Proj_Guidelines_TM1_1_21R00.pdf|publisher=California High-Speed Rail Program|accessdate=18 March 2014}}</ref>\n\nA track with a spot at the station to board and disembark trains is called '''station track''' or '''house track'''<ref name=mw>{{cite web|title=Station Track|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/station%20track|publisher=Merriam-Webster Dictionary|accessdate=18 March 2014}}</ref> regardless of whether it is a main line or loop line. If such track is served by a [[Railway platform|platform]], the track may be called '''platform track'''. A loop line without a platform which is used to allow a train to clear the main line at the station only, it is called '''passing track'''.<ref name=cahsr/> A track at the station without a platform which is used for trains to pass the station without stopping is called '''through track'''.<ref name=mw/>\n\nThere may be other [[Siding (rail)|sidings]] at the station which are lower speed tracks for other purposes. A '''maintenance track''' or a maintenance siding, usually connected to a passing track, is used for parking maintenance equipment, trains not in service, [[autorack]]s or [[Sleeping car|sleepers]]. A '''[[refuge track]]''' is a dead-end siding that is connected to a station track as a temporary storage of a disabled train.<ref name=cahsr/>\n\n== Terminus ==\n<!-- some articles link here please leave an {{anchor|Terminus}} if changed. Redirect [[Rail terminus]] links here as {{R to section}}. Courtesy note per [[MOS:LINK2SECT]]. -->\n{{multiple image\n|align=right\n|direction=vertical\n|width=250\n|image1=Railway Office, Liverpool, from Bury's Liverpool and Manchester Railway, 1831 - artfinder 267569.jpg\n|caption1=Opened in 1830 and reached through a tunnel, Liverpool's [[Crown Street railway station]] was the first ever railway terminus. The station was demolished after only six years, being replaced by [[Liverpool Lime Street railway station|Lime Street station]] in the city centre. The tunnel still exists.\n|image2=Liverpool Road railway station, Manchester.jpg\n|caption2=Opened in 1830, [[Liverpool Road railway station (Manchester)|Liverpool Road station]] in [[Manchester]] is the oldest surviving railway terminus building in the world.\n|image3=Spa Road railway station 1836.jpg\n|caption3=Opened in 1836, [[Spa Road railway station]] in London was the city's first terminus and also the world's first elevated station and terminus.\n}}\n\nA \"terminus\" or \"terminal\" is a station at the end of a railway line. Trains arriving there have to end their journeys (terminate) or reverse out of the station. Depending on the layout of the station, this usually permits travellers to reach all the [[railway platform|platforms]] without the need to cross any [[rail tracks|tracks]] \u2013 the public entrance to the station and the main reception facilities being at the far end of the platforms.\n\nSometimes, however, the track continues for a short distance beyond the station, and terminating trains continue forwards after depositing their passengers, before either proceeding to sidings or reversing to the station to pick up departing passengers. [[Bondi Junction railway station|Bondi Junction]] and [[Kristiansand Station|Kristiansand Station, Norway]], are like this.\n\nA terminus is frequently, but not always, the final destination of trains arriving at the station. Especially in continental Europe, a city may have a terminus as its main railway station, and all main lines converge on it. In such cases all trains arriving at the terminus must leave in the reverse direction from that of their arrival. There are several ways in which this can be accomplished:\n* arranging for the service to be provided by a [[multiple-unit]] or [[push-pull train]], both of which are capable of operating in either direction; the driver simply walks to the other end of the train and takes control from the other cab; this is increasingly the normal method in Europe; and is very common in North America;\n* by detaching the locomotive which brought the train into the station and then either\n** using another track to \"run it around\" to the other end of the train, to which it then re-attaches;\n** attaching a second locomotive to the outbound end of the train; or\n* by the use of a \"[[Wye (railroad)|wye]]\", a roughly triangular arrangement of track and [[Railroad switch|switches]] (points) where a train can reverse direction and back into the terminal;\n* historically, [[Railway turntable|turntables]] were used to reverse steam engines.\nThere may also be a bypass line, used by freight trains that do not need to stop at the terminus.\n\nSome termini have a newer set of through platforms underneath (or above, or alongside) the terminal platforms on the main level. They are used by a cross-city extension of the main line, often for [[Commuter rail|commuter trains]], while the terminal platforms may serve long-distance services. Examples of underground through lines include the [[Thameslink (route)|Thameslink]] platforms at {{stnlnk|Blackfriars}} in London, the [[Argyle Line|Argyle]] and [[North Clyde Line|North Clyde]] lines of [[Strathclyde Partnership for Transport|Glasgow's suburban rail network]], in [[Antwerp]] in Belgium, the [[R\u00e9seau Express R\u00e9gional|RER]] at the [[Gare du Nord]] in Paris, the [[Milan]] [[Milan suburban railway service|suburban railway service]]'s [[Milan Passante railway|Passante railway]], and many of the numerous [[S-Bahn]] lines at terminal stations in Germany, Austria and Switzerland, such as at [[Z\u00fcrich Hauptbahnhof]].\n\nAn American example of a terminal with this feature is [[Union Station (Washington, D.C.)|Union Station in Washington, DC]], where there are bay platforms on the main concourse level to serve terminating trains and standard island platforms one level below to serve trains continuing southwards. The lower tracks run in a tunnel beneath the concourse and emerge a few blocks away to cross the Potomac River into Virginia.\n\nTerminus stations in large cities are by far the biggest stations, with the largest being the [[Grand Central Terminal]] in New York City.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fodors.com/world/north-america/usa/new-york/new-york-city/review-56720.html|title=Grand Central Terminal|work=Fodor's: New York City }}</ref> \"[[Roma Termini railway station|Termini]]\" is the name of Rome's central train ststion. Other major cities, such as London, [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]], Paris, [[Istanbul]], Tokyo, and [[Milan]]  have more than one terminus, rather than routes straight through the city. Train journeys through such cities often require alternative transport ([[rapid transit|metro]], [[bus]], [[taxicab|taxi]] or [[ferry]]) from one terminus to the other. For instance, in Istanbul transfers from the [[\u0130stanbul Sirkeci Terminal|Sirkeci Terminal]] (the European terminus) and the [[Haydarpa\u015fa Terminal]] (the Asian terminus) traditionally required crossing the [[Bosphorus]] via alternative means, before the [[Marmaray]] railway tunnel linking Europe and Asia was completed. Some cities, including New York, have both termini and through lines.\n\nTerminals that have competing rail lines using the station frequently set up a jointly owned [[terminal railroad]] to own and operate the station and its associated tracks and switching operations.\n\n== Stop ==\nDuring a journey, the term '''station stop''' may be used in announcements, to differentiate a halt during which passengers may alight for another reason, such as a [[locomotive change]].\n\nA '''railway stop''' is a spot along a [[railway line]], usually between stations or at a seldom-used station, where [[passenger]]s can board and exit the [[train]].\n\nWhile a junction or [[interlocking]] usually divides two or more lines or routes, and thus has remotely or locally operated [[railway signal|signals]], a station stop does not. A station stop usually does not have any tracks other than the main tracks, and may or may not have [[railroad switch|switches]] (points, crossovers).\n\n=== Halt ===\n<!-- This section is linked from [[Halt]] -->\n{{see also|Request stop}}\nA '''halt''', in railway parlance in the [[Commonwealth of Nations]] and [[Republic of Ireland]], is a small station, usually unstaffed or with very few staff, and with few or no facilities. In some cases, trains stop only on [[Request stop|request]], when passengers on the platform indicate that they wish to board, or passengers on the train inform the crew that they wish to alight.\n[[File:St Keyne 1533361.jpg|thumb|right|[[St Keyne Wishing Well Halt railway station|St Keyne Wishing Well Halt]]]]\n\nIn the United Kingdom, most former halts on the national railway networks have had the word ''halt'' removed from their names. Historically, in many instances the spelling \"halte\" was used, before the spelling \"halt\" became commonplace. There are only two publicly advertised and publicly accessible National Rail stations with the word \"halt\" remaining: {{stnlnk|Coombe Junction Halt}} and {{stnlnk|St Keyne Wishing Well Halt}}.<ref>GB Rail Timetable Winter Edition 8 December 2013</ref><ref name=\"railchronology.free-online.co.uk\">{{cite web|url=http://www.railchronology.free-online.co.uk/Halts%20and%20Platforms.htm|title=Rail Chronology: Halts and Platforms|publisher=}}</ref> In addition there are many other such stops in the UK rail network such as {{stnlnk|Penmaenmawr}} in [[North Wales]], {{stnlnk|Yorton}} in [[Shropshire]], and {{stnlnk|The Lakes}} in [[Warwickshire]], where passengers are requested to inform a member of on-board train staff if they wish to alight, or, if catching a train from the station, to make themselves clearly visible to the driver and use a hand signal as the train approaches.<ref>{{cite web |title=National Rail Enquiries |url=http://www.nationalrail.co.uk/stations_destinations/pmw.aspx |accessdate=30 July 2018}}</ref>\n\nA number of other halts are still open and operational on privately owned, heritage, and preserved railways throughout the British Isles. The word is often used informally to describe national rail network stations with limited service and low usage, such as the ''Oxfordshire Halts'' on the [[Cotswold Line]]. The title halt had also sometimes been applied colloquially to stations served by public services but not available for use by the general public, being accessible only by persons travelling to/from an associated factory (for example IBM near Greenock  and [[British Steel Redcar railway station|British Steel Redcar]]\u2013 although neither of these is any longer served by trains), or military base (such as [[Lympstone Commando railway station|Lympstone Commando]]) or railway yard.  The only two such remaining \"private\" stopping places on the national system where the \"halt\" designation is still officially used seem to be Staff Halt (at Durnsford Road, Wimbledon) and Battersea Pier Sidings Staff Halt \u2013 both are solely for railway staff and are '''not''' open to passengers.<ref name=\"railchronology.free-online.co.uk\"/>\n\nThe [[Great Western Railway]] in Great Britain began opening ''haltes'' on 12 October 1903; from 1905, the French spelling was Anglicised to \"halt\". These GWR halts had the most basic facilities, with platforms long enough for just one or two carriages; some had no raised platform at all, necessitating the provision of steps on the carriages. Halts were normally unstaffed, tickets being sold on the train. On 1 September 1904, a larger version, known on the GWR as a \"platform\" instead of a \"halt\", was introduced; these had longer platforms, and were usually staffed by a senior grade porter, who sold tickets, and sometimes booked parcels or milk consignments.<ref>{{cite book |last=MacDermot |first=E.T. |title=History of the Great Western Railway |volume=Vol. II |publisher=[[Great Western Railway]] |location=Paddington |edition=1st |year=1931 |page=428 |chapter=Chapter XI: The Great Awakening |isbn=978-0-7110-0411-5 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Booker |first=Frank |title=The Great Western Railway: A New History |edition=2nd |origyear=1977 |year=1985 |publisher=[[David & Charles]] |location=Newton Abbot |isbn=978-0-946537-16-7 |pages=112\u2013113 }}</ref>\n\nFrom 1903 to 1947 the GWR built 379 halts and inherited a further 40 from other companies at the [[Railways Act 1921|Grouping]] of 1923. Peak building periods were before the [[First World War]] (145 built) and 1928\u201339 (198 built){{sfn|Coleford|2010|p=509}}). Ten more were opened by [[British Rail|BR]] on ex-GWR lines. The GWR also built 34 \"platforms\".{{sfn|Reade|1983|loc=Section: In praise of halts}}\n\nIn many [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries the term \"halt\" is still used. In the United States such stations are traditionally referred to as [[flag stop#United States|flag stops]]. In Germany, the term is ''[[Haltepunkt]]'' (''Hp'').\n\nIn the [[Republic of Ireland]], a few small railway stations are designated as \"halts\" ({{Lang-ga|stadanna}}, sing. ''stad'').<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.teanglann.ie/ga/eid/halt|title=English\u2013Irish Dictionary (de Bhaldraithe): halt|website=www.teanglann.ie}}</ref>\n\nIn [[Victoria, Australia]], a '''rail motor stopping place''' ('''RMSP''') is a location on a railway line where a small passenger vehicle or [[railmotor]] can stop to allow passengers to alight. It is often designated by just a sign beside the railway<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wiki.prov.vic.gov.au/index.php/VPRS_12800_P1_H_4877|title=Public Records Office Victoria}}</ref> at a convenient access point near a road.

Considerations include: elevator or ramp access to all platforms, matching platform height to train floors, making wheelchair lifts available when platforms do not match vehicle floors, accessible toilets and pay phones, audible station announcements, and safety measures such as tactile marking of platform edges.\n\n== Goods stations ==\n[[File:09 Warehouses etc at the end of the Tunnel towards Wapping, from Bury's Liverpool and Manchester Railway, 1831 - artfinder 267568.jpg|thumb|right|Reached by a {{convert|1.24|mi|0|adj=on}} long tunnel, the 1830 [[Park Lane railway goods station|Park Lane Goods Terminus]] at Liverpool's docks was the world's first station built entirely for freight.]]\n{{Main|Goods station}}\n\nGoods or freight stations deal exclusively or predominantly with the loading and unloading of goods and may well have [[marshalling yards]] (classification yards) for the sorting of wagons.

Stations in Europe tended to follow British designs and were in some countries, like Italy, financed by British railway companies.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://members.aol.com/Zacarious1/his.italy.html| title=Italian Railroad Stations| work=History of Railroad Stations| accessdate=13 March 2008}}</ref>\n\nStations built more recently often have a similar feel to airports, with a simple, abstract style. Examples of modern stations include those on newer [[high-speed rail]] networks, such as the [[Shinkansen]] in Japan, [[THSR]] in the Republic of China, [[TGV]] lines in France and [[InterCityExpress|ICE]] lines in Germany.\n\n== Station facilities ==\n[[File:Presto card at Oriole Station (20181011172332).jpg|thumb|right|A [[Presto card]] and single ticket machine at a suburban train station in Toronto]]\n\nStations usually have staffed ticket sales offices, automated [[ticket machine]]s, or both, although on some lines tickets are sold on board the trains. Many stations include a shop or convenience store. Larger stations usually have [[fast-food]] or [[restaurant]] facilities. In some countries, stations may also have a [[bar (establishment)|bar]] or [[pub]]. Other station facilities may include: [[toilet]]s, [[left-luggage]], [[Lost and found|lost-and-found]], [[public transport timetables|departures and arrivals boards]], luggage carts, [[waiting room]]s, [[taxi rank]]s, [[bus]] bays and even [[car park]]s. Larger or manned stations tend to have a greater range of facilities including also a station security office. These are usually open for travellers when there is sufficient traffic over a long enough period of time to warrant the cost. In large cities this may mean facilities available around the clock. A basic station might only have platforms, though it may still be distinguished from a '''halt''', a stopping or halting place that may not even have platforms.\n\nMany stations, either larger or smaller, offer interchange with local transportation; this can vary from a simple bus stop across the street to underground rapid-transit urban rail stations.\n\nIn many African, South American, and Asian countries, stations are also used as a place for public markets and other informal businesses. This is especially true on [[tourist]] routes or stations near [[tourist destination]]s.\n\nAs well as providing services for passengers and loading facilities for goods, stations can sometimes have locomotive and rolling stock depots (usually with facilities for storing and refuelling rolling stock and carrying out minor repair jobs).\n\n== Station configurations ==\nIn addition to the basic configuration of a station, various features set certain types of station apart. The first is the [[Rail transport#Level|level of the tracks]]. Stations are often sited where a road crosses the railway: unless the crossing is a [[level crossing]], the road and railway will be at different levels. The platforms will often be raised or lowered relative to the station entrance: the station buildings may be on either level, or both. The other arrangement, where the station entrance and platforms are on the same level, is also common, but is perhaps rarer in [[urban area]]s, except when the station is a terminus. Elevated stations are more common, not including metro stations. Stations located at level crossings can be problematic if the train blocks the roadway while it stops, causing road traffic to wait for an extended period of time.\n\nOccasionally, a station serves two or more railway lines at differing levels. This may be due to the station's position at a point where two lines cross (example: [[Berlin Hauptbahnhof]]), or may be to provide separate station capacity for two types of service, such as intercity and suburban (examples: [[Paris-Gare de Lyon]] and [[30th Street Station|Philadelphia's 30th Street Station]]), or for two different destinations.\n\nStations may also be classified according to the layout of the platforms. Apart from single-track lines, the most basic arrangement is a pair of tracks for the two directions; there is then a basic choice of an [[island platform]] between, two separate platforms outside the tracks ([[Side Platform|side platforms]]), or a combination of the two. With more tracks, the possibilities expand.\n\nSome stations have unusual platform layouts due to space constraints of the station location, or the alignment of the tracks. Examples include staggered platforms, such as at [[Tutbury and Hatton railway station]] on the [[Crewe\u2013Derby line]], and curved platforms, such as [[Cheadle Hulme railway station]] on the Macclesfield to Manchester Line. [[Triangle (railway)|Triangular stations]] also exist where two lines form a three-way junction and platforms are built on all three sides, for example {{rws|Shipley}} and {{rws|Earlestown}} stations.\n\n=== Tracks ===\nIn a station, there are different types of tracks to serve different purposes. A station may also have a [[passing loop]] with a loop line that comes off the straight [[Main line (railway)|main line]] and merge back to the main line on the other end by [[railroad switch]]es to allow trains to pass.<ref name=cahsr>{{cite web|title=Technical Memorandum: Typical Cross Section for 15% Design (TM 1.1.21)|url=http://www.hsr.ca.gov/docs/programs/eir_memos/Proj_Guidelines_TM1_1_21R00.pdf|publisher=California High-Speed Rail Program|accessdate=18 March 2014}}</ref>\n\nA track with a spot at the station to board and disembark trains is called '''station track''' or '''house track'''<ref name=mw>{{cite web|title=Station Track|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/station%20track|publisher=Merriam-Webster Dictionary|accessdate=18 March 2014}}</ref> regardless of whether it is a main line or loop line. If such track is served by a [[Railway platform|platform]], the track may be called '''platform track'''. A loop line without a platform which is used to allow a train to clear the main line at the station only, it is called '''passing track'''.<ref name=cahsr/> A track at the station without a platform which is used for trains to pass the station without stopping is called '''through track'''.<ref name=mw/>\n\nThere may be other [[Siding (rail)|sidings]] at the station which are lower speed tracks for other purposes. A '''maintenance track''' or a maintenance siding, usually connected to a passing track, is used for parking maintenance equipment, trains not in service, [[autorack]]s or [[Sleeping car|sleepers]]. A '''[[refuge track]]''' is a dead-end siding that is connected to a station track as a temporary storage of a disabled train.<ref name=cahsr/>\n\n== Terminus ==\n<!-- some articles link here please leave an {{anchor|Terminus}} if changed. Redirect [[Rail terminus]] links here as {{R to section}}. Courtesy note per [[MOS:LINK2SECT]]. -->\n{{multiple image\n|align=right\n|direction=vertical\n|width=250\n|image1=Railway Office, Liverpool, from Bury's Liverpool and Manchester Railway, 1831 - artfinder 267569.jpg\n|caption1=Opened in 1830 and reached through a tunnel, Liverpool's [[Crown Street railway station]] was the first ever railway terminus. The station was demolished after only six years, being replaced by [[Liverpool Lime Street railway station|Lime Street station]] in the city centre. The tunnel still exists.\n|image2=Liverpool Road railway station, Manchester.jpg\n|caption2=Opened in 1830, [[Liverpool Road railway station (Manchester)|Liverpool Road station]] in [[Manchester]] is the oldest surviving railway terminus building in the world.\n|image3=Spa Road railway station 1836.jpg\n|caption3=Opened in 1836, [[Spa Road railway station]] in London was the city's first terminus and also the world's first elevated station and terminus.\n}}\n\nA \"terminus\" or \"terminal\" is a station at the end of a railway line. Trains arriving there have to end their journeys (terminate) or reverse out of the station. Depending on the layout of the station, this usually permits travellers to reach all the [[railway platform|platforms]] without the need to cross any [[rail tracks|tracks]] \u2013 the public entrance to the station and the main reception facilities being at the far end of the platforms.\n\nSometimes, however, the track continues for a short distance beyond the station, and terminating trains continue forwards after depositing their passengers, before either proceeding to sidings or reversing to the station to pick up departing passengers. [[Bondi Junction railway station|Bondi Junction]] and [[Kristiansand Station|Kristiansand Station, Norway]], are like this.\n\nA terminus is frequently, but not always, the final destination of trains arriving at the station. Especially in continental Europe, a city may have a terminus as its main railway station, and all main lines converge on it. In such cases all trains arriving at the terminus must leave in the reverse direction from that of their arrival. There are several ways in which this can be accomplished:\n* arranging for the service to be provided by a [[multiple-unit]] or [[push-pull train]], both of which are capable of operating in either direction; the driver simply walks to the other end of the train and takes control from the other cab; this is increasingly the normal method in Europe; and is very common in North America;\n* by detaching the locomotive which brought the train into the station and then either\n** using another track to \"run it around\" to the other end of the train, to which it then re-attaches;\n** attaching a second locomotive to the outbound end of the train; or\n* by the use of a \"[[Wye (railroad)|wye]]\", a roughly triangular arrangement of track and [[Railroad switch|switches]] (points) where a train can reverse direction and back into the terminal;\n* historically, [[Railway turntable|turntables]] were used to reverse steam engines.\nThere may also be a bypass line, used by freight trains that do not need to stop at the terminus.\n\nSome termini have a newer set of through platforms underneath (or above, or alongside) the terminal platforms on the main level. They are used by a cross-city extension of the main line, often for [[Commuter rail|commuter trains]], while the terminal platforms may serve long-distance services. Examples of underground through lines include the [[Thameslink (route)|Thameslink]] platforms at {{stnlnk|Blackfriars}} in London, the [[Argyle Line|Argyle]] and [[North Clyde Line|North Clyde]] lines of [[Strathclyde Partnership for Transport|Glasgow's suburban rail network]], in [[Antwerp]] in Belgium, the [[R\u00e9seau Express R\u00e9gional|RER]] at the [[Gare du Nord]] in Paris, the [[Milan]] [[Milan suburban railway service|suburban railway service]]'s [[Milan Passante railway|Passante railway]], and many of the numerous [[S-Bahn]] lines at terminal stations in Germany, Austria and Switzerland, such as at [[Z\u00fcrich Hauptbahnhof]].\n\nAn American example of a terminal with this feature is [[Union Station (Washington, D.C.)|Union Station in Washington, DC]], where there are bay platforms on the main concourse level to serve terminating trains and standard island platforms one level below to serve trains continuing southwards. The lower tracks run in a tunnel beneath the concourse and emerge a few blocks away to cross the Potomac River into Virginia.\n\nTerminus stations in large cities are by far the biggest stations, with the largest being the [[Grand Central Terminal]] in New York City.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fodors.com/world/north-america/usa/new-york/new-york-city/review-56720.html|title=Grand Central Terminal|work=Fodor's: New York City }}</ref> \"[[Roma Termini railway station|Termini]]\" is the name of Rome's central train ststion. Other major cities, such as London, [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]], Paris, [[Istanbul]], Tokyo, and [[Milan]]  have more than one terminus, rather than routes straight through the city. Train journeys through such cities often require alternative transport ([[rapid transit|metro]], [[bus]], [[taxicab|taxi]] or [[ferry]]) from one terminus to the other. For instance, in Istanbul transfers from the [[\u0130stanbul Sirkeci Terminal|Sirkeci Terminal]] (the European terminus) and the [[Haydarpa\u015fa Terminal]] (the Asian terminus) traditionally required crossing the [[Bosphorus]] via alternative means, before the [[Marmaray]] railway tunnel linking Europe and Asia was completed. Some cities, including New York, have both termini and through lines.\n\nTerminals that have competing rail lines using the station frequently set up a jointly owned [[terminal railroad]] to own and operate the station and its associated tracks and switching operations.\n\n== Stop ==\nDuring a journey, the term '''station stop''' may be used in announcements, to differentiate a halt during which passengers may alight for another reason, such as a [[locomotive change]].\n\nA '''railway stop''' is a spot along a [[railway line]], usually between stations or at a seldom-used station, where [[passenger]]s can board and exit the [[train]].\n\nWhile a junction or [[interlocking]] usually divides two or more lines or routes, and thus has remotely or locally operated [[railway signal|signals]], a station stop does not. A station stop usually does not have any tracks other than the main tracks, and may or may not have [[railroad switch|switches]] (points, crossovers).\n\n=== Halt ===\n<!-- This section is linked from [[Halt]] -->\n{{see also|Request stop}}\nA '''halt''', in railway parlance in the [[Commonwealth of Nations]] and [[Republic of Ireland]], is a small station, usually unstaffed or with very few staff, and with few or no facilities. In some cases, trains stop only on [[Request stop|request]], when passengers on the platform indicate that they wish to board, or passengers on the train inform the crew that they wish to alight.\n[[File:St Keyne 1533361.jpg|thumb|right|[[St Keyne Wishing Well Halt railway station|St Keyne Wishing Well Halt]]]]\n\nIn the United Kingdom, most former halts on the national railway networks have had the word ''halt'' removed from their names. Historically, in many instances the spelling \"halte\" was used, before the spelling \"halt\" became commonplace. There are only two publicly advertised and publicly accessible National Rail stations with the word \"halt\" remaining: {{stnlnk|Coombe Junction Halt}} and {{stnlnk|St Keyne Wishing Well Halt}}.<ref>GB Rail Timetable Winter Edition 8 December 2013</ref><ref name=\"railchronology.free-online.co.uk\">{{cite web|url=http://www.railchronology.free-online.co.uk/Halts%20and%20Platforms.htm|title=Rail Chronology: Halts and Platforms|publisher=}}</ref> In addition there are many other such stops in the UK rail network such as {{stnlnk|Penmaenmawr}} in [[North Wales]], {{stnlnk|Yorton}} in [[Shropshire]], and {{stnlnk|The Lakes}} in [[Warwickshire]], where passengers are requested to inform a member of on-board train staff if they wish to alight, or, if catching a train from the station, to make themselves clearly visible to the driver and use a hand signal as the train approaches.<ref>{{cite web |title=National Rail Enquiries |url=http://www.nationalrail.co.uk/stations_destinations/pmw.aspx |accessdate=30 July 2018}}</ref>\n\nA number of other halts are still open and operational on privately owned, heritage, and preserved railways throughout the British Isles. The word is often used informally to describe national rail network stations with limited service and low usage, such as the ''Oxfordshire Halts'' on the [[Cotswold Line]]. The title halt had also sometimes been applied colloquially to stations served by public services but not available for use by the general public, being accessible only by persons travelling to/from an associated factory (for example IBM near Greenock  and [[British Steel Redcar railway station|British Steel Redcar]]\u2013 although neither of these is any longer served by trains), or military base (such as [[Lympstone Commando railway station|Lympstone Commando]]) or railway yard.  The only two such remaining \"private\" stopping places on the national system where the \"halt\" designation is still officially used seem to be Staff Halt (at Durnsford Road, Wimbledon) and Battersea Pier Sidings Staff Halt \u2013 both are solely for railway staff and are '''not''' open to passengers.<ref name=\"railchronology.free-online.co.uk\"/>\n\nThe [[Great Western Railway]] in Great Britain began opening ''haltes'' on 12 October 1903; from 1905, the French spelling was Anglicised to \"halt\". These GWR halts had the most basic facilities, with platforms long enough for just one or two carriages; some had no raised platform at all, necessitating the provision of steps on the carriages. Halts were normally unstaffed, tickets being sold on the train. On 1 September 1904, a larger version, known on the GWR as a \"platform\" instead of a \"halt\", was introduced; these had longer platforms, and were usually staffed by a senior grade porter, who sold tickets, and sometimes booked parcels or milk consignments.<ref>{{cite book |last=MacDermot |first=E.T. |title=History of the Great Western Railway |volume=Vol. II |publisher=[[Great Western Railway]] |location=Paddington |edition=1st |year=1931 |page=428 |chapter=Chapter XI: The Great Awakening |isbn=978-0-7110-0411-5 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Booker |first=Frank |title=The Great Western Railway: A New History |edition=2nd |origyear=1977 |year=1985 |publisher=[[David & Charles]] |location=Newton Abbot |isbn=978-0-946537-16-7 |pages=112\u2013113 }}</ref>\n\nFrom 1903 to 1947 the GWR built 379 halts and inherited a further 40 from other companies at the [[Railways Act 1921|Grouping]] of 1923. Peak building periods were before the [[First World War]] (145 built) and 1928\u201339 (198 built){{sfn|Coleford|2010|p=509}}). Ten more were opened by [[British Rail|BR]] on ex-GWR lines. The GWR also built 34 \"platforms\".{{sfn|Reade|1983|loc=Section: In praise of halts}}\n\nIn many [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries the term \"halt\" is still used. In the United States such stations are traditionally referred to as [[flag stop#United States|flag stops]]. In Germany, the term is ''[[Haltepunkt]]'' (''Hp'').\n\nIn the [[Republic of Ireland]], a few small railway stations are designated as \"halts\" ({{Lang-ga|stadanna}}, sing. ''stad'').<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.teanglann.ie/ga/eid/halt|title=English\u2013Irish Dictionary (de Bhaldraithe): halt|website=www.teanglann.ie}}</ref>\n\nIn [[Victoria, Australia]], a '''rail motor stopping place''' ('''RMSP''') is a location on a railway line where a small passenger vehicle or [[railmotor]] can stop to allow passengers to alight. It is often designated by just a sign beside the railway<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wiki.prov.vic.gov.au/index.php/VPRS_12800_P1_H_4877|title=Public Records Office Victoria}}</ref> at a convenient access point near a road. The passenger can hail the train driver to stop, and buy a ticket from the guard or the conductor on the train.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://museumvictoria.com.au/railways/theme.aspx?lvl=3&IRN=503&gall=680|title=Museum Victoria, Railmotors}}</ref>\n\n== Accessibility ==\nAccessibility for people with disabilities is mandated by law in some countries.  Considerations include: elevator or ramp access to all platforms, matching platform height to train floors, making wheelchair lifts available when platforms do not match vehicle floors, accessible toilets and pay phones, audible station announcements, and safety measures such as tactile marking of platform edges.\n\n== Goods stations ==\n[[File:09 Warehouses etc at the end of the Tunnel towards Wapping, from Bury's Liverpool and Manchester Railway, 1831 - artfinder 267568.jpg|thumb|right|Reached by a {{convert|1.24|mi|0|adj=on}} long tunnel, the 1830 [[Park Lane railway goods station|Park Lane Goods Terminus]] at Liverpool's docks was the world's first station built entirely for freight.]]\n{{Main|Goods station}}\n\nGoods or freight stations deal exclusively or predominantly with the loading and unloading of goods and may well have [[marshalling yards]] (classification yards) for the sorting of wagons.

Built in 1830, the terminal was reached by a {{convert|1.24|mi|0|adj=on}} tunnel.\n\nAs goods are increasingly moved by road, many former goods stations, as well as the goods sheds at passenger stations, have closed.
