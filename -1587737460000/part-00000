However, the group refused to comply with the decision on its dissolution and stated that it was leaving the party, leaving the right to appeal to the nearest party congress, taking the name - the Minority Party of Socialist-Revolutionaries (MPSR). The speeches by the MPSR at the [[All-Russian Congress of Soviets#Seventh Congress|Seventh]] and [[All-Russian Congress of Soviets#Eighth Congress|Eighth]] All-Russian Congresses of Soviets spoke about the need to bring democracy to the Soviet government, review the functions of the [[Cheka]], review the provisions of the Constitution of the [[RSFSR]] (introduce provisions on [[universal suffrage]], the right to [[free speech]] for workers, the right to [[freedom of the press]], [[freedom of assembly]], guarantees against extrajudicial reprisals against workers and the provision of freedom of action to those social movements and political parties that do not fight against the Soviet regime).\n\nDuring the [[Kronstadt rebellion]] in March 1921, the MPSR created the \"Political Center\", allegedly, to serve the function of the future government - this included two members of the MPSR Central Bureau, including Vol'skii. Other members of the Central Bank proposed to expel Vol'skii from the MPSR and conduct a party investigation in the case of the Political Center. In March 1922, the [[State Political Directorate|GPU]] exposed the Political Center and other material from the state's investigation of the party, seized during a year of searches and arrests <ref>{{cite book|first=L.

Vol'skii was arrested by the [[Cheka]], spent three years in the [[Pertominsk]] [[concentration camp]], and was later sent to prison - first to [[Solovki prison camp|Solovki]], then to [[Semey]].\n\nHe was again arrested in February 1937, during the [[Great Purge]]. On September 22, 1937, [[Stalin]], [[Molotov]] and [[Zhdanov]] signed the \u201cList of Persons Subject to the Court of the Military Collegium of the Supreme Court of the USSR\u201d ([[Kazakh SSR]]). Vol'skii was shot for belonging to an \"anti-Soviet terrorist organization.\"<ref name=\"Smele\" /> Volski'i was rehabilitated in 1991.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:1887 births]]\n[[Category:1937 deaths]]\n[[Category:Great Purge victims from Russia]]\n", "name_user": "Grnrchst", "label": "safe", "comment": "DABed links", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Vol%27skii"}

In modern usage, \"Greek letter organization\" is often synonymous with the terms \"fraternity\" and \"sorority\". Two additional types of fraternities, professional fraternities and honor societies, incorporate some limited elements of traditional fraternity organization, but are generally considered a different type of association. Traditional fraternities of the type described in this article are often called \"social fraternities\".\n\nGenerally, membership in a fraternity or sorority is obtained as an [[Undergraduate education|undergraduate]] [[Higher education|student]] but continues, thereafter, for life.

The founding of Phi Beta Kappa followed the earlier establishment of two other secret student societies that had existed at that campus as early as 1750. In 1779 Phi Beta Kappa expanded to include chapters at Harvard and Yale.  By the early 19th century, the organization transformed itself into a scholastic honor society and abandoned secrecy.\n\nIn 1825, [[Kappa Alpha Society]], the oldest extant fraternity to retain its social characteristic, was established at [[Union College]]. In 1827, [[Sigma Phi]] and [[Delta Phi]] were also founded at the same institution,<ref name=handbook>{{cite book|last1=Whalen|first1=Richard|title=Handbook of Secret Organizations|date=1967|publisher=Bruce Publishing Company|location=Milwaukee|pages=43\u201345}}</ref> creating the [[Union Triad]]. The further birthing of [[Psi Upsilon]] (1833), [[Chi Psi]] (1841) and [[Theta Delta Chi]] (1847) collectively established Union College as the [[Mother of Fraternities]].\nThe social fraternity [[Chi Phi]], although officially formed in 1854, traces its roots to 1824,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://chiphi.dynamic.omegafi.com/about-chi-phi/|title=History of Chi Phi|author=|date=|website=www.chiphi.org|accessdate=14 March 2019}}</ref> and oldest.org considers it the oldest social fraternity.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oldest.org/culture/fraternities-north-america/|title=7 Oldest Fraternities in North America|author=|date=|website=www.oldest.org|accessdate=14 March 2019}}</ref>\n\nFraternities represented the intersection between [[dining club]]s, [[College literary societies|literary societies]] and secret initiatory orders such as [[Freemasonry]]. Their early growth was widely opposed by university administrators, though the increasing influence of fraternity alumni, as well as several high-profile court cases, succeeded in largely muting opposition by the 1880s.<ref name=\"handbook\"/> The first fraternity meeting hall, or lodge, seems to have been that of the Alpha Epsilon chapter of Chi Psi at the [[University of Michigan]] in 1845, leading to a tradition in that fraternity to name its buildings \"lodges\". As fraternity membership was punishable by expulsion at many colleges at this time, the house was located deep in the woods.<ref>{{Citation\n| last = Birdseye\n| first = Clarence Frank\n| title = Individual Training in Our Colleges\n| place = New York\n| publisher = The MacMillan Company\n| year = 1907\n| page = 211\n| url = https://books.google.com/?id=Bv7ZFGz9MCYC\n| accessdate = 2008-06-20}}</ref> The first residential chapter home, built by a fraternity, is believed to have been [[Alpha Delta Phi|Alpha Delta Phi's]] chapter at [[Cornell University|Cornell]], with groundbreaking dated to 1878.<ref>[http://www.alphadeltaphi.org/AboutUs/Chapters/tabid/59/agentType/View/ChapterID/12/Default.aspx Chapter History] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160826152136/http://www.alphadeltaphi.org/AboutUs/Chapters/tabid/59/agentType/View/ChapterID/12/Default.aspx |date=2016-08-26 }}, accessed 16 October 2015.

The Adelphean, founded in 1851 eventually became [[Alpha Delta Pi]], while The Philomathean, begun in 1852, eventually became [[Phi Mu]]. Together, these sororities are known as the \"Macon Magnolias\". Several other unrelated \"Philomathean Societies\" emerged during the 19th Century, most notably a literary society at UPenn and another, unrelated, at NYU.</ref> though fraternity-like organizations for women didn't take their current form until the establishment of [[Pi Beta Phi]] in 1867 and [[Kappa Alpha Theta]] in 1870. The term \"sorority\" was invented by a professor of Latin who felt the word \"fraternity\" was inappropriate for a group of ladies. The first organization to use the term \"sorority\" was [[Gamma Phi Beta]], established in 1874.<ref name=\"bairdtwo\"/>\n\nThe development of \"fraternities for women\" during this time was a major accomplishment in the way of women's rights and equality. By mere existence, these organizations were defying the odds; the founding women were able to advance their organizations despite many factors working against them. The first \"Women's Fraternities\" not only had to overcome \"restrictive social customs, unequal status under the law and the underlying presumption that they were less able than men,\"<ref>{{Cite web|url = https://www.npcwomen.org/resources/pdf/Adventures%20in%20Friendship.pdf|title = Adventure in Friendship: A History of The National Panhellenic Conference|date = |accessdate = October 12, 2015|website = National Panhellenic Conference|publisher = National Panhellenic Conference|last = |first = |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130628024619/https://www.npcwomen.org/resources/pdf/Adventures%20in%20Friendship.pdf|archive-date = June 28, 2013|url-status = dead}}</ref> but at the same time had to deal with the same challenges as fraternities with college administrations. Today, both social and multicultural sororities are present on more than 650 college campuses across the United States and Canada. The [[National Panhellenic Conference]] (NPC) serves as the \"umbrella organization\" for 26 (inter)national sororities. Founded in 1902, the NPC is one of the oldest and largest women's membership organizations, representing more than 4 million women at 655 college/university campuses and 4,500 local alumnae chapters in the U.S. and Canada.<ref name=\"about npc\">{{cite web|url=http://www.npcwomen.org/about.aspx|title=National Panhellenic Conference|publisher=National Panhellenic Conference|accessdate=2010-01-01|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090126110021/http://npcwomen.org/about.aspx|archive-date=2009-01-26|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===Internationalization===\nIn 1867, the [[Chi Phi]] fraternity established its Theta chapter at the [[University of Edinburgh]] in [[Scotland]], marking the first foray of the American social fraternity outside the borders of the United States. At the time, many students from the [[American south]] were moving to Europe to study because of the disrepair southern universities fell into during the [[American Civil War]]. One such group of Americans organized Chi Phi at Edinburgh; however, during the Theta chapter's existence, it initiated no non-American members. With declining American enrollment at European universities, Chi Phi at Edinburgh closed in 1870.<ref name=bairdtwo>{{cite book |last=Anson |first=Jack |date=1991 |title=Baird's Manual of American College Fraternities (20th Edition) |url= |location= |publisher=Bairds Manual Foundation |page=III-32 |isbn=978-0963715906 |accessdate= }}</ref>\n\n[[File:SigEpFlagIraq.jpg|thumb|right|U.S. Air Force, Airmen, presumably members of [[Sigma Phi Epsilon]], display that fraternity's flag in Iraq in 2009.]]\nNine years following Chi Phi's abortive colonization of the University of Edinburgh, a second attempt was made to transplant the fraternity system outside the United States. In 1879, [[Zeta Psi]] established a chapter at the [[University of Toronto]]. Zeta Psi's success at Toronto prompted it to open a second Canadian chapter at [[McGill University]], which it chartered in 1883. Other early foundations were [[Kappa Alpha Society]] at Toronto in 1892 and at McGill in 1899, and [[Alpha Delta Phi]] at Toronto in 1893 and at McGill in 1897. The first sorority, [[Kappa Alpha Theta]], was established at Toronto in 1887. By 1927 there were 42 fraternity and sorority chapters at the University of Toronto and of 23 at McGill University. A few chapters were also reported at the [[University of British Columbia]], [[Carleton University]], [[Dalhousie University]], [[University of Manitoba]], [[Queen's University at Kingston|Queen's University]], [[University of Western Ontario]], [[Wilfrid Laurier University]], [[University of Waterloo]] and [[Brock University]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://faculty.marianopolis.edu/c.belanger/quebechistory/encyclopedia/FraternitiesinCanada.htm |title=Fraternities in Canada |accessdate=2010-08-19 |encyclopedia=The Encyclopedia of Canada, Vol. II |publisher=University Associates of Canada |year=1948}}</ref>\n\nThe arrival of the fraternity system in Asia accompanied the introduction of the American educational system in the Philippines. The first fraternities were established in the [[University of the Philippines]]. The now defunct Patriotic and Progressive Rizal Center Academic Brotherhood (Rizal Center Fraternity), a brotherhood of Jose Rizal followers, was founded in 1913.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://xiaochua.net/2013/06/19/xiao-time-18-june-2013-ika-105-na-anibersaryo-ng-unibersidad-ng-pilipinas/ |title=XIAO TIME, 18 June 2013: Ika-105 na Anibersaryo ng Unibersidad ng Pilipinas | accessdate=2018-08-09|date=2013-06-19 }}</ref> This was followed by the Rizal Center Sorority.

While these limitations have since been abolished by both the [[Interfraternity Conference]] and the [[National Pan-Hellenic Council]], students of various ethnicities have come together to form a council of multicultural Greek organizations. The Multicultural Greek Council, officially formed in 1998, is a coordinating body of 19 Greek organizations, including nine fraternities, and ten sororities with cultural affiliations.<ref>{{cite web|title=History of MGC|url=http://mgc.tamu.edu/history|website=Multicultural Greek Council|publisher=Multicultural Greek Council|accessdate=12 October 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe first multicultural sorority, Mu Sigma Upsilon, was established in November 1981 at [[Rutgers University]].<ref name=\"nationalmgc.org\">{{cite web|title=EMERGENCE OF MULTICULTURAL FRATERNAL ORGANIZATIONS|url=http://nationalmgc.org/about/|website=National Multicultural Greek Council|publisher=National Multicultural Greek Council|accessdate=12 October 2015}}</ref>  The formation of this Greek organization allowed for the emergence of a multicultural fraternity and sorority movement, giving birth to a multicultural movement.\n\n==Structure and organization==\n===Common elements===\n====Gender exclusivity====\nFraternities and sororities traditionally have been single-sex organizations, with fraternities consisting exclusively of men and sororities consisting exclusively of women. In the United States, fraternities and sororities have a statutory exemption from [[Title IX]] legislation prohibiting this type of gender exclusion within student groups, and organizations such as the [[Fraternity and Sorority Political Action Committee]] lobby to maintain it.<ref name=\"bi1\">{{cite news|title=Why One School Decided To Make All Of Its Fraternities And Sororities Co-Ed |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/trinity-college-fraternities-sororities-co-ed-2014-10|work=[[Business Insider]]|date=9 October 2014}}</ref><ref name=\"bl\">{{cite news|title=Fraternities Lobby Against Campus Rape Investigations|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-03-24/fraternities-lobby-against-campus-rape-investigations|work=[[Bloomberg News|Bloomberg]]|date=24 March 2015}}</ref>\n\nSince the mid-20th century a small number of fraternities, such as [[Alpha Theta]] and [[Lambda Lambda Lambda]], have opted to become co-educational and admit female members; however, these generally represent a minority of Greek-letter organizations and no such fraternity is currently a member of the North American Interfraternity Conference, the largest international association of fraternities.<ref name=\"bi1\" /><ref name=\"bl\" />  The first coed fraternity was Pi Alpha Tau (1963\u20131991) at the [[University of Illinois at Chicago]].<ref>{{Cite web|title = Pi Alpha Tau Papers, 1963\u20131991, UIC Archives|url = http://findingaids.library.uic.edu/ead/lhsc/059-07-16.pdf|website = uic.edu|accessdate = 6 April 2012}}</ref>\n\nMuch more commonly, coed fraternities exist in the form of \"service\" fraternities such as [[Alpha Phi Omega]], [[Epsilon Sigma Alpha]], Alpha Tau Mu [[Service fraternities and sororities|and others]]. These organizations are similar to \"social\" fraternities and sororities, with the exception of being coed and non-residential.\n\nIn 2016, [[Chi Phi]] began allowing transgender members, or those identifying as male, to join the social fraternity.<ref>http://college.usatoday.com/2016/07/08/chi-phi-transgender-pledges/</ref> Several sororities have adjusted their policies to confirm that transgender prospective members are allowable.\n\nImportantly, all these variants have stemmed from a process of ''self-determination,'' without challenge by other Greeks. But in a [[bellwether]] case, in 2016 Harvard University changed its student conduct code to bar members of single-sex groups from leading campus groups, serving as captains of sports teams or participating in valuable academic fellowships. This clear and unprecedented attempt to eliminate the gender exclusivity that is typically associated with the fraternity and sorority culture is being contested vigorously in U.S. Federal Court by several affected fraternities and sororities, with the support of the broader Greek Life community.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/united-states/2019/01/17/harvards-policy-against-single-sex-clubs-was-meant-to-protect-women|title=Harvard's policy against single-sex clubs was meant to protect women|date=2019-01-17|work=The Economist|access-date=2019-01-28|issn=0013-0613}}</ref><ref>[https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/harvard-sued-fraternities-sororities-over-single-sex-rule-n942961 Harvard sued by fraternities and sororities], in an NBC news report dated 3 Dec 2018, accessed 2 Aug 2019.</ref>\n\n====Governance====\nIndividual chapters of fraternities and sororities are largely self-governed by their active (student) members; however, alumni members may retain legal ownership of the fraternity or sorority's property through an alumni chapter or alumni corporation. All of a single fraternity or sorority's chapters are generally grouped together in a national or international organization that sets standards, regulates insignia and ritual, publishes a journal or magazine for all of the chapters of the organization, and has the power to grant and revoke charters to chapters. These federal structures are largely governed by alumni members of the fraternity, though with some input from the active (student) members.<ref>{{cite web|title=GOVERNANCE OF UNDERGRADUATE SOCIAL FRATERNITIES AND SORORITIES|url=http://provost.upenn.edu/policies/pennbook/2013/02/15/recognition-and-governance-of-undergraduate-social-fraternities-and-sororities|website=upenn.edu|publisher=[[University of Pennsylvania]]|accessdate=4 September 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170727030604/http://provost.upenn.edu/policies/pennbook/2013/02/15/recognition-and-governance-of-undergraduate-social-fraternities-and-sororities|archive-date=27 July 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=ERM, ORSA and Corporate Governance: The Small Company Challenges|url=http://www.firstconsulting.com/erm-orsa-and-corporate-governance-small-company-challenges|website=firstconsulting.com|publisher=First Consulting}}</ref>\n\n====Rushing and pledging (recruitment and new member periods)====\n{{See also|Sorority recruitment}}\n[[File:Adphicornell.jpg|thumb|left|The chapter house of [[Alpha Delta Phi]] at [[Cornell University]]]]\n[[File:Zeta Psi Fraternity House, Lafayette College 01.JPG|thumb|right|The [[Zeta Psi]] chapter house at [[Lafayette College]]]]\n[[File:Delta Upsilon Ode2.ogg|thumb|left|\"Delta Upsilon Ode,\" a traditional [[Delta Upsilon]] song written in 1884 by Edward La Wall Seip (sample)]]\n[[File:\"My Name is Sigma Chi, Sir\".ogg|thumb|right|\"My Name is Sigma Chi, Sir,\" a traditional [[Sigma Chi]] song written in 1885 by Charles Eldridge (sample)]]\nMost Greek letter organizations select potential members through a two-part process of vetting and probation, called rushing and pledging, respectively. During rush (recruitment), students attend designated social events, and sometimes formal interviews, hosted by the chapters of fraternities and sororities in which they have particular interest. Usually, after a potential new member has attended several such events, officers or current members meet privately to vote on whether or not to extend an invitation (known as a \"bid\") to the prospective applicant. Those applicants who receive a bid, and choose to accept it, are considered to have \"pledged\" the fraternity or sorority, thus beginning the pledge period (new member period). Students participating in rush are known as \"rushees\" (Potential New Members \"PNMs\") while students who have accepted a bid to a specific fraternity or sorority are known as \"new members\" or in some cases \"pledges\".<ref name=tfa>{{cite web|title=Rush and Pledging Problems|url=http://thefraternityadvisor.com/rush-and-pledging-problems/|website=The Fraternity Advisor|accessdate=2 September 2015}}</ref>\n\nA new member period may last anywhere from one weekend to several months. During this time, new members might participate in almost all aspects of the life of the fraternity or sorority, but most likely not be permitted to hold office in the organization. At the conclusion of the new member period, a second vote of members may sometimes be taken, often, but not always, using a [[blackballing|blackball]] system. New members who pass this second vote are invited to a formal and secret ritual of initiation into the organization, advancing them to full membership.<ref name=handbook/>\n\nMany Greek-letter organizations give preferential consideration for pledging to candidates whose parent or sibling was a member of the same fraternity or sorority. Such prospective candidates are known as \"legacies\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gmu.edu/org/ifc/faq_glossary.htm |title=Glossary of Greek Life Terms |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= |website=gmu.edu |publisher=George Mason University Interfraternity Council |accessdate=28 December 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150325043212/http://www.gmu.edu/org/ifc/faq_glossary.htm |archive-date=25 March 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://thefraternityadvisor.com/fraternity-legacy/ |title=Fraternity Legacies |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= |website=thefraternityadvisor.com |publisher=The Fraternity Advisor |accessdate=28 December 2014}}</ref>\n\nMembership in more than one fraternity or sorority is almost always prohibited. Recently, some Greek-letter organizations have replaced the term \"pledge\" with that of \"associate member\" or \"new member\".  [[Sigma Alpha Epsilon]], in 2014, abolished pledging altogether. Potential members are now immediately initiated into the fraternity upon accepting a bid.<ref name=tfa/><ref>{{cite news|title=Deadliest U.S. Fraternity Abolishes Pledging for New Members|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-03-07/most-deadly-u-s-fraternity-scraps-initiation-for-new-members|work=[[Bloomberg News|Bloomberg]]|issue=7 March 2014}}</ref>\n\n====Residency====\nUnique among most campus organizations, members of social Greek letter organizations often live together in a large house (generally privately owned by the fraternity itself, or by the fraternity's alumni association) or a distinct part of the university dormitories. A single undergraduate fraternity chapter may be composed of anywhere between 20 and more than 100 students, though most have between 35 and 45 members and pledges. Often fraternities and sorority houses (called lodges or chapter houses) are located on the same street or in close quarters within the same neighborhood, which may be colloquially known as \"Greek row\" or \"frat row\". At some, often small, colleges, fraternities and sororities occupy a specific section of university-owned housing provided to them. Some fraternities and sororities are un-housed, with members providing for their own accommodations. In many of these cases, the fraternity or sorority own or rent a non-residential clubhouse to use for meetings and other activities.\n\n====Secrecy and ritual====\n[[File:Phi Kappa Sigma 1872 W&J College.jpg|thumb|left|Members of [[Phi Kappa Sigma]] at [[Washington & Jefferson College]] in 1872]]\n[[File:Fraternity Initiation.png|thumb|right|A dramatized depiction of a fraternity initiation ritual]]\n[[File:The Model Chapter Room (526839509).jpg|thumb|A \"model chapter room\" of [[Kappa Sigma]]]]\n\nWith a few exceptions, most fraternities and sororities are secret societies. While the identity of members or officers is rarely concealed, fraternities and sororities initiate members following the pledge period through sometimes elaborate private rituals, frequently drawn or adopted from Masonic ritual practice or that of the Greek mysteries.<ref name=handbook/>\n\nAt the conclusion of an initiation ritual, the organization's secret motto, secret purpose and secret identification signs, such as handshakes and passwords, are usually revealed to its new members.

Entry into chapter rooms is often prohibited to all but the initiated. In one extreme case, the response of firefighters to a blaze signaled by an automated alarm at the [[Sigma Phi]] chapter house at the [[University of Wisconsin]] in 2003 was hampered in part because fraternity members refused to disclose the location of the hidden chapter room, where the conflagration had erupted, to emergency responders.<ref>{{cite news|title=Bizarre fire burns frat house; blaze startedin secret room|url=http://journaltimes.com/news/local/bizarre-fire-burns-frat-house-blaze-startedin-secret-room/article_255dacac-4f82-5a4d-9f83-99116987231d.html|accessdate=2 September 2015|work=Journal Times|date=27 September 2003}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Assistant Professor Caroline Rolland-Diamond of the [[Paris West University Nanterre La D\u00e9fense]], in one ritual popular in the 1960s, born out of frustration to the [[counterculture of the 1960s|ubiquitous nascent counterculture]], \"The men were stripped to their underpants, tied up to a tree, and covered in a nasty mix of food and leaves, remaining there until their fianc\u00e9es came to free them with a kiss.\"<ref name=\"rollandiamondanotherside\">{{cite journal|last1=Rolland-Diamond|first1=Caroline|title=Another Side of the Sixties: Festive Practices on College Campuses and the Making of a Conservative Youth Movement|journal=Revue Fran\u00e7aise d'\u00c9tudes Am\u00e9ricaines|date=2016|volume=1|issue=146|pages=39\u201353|url=http://www.cairn.info/article.php?ID_ARTICLE=RFEA_146_0039&WT.mc_id=RFEA_146|accessdate=October 24, 2016|via=[[Cairn.info]]|url-access=registration }}</ref>\n\n====Symbols and naming conventions====\nThe fraternity or sorority badge is an enduring symbol of membership in a Greek letter organization. Most fraternities also have assumed heraldic achievements. Members of fraternities and sororities address members of the same organization as \"brother\" (in the case of fraternities) or \"sister\" (in the case of sororities). The names of almost all fraternities and sororities consist of a sequence of two or three Greek letters, for instance, [[Delta Delta Delta]], [[Sigma Chi]], [[Chi Omega]], or [[Psi Upsilon]].

Hazing during the pledge period can sometimes culminate in an event commonly known as \"Hell Week\" in which a week-long series of physical and mental torments are inflicted on pledges. Common hazing practices include sleep deprivation, sensory deprivation, [[Paddle (spanking)|paddling]] and other types of spanking, use of [[stress positions]], forced runs, [[Busy work#Military settings|busy work]], forced drinking and [[mind games]]. Rarer incidents involving [[human branding|branding]], [[enemas]], urination on pledges and the forced consumption of [[spoiled food]] have been reported. Hazing, in many cases, has been reported and has led to the permanent disposal of particular chapters of fraternities and sororities across the country.\n\n[[File:Flying Machine.jpg|thumb|left|A depiction of fraternity hazing from the early 20th century]]\nSupporters of fraternities note that hazing is almost universally prohibited by national fraternity organizations, and the occurrence of hazing in undergraduate fraternity chapters goes against official policy. Supporters of fraternities also note that hazing is not unique to Greek-letter organizations and is often reported in other student organizations, such as athletic teams.\n\nIn 2007, an anti-hazing hotline was set up to report incidents of hazing on college campuses. Currently, 46 national fraternity and sorority organizations support the toll-free number, which generates automatic email messages regarding hazing and sends them to the national headquarters directly from the National Anti-Hazing Hotline.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Fraternal Law \u00bb Anti-Hazing Hotline|url = http://fraternallaw.com/contact/anti-hazing-hotline/|website = fraternallaw.com|accessdate = 2015-10-04|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20151027112504/http://fraternallaw.com/contact/anti-hazing-hotline/|archive-date = 2015-10-27|url-status = dead}}</ref> Every year, the last week of September is considered to be National Hazing Prevention Week (NHPW). From hazingprevention.org, \"NHPW is an opportunity for campuses, schools, communities, organizations and individuals to raise awareness about the problem of hazing, educating others about hazing, and promoting the prevention of hazing.

Two additional types of fraternities, professional fraternities and honor societies, incorporate some limited elements of traditional fraternity organization, but are generally considered a different type of association. Traditional fraternities of the type described in this article are often called \"social fraternities\".\n\nGenerally, membership in a fraternity or sorority is obtained as an [[Undergraduate education|undergraduate]] [[Higher education|student]] but continues, thereafter, for life. Some of these organizations can accept [[Graduate school|graduate]] students as well as undergraduates, per constitutional provisions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.phikappatau.org/learning/chapter-management/constitution-and-bylaws.html|title=For example, Phi Kappa Tau and Alpha Xi Delta both have provisions in their respective Constitutions that they can accept graduate students as well as undergraduates|publisher=|access-date=2015-11-16|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160306131926/http://phikappatau.org/learning/chapter-management/constitution-and-bylaws.html|archive-date=2016-03-06|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.alphaxidelta.org/clientuploads/Academic/2012%20Academic%20Achievement%20Chair%20Breakout%20Workbook.pdf|title=Alpha Xi Delta|publisher=|access-date=2015-11-16|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170703134737/http://www.alphaxidelta.org/clientuploads/Academic/2012%20Academic%20Achievement%20Chair%20Breakout%20Workbook.pdf|archive-date=2017-07-03|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nIndividual fraternities and sororities vary in organization and purpose, but most share five common elements:\n\n# [[#Secrecy and ritual|Secrecy]]\n# [[#Gender exclusivity|Single-sex membership]]\n# [[#Rushing and pledging (recruitment and new member periods)|Selection]] of new members on the basis of a two-part vetting and probationary process known as ''rushing'' and ''pledging''\n# Ownership and occupancy of a [[#Residency|residential property]] where undergraduate members live\n# A set of complex identification symbols that may include Greek letters, [[armorial achievement]]s, ciphers, badges, grips, hand signs, passwords, flowers and colors\n\nFraternities and sororities engage in philanthropic activities, host parties, provide \"finishing\" training for new members such as instruction on etiquette, dress and manners, and create networking opportunities for their newly graduated members.\n\n==History==\n{{further|Fraternity#History}}\n\n===Establishment and early history===\n[[File:Rear view of the Wren Building, College of William & Mary in Williamsburg, Virginia, USA (2008-04-23).jpg|thumb|The fraternity system in North America began at the [[College of William and Mary]] in 1750.]]\n\nThe first fraternity in North America to incorporate most of the elements of modern fraternities was [[Phi Beta Kappa]], founded at the [[College of William and Mary]] in 1775. The founding of Phi Beta Kappa followed the earlier establishment of two other secret student societies that had existed at that campus as early as 1750. In 1779 Phi Beta Kappa expanded to include chapters at Harvard and Yale.  By the early 19th century, the organization transformed itself into a scholastic honor society and abandoned secrecy.\n\nIn 1825, [[Kappa Alpha Society]], the oldest extant fraternity to retain its social characteristic, was established at [[Union College]]. In 1827, [[Sigma Phi]] and [[Delta Phi]] were also founded at the same institution,<ref name=handbook>{{cite book|last1=Whalen|first1=Richard|title=Handbook of Secret Organizations|date=1967|publisher=Bruce Publishing Company|location=Milwaukee|pages=43\u201345}}</ref> creating the [[Union Triad]]. The further birthing of [[Psi Upsilon]] (1833), [[Chi Psi]] (1841) and [[Theta Delta Chi]] (1847) collectively established Union College as the [[Mother of Fraternities]].\nThe social fraternity [[Chi Phi]], although officially formed in 1854, traces its roots to 1824,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://chiphi.dynamic.omegafi.com/about-chi-phi/|title=History of Chi Phi|author=|date=|website=www.chiphi.org|accessdate=14 March 2019}}</ref> and oldest.org considers it the oldest social fraternity.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oldest.org/culture/fraternities-north-america/|title=7 Oldest Fraternities in North America|author=|date=|website=www.oldest.org|accessdate=14 March 2019}}</ref>\n\nFraternities represented the intersection between [[dining club]]s, [[College literary societies|literary societies]] and secret initiatory orders such as [[Freemasonry]]. Their early growth was widely opposed by university administrators, though the increasing influence of fraternity alumni, as well as several high-profile court cases, succeeded in largely muting opposition by the 1880s.<ref name=\"handbook\"/> The first fraternity meeting hall, or lodge, seems to have been that of the Alpha Epsilon chapter of Chi Psi at the [[University of Michigan]] in 1845, leading to a tradition in that fraternity to name its buildings \"lodges\".

The Adelphean, founded in 1851 eventually became [[Alpha Delta Pi]], while The Philomathean, begun in 1852, eventually became [[Phi Mu]]. Together, these sororities are known as the \"Macon Magnolias\". Several other unrelated \"Philomathean Societies\" emerged during the 19th Century, most notably a literary society at UPenn and another, unrelated, at NYU.</ref> though fraternity-like organizations for women didn't take their current form until the establishment of [[Pi Beta Phi]] in 1867 and [[Kappa Alpha Theta]] in 1870. The term \"sorority\" was invented by a professor of Latin who felt the word \"fraternity\" was inappropriate for a group of ladies. The first organization to use the term \"sorority\" was [[Gamma Phi Beta]], established in 1874.<ref name=\"bairdtwo\"/>\n\nThe development of \"fraternities for women\" during this time was a major accomplishment in the way of women's rights and equality. By mere existence, these organizations were defying the odds; the founding women were able to advance their organizations despite many factors working against them.

Today, both social and multicultural sororities are present on more than 650 college campuses across the United States and Canada. The [[National Panhellenic Conference]] (NPC) serves as the \"umbrella organization\" for 26 (inter)national sororities. Founded in 1902, the NPC is one of the oldest and largest women's membership organizations, representing more than 4 million women at 655 college/university campuses and 4,500 local alumnae chapters in the U.S. and Canada.<ref name=\"about npc\">{{cite web|url=http://www.npcwomen.org/about.aspx|title=National Panhellenic Conference|publisher=National Panhellenic Conference|accessdate=2010-01-01|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090126110021/http://npcwomen.org/about.aspx|archive-date=2009-01-26|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===Internationalization===\nIn 1867, the [[Chi Phi]] fraternity established its Theta chapter at the [[University of Edinburgh]] in [[Scotland]], marking the first foray of the American social fraternity outside the borders of the United States. At the time, many students from the [[American south]] were moving to Europe to study because of the disrepair southern universities fell into during the [[American Civil War]]. One such group of Americans organized Chi Phi at Edinburgh; however, during the Theta chapter's existence, it initiated no non-American members. With declining American enrollment at European universities, Chi Phi at Edinburgh closed in 1870.<ref name=bairdtwo>{{cite book |last=Anson |first=Jack |date=1991 |title=Baird's Manual of American College Fraternities (20th Edition) |url= |location= |publisher=Bairds Manual Foundation |page=III-32 |isbn=978-0963715906 |accessdate= }}</ref>\n\n[[File:SigEpFlagIraq.jpg|thumb|right|U.S. Air Force, Airmen, presumably members of [[Sigma Phi Epsilon]], display that fraternity's flag in Iraq in 2009.]]\nNine years following Chi Phi's abortive colonization of the University of Edinburgh, a second attempt was made to transplant the fraternity system outside the United States. In 1879, [[Zeta Psi]] established a chapter at the [[University of Toronto]]. Zeta Psi's success at Toronto prompted it to open a second Canadian chapter at [[McGill University]], which it chartered in 1883. Other early foundations were [[Kappa Alpha Society]] at Toronto in 1892 and at McGill in 1899, and [[Alpha Delta Phi]] at Toronto in 1893 and at McGill in 1897. The first sorority, [[Kappa Alpha Theta]], was established at Toronto in 1887. By 1927 there were 42 fraternity and sorority chapters at the University of Toronto and of 23 at McGill University. A few chapters were also reported at the [[University of British Columbia]], [[Carleton University]], [[Dalhousie University]], [[University of Manitoba]], [[Queen's University at Kingston|Queen's University]], [[University of Western Ontario]], [[Wilfrid Laurier University]], [[University of Waterloo]] and [[Brock University]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://faculty.marianopolis.edu/c.belanger/quebechistory/encyclopedia/FraternitiesinCanada.htm |title=Fraternities in Canada |accessdate=2010-08-19 |encyclopedia=The Encyclopedia of Canada, Vol. II |publisher=University Associates of Canada |year=1948}}</ref>\n\nThe arrival of the fraternity system in Asia accompanied the introduction of the American educational system in the Philippines.

While these limitations have since been abolished by both the [[Interfraternity Conference]] and the [[National Pan-Hellenic Council]], students of various ethnicities have come together to form a council of multicultural Greek organizations. The Multicultural Greek Council, officially formed in 1998, is a coordinating body of 19 Greek organizations, including nine fraternities, and ten sororities with cultural affiliations.<ref>{{cite web|title=History of MGC|url=http://mgc.tamu.edu/history|website=Multicultural Greek Council|publisher=Multicultural Greek Council|accessdate=12 October 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe first multicultural sorority, Mu Sigma Upsilon, was established in November 1981 at [[Rutgers University]].<ref name=\"nationalmgc.org\">{{cite web|title=EMERGENCE OF MULTICULTURAL FRATERNAL ORGANIZATIONS|url=http://nationalmgc.org/about/|website=National Multicultural Greek Council|publisher=National Multicultural Greek Council|accessdate=12 October 2015}}</ref>  The formation of this Greek organization allowed for the emergence of a multicultural fraternity and sorority movement, giving birth to a multicultural movement.\n\n==Structure and organization==\n===Common elements===\n====Gender exclusivity====\nFraternities and sororities traditionally have been single-sex organizations, with fraternities consisting exclusively of men and sororities consisting exclusively of women. In the United States, fraternities and sororities have a statutory exemption from [[Title IX]] legislation prohibiting this type of gender exclusion within student groups, and organizations such as the [[Fraternity and Sorority Political Action Committee]] lobby to maintain it.<ref name=\"bi1\">{{cite news|title=Why One School Decided To Make All Of Its Fraternities And Sororities Co-Ed |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/trinity-college-fraternities-sororities-co-ed-2014-10|work=[[Business Insider]]|date=9 October 2014}}</ref><ref name=\"bl\">{{cite news|title=Fraternities Lobby Against Campus Rape Investigations|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-03-24/fraternities-lobby-against-campus-rape-investigations|work=[[Bloomberg News|Bloomberg]]|date=24 March 2015}}</ref>\n\nSince the mid-20th century a small number of fraternities, such as [[Alpha Theta]] and [[Lambda Lambda Lambda]], have opted to become co-educational and admit female members; however, these generally represent a minority of Greek-letter organizations and no such fraternity is currently a member of the North American Interfraternity Conference, the largest international association of fraternities.<ref name=\"bi1\" /><ref name=\"bl\" />  The first coed fraternity was Pi Alpha Tau (1963\u20131991) at the [[University of Illinois at Chicago]].<ref>{{Cite web|title = Pi Alpha Tau Papers, 1963\u20131991, UIC Archives|url = http://findingaids.library.uic.edu/ead/lhsc/059-07-16.pdf|website = uic.edu|accessdate = 6 April 2012}}</ref>\n\nMuch more commonly, coed fraternities exist in the form of \"service\" fraternities such as [[Alpha Phi Omega]], [[Epsilon Sigma Alpha]], Alpha Tau Mu [[Service fraternities and sororities|and others]]. These organizations are similar to \"social\" fraternities and sororities, with the exception of being coed and non-residential.\n\nIn 2016, [[Chi Phi]] began allowing transgender members, or those identifying as male, to join the social fraternity.<ref>http://college.usatoday.com/2016/07/08/chi-phi-transgender-pledges/</ref> Several sororities have adjusted their policies to confirm that transgender prospective members are allowable.\n\nImportantly, all these variants have stemmed from a process of ''self-determination,'' without challenge by other Greeks. But in a [[bellwether]] case, in 2016 Harvard University changed its student conduct code to bar members of single-sex groups from leading campus groups, serving as captains of sports teams or participating in valuable academic fellowships. This clear and unprecedented attempt to eliminate the gender exclusivity that is typically associated with the fraternity and sorority culture is being contested vigorously in U.S. Federal Court by several affected fraternities and sororities, with the support of the broader Greek Life community.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/united-states/2019/01/17/harvards-policy-against-single-sex-clubs-was-meant-to-protect-women|title=Harvard's policy against single-sex clubs was meant to protect women|date=2019-01-17|work=The Economist|access-date=2019-01-28|issn=0013-0613}}</ref><ref>[https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/harvard-sued-fraternities-sororities-over-single-sex-rule-n942961 Harvard sued by fraternities and sororities], in an NBC news report dated 3 Dec 2018, accessed 2 Aug 2019.</ref>\n\n====Governance====\nIndividual chapters of fraternities and sororities are largely self-governed by their active (student) members; however, alumni members may retain legal ownership of the fraternity or sorority's property through an alumni chapter or alumni corporation. All of a single fraternity or sorority's chapters are generally grouped together in a national or international organization that sets standards, regulates insignia and ritual, publishes a journal or magazine for all of the chapters of the organization, and has the power to grant and revoke charters to chapters.

During rush (recruitment), students attend designated social events, and sometimes formal interviews, hosted by the chapters of fraternities and sororities in which they have particular interest. Usually, after a potential new member has attended several such events, officers or current members meet privately to vote on whether or not to extend an invitation (known as a \"bid\") to the prospective applicant. Those applicants who receive a bid, and choose to accept it, are considered to have \"pledged\" the fraternity or sorority, thus beginning the pledge period (new member period). Students participating in rush are known as \"rushees\" (Potential New Members \"PNMs\") while students who have accepted a bid to a specific fraternity or sorority are known as \"new members\" or in some cases \"pledges\".<ref name=tfa>{{cite web|title=Rush and Pledging Problems|url=http://thefraternityadvisor.com/rush-and-pledging-problems/|website=The Fraternity Advisor|accessdate=2 September 2015}}</ref>\n\nA new member period may last anywhere from one weekend to several months. During this time, new members might participate in almost all aspects of the life of the fraternity or sorority, but most likely not be permitted to hold office in the organization. At the conclusion of the new member period, a second vote of members may sometimes be taken, often, but not always, using a [[blackballing|blackball]] system. New members who pass this second vote are invited to a formal and secret ritual of initiation into the organization, advancing them to full membership.<ref name=handbook/>\n\n\nMany Greek-letter organizations give preferential consideration for pledging to candidates whose parent or sibling was a member of the same fraternity or sorority. Such prospective candidates are known as \"legacies\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gmu.edu/org/ifc/faq_glossary.htm |title=Glossary of Greek Life Terms |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= |website=gmu.edu |publisher=George Mason University Interfraternity Council |accessdate=28 December 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150325043212/http://www.gmu.edu/org/ifc/faq_glossary.htm |archive-date=25 March 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://thefraternityadvisor.com/fraternity-legacy/ |title=Fraternity Legacies |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= |website=thefraternityadvisor.com |publisher=The Fraternity Advisor |accessdate=28 December 2014}}</ref>\n\nMembership in more than one fraternity or sorority is almost always prohibited. Recently, some Greek-letter organizations have replaced the term \"pledge\" with that of \"associate member\" or \"new member\".  [[Sigma Alpha Epsilon]], in 2014, abolished pledging altogether.

A single undergraduate fraternity chapter may be composed of anywhere between 20 and more than 100 students, though most have between 35 and 45 members and pledges. Often fraternities and sorority houses (called lodges or chapter houses) are located on the same street or in close quarters within the same neighborhood, which may be colloquially known as \"Greek row\" or \"frat row\". At some, often small, colleges, fraternities and sororities occupy a specific section of university-owned housing provided to them. Some fraternities and sororities are un-housed, with members providing for their own accommodations. In many of these cases, the fraternity or sorority own or rent a non-residential clubhouse to use for meetings and other activities. \n\n====Secrecy and ritual====\n[[File:Phi Kappa Sigma 1872 W&J College.jpg|thumb|left|Members of [[Phi Kappa Sigma]] at [[Washington & Jefferson College]] in 1872]]\n[[File:Fraternity Initiation.png|thumb|right|A dramatized depiction of a fraternity initiation ritual]]\n[[File:The Model Chapter Room (526839509).jpg|thumb|A \"model chapter room\" of [[Kappa Sigma]]]]\n\nWith a few exceptions, most fraternities and sororities are secret societies. While the identity of members or officers is rarely concealed, fraternities and sororities initiate members following the pledge period through sometimes elaborate private rituals, frequently drawn or adopted from Masonic ritual practice or that of the Greek mysteries.<ref name=handbook/>\n\nAt the conclusion of an initiation ritual, the organization's secret motto, secret purpose and secret identification signs, such as handshakes and passwords, are usually revealed to its new members.

Most fraternities also have assumed heraldic achievements. Members of fraternities and sororities address members of the same organization as \"brother\" (in the case of fraternities) or \"sister\" (in the case of sororities). The names of almost all fraternities and sororities consist of a sequence of two or three Greek letters, for instance, [[Delta Delta Delta]], [[Sigma Chi]], [[Chi Omega]], or [[Psi Upsilon]].

Hazing during the pledge period can sometimes culminate in an event commonly known as \"Hell Week\" in which a week-long series of physical and mental torments are inflicted on pledges. Common hazing practices include sleep deprivation, sensory deprivation, [[Paddle (spanking)|paddling]] and other types of spanking, use of [[stress positions]], forced runs, [[Busy work#Military settings|busy work]], forced drinking and [[mind games]]. Rarer incidents involving [[human branding|branding]], [[enemas]], urination on pledges and the forced consumption of [[spoiled food]] have been reported. Hazing, in many cases, has been reported and has led to the permanent disposal of particular chapters of fraternities and sororities across the country.\n\n[[File:Flying Machine.jpg|thumb|left|A depiction of fraternity hazing from the early 20th century]]\nSupporters of fraternities note that hazing is almost universally prohibited by national fraternity organizations, and the occurrence of hazing in undergraduate fraternity chapters goes against official policy. Supporters of fraternities also note that hazing is not unique to Greek-letter organizations and is often reported in other student organizations, such as athletic teams.\n\nIn 2007, an anti-hazing hotline was set up to report incidents of hazing on college campuses. Currently, 46 national fraternity and sorority organizations support the toll-free number, which generates automatic email messages regarding hazing and sends them to the national headquarters directly from the National Anti-Hazing Hotline.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Fraternal Law \u00bb Anti-Hazing Hotline|url = http://fraternallaw.com/contact/anti-hazing-hotline/|website = fraternallaw.com|accessdate = 2015-10-04|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20151027112504/http://fraternallaw.com/contact/anti-hazing-hotline/|archive-date = 2015-10-27|url-status = dead}}</ref> Every year, the last week of September is considered to be National Hazing Prevention Week (NHPW).

Monotype was involved in the design and production of many typefaces in the 20th century. Monotype developed many of the most widely used [[typeface design]]s, including [[Times New Roman]], [[Gill Sans]], [[Arial]], [[Bembo]] and [[Albertus (typeface)|Albertus]].\n\nVia acquisitions of [[Linotype GmbH]], [[International Typeface Corporation]], [[Bitstream Inc.]] and [[FontShop]], the company gained the rights to fonts including [[Helvetica]], [[Franklin Gothic#ITC Franklin Gothic|ITC Franklin Gothic]], [[Optima]], [[ITC Avant Garde]], [[Palatino]] and [[FF DIN]]. It also owns [[MyFonts]], used by many independent font design studios. The company is owned by HGGC, a [[private equity firm]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Monotype System===\n{{Main article|Monotype System}}\n[[File:Monotype-machine.jpg|thumb|right|Monotype caster]]\nThe Lanston Monotype Machine Company was founded by [[Tolbert Lanston]] in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]], in 1887. Lanston had a patented mechanical method of punching out metal types from cold strips of metal which were set (hence ''typesetting'') into a [[Matrix (printing)|matrix]] for the [[printing press]]. In 1896 Lanston patented the first [[hot metal typesetting]] machine and Monotype issued Modern Condensed, its first [[typeface]]. The licenses for the Lanston type library have been acquired by [[P22 type foundry|P22]], a digital [[type foundry]] based in [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]], New York.\n\nIn a search for funding, the company set up a branch in [[London]] in 1897 under the name Lanston Monotype Corporation Ltd, generally known as the Monotype Corporation. In 1899 a new factory was built in [[Salfords]] near [[Redhill, Surrey|Redhill]] in [[Surrey]] where it has been located for over a century. The company was of sufficient size to justify the construction of its own [[Salfords railway station]].\n\nThe Monotype machine worked by casting letters from \"hot metal\" (molten metal) as pieces of type. Thus spelling mistakes could be corrected by adding or removing individual letters. This was particularly useful for \"quality\" printing - such as books. In contrast, the [[Linotype machine]] formed a complete line of type in one bar. Editing these required replacing an entire line (and if the replacement ran onto another line, the rest of the paragraph). But Linotype slugs were easier to handle if moving a complete section of text around a page. This was more useful for \"quick\" printing - such as newspapers.\n\nThe typesetting machines were continually improved in the early years of the 20th century, with a [[typewriter]] style [[Alphanumeric keyboard|keyboard]] for entering the type being introduced in 1906. This arrangement addressed the need to vary the space between words so that all lines were the same length.\n\nThe keyboard operator types the copy, each key punching holes in a roll of paper tape that will control the separate caster. A drum on the keyboard indicates to the operator the space required for each line. This information is also punched in the paper. Before fitting the tape to the caster it is turned over so that the first holes read on each line set the width of the variable space. The subsequent holes determine the position of a frame, or die case, that holds the set of matrices for the face being used. Each matrix is a rectangle of copper recessed with the shape of the letter. Once the matrix is positioned over the mould that forms the rest of the piece of type being cast, molten type metal is injected.\n\nTo promote its image, the company ran a magazine, the ''Monotype Recorder'', over most of the twentieth century, and also ran a [[Compositor (typesetting)|compositor]] (typesetter operator) training school in London.<ref>{{cite web|title=Monotype Recorder back issues|url=http://www.metaltype.co.uk/monotype_recorder.shtml|website=Metal Type Library collection|accessdate=12 July 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"Duffy2017\" /> In 1936, the company was floated on the [[London Stock Exchange]] and became the Monotype Corporation Ltd.

Cromas Holdings, an investment company based in Switzerland, bought the Monotype Corporation Ltd. and Monotype Inc. (excluding Monotype Typography) and five other direct subsidiary companies in France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, and Singapore. Monotype Systems Ltd. was the adopted name for the new organization with Peter Purdy as Chairman, the name Monotype was under license from Monotype Typography Ltd which retained the trademark Monotype. Monotype Systems Ltd. focused on selling [[pre-press]] software and hardware, [[raster image processor]]s and workflow.\n\nCromas Holdings reorganized its publishing interests with the formation of the International Publishing Asset Holding Ltd. effectively controlling Monotype Systems Ltd., QED Technology Ltd., and GB Techniques Ltd.\n\nThe company acquired Berthold Communications; the UK subsidiary of the German composing equipment supplier.\n\nIn June 2002, Monotype Systems Limited was re-branded, IPA Systems Limited, as this marked the end of the existing trademark licence with Monotype Corporation. In the US Monotype Inc became alfaQuest Technologies Limited. Both companies still sell pre-press software and hardware.\n\nIn 1999, [[Agfa]]-Compugraphic acquired the company, which was renamed Agfa Monotype. In late 2004, after six years under the Agfa Corporation, the Monotype assets were acquired by [[TA Associates]], a private equity investment firm based in [[Boston]]. The company was incorporated as Monotype Imaging, with a focus on the company's traditional core competencies of typography and professional printing.\n\nMonotype was the first company to produce a digital version of the handwritten [[Persian alphabet|Persian]] script, Persian [[Nasta'liq script|Nasta'liq]]. A Chinese \"keyboard\" was developed to typeset Chinese characters; it consisted of a book with a stylus. As the pages were turned, the page number was detected electrically and this was combined with the position of the character selected by the stylus on a large grid.\n\nIn 2003, the company launched Fontwise, the first software to audit desktops for licensed and unlicensed (not necessarily illegal) fonts.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20030930005093/en/Agfa-Monotype-Launches-Fontwise-Monotype-Worlds-Font | title=Agfa Monotype Launches Fontwise from Monotype, the World's First Font Licence Management Solution | publisher=[[Business Wire]] | date=September 30, 2003}}</ref>\n\nOn 2 October 2006, the company acquired Linotype GmbH, a subsidiary of [[Heidelberger Druckmaschinen]].<ref>{{cite press release | url=https://www.linotype.com/2794/monotype-imaging-acquires-linotype.html | title=MONOTYPE IMAGING ACQUIRES LINOTYPE | publisher=[[Linotype GmbH|Linotype]] | date=August 2006}}</ref>\n\nOn 18 September 2006, the company acquired China Type Design Limited, a typeface design and production company based in Hong Kong.

Monotype was involved in the design and production of many typefaces in the 20th century. Monotype developed many of the most widely used [[typeface design]]s, including [[Times New Roman]], [[Gill Sans]], [[Arial]], [[Bembo]] and [[Albertus (typeface)|Albertus]].\n\nVia acquisitions of [[Linotype GmbH]], [[International Typeface Corporation]], [[Bitstream Inc.]] and [[FontShop]], the company gained the rights to fonts including [[Helvetica]], [[Franklin Gothic#ITC Franklin Gothic|ITC Franklin Gothic]], [[Optima]], [[ITC Avant Garde]], [[Palatino]] and [[FF DIN]]. It also owns [[MyFonts]], used by many independent font design studios. The company is owned by HGGC, a [[private equity firm]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Monotype System===\n{{Main article|Monotype System}}\n[[File:Monotype-machine.jpg|thumb|right|Monotype caster]]\nThe Lanston Monotype Machine Company was founded by [[Tolbert Lanston]] in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]], in 1887. Lanston had a patented mechanical method of punching out metal types from cold strips of metal which were set (hence ''typesetting'') into a [[Matrix (printing)|matrix]] for the [[printing press]]. In 1896 Lanston patented the first [[hot metal typesetting]] machine and Monotype issued Modern Condensed, its first [[typeface]]. The licenses for the Lanston type library have been acquired by [[P22 type foundry|P22]], a digital [[type foundry]] based in [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]], New York.\n\nIn a search for funding, the company set up a branch in [[London]] in 1897 under the name Lanston Monotype Corporation Ltd, generally known as the Monotype Corporation. In 1899 a new factory was built in [[Salfords]] near [[Redhill, Surrey|Redhill]] in [[Surrey]] where it has been located for over a century. The company was of sufficient size to justify the construction of its own [[Salfords railway station]].\n\nThe Monotype machine worked by casting letters from \"hot metal\" (molten metal) as pieces of type. Thus spelling mistakes could be corrected by adding or removing individual letters. This was particularly useful for \"quality\" printing - such as books. In contrast, the [[Linotype machine]] formed a complete line of type in one bar. Editing these required replacing an entire line (and if the replacement ran onto another line, the rest of the paragraph). But Linotype slugs were easier to handle if moving a complete section of text around a page. This was more useful for \"quick\" printing - such as newspapers.\n\nThe typesetting machines were continually improved in the early years of the 20th century, with a [[typewriter]] style [[Alphanumeric keyboard|keyboard]] for entering the type being introduced in 1906. This arrangement addressed the need to vary the space between words so that all lines were the same length.\n\nThe keyboard operator types the copy, each key punching holes in a roll of paper tape that will control the separate caster. A drum on the keyboard indicates to the operator the space required for each line. This information is also punched in the paper. Before fitting the tape to the caster it is turned over so that the first holes read on each line set the width of the variable space. The subsequent holes determine the position of a frame, or die case, that holds the set of matrices for the face being used. Each matrix is a rectangle of copper recessed with the shape of the letter. Once the matrix is positioned over the mould that forms the rest of the piece of type being cast, molten type metal is injected.\n\nTo promote its image, the company ran a magazine, the ''Monotype Recorder'', over most of the twentieth century, and also ran a [[Compositor (typesetting)|compositor]] (typesetter operator) training school in London.<ref>{{cite web|title=Monotype Recorder back issues|url=http://www.metaltype.co.uk/monotype_recorder.shtml|website=Metal Type Library collection|accessdate=12 July 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"Duffy2017\" /> In 1936, the company was floated on the [[London Stock Exchange]] and became the Monotype Corporation Ltd.

The company was eventually split into three divisions: Monotype International, which manufactured spinning mirror switched laser beam phototypesetters; Monotype Limited, which continued the hot metal machines; and Monotype Typography, which designed and sold typefaces. A research and development department was set up in [[Cambridge]] to isolate it from day to day production issues.\n\nMonotype in the UK continued to enjoy prestige through the 1970s with the patronage of major British printers such as the university presses at Oxford and Cambridge; it also enjoyed some success with its Lasercomp laser-based typesetting system from the 1970s onwards, developed by the Cambridge research group.<ref name=MandP/><ref name=\"Louis2013\">{{cite book|first=Martin|last=Maw|title=History of Oxford University Press: Volume III: 1896 to 1970 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YbcJAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA277|date=November 2013|publisher=OUP Oxford |isbn=978-0-19-956840-6| pages=277\u2013307}}</ref> However, new technology and finally publishing software such as [[Quark XPress]] and [[Aldus PageMaker]] running on general-purpose computers ate away at its competitiveness in the market of complete typesetting solutions by the 1990s.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Romano|first1=Frank|title=The day the typesetting industry died |url=http://whattheythink.com/articles/55522-day-typesetting-industry-died/|website=What They Think|accessdate=22 July 2016}}</ref>\n\nMonotype, however, has continued in business, for instance marketing typeface designs to third-party buyers, computing companies such as Microsoft (many fonts on Microsoft computers in particular are Monotype-designed) and companies and organisations such as [[Transport for London|London Transport]] and the UK parliament requiring custom digital typefaces.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Castle |first1=Bob |last2=Carpenter |first2=Victoria|title=Book Antiqua Parliamentary (Freedom of Information request) |url=https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/book_antiqua_parliamentary_4| website=[[Whatdotheyknow.com]]|accessdate=27 March 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Walters|first1=John| last2=Esterson |first2=Simon|title=Features: Robin Nicholas| url=http://www.eyemagazine.com/feature/article/robin-nicholas|website=Eye magazine|accessdate=22 July 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Shaw|first1=Paul| first2=Matthew| last2=Carter| title=Some history about Arial|url=http://www.paulshawletterdesign.com/2011/09/blue-pencil-no-18%E2%80%94some-history-about-arial/| website=Paul Shaw Letter Design|accessdate=22 May 2015}}</ref> Much of its metal type equipment and archives were donated to the [[Type Museum]] collection in London; other materials are held at [[St Bride Library]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Mosley|first1=James |author-link=James Mosley |title=The materials of typefounding | url=http://typefoundry.blogspot.co.uk/2006/01/materials-of-typefounding.html |website=Type Foundry|accessdate=14 August 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Consolidation and reorganization===\nIn 1992 The Monotype Corporation Ltd. appointed [[Receivership|Administrative Receivers]] on 5 March and four days later Monotype Typography Ltd. was established. Cromas Holdings, an investment company based in Switzerland, bought the Monotype Corporation Ltd. and Monotype Inc. (excluding Monotype Typography) and five other direct subsidiary companies in France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, and Singapore. Monotype Systems Ltd. was the adopted name for the new organization with Peter Purdy as Chairman, the name Monotype was under license from Monotype Typography Ltd which retained the trademark Monotype. Monotype Systems Ltd. focused on selling [[pre-press]] software and hardware, [[raster image processor]]s and workflow.\n\nCromas Holdings reorganized its publishing interests with the formation of the International Publishing Asset Holding Ltd. effectively controlling Monotype Systems Ltd., QED Technology Ltd., and GB Techniques Ltd.\n\nThe company acquired Berthold Communications; the UK subsidiary of the German composing equipment supplier.\n\nIn June 2002, Monotype Systems Limited was re-branded, IPA Systems Limited, as this marked the end of the existing trademark licence with Monotype Corporation. In the US Monotype Inc became alfaQuest Technologies Limited. Both companies still sell pre-press software and hardware.\n\nIn 1999, [[Agfa]]-Compugraphic acquired the company, which was renamed Agfa Monotype. In late 2004, after six years under the Agfa Corporation, the Monotype assets were acquired by [[TA Associates]], a private equity investment firm based in [[Boston]]. The company was incorporated as Monotype Imaging, with a focus on the company's traditional core competencies of typography and professional printing.\n\nMonotype was the first company to produce a digital version of the handwritten [[Persian alphabet|Persian]] script, Persian [[Nasta'liq script|Nasta'liq]]. A Chinese \"keyboard\" was developed to typeset Chinese characters; it consisted of a book with a stylus. As the pages were turned, the page number was detected electrically and this was combined with the position of the character selected by the stylus on a large grid.\n\nIn 2003, the company launched Fontwise, the first software to audit desktops for licensed and unlicensed (not necessarily illegal) fonts.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20030930005093/en/Agfa-Monotype-Launches-Fontwise-Monotype-Worlds-Font | title=Agfa Monotype Launches Fontwise from Monotype, the World's First Font Licence Management Solution | publisher=[[Business Wire]] | date=September 30, 2003}}</ref>\n\nOn 2 October 2006, the company acquired Linotype GmbH, a subsidiary of [[Heidelberger Druckmaschinen]].<ref>{{cite press release | url=https://www.linotype.com/2794/monotype-imaging-acquires-linotype.html | title=MONOTYPE IMAGING ACQUIRES LINOTYPE | publisher=[[Linotype GmbH|Linotype]] | date=August 2006}}</ref>\n\nOn 18 September 2006, the company acquired China Type Design Limited, a typeface design and production company based in Hong Kong.
