The team was created by [[Dave Cockrum]], and [[first appeared]] in 1983 in the ninth of the [[Marvel Graphic Novels]] series, then in a three-issue run published by [[Deluxe Comics#Lodestone Comics|Lodestone Comics]].\n\nIn 2003, author [[Clifford Meth]] revamped the comic as a yet-to-be produced screenplay for [[IDT Entertainment]].\n\nA four-issue mini-series written and drawn by [[David Miller (comics)|David Miller]], with colors by Joe Rubenstein, focused on the character of Avatar and showed some of his history as he returned home to London and fought [[Morgan Le Fay]]. It was published in 2010 by David Miller Studios.\n\n==Publication history==\nThe characters first appeared in ''[[Marvel Graphic Novels]]'' #9 ({{ISBN|0939766817}}) and the story continued in a three-issue [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]] from [[Lodestone Comics]].\n\nThe series was reprinted by [[Eternity Comics]] in 1987.\n\nAn issue #0 (being material from the proposed fourth issue of the Lodestone series) was published in 1995 by Cockrum's own [[Aardwolf Publishing]], though only in black-and-white. In an inside-front cover essay that appeared in ''Futurians'' #0, Dave Cockrum's explained what happened:\n{{blockquote|''The Futurians'' began as a graphic novel for Marvel (''[[Marvel Graphic Novel]]'' #9), wherein I recounted the adventures of eight extraordinary humans with powers gained by way of genetic manipulation from the future. The graphic novel did pretty well, went into three printings, and a series was called for. Unfortunately, I let myself be lured away from Marvel and did the series for an independent publisher who promised pie-in-the-sky money. If I'd stayed with Marvel, we might be publishing ''Futurians'' #250 or something by now. Instead, I went with the independent, occasionally called Lodestone Publications, and my run only lasted three issues. A fourth issue was finished; this book you hold in your hands. Due to the vagaries of publishing, however, it never saw print as an individual issue until now. It was collected together with the previous three issues into a limited-edition second graphic novel in 1987. That second graphic novel was short-printed and is next-to-impossible to find. There has been renewed interest in ''The Futurians'' in recent months, and my friends at AARDWOLF and I decided to reprint the \"lost\" fourth issue, now numbered 0 for this edition, to test the waters for a possible new series. If you bought the three Lodestone issues but never saw the second graphic novel (and I know there are lots of you out there), here's your chance to finish the story.<ref>Cockrum, Dave. ''The Futurians'' #0, Aardwolf (Aug. 1995).</ref>}}\n\n==Plot==\nThe premise was of an extremely advanced future society called the Terminus, who attempted to alter the past by sending genetic information back through time, to give certain human beings super-powers (and a compulsion to use them) in order to enable them to stop some unnamed disaster. In the late 20th Century, a future inhabitant known only as \"Vandervecken\" or \"The Dutchman\" (both names for [[The Flying Dutchman]]) [[Mind transfer|downloaded his mind]] into the body of a hobo who later becomes the owner of the Future Dynamics corporation; Vandervecken then began gathering up those who had been empowered to begin preparing them for their historic battles.\n\n==Members==\n\nThe main characters of The Futurians:\n\n* '''Avatar''': The first empowered human, when we first meet him he is, unknown to Vandervecken, already functionally immortal and has an intuitive ability, which allows him to make accurate predictions based on seemingly insufficient data. Vandervecken's process gives him the additional powers of flight, superstrength, and invulnerability. He also has over three thousand years of knowledge and experience in strategy and tactics.  He is the only Futurian to have overcome his genetic conditioning to obey Vandervecken. He has had many names and identities throughout the centuries,the most recent being Andrew Pendragon.\n* '''Vandervecken''': The mind of a future time traveller in the body of vagabond who later becomes a millionaire scientific genius. He has vast knowledge of future events and technology.\n* '''Terrayne''': Geologist Harry Robbins has become a living mud-man who can manipulate rock and earth. At first he is permanently trapped in this form, but Vandervecken supplies him with a ring that allows him to become human again.\n* '''Silkie''': Marine biologist Tracy Winters becomes a green-skinned amphibian with the ability to breathe underwater at great depths, fire bio-electrical blasts, control and shape water, and transform into a humanoid [[manta ray]]-like form, which allows her to fly or swim at great speeds.\n* '''Werehawk''': Matthew Blackfeather, an attorney for the [[Sioux|Dakota]] Indian tribe, can turn into a clawed, flying hawk-like humanoid; however, when he does so, he can become overwhelmed by predatory instincts and a berserker rage. If he loses control entirely, he turns fully into a giant raptor bird.\n* '''Silver Shadow''': Ex-spy Jonathan Darknyte is able to become a living shadow, who can merge with, animate, or teleport through shadows and darkness.\n* '''Mosquito''': Dana Morgan gains the ability to fly and generate ultrasonic energy. She also carries a gun that fires anesthetic or explosive darts.\n* '''Sunswift''': A immortal fire elemental from Egypt, Neith can survive in space or in the [[Sun]]'s [[solar corona|corona]] where she currently resides, generate solar-temperature plasma, and fly at tremendous speeds. She is also the former lover of Andrew Pendragon from ancient times. Sunswift must shed a great deal of her power before she enters a planetary atmosphere for fear of accidentally destroying anything around her. But even after doing so, she is still a very formidable opponent.\n* '''Blackmane''': Walter Bonner becomes a lion-like being with razor-sharp talons and superhuman strength and agility.\n\n==Film adaptation==\n[[Clifford Meth]], who wrote one Futurians story with Cockrum, has worked on the screenplay for the story which was optioned by [[IDT Entertainment]] and, after the rights reverted, he was in negotiation with [[Richard Saperstein]], but that fell through as well.\n\nIn 2017, Deadpool co-creator Rob Liefeld optioned the property and announced that he planned to revive Cockrum's Futurians. \n<ref>https://www.newsarama.com/35034-liefeld-to-revive-cockrum-s-futurians.html</ref>\n<!-- \n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}} -->\n\n==References==\n\n<references />\n{{Refbegin}}\n*{{gcdb|type=character|search=Futurians|title=The Futurians}}\n*{{comicbookdb|type=team|id=933|title=The Futurians}}\n* [http://www.internationalhero.co.uk/f/futurian.htm The Futurians] at the International Catalogue of Superheroes\n{{Refend}}\n\n==External links==\n*  [http://mysterycomics-rdb.blogspot.com/2009/10/critique-109-les-justiciers-du-futur-de.html Review in French] {{in lang|fr}}\n\n[[Category:American comics titles]]\n[[Category:Comic book limited series]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics graphic novels]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics superhero teams]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Dave Cockrum]]\n", "text_old": "{{redirect|The Futurians|the real-world organization|Futurians|the sci-fi punk band|Futurians (band)}}\n{{Infobox comics team and title <!--Wikipedia:WikiProject Comics-->\n<!-- Group section -->\n|name                = The Futurians\n|image               = <!-- file name format only -->\n|imagesize           = <!-- default 250 -->\n|caption             = \n|group               = y\n|publisher           = [[Marvel Comics]]<br />[[Deluxe Comics#Lodestone Comics|Lodestone Comics]]<br />[[Aardwolf Publishing]]\n|debuthead           = \n|debut               = ''[[Marvel Graphic Novels]]'' #9\n|debutmo             = May\n|debutyr             = 1984\n|debuthead#          = \n|debut#              = \n|debutmo#            = \n|debutyr#            = \n|creators            = [[Dave Cockrum]]\n|type                = Team\n|business            = \n|organisation        = \n|organization        = y\n|team                = \n|base                = \n|owners              = Vandervecken\n|employees           = \n|members             = Avatar<br />Blackmane<br />Mosquito<br />Silkie<br />Silver Shadow<br />Sunswift<br />Terrayne<br />Werehawk\n|fullroster          =\n\n<!-- Series section -->\n|title               = Futurians\n|cvr_image           = <!-- filename format only -->\n|cvr_caption         = \n|schedule            = \n|format              = [[Graphic novel]]<br />[[Limited series (comics)|Limited series]]\n|limited             = \n|ongoing             = \n|1shot               = \n|SciFi               = first\n|Superhero           = y\n|multigenre          = y\n|pub_series          = \n|date                = \n|1stishhead          = Graphic novel\n|1stishyr            = 1984\n|1stishmo            = May\n|1stishhead1         = Limited series\n|1stishyr1           = 1985\n|1stishmo1           = October\n|endishyr1           = 1986\n|endishmo1           = April\n|issues              = 1<br />3 + #0\n|main_char_team      = \n|writers             = [[Dave Cockrum]]\n|artists             = '''Graphic novel'''<br />Dave Cockrum\n|pencillers          = '''Limited series'''<br />Dave Cockrum\n|inkers              = '''Limited series'''<br />[[Ricardo Villagran]]\n|letterers           = '''Graphic novel'''<br />[[Jim Novak]]<br />'''Limited series'''<br />[[John Workman]]\n|colorists           = [[Paty Cockrum]]\n|editors             = '''Graphic novel'''<br />[[Al Milgrom]]<br />[[Jim Shooter]]<br />'''Limited series'''<br />[[Brian Marshall (comics)|Brian Marshall]]<br />[[David Singer (comics)|David Singer]]\n|creative_team_month = \n|creative_team_year  = \n|creators_series     = \n|TPB                 = \n|ISBN                = \n|nonUS               =\n\n<!-- Category section -->\n|cat                 = teams\n|subcat              = Marvel Comics\n|altcat              = \n|hero                = y\n|villain             = \n|sortkey             = Futurians\n}}\n'''The Futurians''' was a fictional [[superhero]] team appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]].

Since the [[Type locality (biology)|type locality]] of ''B. variabilis'' is in [[L\u00fcbeck]] (Germany), the name is a synonym of ''B. viridis''.<ref name=ASW6/><ref name=Dufresnes2019a/> Earlier studies had been mislead by primarily looking at mitochondrial DNA, which can be unreliable in species where there has been historical hybridisation.<ref name=Dufresnes2019a/> Despite a relatively deep [[Genetic divergence|divergence]] between the species and their mostly [[allopatric]] or [[parapatric]] distributions (however, in Asia there are locations where as many three species occur together<ref name=Javari2009/>), hybridisation still occurs between some that come into contact today.<ref name=Dufresnes2019a/> For example, ''B. sitibundus'' and ''B. viridis'' have a broad hybrid zone in eastern Europe (mostly southern Balkan and European Russia) and western Anatolia, ''B. balearicus'' and ''B. viridis'' have a relatively narrow hybrid zone in the region of far northeastern Italy, and ''B. balearicus'' and ''B. boulengeri siculus'' only have very marginal hybridisation in eastern [[Sicily]].<ref name=Dufresnes2019a/><ref name=Colliard2010>{{cite journal | author1=Colliard, C. | author2=A.

For example, in 2006, based on similarities in [[mitochondrial DNA]], the population in northern Europe (northernmost Germany, Denmark and southern Sweden) was placed together with the populations from far southeastern Europe (southern [[Balkan]] and [[Cyprus]]) and parts of Asia ([[Anatolia]] and the [[Levant]] to Iran and central Asia) as the species ''B. variabilis''. In between these widely [[Disjunct distribution|disjunct]] populations of ''B. variabilis'' was ''B. viridis''.<ref name=Stock2006/> This was highly unusual from a [[zoogeographic]] point of view and in 2019 a more comprehensive study found that the north European population is part of ''B. viridis'', the population of southern Balkan and adjacent parts of Anatolia is a hybrid zone between ''B. viridis'' and  ''B. sitibundus'', the Cyprus population is its own species ''B. cypriensis'', and those of most of Anatolia and the Levant to Iran and central Asia are ''B. sitibundus''. Since the [[Type locality (biology)|type locality]] of ''B. variabilis'' is in [[L\u00fcbeck]] (Germany), the name is a synonym of ''B. viridis''.<ref name=ASW6/><ref name=Dufresnes2019a/> Earlier studies had been mislead by primarily looking at mitochondrial DNA, which can be unreliable in species where there has been historical hybridisation.<ref name=Dufresnes2019a/> Despite a relatively deep [[Genetic divergence|divergence]] between the species and their mostly [[allopatric]] or [[parapatric]] distributions (however, in Asia there are locations where as many three species occur together<ref name=Javari2009/>), hybridisation still occurs between some that come into contact today.<ref name=Dufresnes2019a/> For example, ''B. sitibundus'' and ''B. viridis'' have a broad hybrid zone in eastern Europe (mostly southern Balkan and European Russia) and western Anatolia, ''B. balearicus'' and ''B. viridis'' have a relatively narrow hybrid zone in the region of far northeastern Italy, and ''B. balearicus'' and ''B. boulengeri siculus'' only have very marginal hybridisation in eastern [[Sicily]].<ref name=Dufresnes2019a/><ref name=Colliard2010>{{cite journal | author1=Colliard, C. | author2=A.

At age 9 his musical talents were showcased in an interview on the TVOntario children's programme ''[[Cucumber (Canadian TV series)|Cucumber]]''. When he was 15,<ref>{{cite book|author=Assayas, Michka (ed.)|title = Le dictionnaire du rock|year= 2000|publisher= Robert laffont, collection Bouquins|page=775}}</ref> Jeff Healey formed the band Blue Direction, a four-piece that primarily played bar-band cover tunes and featured bassist Jeremy Littler, drummer Graydon Chapman, and a schoolmate, Rob Quail on second guitar. This band played various local clubs in Toronto, including the [[Colonial Tavern]].\n\nHealey began hosting a jazz and blues show on radio station [[CIUT-FM]] where he became known for playing from his massive collection of vintage 78 rpm [[phonograph|gramophone]] records.<ref>{{cite news | url= http://www.cbc.ca/radio2/blog/2008/03/03/jeff_healey_1.html | title=Jeff Healey | website=Cbc.ca | accessdate=May 23, 2011}}</ref>\n\nShortly thereafter he was introduced to two musicians, bassist Joe Rockman and drummer Tom Stephen, with whom he formed a trio, The Jeff Healey Band. This band made their first public appearance at the Birds Nest, located upstairs at Chicago's Diner on [[Queen Street West]] in Toronto. They received a write-up in Toronto's ''[[Now (newspaper)|NOW]]'' magazine, and soon were playing almost nightly in local clubs, such as Grossman's Tavern and the famed blues club Albert's Hall (where Jeff Healey was discovered by guitarists [[Stevie Ray Vaughan]] and [[Albert Collins]]).\n\nAfter being signed to [[Arista Records]] in 1988, the band released the album ''[[See the Light (Jeff Healey album)|See the Light]]'', which appeared on the RPM Top 100 chart in 1989.<ref>[http://www.bac-lac.gc.ca/eng/discover/films-videos-sound-recordings/rpm/Pages/item.aspx?IdNumber=4952& \"RPM Top 100 Albums\"].

While the band was recording ''See the Light'', they were also filming (and recording for the soundtrack of) the [[Patrick Swayze]] film [[Road House (1989 film)|''Road House'']]. Healey had numerous acting scenes in the movie with Swayze, as his band was the house cover band for the bar featured in the movie. In 1990, the band won the [[Juno Award]] for [[Juno Award for Entertainer of the Year|Canadian Entertainer of the Year]]. The albums ''[[Hell to Pay (Jeff Healey album)|Hell to Pay]]'' and ''[[Feel This (album)|Feel This]]'' gave Healey 10 charting singles in Canada between 1990 and 1994, including a [[cover version|cover]] of [[The Beatles]]' \"[[While My Guitar Gently Weeps]]\" which featured [[George Harrison]] and [[Jeff Lynne]] on backing vocals and acoustic guitar.<ref>Arista Records LP AL-8632, 1990.</ref>\n\n==Later work and life==\n[[File:JeffHealeyAug312002.jpg|thumb|left|Healey performing on August 31, 2002]]\nBy the release of the 2000 album ''[[Get Me Some (album)|Get Me Some]],'' Healey began to concentrate his talent in a different musical direction closer to his heart, the appreciation for another original American music form, [[jazz]].\n\nHe went on to release three CDs of music of traditional American jazz from the 1920s and 1930s. He had been sitting in with these types of bands around Toronto since the beginning of his music career. Though known primarily as a guitarist, Healey also played trumpet during live performances.  His main jazz group for touring and recording being Jeff Healey's Jazz Wizards.\n\nHealey was an avid [[record collecting|record collector]] and amassed a collection of well over 30,000 [[78 rpm]] records. Starting in 1990 he hosted a radio program of very early jazz on CIUT at the University of Toronto with Colin Bray. Later he went national on CBC Radio's program entitled ''My Kind of Jazz'', in which he played records from his vast vintage jazz collection. He moved the show two years later to Jazz FM - CJRT; as a part of ongoing celebrations for what would have been Healey's 50th birthday in 2016, the latter program began to air in repeats Wednesdays 9pm on jazz.fm.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://jeffhealey.com/2016/01/the-50th-celebrations-start-now|title=The 50th Celebrations Start Now!|first=|last=Rog|date=January 20, 2016|website=Jeffhealey.com|accessdate=March 10, 2019}}</ref>\n \nFor many years, Healey toured throughout North America and Europe and performed at his club, \"Healey's\" on [[Bathurst Street, Toronto|Bathurst Street]] in Toronto, where he played with his blues band on Thursday nights and also with his jazz group on Saturday afternoons. The club moved to a bigger location at 56 Blue Jays Way and was rechristened \"Jeff Healey's Roadhouse.\" Though he had lent his name to the club and often played there, Jeff Healey did not own or manage the bar. (The name came from the 1989 film, ''[[Road House (1989 film)|Road House]],'' in which Healey appeared.)\nAt the time of his death, he had been planning to perform a series of shows in the United Kingdom, Germany, and the [[Netherlands]] with his other band, the \"[[Jeff Healey Blues Band]]\" (aka the \"Healey's House Band\") in April 2008.\n\nOver the years, Healey toured and sat in with many well-known performers, including [[The Allman Brothers]], [[Bonnie Raitt]], [[Stevie Ray Vaughan]], [[Buddy Guy]], [[BB King]], [[ZZ Top]], [[Steve Lukather]], [[Eric Clapton]] and many more. In 2006, Healey appeared on [[Deep Purple]] vocalist [[Ian Gillan]]'s CD/DVD ''[[Gillan's Inn (album)|Gillan's Inn]].''\n\nHealey discovered and helped develop the careers of other musical artists, including [[Terra Hazelton]] and [[Amanda Marshall]].<ref>[http://pages.infinit.net/sonicboy/amanda/ The Ultimate Amanda Marshall Homepage].

He and his sister Kate, a thrice divorced banker with a yen for classical music and cats, are bonded by a secret, yet vast sense of inadequacy. Kate announces to David that she has decided to adopt an orphan in Brazil and asks him to be a father figure.

He was the youngest of the five [[Marx Brothers]] and also the last to die.  He appeared in the first five Marx Brothers feature films, from 1929 to 1933, but then left the act to start his second career as an engineer and theatrical agent.\n\n==Early life==\nZeppo was born in [[Manhattan, New York City]], on February 25, 1901. His parents were [[Sam Marx]] (called \"Frenchie\" throughout his life), and his wife, [[Minnie Marx|Minnie Sch\u00f6nberg Marx]]. Minnie's brother was [[Al Shean]], who later gained fame as half of the vaudeville team [[Gallagher and Shean]]. Marx's family was Jewish. His mother was from [[East Frisia]] in [[Germany]]; and his father was a native of [[France]], and worked as a tailor.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://judaisme.sdv.fr/perso/marxbr/geneal.htm|title=La famille paternelle des Marx Brothers|website=Judaisme.sdv.fr|accessdate=21 September 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|title=Mrs. Minnie Marx.

Zeppo's ex-wife [[Barbara Sinatra]] repeated this in her 2011 book, ''Lady Blue Eyes: My Life with Frank''. His brother [[Harpo Marx|Harpo]] offered a different account in his 1961 autobiography, ''Harpo Speaks!,'' claiming (p.&nbsp;130) that there was a popular trained chimpanzee named Mr. Zippo, and that \"Herbie\" was tagged with the name \"Zippo\" because he liked to do chinups and acrobatics, as the chimp did in its act. The youngest brother objected to this nickname, and it was altered to \"Zeppo\". Another version of this story was that his name\nwas changed to \"Zeppo\" in honor of the then popular \"Zepplin\". In a much later TV interview, Zeppo said that Zep is Italian-American slang for baby and as Zeppo was the youngest or baby Marx Brother, he was called Zeppo (BBC Archives).\n\n==Career==\nZeppo replaced brother Gummo in the Marx Brothers' stage act when the latter joined the army in 1918. Zeppo remained with the team and appeared in their successes in [[vaudeville]], on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]], and the first five Marx Brothers films, as a [[straight man]] and romantic lead, before leaving the team. According to a 1925 newspaper article, he also made a solo appearance in the [[Adolphe Menjou]] comedy ''[[A Kiss in the Dark (1925 film)|A Kiss in the Dark]]''. According to newspaper reviews, he appeared in a minor role.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.marx-brothers.org/marxology/kiss.htm|title=Marxology - A Kiss In The Dark - The Marx Brothers|website=Marx-brothers.org|accessdate=21 September 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn ''Lady Blue Eyes'', Barbara Sinatra, Zeppo's second wife, reported that Zeppo was considered too young to perform with his brothers, and when [[Gummo Marx|Gummo]] joined the Army, Zeppo was asked to join the act as a last-minute stand-in at a show in Texas. Zeppo was supposed to go out that night with a Jewish friend of his. They were supposed to take out two Irish girls, but Zeppo had to cancel to board the train to Texas. His friend went ahead and went on the date, and was shot a few hours later when he was attacked by an Irish gang that disapproved of a Jew dating an Irish girl.\n\nAs the youngest and having grown up watching his brothers, Zeppo could fill in for and imitate any of the others when illness kept them from performing. Groucho suffered from appendicitis during the Broadway run of ''[[Animal Crackers (theatre)|Animal Crackers]]'' and Zeppo filled in for him as Captain Spaulding.\n\n[[File:Time Magazine Cover Marx Brothers.jpg|left|thumb|Zeppo Marx (far right) with his brothers on the cover of [[Time (magazine)|TIME]] in 1932]]\n\"He was so good as Captain Spaulding  in ''Animal Crackers'' that I would have let him play the part indefinitely, if they had allowed me to smoke in the audience\", Groucho recalled.<ref>Marx, Arthur. ''My Life with Groucho: Growing Up with the Marx Brothers''. Barricade Books (June 1992)</ref> However, a comic persona of his own that could stand up against those of his brothers did not emerge. As critic Percy Hammond wrote, sympathetically, in 1928:\n\n<blockquote>One of the handicaps to the thorough enjoyment of the Marx Brothers in their merry escapades is the plight of poor Zeppo Marx. While Groucho, Harpo, and Chico are hogging the show, as the phrase has it, their brother hides in an insignificant role, peeping out now and then to listen to plaudits in which he has no share.<ref>''[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1144&dat=19281118&id=5W8bAAAAIBAJ&sjid=80oEAAAAIBAJ&pg=1522,4029042&hl=fr The Theater : Poor Zeppo Marx !]'', ''The Pittsburgh Press'', November 18, 1928.</ref></blockquote>\n\nThough Zeppo continued to play it straight in the Brothers' movies for [[Paramount Pictures]], he occasionally got to be part of classic comedy moments in them\u2014in particular, his role in the famous dictation scene with Groucho in ''[[Animal Crackers (1930 film)|Animal Crackers]]'' (1930). He also played a pivotal role as the love interest of [[Ruth Hall (actress)|Ruth Hall]]'s character in [[Monkey Business (1931 film)|''Monkey Business'']] (1931) and of [[Thelma Todd]]'s in ''[[Horse Feathers]]'' (1932).\n\nThe popular assumption that Zeppo's character was superfluous was fueled in part by Groucho. According to Groucho's own story, when the group became the Three Marx Brothers, the studio wanted to trim their collective salary, and Groucho replied, \"We're twice as funny without Zeppo!\"<ref name=\"britannica\">[http://blogs.britannica.com/blog/main/2006/11/on-the-silver-and-plasma-screen-duck-soup/ ''Duck Soup''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090105232835/http://blogs.britannica.com/blog/main/2006/11/on-the-silver-and-plasma-screen-duck-soup/ |date=January 5, 2009}} \u2013 ''[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]''. Groucho later said of his brother: \"Except for the chorus girls, being a straight man in the Marx Brothers wasn't fun for him. He wanted to be a comedian, too, but there just wasn't room for another funny Marx Brother. ... But offstage, he was the funniest one of us\".</ref>\n\nZeppo had great mechanical skills and was largely responsible for keeping the Marx family car running. He later owned a company that machined parts for the war effort during [[World War II]], Marman Products Co. of Inglewood, California, later acquired by the Aeroquip Company.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Donnelly|first=Jim|date=August 2009|title=Why a Clamp?|url=https://www.hemmings.com/stories/article/why-a-clamp|journal=Hemmings Classic Car|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref><ref>Aeroquip Corporation.\" ''International Directory of Company Histories'', edited by Tina Grant, vol. 16, St. James Press, 1997, pp. 7-9.</ref> This company produced a motorcycle, called the [[Marman Twin]],<ref name=\"Marman Twin\">[http://www.50sville.com/marman.html Marman Twin \u2013 Herbert Zeppo Marx \u2013 Marx Brothers<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140717185038/http://www.50sville.com/marman.html |date=July 17, 2014}}</ref> and the [[Marman clamp]]s used to hold the \"[[Fat Man]]\" [[atomic bomb]] inside the [[B-29 bomber]] ''[[Bockscar]]''.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} He invented and obtained several patents for a wristwatch that monitored the pulse rate of cardiac patients and gave off an alarm if the heartbeat became irregular,<ref>US Patent and Trademark Office; US Pat. 3,473,526; \"Cardiac Pulse-Rate Monitor\", filed July 14, 1967 & issued October 21, 1969; 3,426,747, \"Method and Watch Mechanism for Actuation by a Cardiac Pulse\", a continuation-in-part filed November 20, 1967, issued February 11, 1969.</ref> and a therapeutic pad for delivering moist heat to a patient.<ref>US PTO; U.S. Pat. 2,590,026; inventor Zeppo Marx; \"Vapor Delivery Pad for Distributing Moist Heat\", filed June 14, 1950, issued March 18, 1952.</ref>\n\nHe also founded a large theatrical agency with his brother Gummo.

On September 18, 1959, Marx married [[Barbara Blakeley]], whose son, Bobby Oliver, he wanted to adopt and give his surname, but Bobby's father would not allow it. Bobby simply started using the last name \"Marx\".\n\nBlakeley wrote in her book, ''Lady Blue Eyes'', that Zeppo never made her convert to Judaism. Blakeley was of Methodist faith and said that Zeppo told her she became Jewish by \"injection\".\n\nBlakeley also wrote in her book that Zeppo wanted to keep her son out of the picture, adding a room for him onto his estate, which was more of a guest house, as it was separated from the main residence. It was also decided that Blakeley's son would go to military school, which according to Blakeley, pleased Zeppo.\n\nZeppo owned a house on Halper Lake Drive in [[Rancho Mirage, California]], which was built off the fairway of the Tamarisk Country Club. The Tamarisk Club had been set up by the Jewish community, which rivaled the gentile club called The Thunderbird. His neighbor happened to be [[Frank Sinatra]]. Zeppo later attended the Hillcrest Country Club with friends such as Sinatra, [[George Burns]], [[Jack Benny]], [[Danny Kaye]], [[Sid Caesar]], and [[Milton Berle]].\n\nBlakeley became involved with the [[Cedars-Sinai Medical Center]], and had arranged to show ''[[Spartacus]]'' (featuring [[Kirk Douglas]]) for charity, selling tickets, and organizing a postscreening ball. At the last minute, Blakeley was told she could not have the film, so Zeppo went to the country club and spoke to Sinatra, who agreed to let him have an early release of a film he had just finished named ''[[Come Blow Your Horn (film)|Come Blow Your Horn]]''. Sinatra also flew everyone involved to Palm Springs for the event.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}\n\nZeppo was a very jealous and possessive husband, and hated for Blakeley to talk to other men. Blakeley claimed that Zeppo grabbed [[Victor Rothschild]] by the throat at a country club because she was talking to him. Blakeley had caught Zeppo on many occasions with other women; the biggest incident was a party Zeppo had thrown on his yacht. After the incident, Zeppo took Blakeley to Europe, and accepted more invitations to parties when they arrived back in the States. Some of these parties were at Sinatra's compound; he often invited Blakeley and Zeppo to his house two or three times a week. Sinatra would also send champagne or wine to their home, as a nice gesture.\n\nBlakeley and Sinatra began a love affair, unbeknownst to Zeppo. The press eventually got wind of the affair, snapping photos of Blakely and Sinatra together, or asking Blakeley questions whenever they spotted her. Both  Sinatra and she denied the affair.\n\nZeppo and Blakeley divorced in 1973. Zeppo let Blakeley keep the 1969 Jaguar he had bought her, and agreed to pay her $1,500 ({{Inflation|US|1500|1973|r=-2|fmt=eq}}) per month for 10 years. Sinatra upgraded Blakeley's Jaguar to the latest model. Sinatra also gave her a house to live in.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} The house had belonged to [[Eden Hartford]], Groucho Marx's third wife. Blakeley and Sinatra continued to date, and were constantly hounded by the press until the divorce between Zeppo and Blakeley became final. Blakeley and Sinatra were married in 1976.\n\nZeppo became ill with cancer in 1978. He sold his home, and moved to a house on the fairway off Frank Sinatra Drive. The doctors thought the cancer had gone into remission, but it returned. Zeppo called Blakeley, who accompanied him to doctor's appointments. Zeppo spent his last days with Blakeley's family.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}\n\n==Death==\nThe last surviving Marx Brother, Zeppo died of [[lung cancer]] at the [[Eisenhower Medical Center]] in Rancho Mirage on November 30, 1979, at the age of 78. He was cremated and his ashes were scattered into the [[Pacific Ocean]].<ref name=obit>{{cite news|title=Zeppo Marx Dies on Coast at 78; Last Survivor of Comedy Team; 'Tired of Being a Stooge'|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1979/12/01/archives/zeppo-marx-dies-on-coast-at-78-last-survivor-of-comedy-team-tired.html |page=47|quote=Zeppo Marx, the surviving member of the Marx Brothers comedy team who left the quartet in 1934 for other businesses, died yesterday at Eisenhower Medical Center in Palm Springs, Calif.

Both Sinatra and Blakeley attended his funeral.\n\n==Legacy==\nZeppo introduced [[Jack Benny]] to his wife [[Mary Livingstone]].{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n\nSeveral critics have challenged the notion that Zeppo did not develop a comic persona in his films. [[James Agee]] considered Zeppo \"a peerlessly cheesy improvement on the traditional straight man\".<ref>Joe Adamson. ''Groucho, Harpo, Chico and Sometimes Zeppo: A Celebration of the Marx Brothers''. New York: Simon and Schuster, 1973.</ref> Along similar lines, [[Gerald Mast]], in his book ''The Comic Mind: Comedy and Movies'', noted that Zeppo's comedic persona, while certainly more subtle than his brothers', was undeniably present:\n\n<blockquote>[He] added a fourth dimension as the clich\u00e9 of the [romantic] juvenile, the bland wooden espouser of sentiments that seem to exist only in the world of the sound stage. ... [He is] too schleppy, too nasal, and too wooden to be taken seriously.<ref>Mast, Gerald. ''The Comic Mind: Comedy and Movies'', pp. 282, 285. University of Chicago Press, 1979.</ref></blockquote>\n\nWhile this interpretation of Zeppo's comedic contributions could seemingly be considered a contemporary reappraisal of his role in the Paramount pictures, more astute film reviewers were apparently in on the joke as far back as the release of ''The Cocoanuts'' in 1929. ''[[The New York Times]]'' review of the movie, for example, ranked all four Marx Brothers equally \u2014 \"When the ''four'' Marx brothers are on the screen, it's a riot\" [emphasis added] \u2014 and went on to describe each of the brothers' unique style of comedy, and praised Zeppo as \"the handsome but dogged straight man with the charisma of an enamel washstand.\"<ref>''Cinema Year by Year, 1894\u20132001''. London: Dorling Kindersley Limited, 2001, p. 205.</ref>\n\nIn her book ''Hello, I Must be Going: Groucho & His Friends'', [[Charlotte Chandler]] defended Zeppo as being \"the Marx Brothers' interpreter in the worlds they invaded. He was neither totally a straight man nor totally a comedian, but combined elements of both, as did [[Margaret Dumont]]. Zeppo's importance to the Marx Brothers' initial success was as a Marx Brother who could 'pass' as a normal person. None of Zeppo's replacements ([[Allan Jones (actor)|Allan Jones]], [[Kenny Baker (American singer and actor)|Kenny Baker]] and others) could assume this character as convincingly as Zeppo, because they were actors, and Zeppo was the real thing, cast to type\" (562).\n\nZeppo's comic persona was further highlighted in the \"dictation scene\" of ''[[Animal Crackers (1930 film)|Animal Crackers]]''. In his book ''Groucho, Harpo, Chico, and Sometimes Zeppo'', [[Joe Adamson]] analyzed the scene, showing how it revealed Zeppo's ability to one-up Groucho with simple, plain-English rebuttals. In the scene, Groucho dictates a letter to his lawyer, which Zeppo takes down. Adamson noted,\n\n<blockquote>There is a common assumption that Zeppo = Zero, which this scene does its best to contradict. Groucho dictating a letter to anybody else would hardly be cause for rejoicing. We have to believe that someone will be there to accept all his absurdities and even respond somewhat in kind before things can progress free from conflict into this genial mishmash. Groucho clears his throat in the midst of his dictation, and Zeppo asks him if he wants that in the letter. Groucho says, 'No, put it in the envelope.' Zeppo nods. And only Zeppo could even try such a thing as taking down the heading and the salutation and leaving out the letter because it didn't sound important to him. It takes a Marx Brother to pull something like that on a Marx Brother and get away with it.<ref name=\"Adamson\">Joe Adamson, ''Groucho, Harpo, Chico and Sometimes Zeppo: A History of the Marx Brothers and a Satire on the Rest of the World'', Simon & Schuster, Paperback (1983).</ref>{{rp|114}}</blockquote>\n\nIn the same book, Adamson noted Zeppo's position as the campy parody of the juvenile romantic in his analysis of ''[[Horse Feathers]]''. This tongue-in-cheek observation bolstered the theory of Zeppo's stiffness as a deliberate comic persona:\n\n<blockquote>Each Marx Brother has his own form of comedy. Zeppo is at his funniest when he opens his mouth and sings. It has taken forty years, of course, for the full humor to come across. For a normal comedian this may be bad timing, but for a Marx Brother it's immortality. Almost every crooner of 1932 looks stilted and awkward now, but with Zeppo, who was never very convincing in the first place, the effect crosses the threshold into lovable comedy. \"I think you're wonderful!\" he oozes charmingly to [[Thelma Todd]], and we ''know'' he never met her before shooting started.<ref name=\"Adamson\"/>{{rp|191}}</blockquote>\n\nCritic Dan\u00e9l Griffin, who praises Zeppo as \"that great comic parody of the schleppy juvenile role of the 1920s/30s musicals,\u201d believes that the onscreen dynamic between Groucho and Zeppo is one of the \u201ckey relationships between the individual Marx Brothers [that] shape their comedic strategy, not counting when the four of them are onstage together.\u201d Griffin points out that Zeppo is often the brother who puts ideas into Groucho's head that set up storylines and big laughs; he goes on to explain,\n\n<blockquote>Zeppo\u2019s onscreen relationship with Groucho has always been tricky to ascertain; Zeppo is generally Groucho\u2019s aloof secretary in their films, but he is seemingly capable of reducing Groucho to stunned silence with simple, plain-English rebuttals (see ''[[Animal Crackers (1930 film)|Animal Crackers]]'') when Chico\u2019s snappy comebacks only fuel Groucho\u2019s insults all the more. \u2026  Zeppo\u2019s parts are usually small, but he performs exactly what is required of him as an outwardly wooden fellow who is incapable of being rattled by a man whose business is to rattle.<ref>{{cite web  | last = Griffin  | first = Dan\u00e9l  | title = ''Duck Soup'' review  | work = \"Film as Art\"  | publisher = [[University of Alaska Southeast]]  | url = http://uashome.alaska.edu/~dfgriffin/website/ducksoup.htm  | archive-url = https://archive.is/20121203234711/http://uashome.alaska.edu/~dfgriffin/website/ducksoup.htm  | url-status = dead  | archive-date = 2012-12-03  | accessdate = 2019-06-08  }}</ref></blockquote>\n\nAllen W. Ellis wrote in his article \"Yes, Sir: The Legacy of Zeppo Marx\":\n\n<blockquote>Indeed, Zeppo is a link between the audience and Groucho, Harpo and Chico. In a sense, he ''is'' us on the screen. He knows who those guys are and what they are capable of. As he ambles out of a scene, perhaps it is to watch them do their business, to come back in as necessary to move the film along, and again to join in the celebration of the finish. Further, Zeppo is crucial to the absurdity of the Paramount films. The humor is in his incongruity. Typically he dresses like a normal person, in stark contrast to Groucho's greasepaint and 'formal' attire, Harpo's rags, and Chico's immigrant hand-me-downs. By most accounts, he is the handsomest of the brothers, yet that handsomeness is distorted by his familial resemblance to the others\u2014sure, he's handsome, but it is a decidedly peculiar, Marxian handsomeness. By making the group four, Zeppo adds [[symmetry]], and in the [[surrealism|surrealistic]] worlds of the Paramount films, this symmetry upsets rather than confirms balance: it is [[wikt:chaos|chaos]] born of symmetry. That he is a plank in a maelstrom, along with the very concept of 'this guy' who is there for no real reason, who joins in and is accepted by these other three wildmen while the [[narrative]] offers no explanation, are wonderful in their pure absurdity. 'To string things together in a seemingly purposeless way,' said [[Mark Twain]], 'and to be seemingly unaware that they are absurd, is the mark of American humor.'

At least not directly. He just took it from Groucho, in more ways than one. ...

Grant, a teenager performing in vaudeville under his real name, Archie Leach, loved the Marx Brothers. And as Eliot put it,\n\n<blockquote>While the rest of the country preferred Groucho, Zeppo, the good-looking straight man and romantic lead, was Archie's favorite, the one whose foil timing he believed was the real key to the act's success. Not long after, Archie began to augment his already well-practiced \u201csuave\u201d Fairbanks look and dress with a Zeppo-like fancy [[bowtie]] (called a jazz-bow, or jazzbo, during the Roaring Twenties) and copied his brilliantine hairstyle, adding Dixie Peach, a favorite pomade of American black performers and show business leads, by the palmful to his thick dark mop, to give it a molded, comb-streaked blue-black Zeppo sheen. <ref>Eliot, Marc.

The object of the Marxes' comedy is anarchy, but its subject is fraternity: they are in it together to the end.

The award was also on behalf of Harpo, Chico, and Zeppo, whom Lemmon mentioned by name. It was one of Groucho's final major public appearances.  \"I wish that Harpo and Chico could be here to share with me this great honor,\" he said, naming the two deceased brothers (Zeppo was still alive at the time).

He was the youngest of the five [[Marx Brothers]] and also the last to die.  He appeared in the first five Marx Brothers feature films, from 1929 to 1933, but then left the act to start his second career as an engineer and theatrical agent.\n\n==Early life==\nZeppo was born in [[Manhattan, New York City]], on February 25, 1901. His parents were [[Sam Marx]] (called \"Frenchie\" throughout his life), and his wife, [[Minnie Marx|Minnie Sch\u00f6nberg Marx]]. Minnie's brother was [[Al Shean]], who later gained fame as half of the vaudeville team [[Gallagher and Shean]]. Marx's family was Jewish. His mother was from [[East Frisia]] in [[Germany]]; and his father was a native of [[France]], and worked as a tailor.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://judaisme.sdv.fr/perso/marxbr/geneal.htm|title=La famille paternelle des Marx Brothers|website=Judaisme.sdv.fr|accessdate=21 September 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|title=Mrs. Minnie Marx.

Zeppo's ex-wife [[Barbara Sinatra]] repeated this in her 2011 book, ''Lady Blue Eyes: My Life with Frank''. His brother [[Harpo Marx|Harpo]] offered a different account in his 1961 autobiography, ''Harpo Speaks!,'' claiming (p.&nbsp;130) that there was a popular trained chimpanzee named Mr. Zippo, and that \"Herbie\" was tagged with the name \"Zippo\" because he liked to do chinups and acrobatics, as the chimp did in its act. The youngest brother objected to this nickname, and it was altered to \"Zeppo\". Another version of this story was that his name\nwas changed to \"Zeppo\" in honor of the then popular \"Zepplin\". In a much later TV interview, Zeppo said that Zep is Italian-American slang for baby and as Zeppo was the youngest or baby Marx Brother, he was called Zeppo (BBC Archives).\n\n==Career==\nZeppo replaced brother Gummo in the Marx Brothers' stage act when the latter joined the army in 1918. Zeppo remained with the team and appeared in their successes in [[vaudeville]], on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]], and the first five Marx Brothers films, as a [[straight man]] and romantic lead, before leaving the team. According to a 1925 newspaper article, he also made a solo appearance in the [[Adolphe Menjou]] comedy ''[[A Kiss in the Dark (1925 film)|A Kiss in the Dark]]''. According to newspaper reviews, he appeared in a minor role.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.marx-brothers.org/marxology/kiss.htm|title=Marxology - A Kiss In The Dark - The Marx Brothers|website=Marx-brothers.org|accessdate=21 September 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn ''Lady Blue Eyes'', Barbara Sinatra, Zeppo's second wife, reported that Zeppo was considered too young to perform with his brothers, and when [[Gummo Marx|Gummo]] joined the Army, Zeppo was asked to join the act as a last-minute stand-in at a show in Texas. Zeppo was supposed to go out that night with a Jewish friend of his. They were supposed to take out two Irish girls, but Zeppo had to cancel to board the train to Texas. His friend went ahead and went on the date, and was shot a few hours later when he was attacked by an Irish gang that disapproved of a Jew dating an Irish girl.\n\nAs the youngest and having grown up watching his brothers, Zeppo could fill in for and imitate any of the others when illness kept them from performing. Groucho suffered from appendicitis during the Broadway run of ''[[Animal Crackers (theatre)|Animal Crackers]]'' and Zeppo filled in for him as Captain Spaulding.\n\n[[File:Time Magazine Cover Marx Brothers.jpg|left|thumb|Zeppo Marx (far right) with his brothers on the cover of [[Time (magazine)|TIME]] in 1932]]\n\"He was so good as Captain Spaulding  in ''Animal Crackers'' that I would have let him play the part indefinitely, if they had allowed me to smoke in the audience\", Groucho recalled.<ref>Marx, Arthur. ''My Life with Groucho: Growing Up with the Marx Brothers''. Barricade Books (June 1992)</ref> However, a comic persona of his own that could stand up against those of his brothers did not emerge. As critic Percy Hammond wrote, sympathetically, in 1928:\n\n<blockquote>One of the handicaps to the thorough enjoyment of the Marx Brothers in their merry escapades is the plight of poor Zeppo Marx. While Groucho, Harpo, and Chico are hogging the show, as the phrase has it, their brother hides in an insignificant role, peeping out now and then to listen to plaudits in which he has no share.<ref>''[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1144&dat=19281118&id=5W8bAAAAIBAJ&sjid=80oEAAAAIBAJ&pg=1522,4029042&hl=fr The Theater : Poor Zeppo Marx !]'', ''The Pittsburgh Press'', November 18, 1928.</ref></blockquote>\n\nThough Zeppo continued to play it straight in the Brothers' movies for [[Paramount Pictures]], he occasionally got to be part of classic comedy moments in them\u2014in particular, his role in the famous dictation scene with Groucho in ''[[Animal Crackers (1930 film)|Animal Crackers]]'' (1930). He also played a pivotal role as the love interest of [[Ruth Hall (actress)|Ruth Hall]]'s character in [[Monkey Business (1931 film)|''Monkey Business'']] (1931) and of [[Thelma Todd]]'s in ''[[Horse Feathers]]'' (1932).\n\nThe popular assumption that Zeppo's character was superfluous was fueled in part by Groucho. According to Groucho's own story, when the group became the Three Marx Brothers, the studio wanted to trim their collective salary, and Groucho replied, \"We're twice as funny without Zeppo!\"<ref name=\"britannica\">[http://blogs.britannica.com/blog/main/2006/11/on-the-silver-and-plasma-screen-duck-soup/ ''Duck Soup''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090105232835/http://blogs.britannica.com/blog/main/2006/11/on-the-silver-and-plasma-screen-duck-soup/ |date=January 5, 2009}} \u2013 ''[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]''. Groucho later said of his brother: \"Except for the chorus girls, being a straight man in the Marx Brothers wasn't fun for him. He wanted to be a comedian, too, but there just wasn't room for another funny Marx Brother. ... But offstage, he was the funniest one of us\".</ref>\n\nZeppo had great mechanical skills and was largely responsible for keeping the Marx family car running. He later owned a company that machined parts for the war effort during [[World War II]], Marman Products Co. of Inglewood, California, later known as the Aeroquip Company.

On September 18, 1959, Marx married [[Barbara Blakeley]], whose son, Bobby Oliver, he wanted to adopt and give his surname, but Bobby's father would not allow it. Bobby simply started using the last name \"Marx\".\n\nBlakeley wrote in her book, ''Lady Blue Eyes'', that Zeppo never made her convert to Judaism. Blakeley was of Methodist faith and said that Zeppo told her she became Jewish by \"injection\".\n\nBlakeley also wrote in her book that Zeppo wanted to keep her son out of the picture, adding a room for him onto his estate, which was more of a guest house, as it was separated from the main residence. It was also decided that Blakeley's son would go to military school, which according to Blakeley, pleased Zeppo.\n\nZeppo owned a house on Halper Lake Drive in [[Rancho Mirage, California]], which was built off the fairway of the Tamarisk Country Club. The Tamarisk Club had been set up by the Jewish community, which rivaled the gentile club called The Thunderbird. His neighbor happened to be [[Frank Sinatra]]. Zeppo later attended the Hillcrest Country Club with friends such as Sinatra, [[George Burns]], [[Jack Benny]], [[Danny Kaye]], [[Sid Caesar]], and [[Milton Berle]].\n\nBlakeley became involved with the [[Cedars-Sinai Medical Center]], and had arranged to show ''[[Spartacus]]'' (featuring [[Kirk Douglas]]) for charity, selling tickets, and organizing a postscreening ball. At the last minute, Blakeley was told she could not have the film, so Zeppo went to the country club and spoke to Sinatra, who agreed to let him have an early release of a film he had just finished named ''[[Come Blow Your Horn (film)|Come Blow Your Horn]]''. Sinatra also flew everyone involved to Palm Springs for the event.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}\n\nZeppo was a very jealous and possessive husband, and hated for Blakeley to talk to other men. Blakeley claimed that Zeppo grabbed [[Victor Rothschild]] by the throat at a country club because she was talking to him. Blakeley had caught Zeppo on many occasions with other women; the biggest incident was a party Zeppo had thrown on his yacht. After the incident, Zeppo took Blakeley to Europe, and accepted more invitations to parties when they arrived back in the States. Some of these parties were at Sinatra's compound; he often invited Blakeley and Zeppo to his house two or three times a week. Sinatra would also send champagne or wine to their home, as a nice gesture.\n\nBlakeley and Sinatra began a love affair, unbeknownst to Zeppo. The press eventually got wind of the affair, snapping photos of Blakely and Sinatra together, or asking Blakeley questions whenever they spotted her. Both  Sinatra and she denied the affair.\n\nZeppo and Blakeley divorced in 1973. Zeppo let Blakeley keep the 1969 Jaguar he had bought her, and agreed to pay her $1,500 ({{Inflation|US|1500|1973|r=-2|fmt=eq}}) per month for 10 years. Sinatra upgraded Blakeley's Jaguar to the latest model. Sinatra also gave her a house to live in.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} The house had belonged to [[Eden Hartford]], Groucho Marx's third wife. Blakeley and Sinatra continued to date, and were constantly hounded by the press until the divorce between Zeppo and Blakeley became final. Blakeley and Sinatra were married in 1976.\n\nZeppo became ill with cancer in 1978. He sold his home, and moved to a house on the fairway off Frank Sinatra Drive. The doctors thought the cancer had gone into remission, but it returned. Zeppo called Blakeley, who accompanied him to doctor's appointments. Zeppo spent his last days with Blakeley's family.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}\n\n==Death==\nThe last surviving Marx Brother, Zeppo died of [[lung cancer]] at the [[Eisenhower Medical Center]] in Rancho Mirage on November 30, 1979, at the age of 78.

[[James Agee]] considered Zeppo \"a peerlessly cheesy improvement on the traditional straight man\".<ref>Joe Adamson. ''Groucho, Harpo, Chico and Sometimes Zeppo: A Celebration of the Marx Brothers''. New York: Simon and Schuster, 1973.</ref> Along similar lines, [[Gerald Mast]], in his book ''The Comic Mind: Comedy and Movies'', noted that Zeppo's comedic persona, while certainly more subtle than his brothers', was undeniably present:\n\n<blockquote>[He] added a fourth dimension as the clich\u00e9 of the [romantic] juvenile, the bland wooden espouser of sentiments that seem to exist only in the world of the sound stage. ... [He is] too schleppy, too nasal, and too wooden to be taken seriously.<ref>Mast, Gerald. ''The Comic Mind: Comedy and Movies'', pp. 282, 285. University of Chicago Press, 1979.</ref></blockquote>\n\nWhile this interpretation of Zeppo's comedic contributions could seemingly be considered a contemporary reappraisal of his role in the Paramount pictures, more astute film reviewers were apparently in on the joke as far back as the release of ''The Cocoanuts'' in 1929. ''[[The New York Times]]'' review of the movie, for example, ranked all four Marx Brothers equally \u2014 \"When the ''four'' Marx brothers are on the screen, it's a riot\" [emphasis added] \u2014 and went on to describe each of the brothers' unique style of comedy, and praised Zeppo as \"the handsome but dogged straight man with the charisma of an enamel washstand.\"<ref>''Cinema Year by Year, 1894\u20132001''. London: Dorling Kindersley Limited, 2001, p. 205.</ref>\n\nIn her book ''Hello, I Must be Going: Groucho & His Friends'', [[Charlotte Chandler]] defended Zeppo as being \"the Marx Brothers' interpreter in the worlds they invaded. He was neither totally a straight man nor totally a comedian, but combined elements of both, as did [[Margaret Dumont]]. Zeppo's importance to the Marx Brothers' initial success was as a Marx Brother who could 'pass' as a normal person. None of Zeppo's replacements ([[Allan Jones (actor)|Allan Jones]], [[Kenny Baker (American singer and actor)|Kenny Baker]] and others) could assume this character as convincingly as Zeppo, because they were actors, and Zeppo was the real thing, cast to type\" (562).\n\nZeppo's comic persona was further highlighted in the \"dictation scene\" of ''[[Animal Crackers (1930 film)|Animal Crackers]]''. In his book ''Groucho, Harpo, Chico, and Sometimes Zeppo'', [[Joe Adamson]] analyzed the scene, showing how it revealed Zeppo's ability to one-up Groucho with simple, plain-English rebuttals. In the scene, Groucho dictates a letter to his lawyer, which Zeppo takes down. Adamson noted,\n\n<blockquote>There is a common assumption that Zeppo = Zero, which this scene does its best to contradict. Groucho dictating a letter to anybody else would hardly be cause for rejoicing. We have to believe that someone will be there to accept all his absurdities and even respond somewhat in kind before things can progress free from conflict into this genial mishmash. Groucho clears his throat in the midst of his dictation, and Zeppo asks him if he wants that in the letter. Groucho says, 'No, put it in the envelope.' Zeppo nods. And only Zeppo could even try such a thing as taking down the heading and the salutation and leaving out the letter because it didn't sound important to him. It takes a Marx Brother to pull something like that on a Marx Brother and get away with it.<ref name=\"Adamson\">Joe Adamson, ''Groucho, Harpo, Chico and Sometimes Zeppo: A History of the Marx Brothers and a Satire on the Rest of the World'', Simon & Schuster, Paperback (1983).</ref>{{rp|114}}</blockquote>\n\nIn the same book, Adamson noted Zeppo's position as the campy parody of the juvenile romantic in his analysis of ''[[Horse Feathers]]''. This tongue-in-cheek observation bolstered the theory of Zeppo's stiffness as a deliberate comic persona:\n\n<blockquote>Each Marx Brother has his own form of comedy. Zeppo is at his funniest when he opens his mouth and sings. It has taken forty years, of course, for the full humor to come across. For a normal comedian this may be bad timing, but for a Marx Brother it's immortality. Almost every crooner of 1932 looks stilted and awkward now, but with Zeppo, who was never very convincing in the first place, the effect crosses the threshold into lovable comedy. \"I think you're wonderful!\" he oozes charmingly to [[Thelma Todd]], and we ''know'' he never met her before shooting started.<ref name=\"Adamson\"/>{{rp|191}}</blockquote>\n\nCritic Dan\u00e9l Griffin, who praises Zeppo as \"that great comic parody of the schleppy juvenile role of the 1920s/30s musicals,\u201d believes that the onscreen dynamic between Groucho and Zeppo is one of the \u201ckey relationships between the individual Marx Brothers [that] shape their comedic strategy, not counting when the four of them are onstage together.\u201d Griffin points out that Zeppo is often the brother who puts ideas into Groucho's head that set up storylines and big laughs; he goes on to explain,\n\n<blockquote>Zeppo\u2019s onscreen relationship with Groucho has always been tricky to ascertain; Zeppo is generally Groucho\u2019s aloof secretary in their films, but he is seemingly capable of reducing Groucho to stunned silence with simple, plain-English rebuttals (see ''[[Animal Crackers (1930 film)|Animal Crackers]]'') when Chico\u2019s snappy comebacks only fuel Groucho\u2019s insults all the more. \u2026  Zeppo\u2019s parts are usually small, but he performs exactly what is required of him as an outwardly wooden fellow who is incapable of being rattled by a man whose business is to rattle.<ref>{{cite web  | last = Griffin  | first = Dan\u00e9l  | title = ''Duck Soup'' review  | work = \"Film as Art\"  | publisher = [[University of Alaska Southeast]]  | url = http://uashome.alaska.edu/~dfgriffin/website/ducksoup.htm  | archive-url = https://archive.is/20121203234711/http://uashome.alaska.edu/~dfgriffin/website/ducksoup.htm  | url-status = dead  | archive-date = 2012-12-03  | accessdate = 2019-06-08  }}</ref></blockquote>\n\nAllen W. Ellis wrote in his article \"Yes, Sir: The Legacy of Zeppo Marx\":\n\n<blockquote>Indeed, Zeppo is a link between the audience and Groucho, Harpo and Chico. In a sense, he ''is'' us on the screen. He knows who those guys are and what they are capable of. As he ambles out of a scene, perhaps it is to watch them do their business, to come back in as necessary to move the film along, and again to join in the celebration of the finish. Further, Zeppo is crucial to the absurdity of the Paramount films. The humor is in his incongruity. Typically he dresses like a normal person, in stark contrast to Groucho's greasepaint and 'formal' attire, Harpo's rags, and Chico's immigrant hand-me-downs. By most accounts, he is the handsomest of the brothers, yet that handsomeness is distorted by his familial resemblance to the others\u2014sure, he's handsome, but it is a decidedly peculiar, Marxian handsomeness. By making the group four, Zeppo adds [[symmetry]], and in the [[surrealism|surrealistic]] worlds of the Paramount films, this symmetry upsets rather than confirms balance: it is [[wikt:chaos|chaos]] born of symmetry. That he is a plank in a maelstrom, along with the very concept of 'this guy' who is there for no real reason, who joins in and is accepted by these other three wildmen while the [[narrative]] offers no explanation, are wonderful in their pure absurdity. 'To string things together in a seemingly purposeless way,' said [[Mark Twain]], 'and to be seemingly unaware that they are absurd, is the mark of American humor.' The 'sense' injected into the nonsense only compounds the nonsense.<ref>Ellis, Allen W. \"Yes, Sir: The Legacy of Zeppo Marx\" in ''The Journal of Popular Culture'', Vol. 37, No. 1, 2003, pp. 21-22.</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn a eulogy for Zeppo written in 1979 for ''[[The Washington Post]]'', columnist Tom Zito wrote:\n\n<blockquote>Thank goodness for Zeppo, who never really cracked a joke on screen. At least not directly. He just took it from Groucho, in more ways than one. ... If Groucho, Chico and Harpo were the funny guys, Zeppo was the [[Everyman]], the loser who'd come running out of the grocery store only to find the meter maid sticking the parking ticket on his Hungadunga.<ref>Tom Zito, \"The Last of the Marxes\", ''The Washington Post'': December 1, 1979.</ref></blockquote>\n\nZeppo's performances produced this tribute from a prominent fan, written in [[Marc Eliot (author)|Marc Eliot]]'s 2005 [[biography]] of [[Cary Grant]]. Grant, a teenager performing in vaudeville under his real name, Archie Leach, loved the Marx Brothers. And as Eliot put it,\n\n<blockquote>While the rest of the country preferred Groucho, Zeppo, the good-looking straight man and romantic lead, was Archie's favorite, the one whose foil timing he believed was the real key to the act's success. Not long after, Archie began to augment his already well-practiced \u201csuave\u201d Fairbanks look and dress with a Zeppo-like fancy [[bowtie]] (called a jazz-bow, or jazzbo, during the Roaring Twenties) and copied his brilliantine hairstyle, adding Dixie Peach, a favorite pomade of American black performers and show business leads, by the palmful to his thick dark mop, to give it a molded, comb-streaked blue-black Zeppo sheen. <ref>Eliot, Marc. ''Cary Grant: The Biography''. New York: Aurum Press (2005).</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn his book ''The Anarchy of the Imagination: Interviews, Essays, Notes'', noted filmmaker [[Rainer Werner Fassbinder]] included Zeppo on his list for the ten greatest film actors of all time.<ref>Fassbinder, R.

The object of the Marxes' comedy is anarchy, but its subject is fraternity: they are in it together to the end. Zeppo's inclusion in the family made the others less like clowns and more like brothers.<ref>[https://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/how-a-lost-marx-brothers-musical-found-its-way-back-onstage Gopnik, Adam.

The award was also on behalf of Harpo, Chico, and Zeppo, whom Lemmon mentioned by name. It was one of Groucho's final major public appearances.  \"I wish that Harpo and Chico could be here to share with me this great honor,\" he said, naming the two deceased brothers (Zeppo was still alive at the time). Groucho also praised the late [[Margaret Dumont]] as a great straight woman who never understood any of his jokes.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a1YsAxiiH98 |title=Groucho Marx receiving an Honorary Oscar\u00ae |website=Oscars.org |date=2009-11-24 |accessdate=2018-08-17}}</ref>\n\n==In popular culture==\nOn the television series ''[[Cheers]]'', [[Lilith Crane]] said Zeppo was her favorite Marx brother.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pEN6sTeG20AC&pg=PA270&lpg=PA270&dq=lilith+cheers+zeppo&source=bl&ots=G6PSkf0iU3&sig=4rMgxlZdJzEV0tGiZs5u3gQl2CE&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiqtdfC09fWAhUK3IMKHbLDAzcQ6AEIVTAI#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Cheers TV Show: A Comprehensive Reference|first=Dennis|last=Bjorklund|date=1 September 2014|publisher=Praetorian Publishing|accessdate=21 September 2018|via=Google Books}}</ref>\n\nA third season episode of the television series ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'' was titled \"[[The Zeppo]]\".

Now there are almost 160 other varieties in Australia's vineyards. \n\nSome are planted only in small quantities and are being used by winemakers for specialised products.<ref>For a detailed exploration of Australia's rare varieties, see Higgs, Darby. \"Alternative Wine Grape Varieties in Australia.\" Vinodiversity.[https://www.vinodiversity.com/varieties.html] Accessed 5 March 2020.</ref> Others are experiencing an ever-increasing demand either for use in the blending process or as wines carrying their names on the labels.

Mitchell Beazley, 1986. p. 50. {{ISBN|1-85732-999-6}}.</ref>\n\n===Implications of road transport===\nAlthough there are some winemakers who use only grapes grown in their own vineyards, not all winegrowers are winemakers, and the opposite is also true. This means some winegrowers sell part or all of their output to others, and for an industry spread across all six states on a large continent, road transport plays a major role in moving stock from one place to another.\n\nReports on the actual volume of grapes and wine being transported each year are hard to find. In trying to calculate this by comparing the volume of grapes grown per region with the volume of where they were processed by region, Chris Quirk wrote of bulk transportation:<blockquote>\"This is difficult to track but it could be in the order of half a million litres a week. It is therefore difficult to accurately compare the significance of one wine region over another. Modern technology has clouded the issue.\"<ref>Quirk, Chris. \"Growing Areas.\" The Great Australian Wine Book. Edited by Robert Mayne. Reed Books, 1983. p. 496. {{ISBN|0-7301-0101-0}}. Considering the age of this book and the fact that Australia's volume of output has greatly increased since then, it could be safely estimated that the volume transported by road would now be significantly more than half a million litres.</ref></blockquote>\n\nRobinson commented on this with some irony: <blockquote>\"The importance of trucking should not be underestimated. The typical large winery is probably based in South Australia, often in the Barossa, but will buy in grapes from as far afield as Coonawarra, the irrigated interior and possibly even the Hunter Valley in New South Wales. (Conversely, it has been a source of persistent irritation to South Australians that they have long provided so much fruit to bolster the reputations of wineries based in New South Wales.)\"<ref>Robinson, \"Australia.\" ''Wine regions.''[https://www.jancisrobinson.com/learn/wine-regions/australia] Accessed 7 March 2020.</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe problem in devising the Lists below from available sources was in determining whether wine regions showing in relation to each variety related to where it was grown or where it used in producing an end-product. As a result, the column headed \"Location - Growers and Makers\" contains both.\n\n==Government rules and regulations==\nThe wine industry operates under the ''Wine Australia Act 2013''<ref name=WineAct>''Wine Australia Act 2013.''

Now there are almost 160 other varieties in Australia's vineyards. \n\nSome are planted only in small quantities and are being used by winemakers for specialised products.<ref>For a detailed exploration of Australia's rare varieties, see Higgs, Darby. \"Alternative Wine Grape Varieties in Australia.\" Vinodiversity.[https://www.vinodiversity.com/varieties.html] Accessed 5 March 2020.</ref> Others are experiencing an ever-increasing demand either for use in the blending process or as wines carrying their names on the labels.

''Vines, Grapes & Wines: A wine drinker's guide to grape varieties.'' Mitchell Beazley, 1986. p. 50. {{ISBN|1-85732-999-6}}.</ref>\n\n===Implications of road transport===\nAlthough there are some winemakers who use only grapes grown in their own vineyards, not all winegrowers are winemakers, and the opposite is also true. This means some winegrowers sell part or all of their output to others, and for an industry spread across all six states on a large continent, road transport plays a major role in moving stock from one place to another.\n\nReports on the actual volume of grapes and wine being transported each year are hard to find. In trying to calculate this by comparing the volume of grapes grown per region with the volume of where they were processed by region, Chris Quirk wrote of bulk transportation:<blockquote>\"This is difficult to track but it could be in the order of half a million litres a week. It is therefore difficult to accurately compare the significance of one wine region over another. Modern technology has clouded the issue.\"<ref>Quirk, Chris. \"Growing Areas.\" The Great Australian Wine Book. Edited by Robert Mayne. Reed Books, 1983. p. 496. {{ISBN|0-7301-0101-0}}. Considering the age of this book and the fact that Australia's volume of output has greatly increased since then, it could be safely estimated that the volume transported by road would now be significantly more than half a million litres.</ref></blockquote>\n\nRobinson commented on this with some irony: <blockquote>\"The importance of trucking should not be underestimated. The typical large winery is probably based in South Australia, often in the Barossa, but will buy in grapes from as far afield as Coonawarra, the irrigated interior and possibly even the Hunter Valley in New South Wales. (Conversely, it has been a source of persistent irritation to South Australians that they have long provided so much fruit to bolster the reputations of wineries based in New South Wales.)\"<ref>Robinson, \"Australia.\" ''Wine regions.''[https://www.jancisrobinson.com/learn/wine-regions/australia] Accessed 7 March 2020.</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe problem in devising the Lists below from available sources was in determining whether wine regions showing in relation to each variety related to where it was grown or where it used in producing an end-product. As a result, the column headed \"Location - Growers and Makers\" contains both.\n\n==Government rules and regulations==\nThe wine industry operates under the ''Wine Australia Act 2013''<ref name=WineAct>''Wine Australia Act 2013.''

Coronal loops \u2014 linking areas of opposite magnetic polarity in the photosphere \u2014 enormous solar prominences and sunspots are all to be seen here.]]\n\n'''Coronal loops''' are huge loops of [[magnetic field]] beginning and ending on the [[Sun]]'s visible surface ([[photosphere]]) projecting into the solar atmosphere ([[solar corona|corona]]).  Hot glowing [[ionization|ionized]] gas ([[plasma (physics)|plasma]]) trapped in the loops makes them visible.  Coronal loops range widely in size up to several thousand kilometers long.  They are transient features of the solar surface, forming and dissipating over periods of seconds to days. They form the basic structure of the lower [[solar corona|corona]] and [[solar transition region|transition region]] of the Sun. These highly structured loops are a direct consequence of the twisted solar [[magnetic flux]] within the solar body.  Coronal loops are associated with [[sunspot]]s; the two \"footpoints\" where the loop passes through the sun's surface are often sunspots.  This is because sunspots occur at regions of high magnetic field.  The high magnetic field where the loop passes through the surface forms a barrier to [[convection]] currents, which bring hot [[plasma (physics)|plasma]] from the interior to the sun's surface, so the plasma in these high field regions is cooler than the rest of the sun's surface, appearing as a dark spot when viewed against the rest of the photosphere. The population of coronal loops varies with the 11 year [[solar cycle]], which also influences the number of sunspots.\n\n==Origin and physical features==\n[[Image:Twistedflux.png|thumb|A diagram showing the evolution of the solar magnetic flux over one solar cycle.]]\n[[Image:Cartoonloops.png|thumb|Diagram of the low [[solar corona|corona]] and [[solar transition region|transition region]], where many scales of coronal loops can be observed.]]\n\nDue to a natural process called the [[solar dynamo]] driven by heat produced in the Sun's core, [[convection|convective]] motion of the [[electrical conductivity|electrically conductive]] [[ionization|ionized]] gas ([[plasma (physics)|plasma]]) which makes up the Sun creates [[electric current]]s, which in turn create powerful [[magnetic field]]s in the Sun's interior.  These magnetic fields are in the form of closed loops of [[magnetic flux]], which are twisted and tangled by the different rotation rates of the gas at different latitudes of the solar sphere. A coronal loop occurs when a curved arc of the magnetic field projects through the visible surface of the Sun, the [[photosphere]], protruding into the solar atmosphere.\n\nWithin the magnetic field, the paths of the moving [[electric charge|electrically charged]] particles ([[electron]]s and [[ion]]s) which make up the Sun's gas are sharply bent by the field when moving transverse to the field, so they can only move freely parallel to the magnetic field lines, tending to spiral around the lines.  Thus the gas within a coronal loop cannot escape sideways out of the loop but is trapped in the loop and can only flow along its length.  The higher temperature in the Sun's atmosphere causes this gas to glow, making the loop visible through telescopes.  Coronal loops are ideal structures to observe when trying to understand the transfer of energy from the solar body, through the transition region and into the corona.\n\nThe strong interaction of the magnetic field with the dense plasma on and below the sun's surface tends to cause the magnetic field lines to be \"tied\" to the motion of the sun's gas, so the two 'footpoints' where the loop enters the photosphere are anchored to the sun's surface, and rotate with the surface.  Within each footpoint, the strong magnetic flux tends to inhibit the [[convection current]]s which carry hot gas from the sun's interior to the surface, so the footpoints are often (but not always) cooler than the surrounding photosphere.  These appear as dark spots on the sun's surface; [[sunspot]]s.  Thus sunspots tend to occur under coronal loops, and tend to come in pairs of opposite [[magnetic polarity]]; a point where the magnetic field loop emerges from the photosphere is a North [[magnet|magnetic pole]], and the other where the loop enters the surface again is a South magnetic pole.\n\nCoronal loops form in a wide range of sizes, from 10&nbsp;km to 10,000&nbsp;km.  A related phenomenon, open [[flux tube]]s of magnetic field extend from the surface far into the corona and heliosphere and are the source of the sun's large scale magnetic field ([[magnetosphere]]) and the [[solar wind]].   Coronal loops have a wide variety of temperatures along their lengths. Loops at temperatures below 1&nbsp;[[megakelvin]]&nbsp;(MK) are generally known as cool loops, those existing at around 1&nbsp;MK are known as warm loops, and those beyond 1&nbsp;MK are known as hot loops. Naturally, these different categories radiate at different wavelengths.<ref>{{cite journal\n  | last = Vourlidas\n  | first = A.\n  |author2=J. A. Klimchuk |author3=C. M. Korendyke |author4=T. D.

It is important to note that observations suggest the whole corona is massively populated by open and closed magnetic fieldlines.\n\n===Coronal loops and the coronal heating problem===\n[[Image:Energyfig.png|thumb|A modelled example of a quiescent coronal loop (energy contributions).]]\n\nA closed loop of magnetic field, a [[flux tube]] above the solar surface, does not by itself constitute a coronal loop; it must be ''filled with plasma'' before it can be called a coronal loop. With this in mind, it becomes clear that coronal loops are a rarity on the solar surface, as the majority of closed-flux structures are empty. This means the mechanism that heats the corona and injects chromospheric plasma into the closed magnetic flux is highly localised.<ref>{{cite journal\n  | last = Litwin\n  | first = C.\n  |author2=R.

The mechanism(s) must be stable enough to continue to feed the corona with chromospheric plasma and powerful enough to accelerate and therefore heat the plasma from 6000&nbsp;K to well over 1&nbsp;MK over the short distance from the chromosphere and transition region to the corona. This is the very reason coronal loops are targeted for intense study. They are anchored to the photosphere, are fed by chromospheric plasma, protrude into the transition region and exist at coronal temperatures after undergoing intensive heating.\n\nThe idea that the coronal heating problem is solely down to some coronal heating mechanism is misleading. Firstly, the plasma filling over-dense loops is drained directly from the chromosphere. There is no coronal mechanism known that can compress coronal plasma and feed it into coronal loops at coronal altitudes. Secondly, observations of coronal upflows point to a chromospheric source of plasma. The plasma is therefore chromospheric in origin; there must be consideration of this when looking into coronal heating mechanisms. This is a ''chromospheric energization'' and ''coronal heating phenomenon'' possibly linked through a common mechanism.\n\n{{unsolved|physics|Why is the Sun's Corona so much hotter than the Sun's surface?}}\n\n==History of observations==\n\n===1946\u20131975===\nMany strides have been made by ground-based telescopes (such as the [[Mauna Loa Solar Observatory]], MLSO, in [[Hawaii]]) and [[eclipse]] observations of the corona, but to escape the obscuring effect of the [[Earth]]'s atmosphere, space-based observations have become a necessary evolution for solar physics. Beginning with the short (seven-minute) [[Aerobee (rocket)|Aerobee]] rocket flights in 1946 and 1952, [[spectrogram]]s measured solar EUV and [[Lyman alpha|Lyman-\u03b1]] emissions. Basic [[X-ray]] observations were attained by 1960 using such rockets. The [[Skylark (rocket)|British Skylark rocket]] missions from 1959 to 1978 also returned mainly X-ray [[spectrometer]] data.<ref>{{cite journal\n  | last = Boland\n  | first = B. C. |author2=E. P.

SOHO continually faces the Sun holding a slow orbit around the First [[Lagrangian Point]] (L1), where the gravitational balance between the Sun and Earth provides a stable position for SOHO to orbit.

Hot glowing [[ionization|ionized]] gas ([[plasma (physics)|plasma]]) trapped in the loops makes them visible.  Coronal loops range widely in size up to several thousand kilometers long.  They are transient features of the solar surface, forming and dissipating over periods of seconds to days. They form the basic structure of the lower [[corona]] and [[solar transition region|transition region]] of the Sun. These highly structured loops are a direct consequence of the twisted solar [[magnetic flux]] within the solar body.  Coronal loops are associated with [[sunspot]]s; the two \"footpoints\" where the loop passes through the sun's surface are often sunspots.  This is because sunspots occur at regions of high magnetic field.  The high magnetic field where the loop passes through the surface forms a barrier to [[convection]] currents, which bring hot [[plasma (physics)|plasma]] from the interior to the sun's surface, so the plasma in these high field regions is cooler than the rest of the sun's surface, appearing as a dark spot when viewed against the rest of the photosphere. The population of coronal loops varies with the 11 year [[solar cycle]], which also influences the number of sunspots.\n\n==Origin and physical features==\n[[Image:Twistedflux.png|thumb|A diagram showing the evolution of the solar magnetic flux over one solar cycle.]]\n[[Image:Cartoonloops.png|thumb|Diagram of the low [[corona]] and [[solar transition region|transition region]], where many scales of coronal loops can be observed.]]\n\nDue to a natural process called the [[solar dynamo]] driven by heat produced in the Sun's core, [[convection|convective]] motion of the [[electrical conductivity|electrically conductive]] [[ionization|ionized]] gas ([[plasma (physics)|plasma]]) which makes up the Sun creates [[electric current]]s, which in turn create powerful [[magnetic field]]s in the Sun's interior.  These magnetic fields are in the form of closed loops of [[magnetic flux]], which are twisted and tangled by the different rotation rates of the gas at different latitudes of the solar sphere. A coronal loop occurs when a curved arc of the magnetic field projects through the visible surface of the Sun, the [[photosphere]], protruding into the solar atmosphere.\n\nWithin the magnetic field, the paths of the moving [[electric charge|electrically charged]] particles ([[electron]]s and [[ion]]s) which make up the Sun's gas are sharply bent by the field when moving transverse to the field, so they can only move freely parallel to the magnetic field lines, tending to spiral around the lines.  Thus the gas within a coronal loop cannot escape sideways out of the loop but is trapped in the loop and can only flow along its length.  The higher temperature in the Sun's atmosphere causes this gas to glow, making the loop visible through telescopes.  Coronal loops are ideal structures to observe when trying to understand the transfer of energy from the solar body, through the transition region and into the corona.\n\nThe strong interaction of the magnetic field with the dense plasma on and below the sun's surface tends to cause the magnetic field lines to be \"tied\" to the motion of the sun's gas, so the two 'footpoints' where the loop enters the photosphere are anchored to the sun's surface, and rotate with the surface.  Within each footpoint, the strong magnetic flux tends to inhibit the [[convection current]]s which carry hot gas from the sun's interior to the surface, so the footpoints are often (but not always) cooler than the surrounding photosphere.  These appear as dark spots on the sun's surface; [[sunspot]]s.  Thus sunspots tend to occur under coronal loops, and tend to come in pairs of opposite [[magnetic polarity]]; a point where the magnetic field loop emerges from the photosphere is a North [[magnet|magnetic pole]], and the other where the loop enters the surface again is a South magnetic pole.  \n\nCoronal loops form in a wide range of sizes, from 10&nbsp;km to 10,000&nbsp;km.  A related phenomenon, open [[flux tube]]s of magnetic field extend from the surface far into the corona and heliosphere and are the source of the sun's large scale magnetic field ([[magnetosphere]]) and the [[solar wind]].   Coronal loops have a wide variety of temperatures along their lengths. Loops at temperatures below 1&nbsp;[[megakelvin]]&nbsp;(MK) are generally known as cool loops, those existing at around 1&nbsp;MK are known as warm loops, and those beyond 1&nbsp;MK are known as hot loops. Naturally, these different categories radiate at different wavelengths.<ref>{{cite journal\n  | last = Vourlidas\n  | first = A.\n  |author2=J. A. Klimchuk |author3=C. M. Korendyke |author4=T. D.

With this in mind, it becomes clear that coronal loops are a rarity on the solar surface, as the majority of closed-flux structures are empty. This means the mechanism that heats the corona and injects chromospheric plasma into the closed magnetic flux is highly localised.<ref>{{cite journal\n  | last = Litwin\n  | first = C.\n  |author2=R.

The mechanism(s) must be stable enough to continue to feed the corona with chromospheric plasma and powerful enough to accelerate and therefore heat the plasma from 6000&nbsp;K to well over 1&nbsp;MK over the short distance from the chromosphere and transition region to the corona. This is the very reason coronal loops are targeted for intense study. They are anchored to the photosphere, are fed by chromospheric plasma, protrude into the transition region and exist at coronal temperatures after undergoing intensive heating.\n\nThe idea that the coronal heating problem is solely down to some coronal heating mechanism is misleading. Firstly, the plasma filling over-dense loops is drained directly from the chromosphere. There is no coronal mechanism known that can compress coronal plasma and feed it into coronal loops at coronal altitudes. Secondly, observations of coronal upflows point to a chromospheric source of plasma. The plasma is therefore chromospheric in origin; there must be consideration of this when looking into coronal heating mechanisms. This is a ''chromospheric energization'' and ''coronal heating phenomenon'' possibly linked through a common mechanism.\n\n{{unsolved|physics|Why is the Sun's Corona so much hotter than the Sun's surface?}}\n\n==History of observations==\n\n===1946\u20131975===\nMany strides have been made by ground-based telescopes (such as the [[Mauna Loa Solar Observatory]], MLSO, in [[Hawaii]]) and [[eclipse]] observations of the corona, but to escape the obscuring effect of the [[Earth]]'s atmosphere, space-based observations have become a necessary evolution for solar physics.
