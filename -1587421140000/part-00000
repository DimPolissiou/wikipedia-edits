This included the capital city and the surrounding areas where the king effectively exercised his government: the area in and around royal capital of [[Trowulan]], port of Canggu and sections of [[Brantas River]] valley near the capital, as well as the mountainous areas south and southwest of the capital, all the way to the [[Mount Penanggungan|Pananggungan]] and [[Arjuno-Welirang]] peaks. The Brantas river valley corridor, connecting the Majapahit Trowulan area to Canggu and the estuarine areas in Kahuripan (Sidoarjo) and [[Janggala|Hujung Galuh]] (Surabaya), is also considered to be part of ''Negara Agung''.\n# '''''Mancanegara''''', the areas surrounding ''Negara Agung'' \u2014 this traditionally referred to the Majapahit provinces of East and Central Java ruled by the ''Bhres'' (dukes), the king's close relatives. This included the rest of [[Java]] as well as [[Madura]] and [[Bali]]. These areas were directly influenced by Majapahit court culture and obliged to pay annual tributes; their rulers might have been directly related to, allied with, and/or intermarried with the Majapahit royal family. Majapahit officials and officers were stationed in these places to regulate their foreign trade activities and collect taxes, but beyond this ''mancanegara'' provinces enjoyed substantial autonomy in internal affairs. In later periods, overseas provinces which had adopted Javanese culture or possessed significant trading importance were also considered ''mancanegara''. The ruler of these provinces was either a willing vassal of the Majapahit king or a regent appointed by the king to rule the region. These realms included [[Melayu Kingdom|Dharmasraya]], [[Pagaruyung Kingdom|Pagaruyung]], [[Lampung]] and [[Palembang]] in [[Sumatra]].\n# '''''Nusantara''''', areas which did not reflect Javanese culture, but were included as colonies which had to pay annual tribute.

Macduff responds that he too would have such vices if he were king and then signals his loyalty to Scotland (\"O Scotland, Scotland!\" &ndash; Macduff, Act 4.3 100). They concur that maybe no one is fit to rule such a fine land. This leads Malcolm to trust Macduff (\"Macduff, this noble passion, Child of integrity, hath from my soul Wiped the black scruples, reconciled my thoughts To thy good truth and honor.\" &ndash; Malcolm, Act 4.3 114&ndash; 17). Upon news that Macduff's family was slain, Malcolm urges Macduff to take arms with him against Macbeth (\"Be this the whetstone of your sword. Let grief Convert to anger; blunt not the heart, enrage it.\" &ndash; Malcolm, Act 4.3 228&ndash;229).

If he 'scape, Heaven forgive him too!\" &ndash; Macduff, Act 4.3 233&ndash;35) as the scene ends. In the scene Malcolm learns that manhood is more than aggression when Macduff tells him that he must also grieve for his loss (\"Dispute it like a man.\" &ndash; Malcolm, Act 4.3 220; \"I shall do so, / But I must also feel it as a man.\" &ndash; Macduff, Act 4.3 220&ndash;21).\n\nMalcolm raises an army in England,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cliffsnotes.com/literature/m/macbeth/character-analysis/malcolm|title=Character Analysis: Malcolm|accessdate=24 April 2014|work=[[Cliff Notes]]}}</ref> and marches on Scotland with [[Macduff (Macbeth)|Macduff]] to reclaim his birthright from Macbeth. The Scottish noblemen lend their support to restore order to the land after observing Macbeth's extreme behaviour. In Act 5.4, Malcolm confers with Englishman [[Sigurd the Dane|Siward]] (the Elder) and his officers about strategies for obscuring their forces (\"Let very soldier hew him down a bough And bear't before him. Thereby shall we shadow The numbers of our host, and make discovery Err in report of us.\" &ndash; Malcolm, 5.4 4&ndash;7) and about Macbeth's defence plans (\"We learn no other but the confident tyrant Keeps still in Dunsinane, and will endure Our setting down before't.\" &ndash; Siward, 5.4 8&ndash;10). In Act 5.6, the battle commences as Malcolm, Macduff and Siward command forces against Dunsinane Castle. In Act 5.8 Malcolm and Siward storm Macbeth's castle. Siward receives news that his son was slain. Malcolm consoles him with an opportunity to grieve. Macduff enters with Macbeth's head and declares Malcolm the King (\"Hail, King! for so thou art: behold, where stands Th' usurpers cursed head.\" &ndash; Macduff, 5.8 54&ndash;55). Malcolm takes over as king and notes that order has been restored and that his intentions are good (\"by the grace of Grace We will perform in measure, time, and place:\" &ndash; Malcolm, Act 5.8 72&ndash;73).

In the scene Malcolm learns that manhood is more than aggression when Macduff tells him that he must also grieve for his loss (\"Dispute it like a man.\" &ndash; Malcolm, Act 4.3 220; \"I shall do so, / But I must also feel it as a man.\" &ndash; Macduff, Act 4.3 220&ndash;21).\n\nMalcolm raises an army in England,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cliffsnotes.com/literature/m/macbeth/character-analysis/malcolm|title=Character Analysis: Malcolm|accessdate=24 April 2014|work=[[Cliff Notes]]}}</ref> and marches on Scotland with [[Macduff (Macbeth)|Macduff]] to reclaim his birthright from Macbeth. The Scottish noblemen lend their support to restore order to the land after observing Macbeth's extreme behaviour. In Act 5.4, Malcolm confers with Englishman [[Sigurd the Dane|Siward]] (the Elder) and his officers about strategies for obscuring their forces (\"Let very soldier hew him down a bough And bear't before him. Thereby shall we shadow The numbers of our host, and make discovery Err in report of us.\" &ndash; Malcolm, 5.4 4&ndash;7) and about Macbeth's defence plans (\"We learn no other but the confident tyrant Keeps still in Dunsinane, and will endure Our setting down before't.\" &ndash; Siward, 5.4 8&ndash;10). In Act 5.6, the battle commences as Malcolm, Macduff and Siward command forces against Dunsinane Castle. In Act 5.8 Malcolm and Siward storm Macbeth's castle. Siward receives news that his son was slain. Malcolm consoles him with an opportunity to grieve. Macduff enters with Macbeth's head and declares Malcolm the King (\"Hail, King! for so thou art: behold, where stands Th' usurpers cursed head.\" &ndash; Macduff, 5.8 54&ndash;55). Malcolm takes over as king and notes that order has been restored and that his intentions are good (\"by the grace of Grace We will perform in measure, time, and place:\" &ndash; Malcolm, Act 5.8 72&ndash;73).

Textbooks are produced to meet the needs of educators, usually at educational institutions. '''Schoolbooks''' are textbooks and other books used in schools.<ref>{{AHDict|schoolbook}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/schoolbook|title=schoolbook - definition of schoolbook in English from the Oxford dictionary|accessdate=23 April 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160818041404/http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/schoolbook|archivedate=18 August 2016}}</ref> Today, many textbooks are published in both print format and digital formats.\n\n==History==\nThe history of textbooks dates back to ancient civilizations. For example, [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greeks]] wrote educational texts. The modern textbook has its roots in the mass production made possible by the printing press. [[Johannes Gutenberg]] himself may have printed editions of ''Ars Minor'', a schoolbook on Latin grammar by [[Aelius Donatus]]. Early textbooks were used by tutors and teachers (e.g. alphabet books), as well as by individuals who taught themselves.\n\nThe Greek philosopher [[Socrates]] lamented the loss of knowledge because the media of transmission were changing.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://wondermark.com/socrates-vs-writing/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-05-12 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130130020156/http://wondermark.com/socrates-vs-writing/ |archivedate=2013-01-30 }} True Stuff: Socrates vs. the Written Word, January 27th, 2011. By David Malki</ref> Before the invention of the [[Greek alphabet]] 2,500 years ago, knowledge and stories were recited aloud, much like [[Homer]]'s epic poems. The new technology of writing meant stories no longer needed to be memorized, a development Socrates feared would weaken the Greeks' mental capacities for memorizing and retelling. (Ironically, we know about Socrates' concerns only because they were written down by his student [[Plato]] in his famous Dialogues.) <ref>Marcia Clemmitt, \"Learning Online Literacy,\" in \"Reading Crisis?\" CQ Researcher, Feb. 22, 2008, pp. 169-192.</ref>\n\nThe next revolution in the field of books came with the 15th-century invention of printing with changeable type. The invention is attributed to German metalsmith Johannes Gutenberg, who cast type in molds using a melted metal alloy and constructed a wooden-screw [[printing press]] to transfer the image onto paper.\n\nGutenberg's first and only large-scale printing effort was the now iconic [[Gutenberg Bible]] in the 1450s \u2014 a Latin translation from the Hebrew Old Testament and the [[Greek New Testament]]. Gutenberg's invention made mass production of texts possible for the first time. Although the Gutenberg Bible itself was expensive, printed books began to spread widely over European trade routes during the next 50 years, and by the 16th century, printed books had become more widely accessible and less costly.<ref>British Library, \"Treasures in Full: Gutenberg Bible,\" http://www.bl.uk/treasures/gutenberg/background.html.</ref>\n\nWhile many textbooks were already in use, [[compulsory education]] and the resulting growth of schooling in Europe led to the printing of many more textbooks for children. Textbooks have been the primary teaching instrument for most children since the 19th century. Two textbooks of historical significance in United States schooling were the 18th century [[New England Primer]] and the 19th century [[McGuffey Readers]].\n\nRecent technological advances have changed the way people interact with textbooks. Online and digital materials are making it increasingly easy for students to access materials other than the traditional print textbook. Students now have access to electronic books (\"e-books\"), online tutoring systems and video lectures. An example of an e-book is ''[[Principles of Biology]]'' from [[Nature Publishing Group|Nature Publishing]].\n\nMost notably, an increasing number of authors are avoiding commercial publishers and instead offering their textbooks under a [[creative commons]] or other open license.\n\n==Market==\n\n===The market for textbooks===\nAs in many industries, the number of providers has declined in recent years (there are just a handful of major textbook companies in the USA).<ref>Rose, Marla Matzer.

Books that are not being re-used at the school are often purchased by an off-campus wholesaler for 0-30% of the new cost, for distribution to other bookstores.  Some textbook companies have countered this by encouraging teachers to assign homework that must be done on the publisher's website. Students with a new textbook can use the pass code in the book to register on the site; otherwise they must pay the publisher to access the website and complete assigned homework.\n\nStudents who look beyond the campus bookstore can typically find lower prices. With the ISBN or title, author and edition, most textbooks can be located through online used book sellers or retailers.\n\nMost leading textbook companies publish a new edition every 3 or 4 years, more frequently in math and science. Harvard economics chair James K. Stock has stated that new editions are often not about significant improvements to the content. \"New editions are to a considerable extent simply another tool used by publishers and textbook authors to maintain their revenue stream, that is, to keep up prices.\" <ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2008/3/4/professors-find-differents-uses-for-textbook |title=Professors Find Different Uses for Textbook Profits |first1=Alissa |last1=D\u2019gama |first2=Benjamin |last2=Jaffe |publisher=The Harvard Crimson |date=March 4, 2008 |access-date=July 14, 2019 }}</ref>  A study conducted by The Student [[Public Interest Research Group|PIRGs]] found that a new edition costs 12% more than a new copy of the previous edition (not surprising if the old version is obsolete), and 58% more than a used copy of the previous edition.

Students often cannot buy these things separately, and often the one-time-use supplements destroy the resale value of the textbook.<ref name=\"required-reading\">[http://www.studentpirgs.org/textbooks/reports/required-reading Required Reading: A Look at the Words Publishing Tactics at Work] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100314064817/http://www.studentpirgs.org/textbooks/reports/required-reading |date=2010-03-14 }}, The Student PIRGs (2006)</ref>\n\nAccording to the Student PIRGs, the typical bundled textbook is 10%-50% more{{clarify|date=January 2019}} than an unbundled textbook, and 65% of professors said they \u201crarely\u201d or \u201cnever\u201d use the bundled items in their courses.<ref name=\"ripoff-101\"/>\n\nA 2005 [[Government Accountability Office]] (GAO) Report in the USA found that the production of these supplemental items was the primary cause of rapidly increasing prices:\n<blockquote>\nWhile publishers, retailers, and wholesalers all play a role in textbook pricing, the primary factor contributing to increases in the price of textbooks has been the increased investment publishers have made in new products to enhance instruction and learning...While wholesalers, retailers, and others do not question the quality of these materials, they have expressed concern that the publishers\u2019 practice \nof packaging supplements with a textbook to sell as one unit limits the opportunity students have to purchase less expensive used books....If publishers continue to increase these investments, particularly in technology, the cost to produce a textbook is likely to continue to increase in the future.<ref name=GAO>\"[http://www.gao.gov/docsearch/abstract.php?rptno=GAO-05-806 College Textbooks: Enhanced Offerings Appear to Drive Recent Price Increases] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080619071824/http://www.gao.gov/docsearch/abstract.php?rptno=GAO-05-806 |date=2008-06-19 }}.\" U.S. Government Accountability Office, Washington, DC, 2005.

Each combination of a textbook and supplemental items receives a separate ISBN. A single textbook could therefore have dozens of ISBNs that denote different combinations of supplements packaged with that particular book. When a bookstore attempts to track down used copies of textbooks, they will search for the ISBN the course instructor orders, which will locate only a subset of the copies of the textbook.\n\nLegislation at state and federal levels seeks to limit the practice of bundling, by requiring publishers to offer all components separately.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">[http://www.studentpirgs.org/textbooks/campaign/hr4137 Analysis of Textbook Affordability Provisions in H.R. 4137] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091124161237/http://www.studentpirgs.org/textbooks/campaign/hr4137 |date=2009-11-24 }}, The Student PIRGs</ref>  Publishers have testified in favor of bills including this provision,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.leg.state.co.us/CLICS/CLICS2008A/commsumm.nsf/58e6d054c29cbe1287256e5f00670a70/78f66284de2d10b28725740400734883?OpenDocument|title=House Committee on Education (03/06/2008)|accessdate=23 April 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080413042944/http://www.leg.state.co.us/CLICS/CLICS2008A/commsumm.nsf/58e6d054c29cbe1287256e5f00670a70/78f66284de2d10b28725740400734883?OpenDocument|archivedate=13 April 2008}}</ref>  but only in the case that the provision exempts the loosely defined category of \"integrated textbooks.\"  The Federal bill<ref>\"[http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d110:h.r.04137: Higher Education Opportunity Act] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080921103240/http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d110:h.r.04137: |date=2008-09-21 }}.\" H.R.4137, U.S. House of Representatives, 110th Congress (2007-2008.)

Students can sell to 1) the college/university bookstore; 2) fellow students; 3) a number of online websites; or 4) a student swap service.\n\n====Campus buyback====\nAs for buyback on a specific campus, faculty decisions largely determine how much a student receives. If a professor chooses to use the same book the following semester, even if it is a custom text, designed specifically for an individual instructor, bookstores often buy the book back. The GAO report found that, generally, if a book is in good condition and will be used on the campus again the next term, bookstores will pay students 50 percent of the original price paid. If the bookstore has not received a faculty order for the book at the end of the term and the edition is still current, they may offer students the wholesale price of the book, which could range from 5 to 35 percent of the new retail price, according to the GAO report.<ref name=GAO/>\n\nWhen students resell their textbooks during campus \u201cbuyback\u201d periods, these textbooks are often sold into the national used textbook distribution chain.  If a textbook is not going to be used on campus for the next semester of courses then many times the college bookstore will sell that book to a national used book company.  The used book company then resells the book to another college bookstore.  Finally, that book is sold as used to a student at another college at a price that is typically 75% of the new book price. At each step, a markup is applied to the book to enable the respective companies to continue to operate.\n\n====Student to student sales====\nStudents can also sell or trade textbooks among themselves. After completing a course, sellers will often seek out members of the next enrolling class, people who are likely to be interested in purchasing the required books. This may be done by posting flyers to advertise the sale of the books or simply soliciting individuals who are shopping in the college bookstore for the same titles. Many larger schools have independent websites set up for the purpose of facilitating such trade. These often operate much like digital classified ads, enabling students to list their items for sale and browse for those they wish to acquire. Also, at the [[US Air Force Academy]], it is possible to [[e-mail]] entire specific classes, allowing for an extensive network of textbook sales to exist.\n\n====Student online marketplaces====\nOnline marketplaces are one of the two major types of online websites students can use to sell used textbooks. Online marketplaces may have an [[Online auction business model|online auction]] format or may allow the student to list their books for a fixed price. In either case, the student must create the listing for each book themselves and wait for a buyer to order, making the use of marketplaces a more passive way of selling used textbooks. Unlike campus buyback and online book, students are unlikely to sell all their books to one buyer using online marketplaces, and will likely have to send out multiple books individually.\n\n====Online book buyers====\nOnline book buyers buy textbooks, and sometimes other types of books, with the aim of reselling them for a profit. Like online marketplaces, online book buyers operate year-round, giving students the opportunity to sell their books even when campus \"buyback\" periods are not in effect. Students enter the [[International Standard Book Number|ISBN]] numbers of the books they wish to sell and receive a price quote or offer. These online book buyers often offer \"free shipping\" (which in actuality is built into the offer for the book), and allow students to sell multiple books to the same source. Because online book buyers are buying books for resale, the prices they offer may be lower than students can get on online marketplaces. However, their prices are competitive, and they tend to focus on the convenience of their service. Some even claim that buying used textbooks online and selling them to online book buyers has a lower total cost than even textbook rental services.\n\n====Textbook exchanges====\nIn response to escalating textbook prices, limited competition, and to provide a more efficient system to connect buyers and sellers together, online textbook exchanges were developed. Most of today's sites handle buyer and seller payments, and usually deduct a small commission only after the sale is completed.\n\nAccording to textbook author [[Henry L. Roediger III|Henry L. Roediger]] (and Wadsworth Publishing Company senior editor Vicki Knight), the used textbook market is illegitimate, and entirely to blame for the rising costs of textbooks.  As methods of \"dealing with this problem\", he recommends making previous editions of textbooks obsolete, binding the textbook with other materials, and passing laws to prevent the sale of used books.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.psychologicalscience.org/observer/why-are-textbooks-so-expensive|magazine=Observer|publisher=Association for Psychological Science|title=Why Are Textbooks So Expensive?|author=Henry L.

The intent is to make users understand that the content of any textbook is the intellectual property of the author and/or the publisher, and that as such, subject to copyright. Obviously, this idea is completely opposed to the millennia-old tradition of the sale of [[used book]]s, and would make that entire industry illegal.\n\n==== E-textbooks ====\nAnother alternative to save money and obtaining the materials you are required are e-textbooks. The article \"E books rewrite the rules of education\" states that, alternately to spending a lot of money on textbooks, you can purchase an e-textbook at a small amount of the cost. With the growth of digital applications for iPhone, and gadgets like the Amazon kindle, e-textbooks are not an innovation, but have been \"gaining momentum\".<ref>{{Cite web|title = Ebooks Rewrite the Rules of Education|url = http://www.econtentmag.com/Articles/News/News-Feature/Ebooks-Rewrite-the--Rules-of-Education-53676.htm|website = EContent Magazine|last = Mullan|first = Eileen|date = 4 May 2009|url-status = live|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20180317231848/http://www.econtentmag.com/Articles/News/News-Feature/Ebooks-Rewrite-the--Rules-of-Education-53676.htm|archivedate = 17 March 2018}}</ref> According to the article \" Are textbooks obsolete?\", publishers and editorials are concerned about the issue of expensive textbooks. \"The expense of textbooks is a concern for students, and e-textbooks, address the face of the issue, Williams says \" As publishers we understand the high cost of these materials, and the electronic format  permit us diminish the general expense of our content to the market\".<ref>{{Cite web|title = Are textbooks obsolete?

Some stores use a hybrid of both methods, opting for in-store selections of the most popular books and the online option for more obscure titles or books they consider too risky to put in the rental system. My daddy left me for milk so sorry if I'm a little down. [[Trustworthy Parents]].\n\n=== Textbook sharing ===\nAnother method to help students save money that is coming up is called Textbooks Sharing. Using textbook sharing the students share the physical textbook with other students, and also the cost of the book is divided among the users of the textbook. So over the life of the textbook, if 4 students use the textbook, the cost of the textbook for each student will be 25% of the total cost of the book.\n\n=== Open textbooks ===\n{{main|Open textbook}}\nThe latest trend in textbooks is \"open textbooks.\" An [[open textbook]] is a free, openly licensed textbook offered online by the copyright holders.  According to PIRG, a number of textbooks already exist, and are being used at schools such as MIT and Harvard.<ref>See PIRG's [http://www.studentpirgs.org/open-textbooks/catalog Catalog of Open Textbooks] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100324125700/http://www.studentpirgs.org/open-textbooks/catalog |date=2010-03-24 }} for examples of open textbooks</ref> A 2010 study published found that open textbooks offer a viable and attractive means to meet faculty and student needs while offering savings of approximately 80% compared to traditional textbook options.<ref>[http://www.studentpirgs.org/uploads/66/4d/664d09ba9bc97cc9138eda5faac5e061/A-Cover-To-Cover-Solution.pdf A Cover to Cover Solution] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101226015800/http://www.studentpirgs.org/uploads/66/4d/664d09ba9bc97cc9138eda5faac5e061/A-Cover-To-Cover-Solution.pdf |date=2010-12-26 }} by Nicole Allen of the Student PIRGs. 2010.</ref>\n\nAlthough the largest question seems to be who is going to pay to write them, several state policies suggest that public investment in open textbooks might make sense.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/pub/07-08/bill/asm/ab_2251-2300/ab_2261_bill_20080221_introduced.html|title=AB 2261 Assembly Bill - INTRODUCED|accessdate=23 April 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304135209/http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/pub/07-08/bill/asm/ab_2251-2300/ab_2261_bill_20080221_introduced.html|archivedate=4 March 2016}}</ref>{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}} To offer another perspective{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}, any jurisdiction might find itself challenged to find sufficient numbers of credible academics who would be willing to undertake the effort of creating an open textbook without realistic compensation, in order to make such a proposal work. Currently, some open textbooks have been funded with non-profit investment.\n\nThe other challenge involves the reality of publishing, which is that textbooks with good sales and profitability subsidize the creation and publication of low demand but believed to be necessary textbooks.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}  Subsidies skew markets and the elimination of subsidies is disruptive; in the case of low demand textbooks the possibilities following subsidy removal include any or all of the following: higher retail prices, a switch to open textbooks, a reduction of the number of titles published.\n\nOn the other hand, independent open textbook authoring and publishing models are developing.  Most notably, the startup publisher [[Flat World Knowledge]] already has dozens of college-level open textbooks that are used by  more than 900 institutions in 44 countries.<ref>[http://pressitt.com/smnr/Flat-World-Knowledge-President-Eric-Frank-Addresses-Oregon-Legislators-on-Solving-Textbook-Affordability-/3569/ Flat World Knowledge President Eric Frank Addresses Oregon Legislators on Solving Textbook Affordability.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110223233038/http://pressitt.com/smnr/Flat-World-Knowledge-President-Eric-Frank-Addresses-Oregon-Legislators-on-Solving-Textbook-Affordability-/3569/ |date=2011-02-23 }} Pressitt.

Retailers and publishers have expressed concern about the re-importation of lower-priced textbooks from international locations. Specifically, they cited the ability students have to purchase books from online distribution channels outside the United States at lower prices, which may result in a loss of sales for U.S. retailers. Additionally, the availability of lower-priced textbooks through these channels has heightened distrust and frustration among students regarding textbook prices, and college stores find it difficult to explain why their textbook prices are higher, according to the National Association of College Stores. Retailers and publishers have also been concerned that some U.S. retailers may have engaged in reimportation on a large scale by ordering textbooks for entire courses at lower prices from international distribution channels.  While the 1998 [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] decision [[Quality King v. L'anza]] protects the reimportation of copyrighted materials under the [[first-sale doctrine]], textbook publishers have still attempted to prevent the U.S. sale of international editions by enforcing contracts which forbid foreign wholesalers from selling to American distributors.<ref>{{cite news |first=Tamar |last=Lewin |title=Students Find $100 Textbooks Cost $50, Purchased Overseas |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/10/21/us/students-find-100-textbooks-cost-50-purchased-overseas.html |newspaper=The New York Times |date=21 October 2003 |accessdate=24 September 2009 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090916004116/http://www.nytimes.com/2003/10/21/us/students-find-100-textbooks-cost-50-purchased-overseas.html |archivedate=16 September 2009 }}</ref> Concerned about the effects of differential pricing on college stores, the National Association of College Stores has called on publishers to stop the practice of selling textbooks at lower prices outside the United States.<ref>{{cite web|title=Testimony of Marc L.

The authors often getting half-royalties instead of full-royalties, minus the charges for returned books from bookstores.\n\n===Production===\n\n====Cost distribution====\nAccording to the National Association of College Stores, the entire cost of the book is justified by expenses, with typically 11.7% of the price of a new book going to the author's royalties (or a committee of editors at the publishing house), 22.7% going to the store, and 64.6% going to the publisher.  The store and publisher amounts are slightly higher for Canada. {{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}\nBookstores and used-book vendors profit from the resale of textbooks on the used market, with publishers only earning profits on sales of new textbooks.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}\n\n====Research====\nAccording to the GAO study published July 2005:\n\n<blockquote>\nFollowing closely behind annual increases in tuition and fees at postsecondary institutions, college textbook and supply prices have risen at twice the rate of annual inflation over the last two decades.\n\nRising at an average of 6 percent each year since academic year 1987-1988, compared with overall average price increases of 3 percent per year, college textbook and supply prices trailed tuition and fee increases, which averaged 7 percent per year. Since December 1986, textbook and supply prices have nearly tripled, increasing by 186 percent, while tuition and fees increased by 240 percent and overall prices grew by 72 percent. While increases in textbook and supply prices have followed increases in tuition and fees, the cost of textbooks and supplies for degree-seeking students as a percentage of tuition and fees varies by the type of institution attended. For example, the average estimated cost of books and supplies per first-time, full-time student for academic year 2003-2004 was $898 at 4-year public institutions, or about 26 percent of the cost of tuition and fees. At 2-year public institutions, where low-income students are more likely to pursue a degree program and tuition and fees are lower, the average estimated cost of books and supplies per first-time, full-time student was $886 in academic year 2003-2004, representing almost three-quarters of the cost of tuition and fees.<ref name=GAO/>\n</blockquote>\n\nAccording to the 2nd edition of a study by the United States Public Interest Research Group (US PIRG) published in February 2005{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}: ''\"Textbook prices are increasing at more than four times the inflation rate for all finished goods, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics Producer Price Index. The wholesale prices charged by textbook publishers have jumped 62 percent since 1994, while prices charged for all finished goods increased only 14 percent. Similarly, the prices charged by publishers for general books increased just 19 percent during the same time period.\"''\n\nAccording to the 2007 edition of the College Board's Trend in College Pricing Report published October 2007{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}: ''\"College costs continue to rise and federal student aid has shown slower growth when adjusted for inflation, while textbooks, as a percentage of total college costs, have remained steady at about 5 percent.\"''\n\n==K-12 textbooks==\nIn most U.S. [[K-12]] public schools, a local school board votes on which textbooks to purchase from a selection of books that have been approved by the state Department of Education. Teachers receive the books to give to the students for each subject. Teachers are usually not required to use textbooks, however, and many prefer to use other materials instead.\n\nTextbook publishing in the U.S. is a business primarily aimed at large states. This is due to state purchasing controls over the books, most notably in Texas, where the [[Texas Education Agency]] sets curricula for all courses taught by the state's 1,000+ school districts, and therefore also approves which textbooks can be purchased.\n\n===High school===\nIn recent years, high school textbooks of United States history have come under increasing criticism. Authors such as [[Howard Zinn]] (''[[A People's History of the United States]]''), [[Gilbert T. Sewall]] (''[[Textbooks: Where the Curriculum Meets the Child]]'') and [[James W. Loewen]] (''[[Lies My Teacher Told Me: Everything Your American History Textbook Got Wrong]]''), make the claim that [[History of the United States|U.S. history]] textbooks contain mythical untruths and omissions, which paint a whitewashed picture that bears little resemblance to what most students learn in universities. Inaccurately retelling history, through textbooks or other literature, has been practiced in many societies, from ancient [[Rome]] to the [[Soviet Union]] (USSR) and the [[People's Republic of China]]. The content of history textbooks is often determined by the political forces of state adoption boards and ideological pressure groups.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}\n\nScience textbooks have been the source of ongoing debates and have come under scrutiny from several organizations. The presentation or inclusion of controversial scientific material has been debated in several court cases. Poorly designed textbooks have been cited as contributing to declining grades in mathematics and science in the United States and organizations such as the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] (AAAS) have criticized the layout, presentation, and amount of material given in textbooks.\n\nDiscussions of textbooks have been included on [[Creationism|creation]] and [[evolution]] in the public education debate. The ''[[Smith v. Board of School Commissioners of Mobile County]]'' case brought forward a debate about scientific fact being presented in textbooks.\n\nIn his book, ''[[Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!]]'', the late physics [[Nobel Prize]] laureate [[Richard P. Feynman]] described his experiences as a member of a committee that evaluated science textbooks.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://textbooks.org/2012/09/book-review-surely-youre-joking-mr-feynman/|title=Book Review: Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!|work=Textbooks.org - Compare Textbook Prices|accessdate=23 April 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160508135103/http://textbooks.org/2012/09/book-review-surely-youre-joking-mr-feynman/|archivedate=8 May 2016}}</ref> At some instances, there were nonsensical examples to illustrate physical phenomena; then a company sent \u2014 for reasons of timing \u2014 a textbook that contained blank pages, which even got good critiques. Feynman himself experienced attempts at bribery.\n\n== Mathematics ==\n{{unreferenced section|date=May 2016}}\nLargely in the US, but increasingly in other nations, K-12 Mathematics textbooks have reflected the controversies of [[new math]] and [[reform mathematics]] which have sought to replace [[traditional mathematics]] in what have been called the [[math wars]]. Traditional texts, still favored in Asia and other areas, merely taught the same time-tested mathematics that most adults have learned. By contrast \"progressive\" approaches seek to address problems in social inequity{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} with approaches that often incorporate principles of [[Constructivist teaching methods|constructivism]] and discovery. Texts such as [[Investigations in Numbers, Data, and Space|TERC]] and [[Connected Mathematics|CMP]] discourage or omit standard mathematics methods and concepts such as long division and lowest common denominators. For example, an index entry to multiply fractions would lead to \"devise your own method to multiply fractions which work on these examples\", and the formula for the area of a circle would be an exercise for a student to derive rather than including it in the student text. By the 2000s, while some districts were still adopting the more novel methods, others had abandoned them as unworkable.\n\n==Higher education==\nIn the U.S., college and university textbooks are chosen by the professor teaching the course, or by the department as a whole. Students are typically responsible for obtaining their own copies of the books used in their courses, although alternatives to owning textbooks, such as textbook rental services and library reserve copies of texts, are available in some instances.\n\nIn some European countries, such as Sweden or Spain, students attending institutions of higher education pay for textbooks themselves, although higher education is free of charge otherwise.\n\nWith higher education costs on the rise, many students are becoming sensitive to every aspect of college pricing, including textbooks, which in many cases amount to one tenth of tuition costs.

For example, [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greeks]] wrote educational texts. The modern textbook has its roots in the mass production made possible by the printing press. [[Johannes Gutenberg]] himself may have printed editions of ''Ars Minor'', a schoolbook on Latin grammar by [[Aelius Donatus]]. Early textbooks were used by tutors and teachers (e.g. alphabet books), as well as by individuals who taught themselves.\n\nThe Greek philosopher [[Socrates]] lamented the loss of knowledge because the media of transmission were changing.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://wondermark.com/socrates-vs-writing/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-05-12 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130130020156/http://wondermark.com/socrates-vs-writing/ |archivedate=2013-01-30 }} True Stuff: Socrates vs. the Written Word, January 27th, 2011. By David Malki</ref> Before the invention of the [[Greek alphabet]] 2,500 years ago, knowledge and stories were recited aloud, much like [[Homer]]'s epic poems. The new technology of writing meant stories no longer needed to be memorized, a development Socrates feared would weaken the Greeks' mental capacities for memorizing and retelling. (Ironically, we know about Socrates' concerns only because they were written down by his student [[Plato]] in his famous Dialogues.) <ref>Marcia Clemmitt, \"Learning Online Literacy,\" in \"Reading Crisis?\" CQ Researcher, Feb. 22, 2008, pp. 169-192.</ref>\n\nThe next revolution in the field of books came with the 15th-century invention of printing with changeable type. The invention is attributed to German metalsmith Johannes Gutenberg, who cast type in molds using a melted metal alloy and constructed a wooden-screw [[printing press]] to transfer the image onto paper.\n\nGutenberg's first and only large-scale printing effort was the now iconic [[Gutenberg Bible]] in the 1450s \u2014 a Latin translation from the Hebrew Old Testament and the [[Greek New Testament]]. Gutenberg's invention made mass production of texts possible for the first time. Although the Gutenberg Bible itself was expensive, printed books began to spread widely over European trade routes during the next 50 years, and by the 16th century, printed books had become more widely accessible and less costly.<ref>British Library, \"Treasures in Full: Gutenberg Bible,\" http://www.bl.uk/treasures/gutenberg/background.html.</ref>\n\nWhile many textbooks were already in use, [[compulsory education]] and the resulting growth of schooling in Europe led to the printing of many more textbooks for children. Textbooks have been the primary teaching instrument for most children since the 19th century. Two textbooks of historical significance in United States schooling were the 18th century [[New England Primer]] and the 19th century [[McGuffey Readers]].\n\nRecent technological advances have changed the way people interact with textbooks. Online and digital materials are making it increasingly easy for students to access materials other than the traditional print textbook. Students now have access to electronic books (\"e-books\"), online tutoring systems and video lectures. An example of an e-book is ''[[Principles of Biology]]'' from [[Nature Publishing Group|Nature Publishing]].\n\nMost notably, an increasing number of authors are avoiding commercial publishers and instead offering their textbooks under a [[creative commons]] or other open license.\n\n==Market==\n\n===The market for textbooks===\nAs in many industries, the number of providers has declined in recent years (there are just a handful of major textbook companies in the USA).<ref>Rose, Marla Matzer.

Books that are not being re-used at the school are often purchased by an off-campus wholesaler for 0-30% of the new cost, for distribution to other bookstores.  Some textbook companies have countered this by encouraging teachers to assign homework that must be done on the publisher's website. Students with a new textbook can use the pass code in the book to register on the site; otherwise they must pay the publisher to access the website and complete assigned homework.\n\nStudents who look beyond the campus bookstore can typically find lower prices. With the ISBN or title, author and edition, most textbooks can be located through online used book sellers or retailers.\n\nMost leading textbook companies publish a new edition every 3 or 4 years, more frequently in math and science. Harvard economics chair James K. Stock has stated that new editions are often not about significant improvements to the content. \"New editions are to a considerable extent simply another tool used by publishers and textbook authors to maintain their revenue stream, that is, to keep up prices.\" <ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2008/3/4/professors-find-differents-uses-for-textbook |title=Professors Find Different Uses for Textbook Profits |first1=Alissa |last1=D\u2019gama |first2=Benjamin |last2=Jaffe |publisher=The Harvard Crimson |date=March 4, 2008 |access-date=July 14, 2019 }}</ref>  A study conducted by The Student [[Public Interest Research Group|PIRGs]] found that a new edition costs 12% more than a new copy of the previous edition (not surprising if the old version is obsolete), and 58% more than a used copy of the previous edition.

Each combination of a textbook and supplemental items receives a separate ISBN. A single textbook could therefore have dozens of ISBNs that denote different combinations of supplements packaged with that particular book. When a bookstore attempts to track down used copies of textbooks, they will search for the ISBN the course instructor orders, which will locate only a subset of the copies of the textbook.\n\nLegislation at state and federal levels seeks to limit the practice of bundling, by requiring publishers to offer all components separately.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">[http://www.studentpirgs.org/textbooks/campaign/hr4137 Analysis of Textbook Affordability Provisions in H.R. 4137] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091124161237/http://www.studentpirgs.org/textbooks/campaign/hr4137 |date=2009-11-24 }}, The Student PIRGs</ref>  Publishers have testified in favor of bills including this provision,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.leg.state.co.us/CLICS/CLICS2008A/commsumm.nsf/58e6d054c29cbe1287256e5f00670a70/78f66284de2d10b28725740400734883?OpenDocument|title=House Committee on Education (03/06/2008)|accessdate=23 April 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080413042944/http://www.leg.state.co.us/CLICS/CLICS2008A/commsumm.nsf/58e6d054c29cbe1287256e5f00670a70/78f66284de2d10b28725740400734883?OpenDocument|archivedate=13 April 2008}}</ref>  but only in the case that the provision exempts the loosely defined category of \"integrated textbooks.\"  The Federal bill<ref>\"[http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d110:h.r.04137: Higher Education Opportunity Act] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080921103240/http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d110:h.r.04137: |date=2008-09-21 }}.\" H.R.4137, U.S. House of Representatives, 110th Congress (2007-2008.)

Students can sell to 1) the college/university bookstore; 2) fellow students; 3) a number of online websites; or 4) a student swap service.\n\n====Campus buyback====\nAs for buyback on a specific campus, faculty decisions largely determine how much a student receives. If a professor chooses to use the same book the following semester, even if it is a custom text, designed specifically for an individual instructor, bookstores often buy the book back. The GAO report found that, generally, if a book is in good condition and will be used on the campus again the next term, bookstores will pay students 50 percent of the original price paid. If the bookstore has not received a faculty order for the book at the end of the term and the edition is still current, they may offer students the wholesale price of the book, which could range from 5 to 35 percent of the new retail price, according to the GAO report.<ref name=GAO/>\n\nWhen students resell their textbooks during campus \u201cbuyback\u201d periods, these textbooks are often sold into the national used textbook distribution chain.  If a textbook is not going to be used on campus for the next semester of courses then many times the college bookstore will sell that book to a national used book company.  The used book company then resells the book to another college bookstore.  Finally, that book is sold as used to a student at another college at a price that is typically 75% of the new book price. At each step, a markup is applied to the book to enable the respective companies to continue to operate.\n\n====Student to student sales====\nStudents can also sell or trade textbooks among themselves. After completing a course, sellers will often seek out members of the next enrolling class, people who are likely to be interested in purchasing the required books. This may be done by posting flyers to advertise the sale of the books or simply soliciting individuals who are shopping in the college bookstore for the same titles. Many larger schools have independent websites set up for the purpose of facilitating such trade. These often operate much like digital classified ads, enabling students to list their items for sale and browse for those they wish to acquire. Also, at the [[US Air Force Academy]], it is possible to [[e-mail]] entire specific classes, allowing for an extensive network of textbook sales to exist.\n\n====Student online marketplaces====\nOnline marketplaces are one of the two major types of online websites students can use to sell used textbooks. Online marketplaces may have an [[Online auction business model|online auction]] format or may allow the student to list their books for a fixed price. In either case, the student must create the listing for each book themselves and wait for a buyer to order, making the use of marketplaces a more passive way of selling used textbooks. Unlike campus buyback and online book, students are unlikely to sell all their books to one buyer using online marketplaces, and will likely have to send out multiple books individually.\n\n====Online book buyers====\nOnline book buyers buy textbooks, and sometimes other types of books, with the aim of reselling them for a profit. Like online marketplaces, online book buyers operate year-round, giving students the opportunity to sell their books even when campus \"buyback\" periods are not in effect. Students enter the [[International Standard Book Number|ISBN]] numbers of the books they wish to sell and receive a price quote or offer. These online book buyers often offer \"free shipping\" (which in actuality is built into the offer for the book), and allow students to sell multiple books to the same source. Because online book buyers are buying books for resale, the prices they offer may be lower than students can get on online marketplaces. However, their prices are competitive, and they tend to focus on the convenience of their service. Some even claim that buying used textbooks online and selling them to online book buyers has a lower total cost than even textbook rental services.\n\n====Textbook exchanges====\nIn response to escalating textbook prices, limited competition, and to provide a more efficient system to connect buyers and sellers together, online textbook exchanges were developed. Most of today's sites handle buyer and seller payments, and usually deduct a small commission only after the sale is completed.\n\nAccording to textbook author [[Henry L. Roediger III|Henry L. Roediger]] (and Wadsworth Publishing Company senior editor Vicki Knight), the used textbook market is illegitimate, and entirely to blame for the rising costs of textbooks.  As methods of \"dealing with this problem\", he recommends making previous editions of textbooks obsolete, binding the textbook with other materials, and passing laws to prevent the sale of used books.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.psychologicalscience.org/observer/why-are-textbooks-so-expensive|magazine=Observer|publisher=Association for Psychological Science|title=Why Are Textbooks So Expensive?|author=Henry L. Roediger, III|date=January 2005|accessdate=23 April 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180317041203/https://www.psychologicalscience.org/observer/why-are-textbooks-so-expensive|archivedate=17 March 2018}}</ref> The concept is not unlike the limited licensing approach for computer software, which places rigid restrictions on resale and reproduction.  The intent is to make users understand that the content of any textbook is the intellectual property of the author and/or the publisher, and that as such, subject to copyright. Obviously, this idea is completely opposed to the millennia-old tradition of the sale of [[used book]]s, and would make that entire industry illegal.\n\n==== E-textbooks ====\nAnother alternative to save money and obtaining the materials you are required are e-textbooks. The article \"E books rewrite the rules of education\" states that, alternately to spending a lot of money on textbooks, you can purchase an e-textbook at a small amount of the cost. With the growth of digital applications for iPhone, and gadgets like the Amazon kindle, e-textbooks are not an innovation, but have been \"gaining momentum\".<ref>{{Cite web|title = Ebooks Rewrite the Rules of Education|url = http://www.econtentmag.com/Articles/News/News-Feature/Ebooks-Rewrite-the--Rules-of-Education-53676.htm|website = EContent Magazine|last = Mullan|first = Eileen|date = 4 May 2009|url-status = live|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20180317231848/http://www.econtentmag.com/Articles/News/News-Feature/Ebooks-Rewrite-the--Rules-of-Education-53676.htm|archivedate = 17 March 2018}}</ref> According to the article \" Are textbooks obsolete?\", publishers and editorials are concerned about the issue of expensive textbooks. \"The expense of textbooks is a concern for students, and e-textbooks, address the face of the issue, Williams says \" As publishers we understand the high cost of these materials, and the electronic format  permit us diminish the general expense of our content to the market\".<ref>{{Cite web|title = Are textbooks obsolete?

Some stores use a hybrid of both methods, opting for in-store selections of the most popular books and the online option for more obscure titles or books they consider too risky to put in the rental system.\n\n=== Textbook sharing ===\nAnother method to help students save money that is coming up is called Textbooks Sharing. Using textbook sharing the students share the physical textbook with other students, and also the cost of the book is divided among the users of the textbook. So over the life of the textbook, if 4 students use the textbook, the cost of the textbook for each student will be 25% of the total cost of the book.\n\n=== Open textbooks ===\n{{main|Open textbook}}\nThe latest trend in textbooks is \"open textbooks.\" An [[open textbook]] is a free, openly licensed textbook offered online by the copyright holders.  According to PIRG, a number of textbooks already exist, and are being used at schools such as MIT and Harvard.<ref>See PIRG's [http://www.studentpirgs.org/open-textbooks/catalog Catalog of Open Textbooks] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100324125700/http://www.studentpirgs.org/open-textbooks/catalog |date=2010-03-24 }} for examples of open textbooks</ref> A 2010 study published found that open textbooks offer a viable and attractive means to meet faculty and student needs while offering savings of approximately 80% compared to traditional textbook options.<ref>[http://www.studentpirgs.org/uploads/66/4d/664d09ba9bc97cc9138eda5faac5e061/A-Cover-To-Cover-Solution.pdf A Cover to Cover Solution] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101226015800/http://www.studentpirgs.org/uploads/66/4d/664d09ba9bc97cc9138eda5faac5e061/A-Cover-To-Cover-Solution.pdf |date=2010-12-26 }} by Nicole Allen of the Student PIRGs. 2010.</ref>\n\nAlthough the largest question seems to be who is going to pay to write them, several state policies suggest that public investment in open textbooks might make sense.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/pub/07-08/bill/asm/ab_2251-2300/ab_2261_bill_20080221_introduced.html|title=AB 2261 Assembly Bill - INTRODUCED|accessdate=23 April 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304135209/http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/pub/07-08/bill/asm/ab_2251-2300/ab_2261_bill_20080221_introduced.html|archivedate=4 March 2016}}</ref>{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}} To offer another perspective{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}, any jurisdiction might find itself challenged to find sufficient numbers of credible academics who would be willing to undertake the effort of creating an open textbook without realistic compensation, in order to make such a proposal work. Currently, some open textbooks have been funded with non-profit investment.\n\nThe other challenge involves the reality of publishing, which is that textbooks with good sales and profitability subsidize the creation and publication of low demand but believed to be necessary textbooks.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}  Subsidies skew markets and the elimination of subsidies is disruptive; in the case of low demand textbooks the possibilities following subsidy removal include any or all of the following: higher retail prices, a switch to open textbooks, a reduction of the number of titles published.\n\nOn the other hand, independent open textbook authoring and publishing models are developing.  Most notably, the startup publisher [[Flat World Knowledge]] already has dozens of college-level open textbooks that are used by  more than 900 institutions in 44 countries.<ref>[http://pressitt.com/smnr/Flat-World-Knowledge-President-Eric-Frank-Addresses-Oregon-Legislators-on-Solving-Textbook-Affordability-/3569/ Flat World Knowledge President Eric Frank Addresses Oregon Legislators on Solving Textbook Affordability.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110223233038/http://pressitt.com/smnr/Flat-World-Knowledge-President-Eric-Frank-Addresses-Oregon-Legislators-on-Solving-Textbook-Affordability-/3569/ |date=2011-02-23 }} Pressitt.

Retailers and publishers have expressed concern about the re-importation of lower-priced textbooks from international locations. Specifically, they cited the ability students have to purchase books from online distribution channels outside the United States at lower prices, which may result in a loss of sales for U.S. retailers. Additionally, the availability of lower-priced textbooks through these channels has heightened distrust and frustration among students regarding textbook prices, and college stores find it difficult to explain why their textbook prices are higher, according to the National Association of College Stores. Retailers and publishers have also been concerned that some U.S. retailers may have engaged in reimportation on a large scale by ordering textbooks for entire courses at lower prices from international distribution channels.  While the 1998 [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] decision [[Quality King v. L'anza]] protects the reimportation of copyrighted materials under the [[first-sale doctrine]], textbook publishers have still attempted to prevent the U.S. sale of international editions by enforcing contracts which forbid foreign wholesalers from selling to American distributors.<ref>{{cite news |first=Tamar |last=Lewin |title=Students Find $100 Textbooks Cost $50, Purchased Overseas |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/10/21/us/students-find-100-textbooks-cost-50-purchased-overseas.html |newspaper=The New York Times |date=21 October 2003 |accessdate=24 September 2009 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090916004116/http://www.nytimes.com/2003/10/21/us/students-find-100-textbooks-cost-50-purchased-overseas.html |archivedate=16 September 2009 }}</ref> Concerned about the effects of differential pricing on college stores, the National Association of College Stores has called on publishers to stop the practice of selling textbooks at lower prices outside the United States.<ref>{{cite web|title=Testimony of Marc L.

The authors often getting half-royalties instead of full-royalties, minus the charges for returned books from bookstores.\n\n===Production===\n\n====Cost distribution====\nAccording to the National Association of College Stores, the entire cost of the book is justified by expenses, with typically 11.7% of the price of a new book going to the author's royalties (or a committee of editors at the publishing house), 22.7% going to the store, and 64.6% going to the publisher.  The store and publisher amounts are slightly higher for Canada. {{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}\nBookstores and used-book vendors profit from the resale of textbooks on the used market, with publishers only earning profits on sales of new textbooks.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}\n\n====Research====\nAccording to the GAO study published July 2005:\n\n<blockquote>\nFollowing closely behind annual increases in tuition and fees at postsecondary institutions, college textbook and supply prices have risen at twice the rate of annual inflation over the last two decades.\n\nRising at an average of 6 percent each year since academic year 1987-1988, compared with overall average price increases of 3 percent per year, college textbook and supply prices trailed tuition and fee increases, which averaged 7 percent per year. Since December 1986, textbook and supply prices have nearly tripled, increasing by 186 percent, while tuition and fees increased by 240 percent and overall prices grew by 72 percent. While increases in textbook and supply prices have followed increases in tuition and fees, the cost of textbooks and supplies for degree-seeking students as a percentage of tuition and fees varies by the type of institution attended. For example, the average estimated cost of books and supplies per first-time, full-time student for academic year 2003-2004 was $898 at 4-year public institutions, or about 26 percent of the cost of tuition and fees. At 2-year public institutions, where low-income students are more likely to pursue a degree program and tuition and fees are lower, the average estimated cost of books and supplies per first-time, full-time student was $886 in academic year 2003-2004, representing almost three-quarters of the cost of tuition and fees.<ref name=GAO/>\n</blockquote>\n\nAccording to the 2nd edition of a study by the United States Public Interest Research Group (US PIRG) published in February 2005{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}: ''\"Textbook prices are increasing at more than four times the inflation rate for all finished goods, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics Producer Price Index. The wholesale prices charged by textbook publishers have jumped 62 percent since 1994, while prices charged for all finished goods increased only 14 percent. Similarly, the prices charged by publishers for general books increased just 19 percent during the same time period.\"''\n\nAccording to the 2007 edition of the College Board's Trend in College Pricing Report published October 2007{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}: ''\"College costs continue to rise and federal student aid has shown slower growth when adjusted for inflation, while textbooks, as a percentage of total college costs, have remained steady at about 5 percent.\"''\n\n==K-12 textbooks==\nIn most U.S. [[K-12]] public schools, a local school board votes on which textbooks to purchase from a selection of books that have been approved by the state Department of Education. Teachers receive the books to give to the students for each subject. Teachers are usually not required to use textbooks, however, and many prefer to use other materials instead.\n\nTextbook publishing in the U.S. is a business primarily aimed at large states. This is due to state purchasing controls over the books, most notably in Texas, where the [[Texas Education Agency]] sets curricula for all courses taught by the state's 1,000+ school districts, and therefore also approves which textbooks can be purchased.\n\n===High school===\nIn recent years, high school textbooks of United States history have come under increasing criticism. Authors such as [[Howard Zinn]] (''[[A People's History of the United States]]''), [[Gilbert T. Sewall]] (''[[Textbooks: Where the Curriculum Meets the Child]]'') and [[James W. Loewen]] (''[[Lies My Teacher Told Me: Everything Your American History Textbook Got Wrong]]''), make the claim that [[History of the United States|U.S. history]] textbooks contain mythical untruths and omissions, which paint a whitewashed picture that bears little resemblance to what most students learn in universities. Inaccurately retelling history, through textbooks or other literature, has been practiced in many societies, from ancient [[Rome]] to the [[Soviet Union]] (USSR) and the [[People's Republic of China]]. The content of history textbooks is often determined by the political forces of state adoption boards and ideological pressure groups.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}\n\nScience textbooks have been the source of ongoing debates and have come under scrutiny from several organizations. The presentation or inclusion of controversial scientific material has been debated in several court cases. Poorly designed textbooks have been cited as contributing to declining grades in mathematics and science in the United States and organizations such as the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] (AAAS) have criticized the layout, presentation, and amount of material given in textbooks.\n\nDiscussions of textbooks have been included on [[Creationism|creation]] and [[evolution]] in the public education debate. The ''[[Smith v. Board of School Commissioners of Mobile County]]'' case brought forward a debate about scientific fact being presented in textbooks.\n\nIn his book, ''[[Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!]]'', the late physics [[Nobel Prize]] laureate [[Richard P. Feynman]] described his experiences as a member of a committee that evaluated science textbooks.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://textbooks.org/2012/09/book-review-surely-youre-joking-mr-feynman/|title=Book Review: Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!|work=Textbooks.org - Compare Textbook Prices|accessdate=23 April 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160508135103/http://textbooks.org/2012/09/book-review-surely-youre-joking-mr-feynman/|archivedate=8 May 2016}}</ref> At some instances, there were nonsensical examples to illustrate physical phenomena; then a company sent \u2014 for reasons of timing \u2014 a textbook that contained blank pages, which even got good critiques. Feynman himself experienced attempts at bribery.\n\n== Mathematics ==\n{{unreferenced section|date=May 2016}}\nLargely in the US, but increasingly in other nations, K-12 Mathematics textbooks have reflected the controversies of [[new math]] and [[reform mathematics]] which have sought to replace [[traditional mathematics]] in what have been called the [[math wars]]. Traditional texts, still favored in Asia and other areas, merely taught the same time-tested mathematics that most adults have learned. By contrast \"progressive\" approaches seek to address problems in social inequity{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} with approaches that often incorporate principles of [[Constructivist teaching methods|constructivism]] and discovery. Texts such as [[Investigations in Numbers, Data, and Space|TERC]] and [[Connected Mathematics|CMP]] discourage or omit standard mathematics methods and concepts such as long division and lowest common denominators. For example, an index entry to multiply fractions would lead to \"devise your own method to multiply fractions which work on these examples\", and the formula for the area of a circle would be an exercise for a student to derive rather than including it in the student text. By the 2000s, while some districts were still adopting the more novel methods, others had abandoned them as unworkable.\n\n==Higher education==\nIn the U.S., college and university textbooks are chosen by the professor teaching the course, or by the department as a whole. Students are typically responsible for obtaining their own copies of the books used in their courses, although alternatives to owning textbooks, such as textbook rental services and library reserve copies of texts, are available in some instances.\n\nIn some European countries, such as Sweden or Spain, students attending institutions of higher education pay for textbooks themselves, although higher education is free of charge otherwise.\n\nWith higher education costs on the rise, many students are becoming sensitive to every aspect of college pricing, including textbooks, which in many cases amount to one tenth of tuition costs. The 2005 Government Accountability Office report on college textbooks said that since the 1980s, textbook and supply prices have risen twice the rate of inflation in the past two decades{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}.  A 2005 PIRG study found that textbooks cost students $900 per year, and that prices <ref name=GAO /> increased four times the rate of inflation over the past decade.<ref>[http://www.studentpirgs.org/textbooks/reports/ripoff-101-2nd-edition Rip-off 101: Second Edition] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100314064841/http://www.studentpirgs.org/textbooks/reports/ripoff-101-2nd-edition |date=2010-03-14 }}, The Student PIRGs (2005)</ref>  A June 2007 Advisory Committee on Student Financial Assistance (ACSFA) report, \u201cTurn the Page,\u201d reported that the average U.S. student spends $700\u2013$1000 per year on textbooks.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ed.gov/about/bdscomm/list/acsfa/edlite-txtbkstudy.html|title=Archived: Advisory Committee for Student Financial Assistance (ACSFA) - U.S. Department of Education|accessdate=23 April 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120509204934/http://www2.ed.gov/about/bdscomm/list/acsfa/edlite-txtbkstudy.html|archivedate=9 May 2012}}</ref>\n\nWhile many groups have assigned blame to publishers, bookstores or faculty, the ACSFA also found that assigning blame to any one party\u2014faculty, colleges, bookstores or publishers\u2014for current textbook costs is unproductive and without merit. The report called on all parties within the industry to work together to find productive solutions, which included a movement toward [[open textbook]]s and other lower-cost digital solutions.\n\nTextbook prices are considerably higher in law school. Students ordinarily pay close to $200 for case books consisting of cases available free online.\n\n==Textbook bias on controversial topics==\nIn cases of history, science, current events, and political textbooks, \"the writer might be biased towards one way or another. Topics such as actions of a country, presidential actions, and scientific theories are common potential biases\".{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[John Amos Comenius]] - \"the innovator who first introduced pictorial textbooks, written in native language instead of Latin, applied effective teaching based on the natural gradual growth from simple to more comprehensive concepts, supported lifelong learning and development of logical thinking by moving from dull memorization\"\n*[[Orbis Pictus]] - 1658 textbook by [[Comenius]], one of the first books with pictures for children\n*[[Casebook]] - A special type of textbook used in [[Law school in the United States|law schools in the United States]].\n*[[Kirtsaeng v.

The islands do not form a physical chain or group, but are frequently grouped together for tourist or administrative purposes. To the south are the [[Dodecanese]] islands; and to the west are the [[Cyclades]] and [[Sporades]] islands.\n\nWithin this group, the main islands in the northeastern Aegean Sea and along the Turkish coast are the Greek islands of [[Samos Island|Samos]], [[Ikaria]], [[Chios]], [[Lesbos]], [[Lemnos]], [[Agios Efstratios]], [[Psara]], [[Fournoi Korseon]], [[Oinousses]] and the Turkish islands of [[Imbros]] (G\u00f6k\u00e7eada), [[Tenedos]] (Bozcaada) and the [[Rabbit Islands (\u00c7anakkale)|Rabbit or ''Tav\u015fan'' Islands]]. The main islands in the [[Thracian Sea]] in the far north are the Greek islands of [[Samothrace]] and [[Thasos]].\n\n==History==\nFrom the [[Mesolithic Age]], the North Aegean, as indeed the entire Aegean, ceased to be an obstacle and became a bridge joining the inhabitants of the region. Shipping, trade, economy, culture and social interactions developed in the archipelago and surrounding areas on the basis of communication and contact between the inhabitants. This was especially true after the permanent settlement of the islands 5000 years BC.\n\nThe islands of the north Aegean were in such a position that shipping and trade contributed greatly to the development of a significant culture. The culture reaches its peak around 3000BC. The growth of settlements such as [[Poliochnis]] in Lemnos, [[Emporiou]] in Chios and [[Iraiou]] in Samos, amongst others, are evidence of the importance of these centers at this time.\n\nBy ca. 2000 BC the Ionians had installed themselves in Chios while Samos and Lesvos are in the hands of the [[Achaeans (Homer)|Achaeans]]. In the late 12th and early 11th centuries BC, a time when vast numbers of the people moved to Greece, the Aioleis arrived in Lesvos.\n\nFrom the 8th to the 5th century BC the islands enjoyed great prosperity in their economy, trade and the arts. The islands were conquered by the Persians in the [[Greco-Persian Wars]] in the 5th century BC. After their release in 468 BC they made an alliance with Athens. However, during the [[Peloponnesian War]] (429-404 BC ) their allegiance swayed between Athens and Sparta. In 338 BC the [[Macedon]]ians came into power followed by [[Ptolemaic Egypt]]. After this period the islands suffered the same fate as the rest of Greece by becoming the province of the [[Roman Empire]]. During the Byzantine era there is calm in the North Aegean, but from the 7th century on this was disrupted by Arab raids.\n\nAfter the [[Sack of Constantinople|conquest of Constantinople]] by the Franks in 1204 the islands find themselves shared amongst the Venetians, Genoese and Frank princes (''[[Frankokratia]]''). Under this rule shipping and trade flourished. The [[fall of Constantinople]] in 1453 and the founding of the [[Ottoman Empire]] resulted in a period of destruction, plundering and persecution for the islands. The occupation also led to the decline of the Christian population. In the early 16th century the islands began to enjoy a period of prosperity.\n\nThe inhabitants of the islands were actively involved in the [[Greek War of Independence]] and the emergence of leaders in the struggle such as [[Lykourgos Logothetis]], [[Constantine Kanaris]] and [[Dimitrios Papanikolis]] brought about reprisals from the Turkish authorities. The massacres of Chios in 1822 and Psara in 1824 brought attention from European powers which helped the Greek cause.\n\nHowever, due to their position, close to the Asia Minor coast, the Turks did not let go of their hold on the islands easily.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} It was not until 1912 when the islands of the north Aegean were finally incorporated into the Greek state during the [[First Balkan War]].\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|North Aegean}}\n*[http://www.greekhotel.gr/greek_island_hotels/aegean_islands_hotels/history.asp Aegean Islands History]\n\n{{Aegean Sea}}\n\n{{coord|37.8000|N|23.4500|E|source:wikidata|display=title}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n[[Category:North Aegean islands| ]]\n[[Category:Archipelagoes of Turkey]]\n[[Category:Archipelagoes of Greece]]\n", "text_old": "[[File:Aegean Sea with island groups labeled.gif|thumb|300px|right| '''North Aegean islands''' (center) are not in a physical chain.]]\n[[File:Northern Aegean relief location map.jpg|thumb|300px|right| Northern Aegean Sea map.]]\n\nThe '''North Aegean islands''' are a number of disconnected islands in the north [[Aegean Sea]], also known as the ''Northeast Aegean islands'', belonging to [[Greece]] and [[Turkey]].
