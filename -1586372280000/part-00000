{"title_page": "Military history of the Three Kingdoms", "text_new": "{{see also|Timeline of the Three Kingdoms period}}\n[[File:3K Gif-min.gif|thumb|500px|Timelapse of the [[Three Kingdoms]] period.]]\n{{Campaignbox End of Han}}\n{{Campaignbox Three Kingdoms}}\n{{Campaignbox Battles at Hefei}}\n{{Campaignbox Cao Pi's invasions of Eastern Wu}}\n{{Campaignbox Zhuge Northern Expeditions}}\n\nThe '''military history of the [[Three Kingdoms]]''' period encompasses roughly a century's worth of prolonged warfare and disorder. After the assassination of General-in-chief [[He Jin]] in September 189, the administrative structures of the Han government became increasingly irrelevant. By the time of death of [[Cao Cao]], the most successful warlord of North China, in 220, the Han empire was divided between the three rival states of [[Cao Wei]], [[Shu Han]] and [[Eastern Wu]]. Due to the ensuing turmoil, the competing powers of the Three Kingdoms era found no shortage of willing recruits for their armies, although press-ganging as well as forcible enlistment of prisoners from defeated armies still occurred. Following four centuries of rule under the [[Han dynasty]], the [[Three Kingdoms]] brought about a new era of conflict in [[China]] that shifted institutions in favor of a more permanent and selective system of military recruitment. This ultimately included the creation of a hereditary military class as well as increasing reliance on non-Chinese cavalry forces and the end of universal conscription.\n\n==Organization==\n[[File:3Kshield.jpg|thumb|Wei shieldbearer]]\n[[File:Weijin soldiers.jpg|thumb|Wei-Jin shieldbearers]]\n[[File:Weijin cavalry.jpg|thumb|Wei-Jin cavalry]]\n[[File:Three Kingdoms battering ram.jpg|thumb|Battering ram of the [[Three Kingdoms]]]]\n\n===Recruitment and organization===\nAs the Han dynasty fell into disarray after the [[Yellow Turban Rebellion]], its system of conscription and checks on military leadership broke down, giving local leaders the autonomy to recruit their own personal armies. At the heart of each army was a group of trusted Companions (\u89aa\u8fd1 ''qinjin'') consisting of family members, close friends and clansmen hired by whatever means was available to their lord. [[Cao Cao]]'s earliest commanders who formed the nucleus of his army were all clansmen ([[Cao Xiu]], [[Cao Zhen]], [[Cao Chun]]). There was no need for conscription as the conflicts of the late Han dynasty created willing recruits who sought protection under a strong army. This type of soldier, characterized by a lack of loyalty to state or nation, primarily concerned with survival, made up the majority of the army outside of the leader's close following.{{sfn|di Cosmo|2009|p=110-111}}{{sfn|Graff|2002|p=38}} Due to the lack of loyalty among common troops, acts of heroism and courage were particularly emphasized among commanders who were expected to lead from the front. A typical example of this type of commander would be [[Dian Wei]], a former local bully noted for his great strength, appetite, and his choice of weaponry, two halberds of immense weight, who served under [[Cao Cao]]. In 195, he personally led a group of volunteers clad in double armour (\u5169\u93a7 ''liang kai'') against [[L\u00fc Bu]]'s forces while his liege made his escape. He was promoted to colonel of the bodyguard unit known as the Tiger Warriors and later met his death against [[Zhang Xiu (warlord)|Zhang Xiu]] in 197.{{sfn|de Crespigny|2010|p=172-173}}<ref>{{cite web|url=https://openresearch-repository.anu.edu.au/html/1885/42048/mil_org.html|title=Later Han Military Organisation|access-date=July 25, 2018}}{{Dead link|date=April 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> While echoes of Han organization continued through the formal titles of military structure, in effect the wars of the Three Kingdoms were fought between armies of bands led by individuals selected by dint of violence and charisma.{{sfn|de Crespigny|2010|p=186}}\n\n===Training===\nMilitary training programs for the general populace in the inner provinces were mostly discontinued after 30 AD to reduce the risk of rebellion. The total number of professional soldiers in standing armies in the Eastern Han, including all the smaller groups, amounted to approximately 20,000 soldiers. Expeditions and campaigns relied upon tens of thousands of troops from local militia armies and non-Chinese auxiliaries, supplemented by professional and semi-professional troops. {{sfn|Crespigny|2017|p=163}} The men in the inner provinces of the empire could be called to serve during emergencies or serve in local militias to fight against bandits, but these men received no formal training or regular exercise. On the other hand, men of the frontier provinces were liable for conscription and military service as before. {{sfn|de Crespigny|2010|p=154-155}} This had a negative impact on the performance of the Han army, as noted by [[Ying Shao]], who remarked that \"sending [such] men into battle without training is just throwing them away\".{{sfn|de Crespigny|2010|p=155}} The majority of soldiers recruited during the early stages of the Three Kingdoms period were thus \"neither disciplined nor well trained in the use of arms\".{{sfn|de Crespigny|2010|p=167-168}} Formations and drill still existed, but these were the exceptions rather than the norm, and there is no evidence of troops engaging in a regular training system or large scale exercises.{{sfn|de Crespigny|2010|p=168}} Most commanders favored simple rather than complex formations and maneuvers. An example of a formation that did exist is [[Zhuge Liang]]'s Eight Formation Plan, which included different configurations named after Heaven, Earth, Wind, and Clouds. It is not clear what these designations mean, but the Eight Formation Plan was traditionally a square formation composed of nine divisions in three sections.{{sfn|de Crespigny|2010|p=190}} The lack of training severely constrained the kind of orders a commander could give for his troops to follow. As a consequence of the limited tactical flexibility at their disposal, the majority of battles were carried out in one of two ways: a head on charge by elite shock troops followed by the loosely organized army of incoherent and disparately trained and equipped soldiers, or ambush and surprise the enemy before they could even respond and cause them to route.{{sfn|de Crespigny|2010|p=173-175}}\n\n{{quotation|Yuan Shao moved to attack Gongsun Zan and the two sides met in battle twenty li south of Jie Bridge. Gongsun Zan had thirty thousand foot soldiers in square formation and ten thousand horsemen split into left and right wings. His White Cavalry Volunteers followed in the center. They split in two, the left riding right, and the right riding left. Their armour and flags shined with brilliance, lighting up heaven and earth. Yuan Shao sent Qu Yi against them with eight hundred soldiers while a thousand crossbowmen on either side supported his advance. Yuan Shao himself led tens of thousands of soldiers from the rear. Qu Yi had resided in Liangzhou for a long time and was familiar with the way of war as practiced by the Qiang tribes. Seeing Qu Yi's small force, Gongsun Zan sent cavalry to crush them. Qu Yi's troops hid behind their shields and made no move until the enemy were ten or twenty yards away; then they leapt up together, their cries shaking the ground, rushing forward with crossbows shooting bolts like thunder, killing all who were struck, and completely defeated Gongsun Zan's army...... killing more than a thousand armed men, Yuan Shao's troops maintained their pursuit to Jie Bridge. Gongsun Zan rallied his troops to turn and fight, but Qu Yi again defeated them.

For example, [[Cao Cao]]'s son, [[Cao Pi]], started his military education in early childhood. He began training in archery at the age of five, started learning how to ride a horse at the age of six, and could both ride and shoot a target at a hundred paces by the time he was eight.{{sfn|Lorge|2011|p=80-81}} Horse archery was also practiced in [[Shu Han]], which fielded a \"Flying Army\" of mounted archers.{{sfn|Peers|2006|p=83}}\n\n===Hereditary troops===\nIn contrast to the military hierarchy of the Han dynasty, leadership of a unit in the Three Kingdoms was functionally hereditary as long as the successor was loyal to his liege and proved militarily competent. When the commander died, a male member of his family inherited control of his troops, and when a soldier died one of his male relatives inherited his position in the unit. By the end of the Three Kingdoms, the term ''buqu'' (\u90e8\u66f2) had come to designate the institution of hereditary military leadership. Both ''bu'' and ''qu'', meaning battalions and companies, were originally units of military organization during the Han. Under Cao Cao, a more systematic form of hereditary soldiery was implemented through \"military families\" (\u58eb\u5bb6 ''shijia'') which later became \"hereditary troops\" (\u4e16\u5175 ''shibing''). As their name implies, able male members born into military families served for life, and when they could no longer serve because of illness or death, their sons or close family members replaced them. Their families lived at the capital and other major centers where they could be used by the government as hostages to ensure the loyalty of their soldiers. They were also forbidden from marrying into non-military families in order to prevent their offspring from exiting the system, thus creating a closed community of military households. Although commoners could still be called up in times of urgent need, the rise of government mandated military communities under [[Cao Wei]] and the demobilization of local levies under the [[Jin dynasty (265\u2013420)|Jin dynasty]], had by and large, replaced the universal conscription of the Han.{{sfn|Graff|2002|p=38-39}}\n\n===Tuntian===\n[[Tuntian]], often rendered as \"[military] agricultural colonies,\" were self-sustaining farming communities created for the purpose of providing food for the military. Generally consisting of displaced peoples, refugees, and bandits, tenants of a tuntian were expected to protect themselves in times of emergencies and in return were exempt from corv\u00e9e labour. Unlike the tuntian system of the Han dynasty, which was generally hands off, the tuntian policy of the Three Kingdoms era was to directly provide them with supplies and material assistance. The policy of tuntian was implemented primarily by [[Cao Cao]], [[Tao Qian (Han dynasty)|Tao Qian]], and [[Gongsun Zan]].{{sfn|de Crespigny|2010|p=89-90}}\n\n==Equipment==\n[[File:3K arrow moulds.jpg|thumb|Three Kingdoms arrow mould]]\n[[File:Gold and Silver Inlaid Bronze Crossbow Trigger of General Sun Lin.jpg|thumb|[[Three Kingdoms]] [[crossbow]] trigger]]\n[[File:Three Kingdoms Iron Arrowheads.jpg|thumb|[[Three Kingdoms]] arrowheads]]\n[[File:3K spearhead and caltrops.jpg|thumb|Three Kingdoms caltrops and spearhead]]\nArmies of the Three Kingdoms era used largely the same equipment as the Han dynasty since it directly follows the end of the Han. There were however some minor differences and developments such as the increasing prevalence of armoured cavalry. In one battle, the warlord [[Cao Cao]] boasted that with only ten sets of horse armour he had faced an enemy with three hundred sets.{{sfn|Graff|2002|p=42}} The horse armour may however have just been partial frontal barding.{{sfn|Peers|2006|p=83}} Mounting [[stirrup]]s were already in use, possibly as early as the Han dynasty, but full riding stirrups would not appear until the 4th century.{{sfn|de Crespigny|2010|p=171-172}} References to \"dark armour\" (''xuan kai'' or ''xuan jia'' \u7384\u93a7/\u7384\u7532) and \"brilliant armour\" also began to appear in the 3rd century. This is probably in reference to the association of high quality steel with black ferrous material.{{sfn|Wagner|2008|p=322}}\n\nWeapons were largely the same as well, although there was more focus on idiosyncratic weapons wielded by particularly noteworthy individuals. For example, one man named Chen An apparently wielded a great sword over two meters in length{{sfn|Lorge|2011|p=80}} and [[Sun Quan]]'s wife had over a hundred female attendants armed with daos.{{sfn|Lorge|2011|p=86}} Trends in warfare that had already been underway during the Eastern Han continued to gain momentum. By the end of the Three Kingdoms, the single edged dao, with its thicker and more durable dull side, had overtaken the straight double-edged jian as the primary close combat weapon.{{sfn|Lorge|2011|p=78}} The more expensive, lighter, and less durable jian entered the domain of court dancers, officials, and expert warriors.{{sfn|Lorge|2011|p=83}} While halberds were still used during the period, long spears and lances (similar to pikes) re-rose in prominence over halberds for infantry and cavalry forces. This was believed to have been the result of the long spear and lances' simpler construction, the adoption of long spears and lances by heavy cavalry to strike infantrymen, and the adoption of tighter infantry formations with less room for swinging and hooking [of halberds] in response to the greater threat by cavalry. {{sfn|Lorge|2011|p=78}}{{sfn|Graff|2002|p=41}} Soldiers in the northeast specialized in long spears.<ref>(\u9b4f\u66f8\u66f0\uff1a\u8b70\u8005\u591a\u8a00\u300c\u95dc\u897f\u5175\u5f4a\uff0c\u7fd2\u9577\u77db\uff0c\u975e\u7cbe\u9078\u524d\u92d2\uff0c\u5247\u4e0d\u53ef\u4ee5\u7576\u4e5f\u300d\u3002\u516c\u8b02\u8af8\u5c07\u66f0\uff1a\u300c\u6230\u5728\u6211\uff0c\u975e\u5728\u8cca\u4e5f\u3002\u8cca\u96d6\u7fd2\u9577\u77db\uff0c\u5c07\u4f7f\u4e0d\u5f97\u4ee5\u523a\uff0c\u8af8\u541b\u4f46\u89c0\u4e4b\u8033\u3002\u300d) ''Wei Shu'' annotation in ''Sanguozhi'' vol. 1.</ref> After the Han dynasty, the crossbow gradually faded in importance until it made a mild resurgence during the [[Tang dynasty]], under which the ideal expeditionary army of 20,000 included 2,200 archers and 2,000 crossbowmen.{{sfn|Graff|2002|p=193}}\n\nReferences to \"great shields\" occur in their usage on the front line to protect spearmen and crossbowmen. Shields were also commonly paired with the single edged dao and used among cavalrymen.{{sfn|Peers|2006|p=146}} Descriptions of the [[Battle of Guandu]] mention that Cao Cao's soldiers employed shield cover above their heads each time they moved out into the open due to oppressive arrow fire from [[Yuan Shao]]'s wooden towers.{{sfn|de Crespigny|2010|p=142}}\n\nAlthough Zhuge Liang is often credited with the invention of the [[repeating crossbow]], this is actually due to a mistranslation confusing it with the multiple bolt crossbow. The source actually says Zhuge invented a multiple bolt crossbow that could shoot ten iron bolts simultaneously, each 20&nbsp;cm long.{{sfn|Liang|2006}}\n\n===Dark armour===\nA report in 231 AD mentions the capture of 5,000 suits of \"dark armour\" (''xuan kai'' or ''xuan jia'' \u7384\u93a7/\u7384\u7532) and 3,100 crossbows. Dark armour appears in Han texts as well, but only as the attire worn by honor guards at funeral processions. The only known trait about dark armour is that it reflected the sun's rays. This probably means dark armour was made of high quality steel, which was often associated with black ferrous material.{{sfn|Wagner|2008|p=322}}\n\n===Brilliant armour===\n[[Cao Zhi]] mentioned three different kinds of armour, two of which were variants of \"brilliant\" armour:\n\n{{quotation|The Previous Emperor presented your vassal with armor (kai), to wit, a suit of \"black-brilliant\" (heiguang) and one of \"bright-brilliant\" (mingguang) and a suit of \"double-faced\" (liangtang) armor, but now that the present age is peaceful and the weapons and armor (bingge) are not of use, I request leave to turn them all over to the Armor Board (kaicao) to be taken care of.{{sfn|Dien|1981|p=16}}|[[Cao Zhi]]}}\n\nBrilliant armour was made of decarburized steel, which shines blue-black when polished, giving it its name. [[Chen Lin (Han dynasty)|Chen Lin]] described brilliant armour in the following manner:\n\n{{quotation|As for the armor (kai) then like that of Quegong of the Eastern Barbarians,<br>It is made of the finest steel refined a hundred times;<br>The armorer has plied his hammer,<br>The leather-worker has made the stitching;<br> [Adorned with] dark feathers the flashing armor (jia)<br> Gleams and shines, throwing off light.{{sfn|Dien|1981|p=17}}|Chen Lin}}\n\n===Wheel catapult===\n[[Ma Jun]], a military engineer serving under [[Cao Wei]], devised a siege weapon which threw large stones using a wheel. This device consisted of a drum wheel attached with a curved knife. When rotated, the stones which hung on the wheel would be cut loose by the knife and launched. It is not clear how well this device worked in practice. Successful tests with roof tiles instead of stones are mentioned, but according to Liang Jieming, this contraption never made it past the testing phase and could not have been possible with the technology available at the time.{{sfn|Liang|2006}}\n\n===Special weapons===\nThe historical novel [[Romance of the Three Kingdoms]] attributes a number of fictional weapons, often with special names, to certain individuals. Examples include [[Liu Bei]]'s \"Paired Winding Swords\" (\u96d9\u80a1\u528d), [[Guan Yu]]'s \"[[Green Dragon Crescent Blade]]\" (\u9752\u9f8d\u5043\u6708\u5200), [[Zhang Fei]]'s \"Eighteen chi Serpent Lance\" (\u4e08\u516b\u86c7\u77db), [[Zhao Yun]]'s \"Blue Steel Sword\" (\u9752\u91ed\u528d), [[Cao Cao]]'s \"Sword of Heaven\" (\u501a\u5929\u528d), [[Sun Jian]]'s \"Ancient Ingot Blade\" (\u53e4\u9320\u5200), [[Cheng Pu]]'s \"Ironspine Serpent Lance\" (\u9435\u810a\u86c7\u77db), and L\u00fc Bu's \"Fangtianhua Ji\" (\u65b9\u5929\u756b\u621f), otherwise known as the \"Sky Piercer\" or \"Sky Piercing Halberd\". While these are completely fictional, the [[Records of the Three Kingdoms]] do mention weapons unique to individuals on at least two occasions: [[Dian Wei]]'s double halberd which weighed 20&nbsp;kg{{sfn|de Crespigny|2010|p=79}} and [[Gongsun Zan]]'s two-bladed spear.{{sfn|Lorge|2011|p=79}}\n\n==Single combat==\n[[File:Three Kingdoms daos.jpg|thumb|Daos from the Three Kingdoms period]]\n\nThe [[Records of the Three Kingdoms]] and [[Annotations to Records of the Three Kingdoms]] contain two instances of single combat between generals. In 192, after [[Dong Zhuo]] had been murdered, [[Li Jue (Han Dynasty)|Li Jue]] and [[Guo Si]] formed an army to oust [[Wang Yun (Han dynasty)|Wang Yun]] and [[L\u00fc Bu]] from [[Chang'an]]. When Guo Si approached the city from the north, L\u00fc Bu opened the gate and offered to settle the matter by single combat. Guo Si agreed and engaged with L\u00fc Bu, who pierced Guo Si with his lance.

Cao Cao became afraid of the enemies he had made at court so he left his post.{{sfn|de Crespigny|2007|p=35}}\n\nIn 188 Cao Cao became a colonel of the Western Garden. When [[Dong Zhuo]] seized power in 189, Cao Cao fled to [[Chenliu Commandery]], where he sold his family estates and raised troops to join [[Yuan Shao]] and the [[Campaign against Dong Zhuo]].

In the winter Cao Cao led a raiding party behind enemy lines and destroyed their supply train at the [[Battle of Guandu]], causing Yuan Shao's army to disintegrate. Meanwhile, Liu Bei had been making trouble in [[Ru'nan Commandery]] with the bandit [[Gong Du]]. With Yuan Shao no longer posing a threat, Cao Cao returned to deal with Liu Bei, driving him away to take refuge with Liu Biao.{{sfn|de Crespigny|2007|p=36-37}}\n\nIn the summer of 202, Yuan Shao died, leaving his territory to his sons. They fought among themselves and fell prey to Cao Cao's advances. By 205 he had ousted [[Yuan Tan]] and [[Yuan Shang]] from their southern territories. Over the next two years he brought [[Ji Province]] and southern [[Bing Province]] under his control. In the summer of 207 Cao Cao made a roundabout trip north and defeated the [[Wuhuan]] at the [[Battle of White Wolf Mountain]]. They fled to [[Gongsun Kang]] in [[Liaodong Commandery]], but he beheaded them and delivered their heads to Cao Cao.{{sfn|de Crespigny|2007|p=37}}\n\nAs Cao Cao prepared to campaign south in 208, Liu Biao died. His son [[Liu Zong]] surrendered while Liu Bei fled further south. Cao Cao followed and defeated Liu Bei at the [[Battle of Changban]]. Seizing the naval base at [[Jingzhou|Jiangling]], Cao Cao moved his new river fleet downstream. His confrontation with Liu Bei and the [[Sun Quan]]'s general [[Zhou Yu]] culminated in defeat and the destruction of his fleet at the [[Battle of Red Cliffs]]. Failing to cross the [[Changjiang]], Cao Cao retreated north.{{sfn|de Crespigny|2007|p=38}}\n\nIn 211 Cao Cao moved west against [[Zhang Lu (Han Dynasty)|Zhang Lu]] and in doing so also drew the ire of [[Ma Chao]] and [[Han Sui]]. They were outmaneuvered and defeated at the [[Battle of Tong Pass (211)|Battle of Tong Pass]]. In 212 Cao Cao left [[Xiahou Yuan]] behind to continue the northwestern campaign while he returned east to attack Sun Quan across the [[Huai River]]. The invasion forced reached the banks of the Changjiang but failed to break the enemy defenses. Cao Cao returned to [[Ye (Hebei)|Ye City]] in 213.{{sfn|de Crespigny|2007|p=38}}\n\nIn 215 Cao Cao eliminated Zhang Lu and occupied [[Hanzhong Commandery]]. Cao Cao attacked Sun Quan again in 217 after Sun Quan's failed attack in 215. However he was never able to make it past the Changjiang defenses but was able to gain Sun Quan's nominal surrender. In the spring of 219, his general Xiahou Yuan was killed at the [[Battle of Mount Dingjun]] and Cao Cao lost his position in Hanzhong Commandery. Liu Bei's general [[Guan Yu]] also defeated [[Yu Jin]]'s fores in [[Nanyang Commandery]] and laid siege to [[Cao Ren]] in [[Fancheng]]. However he was unable to take the city and was himself killed when Sun Quan's general [[L\u00fc Meng]] who took advantage of the situation and attacked him from behind.

Cao Pi deeply distrusted his close kin and reduced their powers out of suspicion of their loyalty. Cao Pi died in 226 and was succeeded by his son [[Cao Rui]]. Although Cao Rui was twenty years old, he was nonetheless appointed a regency council by his father prior to his death. By 236, three members of the regency council had died, leaving [[Sima Yi]] as the primary leader of Cao Wei. Before this time, [[Shu Han]] launch attacks on the Wei borders and in 229, [[Zhuge Liang]] occupied [[Wudu Commandery]].

He died two years later and was succeeded by his son [[Sima Shi]]. Cao Fang tried to retake power for himself in 254 but failed and was replaced by his cousin, [[Cao Mao]]. Sima Shi died in 255 and was succeeded by his brother [[Sima Zhao]]. In 260 Cao Mao, like his cousin, attempted to seize control of the state, but failed and died in the process. In 264 Sima Zhao conquered [[Shu Han]], eliminating one of the Three Kingdoms. He died the following year and was succeeded by his son [[Sima Yan]]. On 8 February 266, Sima Yan deposed the last emperor of Wei, [[Cao Huan]], and proclaimed himself Emperor of the [[Jin dynasty (265\u2013420)|Jin dynasty]].{{sfn|de Crespigny|2010|p=461}}\n\nSima Yan went on to annex the southern state of [[Eastern Wu]] in 280, putting an end to the period of the Three Kingdoms.{{sfn|de Crespigny|2010|p=461}}\n\n===Shu Han===\n[[File:Liu Bei Tang.jpg|thumb|[[Liu Bei]]]]\n[[File:\u4f0d\u4f2f\u753b\u50cf\u7816.jpg|thumb|Late Eastern Han-Three Kingdoms era brick relief of shieldbearers with spears from modern [[Sichuan]], the area occupied by Shu han]]\n[[Shu Han]] was founded by [[Liu Bei]] in 221 and was conquered by [[Cao Wei]] in 263.\n\n====Liu Bei====\n\n[[Liu Bei]] was a very distant descendant of [[Emperor Jing of Han]]. His father Liu Hong died when he was still very young and his mother made a living by selling straw sandals. In 175 Liu Bei was sent to study at the [[Taixue]] of [[Luoyang]], where he became friends with [[Gongsun Zan]]. Liu Bei had very little interest in books but had a knack for fighting and inspired many young men to join him. With the support of two merchants, Zhang Shiping and Su Shuang, Liu Bei was able to create a sizable following including his long time friends [[Guan Yu]] and [[Zhang Fei]]. When the [[Yellow Turban Rebellion]] broke out in 184 Liu Bei led his troops against them under various commanders. He did well in both campaigns but was only rewarded with a very low position in the imperial service. He abandoned his post when an officer tried to reduce his position and joined [[Guanqiu Yi]] on an expedition against rebels in [[Danyang Commandery]]. For his service in that expedition he was rewarded with the post of assistant magistrate in a county in [[Pingyuan Commandery]]. When the anti-[[Dong Zhuo]] coalition formed, Liu Bei raised troops in their service, but soon afterwards left to join his friend Gongsun Zan in the north.{{sfn|de Crespigny|2007|p=478-479}}\n\nLiu Bei assisted Gongsun Zan against his rival [[Yuan Shao]] in 191 and was given the post of magistrate in Pingyuan Commandery. His post didn't last long as Yuan Shao dealt a devastating blow to Gongsun Zan in 192 and Liu Bei was forced to move east to Qi Commandery. When [[Tao Qian (Han dynasty)|Tao Qian]] of [[Xu Province]] offered him 4,000 troops and a post in [[Pei Commandery]], Liu Bei accepted. Tao Qian died in 194 and Liu Bei succeeded him as Governor of Xu Province. In 196 [[Yuan Shu]] invaded from the south and fought Liu Bei for a month at a stalemate. During this time however, Liu Bei had lost [[Xiapi Commandery]] due to [[Zhang Fei]] killing its Chancellor allowing [[L\u00fc Bu]], who was at the time taking refuge in the province, to attack Liu Bei and forced him to surrender. Having defeated Liu Bei and taken control of Xu Province, L\u00fc Bu drove away Yuan Shu's army. Though he was defeated, Liu Bei still retained Pei Commandery. When Yuan Shu attacked Liu Bei again, L\u00fc Bu prevented his advance out of fear that Yuan Shu would become too powerful. Liu Bei continued to recruit troops until 198 when he intercepted a trade convoy from L\u00fc Bu. L\u00fc Bu's officers [[Gao Shun]] and [[Zhang Liao]] retaliated, taking Pei Commandery and forcing Liu Bei to flee to [[Cao Cao]]. Cao Cao sent an army under [[Xiahou Dun]] to assist Liu Bei against L\u00fc Bu. In the autumn their army was defeated by Gao Shun. When Cao Cao joined them in the winter, they successfully laid siege to L\u00fc Bu in Xiapi Commandery and killed him the following year.{{sfn|de Crespigny|2007|p=479}}\n\nIn 199 Liu Bei was sent to intercept Yuan Shu from making contact with Yuan Shao. When Liu Bei reached Xu Province, he rebelled, killing the Inspector [[Che Zhou]]. Cao Cao's initial attempt to suppress him ended in failure but the second one in 200 succeeded. Liu Bei abandoned his family and Guan Yu, who were captured, and fled to Yuan Shao in [[Qing Province]]. He was sent to [[Ru'nan Commandery]] to assist the bandit [[Gong Du]] but suffered defeat at the hands of Cao Cao's officer [[Cao Ren]].He was however able to defeat and kill Cao Cao's officer [[Cai Yang]]. Yuan Shao's army was defeated in 200 at the [[Battle of Guandu]] and Liu Bei was forced to take refuge with [[Liu Biao]] in [[Jing Province]].{{sfn|de Crespigny|2007|p=480}}\n\nStationed on the northern frontier of Jing Province, in 202 Liu Bei achieved victory against Xiahou Dun and [[Yu Jin]] at the [[Battle of Bowang]]. After that Cao Cao became preoccupied with the north while Liu Bei was recalled to court. During his stay with Liu Biao, Liu Bei recruited [[Zhuge Liang]], who would later become the leading military figure of Shu Han. In the autumn of 208 Liu Biao died and Cao Cao moved to invade. Liu Biao's son [[Liu Zong]] chose to surrender. Liu Bei led his followers south to the [[Changjiang]] where they were heavily defeated by Cao Cao at the [[Battle of Changban]] in [[Nan Commandery]]. While Cao Cao occupied the naval base at [[Jingzhou|Jiangling]], Liu Bei retreated to the southeast towards [[Battle of Xiakou|Xiakou]], and [[Zhou Yu]], general of [[Sun Quan]] to the east, came upriver with a sizable army. Having augmented his main army with Jing Province's fleet, Cao Cao continued his advance in the winter against Zhou Yu and Liu Bei's forces arrayed on the east bank of the Changjiang. Despite his superior numbers, Cao Cao was defeated at the [[Battle of Red Cliffs]] and his fleet was destroyed by a deployment of fire ships by Sun Quan's officer, [[Huang Gai]]. In the winter of 208-209 Liu Bei has conquered most of southern Jing while Zhou Yu had captured Jiangling thus ending any hope Cao Cao had of obtaining area across the Changjiang.{{sfn|de Crespigny|2007|p=481}}\n\nAfter [[Liu Qi (Liu Biao's son)|Liu Qi]] died in 208, Liu Bei became the Governor of Jing Province. Zhou Yu died in 210 and his successor [[Lu Su]] convinced Sun Quan to \"lend\"(give) Liu Bei Nan Commandery. In 211 [[Liu Zhang (warlord)|Liu Zhang]] invited Liu Bei to [[Yi Province]] as an ally. In 212 Liu Bei betrayed Liu Zhang and attacked him, waging a two-year war that ended in Liu Zhang's surrender and Liu Bei's conquest of Yi Province. In 215 Sun Quan demanded that Liu Bei give him all of southern Jing Province that Liu Bei had obtained. When Liu Bei denied his demands, Sun Quan sent an invasion force commanded by [[L\u00fc Meng]] and [[Lu Su]] and Liu Bei sent Guan Yu to confront the two in response while he gathers troops for an inevitable battle. A settlement was eventual reached, dividing southern Jing along the [[Xiang River]]. In 217 Liu Bei invaded [[Hanzhong Commandery]], which was then under the control of Cao Cao, and solidified his gains in 219 by achieving a decisive victory over the Cao army and killing [[Xiahou Yuan]].{{sfn|de Crespigny|2007|p=482}}\n\nIn the autumn of 219, Liu Bei proclaimed himself King of Hanzhong at a coronation ceremony in [[Mianyang]], and established a court in [[Chengdu]]. Liu Bei's general, Guan Yu, besieged [[Fan city]], in modern [[Xiangfan]], but Cao Cao's cousin [[Cao Ren]] held out and Cao Cao's officer [[Xu Huang]] came to his rescue and drove Guan Yu away from Fan Castle. In the winter while Guan Yu was fighting against Cao Ren an offensive by L\u00fc Meng into Nan Commandery ruined Guan Yu's position and he was killed by Lu Meng upon his capture. Sun Quan thus had seized all of Jing Province.{{sfn|de Crespigny|2007|p=483}}\n\nOn 15 May 221, Liu Bei proclaimed himself emperor. He then attacked Sun Quan through the [[Three Gorges]] and into the middle Changjiang. The following year [[Lu Xun]] destroyed Liu Bei's line of camps and forced him to retreat to Baidi Castle with heavy losses. Liu Bei fell ill soon after the battle and upon Sun Quan being under attack by the forces of [[Cao Pi]] the two reformed their alliance. Liu Bei died in the summer of 223 and was succeeded by his son [[Liu Shan]], though the government was effectively under the control of Zhuge Liang as a part of Liu Bei's dying request.{{sfn|de Crespigny|2007|p=483}}\n\n====Liu Shan====\n[[Liu Shan]] was only 17 years old when his father died and lacked the ability to lead so [[Zhuge Liang]] became de facto head of state. In 224 and 225 Zhuge Liang embarked on a [[Zhuge Liang's Southern Campaign|Southern Campaign]] which brought at least nominal submission from chieftains in the south of [[Yi Province]]. In the north Zhuge Liang made [[Zhuge Liang's Northern Expeditions|several attempts]] to break through the [[Qinling]] range, managing to occupy [[Wudu Commandery]] in 229. However he was unable to press farther north in his conflicts with [[Sima Yi]] and died in 234. Unlike the Sun and Cao regimes, Shu Han never managed to create anything more than an ad hoc warlord regime, probably because its leaders were not native to the region. In 264 Shu Han was conquered by [[Sima Zhao]], the de facto ruler of Cao Wei, whose son [[Sima Yan]] would go on to depose the Cao sovereign on 8 February 266, and proclaim himself emperor of the [[Jin dynasty (265\u2013420)|Jin dynasty]].{{sfn|de Crespigny|2010|p=461}}\n\n===Eastern Wu===\n[[File:Sun Quan Tang.jpg|thumb|[[Sun Quan]]]]\n[[File:Pottery courtyard, 3 kingdoms, Wu, Hubei, 1967.

Although his family was of no great importance, they were purportedly descendants of the military strategist [[Sun Zi]], who is traditionally credited with the authorship of ''The Art of War''. Whether the claimed ancestry is true or not, Sun Jian's family played little role in the affairs of the Han dynasty, and next to nothing is known about Sun Jian's obscure lineage.{{sfn|de Crespigny|2004|p=70-72}}\n\nAs a youth, Sun Jian was described as unusual in appearance, kind, intelligent, but fond of odd behavior. At the young age of 16 he was appointed a junior civil officer in the county administration. Sun Jian first made a name for himself at the age of 17 when he went on a trip with his father to [[Hangzhou|Qiantang]]. During the trip they heard of a band of pirates led by Hu Yu robbing nearby travelers. Sun Jian wanted to attack them while his father wanted nothing to do with the pirates. Even so, Sun Jian set out to confront the pirates. He climbed onto a hill overlooking their camp and waved his sword as if directing soldiers to attack. The pirates thought Sun Jian was part of a government force so they fled. Sun Jian chased after them and took one head as proof of his success. Thereafter, he was promoted to Commandant.{{sfn|de Crespigny|2004|p=77}}\n\nIn 172, Sun Jian was appointed Major of troops in Wu Commandery to put down a rebellion by [[Xu Chang]] in [[Kuaiji Commandery]]. Sun Jian's success against the rebels drew the attention of [[Zang Min]], who was in overall command of local forces. With Zang Min's recommendation, Sun Jian became Assistant in the county of [[Yandu]], [[Guangling Commandery]]. For the next ten years he remained an official in [[Xu Province]], where he gained a sizable following, and was well liked by those around him:\n\n{{quotation|Wherever Sun Jian went he gained a good reputation, and the officers and people loved him and trusted him.

Sun Jian looked after them and cared for them like his own family.{{sfn|de Crespigny|2004|p=84}}|''[[Sanguo Zhi]]''}}\n\nWhen the [[Yellow Turban Rebellion]] broke out in 184, Sun Jian was called up by [[Zhu Jun (Han dynasty)|Zhu Jun]] in Kuaiji Commandery, and appointed Associate Major. None could stand against him. Sun Jian constantly led at the forefront of his troops, being the first to scale the walls of [[Wancheng]], dealing the last great blow to the Yellow Turbans.{{sfn|de Crespigny|2004|p=32}} After the Yellow Turbans' defeat, Sun Jian was transferred over to the west to deal with the [[Liang Province rebellion]]. During his time there, he came to butt heads with [[Dong Zhuo]], who felt that Sun Jian was a good commander but lacked quality troops.{{sfn|de Crespigny|2004|p=96}}\n\nIn 186, Sun Jian returned to the capital and in 187 was promoted to Grand Administrator of [[Changsha Commandery]]. As Grand Administrator, Sun Jian destroyed the local rebels [[Ou Xing]], [[Zhou Chao]], and [[Guo Shi]], even aiding neighboring commanderies, much to the consternation of his clerical officers:\n\n{{quotation|I have none of the civil graces.

Even if I am committing a crime, why should I feel ashamed?{{sfn|de Crespigny|2004|p=99-100}}|Sun Jian, ''[[Sanguo Zhi]]''}}\n\nFor his service in defeating the rebels, Sun Jian was enfeoffed as Marquis of Wucheng, the highest noble rank attainable for a man outside of the imperial family.{{sfn|de Crespigny|2004|p=100}}\n\nWhen [[Dong Zhuo]] seized power at [[Luoyang]] in 189, Sun Jian joined [[Yuan Shu]] and the [[Campaign against Dong Zhuo|anti-Dong Zhuo coalition]]. When Sun Jian passed by [[Jing Province]], he killed its Inspector [[Wang Rui (civil servant)|Wang Rui]] as well as the Administrator of [[Nanyang Commandery]], [[Zhang Zhi (calligrapher)|Zhang Zhi]], and took over their troops. Sun Jian took the lead in the allied offensive but was defeated by [[Xu Rong (general)|Xu Rong]] in 191. After recovering from his losses, Sun Jian defeated [[Hu Zhen]] and captured the capital of Luoyang. Defending the devastated city however was unfeasible, so he retreated with the Imperial Seal in tow, and passed it down to Yuan Shu. While Sun Jian was attacking Luoyang, the alliance had already broken up, and [[Yuan Shao]]'s general [[Zhou Yu (Renming)]] attacked his base camp. Sun Jian returned and drove back Zhou Yu's army. Yuan Shu then sent him against [[Liu Biao]] in Jing Province, where Sun Jian died at the age of 37 in a skirmish near [[Xiangyang]].{{sfn|de Crespigny|2007|p=769}}\n\n{{quotation|Together we raised loyal troops, intending to bring aid to the nation.

Then he would arrive, and the men of his command respected order, and they did not dare to rob or plunder: not even chickens or dogs or vegetables were stolen. And so the people were extremely pleased, and they would all come to bring cattle and wine as a welcome to the army.{{sfn|de Crespigny|2004|p=161}}|''[[Sanguo Zhi]]''}}\n\n[[Sun Ce]], son of [[Sun Jian]], was 16 years old when his father died. His cousin, Sun Ben, whose father Sun Qiang had died in 175, took over his personal following and served under [[Yuan Shu]]. When Yuan Shu was driven to [[Jiujiang Commandery]] in 193, Sun Ce was given commission and sent south with some of his father's former troops. Sun Ce was defeated by [[Zu Lang]] and returned north the following year. He was granted another thousand troops and sent to take [[Lujiang Commandery]] from [[Lu Kang (Han dynasty)|Lu Kang]]. Although successful in his endeavor, he was not promoted as was promised by Yuan Shu. In 195 he was sent against [[Liu Yao]] in [[Yang Province]]. Sun Ce quickly took over the region and pushed Liu Yao to [[Yuzhang Commandery]]. By 197 when Yuan Shao declared himself emperor, Sun Ce had become the dominant power in Yang Province, so he rejected his former allegiance and allied himself to [[Cao Cao]]. In 198 Sun Ce invaded Lujiang Commandery and defeated [[Liu Xun (warlord)|Liu Xun]] and [[Huang Zu]]. In 200 the Administrator of Yuzhang Commandery surrendered. At this point [[Yan Baihu]] and [[Xu Gong]] rebelled, so Sun Ce returned east, killing Xu Gong. Before he could deal with Yan Baihu however, Sun Ce was ambushed and killed by Xu Gong's retainers.

Despite Cao Cao's overwhelming numerical superiority, his forces failed to cross the [[Changjiang]] and were defeated at the [[Battle of Red Cliff]] by an attack of fire ships from Sun Quan's officer [[Huang Gai]]. [[Cao Ren]] managed to hold onto [[Jingzhou|Jiangling]] for another year before retreating north.{{sfn|de Crespigny|2007|p=773}}\n\nLiu Qi died soon afterwards and [[Jing Province]] was split between Liu Bei and Sun Quan. While Sun Quan's forces were preparing to launch an invasion of [[Yi Province]] ruled by [[Liu Zhang (warlord)|Liu Zhang]], his general Zhou Yu fell ill and died in 209. Zhou Yu's successor [[Lu Su]] convinced Sun Quan to let Liu Bei \"borrow\" [[Nan Commandery]] in order to stabilize the situation on the western frontier. Meanwhile, Sun Quan established his capital at [[Jianye District|Jianye]], in modern [[Nanjing]]. Sun Quan's attempts to capture territory north of the [[Changjiang]] ended in failure both in 208 and in 215. However, when he demanded the \"return\" of Nan Commandery from Liu Bei in 215, and was denied, Sun Quan moved west and occupied the commanderies of [[Jiangxia Commandery|Jiangxia]], [[Changsha]], and [[Guiyang]].{{sfn|de Crespigny|2007|p=773-774}}\n\nIn 217 Cao Cao made a major attack on the south. Despite failing to achieve any real gains, Cao Cao stationed a substantial army in the area, threatening Sun Quan's territory forcing Sun Quan to act as a figurative subordinate to Cao Cao. In 219 Sun Quan's general [[L\u00fc Meng]] attacked [[Guan Yu]]'s position in Jing Province on advice from Sima Yi during Guan Yu's attack on Fan Castle. Guan Yu was caught off guard and killed while the whole province fell under Sun Quan's control. Liu Bei retaliated in 221 but failed to make any headway and the invasion was defeated by Sun Quan's general [[Lu Xun]]. In 226 Sun Quan launched attacks towards the south and annexed [[Jiaozhou (region)|Jiaozhou]]. In 229, Sun Quan declared himself emperor of Eastern Wu, creating the last of the Three Kingdoms.{{sfn|de Crespigny|2007|p=774}}\n\nFor the next 20 years, Sun Quan conducted several military campaigns in the north as well as an expedition to [[Taiwan]] in 230, but nothing ever came of these ventures. Noted for his longevity, Sun Quan was nevertheless unsuccessful as a military commander in comparison to his peers Liu Bei and Cao Cao. He died in 252 and was succeeded by his son [[Sun Liang]].{{sfn|de Crespigny|2007|p=774-775}}\n\n====Demise====\nAfter the death of [[Sun Quan]], the dynasty became paralyzed by infighting. [[Sun Liang]] assassinated his guardian [[Zhuge Ke]] under the influence of a distant relative [[Sun Jun (Three Kingdoms)|Sun Jun]]. When Sun Jun died in 256, he was succeeded by his cousin [[Sun Lin]]. In 258 Sun Liang sought to rid himself of his overseers but failed and was dethroned. He was replaced by [[Sun Xiu]], sixth son of Sun Quan, then 22 years old. Sun Xiu staged a coup against Sun Lin and seized power for himself. Sun Xiu died in 264 and was succeeded by [[Sun Hao]]. However, by this time he could do little to stop the might of the [[Jin dynasty (265\u2013420)|Jin dynasty]], which had just recently conquered [[Shu Han]]. Eastern Wu would itself be conquered in 280.{{sfn|de Crespigny|2004|chapter=8}}\n\n==Major warlords==\n[[File:Topographic 3K Map.jpg|thumb|400px|Late Eastern Han provinces and commanderies as well as nearby non-Chinese peoples]]\n[[File:3K Mapa.jpg|thumb|400px|Place names of the [[Three Kingdoms]]]]\n\n===Dong Zhuo, Li Jue, and Guo Si===\n[[Dong Zhuo]] and his brother [[Dong Min]] were born to [[Dong Junya]] (hailing from [[Lintao]], [[Longxi Commandery]]) in [[Yingchuan Commandery]]. As a youth, Dong Zhuo was reputed to possess immense strength and to carry two bows at each side. In 165 he became a major under [[Zhang Huan]]. For his service in defeating [[Qiang people|Qiang]] rebels, Dong Zhuo was promoted through the imperial ranks until he became Administrator of [[Hedong Commandery]] in the early 180s. In the summer of 184, Dong Zhuo was dispatched to take over overall operations against the [[Yellow Turban Rebellion]], however he was unsuccessful in this endeavor, and dismissed in the autumn. Dong Zhuo was then dispatched as a subordinate general under [[Zhang Wen (Han dynasty)|Zhang Wen]] against the [[Liang Province rebellion]]. In late 185, Dong Zhuo and [[Bao Hong]] defeated the Liang rebels at [[Meiyang]] in [[Youfufeng]] Commandery. However, when they gave chase to the rebel forces, they were surrounded and forced to fight their way out. Dong Zhuo disguised his army as fishermen to escape the enemy forces. When they passed by, Dong Zhuo had his men destroy the river dam, blocking the enemy's path, and securing their retreat. Dong Zhuo refused to obey a summons from Zhang Wen, whose staff officer [[Sun Jian]] recommended he execute Dong Zhuo. Dong Zhuo later served in the imperial army against another group of rebel forces laying siege to [[Chencang]] in Youfufeng Commandery. The commanding general [[Huangfu Song]] defeated the rebels without heeding any of the advice Dong Zhuo gave him. It was said that Dong Zhuo was arrogant and insubordinate.{{sfn|Crespigny|2007|p=158}}\n\nIn 189, [[Emperor Ling of Han]] died. General-in-Chief [[He Jin]] called on Dong Zhuo to support his elimination of the eunuchs from power. However, by the time he reached [[Luoyang]], He Jin had already been killed by the eunuchs, who were in turn killed by the guards. On 25 September, 189, Dong Zhuo took possession of the emperor [[Liu Bian]] and his brother [[Liu Xie]], establishing his puppet regime in Luoyang. On 28 September he forced Liu Bian to abdicate in favor of his brother Liu Xie. Then he killed Liu Bian a few days later. In the spring of 190 the governors in the east formed a coalition and led a [[Campaign against Dong Zhuo]]. Pressured by the enemy alliance, Dong Zhuo moved the court west to [[Chang'an]] in the summer after plundering Luoyang. In the spring of 191 Luoyang was captured by [[Yuan Shu]]'s general Sun Jian. On 22 May, 192, Dong Zhuo was killed by [[Wang Yun (Han dynasty)|Wang Yun]] and [[L\u00fc Bu]], who were soon overthrown by Dong Zhuo's former officers, [[Li Jue (Han Dynasty)|Li Jue]], [[Guo Si]] and [[Fan Chou]].{{sfn|de Crespigny|2007|p=158}}\n\nIn 194 there was a brief war with [[Ma Teng]] and [[Han Sui]] who were defeated by Guo Si and Fan Chou. In 195 Li Jue killed Fan Chou and took over his troops. Guo Si turned on Li Jue and infighting between them went on for months until a ceasefire was called. In the confusion of the conflict, the emperor was able to escape Chang'an and fled east with the help of several supporters. The emperor reached Luoyang in 196 and was then taken to [[Yingchuan Commandery]] by [[Cao Cao]]. In 197 Guo Si was killed by his officer [[Wu Xi]]. In 198 a local warlord [[Duan Wei]] killed Li Jue.{{sfn|de Crespigny|2007|p=418}}\n\n===Gongsun Du, Kang, Gong, and Yuan===\n[[Gongsun Du]] was born in Xiangping ([[Liaoyang]], [[Liaoning]]).

He rose up the ranks of officialdom in [[Ji Province]] until he became regional inspector.<ref>http://www.chinaknowledge.de/History/Han/personsgongsundu.html</ref>\n\nGongsun Du was appointed Administrator of [[Liaodong Commandery]] by [[Dong Zhuo]] in 189 on the recommendation of [[Xu Rong (general)|Xu Rong]]. As a result of his lowly origins, Du harbored an intense hatred for the elite landowning class. Once he became administrator, Du carried out his vendetta against the wealthy by publicly flogging to death the Magistrate of Xiangping and extirpating the gentry. Du dominated the northeast and expanded into the territory of [[Goguryeo]] and the [[Wuhuan]]. When Cao Cao attempted to bestow titles upon Du, he rejected them and proclaimed himself king. Du died in 204 and was succeeded by his son, [[Gongsun Kang]].{{sfn|de Crespigny|2007|p=266}}<ref>http://www.chinaknowledge.de/History/Han/personsgongsundu.html</ref> In 204 Kang expanded into Goguryeo and created [[Daifang Commandery]].

He took office as a local officer in [[Liaoxi Commandery]], where the administrator was so impressed with his appearance and booming voice that he gave his daughter to him in marriage. Later on, Zan became assistant magistrate of a county in [[Liaodong Commandery]] and made a name for himself fighting the [[Wuhuan]] and [[Xianbei]]. He was particularly known for leading a unit of mounted archers who only rode white horses. It was said that he was so well known among the Xianbei that they used his image for target practice. Despite Zan's success in halting Xianbei raids on Han territory, he was dismissed for losing a large portion of his men in an attack against numerically superior forces. Zan was eventually reappointed and given command of Wuhuan auxiliaries in 187 to deal with the [[Liang Province rebellion]]. For his service he was promoted to Commandant of Cavalry and went on to defeat the rebels [[Zhang Ju]], [[Zhang Chun]], and the Wuhuan chieftain [[Qiuliju]] in 188. However Qiuliju escaped and surrendered to the governor of [[You Province]], [[Liu Yu (warlord)|Liu Yu]]. Liu Yu was rewarded with rank and enfeoffment, making Zan resentful of him.{{sfn|de Crespigny|2007|pp=271-272}}\n\nWhen [[Dong Zhuo]] took power, he made Gongsun Zan a general in charge of Ji county in [[Guangyang Commandery]] under [[Liu Yu (warlord)|Liu Yu]], who became Grand Marshal. In 191 Zan defeated a group of [[Yellow Turbans]] moving north from the [[Shandong Peninsula]]. His cousin [[Gongsun Yue]] died in the hands of [[Yuan Shao]] while on a mission to [[Yuan Shu]], making the two enemies. He then seized a part of [[Ji Province]] but was badly defeated the next year. Recouping his losses, Zan defeated an invasion by Cui Juye and sent [[Tian Kai]] to invade [[Qing Province]], which was also defeated. In 193 a truce was arranged, but Yuan Shao's ally Liu Yu attacked Zan anyways, and was defeated and killed. In 195 insurgents led by [[Xianyu Fu]] and [[Yan Rou]] removed Zan from power with the assistance of Yuan Shao's troops. Zan retreated to Yi city where he secluded himself with his harem. He managed to repulse one attack by [[Qu Yi]] before Yuan Shao brought his main army in 198 and laid siege to the city. Zan sent his son Xu to seek aid from [[Zhang Yan (Han dynasty)|Zhang Yan]], leader of the [[Heishan bandits]]. However by the time reinforcements arrived, Yuan Shao's sappers had already breached Zan's fortifications and Zan killed himself and his family rather than surrender. Gongsun Xu was later killed by the Tuge tribe of the [[Xiongnu]].{{sfn|de Crespigny|2007|p=271, 272}}\n\n===Kong Rong===\n[[Kong Rong]] was a descendant of [[Confucius]] born in 153 to a minor government official, [[Kong Zhou]], in [[Lu Commandery]]. As the sixth child Kong Rong showed great wit and harbored aspirations beyond his age. In 169, the reformist Zhang Jian fled the court in fear of the eunuchs and sought refuge at the Kong estate. Kong Rong hid him from the authorities until he left, but they came back later and arrested Kong Rong as well as his brother Kong Bao. Kong Bao claimed responsibility, arguing that Zhang Jian initially sought his aid while his brother only acted as the agent. He was executed.{{sfn|de Crespigny|2007|p=389}}\n\nIn the late 170s, Kong Rong joined the offices of [[Yang Ci]], from which position he fought the influence of the palace eunuchs. In 184, Kong Rong sought an audience with [[He Jin]], who gave him employment in the Imperial Censorate. Kong Rong resigned from his position on grounds of disagreements with the head of the Censorate, [[Zhao She]]. Later he became General of the Household in charge of the palace guards.{{sfn|de Crespigny|2007|p=392}}\n\nWhen [[Dong Zhuo]] took power in 189, Kong Rong opposed the deposition of [[Liu Bian]]. As a result, Kong Rong was demoted and sent to deal with [[Beihai Commandery]], which was experiencing serious troubles with banditry. As Chancellor of [[Beihai Commandery]], Kong Rong sought to restore order by settling the people and building schools. However he was criticized as pretentious and ineffectual, having done little to deal with the [[Yellow Turbans]] and local bandits. In 193 he was attacked by the bandit leader [[Guan Hai]]. Kong Rong sent his subordinate [[Taishi Ci]] to seek aid from [[Liu Bei]]. Liu Bei sent a relief force and scattered the bandit army. In 196 [[Yuan Shao]]'s son [[Yuan Tan]] attacked Beihai Commandery, but Kong Rong had made no preparations, and instead spent his time in literary pursuits. When Yuan Tan captured Beihai Commandery, Kong Rong fled to [[Cao Cao]], who made him Court Architect. Kong Rong constantly demeaned Cao Cao's achievements and made fun of him but was tolerated due to his popularity at court. In 208 Kong Rong finally went too far and was killed for ridiculing Cao Cao in a self-righteous manner. His son and daughter were also executed.{{sfn|de Crespigny|2007|p=329-393}}\n\n===Liu Biao===\n[[Liu Biao]], a distant descendant of [[Emperor Jing of Han]], was born in 142 in [[Shanyang Commandery]]. As a child, he studied under the Administrator of [[Nanyang Commandery]], [[Wang Chang (Three Kingdoms)|Wang Chang]]. In the 160s, Liu Biao joined the reformist faction at the [[Taixue]] of [[Luoyang]]. As a result, he was ousted from office in 169. When the Great Proscription came to an end in 184, Liu Biao was reinstated as a clerk in the offices of General-in-Chief [[He Jin]].{{sfn|de Crespigny|2007|p=485}}\n\nIn 190, [[Sun Jian]] killed [[Wang Rui (civil servant)|Wang Rui]], the Inspector of [[Jing Province]]. Liu Biao was appointed the new Inspector of [[Jing Province]], but [[Yuan Shu]] was already in control of [[Nanyang Commandery]], so he went further south and set up base in [[Xiangyang]]. He was attacked by Sun Jian in 191, but Sun Jian died almost immediately after in a skirmish. In the late 190s a rebellion by [[Zhang Xiu (warlord)|Zhang Xiu]] disrupted Liu Biao's territory until Zhang Xiu died in 200. He gave refuge to [[Liu Bei]], who urged him to attack [[Cao Cao]] in 207, but Liu Biao declined. In 208 Liu Biao was invaded by Cao Cao in the north and [[Sun Quan]] in the south. Liu Biao died that autumn and his son [[Liu Zong]] surrendered to Cao Cao.{{sfn|de Crespigny|2007|p=538}}\n\n===Liu Yan and Liu Zhang===\n[[Liu Yan (Han dynasty warlord)|Liu Yan]] was a descendant of [[Liu Yu, Prince of Lu|Liu Yu]], the fifth son of [[Emperor Jing of Han]]. Seeking to distance himself from the turmoil at the capital, Liu Yan sought and received appointment as Governor of [[Yi Province]] in 188. He set his headquarters at [[Mianzhu]] in [[Guanghan Commandery]]. Soon after he raised troops in the name of [[Dong Zhuo]] and appointed the sect leaders [[Zhang Lu (Han Dynasty)|Zhang Lu]] and [[Zhang Xiu (warlord)|Zhang Xiu]] as officers. They were sent to attack [[Su Gu]], the Administrator of [[Hanzhong Commandery]], who defied Liu Yan. After Su Gu was defeated, Zhang Lu took Hanzhong Commandery for himself and eliminated Zhang Xiu. Liu Yan recruited troops from migrants and refugees from [[Central China]], creating a unit known as the [[Dongzhou Troops]] (\u6771\u5dde\u5175 ''dongzhoubing''). The Administrator of [[Jianwei Commandery]], [[Ren Qi]] and loyalist [[Jia Long]] attacked Liu Yan in 191, but they were defeated and killed. After moving his capital to Luo city, also in Guanghan, Liu Yan formed an alliance with [[Ma Teng]] in 194 and attacked [[Li Jue (Han Dynasty)|Li Jue]]'s regime in [[Chang'an]]. The campaign ended in failure and Liu Yan's sons Fan and Dan died in the attempt. Liu Yan died the same year after having moved his capital to [[Chengdu]] in [[Shu Commandery]], where his son [[Liu Zhang (warlord)|Liu Zhang]] succeeded him.{{sfn|de Crespigny|2007|p=572-573}}\n\nLiu Zhang put down an insurrection caused by Hu Mao, an agent of the Chang'an regime. In 200 Zhang Lu openly defied Liu Zhang, who in retaliation killed Zhang Lu's mother, who had been staying at his court as hostage. Zhang Lu invaded Liu Zhang's territory, occupying northern [[Ba Commandery]]. A follower of Liu Zhang also rebelled at this time due to grievances with the Dongzhou Troops, but he was defeated and killed. After [[Cao Cao]]'s defeat at the [[Battle of Red Cliffs]] in 208, Liu Zhang formed an alliance with [[Liu Bei]]. When Cao Cao's general [[Zhong Yao]] was sent against Zhang Lu in 211, Liu Zhang invited Liu Bei to Guanghan hoping that someone from the same imperial clan would help him. Liu Bei spent the next year complaining about the lack of supplies, then turned on Liu Zhang, killed his officers, and waged war on him. By 214 Liu Bei's forces had advanced to Chengdu, where a siege lasting several weeks occurred before Liu Zhang surrendered. Liu Zhang was exiled to [[Jing Province]] where he eventually entered the court of [[Sun Quan]] when his general [[L\u00fc Meng]] defeated [[Guan Yu]] in 219.{{sfn|de Crespigny|2007|p=588}}\n\n===L\u00fc Bu===\n[[File:5.3ktallhorse.jpg|thumb|Bronze horse (5.3 foot tall) from Three Kingdoms era tomb]]\n{{quotation|L\u00fc Bu was skilled in horse archery, possessing strength surpassing others, and was called the Flying General...

L\u00fc Bu was also defeated and driven from Luoyang. Conflict between Dong Zhuo and L\u00fc Bu soon came to a head and in 192 L\u00fc Bu conspired with [[Wang Yun (Han dynasty)|Wang Yun]] to kill Dong Zhuo. After ambushing and killing Dong Zhuo, Wang Yun's government was toppled by [[Li Jue (Han Dynasty)|Li Jue]] in less than a month and L\u00fc Bu was forced to flee to [[Yuan Shu]] but was turned away because of the unruly behavior of his men. Next L\u00fc Bu visited [[Zhang Yang (warlord)|Zhang Yang]] and then left when Li Jue offered a price for his head. In 193 he participated in [[Yuan Shao]]'s campaign against the [[Black Mountain bandits]]. Once again the brutality of his men caused upset and Yuan Shao sent L\u00fc Bu back to Luoyang while ordering the escort to kill L\u00fc Bu. L\u00fc Bu managed to avoid assassination and fled. In 194 L\u00fc Bu joined [[Zhang Chao]] and [[Zhang Miao]]'s rebellion against [[Cao Cao]] in [[Yan Province]]. While initially successful, the rebel forces failed to take [[Puyang]] in [[Dong Commandery]], and the tide turned against them. By the summer of 195 L\u00fc Bu was forced to flee again, this time to [[Liu Bei]] in [[Xu Province]]. In 196 Yuan Shu attacked Liu Bei. L\u00fc Bu switched sides, capturing Liu Bei's assets in [[Xiapi Commandery]], and taking his surrender. After defeating Liu Bei, L\u00fc Bu turned on Yuan Shu and drove back his army. The defeated Liu Bei later fled to Cao Cao, who in 198 sent [[Xiahou Dun]] to assist Liu Bei against L\u00fc Bu. L\u00fc Bu was unable to coordinate his commanders, who acted separately, and was driven back to Xiapi Commandery where his officers eventually betrayed him, opening the gates for the opposing army.

Shi Xie was well disposed towards the northern warlords and acquiesced to [[Sun Quan]]'s chosen Inspector of Jiaozhi, [[Bu Zhi]], who visited [[Nanhai Commandery]] in 211. Shi Xie then sent his son Xin to Sun Quan as hostage in 217. Reduced to only [[Jiaozhi Commandery]], Shi Xie died in 226 at the age of 90. His son [[Shi Hui (Three Kingdoms)|Shi Hui]] was given the post of prefect in [[Jiuzhen Commandery]] while Chen Shi became prefect of Jiaozhi Commandery. At this point Sun Quan's agent, [[L\u00fc Dai]], decided to split Jiaozhou in half with the northern portion ([[Guangzhou]]) assigned to himself and the southern half, the new Jiaozhou, to [[Dai Liang]]. Shi Hui refused to let Dai Liang into the province and decided to rebel. His officials opposed him in rebelling against Sun Quan and laid siege to him in his capital, however they were unable to breach the city gates and were eventually forced to make peace. L\u00fc Dai contacted Shi Hui's cousin and sent him with an offer of clemency on the condition that Shi Hui surrender peacefully.

The exact circumstances of Yuan Shao's  birth and lineage are not clear but it's said that he was the son of Yuan Feng by a concubine, who then chose to adopt the lineage of his uncle [[Yuan Cheng]] (who lacked an heir). This was a source of contention between Shao and his half brother [[Yuan Shu]], who was the son of Feng and his chief wife, making him senior to Shao within the Feng family. However, because Shao was adopted into the family of Feng's elder brother Cheng, he became the senior cousin, and higher up in the Yuan hierarchy than Shu. Envious of Shao's greater prestige and popularity, Shu referred to him as \"our family slave\" and claimed that Shao was not a true member of the Yuan clan.{{sfn|de Crespigny|2007|p=1009-1010}}\n\nYuan Shao grew to be a handsome young man and a popular leader among his peers in [[Luoyang]]. At some point, he and [[Cao Cao]] raided a wedding, but after Cao Cao kidnapped the bride, he directed the pursuers to Shao. In the late 160s, Shao, then in his 20s, aided the reformist faction in escaping persecution by the eunuchs. After that he received appointment as a county magistrate in [[Dong Commandery]]. He then left office for six years to mourn the death of his adoptive mother and father. Upon returning to Luoyang, Shao entered the service of the Imperial Censorate, and rose through the ranks until he became a colonel in the imperial corps of the Western Garden by 188.{{sfn|de Crespigny|2007|p=1010}}\n\nFollowing the death of [[Emperor Ling of Han]] in 189, Yuan Shao urged [[He Jin]] to destroy the eunuchs. When He Jin was killed, Shao led a massacre of the eunuchs. After [[Dong Zhuo]] came to power, Shao fled east and formed a coalition army to embark on a [[Campaign against Dong Zhuo]]. Based in [[Suanzao]] in [[Chenliu Commandery]], the coalition army met with little success throughout 190, so in 191 Shao took over [[Ji Province]] from [[Han Fu (warlord)|Han Fu]]. When the coalition dissolved, Shao sent men against Yuan Shu's officer [[Sun Jian]] in [[Yingchuan Commandery]]. [[Gongsun Zan]] attacked Shao but was defeated at [[Battle of Jie Bridge|Jie Bridge]] between [[Julu Commandery|Julu]] and [[Qinghe County, Hebei|Qinghe]] commanderies. Shao set his capital at the city of [[Ye (Hebei)]] in [[Wei Commandery]]. In 193 Shao attacked the [[Black Mountain bandits]] and forced them into hiding. In 195, [[Zang Hong]] rebelled against Shao but was defeated and sentenced to death. Shao's follower Chen Rong criticized him of dishonorable conduct and was executed as well.{{sfn|Crespigny|2007|p=75}} With the support of the [[Wuhuan]], he made the final attack on Gongsun Zan in 198 and eliminated him the beginning of next year. In 199 Shao became hostile to Cao Cao and moved against him. His army moved too slow however and in early winter of 200, Cao Cao destroyed two of his supply trains at the [[Battle of Guandu]]. His army scattered and fled. Shao became ill and died in 202. He was succeeded by his son [[Yuan Shang]].{{sfn|de Crespigny|2007|p=1011}}\n\nCao Cao attacked in the autumn. By the summer of 203 Yuan Shang had been defeated and driven back to Ye, however Cao Cao decided to withdraw at this point. Shang came into open conflict with his brother [[Yuan Tan]], who fled east. In 204 Shang besieged his brother at [[Pingyuan Commandery]] but Cao Cao moved against him at Ye and forced him to flee to [[Zhongshan Commandery]] where Tan attacked him. Shang fled again to his other brother [[Yuan Xi]] in [[You Province]] while Cao Cao attacked Tan at [[Nanpi]] in [[Bohai Commandery]] and killed him. In 205 Shang and Xi were ejected from their territory by mutineers and fled to the [[Wuhuan]] under [[Tadun]], but Tadun was defeated by Cao Cao at the [[Battle of White Wolf Mountain]] in 207. They fled for the last time, this time to [[Gongsun Kang]], who killed them and sent their heads to Cao Cao.{{sfn|de Crespigny|2007|p=1009}}\n\n===Yuan Shu===\n[[Yuan Shu]] was born to a highly distinguished official family who had held office as one of the [[Three Ducal Ministers]], the three highest posts below emperor, for three generations.

When [[Dong Zhuo]] took over, Yuan Shu fled to [[Nanyang Commandery]]. His army took part in the [[Campaign against Dong Zhuo]] under [[Sun Jian]]'s command, but when Sun Jian returned from [[Luoyang]], Yuan Shao became hostile and sent [[Zhou Ang]] against him. Yuan Shu allied with [[Gongsun Zan]] while his half brother allied with [[Liu Biao]]. Sun Jian soon died in a skirmish while on campaign against Liu Biao so Yuan Shu withdrew east to [[Chenliu Commandery]] where he was driven away as well by [[Cao Cao]] in 193. He then retreated to [[Shouchun]] in [[Jiujiang Commandery]]. The next year Yuan Shu sent [[Wu Jing (Han dynasty)|Wu Jing]] against Governor of [[Yang Province]], [[Liu Yao]], with the extra help of [[Sun Ce]] in 195. In 196 Yuan Shu defeated [[Liu Bei]] in [[Xu Province]] with the aid of [[L\u00fc Bu]], who then changed sides and forced Yuan Shu's forces back to Shouchun. In 197 Yuan Shu declared himself emperor of the Zhong dynasty, which made everybody hate him. Sun Ce abandoned him while [[Cao Cao]] seized territory north of the [[Huai River]]. His fledgling dynasty was left in ruin and in 199 Yuan Shu attempted to escape to [[Qing Province]], but was driven back to Shouchun, where he died outside the city.{{sfn|de Crespigny|2007|p=1012}} His family fled to [[Liu Xun (warlord)|Liu Xun]], Administrator of [[Lujiang Commandery]].

Zhang Lu and Zhang Xiu killed Su Gu and took the territory for themselves. Zhang Lu killed Zhang Xiu and established a theocracy with religious [[Libationers]] as the primary civil authority. He preached confession of sins and the use of charms to cure illness. Minor wrongdoers were forced to become public servants who provided refreshments for travelers on the road. Alcohol was banned. In 200 Zhang Lu moved against [[Liu Zhang (warlord)|Liu Zhang]] and seized northern [[Ba Commandery]]. His mother, who had been kept as a captive by Liu Zhang, was killed. In 214 Zhang Lu provided [[Ma Chao]] with some troops but when Ma Chao asked for more, he refused, after which Ma Chao turned to [[Liu Bei]]. In 215 [[Cao Cao]] attacked Zhang Lu. After his brother Zhang Wei was defeated, Zhang Lu fled to the Zong and Banshun natives for protection but they surrendered to Cao Cao and Zhang Lu was forced to submit as well. Cao Cao treated him well and his family was given honored positions at court.

Zhang Yang tried to seize Shangdang Commandery for himself. While he failed to oust the commandery's Administrator, he  managed to gather several thousand followers while plundering the local counties. When the coalition against [[Dong Zhuo]] formed, he attempted to join it, but his partner the wandering Xiongnu mercenary [[Yufuluo]] forced him to attack [[Yuan Shao]] instead. They were defeated at the city of [[Ye (Hebei)|Ye]]. After that Zhang Yang received commission from Dong Zhuo as Administrator of [[Henei Commandery]], so he based himself at Yewang across the [[Yellow River]] from [[Luoyang]]. In 192 and 193 he gave refuge to [[L\u00fc Bu]]. When [[Cao Cao]] attacked L\u00fc Bu at [[Xiapi]] in 198, Zhang Yang attempted to strike Cao Cao from the rear, but was killed by his own officer [[Yang Chou]], who held a grudge against L\u00fc Bu. After he defected to Cao Cao, Yang Chou was in turn killed by another officer Sui Gu who then attempted to seek help from Yuan Shao. He was defeated the following year by Cao Cao's officers [[Shi Huan]] and [[Cao Ren]]{{sfn|de Crespigny|2007|p=1084}}{{sfn|de Crespigny|2007|p=762}}\n\n==Minor warlords==\n===Gao Gan===\nBorn to [[Gao Gong]] in [[Chenliu Commandery]], [[Gao Gan]] was a nephew of [[Yuan Shao]].

In 202, Gao Gan joined the [[Southern Xiongnu]] chanyu [[Huchuquan]] in attacking [[Hedong Commandery]]. They were defeated and Huchuquan surrendered to [[Cao Cao]]'s officer [[Zhong Yao]]. Gao Gan surrendered to Cao Cao in 204 but felt unsatisfied with his new position as Inspector of Bing Province. In 205, Gao Gao seized [[Shangdang Commandery]] and invaded Hedong Commandery. Gao Gan failed to take [[Ye (Hebei)|Ye]] and was driven back. In 206, Cao Cao personally led an attack on Gao Gao, forcing him to flee to the Xiongnu and then to the south in [[Jing Province]], where he was captured and killed.{{sfn|de Crespigny|2007|p=241}}\n\n===Han Fu===\n[[Han Fu (warlord)|Han Fu]] was appointed Governor of [[Ji Province]] in 189. While he nominally participated in the [[Campaign against Dong Zhuo]], he stayed at the city of [[Ye (Hebei)|Ye]]. After the coalition broke up, he became hostile to [[Yuan Shao]] in 191 and denied him supplies. Using his family connections, Yuan Shao intimidated Han Fu into handing over his position to him. After doing so, Han Fu's family was constantly harassed until they fled to [[Zhang Miao]]. He eventually killed himself.{{sfn|de Crespigny|2007|p=296}}\n\n===Liu Chong===\n[[Liu Chong (Prince Min of Chen)|Liu Chong]], otherwise known as Prince Min of [[Chen Commandery|Chen]], was the son of Liu Cheng. In 173, Liu Chong and former Chancellor Wei Yin offered sacrifices to [[Huang\u2013Lao]] for good fortune, but the practice was seen as reprehensible by the senior officials. The official Shi Qian accused Wei Yin and Liu Chong of impiety. An official inquiry was carried out which resulted in the arrest of both Shi Qian and Wei Yin. They were both executed and no further investigation of Liu Chong occurred. Liu Chong was said to be a fine shot with the crossbow and had written a treatise on the weapon called the ''Nushe bifa''. When the [[Yellow Turban Rebellion]] broke out in 184, he raised several thousand archers and brought them to the capital where his presence quelled any unrest. In 190, he formed an alliance with [[Dong Zhuo]] and styled himself General Who Supports Han while his Chancellor Luo Jun maintained his territory in Chen Commandery. When [[Yuan Shu]]'s request for supplies was denied by Luo Jun in 197, he sent assassins who killed both Luo Jun and Liu Chong.{{sfn|de Crespigny|2007|p=494}}\n\n===Liu Yao===\n[[Liu Yao (warlord)|Liu Yao]], son of Liu Yu and nephew of [[Liu Chong (Prince Min of Chen)|Liu Chong]], was born in 157 in [[Donglai Commandery]]. At the age of 18 he saved his uncle Liu Wei from a kidnapping.

It was said that his virtue protected the county from a plague of locusts. He was promoted to Inspector of [[You Province]], where he wore the local clothing of fur and felt. His government was praised by the people and he received regular tribute from the non-Chinese. In 184, he was sent as Chancellor to [[Ganling]], where his record of humane rule settled the hotbed of [[Yellow Turban]] discontent. In 188, he was sent back to [[You Province]]. As Governor, he persuaded the [[Wuhuan]] chieftain [[Qiuliju]] to surrender and murdered the rebel [[Zhang Chun]]. [[Yuan Shao]] suggested that he be made regent instead of [[Dong Zhuo]] or even take the throne for himself, but Liu Yu declined. Under Liu Yu's governorship, You Province prospered as a result of policies encouraging silk production, market trading, and production of salt and iron. The province's prosperity and low grain prices attracted many southern refugees. In 191 Liu Yu allied with Yuan Shao, and [[Gongsun Zan]] with [[Yuan Shu]]. In 193 Liu Yu attempted to oust Gongsun Zan, who had built a fortified camp within the walls of his capital in [[Guangyang Commandery]], but failed. Gongsun Zan counterattacked, driving him from the city.

He served as an officer under the Administrator Li Su, who was later executed for his cowardice. Lu Kang escorted the Administrator's body home to carry out a full mourning, for which he gained a reputation for loyalty. He went on to become a magistrate in [[Bohai Commandery]] and ended the military levy there and governed the territory through honest and generous government. In 185, Lu Kang protested the extravagance and corruption involved in the rebuilding of palaces in [[Luoyang]] and as a result was dismissed for a time before he became a consultant at the capital. In 188, he became Administrator of [[Lujiang Commandery]] in 188. He put down the rebel chieftain Huang Rang and continued to send reports and tribute to the capital even as the Han dynasty fell apart.

In 193 he entered a loose alliance with [[Yuan Shu]] and [[Gongsun Zan]], but that winter Tao Qian's soldiers killed [[Cao Song]], [[Cao Cao]]'s father. In retaliation Cao Cao brought the full force of his army down on him, ravaging [[Pengcheng]] and [[Xiapi]] commanderies.

In 210 Zhang Meng was defeated by [[Han Sui]].{{sfn|de Crespigny|2007|p=691}}\n\n===Zhu Jun===\n[[Zhu Jun (Han dynasty)|Zhu Jun]]'s father died when he was very young. His mother raised him working as a silk seller. After working as a clerk in his local county office, Zhu Jun joined the commandery staff, where he spent almost 20 years before becoming Registrar to the Adminsitrator Yin Duan. In 173, Yin Duan was reported by provincial authorities for failing to defeat the rebel Xu Chang, but Zhu Jun intercepted the letter, resulting in a reduced sentence for Yin Duan. Zhu Jun went on to become a magistrate in [[Donghai Commandery]] before he was sent to [[Jiaozhi]] in 181 as Inspector to deal with a rebellion by Liang Long. He raised 5,000 troops from his home in [[Kuaiji Commandery]] and defeated the rebellion within a matter of weeks. Zhu Jun was recalled to the capital and promoted to Counsellor Remonstrant. In 184, Zhu Jun and [[Huangfu Song]] were sent to deal with the [[Yellow Turban Rebellion]] in the south. They experienced some setbacks but managed to pacify [[Yingchuan Commandery|Yingchuan]], [[Runan Commandery|Runan]], and [[Chen Commandery|Chen]] commanderies by autumn. Zhu Jun then moved to [[Nanyang Commandery]] and defeated the rebels there through deception. In 185, he was promoted again but left office when his mother died.

In the following year, he was defeated by Dong Zhuo's commanders [[Guo Si]] and [[Li Jue (Han dynasty)|Li Jue]]. He returned to the imperial court after Dong Zhuo's assassination and served until 195 when he was taken captive by Guo Si, who had by then broken out in open conflict with Li Jue.

His father held appointment at the capital and in 178, Han Sui followed in his father's footsteps by becoming a Reporting Officer at [[Luoyang]]. During his stay at the capital, he became friends with [[Cao Cao]], and was instrumental in urging General-in-Chief [[He Jin]] to eliminate the eunuchs. However He Jin was reluctant and after some time Han Sui returned to his homeland in the west, where he became Assistant Officer of [[Liang Province]].{{sfn|de Crespigny|2007|p=301}}\n\nIn 184, Han Sui and his colleague [[Bian Zhang]] joined [[Beigong Boyu]] in the [[Liang Province rebellion]].

They failed to take Chang'an again in 189. Wang Guo was deposed and the rebel forces split up into three groups: Han Sui in Jincheng Commandery, [[Ma Teng]] in [[Longxi Commandery]], and [[Song Jian]] on the upper [[Yellow River]]. He initially supported [[Dong Zhuo]] and his successor [[Li Jue (Han Dynasty)|Li Jue]], but turned on them in 194 when he joined Ma Teng in attacking Chang'an. They were defeated at [[Changping Slope]] northwest of Chang'an and Han Sui was forced to withdraw to [[Youfufeng Commandery]]. Han Sui fell out with Ma Teng, possibly due to the machinations of Cao Cao's agent [[Zhong Yao]], and they began to skirmish with Ma Teng taking the heavier losses, causing him to join [[Cao Cao]]. In 210 Han Sui defeated [[Zhang Meng (warlord)|Zhang Meng]] in [[Wuwei Commandery]]. In 211 Cao Cao sent troops against [[Zhang Lu (Han Dynasty)|Zhang Lu]]. Believing that this was a preliminary attack on themselves, Han Sui and [[Ma Chao]] forged an alliance and confronted the enemy troops with initial success, driving them away. Later, Cao Cao personally led an army against the western alliance. When the three armies met at [[Huayin]], Han Sui attempted to negotiate with Cao Cao and talked of the old days when they were friends at Luoyang, but Cao Cao's replies were mixed. The two sides agreed on a day to do battle. Han Sui and Ma Chao were defeated and forced to retreat. In 214 [[Xiahou Yuan]] drove Han Sui from [[Hanyang Commandery]].

Ma Teng then joined the mutineers, styling himself a general under the command of [[Wang Guo]]. After Wang Guo was defeated in 189, Ma Teng set himself up as an independent ruler in [[Longxi Commandery]]. When [[Dong Zhuo]] retreated to [[Chang'an]], he persuaded Ma Teng and [[Han Sui]] to assist him against the other warlords. Ma Teng continued his allegiance to the Chang'an regime for a time even after Dong Zhuo's death and usurpation by [[Li Jue (Han Dynasty)|Li Jue]]. In 194, he betrayed Li Jue and attacked Chang'an with the aid of Han Sui and supporters in [[Luoyang]]. Ma Teng and Han Sui were defeated at [[Changping Slope]] northwest of Chang'an and he retreated to [[Liang Province]]. Around 197 Ma Teng began to quarrel with Han Sui and their forces engaged in battle with Ma Teng losing the exchange. His son [[Ma Chao]] was wounded in battle by [[Yan Xing (Han dynasty)|Yan Xing]] while his wife and other sons were also lost, forcing him to retreat to [[Youfufeng Commandery]]. He threw in his lot with [[Cao Cao]] in 202, sending Ma Chao to fight [[Yuan Shao]]'s officer [[Guo Yuan (Yuan Shang's subordinate)|Guo Yuan]] in [[Hedong Commandery]], and in 205 he himself campaigned against [[Sun Quan]]'s officer [[Zhang Cheng (Three Kingdoms)|Zhang Cheng]]. In 208 Ma Teng was enfeoffed but kept hostage in [[Ye (Hebei)|Ye]] while his son Ma Chao succeeded him in Liang Province. In 211 Ma Chao and Han Sui became hostile to Cao Cao.

He then seized [[Hanyang Commandery]]. In the autumn an uprising by [[Yang Fu]] and [[Jiang Xu]] defeated Ma Chao and forced him to take refuge with Zhang Lu. Zhang Lu provided Ma Chao with troops to make an attempt to re-establish himself in Liang Province, but Ma Chao was defeated by [[Xiahou Yuan]]. Realizing that Zhang Lu would not provide him with any more troops, Ma Chao joined [[Liu Bei]], who made him a general.

Gan Ning aided Hu Mao in his conflict with Liu Zhang but they were defeated. Gan Ning fled with 800 followers to [[Liu Biao]] and then [[Huang Zu]], who treated him with disdain due to his past history as a bandit. At the [[Battle of Xiakou]] in 203, Huang Zu's fleet was defeated in an attack by [[Sun Quan]], and he himself was nearly captured until Gan Ning killed the enemy general, [[Ling Cao]], with an arrow. Despite being saved by Gan Ning, Huang Zu continued to treat his savior coldly and refused to bestow upon him any rewards or promotions. He even tried to induce Gang Ning's men to abandon him.{{sfn|de Crespigny|2007|p=239}}\n\nIn 207, Gan Ning was assigned to an eastern border post with the help of a sympathetic officer, [[Su Fei]].

Gan Ning participated in several following campaigns, notably at the [[Battle of Yiling (208)|Battle of Yiling]] where he held off [[Cao Ren]]'s forces long enough for reinforcements to arrive despite being outnumbered five to one. In 215, he maintained the rearguard when Sun Quan was defeated at the [[Battle of Xiaoyao Ford]], saving his lord's life.

When [[Sun Ce]] came to [[Wu Commandery]] in 195, Yan Baihu gave refuge to the displaced [[Xu Gong]] and threatened the flank of Sun Ce's army. However Sun Ce paid him no attention and the two avoided any altercations. In 197, [[Cao Cao]]'s agent Chen Yu provoked Yan into rebellion. Sun Ce sent [[L\u00fc Fan]] to drive out Chen Yu while he himself attacked Yan. The defeated Yan fled south to join [[Xu Zhao]] but died soon afterwards. Remnants of Yan's band joined Xu Gong in 200 to threaten Sun Ce's rear as he attacked [[Huang Zu]] in the west. Sun Ce decided to retreat and finish off the bandits once and for all, only to fall into an ambush and die at their hands.{{sfn|de Crespigny|2007|p=938}}\n\n===Yang Feng===\n[[Yang Feng]] was a leader of the Bobo bandit group in [[Xihe Commandery]]. He joined [[Li Jue (Han Dynasty)|Li Jue]] but rebelled against him in 195. In 196 Yang Feng aided [[Emperor Xian of Han]] in escaping the capital. [[Dong Zhao (Three Kingdoms)|Dong Zhao]] approached Yang Feng on behalf of [[Cao Cao]] and convinced him to let the emperor travel to [[Xu city]]. Later Yang Feng tried to interfere in the move and was defeated by Cao Cao in battle, after which he fled to [[Yuan Shu]]. In 197 Yang Feng rebelled against Yuan Shu in support of [[L\u00fc Bu]], however L\u00fc Bu did not come to his aid and Yang Feng was forced to flee to [[Liu Bei]]. Liu Bei invited him to a banquet, at which he was bound and killed.{{sfn|de Crespigny|2007|p=949}}\n\n===Zhang Yan===\n[[Zhang Yan (Han dynasty)|Zhang Yan]], originally Chu Yan, was the leader of a bandit group in the [[Taihang Mountains]] in 184. At some point he joined another bandit, Oxhorn Zhang, but Zhang was fatally wounded in a raid and died soon afterwards. His last act was to transfer his men over to Chu Yan, who took the name of Zhang to honor his patron. Zhang Yan went on to create a bandit confederacy known as the [[Black Mountain bandits]] that ravaged the neighboring commanderies of [[Changshan Commandery|Changshan]], [[Zhao Commandery|Zhao]], [[Zhongshan Commandery|Zhongshan]], [[Shangdang Commandery|Shangdang]], and [[Henei Commandery|Henei]]. In 190 Zhang Yan had a loose alliance with [[Gongsun Zan]] against [[Yuan Shao]]. In 193 Yuan Shao attacked the Black Mountain bandits, forcing them off the southern hills and into the mountains. When Yuan Shao made his final attack on Gongsun Zan in 199, Zhang Yan tried to save him but failed. Zhang Yan surrendered to [[Cao Cao]] when he took over [[Ji Province]] in 205. He was made a general as well as a marquis.{{sfn|de Crespigny|2007|p=1083}}\n\n===Zheng Jiang===\nA woman bandit active in [[Dongping Commandery]] about 210. Apparently her appearance was foretold in a dream of Liu Zhen, one of [[Cao Cao]]'s staff, where she was represented by a snake with four legs. She was defeated soon after. It is not clear in the text if she was a single person or two women named Zheng and Jiang.{{sfn|de Crespigny|2007|p=1123}}\n\n===Zu Lang===\n[[Zu Lang]] was a local leader who defeated [[Sun Ce]] in a skirmish in 194 and then driven into the southern hills by [[Wu Jing (Han dynasty)|Wu Jing]], Sun Ce's maternal uncle. He was eventually captured but Sun Ce showed him no ill will and recruited him into his staff.{{sfn|de Crespigny|2007|p=1179}}\n\n==Yellow Turbans==\nZhang Rao, Guan Hai, He Man, He Yi, Huang Shao, Liu Pi, Xu He, and Sima Ju were leaders of the [[Yellow Turbans]] during the early 190s. They had substantial followings numbering in the tens of thousands. \n\nIn 192, Zhang Rao defeated [[Kong Rong]]'s forces.{{sfn|de Crespigny|2007|p=1073}}\n\nIn 193, Guan Hai besieged Kong Rong but was defeated by [[Liu Bei]].{{sfn|de Crespigny|2007|p=318}}\n\nIn 196, [[Cao Cao]] took to the field against the other Yellow Turbans and defeated Huang Shao, after which He Man and He Yi surrendered.{{sfn|de Crespigny|2007|p=348}}\n\nIn 200, Liu Pi supported [[Yuan Shao]]'s invasion from the north by plundering the region around Cao Cao's headquarters at [[Xu city]]. He was later joined by [[Liu Bei]], whom Yuan Shao sent to assist him, but they were defeated by [[Cao Ren]]. Liu Pi was killed.{{sfn|de Crespigny|2007|p=536}}\n\nIn 206, Sima Ju and Xu He attacked a number of cities in [[Qing Province]]. [[Cao Cao]] sent [[Xiahou Yuan]], [[Zang Ba]], and [[L\u00fc Qian]] with a large force to deal with them. After several engagements and heavy casualties on both sides, the two Yellow Turban rebels were killed.{{sfn|de Crespigny|2007|p=747}}\n\n==Non-Chinese actors==\n[[File:Zhuge Liang's Southern Campaign.png|320px|thumb|[[Zhuge Liang's Southern Campaign]]]]\n\n===Banshun and Zong===\n{{main|Bandun Man}}\nThe Banshun, also known as the [[Bandun Man]], which literally means \"board shield barbarians\", were a native people of [[Ba Commandery]], [[Yi Province]], who often served as elite troops in the Han army against other peoples such as the [[Qiang (historical people)|Qiang]] and the natives of [[Wuling Commandery]]. They rebelled in 179 due to unrest caused by the [[Yellow Turban Rebellion]], but when amnesty was issued by [[Cao Qian]] in 182, the rebellion was ended.{{sfn|de Crespigny|2007|p=46}} There was another brief uprising in 188 but it amounted to nothing.{{sfn|de Crespigny|2007|p=515}} Related to the Banshun were the neighboring Zong people, who became interested in the mysticism of the [[Way of the Celestial Masters|Celestial Master]] [[Zhang Lu (Han dynasty)|Zhang Lu]] and moved north to the border of his territory. When [[Cao Cao]] attacked Zhang Lu in the summer of 215, he fled to [[Duhu (town)|Duhu]] of the Zong and [[Fuhu]] of the Banshun for refuge. However Duhu and Fuhu surrendered to Cao Cao in the autumn and received appointment, with Zhang Lu following in the winter. In 219 [[Liu Bei]]'s officer [[Huang Quan (general)|Huang Quan]] attacked them and drove several non-Chinese groups north into Cao Cao's territory.{{sfn|de Crespigny|2007|p=191}} The Zong therefore became known as the [[Di (Five Barbarians)|Di people]] from Ba.{{sfn|de Crespigny|2007|p=416}}\n\n===Champa===\nThe [[Cham people]] in [[T\u01b0\u1ee3ng L\u00e2m|Xianglin]], the southernmost district of [[Rinan Commandery]], broke away and became the Kingdom of [[L\u00e2m \u1ea4p]] ([[Champa]]) in 192.{{sfn|Taylor|1983|p=47}}\n\nIn 248, L\u00e2m \u1ea4p seized Rinan Commandery.

In 213, the Di kings Agui and Qianwan entered an alliance with [[Ma Chao]]. The next year [[Xiahou Yuan]] attacked their camp in [[Wudu Commandery]] and defeated them, killing Agui and forcing Qianwan to flee. Their people were resettled in [[Youfufeng Commandery]].

The Wei general [[Guanqiu Jian]] took the capital of [[Gungnae]]. The invasions, a retaliation against a Goguryeo raid in 242, destroyed the Goguryeo capital of [[Hwando]], sent its king fleeing, and broke the tributary relationships between Goguryeo and the other tribes of Korea that formed much of Goguryeo's economy. Although the king evaded capture and eventually settled in a new capital, Goguryeo was reduced to such insignificance that for half a century there was no mention of the state in Chinese historical texts.<ref name=\"byington93\">Byington, Mark E.

He caused trouble again in 223 and was killed in [[Zhuge Liang's Southern Campaign]] two years later.{{sfn|de Crespigny|2007|p=246}}\n\n====Meng Huo====\n[[Meng Huo]] was a local leader of the [[Nanman]] mentioned in ''[[Annotations to Records of the Three Kingdoms]]'' by [[Pei Songzhi]]. In 225, Meng Huo rebelled with [[Yong Kai]]. He was captured by [[Zhuge Liang]] seven times before he surrendered. Meng Huo's role was greatly expanded upon in ''[[Romance of the Three Kingdoms]]'', in which he is portrayed as the king of the Nanman and husband to [[Lady Zhurong]], a descendant of the God of Fire. In the ''Romance'', Meng Huo was described riding a red horse, wearing a golden inlaid headdress, a belt with a clasp in the image of a lion\u2019s face, boots with pointed toes that were green, and a pair of swords chased with pine amber at his waist. Later he rode into battle on a red ox, wearing rhinoceros armour while wielding shield and sword. He enlisted the aid of his fellow kings Wutugu, who commanded an army of 30,000 invincible rattan armour troops, and Mulu, who rode a white elephant and deployed wild beasts in battle. Although his allies were defeated by Zhuge Liang's anachronistic gunpowder weapons and killed, Meng Huo was repeatedly captured and released until he surrendered and became a local administrator.{{sfn|Besio|2007|p=57}}\n\n====Yong Kai====\n[[Yong Kai]] was a powerful chieftain in [[Yizhou Commandery]]. In 215, Yong Kai killed the Administrator [[Zheng Ang]] and defected to [[Sun Quan]]. Sun Quan named Yong Kai Administrator of [[Yongchang Commandery]] but actually distrusted him and ordered his officers to keep him out of that territory. In 223, Yong Kai captured the Administrator [[Zhang Yi (Junsi)|Zhang Yi]] and sent him to Sun Quan. In 225, Yong Kai was killed by another chieftain, [[Gao Ding]].{{sfn|de Crespigny|2007|p=989}}\n\n===Shanyue===\nThe [[Shanyue]] \"Mountain Yue\" were a group of [[Austro-Asiatic]] people related to the [[Vietnamese people|Vietnamese]] who lived in the mountain regions of modern [[Jiangsu]], [[Zhejiang]], [[Anhui]], [[Jiangxi]] and [[Fujian]]. In 203, they rebelled against [[Sun Quan]]'s rule and were defeated by the generals [[L\u00fc Fan]], [[Cheng Pu]], and [[Taishi Ci]]. In 217, Sun Quan appointed [[Lu Xun]] supreme commander of an army to suppress martial activities by the Shanyue in Guiji (modern [[Shaoxing]]). Captured Shanyue tribesmen were recruited into the army. In 234, [[Zhuge Ke]] was made governor of [[Danyang, Jiangsu|Danyang]]. Under his governorship, the region was cleansed of the Shanyue through systematic destruction of their settlements. Captured tribesmen were used as front line fodder in the army. The remaining population was resettled in lowlands and many became tenant farmers for Chinese landowners.<ref>http://www.chinaknowledge.de/History/Altera/yue.html</ref>\n\n===Vietnam===\nThe Three Kingdoms era was a formative period in [[Vietnamese history]]. The ruler of [[Jiaozhou (region)|Jiaozhou]] (modern [[Vietnam]] and [[Guangzhou]]), [[Shi Xie]], is primarily remembered today in [[Vietnam]] as [[S\u0129 Nhi\u1ebfp]], the father of education and a great patron of [[Buddhism]].

The Vietnamese initially opposed Shi Hui's rebellion against Eastern Wu and even attacked him for it. However, when the Wu general [[L\u00fc Dai]] betrayed Shi Hui and executed the entire Shi family, the Vietnamese became greatly upset. In 248, the people of [[Jiaozhi]] and [[Jiuzhen]] commanderies rebelled. Eastern Wu sent [[Lu Yin (Three Kingdoms)|Lu Yin]] to deal with the rebels. He managed to pacify the rebels with a combination of threats and persuasion. However the rebels regrouped under the leadership of [[Lady Tri\u1ec7u]] in Jiuzhen and renewed the rebellion with a march on Jiaozhi.

After several months of warfare she was defeated and killed.{{sfn|Taylor|1983|p=70}}\n\n===Wuhuan===\nThe [[Wuhuan]], a people similar to the [[Xianbei]], were a loose confederation of nomads that had been subservient to larger and stronger neighboring powers for most of their existence. In 168 the Wuhuan established some degree of independence under their own leaders. The largest of these groups were led by [[Nanlou]] in Shanggu, [[Qiuliju]] in Liaoxi, [[Supuyan]] in the Dependent State of Liaodong, and [[Wuyan]] in Youbeiping.{{sfn|de Crespigny|2010|p=229}} In 187 Qiuliju joined the rebellion of Zhang Chun.

By 190, the Xianbei had split into three groups with Kuitou ruling in [[Inner Mongolia]], [[Kebineng]] (\u8efb\u6bd4\u80fd) in northern [[Shanxi]], and Suli (\u7d20\u5229) and Mijia in northern [[Liaodong]]. In 205, Kuitou's brothers [[Budugen]] and Fuluohan succeeded him. After Cao Cao defeated the [[Wuhuan]] at the [[Battle of White Wolf Mountain]] in 207, Budugen and Fuluohan paid tribute to him. In 218, Fuluohan met with the Wuhuan chieftain Nengchendi to form an alliance, but Nengchendi double crossed him and called in another Xianbei khan, Kebineng, who killed Fuluohan.{{sfn|de Crespigny|2007|p=237}} Budugen went to the court of [[Cao Wei]] in 224 to ask for assistance against Kebineng, but he eventually betrayed them and allied with Kebineng in 233.

He rose to power west of [[Dai Commandery]] by taking in a number of Chinese refugees, who helped him drill his soldiers and make weapons. After the defeat of the Wuhuan in 207, he also sent tribute to Cao Cao, and even provided assistance against the rebel Tian Yin. In 218 he allied himself to the Wuhuan rebel Nengchendi but they were heavily defeated and forced back across the frontier by [[Cao Zhang]]. In 220 he acknowledged [[Cao Pi]] as emperor of Cao Wei. Eventually he turned on the Wei for frustrating his advances on another Xianbei khan, Sui. Kebineng conducted raids on Cao Wei before he was killed in 235, after which his confederacy disintegrated.{{sfn|de Crespigny|2007|p=289}}\n\nMany of the Xianbei tribes migrated south and settled on the borders of the Wei-Jin dynasties.

Their last stand as a steppe empire was in 89 when [[Dou Xian]] led an army of 45,000 and decisively defeated them at the [[Battle of the Altai Mountains]]. The Xiongnu Empire was replaced by a loose confederation of disorganized [[Xianbei]] tribes, who were nonetheless highly aggressive and proved problematic to their southern neighbors.{{sfn|di Cosmo|2009|p=103}} A southern branch of the Xiongnu split off from their northern neighbors in 50 AD and continued to exist as a Han puppet state in [[Bing Province]]. However, in 188 the Xiuchuge clan rebelled against their chanyu, [[Qiangqu]], for sending troops to aid the Han against the rebels Zhang Ju and Zhang Chun. They replaced Qiangqu with his son [[Chizhishizhuhou Chanyu|Yufuluo]], whose hold on power was tenuous, and he was ousted over a marquis of the Xubu clan. When the marquis of Xubu died the next year an elderly king became the nominal head of state without the title of Chanyu and the Southern Xiongnu ceased to exist as a coherent entity.{{sfn|de Crespigny|2017|p=426}} In 216 the Xiongnu of the [[Ordos loop|Ordos]] were settled but the region remained outside the jurisdiction of [[Cao Wei]]'s administration.{{sfn|de Crespigny|2010|p=454}}\n\nYufuluo fled to the Han court but found no support after the death of [[Emperor Ling of Han]] in 189.

Expeditions}}\n\nThe '''military history of the [[Three Kingdoms]]''' period encompasses roughly a century's worth of prolonged warfare and disorder. After the assassination of General-in-chief [[He Jin]] in September 189, the administrative structures of the Han government became increasingly irrelevant. By the time of death of [[Cao Cao]], the most successful warlord of North China, in 220, the Han empire was divided between the three rival states of [[Cao Wei]], [[Shu Han]] and [[Eastern Wu]]. Due to the ensuing turmoil, the competing powers of the Three Kingdoms era found no shortage of willing recruits for their armies, although press-ganging as well as forcible enlistment of prisoners from defeated armies still occurred. Following four centuries of rule under the [[Han dynasty]], the [[Three Kingdoms]] brought about a new era of conflict in [[China]] that shifted institutions in favor of a more permanent and selective system of military recruitment. This ultimately included the creation of a hereditary military class as well as increasing reliance on non-Chinese cavalry forces and the end of universal conscription.\n\n==Organization==\n[[File:3Kshield.jpg|thumb|Wei shieldbearer]]\n[[File:Weijin soldiers.jpg|thumb|Wei-Jin shieldbearers]]\n[[File:Weijin cavalry.jpg|thumb|Wei-Jin cavalry]]\n[[File:Three Kingdoms battering ram.jpg|thumb|Battering ram of the [[Three Kingdoms]]]]\n\n===Recruitment and organization===\nAs the Han dynasty fell into disarray after the [[Yellow Turban Rebellion]], its system of conscription and checks on military leadership broke down, giving local leaders the autonomy to recruit their own personal armies. At the heart of each army was a group of trusted Companions (\u89aa\u8fd1 ''qinjin'') consisting of family members, close friends and clansmen hired by whatever means was available to their lord. [[Cao Cao]]'s earliest commanders who formed the nucleus of his army were all clansmen ([[Cao Xiu]], [[Cao Zhen]], [[Cao Chun]]). There was no need for conscription as the conflicts of the late Han dynasty created willing recruits who sought protection under a strong army. This type of soldier, characterized by a lack of loyalty to state or nation, primarily concerned with survival, made up the majority of the army outside of the leader's close following.{{sfn|di Cosmo|2009|p=110-111}}{{sfn|Graff|2002|p=38}} Due to the lack of loyalty among common troops, acts of heroism and courage were particularly emphasized among commanders who were expected to lead from the front. A typical example of this type of commander would be [[Dian Wei]], a former local bully noted for his great strength, appetite, and his choice of weaponry, two halberds of immense weight, who served under [[Cao Cao]]. In 195, he personally led a group of volunteers clad in double armour (\u5169\u93a7 ''liang kai'') against [[L\u00fc Bu]]'s forces while his liege made his escape. He was promoted to colonel of the bodyguard unit known as the Tiger Warriors and later met his death against [[Zhang Xiu (warlord)|Zhang Xiu]] in 197.{{sfn|de Crespigny|2010|p=172-173}}<ref>{{cite web|url=https://openresearch-repository.anu.edu.au/html/1885/42048/mil_org.html|title=Later Han Military Organisation|access-date=July 25, 2018}}{{Dead link|date=April 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> While echoes of Han organization continued through the formal titles of military structure, in effect the wars of the Three Kingdoms were fought between armies of bands led by individuals selected by dint of violence and charisma.{{sfn|de Crespigny|2010|p=186}}\n\n===Training===\nMilitary training programs for the general populace in the inner provinces were mostly discontinued after 30 AD to reduce the risk of rebellion. The total number of professional soldiers in standing armies in the Eastern Han, including all the smaller groups, amounted to approximately 20,000 soldiers. Expeditions and campaigns relied upon tens of thousands of troops from local militia armies and non-Chinese auxiliaries, supplemented by professional and semi-professional troops. {{sfn|Crespigny|2017|p=163}} The men in the inner provinces of the empire could be called to serve during emergencies or serve in local militias to fight against bandits, but these men received no formal training or regular exercise. On the other hand, men of the frontier provinces were liable for conscription and military service as before. {{sfn|de Crespigny|2010|p=154-155}} This had a negative impact on the performance of the Han army, as noted by [[Ying Shao]], who remarked that \"sending [such] men into battle without training is just throwing them away\".{{sfn|de Crespigny|2010|p=155}} The majority of soldiers recruited during the early stages of the Three Kingdoms period were thus \"neither disciplined nor well trained in the use of arms\".{{sfn|de Crespigny|2010|p=167-168}} Formations and drill still existed, but these were the exceptions rather than the norm, and there is no evidence of troops engaging in a regular training system or large scale exercises.{{sfn|de Crespigny|2010|p=168}} Most commanders favored simple rather than complex formations and maneuvers. An example of a formation that did exist is [[Zhuge Liang]]'s Eight Formation Plan, which included different configurations named after Heaven, Earth, Wind, and Clouds. It's not clear what these designations mean, but the Eight Formation Plan was traditionally a square formation composed of nine divisions in three sections.{{sfn|de Crespigny|2010|p=190}} The lack of training severely constrained the kind of orders a commander could give for his troops to follow. As a consequence of the limited tactical flexibility at their disposal, the majority of battles were carried out in one of two ways: a head on charge by elite shock troops followed by the loosely organized army of incoherent and disparately trained and equipped soldiers, or ambush and surprise the enemy before they could even respond and cause them to route.{{sfn|de Crespigny|2010|p=173-175}}\n\n{{quotation|Yuan Shao moved to attack Gongsun Zan and the two sides met in battle twenty li south of Jie Bridge. Gongsun Zan had thirty thousand foot soldiers in square formation and ten thousand horsemen split into left and right wings. His White Cavalry Volunteers followed in the center. They split in two, the left riding right, and the right riding left. Their armour and flags shined with brilliance, lighting up heaven and earth. Yuan Shao sent Qu Yi against them with eight hundred soldiers while a thousand crossbowmen on either side supported his advance. Yuan Shao himself led tens of thousands of soldiers from the rear. Qu Yi had resided in Liangzhou for a long time and was familiar with the way of war as practiced by the Qiang tribes. Seeing Qu Yi's small force, Gongsun Zan sent cavalry to crush them. Qu Yi's troops hid behind their shields and made no move until the enemy were ten or twenty yards away; then they leapt up together, their cries shaking the ground, rushing forward with crossbows shooting bolts like thunder, killing all who were struck, and completely defeated Gongsun Zan's army...... killing more than a thousand armed men, Yuan Shao's troops maintained their pursuit to Jie Bridge. Gongsun Zan rallied his troops to turn and fight, but Qu Yi again defeated them. Reaching Gongsun Zan's camp, they captured his standard and the rest of his army took to flight.<ref>\u516c\u5b6b\u74da\u64ca\u9752\u5dde\u9ec3\u5dfe\u8cca\uff0c\u5927\u7834\u4e4b\uff0c\u9084\u5c6f\u5ee3\u5b97\uff0c\u6539\u6613\u5b88\u4ee4\uff0c\u5180\u5dde\u9577\u540f\u7121\u4e0d\u671b\u98a8\u97ff\u61c9\uff0c\u958b\u9580\u53d7\u4e4b\u3002\u7d39\u81ea\u5f80\u5f81\u74da\uff0c\u5408\u6230\u4e8e\u754c\u6a4b\u5357\u4e8c\u5341\u91cc\u3002\u74da\u6b65\u5175\u4e09\u842c\u9918\u4eba\u70ba\u65b9\u9673\uff0c\u9a0e\u70ba\u5169\u7ffc\uff0c\u5de6\u53f3\u5404\u4e94\u5343\u9918\u5339\uff0c\u767d\u99ac\u7fa9\u5f9e\u70ba\u4e2d\u5805\uff0c\u4ea6\u5206\u4f5c\u5169\u6821\uff0c\u5de6\u5c04\u53f3\uff0c\u53f3\u5c04\u5de6\uff0c\u65cc\u65d7\u93a7\u7532\uff0c\u5149\u7167\u5929\u5730\u3002\u7fa9\u4e45\u5728\u6dbc\u5dde\uff0c\u66c9\u7fd2\u7f8c\u9b25\uff0c\u5175\u7686\u9a4d\u92b3\u3002\u74da\u898b\u5176\u5175\u5c11\uff0c\u4fbf\u653e\u9a0e\u6b32\u9675\u8e48\u4e4b\u3002\u7fa9\u5175\u7686\u4f0f\u696f\u4e0b\u4e0d\u52d5\uff0c\u672a\u81f3\u6578\u5341\u6b65\uff0c\u4e43\u540c\u6642\u4ff1\u8d77\uff0c\u63da\u5875\u5927\u53eb\uff0c\u76f4\u524d\u885d\u7a81\uff0c\u5f4a\u5f29\u96f7\u767c\uff0c\u6240\u4e2d\u5fc5\u5012\uff0c\u81e8\u9673\u65ac\u74da\u6240\u7f72\u5180\u5dde\u523a\u53f2\u56b4\u7db1\u7532\u9996\u5343\u9918\u7d1a\u3002\u4ee4\u9eb4\u7fa9\u4ee5\u516b\u767e\u5175\u70ba\u5148\u767b\uff0c\u5f4a\u5f29\u5343\u5f35\u593e\u627f\u4e4b\uff0c\u7d39\u81ea\u4ee5\u6b65\u5175\u6578\u842c\u7d50\u9673\u4e8e\u5f8c\u3002\u74da\u8ecd\u6557\u7e3e\uff0c\u6b65\u9a0e\u5954\u8d70\uff0c\u4e0d\u5fa9\u9084\u71df\u3002\u7fa9\u8ffd\u81f3\u754c\u6a4b\uff1b\u74da\u6bbf\u5175\u9084\u6230\u6a4b\u4e0a\uff0c\u7fa9\u5fa9\u7834\u4e4b\uff0c\u9042\u5230\u74da\u71df\uff0c\u62d4\u5176\u7259\u9580\uff0c\u71df\u4e2d\u9918\u773e\u7686\u5fa9\u6563\u8d70\u3002</ref>|''Sanguo Zhi''}}\n\nThe training that the privileged elite received was far greater in extent compared to that of the common soldier. For example, [[Cao Cao]]'s son, [[Cao Pi]], started his military education in early childhood. He began training in archery at the age of five, started learning how to ride a horse at the age of six, and could both ride and shoot a target at a hundred paces by the time he was eight.{{sfn|Lorge|2011|p=80-81}} Horse archery was also practiced in [[Shu Han]], which fielded a \"Flying Army\" of mounted archers.{{sfn|Peers|2006|p=83}}\n\n===Hereditary troops===\nIn contrast to the military hierarchy of the Han dynasty, leadership of a unit in the Three Kingdoms was functionally hereditary as long as the successor was loyal to his liege and proved militarily competent. When the commander died, a male member of his family inherited control of his troops, and when a soldier died one of his male relatives inherited his position in the unit. By the end of the Three Kingdoms, the term ''buqu'' (\u90e8\u66f2) had come to designate the institution of hereditary military leadership. Both ''bu'' and ''qu'', meaning battalions and companies, were originally units of military organization during the Han. Under Cao Cao, a more systematic form of hereditary soldiery was implemented through \"military families\" (\u58eb\u5bb6 ''shijia'') which later became \"hereditary troops\" (\u4e16\u5175 ''shibing''). As their name implies, able male members born into military families served for life, and when they could no longer serve because of illness or death, their sons or close family members replaced them. Their families lived at the capital and other major centers where they could be used by the government as hostages to ensure the loyalty of their soldiers. They were also forbidden from marrying into non-military families in order to prevent their offspring from exiting the system, thus creating a closed community of military households. Although commoners could still be called up in times of urgent need, the rise of government mandated military communities under [[Cao Wei]] and the demobilization of local levies under the [[Jin dynasty (265\u2013420)|Jin dynasty]], had by and large, replaced the universal conscription of the Han.{{sfn|Graff|2002|p=38-39}}\n\n===Tuntian===\n[[Tuntian]], often rendered as \"[military] agricultural colonies,\" were self-sustaining farming communities created for the purpose of providing food for the military. Generally consisting of displaced peoples, refugees, and bandits, tenants of a tuntian were expected to protect themselves in times of emergencies and in return were exempt from corv\u00e9e labour. Unlike the tuntian system of the Han dynasty, which was generally hands off, the tuntian policy of the Three Kingdoms era was to directly provide them with supplies and material assistance. The policy of tuntian was implemented primarily by [[Cao Cao]], [[Tao Qian (Han dynasty)|Tao Qian]], and [[Gongsun Zan]].{{sfn|de Crespigny|2010|p=89-90}}\n\n==Equipment==\n[[File:3K arrow moulds.jpg|thumb|Three Kingdoms arrow mould]]\n[[File:Gold and Silver Inlaid Bronze Crossbow Trigger of General Sun Lin.jpg|thumb|[[Three Kingdoms]] [[crossbow]] trigger]]\n[[File:Three Kingdoms Iron Arrowheads.jpg|thumb|[[Three Kingdoms]] arrowheads]]\n[[File:3K spearhead and caltrops.jpg|thumb|Three Kingdoms caltrops and spearhead]]\nArmies of the Three Kingdoms era used largely the same equipment as the Han dynasty since it directly follows the end of the Han. There were however some minor differences and developments such as the increasing prevalence of armoured cavalry. In one battle, the warlord [[Cao Cao]] boasted that with only ten sets of horse armour he had faced an enemy with three hundred sets.{{sfn|Graff|2002|p=42}} The horse armour may however have just been partial frontal barding.{{sfn|Peers|2006|p=83}} Mounting [[stirrup]]s were already in use, possibly as early as the Han dynasty, but full riding stirrups would not appear until the 4th century.{{sfn|de Crespigny|2010|p=171-172}} References to \"dark armour\" (''xuan kai'' or ''xuan jia'' \u7384\u93a7/\u7384\u7532) and \"brilliant armour\" also began to appear in the 3rd century. This is probably in reference to the association of high quality steel with black ferrous material.{{sfn|Wagner|2008|p=322}}\n\nWeapons were largely the same as well, although there was more focus on idiosyncratic weapons wielded by particularly noteworthy individuals. For example, one man named Chen An apparently wielded a great sword over two meters in length{{sfn|Lorge|2011|p=80}} and [[Sun Quan]]'s wife had over a hundred female attendants armed with daos.{{sfn|Lorge|2011|p=86}} Trends in warfare that had already been underway during the Eastern Han continued to gain momentum. By the end of the Three Kingdoms, the single edged dao, with its thicker and more durable dull side, had overtaken the straight double-edged jian as the primary close combat weapon.{{sfn|Lorge|2011|p=78}} The more expensive, lighter, and less durable jian entered the domain of court dancers, officials, and expert warriors.{{sfn|Lorge|2011|p=83}} While halberds were still used during the period, long spears and lances (similar to pikes) re-rose in prominence over halberds for infantry and cavalry forces. This was believed to have been the result of the long spear and lances' simpler construction, the adoption of long spears and lances by heavy cavalry to strike infantrymen, and the adoption of tighter infantry formations with less room for swinging and hooking [of halberds] in response to the greater threat by cavalry. {{sfn|Lorge|2011|p=78}}{{sfn|Graff|2002|p=41}} Soldiers in the northeast specialized in long spears.<ref>(\u9b4f\u66f8\u66f0\uff1a\u8b70\u8005\u591a\u8a00\u300c\u95dc\u897f\u5175\u5f4a\uff0c\u7fd2\u9577\u77db\uff0c\u975e\u7cbe\u9078\u524d\u92d2\uff0c\u5247\u4e0d\u53ef\u4ee5\u7576\u4e5f\u300d\u3002\u516c\u8b02\u8af8\u5c07\u66f0\uff1a\u300c\u6230\u5728\u6211\uff0c\u975e\u5728\u8cca\u4e5f\u3002\u8cca\u96d6\u7fd2\u9577\u77db\uff0c\u5c07\u4f7f\u4e0d\u5f97\u4ee5\u523a\uff0c\u8af8\u541b\u4f46\u89c0\u4e4b\u8033\u3002\u300d) ''Wei Shu'' annotation in ''Sanguozhi'' vol. 1.</ref> After the Han dynasty, the crossbow gradually faded in importance until it made a mild resurgence during the [[Tang dynasty]], under which the ideal expeditionary army of 20,000 included 2,200 archers and 2,000 crossbowmen.{{sfn|Graff|2002|p=193}}\n\nReferences to \"great shields\" occur in their usage on the front line to protect spearmen and crossbowmen. Shields were also commonly paired with the single edged dao and used among cavalrymen.{{sfn|Peers|2006|p=146}} Descriptions of the [[Battle of Guandu]] mention that Cao Cao's soldiers employed shield cover above their heads each time they moved out into the open due to oppressive arrow fire from [[Yuan Shao]]'s wooden towers.{{sfn|de Crespigny|2010|p=142}}\n\nAlthough Zhuge Liang is often credited with the invention of the [[repeating crossbow]], this is actually due to a mistranslation confusing it with the multiple bolt crossbow. The source actually says Zhuge invented a multiple bolt crossbow that could shoot ten iron bolts simultaneously, each 20&nbsp;cm long.{{sfn|Liang|2006}}\n\n===Dark armour===\nA report in 231 AD mentions the capture of 5,000 suits of \"dark armour\" (''xuan kai'' or ''xuan jia'' \u7384\u93a7/\u7384\u7532) and 3,100 crossbows. Dark armour appears in Han texts as well, but only as the attire worn by honor guards at funeral processions. The only known trait about dark armour is that it reflected the sun's rays. This probably means dark armour was made of high quality steel, which was often associated with black ferrous material.{{sfn|Wagner|2008|p=322}}\n\n===Brilliant armour===\n[[Cao Zhi]] mentioned three different kinds of armour, two of which were variants of \"brilliant\" armour:\n\n{{quotation|The Previous Emperor presented your vassal with armor (kai), to wit, a suit of \"black-brilliant\" (heiguang) and one of \"bright-brilliant\" (mingguang) and a suit of \"double-faced\" (liangtang) armor, but now that the present age is peaceful and the weapons and armor (bingge) are not of use, I request leave to turn them all over to the Armor Board (kaicao) to be taken care of.{{sfn|Dien|1981|p=16}}|[[Cao Zhi]]}}\n\nBrilliant armour was made of decarburized steel, which shines blue-black when polished, giving it its name. [[Chen Lin (Han dynasty)|Chen Lin]] described brilliant armour in the following manner:\n\n{{quotation|As for the armor (kai) then like that of Quegong of the Eastern Barbarians,<br>It is made of the finest steel refined a hundred times;<br>The armorer has plied his hammer,<br>The leather-worker has made the stitching;<br> [Adorned with] dark feathers the flashing armor (jia)<br> Gleams and shines, throwing off light.{{sfn|Dien|1981|p=17}}|Chen Lin}}\n\n===Wheel catapult===\n[[Ma Jun]], a military engineer serving under [[Cao Wei]], devised a siege weapon which threw large stones using a wheel. This device consisted of a drum wheel attached with a curved knife. When rotated, the stones which hung on the wheel would be cut loose by the knife and launched. It's not clear how well this device worked in practice. Successful tests with roof tiles instead of stones are mentioned, but according to Liang Jieming, this contraption never made it past the testing phase and could not have been possible with the technology available at the time.{{sfn|Liang|2006}}\n\n===Special weapons===\nThe historical novel [[Romance of the Three Kingdoms]] attributes a number of fictional weapons, often with special names, to certain individuals. Examples include [[Liu Bei]]'s \"Paired Winding Swords\" (\u96d9\u80a1\u528d), [[Guan Yu]]'s \"[[Green Dragon Crescent Blade]]\" (\u9752\u9f8d\u5043\u6708\u5200), [[Zhang Fei]]'s \"Eighteen chi Serpent Lance\" (\u4e08\u516b\u86c7\u77db), [[Zhao Yun]]'s \"Blue Steel Sword\" (\u9752\u91ed\u528d), [[Cao Cao]]'s \"Sword of Heaven\" (\u501a\u5929\u528d), [[Sun Jian]]'s \"Ancient Ingot Blade\" (\u53e4\u9320\u5200), [[Cheng Pu]]'s \"Ironspine Serpent Lance\" (\u9435\u810a\u86c7\u77db), and L\u00fc Bu's \"Fangtianhua Ji\" (\u65b9\u5929\u756b\u621f), otherwise known as the \"Sky Piercer\" or \"Sky Piercing Halberd\". While these are completely fictional, the [[Records of the Three Kingdoms]] do mention weapons unique to individuals on at least two occasions: [[Dian Wei]]'s double halberd which weighed 20&nbsp;kg{{sfn|de Crespigny|2010|p=79}} and [[Gongsun Zan]]'s two-bladed spear.{{sfn|Lorge|2011|p=79}}\n\n==Single combat==\n[[File:Three Kingdoms daos.jpg|thumb|Daos from the Three Kingdoms period]]\n\nThe [[Records of the Three Kingdoms]] and [[Annotations to Records of the Three Kingdoms]] contain two instances of single combat between generals. In 192, after [[Dong Zhuo]] had been murdered, [[Li Jue (Han Dynasty)|Li Jue]] and [[Guo Si]] formed an army to oust [[Wang Yun (Han dynasty)|Wang Yun]] and [[L\u00fc Bu]] from [[Chang'an]]. When Guo Si approached the city from the north, L\u00fc Bu opened the gate and offered to settle the matter by single combat. Guo Si agreed and engaged with L\u00fc Bu, who pierced Guo Si with his lance. Guo Si's men came forth, saving their general, and both sides withdrew.<ref>(\u82f1\u96c4\u8a18\u66f0\uff1a\u90ed\u6c5c\u5728\u57ce\u5317\u3002\u5e03\u958b\u57ce\u9580\uff0c\u5c07\u5175\u5c31\u6c5c\uff0c\u8a00\u300c\u4e14\u5374\u5175\uff0c\u4f46\u8eab\u6c7a\u52dd\u8ca0\u300d\u3002\u6c5c\u3001\u5e03\u4e43\u7368\u5171\u5c0d\u6230\uff0c\u5e03\u4ee5\u77db\u523a\u4e2d\u6c5c\uff0c\u6c5c\u5f8c\u9a0e\u9042\u524d\u6551\u6c5c\uff0c\u6c5c\u3001\u5e03\u9042\u5404\u5169\u7f77\u3002) (Rough Translation: Guo Si approached the city from the north.

''Yingxiong Ji'' annotation in ''Sanguozhi'' vol. 7.</ref> Another instance of individual combat occurred between [[Taishi Ci]], then serving under [[Liu Yao]], and [[Sun Ce]]. Taishi Ci was on a mission accompanied by only a single horseman when he met Sun Ce, who had 13 other men with him. Taishi Ci charged at Sun Ce and the two sides clashed in single combat. Sun Ce pierced Taishi's horse and managed to grab hold of his halberd while Taishi removed Sun's helmet.

During his childhood Cao Cao studied the ''[[Art of War]]'' and was fond of [[hawking (birds)|hawking]] and hunting with dogs. He was also considered a troublemaker and local thug in his town. At one point in his youth, Cao Cao and [[Yuan Shao]] raided a wedding. Cao Cao kidnapped the bride and directed the pursuers toward Yuan Shao.{{sfn|Crespigny|2007|p=xiv}} [[Xu Shao]] foretold that Cao Cao would be \"a good servant in time of peace, a dangerous chieftain in time of trouble\".{{sfn|de Crespigny|2007|p=35}}\n\nIn the 170s Cao Cao became a chief of police in [[Luoyang]] and made a name for himself as a strict enforcer of the law. He was eventually implicated and dismissed from his post in 178.{{sfn|de Crespigny|2007|p=35}}\n\nCao Cao took part in suppressing the [[Yellow Turban]] rebellion in 184 as a Commandant of Cavalry. He was then appointed Chancellor of [[Ji'nan Commandery]], where he set about removing officials under the influence of the imperial family. Cao Cao became afraid of the enemies he had made at court so he left his post.{{sfn|de Crespigny|2007|p=35}}\n\nIn 188 Cao Cao became a colonel of the Western Garden. When [[Dong Zhuo]] seized power in 189, Cao Cao fled to [[Chenliu Commandery]], where he sold his family estates and raised troops to join [[Yuan Shao]] and the [[Campaign against Dong Zhuo]]. Irritated by Yuan Shao's lack of action, Cao Cao advanced into [[He'nan Commandery]] only to suffer defeat at the [[Battle of Xingyang (190)|Battle of Xingyang]].{{sfn|de Crespigny|2007|p=36}}\n\nCao Cao raised more troops in [[Yang Province]]. In 191 he became Administrator of [[Dong Commandery]] for defeating the bandit chieftain [[Bo Rao]]. When [[Liu Dai]], the Inspector of [[Yan Province]], died in 192 while dealing with the Yellow Turbans from [[Qing Province]], Cao Cao succeeded him. By the end of the year Cao Cao had negotiated the surrender of the rebels, who augmented his army with 30,000 additional soldiers, known collectively as the [[Qingzhou Troops]] (\u9752\u5dde\u5175).{{sfn|de Crespigny|2007|p=36}}\n\nIn 193 Cao Cao drove away [[Yuan Shu]] to the south. At this time however, his father Cao Song and brother Cao De were killed by some of the rogue troops of [[Tao Qian (Han dynasty)|Tao Qian]], the Governor of [[Xu Province]]. Cao Cao invaded Xu Province in retaliation massacring hundreds of thousands of civilians on his first campaign, but in 194 while on his second campaign against Tao Qian his former friend [[Zhang Miao]] raised the flag of rebellion in Yan Province. With the aid of [[L\u00fc Bu]], the rebels dealt several defeats to Cao Cao, taking most of the province. Eventually the tide turned on them and Cao Cao regained his territories. Zhang Miao's family was destroyed while L\u00fc Bu fled to Xu Province.{{sfn|de Crespigny|2007|p=36}}\n\nIn 196 Cao Cao took control of the imperial court and moved it to [[Xuchang|Xu city]]. In 197 Cao Cao came into conflict with [[Zhang Xiu (warlord)|Zhang Xiu]] and Liu Biao. However he retreated due to news of a potential raid by Yuan Shao. In 198 [[Liu Bei]] took refuge with Cao Cao and requested his aid against L\u00fc Bu. Cao Cao laid siege to L\u00fc Bu in [[Xiapi Commandery]] and killed him that winter, taking control of Xu Province. Liu Bei rebelled and was driven away. Yuan Shao crossed the Yellow River with a large army in the spring of 200 but was too slow to mobilize. In the winter Cao Cao led a raiding party behind enemy lines and destroyed their supply train at the [[Battle of Guandu]], causing Yuan Shao's army to disintegrate. Meanwhile, Liu Bei had been making trouble in [[Ru'nan Commandery]] with the bandit [[Gong Du]]. With Yuan Shao no longer posing a threat, Cao Cao returned to deal with Liu Bei, driving him away to take refuge with Liu Biao.{{sfn|de Crespigny|2007|p=36-37}}\n\nIn the summer of 202, Yuan Shao died, leaving his territory to his sons. They fought among themselves and fell prey to Cao Cao's advances. By 205 he had ousted [[Yuan Tan]] and [[Yuan Shang]] from their southern territories. Over the next two years he brought [[Ji Province]] and southern [[Bing Province]] under his control. In the summer of 207 Cao Cao made a roundabout trip north and defeated the [[Wuhuan]] at the [[Battle of White Wolf Mountain]]. They fled to [[Gongsun Kang]] in [[Liaodong Commandery]], but he beheaded them and delivered their heads to Cao Cao.{{sfn|de Crespigny|2007|p=37}}\n\nAs Cao Cao prepared to campaign south in 208, Liu Biao died. His son [[Liu Zong]] surrendered while Liu Bei fled further south. Cao Cao followed and defeated Liu Bei at the [[Battle of Changban]]. Seizing the naval base at [[Jingzhou|Jiangling]], Cao Cao moved his new river fleet downstream. His confrontation with Liu Bei and the [[Sun Quan]]'s general [[Zhou Yu]] culminated in defeat and the destruction of his fleet at the [[Battle of Red Cliffs]]. Failing to cross the [[Changjiang]], Cao Cao retreated north.{{sfn|de Crespigny|2007|p=38}}\n\nIn 211 Cao Cao moved west against [[Zhang Lu (Han Dynasty)|Zhang Lu]] and in doing so also drew the ire of [[Ma Chao]] and [[Han Sui]]. They were outmaneuvered and defeated at the [[Battle of Tong Pass (211)|Battle of Tong Pass]]. In 212 Cao Cao left [[Xiahou Yuan]] behind to continue the northwestern campaign while he returned east to attack Sun Quan across the [[Huai River]]. The invasion forced reached the banks of the Changjiang but failed to break the enemy defenses. Cao Cao returned to [[Ye (Hebei)|Ye City]] in 213.{{sfn|de Crespigny|2007|p=38}}\n\nIn 215 Cao Cao eliminated Zhang Lu and occupied [[Hanzhong Commandery]]. Cao Cao attacked Sun Quan again in 217 after Sun Quan's failed attack in 215. However he was never able to make it past the Changjiang defenses but was able to gain Sun Quan's nominal surrender. In the spring of 219, his general Xiahou Yuan was killed at the [[Battle of Mount Dingjun]] and Cao Cao lost his position in Hanzhong Commandery. Liu Bei's general [[Guan Yu]] also defeated [[Yu Jin]]'s fores in [[Nanyang Commandery]] and laid siege to [[Cao Ren]] in [[Fancheng]].

Cao Pi deeply distrusted his close kin and reduced their powers out of suspicion of their loyalty. Cao Pi died in 226 and was succeeded by his son [[Cao Rui]]. Although Cao Rui was twenty years old, he was nonetheless appointed a regency council by his father prior to his death. By 236, three members of the regency council had died, leaving [[Sima Yi]] as the primary leader of Cao Wei. Before this time, [[Shu Han]] launch attacks on the Wei borders and in 229, [[Zhuge Liang]] occupied [[Wudu Commandery]]. He was, however, unable to make any further gains during his battles against Sima Yi and died in 234. {{sfn|de Crespigny|2010|p=455}} In 238 Sima Yi annexed the Gongsun state in the northwest.{{sfn|de Crespigny|2010|p=456}} This was followed by a campaign into [[Goguryeo]] in 244 and 245.{{sfn|de Crespigny|2010|p=456}} Cao Rui died in 239 and was succeeded by his adopted son [[Cao Fang]], who fell under the regency of [[Cao Shuang]] and Sima Yi.{{sfn|de Crespigny|2010|p=459}}\n\nIn 249 Sima Yi killed Cao Shuang and seized power in Wei. He died two years later and was succeeded by his son [[Sima Shi]]. Cao Fang tried to retake power for himself in 254 but failed and was replaced by his cousin, [[Cao Mao]]. Sima Shi died in 255 and was succeeded by his brother [[Sima Zhao]]. In 260 Cao Mao, like his cousin, attempted to seize control of the state, but failed and died in the process. In 264 Sima Zhao conquered [[Shu Han]], eliminating one of the Three Kingdoms. He died the following year and was succeeded by his son [[Sima Yan]]. On 8 February 266, Sima Yan deposed the last emperor of Wei, [[Cao Huan]], and proclaimed himself Emperor of the [[Jin dynasty (265\u2013420)|Jin dynasty]].{{sfn|de Crespigny|2010|p=461}}\n\nSima Yan went on to annex the southern state of [[Eastern Wu]] in 280, putting an end to the period of the Three Kingdoms.{{sfn|de Crespigny|2010|p=461}}\n\n===Shu Han===\n[[File:Liu Bei Tang.jpg|thumb|[[Liu Bei]]]]\n[[File:\u4f0d\u4f2f\u753b\u50cf\u7816.jpg|thumb|Late Eastern Han-Three Kingdoms era brick relief of shieldbearers with spears from modern [[Sichuan]], the area occupied by Shu han]]\n[[Shu Han]] was founded by [[Liu Bei]] in 221 and was conquered by [[Cao Wei]] in 263.\n\n====Liu Bei====\n\n[[Liu Bei]] was a very distant descendant of [[Emperor Jing of Han]]. His father Liu Hong died when he was still very young and his mother made a living by selling straw sandals. In 175 Liu Bei was sent to study at the [[Taixue]] of [[Luoyang]], where he became friends with [[Gongsun Zan]]. Liu Bei had very little interest in books but had a knack for fighting and inspired many young men to join him. With the support of two merchants, Zhang Shiping and Su Shuang, Liu Bei was able to create a sizable following including his long time friends [[Guan Yu]] and [[Zhang Fei]]. When the [[Yellow Turban Rebellion]] broke out in 184 Liu Bei led his troops against them under various commanders. He did well in both campaigns but was only rewarded with a very low position in the imperial service. He abandoned his post when an officer tried to reduce his position and joined [[Guanqiu Yi]] on an expedition against rebels in [[Danyang Commandery]]. For his service in that expedition he was rewarded with the post of assistant magistrate in a county in [[Pingyuan Commandery]]. When the anti-[[Dong Zhuo]] coalition formed, Liu Bei raised troops in their service, but soon afterwards left to join his friend Gongsun Zan in the north.{{sfn|de Crespigny|2007|p=478-479}}\n\nLiu Bei assisted Gongsun Zan against his rival [[Yuan Shao]] in 191 and was given the post of magistrate in Pingyuan Commandery. His post didn't last long as Yuan Shao dealt a devastating blow to Gongsun Zan in 192 and Liu Bei was forced to move east to Qi Commandery. When [[Tao Qian (Han dynasty)|Tao Qian]] of [[Xu Province]] offered him 4,000 troops and a post in [[Pei Commandery]], Liu Bei accepted. Tao Qian died in 194 and Liu Bei succeeded him as Governor of Xu Province. In 196 [[Yuan Shu]] invaded from the south and fought Liu Bei for a month at a stalemate. During this time however, Liu Bei had lost [[Xiapi Commandery]] due to [[Zhang Fei]] killing its Chancellor allowing [[L\u00fc Bu]], who was at the time taking refuge in the province, to attack Liu Bei and forced him to surrender. Having defeated Liu Bei and taken control of Xu Province, L\u00fc Bu drove away Yuan Shu's army. Though he was defeated, Liu Bei still retained Pei Commandery. When Yuan Shu attacked Liu Bei again, L\u00fc Bu prevented his advance out of fear that Yuan Shu would become too powerful. Liu Bei continued to recruit troops until 198 when he intercepted a trade convoy from L\u00fc Bu. L\u00fc Bu's officers [[Gao Shun]] and [[Zhang Liao]] retaliated, taking Pei Commandery and forcing Liu Bei to flee to [[Cao Cao]]. Cao Cao sent an army under [[Xiahou Dun]] to assist Liu Bei against L\u00fc Bu. In the autumn their army was defeated by Gao Shun. When Cao Cao joined them in the winter, they successfully laid siege to L\u00fc Bu in Xiapi Commandery and killed him the following year.{{sfn|de Crespigny|2007|p=479}}\n\nIn 199 Liu Bei was sent to intercept Yuan Shu from making contact with Yuan Shao. When Liu Bei reached Xu Province, he rebelled, killing the Inspector [[Che Zhou]]. Cao Cao's initial attempt to suppress him ended in failure but the second one in 200 succeeded. Liu Bei abandoned his family and Guan Yu, who were captured, and fled to Yuan Shao in [[Qing Province]]. He was sent to [[Ru'nan Commandery]] to assist the bandit [[Gong Du]] but suffered defeat at the hands of Cao Cao's officer [[Cao Ren]].He was however able to defeat and kill Cao Cao's officer [[Cai Yang]]. Yuan Shao's army was defeated in 200 at the [[Battle of Guandu]] and Liu Bei was forced to take refuge with [[Liu Biao]] in [[Jing Province]].{{sfn|de Crespigny|2007|p=480}}\n\nStationed on the northern frontier of Jing Province, in 202 Liu Bei achieved victory against Xiahou Dun and [[Yu Jin]] at the [[Battle of Bowang]]. After that Cao Cao became preoccupied with the north while Liu Bei was recalled to court. During his stay with Liu Biao, Liu Bei recruited [[Zhuge Liang]], who would later become the leading military figure of Shu Han. In the autumn of 208 Liu Biao died and Cao Cao moved to invade. Liu Biao's son [[Liu Zong]] chose to surrender. Liu Bei led his followers south to the [[Changjiang]] where they were heavily defeated by Cao Cao at the [[Battle of Changban]] in [[Nan Commandery]]. While Cao Cao occupied the naval base at [[Jingzhou|Jiangling]], Liu Bei retreated to the southeast towards [[Battle of Xiakou|Xiakou]], and [[Zhou Yu]], general of [[Sun Quan]] to the east, came upriver with a sizable army. Having augmented his main army with Jing Province's fleet, Cao Cao continued his advance in the winter against Zhou Yu and Liu Bei's forces arrayed on the east bank of the Changjiang. Despite his superior numbers, Cao Cao was defeated at the [[Battle of Red Cliffs]] and his fleet was destroyed by a deployment of fire ships by Sun Quan's officer, [[Huang Gai]]. In the winter of 208-209 Liu Bei has conquered most of southern Jing while Zhou Yu had captured Jiangling thus ending any hope Cao Cao had of obtaining area across the Changjiang.{{sfn|de Crespigny|2007|p=481}}\n\nAfter [[Liu Qi (Liu Biao's son)|Liu Qi]] died in 208, Liu Bei became the Governor of Jing Province. Zhou Yu died in 210 and his successor [[Lu Su]] convinced Sun Quan to \"lend\"(give) Liu Bei Nan Commandery. In 211 [[Liu Zhang (warlord)|Liu Zhang]] invited Liu Bei to [[Yi Province]] as an ally. In 212 Liu Bei betrayed Liu Zhang and attacked him, waging a two-year war that ended in Liu Zhang's surrender and Liu Bei's conquest of Yi Province. In 215 Sun Quan demanded that Liu Bei give him all of southern Jing Province that Liu Bei had obtained. When Liu Bei denied his demands, Sun Quan sent an invasion force commanded by [[L\u00fc Meng]] and [[Lu Su]] and Liu Bei sent Guan Yu to confront the two in response while he gathers troops for an inevitable battle. A settlement was eventual reached, dividing southern Jing along the [[Xiang River]]. In 217 Liu Bei invaded [[Hanzhong Commandery]], which was then under the control of Cao Cao, and solidified his gains in 219 by achieving a decisive victory over the Cao army and killing [[Xiahou Yuan]].{{sfn|de Crespigny|2007|p=482}}\n\nIn the autumn of 219, Liu Bei proclaimed himself King of Hanzhong at a coronation ceremony in [[Mianyang]], and established a court in [[Chengdu]]. Liu Bei's general, Guan Yu, besieged [[Fan city]], in modern [[Xiangfan]], but Cao Cao's cousin [[Cao Ren]] held out and Cao Cao's officer [[Xu Huang]] came to his rescue and drove Guan Yu away from Fan Castle. In the winter while Guan Yu was fighting against Cao Ren an offensive by L\u00fc Meng into Nan Commandery ruined Guan Yu's position and he was killed by Lu Meng upon his capture. Sun Quan thus had seized all of Jing Province.{{sfn|de Crespigny|2007|p=483}}\n\nOn 15 May 221, Liu Bei proclaimed himself emperor. He then attacked Sun Quan through the [[Three Gorges]] and into the middle Changjiang. The following year [[Lu Xun]] destroyed Liu Bei's line of camps and forced him to retreat to Baidi Castle with heavy losses. Liu Bei fell ill soon after the battle and upon Sun Quan being under attack by the forces of [[Cao Pi]] the two reformed their alliance. Liu Bei died in the summer of 223 and was succeeded by his son [[Liu Shan]], though the government was effectively under the control of Zhuge Liang as a part of Liu Bei's dying request.{{sfn|de Crespigny|2007|p=483}}\n\n====Liu Shan====\n[[Liu Shan]] was only 17 years old when his father died and lacked the ability to lead so [[Zhuge Liang]] became de facto head of state. In 224 and 225 Zhuge Liang embarked on a [[Zhuge Liang's Southern Campaign|Southern Campaign]] which brought at least nominal submission from chieftains in the south of [[Yi Province]]. In the north Zhuge Liang made [[Zhuge Liang's Northern Expeditions|several attempts]] to break through the [[Qinling]] range, managing to occupy [[Wudu Commandery]] in 229. However he was unable to press farther north in his conflicts with [[Sima Yi]] and died in 234. Unlike the Sun and Cao regimes, Shu Han never managed to create anything more than an ad hoc warlord regime, probably because its leaders were not native to the region. In 264 Shu Han was conquered by [[Sima Zhao]], the de facto ruler of Cao Wei, whose son [[Sima Yan]] would go on to depose the Cao sovereign on 8 February 266, and proclaim himself emperor of the [[Jin dynasty (265\u2013420)|Jin dynasty]].{{sfn|de Crespigny|2010|p=461}}\n\n===Eastern Wu===\n[[File:Sun Quan Tang.jpg|thumb|[[Sun Quan]]]]\n[[File:Pottery courtyard, 3 kingdoms, Wu, Hubei, 1967.

Although his family was of no great importance, they were purportedly descendants of the military strategist [[Sun Zi]], who is traditionally credited with the authorship of ''The Art of War''. Whether the claimed ancestry is true or not, Sun Jian's family played little role in the affairs of the Han dynasty, and next to nothing is known about Sun Jian's obscure lineage.{{sfn|de Crespigny|2004|p=70-72}}\n\nAs a youth, Sun Jian was described as unusual in appearance, kind, intelligent, but fond of odd behavior. At the young age of 16 he was appointed a junior civil officer in the county administration. Sun Jian first made a name for himself at the age of 17 when he went on a trip with his father to [[Hangzhou|Qiantang]]. During the trip they heard of a band of pirates led by Hu Yu robbing nearby travelers. Sun Jian wanted to attack them while his father wanted nothing to do with the pirates. Even so, Sun Jian set out to confront the pirates. He climbed onto a hill overlooking their camp and waved his sword as if directing soldiers to attack. The pirates thought Sun Jian was part of a government force so they fled. Sun Jian chased after them and took one head as proof of his success. Thereafter, he was promoted to Commandant.{{sfn|de Crespigny|2004|p=77}}\n\nIn 172, Sun Jian was appointed Major of troops in Wu Commandery to put down a rebellion by [[Xu Chang]] in [[Kuaiji Commandery]]. Sun Jian's success against the rebels drew the attention of [[Zang Min]], who was in overall command of local forces. With Zang Min's recommendation, Sun Jian became Assistant in the county of [[Yandu]], [[Guangling Commandery]]. For the next ten years he remained an official in [[Xu Province]], where he gained a sizable following, and was well liked by those around him:\n\n{{quotation|Wherever Sun Jian went he gained a good reputation, and the officers and people loved him and trusted him. There were always hundreds of his old friends from his home district and young adventurers who came visiting him. Sun Jian looked after them and cared for them like his own family.{{sfn|de Crespigny|2004|p=84}}|''[[Sanguo Zhi]]''}}\n\nWhen the [[Yellow Turban Rebellion]] broke out in 184, Sun Jian was called up by [[Zhu Jun (Han dynasty)|Zhu Jun]] in Kuaiji Commandery, and appointed Associate Major. None could stand against him. Sun Jian constantly led at the forefront of his troops, being the first to scale the walls of [[Wancheng]], dealing the last great blow to the Yellow Turbans.{{sfn|de Crespigny|2004|p=32}} After the Yellow Turbans' defeat, Sun Jian was transferred over to the west to deal with the [[Liang Province rebellion]]. During his time there, he came to butt heads with [[Dong Zhuo]], who felt that Sun Jian was a good commander but lacked quality troops.{{sfn|de Crespigny|2004|p=96}}\n\nIn 186, Sun Jian returned to the capital and in 187 was promoted to Grand Administrator of [[Changsha Commandery]]. As Grand Administrator, Sun Jian destroyed the local rebels [[Ou Xing]], [[Zhou Chao]], and [[Guo Shi]], even aiding neighboring commanderies, much to the consternation of his clerical officers:\n\n{{quotation|I have none of the civil graces. Warfare is my work. If I cross the borders to attack some rebels, that is simply giving help to a neighbour. Even if I am committing a crime, why should I feel ashamed?{{sfn|de Crespigny|2004|p=99-100}}|Sun Jian, ''[[Sanguo Zhi]]''}}\n\nFor his service in defeating the rebels, Sun Jian was enfeoffed as Marquis of Wucheng, the highest noble rank attainable for a man outside of the imperial family.{{sfn|de Crespigny|2004|p=100}}\n\nWhen [[Dong Zhuo]] seized power at [[Luoyang]] in 189, Sun Jian joined [[Yuan Shu]] and the [[Campaign against Dong Zhuo|anti-Dong Zhuo coalition]]. When Sun Jian passed by [[Jing Province]], he killed its Inspector [[Wang Rui (civil servant)|Wang Rui]] as well as the Administrator of [[Nanyang Commandery]], [[Zhang Zhi (calligrapher)|Zhang Zhi]], and took over their troops. Sun Jian took the lead in the allied offensive but was defeated by [[Xu Rong (general)|Xu Rong]] in 191. After recovering from his losses, Sun Jian defeated [[Hu Zhen]] and captured the capital of Luoyang. Defending the devastated city however was unfeasible, so he retreated with the Imperial Seal in tow, and passed it down to Yuan Shu. While Sun Jian was attacking Luoyang, the alliance had already broken up, and [[Yuan Shao]]'s general [[Zhou Yu (Renming)]] attacked his base camp. Sun Jian returned and drove back Zhou Yu's army. Yuan Shu then sent him against [[Liu Biao]] in Jing Province, where Sun Jian died at the age of 37 in a skirmish near [[Xiangyang]].{{sfn|de Crespigny|2007|p=769}}\n\n{{quotation|Together we raised loyal troops, intending to bring aid to the nation.

Then he would arrive, and the men of his command respected order, and they did not dare to rob or plunder: not even chickens or dogs or vegetables were stolen. And so the people were extremely pleased, and they would all come to bring cattle and wine as a welcome to the army.{{sfn|de Crespigny|2004|p=161}}|''[[Sanguo Zhi]]''}}\n\n[[Sun Ce]], son of [[Sun Jian]], was 16 years old when his father died. His cousin, Sun Ben, whose father Sun Qiang had died in 175, took over his personal following and served under [[Yuan Shu]]. When Yuan Shu was driven to [[Jiujiang Commandery]] in 193, Sun Ce was given commission and sent south with some of his father's former troops. Sun Ce was defeated by [[Zu Lang]] and returned north the following year. He was granted another thousand troops and sent to take [[Lujiang Commandery]] from [[Lu Kang (Han dynasty)|Lu Kang]]. Although successful in his endeavor, he was not promoted as was promised by Yuan Shu. In 195 he was sent against [[Liu Yao]] in [[Yang Province]]. Sun Ce quickly took over the region and pushed Liu Yao to [[Yuzhang Commandery]]. By 197 when Yuan Shao declared himself emperor, Sun Ce had become the dominant power in Yang Province, so he rejected his former allegiance and allied himself to [[Cao Cao]]. In 198 Sun Ce invaded Lujiang Commandery and defeated [[Liu Xun (warlord)|Liu Xun]] and [[Huang Zu]]. In 200 the Administrator of Yuzhang Commandery surrendered. At this point [[Yan Baihu]] and [[Xu Gong]] rebelled, so Sun Ce returned east, killing Xu Gong. Before he could deal with Yan Baihu however, Sun Ce was ambushed and killed by Xu Gong's retainers. He was 26 at the time of death.{{sfn|de Crespigny|2007|p=765}}\n\n{{quotation|Sun Ce's wound was very bad, and he called in Zhang Zhao and others and said, \"Now China Proper is in confusion.

In 205 his officer [[He Qi]] began expanding into modern [[Fujian]] and by 208 a full commandery had been created in the area.

As [[Liu Bei]] and [[Liu Qi (Liu Biao's son)|Liu Qi]] fled south, Cao Cao requested Sun Quan's support, but Sun Quan decided to resist the northern encroachment instead and sent his generals [[Zhou Yu]] and [[Cheng Pu]] to support Liu Bei's cohort. Despite Cao Cao's overwhelming numerical superiority, his forces failed to cross the [[Changjiang]] and were defeated at the [[Battle of Red Cliff]] by an attack of fire ships from Sun Quan's officer [[Huang Gai]]. [[Cao Ren]] managed to hold onto [[Jingzhou|Jiangling]] for another year before retreating north.{{sfn|de Crespigny|2007|p=773}}\n\nLiu Qi died soon afterwards and [[Jing Province]] was split between Liu Bei and Sun Quan. While Sun Quan's forces were preparing to launch an invasion of [[Yi Province]] ruled by [[Liu Zhang (warlord)|Liu Zhang]], his general Zhou Yu fell ill and died in 209. Zhou Yu's successor [[Lu Su]] convinced Sun Quan to let Liu Bei \"borrow\" [[Nan Commandery]] in order to stabilize the situation on the western frontier. Meanwhile, Sun Quan established his capital at [[Jianye District|Jianye]], in modern [[Nanjing]]. Sun Quan's attempts to capture territory north of the [[Changjiang]] ended in failure both in 208 and in 215. However, when he demanded the \"return\" of Nan Commandery from Liu Bei in 215, and was denied, Sun Quan moved west and occupied the commanderies of [[Jiangxia Commandery|Jiangxia]], [[Changsha]], and [[Guiyang]].{{sfn|de Crespigny|2007|p=773-774}}\n\nIn 217 Cao Cao made a major attack on the south. Despite failing to achieve any real gains, Cao Cao stationed a substantial army in the area, threatening Sun Quan's territory forcing Sun Quan to act as a figurative subordinate to Cao Cao. In 219 Sun Quan's general [[L\u00fc Meng]] attacked [[Guan Yu]]'s position in Jing Province on advice from Sima Yi during Guan Yu's attack on Fan Castle. Guan Yu was caught off guard and killed while the whole province fell under Sun Quan's control. Liu Bei retaliated in 221 but failed to make any headway and the invasion was defeated by Sun Quan's general [[Lu Xun]]. In 226 Sun Quan launched attacks towards the south and annexed [[Jiaozhou (region)|Jiaozhou]]. In 229, Sun Quan declared himself emperor of Eastern Wu, creating the last of the Three Kingdoms.{{sfn|de Crespigny|2007|p=774}}\n\nFor the next 20 years, Sun Quan conducted several military campaigns in the north as well as an expedition to [[Taiwan]] in 230, but nothing ever came of these ventures. Noted for his longevity, Sun Quan was nevertheless unsuccessful as a military commander in comparison to his peers Liu Bei and Cao Cao. He died in 252 and was succeeded by his son [[Sun Liang]].{{sfn|de Crespigny|2007|p=774-775}}\n\n====Demise====\nAfter the death of [[Sun Quan]], the dynasty became paralyzed by infighting. [[Sun Liang]] assassinated his guardian [[Zhuge Ke]] under the influence of a distant relative [[Sun Jun (Three Kingdoms)|Sun Jun]]. When Sun Jun died in 256, he was succeeded by his cousin [[Sun Lin]]. In 258 Sun Liang sought to rid himself of his overseers but failed and was dethroned. He was replaced by [[Sun Xiu]], sixth son of Sun Quan, then 22 years old. Sun Xiu staged a coup against Sun Lin and seized power for himself. Sun Xiu died in 264 and was succeeded by [[Sun Hao]]. However, by this time he could do little to stop the might of the [[Jin dynasty (265\u2013420)|Jin dynasty]], which had just recently conquered [[Shu Han]]. Eastern Wu would itself be conquered in 280.{{sfn|de Crespigny|2004|chapter=8}}\n\n==Major warlords==\n[[File:Topographic 3K Map.jpg|thumb|400px|Late Eastern Han provinces and commanderies as well as nearby non-Chinese peoples]]\n[[File:3K Mapa.jpg|thumb|400px|Place names of the [[Three Kingdoms]]]]\n\n===Dong Zhuo, Li Jue, and Guo Si===\n[[Dong Zhuo]] and his brother [[Dong Min]] were born to [[Dong Junya]] (hailing from [[Lintao]], [[Longxi Commandery]]) in [[Yingchuan Commandery]]. As a youth, Dong Zhuo was reputed to possess immense strength and to carry two bows at each side. In 165 he became a major under [[Zhang Huan]]. For his service in defeating [[Qiang people|Qiang]] rebels, Dong Zhuo was promoted through the imperial ranks until he became Administrator of [[Hedong Commandery]] in the early 180s. In the summer of 184, Dong Zhuo was dispatched to take over overall operations against the [[Yellow Turban Rebellion]], however he was unsuccessful in this endeavor, and dismissed in the autumn. Dong Zhuo was then dispatched as a subordinate general under [[Zhang Wen (Han dynasty)|Zhang Wen]] against the [[Liang Province rebellion]]. In late 185, Dong Zhuo and [[Bao Hong]] defeated the Liang rebels at [[Meiyang]] in [[Youfufeng]] Commandery. However, when they gave chase to the rebel forces, they were surrounded and forced to fight their way out. Dong Zhuo disguised his army as fishermen to escape the enemy forces. When they passed by, Dong Zhuo had his men destroy the river dam, blocking the enemy's path, and securing their retreat. Dong Zhuo refused to obey a summons from Zhang Wen, whose staff officer [[Sun Jian]] recommended he execute Dong Zhuo. Dong Zhuo later served in the imperial army against another group of rebel forces laying siege to [[Chencang]] in Youfufeng Commandery. The commanding general [[Huangfu Song]] defeated the rebels without heeding any of the advice Dong Zhuo gave him. It was said that Dong Zhuo was arrogant and insubordinate.{{sfn|Crespigny|2007|p=158}}\n\nIn 189, [[Emperor Ling of Han]] died. General-in-Chief [[He Jin]] called on Dong Zhuo to support his elimination of the eunuchs from power. However, by the time he reached [[Luoyang]], He Jin had already been killed by the eunuchs, who were in turn killed by the guards. On 25 September, 189, Dong Zhuo took possession of the emperor [[Liu Bian]] and his brother [[Liu Xie]], establishing his puppet regime in Luoyang. On 28 September he forced Liu Bian to abdicate in favor of his brother Liu Xie. Then he killed Liu Bian a few days later. In the spring of 190 the governors in the east formed a coalition and led a [[Campaign against Dong Zhuo]]. Pressured by the enemy alliance, Dong Zhuo moved the court west to [[Chang'an]] in the summer after plundering Luoyang. In the spring of 191 Luoyang was captured by [[Yuan Shu]]'s general Sun Jian. On 22 May, 192, Dong Zhuo was killed by [[Wang Yun (Han dynasty)|Wang Yun]] and [[L\u00fc Bu]], who were soon overthrown by Dong Zhuo's former officers, [[Li Jue (Han Dynasty)|Li Jue]], [[Guo Si]] and [[Fan Chou]].{{sfn|de Crespigny|2007|p=158}}\n\nIn 194 there was a brief war with [[Ma Teng]] and [[Han Sui]] who were defeated by Guo Si and Fan Chou. In 195 Li Jue killed Fan Chou and took over his troops. Guo Si turned on Li Jue and infighting between them went on for months until a ceasefire was called. In the confusion of the conflict, the emperor was able to escape Chang'an and fled east with the help of several supporters. The emperor reached Luoyang in 196 and was then taken to [[Yingchuan Commandery]] by [[Cao Cao]]. In 197 Guo Si was killed by his officer [[Wu Xi]]. In 198 a local warlord [[Duan Wei]] killed Li Jue.{{sfn|de Crespigny|2007|p=418}}\n\n===Gongsun Du, Kang, Gong, and Yuan===\n[[Gongsun Du]] was born in Xiangping ([[Liaoyang]], [[Liaoning]]). In his early years, Du's father fled to [[Xuantu Commandery]], where Du became an office runner. Du attracted the support of the governor Gongsun Yu, whose daughter he eventually married. He rose up the ranks of officialdom in [[Ji Province]] until he became regional inspector.<ref>http://www.chinaknowledge.de/History/Han/personsgongsundu.html</ref>\n\nGongsun Du was appointed Administrator of [[Liaodong Commandery]] by [[Dong Zhuo]] in 189 on the recommendation of [[Xu Rong (general)|Xu Rong]]. As a result of his lowly origins, Du harbored an intense hatred for the elite landowning class. Once he became administrator, Du carried out his vendetta against the wealthy by publicly flogging to death the Magistrate of Xiangping and extirpating the gentry. Du dominated the northeast and expanded into the territory of [[Goguryeo]] and the [[Wuhuan]]. When Cao Cao attempted to bestow titles upon Du, he rejected them and proclaimed himself king. Du died in 204 and was succeeded by his son, [[Gongsun Kang]].{{sfn|de Crespigny|2007|p=266}}<ref>http://www.chinaknowledge.de/History/Han/personsgongsundu.html</ref> In 204 Kang expanded into Goguryeo and created [[Daifang Commandery]]. When the Wuhuan were defeated by [[Cao Cao]] in 207, [[Yuan Shang]], [[Yuan Xi]], and the Wuhuan leaders Louban and Supuyan fled to Kang. Kang killed them and sent their heads to Cao Cao.{{sfn|de Crespigny|2007|p=268}} In 208, Kang sent aid to Balgi in support of his claim to the [[Goguryeo]] throne, but was defeated by Gyesu, younger brother of [[Sansang of Goguryeo]].{{sfn|de Crespigny|2007|p=385}} However in 209 Kang invaded Goguryeo again, took its capital and forced them to submit.

Gong maintained his independence, albeit while accepting titles issued by [[Cao Pi]]. Gong became ill and was replaced by his nephew [[Gongsun Yuan]] in 228.{{sfn|de Crespigny|2007|p=267}} Yuan ruled independently until [[Sima Yi]] invaded in 238 and annexed his territory.{{sfn|de Crespigny|2007|p=271}}\n\n===Gongsun Zan===\n[[Gongsun Zan]] was born to a family of high officials and received education from [[Lu Zhi (Han dynasty)|Lu Zhi]] and [[Liu Kuan]], in the process becoming friends with [[Liu Bei]]. He took office as a local officer in [[Liaoxi Commandery]], where the administrator was so impressed with his appearance and booming voice that he gave his daughter to him in marriage. Later on, Zan became assistant magistrate of a county in [[Liaodong Commandery]] and made a name for himself fighting the [[Wuhuan]] and [[Xianbei]]. He was particularly known for leading a unit of mounted archers who only rode white horses. It was said that he was so well known among the Xianbei that they used his image for target practice. Despite Zan's success in halting Xianbei raids on Han territory, he was dismissed for losing a large portion of his men in an attack against numerically superior forces. Zan was eventually reappointed and given command of Wuhuan auxiliaries in 187 to deal with the [[Liang Province rebellion]]. For his service he was promoted to Commandant of Cavalry and went on to defeat the rebels [[Zhang Ju]], [[Zhang Chun]], and the Wuhuan chieftain [[Qiuliju]] in 188. However Qiuliju escaped and surrendered to the governor of [[You Province]], [[Liu Yu (warlord)|Liu Yu]]. Liu Yu was rewarded with rank and enfeoffment, making Zan resentful of him.{{sfn|de Crespigny|2007|pp=271-272}}\n\nWhen [[Dong Zhuo]] took power, he made Gongsun Zan a general in charge of Ji county in [[Guangyang Commandery]] under [[Liu Yu (warlord)|Liu Yu]], who became Grand Marshal. In 191 Zan defeated a group of [[Yellow Turbans]] moving north from the [[Shandong Peninsula]]. His cousin [[Gongsun Yue]] died in the hands of [[Yuan Shao]] while on a mission to [[Yuan Shu]], making the two enemies. He then seized a part of [[Ji Province]] but was badly defeated the next year. Recouping his losses, Zan defeated an invasion by Cui Juye and sent [[Tian Kai]] to invade [[Qing Province]], which was also defeated. In 193 a truce was arranged, but Yuan Shao's ally Liu Yu attacked Zan anyways, and was defeated and killed. In 195 insurgents led by [[Xianyu Fu]] and [[Yan Rou]] removed Zan from power with the assistance of Yuan Shao's troops. Zan retreated to Yi city where he secluded himself with his harem. He managed to repulse one attack by [[Qu Yi]] before Yuan Shao brought his main army in 198 and laid siege to the city. Zan sent his son Xu to seek aid from [[Zhang Yan (Han dynasty)|Zhang Yan]], leader of the [[Heishan bandits]]. However by the time reinforcements arrived, Yuan Shao's sappers had already breached Zan's fortifications and Zan killed himself and his family rather than surrender. Gongsun Xu was later killed by the Tuge tribe of the [[Xiongnu]].{{sfn|de Crespigny|2007|p=271, 272}}\n\n===Kong Rong===\n[[Kong Rong]] was a descendant of [[Confucius]] born in 153 to a minor government official, [[Kong Zhou]], in [[Lu Commandery]]. As the sixth child Kong Rong showed great wit and harbored aspirations beyond his age. In 169, the reformist Zhang Jian fled the court in fear of the eunuchs and sought refuge at the Kong estate. Kong Rong hid him from the authorities until he left, but they came back later and arrested Kong Rong as well as his brother Kong Bao. Kong Bao claimed responsibility, arguing that Zhang Jian initially sought his aid while his brother only acted as the agent. He was executed.{{sfn|de Crespigny|2007|p=389}}\n\nIn the late 170s, Kong Rong joined the offices of [[Yang Ci]], from which position he fought the influence of the palace eunuchs. In 184, Kong Rong sought an audience with [[He Jin]], who gave him employment in the Imperial Censorate. Kong Rong resigned from his position on grounds of disagreements with the head of the Censorate, [[Zhao She]]. Later he became General of the Household in charge of the palace guards.{{sfn|de Crespigny|2007|p=392}}\n\nWhen [[Dong Zhuo]] took power in 189, Kong Rong opposed the deposition of [[Liu Bian]]. As a result, Kong Rong was demoted and sent to deal with [[Beihai Commandery]], which was experiencing serious troubles with banditry. As Chancellor of [[Beihai Commandery]], Kong Rong sought to restore order by settling the people and building schools. However he was criticized as pretentious and ineffectual, having done little to deal with the [[Yellow Turbans]] and local bandits. In 193 he was attacked by the bandit leader [[Guan Hai]]. Kong Rong sent his subordinate [[Taishi Ci]] to seek aid from [[Liu Bei]]. Liu Bei sent a relief force and scattered the bandit army. In 196 [[Yuan Shao]]'s son [[Yuan Tan]] attacked Beihai Commandery, but Kong Rong had made no preparations, and instead spent his time in literary pursuits. When Yuan Tan captured Beihai Commandery, Kong Rong fled to [[Cao Cao]], who made him Court Architect. Kong Rong constantly demeaned Cao Cao's achievements and made fun of him but was tolerated due to his popularity at court. In 208 Kong Rong finally went too far and was killed for ridiculing Cao Cao in a self-righteous manner. His son and daughter were also executed.{{sfn|de Crespigny|2007|p=329-393}}\n\n===Liu Biao===\n[[Liu Biao]], a distant descendant of [[Emperor Jing of Han]], was born in 142 in [[Shanyang Commandery]]. As a child, he studied under the Administrator of [[Nanyang Commandery]], [[Wang Chang (Three Kingdoms)|Wang Chang]]. In the 160s, Liu Biao joined the reformist faction at the [[Taixue]] of [[Luoyang]]. As a result, he was ousted from office in 169. When the Great Proscription came to an end in 184, Liu Biao was reinstated as a clerk in the offices of General-in-Chief [[He Jin]].{{sfn|de Crespigny|2007|p=485}}\n\nIn 190, [[Sun Jian]] killed [[Wang Rui (civil servant)|Wang Rui]], the Inspector of [[Jing Province]]. Liu Biao was appointed the new Inspector of [[Jing Province]], but [[Yuan Shu]] was already in control of [[Nanyang Commandery]], so he went further south and set up base in [[Xiangyang]]. He was attacked by Sun Jian in 191, but Sun Jian died almost immediately after in a skirmish. In the late 190s a rebellion by [[Zhang Xiu (warlord)|Zhang Xiu]] disrupted Liu Biao's territory until Zhang Xiu died in 200. He gave refuge to [[Liu Bei]], who urged him to attack [[Cao Cao]] in 207, but Liu Biao declined. In 208 Liu Biao was invaded by Cao Cao in the north and [[Sun Quan]] in the south. Liu Biao died that autumn and his son [[Liu Zong]] surrendered to Cao Cao.{{sfn|de Crespigny|2007|p=538}}\n\n===Liu Yan and Liu Zhang===\n[[Liu Yan (Han dynasty warlord)|Liu Yan]] was a descendant of [[Liu Yu, Prince of Lu|Liu Yu]], the fifth son of [[Emperor Jing of Han]]. Seeking to distance himself from the turmoil at the capital, Liu Yan sought and received appointment as Governor of [[Yi Province]] in 188. He set his headquarters at [[Mianzhu]] in [[Guanghan Commandery]]. Soon after he raised troops in the name of [[Dong Zhuo]] and appointed the sect leaders [[Zhang Lu (Han Dynasty)|Zhang Lu]] and [[Zhang Xiu (warlord)|Zhang Xiu]] as officers. They were sent to attack [[Su Gu]], the Administrator of [[Hanzhong Commandery]], who defied Liu Yan. After Su Gu was defeated, Zhang Lu took Hanzhong Commandery for himself and eliminated Zhang Xiu. Liu Yan recruited troops from migrants and refugees from [[Central China]], creating a unit known as the [[Dongzhou Troops]] (\u6771\u5dde\u5175 ''dongzhoubing''). The Administrator of [[Jianwei Commandery]], [[Ren Qi]] and loyalist [[Jia Long]] attacked Liu Yan in 191, but they were defeated and killed. After moving his capital to Luo city, also in Guanghan, Liu Yan formed an alliance with [[Ma Teng]] in 194 and attacked [[Li Jue (Han Dynasty)|Li Jue]]'s regime in [[Chang'an]]. The campaign ended in failure and Liu Yan's sons Fan and Dan died in the attempt. Liu Yan died the same year after having moved his capital to [[Chengdu]] in [[Shu Commandery]], where his son [[Liu Zhang (warlord)|Liu Zhang]] succeeded him.{{sfn|de Crespigny|2007|p=572-573}}\n\nLiu Zhang put down an insurrection caused by Hu Mao, an agent of the Chang'an regime. In 200 Zhang Lu openly defied Liu Zhang, who in retaliation killed Zhang Lu's mother, who had been staying at his court as hostage. Zhang Lu invaded Liu Zhang's territory, occupying northern [[Ba Commandery]]. A follower of Liu Zhang also rebelled at this time due to grievances with the Dongzhou Troops, but he was defeated and killed. After [[Cao Cao]]'s defeat at the [[Battle of Red Cliffs]] in 208, Liu Zhang formed an alliance with [[Liu Bei]]. When Cao Cao's general [[Zhong Yao]] was sent against Zhang Lu in 211, Liu Zhang invited Liu Bei to Guanghan hoping that someone from the same imperial clan would help him. Liu Bei spent the next year complaining about the lack of supplies, then turned on Liu Zhang, killed his officers, and waged war on him. By 214 Liu Bei's forces had advanced to Chengdu, where a siege lasting several weeks occurred before Liu Zhang surrendered. Liu Zhang was exiled to [[Jing Province]] where he eventually entered the court of [[Sun Quan]] when his general [[L\u00fc Meng]] defeated [[Guan Yu]] in 219.{{sfn|de Crespigny|2007|p=588}}\n\n===L\u00fc Bu===\n[[File:5.3ktallhorse.jpg|thumb|Bronze horse (5.3 foot tall) from Three Kingdoms era tomb]]\n{{quotation|L\u00fc Bu was skilled in horse archery, possessing strength surpassing others, and was called the Flying General...

In 190 L\u00fc Bu was sent to plunder the tombs of [[Luoyang]]. His behavior was unruly and disruptive to his unit, causing his commander [[Hu Zhen]] to suffer defeat at the hands of [[Sun Jian]]. L\u00fc Bu was also defeated and driven from Luoyang. Conflict between Dong Zhuo and L\u00fc Bu soon came to a head and in 192 L\u00fc Bu conspired with [[Wang Yun (Han dynasty)|Wang Yun]] to kill Dong Zhuo. After ambushing and killing Dong Zhuo, Wang Yun's government was toppled by [[Li Jue (Han Dynasty)|Li Jue]] in less than a month and L\u00fc Bu was forced to flee to [[Yuan Shu]] but was turned away because of the unruly behavior of his men. Next L\u00fc Bu visited [[Zhang Yang (warlord)|Zhang Yang]] and then left when Li Jue offered a price for his head. In 193 he participated in [[Yuan Shao]]'s campaign against the [[Black Mountain bandits]]. Once again the brutality of his men caused upset and Yuan Shao sent L\u00fc Bu back to Luoyang while ordering the escort to kill L\u00fc Bu. L\u00fc Bu managed to avoid assassination and fled. In 194 L\u00fc Bu joined [[Zhang Chao]] and [[Zhang Miao]]'s rebellion against [[Cao Cao]] in [[Yan Province]]. While initially successful, the rebel forces failed to take [[Puyang]] in [[Dong Commandery]], and the tide turned against them. By the summer of 195 L\u00fc Bu was forced to flee again, this time to [[Liu Bei]] in [[Xu Province]]. In 196 Yuan Shu attacked Liu Bei. L\u00fc Bu switched sides, capturing Liu Bei's assets in [[Xiapi Commandery]], and taking his surrender. After defeating Liu Bei, L\u00fc Bu turned on Yuan Shu and drove back his army. The defeated Liu Bei later fled to Cao Cao, who in 198 sent [[Xiahou Dun]] to assist Liu Bei against L\u00fc Bu. L\u00fc Bu was unable to coordinate his commanders, who acted separately, and was driven back to Xiapi Commandery where his officers eventually betrayed him, opening the gates for the opposing army. When L\u00fc Bu tried to persuade Cao Cao to accept him as a subordinate, Liu Bei argued against it.

He ruled from his capital [[Long Bi\u00ean]] ([[Luy L\u00e2u]]) in modern [[Hanoi]] and brought prosperity to the region, taking in many refugees from the north. His brothers Yi, Wei, and Wu administered the commanderies of Hepu, Jiuzhen, and Nanhai respectively.{{sfn|Taylor|2013|p=28}}{{sfn|de Crespigny|2007|p=739}}\n\nIn 192, the southernmost district of [[Rinan Commandery]], [[T\u01b0\u1ee3ng L\u00e2m|Xianglin]], broke away and became the Kingdom of [[L\u00e2m \u1ea4p]], otherwise known as [[Champa]].{{sfn|Taylor|1983|p=47}} Aside from this incident, Shi Xie's realm was relatively secluded from the state of endemic warfare and turmoil to the north.

Shi Xie played no further role in the military affairs of the warlord states.{{sfn|Taylor|1983|p=56}}\n\nWhen Shi Wu died in 200, the Shi family lost control of the [[Pearl River (China)|Pearl River]] region, but Shi Xie contented himself with ruling the reduced portion of Jiaozhi. Shi Xie was well disposed towards the northern warlords and acquiesced to [[Sun Quan]]'s chosen Inspector of Jiaozhi, [[Bu Zhi]], who visited [[Nanhai Commandery]] in 211. Shi Xie then sent his son Xin to Sun Quan as hostage in 217. Reduced to only [[Jiaozhi Commandery]], Shi Xie died in 226 at the age of 90. His son [[Shi Hui (Three Kingdoms)|Shi Hui]] was given the post of prefect in [[Jiuzhen Commandery]] while Chen Shi became prefect of Jiaozhi Commandery. At this point Sun Quan's agent, [[L\u00fc Dai]], decided to split Jiaozhou in half with the northern portion ([[Guangzhou]]) assigned to himself and the southern half, the new Jiaozhou, to [[Dai Liang]]. Shi Hui refused to let Dai Liang into the province and decided to rebel. His officials opposed him in rebelling against Sun Quan and laid siege to him in his capital, however they were unable to breach the city gates and were eventually forced to make peace. L\u00fc Dai contacted Shi Hui's cousin and sent him with an offer of clemency on the condition that Shi Hui surrender peacefully. Shi Hui accepted the offer and together with his brothers and sons surrendered.

The exact circumstances of Yuan Shao's  birth and lineage are not clear but it's said that he was the son of Yuan Feng by a concubine, who then chose to adopt the lineage of his uncle [[Yuan Cheng]] (who lacked an heir). This was a source of contention between Shao and his half brother [[Yuan Shu]], who was the son of Feng and his chief wife, making him senior to Shao within the Feng family. However, because Shao was adopted into the family of Feng's elder brother Cheng, he became the senior cousin, and higher up in the Yuan hierarchy than Shu. Envious of Shao's greater prestige and popularity, Shu referred to him as \"our family slave\" and claimed that Shao was not a true member of the Yuan clan.{{sfn|de Crespigny|2007|p=1009-1010}}\n\nYuan Shao grew to be a handsome young man and a popular leader among his peers in [[Luoyang]]. At some point, he and [[Cao Cao]] raided a wedding, but after Cao Cao kidnapped the bride, he directed the pursuers to Shao. In the late 160s, Shao, then in his 20s, aided the reformist faction in escaping persecution by the eunuchs. After that he received appointment as a county magistrate in [[Dong Commandery]]. He then left office for six years to mourn the death of his adoptive mother and father. Upon returning to Luoyang, Shao entered the service of the Imperial Censorate, and rose through the ranks until he became a colonel in the imperial corps of the Western Garden by 188.{{sfn|de Crespigny|2007|p=1010}}\n\nFollowing the death of [[Emperor Ling of Han]] in 189, Yuan Shao urged [[He Jin]] to destroy the eunuchs. When He Jin was killed, Shao led a massacre of the eunuchs. After [[Dong Zhuo]] came to power, Shao fled east and formed a coalition army to embark on a [[Campaign against Dong Zhuo]]. Based in [[Suanzao]] in [[Chenliu Commandery]], the coalition army met with little success throughout 190, so in 191 Shao took over [[Ji Province]] from [[Han Fu (warlord)|Han Fu]]. When the coalition dissolved, Shao sent men against Yuan Shu's officer [[Sun Jian]] in [[Yingchuan Commandery]]. [[Gongsun Zan]] attacked Shao but was defeated at [[Battle of Jie Bridge|Jie Bridge]] between [[Julu Commandery|Julu]] and [[Qinghe County, Hebei|Qinghe]] commanderies. Shao set his capital at the city of [[Ye (Hebei)]] in [[Wei Commandery]]. In 193 Shao attacked the [[Black Mountain bandits]] and forced them into hiding. In 195, [[Zang Hong]] rebelled against Shao but was defeated and sentenced to death. Shao's follower Chen Rong criticized him of dishonorable conduct and was executed as well.{{sfn|Crespigny|2007|p=75}} With the support of the [[Wuhuan]], he made the final attack on Gongsun Zan in 198 and eliminated him the beginning of next year.

His army scattered and fled. Shao became ill and died in 202. He was succeeded by his son [[Yuan Shang]].{{sfn|de Crespigny|2007|p=1011}}\n\nCao Cao attacked in the autumn. By the summer of 203 Yuan Shang had been defeated and driven back to Ye, however Cao Cao decided to withdraw at this point. Shang came into open conflict with his brother [[Yuan Tan]], who fled east. In 204 Shang besieged his brother at [[Pingyuan Commandery]] but Cao Cao moved against him at Ye and forced him to flee to [[Zhongshan Commandery]] where Tan attacked him. Shang fled again to his other brother [[Yuan Xi]] in [[You Province]] while Cao Cao attacked Tan at [[Nanpi]] in [[Bohai Commandery]] and killed him. In 205 Shang and Xi were ejected from their territory by mutineers and fled to the [[Wuhuan]] under [[Tadun]], but Tadun was defeated by Cao Cao at the [[Battle of White Wolf Mountain]] in 207.

When [[Dong Zhuo]] took over, Yuan Shu fled to [[Nanyang Commandery]]. His army took part in the [[Campaign against Dong Zhuo]] under [[Sun Jian]]'s command, but when Sun Jian returned from [[Luoyang]], Yuan Shao became hostile and sent [[Zhou Ang]] against him. Yuan Shu allied with [[Gongsun Zan]] while his half brother allied with [[Liu Biao]]. Sun Jian soon died in a skirmish while on campaign against Liu Biao so Yuan Shu withdrew east to [[Chenliu Commandery]] where he was driven away as well by [[Cao Cao]] in 193. He then retreated to [[Shouchun]] in [[Jiujiang Commandery]]. The next year Yuan Shu sent [[Wu Jing (Han dynasty)|Wu Jing]] against Governor of [[Yang Province]], [[Liu Yao]], with the extra help of [[Sun Ce]] in 195.

Zhang Yang tried to seize Shangdang Commandery for himself. While he failed to oust the commandery's Administrator, he  managed to gather several thousand followers while plundering the local counties. When the coalition against [[Dong Zhuo]] formed, he attempted to join it, but his partner the wandering Xiongnu mercenary [[Yufuluo]] forced him to attack [[Yuan Shao]] instead. They were defeated at the city of [[Ye (Hebei)|Ye]]. After that Zhang Yang received commission from Dong Zhuo as Administrator of [[Henei Commandery]], so he based himself at Yewang across the [[Yellow River]] from [[Luoyang]]. In 192 and 193 he gave refuge to [[L\u00fc Bu]]. When [[Cao Cao]] attacked L\u00fc Bu at [[Xiapi]] in 198, Zhang Yang attempted to strike Cao Cao from the rear, but was killed by his own officer [[Yang Chou]], who held a grudge against L\u00fc Bu. After he defected to Cao Cao, Yang Chou was in turn killed by another officer Sui Gu who then attempted to seek help from Yuan Shao.

Gao Gan surrendered to Cao Cao in 204 but felt unsatisfied with his new position as Inspector of Bing Province. In 205, Gao Gao seized [[Shangdang Commandery]] and invaded Hedong Commandery. Gao Gan failed to take [[Ye (Hebei)|Ye]] and was driven back. In 206, Cao Cao personally led an attack on Gao Gao, forcing him to flee to the Xiongnu and then to the south in [[Jing Province]], where he was captured and killed.{{sfn|de Crespigny|2007|p=241}}\n\n===Han Fu===\n[[Han Fu (warlord)|Han Fu]] was appointed Governor of [[Ji Province]] in 189.

The official Shi Qian accused Wei Yin and Liu Chong of impiety. An official inquiry was carried out which resulted in the arrest of both Shi Qian and Wei Yin. They were both executed and no further investigation of Liu Chong occurred. Liu Chong was said to be a fine shot with the crossbow and had written a treatise on the weapon called the ''Nushe bifa''. When the [[Yellow Turban Rebellion]] broke out in 184, he raised several thousand archers and brought them to the capital where his presence quelled any unrest. In 190, he formed an alliance with [[Dong Zhuo]] and styled himself General Who Supports Han while his Chancellor Luo Jun maintained his territory in Chen Commandery. When [[Yuan Shu]]'s request for supplies was denied by Luo Jun in 197, he sent assassins who killed both Luo Jun and Liu Chong.{{sfn|de Crespigny|2007|p=494}}\n\n===Liu Yao===\n[[Liu Yao (warlord)|Liu Yao]], son of Liu Yu and nephew of [[Liu Chong (Prince Min of Chen)|Liu Chong]], was born in 157 in [[Donglai Commandery]].

His government was praised by the people and he received regular tribute from the non-Chinese. In 184, he was sent as Chancellor to [[Ganling]], where his record of humane rule settled the hotbed of [[Yellow Turban]] discontent. In 188, he was sent back to [[You Province]]. As Governor, he persuaded the [[Wuhuan]] chieftain [[Qiuliju]] to surrender and murdered the rebel [[Zhang Chun]]. [[Yuan Shao]] suggested that he be made regent instead of [[Dong Zhuo]] or even take the throne for himself, but Liu Yu declined. Under Liu Yu's governorship, You Province prospered as a result of policies encouraging silk production, market trading, and production of salt and iron. The province's prosperity and low grain prices attracted many southern refugees. In 191 Liu Yu allied with Yuan Shao, and [[Gongsun Zan]] with [[Yuan Shu]]. In 193 Liu Yu attempted to oust Gongsun Zan, who had built a fortified camp within the walls of his capital in [[Guangyang Commandery]], but failed.

His mother raised him working as a silk seller. After working as a clerk in his local county office, Zhu Jun joined the commandery staff, where he spent almost 20 years before becoming Registrar to the Adminsitrator Yin Duan. In 173, Yin Duan was reported by provincial authorities for failing to defeat the rebel Xu Chang, but Zhu Jun intercepted the letter, resulting in a reduced sentence for Yin Duan. Zhu Jun went on to become a magistrate in [[Donghai Commandery]] before he was sent to [[Jiaozhi]] in 181 as Inspector to deal with a rebellion by Liang Long. He raised 5,000 troops from his home in [[Kuaiji Commandery]] and defeated the rebellion within a matter of weeks. Zhu Jun was recalled to the capital and promoted to Counsellor Remonstrant. In 184, Zhu Jun and [[Huangfu Song]] were sent to deal with the [[Yellow Turban Rebellion]] in the south. They experienced some setbacks but managed to pacify [[Yingchuan Commandery|Yingchuan]], [[Runan Commandery|Runan]], and [[Chen Commandery|Chen]] commanderies by autumn.

In the following year, he was defeated by Dong Zhuo's commanders [[Guo Si]] and [[Li Jue (Han dynasty)|Li Jue]]. He returned to the imperial court after Dong Zhuo's assassination and served until 195 when he was taken captive by Guo Si, who had by then broken out in open conflict with Li Jue.

They failed to take Chang'an again in 189. Wang Guo was deposed and the rebel forces split up into three groups: Han Sui in Jincheng Commandery, [[Ma Teng]] in [[Longxi Commandery]], and [[Song Jian]] on the upper [[Yellow River]]. He initially supported [[Dong Zhuo]] and his successor [[Li Jue (Han Dynasty)|Li Jue]], but turned on them in 194 when he joined Ma Teng in attacking Chang'an. They were defeated at [[Changping Slope]] northwest of Chang'an and Han Sui was forced to withdraw to [[Youfufeng Commandery]]. Han Sui fell out with Ma Teng, possibly due to the machinations of Cao Cao's agent [[Zhong Yao]], and they began to skirmish with Ma Teng taking the heavier losses, causing him to join [[Cao Cao]]. In 210 Han Sui defeated [[Zhang Meng (warlord)|Zhang Meng]] in [[Wuwei Commandery]]. In 211 Cao Cao sent troops against [[Zhang Lu (Han Dynasty)|Zhang Lu]]. Believing that this was a preliminary attack on themselves, Han Sui and [[Ma Chao]] forged an alliance and confronted the enemy troops with initial success, driving them away. Later, Cao Cao personally led an army against the western alliance. When the three armies met at [[Huayin]], Han Sui attempted to negotiate with Cao Cao and talked of the old days when they were friends at Luoyang, but Cao Cao's replies were mixed. The two sides agreed on a day to do battle. Han Sui and Ma Chao were defeated and forced to retreat. In 214 [[Xiahou Yuan]] drove Han Sui from [[Hanyang Commandery]].

When [[Dong Zhuo]] retreated to [[Chang'an]], he persuaded Ma Teng and [[Han Sui]] to assist him against the other warlords. Ma Teng continued his allegiance to the Chang'an regime for a time even after Dong Zhuo's death and usurpation by [[Li Jue (Han Dynasty)|Li Jue]]. In 194, he betrayed Li Jue and attacked Chang'an with the aid of Han Sui and supporters in [[Luoyang]]. Ma Teng and Han Sui were defeated at [[Changping Slope]] northwest of Chang'an and he retreated to [[Liang Province]]. Around 197 Ma Teng began to quarrel with Han Sui and their forces engaged in battle with Ma Teng losing the exchange. His son [[Ma Chao]] was wounded in battle by [[Yan Xing (Han dynasty)|Yan Xing]] while his wife and other sons were also lost, forcing him to retreat to [[Youfufeng Commandery]]. He threw in his lot with [[Cao Cao]] in 202, sending Ma Chao to fight [[Yuan Shao]]'s officer [[Guo Yuan (Yuan Shang's subordinate)|Guo Yuan]] in [[Hedong Commandery]], and in 205 he himself campaigned against [[Sun Quan]]'s officer [[Zhang Cheng (Three Kingdoms)|Zhang Cheng]].

He then seized [[Hanyang Commandery]]. In the autumn an uprising by [[Yang Fu]] and [[Jiang Xu]] defeated Ma Chao and forced him to take refuge with Zhang Lu. Zhang Lu provided Ma Chao with troops to make an attempt to re-establish himself in Liang Province, but Ma Chao was defeated by [[Xiahou Yuan]]. Realizing that Zhang Lu would not provide him with any more troops, Ma Chao joined [[Liu Bei]], who made him a general.

Gan Ning aided Hu Mao in his conflict with Liu Zhang but they were defeated. Gan Ning fled with 800 followers to [[Liu Biao]] and then [[Huang Zu]], who treated him with disdain due to his past history as a bandit. At the [[Battle of Xiakou]] in 203, Huang Zu's fleet was defeated in an attack by [[Sun Quan]], and he himself was nearly captured until Gan Ning killed the enemy general, [[Ling Cao]], with an arrow. Despite being saved by Gan Ning, Huang Zu continued to treat his savior coldly and refused to bestow upon him any rewards or promotions. He even tried to induce Gang Ning's men to abandon him.{{sfn|de Crespigny|2007|p=239}}\n\nIn 207, Gan Ning was assigned to an eastern border post with the help of a sympathetic officer, [[Su Fei]]. From there he crossed over the border and defected to Sun Quan, where he found better terms of service.

When [[Sun Ce]] came to [[Wu Commandery]] in 195, Yan Baihu gave refuge to the displaced [[Xu Gong]] and threatened the flank of Sun Ce's army. However Sun Ce paid him no attention and the two avoided any altercations. In 197, [[Cao Cao]]'s agent Chen Yu provoked Yan into rebellion. Sun Ce sent [[L\u00fc Fan]] to drive out Chen Yu while he himself attacked Yan. The defeated Yan fled south to join [[Xu Zhao]] but died soon afterwards. Remnants of Yan's band joined Xu Gong in 200 to threaten Sun Ce's rear as he attacked [[Huang Zu]] in the west.

Liu Pi was killed.{{sfn|de Crespigny|2007|p=536}}\n\nIn 206, Sima Ju and Xu He attacked a number of cities in [[Qing Province]]. [[Cao Cao]] sent [[Xiahou Yuan]], [[Zang Ba]], and [[L\u00fc Qian]] with a large force to deal with them.

They rebelled in 179 due to unrest caused by the [[Yellow Turban Rebellion]], but when amnesty was issued by [[Cao Qian]] in 182, the rebellion was ended.{{sfn|de Crespigny|2007|p=46}} There was another brief uprising in 188 but it amounted to nothing.{{sfn|de Crespigny|2007|p=515}} Related to the Banshun were the neighboring Zong people, who became interested in the mysticism of the [[Way of the Celestial Masters|Celestial Master]] [[Zhang Lu (Han dynasty)|Zhang Lu]] and moved north to the border of his territory. When [[Cao Cao]] attacked Zhang Lu in the summer of 215, he fled to [[Duhu (town)|Duhu]] of the Zong and [[Fuhu]] of the Banshun for refuge. However Duhu and Fuhu surrendered to Cao Cao in the autumn and received appointment, with Zhang Lu following in the winter. In 219 [[Liu Bei]]'s officer [[Huang Quan (general)|Huang Quan]] attacked them and drove several non-Chinese groups north into Cao Cao's territory.{{sfn|de Crespigny|2007|p=191}} The Zong therefore became known as the [[Di (Five Barbarians)|Di people]] from Ba.{{sfn|de Crespigny|2007|p=416}}\n\n===Champa===\nThe [[Cham people]] in [[T\u01b0\u1ee3ng L\u00e2m|Xianglin]], the southernmost district of [[Rinan Commandery]], broke away and became the Kingdom of [[L\u00e2m \u1ea4p]] ([[Champa]]) in 192.{{sfn|Taylor|1983|p=47}}\n\nIn 248, L\u00e2m \u1ea4p seized Rinan Commandery.

The next year [[Xiahou Yuan]] attacked their camp in [[Wudu Commandery]] and defeated them, killing Agui and forcing Qianwan to flee. Their people were resettled in [[Youfufeng Commandery]].

The invasions, a retaliation against a Goguryeo raid in 242, destroyed the Goguryeo capital of [[Hwando]], sent its king fleeing, and broke the tributary relationships between Goguryeo and the other tribes of Korea that formed much of Goguryeo's economy. Although the king evaded capture and eventually settled in a new capital, Goguryeo was reduced to such insignificance that for half a century there was no mention of the state in Chinese historical texts.<ref name=\"byington93\">Byington, Mark E.

In 225, Meng Huo rebelled with [[Yong Kai]]. He was captured by [[Zhuge Liang]] seven times before he surrendered. Meng Huo's role was greatly expanded upon in ''[[Romance of the Three Kingdoms]]'', in which he is portrayed as the king of the Nanman and husband to [[Lady Zhurong]], a descendant of the God of Fire. In the ''Romance'', Meng Huo was described riding a red horse, wearing a golden inlaid headdress, a belt with a clasp in the image of a lion\u2019s face, boots with pointed toes that were green, and a pair of swords chased with pine amber at his waist. Later he rode into battle on a red ox, wearing rhinoceros armour while wielding shield and sword. He enlisted the aid of his fellow kings Wutugu, who commanded an army of 30,000 invincible rattan armour troops, and Mulu, who rode a white elephant and deployed wild beasts in battle. Although his allies were defeated by Zhuge Liang's anachronistic gunpowder weapons and killed, Meng Huo was repeatedly captured and released until he surrendered and became a local administrator.{{sfn|Besio|2007|p=57}}\n\n====Yong Kai====\n[[Yong Kai]] was a powerful chieftain in [[Yizhou Commandery]]. In 215, Yong Kai killed the Administrator [[Zheng Ang]] and defected to [[Sun Quan]]. Sun Quan named Yong Kai Administrator of [[Yongchang Commandery]] but actually distrusted him and ordered his officers to keep him out of that territory. In 223, Yong Kai captured the Administrator [[Zhang Yi (Junsi)|Zhang Yi]] and sent him to Sun Quan. In 225, Yong Kai was killed by another chieftain, [[Gao Ding]].{{sfn|de Crespigny|2007|p=989}}\n\n===Shanyue===\nThe [[Shanyue]] \"Mountain Yue\" were a group of [[Austro-Asiatic]] people related to the [[Vietnamese people|Vietnamese]] who lived in the mountain regions of modern [[Jiangsu]], [[Zhejiang]], [[Anhui]], [[Jiangxi]] and [[Fujian]]. In 203, they rebelled against [[Sun Quan]]'s rule and were defeated by the generals [[L\u00fc Fan]], [[Cheng Pu]], and [[Taishi Ci]]. In 217, Sun Quan appointed [[Lu Xun]] supreme commander of an army to suppress martial activities by the Shanyue in Guiji (modern [[Shaoxing]]). Captured Shanyue tribesmen were recruited into the army. In 234, [[Zhuge Ke]] was made governor of [[Danyang, Jiangsu|Danyang]]. Under his governorship, the region was cleansed of the Shanyue through systematic destruction of their settlements. Captured tribesmen were used as front line fodder in the army. The remaining population was resettled in lowlands and many became tenant farmers for Chinese landowners.<ref>http://www.chinaknowledge.de/History/Altera/yue.html</ref>\n\n===Vietnam===\nThe Three Kingdoms era was a formative period in [[Vietnamese history]]. The ruler of [[Jiaozhou (region)|Jiaozhou]] (modern [[Vietnam]] and [[Guangzhou]]), [[Shi Xie]], is primarily remembered today in [[Vietnam]] as [[S\u0129 Nhi\u1ebfp]], the father of education and a great patron of [[Buddhism]].

The Vietnamese initially opposed Shi Hui's rebellion against Eastern Wu and even attacked him for it. However, when the Wu general [[L\u00fc Dai]] betrayed Shi Hui and executed the entire Shi family, the Vietnamese became greatly upset. In 248, the people of [[Jiaozhi]] and [[Jiuzhen]] commanderies rebelled. Eastern Wu sent [[Lu Yin (Three Kingdoms)|Lu Yin]] to deal with the rebels. He managed to pacify the rebels with a combination of threats and persuasion. However the rebels regrouped under the leadership of [[Lady Tri\u1ec7u]] in Jiuzhen and renewed the rebellion with a march on Jiaozhi. According to the ''[[\u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t s\u1eed k\u00fd to\u00e0n th\u01b0]]'' (Complete Annals of \u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t), Lady Tri\u1ec7u had long breasts that reached her shoulders and rode into battle on an elephant. After several months of warfare she was defeated and killed.{{sfn|Taylor|1983|p=70}}\n\n===Wuhuan===\nThe [[Wuhuan]], a people similar to the [[Xianbei]], were a loose confederation of nomads that had been subservient to larger and stronger neighboring powers for most of their existence. In 168 the Wuhuan established some degree of independence under their own leaders. The largest of these groups were led by [[Nanlou]] in Shanggu, [[Qiuliju]] in Liaoxi, [[Supuyan]] in the Dependent State of Liaodong, and [[Wuyan]] in Youbeiping.{{sfn|de Crespigny|2010|p=229}} In 187 Qiuliju joined the rebellion of Zhang Chun.

The loose Xianbei confederacy lacked the organization of the Xiongnu but was highly aggressive until the death of their khan Tanshihuai in 182.{{sfn|de Crespigny|2017|p=401}} Tanshihuai's son Helian lacked his father's abilities and was killed in a raid on Beidi in 186.{{sfn|de Crespigny|2007|p=320}} Helian's brother Kuitou succeeded him, but when Helian's son Qianman came of age, he challenged his uncle to succession, destroying the last vestiges of unity among the Xianbei. By 190, the Xianbei had split into three groups with Kuitou ruling in [[Inner Mongolia]], [[Kebineng]] (\u8efb\u6bd4\u80fd) in northern [[Shanxi]], and Suli (\u7d20\u5229) and Mijia in northern [[Liaodong]]. In 205, Kuitou's brothers [[Budugen]] and Fuluohan succeeded him. After Cao Cao defeated the [[Wuhuan]] at the [[Battle of White Wolf Mountain]] in 207, Budugen and Fuluohan paid tribute to him. In 218, Fuluohan met with the Wuhuan chieftain Nengchendi to form an alliance, but Nengchendi double crossed him and called in another Xianbei khan, Kebineng, who killed Fuluohan.{{sfn|de Crespigny|2007|p=237}} Budugen went to the court of [[Cao Wei]] in 224 to ask for assistance against Kebineng, but he eventually betrayed them and allied with Kebineng in 233. Kebineng killed Budugen soon afterwards.{{sfn|de Crespigny|2007|p=25}}\n\nKebineng was from a minor Xianbei tribe. He rose to power west of [[Dai Commandery]] by taking in a number of Chinese refugees, who helped him drill his soldiers and make weapons. After the defeat of the Wuhuan in 207, he also sent tribute to Cao Cao, and even provided assistance against the rebel Tian Yin. In 218 he allied himself to the Wuhuan rebel Nengchendi but they were heavily defeated and forced back across the frontier by [[Cao Zhang]]. In 220 he acknowledged [[Cao Pi]] as emperor of Cao Wei. Eventually he turned on the Wei for frustrating his advances on another Xianbei khan, Sui. Kebineng conducted raids on Cao Wei before he was killed in 235, after which his confederacy disintegrated.{{sfn|de Crespigny|2007|p=289}}\n\nMany of the Xianbei tribes migrated south and settled on the borders of the Wei-Jin dynasties. In 258 [[Tuoba Liwei]]'s people settled in [[Yanmen Commandery]].{{sfn|de Crespigny|2017|p=502}} The Yuwen tribe settled between the [[Luan River]] and [[Chaoyang, Liaoning|Liucheng]].

Their last stand as a steppe empire was in 89 when [[Dou Xian]] led an army of 45,000 and decisively defeated them at the [[Battle of the Altai Mountains]]. The Xiongnu Empire was replaced by a loose confederation of disorganized [[Xianbei]] tribes, who were nonetheless highly aggressive and proved problematic to their southern neighbors.{{sfn|di Cosmo|2009|p=103}} A southern branch of the Xiongnu split off from their northern neighbors in 50 AD and continued to exist as a Han puppet state in [[Bing Province]]. However, in 188 the Xiuchuge clan rebelled against their chanyu, [[Qiangqu]], for sending troops to aid the Han against the rebels Zhang Ju and Zhang Chun. They replaced Qiangqu with his son [[Chizhishizhuhou Chanyu|Yufuluo]], whose hold on power was tenuous, and he was ousted over a marquis of the Xubu clan. When the marquis of Xubu died the next year an elderly king became the nominal head of state without the title of Chanyu and the Southern Xiongnu ceased to exist as a coherent entity.{{sfn|de Crespigny|2017|p=426}} In 216 the Xiongnu of the [[Ordos loop|Ordos]] were settled but the region remained outside the jurisdiction of [[Cao Wei]]'s administration.{{sfn|de Crespigny|2010|p=454}}\n\nYufuluo fled to the Han court but found no support after the death of [[Emperor Ling of Han]] in 189.

K. Rowling]]. The first novel in the ''[[Harry Potter]]'' series and Rowling's [[debut novel]], it follows [[Harry Potter (character)|Harry Potter]], a young [[Wizard (fantasy)|wizard]] who discovers his magical heritage on his eleventh birthday, when he receives a letter of acceptance to [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]]. Harry makes close friends and a few enemies during his first year at the school, and with the help of his friends, Harry faces an attempted comeback by the dark wizard [[Lord Voldemort]], who killed Harry's parents, but failed to kill Harry when he was just 15 months old.\n\nThe book was first published in the [[United Kingdom]] on 26 June 1997 by [[Bloomsbury Publishing|Bloomsbury]]. It was published in the [[United States]] the following year by [[Scholastic Corporation]] under the title '''''Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone'''''. It won most of the British book awards that were judged by children and other awards in the US. The book reached the top of the ''New York Times'' list of best-selling fiction in August 1999 and stayed near the top of that list for much of 1999 and 2000. It has been translated into at least 73 other languages, and has been made into a [[Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (film)|feature-length film of the same name]], as have all six of its sequels.\n\nMost reviews were very favourable, commenting on Rowling's imagination, humour, simple, direct style and clever plot construction, although a few complained that the final chapters seemed rushed. The writing has been compared to that of [[Jane Austen]], one of Rowling's favourite authors; [[Roald Dahl]], whose works dominated children's stories before the appearance of Harry Potter; and the Ancient Greek story-teller [[Homer]]. While some commentators thought the book looked backwards to Victorian and Edwardian [[boarding school]] stories, others thought it placed the genre firmly in the modern world by featuring contemporary ethical and social issues, as well as overcoming obstacles like bullies.\n\n''Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone'', along with the rest of the ''Harry Potter'' series, has been attacked by some religious groups and banned in some countries because of accusations that the novels promote [[witchcraft]] under the guise of a heroic, moral story.  Other religious commentators have written that the book exemplifies important viewpoints, including the power of self-sacrifice and the ways in which people's decisions shape their personalities. The series has been used as a source of [[wikt:object lesson|object lessons]] in [[Education#Teaching|educational techniques]], [[sociology|sociological analysis]] and marketing.\n\n==Synopsis==\n===Plot===\n<!--This section is a summary of the book and facts explicitly stated in the book, not speculation and discussion. THANK YOU FOR YOUR CO-OPERATION. This plot summary is unusually long. [[Talk:Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone/GA1]] explains what was included/excluded.

His life changes on the day of his eleventh birthday when he receives a letter of acceptance into [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]], delivered by a half-giant named [[Rubeus Hagrid]] after previous letters had been destroyed by Vernon and Petunia. Hagrid details Harry's past as the son of [[James Potter (character)|James]] and [[Lily Potter]], who were a wizard and witch respectively, and how they were murdered by the most evil and powerful dark wizard of all time, [[Lord Voldemort]], which resulted in the one-year-old Harry being sent to live with his aunt and uncle. Voldemort was not only unable to kill Harry, but his powers were also destroyed in the attempt, forcing him into exile and sparking Harry's immense fame among the magical community.\n\nHagrid introduces Harry to the [[wizarding world]] by bringing him to [[Diagon Alley]], a hidden street in London where Harry uncovers a fortune left to him by his parents at [[Gringotts Wizarding Bank]], receives a pet owl, Hedwig, various school supplies, and a wand. There, he is surprised to discover how famous he truly is among witches and wizards. A month later, Harry leaves the Dursleys' home to catch the [[Hogwarts Express]] from [[London King's Cross railway station|King's Cross railway station]]'s secret Hogwarts platform, [[Platform 9\u00be|Platform {{frac|9|3|4}}]]. On the train, he quickly befriends fellow first-year [[Ronald Weasley]] and the two boys meet [[Hermione Granger]], whose snobbiness and affinity for spells initially causes the two boys to dislike her. There, Harry also makes an enemy of yet another first-year, [[Draco Malfoy]], who shows prejudice against Ron for his family's financial difficulties.\n\nArriving at Hogwarts, the first-years are assigned by the magical [[Sorting Hat]] to [[House system|Houses]] that best suit their personalities, the four Houses being [[Gryffindor]], [[Slytherin]], [[Hufflepuff]] and [[Ravenclaw]]. Harry hears from Ron about Slytherin's dark reputation which is known to house potential dark witches and wizards, and thus objects to being sorted into Slytherin despite the Hat claiming that Harry has potential to develop under that House. He winds up in Gryffindor with Ron and Hermione, while Draco is sorted into Slytherin like his family before him.\n\nAs classes begin at Hogwarts, Harry discovers his innate talent for flying on broomsticks despite no prior experience, and is recruited into his House's team for Quidditch (a competitive wizards' sport sharing similarities to [[Association football|football]], but played on flying broomsticks) as a Seeker. He also comes to dislike the school's Potions master, [[Severus Snape]], who is also the Head of Slytherin House who acts with bias in favour of members of his House while perpetually looking for opportunities to fail Harry and his friends. Malfoy tricks Harry and Ron into a duel in the trophy room to get them out of their rooms at night and secretly tells Filch, the school's caretaker, where they will be. Hermione unintentionally is forced to come along after her failed attempts to stop them, and they find Gryffindor student [[Dumbledore's Army#Neville Longbottom|Neville Longbottom]] asleep outside the common area because he had forgotten the password to get in. After realizing the duel was a set-up to get them in trouble, they run away. They then discover a huge three-headed dog standing guard over a trapdoor in a forbidden corridor. The school's [[Halloween]] celebrations are interrupted by the entrance of a troll into the school, which enters the girls' bathroom where Hermione was. However, she is saved by Harry and Ron and, as a result, Hermione is grateful and the three become best friends. Coupled with Snape's recent leg injury as well as behaviour, the recent events prompt Harry, Hermione and Ron to suspect him to be looking for a way to enter the trapdoor.\n\nHermione forbids the boys from investigating for fear of expulsion, and instead makes Harry direct his attention to his first ever Quidditch game, where his broomstick begins to lose control and threatens to throw him off. This leads Hermione to suspect that Snape had jinxed Harry's broom, due to his strange behaviour during the match. After the excitement of winning the match has died down, Christmas arrives and Harry receives an invisibility cloak from an anonymous source claiming that the cloak belonged to Harry's father. Using the cloak to explore the school at night to investigate what is under the trapdoor, he discovers the Mirror of Erised, in which the viewer sees his or her deepest desires come true.\n\nA visit to Hagrid's hut at the foot of the school leads the trio to find a newspaper report stating there had been an attempted robbery of a Gringotts vault\u2014the same vault that Hagrid and Harry had visited when the latter was getting his school supplies. A further indiscretion from Hagrid allows them to work out that the object kept under that trapdoor is a [[Philosopher's Stone]], which grants its user [[immortality]] as well as the ability to turn any metal into pure [[gold]]. Harry is also informed by a centaur named [[Magical creatures in Harry Potter#Firenze|Firenze]] in the forest that a plot to steal the Stone is being orchestrated by none other than Voldemort himself, who schemes to use it to be restored back to his body and return to power. When the school's headmaster [[Albus Dumbledore]] is lured from Hogwarts under false pretences, Harry, Hermione and Ron fear that the theft is imminent and descend through the trapdoor themselves.\n\nThey encounter a series of obstacles, each of which requires unique skills possessed by one of the three, one of which requires Ron to sacrifice himself in a life-sized game of wizard's [[chess]]. In the final room, Harry, now alone, finds Quirinus Quirrell, the Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher, who reveals he had been the one working behind the scenes to kill Harry by first jinxing his broom and then letting a troll into the school, while Snape had been trying to protect Harry instead. Quirrell is helping Voldemort, whose face has sprouted on the back of Quirrell's head but is constantly concealed by his oversized turban, to attain the Philosopher's Stone so as to restore his body. Quirrell uses Harry to get past the final obstacle, the Mirror of Erised, by forcing him to stand before the Mirror. It recognises Harry's lack of greed for the Stone and surreptitiously deposits it into his pocket. As Quirrell attempts to seize the stone and kill Harry, his flesh burns on contact with the boy's skin and breaks into blisters. Harry's scar suddenly burns with pain and he passes out.\n\nThree days later, he awakens in the school's infirmary, where Dumbledore explains his survival against Voldemort is due to his mother's sacrificing her life in order for him to live. This left a powerful protective charm on Harry that lives in his blood, which caused Quirrell's hands to burn on contact with Harry due to him being possessed by hatred and greed. He also reveals himself as the one who sent Harry his father's invisibility cloak, while Quirrell has been left to die by Voldemort, who still lives, and the Stone has now been destroyed. The eventful school year ends at the final feast, during which Gryffindor wins the House Cup. Harry returns to Privet Drive for the summer, neglecting to tell the Dursleys that the use of spells is forbidden by under-aged wizards and witches and thus anticipating some fun and peace over the holidays.\n\n===Main characters===\n<!-- All page nums are UK p/b edition 1997; {{cite book|last=Rowling|first=J.K.|title=Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone|publisher=Bloomsbury|location=London|year=1997|isbn=0-7475-3274-5}} -->\n* [[Harry Potter (character)|Harry Potter]] is an orphan whom Rowling imagined as a \"scrawny, black-haired, green eyed and bespectacled boy who didn't know he was a wizard.\"<ref name=\"jkrbio\">{{cite web|url=http://www.jkrowling.com/textonly/en/biography.cfm| title=J.K.

According to a 1999 interview with Rowling, the character of Voldemort was created as a literary foil for Harry, and his [[backstory]] was intentionally not fleshed-out at first:\n\n{{blockquote|The basic idea... Harry, I saw Harry very very very clearly. Very vividly. And I knew he didn't know he was a wizard. [...] And so then I kind of worked backwards from that position to find out how that could be, that he wouldn't know what he was. [...] When he was one year old, the most evil wizard for hundreds and hundreds of years attempted to kill him. He killed Harry's parents, and then he tried to kill Harry\u2014he tried to curse him. [...] And\u2014so\u2014but for some mysterious reason, the curse didn't work on Harry.

Both novelists greatly encourage re-reading, because details that look insignificant foreshadow important events or characters much later in the story-line&nbsp;\u2013 for example Sirius Black is briefly mentioned near the beginning of ''Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone'', and then becomes a major character in the third to fifth books. Like Austen's heroines, Harry often has to re-examine his ideas near the ends of books. Some social behaviour in the ''Harry Potter'' books is remininiscent of Austen, for example the excited communal reading of letters. Both authors [[satire|satirise]] social behaviour and give characters names that express their personalities. However in Nel's opinion Rowling's humour is more based on [[caricature]] and the names she invents are more like those found in [[Charles Dickens|Charles Dickens's]] stories,<ref name=\"Nel2001GuideReviews\" />{{rp|13\u201315}} and [[Amanda Cockrell]] noted that many of these express their owners' traits through [[allusion]]s that run from ancient Roman mythology to eighteenth-century German literature.<ref name=\"Cockrell2004Password\">{{cite book|last=Cockrell|first=Amanda|authorlink=Amanda Cockrell|title=The ivory tower and Harry Potter|editor-last=Whited|editor-first=Lana A.|publisher=University of Missouri Press|year=2004|pages=23\u201324|chapter=Harry Potter and the Secret Password|isbn=978-0-8262-1549-9|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iO5pApw2JycC&pg=PA23 | accessdate=15 May 2009}}</ref> Rowling, like the [[The Chronicles of Narnia|Narnia]] series' author [[C.S. Lewis]], thinks there is no rigid distinction between stories for children and for adults. Nel also noted that, like many good writers for children, Rowling combines [[literary genre]]s{{nsmdns}}[[fantasy]], [[young adult fiction]], boarding school stories, ''[[Bildungsroman]]'' and many others.<ref name=\"Nel2001GuideReviews\" />{{rp|51\u201352}}\n\nSome reviewers compared ''Philosopher's Stone'' to the stories of [[Roald Dahl]], who died in 1990. Many writers since the 1970s had been hailed as his successor, but none had attained anything near his popularity with children and, in a poll conducted shortly after the launch of ''Philosopher's Stone'', seven of the ten most popular children's books were by Dahl, including the one in top place. The only other really popular children's author of the late 1990s was an American, [[R. L. Stine]]. Some of the story elements in ''Philosopher's Stone'' resembled parts of Dahl's stories. For example, the hero of ''[[James and the Giant Peach]]'' lost his parents and had to live with a pair of unpleasant aunts{{nsmdns}}one fat and one thin rather like Mr. and Mrs. Dursley, who treated Harry as a servant. However Harry Potter was a distinctive creation, able to take on the responsibilities of an adult while remaining a child inside.<ref name=\"Eccleshare2002GuidePublishing\" />\n\nLibrarian Nancy Knapp and marketing professor Stephen Brown noted the liveliness and detail of descriptions, especially of shop scenes such as [[Diagon Alley]].<ref name=\"Knapp2003InDefenseOfHP\" /><ref name=\"Brown2002MarketingForMuggles\" /> Tad Brennan commented that Rowling's writing resembles that of [[Homer]]: \"rapid, plain, and direct in expression.\"<ref name=\"Brennan2005ReviewAncientGreek\" /> [[Stephen King]] admired \"the sort of playful details of which only British fantasists seem capable\" and concluded that they worked because Rowling enjoys a quick giggle and then moves briskly forward.<ref>{{cite news|author=King, Stephen|authorlink=Stephen King|title=Wild About Harry|date=23 July 2000|work=[[The New York Times]]|url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/00/07/23/reviews/000723.23kinglt.html|accessdate=16 May 2009|url-status=live|archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20100809050706/https://www.nytimes.com/books/00/07/23/reviews/000723.23kinglt.html|archivedate=9 August 2010|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n[[Nicholas Tucker]] described the early ''Harry Potter'' books as looking back to [[Victorian literature|Victorian]] and [[Edwardian]] children's stories: [[Hogwarts]] was an old-style [[boarding school]] in which the teachers addressed pupils formally by their surnames and were most concerned with the reputations of the houses with which they were associated; characters' personalities were plainly shown by their appearances, starting with the Dursleys; evil or malicious characters were to be crushed rather than reformed, including [[Filch|Filch's]] cat Mrs Norris; and the hero, a mistreated orphan who found his true place in life, was charismatic and good at sports, but considerate and protective towards the weak.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Tucker|first=Nicholas|authorlink=Nicholas Tucker|date=December 1999|title=The Rise and Rise of Harry Potter |journal=Children's Literature in Education|volume=30|issue=4|pages=221\u2013234|doi=10.1023/A:1022438704330}}</ref> Several other commentators have stated that the books present a highly [[Social stratification|stratified]] society including many [[social stereotype]]s.<ref name=\"Fields2007HPSociologicalImagination\">{{cite journal|last=Fields|first=Joyce W.|year=2007|title=''Harry Potter'', Benjamin Bloom, and the Sociological Imagination|journal=International Journal of Teaching and Learning in Higher Education|volume=19|issue=2|pages=167\u2013177|url=http://www.isetl.org/ijtlhe/pdf/IJTLHE160.pdf|accessdate=15 May 2009|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100818204930/http://www.isetl.org/ijtlhe/pdf/IJTLHE160.pdf|archivedate=18 August 2010|df=dmy-all}}</ref> However Karin Westerman drew parallels with 1990s Britain: a class system that was breaking down but defended by those whose power and status it upheld; the multi-ethnic composition of Hogwarts' students; the racial tensions between the various intelligent species; and school bullying.<ref>{{cite book\n|last=Westman|first=Karin E.|title=The ivory tower and Harry Potter|editor-last=Whited|editor-first=Lana A.|publisher=University of Missouri Press|year=2004|pages=306\u2013308\n|chapter=Specters of Thatcherism|isbn=978-0-8262-1549-9\n|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/?id=iO5pApw2JycC&pg=PA306 | accessdate=15 May 2009\n}}</ref>\n\nSusan Hall wrote that there is no [[rule of law]] in the books, as the actions of [[Ministry of Magic]] officials are unconstrained by laws, [[accountability]] or any kind of legal challenge. This provides an opportunity for [[Voldemort]] to offer his own horrific version of order. As a side-effect Harry and Hermione, who were brought up in the highly regulated Muggle world, find solutions by thinking in ways unfamiliar to wizards. For example, Hermione notes that one obstacle to finding the Philosopher's Stone is a test of logic rather than magical power, and that most wizards have no chance of solving it.<ref name=\"Hall2003RuleOfLaw\">{{cite book|last=Hall|first=Susan|title=Reading Harry Potter|editor-last=Anatol|editor-first=Giselle Liza|publisher=Greenwood Publishing|year=2003|pages=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780313320675/page/147 147\u2013162]|chapter=Harry Potter and the Rule of Law|isbn=978-0-313-32067-5|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-__ICQemqaEC&pg=PA147|accessdate=15 May 2009|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780313320675/page/147}}</ref>\n\nNel suggested that the unflattering characterisation of the extremely conventional, [[social status|status]]-conscious, materialistic Dursleys was Rowling's reaction to the family policies of the British government in the early 1990s, which treated the married heterosexual couple as the \"preferred norm\", while the author was a [[single parent|single mother]]. Harry's relationships with adult and juvenile wizards are based on affection and loyalty.

K. Rowling]]. The first novel in the ''[[Harry Potter]]'' series and Rowling's [[debut novel]], it follows [[Harry Potter (character)|Harry Potter]], a young [[Wizard (fantasy)|wizard]] who discovers his magical heritage on his eleventh birthday, when he receives a letter of acceptance to [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]]. Harry makes close friends and a few enemies during his first year at the school, and with the help of his friends, Harry faces an attempted comeback by the dark wizard [[Lord Voldemort]], who killed Harry's parents, but failed to kill Harry when he was just 15 months old.\n\nThe book was first published in the [[United Kingdom]] on 26 June 1997 by [[Bloomsbury Publishing|Bloomsbury]]. It was published in the [[United States]] the following year by [[Scholastic Corporation]] under the title '''''Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone'''''. It won most of the British book awards that were judged by children and other awards in the US. The book reached the top of the ''New York Times'' list of best-selling fiction in August 1999 and stayed near the top of that list for much of 1999 and 2000. It has been translated into at least 73 other languages, and has been made into a [[Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (film)|feature-length film of the same name]], as have all six of its sequels.\n\nMost reviews were very favourable, commenting on Rowling's imagination, humour, simple, direct style and clever plot construction, although a few complained that the final chapters seemed rushed. The writing has been compared to that of [[Jane Austen]], one of Rowling's favourite authors; [[Roald Dahl]], whose works dominated children's stories before the appearance of Harry Potter; and the Ancient Greek story-teller [[Homer]]. While some commentators thought the book looked backwards to Victorian and Edwardian [[boarding school]] stories, others thought it placed the genre firmly in the modern world by featuring contemporary ethical and social issues, as well as overcoming obstacles like bullies.\n\n''Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone'', along with the rest of the ''Harry Potter'' series, has been attacked by some religious groups and banned in some countries because of accusations that the novels promote [[witchcraft]] under the guise of a heroic, moral story.  Other religious commentators have written that the book exemplifies important viewpoints, including the power of self-sacrifice and the ways in which people's decisions shape their personalities. The series has been used as a source of [[wikt:object lesson|object lessons]] in [[Education#Teaching|educational techniques]], [[sociology|sociological analysis]] and marketing.\n\n==Synopsis==\n===Plot===\n<!--This section is a summary of the book and facts explicitly stated in the book, not speculation and discussion.

His life changes on the day of his eleventh birthday when he receives a letter of acceptance into [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]], delivered by a half-giant named [[Rubeus Hagrid]] after previous letters had been destroyed by Vernon and Petunia. Hagrid details Harry's past as the son of [[James Potter (character)|James]] and [[Lily Potter]], who were a wizard and witch respectively, and how they were murdered by the most evil and powerful dark wizard of all time, [[Lord Voldemort]], which resulted in the one-year-old Harry being sent to live with his aunt and uncle. Voldemort was not only unable to kill Harry, but his powers were also destroyed in the attempt, forcing him into exile and sparking Harry's immense fame among the magical community.\n\nHagrid introduces Harry to the [[wizarding world]] by bringing him to [[Diagon Alley]], a hidden street in London where Harry uncovers a fortune left to him by his parents at [[Gringotts Wizarding Bank]], receives a pet owl, Hedwig, various school supplies, and a wand. There, he is surprised to discover how famous he truly is among witches and wizards. A month later, Harry leaves the Dursleys' home to catch the [[Hogwarts Express]] from [[London King's Cross railway station|King's Cross railway station]]'s secret Hogwarts platform, [[Platform 9\u00be|Platform {{frac|9|3|4}}]]. On the train, he quickly befriends fellow first-year [[Ronald Weasley]] and the two boys meet [[Hermione Granger]], whose snobbiness and affinity for spells initially causes the two boys to dislike her. There, Harry also makes an enemy of yet another first-year, [[Draco Malfoy]], who shows prejudice against Ron for his family's financial difficulties.\n\nArriving at Hogwarts, the first-years are assigned by the magical [[Sorting Hat]] to [[House system|Houses]] that best suit their personalities, the four Houses being [[Gryffindor]], [[Slytherin]], [[Hufflepuff]] and [[Ravenclaw]]. Harry hears from Ron about Slytherin's dark reputation which is known to house potential dark witches and wizards, and thus objects to being sorted into Slytherin despite the Hat claiming that Harry has potential to develop under that House. He winds up in Gryffindor with Ron and Hermione, while Draco is sorted into Slytherin like his family before him.\n\nAs classes begin at Hogwarts, Harry discovers his innate talent for flying on broomsticks despite no prior experience, and is recruited into his House's team for Quidditch (a competitive wizards' sport sharing similarities to [[Association football|football]], but played on flying broomsticks) as a Seeker. He also comes to dislike the school's Potions master, [[Severus Snape]], who is also the Head of Slytherin House who acts with bias in favour of members of his House while perpetually looking for opportunities to fail Harry and his friends. Malfoy tricks Harry and Ron into a duel in the trophy room to get them out of their rooms at night and secretly tells Filch, the school's caretaker, where they will be. Hermione unintentionally is forced to come along after her failed attempts to stop them, and they find Gryffindor student [[Dumbledore's Army#Neville Longbottom|Neville Longbottom]] asleep outside the common area because he had forgotten the password to get in. After realizing the duel was a set-up to get them in trouble, they run away. They then discover a huge three-headed dog standing guard over a trapdoor in a forbidden corridor. The school's [[Halloween]] celebrations are interrupted by the entrance of a troll into the school, which enters the girls' bathroom where Hermione was. However, she is saved by Harry and Ron and, as a result, Hermione is grateful and the three become best friends. Coupled with Snape's recent leg injury as well as behaviour, the recent events prompt Harry, Hermione and Ron to suspect him to be looking for a way to enter the trapdoor.\n\nHermione forbids the boys from investigating for fear of expulsion, and instead makes Harry direct his attention to his first ever Quidditch game, where his broomstick begins to lose control and threatens to throw him off. This leads Hermione to suspect that Snape had jinxed Harry's broom, due to his strange behaviour during the match. After the excitement of winning the match has died down, Christmas arrives and Harry receives an invisibility cloak from an anonymous source claiming that the cloak belonged to Harry's father. Using the cloak to explore the school at night to investigate what is under the trapdoor, he discovers the Mirror of Erised, in which the viewer sees his or her deepest desires come true.\n\nA visit to Hagrid's hut at the foot of the school leads the trio to find a newspaper report stating there had been an attempted robbery of a Gringotts vault\u2014the same vault that Hagrid and Harry had visited when the latter was getting his school supplies. A further indiscretion from Hagrid allows them to work out that the object kept under that trapdoor is a [[Philosopher's Stone]], which grants its user [[immortality]] as well as the ability to turn any metal into pure [[gold]]. Harry is also informed by a centaur named [[Magical creatures in Harry Potter#Firenze|Firenze]] in the forest that a plot to steal the Stone is being orchestrated by none other than Voldemort himself, who schemes to use it to be restored back to his body and return to power. When the school's headmaster [[Albus Dumbledore]] is lured from Hogwarts under false pretences, Harry, Hermione and Ron fear that the theft is imminent and descend through the trapdoor themselves.\n\nThey encounter a series of obstacles, each of which requires unique skills possessed by one of the three, one of which requires Ron to sacrifice himself in a life-sized game of wizard's [[chess]]. In the final room, Harry, now alone, finds Quirinus Quirrell, the Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher, who reveals he had been the one working behind the scenes to kill Harry by first jinxing his broom and then letting a troll into the school, while Snape had been trying to protect Harry instead. Quirrell is helping Voldemort, whose face has sprouted on the back of Quirrell's head but is constantly concealed by his oversized turban, to attain the Philosopher's Stone so as to restore his body. Quirrell uses Harry to get past the final obstacle, the Mirror of Erised, by forcing him to stand before the Mirror. It recognises Harry's lack of greed for the Stone and surreptitiously deposits it into his pocket. As Quirrell attempts to seize the stone and kill Harry, his flesh burns on contact with the boy's skin and breaks into blisters. Harry's scar suddenly burns with pain and he passes out.\n\nThree days later, he awakens in the school's infirmary, where Dumbledore explains his survival against Voldemort is due to his mother's sacrificing her life in order for him to live. This left a powerful protective charm on Harry that lives in his blood, which caused Quirrell's hands to burn on contact with Harry due to him being possessed by hatred and greed. He also reveals himself as the one who sent Harry his father's invisibility cloak, while Quirrell has been left to die by Voldemort, who still lives, and the Stone has now been destroyed. The eventful school year ends at the final feast, during which Gryffindor wins the House Cup. Harry returns to Privet Drive for the summer, neglecting to tell the Dursleys that the use of spells is forbidden by under-aged wizards and witches and thus anticipating some fun and peace over the holidays.\n\n===Main characters===\n<!-- All page nums are UK p/b edition 1997; {{cite book|last=Rowling|first=J.K.|title=Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone|publisher=Bloomsbury|location=London|year=1997|isbn=0-7475-3274-5}} -->\n* [[Harry Potter (character)|Harry Potter]] is an orphan whom Rowling imagined as a \"scrawny, black-haired, green eyed and bespectacled boy who didn't know he was a wizard.\"<ref name=\"jkrbio\">{{cite web|url=http://www.jkrowling.com/textonly/en/biography.cfm| title=J.K.

According to a 1999 interview with Rowling, the character of Voldemort was created as a literary foil for Harry, and his [[backstory]] was intentionally not fleshed-out at first:\n\n{{blockquote|The basic idea... Harry, I saw Harry very very very clearly. Very vividly. And I knew he didn't know he was a wizard. [...] And so then I kind of worked backwards from that position to find out how that could be, that he wouldn't know what he was. [...] When he was one year old, the most evil wizard for hundreds and hundreds of years attempted to kill him. He killed Harry's parents, and then he tried to kill Harry\u2014he tried to curse him. [...] And\u2014so\u2014but for some mysterious reason, the curse didn't work on Harry.

Both novelists greatly encourage re-reading, because details that look insignificant foreshadow important events or characters much later in the story-line&nbsp;\u2013 for example Sirius Black is briefly mentioned near the beginning of ''Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone'', and then becomes a major character in the third to fifth books. Like Austen's heroines, Harry often has to re-examine his ideas near the ends of books. Some social behaviour in the ''Harry Potter'' books is remininiscent of Austen, for example the excited communal reading of letters. Both authors [[satire|satirise]] social behaviour and give characters names that express their personalities. However in Nel's opinion Rowling's humour is more based on [[caricature]] and the names she invents are more like those found in [[Charles Dickens|Charles Dickens's]] stories,<ref name=\"Nel2001GuideReviews\" />{{rp|13\u201315}} and [[Amanda Cockrell]] noted that many of these express their owners' traits through [[allusion]]s that run from ancient Roman mythology to eighteenth-century German literature.<ref name=\"Cockrell2004Password\">{{cite book|last=Cockrell|first=Amanda|authorlink=Amanda Cockrell|title=The ivory tower and Harry Potter|editor-last=Whited|editor-first=Lana A.|publisher=University of Missouri Press|year=2004|pages=23\u201324|chapter=Harry Potter and the Secret Password|isbn=978-0-8262-1549-9|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iO5pApw2JycC&pg=PA23 | accessdate=15 May 2009}}</ref> Rowling, like the [[The Chronicles of Narnia|Narnia]] series' author [[C.S. Lewis]], thinks there is no rigid distinction between stories for children and for adults. Nel also noted that, like many good writers for children, Rowling combines [[literary genre]]s{{nsmdns}}[[fantasy]], [[young adult fiction]], boarding school stories, ''[[Bildungsroman]]'' and many others.<ref name=\"Nel2001GuideReviews\" />{{rp|51\u201352}}\n\nSome reviewers compared ''Philosopher's Stone'' to the stories of [[Roald Dahl]], who died in 1990. Many writers since the 1970s had been hailed as his successor, but none had attained anything near his popularity with children and, in a poll conducted shortly after the launch of ''Philosopher's Stone'', seven of the ten most popular children's books were by Dahl, including the one in top place. The only other really popular children's author of the late 1990s was an American, [[R. L. Stine]]. Some of the story elements in ''Philosopher's Stone'' resembled parts of Dahl's stories. For example, the hero of ''[[James and the Giant Peach]]'' lost his parents and had to live with a pair of unpleasant aunts{{nsmdns}}one fat and one thin rather like Mr. and Mrs. Dursley, who treated Harry as a servant. However Harry Potter was a distinctive creation, able to take on the responsibilities of an adult while remaining a child inside.<ref name=\"Eccleshare2002GuidePublishing\" />\n\nLibrarian Nancy Knapp and marketing professor Stephen Brown noted the liveliness and detail of descriptions, especially of shop scenes such as [[Diagon Alley]].<ref name=\"Knapp2003InDefenseOfHP\" /><ref name=\"Brown2002MarketingForMuggles\" /> Tad Brennan commented that Rowling's writing resembles that of [[Homer]]: \"rapid, plain, and direct in expression.\"<ref name=\"Brennan2005ReviewAncientGreek\" /> [[Stephen King]] admired \"the sort of playful details of which only British fantasists seem capable\" and concluded that they worked because Rowling enjoys a quick giggle and then moves briskly forward.<ref>{{cite news|author=King, Stephen|authorlink=Stephen King|title=Wild About Harry|date=23 July 2000|work=[[The New York Times]]|url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/00/07/23/reviews/000723.23kinglt.html|accessdate=16 May 2009|url-status=live|archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20100809050706/https://www.nytimes.com/books/00/07/23/reviews/000723.23kinglt.html|archivedate=9 August 2010|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n[[Nicholas Tucker]] described the early ''Harry Potter'' books as looking back to [[Victorian literature|Victorian]] and [[Edwardian]] children's stories: [[Hogwarts]] was an old-style [[boarding school]] in which the teachers addressed pupils formally by their surnames and were most concerned with the reputations of the houses with which they were associated; characters' personalities were plainly shown by their appearances, starting with the Dursleys; evil or malicious characters were to be crushed rather than reformed, including [[Filch|Filch's]] cat Mrs Norris; and the hero, a mistreated orphan who found his true place in life, was charismatic and good at sports, but considerate and protective towards the weak.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Tucker|first=Nicholas|authorlink=Nicholas Tucker|date=December 1999|title=The Rise and Rise of Harry Potter |journal=Children's Literature in Education|volume=30|issue=4|pages=221\u2013234|doi=10.1023/A:1022438704330}}</ref> Several other commentators have stated that the books present a highly [[Social stratification|stratified]] society including many [[social stereotype]]s.<ref name=\"Fields2007HPSociologicalImagination\">{{cite journal|last=Fields|first=Joyce W.|year=2007|title=''Harry Potter'', Benjamin Bloom, and the Sociological Imagination|journal=International Journal of Teaching and Learning in Higher Education|volume=19|issue=2|pages=167\u2013177|url=http://www.isetl.org/ijtlhe/pdf/IJTLHE160.pdf|accessdate=15 May 2009|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100818204930/http://www.isetl.org/ijtlhe/pdf/IJTLHE160.pdf|archivedate=18 August 2010|df=dmy-all}}</ref> However Karin Westerman drew parallels with 1990s Britain: a class system that was breaking down but defended by those whose power and status it upheld; the multi-ethnic composition of Hogwarts' students; the racial tensions between the various intelligent species; and school bullying.<ref>{{cite book\n|last=Westman|first=Karin E.|title=The ivory tower and Harry Potter|editor-last=Whited|editor-first=Lana A.|publisher=University of Missouri Press|year=2004|pages=306\u2013308\n|chapter=Specters of Thatcherism|isbn=978-0-8262-1549-9\n|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/?id=iO5pApw2JycC&pg=PA306 | accessdate=15 May 2009\n}}</ref>\n\nSusan Hall wrote that there is no [[rule of law]] in the books, as the actions of [[Ministry of Magic]] officials are unconstrained by laws, [[accountability]] or any kind of legal challenge. This provides an opportunity for [[Voldemort]] to offer his own horrific version of order. As a side-effect Harry and Hermione, who were brought up in the highly regulated Muggle world, find solutions by thinking in ways unfamiliar to wizards. For example, Hermione notes that one obstacle to finding the Philosopher's Stone is a test of logic rather than magical power, and that most wizards have no chance of solving it.<ref name=\"Hall2003RuleOfLaw\">{{cite book|last=Hall|first=Susan|title=Reading Harry Potter|editor-last=Anatol|editor-first=Giselle Liza|publisher=Greenwood Publishing|year=2003|pages=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780313320675/page/147 147\u2013162]|chapter=Harry Potter and the Rule of Law|isbn=978-0-313-32067-5|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-__ICQemqaEC&pg=PA147|accessdate=15 May 2009|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780313320675/page/147}}</ref>\n\nNel suggested that the unflattering characterisation of the extremely conventional, [[social status|status]]-conscious, materialistic Dursleys was Rowling's reaction to the family policies of the British government in the early 1990s, which treated the married heterosexual couple as the \"preferred norm\", while the author was a [[single parent|single mother]]. Harry's relationships with adult and juvenile wizards are based on affection and loyalty.

Writing about clinical teaching in medical schools, Jennifer Conn contrasted Snape's technical expertise with his intimidating behaviour towards students. Quidditch coach Madam Hooch on the other hand, illustrated useful techniques in the teaching of physical skills, including breaking down complex actions into sequences of simple ones and helping students to avoid common errors.<ref name=\"Conn2002ClinicalTeachers\">{{cite journal|last=Conn|first=Jennifer J.|year=2002|title=What can clinical teachers learn from ''Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone''?|journal=Medical Education|volume=36|issue=12|pages=1176\u20131181|doi=10.1046/j.1365-2923.2002.01376.x|pmid=12472752|citeseerx=10.1.1.463.8854}}</ref> Joyce Fields wrote that the books illustrate four of the five main topics in a typical first-year sociology class: \"sociological concepts including culture, society, and [[socialisation]]; stratification and [[social inequality]]; [[social institutions]]; and [[social theory]]\".<ref name=\"Fields2007HPSociologicalImagination\" />\n\nStephen Brown noted that the early ''Harry Potter'' books, especially ''Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone'', were a runaway success despite inadequate and poorly organised marketing. Brown advised marketing executives to be less preoccupied with rigorous statistical analyses and the \"analysis, planning, implementation, and control\" model of management. Instead he recommended that they should treat the stories as \"a marketing masterclass\", full of enticing products and brand names.<ref name=\"Brown2002MarketingForMuggles\">{{cite journal|last=Brown|first=Stephen|year=2002|title=Marketing for Muggles: The Harry Potter way to higher profits|journal=Business Horizons|volume=45|issue=1|pages=6\u201314 | doi=10.1016/S0007-6813(02)80004-0 }}</ref> For example, a real-world analogue of [[Bertie Bott's Every Flavour Beans]] was introduced [[Licence#Trademark and brand licensing|under licence]] in 2000 by toymaker [[Hasbro]].<ref name=\"Brown2002MarketingForMuggles\" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.timewarner.com/newsroom/press-releases/2000/02/Hasbro_Wins_Wide_Range_Rights_for_Harry_Potter_from_02-11-2000.php|title=Hasbro Wins Wide Range of Rights for Harry Potter from Warner Bros.
