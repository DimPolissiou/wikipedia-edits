The issue with the derivation is that ste\u0107ci are attributed to, for Islam, [[infidel]] Christians and Bogomils, term ''ma\u0161et'' can also be derived from Turkish ''ma\u015fatlik'' meaning \"non-Muslim cemetery\", term ''ma\u0161et'' is of male while ''ma\u0161eta'' is of female gender, which is specific for Muslims.{{sfn|Trako|2011|p=72}}}}), in Central and Western Bosnia as ''mramori'' / ''mramorje'' / ''mramorovi'' (marble), while in Serbia and Montenegro as ''usa\u0111enik'' (implantation){{citation needed|date=December  2019}}.On the ste\u0107ci inscriptions they are called as ''bilig'' (mark), ''kamen bilig'' (stone mark), ''k\u00e2m'' / ''kami'' / ''kamen'' (stone), ''hram'' (shrine), ''zlamen'' (sign), ''ku\u0107a'' (house), ''raka'' (pit), ''greb/grob'' (grave).{{sfn|Trako|2011|p=72}}{{sfn|Buturovic|2016|p=114}}{{sfn|Lovrenovi\u0107|2013|p=59\u201360}}<ref name=\"UnescoBiH\">{{cite web |url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/5607 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160820104920/https://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/5607/ |title=Ste\u0107aks - Mediaeval Tombstones (Bosnia and Herzegovina) |date=18 April 2011 |archive-date=20 August 2016 |publisher=UNESCO |access-date=1 April 2016}}</ref> In 1495 lectionary they are recorded as ''kamy'' (stone).{{sfn|Ku\u017ei\u0107|2001|p=272}}{{sfn|Bulog|2007|p=390}}\n\nAlthough under the name ''ste\u0107ak'' is meant high monolithic standing stones (i.e. ''sanduk'' and ''sljemenjak'' form), in the 20th century the word ''ste\u0107ak'' was accepted in science as general term, including for plate tombstones (i.e. ''plo\u010de'').{{sfn|Ku\u017ei\u0107|1999|p=176}}{{sfn|Mu\u017ei\u0107|2009|p=322}} The original reference to the word ''ste\u0107ak'' itself is uncertain and seems to be modern invention as it can only be traced from the note by [[Ivan Kukuljevi\u0107 Sakcinski]] from 1851,{{sfn|Ku\u017ei\u0107|2001|p=269}} dictionary by [[Vuk Karad\u017ei\u0107]] from 1852 {{citation needed|date=December  2019}}\n(in the first edition from 1812 the term did not exist), although he contradicted himself as the commoners from [[Zagvozd]] called them ''starovirsko'' (\"of the old faith\"),{{sfn|Ku\u017ei\u0107|2001|p=268}} dictionary by [[Bogoslav \u0160ulek]] from 1860 and so on,{{sfn|Ku\u017ei\u0107|2001|p=270}} while academic dictionaries mention it only from 1956/58.{{sfn|Ku\u017ei\u0107|2001|p=267}} It is considered that the term was usually used in [[East Herzegovina]] and in the area of [[Ra\u0161ka (region)|Stari Vlah]] in Serbia.{{sfn|Ku\u017ei\u0107|2001|p=268}} Until the very early 20th century there was wandering in terminology, and some scholars proposed general terms like ''nadgrobni biljezi'' (gravestone markers) and ''mramorje'' (marble) to be more appropriate.{{sfn|Ku\u017ei\u0107|1999|p=176}}\n\nThe term ''ste\u0107ak'' is uncommon in regional dialects and without [[Etiology|etiological]] value,{{sfn|Buturovic|2016|p=114}} and [[Semantics|semantically]] incorrect and contradicting as it derives from the verb \"to stand\", while the chest-type to which it refers predominantly is laid down, while another sub-type of pillars and crosses is the one predominantly upright; this upright or standing sub-type does not amount even 5% of the overall number of ste\u0107ci; in the original ste\u0107ci inscriptions they are most often called as ''kami'' (meaning \"stone\" regardless of the form), thus some scholars proposed the term ''kamik'' (pl. ''kamici'') for all forms of headstones, while ''ste\u0107ak'' would mean only the upright sub-type.{{sfn|Ku\u017ei\u0107|2001|p=271\u2013273}} The term ''kamik'' is more close to the original meaning and sometime is used instead of ''ste\u0107ak'' in professional literature.{{sfn|Lovrenovi\u0107|2013|p=60}}\n\nThe ste\u0107ci area or cemetery folk names show respect and admiration for their dimensions, age or representations: Divsko groblje (Giants\u2019 cemetery), Ma\u0161ete (big stones), Mramori/Mramorje (marble blocks), Gr\u010dko groblje (Greek cemetery), Tursko groblje (Turkish cemetery), Kaursko groblje ([[Giaour]]\u2019s cemetery).{{sfn|Lovrenovi\u0107|2013|p=59}}<ref name=\"Unesco2016\"/>\n\n==Characteristics==\n===Definition===\n[[File:Radimlja pobliz Stolce, nejvetsi nekropole stecku v BaH1.jpg|thumb|250px|Ste\u0107ci at [[Radimlja]] necropolis.]]\nThey are characteristic for the territory of present-day [[Herzegovina]], central [[Bosnia (region)|Bosnia]], [[Podrinje]] and [[Dalmatia]] (especially South of river [[Cetina]]), and some minor parts of [[Montenegro]], [[Kosovo]] and Western [[Serbia]], [[Posavina]] and Northwestern Bosnia.{{sfn|Cebotarev|1996|p=321}}\n\nSte\u0107ci are described as horizontal and vertical tombstones, made of stone, with a flat or gable-top surface, with or without a pedestal.{{sfn|Milo\u0161evi\u0107|1991|p=6, 61}}{{sfn|Cebotarev|1996|p=321}} The common classification was established by Dmitrij Sergejevski in 1952, who divided them into recumbent ste\u0107ci and standing ste\u0107ci.{{sfn|Lovrenovi\u0107|2013|p=62}} The systematization of ste\u0107ci is not currently complete. According to [[\u0160efik Be\u0161lagi\u0107]], there are seven main shapes: slab, chest, chest with pedestal, ridge/gable, ridge/gable with pedestal, pillar, and cross;{{sfn|Ku\u017ei\u0107|2001|p=271\u2013273}} while according to Lovrenovi\u0107, there are nine types in [[Radimlja]]: slab, slab with pedestal, chest, chest with pedestal, tall chest, tall chest with pedestal, sarcophagus (i.e. ridge/gable), sarcophagus with pedestal, cruciform.{{sfn|Lovrenovi\u0107|2013|p=62}}\n\nFor instance, in Bosnia and Herzegovina, according to UNESCO, \"about 40,000 chests, 13,000 slabs, 5,500 gabled tombstones, 2,500 pillars/obelisks, 300 cruciform tombstones and about 300 tombstones of indeterminate shape have been identified. Of these, more than 5,000 bear carved decorations\".<ref name=\"UnescoBiH\"/>\n\nThe chronology established by [[Marian Wenzel]] assumes they developed from the plate [[headstone]]s, the oldest one dating back to 1220 (the first were probably erected sometime in the mid-12th century<ref name=\"Unesco\"/>), the monumental ones emerged somewhere around 1360, those with visual representations around 1435&ndash;1477, and that total production ended circa 1505.{{sfn|Milo\u0161evi\u0107|1991|p=6}}{{sfn|Cebotarev|1996|p=322}} However, some consider that it lasted until the late 16th century, with rare examples that continued until the 18th century.{{sfn|Purgari\u0107-Ku\u017ei\u0107|1995|p=244}} Ste\u0107ci in the form of chest (''sanduk'') and ridge/saddle-roofed (''sljemenjak'') do not seem to have appeared before the middle or the end of the 14th century (1353-1477{{sfn|Lovrenovi\u0107|2013|p=176}}), while the remaining two basic forms - the upright pillar (''stup'') and cross (''krsta\u010da'' / ''kri\u017eina''), no earlier than mid-15th century. In the case of the latter, upright or standing forms could be influenced by the ''ni\u0161an'' - the upright monolithic stones on top of the Muslim (Turkish) graves, which had already emerged by the end of the 14th century in conquered parts of Macedonia and Serbia.{{sfn|Cebotarev|1996|p=321}}{{sfn|Lovrenovi\u0107|2013|p=69\u201371}} This form is predominantly found in Serbia and Eastern Bosnia.{{sfn|Purgari\u0107-Ku\u017ei\u0107|1995|p=244}}\n\nThe initial stage of their development, which included simple recumbent plates or slabs isn't specific for the region, but it is of broad West Mediterranean origin, and as such the term ''ste\u0107ak'' (implying the chest and ridge form) is misleading for all tombstone forms. The slabs were typical for a kind of burial in the West Mediterranean world of the 14th and 15th centuries, which had a special method of production and ornamentation in the Balkans, customized according to the stonemasonry skills and microenvironment.{{sfn|Milo\u0161evi\u0107|1991|p=6\u20137}}{{sfn|Mu\u017ei\u0107|2009|p=326}} The dated monuments indicate they were initially made by/for the feudal nobility,{{citation needed|date=December  2019}} while later this tradition was embraced and adopted by the indigenous [[Vlachs in medieval Bosnia and Herzegovina|Vlachs]] who have almost exclusively built them from the mid-15th century on.{{sfn|Lovrenovi\u0107|2013|p=72, 176}}{{sfn|Buturovic|2016|p=118}}\n\n===Decorations===\n{{quote box|width=18%|align=right|quote=\"I have for long lain here, and for much longer shall I lie\"; \"I was born into a great joy and I died into a great sorrow\"; \"I was nothing then, I am nothing now\"; \"You will be like I, and I can not be like you\"; \"May he who topples this stone be cursed\" |source=\u2014 Some translated examples of inscriptions.{{sfn|Buturovic|2016|p=121}}{{sfn|Purgari\u0107-Ku\u017ei\u0107|1995|p=249}}}}A fraction of ste\u0107ci (384{{sfn|Trako|2011|p=73}}) bear inscriptions, mostly in extinct [[Bosnian Cyrillic]] {{citation needed|date=December  2019}},some in [[Glagolitic alphabet|Glagolitic]] and [[Latin alphabet|Latin]] script.

Figural images include processions of [[deer]], [[horse]], dancing the kolo, [[hunting]], chivalric tournaments, and, most famously, the image of the [[man]] with his right hand raised, perhaps in a gesture of [[fealty]].{{sfn|Cebotarev|1996|p=322}}{{sfn|Lovrenovi\u0107|2014|p=73\u2013122}}\n\nA series of visual representations on the tombstones can not be simplistically interpreted as real scenes from the life, and symbolic explanation is still considered by the scholarship.{{sfn|Purgari\u0107-Ku\u017ei\u0107|1995|p=251}} The shield on the tombstones, usually with the crossbar, crescent and star, cannot be coat of arms, neither the lilium which is stylized is used in the heraldic sense. On one ste\u0107ak is displayed tied lion and above him winged dragon. Already in 1979, historian Had\u017eijahi\u0107 noted that the horsemen are not riding with [[rein]]s, yet (if are not hunting) their hands are free and pointed to the sky, implying possible cult significance.{{sfn|Mu\u017ei\u0107|2009|p=328}} In 1985, Maja Mileti\u0107 noted the symbolic and religious character of the ste\u0107ak scenes.{{sfn|Mu\u017ei\u0107|2009|p=329}} All the \"life scenes\" are considered to be part of ceremonial.{{sfn|Mu\u017ei\u0107|2009|p=334}} Several scholars concluded that the motifs, as well tradition of posthumous indigenous cult,{{sfn|Lovrenovi\u0107|2013|p=61}} show the continuity of old Balkan pre-Christian symbolism from [[Prehistory of the Balkans|prehistoric]] time and the autochthonous Romanized [[Illyrians|Illyrian]]{{citation needed|date=December 2019}}  (i.e. [[Vlachs in medieval Bosnia and Herzegovina|Vlachian]]) tribes.{{sfn|Mu\u017ei\u0107|2009|p=329\u2013335}} [[Alojz Benac]] noted that the displays of sole horse with snake, as well sole deer with bird, symbolize the soul of the deceased going to otherworld, which representations are resembling to those found on [[Iapydes]] artefacts.{{sfn|Mu\u017ei\u0107|2009|p=332\u2013333}} The Illyrian god ''[[Paleo-Balkan mythology#Illyrian|Medaurus]]'' is described as riding on horseback and carrying a lance.{{sfn|Mu\u017ei\u0107|2009|p=333}}\n\n[[File:Radimlje, bogumil nekropolisz s\u00edrk\u0151 7.JPG|thumb|200px|The sacral motif of deer is considered to be of [[Paleo-Balkan mythology|Paleo-Balkan]] and pre-Christian origin.]]\nOf the all animals deer is the most represented, and mostly is found on ste\u0107ci in Herzegovina.{{sfn|Mu\u017ei\u0107|2009|p=332}} According to [[Dragoslav Srejovi\u0107]], spread of Christianity did not cause the disappearance of old cult and belief in sacred deer.{{sfn|Mu\u017ei\u0107|2009|p=331}} Wenzel considered it lead the deceased to [[underworld]].{{sfn|Purgari\u0107-Ku\u017ei\u0107|1995|p=251}} Historian [[\u0160efik Be\u0161lagi\u0107]] synthesized the representations of deer: sometimes accompanied by a bird (often on the back or horns), cross or lilium, frequently are shown series of deer or doe, as well with a bow and arrow, dog and hunter(s) with a spear or sword (often on a horse).

Paradoxically, none of the these groups in Bosnia and Herzegovina, ([[Bosniaks]], [[Serbs of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnian Serbs]] and [[Croats of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnian Croats]]), originally remember them in their collective consciousness, leaving them to deteriorate in nature or to human carelessness and destruction which at least halved the number.{{sfn|Lovrenovi\u0107|2013|p=36}} This attitude alone implies how such appropriation is based on an ideological construct.{{sfn|Lovrenovi\u0107|2013|p=28\u201338, 368}} According to [[Marian Wenzel]] one of the three pervasive ethno-national ideological constructs, specifically the thesis about Bogomil origin of ste\u0107ci, dates as far back as the last decade of the 19th century when it has been put forward by [[Austro-Hungarian rule in Bosnia and Herzegovina|Austria-Hungarian]] bureaucracy, namely by a member of the Hungarian parliament Janos von Asboth, in correlation with similar thesis on origin of Muslim inhabitants of Bosnia and Herzegovina as descendants of Bogomils.<ref name=\"osvrt-tri-knjige-wenzel-kojic-1980\">{{cite journal |author1=Koji\u0107 Lj. |author2=Wenzel M. |title=Austro-Ugarska i nauka o bogumilskim ste\u0107cima: osvrt na tri inostrane knjige o ste\u0107cima |journal=Starinar |date=1980 |issue=XXXI |page=209 |publisher=Arheolo\u0161ki institut |location=Beograd}}</ref><ref name=\"bosnian-style-wenzel-1999\">{{cite book |author=Marian Wenzel |authorlink1=Marian Wenzel |title=Bosnian Style on tombstones and metal |date=1999 |publisher=Sarajevo-Publishing |location=Sarajevo |isbn=9958-21-106-8 |page=175 |edition=Biblioteka Kulturno naslje\u0111e BiH |chapter=False History of Bosnia}}</ref> Such distortion of history will later attract criticism by scholars like Wenzel, who stated that through this particular example Austria-Hungarian authority practically delivered ste\u0107ci \"as a gift to Muslims, emphasizing their inheritance rights to the land and implying that the later Christians, comparatively, were the 'newcomers'\".<ref name=\"bosnian-style-wenzel-1999\"/>{{sfn|Lovrenovi\u0107|2013|p=35}} During the war of the 1990s this theory will again have its resurgence in media and public discourse, seeking historical-political legitimacy in which Islamization of local Bosnia and Herzegovina populace was not only caused by Ottoman occupation but also by ingrained religious idiosyncrasy, epitomized in Bogomilsm, thus affirming ethnic and confessional difference between Bogomil population and population of Catholic and Orthodox confession.{{sfn|Lovrenovi\u0107|2013|p=43\u201346}} However, it did not make a significant influence on scientific thinking or scholarship and comparative research in Bosnia and Herzegovina, nor elsewhere.{{sfn|Lovrenovi\u0107|2013|p=46\u201348}}\n\nEurope's first public presentation of the gravestones is attributed to Polish-born Russian immigrant and Yugoslav diplomat, [[Alexander Soloviev (historian)|Alexander Soloviev]] (1890-1971).

The issue with the derivation is that ste\u0107ci are attributed to, for Islam, [[infidel]] Christians and Bogomils, term ''ma\u0161et'' can also be derived from Turkish ''ma\u015fatlik'' meaning \"non-Muslim cemetery\", term ''ma\u0161et'' is of male while ''ma\u0161eta'' is of female gender, which is specific for Muslims.{{sfn|Trako|2011|p=72}}}}), in Central and Western Bosnia as ''mramori'' / ''mramorje'' / ''mramorovi'' (marble), while in Serbia and Montenegro as ''usa\u0111enik'' (implantation){{citation needed|date=December  2019}}.On the ste\u0107ci inscriptions they are called as ''bilig'' (mark), ''kamen bilig'' (stone mark), ''k\u00e2m'' / ''kami'' / ''kamen'' (stone), ''hram'' (shrine), ''zlamen'' (sign), ''ku\u0107a'' (house), ''raka'' (pit), ''greb/grob'' (grave).{{sfn|Trako|2011|p=72}}{{sfn|Buturovic|2016|p=114}}{{sfn|Lovrenovi\u0107|2013|p=59\u201360}}<ref name=\"UnescoBiH\">{{cite web |url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/5607 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160820104920/https://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/5607/ |title=Ste\u0107aks - Mediaeval Tombstones (Bosnia and Herzegovina) |date=18 April 2011 |archive-date=20 August 2016 |publisher=UNESCO |access-date=1 April 2016}}</ref> In 1495 lectionary they are recorded as ''kamy'' (stone).{{sfn|Ku\u017ei\u0107|2001|p=272}}{{sfn|Bulog|2007|p=390}}\n\nAlthough under the name ''ste\u0107ak'' is meant high monolithic standing stones (i.e. ''sanduk'' and ''sljemenjak'' form), in the 20th century the word ''ste\u0107ak'' was accepted in science as general term, including for plate tombstones (i.e. ''plo\u010de'').{{sfn|Ku\u017ei\u0107|1999|p=176}}{{sfn|Mu\u017ei\u0107|2009|p=322}} The original reference to the word ''ste\u0107ak'' itself is uncertain and seems to be modern invention as it can only be traced from the note by [[Ivan Kukuljevi\u0107 Sakcinski]] from 1851,{{sfn|Ku\u017ei\u0107|2001|p=269}} dictionary by [[Vuk Karad\u017ei\u0107]] from 1852 {{citation needed|date=December  2019}}\n(in the first edition from 1812 the term did not exist), although he contradicted himself as the commoners from [[Zagvozd]] called them ''starovirsko'' (\"of the old faith\"),{{sfn|Ku\u017ei\u0107|2001|p=268}} dictionary by [[Bogoslav \u0160ulek]] from 1860 and so on,{{sfn|Ku\u017ei\u0107|2001|p=270}} while academic dictionaries mention it only from 1956/58.{{sfn|Ku\u017ei\u0107|2001|p=267}} It is considered that the term was usually used in [[East Herzegovina]] and in the area of [[Ra\u0161ka (region)|Stari Vlah]] in Serbia.{{sfn|Ku\u017ei\u0107|2001|p=268}} Until the very early 20th century there was wandering in terminology, and some scholars proposed general terms like ''nadgrobni biljezi'' (gravestone markers) and ''mramorje'' (marble) to be more appropriate.{{sfn|Ku\u017ei\u0107|1999|p=176}}\n\nThe term ''ste\u0107ak'' is uncommon in regional dialects and without [[Etiology|etiological]] value,{{sfn|Buturovic|2016|p=114}} and [[Semantics|semantically]] incorrect and contradicting as it derives from the verb \"to stand\", while the chest-type to which it refers predominantly is laid down, while another sub-type of pillars and crosses is the one predominantly upright; this upright or standing sub-type does not amount even 5% of the overall number of ste\u0107ci; in the original ste\u0107ci inscriptions they are most often called as ''kami'' (meaning \"stone\" regardless of the form), thus some scholars proposed the term ''kamik'' (pl.

According to [[\u0160efik Be\u0161lagi\u0107]], there are seven main shapes: slab, chest, chest with pedestal, ridge/gable, ridge/gable with pedestal, pillar, and cross;{{sfn|Ku\u017ei\u0107|2001|p=271\u2013273}} while according to Lovrenovi\u0107, there are nine types in [[Radimlja]]: slab, slab with pedestal, chest, chest with pedestal, tall chest, tall chest with pedestal, sarcophagus (i.e. ridge/gable), sarcophagus with pedestal, cruciform.{{sfn|Lovrenovi\u0107|2013|p=62}}\n\nFor instance, in Bosnia and Herzegovina, according to UNESCO, \"about 40,000 chests, 13,000 slabs, 5,500 gabled tombstones, 2,500 pillars/obelisks, 300 cruciform tombstones and about 300 tombstones of indeterminate shape have been identified. Of these, more than 5,000 bear carved decorations\".<ref name=\"UnescoBiH\"/>\n\nThe chronology established by [[Marian Wenzel]] assumes they developed from the plate [[headstone]]s, the oldest one dating back to 1220 (the first were probably erected sometime in the mid-12th century<ref name=\"Unesco\"/>), the monumental ones emerged somewhere around 1360, those with visual representations around 1435&ndash;1477, and that total production ended circa 1505.{{sfn|Milo\u0161evi\u0107|1991|p=6}}{{sfn|Cebotarev|1996|p=322}} However, some consider that it lasted until the late 16th century, with rare examples that continued until the 18th century.{{sfn|Purgari\u0107-Ku\u017ei\u0107|1995|p=244}} Ste\u0107ci in the form of chest (''sanduk'') and ridge/saddle-roofed (''sljemenjak'') do not seem to have appeared before the middle or the end of the 14th century (1353-1477{{sfn|Lovrenovi\u0107|2013|p=176}}), while the remaining two basic forms - the upright pillar (''stup'') and cross (''krsta\u010da'' / ''kri\u017eina''), no earlier than mid-15th century. In the case of the latter, upright or standing forms could be influenced by the ''ni\u0161an'' - the upright monolithic stones on top of the Muslim (Turkish) graves, which had already emerged by the end of the 14th century in conquered parts of Macedonia and Serbia.{{sfn|Cebotarev|1996|p=321}}{{sfn|Lovrenovi\u0107|2013|p=69\u201371}} This form is predominantly found in Serbia and Eastern Bosnia.{{sfn|Purgari\u0107-Ku\u017ei\u0107|1995|p=244}}\n\nThe initial stage of their development, which included simple recumbent plates or slabs isn't specific for the region, but it is of broad West Mediterranean origin, and as such the term ''ste\u0107ak'' (implying the chest and ridge form) is misleading for all tombstone forms. The slabs were typical for a kind of burial in the West Mediterranean world of the 14th and 15th centuries, which had a special method of production and ornamentation in the Balkans, customized according to the stonemasonry skills and microenvironment.{{sfn|Milo\u0161evi\u0107|1991|p=6\u20137}}{{sfn|Mu\u017ei\u0107|2009|p=326}} The dated monuments indicate they were initially made by/for the feudal nobility,{{citation needed|date=December  2019}} while later this tradition was embraced and adopted by the indigenous [[Vlachs in medieval Bosnia and Herzegovina|Vlachs]] who have almost exclusively built them from the mid-15th century on.{{sfn|Lovrenovi\u0107|2013|p=72, 176}}{{sfn|Buturovic|2016|p=118}}\n\n===Decorations===\n{{quote box|width=18%|align=right|quote=\"I have for long lain here, and for much longer shall I lie\"; \"I was born into a great joy and I died into a great sorrow\"; \"I was nothing then, I am nothing now\"; \"You will be like I, and I can not be like you\"; \"May he who topples this stone be cursed\" |source=\u2014 Some translated examples of inscriptions.{{sfn|Buturovic|2016|p=121}}{{sfn|Purgari\u0107-Ku\u017ei\u0107|1995|p=249}}}}A fraction of ste\u0107ci (384{{sfn|Trako|2011|p=73}}) bear inscriptions, mostly in extinct [[Bosnian Cyrillic]] {{citation needed|date=December  2019}},some in [[Glagolitic alphabet|Glagolitic]] and [[Latin alphabet|Latin]] script.

Paradoxically, none of the these groups in Bosnia and Herzegovina, ([[Bosniaks]], [[Serbs of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnian Serbs]] and [[Croats of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnian Croats]]), originally remember them in their collective consciousness, leaving them to deteriorate in nature or to human carelessness and destruction which at least halved the number.{{sfn|Lovrenovi\u0107|2013|p=36}} This attitude alone implies how such appropriation is based on an ideological construct.{{sfn|Lovrenovi\u0107|2013|p=28\u201338, 368}} According to [[Marian Wenzel]] one of the three pervasive ethno-national ideological constructs, specifically the thesis about Bogomil origin of ste\u0107ci, dates as far back as the last decade of the 19th century when it has been put forward by [[Austro-Hungarian rule in Bosnia and Herzegovina|Austria-Hungarian]] bureaucracy, namely by a member of the Hungarian parliament Janos von Asboth, in correlation with similar thesis on origin of Muslim inhabitants of Bosnia and Herzegovina as descendants of Bogomils.<ref name=\"osvrt-tri-knjige-wenzel-kojic-1980\">{{cite journal |author1=Koji\u0107 Lj. |author2=Wenzel M. |title=Austro-Ugarska i nauka o bogumilskim ste\u0107cima: osvrt na tri inostrane knjige o ste\u0107cima |journal=Starinar |date=1980 |issue=XXXI |page=209 |publisher=Arheolo\u0161ki institut |location=Beograd}}</ref><ref name=\"bosnian-style-wenzel-1999\">{{cite book |author=Marian Wenzel |authorlink1=Marian Wenzel |title=Bosnian Style on tombstones and metal |date=1999 |publisher=Sarajevo-Publishing |location=Sarajevo |isbn=9958-21-106-8 |page=175 |edition=Biblioteka Kulturno naslje\u0111e BiH |chapter=False History of Bosnia}}</ref> Such distortion of history will later attract criticism by scholars like Wenzel, who stated that through this particular example Austria-Hungarian authority practically delivered ste\u0107ci \"as a gift to Muslims, emphasizing their inheritance rights to the land and implying that the later Christians, comparatively, were the 'newcomers'\".<ref name=\"bosnian-style-wenzel-1999\"/>{{sfn|Lovrenovi\u0107|2013|p=35}} During the war of the 1990's this theory will again have its resurgence in media and public discourse, seeking historical-political legitimacy in which Islamization of local Bosnia and Herzegovina populace was not only caused by Ottoman occupation but also by ingrained religious idiosyncrasy, epitomized in Bogomilsm, thus affirming ethnic and confessional difference between Bogomil population and population of Catholic and Orthodox confession.{{sfn|Lovrenovi\u0107|2013|p=43\u201346}} However, it did not make a significant influence on scientific thinking or scholarship and comparative research in Bosnia and Herzegovina, nor elsewhere.{{sfn|Lovrenovi\u0107|2013|p=46\u201348}}\n\nEurope's first public presentation of the gravestones is attributed to Polish-born Russian immigrant and Yugoslav diplomat, [[Alexander Soloviev (historian)|Alexander Soloviev]] (1890-1971).

His interest in music began when he was 7 years old, when he started playing and experimenting with an [[electronic organ]] he had in his house. He later started taking lessons with an organist from a Polish church in Rome, New York, where he learned almost exclusively [[baroque music]]. Later in high school he learned to play other instruments, including [[bass clarinet]] and piano.<ref name=\"NecrosInterview2011\">{{cite web | url=http://necros.gibdon.com/news/interview | title=Andrew \"Necros\" Sega Interview | publisher=necros.gibdon.com | date=July 19, 2011 | accessdate=July 20, 2011 | author=Augustini, Petrit | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120717023422/http://necros.gibdon.com/news/interview | archivedate=July 17, 2012}}</ref>\n\nSega's first records were from artists such as [[Men at Work]], [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]], and [[Fleetwood Mac]]. He discovered [[Tracker (music software)|trackers]] in his first year of college (1993) from a friend who showed him [[Future Crew]]'s ''[[Unreal (demo)|Unreal]]'' demo.

He is currently part of the group [[Iris (American band)|Iris]] and a live member of Stromkern, and has his own recording label known as Diffusion Records. Sega's main solo project is known as The Alpha Conspiracy.\n\n==Biography==\nAndrew Sega was born on May 20, 1975, in [[Providence, Rhode Island]]{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} and lived the majority of his young life in Upstate New York. His interest in music began when he was 7 years old, when he started playing and experimenting with an [[electronic organ]] he had in his house. He later started taking lessons with an organist from a Polish church in Rome, New York, where he learned almost exclusively [[baroque music]]. Later in high school he learned to play other instruments, including [[bass clarinet]] and piano.<ref name=\"NecrosInterview2011\">{{cite web | url=http://necros.gibdon.com/news/interview | title=Andrew \"Necros\" Sega Interview | publisher=necros.gibdon.com | date=July 19, 2011 | accessdate=July 20, 2011 | author=Augustini, Petrit | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120717023422/http://necros.gibdon.com/news/interview | archivedate=July 17, 2012}}</ref>\n\nSega's first records were from artists such as [[Men at Work]], [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]], and [[Fleetwood Mac]]. He discovered [[Tracker (music software)|trackers]] in his first year of college (1993) from a friend, who showed him [[Future Crew]]'s ''[[Unreal (demo)|Unreal]]'' demo.

[[Major League Soccer]] (MLS), which also includes teams based in Canada, is sometimes included in a \"top five\" of leagues.

If all of Germany's and Russia's incarnations are combined, the United States slips to fourth in the all-time Winter Olympic Games table.\n\n===Amateurism and professionalism===\nThe exclusion of professionals caused several controversies throughout the history of the modern Olympics. The [[1912 Summer Olympics|1912 Olympic]] [[pentathlon]] and [[decathlon]] champion [[Jim Thorpe]] was stripped of his medals when it was discovered that he had played semi-professional baseball before the Olympics. His medals were posthumously restored by the [[International Olympic Committee|IOC]] in 1983 on compassionate grounds.<ref>{{cite web |title=Jim Thorpe Biography |publisher=Biography.com |url=http://www.biography.com/search/article.do?id=9507017 |accessdate=9 February 2009}}</ref>\n\nThe advent of the state-sponsored \"full-time amateur athlete\" of the [[Eastern Bloc]] countries eroded the ideology of the pure [[amateur sports#Olympics|amateur]], as it put the self-financed amateurs of the Western countries at a disadvantage. The [[Soviet Union at the Olympics|Soviet Union]] entered teams of athletes who were all nominally students, soldiers, or working in a profession, but all of whom were in reality paid by the state to train on a full-time basis.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.bu.edu/guidedhistory/russia-and-its-empires/tyler-benson/|title=The Role of Sports in The Soviet Union - Guided History|website=blogs.bu.edu}}</ref><ref name=\"cia.gov\">{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP80-00810A005600130009-0.pdf |title=Info |website=www.cia.gov }}</ref><ref name=\"cia.gov\"/> The situation greatly disadvantaged American athletes, and was a major factor in the decline of American medal hauls in the 1970s and 1980s. As a result, the Olympics shifted away from [[Amateur sports|amateurism]], as envisioned by [[Pierre de Coubertin]], to allowing participation of [[professional athlete]]s, but only in the 1990s, after the [[collapse of the Soviet Union]] and its influence within the [[International Olympic Committee]].\n\n==Individual sports==\n\n===Motorsports===\n{{main|Motorsport in the United States}}\n[[File:RichardPetty1985Pocono.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Richard Petty]]]]\n\nMotor sports are widely popular in the United States but Americans generally show little interest in the major international competitions, such as the [[Formula One]] Grand Prix series and [[Grand Prix motorcycle racing|MotoGP]], preferring home-grown racing series.  However, some Americans have achieved great success in these international series, such as [[Mario Andretti]] and [[Kenny Roberts]].\n\nAmericans, like the rest of the world, initially began using public streets to host automobile races, but these venues were often unsafe to the public as they offered relatively little crowd control. Promoters and drivers in the United States discovered that [[horse racing]] tracks could provide better conditions for drivers and spectators than public streets. This, in turn, was succeeded by [[board track racing]] (which was short-lived as many of the tracks were highly flammable and difficult to maintain) followed by [[oval track racing]], which remains the dominant form of racing in the United States but is not used in the rest of the world; [[road racing]] has generally waned. However, an extensive, albeit illegal [[street racing]] culture still persists.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://auto-racing.speedtv.com/article/despain-my-take-on-open-wheel-racing-in-america/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=July 22, 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517073126/http://auto-racing.speedtv.com/article/despain-my-take-on-open-wheel-racing-in-america/ |archivedate=May 17, 2008 |df=mdy }}</ref>\n\n====IndyCar Series====\n{{Main|IndyCar Series}}\n[[File:Danica Patrick 2008 Indy 500 Pole Day.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Danica Patrick]] is the most successful woman in the history of [[American Championship Car Racing|American open-wheel racing]].]]\n\nHistorically, [[American Championship Car Racing|open wheel racing]] was the most popular form of U.S. motorsport nationwide. However, an infamously acrimonious split (often referred to by many as \"The Split\") in 1994 between the primary series, CART (later known as [[Champ Car]]), and the owner of the [[Indianapolis Motor Speedway]] (the site of the Indy 500), [[Tony George]], led to the formation of the Indy Racing League, now known as [[INDYCAR]], which launched the rival IndyCar Series in 1996. From that point on, the popularity of open wheel racing in the U.S. declined dramatically.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/rpm/columns/story?seriesId=1&columnist=oreovicz_john&id=3180918 |title=American open-wheel racing held hostage: Year 13 |first=John |last=Oreovicz |work=[[ESPN.com]] |date=January 6, 2008 |accessdate=January 6, 2008}}</ref> The feud was settled in 2008 with an agreement to merge the two series under the IndyCar banner, but enormous damage had already been done to the sport.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/rpm/news/story?seriesId=1&id=3259364 |title=After 12 years of conflict, IRL and Champ Car merge |agency=Associated Press |publisher=ESPN.com |date=February 22, 2008 |accessdate=February 22, 2008}}</ref> Post-merger, IndyCar continues to run with slight viewership gains per year.

NASCAR's audience peaked in the early 2000s, and has declined quite a bit ever since the implementation of the [[NASCAR playoffs|Chase for the Cup]] in 2004, though it continues to have around 2\u20134 million viewers per race. Among NASCAR's popular former drivers are [[Jeff Gordon]], [[Dale Earnhardt]], [[Matt Kenseth]], [[Tony Stewart]], [[Dale Earnhardt Jr.]], and [[Richard Petty]]. Among NASCAR's popular active drivers are [[Jimmie Johnson]], [[Kurt Busch]], [[Kyle Busch]], [[Chase Elliott]], [[Ryan Blaney]], and [[Kyle Larson]]. NASCAR's most popular race is the [[Daytona 500]], the opening race of the season, held each year at [[Daytona Beach, Florida]] in February.\n\n====Other motorsports====\nAmong the better known [[sports car racing|sports car races]] in the United States are the [[24 Hours of Daytona]], [[12 Hours of Sebring]], and [[Petit Le Mans]], which have featured in the [[World Sportscar Championship]], [[IMSA GT Championship]], [[Intercontinental Le Mans Cup]], [[FIA World Endurance Championship]], [[American Le Mans Series]], [[Rolex Sports Car Series]] and currently the [[United SportsCar Championship]].\n\nAnother one of the most popular forms of motorsports in the United States is the indigenous sport of [[drag racing]]. The largest drag racing organization is the [[National Hot Rod Association]].\n\nSeveral other motorsports enjoy varying degrees of popularity in the United States: [[short track motor racing]], [[motocross]], [[monster truck]] competitions (including the popular [[Monster Jam]] circuit), [[demolition derby]], [[figure 8 racing]], [[mud bogging]] and [[tractor pulling]].\n\n===Golf===\n{{main|Golf in the United States}}\n[[File:JackNicklaus.cropped.jpg|thumb|left|[[Jack Nicklaus]] is widely regarded as the greatest golfer of all time, winning a total of 18 career major championships.]]\n[[File:Louise Suggs 1958.JPG|thumb|right|150px|[[Louise Suggs]] one of the founders of the LPGA Tour and thus modern ladies' golf.]]\n\nGolf is played in the United States by about 25 million people. The sport's national governing body, the [[United States Golf Association]] (USGA), is jointly responsible with [[The R&A]] for setting and administering the rules of golf. The USGA conducts four national championships open to professionals: the [[U.S. Open (golf)|U.S. Open]], [[U.S. Women's Open]], [[U.S. Senior Open]], and the [[U.S. Senior Women's Open]], with the last of these holding its first edition in 2018. The [[PGA of America]] organizes the [[PGA Championship]], [[Senior PGA Championship]] and [[Women's PGA Championship]]. Three legs of the [[Grand Slam (golf)|Grand Slam of Golf]] are based in the United States: the PGA Championship, U.S. Open and [[Masters Tournament|The Masters]]. ([[The Open Championship]], known in the U.S. as the British Open, is played in the United Kingdom.)\n\nThe [[PGA Tour]] is the main professional golf tour in the United States, and the [[LPGA|LPGA Tour]] is the main women's professional tour. Also of note is [[PGA Tour Champions]], where players 50 and older compete. Golf is aired on several television networks, such as [[Golf Channel]], [[Golf Channel on NBC|NBC]], [[Golf on ESPN|ESPN]], [[PGA Tour on CBS|CBS]] and [[Fox USGA|Fox]].\n\nNotable American male golfers include [[Walter Hagen]] (11 majors), [[Ben Hogan]], [[Jack Nicklaus]] (record 18 major wins), [[Arnold Palmer]], and [[Tiger Woods]] (15 major wins).

The pinnacle of the sport in the country is the [[US Open (Tennis)|US Open]] played in late August at the [[USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center]] in New York. The [[Indian Wells Masters]], [[Miami Open (tennis)|Miami Open]] and [[Cincinnati Masters]] are part of the [[ATP Tour Masters 1000]] and the former [[WTA Tier I]] (currently Premier Mandatory and Premier 5).\n\nThe United States has had considerable success in tennis for many years, with players such as [[Don Budge]], [[Billie Jean King]] (12 major singles titles), [[Chris Evert]] (18 major singles titles), [[Jimmy Connors]] (8 major singles titles), [[John McEnroe]] (7 major singles titles), [[Andre Agassi]] (8 major singles titles) and [[Pete Sampras]] (14 major singles titles), and [[Pancho Gonzales|Ricardo Alonso Gonz\u00e1lez]] (14 major singles titles) dominating their sport in the past. More recently, the Williams sisters, [[Venus Williams]] (7 major singles titles) and [[Serena Williams]] (23 major singles titles), have been a dominant force in the women's game, and the [[Bryan brothers|twin brothers]] [[Bob Bryan|Bob]] and [[Mike Bryan]] have claimed almost all significant career records for men's doubles teams.\n\n===Track and field===\n{{Main|United States records in track and field|USA Track & Field}}\n[[File:BillyMills Crossing Finish Line 1964Olympics.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Billy Mills]] breaks the tape in the 10,000 m in the 1964 Olympics.

(Many decades later, he transitioned to a woman and changed her a first name of Caitlyn.)  High school track in the United States became a unique foundation for creating the United States middle-distance running talent pool, and from 1972 to 1981 an average of 13 high school boys in the United States would run under 4:10 in the mile per year.<ref name=\"RW\"/> During this time, several national [[United States high school national records in track and field|high school records in the United States]] were set and remained largely unbroken until the 2000s.

[[Carl Lewis]] is credited with \"normalizing\" the practice of having a lengthy track career as opposed to retiring once reaching the age when it is less realistic of gaining a personal best result. The United States is home to school-sponsored track and field, a tradition in which most schools from middle school through college feature a track and field team.

Interest in pro wrestling peaked during the [[Monday Night Wars]] of the 1980s and 1990s. This was due to the competition between the [[World Wrestling Federation]] (WWF) and [[World Championship Wrestling|WCW]], which were the two biggest professional wrestling organizations in the country during the last two decades of the 20th century, both backed by wealthy moguls with national media access, [[Vince McMahon]] and [[Ted Turner]] respectively. It is also stated that, between the two companies, an estimated 16 million viewers tuned in every week. Following the conclusion of the Wars and WCW's subsumption into WWF to become the modern [[WWE]], professional wrestling's audience has diminished; however, it still pulls in some of cable television's highest weekly ratings. WWE remains the dominant professional wrestling company in the U.S.; it does not hold a monopoly, as numerous smaller federations have existed, three current examples including [[Impact Wrestling]] (formerly known as TNA), [[Ring of Honor]] (ROH), and [[All Elite Wrestling]] (AEW).\n\n[[Judo in the United States]] is not very popular and is eclipsed by more popular martial arts like [[Karate in the United States|karate]] and [[taekwondo]].\n\n===Swimming and water sports===\n[[File:KellySlater byRobKeaton.jpg|thumb|right|[[Kelly Slater]] surfing in the [[Boost Mobile]] Pro at [[Trestles]] ]]\n[[Swimming in the United States|Swimming]] is a major competitive sport at high school and college level, but receives little mainstream media attention outside of the Olympics.\n\n[[Surfing in the United States]] and [[watersports]] are popular in the U.S. in coastal areas.

The [[Arena Football League]] was active from 1987 to 2008 and folded in 2009, but several teams from the AFL and its former minor league, [[AF2|af2]], relaunched the league in 2010. The AFL folded again in 2019. Most extant indoor leagues date to the mid-2000s and are regional in nature.\n\nDedicated [[Women's American football|women's football]] is seldom seen. A few amateur and semi-professional leagues exist, of varying degrees of stability and competition. Football is unique among scholastic sports in the U.S. in that no women's division exists for the sport; [[List of female American football players|women who wish to play football]] in high school or college must compete directly with men.\n\n===Baseball===\n{{Main|Baseball in the United States|Major League Baseball}}\n{{more citations needed section|date=January 2017}}\n[[File:Mickey Mantle 1953.jpg|175px|thumb|right|[[Mickey Mantle]], [[New York Yankees]] centerfielder, in 1953.]]\n\nBaseball and a variant, [[softball]], are popular participatory sports in the U.S. The highest level of baseball in the U.S. is [[Major League Baseball]].

Particularly with [[Chicago]] sports fans who avidly follow the [[Chicago Cubs]] and the [[Chicago White Sox]] despite the comparative lack of success for the teams, with Chicago Cub fans being known throughout the country as one of the best baseball fans in the country, most notably for their passionate loyalty to the team despite their not having won a championship from 1908 to 2016 (108 years) which stands as the longest championship drought in US sports history. The sport has also taken hold of fans on the West Coast, most notably the rivalry between the San Francisco Giants and The Los Angeles Dodgers. Historically, the leagues were much more competitive, and cities such as Boston, Philadelphia and [[St. Louis]] had rival teams in both leagues up until the 1950s.\n\n[[File:Jackie Robinson a211368-v8.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Jackie Robinson]] became the first African American to play in Major League Baseball (MLB) in the modern era.]]\nNotable American baseball players in history include [[Babe Ruth]] (714 career home runs), [[Ty Cobb]] (career leader in batting average and batting titles), [[Cy Young]], [[Honus Wagner]], [[Ted Williams]] (.344 career batting average), [[Lou Gehrig]], [[Joe DiMaggio]], [[Mickey Mantle]] (16-time all star), [[Stan Musial]], [[Willie Mays]], [[Yogi Berra]] (18-time All-Star), [[Hank Aaron]] (career home run leader from 1974 to 2007), [[Mike Schmidt]] (548 career home runs, 10 career Gold Gloves), [[Nolan Ryan]] (career strikeouts leader), [[Roger Clemens]] (7 Cy Young awards), [[Derek Jeter]] and [[Jackie Robinson]], who was instrumental in dissolving the [[baseball color line|color line]] and allowing African-Americans into the major leagues.\n\n[[File:Babe Ruth Red Sox 1918.jpg|thumb|left|[[Babe Ruth]] in 1918. He achieved his greatest fame as a home run batter for the [[New York Yankees]]. ]]\n\nAn extensive [[minor league baseball]] system covers most mid-sized cities in the United States. Minor league baseball teams are organized in a six-tier hierarchy, in which the highest teams ([[Triple-A (baseball)|AAA]]) are in major cities that do not have a major league team but often have a major team in another sport, and each level occupies progressively smaller cities. The lowest levels of professional baseball serve primarily as development systems for the sport's most inexperienced prospects, with the absolute bottom, the rookie leagues, occupying the major league squads' [[spring training]] complexes. \n\nSome limited independent professional baseball exists, the most prominent being the [[Atlantic League of Professional Baseball|Atlantic League]], which occupies mostly suburban locales that are not eligible for high level minor league teams of their own because they are too close to other major or minor league teams.\n\nOutside the minor leagues are [[collegiate summer baseball]] leagues, which occupy towns even smaller than those at the lower end of minor league baseball and typically cannot support professional sports. Summer baseball is an amateur exercise and uses players that choose not to play for payment in order to remain eligible to play [[college baseball]] for their respective universities in the spring. At the absolute lowest end of the organized baseball system is senior amateur baseball (also known as [[Town Team Baseball]]), which typically plays its games only on weekends and uses rosters composed of local residents.\n\n===Basketball===\n{{Main|National Basketball Association|Women's National Basketball Association|College basketball|Basketball in the United States}}\n\nOf those Americans citing their favorite sport, basketball is ranked second (counting amateur levels) behind football.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} However, in regards to money the NBA is ranked third in popularity.<ref name=HARRISPOLL>{{cite web|url=http://www.harrisinteractive.com/harris_poll/index.asp?PollYear=2007 |title=The Harris Poll |website=Harrisinteractive.com |date= |accessdate=September 25, 2016}}</ref> More Americans play basketball than any other team sport, according to the National Sporting Goods Association, with over 26 million Americans playing basketball.\nBasketball was invented in 1891 by Canadian physical education teacher [[James Naismith]] in Springfield, Massachusetts.\n\n[[File:Phil Jackson Lipofsky.JPG|thumb|right|upright=.8182|[[Chicago Bulls]] [[Michael Jordan]] and [[Phil Jackson]] 1997]]\nThe [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA) is the world's premier men's professional basketball league and one of the major professional sports leagues of North America.

After the regular season, eight teams from each conference compete in the playoffs for the [[Larry O'Brien Championship Trophy]].\n\nSince the [[1992 Summer Olympics]], NBA players have represented the United States in international competition and won numerous important tournaments. The [[1992 United States men's Olympic basketball team|Dream Team]] was the unofficial nickname of the United States men's basketball team that won the gold medal at the 1992 Olympics.\n\nBasketball at both the college and high school levels is popular throughout the country. Every March, a 68-team, six-round, single-elimination tournament (commonly called [[NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament|March Madness]]) determines the national champions of NCAA Division I men's college basketball.\n\nMost U.S. states also crown state champions among their high schools.

[[Madison Square Garden]], the home arena of the [[New York Knicks]], is often referred to as the \"Mecca of basketball.\"\n\nMinor league basketball, both official and unofficial, has an extensive presence, given the sport's relative lack of expense to operate a professional team. The NBA has an official minor league, known since 2017 as the [[NBA G League]] under a [[naming rights]] agreement with [[Gatorade]]. The most prominent independent league is [[BIG3]], a [[3x3 (basketball)|three-on-three]] league featuring former NBA stars that launched in 2017. Several other pro basketball leagues exist but are notorious for their instability and low budget operations.\n\nThe [[Women's National Basketball Association|WNBA]] is the premier women's basketball league in the United States as well as the most stable and sustained women's professional sports league in the nation. Several of the 12 teams are owned by NBA teams.

In the U.S. the game is most popular in regions of the country with a cold winter climate, namely the northeast and the upper Midwest. However, since the 1990s, hockey has become increasingly popular in the [[Sun Belt]] due in large part to the expansion of the [[National Hockey League]] to the southern U.S., coupled with the mass relocation of many residents from northern cities with strong hockey support to these Sun Belt locations.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\nThe [[National Hockey League|NHL]] is the major professional hockey league in North America, with 24 U.S.-based teams and 7 Canadian-based teams competing for the [[Stanley Cup]].

The 34-game schedule runs from mid-March to late October, with the playoffs and championship in November. [[Soccer-specific stadiums]] continue to be built for MLS teams around the country, both because football stadiums are considered to have excessive capacity, and because teams profit from operating their stadiums. With an average attendance of over 21,000 per game, MLS has the third-highest average attendance of any sports league in the U.S. after the [[National Football League]] (NFL) and [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB),<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/> and is the ninth-highest attended professional soccer league worldwide.<ref name=\"mlssoccer.com\"/> Other professional men's soccer leagues in the U.S. include the current second division, the [[USL Championship]] (USLC) and the third-level [[USL League One]], which launched in 2019 under the auspices of the USLC's operator, the [[United Soccer League]]. Another competition, the second [[North American Soccer League]], had been the second-level league until being demoted in 2018 due to instability, and soon effectively folded. The USL organization now has a formal relationship with MLS, and a number of its teams (both in the Championship and League One) are either owned by or affiliated with MLS sides.\n\n[[File:Mia Hamm corner (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|[[Mia Hamm]] takes a corner kick]]\nYounger generations of Americans have strong fan appreciation for the sport, due to factors such as the U.S. hosting of the [[1994 FIFA World Cup]] and the formation of Major League Soccer, as well as increased U.S. television coverage of soccer competitions. Many immigrants living in the United States continue to follow soccer as their favorite team sport. United States will host the [[2026 FIFA World Cup]] sharing with [[Canada]] and [[Mexico]].\n\nWomen's professional soccer in the United States has not seen sustained success.

The NWSL has now survived longer than both of its two professional predecessors combined. Of its current nine teams, six share ownership with professional men's clubs\u2014four are wholly owned by MLS team owners, one is wholly owned by a USLC side, and another is in the process of being purchased by a French [[Ligue 1]] side. A tenth team set to start play in 2021 is also owned by a USLC side. However, at the lower levels of the salary scale, the NWSL is effectively semi-professional.\n\nMany notable international soccer players played in the U.S. in the [[North American Soccer League (1968\u201384)|original North American Soccer League]], usually at the end of their playing careers\u2014including [[Pel\u00e9]], [[Eus\u00e9bio]], [[George Best]], [[Franz Beckenbauer]], and [[Johan Cruyff]]\u2014or in MLS\u2014including [[Roberto Donadoni]], [[Lothar Matth\u00e4us]], [[David Beckham]], [[Thierry Henry]], [[Kak\u00e1]], [[David Villa]], [[Wayne Rooney]], and [[Zlatan Ibrahimovi\u0107]].

The first international baseball tournament with top-level players, the [[World Baseball Classic]], also generated some positive reviews after its inaugural tournament in 2006.\n\nThe major professional sports leagues operate [[draft (sports)|drafts]] once a year, in which each league's teams selected eligible prospects. Eligibility differs from league to league. Baseball and ice hockey operate [[minor league]] systems for players who have finished education but are not ready or good enough for the major leagues. The NBA also has a [[NBA G League|development league]] for players who are not ready to play at the top level.\n\n===College sports===\n{{main|College athletics in the United States}}\n[[File:102007-NotreDameStadium-pregameUSC.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[University of Notre Dame]] and [[University of Southern California]] take the field in the 79th edition of the rivalry.]]\nThe extent to which sports are associated with secondary and tertiary education in the United States is rare among nations. Millions of students participate in athletics programs operated by high schools and colleges. Student-athletes often receive [[athletic scholarship|scholarships]] to colleges in recognition of their athletic potential. Currently, the largest governing body of collegiate sports is the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] (NCAA).\n\n[[File:Harvard Rowing Crew at Henley 2004 -2.JPG|thumb|right|200px|[[Harvard]] men's eight at [[Henley Royal Regatta|Henley]], 2004]]\nEspecially in football and basketball, college sports are followed in numbers equaling those of professional sports.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} [[College football]] games can draw over 100,000 spectators. For upper-tier institutions, sports are a significant source of revenue; for less prominent teams, maintaining a high-level team is a major expense. To ensure some semblance of competitive balance, the NCAA divides its institutions into three divisions (four in football), sorted by the number of athletic scholarships each school is willing to offer.\n\nThe most practiced college sports, measured by NCAA reporting on varsity team participation,<ref>The NCAA defines a participant as someone who \"as of the day of the varsity team's first scheduled contest: (a) is listed as a team member; (b) practices with the varsity team and receives coaching from one or more varsity coaches; or (c)received athletically-related student aid.\"</ref> are: (1) football (64,000), (2) baseball/softball (47,000), (3) track and field (46,000),<ref>The NCAA does not give a number for total track and field, but breaks the figures into outdoor and indoor. The number given is for outdoor track and field. The total is likely to be somewhat higher.</ref> (4) soccer (43,000), (5) basketball (32,000), (6) cross-country running (25,000), and (7) swimming/diving (20,000). The most popular sport among female athletes is soccer, followed closely by track and field.<ref name=\"census.gov\"/>\n\n[[Community college]] athletics are governed separately by the [[National Junior College Athletic Association]] (NJCAA).\n\n===High school sports===\n[[File:Mercer Island High School Cheerleaders.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.136364|High school [[Cheerleading|cheerleaders]].

Some states have separate associations for public and non-public high schools.\n\nThe 2018\u201319 school year was the first in 30 years to see a decrease in high school sports participation. Increases through the previous decades had been largely driven by growth in girls' participation.<ref name=\"NFHS survey\">{{cite web|url=https://www.nfhs.org/media/1020412/2018-19_participation_survey.pdf |title=2018\u201319 High School Athletics Participation Survey |publisher=National Federation of State High School Associations |accessdate=December 26, 2019}}</ref> The high school sports with the highest number of participants for 2018\u201319 are:\n\n;Team sports<ref name=\"NFHS survey\"/>\n# Football{{refn|group=hs|11-man football only.

The AAU has existed since 1888, and has been influential in amateur sports for that same time span.\n\nIn the 1970s, the AAU received growing criticism. Many claimed that its regulatory framework was outdated. Women were banned from participating in certain competitions and some runners were locked out.  There were also problems with sporting goods that did not meet the standards of the AAU. During this time, the [[Amateur Sports Act of 1978]] organized the [[United States Olympic Committee]] and saw the re-establishment of state-supported independent associations for the Olympic sports, referred to as [[Sports governing body|national governing bodies]]. As a result, the AAU lost its influence and importance in international sports, and focused on the support and promotion of predominantly youthful athletes, as well as on the organization of national sports events.\n\n===Government regulation===\nNo American government agency is charged with overseeing sports. However, the [[President's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports]] advises the President through the Secretary of Health and Human Services about physical activity, fitness, and sports, and recommends programs to promote regular physical activity for the health of all Americans. The [[Congress of the United States|U.S. Congress]] has chartered the [[United States Olympic Committee]] to govern American participation in the [[Olympic Games|Olympic Movement]] and promote Olympic sports. Congress has also involved itself in several aspects of sports, notably [[Title IX|gender equity]] in college athletics, [[doping (sport)|illegal drugs]] in pro sports, [[sports broadcasting]] and the application of [[antitrust]] law to sports leagues.\n\nIndividual states may also have athletic commissions, which primarily govern individual sports such as [[boxing]], [[kickboxing]] and [[mixed martial arts]]. Notable state athletic commissions are the [[Nevada Athletic Commission]], [[California State Athletic Commission]], [[New York State Athletic Commission]] and [[New Jersey State Athletic Control Board]]. Although these commissions only have jurisdiction over their own states, the [[Full Faith and Credit Clause]] of the [[United States Constitution|U.S. Constitution]] is often interpreted as forcing all other states to recognize any state athletic commission's rulings regarding an athlete's fitness for participating in a sport.\n\n==Sports media in the United States==\n{{See also|List of TV markets and major sports teams in the United States}}\n[[File:Centennial Band Show - Halftime show.webm|thumb|left|Half time show at the game between Frisco High vs. Centennial football game]]\nSports have been a major part of American broadcasting since the early days of radio.<ref>John Catsis, 'Sports Broadcasting'' (1996)</ref> Today, [[television network]]s and [[radio network]]s pay millions (sometimes billions) of dollars for the rights to [[Broadcasting of sports events|broadcast sporting events]].  Contracts between leagues and broadcasters stipulate how often games must be interrupted for [[television commercial|commercials]]. Because of all of the advertisements, broadcasting contracts are very lucrative and account for the biggest chunk of major professional teams' revenues. Broadcasters also covet the television contracts for the major sports leagues (especially in the case of the [[National Football League|NFL]]) in order to amplify their ability to promote their programming to the audience, especially young and middle-aged adult males.<ref>Chris Gratton, and Harry Arne Solberg, ''The economics of sports broadcasting'' (Routledge, 2007)</ref>\n\n[[File:Marching band halftime 2006 CFA Bowl.jpg|250px|right|thumb|A group of high school [[marching band]]s performs at the halftime show of the [[NCAA football bowl games, 2006-07|2006]] [[Chick-fil-A Bowl]].]]\nThe advent of [[cable television|cable]] and [[satellite dish|satellite television]] has greatly expanded sports offerings on American TV.<ref name=\"Catsis, 1996\">Catsis, 'Sports Broadcasting'' (1996)</ref> [[ESPN]], the first all-sports cable network in the U.S., went on the air in 1979.

As in [[Sports in Canada|Canada]] and [[Sport in Australia|Australia]], sports leagues in the United States do not practice [[promotion and relegation]], unlike many sports leagues in Europe.\n\nSports are particularly associated with [[education in the United States]], with most [[High schools in the United States|high schools]] and [[university|universities]] having organized sports, and this is a unique sporting footprint for the U.S. [[College athletics in the United States|College sports]] competitions play an important role in the American sporting culture, and [[college basketball]] and [[college football]] are as popular as professional sports in some parts of the country. The major sanctioning body for college sports is the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] (NCAA).\n\nUnlike most other nations, the United States government does not provide funding for sports nor for the [[United States Olympic Committee]].\n\n==History==\n{{main|History of sports in the United States}}\n[[File:RodeoNatives.jpg|thumb|right|Grand Entry at the [[Pendleton Round-Up]]]]\n\nMost sports in the United States evolved out of European practices. However, [[basketball]], [[volleyball]], [[skateboarding]], and [[snowboarding]] are American inventions, some of which have become popular in other countries and worldwide. [[Lacrosse]] and [[surfing]] arose from Native American and Native Hawaiian activities that predate Western contact.<ref name=liss>Liss, Howard. ''Lacrosse'' (Funk & Wagnalls, 1970) pg 13.</ref>\n\nIn colonial Virginia and Maryland sports occupied a great deal of attention at every social level. In England, hunting was severely restricted to landowners. In America, game was more than plentiful. Everyone\u2014including servants and slaves\u2014could and did hunt, so there was no social distinction to be had. In 1691, Sir [[Francis Nicholson]], the governor of Virginia, organized competitions for the \u201cbetter sort of Virginians onely who are Batchelors,\u201d and he offered prizes \u201cto be shot for, wrastled, played at backswords, & Run for by Horse and foott.\u201d<ref>Quoted in Nancy L.

However, religious evangelists were troubled by the gambling dimension, and democratic elements complained that it was too aristocratic, since only the rich could own very expensive competitive horses.\n\n==Olympics==\n{{main|United States at the Olympics}}\n[[File:HerbBrooksArena.jpg|alt=|thumb|The Herb Brooks Arena in the Olympic Center at Lake Placid, New York hosted the [[Miracle on Ice]] match]]\n\nThe [[United States Olympic Committee]] (USOC) is the [[National Olympic Committee]] for the United States. U.S. athletes have won a total of 2,522 medals  (1,022 of them being gold) at the [[Summer Olympic Games]] and another 305 at the [[Winter Olympic Games]]. Most medals have been won in the [[sport of athletics]] ([[track and field]]) (801, 32%) and [[Swimming (sport)|swimming]] (553, 22%). American swimmer [[Michael Phelps]] is the most decorated Olympic athlete of all time, with 28 Olympic medals, 23 of them gold.\n\n[[File:Michael Phelps wins 8th gold medal.jpg|thumb|upright=.91|left|[[Michael Phelps]] celebrates after winning his 8th gold medal in the [[2008 Summer Olympics]]]]\n\nThe United States has sent athletes to every celebration of the modern [[Olympic Games]] except the [[1980 Summer Olympics]] hosted by the Soviet Union in Moscow, which it [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott|boycotted]] because of the [[Soviet\u2013Afghan War|Soviet invasion of Afghanistan]].\n\nThe United States has won gold at every games in which it has competed, [[All-time Olympic Games medal table|more gold and overall medals]] than any other country in the Summer Games and also has the second-most gold and overall medals in the Winter Games, trailing [[Norway at the Olympics|Norway]]. From the mid-20th century to the late 1980s, the United States mainly competed with the [[Soviet Union at the Olympics|Soviet Union]] at the Summer Games and with the Soviet Union, Norway, and [[East Germany at the Olympics|East Germany]] at the Winter Games. However, after the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]], it now primarily contends with [[China at the Olympics|China]] and [[Great Britain at the Olympics|Great Britain]] at the Summer Games for both the overall medal count and the gold medal count and with Norway and [[Canada at the Olympics|Canada]] at the Winter Games for the overall medal count.\n\nThe United States hosted both Summer and Winter Games in 1932, and has hosted more Games than any other country \u2013 eight times, four times each for the Summer and Winter Games:[[File:Francis Field 1904.jpg|thumb|[[Francis Olympic Field]] of [[Washington University in St. Louis]], site of the [[1904 Summer Olympics|1904 Olympics Games]]]]\n\n*the [[1904 Summer Olympics]] in St. Louis, [[1932 Summer Olympics]] and [[1984 Summer Olympics]] in Los Angeles; and the [[1996 Summer Olympics]] in Atlanta;\n* the [[1932 Winter Olympics]] and [[1980 Winter Olympics]] in Lake Placid, New York; the [[1960 Winter Olympics]] in Squaw Valley, California; and the [[2002 Winter Olympics]] in Salt Lake City, Utah.\n\nLos Angeles will host the Summer Olympics for a third time in [[2028 Summer Olympics|2028]], marking the ninth time the U.S. hosts the Olympic Games.\n\nThe United States has won the most gold and overall medals in the Summer Olympic Games, even if the medal totals of the Soviet Union/CIS and Russia are combined, and has topped the medal table 17 times. The country has won the second most gold and overall medals in the Winter Olympic Games, behind Norway, but has topped the medal table only 1 time, in 1932. If all of Germany's and Russia's incarnations are combined, the United States slips to fourth in the all-time Winter Olympic Games table.\n\n===Amateurism and professionalism===\nThe exclusion of professionals caused several controversies throughout the history of the modern Olympics. The [[1912 Summer Olympics|1912 Olympic]] [[pentathlon]] and [[decathlon]] champion [[Jim Thorpe]] was stripped of his medals when it was discovered that he had played semi-professional baseball before the Olympics. His medals were posthumously restored by the [[International Olympic Committee|IOC]] in 1983 on compassionate grounds.<ref>{{cite web |title=Jim Thorpe Biography |publisher=Biography.com |url=http://www.biography.com/search/article.do?id=9507017 |accessdate=9 February 2009}}</ref>\n\nThe advent of the state-sponsored \"full-time amateur athlete\" of the [[Eastern Bloc]] countries eroded the ideology of the pure [[amateur sports#Olympics|amateur]], as it put the self-financed amateurs of the Western countries at a disadvantage. The [[Soviet Union at the Olympics|Soviet Union]] entered teams of athletes who were all nominally students, soldiers, or working in a profession, but all of whom were in reality paid by the state to train on a full-time basis.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.bu.edu/guidedhistory/russia-and-its-empires/tyler-benson/|title=The Role of Sports in The Soviet Union - Guided History|website=blogs.bu.edu}}</ref><ref name=\"cia.gov\">{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP80-00810A005600130009-0.pdf |title=Info |website=www.cia.gov }}</ref><ref name=\"cia.gov\"/> The situation greatly disadvantaged American athletes, and was a major factor in the decline of American medal hauls in the 1970s and 1980s. As a result, the Olympics shifted away from [[Amateur sports|amateurism]], as envisioned by [[Pierre de Coubertin]], to allowing participation of [[professional athlete]]s, but only in the 1990s, after the [[collapse of the Soviet Union]] and its influence within the [[International Olympic Committee]].\n\n==Individual sports==\n\n===Motorsports===\n{{main|Motorsport in the United States}}\n[[File:RichardPetty1985Pocono.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Richard Petty]]]]\n\nMotor sports are widely popular in the United States but Americans generally show little interest in the major international competitions, such as the [[Formula One]] Grand Prix series and [[Grand Prix motorcycle racing|MotoGP]], preferring home-grown racing series.  However, some Americans have achieved great success in these international series, such as [[Mario Andretti]] and [[Kenny Roberts]].\n\nAmericans, like the rest of the world, initially began using public streets to host automobile races, but these venues were often unsafe to the public as they offered relatively little crowd control. Promoters and drivers in the United States discovered that [[horse racing]] tracks could provide better conditions for drivers and spectators than public streets. This, in turn, was succeeded by [[board track racing]] (which was short-lived as many of the tracks were highly flammable and difficult to maintain) followed by [[oval track racing]], which remains the dominant form of racing in the United States but is not used in the rest of the world; [[road racing]] has generally waned. However, an extensive, albeit illegal [[street racing]] culture still persists.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://auto-racing.speedtv.com/article/despain-my-take-on-open-wheel-racing-in-america/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=July 22, 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517073126/http://auto-racing.speedtv.com/article/despain-my-take-on-open-wheel-racing-in-america/ |archivedate=May 17, 2008 |df=mdy }}</ref>\n\n====IndyCar Series====\n{{Main|IndyCar Series}}\n[[File:Danica Patrick 2008 Indy 500 Pole Day.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Danica Patrick]] is the most successful woman in the history of [[American Championship Car Racing|American open-wheel racing]].]]\n\nHistorically, [[American Championship Car Racing|open wheel racing]] was the most popular form of U.S. motorsport nationwide. However, an infamously acrimonious split (often referred to by many as \"The Split\") in 1994 between the primary series, CART (later known as [[Champ Car]]), and the owner of the [[Indianapolis Motor Speedway]] (the site of the Indy 500), [[Tony George]], led to the formation of the Indy Racing League, now known as [[INDYCAR]], which launched the rival IndyCar Series in 1996. From that point on, the popularity of open wheel racing in the U.S. declined dramatically.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/rpm/columns/story?seriesId=1&columnist=oreovicz_john&id=3180918 |title=American open-wheel racing held hostage: Year 13 |first=John |last=Oreovicz |work=[[ESPN.com]] |date=January 6, 2008 |accessdate=January 6, 2008}}</ref> The feud was settled in 2008 with an agreement to merge the two series under the IndyCar banner, but enormous damage had already been done to the sport.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/rpm/news/story?seriesId=1&id=3259364 |title=After 12 years of conflict, IRL and Champ Car merge |agency=Associated Press |publisher=ESPN.com |date=February 22, 2008 |accessdate=February 22, 2008}}</ref> Post-merger, IndyCar continues to run with slight viewership gains per year.

NASCAR's audience peaked in the early 2000s, and has declined quite a bit ever since the implementation of the [[NASCAR playoffs|Chase for the Cup]] in 2004, though it continues to have around 2\u20134 million viewers per race. Among NASCAR's popular former drivers are [[Jeff Gordon]], [[Dale Earnhardt]], [[Matt Kenseth]], [[Tony Stewart]], [[Dale Earnhardt Jr.]], and [[Richard Petty]]. Among NASCAR's popular active drivers are [[Jimmie Johnson]], [[Kurt Busch]], [[Kyle Busch]], [[Chase Elliott]], [[Ryan Blaney]], and [[Kyle Larson]]. NASCAR's most popular race is the [[Daytona 500]], the opening race of the season, held each year at [[Daytona Beach, Florida]] in February.\n\n====Other motorsports====\nAmong the better known [[sports car racing|sports car races]] in the United States are the [[24 Hours of Daytona]], [[12 Hours of Sebring]], and [[Petit Le Mans]], which have featured in the [[World Sportscar Championship]], [[IMSA GT Championship]], [[Intercontinental Le Mans Cup]], [[FIA World Endurance Championship]], [[American Le Mans Series]], [[Rolex Sports Car Series]] and currently the [[United SportsCar Championship]].\n\nAnother one of the most popular forms of motorsports in the United States is the indigenous sport of [[drag racing]]. The largest drag racing organization is the [[National Hot Rod Association]].\n\nSeveral other motorsports enjoy varying degrees of popularity in the United States: [[short track motor racing]], [[motocross]], [[monster truck]] competitions (including the popular [[Monster Jam]] circuit), [[demolition derby]], [[figure 8 racing]], [[mud bogging]] and [[tractor pulling]].\n\n===Golf===\n{{main|Golf in the United States}}\n[[File:JackNicklaus.cropped.jpg|thumb|left|[[Jack Nicklaus]] is widely regarded as the greatest golfer of all time, winning a total of 18 career major championships.]]\n[[File:Louise Suggs 1958.JPG|thumb|right|150px|[[Louise Suggs]] one of the founders of the LPGA Tour and thus modern ladies' golf.]]\n\nGolf is played in the United States by about 25 million people.

The USGA conducts four national championships open to professionals: the [[U.S. Open (golf)|U.S. Open]], [[U.S. Women's Open]], [[U.S. Senior Open]], and the [[U.S. Senior Women's Open]], with the last of these holding its first edition in 2018. The [[PGA of America]] organizes the [[PGA Championship]], [[Senior PGA Championship]] and [[Women's PGA Championship]]. Three legs of the [[Grand Slam (golf)|Grand Slam of Golf]] are based in the United States: the PGA Championship, U.S. Open and [[Masters Tournament|The Masters]]. ([[The Open Championship]], known in the U.S. as the British Open, is played in the United Kingdom.)\n\nThe [[PGA Tour]] is the main professional golf tour in the United States, and the [[LPGA|LPGA Tour]] is the main women's professional tour. Also of note is [[PGA Tour Champions]], where players 50 and older compete. Golf is aired on several television networks, such as [[Golf Channel]], [[Golf Channel on NBC|NBC]], [[Golf on ESPN|ESPN]], [[PGA Tour on CBS|CBS]] and [[Fox USGA|Fox]].\n\nNotable American male golfers include [[Walter Hagen]] (11 majors), [[Ben Hogan]], [[Jack Nicklaus]] (record 18 major wins), [[Arnold Palmer]], and [[Tiger Woods]] (15 major wins).

The pinnacle of the sport in the country is the [[US Open (Tennis)|US Open]] played in late August at the [[USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center]] in New York. The [[Indian Wells Masters]], [[Miami Open (tennis)|Miami Open]] and [[Cincinnati Masters]] are part of the [[ATP Tour Masters 1000]] and the former [[WTA Tier I]] (currently Premier Mandatory and Premier 5).\n\nThe United States has had considerable success in tennis for many years, with players such as [[Don Budge]], [[Billie Jean King]] (12 major singles titles), [[Chris Evert]] (18 major singles titles), [[Jimmy Connors]] (8 major singles titles), [[John McEnroe]] (7 major singles titles), [[Andre Agassi]] (8 major singles titles) and [[Pete Sampras]] (14 major singles titles), and [[Pancho Gonzales|Ricardo Alonso Gonz\u00e1lez]] (14 major singles titles) dominating their sport in the past. More recently, the Williams sisters, [[Venus Williams]] (7 major singles titles) and [[Serena Williams]] (23 major singles titles), have been a dominant force in the women's game, and the [[Bryan brothers|twin brothers]] [[Bob Bryan|Bob]] and [[Mike Bryan]] have claimed almost all significant career records for men's doubles teams.\n\n===Track and field===\n{{Main|United States records in track and field|USA Track & Field}}\n[[File:BillyMills Crossing Finish Line 1964Olympics.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Billy Mills]] breaks the tape in the 10,000 m in the 1964 Olympics.

This was due to the competition between the [[World Wrestling Federation]] (WWF) and [[World Championship Wrestling|WCW]], which were the two biggest professional wrestling organizations in the country during the last two decades of the 20th century, both backed by wealthy moguls with national media access, [[Vince McMahon]] and [[Ted Turner]] respectively.

The popularity of college and high school football in areas such as the [[Southern United States]] ([[Southeastern Conference]]) and the [[Great Plains]] ([[Big 12 Conference]] and [[Big Ten Conference]]) stems largely from the fact that these areas historically generally did not possess markets large enough for a professional team.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=JyqbTl9fsc4C&pg=PA214&lpg=PA214&dq=great+plains+states+football+population#v=onepage&q=great%20plains%20states%20football%20population&f=false|title=The Great Plains States of America: People, Politics, and Power in the Nine ... \u2013 Neal R.

The sport has also taken hold of fans on the West Coast, most notably the rivalry between the San Francisco Giants and The Los Angeles Dodgers.

Minor league baseball teams are organized in a six-tier hierarchy, in which the highest teams ([[Triple-A (baseball)|AAA]]) are in major cities that do not have a major league team but often have a major team in another sport, and each level occupies progressively smaller cities. The lowest levels of professional baseball serve primarily as development systems for the sport's most inexperienced prospects, with the absolute bottom, the rookie leagues, occupying the major league squads' [[spring training]] complexes. \n\nSome limited independent professional baseball exists, the most prominent being the [[Atlantic League of Professional Baseball|Atlantic League]], which occupies mostly suburban locales that are not eligible for high level minor league teams of their own because they are too close to other major or minor league teams.\n\nOutside the minor leagues are [[collegiate summer baseball]] leagues, which occupy towns even smaller than those at the lower end of minor league baseball and typically cannot support professional sports. Summer baseball is an amateur exercise and uses players that choose not to play for payment in order to remain eligible to play [[college baseball]] for their respective universities in the spring. At the absolute lowest end of the organized baseball system is senior amateur baseball (also known as [[Town Team Baseball]]), which typically plays its games only on weekends and uses rosters composed of local residents.\n\n===Basketball===\n{{Main|National Basketball Association|Women's National Basketball Association|College basketball|Basketball in the United States}}\n\nOf those Americans citing their favorite sport, basketball is ranked second (counting amateur levels) behind football.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} However, in regards to money the NBA is ranked third in popularity.<ref name=HARRISPOLL>{{cite web|url=http://www.harrisinteractive.com/harris_poll/index.asp?PollYear=2007 |title=The Harris Poll |website=Harrisinteractive.com |date= |accessdate=September 25, 2016}}</ref> More Americans play basketball than any other team sport, according to the National Sporting Goods Association, with over 26 million Americans playing basketball.\nBasketball was invented in 1891 by Canadian physical education teacher [[James Naismith]] in Springfield, Massachusetts.\n\n[[File:Phil Jackson Lipofsky.JPG|thumb|right|upright=.8182|[[Chicago Bulls]] [[Michael Jordan]] and [[Phil Jackson]] 1997]]\nThe [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA) is the world's premier men's professional basketball league and one of the major professional sports leagues of North America.

Another competition, the second [[North American Soccer League]], had been the second-level league until being demoted in 2018 due to instability, and soon effectively folded. The USL organization now has a formal relationship with MLS, and a number of its teams (both in the Championship and League One) are either owned by or affiliated with MLS sides.\n\n[[File:Mia Hamm corner (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|[[Mia Hamm]] takes a corner kick]]\nYounger generations of Americans have strong fan appreciation for the sport, due to factors such as the U.S. hosting of the [[1994 FIFA World Cup]] and the formation of Major League Soccer, as well as increased U.S. television coverage of soccer competitions. Many immigrants living in the United States continue to follow soccer as their favorite team sport. United States will host the [[2026 FIFA World Cup]] sharing with [[Canada]] and [[Mexico]].\n\nWomen's professional soccer in the United States has not seen sustained success. Following the demise of two professional leagues in the early 21st century, the [[Women's United Soccer Association]] (1999\u20132001) and [[Women's Professional Soccer]] (2009\u20132011), U.S. Soccer established a new [[National Women's Soccer League]] in 2013. The NWSL has now survived longer than both of its two professional predecessors combined. Of its current nine teams, six share ownership with professional men's clubs\u2014four are wholly owned by MLS team owners, one is wholly owned by a USLC side, and another is in the process of being purchased by a French [[Ligue 1]] side. A tenth team set to start play in 2021 is also owned by a USLC side. However, at the lower levels of the salary scale, the NWSL is effectively semi-professional.\n\nMany notable international soccer players played in the U.S. in the [[North American Soccer League (1968\u201384)|original North American Soccer League]], usually at the end of their playing careers\u2014including [[Pel\u00e9]], [[Eus\u00e9bio]], [[George Best]], [[Franz Beckenbauer]], and [[Johan Cruyff]]\u2014or in MLS\u2014including [[Roberto Donadoni]], [[Lothar Matth\u00e4us]], [[David Beckham]], [[Thierry Henry]], [[Kak\u00e1]], [[David Villa]], [[Wayne Rooney]], and [[Zlatan Ibrahimovi\u0107]].

It is played widely at numerous NCAA colleges, where it is used as a sport to offset [[Title IX]] regulations assuring equal opportunities for men and women in sports (it thus offsets male-dominated sports such as college football).\n\n[[Handball]], a common sport in European countries, is seldom seen in the United States. The sport is mostly played in the country on the amateur level. Handball is played in the [[Summer Olympics]], but is not sanctioned by the NCAA; all college and university teams play as club teams.

The NCAA sanctions water polo as a varsity sport for both men and women, and  is  popular in the U.S. along the west coast, and parts of the east coast. However, no team outside of California has ever reached the finals of the NCAA Division I men's water polo championship.\n\n[[Esports]] in the united states has a viewership, which now mostly occurs on [[YouTube]] and [[Twitch (service)|Twitch]], which is likely to grow. Once an under-the-radar activity, esports is now a multimillion-dollar business in the U.S., with implications for [[game developers]], players, leagues, teams, live venues, streaming platforms, TV networks, audiences and marketers. [[College esports in the United States]] began around 2009. Various schools began forming esports clubs to play any number of video games in collegiate tournaments. In 2019 there were at least over 130 college varsity programs. The [[Overwatch League]] is a professional esports league for the video game [[Overwatch (video game)|Overwatch]], produced by its developer [[Blizzard Entertainment]].\n\n==Organization of American sports==\n===Professional sports===\n{{See also|Major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada}}\n\n[[File:ThunderII.jpg|thumbnail|right|[[Thunder (mascot)|Thunder II]], live animal [[mascot]] for the [[Denver Broncos]].]]\n\nFor the most part, unlike sports in Europe and other parts of the world, there is no system of [[promotion and relegation]] in American professional sports. Major sports leagues operate as associations of [[Professional sports league organization|franchises]]. The same 30\u201332 teams play in the league each year unless they move to another city or the league chooses to expand with new franchises.\n\nAll American sports leagues use the same type of schedule. After the regular season, the 10\u201316 teams with the best records enter a [[playoff]] tournament leading to a championship series or game. American sports, except for soccer, have no equivalent to the cup competitions that run concurrently with leagues in European sports. Even in the case of soccer, the cup competition, the [[Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup]], draws considerably less attention than the regular season. Also, the only top-level U.S. professional teams that play teams from other organizations in meaningful games are those in [[Major League Soccer|MLS]]. Since the 2012 season, all U.S.-based MLS teams have automatically qualified for the U.S. Open Cup, in which they compete against teams from lower-level U.S. leagues. In addition, three or four U.S.-based MLS teams (depending on the results of the U.S. Open Cup) qualify to play clubs from countries outside the U.S. and Canada in the [[CONCACAF Champions League]].{{NoteTag|The U.S. is guaranteed four places in the CONCACAF Champions League. Three places are automatically reserved for MLS teams: the [[MLS Cup]] winner (league champion), the [[Supporters' Shield]] winner (best regular-season record), and the team with the best regular-season record in the opposite conference from the Shield winner. The fourth place goes to the U.S. Open Cup winner, which is not necessarily an MLS team. Note that Canada-based MLS teams are not eligible to fill Champions League places reserved for MLS; those teams compete in the [[Canadian Championship]], the winner of which receives that country's sole Champions League place. If a team qualifies for the Champions League by more than one method, or if a Canada-based team fills an automatic qualifying spot, the Champions League place passes to the U.S.-based MLS team with the best regular-season record among those not already qualified.}} NBA teams have played [[Euroleague|European]] teams in preseason exhibitions on a semi-regular basis, and recent [[Major League Soccer All-Star Game|MLS All-Star Game]]s have pitted top players from the league against major European soccer teams, such as members of the [[Premier League]].\n\nInternational competition is not as important in American sports as it is in the sporting culture of most other countries, although [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] ice hockey and basketball tournaments do generate attention. The first international baseball tournament with top-level players, the [[World Baseball Classic]], also generated some positive reviews after its inaugural tournament in 2006.\n\nThe major professional sports leagues operate [[draft (sports)|drafts]] once a year, in which each league's teams selected eligible prospects. Eligibility differs from league to league. Baseball and ice hockey operate [[minor league]] systems for players who have finished education but are not ready or good enough for the major leagues. The NBA also has a [[NBA G League|development league]] for players who are not ready to play at the top level.\n\n===College sports===\n{{main|College athletics in the United States}}\n[[File:102007-NotreDameStadium-pregameUSC.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[University of Notre Dame]] and [[University of Southern California]] take the field in the 79th edition of the rivalry.]]\nThe extent to which sports are associated with secondary and tertiary education in the United States is rare among nations. Millions of students participate in athletics programs operated by high schools and colleges. Student-athletes often receive [[athletic scholarship|scholarships]] to colleges in recognition of their athletic potential. Currently, the largest governing body of collegiate sports is the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] (NCAA).\n\n[[File:Harvard Rowing Crew at Henley 2004 -2.JPG|thumb|right|200px|[[Harvard]] men's eight at [[Henley Royal Regatta|Henley]], 2004]]\nEspecially in football and basketball, college sports are followed in numbers equaling those of professional sports.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} [[College football]] games can draw over 100,000 spectators. For upper-tier institutions, sports are a significant source of revenue; for less prominent teams, maintaining a high-level team is a major expense. To ensure some semblance of competitive balance, the NCAA divides its institutions into three divisions (four in football), sorted by the number of athletic scholarships each school is willing to offer.\n\nThe most practiced college sports, measured by NCAA reporting on varsity team participation,<ref>The NCAA defines a participant as someone who \"as of the day of the varsity team's first scheduled contest: (a) is listed as a team member; (b) practices with the varsity team and receives coaching from one or more varsity coaches; or (c)received athletically-related student aid.\"</ref> are: (1) football (64,000), (2) baseball/softball (47,000), (3) track and field (46,000),<ref>The NCAA does not give a number for total track and field, but breaks the figures into outdoor and indoor.

Some states have separate associations for public and non-public high schools.\n\nThe 2018\u201319 school year was the first in 30 years to see a decrease in high school sports participation.

The AAU has existed since 1888, and has been influential in amateur sports for that same time span.\n\nIn the 1970s, the AAU received growing criticism. Many claimed that its regulatory framework was outdated. Women were banned from participating in certain competitions and some runners were locked out.  There were also problems with sporting goods that did not meet the standards of the AAU. During this time, the [[Amateur Sports Act of 1978]] organized the [[United States Olympic Committee]] and saw the re-establishment of state-supported independent associations for the Olympic sports, referred to as [[Sports governing body|national governing bodies]]. As a result, the AAU lost its influence and importance in international sports, and focused on the support and promotion of predominantly youthful athletes, as well as on the organization of national sports events.\n\n===Government regulation===\nNo American government agency is charged with overseeing sports. However, the [[President's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports]] advises the President through the Secretary of Health and Human Services about physical activity, fitness, and sports, and recommends programs to promote regular physical activity for the health of all Americans. The [[Congress of the United States|U.S. Congress]] has chartered the [[United States Olympic Committee]] to govern American participation in the [[Olympic Games|Olympic Movement]] and promote Olympic sports. Congress has also involved itself in several aspects of sports, notably [[Title IX|gender equity]] in college athletics, [[doping (sport)|illegal drugs]] in pro sports, [[sports broadcasting]] and the application of [[antitrust]] law to sports leagues.\n\nIndividual states may also have athletic commissions, which primarily govern individual sports such as [[boxing]], [[kickboxing]] and [[mixed martial arts]]. Notable state athletic commissions are the [[Nevada Athletic Commission]], [[California State Athletic Commission]], [[New York State Athletic Commission]] and [[New Jersey State Athletic Control Board]]. Although these commissions only have jurisdiction over their own states, the [[Full Faith and Credit Clause]] of the [[United States Constitution|U.S. Constitution]] is often interpreted as forcing all other states to recognize any state athletic commission's rulings regarding an athlete's fitness for participating in a sport.\n\n==Sports media in the United States==\n{{See also|List of TV markets and major sports teams in the United States}}\n[[File:Centennial Band Show - Halftime show.webm|thumb|left|Half time show at the game between Frisco High vs. Centennial football game]]\nSports have been a major part of American broadcasting since the early days of radio.<ref>John Catsis, 'Sports Broadcasting'' (1996)</ref> Today, [[television network]]s and [[radio network]]s pay millions (sometimes billions) of dollars for the rights to [[Broadcasting of sports events|broadcast sporting events]].  Contracts between leagues and broadcasters stipulate how often games must be interrupted for [[television commercial|commercials]]. Because of all of the advertisements, broadcasting contracts are very lucrative and account for the biggest chunk of major professional teams' revenues. Broadcasters also covet the television contracts for the major sports leagues (especially in the case of the [[National Football League|NFL]]) in order to amplify their ability to promote their programming to the audience, especially young and middle-aged adult males.<ref>Chris Gratton, and Harry Arne Solberg, ''The economics of sports broadcasting'' (Routledge, 2007)</ref>\n\n[[File:Marching band halftime 2006 CFA Bowl.jpg|250px|right|thumb|A group of high school [[marching band]]s performs at the halftime show of the [[NCAA football bowl games, 2006-07|2006]] [[Chick-fil-A Bowl]].]]\nThe advent of [[cable television|cable]] and [[satellite dish|satellite television]] has greatly expanded sports offerings on American TV.<ref name=\"Catsis, 1996\">Catsis, 'Sports Broadcasting'' (1996)</ref> [[ESPN]], the first all-sports cable network in the U.S., went on the air in 1979.
