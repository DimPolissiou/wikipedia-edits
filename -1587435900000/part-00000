Only one Protestant separate school board operates in Ontario (which does not operate any secondary schools); all other separate school boards in Ontario are Catholic.}}\n\nPublic secular secondary schools may operate under a number of designations, including ''[[collegiate institute]]'', {{Lang|fr|\u00e9cole secondaire}}, ''high school'', and ''secondary school''. Public separate secondary schools are typically named ''academy'', ''Catholic high school'', ''Catholic secondary school'', ''college school'' or {{Lang|fr|\u00e9cole secondaire catholique}}.\n{{TOC limit|2}}\n\n==[[Algoma District]]==\n===English public===\n{{col div}}\n*Central Algoma Secondary School, [[Desbarats, Ontario|Desbarats]]\n*Chapleau High School, [[Chapleau, Ontario|Chapleau]]\n*[[Elliot Lake Secondary School]], [[Elliot Lake, Ontario|Elliot Lake]]\n*Hornepayne High School, [[Hornepayne, Ontario|Hornepayne]]\n*[[Korah Collegiate & Vocational School]], [[Sault Ste.

FL Studio features a [[graphical user interface]] based on a pattern-based [[music sequencer]]. The program is available in four different editions for [[Microsoft Windows]] and [[macOS]], including Fruity Edition, Producer Edition, Signature Bundle, and All Plugins Bundle.<ref name=\"what\"/> Image-Line offers lifetime free updates to the program, which means customers receive all future updates of the software for free after one time purchase.<ref name=\"flstudio\"/> Image-Line also develops [[FL Studio Mobile]] for [[iPod Touch]], [[iPhone]], [[iPad]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]] devices.<ref name=\"mobile\"/>\n\nFL Studio can also be used as a [[VST instrument#VST plugins|VST instrument]] in other audio workstation programs and also functions as a [[ReWire]] client.  Image-Line also offers other VST instruments and audio applications. FL Studio has been used by numerous [[hip hop music|hip hop]] and [[electronic dance music|EDM]] producers.\n\n==History of FL Studio==\nThe first version of FruityLoops (1.0.0) was developed by Didier Dambrin and was partially released in December 1997. Its official launch was in early 1998, when it was still a four-channel<ref name=\"techmag\"/> [[MIDI]] [[drum machine]].<ref name=\"Lex Luger (producer)\"/> Dambrin became Chief Software Architect for the program,<ref name=\"ovguide\">{{cite news|title=FL Studio Video|url=http://www.ovguide.com/fl-studio-9202a8c04000641f80000000001e8c37|publisher=OVGuide|accessdate=2011-05-28|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6BVDMAk0f?url=http://www.ovguide.com/fl-studio-9202a8c04000641f80000000001e8c37|archive-date=2012-10-18|url-status=dead\n}}</ref><ref name=\"QUICKSELLING\" /> and it quickly underwent a series of large upgrades that made it into a popular and complex [[digital audio workstation]]. FL Studio has undergone a number of major updates since its inception. On 22 May 2018, a macOS-compatible version of FL Studio was released.\n\n==Software overview==\n\n* '''FL Studio Express''' - This version allows for [[step sequencer]]-only editing and is chiefly suited for 64-step [[loop (music)|loop]] creation.<ref name=\"what\"/> Each pattern can consist of an unlimited number of instruments\u2014either samples, native, or [[Virtual Studio Technology|VST]] instruments. Instruments in the pattern can be routed to the Mixer tool for effects processing, and effects as of version 10.0 include Delay, Delay Bank, EQUOo, Flangus, Love Philter, Vocoder, Parametric EQ & EQ2, Multiband Compressor, Spectroman, Stereo Enhancer, Wave Candy, Wave Shaper, and Soundgoodizer. There is no [[piano roll]], playlist ability, automation, audio recording, or VST/[[ReWire]] client.<ref name=\"editions\">{{cite news|title=Editions|url=http://www.image-line.com/flstudio-feature-comparison/|publisher=[[Image-Line Software]]|website=image-line.com|accessdate=2015-04-26}}</ref>\n* '''Fruity Edition''' \u2013 The Fruity Edition allows users to access the playlist, [[piano roll]], and event automation features, which allow for complex and lengthy arranging and sequencing. There is also VST/ReWire support so that FL Studio can be an instrument in other hosts such as Cubase, Sonic Solutions, [[Logic Studio|Logic]], and other software. As of version 10.0 this edition includes the Simsynth Live [[synthesizer]] instrument, the DrumSynth live percussion synthesizer, the DX10FM synthesizer, and the Wasp/Wasp XT synthesizers. There is no audio recording feature.<ref name=\"editions\"/> In FL Studio 12, this was given (spline-based) automation.\n* '''Producer Edition''' \u2013 The Producer Edition includes all of the features of the Fruity Edition, as well as full recording for internal and external audio and post-production tools. It allows for hand-drawing point and curve based [[spline (mathematics)|splines]] (referred to as \"Automation Clips\"). Plugins include Edison, Slicex (loop slicer and re-arranger), [[Sytrus]], Maximus, Vocodex and Synthmaker. It also allows for waveform viewing of audio clips and the ability to add cue points.<ref name=\"editions\"/>\n* '''Signature Bundle''' \u2013 This edition includes the Producer Edition as well as a series of plugins such as the Fruity Video player, DirectWave Sampler, Harmless, NewTone, Pitcher, Gross Beat and the Hardcore Guitar Effects Suite.<ref name=\"editions\"/>\n* '''All Plugins Bundle''' \u2013 The All Plugins Bundle includes the Signature Bundle along with extra plugins, particularly synthesizers.\n* '''Free Demo''' \u2013 The free demo version includes all of the program's features, all plugins, and allows users to render project audio to [[WAV]], [[MIDI]], [[MP3]], and [[Ogg|OGG]].<ref name=\"what\" /> However, there are several drawbacks to this limitation as projects saved in demo mode will only open fully once FL Studio and plugins have been registered. Also, instrument presets cannot be saved and the audio output of some instruments will cut out momentarily every few minutes until the program and its plugins have been registered.<ref name=\"FL Studio 12.5 BETA 3\" />\n* '''Mobile''' \u2013 On June 21, 2011, Image-Line released [[FL Studio Mobile]] for iOS and in April 2013 for Android. Both support the ability to create multi-track projects on mobile devices including [[iPod Touch]]es, [[iPhone]]s, [[iPad]]s.,<ref name=\"mobile\"/> Android 2.3.3 and higher Smart Phones and Tablets.\n* '''Groove''' \u2013 On September 2, 2013, A new standalone app for Windows 8 was released.

is a [[digital audio workstation]] developed by the Belgian company [[Image-Line]]. FL Studio features a [[graphical user interface]] based on a pattern-based [[music sequencer]]. The program is available in four different editions for [[Microsoft Windows]] and [[macOS]], including Fruity Edition, Producer Edition, Signature Bundle, and All Plugins Bundle.<ref name=\"what\"/> Image-Line offers lifetime free updates to the program, which means customers receive all future updates of the software for free after one time purchase.<ref name=\"flstudio\"/> Image-Line also develops [[FL Studio Mobile]] for [[iPod Touch]], [[iPhone]], [[iPad]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]] devices.<ref name=\"mobile\"/>\n\nFL Studio can also be used as a [[VST instrument#VST plugins|VST instrument]] in other audio workstation programs and also functions as a [[ReWire]] client.  Image-Line also offers other VST instruments and audio applications. FL Studio has been used by numerous [[hip hop music|hip hop]] and [[electronic dance music|EDM]] producers.\n\n==History of FL Studio==\nThe first version of FruityLoops (1.0.0) was developed by Didier Dambrin and was partially released in December 1997. Its official launch was in early 1998, when it was still a four-channel<ref name=\"techmag\"/> [[MIDI]] [[drum machine]].<ref name=\"Lex Luger (producer)\"/> Dambrin became Chief Software Architect for the program,<ref name=\"ovguide\">{{cite news|title=FL Studio Video|url=http://www.ovguide.com/fl-studio-9202a8c04000641f80000000001e8c37|publisher=OVGuide|accessdate=2011-05-28|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6BVDMAk0f?url=http://www.ovguide.com/fl-studio-9202a8c04000641f80000000001e8c37|archive-date=2012-10-18|url-status=dead\n}}</ref><ref name=\"QUICKSELLING\" /> and it quickly underwent a series of large upgrades that made it into a popular and complex [[digital audio workstation]]. FL Studio has undergone a number of major updates since its inception. On 22 May 2018, a macOS-compatible version of FL Studio was released.\n\n==Software overview==\n\n* '''FL Studio Express''' - This version allows for [[step sequencer]]-only editing and is chiefly suited for 64-step [[loop (music)|loop]] creation.<ref name=\"what\"/> Each pattern can consist of an unlimited number of instruments\u2014either samples, native, or [[Virtual Studio Technology|VST]] instruments. Instruments in the pattern can be routed to the Mixer tool for effects processing, and effects as of version 10.0 include Delay, Delay Bank, EQUOo, Flangus, Love Philter, Vocoder, Parametric EQ & EQ2, Multiband Compressor, Spectroman, Stereo Enhancer, Wave Candy, Wave Shaper, and Soundgoodizer. There is no [[piano roll]], playlist ability, automation, audio recording, or VST/[[ReWire]] client.<ref name=\"editions\">{{cite news|title=Editions|url=http://www.image-line.com/flstudio-feature-comparison/|publisher=[[Image-Line Software]]|website=image-line.com|accessdate=2015-04-26}}</ref>\n* '''Fruity Edition''' \u2013 The Fruity Edition allows users to access the playlist, [[piano roll]], and event automation features, which allow for complex and lengthy arranging and sequencing. There is also VST/ReWire support so that FL Studio can be an instrument in other hosts such as Cubase, Sonic Solutions, [[Logic Studio|Logic]], and other software. As of version 10.0 this edition includes the Simsynth Live [[synthesizer]] instrument, the DrumSynth live percussion synthesizer, the DX10FM synthesizer, and the Wasp/Wasp XT synthesizers. There is no audio recording feature.<ref name=\"editions\"/> In FL Studio 12, this was given (spline-based) automation.\n* '''Producer Edition''' \u2013 The Producer Edition includes all of the features of the Fruity Edition, as well as full recording for internal and external audio and post-production tools. It allows for hand-drawing point and curve based [[spline (mathematics)|splines]] (referred to as \"Automation Clips\"). Plugins include Edison, Slicex (loop slicer and re-arranger), [[Sytrus]], Maximus, Vocodex and Synthmaker. It also allows for waveform viewing of audio clips and the ability to add cue points.<ref name=\"editions\"/>\n* '''Signature Bundle''' \u2013 This edition includes the Producer Edition as well as a series of plugins such as the Fruity Video player, DirectWave Sampler, Harmless, NewTone, Pitcher, Gross Beat and the Hardcore Guitar Effects Suite.<ref name=\"editions\"/>\n* '''All Plugins Bundle''' \u2013 The All Plugins Bundle includes the Signature Bundle along with extra plugins, particularly synthesizers.\n* '''Free Demo''' \u2013 The free demo version includes all of the program's features, all plugins, and allows users to render project audio to [[WAV]], [[MIDI]], [[MP3]], and [[Ogg|OGG]].<ref name=\"what\" /> However, there are several drawbacks to this limitation as projects saved in demo mode will only open fully once FL Studio and plugins have been registered. Also, instrument presets cannot be saved and the audio output of some instruments will cut out momentarily every few minutes until the program and its plugins have been registered.<ref name=\"FL Studio 12.5 BETA 3\" />\n* '''Mobile''' \u2013 On June 21, 2011, Image-Line released [[FL Studio Mobile]] for iOS and in April 2013 for Android. Both support the ability to create multi-track projects on mobile devices including [[iPod Touch]]es, [[iPhone]]s, [[iPad]]s.,<ref name=\"mobile\"/> Android 2.3.3 and higher Smart Phones and Tablets.\n* '''Groove''' \u2013 On September 2, 2013, A new standalone app for Windows 8 was released.

The song \"Cooney vs. Munly\" on ''Jimmy Carter Syndrome'' (2002) was written as a tribute to him.<ref name=\"Munly Splendid\" /> In fact, the ''Jimmy Carter Syndrome'' album may have been named as such due to the comparisons he draws between the way he and former U.S. president [[Jimmy Carter]] grew up: \n\n{{quote|''\"We grew up similarly...he had a nanny who sort of raised him.

In a 2012 interview with [[Westword]], he says that his brother took him to the [[Bob Johnson (ice hockey, born 1931)|Bob Johnson]] ice hockey school to play.<ref name=\"Munly Acting Westword\" />\n\n===Interest in music===\n\nHis interest in music initially stemmed from boredom as he was recovering from an ice hockey injury. He also had some familial ties: his father and grandfather owned and played banjos, and his father also made a [[dulcimer]] for his mother as a gift, although she did not play it.<ref name=\"Munly Splendid\" />\n\nWhile recuperating from said injury, Munly taught himself how to play his father's 19th century-era [[banjo]], which was technically off-limits to handle,<ref name=\"Munly on Vera\" /> although his mother knew what was going on.

It is a role that he is happy to take on by himself, believing that a band's success is dependent on playing to individual strengths rather than collaboration with members on each part of an album's creation.<ref name=\"DBUK Marquee\" /> He also says that he is \"selfish\" with his written material and serious about lyrical preservation.<ref name=\"Munly Acting Westword\" />\n\nHe expanded on his way of songwriting in a 2019 interview with Sadwave, a Russian publication:\n\n{{quote|''\"From the very beginning, I understand where and why I'm writing a song. There is no complicated science. When you have been doing this for so many years, you bring the skill to automatism. I can start with a melody, but I can with a text \u2013 I always have a lot of words, I write a lot. I constantly find common themes in my songs, but I never had the feeling that I was working on a pattern. It would be immoral and unnatural, and I would not want to. I have characters who constantly come back, wander from song to song. But I try to change the angle, write on behalf of different people. On behalf of all sad people.\"'' <ref name=\"Munly Sadwave\">{{cite news |last1=Kurkin |first1=Dmitry |title=Jay Manley [sic] (DBUK): 'I try to write on behalf of all sad people' |url=https://sadwave.com/2019/02/jay-munli/ |accessdate=5 April 2020 |work=sad wave |date=February 8, 2019 |ref=Munly Sadwave |language=Russian}}</ref>}}\n\n===Musical themes and genres===\n\nHis music has ties to [[alt-country]] and [[Gothabilly|Gothic-Americana]]. Common themes include religion, violence and dysfunctional relationships; often they are intertwined. His increasingly narrative songs often feature banjo and, since the recording of his fourth album, ''Jimmy Carter Syndrome'', strings.\n\nOne topic that Munly deliberately does not write about is politics, since he \"hates\" music that veers into that kind of territory.<ref name=\"A Munly Man\" /> However, he admits that the stories and songs that he writes can be applied to real-world events in a way that coincidentally fits.<ref name=\"DBUK Marquee\" />\n\n===Vocals===\n\nTechnically, Munly is a baritone, but his [[vocal range]] extends from A1 to F5.<ref name=\"Munly Vocal Range 1\">{{cite news |title=Jay \"Munly\" Munly |url=https://therangeplanet.proboards.com/thread/14/jay-munly |accessdate=9 April 2020 |work=The Range Planet |date=September 22, 2019 |ref=Munly Vocal Range 1}}</ref> Audio samples can be found on Youtube.<ref name=\"Munly Vocal Range 2\">{{cite web |title=The Vocal Range of Jay Munly |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_hVoW0VwVA |via=YouTube |accessdate=April 9, 2020 |ref=Munly Vocal Range 2}}</ref> \n\nEarly on in his solo career, he sang at a higher register than what he usually sounds like on his later records. \n\nOn the expanded DVDs of ''Munly & The Lee Lewis Harlots'' (2004) and ''The Commandments According to SCAC'' (2016), Munly read the lyrics of each song as poetry, employing a wide range of voices to the characters in his songs.\n\n===Controversial lyrics===\n\nAs stated in a few interviews, people have found some of Munly's material controversial and politically incorrect. It is important to note that in most cases, the words and phrases used (as well as the views they represent) are that of the fictional characters that Munly creates, not of Munly himself.\n\nExamples:\n\n* ''\"Boys with tattoos can't be Jews\"'' \u2013 from \"Kidneys Running Dry\" on ''Blurry'' (1996)<ref name=\"A Munly Man\" /><ref name=\"KRD Lyrics\">{{cite web |title=Munly \u2013 Kidneys Running Dry |url=https://genius.com/Munly-kidneys-running-dry-lyrics?__cf_chl_jschl_tk__=bd3ae05fe6c1e2a47c4f0713ffa5a16e71fce6fd-1586308658-0-AacccNM6Up3QUKAwcxWr7moI6buvh28pOpYPxYODrvwTY_F1arxPxbTRgSuWyl4Xdp0ySY_ZseZwWCStv8dumtz5AhmL5llOOnD9_3dv6-XTquwykYgduqCixdMk01PstYrSa8KQZi4SK3emYdNuLlbX4RFCHJbwQ1YRExOJjd6dkKD1_GHgcdfYYDe-vTJWI1uyX_0R8Q64ZevT3n-7A-7f2-ifsSZoF6J2JCq_RT2aMwKoWBxbHjarJrGdvNiZWwohYzH2ba2tN14wf2PwTXEzsdbFCgp-hDaOKuoeEYASB7ZBgYOJT_5LMn8GQ2PkKSfxVXNgggJO-I6ajZK3bMX27bSVAiYaqRheMbR_klyaHJvQPTQvRxAPyOR5CZ1c9A |website=Genius |accessdate=April 7, 2020 |ref=KRD Lyrics}}</ref> <sup>[[#Notes|[a] ]]</sup>\n\n* \"My Darling Sambo\" \u2013 the first track title on ''Jimmy Carter Syndrome'' (2002)<ref name=\"Munly Splendid\" /><ref name=\"JCS Amazon\">{{cite web |title=MUNLY, JAY \u2013 Jimmy Carter Syndrome |url=https://www.amazon.com/Jimmy-Carter-Syndrome-JAY-MUNLY/dp/B000BKWZOI |website=Amazon Music |accessdate=April 7, 2020 |ref=JCS Amazon}}</ref> <sup>[[#Notes|[b] ]]</sup>\n\n* ''\"Paint your blackface/Yeah, won't you put me in your anteroom case/I'll be your n***er/On stage\"'' \u2013 from \"Censer from the Footlights\" on ''Jimmy Carter Syndrome'' (2002)<ref name=\"Munly Splendid\" /><ref name=\"CFTF Lyrics\">{{cite web |title=Jay Munly \u2013 Censer from the Footlights Lyrics |url=http://www.songlyrics.com/jay-munly/censer-from-the-footlights-lyrics/ |website=SongLyrics |accessdate=April 7, 2020 |ref=CFTF Lyrics}}</ref> <sup>[[#Notes|[c] ]]</sup> <sup>[[#Notes|[d] ]]</sup> <sup>[[#Notes|[e] ]]</sup> <sup>[[#Notes|[f] ]]</sup>\n\n* ''\"Then we found ourselves a half-breed/To tell us our fortune today/He painted my hands a deep, dark red/Said 'now boy, you know that you gotta pay'\"'' \u2013 from \"Goose Walking Over My Grave\" on ''Munly & The Lee Lewis Harlots'' (2004)<ref name=\"Munly Birds\">{{cite news |last1=Bradley |first1=Lisa M. |title=A Crack in Its Speak: Fantastic Birds in the Gothic Country Lyrics of Jay Munly |url=http://stonetelling.com/issue8-aug2012/bradley-speak.html |accessdate=April 6, 2020 |work=Stone Telling |issue=Issue No. 8 |date=August 2012 |ref=Munly Birds}}</ref><ref name=\"Goose Lyrics\">{{cite web |title=Lyrics \u2013 Goose Walking Over My Grave |url=https://www.musixmatch.com/lyrics/Munly-The-Lee-Lewis-Harlots/Goose-Walking-Over-My-Grave |website=Musixmatch |accessdate=April 7, 2020 |ref=Goose Lyrics}}</ref> <sup>[[#Notes|[g] ]]</sup>\n\n* \"Cassius Castrato The She-Male of the Men's Prison\" \u2013 the fifth track title on ''Munly & The Lee Lewis Harlots'' (2004)<ref name=\"LLH Album\">{{cite web |title=Munly & The Lee Lewis Harlots |url=https://slimcessnasautoclub.myshopify.com/collections/munly/products/munly-the-lee-lewis-harlots |website=slimcessnasautoclub.myshopify.com |accessdate=April 7, 2020 |ref=LLH Album}}</ref> <sup>[[#Notes|[h] ]]</sup>\n\n==Music career==\n\n===Solo career===\n\nIn the 1990s, Munly started out his music career as a solo artist.

''Munly de Dar He'' and ''Galvanized Yankee'' were also released through Top Notch in 1997 and 1999, respectively. His fourth and final solo album, ''Jimmy Carter Syndrome'', was released through [[Alternative Tentacles]] in 2002. Each of these albums were re-mastered by Bob Ferbrache and re-released as limited editions through Smooch Records in 2006. Only 1,000 copies of each were printed.\n\nHe has worked with several musicians that are featured on his albums, such as John Ellison of The Reejers and Chris Mars of The Replacements.<ref name=\"A Munly Man\" /> However, he makes a point of not listing the exact musical contributions of each member in liner notes, preferring the simplicity of the 'Modern Library book' aesthetic.<ref name=\"Munly Splendid\" />\n\nAlthough Munly is the primary vocalist and lyricist on each of his albums, he hesitates to call himself a \"singer-songwriter\":\n\n''{{quote|\"It's kind of rough being a solo artist.

The song \"Cooney vs. Munly\" on ''Jimmy Carter Syndrome'' (2002) was written as a tribute to him.<ref name=\"Munly Splendid\" /> In fact, the ''Jimmy Carter Syndrome'' album may have been named as such due to the comparisons he draws between the way he and former U.S. president [[Jimmy Carter]] grew up: \n\n{{quote|''\"We grew up similarly...he had a nanny who sort of raised him.

In a 2012 interview with [[Westword]], he says that his brother took him to the [[Bob Johnson (ice hockey, born 1931)|Bob Johnson]] ice hockey school to play.<ref name=\"Munly Acting Westword\" />\n\n===Interest in music===\n\nHis interest in music initially stemmed from boredom as he was recovering from an ice hockey injury. He also had some familial ties: his father and grandfather owned and played banjos, and his father also made a [[dulcimer]] for his mother as a gift, although she did not play it.<ref name=\"Munly Splendid\" />\n\nWhile recuperating from said injury, Munly taught himself how to play his father's 19th century-era [[banjo]], which was technically off-limits to handle,<ref name=\"Munly on Vera\" /> although his mother knew what was going on.

It is a role that he is happy to take on by himself, believing that a band's success is dependent on playing to individual strengths rather than collaboration with members on each part of an album's creation.<ref name=\"DBUK Marquee\" /> He also says that he is \"selfish\" with his written material and serious about lyrical preservation.<ref name=\"Munly Acting Westword\" />\n\nHe expanded on his way of songwriting in a 2019 interview with Sadwave, a Russian publication:\n\n{{quote|''\"From the very beginning, I understand where and why I'm writing a song. There is no complicated science. When you have been doing this for so many years, you bring the skill to automatism. I can start with a melody, but I can with a text \u2013 I always have a lot of words, I write a lot. I constantly find common themes in my songs, but I never had the feeling that I was working on a pattern. It would be immoral and unnatural, and I would not want to. I have characters who constantly come back, wander from song to song. But I try to change the angle, write on behalf of different people. On behalf of all sad people.\"'' <ref name=\"Munly Sadwave\">{{cite news |last1=Kurkin |first1=Dmitry |title=Jay Manley [sic] (DBUK): 'I try to write on behalf of all sad people' |url=https://sadwave.com/2019/02/jay-munli/ |accessdate=5 April 2020 |work=sad wave |date=February 8, 2019 |ref=Munly Sadwave |language=Russian}}</ref>}}\n\n===Musical themes and genres===\n\nHis music has ties to [[alt-country]] and [[Gothabilly|Gothic-Americana]]. Common themes include religion, violence and dysfunctional relationships; often they are intertwined. His increasingly narrative songs often feature banjo and, since the recording of his fourth album, ''Jimmy Carter Syndrome'', strings.\n\nOne topic that Munly deliberately does not write about is politics, since he \"hates\" music that veers into that kind of territory.<ref name=\"A Munly Man\" /> However, he admits that the stories and songs that he writes can be applied to real-world events in a way that coincidentally fits.<ref name=\"DBUK Marquee\" />\n\n===Vocals===\n\nTechnically, Munly is a baritone, but his [[vocal range]] extends from A1 to F5.<ref name=\"Munly Vocal Range 1\">{{cite news |title=Jay \"Munly\" Munly |url=https://therangeplanet.proboards.com/thread/14/jay-munly |accessdate=9 April 2020 |work=The Range Planet |date=September 22, 2019 |ref=Munly Vocal Range 1}}</ref> Audio samples can be found on Youtube.<ref name=\"Munly Vocal Range 2\">{{cite web |title=The Vocal Range of Jay Munly |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_hVoW0VwVA |via=YouTube |accessdate=April 9, 2020 |ref=Munly Vocal Range 2}}</ref> \n\nEarly on in his solo career, he sang at a higher register than what he usually sounds like on his later records. \n\nOn the expanded DVDs of ''Munly & The Lee Lewis Harlots'' (2004) and ''The Commandments According to SCAC'' (2016), Munly read the lyrics of each song as poetry, employing a wide range of voices to the characters in his songs.\n\n===Controversial lyrics===\n\nAs stated in a few interviews, people have found some of Munly's material controversial and politically incorrect. It is important to note that in most cases, the words and phrases used (as well as the views they represent) are that of the fictional characters that Munly creates, not of Munly himself.\n\nExamples:\n\n* ''\"Boys with tattoos can't be Jews\"'' \u2013 from \"Kidneys Running Dry\" on ''Blurry'' (1996)<ref name=\"A Munly Man\" /><ref name=\"KRD Lyrics\">{{cite web |title=Munly \u2013 Kidneys Running Dry |url=https://genius.com/Munly-kidneys-running-dry-lyrics?__cf_chl_jschl_tk__=bd3ae05fe6c1e2a47c4f0713ffa5a16e71fce6fd-1586308658-0-AacccNM6Up3QUKAwcxWr7moI6buvh28pOpYPxYODrvwTY_F1arxPxbTRgSuWyl4Xdp0ySY_ZseZwWCStv8dumtz5AhmL5llOOnD9_3dv6-XTquwykYgduqCixdMk01PstYrSa8KQZi4SK3emYdNuLlbX4RFCHJbwQ1YRExOJjd6dkKD1_GHgcdfYYDe-vTJWI1uyX_0R8Q64ZevT3n-7A-7f2-ifsSZoF6J2JCq_RT2aMwKoWBxbHjarJrGdvNiZWwohYzH2ba2tN14wf2PwTXEzsdbFCgp-hDaOKuoeEYASB7ZBgYOJT_5LMn8GQ2PkKSfxVXNgggJO-I6ajZK3bMX27bSVAiYaqRheMbR_klyaHJvQPTQvRxAPyOR5CZ1c9A |website=Genius |accessdate=April 7, 2020 |ref=KRD Lyrics}}</ref> <sup>[[#Notes|[a] ]]</sup>\n\n* \"My Darling Sambo\" \u2013 the first track title on ''Jimmy Carter Syndrome'' (2002)<ref name=\"Munly Splendid\" /><ref name=\"JCS Amazon\">{{cite web |title=MUNLY, JAY \u2013 Jimmy Carter Syndrome |url=https://www.amazon.com/Jimmy-Carter-Syndrome-JAY-MUNLY/dp/B000BKWZOI |website=Amazon Music |accessdate=April 7, 2020 |ref=JCS Amazon}}</ref> <sup>[[#Notes|[b] ]]</sup>\n\n* ''\"Paint your blackface/Yeah, won't you put me in your anteroom case/I'll be your n***er/On stage\"'' \u2013 from \"Censer from the Footlights\" on ''Jimmy Carter Syndrome'' (2002)<ref name=\"Munly Splendid\" /><ref name=\"CFTF Lyrics\">{{cite web |title=Jay Munly \u2013 Censer from the Footlights Lyrics |url=http://www.songlyrics.com/jay-munly/censer-from-the-footlights-lyrics/ |website=SongLyrics |accessdate=April 7, 2020 |ref=CFTF Lyrics}}</ref> <sup>[[#Notes|[c] ]]</sup> <sup>[[#Notes|[d] ]]</sup> <sup>[[#Notes|[e] ]]</sup> <sup>[[#Notes|[f] ]]</sup>\n\n* ''\"Then we found ourselves a half-breed/To tell us our fortune today/He painted my hands a deep, dark red/Said 'now boy, you know that you gotta pay'\"'' \u2013 from \"Goose Walking Over My Grave\" on ''Munly & The Lee Lewis Harlots'' (2004)<ref name=\"Munly Birds\">{{cite news |last1=Bradley |first1=Lisa M. |title=A Crack in Its Speak: Fantastic Birds in the Gothic Country Lyrics of Jay Munly |url=http://stonetelling.com/issue8-aug2012/bradley-speak.html |accessdate=April 6, 2020 |work=Stone Telling |issue=Issue No. 8 |date=August 2012 |ref=Munly Birds}}</ref><ref name=\"Goose Lyrics\">{{cite web |title=Lyrics \u2013 Goose Walking Over My Grave |url=https://www.musixmatch.com/lyrics/Munly-The-Lee-Lewis-Harlots/Goose-Walking-Over-My-Grave |website=Musixmatch |accessdate=April 7, 2020 |ref=Goose Lyrics}}</ref> <sup>[[#Notes|[g] ]]</sup>\n\n* \"Cassius Castrato The She-Male of the Men's Prison\" \u2013 the fifth track title on ''Munly & The Lee Lewis Harlots'' (2004)<ref name=\"LLH Album\">{{cite web |title=Munly & The Lee Lewis Harlots |url=https://slimcessnasautoclub.myshopify.com/collections/munly/products/munly-the-lee-lewis-harlots |website=slimcessnasautoclub.myshopify.com |accessdate=April 7, 2020 |ref=LLH Album}}</ref> <sup>[[#Notes|[h] ]]</sup>\n\n==Music career==\n\n===Solo career===\n\nIn the 1990s, Munly started out his music career as a solo artist.

He also shared a 7-inch vinyl album with [[Roger Manning]].<ref name=\"A Munly Man\" />\n\nHe released his debut solo album, ''Blurry'', in 1996 through Top Notch, an imprint of [[What Are Records?]]. ''Munly de Dar He'' and ''Galvanized Yankee'' were also released through Top Notch in 1997 and 1999, respectively. His fourth and final solo album, ''Jimmy Carter Syndrome'', was released through [[Alternative Tentacles]] in 2002. Each of these albums were re-mastered by Bob Ferbrache and re-released as limited editions through Smooch Records in 2006. Only 1,000 copies of each were printed.\n\nHe has worked with several musicians that are featured on his albums, such as John Ellison of The Reejers and Chris Mars of The Replacements.<ref name=\"A Munly Man\" /> However, he makes a point of not listing the exact musical contributions of each member in liner notes, preferring the simplicity of the 'Modern Library book' aesthetic.<ref name=\"Munly Splendid\" />\n\nAlthough Munly is the primary vocalist and lyricist on each of his albums, he hesitates to call himself a \"singer-songwriter\":\n\n''{{quote|\"It's kind of rough being a solo artist.

''Chiafalo'' deals with electors who received {{USD|1,000}} fines for voting contrary to state law in the state of [[Washington (state)|Washington]]. The case was originally consolidated with ''[[Colorado Department of State v.

The Court ruled in favor of state laws requiring electors to pledge to vote for the winning candidate in order to be certified as electors, as well as removing electors who refuse to pledge.

At an initial hearing, an [[administrative law judge]] upheld the fines, stating he had no [[jurisdiction]] to rule on constitutional arguments, only whether the fines were applied in accordance with state law.

Lessig argued that both cases offered the Supreme Court the opportunity to rule on the matter of faithless elector laws outside the realm of a contested election where their ruling would have a direct impact on the outcome, as in ''[[Bush v. Gore]]''. By clarifying how the Electoral College actually functions, Lessig and Equal Citizens hope to spur Electoral College reform via either a [[Amending the United States Constitution|constitutional amendment]] or the [[National Popular Vote Interstate Compact]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Elector's Freedom |url=https://equalcitizens.us/electors-freedom/ |website=Equal Citizens |accessdate=29 February 2020}}</ref> In the latter case, electors from states in the compact combined with electors pledged to the popular vote winner in non-compact states would conceivably create a buffer in electoral votes such that it would take an unprecedented number of faithless electors to threaten the electoral college majority of the popular vote winner.\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:United States Supreme Court cases]]\n[[Category:2020 in United States case law]]\n[[Category:United States One Person, One Vote Legal Doctrine]]\n[[Category:Colorado law]]\n[[Category:Washington (state) law]]\n[[Category:Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign]]\n[[Category:Stop Trump movement]]\n[[Category:United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit cases]]\n[[Category:United States presidential elections in Colorado]]\n[[Category:United States presidential elections in Washington (state)]]\n[[Category:Electoral College (United States)]]\n[[Category:United States Constitution Article Two case law]]\n[[Category:United States elections case law]]\n[[Category:Controversies of the 2016 United States presidential election]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Pending United States Supreme Court case}}\n{{use mdy dates|date=January 2020}}\n{{Infobox SCOTUS case\n  |Litigants=Chiafalo v.

At the first trial at the [[Thurston County, Washington|Thurston County]] Superior Court in 2017, the judge ruled against the constitutional argument and deemed the fines permissible.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.spokesman.com/stories/2017/dec/13/faithless-electors-1000-fines-upheld/ | title = \u2018Faithless\u2019 electors $1,000 fines upheld | first=  Jim | last =Camden  |date = December 13, 2017 | accessdate= February 26, 2020 | work = [[The Spokesman-Review]] }}</ref> The three electors then appealed to the [[Washington Supreme Court]], which in May 2019 upheld the lower court ruling with an 8-1 vote.

Lessig argued that both cases offered the Supreme Court the opportunity to rule on the matter of faithless elector laws outside the realm of a contested election where their ruling would have a direct impact on the outcome, as in ''[[Bush v. Gore]]''. By clarifying how the Electoral College actually functions, Lessig and Equal Citizens hope to spur Electoral College reform via either a [[Amending the United States Constitution|constitutional amendment]] or the [[National Popular Vote Interstate Compact]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Elector's Freedom |url=https://equalcitizens.us/electors-freedom/ |website=Equal Citizens |accessdate=29 February 2020}}</ref> In the latter case, electors from states in the compact combined with electors pledged to the popular vote winner in non-compact states would conceivably create a buffer in electoral votes such that it would take an unprecedented number of faithless electors to threaten the electoral college majority of the popular vote winner.\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:United States Supreme Court cases]]\n[[Category:2020 in United States case law]]\n[[Category:United States One Person, One Vote Legal Doctrine]]\n[[Category:Colorado law]]\n[[Category:Washington (state) law]]\n[[Category:Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign]]\n[[Category:Stop Trump movement]]\n[[Category:United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit cases]]\n[[Category:United States presidential elections in Colorado]]\n[[Category:United States presidential elections in Washington (state)]]\n[[Category:Electoral College (United States)]]\n[[Category:United States Constitution Article Two case law]]\n[[Category:United States elections case law]]\n[[Category:Controversies of the 2016 United States presidential election]]\n", "name_user": "Mdewman6", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eCase history", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiafalo_v._Washington"}

The Ridge is on the territory of the [[Uyghurs|Uyghur]] and [[Raiymbek District|Raiymbek]] districts of the [[Almaty Region|Almaty region]] which falls within the [[Republic of Kazakhstan]] and [[China]]. The total length of the Ridge is 310 km, 160 km of which lies in Kazakhstan. The width of the Ridge is about 40\u201350 km. The highest point of the range is Mount Aspan at 3,652 m.\nThe Ridge is adjacent to the K\u00fcng\u00f6y Ala-Too Range in the West and the Narat Ridge in the East. The Northern slopes of the Ridge pass into the Ili Valley. Ketmen Ridge forms the southern border of Semirechye. \n\nThe Ridge is composed of igneous and sedimentary rocks, such as effusions, [[granite]], and [[limestone]]. The slopes are steep with gentle peaks below the snow line. The Ridge has a [[permafrost]] zone but does not have glaciation or snowfields. It contains [[steppe]] and [[taiga]] forests, which consist mainly of spruce trees and meadows in high-altitude zones. At the foot of the southern slope of the ridge, steppe bison remains have been found {{citation needed|date=April 2020}}.\n\nThe eponymous Ketmen pass is located at an altitude of 3,040 meters above sea level in the Eastern part of the mountain range. A caravan trail from the Ili valley to the Kegen-Tekes hollow runs through the pass, which connects the Northern slope in the Ketmen gorge and southern slope of the Ridge of the Shalkudysu river valley.\n\n==Flora and Fauna==\nThe Ketmen ridge has mountainous flora; Research found the Ketmen ridge home to 1890 species of vascular plants, which are angiosperms, dicots, and monocots. <ref>Sadyrova GA.

The Ridge is on the territory of the [[Uyghurs|Uyghur]] and [[Raiymbek District|Raiymbek]] districts of the [[Almaty Region|Almaty region]] which falls within the [[Republic of Kazakhstan]] and [[China]]. The total length of the Ridge is 310 km, 160 km of which lies in Kazakhstan. The width of the Ridge is about 40\u201350 km. The highest point of the range is Mount Aspan at 3,652 m.[2]\nThe Ridge is adjacent to the K\u00fcng\u00f6y Ala-Too Range in the West and the Narat Ridge in the East. The Northern slopes of the Ridge pass into the Ili Valley. Ketmen Ridge forms the southern border of Semirechye. \n\nThe Ridge is composed of igneous and sedimentary rocks, such as effusions, [[granite]], and [[limestone]]. The slopes are steep with gentle peaks below the snow line. The Ridge has a [[permafrost]] zone but does not have glaciation or snowfields. It contains [[steppe]] and [[taiga]] forests, which consist mainly of spruce trees and meadows in high-altitude zones. At the foot of the southern slope of the ridge, steppe bison remains have been found {{citation needed|date=April 2020}}.\n\nThe eponymous Ketmen pass is located at an altitude of 3,040 meters above sea level in the Eastern part of the mountain range. A caravan trail from the Ili valley to the Kegen-Tekes hollow runs through the pass, which connects the Northern slope in the Ketmen gorge and southern slope of the Ridge of the Shalkudysu river valley.\n\n==Flora and Fauna==\nThe Ketmen ridge has mountainous flora; Research found the Ketmen ridge home to 1890 species of vascular plants, which are angiosperms, dicots, and monocots. <ref>Sadyrova GA.

His father, Wilfred Everett Bixby II, was a store clerk and his mother, Jane (n\u00e9e McFarland) Bixby, was a senior manager at [[I. Magnin|I. Magnin & Co.]] In 1942, when Bixby was eight years old, his father enlisted in the Navy during World War II and traveled to the South Pacific. While in the seventh grade, Bixby attended Grace Cathedral and sang in the church's choir. In one notable incident, he shot the bishop using a slingshot during a service and was kicked out of the choir. In 1946, his mother encouraged him to take ballroom dance lessons and from there he started dancing all around the city. While dancing, he attended [[Lowell High School (San Francisco)|Lowell High School]], where he perfected his oratory and dramatic skills as a member of the Lowell Forensic Society. Though he received average grades, he also competed in high-school speech tournaments regionally. After graduation from high school in 1952, against his parents' wishes, he majored in drama at [[City College of San Francisco]].<ref name=nyt/>\n\nDuring the [[Korean War]], Bixby was drafted shortly after his eighteenth birthday. Rather than report to the [[United States Army]], Bixby joined the [[United States Marine Corps Reserve]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.ancestry.com |title=U.S. Marine Corps Muster Rolls, 1798-1958, entry for Wilfred B.

During the 1970s, he made guest appearances on television series such as ''[[Ironside (TV series)|Ironside]]'', ''[[Insight (TV series)|Insight]]'', ''[[Barbary Coast (TV series)|Barbary Coast]]'', ''[[The Love Boat]]'', ''[[Medical Center (TV series)|Medical Center]]'', four episodes of ''[[Love, American Style]]'', ''[[Fantasy Island]]'', and two episodes each of ''[[The Streets of San Francisco]]'' and [[Rod Serling]]'s ''[[Night Gallery]]''.\n\n===''My Favorite Martian'' and other early roles===\n[[File:Bill Bixby My Favorite Martian 1965.JPG|thumb|upright|Bixby as Tim O'Hara in ''[[My Favorite Martian]]'', when an accident turns Uncle Martin back into a baby (Season 2, Episode 6)]]\nBixby took the role of young reporter Tim O'Hara in the 1963 CBS sitcom, ''[[My Favorite Martian]]'', in which he co-starred with [[Ray Walston]]. By 1966, though, high production costs forced the series to come to an end after 107 episodes. After the cancellation of ''Martian'', Bixby starred in four movies: ''[[Ride Beyond Vengeance]]'', ''[[Doctor, You've Got to Be Kidding!]]'', and two of [[Elvis Presley]]'s movies, ''[[Clambake (film)|Clambake]]'' and ''[[Speedway (1968 film)|Speedway]]''. He turned down the role as [[Marlo Thomas]]'s boyfriend in the successful ''[[That Girl]]'', though he later guest-starred in the show, and starred in two failed pilots.\n\n===''The Courtship of Eddie's Father''===\nIn 1969, Bixby starred in his second high-profile television role, as Tom Corbett in ''[[The Courtship of Eddie's Father]]'', a [[comedy-drama]] on ABC. The series concerned a widowed father raising a young son, managing a major syndicated magazine, and at the same time trying to re-enter the dating scene. This series was in the vein of other 1960s and 1970s sitcoms that dealt with [[widower]]hood, such as ''[[The Andy Griffith Show]]'' and ''[[My Three Sons]]''. Eddie was played by novice actor [[Brandon Cruz]]. The pair developed a close rapport that translated to an off-camera friendship as well. The core cast was rounded out by [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]]-winning actress [[Miyoshi Umeki]], who played the role of Tom's housekeeper, Mrs. Livingston; [[James Komack]] (one of the series' producers) as Norman Tinker, Tom's pseudo-hippie, quirky photographer, and actress Kristina Holland as Tom's secretary, Tina. One episode of the series co-starred Bixby's future wife, [[Brenda Benet]], as one of Tom's girlfriends.\n\n[[File:Courtship of Eddies Father 1969.JPG|thumb|left|upright|With ''The Courtship of Eddie's Father'' co-stars, [[Brandon Cruz]] and [[Miyoshi Umeki]]]]\nBixby was nominated for the [[Emmy Award]] for Lead Actor in a Comedy Series in 1971. The following year, he won the Parents Without Partners Exemplary Service Award for 1972.\n\nBixby made his directorial debut on the sitcom in 1970, directing eight episodes. ABC canceled the sitcom in 1972 at the end of season three.\n\nAfter the show was canceled, Bixby and Cruz remained in contact, with Cruz making a guest appearance on Bixby's later series ''[[The Incredible Hulk (1978 TV series)|The Incredible Hulk]]''. The death of Bixby's only child, in 1981, drew Bixby and Cruz closer still. The two remained in touch until Bixby's death in 1993. In 1995, Cruz named his own son Lincoln Bixby Cruz.\n\nBrandon Cruz said of the show which developed a professional father-son relationship, compared to that of ''The Andy Griffith Show'', \"We dealt with issues that were talked about but were never brought up on television. Bill wasn't the first actor to portray a single widowed father, but he became one of the popular ones, because of his easy-going way of this crazy little kid.\" Prior to Bixby's promotion to director, Brandon said, \"He was looking for the best dolly grip, along with the boom operator that if something was called specifically and failed, Bill could be easily angry.\" On the kind of relationship Bill had wanted with his co-star, Brandon also said, \"Bill would never speak down to me. Bill treated me as an equal. He made sure that we had a lot of time together, just so he could kinda crawl inside my head and see what actually made a kid tick.\" Upon Bill's real-life father's death in 1971, Cruz stated: \"He had that type of mentality that the show must go on, thinking it was just a great T.V. show, after he broke down weeping.\"<ref>{{cite web | author= | title=Bill Bixby biography| url=http://www.biography.com/people/bill-bixby-9542610 | work=A+E Networks Digital| date= | accessdate=January 27, 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn a 2011 interview with Marilyn Beck and Stacy Jenel Smith about how Bill Bixby's fame was supposed to posthumously honor him for a Star on The Hollywood Walk of Fame, Cruz said, \"When I found out they were putting this out, I thought, 'It's about time.' Bill Bixby had an amazing body of work, not only ''Courtship of Eddie's Father,'' but ''My Favorite Martian,'' ''The Magician,'' ''The Incredible Hulk'' and so many other things, as an actor, as a director \u2014 and he never got an Emmy. He's never been recognized posthumously by the Academy. And he doesn't have a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. That is criminal.... There are people who have stars that, not to be blunt, but I wouldn't bother spitting on their stars. Bill's talent would take a couple of blocks of stars compared to them. It really demeans the whole thing that Bill is not included.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://becksmithhollywood.com/2011/10/brandon-cruz-angry-over-hollywood-forgetting-bill-bixby/comment-page-1|title=Brandon Cruz Angry Over Hollywood Forgetting Bill Bixby|publisher=BeckSmithHollywood.com|date=October 18, 2011 |accessdate=March 7, 2018}}</ref>\n\n===1973 to 1977===\nIn 1973, Bixby starred in ''[[The Magician (American TV series)|The Magician]]''. The series was well liked but lasted only one season. An accomplished amateur magician himself, he hosted several TV specials in the mid-1970s which featured other amateur magicians, and was a respected member of the Hollywood magic community, belonging to [[The Magic Castle]], an exclusive club for magicians. During the show's popular, although short-lived, production, Bixby invited a few old friends along to co-star such as [[Pamela Britton]] (in her final role), [[Kristina Holland]] and Ralph O'Hara.\n\nAlso in 1973, he starred in ''[[Steambath (play)|Steambath]]'', a play by author [[Bruce Jay Friedman]], on [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] with [[Valerie Perrine]] and Jose Perez.\n\nBixby became a popular game-show panelist, appearing mostly on ''[[Password (game show)|Password]]'' and ''[[The Hollywood Squares]]''. He was also a panelist on the 1974 revival of ''[[Masquerade Party]]'' hosted by [[Richard Dawson]]. He had also appeared with Dawson on ''Cop-Out''. In 1974-1975, he directed four episodes of the eighth season of ''[[Mannix]]'', guest-starring as Mannix's friend-turned-villain in one of the episodes.\n\nIn 1975, he co-starred with [[Tim Conway]] and [[Don Knotts]] in the Disney movie ''[[The Apple Dumpling Gang (film)|The Apple Dumpling Gang]]'', which was well received by the public.\n\nReturning to television, Bixby worked with [[Susan Blakely]] on ''[[Rich Man, Poor Man (miniseries)|Rich Man, Poor Man]]'', a highly successful television miniseries in 1976. He played a daredevil stunt pilot in an episode of the short-lived 1976 [[CBS]] adventure series ''[[Spencer's Pilots]]'', starring [[Gene Evans]]. In 1977, he co-starred in the pilot for the television series ''[[Fantasy Island]]''; starred in \"No Way Out\", the final episode of the NBC anthology series ''[[Quinn Martin's Tales of the Unexpected]]'' (known in the [[United Kingdom]] as ''Twist in the Tale'');<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ctva.biz/US/Anthology/TalesOfTheUnexpected.htm|title=CTVA US Anthology - \"Tales of the Unexpected\" (Quinn Martin/NBC)(1977)|website=ctva.biz|access-date=August 17, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140819083515/http://ctva.biz/US/Anthology/TalesOfTheUnexpected.htm|archive-date=August 19, 2014|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> and appeared with [[Donna Mills]], [[Richard Jaeckel]], and [[William Shatner]] in the last episode, \"The Scarlet Ribbon\", of NBC's Western series ''[[The Oregon Trail (TV series)|The Oregon Trail]]'', starring [[Rod Taylor]] and [[Andrew Stevens]]. Bixby directed two episodes of ''The Oregon Trail''.\n\nIn 1976, he was honored with two [[Emmy Award]] nominations, one for Outstanding Lead Actor for a Single Appearance in Drama or Comedy for ''The Streets of San Francisco'' and the other for Outstanding Single Performance by a Supporting Actor in Comedy or Drama Series for ''Rich Man, Poor Man''.\n\nBixby hosted ''[[Once Upon a Classic]]'' on [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] from 1976 to 1980.\n\n===''The Incredible Hulk''===\nBixby starred in the role of Dr. David Banner in the pilot movie, ''The Incredible Hulk'', based on the [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]] [[Marvel Comics|Marvel]] characters.

The pilot also starred [[Susan Sullivan]] as Dr. Elaina Marks, who tries to help the conflicted and widowed Dr. Banner overcome his \"problem\", and falls in love with him in the process. In a retrospective on ''The Incredible Hulk'', [[Glenn Greenberg]] declared Bixby's performance to be the series's \"foremost\" strength, elaborating that he \"masterfully conveyed the profound loneliness and tragedy of Dr. Banner while also bringing to the role an abundance of warmth, intelligence, humor, nobility, likability, and above all else, humanity.\"<ref name=\"Back70\">{{cite journal| last=Glenn| first=Greenberg| authorlink=Glenn Greenberg| date=February 2014| title=The Televised Hulk| journal=[[Back Issue!]]| issue=70| pages=19\u201326| publisher=[[TwoMorrows Publishing]]}}</ref>\n\nDuring the series' run, Bixby invited two of his longtime friends, [[Ray Walston]] and [[Brandon Cruz]], to guest-star with him in different episodes of the series. He also worked on the series with his friend, movie actress [[Mariette Hartley]], who later starred with Bixby in his final series, ''[[Goodnight, Beantown]]'' in 1983. Hartley appears in the well-regarded double-length episode \"Married\",<ref name=\"Back70\"/> and subsequently won an Emmy Award for her guest appearance. Future star [[Loni Anderson]] also guest starred with Bixby during the first season. Bixby directed one episode of the series, \"Bring Me the Head of the Hulk\" in 1980 (original airdate: January 9, 1981). The series was canceled after the following season, but leftover episodes aired as late as the next June. Bixby later executive-produced and reprised the role in three television movies \u2013 ''[[The Incredible Hulk Returns]]'', ''[[The Trial of the Incredible Hulk]]'', and ''[[The Death of the Incredible Hulk]]'' \u2013 the last two of which he also directed, and the first of which he has been said to have unofficially co-directed.<ref name=\"Back70\"/>\n\n===Later work===\nBixby was executive producer and co-star of the short-lived sitcom ''[[Goodnight, Beantown]]'' (1983\u201384).

From 1983 to 1984, he hosted a documentary series for [[Nickelodeon]] entitled ''[[Against the Odds (TV series)|Against the Odds]]''.

His father, Wilfred Everett Bixby II, was a store clerk and his mother, Jane (n\u00e9e McFarland) Bixby, was a senior manager at [[I. Magnin|I. Magnin & Co.]] In 1942, when Bixby was eight years old, his father enlisted in the Navy during World War II and traveled to the South Pacific. While in the seventh grade, Bixby attended Grace Cathedral and sang in the church's choir. In one notable incident, he shot the bishop using a slingshot during a service and was kicked out of the choir. In 1946, his mother encouraged him to take ballroom dance lessons and from there he started dancing all around the city. While dancing, he attended [[Lowell High School (San Francisco)|Lowell High School]], where he perfected his oratory and dramatic skills as a member of the Lowell Forensic Society. Though he received average grades, he also competed in high-school speech tournaments regionally. After graduation from high school in 1952, against his parents' wishes, he majored in drama at [[City College of San Francisco]].<ref name=nyt/>\n\nDuring the [[Korean War]], Bixby was drafted shortly after his eighteenth birthday. Rather than report to the [[United States Army]], Bixby joined the [[United States Marine Corps Reserve]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.ancestry.com |title=U.S. Marine Corps Muster Rolls, 1798-1958, entry for Wilfred B.

During the 1970s, he made guest appearances on television series such as ''[[Ironside (TV series)|Ironside]]'', ''[[Insight (TV series)|Insight]]'', ''[[Barbary Coast (TV series)|Barbary Coast]]'', ''[[The Love Boat]]'', ''[[Medical Center (TV series)|Medical Center]]'', four episodes of ''[[Love, American Style]]'', ''[[Fantasy Island]]'', and two episodes each of ''[[The Streets of San Francisco]]'' and [[Rod Serling]]'s ''[[Night Gallery]]''.\n\n===''My Favorite Martian'' and other early roles===\n[[File:Bill Bixby My Favorite Martian 1965.JPG|thumb|upright|Bixby as Tim O'Hara in ''[[My Favorite Martian]]'', when an accident turns Uncle Martin back into a baby (Season 2, Episode 6)]]\nBixby took the role of young reporter Tim O'Hara in the 1963 CBS sitcom, ''[[My Favorite Martian]]'', in which he co-starred with [[Ray Walston]]. By 1966, though, high production costs forced the series to come to an end after 107 episodes. After the cancellation of ''Martian'', Bixby starred in four movies: ''[[Ride Beyond Vengeance]]'', ''[[Doctor, You've Got to Be Kidding!]]'', and two of [[Elvis Presley]]'s movies, ''[[Clambake (film)|Clambake]]'' and ''[[Speedway (1968 film)|Speedway]]''. He turned down the role as [[Marlo Thomas]]'s boyfriend in the successful ''[[That Girl]]'', though he later guest-starred in the show, and starred in two failed pilots.\n\n===''The Courtship of Eddie's Father''===\nIn 1969, Bixby starred in his second high-profile television role, as Tom Corbett in ''[[The Courtship of Eddie's Father]]'', a [[comedy-drama]] on ABC. The series concerned a widowed father raising a young son, managing a major syndicated magazine, and at the same time trying to re-enter the dating scene. This series was in the vein of other 1960s and 1970s sitcoms that dealt with [[widower]]hood, such as ''[[The Andy Griffith Show]]'' and ''[[My Three Sons]]''. Eddie was played by novice actor [[Brandon Cruz]]. The pair developed a close rapport that translated to an off-camera friendship as well. The core cast was rounded out by [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]]-winning actress [[Miyoshi Umeki]], who played the role of Tom's housekeeper, Mrs. Livingston; [[James Komack]] (one of the series' producers) as Norman Tinker, Tom's pseudo-hippie, quirky photographer, and actress Kristina Holland as Tom's secretary, Tina. One episode of the series co-starred Bixby's future wife, [[Brenda Benet]], as one of Tom's girlfriends.\n\n[[File:Courtship of Eddies Father 1969.JPG|thumb|left|upright|With ''The Courtship of Eddie's Father'' co-stars, [[Brandon Cruz]] and [[Miyoshi Umeki]]]]\nBixby was nominated for the [[Emmy Award]] for Lead Actor in a Comedy Series in 1971. The following year, he won the Parents Without Partners Exemplary Service Award for 1972.\n\nBixby made his directorial debut on the sitcom in 1970, directing eight episodes. ABC canceled the sitcom in 1972 at the end of season three.\n\nAfter the show was canceled, Bixby and Cruz remained in contact, with Cruz making a guest appearance on Bixby's later series ''[[The Incredible Hulk (1978 TV series)|The Incredible Hulk]]''. The death of Bixby's only child, in 1981, drew Bixby and Cruz closer still. The two remained in touch until Bixby's death in 1993. In 1995, Cruz named his own son Lincoln Bixby Cruz.\n\nBrandon Cruz said of the show which developed a professional father-son relationship, compared to that of ''The Andy Griffith Show'', \"We dealt with issues that were talked about but were never brought up on television. Bill wasn't the first actor to portray a single widowed father, but he became one of the popular ones, because of his easy-going way of this crazy little kid.\" Prior to Bixby's promotion to director, Brandon said, \"He was looking for the best dolly grip, along with the boom operator that if something was called specifically and failed, Bill could be easily angry.\" On the kind of relationship Bill had wanted with his co-star, Brandon also said, \"Bill would never speak down to me. Bill treated me as an equal. He made sure that we had a lot of time together, just so he could kinda crawl inside my head and see what actually made a kid tick.\" Upon Bill's real-life father's death in 1971, Cruz stated: \"He had that type of mentality that the show must go on, thinking it was just a great T.V. show, after he broke down weeping.\"<ref>{{cite web | author= | title=Bill Bixby biography| url=http://www.biography.com/people/bill-bixby-9542610 | work=A+E Networks Digital| date= | accessdate=January 27, 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn a 2011 interview with Marilyn Beck and Stacy Jenel Smith about how Bill Bixby's fame was supposed to posthumously honor him for a Star on The Hollywood Walk of Fame, Cruz said, \"When I found out they were putting this out, I thought, 'It's about time.' Bill Bixby had an amazing body of work, not only ''Courtship of Eddie's Father,'' but ''My Favorite Martian,'' ''The Magician,'' ''The Incredible Hulk'' and so many other things, as an actor, as a director \u2014 and he never got an Emmy. He's never been recognized posthumously by the Academy. And he doesn't have a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. That is criminal.... There are people who have stars that, not to be blunt, but I wouldn't bother spitting on their stars. Bill's talent would take a couple of blocks of stars compared to them. It really demeans the whole thing that Bill is not included.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://becksmithhollywood.com/2011/10/brandon-cruz-angry-over-hollywood-forgetting-bill-bixby/comment-page-1|title=Brandon Cruz Angry Over Hollywood Forgetting Bill Bixby|publisher=BeckSmithHollywood.com|date=October 18, 2011 |accessdate=March 7, 2018}}</ref>\n\n===1973 to 1977===\nIn 1973, Bixby starred in ''[[The Magician (American TV series)|The Magician]]''. The series was well liked but lasted only one season. An accomplished amateur magician himself, he hosted several TV specials in the mid-1970s which featured other amateur magicians, and was a respected member of the Hollywood magic community, belonging to [[The Magic Castle]], an exclusive club for magicians. During the show's popular, although short-lived, production, Bixby invited a few old friends along to co-star such as [[Pamela Britton]] (in her final role), [[Kristina Holland]] and Ralph O'Hara.\n\nAlso in 1973, he starred in ''[[Steambath (play)|Steambath]]'', a play by author [[Bruce Jay Friedman]], on [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] with [[Valerie Perrine]] and Jose Perez.\n\nBixby became a popular game-show panelist, appearing mostly on ''[[Password (game show)|Password]]'' and ''[[The Hollywood Squares]]''. He was also a panelist on the 1974 revival of ''[[Masquerade Party]]'' hosted by [[Richard Dawson]]. He had also appeared with Dawson on ''Cop-Out''. In 1974-1975, he directed four episodes of the eighth season of ''[[Mannix]]'', guest-starring as Mannix's friend-turned-villain in one of the episodes.\n\nIn 1975, he co-starred with [[Tim Conway]] and [[Don Knotts]] in the Disney movie ''[[The Apple Dumpling Gang (film)|The Apple Dumpling Gang]]'', which was well received by the public.\n\nReturning to television, Bixby worked with [[Susan Blakely]] on ''[[Rich Man, Poor Man (miniseries)|Rich Man, Poor Man]]'', a highly successful television miniseries in 1976. He played a daredevil stunt pilot in an episode of the short-lived 1976 [[CBS]] adventure series ''[[Spencer's Pilots]]'', starring [[Gene Evans]]. In 1977, he co-starred in the pilot for the television series ''[[Fantasy Island]]''; starred in \"No Way Out\", the final episode of the NBC anthology series ''[[Quinn Martin's Tales of the Unexpected]]'' (known in the [[United Kingdom]] as ''Twist in the Tale'');<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ctva.biz/US/Anthology/TalesOfTheUnexpected.htm|title=CTVA US Anthology - \"Tales of the Unexpected\" (Quinn Martin/NBC)(1977)|website=ctva.biz|access-date=August 17, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140819083515/http://ctva.biz/US/Anthology/TalesOfTheUnexpected.htm|archive-date=August 19, 2014|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> and appeared with [[Donna Mills]], [[Richard Jaeckel]], and [[William Shatner]] in the last episode, \"The Scarlet Ribbon\", of NBC's Western series ''[[The Oregon Trail (TV series)|The Oregon Trail]]'', starring [[Rod Taylor]] and [[Andrew Stevens]]. Bixby directed two episodes of ''The Oregon Trail''.\n\nIn 1976, he was honored with two [[Emmy Award]] nominations, one for Outstanding Lead Actor for a Single Appearance in Drama or Comedy for ''The Streets of San Francisco'' and the other for Outstanding Single Performance by a Supporting Actor in Comedy or Drama Series for ''Rich Man, Poor Man''.\n\nBixby hosted ''[[Once Upon a Classic]]'' on [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] from 1976 to 1980.\n\n===''The Incredible Hulk''===\nBixby starred in the role of Dr. David Banner in the pilot movie, ''The Incredible Hulk'', based on the [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]] [[Marvel Comics|Marvel]] characters.

The pilot also starred [[Susan Sullivan]] as Dr. Elaina Marks, who tries to help the conflicted and widowed Dr. Banner overcome his \"problem\", and falls in love with him in the process. In a retrospective on ''The Incredible Hulk'', [[Glenn Greenberg]] declared Bixby's performance to be the series's \"foremost\" strength, elaborating that he \"masterfully conveyed the profound loneliness and tragedy of Dr. Banner while also bringing to the role an abundance of warmth, intelligence, humor, nobility, likability, and above all else, humanity.\"<ref name=\"Back70\">{{cite journal| last=Glenn| first=Greenberg| authorlink=Glenn Greenberg| date=February 2014| title=The Televised Hulk| journal=[[Back Issue!]]| issue=70| pages=19\u201326| publisher=[[TwoMorrows Publishing]]}}</ref>\n\nDuring the series' run, Bixby invited two of his longtime friends, [[Ray Walston]] and [[Brandon Cruz]], to guest-star with him in different episodes of the series. He also worked on the series with his friend, movie actress [[Mariette Hartley]], who later starred with Bixby in his final series, ''[[Goodnight, Beantown]]'' in 1983. Hartley appears in the well-regarded double-length episode \"Married\",<ref name=\"Back70\"/> and subsequently won an Emmy Award for her guest appearance. Future star [[Loni Anderson]] also guest starred with Bixby during the first season. Bixby directed one episode of the series, \"Bring Me the Head of the Hulk\" in 1980 (original airdate: January 9, 1981). The series was canceled after the following season, but leftover episodes aired as late as the next June. Bixby later executive-produced and reprised the role in three television movies \u2013 ''[[The Incredible Hulk Returns]]'', ''[[The Trial of the Incredible Hulk]]'', and ''[[The Death of the Incredible Hulk]]'' \u2013 the last two of which he also directed, and the first of which he has been said to have unofficially co-directed.<ref name=\"Back70\"/>\n\n===Later work===\nBixby was executive producer and co-star of the short-lived sitcom ''[[Goodnight, Beantown]]'' (1983\u201384).

From 1983 to 1984, he hosted a documentary series for [[Nickelodeon]] entitled ''[[Against the Odds (TV series)|Against the Odds]]''.
