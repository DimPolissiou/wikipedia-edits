{"title_page": "List of Mamluk sultans", "text_new": "{{short description|Wikipedia list article}}\n[[File:Citadel of Salah el deen al ayoubi 03.JPG|thumb|right|The [[Cairo Citadel]], the seat of power of the Mamluk sultans]]\nThe following is a '''list of Mamluk sultans'''. The [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluk Sultanate]] was founded in 1250 by ''[[mamluk]]s'' of the [[Ayyubid dynasty|Ayyubid]] sultan [[as-Salih Ayyub]] and it succeeded the Ayyubid state. It was based in [[Cairo]] and for much of its history, the territory of the sultanate spanned Egypt, [[Syria (region)|Syria]] and parts of [[Anatolia]], [[Upper Mesopotamia]] and the [[Hejaz]]. The sultanate ended with the advent of the [[Ottoman Empire]] in 1517.\n\nThere were a total of 47 sultans, although Sultan [[an-Nasir Muhammad]] reigned three times, and sultans [[an-Nasir Hasan]], Salah ad-Din Hajji, [[Barquq]] and [[an-Nasir Faraj]] each reigned twice. The Mamluk period is generally divided into two periods, the [[Bahri dynasty|Bahri]] and [[Burji dynasty|Burji]] periods. The Bahri sultans were predominantly of [[Turkic people|Turkic]] origins, while the Burji sultans were predominantly ethnic [[Circassians]]. While the first three Mamluk sultans, [[Aybak]], his son [[al-Mansur Ali]], and [[Qutuz]], are generally considered part of the Bahri dynasty, they were not part of the Bahriyya ''mamluk'' regiment and opposed the political interests of the Bahriyya.<ref name=\"Northrup6970\">Northrup 1998, pp. 69\u201370.</ref> The first sultan to come from the Bahriyya's ranks was [[Baibars|Baybars]].<ref name=\"Northrup6970\"/> The Burji ''mamluks'' usurped the throne in 1382 with the accession of Sultan Barquq. The 34th sultan, [[Al-Musta'in (Cairo)|al-Musta'in Billah]], was also the [[Caliph of Cairo]] and was installed in power by the Burji emirs as a figurehead.<ref name=\"Britannica101-103\"/>\n\n==List of sultans==\n{{clear}}\n{| class=\"nowraplinks\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"3\" rules=\"all\" style=\"background:#fbfbfb; border-style: solid; border-width: 1px; font-size:90%; empty-cells:show; border-collapse:collapse\"\n|-\n!colspan=\"11\" |\n{{legend2|#e5e5e5|Salihi Mamluks|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}}\n{{legend2|#b2dfdf|[[Bahri dynasty]]|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}}\n{{legend2|#fffab4|[[Burji dynasty]]|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}}\n|-\n|- style=\"background:#f6e6ae;\"\n!

The [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluk Sultanate]] was founded in 1250 by ''[[mamluk]]s'' of the [[Ayyubid dynasty|Ayyubid]] sultan [[as-Salih Ayyub]] and it succeeded the Ayyubid state. It was based in [[Cairo]] and for much of its history, the territory of the sultanate spanned Egypt, [[Syria (region)|Syria]] and parts of [[Anatolia]], [[Upper Mesopotamia]] and the [[Hejaz]]. The sultanate ended with the advent of the [[Ottoman Empire]] in 1517.\n\nThere were a total of 47 sultans, although Sultan [[an-Nasir Muhammad]] reigned three times, and sultans [[an-Nasir Hasan]], Salah ad-Din Hajji, [[Barquq]] and [[an-Nasir Faraj]] each reigned twice. The Mamluk period is generally divided into two periods, the [[Bahri dynasty|Bahri]] and [[Burji dynasty|Burji]] periods. The Bahri sultans were predominantly of [[Turkic people|Turkic]] origins, while the Burji sultans were predominantly ethnic [[Circassians]]. While the first three Mamluk sultans, [[Aybak]], his son [[al-Mansur Ali]], and [[Qutuz]], are generally considered part of the Bahri dynasty, they were not part of the Bahriyya ''mamluk'' regiment and opposed the political interests of the Bahriyya.<ref name=\"Northrup6970\">Northrup 1998, pp. 69\u201370.</ref> The first sultan to come from the Bahriyya's ranks was [[Baibars|Baybars]].<ref name=\"Northrup6970\"/> The Burji ''mamluks'' usurped the throne in 1382 with the accession of Sultan Barquq. The 34th sultan, [[Al-Musta'in (Cairo)|al-Musta'in Billah]], was also the [[Abbasid caliph]] and was installed in power by the Burji emirs as a figurehead.<ref name=\"Britannica101-103\"/>\n\n==List of sultans==\n{{clear}}\n{| class=\"nowraplinks\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"3\" rules=\"all\" style=\"background:#fbfbfb; border-style: solid; border-width: 1px; font-size:90%; empty-cells:show; border-collapse:collapse\"\n|-\n!colspan=\"11\" |\n{{legend2|#e5e5e5|Salihi Mamluks|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}}\n{{legend2|#b2dfdf|[[Bahri dynasty]]|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}}\n{{legend2|#fffab4|[[Burji dynasty]]|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}}\n|-\n|- style=\"background:#f6e6ae;\"\n!

It is the fourth book in the main ''[[Wayside School (book series)|Wayside School]]'' series, and the sixth book overall.\n\nThe book is set in the titular Wayside School, an elementary school that was accidentally built sideways, being thirty stories tall with one classroom on each floor, but without a nineteenth story. The book focuses on the school as the Cloud of Doom, a large gloomy storm cloud, settles above the school, inciting bouts of anxiety and depression in the students.

The Bells of Wayside: This chapter introduces Wayside School's elaborate bell system, while Todd tries to rush to class in the morning. He shows up late, and the day goes poorly for him, as his name is written on the discipline list, Mrs. Jewls assigns numerous homework assignments, and a warning is written on the blackboard about the upcoming Ultimate Test. At the end of the chapter, the Erase-the-Blackboard Bell rings, forcing Mrs. Jewls to erase the blackboard, cancelling the homework assignments, delaying the Ultimate Test, and removing Todd's name from the discipline list.\n\n; 2. A Million: Mrs. Jewls is teaching the class a lesson on how large a [[1,000,000|million]] is, and decides the best way to show it is by collecting a million of something. Terrence, who had been kicking things for the entire morning, is not paying attention due to his big toe hurting, and decides to relieve his pain by clipping his toenail. Mrs. Jewls, seeing this, decides that the class will collect a million nail clippings.\n\n; 3. Up and Down: D.J. has a bad case of the hiccups, which Kathy is arguing with. Mrs. Jewls has D.J. see Dr. Pickell to cure his hiccups, and has Kathy come with him. Dr. Pickell takes note of Kathy's argumentative behavior as he takes D.J. into his office to scare the hiccups out of him. When finished, Dr. Pickell decides to take Kathy into his office as well, while D.J. waits in the hallway. When she returns, she is acting much nicer, something that catches D.J. off-guard.\n\n; 4. Consider the Paper Clip: Dana, having finished her book report, needs a [[paper clip]] to hold it together, but is unable to find one. She asks Mrs. Jewls for a new one, and Mrs. Jewls is very upset, having given Dana a paper clip at the start of the year that she was supposed to hold on to. After it turns out numerous other students have lost their paper clips as well, Mrs. Jewls is ashamed, and explains to the class the laborious process by which paper clips are made. She hands Dana a new paper clip, and Dana promises not to lose it.\n\n; 5. Eric, Eric, and ''What's-His-Name?'': Of the three Erics in Mrs. Jewls's class, Eric Ovens is shown to be the one that gets the least attention from his classmates. Eric Ovens hopes to remedy this by bringing in more nail clippings than any other student, but is disheartened when he is overshadowed by Eric Bacon bringing in 349. Kathy, however, encourages Eric Ovens to still show his collection to Mrs. Jewls, and cheers him on due to bringing the second-most ever, something the rest of the class joins in on.\n\n; 6. Oppositosis: A flashback to \"Up and Down,\" where Kathy is seen in Dr. Pickell's office. Dr. Pickell has Kathy say the first word that comes to her mind based on the words he says, and diagnoses her with oppositosis, a condition that makes her say the opposite of whatever she intends to. He hypnotizes her, and has her imagine stepping through a mirror, and imagine what is on the other side. He then has her wake up, still on the other side of the mirror. Back in Mrs. Jewls's class, Mrs. Jewls notices that while Kathy has been acting nicer lately, all of her work is being written backwards.\n\n; 7. The Closet That Wasn't There: When Mac returns to class from lunch, he notices a large, heavily-locked cabinet outside of Mrs. Jewls's class. The other students also start to notice the closet, and start questioning what is inside. They attempt opening  it, but Mrs. Jewls shows up, frantically warning all the students to stay away from her closet, telling them to treat it as if it is not there. Mac, however, is left more curious than ever.\n\n; 8. Science: The students of Mrs. Jewls's class go onto the school's roof to study the various clouds in the sky. Bebe draws pictures of the clouds in her notebook, imagining them as other things. Benjamin notices a dark cloud off in the distance, and asks what it is, but Mrs. Jewls has all the students run back inside as fast as they can. The chapter ends with Mrs. Jewls explaining that it is a Cloud of Doom.\n\n; 9. The Gonnnnng: Louis is working on the playground, when the Cloud of Doom casts its shadow over the school. Louis ends up over-inflating a ball, causing it to explode, and begins to collect the scattered pieces, but remembers he has to prepare the gong that Mr. Kidswatter rings at the end of the day. After Kidswatter rings the gong, he notices the kids complimenting Louis, but not himself, and asks Louis why. Louis tells Mr. Kidswatter that he should do something nice for the students, like letting one of them ring the gong instead. Mr. Kidswatter is initially hesitant, but considers it after hearing that Louis may write a nice chapter about him later in the book.\n\n; 10. Stuck: Dana is shown to be skilled at making funny faces, but Mrs. Jewls warns her that her face could get stuck. Dana does not worry, since her face usually bounces back, but after making a funny face when John teases her, it actually does get stuck. The students ask Louis for help, and he just blows his whistle, which attracts the attention of other students, as well as Mr. Kidswatter. Mr. Kidswatter gets into a staring contest with Dana, and eventually walks away. Dana's face gets unstuck, but now Mr. Kidswatter's face is stuck in the same expression.\n\n; 11. What's the Point?: Mrs. Jewls is having students suggest words for her weekly spelling lesson, when Myron asks her what the point of spelling is when the Cloud of Doom is hanging above them. The other students agree with his pessimistic outlook, but Mrs. Jewls asks what the point of quitting is, and gives an inspirational speech, explaining that the world will be a happier place when the Cloud of Doom is gone. She continues with her lesson, with Jenny suggesting the word \"hope.\"\n\n; 12. Mrs. Surlaw: This chapter introduces Mrs. Surlaw, the school librarian, who organizes all the books in the library by their number of pages, and not any other factor. Allison is picking out a long novel to read, and Jason picks one that is one page longer. Allison repeatedly picks longer novels than Jason, and Jason always tries to pick one that is longer, but eventually Allison dashes around a corner, and checks out a book that Jason is not aware of. Jason wants to pick one longer than Allison still, but worries constantly that she picked a book longer than whatever he considers. He ends up picking the last book in the library, which is 999 pages long.\n\n; 13. Umbrella: Sharie is stomping in puddles in the rain, carrying her favorite umbrella, when she hears the school's morning bell ring. She starts rushing for the school, hoping not to be late, but briefly pauses when she looks up and notices that the Cloud of Doom has been keeping all the other clouds away, including the rain clouds. Suddenly, a gust of wind tears her umbrella away, and she reaches for it, getting carried alongside it. She starts wondering when to let go, realizing that she will be sucked into the Cloud of Doom if she does not. She ends up leaping through a window into her class, and makes it to class just on time, at the sacrifice of her favorite umbrella.\n\n; 14. Mr. K and Dr. P: This chapter is about Mr. Kidswatter and Dr. Pickell, though both their names are obscured for the purpose of confidentiality. Mr. Kidswatter walks into Dr. Pickell's office to get help with his stuck face, while Dr. Pickell looks for a solution. Dr. Pickell settles on hypnotizing him, having him imagine his grandmother baking a pie, and having him imagine the smell and taste. However, before he can take a bite, the pie is smashed in his face, surprising him so much that his expression becomes undone. Mr. Kidswatter thanks Dr. Pickell for the help, and Dr. Pickell is happy to have helped someone so important, except that he now has the face himself.\n\n; 15. The Unbreakables: This chapter introduces the Unbreakables, a four-way friend group consisting of Deedee, Ron, Maurecia, and Joy. The Cloud of Doom is shown to put pressure on friendships, including the Unbreakables, where other three start to tease Deedee over her enjoyment of Miss Mush's spaghetti and feetballs, which leads to her messing up her homework and having to start over. Deedee finishes her homework while the other three enjoy recess, and dumps her tray in the trash after she finishes. Deedee, however, realizes that her homework was on the tray, and has to search through the dumpsters to find it. The other three end up joining her, and the chapter notes that while even the Cloud of Doom could not break their friendship, the ultimate test of friendship is still to come.\n\n; 16. A Short Chapter About a Long Book: Jason is regretting picking the longest book in the library, as Mrs. Jewls repeatedly asks him if his book report is ready. Jason is shown to be stalling reading the book, but as he reads further, slowly gets invested in it. Eventually he starts reading so much, that he cannot stop. Allison and Rondi try to tease him, but he asks them to quiet down, as he is trying to read.\n\n; 17. The Best Principal Ever!!!: Mrs. Jewls is handing out homework assignments, when Mr. Kidswatter barges into the class, asking for someone to ring the gong on Friday. All the students want to be chosen, but he ends up selecting Stephen, a choice that confuses everyone, including himself. However, he moves forwards with it, telling Stephen to show up at the bottom of the stairs on Friday. The other students tell Stephen how lucky he is, but he can not hear them, only hearing the gong.\n\n; 18. The Mirror: Dr. Pickell is looking at his face in the mirror, trying to figure out how to get it unstuck. He tries putting himself to sleep, but it does not work, as he cannot tell himself what to do. He wakes up much later, noticing his face in the mirror is still stuck, but he begins to notice his own face is not, and that he transferred the face to his reflection. He realizes his discovery, and briefly considers sharing it to become famous, but worries about the face getting transferred to someone else, and shatters the mirror instead. This affects Kathy, who notices her handwriting is backwards. D.J. says that it is cool, but Kathy says it is warm.\n\n; 19. Push-Downs: Stephen is on the playground doing push-downs, preparing to ring the gong. Kathy remarks that they should be called push-ups, not because she is trying to be opposite, as she discovered she likes having friends, but because she is pretty sure that is what they are called. Stephen asks if someone else can do it, but Louis assures Mr. Kidswatter must have picked him for a good reason. There is a flashback to \"The Best Principal Ever!!!,\" where it is revealed Kidswatter meant to pick Joy, but ended up noticing Dana instead. He prepared to point accusingly at her, but she bended down to scratch a mosquito bite, and Stephen sits behind her. Back on the playground, Louis explains that if Stephen does not do it, then he will be disappointed whenever he hears a gong again. Stephen gives it one last shot, raising himself an inch above the ground.\n\n; 20. Inside the Closet: Stephen finishes his book, and turns in a ten page long book report to Mrs. Jewls. Mrs. Jewls asks where the paper clip is, and he reveals that he bent it in the process, into a thin, crooked line. Mrs. Jewls takes him to the closet, and starts the elaborate process of unlocking it. When she opens it, the closet appears to be empty, and Jason worries he will be locked inside, but Mrs. Jewls has him look closer. There is a small box of paper clips in the closet, and Mrs. Jewls hands one to Jason, having him promise to never tell anyone else where he got it.\n\n; 21. Breathe: Stephen is still worried about ringing the gong, but his classmates try to calm him down, asking him to breathe. He continuously thinks of the various things that could go wrong, but his classmates continue to calm him down. Mrs. Jewls prepares for music class, but the instruments are being cleaned, so they must simply make music by whatever means they can. Time passes quickly, and suddenly Stephen realizes he may be late to ring the gong. The class has him breathe one more time as he leaves the room.\n\n; 22. The Moment: Stephen heads down the stairs, still worrying about what could go wrong, when he notices Jenny's skateboard between two stairs. He steps over it, and realizing how easy it was, all his fears fade away. He runs down to the first floor, where it turns out he is right on time, and is handed the heavy iron mallet to ring the gong. He swings, and misses, but brings himself around in a circle, hitting it on the second go. On the thirtieth story, the children cheer, and the chapter ends by noting that whenever Stephen is upset, he thinks about that moment, and smiles.\n\n; 23. Blame It on the Cloud: Mrs. Jewls notices that many students in her class have been misbehaving, but they all claim that the Cloud of Doom is making them do it. While initially forgiving, she becomes increasingly frustrated as more students continue to use the cloud as a scapegoat, and eventually has enough. She makes all the students write their name under the discipline list, except for Todd, who she says has been behaving, and she decides that the Ultimate Test will start tomorrow. The other students ask why Mrs. Jewls is being so mean, and she blames it on the Cloud of Doom.\n\n; 24. The Ultimate Test, Day One: As the first major event in the Ultimate Test, Mrs. Jewls holds a spelling bee in her room. The competition narrows down to Ron and Maurecia, who end up narrowing down all the words in the dictionary, forcing Mrs. Jewls to resort to non-dictionary words. Ron eventually messes up the spelling of \"whummph,\" causing Maurecia to win, though he thinks it is unfair, as he cannot know how a made-up word is spelled. While Maurecia celebrates, Ron is not smiling.\n\n; 25. Jump Rope Arithmetic: The major event of the second day of the Ultimate Test is Jump Rope Arithmetic, which involves solving math problems while jumping rope. Joy turns out to be an expert at this, quickly accumulating points to set a new school record, something that makes her feel very proud. She starts daydreaming of the success she will have from her record, but notices Maurecia is still jumping. Joy waits for Maurecia to slip up, but Maurecia keeps going, eventually getting a score over twice as large as Joy's. However, Joy does not see her fall, having stopped watching long beforehand.\n\n; 26. The Ultimate, Ultimate Test: The final major event of the Ultimate Test is the Stairway Quiz, where students must run up the stairs of Wayside while solving trivia problems. If they miss a problem, they will be sent back to the previous checkpoint, which shows up every five floors. Deedee excels at this, answering most problems right, and quickly rushing up the stairs, but she gets stuck briefly trying to recite the alphabet backwards on the school's missing nineteenth story, giving Maurecia time to catch up with her. The two rush up the stairs together, while Deedee starts to get ahead, but she ends up missing the final problem, letting Maurecia get the victory. At the end of the day, Joy, Ron, and Deedee meet by the flagpole, with Maurecia showing up much later due to being interviewed for her excellent performance on the Ultimate Test. The Unbreakables eventually reconcile, and the chapter notes that while helping a friend that is down is a true test of friendship, staying by a friend that is up is the ultimate test of friendship.\n\n; 27. Kachooga Boop: It is revealed that no one failed the Ultimate Test, as Mrs. Jewls designed it so each student's talent would shine. Myron begins to bring in his nail clippings for the day, bringing the total to 999,999, but is interrupted by a loud bell he has never heard before. Mrs. Jewls searches to find out what that bell means, and it turns out to be a request for immediate evacuation, as the Cloud of Doom is about to destroy everything. The students hurry out of the room, and down the stairs holding hands so they will not get lost in the darkness, but Joe slips on a skateboard, bringing everyone else down with him. The students worry about what they should do, but they notice one classroom is still open.\n\n; 28. The Teacher With the Long Fingernail: The students rush into the one active classroom, which turns out to be Miss Zarves's class on the school's missing nineteenth story, allowing Calvin to finally turn in the note he was supposed to deliver in ''[[Sideways Stories from Wayside School]]''. The class is doing their history lesson, where they are supposed to study every person who has ever lived, something that stumps all the students in Mrs. Jewls's class. Myron is handed a Chinese dictionary so he can study the people that were born in China, when he gets the idea to trim Miss Zarves's fingernail, which has grown excessively large. After clipping it, the students find themselves scattered on the staircase, with Myron holding up the millionth nail clipping.\n\n; 29. After the Storm: The students return to class after the storm, which has shuffled everything inside the school to a random other floor. In Mrs. Jewls's class, Myron places the millionth nail clipping in the bucket, though the rest are gone. As the teachers stay inside to clean the mess, the students are sent outside, where it is shown that the Cloud of Doom dropped a lot of snow over the school. The kids play a game, while they try to crash into the clumps of snow Louis is tossing off the roof, but he eventually notices Sharie's umbrella caught in the snow. He yanks it out, but ends up sliding backwards off the roof, holding the wrong end of the umbrella to use it as a parachute. He tries to grab the flagpole and misses, but the hooked end of the umbrella latches on, spinning him around in circles as he slides down. Sharie grabs back her umbrella, thanking Louis, but informing he should have used the stairs.\n\n; 30. Rainbow: Miss Mush is preparing to make the best meal ever after the Cloud of Doom is gone, and eventually settles on making rainbow stew. She gets help from her assistant, Mr. Pepperadder, to collect various colorful ingredients to use, but by the time she is serving it, she notices that it is now a grayish-brown mush. She apologizes to the students as she serves it, and the students are initially hesitant, but as they eat it, they taste the colors, and declare it the best lunch ever. Mr. Pepperadder asks what the recipe is, but Miss Mush explains there is no recipe, as no two rainbows are the same.\n\n==Reception==\n''Wayside School Beneath the Cloud of Doom'' has been met with largely positive reception from critics. Carrie Kingsley of [[Common Sense Media]] gave the book 5 out of 5 stars, claiming that \"Beneath the teachers' comically odd takes on math, spelling bees, and P.E., there's a feeling of warmth among the students as they learn to be more forgiving and to stick together. The oddball interactions between the faculty and students always comes from a place of kindness: The terrifying Ultimate Test gives every student a chance to shine, and even the dreaded lunch lady gets it right sometimes.\"<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.commonsensemedia.org/book-reviews/wayside-school-beneath-the-cloud-of-doom-wayside-school-book-4 | title=Wayside School Beneath the Cloud of Doom: Wayside School, Book 4 Book Review| date=2020 | author=Kingsley, Carrie | publisher=[[Common Sense Media]]}}</ref> ''[[Kirkus Reviews]]'' additionally published a positive review of the book, stating that even after a 25-year gap from the previous book in the series, the new entry retains an entertaining sense of humor.<ref>{{cite web |title=WAYSIDE SCHOOL BENEATH THE CLOUD OF DOOM |url=https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/louis-sachar/wayside-school-beneath-the-cloud-of-doom/ |accessdate=10 April 2020 |work=Kirkus Reviews |publisher=Kirkus Reviews |date=29 September 2019}}</ref> A review from ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' assesses the book positively as well, stating that \"Sachar\u2019s snappy comedic stride doesn\u2019t miss a beat in his series\u2019 fourth installment\u2014the first since 1995's ''Wayside School Gets a Little Stranger''\u2014as the curiosities of Mrs. Jewls's 30th-floor classroom multiply more quickly than ever.\"<ref>{{cite web |title=Children's Book Review: Wayside School Beneath the Cloud of Doom |url=https://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-06-296538-7 |publisher=Publishers Weekly |accessdate=10 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n[[Category:Novels by Louis Sachar]]\n[[Category:2020 American novels]]\n[[Category:Wayside School]]\n[[Category:American children's novels]]\n[[Category:American comedy novels]]\n[[Category:Novels set in schools]]\n[[Category:2020 children's books]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox book\n| name = Wayside School Beneath the Cloud of Doom\n| title_orig = \n| translator = \n| image = \n| caption = First edition\n| author = [[Louis Sachar]]\n| illustrator = Tim Heitz\n| cover_artist = \n| country = United States\n| language = English\n| series = ''[[Wayside School (book series)|Wayside School]]''\n| subject = \n| genre = [[Children's literature]]\n| publisher = [[HarperCollins]]\n| release_date = March 3, 2020<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.harpercollins.com/9780062965387/wayside-school-beneath-the-cloud-of-doom/ |title=Wayside School Beneath the Cloud of Doom - Louis Sachar - Hardcover |publisher=HarperCollins |date= |accessdate=2020-04-10}}</ref>\n| media_type = Print (in [[Hardcover]])\n| pages = 192\n| isbn = 978-0-06-296538-7\n| congress = \n| oclc = \n| preceded_by = [[Wayside School Gets A Little Stranger]] (1995)\n| followed_by = \n}}\n{{Portal |United States|Children's literature|Books}}\n\n'''''Wayside School Beneath the Cloud of Doom''''' is a 2020 [[children's novel|children's]] [[short story cycle]] novel by American author [[Louis Sachar]].

Dr. Pickell has Kathy say the first word that comes to her mind based on the words he says, and diagnoses her with oppositosis, a condition that makes her say the opposite of whatever she intends to. He hypnotizes her, and has her imagine stepping through a mirror, and imagine what is on the other side. He then has her wake up, still on the other side of the mirror. Back in Mrs. Jewls's class, Mrs. Jewls notices that while Kathy has been acting nicer lately, all of her work is being written backwards.\n\n; 7. The Closet That Wasn't There: When Mac returns to class from lunch, he notices a large, heavily-locked cabinet outside of Mrs. Jewls's class. The other students also start to notice the closet, and start questioning what is inside. They attempt opening  it, but Mrs. Jewls shows up, frantically warning all the students to stay away from her closet, telling them to treat it as if it is not there. Mac, however, is left more curious than ever.\n\n; 8. Science: The students of Mrs. Jewls's class go onto the school's roof to study the various clouds in the sky. Bebe draws pictures of the clouds in her notebook, imagining them as other things. Benjamin notices a dark cloud off in the distance, and asks what it is, but Mrs. Jewls has all the students run back inside as fast as they can. The chapter ends with Mrs. Jewls explaining that it is a Cloud of Doom.\n\n; 9. The Gonnnnng: Louis is working on the playground, when the Cloud of Doom casts its shadow over the school. Louis ends up over-inflating a ball, causing it to explode, and begins to collect the scattered pieces, but remembers he has to prepare the gong that Mr. Kidswatter rings at the end of the day. After Kidswatter rings the gong, he notices the kids complimenting Louis, but not himself, and asks Louis why. Louis tells Mr. Kidswatter that he should do something nice for the students, like letting one of them ring the gong instead. Mr. Kidswatter is initially hesitant, but considers it after hearing that Louis may write a nice chapter about him later in the book.\n\n; 10. Stuck: Dana is shown to be skilled at making funny faces, but Mrs. Jewls warns her that her face could get stuck. Dana does not worry, since her face usually bounces back, but after making a funny face when teasing John, it actually does get stuck. The students ask Louis for help, and he just blows his whistle, which attracts the attention of other students, as well as Mr. Kidswatter. Mr. Kidswatter gets into a staring contest with Dana, and eventually walks away. Dana's face gets unstuck, but now Mr. Kidswatter's face is stuck in the same expression.\n\n; 11. What's the Point?: Mrs. Jewls is having students suggest words for her weekly spelling lesson, when Myron asks her what the point of spelling is when the Cloud of Doom is hanging above them. The other students agree with his pessimistic outlook, but Mrs. Jewls asks what the point of quitting is, and gives an inspirational speech, explaining that the world will be a happier place when the Cloud of Doom is gone. She continues with her lesson, with Jenny suggesting the word \"hope.\"\n\n; 12. Mrs. Surlaw: This chapter introduces Mrs. Surlaw, the school librarian, who organizes all the books in the library by their number of pages, and not any other factor. Allison is picking out a long novel to read, and Jason picks one that is one page longer. Allison repeatedly picks longer novels than Jason, and Jason always tries to pick one that is longer, but eventually Allison dashes around a corner, and checks out a book that Jason is not aware of. Jason wants to pick one longer than Allison still, but worries constantly that she picked a book longer than whatever he considers. He ends up picking the last book in the library, which is 999 pages long.\n\n; 13. Umbrella: Sharie is stomping in puddles in the rain, carrying her favorite umbrella, when she hears the school's morning bell ring. She starts rushing for the school, hoping not to be late, but briefly pauses when she looks up and notices that the Cloud of Doom has been keeping all the other clouds away, including the rain clouds. Suddenly, a gust of wind tears her umbrella away, and she reaches for it, getting carried alongside it. She starts wondering when to let go, realizing that she will be sucked into the Cloud of Doom if she does not. She ends up leaping through a window into her class, and makes it to class just on time, at the sacrifice of her favorite umbrella.\n\n; 14. Mr. K and Dr. P: This chapter is about Mr. Kidswatter and Dr. Pickell, though both their names are obscured for the purpose of confidentiality. Mr. Kidswatter walks into Dr. Pickell's office to get help with his stuck face, while Dr. Pickell looks for a solution. Dr. Pickell settles on hypnotizing him, having him imagine his grandmother baking a pie, and having him imagine the smell and taste. However, before he can take a bite, the pie is smashed in his face, surprising him so much that his expression becomes undone. Mr. Kidswatter thanks Dr. Pickell for the help, and Dr. Pickell is happy to have helped someone so important, except that he now has the face himself.\n\n; 15. The Unbreakables: This chapter introduces the Unbreakables, a four-way friend group consisting of Deedee, Ron, Maurecia, and Joy. The Cloud of Doom is shown to put pressure on friendships, including the Unbreakables, where other three start to tease Deedee over her enjoyment of Miss Mush's spaghetti and feetballs, which leads to her messing up her homework and having to start over. Deedee finishes her homework while the other three enjoy recess, and dumps her tray in the trash after she finishes. Deedee, however, realizes that her homework was on the tray, and has to search through the dumpsters to find it. The other three end up joining her, and the chapter notes that while even the Cloud of Doom could not break their friendship, the ultimate test of friendship is still to come.\n\n; 16. A Short Chapter About a Long Book: Jason is regretting picking the longest book in the library, as Mrs. Jewls repeatedly asks him if his book report is ready. Jason is shown to be stalling reading the book, but as he reads further, slowly gets invested in it. Eventually he starts reading so much, that he cannot stop. Allison and Rondi try to tease him, but he asks them to quiet down, as he is trying to read.\n\n; 17. The Best Principal Ever!!!: Mrs. Jewls is handing out homework assignments, when Mr. Kidswatter barges into the class, asking for someone to ring the gong on Friday. All the students want to be chosen, but he ends up selecting Stephen, a choice that confuses everyone, including himself. However, he moves forwards with it, telling Stephen to show up at the bottom of the stairs on Friday. The other students tell Stephen how lucky he is, but he can not hear them, only hearing the gong.\n\n; 18. The Mirror: Dr. Pickell is looking at his face in the mirror, trying to figure out how to get it unstuck. He tries putting himself to sleep, but it does not work, as he cannot tell himself what to do. He wakes up much later, noticing his face in the mirror is still stuck, but he begins to notice his own face is not, and that he transferred the face to his reflection. He realizes his discovery, and briefly considers sharing it to become famous, but worries about the face getting transferred to someone else, and shatters the mirror instead. This affects Kathy, who notices her handwriting is backwards. D.J. says that it is cool, but Kathy says it is warm.\n\n; 19. Push-Downs: Stephen is on the playground doing push-downs, preparing to ring the gong. Kathy remarks that they should be called push-ups, not because she is trying to be opposite, as she discovered she likes having friends, but because she is pretty sure that is what they are called. Stephen asks if someone else can do it, but Louis assures Mr. Kidswatter must have picked him for a good reason. There is a flashback to \"The Best Principal Ever!!!,\" where it is revealed Kidswatter meant to pick Joy, but ended up noticing Dana instead. He prepares to point accusingly at her, but she bends down to scratch a mosquito bite, and Stephen sits behind her. Back on the playground, Louis explains that if Stephen does not do it, then he will be disappointed whenever he hears a gong again. Stephen gives it one last shot, raising himself an inch above the ground.\n\n; 20. Inside the Closet: Stephen finishes his book, and turns in a ten page long book report to Mrs. Jewls. Mrs. Jewls asks where the paper clip is, and he reveals that he bent it in the process, into a thin, crooked line. Mrs. Jewls takes him to the closet, and starts the elaborate process of unlocking it. When she opens it, the closet appears to be empty, and Jason worries he will be locked inside, but Mrs. Jewls has him look closer. There is a small box of paper clips in the closet, and Mrs. Jewls hands one to Jason, having him promise to never tell anyone else where he got it.\n\n; 21. Breathe: Stephen is still worried about ringing the gong, but his classmates try to calm him down, asking him to breathe. He continuously thinks of the various things that could go wrong, but his classmates continue to calm him down. Mrs. Jewls prepares for music class, but the instruments are being cleaned, so they must simply make music by whatever means they can. Time passes quickly, and suddenly Stephen realizes he may be late to ring the gong. The class has him breathe one more time as he leaves the room.\n\n; 22. The Moment: Stephen heads down the stairs, still worrying about what could go wrong, when he notices Jenny's skateboard between two stairs. He steps over it, and realizing how easy it was, all his fears fade away. He runs down to the first floor, where it turns out he is right on time, and is handed the heavy iron mallet to ring the gong. He swings, and misses, but brings himself around in a circle, hitting it on the second go. On the thirtieth story, the children cheer, and the chapter ends by noting that whenever Stephen is upset, he thinks about that moment, and smiles.\n\n; 23. Blame It on the Cloud: Mrs. Jewls notices that many students in her class have been misbehaving, but they all claim that the Cloud of Doom is making them do it. While initially forgiving, she becomes increasingly frustrated as more students continue to use the cloud as a scapegoat, and eventually has enough. She makes all the students write their name under the discipline list, except for Todd, who she says has been behaving, and claims that the Ultimate Test will start tomorrow. The other students ask why Mrs. Jewls is being so mean, and she blames it on the Cloud of Doom.\n\n; 24. The Ultimate Test, Day One: As the first major event in the Ultimate Test, Mrs. Jewls holds a spelling bee in her room. The competition narrows down to Ron and Maurecia, who end up narrowing down all the words in the dictionary, forcing Mrs. Jewls to resort to non-dictionary words. Ron eventually messes up the spelling of \"whummph,\" causing Maurecia to win, though he thinks it is unfair, as he cannot know how a made-up word is spelled. While Maurecia celebrates, Ron is not smiling.\n\n; 25. Jump Rope Arithmetic: The major event of the second day of the Ultimate Test is Jump Rope Arithmetic, which involves solving math problems while jumping rope. Joy turns out to be an expert at this, quickly accumulating points to set a new school record, something that makes her feel very proud. She starts daydreaming of the success she will have from her record, but notices Maurecia is still jumping. Joy waits for Maurecia to slip up, but Maurecia keeps going, eventually getting a score over twice as large as Joy's. However, Joy does not see her fall, having stopped watching long beforehand.\n\n; 26. The Ultimate, Ultimate Test: The final major event of the Ultimate Test is the Stairway Quiz, where students must run up the stairs of Wayside while solving trivia problems. If they miss a problem, they will be sent back to the previous checkpoint, which shows up every five floors. Deedee excels at this, answering most problems right, and quickly rushing up the stairs, but she gets stuck briefly trying to recite the alphabet backwards on the school's missing nineteenth story, giving Maurecia time to catch up with her. The two rush up the stairs together, while Deedee starts to get ahead, but she ends up missing the final problem, letting Maurecia get the victory. At the end of the day, Joy, Ron, and Deedee meet by the flagpole, with Maurecia showing up much later due to being interviewed for her excellent performance on the Ultimate Test. The Unbreakables eventually reconcile, and the chapter notes that while helping a friend that is down is a true test of friendship, staying by a friend that is up is the ultimate test of friendship.\n\n; 27. Kachooga Boop: It is revealed that no one failed the Ultimate Test, as Mrs. Jewls designed it so each student's talent would shine. Myron begins to bring in his nail clippings for the day, bringing the total to 999,999, but is interrupted by a loud bell he has never heard before. Mrs. Jewls searches to find out what that bell means, and it turns out to be a request for immediate evacuation, as the Cloud of Doom is about to destroy everything. The students hurry out of the room, and down the stairs holding hands so they will not get lost in the darkness, but Joe slips on a skateboard, bringing everyone else down with him. The students worry about what they should do, but they notice one classroom is still open.\n\n; 28. The Teacher With the Long Fingernail: The students rush into the one active classroom, which turns out to be Miss Zarves's class on the school's missing nineteenth story, allowing Calvin to finally turn in the note he was supposed to deliver in ''[[Sideways Stories from Wayside School]]''. The class is doing their history lesson, where they are supposed to study every person who has ever lived, something that stumps all the students in Mrs. Jewls's class. Myron is handed a Chinese dictionary so he can study the people that were born in China, when he gets the idea to trim Miss Zarves's fingernail, which has grown excessively large. After clipping it, the students find themselves scattered on the staircase, with Myron holding up the millionth nail clipping.\n\n; 29. After the Storm: The students return to class after the storm, which has shuffled everything inside the school to a random other floor. In Mrs. Jewls's class, Myron places the millionth nail clipping in the bucket, though the rest are gone. As the teachers stay inside to clean the mess, the students are sent outside, where it is shown that the Cloud of Doom dropped a lot of snow over the school. The kids play a game, while they try to crash into the clumps of snow Louis is tossing off the roof, but he eventually notices Sharie's umbrella caught in the snow. He yanks it out, but ends up sliding backwards off the roof, holding the wrong end of the umbrella to use it as a parachute. He tries to grab the flagpole and misses, but the hooked end of the umbrella latches on, spinning him around in circles as he slides down. Sharie grabs back her umbrella, thanking Louis, but informing he should have used the stairs.\n\n; 30. Rainbow: Miss Mush is preparing to make the best meal ever after the Cloud of Doom is gone, and eventually settles on making rainbow stew. She gets help from her assistant, Mr. Pepperadder, to collect various colorful ingredients to use, but by the time she is serving it, she notices that it is now a grayish-brown mush. She apologizes to the students as she serves it, and the students are initially hesitant, but as they eat it, they taste the colors, and declare it the best lunch ever. Mr. Pepperadder asks what the recipe is, but Miss Mush explains there is no recipe, as no two rainbows are the same.\n\n==Reception==\n''Wayside School Beneath the Cloud of Doom'' has been met with largely positive reception from critics. Carrie Kingsley of [[Common Sense Media]] gave the book 5 out of 5 stars, claiming that \"Beneath the teachers' comically odd takes on math, spelling bees, and P.E., there's a feeling of warmth among the students as they learn to be more forgiving and to stick together. The oddball interactions between the faculty and students always comes from a place of kindness: The terrifying Ultimate Test gives every student a chance to shine, and even the dreaded lunch lady gets it right sometimes.\"<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.commonsensemedia.org/book-reviews/wayside-school-beneath-the-cloud-of-doom-wayside-school-book-4 | title=Wayside School Beneath the Cloud of Doom: Wayside School, Book 4 Book Review| date=2020 | author=Kingsley, Carrie | publisher=[[Common Sense Media]]}}</ref> ''[[Kirkus Reviews]]'' additionally published a positive review of the book, stating that even after a 25-year gap from the previous book in the series, the new entry retains an entertaining sense of humor.<ref>{{cite web |title=WAYSIDE SCHOOL BENEATH THE CLOUD OF DOOM |url=https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/louis-sachar/wayside-school-beneath-the-cloud-of-doom/ |accessdate=10 April 2020 |work=Kirkus Reviews |publisher=Kirkus Reviews |date=29 September 2019}}</ref> A review from ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' assesses the book positively as well, stating that \"Sachar\u2019s snappy comedic stride doesn\u2019t miss a beat in his series\u2019 fourth installment\u2014the first since 1995's ''Wayside School Gets a Little Stranger''\u2014as the curiosities of Mrs. Jewls's 30th-floor classroom multiply more quickly than ever.\"<ref>{{cite web |title=Children's Book Review: Wayside School Beneath the Cloud of Doom |url=https://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-06-296538-7 |publisher=Publishers Weekly |accessdate=10 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n[[Category:Novels by Louis Sachar]]\n[[Category:2020 American novels]]\n[[Category:Wayside School]]\n[[Category:American children's novels]]\n[[Category:American comedy novels]]\n[[Category:Novels set in schools]]\n[[Category:2020 children's books]]\n", "name_user": "CompliensCreator", "label": "safe", "comment": "minor cleanup", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayside_School_Beneath_the_Cloud_of_Doom"}

Users can share photos, videos, audio messages and other files (up to 1.5 [[gigabyte]] in size per file). Users can send messages to other users individually or to groups of up to 200,000 members.<ref name=\"Venture-5k\">{{cite news|url=https://twitter.com/telegram/status/922426780316774401|title=Group chats on Telegram can now have up to 1,00,000 members. Admins can use advanced permissions and butler bots to keep the peace.|date=23 October 2017|via=Twitter.com}}</ref> Sent messages can be edited within 48 hours after they have been sent and deleted at any time on both sides. This gives user an ability to correct typos and retract messages that were sent by mistake.<ref name=\"Telegram Unsend Messages\">{{Citation|url=https://telegram.org/blog/unsend-and-usage|publisher=Telegram|title=Unsend Messages, Network Usage, and More|date=3 January 2017|accessdate=4 April 2017}}</ref> The transmission of messages to Telegram Messenger LLP's servers is encrypted with the service's [[MTProto]] protocol.<ref name=\"how-secure\" /> According to Telegram's privacy policy, \"all data is stored heavily encrypted and the encryption keys in each case are stored in several other DCs in different jurisdictions. This way local engineers or physical intruders cannot get access to user data\".<ref>{{cite web|title = Telegram Privacy Policy|url = https://telegram.org/privacy|website = Telegram|access-date = 17 January 2016}}</ref> This makes the messages' security roughly comparable to that of e-mail. Here, most providers employ client-server encryption as well, however usually with the standardized protocol [[Transport Layer Security]]. E-mails may or may not be encrypted on the servers. Telegram cloud messages and media remain on the servers at least until deleted by all participants.\n\n=== Bots ===\nIn June 2015, Telegram launched a platform for third-party developers to create [[IM bot|bots]].<ref name=\"Telegram Bot Platform\">{{Citation|url=https://telegram.org/blog/bot-revolution|publisher=Telegram|title=Telegram Bot Platform|date=24 June 2015|accessdate=1 September 2015}}</ref> Bots are Telegram accounts operated by programs. They can respond to messages or [[Mention (blogging)|mentions]], can be invited into groups and can be integrated into other programs. It also accepts online payments with credit cards and [[Apple Pay]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://telegram.org/blog/payments|title=Payments for Bots|website=Telegram|access-date=2018-02-12}}</ref> Dutch website ''[[Tweakers]]'' reported that an invited bot can potentially read all group messages when the bot controller changes the access settings silently at a later point in time. Telegram pointed out that it considered implementing a feature that would announce such a status change within the relevant group.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://tweakers.net/nieuws/104386/telegram-bots-kunnen-relatief-ongemerkt-meelezen-in-groepsgesprekken.html|title = Telegram-bots kunnen relatief ongemerkt meelezen in groepsgesprekken|date = 23 July 2015|accessdate = 25 October 2015|website = [[Tweakers]]|last = Schellevis|first = Joost|language = nl}}</ref> Also there are inline bots, which can be used from any chat screen. In order to activate an inline bot, user needs to type in the message field a bot's username and query. The bot then will offer its content. User can choose from that content and send it within a chat.<ref name=\"Inline Bots\">{{Citation|url=https://telegram.org/blog/inline-bots|publisher=Telegram|title=Introducing Inline Bots|date=4 January 2016|accessdate=4 April 2017}}</ref>\n\n=== Channels ===\nIn September 2015, Telegram added channels.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://telegram.org/blog/channels|title=Channels: Broadcasting Done Right|date=2015-09-22|website=Telegram|access-date=2019-09-24}}</ref> Channels are a form of one-way messaging where admins are able to post messages but other users are not. Any user is able to create and subscribe to channels. Channels can be created for broadcasting messages to an unlimited number of subscribers.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Lobao|first1=Martim|title=Telegram v3.2 Brings Channels For Broadcasting Your Messages To The World|url=http://www.androidpolice.com/2015/09/22/telegram-v3-2-brings-channels-broadcasting-messages-world/|work=Android Police|date=22 September 2015}}</ref> Channels can be publicly available with an alias and a permanent URL so anyone can join. Users who join a channel can see the entire message history. Users can join and leave channels at any time. Depending on a channel's settings, messages may be signed with the channel's name or with the username of the admin who posted them. Non-admin users are unable to see other users who've subscribed to the channel. Furthermore, users can mute a channel, meaning that the user will still receive messages, but won't be notified. Admins can give permission to post comments on the Telegram channel with help of bots. The admin of the channel can obtain general data about the channel. Each message has its own view counter, showing how many users have seen this message, this includes views from forwarded messages. As of May 2019, the creator of a channel can add a discussion group, a separate group where messages in the channel are automatically posted for subscribers to communicate.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://telegram.org/blog/privacy-discussions-web-bots|title=Focused Privacy, Discussion Groups, Seamless Web Bots and More|date=2019-05-31|website=Telegram|access-date=2019-09-24}}</ref>\n\nIn December 2019, [[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]] moved their messenger-based newsletter service from [[WhatsApp]] to Telegram after the former banned bulk and automated messaging.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-12-04/how-to-follow-bloomberg-on-telegram|title=How to Follow Bloomberg on Telegram|last=Hess|first=Megan|date=December 3, 2019|website=Bloomberg|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=Jan 10, 2020}}</ref><ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=https://digiday.com/media/bloomberg-news-using-telegram/|title=How Bloomberg News is using Telegram|last=Ting|first=Deanna|date=2020-01-10|website=Digiday|language=en-US|access-date=2020-01-10}}</ref> The news service is attempting to grow its audience outside the U.S.<ref name=\":3\" /> \n\n=== Stickers ===\n\nStickers are cloud-based, high-definition images intended to provide more expressive [[emoji]]. When typing in an emoji, the user is offered to send the respective sticker instead. Stickers come in collections called \"sets\", and multiple stickers can be offered for one emoji. Telegram comes with one default sticker set,<ref name=\"Telegram Stickers\">{{Citation|url=https://telegram.org/blog/stickers-meet-art-and-history|publisher=Telegram|title=Telegram Stickers|date=2 January 2015|accessdate=5 January 2016}}</ref> but users can install additional sticker sets provided by third-party contributors. Sticker sets installed from one client become automatically available to all other clients. Sticker images use [[WebP]] file format, which is better optimized to be transmitted over internet.\n\n=== Drafts ===\n\nDrafts are unfinished messages synced across user devices. One can start typing a message on one device and continue on another. The draft will persist in editing area on any device until it is sent or removed.<ref name=\"Drafts\">{{Citation|url=https://telegram.org/blog/drafts|publisher=Telegram|title=Drafts, Picture-in-Picture, and More|date=14 June 2016|accessdate=4 April 2017}}</ref>\n\n=== Secret chats ===\n[[File:Telegram secret chat - en.png|thumb|200px|A \"secret chat\" confirmation notice - screenshot from [[Android Marshmallow]].]]\nMessages can also be sent with client-to-client encryption in so-called secret chats. These messages are encrypted with the service's [[MTProto]] protocol.<ref name=\"techfaq\" /> Unlike Telegram's cloud-based messages, messages sent within a secret chat can be accessed only on the device upon which the secret chat was initiated and the device upon which the secret chat was accepted; they cannot be accessed on other devices.<ref name=\"TechCrunch\" /><ref name=\"how-secure\">{{Citation|url=https://telegram.org/faq#q-how-secure-is-telegram|publisher=Telegram|work=FAQ|title=How secure is Telegram?}}</ref><ref>{{Citation|publisher=Telegram|url=https://core.telegram.org/mtproto|title=Description of MTProto Mobile Protocol}}</ref> Messages sent within secret chats can, in principle, be deleted at any time and can optionally self-destruct.<ref>{{harvnb|Rottermanner|Kieseberg|Huber|Schmiedecker|2015|p=2}}</ref>\n\nSecret chats have to be initiated and accepted by an invitation, upon which the encryption keys for the session are exchanged. Users in a secret chat can verify that no [[man-in-the-middle attack]] has occurred by comparing pictures that visualize their [[public key fingerprint]]s.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Hamburger|first1=Ellis|title=Why Telegram has become the hottest messaging app in the world|url=https://www.theverge.com/2014/2/25/5445864/telegram-messenger-hottest-app-in-the-world|website=The Verge|publisher=Vox Media|accessdate=17 March 2016|date=25 February 2014}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Telegram, secret chats have supported [[perfect forward secrecy]] since December 2014.

The calls are built upon the end-to-end encryption of Secret Chats. Connection is established as [[peer-to-peer]] whenever possible, otherwise the closest server to the client is used. According to Telegram, there is a [[Artificial neural network|neural network]] working to learn various technical parameters about a call to provide better quality of the service for future uses. After a brief initial trial in Western Europe, voice calls are now available for use in most countries.<ref name=\"Telegram Voice Calls\">{{Citation|url=https://telegram.org/blog/calls|publisher=Telegram|title=Voice Calls: Secure, Crystal-Clear, AI-Powered|date=30 March 2017|accessdate=3 April 2017}}</ref>\n\n=== Telescope (video messages) ===\nSince version 4.1, released in May 2017, Telegram offers a dedicated video hosting platform called Telescope.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://telegram.org/blog/video-messages-and-telescope|title=Video Messages and Telescope|website=Telegram|access-date=2018-03-05}}</ref> The round videos can be up to one minute long and autoplay. When posted in a public channel on Telegram, the videos are also uploaded to and viewable without an account. However, Telegram video messages and \"Telescope\" videos sent within non-public chats or groups are not published.\n\n=== Live locations ===\nFor either 15 minutes, one hour, or eight hours, Telegram users can share their live location in a chat since version 4.4 released in October 2017.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://telegram.org/blog/live-locations|title=Live Locations, Media Player and Languages|website=Telegram|access-date=2018-03-05}}</ref> If multiple users share their live location within a group, they are shown on an interactive map. Sharing the 'live location' can be stopped at any time.\n\n=== Social login ===\nIn February 2018, Telegram launched their [[social login]] feature to its users, named as Telegram Login.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://telegram.org/blog/login|title=Telegram Login for Websites|website=Telegram|access-date=2018-02-12}}</ref> It features a website widget that could be embedded into websites, allowing users to sign into a third party website with their Telegram account. The gateway sends users' Telegram name, username, and profile picture to the website owner, while users' phone number remains hidden. The gateway is integrated with a bot, which is linked with the developer's specific website domain.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.neowin.net/news/telegram-48-arrives-with-telegram-login-and-streaming|title=Telegram 4.8 arrives with Telegram Login and streaming|work=Neowin|access-date=2018-02-12|language=en}}</ref>\n\n=== Passport ===\nIn July 2018, Telegram introduced their [[online authorisation]] and [[identity management system]], Telegram Passport, for platforms that require real-life identification.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://telegram.org/blog/passport|title=Introducing Telegram Passport|website=Telegram|access-date=2018-08-04}}</ref> It asks users to upload their own official documents such as passport, identity card, driver license, etc. When an online service requires such identification documents and verification, it forwards the information to the platform with the user's permission. Telegram stated that it does not have access to the data, while the platform will only share the information to the authorised recipient.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.engadget.com/2018/07/27/telegram-passport/|title=Telegram Passport stores your real-world IDs in the cloud|work=Engadget|access-date=2018-08-04|language=en-US}}</ref> However, the service was criticised for being vulnerable to online [[Brute-force attack|brute force attacks]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://thenextweb.com/hardfork/2018/08/02/telegram-passport-passwords-crack/|title=Telegram Passport is already drawing fire for not being secure enough|last=Canellis|first=David|date=2018-08-02|work=Hard Fork {{!}} The Next Web|access-date=2018-08-04|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n== Architecture ==\n\n=== Encryption scheme ===\n[[File:Explanation of secret chats (Telegram).png|thumb|200px|A simplified illustration of the MTProto encryption scheme.]]\nTelegram uses a [[symmetric encryption]] scheme called [[MTProto]]. The protocol was developed by [[Nikolai Durov]] and other developers at Telegram and is based on 256-bit symmetric [[Advanced Encryption Standard|AES]] encryption, 2048-bit [[RSA (cryptosystem)|RSA]] encryption and [[Diffie\u2013Hellman key exchange]].<ref name=\"techfaq\">{{cite web|url = https://core.telegram.org/techfaq|title = FAQ for the Technically Inclined|website = Telegram|accessdate = 9 January 2016}}</ref>\n\n=== Servers ===\nTelegram Messenger LLP has servers in a number of countries throughout the world to improve the response time of their service.<ref>{{cite web|trans-title=Telegram, the chat that competes with WhatsApp|place=[[Uruguay|UY]]|url=http://www.elpais.com.uy/vida-actual/que-telegram-chat-que-compite.html|work=El Pa\u00eds|title=Telegram, el chat que compite con Whatsapp|language=es|accessdate=8 January 2016}}</ref> Telegram's server-side software is closed-source and proprietary.

Among the aspects considered were: the security of the data transmission, the service's terms of use, the accessibility of the source code and the distribution of the app. Telegram was rated 'critical' (''{{Lang|de|kritisch}}'') overall. The organization was favorable to Telegram's secure chats and partially open source code, but criticized the mandatory transfer of contact data to Telegram's servers and the lack of an imprint or address on the service's website. It noted that while the message data is encrypted on the device, it could not analyse the transmission due to a lack of source code.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.test.de/WhatsApp-und-Alternativen-Datenschutz-im-Test-4675013-0/|title=WhatsApp und Alternativen: Datenschutz im Test|date=26 February 2014|website=[[Stiftung Warentest]]|language=de|trans-title=WhatsApp and alternatives: data protection tested|access-date=2 March 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] (EFF) listed Telegram on its \"Secure Messaging Scorecard\" in February 2015. Telegram's default chat function received a score of 4 out of 7 points on the scorecard. It received points for having communications encrypted in transit, having its code open to independent review, having the security design properly documented, and having completed a recent independent security audit. Telegram's default chat function missed points because the communications were not encrypted with keys the provider didn't have access to, users could not verify contacts' identities, and past messages were not secure if the encryption keys were stolen.

Users can share photos, videos, audio messages and other files (up to 1.5 [[gigabyte]] in size per file). Users can send messages to other users individually or to groups of up to 200,000 members.<ref name=\"Venture-5k\">{{cite news|url=https://twitter.com/telegram/status/922426780316774401|title=Group chats on Telegram can now have up to 1,00,000 members.

This way local engineers or physical intruders cannot get access to user data\".<ref>{{cite web|title = Telegram Privacy Policy|url = https://telegram.org/privacy|website = Telegram|access-date = 17 January 2016}}</ref> This makes the messages' security roughly comparable to that of e-mail. Here, most providers employ client-server encryption as well, however usually with the standardized protocol [[Transport Layer Security]]. E-mails may or may not be encrypted on the servers. Telegram cloud messages and media remain on the servers at least until deleted by all participants.\n\n=== Bots ===\nIn June 2015, Telegram launched a platform for third-party developers to create [[IM bot|bots]].<ref name=\"Telegram Bot Platform\">{{Citation|url=https://telegram.org/blog/bot-revolution|publisher=Telegram|title=Telegram Bot Platform|date=24 June 2015|accessdate=1 September 2015}}</ref> Bots are Telegram accounts operated by programs.

In order to activate an inline bot, user needs to type in the message field a bot's username and query. The bot then will offer its content. User can choose from that content and send it within a chat.<ref name=\"Inline Bots\">{{Citation|url=https://telegram.org/blog/inline-bots|publisher=Telegram|title=Introducing Inline Bots|date=4 January 2016|accessdate=4 April 2017}}</ref>\n\n=== Channels ===\nIn September 2015, Telegram added channels.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://telegram.org/blog/channels|title=Channels: Broadcasting Done Right|date=2015-09-22|website=Telegram|access-date=2019-09-24}}</ref> Channels are a form of one-way messaging where admins are able to post messages but other users are not. Any user is able to create and subscribe to channels. Channels can be created for broadcasting messages to an unlimited number of subscribers.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Lobao|first1=Martim|title=Telegram v3.2 Brings Channels For Broadcasting Your Messages To The World|url=http://www.androidpolice.com/2015/09/22/telegram-v3-2-brings-channels-broadcasting-messages-world/|work=Android Police|date=22 September 2015}}</ref> Channels can be publicly available with an alias and a permanent URL so anyone can join. Users who join a channel can see the entire message history. Users can join and leave channels at any time. Depending on a channel's settings, messages may be signed with the channel's name or with the username of the admin who posted them. Non-admin users are unable to see other users who've subscribed to the channel. Furthermore, users can mute a channel, meaning that the user will still receive messages, but won't be notified. Admins can give permission to post comments on the Telegram channel with help of bots. The admin of the channel can obtain general data about the channel. Each message has its own view counter, showing how many users have seen this message, this includes views from forwarded messages. As of May 2019, the creator of a channel can add a discussion group, a separate group where messages in the channel are automatically posted for subscribers to communicate.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://telegram.org/blog/privacy-discussions-web-bots|title=Focused Privacy, Discussion Groups, Seamless Web Bots and More|date=2019-05-31|website=Telegram|access-date=2019-09-24}}</ref>\n\nIn December 2019, [[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]] moved their messenger-based newsletter service from [[WhatsApp]] to Telegram after the former banned bulk and automated messaging.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-12-04/how-to-follow-bloomberg-on-telegram|title=How to Follow Bloomberg on Telegram|last=Hess|first=Megan|date=December 3, 2019|website=Bloomberg|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=Jan 10, 2020}}</ref><ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=https://digiday.com/media/bloomberg-news-using-telegram/|title=How Bloomberg News is using Telegram|last=Ting|first=Deanna|date=2020-01-10|website=Digiday|language=en-US|access-date=2020-01-10}}</ref> The news service is attempting to grow its audience outside the U.S.<ref name=\":3\" /> \n\n=== Stickers ===\n\nStickers are cloud-based, high-definition images intended to provide more expressive [[emoji]]. When typing in an emoji, the user is offered to send the respective sticker instead. Stickers come in collections called \"sets\", and multiple stickers can be offered for one emoji. Telegram comes with one default sticker set,<ref name=\"Telegram Stickers\">{{Citation|url=https://telegram.org/blog/stickers-meet-art-and-history|publisher=Telegram|title=Telegram Stickers|date=2 January 2015|accessdate=5 January 2016}}</ref> but users can install additional sticker sets provided by third-party contributors. Sticker sets installed from one client become automatically available to all other clients. Sticker images use [[WebP]] file format, which is better optimized to be transmitted over internet.\n\n=== Drafts ===\n\nDrafts are unfinished messages synced across user devices. One can start typing a message on one device and continue on another.

The calls are built upon the end-to-end encryption of Secret Chats. Connection is established as [[peer-to-peer]] whenever possible, otherwise the closest server to the client is used. According to Telegram, there is a [[Artificial neural network|neural network]] working to learn various technical parameters about a call to provide better quality of the service for future uses. After a brief initial trial in Western Europe, voice calls are now available for use in most countries.<ref name=\"Telegram Voice Calls\">{{Citation|url=https://telegram.org/blog/calls|publisher=Telegram|title=Voice Calls: Secure, Crystal-Clear, AI-Powered|date=30 March 2017|accessdate=3 April 2017}}</ref>\n\n=== Telescope (video messages) ===\nSince version 4.1, released in May 2017, Telegram offers a dedicated video hosting platform called Telescope.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://telegram.org/blog/video-messages-and-telescope|title=Video Messages and Telescope|website=Telegram|access-date=2018-03-05}}</ref> The round videos can be up to one minute long and autoplay. When posted in a public channel on Telegram, the videos are also uploaded to and viewable without an account. However, Telegram video messages and \"Telescope\" videos sent within non-public chats or groups are not published.\n\n=== Live locations ===\nFor either 15 minutes, one hour, or eight hours, Telegram users can share their live location in a chat since version 4.4 released in October 2017.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://telegram.org/blog/live-locations|title=Live Locations, Media Player and Languages|website=Telegram|access-date=2018-03-05}}</ref> If multiple users share their live location within a group, they are shown on an interactive map.

As of 2017, nearly 25% of the population of the five metropolitan capitals (Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Perth and Adelaide) were listening to DAB+ radio each week.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://communications.gov.au/publications/digital-radio-report|title=Australian Government report on Digital Radio|access-date=1 September 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170302090019/https://www.communications.gov.au/publications/digital-radio-report|archive-date=2 March 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> Over 3 million digital radios have been sold with listeners being able to receive over 380 DAB+ devices.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.worlddab.org/country-information/australia|title=WorldDAB Country Report - Australia}}</ref>\n\n==Austria==\nDigital Radio Austria (Verein Digitalradio \u00d6sterreich) will apply for a DAB+ trial license. Two transmitters will operate as a single frequency network, with one transmitting a 10&nbsp;kW signal. This test mode is scheduled to last a year, with the possibility of an extension in to 2015. The twelve radio stations which will take part in the trial are being selected. Unlike earlier trials, consumers will receive more information on this new way of radio consumption and there will be a large volume of digital radios available in consumer electronic shops.\n\nAustria is committed to a digital radio future and a report by the regulators, the Austrian Communications Authority (KommAustria) and RTR-GmbH recommended DAB+ in Band III as the way forward. As planned, KommAustria completed a call for interest regarding DAB+ in August 2012. KommAustria intended to launch DAB+ by an open call for tender regarding the DAB+ network if enough parties showed believable and sustainable interest. A minimum limit of 12 possible programs (to fill one MUX coverage) was set. Unfortunately this limit was not reached as too few parties showed interest or failed to meet the criteria of the call for interest. Most remarkably, the public broadcaster ORF and the bigger players in the Austrian market did not show interest but strongly voiced their opposition against the launch of DAB+ in Austria. However, there is a group of broadcasters who are very outspoken in favour of DAB+, but the majority of radio stations remain unsure. The public broadcaster ORF has renewed its objection to any DAB+ plans. In the upcoming \"Digitalisation Concept\" which marks the authority's official strategy and schedule for the digitalisation of broadcasting, KommAustria plans to elaborate on the technical details of a possible DAB+ network. There will be no further calls for interest but the possibility for a call for tender upon request. Nevertheless, a working group that was created in 2009 to consider the countries digital future is still at work. Its members are stakeholders from the Austrian radio market who represent opponents and proponents of digital radio. It consists of the regulatory authority, the public broadcaster ORF, the commercial and non-commercial broadcasters associations, the electronic industry and consumer associations. The group is constantly watching and evaluating the progress of digital radio in other European countries. The success of digital radio in Germany will affect whether Austria decides to implement DAB+.\n\nThe Austrian Association of the Electrical and Electronic Industry (FEEI), and Austrian radio stations such as Radio Arabella and LoungeFM have founded the digital radio club, Digital Radio Austria. The aim of the new organisation is the promotion and development of digital radio in Austria, developing the media category \"Radio\" in the digital media world, the establishment of radio on new platforms and to promote the provision of information and support for education and training in the field of electronic and new media.\n<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.worlddab.org/country-information/austria|title=Austria &#124; Country Information &#124; WorldDAB|website=www.worlddab.org}}</ref>\n\n==Belgium==\n===French (Wallonia and Brussels)===\n\nThe [[Radio T\u00e9l\u00e9vision Belge de la Communaut\u00e9 Fran\u00e7aise]] (RTBF) is the public broadcaster for the [[French Community of Belgium|Belgian French speaking community]]. Since 1998, RTBF has operated one DAB multiplex simulcasting its five FM radio stations and two [[Belgischer Rundfunk|BRF]] (the [[German-speaking Community of Belgium|Belgian German speaking]] public broadcaster) FM radio stations, covering of Brussels and Wallonia. On this multiplex, RTBF is also testing four DAB+ audio and data channels (indifferent bit rates and with slideshows) for itself and also for the private radio stations. The aim is to plan a roadmap for DAB+ in French speaking Belgium together with the private broadcasters, subject to approval from the French Community Government and the regulator, the [[Conseil Sup\u00e9rieur de l\u2019Audiovisuel]] (CSA). In Spring 2011 a common vision of the main broadcasters, both private and public, was defined with a four-tier strategy for migration from analogue to digital radio (DAB+ broadcast; hybrid radio; single online radio player and radio on TV). In summer 2011 the Parliament of the French-speaking Community adopted unanimously a resolution asking the French-speaking Government to support the migration to digital radio from 2011 onwards.\n\nThe CSA (regulator) launched a public consultation about digital radio in autumn 2011 which provided positive feedback. In spring 2012, the CSA recommended to the Government a DAB+ rollout based mainly on two layers in Band III. In June 2012 the Government authorized RTBF to proceed with DAB+ trials for commercial and non-profit radio stations licensed by the CSA.\n\nThe next step is to achieve a public funding agreement to finance the investments needed for the technical DAB+ rollout, upgrade of the RTBF DAB network to DAB+ to ensure deep indoor coverage of Brussels and Wallonia, for a potential public launch in 2015 (to mark the 101st anniversary of the first radio broadcasting in Belgium). RTBF is testing Radio DNS interactive slideshows on its DAB+ channels.\n\n===Flemish (Flanders and Brussels)===\n\nThe [[Vlaamse Radio- en Televisieomroeporganisatie]] (VRT) is the public broadcaster for the Belgian Flemish Community. VRT has one DAB multiplex in operation with eight radio stations: the 5 FM-also stations Radio 1, Radio 2, Klara, Studio Brussel and MNM and three digital-only channels: Nieuws+ (news), Klara Continuo (non-stop classic and older music) and MNM Hits (Top 40).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vrt.be/nl/aanbod/kijk-en-luister/radio-luisteren/dab-|title=DAB+ &#124; VRT.be|website=www.vrt.be}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vrt.be/nl/heb-je-een-vraag/vragen-over-dab-|title=Vragen over DAB+ &#124; VRT.be|website=www.vrt.be}}</ref> Norkring, which operates VRT's multiplex, also has a license for another multiplex and is wording on a DAB+ roll out.

Nantes was already allowed until the end of the year. \nIn January 2012 it was reported by the French newspaper \u2018Les Echos\u2019 that the CSA had requested the Ministry of Industry to include DAB+ in the technical standard for France. The consultation for this closed in May 2012 and the technical decree was released 16 August 2013, including DAB+ to the list of permitted standards. At the end of 2007, France's Government announced that the official standard for digital radio in France would be DMB-A, to be marketed as Radio Num\u00e9rique Terrestre (RNT).\n\nAt the end of 2013, the French Parliament will examine an update of the 1986 law about radio and television. Then the CSA should publish a timetable for a call for applications for tenders for digital terrestrial licenses for France's next 20 biggest cities which will add up to 62% coverage. An additional tender will also allow to add DAB+ services to the 14 multiplexes in Paris, Marseille and Nice, as well as five more multiplexes in these towns.\n\nIn April 2012 the CSA re-launched a call of tender for three cities (Paris for seven multiplexes, Marseille and Nice for six multiplexes each). The four main commercial radio groups decided do not bid and the government did not allow the public service (Radio France) to pre-empt frequencies. At the beginning of October 2012 the CSA published the candidates selected for the three cities. At the beginning of 2014, six multiplexes will be on air in Paris, four in Marseille and four in Nice.\n\nRoll out of terrestrial digital radio was scheduled to start in December 2009 but was postponed amid opposition from several sources, including private radio operators. The Prime Minister commissioned a further report by David Kessler, former chief executive France Culture, which was published in mid-2011 and suggested that the conditions had not been met for the full scale deployment of digital radio in France. The report suggested a moratorium of two to three years during which time the French market would look at\nthe deployment of digital radio in the rest of Europe. The report also stated that the government approved the CSA's decision to allow further trials to continue.\n\nThe CSA is responsible for taking the findings of the Kessler report forward and in order to do this set up an \u2018Observatory\u2019 which includes all of the industry players. The publication of the Kessler report meant the market could move forward after a period of stagnation and to this end various trials were put on-air (Paris, Nantes, Marseille and Lyon).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.worlddab.org/country-information/france|title=France &#124; Country Information &#124; WorldDAB|website=www.worlddab.org|access-date=29 April 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150220000457/https://www.worlddab.org/country-information/france|archive-date=20 February 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==Germany==\nBy the end of 2013 more than 120 national, regional and local programs will be broadcast in Germany. Also more than 90% of the German population can listen to at least one digital radio ensemble. This is considered to be a respectable success two years after the launch.\n\nDespite some changes in the national multiplex, the prospect for both commercial and public broadcasters is very positive as receiver sales are increasing. Furthermore, a stable ecosystem of private digital radio stations could be established in metropolitan areas such as Frankfurt, Berlin and Munich.\n\nThe current focus of broadcasters and network operators is to continue their marketing efforts in all media. For this reason the initiative \u2018Digitalradio Deutschland\u2019 was founded by the commercial broadcasters on the national multiplex (represented by DRD GmbH), the ARD group, Deutschlandradio and the network operator Media Broadcast. The goal is to coordinate the b2b and b2c marketing initiatives of all stakeholders to foster the evolution of digital radio in Germany by obtaining a reasonable market penetration by end of 2014.\n\nCoordination with the device industry is carried out via the initiative \u2018Digitalradio Deutschland\u2019, organised by the German Federal Ministry of Economics and Technology (BMWi). Five working groups were created to guide all areas of digital radio development and roll out, such as receiver/devices, data and traffic services, networks or advertisements.\n\nThe initiative hired consumer electronics market professionals which significantly improved the communication with the retailers. Many stores are now equipped with in-house-coverage solutions. The German car manufacturers offer DAB+ receivers for nearly all models either as an option or line fit. Two commercial telematics service providers use data capacity on the national mux to transmit TPEG based traffic information via DAB. The impressive coverage of Germany's highways over the last two years was secured through market collaboration and support for the technology.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.worlddab.org/country-information/germany|title=Germany &#124; Country Information &#124; WorldDAB|website=www.worlddab.org|access-date=29 April 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180724032907/https://www.worlddab.org/country-information/germany|archive-date=24 July 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==Ghana==\nOn 14 May 2008 FonTV, Africa's first mobile phone enabled television content service, was launched via DMB.

The sole DAB+ equipment (from head-end to transmitter) are owned and operated by the public broadcaster, Radio TV Malaysia (RTM).\n\nIn February 2013, RTM invited local agencies such as the Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission (MCMC), various members of the local radio industry and Telecoms Malaysia to a joint field trial study. Some elements of the field trials included identifying minimum reception figures for in building reception loss, minimum figures for acceptable mobile reception and speed tests.\n\nConsidering the conservative power of the trial DAB+ transmitter of 1&nbsp;kW, the results of the field trial looks promising and are in line with figures already established by the ITU and in broadcasting agencies in Australia.\n15 FM radio programs are available on the DAB+ platform, nine from RTM and six from the commercial radio stations.\n\nEfforts are underway to study/familiarise staff with other aspects of the DAB+ system such as adding Slideshow (SLS) and text (DL) in order to maximize the full potential of DAB+. Therefore, Malaysia is still gaining familiarity, experience and confidence with DAB+ technology.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.worlddab.org/country-information/malaysia|title=Malaysia &#124; Country Information &#124; WorldDAB|website=www.worlddab.org}}</ref>\n\n==Malta==\nMalta was the first European country to roll out a DAB+ network and services were on-air in October 2008. There\nare nearly 40 services on the two national multiplexes which include unique digital only stations, MOT, EPG and DLS applications. The multiplexes are operated by Digi B Network and cover 100% of the population. By the end of 2012, over 25% of Maltese radio listeners were tuning in via DAB+.\n\nA second national mux (6A \u2013 Digi B2) was launched in 2011. The use of the digital radio platform has increased by 4.12% to 13% over the same period last year (January\u2013March 2012) and the use of FM has dropped by 7%.

The trials were not well received by northern Mexican radio stations, whose owners feared losing access to American audiences, as that country had already decided against DAB. While there was support for digital radio via the DAB family of standards among some Mexican broadcasters, the primary use of the L-band in Mexico is for maritime transmissions and space communications.\n\nIn 2008, the [[Cofetel|Federal Telecommunications Commission]] authorized IBOC for all stations within {{convert|320|km|mi}} of the US border.<ref>\"Mexico Authorizes Transmission of HD Radio Broadcasting\", ''Wireless News'' 27 May 2008</ref> In 2011, Cofetel allowed other stations in the country to use IBOC.\n\n==Monaco==\nA T-DMB test was carried out in VHF Band III on Channel 6A between July 2009 and September 2009. Monaco and the area around it has a transmitter, but due to some on-going technical issues, at present digital radio in Monaco is on hold.\n\nPrior to this, the principality of Monaco broadcast DAB digital radio services to 100% of its population of 32,000 people since 2005.

The conditions for the transition were:\n\n# Coverage (absolute condition for FM shutdown): Before 2015, the public broadcaster NRK must achieve coverage of 99.5%, the commercial broadcasters on the national network #1 are required to reach 90% of the population\n#Value added for the listeners (absolute condition for FM shutdown). There must be a value added for the listeners in going from FM to DAB, both in terms of available content and in terms of user experience.\n#Digital listening (condition to be met in order to shut down FM in 2017. Failure to reach it can postpone the shutdown until 2019). Before 2015 50% of the radio listeners must daily use a digital radio platform (currently this is 45%). This does not specify market share of listening, contrary to the UK requirement, only reach. \"Digital platform\" also includes listening via internet and via the digital TV network. This condition is set in order to measure the listeners' independence of the analogue FM-platform.\n#In-car solution (condition to be met in order to shut down FM in 2017. Failure to reach it can postpone the shutdown until 2019). Before 2015, there must be reasonably priced, well-functioning in-car adaptors on the market. In half of all Norwegian municipalities there must be an offer of in-car DAB-adaptor installation.\n\nAfter 2017, local stations, except for stations in major cities, will have the option to continue FM broadcasting. The report leaves it to the broadcasters to choose between DAB or DAB+ transmissions. By 2017, all DAB broadcasting in Norway is in DAB+ format.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.worlddab.org/country-information/norway|title=Norway &#124; Country Information &#124; WorldDAB|website=www.worlddab.org}}</ref>\n\nThe switch-off of national FM broadcasting proved controversial and provoked a public backlash. NRK also faced a significant drop in listening figures following the switch-off.\n\n==Poland==\nAs of September 2016, Poland has one nationwide DAB+ multiplex, which consists of eight nationwide stations:\n* 4 FM-available stations ([[Polskie Radio Program I|Jedynka]], [[Polskie Radio Program II|Dw\u00f3jka]], [[Polskie Radio Program III|Tr\u00f3jka]], [[Polskie Radio 24|PR24]])\n* 3 DAB-only stations ([[Polskie Radio Program IV|Czw\u00f3rka]], Radio Dzieciom, Radio Rytm)\n* [[Polish Radio External Service|Radio Poland]] - DAB-only in Poland, but in some countries also on FM or SW.\nThe multiplex can include one or two regional stations (some of them also FM-available), but it differ between Polskie Radio regional stations. It can be received in many parts of the country thanks to twenty six transmitters, but due to very low listening figures and high costs plans for future extensions (also new stations) have been ceased and digital radio switch-off is proposed. \nThere are also two local test multiplexes in [[Siedlce]] and [[Rzesz\u00f3w]], which consist of local stations.\n\n==Portugal==\nExpansion of the DAB network awaits a decision by the Portuguese government.

September 2016.\n\n==South Africa==\nThe Joint SADIBA/NAB Digital Radio DAB+ Trial Working group's application for a high\u2013powered DAB+ trial licence has been approved. The trial licence was granted to the South African Broadcasting Corporation (the applicant on behalf of the NAB radio members) by the regulator, the Independent Communications Authority of South Africa (ICASA). The trial will run from 1 April 2014 to 31 March 2015, and Sentech will be the signal distributor for the duration of the trial.\n\nThe SADIBA/NAB Working group is encouraged by the commitment of all stakeholders in putting digital radio firmly on the South African broadcasting agenda.\n\nThe South African DAB+ trial will consist of two high power transmitting stations (10&nbsp;kW transmitter power) 100&nbsp;kW ERP situated in Johannesburg and Pretoria in the province of Gauteng. The trial will operate as a SFN in VHF band III on Channel 13F on a frequency of 239.200&nbsp;MHz. This will happen after coverage verification at transmitter powers of 2&nbsp;kW, 5&nbsp;kW, and 10&nbsp;kW. The total area covered by the trial is 21185km2 and the total gross population covered is 10 705 387 (21.5% of total SA population). It is envisaged that between 18 and 20 radio from the Public, Commercial and Community sectors will participate in the trial. The trial will allow the testing of:\nEnd-to-end technical functionality\nExtent of portable mobile coverage\nSignal permeability\nDemonstrate digital radio services and value-added services\nPerformance in the field using typical consumer equipment and professional test and measurement equipment.\nThe effects of vehicle penetration loss, building penetration loss and clutter (e.g. buildings and vegetation) on coverage.\nTesting of the various encoding methods (stereo, para stereo, mono) for different audio types and at different bit rates to get a good understanding of what bit rates/encoding to use for the different program types.\nInvestigate the delivery of PAD within these tests, synchronisation with the audio and rate of change of the images.  \nIn July 2013 over 200 radio industry representatives came together at the South African Broadcasting Corporation's (SABC) facility in Johannesburg to attend a landmark workshop on the rollout of DAB+ digital radio and to discuss plans for a high-powered DAB+ trial transmission extending from Pretoria to Johannesburg by end 2013. The Independent Communications Authority of South Africa (ICASA), indicated that it stands ready to support broadcasting innovation in South Africa, which will be the first country to exploit opportunities for delivery of educational services via DAB+, as well as services for those with disabilities. Broadcasting radio via DAB+ will also allow ICASA to license new entrants where FM bandwidth is congested.\n\nMobileTV PTY performed technical tests of DMB (Digital Multimedia Broadcasting) and DAB+ in Gauteng from August 2011 until the end of July 2013 and plans to expand trials in South Africa. The prospective broadcaster will launch trials of DMB technology in the Free State and the Western Cape before the end of the 2013. In July 2012 they applied for a commercial license and expect to get an answer during 2013. ICASA has granted test licences for Cape and Bloemfontein, while assessing new applications for Port Eliazbeth, East London and Mpumalanga. MobileTV PTY aims to switch on the trials in Cape Town and Bloemfontein on 1 October and 1 November respectively. Their two transmitters will be relocated from Pretoria and Johannesburg Autumn 2013.\n\nMobileTV PTY ran two TV channels and one radio station on a test license. If a license is granted they would then cover 15-20 million of the 45 million people in South Africa and expand coverage in parallel to sales of devices and uptake of services. MobileTV PTY has teamed up with SABC, the public service broadcaster in South Africa. SABC reaches 76% of the population daily and is by far the biggest broadcaster and is partially financed by a TV license and partially by advertisements. MobileTV PTY is in dialogue with the Department of Education to evaluate whether the technology can be used for educational purposes, such as to reach rural schools and colleges in a cost-effective manner. The Department is primarily interested in the abilities of data transfer but an educational TV channel has not been ruled out. SABC will offer their 18 radio channels. MobileTV PTY wishes to also offer distribution for private radio stations following the launch.\n\nNo programmes are on air. Mobile TV PTY is awaiting a commercial license from the government. If licences are granted they will within the first year cover up to 50% of the population of South Africa, although they aim to increase this to between 80 and 90% within 2\u20133 years. Their plan is to broadcast 6-10 mobile TV channels and two radio stations. Additional services that combine broadcasting and the internet on the same device will be an essential part of their business model. Such services include traffic information, gambling, integration with social media and touch-screen shopping.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.worlddab.org/country-information/south-africa|title=South Africa &#124; Country Information &#124; WorldDAB|website=www.worlddab.org}}</ref>\n\n==South Korea==\nAs the first country to commercially launch mobile TV, South Korea is the most successful DMB market in the world. More than 62 million DMB enabled devices have been sold, of which the most popular are mobile phones. This number is expected to rise even more with an increase in coverage; services already cover over 80% of the country. Hundreds of DMB devices are available in this market and usage of mobile TV increases year on year. Interactive services are also growing in popularity adding value to broadcasting services.\n\nThe Korean government has set up a digital audio project to recommend a digital audio broadcasting standard for Korea.  Following ETRI's investigation of various digital radio platforms, a major decision is expected regarding the adoption of a digital radio technology for South Korean broadcasters.\n\nKorea's latest innovation is an interactive mobile TV service, or Smart DMB, launched in May 2011 with six terrestrial-DMB operators (T-DMB). With Smart DMB, mobile TV viewers are able to search the internet, receive EPG information updates, and even enjoy \u2018TV Screen Capture and Share Service\u2019 through SNS while watching television. Moreover, hybrid DMB was launched in Aug 2013 for the high quality video service.\n\nA DAB+ trial has been on air in Seoul since December 2013.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.worlddab.org/country-information/south-korea|title=South Korea &#124; Country Information &#124; WorldDAB|website=www.worlddab.org|access-date=29 April 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170710122752/https://www.worlddab.org/country-information/south-korea|archive-date=10 July 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==Spain==\nA total of 18 DAB audio services are on air. Population coverage is currently 20%. The Spanish DAB Association ([http://www.radiodigitaldab.com/index.htm Asociaci\u00f3n Foro de la Radio Digital]) comprising both national private and public broadcasters, is responsible for DAB/DAB+ in Spain.\n\nSpain first began broadcasting terrestrial digital radio in April 1998 covering Madrid, Barcelona and Valencia. From 2002 to June 2011, 23 transmitters covered the 52% of the Spanish population through three national multiplexes (1 SFN and 2 MFN). In addition, in some Comunidades Aut\u00f3nomas, DAB services were launched on additional regional multiplexes, but  they are currently switched off.\n\nThe Council of Ministers reached an agreement on Digital Radio in June 2011 and approved a Digitalisation Plan for Terrestrial Broadcasting with the following measures:\n\n#Reduction of DAB coverage from 52% to 20%, in order to facilitate a migration to DAB+\n#Flexibility for the broadcasters, in order to allow for  migration to DAB+\n#Study of a possible reassignment of the multiplexes\n#Promotional activities through the Spanish DAB Forum\n#DAB+ trials\n#A study of the necessary conditions to determine the date of  a possible analogue switch off<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.worlddab.org/country-information/spain|title=Spain &#124; Country Information &#124; WorldDAB|website=www.worlddab.org}}</ref>\n\n==Sweden==\nDAB transmissions in Sweden started on 27 September 1995 and today the coverage (MUX1) is 35% of the population with services from public service broadcaster Swedish Radio (SR). The license under which SR operates is valid until 31 December 2019.\n\nDuring the years several propositions have been put forward to the Parliament suggesting a larger digital radio network roll-out for public service broadcaster SR. This is seen as the first step to a switchover from analogue FM to digital DAB/DAB+.\n\nIn 2009, trial transmissions of DAB+ started and the coverage (MUX 2) quickly reached 22% of the population with 16 services from public service radio, commercial radio and community local radio.\n\nIn 2010, the Radio and TV Act came into effect which, for the first time, allowed commercial radio companies to apply for digital licenses. This paved the way for a radio industry united behind DAB+, something for which both public and commercial services have been lobbying for. At the same time, the Swedish Government allocated spectrum for a total of four nationwide multiplexers in VHF band III to digital radio DAB/DAB+. Two multiplexers are reserved for SR and two multiplexers are reserved for commercial radio. Three of the multiplexers are regionally MFNs and one multiplexer is a nationwide SFN on channel 12B.\n\nIn 2012, the license regulator (MRTV) started the license process for commercial digital radio. All major commercial broadcasters, representing 91% of all listening not counting SR, applied for a total of 22 audio programme licenses spread over 2 commercial multiplexers.\n\nIn 2013, the Government appointed a Digital radio Industry Coordinator to put forward a Digital Switchover (DSO) plan at the latest in November 2014 after consultation with SR and the commercial radio broadcasters. The purpose of this plan is to put forward a proposition on DSO for a decision by the Swedish Parliament.\n \t\nIn 2014 the radio industry saw the commercial licenses issued. However the Switchover Plan put forward by the Digital Radio Industry Coordinator.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.worlddab.org/country-information/sweden|title=Sweden &#124; Country Information &#124; WorldDAB|website=www.worlddab.org}}</ref> was rejected  by the government June 2015 after a negative consultation round which included the telecom authority (PTS).

In July 2010, the Government of the [[Republic of China]] announced plans for digital convergence by 2015. During the first stage of the program, from 2010 through 2012, a number of bills being formulated and sent to the legislature for review, including a radio and TV broadcast law. Taiwan has been a supporter of DAB and DAB+ broadcasting and planned for a full implementation of digital broadcasting (both TV and radio) by 2010. Lack of marketing, promotion and consumer awareness has slowed this digital expansion. The new laws being developed should set a firm timeline in place for digital conversion of all media and telecoms. DAB in Taiwan is solely operated by SuperFM on a trial basis. There are seven trial services available including one DMB.\n\nSuperFM broadcasts multiple foreign language programmes, for example in Vietnamese, Thai and Filipino aimed at foreign nationals living in Taiwan but who are unable to listen to their home nation's radio programmes via analogue radio.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.worlddab.org/country-information/chinese-taipei|title=Chinese Taipei &#124; Country Information &#124; WorldDAB|website=www.worlddab.org}}</ref>\n\n==Thailand==\nFollowing the successful licence auction for commercial digital TV channels in December 2013, the [[National Broadcasting and Telecommunications Commission]] (NBTC) is looking to auction about 4,000 similar licences for digital radio in early 2015.\n\nThe licences would be in the nationwide and region-wide categories. There are expected to about 20 nationwide licences. The auction will be held on a phase-by-phase basis.\n\nThe NBTC's broadcasting committee will sign a memorandum of understanding with MCOT, the Public Relations Department and the Royal Thai Army at the end of January 2014 to conduct a year-long trial of digital radio broadcasting.\n\nThe digital radio service will be provided on VHF (very high frequency) bands that will be returned to the NBTC by the state agencies that own existing analog TV concessions.\n\nThe existing analog AM and FM radio frequencies will be allocated for community and public radio. There are 525 AM and FM channels nationwide.\n\nThe estimated final price of a commercial digital radio licence would be around Bt100,000. About 10 licences to provide network services to the prospective digital radio operators will also be granted.\n\nThe first Thailand Broadcasting Master Plan (2012-2016) states strategies for digital terrestrial radio roll-out, roadmap and policy for digital terrestrial radio roll-out within two years, after the adoption of the Master Plan.\nDAB+ demonstrations started in Bangkok on 1 March 2013.

Two transmitters will operate as a single frequency network, with one transmitting a 10&nbsp;kW signal. This test mode is scheduled to last a year, with the possibility of an extension in to 2015. The twelve radio stations which will take part in the trial are being selected. Unlike earlier trials, consumers will receive more information on this new way of radio consumption and there will be a large volume of digital radios available in consumer electronic shops.\n\nAustria is committed to a digital radio future and a report by the regulators, the Austrian Communications Authority (KommAustria) and RTR-GmbH recommended DAB+ in Band III as the way forward. As planned, KommAustria completed a call for interest regarding DAB+ in August 2012. KommAustria intended to launch DAB+ by an open call for tender regarding the DAB+ network if enough parties showed believable and sustainable interest. A minimum limit of 12 possible programs (to fill one MUX coverage) was set. Unfortunately this limit was not reached as too few parties showed interest or failed to meet the criteria of the call for interest. Most remarkably, the public broadcaster ORF and the bigger players in the Austrian market did not show interest but strongly voiced their opposition against the launch of DAB+ in Austria. However, there is a group of broadcasters who are very outspoken in favour of DAB+, but the majority of radio stations remain unsure. The public broadcaster ORF has renewed its objection to any DAB+ plans. In the upcoming \"Digitalisation Concept\" which marks the authority's official strategy and schedule for the digitalisation of broadcasting, KommAustria plans to elaborate on the technical details of a possible DAB+ network. There will be no further calls for interest but the possibility for a call for tender upon request. Nevertheless, a working group that was created in 2009 to consider the countries digital future is still at work. Its members are stakeholders from the Austrian radio market who represent opponents and proponents of digital radio. It consists of the regulatory authority, the public broadcaster ORF, the commercial and non-commercial broadcasters associations, the electronic industry and consumer associations. The group is constantly watching and evaluating the progress of digital radio in other European countries. The success of digital radio in Germany will affect whether Austria decides to implement DAB+.\n\nThe Austrian Association of the Electrical and Electronic Industry (FEEI), and Austrian radio stations such as Radio Arabella and LoungeFM have founded the digital radio club, Digital Radio Austria. The aim of the new organisation is the promotion and development of digital radio in Austria, developing the media category \"Radio\" in the digital media world, the establishment of radio on new platforms and to promote the provision of information and support for education and training in the field of electronic and new media.\n<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.worlddab.org/country-information/austria|title=Austria &#124; Country Information &#124; WorldDAB|website=www.worlddab.org}}</ref>\n\n==Belgium==\n===French (Wallonia and Brussels)===\n\nThe [[Radio T\u00e9l\u00e9vision Belge de la Communaut\u00e9 Fran\u00e7aise]] (RTBF) is the public broadcaster for the [[French Community of Belgium|Belgian French speaking community]]. Since 1998, RTBF has operated one DAB multiplex simulcasting its five FM radio stations and two [[Belgischer Rundfunk|BRF]] (the [[German-speaking Community of Belgium|Belgian German speaking]] public broadcaster) FM radio stations, covering of Brussels and Wallonia. On this multiplex, RTBF is also testing four DAB+ audio and data channels (indifferent bit rates and with slideshows) for itself and also for the private radio stations. The aim is to plan a roadmap for DAB+ in French speaking Belgium together with the private broadcasters, subject to approval from the French Community Government and the regulator, the [[Conseil Sup\u00e9rieur de l\u2019Audiovisuel]] (CSA). In Spring 2011 a common vision of the main broadcasters, both private and public, was defined with a four-tier strategy for migration from analogue to digital radio (DAB+ broadcast; hybrid radio; single online radio player and radio on TV). In summer 2011 the Parliament of the French-speaking Community adopted unanimously a resolution asking the French-speaking Government to support the migration to digital radio from 2011 onwards.\n\nThe CSA (regulator) launched a public consultation about digital radio in autumn 2011 which provided positive feedback. In spring 2012, the CSA recommended to the Government a DAB+ rollout based mainly on two layers in Band III. In June 2012 the Government authorized RTBF to proceed with DAB+ trials for commercial and non-profit radio stations licensed by the CSA.\n\nThe next step is to achieve a public funding agreement to finance the investments needed for the technical DAB+ rollout, upgrade of the RTBF DAB network to DAB+ to ensure deep indoor coverage of Brussels and Wallonia, for a potential public launch in 2015 (to mark the 101st anniversary of the first radio broadcasting in Belgium). RTBF is testing Radio DNS interactive slideshows on its DAB+ channels.\n\n===Flemish (Flanders and Brussels)===\n\nThe [[Vlaamse Radio- en Televisieomroeporganisatie]] (VRT) is the public broadcaster for the Belgian Flemish Community. VRT has one DAB multiplex in operation with eight radio stations: the 5 FM-also stations Radio 1, Radio 2, Klara, Studio Brussel and MNM and three digital-only channels: Nieuws+ (news), Klara Continuo (non-stop classic and older music) and MNM Hits (Top 40).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vrt.be/nl/aanbod/kijk-en-luister/radio-luisteren/dab-|title=DAB+ &#124; VRT.be|website=www.vrt.be}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vrt.be/nl/heb-je-een-vraag/vragen-over-dab-|title=Vragen over DAB+ &#124; VRT.be|website=www.vrt.be}}</ref> Norkring, which operates VRT's multiplex, also has a license for another multiplex and is wording on a DAB+ roll out.

At the end of 2007, France's Government announced that the official standard for digital radio in France would be DMB-A, to be marketed as Radio Num\u00e9rique Terrestre (RNT).\n\nAt the end of 2013, the French Parliament will examine an update of the 1986 law about radio and television. Then the CSA should publish a timetable for a call for applications for tenders for digital terrestrial licenses for France's next 20 biggest cities which will add up to 62% coverage. An additional tender will also allow to add DAB+ services to the 14 multiplexes in Paris, Marseille and Nice, as well as five more multiplexes in these towns.\n\nIn April 2012 the CSA re-launched a call of tender for three cities (Paris for seven multiplexes, Marseille and Nice for six multiplexes each). The four main commercial radio groups decided do not bid and the government did not allow the public service (Radio France) to pre-empt frequencies. At the beginning of October 2012 the CSA published the candidates selected for the three cities. At the beginning of 2014, six multiplexes will be on air in Paris, four in Marseille and four in Nice.\n\nRoll out of terrestrial digital radio was scheduled to start in December 2009 but was postponed amid opposition from several sources, including private radio operators. The Prime Minister commissioned a further report by David Kessler, former chief executive France Culture, which was published in mid-2011 and suggested that the conditions had not been met for the full scale deployment of digital radio in France. The report suggested a moratorium of two to three years during which time the French market would look at\nthe deployment of digital radio in the rest of Europe. The report also stated that the government approved the CSA's decision to allow further trials to continue.\n\nThe CSA is responsible for taking the findings of the Kessler report forward and in order to do this set up an \u2018Observatory\u2019 which includes all of the industry players. The publication of the Kessler report meant the market could move forward after a period of stagnation and to this end various trials were put on-air (Paris, Nantes, Marseille and Lyon).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.worlddab.org/country-information/france|title=France &#124; Country Information &#124; WorldDAB|website=www.worlddab.org|access-date=29 April 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150220000457/https://www.worlddab.org/country-information/france|archive-date=20 February 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==Germany==\nBy the end of 2013 more than 120 national, regional and local programs will be broadcast in Germany. Also more than 90% of the German population can listen to at least one digital radio ensemble. This is considered to be a respectable success two years after the launch.\n\nDespite some changes in the national multiplex, the prospect for both commercial and public broadcasters is very positive as receiver sales are increasing. Furthermore, a stable ecosystem of private digital radio stations could be established in metropolitan areas such as Frankfurt, Berlin and Munich.\n\nThe current focus of broadcasters and network operators is to continue their marketing efforts in all media. For this reason the initiative \u2018Digitalradio Deutschland\u2019 was founded by the commercial broadcasters on the national multiplex (represented by DRD GmbH), the ARD group, Deutschlandradio and the network operator Media Broadcast. The goal is to coordinate the b2b and b2c marketing initiatives of all stakeholders to foster the evolution of digital radio in Germany by obtaining a reasonable market penetration by end of 2014.\n\nCoordination with the device industry is carried out via the initiative \u2018Digitalradio Deutschland\u2019, organised by the German Federal Ministry of Economics and Technology (BMWi). Five working groups were created to guide all areas of digital radio development and roll out, such as receiver/devices, data and traffic services, networks or advertisements.\n\nThe initiative hired consumer electronics market professionals which significantly improved the communication with the retailers. Many stores are now equipped with in-house-coverage solutions. The German car manufacturers offer DAB+ receivers for nearly all models either as an option or line fit. Two commercial telematics service providers use data capacity on the national mux to transmit TPEG based traffic information via DAB. The impressive coverage of Germany's highways over the last two years was secured through market collaboration and support for the technology.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.worlddab.org/country-information/germany|title=Germany &#124; Country Information &#124; WorldDAB|website=www.worlddab.org|access-date=29 April 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180724032907/https://www.worlddab.org/country-information/germany|archive-date=24 July 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==Ghana==\nOn 14 May 2008 FonTV, Africa's first mobile phone enabled television content service, was launched via DMB.

The conditions for the transition were:\n\n# Coverage (absolute condition for FM shutdown): Before 2015, the public broadcaster NRK must achieve coverage of 99.5%, the commercial broadcasters on the national network #1 are required to reach 90% of the population\n#Value added for the listeners (absolute condition for FM shutdown). There must be a value added for the listeners in going from FM to DAB, both in terms of available content and in terms of user experience.\n#Digital listening (condition to be met in order to shut down FM in 2017. Failure to reach it can postpone the shutdown until 2019). Before 2015 50% of the radio listeners must daily use a digital radio platform (currently this is 45%). This does not specify market share of listening, contrary to the UK requirement, only reach. \"Digital platform\" also includes listening via internet and via the digital TV network. This condition is set in order to measure the listeners' independence of the analogue FM-platform.\n#In-car solution (condition to be met in order to shut down FM in 2017. Failure to reach it can postpone the shutdown until 2019). Before 2015, there must be reasonably priced, well-functioning in-car adaptors on the market. In half of all Norwegian municipalities there must be an offer of in-car DAB-adaptor installation.\n\nAfter 2017, local stations, except for stations in major cities, will have the option to continue FM broadcasting.

On 1 November 2011, MediaCorp announced its DAB service would cease with effect from 1 December 2011.\n\nListeners could continue to receive MediaCorp radio through online streaming as well as mobile phone apps alongside the FM services in Singapore. Rediffusion Singapore launched its DAB service in July 2006. It was the first country in the world to introduce subscription based DAB+ digital radio service for the mass market. In April 2012, Rediffusion Singapore announced its service was under receivership and went off-air from 1 May 2012. Its branding and assets were brought over by Eduplus Holdings in June 2012.\n\nThere are no plans to turn on the DAB network in Singapore. Services are running via FM and online streaming.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.worlddab.org/country-information/singapore|title=Singapore &#124; Country Information &#124; WorldDAB|website=www.worlddab.org}}</ref>\n\n==Slovenia==\nRegular DAB+ transmission in Slovenia began on 19.

About half a million people, or 22.5% of the population, were potentially able to receive DAB transmissions.<ref name=\"auto1\"/> In January it was announced<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rtvslo.si/sporocila-za-javnost/rtv-slovenija-pridobila-frekvenco-za-dab-omrezje/384303|title=RTV Slovenija pridobila frekvenco za DAB omre\u017eje|website=RTVSLO.si}}</ref> that they have obtained a frequency allocation for a national network of DAB+ transmitters, covering 73% of Slovene households and 89% of highways and expressways. Test broadcasting on said frequency began on 2. September 2016 from Krvavec transmitter, shortly after that RTV Slovenia began nationwide regular transmission on 19. September 2016.\n\n==South Africa==\nThe Joint SADIBA/NAB Digital Radio DAB+ Trial Working group's application for a high\u2013powered DAB+ trial licence has been approved. The trial licence was granted to the South African Broadcasting Corporation (the applicant on behalf of the NAB radio members) by the regulator, the Independent Communications Authority of South Africa (ICASA). The trial will run from 1 April 2014 to 31 March 2015, and Sentech will be the signal distributor for the duration of the trial.\n\nThe SADIBA/NAB Working group is encouraged by the commitment of all stakeholders in putting digital radio firmly on the South African broadcasting agenda.\n\nThe South African DAB+ trial will consist of two high power transmitting stations (10&nbsp;kW transmitter power) 100&nbsp;kW ERP situated in Johannesburg and Pretoria in the province of Gauteng. The trial will operate as a SFN in VHF band III on Channel 13F on a frequency of 239.200&nbsp;MHz. This will happen after coverage verification at transmitter powers of 2&nbsp;kW, 5&nbsp;kW, and 10&nbsp;kW. The total area covered by the trial is 21185km2 and the total gross population covered is 10 705 387 (21.5% of total SA population). It is envisaged that between 18 and 20 radio from the Public, Commercial and Community sectors will participate in the trial. The trial will allow the testing of:\nEnd-to-end technical functionality\nExtent of portable mobile coverage\nSignal permeability\nDemonstrate digital radio services and value-added services\nPerformance in the field using typical consumer equipment and professional test and measurement equipment.\nThe effects of vehicle penetration loss, building penetration loss and clutter (e.g. buildings and vegetation) on coverage.\nTesting of the various encoding methods (stereo, para stereo, mono) for different audio types and at different bit rates to get a good understanding of what bit rates/encoding to use for the different program types.\nInvestigate the delivery of PAD within these tests, synchronisation with the audio and rate of change of the images.  \nIn July 2013 over 200 radio industry representatives came together at the South African Broadcasting Corporation's (SABC) facility in Johannesburg to attend a landmark workshop on the rollout of DAB+ digital radio and to discuss plans for a high-powered DAB+ trial transmission extending from Pretoria to Johannesburg by end 2013. The Independent Communications Authority of South Africa (ICASA), indicated that it stands ready to support broadcasting innovation in South Africa, which will be the first country to exploit opportunities for delivery of educational services via DAB+, as well as services for those with disabilities. Broadcasting radio via DAB+ will also allow ICASA to license new entrants where FM bandwidth is congested.\n\nMobileTV PTY performed technical tests of DMB (Digital Multimedia Broadcasting) and DAB+ in Gauteng from August 2011 until the end of July 2013 and plans to expand trials in South Africa. The prospective broadcaster will launch trials of DMB technology in the Free State and the Western Cape before the end of the 2013. In July 2012 they applied for a commercial license and expect to get an answer during 2013. ICASA has granted test licences for Cape and Bloemfontein, while assessing new applications for Port Eliazbeth, East London and Mpumalanga. MobileTV PTY aims to switch on the trials in Cape Town and Bloemfontein on 1 October and 1 November respectively. Their two transmitters will be relocated from Pretoria and Johannesburg Autumn 2013.\n\nMobileTV PTY ran two TV channels and one radio station on a test license. If a license is granted they would then cover 15-20 million of the 45 million people in South Africa and expand coverage in parallel to sales of devices and uptake of services. MobileTV PTY has teamed up with SABC, the public service broadcaster in South Africa. SABC reaches 76% of the population daily and is by far the biggest broadcaster and is partially financed by a TV license and partially by advertisements. MobileTV PTY is in dialogue with the Department of Education to evaluate whether the technology can be used for educational purposes, such as to reach rural schools and colleges in a cost-effective manner. The Department is primarily interested in the abilities of data transfer but an educational TV channel has not been ruled out. SABC will offer their 18 radio channels. MobileTV PTY wishes to also offer distribution for private radio stations following the launch.\n\nNo programmes are on air. Mobile TV PTY is awaiting a commercial license from the government. If licences are granted they will within the first year cover up to 50% of the population of South Africa, although they aim to increase this to between 80 and 90% within 2\u20133 years. Their plan is to broadcast 6-10 mobile TV channels and two radio stations. Additional services that combine broadcasting and the internet on the same device will be an essential part of their business model. Such services include traffic information, gambling, integration with social media and touch-screen shopping.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.worlddab.org/country-information/south-africa|title=South Africa &#124; Country Information &#124; WorldDAB|website=www.worlddab.org}}</ref>\n\n==South Korea==\nAs the first country to commercially launch mobile TV, South Korea is the most successful DMB market in the world. More than 62 million DMB enabled devices have been sold, of which the most popular are mobile phones. This number is expected to rise even more with an increase in coverage; services already cover over 80% of the country. Hundreds of DMB devices are available in this market and usage of mobile TV increases year on year. Interactive services are also growing in popularity adding value to broadcasting services.\n\nThe Korean government has set up a digital audio project to recommend a digital audio broadcasting standard for Korea.  Following ETRI's investigation of various digital radio platforms, a major decision is expected regarding the adoption of a digital radio technology for South Korean broadcasters.\n\nKorea's latest innovation is an interactive mobile TV service, or Smart DMB, launched in May 2011 with six terrestrial-DMB operators (T-DMB). With Smart DMB, mobile TV viewers are able to search the internet, receive EPG information updates, and even enjoy \u2018TV Screen Capture and Share Service\u2019 through SNS while watching television. Moreover, hybrid DMB was launched in Aug 2013 for the high quality video service.\n\nA DAB+ trial has been on air in Seoul since December 2013.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.worlddab.org/country-information/south-korea|title=South Korea &#124; Country Information &#124; WorldDAB|website=www.worlddab.org|access-date=29 April 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170710122752/https://www.worlddab.org/country-information/south-korea|archive-date=10 July 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==Spain==\nA total of 18 DAB audio services are on air. Population coverage is currently 20%. The Spanish DAB Association ([http://www.radiodigitaldab.com/index.htm Asociaci\u00f3n Foro de la Radio Digital]) comprising both national private and public broadcasters, is responsible for DAB/DAB+ in Spain.\n\nSpain first began broadcasting terrestrial digital radio in April 1998 covering Madrid, Barcelona and Valencia. From 2002 to June 2011, 23 transmitters covered the 52% of the Spanish population through three national multiplexes (1 SFN and 2 MFN). In addition, in some Comunidades Aut\u00f3nomas, DAB services were launched on additional regional multiplexes, but  they are currently switched off.\n\nThe Council of Ministers reached an agreement on Digital Radio in June 2011 and approved a Digitalisation Plan for Terrestrial Broadcasting with the following measures:\n\n#Reduction of DAB coverage from 52% to 20%, in order to facilitate a migration to DAB+\n#Flexibility for the broadcasters, in order to allow for  migration to DAB+\n#Study of a possible reassignment of the multiplexes\n#Promotional activities through the Spanish DAB Forum\n#DAB+ trials\n#A study of the necessary conditions to determine the date of  a possible analogue switch off<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.worlddab.org/country-information/spain|title=Spain &#124; Country Information &#124; WorldDAB|website=www.worlddab.org}}</ref>\n\n==Sweden==\nDAB transmissions in Sweden started on 27 September 1995 and today the coverage (MUX1) is 35% of the population with services from public service broadcaster Swedish Radio (SR). The license under which SR operates is valid until 31 December 2019.\n\nDuring the years several propositions have been put forward to the Parliament suggesting a larger digital radio network roll-out for public service broadcaster SR. This is seen as the first step to a switchover from analogue FM to digital DAB/DAB+.\n\nIn 2009, trial transmissions of DAB+ started and the coverage (MUX 2) quickly reached 22% of the population with 16 services from public service radio, commercial radio and community local radio.\n\nIn 2010, the Radio and TV Act came into effect which, for the first time, allowed commercial radio companies to apply for digital licenses. This paved the way for a radio industry united behind DAB+, something for which both public and commercial services have been lobbying for. At the same time, the Swedish Government allocated spectrum for a total of four nationwide multiplexers in VHF band III to digital radio DAB/DAB+. Two multiplexers are reserved for SR and two multiplexers are reserved for commercial radio. Three of the multiplexers are regionally MFNs and one multiplexer is a nationwide SFN on channel 12B.\n\nIn 2012, the license regulator (MRTV) started the license process for commercial digital radio. All major commercial broadcasters, representing 91% of all listening not counting SR, applied for a total of 22 audio programme licenses spread over 2 commercial multiplexers.\n\nIn 2013, the Government appointed a Digital radio Industry Coordinator to put forward a Digital Switchover (DSO) plan at the latest in November 2014 after consultation with SR and the commercial radio broadcasters. The purpose of this plan is to put forward a proposition on DSO for a decision by the Swedish Parliament.\n \t\nIn 2014 the radio industry saw the commercial licenses issued. However the Switchover Plan put forward by the Digital Radio Industry Coordinator.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.worlddab.org/country-information/sweden|title=Sweden &#124; Country Information &#124; WorldDAB|website=www.worlddab.org}}</ref> was rejected  by the government June 2015 after a negative consultation round which included the telecom authority (PTS). The government also received serious objections by the National Audit Office. The rejection of the DSO plan was finally confirmed by a unanimous vote in the Parliament February 3, 2016.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.regeringen.se/rattsliga-dokument/skrivelse/2015/10/skr.-20151625/|title=Riksrevisionens rapport om digitalradio|first=Regeringen och|last=Regeringskansliet|date=14 October 2015|website=Regeringskansliet}}</ref><ref>Riksrevisionens rapport om digitalradio, (RiR 2015:5)</ref>\n\n==Switzerland==\nThe Federal Office of Communications awarded a radio licence to the Digris AG company for the operation of DAB+ islands throughout Switzerland.\n\nToday there is one national (with four regional multiplexes for the four different languages) two regional and one local multiplexes, covering the German, French and Italian speaking areas of the country, with a mix of public and commercial services. In the middle of October 2012 the standard DAB was switched to the standard DAB+. Two to three programs per region will remain on simulcast service DAB/DAB+ until 2015.\n\nThe original four multiplexes are run by the public broadcaster SRG SSR, the first commercial DAB+ multiplex which was launched on 13 October 2009 now broadcasts 14 commercial radio stations in the German-speaking part of Switzerland. A second local commercial DAB+ multiplex started in December 2012 in the German-speaking part with six commercial radio- and three public radio stations and a first regional commercial DAB+ multiplex in the French-speaking part will start at the end of 2013.\n\nSwitzerland first launched DAB digital radio services in 1999 when the public broadcaster, SRG SSR went on air.

In July 2010, the Government of the [[Republic of China]] announced plans for digital convergence by 2015. During the first stage of the program, from 2010 through 2012, a number of bills being formulated and sent to the legislature for review, including a radio and TV broadcast law. Taiwan has been a supporter of DAB and DAB+ broadcasting and planned for a full implementation of digital broadcasting (both TV and radio) by 2010. Lack of marketing, promotion and consumer awareness has slowed this digital expansion. The new laws being developed should set a firm timeline in place for digital conversion of all media and telecoms. DAB in Taiwan is solely operated by SuperFM on a trial basis. There are seven trial services available including one DMB.\n\nSuperFM broadcasts multiple foreign language programmes, for example in Vietnamese, Thai and Filipino aimed at foreign nationals living in Taiwan but who are unable to listen to their home nation's radio programmes via analogue radio.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.worlddab.org/country-information/chinese-taipei|title=Chinese Taipei &#124; Country Information &#124; WorldDAB|website=www.worlddab.org}}</ref>\n\n==Thailand==\nFollowing the successful licence auction for commercial digital TV channels in December 2013, the [[National Broadcasting and Telecommunications Commission]] (NBTC) is looking to auction about 4,000 similar licences for digital radio in early 2015.\n\nThe licences would be in the nationwide and region-wide categories. There are expected to about 20 nationwide licences. The auction will be held on a phase-by-phase basis.\n\nThe NBTC's broadcasting committee will sign a memorandum of understanding with MCOT, the Public Relations Department and the Royal Thai Army at the end of January 2014 to conduct a year-long trial of digital radio broadcasting.\n\nThe digital radio service will be provided on VHF (very high frequency) bands that will be returned to the NBTC by the state agencies that own existing analog TV concessions.\n\nThe existing analog AM and FM radio frequencies will be allocated for community and public radio. There are 525 AM and FM channels nationwide.\n\nThe estimated final price of a commercial digital radio licence would be around Bt100,000. About 10 licences to provide network services to the prospective digital radio operators will also be granted.\n\nThe first Thailand Broadcasting Master Plan (2012-2016) states strategies for digital terrestrial radio roll-out, roadmap and policy for digital terrestrial radio roll-out within two years, after the adoption of the Master Plan.\nDAB+ demonstrations started in Bangkok on 1 March 2013. The International Telecommunication Union (ITU) and the National Broadcasting and Telecommunications Commission (NBTC), jointly organised the \"NBTC/ITU Workshop on Digital Radio Technologies\" held in Bangkok, Thailand, 1\u20133 March 2013. The Workshop was supported by WorldDMB, MCOT Public Co., LTd., the Government Public Relations Department, and the Royal Thai Army Radio and Television Station.\n\nNBTC is in the process of developing a policy document for digital radio services that will be published in 2014.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.worlddab.org/country-information/thailand|title=Thailand &#124; Country Information &#124; WorldDAB|website=www.worlddab.org}}</ref>\n\n==Turkey==\nTRT, the Turkish Broadcasting Corporation, has aired DAB test transmissions broadcasting four simulcast services in Band III and covering the capital, Ankara.

According to the HOPL online database of languages,<ref>In HOPL (History of Programming Languages), advanced search finds languages by country.</ref> out of the 8,500+ programming languages recorded, roughly 2,400 of them were developed in the [[United States]]<!-- I searched for all US entries, then counted pages, multiplied by entries per page -->, 600 in the [[United Kingdom]], 160 in [[Canada]], and 75 in [[Australia]].\n\nThus, over a third of all programming languages have been developed in countries where English is the primary language. This does not take into account the usage share of each language, situations where a language was developed in a non-English-speaking country but used English to appeal to an international audience (see the case of [[Python (programming language)|Python]] from the [[Netherlands]], [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]] from [[Japan]], and [[Lua (programming language)|Lua]] from [[Brazil]]), and situations where it was based on another language which used English.\n\n== International programming languages ==\nThe concept of international style programming languages was inspired by the work of British [[computer scientist]]s [[Christopher Strachey]], [[Peter Landin]], and others. It represents a class of languages of which the line of the algorithmic languages [[ALGOL]] was exemplary.\n\n[[ALGOL 68]]'s standard document was published in numerous [[natural languages]]. The standard allowed the internationalization of the programming language. On December 20, 1968, the \"Final Report\" (MR 101) was adopted by the Working Group, then subsequently approved by the General Assembly of [[UNESCO]]'s [[IFIP]] for publication. Translations of the standard were made for [[Russian language|Russian]], [[German language|German]], [[French language|French]], [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]], and then later [[Japanese language|Japanese]].

According to the HOPL online database of languages,<ref>In HOPL (History of Programming Languages), advanced search finds languages by country.</ref> out of the 8,500+ programming languages recorded, roughly 2,400 of them were developed in the [[United States]]<!-- I searched for all US entries, then counted pages, multiplied by entries per page -->, 600 in the [[United Kingdom]], 160 in [[Canada]], and 75 in [[Australia]].\n\nThus, over a third of all programming languages have been developed in countries where English is the primary language. This does not take into account the usage share of each language, situations where a language was developed in a non-English-speaking country but used English to appeal to an international audience (see the case of [[Python (programming language)|Python]] from the [[Netherlands]], [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]] from [[Japan]], and [[Lua (programming language)|Lua]] from [[Brazil]]), and situations where it was based on another language which used English.\n\n== International programming languages ==\nThe concept of international style programming languages was inspired by the work of British [[computer scientist]]s [[Christopher Strachey]], [[Peter Landin]], and others. It represents a class of languages of which the line of the algorithmic languages [[ALGOL]] was exemplary.\n\n[[ALGOL 68]]'s standard document was published in numerous [[natural languages]]. The standard allowed the internationalization of the programming language. On December 20, 1968, the \"Final Report\" (MR 101) was adopted by the Working Group, then subsequently approved by the General Assembly of [[UNESCO]]'s [[IFIP]] for publication. Translations of the standard were made for [[Russian language|Russian]], [[German language|German]], [[French language|French]], [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]], and then later [[Japanese language|Japanese]]. The standard was available also in [[Braille]].

The inciting event is yet to be elucidated but may be a viral agent, [[oxidative stress]] or autoimmune. [[Endothelial cell]] damage and [[apoptosis]] ensue, leading to the vascular leakiness that manifests in early clinical stages as tissue [[oedema]]. At this stage it is predominantly a [[Th1 cell|Th1]] and [[Th17]]-mediated disease. \n* After this the vasculature is further compromised by impaired [[angiogenesis]] and impaired [[vasculogenesis]] (fewer endothelial progenitor cells), likely related to the presence of antiendothelinal cell antibodies (AECA). Despite this impaired [[angiogenesis]], elevated levels of pro-angiogenic growth factors like [[platelet derived growth factor|PDGF]] and [[vascular endothelial growth factor|VEGF]] is often seen in persons with the condition. The balance of [[vasodilation]] and vasoconstriction becomes off-balance and the net result is vasoconstriction. The damaged endothelium then serves as a point of origin for blood clot formation and further contributes to [[ischaemia]]-[[reperfusion injury]] and the generation of [[reactive oxygen species]]. These later stages are characterised by [[Th2]] polarity. \n* The damaged endothelium upregulates [[adhesion molecules]] and [[chemokine]]s to attract [[leucocyte]]s, which enables the development of innate and adaptive immune responses, including loss of tolerance to various oxidised [[antigens]], which includes [[topoisomerase I]]. [[B cells]] mature into [[plasma cells]], which furthers the autoimmune component of the condition. [[T cells]] differentiate into subsets, including Th2 cells, which play a vital role in tissue [[fibrosis]]. [[Topoisomerase 1|Anti\u2013topoisomerase 1]] [[antibodies]], in turn, stimulate [[type I interferon]] production.\n* [[Fibroblast]]s are recruited and activated by multiple [[cytokine]]s and growth factors to generate [[myofibroblasts]]. Dysregulated [[transforming growth factor \u03b2]] (TGF-\u03b2) signalling in fibroblasts and myofibroblasts has been observed in multiple studies of scleroderma-affected individuals. Activation of fibroblasts and myofibroblasts leads to excessive deposition of collagen and other related proteins, leading to fibrosis. B cells are implicated in this stage, [[interleukin 6|IL-6]] and TGF-\u03b2 produced by the B cells decrease collagen degradation and increase [[extracellular matrix]] production.

The damaged endothelium then serves as a point of origin for blood clot formation and further contributes to [[ischaemia]]-[[reperfusion injury]] and the generation of [[reactive oxygen species]]. These later stages are characterised by [[Th2]] polarity. \n* The damaged endothelium upregulates [[adhesion molecules]] and [[chemokine]]s to attract [[leucocyte]]s, which enables the development of innate and adaptive immune responses, including loss of tolerance to various oxidised [[antigens]], which includes [[topoisomerase I]]. [[B cells]] mature into [[plasma cells]], which furthers the autoimmune component of the condition. [[T cells]] differentiate into subsets, including Th2 cells, which play a vital role in tissue [[fibrosis]]. [[Topoisomerase 1|Anti\u2013topoisomerase 1]] [[antibodies]], in turn, stimulate [[type I interferon]] production.\n* [[Fibroblast]]s are recruited and activated by multiple [[cytokine]]s and growth factors to generate [[myofibroblasts]]. Dysregulated [[transforming growth factor \u03b2]] (TGF-\u03b2) signalling in fibroblasts and myofibroblasts has been observed in multiple studies of scleroderma-affected individuals. Activation of fibroblasts and myofibroblasts leads to excessive deposition of collagen and other related proteins, leading to fibrosis. B cells are implicated in this stage, [[interleukin 6|IL-6]] and TGF-\u03b2 produced by the B cells decrease collagen degradation and increase [[extracellular matrix]] production. [[Endothelin|Endothelin signalling]] is implicated in the pathophysiology of fibrosis.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Leask A | title = The role of endothelin-1 signaling in the fibrosis observed in systemic sclerosis | journal = Pharmacological Research | volume = 63 | issue = 6 | pages = 502\u20133 | date = June 2011 | pmid = 21315153 | doi = 10.1016/j.phrs.2011.01.011 }}</ref>\n\n[[Vitamin D]] is implicated in the pathophysiology of the disease.
