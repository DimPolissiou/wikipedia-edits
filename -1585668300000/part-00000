His father, who spoke sixteen languages and embraced travel as the only means of prolonging life, yet died in his forties, had prematurely abandoned a career in the Austrian diplomatic service that took him to [[Athens]], [[Constantinople]], [[Rio de Janeiro]] and Tokyo, to devote himself to study and writing.\n\nCoudenhove-Kalergi's parents met when his mother helped the Austro-Hungarian diplomat after he fell off a horse while riding in [[Empire of Japan|Japan]]. In commenting on their union, [[Whittaker Chambers]] described the future originator of Pan-Europe as \"practically a Pan-European organization himself.\" He elaborated: \"The [[Coudenhove]]s were a wealthy [[Flemish people|Flemish]] family that fled to Austria during the [[French Revolution]]. The [[Kallergis family|Kalergis]] were a wealthy Greek family from [[Crete]].

His father personally taught his two sons Russian and Hungarian and toughened them both physically and morally.

He also took them to [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] every Sunday.

His marriage to a [[divorcee|divorc\u00e9e]] thirteen years his senior, and a [[commoner]], caused a temporary split with his family.

His intellectual influences ranged from [[Immanuel Kant]], [[Rudolf Kjell\u00e9n]] and [[Oswald Spengler]] to [[Arthur Schopenhauer]] and [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]. In politics, he was an enthusiastic supporter of \"[[fourteen points]]\" made by [[Woodrow Wilson]] on 8 January 1918 and [[pacifism|pacifist]] initiatives of [[Kurt Hiller]].

Warburg remained sincerely interested in the movement for the remainder of his life and served as an intermediate for Coudenhove-Kalergi with influential Americans such as banker [[Paul Warburg]] and financier [[Bernard Baruch]]. In April 1924, Coudenhove-Kalergi founded the journal ''Paneuropa'' (1924\u20131938) of which he was editor and principal author. The next year he started publishing his main work, the ''Kampf um Paneuropa '' (The fight for Paneuropa, 1925\u20131928, three volumes). In 1926, the first Congress of the Pan-European Union was held in Vienna and the 2,000 delegates elected Coudenhove-Kalergi as president of the Central Council, a position he held until his death in 1972.\n\nHis original vision was for a world divided into only five states: a United States of Europe that would link continental countries with French and Italian possessions in Africa; a Pan-American Union encompassing North and South Americas; the British Commonwealth circling the globe; the USSR spanning Eurasia; and a Pan-Asian Union whereby Japan and China would control most of the Pacific. To him, the only hope for a Europe devastated by war was to federate along lines that the Hungarian-born Romanian [[Aurel Popovici]] and others had proposed for the dissolved multinational Empire of Austria-Hungary. According to Coudenhove-Kalergi, Pan-Europe would encompass and extend a more flexible and more competitive Austria-Hungary, with English serving as the world language, spoken by everyone in addition to their native tongue. He believed that individualism and socialism would learn to cooperate instead of compete, and urged that capitalism and communism cross-fertilise each other just as the Protestant Reformation had spurred the Catholic Church to regenerate itself.<ref>{{harvnb|Lipgens|1984|p=712}}; {{harvnb|Johnston|1983|pp=320\u2013321}}</ref>\n\nCoudenhove-Kalergi attempted to enlist prominent European politicians in his pan-European cause. He offered the presidency of the Austrian branch of the Pan-European Union to [[Ignaz Seipel]], who accepted the offer unhesitatingly and rewarded his beneficiary with an office in the old Imperial palace in Vienna. Coudenhove-Kalergi had less success with [[Tom\u00e1\u0161 Garrigue Masaryk|Tom\u00e1\u0161 Masaryk]], who referred him to his uncooperative Prime Minister [[Edvard Bene\u0161]]. However, the idea of pan-Europe elicited support from politicians as diverse as the Italian anti-Fascist politician [[Carlo Sforza]] and the German President of the [[Reichsbank]] under [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]], [[Hjalmar Schacht]]. Although Coudenhove-Kalergi found himself unable to sway [[Benito Mussolini]], his ideas influenced [[Aristide Briand]] through his inspired speech in favour of a European Union in the [[League of Nations]] on 8 September 1929, as well as his famous 1930 \"Memorandum on the Organisation of a Regime of European Federal Union.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Weigall|Stirk|1992|pp=11\u201315}}</ref>\n\nCoudenhove-Kalergi proposed Beethoven's \"Ode to Joy\" as the [[Anthem of Europe]] in 1929,<ref name=\"Paneurope Suisse\" /> which he later proposed in 1955 as Anthem for the [[European Union]].

Speaking at the first EPU conference, Coudenhove-Kalergi argued that the constitution of a wide market with a stable currency was the vehicle for Europe to reconstruct its potential and take the place it deserves within the concert of Nations.

He advocated Austrian involvement in world politics in order to keep the peace, as \"active neutrality\". He continued his advocacy of European unification in memoranda circulated to the governments of the Federal Republic of Germany, France, the United Kingdom, and Italy.

In his youth, the elder Coudenhove-Kalergi was an [[antisemitism|antisemite]]. He had expected to confirm his antipathy towards the Jews when he started working on his treatise ''Das Wesen des Antisemitismus'' (''The Essence of Antisemitism''); but, Coudenhove-Kalergi came to a different conclusion by the time he published his book in 1901. Following an [[irony|ironic]] critique of the new racial theories, he declared that the essence of antisemitism amounted to nothing more credible than fanatical religious hatred. He traced that fanaticism to religious bigotry that originated in the promulgation of [[Torah]] under [[Ezra]]. According to the elder Coudenhove-Kalergi, Jewish religious bigotry provoked opposition from the relatively tolerant Greco-Roman [[polytheism|polytheists]], eliciting their anti-Judaic reaction. Heinrich Coudenhove-Kalergi credited the Jews with originating religious intolerance, and condemned it as a violation of genuine religious principles. He branded every sort of anti-Judaism unchristian. He further urged liberal Christians and Jews to ally in protecting both of their religions, and religion as such, against the emerging menace of [[secularism]].<ref>{{harvnb|Langmuir}}, [https://archive.org/details/historyreligiona0000lang/page/22 pp. 22\u201324]; {{harvnb|Johnston|1983|pp=320\u2013321}}</ref>\n\nDespite his opposition to simplistic racial theory, Heinrich Coudenhove-Kalergi agreed that Jews are racially distinct. Although he pointed out that there is no Semitic race, because Semitic is an ethno-linguistic group, he equivocated by also remarking that the charges that Semites were uncreative were belied by civilizations formed by the [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]] and [[Babylonians]], who spoke [[Semitic languages]].

Warburg remained sincerely interested in the movement for the remainder of his life and served as an intermediate for Coudenhove-Kalergi with influential Americans such as banker [[Paul Warburg]] and financier [[Bernard Baruch]]. In April 1924, Coudenhove-Kalergi founded the journal ''Paneuropa'' (1924\u20131938) of which he was editor and principal author. The next year he started publishing his main work, the ''Kampf um Paneuropa '' (The fight for Paneuropa, 1925\u20131928, three volumes). In 1926, the first Congress of the Pan-European Union was held in Vienna and the 2,000 delegates elected Coudenhove-Kalergi as president of the Central Council, a position he held until his death in 1972.\n\nHis original vision was for a world divided into only five states: a United States of Europe that would link continental countries with French and Italian possessions in Africa; a Pan-American Union encompassing North and South Americas; the British Commonwealth circling the globe; the USSR spanning Eurasia; and a Pan-Asian Union whereby Japan and China would control most of the Pacific. To him, the only hope for a Europe devastated by war was to federate along lines that the Hungarian-born Romanian [[Aurel Popovici]] and others had proposed for the dissolved multinational Empire of Austria-Hungary. According to Coudenhove-Kalergi, Pan-Europe would encompass and extend a more flexible and more competitive Austria-Hungary, with English serving as the world language, spoken by everyone in addition to their native tongue. He believed that individualism and socialism would learn to cooperate instead of compete, and urged that capitalism and communism cross-fertilise each other just as the Protestant Reformation had spurred the Catholic Church to regenerate itself.<ref>{{harvnb|Lipgens|1984|p=712}}; {{harvnb|Johnston|1983|pp=320\u2013321}}</ref>\n\nCoudenhove-Kalergi attempted to enlist prominent European politicians in his pan-European cause. He offered the presidency of the Austrian branch of the Pan-European Union to [[Ignaz Seipel]], who accepted the offer unhesitatingly and rewarded his beneficiary with an office in the old Imperial palace in Vienna. Coudenhove-Kalergi had less success with [[Tom\u00e1\u0161 Garrigue Masaryk|Tom\u00e1\u0161 Masaryk]], who referred him to his uncooperative Prime Minister [[Edvard Bene\u0161]]. However, the idea of pan-Europe elicited support from politicians as diverse as the Italian anti-Fascist politician [[Carlo Sforza]] and the German President of the [[Reichsbank]] under [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]], [[Hjalmar Schacht]]. Although Coudenhove-Kalergi found himself unable to sway [[Benito Mussolini]], his ideas influenced [[Aristide Briand]] through his inspired speech in favour of a European Union in the [[League of Nations]] on 8 September 1929, as well as his famous 1930 \"Memorandum on the Organisation of a Regime of European Federal Union.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Weigall|Stirk|1992|pp=11\u201315}}</ref>\n\nCoudenhove-Kalergi proposed Beethoven's \"Ode to Joy\" as the [[Anthem of Europe]] in 1929,<ref name=\"Paneurope Suisse\" /> which he later proposed in 1955 as Anthem for the [[European Union]].

Coudenhove-Kalergi was appointed the honorary chairman of the fraternal youth association that Hatoyama, with the influence of his book, had established in 1953.\n\nIn 1955, he proposed the [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]]'s \"[[Ode to Joy]]\" as the music for the [[European Anthem]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.coe.int/t/dgal/dit/ilcd/Historical_Content/hymn/kalergi1.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081108214702/http://www.coe.int/t/dgal/dit/ilcd/Historical_Content/hymn/kalergi1.pdf |archivedate=8 November 2008 |title=Union Paneurop\u00e9enne |date=3 August 1955|language= French}} ([http://www.cvce.eu/en/obj/exchange_of_letters_between_richard_coudenhove_kalergi_and_paul_m_g_levy_3_august_1955_to_5_september_1955-en-34a3b196-9a23-4e9e-a977-94e31495b169.html digital document] by [[Centre virtuel de la connaissance sur l'Europe|CVCE]])</ref> a suggestion that the [[Council of Europe]] took up 16 years later.\n\nIn the 1960s, Coudenhove-Kalergi urged Austria to pursue \"an active policy of peace\", as a \"fight against the [[Cold War]] and its continuation, the atomic war\". He advocated Austrian involvement in world politics in order to keep the peace, as \"active neutrality\". He continued his advocacy of European unification in memoranda circulated to the governments of the Federal Republic of Germany, France, the United Kingdom, and Italy. He recommended negotiations between the [[European Community]] and the [[European Free Trade Association]] towards forming a \"European customs union\" that would be free of political and military connections, but would eventually adopt a monetary union.\n\n== Views on race and religion ==\nIn his attitudes towards race and religion, Coudenhove-Kalergi continued the work of his father. In his youth, the elder Coudenhove-Kalergi was an [[antisemitism|antisemite]]. He had expected to confirm his antipathy towards the Jews when he started working on his treatise ''Das Wesen des Antisemitismus'' (''The Essence of Antisemitism''); but, Coudenhove-Kalergi came to a different conclusion by the time he published his book in 1901. Following an [[irony|ironic]] critique of the new racial theories, he declared that the essence of antisemitism amounted to nothing more credible than fanatical religious hatred. He traced that fanaticism to religious bigotry that originated in the promulgation of [[Torah]] under [[Ezra]]. According to the elder Coudenhove-Kalergi, Jewish religious bigotry provoked opposition from the relatively tolerant Greco-Roman [[polytheism|polytheists]], eliciting their anti-Judaic reaction. Heinrich Coudenhove-Kalergi credited the Jews with originating religious intolerance, and condemned it as a violation of genuine religious principles. He branded every sort of anti-Judaism unchristian. He further urged liberal Christians and Jews to ally in protecting both of their religions, and religion as such, against the emerging menace of [[secularism]].<ref>{{harvnb|Langmuir}}, [https://archive.org/details/historyreligiona0000lang/page/22 pp. 22\u201324]; {{harvnb|Johnston|1983|pp=320\u2013321}}</ref>\n\nDespite his opposition to simplistic racial theory, Heinrich Coudenhove-Kalergi agreed that Jews are racially distinct. Although he pointed out that there is no Semitic race, because Semitic is an ethno-linguistic group, he equivocated by also remarking that the charges that Semites were uncreative were belied by civilizations formed by the [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]] and [[Babylonians]], who spoke [[Semitic languages]]. He further sought to defend the Jews against charges of parasitic greed and cowardice with anecdotal counterexamples of Jewish industriousness and martial courage.<ref>{{harvnb|Robertson|1999|pp=198\u2013199}}</ref>\n\nIn an interview in the first Pan-European Congress in 1926, Richard Coudenhove-Kalergi expressed the support of Jews by the Pan-European movement and the benefits to Jews with the elimination of racial hatred and economic rivalry brought by the United States of Europe.<ref>{{citation |date= 5 October 1926|title= Jews Participate in Pan-europe Congress Sessions in Vienna|publisher= [[Jewish Telegraphic Agency]]|url= http://www.jta.org/1926/10/05/archive/jews-participate-in-pan-europe-congress-sessions-in-vienna|accessdate= 5 November 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn 1932, Richard Coudenhove-Kalergi composed a preface for a new edition of his father's condemnation of antisemitism, reissued by his own publishing house. In 1933, he responded to the ascendance of [[Nazism]] by collaborating with [[Heinrich Mann]], [[Arthur Holitscher]], [[Lion Feuchtwanger]], and [[Max Brod]] in writing and publishing the pamphlet ''Gegen die Phrase vom j\u00fcdischen Sch\u00e4dling'' (Against the Phrase '[[Jewish parasite|Jewish Parasite]]').\n\n== Journeys to Japan ==\n=== First return to Japan ===\nThe Pan-European idea influenced a young Japanese diplomat \u2013 in the future, the president of [[Kajima Corporation]] \u2013 [[Morinosuke Kajima]] during his residence in Berlin in 1922.<ref name=\"Hirakawa\">{{harvnb|Hirakawa|2011|pp=40\u201342}}</ref> Coudenhove-Kalergi formed a friendship with Kajima and then asked him to translate the book ''Pan-Europa'' into Japanese.<ref name=\"Hirakawa\" /> He proposed Pan-Asia to Kajima and promised to give [[Dutch East Indies]] as their friendship after the realization of the task to establish Pan-Asia.<ref name=\"Hirakawa\" /> Kajima published ''Pan-Europa'' in Japanese in 1927.

He respected Coudenhove-Kalergi over a lifetime, dreaming of the realization of Pan-Asia.<ref name=\"Hirakawa\" />\n\nIn Japan, the Pan-European idea also influenced a journalist [[Yoshinori Maeda]], the president of [[NHK]].

The Japanese word {{nihongo|''y\u016bai''|[[wikt:\u53cb\u611b|\u53cb\u611b]]}} has several meanings but especially the word used by Hatoyama means ''fraternity'' and in German ''[[wikt:Br\u00fcderlichkeit|br\u00fcderlichkeit]]''.<ref>{{harvnb|Pempel|Lee|2012}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=umb2lVHU81IC&pg=PA137 p. 137]</ref> It can also be considered equivalent to \"[[Libert\u00e9, \u00e9galit\u00e9, fraternit\u00e9|Liberty, Equality, Fraternity]]\" (Brotherhood), the motto of the French Republic. An educator [[Kaoru Hatoyama]] became the second president of the association after her husband Ichir\u014d, the first president, died in 1959.\n\nIn 1967 Coudenhove-Kalergi was awarded the Kajima Peace Award, and was invited to Japan by Morinosuke Kajima as the president of Kajima Institute of International Peace, Yoshinori Maeda as the president of NHK, and Kaoru Hatoyama as the president of Yuai Youth Association.

R. Panthulu]]. The film stars [[Sivaji Ganesan]], [[Gemini Ganesan]], [[Padmini (actress)|Padmini]], [[S. Varalakshmi]], and [[Ragini (actress)|Ragini]], with [[V. K. Ramasamy (actor)|V. K. Ramasamy]] and [[Javar Seetharaman]] in supporting roles. Its soundtrack and score were composed by [[G. Ramanathan]].\n\nProduced and distributed by Panthulu under his banner Padmini Pictures, the film is loosely based on the story of [[Veerapandiya Kattabomman]], the 18th-century South Indian chieftain who rebelled against the [[East India Company]]. It was an adaptation of the play of the same name by [[Sakthi T. K. Krishnasamy]] which featured Sivaji Ganesan as the title character, and premiered in August 1957. [[Principal photography]] began in October the same year, and took place mainly in [[Jaipur]] and Madras (now [[Chennai]]) till late 1958. This was the first Tamil film released in [[Technicolor]].\n\n''Veerapandiya Kattabomman'' premiered in London on 10 May 1959, and was released in [[Tamil Nadu]] six days later. It was critically acclaimed; Sivaji Ganesan's performance as Kattabomman received widespread praise, although some film scholars considered elements in the film, particularly the portrayal of the title character, to be historically inaccurate. It was a commercial success, running for over 25 weeks in theatres and becoming a [[silver jubilee]] film. ''Veerapandiya Kattabomman'' was dubbed and released in [[Telugu language|Telugu]] as ''Veerapandiya Kattabrahmanna'' in the same year, and in [[Hindi]] as ''Amar Shaheed'' the following year.\n\nThe film was the first in Tamil cinema to receive international awards for Best Film, Best Actor, and Best Music Director at the 1960 Afro-Asian Film Festival in Cairo, and received a Certificate of Merit as part of the [[National Film Award for Best Feature Film in Tamil]]. ''Veerapandiya Kattabomman'' was re-released in 1984, and a digitally-restored version was released on 21 August 2015; both were commercially successful.\n\n== Plot ==\n[[Veerapandiya Kattabomman]], the [[Tribal chief|chieftain]] of [[Panchalankurichi]], is a brave warrior. On receiving news of a robbery in his territory, he and his retinue set out incognito to capture the robbers. When captured, the robbers confess that they had been hired by the [[British Raj|British]] to create unrest in Kattabomman's domain; the British had enticed the neighbouring chieftain, [[Ettappan]], to help them annexe Panchalankurichi.\n\nVellaiyammal, who lives in [[Chalakudy|Chayalkudi]], a village near Panchalankurichi, vows to marry the man who tames her pet bull. She brings her bull to Panchalankurichi for participating in a [[jallikattu]] game sponsored by Kattabomman. All those who attempt to tame the bull fail until Vellaiyathevan, Kattabomman's commander-in-chief, subdues the bull and wins Vellaiyammal's love. Kattabomman later learns of their love, and encourages them to marry.\n\nThe king receives a message from W. C. Jackson, the tax collector for [[Tirunelveli]], which demands a meeting with him at [[Ramanathapuram]] to discuss payment. Captain Davison, Kattabomman's British friend, advises him to see Jackson. Jackson, learning that Kattabomman has come with his troops, demands to meet him alone. At the meeting, Jackson insults him and orders him arrested. Surrounded by British troops, Kattabomman fights and escapes; however, his minister Thanapathi Sivasubramaniam Pillai is captured.\n\nSome time later, Pillai is released and brings news that Jackson has been sent back to England at Davison's recommendation. A British messenger sent to Kattabomman's court by Colonel S. R. Lushington, Tirunelveli's new revenue collector reports that Pillai and his men have looted their granaries and killed their men at [[Srivaikuntam]]. Pillai justifies his act, saying that he instructed his men to do it because of the famine in their kingdom. Ashamed of Pillai's action, Kattabomman accuses him of theft and murder. Pillai apologises and offers himself as a prisoner to the British, but Kattabomman refuses to hand him over; instead, he offers money to compensate for the looted rice. Lushington refuses the compensation and, with Major Bannerman's and Ettappan's help, incites the neighbouring rulers to attack Kattabomman. Bannerman is placed in charge of the British troops; he and Ettappan plan to attack Panchalankurichi when the people are attending a festival in Tiruchendur. Kattabomman's spy Sundaralingam informs the king, who prepares for war.\n\nOn the day of the battle, Vellaiyammal begs Vellaiyathevan not to go because she had a nightmare full of evil omens the previous night. Ignoring her entreaties, Vellaiyathevan sets out and is killed in the ensuing battle. When she learns of her husband's death, Vellaiyammal avenges him by killing the man who killed him. She finds Vellaiyathevan's body and, overcome by grief, falls dead across it. Bannerman's troops attack Panchalankurichi with heavy artillery, and Kattabomman's army suffers. The king, wounded in the neck, is saved by his brother [[Oomaithurai]]. Sensing that the fort cannot survive another cannon barrage, Kattabomman and Oomaithurai flee to the adjoining kingdom of [[Kovilpatti]]. Pillai, disguising himself as Kattabomman, decoys the British soldiers who are on the king's trail. From Kovilpatti, Kattabomman and Oomaithurai flee to [[Pudukkottai]]. Thondaimaan, the king of Pudukkottai, is ordered by the British to capture Kattabomman and Oomaithurai. Fearing the British, Thondaimaan captures them and hands them over. While Oomaithurai is jailed, Kattabomman is tried by the British and hanged.\n\n== Cast ==\n:''Note: Listing as per the film's opening credits.''<ref name=\"Credits\" />\n{{Col-begin|width=70%}}\n{{col-break|width=50%}}\n* [[Sivaji Ganesan]] as [[Veerapandiya Kattabomman|Kattabomman]]\n* [[Gemini Ganesan]] as Vellaiyadhevan\n* [[Padmini (actress)|Padmini]] as Vellaiyammal\n* [[S.

R. Panthulu]]. The film stars [[Sivaji Ganesan]], [[Gemini Ganesan]], [[Padmini (actress)|Padmini]], [[S. Varalakshmi]], and [[Ragini (actress)|Ragini]], with [[V. K. Ramasamy (actor)|V. K. Ramasamy]] and [[Javar Seetharaman]] in supporting roles. Its soundtrack and score were composed by [[G. Ramanathan]].\n\nProduced and distributed by Panthulu under his banner Padmini Pictures, the film is loosely based on the story of [[Veerapandiya Kattabomman]], the 18th-century South Indian chieftain who rebelled against the [[East India Company]]. It was an adaptation of the play of the same name by [[Sakthi T. K. Krishnasamy]] which featured Sivaji Ganesan as the title character, and premiered in August 1957. [[Principal photography]] began in October the same year, and took place mainly in [[Jaipur]] and Madras (now [[Chennai]]) till late 1958. This was the first Tamil film released in [[Technicolor]].\n\n''Veerapandiya Kattabomman'' premiered in London on 10 May 1959, and was released in [[Tamil Nadu]] six days later. It was critically acclaimed; Sivaji Ganesan's performance as Kattabomman received widespread praise, although some film scholars considered elements in the film, particularly the portrayal of the title character, to be historically inaccurate. It was a commercial success, running for over 25 weeks in theatres and becoming a [[silver jubilee]] film. ''Veerapandiya Kattabomman'' was dubbed and released in [[Telugu language|Telugu]] as ''Veerapandiya Kattabrahmanna'' in the same year, and in [[Hindi]] as ''Amar Shaheed'' the following year.\n\nThe film was the first in Tamil cinema to receive international awards for Best Film, Best Actor, and Best Music Director at the 1960 Afro-Asian Film Festival in Cairo, and received a Certificate of Merit as part of the [[National Film Award for Best Feature Film in Tamil]]. ''Veerapandiya Kattabomman'' was re-released in 1984, and a digitally-restored version was released on 21 August 2015; both were commercially successful.\n\n== Plot ==\n[[Veerapandiya Kattabomman]], the [[Tribal chief|chieftain]] of [[Panchalankurichi]], is a brave warrior. On receiving news of a robbery in his territory, he and his retinue set out incognito to capture the robbers. When captured, the robbers confess that they had been hired by the [[British Raj|British]] to create unrest in Kattabomman's domain; the British had enticed the neighbouring chieftain, [[Ettappan]], to help them annexe Panchalankurichi.\n\nVellaiyammal, who lives in [[Chalakudy|Chayalkudi]], a village near Panchalankurichi, vows to marry the man who tames her pet bull. She brings her bull to Panchalankurichi for participating in a [[jallikattu]] game sponsored by Kattabomman. All those who attempt to tame the bull fail until Vellaiyathevan, Kattabomman's commander-in-chief, subdues the bull and wins Vellaiyammal's love. Kattabomman later learns of their love, and encourages them to marry.\n\nThe king receives a message from W. C. Jackson, the tax collector for [[Tirunelveli]], which demands a meeting with him at [[Ramanathapuram]] to discuss payment. Captain Davison, Kattabomman's British friend, advises him to see Jackson. Jackson, learning that Kattabomman has come with his troops, demands to meet him alone. At the meeting, Jackson insults him and orders him arrested. Surrounded by British troops, Kattabomman fights and escapes; however, his minister Thanapathi Sivasubramaniam Pillai is captured.\n\nSome time later, Pillai is released and brings news that Jackson has been sent back to England at Davison's recommendation. A British messenger sent to Kattabomman's court by Colonel S. R. Lushington, Tirunelveli's new revenue collector reports that Pillai and his men have looted their granaries and killed their men at [[Srivaikuntam]]. Pillai justifies his act, saying that he instructed his men to do it because of the famine in their kingdom. Ashamed of Pillai's action, Kattabomman accuses him of theft and murder. Pillai apologises and offers himself as a prisoner to the British, but Kattabomman refuses to hand him over; instead, he offers money to compensate for the looted rice. Lushington refuses the compensation and, with Major Bannerman's and Ettappan's help, incites the neighbouring rulers to attack Kattabomman. Bannerman is placed in charge of the British troops; he and Ettappan plan to attack Panchalankurichi when the people are attending a festival in Tiruchendur. Kattabomman's spy Sundaralingam informs the king, who prepares for war.\n\nOn the day of the battle, Vellaiyammal begs Vellaiyathevan not to go because she had a nightmare full of evil omens the previous night. Ignoring her entreaties, Vellaiyathevan sets out and is killed in the ensuing battle. When she learns of her husband's death, Vellaiyammal avenges him by killing the man who killed him. She finds Vellaiyathevan's body and, overcome by grief, falls dead across it. Bannerman's troops attack Panchalankurichi with heavy artillery, and Kattabomman's army suffers. The king, wounded in the neck, is saved by his brother [[Oomaithurai]]. Sensing that the fort cannot survive another cannon barrage, Kattabomman and Oomaithurai flee to the adjoining kingdom of [[Kovilpatti]]. Pillai, disguising himself as Kattabomman, decoys the British soldiers who are on the king's trail. From Kovilpatti, Kattabomman and Oomaithurai flee to [[Pudukkottai]]. Thondaimaan, the king of Pudukkottai, is ordered by the British to capture Kattabomman and Oomaithurai. Fearing the British, Thondaimaan captures them and hands them over. While Oomaithurai is jailed, Kattabomman is tried by the British and hanged.\n\n== Cast ==\n:''Note: Listing as per the film's opening credits.''<ref name=\"Credits\" />\n{{Col-begin|width=70%}}\n{{col-break|width=50%}}\n* [[Sivaji Ganesan]] as [[Veerapandiya Kattabomman|Kattabomman]]\n* [[Gemini Ganesan]] as Vellaiyadhevan\n* [[Padmini (actress)|Padmini]] as Vellaiyammal\n* [[S.

{"title_page": "Rim (firearms)", "text_new": "{{Refimprove|date=September 2010}}\n\nA '''rim''' is an external [[flange]] that is machined, cast, molded, stamped or pressed around the bottom of a [[firearm]]s [[cartridge (firearms)|cartridge]]. Thus, rimmed cartridges are sometimes called \"flanged\" cartridges. Almost all cartridges feature an extractor or headspacing rim, in spite of the fact that some cartridges are known as \"rimless cartridges\". The rim may serve a number of purposes, including providing a lip for the [[Extractor (firearms)|extractor]] to engage, and sometimes serving to [[headspace (firearms)|headspace]] the cartridge.\n\n==Types==\nThere are various types of firearms rims in use in modern ammunition.  These types are '''rimmed''', '''rimless''', '''semi-rimmed''', '''rebated rim''', and '''belted'''.  These categories describe the size of the rim in relation to the base of the case.\n\n[[Image:357 Magnum.jpg|thumb|right|Rimmed .357 Magnum revolver ammunition]]\n\n===Rimmed===\nThe rimmed cartridge, sometimes called '''flanged''' cartridge, is the oldest of the types and has a rim that is significantly larger in diameter than the base of the cartridge.  Rimmed cartridges use the rim to hold the cartridge in the [[Chamber (weaponry)|chamber]] of the firearm, with the rim serving to hold the cartridge at the proper depth in the chamber\u2014this function is called \"[[Headspace (firearms)|headspacing]]\". Because the rimmed cartridge headspaces on the rim, the case length is of less importance than with rimless cartridges.\n\nThis allows some firearms chambered for similar rimmed cartridges to safely chamber and fire shorter cartridges, such as using [[.38 Special]] cartridges in a [[.357 Magnum]] [[revolver]]. Rimmed cartridges are well suited to certain types of actions, such as revolvers and [[Break-action|break-]]<nowiki/>action firearms, where the rim helps hold the cartridge in position.\n\nRimmed cartridges generally do not work quite as well in firearms that feed from a [[magazine (firearm)|box magazine]], since the magazine must be carefully loaded so that the rim from each successive case is loaded ahead of the round beneath it, so the round will not snag on the rim of the cartridge below it as the bolt strips it out of the magazine. However, box magazine firearms firing rimmed cases have seen extensive use; the famous [[Lee\u2013Enfield]] rifle used by the UK, and the Russian (later Soviet) [[Mosin\u2013Nagant|Mosin-Nagant rifle]], were both used from before World War I until after World War II. Semi-automatic handguns have been chambered in rimmed cartridges as well, for example a [[LAR Grizzly Win Mag|LAR Grizzly]] or [[IMI Desert Eagle|Desert Eagle]] in .357 or .44 Magnum.\n\nSome types of rimmed cartridges, such as [[Rimfire ammunition|rimfire]] cartridges, also use the rim to contain the priming compound used to ignite the cartridge instead of a centrally-mounted [[Primer (firearm)|primer]] such as used in [[Centerfire ammunition|centerfire]] cartridges.<ref name=\"House2016\">{{cite book|last=House|first=James E|title=Gun Digest Book of .22 Rimfire|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VogFDQAAQBAJ&pg=PA9|date=21 October 2016|publisher=\"F+W Media, Inc.\"|isbn=978-1-4402-4659-3|pages=9\u201311}}</ref>\n\nUnder the [[Metric system|metric]] cartridge designation system, a capitalized \"R\" added at the end of the designation denotes a rimmed cartridge. For example, \"[[7.62\u00d754mmR]]\" is a rimmed cartridge, while \"[[7.62\u00d751mm NATO|7.62\u00d751mm]]\" is a rimless cartridge. Under [[Imperial units|Imperial]] designations, there is typically no distinction between rimmed and unrimmed cartridges, unless one is referring to a rimmed version of a cartridge which is typically rimless, such as the [[.45 Auto Rim]], a special rimmed version of the [[.45 ACP]] (aka \".45 Auto\"), intended for use in [[M1917 revolver|M1917 service revolvers]].\n\nExamples of rimmed handgun cartridges include the [[.38 Special]], [[.357 Magnum]] and [[.44 Magnum]]. Rimmed rifle cartridge examples include the [[.22 Hornet]], [[.303 British]] and [[7.62\u00d754mmR]].<ref name=\"Woodard2011\">{{cite book|last=Woodard|first=Todd|title=Shooter's Bible Guide to Cartridges|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UeBDCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA11|date=1 October 2011|publisher=[[Skyhorse Pub.]]|location=NY|isbn=978-1-61608-222-2|pages=11\u201316}}</ref>\n\n[[Image:9mmLuger.jpg|thumb|right|Rimless 9mm Parabellum pistol cartridges]]\n\n===Rimless===\nOn a \"rimless\" case, the rim has almost or exactly the same diameter as the base of the case; the recess formed between the rim and the body of the cartridge is known as an '''''[[Extractor (firearms)|extractor]] groove''''', since it forms a lip which can be grasped by an ''extractor'' to extract the empty case after being fired. Since there is no rim projecting past the edge of the case, the cartridge must headspace on the case mouth, for a straight walled case, or on the case's shoulder for a bottlenecked case (although a bottlenecked case ''can'' headspace on the case mouth, depending on the cartridge); the extractor groove serves only for extraction. The lack of a projecting rim makes rimless cases feed very smoothly from box magazines, and they are primarily used in firearms that feed from a [[Magazine (firearms)|box magazine]], although they also work well in [[Belt (firearms)|belt]], [[drum magazine|drum]] and [[Magazine (firearms)|tube-fed]] weapons. Rimless cases are not well suited to break-open and revolver actions, though they can be used with appropriate modifications, such as a spring-loaded extractor or, in a revolver, a [[moon clip]] (for example, the [[M1917 revolver|Colt or Smith & Wesson M1917]] revolvers in .45ACP).<ref name=\"Walker2013\"/>\n\nSince a straight-walled rimless cartridge is designed to headspace off of the case mouth, this prevents the ammunition loader or manufacturer from using a heavy crimp, which is a ring pinched or \"crimped\" into the cartridge case, designed to lock the bullet securely in place until fired. Crimping affects the overall length of the cartridge, and thus cannot be used on cartridges which headspace on the case mouth. This can be a problem for magnum revolvers or rifles which hold more than one round of ammunition, as the recoil from the firing successive rounds can loosen the bullets in the remaining cartridges, and cause their bullet seating depth to change, which can have a serious effect of accuracy. This is not an issue for [[break-action]] [[Single-shot|''single shot'']] firearms, for obvious reasons, although it could potentially cause problems in [[Double rifle|double]] rifles or \"[[Combination gun|drilling]]\"-type big game rifles, provided they have more than one rifle barrel (some \"drillings\" are made with three or more rifle barrels, without any shotgun component).\n\nExamples of rimless handgun cartridges include the [[9\u00d719mm Parabellum|9mm Parabellum]], [[.40 S&W]], and [[.45 ACP]]. Rimless rifle examples include the [[.223 Remington]], [[.308 Winchester]], [[.30-06 Springfield]] and [[7.92\u00d757mm Mauser]].<ref name=\"Walker2013\">{{cite book|last=Walker|first=Robert E.|title=Cartridges and Firearm Identification|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=THQ1iG8fSG8C&pg=PT100|date=21 March 2013|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-1-4665-8881-3|pages=100\u2013101}}</ref>\n\n===Semi-rimmed===\n[[Image:7.65x17 mm Browning ReconTanto.jpg|thumb|right|Semi-rimmed .32 ACP pistol cartridges]]\n\nOn a semi-rimmed case the rim projects slightly beyond the base of the case, though not as much as a rimmed cartridge. The tiny rim provides minimal interference feeding from a box magazine, while still providing enough surface to headspace on. Semi-rimmed cases are less common than the other types.<ref name=\"Walker2013\"/> \n\nThe [[.38 Super]], a higher pressure loading of the old .38 ACP case, is notorious for being less accurate than rimless cases, and so most modern .38 Super handguns are chambered so that the cartridge headspaces off the case mouth, like a rimless case.  If the chamber is cut shallow, so the case headspaces off the mouth, the rim is used for extraction only; a standard chamber will use the rim for both headspacing and extraction.<ref name=\"Sweeney2001\">{{cite book|last=Sweeney|first=Patrick|title=The Gun Digest Book of the 1911|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p2GoDkqOrrQC&pg=PA54|date=1 October 2001|publisher=Gun Digest Books|location=Iola, Wisconsin|isbn=0-87349-281-1|pages=53\u201355}}</ref>\n\nExamples of more commonly encountered semi-rimmed handgun cartridges are [[.25 ACP]], [[.32 ACP]] and [[.38 ACP]], while the [[.308 Marlin Express]], [[.338 Marlin Express]] and [[.444 Marlin]] are rifle cartridges that are semi-rimmed.<ref name=\"Walker2013\"/>\n\n===Rebated rim===\n[[Image:50giand45auto.png|thumb|right|The [[.50 GI]] (left) with rebated rim, compared to the rimless .45 ACP (right)]]\n\nRebated rim cartridges have a rim that is significantly smaller in diameter than the base of the case, serving only for extraction. Functionally the same as a rimless case, the rebated rim provides some additional benefits when considered in conjunction with other cartridges.<ref name=\"Walker2013\"/> \n\nOne example of a rebated rim cartridge is the [[.50 Action Express]] (or .50 AE), commonly chambered in the [[Desert Eagle]] pistol. In order to simplify production, and to decrease the cost of ownership, the .50 AE was designed with a rebated rim which matched the diameter of the rim of the [[.44 Magnum]], which was the most common caliber used in the Desert Eagle. By using the same rim dimensions as the .44 Magnum, a Desert Eagle could be converted from .44 Magnum to .50 AE by merely changing the [[Gun barrel|barrel]] and magazine. Other convertible cartridges, such as the short-lived [[.41 Action Express]] (with the same rim diameter as 9\u00d719mm Parabellum) used in the [[Jericho 941]] convertible pistol and [[Uzi]] submachine gun and carbine, would function in the same magazine, and thus required only a barrel change to change caliber.<ref name=\"Fitzpatrick2015\">{{cite book|last=Fitzpatrick|first=Brad|title=Handgun Buyer's Guide: A Complete Manual to Buying and Owning a Personal Firearm|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7SgQCwAAQBAJ&pg=PT368|date=17 November 2015|publisher=Skyhorse Publishing Company, Incorporated|location=New York|isbn=978-1-63450-966-4|pages=368\u2013369}}</ref><ref name=\"Woodard2016\"/>\n\nThe recent (early 2000s) [[Winchester Short Magnum]], [[Winchester Super Short Magnum]], and [[Remington Ultra Magnum]] and [[Remington Short Action Ultra Magnum]] families of rifle cartridges also feature rebated rims.

This round is used in specialized [[AR-15]] upper receivers, and the rim matches the size of the rim of the [[7.62\u00d739mm]], allowing those parts to be used in the custom-built upper receivers.<ref name=\"Massaro2014\"/>\n\nRebated rims were also a feature of the cartridges of [[Autocannon|automatic cannons]] derived from the [[20 mm Becker|20-mm Becker]], of which the best known belong to the [[Oerlikon 20 mm cannon|Oerlikon]] family. These \"[[API Blowback|advanced primer ignition\" (API) blowback]] weapons feature straight-sided chambers that are longer than necessary to contain the case. The face of the bolt has the same diameter as the case and follows it into the chamber. This means that the extraction claw also has to fit within the chamber, and therefore the case has a rebated rim. Another well known cartridge to use a rebated rim is the [[FN 5.7x28mm]], used in the [[FN Five-seveN]] semi-automatic handgun and [[FN P90]] personal defense weapon.\n\n===Belted===\n[[Image:375vs338.png|thumb|right|Belted .375 H&H Magnum (Left) .338 Winchester Magnum (Right) [[Quarter (United States coin)|US Quarter]] (24 mm) for scale]]\n\nThe original purpose of the \"belt\" on belted cases (often referred to as [[belted magnum]]s) was to provide headspacing; the extractor groove is cut into the belt just as it is cut into the case head on a rimless case. The belt acts as a rim on what is essentially a rimless case.  The design originated in England around 1910 with the [[.400/375 Belted Nitro Express]] (also known as the .375/.400 Holland & Holland, and .375 Velopex). The addition of the belt allowed the cartridge to properly headspace, despite the relative lack of a definite shoulder. The reason for the lack of a definitive shoulder was that these old British cartridge cases were intended for firing [[cordite]] charges instead of modern [[smokeless powder]]. Cordite was extruded as [[spaghetti]]-like rods, so the cartridge cases had to be fairly cylindrical shaped to accommodate the cordite propellant rods. The belt was carried through on other cartridges derived from the .375 Velopex, like the [[.375 Holland & Holland Magnum]] of 1912, in some cases to prevent the higher-pressure magnum cartridge from accidentally being chambered in a gun with a chamber of similar size.<ref name=\"Sweeney2014\">{{cite book|last=Sweeney|first=Patrick|title=Gunsmithing - The AR-15|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5CPGAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA84|date=13 February 2014|publisher=Krause Publications|location=Iola, Wisconsin|isbn=978-1-4402-3848-2|page=84}}</ref>\n\nIn the USA, the belt became somewhat synonymous with \"magnum\" during the late 20th century.  More recently, new \"magnum\" cartridges introduced in the USA have been rimless or used rebated rims based on the [[.404 Jeffery]] that fit the same .512\" bolt face used for the belted cases.<ref name=\"Lee2016\">{{cite book|last=Lee|first=Jerry|title=Gun Digest 2017|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=datxDAAAQBAJ&pg=PA115|date=12 August 2016|publisher=\"F+W Media, Inc.\"|location=Iola, Wisconsin|isbn=978-1-4402-4658-6|page=115}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of handgun cartridges]]\n* [[List of rifle cartridges]]\n* [[Table of handgun and rifle cartridges]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n* {{Cite book\n  | last = Ackley\n  | first = P.O.\n  | title = Handbook for Shooters & Reloaders\n  | edition = 12th Printing\n  | series = vol I\n  | origyear = 1962\n  | year = 1927\n  | publisher = Plaza Publishing\n  | location = Salt Lake City, Utah\n  | pages = 197\u2013202\n  | isbn = 978-99929-4-881-1}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Rim (Firearms)}}\n[[Category:Ammunition]]\n", "text_old": "{{Refimprove|date=September 2010}}\n\nA '''rim''' is an external [[flange]] that is machined, cast, molded, stamped or pressed around the bottom of a [[firearm]]s [[cartridge (firearms)|cartridge]].

However, box magazine firearms firing rimmed cases have seen extensive use; the famous [[Lee\u2013Enfield]] rifle used by the UK, and the Russian (later Soviet) [[Mosin\u2013Nagant|Mosin-Nagant rifle]], were both used from before World War I until after World War II. Semi-automatic handguns have been chambered in rimmed cartridges as well, for example a [[LAR Grizzly Win Mag|LAR Grizzly]] or [[IMI Desert Eagle|Desert Eagle]] in .357 or .44 Magnum.\n\nSome types of rimmed cartridges, such as [[Rimfire ammunition|rimfire]] cartridges, also use the rim to contain the priming compound used to ignite the cartridge instead of a centrally-mounted [[Primer (firearm)|primer]] such as used in [[Centerfire ammunition|centerfire]] cartridges.<ref name=\"House2016\">{{cite book|last=House|first=James E|title=Gun Digest Book of .22 Rimfire|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VogFDQAAQBAJ&pg=PA9|date=21 October 2016|publisher=\"F+W Media, Inc.\"|isbn=978-1-4402-4659-3|pages=9\u201311}}</ref>\n\nUnder the [[Metric system|metric]] cartridge designation system, a capitalized \"R\" added at the end of the designation denotes a rimmed cartridge. For example, \"[[7.62\u00d754mmR]]\" is a rimmed cartridge, while \"[[7.62\u00d751mm NATO|7.62\u00d751mm]]\" is a rimless cartridge. Under [[Imperial units|Imperial]] designations, there is typically no distinction between rimmed and unrimmed cartridges, unless one is referring to a rimmed version of a cartridge which is typically rimless, such as the [[.45 Auto Rim]], a special rimmed version of the [[.45 ACP]] (aka \".45 Auto\"), intended for use in [[M1917 revolver|M1917 service revolvers]].\n\nExamples of rimmed handgun cartridges include the [[.38 Special]], [[.357 Magnum]] and [[.44 Magnum]]. Rimmed rifle cartridge examples include the [[.22 Hornet]], [[.303 British]] and [[7.62\u00d754mmR]].<ref name=\"Woodard2011\">{{cite book|last=Woodard|first=Todd|title=Shooter's Bible Guide to Cartridges|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UeBDCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA11|date=1 October 2011|publisher=[[Skyhorse Pub.]]|location=NY|isbn=978-1-61608-222-2|pages=11\u201316}}</ref>\n\n[[Image:9mmLuger.jpg|thumb|right|Rimless 9mm Parabellum pistol cartridges]]\n\n===Rimless===\nOn a \"rimless\" case, the rim has almost or exactly the same diameter as the base of the case; the recess formed between the rim and the body of the cartridge is known as an '''''[[Extractor (firearms)|extractor]] groove''''', since it forms a lip which can be grasped by an ''extractor'' to extract the empty case after being fired. Since there is no rim projecting past the edge of the case, the cartridge must headspace on the case mouth, for a straight walled case, or on the case's shoulder for a bottlenecked case (although a bottlenecked case ''can'' headspace on the case mouth, depending on the cartridge); the extractor groove serves only for extraction. The lack of a projecting rim makes rimless cases feed very smoothly from box magazines, and they are primarily used in firearms that feed from a [[Magazine (firearms)|box magazine]], although they also work well in [[Belt (firearms)|belt]], [[drum magazine|drum]] and [[Magazine (firearms)|tube-fed]] weapons. Rimless cases are not well suited to break-open and revolver actions, though they can be used with appropriate modifications, such as a spring-loaded extractor or, in a revolver, a [[moon clip]] (for example, the [[M1917 revolver|Colt or Smith & Wesson M1917]] revolvers in .45ACP).<ref name=\"Walker2013\"/>\n\nSince a straight-walled rimless cartridge is designed to headspace off of the case mouth, this prevents the ammunition loader or manufacturer from using a heavy crimp, which is a ring pinched or \"crimped\" into the cartridge case, designed to lock the bullet securely in place until fired. Crimping affects the overall length of the cartridge, and thus cannot be used on cartridges which headspace on the case mouth. This can be a problem for magnum revolvers or rifles which hold more than one round of ammunition, as the recoil from the firing successive rounds can loosen the bullets in the remaining cartridges, and cause their bullet seating depth to change, which can have a serious effect of accuracy. This is not an issue for [[break-action]] [[Single-shot|''single shot'']] firearms, for obvious reasons, although it could potentially cause problems in [[Double rifle|double]] rifles or \"[[Combination gun|drilling]]\"-type big game rifles, provided they have more than one rifle barrel (some \"drillings\" are made with three or more rifle barrels, without any shotgun component).\n\nExamples of rimless handgun cartridges include the [[9\u00d719mm Parabellum|9mm Parabellum]], [[.40 S&W]], and [[.45 ACP]]. Rimless rifle examples include the [[.223 Remington]], [[.308 Winchester]], [[.30-06 Springfield]] and [[7.92\u00d757mm Mauser]].<ref name=\"Walker2013\">{{cite book|last=Walker|first=Robert E.|title=Cartridges and Firearm Identification|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=THQ1iG8fSG8C&pg=PT100|date=21 March 2013|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-1-4665-8881-3|pages=100\u2013101}}</ref>\n\n===Semi-rimmed===\n[[Image:7.65x17 mm Browning ReconTanto.jpg|thumb|right|Semi-rimmed .32 ACP pistol cartridges]]\n\nOn a semi-rimmed case the rim projects slightly beyond the base of the case, though not as much as a rimmed cartridge. The tiny rim provides minimal interference feeding from a box magazine, while still providing enough surface to headspace on. Semi-rimmed cases are less common than the other types.<ref name=\"Walker2013\"/> \n\nThe [[.38 Super]], a higher pressure loading of the old .38 ACP case, is notorious for being less accurate than rimless cases, and so most modern .38 Super handguns are chambered so that the cartridge headspaces off the case mouth, like a rimless case.  If the chamber is cut shallow, so the case headspaces off the mouth, the rim is used for extraction only; a standard chamber will use the rim for both headspacing and extraction.<ref name=\"Sweeney2001\">{{cite book|last=Sweeney|first=Patrick|title=The Gun Digest Book of the 1911|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p2GoDkqOrrQC&pg=PA54|date=1 October 2001|publisher=Gun Digest Books|location=Iola, Wisconsin|isbn=0-87349-281-1|pages=53\u201355}}</ref>\n\nExamples of more commonly encountered semi-rimmed handgun cartridges are [[.25 ACP]], [[.32 ACP]] and [[.38 ACP]], while the [[.308 Marlin Express]], [[.338 Marlin Express]] and [[.444 Marlin]] are rifle cartridges that are semi-rimmed.<ref name=\"Walker2013\"/>\n\n===Rebated rim===\n[[Image:50giand45auto.png|thumb|right|The [[.50 GI]] (left) with rebated rim, compared to the rimless .45 ACP (right)]]\n\nRebated rim cartridges have a rim that is significantly smaller in diameter than the base of the case, serving only for extraction. Functionally the same as a rimless case, the rebated rim provides some additional benefits when considered in conjunction with other cartridges.<ref name=\"Walker2013\"/> \n\nOne example of a rebated rim cartridge is the [[.50 Action Express]] (or .50 AE), commonly chambered in the [[Desert Eagle]] pistol. In order to simplify production, and to decrease the cost of ownership, the .50 AE was designed with a rebated rim which matched the diameter of the rim of the [[.44 Magnum]], which was the most common caliber used in the Desert Eagle. By using the same rim dimensions as the .44 Magnum, a Desert Eagle could be converted from .44 Magnum to .50 AE by merely changing the [[Gun barrel|barrel]] and magazine. Other convertible cartridges, such as the short-lived [[.41 Action Express]] (with the same rim diameter as 9\u00d719mm Parabellum) used in the [[Jericho 941]] convertible pistol and [[Uzi]] submachine gun and carbine, would function in the same magazine, and thus required only a barrel change to change caliber.<ref name=\"Fitzpatrick2015\">{{cite book|last=Fitzpatrick|first=Brad|title=Handgun Buyer's Guide: A Complete Manual to Buying and Owning a Personal Firearm|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7SgQCwAAQBAJ&pg=PT368|date=17 November 2015|publisher=Skyhorse Publishing Company, Incorporated|location=New York|isbn=978-1-63450-966-4|pages=368\u2013369}}</ref><ref name=\"Woodard2016\"/>\n\nThe recent (early 2000's) [[Winchester Short Magnum]], [[Winchester Super Short Magnum]], and [[Remington Ultra Magnum]] and [[Remington Short Action Ultra Magnum]] families of rifle cartridges also feature rebated rims.

This round is used in specialized [[AR-15]] upper receivers, and the rim matches the size of the rim of the [[7.62\u00d739mm]], allowing those parts to be used in the custom-built upper receivers.<ref name=\"Massaro2014\"/>\n\nRebated rims were also a feature of the cartridges of [[Autocannon|automatic cannons]] derived from the [[20 mm Becker|20-mm Becker]], of which the best known belong to the [[Oerlikon 20 mm cannon|Oerlikon]] family. These \"[[API Blowback|advanced primer ignition\" (API) blowback]] weapons feature straight-sided chambers that are longer than necessary to contain the case. The face of the bolt has the same diameter as the case and follows it into the chamber. This means that the extraction claw also has to fit within the chamber, and therefore the case has a rebated rim. Another well known cartridge to use a rebated rim is the [[FN 5.7x28mm]], used in the [[FN Five-seveN]] semi-automatic handgun and [[FN P90]] personal defense weapon.\n\n===Belted===\n[[Image:375vs338.png|thumb|right|Belted .375 H&H Magnum (Left) .338 Winchester Magnum (Right) [[Quarter (United States coin)|US Quarter]] (24 mm) for scale]]\n\nThe original purpose of the \"belt\" on belted cases (often referred to as [[belted magnum]]s) was to provide headspacing; the extractor groove is cut into the belt just as it is cut into the case head on a rimless case. The belt acts as a rim on what is essentially a rimless case.  The design originated in England around 1910 with the [[.400/375 Belted Nitro Express]] (also known as the .375/.400 Holland & Holland, and .375 Velopex). The addition of the belt allowed the cartridge to properly headspace, despite the relative lack of a definite shoulder. The reason for the lack of a definitive shoulder was that these old British cartridge cases were intended for firing [[cordite]] charges instead of modern [[smokeless powder]]. Cordite was extruded as [[spaghetti]]-like rods, so the cartridge cases had to be fairly cylindrical shaped to accommodate the cordite propellant rods. The belt was carried through on other cartridges derived from the .375 Velopex, like the [[.375 Holland & Holland Magnum]] of 1912, in some cases to prevent the higher-pressure magnum cartridge from accidentally being chambered in a gun with a chamber of similar size.<ref name=\"Sweeney2014\">{{cite book|last=Sweeney|first=Patrick|title=Gunsmithing - The AR-15|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5CPGAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA84|date=13 February 2014|publisher=Krause Publications|location=Iola, Wisconsin|isbn=978-1-4402-3848-2|page=84}}</ref>\n\nIn the USA, the belt became somewhat synonymous with \"magnum\" during the late 20th century.  More recently, new \"magnum\" cartridges introduced in the USA have been rimless or used rebated rims based on the [[.404 Jeffery]] that fit the same .512\" bolt face used for the belted cases.<ref name=\"Lee2016\">{{cite book|last=Lee|first=Jerry|title=Gun Digest 2017|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=datxDAAAQBAJ&pg=PA115|date=12 August 2016|publisher=\"F+W Media, Inc.\"|location=Iola, Wisconsin|isbn=978-1-4402-4658-6|page=115}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of handgun cartridges]]\n* [[List of rifle cartridges]]\n* [[Table of handgun and rifle cartridges]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n* {{Cite book\n  | last = Ackley\n  | first = P.O.\n  | title = Handbook for Shooters & Reloaders\n  | edition = 12th Printing\n  | series = vol I\n  | origyear = 1962\n  | year = 1927\n  | publisher = Plaza Publishing\n  | location = Salt Lake City, Utah\n  | pages = 197\u2013202\n  | isbn = 978-99929-4-881-1}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Rim (Firearms)}}\n[[Category:Ammunition]]\n", "name_user": "Alistair1978", "label": "safe", "comment": "typo (viaWP:JWB)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rim_(firearms)"}

This episode deals with Red Riding Hood's backstory, and Ruby being hired by Emma.\n\nIt was written by [[Jane Espenson]], while being directed by [[Ron Underwood]].\n\n==Plot==\n===Opening sequence===\nRed Riding Hood is shown in the forest.\n\n===In the characters' past===\nIn a small village in the Enchanted Forest, a happy, cloak-wearing Red Riding Hood ([[Meghan Ory]]) flirts with her love Peter ([[Jesse Hutch]]) through her window before being called away by her Granny ([[Beverley Elliott]]), also known as the Widow Lucas. A group of villagers show up at their cottage door, planning to go after a giant wolf that has been killing their sheep. Red asks if she can go, but Granny refuses to let her and tells her to stay inside with her cloak on\u2014even after they secure their cottage. The following morning, Red goes to check on the chickens, only to come across a sleepy Snow White ([[Ginnifer Goodwin]]). Red agrees to help Snow, who, being a fugitive, asks to be called Mary. When they go to the well for water, they notice the water is filled with blood and find a trail of slaughtered bodies left lying on the snowy ground. Later on, during a town hall meeting, Granny tells the citizens of her own encounter with another wolf, which killed her family 60 years earlier and left her with a scarred arm. She claims that there is no way anyone can kill the creature. Despite this, Red and a reluctant Snow decide to search for the wolf on their own.\n\nRed, a superior tracker, finds the wolf prints, but they morph into human boot prints as the duo follow them. Worse, they lead to Red's window and the only person she remembers seeing there is Peter. That night, Red meets Peter to tell him he is a werewolf. She has to tie him up on full moon nights, but she will stay with him. Back at Granny's cottage, Granny finds Snow posing as Red in her cloak on her bed. Snow assures Granny they are safe since Red has Peter tied up. Granny is dismayed at this and explains that Red is the wolf and the curse has been passed among the family. Granny herself was a wolf but has lost most of her power due to age, though she can still track Red by scent. They find the tree where Red tied up Peter, but it is too late\u2014she has already transformed and devoured him. Granny strikes Red with a silver-tipped arrow and orders Snow to put the cloak over her as it is magical and keeps the wearer from becoming a wolf. Red returns to her human form, confused at first, then horrified to discover what she has done. The hunting party closes in as Granny tells the girls to make their escape into the woods.\n\n===In Storybrooke===\nAt the sheriff's office, [[Emma Swan]] ([[Jennifer Morrison]]) asks David Nolan ([[Joshua Dallas|Josh Dallas]]) a few questions about Kathryn's absence, but since there is no proof of a crime, she lets him go. Elsewhere at Granny's Diner, Ruby (Ory) is chatting with August ([[Eion Bailey]]), who tells her about his world travels. Granny calls her over and tells her to start the paperwork that comes with extra business. Ruby answers that she would rather see the world like August and quits her tedious job. Emma and Mary Margaret (Goodwin) run into Ruby trying to brush off Dr. Whale ([[David Anders]]), and get a ride out of town. They offer to take her home with them so she can figure things out. Mary Margaret later goes to the spot where Kathryn had disappeared and runs into David, who is now acting strange and keeps repeating over and over that he's looking for his wife, leaving Mary Margaret very concerned about his behavior.\n\nBack in the sheriff's office, Henry ([[Jared S. Gilmore]]) helps Ruby look for jobs, such as being a bike courier. When Ruby answers the phone and takes messages for Emma, she applauds her for her help and offers her a job as her assistant. Ruby goes to pick up lunch for everyone just as Mary Margaret walks in to tell Emma everything that happened with David. At the diner, Ruby tries to flaunt how happy she is now, but Granny doesn't seem to buy it. She tells Ruby her new job is basically the same as her old one, majorly cutting down Ruby's confidence. When she returns with the food, Emma tells Ruby that she's going to do real police work and help her find David. They follow tracks in the woods when Ruby hears something. With Ruby in the lead, she and Emma find David groaning and barely conscious. He reveals that he doesn't remember anything since leaving the sheriff's office the previous night. At the same time, Ruby doesn\u2019t know how she found him.\n\nIn the hospital, Dr. Whale tells David and Emma that there is a good chance he was asleep during the whole ordeal and it might have been the same thing as when he came out of his coma. Regina ([[Lana Parrilla]]) then barges in, being David's emergency contact, and immediately tells Emma to leave. In the hall, Emma calls Ruby, telling her to go to the Toll Bridge and see if she finds anything. There, Ruby uses her unknown senses and instincts to find a box buried under a washed-up piece of wood. She screams in horror when she sees what is inside of the box. Back in the office, Emma opens the box. She tells Ruby she did a good job, but Ruby doesn't feel cut out for the excitement of police work. Ruby goes to the diner where she talks to Granny who reveals that the markings on her arm are here in Storybrooke and that her arm bothers her once a month. Granny tells Ruby she had asked her to learn every part of running the diner so that when she retires, she can leave the diner to her. Granny wants to leave it to someone who loves it as well. After hugging her, Ruby gets her job back and turns down Emma's job offer.\n\nAt David's place of work, he paces in the lobby with Mary Margaret trying to calm him down. Emma comes in to tell them about the box, which contained a human heart and fingerprints inside. David reacts right away, telling Emma to put him in handcuffs, but she stops him to reveal that the fingerprints belong to another suspect, Mary Margaret.\n\n==Production==\n\"Red-Handed\" was written by consulting producer [[Jane Espenson]], while ''[[Tremors (film)|Tremors]]'' director, [[Ron Underwood]], directed the episode.\n\nBeverley later recalled that her friends all assumed that Peter was the wolf of the story, and never suspected that Red might be. \"The whole room screamed,\" she said, when they learned the truth.<ref name=modernworld>{{cite video |people=[[Meghan Ory]], [[Beverley Elliott]] |date=2011 |title=Fairy Tales in the Modern World | medium=DVD |publisher=[[Disney-ABC Domestic Television]] |location=''Once Upon a Time: The Complete First Season'' Disc 5 }}</ref>\n\nIt was included in ''Reawakened: A Once Upon a Time Tale'' \u2013 a novelization of the first season \u2013 which was published by [[Hachette Books#Hyperion Books|Hyperion Books]] in 2013.<ref>{{Cite book| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=M73u9ZPbIlgC&pg=PT39&lpg=PT39&dq=once+upon+a+time+%22snow+falls%22#v=onepage&q=once%20upon%20a%20time%20%22snow%20falls%22&f=false | title = Reawakened: A Once Upon a Time Tale |publisher=[[Hachette Books|Hyperion Books]] | isbn = 9781401305499 | last1 = Beane | first1 = Odette | date = 2013}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Reawakened: A Once Upon a Time Tale |publisher=[[WorldCat]] |oclc = 837922499}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Ratings===\nThe episode first aired on March 11, 2012.

Despite this, Red and a reluctant Snow decide to search for the wolf on their own.\n\nRed, a superior tracker, finds the wolf prints, but they morph into human boot prints as the duo follow them. Worse, they lead to Red's window and the only person she remembers seeing there is Peter. That night, Red meets Peter to tell him he is a werewolf. She has to tie him up on full moon nights, but she will stay with him. Back at Granny's cottage, Granny finds Snow posing as Red in her cloak on her bed. Snow assures Granny they are safe since Red has Peter tied up. Granny is dismayed at this and explains that Red is the wolf and the curse has been passed among the family. Granny herself was a wolf but has lost most of her power due to age, though she can still track Red by scent. They find the tree where Red tied up Peter, but it is too late\u2014she has already transformed and devoured him. Granny strikes Red with a silver-tipped arrow and orders Snow to put the cloak over her as it is magical and keeps the wearer from becoming a wolf. Red returns to her human form, confused at first, then horrified to discover what she has done. The hunting party closes in as Granny tells the girls to make their escape into the woods.\n\n===In Storybrooke===\nAt the sheriff's office, [[Emma Swan]] ([[Jennifer Morrison]]) asks David Nolan ([[Joshua Dallas|Josh Dallas]]) a few questions about Kathryn's absence, but since there is no proof of a crime, she lets him go. Elsewhere at Granny's Diner, Ruby (Ory) is chatting with August ([[Eion Bailey]]), who tells her about his world travels. Granny calls her over and tells her to start the paperwork that comes with extra business. Ruby answers that she would rather see the world like August and quits her tedious job. Emma and Mary Margaret (Goodwin) run into Ruby trying to brush off Dr. Whale ([[David Anders]]), and get a ride out of town. They offer to take her home with them so she can figure things out. Mary Margaret later goes to the spot where Kathryn had disappeared and runs into David, who is now acting strange and keeps repeating over and over that he's looking for his wife, leaving Mary Margaret very concerned about his behavior.\n\nBack in the sheriff's office, Henry ([[Jared S. Gilmore]]) helps Ruby look for jobs, such as being a bike courier. When Ruby answers the phone and takes messages for Emma, she applauds her for her help and offers her a job as her assistant. Ruby goes to pick up lunch for everyone just as Mary Margaret walks in to tell Emma everything that happened with David. At the diner, Ruby tries to flaunt how happy she is now, but Granny doesn't seem to buy it. She tells Ruby her new job is basically the same as her old one, majorly cutting down Ruby's confidence. When she returns with the food, Emma tells Ruby that she's going to do real police work and help her find David. They follow tracks in the woods when Ruby hears something. With Ruby in the lead, she and Emma find David groaning and barely conscious. He reveals that he doesn't remember anything since leaving the sheriff's office the previous night. At the same time, Ruby doesn\u2019t know how she found him.\n\nIn the hospital, Dr. Whale tells David and Emma that there is a good chance he was asleep during the whole ordeal and it might have been the same thing as when he came out of his coma. Regina ([[Lana Parrilla]]) then barges in, being David's emergency contact, and immediately tells Emma to leave. In the hall, Emma calls Ruby, telling her to go to the Toll Bridge and see if she finds anything. There, Ruby uses her unknown senses and instincts to find a box buried under a washed-up piece of wood. She screams in horror when she sees what is inside of the box. Back in the office, Emma opens the box. She tells Ruby she did a good job, but Ruby doesn't feel cut out for the excitement of police work. Ruby goes to the diner where she talks to Granny who reveals that the markings on her arm are here in Storybrooke and that her arm bothers her once a month. Granny tells Ruby she had asked her to learn every part of running the diner so that when she retires, she can leave the diner to her. Granny wants to leave it to someone who loves it as well. After hugging her, Ruby gets her job back and turns down Emma's job offer.\n\nAt David's place of work, he paces in the lobby with Mary Margaret trying to calm him down. Emma comes in to tell them about the box, which contained a human heart and fingerprints inside. David reacts right away, telling Emma to put him in handcuffs, but she stops him to reveal that the fingerprints belong to another suspect, Mary Margaret.\n\n==Production==\n\"Red-Handed\" was written by consulting producer [[Jane Espenson]], while ''[[Tremors (film)|Tremors]]'' director, [[Ron Underwood]], directed the episode.\n\nBeverley later recalled that her friends all assumed that Peter was the wolf of the story, and never suspected that Red might be. \"The whole room screamed,\" she said, when they learned the truth.<ref name=modernworld>{{cite video |people=[[Meghan Ory]], [[Beverley Elliott]] |date=2011 |title=Fairy Tales in the Modern World | medium=DVD |publisher=[[Disney-ABC Domestic Television]] |location=''Once Upon a Time: The Complete First Season'' Disc 5 }}</ref>\n\nIt was included in ''Reawakened: A Once Upon a Time Tale'' \u2013 a novelization of the first season \u2013 which was published by [[Hyperion Books]] in 2013.<ref>{{Cite book| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=M73u9ZPbIlgC&pg=PT39&lpg=PT39&dq=once+upon+a+time+%22snow+falls%22#v=onepage&q=once%20upon%20a%20time%20%22snow%20falls%22&f=false | title = Reawakened: A Once Upon a Time Tale |publisher=[[Hachette Books|Hyperion Books]] | isbn = 9781401305499 | last1 = Beane | first1 = Odette | date = 2013}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Reawakened: A Once Upon a Time Tale |publisher=[[WorldCat]] |oclc = 837922499}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Ratings===\nThe episode first aired on March 11, 2012.

It is owned by [[MGM Growth Properties]] and operated by [[MGM Resorts International]].\n\n==History==\nYonkers Raceway, considered a city landmark, was opened in 1899 by William H. Clark's Empire City Trotting Club. Clark died in 1900 and, with much litigation by his heirs over its proposed sale, the track remained closed for most of the next seven years except for special events. One such event occurred in 1902 when [[Barney Oldfield]] set a one-mile (1.6&nbsp;km) record in an automobile at Empire City Race Track. Driving the [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] '999', he covered the distance in 55.54 seconds.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rumbledrome.com/barneyracer.html |title=Barney Oldfield, the Racer |work=Rumbledrome |accessdate=16 December 2010 | url-status = dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110715214255/http://www.rumbledrome.com/barneyracer.html | archive-date = July 15, 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe facility was purchased by New York grocery store magnate [[James Butler (grocer)|James Butler]], who reopened it for [[Thoroughbred horse race|Thoroughbred horse racing]] in 1907. Among the notable thoroughbreds who raced at Empire City, in 1936 [[Seabiscuit]] won the [[Scarsdale Handicap]]. After Butler's death in 1934, the track continued to host \"[[flat racing|the flats]]\" until 1942 when it was converted back to being a harness track. Some of its feature races were taken over by other New York area racetracks.\n\n===Historic Thoroughbred flat races===\n*[[Empire City Handicap]] (1900\u20131953)\n*[[Yonkers Handicap]] (1907-1946)\n*[[Whirl Stakes]] (1908\u20131930)\n*[[Empire City Derby]] (1917\u20131933)\n*[[Scarsdale Handicap]] (1918\u20131947)\n*[[Butler Handicap]] (1935\u20131953)\n*[[Empire City Gold Cup]] (1947\u20131953)\n\nIn 1950, [[William H. Cane]], for whom the [[Cane Pace]] is named, headed a syndicate formed as the Algam Corporation which acquired Empire City and converted it to Yonkers Raceway. Its popularity having greatly declined since the 1960s (when crowds would occasionally reach 50,000), the entire property, according to some, had become an eyesore due to its owners leaving it in a state of disrepair.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}\n\nIn 1972, the [[Rooney family]] acquired Yonkers Raceway.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.empirecitycasino.com/about-us/ |title=About Us | work = Empire City Casino |publisher= Yonkers Racing Corporation |accessdate=3 February 2016}}</ref> It underwent some cosmetic changes in the late 1990s. It was used as a flea market, and hosted the annual Westchester County Fair, sponsored by the county's Parks Department. In 1996, the finish line was relocated to the end of the stretch, increasing the length of the stretch from {{convert|440|ft|m}} to the current {{convert|660|ft|m}}. The following year, the grandstand was demolished. There was consideration on selling the site to the National Football League Jets that would have included a stadium; however, the plan was shelved after the environmental impact statement showed there would be significant traffic from elsewhere in the metropolitan area, and there was not enough political support for it.\n\nIn 2015, Yonkers Raceway applied for permission from the [[New York State Gaming Commission]] to relocate its finish line back by approximately 100 feet. This proposal was endorsed by the New York division of the Standardbred Owners Association.<ref>{{cite press release |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=SOA of New York supports moving Yonkers finish line |url=http://xwebapp.ustrotting.com/absolutenm/templates/article.aspx?articleid=64967 | publisher = [[United States Trotting Association]] |location=Yonkers, New York |date=July 1, 2015 |access-date=April 1, 2016}}</ref> As of 2018, the new finish line has been in use for a considerable period of time.

It is now the host track for another leg, the [[Messenger Stakes]]. Yonkers is also home to the [[Yonkers Trot]], one of the legs of the [[Triple Crown of Harness Racing for Trotters]]. Due to the renovations at Yonkers, the Messenger and Yonkers Trot were moved to different racetracks for the 2004 and 2005 editions. The Messenger was moved to [[Harrington Raceway & Casino|Harrington Raceway]] in [[Delaware]] in both years, and the Yonkers Trot was moved to [[Hawthorne Race Course]] in [[Stickney, IL]] in 2004, and [[Freehold Raceway]] in [[New Jersey]] in 2005.\n\nYonkers Raceway ran the Yonkers Trot and the Messenger on November 25, 2006, becoming the first harness track in America to host two Triple Crown races on the same day. [[Glidemaster]], by virtue of winning the $728,000 Yonkers Trot, became the eighth horse to clinch the Trotting Triple Crown; the trotter would go on to be named 2006 ''Harness Horse of the Year''.\n\nYonkers Raceway is also home to the Art Rooney Pace for three-year-olds. However, continued delays in the reopening of the track forced the 2006 edition of the race to be moved to [[Monticello Raceway]].<ref>{{cite press release |title=Monticello's richest day to go postward on Friday | first = John | last = Manzi | location = Monticello, New York | publisher=Monticello Raceway |date=November 8, 2006 |url=http://www.ustrotting.com/absolutenm/anmviewer.asp?a=18691&z=1 |accessdate=November 9, 2006 |url-status=dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110717181403/http://xwebapp.ustrotting.com/absolutenm/templates/?a=18691&z=1 | archive-date = July 17, 2011}}</ref> The final of the 2007 Art Rooney Pace, run on June 2, 2007, was the richest race in Yonkers history, with a $1 million purse.

It is owned by [[MGM Growth Properties]] and operated by [[MGM Resorts International]].\n\n==History==\nYonkers Raceway, considered a city landmark, was opened in 1899 by William H. Clark's Empire City Trotting Club. Clark died in 1900 and, with much litigation by his heirs over its proposed sale, the track remained closed for most of the next seven years except for special events. One such event occurred in 1902 when [[Barney Oldfield]] set a one-mile (1.6&nbsp;km) record in an automobile at Empire City Race Track. Driving the [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] '999', he covered the distance in 55.54 seconds.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rumbledrome.com/barneyracer.html |title=Barney Oldfield, the Racer |work=Rumbledrome |accessdate=16 December 2010 | url-status = dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110715214255/http://www.rumbledrome.com/barneyracer.html | archive-date = July 15, 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe facility was purchased by New York grocery store magnate [[James Butler (grocer)|James Butler]], who reopened it for [[Thoroughbred horse race|Thoroughbred horse racing]] in 1907. Among the notable thoroughbreds who raced at Empire City, in 1936 [[Seabiscuit]] won the [[Scarsdale Handicap]]. After Butler's death in 1934, the track continued to host \"[[flat racing|the flats]]\" until 1942 when it was converted back to being a harness track. Some of its feature races were taken over by other New York area racetracks.\n\n===Historic Thoroughbred flat races===\n*[[Empire City Handicap]] (1900\u20131953)\n*[[Yonkers Handicap]] (1907-1946)\n*[[Whirl Stakes]] (1908\u20131930)\n*[[Empire City Derby]] (1917\u20131933)\n*[[Scarsdale Handicap]] (1918\u20131947)\n*[[Butler Handicap]] (1935\u20131953)\n*[[Empire City Gold Cup]] (1947\u20131953)\n\nIn 1950, [[William H. Cane]], for whom the [[Cane Pace]] is named, headed a syndicate formed as the Algam Corporation which acquired Empire City and converted it to Yonkers Raceway. Its popularity having greatly declined since the 1960s (when crowds would occasionally reach 50,000), the entire property, according to some, had become an eyesore due to its owners leaving it in a state of disrepair.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}\n\nIn 1972, the [[Rooney family]] acquired Yonkers Raceway.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.empirecitycasino.com/about-us/ |title=About Us | work = Empire City Casino |publisher= Yonkers Racing Corporation |accessdate=3 February 2016}}</ref> It underwent some cosmetic changes in the late 1990s. It was used as a flea market, and hosted the annual Westchester County Fair, sponsored by the county's Parks Department. In 1996, the finish line was relocated to the end of the stretch, increasing the length of the stretch from {{convert|440|ft|m}} to the current {{convert|660|ft|m}}. The following year, the grandstand was demolished. There was consideration on selling the site to the National Football League Jets that would have included a stadium; however, the plan was shelved after the environmental impact statement showed there would be significant traffic from elsewhere in the metropolitan area, and there was not enough political support for it.\n\nIn 2015, Yonkers Raceway applied for permission from the [[New York State Gaming Commission]] to relocate its finish line back by approximately 100 feet. This proposal was endorsed by the New York division of the Standardbred Owners Association.<ref>{{cite press release |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=SOA of New York supports moving Yonkers finish line |url=http://xwebapp.ustrotting.com/absolutenm/templates/article.aspx?articleid=64967 | publisher = [[United States Trotting Association]] |location=Yonkers, New York |date=July 1, 2015 |access-date=April 1, 2016}}</ref> As of 2018, the new finish line has been in use for a considerable period of time.

Due to the renovations at Yonkers, the Messenger and Yonkers Trot were moved to different racetracks for the 2004 and 2005 editions. The Messenger was moved to [[Harrington Raceway & Casino|Harrington Raceway]] in [[Delaware]] in both years, and the Yonkers Trot was moved to [[Hawthorne Race Course]] in [[Stickney, IL]] in 2004, and [[Freehold Raceway]] in [[New Jersey]] in 2005.\n\nYonkers Raceway ran the Yonkers Trot and the Messenger on November 25, 2006, becoming the first harness track in America to host two Triple Crown races on the same day. [[Glidemaster]], by virtue of winning the $728,000 Yonkers Trot, became the eighth horse to clinch the Trotting Triple Crown; the trotter would go on to be named 2006 ''Harness Horse of the Year''.\n\nYonkers Raceway is also home to the Art Rooney Pace for three-year-olds. However, continued delays in the reopening of the track forced the 2006 edition of the race to be moved to [[Monticello Raceway]].<ref>{{cite press release |title=Monticello's richest day to go postward on Friday | first = John | last = Manzi | location = Monticello, New York | publisher=Monticello Raceway |date=November 8, 2006 |url=http://www.ustrotting.com/absolutenm/anmviewer.asp?a=18691&z=1 |accessdate=November 9, 2006 |url-status=dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110717181403/http://xwebapp.ustrotting.com/absolutenm/templates/?a=18691&z=1 | archive-date = July 17, 2011}}</ref> The final of the 2007 Art Rooney Pace, run on June 2, 2007, was the richest race in Yonkers history, with a $1 million purse.

In childhood, she had interfered in a fight between her parents, causing them to fall off the terrace to their deaths. When a producer touches her at work, she reacts by slicing his nose with a knife. She is then sent to an asylum. Her uncle manages her property and offers her house as a rental to a young married couple. Keshav is the husband to Reema. Bobby is obsessed with the couple and spies and stalks them constantly. Reema dies in a fire in the kitchen when a bottle of pesticide explodes. Bobby suspects Keshav and tries to get the police to investigate him but they find no evidence. She hallucinates Keshav threatening her and hits him with a chair in front of the police. She is put back in the asylum. It is revealed that she is imagining things; during electric shock treatment, she remembers that she threw the pesticide on the wife because she hallucinated a cockroach on her.\n\nTwo years later, Bobby is taking her meds but not leaving her house. Her cousin in London arranges for Bobby to be an understudy in a re-imagining of the [[Ramayana]] that she is helping design. When Bobby meets her cousin's new husband, it turns out to be Keshav. Keshav warns his wife that Bobby is not stable but his wife does not believe him. Bobby starts to lose herself in the character of Sita that she is understudying. She believes Keshav is Raavan and it is up to her to defeat him. Keshav panics and reaches out to her old boyfriend, Varun, who confirms that she obsesses over things and had imagined him to be a criminal. He breaks into her house and finds boxes of photos with Bobby photoshopped in instead of Keshav's wife. A photo of Keshav's wedding to her cousin proves that Bobby knew beforehand that they were married.\n\nKeshav confronts Bobby. The next morning, he tells his wife that Bobby tried to kiss him, and she in turn tells his wife that he tried to rape her. When she later sees Keshav backstage, she grabs an ax and chases him, cutting a rope that sends a light falling. Afraid she has hurt someone, she goes on the run and gains three hallucinatory friends. They take her to a library, where she researches Keshav and thinks she has found evidence that he is a serial killer who takes on new identities and kills his wives. She returns to the house to confront him, dressed as Sita, ties up her pregnant cousin and when Keshav arrives, threatens him.

In childhood, she had interfered in a fight between her parents, causing them to fall off the terrace to their deaths. When a producer touches her at work, she reacts by slicing his nose with a knife. She is then sent to an asylum. Her uncle manages her property and offers her house as a rental to a young married couple. Keshav is the husband to Reema. Bobby is obsessed with the couple and spies and stalks them constantly. Reema dies in a fire in the kitchen when a bottle of pesticide explodes. Bobby suspects Keshav and tries to get the police to investigate him but they find no evidence. She hallucinates Keshav threatening her and hits him with a chair in front of the police. She is put back in the asylum. It is revealed that she is imagining things; during electric shock treatment, she remembers that she threw the pesticide on the wife because she hallucinated a cockroach on her.\n\nTwo years later, Bobby is taking her meds but not leaving her house. Her cousin in London arranges for Bobby to be an understudy in a re-imagining of the [[Ramayana]] that she is helping design. When Bobby meets her cousin's new husband, it turns out to be Keshav. Keshav warns his wife that Bobby is not stable but his wife does not believe him. Bobby starts to lose herself in the character of Sita that she is understudying. She believes Keshav is Raavan and it is up to her to defeat him. Keshav panics and reaches out to her old boyfriend, Varun, who confirms that she obsesses over things and had imagined him to be a criminal. He breaks into her house and finds boxes of photos with Bobby photoshopped in instead of Keshav's wife. A photo of Keshav's wedding to her cousin proves that Bobby knew beforehand that they were married.\n\nKeshav confronts Bobby. The next morning, he tells his wife that Bobby tried to kiss him, and she in turn tells his wife that he tried to rape her. When she later sees Keshav backstage, she grabs an ax and chases him, cutting a rope that sends a light falling. Afraid she has hurt someone, she goes on the run and gains three hallucinatory friends. They take her to a library, where she researches Keshav and thinks she has found evidence that he is a serial killer who takes on new identities and kills his wives. She returns to the house to confront him, dressed as Sita, ties up her pregnant cousin and when Keshav arrives, threatens him. Keshav tries to reason with her before revealing that he IS indeed a serial killer. He even killed his first wife, throwing the match on her after Bobby covered her in pesticide. Bobby fights him and she and her cousin are both saved when Keshav is burnt alive in the same manner in which his victims burned to death. At the end, she strides down the street in London surrounded by her hallucinations proudly declaring that she is what she is and will not change.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Rajkummar Rao]] as Keshav Kumar\n*[[Kangana Ranaut]] as Bobby Grewal\n*[[Jimmy Shergill]] as Shridhar Awasthi<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://mumbaimirror.indiatimes.com/entertainment/bollywood/jimmy-shergill-joins-kangana-ranauts-mental-hai-kya/articleshow/64753487.cms|title=Jimmy Shergill joins Kangana Ranaut's Mental Hai Kya|work=Mumbai Mirror|access-date=2 December 2018}}</ref>\n* [[Amyra Dastur]] as Reema Kumar (nee Agnihotri)<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.hindustantimes.com/bollywood/amyra-dastur-joins-rajkummar-rao-kangana-ranaut-in-mental-hai-kya/story-wTgJscKrXiNCfpGzpN0BzI.html|title=Amyra Dastur joins Rajkummar Rao, Kangana Ranaut in Mental Hai Kya|date=23 May 2018|website=hindustan times|access-date=2 December 2018|language=en}}</ref>\n* [[Amrita Puri]] as Megha Kumar\n*[[Kanika Dhillon]] as Sita\n* [[Brijendra Kala]] as Officer Ram Pandey\n* [[Satish Kaushik]] as Officer Durjan Deshmukh<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://mumbaimirror.indiatimes.com/entertainment/bollywood/satish-kaushik-joins-kangana-ranaut-and-rajkummar-rao-in-mental-hai-kya/articleshow/64392199.cms|title=Satish Kaushik joins Kangana Ranaut and Rajkummar Rao in Mental Hai Kya|work=Mumbai Mirror|access-date=2 December 2018}}</ref>\n*[[Lalit Behl]] as Uncle\n*[[Hussain Dalal]] as Varun Bahl\n<!--As this film has not been released, any additions to this section must be sourced per WP:CRYSTAL-->\n\n== Production ==\n\n=== Filming ===\nPrincipal photography of the film began on 16 May 2018, in Mumbai.<ref name=\":0\"/> After completing the shooting in Mumbai, the production team went to London for next schedule.
