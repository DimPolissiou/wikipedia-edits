So in political science and history, a public is a population of individuals in association with civic affairs, or affairs of office or state.  In social psychology, marketing, and public relations, a public has a more situational definition.{{sfn|Vasquez|Taylor|2001|pp=140}} [[John Dewey]] defined {{harv|Dewey|1927}} public as a group of people who, in facing a similar problem, recognize it and organize themselves to address it. Dewey's definition of a public is thus situational: people organized about a situation. Built upon this situational definition of a public is the [[situational theory of publics]] by [[James E. Grunig]] {{harv|Grunig|1983}}, which talks of ''nonpublics'' (who have no problem), ''latent publics'' (who have a problem), ''aware publics'' (who recognize that they have a problem), and ''active publics'' (who do something about their problem).{{sfn|Rawlins|Bowen|2005|pp=720&ndash;721}}{{sfn|Toth|2006|pp=506&ndash;507}}\n\nIn public relations and communication theory, a public is distinct from a [[Stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholder]] or a [[Market (economics)|market]]. A public is a subset of the set of stakeholders for an organization, that comprises those people concerned with a specific issue. Whilst a market has an exchange relationship with an organization, and is usually a passive entity that is created by the organization, a public does not necessarily have an exchange relationship, and is both self-creating and self-organizing.{{sfn|Rawlins|Bowen|2005|pp=721}} Publics are targeted by public relations efforts. In this, ''target publics'' are those publics whose involvement is necessary for achieving organization goals; ''intervening publics'' are opinion formers and mediators, who pass information to the target publics; and ''influentials'' are publics that the target publics turn to for consultation, whose value judgements are influential upon how a target public will judge any public relations material.{{sfn|Rawlins|Bowen|2005|pp=720&ndash;721}} The public is often targeted especially in regard to political agendas as their vote is necessary in order to further the progression of the cause.

While there, he became known for his brand of sarcasm, and his characters in a number of [[Sketch comedy|sketches]] were hits. Some of them include a [[flight attendant]] for \"[[Total Bastard Airlines]]\" who bids a dismissive \"Buh-Bye\" to each passenger upon disembarking; a receptionist for [[Dick Clark]] who, as a matter of policy, asks people indiscriminately, \"And you are?\"; and the sarcastic \"[[Hollywood Minute]]\" reporter who puts celebrities down by means of [[one-liner joke|one-liners]].  Other characters include Christy Henderson from the [[Gap Girls]] and Karl from the Karl's Video sketches. He also did impressions of various celebrities, including [[Brad Pitt]] and [[Michael J. Fox]]. According to interviews with Spade, most of the material that he wrote early in his time at SNL was given to [[Dana Carvey]] to perform on the show.\n\nOn December 9, 1995, Spade revived \"Hollywood Minute\" inside a segment called \"Spade in America\"; Spade joked, \"Look, children, it's a falling star.

He starred with fellow ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' cast member [[Chris Farley]] in two [[buddy comedy]] films, ''[[Tommy Boy]]'' (1995) and ''[[Black Sheep (1996 film)|Black Sheep]]'' (1996). The two were planning a third film together when Farley died of a drug overdose in 1997 at the age of 33. When Spade declined to attend Farley's funeral, rumors abounded that there had been a falling out between the two. Spade stated that their friendship had been under some tension, partly because of Farley's drug problem, but that he did not attend the funeral simply because he could not handle it emotionally.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Grow|first1=Kory|title=David Spade Explains Why He Didn't Attend Chris Farley's Funeral|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/news/david-spade-explains-why-he-didnt-attend-chris-farleys-funeral-20140430|website=Rolling Stone|accessdate=24 February 2018|date=April 30, 2014}}</ref>\n\nAlthough he received several offers to star in his own TV shows, he turned them down and joined the ensemble cast of [[Steven Levitan]]'s office sitcom ''[[Just Shoot Me!]],'' opposite [[Laura San Giacomo]] and [[George Segal]], which ran for seven seasons from 1997 to 2003. He played a sarcastic receptionist, [[Dennis Finch]].\n\nIn 2000, Spade provided the voice of Kuzco in Disney's [[buddy comedy]] film, ''[[The Emperor's New Groove]]'' (2000) and would later reprise the role in its direct-to-video sequel ''[[Kronk's New Groove]]'' (2005).\n\nWhile appearing on ''Just Shoot Me'', Spade had his first solo starring role as the title character in the 2001 film ''[[Joe Dirt]]'', which was a modest box office success. The film was co-written by Spade and Fred Wolf.\n\nSpade starred again in the 2003 film ''[[Dickie Roberts: Former Child Star]]'', again co-written by Spade and Wolf. It was the first of many films in which Spade has appeared that were produced by another ''Saturday Night Live'' castmate, [[Adam Sandler]]. Most notable among these are the films ''[[Grown Ups (film)|Grown Ups]]'' (2010) and ''[[Grown Ups 2]]'' (2013), both of which included Spade and Sandler among the lead roles, and both of which were major box office hits.\n\nSpade hosted both the [[Teen Choice Awards]] and [[SpikeTV]]'s [[Spike Video Game Awards|Video Game Awards]] in 2003. He voiced characters on several episodes of ''[[Beavis and Butt-head]]'' and produced his own TV series ''[[Sammy (TV series)|Sammy]]'' in 2000. From 2002 to 2006, Spade regularly appeared in commercials for [[Capital One]] (with [[Nate Torrence]]) where he played the employee of a fictional rival company whose policy toward honoring credit card rewards (and just about everything else) is \"always no.\" In 2004, he joined the cast of ''[[8 Simple Rules]],'' following the death of the sitcom's star, [[John Ritter]], for the show's third and final season.\n\nHe hosted the Comedy Central TV show ''[[The Showbiz Show with David Spade]]'' for three seasons, from September 2005 to October 2007.

While there, he became known for his brand of sarcasm, and his characters in a number of [[Sketch comedy|sketches]] were hits. Some of them include a [[flight attendant]] for \"[[Total Bastard Airlines]]\" who bids a dismissive \"Buh-Bye\" to each passenger upon disembarking; a receptionist for [[Dick Clark]] who, as a matter of policy, asks people indiscriminately, \"And you are?\"; and the sarcastic \"[[Hollywood Minute]]\" reporter who puts celebrities down by means of [[one-liner joke|one-liners]].  Other characters include Christy Henderson from the [[Gap Girls]] and Karl from the Karl's Video sketches. He also did impressions of various celebrities, including [[Brad Pitt]] and [[Michael J. Fox]]. According to interviews with Spade, most of the material that he wrote early in his time at SNL was given to [[Dana Carvey]] to perform on the show.\n\nOn December 9, 1995, Spade revived \"Hollywood Minute\" inside a segment called \"Spade in America\"; Spade joked, \"Look, children, it's a falling star.

He starred with fellow ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' cast member [[Chris Farley]] in two [[buddy comedy]] films, ''[[Tommy Boy]]'' (1995) and ''[[Black Sheep (1996 film)|Black Sheep]]'' (1996). The two were planning a third film together when Farley died of a drug overdose in 1997 at the age of 33. When Spade declined to attend Farley's funeral, rumors abounded that there had been a falling out between the two. Spade stated that their friendship had been under some tension, partly because of Farley's drug problem, but that he did not attend the funeral simply because he could not handle it emotionally.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Grow|first1=Kory|title=David Spade Explains Why He Didn't Attend Chris Farley's Funeral|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/news/david-spade-explains-why-he-didnt-attend-chris-farleys-funeral-20140430|website=Rolling Stone|accessdate=24 February 2018|date=April 30, 2014}}</ref>\n\nAlthough he received several offers to star in his own TV shows, he turned them down and joined the ensemble cast of [[Steven Levitan]]'s office sitcom ''[[Just Shoot Me!]],'' opposite [[Laura San Giacomo]] and [[George Segal]], which ran for seven seasons from 1997 to 2003. He played a sarcastic receptionist, [[Dennis Finch]].\n\nIn 2000, Spade provided the voice of Kuzco in Disney's [[buddy comedy]] film, ''[[The Emperor's New Groove]]'' (2000) and would later reprise the role in its direct-to-video sequel ''[[Kronk's New Groove]]'' (2005).\n\nWhile appearing on ''Just Shoot Me'', Spade had his first solo starring role as the title character in the 2001 film ''[[Joe Dirt]]'', which was a modest box office success. The film was co-written by Spade and Fred Wolf.\n\nSpade starred again in the 2003 film ''[[Dickie Roberts: Former Child Star]]'', again co-written by Spade and Wolf. It was the first of many films in which Spade has appeared that were produced by another ''Saturday Night Live'' castmate, [[Adam Sandler]]. Most notable among these are the films ''[[Grown Ups (film)|Grown Ups]]'' (2010) and ''[[Grown Ups 2]]'' (2013), both of which included Spade and Sandler among the lead roles, and both of which were major box office hits.\n\nSpade hosted both the [[Teen Choice Awards]] and [[SpikeTV]]'s [[Spike Video Game Awards|Video Game Awards]] in 2003. He voiced characters on several episodes of ''[[Beavis and Butt-head]]'' and produced his own TV series ''[[Sammy (TV series)|Sammy]]'' in 2000. From 2002 to 2006, Spade regularly appeared in commercials for [[Capital One]] (with [[Nate Torrence]]) where he played the employee of a fictional rival company whose policy toward honoring credit card rewards (and just about everything else) is \"always no.\" In 2004, he joined the cast of ''[[8 Simple Rules]],'' following the death of the sitcom's star, [[John Ritter]], for the show's third and final season.\n\nHe hosted the Comedy Central TV show ''[[The Showbiz Show with David Spade]]'' for three seasons, from September 2005 to October 2007. On the show, Spade made fun of Hollywood and celebrities in a manner similar to his old \"Hollywood Minute\" segment on ''SNL''.<ref>[https://archive.today/20070811085702/http://www.tvseriesfinale.com/2007/10/the_showbiz_show_with_david_spade_comedy_central_s.php The Showbiz Show with David Spade: Comedy Central Series Cancelled] , ''TVSeriesFinale.com''.
