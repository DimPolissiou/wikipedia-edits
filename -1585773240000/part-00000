During the 12th century a charter was granted allowing a market, and the building of [[St. Mary's Church, Watford|St Mary's Church]] began. The town grew partly due to travellers going to [[Berkhamsted Castle]] and the royal palace at [[Kings Langley]]. A [[mansion]] was built at [[Cassiobury House|Cassiobury]] in the 16th century. This was partly rebuilt in the 17th century and another [[country house]] was built at [[The Grove, Watford|The Grove]].\n\nThe [[Grand Junction Canal]] in 1798 and the [[London and Birmingham Railway]] in 1837 resulted in Watford's rapid growth, with paper-making mills such as [[John Dickinson Stationery|John Dickinson]] at Croxley, influencing the development of printing in the town. Two brewers, [[Benskins]] and [[Sedgwicks Brewery|Sedgwicks]], amalgamated and flourished in the town until their closure in the late 20th century. [[Hertfordshire County Council]] designates Watford to be a major sub-regional centre. Several head offices  are based in Watford.

[[Watford Borough Council]] is the [[local authority]] with the [[Mayor of Watford]] as its head; one of only 18 [[directly elected mayors in England and Wales]]. Watford elects one [[Member of parliament|MP]] for the [[Watford (UK Parliament constituency)|Watford constituency]].

In the 12th century the Abbey was granted a charter allowing it to hold a market here and the building of St Mary's Church began. The settlement's location helped it to grow, since as well as trade along this north-south through route it possessed good communications into the vale of [[St Albans]] to the east and into the Chiltern Hills along the valley of the [[River Chess]] to the west. The town grew modestly, assisted by travellers passing through to [[Berkhamsted Castle]] and the royal palace at [[Kings Langley]]. A big house was built at [[Cassiobury House|Cassiobury]] in the 16th century. This was partly rebuilt in the 17th century and another substantial house was built nearby at [[The Grove, Watford|The Grove]].

The [[Industrial Revolution]] brought the [[Grand Junction Canal]] (now [[Grand Union Canal]]) from 1798 and the [[London and Birmingham Railway]] from 1837, both located here for the same reasons the road had followed centuries before, seeking an easy gradient over the Chiltern Hills. The land-owning interests permitted the canal to follow closely by the river Gade, but the prospect of smoke-emitting [[steam train]]s drove them to ensure the railway gave a wide berth to the Cassiobury and Grove estates. Consequently, although the road and canal follow the easier valley route, the railway company was forced to build an expensive tunnel under [[Leavesden, Hertfordshire|Leavesden]] to the north of the town.\n[[File:Watford, The old railway station house - geograph.org.uk - 981561.jpg|thumb|left|St Albans Road railway station  (1837)]]\n[[Watford railway station (1837-1858)|Watford's original railway station]] opened in 1837 on the west side of St Albans Road, a small, single-storey red-brick building.

The canal allowed paper-making mills to be sited at Croxley. The [[John Dickinson Stationery|John Dickinson and Co.]] mill beside the canal manufactured the Croxley brand of fine quality paper.

It is derived from 'Caegshoe', which is believed to be the combination of 'caeg', a person's name, and 'hoe', meaning a spur of land. When the land was granted to Sir Richard Morrison in the 16th century, it was called 'Cayshobury', with 'bury' indicating a manor.<ref name=\"forsyth\"/><ref name=\"Page-Manors\"/>\n\n[[Cassiobury Park]] was formed from the grounds of [[Cassiobury House]] and consists of {{convert|190|acre|km2}} of open space. The house was demolished in 1927 and the Cassiobury Gates in 1970, for road widening. In July 2007, the park won a [[Green Flag Award]], which recognises the best green spaces in the country.<ref>[http://www.greenflagaward.org/park-summary/?park=477 Cassiobury Park], Green Flag Awards.</ref> There is a children's play area, which includes a paddling pool, play equipment, a bouncy castle, an ice cream van, a kiosk where one may buy food, and 10.25\" gauge miniature railway.

Mr Colbeck was a renowned local architect, and designed Cheslyn House; he and his wife created the original gardens. The Colbecks travelled extensively, and this is reflected in the range of unusual and exotic plants in the gardens. Since the space has been open to the public it has been further developed, with new features added such as the pond, rock garden, large herbaceous borders and aviary.\n\n===Woodside Park===\nAwarded Green Flag status since 2011, Woodside Playing Fields cover approximately 59 acres of playing fields, sports facilities and woodland.

district|borough]] in [[Hertfordshire]], England, {{convert|15|mi}} northwest of [[central London]].\n\nThe town developed on the [[River Colne, Hertfordshire|River Colne]] on land belonging to [[St Albans Abbey]] until the 16th century. During the 12th century a charter was granted allowing a market, and the building of [[St. Mary's Church, Watford|St Mary's Church]] began. The town grew partly due to travellers going to [[Berkhamsted Castle]] and the royal palace at [[Kings Langley]]. A [[mansion]] was built at [[Cassiobury House|Cassiobury]] in the 16th century. This was partly rebuilt in the 17th century and another [[country house]] was built at [[The Grove, Watford|The Grove]].\n\nThe [[Grand Junction Canal]] in 1798 and the [[London and Birmingham Railway]] in 1837 resulted in Watford's rapid growth, with paper-making mills such as [[John Dickinson Stationery|John Dickinson]] at Croxley, influencing the development of printing in the town. Two brewers, [[Benskins]] and [[Sedgwicks Brewery|Sedgwicks]], amalgamated and flourished in the town until their closure in the late 20th century. [[Hertfordshire County Council]] designates Watford to be a major sub-regional centre. Several head offices  are based in Watford.

The borough, which had 90,301 inhabitants at the time of the 2011 census, is separated from [[Greater London]] to the south by the parish of [[Watford Rural]] in the [[Three Rivers (district)|Three Rivers District]]. [[Watford Borough Council]] is the [[local authority]] with the [[Mayor of Watford]] as its head; one of only 18 [[directly elected mayors in England and Wales]]. Watford elects one [[Member of parliament|MP]] for the [[Watford (UK Parliament constituency)|Watford constituency]].

In the 12th century the Abbey was granted a charter allowing it to hold a market here and the building of St Mary's Church began. The settlement's location helped it to grow, since as well as trade along this north-south through route it possessed good communications into the vale of [[St Albans]] to the east and into the Chiltern Hills along the valley of the [[River Chess]] to the west. The town grew modestly, assisted by travellers passing through to [[Berkhamsted Castle]] and the royal palace at [[Kings Langley]]. A big house was built at [[Cassiobury House|Cassiobury]] in the 16th century. This was partly rebuilt in the 17th century and another substantial house was built nearby at [[The Grove, Watford|The Grove]].

The [[Industrial Revolution]] brought the [[Grand Junction Canal]] (now [[Grand Union Canal]]) from 1798 and the [[London and Birmingham Railway]] from 1837, both located here for the same reasons the road had followed centuries before, seeking an easy gradient over the Chiltern Hills. The land-owning interests permitted the canal to follow closely by the river Gade, but the prospect of smoke-emitting [[steam train]]s drove them to ensure the railway gave a wide berth to the Cassiobury and Grove estates.

Amnesty estimate that there are currently only 900 internally displaced Jumma families.<ref name=\"Amnesty International 2013\" /><ref name=\"Erueti ABC 2013\" />\n\n==Background==\nThe origin of the conflict in the Chittagong Hill Tracts dates back to the British rule. The British, at the end of the 19th century, reorganized the CHT. This resulted in the recognition of three tribal chiefs (rajas) in 1860, (b) enactment of the Chittagong Hill Tracts Frontier Police Regulations in 1881, authorizing a police force from among the hill peoples, and (c) enactment of the Chittagong Hill Tracts Regulations in 1900, giving them rights and autonomy. When [[Bangladesh]] was the [[East Pakistan|eastern wing]] of [[Pakistan]], widespread resentment occurred over the displacement of as many as 100,000 of the native peoples due to the construction of the [[Kaptai Dam]] in 1962. The displaced did not receive compensation from the government and many thousands fled to [[India]]. After the [[Bangladesh Liberation War|creation of Bangladesh]] in 1971, representatives of the Chittagong Hill Tracts who was the [[Chakma people|Chakma]] politician [[Manabendra Narayan Larma]] sought autonomy and recognition of the rights of the peoples of the region. Larma and other Hill Tracts representatives protested the draft of the [[Constitution of Bangladesh]].

Most common form of killing occurs when indigenous people are detained and beaten in numerous Bangladeshi military, intelligence and police installations in CHT. Killings also occur when Bangladeshi armed forces randomly open fire at villagers. Bangladesh government provides weapons to settlers and they are also responsible for killing of indigenous people. The settlers often join the armed forces in raid of indigenous villages and involved in killing indigenous people by firearms or crude sharp weapons. The settlers also take part in communal riots instigated by the Bangladeshi armed forces and kill indigenous people.<ref>{{cite book |title=Bangladesh Unlawful Killings And Torture In The Chittagong Hill Tracts |date=1986 |publisher=Amnesty International |location=United Kingdom |isbn=0862101107 |pages=10-11}}</ref>\n\n===Rapes===\n\nBetween 1981 and 1994 it is estimated that 2,500 Jumma women had been raped by Bangladesh armed forces and in 1995 it was estimated that of over 94% of rapes between 1991 and 1993 had been by the Bangladesh armed forces, with allegations that 80% of those raped were Jumma. According to Kabita Chakma and Glen Hill, the sexual abuse against Jumma women is endemic.<ref name=\"Chakma 2013 p144\" /> During the conflict, the security forces had used a deliberate strategy of rape, torture, arbitrary arrests, mass imprisonment and kidnapping against the Jumma.<ref name=\"Begovich 2007 p169\" />\n\nBangladesh government tacitly encourages armed forces  and settlers to rape indigenous girls and women as a tool to expel them from their traditional land. As a result thousands of indigenous girls and women were raped by armed forces and settlers since independence of Bangladesh in 1971.\n\nBangladeshi armed forces in league with the settlers raid indigenous villages, separate men from women and rape indigenous girls and women. Bangladeshi armed forces and settlers often rape indigenous girls and women in front of their husbands and parents. Bangladeshi armed forces and settlers also target indigenous girls and women when they go to markets, schools or go to fetch water or fire wood.\n\n===Detention and Torture===\n\nIndigenous people are detained without warrant and often tortured in the custody of Bangladeshi armed forces. Bangladeshi armed forces detain and torture indigenous people on mere suspicion of being members of the [[Shanti Bahini]] or helping the [[Shanti Bahini]]. There were numerous check posts on highways and ferries in [[Chittagong Hill Tracts]]. <ref>{{cite book |title=Bangladesh Unlawful Killings And Torture In The Chittagong Hill Tracts |date=1986 |publisher=Amnesty International |location=United Kingdom |isbn=0862101107 |pages=26-30}}</ref>\n\nBangladeshi armed forces interrogate and detain indigenous travellers from this check posts. Bangladeshi armed forces raid indigenous villages and torture indigenous people on suspicion of sheltering and feeding the [[Shanti Bahini]].\n\nIndigenous people who are detained in military camps and cantonments are subjected to severe beating, electrocution, water boarding, hanging upside down, shoving burning cigarettes on bodies etc. Prisoners are detained in pits and trenches. Bangladeshi soldiers sprinkle hot water on indigenous prisoners. Indigenous captives are then taken out for interrogation one at a time. Indigenous people are often tortured during interrogation.\n\n===Religious Persecution===\n\nBangladeshi armed forces and settlers often target Buddhist and Hindu temples when they raid indigenous villages. Destruction and desecration of Buddhist and Hindu temples are common occurrences in CHT. Bangladeshi armed forces and settlers often slaughter cows and goats in Buddhist and Hindu temples to desecrate the place of worship.<ref>{{cite book |title=Life is Not Ours: Land and Human Rights in the Chittagong Hill Tracts |date=1991 |publisher=The Chittagong Hill Tracts Commission |location=Netherlands |pages=87-100}}</ref>\n\nBangladeshi armed forces and settlers often humiliate and beat Buddhist monks and Hindu priests in front of the indigenous people to demean their faiths. Bangladeshi armed forces man handle Buddhist monks and Hindu priests at various check posts in CHT.\n\nBangladeshi armed forces and settlers often forcibly convert indigenous people to Islam as a way to escape from never ending persecution. The settlers abduct indigenous women and forcibly convert them to Islam for marrying.\n\n===Land Grab===\n\nSince vast majority of the indigenous people are farmers and cultivators, land is very important and only means of survival. The government's sponsored settlement in CHT dispossessed many indigenous people of their lands.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Chittagong Hill Tracts Militarization, Oppression and the Hill Tribes |date=1984 |publisher=Anti Slavery Society |location=United Kingdom |isbn=0900918195 |page=43}}</ref>\n\nOften Bangladeshi armed forces expel indigenous people from their villages by massacres, arsons and constant harassments. Bangladeshi armed forces then give emptied villages to the settlers. In many cases Bangladeshi armed forces built settlements near indigenous villages. The settlers then gradually encroach on the lands of indigenous people.\n\nAnother way to grab indigenous land is to build military camp on indigenous land with little or no compensation and then constantly harass the indigenous people by intimidation, extortion, interrogation, rape which forces indigenous people to leave the villages.\n\n===Recent Developments===\n\nThe accords of the peace treaty have yet to be fully implemented which has resulted in the region remaining heavily militarised and mass inward migration continuing. Human rights violations continue with arbitrary arrests, killing and rapes occurring and human rights activists are targeted for questioning and arrests.<ref name=\"Wessendorf 2009 pp12-23\" /> According to a report from the Asian Centre for Human Rights on 26 August 2003 the UPDF in conjunction with tribals planned and launched an attack on ten villages. Hundreds of people were displaced and it is estimated that ten women, some who were Jumma were raped. It was reported that a nine-month-old child was strangled after it was grabbed from its grandmother who the settlers raped.<ref name=\"Chakma 2003 p4\" />\n\nAs yet the Jumma peoples have not been given constitutional recognition and are referred to as \"backward segments of the population\"<ref name=\"Wessendorf 2011 p328\" />\n\n==Government reaction==\n[[File:Chittagong Hill Tracts locator map.svg|thumb|200px|right|A map of the Chittagong Hill Tracts.]]\nAt the outbreak of the insurgency, the Government of Bangladesh deployed the army to begin counter-insurgency operations. The then-[[President of Bangladesh]] [[Ziaur Rahman]] created a [[Chittagong Hill Tracts Development Board]] under an army general to address the socio-economic needs of the region, but the entity proved unpopular and became a source of antagonism and mistrust amongst the native people against the government.

The British, at the end of the 19th century, reorganized the CHT. This resulted in the recognition of three tribal chiefs (rajas) in 1860, (b) enactment of the Chittagong Hill Tracts Frontier Police Regulations in 1881, authorizing a police force from among the hill peoples, and (c) enactment of the Chittagong Hill Tracts Regulations in 1900, giving them rights and autonomy. when [[Bangladesh]] was the [[East Pakistan|eastern wing]] of [[Pakistan]]. Widespread resentment occurred over the displacement of as many as 100,000 of the native peoples due to the construction of the [[Kaptai Dam]] in 1962. The displaced did not receive compensation from the government and many thousands fled to [[India]]. After the [[Bangladesh Liberation War|creation of Bangladesh]] in 1971, representatives of the Chittagong Hill Tracts who was the [[Chakma people|Chakma]] politician [[Manabendra Narayan Larma]] sought autonomy and recognition of the rights of the peoples of the region. Larma and other Hill Tracts representatives protested the draft of the [[Constitution of Bangladesh]]. It did not recognise the ethnic identity and culture of the non-[[Bengali people|Bengali]] peoples of Bangladesh. The government policy recognised only the [[Culture of Bengal|Bengali culture]] and the [[Bengali language]], and designated all citizens of Bangladesh as Bengalis. In talks with a Chittagong Hill Tracts delegation led by Manabendra Narayan Larma, the country's founding leader [[Sheikh Mujibur Rahman]] expressed that the ethnic groups of the Hill Tracts as citizen of Bangladesh should have the Bengali identity.<ref name=\"F\">{{cite book |author=Nagendra K.

Most common form of killing occurs when indigenous people are detained and beaten in numerous Bangladeshi military, intelligence and police installations in CHT. Killings also occur when Bangladeshi armed forces randomly open fire at villagers. Bangladesh government provides weapons to settlers and they are also responsible for killing of indigenous people. The settlers often join the armed forces in raid of indigenous villages and involved in killing indigenous people by firearms or crude sharp weapons. The settlers also take part in communal riots instigated by the Bangladeshi armed forces and kill indigenous people.<ref>{{cite book |title=Bangladesh Unlawful Killings And Torture In The Chittagong Hill Tracts |date=1986 |publisher=Amnesty International |location=United Kingdom |isbn=0862101107 |pages=10-11}}</ref>\n\n===Rapes===\n\nBetween 1981 and 1994 it is estimated that 2,500 Jumma women had been raped by Bangladesh armed forces and in 1995 it was estimated that of over 94% of rapes between 1991 and 1993 had been by the Bangladesh armed forces, with allegations that 80% of those raped were Jumma. According to Kabita Chakma and Glen Hill, the sexual abuse against Jumma women is endemic.<ref name=\"Chakma 2013 p144\" /> During the conflict, the security forces had used a deliberate strategy of rape, torture, arbitrary arrests, mass imprisonment and kidnapping against the Jumma.<ref name=\"Begovich 2007 p169\" />\n\nBangladesh government tacitly encourages armed forces  and settlers to rape indigenous girls and women as a tool to expel them from their traditional land. As a result thousands of indigenous girls and women were raped by armed forces and settlers since independence of Bangladesh in 1971.\n\nBangladeshi armed forces in league with the settlers raid indigenous villages, separate men from women and rape indigenous girls and women. Bangladeshi armed forces and settlers often rape indigenous girls and women in front of their husbands and parents. Bangladeshi armed forces and settlers also target indigenous girls and women when they go to markets, schools or go to fetch water or fire wood.\n\n===Detention and Torture===\n\nIndigenous people are detained without warrant and often tortured in the custody of Bangladeshi armed forces. Bangladeshi armed forces detain and torture indigenous people on mere suspicion of being members of the [[Shanti Bahini]] or helping the [[Shanti Bahini]]. There were numerous check posts on highways and ferries in [[Chittagong Hill Tracts]]. <ref>{{cite book |title=Bangladesh Unlawful Killings And Torture In The Chittagong Hill Tracts |date=1986 |publisher=Amnesty International |location=United Kingdom |isbn=0862101107 |pages=26-30}}</ref>\n\nBangladeshi armed forces interrogate and detain indigenous travellers from this check posts. Bangladeshi armed forces raid indigenous villages and torture indigenous people on suspicion of sheltering and feeding the [[Shanti Bahini]].\n\nIndigenous people who are detained in military camps and cantonments are subjected to severe beating, electrocution, water boarding, hanging upside down, shoving burning cigarettes on bodies etc. Prisoners are detained in pits and trenches. Bangladeshi soldiers sprinkle hot water on indigenous prisoners. Indigenous captives are then taken out for interrogation one at a time. Indigenous people are often tortured during interrogation.\n\n===Religious Persecution===\n\nBangladeshi armed forces and settlers often target Buddhist and Hindu temples when they raid indigenous villages. Destruction and desecration of Buddhist and Hindu temples are common occurrences in CHT. Bangladeshi armed forces and settlers often slaughter cows and goats in Buddhist and Hindu temples to desecrate the place of worship.<ref>{{cite book |title=Life is Not Ours: Land and Human Rights in the Chittagong Hill Tracts |date=1991 |publisher=The Chittagong Hill Tracts Commission |location=Netherlands |pages=87-100}}</ref>\n\nBangladeshi armed forces and settlers often humiliate and beat Buddhist monks and Hindu priests in front of the indigenous people to demean their faiths. Bangladeshi armed forces man handle Buddhist monks and Hindu priests at various check posts in CHT.\n\nBangladeshi armed forces and settlers often forcibly convert indigenous people to Islam as a way to escape from never ending persecution. The settlers abduct indigenous women and forcibly convert them to Islam for marrying.\n\n===Land Grab===\n\nSince vast majority of the indigenous people are farmers and cultivators, land is very important and only means of survival. The government's sponsored settlement in CHT dispossessed many indigenous people of their lands.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Chittagong Hill Tracts Militarization, Oppression and the Hill Tribes |date=1984 |publisher=Anti Slavery Society |location=United Kingdom |isbn=0900918195 |page=43}}</ref>\n\nOften Bangladeshi armed forces expel indigenous people from their villages by massacres, arsons and constant harassments. Bangladeshi armed forces then give emptied villages to the settlers. In many cases Bangladeshi armed forces built settlements near indigenous villages. The settlers then gradually encroach on the lands of indigenous people.\n\nAnother way to grab indigenous land is to build military camp on indigenous land with little or no compensation and then constantly harass the indigenous people by intimidation, extortion, interrogation, rape which forces indigenous people to leave the villages.\n\n===Recent Developments===\n\nThe accords of the peace treaty have yet to be fully implemented which has resulted in the region remaining heavily militarised and mass inward migration continuing. Human rights violations continue with arbitrary arrests, killing and rapes occurring and human rights activists are targeted for questioning and arrests.<ref name=\"Wessendorf 2009 pp12-23\" /> According to a report from the Asian Centre for Human Rights on 26 August 2003 the UPDF in conjunction with tribals planned and launched an attack on ten villages. Hundreds of people were displaced and it is estimated that ten women, some who were Jumma were raped. It was reported that a nine-month-old child was strangled after it was grabbed from its grandmother who the settlers raped.<ref name=\"Chakma 2003 p4\" />\n\nAs yet the Jumma peoples have not been given constitutional recognition and are referred to as \"backward segments of the population\"<ref name=\"Wessendorf 2011 p328\" />\n\n==Government reaction==\n[[File:Chittagong Hill Tracts locator map.svg|thumb|200px|right|A map of the Chittagong Hill Tracts.]]\nAt the outbreak of the insurgency, the Government of Bangladesh deployed the army to begin counter-insurgency operations. The then-[[President of Bangladesh]] [[Ziaur Rahman]] created a [[Chittagong Hill Tracts Development Board]] under an army general to address the socio-economic needs of the region, but the entity proved unpopular and became a source of antagonism and mistrust amongst the native people against the government. The government failed to address the long-standing issue of the displacement of people, numbering an estimated 100,000 caused by the construction of the [[Kaptai Dam]] in 1962.<ref name=\"internal\">{{cite web\n|url=http://www.internal-displacement.org/idmc/website/countries.nsf/(httpEnvelopes)/C2EA848CB001371D802570B8005A719E?OpenDocument\n|title=The construction of the Kaptai dam uproots the indigenous population (1957\u20131963)\n|accessdate=1 February 2007\n|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120204190113/http://www.internal-displacement.org/idmc/website/countries.nsf/(httpEnvelopes)/C2EA848CB001371D802570B8005A719E?OpenDocument\n|archive-date=4 February 2012\n|url-status=dead\n}}</ref> Displaced peoples did not receive compensation and more than 40,000 Chakma tribals had fled to India.<ref name=\"internal\"/> In the 1980s, the government began settling Bengalis in the region, causing the eviction of many natives and a significant alteration of demographics.
