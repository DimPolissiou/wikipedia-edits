The creation of then-WWF writer [[Vince Russo]], Brawl for All resulted in a number of [[legit (professional wrestling)|legit]] injuries for WWF performers and was received negatively by some industry figures.\n\n==Inception==\nThroughout 1998, the WWF experienced a growth in roster size but due to limited amount of TV time a number of their more genuine \"tough guys\" were left without much to do. As a result, the idea for a [[legit (professional wrestling)|legit]] tough guy tournament was bandied about as a way to both utilize some of these men and capitalize on the recent interest in [[Toughman Contest]]s around the country.\n\nAccording to [[John Layfield|John \"Bradshaw\" Layfield]], [[Vince Russo]] came up with the idea when Layfield wanted to create a [[hardcore wrestling]] division in the WWF.

Whichever wrestler connected with the most punches per round scored 5 points. In addition, a clean takedown scored 5 points and a knockdown was worth 10. If a wrestler was knocked out (decided by an eight-count rather than a ten-count), the match ended. The matches were scored by ringside judges including [[Gorilla Monsoon]].\n\nAccording to [[Jim Cornette]], [[\"Dr. Death\" Steve Williams]] was the WWF's favorite to win the tournament, with the company looking towards a lucrative [[pay-per-view]] match between Williams and [[Stone Cold Steve Austin]];<ref name=\"Cornette\"/> [[Bob Holly]] claimed that Williams had already been paid the $100,000 prize money before his second round fight against Bart Gunn.<ref name=\"Holly\">Holly, Bob.

Bradshaw received $25,000.\n\nThe WWF roster at the time had two well-known former [[UFC]] fighters, [[Dan Severn]] and [[Ken Shamrock]]. Shamrock declined the opportunity to take part, while Severn defeated [[Charles Wright (wrestler)|The Godfather]] in the first round but then withdrew from the tournament, stating he had nothing to prove. In a radio interview, Severn asserted that the WWF at first had not allowed him or Shamrock to compete at all and that they removed Severn from the tournament after his first-round victory over [[Charles Wright (wrestler)|The Godfather]].<ref>{{Cite web\n| url = http://www.submissionradio.com/dan-severn-reveals-crazy-underground-fight-he-was-offered/\n| title = Dan Severn reveals Crazy Mexican underground fight he was offered\n| website = Submission Radio\n| access-date = 2016-02-28\n}}</ref> However, Steve Williams recalls Shamrock \"backing out\" and Severn withdrawing because of his \"frustration at the rules and the idea of having to wear boxing gloves\".<ref>Steve Williams, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=KKctAgAAQBAJ&pg=PT235&lpg=PT235&dq=%22i+recall+ken+shamrock+backing+out%22&source=bl&ots=owFvwj5c6F&sig=Y0uwxXq7eCXliak09NbMhddkDDI&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjkzIDX_ZvLAhXqK5oKHd6sC1oQ6AEIHDAA#v=onepage&q=%22i%20recall%20ken%20shamrock%20backing%20out%22&f=false How Dr. Death Became Dr. Life]</ref>\n\nAlong with Williams, a number of other wrestlers sustained legit injuries during the tournament. The Godfather was injured,<ref name=\"Cornette\"/> and [[Steve Blackman]] and [[Road Warrior Hawk]] were unable to work in usual WWF capacities for a while after. [[Savio Vega]] aggravated an old arm injury and would never work for the WWF again. [[Achim Albrecht|Brakkus]] sustained injuries to his knee and shoulder that led him to retire in 1999.\n\n==Reception and legacy==\nFans in attendance instantly voiced their disapproval of the tournament, with chants of \"Boring!\" and \"We want wrestling!\" audible during the fights.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Martin|first=Fin|journal=[[Power Slam]]|title=What's Going Down|publisher=SW Publishing|date=July 1998|pages=5}}</ref>\n\nThen-WWF official [[Jim Cornette]] has described the tournament as \"the stupidest thing that the WWF has ever done\". He argued that the WWF misjudged the appeal that legitimate fighting would have to their audience, considering that the WWF had promoted the idea that their matches were merely entertainment. Furthermore, because the fighters were trained to work professional wrestling matches and not to fight, they risked both injury and the possibility that a defeat would hurt their marketability. Cornette also criticized the WWF for failing to use the tournament to promote Bart Gunn as a new star wrestler.<ref name=\"Cornette\"/>\n\nIn the WWE documentary ''The Attitude Era'', [[Jim Ross]] stated that it was \"one of those ideas that looked really cool on paper\", but John \"Bradshaw\" Layfield added that the execution was \"a bad idea\". Layfield also stated that \"nobody knew Bart Gunn was ''that'' good.\"<ref name=\"AttitudeDVD\">{{cite video|date=May 22, 2013|title=WWE: The Attitude Era|medium=DVD|publisher=[[WWE Home Video]]}}</ref>\n\n==Aftermath==\nImmediately prior to the Brawl for All, Holly (as \"Bombastic Bob\") and Gunn (as \"Bodacious Bart\") had been a tag-team called [[The Midnight Express (professional wrestling)|The New Midnight Express]] with Jim Cornette as their manager and as The New Midnight Express they had won the [[NWA World Tag Team Championship]] after defeating [[The Headbangers]] on an episode of ''Raw''. After winning the tournament, Bart Gunn feuded with both Bob Holly, now known as [[Hardcore Holly]],<ref>http://www.pwwew.net/tv/raw/990215.htm</ref> and Steve Williams, both angry at having been beaten in the tournament, the latter masking himself and pushing Gunn off a stage.\n\nGunn was later matched against professional boxer [[Eric Esch|Butterbean]] at [[WrestleMania XV]] in a regular boxing match; Gunn was knocked out 35 seconds into the bout and was fired by the WWF afterward. Jim Cornette was critical of Gunn being placed in a match with a pro boxer.<ref name=\"Cornette\"/> Bob Holly claimed that Gunn's inevitable loss to Butterbean was a punishment for defeating the company's desired winner, Steve Williams.<ref name=\"Holly\"/>\n\nMost of the other participants departed the company within a year after the tournament; [[Steve Blackman]] and [[Charles Wright (wrestler)|The Godfather]] left in 2002 and [[Bob Holly]] stayed with the company (now renamed WWE) until 2009.\n\n==Brawl for All tournament bracket==\n<onlyinclude><small>KO - knockout; TKO - technical knockout; Pts - points; Dec - referee's/judge's decision</small>\n{{16TeamBracket\n| RD1-seed01=Raw\n| RD1-seed02=6/29\n| RD1-team01='''[[Steve Blackman]]''' <sup>'''1'''</sup>\n| RD1-team02=[[Marc Mero]]\n| RD1-score01=Dec\n| RD1-score02=\n| RD1-seed03=Raw\n| RD1-seed04=6/29\n| RD1-team03=[[Mark Canterbury]]\n| RD1-team04='''[[John Layfield|Bradshaw]]'''\n| RD1-score03=\n| RD1-score04=Pts\n| RD1-seed05=Raw\n| RD1-seed06=7/6\n| RD1-team05=[[Achim Albrecht|Brakkus]]\n| RD1-team06='''[[Savio Vega]]'''\n| RD1-score05=\n| RD1-score06=Pts\n| RD1-seed07=Raw\n| RD1-seed08=7/6\n| RD1-team07=[[Darren Drozdov|Darren \"Droz\" Drozdov]] <sup>'''2'''</sup>\n| RD1-team08=[[Road Warrior Hawk]]\n| RD1-score07=Draw\n| RD1-score08=Draw\n| RD1-seed09=Raw\n| RD1-seed10=7/13\n| RD1-team09='''[[Mike Plotcheck|Bart Gunn]]'''\n| RD1-team10=[[Bob Holly]]\n| RD1-score09=Dec\n| RD1-score10=\n| RD1-seed11=Raw\n| RD1-seed12=7/20\n| RD1-team11=[[Carl Ouellet|Quebecer Pierre]]\n| RD1-team12='''[[\"Dr. Death\" Steve Williams|Steve Williams]]'''\n| RD1-score11=\n| RD1-score12=TKO\n| RD1-seed13=Raw\n| RD1-seed14=7/13\n| RD1-team13=[[Charles Wright (wrestler)|The Godfather]]\n| RD1-team14='''[[Dan Severn]]''' <sup>'''3'''</sup>\n| RD1-score13=\n| RD1-score14=Pts\n| RD1-seed15=Raw\n| RD1-seed16=7/20\n| RD1-team15=[[Harris Brothers|8-Ball]]\n| RD1-team16='''[[2 Cold Scorpio|Scorpio]]'''\n| RD1-score15=\n| RD1-score16=Pts\n| RD2-seed01=Raw\n| RD2-seed02=8/10\n| RD2-team01=Marc Mero\n| RD2-team02='''Bradshaw'''\n| RD2-score01=\n| RD2-score02=Pts\n| RD2-seed03=Raw\n| RD2-seed04=8/10\n| RD2-team03=Savio Vega\n| RD2-team04='''Darren \"Droz\" Drozdov'''\n| RD2-score03=\n| RD2-score04=Pts\n| RD2-seed05=Raw\n| RD2-seed06=7/27\n| RD2-team05='''Bart Gunn'''\n| RD2-team06=Steve Williams\n| RD2-score05=KO\n| RD2-score06=\n| RD2-seed07=Raw\n| RD2-seed08=8/3\n| RD2-team07='''The Godfather'''\n| RD2-team08=Scorpio\n| RD2-score07=Pts\n| RD2-score08=\n| RD3-seed01=Raw\n| RD3-seed02=8/17\n| RD3-team01='''Bradshaw'''\n| RD3-team02=Darren \"Droz\" Drozdov\n| RD3-score01=Pts\n| RD3-score02=\n| RD3-seed03=Raw\n| RD3-seed04=8/17\n| RD3-team03='''Bart Gunn'''\n| RD3-team04=The Godfather\n| RD3-score03=KO\n| RD3-score04=\n| RD4-seed01=Raw\n| RD4-seed02=8/24\n| RD4-team01=Bradshaw\n| RD4-team02='''Bart Gunn'''\n| RD4-score01=\n| RD4-score02=KO\n}}\n\n<sup>1</sup> Steve Blackman won the bout, but was forced to withdraw due to an injury sustained in training.

In a radio interview, Severn asserted that the WWF at first had not allowed him or Shamrock to compete at all and that they removed Severn from the tournament after his first-round victory over [[Charles Wright (wrestler)|The Godfather]].<ref>{{Cite web\n| url = http://www.submissionradio.com/dan-severn-reveals-crazy-underground-fight-he-was-offered/\n| title = Dan Severn reveals Crazy Mexican underground fight he was offered\n| website = Submission Radio\n| access-date = 2016-02-28\n}}</ref> However, Steve Williams recalls Shamrock \"backing out\" and Severn withdrawing because of his \"frustration at the rules and the idea of having to wear boxing gloves\".<ref>Steve Williams, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=KKctAgAAQBAJ&pg=PT235&lpg=PT235&dq=%22i+recall+ken+shamrock+backing+out%22&source=bl&ots=owFvwj5c6F&sig=Y0uwxXq7eCXliak09NbMhddkDDI&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjkzIDX_ZvLAhXqK5oKHd6sC1oQ6AEIHDAA#v=onepage&q=%22i%20recall%20ken%20shamrock%20backing%20out%22&f=false How Dr. Death Became Dr. Life]</ref>\n\nAlong with Williams, a number of other wrestlers sustained legit injuries during the tournament. The Godfather was injured,<ref name=\"Cornette\"/> and [[Steve Blackman]] and [[Road Warrior Hawk]] were unable to work in usual WWF capacities for a while after. [[Savio Vega]] aggravated an old arm injury and would never work for the WWF again. [[Achim Albrecht|Brakkus]] sustained injuries to his knee and shoulder that led him to retire in 1999.\n\n==Reception and legacy==\nFans in attendance instantly voiced their disapproval of the tournament, with chants of \"Boring!\" and \"We want wrestling!\" audible during the fights.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Martin|first=Fin|journal=[[Power Slam]]|title=What's Going Down|publisher=SW Publishing|date=July 1998|pages=5}}</ref>\n\nThen-WWF official [[Jim Cornette]] has described the tournament as \"the stupidest thing that the WWF has ever done\". He argued that the WWF misjudged the appeal that legitimate fighting would have to their audience, considering that the WWF had promoted the idea that their matches were merely entertainment. Furthermore, because the fighters were trained to work professional wrestling matches and not to fight, they risked both injury and the possibility that a defeat would hurt their marketability. Cornette also criticized the WWF for failing to use the tournament to promote Bart Gunn as a new star wrestler.<ref name=\"Cornette\"/>\n\nIn the WWE documentary ''The Attitude Era'', [[Jim Ross]] stated that it was \"one of those ideas that looked really cool on paper\", but John \"Bradshaw\" Layfield added that the execution was \"a bad idea\". Layfield also stated that \"nobody knew Bart Gunn was ''that'' good.\"<ref name=\"AttitudeDVD\">{{cite video|date=May 22, 2013|title=WWE: The Attitude Era|medium=DVD|publisher=[[WWE Home Video]]}}</ref>\n\n==Aftermath==\nImmediately prior to the Brawl for All, Holly (as \"Bombastic Bob\") and Gunn (as \"Bodacious Bart\") had been a tag-team called [[The Midnight Express (professional wrestling)|The New Midnight Express]] with Jim Cornette as their manager and as The New Midnight Express they had won the [[NWA World Tag Team Championship]] after defeating [[The Headbangers]] on an episode of ''Raw''. After winning the tournament, Bart Gunn feuded with both Bob Holly, now known as [[Hardcore Holly]],<ref>http://www.pwwew.net/tv/raw/990215.htm</ref> and Steve Williams, both angry at having been beaten in the tournament, the latter masking himself and pushing Gunn off a stage.\n\nGunn was later matched against professional boxer [[Eric Esch|Butterbean]] at [[WrestleMania XV]] in a regular boxing match; Gunn was knocked out 35 seconds into the bout and was fired by the WWF afterward. Jim Cornette was critical of Gunn being placed in a match with a pro boxer.<ref name=\"Cornette\"/> Bob Holly claimed that Gunn's inevitable loss to Butterbean was a punishment for defeating the company's desired winner, Steve Williams.<ref name=\"Holly\"/>\n\nMost of the other participants departed the company within a year after the tournament; [[Steve Blackman]] and [[Charles Wright (wrestler)|The Godfather]] left in 2002 and [[Bob Holly]] stayed with the company (now renamed WWE) until 2009.\n\n==Brawl for All tournament bracket==\n<onlyinclude><small>KO - knockout; TKO - technical knockout; Pts - points; Dec - referee's/judge's decision</small>\n{{16TeamBracket\n| RD1-seed01=Raw\n| RD1-seed02=6/29\n| RD1-team01='''[[Steve Blackman]]''' <sup>'''1'''</sup>\n| RD1-team02=[[Marc Mero]]\n| RD1-score01=Dec\n| RD1-score02=\n| RD1-seed03=Raw\n| RD1-seed04=6/29\n| RD1-team03=[[Mark Canterbury]]\n| RD1-team04='''[[John Layfield|Bradshaw]]'''\n| RD1-score03=\n| RD1-score04=Pts\n| RD1-seed05=Raw\n| RD1-seed06=7/6\n| RD1-team05=[[Achim Albrecht|Brakkus]]\n| RD1-team06='''[[Savio Vega]]'''\n| RD1-score05=\n| RD1-score06=Pts\n| RD1-seed07=Raw\n| RD1-seed08=7/6\n| RD1-team07=[[Darren Drozdov|Darren \"Droz\" Drozdov]] <sup>'''2'''</sup>\n| RD1-team08=[[Road Warrior Hawk]]\n| RD1-score07=Draw\n| RD1-score08=Draw\n| RD1-seed09=Raw\n| RD1-seed10=7/13\n| RD1-team09='''[[Mike Plotcheck|Bart Gunn]]'''\n| RD1-team10=[[Bob Holly]]\n| RD1-score09=Dec\n| RD1-score10=\n| RD1-seed11=Raw\n| RD1-seed12=7/20\n| RD1-team11=[[Carl Ouellet|Quebecer Pierre]]\n| RD1-team12='''[[\"Dr. Death\" Steve Williams|Steve Williams]]'''\n| RD1-score11=\n| RD1-score12=TKO\n| RD1-seed13=Raw\n| RD1-seed14=7/13\n| RD1-team13=[[Charles Wright (wrestler)|The Godfather]]\n| RD1-team14='''[[Dan Severn]]''' <sup>'''3'''</sup>\n| RD1-score13=\n| RD1-score14=Pts\n| RD1-seed15=Raw\n| RD1-seed16=7/20\n| RD1-team15=[[Harris Brothers|8-Ball]]\n| RD1-team16='''[[2 Cold Scorpio|Scorpio]]'''\n| RD1-score15=\n| RD1-score16=Pts\n| RD2-seed01=Raw\n| RD2-seed02=8/10\n| RD2-team01=Marc Mero\n| RD2-team02='''Bradshaw'''\n| RD2-score01=\n| RD2-score02=Pts\n| RD2-seed03=Raw\n| RD2-seed04=8/10\n| RD2-team03=Savio Vega\n| RD2-team04='''Darren \"Droz\" Drozdov'''\n| RD2-score03=\n| RD2-score04=Pts\n| RD2-seed05=Raw\n| RD2-seed06=7/27\n| RD2-team05='''Bart Gunn'''\n| RD2-team06=Steve Williams\n| RD2-score05=KO\n| RD2-score06=\n| RD2-seed07=Raw\n| RD2-seed08=8/3\n| RD2-team07='''The Godfather'''\n| RD2-team08=Scorpio\n| RD2-score07=Pts\n| RD2-score08=\n| RD3-seed01=Raw\n| RD3-seed02=8/17\n| RD3-team01='''Bradshaw'''\n| RD3-team02=Darren \"Droz\" Drozdov\n| RD3-score01=Pts\n| RD3-score02=\n| RD3-seed03=Raw\n| RD3-seed04=8/17\n| RD3-team03='''Bart Gunn'''\n| RD3-team04=The Godfather\n| RD3-score03=KO\n| RD3-score04=\n| RD4-seed01=Raw\n| RD4-seed02=8/24\n| RD4-team01=Bradshaw\n| RD4-team02='''Bart Gunn'''\n| RD4-score01=\n| RD4-score02=KO\n}}\n\n<sup>1</sup> Steve Blackman won the bout, but was forced to withdraw due to an injury sustained in training.

Throughout the communities, many businesses flourished. The Wards, 3rd, 4th and 5th had many restaurants, theaters, clubs, boarding houses, carriage delivery services, millinery shops (hat shops), stationery shops, newspaper publishers, dry goods stores, banks-savings and loans, insurance companies, seamstresses and tailor shops just to name a few. There were two major office buildings that housed many African American businesses, the Pilgrims Building https://www.stoppingpoints.com/texas/sights.cgi?marker=Ancient+Order+of+Pilgrims&cnty=harris) and the Odd Fellows Building (https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/eeh10). The agricultural history included a host of farmers and ranchers.(Red Book of Houston,https://woodsononline.wordpress.com/2019/02/25/the-red-book-of-houston/ ) As a matter of fact one of the largest ranches (still owned by the original family-The Taylor-Stevenson Ranch, 100 acres-http://www.airfields-freeman.com/TX/Airfields_TX_HoustonS.htm) was home to Sky Ranch the African American airport/air transport service, started by Tuskeegee Airmen in the mid 1900s.  In the Early 1900's the community celebrated DeRoLoc which helped to promote the economic development of the community. This week long event was celebrated by an Agricultural/Industrial Exhibition, Ball, and Carnival. Many of the businesses benefited by all the people that attended from the region. The first Official DeRoLoc Event in Emancipation Park (Oldest park in Texas-donated by Freed Slaves) hosted 4,000 people (Fall 1901-some people say it was 1909), the event stopped in 1929 and was recently revived by a local business (NuWaters Co-op) in Houston.

Throughout the communities, many businesses flourished. The Wards, 3rd, 4th and 5th had many restaurants, theaters, clubs, boarding houses, carriage delivery services, millinery shops (hat shops), stationery shops, newspaper publishers, dry goods stores, banks-savings and loans, insurance companies, seamstresses and tailor shops just to name a few. There were two major office buildings that housed many African American businesses, the Pilgrims Building https://www.stoppingpoints.com/texas/sights.cgi?marker=Ancient+Order+of+Pilgrims&cnty=harris) and the Odd Fellows Building (https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/eeh10). The agricultural history included a host of farmers and ranchers.(Red Book of Houston,https://woodsononline.wordpress.com/2019/02/25/the-red-book-of-houston/ ) As a matter of fact one of the largest ranches (still owned by the original family-The Taylor-Stevenson Ranch, 100 acres-http://www.airfields-freeman.com/TX/Airfields_TX_HoustonS.htm) was home to Sky Ranch the African American airport/air transport service, started by Tuskeegee Airmen in the mid 1900s.  In the Early 1900's the community celebrated DeRoLoc which helped to promote the economic development of the community. This week long event was celebrated by an Agricultural/Industrial Exhibition, Ball, and Carnival. Many of the businesses benefited by all the people that attended from the region. The first Official DeRoLoc Event in Emancipation Park (Oldest park in Texas-donated by Freed Slaves) hosted 4,000 people (Fall 1901-some people say it was 1909), the event stopped in 1929 and was recently revived by a local business (NuWaters Co-op) in Houston. In Acres homes, there was the first African American Bus Company that made many runs to/from downtown Houston, to Acres homes providing transportation to many African Americans.
