There is no single set of policies regarded as conservative because the meaning of conservatism depends on what is considered traditional in a given place and time. Thus conservatives from different parts of the world\u2014each upholding their respective traditions\u2014may disagree on a wide range of issues. [[Edmund Burke]], an 18th-century politician who opposed the French Revolution, but supported the [[American Revolution]], is credited as one of the main theorists of [[conservatism in the United Kingdom|conservatism in Great Britain in the 1790s]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Frank O'Gorman|title=Edmund Burke: His Political Philosophy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U-reNJAnv1oC&pg=PA171|year=2003|publisher=Routledge|page=171|isbn=978-0-415-32684-1}}</ref>\n\nAccording to [[Quintin Hogg, Baron Hailsham of St Marylebone|Quintin Hogg]], the chairman of the British [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] in 1959: \"Conservatism is not so much a philosophy as an attitude, a constant force, performing a timeless function in the development of a free society, and corresponding to a deep and permanent requirement of human nature itself\".<ref>{{cite book|author=Quintin Hogg Baron Hailsham of St. Marylebone|title=The Conservative Case|url=https://www.google.com/search?q=%22+attitude,+a+constant+force,+performing+a+timeless+function+in+the+development+of+a+free+society,+and+corresponding+to+a+deep+and+permanent+requirement+of+human+nature+itself%22|year=1959|publisher=Penguin Books}}</ref>\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n== Forms ==\n=== Liberal conservatism ===\n{{main|Liberal conservatism}}\n[[Liberal conservatism]] incorporates the [[classical liberal]] view of minimal government intervention in the economy. Individuals should be free to participate in the market and generate wealth without government interference.{{sfn|McAnulla|2006|p=71}} However, individuals cannot be thoroughly depended on to act responsibly in other spheres of life, therefore liberal conservatives believe that a strong state is necessary to ensure law and order and social institutions are needed to nurture a sense of duty and responsibility to the nation.{{sfn|McAnulla|2006|p=71}} Liberal conservatism is a variant of conservatism that is strongly influenced by [[Liberalism|liberal]] stances.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xGNRRwkZFysC&pg=PA109|title=Analyzing Politics|last=Grigsby|first=Ellen|publisher=[[Cengage Learning]]|year=2008|isbn=978-0-495-50112-1|location=|pages=108\u2013109, 112, 347|quote=|via=}}</ref>\n\nAs these latter two terms have had different meanings over time and across countries, liberal conservatism also has a wide variety of meanings. Historically, the term often referred to the combination of [[economic liberalism]], which champions ''[[laissez-faire]]'' markets, with the classical conservatism concern for established [[tradition]], respect for authority and religious values. It contrasted itself with [[classical liberalism]], which supported [[freedom for the individual]] in both the economic and social spheres.\n\nOver time, the general conservative ideology in many countries adopted economic liberal arguments and the term liberal conservatism was replaced with conservatism. This is also the case in countries where liberal economic ideas have been the tradition such as the United States and are thus considered conservative. In other countries where liberal conservative movements have entered the political mainstream, such as [[Italy]] and [[Spain]], the terms liberal and conservative may be synonymous. The liberal conservative tradition in the United States combines the economic [[individualism]] of the classical liberals with a [[Burkean]] form of conservatism (which has also become part of the [[American conservative]] tradition, such as in the writings of [[Russell Kirk]]).\n\nA secondary meaning for the term liberal conservatism that has developed in [[Europe]] is a combination of more modern conservative (less traditionalist) views with those of [[social liberalism]]. This has developed as an opposition to the more [[collectivist]] views of [[socialism]]. Often this involves stressing what are now conservative views of [[free market]] economics and belief in individual responsibility, with social liberal views on defence of [[civil rights]], [[environmentalism]] and support for a limited [[welfare state]]. In continental Europe, this is sometimes also translated into English as social conservatism.\n\n=== Conservative liberalism ===\n{{main|Conservative liberalism}}\n[[Conservative liberalism]] is a variant of liberalism that combines liberal values and policies with conservative stances.<ref>{{in lang|fr}} [http://www.ipolitique.fr/liberalisme-conservateur.htm Ipolitique.fr] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090319053712/http://www.ipolitique.fr/liberalisme-conservateur.htm |date=March 19, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.parties-and-elections.de/contents.html|title=parties-and-elections.de}}</ref><ref name=\"Mair\">{{Cite book|title=Representative Government in Europe|last=Gallagher|first=M.|last2=Laver|first2=M.|last3=Mair|first3=P.|year=|isbn=|location=|page=221|quote=|author-link=Michael Gallagher (academic)|author-link3=Peter Mair|via=}}</ref> The roots of conservative liberalism are found at the beginning of the [[History of liberal thought|history of liberalism]].

They generally differ from [[Paleoconservatism|paleoconservatives]], in that they favor more [[liberty|personal]] and [[economic freedom]].\n\n[[Agorist]]s such as [[Samuel Edward Konkin III]] labeled libertarian conservatism [[right-libertarianism]].<ref name=\"nlm\">{{cite web|title=New Libertarian Manifesto |url=http://agorism.info/NewLibertarianManifesto.pdf |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120223021118/http://www.agorism.info/NewLibertarianManifesto.pdf |archivedate=February 23, 2012}}</ref><ref name=\"int\">{{cite web|title=Interview With Samuel Edward Konkin III|url=http://www.spaz.org/~dan/individualist-anarchist/software/konkin-interview.html}}</ref>\n\nIn contrast to paleoconservatives, libertarian conservatives support strict ''laissez-faire'' policies such as [[free trade]], opposition to any national bank and opposition to [[regulations|business regulations]]. They are vehemently opposed to [[environmental regulation]]s, [[corporate welfare]], [[subsidies]] and other areas of economic intervention.\n\nMany conservatives, especially in the United States, believe that the government should not play a major role in regulating business and managing the economy. They typically oppose efforts to charge high tax rates and to redistribute income to assist the poor. Such efforts, they argue, do not properly reward people who have earned their money through hard work.\n\n=== Fiscal conservatism ===\n{{main|Fiscal conservatism}}\n[[File:TeaPartyByFreedomFan.JPG|thumb|2009 [[Taxpayer March on Washington]] as conservative protesters walk down [[Pennsylvania Avenue (Washington, D.C.)|Pennsylvania Avenue]], Washington, D.

The claim of the citizen is prior in time, paramount in title, superior in equity. The fortunes of individuals, whether possessed by acquisition or by descent or in virtue of a participation in the goods of some community, were no part of the creditor's security, expressed or implied...[T]he public, whether represented by a monarch or by a senate, can pledge nothing but the public estate; and it can have no public estate except in what it derives from a just and proportioned imposition upon the citizens at large.</blockquote>\n\n=== National and traditional conservatism ===\n{{main|National conservatism|Traditional conservatism}}\n[[File:Gianfranco Fini 2004.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Gianfranco Fini]], former President of the Italian [[Chamber of Deputies (Italy)|Chamber of Deputies]], in 2004]]\n[[National conservatism]] is a political term used primarily in Europe to describe a variant of conservatism which concentrates more on national interests than standard conservatism as well as upholding cultural and ethnic identity,<ref>{{cite book|title=Dictionary Of Public Administration|last=Mandal|first=V.C.|year=2007|publisher=Sarup & Sons|location=|isbn=978-81-7625-784-8|page=[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_Hs0xJORVIHwC/page/n312 306]|url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_Hs0xJORVIHwC|quote=National conservatism -inpublisher:icon.|accessdate=}}</ref> while not being outspokenly [[Nationalism|nationalist]] or supporting a [[Far-right politics|far-right]] approach.<ref>Wilson, Jason (August 23, 2016).

As such, national conservatives can be distinguished from economic conservatives, for whom free market economic policies, [[deregulation]] and fiscal conservatism are the main priorities. Some commentators have identified a growing gap between national and economic conservatism: \"[M]ost parties of the Right [today] are run by economic conservatives who, in varying degrees, have marginalized social, cultural, and national conservatives\".<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20041121224135/http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1282/is_n12_v49/ai_19559422 National questions \u2013 conservatives fragmenting as liberals unite], National Review, June 30, 1997</ref> National conservatism is also related to [[traditionalist conservatism]].\n\nTraditionalist conservatism is a political philosophy emphasizing the need for the principles of [[natural law]] and transcendent moral order, [[tradition]], [[hierarchy]] and [[organic unity]], [[agrarianism]], [[classicism]] and [[high culture]] as well as the intersecting spheres of loyalty.<ref>Frohnen, Bruce, Jeremy Beer, and Jeffrey O.

Social conservatives may believe that society is built upon a fragile network of relationships which need to be upheld through duty, traditional values and established institutions;{{sfn|Heywood|2017|p=69}} and that the government has a role in encouraging or enforcing traditional values or behaviours. A social conservative wants to preserve traditional morality and social mores, often by opposing what they consider radical policies or [[social engineering (political science)|social engineering]].

Since it is consistent with principles such as [[Organic unity|organicism]], [[hierarchy]] and [[duty]], it can be seen as an outgrowth of [[traditional conservatism]].

He reports:\n<blockquote>Conservative or rightist extremist movements have arisen at different periods in modern history, ranging from the [[Mikl\u00f3s Horthy|Horthyites]] in Hungary, the [[Engelbert Dollfuss|Christian Social Party of Dollfuss in Austria]], ''[[Der Stahlhelm, Bund der Frontsoldaten|Der Stahlhelm]]'' and other nationalists in pre-Hitler Germany, and [[Ant\u00f3nio de Oliveira Salazar|Salazar in Portugal]], to the pre-1966 Gaullist movements and the monarchists in contemporary France and Italy. The right extremists are conservative, not revolutionary. They seek to change political institutions in order to preserve or restore cultural and economic ones, while extremists of the centre and left seek to use political means for cultural and social revolution. The ideal of the right extremist is not a totalitarian ruler, but a monarch, or a traditionalist who acts like one. Many such movements in Spain, Austria, Hungary, Germany, and Italy-have been explicitly monarchist... The supporters of these movements differ from those of the centrists, tending to be wealthier, and more religious, which is more important in terms of a potential for mass support.<ref>Seymour M. Lipset, \"Social Stratification and 'Right-Wing Extremism'\" ''British Journal of Sociology'' 10#4 (1959), pp. 346-382 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/587800 on-line]</ref></blockquote>\n\n== History ==\n=== Development of Western conservatism ===\n==== United Kingdom ====\n{{main|Conservatism in the United Kingdom}}\n{{Toryism|related}}\nIn Great Britain, conservative ideas (though not yet called that) emerged in the [[Tory]] movement during the [[Restoration (England)|Restoration]] period (1660\u20131688). Toryism supported a hierarchical society with a monarch who ruled by [[Divine right of kings|divine right]]. [[Tories (British political party)|Tories]] opposed the idea that sovereignty derived from the people and rejected the authority of parliament and freedom of religion. [[Robert Filmer]]'s ''Patriarcha: or the Natural Power of Kings'' (published posthumously in 1680, but written before the [[English Civil War]] of 1642\u20131651) became accepted as the statement of their doctrine. However, the [[Glorious Revolution]] of 1688 destroyed this principle to some degree by establishing a constitutional government in England, leading to the hegemony of the Tory-opposed [[Whigs (British political party)|Whig]] ideology. Faced with defeat, the Tories reformed their movement, now holding that sovereignty was vested in the three estates of Crown, Lords and Commons<ref>{{harvnb|Eccleshall|1990|pp=ix, 21}}</ref> rather than solely in the Crown. Toryism became marginalized during the long period of Whig ascendancy in the 18th century.\n\nConservatives typically see [[Richard Hooker]] (1554\u20131600) as the founding father of conservatism, along with the [[George Savile, 1st Marquess of Halifax|Marquess of Halifax]] (1633\u20131695), [[David Hume]] (1711\u20131776) and [[Edmund Burke]] (1729\u20131797).

He supported the [[American Revolution]] of 1765\u20131783, but abhorred the violence of the [[French Revolution]] (1789\u20131799). He accepted the liberal ideals of private property and the economics of [[Adam Smith]] (1723\u20131790), but thought that economics should remain subordinate to the conservative social ethic, that capitalism should be subordinate to the medieval social tradition and that the business class should be subordinate to [[aristocracy]]. He insisted on standards of honor derived from the medieval aristocratic tradition and saw the aristocracy as the nation's natural leaders.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Conservative Illusion|last=Auerbach|year=1959|isbn=|location=|pages=37\u201340|quote=|via=}}</ref> That meant limits on the powers of the Crown, since he found the institutions of Parliament to be better informed than commissions appointed by the executive.

Despite their influence on future conservative thought, none of these early contributors were explicitly involved in Tory politics. Hooker lived in the 16th century, long before the advent of [[toryism]], whilst Hume was an apolitical philosopher and Halifax similarly politically independent. Burke described himself as a Whig.\n\n===== Revival =====\n[[File:EdmundBurke1771.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Edmund Burke]] (1729\u20131797)]]\nShortly after Burke's death in 1797, conservatism revived as a mainstream political force as the Whigs suffered a series of internal divisions. This new generation of conservatives derived their politics not from Burke, but from his predecessor, the [[Henry St John, 1st Viscount Bolingbroke|Viscount Bolingbroke]] (1678\u20131751), who was a Jacobite and traditional Tory, lacking Burke's sympathies for Whiggish policies such as [[Catholic emancipation]] and [[American Revolution|American independence]] (famously attacked by [[Samuel Johnson]] in \"Taxation No Tyranny\"). In the first half of the 19th century, many newspapers, magazines, and journals promoted loyalist or right-wing attitudes in religion, politics and international affairs. Burke was seldom mentioned, but [[William Pitt the Younger]] (1759\u20131806) became a conspicuous hero. The most prominent journals included ''The Quarterly Review'', founded in 1809 as a counterweight to the Whigs' ''Edinburgh Review'' and the even more conservative ''Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine''. Sack finds that the ''Quarterly Review'' promoted a balanced Canningite toryism as it was neutral on Catholic emancipation and only mildly critical of Nonconformist Dissent; it opposed slavery and supported the current poor laws; and it was \"aggressively imperialist\". The [[high-church]] clergy of the Church of England read the ''[[Orthodox Churchman's Magazine]]'' which was equally hostile to Jewish, Catholic, [[Jacobin]], [[Methodist]] and [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] spokesmen. Anchoring the ultra Tories, ''Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine'' stood firmly against Catholic emancipation and favoured slavery, cheap money, mercantilism, the [[Navigation Acts]] and the [[Holy Alliance]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Sack|first=J.

The effect was to significantly strengthen conservatism as a grassroots political force. Conservatism no longer was the philosophical defense of the landed aristocracy, but had been refreshed into redefining its commitment to the ideals of order, both secular and religious, expanding imperialism, strengthened monarchy and a more generous vision of the welfare state as opposed to the punitive vision of the Whigs and liberals.<ref>Gregory Claeys, \"Political Thought\", in Chris Williams, ed., ''A Companion to 19th-Century Britain'' (2006). p. 195</ref> As early as 1835, Disraeli attacked the Whigs and utilitarians as slavishly devoted to an industrial oligarchy, while he described his fellow Tories as the only \"really democratic party of England\" and devoted to the interests of the whole people.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Charles Richmond|author2=Paul Smith|title=The Self-Fashioning of Disraeli, 1818\u20131851|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jnF3IRJbKR8C&pg=PA162|year=1998|publisher=Cambridge UP|page=162|isbn=978-0-521-49729-9}}</ref> Nevertheless, inside the party there was a tension between the growing numbers of wealthy businessmen on the one side and the aristocracy and rural gentry on the other.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Conservative Illusion|last=Auerbach|year=1959|isbn=|location=|pages=39\u201340|quote=|via=}}</ref> The aristocracy gained strength as businessmen discovered they could use their wealth to buy a peerage and a country estate.\n\nAlthough conservatives opposed attempts to allow greater representation of the middle class in parliament, they conceded that [[electoral reform]] could not be reversed and promised to support further reforms so long as they did not erode the institutions of church and state. These new principles were presented in the [[Tamworth Manifesto]] of 1834, which historians regard as the basic statement of the beliefs of the new Conservative Party.<ref>{{harvnb|Eccleshall|1990|pp=79\u201380}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Robert Peel Portrait.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Robert Peel]] (1788\u20131850)]]\nSome conservatives lamented the passing of a pastoral world where the ethos of ''[[noblesse oblige]]'' had promoted respect from the lower classes.

This marked the beginning of the transformation of British conservatism from [[High Tory]] reactionism towards a more modern form based on \"conservation\". The party became known as the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] as a result, a name it has retained to this day. However, Peel would also be the root of a split in the party between the traditional Tories (led by the [[Edward Smith-Stanley, 14th Earl of Derby|Earl of Derby]] and [[Benjamin Disraeli]]) and the \"Peelites\" (led first by Peel himself, then by the [[George Hamilton-Gordon, 4th Earl of Aberdeen|Earl of Aberdeen]]). The split occurred in 1846 over the issue of [[free trade]], which Peel supported, versus [[protectionism]], supported by Derby. The majority of the party sided with Derby whilst about a third split away, eventually merging with the [[Whigs (British political party)|Whigs]] and the [[radicalism (politics)|radicals]] to form the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]]. Despite the split, the mainstream Conservative Party accepted the doctrine of free trade in 1852.\n\nIn the second half of the 19th century, the Liberal Party faced political schisms, especially over [[History of Ireland|Irish]] [[Irish Parliamentary Party|Home Rule]]. Leader [[William Gladstone]] (himself a former Peelite) sought to give Ireland a degree of autonomy, a move that elements in both the left and right-wings of his party opposed. These split off to become the [[Liberal Unionist Party|Liberal Unionists]] (led by [[Joseph Chamberlain]]), forming a coalition with the Conservatives before merging with them in 1912. The Liberal Unionist influence dragged the Conservative Party towards the left as Conservative governments passing a number of progressive reforms at the turn of the 20th century. By the late 19th century, the traditional business supporters of the Liberal Party had joined the Conservatives, making them the party of [[business]] and [[commerce]].<ref>{{cite book|title=|last=Feuchtwanger|year=|isbn=|location=|page=273|quote=|via=}}</ref>\n\nAfter a period of Liberal dominance before the [[First World War]], the Conservatives gradually became more influential in government, regaining full control of the cabinet in 1922.

It was influenced by [[Counter-Enlightenment]] works by men such as [[Joseph de Maistre]] and [[Louis de Bonald]]. Many continental or traditionalist conservatives do not support [[separation of church and state]], with most supporting state recognition of and cooperation with the [[Catholic Church in France|Catholic Church]], such as had existed in France before the Revolution.\n\nEventually, conservatives added [[Gaullism]], [[patriotism]], and [[nationalism]] to the list of traditional values they support.

Bismarck's \"balance of power\" model maintained peace in Europe for decades at the end of the 19th century. His \"revolutionary conservatism\" was a conservative state-building strategy designed to make ordinary Germans\u2014not just the Junker elite\u2014more loyal to state and emperor, he created the modern welfare state in Germany in the 1880s.

[[Liberty]] within the bounds of conformity to conservatism is a core value, with a particular emphasis on strengthening the [[free market]], limiting the size and scope of government and opposition to high taxes and government or labor union encroachment on the entrepreneur.\n\nThe major conservative party in the United States is the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]], also known as the GOP (Grand Old Party). American conservatives consider [[individualism|individual liberty]], as long as it conforms to conservative values, [[small government]], [[deregulation]] of the government, [[economic liberalism]], and [[free trade]], as the fundamental traits of democracy, which contrasts with [[Modern Liberalism in the United States|modern American liberals]], who generally place a greater value on [[social equality]] and [[social justice]].<ref>Gregory L.

Both conservative and liberal parties tend to favor private ownership of property, in opposition to communist, socialist and green parties, which favor communal ownership or laws requiring social responsibility on the part of property owners. Where conservatives and liberals differ is primarily on social issues. Conservatives tend to reject behavior that does not [[conformity|conform]] to some [[social norm]]. Modern conservative parties often define themselves by their opposition to liberal or labor parties. The United States usage of the term \"conservative\" is unique to that country.<ref>Ware, Alan.

Mostly, this has been achieved through control of and support for civil institutions, the church and the armed forces, rather than through party politics. Typically, the church was exempt from taxes and its employees immune from civil prosecution. Where national conservative parties were weak or non-existent, conservatives were more likely to rely on military dictatorship as a preferred form of government. However, in some nations where the elites were able to mobilize popular support for conservative parties, longer periods of political stability were achieved.

They developed in the socio-economic and political cleavages that existed during the first three decades of the 19th century and had the support of the business, professional and established Church (Anglican) elites in Ontario and to a lesser extent in Quebec. Holding a monopoly over administrative and judicial offices, they were called the \"[[Family Compact]]\" in Ontario and the \"[[Chateau Clique]]\" in Quebec. [[John A. Macdonald]]'s successful leadership of the movement to confederate the provinces and his subsequent tenure as prime minister for most of the late 19th century rested on his ability to bring together the English-speaking Protestant oligarchy and the [[ultramontane]] Catholic hierarchy of Quebec and to keep them united in a conservative coalition.<ref>Kornberg, Allan and Mishler, William.

Both it and the Liberal party were suppressed by the authoritarian, arch-conservative and royalist [[4th of August Regime]] of [[Ioannis Metaxas]] in 1936\u20131941. The PP was able to re-group after the Second World War as part of a United Nationalist Front which achieved power campaigning on a simple anticommunist, ultranationalist platform during the [[Greek Civil War]] (1946\u20131949). However, the vote received by the PP declined during the so-called \"Centrist Interlude\" in 1950\u20131952. In 1952, Marshal [[Alexandros Papagos]] created the [[Greek Rally]] as an umbrella for the right-wing forces. The Greek Rally came to power in 1952 and remained the leading party in Greece until 1963\u2014after Papagos' death in 1955 reformed as the [[National Radical Union]] under [[Konstantinos Karamanlis]]. Right-wing governments backed by the palace and the army overthrew the [[Centre Union]] government in 1965 and governed the country until the establishment of the far-right [[Greek junta]] (1967\u20131974). After the [[metapolitefsi|regime's collapse]] in August 1974, Karamanlis returned from exile to lead the government and founded the [[New Democracy (Greece)|New Democracy]] party. The new conservative party had four objectives: to confront [[Turkish invasion of Cyprus|Turkish expansionism in Cyprus]], to reestablish and solidify democratic rule, to give the country a strong government and to make a powerful moderate party a force in Greek politics.<ref>Penniman, Howard Rae.

From the beginning, they have been the largest vote-winning party, averaging around 40%. They combined liberalism and conservatism, supported nationalization of infrastructure and opposed class conflict. While mostly in opposition during the 1930s, they embraced [[economic liberalism]], but accepted the welfare state after the war and participated in governments supportive of state intervention and protectionism. Unlike other Scandanivian conservative (and liberal) parties, it has always had a large working-class following.<ref>Grofman, Bernard and Lijpart, Arend, editors.

It formed its first government under parliamentarism in 1889 and continued to alternate in power with the Liberals until the 1930s, when Labour became the dominant political party. It has elements both of paternalism, stressing the responsibilities of the state, and of economic liberalism. It first returned to power in the 1960s.<ref>[[Knut Heidar|Heidar, Knut]].

The SVP emphasized agricultural policy and was strong among farmers in German-speaking Protestant areas. As Switzerland considered closer relations with the European Union in the 1990s, the SVP adopted a more militant protectionist and isolationist stance. This stance has allowed it to expand into German-speaking Catholic mountainous areas.<ref>Siaroff, Alan ''Comparative European Party Systems''.

Officially, DC refused the ideology of conservatism, but in many aspects, for example [[family values]], it was a typical [[social conservative]] party.\n\nIn 1994, the media tycoon and entrepreneur [[Silvio Berlusconi]] founded the [[liberal conservative]] party [[Forza Italia]] (FI). Berlusconi won three elections in [[1994 Italian general election|1994]], [[2001 Italian general election|2001]] and [[2008 Italian general election|2008]], governing the country for almost ten years as [[Prime Minister of Italy|Prime Minister]]. Forza Italia formed a coalition with right-wing regional party [[Lega Nord]] while in government.\n\nBesides FI, now the conservative ideas are mainly expressed by the [[New Centre-Right]] party led by [[Angelino Alfano]], Berlusconi formed a new party, which is a rebirth of [[Forza Italia (2013)|Forza Italia]], thuds founding a new conservative movement. Alfano served as [[Italian Minister of Foreign Affairs|Minister of Foreign Affairs]]. After the [[2018 Italian general election|2018 election]], [[Lega Nord]] and the [[Five Star Movement]] formed the current [[right-wing populist]] government.\n\n==== Russia ====\nUnder [[Vladimir Putin]], the dominant leader since 1999, Russia has promoted explicitly conservative policies in social, cultural and political matters, both at home and abroad. Putin has attacked globalism and economic liberalism. Russian conservatism is unique in some respects as it supports [[Economic interventionism|Economic intervention]] with a [[mixed economy]], with a strong [[Russian nationalism|nationalist sentiment]] and [[social conservatism]] with its views being largely [[Right-wing populism|populist]]. Russian conservatism as a result opposes [[Right-libertarianism|libertarian]] ideals such as the aforementioned concept of [[economic liberalism]] found in other conservative movements around the world. Putin has as a result promoted new think tanks that bring together like-minded intellectuals and writers. For example, the Izborsky Club, founded in 2012 by Aleksandr Prokhanov, stresses Russian nationalism, the restoration of Russia's historical greatness and systematic opposition to liberal ideas and policies.<ref>Marlene Laruelle, \"[https://www.academia.edu/download/49116221/Russian_Review-Izborskii_Klub.pdf The Izborsky Club, or the New Conservative Avant\u2010Garde in Russia]{{Dead link|date=January 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes}}.\" ''Russian Review'' 75.4 (2016): 626\u2013644.</ref> [[Vladislav Surkov]], a senior government official, has been one of the key ideologists during Putin's presidency.<ref>Sirke M\u00e4kinen, \"Surkovian narrative on the future of Russia: making Russia a world leader.\" ''Journal of Communist Studies and Transition Politics'' 27#2 (2011): 143\u2013165.</ref>\n\nIn cultural and social affairs, Putin has collaborated closely with the [[Russian Orthodox Church]].

First it was the Democratic-Republican Party (1963\u20131980) and its head was [[Park Chung-hee]], who seized power in a 1961 military coup d'\u00e9tat and ruled as an unelected military strongman until his formal election as President in [[1963 South Korean presidential election|1963]]. He was President for 16 years until his assassination on 26 October 1979. The [[Democratic Justice Party]] inherited the same ideology as the Democratic-Republican Party. Its head, [[Chun Doo-hwan]], also gained power through a coup and his followers called themselves the Hanahae. The Democratic Justice Party changed its form and acted to suppress the opposition party and to follow the people's demand for direct elections. The party's [[Roh Tae-woo]] became the first President who was elected through direct election. The next form of the major conservative party was the Democratic-Liberal Party and again through election its second leader, [[Kim Young-sam]], became the fourteenth President of Korea. When the conservative party was beaten by the opposition party in the general election, it changed its form again to follow the party members' demand for reforms. It became the New Korean Party, but it changed again one year later since the President Kim Young-sam was blamed by the citizen for the [[International Monetary Fund]].{{clarify|date=March 2014}} It changed its name to Grand National Party (GNP). Since the late [[Kim Dae-jung]] assumed the presidency in 1998, GNP had been the opposition party until [[Lee Myung-bak]] won the presidential election of [[2007 South Korean presidential election|2007]].\n\n==== United States ====\n{{main|Conservatism in the United States}}\n[[File:President Reagan speaking in Minneapolis 1982.jpg|thumb|[[President of the United States]] [[Ronald Reagan]] (1981\u20131989), whose [[Reagan Doctrine]] has reshaped the Republican Party]]\nThe meaning of \"conservatism\" in the United States has little in common with the way the word is used elsewhere.

[[Edmund Burke]], an 18th-century politician who opposed the French Revolution, but supported the [[American Revolution]], is credited as one of the main theorists of [[conservatism in the United Kingdom|conservatism in Great Britain in the 1790s]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Frank O'Gorman|title=Edmund Burke: His Political Philosophy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U-reNJAnv1oC&pg=PA171|year=2003|publisher=Routledge|page=171|isbn=978-0-415-32684-1}}</ref>\n\nAccording to [[Quintin Hogg, Baron Hailsham of St Marylebone|Quintin Hogg]], the chairman of the British [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] in 1959: \"Conservatism is not so much a philosophy as an attitude, a constant force, performing a timeless function in the development of a free society, and corresponding to a deep and permanent requirement of human nature itself\".<ref>{{cite book|author=Quintin Hogg Baron Hailsham of St. Marylebone|title=The Conservative Case|url=https://www.google.com/search?q=%22+attitude,+a+constant+force,+performing+a+timeless+function+in+the+development+of+a+free+society,+and+corresponding+to+a+deep+and+permanent+requirement+of+human+nature+itself%22|year=1959|publisher=Penguin Books}}</ref>\n\n== Forms ==\n=== Liberal conservatism ===\n{{main|Liberal conservatism}}\n[[Liberal conservatism]] incorporates the [[classical liberal]] view of minimal government intervention in the economy. Individuals should be free to participate in the market and generate wealth without government interference.{{sfn|McAnulla|2006|p=71}} However, individuals cannot be thoroughly depended on to act responsibly in other spheres of life, therefore liberal conservatives believe that a strong state is necessary to ensure law and order and social institutions are needed to nurture a sense of duty and responsibility to the nation.{{sfn|McAnulla|2006|p=71}} Liberal conservatism is a variant of conservatism that is strongly influenced by [[Liberalism|liberal]] stances.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xGNRRwkZFysC&pg=PA109|title=Analyzing Politics|last=Grigsby|first=Ellen|publisher=[[Cengage Learning]]|year=2008|isbn=978-0-495-50112-1|location=|pages=108\u2013109, 112, 347|quote=|via=}}</ref>\n\nAs these latter two terms have had different meanings over time and across countries, liberal conservatism also has a wide variety of meanings. Historically, the term often referred to the combination of [[economic liberalism]], which champions ''[[laissez-faire]]'' markets, with the classical conservatism concern for established [[tradition]], respect for authority and religious values. It contrasted itself with [[classical liberalism]], which supported [[freedom for the individual]] in both the economic and social spheres.\n\nOver time, the general conservative ideology in many countries adopted economic liberal arguments and the term liberal conservatism was replaced with conservatism. This is also the case in countries where liberal economic ideas have been the tradition such as the United States and are thus considered conservative. In other countries where liberal conservative movements have entered the political mainstream, such as [[Italy]] and [[Spain]], the terms liberal and conservative may be synonymous. The liberal conservative tradition in the United States combines the economic [[individualism]] of the classical liberals with a [[Burkean]] form of conservatism (which has also become part of the [[American conservative]] tradition, such as in the writings of [[Russell Kirk]]).\n\nA secondary meaning for the term liberal conservatism that has developed in [[Europe]] is a combination of more modern conservative (less traditionalist) views with those of [[social liberalism]]. This has developed as an opposition to the more [[collectivist]] views of [[socialism]]. Often this involves stressing what are now conservative views of [[free market]] economics and belief in individual responsibility, with social liberal views on defence of [[civil rights]], [[environmentalism]] and support for a limited [[welfare state]]. In continental Europe, this is sometimes also translated into English as social conservatism.\n\n=== Conservative liberalism ===\n{{main|Conservative liberalism}}\n[[Conservative liberalism]] is a variant of liberalism that combines liberal values and policies with conservative stances.<ref>{{in lang|fr}} [http://www.ipolitique.fr/liberalisme-conservateur.htm Ipolitique.fr] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090319053712/http://www.ipolitique.fr/liberalisme-conservateur.htm |date=March 19, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.parties-and-elections.de/contents.html|title=parties-and-elections.de}}</ref><ref name=\"Mair\">{{Cite book|title=Representative Government in Europe|last=Gallagher|first=M.|last2=Laver|first2=M.|last3=Mair|first3=P.|year=|isbn=|location=|page=221|quote=|author-link=Michael Gallagher (academic)|author-link3=Peter Mair|via=}}</ref> The roots of conservative liberalism are found at the beginning of the [[History of liberal thought|history of liberalism]].

Its four main branches are [[constitutionalism]], [[paleolibertarianism]], [[American conservatism|small government conservatism]] and [[Christian libertarianism]]. They generally differ from [[Paleoconservatism|paleoconservatives]], in that they favor more [[liberty|personal]] and [[economic freedom]].\n\n[[Agorist]]s such as [[Samuel Edward Konkin III]] labeled libertarian conservatism [[right-libertarianism]].<ref name=\"nlm\">{{cite web|title=New Libertarian Manifesto |url=http://agorism.info/NewLibertarianManifesto.pdf |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120223021118/http://www.agorism.info/NewLibertarianManifesto.pdf |archivedate=February 23, 2012}}</ref><ref name=\"int\">{{cite web|title=Interview With Samuel Edward Konkin III|url=http://www.spaz.org/~dan/individualist-anarchist/software/konkin-interview.html}}</ref>\n\nIn contrast to paleoconservatives, libertarian conservatives support strict ''laissez-faire'' policies such as [[free trade]], opposition to any national bank and opposition to [[regulations|business regulations]]. They are vehemently opposed to [[environmental regulation]]s, [[corporate welfare]], [[subsidies]] and other areas of economic intervention.\n\nMany conservatives, especially in the United States, believe that the government should not play a major role in regulating business and managing the economy. They typically oppose efforts to charge high tax rates and to redistribute income to assist the poor. Such efforts, they argue, do not properly reward people who have earned their money through hard work.\n\n=== Fiscal conservatism ===\n{{main|Fiscal conservatism}}\n[[File:TeaPartyByFreedomFan.JPG|thumb|2009 [[Taxpayer March on Washington]] as conservative protesters walk down [[Pennsylvania Avenue (Washington, D.C.)|Pennsylvania Avenue]], Washington, D.

The claim of the citizen is prior in time, paramount in title, superior in equity.

As such, national conservatives can be distinguished from economic conservatives, for whom free market economic policies, [[deregulation]] and fiscal conservatism are the main priorities. Some commentators have identified a growing gap between national and economic conservatism: \"[M]ost parties of the Right [today] are run by economic conservatives who, in varying degrees, have marginalized social, cultural, and national conservatives\".<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20041121224135/http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1282/is_n12_v49/ai_19559422 National questions \u2013 conservatives fragmenting as liberals unite], National Review, June 30, 1997</ref> National conservatism is also related to [[traditionalist conservatism]].\n\nTraditionalist conservatism is a political philosophy emphasizing the need for the principles of [[natural law]] and transcendent moral order, [[tradition]], [[hierarchy]] and [[organic unity]], [[agrarianism]], [[classicism]] and [[high culture]] as well as the intersecting spheres of loyalty.<ref>Frohnen, Bruce, Jeremy Beer, and Jeffrey O.

In the United States, the term \"cultural conservative\" may imply a conservative position in the [[culture war]]. Cultural conservatives hold fast to traditional ways of thinking even in the face of monumental change. They believe strongly in traditional values and traditional politics and often have an urgent sense of nationalism.\n\n[[Social conservatism]] is distinct from cultural conservatism, although there are some overlaps. Social conservatives may believe that society is built upon a fragile network of relationships which need to be upheld through duty, traditional values and established institutions;{{sfn|Heywood|2017|p=69}} and that the government has a role in encouraging or enforcing traditional values or behaviours. A social conservative wants to preserve traditional morality and social mores, often by opposing what they consider radical policies or [[social engineering (political science)|social engineering]]. Social change is generally regarded as suspect.\n\nA second meaning of the term social conservatism developed in the [[Nordic countries]] and [[continental Europe]], where it refers to liberal conservatives supporting modern [[European welfare state]]s.\n\nSocial conservatives (in the first meaning of the phrase) in many countries generally favour the [[anti-abortion]] position in the [[abortion controversy]] and oppose human [[embryonic stem cell]] research (particularly if publicly funded); oppose both [[eugenics]] and [[human enhancement]] ([[transhumanism]]) while supporting [[bioconservatism]];<ref>[http://www.utne.com/2005-01-01/TheNextDigitalDivide.aspx?page=2 The Next Digital Divide] (utne article)</ref> support a traditional definition of marriage as being one man and one woman; view the [[nuclear family]] model as society's foundational unit; oppose expansion of [[civil marriage]] and [[child adoption]] to couples in [[same-sex relationship]]s; promote [[public morality]] and traditional [[family values]]; oppose [[atheism]],<ref>\"No, I don't know that atheists should be considered as citizens, nor should they be considered patriots.

Since it is consistent with principles such as [[Organic unity|organicism]], [[hierarchy]] and [[duty]], it can be seen as an outgrowth of [[traditional conservatism]].

He reports:\n<blockquote>Conservative or rightist extremist movements have arisen at different periods in modern history, ranging from the [[Mikl\u00f3s Horthy|Horthyites]] in Hungary, the [[Engelbert Dollfuss|Christian Social Party of Dollfuss in Austria]], ''[[Der Stahlhelm, Bund der Frontsoldaten|Der Stahlhelm]]'' and other nationalists in pre-Hitler Germany, and [[Ant\u00f3nio de Oliveira Salazar|Salazar in Portugal]], to the pre-1966 Gaullist movements and the monarchists in contemporary France and Italy. The right extremists are conservative, not revolutionary. They seek to change political institutions in order to preserve or restore cultural and economic ones, while extremists of the centre and left seek to use political means for cultural and social revolution. The ideal of the right extremist is not a totalitarian ruler, but a monarch, or a traditionalist who acts like one. Many such movements in Spain, Austria, Hungary, Germany, and Italy-have been explicitly monarchist... The supporters of these movements differ from those of the centrists, tending to be wealthier, and more religious, which is more important in terms of a potential for mass support.<ref>Seymour M. Lipset, \"Social Stratification and 'Right-Wing Extremism'\" ''British Journal of Sociology'' 10#4 (1959), pp. 346-382 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/587800 on-line]</ref></blockquote>\n\n== History ==\n=== Development of Western conservatism ===\n==== United Kingdom ====\n{{main|Conservatism in the United Kingdom}}\n{{Toryism|related}}\nIn Great Britain, conservative ideas (though not yet called that) emerged in the [[Tory]] movement during the [[Restoration (England)|Restoration]] period (1660\u20131688). Toryism supported a hierarchical society with a monarch who ruled by [[Divine right of kings|divine right]]. [[Tories (British political party)|Tories]] opposed the idea that sovereignty derived from the people and rejected the authority of parliament and freedom of religion. [[Robert Filmer]]'s ''Patriarcha: or the Natural Power of Kings'' (published posthumously in 1680, but written before the [[English Civil War]] of 1642\u20131651) became accepted as the statement of their doctrine. However, the [[Glorious Revolution]] of 1688 destroyed this principle to some degree by establishing a constitutional government in England, leading to the hegemony of the Tory-opposed [[Whigs (British political party)|Whig]] ideology. Faced with defeat, the Tories reformed their movement, now holding that sovereignty was vested in the three estates of Crown, Lords and Commons<ref>{{harvnb|Eccleshall|1990|pp=ix, 21}}</ref> rather than solely in the Crown. Toryism became marginalized during the long period of Whig ascendancy in the 18th century.\n\nConservatives typically see [[Richard Hooker]] (1554\u20131600) as the founding father of conservatism, along with the [[George Savile, 1st Marquess of Halifax|Marquess of Halifax]] (1633\u20131695), [[David Hume]] (1711\u20131776) and [[Edmund Burke]] (1729\u20131797).

He supported the [[American Revolution]] of 1765\u20131783, but abhorred the violence of the [[French Revolution]] (1789\u20131799). He accepted the liberal ideals of private property and the economics of [[Adam Smith]] (1723\u20131790), but thought that economics should remain subordinate to the conservative social ethic, that capitalism should be subordinate to the medieval social tradition and that the business class should be subordinate to [[aristocracy]]. He insisted on standards of honor derived from the medieval aristocratic tradition and saw the aristocracy as the nation's natural leaders.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Conservative Illusion|last=Auerbach|year=1959|isbn=|location=|pages=37\u201340|quote=|via=}}</ref> That meant limits on the powers of the Crown, since he found the institutions of Parliament to be better informed than commissions appointed by the executive.

Despite their influence on future conservative thought, none of these early contributors were explicitly involved in Tory politics. Hooker lived in the 16th century, long before the advent of [[toryism]], whilst Hume was an apolitical philosopher and Halifax similarly politically independent. Burke described himself as a Whig.\n\n===== Revival =====\n[[File:EdmundBurke1771.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Edmund Burke]] (1729\u20131797)]]\nShortly after Burke's death in 1797, conservatism revived as a mainstream political force as the Whigs suffered a series of internal divisions. This new generation of conservatives derived their politics not from Burke, but from his predecessor, the [[Henry St John, 1st Viscount Bolingbroke|Viscount Bolingbroke]] (1678\u20131751), who was a Jacobite and traditional Tory, lacking Burke's sympathies for Whiggish policies such as [[Catholic emancipation]] and [[American Revolution|American independence]] (famously attacked by [[Samuel Johnson]] in \"Taxation No Tyranny\"). In the first half of the 19th century, many newspapers, magazines, and journals promoted loyalist or right-wing attitudes in religion, politics and international affairs. Burke was seldom mentioned, but [[William Pitt the Younger]] (1759\u20131806) became a conspicuous hero. The most prominent journals included ''The Quarterly Review'', founded in 1809 as a counterweight to the Whigs' ''Edinburgh Review'' and the even more conservative ''Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine''. Sack finds that the ''Quarterly Review'' promoted a balanced Canningite toryism as it was neutral on Catholic emancipation and only mildly critical of Nonconformist Dissent; it opposed slavery and supported the current poor laws; and it was \"aggressively imperialist\". The [[high-church]] clergy of the Church of England read the ''[[Orthodox Churchman's Magazine]]'' which was equally hostile to Jewish, Catholic, [[Jacobin]], [[Methodist]] and [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] spokesmen. Anchoring the ultra Tories, ''Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine'' stood firmly against Catholic emancipation and favoured slavery, cheap money, mercantilism, the [[Navigation Acts]] and the [[Holy Alliance]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Sack|first=J.

The effect was to significantly strengthen conservatism as a grassroots political force. Conservatism no longer was the philosophical defense of the landed aristocracy, but had been refreshed into redefining its commitment to the ideals of order, both secular and religious, expanding imperialism, strengthened monarchy and a more generous vision of the welfare state as opposed to the punitive vision of the Whigs and liberals.<ref>Gregory Claeys, \"Political Thought\", in Chris Williams, ed., ''A Companion to 19th-Century Britain'' (2006). p. 195</ref> As early as 1835, Disraeli attacked the Whigs and utilitarians as slavishly devoted to an industrial oligarchy, while he described his fellow Tories as the only \"really democratic party of England\" and devoted to the interests of the whole people.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Charles Richmond|author2=Paul Smith|title=The Self-Fashioning of Disraeli, 1818\u20131851|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jnF3IRJbKR8C&pg=PA162|year=1998|publisher=Cambridge UP|page=162|isbn=978-0-521-49729-9}}</ref> Nevertheless, inside the party there was a tension between the growing numbers of wealthy businessmen on the one side and the aristocracy and rural gentry on the other.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Conservative Illusion|last=Auerbach|year=1959|isbn=|location=|pages=39\u201340|quote=|via=}}</ref> The aristocracy gained strength as businessmen discovered they could use their wealth to buy a peerage and a country estate.\n\nAlthough conservatives opposed attempts to allow greater representation of the middle class in parliament, they conceded that [[electoral reform]] could not be reversed and promised to support further reforms so long as they did not erode the institutions of church and state. These new principles were presented in the [[Tamworth Manifesto]] of 1834, which historians regard as the basic statement of the beliefs of the new Conservative Party.<ref>{{harvnb|Eccleshall|1990|pp=79\u201380}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Robert Peel Portrait.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Robert Peel]] (1788\u20131850)]]\nSome conservatives lamented the passing of a pastoral world where the ethos of ''[[noblesse oblige]]'' had promoted respect from the lower classes.

This marked the beginning of the transformation of British conservatism from [[High Tory]] reactionism towards a more modern form based on \"conservation\". The party became known as the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] as a result, a name it has retained to this day. However, Peel would also be the root of a split in the party between the traditional Tories (led by the [[Edward Smith-Stanley, 14th Earl of Derby|Earl of Derby]] and [[Benjamin Disraeli]]) and the \"Peelites\" (led first by Peel himself, then by the [[George Hamilton-Gordon, 4th Earl of Aberdeen|Earl of Aberdeen]]). The split occurred in 1846 over the issue of [[free trade]], which Peel supported, versus [[protectionism]], supported by Derby. The majority of the party sided with Derby whilst about a third split away, eventually merging with the [[Whigs (British political party)|Whigs]] and the [[radicalism (politics)|radicals]] to form the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]]. Despite the split, the mainstream Conservative Party accepted the doctrine of free trade in 1852.\n\nIn the second half of the 19th century, the Liberal Party faced political schisms, especially over [[History of Ireland|Irish]] [[Irish Parliamentary Party|Home Rule]]. Leader [[William Gladstone]] (himself a former Peelite) sought to give Ireland a degree of autonomy, a move that elements in both the left and right-wings of his party opposed. These split off to become the [[Liberal Unionist Party|Liberal Unionists]] (led by [[Joseph Chamberlain]]), forming a coalition with the Conservatives before merging with them in 1912. The Liberal Unionist influence dragged the Conservative Party towards the left as Conservative governments passing a number of progressive reforms at the turn of the 20th century. By the late 19th century, the traditional business supporters of the Liberal Party had joined the Conservatives, making them the party of [[business]] and [[commerce]].<ref>{{cite book|title=|last=Feuchtwanger|year=|isbn=|location=|page=273|quote=|via=}}</ref>\n\nAfter a period of Liberal dominance before the [[First World War]], the Conservatives gradually became more influential in government, regaining full control of the cabinet in 1922. In the inter-war period, conservatism was the major ideology in Britain<ref>Stuart Ball, \"Baldwin, Stanley, first Earl Baldwin of Bewdley (1867\u20131947)\", ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'' 2004.</ref><ref>Ross McKibbin, ''Parties and people: England, 1914\u20131951'' (Oxford, 2010).</ref><ref>Garside, W.R.; Greaves, J.I.

It was influenced by [[Counter-Enlightenment]] works by men such as [[Joseph de Maistre]] and [[Louis de Bonald]]. Many continental or traditionalist conservatives do not support [[separation of church and state]], with most supporting state recognition of and cooperation with the [[Catholic Church in France|Catholic Church]], such as had existed in France before the Revolution.\n\nEventually, conservatives added [[Gaullism]], [[patriotism]], and [[nationalism]] to the list of traditional values they support.

Bismarck's \"balance of power\" model maintained peace in Europe for decades at the end of the 19th century. His \"revolutionary conservatism\" was a conservative state-building strategy designed to make ordinary Germans\u2014not just the Junker elite\u2014more loyal to state and emperor, he created the modern welfare state in Germany in the 1880s.

[[Liberty]] within the bounds of conformity to conservatism is a core value, with a particular emphasis on strengthening the [[free market]], limiting the size and scope of government and opposition to high taxes and government or labor union encroachment on the entrepreneur.\n\nThe major conservative party in the United States is the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]], also known as the GOP (Grand Old Party).

Holding a monopoly over administrative and judicial offices, they were called the \"[[Family Compact]]\" in Ontario and the \"[[Chateau Clique]]\" in Quebec. [[John A. Macdonald]]'s successful leadership of the movement to confederate the provinces and his subsequent tenure as prime minister for most of the late 19th century rested on his ability to bring together the English-speaking Protestant oligarchy and the [[ultramontane]] Catholic hierarchy of Quebec and to keep them united in a conservative coalition.<ref>Kornberg, Allan and Mishler, William.

Toronto: James Lorimer & Company, 2004. {{ISBN|978-1-55028-814-8}} pp. 57, 77</ref> By the end of the 1960's, the political debate in Quebec centered around the question of independence, opposing the [[Social democracy|social democratic]] and [[Quebec sovereignty movement|sovereignist]] [[Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois]] and the [[Centrism|centrist]] and [[Federalism in Quebec|federalist]] [[Quebec Liberal Party]], therefore marginalizing the conservative movement. Most French Canadian conservatives rallied either the [[Quebec Liberal Party]] or the [[Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois]], while some of them still tried to offer an autonomist third-way with what was left of the [[Union Nationale (Quebec)|Union Nationale]] or the more [[Populism|populists]] [[Ralliement cr\u00e9ditiste du Qu\u00e9bec]] and [[Parti national populaire]], but by the [[1981 Quebec general election|1981 provincial election]] politically organized conservatism had been obliterated in Quebec. It slowly started to revive at the [[1994 Quebec general election|1994 provincial election]] with the [[Action d\u00e9mocratique du Qu\u00e9bec]], who served as [[Parliamentary opposition|Offical opposition]] in the [[National Assembly of Quebec|National Assembly]] from 2007 to 2008, before its merger with [[Fran\u00e7ois Legault|Fran\u00e7ois Legault's]] [[Coalition Avenir Qu\u00e9bec]] in 2012, that took power in 2018.\n\nThe modern [[Conservative Party of Canada]] has rebranded conservatism and under the leadership of [[Stephen Harper]], the Conservative Party added more conservative policies.\n\n==== Colombia ====\n{{main|Conservatism in Colombia}}\nThe [[Colombian Conservative Party]], founded in 1849, traces its origins to opponents of General [[Francisco de Paula Santander]]'s 1833\u20131837 administration. While the term \"liberal\" had been used to describe all political forces in Colombia, the conservatives began describing themselves as \"conservative liberals\" and their opponents as \"red liberals\". From the 1860s until the present, the party has supported strong central government; supported the Catholic Church, especially its role as protector of the sanctity of the family; and opposed separation of church and state. Its policies include the legal equality of all men, the citizen's right to own property and opposition to dictatorship. It has usually been Colombia's second largest party, with the [[Colombian Liberal Party]] being the largest.<ref>Osterling, p. 180</ref>\n\n==== Denmark ====\nFounded in 1915, the [[Conservative People's Party (Denmark)|Conservative People's Party of Denmark]]. was the successor of ''H\u00f8jre'' (literally \"[[Right-wing politics|Right\"]]). The conservative party led the government coalition from 1982 to 1993. The party was a junior partner in coalition with the [[Venstre (Denmark)|Liberals]] from 2001 to 2011.<ref>Annesley, Claire.

The party suffered a major defeat in the parliamentary elections of September 2011 in which the party lost more than half of its seat and also lost governmental power. A liberal cultural policy dominated during the post-war period. However, by the 1990s, disagreements regarding immigrants from entirely different cultures ignited a conservative backlash.<ref>Kasper St\u00f8vring, \"The Turn from Cultural Radicalism to National Conservatism: Cultural Policy in Denmark.\" ''Telos'' 2009.148 (2009) pp. 54\u201372</ref>\n\n==== Finland ====\nThe conservative party in Finland is the [[National Coalition Party]] (in Finnish ''Kansallinen Kokoomus'', ''Kok''). The party was founded in 1918 when several monarchist parties united. Although in the past the party was right-wing, today it is a moderate liberal conservative party. While the party advocates [[economic liberalism]], it is committed to the [[social market economy]].<ref>Siaroff, Alan.

Both it and the Liberal party were suppressed by the authoritarian, arch-conservative and royalist [[4th of August Regime]] of [[Ioannis Metaxas]] in 1936\u20131941. The PP was able to re-group after the Second World War as part of a United Nationalist Front which achieved power campaigning on a simple anticommunist, ultranationalist platform during the [[Greek Civil War]] (1946\u20131949). However, the vote received by the PP declined during the so-called \"Centrist Interlude\" in 1950\u20131952. In 1952, Marshal [[Alexandros Papagos]] created the [[Greek Rally]] as an umbrella for the right-wing forces. The Greek Rally came to power in 1952 and remained the leading party in Greece until 1963\u2014after Papagos' death in 1955 reformed as the [[National Radical Union]] under [[Konstantinos Karamanlis]]. Right-wing governments backed by the palace and the army overthrew the [[Centre Union]] government in 1965 and governed the country until the establishment of the far-right [[Greek junta]] (1967\u20131974). After the [[metapolitefsi|regime's collapse]] in August 1974, Karamanlis returned from exile to lead the government and founded the [[New Democracy (Greece)|New Democracy]] party. The new conservative party had four objectives: to confront [[Turkish invasion of Cyprus|Turkish expansionism in Cyprus]], to reestablish and solidify democratic rule, to give the country a strong government and to make a powerful moderate party a force in Greek politics.<ref>Penniman, Howard Rae.

From the beginning, they have been the largest vote-winning party, averaging around 40%. They combined liberalism and conservatism, supported nationalization of infrastructure and opposed class conflict. While mostly in opposition during the 1930s, they embraced [[economic liberalism]], but accepted the welfare state after the war and participated in governments supportive of state intervention and protectionism. Unlike other Scandanivian conservative (and liberal) parties, it has always had a large working-class following.<ref>Grofman, Bernard and Lijpart, Arend, editors.

It formed its first government under parliamentarism in 1889 and continued to alternate in power with the Liberals until the 1930s, when Labour became the dominant political party.

The SVP emphasized agricultural policy and was strong among farmers in German-speaking Protestant areas. As Switzerland considered closer relations with the European Union in the 1990s, the SVP adopted a more militant protectionist and isolationist stance. This stance has allowed it to expand into German-speaking Catholic mountainous areas.<ref>Siaroff, Alan ''Comparative European Party Systems''.

Officially, DC refused the ideology of conservatism, but in many aspects, for example [[family values]], it was a typical [[social conservative]] party.\n\nIn 1994, the media tycoon and entrepreneur [[Silvio Berlusconi]] founded the [[liberal conservative]] party [[Forza Italia]] (FI). Berlusconi won three elections in [[1994 Italian general election|1994]], [[2001 Italian general election|2001]] and [[2008 Italian general election|2008]], governing the country for almost ten years as [[Prime Minister of Italy|Prime Minister]].

Alfano served as [[Italian Minister of Foreign Affairs|Minister of Foreign Affairs]]. After the [[2018 Italian general election|2018 election]], [[Lega Nord]] and the [[Five Star Movement]] formed the current [[right-wing populist]] government.\n\n==== Russia ====\nUnder [[Vladimir Putin]], the dominant leader since 1999, Russia has promoted explicitly conservative policies in social, cultural and political matters, both at home and abroad. Putin has attacked globalism and economic liberalism. Russian conservatism is unique in some respects as it supports [[Economic interventionism|Economic intervention]] with a [[mixed economy]], with a strong [[Russian nationalism|nationalist sentiment]] and [[social conservatism]] with its views being largely [[Right-wing populism|populist]]. Russian conservatism as a result opposes [[Right-libertarianism|libertarian]] ideals such as the aforementioned concept of [[economic liberalism]] found in other conservative movements around the world. Putin has as a result promoted new think tanks that bring together like-minded intellectuals and writers. For example, the Izborsky Club, founded in 2012 by Aleksandr Prokhanov, stresses Russian nationalism, the restoration of Russia's historical greatness and systematic opposition to liberal ideas and policies.<ref>Marlene Laruelle, \"[https://www.academia.edu/download/49116221/Russian_Review-Izborskii_Klub.pdf The Izborsky Club, or the New Conservative Avant\u2010Garde in Russia]{{Dead link|date=January 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes}}.\" ''Russian Review'' 75.4 (2016): 626\u2013644.</ref> [[Vladislav Surkov]], a senior government official, has been one of the key ideologists during Putin's presidency.<ref>Sirke M\u00e4kinen, \"Surkovian narrative on the future of Russia: making Russia a world leader.\" ''Journal of Communist Studies and Transition Politics'' 27#2 (2011): 143\u2013165.</ref>\n\nIn cultural and social affairs, Putin has collaborated closely with the [[Russian Orthodox Church]].

First it was the Democratic-Republican Party (1963\u20131980) and its head was [[Park Chung-hee]], who seized power in a 1961 military coup d'\u00e9tat and ruled as an unelected military strongman until his formal election as President in [[1963 South Korean presidential election|1963]]. He was President for 16 years until his assassination on 26 October 1979. The [[Democratic Justice Party]] inherited the same ideology as the Democratic-Republican Party. Its head, [[Chun Doo-hwan]], also gained power through a coup and his followers called themselves the Hanahae. The Democratic Justice Party changed its form and acted to suppress the opposition party and to follow the people's demand for direct elections. The party's [[Roh Tae-woo]] became the first President who was elected through direct election. The next form of the major conservative party was the Democratic-Liberal Party and again through election its second leader, [[Kim Young-sam]], became the fourteenth President of Korea. When the conservative party was beaten by the opposition party in the general election, it changed its form again to follow the party members' demand for reforms. It became the New Korean Party, but it changed again one year later since the President Kim Young-sam was blamed by the citizen for the [[International Monetary Fund]].{{clarify|date=March 2014}} It changed its name to Grand National Party (GNP).
