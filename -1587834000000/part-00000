During the first two years of [[World War II]], the [[United States]] had maintained formal [[Non-interventionism|neutrality]] as made official in the [[Quarantine Speech]] delivered by [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] in 1937, while supplying [[United Kingdom|Britain]], the [[Soviet Union]], and [[Republic of China (1912\u201349)|China]] with war material through the [[Lend-Lease|Lend-Lease Act]] which was signed into law on 11 March 1941, as well as [[Occupation of Iceland#United States occupation|deploying the U.S. military]] to replace the [[Invasion of Iceland|British invasion forces in Iceland]]. Following the \"Greer incident\" Roosevelt publicly confirmed the \"shoot on sight\" order on 11 September 1941, effectively declaring naval war on Germany and Italy in the [[Battle of the Atlantic]].<ref>Burns, James MacGregor (1970).

Stimson]], who mobilized the nation's industries and induction centers to supply the [[United States Army|Army]], commanded by [[General (United States)|General]] [[George Marshall]] and the [[Army Air Forces]] under General [[Hap Arnold]]. The [[United States Navy|Navy]], led by [[Secretary of the Navy]] [[Frank Knox]] and [[Admiral (United States)|Admiral]] [[Ernest King]], proved more autonomous. Overall priorities were set by Roosevelt and the [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]], chaired by [[William D. Leahy|William Leahy]]. Highest priority went to the defeat of Germany in Europe, but first the war against Japan in the Pacific was more urgent after the sinking of the main battleship fleet at [[Pearl Harbor]].\n\nAdmiral King put Admiral [[Chester W. Nimitz]], based in Hawaii, in charge of the Pacific War against Japan. The [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] had the advantage, taking the [[Philippines Campaign (1941\u201342)|Philippines]] as well as British and Dutch possessions, and threatening Australia but in June 1942, its main carriers were sunk during the [[Battle of Midway]], and the Americans seized the initiative. The Pacific War became one of [[island hopping]], so as to move [[Military airbase|air bases]] closer and closer to Japan. The Army, based in Australia under General [[Douglas MacArthur]], steadily advanced across [[New Guinea campaign|New Guinea]] to the [[Philippines Campaign (1944\u201345)|Philippines]], with plans to invade the Japanese home islands in late 1945. With its merchant fleet sunk by American submarines, Japan ran short of aviation gasoline and fuel oil, as the U.S. Navy in June 1944 captured islands within [[Air raids on Japan|bombing range of the Japanese home islands]]. [[Strategic bombing]] directed by General [[Curtis Lemay]] destroyed all the major Japanese cities, as the U.S. [[Battle of Okinawa|captured Okinawa]] after heavy losses in spring 1945. With the [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]], the [[Soviet invasion of Manchuria]], and [[Operation Downfall|an invasion of the home islands]] imminent, [[Surrender of Japan|Japan surrendered]].\n\nThe war in Europe involved aid to Britain, her allies, and the Soviet Union, with the U.S. supplying munitions until it could ready an invasion force. U.S. forces were first tested to a limited degree in the [[Tunisia Campaign|North African Campaign]] and then employed more significantly with [[British Armed Forces|British Forces]] in [[Italian Campaign (World War II)|Italy in 1943\u201345]], where U.S. forces, representing about a third of the [[Allies of World War II|Allied forces]] deployed, bogged down after [[Armistice of Cassibile|Italy surrendered]] and the Germans took over. Finally the main [[Operation Overlord|invasion of France]] took place in June 1944, under General [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]]. Meanwhile, the [[United States Army Air Forces|U.S. Army Air Forces]] and the [[Royal Air Force|British Royal Air Force]] engaged in the area bombardment of German cities and systematically targeted German transportation links and synthetic oil plants, as it knocked out what was left of the [[Luftwaffe]] post [[Battle of Britain]] in 1944. Being invaded from all sides, it became clear that Germany would lose the war. Berlin [[Battle of Berlin|fell to the Soviets]] in May 1945, and with [[Adolf Hitler]] [[Death of Adolf Hitler|dead]], the [[Victory in Europe Day|Germans surrendered]].\n\nThe military effort was strongly supported by [[United States home front during World War II|civilians on the home front]], who provided the military personnel, the munitions, the money, and the morale to fight the war to victory. World War II cost the United States an estimated $341 billion in 1945 dollars \u2013 equivalent to 74% of America's [[GDP]] and expenditures during the war. In 2015 dollars, the war cost over $4.5 trillion.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usinflationcalculator.com/|title=US Inflation Calculator|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.multpl.com/us-gdp|title=US GDP|last=multpl|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n==Origins==\nAmerican public opinion was hostile to the Axis, but how much aid to give the Allies was controversial. The United States returned to its typical [[Isolationism|isolationist]] foreign policy after the [[World War I|First World War]] and President [[Woodrow Wilson]]'s failure to have the [[Treaty of Versailles]] ratified. Although President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] personally favored a more assertive foreign policy, his administration remained committed to isolationism during the 1930's in order to ensure [[New Deal coalition|congressional support]] for the [[New Deal]], and allowed Congress to pass the [[Neutrality Acts of the 1930s|Neutrality Acts]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://history.state.gov/milestones/1937-1945/american-isolationism|title=Milestones: 1937\u20131945 - Office of the Historian|website=history.state.gov|access-date=2020-01-24}}</ref> As a result, the United States played no role in the [[Second Italo-Ethiopian War]] and the [[Spanish Civil War]]. After the [[Invasion of Poland|German invasion of Poland]] and the beginning of the war in September 1939, Congress allowed foreign countries to purchase war material from the United States on a \"[[Cash and carry (World War II)|cash-and-carry]]\" basis, but assistance to the United Kingdom was still limited by British hard currency shortages and the [[Johnson Act]], and President Roosevelt's military advisers believed that the Allied Powers would be defeated and that U.S. military assets should be focused on defending the [[Western Hemisphere]]. \n\nBy 1940 the U.S., while still neutral, was becoming the \"[[Arsenal of Democracy]]\" for the Allies, supplying money and war materials. Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]] and President Roosevelt agreed to exchange fifty U.S. [[Destroyer|destroyers]] for 99-year-leases to British military bases in [[Dominion of Newfoundland|Newfoundland]] and the [[Caribbean]].The [[Battle of France|sudden defeat of France]] in spring 1940 caused the nation to begin to expand its armed forces, including the first [[Conscription in the United States|peacetime draft]]. In preparation of expected German aggression against the Soviet Union, negotiations for better diplomatic relations began between [[Undersecretary of State]] [[Sumner Welles]] and [[Soviet Ambassador to the United States]] [[Konstantin Umansky]].<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://history.state.gov/milestones/1937-1945/us-soviet|title=Milestones: 1937\u20131945 - Office of the Historian|website=history.state.gov|access-date=2020-01-23}}</ref> After the [[Operation Barbarossa|German invasion of the Soviet Union]] in June 1941, America began sending [[Lend Lease]] aid to the Soviet Union as well as Britain and China.<ref>Robert Dallek, ''Franklin D.

After the 1931 [[Japanese invasion of Manchuria]], the United States articulated the [[Stimson Doctrine]], named for [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[Henry L. Stimson]], stating that no territory conquered by military force would be recognized. The United States also withdrew from the [[Washington Naval Treaty]] limiting naval tonnage in response to Japan's violations of the [[Nine-Power Treaty]] and the [[Kellogg\u2013Briand Pact]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://history.state.gov/milestones/1921-1936/mukden-incident|title=Milestones: 1921\u20131936 - Office of the Historian|website=history.state.gov|access-date=2020-01-23}}</ref> Public opposition to [[Japanese militarism|Japanese expansionism]] in Asia had mounted during the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] when the [[Imperial Japanese Army Air Service]] [[USS Panay incident|attacked]] and sank the [[Yangtze Patrol|U.S. Yangtze Patrol]] [[gunboat]] ''[[USS Panay (PR-5)|USS Panay]]'' in the [[Yangtze|Yangtze River]] while the ship was evacuating civilians from the [[Nanjing Massacre]]''.''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=17110447|title=A Japanese Attack Before Pearl Harbor|website=NPR.org|language=en|access-date=2020-01-23}}</ref> Although the U.S. government accepted Japanese official apologies and indemnities for the incident, it resulted in increasing trade restrictions against Japan and corresponding increases U.S. credit and aid to China.

Although under American law, it was illegal for United States citizens to join the armed forces of foreign nations and in doing so, they lost their [[Citizenship of the United States|citizenship]], many American volunteers changed their nationality to [[Canadians|Canadian]]. However Congress passed a blanket pardon in 1944.<ref name=\"Eagle Squadrons\">{{cite web|url=http://www.rafmuseum.org.uk/research/online-exhibitions/americans-in-the-royal-air-force/eagle-squadrons.aspx|title=Eagle Squadrons|accessdate= 19 April 2015}}</ref> American mercenary Colonel Charles Sweeny, living in [[London]], began recruiting American citizens to fight as a U.S. volunteer detachment in the [[French Air Force]], however France fell before this was implemented.<ref name=\"Eagle Squadrons\"/> During the [[Battle of Britain]], 11 American pilots flew in the [[Royal Air Force]]. Charles Sweeney's nephew, also named Charles, formed a [[Home Guard (United Kingdom)|Home Guard]] unit from American volunteers living in London.<ref name=\"Eagle Squadrons\"/>\n\nOne notable example was the [[Eagle Squadrons]], which were [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] squadrons made up of American volunteers and British personnel. The first to be formed was [[No. 71 Squadron RAF|No. 71 Squadron]] on 19 September 1940, followed by  [[No. 121 Squadron RAF|No. 121 Squadron]] on 14 May 1941 and [[No. 133 Squadron RAF|No. 133 Squadron]] on 1 August 1941. 6,700 Americans applied to join but only 244 got to serve with the three Eagle squadrons; 16 Britons also served as squadron and flight commanders. The first became operational in February 1941 and the squadrons scored their first kill in July 1941. On 29 September 1942, the three squadrons were officially turned over by the RAF to the [[Eighth Air Force]] of the [[U.S. Army Air Forces]] and became the [[4th Fighter Group]]. In their time with the RAF the squadrons claim to have shot 73\u00bd German planes; 77 Americans and 5 Britons were killed.<ref>'Aces High', Shores and Williams, 1994, pages 31, 38, 40</ref>\n\nAnother notable example was the [[Flying Tigers]], created by [[Claire Chennault|Claire L. Chennault]], a retired [[U.S. Army Air Corps]] officer working in the [[Republic of China#History|China]] since August 1937, first as [[military aviation]] advisor to [[Generalissimo]] [[Chiang Kai-shek]] in the early months of the [[Sino-Japanese War (1937\u20131945)|Sino-Japanese War]]. Officially known as the 1st American Volunteer Group (AVG) but nicknamed the \"Flying Tigers\", this was a group of American Pilots already serving in the [[United States Armed Forces|US Armed forces]] and recruited under presidential authority. As a unit they would serve in the Chinese Air Force to fight against the [[Armed Forces of the Empire of Japan|Japanese]]. The group comprised three fighter squadrons of around 30 aircraft each. The AVG's first combat mission was on 20 December 1941, twelve days after the Pearl Harbor attack. On 4 July 1942 the AVG was disbanded, and was replaced by the [[23rd Fighter Group]] of the [[United States Army Air Forces]], which was later absorbed into the U.S. [[Fourteenth Air Force]]. During their time in the Chinese Air Force, they succeeded in destroying 296 enemy aircraft,<ref name=\"Ford pp. 30\u201334\">Ford 1991, pp. 30\u201334.</ref> while losing only 14 pilots in combat.<ref name=\"Ford pp. 30\u201334\"/>\n\n===Command system===\nIn 1942 President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] set up a new command structure to provide leadership in the US Armed Forces while retaining authority as Commander-in-Chief as assisted by [[United States Secretary of War|Secretary of War]] [[Henry Stimson]] with Admiral [[Ernest J. King]] as [[Chief of Naval Operations]] in complete control of the [[United States Navy|Navy]] and of the [[United States Marine Corps|Marine Corps]] through its Commandant, then Lt. General [[Thomas Holcomb]] and his successor as [[Commandant of the Marine Corps]], Lt. General [[Alexander Vandegrift]], General [[George C. Marshall]] in charge of the [[United States Army|Army]], and in nominal control of the Air Force, which in practice was commanded by General [[Hap Arnold]] on Marshall's behalf. King was also in control for wartime being of the [[United States Coast Guard|US Coast Guard]] under its Commandant, Admiral [[Russell R. Waesche]]. Roosevelt formed a new body, the [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]], which made the final decisions on American military strategy and as the chief policy-making body for the armed forces. The Joint Chiefs was a White House agency chaired by Admiral [[William D. Leahy]], who became FDR's chief military advisor and the highest military officer of the US at that time.<ref>Henry H. Adams, ''Witness to Power: The Life of Fleet Admiral William D. Leahy'' (1985)</ref>\n\nAs the war progressed Marshall became the dominant voice in the JCS in the shaping of strategy.<ref>Grace P.

The [[Nazi Germany|German]] victories in [[Battle of France|France]], [[Invasion of Poland (1939)|Poland]] and elsewhere, combined with the [[Battle of Britain]], led many Americans to believe that some intervention would be needed. In March 1941, the [[Lend-Lease]] program began shipping money, munitions, and food to Britain, China, and (by that fall) the Soviet Union.\n\nBy 1941 the United States was taking an active part in the war, despite its nominal neutrality. In spring [[U-boat|U-boats]] began their \"wolf-pack\" tactics which threatened to sever the trans- Atlantic supply line; Roosevelt extended the [[Pan-American Security Zone]] east almost as far as [[Iceland]]. The US Navy's \"neutrality patrols\" were not actually neutral as, in practice, their function was to report Axis ship and submarine sightings to the British and Canadian navies, and from April the US Navy began escorting Allied convoys from Canada as far as the \"Mid-Atlantic Meeting Point\" (MOMP) south of Iceland, where they handed off to the RN.\n\nOn 16 June 1941, after negotiation with [[Winston Churchill|Churchill]], Roosevelt ordered the United States occupation of Iceland to replace the [[Invasion of Iceland|British invasion forces]]. On 22 June 1941, the US Navy sent Task Force 19 (TF 19) from [[Charleston, South Carolina]] to assemble at [[Argentia, Newfoundland]]. TF 19 included [[Invasion of Iceland#Task Force 19|25 warships]] and the [[1st Provisional Marine Brigade]] of 194 officers and 3714 men from [[San Diego, California]] under the command of Brigadier General John Marston.<ref name=\"morison\">{{cite book|title=The Battle of the Atlantic September 1939 \u2013 May 1943|author= Morison, Samuel Eliot|publisher=Little, Brown and Company|year=1975|pages=74\u201379}}</ref> Task Force 19 (TF 19) sailed from Argentia on 1 July. On 7 July, Britain persuaded the [[Althing]] to approve an American occupation force under a U.S.-Icelandic defense agreement, and TF 19 anchored off Reykjav\u00edk that evening. [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marines]] commenced landing on 8 July, and disembarkation was completed on 12 July. On 6 August, the [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] established an air base at Reykjav\u00edk with the arrival of Patrol Squadron VP-73 [[PBY Catalina]]s and VP-74 [[PBM Mariner]]s. [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] personnel began arriving in Iceland in August, and the Marines had been transferred to the Pacific by March 1942.<ref name=\"morison\"/> Up to 40,000 U.S. military personnel were stationed on the island, outnumbering adult Icelandic men (at the time, Iceland had a population of about 120,000.) The agreement was for the US military to remain until the end of the war (although the US military presence in Iceland [[Naval Air Station Keflavik#Deactivation|remained through 2006]], as postwar Iceland became a member of [[NATO]]).\n\nAmerican warships escorting Allied convoys in the western Atlantic had several hostile encounters with U-boats.  On 4 September, a German U-Boat attacked the destroyer {{USS|Greer|DD-145|6}} off Iceland. A week later Roosevelt ordered American warships to attack U-boats on sight. A U-boat shot up the {{USS|Kearny|DD-432|6}} as it escorted a British merchant convoy. The {{USS|Reuben James|DD-245|6}} was sunk by {{GS|U-552}} on 31 October 1941.<ref>George W.

This was because two of the Allied capitals, London and [[Moscow]], could be directly threatened by Germany, but none of the major Allied capitals were threatened by Japan.\nGermany was the United Kingdom's primary threat, especially after the Fall of France in 1940, which saw Germany overrun most of the countries of [[Western Europe]], leaving the United Kingdom alone to combat Germany. Germany's planned invasion of the UK, Operation Sea Lion, was averted by its failure to establish air superiority in the Battle of Britain. At the same time, war with Japan in East Asia seemed increasingly likely. Although the U.S. was not yet at war with either Germany or Japan, it met with the UK on several occasions to formulate joint strategies.\n\nIn the 29 March 1941 report of the [[U.S.\u2013British Staff Conference (ABC\u20131)|ABC-1 conference]], the Americans and British agreed that their strategic objectives were: (1) \"The early defeat of Germany as the predominant member of the Axis with the principal military effort of the United States being exerted in the Atlantic and European area; and (2) A strategic defensive in the [[Far East]].\"\nThus, the Americans concurred with the British in the grand strategy of \"Europe first\" (or \"Germany first\") in carrying out military operations in World War II. The UK feared that, if the United States was diverted from its main focus in Europe to the Pacific (Japan), Hitler might crush both the Soviet Union and Britain, and would then become an unconquerable fortress in Europe. The wound inflicted on the United States by Japan at Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941, did not result in a change in U.S. policy. Prime Minister Winston Churchill hastened to Washington shortly after Pearl Harbor for the Arcadia Conference to ensure that the Americans didn't have second thoughts about Europe First. The two countries reaffirmed that, \"notwithstanding the entry of Japan into the War, our view remains that Germany is still the prime enemy. And her defeat is the key to victory. Once Germany is defeated the collapse of Italy and the defeat of Japan must follow.\"\n\n===Battle of the Atlantic===\n{{Main|Battle of the Atlantic}}\nThe Battle of the Atlantic was the longest continuous military campaign in World War II, running from 1939 to the defeat of Germany in 1945. At its core was the [[Blockade of Germany (1939\u20131945)|Allied naval blockade of Germany]], announced the day after the declaration of war, and Germany's subsequent counter-blockade. It was at its height from mid-1940 through to the end of 1943. The Battle of the Atlantic pitted U-boats and other warships of the [[Kriegsmarine]] (German navy) and aircraft of the [[Luftwaffe]] (German Air Force) against the Royal Canadian Navy, Royal Navy, the United States Navy, and Allied merchant shipping. The convoys, coming mainly from [[North America]] and predominantly going to the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union, were protected for the most part by the British and Canadian navies and air forces. These forces were aided by ships and aircraft of the United States from 13 September 1941. The Germans were joined by submarines of the [[Regia Marina|Italian Royal Navy]] (Regia Marina) after their Axis ally Italy entered the war on 10 June 1940.\n\n===Operation Torch===\n{{Main|Operation Torch}}\n[[File:American troops on board a landing craft heading for the beaches at Oran in Algeria during Operation 'Torch', November 1942. A12661.jpg|thumb|American troops on board a landing craft going in to land at Oran.

General [[Dwight D. Eisenhower|Dwight Eisenhower]] commanded the assault on [[North Africa]], and Major General [[George S. Patton|George Patton]] struck at [[Casablanca]].\n\n===Allied victory in North Africa===\n{{Main|North African Campaign}}\n\nThe United States did not have a smooth entry into the war against [[Nazi Germany]]. Early in 1943, the [[U.S. Army]] suffered a near-disastrous defeat at the [[Battle of the Kasserine Pass]] in February. The senior Allied leadership was primarily to blame for the loss as internal bickering between American General [[Lloyd Fredendall]] and the British led to mistrust and little communication, causing inadequate troop placements.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20071211081444/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3723/is_200303/ai_n9222724 \"Command Failures: Lessons Learned from Lloyd R. Fredendall\"] Steven L. Ossad, findarticles.com</ref>  The defeat could be considered a major turning point, however, because General Eisenhower replaced Fredendall with General Patton.\n\nSlowly the Allies stopped the German advance in [[French protectorate of Tunisia|Tunisia]] and by March were pushing back. In mid April, under British General [[Bernard Law Montgomery, 1st Viscount Montgomery of Alamein|Bernard Montgomery]], the Allies smashed through the [[Mareth Line]] and broke the Axis defense in North Africa. On 13 May 1943, Axis troops in North Africa surrendered, leaving behind 275,000 men. Allied efforts turned towards Sicily and Italy.\n[[File:ItalyDefenseLinesSouthofRome1943 4.jpg|thumb|300px|The situation south of Rome showing German prepared defensive lines]]\n\n===Invasion of Sicily and Italy===\n{{Main|Allied invasion of Sicily|Allied invasion of Italy}}\n\nThe first stepping stone for the Allied liberation of Europe was invading Europe through Italy. Launched on 9 July 1943, Operation Husky was, at the time, the largest [[Amphibious warfare|amphibious]] operation ever undertaken. The American seaborne assault by the [[U.S. 7th Army]]  landed on the southern coast of Sicily between the town of Licata in the west, and Scoglitti in the east and units of the 82nd airborne division parachuted ahead of landings. Despite the elements, the operation was a success and the Allies immediately began exploiting their gains. On 11 August, seeing that the battle was lost, the German and Italian commanders began evacuating their forces from Sicily to Italy. On 17 August, the Allies were in control of the island, U.S. 7th Army lost 8,781 men (2,237 killed or missing, 5,946 wounded, and 598 captured).\n\nFollowing the Allied victory in Sicily, Italian public sentiment swung against the war and Italian dictator [[Benito Mussolini]]. He was dismissed from office by the [[Grand Council of Fascism|Fascist Grand Council]] and [[Victor Emmanuel III of Italy|King Victor Emmanuel III]], and the Allies struck quickly, hoping resistance would be slight. The first Allied troops landed on the Italian peninsula on 3 September 1943 and Italy surrendered on 8 September, however the [[Italian Social Republic]] was established soon afterwards. The first American troops landed at Salerno on 9 September 1943, by [[U.S. 5th Army]], however, German troops in Italy were prepared and after the Allied troops at Salerno had consolidated their beachhead, The Germans launched fierce counterattacks. However, they failed to destroy the beachhead and retreated on 16 September and in October 1943 began preparing a series of defensive lines across central Italy. The US 5th Army and other Allied armies broke through the first two lines ([[Volturno Line|Volturno]] and the [[Barbara Line]]) in October and November 1943. As winter approached, the Allies made slow progress due to the weather and the difficult terrain against the heavily defended German Winter Line; they did however manage to break through the [[Bernhardt Line]] in January 1944. By early 1944 the Allied attention had turned to the western front and the Allies were taking heavy losses trying to break through the Winter Line at [[Battle of Monte Cassino|Monte Cassino]]. The Allies landed at [[Battle of Anzio|Anzio]] on 22 January 1944 with the aim of outflanking the Gustav line and pulling Axis forces out of it so other allied armies could breakthrough. After slow progress, the Germans counterattacked in February but failed to stamp out the Allies; after months of stalemate, the Allies broke out in May 1944 and Rome fell to the Allies on 4 June 1944.\n\nFollowing the Normandy invasion on 6 June 1944, the equivalent of seven US and French divisions were pulled out of Italy to participate in Operation Dragoon: the allied landings in southern France; despite this, the remaining US forces in Italy with other Allied forces pushed up to the [[Gothic line]] in northern Italy, the last major defensive line. From August 1944 to March 1945 the Allies managed to breach the formidable defenses but they narrowly failed to break out into the Lombardy Plains before the winter weather closed in and made further progress impossible. In April 1945 the Allies broke through the remaining Axis positions in [[Spring 1945 offensive in Italy|Operation Grapeshot]] ending the Italian Campaign on 2 May 1945; US forces in mainland Italy suffered between 114,000 and over 119,000 casualties.\n\n===Strategic bombing===\n{{Main|Strategic bombing during World War II#US bombing in Europe|Air warfare of World War II#United States: Army Air Forces}}\n{{stack begin}}\n[[File:Bomber stream.jpg|thumb|250px|alt=|B-17s in flight]]\n[[File:James H. Doolittle.jpg|thumb|250px|alt=|Maj. Gen. [[Jimmy Doolittle]], 8th Air Force Commander from January 1944 to V-E Day]]\n[[File:North American P-51 Mustang.JPG|thumb|North American P-51 Mustang, 26 July 1944]]\n[[File:Republic P-47D-22-RE Thunderbolt (sn 42-25969).jpg|thumb|Republic P-47D Thunderbolt, 1943]]\n{{stack end}}\n\nNumerous bombing runs were launched by the United States aimed at the industrial heart of Germany. Using the high altitude [[Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress|B-17]], it was necessary for the raids to be conducted in daylight for the drops to be accurate. As adequate fighter escort was rarely available, the bombers would fly [[Combat box|in tight, box formations]], allowing each bomber to provide overlapping [[Browning M2|machine-gun]] fire for defense. The tight formations made it impossible to evade fire from ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' fighters, however, and American bomber crew losses were high. One such example was the [[Schweinfurt-Regensburg mission]], which resulted in staggering losses of men and equipment. The introduction of the revered [[P-51 Mustang]], which had enough fuel to make a round trip to Germany's heartland, helped to reduce losses later in the war.\n\nIn mid-1942, the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) arrived in the UK and carried out a few raids across the [[English Channel]]. The USAAF [[Eighth Air Force|Eighth Air Force's]] B-17 bombers were called the \"Flying Fortresses\" because of their heavy defensive armament of ten to twelve machine guns, and armor plating in vital locations. In part because of their heavier armament and armor, they carried smaller bomb loads than British bombers. With all of this, the USAAF's commanders in Washington, DC, and in Great Britain adopted the strategy of taking on the Luftwaffe head on, in larger and larger air raids by mutually defending bombers, flying over Germany, Austria, and France at high altitudes during the daytime. Also, both the U.S. Government and its Army Air Forces commanders were reluctant to bomb enemy cities and towns indiscriminately. They claimed that by using the B-17 and the [[Norden bombsight]], the USAAF should be able to carry out \"precision bombing\" on locations vital to the German war machine: factories, naval bases, shipyards, railroad yards, railroad junctions, power plants, steel mills, airfields, etc.\n\nIn January 1943, at the [[Casablanca Conference]], it was agreed [[RAF Bomber Command]] operations against Germany would be reinforced by the USAAF in a Combined Operations Offensive plan called Operation Pointblank. Chief of the British Air Staff MRAF Sir [[Charles Portal, 1st Viscount Portal of Hungerford|Charles Portal]] was put in charge of the \"strategic direction\" of both British and American bomber operations. The text of the Casablanca directive read: \"Your primary object will be the progressive destruction and dislocation of the German military, industrial and economic system and the undermining of the morale of the German people to a point where their capacity for armed resistance is fatally weakened.\", At the beginning of the combined strategic bombing offensive on 4 March 1943 669 RAF and 303 USAAF heavy bombers were available.\n\nIn the late 1943, the 'Pointblank' attacks manifested themselves in the infamous Schweinfurt raids (first and second). Formations of unescorted bombers were no match for German fighters, which inflicted a deadly toll. In despair, the Eighth halted air operations over Germany until a long-range fighter could be found in 1944; it proved to be the P-51 Mustang, which had the range to fly to Berlin and back.\n\nUSAAF leaders firmly held to the claim of \"precision bombing\" of military targets for much of the war, and dismissed claims they were simply bombing cities. However the American Eighth Air Force received the first [[H2X|H2X radar]] sets in December 1943. Within two weeks of the arrival of these first six sets, the Eighth command gave permission for them to area bomb a city using H2X and would continue to authorize, on average, about one such attack a week until the end of the war in Europe.\n\nIn reality, the day bombing was \"precision bombing\" only in the sense that most bombs fell somewhere near a specific designated target such as a railway yard. Conventionally, the air forces designated as \"the target area\" a circle having a radius of 1000 feet around the aiming point of attack. While accuracy improved during the war, Survey studies show that, in the over-all, only about 20% of the bombs aimed at precision targets fell within this target area. In the fall of 1944, only seven percent of all bombs dropped by the Eighth Air Force hit within 1,000 feet of their aim point. The only offensive ordnance possessed by the USAAF that was guidable, the VB-1 [[Azon]], saw very limited service in both Europe and in the [[CBI Theater]] late in the war.\n\nNevertheless, the sheer tonnage of explosive delivered by day and by night was eventually sufficient to cause widespread damage, and, more importantly from a military point of view, forced Germany to divert resources to counter it. This was to be the real significance of the Allied strategic bombing campaign\u2014resource allocation.\nFor the sake of improving the US air-force Fire bombing capabilities a mock-up German Village was built up and repeatedly burned down. It contained full-scale replicas of German residential homes. Fire bombing attacks proved quite successful, in a single 1943 attack on Hamburg roughly 50,000 civilians were killed and practically the entire city destroyed.\n\nWith the arrival of the brand-new [[Fifteenth Air Force]], based in Italy, command of the U.S. Air Forces in Europe was consolidated into the [[United States Strategic Air Forces in Europe|United States Strategic Air Forces]] (USSTAF). With the addition of the Mustang to its strength, the Combined Bomber Offensive was resumed. Planners targeted the Luftwaffe in an operation known as '[[Big Week]]' (20\u201325 February 1944) and succeeded brilliantly \u2013 losses were so heavy German planners were forced into a hasty dispersal of industry and the day fighter arm never fully recovered.\n\nThe dismissal of General [[Ira Eaker]] at the end of 1943 as commander of the [[Eighth Air Force]] and his replacement by American aviation legend, Maj. Gen [[Jimmy Doolittle]] signaled a change in how the American bombing effort went forward over Europe. Doolittle's major influence on the European air war occurred early in the year when he changed the policy requiring escorting fighters to remain with the bombers at all times. With his permission, initially performed with [[P-38]]s and [[P-47 Thunderbolt|P-47]]s with both previous types being  steadily replaced with the long-ranged [[P-51 Mustang|P-51]]s as the spring of 1944 wore on, American fighter pilots on bomber defense missions would primarily be flying far ahead of the bombers' [[combat box]] formations in [[air supremacy]] mode, literally \"clearing the skies\" of any [[Luftwaffe]] fighter opposition heading towards the target. This strategy fatally disabled the twin-engined ''Zerst\u00f6rergeschwader'' [[heavy fighter]] wings and their replacement, single-engined ''Sturmgruppen'' of [[Focke-Wulf Fw 190 operational history#The Sturmb\u00f6cke|heavily armed Fw 190As]], clearing each force of [[bomber destroyer]]s in their turn from Germany's skies throughout most of 1944. As part of this game-changing strategy, especially after the bombers had hit their targets, the USAAF's fighters were then free to strafe German airfields and transport while returning to base, contributing significantly to the achievement of air superiority by Allied air forces over Europe.\n\nOn 27 March 1944, the Combined Chiefs of Staff issued orders granting control of all the Allied air forces in Europe, including strategic bombers, to General Dwight D. Eisenhower, the [[Supreme Allied Commander]], who delegated command to his deputy in [[Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force|SHAEF]] Air Chief Marshal [[Arthur Tedder, 1st Baron Tedder|Arthur Tedder]]. There was resistance to this order from some senior figures, including Winston Churchill, Harris, and [[Carl Spaatz]], but after some debate, control passed to SHAEF on 1 April 1944. When the Combined Bomber Offensive officially ended on 1 April, Allied airmen were well on the way to achieving air superiority over all of Europe. While they continued some strategic bombing, the USAAF along with the RAF turned their attention to the tactical air battle in support of the Normandy Invasion. It was not until the middle of September that the strategic bombing campaign of Germany again became the priority for the USSTAF.\n\nThe twin campaigns\u2014the USAAF by day, the RAF by night\u2014built up into massive bombing of German industrial areas, notably the [[Ruhr]], followed by attacks directly on cities such as [[Hamburg]], [[Kassel]], [[Pforzheim]], [[Mainz]] and the often-criticized [[Bombing of Dresden in World War II|bombing of Dresden]].\n\n===Operation Overlord===\n[[File:Eisenhower d-day.jpg|thumb|250px|alt=|General Eisenhower speaks with members of the 101st Airborne Division on the evening of 5 June 1944]]\n[[File:Approaching Omaha.jpg|thumb|250px|alt=|American troops approaching Omaha Beach]]\n[[File:2nd Infantry Division, E-1 draw, Easy Red sector, Omaha Beach, D+1, June 7, 1944.jpg|thumb|250px|alt=|[[2nd Infantry Division (United States)|2nd Infantry Division]] troops and equipment going up the bluff from Omaha Beach to [[Saint-Laurent-sur-Mer]] on D+1, June 7, 1944.]]\n[[File:Germanprisonerscherbourg.jpg|thumb|250px|German prisoners of war escorted by American soldiers in Cherbourg, 1944.]]\n{{Main|Operation Overlord}}\nThe second European front that the Soviets had pressed for was finally opened on 6 June 1944, when the Allies launched an [[invasion of Normandy]].\nSupreme Allied commander General Dwight D. Eisenhower had delayed the attack because of bad weather, but finally the largest amphibious assault in history began.\n\nAfter prolonged bombing runs on the French coast by the Army Air Forces, 225 [[U.S. Army Rangers]] scaled the cliffs at [[Pointe du Hoc]] under intense enemy fire and destroyed the German gun emplacements that could have threatened the amphibious landings. Also prior to the main amphibious assault, the American [[U.S. 82nd Airborne Division|82nd]] and [[101st Airborne Division|101st]] Airborne divisions dropped behind the beaches into [[German military administration in occupied France during World War II|Nazi-occupied France]], in an effort to protect the coming landings. Many of the [[paratrooper]]s were not dropped on their intended landing zones and were scattered throughout Normandy.\n\nAs the paratroops fought their way through the [[hedgerow]]s, the main amphibious landings began. The Americans came ashore at the beaches codenamed '[[Omaha Beach|Omaha]]' and '[[Utah Beach|Utah]]'. The landing craft bound for Utah, as with so many other units, went off course, coming ashore two kilometers off target. The [[U.S. 4th Infantry Division|4th Infantry Division]] faced weak resistance during the landings and by the afternoon were linked up with paratroopers fighting their way towards the coast.\n\nAt Omaha the Germans had prepared the beaches with [[land mine]]s, [[Czech hedgehog]]s and [[Belgian Gate]]s in anticipation of the invasion. Intelligence prior to the landings had placed the less experienced German 714th Division in charge of the defense of the beach. However, the highly trained and experienced 352nd moved in days before the invasion. As a result, the soldiers from the [[U.S. 1st Infantry Division|1st]] and [[U.S. 29th Infantry Division|29th]] Infantry Divisions became pinned down by superior enemy fire immediately after leaving their landing craft. In some instances, entire landing craft full of men were mowed down by the well-positioned German defenses. As the casualties mounted, the soldiers formed impromptu units and advanced inland.\n\nThe small units then fought their way through the minefields that were in between the Nazi machine-gun bunkers. After squeezing through, they then attacked the bunkers from the rear, allowing more men to come safely ashore.\n\nBy the end of the day, the Americans suffered over 6,000 casualties. [[Omaha Beach]] is the code name for one of the five sectors of the Allied invasion of German-occupied France in the Normandy landings on 6 June 1944, during World War II. The beach is located on the coast of Normandy, France, facing the English Channel, and is 5 miles (8&nbsp;km) long, from east of [[Sainte-Honorine-des-Pertes]] to west of [[Vierville-sur-Mer]] on the right bank of the [[Douve|Douve River]] estuary. Landings here were necessary in order to link up the British landings to the east at [[Gold Beach]] with the American landing to the west at [[Utah Beach]], thus providing a continuous lodgement on the Normandy coast of the [[Baie de la Seine|Bay of the Seine]]. Taking Omaha was to be the responsibility of United States Army troops, with sea transport and naval artillery support provided by the U.S. Navy and elements of the British Royal Navy.\n \nOn D-Day, the untested 29th Infantry Division, joined by the veteran 1st Infantry Division and nine companies of [[United States Army Rangers|U.S. Army Rangers]] redirected from [[Pointe du Hoc]], were to assault the western half of the beach. The battle-hardened 1st Infantry Division was given the eastern half. The initial assault waves, consisting of tanks, infantry, and combat engineer forces, were carefully planned to reduce the coastal defenses and allow the larger ships of the follow-up waves to land.\n \nThe primary objective at Omaha was to secure a beachhead of some five miles (eight kilometers) depth, between [[Port-en-Bessin-Huppain|Port-en-Bessin]] and the [[Vire (river)|Vire River]], linking with the British landings at Gold Beach to the east, and reaching the area of [[Isigny-sur-Mer|Isigny]] to the west to link up with [[VII Corps (United States)|VII Corps]] landing at Utah Beach. Opposing the landings was the German [[352nd Infantry Division]], a large portion of whom were teenagers, though they were supplemented by veterans who had fought on the Eastern Front. The 352nd had never had any battalion or regimental training. Of the 12,020 men of the division, only 6,800 were experienced combat troops, detailed to defend a 53-kilometer-long (33-mile) front. The Germans were largely deployed in strongpoints along the coast\u2014the German strategy was based on defeating any seaborne assault at the water line. Nevertheless, Allied calculations indicated that Omaha's defenses were three times as strong as those they had encountered during the Battle of Kwajalein, and its defenders were four times as many.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\nVery little went as planned during the landing at Omaha Beach. Difficulties in navigation caused the majority of landing craft to miss their targets throughout the day. The defenses were unexpectedly strong, and inflicted heavy casualties on landing US troops. Under heavy fire, the engineers struggled to clear the beach obstacles; later landings bunched up around the few channels that were cleared. Weakened by the casualties taken just in landing, the surviving assault troops could not clear the heavily defended exits off the beach. This caused further problems and consequent delays for later landings. Small penetrations were eventually achieved by groups of survivors making improvised assaults, scaling the bluffs between the most heavily defended points. By the end of the day, two small isolated footholds had been won, which were subsequently exploited against weaker defenses further inland, thus achieving the original D-Day objectives over the following days\uff0e\n\nWith the Beaches secured, the Allies needed to secure a deep-water port to allow reinforcements to be brought in, with American forces at the base of the [[Cotentin Peninsula]] the target was [[Battle of Cherbourg|Cherbourg]], at the end of the Cotentin. The US [[VII Corps (United States)|VII Corps]] immediately began making their push after the beaches were secured on 6 June, facing mix of weak regiments and battlegroups from several divisions who used the [[bocage]] terrain, flooded fields and narrow roads to their advantage which slowed the American advance. After being reinforced, VII corps took control of the peninsula in fierce fighting on 19 June and launched their assault on Cherbourg on 22 June. The German garrison surrendered on 29 June, but by this time they had destroyed the port facilities, which were not made fully operational until September.{{sfn|Ford|Zaloga|2009|pp=185\u2013193}}\n\n===Battle of Saint-L\u00f4 ===\n{{Main|Battle of Saint-L\u00f4}}\nThe Battle of Saint-L\u00f4 is one of the three conflicts in the Battle of the Hedgerows (fr), which took place between 9\u201324 July 1944, just before Operation Cobra. Saint-L\u00f4 had fallen to Germany in 1940, and, after the Invasion of Normandy, the Americans targeted the city, as it served as a strategic crossroads. American bombardments caused heavy damage (up to 95% of the city was destroyed) and a high number of casualties, which resulted in the martyr city being called \"The Capital of Ruins\", popularized in a report by Samuel Beckett\n\n===Battle of Carentan ===\n{{Main|Battle of Carentan}}\nThe Battle of Carentan was an engagement between airborne forces of the United States Army and the German Wehrmacht during the Battle of Normandy. The battle took place between 10\u201315 June 1944, on the approaches to and within the city of [[Carentan]], France.\n\nThe objective of the attacking American forces was consolidation of the U.S. beachheads (Utah Beach and Omaha Beach) and establishment of a continuous defensive line against expected German counterattacks. The defending German force attempted to hold the city long enough to allow reinforcements en route from the south to arrive, prevent or delay the merging of the lodgments, and keep the U.S. First Army from launching an attack towards Lessay-P\u00e9riers that would cut off the [[Cotentin Peninsula]].\n\nCarentan was defended by two battalions of Fallschirmj\u00e4ger-Regiment 6 (6th Parachute Regiment) of the 2nd Fallschirmj\u00e4ger-Division and two Ost battalions. The 17th SS Panzergrenadier Division, ordered to reinforce Carentan, was delayed by transport shortages and attacks by Allied aircraft. The attacking 101st Airborne Division, landed by parachute on 6 June as part of the American airborne landings in Normandy, was ordered to seize Carentan.\n\nIn the ensuing battle, the 101st forced passage across the causeway into Carentan on 10\u201311 June. A lack of ammunition forced the German forces to withdraw on 12 June. The 17th SS PzG Division counter-attacked the 101st Airborne on 13 June. Initially successful, its attack was thrown back by Combat Command A (CCA) of the U.S. 2nd Armored Division\n\n===Operation Cobra===\n{{Main|Operation Cobra}}\nAfter the amphibious assault, the Allied forces remained stalled in Normandy for some time, advancing much more slowly than expected with close-fought infantry battles in the dense hedgerows. However, with Operation Cobra, launched on 24 July with mostly American troops, the Allies succeeded in breaking the German lines and sweeping out into France with fast-moving armored divisions. This led to a major defeat for the Germans, with 400,000 soldiers trapped in the [[Falaise pocket]], and the capture of Paris on 25 August.\n\n===Operation L\u00fcttich===\n{{main|Operation L\u00fcttich}}\n\nOperation L\u00fcttich was a code name given to a German counter-attack during the Battle of Normandy, which took place around the American positions near Mortain from 7\u201313 August 1944. (L\u00fcttich is the German name for the city of Li\u00e8ge in Belgium, where the Germans had won a victory in the early days of August 1914 during World War I.) The offensive is also referred to in American and British histories of the Battle of Normandy as the Mortain counter-offensive.\n\nThe assault was ordered by Adolf Hitler, to eliminate the gains made by the First United States Army during Operation Cobra and the subsequent weeks, and by reaching the coast in the region of Avranches at the base of the Cotentin peninsula, cut off the units of the Third United States Army which had advanced into Brittany.\n\nThe main German striking force was the [[XLVII Panzer Corps]], with one and a half SS Panzer Divisions and two Wehrmacht Panzer Divisions. Although they made initial gains against the defending U.S. VII Corps, they were soon halted and Allied aircraft inflicted severe losses on the attacking troops, eventually destroying nearly half of the German tanks involved in the attack.[2] Although fighting continued around Mortain for six days, the American forces had regained the initiative within a day of the opening of the German attack.\n\nAs the German commanders on the spot had warned Hitler in vain, there was little chance of the attack succeeding, and the concentration of their armored reserves at the western end of the front in Normandy soon led to disaster, as they were outflanked to their south and the front to their east collapsed, resulting in many of the German troops in Normandy being trapped in the Falaise Pocket.\n\n===Falaise Pocket===\n{{main|Falaise Pocket}}\nFollowing Operation Cobra, the American breakout from the Normandy beachhead, rapid advances were made to the south and south-east by the [[United States Army Central|Third U.S. Army]] under the command of General George Patton. Despite lacking the resources to defeat the U.S. breakthrough and simultaneous British and Canadian offensives south of [[Caumont-l'\u00c9vent\u00e9|Caumont]] and [[Caen]], Field Marshal [[G\u00fcnther von Kluge]], the commander of [[Army Group B]], was not permitted by Hitler to withdraw but was ordered to conduct a counter-offensive at [[Mortain]] against the U.S. breakthrough. Four depleted panzer divisions were not enough to defeat the First U.S. Army. Operation L\u00fcttich was a disaster, which drove the Germans deeper into the Allied envelopment.\n\nOn 8 August, the Allied ground forces commander, General Bernard Montgomery, ordered the Allied armies to converge on the Falaise\u2013Chambois area to envelop Army Group B, the First U.S. Army forming the southern arm, the [[Second Army (United Kingdom)|British Second Army]] the base and the [[First Canadian Army]] the northern arm of the encirclement. The Germans began to withdraw on 17\u201319 August, and the Allies linked up in Chambois. Gaps were forced in the Allied lines by German counter-attacks, the biggest being a corridor forced past the [[1st Armoured Division (Poland)|1st Polish Armored Division]] on [[Hill 262]], a commanding position at the mouth of the pocket. By the evening of 21 August, the pocket had been sealed, with c.\u200950,000 Germans trapped inside. Many Germans escaped but losses in men and equipment were huge. Two days later the Allied Liberation of Paris was completed and on 30 August, the remnants of Army Group B retreated across the Seine, which ended Operation Overlord.\n\n===Operation Dragoon===\n{{main|Operation Dragoon}}\nOn 15 August 1944, the [[Seventh United States Army|US 7th Army]], spearheaded by the [[3rd Infantry Division (United States)|3rd Infantry Division]] and [[36th Infantry Division (United States)|36th Infantry Division]] and other Allied forces landed in southern France between [[Cannes]] and [[Hy\u00e8res]]. The aim of the operation was to secure the southern half of France and one objective in particular was to capture [[Marseille]] as a main supply harbor for the Allies in France. The operation was a success and forced the German [[Army Group G]] to abandon southern France and to retreat under constant Allied attacks to the [[Vosges Mountains]]. By the time the operation finished on 14 September 1944, US forces suffered 2,050 killed, captured or missing 7,750 other casualties, on 15 September 1944 the Allied forces of the operation were renamed the [[Sixth United States Army Group|Sixth Army Group]] and placed under Eisenhower's command.\n\n===Operation Market Garden===\n{{Main|Operation Market Garden}}\n{{See also|Operation Market Garden order of battle}}\n\n[[File:Waves of paratroops land in Holland.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Paratroopers landing in the Netherlands.]]\n\nThe next major Allied operation came on 17 September. Devised by British General Bernard Montgomery, its primary objective was the capture of several bridges in the Netherlands. Fresh off of their successes in Normandy, the Allies were optimistic that an attack on the Nazi-occupied Netherlands would force open a route across the [[Rhine]] and onto the [[Northern European Lowlands|North German Plain]]. Such an opening would allow Allied forces to break out northward and advance toward [[Denmark]] and, ultimately, Berlin.\n\nThe plan involved a daylight drop of the American 82nd and 101st Airborne Divisions. The 101st was to capture the bridges at [[Eindhoven]], with the 82nd taking the bridges at [[Grave, Netherlands|Grave]] and [[Nijmegen]]. After the bridges had been captured, the ground force, also known as [[XXX Corps (United Kingdom)|XXX Corps]] or \"Garden\", would drive up a single road and link up with the paratroops.\n\nThe operation failed because the Allies were unable to capture the bridge furthest to the north at [[Arnhem]]. There, the [[1st Airborne Division (United Kingdom)|British 1st Airborne]] had been dropped to secure the bridges, but upon landing they discovered that a highly experienced German [[9th SS Panzer Division Hohenstaufen|SS Panzer unit]] was garrisoning the town. The paratroopers were only lightly equipped in respect to anti-tank weaponry and quickly lost ground. Failure to quickly relieve those members of the 1st who had managed to seize the bridge at Arnhem on the part of the armored [[XXX Corps (United Kingdom)|XXX Corps]], meant that the Germans were able to stymie the entire operation. In the end, the operation's ambitious nature, the fickle state of war, and failures on the part of Allied intelligence (as well as tenacious German defense) can be blamed for Market-Garden's ultimate failure. This operation also signaled the last time that either the 82nd or 101st would make a combat jump during the war.\n\n===Operation Queen===\n{{Main|Battle of H\u00fcrtgen Forest|Operation Queen}}\nUnable to push north into the Netherlands, the Allies in western Europe were forced to consider other options to get into Germany. In the summer of 1944, the Allies suffered from a large supply crisis, due to the long supply route.  But by the fall of 1944, this has largely been resolved ([[Red Ball Express]]). As part of the [[Allied advance from Paris to the Rhine|Siegfriend Line Campaign]], the Allies tried to push into Germany towards the Rhine. As a first step, [[Aachen]] was captured during a [[Battle of Aachen|heavy battle]]. The Germans now had the advantage of their old fortification system, the [[Siegfried line]]. During the [[Battle of H\u00fcrtgen Forest]], the Allies fought a long battle of attrition with the Germans, which ended initially in a stalemate, with the Allies unable to take the complete forest. The battle of the H\u00fcrtgen Forest was later absorbed by a larger offensive, [[Operation Queen]]. During this offensive, the Allies intended to push towards the Ruhr, as a staging point for a subsequent thrust over the river to the [[Rhine]] into Germany. However, against underestimated and stiffened German resistance, the Allies were only able to make slow progress. By mid-December the Allies were finally at the Rur, but by then the Germans had prepared their own offensive through the Ardennes, which was launched in the midst of an unsuccessful Allied attack against the Rur dams.\n\n===Battle of the Bulge===\n{{Main|Battle of the Bulge|Battle of Bastogne|Operation Nordwind}}\n\n[[File:Wacht am Rhein map.svg|thumb|150px|The \"bulge\" created by the German offensive.]]\n[[File:American tank destroyers.jpg|thumb|150px|American tank destroyers move forward during heavy fog to stem German spearhead near Werbomont, Belgium, 20 December 1944.]]\n[[File:101st Airborne troops move out of Bastogne.jpg|thumb|150px|Troops of the 101st Airborne move out of Bastogne, after having been besieged there for ten days, 31 December 1944.]]\n\nOn 16 December 1944, the Germans launched a massive attack westward in the [[Ardennes]] forest, along a battlefront extending southwards from [[Monschau]] to [[Echternach]], hoping to punch a hole in the Allied lines and capture the Belgian city of [[Antwerp]]. The Allies responded slowly, allowing  the German attack to create a large \"bulge\" in the Allied lines. In the initial stages of the offensive, American [[POW]]<nowiki/>s from the [[285th Field Artillery Observation Battalion]] were executed at the [[Malmedy massacre]] by Nazi [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] and [[Fallschirmj\u00e4ger (World War II)|Fallschirmj\u00e4ger]].\n\nAs the Germans pushed westward, General Eisenhower ordered the 101st Airborne and elements of the [[U.S. 10th Armored Division]] into the road junction town of [[Bastogne]] to prepare a defense. The town quickly became cut off and surrounded. The winter weather slowed Allied air support, and the defenders were outnumbered and low on supplies. When given a request for their surrender from the Germans, General [[Anthony McAuliffe]], acting commander of the 101st, replied, \"Nuts!\", contributing to the stubborn American defense.<ref>[http://www.thedropzone.org/europe/Bulge/kinnard.html \"\"NUTS!\" Revisited: An Interview with Lt.

Patton then turned his army, at the time on the front in [[Luxembourg]], north to break through to Bastogne. Patton's armor pushed north, and by 26 December was in Bastogne, effectively ending the siege. By the time it was over, more American soldiers had served in the battle than in any engagement in American history.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20041215114142/http://www.defenselink.mil/news/Dec2004/n12142004_2004121406.html \"Battle of the Bulge remembered 60 years later\".] defenselink.mil</ref>\n\nOn 31 December, the Germans launched their last major offensive of the war on the Western Front, [[Operation Nordwind]], in [[Alsace]] and [[Lorraine (province)|Lorraine]] in northeastern France. Against weakened American forces there, the Germans were able to push the Americans back to the south bank of the [[Moder River]] on 21 January. On 25 January, Allied reinforcements from the Ardennes arrived, the German offensive was stopped and in fierce fighting the so-called [[Colmar Pocket]] was eliminated.\n\nThe German offensive was supported by several subordinate operations known as Unternehmen Bodenplatte, Greif, and W\u00e4hrung. Germany's goal for these operations was to split the British and American Allied line in half, capturing Antwerp and then proceed to encircle and destroy four Allied armies, forcing the Western Allies to negotiate a peace treaty in favor of the Axis powers. Once accomplished, Hitler could fully concentrate on the eastern theater of war.\n \nThe offensive was planned with the utmost secrecy, minimizing radio traffic and moving troops and equipment under cover of darkness. The Third U.S. Army's intelligence staff predicted a major German offensive, and [[Ultra]] indicated that a \"substantial and offensive\" operation was expected or \"in the wind\", although a precise date or point of attack could not be given. Aircraft movement from the Soviet Front to the Ardennes and transport of forces by rail to the Ardennes was noticed but not acted upon, according to a report later written by [[Peter Calvocoressi]] and [[F. L. Lucas]] at the code breaking center [[Bletchley Park]].\n \nNear-complete surprise was achieved by a combination of Allied overconfidence, preoccupation with Allied offensive plans, and poor aerial reconnaissance. The Germans attacked a weakly defended section of the Allied line, taking advantage of a heavy overcast, which grounded the Allies' overwhelmingly superior air forces. Fierce resistance on the northern shoulder of the offensive around [[Battle of Elsenborn Ridge|Elsenborn Ridge]] and in the south around [[Siege of Bastogne|Bastogne]] blocked German access to key roads to the west that they counted on for success. This and terrain that favored the defenders threw the German timetable behind schedule and allowed the Allies to reinforce the thinly placed troops. Improved weather conditions permitted air attacks on German forces and supply lines, which sealed the failure of the offensive. In the wake of the defeat, many experienced German units were left severely depleted of men and equipment, as survivors retreated to the defenses of the Siegfried Line.\n \nWith about 610,000 men committed and some 89,000 casualties, including 19,000 killed, the Battle of the Bulge was the largest and bloodiest battle fought by the United States in World War II.\n\n===Colmar Pocket ===\n{{Main|Colmar Pocket}}\nThe Colmar Pocket (French: Poche de Colmar; German: Br\u00fcckenkopf Elsa\u00df) was the area held in central [[Alsace]], France by the [[19th Army (Wehrmacht)|German Nineteenth Army]] from November 1944 \u2013 February 1945, against the U.S. 6th Army Group during World War II.

On the Western Front the Allies had been fighting in Germany since the [[Battle of Aachen]] in October 1944 and by January had turned back the Germans in the Battle of the Bulge. The failure of this last major German offensive exhausted much of Germany's remaining combat strength, leaving it ill-prepared to resist the final Allied campaigns in Europe. Additional losses in the Rhineland further weakened the German Army, leaving shattered remnants of units to defend the east bank of the Rhine. On 7 March, the Allies seized the last remaining intact bridge across the Rhine at Remagen, and had established a large bridgehead on the river's east bank. During [[Operation Lumberjack]] and [[Operation Plunder]] in February\u2013March 1945, German casualties are estimated at 400,000 men, including 280,000 men captured as prisoners of war.\n\n===South German Offensive===\n\nThe South German Offensive is the general name of one of the final offensives of World War II in Europe. The offensive was led by the Seventh and Third armies of the United States along with the [[1st Army (France)|First Army of France]]. Soviet troops linked up with American forces in [[Czechoslovakia]] notably in the [[Battle of Slivice]].{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} The offensive was made by the US 6th Army Group to protect the 12th Army Group's right flank and to prevent a German last stand in the Alps. However German resistance was much more fierce than in the north, which slowed the 6th Army Group's progress. However, by the end of April, many German divisions surrendered without a fight to the advancing American forces to avoid the inevitable destruction. The [[VI Corps (United States)|VI Corps]] of the Seventh Army linked up with the [[US Fifth Army]], which fought through Italy, in the Alps as the Third Army advanced into [[Austria]] and Czechoslovakia, where it linked up with Soviet forces advancing from the east. Fighting continued a few days after the [[German Instrument of Surrender|Surrender of Germany]] on 8 May, due to German forces fighting west to surrender to the Americans instead of the Soviets.\n\n===Race to Berlin===\nFollowing the defeat of the German army in the Ardennes, the Allies pushed back towards the Rhine and the heart of Germany. With the capture of the [[Ludendorff Bridge]] at [[Remagen]], the Allies crossed the Rhine in March 1945. The Americans then executed a [[pincer movement]], setting up the [[U.S. Ninth Army|Ninth Army]] north, and the [[U.S. First Army|First Army]] south. When the Allies closed the pincer, 300,000 Germans were captured in the [[Ruhr Pocket]]. The Americans then turned east, first meeting up with the Soviets at [[Torgau]] on the [[Elbe River]] in April. The Germans surrendered Berlin to the Soviets on 2 May 1945.\n\nThe war in Europe came to an official end on [[Victory in Europe Day|V-E Day]], 8 May 1945.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.historynet.com/world-war-ii|title= World War II|last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= |website= Historynet.com|publisher= |accessdate= 13 January 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Pacific Theater==\n{{Main|Pacific War}}\n{{See also|Asiatic-Pacific Theater}}\n[[File:Ww2-asia-overview.gif|thumb|350px|The conquests of Imperial Japan.]]\n\n===The Attack on Pearl Harbor===\n[[File:Pearlharborcolork13513.jpg|thumb|Explosion of the battleship {{USS|Arizona|BB-39|6}} at Pearl Harbor.]]\n{{Main|Attack on Pearl Harbor}}\n\nBecause of Japanese advances in [[French Indochina]] and China, the United States, in coordination with the British and Dutch, cut off all oil supplies to Japan, which had imported 90% of its oil. The oil embargo threatened to grind the Japanese military machine to a halt. Japan refused American demands to leave China and decided that war with the United States was inevitable; its only hope was to strike first. President Roosevelt had months earlier transferred the American fleet to Hawaii from California in order to deter the Japanese. Admiral [[Isoroku Yamamoto]] argued the only way to win the war was to knock out the powerful main American fleet immediately. His fleet approached within 200 miles of Hawaii without being detected. Admiral [[Ch\u016bichi Nagumo]] held tactical command. Over a five-hour period his six carriers sent two waves of 360 dive-bombers, torpedo planes, and fighters. They destroyed or severely damaged eight battleships, ten smaller warships, and 230 aircraft; 2,403 American servicemen and civilians were killed. Japanese losses were negligible\u201429 planes shot down (several American planes were also shot down by anti-aircraft fire). Commander [[Minoru Genda]], the chief planner of the raid, begged Nagumo to strike again at the shore facilities, oil storage tanks, and submarines, and to hunt down the American carriers that were supposedly nearby. But Nagumo decided not to risk further action. To reach Pearl Harbor, they had to learn how to refuel at sea (a technique the US Navy already had worked out); to sink all those ships they used their electric torpedoes and shallow-water bombing tactics. Despite later rumors, there was no advance knowledge of the Japanese plan. The commanders had been complacent about routine defensive measures. In broader perspective, the attack was a failure. The lost battleships reflected obsolete doctrine and were not needed; the lost planes were soon replaced; the casualty list was short by [[World War II]] standards. Tokyo's calculation that the Americans would lose heart and seek a compromise peace proved wildly wrong\u2014the \"sneak attack\" electrified public opinion, committing America with near unanimity to a war to the death against the Japanese Empire.<ref>Gordon W.

The Japanese army invaded and trapped the American and Filipino forces on the Bataan peninsula. Roosevelt evacuated General [[Douglas MacArthur]] and the nurses, but there was no way to save the trapped men against overwhelming Japanese naval power. MacArthur flew to Australia, vowing \"I came out of Bataan and I shall return.\"  [[Jonathan Mayhew Wainwright IV|Major General Jonathan M. Wainwright]] surrendered on 8 May; the prisoners died by the thousands in the [[Bataan Death March]] and in disease-ridden Japanese prison camps where food and medicine were in very short supply.<ref>Donald J. Young, ''The Battle of Bataan: A Complete History'' (2009)</ref>\n\nThe Japanese Navy seemed unstoppable as they seized the [[Dutch East Indies]] to gain its rich oil resources. The American, British, Dutch, and Australian forces were combined under the [[American-British-Dutch-Australian Command|ABDA]] command but its fleet was quickly sunk in [[Dutch East Indies campaign|several naval battles around Java]].\n\n===Solomon Islands and New Guinea Campaign===\n{{Main|Solomon Islands campaign}}\n\nFollowing their rapid advance, the Japanese started the Solomon Islands Campaign from their newly conquered main base at [[Rabaul]] in January 1942. The Japanese seized several islands including Tulagi and Guadalcanal, before they were halted by further events leading to the [[Guadalcanal Campaign]]. This campaign also converged with the [[New Guinea campaign]].\n\n===Battle of the Coral Sea===\n{{Main|Battle of the Coral Sea}}\n{{See also|Battle of the Coral Sea order of battle}}\n\nIn May 1942, the United States fleet engaged the Japanese fleet during the first battle in history in which neither fleet fired directly on the other, nor did the ships of both fleets actually see each other. It was also the first time that aircraft carriers were used in battle. While indecisive, it was nevertheless a starting point because American commanders learned the tactics that would serve them later in the war. These tactics proved immediately helpful at the battle of Midway only one month later. An excerpt from the Naval War College Review says that \"although the Coral Sea fight was a marginal tactical victory for the IJN [Imperial Japanese Navy], in terms of ships and tonnage sunk, it amounted to a small strategic triumph for the U.S. Navy.\" <ref>{{cite journal |last1=Hodge |first1=Carl Cavanagh |title=The Key to Midway: Coral Sea and a Culture of Learning|journal=Naval War College Review |date=2015 |volume=68 |issue=1 |page=121 |jstor=26397819 |publisher=U.S. Naval War College Press }}</ref>\n\n===Battle of the Aleutian Islands===\n{{Main|Aleutian Islands Campaign}}\nThe Battle of the Aleutian Islands was the last battle between sovereign nations to be fought on America soil. As part of a diversionary plan for the Battle of Midway, the Japanese took control of two of the Aleutian Islands ([[Attu Island|Attu]] and [[Kiska]] Island). Their hope was that strong American naval forces would be drawn away from Midway, enabling a Japanese victory. Because their [[ciphers]] were broken, the American forces only drove the Japanese out after Midway. On 11 May 1943, American and Canadian forces, spearheaded by the [[7th Infantry Division (United States)|U.S. 7th Infantry Division]] landed on Attu, beginning the operation to take back the islands, by the end of May 1943 and after a series of battles, Allied forces retook Attu. On 15 August 1943, Allied forces landed on Kiska to retake it, only to find the Island abandoned by the Japanese.\n\n===Battle of Midway===\n{{Main|Battle of Midway}}\n{{See also|Midway order of battle}}\n[[File:Japanese aircraft carrier Hiryu burning on 5 June 1942 (NH 73064).jpg|thumb|250px|The Japanese carrier [[Japanese aircraft carrier Hiry\u016b|''Hiryu'']] burning after being attacked during the [[battle of Midway]]]]\n\nHaving learned important lessons at Coral Sea, the United States Navy was prepared when the Japanese navy under [[Isoroku Yamamoto|Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto]] launched an offensive aimed at destroying the American Pacific Fleet at Midway Island. The Japanese hoped to embarrass the Americans after the humiliation of the [[Doolittle Raid]] on Tokyo. Midway was a strategic island that both sides wished to use as an air base. Yamamoto hoped to achieve complete surprise and a quick capture of the island, followed by a decisive carrier battle with which he could completely destroy the American carrier fleet. Before the battle began, however, American intelligence intercepted his plan, allowing [[Chester Nimitz|Admiral Chester Nimitz]] to formulate an effective defensive ambush of the Japanese fleet.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/19990508131513/http://www.history.navy.mil/photos/events/wwii-pac/midway/midway.htm \"Battle of Midway, June 4-7, 1942\"] history.navy.mil</ref>  The battle began on 4 June 1942. By the time it was over, the Japanese had lost four carriers, as opposed to one American carrier lost. The Battle of Midway was the turning point of the war in the Pacific because the United States had seized the initiative and was on the offensive for the remaining duration of the war.\n\n===Island hopping===\nFollowing the resounding victory at Midway, the United States began a major land offensive. The Allies came up with a strategy known as [[Leapfrogging (strategy)|Island hopping]], or the bypassing of islands that either served little or no strategic importance<ref>[http://www.u-s-history.com/pages/h1671.html \"Pacific Theater, World War II \u2014 Island Hopping, 1942\u20131945\"], USHistory.com.</ref> or were heavily defended but could be bypassed, such as [[Rabaul#World War II|Rabaul]]. Because air power was crucial to any operation, only islands that could support airstrips were targeted by the Allies. The fighting for each island in the Pacific Theater would be savage, as the Americans faced a determined and battle-hardened enemy who had known little defeat on the ground.\n\n====Air strategy====\n[[File:Lockheed P-38J Lightning - 1.jpg|thumb|300px|P-38 Lightning]]\nGeneral [[George Kenney]], in charge of tactical air power under MacArthur, never had enough planes, pilots or supplies.<ref>George Kenney, ''General Kenney reports: a personal history of the Pacific War'' (Office of Air Force History \u2013 1949) [https://books.google.com/books?id=tWdbngbCc84C&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:Kenney+intitle:Reports+inauthor:kenney&hl=en&ei=ias7TsLSDqrSiAK0-pH3Cw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CCoQ6AEwAA full text online]</ref>   (He was not allowed any authority whatsoever over the Navy's carriers.) But the Japanese were always in worse shape\u2014their equipment  deteriorated rapidly because of poor airfields and incompetent maintenance. The Japanese had excellent planes and pilots in 1942, but ground commanders dictated their missions and ignored the need for air superiority before any other mission could be attempted. Theoretically, Japanese doctrine stressed the need to gain air superiority, but the infantry commanders repeatedly wasted air assets defending minor positions. When Arnold, echoing the official Army line, stated the Pacific was a \"defensive\" theater, Kenney retorted that the Japanese pilot was always on the offensive.  \"He attacks all the time and persists in acting that way. To defend against him you not only have to attack him but to beat him to the punch.\"<ref>Quoted in [[William M. Leary]], ''We Shall Return!: MacArthur's Commanders and the Defeat of Japan'' (2004) p. 99</ref>\n\nA key to Kenney's strategy was the neutralization of bypassed Japanese strongpoints like Rabaul and Truk through repeated bombings. He said a major shortfall was \"the kids coming here from the States were green as grass. They were not getting enough gunnery, acrobatics, formation flying, or night flying.\"<ref>Kenney p 112</ref>  So he set up extensive retraining programs. The arrival of  superior fighters, especially the twin-tailed [[Lockheed P-38 Lightning]], gave the Americans an edge in range and performance. Occasionally a ripe target appeared, as in the [[Battle of the Bismarck Sea]] (March 1943) when bombers sank a major convoy bringing troops and supplies to New Guinea. That success was no fluke. High-flying bombers almost never could hit moving ships. Kenney solved that weakness by teaching pilots the effective new tactic of flying in close to the water then pulling up and lobbing bombs that skipped across the water and into the target.<ref>Martin W. Bowman, ''B-17 Flying Fortress Units of the Pacific War'' (2003) p. 59</ref>\n\n=====Building airfields=====\nThe goal of island hopping was to build forward air fields. AAF commander General Hap Arnold correctly anticipated that he would have to build forward airfields in inhospitable places. Working closely with the Army Corps of Engineers, he created Aviation Engineer Battalions that by 1945 included 118,000 men; it operated in all theaters. Runways, hangars, radar stations, power generators, barracks, gasoline storage tanks and ordnance dumps had to be built hurriedly on tiny coral islands, mud flats, featureless deserts, dense jungles, or exposed locations still under enemy artillery fire. The heavy construction gear had to be imported, along with the engineers, blueprints, steel-mesh landing mats, prefabricated hangars, aviation fuel, bombs and ammunition, and all necessary supplies. As soon as one project was finished the battalion would load up its gear and move forward to the next challenge, while headquarters inked in a new airfield on the maps. Heavy rains often reduced the capacity of old airfields, so new ones were built. Often engineers had to repair and use a captured enemy airfield. Unlike the well-built German air fields in Europe, the Japanese installations were ramshackle affairs with poor siting, poor drainage, scant protection, and narrow, bumpy runways. Engineering was a low priority for the offense-minded Japanese, who chronically lacked adequate equipment and imagination.<ref>Wesley Frank Craven and James Lea Cate, ''The Army Air Forces In World War  II: Vol 7: Services Around The World'' (1958) ch 10</ref>\n\n====Combat experience====\nAirmen flew far more often in the Southwest Pacific than in Europe, and although rest time in Australia was scheduled, there was no fixed number of missions that would produce transfer out of combat, as was the case in Europe. Coupled with the monotonous, hot, sickly environment, the result was bad morale that jaded veterans quickly passed along to newcomers. After a few months, epidemics of combat fatigue (now called [[Combat stress reaction]]) would drastically reduce the efficiency of units. The men who had been at jungle airfields longest, the flight surgeons reported, were in a bad shape:\n::Many have chronic dysentery or other disease, and almost all show chronic fatigue states. . . .They appear listless, unkempt, careless, and apathetic with almost masklike facial expression. Speech is slow, thought content is poor, they complain of chronic headaches, insomnia, memory defect, feel forgotten, worry about themselves, are afraid of new assignments, have no sense of responsibility, and are hopeless about the future.\"<ref>Mae Mills Link and Hubert A. Coleman, ''Medical support of the Army Air Forces in World War II'' (1955) p 851</ref>\n{{check quotation}}\n====Marine Aviation and the issue of ground support====\n[[File:Vought F4U-1 Corsairs of VF-17 in flight, 1943.jpg|left|thumb|Chance-Vought F4U Corsair, 1943]]\nThe Marines had their own land-based aviation, built around the excellent [[Vought F4U Corsair|Chance-Vought F4U Corsair]], an unusually large fighter-bomber. By 1944 10,000 Marine pilots operated 126 combat squadrons. Marine Aviation originally had the mission of close support for ground troops, but it dropped that role in the 1920s and 1930s and became a junior component of naval aviation. The new mission was to protect the fleet from enemy air attacks. Marine pilots, like all aviators, fiercely believed in the prime importance of air superiority; they did not wish to be tied down to supporting ground troops. On the other hand, the ground Marines needed close air support because they lacked heavy firepower of their own. Mobility was a basic mission of Marine ground forces; they were too lightly armed to employ the sort of heavy artillery barrages and massed tank movements the Army used to clear the battlefield. The Japanese were so well dug in that Marines often needed air strikes on positions 300 to 1,500 yards  ahead. In 1944, after considerable internal acrimony, Marine Aviation was forced to start helping out. At Iwo Jima ex-pilots in the air liaison party (ALP) not only requested air support, but actually directed it in tactical detail. The Marine formula increased responsiveness, reduced \"friendly\" casualties, and (flying weather permitting) substituted well for the missing armor and artillery. For the next half century close air support would remain central to the mission of Marine Aviation, provoking eternal jealousy from the Army which was never allowed to operate fixed-wing fighters or bombers, although the Army was allowed to have \nsome unarmed transports and spotter planes.<ref>Robert Lee Sherrod, ''History of Marine Corps Aviation in World War II'' (1952)</ref>\n\n====Guadalcanal====\n{{Main|Guadalcanal Campaign}}\n{{See also|Battle of Guadalcanal order of battle}}\n[[File:GuadLandingsLunga.jpg|thumb|U.S. Marines debark from [[LCPL|LCP(L)s]] onto Guadalcanal on August 7, 1942.]]\nGuadalcanal, fought from August 1942 to February 1943,  was the first major Allied offensive of the war in the Pacific Theater. This campaign pitted American air, naval and ground forces (later augmented by Australians and New Zealanders) against determined Japanese resistance. Guadalcanal was the key to control the [[Solomon Islands]], which both sides saw as strategically essential. Both sides won some battles but both sides were overextended in terms of supply lines. Logistical failures in a hostile physical environment hampered everyone. As happened time and again in the Pacific, the Japanese logistical support system failed, as only 20% of the supplies dispatched from Rabaul to Guadalcanal ever reached there. Consequently, the 30,000 Japanese troops lacked heavy equipment, adequate ammunition and even enough food; 10,000 were killed, 10,000 starved to death, and the remaining 10,000 were evacuated in February 1943. In the end Guadalcanal was a major American victory as the Japanese inability to keep pace with the rate of American reinforcements proved decisive. Guadalcanal is an iconic episode in the annals of American military history, underscoring heroic bravery of underequipped individuals in fierce combat with a determined foe.<ref>Charles W.

In the [[Battle of Edson's Ridge|Battle of Bloody Ridge]], the Americans held off wave after wave of Japanese counterattacks before charging what was left of the Japanese. After more than six months of combat the island was firmly in control of the Allies on 8 February 1943.\n[[File:Casta-MAP Guadalcanal-battles3.jpg|thumb|Guadalcanal showing several Naval battles.]]\n\nMeanwhile, the rival navies fought seven battles, with the two sides diving the victories.<ref>Samuel Eliot Morison, ''History of United States Naval Operations in World War II. Vol. 5: The Struggle for Guadalcanal, August 1942 \u2013 February 1943'' (1949)</ref> Following the Japanese victory at the [[Battle of Savo Island]] on 8\u20139 August, Admiral Fletcher withdrew his ships from around Guadalcanal. A second Japanese naval force sailed south and engaged the American fleet in the [[Battle of the Eastern Solomons]] on 24\u201325 August, ending in a draw but forced the Japanese naval force to retreat. On 11\u201312 October 1942,  to disrupt Japanese attempts to reinforce and resupply their troops on Guadalcanal (nicknamed the \"Tokyo Express\"), a small US naval force attacked this supply lines at the [[Battle of Cape Esperance]] and succeeded. In support of the Japanese ground offensive in October, Japanese naval forces engaged and hoped to decisively defeat any US naval forces in the area of operation at the [[Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands]] on 25\u201327 October 1942, however the Japanese failed to decisively defeat US Navy. From 12\u201315 November 1942, the [[Naval Battle of Guadalcanal]] took place: Learning that the Japanese were trying to reinforce their troops for an attack on Henderson field, U.S. forces launched aircraft and warship to prevent the Japanese ground troops from reaching Guadalcanal, the U.S. succeeded thus turning back Japan's last major attempt to dislodge Allied forces from Guadalcanal. A small US naval force attempted to surprise and destroy the Japanese Navy were attempting to deliver supplies to their forces on Guadalcanal at [[Battle of Tassafaronga]] however it wasn't successful. The final naval battle took place between 29\u201330 January 1943, known as the [[Battle of Rennell Island]], US naval forces attempted to stop the Japanese Navy evacuating its ground forces from Guadalcanal, however the Japanese successfully forced the US Navy to withdraw, protecting the Japanese evacuation.<ref>Richard Overy, ''War in the Pacific'' (2010)</ref>\n\n====Tarawa====\n{{Main|Battle of Tarawa}}\n\nGuadalcanal made it clear to the Americans that the Japanese would fight to the bitter end. After brutal fighting in which few prisoners were taken on either side, the United States and the Allies pressed on the offensive. The landings at Tarawa on 20 November 1943, by the Americans became bogged down as armor attempting to break through the Japanese lines of defense either sank, were disabled or took on too much water to be of use. The Americans were eventually able to land a limited number of tanks and drive inland. After days of fighting they took control of Tarawa on 23 November. Of the original 2,600 Japanese soldiers on the island, only 17 were still alive.\n\n====Operations in Central Pacific====\n[[File:Halsey.JPG|thumb|215px|Admiral [[William F. Halsey]] \u2013 Commander U.S. Third Fleet at Leyte Gulf]]\n\nIn preparation of the recapture of the Philippines, the Allies started the [[Gilbert and Marshall Islands campaign]] to retake the Gilbert and Marshall Islands from the Japanese in summer 1943. Moving closer to Japan, the U.S. Navy decisively won the [[Battle of the Philippine Sea]] and landing forces captured the [[Mariana and Palau Islands campaign|Mariana and Palau Islands]] in summer 1944. The goal was building airbases within range of the new B-29 bomber aimed at Japan's industrial cities.\n\n====Liberation of the Philippines====\n{{Main|Battle of Leyte Gulf|Philippines Campaign (1944\u201345)}}\n\nThe [[Battle of Leyte Gulf]] in  23\u201326 October 1944, was a decisive American victory that sank virtually the entire remaining Japanese fleet in arguably the [[largest naval battle in history]]. Although the Japanese came surprisingly close to inflicting a major defeat on the Americans, at the last minute the Japanese panicked and lost. The battle was a complex overlapping series of engagements fought off the Philippine island of Leyte, which the U.S. Army had just invaded. The army forces were highly vulnerable to naval attack, and the Japanese goal was to inflict massive destruction. Two American fleets were involved, the Seventh and Third, but they were independent and did not communicate well so the Japanese with a trick maneuver slipped between the two American fleets and almost reached the beaches. However the Japanese communication system was even worse, and the Japanese army and navy did not cooperate, and the three Japanese fleets were each destroyed.<ref>C. Vann Woodward, ''The Battle for Leyte Gulf'' (1947)</ref>\n\nGeneral MacArthur fulfilled his promise to return to the Philippines by landing at Leyte on 20 October 1944. The grueling re-capture of the Philippines took place from 1944 to 1945 and included the battles of [[Battle of Leyte|Leyte]], [[Battle of Luzon|Luzon]], and [[Battle of Mindanao|Mindanao]].\n\n====Iwo Jima====\n[[File:Ronson flame tank Iwo Jima.jpg|thumb|300px|An [[M4 Sherman|M4 Sherman tank]] equipped with a flamethrower clearing a Japanese bunker on Iwo Jima, March 1945.]]\n\n{{Main|Battle of Iwo Jima}}\nThe Americans did not bypass the small island of Iwo Jima because it wanted bases for fighter escorts; it was actually used as an emergency landing base for B-29s. The Japanese knew they could not win, but they devised a strategy to maximize American casualties. Learning from the [[Battle of Saipan]] they prepared many fortified positions on the island, including [[Bunker|pillboxes]] and tunnels. The Marines attack began on 19 February 1945. Initially the Japanese put up no resistance, letting the Americans mass, creating more targets before the Americans took intense fire from [[Mount Suribachi]] and fought throughout the night until the hill was surrounded. Over the next 36 days, the Japanese were pressed into an ever-shrinking pocket, but they chose to fight on to the end, leaving only 1,000 of the original 21,000 defenders alive. The Marines suffered as well, suffering 25,000 casualties. The battle became iconic in America as the epitome of heroism in desperate hand-to-hand combat.<ref>Joseph H. Alexander, ''Closing In: Marines in the Seizure of Iwo Jima'' (1994), short Marine Corps history [http://ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USMC/USMC-C-Iwo/index.html online edition]</ref>\n\n====Okinawa====\n{{Main|Battle of Okinawa}}\n[[Okinawa]] became the last major battle of the Pacific Theater and the Second World War. The island was to become a staging area for the eventual [[Operation Downfall|invasion of Japan]] since it was just 350 miles (550&nbsp;km) south of the [[Mainland Japan|Japanese mainland]]. Marines and soldiers landed unopposed on 1 April 1945, to begin an 82-day campaign which became the largest land-sea-air battle in history and was noted for the ferocity of the fighting and the high civilian casualties with over 150,000 Okinawans losing their lives. Japanese [[kamikaze]] pilots caused the largest loss of ships in U.S. naval history with the sinking of 38 and the damaging of another 368. Total U.S. casualties were over 12,500 dead and 38,000 wounded, while the Japanese lost over 110,000 soldiers and 150,000 civilians. The fierce combat and high American losses led the Army and the Navy to oppose an invasion of the main islands. An alternative strategy was chosen: using the [[atomic bomb]] to induce surrender.<ref>William L. O'Neill, ''The Oxford Essential Guide to World War II'' (2002) p 279</ref>\n\n====Strategic Bombing of Japan====\n[[File:39th Bombardment Group B-29 Superfortress.jpg|thumb|B-29 Superfortress dropping 500 pound high-explosive bombs over Japan, 1945.]]\n{{main|Air raids on Japan}}\nThe flammability of Japan's large cities, and the concentration of munitions production there, made strategic bombing the favorite strategy of the Americans from 1941 onward. The first efforts were made from bases in China, where massive efforts to establish B-29 bases there and supply them over the Hump (the Himalayas) failed in 1944; the Japanese Army simply moved overland and captured the bases. [[Saipan]] and [[Tinian]], captured by the U.S. in June 1944, gave secure bases for the very-long-range B-29. The [[Boeing B-29 Superfortress]] boasted four 2,200 horsepower Wright R-3350 supercharged engines that could lift four tons of bombs 33,000 feet (high above Japanese flak or fighters), and make 3,500 mile round trips. However, the systematic raids that began in June 1944, were unsatisfactory, because the AAF had learned too much in Europe; it overemphasized self-defense. Arnold, in personal charge of the campaign (bypassing the theater commanders) brought in a new leader, brilliant, indefatigable, hard-charging General [[Curtis LeMay]]. In early 1945, LeMay ordered a radical change in tactics: remove the machine guns and gunners, fly in low at night. (Much fuel was used to get to 30,000 feet; it could now be replaced with more bombs.) The Japanese radar, fighter, and anti-aircraft systems were so ineffective that they could not hit the bombers. Fires raged through the cities, and millions of civilians fled to the mountains.<ref>John Olsen, ''A History of Air Warfare'' (2009) p 74</ref>\n\nTokyo was hit repeatedly, and during [[Operation Meetinghouse|the first massive fire raid of March 9\u201310, 1945]] suffered a conflagration of about 16 square miles (41&nbsp;km\u00b2) in area, that killed at least 83,000. On 5 June, 51,000 buildings in four miles of Kobe were burned out by 473 B-29s; the Japanese were learning to fight back, as 11 B-29s went down and 176 were damaged.<ref>Donald L. Miller, ''D-days in the Pacific'' (2005) p. 2222</ref> Osaka, where one-sixth of the Empire's munitions were made, was hit by 1,733 tons of incendiaries dropped by 247 B-29s. A firestorm burned out 8.1 square miles, including 135,000 houses; 4,000 died.<ref>William W.

Moreover, owing to the rising fear of air attacks, workers in general were reluctant to work in the factories, and the attendance fluctuated as much as 50 percent.\n\nThe Japanese army, which was not based in the cities, was largely undamaged by the raids. The Army was short of food and gasoline, but, as Iwo Jima and Okinawa proved, it was capable of ferocious resistance. The Japanese also had a new tactic that it hoped would provide the bargaining power to get a satisfactory peace, the Kamikaze.\n\n====Kamikaze====\nIn late 1944 the Japanese invented an unexpected and highly effective new tactic, the [[Kamikaze]] suicide plane aimed like a guided missile at American ships. The attacks began in October 1944 and continued to the end of the war. Experienced pilots were used to lead a mission because they could navigate; they were not Kamikazes, and they returned to base for another mission. The Kamikaze pilots were inexperienced and had minimal training; however most were well educated and intensely committed to the Emperor.<ref>Syohgo Hattori, \"Kamikaze: Japan's Glorious Failure.\" ''Air Power History'' 1996 43(1): 14\u201327. {{ISSN|1044-016X}}</ref><ref>Rikihei Inoguchi and Tadashi Nakajima, ''The Divine Wind: Japan's Kamikaze Force in World War II'' (1994)</ref>\n[[File:D4Y Yoshinori Yamaguchi col.jpg|thumb|A \"Judy\" in a suicide dive against {{USS|Essex|CV-9|6}}.

Rielly, ''Kamikazes, Corsairs, and Picket Ships: Okinawa, 1945'' (2010)</ref> Task Force 58 analyzed the Japanese technique at Okinawa in April 1945:\n:\"Rarely have the enemy attacks been so cleverly executed and made with such reckless determination. These attacks were generally by single or few aircraft making their approaches with radical changes in course and altitude, dispersing when intercepted and using cloud cover to every advantage. They tailed our friendlies home, used decoy planes, and came in at any altitude or on the water.\"<ref>quoted in Norman Friedman, ''U.S. naval weapons: every gun, missile, mine, and torpedo used by the U.S. Navy from 1883 to the present day'' (1982) p 93</ref>\n\nThe Americans decided the best defense against Kamikazes was to knock them out on the ground, or else in the air long before they approached the fleet. The Navy called for more fighters, and more warning, which meant combat air patrols circling the big ships, more radar picket ships (which themselves became prime targets), and more attacks on airbases and gasoline supplies. Japan suspended Kamikaze attacks in May 1945, because it was now hoarding gasoline and hiding planes in preparation for new suicide attacks if the Allies dared to invade their home islands. The Kamikaze strategy allowed the use of untrained pilots and obsolete planes, and since evasive maneuvering was dropped and there was no return trip, the scarce gasoline reserves could be stretched further. Since pilots guided their airplane like a guided missile all the way to the target, the proportion of hits was much higher than in ordinary bombing. Japan's industry was manufacturing 1,500 new planes a month in 1945. However, the quality of construction was very poor, and many new planes crashed during training or before reaching targets.\n\nExpecting increased resistance, including far more Kamikaze attacks once the main islands of Japan were invaded, the U.S. high command rethought its strategy and used atomic bombs to end the war, hoping it would make a costly invasion unnecessary.<ref>John Ray Skates, ''The invasion of Japan: alternative to the bomb'' (2000) p. 241</ref>\n\n====U.S. submarines in the Pacific====\n{{main|Allied submarines in the Pacific War}}\n[[File:Japanese Patrol Boat No.39 sinking after being torpedoed on 23 April 1943.jpg|thumb|A Japanese escort vessel sinking after being torpedoed by the {{USS|Seawolf|SS-197|6}}, 23 April 1943.]]\n\nU.S. submarines participated in the majority of naval battles in the Pacific theater, but the submarines were most decisive in their blockade of Japan, for which Japan was dependent on its sea transport to provide resources for its war effort.\n\nOn the afternoon of 7 December 1941, six hours after the Japanese attack, U.S. naval commanders in the Pacific were ordered by the U.S. Navy Chief of Staff to \"execute unrestricted air and submarine warfare against Japan\".<ref>Spector (1984), pp.478\u2013479; Blair, ''Silent Victory'', p.106; Holwitt, Joel I.

This included reconnaissance U.S. submarines landed and supplied guerillas in Japanese occupied territory and carrying in commandos for missions such as the [[Makin Island raid]], they also rescued crews of aircraft which had been forced down over the ocean.\n\nAs a result of several key improvements in strategy and tactics, from 1943, Allied submarines waged a more effective campaign against Japanese merchant shipping and the IJN, in effect strangling the Japanese Empire of resources. By the end of the war in August 1945, U.S. Navy submarines sank around 1300 Japanese merchant ships, as well as roughly 200 warships.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.2worldwar2.com/submarines.htm|title=World War 2 Submarines|publisher=}}</ref> Only 42 U.S. submarines were sunk in the Pacific,<ref name=pigboats>Roscoe, Theodore.

A fear in the American high command was that an invasion of mainland Japan would lead to enormous losses on the part of the Allies, as casualty estimates for the planned Operation Downfall demonstrate. As Japan was able to withstand the devastating incendiary raids and the naval blockade despite hundreds of thousands of civilian deaths, President Harry Truman gave the order to [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|drop the only two available atomic bombs]], hoping that such sheer force of destruction on a city would break Japanese resolve and end the war. The first bomb was dropped on an industrial city, [[Hiroshima]], on 6 August 1945, killing approximately 70,000 people. A second bomb was dropped on another industrial city, [[Nagasaki]], on 9 August after it appeared that the Japanese high command was not planning to surrender, killing approximately 35,000 people. Fearing additional atomic attacks, [[Surrender of Japan|Japan surrendered]] on 15 August 1945.\n\n[[Victory over Japan Day|V-J Day]] which occurred on 15 August 1945 marked the end of the United States' war with the Empire of Japan. Since Japan was the last remaining Axis Power, V-J Day also marked the end of World War II.\n\n==Minor American front==\n{{Main|China Burma India Theater}}\n\nThe United States contributed several forces to the China Burma India theater, such as the 5307th Composite Unit (Provisional) but nicknamed \"[[Merrill's Marauders]]\" after its commander; [[Frank Merrill]], it  was a United States Army [[long range penetration]] [[special operations]] [[jungle warfare]] unit organized as light infantry assault units. In slightly more than five months of combat in 1944, the Marauders advanced 750 miles through some of the harshest jungle terrain in the world, fought in five major engagements, mostly behind enemy lines, with or in support of British Empire and Chinese forces in [[Burma Campaign|Burma]] and suffered many casualties. On 10 August 1944 the Marauders were consolidated into the 475th Infantry. The U.S. also had an adviser to [[Chiang Kai-shek]] and [[Joseph Stillwell]]. Units of the [[Tenth Air Force]], [[Fourteenth Air Force]], and [[Twentieth Air Force]] of the USAAF also served in the theatre, including the previously mentioned \"Flying Tigers\".\n\n==Attacks on U.S. soil==\n{{main|American Theater (World War II)}}\nAlthough the [[Axis powers]] never launched a full-scale [[invasion of the United States]], there were attacks and acts of sabotage on U.S. soil.\n* January\u2013August 1942 \u2013 [[Second Happy Time]], German U-Boats engaged American ships off the U.S. East Coast.\n* February 23, 1942 \u2013 [[Bombardment of Ellwood]], a Japanese submarine attack on California.\n* March 4, 1942 \u2013 [[Operation K]], a Japanese reconnaissance over Pearl Harbor following the attack on December 7, 1941. \n* June 3, 1942 \u2013 August 15, 1943 \u2013 [[Aleutian Islands Campaign]], the battle for the then incorporated territory of Alaska.\n* June 21\u201322, 1942 \u2013 [[Bombardment of Fort Stevens]], the second attack on a U.S. military base in the continental U.S. in World War II.\n* September 9, 1942, and September 29, 1942 \u2013 [[Lookout Air Raids]], the only attack by enemy aircraft on the U.S. mainland and the second enemy aircraft attack on the U.S. continent in World War II.\n* November 1944\u2013April 1945 \u2013 [[Fu-Go balloon bomb]]s, over 9,300 of them were launched by Japan across the Pacific Ocean towards the U.S. mainland to start forest fires.

During the first two years of [[World War II]], the [[United States]] had maintained formal [[Non-interventionism|neutrality]] as made official in the [[Quarantine Speech]] delivered by [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] in 1937, while supplying [[United Kingdom|Britain]], the [[Soviet Union]], and [[Republic of China (1912\u201349)|China]] with war material through the [[Lend-Lease|Lend-Lease Act]] which was signed into law on 11 March 1941, as well as [[Occupation of Iceland#United States occupation|deploying the U.S. military]] to replace the [[Invasion of Iceland|British invasion forces in Iceland]]. Following the \"Greer incident\" Roosevelt publicly confirmed the \"shoot on sight\" order on 11 September 1941, effectively declaring naval war on Germany and Italy in the [[Battle of the Atlantic]].<ref>Burns, James MacGregor (1970). Roosevelt: The Soldier of Freedom. Harcourt Brace Jovanovich. hdl:2027/heb.00626. {{ISBN|978-0-15-678870-0}}. pp. 141-42</ref> In the [[Pacific War|Pacific Theater]], there was unofficial early U.S. combat activity such as the [[Flying Tigers]].\n\nDuring the war some 16 million Americans served in the [[United States Armed Forces]], with 405,399 killed and 671,278 [[wounded in action|wounded]].<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.world-war-2.info/casualties/ | title=World War 2 Casualties|work=World War 2|publisher = Otherground, LLC and World-War-2.info | year=2003 |accessdate=20 June 2006}}</ref> There were also 130,201 American [[Prisoner of war|prisoners of war]], of whom 116,129 returned home after the war.<ref>{{cite news |title=World War II POWs remember efforts to strike against captors |agency=Associated Press |url=http://www.nola.com/news/index.ssf/2012/10/world_war_ii_pows_remember_the.html |newspaper=The Times-Picayune |date=5 October 2012 |accessdate=23 June 2013}}</ref> Key civilian advisors to President Roosevelt included [[Secretary of War]] [[Henry L. Stimson]], who mobilized the nation's industries and induction centers to supply the [[United States Army|Army]], commanded by [[General (United States)|General]] [[George Marshall]] and the [[Army Air Forces]] under General [[Hap Arnold]]. The [[United States Navy|Navy]], led by [[Secretary of the Navy]] [[Frank Knox]] and [[Admiral (United States)|Admiral]] [[Ernest King]], proved more autonomous. Overall priorities were set by Roosevelt and the [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]], chaired by [[William D. Leahy|William Leahy]]. Highest priority went to the defeat of Germany in Europe, but first the war against Japan in the Pacific was more urgent after the sinking of the main battleship fleet at [[Pearl Harbor]].\n\nAdmiral King put Admiral [[Chester W. Nimitz]], based in Hawaii, in charge of the Pacific War against Japan. The [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] had the advantage, taking the [[Philippines Campaign (1941\u201342)|Philippines]] as well as British and Dutch possessions, and threatening Australia but in June 1942, its main carriers were sunk during the [[Battle of Midway]], and the Americans seized the initiative. The Pacific War became one of [[island hopping]], so as to move [[Military airbase|air bases]] closer and closer to Japan. The Army, based in Australia under General [[Douglas MacArthur]], steadily advanced across [[New Guinea campaign|New Guinea]] to the [[Philippines Campaign (1944\u201345)|Philippines]], with plans to invade the Japanese home islands in late 1945. With its merchant fleet sunk by American submarines, Japan ran short of aviation gasoline and fuel oil, as the U.S. Navy in June 1944 captured islands within [[Air raids on Japan|bombing range of the Japanese home islands]]. [[Strategic bombing]] directed by General [[Curtis Lemay]] destroyed all the major Japanese cities, as the U.S. [[Battle of Okinawa|captured Okinawa]] after heavy losses in spring 1945. With the [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]], the [[Soviet invasion of Manchuria]], and [[Operation Downfall|an invasion of the home islands]] imminent, [[Surrender of Japan|Japan surrendered]].\n\nThe war in Europe involved aid to Britain, her allies, and the Soviet Union, with the U.S. supplying munitions until it could ready an invasion force. U.S. forces were first tested to a limited degree in the [[Tunisia Campaign|North African Campaign]] and then employed more significantly with [[British Armed Forces|British Forces]] in [[Italian Campaign (World War II)|Italy in 1943\u201345]], where U.S. forces, representing about a third of the [[Allies of World War II|Allied forces]] deployed, bogged down after [[Armistice of Cassibile|Italy surrendered]] and the Germans took over. Finally the main [[Operation Overlord|invasion of France]] took place in June 1944, under General [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]]. Meanwhile, the [[United States Army Air Forces|U.S. Army Air Forces]] and the [[Royal Air Force|British Royal Air Force]] engaged in the area bombardment of German cities and systematically targeted German transportation links and synthetic oil plants, as it knocked out what was left of the [[Luftwaffe]] post [[Battle of Britain]] in 1944. Being invaded from all sides, it became clear that Germany would lose the war.

World War II cost the United States an estimated $341 billion in 1945 dollars \u2013 equivalent to 74% of America's [[GDP]] and expenditures during the war.

The United States returned to its typical [[Isolationism|isolationist]] foreign policy after the [[World War I|First World War]] and President [[Woodrow Wilson]]'s failure to have the [[Treaty of Versailles]] ratified. Although President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] personally favored a more assertive foreign policy, his administration remained committed to isolationism during the 1930's in order to ensure [[New Deal coalition|congressional support]] for the [[New Deal]], and allowed Congress to pass the [[Neutrality Acts of the 1930s|Neutrality Acts]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://history.state.gov/milestones/1937-1945/american-isolationism|title=Milestones: 1937\u20131945 - Office of the Historian|website=history.state.gov|access-date=2020-01-24}}</ref> As a result, the United States played no role in the [[Second Italo-Ethiopian War]] and the [[Spanish Civil War]]. After the [[Invasion of Poland|German invasion of Poland]] and the beginning of the war in September 1939, Congress allowed foreign countries to purchase war material from the United States on a \"[[Cash and carry (World War II)|cash-and-carry]]\" basis, but assistance to the United Kingdom was still limited by British hard currency shortages and the [[Johnson Act]], and President Roosevelt's military advisers believed that the Allied Powers would be defeated and that U.S. military assets should be focused on defending the [[Western Hemisphere]]. \n\nBy 1940 the U.S., while still neutral, was becoming the \"[[Arsenal of Democracy]]\" for the Allies, supplying money and war materials. Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]] and President Roosevelt agreed to exchange fifty U.S. [[Destroyer|destroyers]] for 99-year-leases to British military bases in [[Dominion of Newfoundland|Newfoundland]] and the [[Caribbean]].The [[Battle of France|sudden defeat of France]] in spring 1940 caused the nation to begin to expand its armed forces, including the first [[Conscription in the United States|peacetime draft]].

Although under American law, it was illegal for United States citizens to join the armed forces of foreign nations and in doing so, they lost their [[Citizenship of the United States|citizenship]], many American volunteers changed their nationality to [[Canadians|Canadian]]. However Congress passed a blanket pardon in 1944.<ref name=\"Eagle Squadrons\">{{cite web|url=http://www.rafmuseum.org.uk/research/online-exhibitions/americans-in-the-royal-air-force/eagle-squadrons.aspx|title=Eagle Squadrons|accessdate= 19 April 2015}}</ref> American mercenary Colonel Charles Sweeny, living in [[London]], began recruiting American citizens to fight as a U.S. volunteer detachment in the [[French Air Force]], however France fell before this was implemented.<ref name=\"Eagle Squadrons\"/> During the [[Battle of Britain]], 11 American pilots flew in the [[Royal Air Force]]. Charles Sweeney's nephew, also named Charles, formed a [[Home Guard (United Kingdom)|Home Guard]] unit from American volunteers living in London.<ref name=\"Eagle Squadrons\"/>\n\nOne notable example was the [[Eagle Squadrons]], which were [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] squadrons made up of American volunteers and British personnel. The first to be formed was [[No. 71 Squadron RAF|No. 71 Squadron]] on 19 September 1940, followed by  [[No. 121 Squadron RAF|No. 121 Squadron]] on 14 May 1941 and [[No. 133 Squadron RAF|No. 133 Squadron]] on 1 August 1941. 6,700 Americans applied to join but only 244 got to serve with the three Eagle squadrons; 16 Britons also served as squadron and flight commanders. The first became operational in February 1941 and the squadrons scored their first kill in July 1941. On 29 September 1942, the three squadrons were officially turned over by the RAF to the [[Eighth Air Force]] of the [[U.S. Army Air Forces]] and became the [[4th Fighter Group]]. In their time with the RAF the squadrons claim to have shot 73\u00bd German planes; 77 Americans and 5 Britons were killed.<ref>'Aces High', Shores and Williams, 1994, pages 31, 38, 40</ref>\n\nAnother notable example was the [[Flying Tigers]], created by [[Claire Chennault|Claire L. Chennault]], a retired [[U.S. Army Air Corps]] officer working in the [[Republic of China#History|China]] since August 1937, first as [[military aviation]] advisor to [[Generalissimo]] [[Chiang Kai-shek]] in the early months of the [[Sino-Japanese War (1937\u20131945)|Sino-Japanese War]]. Officially known as the 1st American Volunteer Group (AVG) but nicknamed the \"Flying Tigers\", this was a group of American Pilots already serving in the [[United States Armed Forces|US Armed forces]] and recruited under presidential authority. As a unit they would serve in the Chinese Air Force to fight against the [[Armed Forces of the Empire of Japan|Japanese]]. The group comprised three fighter squadrons of around 30 aircraft each. The AVG's first combat mission was on 20 December 1941, twelve days after the Pearl Harbor attack. On 4 July 1942 the AVG was disbanded, and was replaced by the [[23rd Fighter Group]] of the [[United States Army Air Forces]], which was later absorbed into the U.S. [[Fourteenth Air Force]].

Marshall]] in charge of the [[United States Army|Army]], and in nominal control of the Air Force, which in practice was commanded by General [[Hap Arnold]] on Marshall's behalf. King was also in control for wartime being of the [[United States Coast Guard|US Coast Guard]] under its Commandant, Admiral [[Russell R. Waesche]]. Roosevelt formed a new body, the [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]], which made the final decisions on American military strategy and as the chief policy-making body for the armed forces. The Joint Chiefs was a White House agency chaired by Admiral [[William D. Leahy]], who became FDR's chief military advisor and the highest military officer of the US at that time.<ref>Henry H.

The [[Nazi Germany|German]] victories in [[Battle of France|France]], [[Invasion of Poland (1939)|Poland]] and elsewhere, combined with the [[Battle of Britain]], led many Americans to believe that some intervention would be needed. In March 1941, the [[Lend-Lease]] program began shipping money, munitions, and food to Britain, China, and (by that fall) the Soviet Union.\n\nBy 1941 the United States was taking an active part in the war, despite its nominal neutrality. In spring [[U-boat|U-boats]] began their \"wolf-pack\" tactics which threatened to sever the trans- Atlantic supply line; Roosevelt extended the [[Pan-American Security Zone]] east almost as far as [[Iceland]]. The US Navy's \"neutrality patrols\" were not actually neutral as, in practice, their function was to report Axis ship and submarine sightings to the British and Canadian navies, and from April the US Navy began escorting Allied convoys from Canada as far as the \"Mid-Atlantic Meeting Point\" (MOMP) south of Iceland, where they handed off to the RN.\n\nOn 16 June 1941, after negotiation with [[Winston Churchill|Churchill]], Roosevelt ordered the United States occupation of Iceland to replace the [[Invasion of Iceland|British invasion forces]]. On 22 June 1941, the US Navy sent Task Force 19 (TF 19) from [[Charleston, South Carolina]] to assemble at [[Argentia, Newfoundland]]. TF 19 included [[Invasion of Iceland#Task Force 19|25 warships]] and the [[1st Provisional Marine Brigade]] of 194 officers and 3714 men from [[San Diego, California]] under the command of Brigadier General John Marston.<ref name=\"morison\">{{cite book|title=The Battle of the Atlantic September 1939 \u2013 May 1943|author= Morison, Samuel Eliot|publisher=Little, Brown and Company|year=1975|pages=74\u201379}}</ref> Task Force 19 (TF 19) sailed from Argentia on 1 July.

[[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marines]] commenced landing on 8 July, and disembarkation was completed on 12 July. On 6 August, the [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] established an air base at Reykjav\u00edk with the arrival of Patrol Squadron VP-73 [[PBY Catalina]]s and VP-74 [[PBM Mariner]]s. [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] personnel began arriving in Iceland in August, and the Marines had been transferred to the Pacific by March 1942.<ref name=\"morison\"/> Up to 40,000 U.S. military personnel were stationed on the island, outnumbering adult Icelandic men (at the time, Iceland had a population of about 120,000.) The agreement was for the US military to remain until the end of the war (although the US military presence in Iceland [[Naval Air Station Keflavik#Deactivation|remained through 2006]], as postwar Iceland became a member of [[NATO]]).\n\nAmerican warships escorting Allied convoys in the western Atlantic had several hostile encounters with U-boats.  On 4 September, a German U-Boat attacked the destroyer {{USS|Greer|DD-145|6}} off Iceland. A week later Roosevelt ordered American warships to attack U-boats on sight. A U-boat shot up the {{USS|Kearny|DD-432|6}} as it escorted a British merchant convoy. The {{USS|Reuben James|DD-245|6}} was sunk by {{GS|U-552}} on 31 October 1941.<ref>George W.

This was because two of the Allied capitals, London and [[Moscow]], could be directly threatened by Germany, but none of the major Allied capitals were threatened by Japan.\nGermany was the United Kingdom's primary threat, especially after the Fall of France in 1940, which saw Germany overrun most of the countries of [[Western Europe]], leaving the United Kingdom alone to combat Germany. Germany's planned invasion of the UK, Operation Sea Lion, was averted by its failure to establish air superiority in the Battle of Britain. At the same time, war with Japan in East Asia seemed increasingly likely. Although the U.S. was not yet at war with either Germany or Japan, it met with the UK on several occasions to formulate joint strategies.\n\nIn the 29 March 1941 report of the [[U.S.\u2013British Staff Conference (ABC\u20131)|ABC-1 conference]], the Americans and British agreed that their strategic objectives were: (1) \"The early defeat of Germany as the predominant member of the Axis with the principal military effort of the United States being exerted in the Atlantic and European area; and (2) A strategic defensive in the [[Far East]].\"\nThus, the Americans concurred with the British in the grand strategy of \"Europe first\" (or \"Germany first\") in carrying out military operations in World War II. The UK feared that, if the United States was diverted from its main focus in Europe to the Pacific (Japan), Hitler might crush both the Soviet Union and Britain, and would then become an unconquerable fortress in Europe. The wound inflicted on the United States by Japan at Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941, did not result in a change in U.S. policy. Prime Minister Winston Churchill hastened to Washington shortly after Pearl Harbor for the Arcadia Conference to ensure that the Americans didn't have second thoughts about Europe First. The two countries reaffirmed that, \"notwithstanding the entry of Japan into the War, our view remains that Germany is still the prime enemy. And her defeat is the key to victory. Once Germany is defeated the collapse of Italy and the defeat of Japan must follow.\"\n\n===Battle of the Atlantic===\n{{Main|Battle of the Atlantic}}\nThe Battle of the Atlantic was the longest continuous military campaign in World War II, running from 1939 to the defeat of Germany in 1945. At its core was the [[Blockade of Germany (1939\u20131945)|Allied naval blockade of Germany]], announced the day after the declaration of war, and Germany's subsequent counter-blockade. It was at its height from mid-1940 through to the end of 1943. The Battle of the Atlantic pitted U-boats and other warships of the [[Kriegsmarine]] (German navy) and aircraft of the [[Luftwaffe]] (German Air Force) against the Royal Canadian Navy, Royal Navy, the United States Navy, and Allied merchant shipping. The convoys, coming mainly from [[North America]] and predominantly going to the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union, were protected for the most part by the British and Canadian navies and air forces. These forces were aided by ships and aircraft of the United States from 13 September 1941. The Germans were joined by submarines of the [[Regia Marina|Italian Royal Navy]] (Regia Marina) after their Axis ally Italy entered the war on 10 June 1940.\n\n===Operation Torch===\n{{Main|Operation Torch}}\n[[File:American troops on board a landing craft heading for the beaches at Oran in Algeria during Operation 'Torch', November 1942.

General [[Dwight D. Eisenhower|Dwight Eisenhower]] commanded the assault on [[North Africa]], and Major General [[George S. Patton|George Patton]] struck at [[Casablanca]].\n\n===Allied victory in North Africa===\n{{Main|North African Campaign}}\n\nThe United States did not have a smooth entry into the war against [[Nazi Germany]]. Early in 1943, the [[U.S. Army]] suffered a near-disastrous defeat at the [[Battle of the Kasserine Pass]] in February. The senior Allied leadership was primarily to blame for the loss as internal bickering between American General [[Lloyd Fredendall]] and the British led to mistrust and little communication, causing inadequate troop placements.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20071211081444/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3723/is_200303/ai_n9222724 \"Command Failures: Lessons Learned from Lloyd R. Fredendall\"] Steven L. Ossad, findarticles.com</ref>  The defeat could be considered a major turning point, however, because General Eisenhower replaced Fredendall with General Patton.\n\nSlowly the Allies stopped the German advance in [[French protectorate of Tunisia|Tunisia]] and by March were pushing back. In mid April, under British General [[Bernard Law Montgomery, 1st Viscount Montgomery of Alamein|Bernard Montgomery]], the Allies smashed through the [[Mareth Line]] and broke the Axis defense in North Africa. On 13 May 1943, Axis troops in North Africa surrendered, leaving behind 275,000 men. Allied efforts turned towards Sicily and Italy.\n[[File:ItalyDefenseLinesSouthofRome1943 4.jpg|thumb|300px|The situation south of Rome showing German prepared defensive lines]]\n\n===Invasion of Sicily and Italy===\n{{Main|Allied invasion of Sicily|Allied invasion of Italy}}\n\nThe first stepping stone for the Allied liberation of Europe was invading Europe through Italy. Launched on 9 July 1943, Operation Husky was, at the time, the largest [[Amphibious warfare|amphibious]] operation ever undertaken. The American seaborne assault by the [[U.S. 7th Army]]  landed on the southern coast of Sicily between the town of Licata in the west, and Scoglitti in the east and units of the 82nd airborne division parachuted ahead of landings. Despite the elements, the operation was a success and the Allies immediately began exploiting their gains. On 11 August, seeing that the battle was lost, the German and Italian commanders began evacuating their forces from Sicily to Italy. On 17 August, the Allies were in control of the island, U.S. 7th Army lost 8,781 men (2,237 killed or missing, 5,946 wounded, and 598 captured).\n\nFollowing the Allied victory in Sicily, Italian public sentiment swung against the war and Italian dictator [[Benito Mussolini]]. He was dismissed from office by the [[Grand Council of Fascism|Fascist Grand Council]] and [[Victor Emmanuel III of Italy|King Victor Emmanuel III]], and the Allies struck quickly, hoping resistance would be slight. The first Allied troops landed on the Italian peninsula on 3 September 1943 and Italy surrendered on 8 September, however the [[Italian Social Republic]] was established soon afterwards. The first American troops landed at Salerno on 9 September 1943, by [[U.S. 5th Army]], however, German troops in Italy were prepared and after the Allied troops at Salerno had consolidated their beachhead, The Germans launched fierce counterattacks. However, they failed to destroy the beachhead and retreated on 16 September and in October 1943 began preparing a series of defensive lines across central Italy. The US 5th Army and other Allied armies broke through the first two lines ([[Volturno Line|Volturno]] and the [[Barbara Line]]) in October and November 1943. As winter approached, the Allies made slow progress due to the weather and the difficult terrain against the heavily defended German Winter Line; they did however manage to break through the [[Bernhardt Line]] in January 1944. By early 1944 the Allied attention had turned to the western front and the Allies were taking heavy losses trying to break through the Winter Line at [[Battle of Monte Cassino|Monte Cassino]]. The Allies landed at [[Battle of Anzio|Anzio]] on 22 January 1944 with the aim of outflanking the Gustav line and pulling Axis forces out of it so other allied armies could breakthrough. After slow progress, the Germans counterattacked in February but failed to stamp out the Allies; after months of stalemate, the Allies broke out in May 1944 and Rome fell to the Allies on 4 June 1944.\n\nFollowing the Normandy invasion on 6 June 1944, the equivalent of seven US and French divisions were pulled out of Italy to participate in Operation Dragoon: the allied landings in southern France; despite this, the remaining US forces in Italy with other Allied forces pushed up to the [[Gothic line]] in northern Italy, the last major defensive line. From August 1944 to March 1945 the Allies managed to breach the formidable defenses but they narrowly failed to break out into the Lombardy Plains before the winter weather closed in and made further progress impossible. In April 1945 the Allies broke through the remaining Axis positions in [[Spring 1945 offensive in Italy|Operation Grapeshot]] ending the Italian Campaign on 2 May 1945; US forces in mainland Italy suffered between 114,000 and over 119,000 casualties.\n\n===Strategic bombing===\n{{Main|Strategic bombing during World War II#US bombing in Europe|Air warfare of World War II#United States: Army Air Forces}}\n{{stack begin}}\n[[File:Bomber stream.jpg|thumb|250px|alt=|B-17s in flight]]\n[[File:James H.

Using the high altitude [[Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress|B-17]], it was necessary for the raids to be conducted in daylight for the drops to be accurate. As adequate fighter escort was rarely available, the bombers would fly [[Combat box|in tight, box formations]], allowing each bomber to provide overlapping [[Browning M2|machine-gun]] fire for defense. The tight formations made it impossible to evade fire from ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' fighters, however, and American bomber crew losses were high. One such example was the [[Schweinfurt-Regensburg mission]], which resulted in staggering losses of men and equipment. The introduction of the revered [[P-51 Mustang]], which had enough fuel to make a round trip to Germany's heartland, helped to reduce losses later in the war.\n\nIn mid-1942, the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) arrived in the UK and carried out a few raids across the [[English Channel]]. The USAAF [[Eighth Air Force|Eighth Air Force's]] B-17 bombers were called the \"Flying Fortresses\" because of their heavy defensive armament of ten to twelve machine guns, and armor plating in vital locations. In part because of their heavier armament and armor, they carried smaller bomb loads than British bombers. With all of this, the USAAF's commanders in Washington, DC, and in Great Britain adopted the strategy of taking on the Luftwaffe head on, in larger and larger air raids by mutually defending bombers, flying over Germany, Austria, and France at high altitudes during the daytime. Also, both the U.S. Government and its Army Air Forces commanders were reluctant to bomb enemy cities and towns indiscriminately. They claimed that by using the B-17 and the [[Norden bombsight]], the USAAF should be able to carry out \"precision bombing\" on locations vital to the German war machine: factories, naval bases, shipyards, railroad yards, railroad junctions, power plants, steel mills, airfields, etc.\n\nIn January 1943, at the [[Casablanca Conference]], it was agreed [[RAF Bomber Command]] operations against Germany would be reinforced by the USAAF in a Combined Operations Offensive plan called Operation Pointblank. Chief of the British Air Staff MRAF Sir [[Charles Portal, 1st Viscount Portal of Hungerford|Charles Portal]] was put in charge of the \"strategic direction\" of both British and American bomber operations. The text of the Casablanca directive read: \"Your primary object will be the progressive destruction and dislocation of the German military, industrial and economic system and the undermining of the morale of the German people to a point where their capacity for armed resistance is fatally weakened.\", At the beginning of the combined strategic bombing offensive on 4 March 1943 669 RAF and 303 USAAF heavy bombers were available.\n\nIn the late 1943, the 'Pointblank' attacks manifested themselves in the infamous Schweinfurt raids (first and second). Formations of unescorted bombers were no match for German fighters, which inflicted a deadly toll. In despair, the Eighth halted air operations over Germany until a long-range fighter could be found in 1944; it proved to be the P-51 Mustang, which had the range to fly to Berlin and back.\n\nUSAAF leaders firmly held to the claim of \"precision bombing\" of military targets for much of the war, and dismissed claims they were simply bombing cities. However the American Eighth Air Force received the first [[H2X|H2X radar]] sets in December 1943. Within two weeks of the arrival of these first six sets, the Eighth command gave permission for them to area bomb a city using H2X and would continue to authorize, on average, about one such attack a week until the end of the war in Europe.\n\nIn reality, the day bombing was \"precision bombing\" only in the sense that most bombs fell somewhere near a specific designated target such as a railway yard. Conventionally, the air forces designated as \"the target area\" a circle having a radius of 1000 feet around the aiming point of attack. While accuracy improved during the war, Survey studies show that, in the over-all, only about 20% of the bombs aimed at precision targets fell within this target area. In the fall of 1944, only seven percent of all bombs dropped by the Eighth Air Force hit within 1,000 feet of their aim point. The only offensive ordnance possessed by the USAAF that was guidable, the VB-1 [[Azon]], saw very limited service in both Europe and in the [[CBI Theater]] late in the war.\n\nNevertheless, the sheer tonnage of explosive delivered by day and by night was eventually sufficient to cause widespread damage, and, more importantly from a military point of view, forced Germany to divert resources to counter it. This was to be the real significance of the Allied strategic bombing campaign\u2014resource allocation.\nFor the sake of improving the US air-force Fire bombing capabilities a mock-up German Village was built up and repeatedly burned down. It contained full-scale replicas of German residential homes. Fire bombing attacks proved quite successful, in a single 1943 attack on Hamburg roughly 50,000 civilians were killed and practically the entire city destroyed.\n\nWith the arrival of the brand-new [[Fifteenth Air Force]], based in Italy, command of the U.S. Air Forces in Europe was consolidated into the [[United States Strategic Air Forces in Europe|United States Strategic Air Forces]] (USSTAF). With the addition of the Mustang to its strength, the Combined Bomber Offensive was resumed. Planners targeted the Luftwaffe in an operation known as '[[Big Week]]' (20\u201325 February 1944) and succeeded brilliantly \u2013 losses were so heavy German planners were forced into a hasty dispersal of industry and the day fighter arm never fully recovered.\n\nThe dismissal of General [[Ira Eaker]] at the end of 1943 as commander of the [[Eighth Air Force]] and his replacement by American aviation legend, Maj. Gen [[Jimmy Doolittle]] signaled a change in how the American bombing effort went forward over Europe. Doolittle's major influence on the European air war occurred early in the year when he changed the policy requiring escorting fighters to remain with the bombers at all times. With his permission, initially performed with [[P-38]]s and [[P-47 Thunderbolt|P-47]]s with both previous types being  steadily replaced with the long-ranged [[P-51 Mustang|P-51]]s as the spring of 1944 wore on, American fighter pilots on bomber defense missions would primarily be flying far ahead of the bombers' [[combat box]] formations in [[air supremacy]] mode, literally \"clearing the skies\" of any [[Luftwaffe]] fighter opposition heading towards the target. This strategy fatally disabled the twin-engined ''Zerst\u00f6rergeschwader'' [[heavy fighter]] wings and their replacement, single-engined ''Sturmgruppen'' of [[Focke-Wulf Fw 190 operational history#The Sturmb\u00f6cke|heavily armed Fw 190As]], clearing each force of [[bomber destroyer]]s in their turn from Germany's skies throughout most of 1944. As part of this game-changing strategy, especially after the bombers had hit their targets, the USAAF's fighters were then free to strafe German airfields and transport while returning to base, contributing significantly to the achievement of air superiority by Allied air forces over Europe.\n\nOn 27 March 1944, the Combined Chiefs of Staff issued orders granting control of all the Allied air forces in Europe, including strategic bombers, to General Dwight D. Eisenhower, the [[Supreme Allied Commander]], who delegated command to his deputy in [[Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force|SHAEF]] Air Chief Marshal [[Arthur Tedder, 1st Baron Tedder|Arthur Tedder]]. There was resistance to this order from some senior figures, including Winston Churchill, Harris, and [[Carl Spaatz]], but after some debate, control passed to SHAEF on 1 April 1944. When the Combined Bomber Offensive officially ended on 1 April, Allied airmen were well on the way to achieving air superiority over all of Europe. While they continued some strategic bombing, the USAAF along with the RAF turned their attention to the tactical air battle in support of the Normandy Invasion. It was not until the middle of September that the strategic bombing campaign of Germany again became the priority for the USSTAF.\n\nThe twin campaigns\u2014the USAAF by day, the RAF by night\u2014built up into massive bombing of German industrial areas, notably the [[Ruhr]], followed by attacks directly on cities such as [[Hamburg]], [[Kassel]], [[Pforzheim]], [[Mainz]] and the often-criticized [[Bombing of Dresden in World War II|bombing of Dresden]].\n\n===Operation Overlord===\n[[File:Eisenhower d-day.jpg|thumb|250px|alt=|General Eisenhower speaks with members of the 101st Airborne Division on the evening of 5 June 1944]]\n[[File:Approaching Omaha.jpg|thumb|250px|alt=|American troops approaching Omaha Beach]]\n[[File:2nd Infantry Division, E-1 draw, Easy Red sector, Omaha Beach, D+1, June 7, 1944.jpg|thumb|250px|alt=|[[2nd Infantry Division (United States)|2nd Infantry Division]] troops and equipment going up the bluff from Omaha Beach to [[Saint-Laurent-sur-Mer]] on D+1, June 7, 1944.]]\n[[File:Germanprisonerscherbourg.jpg|thumb|250px|German prisoners of war escorted by American soldiers in Cherbourg, 1944.]]\n{{Main|Operation Overlord}}\nThe second European front that the Soviets had pressed for was finally opened on 6 June 1944, when the Allies launched an [[invasion of Normandy]].\nSupreme Allied commander General Dwight D. Eisenhower had delayed the attack because of bad weather, but finally the largest amphibious assault in history began.\n\nAfter prolonged bombing runs on the French coast by the Army Air Forces, 225 [[U.S. Army Rangers]] scaled the cliffs at [[Pointe du Hoc]] under intense enemy fire and destroyed the German gun emplacements that could have threatened the amphibious landings. Also prior to the main amphibious assault, the American [[U.S. 82nd Airborne Division|82nd]] and [[101st Airborne Division|101st]] Airborne divisions dropped behind the beaches into [[German military administration in occupied France during World War II|Nazi-occupied France]], in an effort to protect the coming landings. Many of the [[paratrooper]]s were not dropped on their intended landing zones and were scattered throughout Normandy.\n\nAs the paratroops fought their way through the [[hedgerow]]s, the main amphibious landings began. The Americans came ashore at the beaches codenamed '[[Omaha Beach|Omaha]]' and '[[Utah Beach|Utah]]'. The landing craft bound for Utah, as with so many other units, went off course, coming ashore two kilometers off target. The [[U.S. 4th Infantry Division|4th Infantry Division]] faced weak resistance during the landings and by the afternoon were linked up with paratroopers fighting their way towards the coast.\n\nAt Omaha the Germans had prepared the beaches with [[land mine]]s, [[Czech hedgehog]]s and [[Belgian Gate]]s in anticipation of the invasion. Intelligence prior to the landings had placed the less experienced German 714th Division in charge of the defense of the beach. However, the highly trained and experienced 352nd moved in days before the invasion. As a result, the soldiers from the [[U.S. 1st Infantry Division|1st]] and [[U.S. 29th Infantry Division|29th]] Infantry Divisions became pinned down by superior enemy fire immediately after leaving their landing craft. In some instances, entire landing craft full of men were mowed down by the well-positioned German defenses. As the casualties mounted, the soldiers formed impromptu units and advanced inland.\n\nThe small units then fought their way through the minefields that were in between the Nazi machine-gun bunkers. After squeezing through, they then attacked the bunkers from the rear, allowing more men to come safely ashore.\n\nBy the end of the day, the Americans suffered over 6,000 casualties. [[Omaha Beach]] is the code name for one of the five sectors of the Allied invasion of German-occupied France in the Normandy landings on 6 June 1944, during World War II. The beach is located on the coast of Normandy, France, facing the English Channel, and is 5 miles (8&nbsp;km) long, from east of [[Sainte-Honorine-des-Pertes]] to west of [[Vierville-sur-Mer]] on the right bank of the [[Douve|Douve River]] estuary. Landings here were necessary in order to link up the British landings to the east at [[Gold Beach]] with the American landing to the west at [[Utah Beach]], thus providing a continuous lodgement on the Normandy coast of the [[Baie de la Seine|Bay of the Seine]]. Taking Omaha was to be the responsibility of United States Army troops, with sea transport and naval artillery support provided by the U.S. Navy and elements of the British Royal Navy.\n \nOn D-Day, the untested 29th Infantry Division, joined by the veteran 1st Infantry Division and nine companies of [[United States Army Rangers|U.S. Army Rangers]] redirected from [[Pointe du Hoc]], were to assault the western half of the beach. The battle-hardened 1st Infantry Division was given the eastern half. The initial assault waves, consisting of tanks, infantry, and combat engineer forces, were carefully planned to reduce the coastal defenses and allow the larger ships of the follow-up waves to land.\n \nThe primary objective at Omaha was to secure a beachhead of some five miles (eight kilometers) depth, between [[Port-en-Bessin-Huppain|Port-en-Bessin]] and the [[Vire (river)|Vire River]], linking with the British landings at Gold Beach to the east, and reaching the area of [[Isigny-sur-Mer|Isigny]] to the west to link up with [[VII Corps (United States)|VII Corps]] landing at Utah Beach. Opposing the landings was the German [[352nd Infantry Division]], a large portion of whom were teenagers, though they were supplemented by veterans who had fought on the Eastern Front. The 352nd had never had any battalion or regimental training. Of the 12,020 men of the division, only 6,800 were experienced combat troops, detailed to defend a 53-kilometer-long (33-mile) front. The Germans were largely deployed in strongpoints along the coast\u2014the German strategy was based on defeating any seaborne assault at the water line. Nevertheless, Allied calculations indicated that Omaha's defenses were three times as strong as those they had encountered during the Battle of Kwajalein, and its defenders were four times as many.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\nVery little went as planned during the landing at Omaha Beach. Difficulties in navigation caused the majority of landing craft to miss their targets throughout the day. The defenses were unexpectedly strong, and inflicted heavy casualties on landing US troops. Under heavy fire, the engineers struggled to clear the beach obstacles; later landings bunched up around the few channels that were cleared. Weakened by the casualties taken just in landing, the surviving assault troops could not clear the heavily defended exits off the beach. This caused further problems and consequent delays for later landings. Small penetrations were eventually achieved by groups of survivors making improvised assaults, scaling the bluffs between the most heavily defended points. By the end of the day, two small isolated footholds had been won, which were subsequently exploited against weaker defenses further inland, thus achieving the original D-Day objectives over the following days\uff0e\n\nWith the Beaches secured, the Allies needed to secure a deep-water port to allow reinforcements to be brought in, with American forces at the base of the [[Cotentin Peninsula]] the target was [[Battle of Cherbourg|Cherbourg]], at the end of the Cotentin. The US [[VII Corps (United States)|VII Corps]] immediately began making their push after the beaches were secured on 6 June, facing mix of weak regiments and battlegroups from several divisions who used the [[bocage]] terrain, flooded fields and narrow roads to their advantage which slowed the American advance. After being reinforced, VII corps took control of the peninsula in fierce fighting on 19 June and launched their assault on Cherbourg on 22 June. The German garrison surrendered on 29 June, but by this time they had destroyed the port facilities, which were not made fully operational until September.{{sfn|Ford|Zaloga|2009|pp=185\u2013193}}\n\n===Battle of Saint-L\u00f4 ===\n{{Main|Battle of Saint-L\u00f4}}\nThe Battle of Saint-L\u00f4 is one of the three conflicts in the Battle of the Hedgerows (fr), which took place between 9\u201324 July 1944, just before Operation Cobra. Saint-L\u00f4 had fallen to Germany in 1940, and, after the Invasion of Normandy, the Americans targeted the city, as it served as a strategic crossroads. American bombardments caused heavy damage (up to 95% of the city was destroyed) and a high number of casualties, which resulted in the martyr city being called \"The Capital of Ruins\", popularized in a report by Samuel Beckett\n\n===Battle of Carentan ===\n{{Main|Battle of Carentan}}\nThe Battle of Carentan was an engagement between airborne forces of the United States Army and the German Wehrmacht during the Battle of Normandy. The battle took place between 10\u201315 June 1944, on the approaches to and within the city of [[Carentan]], France.\n\nThe objective of the attacking American forces was consolidation of the U.S. beachheads (Utah Beach and Omaha Beach) and establishment of a continuous defensive line against expected German counterattacks. The defending German force attempted to hold the city long enough to allow reinforcements en route from the south to arrive, prevent or delay the merging of the lodgments, and keep the U.S. First Army from launching an attack towards Lessay-P\u00e9riers that would cut off the [[Cotentin Peninsula]].\n\nCarentan was defended by two battalions of Fallschirmj\u00e4ger-Regiment 6 (6th Parachute Regiment) of the 2nd Fallschirmj\u00e4ger-Division and two Ost battalions. The 17th SS Panzergrenadier Division, ordered to reinforce Carentan, was delayed by transport shortages and attacks by Allied aircraft. The attacking 101st Airborne Division, landed by parachute on 6 June as part of the American airborne landings in Normandy, was ordered to seize Carentan.\n\nIn the ensuing battle, the 101st forced passage across the causeway into Carentan on 10\u201311 June. A lack of ammunition forced the German forces to withdraw on 12 June. The 17th SS PzG Division counter-attacked the 101st Airborne on 13 June. Initially successful, its attack was thrown back by Combat Command A (CCA) of the U.S. 2nd Armored Division\n\n===Operation Cobra===\n{{Main|Operation Cobra}}\nAfter the amphibious assault, the Allied forces remained stalled in Normandy for some time, advancing much more slowly than expected with close-fought infantry battles in the dense hedgerows. However, with Operation Cobra, launched on 24 July with mostly American troops, the Allies succeeded in breaking the German lines and sweeping out into France with fast-moving armored divisions. This led to a major defeat for the Germans, with 400,000 soldiers trapped in the [[Falaise pocket]], and the capture of Paris on 25 August.\n\n===Operation L\u00fcttich===\n{{main|Operation L\u00fcttich}}\n\nOperation L\u00fcttich was a code name given to a German counter-attack during the Battle of Normandy, which took place around the American positions near Mortain from 7\u201313 August 1944. (L\u00fcttich is the German name for the city of Li\u00e8ge in Belgium, where the Germans had won a victory in the early days of August 1914 during World War I.) The offensive is also referred to in American and British histories of the Battle of Normandy as the Mortain counter-offensive.\n\nThe assault was ordered by Adolf Hitler, to eliminate the gains made by the First United States Army during Operation Cobra and the subsequent weeks, and by reaching the coast in the region of Avranches at the base of the Cotentin peninsula, cut off the units of the Third United States Army which had advanced into Brittany.\n\nThe main German striking force was the [[XLVII Panzer Corps]], with one and a half SS Panzer Divisions and two Wehrmacht Panzer Divisions. Although they made initial gains against the defending U.S. VII Corps, they were soon halted and Allied aircraft inflicted severe losses on the attacking troops, eventually destroying nearly half of the German tanks involved in the attack.[2] Although fighting continued around Mortain for six days, the American forces had regained the initiative within a day of the opening of the German attack.\n\nAs the German commanders on the spot had warned Hitler in vain, there was little chance of the attack succeeding, and the concentration of their armored reserves at the western end of the front in Normandy soon led to disaster, as they were outflanked to their south and the front to their east collapsed, resulting in many of the German troops in Normandy being trapped in the Falaise Pocket.\n\n===Falaise Pocket===\n{{main|Falaise Pocket}}\nFollowing Operation Cobra, the American breakout from the Normandy beachhead, rapid advances were made to the south and south-east by the [[United States Army Central|Third U.S. Army]] under the command of General George Patton. Despite lacking the resources to defeat the U.S. breakthrough and simultaneous British and Canadian offensives south of [[Caumont-l'\u00c9vent\u00e9|Caumont]] and [[Caen]], Field Marshal [[G\u00fcnther von Kluge]], the commander of [[Army Group B]], was not permitted by Hitler to withdraw but was ordered to conduct a counter-offensive at [[Mortain]] against the U.S. breakthrough. Four depleted panzer divisions were not enough to defeat the First U.S. Army. Operation L\u00fcttich was a disaster, which drove the Germans deeper into the Allied envelopment.\n\nOn 8 August, the Allied ground forces commander, General Bernard Montgomery, ordered the Allied armies to converge on the Falaise\u2013Chambois area to envelop Army Group B, the First U.S. Army forming the southern arm, the [[Second Army (United Kingdom)|British Second Army]] the base and the [[First Canadian Army]] the northern arm of the encirclement. The Germans began to withdraw on 17\u201319 August, and the Allies linked up in Chambois. Gaps were forced in the Allied lines by German counter-attacks, the biggest being a corridor forced past the [[1st Armoured Division (Poland)|1st Polish Armored Division]] on [[Hill 262]], a commanding position at the mouth of the pocket. By the evening of 21 August, the pocket had been sealed, with c.\u200950,000 Germans trapped inside. Many Germans escaped but losses in men and equipment were huge. Two days later the Allied Liberation of Paris was completed and on 30 August, the remnants of Army Group B retreated across the Seine, which ended Operation Overlord.\n\n===Operation Dragoon===\n{{main|Operation Dragoon}}\nOn 15 August 1944, the [[Seventh United States Army|US 7th Army]], spearheaded by the [[3rd Infantry Division (United States)|3rd Infantry Division]] and [[36th Infantry Division (United States)|36th Infantry Division]] and other Allied forces landed in southern France between [[Cannes]] and [[Hy\u00e8res]]. The aim of the operation was to secure the southern half of France and one objective in particular was to capture [[Marseille]] as a main supply harbor for the Allies in France. The operation was a success and forced the German [[Army Group G]] to abandon southern France and to retreat under constant Allied attacks to the [[Vosges Mountains]]. By the time the operation finished on 14 September 1944, US forces suffered 2,050 killed, captured or missing 7,750 other casualties, on 15 September 1944 the Allied forces of the operation were renamed the [[Sixth United States Army Group|Sixth Army Group]] and placed under Eisenhower's command.\n\n===Operation Market Garden===\n{{Main|Operation Market Garden}}\n{{See also|Operation Market Garden order of battle}}\n\n[[File:Waves of paratroops land in Holland.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Paratroopers landing in the Netherlands.]]\n\nThe next major Allied operation came on 17 September. Devised by British General Bernard Montgomery, its primary objective was the capture of several bridges in the Netherlands. Fresh off of their successes in Normandy, the Allies were optimistic that an attack on the Nazi-occupied Netherlands would force open a route across the [[Rhine]] and onto the [[Northern European Lowlands|North German Plain]]. Such an opening would allow Allied forces to break out northward and advance toward [[Denmark]] and, ultimately, Berlin.\n\nThe plan involved a daylight drop of the American 82nd and 101st Airborne Divisions. The 101st was to capture the bridges at [[Eindhoven]], with the 82nd taking the bridges at [[Grave, Netherlands|Grave]] and [[Nijmegen]]. After the bridges had been captured, the ground force, also known as [[XXX Corps (United Kingdom)|XXX Corps]] or \"Garden\", would drive up a single road and link up with the paratroops.\n\nThe operation failed because the Allies were unable to capture the bridge furthest to the north at [[Arnhem]]. There, the [[1st Airborne Division (United Kingdom)|British 1st Airborne]] had been dropped to secure the bridges, but upon landing they discovered that a highly experienced German [[9th SS Panzer Division Hohenstaufen|SS Panzer unit]] was garrisoning the town. The paratroopers were only lightly equipped in respect to anti-tank weaponry and quickly lost ground. Failure to quickly relieve those members of the 1st who had managed to seize the bridge at Arnhem on the part of the armored [[XXX Corps (United Kingdom)|XXX Corps]], meant that the Germans were able to stymie the entire operation. In the end, the operation's ambitious nature, the fickle state of war, and failures on the part of Allied intelligence (as well as tenacious German defense) can be blamed for Market-Garden's ultimate failure. This operation also signaled the last time that either the 82nd or 101st would make a combat jump during the war.\n\n===Operation Queen===\n{{Main|Battle of H\u00fcrtgen Forest|Operation Queen}}\nUnable to push north into the Netherlands, the Allies in western Europe were forced to consider other options to get into Germany. In the summer of 1944, the Allies suffered from a large supply crisis, due to the long supply route.  But by the fall of 1944, this has largely been resolved ([[Red Ball Express]]). As part of the [[Allied advance from Paris to the Rhine|Siegfriend Line Campaign]], the Allies tried to push into Germany towards the Rhine. As a first step, [[Aachen]] was captured during a [[Battle of Aachen|heavy battle]]. The Germans now had the advantage of their old fortification system, the [[Siegfried line]]. During the [[Battle of H\u00fcrtgen Forest]], the Allies fought a long battle of attrition with the Germans, which ended initially in a stalemate, with the Allies unable to take the complete forest. The battle of the H\u00fcrtgen Forest was later absorbed by a larger offensive, [[Operation Queen]]. During this offensive, the Allies intended to push towards the Ruhr, as a staging point for a subsequent thrust over the river to the [[Rhine]] into Germany. However, against underestimated and stiffened German resistance, the Allies were only able to make slow progress. By mid-December the Allies were finally at the Rur, but by then the Germans had prepared their own offensive through the Ardennes, which was launched in the midst of an unsuccessful Allied attack against the Rur dams.\n\n===Battle of the Bulge===\n{{Main|Battle of the Bulge|Battle of Bastogne|Operation Nordwind}}\n\n[[File:Wacht am Rhein map.svg|thumb|150px|The \"bulge\" created by the German offensive.]]\n[[File:American tank destroyers.jpg|thumb|150px|American tank destroyers move forward during heavy fog to stem German spearhead near Werbomont, Belgium, 20 December 1944.]]\n[[File:101st Airborne troops move out of Bastogne.jpg|thumb|150px|Troops of the 101st Airborne move out of Bastogne, after having been besieged there for ten days, 31 December 1944.]]\n\nOn 16 December 1944, the Germans launched a massive attack westward in the [[Ardennes]] forest, along a battlefront extending southwards from [[Monschau]] to [[Echternach]], hoping to punch a hole in the Allied lines and capture the Belgian city of [[Antwerp]]. The Allies responded slowly, allowing  the German attack to create a large \"bulge\" in the Allied lines. In the initial stages of the offensive, American [[POW]]<nowiki/>s from the [[285th Field Artillery Observation Battalion]] were executed at the [[Malmedy massacre]] by Nazi [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] and [[Fallschirmj\u00e4ger (World War II)|Fallschirmj\u00e4ger]].\n\nAs the Germans pushed westward, General Eisenhower ordered the 101st Airborne and elements of the [[U.S. 10th Armored Division]] into the road junction town of [[Bastogne]] to prepare a defense. The town quickly became cut off and surrounded. The winter weather slowed Allied air support, and the defenders were outnumbered and low on supplies. When given a request for their surrender from the Germans, General [[Anthony McAuliffe]], acting commander of the 101st, replied, \"Nuts!\", contributing to the stubborn American defense.<ref>[http://www.thedropzone.org/europe/Bulge/kinnard.html \"\"NUTS!\" Revisited: An Interview with Lt.

Patton then turned his army, at the time on the front in [[Luxembourg]], north to break through to Bastogne. Patton's armor pushed north, and by 26 December was in Bastogne, effectively ending the siege. By the time it was over, more American soldiers had served in the battle than in any engagement in American history.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20041215114142/http://www.defenselink.mil/news/Dec2004/n12142004_2004121406.html \"Battle of the Bulge remembered 60 years later\".] defenselink.mil</ref>\n\nOn 31 December, the Germans launched their last major offensive of the war on the Western Front, [[Operation Nordwind]], in [[Alsace]] and [[Lorraine (province)|Lorraine]] in northeastern France. Against weakened American forces there, the Germans were able to push the Americans back to the south bank of the [[Moder River]] on 21 January. On 25 January, Allied reinforcements from the Ardennes arrived, the German offensive was stopped and in fierce fighting the so-called [[Colmar Pocket]] was eliminated.\n\nThe German offensive was supported by several subordinate operations known as Unternehmen Bodenplatte, Greif, and W\u00e4hrung. Germany's goal for these operations was to split the British and American Allied line in half, capturing Antwerp and then proceed to encircle and destroy four Allied armies, forcing the Western Allies to negotiate a peace treaty in favor of the Axis powers. Once accomplished, Hitler could fully concentrate on the eastern theater of war.\n \nThe offensive was planned with the utmost secrecy, minimizing radio traffic and moving troops and equipment under cover of darkness. The Third U.S. Army's intelligence staff predicted a major German offensive, and [[Ultra]] indicated that a \"substantial and offensive\" operation was expected or \"in the wind\", although a precise date or point of attack could not be given. Aircraft movement from the Soviet Front to the Ardennes and transport of forces by rail to the Ardennes was noticed but not acted upon, according to a report later written by [[Peter Calvocoressi]] and [[F. L. Lucas]] at the code breaking center [[Bletchley Park]].\n \nNear-complete surprise was achieved by a combination of Allied overconfidence, preoccupation with Allied offensive plans, and poor aerial reconnaissance. The Germans attacked a weakly defended section of the Allied line, taking advantage of a heavy overcast, which grounded the Allies' overwhelmingly superior air forces. Fierce resistance on the northern shoulder of the offensive around [[Battle of Elsenborn Ridge|Elsenborn Ridge]] and in the south around [[Siege of Bastogne|Bastogne]] blocked German access to key roads to the west that they counted on for success. This and terrain that favored the defenders threw the German timetable behind schedule and allowed the Allies to reinforce the thinly placed troops. Improved weather conditions permitted air attacks on German forces and supply lines, which sealed the failure of the offensive. In the wake of the defeat, many experienced German units were left severely depleted of men and equipment, as survivors retreated to the defenses of the Siegfried Line.\n \nWith about 610,000 men committed and some 89,000 casualties, including 19,000 killed, the Battle of the Bulge was the largest and bloodiest battle fought by the United States in World War II.\n\n===Colmar Pocket ===\n{{Main|Colmar Pocket}}\nThe Colmar Pocket (French: Poche de Colmar; German: Br\u00fcckenkopf Elsa\u00df) was the area held in central [[Alsace]], France by the [[19th Army (Wehrmacht)|German Nineteenth Army]] from November 1944 \u2013 February 1945, against the U.S. 6th Army Group during World War II. It was formed when 6th AG liberated southern and northern Alsace and adjacent eastern Lorraine, but could not clear central Alsace.

It was formed when 6th AG liberated southern and northern Alsace and adjacent eastern Lorraine, but could not clear central Alsace. During Operation Nordwind in December 1944, the 19th Army attacked north out of the Pocket in support of other German forces attacking south from the Saar into northern Alsace. In late January and early February 1945, the French First Army (reinforced by the U.S. XXI Corps) cleared the Pocket of German forces.\n\n=== Invasion of Germany ===\n{{Main|Western Allied invasion of Germany}}\nBy early 1945, events favored the Allied forces in Europe. On the Western Front the Allies had been fighting in Germany since the [[Battle of Aachen]] in October 1944 and by January had turned back the Germans in the Battle of the Bulge. The failure of this last major German offensive exhausted much of Germany's remaining combat strength, leaving it ill-prepared to resist the final Allied campaigns in Europe. Additional losses in the Rhineland further weakened the German Army, leaving shattered remnants of units to defend the east bank of the Rhine. On 7 March, the Allies seized the last remaining intact bridge across the Rhine at Remagen, and had established a large bridgehead on the river's east bank. During [[Operation Lumberjack]] and [[Operation Plunder]] in February\u2013March 1945, German casualties are estimated at 400,000 men, including 280,000 men captured as prisoners of war.\n\n===South German Offensive===\n\nThe South German Offensive is the general name of one of the final offensives of World War II in Europe. The offensive was led by the Seventh and Third armies of the United States along with the [[1st Army (France)|First Army of France]]. Soviet troops linked up with American forces in [[Czechoslovakia]] notably in the [[Battle of Slivice]].{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} The offensive was made by the US 6th Army Group to protect the 12th Army Group's right flank and to prevent a German last stand in the Alps. However German resistance was much more fierce than in the north, which slowed the 6th Army Group's progress. However, by the end of April, many German divisions surrendered without a fight to the advancing American forces to avoid the inevitable destruction. The [[VI Corps (United States)|VI Corps]] of the Seventh Army linked up with the [[US Fifth Army]], which fought through Italy, in the Alps as the Third Army advanced into [[Austria]] and Czechoslovakia, where it linked up with Soviet forces advancing from the east. Fighting continued a few days after the [[German Instrument of Surrender|Surrender of Germany]] on 8 May, due to German forces fighting west to surrender to the Americans instead of the Soviets.\n\n===Race to Berlin===\nFollowing the defeat of the German army in the Ardennes, the Allies pushed back towards the Rhine and the heart of Germany. With the capture of the [[Ludendorff Bridge]] at [[Remagen]], the Allies crossed the Rhine in March 1945. The Americans then executed a [[pincer movement]], setting up the [[U.S. Ninth Army|Ninth Army]] north, and the [[U.S. First Army|First Army]] south. When the Allies closed the pincer, 300,000 Germans were captured in the [[Ruhr Pocket]]. The Americans then turned east, first meeting up with the Soviets at [[Torgau]] on the [[Elbe River]] in April. The Germans surrendered Berlin to the Soviets on 2 May 1945.\n\nThe war in Europe came to an official end on [[Victory in Europe Day|V-E Day]], 8 May 1945.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.historynet.com/world-war-ii|title= World War II|last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= |website= Historynet.com|publisher= |accessdate= 13 January 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Pacific Theater==\n{{Main|Pacific War}}\n{{See also|Asiatic-Pacific Theater}}\n[[File:Ww2-asia-overview.gif|thumb|350px|The conquests of Imperial Japan.]]\n\n===The Attack on Pearl Harbor===\n[[File:Pearlharborcolork13513.jpg|thumb|Explosion of the battleship {{USS|Arizona|BB-39|6}} at Pearl Harbor.]]\n{{Main|Attack on Pearl Harbor}}\n\nBecause of Japanese advances in [[French Indochina]] and China, the United States, in coordination with the British and Dutch, cut off all oil supplies to Japan, which had imported 90% of its oil. The oil embargo threatened to grind the Japanese military machine to a halt. Japan refused American demands to leave China and decided that war with the United States was inevitable; its only hope was to strike first. President Roosevelt had months earlier transferred the American fleet to Hawaii from California in order to deter the Japanese. Admiral [[Isoroku Yamamoto]] argued the only way to win the war was to knock out the powerful main American fleet immediately. His fleet approached within 200 miles of Hawaii without being detected. Admiral [[Ch\u016bichi Nagumo]] held tactical command. Over a five-hour period his six carriers sent two waves of 360 dive-bombers, torpedo planes, and fighters. They destroyed or severely damaged eight battleships, ten smaller warships, and 230 aircraft; 2,403 American servicemen and civilians were killed. Japanese losses were negligible\u201429 planes shot down (several American planes were also shot down by anti-aircraft fire). Commander [[Minoru Genda]], the chief planner of the raid, begged Nagumo to strike again at the shore facilities, oil storage tanks, and submarines, and to hunt down the American carriers that were supposedly nearby. But Nagumo decided not to risk further action. To reach Pearl Harbor, they had to learn how to refuel at sea (a technique the US Navy already had worked out); to sink all those ships they used their electric torpedoes and shallow-water bombing tactics. Despite later rumors, there was no advance knowledge of the Japanese plan. The commanders had been complacent about routine defensive measures. In broader perspective, the attack was a failure. The lost battleships reflected obsolete doctrine and were not needed; the lost planes were soon replaced; the casualty list was short by [[World War II]] standards. Tokyo's calculation that the Americans would lose heart and seek a compromise peace proved wildly wrong\u2014the \"sneak attack\" electrified public opinion, committing America with near unanimity to a war to the death against the Japanese Empire.<ref>Gordon W.

The Japanese army invaded and trapped the American and Filipino forces on the Bataan peninsula. Roosevelt evacuated General [[Douglas MacArthur]] and the nurses, but there was no way to save the trapped men against overwhelming Japanese naval power. MacArthur flew to Australia, vowing \"I came out of Bataan and I shall return.\"  [[Jonathan Mayhew Wainwright IV|Major General Jonathan M. Wainwright]] surrendered on 8 May; the prisoners died by the thousands in the [[Bataan Death March]] and in disease-ridden Japanese prison camps where food and medicine were in very short supply.<ref>Donald J. Young, ''The Battle of Bataan: A Complete History'' (2009)</ref>\n\nThe Japanese Navy seemed unstoppable as they seized the [[Dutch East Indies]] to gain its rich oil resources. The American, British, Dutch, and Australian forces were combined under the [[American-British-Dutch-Australian Command|ABDA]] command but its fleet was quickly sunk in [[Dutch East Indies campaign|several naval battles around Java]].\n\n===Solomon Islands and New Guinea Campaign===\n{{Main|Solomon Islands campaign}}\n\nFollowing their rapid advance, the Japanese started the Solomon Islands Campaign from their newly conquered main base at [[Rabaul]] in January 1942. The Japanese seized several islands including Tulagi and Guadalcanal, before they were halted by further events leading to the [[Guadalcanal Campaign]]. This campaign also converged with the [[New Guinea campaign]].\n\n===Battle of the Coral Sea===\n{{Main|Battle of the Coral Sea}}\n{{See also|Battle of the Coral Sea order of battle}}\n\nIn May 1942, the United States fleet engaged the Japanese fleet during the first battle in history in which neither fleet fired directly on the other, nor did the ships of both fleets actually see each other. It was also the first time that aircraft carriers were used in battle. While indecisive, it was nevertheless a starting point because American commanders learned the tactics that would serve them later in the war. These tactics proved immediately helpful at the battle of Midway only one month later. An excerpt from the Naval War College Review says that \"although the Coral Sea fight was a marginal tactical victory for the IJN [Imperial Japanese Navy], in terms of ships and tonnage sunk, it amounted to a small strategic triumph for the U.S. Navy.\" <ref>{{cite journal |last1=Hodge |first1=Carl Cavanagh |title=The Key to Midway: Coral Sea and a Culture of Learning|journal=Naval War College Review |date=2015 |volume=68 |issue=1 |page=121 |jstor=26397819 |publisher=U.S. Naval War College Press }}</ref>\n\n===Battle of the Aleutian Islands===\n{{Main|Aleutian Islands Campaign}}\nThe Battle of the Aleutian Islands was the last battle between sovereign nations to be fought on America soil. As part of a diversionary plan for the Battle of Midway, the Japanese took control of two of the Aleutian Islands ([[Attu Island|Attu]] and [[Kiska]] Island). Their hope was that strong American naval forces would be drawn away from Midway, enabling a Japanese victory. Because their [[ciphers]] were broken, the American forces only drove the Japanese out after Midway. On 11 May 1943, American and Canadian forces, spearheaded by the [[7th Infantry Division (United States)|U.S. 7th Infantry Division]] landed on Attu, beginning the operation to take back the islands, by the end of May 1943 and after a series of battles, Allied forces retook Attu. On 15 August 1943, Allied forces landed on Kiska to retake it, only to find the Island abandoned by the Japanese.\n\n===Battle of Midway===\n{{Main|Battle of Midway}}\n{{See also|Midway order of battle}}\n[[File:Japanese aircraft carrier Hiryu burning on 5 June 1942 (NH 73064).jpg|thumb|250px|The Japanese carrier [[Japanese aircraft carrier Hiry\u016b|''Hiryu'']] burning after being attacked during the [[battle of Midway]]]]\n\nHaving learned important lessons at Coral Sea, the United States Navy was prepared when the Japanese navy under [[Isoroku Yamamoto|Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto]] launched an offensive aimed at destroying the American Pacific Fleet at Midway Island. The Japanese hoped to embarrass the Americans after the humiliation of the [[Doolittle Raid]] on Tokyo. Midway was a strategic island that both sides wished to use as an air base. Yamamoto hoped to achieve complete surprise and a quick capture of the island, followed by a decisive carrier battle with which he could completely destroy the American carrier fleet. Before the battle began, however, American intelligence intercepted his plan, allowing [[Chester Nimitz|Admiral Chester Nimitz]] to formulate an effective defensive ambush of the Japanese fleet.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/19990508131513/http://www.history.navy.mil/photos/events/wwii-pac/midway/midway.htm \"Battle of Midway, June 4-7, 1942\"] history.navy.mil</ref>  The battle began on 4 June 1942. By the time it was over, the Japanese had lost four carriers, as opposed to one American carrier lost. The Battle of Midway was the turning point of the war in the Pacific because the United States had seized the initiative and was on the offensive for the remaining duration of the war.\n\n===Island hopping===\nFollowing the resounding victory at Midway, the United States began a major land offensive. The Allies came up with a strategy known as [[Leapfrogging (strategy)|Island hopping]], or the bypassing of islands that either served little or no strategic importance<ref>[http://www.u-s-history.com/pages/h1671.html \"Pacific Theater, World War II \u2014 Island Hopping, 1942\u20131945\"], USHistory.com.</ref> or were heavily defended but could be bypassed, such as [[Rabaul#World War II|Rabaul]]. Because air power was crucial to any operation, only islands that could support airstrips were targeted by the Allies. The fighting for each island in the Pacific Theater would be savage, as the Americans faced a determined and battle-hardened enemy who had known little defeat on the ground.\n\n====Air strategy====\n[[File:Lockheed P-38J Lightning - 1.jpg|thumb|300px|P-38 Lightning]]\nGeneral [[George Kenney]], in charge of tactical air power under MacArthur, never had enough planes, pilots or supplies.<ref>George Kenney, ''General Kenney reports: a personal history of the Pacific War'' (Office of Air Force History \u2013 1949) [https://books.google.com/books?id=tWdbngbCc84C&printsec=frontcover&dq=intitle:Kenney+intitle:Reports+inauthor:kenney&hl=en&ei=ias7TsLSDqrSiAK0-pH3Cw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CCoQ6AEwAA full text online]</ref>   (He was not allowed any authority whatsoever over the Navy's carriers.) But the Japanese were always in worse shape\u2014their equipment  deteriorated rapidly because of poor airfields and incompetent maintenance. The Japanese had excellent planes and pilots in 1942, but ground commanders dictated their missions and ignored the need for air superiority before any other mission could be attempted. Theoretically, Japanese doctrine stressed the need to gain air superiority, but the infantry commanders repeatedly wasted air assets defending minor positions. When Arnold, echoing the official Army line, stated the Pacific was a \"defensive\" theater, Kenney retorted that the Japanese pilot was always on the offensive.  \"He attacks all the time and persists in acting that way. To defend against him you not only have to attack him but to beat him to the punch.\"<ref>Quoted in [[William M. Leary]], ''We Shall Return!: MacArthur's Commanders and the Defeat of Japan'' (2004) p. 99</ref>\n\nA key to Kenney's strategy was the neutralization of bypassed Japanese strongpoints like Rabaul and Truk through repeated bombings. He said a major shortfall was \"the kids coming here from the States were green as grass. They were not getting enough gunnery, acrobatics, formation flying, or night flying.\"<ref>Kenney p 112</ref>  So he set up extensive retraining programs. The arrival of  superior fighters, especially the twin-tailed [[Lockheed P-38 Lightning]], gave the Americans an edge in range and performance. Occasionally a ripe target appeared, as in the [[Battle of the Bismarck Sea]] (March 1943) when bombers sank a major convoy bringing troops and supplies to New Guinea. That success was no fluke. High-flying bombers almost never could hit moving ships. Kenney solved that weakness by teaching pilots the effective new tactic of flying in close to the water then pulling up and lobbing bombs that skipped across the water and into the target.<ref>Martin W. Bowman, ''B-17 Flying Fortress Units of the Pacific War'' (2003) p. 59</ref>\n\n=====Building airfields=====\nThe goal of island hopping was to build forward air fields. AAF commander General Hap Arnold correctly anticipated that he would have to build forward airfields in inhospitable places. Working closely with the Army Corps of Engineers, he created Aviation Engineer Battalions that by 1945 included 118,000 men; it operated in all theaters. Runways, hangars, radar stations, power generators, barracks, gasoline storage tanks and ordnance dumps had to be built hurriedly on tiny coral islands, mud flats, featureless deserts, dense jungles, or exposed locations still under enemy artillery fire. The heavy construction gear had to be imported, along with the engineers, blueprints, steel-mesh landing mats, prefabricated hangars, aviation fuel, bombs and ammunition, and all necessary supplies. As soon as one project was finished the battalion would load up its gear and move forward to the next challenge, while headquarters inked in a new airfield on the maps. Heavy rains often reduced the capacity of old airfields, so new ones were built. Often engineers had to repair and use a captured enemy airfield. Unlike the well-built German air fields in Europe, the Japanese installations were ramshackle affairs with poor siting, poor drainage, scant protection, and narrow, bumpy runways. Engineering was a low priority for the offense-minded Japanese, who chronically lacked adequate equipment and imagination.<ref>Wesley Frank Craven and James Lea Cate, ''The Army Air Forces In World War  II: Vol 7: Services Around The World'' (1958) ch 10</ref>\n\n====Combat experience====\nAirmen flew far more often in the Southwest Pacific than in Europe, and although rest time in Australia was scheduled, there was no fixed number of missions that would produce transfer out of combat, as was the case in Europe. Coupled with the monotonous, hot, sickly environment, the result was bad morale that jaded veterans quickly passed along to newcomers. After a few months, epidemics of combat fatigue (now called [[Combat stress reaction]]) would drastically reduce the efficiency of units. The men who had been at jungle airfields longest, the flight surgeons reported, were in a bad shape:\n::Many have chronic dysentery or other disease, and almost all show chronic fatigue states. . . .They appear listless, unkempt, careless, and apathetic with almost masklike facial expression. Speech is slow, thought content is poor, they complain of chronic headaches, insomnia, memory defect, feel forgotten, worry about themselves, are afraid of new assignments, have no sense of responsibility, and are hopeless about the future.\"<ref>Mae Mills Link and Hubert A. Coleman, ''Medical support of the Army Air Forces in World War II'' (1955) p 851</ref>\n{{check quotation}}\n====Marine Aviation and the issue of ground support====\n[[File:Vought F4U-1 Corsairs of VF-17 in flight, 1943.jpg|left|thumb|Chance-Vought F4U Corsair, 1943]]\nThe Marines had their own land-based aviation, built around the excellent [[Vought F4U Corsair|Chance-Vought F4U Corsair]], an unusually large fighter-bomber. By 1944 10,000 Marine pilots operated 126 combat squadrons. Marine Aviation originally had the mission of close support for ground troops, but it dropped that role in the 1920s and 1930s and became a junior component of naval aviation. The new mission was to protect the fleet from enemy air attacks. Marine pilots, like all aviators, fiercely believed in the prime importance of air superiority; they did not wish to be tied down to supporting ground troops. On the other hand, the ground Marines needed close air support because they lacked heavy firepower of their own. Mobility was a basic mission of Marine ground forces; they were too lightly armed to employ the sort of heavy artillery barrages and massed tank movements the Army used to clear the battlefield. The Japanese were so well dug in that Marines often needed air strikes on positions 300 to 1,500 yards  ahead. In 1944, after considerable internal acrimony, Marine Aviation was forced to start helping out. At Iwo Jima ex-pilots in the air liaison party (ALP) not only requested air support, but actually directed it in tactical detail. The Marine formula increased responsiveness, reduced \"friendly\" casualties, and (flying weather permitting) substituted well for the missing armor and artillery. For the next half century close air support would remain central to the mission of Marine Aviation, provoking eternal jealousy from the Army which was never allowed to operate fixed-wing fighters or bombers, although the Army was allowed to have \nsome unarmed transports and spotter planes.<ref>Robert Lee Sherrod, ''History of Marine Corps Aviation in World War II'' (1952)</ref>\n\n====Guadalcanal====\n{{Main|Guadalcanal Campaign}}\n{{See also|Battle of Guadalcanal order of battle}}\n[[File:GuadLandingsLunga.jpg|thumb|U.S. Marines debark from [[LCPL|LCP(L)s]] onto Guadalcanal on August 7, 1942.]]\nGuadalcanal, fought from August 1942 to February 1943,  was the first major Allied offensive of the war in the Pacific Theater. This campaign pitted American air, naval and ground forces (later augmented by Australians and New Zealanders) against determined Japanese resistance. Guadalcanal was the key to control the [[Solomon Islands]], which both sides saw as strategically essential. Both sides won some battles but both sides were overextended in terms of supply lines. Logistical failures in a hostile physical environment hampered everyone. As happened time and again in the Pacific, the Japanese logistical support system failed, as only 20% of the supplies dispatched from Rabaul to Guadalcanal ever reached there. Consequently, the 30,000 Japanese troops lacked heavy equipment, adequate ammunition and even enough food; 10,000 were killed, 10,000 starved to death, and the remaining 10,000 were evacuated in February 1943. In the end Guadalcanal was a major American victory as the Japanese inability to keep pace with the rate of American reinforcements proved decisive. Guadalcanal is an iconic episode in the annals of American military history, underscoring heroic bravery of underequipped individuals in fierce combat with a determined foe.<ref>Charles W. Koburger, ''Pacific Turning Point: The Solomons Campaign, 1942\u20131943'' (1995) [https://www.questia.com/read/24131412 online edition]</ref>\n\nMarines from the [[1st Marine Division (United States)|1st Marine Division]] landed on 7 August 1942, soldiers from the Army [[XIV Corps (United States)|XIV Corps]] reinforced and eventually replaced in late-November 1942. They quickly captured [[Honiara International Airport|Henderson Field]], and prepared defenses. In the [[Battle of Edson's Ridge|Battle of Bloody Ridge]], the Americans held off wave after wave of Japanese counterattacks before charging what was left of the Japanese. After more than six months of combat the island was firmly in control of the Allies on 8 February 1943.\n[[File:Casta-MAP Guadalcanal-battles3.jpg|thumb|Guadalcanal showing several Naval battles.]]\n\nMeanwhile, the rival navies fought seven battles, with the two sides diving the victories.<ref>Samuel Eliot Morison, ''History of United States Naval Operations in World War II. Vol. 5: The Struggle for Guadalcanal, August 1942 \u2013 February 1943'' (1949)</ref> Following the Japanese victory at the [[Battle of Savo Island]] on 8\u20139 August, Admiral Fletcher withdrew his ships from around Guadalcanal. A second Japanese naval force sailed south and engaged the American fleet in the [[Battle of the Eastern Solomons]] on 24\u201325 August, ending in a draw but forced the Japanese naval force to retreat. On 11\u201312 October 1942,  to disrupt Japanese attempts to reinforce and resupply their troops on Guadalcanal (nicknamed the \"Tokyo Express\"), a small US naval force attacked this supply lines at the [[Battle of Cape Esperance]] and succeeded. In support of the Japanese ground offensive in October, Japanese naval forces engaged and hoped to decisively defeat any US naval forces in the area of operation at the [[Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands]] on 25\u201327 October 1942, however the Japanese failed to decisively defeat US Navy. From 12\u201315 November 1942, the [[Naval Battle of Guadalcanal]] took place: Learning that the Japanese were trying to reinforce their troops for an attack on Henderson field, U.S. forces launched aircraft and warship to prevent the Japanese ground troops from reaching Guadalcanal, the U.S. succeeded thus turning back Japan's last major attempt to dislodge Allied forces from Guadalcanal. A small US naval force attempted to surprise and destroy the Japanese Navy were attempting to deliver supplies to their forces on Guadalcanal at [[Battle of Tassafaronga]] however it wasn't successful. The final naval battle took place between 29\u201330 January 1943, known as the [[Battle of Rennell Island]], US naval forces attempted to stop the Japanese Navy evacuating its ground forces from Guadalcanal, however the Japanese successfully forced the US Navy to withdraw, protecting the Japanese evacuation.<ref>Richard Overy, ''War in the Pacific'' (2010)</ref>\n\n====Tarawa====\n{{Main|Battle of Tarawa}}\n\nGuadalcanal made it clear to the Americans that the Japanese would fight to the bitter end. After brutal fighting in which few prisoners were taken on either side, the United States and the Allies pressed on the offensive. The landings at Tarawa on 20 November 1943, by the Americans became bogged down as armor attempting to break through the Japanese lines of defense either sank, were disabled or took on too much water to be of use. The Americans were eventually able to land a limited number of tanks and drive inland. After days of fighting they took control of Tarawa on 23 November. Of the original 2,600 Japanese soldiers on the island, only 17 were still alive.\n\n====Operations in Central Pacific====\n[[File:Halsey.JPG|thumb|215px|Admiral [[William F. Halsey]] \u2013 Commander U.S. Third Fleet at Leyte Gulf]]\n\nIn preparation of the recapture of the Philippines, the Allies started the [[Gilbert and Marshall Islands campaign]] to retake the Gilbert and Marshall Islands from the Japanese in summer 1943. Moving closer to Japan, the U.S. Navy decisively won the [[Battle of the Philippine Sea]] and landing forces captured the [[Mariana and Palau Islands campaign|Mariana and Palau Islands]] in summer 1944. The goal was building airbases within range of the new B-29 bomber aimed at Japan's industrial cities.\n\n====Liberation of the Philippines====\n{{Main|Battle of Leyte Gulf|Philippines Campaign (1944\u201345)}}\n\nThe [[Battle of Leyte Gulf]] in  23\u201326 October 1944, was a decisive American victory that sank virtually the entire remaining Japanese fleet in arguably the [[largest naval battle in history]]. Although the Japanese came surprisingly close to inflicting a major defeat on the Americans, at the last minute the Japanese panicked and lost. The battle was a complex overlapping series of engagements fought off the Philippine island of Leyte, which the U.S. Army had just invaded. The army forces were highly vulnerable to naval attack, and the Japanese goal was to inflict massive destruction. Two American fleets were involved, the Seventh and Third, but they were independent and did not communicate well so the Japanese with a trick maneuver slipped between the two American fleets and almost reached the beaches. However the Japanese communication system was even worse, and the Japanese army and navy did not cooperate, and the three Japanese fleets were each destroyed.<ref>C. Vann Woodward, ''The Battle for Leyte Gulf'' (1947)</ref>\n\nGeneral MacArthur fulfilled his promise to return to the Philippines by landing at Leyte on 20 October 1944. The grueling re-capture of the Philippines took place from 1944 to 1945 and included the battles of [[Battle of Leyte|Leyte]], [[Battle of Luzon|Luzon]], and [[Battle of Mindanao|Mindanao]].\n\n====Iwo Jima====\n[[File:Ronson flame tank Iwo Jima.jpg|thumb|300px|An [[M4 Sherman|M4 Sherman tank]] equipped with a flamethrower clearing a Japanese bunker on Iwo Jima, March 1945.]]\n\n{{Main|Battle of Iwo Jima}}\nThe Americans did not bypass the small island of Iwo Jima because it wanted bases for fighter escorts; it was actually used as an emergency landing base for B-29s. The Japanese knew they could not win, but they devised a strategy to maximize American casualties. Learning from the [[Battle of Saipan]] they prepared many fortified positions on the island, including [[Bunker|pillboxes]] and tunnels. The Marines attack began on 19 February 1945. Initially the Japanese put up no resistance, letting the Americans mass, creating more targets before the Americans took intense fire from [[Mount Suribachi]] and fought throughout the night until the hill was surrounded. Over the next 36 days, the Japanese were pressed into an ever-shrinking pocket, but they chose to fight on to the end, leaving only 1,000 of the original 21,000 defenders alive. The Marines suffered as well, suffering 25,000 casualties. The battle became iconic in America as the epitome of heroism in desperate hand-to-hand combat.<ref>Joseph H. Alexander, ''Closing In: Marines in the Seizure of Iwo Jima'' (1994), short Marine Corps history [http://ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USMC/USMC-C-Iwo/index.html online edition]</ref>\n\n====Okinawa====\n{{Main|Battle of Okinawa}}\n[[Okinawa]] became the last major battle of the Pacific Theater and the Second World War. The island was to become a staging area for the eventual [[Operation Downfall|invasion of Japan]] since it was just 350 miles (550&nbsp;km) south of the [[Mainland Japan|Japanese mainland]]. Marines and soldiers landed unopposed on 1 April 1945, to begin an 82-day campaign which became the largest land-sea-air battle in history and was noted for the ferocity of the fighting and the high civilian casualties with over 150,000 Okinawans losing their lives. Japanese [[kamikaze]] pilots caused the largest loss of ships in U.S. naval history with the sinking of 38 and the damaging of another 368. Total U.S. casualties were over 12,500 dead and 38,000 wounded, while the Japanese lost over 110,000 soldiers and 150,000 civilians. The fierce combat and high American losses led the Army and the Navy to oppose an invasion of the main islands. An alternative strategy was chosen: using the [[atomic bomb]] to induce surrender.<ref>William L. O'Neill, ''The Oxford Essential Guide to World War II'' (2002) p 279</ref>\n\n====Strategic Bombing of Japan====\n[[File:39th Bombardment Group B-29 Superfortress.jpg|thumb|B-29 Superfortress dropping 500 pound high-explosive bombs over Japan, 1945.]]\n{{main|Air raids on Japan}}\nThe flammability of Japan's large cities, and the concentration of munitions production there, made strategic bombing the favorite strategy of the Americans from 1941 onward. The first efforts were made from bases in China, where massive efforts to establish B-29 bases there and supply them over the Hump (the Himalayas) failed in 1944; the Japanese Army simply moved overland and captured the bases. [[Saipan]] and [[Tinian]], captured by the U.S. in June 1944, gave secure bases for the very-long-range B-29. The [[Boeing B-29 Superfortress]] boasted four 2,200 horsepower Wright R-3350 supercharged engines that could lift four tons of bombs 33,000 feet (high above Japanese flak or fighters), and make 3,500 mile round trips. However, the systematic raids that began in June 1944, were unsatisfactory, because the AAF had learned too much in Europe; it overemphasized self-defense. Arnold, in personal charge of the campaign (bypassing the theater commanders) brought in a new leader, brilliant, indefatigable, hard-charging General [[Curtis LeMay]]. In early 1945, LeMay ordered a radical change in tactics: remove the machine guns and gunners, fly in low at night. (Much fuel was used to get to 30,000 feet; it could now be replaced with more bombs.) The Japanese radar, fighter, and anti-aircraft systems were so ineffective that they could not hit the bombers. Fires raged through the cities, and millions of civilians fled to the mountains.<ref>John Olsen, ''A History of Air Warfare'' (2009) p 74</ref>\n\nTokyo was hit repeatedly, and during [[Operation Meetinghouse|the first massive fire raid of March 9\u201310, 1945]] suffered a conflagration of about 16 square miles (41&nbsp;km\u00b2) in area, that killed at least 83,000. On 5 June, 51,000 buildings in four miles of Kobe were burned out by 473 B-29s; the Japanese were learning to fight back, as 11 B-29s went down and 176 were damaged.<ref>Donald L.

Moreover, owing to the rising fear of air attacks, workers in general were reluctant to work in the factories, and the attendance fluctuated as much as 50 percent.\n\nThe Japanese army, which was not based in the cities, was largely undamaged by the raids. The Army was short of food and gasoline, but, as Iwo Jima and Okinawa proved, it was capable of ferocious resistance. The Japanese also had a new tactic that it hoped would provide the bargaining power to get a satisfactory peace, the Kamikaze.\n\n====Kamikaze====\nIn late 1944 the Japanese invented an unexpected and highly effective new tactic, the [[Kamikaze]] suicide plane aimed like a guided missile at American ships. The attacks began in October 1944 and continued to the end of the war. Experienced pilots were used to lead a mission because they could navigate; they were not Kamikazes, and they returned to base for another mission. The Kamikaze pilots were inexperienced and had minimal training; however most were well educated and intensely committed to the Emperor.<ref>Syohgo Hattori, \"Kamikaze: Japan's Glorious Failure.\" ''Air Power History'' 1996 43(1): 14\u201327. {{ISSN|1044-016X}}</ref><ref>Rikihei Inoguchi and Tadashi Nakajima, ''The Divine Wind: Japan's Kamikaze Force in World War II'' (1994)</ref>\n[[File:D4Y Yoshinori Yamaguchi col.jpg|thumb|A \"Judy\" in a suicide dive against {{USS|Essex|CV-9|6}}.

Rielly, ''Kamikazes, Corsairs, and Picket Ships: Okinawa, 1945'' (2010)</ref> Task Force 58 analyzed the Japanese technique at Okinawa in April 1945:\n:\"Rarely have the enemy attacks been so cleverly executed and made with such reckless determination. These attacks were generally by single or few aircraft making their approaches with radical changes in course and altitude, dispersing when intercepted and using cloud cover to every advantage. They tailed our friendlies home, used decoy planes, and came in at any altitude or on the water.\"<ref>quoted in Norman Friedman, ''U.S. naval weapons: every gun, missile, mine, and torpedo used by the U.S. Navy from 1883 to the present day'' (1982) p 93</ref>\n\nThe Americans decided the best defense against Kamikazes was to knock them out on the ground, or else in the air long before they approached the fleet. The Navy called for more fighters, and more warning, which meant combat air patrols circling the big ships, more radar picket ships (which themselves became prime targets), and more attacks on airbases and gasoline supplies. Japan suspended Kamikaze attacks in May 1945, because it was now hoarding gasoline and hiding planes in preparation for new suicide attacks if the Allies dared to invade their home islands. The Kamikaze strategy allowed the use of untrained pilots and obsolete planes, and since evasive maneuvering was dropped and there was no return trip, the scarce gasoline reserves could be stretched further. Since pilots guided their airplane like a guided missile all the way to the target, the proportion of hits was much higher than in ordinary bombing. Japan's industry was manufacturing 1,500 new planes a month in 1945. However, the quality of construction was very poor, and many new planes crashed during training or before reaching targets.\n\nExpecting increased resistance, including far more Kamikaze attacks once the main islands of Japan were invaded, the U.S. high command rethought its strategy and used atomic bombs to end the war, hoping it would make a costly invasion unnecessary.<ref>John Ray Skates, ''The invasion of Japan: alternative to the bomb'' (2000) p. 241</ref>\n\n====U.S. submarines in the Pacific====\n{{main|Allied submarines in the Pacific War}}\n[[File:Japanese Patrol Boat No.39 sinking after being torpedoed on 23 April 1943.jpg|thumb|A Japanese escort vessel sinking after being torpedoed by the {{USS|Seawolf|SS-197|6}}, 23 April 1943.]]\n\nU.S. submarines participated in the majority of naval battles in the Pacific theater, but the submarines were most decisive in their blockade of Japan, for which Japan was dependent on its sea transport to provide resources for its war effort.\n\nOn the afternoon of 7 December 1941, six hours after the Japanese attack, U.S. naval commanders in the Pacific were ordered by the U.S. Navy Chief of Staff to \"execute unrestricted air and submarine warfare against Japan\".<ref>Spector (1984), pp.478\u2013479; Blair, ''Silent Victory'', p.106; Holwitt, Joel I.

This included reconnaissance U.S. submarines landed and supplied guerillas in Japanese occupied territory and carrying in commandos for missions such as the [[Makin Island raid]], they also rescued crews of aircraft which had been forced down over the ocean.\n\nAs a result of several key improvements in strategy and tactics, from 1943, Allied submarines waged a more effective campaign against Japanese merchant shipping and the IJN, in effect strangling the Japanese Empire of resources. By the end of the war in August 1945, U.S. Navy submarines sank around 1300 Japanese merchant ships, as well as roughly 200 warships.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.2worldwar2.com/submarines.htm|title=World War 2 Submarines|publisher=}}</ref> Only 42 U.S. submarines were sunk in the Pacific,<ref name=pigboats>Roscoe, Theodore.

A fear in the American high command was that an invasion of mainland Japan would lead to enormous losses on the part of the Allies, as casualty estimates for the planned Operation Downfall demonstrate. As Japan was able to withstand the devastating incendiary raids and the naval blockade despite hundreds of thousands of civilian deaths, President Harry Truman gave the order to [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|drop the only two available atomic bombs]], hoping that such sheer force of destruction on a city would break Japanese resolve and end the war. The first bomb was dropped on an industrial city, [[Hiroshima]], on 6 August 1945, killing appropriately 70,000 people. A second bomb was dropped on another industrial city, [[Nagasaki]], on 9 August after it appeared that the Japanese high command was not planning to surrender, killing approximately 35,000 people. Fearing additional atomic attacks, [[Surrender of Japan|Japan surrendered]] on 15 August 1945.\n\n[[Victory over Japan Day|V-J Day]] which occurred on 15 August 1945 marked the end of the United States' war with the Empire of Japan. Since Japan was the last remaining Axis Power, V-J Day also marked the end of World War II.\n\n==Minor American front==\n{{Main|China Burma India Theater}}\n\nThe United States contributed several forces to the China Burma India theater, such as the 5307th Composite Unit (Provisional) but nicknamed \"[[Merrill's Marauders]]\" after its commander; [[Frank Merrill]], it  was a United States Army [[long range penetration]] [[special operations]] [[jungle warfare]] unit organized as light infantry assault units. In slightly more than five months of combat in 1944, the Marauders advanced 750 miles through some of the harshest jungle terrain in the world, fought in five major engagements, mostly behind enemy lines, with or in support of British Empire and Chinese forces in [[Burma Campaign|Burma]] and suffered many casualties. On 10 August 1944 the Marauders were consolidated into the 475th Infantry. The U.S. also had an adviser to [[Chiang Kai-shek]] and [[Joseph Stillwell]]. Units of the [[Tenth Air Force]], [[Fourteenth Air Force]], and [[Twentieth Air Force]] of the USAAF also served in the theatre, including the previously mentioned \"Flying Tigers\".\n\n==Attacks on U.S. soil==\n{{main|American Theater (World War II)}}\nAlthough the [[Axis powers]] never launched a full-scale [[invasion of the United States]], there were attacks and acts of sabotage on U.S. soil.\n* January\u2013August 1942 \u2013 [[Second Happy Time]], German U-Boats engaged American ships off the U.S. East Coast.\n* February 23, 1942 \u2013 [[Bombardment of Ellwood]], a Japanese submarine attack on California.\n* March 4, 1942 \u2013 [[Operation K]], a Japanese reconnaissance over Pearl Harbor following the attack on December 7, 1941. \n* June 3, 1942 \u2013 August 15, 1943 \u2013 [[Aleutian Islands Campaign]], the battle for the then incorporated territory of Alaska.\n* June 21\u201322, 1942 \u2013 [[Bombardment of Fort Stevens]], the second attack on a U.S. military base in the continental U.S. in World War II.\n* September 9, 1942, and September 29, 1942 \u2013 [[Lookout Air Raids]], the only attack by enemy aircraft on the U.S. mainland and the second enemy aircraft attack on the U.S. continent in World War II.\n* November 1944\u2013April 1945 \u2013 [[Fu-Go balloon bomb]]s, over 9,300 of them were launched by Japan across the Pacific Ocean towards the U.S. mainland to start forest fires.

He enlisted in the [[13th Iowa Volunteer Infantry Regiment]] on September 17, 1861, and was appointed a [[corporal]] in Company F the following month. Following the [[Battle of Shiloh]], in which he was wounded, he was promoted to [[sergeant]], and later participated in the battles of [[Second Battle of Corinth|Corinth]], [[Battle of Jackson, Mississippi|Jackson]] and [[Battle of Meridian|Meridian]] in [[Mississippi]]. He reenlisted on January 1, 1864, and was made a [[first sergeant]], and campaigned in [[Atlanta Campaign|Georgia]] and the [[Carolinas Campaign|Carolinas]] in 1864-65. Wood mustered out at [[Louisville, Kentucky]], on July 21, 1865, as [[second lieutenant]] of Company F.<ref name=\"heit\">Heitman (1903), p. 1054</ref>\n\n===Regular Army===\nWood entered the [[United States Military Academy]] at [[West Point, New York]], on July 1, 1868, graduating 14th in order of merit in a class of 57 on June 14, 1872.<ref name =\"cullum3\">Cullum (1891), pp. 189-190</ref>\n\nHe was appointed a second lieutenant of the [[4th Cavalry Regiment (United States)|4th Cavalry]] and sent west to serve on the [[Texas]] frontier between 1872 and 1875.  He was posted successively at [[Fort Richardson, Texas|Fort Richardson]] (September 24 to December 21, 1872), [[Fort Concho]] (January 4 to May 23, 1873), [[Fort Clark, Texas|Fort Clark]] (June 8, 1873, to August 6, 1874), and at Fort Richardson again until March 14, 1875. While at Fort Clark, he participated with the 4th Cavalry on extended campaigning in the field between June 1873 and May 1874 seeking to stop [[Kickapoo people|Kickapoo]] and [[Apache]] incursions into Texas from Mexico. In August and December 1874, during the [[Red River War|expedition to subdue the Southern Plains tribes]], Wood's company was with a battalion that repelled an attack on their camp on September 26 by [[Comanche]] Indians at Tule Canyon on the [[Staked Plain]]. Following the successful conclusion of the campaign at the [[Battle of Palo Duro Canyon]] two days later, Wood was with his company stationed at [[Fort Sill]]; the Cheyenne Agency, [[Dakota Territory]]; and [[Fort Reno (Oklahoma)|Fort Reno]] until October 11, 1876.<ref name=\"cullum3\"/>\n\nOn October 18, 1876, Wood was assigned to the faculty at West Point as Assistant Instructor of Cavalry Tactics, where he was promoted to [[first lieutenant]] on November 25, 1876.<ref name=\"cullum3\"/>\n\nIn August 1878 he returned to Fort Reno shortly before the break-out resulting in the [[Northern Cheyenne Exodus]].<ref name=\"cullum3\"/> Wood was assigned command of a small detachment of Company G, 4th Cavalry and marched north to join the pursuit. His detachment of 20 troopers joined a mixed force of soldiers and cowboys searching for the Cheyenne. On September 21, 1878, at Little Sandy Creek near present-day [[Ashland, Kansas]], Wood led his company in a mounted charge to rescue two wounded cowboys ambushed and trapped in a small canyon.<ref>Maddux (2003), pp. 68-72</ref> His company became part of a mixed command of cavalry and infantry under Lieut. Col. William Lewis of the [[19th Infantry Regiment (United States)|19th Infantry]] that pursued and caught the Cheyenne in another canyon at Punished Woman's Fork, near present-day [[Scott City, Kansas|Scott City]]. Lewis attacked on the late afternoon of September 27, 1878, using dismounted cavalry including Wood's company in skirmish lines, and temporarily succeeded in pinning down the Cheyenne in the canyon. Lewis was mortally wounded by a sharpshooter during the engagement and the Cheyenne escaped after dark.<ref>Maddux (2003), pp. 86-93</ref> For these engagements Wood was [[Brevet (military)|brevet]]ted for gallantry in action in 1891.\n\nHe returned with the detachment to Fort Reno in December 1878 and served with Company G until June 28, 1879. From July 9, 1879, to February 1, 1880, Wood served as regimental quartermaster at Fort Clark. The regiment relocated to [[Fort Garland]], [[Colorado]], in October 1879 in response to the \"[[Meeker Massacre]]\" bu [[Ute people|Ute]] Indians, and in March 1880 returned to Fort Reno. In May, 1881, Wood's company was part of an expedition that moved the Uncompaghre Utes to the new [[Uintah and Ouray Indian Reservation|Ouray Agency]] in [[Utah]], and then continued to Arizona to quell an outbreak of hostilities with Apaches, before being posted to [[Fort Stanton]], [[New Mexico]], on November 17. He remained there until March 10, 1883, when he went on leave of absence.<ref name=\"cullum3\"/>\n\nFor the next ten months Wood traveled to Europe, where he observed maneuvers of the French Army, and was promoted to [[captain (United States)|captain]] on June 30, 1883, while in France.  He returned to Fort Stanton on January 22, 1884. In May his troop marched to [[Fort Huachuca]], [[Arizona]], where Wood served as post commander and operated in the field against the [[Chiricahua Apache]]s. On July 31, 1886, he was posted to [[Fort Bowie]], Arizona, with frequent duty in the field, until September 29, 1887. His troop returned to Fort Huachuca, where it was stationed until May 1890, with Wood taking extended leave for illness for four months in 1888.<ref name=\"cullum3\"/> In the autumn of 1889 the entire regiment assembled at [[Fort Grant]] for a camp of instruction and field maneuvers.<ref name=\"rod\">Rodenbough (1890), pp. 216-219</ref>\n\nIn May 1890 Wood's battalion of the 4th Cavalry transferred to the Department of California, stationed at the [[Presidio of San Francisco]].<ref name=\"rod\"/><ref name=\"cullum4\">Cullum (1900), p. 218</ref>\n\n==Yosemite National Park==\nOn October 1, 1890, President [[Benjamin Harrison]] signed into law the legislation creating [[Yosemite National Park]]. The act did not provide for management or protection of the park from trespassers, in particular game poachers and lumbermen. However a precedent for detailing Army troops to meet these concerns had been established when Congress had authorized the use of troops to protect [[Yellowstone National Park]] in 1883. [[United States Secretary of the Interior]] [[John W. Noble]] requested Harrison to provide troops \"to prevent timber cutting, sheep herding, trespassing, or spoliation in particular.\"<ref name=\"hamp\"/> On April 6, 1891, the commanding general of the Department of California detailed Troop I, 4th Cavalry to protect the park.<ref name=\"smith\">{{cite web | last =Smith| first =David A.| authorlink = | year =2009 | url= http://www.militarymuseum.org/YosemiteCavalry.html | title = Yosemite: The Cavalry Years| work =  | publisher = The California State Military Museum | accessdate=3 January 2013  | ref = }}</ref>\n\nThe nature of Yosemite meant that the duties and problems of the 4th Cavalry would be different from those encountered in Yellowstone. Big game animals were not present in numbers to attract poachers, nor were there geysers or other fragile formations that careless tourists might \"spoil\". Yosemite's ancient forests were threatened, however, and game could thrive if the area was protected. The boundaries of the Parks were not marked, and roads into and through the park were virtually nonexistent.<ref name=\"hamp\"/> Wood marched the troop 250 miles from the Presidio to Yosemite and arrived May 19, 1891, becoming the first Acting Superintendent of Yosemite National Park.<ref name=\"shaf\">Schaffer (1999), p. 50</ref> He established Camp Wawona at the southern edge of the park a mile west of [[Wawona, California]], which was to be used between May and October each year by troops patrolling the park to prevent trespassing by commercial interests (primarily timber cutters), game poachers, and stockmen, particularly sheepherders.<ref name=\"smith\"/>\n\nAfter posting notices, Wood arrested and evicted trespassers from the park, but this tactic largely failed to deter sheepherders when the [[United States Attorney for the Northern District of California]] publicly declared that he would not prosecute violators. Wood's company was detailed to Camp Wawona in both 1892 and 1893, and during these seasons he altered his tactics to those which had proved effective in Yellowstone. Wood's troops arrested the sheepherders to separate them from their flocks, evicting them and dispersing their herds outside park boundaries on the opposite side of the park. The process of recovering their dispersed herds was time-consuming and uneconomical to the trespassers, and the problem of [[overgrazing]] in the park was brought under control until the sheepherders devised counter tactics after 1895.<ref name=\"hamp\">{{cite book | first = H.

E. Wood in his honor by Captain George H. G. Gale (USMA 1879) of the 4th Cavalry, who succeeded Wood as Acting Superintendent, and remained as park headquarters until 1906, when the Yosemite Valley was re-ceded to the U.S. government and the camp moved there. Mount Wood (12,657&nbsp;ft), just outside the park in [[Mono County, California]], was named in his honor in 1894 by Lieutenant Nathaniel F. McClure (USMA 1887), also of the 4th Cavalry.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n*{{cite book| first =George W. | last =Cullum | chapter = | title = Biographical Register of the Officers and Graduates of the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York| editor = | year = 1891| publisher = USMA Digital Library| place = [[West Point, New York]]| isbn = | oclc = | url = | pages =}} Volume III\n*{{cite book| first =George W. | last =Cullum | chapter = | title = Biographical Register of the Officers and Graduates of the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York| editor = | year = 1900| publisher = USMA Digital Library| place = [[West Point, New York]]| isbn = | oclc = | url = | pages =}} Volume IV\n*{{cite book | first = H.

He enlisted in the [[13th Iowa Volunteer Infantry Regiment]] on September 17, 1861, and was appointed a [[corporal]] in Company F the following month. Following the [[Battle of Shiloh]], in which he was wounded, he was promoted to [[sergeant]], and later participated in the battles of [[Second Battle of Corinth|Corinth]], [[Battle of Jackson, Mississippi|Jackson]] and [[Battle of Meridian|Meridian]] in [[Mississippi]]. He reenlisted on January 1, 1864, and was made a [[first sergeant]], and campaigned in [[Atlanta Campaign|Georgia]] and the [[Carolinas Campaign|Carolinas]] in 1864-65. Wood mustered out at [[Louisville, Kentucky]], on July 21, 1865, as [[second lieutenant]] of Company F.<ref name=\"heit\">Heitman (1903), p. 1054</ref>\n\n===Regular Army===\nWood entered the [[United States Military Academy]] at [[West Point, New York]], on July 1, 1868, graduating 14th in order of merit in a class of 57 on June 14, 1872.<ref name =\"cullum3\">Cullum (1891), pp. 189-190</ref>\n\nHe was appointed a second lieutenant of the [[4th Cavalry Regiment (United States)|4th Cavalry]] and sent west to serve on the [[Texas]] frontier between 1872 and 1875.  He was posted successively at [[Fort Richardson, Texas|Fort Richardson]] (September 24 to December 21, 1872), [[Fort Concho]] (January 4 to May 23, 1873), [[Fort Clark, Texas|Fort Clark]] (June 8, 1873, to August 6, 1874), and at Fort Richardson again until March 14, 1875. While at Fort Clark, he was participated with the 4th Cavalry on extended campaigning in the field between June 1873 and May 1874 seeking to stop [[Kickapoo people|Kickapoo]] and [[Apache]] incursions into Texas from Mexico. In August and December 1874, during the [[Red River War|expedition to subdue the Southern Plains tribes]], Wood's company was with a battalion that repelled an attack on their camp on September 26 by [[Comanche]] Indians at Tule Canyon on the [[Staked Plain]]. Following the successful conclusion of the campaign at the [[Battle of Palo Duro Canyon]] two days later, Wood was with his company stationed at [[Fort Sill]]; the Cheyenne Agency, [[Dakota Territory]]; and [[Fort Reno (Oklahoma)|Fort Reno]] until October 11, 1876.<ref name=\"cullum3\"/>\n\nOn October 18, 1876, Wood was assigned to the faculty at West Point as Assistant Instructor of Cavalry Tactics, where he was promoted to [[first lieutenant]] on November 25, 1876.<ref name=\"cullum3\"/>\n\nIn August 1878 he returned to Fort Reno shortly before the break-out resulting in the [[Northern Cheyenne Exodus]].<ref name=\"cullum3\"/> Wood was assigned command of a small detachment of Company G, 4th Cavalry and marched north to join the pursuit. His detachment of 20 troopers joined a mixed force of soldiers and cowboys searching for the Cheyenne. On September 21, 1878, at Little Sandy Creek near present-day [[Ashland, Kansas]], Wood led his company in a mounted charge to rescue two wounded cowboys ambushed and trapped in a small canyon.<ref>Maddux (2003), pp. 68-72</ref> His company became part of a mixed command of cavalry and infantry under Lieut. Col. William Lewis of the [[19th Infantry Regiment (United States)|19th Infantry]] that pursued and caught the Cheyenne in another canyon at Punished Woman's Fork, near present-day [[Scott City, Kansas|Scott City]]. Lewis attacked on the late afternoon of September 27, 1878, using dismounted cavalry including Wood's company in skirmish lines, and temporarily succeeded in pinning down the Cheyenne in the canyon. Lewis was mortally wounded by a sharpshooter during the engagement and the Cheyenne escaped after dark.<ref>Maddux (2003), pp. 86-93</ref> For these engagements Wood was [[Brevet (military)|brevet]]ted for gallantry in action in 1891.\n\nHe returned with the detachment to Fort Reno in December 1878 and served with Company G until June 28, 1879. From July 9, 1879, to February 1, 1880, Wood served as regimental quartermaster at Fort Clark. The regiment relocated to [[Fort Garland]], [[Colorado]], in October 1879 in response to the \"[[Meeker Massacre]]\" bu [[Ute people|Ute]] Indians, and in March 1880 returned to Fort Reno. In May, 1881, Wood's company was part of an expedition that moved the Uncompaghre Utes to the new [[Uintah and Ouray Indian Reservation|Ouray Agency]] in [[Utah]], and then continued to Arizona to quell an outbreak of hostilities with Apaches, before being posted to [[Fort Stanton]], [[New Mexico]], on November 17. He remained there until March 10, 1883, when he went on leave of absence.<ref name=\"cullum3\"/>\n\nFor the next ten months Wood traveled to Europe, where he observed maneuvers of the French Army, and was promoted to [[captain (United States)|captain]] on June 30, 1883, while in France.  He returned to Fort Stanton on January 22, 1884. In May his troop marched to [[Fort Huachuca]], [[Arizona]], where Wood served as post commander and operated in the field against the [[Chiricahua Apache]]s. On July 31, 1886, he was posted to [[Fort Bowie]], Arizona, with frequent duty in the field, until September 29, 1887. His troop returned to Fort Huachuca, where it was stationed until May 1890, with Wood taking extended leave for illness for four months in 1888.<ref name=\"cullum3\"/> In the autumn of 1889 the entire regiment assembled at [[Fort Grant]] for a camp of instruction and field maneuvers.<ref name=\"rod\">Rodenbough (1890), pp. 216-219</ref>\n\nIn May 1890 Wood's battalion of the 4th Cavalry transferred to the Department of California, stationed at the [[Presidio of San Francisco]].<ref name=\"rod\"/><ref name=\"cullum4\">Cullum (1900), p. 218</ref>\n\n==Yosemite National Park==\nOn October 1, 1890, President [[Benjamin Harrison]] signed into law the legislation creating [[Yosemite National Park]]. The act did not provide for management or protection of the park from trespassers, in particular game poachers and lumbermen. However a precedent for detailing Army troops to meet these concerns had been established when Congress had authorized the use of troops to protect [[Yellowstone National Park]] in 1883. [[United States Secretary of the Interior]] [[John W. Noble]] requested Harrison to provide troops \"to prevent timber cutting, sheep herding, trespassing, or spoliation in particular.\"<ref name=\"hamp\"/> On April 6, 1891, the commanding general of the Department of California detailed Troop I, 4th Cavalry to protect the park.<ref name=\"smith\">{{cite web | last =Smith| first =David A.| authorlink = | year =2009 | url= http://www.militarymuseum.org/YosemiteCavalry.html | title = Yosemite: The Cavalry Years| work =  | publisher = The California State Military Museum | accessdate=3 January 2013  | ref = }}</ref>\n\nThe nature of Yosemite meant that the duties and problems of the 4th Cavalry would be different from those encountered in Yellowstone. Big game animals were not present in numbers to attract poachers, nor were there geysers or other fragile formations that careless tourists might \"spoil\". Yosemite's ancient forests were threatened, however, and game could thrive if the area was protected. The boundaries of the Parks were not marked, and roads into and through the park were virtually nonexistent.<ref name=\"hamp\"/> Wood marched the troop 250 miles from the Presidio to Yosemite and arrived May 19, 1891, becoming the first Acting Superintendent of Yosemite National Park.<ref name=\"shaf\">Schaffer (1999), p. 50</ref> He established Camp Wawona at the southern edge of the park a mile west of [[Wawona, California]], which was to be used between May and October each year by troops patrolling the park to prevent trespassing by commercial interests (primarily timber cutters), game poachers, and stockmen, particularly sheepherders.<ref name=\"smith\"/>\n\nAfter posting notices, Wood arrested and evicted trespassers from the park, but this tactic largely failed to deter sheepherders when the [[United States Attorney for the Northern District of California]] publicly declared that he would not prosecute violators. Wood's company was detailed to Camp Wawona in both 1892 and 1893, and during these seasons he altered his tactics to those which had proved effective in Yellowstone. Wood's troops arrested the sheepherders to separate them from their flocks, evicting them and dispersing their herds outside park boundaries on the opposite side of the park. The process of recovering their dispersed herds was time-consuming and uneconomical to the trespassers, and the problem of [[overgrazing]] in the park was brought under control until the sheepherders devised counter tactics after 1895.<ref name=\"hamp\">{{cite book | first = H.

Gale (USMA 1879) of the 4th Cavalry, who succeeded Wood as Acting Superintendent, and remained as park headquarters until 1906, when the Yosemite Valley was re-ceded to the U.S. government and the camp moved there. Mount Wood (12,657&nbsp;ft), just outside the park in [[Mono County, California]], was named in his honor in 1894 by Lieutenant Nathaniel F.

Recently, many new lines of evidence have been brought to bear on dinosaur [[physiology]] generally, including not only metabolic systems and thermoregulation, but on respiratory and cardiovascular systems as well.\n\nDuring the early years of dinosaur paleontology, it was widely considered that they were sluggish, cumbersome, and sprawling [[Poikilotherm|cold-blooded]] [[lizard]]s. However, with the discovery of much more complete skeletons in western United States, starting in the 1870s, scientists could make more informed interpretations of dinosaur biology and physiology.  [[Edward Drinker Cope]], opponent of [[Othniel Charles Marsh]] in the [[Bone Wars]], propounded at least some dinosaurs as active and agile, as seen in the painting of two fighting \"[[Dryptosaurus|Laelaps]]\" produced under his direction by [[Charles R.

These features include:\n* Jaws that only slightly opened and closed so that all the teeth met at the same time\n* Large abdomens that could accommodate large amounts of vegetation and store it for the long time it takes to digest vegetation\n* Guts that likely contained [[Endosymbiotic]] micro-organisms that digest [[cellulose]], as no known animal can digest this tough material directly<ref name=\"Norman2001DinosaurFeeding\" />\n\n[[Sauropod]]s, which were herbivores, did not chew their food, as their teeth and jaws appear suitable only for stripping leaves off plants. [[Ornithischian]]s, also herbivores, show a variety of approaches. The armored [[ankylosaur]]s and [[stegosaur]]s had small heads and weak jaws and teeth, and are thought to have fed in much the same way as sauropods. The [[pachycephalosaur]]s had small heads and weak jaws and teeth, but their lack of large digestive systems suggests a different diet, possibly fruits, seeds, or young shoots, which would have been more nutritious to them than leaves.<ref name=\"Norman2001DinosaurFeeding\" />\n\nOn the other hand, [[ornithopod]]s such as ''[[Hypsilophodon]]'', ''[[Iguanodon]]'' and various [[hadrosaur]]s had horny beaks for snipping off vegetation and jaws and teeth that were well-adapted for chewing. The horned [[ceratopsian]]s had similar mechanisms.<ref name=\"Norman2001DinosaurFeeding\" />\n\nIt has often been suggested that at least some dinosaurs used swallowed stones, known as [[gastrolith]]s, to aid digestion by grinding their food in muscular [[gizzard]]s, and that this was a feature they shared with birds. In 2007 Oliver Wings reviewed references to gastroliths in scientific literature and found considerable confusion, starting with the lack of an agreed and objective definition of \"gastrolith\". He found that swallowed hard stones or grit can assist digestion in birds that mainly feed on grain but may not be essential\u2014and that birds that eat insects in summer and grain in winter usually get rid of the stones and grit in summer. Gastroliths have often been described as important for [[sauropod]] dinosaurs, whose diet of vegetation required very thorough digestion, but Wings concluded that this idea was incorrect: gastroliths are found with only a small percentage of sauropod fossils; where they have been found, the amounts are too small and in many cases the stones are too soft to have been effective in grinding food; most of these gastroliths are highly polished, but gastroliths used by modern animals to grind food are roughened by wear and corroded by stomach acids; hence the sauropod gastroliths were probably swallowed accidentally. On the other hand, he concluded that gastroliths found with fossils of advanced [[theropod]] dinosaurs such as ''[[Sinornithomimus]]'' and ''[[Caudipteryx]]'' resemble those of birds, and that the use of gastroliths for grinding food may have appeared early in the group of dinosaurs from which these dinosaurs and birds both evolved.<ref name=\"Wings2007ReviewOfGastrolithFunction\">{{cite journal\n| author=Wings, O. | year=2007\n| title=A review of gastrolith function with implications for fossil vertebrates and a revised classification\n| journal=Acta Palaeontologica Polonica | volume=52 | issue=1 |pages=1\u201316\n| url=http://app.pan.pl/archive/published/app52/app52-001.pdf | accessdate=2008-09-10\n}}</ref><ref name=\"WingsSander2007NoGastricMillInSauropods\">{{cite journal\n|author1=Wings, O. |author2=Sander.

But this does not imply that ornithischians could not have had metabolic rates comparable to those of mammals, since mammals also do not have air sacs.<ref name=\"ReidInFarlowBrettSurman1997\" />\n\nThree explanations have been suggested for the development of air sacs in dinosaurs:<ref name=\"SerenoMartinezEtAl2008AvianIntrathoracicAirSacsInNewPredatoryDinosaur\" />\n* Increase in respiratory capacity. This is probably the most common hypothesis, and fits well with the idea that many dinosaurs had fairly high [[metabolic rate]]s.\n* Improving balance and maneuvrability by lowering the [[center of gravity]] and reducing [[rotational inertia]]. However this does not explain the expansion of air sacs in the quadrupedal sauropods.\n* As a cooling mechanism. It seems that air sacs and feathers evolved at about the same time in [[coelurosaur]]s. If feathers retained heat, their owners would have required a means of dissipating excess heat. This idea is plausible but needs further empirical support.\n\nCalculations of the volumes of various parts of the sauropod ''Apatosaurus''' respiratory system support the evidence of bird-like air sacs in sauropods:\n* Assuming that ''Apatosaurus'', like dinosaurs' nearest surviving relatives [[crocodilia]]ns and birds, did not have a [[Thoracic diaphragm|diaphragm]], the [[dead space (physiology)|dead-space volume]] of a 30-ton specimen would be about 184 liters. This is the total volume of the mouth, trachea and air tubes. If the animal exhales less than this, stale air is not expelled and is sucked back into the lungs on the following inhalation.\n* Estimates of its [[Lung volumes|tidal volume]]&nbsp;\u2013 the amount of air moved into or out of the lungs in a single breath&nbsp;\u2013 depend on the type of [[respiratory system]] the animal had: 904&nbsp;liters if avian; 225&nbsp;liters if mammalian; 19&nbsp;liters if reptilian.\nOn this basis, ''Apatosaurus'' could not have had a reptilian respiratory system, as its tidal volume would have been less than its dead-space volume, so that stale air was not expelled but was sucked back into the lungs. Likewise, a mammalian system would only provide to the lungs about 225&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;184&nbsp;=&nbsp;41&nbsp;liters of fresh, oxygenated air on each breath. ''Apatosaurus'' must therefore have had either a system unknown in the modern world or one like [[Bird anatomy#Respiratory system|birds]]', with multiple air sacs and a flow-through lung. Furthermore, an avian system would only need a lung volume of about 600&nbsp;liters while a mammalian one would have required about 2,950&nbsp;liters, which would exceed the estimated 1,700&nbsp;liters of space available in a 30-ton ''Apatosaurus''\u2032 chest.<ref name=\"PaladinoEtAlInFarlowBrettSurman1997\">{{Cite book |author=Paladino, F.V., Spotila, J.R., and Dodson, P. |year=1997 |contribution=A Blueprint for Giants: Modeling the Physiology of Large Dinosaurs |editor=Farlow, J.O. |editor2=Brett-Surman, M.K.  |title=The Complete Dinosaur |pages=491\u2013504 |isbn=978-0-253-21313-6 |publisher=Indiana University Press |location=Bloomington, Ind.}}</ref>\n\nDinosaur respiratory systems with bird-like air sacs may have been capable of sustaining higher activity levels than mammals of similar size and build can sustain.

All the dinosaurs they examined had nasal passages that were too narrow and short to accommodate nasal turbinates, so dinosaurs could not have sustained the breathing rate required for a mammal-like or bird-like metabolic rate while at rest, because their lungs would have dried out.<ref name=\"RubenJonesEtAl1997LungStructure\"/><ref name=\"RubenJonesEtAl1997LungStructure\"/><ref name=Ruben1998>{{cite journal |author=Ruben, J.A., Jones, T.D., Geist, N.R., Leitch, A., and Hillenius, W.J. |title=Lung ventilation and gas exchange in theropod dinosaurs |journal=Science |volume=278 |issue=5341 |pages=1267\u20131270 |doi=10.1126/science.278.5341.1267 |year=1997\n|bibcode = 1997Sci...278.1267R }}</ref><ref name=Ruben1996>{{cite journal |author=Ruben, J.A., Hillenius, W.J., Geist, N.R., Leitch, A., Jones, T.D., Currie, P.J., Horner, J.R., and Espe, G. |title=The metabolic status of some Late Cretaceous dinosaurs |journal=Science |date=August 1996 |volume=273 |issue=5279 |pages=1204\u20131207\n|doi=10.1126/science.273.5279.1204 |bibcode = 1996Sci...273.1204R }}</ref><ref name=\"RubenJones2000FurAndFeathers\">{{cite journal |author1=Ruben, J.A. |author2=Jones, T.D.  |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Selective Factors Associated with the Origin of Fur and Feathers |journal=American Zoologist |year=2000 |volume=40 |issue=4 |pages=585\u2013596 |doi=10.1093/icb/40.4.585 |url=http://icb.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/40/4/585|doi-access=free }}</ref> However, objections have been raised against this argument.

The activity of metabolic enzymes varies with temperature, so temperature control is vital for any organism, whether endothermic or ectothermic. Organisms can be categorized as [[poikilotherms]] (poikilo&nbsp;\u2013 changing), which are tolerant of internal temperature fluctuations, and [[homeotherms]] (homeo&nbsp;\u2013 same), which must maintain a constant core temperature. Animals can be further categorized as [[endotherms]], which regulate their temperature internally, and [[ectotherms]], which regulate temperature by the use of external heat sources.\n\n=== What the debate is about ===\n{{see also|Gigantothermy}}\n\"[[Warm-blooded]]ness\" is a complex and rather ambiguous term, because it includes some or all of:\n* '''[[Homeotherm]]y''', i.e. maintaining a fairly constant body temperature. Modern endotherms maintain a variety of temperatures: {{convert|28|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}} to {{convert|30|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}} in [[monotreme]]s and [[sloth]]s;  {{convert|33|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}} to {{convert|36|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}} in [[marsupial]]s;  {{convert|36|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}} to {{convert|38|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}} in most [[placental]]s; and around {{convert|41|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}} in birds.<ref name=\"ReidInFarlowBrettSurman1997\" />\n* '''[[Tachymetabolism]]''', i.e. maintaining a high [[metabolic rate]], particularly when at rest. This requires a fairly high and stable body temperature, since biochemical processes run about half as fast if an animal's temperature drops by 10C\u00b0; most [[enzyme]]s have an optimum [[operating temperature]] and their efficiency drops rapidly outside the preferred range.<ref name=\"McGowan11991DinosaursSpitfiresSeaDragonsP133To135\">{{cite book |author=McGowan, C. |title=Dinosaurs, Spitfires and Sea Dragons |year=1991 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/dinosaursspitfir00mcgo/page/133 133\u2013135] |publisher=Harvard University Press |isbn=978-0-674-20769-1 |url=https://archive.org/details/dinosaursspitfir00mcgo/page/133 }}</ref>\n* '''[[Endotherm]]y''', i.e. the ability to generate heat internally, for example by \"burning\" fat, rather than via behaviors such as basking or muscular activity. Although endothermy is in principle the most reliable way to maintain a fairly constant temperature, it is expensive; for example modern mammals need 10 to 13 times as much food as modern reptiles.<ref name=\"ReidInFarlowBrettSurman1997\" />\n\nLarge dinosaurs may also have maintained their temperatures by inertial homeothermy, also known as \"bulk homeothermy\" or \"mass homeothermy\". In other words, the [[thermal capacity]] of such large animals was so high that it would take two days or more for their temperatures to change significantly, and this would have smoothed out variations caused by daily temperature cycles. This smoothing effect has been observed in large turtles and [[crocodilian]]s, but ''[[Plateosaurus]]'', which weighed about {{convert|700|kg|lb}}, may have been the smallest dinosaur in which it would have been effective. Inertial homeothermy would not have been possible for small species nor for the young of larger species.<ref name=\"ReidInFarlowBrettSurman1997\" /> Vegetation fermenting in the guts of large herbivores can also produce considerable heat, but this method of maintaining a high and stable temperature would not have been possible for carnivores or for small herbivores or the young of larger herbivores.<ref>{{cite journal\n| author=Mackie, R.I.\n| title=Mutualistic Fermentative Digestion in the Gastrointestinal Tract: Diversity and Evolution\n| journal=Integrative and Comparative Biology | volume=42 | issue=2 | pages=319\u2013326 | year=2002\n| url=http://icb.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/42/2/319 | accessdate=2008-09-12\n| doi=10.1093/icb/42.2.319 | pmid=21708724\n| doi-access=free }}</ref>\n\nSince the internal mechanisms of extinct creatures are unknowable, most discussion focuses on homeothermy and tachymetabolism.\n\nAssessment of metabolic rates is complicated by the distinction between the rates while resting and while active. In all modern reptiles and most mammals and birds the maximum rates during all-out activity are 10 to 20 times higher than minimum rates while at rest. However, in a few mammals these rates differ by a factor of 70. Theoretically it would be possible for a land vertebrate to have a reptilian metabolic rate at rest and a bird-like rate while working flat out. However, an animal with such a low resting rate would be unable to grow quickly. The huge [[herbivorous]] [[sauropod]]s may have been on the move so constantly in search of food that their energy expenditure would have been much the same irrespective of whether their resting metabolic rates were high or low.<ref>{{Cite book\n| author=Paul, G.S. | chapter=Cope's rule | page=211\n| title=Morrison Symposium Proceedings: A Special Issue Of The Journal Modern Geology\n| editor=Carpenter, K. |editor2=Fraser, N. |editor3=Chure, D. |editor4=Kirkland, J.I.\n| publisher=Taylor & Francis | year=1998 | isbn=978-90-5699-183-8\n| chapter-url=https://books.google.com/?id=CLEPeg_SjTcC&dq=sprawling+limbs+efficient | accessdate=2008-09-12\n}}</ref>\n\n=== Metabolic options ===\nThe main possibilities are that:<ref name=\"ReidInFarlowBrettSurman1997\" />\n* Dinosaurs were cold-blooded, like modern reptiles, except that the large size of many would have stabilized their body temperatures.\n* They were warm-blooded, more like modern mammals or birds than modern reptiles.\n* They were neither cold-blooded nor warm-blooded in modern terms, but had metabolisms that were different from and in some ways intermediate between those of modern cold-blooded and warm-blooded animals.\n* They included animals with two or three of these types of metabolism.\n\nDinosaurs were around for about 150 million years, so it is very likely that different groups evolved different metabolisms and thermoregulatory regimes, and that some developed different physiologies from the first dinosaurs.\n\nIf all or some dinosaurs had intermediate metabolisms, they may have had the following features:<ref name=\"ReidInFarlowBrettSurman1997\" />\n* Low resting metabolic rates\u2014which would reduce the amount of food they needed and allow them to use more of that food for growth than do animals with high resting metabolic rates.\n* Inertial homeothermy\n* The ability to control heat loss by expanding and contracting blood vessels just under the skin, as many modern reptiles do.\n* Two-part circulations driven by four-chambered hearts.\n* High [[aerobic capacity]], allowing sustained activity.\nRobert Reid has suggested that such animals could be regarded as \"failed endotherms\". He envisaged both dinosaurs and the Triassic ancestors of mammals passing through a stage with these features. Mammals were forced to become smaller as [[archosaur]]s came to dominate [[ecological niche]]s for medium to large animals. Their decreasing size made them more vulnerable to heat loss because it increased their ratios of surface area to mass, and thus forced them to increase internal heat generation and thus become full endotherms. On the other hand, dinosaurs became medium to very large animals and thus were able to retain the \"intermediate\" type of metabolism.<ref name=\"ReidInFarlowBrettSurman1997\" />\n\n=== Bone structure ===\nArmand de Ricql\u00e8s discovered [[Haversian canals]] in dinosaur bones, and argued that there was evidence of endothermy in dinosaurs. These canals are common in \"warm-blooded\" animals and are associated with fast growth and an active life style because they help to recycle bone to facilitate rapid growth and repair damage caused by stress or injuries.<ref>Ricqles, A. J. de. (1974). ''Evolution of endothermy: histological evidence''. Evolutionary Theory 1: 51\u201380</ref> Dense secondary Haversian bone, which is formed during remodeling, is found in many living endotherms as well as dinosaurs, pterosaurs and therapsids. Secondary Haversian canals are correlated with size and age, mechanical stress and nutrient turnover. The presence of secondary Haversian canals suggests comparable bone growth and lifespans in mammals and dinosaurs.<ref name=\"Fastovsky 2009, p.258\">Fastovsky & Weishampel 2009, p.258.</ref> Bakker argued that the presence of fibrolamellar bone (produced quickly and having a fibrous, woven appearance) in dinosaur fossils was evidence of endothermy.<ref name=\"Bakker1972AnatomicalAndEcologicalEvidenceOfEndothermy\" />\n\nHowever, as a result of other, mainly later research, bone structure is not considered a reliable indicator of metabolism in dinosaurs, mammals or reptiles:\n* Dinosaur bones often contain lines of arrested growth (LAGs), formed by alternating periods of slow and fast growth; in fact many studies count growth rings to estimate the ages of dinosaurs.<ref name=\"Curry1999OntogeneticHistologyOfApatosaurus\" /><ref name=\"EricksonMakovickyEtAl2004GigantismOftyrannosaurids\"/> The formation of growth rings is usually driven by seasonal changes in temperature, and this seasonal influence has sometimes been regarded as a sign of slow metabolism and ectothermy.

Although drawing conclusions about the earliest archosauriformes from later forms is tricky, because species-specific variations in bone structure and growth rate are very likely, there are research strategies than can minimize the risk that such factors will cause errors in the analysis.\n* Archosaurs split into three main groups in the [[Triassic]]: [[ornithodira]]ns, from which dinosaurs evolved, remained committed to rapid growth; [[Crocodylomorpha|crocodilians' ancestors]] adopted more typical \"reptilian\" slow growth rates; and most other Triassic archosaurs had intermediate growth rates.\n\n=== Metabolic rate, blood pressure and flow ===\n[[Endotherm]]s rely highly on aerobic metabolism and have high rates of oxygen consumption during activity and rest.

Added to this pressure is that required to move the blood through the circulatory system.  It was pointed out in 1976 that, because of their height, many dinosaurs had minimum blood pressures within the endothermic range, and that they must have had four-chambered hearts to separate the high pressure circuit to the body from the low pressure circuit to the lungs.<ref name=BP>{{cite journal|last=Seymour|first=Roger S.|title=Dinosaurs, endothermy, and blood pressure|journal=Nature|year=1976|volume=262|issue=5565|pages=207\u2013208|doi=10.1038/262207a0|bibcode = 1976Natur.262..207S }}</ref> It was not clear whether these dinosaurs had high blood pressure simply to support the blood column or to support the high blood flow rates required by endothermy or both.\n[[File:Foramen blood fow index.jpg|thumb|Foramen blood flow index, derived from the size of the nutrient foramen of the femurs of mammals, reptiles and dinosaurs]]\nHowever, recent analysis of the tiny holes in fossil leg bones of dinosaurs provides a gauge for blood flow rate and hence metabolic rate.<ref name=foramen>{{cite journal|last=Seymour|first=Roger S.|author2=Smith, Sarah L |author3=White, Craig R. |author4=Henderson, Donald M. |author5= Schwarz-Wings, Daniela |title=Blood flow to long bones indicates activity metabolism in mammals, reptiles and dinosaurs|journal=[[Proceedings of the Royal Society B]]|year=2012|volume=279|issue=1728|pages=451\u2013456|doi=10.1098/rspb.2011.0968|pmid=21733896|pmc=3234558}}</ref> The holes are called nutrient foramina, and the nutrient artery is the major blood vessel passing through to the interior of the bone, where it branches into tiny vessels of the [[Haversian canal]] system.  This system is responsible for replacing old bone with new bone, thereby repairing microbreaks that occur naturally during locomotion.  Without this repair, microbreaks would build up, leading to [[stress fractures]] and ultimately catastrophic bone failure. The size of the nutrient foramen provides an index of blood flow through it, according to the [[Hagen-Poiseuille equation]].  The size is also related to the body size of animal, of course, so this effect is removed by analysis of [[allometry]].  Blood flow index of the nutrient foramen of the femurs in living mammals increases in direct proportion to the animals' maximum metabolic rates, as measured during maximum sustained locomotion.  Mammalian blood flow index is about 10 times greater than in [[ectotherm]]ic reptiles.  Ten species of fossil dinosaurs from five taxonomic groups reveal indices even higher than in mammals, when body size is accounted for, indicating that they were highly active, aerobic animals.  Thus high blood flow rate, high blood pressure, a four-chambered heart and sustained aerobic metabolism are all consistent with [[endotherm]]y.\n\n=== Growth rates ===\nDinosaurs grew from small eggs to several tons in weight relatively quickly.

Secondly, the production of bone may not have been continuous in areas near the extremities of limbs&nbsp;\u2013 in [[allosaur]] skeketons lines of arrested growth (\"LAGs\"; rather like [[growth ring]]s) are sparse or absent in large limb bones but common in the fingers and toes. While there is no absolute proof that LAGs are temperature-related, they could mark times when the extremities were so cool that the bones ceased to grow. If so, the data about oxygen isotope ratios would be incomplete, especially for times when the extremities were coolest. Oxygen isotope ratios may be an unreliable method of estimating temperatures if it cannot be shown that bone growth was equally continuous in all parts of the animal.<ref name=\"ReidInFarlowBrettSurman1997\" />\n\n=== Predator\u2013prey ratios ===\n[[Robert T.

And since the earliest dinosaurs (e.g. ''[[Staurikosaurus]]'', ''[[Herrerasaurus]]'') were predators, all dinosaurs must have been warm-blooded.\n\nThis argument was criticized on several grounds and is no longer taken seriously (the following list of criticisms is far from exhaustive):<ref name=\"FastovskyWeishampelSibbick2005EvolutionAndExtinctionOfDinosaurs\">{{cite book |author=Fastovsky, D.E., Weishampel, D.B., and Sibbick, J. |title=The Evolution and Extinction of the Dinosaurs\n|year=2005 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-81172-9 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=M8nt10bkovIC&pg=PA371&lpg=PA371&dq=dinosaur+predator+prey+ratio }}</ref><ref name=\"Farlow1980PredatorPreyBiomassRatios\">{{Cite book |author=Farlow, J.O. |year=1980 |chapter=Predator/prey biomass ratios, community food webs and dinosaur physiology |editor=Thomas, R.D.K. |editor2=Olson, E.C. |title=A cold look at the warm-blooded dinosaurs |pages=55\u201383 |publisher=American Association for the Advancement of Science |location=Boulder, CO |chapter-url=http://bio.fsu.edu/~amarquez/Evolutionary%20Morphology%20fall%202004/Farlow/Predator-Prey%20biomass%20ratios,%20community%20food%20webs%20and%20dinosaur%20physiology.pdf |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081217091538/http://bio.fsu.edu/~amarquez/Evolutionary%20Morphology%20fall%202004/Farlow/Predator-Prey%20biomass%20ratios%2C%20community%20food%20webs%20and%20dinosaur%20physiology.pdf |archivedate=17 December 2008 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n* Estimates of dinosaur weights vary widely, and even a small variation can make a large difference to the calculated predator\u2013prey ratio.\n* His [[Sampling (statistics)|sample]] may not have been representative. Bakker obtained his numbers by counting museum specimens, but these have a bias towards rare or especially well-preserved specimens, and do not represent what exists in fossil beds. Even fossil beds may not accurately represent the actual populations, for example smaller and younger animals have less robust bones and are therefore less likely to be preserved.\n* There are no published predator\u2013prey ratios for large ectothermic predators, because such predators are very rare and mostly occur only on fairly small islands. Large ectothermic herbivores are equally rare. So Bakker was forced to compare mammalian predator\u2013prey ratios with those of fish and invertebrate communities, where life expectancies are much shorter and other differences also distort the comparison.\n* The concept assumes that predator populations are limited only by the availability of prey. However other factors such as shortage of nesting sites, cannibalism or predation of one predator on another can hold predator populations below the limit imposed by prey biomass, and this would misleadingly reduce the predator\u2013prey ratio.\n* Ecological factors can misleadingly reduce the predator\u2013prey ratio, for example: a predator might prey on only some of the \"prey\" species present;  disease, parasites and starvation might kill some of the prey animals before the predators get a chance to hunt them.\n* It is very difficult to state precisely what preys on what. For example, the young of herbivores may be preyed upon by lizards and snakes while the adults are preyed on by mammals. Conversely the young of many predators live largely on invertebrates and switch to vertebrates as they grow.\n\n=== Posture and gait ===\n{{Refimprove section|date=September 2008}}\n[[File:Sprawling and erect hip joints - horizontal.svg|thumb|right | 300px | Hip joints and limb postures.]]\nDinosaurs' limbs were erect and held under their bodies, rather than sprawling out to the sides like those of lizards and newts. The evidence for this is the angles of the joint surfaces and the locations of muscle and tendon attachments on the bones. Attempts to represent dinosaurs with sprawling limbs result in creatures with dislocated hips, knees, shoulders and elbows.<ref>This was recognized not later than 1909: {{cite web|title=Dr. Holland and the Sprawling Sauropods |url=http://www.hmnh.org/library/diplodocus/holland1910.html |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110612180650/http://www.hmnh.org/library/diplodocus/holland1910.html |archivedate=12 June 2011 }} The arguments and many of the images are also presented in {{cite book |title=Hot Blooded Dinosaurs |last=Desmond |first=A. |authorlink=Adrian Desmond |publisher=DoubleDay |year=1976 |isbn=978-0-385-27063-2}}</ref>\n\n[[Carrier's constraint]] states that air-breathing vertebrates with two lungs that flex their bodies sideways during locomotion find it difficult to move and breathe at the same time. This severely limits stamina, and forces them to spend more time resting than moving.<ref name=\"Carrier1987LocomotorStaminaInTetrapods\" />\n\nSprawling limbs require sideways flexing during locomotion (except for tortoises and turtles, which are very slow and whose armor keeps their bodies fairly rigid). However, despite Carrier's constraint, sprawling limbs are efficient for creatures that spend most of their time resting on their bellies and only move for a few seconds at a time\u2014because this arrangement minimizes the energy costs of getting up and lying down.\n\nErect limbs increase the costs of getting up and lying down, but avoid Carrier's constraint. This indicates that dinosaurs were active animals because [[natural selection]] would have favored the retention of sprawling limbs if dinosaurs had been sluggish and spent most of their waking time resting. An active lifestyle requires a metabolism that quickly regenerates energy supplies and breaks down waste products which cause fatigue, i.e., it requires a fairly fast metabolism and a considerable degree of homeothermy.\n\nAdditionally, an erect posture demands precise balance, the result of a rapidly functioning neuromuscular system. This suggests endothermic metabolism, because an ectothermic animal would be unable to walk or run, and thus to evade predators, when its core temperature was lowered. Other evidence for endothermy includes limb length (many dinosaurs possessed comparatively long limbs) and bipedalism, both found today only in endotherms.<ref>Fastovsky & Weishampel 2009, p.251.</ref> Many bipedal dinosaurs possessed gracile leg bones with a short thigh relative to calf length. This is generally an adaptation to frequent sustained running, characteristic of endotherms which, unlike ectotherms, are capable of producing sufficient energy to stave off the onset of anaerobic metabolism in the muscle.<ref>Fastovsky & Weishampel 2009, p.252.</ref>\n\nBakker and Ostrom both pointed out that all dinosaurs had erect hindlimbs and that all quadrupedal dinosaurs had erect forelimbs; and that among living animals only the endothermic (\"warm-blooded\") mammals and birds have erect limbs (Ostrom acknowledged that [[crocodilian]]s' occasional \"high walk\" was a partial exception).

In living birds and mammals, water loss is limited by pulling moisture out of exhaled air with mucous-covered respiratory turbinates, tissue-covered bony sheets in the nasal cavity. Several dinosaurs have olfactory turbinates, used for smell, but none have yet been identified with respiratory turbinates.<ref name=\"Fastovsky 2009, p.255\">Fastovsky & Weishampel 2009, p.255.</ref>\n\nBecause endothermy allows refined neuromuscular control, and because brain matter requires large amounts of energy to sustain, some speculate that increased brain size indicates increased activity and, thus, endothermy. The encephalization quotient (EQ) of dinosaurs, a measure of brain size calculated using brain endocasts, varies on a spectrum from bird-like to reptile-like. Using EQ alone, coelosaurs appear to have been as active as living mammals, while theropods and ornithopods fall somewhere between mammals and reptiles, and other dinosaurs resemble reptiles.<ref name=\"Fastovsky 2009, p.255\"/>\n\nA study published by Roger Seymour in 2013 added more support to the idea that dinosaurs were endothermic. After studying saltwater crocodiles, Seymour found that even if their large sizes could provide stable and high body temperatures, during activity the crocodile's ectothermic metabolism provided less aerobic abilities and generate only 14% of the total muscle power of a similar sized endothermic mammal before full fatigue.

Later dinosaurs regarded as predators sometimes grew much larger, but retained the same set of features. Instead of chewing their food, these predators swallowed it whole.<ref name=\"Norman2001DinosaurFeeding\">{{Cite book\n| author=Norman, D.B. | chapter=Dinosaur Feeding | date=April 2001\n| title=Encyclopedia of Life Sciences | publisher= John Wiley & Sons | doi=10.1038/npg.els.0003321\n| chapter-url=http://mrw.interscience.wiley.com/emrw/9780470015902/els/article/a0003321/current/abstract\n| accessdate=2009-09-10\n| isbn=978-0470016176 }}</ref>\n\nThe feeding habits of [[ornithomimosaur]]s and [[oviraptorosaur]]s are a mystery: although they evolved from a predatory [[theropod]] lineage, they have small jaws and lack the blade-like teeth of typical predators, but there is no evidence of their diet or how they ate and digested it.<ref name=\"Norman2001DinosaurFeeding\" />\n\nFeatures of other groups of dinosaurs indicate they were herbivores. These features include:\n* Jaws that only slightly opened and closed so that all the teeth met at the same time\n* Large abdomens that could accommodate large amounts of vegetation and store it for the long time it takes to digest vegetation\n* Guts that likely contained [[Endosymbiotic]] micro-organisms that digest [[cellulose]], as no known animal can digest this tough material directly<ref name=\"Norman2001DinosaurFeeding\" />\n\n[[Sauropod]]s, which were herbivores, did not chew their food, as their teeth and jaws appear suitable only for stripping leaves off plants. [[Ornithischian]]s, also herbivores, show a variety of approaches. The armored [[ankylosaur]]s and [[stegosaur]]s had small heads and weak jaws and teeth, and are thought to have fed in much the same way as sauropods. The [[pachycephalosaur]]s had small heads and weak jaws and teeth, but their lack of large digestive systems suggests a different diet, possibly fruits, seeds, or young shoots, which would have been more nutritious to them than leaves.<ref name=\"Norman2001DinosaurFeeding\" />\n\nOn the other hand, [[ornithopod]]s such as ''[[Hypsilophodon]]'', ''[[Iguanodon]]'' and various [[hadrosaur]]s had horny beaks for snipping off vegetation and jaws and teeth that were well-adapted for chewing. The horned [[ceratopsian]]s had similar mechanisms.<ref name=\"Norman2001DinosaurFeeding\" />\n\nIt has often been suggested that at least some dinosaurs used swallowed stones, known as [[gastrolith]]s, to aid digestion by grinding their food in muscular [[gizzard]]s, and that this was a feature they shared with birds. In 2007 Oliver Wings reviewed references to gastroliths in scientific literature and found considerable confusion, starting with the lack of an agreed and objective definition of \"gastrolith\". He found that swallowed hard stones or grit can assist digestion in birds that mainly feed on grain but may not be essential\u2014and that birds that eat insects in summer and grain in winter usually get rid of the stones and grit in summer. Gastroliths have often been described as important for [[sauropod]] dinosaurs, whose diet of vegetation required very thorough digestion, but Wings concluded that this idea was incorrect: gastroliths are found with only a small percentage of sauropod fossils; where they have been found, the amounts are too small and in many cases the stones are too soft to have been effective in grinding food; most of these gastroliths are highly polished, but gastroliths used by modern animals to grind food are roughened by wear and corroded by stomach acids; hence the sauropod gastroliths were probably swallowed accidentally. On the other hand, he concluded that gastroliths found with fossils of advanced [[theropod]] dinosaurs such as ''[[Sinornithomimus]]'' and ''[[Caudipteryx]]'' resemble those of birds, and that the use of gastroliths for grinding food may have appeared early in the group of dinosaurs from which these dinosaurs and birds both evolved.<ref name=\"Wings2007ReviewOfGastrolithFunction\">{{cite journal\n| author=Wings, O. | year=2007\n| title=A review of gastrolith function with implications for fossil vertebrates and a revised classification\n| journal=Acta Palaeontologica Polonica | volume=52 | issue=1 |pages=1\u201316\n| url=http://app.pan.pl/archive/published/app52/app52-001.pdf | accessdate=2008-09-10\n}}</ref><ref name=\"WingsSander2007NoGastricMillInSauropods\">{{cite journal\n|author1=Wings, O. |author2=Sander.

But this does not imply that ornithischians could not have had metabolic rates comparable to those of mammals, since mammals also do not have air sacs.<ref name=\"ReidInFarlowBrettSurman1997\" />\n\nThree explanations have been suggested for the development of air sacs in dinosaurs:<ref name=\"SerenoMartinezEtAl2008AvianIntrathoracicAirSacsInNewPredatoryDinosaur\" />\n* Increase in respiratory capacity. This is probably the most common hypothesis, and fits well with the idea that many dinosaurs had fairly high [[metabolic rate]]s.\n* Improving balance and maneuvrability by lowering the [[center of gravity]] and reducing [[rotational inertia]]. However this does not explain the expansion of air sacs in the quadrupedal sauropods.\n* As a cooling mechanism. It seems that air sacs and feathers evolved at about the same time in [[coelurosaur]]s. If feathers retained heat, their owners would have required a means of dissipating excess heat. This idea is plausible but needs further empirical support.\n\nCalculations of the volumes of various parts of the sauropod ''Apatosaurus''' respiratory system support the evidence of bird-like air sacs in sauropods:\n* Assuming that ''Apatosaurus'', like dinosaurs' nearest surviving relatives [[crocodilia]]ns and birds, did not have a [[Thoracic diaphragm|diaphragm]], the [[dead space (physiology)|dead-space volume]] of a 30-ton specimen would be about 184 liters. This is the total volume of the mouth, trachea and air tubes. If the animal exhales less than this, stale air is not expelled and is sucked back into the lungs on the following inhalation.\n* Estimates of its [[Lung volumes|tidal volume]]&nbsp;\u2013 the amount of air moved into or out of the lungs in a single breath&nbsp;\u2013 depend on the type of [[respiratory system]] the animal had: 904&nbsp;liters if avian; 225&nbsp;liters if mammalian; 19&nbsp;liters if reptilian.\nOn this basis, ''Apatosaurus'' could not have had a reptilian respiratory system, as its tidal volume would have been less than its dead-space volume, so that stale air was not expelled but was sucked back into the lungs. Likewise, a mammalian system would only provide to the lungs about 225&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;184&nbsp;=&nbsp;41&nbsp;liters of fresh, oxygenated air on each breath. ''Apatosaurus'' must therefore have had either a system unknown in the modern world or one like [[Bird anatomy#Respiratory system|birds]]', with multiple air sacs and a flow-through lung. Furthermore, an avian system would only need a lung volume of about 600&nbsp;liters while a mammalian one would have required about 2,950&nbsp;liters, which would exceed the estimated 1,700&nbsp;liters of space available in a 30-ton ''Apatosaurus''\u2032 chest.<ref name=\"PaladinoEtAlInFarlowBrettSurman1997\">{{Cite book |author=Paladino, F.V., Spotila, J.R., and Dodson, P. |year=1997 |contribution=A Blueprint for Giants: Modeling the Physiology of Large Dinosaurs |editor=Farlow, J.O. |editor2=Brett-Surman, M.K.  |title=The Complete Dinosaur |pages=491\u2013504 |isbn=978-0-253-21313-6 |publisher=Indiana University Press |location=Bloomington, Ind.}}</ref>\n\nDinosaur respiratory systems with bird-like air sacs may have been capable of sustaining higher activity levels than mammals of similar size and build can sustain.

The activity of metabolic enzymes varies with temperature, so temperature control is vital for any organism, whether endothermic or ectothermic. Organisms can be categorized as [[poikilotherms]] (poikilo&nbsp;\u2013 changing), which are tolerant of internal temperature fluctuations, and [[homeotherms]] (homeo&nbsp;\u2013 same), which must maintain a constant core temperature. Animals can be further categorized as [[endotherms]], which regulate their temperature internally, and [[ectotherms]], which regulate temperature by the use of external heat sources.\n\n=== What the debate is about ===\n{{see also|Gigantothermy}}\n\"[[Warm-blooded]]ness\" is a complex and rather ambiguous term, because it includes some or all of:\n* '''[[Homeotherm]]y''', i.e. maintaining a fairly constant body temperature. Modern endotherms maintain a variety of temperatures: {{convert|28|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}} to {{convert|30|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}} in [[monotreme]]s and [[sloth]]s;  {{convert|33|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}} to {{convert|36|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}} in [[marsupial]]s;  {{convert|36|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}} to {{convert|38|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}} in most [[placental]]s; and around {{convert|41|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}} in birds.<ref name=\"ReidInFarlowBrettSurman1997\" />\n* '''[[Tachymetabolism]]''', i.e. maintaining a high [[metabolic rate]], particularly when at rest. This requires a fairly high and stable body temperature, since biochemical processes run about half as fast if an animal's temperature drops by 10C\u00b0; most [[enzyme]]s have an optimum [[operating temperature]] and their efficiency drops rapidly outside the preferred range.<ref name=\"McGowan11991DinosaursSpitfiresSeaDragonsP133To135\">{{cite book |author=McGowan, C. |title=Dinosaurs, Spitfires and Sea Dragons |year=1991 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/dinosaursspitfir00mcgo/page/133 133\u2013135] |publisher=Harvard University Press |isbn=978-0-674-20769-1 |url=https://archive.org/details/dinosaursspitfir00mcgo/page/133 }}</ref>\n* '''[[Endotherm]]y''', i.e. the ability to generate heat internally, for example by \"burning\" fat, rather than via behaviors such as basking or muscular activity. Although endothermy is in principle the most reliable way to maintain a fairly constant temperature, it is expensive; for example modern mammals need 10 to 13 times as much food as modern reptiles.<ref name=\"ReidInFarlowBrettSurman1997\" />\n\nLarge dinosaurs may also have maintained their temperatures by inertial homeothermy, also known as \"bulk homeothermy\" or \"mass homeothermy\". In other words, the [[thermal capacity]] of such large animals was so high that it would take two days or more for their temperatures to change significantly, and this would have smoothed out variations caused by daily temperature cycles. This smoothing effect has been observed in large turtles and [[crocodilian]]s, but ''[[Plateosaurus]]'', which weighed about {{convert|700|kg|lb}}, may have been the smallest dinosaur in which it would have been effective.

In all modern reptiles and most mammals and birds the maximum rates during all-out activity are 10 to 20 times higher than minimum rates while at rest. However, in a few mammals these rates differ by a factor of 70. Theoretically it would be possible for a land vertebrate to have a reptilian metabolic rate at rest and a bird-like rate while working flat out. However, an animal with such a low resting rate would be unable to grow quickly. The huge [[herbivorous]] [[sauropod]]s may have been on the move so constantly in search of food that their energy expenditure would have been much the same irrespective of whether their resting metabolic rates were high or low.<ref>{{Cite book\n| author=Paul, G.S. | chapter=Cope's rule | page=211\n| title=Morrison Symposium Proceedings: A Special Issue Of The Journal Modern Geology\n| editor=Carpenter, K. |editor2=Fraser, N. |editor3=Chure, D. |editor4=Kirkland, J.I.\n| publisher=Taylor & Francis | year=1998 | isbn=978-90-5699-183-8\n| chapter-url=https://books.google.com/?id=CLEPeg_SjTcC&dq=sprawling+limbs+efficient | accessdate=2008-09-12\n}}</ref>\n\n=== Metabolic options ===\nThe main possibilities are that:<ref name=\"ReidInFarlowBrettSurman1997\" />\n* Dinosaurs were cold-blooded, like modern reptiles, except that the large size of many would have stabilized their body temperatures.\n* They were warm-blooded, more like modern mammals or birds than modern reptiles.\n* They were neither cold-blooded nor warm-blooded in modern terms, but had metabolisms that were different from and in some ways intermediate between those of modern cold-blooded and warm-blooded animals.\n* They included animals with two or three of these types of metabolism.\n\nDinosaurs were around for about 150 million years, so it is very likely that different groups evolved different metabolisms and thermoregulatory regimes, and that some developed different physiologies from the first dinosaurs.\n\nIf all or some dinosaurs had intermediate metabolisms, they may have had the following features:<ref name=\"ReidInFarlowBrettSurman1997\" />\n* Low resting metabolic rates\u2014which would reduce the amount of food they needed and allow them to use more of that food for growth than do animals with high resting metabolic rates.\n* Inertial homeothermy\n* The ability to control heat loss by expanding and contracting blood vessels just under the skin, as many modern reptiles do.\n* Two-part circulations driven by four-chambered hearts.\n* High [[aerobic capacity]], allowing sustained activity.\nRobert Reid has suggested that such animals could be regarded as \"failed endotherms\". He envisaged both dinosaurs and the Triassic ancestors of mammals passing through a stage with these features. Mammals were forced to become smaller as [[archosaur]]s came to dominate [[ecological niche]]s for medium to large animals. Their decreasing size made them more vulnerable to heat loss because it increased their ratios of surface area to mass, and thus forced them to increase internal heat generation and thus become full endotherms. On the other hand, dinosaurs became medium to very large animals and thus were able to retain the \"intermediate\" type of metabolism.<ref name=\"ReidInFarlowBrettSurman1997\" />\n\n=== Bone structure ===\nArmand de Ricql\u00e8s discovered [[Haversian canals]] in dinosaur bones, and argued that there was evidence of endothermy in dinosaurs. These canals are common in \"warm-blooded\" animals and are associated with fast growth and an active life style because they help to recycle bone to facilitate rapid growth and repair damage caused by stress or injuries.<ref>Ricqles, A. J. de. (1974). ''Evolution of endothermy: histological evidence''. Evolutionary Theory 1: 51\u201380</ref> Dense secondary Haversian bone, which is formed during remodeling, is found in many living endotherms as well as dinosaurs, pterosaurs and therapsids. Secondary Haversian canals are correlated with size and age, mechanical stress and nutrient turnover.

This system is responsible for replacing old bone with new bone, thereby repairing microbreaks that occur naturally during locomotion.  Without this repair, microbreaks would build up, leading to [[stress fractures]] and ultimately catastrophic bone failure. The size of the nutrient foramen provides an index of blood flow through it, according to the [[Hagen-Poiseuille equation]].  The size is also related to the body size of animal, of course, so this effect is removed by analysis of [[allometry]].  Blood flow index of the nutrient foramen of the femurs in living mammals increases in direct proportion to the animals' maximum metabolic rates, as measured during maximum sustained locomotion.  Mammalian blood flow index is about 10 times greater than in [[ectotherm]]ic reptiles.  Ten species of fossil dinosaurs from five taxonomic groups reveal indices even higher than in mammals, when body size is accounted for, indicating that they were highly active, aerobic animals.  Thus high blood flow rate, high blood pressure, a four-chambered heart and sustained aerobic metabolism are all consistent with [[endotherm]]y.\n\n=== Growth rates ===\nDinosaurs grew from small eggs to several tons in weight relatively quickly.

Bakker obtained his numbers by counting museum specimens, but these have a bias towards rare or especially well-preserved specimens, and do not represent what exists in fossil beds. Even fossil beds may not accurately represent the actual populations, for example smaller and younger animals have less robust bones and are therefore less likely to be preserved.\n* There are no published predator\u2013prey ratios for large ectothermic predators, because such predators are very rare and mostly occur only on fairly small islands. Large ectothermic herbivores are equally rare. So Bakker was forced to compare mammalian predator\u2013prey ratios with those of fish and invertebrate communities, where life expectancies are much shorter and other differences also distort the comparison.\n* The concept assumes that predator populations are limited only by the availability of prey. However other factors such as shortage of nesting sites, cannibalism or predation of one predator on another can hold predator populations below the limit imposed by prey biomass, and this would misleadingly reduce the predator\u2013prey ratio.\n* Ecological factors can misleadingly reduce the predator\u2013prey ratio, for example: a predator might prey on only some of the \"prey\" species present;  disease, parasites and starvation might kill some of the prey animals before the predators get a chance to hunt them.\n* It is very difficult to state precisely what preys on what. For example, the young of herbivores may be preyed upon by lizards and snakes while the adults are preyed on by mammals. Conversely the young of many predators live largely on invertebrates and switch to vertebrates as they grow.\n\n=== Posture and gait ===\n{{Refimprove section|date=September 2008}}\n[[File:Sprawling and erect hip joints - horizontal.svg|thumb|right | 300px | Hip joints and limb postures.]]\nDinosaurs' limbs were erect and held under their bodies, rather than sprawling out to the sides like those of lizards and newts. The evidence for this is the angles of the joint surfaces and the locations of muscle and tendon attachments on the bones. Attempts to represent dinosaurs with sprawling limbs result in creatures with dislocated hips, knees, shoulders and elbows.<ref>This was recognized not later than 1909: {{cite web|title=Dr. Holland and the Sprawling Sauropods |url=http://www.hmnh.org/library/diplodocus/holland1910.html |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110612180650/http://www.hmnh.org/library/diplodocus/holland1910.html |archivedate=12 June 2011 }} The arguments and many of the images are also presented in {{cite book |title=Hot Blooded Dinosaurs |last=Desmond |first=A. |authorlink=Adrian Desmond |publisher=DoubleDay |year=1976 |isbn=978-0-385-27063-2}}</ref>\n\n[[Carrier's constraint]] states that air-breathing vertebrates with two lungs that flex their bodies sideways during locomotion find it difficult to move and breathe at the same time. This severely limits stamina, and forces them to spend more time resting than moving.<ref name=\"Carrier1987LocomotorStaminaInTetrapods\" />\n\nSprawling limbs require sideways flexing during locomotion (except for tortoises and turtles, which are very slow and whose armor keeps their bodies fairly rigid). However, despite Carrier's constraint, sprawling limbs are efficient for creatures that spend most of their time resting on their bellies and only move for a few seconds at a time\u2014because this arrangement minimizes the energy costs of getting up and lying down.\n\nErect limbs increase the costs of getting up and lying down, but avoid Carrier's constraint. This indicates that dinosaurs were active animals because [[natural selection]] would have favored the retention of sprawling limbs if dinosaurs had been sluggish and spent most of their waking time resting. An active lifestyle requires a metabolism that quickly regenerates energy supplies and breaks down waste products which cause fatigue, i.e., it requires a fairly fast metabolism and a considerable degree of homeothermy.\n\nAdditionally, an erect posture demands precise balance, the result of a rapidly functioning neuromuscular system. This suggests endothermic metabolism, because an ectothermic animal would be unable to walk or run, and thus to evade predators, when its core temperature was lowered. Other evidence for endothermy includes limb length (many dinosaurs possessed comparatively long limbs) and bipedalism, both found today only in endotherms.<ref>Fastovsky & Weishampel 2009, p.251.</ref> Many bipedal dinosaurs possessed gracile leg bones with a short thigh relative to calf length. This is generally an adaptation to frequent sustained running, characteristic of endotherms which, unlike ectotherms, are capable of producing sufficient energy to stave off the onset of anaerobic metabolism in the muscle.<ref>Fastovsky & Weishampel 2009, p.252.</ref>\n\nBakker and Ostrom both pointed out that all dinosaurs had erect hindlimbs and that all quadrupedal dinosaurs had erect forelimbs; and that among living animals only the endothermic (\"warm-blooded\") mammals and birds have erect limbs (Ostrom acknowledged that [[crocodilian]]s' occasional \"high walk\" was a partial exception).

Such dinosaurs could have used these sails to:\n* take in heat by basking with the \"sails\" at right angles to the sun's rays.\n* to lose heat by using the \"sails\" as radiators while standing in the shade or while facing directly towards or away from the sun.\nBut these were a very small minority of known dinosaur species.\nOne common interpretation of the plates on stegosaurs' backs is as [[heat exchanger]]s for thermoregulation, as the plates are filled with blood vessels, which, theoretically, could absorb and dissipate heat.<ref name=\"BufrenilFalrowRiqles1986\">{{cite journal |author=de Bufrenil, V., Farlow, J.O., and de Riqles, A. |title=Growth and function of ''Stegosaurus'' plates: evidence from bone histology |journal=Paleobiology |volume=12 |issue=4 |year=1986 |pages=459\u2013473  |jstor=2400518 |doi=10.1017/S0094837300003171 }}</ref>\n{{clear}} This might have worked for a stegosaur with large plates, such as ''[[Stegosaurus]]'', but other stegosaurs, such as ''[[Wuerhosaurus]]'', ''[[Tuojiangosaurus]]'' and ''[[Kentrosaurus]]'' possessed much smaller plates with a surface area of doubtful value for thermo-regulation.

In living birds and mammals, water loss is limited by pulling moisture out of exhaled air with mucous-covered respiratory turbinates, tissue-covered bony sheets in the nasal cavity. Several dinosaurs have olfactory turbinates, used for smell, but none have yet been identified with respiratory turbinates.<ref name=\"Fastovsky 2009, p.255\">Fastovsky & Weishampel 2009, p.255.</ref>\n\nBecause endothermy allows refined neuromuscular control, and because brain matter requires large amounts of energy to sustain, some speculate that increased brain size indicates increased activity and, thus, endothermy. The encephalization quotient (EQ) of dinosaurs, a measure of brain size calculated using brain endocasts, varies on a spectrum from bird-like to reptile-like. Using EQ alone, coelosaurs appear to have been as active as living mammals, while theropods and ornithopods fall somewhere between mammals and reptiles, and other dinosaurs resemble reptiles.<ref name=\"Fastovsky 2009, p.255\"/>\n\nA study published by Roger Seymour in 2013 added more support to the idea that dinosaurs were endothermic. After studying saltwater crocodiles, Seymour found that even if their large sizes could provide stable and high body temperatures, during activity the crocodile's ectothermic metabolism provided less aerobic abilities and generate only 14% of the total muscle power of a similar sized endothermic mammal before full fatigue. Seymour reasoned that dinosaurs would have needed to be endothermic since they would have needed better aerobic abilities and higher power generation to compete with and dominate over mammals as active land animals throughout the Mesozoic era.<ref name=\"SeymourMetabolism\">{{Cite journal\n | author=Seymour Roger S.\n | title=Maximal Aerobic and Anaerobic Power Generation in Large Crocodiles versus Mammals: Implications for Dinosaur Gigantothermy \n | journal=PLOS ONE\n | date=5 July 2013\n | volume=8\n | issue=7\n | pages=e69361\n | doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0069361\n | pmid=23861968\n | pmc=3702618\n| bibcode=2013PLoSO...869361S\n }}</ref><ref name=\"SeymourRogerCrocDinoStudy\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2370365/Dinosaurs-NOT-cold-blooded-physically-weak-claim-scientists.html\n|title=Dinosaurs were NOT cold-blooded because it would have made them physically weak, claim scientists\n|author=Griffiths, Sarah\n|publisher=Associated Newspapers Ltd\n|date=9 July 2013 \n|accessdate=2013-08-12 }}</ref>\n\n=== The crocodilian puzzle and early archosaur metabolism ===\n{{Refimprove section|date=September 2008}}\nIt appears that the earliest dinosaurs had the features that form the basis for arguments for warm-blooded dinosaurs\u2014especially erect limbs.

Mammals and birds have four-chambered hearts. Non-crocodilian reptiles have three-chambered hearts, which are less efficient because they allow oxygenated and de-oxygenated blood to mix and therefore send some de-oxygenated blood out to the body instead of to the lungs. Modern crocodilians' hearts are four-chambered, but are smaller relative to body size and run at lower pressure than those of modern mammals and birds.

He has been active in his YouTube Channel, '''FumiShun Base''', since 2015. His fame grew when he became the first pure Japanese official housemate in [[Pinoy Big Brother: Otso]], a reality TV show for Filipinos.

He is the eldest in their family. \n\nAfter his High School graduation, Fumiya started living alone in [[Tokyo]] while pursuing his vocational degree in Hotel Management.\n\nHe joined the hospitality workforce after his graduation from vocational school and worked in a hotel in [[Shinjuku]] as a bell boy. He resigned from his hotel job after two years and decided to pursue his dream of establishing his own clothing line. \n\nHe thought that being famous would make his clothes sell faster and one way would be to become famous as a vlogger. He then started making YouTube videos.\n\n=== 2017 \u2013 Present: Life in the Philippines ===\nHaving observed their hotel guests, he realized that being able to speak English is important for his business plans. On the 28<sup>th</sup> day of April, 2017, he flew to the Philippines to study English.<ref name=\":3\">{{Citation|title=I'm back on YouTube!!|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WCGuUXSewvc|language=en|access-date=2020-04-25}}</ref>\n\nHe attended the [[Lyceum of the Philippines University|Lyceum of the Philippines]] in Manila for his English lessons. \n\nHe learnt of the PBB audition from his Filipino followers. He attended and documented his audition for his vlog content but he was able to pass all the screenings and became an official PBB OTSO housemate.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nAfter PBB, he stayed in the Philippines to pursue a career in show-business.\n<br />\n\n==Career==\n\n===YouTube===\n\nFumiya established his YouTube channel, '''FumiShun Base''', with his brother Shunya on December 2, 2015, but only posted their first video on September 6, 2016. \n\nWhile studying in the Philippines, he continued to upload videos in his YouTube channel as a means to update his parents of his whereabouts. \n\nHe started uploading YouTube contents for Filipinos on the 31<sup>st</sup> of May 2017. His first video was a reaction video of [[Sarah Geronimo]]'s [[Kilometro (song)|Kilometro]]. From then on, he started gaining Filipino followers.\n\nOn April 2018, his channel hit 100K subscribers awarding him with the YouTube Silver play button.<ref>{{Citation|title=MARAMING SALAMAT PO!!!!!!!!!!|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0R9htbO1t6M|language=en|access-date=2020-04-25}}</ref> On March 7, 2019, he hit the one million subscribers mark, awarding him with a gold play button.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://starcinema.abs-cbn.com/2019/3/7/news/fumiya-sankai-hits-1-million-subscribers-on-youtub-47849|title=Fumiya Sankai hits 1 million subscribers on YouTube! {{!}} Star Cinema|last=Admin|first=Star Cinema|website=starcinema.abs-cbn.com|access-date=January 26, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://push.abs-cbn.com/2019/3/7/fresh-scoops/pbb-housemate-fumiya-sankai-hits-1-million-youtube-203967|title=PBB housemate Fumiya Sankai hits 1 million Youtube subscribers {{!}} PUSH.COM.PH: Your ultimate showbiz hub!|last=TEAM|first=PUSH|website=push.abs-cbn.com|access-date=January 26, 2020}}</ref>\n\nSome notable vlogs were his song covers of [[I\u00f1igo Pascual]]\u2019s [[Dahil Sa'yo|Dahil Sayo]], [[Daniel Padilla]]\u2019s [[Simpleng Tulad Mo]], [[Juan Karlos Labajo|Juan Karlos]]\u2019 Buwan, [[Maja Salvador]]\u2019s Dahan Dahan, and [[Ex Battalion|Ex Battallion]]\u2019s [[Hayaan Mo Sila]] which was featured in [[Rated K]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://news.abs-cbn.com/trending/03/18/18/viral-japanese-guy-covers-hayaan-mo-sila|title=VIRAL: Japanese guy covers 'Hayaan Mo Sila'|last=News|first=ABS-CBN|website=ABS-CBN News|language=en|access-date=2020-04-25}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ent.abs-cbn.com/videos/44040719-the-life-of-andre-lou-fumiya-and-yamyam-before-joining-pbb-226307|title=Rated K: The life of Andre, Lou, Fumiya and Yamyam before joining PBB {{!}} ABS-CBN Entertainment|website=ent.abs-cbn.com|access-date=2020-04-25}}</ref>\n\nOther notable vlogs are his auditions to [[Pinoy Big Brother: Otso|PBB Otso]] in Araneta Cubao and Cebu.\n\nWhen the channel started, Japanese was the primary language used in his videos. English subtitles were added since most of his subscribers were Filipinos. After his stint in PBB, he shifted to a mixture of English and Tagalog. Subtitles were no longer added. \n\nThis posed a problem for his growing fanbase. With the growing demand from Japanese subscribers, he established the '''Hiragana FumiShun Base''' '''(\u3075\u307f\u3057\u3085\u3093\u3079\u30fc\u3059)''' YouTube Channel on April 13, 2020.

Most of his business ventures are aligned to this dream.\n\nFumiya opened the official shop for his YouTube channel on June 22, 2019. The shop features his original designs from when he started his channel. Items were sold out on the first week.\n\nHe also did a collaboration with Livertineage Japan.

He is the eldest in their family. \n\nAfter his High School graduation, Fumiya started living alone in [[Tokyo]] while pursuing his vocational degree in Hotel Management.\n\nHe joined the hospitality workforce after his graduation from vocational school and worked in a hotel in [[Shinjuku]] as a bell boy. He resigned from his hotel job after two years and decided to pursue his dream of establishing his own clothing line. \n\nHe thought that being famous would make his clothes sell faster and one way would be to become famous as a vlogger. He then started making YouTube videos.\n\n=== 2017 \u2013 Present: Life in the Philippines ===\nHaving observed their hotel guests, he realized that being able to speak English is important for his business plans. On the 28<sup>th</sup> day of April, 2017, he flew to the Philippines to study English.<ref name=\":3\">{{Citation|title=I'm back on YouTube!!|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WCGuUXSewvc|language=en|access-date=2020-04-25}}</ref>\n\nHe attended the [[Lyceum of the Philippines University|Lyceum of the Philippines]] in Manila for his English lessons. \n\nHe learnt of the PBB audition from his Filipino followers. He attended and documented his audition for his vlog content but he was able to pass all the screenings and became an official PBB OTSO housemate.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nAfter PBB, he stayed in the Philippines to pursue a career in show-business.\n<br />\n\n==Career==\n\n===YouTube===\n\nFumiya established his YouTube channel, '''FumiShun Base''', with his brother Shunya on December 2, 2015, but only posted their first video on September 6, 2016. \n\nWhile studying in the Philippines, he continued to upload videos in his YouTube channel as a means to update his parents of his whereabouts. \n\nHe started uploading YouTube contents for Filipinos on the 31<sup>st</sup> of May 2017. His first video was a reaction video of [[Sarah Geronimo]]'s [[Kilometro (song)|Kilometro]]. From then on, he started gaining Filipino followers.\n\nOn April 2018, his channel hit 100K subscribers awarding him with the YouTube Silver play button.<ref>{{Citation|title=MARAMING SALAMAT PO!!!!!!!!!!|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0R9htbO1t6M|language=en|access-date=2020-04-25}}</ref> On March 7, 2019, he hit the one million subscribers mark, awarding him with a gold play button.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://starcinema.abs-cbn.com/2019/3/7/news/fumiya-sankai-hits-1-million-subscribers-on-youtub-47849|title=Fumiya Sankai hits 1 million subscribers on YouTube! {{!}} Star Cinema|last=Admin|first=Star Cinema|website=starcinema.abs-cbn.com|access-date=January 26, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://push.abs-cbn.com/2019/3/7/fresh-scoops/pbb-housemate-fumiya-sankai-hits-1-million-youtube-203967|title=PBB housemate Fumiya Sankai hits 1 million Youtube subscribers {{!}} PUSH.COM.PH: Your ultimate showbiz hub!|last=TEAM|first=PUSH|website=push.abs-cbn.com|access-date=January 26, 2020}}</ref>\n\nSome notable vlogs were his song covers of [[I\u00f1igo Pascual]]\u2019s [[Dahil Sa'yo|Dahil Sayo]], [[Daniel Padilla]]\u2019s [[Simpleng Tulad Mo]], [[Juan Karlos Labajo|Juan Karlos]]\u2019 Buwan, [[Maja Salvador]]\u2019s Dahan Dahan, and [[Ex Battalion|Ex Battallion]]\u2019s [[Hayaan Mo Sila]] which was featured in [[Rated K]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://news.abs-cbn.com/trending/03/18/18/viral-japanese-guy-covers-hayaan-mo-sila|title=VIRAL: Japanese guy covers 'Hayaan Mo Sila'|last=News|first=ABS-CBN|website=ABS-CBN News|language=en|access-date=2020-04-25}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ent.abs-cbn.com/videos/44040719-the-life-of-andre-lou-fumiya-and-yamyam-before-joining-pbb-226307|title=Rated K: The life of Andre, Lou, Fumiya and Yamyam before joining PBB {{!}} ABS-CBN Entertainment|website=ent.abs-cbn.com|access-date=2020-04-25}}</ref>\n\nOther notable vlogs are his auditions to [[Pinoy Big Brother: Otso|PBB Otso]] in Araneta Cubao and Cebu.\n\nWhen the channel started, Japanese was the primary language used in his videos. English subtitles were added since most of his subscribers were Filipinos. After his stint in PBB, he shifted to a mixture of English and Tagalog. Subtitles were no longer added. \n\nThis posed a problem for his growing fanbase. With the growing demand from Japanese subscribers, he established the '''Hiragana FumiShun Base''' '''(\u3075\u307f\u3057\u3085\u3093\u3079\u30fc\u3059)''' YouTube Channel on April 13, 2020.
