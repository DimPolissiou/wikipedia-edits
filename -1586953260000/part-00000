{"title_page": "Deaths in 2020", "text_new": "{{pp-vandalism|small=yes}}\n{{Short description|List of notable individuals who died in 2020}}\nThe following deaths of notable individuals occurred in 2020. Names are reported under the date of death, in alphabetical order by surname or pseudonym.\n\nA typical entry reports information in the following sequence:\n\n* Name, age, country of citizenship at birth, subsequent [[nationality]] (if applicable), what subject was noted for, cause of death (if known), and reference.\n\n<!--\n* * * * * * * Please adhere to the guidelines below when adding a name to this article. * * * * * * *\n\nA typical entry reports information in the following sequence: Name, age, country of citizenship at birth or nationality if the subject is not eligible (for example, in the case of animals), subsequent nationality (if applicable), what subject was noted for, cause of death (if known), and reference. Do not place a period at the end of the entry. Names are reported under the date of death. Names under each date are reported in alphabetical order by surname or pseudonym.\n\n(1) Please add only those meeting Wikipedia notability guidelines. Include a reference to a reliable source.[a] [b] If a Wikipedia article for the dead does not yet exist, reconsider whether the subject is actually notable. If so, consider writing an article yourself. Those without a Wikipedia article are removed after one month.\n\n(2) Please understand that the intent of this article is to report notable deaths. Tragic deaths, while unfortunate, do not necessarily render the dead \"notable\". If you report the death of a notable subject that does not already have a Wikipedia article, consider starting one. Include third-party sources other than the obituary.\n\n(3) Please add entries in alphabetical order by family name. Please avoid over-linking. As such, please do not add links to nationalities, common occupations, or common causes of death. Rather, include only \"links that aid navigation and understanding\". Thank you.\n\n(4) References should be in <ref>[url & title]</ref> format, as full citations make the page too slow to load, and too big to edit.\n\n--Notes--\n[a] See [[WP:RS]] for definition of reliable source, and [[WP:BLPSOURCE]] for living and recently deceased persons.\n[b] For information on using information from Ancestry.com, Find-a-grave, or IMDb, please see [[WP:ELPEREN]].\n* * * * * * * Please adhere to the guidelines above when adding a name to this article. * * * * * * *\n\n--->\n{{TOC right}}\n\n==April==\n===16===\n\n===15===\n\n===14===\n*[[Pip Baker]], 91, British screenwriter (''[[Doctor Who]]''), complications from a fall.<ref>[http://www.doctorwhonews.net/2020/04/pip-baker-died-2020.html Pip Baker 1928 - 2020]</ref>\n*{{ill|Haydar Ba\u015f|tr}}, 73, Turkish politician, founder and leader of the [[Independent Turkey Party]] (since 2002), COVID-19.<ref>[https://ria.ru/20200414/1570015283.html \u041b\u0438\u0434\u0435\u0440 \u0442\u0443\u0440\u0435\u0446\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u043f\u0430\u0440\u0442\u0438\u0438 \u0443\u043c\u0435\u0440 \u043e\u0442 COVID-19] {{in lang|ru}}</ref>\n*[[Aldo de Cillo Pagotto]], 70, Brazilian Roman Catholic prelate, Bishop of [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Sobral|Sobral]] (1998\u20132004) and Archbishop of [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Para\u00edba|Para\u00edba]] (2004\u20132016).<ref>[http://www.catholic-hierarchy.org/bishop/bcilp.html Archbishop Aldo de Cillo Pagotto]</ref>\n*[[Miguel \u00c1ngel D'Annibale]], 61, Argentine Roman Catholic prelate, Bishop of [[Roman Catholic Diocese of R\u00edo Gallegos|R\u00edo Gallegos]] (2013\u20132018) and [[Roman Catholic Diocese of San Mart\u00edn|San Mart\u00edn]] (since 2018).<ref>[http://www.catholic-hierarchy.org/bishop/bdannim.html Bishop Miguel \u00c1ngel D\u2019Annibale]</ref>\n*{{ill|Franco Lauro|it}}, 58, Italian sports journalist, heart attack.<ref>[https://www.repubblica.it/sport/vari/2020/04/14/news/morto_giornalista_franco_lauro-254015435/ E' morto Franco Lauro, volto noto di Rai sport] {{in lang|it}}</ref>\n*[[Cyril Lawrence]], 99, English footballer ([[Rochdale A.F.C.|Rochdale]], [[Wrexham A.F.C.|Wrexham]]), COVID-19.<ref>[http://www.salfordstar.com/article.asp?id=5555 99 year old Salford man and ex-pro footballer beaten by coronavirus]</ref>\n*[[Kerstin Meyer]], 92, Swedish mezzo-soprano.<ref>[https://www.ystadsallehanda.se/nyheter/hovsangerskan-kerstin-meyer-dod/ Hovs\u00e5ngerskan Kerstin Meyer d\u00f6d] {{in lang| sv}}</ref>\n*[[Dean Parker]], 72\u201373, New Zealand screenwriter, playwright, journalist, and political commentator.<ref>[https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/national/414277/playwright-dean-parker-dies Playwright Dean Parker dies]</ref>\n*[[Markus Raetz]], 79, Swiss painter, sculptor, and illustrator.<ref>[https://www.rts.ch/play/radio/vertigo/audio/deces-de-markus-raetz?id=11210912 D\u00e9c\u00e8s de Markus Raetz] {{in lang|fr}}</ref>\n*[[C.

Do not place a period at the end of the entry. Names are reported under the date of death.

Include third-party sources other than the obituary.\n\n(3) Please add entries in alphabetical order by family name. Please avoid over-linking.

It has had different incarnation of a World Touring Car Cup held between 1993 and 1995. Following the 2017 season, an agreement was reached for the [[World Touring Car Championship]] to become WTCR and use the [[TCR Touring Car|TCR]] technical regulations. With titles for drivers and teams only, the WTCR series changed to 'World Cup' rather than 'World Championship' status in 2018.<ref>https://www.autosport.com/wtcc/news/133642/wtcr-keeps-wtcc-showpieces-on-2018-calendar</ref>\n\n==History==\n===Touring Car World Cup (1993\u20131995)===\n{{see also|1993 FIA Touring Car Challenge|1994 FIA Touring Car World Cup|1995 FIA Touring Car World Cup}}\nIn 1993, with the high popularity of the [[Super Touring]] category, the FIA hosted the FIA Touring Car World Cup&nbsp;\u2014 an annual event for touring car drivers hailing from national championships all over the world. The [[1993 FIA Touring Car Challenge|1993 race]] at [[Autodromo Nazionale Monza|Monza]] was won by New Zealand's [[Paul Radisich]], at the wheel of a [[Ford Mondeo]] ahead of [[Nicola Larini]]'s [[Alfa Romeo 155]], with no manufacturer title awarded. The race was run for two more years, (won by Paul Radisich again in [[1994 FIA Touring Car World Cup|1994]] at [[Donington Park]] in a Ford Mondeo, manufacturer title went to BMW, and [[Frank Biela]] in [[1995 FIA Touring Car World Cup|1995]] at [[Circuit Paul Ricard|Paul Ricard]] in an Audi A4 Quattro, and manufacturer title went to Audi). A similar event was planned for 1996 at the [[A1 Ring]], [[Austria]], but was cancelled due to a low number of provisional entries (10 cars). It was never brought back thereafter.\n\n=== World Touring Car Championship (2005\u20132017) ===\n{{see also|World Touring Car Championship}}\n\n=== World Touring Car Cup (2018\u2013present)===\nOn 6 December 2017, during the FIA's World Motorsport Council in Paris, it was approved the formation of the new World Touring Car Cup starting from 2018. The new series would utilize the TCR rules, which have been in use in numerous national and international touring car racing series, including [[TCR International Series]]. Cars would now have to conform to the new FIA WTCR regulations. As a result of the formation of the WTC Cup both the WTCC in its current format and the TCR International Series would be discontinued immediately.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.touringcartimes.com/2017/12/06/world-touring-car-cup-made-official-wtcc-tcr-combine-two-year-deal/|title=World Touring Car Cup made official as WTCC, TCR combine in two-year deal - TouringCarTimes|date=2017-12-06|work=TouringCarTimes|access-date=2017-12-06|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nA new format was introduced, with one qualifying session and one race on the first day and a three-phase qualifying session on the second day and two races, with the first one having the top 10 of the grid reversed.<ref>{{cite web |title=WTCR race format confirmed by the World Motor Sport Council |url=https://www.touringcartimes.com/2018/03/09/wtcr-race-format-confirmed-world-motor-sport-council/ |publisher=TouringCarTimes |accessdate=28 April 2019 |date=9 March 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=WTCR 2018: all you need to know |url=https://www.fiawtcr.com/wtcr-2018-all-you-need-to-know/ |publisher=FIA WTCR |accessdate=28 April 2019 |date=2 April 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Rules==\n===Car homologation===\nCars have to be production models, with a minimum production of 5000 samples in a year. \nThe engine is limited to a displacement of up to 2 liters, turbo charged, and with the aid of restrictors, to a maximum yield of 350 Hp.\nEach car is assigned a minimum racing weight which is used to [[TCR_Touring_Car#Technical_Regulations|balance the performances]].\n\n===Scoring system===\nFor the 2019 season, FIA WTCR races are awarded the following points, similar to [[Grand Prix motorcycle racing|MotoGP]] scoring system.:<ref name=\"Rules1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.touringcartimes.com/2018/12/05/32-car-limit-new-points-system-confirmed-2019-wtcr/|title=32 car limit and new points system confirmed for 2019 WTCR|date=2018-12-05|website=TouringCarTimes|language=en-US|access-date=2019-03-06}}</ref><ref name=\"Rules2\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.touringcartimes.com/2018/12/04/two-car-teams-introduced-points-system-overhauled-2019/|title=Two-car teams to be introduced and points system overhauled in 2019|date=2018-12-04|website=TouringCarTimes|language=en-US|access-date=2019-03-06}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:80%; text-align:center\"\n!

It has had different incarnation of a World Touring Car Cup held between 1993 and 1995. Following the 2017 season, an agreement was reached for the [[World Touring Car Championship]] to become WTCR and use the [[TCR Touring Car|TCR]] technical regulations. With titles for drivers and teams only, the WTCR series changed to 'World Cup' rather than 'World Championship' status in 2018.<ref>https://www.autosport.com/wtcc/news/133642/wtcr-keeps-wtcc-showpieces-on-2018-calendar</ref>\n\n==History==\n===Touring Car World Cup (1993\u20131995)===\n{{see also|1993 FIA Touring Car Challenge|1994 FIA Touring Car World Cup|1995 FIA Touring Car World Cup}}\nIn 1993, with the high popularity of the [[Super Touring]] category, the FIA hosted the FIA Touring Car World Cup&nbsp;\u2014 an annual event for touring car drivers hailing from national championships all over the world. The [[1993 FIA Touring Car Challenge|1993 race]] at [[Autodromo Nazionale Monza|Monza]] was won by New Zealand's [[Paul Radisich]], at the wheel of a [[Ford Mondeo]] ahead of [[Nicola Larini]]'s [[Alfa Romeo 155]], with no manufacturer title awarded. The race was run for two more years, (won by Paul Radisich again in [[1994 FIA Touring Car World Cup|1994]] at [[Donington Park]] in a Ford Mondeo, manufacturer title went to BMW, and [[Frank Biela]] in [[1995 FIA Touring Car World Cup|1995]] at [[Circuit Paul Ricard|Paul Ricard]] in an Audi A4 Quattro, and manufacturer title went to Audi). A similar event was planned for 1996 at the [[A1 Ring]], [[Austria]], but was cancelled due to a low number of provisional entries (10 cars). It was never brought back thereafter.\n\n=== World Touring Car Championship (2005\u20132017) ===\n{{see also|World Touring Car Championship}}\n\n=== World Touring Car Cup (2018\u2013present)===\nOn 6 December 2017, during the FIA's World Motorsport Council in Paris, it was approved the formation of the new World Touring Car Cup starting from 2018. The new series would utilize the TCR rules, which have been in use in numerous national and international touring car racing series, including [[TCR International Series]]. Cars would now have to conform to the new FIA WTCR regulations. As a result of the formation of the WTC Cup both the WTCC in its current format and the TCR International Series would be discontinued immediately.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.touringcartimes.com/2017/12/06/world-touring-car-cup-made-official-wtcc-tcr-combine-two-year-deal/|title=World Touring Car Cup made official as WTCC, TCR combine in two-year deal - TouringCarTimes|date=2017-12-06|work=TouringCarTimes|access-date=2017-12-06|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nA new format was introduced, with one qualifying session and one race on the first day and a three-phase qualifying session on the second day and two races, with the first one having the top 10 of the grid reversed.<ref>{{cite web |title=WTCR race format confirmed by the World Motor Sport Council |url=https://www.touringcartimes.com/2018/03/09/wtcr-race-format-confirmed-world-motor-sport-council/ |publisher=TouringCarTimes |accessdate=28 April 2019 |date=9 March 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=WTCR 2018: all you need to know |url=https://www.fiawtcr.com/wtcr-2018-all-you-need-to-know/ |publisher=FIA WTCR |accessdate=28 April 2019 |date=2 April 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Rules==\n===Car homologation===\nCars have to be production models, with a minimum production of 5000 samples in a year. \nThe engine is limited to a displacement of up to 2 liters, turbo charged, and with the aid of restrictors, to a maximum yield of 350 Hp.\nEach car is assigned a minimum racing weight which is used to [[TCR_Touring_Car#Technical_Regulations|balance the performances]].\n\n===Scoring system===\nFor the 2019 season, FIA WTCR races are awarded the following points, similar to [[Grand Prix motorcycle racing|MotoGP]] scoring system.:<ref name=\"Rules1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.touringcartimes.com/2018/12/05/32-car-limit-new-points-system-confirmed-2019-wtcr/|title=32 car limit and new points system confirmed for 2019 WTCR|date=2018-12-05|website=TouringCarTimes|language=en-US|access-date=2019-03-06}}</ref><ref name=\"Rules2\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.touringcartimes.com/2018/12/04/two-car-teams-introduced-points-system-overhauled-2019/|title=Two-car teams to be introduced and points system overhauled in 2019|date=2018-12-04|website=TouringCarTimes|language=en-US|access-date=2019-03-06}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:80%; text-align:center\"\n!

Having moved in prominent literary circles in London,{{sfn|Boase|1890|p=220}} she contracted [[tuberculosis]] and migrated in 1861 to South Africa for health reasons.<ref>Victorian Prose: An Anthology</ref> She travelled on to Egypt in 1862 where she settled in [[Luxor]], learnt Arabic, and wrote many letters about Egyptian culture, religion, and customs. Her letters are notable for humour, outrage at the ruling Ottomans, and many personal stories from the people around her.\n\n==Early life==\n[[File:Lucie Gordon (nee Austin) aged fifteen.jpg|thumb|A sketch by a school friend of Lucie Austin aged 15]]\nLucie was the only child of [[John Austin (legal philosopher)|John Austin]] (1790\u20131859), a [[jurist]], and his wife [[Sarah Austin (author)|Sarah Austin]], a translator. She was born in [[Queen Anne's Gate|Queen Square, Westminster]] on 24 June 1821, where her chief playfellows were her first cousin [[Henry Reeve (journalist)|Henry Reeve]], and [[John Stuart Mill]]. As she grew in vigour and in sense, she developed a strong tinge of originality and independence, with a marked love of animals.{{sfn|Boase|1890|p=220}}\n\nIn 1826 she went with her parents to [[Bonn]] on the Rhine, and stayed sufficiently long to return speaking German as if it were her own language. She had scant regular instruction, but was for a short time at a mixed school of boys and girls kept by [[George Edward Biber]] at Hampstead, where she learnt Latin.

They were all essentially softcore, and we decided to make a kind of send-up of one, really. Not because we wanted to do a send-up, but because we didn't think we wanted to do a genuine one.

In fact, as I recall, we had the police call in on more than one occasion while we were shooting, just to make sure we weren't doing hardcore.

It was followed by a sequel, ''[[Fantasm Comes Again]]'', the following year, directed by a pseudonymous [[Colin Eggleston]].\n\n==Plot==\nGerman psychiatrist Professor Jurgen Notafreud takes the audience through a series of female sexual fantasies including:\n*sex in a beauty salon\n*fruit fetishism\n*lesbianism in a sauna\n*teacher student seduction\n*rape in a gym\n*transvestism\n*reverse [[Oedipus complex]] ([[Electra complex]])\n\n==Cast==\n*Dee Dee Levitt as Abby\n*Maria Arnold as Barbara\n*Bill Margold as husband\n*Gretchen Gayle as Gabrielle\n*[[Rene Bond]] as Dianne\n*Al Williams as rapist\n*Con Covert as transvestite\n*Mara Lutra as Felicity\n*[[Uschi Digart]] as Super Girl\n*Maria Welton as Irish\n*[[John Holmes (pornographic actor)|John Holmes]] as Neptune\n*Mary Gavin (Candy Samples) as Belle\n*Gene Allan Poe as son\n*Robert Savage as visitor 1\n*Kirby Hall as visitor 2\n*Shayne as Celeste\n*Sue Doloria as Harriet\n*Al Ward as teacher\n*Clement St George as Satanist\n*Serena as victim\n*[[John Bluthal]] as Professor Jurgen Notafreud\n\n==Production==\nIn 1974 and 1975 Antony I Ginnane decided to enter the production field. He attempted to set up a [[Roger Corman]] type \"nurses\" film which he would produce and direct budgeted at $250,000 and then a crime drama set against the background of the massage parlour business called ''Sexy Little Me'' budgeted at $150,000, but was unable to find the money. However he could raise $50,000 and allocated directing duties to Richard Franklin, with whom Ginnane had worked with on the overseas marketing for ''[[The True Story of Eskimo Nell]]''.<ref name=\"ginnane\"/>\n\nFranklin and Ginnane wanted to make something commercial so their options were a bikie, horror or sex film. They decided to make a sex film with Franklin pushing to make it more of a comedy. [[Ross Dimsey]] wrote a script, originally called ''Fantale'', which was a send up of Swedish sex education films such as  ''[[Language of Love]]''.<ref name=\"ginnane\"/> Franklin:\n<blockquote>With this thin veneer of medical 'therapy', or whatever, these films were being shown in these little underground cinemas and so on around the place. They were all essentially softcore, and we decided to make a kind of send-up of one, really. Not because we wanted to do a send-up, but because we didn't think we wanted to do a genuine one. We just wanted to make a fun film about sex!<ref name=\"trash\">{{cite magazine|url=http://mondostumpo.blogspot.com.au/2007/11/richard-franklin-interview-2002.html |title=Richard Franklin & Eskimo Nell |work=Eros Magazine |volume=3 |number=1 |year=2003 |location=Canberra |accessdate=2014-11-19}}</ref></blockquote>\nGinnane and Franklin had trouble finding actors who would appear in the film in Australia so only the  linking scenes with the professor were shot in that country, with the sex scenes filmed in Los Angeles by Franklin and his cinematographer Vince Monton, using American porn stars.<ref name=\"pike\"/> An old classmate of Franklin's from USC, Doug Knapp, was working in the area of porn and put them in touch with casting agent Bill Margold.\n\nThe US shoot took ten days, the Australian shoot took one day.<ref name=\"stratton\">{{cite book|first=David |last=Stratton |title=The Last New Wave: The Australian Film Revival |url=https://archive.org/details/lastnewwaveaustr0000stra |url-access=registration |publisher=Angus & Robertson |year=1980 |page=[https://archive.org/details/lastnewwaveaustr0000stra/page/250 250]}}</ref> Franklin says that John Bluthal, who played the professor, ad-libbed some of his dialogue, and that the porn actors were paid around $200 a day, except for John Holmes who was paid around $400 a day.<ref name=\"trash\"/> Franklin:\n<blockquote>That was an era where hardcore was NOT being produced in L.A. In fact, as I recall, we had the police call in on more than one occasion while we were shooting, just to make sure we weren't doing hardcore. But I was told, and I guess it would be evident if you studied the films of the era, but virtually all of the actors did hardcore work, but they did that in San Francisco or in Europe. But it was just a short period when hardcore porn was not\u2026 There was no problem shooting what they call T and A, tits and arse, but you weren't allowed to have people fucking on the set.<ref name=\"trash\"/></blockquote>\nDespite the presence of American actors, Franklin says it was always his intention that the film be made primarily for the Australian market.<ref name=\"trash\"/>\n\n==Reception==\nAlthough the movie was entirely soft core, around 45 seconds were cut out by the Australian censor prior to release. It was originally banned completely in the UK by the [[BBFC]] and is still only available with heavy cuts.<ref name=\"trash\"/>\n\nThe film was extremely popular at the box office and by 1979 had taken approximately $650,000 in Australia, despite being banned in Queensland.<ref name=\"ginnane\"/> It led to a sequel ''[[Fantasm Comes Again]]'' (1977).<ref name=\"pike\"/>\n\nFranklin says its success enabled him to get financing for ''[[Patrick_(1978_film) | Patrick]]''.\n<blockquote>Even though I had done it under a pseudonym, it was perceived that I could make films that would make money... I usually don't list it in my filmography, not because I'm ashamed to have done it - I don't know whether [[Francis Ford Coppola|Coppola]] lists [[Tonight for Sure|HIS in his filmography]]! - but because it was such a low budget thing, and done in as I recall ten or eleven days, so it was really just like a series of student films strung together, if that makes sense. So I don't really, even though it runs feature length, I don't sort of think of it as a feature film.<ref name=\"trash\"/></blockquote>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{IMDb title|0072969}}\n*[http://www.ozmovies.com.au/movie/fantasm ''Fantasm''] at Oz Movies\n\n{{Richard Franklin}}\n\n[[Category:1976 films]]\n[[Category:Australian films]]\n[[Category:English-language films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Richard Franklin (director)]]\n[[Category:1970s pornographic films]]\n", "name_user": "Moe1810", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fantasm"}
