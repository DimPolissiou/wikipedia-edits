They provide original songs and harmonies, strung together by comic banter.\n\n== History ==\n\n===Live shows===\nTripod emerged from the thriving Melbourne live music pub scene of the mid nineties, supporting popular local cover bands in such places as the Station Hotel, [[Esplanade Hotel (Melbourne)|The Esplanade]], the Central Club, the New Orleans Tavern and the Ritz, St Kilda. They were very much a cover band at first, performing three part harmony versions on hits by the likes of [[Elvis Costello]], [[David Bowie|Bowie]], [[the Beach Boys]] and [[Queen (band)|Queen]]. Prior to this they did their time as buskers in Melbourne malls with a far-fetched prop act of which no record exists. They garnered a local following via regular residencies at the Commercial Hotel, Yarraville, just after it stopped being a biker bar.\n\nThey soon became regulars at the Prince Patrick Hotel in [[Collingwood, Victoria|Collingwood]], a Melbourne comedy venue, where they honed their skills in residencies and appearances from 1998 through to its demise in 2003.<ref>[http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2003/01/28/1043534054339.htm ''The Age'' newspaper],</ref>\n\nTripod are stalwarts of their home festival, the [[Melbourne International Comedy Festival]], where they often performed since 1997, when they took their pub act and jammed it into a one-hour festival format at [[St Martins Youth Arts Centre]], in a show entitled ''Welcome to My Wonderwall''. They have appeared on music festival stages including the [[Falls Festival]], the [[Port Fairy Folk Festival]], the [[Queenscliff Music Festival]] and the [[Woodford Folk Festival]].\n\nTripod have appeared internationally, including the Montreal [[Just for Laughs|Just For Laughs]] festival and the [[Upright Citizens Brigade Theatre|Upright Citizens Brigade]] theatre in New York and Los Angeles. They have played the [[Edinburgh Festival Fringe|Edinburgh Fringe]] numerous times.\n\nThey have also toured the Australian rural countryside including long stints with the MICF Roadshow.\n\nTripod alternate the form of their shows between the song-and-sketch cabaret gig format (such as ''Self Saucing'' and ''Men of Substance'') and narrative musicals. Their first \"story\" show was ''Tripod Tells the Tale of the Adventures of Tosswinkle the Pirate (not very well)'', which premiered at the MICF before touring nationally.\n\nTheir narrative show, ''Lady Robots'', was first previewed at the 2002 Adelaide Fringe Festival before it was performed at the [[MICF]] later that year. The show was a musical comedy telling the story of three men who are hurled into space where they come across a planet populated only by Lady Robots. Tripod performed a re-jigged version of the show, ''Lady Robots v1.1'' at the [[Melbourne Athenaeum|Athenaeum Theatre]] at the Melbourne International Comedy Festival in 2005, before a national tour culminating in a hit season at the [[Sydney Opera House]]. No recordings are known to exist.\n\nOn 30 January 2010, Tripod held the world premiere of their comedic musical ''Tripod versus the Dragon'' at the [[Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art]] in North Adams, Massachusetts, United States. [[Elana Stone]] co-starred in the production in the role of \"The Dungeon Master\"/\"Dragon\" after [[Megan Washington]], who had been co-writing songs for the production, declined the role due to scheduling conflicts. The production is based on the [[Dungeons and Dragons]] [[role-playing game]].<ref>[http://www.massmoca.org/event_details.php?id=522 MASS MoCA Event page for Tripod versus the Dragon] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719030702/http://www.massmoca.org/event_details.php?id=522 |date=19 July 2011 }}</ref> Tripod went on to perform this show at the Adelaide Fringe Festival, Melbourne International Comedy Festival, the Sydney Opera House, and the Edinburgh Fringe Festival in 2010, as well as subsequent seasons in Perth, Brisbane, regional Victoria and the Przeglad Piosenki Aktorskiej festival in [[Wroc\u0142aw|Wroclaw]], Poland.\n\nIn January 2013, Tripod joined forces with Australian performer [[Eddie Perfect]] to create ''Perfect Tripod'', a show of classic Australian songs arranged in four-part harmony, inspired by their cover of ''Meet Me in the Middle of the Air'' performed on ''[[The Sideshow]]'' on 13 October 2007. Perfect Tripod toured concert halls throughout the nation and have collaborated with such Australian pop music greats as [[Gotye]] and [[Missy Higgins]].\n\nIn October 2014, Tripod performed live at the international gaming convention, [[Penny Arcade Expo|PAX (Penny Arcade Expo)]], in Melbourne at the [[Melbourne Convention and Exhibition Centre]]. There they performed a short preview of ''This Gaming Life'', an original collaboration between Tripod, Grammy nominated composer [[Austin Wintory]] and the [[Melbourne Symphony Orchestra]].\n\nIn 2015 ''This Gaming Life'' played to rapturous houses at [[Hamer Hall, Melbourne|Hamer Hall]], Victorian Arts Centre, with a 55 piece orchestra conducted and arranged by Wintory. The show was a full scale two-act orchestral love letter to the culture and relationships of passionate video gamers, and has been described as the \"Stand By Me of the gamer generation.\"{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}\n\n===TV===\nThe band got their first break appearing on ''[[Hey Hey It's Saturday]]''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s \"[[Red Faces]]\" contest, where they performed a parodic medley of [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]] hits that demonstrated similarities between the songs.<ref>[http://everguide.com.au/entertainment/comedy/interview/seven-unusual-things-happening-to-tripod.aspx Seven Unusual Things Happening to Tripod], \"Everguide.com\", 5 April 2013</ref>\n\nTheir first regular TV appearances were on ''[[In Melbourne Tonight]]'' (IMT) with [[Frankie J.

In it they had one hour to write and arrange a coherent song based on incoherent listener suggestions and then perform said song to an eager national audience.

In late 2005, they moved to [[FOX FM (Melbourne)|Fox FM]] where they could be heard on [[Peter Helliar]]'s weekly Friday morning show, ''Pete's Show''.\n\n=== Podcast ===\nOn December 24, 2015 Tripod along with host Andrew Pogson started a regular podcast titled [http://3pod.com.au/site/category/podcast/ Perfectly Good Podcast.] Initially started to promote their upcoming [http://3pod.com.au/site/101-tripod-hits/ 101 Tripod Hits] tour, the ongoing series shifted its focus covering any number of topic including current themes or stories from Tripod's 20+ years together. Each podcast centers around a theme in which host Andrew Pogson attempts to keep the members of Tripod to. Tripod also play live or play recordings of there songs which loosely relate to the episode's theme.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Perfectly Good Podcast Song Appearances\n!101 Hits #\n!Song\n!From\n!Episode Song Appearances\n|-\n|1\n|'''A Shandy Too Far'''\n|Box Set  - 1996\n|[http://3pod.com.au/site/episode-22-perfectly-good-podcast-parties/ Episode 22] (Live)\n|-\n|2\n|'''Adult Contemporary'''\n|Men of Substance - 2013\n|[http://3pod.com.au/site/episode-2-perfectly-good-podcast/ Episode 2] (Live)\n|-\n|3\n|'''Air Guitar'''\n|The Sideshow - 2007\n|[http://3pod.com.au/site/episode-53-perfectly-good-podcast-cool/ Episode 53] (live)\n|-\n|4\n|'''All I Want'''\n|This Gaming Life - 2015\n|[http://3pod.com.au/site/episode-33-perfectly-good-podcast-love-want/ Episode 33] (Live) - featuring Poggo as electric guitar solo via mouth\n|-\n|5\n|'''Ancestors'''\n|1999\n|[http://3pod.com.au/site/episode-7-perfectly-good-podcast-family/ Episode 7] (Live) -  a cappella style\n|-\n|6\n|'''Aquaman'''\n|Perfectly Good Songs - 2007\n|[http://3pod.com.au/site/episdoe-27-perfectly-good-podcast-heroes/ Episode 27] (Live) - Guitar solo acoustic\n|-\n|7\n|'''Astronaut'''\n|Middleborough  Road - 2004\n|[http://3pod.com.au/site/episode-2-perfectly-good-podcast/ Episode 2] (Live)\n|-\n|8\n|'''Ballad of Ronnie'''\n|How to Train an Attack Dog from Scratch - 2007\n|[http://3pod.com.au/site/episdoe-27-perfectly-good-podcast-heroes/ Episode 27] (Live)\n|-\n|9\n|'''Bard'''\n|Tripod Versus the Dragon - 2010\n|[http://3pod.com.au/site/episode-2-perfectly-good-podcast/ Episode 2] (Live) - featuring Yon on Trumpet (with an error and scream), Differences:  No Elana Stone\n|-\n|10\n|'''The Blueprint'''\n|Men of  Substance - 2013\n|[http://3pod.com.au/site/ep-8-perfectly-good-podcast-melbourne/ Episode 8] (Live)\n|-\n|11\n|'''Boggyman'''\n|About an Hour of Song-In-An-Hour...Again - 2003\n|[http://3pod.com.au/site/episode-16-perfectly-good-podcast-songs-in-an-hour/ Episode 16] (Recording) - Album version\n|-\n|12\n|'''Bubble Helicopter'''\n|Tripod Tells the Tale of the Adventures of Tosswinkle the Pirate (Not Very Well) -  2001\n|[http://3pod.com.au/site/episode-55-perfectly-good-podcast-not-knowing-stuff/ Episode 55] (Live)\n|-\n|13\n|'''Building an Enid'''\n|Tripod Tells the Tale of the Adventures of Tosswinkle the Pirate (Not Very Well) -  2001\n|\n|-\n|14\n|'''Change a Thing'''\n|Monster Beach - 2014\n|[http://3pod.com.au/site/episode-28-perfectly-good-podcast-money/ Episode 28] (Live)\n|-\n|15\n|'''Christ is Born'''\n|For the Love of God!

They recorded a live album of the show in April 2006 entitled ''[[Songs from Self Saucing]]'', recorded and mixed by regular collaborator Nao Anzai, which was nominated for Best Comedy Release at the 2007 [[Australian Recording Industry Association|ARIA]] awards.\n\nTripod's first DVD was also released in 2006: a live recording of their 2005 show \"[[Pod August Night|POD August Nights]]\". The DVD includes numerous special features including a music video for their song \"Gonna Make You Happy Tonight\" from their 2004 album, ''Middleborough Rd''. Tripod's 2001 show, \"''Tripod tells the tale of the Adventures of Tosswinkle the Pirate (Not Very Well)''\" was also released on DVD in 2006, following the original 2001 VHS release.\n\nTripod released a Christmas album in 2010, an album of original material from their much loved Xmas shows, entitled ''For the Love of God'', and toured nationally with the songs, performing in the Sydney Opera House that year.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.smartartists.com.au/media/tripod_bio_2009.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-12-09 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140124182726/http://www.smartartists.com.au/media/tripod_bio_2009.pdf |archivedate=24 January 2014 |df=dmy-all }}, 2009</ref>\n\nIn 2009, Tripod released a DVD of a live performance at the [[Woodford Folk Festival]].

They provide original songs and harmonies, strung together by comic banter.\n\n== History ==\n\n===Live shows===\nTripod emerged from the thriving Melbourne live music pub scene of the mid nineties, supporting popular local cover bands in such places as the Station Hotel, [[Esplanade Hotel (Melbourne)|The Esplanade]], the Central Club, the New Orleans Tavern and the Ritz, St Kilda. They were very much a cover band at first, performing three part harmony versions on hits by the likes of [[Elvis Costello]], [[David Bowie|Bowie]], [[the Beach Boys]] and [[Queen (band)|Queen]]. Prior to this they did their time as buskers in Melbourne malls with a far-fetched prop act of which no record exists. They garnered a local following via regular residencies at the Commercial Hotel, Yarraville, just after it stopped being a biker bar.\n\nThey soon became regulars at the Prince Patrick Hotel in [[Collingwood, Victoria|Collingwood]], a Melbourne comedy venue, where they honed their skills in residencies and appearances from 1998 through to its demise in 2003.<ref>[http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2003/01/28/1043534054339.htm ''The Age'' newspaper],</ref>\n\nTripod are stalwarts of their home festival, the [[Melbourne International Comedy Festival]], where they often performed since 1997, when they took their pub act and jammed it into a one-hour festival format at [[St Martins Youth Arts Centre]], in a show entitled ''Welcome to My Wonderwall''. They have appeared on music festival stages including the [[Falls Festival]], the [[Port Fairy Folk Festival]], the [[Queenscliff Music Festival]] and the [[Woodford Folk Festival]].\n\nTripod have appeared internationally, including the Montreal [[Just for Laughs|Just For Laughs]] festival and the [[Upright Citizens Brigade Theatre|Upright Citizens Brigade]] theatre in New York and Los Angeles. They have played the [[Edinburgh Festival Fringe|Edinburgh Fringe]] numerous times.\n\nThey have also toured the Australian rural countryside including long stints with the MICF Roadshow.\n\nTripod alternate the form of their shows between the song-and-sketch cabaret gig format (such as ''Self Saucing'' and ''Men of Substance'') and narrative musicals. Their first \"story\" show was ''Tripod Tells the Tale of the Adventures of Tosswinkle the Pirate (not very well)'', which premiered at the MICF before touring nationally.\n\nTheir narrative show, ''Lady Robots'', was first previewed at the 2002 Adelaide Fringe Festival before it was performed at the [[MICF]] later that year. The show was a musical comedy telling the story of three men who are hurled into space where they come across a planet populated only by Lady Robots. Tripod performed a re-jigged version of the show, ''Lady Robots v1.1'' at the [[Melbourne Athenaeum|Athenaeum Theatre]] at the Melbourne International Comedy Festival in 2005, before a national tour culminating in a hit season at the [[Sydney Opera House]]. No recordings are known to exist.\n\nOn 30 January 2010, Tripod held the world premiere of their comedic musical ''Tripod versus the Dragon'' at the [[Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art]] in North Adams, Massachusetts, United States. [[Elana Stone]] co-starred in the production in the role of \"The Dungeon Master\"/\"Dragon\" after [[Megan Washington]], who had been co-writing songs for the production, declined the role due to scheduling conflicts. The production is based on the [[Dungeons and Dragons]] [[role-playing game]].<ref>[http://www.massmoca.org/event_details.php?id=522 MASS MoCA Event page for Tripod versus the Dragon] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719030702/http://www.massmoca.org/event_details.php?id=522 |date=19 July 2011 }}</ref> Tripod went on to perform this show at the Adelaide Fringe Festival, Melbourne International Comedy Festival, the Sydney Opera House, and the Edinburgh Fringe Festival in 2010, as well as subsequent seasons in Perth, Brisbane, regional Victoria and the Przeglad Piosenki Aktorskiej festival in [[Wroc\u0142aw|Wroclaw]], Poland.\n\nIn January 2013, Tripod joined forces with Australian performer [[Eddie Perfect]] to create ''Perfect Tripod'', a show of classic Australian songs arranged in four-part harmony, inspired by their cover of ''Meet Me in the Middle of the Air'' performed on ''[[The Sideshow]]'' on 13 October 2007. Perfect Tripod toured concert halls throughout the nation and have collaborated with such Australian pop music greats as [[Gotye]] and [[Missy Higgins]].\n\nIn October 2014, Tripod performed live at the international gaming convention, [[Penny Arcade Expo|PAX (Penny Arcade Expo)]], in Melbourne at the [[Melbourne Convention and Exhibition Centre]]. There they performed a short preview of ''This Gaming Life'', an original collaboration between Tripod, Grammy nominated composer [[Austin Wintory]] and the [[Melbourne Symphony Orchestra]].\n\nIn 2015 ''This Gaming Life'' played to rapturous houses at [[Hamer Hall, Melbourne|Hamer Hall]], Victorian Arts Centre, with a 55 piece orchestra conducted and arranged by Wintory.

They recorded a live album of the show in April 2006 entitled ''[[Songs from Self Saucing]]'', recorded and mixed by regular collaborator Nao Anzai, which was nominated for Best Comedy Release at the 2007 [[Australian Recording Industry Association|ARIA]] awards.\n\nTripod's first DVD was also released in 2006: a live recording of their 2005 show \"[[Pod August Night|POD August Nights]]\". The DVD includes numerous special features including a music video for their song \"Gonna Make You Happy Tonight\" from their 2004 album, ''Middleborough Rd''. Tripod's 2001 show, \"''Tripod tells the tale of the Adventures of Tosswinkle the Pirate (Not Very Well)''\" was also released on DVD in 2006, following the original 2001 VHS release.\n\nTripod released a Christmas album in 2010, an album of original material from their much loved Xmas shows, entitled ''For the Love of God'', and toured nationally with the songs, performing in the Sydney Opera House that year.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.smartartists.com.au/media/tripod_bio_2009.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-12-09 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140124182726/http://www.smartartists.com.au/media/tripod_bio_2009.pdf |archivedate=24 January 2014 |df=dmy-all }}, 2009</ref>\n\nIn 2009, Tripod released a DVD of a live performance at the [[Woodford Folk Festival]].
