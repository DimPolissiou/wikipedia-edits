Italy won their third Olympic title at the [[Water polo at the 1992 Summer Olympics|1992 Summer Olympics]] in [[Barcelona]], [[Spain]], beating the hosts and tournament favourites [[Spain men's national water polo team|Spain]] 9\u20138 after extra time in a thrilling final. Only [[Hungary men's national water polo team|Hungary]] (9), and Great Britain (4) have more Olympic titles.\n\nThe Italian national side have also won four World Championships, in [[1978 FINA Men's World Water Polo Championship|1978]], [[1994 FINA Men's World Water Polo Championship|1994]], [[Water polo at the 2011 World Aquatics Championships \u2013 Men's tournament|2011]] and [[Water polo at the 2019 World Aquatics Championships \u2013 Men's tournament|2019]], and the World Cup once in [[1993 FINA Men's Water Polo World Cup|1993]].

Italy won their third Olympic title at the [[Water polo at the 1992 Summer Olympics|1992 Summer Olympics]] in [[Barcelona]], [[Spain]], beating the hosts and tournament favourites [[Spain men's national water polo team|Spain]] 9\u20138 after extra time in a thrilling final. Only [[Hungary men's national water polo team|Hungary]] (9), and Great Britain (4) have more Olympic titles.\n\nThe Italian national side have also won four World Championships, in [[1978 FINA Men's World Water Polo Championship|1978]], [[1994 FINA Men's World Water Polo Championship|1994]], [[Water polo at the 2011 World Aquatics Championships \u2013 Men's tournament|2011]] and [[Water polo at the 2019 World Aquatics Championships \u2013 Men's tournament|2019]], and the World Cup once in [[1993 FINA Men's Water Polo World Cup|1993]].

In many types of esophageal atresia, a feeding tube will not pass through the esophagus.\n\n===Classification===\nThis condition takes several different forms, often involving one or more [[fistula]]s connecting the [[vertebrate trachea|trachea]] to the [[esophagus]] ([[tracheoesophageal fistula]]).\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The most immediate and effective treatment in the majority of cases is a surgical repair to close the fistula/s and reconnect the two ends of the esophagus to each other. Although this is usually done through an incision between the ribs on right side of the baby, a technique using three small incisions (thoracoscopy) is being used at some centers.\n\nIn a minority of cases, the gap between upper and lower esophageal segments may be too long to bridge. In these situations traditional surgical approaches include gastrostomy followed by gastric pull-up, colonic transposition and jejunum transposition.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.childrenshospital.org/clinicalservices/Site2807/mainpageS2807P23.html |title=Esophageal Atresia Treatment Program |publisher=Children\u2019s Hospital Boston |accessdate=1 June 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120229204332/http://www.childrenshospital.org/clinicalservices/Site2807/mainpageS2807P23.html |archive-date=29 February 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Gastric pull-up has been the preferred approach at many specialized centers, including Great Ormond Street (London) and Mott Children's Hospital (Ann Arbor).<ref name=\"Hirschl2002\">{{Cite journal | last1 = Hirschl | first1 = R.

Often a cervical esophagostomy will also be done, to allow the saliva which is swallowed to drain out a hole in the neck. Months or years later, the esophagus may be repaired, sometimes by using a segment of bowel brought up into the chest, interposing between the upper and lower segments of esophagus.\n\nIn some of these so-called long gap cases, though, an advanced surgical treatment developed by John Foker, MD,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.childrenshospital.org/az/Site1775/mainpageS1775P0.html |title=Esophageal atresia - symptoms, tests, Foker treatment |publisher=Children\u2019s Hospital Boston |accessdate=1 June 2012}}</ref> may be utilized to elongate and then join together the short esophageal segments. Using the Foker technique, surgeons place traction sutures in the tiny esophageal ends and increase the tension on these sutures daily until the ends are close enough to be sewn together. The result is a normally functioning esophagus, virtually indistinguishable from one congenitally well formed. Unfortunately, the results have been somewhat difficult to replicate by other surgeons and the need for multiple operations has tempered enthusiasm for this approach. The optimal treatment in cases of long gap esophageal atresia remains controversial.<ref name=\"Kunisaki2012\">{{Cite journal | last1 = Kunisaki | first1 = S. M. | last2 = Foker | first2 = J.

This method does not require replacing the missing section with grafts of the intestine or other body parts. Using electromagnetic force to attract the upper and lower ends of the esophagus together was first tried in the 1970s by using steel pellets attracted to each other by applying external electromagnets to the patient. In the 2000s a further refinement was developed by [[Mario Zaritzky]]'s group and others. The newer method uses permanent magnets and a balloon.\n# The magnets are inserted into the upper pouch via the baby's mouth or nose, and the lower via the gastrotomy feeding tube hole (which would have had to be made anyway to feed the baby, therefore not requiring any additional surgery).\n# The distance between the magnets is controlled by a balloon in the upper pouch, between the end of the pouch and the magnet. This also controls the force between the magnets so it is not strong enough to cause damage. \n# After the ends of the esophagus have stretched enough to touch, the upper magnet is replaced by one without a balloon and the stronger magnetic attraction causes the ends to fuse ([[anastomosis]]).<ref name=\"wral.com\"/><ref>http://radiology.uchicago.edu/news/dr-zaritzky-pioneers-non-surgical-option-babies-esophageal-atresia</ref><ref>http://web.mit.edu/2.75/projects/DMD2011-5231.pdf</ref><ref>{{cite journal | doi=10.1016/j.epsc.2014.03.004 | volume=2 | issue=4 | title=Staged repair of esophageal atresia: Pouch approximation and catheter-based magnetic anastomosis | journal=Journal of Pediatric Surgery Case Reports | pages=170\u2013175| year=2014 | last1=Lovvorn | first1=Harold N. | last2=Baron | first2=Christopher M. | last3=Danko | first3=Melissa E. | last4=Novotny | first4=Nathan M. | last5=Bucher | first5=Brian T. | last6=Johnston | first6=Krystal K. | last7=Zaritzky | first7=Mario F. }}</ref>\n\nIn April 2015 [[Annalise Dapo]] became the first patient in the United States to have their esophageal atresia corrected using magnets.<ref name=\"wral.com\">http://www.wral.com/pioneering-wakemed-procedure-corrects-infant-s-rare-disorder/14573393/#/vid14573546</ref><ref name=\"abc11.com\">http://abc11.com/health/new-non-invasive-procedure-for-infant-at-wakemed-is-first-of-its-kind-in-us/648350/</ref>\n\n==Complications==\n===Treatment complications===\nPost operative [[Complications (medical)|complications]] may include a leak at the site of closure of the esophagus. Sometimes a stricture, or tight spot, will develop in the esophagus, making it difficult to swallow. Esophageal stricture can usually be dilated using medical instruments. In later life, most children with this disorder will have some trouble with either swallowing or heartburn or both. Esophageal dismotility occurs in 75-100% of patients. After esophageal repair ([[anastomosis]]) the relative flaccidity of former proximal pouch (blind pouch, above) along with esophageal dysmotility can cause fluid buildup during feeding. Owing to proximity, pouch ballooning can cause tracheal occlusion. Severe hypoxia (\"dying spells\") follows and medical intervention can often be required.\n\n===Other related complications===\n[[Tracheomalacia]] a softening of the trachea, usually above the carina ([[carina of trachea]]), but sometimes extensive in the lower bronchial tree as well\u2014is another possible serious complication. A variety of treatments for tracheomalacia associated with esophageal atresia are available. If not severe, the condition can be managed expectantly since the trachea will usually stiffen as the infant matures into the first year of life.  When only the trachea above the carina is compromised, one of the \"simplest\" interventions is [[aortopexy]] wherein the aortic loop is attached to the rear of the sternum, thereby mechanically relieving pressure from the softened trachea.  An even simpler intervention is stenting.  However, epithelial cell proliferation and potential incorporation of the stent into the trachea can make subsequent removal dangerous.\n\nThe incidence of asthma, bronchitis, bronchial hyperresponsiveness, and recurrent infections in adolescent and adult esophageal atresia survivors far exceeds that of their healthy peers.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite journal | author = Sistonen S, Malmberg P, Malmstr\u00f6m K | display-authors = etal | year = 2010 | title = Repaired oesophageal atresia: respiratory morbidity and pulmonary function in adults | url = | journal = Eur Respir J | volume = 36 | issue = 05| pages = 1106\u20131112 }}</ref> During the first decade of surgical repair of EA, as much as 20% of patients succumbed to [[pneumonia]].

Instead, it ends as a blind pouch. [[Tracheoesophageal fistula]] (TEF) represents an abnormal opening between the trachea and esophagus. EA and TEF can occur separately or together. EA and TEF are diagnosed in the [[Intensive care unit|ICU]] at birth and treated immediately.\n\nThe presence of EA is suspected in an infant with excessive salivation (drooling) and in a newborn with drooling that is frequently accompanied by choking, coughing and sneezing. When fed, these infants swallow normally but begin to cough and struggle as the fluid returns through the nose and mouth. The infant may become cyanotic (turn bluish due to lack of oxygen) and may stop breathing as the overflow of fluid from the blind pouch is aspirated (sucked into) the trachea. The cyanosis is a result of laryngospasm (a protective mechanism that the body has to prevent aspiration into the trachea). Over time respiratory distress will develop.\n\nIf any of the above signs/symptoms are noticed, a catheter is gently passed into the esophagus to check for resistance. If resistance is noted, other studies will be done to confirm the diagnosis. A catheter can be inserted and will show up as white on a regular x-ray film to demonstrate the blind pouch ending. Sometimes a small amount of [[barium sulfate|barium]] (chalk-like liquid) is placed through the mouth to diagnose the problems.\n\nTreatment of EA and TEF is surgery to repair the defect. If EA or TEF is suspected, all oral feedings are stopped and intravenous fluids are started. The infant will be positioned to help drain secretions and decrease the likelihood of aspiration. Babies with EA may sometimes have other problems. Studies will be done to look at the heart, spine and kidneys.\n\nSurgery to repair EA is essential as the baby will not be able to feed and is highly likely to develop pneumonia. Once the baby is in condition for surgery, an incision is made on the side of the chest. The esophagus can usually be sewn together. Following surgery, the baby may be hospitalized for a variable length of time. Care for each infant is individualized.\n\nIts very commonly seen in a newborn with [[imperforate anus]].\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n*{{cite book|author1=Harmon C.M. |author2=Coran A.G. | title=''Congenital anomalies of the esophagus''.

However, these findings have a low positive predictive value. The upper neck pouch sign is another sign that helps in the antenatal diagnosis of esophageal atresia and it may be detected soon after birth as the affected infant will be unable to swallow its own [[saliva]].  Also, the newborn can present with gastric distention, cough, apnea, tachypnea, and cyanosis. In many types of esophageal atresia, a feeding tube will not pass through the esophagus.\n\n===Classification===\nThis condition takes several different forms, often involving one or more [[fistula]]s connecting the [[vertebrate trachea|trachea]] to the [[esophagus]] ([[tracheoesophageal fistula]]).\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The most immediate and effective treatment in the majority of cases is a surgical repair to close the fistula/s and reconnect the two ends of the esophagus to each other. Although this is usually done through an incision between the ribs on right side of the baby, a technique using three small incisions (thoracoscopy) is being used at some centers.\n\nIn a minority of cases, the gap between upper and lower esophageal segments may be too long to bridge. In these situations traditional surgical approaches include gastrostomy followed by gastric pull-up, colonic transposition and jejunum transposition.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.childrenshospital.org/clinicalservices/Site2807/mainpageS2807P23.html |title=Esophageal Atresia Treatment Program |publisher=Children\u2019s Hospital Boston |accessdate=1 June 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120229204332/http://www.childrenshospital.org/clinicalservices/Site2807/mainpageS2807P23.html |archive-date=29 February 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Gastric pull-up has been the preferred approach at many specialized centers, including Great Ormond Street (London) and Mott Children's Hospital (Ann Arbor).<ref name=\"Hirschl2002\">{{Cite journal | last1 = Hirschl | first1 = R.

Often a cervical esophagostomy will also be done, to allow the saliva which is swallowed to drain out a hole in the neck. Months or years later, the esophagus may be repaired, sometimes by using a segment of bowel brought up into the chest, interposing between the upper and lower segments of esophagus.\n\nIn some of these so-called long gap cases, though, an advanced surgical treatment developed by John Foker, MD,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.childrenshospital.org/az/Site1775/mainpageS1775P0.html |title=Esophageal atresia - symptoms, tests, Foker treatment |publisher=Children\u2019s Hospital Boston |accessdate=1 June 2012}}</ref> may be utilized to elongate and then join together the short esophageal segments. Using the Foker technique, surgeons place traction sutures in the tiny esophageal ends and increase the tension on these sutures daily until the ends are close enough to be sewn together. The result is a normally functioning esophagus, virtually indistinguishable from one congenitally well formed. Unfortunately, the results have been somewhat difficult to replicate by other surgeons and the need for multiple operations has tempered enthusiasm for this approach. The optimal treatment in cases of long gap esophageal atresia remains controversial.<ref name=\"Kunisaki2012\">{{Cite journal | last1 = Kunisaki | first1 = S. M. | last2 = Foker | first2 = J.

This method does not require replacing the missing section with grafts of the intestine or other body parts. Using electromagnetic force to attract the upper and lower ends of the esophagus together was first tried in the 1970s by using steel pellets attracted to each other by applying external electromagnets to the patient. In the 2000s a further refinement was developed by [[Mario Zaritzky]]'s group and others. The newer method uses permanent magnets and a balloon.\n# The magnets are inserted into the upper pouch via the baby's mouth or nose, and the lower via the gastrotomy feeding tube hole (which would have had to be made anyway to feed the baby, therefore not requiring any additional surgery).\n# The distance between the magnets is controlled by a balloon in the upper pouch, between the end of the pouch and the magnet. This also controls the force between the magnets so it is not strong enough to cause damage. \n# After the ends of the esophagus have stretched enough to touch, the upper magnet is replaced by one without a balloon and the stronger magnetic attraction causes the ends to fuse ([[anastomosis]]).<ref name=\"wral.com\"/><ref>http://radiology.uchicago.edu/news/dr-zaritzky-pioneers-non-surgical-option-babies-esophageal-atresia</ref><ref>http://web.mit.edu/2.75/projects/DMD2011-5231.pdf</ref><ref>{{cite journal | doi=10.1016/j.epsc.2014.03.004 | volume=2 | issue=4 | title=Staged repair of esophageal atresia: Pouch approximation and catheter-based magnetic anastomosis | journal=Journal of Pediatric Surgery Case Reports | pages=170\u2013175| year=2014 | last1=Lovvorn | first1=Harold N. | last2=Baron | first2=Christopher M. | last3=Danko | first3=Melissa E. | last4=Novotny | first4=Nathan M. | last5=Bucher | first5=Brian T. | last6=Johnston | first6=Krystal K. | last7=Zaritzky | first7=Mario F. }}</ref>\n\nIn April 2015 [[Annalise Dapo]] became the first patient in the United States to have their esophageal atresia corrected using magnets.<ref name=\"wral.com\">http://www.wral.com/pioneering-wakemed-procedure-corrects-infant-s-rare-disorder/14573393/#/vid14573546</ref><ref name=\"abc11.com\">http://abc11.com/health/new-non-invasive-procedure-for-infant-at-wakemed-is-first-of-its-kind-in-us/648350/</ref>\n\n==Complications==\n===Treatment complications===\nPost operative [[Complications (medical)|complications]] may include a leak at the site of closure of the esophagus. Sometimes a stricture, or tight spot, will develop in the esophagus, making it difficult to swallow. Esophageal stricture can usually be dilated using medical instruments. In later life, most children with this disorder will have some trouble with either swallowing or heartburn or both. Esophageal dismotility occurs in 75-100% of patients. After esophageal repair ([[anastomosis]]) the relative flaccidity of former proximal pouch (blind pouch, above) along with esophageal dysmotility can cause fluid buildup during feeding. Owing to proximity, pouch ballooning can cause tracheal occlusion. Severe hypoxia (\"dying spells\") follows and medical intervention can often be required.\n\n===Other related complications===\n[[Tracheomalacia]] a softening of the trachea, usually above the carina ([[carina of trachea]]), but sometimes extensive in the lower bronchial tree as well\u2014is another possible serious complication. A variety of treatments for tracheomalacia associated with esophageal atresia are available. If not severe, the condition can be managed expectantly since the trachea will usually stiffen as the infant matures into the first year of life.  When only the trachea above the carina is compromised, one of the \"simplest\" interventions is [[aortopexy]] wherein the aortic loop is attached to the rear of the sternum, thereby mechanically relieving pressure from the softened trachea.  An even simpler intervention is stenting.  However, epithelial cell proliferation and potential incorporation of the stent into the trachea can make subsequent removal dangerous.\n\nThe incidence of asthma, bronchitis, bronchial hyperresponsiveness, and recurrent infections in adolescent and adult esophageal atresia survivors far exceeds that of their healthy peers.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Sistonen S, Malmberg P, Malmstr\u00f6m K, et al.

Instead, it ends as a blind pouch. [[Tracheoesophageal fistula]] (TEF) represents an abnormal opening between the trachea and esophagus. EA and TEF can occur separately or together. EA and TEF are diagnosed in the [[Intensive care unit|ICU]] at birth and treated immediately.\n\nThe presence of EA is suspected in an infant with excessive salivation (drooling) and in a newborn with drooling that is frequently accompanied by choking, coughing and sneezing. When fed, these infants swallow normally but begin to cough and struggle as the fluid returns through the nose and mouth. The infant may become cyanotic (turn bluish due to lack of oxygen) and may stop breathing as the overflow of fluid from the blind pouch is aspirated (sucked into) the trachea. The cyanosis is a result of laryngospasm (a protective mechanism that the body has to prevent aspiration into the trachea). Over time respiratory distress will develop.\n\nIf any of the above signs/symptoms are noticed, a catheter is gently passed into the esophagus to check for resistance. If resistance is noted, other studies will be done to confirm the diagnosis. A catheter can be inserted and will show up as white on a regular x-ray film to demonstrate the blind pouch ending. Sometimes a small amount of [[barium sulfate|barium]] (chalk-like liquid) is placed through the mouth to diagnose the problems.\n\nTreatment of EA and TEF is surgery to repair the defect. If EA or TEF is suspected, all oral feedings are stopped and intravenous fluids are started. The infant will be positioned to help drain secretions and decrease the likelihood of aspiration. Babies with EA may sometimes have other problems. Studies will be done to look at the heart, spine and kidneys.\n\nSurgery to repair EA is essential as the baby will not be able to feed and is highly likely to develop pneumonia. Once the baby is in condition for surgery, an incision is made on the side of the chest. The esophagus can usually be sewn together. Following surgery, the baby may be hospitalized for a variable length of time. Care for each infant is individualized.\n\nIts very commonly seen in a newborn with [[imperforate anus]].\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n*{{cite book|author1=Harmon C.M. |author2=Coran A.G. | title=''Congenital anomalies of the esophagus''.

In his diaries, he compared Geonoa and Naples:\n\n\"It is already impossible for me to even enumerate what I have seen. Compared to Genoa, Naples is indolent, messy and sick. Compared to Naples, Genoa is one-sided. Naples has the greatest splendor alongside the greatest misery. Port life, carriage ride, high-level opera house, even a piece of Rome: the National Museum. Beside this the heavenly nature, unmatched. The sea of \u200b\u200bGenoa more imposing, but also more monotonous. Here a placid cove, framed by strange mountains and closed by characteristic islands. And all I can see from the balcony of my room. Like a giant amphitheater, the wonderful city with its intense buzz lies at my feet. On the left the old city with the docks of the port and the ancient Vesuvius, on the right the modern Villa Nazionale and Posillipo. All around the house there are gardens of fresh green, fantastic shapes and myriads of flowers. Salita del Petraio, Villa De Rosa 48, Pensione Haase, Naples, is called this fabulous panoramic lookout. The sea is wonderfully blue and calm. The city is a lively picture of clarity, facades of blocks of houses, in the light and darkness, white streets, sections of dark green parks. Faced with such a spectacle one thinks of the temptation of Christ. We are exalted by joy, we are hovering between shining spheres, which have become the center of a world.\"<ref name=\"pet3\">{{cite web\n |title        = Stairs that continue to reveal themselves: the church of the Petraio and the villa where Paul Klee lived\n |publisher    = Vomero Magazine\n |author       = Identitainsorgenti.com\n |date         = October 4, 2017\n |url          = https://translate.google.it/translate?hl=it&sl=it&tl=en&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.identitainsorgenti.com%2Fnapoli-a-piedi-scale-che-continuano-a-svelarsi-la-chiesa-del-petraio-e-la-villa-dove-dimoro-paul-klee%2F}}</ref>\n\n==In popular culture==\n*In the film [[The Four Days of Naples]], in the early stages of the Neapolitan uprising, a young man can be heard shouting: \"Pe 'e criatur' ro Petraio!\".\n*Popularly, the expression salir\u00e8 'ncoppo' is used in Santar\u00e8lla , which indicates the need to go from the Petraio to Villa La Santarella and Piazza Vanvitelli .\n*Author [[Nicola Pugliese]] in his book ''Malacqua'', cites Petraio, describing the origin of his name.\n\n==See Also==\n[[Stairways in Naples]]<br>\n[[Matera]]\n\n{{coord|40|50|35.87|N|14|14|10.70|E|display=title|region:IT_type:city_source:GNS-enwiki}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Petraio}}\n[[Category:Tourist attractions in Naples]]\n[[Category:Zones of Naples]]\n\n==External References==\n* [https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&hl=it&rurl=translate.google.it&sl=it&sp=nmt4&tl=en&u=http://www.scaledinapoli.com/&usg=ALkJrhjlxbq3eRVLr6oflxJlrzYoms77hA Stairways of Naples]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n", "name_user": "842U", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200ePaul Klee", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petraio"}

Its themes include Lawrence's emotional struggles with the personal violence inherent in war, his own identity, and his divided allegiance between his native Britain and its army, and his new-found comrades within the Arabian desert tribes. The film also stars [[Jack Hawkins]], [[Anthony Quinn]], [[Omar Sharif]], [[Anthony Quayle]], [[Claude Rains]] and [[Arthur Kennedy]].\n\n''Lawrence of Arabia'' was nominated for ten [[Academy Awards|Oscars]] at the [[35th Academy Awards]] in 1963; it won seven, including Best Picture and Best Director. It also won the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture \u2013 Drama]] and the [[British Academy Film Awards|BAFTA Awards]] for Best Film and Outstanding British Film. In the years since, it has been recognised as one of the greatest and most influential films in the history of cinema.

In 1999, the [[British Film Institute]] named the film the [[BFI Top 100 British films|third-greatest British film of all time]]. In 2004, it was voted the [[List of films considered the best|best British film of all time]] in a ''[[Sunday Telegraph]]'' poll of Britain's leading filmmakers.\n\n== Plot ==\nThe film is presented in two parts, divided by an [[Intermission#Films|intermission]].\n\n=== Part I ===\nThe film opens in 1935 when Lawrence is killed in a [[motorcycle accident]]. At his memorial service at [[St Paul's Cathedral]], a reporter tries (with little success) to gain insights into this remarkable, enigmatic man from those who knew him.\n\nThe story then moves back to the [[World War I|First World War]], where Lawrence is a misfit [[British Army]] [[Lieutenant (British Army and Royal Marines)|lieutenant]], notable for his insolence and education. Over the objections of [[Archibald Murray|General Murray]], [[Mr. Dryden]] of the [[Arab Bureau]] sends him to assess the prospects of [[Faisal I of Iraq|Prince Faisal]] in [[Arab Revolt|his revolt]] against the [[Ottoman Empire|Turks]]. On the journey, his [[Bedouin people|Bedouin]] guide, Tafas, is killed by Sherif Ali for drinking from his well without permission. Lawrence later meets Colonel Brighton, who orders him to keep quiet, make his assessment, and leave. Lawrence ignores Brighton's orders when he meets Faisal. His outspokenness piques the prince's interest.\n\nBrighton advises Faisal to retreat after a major defeat, but Lawrence proposes a daring [[Battle of Aqaba|surprise attack on Aqaba]]; its capture would provide a port from which the British could offload much-needed supplies. The town is strongly fortified against a naval assault but only lightly defended on the landward side. He convinces Faisal to provide fifty men, led by a sceptical<!-- This is not an error; sceptical is the correct British spelling --> Sherif Ali. Teenage orphans Daud and Farraj attach themselves to Lawrence as servants. They cross the [[Nefud Desert]], considered impassable even by the Bedouins, travelling day and night on the last stage to reach water. One of Ali's men, Gasim, succumbs to fatigue and falls off his camel unnoticed during the night. When Lawrence discovers him missing, he turns back and rescues Gasim\u2014and Sherif Ali is won over. He gives Lawrence Arab robes to wear.\n\nLawrence persuades [[Auda abu Tayi]], the leader of the powerful local [[Howeitat]] tribe, to turn against the Turks. Lawrence's scheme is almost derailed when one of Ali's men kills one of Auda's because of a [[blood feud]]. Howeitat retaliation would shatter the fragile alliance, so Lawrence declares that he will execute the murderer himself. He is then stunned to discover that the culprit is Gasim, the very man he risked his own life to save in the desert, but he shoots him anyway.\n\nThe next morning, the Arabs overrun the Turkish [[garrison]]. Lawrence heads to [[Cairo]] to inform Dryden and the new commander, [[Edmund Allenby, 1st Viscount Allenby|General Allenby]], of his victory. While crossing the [[Sinai Desert]], Daud dies when he stumbles into [[Dry quicksand|quicksand]]. Lawrence is promoted to [[Major (United Kingdom)|major]] and given arms and money for the Arabs. He is deeply disturbed, confessing that he enjoyed executing Gasim, but Allenby brushes aside his qualms. He asks Allenby whether there is any basis for the Arabs' suspicions that the [[Sykes\u2013Picot Agreement|British have designs on Arabia]]. When pressed, the general states that they do not.\n\n=== Part II ===\nLawrence launches a [[guerrilla war]], blowing up trains and harassing the Turks at every turn. [[United States|American]] [[war correspondent]] Jackson Bentley publicises Lawrence's exploits, making him famous. On one raid, Farraj is badly injured. Unwilling to leave him to be tortured by the enemy, Lawrence shoots him dead before fleeing.\n\nWhen Lawrence scouts the enemy-held city of [[Daraa|Deraa]] with Ali, he is taken, along with several Arab residents, to the Turkish [[Bey]]. Lawrence is stripped, ogled, and prodded. Then, for striking out at the Bey, he is severely [[Flogging|flogged]] before being thrown into the street. The experience leaves Lawrence shaken. He returns to British headquarters in Cairo but does not fit in.\n\nA short time later in [[Jerusalem]], General Allenby urges him to support the \"big push\" on [[Damascus]]. Lawrence hesitates to return but finally relents.\n\nLawrence recruits an army that is motivated more by money than by the Arab cause. They sight a column of retreating Turkish soldiers who have just [[Tafas massacre|massacred the residents of Tafas]]. One of Lawrence's men is from [[Tafas]]; he demands, \"No prisoners!\" When Lawrence hesitates, the man charges the Turks alone and is killed. Lawrence takes up the dead man's battle cry; the result is a slaughter in which Lawrence himself participates. Afterwards, he regrets his actions.\n\nLawrence's men take Damascus ahead of Allenby's forces. The Arabs set up a council to administer the city, but the desert tribesmen prove ill-suited for such a task. Despite Lawrence's efforts, they bicker constantly. Unable to maintain the [[Public utility|public utilities]], the Arabs soon abandon most of the city to the British.\n\nLawrence is promoted to [[Colonel (United Kingdom)|colonel]] and immediately ordered back to Britain, as his usefulness to both Faisal and the British is at an end. As he leaves the city, his automobile is passed by a motorcyclist who leaves a trail of dust in his wake.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Peter O'Toole]] as [[T. E. Lawrence]]. [[Albert Finney]] was a virtual unknown at the time, but he was Lean's first choice to play Lawrence. Finney was cast and began principal photography but was fired after two days for reasons that are still unclear.  [[Marlon Brando]] was also offered the part, and [[Anthony Perkins]] and [[Montgomery Clift]] were briefly considered before O'Toole was cast.<ref>{{Harvnb|Turner|1994|pages=41\u201345}}</ref> [[Alec Guinness]] had previously played Lawrence in the play ''[[Ross (play)|Ross]]'' and was briefly considered for the part, but David Lean and Sam Spiegel thought him too old.

Faisal was originally to be portrayed by [[Laurence Olivier]]. Guinness performed in other David Lean films, and he got the part when Olivier dropped out. Guinness was made up to look as much like the real Faisal as possible; he recorded in his diaries that, while shooting in Jordan, he met several people who had known Faisal who actually mistook him for the late prince. Guinness said in interviews that he developed his Arab accent from a conversation that he had with Omar Sharif.\n* [[Anthony Quinn]] as [[Auda ibu Tayi|Auda abu Tayi]]. Quinn got very much into his role; he spent hours applying his own makeup, using a photograph of the real Auda to make himself look as much like him as he could. One anecdote has Quinn arriving on-set for the first time in full costume, whereupon Lean mistook him for a native and asked his assistant to ring Quinn and notify him that they were replacing him with the new arrival.\n* [[Jack Hawkins]] as [[Edmund Allenby, 1st Viscount Allenby|General Allenby]]. Sam Spiegel pushed Lean to cast [[Cary Grant]] or [[Laurence Olivier]] (who was engaged at the [[Chichester Festival Theatre]] and declined). Lean convinced him to choose Hawkins because of his work for them on ''[[The Bridge on the River Kwai]]''. Hawkins shaved his head for the role and reportedly clashed with Lean several times during filming.  Guinness recounted that Hawkins was reprimanded by Lean for celebrating the end of a day's filming with an impromptu dance. Hawkins became close friends with O'Toole during filming, and the two often improvised dialogue during takes to Lean's dismay.\n* [[Omar Sharif]] as Sherif Ali. The role was offered to many actors before Sharif was cast. [[Horst Buchholz]] was the first choice, but had already signed on for the film ''[[One, Two, Three]]''. [[Alain Delon]] had a successful screen test but ultimately declined because of the brown contact lenses he would have had to wear. [[Maurice Ronet]] and [[Dilip Kumar]] were also considered.<ref>{{Harvnb|Turner|1994|pages=45\u201349}}</ref> Sharif, who was already a major star in the Middle East, was originally cast as Lawrence's guide Tafas, but when the aforementioned actors proved unsuitable, Sharif was shifted to the part of Ali.\n* [[Jos\u00e9 Ferrer]] as the Turkish Bey. Ferrer was initially unsatisfied with the small size of his part and accepted the role only on the condition of being paid $25,000 (more than O'Toole and Sharif combined) plus a [[Porsche]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Turner|1994|p=49}}</ref> However, he afterwards considered this his best film performance, saying in an interview: \"If I was to be judged by any one film performance, it would be my five minutes in ''Lawrence''.\" Peter O'Toole once said that he learned more about screen acting from Ferrer than he could in any acting class.\n* [[Anthony Quayle]] as Colonel [[Harry Brighton]]. Quayle, a veteran of military roles, was cast after Jack Hawkins, the original choice, was shifted to the part of Allenby. Quayle and Lean argued over how to portray the character, with Lean feeling Brighton to be an honourable character, while Quayle thought him an idiot.\n* [[Claude Rains]] as [[Mr. Dryden]]\n* [[Arthur Kennedy]] as [[Jackson Bentley]]. In the early days of the production, when the Bentley character had a more prominent role in the film, [[Kirk Douglas]] was considered for the part; Douglas expressed interest but demanded a star salary and the highest billing after O'Toole and thus was turned down by Spiegel. Later, [[Edmond O'Brien]] was cast in the part.<ref>{{Harvnb|Turner|1994|p=51}}</ref> O'Brien filmed the Jerusalem scene, and (according to Omar Sharif) Bentley's political discussion with Ali, but he suffered a heart attack on location and had to be replaced at the last moment by Kennedy, who was recommended to Lean by Anthony Quinn.<ref>{{Harvnb|Turner|1994|pages=137\u201338}}</ref>\n* [[Donald Wolfit]] as [[Archibald Murray|General Murray]]\n* [[I.

His English was not considered good enough, so he was dubbed by [[Robert Rietti]] (uncredited){{citation needed|date=November 2018}} in the final film.\n* [[Michel de Carvalho|Michel Ray]] as Farraj. At the time, Ray was an up-and-coming Anglo-Brazilian actor who had previously appeared in several films, including [[Irving Rapper]]'s ''[[The Brave One (1956 film)|The Brave One]]'' and [[Anthony Mann]]'s ''[[The Tin Star]]''.\n* John Dimech as Daud\n* [[Zia Mohyeddin]] as Tafas.

E. Lawrence]]\n* [[Faisal I of Iraq|Prince Faisal]]\n* [[Auda Abu Tayi]]\n* [[Edmund Allenby, 1st Viscount Allenby|General Allenby]]\n* [[Archibald Murray|General Murray]]\n* Farraj and Daud, Lawrence's servants\n* Gasim, the man whom Lawrence rescues from the desert\n* Talal, who charges the Turkish column at Tafas\n\n; Fictional characters\n* Sherif Ali: A combination of numerous Arab leaders, particularly Sharif Nassir\u2014Faisal's cousin\u2014who led the Harith forces involved in the attack on [[Aqaba]]. The character was created largely because Lawrence did not serve with any one Arab leader (aside from Auda) throughout the majority of the war; most such leaders were amalgamated in Ali's character.\n* Mr Dryden: The cynical [[Arab Bureau]] official was based loosely on numerous figures, including [[Ronald Storrs|Sir Ronald Storrs]], who was head of the Arab Bureau and later the governor of [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine]]. It was largely Storrs' doing that Lawrence first met Faisal and became involved with the Revolt. This character is also partially based upon Lawrence's archaeologist friend [[D. G. Hogarth]], as well as [[Henry McMahon (diplomat)|Henry McMahon]], who historically fulfilled Dryden's role as a political liaison. He was created by the screenwriters to \"represent the civilian and political wing of British interests, to balance Allenby's military objectives.\"\n* Colonel Brighton: In essence a composite of all of the British officers who served in the Middle East with Lawrence, most notably Lt. Col. [[S.F. Newcombe]]. Newcombe played much the same role as Brighton does in the film, being Lawrence's predecessor as liaison to the Arab Revolt; he and many of his men were captured by the Turks in 1916, but he later escaped. Also, like Brighton, Newcombe was not well liked by the Arabs, though he remained friends with Lawrence. (In Michael Wilson's original script, he ''was'' Colonel Newcombe; the character's name was changed by Robert Bolt.) Brighton was apparently created to represent how ordinary British soldiers would feel about a man like Lawrence: impressed by his accomplishments but repulsed by his affected manner. (Lean argued that Brighton was \"the only honourable character\" in the film, whereas [[Anthony Quayle]] referred to his character as an \"idiot\".)\n* Turkish Bey: The Turkish Bey who captures Lawrence in [[Deraa]] was\u2014according to Lawrence himself\u2014General Hajim Bey (in Turkish, ''Hacim Muhiddin Bey''), though he is not named in the film. The incident was mentioned in ''Seven Pillars of Wisdom''. Some biographers ([[Jeremy Wilson]], [[John E. Mack|John Mack]]) argue that Lawrence's account is to be believed; others ([[Michael Asher (explorer)|Michael Asher]], [[Lawrence James]]) argue that contemporary evidence suggests that Lawrence never went to Deraa at this time and that the story is invented.\n* Jackson Bentley: Based on famed American journalist [[Lowell Thomas]], who helped make Lawrence famous with accounts of his bravery. However, Thomas was a young man at the time who spent only a few days (or weeks at most) with Lawrence in the field\u2014unlike Bentley, who is depicted as a cynical middle-aged Chicago newspaperman who is present during the whole of Lawrence's later campaigns. Bentley was the narrator in Wilson's original script, but Bolt reduced his role significantly for the final script. Thomas did not start reporting on Lawrence until after the end of World War I, and held Lawrence in high regard, unlike Bentley, who seems to view Lawrence in terms of a story that he can write about.\n* Tafas: Lawrence's guide to Faisal is based on his actual guide Sheikh Obeid el-Rashid of the Hazimi branch of the Beni Salem, whom Lawrence referred to as Tafas several times in ''Seven Pillars''.\n* Medical officer: This unnamed officer who confronts Lawrence in Damascus is based on an officer mentioned in an incident in ''Seven Pillars of Wisdom''. Lawrence's meeting the officer again while in British uniform was an invention of Wilson or Bolt.\n\n== Historical accuracy ==\nMost of the film's characters are based on actual people to varying degrees. Some scenes were heavily fictionalised, such as the [[Battle of Aqaba|attack on Aqaba]], while those dealing with the Arab Council were inaccurate, inasmuch as the council remained more or less in power in [[Syria]] until France deposed Faisal in 1920. Little background is provided on the history of the region, the First World War, and the Arab Revolt, probably because of Bolt's increased focus on Lawrence (while Wilson's draft script had a broader, more politicised version of events). The second half of the film portrayed a completely fictional depiction of Lawrence's Arab army deserting almost to a man as he moved farther north. The film's timeline is frequently questionable on the [[Arab Revolt]] and [[World War I]], as well as the geography of the [[Hejaz]] region. For instance, Bentley interviews Faisal in late 1917, after the fall of Aqaba, saying that the United States has not yet entered the war, yet the US had been in the war for several months by that time. Further, Lawrence's involvement in the Arab Revolt prior to the attack on Aqaba is completely excised, such as his involvement in the seizures of [[Yenbo]] and [[Wejh]]. The rescue and execution of Gasim are based on two separate incidents, which were conflated for dramatic reasons.\n\nThe film shows Lawrence representing the Allied cause in the Hejaz almost alone, with Colonel Brighton ([[Anthony Quayle]]) the only British officer there to assist him. In fact, there were numerous British officers such as colonels Cyril Wilson, Stewart Francis Newcombe, and Pierce C. Joyce, all of whom arrived before Lawrence began serving in Arabia.<ref>Murphy, David ''The Arab Revolt 1916\u20131918'', London: Osprey, 2008. p. 17</ref> In addition, there was a French military mission led by Colonel Edouard Br\u00e9mond serving in the Hejaz, of which no mention is made in the film.<ref>Murphy, David ''The Arab Revolt 1916\u20131918'', London: Osprey, 2008. p. 18</ref> The film shows Lawrence as the sole originator of the attacks on the Hejaz railroad. The first attacks on this began in early January 1917 led by officers such as Newcombe.<ref>Murphy, David ''The Arab Revolt 1916\u20131918'', London: Osprey, 2008. p. 39</ref> The first successful attack on the Hejaz railroad with a locomotive-destroying \"Garland mine\" was led by Major [[Herbert Garland]] in February 1917, a month before Lawrence's first attack.<ref>Murphy, David ''The Arab Revolt 1916\u20131918'', London: Osprey, 2008. pp. 43\u201344</ref>\n\nThe film shows the [[Hashemite]] forces as consisting of Bedouin guerrillas, whereas the core of the Hashemite forces was the regular Arab Army recruited from Ottoman Arab prisoners of war, who wore British-style uniforms with [[keffiyeh]]s and fought in conventional battles.<ref>Murphy, David ''The Arab Revolt 1916\u20131918'', London: Osprey, 2008 p. 24</ref> The film makes no mention of the [[Sharifian Army]], and leaves the viewer with the impression that the Hashemite forces were composed exclusively of Bedouin irregulars.\n\n=== Representation of Lawrence ===\n[[File:Peter O'Toole in Lawrence of Arabia.png|thumb|upright=1.15|left|[[Peter O'Toole]] as T. E. Lawrence]]\nMany complaints about the film's accuracy concern the characterisation of Lawrence. The perceived problems with the portrayal begin with the differences in his physical appearance; the {{convert|6|ft|2|in|m|adj=on}} [[Peter O'Toole]] was almost {{convert|9|in|cm}} taller than the {{convert|5|ft|5|in|m|adj=on}} Lawrence.<ref>{{cite book | last = Orlans | first = Harold | title = T. E. Lawrence: Biography of a Broken Hero | publisher = McFarland | page = 111 | date = 2002 | isbn = 0-7864-1307-7 }}</ref> His behaviour, however, has caused much more debate.\n\nThe screenwriters depict Lawrence as an egotist. It is not clear to what degree Lawrence sought or shunned attention, as evident in his use of various assumed names after the war. Even during the war, [[Lowell Thomas]] wrote in ''With Lawrence in Arabia'' that he could take pictures of him only by tricking him, although Lawrence did later agree to pose for several photos for Thomas's stage show. Thomas's famous comment that Lawrence \"had a genius for backing into the limelight\" can be taken to suggest that his extraordinary actions prevented him from being as private as he would have liked, or it can be taken to suggest that Lawrence made a pretence of avoiding the limelight while subtly placing himself at centre stage. Others point to Lawrence's own writings to support the argument that he was egotistical.\n\nLawrence's sexual orientation remains a controversial topic among historians. Bolt's primary source was ostensibly ''Seven Pillars'', but the film's portrayal seems informed by [[Richard Aldington]]'s ''Biographical Inquiry'' (1955) which posited Lawrence as a \"pathological liar and exhibitionist\", as well as a homosexual. This is opposed to his portrayal in ''Ross'' as \"physically and spiritually recluse\".<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Weintraub|first=Stanley|year=1964|title=Lawrence of Arabia|jstor=1210914|journal=Film Quarterly|volume=17|issue=3|pages=51\u201354|doi=10.2307/1210914}}</ref> Historians such as [[Basil Liddell Hart]] disputed the film's depiction of Lawrence as an active participant in the attack and slaughter of the retreating Turkish columns who had committed the [[Tafas massacre]], but most current biographers accept the film's portrayal as reasonably accurate.\n\nThe film does show that Lawrence could speak and read Arabic, could quote the [[Quran]], and was reasonably knowledgeable about the region. It barely mentions his archaeological travels from 1911 to 1914 in Syria and Arabia and ignores his espionage work, including a pre-war topographical survey of the Sinai Peninsula and his attempts to negotiate the release of British prisoners at [[Siege of Kut|Kut]] in [[Mesopotamia]] in 1916. Furthermore, Lawrence is made aware of the [[Sykes\u2013Picot Agreement]] very late in the story and is shown to be appalled by it, whereas he actually knew about it much earlier while fighting alongside the Arabs.<ref>cf. Jeremy Wilson, ''Lawrence of Arabia: The Authorised Biography of T. E. Lawrence'' (1990), pp. 409\u201310</ref>\n\nLawrence's biographers have a mixed reaction towards the film. Authorised biographer Jeremy Wilson noted that the film has \"undoubtedly influenced the perceptions of some subsequent biographers\", such as the depiction of the film's Ali being real rather than a composite character, and also highlighting the Deraa incident.<ref>{{cite web | last=Wilson | first=Jeremy | url=http://www.telstudies.org/discussion/film_tv_radio/lofa_or_sid_1.shtml | title=Lawrence of Arabia or Smith in the Desert? | publisher=T. E. Lawrence Studies | accessdate=9 July 2015 }}</ref> The film's historical inaccuracies, in Wilson's view, are more troublesome than should be allowed under normal dramatic licence. At the time, Liddell Hart publicly criticised the film, engaging Bolt in a lengthy correspondence over its portrayal of Lawrence.<ref>L. Robert Morris and Lawrence Raskin. ''Lawrence of Arabia: The 30th Anniversary Pictorial History.'' pp. 149\u201356</ref>\n\n=== Representation of other characters ===\n{{more citations needed|section|date=March 2019}}\nThe film portrays General Allenby as cynical and manipulative, with a superior attitude to Lawrence, but there is much evidence that Allenby and Lawrence liked and respected one another. Lawrence once said that Allenby was \"an admiration of mine\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.castlehillpress.com/plates/pl01.htm |title=''The Seven Pillars'' Portraits |publisher=castlehillpress.com}}</ref> and later that he was \"physically large and confident and morally so great that the comprehension of our littleness came slow to him\".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/lawrenceofarabia/players/allenby.html |title=General Allenby (biography) |publisher=pbs.org}}</ref> The fictional Allenby's words at Lawrence's funeral in the film stand in contrast to the real Allenby's remarks upon Lawrence's death: \"I have lost a good friend and a valued comrade. Lawrence was under my command, but, after acquainting him with my strategical plan, I gave him a free hand. His co-operation was marked by the utmost loyalty, and I never had anything but praise for his work, which, indeed, was invaluable throughout the campaign.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/lawrenceofarabia/players/allenby2.html |title=General Allenby (radio interview) |publisher=pbs.org}}</ref> Allenby also spoke highly of him numerous times and, much to Lawrence's delight, publicly endorsed the accuracy of ''Seven Pillars of Wisdom''. Allenby did manipulate Lawrence during the war, but their relationship lasted for years after its end, indicating that in real life they were friendly, if not close. The Allenby family was particularly upset by the Damascus scenes, where Allenby coldly allows the town to fall into chaos as the Arab Council collapses.<ref>Steven C. Caton, ''Lawrence of Arabia: A Film's Anthropology'', p. 59</ref>\n\nSimilarly, General Murray was initially sceptical of the Arab Revolt's potential, but he thought highly of Lawrence's abilities as an intelligence officer; indeed, it was largely through Lawrence's persuasion that Murray came to support the revolt. The intense dislike shown toward Lawrence in the film is in fact the opposite of Murray's real feelings, although for his part Lawrence seemed not to hold Murray in any high regard.\n\nThe depiction of Auda abu Tayi as a man interested only in loot and money is also at odds with the historical record. Auda did at first join the revolt for monetary reasons, but he quickly became a steadfast supporter of Arab independence, notably after Aqaba's capture. He refused repeated bribery attempts by the Turks (though he happily pocketed their money) and remained loyal to the revolt, going so far as to knock out his false teeth, which were Turkish made. He was present with Lawrence from the beginning of the Aqaba expedition and in fact helped plan it along with Lawrence and Prince Faisal.\n\nFaisal was far from being the middle-aged man depicted and was in his early 30s at the time of the revolt. Faisal and Lawrence respected each other's capabilities and intelligence. They worked well together.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/lawrenceofarabia/players/feisal.html |title=Prince Feisal |publisher=pbs.org}}</ref>\n\nThe reactions of those who knew Lawrence and the other characters say much about the film's veracity.  The most vehement critic of its accuracy was Professor [[A. W. Lawrence|A. W. (Arnold) Lawrence]], the protagonist's younger brother and literary executor, who had sold the rights to ''Seven Pillars of Wisdom'' to Spiegel for \u00a325,000. Arnold Lawrence went on a campaign in the United States and Britain denouncing the film, famously saying, \"I should not have recognised my own brother\". In one pointed talk show appearance, he remarked that he had found the film \"pretentious and false\". He went on to say that his brother was \"one of the nicest, kindest and most exhilarating people I've known. He often appeared cheerful when he was unhappy.\" Later, Arnold said to the ''[[New York Times]]'', \"[The film is] a psychological recipe. Take an ounce of narcissism, a pound of exhibitionism, a pint of sadism, a gallon of blood-lust and a sprinkle of other aberrations and stir well.\" Lowell Thomas was also critical of the portrayal of Lawrence and most of the film's characters, believing that the train attack scenes were the only reasonably accurate aspect of the film.\n\nThe criticisms were not restricted to Lawrence. The Allenby family lodged a formal complaint against Columbia about the portrayal of him. Descendants of Auda abu Tayi and the real Sherif Ali, Sharif Nassir, went further, suing Columbia despite the fact that the film's Ali was a fictional composite character. The Auda case went on for almost 10 years before it was dropped.<ref>Adrian Turner, ''Robert Bolt: Scenes From Two Lives'', 201\u201306</ref>\n\nThe film has its defenders. Biographer [[Michael Korda]], author of ''Hero: The Life and Legend of Lawrence of Arabia'', offers a different opinion. The film is neither \"the full story of Lawrence's life or a completely accurate account of the two years he spent fighting with the Arabs,\" yet Korda argues that criticising its inaccuracy \"misses the point\": \"The object was to produce, not a faithful docudrama that would educate the audience, but a hit picture.\"<ref>Korda, pp. 693\u201394</ref> Stephen E. Tabachnick goes further than Korda, arguing that the film's portrayal of Lawrence is \"appropriate and true to the text of ''Seven Pillars of Wisdom''\".<ref>''Lawrence of Arabia: An Encyclopedia.'' Westport, CT: Greenwood, Press, 2004. p. 24</ref> British historian of the Arab Revolt David Murphy wrote that although the film was flawed due to various inaccuracies and omissions, \"it was a truly epic movie and is rightly seen as a classic\".<ref>Murphy, David ''The Arab Revolt'', Osprey: London, 2008 pp. 88\u201389</ref>\n\n== Production ==\n=== Pre-production ===\nPrevious films about T. E. Lawrence had been planned but had not been made. In the 1940s, [[Alexander Korda]] was interested in filming ''The Seven Pillars of Wisdom'' with [[Laurence Olivier]], [[Leslie Howard (actor)|Leslie Howard]], or [[Robert Donat]] as Lawrence, but had to pull out owing to financial difficulties. David Lean had been approached to direct a 1952 version for the [[Rank Organisation]], but the project fell through.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Beyond the Epic: The Life & Films of David Lean|last=Phillips|first=Gene D.|publisher=The University Press of Kentucky|year=2006|isbn=978-0-8131-2415-5|location=Lexington|page=258|quote=|via=}}</ref> At the same time as pre-production of the film, [[Terence Rattigan]] was developing his play ''[[Ross (play)|Ross]]'' which centred primarily on Lawrence's alleged [[homosexuality]]. ''Ross'' had begun as a screenplay, but was re-written for the stage when the film project fell through. Sam Spiegel grew furious and attempted to have the play suppressed, which helped to gain publicity for the film.<ref>{{Harvnb|Brownlow|1996|pages=410\u201311}}</ref> [[Dirk Bogarde]] had accepted the role in ''Ross''; he described the cancellation of the project as \"my bitterest disappointment\". Alec Guinness played the role on stage.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Peter O'Toole: The Definitive Biography|last=Sellers|first=Robert|publisher=Pan Macmillan|year=2015|isbn=978-0-283-07216-1|location=London|pages=|quote=my bitterest disappointment}}</ref>\n\nLean and Sam Spiegel had worked together on ''[[The Bridge on the River Kwai]]'' and decided to collaborate again. For a time, Lean was interested in a biopic of [[Gandhi]], with Alec Guinness to play the title role and [[Emeric Pressburger]] writing the screenplay. He eventually lost interest in the project, despite extensive pre-production work, including location scouting in India and a meeting with [[Jawaharlal Nehru]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Brownlow|1996|pages=393\u2013401}}</ref> Lean then returned his attention to T. E. Lawrence. [[Columbia Pictures]] had an interest in a Lawrence project dating back to the early '50s, and the project got underway when Spiegel convinced a reluctant [[A. W. Lawrence]] to sell the rights to ''[[The Seven Pillars of Wisdom]]'' for \u00a322,500.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Beyond the Epic: The Life and Films of David Lean|last=Phillips|first=Gene D.|publisher=The University Press of Kentucky|year=2006|isbn=978-0-8131-2415-5|location=Lexington|page=271|quote=|via=}}</ref>\n\n[[Michael Wilson (writer)|Michael Wilson]] wrote the original draft of the screenplay. Lean was dissatisfied with Wilson's work, primarily because his treatment focused on the historical and political aspects of the Arab Revolt. Lean hired [[Robert Bolt]] to re-write the script to make it a character study of Lawrence. Many of the characters and scenes are Wilson's invention, but virtually all of the dialogue in the finished film was written by Bolt.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Beyond the Epic: The Life and Films of David Lean|last=Phillips|first=Gene D.|publisher=The University Press of Kentucky|year=2006|isbn=978-0-8131-2415-5|location=Lexington|pages=270\u201382|quote=|via=}}</ref>\n\nLean reportedly watched [[John Ford]]'s film ''[[The Searchers]]'' (1956) to help him develop ideas as to how to shoot the film. Several scenes directly recall Ford's film, most notably Ali's entrance at the well and the composition of many of the desert scenes and the dramatic exit from [[Wadi Rum]]. Lean biographer [[Kevin Brownlow]] notes a physical similarity between Wadi Rum and Ford's [[Monument Valley]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Brownlow|1996|page=443}}</ref>\n\n=== Filming ===\n{{More citations needed section|date=August 2014}}\n\nThe film was made by [[Horizon Pictures]] and [[Columbia Pictures]]. Principal photography began on 15 May 1961 and ended on 21 September 1962.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Beyond the Epic: The Life and Films of David Lean|last=Phillips|first=Gene D.|publisher=The University Press of Kentucky|year=2006|isbn=978-0-8131-2415-5|location=Lexington|pages=291, 303|quote=|via=}}</ref>\n\nThe desert scenes were shot in [[Jordan]] and [[Morocco]], as well as [[Almer\u00eda (province)|Almer\u00eda]] and [[Do\u00f1ana National Park|Do\u00f1ana]] in Spain. It was originally to be filmed entirely in Jordan; the government of [[Hussein of Jordan|King Hussein]] was extremely helpful in providing logistical assistance, location scouting, transportation, and extras. Hussein himself visited the set several times during production and maintained cordial relationships with cast and crew. The only tension occurred when Jordanian officials learned that English actor [[Henry Oscar]] did not speak Arabic but would be filmed reciting the [[Qur'an]]. Permission was granted only on condition that an imam be present to ensure that there were no misquotations.\n\n[[File:Pabellon Mudejar.JPG|thumb|The [[Mud\u00e9jar]] pavilion of the [[Parque de Mar\u00eda Luisa]] in Seville appeared as Damascus.]]\n[[File:Spain Andalusia Seville BW 2015-10-23 15-35-15.jpg|thumb|The [[Plaza de Espa\u00f1a, Seville]] appeared as Britain's Egyptian Expeditionary Force Headquarters in Cairo, which included the officers' club.]]\nLean planned to film in Aqaba and the archaeological site at [[Petra]], which Lawrence had been fond of as a place of study. However, the production had to be moved to Spain due to cost and outbreaks of illness among the cast and crew before these scenes could be shot. The attack on Aqaba was reconstructed in a dried river bed in Playa del Algarrobico, southern Spain (at {{nowrap|{{coord|37|1|25|N|1|52|53|W|region:ES_type:landmark|display=inline}}}}); it consisted of more than 300 buildings and was meticulously based on the town's appearance in 1917. The execution of Gasim, the train attacks, and Deraa exteriors were filmed in the [[Almer\u00eda]] region, with some of the filming being delayed because of a flash flood. The [[Sierra Nevada (Spain)|Sierra Nevada]] mountains filled in for Azrak, Lawrence's winter quarters. The city of [[Seville]] was used to represent [[Cairo]], [[Jerusalem]], and [[Damascus]], with the appearance of [[Casa de Pilatos]], the [[Alc\u00e1zar of Seville]], and the [[Plaza de Espa\u00f1a (Seville)|Plaza de Espa\u00f1a]]. All of the interiors were shot in Spain, including Lawrence's first meeting with Faisal and the scene in Auda's tent. The Tafas massacre was filmed in [[Ouarzazate]], Morocco, with Moroccan army troops substituting for the Turkish army; however, Lean could not film as much as he wanted because the soldiers were uncooperative and impatient.<ref>{{Harvnb|Brownlow|1996|pages=466\u201367}}</ref>\n\nThe film's production was frequently delayed because shooting commenced without a finished script. Wilson quit early in the production, and playwright [[Beverley Cross]] worked on the script in the interim before Bolt took over, although none of Cross's material made it to the final film. A further mishap occurred when Bolt was arrested for taking part in an anti-nuclear weapons demonstration, and Spiegel had to persuade him to sign a recognizance of good behaviour to be released from jail and continue working on the script.\n\nO'Toole was not used to riding camels and found the saddle to be uncomfortable. During a break in filming, he bought a piece of foam rubber at a market and added it to his saddle. Many of the extras copied the idea and sheets of the foam can be seen on many of the horse and camel saddles. The Bedouin nicknamed O'Toole {{\"'}}Ab al-'Isfanjah\" ({{lang|ar|\u0623\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u0625\u0633\u0641\u0646\u062c\u0629}}), meaning \"Father of the Sponge\".<ref>[[Peter O'Toole]], interview on the ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]'', 11 May 1995.</ref> During the filming of the Aqaba scene, O'Toole was nearly killed when he fell from his camel, but it fortunately stood over him, preventing the horses of the extras from trampling him. Coincidentally, a very similar mishap befell the real Lawrence at the [[Battle of Aqaba|Battle of Abu El Lissal]] in 1917.\n\nJordan banned the film for what was felt to be a disrespectful portrayal of Arab culture.<ref name=\"Woolf\" /> Egypt, Omar Sharif's home country, was the only Arab nation to give the film a wide release, where it became a success through the endorsement of President [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]], who appreciated the film's depiction of [[Pan-Arabism|Arab nationalism]].\n\n[[Super Panavision 70|Super Panavision]] technology was used to shoot the film, meaning that spherical lenses were used instead of anamorphic ones, and the image was exposed on a 65&nbsp;mm negative, then printed onto a 70&nbsp;mm positive to leave room for the soundtracks. Rapid cutting was more disturbing on the wide screen, so filmmakers had to apply longer and more fluid takes. Shooting such a wide ratio produced some unwanted effects during projection, such as a peculiar \"flutter\" effect, a blurring of certain parts of the image. To avoid the problem, the director often had to modify blocking, giving the actor a more diagonal movement, where the flutter was less likely to occur.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Lawrence of Arabia: A Film's Anthropology|last=Caton|first=Steven Charles|publisher=University of California Press|year=1950|isbn=0-520-21082-4|location=Los Angeles|pages=70, 71|quote=|via=}}</ref> David Lean was asked whether he could handle [[CinemaScope]]: \"If one had an eye for composition, there would be no problem.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Epic Films of David Lean|last=Santas|first=Constantine|publisher=The Scarecrow Press, Inc.|year=2012|isbn=|location=Plymouth UK|page=xxvi|quote=|via=}}</ref>\n\nO'Toole did not share Lawrence's love of the desert and stated in an interview: \"I loathe it.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUyixfiE_oM|title=Peter O'Toole talks about 'Lawrence of Arabia' in rare 1963 interview|publisher=YouTube|date= |accessdate=2014-11-04}}</ref>\n\n=== Music ===\nThe [[film score]] was composed by [[Maurice Jarre]], little known at the time and selected only after both [[William Walton]] and [[Malcolm Arnold]] had proved unavailable.

[[Adrian Boult|Sir Adrian Boult]] is listed as the conductor of the score in the film's credits, but he could not conduct most of the score, due in part to his failure to adapt to the intricate timings of each cue, and Jarre replaced him as the conductor.

It was intended for Soviet composer [[Aram Khachaturian]] to create one half and British composer [[Benjamin Britten]] to write the other.<ref>BFI Film Classics \u2013 Lawrence Of Arabia Kevin Jackson pp90 2007</ref>\n\nThe original soundtrack recording was originally released on [[Colpix Records]], the records division of Columbia Pictures, in 1962. A remastered edition appeared on [[Castle Music]], a division of the [[Sanctuary Records]] Group, on 28 August 2006.\n\n[[Kenneth J. Alford|Kenneth Alford]]'s march ''[[The Voice of the Guns]]'' (1917) is prominently featured on the soundtrack. One of Alford's other pieces, the ''[[Colonel Bogey March]]'', was the musical theme for Lean's previous film ''[[The Bridge on the River Kwai]]''.\n\nA complete recording of the score was not heard until 2010 when Tadlow Music produced a CD of the music, with Nic Raine conducting the [[City of Prague Philharmonic]] from scores reconstructed by [[Leigh Phillips]].\n\n== Release ==\n=== Theatrical run ===\nThe film premiered at the [[Odeon Leicester Square]] in London on 10 December 1962 (Royal Premiere) and was released in the United States on 16 December 1962.\n\nThe original release ran for about 222&nbsp;minutes (plus overture, intermission, and exit music). A post-premiere memo (13 December 1962) noted that the film was 24,987.5&nbsp;ft (70&nbsp;mm) and 19,990&nbsp;ft (35&nbsp;mm). With 90&nbsp;ft of 35&nbsp;mm film projected every minute, this corresponds to exactly 222.11 minutes. Richard May, VP Film Preservation at Warner Bros., sent an email to Robert Morris, co-author of a book on ''Lawrence of Arabia'', in which he noted that ''Gone With the Wind'' was never edited after its premiere and is 19,884&nbsp;ft of 35&nbsp;mm film (without leaders, overture, intermission, entr'acte, or walkout music), corresponding to 220.93 min. Thus, ''Lawrence of Arabia'' is slightly more than 1 minute longer than ''Gone With the Wind'' and is, therefore, the longest movie ever to win a Best Picture Oscar.\n\nIn January 1963, ''Lawrence'' was released in a version edited by 20 minutes; when it was re-released in 1971, an even shorter cut of 187&nbsp;minutes was presented. The first round of cuts was made at the direction and even insistence of David Lean, to assuage criticisms of the film's length and increase the number of showings per day; however, during the 1989 restoration, he passed blame for the cuts onto deceased producer Sam Spiegel.<ref>{{Harvnb|Brownlow|1996|pages=484, 705, 709}}</ref> In addition, a 1966 print was used for initial television and video releases which accidentally altered a few scenes by reversing the image.<ref>Caton, S.C.

Harris]] and Jim Painten under the supervision of director David Lean. It was released in 1989 with a 216-minute length (plus overture, intermission, and exit music).\n\nMost of the cut scenes were dialogue sequences, particularly those involving General Allenby and his staff. Two whole scenes were completely excised\u2014Brighton's briefing of Allenby in Jerusalem before the Deraa scene and the British staff meeting in the field tent\u2014and the Allenby-briefing scene has still not been entirely restored. Much of the missing dialogue involves Lawrence's writing of poetry and verse, alluded to by Allenby in particular, saying \"the last poetry general we had was [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Wellington]]\". The opening of Act II existed in only fragmented form, where Faisal is interviewed by Bentley, as well as the later scene in Jerusalem where Allenby convinces Lawrence not to resign. Both scenes were restored to the 1989 re-release. Some of the more graphic shots of the Tafas massacre scene were also restored, such as the lengthy panning shot of the corpses in Tafas, and Lawrence shooting a surrendering Turkish soldier. Most of the still-missing footage is of minimal import, supplementing existing scenes. One scene is an extended version of the Deraa torture sequence, which makes Lawrence's punishment more overt in that scene. Other scripted scenes exist, including a conversation between Auda and Lawrence immediately after the fall of [[Aqaba]], a brief scene of Turkish officers noting the extent of Lawrence's campaign, and the battle of [[Petra]] (later reworked into the first train attack), but these scenes were probably not filmed. The actors still living at the time of the re-release dubbed their own dialogue, though [[Jack Hawkins]]'s dialogue had to be dubbed by [[Charles Gray (actor)|Charles Gray]], who had already provided Hawkins' voice for several films after Hawkins developed throat cancer in the late 1960s.

Directed by [[David Lean]] and produced by [[Sam Spiegel]] through his British company [[Horizon Pictures]] and Columbia Pictures, with the screenplay by [[Robert Bolt]] and [[Michael Wilson (writer)|Michael Wilson]], it stars [[Peter O'Toole]] in the title role and [[Alec Guinness]] as [[Faisal I of Iraq|Prince Faisal]]. The film, a British and American co-production,<ref name=\"britannica.com\">[https://www.britannica.com/topic/Lawrence-of-Arabia-film-by-Lean \"Lawrence of Arabia (1962)\"], ''[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Online]]''.</ref><ref name=\"bfi.org.uk\">[https://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b6aea50ea \"Lawrence of Arabia (1962)\"], ''[[British Film Institute]]''.</ref><ref name=\"dfi.dk\">[https://www.dfi.dk/en/viden-om-film/filmdatabasen/film/lawrence-arabia \"Lawrence of Arabia (1962)\"], ''[[Danish Film Institute]]''.</ref> depicts Lawrence's experiences in the [[Ottoman Empire]]'s provinces of [[Hejaz Vilayet|Hejaz]] and [[Greater Syria]] during [[World War I]], in particular his attacks on [[Aqaba]] and [[Damascus]] and his involvement in the [[Arab National Council]]. Its themes include Lawrence's emotional struggles with the personal violence inherent in war, his own identity, and his divided allegiance between his native Britain and its army, and his new-found comrades within the Arabian desert tribes. The film also stars [[Jack Hawkins]], [[Anthony Quinn]], [[Omar Sharif]], [[Anthony Quayle]], [[Claude Rains]] and [[Arthur Kennedy]].\n\n''Lawrence of Arabia'' was nominated for ten [[Academy Awards|Oscars]] at the [[35th Academy Awards]] in 1963; it won seven, including Best Picture and Best Director. It also won the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture \u2013 Drama]] and the [[British Academy Film Awards|BAFTA Awards]] for Best Film and Outstanding British Film. In the years since, it has been recognised as one of the greatest and most influential films in the history of cinema. The dramatic score by [[Maurice Jarre]] and the [[Super Panavision 70]] cinematography by [[Freddie Young]] are also highly acclaimed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.emovieposter.com/gallery/inc/archive_image.php?id=5108958|title=eMoviePoster.com Image For: 2g105 Lawrence of Arabia pre-Awards British quad '62 David Lean classic, Peter O'Toole, best art! |work=emovieposter.com |accessdate=8 March 2016|url-access=registration}}</ref> In 1991, ''Lawrence of Arabia'' was deemed \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\" and selected for preservation in the US Library of Congress [[National Film Registry]].<ref>{{cite news | last=Andrews | first=Robert M. | url=http://articles.latimes.com/1991-09-26/entertainment/ca-4030_1_national-film-registry | title=Cinema: 'Lawrence of Arabia' is among those selected for preservation by Library of Congress | work=[[Los Angeles Times]] | date=26 September 1991 | accessdate=4 September 2015 }}</ref> In 1998, the [[American Film Institute]] placed it 5th on their [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Movies|100 Years...100 Movies]] list of the greatest American films, and it ranked 7th on their 2007 updated list. In 1999, the [[British Film Institute]] named the film the [[BFI Top 100 British films|third-greatest British film of all time]]. In 2004, it was voted the [[List of films considered the best|best British film of all time]] in a ''[[Sunday Telegraph]]'' poll of Britain's leading filmmakers.\n\n== Plot ==\nThe film is presented in two parts, divided by an [[Intermission#Films|intermission]].\n\n=== Part I ===\nThe film opens in 1935 when Lawrence is killed in a [[motorcycle accident]]. At his memorial service at [[St Paul's Cathedral]], a reporter tries (with little success) to gain insights into this remarkable, enigmatic man from those who knew him.\n\nThe story then moves back to the [[World War I|First World War]], where Lawrence is a misfit [[British Army]] [[Lieutenant (British Army and Royal Marines)|lieutenant]], notable for his insolence and education. Over the objections of [[Archibald Murray|General Murray]], [[Mr Dryden]] of the [[Arab Bureau]] sends him to assess the prospects of [[Faisal I of Iraq|Prince Faisal]] in [[Arab Revolt|his revolt]] against the [[Ottoman Empire|Turks]]. On the journey, his [[Bedouin people|Bedouin]] guide, Tafas, is killed by Sherif Ali for drinking from his well without permission. Lawrence later meets Colonel Brighton, who orders him to keep quiet, make his assessment, and leave. Lawrence ignores Brighton's orders when he meets Faisal. His outspokenness piques the prince's interest.\n\nBrighton advises Faisal to retreat after a major defeat, but Lawrence proposes a daring [[Battle of Aqaba|surprise attack on Aqaba]]; its capture would provide a port from which the British could offload much-needed supplies. The town is strongly fortified against a naval assault but only lightly defended on the landward side. He convinces Faisal to provide fifty men, led by a sceptical<!-- This is not an error; sceptical is the correct British spelling --> Sherif Ali. Teenage orphans Daud and Farraj attach themselves to Lawrence as servants. They cross the [[Nefud Desert]], considered impassable even by the Bedouins, travelling day and night on the last stage to reach water. One of Ali's men, Gasim, succumbs to fatigue and falls off his camel unnoticed during the night. When Lawrence discovers him missing, he turns back and rescues Gasim\u2014and Sherif Ali is won over. He gives Lawrence Arab robes to wear.\n\nLawrence persuades [[Auda abu Tayi]], the leader of the powerful local [[Howeitat]] tribe, to turn against the Turks. Lawrence's scheme is almost derailed when one of Ali's men kills one of Auda's because of a [[blood feud]]. Howeitat retaliation would shatter the fragile alliance, so Lawrence declares that he will execute the murderer himself. He is then stunned to discover that the culprit is Gasim, the very man he risked his own life to save in the desert, but he shoots him anyway.\n\nThe next morning, the Arabs overrun the Turkish [[garrison]]. Lawrence heads to [[Cairo]] to inform Dryden and the new commander, [[Edmund Allenby, 1st Viscount Allenby|General Allenby]], of his victory. While crossing the [[Sinai Desert]], Daud dies when he stumbles into [[Dry quicksand|quicksand]]. Lawrence is promoted to [[Major (United Kingdom)|major]] and given arms and money for the Arabs. He is deeply disturbed, confessing that he enjoyed executing Gasim, but Allenby brushes aside his qualms. He asks Allenby whether there is any basis for the Arabs' suspicions that the [[Sykes\u2013Picot Agreement|British have designs on Arabia]]. When pressed, the general states that they do not.\n\n=== Part II ===\nLawrence launches a [[guerrilla war]], blowing up trains and harassing the Turks at every turn. [[United States|American]] [[war correspondent]] Jackson Bentley publicises Lawrence's exploits, making him famous. On one raid, Farraj is badly injured. Unwilling to leave him to be tortured by the enemy, Lawrence shoots him dead before fleeing.\n\nWhen Lawrence scouts the enemy-held city of [[Daraa|Deraa]] with Ali, he is taken, along with several Arab residents, to the Turkish [[Bey]]. Lawrence is stripped, ogled, and prodded. Then, for striking out at the Bey, he is severely [[Flogging|flogged]] before being thrown into the street. The experience leaves Lawrence shaken. He returns to British headquarters in Cairo but does not fit in.\n\nA short time later in [[Jerusalem]], General Allenby urges him to support the \"big push\" on [[Damascus]]. Lawrence hesitates to return but finally relents.\n\nLawrence recruits an army that is motivated more by money than by the Arab cause. They sight a column of retreating Turkish soldiers who have just [[Tafas massacre|massacred the residents of Tafas]]. One of Lawrence's men is from [[Tafas]]; he demands, \"No prisoners!\" When Lawrence hesitates, the man charges the Turks alone and is killed. Lawrence takes up the dead man's battle cry; the result is a slaughter in which Lawrence himself participates. Afterwards, he regrets his actions.\n\nLawrence's men take Damascus ahead of Allenby's forces. The Arabs set up a council to administer the city, but the desert tribesmen prove ill-suited for such a task. Despite Lawrence's efforts, they bicker constantly. Unable to maintain the [[Public utility|public utilities]], the Arabs soon abandon most of the city to the British.\n\nLawrence is promoted to [[Colonel (United Kingdom)|colonel]] and immediately ordered back to Britain, as his usefulness to both Faisal and the British is at an end. As he leaves the city, his automobile is passed by a motorcyclist who leaves a trail of dust in his wake.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Peter O'Toole]] as [[T. E. Lawrence]]. [[Albert Finney]] was a virtual unknown at the time, but he was Lean's first choice to play Lawrence. Finney was cast and began principal photography but was fired after two days for reasons that are still unclear.  [[Marlon Brando]] was also offered the part, and [[Anthony Perkins]] and [[Montgomery Clift]] were briefly considered before O'Toole was cast.<ref>{{Harvnb|Turner|1994|pages=41\u201345}}</ref> [[Alec Guinness]] had previously played Lawrence in the play ''[[Ross (play)|Ross]]'' and was briefly considered for the part, but David Lean and Sam Spiegel thought him too old. Lean had seen O'Toole in ''[[The Day They Robbed the Bank of England]]'' and was bowled over by his screen test, proclaiming \"This ''is'' Lawrence!\" Spiegel disliked Montgomery Clift, having worked with him on ''[[Suddenly, Last Summer (film)|Suddenly, Last Summer]].'' Spiegel eventually acceded to Lean's choice, though he disliked O'Toole after seeing him in an unsuccessful screen test for ''Suddenly, Last Summer.''<ref>{{Cite book|title=David Lean: Interviews|last=Lean|first=David|publisher=University Press of Mississippi|year=2009|isbn=978-1-60473-234-4|location=|page=125}}</ref> Pictures of Lawrence suggest also that O'Toole bore some resemblance to him,<ref name=\"Woolf\">{{cite website | last=Woolf | first=Christopher | url=https://www.pri.org/stories/2013-12-16/peter-otooles-lawrence-arabia-fact-or-fiction | title=Is Peter O'Toole's Lawrence of Arabia fact or fiction?| website=[[Public Radio International|PRI]] | date=16 December 2013 }}</ref> in spite of their considerable height difference. O'Toole's looks prompted a different reaction from [[No\u00ebl Coward]], who quipped after seeing the premi\u00e8re of the film, \"If you had been any prettier, the film would have been called Florence of Arabia\".<ref>{{cite journal | last=Lane | first=Anthony | url=http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/atlarge/2008/03/31/080331crat_atlarge_lane | title=Master and Commander | journal=[[The New Yorker]] | date=31 March 2008 }}</ref>\n* [[Alec Guinness]] as [[Faisal I of Iraq|Prince Faisal]]. Faisal was originally to be portrayed by [[Laurence Olivier]]. Guinness performed in other David Lean films, and he got the part when Olivier dropped out. Guinness was made up to look as much like the real Faisal as possible; he recorded in his diaries that, while shooting in Jordan, he met several people who had known Faisal who actually mistook him for the late prince. Guinness said in interviews that he developed his Arab accent from a conversation that he had with Omar Sharif.\n* [[Anthony Quinn]] as [[Auda ibu Tayi|Auda abu Tayi]]. Quinn got very much into his role; he spent hours applying his own makeup, using a photograph of the real Auda to make himself look as much like him as he could. One anecdote has Quinn arriving on-set for the first time in full costume, whereupon Lean mistook him for a native and asked his assistant to ring Quinn and notify him that they were replacing him with the new arrival.\n* [[Jack Hawkins]] as [[Edmund Allenby, 1st Viscount Allenby|General Allenby]]. Sam Spiegel pushed Lean to cast [[Cary Grant]] or [[Laurence Olivier]] (who was engaged at the [[Chichester Festival Theatre]] and declined). Lean convinced him to choose Hawkins because of his work for them on ''[[The Bridge on the River Kwai]]''. Hawkins shaved his head for the role and reportedly clashed with Lean several times during filming.  Guinness recounted that Hawkins was reprimanded by Lean for celebrating the end of a day's filming with an impromptu dance. Hawkins became close friends with O'Toole during filming, and the two often improvised dialogue during takes to Lean's dismay.\n* [[Omar Sharif]] as Sherif Ali. The role was offered to many actors before Sharif was cast. [[Horst Buchholz]] was the first choice, but had already signed on for the film ''[[One, Two, Three]]''. [[Alain Delon]] had a successful screen test but ultimately declined because of the brown contact lenses he would have had to wear. [[Maurice Ronet]] and [[Dilip Kumar]] were also considered.<ref>{{Harvnb|Turner|1994|pages=45\u201349}}</ref> Sharif, who was already a major star in the Middle East, was originally cast as Lawrence's guide Tafas, but when the aforementioned actors proved unsuitable, Sharif was shifted to the part of Ali.\n* [[Jos\u00e9 Ferrer]] as the Turkish Bey. Ferrer was initially unsatisfied with the small size of his part and accepted the role only on the condition of being paid $25,000 (more than O'Toole and Sharif combined) plus a [[Porsche]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Turner|1994|p=49}}</ref> However, he afterwards considered this his best film performance, saying in an interview: \"If I was to be judged by any one film performance, it would be my five minutes in ''Lawrence''.\" Peter O'Toole once said that he learned more about screen acting from Ferrer than he could in any acting class.\n* [[Anthony Quayle]] as Colonel [[Harry Brighton]]. Quayle, a veteran of military roles, was cast after Jack Hawkins, the original choice, was shifted to the part of Allenby.

In the early days of the production, when the Bentley character had a more prominent role in the film, [[Kirk Douglas]] was considered for the part; Douglas expressed interest but demanded a star salary and the highest billing after O'Toole and thus was turned down by Spiegel. Later, [[Edmond O'Brien]] was cast in the part.<ref>{{Harvnb|Turner|1994|p=51}}</ref> O'Brien filmed the Jerusalem scene, and (according to Omar Sharif) Bentley's political discussion with Ali, but he suffered a heart attack on location and had to be replaced at the last moment by Kennedy, who was recommended to Lean by Anthony Quinn.<ref>{{Harvnb|Turner|1994|pages=137\u201338}}</ref>\n* [[Donald Wolfit]] as [[Archibald Murray|General Murray]]\n* [[I.

E. Lawrence]]\n* [[Faisal I of Iraq|Prince Faisal]]\n* [[Auda Abu Tayi]]\n* [[Edmund Allenby, 1st Viscount Allenby|General Allenby]]\n* [[Archibald Murray|General Murray]]\n* Farraj and Daud, Lawrence's servants\n* Gasim, the man whom Lawrence rescues from the desert\n* Talal, who charges the Turkish column at Tafas\n\n; Fictional characters\n* Sherif Ali: A combination of numerous Arab leaders, particularly Sharif Nassir\u2014Faisal's cousin\u2014who led the Harith forces involved in the attack on [[Aqaba]]. The character was created largely because Lawrence did not serve with any one Arab leader (aside from Auda) throughout the majority of the war; most such leaders were amalgamated in Ali's character.\n* Mr Dryden: The cynical [[Arab Bureau]] official was based loosely on numerous figures, including [[Ronald Storrs|Sir Ronald Storrs]], who was head of the Arab Bureau and later the governor of [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine]]. It was largely Storrs' doing that Lawrence first met Faisal and became involved with the Revolt. This character is also partially based upon Lawrence's archaeologist friend [[D. G. Hogarth]], as well as [[Henry McMahon (diplomat)|Henry McMahon]], who historically fulfilled Dryden's role as a political liaison. He was created by the screenwriters to \"represent the civilian and political wing of British interests, to balance Allenby's military objectives.\"\n* Colonel Brighton: In essence a composite of all of the British officers who served in the Middle East with Lawrence, most notably Lt. Col. [[S.F. Newcombe]]. Newcombe played much the same role as Brighton does in the film, being Lawrence's predecessor as liaison to the Arab Revolt; he and many of his men were captured by the Turks in 1916, but he later escaped. Also, like Brighton, Newcombe was not well liked by the Arabs, though he remained friends with Lawrence. (In Michael Wilson's original script, he ''was'' Colonel Newcombe; the character's name was changed by Robert Bolt.) Brighton was apparently created to represent how ordinary British soldiers would feel about a man like Lawrence: impressed by his accomplishments but repulsed by his affected manner. (Lean argued that Brighton was \"the only honourable character\" in the film, whereas [[Anthony Quayle]] referred to his character as an \"idiot\".)\n* Turkish Bey: The Turkish Bey who captures Lawrence in [[Deraa]] was\u2014according to Lawrence himself\u2014General Hajim Bey (in Turkish, ''Hacim Muhiddin Bey''), though he is not named in the film. The incident was mentioned in ''Seven Pillars of Wisdom''. Some biographers ([[Jeremy Wilson]], [[John E. Mack|John Mack]]) argue that Lawrence's account is to be believed; others ([[Michael Asher (explorer)|Michael Asher]], [[Lawrence James]]) argue that contemporary evidence suggests that Lawrence never went to Deraa at this time and that the story is invented.\n* Jackson Bentley: Based on famed American journalist [[Lowell Thomas]], who helped make Lawrence famous with accounts of his bravery. However, Thomas was a young man at the time who spent only a few days (or weeks at most) with Lawrence in the field\u2014unlike Bentley, who is depicted as a cynical middle-aged Chicago newspaperman who is present during the whole of Lawrence's later campaigns. Bentley was the narrator in Wilson's original script, but Bolt reduced his role significantly for the final script. Thomas did not start reporting on Lawrence until after the end of World War I, and held Lawrence in high regard, unlike Bentley, who seems to view Lawrence in terms of a story that he can write about.\n* Tafas: Lawrence's guide to Faisal is based on his actual guide Sheikh Obeid el-Rashid of the Hazimi branch of the Beni Salem, whom Lawrence referred to as Tafas several times in ''Seven Pillars''.\n* Medical officer: This unnamed officer who confronts Lawrence in Damascus is based on an officer mentioned in an incident in ''Seven Pillars of Wisdom''. Lawrence's meeting the officer again while in British uniform was an invention of Wilson or Bolt.\n\n== Historical accuracy ==\nMost of the film's characters are based on actual people to varying degrees. Some scenes were heavily fictionalised, such as the [[Battle of Aqaba|attack on Aqaba]], while those dealing with the Arab Council were inaccurate, inasmuch as the council remained more or less in power in [[Syria]] until France deposed Faisal in 1920. Little background is provided on the history of the region, the First World War, and the Arab Revolt, probably because of Bolt's increased focus on Lawrence (while Wilson's draft script had a broader, more politicised version of events). The second half of the film portrayed a completely fictional depiction of Lawrence's Arab army deserting almost to a man as he moved farther north. The film's timeline is frequently questionable on the [[Arab Revolt]] and [[World War I]], as well as the geography of the [[Hejaz]] region. For instance, Bentley interviews Faisal in late 1917, after the fall of Aqaba, saying that the United States has not yet entered the war, yet the US had been in the war for several months by that time. Further, Lawrence's involvement in the Arab Revolt prior to the attack on Aqaba is completely excised, such as his involvement in the seizures of [[Yenbo]] and [[Wejh]]. The rescue and execution of Gasim are based on two separate incidents, which were conflated for dramatic reasons.\n\nThe film shows Lawrence representing the Allied cause in the Hejaz almost alone, with Colonel Brighton ([[Anthony Quayle]]) the only British officer there to assist him. In fact, there were numerous British officers such as colonels Cyril Wilson, Stewart Francis Newcombe, and Pierce C. Joyce, all of whom arrived before Lawrence began serving in Arabia.<ref>Murphy, David ''The Arab Revolt 1916\u20131918'', London: Osprey, 2008. p. 17</ref> In addition, there was a French military mission led by Colonel Edouard Br\u00e9mond serving in the Hejaz, of which no mention is made in the film.<ref>Murphy, David ''The Arab Revolt 1916\u20131918'', London: Osprey, 2008. p. 18</ref> The film shows Lawrence as the sole originator of the attacks on the Hejaz railroad. The first attacks on this began in early January 1917 led by officers such as Newcombe.<ref>Murphy, David ''The Arab Revolt 1916\u20131918'', London: Osprey, 2008. p. 39</ref> The first successful attack on the Hejaz railroad with a locomotive-destroying \"Garland mine\" was led by Major [[Herbert Garland]] in February 1917, a month before Lawrence's first attack.<ref>Murphy, David ''The Arab Revolt 1916\u20131918'', London: Osprey, 2008. pp. 43\u201344</ref>\n\nThe film shows the [[Hashemite]] forces as consisting of Bedouin guerrillas, whereas the core of the Hashemite forces was the regular Arab Army recruited from Ottoman Arab prisoners of war, who wore British-style uniforms with [[keffiyeh]]s and fought in conventional battles.<ref>Murphy, David ''The Arab Revolt 1916\u20131918'', London: Osprey, 2008 p. 24</ref> The film makes no mention of the [[Sharifian Army]], and leaves the viewer with the impression that the Hashemite forces were composed exclusively of Bedouin irregulars.\n\n=== Representation of Lawrence ===\n[[File:Peter O'Toole in Lawrence of Arabia.png|thumb|upright=1.15|left|[[Peter O'Toole]] as T. E. Lawrence]]\nMany complaints about the film's accuracy concern the characterisation of Lawrence. The perceived problems with the portrayal begin with the differences in his physical appearance; the {{convert|6|ft|2|in|m|adj=on}} [[Peter O'Toole]] was almost {{convert|9|in|cm}} taller than the {{convert|5|ft|5|in|m|adj=on}} Lawrence.<ref>{{cite book | last = Orlans | first = Harold | title = T. E. Lawrence: Biography of a Broken Hero | publisher = McFarland | page = 111 | date = 2002 | isbn = 0-7864-1307-7 }}</ref> His behaviour, however, has caused much more debate.\n\nThe screenwriters depict Lawrence as an egotist. It is not clear to what degree Lawrence sought or shunned attention, as evident in his use of various assumed names after the war. Even during the war, [[Lowell Thomas]] wrote in ''With Lawrence in Arabia'' that he could take pictures of him only by tricking him, although Lawrence did later agree to pose for several photos for Thomas's stage show. Thomas's famous comment that Lawrence \"had a genius for backing into the limelight\" can be taken to suggest that his extraordinary actions prevented him from being as private as he would have liked, or it can be taken to suggest that Lawrence made a pretence of avoiding the limelight while subtly placing himself at centre stage. Others point to Lawrence's own writings to support the argument that he was egotistical.\n\nLawrence's sexual orientation remains a controversial topic among historians. Bolt's primary source was ostensibly ''Seven Pillars'', but the film's portrayal seems informed by [[Richard Aldington]]'s ''Biographical Inquiry'' (1955) which posited Lawrence as a \"pathological liar and exhibitionist\", as well as a homosexual. This is opposed to his portrayal in ''Ross'' as \"physically and spiritually recluse\".<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Weintraub|first=Stanley|year=1964|title=Lawrence of Arabia|jstor=1210914|journal=Film Quarterly|volume=17|issue=3|pages=51\u201354|doi=10.2307/1210914}}</ref> Historians such as [[Basil Liddell Hart]] disputed the film's depiction of Lawrence as an active participant in the attack and slaughter of the retreating Turkish columns who had committed the [[Tafas massacre]], but most current biographers accept the film's portrayal as reasonably accurate.\n\nThe film does show that Lawrence could speak and read Arabic, could quote the [[Quran]], and was reasonably knowledgeable about the region. It barely mentions his archaeological travels from 1911 to 1914 in Syria and Arabia and ignores his espionage work, including a pre-war topographical survey of the Sinai Peninsula and his attempts to negotiate the release of British prisoners at [[Siege of Kut|Kut]] in [[Mesopotamia]] in 1916. Furthermore, Lawrence is made aware of the [[Sykes\u2013Picot Agreement]] very late in the story and is shown to be appalled by it, whereas he actually knew about it much earlier while fighting alongside the Arabs.<ref>cf. Jeremy Wilson, ''Lawrence of Arabia: The Authorised Biography of T. E. Lawrence'' (1990), pp. 409\u201310</ref>\n\nLawrence's biographers have a mixed reaction towards the film. Authorised biographer Jeremy Wilson noted that the film has \"undoubtedly influenced the perceptions of some subsequent biographers\", such as the depiction of the film's Ali being real rather than a composite character, and also highlighting the Deraa incident.<ref>{{cite web | last=Wilson | first=Jeremy | url=http://www.telstudies.org/discussion/film_tv_radio/lofa_or_sid_1.shtml | title=Lawrence of Arabia or Smith in the Desert? | publisher=T. E. Lawrence Studies | accessdate=9 July 2015 }}</ref> The film's historical inaccuracies, in Wilson's view, are more troublesome than should be allowed under normal dramatic licence. At the time, Liddell Hart publicly criticised the film, engaging Bolt in a lengthy correspondence over its portrayal of Lawrence.<ref>L. Robert Morris and Lawrence Raskin. ''Lawrence of Arabia: The 30th Anniversary Pictorial History.'' pp. 149\u201356</ref>\n\n=== Representation of other characters ===\n{{more citations needed|section|date=March 2019}}\nThe film portrays General Allenby as cynical and manipulative, with a superior attitude to Lawrence, but there is much evidence that Allenby and Lawrence liked and respected one another. Lawrence once said that Allenby was \"an admiration of mine\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.castlehillpress.com/plates/pl01.htm |title=''The Seven Pillars'' Portraits |publisher=castlehillpress.com}}</ref> and later that he was \"physically large and confident and morally so great that the comprehension of our littleness came slow to him\".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/lawrenceofarabia/players/allenby.html |title=General Allenby (biography) |publisher=pbs.org}}</ref> The fictional Allenby's words at Lawrence's funeral in the film stand in contrast to the real Allenby's remarks upon Lawrence's death: \"I have lost a good friend and a valued comrade. Lawrence was under my command, but, after acquainting him with my strategical plan, I gave him a free hand. His co-operation was marked by the utmost loyalty, and I never had anything but praise for his work, which, indeed, was invaluable throughout the campaign.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/lawrenceofarabia/players/allenby2.html |title=General Allenby (radio interview) |publisher=pbs.org}}</ref> Allenby also spoke highly of him numerous times and, much to Lawrence's delight, publicly endorsed the accuracy of ''Seven Pillars of Wisdom''. Allenby did manipulate Lawrence during the war, but their relationship lasted for years after its end, indicating that in real life they were friendly, if not close. The Allenby family was particularly upset by the Damascus scenes, where Allenby coldly allows the town to fall into chaos as the Arab Council collapses.<ref>Steven C. Caton, ''Lawrence of Arabia: A Film's Anthropology'', p. 59</ref>\n\nSimilarly, General Murray was initially sceptical of the Arab Revolt's potential, but he thought highly of Lawrence's abilities as an intelligence officer; indeed, it was largely through Lawrence's persuasion that Murray came to support the revolt. The intense dislike shown toward Lawrence in the film is in fact the opposite of Murray's real feelings, although for his part Lawrence seemed not to hold Murray in any high regard.\n\nThe depiction of Auda abu Tayi as a man interested only in loot and money is also at odds with the historical record. Auda did at first join the revolt for monetary reasons, but he quickly became a steadfast supporter of Arab independence, notably after Aqaba's capture. He refused repeated bribery attempts by the Turks (though he happily pocketed their money) and remained loyal to the revolt, going so far as to knock out his false teeth, which were Turkish made. He was present with Lawrence from the beginning of the Aqaba expedition and in fact helped plan it along with Lawrence and Prince Faisal.\n\nFaisal was far from being the middle-aged man depicted and was in his early 30s at the time of the revolt. Faisal and Lawrence respected each other's capabilities and intelligence. They worked well together.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/lawrenceofarabia/players/feisal.html |title=Prince Feisal |publisher=pbs.org}}</ref>\n\nThe reactions of those who knew Lawrence and the other characters say much about the film's veracity.  The most vehement critic of its accuracy was Professor [[A. W. Lawrence|A. W. (Arnold) Lawrence]], the protagonist's younger brother and literary executor, who had sold the rights to ''Seven Pillars of Wisdom'' to Spiegel for \u00a325,000. Arnold Lawrence went on a campaign in the United States and Britain denouncing the film, famously saying, \"I should not have recognised my own brother\". In one pointed talk show appearance, he remarked that he had found the film \"pretentious and false\". He went on to say that his brother was \"one of the nicest, kindest and most exhilarating people I've known. He often appeared cheerful when he was unhappy.\" Later, Arnold said to the ''[[New York Times]]'', \"[The film is] a psychological recipe. Take an ounce of narcissism, a pound of exhibitionism, a pint of sadism, a gallon of blood-lust and a sprinkle of other aberrations and stir well.\" Lowell Thomas was also critical of the portrayal of Lawrence and most of the film's characters, believing that the train attack scenes were the only reasonably accurate aspect of the film.\n\nThe criticisms were not restricted to Lawrence. The Allenby family lodged a formal complaint against Columbia about the portrayal of him. Descendants of Auda abu Tayi and the real Sherif Ali, Sharif Nassir, went further, suing Columbia despite the fact that the film's Ali was a fictional composite character. The Auda case went on for almost 10 years before it was dropped.<ref>Adrian Turner, ''Robert Bolt: Scenes From Two Lives'', 201\u201306</ref>\n\nThe film has its defenders. Biographer [[Michael Korda]], author of ''Hero: The Life and Legend of Lawrence of Arabia'', offers a different opinion. The film is neither \"the full story of Lawrence's life or a completely accurate account of the two years he spent fighting with the Arabs,\" yet Korda argues that criticising its inaccuracy \"misses the point\": \"The object was to produce, not a faithful docudrama that would educate the audience, but a hit picture.\"<ref>Korda, pp. 693\u201394</ref> Stephen E. Tabachnick goes further than Korda, arguing that the film's portrayal of Lawrence is \"appropriate and true to the text of ''Seven Pillars of Wisdom''\".<ref>''Lawrence of Arabia: An Encyclopedia.'' Westport, CT: Greenwood, Press, 2004. p. 24</ref> British historian of the Arab Revolt David Murphy wrote that although the film was flawed due to various inaccuracies and omissions, \"it was a truly epic movie and is rightly seen as a classic\".<ref>Murphy, David ''The Arab Revolt'', Osprey: London, 2008 pp. 88\u201389</ref>\n\n== Production ==\n=== Pre-production ===\nPrevious films about T. E. Lawrence had been planned but had not been made. In the 1940s, [[Alexander Korda]] was interested in filming ''The Seven Pillars of Wisdom'' with [[Laurence Olivier]], [[Leslie Howard (actor)|Leslie Howard]], or [[Robert Donat]] as Lawrence, but had to pull out owing to financial difficulties. David Lean had been approached to direct a 1952 version for the [[Rank Organisation]], but the project fell through.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Beyond the Epic: The Life & Films of David Lean|last=Phillips|first=Gene D.|publisher=The University Press of Kentucky|year=2006|isbn=978-0-8131-2415-5|location=Lexington|page=258|quote=|via=}}</ref> At the same time as pre-production of the film, [[Terence Rattigan]] was developing his play ''[[Ross (play)|Ross]]'' which centred primarily on Lawrence's alleged [[homosexuality]]. ''Ross'' had begun as a screenplay, but was re-written for the stage when the film project fell through. Sam Spiegel grew furious and attempted to have the play suppressed, which helped to gain publicity for the film.<ref>{{Harvnb|Brownlow|1996|pages=410\u201311}}</ref> [[Dirk Bogarde]] had accepted the role in ''Ross''; he described the cancellation of the project as \"my bitterest disappointment\". Alec Guinness played the role on stage.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Peter O'Toole: The Definitive Biography|last=Sellers|first=Robert|publisher=Pan Macmillan|year=2015|isbn=978-0-283-07216-1|location=London|pages=|quote=my bitterest disappointment}}</ref>\n\nLean and Sam Spiegel had worked together on ''[[The Bridge on the River Kwai]]'' and decided to collaborate again. For a time, Lean was interested in a biopic of [[Gandhi]], with Alec Guinness to play the title role and [[Emeric Pressburger]] writing the screenplay. He eventually lost interest in the project, despite extensive pre-production work, including location scouting in India and a meeting with [[Jawaharlal Nehru]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Brownlow|1996|pages=393\u2013401}}</ref> Lean then returned his attention to T. E. Lawrence. [[Columbia Pictures]] had an interest in a Lawrence project dating back to the early '50s, and the project got underway when Spiegel convinced a reluctant [[A. W. Lawrence]] to sell the rights to ''[[The Seven Pillars of Wisdom]]'' for \u00a322,500.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Beyond the Epic: The Life and Films of David Lean|last=Phillips|first=Gene D.|publisher=The University Press of Kentucky|year=2006|isbn=978-0-8131-2415-5|location=Lexington|page=271|quote=|via=}}</ref>\n\n[[Michael Wilson (writer)|Michael Wilson]] wrote the original draft of the screenplay. Lean was dissatisfied with Wilson's work, primarily because his treatment focused on the historical and political aspects of the Arab Revolt. Lean hired [[Robert Bolt]] to re-write the script to make it a character study of Lawrence. Many of the characters and scenes are Wilson's invention, but virtually all of the dialogue in the finished film was written by Bolt.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Beyond the Epic: The Life and Films of David Lean|last=Phillips|first=Gene D.|publisher=The University Press of Kentucky|year=2006|isbn=978-0-8131-2415-5|location=Lexington|pages=270\u201382|quote=|via=}}</ref>\n\nLean reportedly watched [[John Ford]]'s film ''[[The Searchers]]'' (1956) to help him develop ideas as to how to shoot the film. Several scenes directly recall Ford's film, most notably Ali's entrance at the well and the composition of many of the desert scenes and the dramatic exit from [[Wadi Rum]]. Lean biographer [[Kevin Brownlow]] notes a physical similarity between Wadi Rum and Ford's [[Monument Valley]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Brownlow|1996|page=443}}</ref>\n\n=== Filming ===\n{{More citations needed section|date=August 2014}}\n\nThe film was made by [[Horizon Pictures]] and [[Columbia Pictures]]. Principal photography began on 15 May 1961 and ended on 21 September 1962.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Beyond the Epic: The Life and Films of David Lean|last=Phillips|first=Gene D.|publisher=The University Press of Kentucky|year=2006|isbn=978-0-8131-2415-5|location=Lexington|pages=291, 303|quote=|via=}}</ref>\n\nThe desert scenes were shot in [[Jordan]] and [[Morocco]], as well as [[Almer\u00eda (province)|Almer\u00eda]] and [[Do\u00f1ana National Park|Do\u00f1ana]] in Spain. It was originally to be filmed entirely in Jordan; the government of [[Hussein of Jordan|King Hussein]] was extremely helpful in providing logistical assistance, location scouting, transportation, and extras. Hussein himself visited the set several times during production and maintained cordial relationships with cast and crew. The only tension occurred when Jordanian officials learned that English actor [[Henry Oscar]] did not speak Arabic but would be filmed reciting the [[Qur'an]]. Permission was granted only on condition that an imam be present to ensure that there were no misquotations.\n\n[[File:Pabellon Mudejar.JPG|thumb|The [[Mud\u00e9jar]] pavilion of the [[Parque de Mar\u00eda Luisa]] in Seville appeared as Damascus.]]\n[[File:Spain Andalusia Seville BW 2015-10-23 15-35-15.jpg|thumb|The [[Plaza de Espa\u00f1a, Seville]] appeared as Britain's Egyptian Expeditionary Force Headquarters in Cairo, which included the officers' club.]]\nLean planned to film in Aqaba and the archaeological site at [[Petra]], which Lawrence had been fond of as a place of study. However, the production had to be moved to Spain due to cost and outbreaks of illness among the cast and crew before these scenes could be shot. The attack on Aqaba was reconstructed in a dried river bed in Playa del Algarrobico, southern Spain (at {{nowrap|{{coord|37|1|25|N|1|52|53|W|region:ES_type:landmark|display=inline}}}}); it consisted of more than 300 buildings and was meticulously based on the town's appearance in 1917. The execution of Gasim, the train attacks, and Deraa exteriors were filmed in the [[Almer\u00eda]] region, with some of the filming being delayed because of a flash flood. The [[Sierra Nevada (Spain)|Sierra Nevada]] mountains filled in for Azrak, Lawrence's winter quarters. The city of [[Seville]] was used to represent [[Cairo]], [[Jerusalem]], and [[Damascus]], with the appearance of [[Casa de Pilatos]], the [[Alc\u00e1zar of Seville]], and the [[Plaza de Espa\u00f1a (Seville)|Plaza de Espa\u00f1a]]. All of the interiors were shot in Spain, including Lawrence's first meeting with Faisal and the scene in Auda's tent. The Tafas massacre was filmed in [[Ouarzazate]], Morocco, with Moroccan army troops substituting for the Turkish army; however, Lean could not film as much as he wanted because the soldiers were uncooperative and impatient.<ref>{{Harvnb|Brownlow|1996|pages=466\u201367}}</ref>\n\nThe film's production was frequently delayed because shooting commenced without a finished script. Wilson quit early in the production, and playwright [[Beverley Cross]] worked on the script in the interim before Bolt took over, although none of Cross's material made it to the final film. A further mishap occurred when Bolt was arrested for taking part in an anti-nuclear weapons demonstration, and Spiegel had to persuade him to sign a recognizance of good behaviour to be released from jail and continue working on the script.\n\nO'Toole was not used to riding camels and found the saddle to be uncomfortable. During a break in filming, he bought a piece of foam rubber at a market and added it to his saddle. Many of the extras copied the idea and sheets of the foam can be seen on many of the horse and camel saddles. The Bedouin nicknamed O'Toole {{\"'}}Ab al-'Isfanjah\" ({{lang|ar|\u0623\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u0625\u0633\u0641\u0646\u062c\u0629}}), meaning \"Father of the Sponge\".<ref>[[Peter O'Toole]], interview on the ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]'', 11 May 1995.</ref> During the filming of the Aqaba scene, O'Toole was nearly killed when he fell from his camel, but it fortunately stood over him, preventing the horses of the extras from trampling him. Coincidentally, a very similar mishap befell the real Lawrence at the [[Battle of Aqaba|Battle of Abu El Lissal]] in 1917.\n\nJordan banned the film for what was felt to be a disrespectful portrayal of Arab culture.<ref name=\"Woolf\" /> Egypt, Omar Sharif's home country, was the only Arab nation to give the film a wide release, where it became a success through the endorsement of President [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]], who appreciated the film's depiction of [[Pan-Arabism|Arab nationalism]].\n\n[[Super Panavision 70|Super Panavision]] technology was used to shoot the film, meaning that spherical lenses were used instead of anamorphic ones, and the image was exposed on a 65&nbsp;mm negative, then printed onto a 70&nbsp;mm positive to leave room for the soundtracks. Rapid cutting was more disturbing on the wide screen, so filmmakers had to apply longer and more fluid takes. Shooting such a wide ratio produced some unwanted effects during projection, such as a peculiar \"flutter\" effect, a blurring of certain parts of the image. To avoid the problem, the director often had to modify blocking, giving the actor a more diagonal movement, where the flutter was less likely to occur.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Lawrence of Arabia: A Film's Anthropology|last=Caton|first=Steven Charles|publisher=University of California Press|year=1950|isbn=0-520-21082-4|location=Los Angeles|pages=70, 71|quote=|via=}}</ref> David Lean was asked whether he could handle [[CinemaScope]]: \"If one had an eye for composition, there would be no problem.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Epic Films of David Lean|last=Santas|first=Constantine|publisher=The Scarecrow Press, Inc.|year=2012|isbn=|location=Plymouth UK|page=xxvi|quote=|via=}}</ref>\n\nO'Toole did not share Lawrence's love of the desert and stated in an interview: \"I loathe it.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUyixfiE_oM|title=Peter O'Toole talks about 'Lawrence of Arabia' in rare 1963 interview|publisher=YouTube|date= |accessdate=2014-11-04}}</ref>\n\n=== Music ===\nThe [[film score]] was composed by [[Maurice Jarre]], little known at the time and selected only after both [[William Walton]] and [[Malcolm Arnold]] had proved unavailable.

[[Adrian Boult|Sir Adrian Boult]] is listed as the conductor of the score in the film's credits, but he could not conduct most of the score, due in part to his failure to adapt to the intricate timings of each cue, and Jarre replaced him as the conductor.

It was intended for Soviet composer [[Aram Khachaturian]] to create one half and British composer [[Benjamin Britten]] to write the other.<ref>BFI Film Classics \u2013 Lawrence Of Arabia Kevin Jackson pp90 2007</ref>\n\nThe original soundtrack recording was originally released on [[Colpix Records]], the records division of Columbia Pictures, in 1962. A remastered edition appeared on [[Castle Music]], a division of the [[Sanctuary Records]] Group, on 28 August 2006.\n\n[[Kenneth J. Alford|Kenneth Alford]]'s march ''[[The Voice of the Guns]]'' (1917) is prominently featured on the soundtrack. One of Alford's other pieces, the ''[[Colonel Bogey March]]'', was the musical theme for Lean's previous film ''[[The Bridge on the River Kwai]]''.\n\nA complete recording of the score was not heard until 2010 when Tadlow Music produced a CD of the music, with Nic Raine conducting the [[City of Prague Philharmonic]] from scores reconstructed by [[Leigh Phillips]].\n\n== Release ==\n=== Theatrical run ===\nThe film premiered at the [[Odeon Leicester Square]] in London on 10 December 1962 (Royal Premiere) and was released in the United States on 16 December 1962.\n\nThe original release ran for about 222&nbsp;minutes (plus overture, intermission, and exit music). A post-premiere memo (13 December 1962) noted that the film was 24,987.5&nbsp;ft (70&nbsp;mm) and 19,990&nbsp;ft (35&nbsp;mm). With 90&nbsp;ft of 35&nbsp;mm film projected every minute, this corresponds to exactly 222.11 minutes. Richard May, VP Film Preservation at Warner Bros., sent an email to Robert Morris, co-author of a book on ''Lawrence of Arabia'', in which he noted that ''Gone With the Wind'' was never edited after its premiere and is 19,884&nbsp;ft of 35&nbsp;mm film (without leaders, overture, intermission, entr'acte, or walkout music), corresponding to 220.93 min. Thus, ''Lawrence of Arabia'' is slightly more than 1 minute longer than ''Gone With the Wind'' and is, therefore, the longest movie ever to win a Best Picture Oscar.\n\nIn January 1963, ''Lawrence'' was released in a version edited by 20 minutes; when it was re-released in 1971, an even shorter cut of 187&nbsp;minutes was presented. The first round of cuts was made at the direction and even insistence of David Lean, to assuage criticisms of the film's length and increase the number of showings per day; however, during the 1989 restoration, he passed blame for the cuts onto deceased producer Sam Spiegel.<ref>{{Harvnb|Brownlow|1996|pages=484, 705, 709}}</ref> In addition, a 1966 print was used for initial television and video releases which accidentally altered a few scenes by reversing the image.<ref>Caton, S.C.

Harris]] and Jim Painten under the supervision of director David Lean. It was released in 1989 with a 216-minute length (plus overture, intermission, and exit music).\n\nMost of the cut scenes were dialogue sequences, particularly those involving General Allenby and his staff. Two whole scenes were completely excised\u2014Brighton's briefing of Allenby in Jerusalem before the Deraa scene and the British staff meeting in the field tent\u2014and the Allenby-briefing scene has still not been entirely restored. Much of the missing dialogue involves Lawrence's writing of poetry and verse, alluded to by Allenby in particular, saying \"the last poetry general we had was [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Wellington]]\". The opening of Act II existed in only fragmented form, where Faisal is interviewed by Bentley, as well as the later scene in Jerusalem where Allenby convinces Lawrence not to resign. Both scenes were restored to the 1989 re-release. Some of the more graphic shots of the Tafas massacre scene were also restored, such as the lengthy panning shot of the corpses in Tafas, and Lawrence shooting a surrendering Turkish soldier. Most of the still-missing footage is of minimal import, supplementing existing scenes. One scene is an extended version of the Deraa torture sequence, which makes Lawrence's punishment more overt in that scene. Other scripted scenes exist, including a conversation between Auda and Lawrence immediately after the fall of [[Aqaba]], a brief scene of Turkish officers noting the extent of Lawrence's campaign, and the battle of [[Petra]] (later reworked into the first train attack), but these scenes were probably not filmed. The actors still living at the time of the re-release dubbed their own dialogue, though [[Jack Hawkins]]'s dialogue had to be dubbed by [[Charles Gray (actor)|Charles Gray]], who had already provided Hawkins' voice for several films after Hawkins developed throat cancer in the late 1960s.

The competition was suspended during World War 2. \n\nIt reformed in 1947 as the 'Western Zone' with teams from [[Hay]], [[Darlington Point]], [[Goolgowi]], [[Carrathool]] and two teams from [[Hillston]], 'Town' and 'Country'. [[Tullibigeal]] joined during the 1950s, and won the 1965 [[Clayton Cup]], the [[Country Rugby League]]'s highest honour, but later departed to form the TLU Sharks with [[Lake Cargelligo]]. Sometime between then and 1965, when Coleambally entered, the league became known as group 17. In 1973, two of the competition's biggest teams, Darlington Point and Coleambally merged and joined the neighbouring [[Group 20 Rugby League]] (Griffith and District) competition. Darlington Point had far outgrown the competition, going undefeated in 1968 to win the Clayton Cup.\n\nThroughout the 1980s and 1990s, the competition sustained a high level of competition, with eight clubs participating. More Clayton Cups were won by Group 17 clubs, with Rankins Springs (1993), Barellan (1999 and 2002) and Hillston (2006) all claiming the trophy. But by the 2000s, the Millennial Drought had caused many of the teams to be weakened, due to farming, the primary industry in the region, becoming not only unprofitable, but almost impossible. The competition collapsed after the 2006 season.\n\nThe competition was revived in 2018 as the Group 17 ProTen Community Cup, with six teams participating. The format involved at five rounds followed by semi-finals and a grand final. In each round, all three games were played at the same venue.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://crlnsw.com.au/proten-community-cup-bringing-rugby-league-back-to-group-17-after-12-years/|title=ProTen Community Cup bringing Rugby League Back to Group 17 after 12 years|date=2 March 2018|website=Country Rugby League|publisher=Daily Advertiser|access-date=13 June 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe competition retained the same format in 2019 (with six rounds instead of five), with the [[Grand Final]] being held in [[Ivanhoe, New South Wales|Ivanhoe]]. The 2020 season is in limbo due to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]]. \n\n==Clubs==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! Club\n! Nickname\n! Home Ground\n! No. of Premierships\n!

The competition was suspended during World War 2. \n\nIt reformed in 1947 as the 'Western Zone' with teams from [[Hay]], [[Darlington Point]], [[Goolgowi]], [[Carrathool]] and two teams from [[Hillston]], 'Town' and 'Country'. [[Tullibigeal]] joined during the 1950s, and won the 1965 [[Clayton Cup]], the [[Country Rugby League]]'s highest honour, but later departed to form the TLU Sharks with [[Lake Cargelligo]]. Sometime between then and 1965, when Coleambally entered, the league became known as group 17. In 1973, two of the competition's biggest teams, Darlington Point and Coleambally merged and joined the neighbouring [[Group 20 Rugby League]] (Griffith and District) competition. Darlington Point had far outgrown the competition, going undefeated in 1968 to win the Clayton Cup.\n\nThroughout the 1980s and 1990s, the competition sustained a high level of competition, with eight clubs participating. More Clayton Cups were won by Group 17 clubs, with Rankins Springs (1993), Barellan (1999 and 2002) and Hillston (2006) all claiming the trophy. But by the 2000s, the Millennial Drought had caused many of the teams to be weakened, due to farming, the primary industry in the region, becoming not only unprofitable, but almost impossible. The competition collapsed after the 2006 season.\n\nThe competition was revived in 2018 as the Group 17 ProTen Community Cup, with six teams participating. The format involved at five rounds followed by semi-finals and a grand final. In each round, all three games were played at the same venue.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://crlnsw.com.au/proten-community-cup-bringing-rugby-league-back-to-group-17-after-12-years/|title=ProTen Community Cup bringing Rugby League Back to Group 17 after 12 years|date=2 March 2018|website=Country Rugby League|publisher=Daily Advertiser|access-date=13 June 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe competition retained the same format in 2019 (with six rounds instead of five), with the [[Grand Final]] being held in [[Ivanhoe, New South Wales|Ivanhoe]]. The 2020 season is in limbo due to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]]. \n\n==Clubs==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! Club\n! Nickname\n! Home Ground\n! No. of Premierships\n!

The story follows a hapless florist shop worker who raises a plant that feeds on human blood and flesh.  The musical is based on the low-budget 1960 [[black comedy]] film ''[[The Little Shop of Horrors]]''.  The music, composed by Menken in the style of early 1960s [[rock and roll]], [[doo-wop]] and early [[Motown Records|Motown]], includes several well-known tunes, including the title song, \"Skid Row (Downtown)\", \"Somewhere That's Green\", and \"Suddenly, Seymour\".\n\nThe musical premiered [[Off-Off-Broadway]] in 1982 before moving to the [[Orpheum Theatre (Manhattan)|Orpheum Theatre]] [[Off-Broadway]], where it had a five-year run.  It later received numerous productions in the U.S. and abroad, and a subsequent [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] production. Because of its small cast, it has become popular with [[community theatre]], school and other amateur groups.<ref>''[[Time (magazine)|TIME magazine]]'' reported in its May 26, 2008 issue, p. 51, that this musical ranked as the most frequently produced musical by U.S. high schools in 2007.</ref>  The musical was also made into a 1986 [[Little Shop of Horrors (film)|film of the same name]], directed by [[Frank Oz]].\n\n==Synopsis==\n\n===Act I===\nAn offstage voice recalls a time when the human race \"suddenly encountered a deadly threat to its very existence\". A trio of 1960s street urchins named Crystal, Ronette, and Chiffon set the scene (\"Little Shop of Horrors\") and comment on the action throughout the show. Seymour Krelborn is a poor young man, an orphan living in an urban [[skid row]]. Audrey is a pretty blonde with a fashion sense that leans towards the tacky. They lament their stations in life and the urban blight in their neighborhood (\"Skid Row (Downtown)\"). They are co-workers at Mushnik's Skid Row Florists, a run-down flower shop owned and operated by the cranky Mr. Mushnik. Seymour has recently obtained a mysterious plant that looks like a large [[venus flytrap]]. While he was browsing the wholesale flower district, a sudden eclipse of the sun occurred, and when the light returned, the weird plant had appeared (\"Da-Doo\"). Seymour, who is secretly in love with Audrey, names the plant Audrey II in her honor.\n\nThe plant does not thrive in its new environment and appears to be dying. Seymour questions why it should be doing poorly, since he takes such good care of it. He accidentally pricks his finger on a rose thorn, which draws blood, and Audrey II's pod opens thirstily. Seymour realizes that Audrey II requires blood to survive and allows the plant to suckle from his finger (\"Grow For Me\"). As Audrey II grows, it becomes an attraction and starts generating brisk business for Mushnik. As the caretaker of the plant, the timid Seymour is suddenly regarded as a hero (\"Ya Never Know\"), while Audrey secretly longs to leave her abusive boyfriend. Her dream is to lead an ideal suburban life with Seymour, complete with a tract home, frozen dinners, and plastic on the furniture (\"Somewhere That's Green\").\n\nMeanwhile, the employees at Mushnik's are sprucing up the flower shop because of the popularity of the rapidly growing Audrey II and the revenue that it is bringing in (\"Closed for Renovation\"). Orin Scrivello, a [[Sadistic personality disorder|sadistic]] [[Dentistry|dentist]], is Audrey's abusive boyfriend. Modeled after the \"Leader of the pack\" characters of the 1950s, Orin drives a motorcycle, wears leather, and enjoys bringing other people pain (\"Dentist!\"). Orin encourages Seymour to take the plant and get out of Skid Row. Realizing that his store's sudden profitability is completely dependent on the plant (and therefore on Seymour), Mushnik takes advantage of Seymour's innocence by offering to adopt him and make him a full partner in the business. Having always wanted a family, Seymour accepts, even though Mushnik has always yelled at him and treated him poorly (\"Mushnik and Son\"). However, Seymour is having difficulty providing enough blood to keep Audrey II healthy. When Seymour stops feeding the plant, Audrey II reveals that it can speak. It demands blood and promises that, if fed, it will make sure that all of Seymour's dreams come true. Seymour initially refuses, but he then witnesses Orin abusing Audrey. The plant presents this as a justification for killing Orin. Not realizing that he is being manipulated again, Seymour gives in to his baser instincts and agrees (\"Feed Me (Git It)\"). \n\nHe sets up a late-night appointment with Orin, intending to kill him. However, Seymour loses his nerve and decides not to commit the crime. Unfortunately for Orin, who is getting high on [[nitrous oxide]], the gas device is stuck in the \"on\" position, and he suffocates while asking Seymour to save him. Seymour cannot bring himself to shoot Orin but lets him die of asphyxiation (\"Now (It's Just The Gas)\"). Seymour feeds Orin's body to the now huge Audrey II, and the plant consumes it with ravenous glee (\"Act I Finale\").\n\n===Act II===\n{{Listen\n|filename=Suddenly, Seymour - 2003 revival.ogg\n|title=\"Suddenly, Seymour\"\n|description=The beginning of the last chorus of \"Suddenly, Seymour\", performed by Kerry Butler and Hunter Foster on the 2003 Broadway revival cast recording.}}\n\nThe flower shop is much busier, and Seymour and Audrey have trouble keeping up with the onslaught of orders (\"Call Back in the Morning\"). Audrey confides to Seymour that she feels guilty about Orin's disappearance, because she secretly wished it. The two admit their feelings for one another, and Seymour promises that he will protect and care for Audrey from now on (\"Suddenly, Seymour\"). The two plan to leave together and start a new life, although Seymour mistakenly attributes Audrey's feelings to his newfound fame, not realizing that she loved him even before he found the plant.\n\nBefore they can go, Mushnik confronts Seymour about Orin's death. Mushnik has put two and two together: the bloody dentist's uniform, the drops of blood on the floor, and he has seen Seymour and Audrey kissing. Seymour denies killing Orin, but Mushnik wants him to give a statement to the police, who have begun investigating. Audrey II tells Seymour that he has to be rid of Mushnik or he will lose everything, including Audrey (\"Suppertime\"). Seymour tells Mushnik that he put the days' receipts inside Audrey II for safekeeping. Mushnik climbs inside the plant's gaping maw to search for the money, realizing the deception too late, and screams as he is devoured. Seymour now runs the flower shop, and reporters, salesmen, lawyers and agents approach him, promising him fame and fortune. Although tempted by the trappings of his success, Seymour realizes that it is only a matter of time before Audrey II will kill again and that he is morally responsible. He considers destroying the plant but believing that his fame is the only thing that is earning him Audrey's love, he is unable to do so (\"The Meek Shall Inherit\").\n\nAs Seymour works on his speech for a lecture tour, Audrey II again squalls for blood.  Seymour threatens to kill it just as Audrey walks in asking when Mushnik will return from visiting his \"sick sister\". Seymour learns that Audrey would still love him without the fame and decides that Audrey II must die after the scheduled [[LIFE magazine|''LIFE'' magazine]] interview at the shop. Audrey is confused and frightened by Seymour's ramblings, but she runs home by his order.  That night, unable to sleep and distressed by Seymour's strange behavior, Audrey goes to the flower shop to talk with him.  He is not there, and Audrey II begs her to water him. Not sensing the mortal danger, she approaches to water it, and a vine wraps around her and pulls her into the plant's gaping maw (\"[[Sominex]]/Suppertime II\"). Seymour arrives and attacks the plant in an attempt to save Audrey. He pulls her out, but Audrey is mortally wounded.  Her dying wish is for Seymour to feed her to the plant after she dies so that they can always be together. She dies in his arms, and he reluctantly honors her request (\"Somewhere That's Green\" (reprise)). Seymour falls asleep as Audrey II grows small red flower buds.\n\nThe next day, Patrick Martin from the World Botanical Enterprises tells Seymour that his company wishes to take leaf [[Cutting (plant)|cuttings]] of Audrey II and sell them across America. Seymour realizes the plant's evil plan: during the [[solar eclipse]], Audrey II came from an unknown planet to conquer Earth. He tries shooting, cutting, and poisoning the plant, but it has grown too hardy to kill.  Seymour, in desperation, runs into its open jaws with a [[machete]] planning to kill it from the inside, but he is quickly eaten. Patrick, Crystal, Ronette, and Chiffon search for Seymour.

The setting is moved from [[Skid Row, Los Angeles]] to Skid Row in New York. Seymour's [[hypochondriac]]al [[Jewish mother stereotype|Jewish mother]] is omitted in the musical, and Seymour becomes an orphan in the care of Mushnik. Also dropped is the subplot involving the two investigating police officers.  The characters of Mrs. Siddie Shiva and Burson Fouch are also omitted, although Mrs. Shiva is mentioned as being the shop's biggest funeral account. The gleefully [[Sadomasochism|masochistic]] dental patient, originally played by [[Jack Nicholson]], is not in the musical but is in the 1986 film, played by [[Bill Murray]].<!-- MURRAY PLAYED THE MASOCHIST.  STEVE MARTIN WAS THE DENTIST.  PLEASE DO NOT CHANGE THIS! -->\n\nIn the musical, the sadistic dentist, Orin Scrivello, is killed by suffocation from [[laughing gas]] instead of being stabbed with a dental instrument as in the film.  His abusive relationship with Audrey is added to the musical to give Seymour a motive to kill him.  In the film, Seymour murders several innocent bystanders, and Mushnik tricks a thief into looking for money inside the plant, which eats the thief.  In the musical, Seymour tricks Mushnik in the same way when Mushnik plans to turn Seymour over to the police.  The two neighborhood girls in the film are replaced in the musical by a chorus of three street urchins: [[The Crystals|Crystal]], [[The Chiffons|Chiffon]] and [[The Ronettes|Ronette]], named after (and reminiscent of) [[girl group]]s of the 1960s.  The plant is named \"Audrey II\" in the musical, rather than the film's \"Audrey Junior\", and instead of being a crossbreed of a [[butterwort]] and a [[Venus Flytrap]], in the musical it is a creature from [[outer space]] intent on taking over the world.\n\nPerhaps the biggest difference is the ending.  The musical ends with Orin, Mushnik, Audrey and Seymour all eaten by the plant, and the three girls report that Audrey II's progeny continues to consume people.  In the 1960 film, Mushnik and Audrey survive,  and the plant's carnivorous activities are discovered when its flowers bloom with the faces of its victims, including Seymour, imprinted on them.  The musical references this ending in its finale, in which the Plant's four victims' faces are seen in its blooming flowers. \n\nThe change in ending of the musical contributes to its portrayal of class struggles and moral values. While the 1986 film shows Seymour and Audrey escaping to the dream suburban house, encapsulating ideals of the 1950s [[American Dream]], the musical hints to a metaphorical portrayal of Seymour's greed as the plant.<ref>Jensen, Marc. \"Feed me!: Power struggles and the portrayal of race in ''Little Shop of Horrors''\", ''Cinema Journal'' 48, no. 1 (2008): 51\u201367</ref> Seymour's greed gradually consumes himself and Audrey. The musical engages with ideas relating to human values in the face of capitalist culture, disempowering those who are enveloped with motivations of personal monetary gain and overlook moral values. It serves as a social commentary of commodity fetishism.<ref>Leigh, Mary K., and Kevin K. Durand, eds. Marxism and the Movies: Critical Essays on Class Struggle in the Cinema.

It has a huge, nasty-looking pod that gains a shark-like aspect when open and snapping at food. The creature is played by a series of increasing[ly] large puppets\".<ref name=MTI>{{Cite web |url=http://www.mtishows.com/show_detail.asp?showid=000188|title=\"Little Shop of Horrors\", Casting \u2013 Character Breakdown|accessdate=25 December 2008|author=Music Theatre International}}</ref>\n\nIn productions, the first puppet is a small potted plant \"less than one foot tall\" held by the actor portraying Seymour.<ref name=MTI/>  He manipulates the plant himself with his hand and then sets it down, where it is moved by an unseen hand from beneath a shelf.  The second puppet is slightly larger than the first and is operated by Seymour during the song \"You Never Know\".  A fake arm in a sleeve matching Seymour's jacket is attached to the plant's pot, while the actor's real arm operates the plant.  The third puppet sits on the floor and is large enough to hide a person inside, who moves the plant's mouth in sync with Audrey II's voice, which is supplied by an offstage actor on a microphone.  The puppeteer's legs are clad in green tights with \"leaf\" shoes that serve as part of the plant's tendrils.  In Act II, the largest puppet again hides an actor inside, who manipulates the puppet's mouth and often some of its branches.  By this point, the head is at least six feet long and capable of \"swallowing\" characters.  For the finale, additions can be made to make the plant appear taller and even bigger.<ref name=MTI/> Actors and stage hands are often used to move larger branches and roots, which, in the original off-Broadway production, spilled off the stage and into the audience. In some productions, dangling vines over the house enhance the effect of Audrey II menacing the audience.\n\nAmateur productions of ''Little Shop of Horrors'' receive designs for building the puppets from [[Music Theatre International|MTI]], as part of the rental scripts and scores, based on the original Martin P. Robinson designs.  Some companies who have produced the show in the past and built their own puppets rent them out to other companies to recoup some of their construction costs.<ref>See, for example, [http://www.prattsburgh.wnyric.org/audrey_ii_rental.htm \"Prattsburgh Central School, Audrey II Rental\"]</ref>\n\n==Adaptations==\n\n===1986 feature film===\n{{main|Little Shop of Horrors (film)}}\nA [[Little Shop of Horrors (film)|film version]] of the musical was made in 1986.  Directed by [[Frank Oz]] and noted as the only film written by [[Howard Ashman]], it starred [[Rick Moranis]] as Seymour, [[Ellen Greene]] as Audrey, [[Vincent Gardenia]] as Mr. Mushnik, [[Steve Martin]] as Orin Scrivello, DDS, and the voice of [[Levi Stubbs]] as Audrey II. [[Bill Murray]] played the small comic role of the masochist, Arthur Denton.  The 1986 film follows the plot of the musical closely but omits the songs \"Ya Never Know\" (rewritten as \"Some Fun Now,\" a trio for Crystal, Ronette and Chiffon), \"Mushnik and Son\", \"Now (It's Just the Gas)\", \"Sudden Changes,\" \"Closed for Renovation\" and \"Call Back in the Morning\"; the [[Final cut (film editing)|final cut]] ending also omits \"Finale Ultimo (Don't Feed The Plants)\".  Other changes include the removal of Mr. Mushnik's adoption proposition and a new ending, in which Seymour is able to save Audrey from Audrey II and then electrocutes the plant after it has destroyed the shop. Seymour and Audrey marry and move to the tract home of her dreams, but a small Audrey II-type bud is seen in their garden, which portends a possible spread of the alien plants.  An ending more faithful to the stage version was filmed, in which the plant eats Audrey and Seymour and then, having grown to massive size and reproduced, goes on a [[King Kong]]-style rampage through New York City.  It was received poorly by test audiences, and the upbeat alternate ending was used for the theatrical cut. In October 2012, the original ending was restored and released with the film as \"The Director's Cut\" on DVD and Blu-ray. A new song for Audrey II, \"Mean Green Mother from Outer Space\", was nominated for an [[Academy Award]] for Best Original Song.\n\n===Planned feature film===\nA remake of the musical for feature film is planned by [[Warner Bros. Pictures]], with [[Greg Berlanti]] directing. [[Billy Porter (entertainer)|Billy Porter]] has been cast as the voice of Audrey II.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/chris-evans-talks-star-little-shop-horrors-1280781 | title = Chris Evans in Talks to Star in Greg Berlanti's 'Little Shop of Horrors' | first = Borys | last = Kit | date = February 24, 2020 | accessdate = February 24, 2020 | work = [[The Hollywood Reporter]] }}</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n*Ganzl, Kurt.

The story follows a hapless florist shop worker who raises a plant that feeds on human blood and flesh.  The musical is based on the low-budget 1960 [[black comedy]] film ''[[The Little Shop of Horrors]]''.  The music, composed by Menken in the style of early 1960s [[rock and roll]], [[doo-wop]] and early [[Motown Records|Motown]], includes several well-known tunes, including the title song, \"Skid Row (Downtown)\", \"Somewhere That's Green\", and \"Suddenly, Seymour\".\n\nThe musical premiered [[Off-Off-Broadway]] in 1982 before moving to the [[Orpheum Theatre (Manhattan)|Orpheum Theatre]] [[Off-Broadway]], where it had a five-year run.  It later received numerous productions in the U.S. and abroad, and a subsequent [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] production. Because of its small cast, it has become popular with [[community theatre]], school and other amateur groups.<ref>''[[Time (magazine)|TIME magazine]]'' reported in its May 26, 2008 issue, p. 51, that this musical ranked as the most frequently produced musical by U.S. high schools in 2007.</ref>  The musical was also made into a 1986 [[Little Shop of Horrors (film)|film of the same name]], directed by [[Frank Oz]].\n\n==Synopsis==\n\n===Act I===\nAn offstage voice recalls a time when the human race \"suddenly encountered a deadly threat to its very existence\". A trio of 1960s street urchins named Crystal, Ronette, and Chiffon set the scene (\"Little Shop of Horrors\") and comment on the action throughout the show. Seymour Krelborn is a poor young man, an orphan living in an urban [[skid row]]. Audrey is a pretty blonde with a fashion sense that leans towards the tacky. They lament their stations in life and the urban blight in their neighborhood (\"Skid Row (Downtown)\"). They are co-workers at Mushnik's Skid Row Florists, a run-down flower shop owned and operated by the cranky Mr. Mushnik. Seymour has recently obtained a mysterious plant that looks like a large [[venus flytrap]]. While he was browsing the wholesale flower district, a sudden eclipse of the sun occurred, and when the light returned, the weird plant had appeared (\"Da-Doo\"). Seymour, who is secretly in love with Audrey, names the plant Audrey II in her honor.\n\nThe plant does not thrive in its new environment and appears to be dying. Seymour questions why it should be doing poorly, since he takes such good care of it. He accidentally pricks his finger on a rose thorn, which draws blood, and Audrey II's pod opens thirstily. Seymour realizes that Audrey II requires blood to survive and allows the plant to suckle from his finger (\"Grow For Me\"). As Audrey II grows, it becomes an attraction and starts generating brisk business for Mushnik. As the caretaker of the plant, the timid Seymour is suddenly regarded as a hero (\"Ya Never Know\"), while Audrey secretly longs to leave her abusive boyfriend. Her dream is to lead an ideal suburban life with Seymour, complete with a tract home, frozen dinners, and plastic on the furniture (\"Somewhere That's Green\").\n\nMeanwhile, the employees at Mushnik's are sprucing up the flower shop because of the popularity of the rapidly growing Audrey II and the revenue that it is bringing in (\"Closed for Renovation\"). Orin Scrivello, a [[Sadistic personality disorder|sadistic]] [[Dentistry|dentist]], is Audrey's abusive boyfriend. Modeled after the \"Leader of the pack\" characters of the 1950s, Orin drives a motorcycle, wears leather, and enjoys bringing other people pain (\"Dentist!\"). Orin encourages Seymour to take the plant and get out of Skid Row. Realizing that his store's sudden profitability is completely dependent on the plant (and therefore on Seymour), Mushnik takes advantage of Seymour's innocence by offering to adopt him and make him a full partner in the business. Having always wanted a family, Seymour accepts, even though Mushnik has always yelled at him and treated him poorly (\"Mushnik and Son\"). However, Seymour is having difficulty providing enough blood to keep Audrey II healthy. When Seymour stops feeding the plant, Audrey II reveals that it can speak. It demands blood and promises that, if fed, it will make sure that all of Seymour's dreams come true. Seymour initially refuses, but he then witnesses Orin abusing Audrey. The plant presents this as a justification for killing Orin. Not realizing that he is being manipulated again, Seymour gives in to his baser instincts and agrees (\"Feed Me (Git It)\"). \n\nHe sets up a late-night appointment with Orin, intending to kill him. However, Seymour loses his nerve and decides not to commit the crime. Unfortunately for Orin, who is getting high on [[nitrous oxide]], the gas device is stuck in the \"on\" position, and he suffocates while asking Seymour to save him. Seymour cannot bring himself to shoot Orin but lets him die of asphyxiation (\"Now (It's Just The Gas)\"). Seymour feeds Orin's body to the now huge Audrey II, and the plant consumes it with ravenous glee (\"Act I Finale\").\n\n===Act II===\n{{Listen\n|filename=Suddenly, Seymour - 2003 revival.ogg\n|title=\"Suddenly, Seymour\"\n|description=The beginning of the last chorus of \"Suddenly, Seymour\", performed by Kerry Butler and Hunter Foster on the 2003 Broadway revival cast recording.}}\n\nThe flower shop is much busier, and Seymour and Audrey have trouble keeping up with the onslaught of orders (\"Call Back in the Morning\"). Audrey confides to Seymour that she feels guilty about Orin's disappearance, because she secretly wished it. The two admit their feelings for one another, and Seymour promises that he will protect and care for Audrey from now on (\"Suddenly, Seymour\"). The two plan to leave together and start a new life, although Seymour mistakenly attributes Audrey's feelings to his newfound fame, not realizing that she loved him even before he found the plant.\n\nBefore they can go, Mushnik confronts Seymour about Orin's death. Mushnik has put two and two together: the bloody dentist's uniform, the drops of blood on the floor, and he has seen Seymour and Audrey kissing. Seymour denies killing Orin, but Mushnik wants him to give a statement to the police, who have begun investigating. Audrey II tells Seymour that he has to be rid of Mushnik or he will lose everything, including Audrey (\"Suppertime\"). Seymour tells Mushnik that he put the days' receipts inside Audrey II for safekeeping. Mushnik climbs inside the plant's gaping maw to search for the money, realizing the deception too late, and screams as he is devoured. Seymour now runs the flower shop, and reporters, salesmen, lawyers and agents approach him, promising him fame and fortune. Although tempted by the trappings of his success, Seymour realizes that it is only a matter of time before Audrey II will kill again and that he is morally responsible. He considers destroying the plant but believing that his fame is the only thing that is earning him Audrey's love, he is unable to do so (\"The Meek Shall Inherit\").\n\nAs Seymour works on his speech for a lecture tour, Audrey II again squalls for blood.  Seymour threatens to kill it just as Audrey walks in asking when Mushnik will return from visiting his \"sick sister\". Seymour learns that Audrey would still love him without the fame and decides that Audrey II must die after the scheduled [[LIFE magazine|''LIFE'' magazine]] interview at the shop. Audrey is confused and frightened by Seymour's ramblings, but she runs home by his order.  That night, unable to sleep and distressed by Seymour's strange behavior, Audrey goes to the flower shop to talk with him.  He is not there, and Audrey II begs her to water him. Not sensing the mortal danger, she approaches to water it, and a vine wraps around her and pulls her into the plant's gaping maw (\"[[Sominex]]/Suppertime II\"). Seymour arrives and attacks the plant in an attempt to save Audrey. He pulls her out, but Audrey is mortally wounded.  Her dying wish is for Seymour to feed her to the plant after she dies so that they can always be together. She dies in his arms, and he reluctantly honors her request (\"Somewhere That's Green\" (reprise)). Seymour falls asleep as Audrey II grows small red flower buds.\n\nThe next day, Patrick Martin from the World Botanical Enterprises tells Seymour that his company wishes to take leaf [[Cutting (plant)|cuttings]] of Audrey II and sell them across America. Seymour realizes the plant's evil plan: during the [[solar eclipse]], Audrey II came from an unknown planet to conquer Earth. He tries shooting, cutting, and poisoning the plant, but it has grown too hardy to kill.  Seymour, in desperation, runs into its open jaws with a [[machete]] planning to kill it from the inside, but he is quickly eaten. Patrick, Crystal, Ronette, and Chiffon search for Seymour. Not finding him, Patrick tells the girls to take the cuttings.\n\nCrystal, Ronette, and Chiffon relate that, following these events, other plants appeared across America, tricking innocent people into feeding them blood in exchange for fame and fortune. Out of the fog, Audrey II, bigger than ever, appears with opened new flowers revealing the faces of Seymour, Audrey, Mushnik and Orin, who beg that, no matter how persuasive the plants may be, they must not be fed (\"Finale Ultimo: Don't Feed the Plants\"). Audrey II slithers towards the audience threateningly (In the original Off-Broadway production, plant tendrils fell all over the audience, as if each audience member were to be pulled into the plant, while in the Broadway production, a monstrously huge Audrey II was projected out over the fifth row and the balcony seats, as if it would eat the audience members).\n\n==Original production==\n===Off-Broadway===\nThe [[musical theater|musical]] had its world premiere [[Off-Off-Broadway]] on May 6, 1982 at the Workshop of the Players Art Foundation (WPA\u00a0Theatre), playing there until June 6, 1982.<ref>[http://howardashman.com/theatre.html \"Theater: ''Little Shop of Horrors''\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150209054052/http://howardashman.com/theatre.html |date=2015-02-09 }}, Howard Ashman website, accessed April 21, 2014</ref>  It opened [[Off-Broadway]] at the [[Orpheum Theatre (Manhattan)|Orpheum Theatre]] in Manhattan's [[East Village, Manhattan|East Village]] on July 27, 1982.

The setting is moved from [[Skid Row, Los Angeles]] to Skid Row in New York. Seymour's [[hypochondriac]]al [[Jewish mother stereotype|Jewish mother]] is omitted in the musical, and Seymour becomes an orphan in the care of Mushnik. Also dropped is the subplot involving the two investigating police officers.  The characters of Mrs. Siddie Shiva and Burson Fouch are also omitted, although Mrs. Shiva is mentioned as being the shop's biggest funeral account. The gleefully [[Sadomasochism|masochistic]] dental patient, originally played by [[Jack Nicholson]], is not in the musical but is in the 1986 film, played by [[Bill Murray]].<!-- MURRAY PLAYED THE MASOCHIST.  STEVE MARTIN WAS THE DENTIST.  PLEASE DO NOT CHANGE THIS! -->\n\nIn the musical, the sadistic dentist, Orin Scrivello, is killed by suffocation from [[laughing gas]] instead of being stabbed with a dental instrument as in the film.  His abusive relationship with Audrey is added to the musical to give Seymour a motive to kill him.  In the film, Seymour murders several innocent bystanders, and Mushnik tricks a thief into looking for money inside the plant, which eats the thief.  In the musical, Seymour tricks Mushnik in the same way when Mushnik plans to turn Seymour over to the police.  The two neighborhood girls in the film are replaced in the musical by a chorus of three street urchins: [[The Crystals|Crystal]], [[The Chiffons|Chiffon]] and [[The Ronettes|Ronette]], named after (and reminiscent of) [[girl group]]s of the 1960s.  The plant is named \"Audrey II\" in the musical, rather than the film's \"Audrey Junior\", and instead of being a crossbreed of a [[butterwort]] and a [[Venus Flytrap]], in the musical it is a creature from [[outer space]] intent on taking over the world.\n\nPerhaps the biggest difference is the ending.  The musical ends with Orin, Mushnik, Audrey and Seymour all eaten by the plant, and the three girls report that Audrey II's progeny continues to consume people.  In the 1960 film, Mushnik and Audrey survive,  and the plant's carnivorous activities are discovered when its flowers bloom with the faces of its victims, including Seymour, imprinted on them.  The musical references this ending in its finale, in which the Plant's four victims' faces are seen in its blooming flowers. \n\nThe change in ending of the musical contributes to its portrayal of class struggles and moral values. While the 1986 film shows Seymour and Audrey escaping to the dream suburban house, encapsulating ideals of the 1950s [[American Dream]], the musical hints to a metaphorical portrayal of Seymour's greed as the plant.<ref>Jensen, Marc. \"Feed me!: Power struggles and the portrayal of race in ''Little Shop of Horrors''\", ''Cinema Journal'' 48, no. 1 (2008): 51\u201367</ref> Seymour's greed gradually consumes himself and Audrey. The musical engages with ideas relating to human values in the face of capitalist culture, disempowering those who are enveloped with motivations of personal monetary gain and overlook moral values. It serves as a social commentary of commodity fetishism.<ref>Leigh, Mary K., and Kevin K. Durand, eds. Marxism and the Movies: Critical Essays on Class Struggle in the Cinema.

A pre-Broadway production debuted at the Miracle Theatre in [[Coral Gables, Florida]] on May 16, 2003. Lee Wilkof, who originated the role of Seymour in 1982, was cast as Mr. Mushnik. The production was directed by Wilkof's wife, Connie Grappo, who was the assistant to [[Howard Ashman]] during the original production.<ref name=NYTimes1020/> Muppeteer [[Martin P.

The creature is played by a series of increasing[ly] large puppets\".<ref name=MTI>{{Cite web |url=http://www.mtishows.com/show_detail.asp?showid=000188|title=\"Little Shop of Horrors\", Casting \u2013 Character Breakdown|accessdate=25 December 2008|author=Music Theatre International}}</ref>\n\nIn productions, the first puppet is a small potted plant \"less than one foot tall\" held by the actor portraying Seymour.<ref name=MTI/>  He manipulates the plant himself with his hand and then sets it down, where it is moved by an unseen hand from beneath a shelf.  The second puppet is slightly larger than the first and is operated by Seymour during the song \"You Never Know\".  A fake arm in a sleeve matching Seymour's jacket is attached to the plant's pot, while the actor's real arm operates the plant.  The third puppet sits on the floor and is large enough to hide a person inside, who moves the plant's mouth in sync with Audrey II's voice, which is supplied by an offstage actor on a microphone.  The puppeteer's legs are clad in green tights with \"leaf\" shoes that serve as part of the plant's tendrils.  In Act II, the largest puppet again hides an actor inside, who manipulates the puppet's mouth and often some of its branches.  By this point, the head is at least six feet long and capable of \"swallowing\" characters.  For the finale, additions can be made to make the plant appear taller and even bigger.<ref name=MTI/> Actors and stage hands are often used to move larger branches and roots, which, in the original off-Broadway production, spilled off the stage and into the audience. In some productions, dangling vines over the house enhance the effect of Audrey II menacing the audience.\n\nAmateur productions of ''Little Shop of Horrors'' receive designs for building the puppets from [[Music Theatre International|MTI]], as part of the rental scripts and scores, based on the original Martin P. Robinson designs.  Some companies who have produced the show in the past and built their own puppets rent them out to other companies to recoup some of their construction costs.<ref>See, for example, [http://www.prattsburgh.wnyric.org/audrey_ii_rental.htm \"Prattsburgh Central School, Audrey II Rental\"]</ref>\n\n==Adaptations==\n\n===1986 feature film===\n{{main|Little Shop of Horrors (film)}}\nA [[Little Shop of Horrors (film)|film version]] of the musical was made in 1986.  Directed by [[Frank Oz]] and noted as the only film written by [[Howard Ashman]], it starred [[Rick Moranis]] as Seymour, [[Ellen Greene]] as Audrey, [[Vincent Gardenia]] as Mr. Mushnik, [[Steve Martin]] as Orin Scrivello, DDS, and the voice of [[Levi Stubbs]] as Audrey II. [[Bill Murray]] played the small comic role of the masochist, Arthur Denton.  The 1986 film follows the plot of the musical closely but omits the songs \"Ya Never Know\" (rewritten as \"Some Fun Now,\" a trio for Crystal, Ronette and Chiffon), \"Mushnik and Son\", \"Now (It's Just the Gas)\", \"Sudden Changes,\" \"Closed for Renovation\" and \"Call Back in the Morning\"; the [[Final cut (film editing)|final cut]] ending also omits \"Finale Ultimo (Don't Feed The Plants)\".  Other changes include the removal of Mr. Mushnik's adoption proposition and a new ending, in which Seymour is able to save Audrey from Audrey II and then electrocutes the plant after it has destroyed the shop. Seymour and Audrey marry and move to the tract home of her dreams, but a small Audrey II-type bud is seen in their garden, which portends a possible spread of the alien plants.  An ending more faithful to the stage version was filmed, in which the plant eats Audrey and Seymour and then, having grown to massive size and reproduced, goes on a [[King Kong]]-style rampage through New York City.  It was received poorly by test audiences, and the upbeat alternate ending was used for the theatrical cut. In October 2012, the original ending was restored and released with the film as \"The Director's Cut\" on DVD and Blu-ray. A new song for Audrey II, \"Mean Green Mother from Outer Space\", was nominated for an [[Academy Award]] for Best Original Song.\n\n===Planned feature film===\nA remake of the musical for feature film is planned by [[Warner Bros. Pictures]], with [[Greg Berlanti]] directing. [[Billy Porter (entertainer)|Billy Porter]] has been cast as the voice of Audrey II.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/chris-evans-talks-star-little-shop-horrors-1280781 | title = Chris Evans in Talks to Star in Greg Berlanti's 'Little Shop of Horrors' | first = Borys | last = Kit | date = February 24, 2020 | accessdate = February 24, 2020 | work = [[The Hollywood Reporter]] }}</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n*Ganzl, Kurt.
