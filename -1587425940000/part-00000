took place on the [[Gallipoli]] peninsula ([[Gelibolu]] in modern Turkey), from 17 February 1915 to 9 January 1916. The [[Allies of World War I|Entente]] powers, [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]], [[French Third Republic|France]] and [[Russian Empire|Russia]], sought to weaken the [[Ottoman Empire]], one of the [[Central Powers]], by taking control of the straits that provided a supply route to Russia. The [[Allies of World War I|Allies']] attack on Ottoman forts at the entrance of the [[Dardanelles]] in February 1915 failed and was followed by an [[Amphibious warfare#World War I era|amphibious landing]] on the [[Gallipoli]] peninsula in April 1915 to capture the Ottoman capital of Constantinople ([[Istanbul]]).{{sfn|Aspinall-Oglander|1929|pp=51\u201352}}\n\nIn January 1916, after eight months' fighting, with approximately 250,000 casualties on each side, the land campaign was abandoned and the invasion force withdrawn. It was a costly defeat for the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]] and for the sponsors, especially [[First Lord of the Admiralty]] (1911\u20131915), [[Winston Churchill]]. The campaign was considered a great [[List of Ottoman conquests, sieges and landings|Ottoman victory]]. In Turkey, it is regarded as a defining moment in the history of the state, a final surge in the defence of the motherland as the Ottoman Empire retreated. The struggle formed the basis for the [[Turkish War of Independence]] and the declaration of the [[Republic of Turkey]] eight years later, with  [[Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk]], who rose to prominence as a commander at [[Gallipoli]], as [[List of national founders#Turkey|founder]] and president.\n\nThe campaign is often considered to be the beginning of Australian and New Zealand [[national consciousness]]; 25 April, the anniversary of the landings, is known as [[ANZAC Day]], the most significant commemoration of military casualties and veterans in the two countries, surpassing [[Remembrance Day]] ([[Armistice Day]]).{{sfn|Dennis et al.|2008|pp=32, 38}}{{sfn|Lewis|Balderstone|Bowan|2006|p=110}}{{sfn|McGibbon|2000|p=198}}\n\n== Background ==\n{{Main|Middle Eastern theatre of World War I|Ottoman entry into World War I}}\n\nOn 27 October 1914, two former German warships, the Ottoman {{ship|Ottoman battlecruiser|Yav\u00fbz Sult\u00e2n Sel\u00eem||2}} and {{ship|Ottoman cruiser|Midilli||2}}, still under the command of German officers, conducted the [[Black Sea Raid]], in which they bombarded the Russian port of [[Odessa]] and sank several ships.{{sfn|Fewster|Basarin|Basarin|2003|p=44}} On 31 October, the Ottomans entered the war and began the [[Caucasus campaign]] against Russia.

Kitchener was working on the plan as late as March 1915 and was the beginning of the British attempt to incite an [[Arab Revolt]]. The Alexandretta landing was abandoned because militarily it would have required more resources than France could allocate and politically France did not want the British operating in their sphere of influence, a position to which Britain had agreed in 1912.{{sfn|Tauber|1993|pp=22\u201325}}\n\nBy late 1914, on the [[Western Front (World War I)|pee Front]], the Franco-British counter-offensive of the [[First Battle of the Marne]] had ended and the Belgians, British and French had suffered many casualties in the [[First Battle of Ypres]] in Flanders.

All agreed that the best defence was to hold the high ground on the ridges of the peninsula. There was disagreement as to where the enemy would land and hence where to concentrate forces. [[Lieutenant Colonel]] [[Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk|Mustafa Kemal]] was familiar with the Gallipoli peninsula from his operations against Bulgaria in the Balkan Wars and forecast that Cape Helles (the southern tip of the peninsula) and [[Kabatepe|Gaba Tepe]] were the likely areas for landing.{{sfn|Carlyon|2001|p=31}}{{sfn|Butler|2011|p=121}}\n\nMustafa Kemal believed that the British would use their naval power to command the land from every side at the tip of the peninsula; at Gaba Tepe, the short distance to the eastern coast meant that the Allies could easily reach the Narrows (the right-angled bend in the middle of the Dardanelles).{{sfn|Kinross|1995|pp=73\u201374}}{{sfn|Bean|1941a|p=179}} Sanders considered [[Be\u015fik Bay, \u00c7anakkale|Besika Bay]] on the Asiatic coast to be the most vulnerable to invasion, since the terrain was easier to cross and was convenient to attack the most important Ottoman batteries guarding the straits and a third of the 5th Army was assembled there.{{sfn|James|1995|p=74}} Two divisions were concentrated at [[Bolay\u0131r|Bulair]] at the north end of the Gallipoli peninsula, to protect supply and communication lines to the defences further down the peninsula.{{sfn|James|1995|p=75}} The [[19th Infantry Division (Ottoman Empire)|19th Division]] (Kemal) and the 9th Division were placed along the Aegean coast and at Cape Helles on the tip of the peninsula.

A maximum effort to improve land and sea communications was ordered, to move reinforcements swiftly to danger points; troops moved at night to avoid Allied air reconnaissance. Sanders' strategy was opposed by Ottoman commanders, including Kemal, who believed that the defenders were too widely dispersed to defeat the invasion on the beaches.{{sfn|James|1995|p=76}} Sanders was certain that a rigid system of defence would fail and that the only hope of success lay in the mobility of the three groups, particularly the 19th Division near Boghali, in general reserve, ready to move to Bulair, Gaba Tepe or the Asiatic shore.{{sfn|Aspinall-Oglander|1929|pp=154\u201357}}\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-R36225, T\u00fcrkei, Dardanellen, Schweres Gesch\u00fctz.jpg|thumb|upright=1.0|Heavy artillery from the German inland gun emplacement 1915]]\nThe time needed by the British to organise the landings meant that Sanders, Colonel [[Hans Kannengiesser]] and other German officers, supported by [[Mehmet Esat B\u00fclkat|Esat Pasha]] ([[III Corps (Ottoman Empire)|III Corps]]) had more time to prepare their defences.{{sfn|Broadbent|2005|p=40}} Sanders later noted, \"the British allowed us four good weeks of respite for all this work before their great disembarkation&nbsp;...

A further six Victoria Crosses were awarded among the infantry and sailors at the 'V' Beach landing and three more were awarded the following day as they fought their way inland.

While it diverted Ottoman forces away from other areas of conflict in the Middle East, the campaign also consumed resources the Allies could have employed on the Western Front,{{sfn|Doyle|Bennett|1999|p=15}} and also resulted in heavy losses on the Allied side.{{sfn|Haythornthwaite|2004|p=90}}\n\nThe Allied campaign was plagued by ill-defined goals, poor planning, insufficient artillery, inexperienced troops, inaccurate maps, poor intelligence, overconfidence, inadequate equipment, and logistical and tactical deficiencies at all levels.{{sfn|Hart|2007|pp=11\u201312}}{{sfn|Broadbent|2005|p=268}} Geography also proved a significant factor. While the Allied forces possessed inaccurate maps and intelligence and proved unable to exploit the terrain to their advantage, the Ottoman commanders were able to utilise the high ground around the Allied landing beaches to position well-sited defences that limited the ability of Allied forces to penetrate inland, confining them to narrow beaches.{{sfn|Doyle|Bennett|1999|p=12}} The campaign's necessity remains the subject of debate,{{sfn|Stevenson|2007|p=189}} and the recriminations that followed were significant, highlighting the schism that had developed between military strategists who felt the Allies should focus on fighting on the Western Front and those who favoured trying to end the war by attacking Germany's \"soft underbelly\", its allies in the east.{{sfn|Hart|2007|p=10}}\n\nBritish and French submarine operations in the Sea of Marmara were the one significant area of success of the Gallipoli campaign, forcing the Ottomans to abandon the sea as a transport route. Between April and December 1915, nine British and four French submarines carried out 15 patrols, sinking one battleship, one destroyer, five [[gunboat]]s, 11 [[troop transport]]s, 44 supply ships and 148 sailing vessels at a cost of eight Allied submarines sunk in the strait or in the Sea of Marmara.{{sfn|O'Connell|2010|pp=76\u201378}} During the campaign there was always one British submarine in the Sea of Marmara, sometimes two; in October 1915, there were four Allied submarines in the region.{{sfn|O'Connell|2010|p=73}} ''E2'' left the Sea of Marmara on 2 January 1916, the last British submarine in the region. Four E-class and five B-class submarines remained in the Mediterranean Sea following the evacuation of Helles.{{sfn|O'Connell|2010|p=78}} By this time the Ottoman navy had been all but forced to cease operations in the area, while merchant shipping had also been significantly curtailed. The official German naval historian, Admiral Eberhard von Mantey, later concluded that had the sea-lanes of communication been completely severed the Ottoman 5th Army would likely have faced catastrophe. As it was these operations were a source of significant anxiety, posing a constant threat to shipping and causing heavy losses, effectively dislocating Ottoman attempts to reinforce their forces at Gallipoli and shelling troop concentrations and railways.{{sfn|Brenchley|Brenchley|2001|pp=113\u201314}}\n\nGallipoli marked the end for Hamilton and Stopford, but Hunter-Weston went on to lead VIII Corps on the first day of the [[Battle of the Somme]].{{sfn|Broadbent|2005|pp=233, 270}}{{sfn|Neillands|2004|p= 259}} The competence of Australian brigade commanders, John Monash (4th Infantry Brigade) and [[Harry Chauvel]] ([[1st Light Horse Brigade]], New Zealand and Australian Division), was recognised by promotion to divisional and corps command.{{sfn|Grey|2008|pp=100, 107}}{{sfn|Haythornthwaite|2004|p=14}} The influence of Kitchener waned after the coalition government was formed in May 1915, partly because of the growing sense of failure in the Dardanelles and culminated in Kitchener being over-ruled on support for the French at Salonika in early December 1915, when his influence on the Cabinet was at its lowest.{{sfn|Cassar|2004|pp=202\u201303, 259, 263}} The campaign gave confidence to the Ottomans in their ability to defeat the Allies.{{sfn|Broadbent|2005|p=268}} In [[Mesopotamia]], the Turks surrounded a British expedition at [[Siege of Kut|Kut Al Amara]], forcing their surrender in April 1916.{{sfn|Baldwin|1962|p=94}} Ottoman forces in southern Palestine were poised to launch an attack against the Suez Canal and Egypt.{{sfn|Pick|1990|pp=181, 209}} Defeat at the [[Battle of Romani]], however, and lack of the materials to complete the military railway necessary for such an operation, marked the end of that ambition.{{sfn|Pick|1990|p=210}} The optimism gained from the victory at Gallipoli was replaced by a gathering sense of despair, and the British remained on the offensive in the Middle East for the rest of the war.{{sfn|Erickson|2001a|p=127}}{{sfn|Grey|2008|p=117}}\n\n[[File:Gallipoli ANZAC Cove Sphinx 2.JPG|thumb|upright=1.0|left|The Sphinx, one of the battlefield's most distinctive physical landmarks]]\n\nThe lessons of the campaign were studied by military planners prior to amphibious operations such as the [[Normandy Landings]] in 1944 and during the [[Falklands War]] in 1982.{{sfn|Wahlert|2008|p=29}}{{sfn|Holmes|2001|p=343}} The lessons of the campaign influenced US Marine Corps amphibious operations during the [[Pacific War]] and continue to influence US amphibious doctrine.{{sfn|Wahlert|2008|p=29}}{{sfn|Gatchel|1996|p=10}} In 1996, Theodore Gatchel wrote that [[interwar period|between the wars]], the campaign \"became a focal point for the study of amphibious warfare\" in Britain and United States.{{sfn|Gatchel|1996|p=10}} In 2008, Glenn Wahlert wrote that Gallipoli involved \"all four types of amphibious operations: the raid, demonstration, assault and withdrawal\".{{sfn|Wahlert|2008|p=29}}\n\n[[Russell Weigley]] wrote that analysis of the campaign before the Second World War led to \"a belief among most of the armed forces of the world\" that amphibious assaults could not succeed against modern defences and that despite landings in [[Allied invasion of Italy|Italy]], [[Battle of Tarawa|Tarawa]] and the [[Gilbert and Marshall Islands campaign|Gilberts]], arguably this perception continued until Normandy in June 1944.{{sfn|Weigley|2005|pp=393\u201396}} Hart wrote that despite the pessimistic analyses after 1918, the situation after 1940 meant that landings from the sea were unavoidable, and it was only after Normandy that the belief that opposed landings were futile was overcome.{{sfn|Hart|2013b|pp=460\u201362}} The memory of Gallipoli weighed heavily upon the Australians during the planning of the [[Huon Peninsula campaign]] in late 1943.

Asquith]] to end his [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] Government and form a Coalition Government with the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]].{{sfn|Cassar|2004|p=180}} The Asquith government responded to the disappointment and outrage over Gallipoli and Kut by establishing commissions of inquiry into both episodes, which had done much to \"destroy its faltering reputation for competence\".{{sfn|Stevenson|2005|pp=121\u201322}} The [[Dardanelles Commission]] was set up to investigate the failure of the expedition, the first report being issued in 1917, with the final report published in 1919.{{sfn|Travers|2001|p=13}} Following the failure of the Dardanelles expedition, Sir Ian Hamilton, commander of the MEF, was recalled to London in October 1915, ending his military career.{{sfn|Broadbent|2005|p=270}} Churchill was demoted from First Lord of the Admiralty as a condition of Conservative entry to the coalition but remained in the Cabinet in the [[sinecure]] of Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster.{{sfn|Holmes|2001|p=203}} Churchill resigned in November 1915 and left London for the Western Front, where he commanded an infantry battalion of the [[Royal Scots Fusiliers]] early in 1916.{{sfn|Holmes|2001|p=203}}{{sfn|Neillands|2004|p=384}}\n\nAsquith was partly blamed for Gallipoli and other disasters and was overthrown in December 1916, when [[David Lloyd George]] proposed a war council under his authority, with the Conservatives in the coalition threatening to resign unless the plan was implemented. After failure to reach agreement, Lloyd George and then Asquith resigned, followed by Lloyd George becoming Prime Minister.{{sfn|Taylor|1965|pp=103\u201306}} Lloyd George formed a new government, from which Churchill, active again in the House of Commons from June 1916, was excluded because of Conservative opposition. In the summer of 1917, Churchill was eventually appointed to the cabinet-level post of [[Minister of Munitions]] but not to the [[War cabinet#First World War|War Cabinet]].{{sfn|Holmes|2001|p=203}} The final report of the Commission was issued in 1919, concluding that with the forces available, success was dependent on the government giving priority to the expedition and leaving the British Expeditionary Force in France to make do. The Commissioners found that Hamilton had been over-optimistic from the beginning and had added to Stopford's difficulties on 8 August 1915. Hamilton emerged from the investigation more favourably than perhaps was justified, partly because he made devious attempts to gain collusion from witnesses and obtain leaks from the  deliberations of the Commission; Hamilton was never given another army appointment.{{sfn|Travers|2001|pp=297\u201398}}{{efn|The enormous casualties at Gallipoli among Irish soldiers who had volunteered to fight in the British Army was a causal factor in the [[Irish War of Independence]]; as balladeers sang, ''\"Twas better to die 'neath an Irish sky than in [[Suvla]] or [[Sedd el Bahr]]\"''.{{sfn|West|2016|p=97}}}}\n\n===Casualties===\n\n{{See also|List of war cemeteries and memorials on the Gallipoli Peninsula}}\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float: right; clear: right; margin:0 0 1em 1em\"\n|+Gallipoli casualties (not including illness){{sfn|Erickson|2001a|p=94}}{{sfn|NZ History|2016|nopp=y}}{{sfn|Aspinall-Oglander|1992|p=484}}{{sfn|Department of Veterans Affairs|p=2}}{{sfn|Lepetit|Tournyol du Clos|Rinieri|1923|p=549}}\n|-\n!Countries\n!Dead\n!Wounded\n!Missing<br />or<br />POW\n!Total\n|-style=\"background:#ccc; text-align:center;\"\n|'''Ottoman<br />Empire'''||'''56,643'''||'''97,007'''||'''11,178'''||'''164,828'''\n|-#B9B9B9\" style=\"background:#; text-align:center;\"\n|-style=\"background:#E8E8E8; text-align:center;\"\n|United Kingdom||34,072||78,520||7,654||120,246\n|-style=\"background:#E8E8E8; text-align:center;\"\n|France||9,798||17,371||\u2014||27,169\n|-style=\"background:#E8E8E8; text-align:center;\"\n|Australia||8,709||19,441||\u2014||28,150\n|-style=\"background:#E8E8E8; text-align:center;\"\n| New Zealand||2,721||4,752||\u2014||7,473\n|-style=\"background:#E8E8E8; text-align:center;\"\n| British India||1,358||3,421||\u2014||4,779\n|-style=\"background:#E8E8E8; text-align:center;\"\n| Newfoundland||49||93||\u2014||142\n|-style=\"background:#E8E8E8; text-align:center;\"\n!Total (Allies)\n!56,707\n!123,598\n!7,654\n!187,959\n|-style=\"background:#CCC; text-align:center;\"\n|}\nCasualty figures for the campaign vary between sources but in 2001, [[Edward J.

took place on the [[Gallipoli]] peninsula ([[Gelibolu]] in modern Turkey), from 17 February 1915 to 9 January 1916. The [[Allies of World War I|Entente]] powers, [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]], [[French Third Republic|France]] and [[Russian Empire|Russia]], sought to weaken the [[Ottoman Empire]], one of the [[Central Powers]], by taking control of the straits that provided a supply route to Russia. The [[Allies of World War I|Allies']] attack on Ottoman forts at the entrance of the [[Dardanelles]] in February 1915 failed and was followed by an [[Amphibious warfare#World War I era|amphibious landing]] on the [[Gallipoli]] peninsula in April 1915 to capture the Ottoman capital of Constantinople ([[Istanbul]]).{{sfn|Aspinall-Oglander|1929|pp=51\u201352}}\n\nIn January 1916, after eight months' fighting, with approximately 250,000 casualties on each side, the land campaign was abandoned and the invasion force withdrawn. It was a costly defeat for the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]] and for the sponsors, especially [[First Lord of the Admiralty]] (1911\u20131915), [[Winston Churchill]]. The campaign was considered a great [[List of Ottoman conquests, sieges and landings|Ottoman victory]]. In Turkey, it is regarded as a defining moment in the history of the state, a final surge in the defence of the motherland as the Ottoman Empire retreated. The struggle formed the basis for the [[Turkish War of Independence]] and the declaration of the [[Republic of Turkey]] eight years later, with  [[Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk]], who rose to prominence as a commander at [[Gallipoli]], as [[List of national founders#Turkey|founder]] and president.\n\nThe campaign is often considered to be the beginning of Australian and New Zealand [[national consciousness]]; 25 April, the anniversary of the landings, is known as [[ANZAC Day]], the most significant commemoration of military casualties and veterans in the two countries, surpassing [[Remembrance Day]] ([[Armistice Day]]).{{sfn|Dennis et al.|2008|pp=32, 38}}{{sfn|Lewis|Balderstone|Bowan|2006|p=110}}{{sfn|McGibbon|2000|p=198}}\n\n== Background ==\n{{Main|Middle Eastern theatre of World War I|Ottoman entry into World War I}}\n\nOn 27 October 1914, two former German warships, the Ottoman {{ship|Ottoman battlecruiser|Yav\u00fbz Sult\u00e2n Sel\u00eem||2}} and {{ship|Ottoman cruiser|Midilli||2}}, still under the command of German officers, conducted the [[Black Sea Raid]], in which they bombarded the Russian port of [[Odessa]] and sank several ships.{{sfn|Fewster|Basarin|Basarin|2003|p=44}} On 31 October, the Ottomans entered the war and began the [[Caucasus campaign]] against Russia.

Kitchener was working on the plan as late as March 1915 and was the beginning of the British attempt to incite an [[Arab Revolt]]. The Alexandretta landing was abandoned because militarily it would have required more resources than France could allocate and politically France did not want the British operating in their sphere of influence, a position to which Britain had agreed in 1912.{{sfn|Tauber|1993|pp=22\u201325}}\n\nBy late 1914, on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]], the Franco-British counter-offensive of the [[First Battle of the Marne]] had ended and the Belgians, British and French had suffered many casualties in the [[First Battle of Ypres]] in Flanders.

All agreed that the best defence was to hold the high ground on the ridges of the peninsula. There was disagreement as to where the enemy would land and hence where to concentrate forces. [[Lieutenant Colonel]] [[Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk|Mustafa Kemal]] was familiar with the Gallipoli peninsula from his operations against Bulgaria in the Balkan Wars and forecast that Cape Helles (the southern tip of the peninsula) and [[Kabatepe|Gaba Tepe]] were the likely areas for landing.{{sfn|Carlyon|2001|p=31}}{{sfn|Butler|2011|p=121}}\n\nMustafa Kemal believed that the British would use their naval power to command the land from every side at the tip of the peninsula; at Gaba Tepe, the short distance to the eastern coast meant that the Allies could easily reach the Narrows (the right-angled bend in the middle of the Dardanelles).{{sfn|Kinross|1995|pp=73\u201374}}{{sfn|Bean|1941a|p=179}} Sanders considered [[Be\u015fik Bay, \u00c7anakkale|Besika Bay]] on the Asiatic coast to be the most vulnerable to invasion, since the terrain was easier to cross and was convenient to attack the most important Ottoman batteries guarding the straits and a third of the 5th Army was assembled there.{{sfn|James|1995|p=74}} Two divisions were concentrated at [[Bolay\u0131r|Bulair]] at the north end of the Gallipoli peninsula, to protect supply and communication lines to the defences further down the peninsula.{{sfn|James|1995|p=75}} The [[19th Infantry Division (Ottoman Empire)|19th Division]] (Kemal) and the 9th Division were placed along the Aegean coast and at Cape Helles on the tip of the peninsula.

A maximum effort to improve land and sea communications was ordered, to move reinforcements swiftly to danger points; troops moved at night to avoid Allied air reconnaissance. Sanders' strategy was opposed by Ottoman commanders, including Kemal, who believed that the defenders were too widely dispersed to defeat the invasion on the beaches.{{sfn|James|1995|p=76}} Sanders was certain that a rigid system of defence would fail and that the only hope of success lay in the mobility of the three groups, particularly the 19th Division near Boghali, in general reserve, ready to move to Bulair, Gaba Tepe or the Asiatic shore.{{sfn|Aspinall-Oglander|1929|pp=154\u201357}}\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-R36225, T\u00fcrkei, Dardanellen, Schweres Gesch\u00fctz.jpg|thumb|upright=1.0|Heavy artillery from the German inland gun emplacement 1915]]\nThe time needed by the British to organise the landings meant that Sanders, Colonel [[Hans Kannengiesser]] and other German officers, supported by [[Mehmet Esat B\u00fclkat|Esat Pasha]] ([[III Corps (Ottoman Empire)|III Corps]]) had more time to prepare their defences.{{sfn|Broadbent|2005|p=40}} Sanders later noted, \"the British allowed us four good weeks of respite for all this work before their great disembarkation&nbsp;...

No decision was ultimately made on the issue of close-support, and it was left up to the initiative of individual ships' captains. A reluctance to approach the shore later impacted on landings at 'V' and 'W' beach where some of the heaviest losses among the infantry occurred, while naval gunfire was of some assistance at 'S', 'X' and ANZAC.{{sfn|Travers|2001|pp=50\u201353}} Even then its effectiveness was limited by the initial confusion ashore, the broken terrain, thick vegetation, and the lack of observation.{{sfn|Travers|2001|p=72}} Kitchener had ruled that air requirements must be met by the [[Royal Naval Air Service]] (RNAS) and the Allies employed a small force of seaplanes and other aircraft from [[No. 203 Squadron RAF|3 Squadron]], RNAS (Commander [[Charles Rumney Samson|Charles Samson]]) which arrived at [[Bozcaada|Tenedos]] at the end of March.{{sfn|Aspinall-Oglander|1929|p=139}} The aircraft were unopposed by the small Ottoman air force at first and during the planning, the force had been used to provide aerial reconnaissance, although this ultimately proved inadequate to meet the Allies' intelligence needs and make up for the lack of adequate maps.{{sfn|Gilbert|2013|p=43}}{{sfn|Doyle|Bennett|1999|p=12}} After the landings, Allied aircraft conducted photographic reconnaissance, observed naval gunfire, reported on Ottoman troop movements and conducted a small number of bombing raids.{{sfn|Gilbert|2013|p=43}}\n\n===ANZAC Cove===\n\nAllocated the northern landing, Birdwood's force included the 1st Australian Division (Major General [[William Bridges (general)|William Bridges]]) and the New Zealand and Australian Division (Major General [[Alexander Godley|Sir Alexander Godley]]), a force of about {{nowrap|25,000 men.}} The force was to land and advance inland to cut the lines of communication to the Ottoman forces in the south.{{sfn|Coulthard-Clark|2001|p=102}}{{sfn|Dennis et al.|2008|p=226}} The 1st Australian Division would land first, with the 3rd Infantry Brigade first as a covering force moving inland to establish positions on Gun Ridge.

The [[Royal Dublin Fusiliers]] landed at 'V' Beach and the [[Lancashire Fusiliers]] at 'W' Beach in open boats, on a shore overlooked by dunes and obstructed with barbed wire. On both beaches the Ottoman defenders occupied good defensive positions and inflicted many casualties on the British infantry as they landed.

By the morning of 25 April, out of ammunition and with nothing but [[bayonet]]s to meet the attackers on the slopes leading up from the beach to the heights of Chunuk Bair, the [[57th Infantry Regiment (Ottoman Empire)]] received orders from Kemal \"I do not order you to fight, I order you to die.

A further six Victoria Crosses were awarded among the infantry and sailors at the 'V' Beach landing and three more were awarded the following day as they fought their way inland.

While it diverted Ottoman forces away from other areas of conflict in the Middle East, the campaign also consumed resources the Allies could have employed on the Western Front,{{sfn|Doyle|Bennett|1999|p=15}} and also resulted in heavy losses on the Allied side.{{sfn|Haythornthwaite|2004|p=90}}\n\nThe Allied campaign was plagued by ill-defined goals, poor planning, insufficient artillery, inexperienced troops, inaccurate maps, poor intelligence, overconfidence, inadequate equipment, and logistical and tactical deficiencies at all levels.{{sfn|Hart|2007|pp=11\u201312}}{{sfn|Broadbent|2005|p=268}} Geography also proved a significant factor. While the Allied forces possessed inaccurate maps and intelligence and proved unable to exploit the terrain to their advantage, the Ottoman commanders were able to utilise the high ground around the Allied landing beaches to position well-sited defences that limited the ability of Allied forces to penetrate inland, confining them to narrow beaches.{{sfn|Doyle|Bennett|1999|p=12}} The campaign's necessity remains the subject of debate,{{sfn|Stevenson|2007|p=189}} and the recriminations that followed were significant, highlighting the schism that had developed between military strategists who felt the Allies should focus on fighting on the Western Front and those who favoured trying to end the war by attacking Germany's \"soft underbelly\", its allies in the east.{{sfn|Hart|2007|p=10}}\n\nBritish and French submarine operations in the Sea of Marmara were the one significant area of success of the Gallipoli campaign, forcing the Ottomans to abandon the sea as a transport route. Between April and December 1915, nine British and four French submarines carried out 15 patrols, sinking one battleship, one destroyer, five [[gunboat]]s, 11 [[troop transport]]s, 44 supply ships and 148 sailing vessels at a cost of eight Allied submarines sunk in the strait or in the Sea of Marmara.{{sfn|O'Connell|2010|pp=76\u201378}} During the campaign there was always one British submarine in the Sea of Marmara, sometimes two; in October 1915, there were four Allied submarines in the region.{{sfn|O'Connell|2010|p=73}} ''E2'' left the Sea of Marmara on 2 January 1916, the last British submarine in the region. Four E-class and five B-class submarines remained in the Mediterranean Sea following the evacuation of Helles.{{sfn|O'Connell|2010|p=78}} By this time the Ottoman navy had been all but forced to cease operations in the area, while merchant shipping had also been significantly curtailed. The official German naval historian, Admiral Eberhard von Mantey, later concluded that had the sea-lanes of communication been completely severed the Ottoman 5th Army would likely have faced catastrophe. As it was these operations were a source of significant anxiety, posing a constant threat to shipping and causing heavy losses, effectively dislocating Ottoman attempts to reinforce their forces at Gallipoli and shelling troop concentrations and railways.{{sfn|Brenchley|Brenchley|2001|pp=113\u201314}}\n\nGallipoli marked the end for Hamilton and Stopford, but Hunter-Weston went on to lead VIII Corps on the first day of the [[Battle of the Somme]].{{sfn|Broadbent|2005|pp=233, 270}}{{sfn|Neillands|2004|p= 259}} The competence of Australian brigade commanders, John Monash (4th Infantry Brigade) and [[Harry Chauvel]] ([[1st Light Horse Brigade]], New Zealand and Australian Division), was recognised by promotion to divisional and corps command.{{sfn|Grey|2008|pp=100, 107}}{{sfn|Haythornthwaite|2004|p=14}} The influence of Kitchener waned after the coalition government was formed in May 1915, partly because of the growing sense of failure in the Dardanelles and culminated in Kitchener being over-ruled on support for the French at Salonika in early December 1915, when his influence on the Cabinet was at its lowest.{{sfn|Cassar|2004|pp=202\u201303, 259, 263}} The campaign gave confidence to the Ottomans in their ability to defeat the Allies.{{sfn|Broadbent|2005|p=268}} In [[Mesopotamia]], the Turks surrounded a British expedition at [[Siege of Kut|Kut Al Amara]], forcing their surrender in April 1916.{{sfn|Baldwin|1962|p=94}} Ottoman forces in southern Palestine were poised to launch an attack against the Suez Canal and Egypt.{{sfn|Pick|1990|pp=181, 209}} Defeat at the [[Battle of Romani]], however, and lack of the materials to complete the military railway necessary for such an operation, marked the end of that ambition.{{sfn|Pick|1990|p=210}} The optimism gained from the victory at Gallipoli was replaced by a gathering sense of despair, and the British remained on the offensive in the Middle East for the rest of the war.{{sfn|Erickson|2001a|p=127}}{{sfn|Grey|2008|p=117}}\n\n[[File:Gallipoli ANZAC Cove Sphinx 2.JPG|thumb|upright=1.0|left|The Sphinx, one of the battlefield's most distinctive physical landmarks]]\n\nThe lessons of the campaign were studied by military planners prior to amphibious operations such as the [[Normandy Landings]] in 1944 and during the [[Falklands War]] in 1982.{{sfn|Wahlert|2008|p=29}}{{sfn|Holmes|2001|p=343}} The lessons of the campaign influenced US Marine Corps amphibious operations during the [[Pacific War]] and continue to influence US amphibious doctrine.{{sfn|Wahlert|2008|p=29}}{{sfn|Gatchel|1996|p=10}} In 1996, Theodore Gatchel wrote that [[interwar period|between the wars]], the campaign \"became a focal point for the study of amphibious warfare\" in Britain and United States.{{sfn|Gatchel|1996|p=10}} In 2008, Glenn Wahlert wrote that Gallipoli involved \"all four types of amphibious operations: the raid, demonstration, assault and withdrawal\".{{sfn|Wahlert|2008|p=29}}\n\n[[Russell Weigley]] wrote that analysis of the campaign before the Second World War led to \"a belief among most of the armed forces of the world\" that amphibious assaults could not succeed against modern defences and that despite landings in [[Allied invasion of Italy|Italy]], [[Battle of Tarawa|Tarawa]] and the [[Gilbert and Marshall Islands campaign|Gilberts]], arguably this perception continued until Normandy in June 1944.{{sfn|Weigley|2005|pp=393\u201396}} Hart wrote that despite the pessimistic analyses after 1918, the situation after 1940 meant that landings from the sea were unavoidable, and it was only after Normandy that the belief that opposed landings were futile was overcome.{{sfn|Hart|2013b|pp=460\u201362}} The memory of Gallipoli weighed heavily upon the Australians during the planning of the [[Huon Peninsula campaign]] in late 1943.

Asquith]] to end his [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] Government and form a Coalition Government with the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]].{{sfn|Cassar|2004|p=180}} The Asquith government responded to the disappointment and outrage over Gallipoli and Kut by establishing commissions of inquiry into both episodes, which had done much to \"destroy its faltering reputation for competence\".{{sfn|Stevenson|2005|pp=121\u201322}} The [[Dardanelles Commission]] was set up to investigate the failure of the expedition, the first report being issued in 1917, with the final report published in 1919.{{sfn|Travers|2001|p=13}} Following the failure of the Dardanelles expedition, Sir Ian Hamilton, commander of the MEF, was recalled to London in October 1915, ending his military career.{{sfn|Broadbent|2005|p=270}} Churchill was demoted from First Lord of the Admiralty as a condition of Conservative entry to the coalition but remained in the Cabinet in the [[sinecure]] of Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster.{{sfn|Holmes|2001|p=203}} Churchill resigned in November 1915 and left London for the Western Front, where he commanded an infantry battalion of the [[Royal Scots Fusiliers]] early in 1916.{{sfn|Holmes|2001|p=203}}{{sfn|Neillands|2004|p=384}}\n\nAsquith was partly blamed for Gallipoli and other disasters and was overthrown in December 1916, when [[David Lloyd George]] proposed a war council under his authority, with the Conservatives in the coalition threatening to resign unless the plan was implemented. After failure to reach agreement, Lloyd George and then Asquith resigned, followed by Lloyd George becoming Prime Minister.{{sfn|Taylor|1965|pp=103\u201306}} Lloyd George formed a new government, from which Churchill, active again in the House of Commons from June 1916, was excluded because of Conservative opposition. In the summer of 1917, Churchill was eventually appointed to the cabinet-level post of [[Minister of Munitions]] but not to the [[War cabinet#First World War|War Cabinet]].{{sfn|Holmes|2001|p=203}} The final report of the Commission was issued in 1919, concluding that with the forces available, success was dependent on the government giving priority to the expedition and leaving the British Expeditionary Force in France to make do. The Commissioners found that Hamilton had been over-optimistic from the beginning and had added to Stopford's difficulties on 8 August 1915. Hamilton emerged from the investigation more favourably than perhaps was justified, partly because he made devious attempts to gain collusion from witnesses and obtain leaks from the  deliberations of the Commission; Hamilton was never given another army appointment.{{sfn|Travers|2001|pp=297\u201398}}{{efn|The enormous casualties at Gallipoli among Irish soldiers who had volunteered to fight in the British Army was a causal factor in the [[Irish War of Independence]]; as balladeers sang, ''\"Twas better to die 'neath an Irish sky than in [[Suvla]] or [[Sedd el Bahr]]\"''.{{sfn|West|2016|p=97}}}}\n\n===Casualties===\n\n{{See also|List of war cemeteries and memorials on the Gallipoli Peninsula}}\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float: right; clear: right; margin:0 0 1em 1em\"\n|+Gallipoli casualties (not including illness){{sfn|Erickson|2001a|p=94}}{{sfn|NZ History|2016|nopp=y}}{{sfn|Aspinall-Oglander|1992|p=484}}{{sfn|Department of Veterans Affairs|p=2}}{{sfn|Lepetit|Tournyol du Clos|Rinieri|1923|p=549}}\n|-\n!Countries\n!Dead\n!Wounded\n!Missing<br />or<br />POW\n!Total\n|-style=\"background:#ccc; text-align:center;\"\n|'''Ottoman<br />Empire'''||'''56,643'''||'''97,007'''||'''11,178'''||'''164,828'''\n|-#B9B9B9\" style=\"background:#; text-align:center;\"\n|-style=\"background:#E8E8E8; text-align:center;\"\n|United Kingdom||34,072||78,520||7,654||120,246\n|-style=\"background:#E8E8E8; text-align:center;\"\n|France||9,798||17,371||\u2014||27,169\n|-style=\"background:#E8E8E8; text-align:center;\"\n|Australia||8,709||19,441||\u2014||28,150\n|-style=\"background:#E8E8E8; text-align:center;\"\n| New Zealand||2,721||4,752||\u2014||7,473\n|-style=\"background:#E8E8E8; text-align:center;\"\n| British India||1,358||3,421||\u2014||4,779\n|-style=\"background:#E8E8E8; text-align:center;\"\n| Newfoundland||49||93||\u2014||142\n|-style=\"background:#E8E8E8; text-align:center;\"\n!Total (Allies)\n!56,707\n!123,598\n!7,654\n!187,959\n|-style=\"background:#CCC; text-align:center;\"\n|}\nCasualty figures for the campaign vary between sources but in 2001, [[Edward J.

The city is close to winter skiing centres in the north and to seaside resorts on the [[Adriatic Sea]].\n\n[[Podgorica Municipality]] covers 10.4% of Montenegro's territory and is home to 29.9% of the country's population. It is the nation's administrative centre and its economic, cultural, and educational focus.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe name ''Podgorica'' means \"[area] below Gorica\". Gorica, meaning \"little hill\", is the name of one of the [[cypress]]-covered [[hillock]]s that overlook the city centre.\n\nSome three kilometres ({{convert|3|km|abbr=off|disp=output only}}) north-west of Podgorica lie the ruins of the Roman-era town of [[Doclea (town)|Doclea]], from which the [[Roman Emperor]] [[Diocletian]] hailed. In later centuries, Romans \"corrected\" the name to {{lang|la|Dioclea}}, guessing wrongly that an ''i'' had been lost in vulgar speech. {{lang|zls|Duklja}} is the later [[South Slavic languages|South Slavic]] version of that word.\n\nAt its foundation (some time before the 11th century), the town was called '''Birziminium'''. In the [[Middle Ages]], it was known as '''Ribnica''' (Montenegrin Cyrillic: {{lang|sh|\u0420\u0438\u0431\u043d\u0438\u0446\u0430}} {{IPA-sh|r\u00eebnitsa|}}). The name Podgorica was used from 1326. From 1946 to 1992, the city was [[List of places named after Tito|named]] '''Titograd''' in honour of [[Josip Broz Tito]], the former [[President of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|President of Yugoslavia]].\n\n==History==\n===Early history===\n[[File:Doclea Roman city Podgorica.jpg|thumb|left|[[Doclea (town)|Doclea]], Roman town, the seat of the Late Roman province of [[Praevalitana]].]]\n[[File:Ancient city Doclea - ruins 06.jpg|thumb|right|190px|Archeological remains of the Roman period in Doclea.]]\nPodgorica is at the [[Crossroads (culture)|crossroads]] of several historically important routes, near the rivers [[Zeta River|Zeta]], [[Mora\u010da]], [[Cijevna]], [[Ribnica (river)|Ribnica]], [[Sitnica (Mora\u010da)|Sitnica]] and [[Mareza]] in the valley of [[Lake Skadar]] and near the Adriatic Sea, in fertile lowlands with favourable climate. The earliest human settlements were in prehistory: the oldest physical remains are from the late [[Stone Age]].\n\nIn the [[Iron Age]], the area between the [[Zeta plain|Zeta]] and [[Bjelopavli\u0107i plain|Bjelopavli\u0107i valleys]] was occupied by two Illyrian tribes, the [[Labeates]] and the [[Docleatae]]. The population of the town of Doclea was 8,000\u201310,000, in which all core urban issues were resolved. The high population density (in an area of about {{convert|10|km|0|abbr=on}} radius) was made possible by the geographical position, favourable climate and economic conditions and by the defensive positions that were of great importance at that time.\n\n===Middle Ages===\nFrom the 5th century AD, with the arrival of the first [[Sclaveni|Slavic]] and [[Pannonian Avars|Avar]] tribes and the beginning of the break-up of the [[Roman Empire]], the area bore witness to many noteworthy events. {{Citation needed|date=March 2017}} With time, the fortifications ceased their function and new towns were built; a new settlement probably named after the Ribnica river, on whose banks it was built, Ribnica, was established. It was first mentioned during the reign of the [[Nemanji\u0107 dynasty]], as part of the [[Kingdom of Serbia (medieval)|Serbian kingdom]]. The importance of Ribnica was its position as crossroads in communications with the west. {{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nThe name Podgorica was first mentioned in 1326 in a court document of the [[Kotor]] archives. The city was economically strong: trade routes between the [[Republic of Ragusa]] and Serbia, well developed at that time, were maintained via the road that led to Podgorica through [[Trebinje]] and [[Nik\u0161i\u0107]]. As a busy crossroad, Podgorica was a vibrant regional centre of trade and communication. This boosted its development, economic power, military strength and strategic importance. {{Citation needed|date=June 2017}}\n\n===Ottoman Empire===\n[[File:28iulsah.jpg|thumb|View of [[Depedogen|Ribnica fortress and Old bridge]], Catholic Church (right), Debbaglar Bridge, government mansion and the Mirko Varosh Hotel (far left), before 1901.]]\n[[File:Sahat-kula in Podgorica.jpg|thumb|180px|left|[[Clock Tower (Podgorica)|City Clock Tower]].]]\nThe [[Ottoman Empire]] captured Podgorica in 1474.

The area is crossed with rivers and the city itself is only {{convert|15|km}} north of [[Lake Skadar]]. The [[Mora\u010da River|Mora\u010da]] and [[Ribnica River|Ribnica]] rivers flow through the city, while the [[Zeta River|Zeta]], [[Cijevna River|Cijevna]], [[Sitnica River|Sitnica]] and [[Mareza]] flow nearby. ''Mora\u010da'' is the largest river in the city, being {{convert|70|m|ft|abbr=on|disp=or}} wide near downtown, and having carved a {{convert|20|m|ft|abbr=on|disp=or}} deep canyon for the length of its course through the city. {{Citation needed|date=March 2017}} Except for the Mora\u010da and Zeta, other rivers have an appearance of small creeks. The richness in bodies of water is a major feature of the city.\n\nIn contrast to most of Montenegro, Podgorica lies in a mainly flat area at the northern end of the Zeta plain, at an elevation of {{convert|40|m|ft|abbr=on}}. The only exceptions are hills which overlook the city. The most significant is {{convert|130.3|m|ft|abbr=on}} high '''Gorica Hill''' ({{IPA-sh|\u02c8\u0261\u01d2rit\u035csa|pron}}), city's namesake, which rises above the city centre. The other hills include ''Malo brdo'' (\"little hill\", {{convert|205.4|m|ft|abbr=on|disp=or}}), ''Velje brdo'' (\"big hill\", {{convert|283|m|ft|abbr=on|disp=or}}), ''Ljubovi\u0107'' ({{convert|101|m|ft|abbr=on|disp=or}}) and ''Dajbapska gora'' ({{convert|172|m|ft|abbr=on|disp=or}}). For the most part, these are too steep for development and thus limit the city's expansion, especially to the north. However, urbanization has been encroaching on the lower slopes of the hills since the 1990s. \nPodgorica city proper has an area of {{convert|108|km2|sqmi}}, while actual urbanized area is much smaller.\n\n<gallery>\nPodgorica,_Montenegro_-_panoramio_(14).jpg|[[Mora\u010da]] river canyon.\nLago Skadar, Montenegro, 2014-04-14, DD 01.JPG|[[Lake Skadar]]\nNijagara_-_panoramio.jpg|River Cijevna waterfalls near Podgorica\nZagoric.JPG|Podgorica panoramic view.\n</gallery>\n\n===Climate===\n[[File:Podgorica, piazza repubblica.JPG|thumb|right|180px|[[Republic Square (Podgorica)|Independence Square]].]]\nUnder the [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]], Podgorica has a [[humid subtropical climate]] (''Cfa'' instead of ''Csa''), since there is only one summer month with less than {{convert|40|mm|in|sp=us}} of precipitation,<ref name=Peel>{{cite journal | author=Peel, M.

Although the city is only some {{convert|35|km|0|abbr=on}} north of the [[Adriatic Sea]], an arm of the Mediterranean, [[Rumija]] mountain acts as a natural [[Dinaric Alps]] barrier, separating Skadar Lake basin and Podgorica area from the sea, thus limiting temperate maritime influence on the local climate.\n\nThe mean annual rainfall is {{convert|1659|mm|in|abbr=on}}, making Podgorica by far wettest capital in Europe, [[Ljubljana]] being second with {{convert|1362|mm|in|abbr=on}}. {{Citation needed|date=April 2017}} The temperature exceeds {{convert|25|\u00b0C}} on about 135 days each year and the median daily temperature is {{convert|15.6|\u00b0C|1}}. The number of rainy days is about 120, and those with a strong wind around 60. An occasional strong northerly wind influences the climate in the winter, with a [[wind chill]] effect lowering the perceived temperature by a few degrees. {{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nThe all-time maximum snowfall record was beaten on 11 February 2012, when {{convert|58|cm|0|abbr=on}} of snowfall were measured.

This part of the city is today traditionally regarded as city centre, and is called ''Nova Varo\u0161'' (''New town'')\n\nDuring World War II, Podgorica was almost razed to the ground, being [[Bombing of Podgorica in World War II|bombed over 70 times]]. {{Citation needed|date=March 2017}} After liberation, rebuilding began as in other cities of the communist-ruled SFRY. Mass residential blocks were erected, with basic design typical of [[Eastern bloc]] countries. {{Citation needed|date=March 2017}} All that part of the city on the right bank of the [[Mora\u010da River]] was built this way.\n\nThe main contemporary traffic arteries were laid out during this period, which extended the orthogonal street layout of city center, to the south and west.

Residential and business construction are proceeding rapidly, incorporating contemporary glass-and-steel architectural trends. In an effort to create a recognizable and modern state capital, city officials are routing significant investments in city's public spaces. Thus, the city has gained entirely new squares, parks and monuments.

The Montenegrin National Theatre is the most significant theatre not only in Podgorica but in all of Montenegro. Podgorica is also host to the City Theatre (''Gradsko pozori\u0161te''), which includes the Children's Theatre and the Puppet Theatre. Although not as rich in museums and galleries as the historic royal capital [[Cetinje]], there are several noteworthy museums:\n\n[[File:Novi_Grad,_Podgorica,_Montenegro_-_panoramio_(9).jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Cathedral of the Resurrection of Christ, Podgorica|Cathedral of the Resurrection of Christ]] interior.]]\n[[File:Royal Garden in Podgorica.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Former residence of King Nikola I Petrovi\u0107, today an art gallery.]]\n[[File:Crnogorsko Narodno Pozori\u0161te.JPG|thumb|right|200px|[[Montenegrin National Theatre]]]]\n[[File:Podgorica, museo nazionale, esterno 01.JPG|thumb|left|200px|{{nowrap|National Museum of Montenegro}}]]\n* The Podgorica City Museum (''Muzej grada Podgorice'') preserves Podgorica's rich heritage. Founded in 1950, it has four categories: archaeological, ethnographic, historical and cultural-historical. It houses artefacts which date back to the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] and [[Illyria]]n eras. {{citation needed|date=October 2017}}\n* The Archaeological Research Centre (''Centar za arheolo\u0161ka istra\u017eivanja'') was founded in 1961.

This museum has no exhibition space of its own, despite many proposals and initiatives to build one. {{Citation needed|date=June 2017}}\nThere is a notable art gallery in the ''Dvorac'' [[House of Petrovi\u0107|''Petrovi\u0107a'']] ([[Podgorica Royal Palace|Petrovi\u0107 Castle]]) complex in Podgorica's largest public park. [[Nicholas I of Montenegro|King Nicholas]]'s castle, ''Perjani\u010dki Dom'' (House of the Honour Guard), castle chapel and surrounding buildings were converted to an art gallery in 1984. Since 1995, it has been part of the Modern Arts Centre (''Centar savremenih umjetnosti'') and houses approximately 1,500 works of art. The historic Cinema of Culture (''Kino Kultura''), which was founded in 1949, was closed in November 2008 due to continuous financial losses it generated. It was the only cinema in the city for 6 decades. The building of the former cinema will be converted to host the Podgorica City Theatre. Shortly after its closure, a [[Ster-Kinekor]] (later acquired by [[Cineplexx Cinemas|Cineplexx]]) 6-screen [[Multiplex (movie theater)|multiplex]] cinema opened at [[Delta City]] shopping mall.\n\nA significant cultural institution of over fifty years' standing is the Budo Tomovi\u0107 Cultural-Informational Centre (''KIC Budo Tomovi\u0107''). It is a public institution which organizes various artistic events, including Podgorica Cultural Summer (''Podgori\u010dko Kulturno Ljeto''), FIAT \u2013 International Alternative Theatre Festival (''Festival Internacionalnog Alternativnog Teatra''), DEUS \u2013 December Arts Scene (''Decembarska Umjetni\u010dka Scena'').\n\n==Media==\nPodgorica is the media hub of Montenegro. It is home to the headquarters of the state-owned [[public television]] broadcaster [[RTCG]]. Commercial broadcasters in Podgorica include [[RTV A1]], [[TV Vijesti]], [[Nova M]] and [[Prva TV]]. It was announced that the city's local television will be launched soon.<ref>[http://www.cgvijesti.net/209191_Mugosa-Podgorica-dobija-svoju-televiziju.html Mugo\u0161a: Podgorica dobija svoju televiziju] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723040909/http://www.cgvijesti.net/209191_Mugosa-Podgorica-dobija-svoju-televiziju.html |date=23 July 2011 }}</ref> Their programmes can be received in much of Montenegro.\n\nAll Montenegro's daily newspapers (oldest Montenegrin daily newspaper ''[[Pobjeda]]'', ''[[Vijesti]]'', ''[[Dnevne Novine]]'' and ''[[Dan (newspaper)|Dan]]'') are published in Podgorica, as the weekly magazines ''[[The Monitor (Montenegro)|Monitor]]'' and ''[[Magazin BIT]]''.\n\n==Sports==\n[[File:Novi_Grad,_Podgorica,_Montenegro_-_panoramio_(34).jpg|thumb|right|[[Mora\u010da Sports Center]].]]\nThe most popular sports by far are [[association football|football]] and [[basketball]]. Basketball became especially popular with the success in the late 20th and early 21st centuries of [[KK Budu\u0107nost Podgorica|KK Budu\u0107nost]], both in [[ABA League|Regional]] and European competitions.\n\nFootball in Podgorica has a long tradition associated with [[FK Budu\u0107nost Podgorica|Budu\u0107nost]]. World-famous players [[Predrag Mijatovi\u0107]] and [[Dejan Savi\u0107evi\u0107]] were born in Podgorica and made their debut in that team. The club [[FK Zeta]] from the Podgorica suburb of [[Golubovci]] has also reached the former first league of Serbia and Montenegro. These clubs, along with [[FK Sutjeska Nik\u0161i\u0107|Sutjeska]] from Nik\u0161i\u0107, usually compete with each other for leading position in the [[First League of Montenegro]].\nOther clubs from Podgorica and its surroundings play in the Montenegrin First League e.g. [[OFK Titograd]] & [[FK Kom|Kom]]. One of the most popular clubs from the suburbs is [[FK Ribnica]] from [[Konik, Montenegro|Konik]], [[FK Zabjelo]] from [[Zabjelo]] and [[OFK Mladost Lje\u0161kopolje|OFK Mladost 1970]] from ''Donja Gorica''.\n\nThe volleyball team [[OK Budu\u0107nost Podgorica|OK Budu\u0107nost]] and the women's handball team [[\u017dRK Budu\u0107nost T-Mobile]] have had significant success in European competition. [[Budu\u0107nost Podgorica]] is the most important sports club in Podgorica. Its name means ''Future''.\n\n[[Chess]] is another popular sport and some famous global chess players, like [[Slavko Dedi\u0107]], are born in Podgorica.\n\nSporting events like the annual [[Podgorica Marathon]] and the ''Mora\u010da River'' jumps attract international competitors.\nPodgorica was the host of [[2009 FINA Men's Water Polo World League]].\n\n===Venues===\n[[File:PodgoricaCityStadium2017.jpeg|thumb|right|[[Podgorica City Stadium]]]]\nPodgorica has a number of sporting venues; some are under reconstruction and expansion. The main ones are:\n*[[Podgorica City Stadium]]. It has a capacity of 11,264 and it is the home of [[FK Budu\u0107nost Podgorica]] and the [[Montenegro national football team]]. It is currently the only venue in Montenegro that complies with [[FIFA]] standards for international football matches.\n*[[Mora\u010da Sports Center]], a multi functional indoor sport facility. It has a capacity of 6 000 seats. It hosted one group of [[EuroBasket 2005]], while other games were played in [[Belgrade Arena|Belgrade]], [[Millennium Centar|Vr\u0161ac]], and [[Spens Sports Center|Novi Sad]].\n\nAlmost every football club in Podgorica has its own stadium, although these are often only fields with small stands or no stands at all.\nOther notable venues are the [[Stadion malih sportova]] under Gorica hill and the [[sport shooting]] range under Ljubovi\u0107 hill. There are many other sports facilities around the city, most notably [[indoor soccer]] fields.\n\n==Economy==\n[[File:Podgorica_National_bank_of_Montenegro.JPG|thumb|left|Central Bank of Montenegro.]]\n[[File:Podgorica-Tuzi plantaze wineyard IMG 1318 Cijevna river.JPG|thumb|right|Aerial view of the [[Planta\u017ee]] wineyard, this wine field is the largest single one in Europe.]]\nPodgorica is not only the administrative centre of Montenegro, but also its main economic engine. Most of Montenegro's industrial, financial, and commercial base is in Podgorica. {{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\nBefore World War I, most of Podgorica's economy was in trade and small-scale manufacture, which was an economic model established during the long rule of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. {{Citation needed|date=April 2017}} After World War II, Podgorica became Montenegro's capital and a focus of the rapid urbanization and industrialization of the SFRY era. Industries such as aluminium and tobacco processing, [[textile industry|textiles]], engineering, vehicle production, and wine production were established in and around the city. In 1981, Podgorica's GDP per capita was 87% of the Yugoslav average.<ref>{{cite book | title=Atlas svijeta: Novi pogled na Zemlju | year=1984 | edition=3rd | publisher=Sveu\u010dili\u0161na naklada Liber | location=Zagreb | language=Croatian | editor1-first=Radovan | editor1-last=Radovinovi\u0107 | editor2-first=Ivan | editor2-last=Berti\u0107}}</ref>\n\nIn the early 1990s, the [[Breakup of Yugoslavia|dissolution of Yugoslavia]], [[Yugoslav wars]], and the [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 757|UN-imposed sanctions]] left Podgorica's industries without traditional markets, suppliers, and available funds. This, combined with typical [[Transition economy|transition]] pressures, led to a decline of the industrial base, where many industries collapsed leaving thousands of citizens unemployed. {{Citation needed|date=March 2017}} However, some of the industries, including [[Podgorica Aluminium Plant|Podgorica aluminium smelter]] and [[Planta\u017ee]], managed to survive the turmoil of the 1990s, and are still major contributors to Montenegrin export and industrial output to this day.\n\nAs Montenegro began its push for independence from Serbia in the late 1990s, Podgorica greatly benefited from increased concentration of government and service sectors. {{Citation needed|date=March 2017}} In addition to almost the entire country's government, Podgorica is home to the [[Montenegro Stock Exchange]] and other major Montenegrin financial institutions, along with telecommunications carriers, media outlets, [[Montenegro Airlines|Montenegrin flag carrier airline]], and other significant institutions and companies.\n\nThe large presence of government and service sectors spared the economy of Podgorica from prolonged stagnation in the [[Great Recession|late 2000s recession]], which hit Montenegro hard. Although, in mid-2014, some 30% of Montenegro's citizens lived in Podgorica, the municipality accounted for 44% of the country's employed. Out of the entire mass of paid nwt salaries in Montenegro in that year, some 47% was paid in Podgorica. The average monthly net salary in May, 2014 was \u20ac509 in Podgorica municipality.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.monstat.org/userfiles/file/publikacije/2014/6/zaposlenost%20i%20zarade.pdf |title=Monthly Statistical Review, no. 6/2014 |format=pdf|publisher=Monstat |date=2014-05-05 |accessdate=2014-10-13}}</ref>\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Capital Plaza of Podgorica Trg Svetog Petra Cetinjskog IMG 1291 Ulitsa Dr Ljubomira Ra\u0161ovi\u0107a.jpg|The Capital Plaza\nFile:Telenor.JPG|Telenor Center\nFile:DeltaPG.JPG|Delta City\nFile:PC Kru\u0161evac.JPG|TC Kru\u0161evac\n</gallery>\n\n==Demographics==\n{{Further|Demographics of Podgorica}}\n{{Historical populations\n|type =\n|1948|14369 |1953|19868 |1961|35054 |1971|61727 |1981|96074 |1991|117875 |2003|136473 |2011|150977 |2018|199715\n|\n}}\n\nAlthough medium-sized by European standards, Podgorica is by far the largest city in [[Montenegro]]: almost one third of Montenegrin citizens live there. According to the 2011 census, there are 185,937 people in Podgorica Capital City, which is analogous to metropolitan area, and includes the small towns of [[Tuzi]] and [[Golubovci]], while 150,977 people live within the city proper.\n\nOut of the total population of Podgorica, 48.73% are male, while 51.27% are female. The average age of the population is 35.7. [[Serbian language|Serbian]] is the most spoken language, with 42.4% of Podgorica citizens declaring it as their first language. It is followed closely by [[Montenegrin language|Montenegrin]], at 41.17%. Other significant languages spoken in Podgorica are [[Albanian language|Albanian]] (5.53%) and [[Romani language|Romani]] (1.81%).\n\nThe majority of Podgorica citizens are [[Orthodox Christians]] (78.27%), while there are significant minorities of [[Muslims]] (11.23%) and [[Catholic Church|Catholics]] (4.27%).\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! width=\"100\" | Nationality (2011 census)\n! width=\"80\" | Number\n! width=\"80\" | Percentage\n|-\n| [[Montenegrins]] || 106,642 || 57.35%\n|-\n| [[Serbs]] || 43,248 || 23.26%\n|-\n| [[Albanians]] || 9,538 || 5.13%\n|-\n| [[Muslims by nationality|Muslims]] || 4,122 || 2.22%\n|-\n| [[Bosniaks]] || 3,687\t || 1,98%\n|-\n| [[Romani people|Romani]] || 3,988 || 2.14%\n|-\n| others || 5,820 || 3.13%\n|-\n| undeclared || 8,892 || 4.78%'''\n|}\n\n==Religion==\n[[File:Podgorica, cattedrale della resurrezione di cristo, esterno 01.JPG|thumb|right|200px|[[Cathedral of the Resurrection of Christ, Podgorica|Cathedral of Podgorica]].]]\n[[File:Manastir Dajbabe - panoramio (2).jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Dajbabe Monastery]].]]\n\nPodgorica is home to three main religious groups: [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christians]], [[Sunni Islam|Sunni Muslims]] and [[Catholicism|Catholic Christians]].\n\nOrthodox Christian population mostly originates from the local [[Montenegrins (ethnic group)|Montenegrin]] and [[Serb]] population, which accepted [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christianity]] in Middle Ages after a major split during [[East\u2013West Schism|The Great Schism]]. They represent the major religious group. There are various Eastern Orthodox churches in the City such as St. George Church which originates from the 13th century, or [[Cathedral of the Resurrection of Christ (Podgorica)|Cathedral of the Resurrection of Christ]] which is the largest church in the city to have been recently erected.\nThe [[Muslims|Muslim]] population mostly originates from local [[Bosniaks]], as well as [[Albanians]].\n\nThere are several mosques in Podgorica and [[Tuzi]]. Catholic population mainly consists of local Albanian minority. The main religious site for the Catholic population located in the [[Konik, Montenegro|Konik neighbourhood]] is the [[Church of the Holy Heart of Jesus (Podgorica)|Church of the Holy Heart of Jesus]] constructed in 1966, in [[Brutalist architecture|Brutalist]] style which makes this object unique.

The city assembly has 59 members, elected directly for four-year terms. The mayor used to be directly elected for five-year term, but since the new law was introduced in Montenegrin municipalities mayors will be elected by the city assembly and will have to maintain its support during his term. Separate elections are held for the local sub-division of [[Golubovci]] since it is part of their administrative autonomy inside Podgorica municipality. Constant questions are raised by various politicians over gaining separate municipality status for [[Golubovci]]. In 2018, [[Tuzi Municipality|Tuzi]] became its own municipality after a vote on the Montenegrin Parliament.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdm.me/english/tuzi-will-become-independent-municipality/|title=Tuzi became its own Municipality.}}</ref>\n\nOn local elections held on 25 May 2014, the [[Democratic Party of Socialists]] won 29 seats in the municipal assembly, one short of 30 needed to form a majority. [[Democratic Front (Montenegro)|Democratic Front]] won 17 seats, [[Socialist People's Party of Montenegro|SNP]] won 8 seats, while coalition made of [[Positive Montenegro]] and [[Social Democratic Party of Montenegro|SDP]] won 5 seats. After lengthy negotiations, SDP dissolved coalition with Pozitivna, and made arrangement on forming majority with DPS, similar to one they have in national government. While SDP is longtime partner of DPS at national level, it has been in opposition in Podgorica municipal assembly in 2010-2014 period. \nSince October 2014, position of the mayor is held by [[Democratic Party of Socialists|DPS]] official, Slavoljub Stijepovi\u0107, replacing Podgorica mayor od 14 years, [[Miomir Mugo\u0161a]].\n\n===City Assembly===\n{{see|Podgorica City Assembly election, 2018}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:left;\"\n!colspan=2|Party/Coalition\n!Seats\n!Local government\n|-\n! style=\"background-color: #F6931D\" |\n| [[Democratic Party of Socialists of Montenegro|Democratic Party of Socialists]] \n| {{Composition bar|32|60|hex=#F6931D}}\n| {{yes|Government}}\n|-\n! style=\"background-color: red\" |\n| [[Democratic Montenegro]] \n| {{Composition bar|12|60|hex=#FF0000}}\n| {{no|Opposition}}\n|-\n! style=\"background-color: darkred\" |\n| [[United Reform Action]]\n| {{Composition bar|5|60|hex=darkred}}\n| {{no|Opposition}}\n|-\n! style=\"background-color: darkblue\" |\n| [[Democratic Front (Montenegro)|Democratic Front]] \n| {{Composition bar|5|60|hex=darkblue}}\n| {{no|Opposition}}\n|-\n! style=\"background-color: cornflowerblue\" |\n| [[Socialist People's Party of Montenegro|Socialist People's Party]]\n| {{Composition bar|3|60|hex=cornflowerblue}}\n| {{no|Opposition}}\n|-\n! style=\"background-color: #fd00ff\" |\n| [[Social Democrats of Montenegro|Social Democrats]] \n| {{Composition bar|3|60|hex=#fd00ff}}\n| {{yes|Government}}\n|-\n! style=\"background-color: blue\" |\n| [[Albanian Alternative]]\n| {{Composition bar|1|60|hex=blue}}\n| {{no|Opposition}}\n|}\n\n===Local subdivisions===\n{{Main|Subdivisions of Podgorica}}\n\nThe municipality of Podgorica consists of ''Podgorica City Proper'' and one subdivision (called ''[[city municipality]],'' \u0433\u0440\u0430\u0434\u0441\u043a\u0435 \u043e\u043f\u0448\u0442\u0438\u043d\u0435, ''gradske op\u0161tine''), which is [[Golubovci]].\n\nThe entire municipality of Podgorica is further divided into 57 ''[[local community|local communities]]'' (\u043c\u0458\u0435\u0441\u043d\u0435 \u0437\u0430\u0458\u0435\u0434\u043d\u0438\u0446\u0435, ''mjesne zajednice''), bodies in which the citizens participate in decisions on matters of relevance to the local community.\n\n==Education==\n\nMost of Montenegro's higher education establishments are in Podgorica.

In the meantime, the number of private institutions for higher education has increased, like [[University of Donja Gorica|UDG - University of Donja Gorica]]. The municipality of Podgorica has 34 elementary schools and 10 secondary schools, including one [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]]. The first secondary school established in Podgorica is [[Gymnasium \"Slobodan \u0160kerovi\u0107\"]]. The rebuilt economic high school offers new features and higher quality education.

The company went bankrupt in 2001, and buses were since operated solely by private carriers.\n\nPublic transport faces competition from very popular dispatched taxi services. De-regulation and stiff competition has made taxi services very affordable. {{Citation needed|date=August 2017}} Over 20 taxi companies are operating in Podgorica with close to 800 vehicles in service. {{citation needed|date=December 2017}} Usually, taxi companies provide a high level of service, with relatively new and uniform car fleets and [[GPS]]-tracked vehicles.\n\n===Roads===\n[[File:Sozina-Tunnel.png|thumb|350px|[[Sozina Tunnel]] shortens the journey from Podgorica to Montenegro's main port [[Bar, Montenegro|Bar]], by some 25 km.]]\nPodgorica's location in central Montenegro makes it a natural hub for rail and road transport. Roads in Montenegro (especially those connecting Podgorica to northern Montenegro and [[Serbia]]) are usually inferior to modern European roads. Both major Montenegrin motorway projects, [[A-1 motorway (Montenegro)|Bar-Boljare motorway]] and [[Adriatic\u2013Ionian motorway#Montenegro|Nudo\u2013Bo\u017eaj motorway]], will pass near Podgorica. The newly built [[Sozina tunnel]] (4.2&nbsp;km) shortened the journey from Podgorica to [[Bar, Montenegro|Bar]] (Montenegro's main seaport) to under 30 minutes. Also a new road bypass has been constructed in 2011, to remove transport routes from north to south of the country, out of the city centre. A south-western bypass has also been planned {{citation needed|date=August 2017}}, with same goal of moving heavy transport out of the city core. Podgorica is also characteristic for its extensive network of multi-lane boulevards which make inner city transport quick and effective. Traffic over the [[Mora\u010da River]] also goes fluently since river banks are very well connected with 6 vehicular and 3 pedestrian bridges.\n\nThe current main transit connections of Podgorica are:\n* north ([[European route E65|E65]], [[European route E80|E80]]), towards [[Belgrade]] and on to Central Europe\n* west ([[European route E762|E762]]), towards [[Nik\u0161i\u0107]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia]] and on to Western Europe\n* south ([[European route E65|E65]], [[European route E80|E80]]) towards the [[Adriatic coast]]\n* east ([[European route E762|E762]]), towards [[Albania]]\n\n===Rail===\n[[File:01.10.13 Podgorica 6111.101 & 461.040 (10101220063).jpg|thumb|[[Podgorica Rail Station]].]]\nPodgorica is a hub of the X-shaped [[Railways of Montenegro|Montenegrin rail network]].

The station itself is located {{convert|1.5|km|2|abbr=on}} to the southeast of the main city square. Podgorica's main railway link (for both passenger and freight traffic) is Belgrade\u2013Bar.  The link to [[Nik\u0161i\u0107]] was recently under reconstruction ([[Railway electrification system|electrification]]);<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.montenegroberza.com/code/navigate.asp?Id=718|title=U \u017deljeznicu ula\u017eu 52 miliona eura}}</ref> afterwards, passenger service started in October 2012. The rail link to [[Shkod\u00ebr]] is currently used as freight-only.\n\n===Air===\n[[File:Podgorica airport.jpg|thumb|[[Podgorica Airport]] near [[Golubovci]].]]\n[[Podgorica Airport]] is located in [[Zeta Plain]], {{convert|11|km|mi|abbr=on}} south of Podgorica City centre, and is Montenegro's main international airport.

The city is close to winter skiing centres in the north and to seaside resorts on the [[Adriatic Sea]].\n\n[[Podgorica Municipality]] covers 10.4% of Montenegro's territory and is home to 29.9% of the country's population. It is the nation's administrative centre and its economic, cultural, and educational focus.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe name ''Podgorica'' means \"[area] below Gorica\". Gorica, meaning \"little hill\", is the name of one of the [[cypress]]-covered [[hillock]]s that overlook the city centre.\n\nSome three kilometres ({{convert|3|km|abbr=off|disp=output only}}) north-west of Podgorica lie the ruins of the Roman-era town of [[Doclea (town)|Doclea]], from which the [[Roman Emperor]] [[Diocletian]] hailed. In later centuries, Romans \"corrected\" the name to {{lang|la|Dioclea}}, guessing wrongly that an ''i'' had been lost in vulgar speech. {{lang|zls|Duklja}} is the later [[South Slavic languages|South Slavic]] version of that word.\n\nAt its foundation (some time before the 11th century), the town was called '''Birziminium'''. In the [[Middle Ages]], it was known as '''Ribnica''' (Montenegrin Cyrillic: {{lang|sh|\u0420\u0438\u0431\u043d\u0438\u0446\u0430}} {{IPA-sh|r\u00eebnitsa|}}). The name Podgorica was used from 1326. From 1946 to 1992, the city was [[List of places named after Tito|named]] '''Titograd''' in honour of [[Josip Broz Tito]], the former [[President of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|President of Yugoslavia]].\n\n==History==\n===Early history===\n[[File:Doclea Roman city Podgorica.jpg|thumb|left|[[Doclea (town)|Doclea]], Roman town, the seat of the Late Roman province of [[Praevalitana]].]]\n[[File:Ancient city Doclea - ruins 06.jpg|thumb|right|190px|Archeological remains of the Roman period in Doclea.]]\nPodgorica is at the [[Crossroads (culture)|crossroads]] of several historically important routes, near the rivers [[Zeta River|Zeta]], [[Mora\u010da]], [[Cijevna]], [[Ribnica (river)|Ribnica]], [[Sitnica (Mora\u010da)|Sitnica]] and [[Mareza]] in the valley of [[Lake Skadar]] and near the Adriatic Sea, in fertile lowlands with favourable climate. The earliest human settlements were in prehistory: the oldest physical remains are from the late [[Stone Age]].\n\nIn the [[Iron Age]], the area between the [[Zeta plain|Zeta]] and [[Bjelopavli\u0107i plain|Bjelopavli\u0107i valleys]] was occupied by two Illyrian tribes, the [[Labeates]] and the [[Docleatae]]. The population of the town of Doclea was 8,000\u201310,000, in which all core urban issues were resolved. The high population density (in an area of about {{convert|10|km|0|abbr=on}} radius) was made possible by the geographical position, favourable climate and economic conditions and by the defensive positions that were of great importance at that time.\n\n===Middle Ages===\nFrom the 5th century AD, with the arrival of the first [[Sclaveni|Slavic]] and [[Pannonian Avars|Avar]] tribes and the beginning of the break-up of the [[Roman Empire]], the area bore witness to many noteworthy events. {{Citation needed|date=March 2017}} With time, the fortifications ceased their function and new towns were built; a new settlement probably named after the Ribnica river, on whose banks it was built, Ribnica, was established. It was first mentioned during the reign of the [[Nemanji\u0107 dynasty]], as part of the [[Kingdom of Serbia (medieval)|Serbian kingdom]]. The importance of Ribnica was its position as crossroads in communications with the west. {{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nThe name Podgorica was first mentioned in 1326 in a court document of the [[Kotor]] archives. The city was economically strong: trade routes between the [[Republic of Ragusa]] and Serbia, well developed at that time, were maintained via the road that led to Podgorica through [[Trebinje]] and [[Nik\u0161i\u0107]]. As a busy crossroad, Podgorica was a vibrant regional centre of trade and communication. This boosted its development, economic power, military strength and strategic importance. {{Citation needed|date=June 2017}}\n\n===Ottoman Empire===\n[[File:28iulsah.jpg|thumb|View of [[Depedogen|Ribnica fortress and Old bridge]], Catholic Church (right), Debbaglar Bridge, government mansion and the Mirko Varosh Hotel (far left), before 1901.]]\n[[File:Sahat-kula in Podgorica.jpg|thumb|180px|left|[[Clock Tower (Podgorica)|City Clock Tower]].]]\nThe [[Ottoman Empire]] captured Podgorica in 1474.

This part of the city is today traditionally regarded as city centre, and is called ''Nova Varo\u0161'' (''New town'')\n\nDuring World War II, Podgorica was almost razed to the ground, being [[Bombing of Podgorica in World War II|bombed over 70 times]]. {{Citation needed|date=March 2017}} After liberation, rebuilding began as in other cities of the communist-ruled SFRY. Mass residential blocks were erected, with basic design typical of [[Eastern bloc]] countries. {{Citation needed|date=March 2017}} All that part of the city on the right bank of the [[Mora\u010da River]] was built this way.\n\nThe main contemporary traffic arteries were laid out during this period, which extended the orthogonal street layout of city center, to the south and west. Residential and infrastructural developments in the SFRY era have mostly shaped the layout of today's Podgorica, and accommodated the unprecedented population growth that followed World War II. {{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\n<gallery>\nSaborniHram.JPG|[[Roman Square (Podgorica)|Roman Square]] and [[Cathedral of the Resurrection of Christ, Podgorica|Cathedral of Podgorica]].\nMost_Bla\u017ea_Jovanovi\u0107a.jpg|[[Bla\u017eo Jovanovi\u0107 Bridge]] over the Mora\u010da.\nPodgorica_EKIP_and_Prva_TV_IMG_1286_82_Bulevar_D%C5%BEord%C5%BEa_Va%C5%A1ingtona.JPG|Office building at George Washington Street\nBlok_5_i_6.jpg|Highrise housing in Podgorica.\nDelta City - panoramio.jpg|[[Delta Holding|Delta Shopping Mall]].\nBulevar Svetog Petra Cetinjskog, 2019.jpg|[[Peter I of Montenegro|St Peter of Cetinje]] Boulevard\nAerodromPodgorica.jpg|[[Podgorica Airport]]\nMora\u010da Sports Center.jpg|[[Mora\u010da Sports Center]]\n</gallery>\n\nA major advance in Podgorica architecture began in the late 1990s and, since then, the face of the city has changed rapidly. Residential and business construction are proceeding rapidly, incorporating contemporary glass-and-steel architectural trends. In an effort to create a recognizable and modern state capital, city officials are routing significant investments in city's public spaces. Thus, the city has gained entirely new squares, parks and monuments. New landmarks include the ''Hristovog Vaskrsenja'' [[Orthodox temple (church)|orthodox temple]] and the [[Millennium Bridge, Podgorica|Millennium Bridge]], the main feature of the Podgorica skyline. \n{{wide image|Dva_mosta_Podgorica_banner.jpg|1400px|A panoramic view of the [[Moscow bridge]] (right) and the [[Millennium Bridge (Montenegro)|Millennium Bridge]] (left).

The Montenegrin National Theatre is the most significant theatre not only in Podgorica but in all of Montenegro. Podgorica is also host to the City Theatre (''Gradsko pozori\u0161te''), which includes the Children's Theatre and the Puppet Theatre. Although not as rich in museums and galleries as the historic royal capital [[Cetinje]], there are several noteworthy museums:\n\n[[File:Novi_Grad,_Podgorica,_Montenegro_-_panoramio_(9).jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Cathedral of the Resurrection of Christ, Podgorica|Cathedral of the Resurrection of Christ]] interior.]]\n[[File:Royal Garden in Podgorica.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Former residence of King Nikola I Petrovi\u0107, today an art gallery.]]\n[[File:Crnogorsko Narodno Pozori\u0161te.JPG|thumb|right|200px|[[Montenegrin National Theatre]]]]\n[[File:Podgorica, museo nazionale, esterno 01.JPG|thumb|left|200px|{{nowrap|National Museum of Montenegro}}]]\n* The Podgorica City Museum (''Muzej grada Podgorice'') preserves Podgorica's rich heritage. Founded in 1950, it has four categories: archaeological, ethnographic, historical and cultural-historical. It houses artefacts which date back to the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] and [[Illyria]]n eras. {{citation needed|date=October 2017}}\n* The Archaeological Research Centre (''Centar za arheolo\u0161ka istra\u017eivanja'') was founded in 1961. Its mission is to gather, classify, restore and display archaeological sites.\n* The [[Marko Miljanov]] Museum (''Muzej Marka Miljanova'') in [[Medun]] shows life in 19th century Montenegro. \n* The Natural History Museum (''Prirodnja\u010dki muzej'') displays specimens of Montenegrin flora and fauna. This museum has no exhibition space of its own, despite many proposals and initiatives to build one. {{Citation needed|date=June 2017}}\nThere is a notable art gallery in the ''Dvorac'' [[House of Petrovi\u0107|''Petrovi\u0107a'']] ([[Podgorica Royal Palace|Petrovi\u0107 Castle]]) complex in Podgorica's largest public park. [[Nicholas I of Montenegro|King Nicholas]]'s castle, ''Perjani\u010dki Dom'' (House of the Honour Guard), castle chapel and surrounding buildings were converted to an art gallery in 1984. Since 1995, it has been part of the Modern Arts Centre (''Centar savremenih umjetnosti'') and houses approximately 1,500 works of art. The historic Cinema of Culture (''Kino Kultura''), which was founded in 1949, was closed in November 2008 due to continuous financial losses it generated. It was the only cinema in the city for 6 decades. The building of the former cinema will be converted to host the Podgorica City Theatre. Shortly after its closure, a [[Ster-Kinekor]] (later acquired by [[Cineplexx Cinemas|Cineplexx]]) 6-screen [[Multiplex (movie theater)|multiplex]] cinema opened at [[Delta City]] shopping mall.\n\nA significant cultural institution of over fifty years' standing is the Budo Tomovi\u0107 Cultural-Informational Centre (''KIC Budo Tomovi\u0107''). It is a public institution which organizes various artistic events, including Podgorica Cultural Summer (''Podgori\u010dko Kulturno Ljeto''), FIAT \u2013 International Alternative Theatre Festival (''Festival Internacionalnog Alternativnog Teatra''), DEUS \u2013 December Arts Scene (''Decembarska Umjetni\u010dka Scena'').\n\n==Media==\nPodgorica is the media hub of Montenegro. It is home to the headquarters of the state-owned [[public television]] broadcaster [[RTCG]]. Commercial broadcasters in Podgorica include [[RTV A1]], [[TV Vijesti]], [[Nova M]] and [[Prva TV]]. It was announced that the city's local television will be launched soon.<ref>[http://www.cgvijesti.net/209191_Mugosa-Podgorica-dobija-svoju-televiziju.html Mugo\u0161a: Podgorica dobija svoju televiziju] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723040909/http://www.cgvijesti.net/209191_Mugosa-Podgorica-dobija-svoju-televiziju.html |date=23 July 2011 }}</ref> Their programmes can be received in much of Montenegro.\n\nAll Montenegro's daily newspapers (oldest Montenegrin daily newspaper ''[[Pobjeda]]'', ''[[Vijesti]]'', ''[[Dnevne Novine]]'' and ''[[Dan (newspaper)|Dan]]'') are published in Podgorica, as the weekly magazines ''[[The Monitor (Montenegro)|Monitor]]'' and ''[[Magazin BIT]]''.\n\n==Sports==\n[[File:Novi_Grad,_Podgorica,_Montenegro_-_panoramio_(34).jpg|thumb|right|[[Mora\u010da Sports Center]].]]\nThe most popular sports by far are [[association football|football]] and [[basketball]]. Basketball became especially popular with the success in the late 20th and early 21st centuries of [[KK Budu\u0107nost Podgorica|KK Budu\u0107nost]], both in [[ABA League|Regional]] and European competitions.\n\nFootball in Podgorica has a long tradition associated with [[FK Budu\u0107nost Podgorica|Budu\u0107nost]]. World-famous players [[Predrag Mijatovi\u0107]] and [[Dejan Savi\u0107evi\u0107]] were born in Podgorica and made their debut in that team. The club [[FK Zeta]] from the Podgorica suburb of [[Golubovci]] has also reached the former first league of Serbia and Montenegro. These clubs, along with [[FK Sutjeska Nik\u0161i\u0107|Sutjeska]] from Nik\u0161i\u0107, usually compete with each other for leading position in the [[First League of Montenegro]].\nOther clubs from Podgorica and its surroundings play in the Montenegrin First League e.g. [[OFK Titograd]] & [[FK Kom|Kom]]. One of the most popular clubs from the suburbs is [[FK Ribnica]] from [[Konik, Montenegro|Konik]], [[FK Zabjelo]] from [[Zabjelo]] and [[OFK Mladost Lje\u0161kopolje|OFK Mladost 1970]] from ''Donja Gorica''.\n\nThe volleyball team [[OK Budu\u0107nost Podgorica|OK Budu\u0107nost]] and the women's handball team [[\u017dRK Budu\u0107nost T-Mobile]] have had significant success in European competition. [[Budu\u0107nost Podgorica]] is the most important sports club in Podgorica. Its name means ''Future''.\n\n[[Chess]] is another popular sport and some famous global chess players, like [[Slavko Dedi\u0107]], are born in Podgorica.\n\nSporting events like the annual [[Podgorica Marathon]] and the ''Mora\u010da River'' jumps attract international competitors.\nPodgorica was the host of [[2009 FINA Men's Water Polo World League]].\n\n===Venues===\n[[File:PodgoricaCityStadium2017.jpeg|thumb|right|[[Podgorica City Stadium]]]]\nPodgorica has a number of sporting venues; some are under reconstruction and expansion. The main ones are:\n*[[Podgorica City Stadium]]. It has a capacity of 11,264 and it is the home of [[FK Budu\u0107nost Podgorica]] and the [[Montenegro national football team]]. It is currently the only venue in Montenegro that complies with [[FIFA]] standards for international football matches.\n*[[Mora\u010da Sports Center]], a multi functional indoor sport facility. It has a capacity of 6 000 seats. It hosted one group of [[EuroBasket 2005]], while other games were played in [[Belgrade Arena|Belgrade]], [[Millennium Centar|Vr\u0161ac]], and [[Spens Sports Center|Novi Sad]].\n\nAlmost every football club in Podgorica has its own stadium, although these are often only fields with small stands or no stands at all.\nOther notable venues are the [[Stadion malih sportova]] under Gorica hill and the [[sport shooting]] range under Ljubovi\u0107 hill. There are many other sports facilities around the city, most notably [[indoor soccer]] fields.\n\n==Economy==\n[[File:Podgorica_National_bank_of_Montenegro.JPG|thumb|left|Central Bank of Montenegro.]]\n[[File:Podgorica-Tuzi plantaze wineyard IMG 1318 Cijevna river.JPG|thumb|right|Aerial view of the [[Planta\u017ee]] wineyard, this wine field is the largest single one in Europe.]]\nPodgorica is not only the administrative centre of Montenegro, but also its main economic engine. Most of Montenegro's industrial, financial, and commercial base is in Podgorica. {{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\nBefore World War I, most of Podgorica's economy was in trade and small-scale manufacture, which was an economic model established during the long rule of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. {{Citation needed|date=April 2017}} After World War II, Podgorica became Montenegro's capital and a focus of the rapid urbanization and industrialization of the SFRY era. Industries such as aluminium and tobacco processing, [[textile industry|textiles]], engineering, vehicle production, and wine production were established in and around the city. In 1981, Podgorica's GDP per capita was 87% of the Yugoslav average.<ref>{{cite book | title=Atlas svijeta: Novi pogled na Zemlju | year=1984 | edition=3rd | publisher=Sveu\u010dili\u0161na naklada Liber | location=Zagreb | language=Croatian | editor1-first=Radovan | editor1-last=Radovinovi\u0107 | editor2-first=Ivan | editor2-last=Berti\u0107}}</ref>\n\nIn the early 1990s, the [[Breakup of Yugoslavia|dissolution of Yugoslavia]], [[Yugoslav wars]], and the [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 757|UN-imposed sanctions]] left Podgorica's industries without traditional markets, suppliers, and available funds. This, combined with typical [[Transition economy|transition]] pressures, led to a decline of the industrial base, where many industries collapsed leaving thousands of citizens unemployed. {{Citation needed|date=March 2017}} However, some of the industries, including [[Podgorica Aluminium Plant|Podgorica aluminium smelter]] and [[Planta\u017ee]], managed to survive the turmoil of the 1990s, and are still major contributors to Montenegrin export and industrial output to this day.\n\nAs Montenegro began its push for independence from Serbia in the late 1990s, Podgorica greatly benefited from increased concentration of government and service sectors. {{Citation needed|date=March 2017}} In addition to almost the entire country's government, Podgorica is home to the [[Montenegro Stock Exchange]] and other major Montenegrin financial institutions, along with telecommunications carriers, media outlets, [[Montenegro Airlines|Montenegrin flag carrier airline]], and other significant institutions and companies.\n\nThe large presence of government and service sectors spared the economy of Podgorica from prolonged stagnation in the [[Great Recession|late 2000s recession]], which hit Montenegro hard. Although, in mid-2014, some 30% of Montenegro's citizens lived in Podgorica, the municipality accounted for 44% of the country's employed. Out of the entire mass of paid nwt salaries in Montenegro in that year, some 47% was paid in Podgorica. The average monthly net salary in May, 2014 was \u20ac509 in Podgorica municipality.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.monstat.org/userfiles/file/publikacije/2014/6/zaposlenost%20i%20zarade.pdf |title=Monthly Statistical Review, no. 6/2014 |format=pdf|publisher=Monstat |date=2014-05-05 |accessdate=2014-10-13}}</ref>\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Capital Plaza of Podgorica Trg Svetog Petra Cetinjskog IMG 1291 Ulitsa Dr Ljubomira Ra\u0161ovi\u0107a.jpg|The Capital Plaza\nFile:Telenor.JPG|Telenor Center\nFile:DeltaPG.JPG|Delta City\nFile:PC Kru\u0161evac.JPG|TC Kru\u0161evac\n</gallery>\n\n==Demographics==\n{{Further|Demographics of Podgorica}}\n{{Historical populations\n|type =\n|1948|14369 |1953|19868 |1961|35054 |1971|61727 |1981|96074 |1991|117875 |2003|136473 |2011|150977 |2018|199715\n|\n}}\n\nAlthough medium-sized by European standards, Podgorica is by far the largest city in [[Montenegro]]: almost one third of Montenegrin citizens live there.

The average age of the population is 35.7. [[Serbian language|Serbian]] is the most spoken language, with 42.4% of Podgorica citizens declaring it as their first language. It is followed closely by [[Montenegrin language|Montenegrin]], at 41.17%. Other significant languages spoken in Podgorica are [[Albanian language|Albanian]] (5.53%) and [[Romani language|Romani]] (1.81%).\n\nThe majority of Podgorica citizens are [[Orthodox Christians]] (78.27%), while there are significant minorities of [[Muslims]] (11.23%) and [[Catholic Church|Catholics]] (4.27%).\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! width=\"100\" | Nationality (2011 census)\n! width=\"80\" | Number\n! width=\"80\" | Percentage\n|-\n| [[Montenegrins]] || 106,642 || 57.35%\n|-\n| [[Serbs]] || 43,248 || 23.26%\n|-\n| [[Albanians]] || 9,538 || 5.13%\n|-\n| [[Muslims by nationality|Muslims]] || 4,122 || 2.22%\n|-\n| [[Bosniaks]] || 3,687\t || 1,98%\n|-\n| [[Romani people|Romani]] || 3,988 || 2.14%\n|-\n| others || 5,820 || 3.13%\n|-\n| undeclared || 8,892 || 4.78%'''\n|}\n\n==Religion==\n[[File:Podgorica, cattedrale della resurrezione di cristo, esterno 01.JPG|thumb|right|200px|[[Cathedral of the Resurrection of Christ, Podgorica|Cathedral of Podgorica]].]]\n[[File:Manastir Dajbabe - panoramio (2).jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Dajbabe Monastery]].]]\n\nPodgorica is home to three main religious groups: [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christians]], [[Sunni Islam|Sunni Muslims]] and [[Catholicism|Catholic Christians]].\n\nOrthodox Christian population mostly originates from the local [[Montenegrins (ethnic group)|Montenegrin]] and [[Serb]] population, which accepted [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christianity]] in Middle Ages after a major split during [[East\u2013West Schism|The Great Schism]]. They represent the major religious group. There are various Eastern Orthodox churches in the City such as St. George Church which originates from the 13th century, or [[Cathedral of the Resurrection of Christ (Podgorica)|Cathedral of the Resurrection of Christ]] which is the largest church in the city to have been recently erected.\nThe [[Muslims|Muslim]] population mostly originates from local [[Bosniaks]], as well as [[Albanians]].\n\nThere are several mosques in Podgorica and [[Tuzi]]. Catholic population mainly consists of local Albanian minority. The main religious site for the Catholic population located in the [[Konik, Montenegro|Konik neighbourhood]] is the [[Church of the Holy Heart of Jesus (Podgorica)|Church of the Holy Heart of Jesus]] constructed in 1966, in [[Brutalist architecture|Brutalist]] style which makes this object unique.

The city assembly has 59 members, elected directly for four-year terms. The mayor used to be directly elected for five-year term, but since the new law was introduced in Montenegrin municipalities mayors will be elected by the city assembly and will have to maintain its support during his term. Separate elections are held for the local sub-division of [[Golubovci]] since it is part of their administrative autonomy inside Podgorica municipality. Constant questions are raised by various politicians over gaining separate municipality status for [[Golubovci]]. In 2018, [[Tuzi Municipality|Tuzi]] became its own municipality after a vote on the Montenegrin Parliament.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdm.me/english/tuzi-will-become-independent-municipality/|title=Tuzi became its own Municipality.}}</ref>\n\nOn local elections held on 25 May 2014, the [[Democratic Party of Socialists]] won 29 seats in the municipal assembly, one short of 30 needed to form a majority.

After lengthy negotiations, SDP dissolved coalition with Pozitivna, and made arrangement on forming majority with DPS, similar to one they have in national government. While SDP is longtime partner of DPS at national level, it has been in opposition in Podgorica municipal assembly in 2010-2014 period. \nSince October 2014, position of the mayor is held by [[Democratic Party of Socialists|DPS]] official, Slavoljub Stijepovi\u0107, replacing Podgorica mayor od 14 years, [[Miomir Mugo\u0161a]].\n\n===City Assembly===\n{{see|Podgorica City Assembly election, 2018}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:left;\"\n!colspan=2|Party/Coalition\n!Seats\n!Local government\n|-\n! style=\"background-color: #F6931D\" |\n| [[Democratic Party of Socialists of Montenegro|Democratic Party of Socialists]] \n| {{Composition bar|32|60|hex=#F6931D}}\n| {{yes|Government}}\n|-\n! style=\"background-color: red\" |\n| [[Democratic Montenegro]] \n| {{Composition bar|12|60|hex=#FF0000}}\n| {{no|Opposition}}\n|-\n! style=\"background-color: darkred\" |\n| [[United Reform Action]]\n| {{Composition bar|5|60|hex=darkred}}\n| {{no|Opposition}}\n|-\n! style=\"background-color: darkblue\" |\n| [[Democratic Front (Montenegro)|Democratic Front]] \n| {{Composition bar|5|60|hex=darkblue}}\n| {{no|Opposition}}\n|-\n! style=\"background-color: cornflowerblue\" |\n| [[Socialist People's Party of Montenegro|Socialist People's Party]]\n| {{Composition bar|3|60|hex=cornflowerblue}}\n| {{no|Opposition}}\n|-\n! style=\"background-color: #fd00ff\" |\n| [[Social Democrats of Montenegro|Social Democrats]] \n| {{Composition bar|3|60|hex=#fd00ff}}\n| {{yes|Government}}\n|-\n! style=\"background-color: blue\" |\n| [[Albanian Alternative]]\n| {{Composition bar|1|60|hex=blue}}\n| {{no|Opposition}}\n|}\n\n===Local subdivisions===\n{{Main|Subdivisions of Podgorica}}\n\nThe municipality of Podgorica consists of ''Podgorica City Proper'' and one subdivision (called ''[[city municipality]],'' \u0433\u0440\u0430\u0434\u0441\u043a\u0435 \u043e\u043f\u0448\u0442\u0438\u043d\u0435, ''gradske op\u0161tine''), which is [[Golubovci]].\n\nThe entire municipality of Podgorica is further divided into 57 ''[[local community|local communities]]'' (\u043c\u0458\u0435\u0441\u043d\u0435 \u0437\u0430\u0458\u0435\u0434\u043d\u0438\u0446\u0435, ''mjesne zajednice''), bodies in which the citizens participate in decisions on matters of relevance to the local community.\n\n==Education==\n\nMost of Montenegro's higher education establishments are in Podgorica. It is home to the [[University of Montenegro]], the country's most significant such institution. The following faculties are in Podgorica:\n{{col-start}}\n{{col-2}}\n* [[University of Montenegro Faculty of Economics|Faculty of Economics]]\n* [[University of Montenegro Faculty of Law|Faculty of Law]]\n* [[University of Montenegro Faculty of Electrical Engineering|Faculty of Electrical Engineering]]\n* [[University of Montenegro Faculty of Metallurgy and Technology|Faculty of Metallurgy and Technology]]\n* [[University of Montenegro Faculty of Political Sciences|Faculty of Political Sciences]]\n* Faculty of [[Civil Engineering]]\n{{col-2}}\n* Faculty of [[Mechanical Engineering]]\n* Faculty of [[Natural Sciences]] and [[Mathematics]]\n* [[University of Montenegro Faculty of Medicine|Faculty of Medicine]]\n* [[University of Montenegro Faculty of Pharmacy|Faculty of Pharmacy]]\n* [[University of Montenegro Faculty of Architecture|Faculty of Architecture]]\n* [[University of Montenegro Faculty of Biotechnology|Faculty of Biotechnology]]\n{{col-2}}\n{{col-end}}\n\nThe university's scientific research institutes are in the city:\n* Institute of Foreign Languages\n* Institute of Biotechnology\n* Institute of History\n\nThe [[Montenegrin Academy of Sciences and Arts]] is in Podgorica, as is the [[Doclean Academy of Sciences and Arts|DANU]] cultural organization.\n\nThe [[Mediterranean University]] was founded 2006 as first private university in Montenegro. In the meantime, the number of private institutions for higher education has increased, like [[University of Donja Gorica|UDG - University of Donja Gorica]]. The municipality of Podgorica has 34 elementary schools and 10 secondary schools, including one [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]]. The first secondary school established in Podgorica is [[Gymnasium \"Slobodan \u0160kerovi\u0107\"]]. The rebuilt economic high school offers new features and higher quality education. The Radosav Ljumovi\u0107 National Library is considered the most comprehensive in Montenegro.\n\n==Transport==\n\n===Public transport===\n[[File:PGWelcome.jpg|thumb|left|Northern entrance to Podgorica ([[European route E65|E65]], [[European route E80|E80]]).]]\n[[File:Millennium Bridge in Podgorica, Montenegro 02.jpg|thumb|left|[[Millennium Bridge (Montenegro)|Millennium Bridge]].]]\nPublic transport in Podgorica consists of 11 urban and 16 suburban bus lines.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.podgorica.me/%C5%BDivotuPodgorici/Saobra%C4%87aj/tabid/129/language/sr-Latn-CS/Default.aspx |title=Saobra\u0107aj |publisher=Podgorica.me |accessdate=2013-03-12 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130325043642/http://www.podgorica.me/%C5%BDivotuPodgorici/Saobra%C4%87aj/tabid/129/language/sr-Latn-CS/Default.aspx |archivedate=25 March 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The city-owned ''AD Gradski saobra\u0107aj'' public transport company used to be the sole bus operator until the 1990s, when private carriers were introduced. The company went bankrupt in 2001, and buses were since operated solely by private carriers.\n\nPublic transport faces competition from very popular dispatched taxi services. De-regulation and stiff competition has made taxi services very affordable. {{Citation needed|date=August 2017}} Over 20 taxi companies are operating in Podgorica with close to 800 vehicles in service. {{citation needed|date=December 2017}} Usually, taxi companies provide a high level of service, with relatively new and uniform car fleets and [[GPS]]-tracked vehicles.\n\n===Roads===\n[[File:Sozina-Tunnel.png|thumb|350px|[[Sozina Tunnel]] shortens the journey from Podgorica to Montenegro's main port [[Bar, Montenegro|Bar]], by some 25 km.]]\nPodgorica's location in central Montenegro makes it a natural hub for rail and road transport. Roads in Montenegro (especially those connecting Podgorica to northern Montenegro and [[Serbia]]) are usually inferior to modern European roads. Both major Montenegrin motorway projects, [[A-1 motorway (Montenegro)|Bar-Boljare motorway]] and [[Adriatic\u2013Ionian motorway#Montenegro|Nudo\u2013Bo\u017eaj motorway]], will pass near Podgorica. The newly built [[Sozina tunnel]] (4.2&nbsp;km) shortened the journey from Podgorica to [[Bar, Montenegro|Bar]] (Montenegro's main seaport) to under 30 minutes. Also a new road bypass has been constructed in 2011, to remove transport routes from north to south of the country, out of the city centre. A south-western bypass has also been planned {{citation needed|date=August 2017}}, with same goal of moving heavy transport out of the city core. Podgorica is also characteristic for its extensive network of multi-lane boulevards which make inner city transport quick and effective. Traffic over the [[Mora\u010da River]] also goes fluently since river banks are very well connected with 6 vehicular and 3 pedestrian bridges.\n\nThe current main transit connections of Podgorica are:\n* north ([[European route E65|E65]], [[European route E80|E80]]), towards [[Belgrade]] and on to Central Europe\n* west ([[European route E762|E762]]), towards [[Nik\u0161i\u0107]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia]] and on to Western Europe\n* south ([[European route E65|E65]], [[European route E80|E80]]) towards the [[Adriatic coast]]\n* east ([[European route E762|E762]]), towards [[Albania]]\n\n===Rail===\n[[File:01.10.13 Podgorica 6111.101 & 461.040 (10101220063).jpg|thumb|[[Podgorica Rail Station]].]]\nPodgorica is a hub of the X-shaped [[Railways of Montenegro|Montenegrin rail network]]. The [[Belgrade\u2013Bar railway|Belgrade\u2013Bar]] line converges with the [[Nik\u0161i\u0107-Podgorica railway|line to Nik\u0161i\u0107]] and [[Podgorica\u2013Shkod\u00ebr railway|line to Shkod\u00ebr]] at the [[Podgorica Rail Station]]. The station itself is located {{convert|1.5|km|2|abbr=on}} to the southeast of the main city square. Podgorica's main railway link (for both passenger and freight traffic) is Belgrade\u2013Bar.  The link to [[Nik\u0161i\u0107]] was recently under reconstruction ([[Railway electrification system|electrification]]);<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.montenegroberza.com/code/navigate.asp?Id=718|title=U \u017deljeznicu ula\u017eu 52 miliona eura}}</ref> afterwards, passenger service started in October 2012. The rail link to [[Shkod\u00ebr]] is currently used as freight-only.\n\n===Air===\n[[File:Podgorica airport.jpg|thumb|[[Podgorica Airport]] near [[Golubovci]].]]\n[[Podgorica Airport]] is located in [[Zeta Plain]], {{convert|11|km|mi|abbr=on}} south of Podgorica City centre, and is Montenegro's main international airport. The airport is locally known as Golubovci Airport (\u0410\u0435\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0440\u043e\u043c \u0413\u043e\u043b\u0443\u0431\u043e\u0432\u0446\u0438 / Aerodrom Golubovci), as it is located within the administrative boundaries of the town of [[Golubovci]]. The IATA code of the airport is still TGD because Podgorica was named Titograd, during which time the airport opened. It is the main hub for [[Montenegro Airlines]] and [[Di Air]].\n\n==International relations==\n{{See also|List of twin towns and sister cities in Montenegro}}\n\n===Twin towns and sister cities===\nPodgorica is [[Twin towns and sister cities|twinned]] with:\n*{{flagicon|NMK}} [[Skopje]], North Macedonia<ref name=\"Skopje twinnings\">{{cite web|url=http://www.skopje.gov.mk/EN/DesktopDefault.aspx?tabindex=0&tabid=69|title=Official portal of City of Skopje \u2013 Skopje Sister Cities|publisher=2006\u20132009 [http://www.skopje.gov.mk/DesktopDefault.aspx?tabindex=0&tabid=1 City of Skopje]|accessdate=2009-07-14}}</ref>\n\n===Partner cities===\n*{{flagicon|ARM}} [[Yerevan]], Armenia<ref name=\"Yerevan partnerships\">{{cite web|url=http://www.yerevan.am/3-233-233.html|title=Yerevan - Partner Cities|accessdate=2013-11-04|work=Yerevan Municipality Official Website|publisher=\u00a9 2005\u20142013 www.yerevan.am|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131105220142/http://www.yerevan.am/3-233-233.html|archivedate=5 November 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n== Notable people ==\n\nBelow are some of the most notable people who were either born, or spent most of their lives in Podgorica:\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n*[[Bo\u017eidar Vukovi\u0107]], one of the first printers among the [[South Slavs]]\n*[[Bla\u017eo Jovanovi\u0107]], first [[President of Montenegro|President of the People's Assembly]] of [[Montenegro]]\n*[[Dejan Savi\u0107evi\u0107]], football player, [[1990\u201391 European Cup|European Cup]] champion\n*[[Predrag Mijatovi\u0107]], football player\n*[[Stevan Joveti\u0107]], football player\n*[[Du\u0161ko Vujo\u0161evi\u0107]], Montenegrin basketball coach\n*[[Marko Miljanov]], general, clan chief and writer\n*[[Vojo Stani\u0107]], sculptor and painter\n*[[Risto Stijovi\u0107]], sculptor and painter\n*[[Borislav Peki\u0107]], novelist\n*[[Nikola Radovi\u0107]], football player, Olympic silver medalist\n*[[Zoran Filipovi\u0107]] football player and coach\n*[[Du\u0161ko Radinovi\u0107]], football player\n*[[Simon Vuk\u010devi\u0107]], football player\n*[[Refik \u0160abanad\u017eovi\u0107]] football player\n*[[Dejan Zlati\u010danin]], boxer, lightweight [[World Boxing Council|WBC]] champion\n*[[Dejan Radonji\u0107]], basketball player and coach\n*[[Nikola Bulatovi\u0107]], basketball player\n*[[Ljiljana Mugo\u0161a]], handball player, Olympic champion\n*[[Svetlana Mugo\u0161a-Anti\u0107]], handball player, Olympic champion\n*[[Nikola Miroti\u0107]], Spanish basketball player, Olympic bronze medalist and European champion\n*[[Ivan Strugar]], kick-boxer\n*[[An\u0111ela Bulatovi\u0107]], handball player, Olympic silver medalist and European champion\n*[[Jovanka Radi\u010devi\u0107]], handball player, Olympic silver medalist and European champion\n*[[Knez (singer)|Nenad Kne\u017eevi\u0107 \"Knez\"]], pop singer\n*[[Sergej \u0106etkovi\u0107]], pop singer\n{{div col end}}\n\n===Honorary citizens===\n\n*{{flagicon|CRO}} [[Stjepan Mesi\u0107]], former [[List of Presidents of Croatia|President of Croatia]].\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery>\nFile:Podgorica City Hall Independence Day Montenegro.jpg|Podgorica City Hall on Independence Day\nFile:Podgorica Trg Republike.JPG|[[Independence Square (Podgorica)|Independence Square]]\nFile:Vaso Brajovic.jpg|Monument to General [[Vaso Brajovi\u0107]]\nFile:Marko Miljanov - spomenik u Podgorici.jpg|Monument to [[Marko Miljanov]]\nFile:Josip Broz Tito Podgorica.jpg|Monument to [[Josip Broz Tito]]\nFile:Moskovska.jpg|Moscow street, Preko Mora\u010de neighbourhood\nFile:Pet udovica - panoramio.jpg|Momi\u0161i\u0107i neighbourhood\nFile:Natural History Museum of Montenegro, Sahat Kula, 2019.jpg|Natural History Museum and Clock Tower in the Old Town\n</gallery>\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Sources==\n* {{cite book | ref = harv | url = http://www.cpi.hr/download/links/7292.pdf | chapter = Antibirokratska revolucija 1987-1989. godine | language = Serbian | first = Olivera | last = Milosavljevi\u0107 | format = PDF | title = Dijalog povjesni\u010dara - istori\u010dara 8, Zadar | editor-last1 = Graovac | editor-first1 = Igor | editor-last2 = Fleck | editor-first2 = Hans-Georg | publisher = Political Science Research Centre Ltd.
