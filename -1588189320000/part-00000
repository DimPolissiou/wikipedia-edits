The show had previously gone under several other names, including ''Festival of British Popular Songs'' (1957), ''Eurovision Song Contest British Final'' (1959\u20131960), ''The Great British Song Contest'' (1996\u20131999), ''Eurovision: Making Your Mind Up'' (2004\u20132007), ''Eurovision: Your Decision'' (2008), and ''Eurovision: Your Country Needs You'' (2009\u20132010), but was known, for most of its history, as '''''A Song for Europe''''' (1961\u20131995, 2000\u20132003).\n\nThe selection process, originally broadcast on [[BBC One]], has varied between selecting both the performer and song, or just the song in some years. For most years the public has been able to vote for the winner, in the past with postcard voting, where the viewers sent postcards with their vote to the BBC, but more recently televoting and online. In 2009 and 2010, the singer was chosen by a public vote and the song internally selected.\n\nThe most recent name and format was adopted in 2016, as between 2011 and 2015 the UK representation had been selected internally by the BBC, resulting in the televised selection show being suspended. On 30 September 2015, the BBC confirmed the show would return in 2016 and on 17 January 2016 that the national selection show would return and be called ''Eurovision: You Decide'' and broadcast on [[BBC Four]].<ref name=\"Revival\">{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-34391365|title=Public to help choose UK Eurovision entry \u2013 BBC News|work=[[BBC News Online]]|date=30 September 2015|accessdate=30 September 2015}}</ref>\n\nOn 9 December 2016, it was confirmed that ''Eurovision: You Decide'' would return on 27 January 2017 and aired on [[BBC Two]].<ref name=\"2017Selection\">{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/latestnews/2016/eurovision-you-decide-show|title=The spotlight's on, the stage is set \u2013 Eurovision: You Decide is back|work=BBC Media Centre|date=9 December 2016|accessdate=9 December 2016}}</ref> The format returned in 2018 and 2019, again broadcast live on BBC Two.

The ''You Decide'' format was scrapped in September 2019 and an internal selection is to be used for the UK's 2020 participation, with [[BBC Studios]] and music company [[BMG Rights Management|BMG]] collaborating in order to find the entry which will then be released and published by BMG.<ref name=\"2020 Internal\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-49715308|title=BBC drops Eurovision selection public vote|date=16 September 2019|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/latestnews/2019/eurovision|title=BBC - United Kingdom confirmed for Eurovision 2020 - Media Centre|website=www.bbc.co.uk|access-date=16 September 2019}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n\n===Early days===\nThe format of the show and the manner in which the winner is chosen has gone through many mutations. In its early days, there was a round of televised semi-finals, with the winner chosen by regional juries situated across the country. This format was used until 1960. During this era the show was known as the \"Festival Of British Popular Songs\" (1957) and \"Eurovision Song Contest British Finals\" (1959 & 1960). In 1961 the show became known by its more familiar title, \"A Song For Europe\", with regional juries once more deciding the winner. Typically, during that period, singers would be invited by the [[BBC]] to choose and perform a song that they liked from the shortlist available. Household names such as [[Petula Clark]], [[Lita Roza]], [[Anne Shelton (singer)|Anne Shelton]], [[Frank Ifield]], [[Ronnie Hilton]] and [[David Hughes (tenor)|David Hughes]] were amongst the contenders for the UK competition, none of whom were able to secure the much cherished ticket to the Eurovision final. In the early 1960s, record companies became involved in the selection process for the first time and submitted songs by their artists. This produced hits for [[Craig Douglas]], [[Karl Denver]], [[Jackie Lee (Irish singer)|Jackie Lee]], [[Kenny Lynch]], [[Vince Hill]] and [[Ricky Valance]], but again, none of them were selected to go forward to the Eurovision Song Contest final itself.\n\nFrom 1964 up until 1975, an artist would be chosen by the BBC, and that artist would sing all six songs (five in 1966 and 1967) in the selection, and the public (bar 1964 and 1971) would choose by postcard which song they would like to represent them in the contest. Regional juries selected the winner in 1964. A postal strike in 1971 prevented the ballot from taking place, so regional juries were once again constructed to pick the winner. In 1972, national power cuts meant that the broadcast of the show was blacked out in many areas, leading to a much lower postal vote. In its early days of this format, only \"light entertainment\" singers were used, such as [[Kenneth McKellar (singer)|Kenneth McKellar]] and [[Kathy Kirby]]. However, the poor showing of McKellar in Luxembourg (he placed 9th of 18 entries with scores from only 2 countries, including top marks from Ireland) prompted the BBC to use more mainstream pop stars, which led to a run of successful results for the UK. This idea was dropped due to the low number of postal votes cast in the contest of 1975, in which all six songs were performed by [[The Shadows]], and after objections from songwriters who felt [[The Shadows]], and the [[BBC]]'s selections in general, were not the sort of artists they wanted to represent their music.\n\nAfter 1964, the \"Song For Europe\" selection process was incorporated into other [[BBC]] light entertainment shows, in addition to the songs being broadcast on BBC Radio programmes. Typically, the performer would sing one song a week either on their own series or as a guest on another regular [[BBC]] TV show, more often than not, televised on Saturdays. This culminated with the performer singing all the songs one after another in a special edition of the given show. From 1968 to 1975, these performances were then immediately repeated before viewers were asked to cast their votes by mail. The following week, the winning song would be announced and performed once more, although there was a two-week wait in 1965. In 1968, [[Cliff Richard]] performed the songs only in a special edition of [[Cilla Black]]'s eponymous TV series (broadcast on Tuesdays), without having sung them weekly beforehand. The various shows chosen for the \"Song For Europe\" performances were ''[[Kathy Kirby#The Kathy Kirby Show - Series 1|The Kathy Kirby Show]]'' (1965 shown on Fridays), ''Kenneth McKellar's A Song For Everyone'' (1966 shown on Thursdays), ''The Rolf Harris Show'' (1967), ''[[Cilla (TV series)|Cilla]]'' ([[Cilla (TV series)#Series 1 .281968.29|1968]] and [[Cilla (TV series)#Series 6 .281972.E2.80.9373.29|1973]]), ''[[Lulu (singer)#Lulu.E2.80.99s Back In Town|Lulu]]'' ([[Lulu (singer)#Lulu .28Series 1.29|1969]] and [[Lulu (singer)#Lulu .28Series 2.29|1975]]), ''[[List of Cliff Richard television appearances|It's Cliff Richard!]]'' ([[List of Cliff Richard television appearances#It.27s Cliff Richard: Series 1|1970]], [[List of Cliff Richard television appearances#It.27s Cliff Richard: Series 2|1971]] and [[List of Cliff Richard television appearances#It.27s Cliff Richard: Series 3|1972]]) and ''[[Jimmy Savile#Television|Clunk, Click... As It Happens]]'' (1974) \u2013 when in a break with the format, [[Olivia Newton-John]] performed three songs a week for two weeks rather than one a week for six weeks. Originally, [[Cilla (TV series)#Series 7 (1974)|Cilla Black's 1974 nine-part BBC series]] was also scheduled to feature the 'Song for Europe' process, but Black was uncomfortable at promoting another female singer (Newton-John) each week throughout the series' run and in a rather last minute decision, the BBC arranged to move the process to another show, necessitating the contracted process.<ref>Wincentsen, Edward. 'The Olivia Newton-John Companion'. Wynn Publishing 2002. {{ISBN|978-0-9710591-0-8}}</ref>\n\nThis period was highly successful for the UK in the Eurovision Song Contest. Author and historian [[John Kennedy O'Connor]] notes in his book ''The Eurovision Song Contest \u2013 The Official History'', that every UK entry to the contest from 1967 to 1977 finished in the top four, with only three songs not being first or second.<ref name=JohnKennedy>O'Connor, John Kennedy. The Eurovision Song Contest \u2013 The Official History. Carlton Books, UK. 2007 {{ISBN|978-1-84442-994-3}}</ref> Indeed, the UK were only 7 points short of four consecutive victories from 1967 to 1970.\n\n===1970s and 1980s===\nIn 1976, the method used from 1961 - 1963 was reinstated. Twelve songs were performed by artists chosen by the songwriters themselves and the winner was chosen by regional juries across the country during a stand-alone show called \"A Song For Europe\".  This system produced an immediate success by choosing the song which went on to be the Eurovision winner that year, \"Save Your Kisses for Me\" by [[Brotherhood of Man]]. The first few years of the revamped format also saw a plethora of well-known names take part in the competition. [[Frank Ifield]], [[Tammy Jones]], [[Sweet Sensation (band)|Sweet Sensation]], [[Lyn Paul]], [[Tony Monopoly]], [[Carl Wayne]], [[Hazell Dean]], [[Tony Christie]], [[The Foundations]], [[Labi Siffre]], [[Guys 'n' Dolls]], [[The Nolan Sisters]], [[Polly Brown]] and [[Sweet Dreams (1970s band)|Sweet Dreams]] all took part in the competition, but none were successful. Likewise, the first two winners of the contest, [[Brotherhood of Man]] and [[Lynsey de Paul]] & [[Mike Moran (music producer)|Mike Moran]], had many hits under their belts before attempting Eurovision.\n\nIn 1977, a strike by [[BBC]] cameramen led to the contest being blacked out on TV, although the show went ahead and the audio portion was later broadcast on BBC Radio 2. The TV programme has never been broadcast and is not listed in the [[BBC]] archives, yet it was transmitted to the various regional juries in [[BBC]] studios around the country, in order for them to cast their votes. The 1979 \"A Song For Europe\" final was never held at all, due to a strike by BBC sound engineers. The juries had to judge using audio recordings of the rehearsals. The songs were presented to the public on [[Terry Wogan]]'s radio show the following day, after the result was known, followed later in the day with a spot on the TV magazine show ''[[Nationwide (TV series)|Nationwide]]'', where the top 5 were revealed and the winners, [[Black Lace (band)|Black Lace]], were interviewed as guests on the show.  As a result of this industrial action, all future contests were staged at [[BBC]] studios and not as outside broadcasts from venues. The 1980 result ended in a tie between [[Prima Donna (band)|Prima Donna]]'s \"Love Enough For Two\" and [[Maggie Moone]]'s \"Happy Everything\". To resolve this, in an unrehearsed panic, host [[Terry Wogan]] called back the juries to announce their favourite of the two songs. This led to extreme confusion when the scoreboard failed to keep up and some juries contradicted the results they had given earlier. Prima Donna won, with eight juries to Maggie Moone's six. A detailed check of the votes after the show did confirm that Prima Donna were the correct winners. Prima Donna were the first winners of the competition specifically formed to take part in Eurovision. This became the norm in the 1980s and the artists taking part in the contest became more and more obscure and amateurish. However, a few notable acts did enter the contest in the 1980s, with scant success. [[Adrian Baker|Liquid Gold]], [[Alvin Stardust]], [[Sinitta]] and [[Hazell Dean]] all failed to come through the heats.\n\nBy 1981, the number of songs had dropped to eight, and interest had started to wane. Four out of eight songs in both the 1982 and 1984 events were written by [[Paul Curtis (musician)|Paul Curtis]], who was unsurprisingly responsible for the 1984 winner; \"Love Games\". Following [[Belle & The Devotions]]' performance at the 1984 Eurovision contest in Luxembourg, the audience audibly booed them from the stage in an orchestrated demonstration against the song's supposed plagiarism,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2ZmVXSPyAI |title=Kit Rolfe of Belle and the Devotions interview \u2013 Part 1 |publisher=YouTube |date=1984-07-17 |accessdate=2014-06-04}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzGixIxPSzY |title=Kit Rolfe of Belle and the Devotions interview \u2013 Part 2 |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=2014-06-04}}</ref> and by the local audience retaliating against a particularly shocking violent attack by English soccer fans.<ref>O'Connor, John Kennedy. The Eurovision Song Contest: The Official History. Carlton Books, UK, 2009. {{ISBN|978-1-84732-521-1}}</ref> For 1985, the [[BBC]] wanted to revert to having one singer of their choice perform all the short listed songs and approached [[Bonnie Tyler]] and when she was unavailable, [[Lena Zavaroni]] for the task. However, the Music Publisher's Association blocked the move, wanting their members the choice of their own singers to represent their music. A compromise was reached and only solo artists or duets \u2013 no \"made for Eurovision\" acts \u2013 were permitted to take part in the 1985 UK selection process and limited two entries per songwriter. Despite this rule, both songs submitted by Paul Curtis reached the final eight. They reverted to allowing all-comers for 1986. Starting in 1985, the songs were also 'previewed' on [[Terry Wogan]]'s prime time chat show on [[BBC One|BBC1]] ahead of the final. When the series ended in 1992, the songs were presented in 1993 and 1994 in stand-alone programmes, hosted by Terry.\n\nThe number of entries briefly increased to ten in 1987 when record companies were invited to submit songs, but after a poor result from [[Rikki (British singer)|Rikki]] in the Eurovision final of 1987, the regional juries were disbanded, and the final decision given to the public through telephone voting, with a celebrity panel offering comments on the entries intended to guide viewers. This proved to be a relative success, accruing two second places and a sixth place ([[Zagreb]], 1990). However, a disappointing 10th place in Rome obtained by [[Samantha Janus]] led the BBC to rethink the standard of performers in the competition.\n\n===1990s===\nAs a result of the disappointing results in 1990 & 1991, the system that was used between 1964 and 1975 was resurrected, with the [[BBC]]'s head of light entertainment, [[James Moir|Jim Moir]] choosing one artist to perform all the songs in the UK final. [[Michael Ball (singer)|Michael Ball]] was the first in 1992, and went on to win second place. [[Sonia (singer)|Sonia]] was also second the following year. However, after a suggestion by [[Don Black (lyricist)|Don Black]] to the [[BBC]]'s new head of light entertainment [[David Liddiment]] in 1994, [[Tony Award for Best Featured Actress in a Musical|Tony Award]] winning stage star [[Frances Ruffelle]] was offered the job of representing the UK. A virtually unknown singer, unsurprisingly, interest was low. Her final position in the Eurovision Song Contest held in Dublin was a disappointing tenth, the same achieved by [[Samantha Janus]] in 1991.\n\nA dramatic modernisation was introduced in 1995 in an attempt to boost the profile of the contest. Pop supremo [[Jonathan King]] was drafted in as Executive Producer to make the event more modern. The 1995 event had a diverse range of songs and some relatively well-known acts performing, such as [[Londonbeat]] who had a hit with \"[[I've Been Thinking About You]]\", pop-combo [[Deuce (band)|Deuce]] and [[Samantha Fox|Sox]], which featured singer and former Page 3 icon [[Samantha Fox]]. All songs were presented on a special edition of ''[[Top Of The Pops]]'' prior to the live final. On the night, the well-known artists were all beaten by rap act [[Love City Groove]], whose eponymous song could only manage a disappointing tenth in Dublin that year. On a positive note, the songs by [[Love City Groove]] and [[Deuce (band)|Deuce]] (\"I Need You\") made the top 10 in the UK singles charts, reaching #7 and #10 respectively, while three other entries \u2013 Dear Jon \"One Gift of Love\" at #68, [[Londonbeat]] \"I'm Just Your Puppet On A... (String!)\" at #55 and [[Samantha Fox|Sox]] \"Go For The Heart\" at #47 \u2013  all reached the UK top 100.\n\nIn 1996, a semi-final was introduced. All eight songs were performed on ''[[Top of the Pops]]'' on 1 March, and the public voted to decide the four finalists. The results were announced the following day, but there was no information given on who finished where. On 8 March the final was held, with [[Gina G]] winning very easily with her dance number \"[[Ooh Aah... Just A Little Bit]]\". The song became an instant hit in the charts, reaching Number 1 on the UK Singles Chart. It was the first UK non-winner to do so since 1968 but it was not as successful in the Eurovision Contest itself. In [[Oslo]], Gina could only manage eighth place, but was perhaps consoled by her Europe-wide hit with the song, which also became one of the few Eurovision songs, and one of the relatively few dance songs, to be a major hit in the United States where it peaked at #12 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], was #1 on their Dance Chart and earned a [[Grammy Award for Best Dance Recording|Grammy nomination]] for Best Dance Recording.\n\nJonathan King resigned, certain that, if Gina G couldn't win, nothing he selected could, but the BBC persuaded him to stay in charge and he decided to retain the same formula again, but with an added twist. All eight contestants would be heard on [[Ken Bruce]]'s radio show on [[BBC Radio 2]], with a public vote to decide the four finalists. The four would perform on ''[[The National Lottery Live]]'' until 1998, and then on ''[[Top of the Pops]]'' in 1999. The final itself would just consist of repeats of the performances made in the above shows, in a special programme on a Sunday afternoon. Jonathan persuaded his friends Katrina and [[Kimberley Rew]], who had hit with \"[[Walking on Sunshine (Katrina and the Waves song)|Walking On Sunshine]]\", to enter a new track, \"[[Love Shine A Light]]\". This produced a win in the Eurovision Contest itself for the United Kingdom and for [[Katrina and the Waves]] in 1997, and followed with a second place for [[Imaani]] in 1998, but disappointment in 1999 for the [[all-female band]] [[Precious (band)|Precious]].\n\n===2000s===\nIn 2000, the same format continued, but the final four songs were performed live in ''A Song For Europe'', still shunted to a graveyard Sunday afternoon slot. The result proved disappointing. [[Nicki French]] gave what author [[John Kennedy O'Connor]] describes in his book '''''The Eurovision Song Contest \u2013 The Official History''''' as a far from strong performance, despite her previous chart success and attained the UK's worst ever placing at the time, a mere 16th in Stockholm with \"[[Don't Play That Song Again]]\".<ref name=JohnKennedy/> This format continued the following year, and another poor showing for the UK. [[Lindsay Dracass|Lindsay D]] only got one place higher in Copenhagen. The entries from Six Chix in 2000 and Luke Galliana, the latter of which didn't make the 2001 final, became minor hits, with Galliana just failing to make the Top 40, but becoming a popular hit on cable request line music channel [[The Box (UK TV channel)|The Box]].\n\nThe 2002 ''A Song For Europe'' generated a lot of publicity, because three of the four acts that made the final were relatively well known to TV viewers, albeit not necessarily for their singing ability. Surf 'n' Turf included [[Jonathan Maitland]] who is a TV presenter of consumer advice shows such as ''[[Watchdog (TV series)|Watchdog]]'' and ''[[House of Horrors]]''. [[Tricia Penrose]] is an actress who plays Gina in the 60s retro drama ''[[Heartbeat (UK TV series)|Heartbeat]]'' on [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]], and [[Jessica Garlick]] had made the final stages of another ITV show ''[[Pop Idol]]''. The standard of songs was stronger than previous years, and Jessica Garlick had a runaway victory of nearly 70,000 votes with her ballad \"[[Come Back (Jessica Garlick song)|Come Back]]\". The song was also a success in Eurovision with it finishing joint third with host country [[Estonia]].\n\n2003 saw terrible disappointment. The new voting system of regional televoting, where 9, 10 and 12 points were awarded to the top three songs, led to an unsuccessful winner. [[Jemini]]'s \"[[Cry Baby (Jemini song)|Cry Baby]]\" won by four points over \"Help Me\" by Emily Reed. Confidence in the UK entry was low for both fans and the public, and in the actual contest held in Riga, Jemini picked up the UK's worst-ever showing, scoring \"nul points\" and finishing last, due to a very poor performance, although some reports attempted to blame European disapproval of the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|US-UK invasion of Iraq]] for the failure of any nation to give the UK even one point. As noted by author and historian [[John Kennedy O'Connor]], with 26 entries in the Eurovision field, this made \"Cry Baby\" the least successful song in the entire history of the contest.<ref name=JohnKennedy/> No song in the Eurovision final scored \"nul points\" again until 2015.\n\n[[File:Eurovision mymu.jpg|thumb|right|Logo from 2004 to 2006]]\nThe 2004 selection was totally different. Gone was the ''Song For Europe'' name, replaced with ''Making Your Mind Up''. The radio semi-final was also gone, and the six songs were performed live in a Saturday night show. This raised the profile of the competition, although there was criticism of the fact that four of the six acts were from reality TV shows. The winner, chosen by 70% regional televoting (regions awarding 0,2,4,6,8 and 12 points) and 30% SMS and Interactive voting, was [[James Fox (singer)|James Fox]], who had finished fifth in the second series of ''[[Fame Academy]]'', with a gentle ballad \"Hold On To Our Love\", written by Gary Miller and Tim Woodcock. Viewing figures were peaked at over 7 million for the results show.  The song finished 16th at the contest in [[Istanbul]].\n\nFor 2005, six songs dropped to five, and the show was moved to an early Saturday evening slot on 5 March, to avoid a clash with ''[[Fame Academy|Comic Relief Does Fame Academy]]''; and [[Natasha Kaplinsky]] replaced Gaby Roslin as co-host with Sir Terry Wogan.  The press focused on two performers. [[Javine Hylton]] who is a relatively well-known urban singer, and [[Jordan (Katie Price)|Katie Price]], aka Jordan, a famous glamour model.  The other contestants included former [[3SL]] bandmember [[Andy Scott-Lee]], the 1996 British Eurovision entry [[Gina G]] and unknown opera trio [[Tricolore (opera trio)|Tricolore]].  The voting itself was the same format as the previous year, but this time an online jury was added to decide between the contestants to take account of the views of those watching in the rest of Europe.  After an exciting voting sequence, Javine came out on top with her ethno-urban song \"[[Touch My Fire]]\", although she also caused some controversy when she briefly [[wardrobe malfunction|fell out of her top]] during an energetic dance routine.  At the 50th Eurovision Song Contest held in [[Kiev]], Javine finished 22nd out of 24 participants in the final, the UK's second poorest finish ever.\n\nIn February 2006 it was announced that artists competing in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2006|2006 contest]] would include [[Kym Marsh]] and [[Antony Costa]], both relatively well known in the UK for their past involvement with music bands (the former appearing in [[Hear'say]] and the latter in boy band [[Blue (boy band)|Blue]]). Following the format of the previous year (and with six songs this time), ''Making Your Mind Up'' returned in 2006 in a prime-time Saturday evening slot, and was broadcast on 4 March on [[BBC One]]. [[Terry Wogan]] and [[Natasha Kaplinsky]] once again presented and were accompanied by a 'Celebrity Jury' that included chat-show host [[Jonathan Ross (television presenter)|Jonathan Ross]], pop star [[Kelly Osbourne]] and ''[[Top of the Pops]]'' presenter [[Fearne Cotton]]. The eventual winner of the 2006 contest (after the 7 tele-juries from around the UK and mobile and web votes) was [[Daz Sampson]] and his song \"Teenage Life\". Yet another low result was produced for the United Kingdom, as Daz finished 19th in the contest out of 24 competing countries.\n\nDuring a press conference on 28 February 2007, the BBC confirmed that the artists taking part in ''Making Your Mind Up'' would include [[Big Brovaz]], an [[Rhythm and blues|RnB]] group who had 4 UK Top 10 singles in 2002\u20132003, [[Brian Harvey]], a former member of the boy band [[East 17]]; [[Cyndi Almouzni|Cyndi]]; [[Justin Hawkins]] of [[The Darkness (band)|The Darkness]], performing a duet with [[Beverlei Brown]]; [[Liz McClarnon]], formerly of [[girl group]] [[Atomic Kitten]]; and [[Scooch]], the eventual winners with \"[[Flying the Flag (for You)]]\". Scooch sang their entry in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2007]] on 12 May 2007 in [[Helsinki]], Finland and finished in second-to-last place with 19 points, ahead of Ireland who placed last.\n\nFor the first time, the show was filmed at [[The Maidstone Studios]] in [[Kent]]. The hour long final was broadcast at 7:30pm on 17 March 2007 on BBC One, with the half hour results show showing at 9:30pm on the same date. Although this was past the 12 March cut-off set by the EBU, the BBC were given a special extension because the EBU were made aware of this over a year in advance.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.esctoday.com/news/read/7829|title=Exclusive: UK Final on March 17th|publisher=ESCToday|author=Viniker, Barry|date=2007-02-28}}</ref>\n\nThe show ended in disarray when [[Fearne Cotton]] shouted out that the winner was Scooch, while co-host [[Terry Wogan]] simultaneously announced the winner to be Cyndi. After some confusion from both performers, each thinking the other had won, it was revealed that the true winner was Scooch.\n\nIn 2008 the show's name was changed to ''Eurovision: Your Decision''. It was screened in two parts in March 2008, and was hosted by [[Claudia Winkleman]] and Sir [[Terry Wogan]]. The six competing acts were paired as girl groups ([[LoveShy]] and [[The Revelations]]), soloists ([[Michelle Gayle]] and [[Andy Abraham]]), and \"Joseph and Maria\" contestants (Rob McVeigh and Simona Armstrong) from the BBC talent shows ''[[Any Dream Will Do (TV series)|Any Dream Will Do]]'' and ''[[How Do You Solve A Problem Like Maria?]]''. A panel of three judges ([[John Barrowman]], [[Carrie Grant]], and Terry Wogan) decided which artists to put through to a semi-final after each pair had performed. Terry Wogan then allowed one of the rejected acts through as a \"wild card\" before viewers were invited to vote by phone to decide which two would perform again in the final. The two finalists chosen by the viewers were Michelle Gayle singing \"[[Woo (You Make Me)]]\", and Andy Abraham singing \"[[Even If (Andy Abraham song)|Even If]]\". Despite having been originally eliminated at the first stage, Terry Wogan's \"wild card\" pick turned out to be the winner when the viewers voted Andy Abraham the victor with \"[[Even If (Andy Abraham song)|Even If]]\". This received a total of 14 points in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2008]] on 24 May 2008 in [[Belgrade]], finishing in last place, although sharing the same score with Poland (24th) and Germany (23rd).\n\n[[File:Eurovision YourCountryNeedsYou.jpg|thumb|left|[[Andrew Lloyd Webber]] in a promotional image for Your Country Needs You 2009]]\nThe [[BBC]] announced in a televised call for talent on 18 October 2008, that in 2009 there would be another change to the national final. The show was renamed ''Eurovision: Your Country Needs You'', hosted by [[Graham Norton]], and followed a format similar to popular BBC talent shows ''[[I'd Do Anything (2008 TV series)|I'd Do Anything]]'' and ''[[Any Dream Will Do (TV series)|Any Dream Will Do]]''. The multi-week format had members of the public (amateur or professional) compete to represent the UK at the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2009]], which was to be held in Moscow, Russia.

For most years the public has been able to vote for the winner, in the past with postcard voting, where the viewers sent postcards with their vote to the BBC, but more recently televoting and online. In 2009 and 2010, the singer was chosen by a public vote and the song internally selected.\n\nThe most recent name and format was adopted in 2016, as between 2011 and 2015 the UK representation had been selected internally by the BBC, resulting in the televised selection show being suspended. On 30 September 2015, the BBC confirmed the show would return in 2016 and on 17 January 2016 that the national selection show would return and be called ''Eurovision: You Decide'' and broadcast on [[BBC Four]].<ref name=\"Revival\">{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-34391365|title=Public to help choose UK Eurovision entry \u2013 BBC News|work=[[BBC News Online]]|date=30 September 2015|accessdate=30 September 2015}}</ref>\n\nOn 9 December 2016, it was confirmed that ''Eurovision: You Decide'' would return on 27 January 2017 and aired on [[BBC Two]].<ref name=\"2017Selection\">{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/latestnews/2016/eurovision-you-decide-show|title=The spotlight's on, the stage is set \u2013 Eurovision: You Decide is back|work=BBC Media Centre|date=9 December 2016|accessdate=9 December 2016}}</ref> The format returned in 2018 and 2019, again broadcast live on BBC Two.

In its early days, there was a round of televised semi-finals, with the winner chosen by regional juries situated across the country. This format was used until 1960. During this era the show was known as the \"Festival Of British Popular Songs\" (1957) and \"Eurovision Song Contest British Finals\" (1959 & 1960). In 1961 the show became known by its more familiar title, \"A Song For Europe\", with regional juries once more deciding the winner. Typically, during that period, singers would be invited by the [[BBC]] to choose and perform a song that they liked from the shortlist available. Household names such as [[Petula Clark]], [[Lita Roza]], [[Anne Shelton (singer)|Anne Shelton]], [[Frank Ifield]], [[Ronnie Hilton]] and [[David Hughes (tenor)|David Hughes]] were amongst the contenders for the UK competition, none of whom were able to secure the much cherished ticket to the Eurovision final. In the early 1960s, record companies became involved in the selection process for the first time and submitted songs by their artists. This produced hits for [[Craig Douglas]], [[Karl Denver]], [[Jackie Lee (Irish singer)|Jackie Lee]], [[Kenny Lynch]], [[Vince Hill]] and [[Ricky Valance]], but again, none of them were selected to go forward to the Eurovision Song Contest final itself.\n\nFrom 1964 up until 1975, an artist would be chosen by the BBC, and that artist would sing all six songs (five in 1966 and 1967) in the selection, and the public (bar 1964 and 1971) would choose by postcard which song they would like to represent them in the contest. Regional juries selected the winner in 1964. A postal strike in 1971 prevented the ballot from taking place, so regional juries were once again constructed to pick the winner. In 1972, national power cuts meant that the broadcast of the show was blacked out in many areas, leading to a much lower postal vote. In its early days of this format, only \"light entertainment\" singers were used, such as [[Kenneth McKellar (singer)|Kenneth McKellar]] and [[Kathy Kirby]]. However, the poor showing of McKellar in Luxembourg (he placed 9th of 18 entries with scores from only 2 countries, including top marks from Ireland) prompted the BBC to use more mainstream pop stars, which led to a run of successful results for the UK. This idea was dropped due to the low number of postal votes cast in the contest of 1975, in which all six songs were performed by [[The Shadows]], and after objections from songwriters who felt [[The Shadows]], and the [[BBC]]'s selections in general, were not the sort of artists they wanted to represent their music.\n\nAfter 1964, the \"Song For Europe\" selection process was incorporated into other [[BBC]] light entertainment shows, in addition to the songs being broadcast on BBC Radio programmes. Typically, the performer would sing one song a week either on their own series or as a guest on another regular [[BBC]] TV show, more often than not, televised on Saturdays. This culminated with the performer singing all the songs one after another in a special edition of the given show. From 1968 to 1975, these performances were then immediately repeated before viewers were asked to cast their votes by mail. The following week, the winning song would be announced and performed once more, although there was a two-week wait in 1965. In 1968, [[Cliff Richard]] performed the songs only in a special edition of [[Cilla Black]]'s eponymous TV series (broadcast on Tuesdays), without having sung them weekly beforehand. The various shows chosen for the \"Song For Europe\" performances were ''[[Kathy Kirby#The Kathy Kirby Show - Series 1|The Kathy Kirby Show]]'' (1965 shown on Fridays), ''Kenneth McKellar's A Song For Everyone'' (1966 shown on Thursdays), ''The Rolf Harris Show'' (1967), ''[[Cilla (TV series)|Cilla]]'' ([[Cilla (TV series)#Series 1 .281968.29|1968]] and [[Cilla (TV series)#Series 6 .281972.E2.80.9373.29|1973]]), ''[[Lulu (singer)#Lulu.E2.80.99s Back In Town|Lulu]]'' ([[Lulu (singer)#Lulu .28Series 1.29|1969]] and [[Lulu (singer)#Lulu .28Series 2.29|1975]]), ''[[List of Cliff Richard television appearances|It's Cliff Richard!]]'' ([[List of Cliff Richard television appearances#It.27s Cliff Richard: Series 1|1970]], [[List of Cliff Richard television appearances#It.27s Cliff Richard: Series 2|1971]] and [[List of Cliff Richard television appearances#It.27s Cliff Richard: Series 3|1972]]) and ''[[Jimmy Savile#Television|Clunk, Click... As It Happens]]'' (1974) \u2013 when in a break with the format, [[Olivia Newton-John]] performed three songs a week for two weeks rather than one a week for six weeks. Originally, [[Cilla (TV series)#Series 7 (1974)|Cilla Black's 1974 nine-part BBC series]] was also scheduled to feature the 'Song for Europe' process, but Black was uncomfortable at promoting another female singer (Newton-John) each week throughout the series' run and in a rather last minute decision, the BBC arranged to move the process to another show, necessitating the contracted process.<ref>Wincentsen, Edward.

Author and historian [[John Kennedy O'Connor]] notes in his book ''The Eurovision Song Contest \u2013 The Official History'', that every UK entry to the contest from 1967 to 1977 finished in the top four, with only three songs not being first or second.<ref name=JohnKennedy>O'Connor, John Kennedy. The Eurovision Song Contest \u2013 The Official History. Carlton Books, UK. 2007 {{ISBN|978-1-84442-994-3}}</ref> Indeed, the UK were only 7 points short of four consecutive victories from 1967 to 1970.\n\n===1970s and 1980s===\nIn 1976, the method used from 1961 - 1963 was reinstated. Twelve songs were performed by artists chosen by the songwriters themselves and the winner was chosen by regional juries across the country during a stand-alone show called \"A Song For Europe\".  This system produced an immediate success by choosing the song which went on to be the Eurovision winner that year, \"Save Your Kisses for Me\" by [[Brotherhood of Man]]. The first few years of the revamped format also saw a plethora of well-known names take part in the competition. [[Frank Ifield]], [[Tammy Jones]], [[Sweet Sensation (band)|Sweet Sensation]], [[Lyn Paul]], [[Tony Monopoly]], [[Carl Wayne]], [[Hazell Dean]], [[Tony Christie]], [[The Foundations]], [[Labi Siffre]], [[Guys 'n' Dolls]], [[The Nolan Sisters]], [[Polly Brown]] and [[Sweet Dreams (1970s band)|Sweet Dreams]] all took part in the competition, but none were successful. Likewise, the first two winners of the contest, [[Brotherhood of Man]] and [[Lynsey de Paul]] & [[Mike Moran (music producer)|Mike Moran]], had many hits under their belts before attempting Eurovision.\n\nIn 1977, a strike by [[BBC]] cameramen led to the contest being blacked out on TV, although the show went ahead and the audio portion was later broadcast on BBC Radio 2. The TV programme has never been broadcast and is not listed in the [[BBC]] archives, yet it was transmitted to the various regional juries in [[BBC]] studios around the country, in order for them to cast their votes. The 1979 \"A Song For Europe\" final was never held at all, due to a strike by BBC sound engineers. The juries had to judge using audio recordings of the rehearsals. The songs were presented to the public on [[Terry Wogan]]'s radio show the following day, after the result was known, followed later in the day with a spot on the TV magazine show ''[[Nationwide (TV series)|Nationwide]]'', where the top 5 were revealed and the winners, [[Black Lace (band)|Black Lace]], were interviewed as guests on the show.  As a result of this industrial action, all future contests were staged at [[BBC]] studios and not as outside broadcasts from venues. The 1980 result ended in a tie between [[Prima Donna (band)|Prima Donna]]'s \"Love Enough For Two\" and [[Maggie Moone]]'s \"Happy Everything\". To resolve this, in an unrehearsed panic, host [[Terry Wogan]] called back the juries to announce their favourite of the two songs. This led to extreme confusion when the scoreboard failed to keep up and some juries contradicted the results they had given earlier. Prima Donna won, with eight juries to Maggie Moone's six. A detailed check of the votes after the show did confirm that Prima Donna were the correct winners. Prima Donna were the first winners of the competition specifically formed to take part in Eurovision. This became the norm in the 1980s and the artists taking part in the contest became more and more obscure and amateurish. However, a few notable acts did enter the contest in the 1980s, with scant success. [[Adrian Baker|Liquid Gold]], [[Alvin Stardust]], [[Sinitta]] and [[Hazell Dean]] all failed to come through the heats.\n\nBy 1981, the number of songs had dropped to eight, and interest had started to wane. Four out of eight songs in both the 1982 and 1984 events were written by [[Paul Curtis (musician)|Paul Curtis]], who was unsurprisingly responsible for the 1984 winner; \"Love Games\". Following [[Belle & The Devotions]]' performance at the 1984 Eurovision contest in Luxembourg, the audience audibly booed them from the stage in an orchestrated demonstration against the song's supposed plagiarism,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2ZmVXSPyAI |title=Kit Rolfe of Belle and the Devotions interview \u2013 Part 1 |publisher=YouTube |date=1984-07-17 |accessdate=2014-06-04}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzGixIxPSzY |title=Kit Rolfe of Belle and the Devotions interview \u2013 Part 2 |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=2014-06-04}}</ref> and by the local audience retaliating against a particularly shocking violent attack by English soccer fans.<ref>O'Connor, John Kennedy. The Eurovision Song Contest: The Official History. Carlton Books, UK, 2009. {{ISBN|978-1-84732-521-1}}</ref> For 1985, the [[BBC]] wanted to revert to having one singer of their choice perform all the short listed songs and approached [[Bonnie Tyler]] and when she was unavailable, [[Lena Zavaroni]] for the task. However, the Music Publisher's Association blocked the move, wanting their members the choice of their own singers to represent their music. A compromise was reached and only solo artists or duets \u2013 no \"made for Eurovision\" acts \u2013 were permitted to take part in the 1985 UK selection process and limited two entries per songwriter. Despite this rule, both songs submitted by Paul Curtis reached the final eight. They reverted to allowing all-comers for 1986. Starting in 1985, the songs were also 'previewed' on [[Terry Wogan]]'s prime time chat show on [[BBC One|BBC1]] ahead of the final. When the series ended in 1992, the songs were presented in 1993 and 1994 in stand-alone programmes, hosted by Terry.\n\nThe number of entries briefly increased to ten in 1987 when record companies were invited to submit songs, but after a poor result from [[Rikki (British singer)|Rikki]] in the Eurovision final of 1987, the regional juries were disbanded, and the final decision given to the public through telephone voting, with a celebrity panel offering comments on the entries intended to guide viewers. This proved to be a relative success, accruing two second places and a sixth place ([[Zagreb]], 1990). However, a disappointing 10th place in Rome obtained by [[Samantha Janus]] led the BBC to rethink the standard of performers in the competition.\n\n===1990s===\nAs a result of the disappointing results in 1990 & 1991, the system that was used between 1964 and 1975 was resurrected, with the [[BBC]]'s head of light entertainment, [[James Moir|Jim Moir]] choosing one artist to perform all the songs in the UK final. [[Michael Ball (singer)|Michael Ball]] was the first in 1992, and went on to win second place. [[Sonia (singer)|Sonia]] was also second the following year. However, after a suggestion by [[Don Black (lyricist)|Don Black]] to the [[BBC]]'s new head of light entertainment [[David Liddiment]] in 1994, [[Tony Award for Best Featured Actress in a Musical|Tony Award]] winning stage star [[Frances Ruffelle]] was offered the job of representing the UK. A virtually unknown singer, unsurprisingly, interest was low. Her final position in the Eurovision Song Contest held in Dublin was a disappointing tenth, the same achieved by [[Samantha Janus]] in 1991.\n\nA dramatic modernisation was introduced in 1995 in an attempt to boost the profile of the contest. Pop supremo [[Jonathan King]] was drafted in as Executive Producer to make the event more modern. The 1995 event had a diverse range of songs and some relatively well-known acts performing, such as [[Londonbeat]] who had a hit with \"[[I've Been Thinking About You]]\", pop-combo [[Deuce (band)|Deuce]] and [[Samantha Fox|Sox]], which featured singer and former Page 3 icon [[Samantha Fox]]. All songs were presented on a special edition of ''[[Top Of The Pops]]'' prior to the live final. On the night, the well-known artists were all beaten by rap act [[Love City Groove]], whose eponymous song could only manage a disappointing tenth in Dublin that year. On a positive note, the songs by [[Love City Groove]] and [[Deuce (band)|Deuce]] (\"I Need You\") made the top 10 in the UK singles charts, reaching #7 and #10 respectively, while three other entries \u2013 Dear Jon \"One Gift of Love\" at #68, [[Londonbeat]] \"I'm Just Your Puppet On A... (String!)\" at #55 and [[Samantha Fox|Sox]] \"Go For The Heart\" at #47 \u2013  all reached the UK top 100.\n\nIn 1996, a semi-final was introduced. All eight songs were performed on ''[[Top of the Pops]]'' on 1 March, and the public voted to decide the four finalists. The results were announced the following day, but there was no information given on who finished where. On 8 March the final was held, with [[Gina G]] winning very easily with her dance number \"[[Ooh Aah... Just A Little Bit]]\". The song became an instant hit in the charts, reaching Number 1 on the UK Singles Chart. It was the first UK non-winner to do so since 1968 but it was not as successful in the Eurovision Contest itself. In [[Oslo]], Gina could only manage eighth place, but was perhaps consoled by her Europe-wide hit with the song, which also became one of the few Eurovision songs, and one of the relatively few dance songs, to be a major hit in the United States where it peaked at #12 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], was #1 on their Dance Chart and earned a [[Grammy Award for Best Dance Recording|Grammy nomination]] for Best Dance Recording.\n\nJonathan King resigned, certain that, if Gina G couldn't win, nothing he selected could, but the BBC persuaded him to stay in charge and he decided to retain the same formula again, but with an added twist. All eight contestants would be heard on [[Ken Bruce]]'s radio show on [[BBC Radio 2]], with a public vote to decide the four finalists. The four would perform on ''[[The National Lottery Live]]'' until 1998, and then on ''[[Top of the Pops]]'' in 1999. The final itself would just consist of repeats of the performances made in the above shows, in a special programme on a Sunday afternoon. Jonathan persuaded his friends Katrina and [[Kimberley Rew]], who had hit with \"[[Walking on Sunshine (Katrina and the Waves song)|Walking On Sunshine]]\", to enter a new track, \"[[Love Shine A Light]]\". This produced a win in the Eurovision Contest itself for the United Kingdom and for [[Katrina and the Waves]] in 1997, and followed with a second place for [[Imaani]] in 1998, but disappointment in 1999 for the [[all-female band]] [[Precious (band)|Precious]].\n\n===2000s===\nIn 2000, the same format continued, but the final four songs were performed live in ''A Song For Europe'', still shunted to a graveyard Sunday afternoon slot. The result proved disappointing. [[Nicki French]] gave what author [[John Kennedy O'Connor]] describes in his book '''''The Eurovision Song Contest \u2013 The Official History''''' as a far from strong performance, despite her previous chart success and attained the UK's worst ever placing at the time, a mere 16th in Stockholm with \"[[Don't Play That Song Again]]\".<ref name=JohnKennedy/> This format continued the following year, and another poor showing for the UK. [[Lindsay Dracass|Lindsay D]] only got one place higher in Copenhagen. The entries from Six Chix in 2000 and Luke Galliana, the latter of which didn't make the 2001 final, became minor hits, with Galliana just failing to make the Top 40, but becoming a popular hit on cable request line music channel [[The Box (UK TV channel)|The Box]].\n\nThe 2002 ''A Song For Europe'' generated a lot of publicity, because three of the four acts that made the final were relatively well known to TV viewers, albeit not necessarily for their singing ability. Surf 'n' Turf included [[Jonathan Maitland]] who is a TV presenter of consumer advice shows such as ''[[Watchdog (TV series)|Watchdog]]'' and ''[[House of Horrors]]''. [[Tricia Penrose]] is an actress who plays Gina in the 60s retro drama ''[[Heartbeat (UK TV series)|Heartbeat]]'' on [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]], and [[Jessica Garlick]] had made the final stages of another ITV show ''[[Pop Idol]]''. The standard of songs was stronger than previous years, and Jessica Garlick had a runaway victory of nearly 70,000 votes with her ballad \"[[Come Back (Jessica Garlick song)|Come Back]]\". The song was also a success in Eurovision with it finishing joint third with host country [[Estonia]].\n\n2003 saw terrible disappointment. The new voting system of regional televoting, where 9, 10 and 12 points were awarded to the top three songs, led to an unsuccessful winner. [[Jemini]]'s \"[[Cry Baby (Jemini song)|Cry Baby]]\" won by four points over \"Help Me\" by Emily Reed. Confidence in the UK entry was low for both fans and the public, and in the actual contest held in Riga, Jemini picked up the UK's worst-ever showing, scoring \"nul points\" and finishing last, due to a very poor performance, although some reports attempted to blame European disapproval of the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|US-UK invasion of Iraq]] for the failure of any nation to give the UK even one point. As noted by author and historian [[John Kennedy O'Connor]], with 26 entries in the Eurovision field, this made \"Cry Baby\" the least successful song in the entire history of the contest.<ref name=JohnKennedy/> No song in the Eurovision final scored \"nul points\" again until 2015.\n\n[[File:Eurovision mymu.jpg|thumb|right|Logo from 2004 to 2006]]\nThe 2004 selection was totally different. Gone was the ''Song For Europe'' name, replaced with ''Making Your Mind Up''. The radio semi-final was also gone, and the six songs were performed live in a Saturday night show. This raised the profile of the competition, although there was criticism of the fact that four of the six acts were from reality TV shows. The winner, chosen by 70% regional televoting (regions awarding 0,2,4,6,8 and 12 points) and 30% SMS and Interactive voting, was [[James Fox (singer)|James Fox]], who had finished fifth in the second series of ''[[Fame Academy]]'', with a gentle ballad \"Hold On To Our Love\", written by Gary Miller and Tim Woodcock. Viewing figures were peaked at over 7 million for the results show.  The song finished 16th at the contest in [[Istanbul]].\n\nFor 2005, six songs dropped to five, and the show was moved to an early Saturday evening slot on 5 March, to avoid a clash with ''[[Fame Academy|Comic Relief Does Fame Academy]]''; and [[Natasha Kaplinsky]] replaced Gaby Roslin as co-host with Sir Terry Wogan.  The press focused on two performers. [[Javine Hylton]] who is a relatively well-known urban singer, and [[Jordan (Katie Price)|Katie Price]], aka Jordan, a famous glamour model.  The other contestants included former [[3SL]] bandmember [[Andy Scott-Lee]], the 1996 British Eurovision entry [[Gina G]] and unknown opera trio [[Tricolore (opera trio)|Tricolore]].  The voting itself was the same format as the previous year, but this time an online jury was added to decide between the contestants to take account of the views of those watching in the rest of Europe.  After an exciting voting sequence, Javine came out on top with her ethno-urban song \"[[Touch My Fire]]\", although she also caused some controversy when she briefly [[wardrobe malfunction|fell out of her top]] during an energetic dance routine.  At the 50th Eurovision Song Contest held in [[Kiev]], Javine finished 22nd out of 24 participants in the final, the UK's second poorest finish ever.\n\nIn February 2006 it was announced that artists competing in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2006|2006 contest]] would include [[Kym Marsh]] and [[Antony Costa]], both relatively well known in the UK for their past involvement with music bands (the former appearing in [[Hear'say]] and the latter in boy band [[Blue (boy band)|Blue]]). Following the format of the previous year (and with six songs this time), ''Making Your Mind Up'' returned in 2006 in a prime-time Saturday evening slot, and was broadcast on 4 March on [[BBC One]]. [[Terry Wogan]] and [[Natasha Kaplinsky]] once again presented and were accompanied by a 'Celebrity Jury' that included chat-show host [[Jonathan Ross (television presenter)|Jonathan Ross]], pop star [[Kelly Osbourne]] and ''[[Top of the Pops]]'' presenter [[Fearne Cotton]]. The eventual winner of the 2006 contest (after the 7 tele-juries from around the UK and mobile and web votes) was [[Daz Sampson]] and his song \"Teenage Life\". Yet another low result was produced for the United Kingdom, as Daz finished 19th in the contest out of 24 competing countries.\n\nDuring a press conference on 28 February 2007, the BBC confirmed that the artists taking part in ''Making Your Mind Up'' would include [[Big Brovaz]], an [[Rhythm and blues|RnB]] group who had 4 UK Top 10 singles in 2002\u20132003, [[Brian Harvey]], a former member of the boy band [[East 17]]; [[Cyndi Almouzni|Cyndi]]; [[Justin Hawkins]] of [[The Darkness (band)|The Darkness]], performing a duet with [[Beverlei Brown]]; [[Liz McClarnon]], formerly of [[girl group]] [[Atomic Kitten]]; and [[Scooch]], the eventual winners with \"[[Flying the Flag (for You)]]\". Scooch sang their entry in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2007]] on 12 May 2007 in [[Helsinki]], Finland and finished in second-to-last place with 19 points, ahead of Ireland who placed last.\n\nFor the first time, the show was filmed at [[The Maidstone Studios]] in [[Kent]]. The hour long final was broadcast at 7:30pm on 17 March 2007 on BBC One, with the half hour results show showing at 9:30pm on the same date. Although this was past the 12 March cut-off set by the EBU, the BBC were given a special extension because the EBU were made aware of this over a year in advance.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.esctoday.com/news/read/7829|title=Exclusive: UK Final on March 17th|publisher=ESCToday|author=Viniker, Barry|date=2007-02-28}}</ref>\n\nThe show ended in disarray when [[Fearne Cotton]] shouted out that the winner was Scooch, while co-host [[Terry Wogan]] simultaneously announced the winner to be Cyndi. After some confusion from both performers, each thinking the other had won, it was revealed that the true winner was Scooch.\n\nIn 2008 the show's name was changed to ''Eurovision: Your Decision''. It was screened in two parts in March 2008, and was hosted by [[Claudia Winkleman]] and Sir [[Terry Wogan]]. The six competing acts were paired as girl groups ([[LoveShy]] and [[The Revelations]]), soloists ([[Michelle Gayle]] and [[Andy Abraham]]), and \"Joseph and Maria\" contestants (Rob McVeigh and Simona Armstrong) from the BBC talent shows ''[[Any Dream Will Do (TV series)|Any Dream Will Do]]'' and ''[[How Do You Solve A Problem Like Maria?]]''. A panel of three judges ([[John Barrowman]], [[Carrie Grant]], and Terry Wogan) decided which artists to put through to a semi-final after each pair had performed. Terry Wogan then allowed one of the rejected acts through as a \"wild card\" before viewers were invited to vote by phone to decide which two would perform again in the final. The two finalists chosen by the viewers were Michelle Gayle singing \"[[Woo (You Make Me)]]\", and Andy Abraham singing \"[[Even If (Andy Abraham song)|Even If]]\". Despite having been originally eliminated at the first stage, Terry Wogan's \"wild card\" pick turned out to be the winner when the viewers voted Andy Abraham the victor with \"[[Even If (Andy Abraham song)|Even If]]\". This received a total of 14 points in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2008]] on 24 May 2008 in [[Belgrade]], finishing in last place, although sharing the same score with Poland (24th) and Germany (23rd).\n\n[[File:Eurovision YourCountryNeedsYou.jpg|thumb|left|[[Andrew Lloyd Webber]] in a promotional image for Your Country Needs You 2009]]\nThe [[BBC]] announced in a televised call for talent on 18 October 2008, that in 2009 there would be another change to the national final. The show was renamed ''Eurovision: Your Country Needs You'', hosted by [[Graham Norton]], and followed a format similar to popular BBC talent shows ''[[I'd Do Anything (2008 TV series)|I'd Do Anything]]'' and ''[[Any Dream Will Do (TV series)|Any Dream Will Do]]''. The multi-week format had members of the public (amateur or professional) compete to represent the UK at the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2009]], which was to be held in Moscow, Russia. In the final the three remaining contestants performed the song \"[[It's My Time (Eurovision song)|It's My Time]]\",<ref>{{Cite news| url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-1127216/We-wrote-Eurovision-song-hours-says-Lloyd-Webber.html | location=London | work=Daily Mail | title=We wrote the Eurovision song in two hours, says Lloyd Webber | first=Elizabeth | last=Sanderson | date=25 January 2009}}</ref> composed by [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]] with lyrics by [[Diane Warren]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7677612.stm|title=Lloyd Webber pens Eurovision song|date=2008-10-18|publisher=[[BBC|British Broadcasting Corporation]]|accessdate=2008-10-19}}</ref> The winner of the contest was [[Jade Ewen]] who went on to score a credible fifth place at the Eurovision final in Moscow.\n\n===2010s===\nFor 2010, the BBC announced on 29 January 2010, that songwriter and music producer [[Pete Waterman]] would be writing the UK's entry for the [[Eurovision Song Contest]] in Oslo, Norway, on 29 May.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2010/01_january/29/eurovision.shtml |title=Press Office \u2013 Pete Waterman to write UK entry for Eurovision |publisher=BBC |date= |accessdate=2014-06-04}}</ref> Waterman's writing partner was [[Mike Stock (musician)|Mike Stock]] and the singer was chosen on 12 March, in a live show featuring six potential artists broadcast on BBC One, hosted by Graham Norton.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.esctoday.com/news/read/15294|title=United Kingdom: Six acts announced|last=Montebello|first=Edward|date=2010-03-05|work=ESCToday|accessdate=5 March 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/news?id=9963&_t=BBC+reveal+United+Kingdom+finalists!|title=BBC reveal United Kingdom finalists!|last=Webb|first=Glen|date=2010-03-05|publisher=[[European Broadcasting Union]]|accessdate=5 March 2010}}</ref> Waterman chose three of the six acts to perform his song \"[[That Sounds Good To Me]]\", with the televiewers then selecting the winner.

From 1986 to 1995, ''A Song For Europe'' was also broadcast on [[BBC Radio 2]] with commentary by [[Ray Moore (broadcaster)|Ray Moore]] in 1986\u201387 and later by [[Ken Bruce]] from 1988, although Radio 2 did not broadcast the results show from 1991 onwards.\n\nFrom 1992\u20131994 the programme was again pre-recorded, but the result show was live and broadcast on the same, or following night. In 1997 and 1998, the results were announced the next Saturday after the final and on the following Friday in 1999.\n\nFrom 1957\u20131960, there were various televised semi-finals ahead of the UK final. This was reintroduced in 1996, with a preliminary round of voting to eliminate 4 of the 8 songs. This was televised in 1996 but switched to radio from 1997 to 2003.\n\n===Host(s) and venue===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Year\n! Selection show\n! Venue\n! National final main host\n!

A [[forward (basketball)|forward]]/[[guard (basketball)|guard]], Bach played [[college basketball]] at [[Fordham University]] and [[Brown University]].  He was selected by the [[Boston Celtics]] in the 1948 [[National Basketball Association|Basketball Association of America]] (BAA) Draft, and played 34 games for the Celtics.\n\n==Career==\nIn 1950, at age 26, Bach became one of the nation's youngest head coaches at a major college when he took over the coaching job at [[Fordham University|Fordham]].{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} He spent 18 years there, taking seven Ram teams to post-season tourneys, before starting a long and successful coaching career at [[Penn State]], where he joined three old friends from Brown; [[Rip Engle]], [[Joe Paterno]] and [[Joe McMullen]]. Bach would later coach the [[Golden State Warriors]] for three years.  He served as an interim coach in 1980, and then as the full-time coach from 1983 to 1986. In 1986 Bach joined the [[Chicago Bulls]] as an assistant. After the team won three championships from 1991 to 1993, Bach moved on to coaching jobs with the [[Charlotte Hornets (1988\u20132002)|Charlotte Hornets]], [[Detroit Pistons]] and [[Washington Wizards]]. He returned to the Bulls in 2003, and retired in 2006.<ref name=paint>Shamus Tooney. \"From courtside to art gallery \u2013 Bulls' Bach shows off watercolors\". ''Chicago Sun-Times''.

A [[forward (basketball)|forward]]/[[guard (basketball)|guard]], Bach played [[college basketball]] at [[Fordham University]] and [[Brown University]].  He was selected by the [[Boston Celtics]] in the 1948 [[National Basketball Association|Basketball Association of America]] (BAA) Draft, and played 34 games for the Celtics.\n\n==Career==\nIn 1950, at age 26, Bach became one of the nation's youngest head coaches at a major college when he took over the coaching job at [[Fordham University|Fordham]].{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} He spent 18 years there, taking seven Ram teams to post-season tourneys, before starting a long and successful coaching career at [[Penn State]], where he joined three old friends from Brown; [[Rip Engle]], [[Joe Paterno]] and [[Joe McMullen]]. Bach would later coach the [[Golden State Warriors]] for three years.  He served as an interim coach in 1980, and then as the full-time coach from 1983 to 1986. In 1986 Bach joined the [[Chicago Bulls]] as an assistant. After the team won three championships from 1991 to 1993, Bach moved on to coaching jobs with the [[Charlotte Hornets (1988\u20132002)|Charlotte Hornets]], [[Detroit Pistons]] and [[Washington Wizards]]. He returned to the Bulls in 2003, and retired in 2006.<ref name=paint>Shamus Tooney. \"From courtside to art gallery \u2013 Bulls' Bach shows off watercolors\". ''Chicago Sun-Times''.

In 2007, thirty-two of his watercolors were put on display at the Sevan Gallery in [[Skokie, Illinois]].<ref name=paint/>\n\n==Death==\nBach died on January 18, 2016 in [[Chicago]] at the age of 91.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/basketball/bulls/ct-johnny-bach-bulls-20160118-story.html|title=Former Bulls assistant coach Johnny Bach dies|work=Chicago Tribune|accessdate=January 18, 2016|date=January 18, 2016|author=K.
