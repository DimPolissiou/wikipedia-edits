It stars [[Al Pacino]], [[Robin Williams]], [[Hilary Swank]], [[Maura Tierney]], [[Martin Donovan]], [[Nicky Katt]] and [[Paul Dooley]], and is based on [[Insomnia (1997 film)|the 1997 Norwegian film of the same name]]. The film tells the story of two [[Los Angeles Police Department|Los Angeles homicide detectives]] investigating a murder in [[Nightmute, Alaska]].\n\nReleased on May 24, 2002, ''Insomnia'' grossed over $113 million worldwide against a production budget of $46 million, and received critical praise for its screenplay, cinematography, direction, and acting, particularly Pacino's and Williams' performances.\n\n==Plot==\nIn the small fishing town of [[Nightmute, Alaska]], 17-year-old Kay Connell is found murdered. [[Los Angeles Police Department]] (LAPD) detectives Will Dormer and Hap Eckhart are sent to assist the local police with their investigation, at the request of police chief Nyback, an old colleague of Dormer's. Ellie Burr, a young local detective who is also a fan of Dormer's investigative work, picks them up when they arrive. Back in Los Angeles, [[Internal affairs (law enforcement)|Internal Affairs]] is investigating one of Dormer's past cases. Flying to Alaska, Eckhart reveals that he is going to testify against Dormer in exchange for immunity, to which Dormer responds that many criminals whom he helped to convict using [[False evidence|questionable evidence]] could go free if their cases are reopened.\n\nDormer attracts the murderer to the scene of the crime, but the suspect flees into the fog, shooting one of the police officers through the leg. Dormer spots a figure in the fog and fires with his backup weapon. Rushing to the fallen figure, Dormer picks up a .38 pistol the suspect has dropped. He then discovers that he has shot Eckhart. Because of Eckhart's pending testimony, Dormer knows that Internal Affairs will never believe the shooting was an accident, so he claims that Eckhart was shot by the suspect. He does not mention he has the .38 pistol. Burr is put in charge of the shooting investigation, and her team finds the .38 caliber bullet that hit the officer. That night, Dormer walks to an alley and fires the .38 pistol into an animal carcass, then retrieves and cleans the bullet. At the morgue, the staffer hands him the bagged bullet retrieved from Eckhart's body, but she is unfamiliar with its type. Dormer leaves and switches the .38 bullet for the 9 mm slug from Eckhart's body.\n\nOver the next few days, Dormer is plagued by insomnia, brought on by his guilt over killing Eckhart and exacerbated by the [[Midnight sun|perpetual daylight]]. Dormer starts receiving anonymous phone calls from the killer, who claims to have witnessed Dormer kill his partner. When the police learn that Kay was a fan of local crime writer Walter Finch, Dormer breaks into Finch's apartment in the nearby village of [[Umkumiut]]. Finch arrives home, realizes the police are present, and evades Dormer after a chase. Dormer returns to Finch's apartment and plants the .38 to frame Finch.\n\nFinch contacts Dormer and arranges a meeting on a ferry. Finch wants help in shifting suspicion to Kay's abusive boyfriend Randy Stetz and will stay silent about the Eckhart shooting in return. Dormer gives advice on handling police questioning. After Finch leaves Dormer on the ferry, he shows the detective a tape recorder he used to record the conversation.\n\nFinch calls Dormer and tells him that Kay's death was \"an accident\" \u2013 he beat her to death in a fit of rage after she rejected his sexual advances. The next day, Finch gives false testimony at the police station. When Finch claims Randy has a gun, Dormer realizes Finch has discovered his plant, and has hidden it at Randy's home. Randy is arrested when the gun is found at his house. Finch asks Burr to come to his lake house the next day, to collect letters indicating that Randy abused Kay.\n\nBurr returns to the scene of Eckhart's death and finds a 9 mm shell casing, which conflicts with the bullet type from Eckhart's body. She reads her own case study from an investigation Dormer was involved in and learns he has carried a 9 mm, leading her to suspect that he shot Eckhart. Meanwhile, on his last night staying in the hotel; Dormer confides in the hotel owner, Rachel Clement, about the Internal Affairs investigation: he fabricated evidence to help convict a pedophile he was certain was guilty of murdering a child, and who would have walked if Eckhart had testified.\n\nDormer learns that Burr has gone to Finch's. He finds Kay's letters in Finch's apartment and realizes that Finch intends to kill Burr. He learns of Finch's lake house and rushes there. At the house, Finch knocks Burr unconscious just as Dormer arrives, and takes Burr's gun. Dormer is too disoriented from lack of sleep to fight off Finch. Burr revives and saves Dormer, while Finch escapes. Burr reveals she knows Dormer shot Eckhart, and he admits that he is no longer certain if it was an accident. From his shed, Finch shoots at them with a shotgun, and Burr returns fire with Dormer's gun while Dormer sneaks around to Finch's location. After a scuffle in which Dormer grabs Finch's shotgun, Finch shoots Dormer with Burr's gun, and Dormer shoots and kills Finch with the shotgun. Burr rushes to the fatally wounded Dormer and comforts him by affirming that Eckhart's shooting was accidental, then moves to throw away the 9 mm shell casing to preserve Dormer's reputation. Dormer stops her, however, advising her not to lose her integrity before he dies.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Al Pacino]] as Detective Will Dormer\n* [[Robin Williams]] as Walter Finch \n* [[Hilary Swank]] as Detective Ellie Burr\n* [[Maura Tierney]] as Rachel Clement\n* [[Martin Donovan]] as Detective Hap Eckhart\n* [[Nicky Katt]] as Fred Duggar \n* [[Paul Dooley]] as Chief Charlie Nyback\n* [[Crystal Lowe]] as Kay Connell\n* [[Jay Brazeau]] as Francis\n* [[Larry Holden]] as Farrell Brooks\n* Kerry Sandomirsky as Trish Eckhart\n* [[Lorne Cardinal]] as Rich\n* [[Katharine Isabelle]] as Tanya Francke\n* [[Jonathan Jackson (actor)|Jonathan Jackson]] as Randy Stetz\n* [[Paula Shaw]] as the Coroner\n{{div col end}}\n\n== Production ==\n=== Casting ===\n''Insomnia'' has Robin Williams playing a villain, deviating from the comedic roles for which  he was earlier known.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/moviesnow/la-et-mn-robin-williams-dies-memorable-movie-roles-20140811-story.html|title=Robin Williams: Seven of his most memorable movie roles|first=Oliver|last=Gettell|website=latimes.com}}</ref> Regarding his decision to cast Williams, Nolan said: \"I think [audiences] will come away feeling like they have seen a 'new' Robin Williams.

It is the first spinosaurid reported from Asia is confidently known only from tooth [[Fossil|fossils]]; the first of which were found in the [[Sao Khua Formation]], with more teeth later recovered from the younger [[Khok Kruat Formation]]. The [[type species]] '''''Siamosaurus suteethorni''''', whose name honours Thai [[palaeontologist]] [[Varavudh Suteethorn]], was formally described in [[1986 in paleontology|1986]]. One possible ''Siamosaurus'' tooth was discovered in the Japanese [[Sebayashi Formation]] in 1994, and a tooth similar to it was found at the same site in 2015. In 2009, four teeth from China's [[Xinlong Formation]] were assigned to the spinosaurid species '''\"''Sinopliosaurus''\" ''fusuiensis''''', which may be the same animal as ''Siamosaurus''. Two partial spinosaurid skeletons have been found in Thailand, one in the Sao Khua and the other in the Khok Kruat Formation, but whether they belong to ''Siamosaurus'' or not is unclear.\n\nThe [[holotype]] tooth is {{Convert|62.5|mm|}} long and {{Convert|16.6 by 12.5|mm|}} wide at the base. Since it is a tooth taxon, ''Siamosaurus''{{'}}s body size and weight are uncertain, though it has been estimated at between {{Convert|5.1 to 9.1|m||abbr=}} and weighing {{Convert|1|tonne|short ton}}. ''Siamosaurus''<nowiki/>'s teeth were straight, oval to circular in cross section, and lined with distinct lengthwise grooves. The tooth's [[Tooth enamel|enamel]] was wrinkled, similar to that of teeth from the related genus ''[[Baryonyx]]''. ''Siamosaurus''{{'}}s identity has been questioned by many palaeontologists, who argue that its teeth are too similar to those of contemporaneous aquatic reptiles for it to be confidently classed as a dinosaur. Other researchers, who agree that the teeth are spinosaur in origin, deem them too similar to those of other Early Cretaceous spinosaurs to unequivocally raise a new genus. Based on characteristics of their teeth, ''Siamosaurus'' and \"''Sinopliosaurus''\" ''fusuiensis'' have been placed in the [[Spinosaurinae]] [[subfamily]].\n\nLike all spinosaurids, ''Siamosaurus''{{'}}s teeth were conical, with reduced or absent [[Serration|serrations]]. This made them suitable for impaling rather than tearing flesh, a trait typically seen in largely [[piscivorous]] (fish-eating) animals. Its relatives are known to have also consumed [[Pterosaur|pterosaurs]] and small to medium-sized dinosaurs, and there is fossil evidence of ''Siamosaurus'' eating [[Sauropoda|sauropod]] dinosaurs, either via scavenging or hunting. ''Siamosaurus'' lived in a [[Semi-arid climate|semi-arid]] habitat of [[Floodplain|floodplains]] and meandering rivers, where it coexisted with other theropod, sauropod, and (in at least the Khok Kruat Formation) [[Iguanodontia|iguanodontian]] dinosaurs. [[Isotope analysis]] indicates spinosaurids may have had [[semiaquatic]] habits, and ''Siamosaurus''<nowiki/>'s role as a piscivorous predator might have reduced the prominence of contemporaneous [[Crocodilia|crocodilians]] competing for the same food source.\n\n== History of discovery ==\n[[File:Cretaceous_strata_in_northeast_and_southeastern_Thailand.png|thumb|left|Geological map of the [[Khorat Plateau]] in northeast Thailand]]\n\nThe [[Sao Khua Formation]], where the first ''Siamosaurus'' [[Fossil|fossils]] were discovered, is part of the [[Khorat Group]].<ref name=\":0\">Buffetaut, E.; and Ingevat, R.

They are also oval in cross section and have distinct carinae, but unlike the Khok Kruat morphotype, the entire length of the crown has wrinkled enamel, and the flutes are coarser and fewer in number, with 11 to 16 on each side. The ''Siamosaurus'' morphotype also shares with ''Siamosaurus suteethorni'', GMNH-PV-999, and IVPP V 4793 a wrinkled enamel surface, and between 12 to 15 flutes on each side.''<ref name=\":24\" />''\n\n=== Possible material ===\n[[File:Sebayashi_spinosaurid_teeth.png|thumb|left|Partial tooth of an indeterminate spinosaurid (KDC-PV-0003) and possible ''Siamosaurus'' tooth (GMNH-PV-999), in the [[National Museum of Nature and Science]], Tokyo]]\n\nThe first Sebayashi Formation specimen (GMNH-PV-999) is an isolated tooth crown with a partially intact root. It is unknown on which jaw the tooth was positioned nor which surface faced the inside or outside of the mouth. The tooth's front and back carinae are well-defined, though the former is not well preserved. Besides having a broader, {{Convert|20 by 14|mm||adj=on}} wide base and being slightly smaller at {{Convert|51|mm|}} in length, GMNH-PV-999 has a very similar morphology to the ''Siamosaurus suteethorni'' holotype. Features shared between the two specimens include: a straight and only slightly compressed shape; a somewhat oval cross section; no serrations on the carinae (possibly due to bad preservation); and a flutes on the crown surface, the Japan specimen having 12 on each side. The specimens also share a crown surface with numerous small granular structures oriented parallel to their lengths. Because of these resemblances, Hasegawa and colleagues regarded GMNH-PV-999 as nearly identical to DMR TF 2043a.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\nKDC-PV-0003, the second tooth found in the Sebayashi Formation, consists of a slightly recurved crown fragment with a preserved length of {{Convert|10|mm|}}. At its base, the crown is {{Convert|7.4|mm|}} long and {{Convert|6.8|mm|}} wide, with an almost circular cross section. Though less complete than the former specimens, KDC-PV-0003 exhibits better preservation of small details such as visible serrations, although poorly defined ones. The denticles, of which there are two to three every {{Convert|1|mm||adj=on}}, are visible only on the front carinae, due to the rear of the tooth being obscured by rock [[Matrix (geology)|matrix]]. A {{Convert|5.5|mm||adj=on}} long gap at the fossil's base exposes the dentine, which is covered in a {{Convert|1.6|mm||adj=on}} thick layer of enamel. The little that is preserved of KDC-PV-0003 shows that like the first Sebayashi Formation tooth, it has a granular texture and a minimum of 12 flutes on its surface, not all of which stretch to the full length of the crown. The granular structures of KDC-PV-0003 are sharper than in GMNH-PV-999. The interdenticle sulci (tiny furrows near the gaps between each denticle) of KDC-PV-0003 have an [[Oblique angle|oblique]] orientation of 45 degrees, exactly like those seen in GMNH-PV-999.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nOut of the four teeth referred to \"''Sinopliosaurus''\" ''fusuiensis'', specimen [[IVPP]] V 4793 is the most intact, although still somewhat deformed. The crown, which is missing its tip, is {{Convert|69|mm|}} long and {{Convert|16.5 by 13|mm|}} wide at the base. The tooth is straight, only slightly recurved, and has an oval cross section. The front and rear carinae are distinct, though their serrations have been heavily eroded, similar to those of KDC-PV-0003. Like the Thailand and Japan teeth, the \"''Sinopliosaurus''\" ''fusuiensis'' specimens bear developed flutes and a granular surface. As in both Sebayashi Formation teeth, there are 12 flutes on each face of \"''Sinopliosaurus''\" ''fusuiensis''{{'}}s teeth. Like in KDC-PV-0003, these flutes are of varied lengths. Buffetaut and colleagues likened the \"''Sinopliosaurus''\" ''fusuiensis'' teeth most to those of ''Siamosaurus'', given their identical crown shape, fluting, and granular enamel.<ref name=\"EBetal082\" />\n\n== Classification ==\n[[File:Spinosaurus_sp_Marocco_Cenom.JPG|thumb|Tooth of the related genus ''[[Spinosaurus]]'', Museo di Storia Naturale A. Stoppani, [[Lombardy]]]]\n\nIn 1986, Buffetaut and Ingavat classified ''Siamosaurus'' as a theropod because of the straight tall crown and double lateral recurvature of its teeth. At the time, ''Siamosaurus''{{'}}s particular combination of dental characteristics, especially the longitudinal fluting and lack of serrations, had not been observed in other theropods. The authors noted similarities in ''Siamosaurus''{{'}}s teeth to those of [[Ceratosauria|ceratosaurian]] tooth crowns, some of which also have longitudinal flutes. However, this identification was ruled out, since ceratosaur teeth differ in cross section, bear far fewer dental flutes, and have distinct serrations. Buffetaut and Suteethorn concluded that the closest taxon in dentition to ''Siamosaurus'' was ''Spinosaurus''. Like ''Siamosaurus,'' this African genus had straight and unserrated conical teeth, and though ''Spinosaurus'' lacked the developed flutes seen in ''Siamosaurus,'' Buffetaut and Ingavat noted that both smooth and fluted spinosaur teeth have been reported from Africa.

In this study, the teeth of ''Siamosaurus'' and a Morrocan spinosaurid were compared to those of crocodilians using [[Scanning electron microscope|scanning electron microscopy]]. Lauprasert found that spinosaurids and crocodilians may have employed similar feeding tactics and been under comparable [[Constraint (classical mechanics)|mechanical constraints]], based on resemblances in the [[microstructure]] of their tooth enamel. Lauprasert suggested that ''Siamosaurus'' could have therefore replaced the [[ecological niche]] of contemporaneous long-snouted crocodilians as a piscivorous predator. He notes that this likely occurred in correlation with the rising aridity of the Sao Khua and Khok Kruat Formations during the Early Cretaceous, since ''Siamosaurus'' had better mobility in a dry environment than crocodilians did. This could explain the absence of long-snouted crocodilian fossils from that time and place.<ref name=\":11\">{{Cite thesis|last=Lauprasert|first=Komsorn|title=Evolution and palaeoecology of crocodiles in the mesozoic of Khorat plateau, Thailand|date=2006|publisher=Chulalongkorn University|url=https://cuir.car.chula.ac.th/handle/123456789/14411|language=en}}</ref> A similar scenario was proposed for spinosaurids by Hone and colleagues in 2010, who noted that compared to large crocodilians and obligate aquatic predators, they could more easily travel from one body of water to another in search for prey.<ref name=\":19\" />\n\n=== Aquatic habits ===\n\nA 2010 publication by French palaeontologist Romain Amiot and colleagues found that the [[isotopes of oxygen|oxygen isotope]] ratios of spinosaurid bones indicated [[semiaquatic]] lifestyles. Isotope ratios of spinosaurid teeth from various localities, including Thailand and China, were compared with isotopic compositions from contemporaneous theropods, turtles, and crocodilians. The study revealed that, among theropods, spinosaurid isotope ratios were closer to those of turtles and crocodilians. Thai spinosaurid teeth tended to have the largest difference from the ratios of other theropods, and those from Morocco tended to have the least difference. The authors concluded that spinosaurids, like modern crocodilians and hippopotamuses, spent much of their daily lives in or near water. They also suggested that semiaquatic habits and piscivory may explain how spinosaurids coexisted with other large theropods; by feeding on different prey items and occupying a distinct ecological niche, the different types of theropods would have been out of direct competition.<ref name=\":21\" /><ref name=\"RMetal10\">{{cite journal |last=Amiot |first=R. |author2=Buffetaut, E. |author3=L\u00e9cuyer, C. |author4=Wang, X. |author5=Boudad, L. |author6=Ding, Z. |author7=Fourel, F. |author8=Hutt, S. |author9=Martineau, F. |author10=Medeiros, A. |author11=Mo, J. |author12=Simon, L. |author13=Suteethorn, V. |author14=Sweetman, S. |author15=Tong, H. |author16=Zhang, F. |author17=Zhou, Z. |year=2010 |title=Oxygen isotope evidence for semi-aquatic habits among spinosaurid theropods |journal=Geology |volume=38 |issue=2 |pages=139\u2013142 |doi=10.1130/G30402.1|bibcode=2010Geo....38..139A }}</ref>\n\n== Palaeoenvironment and palaeobiogeography ==\n[[File:Sao_Khua_Formation_V2.png|thumb|left|Restoration of ''Siamosaurus'' hunting fish in the Sao Khua Formation, with a herd of ''[[Phuwiangosaurus]]'' in the background]]\n\nThe sediments of the Sao Khua Formation, composed of [[Red clay|red clays]], [[Mudstone|mudstones]], [[Sandstone|sandstones]], [[Siltstone|siltstones]] and [[Conglomerate (geology)|conglomerate]] rocks, record a [[fluvial]] environment dominated by lakes, [[Floodplain|floodplains]], and meandering low-energy rivers.<ref name=\":12\" /><ref name=\":3\">{{Cite journal|last=Eric|first=Buffetaut|last2=Varavudh|first2=Suteethorn|date=1998|title=The biogeographical significance of the Mesozoic vertebrates from Thailand|url=http://doc.rero.ch/record/15441|journal=Biogeography and Geological Evolution of SE Asia|language=en}}</ref> This is consistent with the types of vertebrate fauna present in the formation, which comprise only terrestrial or freshwater animals, including dinosaurs, turtles, freshwater [[hybodont sharks]] and [[Actinopterygii|actinopterygian]] fishes, and the freshwater crocodilian ''[[Sunosuchus]]''.<ref name=\":1\" /> Besides ''Siamosaurus'', there were dinosaurs like the [[Metriacanthosauridae|metriacanthosaurid]] ''Siamotyrannus isanensis'',<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Carrano|first1=M.

Two partial spinosaurid skeletons have been found in Thailand, one in the Sao Khua and the other in the Khok Kruat Formation, but whether they belong to ''Siamosaurus'' or not is unclear.\n\nThe [[holotype]] tooth is {{Convert|62.5|mm|}} long and {{Convert|16.6 by 12.5|mm|}} wide at the base. Since it is a tooth taxon, ''Siamosaurus''{{'}}s body size and weight are uncertain, though it has been estimated at between {{Convert|5.1 to 9.1|m||abbr=}} and weighing {{Convert|1|tonne|short ton}}. ''Siamosaurus''<nowiki/>'s teeth were straight, oval to circular in cross section, and lined with distinct lengthwise grooves. The tooth's [[Tooth enamel|enamel]] was wrinkled, similar to that of teeth from the related genus ''[[Baryonyx]]''. ''Siamosaurus''{{'}}s identity has been questioned by many palaeontologists, who argue that its teeth are too similar to those of contemporaneous aquatic reptiles for it to be confidently classed as a dinosaur. Other researchers, who agree that the teeth are spinosaur in origin, deem them too similar to those of other Early Cretaceous spinosaurs to unequivocally raise a new genus. Based on characteristics of their teeth, ''Siamosaurus'' and \"''Sinopliosaurus''\" ''fusuiensis'' have been placed in the [[Spinosaurinae]] [[subfamily]].\n\nLike all spinosaurids, ''Siamosaurus''{{'}}s teeth were conical, with reduced or absent [[Serration|serrations]]. This made them suitable for impaling rather than tearing flesh, a trait typically seen in largely [[piscivorous]] (fish-eating) animals. Its relatives are known to have also consumed [[Pterosaur|pterosaurs]] and small to medium-sized dinosaurs, and there is fossil evidence of ''Siamosaurus'' eating [[Sauropoda|sauropod]] dinosaurs, either via scavenging or hunting. ''Siamosaurus'' lived in a [[Semi-arid climate|semi-arid]] habitat of [[Floodplain|floodplains]] and meandering rivers, where it coexisted with other theropod, sauropod, and (in at least the Khok Kruat Formation) [[Iguanodontia|iguanodontian]] dinosaurs. [[Isotope analysis]] indicates spinosaurids may have had [[semiaquatic]] habits, and ''Siamosaurus''<nowiki/>'s role as a piscivorous predator might have reduced the prominence of contemporaneous [[Crocodilia|crocodilians]] competing for the same food source.\n\n== History of discovery ==\n[[File:Cretaceous_strata_in_northeast_and_southeastern_Thailand.png|thumb|left|Geological map of the [[Khorat Plateau]] in northeast Thailand]]\n\nThe [[Sao Khua Formation]], where the first ''Siamosaurus'' [[Fossil|fossils]] were discovered, is part of the [[Khorat Group]].<ref name=\":0\">Buffetaut, E.; and Ingevat, R.

The tooth is relatively straight, with only minor front to back curvature. It is oval in cross section while other specimens are nearly circular in this aspect.

They are also oval in cross section and have distinct carinae, but unlike the Khok Kruat morphotype, the entire length of the crown has wrinkled enamel, and the flutes are coarser and fewer in number, with 11 to 16 on each side. The ''Siamosaurus'' morphotype also shares with ''Siamosaurus suteethorni'', GMNH-PV-999, and IVPP V 4793 a wrinkled enamel surface, and between 12 to 15 flutes on each side.''<ref name=\":24\" />''\n\n=== Possible material ===\n[[File:Sebayashi_spinosaurid_teeth.png|thumb|left|Partial tooth of an indeterminate spinosaurid (KDC-PV-0003) and possible ''Siamosaurus'' tooth (GMNH-PV-999), in the [[National Museum of Nature and Science]], Tokyo]]\n\nThe first Sebayashi Formation specimen (GMNH-PV-999) is an isolated tooth crown with a partially intact root. It is unknown on which jaw the tooth was positioned nor which surface faced the inside or outside of the mouth. The tooth's front and back carinae are well-defined, though the former is not well preserved. Besides having a broader, {{Convert|20 by 14|mm||adj=on}} wide base and being slightly smaller at {{Convert|51|mm|}} in length, GMNH-PV-999 has a very similar morphology to the ''Siamosaurus suteethorni'' holotype. Features shared between the two specimens include: a straight and only slightly compressed shape; a somewhat oval cross section; no serrations on the carinae (possibly due to bad preservation); and a flutes on the crown surface, the Japan specimen having 12 on each side. The specimens also share a crown surface with numerous small granular structures oriented parallel to their lengths. Because of these resemblances, Hasegawa and colleagues regarded GMNH-PV-999 as nearly identical to DMR TF 2043a.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\nKDC-PV-0003, the second tooth found in the Sebayashi Formation, consists of a slightly recurved crown fragment with a preserved length of {{Convert|10|mm|}}. At its base, the crown is {{Convert|7.4|mm|}} long and {{Convert|6.8|mm|}} wide, with an almost circular cross section. Though less complete than the former specimens, KDC-PV-0003 exhibits better preservation of small details such as visible serrations, although poorly defined ones. The denticles, of which there are two to three every {{Convert|1|mm||adj=on}}, are visible only on the front carinae, due to the rear of the tooth being obscured by rock [[Matrix (geology)|matrix]]. A {{Convert|5.5|mm||adj=on}} long gap at the fossil's base exposes the dentine, which is covered in a {{Convert|1.6|mm||adj=on}} thick layer of enamel. The little that is preserved of KDC-PV-0003 shows that like the first Sebayashi Formation tooth, it has a granular texture and a minimum of 12 flutes on its surface, not all of which stretch to the full length of the crown. The granular structures of KDC-PV-0003 are sharper than in GMNH-PV-999. The interdenticle sulci (tiny furrows near the gaps between each denticle) of KDC-PV-0003 have an [[Oblique angle|oblique]] orientation of 45 degrees, exactly like those seen in GMNH-PV-999.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nOut of the four teeth referred to \"''Sinopliosaurus''\" ''fusuiensis'', specimen [[IVPP]] V 4793 is the most intact, although still somewhat deformed. The crown, which is missing its tip, is {{Convert|69|mm|}} long and {{Convert|16.5 by 13|mm|}} wide at the base. The tooth is straight, only slightly recurved, and has an oval cross section. The front and rear carinae are distinct, though their serrations have been heavily eroded, similar to those of KDC-PV-0003. Like the Thailand and Japan teeth, the \"''Sinopliosaurus''\" ''fusuiensis'' specimens bear developed flutes and a granular surface. As in both Sebayashi Formation teeth, there are 12 flutes on each face of \"''Sinopliosaurus''\" ''fusuiensis''{{'}}s teeth. Like in KDC-PV-0003, these flutes are of varied lengths. Buffetaut and colleagues likened the \"''Sinopliosaurus''\" ''fusuiensis'' teeth most to those of ''Siamosaurus'', given their identical crown shape, fluting, and granular enamel.<ref name=\"EBetal082\" />\n\n== Classification ==\n[[File:Spinosaurus_sp_Marocco_Cenom.JPG|thumb|Tooth of the related genus ''[[Spinosaurus]]'', Museo di Storia Naturale A. Stoppani, [[Lombardy]]]]\n\nIn 1986, Buffetaut and Ingavat classified ''Siamosaurus'' as a theropod because of the straight tall crown and double lateral recurvature of its teeth. At the time, ''Siamosaurus''{{'}}s particular combination of dental characteristics, especially the longitudinal fluting and lack of serrations, had not been observed in other theropods. The authors noted similarities in ''Siamosaurus''{{'}}s teeth to those of [[Ceratosauria|ceratosaurian]] tooth crowns, some of which also have longitudinal flutes. However, this identification was ruled out, since ceratosaur teeth differ in cross section, bear far fewer dental flutes, and have distinct serrations. Buffetaut and Suteethorn concluded that the closest taxon in dentition to ''Siamosaurus'' was ''Spinosaurus''. Like ''Siamosaurus,'' this African genus had straight and unserrated conical teeth, and though ''Spinosaurus'' lacked the developed flutes seen in ''Siamosaurus,'' Buffetaut and Ingavat noted that both smooth and fluted spinosaur teeth have been reported from Africa. Therefore, they tentatively placed ''Siamosaurus'' in the Spinosauridae [[Family (biology)|family]], based on close similarities in dentition to ''Spinosaurus aegyptiacus.<ref name=\":0\" />''<ref name=\":14\" />\n\nMany palaeontologists have expressed skepticism towards Buffetaut and Ingavat's identification of ''Siamosaurus'', given that spinosaurid teeth, including many from Asia, have been time and again mistaken for those of aquatic reptiles like crocodilians, plesiosaurs, and ichthyosaurs.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Buffetaut|first=Eric|date=2010-01-01|title=Spinosaurs before Stromer: early finds of spinosaurid dinosaurs and their interpretations|url=http://sp.lyellcollection.org/content/343/1/175|journal=Geological Society, London, Special Publications|language=en|volume=343|issue=1|pages=175\u2013188|bibcode=2010GSLSP.343..175B|doi=10.1144/SP343.10|issn=0305-8719}}</ref> In view of this, the German palaeontologist [[Hans-Dieter Sues]] and colleagues in 2002 argued that there is not enough material to confidently identify ''Siamosaurus'' as a dinosaur.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Sues|first=Hans-Dieter|last2=Frey|first2=Eberhard|last3=Martill|first3=David M.|last4=Scott|first4=Diane M.|date=2002-09-19|title=Irritator challengeri, a spinosaurid (Dinosauria: Theropoda) from the Lower Cretaceous of Brazil|journal=Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology|language=en|volume=22|issue=3|pages=535\u2013547|doi=10.1671/0272-4634(2002)022[0535:icasdt]2.0.co;2|issn=0272-4634}}</ref> In 2004, American palaeontologist [[Thomas Holtz]] and colleagues considered it a [[nomen dubium|''nomen dubium'']] (dubious name), stating that its teeth might instead belong to contemporaneous fish such as [[saurodontid]] or [[Ichthyodectidae|ichthyodectid]] [[Teleost|teleosts]].<ref name=\"HMC04\">Holtz Jr., T.R., Molnar, R.E., and Currie, P.J.

In this study, the teeth of ''Siamosaurus'' and a Morrocan spinosaurid were compared to those of crocodilians using [[Scanning electron microscope|scanning electron microscopy]]. Lauprasert found that spinosaurids and crocodilians may have employed similar feeding tactics and been under comparable [[Constraint (classical mechanics)|mechanical constraints]], based on resemblances in the [[microstructure]] of their tooth enamel. Lauprasert suggested that ''Siamosaurus'' could have therefore replaced the [[ecological niche]] of contemporaneous long-snouted crocodilians as a piscivorous predator. He notes that this likely occurred in correlation with the rising aridity of the Sao Khua and Khok Kruat Formations during the Early Cretaceous, since ''Siamosaurus'' had better mobility in a dry environment than crocodilians did. This could explain the absence of long-snouted crocodilian fossils from that time and place.<ref name=\":11\">{{Cite thesis|last=Lauprasert|first=Komsorn|title=Evolution and palaeoecology of crocodiles in the mesozoic of Khorat plateau, Thailand|date=2006|publisher=Chulalongkorn University|url=https://cuir.car.chula.ac.th/handle/123456789/14411|language=en}}</ref> A similar scenario was proposed for spinosaurids by Hone and colleagues in 2010, who noted that compared to large crocodilians and obligate aquatic predators, they could more easily travel from one body of water to another in search for prey.<ref name=\":19\" />\n\n=== Aquatic habits ===\n\nA 2010 publication by French palaeontologist Romain Amiot and colleagues found that the [[isotopes of oxygen|oxygen isotope]] ratios of spinosaurid bones indicated [[semiaquatic]] lifestyles. Isotope ratios of spinosaurid teeth from various localities, including Thailand and China, were compared with isotopic compositions from contemporaneous theropods, turtles, and crocodilians. The study revealed that, among theropods, spinosaurid isotope ratios were closer to those of turtles and crocodilians. Thai spinosaurid teeth tended to have the largest difference from the ratios of other theropods, and those from Morocco tended to have the least difference. The authors concluded that spinosaurids, like modern crocodilians and hippopotamuses, spent much of their daily lives in or near water. They also suggested that semiaquatic habits and piscivory may explain how spinosaurids coexisted with other large theropods; by feeding on different prey items and occupying a distinct ecological niche, the different types of theropods would have been out of direct competition.<ref name=\":21\" /><ref name=\"RMetal10\">{{cite journal |last=Amiot |first=R. |author2=Buffetaut, E. |author3=L\u00e9cuyer, C. |author4=Wang, X. |author5=Boudad, L. |author6=Ding, Z. |author7=Fourel, F. |author8=Hutt, S. |author9=Martineau, F. |author10=Medeiros, A. |author11=Mo, J. |author12=Simon, L. |author13=Suteethorn, V. |author14=Sweetman, S. |author15=Tong, H. |author16=Zhang, F. |author17=Zhou, Z. |year=2010 |title=Oxygen isotope evidence for semi-aquatic habits among spinosaurid theropods |journal=Geology |volume=38 |issue=2 |pages=139\u2013142 |doi=10.1130/G30402.1|bibcode=2010Geo....38..139A }}</ref>\n\n== Palaeoenvironment and palaeobiogeography ==\n[[File:Sao_Khua_Formation_V2.png|thumb|left|Restoration of ''Siamosaurus'' hunting fish in the Sao Khua Formation, with a herd of ''[[Phuwiangosaurus]]'' in the background]]\n\nThe sediments of the Sao Khua Formation, composed of [[Red clay|red clays]], [[Mudstone|mudstones]], [[Sandstone|sandstones]], [[Siltstone|siltstones]] and [[Conglomerate (geology)|conglomerate]] rocks, record a [[fluvial]] environment dominated by lakes, [[Floodplain|floodplains]], and meandering low-energy rivers.<ref name=\":12\" /><ref name=\":3\">{{Cite journal|last=Eric|first=Buffetaut|last2=Varavudh|first2=Suteethorn|date=1998|title=The biogeographical significance of the Mesozoic vertebrates from Thailand|url=http://doc.rero.ch/record/15441|journal=Biogeography and Geological Evolution of SE Asia|language=en}}</ref> This is consistent with the types of vertebrate fauna present in the formation, which comprise only terrestrial or freshwater animals, including dinosaurs, turtles, freshwater [[hybodont sharks]] and [[Actinopterygii|actinopterygian]] fishes, and the freshwater crocodilian ''[[Sunosuchus]]''.<ref name=\":1\" /> Besides ''Siamosaurus'', there were dinosaurs like the [[Metriacanthosauridae|metriacanthosaurid]] ''Siamotyrannus isanensis'',<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Carrano|first1=M.

Containment is undertaken in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to trace and isolate those infected as well as introduce other measures of infection control and vaccinations to stop the disease from spreading to the rest of the population. When it is no longer possible to contain the spread of the disease, efforts then move to the mitigation stage: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the healthcare system and society. A combination of both containment and mitigation measures may be undertaken at the same time.<ref name=\"NY0JD\" /> Suppression requires more extreme measures so as to reverse the pandemic by reducing the [[basic reproduction number]] to less than 1.<ref name=\"ImpCollege16mar2020\" />\n\nPart of managing an infectious disease outbreak is trying to decrease the epidemic peak, known as flattening the epidemic curve.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> This decreases the risk of health services being overwhelmed and provides more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> Non-pharmaceutical interventions that may manage the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing face masks, and self-quarantine; community measures aimed at physical distancing such as closing schools and cancelling mass gathering events; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such surface cleaning.<ref name=\"community mitigation\" />\n\nMore drastic actions aimed at containing the outbreak were taken in China once the severity of the outbreak became apparent, such as quarantining entire cities and imposing strict travel bans.<ref name=\"RwmYm\" /> Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus. South Korea introduced mass screening and localised quarantines, and issued alerts on the movements of infected individuals. Singapore provided financial support for those infected who quarantined themselves and imposed large fines for those who failed to do so. Taiwan increased face mask production and penalised hoarding of medical supplies.<ref name=\"shZdf\" />\n\nSimulations for Great Britain and the United States show that mitigation (slowing but not stopping epidemic spread) and suppression (reversing epidemic growth) have major challenges.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Optimal mitigation policies might reduce peak healthcare demand by 2/3 and deaths by half, but still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and health systems being overwhelmed.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Suppression can be preferred but needs to be maintained for as long as the virus is circulating in the human population (or until a vaccine becomes available), as transmission otherwise quickly rebounds when measures are relaxed. Long-term intervention to suppress the pandemic has considerable social and economic costs.<ref name=\"ImpCollege16mar2020\" />\n\n====Contact tracing====\n\n[[Contact tracing]] is an important method for health authorities to determine the source of an infection and to prevent further transmission.<ref name=\"web\" /> The use of location data from mobile phones by governments for this purpose has

Containment is undertaken in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to trace and isolate those infected as well as introduce other measures of infection control and vaccinations to stop the disease from spreading to the rest of the population. When it is no longer possible to contain the spread of the disease, efforts then move to the mitigation stage: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the healthcare system and society. A combination of both containment and mitigation measures may be undertaken at the same time.<ref name=\"NY0JD\" /> Suppression requires more extreme measures so as to reverse the pandemic by reducing the [[basic reproduction number]] to less than 1.<ref name=\"ImpCollege16mar2020\" />\n\nPart of managing an infectious disease outbreak is trying to decrease the epidemic peak, known as flattening the epidemic curve.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> This decreases the risk of health services being overwhelmed and provides more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> Non-pharmaceutical interventions that may manage the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing face masks, and self-quarantine; community measures aimed at physical distancing such as closing schools and cancelling mass gathering events; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such surface cleaning.<ref name=\"community mitigation\" />\n\nMore drastic actions aimed at containing the outbreak were taken in China once the severity of the outbreak became apparent, such as quarantining entire cities and imposing strict travel bans.<ref name=\"RwmYm\" /> Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus. South Korea introduced mass screening and localized quarantines, and issued alerts on the movements of infected individuals. Singapore provided financial support for those infected who quarantined themselves and imposed large fines for those who failed to do so. Taiwan increased face mask production and penalized hoarding of medical supplies.<ref name=\"shZdf\" />\n\nSimulations for Great Britain and the United States show that mitigation (slowing but not stopping epidemic spread) and suppression (reversing epidemic growth) have major challenges.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Optimal mitigation policies might reduce peak healthcare demand by 2/3 and deaths by half, but still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and health systems being overwhelmed.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Suppression can be preferred but needs to be maintained for as long as the virus is circulating in the human population (or until a vaccine becomes available), as transmission otherwise quickly rebounds when measures are relaxed. Long-term intervention to suppress the pandemic has considerable social and economic costs.<ref name=\"ImpCollege16mar2020\" />\n\n====Contact tracing====\n\n[[Contact tracing]] is an important method for health authorities to determine the source of an infection and to prevent further transmission.<ref name=\"web\" /> The use of location data from mobile phones by governments for this purpose has

It is focused around a series of [[cross-genre]] video games. The [[Sakura Wars (1996 video game)|first game in the series]] was released in 1996, with five sequels and numerous spin-off titles being released since then. The series\u2014set during a fictionalized version of the [[Taish\u014d period]]\u2014depicts groups of women with magical abilities using steam-powered [[mecha]] to combat demonic threats.\n\nThe original ''Sakura Wars'' was an ambitious title for the then-in-production [[Sega Saturn]]. The first game's overlap of the [[Tactical role-playing game|tactical role-playing]], [[dating sim]] and [[visual novel]] genres prompted Sega to classify it as a \"dramatic adventure\", a moniker which has endured during the series' lifetime. Both Red Entertainment and Sega co-developed most of the games until 2008, when the series went on hiatus. Sega rebooted the series as sole developer due to fan demand. Recurring elements include anime cutscenes created by notable studios including [[Production I.G]], and music by composer [[Kohei Tanaka (composer)|Kohei Tanaka]].\n\nThe series has sold over 4.5 million copies as of 2010, and garnered both critical and popular acclaim. The original Sega console games have been voted among the most popular for the Saturn and Dreamcast. The ''Sakura Wars'' franchise includes numerous [[anime]] productions, manga, and other media projects such as stage shows. With the exception of ''[[Sakura Wars: So Long, My Love]]'' and the 2019 [[Sakura Wars (2019 video game)|soft reboot]], the video game series has not been released in English. Several of the anime series have been localized for English territories.\n\n==Games==\n{{See also|List of Sakura Wars media}}\n===Main series===\n{| class=\"infobox\" style=\"float: right\"\n|-\n|<p align=\"center\">'''Main series releases'''\n* ''[[Sakura Wars (1996 video game)|Sakura Wars]]'' (1996)\n* ''[[Sakura Wars 2: Thou Shalt Not Die]]'' (1998)\n* ''[[Sakura Wars 3: Is Paris Burning?]]'' (2001)\n* ''[[Sakura Wars 4: Fall in Love, Maidens]]'' (2002)\n* ''[[Sakura Wars: So Long, My Love]]'' (2005)\n* ''[[Sakura Wars (2019 video game)|Sakura Wars]]'' (2019)\n|}\nThe original ''[[Sakura Wars (1996 video game)|Sakura Wars]]'' was released in 1996 for the [[Sega Saturn]].<ref name=\"SakuraSeriesIndex\"/> It was ported to a number of platforms including [[Dreamcast]], [[Microsoft Windows]] and mobile devices.<ref name=\"SakuraVersions\"/> A remake for the [[PlayStation 2]] (PS2), ''Sakura Wars: In Hot Blood'', was released in 2003.

While a few men are capable of using them, women form the main combat units due to their stronger spiritual power. This group is known as the Imperial Assault Force, based in a theater and working undercover as the Imperial Theater Revue.<ref name=\"SakuraOverview\"/><ref name=\"4Gsakura\"/> The group to which the protagonists belong is the Flower Division (Hanagumi), the main combat troop. Other groups make cameo appearances in the story if present.<ref name=\"ProjectSakura\"/><ref name=\"SakuraOverview\"/><ref name=\"SakuraRedOverview\"/>\n\nThe first four games follow the military and romantic exploits of Imperial Army officer Ichiro Ogami. Originally assigned to the Imperial Assault Force in Tokyo, he later traveled to Paris and trained the newly-formed Paris Assault Force before returning to Tokyo and commanding the two united Flower Divisions during the events of ''Sakura Wars 4''.<ref name=\"4Gsakura\"/><ref name=\"Sakura4Info\"/> For ''So Long, My Love'', the lead protagonist was changed to Ogami's nephew Shinjiro Taiga, who is sent in place of Ogami to train the New York Combat Revue.<ref name=\"SakuraVinfo\"/> The 2019 soft reboot of ''Sakura Wars'' takes place in 1940, twelve years after an event called the \"Great Demon War\" saw the destruction of all three original Flower Divisions. New divisions were created across the world and began competing with each other, with the newly-reformed Tokyo Flower Division being the main protagonists.<ref name=\"ProjectSakura\"/>\n\n===Gameplay===\nThe gameplay of ''Sakura Wars'' incorporate [[Role-playing video game|role-playing]], [[dating sim]] and [[visual novel]] elements.<ref name=\"SakuraOverview\"/><ref name=\"Sakura2019battleA\"/> This blend of genres and styles resulted in it being labeled as a new genre dubbed \"dramatic adventure\" in its marketing.<ref name=\"SSMinterviewDrama\"/> The original combination of narrative and [[Tactical role-playing game|tactical role-playing ]] gameplay was inspired by the ''[[Fire Emblem]]'' series.{{sfn|Mainichi|2003|p=343\u2013344}} The gameplay is split between adventure-style segments where the player explores environments and interacts with cast members; and battle sections where choices during the adventure segments come into play. With the main female cast, the protagonist can pursue a romance.<ref name=\"SakuraOverview\"/> Romance options can be carried between the first four titles using save data.<ref name=\"Sakura4Gameplay2\"/>\n\nThroughout the series, the games have used different battle systems. The first ''Sakura Wars'' and its sequel made use of a traditional [[Turn-based strategy|turn-based battle system]] on a tilted two-dimensional grid-based battlefield. Each unit has two actions from a selection of five.<ref name=\"SakuraGameplayMag\"/><ref name=\"SakuraGameplay\"/> The sequel expanded the selection to six, and included cinematic attacks. The leader could also issue commands to the entire squad to take specific battle formations.<ref name=\"Sakura2Gameplay1\"/><ref name=\"Sakura2Gameplay2\"/> ''Sakura Wars 3'' introduced the \"Active & Realtime Machine System\" (ARMS), which takes place in three-dimensional battle arenas. Under this system, units have an allotment of Action Points (AP). AP are used up by moving around the battlefield. Units can perform one of six actions, with two actions per turn as in earlier titles.<ref name=\"SakuraVgameplay\"/><ref name=\"SW3gameplay2\"/><ref name=\"Sakura4Gameplay1\"/> Each unit has special abilities, and attack ranges based on their weaponry.<ref name=\"SakuraGameplayMag\"/><ref name=\"Sakura2Gameplay1\"/><ref name=\"SakuraVgameplay\"/><ref name=\"SW3gameplay2\"/> For the 2019 ''Sakura Wars'', the battle system was redesigned to use action-based combat, focusing on free movement within large arenas.<ref name=\"Sakura2019battleA\"/><ref name=\"Sakura2019battleB\"/>\n\nCentral to all the games and most spin-off titles is the \"Live & Interactive Picture System\" (LIPS). During conversations with characters and key story sections, the player is faced with critical choices with an imposed time limit.<ref name=\"4Gsakura\"/><ref name=\"SakuraMobile4\"/><ref name=\"RPGprojectSakura\"/><ref name=\"SakuraDSinfo\"/> The concept behind LIPS was to maintain player engagement while making narrative rather than freezing time and allowing prolonged time for thought, a trend the staff found annoying.{{sfn|Mainichi|2003|p=343\u2013344}} The most basic version was established in the first ''Sakura Wars'',<ref name=\"SakuraDocumentary\"/> then later expanded into \"Double LIPS\" with the incorporation of a personality meter which could indicate a character's feelings towards the player.<ref name=\"Sakura2Guide\"/> Between ''Is Paris Burning?'' and ''So Long, My Love'', a version called \"Analog LIPS\" was used. This allowed players to alter the intensity of a single response. It also included interacting with the character and environments.<ref name=\"SW3gameplay1\"/><ref name=\"Sakura4Manual\"/><ref name=\"SakuraVPreview\"/> ''So Long, My Love'' expanded it further with [[quick time event|quick time events]] using the control sticks and buttons.<ref name=\"SakuraVgameplay\"/> The 2019 ''Sakura Wars'' continues this use of the LIPS system, featuring Analog LIPS and new free-roaming elements.<ref name=\"ShinSakuraManual\"/> Choices made during LIPS sections directly impact character performance in battle.<ref name=\"SakuraOverview\"/><ref name=\"ShinSakuraManual\"/>\n\n==History==\n===Origins and development===\nIn 1990, [[Oji Hiroi]] at [[Red Entertainment]] (formally Red Company) decided to create ''Sakura Wars''. Hiroi drew inspiration from Japanese stage shows when creating the project, initially titled {{Nihongo|\"''Sakura''\"|\u685c|}}.<ref name=\"SakuraMangaHiroi\"/>{{sfn|Mainichi|2003|p=343\u2013344}}<ref name=\"SSMinterview2\"/> Because of lack of interest from publishers, Hiroi shelved the project until he was approached by [[Sega]] vice president [[Shoichiro Irimajiri]] to develop a new project for the Saturn. Successfully pitching his project to Irimajiri, the game began production under the title ''Sakura Wars''.<ref name=\"SakuraRomantica\"/><ref name=\"SakuraMangaHiroi\"/><ref name=\"SakuraGC\"/> While the scenario and gameplay went through multiple redrafts, ''Sakura Wars'' always made use of a steampunk setting, a female lead and [[mecha]] combat.{{sfn|Mainichi|2003|p=343\u2013344}}<ref name=\"SSMinterview2\"/> Development lasted three years, double the original estimate, and was Sega's most expensive project at the time.{{sfn|Mainichi|2003|p=343\u2013344}}<ref name=\"SakuraDocumentary\"/><ref name=\"SSMinterviewMusic\"/> Many within both Red Company and Sega were sceptical of the game's success, but Hiroi remained confident.{{sfn|Everyday|2000|p=180}} Following the critical and commercial success of ''Sakura Wars'', Sega and Red Company expanded the original premise into a franchise, starting with ''Thou Shalt Not Die''.<ref name=\"SakuraDocumentary\"/><ref name=\"Sakura2Guide\"/> A recurring feature from ''Thou Shalt Not Die'' onwards was the use of subtitles drawn from famous poetry or other types of fiction related to a game's location or mood. A recurring poet was [[Akiko Yosano]], whom Hiroi admired.<ref name=\"Sakura2Guide\"/><ref name=\"SakuraColdInterview\"/><ref name=\"ITMsakuraInterview\"/>\n\nFollowing ''Thou Shalt Not Die'', the team moved onto the Dreamcast to develop ''Sakura Wars 3'', rebuilding the game engine and utilising the console's functions for gameplay elements.<ref name=\"Sakura3Info\"/> Following the release of ''Sakura Wars 3'', Sega discontinued the Dreamcast due to declining console sales, transitioning to a software developer and publisher. Rather than move their planned next entry to the PlayStation 2, the team created a final Dreamcast entry as a celebratory title for series fans.<ref name=\"Sakura4Origins\"/><ref name=\"Sakura4Info\"/> This became ''Sakura Wars 4'', which was completed in 10 months as opposed to the usual two year development period of other entries.<ref name=\"Sakura4Steam\"/> The original story planned for ''Sakura Wars 4'' was moved for the team's next entry on the PlayStation 2.<ref name=\"Sakura4Origins\"/>\n\nIn 2005, Red Entertainment split from Sega after it bought back its majority share holding, although it continued to be involved in the ''Sakura Wars'' series.<ref name=\"RedSplitA\"/> The next entry, ''Sakura Wars V'', formed part of a seven-game group dubbed \"Sakura Wars World Project\"; the aim was to release these games overseas.<ref name=\"SakuraWorldAnnounced\"/> In the event, only ''Sakura Wars V'' was published overseas as ''Sakura Wars: So Long, My Love'', and only three of the other planned games were released.<ref name=\"SakuraOverview\"/> The remaining three titles were cancelled in 2008.<ref name=\"FamCancelled\"/> Sega and Red Entertainment [[Green-light|greenlit]] ''Dramatic Dungeon: Sakura Wars'' in an attempt to revitalise the franchise using a new gameplay genre.<ref name=\"ITMsakuraInterview\"/> In August 2008, Sega decided to end the franchise, with the final ''Sakura Wars''-themed event being a concert that month.<ref name=\"TanakaBlog\"/> Red Entertainment was bought by Chinese company UltaZen in 2011, with Sega retaining the ''Sakura Wars'' property.<ref name=\"RedSplitB\"/><ref name=\"RedSplitC\"/> Fan demand eventually persuaded Sega to greenlight a new title in the series, which would both continue the narrative and feature a new cast.<ref name=\"FamInterviewShin\"/>\n\n===Staff===\nAll titles from 1996 to 2005 were developed by the same central team. These included writer [[Satoru Akahori]], artists [[K\u014dsuke Fujishima]] and [[Hidenori Matsubara]], director and later chief director Tomoyuki Ito, producer and later executive producer [[Noriyoshi Ohba]], and designer Takaharu Terada. Hiroi had contributed to all the projects as a general producer.<ref name=\"SegaSakuraInterview\"/><ref name=\"SakuraV0interview\"/><ref name=\"SakuraRedOverview\"/><ref name=\"Sakura2Guide\"/><ref name=\"Sakura3Interviews\"/><ref name=\"RPGFinfo\"/> Red Entertainment co-developed the games with an internal Sega team which shifted identity over the years\u2014originally known as CS2 R&D during development of the first two ''Sakura Wars'', the team was renamed [[Sega AM1|Overworks]] in 2000 when Sega consolidated its 9 semi-autonomous subsidiaries into six studios; they worked on the series between ''Sakura Wars 3'' and ''Sakura Wars V: Episode 0''.<ref name=\"OverworksHistory\"/><ref name=\"SegaOverworks\"/><ref name=\"SakuraV0infoSega\"/> ''Sakura Wars: So Long, My Love'' was developed by the same team as part of Sega's GE2 R&D division, the same team which would develop ''[[Valkyria Chronicles (video game)|Valkyria Chronicles]]''.<ref name=\"SakuraVStaff\"/><ref name=\"SakuraValkyria\"/> The 2019 ''Sakura Wars'' was developed by a team within Sega's CS2 R&D division, a newer group including [[Sonic Team]].<ref name=\"ProjectSakuraProduction\"/> New team members included character designer [[Tite Kubo]], and writers [[Jiro Ishii]] and Takaaki Suzuki, all famous names in anime and video games respectively. Hiroi remained in a supervisory role, and also wrote the theme song lyrics.<ref name=\"ProjectSakura\"/><ref name=\"RPGprojectSakura\"/>\n\nOther developers worked on the series alongside Sega and Red Entertainment, including [[Idea Factory]], who created the Wii port of ''So Long, My Love'';<ref name=\"IdeaWii\"/> [[Jupiter Corporation]], producers of the ''Sakura Wars GB'' duology and the ''Pocket Sakura'' peripheral;<ref name=\"SakuraGB1\"/><ref name=\"SakuraGB2\"/><ref name=\"PocketSakura\"/> and [[Neverland (company)|Neverland]], who developed ''Dramatic Dungeon: Sakura Wars''.<ref name=\"SakuraNeverland\"/> A notable feature of the series is its FMV anime sequences.<ref name=\"SakuraDocumentary\"/> The first game's scenes were animated by Sega's animation subsidiary, Kyokuichi Tokyo Movie (now known as [[TMS Entertainment]]).<ref name=\"SakuraStaff\"/><ref name=\"TMShistory\"/> From ''Thou Shalt Not Die'' to ''Fall in Love, Maidens'', they were produced by [[Production I.G]].<ref name=\"Sakura4Dorimanga\"/> For ''So Long, My Love'', the scenes were primarily produced by M.S.C.<ref name=\"SakuraVanime\"/><ref name=\"SakuraVStaff\"/> In the 2019 ''Sakura Wars'', the anime FMV sequences were produced by [[Sanzigen]].<ref name=\"GemComments\"/>\n\n===Music===\nThe ''Sakura Wars'' series features a variety of music, and frequently reuses themes. [[Kohei Tanaka (composer)|Kohei Tanaka]] is the chief [[composer|music composer]] of the series. Tanaka's first major work in the video game industry, it brought him widespread recognition.<ref name=\"TanakaSakura\"/> Tanaka was among the first to support Hiroi with ''Sakura Wars'', having worked with him during work on an [[original video animation]] (OVA) of ''[[Tengai Makyou: Ziria]]''. Tanaka acted as a teacher figure for the rest of the development team.<ref name=\"SSMinterview2\"/><ref name=\"SSMinterview\"/><ref name=\"SakuraSide\"/> At that time, rhythm and percussion dominated Japanese popular music rather than melody. Both Tanaka and Hiroi wanted to reintroduce younger Japanese to beautiful melodies.<ref name=\"SakuraCompleteSong\"/> Tanaka has been involved to some degree in most of the ''Sakura Wars'' games, composing the music for all mainline entries, and several spin-off titles.<ref name=\"SakuraOverview\"/><ref name=\"SakuraDSinfo\"/><ref name=\"SakuraCompleteSong\"/> A recurring theme in the series is a piece called \"Geki! Teikoku Kagekidan\".{{sfn|Enterbrain|2000|p=138}} Tanaka wrote the theme based on Hiroi's request to combine the music of a ''[[Super Sentai]]'' opening theme with the vocal style of the title song for the film ''[[Aoi sanmyaku]]'' (1949).<ref name=\"SSMinterview3\"/> Versions of it were included in ''Sakura Wars 2'', ''Sakura Wars 4'', and the 2019 soft reboot of ''Sakura Wars''.<ref name=\"ProjectSakura\"/><ref name=\"Sakura4Dorimanga\"/><ref name=\"SakuraCompleteSong\"/>\n\n===Localization===\nWhile Hiroi wanted the series to be released internationally, nearly all games in the ''Sakura Wars'' series remain exclusive to Asian territories.<ref name=\"RPGinterview\"/> Early efforts at localizing the series were not undertaken because of Sega's uncertainty over whether the game's blend of genres would find a large enough audience outside Japan to be profitable.<ref name=\"SakuraLocalReason\"/> An unspecified attempt by Sega to localize the game stalled during the concept approval stage for unknown reasons.<ref name=\"SakuraVvoices\"/> Attempts by an unknown company to localise the PSP port of ''Sakura Wars'' and its sequel were halted as Sony did not give its approval to the project. This was because Sony classified ''Sakura Wars'' as a text novel, making future licensing for importation and translation difficult.<ref name=\"NISinterview\"/>\n\nA [[Korean language|Korean]] translation of ''So Long, My Love'' was published in [[South Korea]] by Sega in 2006.<ref name=\"SakuraVKorea\"/> The PC CD-ROM versions of ''Sakura Wars'' and its sequel were localized and released in [[Russia]] by [[Akella]] in 2006 and 2008 respectively.<ref name=\"SakuraRussia1\"/><ref name=\"SakuraRussia2\"/> Dysin Interactive published the PC versions of ''Sakura Wars'' to ''Sakura Wars 3'' in China,<ref name=\"SakuraPCChin\"/><ref name=\"Sakura3Chin\"/> and ''Sakura Wars 4'' was released in the region by Beijing Entertainment All Technology.<ref name=\"Sakura4ChinA\"/><ref name=\"Sakura4ChinB\"/>\n\nThe first official English release in the ''Sakura Wars'' series is ''So Long, My Love'', which was translated by NIS America in collaboration with Red Entertainment and [[Idea Factory]].<ref name=\"RPGinterview\"/> The dub was produced at [[Bang Zoom! Entertainment]], and included actors from NIS America's localization of the ''[[Disgaea]]'' series.<ref name=\"SakuraVlocalInterview2\"/><ref name=\"SakuraWii\"/> The team also included the Japanese voice track in the PlayStation 2 version, with a dedicated translation which preserved the original character names being created for it.<ref name=\"SakuraVvoices\"/><ref name=\"SakuraVvoices2\"/> The localization took two years to complete, becoming NIS America's largest localization effort to date.<ref name=\"NISinterview\"/><ref name=\"SakuraWii\"/> For the 2019 reboot, Sega brought on ''[[Yakuza 0]]'' translators Inbound Games to localise the game.<ref name=\"Sakura2020Local\"/> The international version uses the Japanese dub with subtitles in other languages.<ref name=\"ProjectSakura\"/>\n\n==Reception and sales==\nBetween the series' debut in 1996 and 2010, the series has sold over 4.5 million copies worldwide.<ref name=\"SakuraRedOverview\"/> Each entry on Sega hardware rank among the best-selling titles for their respective hardware.<ref name=\"SakuraSaturnSales\"/><ref name=\"SakuraDreamSales\"/> The original ''Sakura Wars'' was an immediate success, with several stores being sold out of copies within hours of its release.<ref name=\"SakuraDocumentary\"/> ''Sakura Wars 2'' remains the best-selling title in the series, with over 500,000 copies sold on the Saturn alone, making it one of the console's best-selling titles in Japan.<ref name=\"SakuraSaturnSales\"/><ref name=\"FamSales\"/> ''So Long, My Love'' is the worst-selling mainline entry to date,<ref name=\"FamSales\"/> and was a commercial failure in the West.<ref name=\"NISinterview\"/>\n\nJapanese website [[4Gamer.net]] described the series as a \"legendary\" property connected to Sega, citing several elements such as the anime-style presentation and blend of genres that were hardly seen in gaming at the time.<ref name=\"4Gsakura\"/> Jenni Lada of TechnologyTell wrote a retrospective on the series in 2009, calling ''Sakura Wars'' \"an odd series [...] that defies genres\".<ref name=\"SakuraOverview\"/> In a 1999 [[IGN]] article on the franchise following the announcement of ''Sakura Wars 3'', journalist Anoop Gantayat described it as \"probably the greatest series of games to never make their way stateside\", citing its unprecedented success when compared to other games on Sega hardware at the time.<ref name=\"SakuraIGNretro\"/>\n\nThe series has been popular with both journalists and fans in Japan since the first game's release.<ref name=\"SakuraDocumentary\"/> At the inaugural [[Japan Game Awards|CESA Awards]], ''Sakura Wars'' won the Grand Award, as well as awards in the Best Director, Best Main Character and Best Supporting Character categories.<ref name=\"CESAawards\"/> ''Sakura Wars 2'' won the [[Animation Kobe#Packaged Work Award|Packaged Work Award]] at the 1998 [[Animation Kobe]] event.<ref name=\"Sakura2Award\"/> The soundtrack album of ''Sakura Wars 4''  won in the \"Animation \u2013 Album of the Year\" category at the 2003 [[Japan Gold Disc Award]]s.<ref name=\"Sakura4Award\"/> Prior to release, ''Sakura Wars'' was the second most-wanted game in a ''Famitsu'' poll in 1996, coming in behind ''[[Final Fantasy VII]]''.<ref name=\"SakuraIGNretro\"/> The first four games all appeared on a public ''Famitsu'' poll from 2006 of the 100 best games of all time.<ref name=\"SakuraRating2006\"/> A second later poll ranked the ''Sakura Wars'' games as among the best on the Saturn and Dreamcast.<ref name=\"KotakuSakura\"/> ''Sakura Wars'' heroine Sakura Shinguji was rated in 2009 by ''Famitsu'' as the 17th best Japanese video game character.<ref name=\"FamPoll1UP\"/>\n\n==Related media==\n[[File:sakura-taisen-cafe.jpg|thumb|upright|right|The ''Sakura Wars'' series met with considerable success, spawning a multimedia franchise and having its own themed cafe between 1998 and 2008.<ref name=\"SakuraStore\"/>|alt=A view through a doorway into a cafe area; a sign reads Sakura Cafe and the interior is decorated using wood panelling with red and gold elements.]]\nRed Company and Sega have expanded the ''Sakura Wars'' series into various media.<ref name=\"SakuraDocumentary\"/> These include anime, manga, stage shows, several [[light novel]]s, concerts and CD album releases of soundtracks. The latter have met with substantial commercial success.<ref name=\"SakuraMedia\"/><ref name=\"SakuraMediaSales\"/> Despite a shared identity, Hiroi took care to keep each of these elements distinct and separate from each other.<ref name=\"ATsakuraInterview\"/> A dedicated themed cafe and merchandise store based in the [[Ikebukuro]] district of Tokyo, ''Sakura Wars Taisho Romando'', opened in 1998. ''Taisho Romando'' remained open for ten years until it closed in March 2008.<ref name=\"SakuraStore\"/>\n\nA prominent feature was an annual stage show dubbed ''Sakura Wars Kayou Show'' supervised by Hiroi, for which new musical numbers were created by Tanaka.<ref name=\"SakuraMedia\"/><ref name=\"SakuraStageTanaka\"/> The show featured the cast reprising their roles and performing stage shows drawn from the series. Each character had songs themed after their characters.<ref name=\"4Gsakura\"/><ref name=\"SakuraMedia\"/><ref name=\"SakuraStageCast\"/> The cast, which grew to include those of later games, remained for the entire run with the exception of actress [[Michie Tomizawa]] who retired from the series and her role as character Sumire Kanzaki in 2002.<ref name=\"SakuraStageSumire\"/><ref name=\"SakuraTomizawa\"/> Tomizawa appeared as a guest in later revival concerts.<ref name=\"SakuraStageRevive1\"/><ref name=\"SakuraStageSumire\"/> The original stage shows ran regularly from 1997 to 2006.<ref name=\"SakuraMedia\"/><ref name=\"SakuraStageCast\"/> Since then, it has seen irregular revivals with both the first cast and later additions.<ref name=\"SakuraMedia\"/><ref name=\"SakuraStageRevive1\"/><ref name=\"SakuraRevive2\"/><ref name=\"SakuraStageRevive3\"/> The stage shows were originally meant to end in 2008 along with the franchise, but fan support allowed future revivals.<ref name=\"TanakaBlog\"/> A new stage play based on the 2019 game will premier in March 2020.<ref name=\"ShinSakuraStage\"/>\n\nHiroi wrote a manga adaptation of the first ''Sakura Wars'', which began serialization in 2002. The original run finished in December 2008, but its popularity led to a second series continuing the narrative.<ref name=\"SakuraMangaA\"/><ref name=\"SakuraMangaB\"/> Since 2003, the manga has been published as [[tank\u014dbon]] by [[Kodansha]].<ref name=\"SakuraMangaKodansha1\"/><ref name=\"SakuraMangaKodansha2\"/> A comedy manga titled ''Sakura Wars: Show Theater'', which featured comedy skits of characters from each main ''Sakura Wars'' location, was serialised between 2005 and 2009, and published by Kodansha in four volumes between 2006 and 2009.<ref name=\"SakuraMangaTheater\"/> A manga adaptation of the 2019 game, ''Shin Sakura Taisen: The Comic'', began serialization in 2019 by [[Shueisha]]. It was written by Ishii, and illustrated by Koyuri Noguchi.<ref name=\"ShinSakuraManga\"/>\n\nA spin-off manga ''Sakura Wars: Kanadegumi'' was created by Chie Shimada, based on concepts from the ''Sakura Wars'' team, and published in the shojo magazine ''[[Hana to Yume]]'' published by [[Hakusensha]].<ref name=\"SakuraKanade1\"/> In contrast to the main series, it was aimed at a female audience and shifted the narrative to a male harem set-up; main protagonist Neko Miyabi is assigned to the titular Kanadagumi, and develops relationships with its five male members.<ref name=\"SakuraKanade1\"/> Originally a two-chapter special published between November and December 2011,<ref name=\"SakuraKanade1\"/> it was expanded into a full series in February 2012.<ref name=\"SakuraKanade2\"/> The manga ran from 2012 to 2013.

The OVA was released as four 30-minute episodes from 1997 to 1998, following the cast of the first game.<ref name=\"Sakura1OVA\"/> A second OVA series, ''[[Sakura Wars: The Radiant Gorgeous Blooming Cherry Blossoms|The Radiant Gorgeous Blooming Cherry Blossoms]]'', was released as six 30-minute episodes from 1999 to 2000, relating side stories from between ''Sakura Wars'' and the end of ''Thou Shalt Not Die''.<ref name=\"Sakura2OVAa\"/><ref name=\"Sakura2OVAb\"/> Further OVA series based around the characters of ''Is Paris Burning?'' and ''So Long, My Love'' (''\u00c9cole de Paris''; ''Le Nouveau Paris''; ''Sumire''; ''New York, New York'') were released from 2003 to 2007.<ref name=\"Sakura3OVA1\"/><ref name=\"Sakura3OVA2\"/><ref name=\"SakuraSumire\"/><ref name=\"SakuraVova\"/> The OVAs were produced by [[Radix Ace Entertainment]] until ''New York, New York'' in 2007, when production shifted by [[Anime International Company]].<ref name=\"Sakura1OVA\"/><ref name=\"Sakura2OVAa\"/><ref name=\"SakuraSumire\"/><ref name=\"SakuraVova\"/>\n\nAn [[Sakura Wars (TV series)|anime television series]] based on the first game was co-produced by Red Company, [[Madhouse (company)|Madhouse]] and Studio Matrix. The 25-episode series was broadcast on the [[Tokyo Broadcasting System]] from April 8 to September 23, 2000.<ref name=\"SakuraWhatsB\"/> While based on the first game's narrative and preserving Hiroi's vision, the series changed and added in several events. A major problem was remaining faithful to the source material within a TV format.<ref name=\"OjiInterviewSWanimeB\"/> In 2001, an animated theatrical film, ''[[Sakura Wars: The Movie]]'', was released. The film takes place between ''Is Paris Burning?'' and ''Fall in Love, Maidens'' and features new character Ratchet Altair who would later appear in ''So Long, My Love''.<ref name=\"SakuraVGuidebook\"/><ref name=\"ASCIIproduction\"/><ref name=\"SakuraReleaseInfo\"/> The film was animated by Production I.G; production took three years and was inspired by the wish to expand the series animation beyond what the short cutscenes and OVA projects had achieved.<ref name=\"SakuraMovieInterview\"/> A second anime television series, titled ''Sakura Wars the Animation'' and serving as a sequel to the 2019 ''Sakura Wars'', is scheduled to premiere on April 3, 2020.

It is focused around a series of [[cross-genre]] video games. The [[Sakura Wars (1996 video game)|first game in the series]] was released in 1996, with five sequels and numerous spin-off titles being released since then. The series\u2014set during a fictionalized version of the [[Taish\u014d period]]\u2014depicts groups of women with magical abilities using steam-powered [[mecha]] to combat demonic threats.\n\nThe original ''Sakura Wars'' was an ambitious title for the then-in-production [[Sega Saturn]]. The first game's overlap of the [[Tactical role-playing game|tactical role-playing]], [[dating sim]] and [[visual novel]] genres prompted Sega to classify it as a \"dramatic adventure\", a moniker which has endured during the series' lifetime. Both Red Entertainment and Sega co-developed most of the games until 2008, when the series went on hiatus. Sega rebooted the series as sole developer due to fan demand. Recurring elements include anime cutscenes created by notable studios including [[Production I.G]], and music by composer [[Kohei Tanaka (composer)|Kohei Tanaka]].\n\nThe series has sold over 4.5 million copies as of 2010, and garnered both critical and popular acclaim. The original Sega console games have been voted among the most popular for the Saturn and Dreamcast. The ''Sakura Wars'' franchise includes numerous [[anime]] productions, manga, and other media projects such as stage shows.

A sequel for Dreamcast released in 2000.<ref name=\"SakuraSeriesIndex\"/><ref name=\"4Gsakura\"/> A spin-off set just after ''Sakura Wars'' for the [[Game Boy Color]], ''Sakura Wars GB'', released in 2000.

While a few men are capable of using them, women form the main combat units due to their stronger spiritual power. This group is known as the Imperial Assault Force, based in a theater and working undercover as the Imperial Theater Revue.<ref name=\"SakuraOverview\"/><ref name=\"4Gsakura\"/> The group to which the protagonists belong is the Flower Division (Hanagumi), the main combat troop. Other groups make cameo appearances in the story if present.<ref name=\"ProjectSakura\"/><ref name=\"SakuraOverview\"/><ref name=\"SakuraRedOverview\"/>\n\nThe first four games follow the military and romantic exploits of Imperial Army officer Ichiro Ogami. Originally assigned to the Imperial Assault Force in Tokyo, he later traveled to Paris and trained the newly-formed Paris Assault Force before returning to Tokyo and commanding the two united Flower Divisions during the events of ''Sakura Wars 4''.<ref name=\"4Gsakura\"/><ref name=\"Sakura4Info\"/> For ''So Long, My Love'', the lead protagonist was changed to Ogami's nephew Shinjiro Taiga, who is sent in place of Ogami to train the New York Combat Revue.<ref name=\"SakuraVinfo\"/> The 2019 soft reboot of ''Sakura Wars'' takes place in 1940, twelve years after an event called the \"Great Demon War\" saw the destruction of all three original Flower Divisions. New divisions were created across the world and began competing with each other, with the newly-reformed Tokyo Flower Division being the main protagonists.<ref name=\"ProjectSakura\"/>\n\n===Gameplay===\nThe gameplay of ''Sakura Wars'' incorporate [[Role-playing video game|role-playing]], [[dating sim]] and [[visual novel]] elements.<ref name=\"SakuraOverview\"/><ref name=\"Sakura2019battleA\"/> This blend of genres and styles resulted in it being labeled as a new genre dubbed \"dramatic adventure\" in its marketing.<ref name=\"SSMinterviewDrama\"/> The original combination of narrative and [[Tactical role-playing game|tactical role-playing ]] gameplay was inspired by the ''[[Fire Emblem]]'' series.{{sfn|Mainichi|2003|p=343\u2013344}} The gameplay is split between adventure-style segments where the player explores environments and interacts with cast members; and battle sections where choices during the adventure segments come into play. With the main female cast, the protagonist can pursue a romance.<ref name=\"SakuraOverview\"/> Romance options can be carried between the first four titles using save data.<ref name=\"Sakura4Gameplay2\"/>\n\nThroughout the series, the games have used different battle systems. The first ''Sakura Wars'' and its sequel made use of a traditional [[Turn-based strategy|turn-based battle system]] on a tilted two-dimensional grid-based battlefield. Each unit has two actions from a selection of five.<ref name=\"SakuraGameplayMag\"/><ref name=\"SakuraGameplay\"/> The sequel expanded the selection to six, and included cinematic attacks. The leader could also issue commands to the entire squad to take specific battle formations.<ref name=\"Sakura2Gameplay1\"/><ref name=\"Sakura2Gameplay2\"/> ''Sakura Wars 3'' introduced the \"Active & Realtime Machine System\" (ARMS), which takes place in three-dimensional battle arenas. Under this system, units have an allotment of Action Points (AP). AP are used up by moving around the battlefield. Units can perform one of six actions, with two actions per turn as in earlier titles.<ref name=\"SakuraVgameplay\"/><ref name=\"SW3gameplay2\"/><ref name=\"Sakura4Gameplay1\"/> Each unit has special abilities, and attack ranges based on their weaponry.<ref name=\"SakuraGameplayMag\"/><ref name=\"Sakura2Gameplay1\"/><ref name=\"SakuraVgameplay\"/><ref name=\"SW3gameplay2\"/> For the 2019 ''Sakura Wars'', the battle system was redesigned to use action-based combat, focusing on free movement within large arenas.<ref name=\"Sakura2019battleA\"/><ref name=\"Sakura2019battleB\"/>\n\nCentral to all the games and most spin-off titles is the \"Live & Interactive Picture System\" (LIPS). During conversations with characters and key story sections, the player is faced with critical choices with an imposed time limit.<ref name=\"4Gsakura\"/><ref name=\"SakuraMobile4\"/><ref name=\"RPGprojectSakura\"/><ref name=\"SakuraDSinfo\"/> The concept behind LIPS was to maintain player engagement while making narrative rather than freezing time and allowing prolonged time for thought, a trend the staff found annoying.{{sfn|Mainichi|2003|p=343\u2013344}} The most basic version was established in the first ''Sakura Wars'',<ref name=\"SakuraDocumentary\"/> then later expanded into \"Double LIPS\" with the incorporation of a personality meter which could indicate a character's feelings towards the player.<ref name=\"Sakura2Guide\"/> Between ''Is Paris Burning?'' and ''So Long, My Love'', a version called \"Analog LIPS\" was used. This allowed players to alter the intensity of a single response. It also included interacting with the character and environments.<ref name=\"SW3gameplay1\"/><ref name=\"Sakura4Manual\"/><ref name=\"SakuraVPreview\"/> ''So Long, My Love'' expanded it further with [[quick time event|quick time events]] using the control sticks and buttons.<ref name=\"SakuraVgameplay\"/> The 2019 ''Sakura Wars'' continues this use of the LIPS system, featuring Analog LIPS and new free-roaming elements.<ref name=\"ShinSakuraManual\"/> Choices made during LIPS sections directly impact character performance in battle.<ref name=\"SakuraOverview\"/><ref name=\"ShinSakuraManual\"/>\n\n==History==\n===Origins and development===\nIn 1990, [[Oji Hiroi]] at [[Red Entertainment]] (formally Red Company) decided to create ''Sakura Wars''. Hiroi drew inspiration from Japanese stage shows when creating the project, initially titled {{Nihongo|\"''Sakura''\"|\u685c|}}.<ref name=\"SakuraMangaHiroi\"/>{{sfn|Mainichi|2003|p=343\u2013344}}<ref name=\"SSMinterview2\"/> Because of lack of interest from publishers, Hiroi shelved the project until he was approached by [[Sega]] vice president [[Shoichiro Irimajiri]] to develop a new project for the Saturn. Successfully pitching his project to Irimajiri, the game began production under the title ''Sakura Wars''.<ref name=\"SakuraRomantica\"/><ref name=\"SakuraMangaHiroi\"/><ref name=\"SakuraGC\"/> While the scenario and gameplay went through multiple redrafts, ''Sakura Wars'' always made use of a steampunk setting, a female lead and [[mecha]] combat.{{sfn|Mainichi|2003|p=343\u2013344}}<ref name=\"SSMinterview2\"/> Development lasted three years, double the original estimate, and was Sega's most expensive project at the time.{{sfn|Mainichi|2003|p=343\u2013344}}<ref name=\"SakuraDocumentary\"/><ref name=\"SSMinterviewMusic\"/> Many within both Red Company and Sega were sceptical of the game's success, but Hiroi remained confident.{{sfn|Everyday|2000|p=180}} Following the critical and commercial success of ''Sakura Wars'', Sega and Red Company expanded the original premise into a franchise, starting with ''Thou Shalt Not Die''.<ref name=\"SakuraDocumentary\"/><ref name=\"Sakura2Guide\"/> A recurring feature from ''Thou Shalt Not Die'' onwards was the use of subtitles drawn from famous poetry or other types of fiction related to a game's location or mood. A recurring poet was [[Akiko Yosano]], whom Hiroi admired.<ref name=\"Sakura2Guide\"/><ref name=\"SakuraColdInterview\"/><ref name=\"ITMsakuraInterview\"/>\n\nFollowing ''Thou Shalt Not Die'', the team moved onto the Dreamcast to develop ''Sakura Wars 3'', rebuilding the game engine and utilising the console's functions for gameplay elements.<ref name=\"Sakura3Info\"/> Following the release of ''Sakura Wars 3'', Sega discontinued the Dreamcast due to declining console sales, transitioning to a software developer and publisher. Rather than move their planned next entry to the PlayStation 2, the team created a final Dreamcast entry as a celebratory title for series fans.<ref name=\"Sakura4Origins\"/><ref name=\"Sakura4Info\"/> This became ''Sakura Wars 4'', which was completed in 10 months as opposed to the usual two year development period of other entries.<ref name=\"Sakura4Steam\"/> The original story planned for ''Sakura Wars 4'' was moved for the team's next entry on the PlayStation 2.<ref name=\"Sakura4Origins\"/>\n\nIn 2005, Red Entertainment split from Sega after it bought back its majority share holding, although it continued to be involved in the ''Sakura Wars'' series.<ref name=\"RedSplitA\"/> The next entry, ''Sakura Wars V'', formed part of a seven-game group dubbed \"Sakura Wars World Project\"; the aim was to release these games overseas.<ref name=\"SakuraWorldAnnounced\"/> In the event, only ''Sakura Wars V'' was published overseas as ''Sakura Wars: So Long, My Love'', and only three of the other planned games were released.<ref name=\"SakuraOverview\"/> The remaining three titles were cancelled in 2008.<ref name=\"FamCancelled\"/> Sega and Red Entertainment [[Green-light|greenlit]] ''Dramatic Dungeon: Sakura Wars'' in an attempt to revitalise the franchise using a new gameplay genre.<ref name=\"ITMsakuraInterview\"/> In August 2008, Sega decided to end the franchise, with the final ''Sakura Wars''-themed event being a concert that month.<ref name=\"TanakaBlog\"/> Red Entertainment was bought by Chinese company UltaZen in 2011, with Sega retaining the ''Sakura Wars'' property.<ref name=\"RedSplitB\"/><ref name=\"RedSplitC\"/> Fan demand eventually persuaded Sega to greenlight a new title in the series, which would both continue the narrative and feature a new cast.<ref name=\"FamInterviewShin\"/>\n\n===Staff===\nAll titles from 1996 to 2005 were developed by the same central team. These included writer [[Satoru Akahori]], artists [[K\u014dsuke Fujishima]] and [[Hidenori Matsubara]], director and later chief director Tomoyuki Ito, producer and later executive producer [[Noriyoshi Ohba]], and designer Takaharu Terada. Hiroi had contributed to all the projects as a general producer.<ref name=\"SegaSakuraInterview\"/><ref name=\"SakuraV0interview\"/><ref name=\"SakuraRedOverview\"/><ref name=\"Sakura2Guide\"/><ref name=\"Sakura3Interviews\"/><ref name=\"RPGFinfo\"/> Red Entertainment co-developed the games with an internal Sega team which shifted identity over the years\u2014originally known as CS2 R&D during development of the first two ''Sakura Wars'', the team was renamed [[Sega AM1|Overworks]] in 2000 when Sega consolidated its 9 semi-autonomous subsidiaries into six studios; they worked on the series between ''Sakura Wars 3'' and ''Sakura Wars V: Episode 0''.<ref name=\"OverworksHistory\"/><ref name=\"SegaOverworks\"/><ref name=\"SakuraV0infoSega\"/> ''Sakura Wars: So Long, My Love'' was developed by the same team as part of Sega's GE2 R&D division, the same team which would develop ''[[Valkyria Chronicles (video game)|Valkyria Chronicles]]''.<ref name=\"SakuraVStaff\"/><ref name=\"SakuraValkyria\"/> The 2019 ''Sakura Wars'' was developed by a team within Sega's CS2 R&D division, a newer group including [[Sonic Team]].<ref name=\"ProjectSakuraProduction\"/> New team members included character designer [[Tite Kubo]], and writers [[Jiro Ishii]] and Takaaki Suzuki, all famous names in anime and video games respectively. Hiroi remained in a supervisory role, and also wrote the theme song lyrics.<ref name=\"ProjectSakura\"/><ref name=\"RPGprojectSakura\"/>\n\nOther developers worked on the series alongside Sega and Red Entertainment, including [[Idea Factory]], who created the Wii port of ''So Long, My Love'';<ref name=\"IdeaWii\"/> [[Jupiter Corporation]], producers of the ''Sakura Wars GB'' duology and the ''Pocket Sakura'' peripheral;<ref name=\"SakuraGB1\"/><ref name=\"SakuraGB2\"/><ref name=\"PocketSakura\"/> and [[Neverland (company)|Neverland]], who developed ''Dramatic Dungeon: Sakura Wars''.<ref name=\"SakuraNeverland\"/> A notable feature of the series is its FMV anime sequences.<ref name=\"SakuraDocumentary\"/> The first game's scenes were animated by Sega's animation subsidiary, Kyokuichi Tokyo Movie (now known as [[TMS Entertainment]]).<ref name=\"SakuraStaff\"/><ref name=\"TMShistory\"/> From ''Thou Shalt Not Die'' to ''Fall in Love, Maidens'', they were produced by [[Production I.G]].<ref name=\"Sakura4Dorimanga\"/> For ''So Long, My Love'', the scenes were primarily produced by M.S.C.<ref name=\"SakuraVanime\"/><ref name=\"SakuraVStaff\"/> In the 2019 ''Sakura Wars'', the anime FMV sequences were produced by [[Sanzigen]].<ref name=\"GemComments\"/>\n\n===Music===\nThe ''Sakura Wars'' series features a variety of music, and frequently reuses themes. [[Kohei Tanaka (composer)|Kohei Tanaka]] is the chief [[composer|music composer]] of the series. Tanaka's first major work in the video game industry, it brought him widespread recognition.<ref name=\"TanakaSakura\"/> Tanaka was among the first to support Hiroi with ''Sakura Wars'', having worked with him during work on an [[original video animation]] (OVA) of ''[[Tengai Makyou: Ziria]]''. Tanaka acted as a teacher figure for the rest of the development team.<ref name=\"SSMinterview2\"/><ref name=\"SSMinterview\"/><ref name=\"SakuraSide\"/> At that time, rhythm and percussion dominated Japanese popular music rather than melody. Both Tanaka and Hiroi wanted to reintroduce younger Japanese to beautiful melodies.<ref name=\"SakuraCompleteSong\"/> Tanaka has been involved to some degree in most of the ''Sakura Wars'' games, composing the music for all mainline entries, and several spin-off titles.<ref name=\"SakuraOverview\"/><ref name=\"SakuraDSinfo\"/><ref name=\"SakuraCompleteSong\"/> A recurring theme in the series is a piece called \"Geki! Teikoku Kagekidan\".{{sfn|Enterbrain|2000|p=138}} Tanaka wrote the theme based on Hiroi's request to combine the music of a ''[[Super Sentai]]'' opening theme with the vocal style of the title song for the film ''[[Aoi sanmyaku]]'' (1949).<ref name=\"SSMinterview3\"/> Versions of it were included in ''Sakura Wars 2'', ''Sakura Wars 4'', and the 2019 soft reboot of ''Sakura Wars''.<ref name=\"ProjectSakura\"/><ref name=\"Sakura4Dorimanga\"/><ref name=\"SakuraCompleteSong\"/>\n\n===Localization===\nWhile Hiroi wanted the series to be released internationally, nearly all games in the ''Sakura Wars'' series remain exclusive to Asian territories.<ref name=\"RPGinterview\"/> Early efforts at localizing the series were not undertaken because of Sega's uncertainty over whether the game's blend of genres would find a large enough audience outside Japan to be profitable.<ref name=\"SakuraLocalReason\"/> An unspecified attempt by Sega to localize the game stalled during the concept approval stage for unknown reasons.<ref name=\"SakuraVvoices\"/> Attempts by an unknown company to localise the PSP port of ''Sakura Wars'' and its sequel were halted as Sony did not give its approval to the project. This was because Sony classified ''Sakura Wars'' as a text novel, making future licensing for importation and translation difficult.<ref name=\"NISinterview\"/>\n\nA [[Korean language|Korean]] translation of ''So Long, My Love'' was published in [[South Korea]] by Sega in 2006.<ref name=\"SakuraVKorea\"/> The PC CD-ROM versions of ''Sakura Wars'' and its sequel were localized and released in [[Russia]] by [[Akella]] in 2006 and 2008 respectively.<ref name=\"SakuraRussia1\"/><ref name=\"SakuraRussia2\"/> Dysin Interactive published the PC versions of ''Sakura Wars'' to ''Sakura Wars 3'' in China,<ref name=\"SakuraPCChin\"/><ref name=\"Sakura3Chin\"/> and ''Sakura Wars 4'' was released in the region by Beijing Entertainment All Technology.<ref name=\"Sakura4ChinA\"/><ref name=\"Sakura4ChinB\"/>\n\nThe first official English release in the ''Sakura Wars'' series is ''So Long, My Love'', which was translated by NIS America in collaboration with Red Entertainment and [[Idea Factory]].<ref name=\"RPGinterview\"/> The dub was produced at [[Bang Zoom! Entertainment]], and included actors from NIS America's localization of the ''[[Disgaea]]'' series.<ref name=\"SakuraVlocalInterview2\"/><ref name=\"SakuraWii\"/> The team also included the Japanese voice track in the PlayStation 2 version, with a dedicated translation which preserved the original character names being created for it.<ref name=\"SakuraVvoices\"/><ref name=\"SakuraVvoices2\"/> The localization took two years to complete, becoming NIS America's largest localization effort to date.<ref name=\"NISinterview\"/><ref name=\"SakuraWii\"/> For the 2019 reboot, Sega brought on ''[[Yakuza 0]]'' translators Inbound Games to localise the game.<ref name=\"Sakura2020Local\"/> The international version uses the Japanese dub with subtitles in other languages.<ref name=\"ProjectSakura\"/>\n\n==Reception and sales==\nBetween the series' debut in 1996 and 2010, the series has sold over 4.5 million copies worldwide.<ref name=\"SakuraRedOverview\"/> Each entry on Sega hardware rank among the best-selling titles for their respective hardware.<ref name=\"SakuraSaturnSales\"/><ref name=\"SakuraDreamSales\"/> The original ''Sakura Wars'' was an immediate success, with several stores being sold out of copies within hours of its release.<ref name=\"SakuraDocumentary\"/> ''Sakura Wars 2'' remains the best-selling title in the series, with over 500,000 copies sold on the Saturn alone, making it one of the console's best-selling titles in Japan.<ref name=\"SakuraSaturnSales\"/><ref name=\"FamSales\"/> ''So Long, My Love'' is the worst-selling mainline entry to date,<ref name=\"FamSales\"/> and was a commercial failure in the West.<ref name=\"NISinterview\"/>\n\nJapanese website [[4Gamer.net]] described the series as a \"legendary\" property connected to Sega, citing several elements such as the anime-style presentation and blend of genres that were hardly seen in gaming at the time.<ref name=\"4Gsakura\"/> Jenni Lada of TechnologyTell wrote a retrospective on the series in 2009, calling ''Sakura Wars'' \"an odd series [...] that defies genres\".<ref name=\"SakuraOverview\"/> In a 1999 [[IGN]] article on the franchise following the announcement of ''Sakura Wars 3'', journalist Anoop Gantayat described it as \"probably the greatest series of games to never make their way stateside\", citing its unprecedented success when compared to other games on Sega hardware at the time.<ref name=\"SakuraIGNretro\"/>\n\nThe series has been popular with both journalists and fans in Japan since the first game's release.<ref name=\"SakuraDocumentary\"/> At the inaugural [[Japan Game Awards|CESA Awards]], ''Sakura Wars'' won the Grand Award, as well as awards in the Best Director, Best Main Character and Best Supporting Character categories.<ref name=\"CESAawards\"/> ''Sakura Wars 2'' won the [[Animation Kobe#Packaged Work Award|Packaged Work Award]] at the 1998 [[Animation Kobe]] event.<ref name=\"Sakura2Award\"/> The soundtrack album of ''Sakura Wars 4''  won in the \"Animation \u2013 Album of the Year\" category at the 2003 [[Japan Gold Disc Award]]s.<ref name=\"Sakura4Award\"/> Prior to release, ''Sakura Wars'' was the second most-wanted game in a ''Famitsu'' poll in 1996, coming in behind ''[[Final Fantasy VII]]''.<ref name=\"SakuraIGNretro\"/> The first four games all appeared on a public ''Famitsu'' poll from 2006 of the 100 best games of all time.<ref name=\"SakuraRating2006\"/> A second later poll ranked the ''Sakura Wars'' games as among the best on the Saturn and Dreamcast.<ref name=\"KotakuSakura\"/> ''Sakura Wars'' heroine Sakura Shinguji was rated in 2009 by ''Famitsu'' as the 17th best Japanese video game character.<ref name=\"FamPoll1UP\"/>\n\n==Related media==\n[[File:sakura-taisen-cafe.jpg|thumb|upright|right|The ''Sakura Wars'' series met with considerable success, spawning a multimedia franchise and having its own themed cafe between 1998 and 2008.<ref name=\"SakuraStore\"/>|alt=A view through a doorway into a cafe area; a sign reads Sakura Cafe and the interior is decorated using wood panelling with red and gold elements.]]\nRed Company and Sega have expanded the ''Sakura Wars'' series into various media.<ref name=\"SakuraDocumentary\"/> These include anime, manga, stage shows, several [[light novel]]s, concerts and CD album releases of soundtracks.

Each character had songs themed after their characters.<ref name=\"4Gsakura\"/><ref name=\"SakuraMedia\"/><ref name=\"SakuraStageCast\"/> The cast, which grew to include those of later games, remained for the entire run with the exception of actress [[Michie Tomizawa]] who retired from the series and her role as character Sumire Kanzaki in 2002.<ref name=\"SakuraStageSumire\"/><ref name=\"SakuraTomizawa\"/> Tomizawa appeared as a guest in later revival concerts.<ref name=\"SakuraStageRevive1\"/><ref name=\"SakuraStageSumire\"/> The original stage shows ran regularly from 1997 to 2006.<ref name=\"SakuraMedia\"/><ref name=\"SakuraStageCast\"/> Since then, it has seen irregular revivals with both the first cast and later additions.<ref name=\"SakuraMedia\"/><ref name=\"SakuraStageRevive1\"/><ref name=\"SakuraRevive2\"/><ref name=\"SakuraStageRevive3\"/> The stage shows were originally meant to end in 2008 along with the franchise, but fan support allowed future revivals.<ref name=\"TanakaBlog\"/> A new stage play based on the 2019 game will premier in March 2020.<ref name=\"ShinSakuraStage\"/>\n\nHiroi wrote a manga adaptation of the first ''Sakura Wars'', which began serialization in 2002.

The term ''vitamin C'' encompasses several [[vitamer]]s that have vitamin C activity in animals. Ascorbate salts such as sodium ascorbate and calcium ascorbate are used in some dietary supplements. These release ascorbate upon digestion. Ascorbate and ascorbic acid are both naturally present in the body, since the forms interconvert according to [[pH]]. Oxidized forms of the molecule such as [[dehydroascorbic acid]] are converted back to ascorbic acid by reducing agents.<ref name=\"DRItext\" />\n\nVitamin C functions as a [[cofactor (biochemistry)|cofactor]] in many [[enzyme|enzymatic]] reactions in animals (and humans) that mediate a variety of essential biological functions, including [[wound healing]] and [[collagen]] synthesis. In humans, vitamin C deficiency leads to impaired [[collagen]] synthesis, contributing to the more severe symptoms of [[scurvy]].<ref name=\"DRItext\" /> Another biochemical role of vitamin C is to act as an [[antioxidant]] (a [[reducing agent]]) by donating electrons to various enzymatic and non-enzymatic reactions.<ref name=\"DRItext\" /> Doing so converts vitamin C to an oxidized state - either as semidehydroascorbic acid or [[dehydroascorbic acid]]. These compounds can be restored to a reduced state by [[glutathione]] and [[NADPH]]-dependent [[enzyme|enzymatic]] mechanisms.<ref name=\"pmid8144521\">{{cite journal |author=Meister A |title=Glutathione-ascorbic acid antioxidant system in animals |journal=J.

For example, vitamin C content of a food sample such as fruit juice can be calculated by measuring the volume of the sample required to decolorize a solution of [[dichlorophenolindophenol]] (DCPIP) and then calibrating the results by comparison with a known concentration of vitamin C.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.foodafactoflife.org.uk/attachments/ff2caf4a-75e5-4aa129132873.pdf |title=Testing Foods for Vitamin C (Ascorbic Acid) |publisher=British Nutrition Foundation |date=2004 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151123101705/http://www.foodafactoflife.org.uk/attachments/ff2caf4a-75e5-4aa129132873.pdf |archivedate=November 23, 2015 |df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nuffieldfoundation.org/practical-biology/measuring-vitamin-c-content-foods-and-fruit-juices |title=Measuring the Vitamin C content of foods and fruit juices |publisher=Nuffield Foundation |date=November 24, 2011 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150721181046/http://www.nuffieldfoundation.org/practical-biology/measuring-vitamin-c-content-foods-and-fruit-juices |archivedate=July 21, 2015 |df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n== Testing ==\nSimple tests are available to measure the levels of vitamin C in [[urine]] and [[serous fluid|serum]].<ref name=Carr2016 /><ref name=Schleicher2009 /> These better reflect recent dietary intake rather than total body content.<ref name=\"DRItext\" /> It has been observed that while serum concentrations follow a [[circadian rhythm]] or reflect short-term dietary impact, content within cells or tissues is more stable and can give a better view of the availability of ascorbate within the entire organism.

UDP-glucuronic acid is formed when UDP-glucose undergoes two oxidations catalyzed by the enzyme UDP-glucose 6-dehydrogenase. UDP-glucose 6-dehydrogenase uses the co-factor NAD<sup>+</sup> as the electron acceptor. The transferase UDP-glucuronate pyrophosphorylase removes a [[Uridine monophosphate|UMP]] and [[glucuronokinase]], with the cofactor ADP, removes the final phosphate leading to [[glucuronic acid|{{sm|d}}-glucuronic acid]]. The aldehyde group of this compound is reduced to a primary alcohol using the enzyme [[glucuronate reductase]] and the cofactor NADPH, yielding [[gulonic acid|{{sm|l}}-gulonic acid]]. This is followed by lactone formation{{Em dash}}utilizing the hydrolase [[gluconolactonase]]{{Em dash}}between the carbonyl on C1 and hydroxyl group on C4. {{sm|l}}-Gulonolactone then reacts with oxygen, catalyzed by the enzyme {{sm|l}}-gulonolactone oxidase (which is nonfunctional in humans and other [[Haplorrhini]] primates; see [[Pseudogene#Unitary pseudogenes|Unitary pseudogenes]]) and the cofactor FAD+.

Briefly, his position was that for optimal health, humans should be consuming at least 2,300&nbsp;mg/day to compensate for the inability to synthesize vitamin C. The recommendation also fell into the consumption range for gorillas - a non-synthesizing near-relative to humans.<ref name=pmid5275366>{{cite journal | vauthors = Pauling L | title = Evolution and the need for ascorbic acid | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 67 | issue = 4 | pages = 1643\u20138 | date = December 1970 | pmid = 5275366 | pmc = 283405 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.67.4.1643 | bibcode = 1970PNAS...67.1643P }}</ref> A second argument for high intake is that serum ascorbic acid concentrations increase as intake increases until it plateaus at about 190 to 200 micromoles per liter (\u00b5mol/L) once consumption exceeds 1,250 milligrams.<ref name=Mandl2009>{{cite journal | vauthors = Mandl J, Szarka A, B\u00e1nhegyi G | title = Vitamin C: update on physiology and pharmacology | journal = British Journal of Pharmacology | volume = 157 | issue = 7 | pages = 1097\u2013110 | date = August 2009 | pmid = 19508394 | pmc = 2743829 | doi = 10.1111/j.1476-5381.2009.00282.x }}</ref> As noted, government recommendations are a range of 40 to 110&nbsp;mg/day and normal plasma is approximately 50 \u00b5mol/L, so 'normal' is about 25% of what can be achieved when oral consumption is in the proposed megadose range.\n\nPauling popularized the concept of high dose vitamin C as prevention and treatment of the common cold in 1970.

The term ''vitamin C'' encompasses several [[vitamer]]s that have vitamin C activity in animals. Ascorbate salts such as sodium ascorbate and calcium ascorbate are used in some dietary supplements. These release ascorbate upon digestion. Ascorbate and ascorbic acid are both naturally present in the body, since the forms interconvert according to [[pH]].

For example, vitamin C content of a food sample such as fruit juice can be calculated by measuring the volume of the sample required to decolorize a solution of [[dichlorophenolindophenol]] (DCPIP) and then calibrating the results by comparison with a known concentration of vitamin C.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.foodafactoflife.org.uk/attachments/ff2caf4a-75e5-4aa129132873.pdf |title=Testing Foods for Vitamin C (Ascorbic Acid) |publisher=British Nutrition Foundation |date=2004 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151123101705/http://www.foodafactoflife.org.uk/attachments/ff2caf4a-75e5-4aa129132873.pdf |archivedate=November 23, 2015 |df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nuffieldfoundation.org/practical-biology/measuring-vitamin-c-content-foods-and-fruit-juices |title=Measuring the Vitamin C content of foods and fruit juices |publisher=Nuffield Foundation |date=November 24, 2011 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150721181046/http://www.nuffieldfoundation.org/practical-biology/measuring-vitamin-c-content-foods-and-fruit-juices |archivedate=July 21, 2015 |df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n== Testing ==\nSimple tests are available to measure the levels of vitamin C in [[urine]] and [[serous fluid|serum]].<ref name=Carr2016 /><ref name=Schleicher2009 /> These better reflect recent dietary intake rather than total body content.<ref name=\"DRItext\" /> It has been observed that while serum concentrations follow a [[circadian rhythm]] or reflect short-term dietary impact, content within cells or tissues is more stable and can give a better view of the availability of ascorbate within the entire organism.

UDP-glucuronic acid is formed when UDP-glucose undergoes two oxidations catalyzed by the enzyme UDP-glucose 6-dehydrogenase. UDP-glucose 6-dehydrogenase uses the co-factor NAD<sup>+</sup> as the electron acceptor. The transferase UDP-glucuronate pyrophosphorylase removes a [[Uridine monophosphate|UMP]] and [[glucuronokinase]], with the cofactor ADP, removes the final phosphate leading to [[glucuronic acid|{{sm|d}}-glucuronic acid]]. The aldehyde group of this compound is reduced to a primary alcohol using the enzyme [[glucuronate reductase]] and the cofactor NADPH, yielding [[gulonic acid|{{sm|l}}-gulonic acid]]. This is followed by lactone formation{{Em dash}}utilizing the hydrolase [[gluconolactonase]]{{Em dash}}between the carbonyl on C1 and hydroxyl group on C4. {{sm|l}}-Gulonolactone then reacts with oxygen, catalyzed by the enzyme {{sm|l}}-gulonolactone oxidase (which is nonfunctional in humans and other [[Haplorrhini]] primates; see [[Pseudogene#Unitary pseudogenes|Unitary pseudogenes]]) and the cofactor FAD+.

The theory behind this, although not the actual term, was described in 1970 in an article by Linus Pauling. Briefly, his position was that for optimal health, humans should be consuming at least 2,300&nbsp;mg/day to compensate for the inability to synthesize vitamin C. The recommendation also fell into the consumption range for gorillas - a non-synthesizing near-relative to humans.<ref name=pmid5275366>{{cite journal | vauthors = Pauling L | title = Evolution and the need for ascorbic acid | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 67 | issue = 4 | pages = 1643\u20138 | date = December 1970 | pmid = 5275366 | pmc = 283405 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.67.4.1643 | bibcode = 1970PNAS...67.1643P }}</ref> A second argument for high intake is that serum ascorbic acid concentrations increase as intake increases until it plateaus at about 190 to 200 micromoles per liter (\u00b5mol/L) once consumption exceeds 1,250 milligrams.<ref name=Mandl2009>{{cite journal | vauthors = Mandl J, Szarka A, B\u00e1nhegyi G | title = Vitamin C: update on physiology and pharmacology | journal = British Journal of Pharmacology | volume = 157 | issue = 7 | pages = 1097\u2013110 | date = August 2009 | pmid = 19508394 | pmc = 2743829 | doi = 10.1111/j.1476-5381.2009.00282.x }}</ref> As noted, government recommendations are a range of 40 to 110&nbsp;mg/day and normal plasma is approximately 50 \u00b5mol/L, so 'normal' is about 25% of what can be achieved when oral consumption is in the proposed megadose range.\n\nPauling popularized the concept of high dose vitamin C as prevention and treatment of the common cold in 1970.

That's why the A and B Buttons are placed for easiest access on the new controller and why they are larger than the other buttons.  They're the buttons that get high traffic.\"<ref name=\"Nintendo Power #79\"/>{{rp|12}}\n\nThe controller was designed to be held in three different positions. First, it can be held by the two outer grips, allowing use of the D-pad, right-hand face buttons and the \"L\" and \"R\" shoulder buttons (but not the Z trigger or analog stick). This style was intended to optimize play in 2D games by emulating the setup on the [[Super NES]] controller.<ref name=\"EGM78\"/><ref>{{cite magazine|last= |first= |title=Get a Grip!!!: Joysticks Past, Present & Future |magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=17|publisher=[[Imagine Media]]|date=May 1996|page=40}}</ref> It can be also held by the center and right-hand grip, allowing the use of the single control stick, the right hand-buttons, the \"R\" shoulder button, and the Z trigger on the rear (but not the \"L\" shoulder button or D-pad). This style was intended for 3D games.<ref name=\"EGM78\"/> Finally, the controller can be held by the center and left-hand grip, allowing for a combination of the D-pad, L shoulder, analog stick, and Z trigger, <ref name=\"EGM78\"/> as was implemented in ''[[GoldenEye 007 (1997 video game)|GoldenEye 007]]''. Additionally, though the controller was not designed with this setup in mind, one controller can be held in each hand with a thumb on each analog stick and index fingers on the Z trigger. This setup allows dual-analog control on some [[first-person shooter]]s such as ''[[Perfect Dark]]''. In some games such as ''[[Mortal Kombat Trilogy]]'', the control stick and directional pad are interchangeable. Very few games use the directional pad exclusively; two examples are the 3D puzzle game ''[[Tetrisphere]]'' and the side-scrolling platformer ''[[Kirby 64: The Crystal Shards]]''.\n\nThis design is controversial, as by its nature it prevents the use of all of its features with the player's hands in any one position; the D-pad, L-shoulder, analog stick and Z-trigger cannot all be used at the same time as it requires the player to switch hand positions, taking the hands off of the key directional controls. When Sony released its [[Dual Analog]] and [[DualShock]] controllers for the competing [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]], it retained the original controllers' two-handled ergonomics, placing the analog sticks below and inside the primary D-pad and face buttons, allowing the player to quickly switch from the D-pad and face buttons to the analog sticks without letting go of the controller. This layout would become dominant in [[gamepad]] design, and several third-party manufacturers would produce aftermarket N64 controllers with more conventional layouts, such as the [[MakoPad]] and [[Hori Mini]]. Nintendo itself would largely follow suit with the stock controller for its [[GameCube]] console, but swapped the positions of the analog stick and D-pad, as by that time the left analog stick had become universally accepted as the primary movement control on 3D games across all consoles.\n\nThe controller also includes four \"C buttons\" on the top, which were originally intended to control the camera in the N64's three-dimensional environments.<ref>{{cite magazine|last= |first= |title=The Ultra 64: Power Packed |magazine=[[GamePro]] |issue=89 |publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]]|date=February 1996|pages=20-21}}</ref> However, since the pad only contains three other face buttons, the C-buttons often became assigned to ulterior functions. An example of this is ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time]]'', where three of the C-buttons can be assigned to secondary items and the upper C-button is used to call [[Navi (The Legend of Zelda)|Navi]] for assistance, while the Z-trigger is used to lock focus onto enemies and center the camera behind the player.\n\n[[File:Nintendo-N64-Controller-Motherboard-Flat-Top.jpg|link=File:Nintendo-N64-Controller-Motherboard-Flat-Top.jpg|thumb|right|The motherboard for the N64 controller.]]\nOne game, ''[[Robotron 64]]'', allows one player to use two controllers to control an [[Avatar (computing)|avatar]]. This way, the game plays like its predecessor, ''[[Robotron 2084]]''. ''Star Wars Episode 1: Racer'', ''GoldenEye 007'' and ''Perfect Dark'' also use this set up for slightly different gameplay experiences (in terms of control, at least) compared to the standard single controller option.\n\nThe controller initially came in six colors (grey, black, red, green, yellow and blue)<ref>{{cite magazine |last= |first= |title=Back in the Swing |magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]] |issue=84|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]] |date=July 1996 |pages=14-16}}</ref> but other colors were released later, many of them coinciding with the release of a similarly colored or designed system. Some of these others include smoke black, watermelon red, jungle green, fire orange, ice blue, grape purple, and special edition colors like gold, atomic purple, extreme green, \"Donkey Kong 64\" banana bunch yellow, \"Pok\u00e9mon\" blue and yellow, and \"Millennium 2000\" platinum. Players would often take apart Nintendo 64 controllers to mix-and-match the tops and bottoms of the shell, creating bi-color controllers.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Shoshinkai: Nintendo Unveils New Disk Drive and 50 Additional Japanese N64 Games|magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|issue=90|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|date=January 1997|pages=116-7}}</ref>\n\nWhen the Nintendo 64 is switched on, the joystick on each controller is automatically calibrated by recording the current position as the center position. That works assuming the hands are off the joystick when the Nintendo 64 is powered on. The joystick can also be recalibrated while the Nintendo 64 is on, by pressing L+R+START to indicate that the current position of the joystick is the center position.\n\n==Analog stick==\n{{original research | section | date=September 2014}}\n[[File:N64-Controller-in-Hand.jpg|thumb|right|One of several ways listed by Nintendo for the player to hold the controller]]\nThe Nintendo 64 controller was one of the first gaming controllers to utilize [[analog stick]] technology as a main feature, intended to provide the user with a wider range of functions such as mobility and camera control. The stick is designed to detect 360 independent directions, compared to the 8 independent directions detected by a [[d-pad]], allowing the potential for Nintendo 64 games to more accurately emulate 360\u00b0 of motion.<ref name=\"NGen14\"/>\n\nAnalog joysticks prior to the Nintendo 64 include those used by the [[Atari 5200]], [[Sega]]'s [[List of Sega arcade system boards|arcade systems]], the [[Neo Geo CD]] analog stick in 1994, Sega's analog Mission Stick for the [[Sega Saturn|Saturn]] (which launched on September 29, 1995),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sega.jp/archive/segahard/ss/mission.html |script-title=ja:[\u30bb\u30ac\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u5927\u767e\u79d1] \u30a2\u30ca\u30ed\u30b0\u30df\u30c3\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u30b9\u30c6\u30a3\u30c3\u30af |language=Japanese |trans-title=The Sega encyclopedia - analog mission stick |publisher=[[Sega]] |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071017180618/http://sega.jp/archive/segahard/ss/mission.html |archivedate=2007-10-17 }}</ref> and [[Sony]]'s [[PlayStation Analog Joystick|Analog Joystick]]. The Nintendo 64 controller distinguished itself from these precursors by using an analog thumbstick, which was predated only by the [[Mega Drive]]'s XE-1 AP, designed by third-party manufacturer Dempa in 1989<ref>{{cite web|url=https://segaretro.org/XE-1_AP |title=XE-1 AP entry in Sega Retro Archive.}}</ref>. The Nintendo 64 controller was released contemporaneously with Sega's 3D Pad for their Saturn system, and was followed during the [[Fifth generation of video game consoles|fifth console generation]] by Sony's [[Dual Analog Controller|Dual Analog]] and [[DualShock]] controllers for the [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] system.\n\nThe N64 analog stick uses a pair of optical encoding disks to determine its position. This is very similar to how ball mice work.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.picaxeforum.co.uk/archive/index.php/t-24584.html|title=N64 wireless computer controller mod|accessdate=24 January 2014}}</ref> Since optical encoding disks only give the system relative changes in the position of the analog stick, the system assumes that the stick is centered during power-on and tracks relative movements from there. If things get out of sync, or if the control stick was not centered during power-on, the center position can be reset by pressing the left and right shoulder buttons (L and R) at the same time as the Start button.

That's why the A and B Buttons are placed for easiest access on the new controller and why they are larger than the other buttons.  They're the buttons that get high traffic.\"<ref name=\"Nintendo Power #79\"/>{{rp|12}}\n\nThe controller was designed to be held in three different positions. First, it can be held by the two outer grips, allowing use of the D-pad, right-hand face buttons and the \"L\" and \"R\" shoulder buttons (but not the \"Z\" trigger or analog stick). This style was intended to optimize play in 2D games by emulating the setup on the [[Super NES]] controller.<ref name=\"EGM78\"/><ref>{{cite magazine|last= |first= |title=Get a Grip!!!: Joysticks Past, Present & Future |magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=17|publisher=[[Imagine Media]]|date=May 1996|page=40}}</ref> It can be also held by the center and right-hand grip, allowing the use of the single control stick, the right hand-buttons, the \"R\" shoulder button, and the \"Z\" trigger on the rear (but not the \"L\" shoulder button or D-pad). This style was intended for 3D games.<ref name=\"EGM78\"/> Finally, the controller can be held by the center and left-hand grip, allowing for a combination of the D-pad, L-shoulder, analog stick and Z button, <ref name=\"EGM78\"/> as was implemented in ''[[GoldenEye 007 (1997 video game)|GoldenEye 007]]''. Additionally, though the controller was not designed with this setup in mind, one controller can be held in each hand with a thumb on each analog stick and index fingers on the \"Z\" trigger. This setup allows dual-analog control on some [[first-person shooter]]s such as ''[[Perfect Dark]]''. In some games such as ''[[Mortal Kombat Trilogy]]'', the control stick and directional pad are interchangeable. Very few games use the directional pad exclusively; two examples are the 3D puzzle game ''[[Tetrisphere]]'' and the side-scrolling platformer ''[[Kirby 64: The Crystal Shards]]''.\n\nThis design is controversial, as by its nature it prevents the use of all of its features with the player's hands in any one position; the D-pad, L-shoulder, analog stick and Z-trigger cannot all be used at the same time as it requires the player to switch hand positions, taking the hands off of the key directional controls. When Sony released its [[Dual Analog]] and [[DualShock]] controllers for the competing [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]], it retained the original controllers' two-handled ergonomics, placing the analog sticks below and inside the primary D-pad and face buttons, allowing the player to quickly switch from the D-pad and face buttons to the analog sticks without letting go of the controller. This layout would become dominant in [[gamepad]] design, and several third-party manufacturers would produce aftermarket N64 controllers with more conventional layouts, such as the [[MakoPad]] and [[Hori Mini]]. Nintendo itself would largely follow suit with the stock controller for its [[GameCube]] console, but swapped the positions of the analog stick and D-pad, as by that time the left analog stick had become universally accepted as the primary movement control on 3D games across all consoles.\n\nThe controller also includes four \"C buttons\" on the top, which were originally intended to control the camera in the N64's three-dimensional environments.<ref>{{cite magazine|last= |first= |title=The Ultra 64: Power Packed |magazine=[[GamePro]] |issue=89 |publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]]|date=February 1996|pages=20-21}}</ref> However, since the pad only contains three other face buttons, the C-buttons often became assigned to ulterior functions. An example of this is ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time]]'', where three of the C-buttons can be assigned to secondary items and the upper C-button is used to call [[Navi (The Legend of Zelda)|Navi]] for assistance, while the Z-trigger is used to lock focus onto enemies and center the camera behind the player.\n\n[[File:Nintendo-N64-Controller-Motherboard-Flat-Top.jpg|link=File:Nintendo-N64-Controller-Motherboard-Flat-Top.jpg|thumb|right|The motherboard for the N64 controller.]]\nOne game, ''[[Robotron 64]]'', allows one player to use two controllers to control an [[Avatar (computing)|avatar]]. This way, the game plays like its predecessor, ''[[Robotron 2084]]''. ''Star Wars Episode 1: Racer'', ''GoldenEye 007'' and ''Perfect Dark'' also use this set up for slightly different gameplay experiences (in terms of control, at least) compared to the standard single controller option.\n\nThe controller initially came in six colors (grey, black, red, green, yellow and blue)<ref>{{cite magazine |last= |first= |title=Back in the Swing |magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]] |issue=84|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]] |date=July 1996 |pages=14-16}}</ref> but other colors were released later, many of them coinciding with the release of a similarly colored or designed system. Some of these others include smoke black, watermelon red, jungle green, fire orange, ice blue, grape purple, and special edition colors like gold, atomic purple, extreme green, \"Donkey Kong 64\" banana bunch yellow, \"Pok\u00e9mon\" blue and yellow, and \"Millennium 2000\" platinum. Players would often take apart Nintendo 64 controllers to mix-and-match the tops and bottoms of the shell, creating bi-color controllers.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Shoshinkai: Nintendo Unveils New Disk Drive and 50 Additional Japanese N64 Games|magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|issue=90|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|date=January 1997|pages=116-7}}</ref>\n\nWhen the Nintendo 64 is switched on, the joystick on each controller is automatically calibrated by recording the current position as the center position. That works assuming the hands are off the joystick when the Nintendo 64 is powered on. The joystick can also be recalibrated while the Nintendo 64 is on, by pressing L+R+START to indicate that the current position of the joystick is the center position.\n\n==Analog stick==\n{{original research | section | date=September 2014}}\n[[File:N64-Controller-in-Hand.jpg|thumb|right|One of several ways listed by Nintendo for the player to hold the controller]]\nThe Nintendo 64 controller was one of the first gaming controllers to utilize [[analog stick]] technology as a main feature, intended to provide the user with a wider range of functions such as mobility and camera control. The stick is designed to detect 360 independent directions, compared to the 8 independent directions detected by a [[d-pad]], allowing the potential for Nintendo 64 games to more accurately emulate 360\u00b0 of motion.<ref name=\"NGen14\"/>\n\nAnalog joysticks prior to the Nintendo 64 include those used by the [[Atari 5200]], [[Sega]]'s [[List of Sega arcade system boards|arcade systems]], the [[Neo Geo CD]] analog stick in 1994, Sega's analog Mission Stick for the [[Sega Saturn|Saturn]] (which launched on September 29, 1995),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sega.jp/archive/segahard/ss/mission.html |script-title=ja:[\u30bb\u30ac\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u5927\u767e\u79d1] \u30a2\u30ca\u30ed\u30b0\u30df\u30c3\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u30b9\u30c6\u30a3\u30c3\u30af |language=Japanese |trans-title=The Sega encyclopedia - analog mission stick |publisher=[[Sega]] |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071017180618/http://sega.jp/archive/segahard/ss/mission.html |archivedate=2007-10-17 }}</ref> and [[Sony]]'s [[PlayStation Analog Joystick|Analog Joystick]]. The Nintendo 64 controller distinguished itself from these precursors by using an analog thumbstick, which was predated only by the [[Mega Drive]]'s XE-1 AP, designed by third-party manufacturer Dempa in 1989<ref>{{cite web|url=https://segaretro.org/XE-1_AP |title=XE-1 AP entry in Sega Retro Archive.}}</ref>. The Nintendo 64 controller was released contemporaneously with Sega's 3D Pad for their Saturn system, and was followed during the [[Fifth generation of video game consoles|fifth console generation]] by Sony's [[Dual Analog Controller|Dual Analog]] and [[DualShock]] controllers for the [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] system.\n\nThe N64 analog stick uses a pair of optical encoding disks to determine its position. This is very similar to how ball mice work.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.picaxeforum.co.uk/archive/index.php/t-24584.html|title=N64 wireless computer controller mod|accessdate=24 January 2014}}</ref> Since optical encoding disks only give the system relative changes in the position of the analog stick, the system assumes that the stick is centered during power-on and tracks relative movements from there. If things get out of sync, or if the control stick was not centered during power-on, the center position can be reset by pressing the left and right shoulder buttons (L and R) at the same time as the Start button. The system then assumes the joystick is centered and continues to track relative movements from there. While the optical encoding disks are mostly digital and provide very accurate relative movements, third party controllers and joysticks often use cheaper potentiometers instead. These allow the controller to track the absolute position of the joystick, but since the signal is analog, it's very noisy and can fluctuate even if the joystick isn't moved.{{citation needed |date=September 2014}}\n\n==Rumble Pak==\n{{Main|Rumble Pak#Nintendo 64}}\nThe original Rumble Pak, designed for the Nintendo 64 controller, was released in April 1997 to coincide with the release of ''[[Star Fox 64]]'' and requires two [[AAA battery|AAA batteries]].
