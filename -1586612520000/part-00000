It took place between 10 August and 5 September 1643, between the defending Parliamentarian garrison of [[Gloucester]] and the besieging army of [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]]. The siege ended with the arrival of a relieving Parliamentarian army under the [[Robert Devereux, 3rd Earl of Essex|Earl of Essex]]. The Royalist forces withdrew, having sustained heavy casualties and had several cannons disabled as a result of sallies made by the defenders.\n\n==Prelude==\nFollowing the Royalist defeat at the [[Battle of Edgehill]] in October 1642, King Charles I's control of the south was limited to [[Cornwall]], [[Wales]] and the [[Welsh Marches|Marches]], and a pocket of the [[Thames Valley]] around [[Oxford]], where he based his wartime capital.<ref>Day 2007 p. 29</ref> The ruling [[Puritans|Puritan]] elite of [[Gloucester]] ensured the city of some 5,000 inhabitants would be from the outset a staunchly Parliamentarian stronghold in the struggle against an anti-Puritan King and his [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] Queen.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 59\u201360</ref> Possession of Gloucester, along with [[Bristol]] to the south, threatened both Oxford and access to the Royalist recruiting grounds of Wales.<ref>Day 2007 p. 21</ref>\n\nAn unsuccessful attempt to rally Royalist support in [[Cirencester]] in August 1642 prompted Parliamentarians in [[Gloucestershire]] to muster the [[Militia (English)|militia]], and in November the first regular troops were garrisoned in Gloucester.<ref>Day 2007 p. 60</ref> In February 1643 the Royalist commander [[Prince Rupert of the Rhine|Prince Rupert]] easily defeated a militia garrison at Cirencester, prompting the Parliamentarians to recall their outposts at [[Berkeley, Gloucestershire|Berkeley]], [[Sudeley Castle|Sudeley]] and [[Tewkesbury]]. The next day Rupert appeared before Gloucester, but lacked the strength to enforce his demand for the city's surrender. Later that month an army of 2,000 Welshman led by [[Henry Somerset, 1st Duke of Beaufort|Lord Herbert of Raglan]] arrived on the west bank of the Severn opposite the city, but lacked the strength for an assault across the river. Its presence caused great consternation in Gloucester until a Parliamentarian army commanded by Sir [[William Waller]] defeated it on 24 March.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 60\u201362</ref>\n\nThe defeat of Waller in the [[Battle of Roundway Down]] on 13 July by the Royalist Western Army left both Bristol and Gloucester vulnerable, and on 18 July Rupert led another Royalist army out of Oxford to take control of the Severn valley. On 26 July Rupert's Oxford Army, supported by the Western Army, seized Bristol. Royalist casualties were high, and despite Rupert's instructions to the contrary, the victorious troops plundered the city.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 21\u201325</ref> Rupert was appointed governor of Bristol, but infighting within the Royalist leadership and concerns that an attack on Gloucester would result in the same high casualties prompted [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]] to travel to Bristol for a council of war.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 26\u201328</ref> He arrived on 2 August, and over the next five days consulted with his advisers on the best course of action. The strategic situation since Edgehill had improved significantly for the Royalists, with victories in the north of England, the arrival of reinforcements and materiel in June, and an opposition that had fallen into disarray.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 29\u201331</ref> Rupert's plan to consolidate the Royalist grip on the west by seizing Gloucester faced opposition from those in the King's camp, led by his wife Queen [[Henrietta Maria of France|Henrietta Maria]], who believed a march on London could end the war.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 51\u201353</ref>\n\nThe capture of Gloucester would give Charles some advantages. It would allow the Royalist garrisons farther up the Severn at [[Worcester]] and [[Shrewsbury]] to be supplied from Bristol, with consequent benefit to the economy of that city. Gloucestershire \u2013 populous, wealthy and Parliamentarian \u2013 could be punitively taxed, and Welsh manpower and money could be freely deployed against the King's enemies in the rest of the country. Although it was likely that Rupert would have been able to storm a city that was less well defended than Bristol, Charles was not willing to risk the casualties an assault would incur.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 54\u201355</ref> On 6 August the Parliamentarian governor of Gloucester, Lieutenant-Colonel [[Edward Massey]], refused to surrender the city, but in a secret communication he let it be known that he would do so if the King, rather than Rupert, led the army on Gloucester. Charles decided the next day that this was the best chance of securing Gloucester quickly and without bloodshed. This compromise plan pleased neither the Queen's faction, who saw it as an unnecessary diversion from the more decisive objective of London, nor Rupert, who remained in Bristol in the belief that the Royalist army was not strong enough to allow Massey to honourably surrender without a fight.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 55\u201357</ref>\n\n==Gloucester defences==\nGloucester's strength lay in its location. To the west, the River Severn formed a natural defence against an assaulting army. To the north and north-east the marshy ground was unsuitable for siege operations, and the River Twyver and a tributary stream added to the obstacles. This left the higher and drier ground to the east and south as the only feasible directions for an attack. In the preceding centuries the city had grown beyond its medieval defences, of which only the ruined [[Gloucester Castle|castle]] by the river and a stretch of wall that linked the south, east and original north fates, the last known as the inner north gate and now well within the city, still survived. From the south gate to the east gate the wall was high but not thick enough to withstand 17th-century artillery or mining operations.<ref name=Day65\u201366>Day 2007 pp. 65\u201366</ref>\n\nThe fall of Bristol prompted the hurried reinforcement of the existing defences. New earthworks and a narrow water-filled ditch completed the line of fortifications from the south gate to the Severn. Another earthwork was extended north from Whitefriars Barn on the north-east corner of the medieval wall to the outer north gate. From there the River Twyver formed a moat as the earthwork followed it north-west to Alvin Gate then on to the river's junction with the Old Severn.<ref name=Day65\u201366 /> This easternmost channel of the River Severn had dried up by the 19th century, but at the time of the civil war it was still a navigable river.<ref>Herbert 1988 para. 2</ref><ref>Rhodes 2006 p. 14</ref> The earthwork then followed the Old Severn south-west to a point a short distance north of Westgate Street, from where it was extended the other side of the Old Severn to the River Severn just above the west gate.<ref name=Day66>Day 2007 p. 66</ref> Inside the city, an earthwork was extended west from the end of the medieval wall at the inner north gate via [[Gloucester Cathedral]] to [[St Oswald's Priory, Gloucester|St Oswald's Priory]], where it met the new outer earthwork.<ref name=Day66 /> The outer north gate and Alvin Gate were fortified with earthwork [[bastion]]s,<ref name=Day66 /> a drawbridge was installed at Westgate Bridge and the Old Severn was dammed at Dockham, causing the ground to north-west of the city to flood.<ref>Rhodes 2006 pp. 17, 29\u201330</ref>\n\nThe garrison numbered no more than 1,500 troops. The bulk of these comprised two half-strength regiments each of some 600 men: the [[Henry Grey, 1st Earl of Stamford|Earl of Stamford]]'s Regiment of Foot, recruited from London and Leicestershire, and a locally recruited regiment known as the Town Regiment. The remainder comprised a company of [[Trained bands|trained band]], 100 [[dragoon]]s and a [[troop]] of cavalry. The city's dozen or so artillery pieces ranged in size from light cannon to two nine-pounder [[demi-culverin]]s. Stamford's regiment was experienced and well led, though of uncertain discipline. The Town Regiment lacked experience but was motivated by its ties to the city it was defending, although there is evidence that some of its men would refuse to oppose the King. The city could support itself with basic necessities, but it lacked sufficient gunpowder to withstand an assault or prolonged siege.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 63\u201365</ref>\n\nMassey was an autocratic military commander, but his authority in the city was shared with the civilian administration. A committee had been established in December 1642 to manage the Parliamentarian war effort in the county, but [[Thomas Pury]], the [[member of parliament]] for Gloucester, was the only committee member in the city. Civic authority was held by a forty-member council, though in practice an inner core of some fifteen [[Alderman|aldermen]], including the mayor, wielded power. As many of these were, like Pury, officers in the city's garrison, political and military command was largely integrated.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 66\u201367</ref> In the days immediately following the fall of Bristol, morale in the city, both military and civilian, was low.<ref>Day 2007 p. 68</ref> It's possible that this was what prompted Massey consider surrendering the city, though his message suggesting he would may have been a subterfuge designed to buy some time.<ref>Day 2007 p. 73</ref> There is strong evidence that the conduct and actions of the city elite, including Massey and particularly Pury, did much to stiffen the city's resolve. Officers and councillors with Royalist sympathies were given the opportunity to leave, and those who remained were required to restate an oath of allegiance to Parliament. The discipline of the troops was improved by paying them, and civilians were kept busy reinforcing the city's defences.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 69\u201370</ref>\n\n==Siege==\nAs Charles marched north from Bristol, reinforcements were converging on Gloucester from Oxford, Worcester and Herefordshire.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 86\u201387</ref> By the afternoon of 10 August the Royalist army, comprising some 6,000 infantry and 2,500 mounted troops, began assembling around the city.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 90\u201391</ref> Charles set up his headquarters at [[Matson, Gloucester|Matson]] House.<ref>Day 2007 p. 97</ref> His demand for Gloucester's surrender was unanimously and somewhat insolently rejected, and the Parliamentarians set fire to the suburbs outside the city defences to clear lines of fire and deprive the Royalists of cover.<ref>Day 2007 pp. , 91\u201393,96</ref> Charles had decided to march on Gloucester in the belief that the city would be quickly surrendered. Now that gambit had failed, he decided to besiege it. His pride had been wounded by the manner of the Parliamentarian rejection. His commanders, assessing the state of the city's defences, supplies and morale, persuaded him the city could be taken within ten days without an assault. Intelligence indicated the even if the Parliamentarians were able to send a relieving force, it could be easily defeated before it could reach the city. Most decisively, the [[William Cavendish, 1st Duke of Newcastle|Earl of Newcastle]], whose support was necessary in any campaign against London, declared himself unable to march south while Hull remained in Parliamentarian hands, leaving Charles too weak to contemplate such a move.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 93\u201395</ref>\n\nThe first shots were fired in the afternoon as Sir [[Jacob Astley, 1st Baron Astley of Reading|Jacob Astley]] established his forces near Issold's House on the eastern side of the city. [[Patrick Ruthven, 1st Earl of Forth|Lord Forth]], who had been given overall command of the siege, set up a fortified leaguer to the rear of the ruined [[Llanthony Secunda Priory]] and established his forces to the south of the city.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 95\u201396, 99, 100\u2013101</ref> By dawn on 11 August, a line of trenches had been dug some {{convert|130|yd|m}} from the walls, placing the two sides within musket range of each other, stretching from [[Brunswick Square, Gloucester|Gaudy Green]] on the south side to Issold's House on the east.<ref>Day 2007 p. 99</ref> Massey responded with spoiling tactics in an attempt to hinder Royalist siege operations and delay the assault he was expecting. At midnight a small raiding party succeeded in disrupting Royalist entrenching operations on Gaudy Green, and a larger raid on the green the next morning, 12 August, resulted in the capture of Royalist men, tools and weapons.<ref>Day 2007 p. 100</ref> By this time, the reinforcements from Herefordshire and Worcester under the command of Sir William Vavasour arrived on the west bank of the Severn and began crossing the river to take up positions at Kingsholm, to the north of the city. This force increased the size of the besieging army by another 2,400 infantry and over 300 cavalry. They too were the target of a Parliamentarian raid which inflicted up to fifteen casualties on the Royalists.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 10, 100</ref>\n\nLater on 12 August, Forth completed an earthwork square on Gaudy Green, in which he placed two 24-pounders, the largest of the Royalist's eight cannon, along with a 12-pounder to target the south wall. Another artillery emplacement was positioned to target the east wall nearby.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 10, 99\u2013102</ref> With the artillery in place, the Royalists began bombarding the walls, with the main effort beginning at 11:00 on 13 August. The cannon were too light to have any significant impact, and of the two mortars the Royalists possessed, one, reputed to be the largest in the country, exploded on its first use. When it became evident the Royalists were focusing their efforts on the south-east corner of the city defences, Massey quickly buttressed the medieval walls with up to {{convert|5|ft|m}} of earth, which ensured that the defences held. Meanwhile, the majority of Vavasour's troops completed their crossing of the Severn, leaving behind a small contingent to blockade the west bank.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 100\u2013102</ref>\n\nReacting to rumours that Vavasour had received a reinforcement of artillery, the Parliamentarians mounted another raid to the north of the city on 14 August. They captured two prisoners but failed in their primary objective of locating and spiking any guns.<ref>Day 2007 p. 102</ref> The Royalist bombardment continued through 14 August, but a breach blown in the wall by the larger guns on Gaudy Green was quickly plugged by the defenders with woolsacks and [[gabion]]s. Royalist engineers mining towards the walls from trenches at the green succeeded in draining the ditch below the walls, but this was not followed up with an assault. By the end of the day the Royalist guns had fallen silent; the evidence suggests they had run out of ammunition.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 102\u2013103</ref>\n\nThe following day Vavasour received a reinforcement of 500 [[Glamorgan]] militia and 450 musketeers from Bristol, while the Parliamentarians bolstered the earthwork defences around the south and north gates. On 16 August Rupert accompanied Charles to Oxford, and neither were at Gloucester to witness the most ambitious Parliamentarian raid yet. Just before sunset, 150 musketeers of Stamford's regiment sallied out of the north gate to attack the Royalist trenches east of the city. The Parliamentarians claimed 100 Royalist killed for the cost of 2 injured, while Royalist sources report 24 Parliamentarians killed and more wounded, for the loss of 4 Royalists killed.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 103\u2013105</ref>\n\nStruggling with a shortage of gunpowder and with the guns quiet, the Royalists concentrated on mining operations to breach the city walls. Miners recruited from the [[Forest of Dean]] were set to work under a protective gallery to fill the {{convert|12|ft|m|adj=on}} deep by {{convert|30|ft|m|adj=on}} wide moat which, when completed, would allow them to undermine the walls. It was slow work, estimated to need a week to complete. The faster alternative was to forgo the protection and fill the moat with [[fascine]]s. An attempt to do this was beaten back by musket fire from the walls, and resulted in the desertion of the miners.<ref>Day 2007 103, 106\u2013107</ref>\n\nBy 18 August Vavasour had deployed three cannon in front of his main camp at Kingsholm and another opposite Alvin Gate. These were the targets of a Parliamentarian raid that morning that was even larger than previous efforts; a diversionary attack by 50 men and a main force of 400. All four of Vavasour's cannon were disabled, the Parliamentarians claiming over 100 Royalist casualties for the loss of 6, the Royalists admitting 28 casualties and claiming to have killed 27 Parliamentarians. Another Parliamentarian raid the same day involved their only recorded use of cavalry during the siege, when 150 musketeers and 40 cavalry mounted an ineffectual attack on Royalist positions to the east of the city. Charles, meanwhile, was on his way back to Gloucester with another 1,000 reinforcements.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 106\u2013107</ref>\n\nBy the morning of 19 August, two 6-pounder cannon had been installed in a third emplacement opposite the east gate, bringing all the original artillery online. At 10:00, the bombardment was resumed in a last effort to subdue the city by the original ten-day deadline. Constrained by the limited supplies of ammunition and gunpowder, the bombardment had little material effect, though it prompted Massey to hastily erect a breastwork in the open ground of Friar's Orchard, at the south east corner of the city where the Royalist artillery was being concentrated. A Royalist attempt to cross the moat after dark was beaten back by musket fire. The objective of forcing the surrender of Gloucester by siege in ten days had failed, partly due to the city's resolve and Massey's spoiling attacks, but mainly due to the inadequacy of the Royalist artillery.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 107\u2013109</ref> \n\nThe Parliamentarians mounted another raid at dawn on 21 August. It was a two-pronged attack designed to disable the Royalist artillery south and east of the walls. One detachment travelled by boat down the Severn, landed between Forth's camp and a redoubt opposite the castle and successfuly stormed the redoubt. The second detachment of 200 musketeers sallied from the north gate. Intending first to attack the battery opposite the east gate, this force became lost and blundered into Royalist infantry camps. When Massey saw that the raid was not going to plan, he sounded the recall. The Parliamentarians suffered eight casualties, the Royalists more than twenty. Such raids were proving risky and wasteful of the garrison's limited ammunition, and this was the last large-scale operation mounted by the Parliamentarians.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 112\u2013113</ref>\n\nAs the Royalists set about replenishing their stocks of ammunition, they intensified their mining efforts. It was anticipated that the original effort to bridge the moat would allow the besiegers to reach the east wall on 24 August. A second effort to bridge the moat to the south was begun, as was a more complicated project to tunnel towards the east gate. Royalist agents attempted to persuade the garrison to surrender, and Royalist cavalry staged a mock battle in an unsuccessful attempt to lure the garrison out of the city in the belief that a relief force had arrived.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 114\u2013115</ref> A desultory bombardment was maintained, particularly by the mortars, until 25 August, when it was intensified. An attempt that day by Massey to disrupt it with a sally from the north gate was beaten back by cavalry, but as before, a shortage of ammunition \u2013 at one stage the Royalists resorted to firing stones \u2013 blunted the impact, and little damage was done to the city.<ref>Day 2007 p. 116</ref>\n\nFollowing news that the [[Robert Devereux, 3rd Earl of Essex|Earl of Essex]] was raising a Parliamentarian army in London, Charles and Rupert travelled to Oxford on 26 August, where they held a two-day council of war. With no intelligence of Essex's plans, the Royalists bolstered the defences of Oxford with troops earmarked for the siege of Gloucester while the Royalist garrison at Bristol was urged to send all the forces it could spare to Gloucester. Believing that Essex could muster no more than 6,000 troops, the decision was made to continue the siege, though contingency plans for the blockade of Gloucester were drawn up in case it had to be lifted. [[Henry Wilmot, 1st Earl of Rochester|Lord Wilmot]] was instructed to muster 2,000 cavalry around [[Banbury]]. Their task would be to delay the Parliamentarians in the [[Cotswolds]] until Rupert could come up with the rest of the Royalist cavalry in support, should Essex march to the relief of Gloucester.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 117\u2013118</ref>\n\nEssex began his march from [[Colnbrook]], west of London, on 26 August.<ref>Day 2007 p. 127</ref> His plan was to relieve Gloucester without provoking a major battle in which, with the Royalist superiority in cavalry, he would be at a disdvantage. His route was dictated by the desire to minimise the amount of open country favourable to cavalry operations he would have to pass through, and took him north of Oxford via Aylesbury and Bicester and then across the Cotswolds.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 124\u2013126</ref> At the beginning of September Essex was due north of Oxford with an army of some 10,500 infantry, no more than 4,500 mounted troops and an artillery train that is estimated at no more than 50 guns.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 130\u2013131, 133</ref>\n\nMining was now the principal tactic by which the Royalists hoped to bring the siege to a successful conclusion. Priority was given to tunnelling at the east gate, which caused progress on efforts to fill the moat below the south and east walls to slow, possibly as a result of a lack of miners and engineers. Parliamentarian countermining at the east gate on 28 August was quickly abandoned because of springs that caused flooding, which accounts for the slow pace of the Royalist efforts there.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 136\u2013138</ref> Massey continued to harass the besiegers with sniping and artillery fire, and he resumed countermining operations at the east gate after a reconnaissance party had reported the Royalists miners were still working on their mine. The progress of the Royalist mines closer towards the walls, quickened by the arrival of Welsh miners on 29 August, led Massey to believe an an assault was imminent. On 1 September he fortified Friars Orchard with an earthwork wall and [[Sconce (fortification)|sconce]], a fort in which he placed four pieces of artillery that could be brought to bear on any Royalists who broke through the south-east corner or the east gate.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 138\u2013140</ref> \n\nBy the end of the siege, Massey had only three barrels of gunpowder left for the defence of the city.\n\n==Aftermath==\nWith the arrival of the Earl of Essex, the Royalists forces withdrew and began to march on towards London. They intercepted Essex's army at the [[First Battle of Newbury]], but failed to destroy it. For the remainder of the war, Massey's force based in Gloucester continually threatened the lines of communication between Oxford, the King's wartime capital, and Wales and the West Country.\n\nFollowing the return of Charles II to the throne, the king took his revenge upon the city by having its walls torn down. The foundations of the wall, however, are still visible in parts of the city today.\n\n==Notes==\n{{Notelist|30em}}\n\n==Commemoration==\nFor centuries afterwards, the lifting of the siege was marked by an annual [[Gloucester Day]].

It took place between 10 August and 5 September 1643, between the defending Parliamentarian garrison of [[Gloucester]] and the besieging army of [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]]. The siege ended with the arrival of a relieving Parliamentarian army under the [[Robert Devereux, 3rd Earl of Essex|Earl of Essex]]. The Royalist forces withdrew, having sustained heavy casualties and had several cannons disabled as a result of sallies made by the defenders.\n\n==Prelude==\nFollowing the Royalist defeat at the [[Battle of Edgehill]] in October 1642, King Charles I's control of the south was limited to [[Cornwall]], [[Wales]] and the [[Welsh Marches|Marches]], and a pocket of the [[Thames Valley]] around [[Oxford]], where he based his wartime capital.<ref>Day 2007 p. 29</ref> The ruling [[Puritans|Puritan]] elite of [[Gloucester]] ensured the city of some 5,000 inhabitants would be from the outset a staunchly Parliamentarian stronghold in the struggle against an anti-Puritan King and his [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] Queen.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 59\u201360</ref> Possession of Gloucester, along with [[Bristol]] to the south, threatened both Oxford and access to the Royalist recruiting grounds of Wales.<ref>Day 2007 p. 21</ref>\n\nAn unsuccessful attempt to rally Royalist support in [[Cirencester]] in August 1642 prompted Parliamentarians in [[Gloucestershire]] to muster the [[Militia (English)|militia]], and in November the first regular troops were garrisoned in Gloucester.<ref>Day 2007 p. 60</ref> In February 1643 the Royalist commander [[Prince Rupert of the Rhine|Prince Rupert]] easily defeated a militia garrison at Cirencester, prompting the Parliamentarians to recall their outposts at [[Berkeley, Gloucestershire|Berkeley]], [[Sudeley Castle|Sudeley]] and [[Tewkesbury]]. The next day Rupert appeared before Gloucester, but lacked the strength to enforce his demand for the city's surrender. Later that month an army of 2,000 Welshman led by [[Henry Somerset, 1st Duke of Beaufort|Lord Herbert of Raglan]] arrived on the west bank of the Severn opposite the city, but lacked the strength for an assault across the river. Its presence caused great consternation in Gloucester until a Parliamentarian army commanded by Sir [[William Waller]] defeated it on 24 March.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 60\u201362</ref>\n\nThe defeat of Waller in the [[Battle of Roundway Down]] on 13 July by the Royalist Western Army left both Bristol and Gloucester vulnerable, and on 18 July Rupert led another Royalist army out of Oxford to take control of the Severn valley. On 26 July Rupert's Oxford Army, supported by the Western Army, seized Bristol. Royalist casualties were high, and despite Rupert's instructions to the contrary, the victorious troops plundered the city.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 21\u201325</ref> Rupert was appointed governor of Bristol, but infighting within the Royalist leadership and concerns that an attack on Gloucester would result in the same high casualties prompted [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]] to travel to Bristol for a council of war.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 26\u201328</ref> He arrived on 2 August, and over the next five days consulted with his advisers on the best course of action. The strategic situation since Edgehill had improved significantly for the Royalists, with victories in the north of England, the arrival of reinforcements and materiel in June, and an opposition that had fallen into disarray.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 29\u201331</ref> Rupert's plan to consolidate the Royalist grip on the west by seizing Gloucester faced opposition from those in the King's camp, led by his wife Queen [[Henrietta Maria of France|Henrietta Maria]], who believed a march on London could end the war.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 51\u201353</ref>\n\nThe capture of Gloucester would give Charles some advantages. It would allow the Royalist garrisons farther up the Severn at [[Worcester]] and [[Shrewsbury]] to be supplied from Bristol, with consequent benefit to the economy of that city. Gloucestershire \u2013 populous, wealthy and Parliamentarian \u2013 could be punitively taxed, and Welsh manpower and money could be freely deployed against the King's enemies in the rest of the country. Although it was likely that Rupert would have been able to storm a city that was less well defended than Bristol, Charles was not willing to risk the casualties an assault would incur.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 54\u201355</ref> On 6 August the Parliamentarian governor of Gloucester, Lieutenant-Colonel [[Edward Massey]], refused to surrender the city, but in a secret communication he let it be known that he would do so if the King, rather than Rupert, led the army on Gloucester. Charles decided the next day that this was the best chance of securing Gloucester quickly and without bloodshed. This compromise plan pleased neither the Queen's faction, who saw it as an unnecessary diversion from the more decisive objective of London, nor Rupert, who remained in Bristol in the belief that the Royalist army was not strong enough to allow Massey to honourably surrender without a fight.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 55\u201357</ref>\n\n==Gloucester defences==\nGloucester's strength lay in its location. To the west, the River Severn formed a natural defence against an assaulting army. To the north and north-east the marshy ground was unsuitable for siege operations, and the River Twyver and a tributary stream added to the obstacles. This left the higher and drier ground to the east and south as the only feasible directions for an attack. In the preceding centuries the city had grown beyond its medieval defences, of which only the ruined [[Gloucester Castle|castle]] by the river and a stretch of wall that linked the south, east and original north fates, the last known as the inner north gate and now well within the city, still survived. From the south gate to the east gate the wall was high but not thick enough to withstand 17th-century artillery or mining operations.<ref name=Day65\u201366>Day 2007 pp. 65\u201366</ref>\n\nThe fall of Bristol prompted the hurried reinforcement of the existing defences. New earthworks and a narrow water-filled ditch completed the line of fortifications from the south gate to the Severn. Another earthwork was extended north from Whitefriars Barn on the north-east corner of the medieval wall to the outer north gate. From there the River Twyver formed a moat as the earthwork followed it north-west to Alvin Gate then on to the river's junction with the Old Severn.<ref name=Day65\u201366 /> This easternmost channel of the River Severn had dried up by the 19th century, but at the time of the civil war it was still a navigable river.<ref>Herbert 1988 para. 2</ref><ref>Rhodes 2006 p. 14</ref> The earthwork then followed the Old Severn south-west to a point a short distance north of Westgate Street, from where it was extended the other side of the Old Severn to the River Severn just above the west gate.<ref name=Day66>Day 2007 p. 66</ref> Inside the city, an earthwork was extended west from the end of the medieval wall at the inner north gate via [[Gloucester Cathedral]] to [[St Oswald's Priory, Gloucester|St Oswald's Priory]], where it met the new outer earthwork.<ref name=Day66 /> The outer north gate and Alvin Gate were fortified with earthwork [[bastion]]s,<ref name=Day66 /> a drawbridge was installed at Westgate Bridge and the Old Severn was dammed at Dockham, causing the ground to north-west of the city to flood.<ref>Rhodes 2006 pp. 17, 29\u201330</ref>\n\nThe garrison numbered no more than 1,500 troops. The bulk of these comprised two half-strength regiments each of some 600 men: the [[Henry Grey, 1st Earl of Stamford|Earl of Stamford]]'s Regiment of Foot, recruited from London and Leicestershire, and a locally recruited regiment known as the Town Regiment. The remainder comprised a company of [[Trained bands|trained band]], 100 [[dragoon]]s and a [[troop]] of cavalry. The city's dozen or so artillery pieces ranged in size from light cannon to two nine-pounder [[demi-culverin]]s. Stamford's regiment was experienced and well led, though of uncertain discipline. The Town Regiment lacked experience but was motivated by its ties to the city it was defending, although there is evidence that some of its men would refuse to oppose the King. The city could support itself with basic necessities, but it lacked sufficient gunpowder to withstand an assault or prolonged siege.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 63\u201365</ref>\n\nMassey was an autocratic military commander, but his authority in the city was shared with the civilian administration. A committee had been established in December 1642 to manage the Parliamentarian war effort in the county, but [[Thomas Pury]], the [[member of parliament]] for Gloucester, was the only committee member in the city. Civic authority was held by a forty-member council, though in practice an inner core of some fifteen [[Alderman|aldermen]], including the mayor, wielded power. As many of these were, like Pury, officers in the city's garrison, political and military command was largely integrated.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 66\u201367</ref> In the days immediately following the fall of Bristol, morale in the city, both military and civilian, was low.<ref>Day 2007 p. 68</ref> It's possible that this was what prompted Massey consider surrendering the city, though his message suggesting he would may have been a subterfuge designed to buy some time.<ref>Day 2007 p. 73</ref> There is strong evidence that the conduct and actions of the city elite, including Massey and particularly Pury, did much to stiffen the city's resolve. Officers and councillors with Royalist sympathies were given the opportunity to leave, and those who remained were required to restate an oath of allegiance to Parliament. The discipline of the troops was improved by paying them, and civilians were kept busy reinforcing the city's defences.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 69\u201370</ref>\n\n==Siege==\nAs Charles marched north from Bristol, reinforcements were converging on Gloucester from Oxford, Worcester and Herefordshire.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 86\u201387</ref> By the afternoon of 10 August the Royalist army, comprising some 6,000 infantry and 2,500 mounted troops, began assembling around the city.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 90\u201391</ref> Charles set up his headquarters at [[Matson, Gloucester|Matson]] House.<ref>Day 2007 p. 97</ref> His demand for Gloucester's surrender was unanimously and somewhat insolently rejected, and the Parliamentarians set fire to the suburbs outside the city defences to clear lines of fire and deprive the Royalists of cover.<ref>Day 2007 pp. , 91\u201393,96</ref> Charles had decided to march on Gloucester in the belief that the city would be quickly surrendered. Now that gambit had failed, he decided to besiege it. His pride had been wounded by the manner of the Parliamentarian rejection. His commanders, assessing the state of the city's defences, supplies and morale, persuaded him the city could be taken within ten days without an assault. Intelligence indicated the even if the Parliamentarians were able to send a relieving force, it could be easily defeated before it could reach the city. Most decisively, the [[William Cavendish, 1st Duke of Newcastle|Earl of Newcastle]], whose support was necessary in any campaign against London, declared himself unable to march south while Hull remained in Parliamentarian hands, leaving Charles too weak to contemplate such a move.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 93\u201395</ref>\n\nThe first shots were fired in the afternoon as Sir [[Jacob Astley, 1st Baron Astley of Reading|Jacob Astley]] established his forces near Issold's House on the eastern side of the city. [[Patrick Ruthven, 1st Earl of Forth|Lord Forth]], who had been given overall command of the siege, set up a fortified leaguer to the rear of the ruined [[Llanthony Secunda Priory]] and established his forces to the south of the city.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 95\u201396, 99, 100\u2013101</ref> By dawn on 11 August, a line of trenches had been dug some {{convert|130|yd|m}} from the walls, placing the two sides within musket range of each other, stretching from [[Brunswick Square, Gloucester|Gaudy Green]] on the south side to Issold's House on the east.<ref>Day 2007 p. 99</ref> Massey responded with spoiling tactics in an attempt to hinder Royalist siege operations and delay the assault he was expecting. At midnight a small raiding party succeeded in disrupting Royalist entrenching operations on Gaudy Green, and a larger raid on the green the next morning, 12 August, resulted in the capture of Royalist men, tools and weapons.<ref>Day 2007 p. 100</ref> By this time, the reinforcements from Herefordshire and Worcester under the command of Sir William Vavasour arrived on the west bank of the Severn and began crossing the river to take up positions at Kingsholm, to the north of the city. This force increased the size of the besieging army by another 2,400 infantry and over 300 cavalry. They too were the target of a Parliamentarian raid which inflicted up to fifteen casualties on the Royalists.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 10, 100</ref>\n\nLater on 12 August, Forth completed an earthwork square on Gaudy Green, in which he placed two 24-pounders, the largest of the Royalist's eight cannon, along with a 12-pounder to target the south wall. Another artillery emplacement was positioned to target the east wall nearby.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 10, 99\u2013102</ref> With the artillery in place, the Royalists began bombarding the walls, with the main effort beginning at 11:00 on 13 August. The cannon were too light to have any significant impact, and of the two mortars the Royalists possessed, one, reputed to be the largest in the country, exploded on its first use. When it became evident the Royalists were focusing their efforts on the south-east corner of the city defences, Massey quickly buttressed the medieval walls with up to {{convert|5|ft|m}} of earth, which ensured that the defences held. Meanwhile, the majority of Vavasour's troops completed their crossing of the Severn, leaving behind a small contingent to blockade the west bank.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 100\u2013102</ref>\n\nReacting to rumours that Vavasour had received a reinforcement of artillery, the Parliamentarians mounted another raid to the north of the city on 14 August. They captured two prisoners but failed in their primary objective of locating and spiking any guns.<ref>Day 2007 p. 102</ref> The Royalist bombardment continued through 14 August, but a breach blown in the wall by the larger guns on Gaudy Green was quickly plugged by the defenders with woolsacks and [[gabion]]s. Royalist engineers mining towards the walls from trenches at the green succeeded in draining the ditch below the walls, but this was not followed up with an assault. By the end of the day the Royalist guns had fallen silent; the evidence suggests they had run out of ammunition.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 102\u2013103</ref>\n\nThe following day Vavasour received a reinforcement of 500 [[Glamorgan]] militia and 450 musketeers from Bristol, while the Parliamentarians bolstered the earthwork defences around the south and north gates. On 16 August Rupert accompanied Charles to Oxford, and neither were at Gloucester to witness the most ambitious Parliamentarian raid yet. Just before sunset, 150 musketeers of Stamford's regiment sallied out of the north gate to attack the Royalist trenches east of the city. The Parliamentarians claimed 100 Royalist killed for the cost of 2 injured, while Royalist sources report 24 Parliamentarians killed and more wounded, for the loss of 4 Royalists killed.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 103\u2013105</ref>\n\nStruggling with a shortage of gunpowder and with the guns quiet, the Royalists concentrated on mining operations to breach the city walls. Miners recruited from the [[Forest of Dean]] were set to work under a protective gallery to fill the {{convert|12|ft|m|adj=on}} deep by {{convert|30|ft|m|adj=on}} wide moat which, when completed, would allow them to undermine the walls. It was slow work, estimated to need a week to complete. The faster alternative was to forgo the protection and fill the moat with [[fascine]]s. An attempt to do this was beaten back by musket fire from the walls, and resulted in the desertion of the miners.<ref>Day 2007 103, 106\u2013107</ref>\n\nBy 18 August Vavasour had deployed three cannon in front of his main camp at Kingsholm and another opposite Alvin Gate. These were the targets of a Parliamentarian raid that morning that was even larger than previous efforts; a diversionary attack by 50 men and a main force of 400. All four of Vavasour's cannon were disabled, the Parliamentarians claiming over 100 Royalist casualties for the loss of 6, the Royalists admitting 28 casualties and claiming to have killed 27 Parliamentarians. Another Parliamentarian raid the same day involved their only recorded use of cavalry during the siege, when 150 musketeers and 40 cavalry mounted an ineffectual attack on Royalist positions to the east of the city. Charles, meanwhile, was on his way back to Gloucester with another 1,000 reinforcements.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 106\u2013107</ref>\n\nBy the morning of 19 August, two 6-pounder cannon had been installed in a third emplacement opposite the east gate, bringing all the original artillery online. At 10:00, the bombardment was resumed in a last effort to subdue the city by the original ten-day deadline. Constrained by the limited supplies of ammunition and gunpowder, the bombardment had little material effect, though it prompted Massey to hastily erect a breastwork in the open ground of Friar's Orchard, at the south east corner of the city where the Royalist artillery was being concentrated. A Royalist attempt to cross the moat after dark was beaten back by musket fire. The objective of forcing the surrender of Gloucester by siege in ten days had failed, partly due to the city's resolve and Massey's spoiling attacks, but mainly due to the inadequacy of the Royalist artillery.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 107\u2013109</ref> \n\nThe Parliamentarians mounted another raid at dawn on 21 August. It was a two-pronged attack designed to disable the Royalist artillery south and east of the walls. One detachment travelled by boat down the Severn, landed between Forth's camp and a redoubt opposite the castle and successfuly stormed the redoubt. The second detachment of 200 musketeers sallied from the north gate. Intending first to attack the battery opposite the east gate, this force became lost and blundered into Royalist infantry camps. When Massey saw that the raid was not going to plan, he sounded the recall. The Parliamentarians suffered eight casualties, the Royalists more than twenty. Such raids were proving risky and wasteful of the garrison's limited ammunition, and this was the last large-scale operation mounted by the Parliamentarians.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 112\u2013113</ref>\n\nAs the Royalists set about replenishing their stocks of ammunition, they intensified their mining efforts. It was anticipated that the original effort to bridge the moat would allow the besiegers to reach the east wall on 24 August. A second effort to bridge the moat to the south was begun, as was a more complicated project to tunnel towards the east gate. Royalist agents attempted to persuade the garrison to surrender, and Royalist cavalry staged a mock battle in an unsuccessful attempt to lure the garrison out of the city in the belief that a relief force had arrived.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 114\u2013115</ref> A desultory bombardment was maintained, particularly by the mortars, until 25 August, when it was intensified. An attempt that day by Massey to disrupt it with a sally from the north gate was beaten back by cavalry, but as before, a shortage of ammunition \u2013 at one stage the Royalists resorted to firing stones \u2013 blunted the impact, and little damage was done to the city.<ref>Day 2007 p. 116</ref>\n\nFollowing news that the [[Robert Devereux, 3rd Earl of Essex|Earl of Essex]] was raising a Parliamentarian army in London, Charles and Rupert travelled to Oxford on 26 August, where they held a two-day council of war. With no intelligence of Essex's plans, the Royalists bolstered the defences of Oxford with troops earmarked for the siege of Gloucester while the Royalist garrison at Bristol was urged to send all the forces it could spare to Gloucester. Believing that Essex could muster no more than 6,000 troops, the decision was made to continue the siege, though contingency plans for the blockade of Gloucester were drawn up in case it had to be lifted. [[Henry Wilmot, 1st Earl of Rochester|Lord Wilmot]] was instructed to muster 2,000 cavalry around [[Banbury]]. Their task would be to delay the Parliamentarians in the [[Cotswolds]] until Rupert could come up with the rest of the Royalist cavalry in support, should Essex march to the relief of Gloucester.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 117\u2013118</ref>\n\nEssex began his march from [[Colnbrook]], west of London, on 26 August.<ref>Day 2007 p. 127</ref> His plan was to relieve Gloucester without provoking a major battle in which, with the Royalist superiority in cavalry, he would be at a disdvantage. His route was dictated by the desire to minimise the amount of open country favourable to cavalry operations he would have to pass through, and took him north of Oxford via Aylesbury and Bicester and then across the Cotswolds.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 124\u2013126</ref> At the beginning of September Essex was due north of Oxford with an army of some 10,500 infantry, no more than 4,500 mounted troops and an artillery train that is estimated at no more than 50 guns.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 130\u2013131, 133</ref>\n\nMining was now the principal tactic by which the Royalists hoped to bring the siege to a successful conclusion. Priority was given to tunnelling at the east gate, which caused progress on efforts to fill the moat below the south and east walls to slow, possibly as a result of a lack of miners and engineers. Parliamentarian countermining at the east gate on 28 August was quickly abandoned because of springs that caused flooding, which accounts for the slow pace of the Royalist efforts there.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 136\u2013138</ref> Massey continued to harass the besiegers with sniping and artillery fire, and he resumed countermining operations at the east gate after a reconnaissance party had reported the Royalists were still working on their mine. The progress of the Royalist miners closer towards the walls, quickened by the arrival of Welsh miners on 29 August, led Massey to believe an an assault was imminent. On 1 September he fortified Friars Orchard with an earthwork wall and [[Sconce (fortification)|sconce]], a fort in which he placed four pieces of artillery that could be brought to bear on any Royalists who broke through the south-east corner or the east gate.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 138\u2013140</ref> \n\nBy the end of the siege, Massey had only three barrels of gunpowder left for the defence of the city.\n\n==Aftermath==\nWith the arrival of the Earl of Essex, the Royalists forces withdrew and began to march on towards London. They intercepted Essex's army at the [[First Battle of Newbury]], but failed to destroy it. For the remainder of the war, Massey's force based in Gloucester continually threatened the lines of communication between Oxford, the King's wartime capital, and Wales and the West Country.\n\nFollowing the return of Charles II to the throne, the king took his revenge upon the city by having its walls torn down. The foundations of the wall, however, are still visible in parts of the city today.\n\n==Notes==\n{{Notelist|30em}}\n\n==Commemoration==\nFor centuries afterwards, the lifting of the siege was marked by an annual [[Gloucester Day]]. This died out in the nineteenth century but was reinstated in 2009.<ref name=bbc>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/gloucestershire/8239588.stm Tradition revived for city pride.] BBC News, 5 September 2009.

He is among the most influential and acclaimed figures in the [[history of jazz]] and 20th-century music. Davis adopted a variety of musical directions in a five-decade career that kept him at the forefront of many major stylistic developments in jazz.<ref name=\"allmusic\"/>\n\nBorn in Alton, Illinois, and raised in [[East St. Louis]], Davis left to study at the [[Juilliard School]] in [[New York City]], before dropping out and making his professional debut as a member of [[saxophone|saxophonist]] [[Charlie Parker]]'s [[bebop]] quintet from 1944 to 1948. Shortly after, he recorded the ''[[Birth of the Cool]]'' sessions for [[Capitol Records]], which were instrumental to the development of [[cool jazz]].

He wrote that in 1954 Sugar Ray Robinson \"was the most important thing in my life besides music\" and adopted Robinson's \"arrogant attitude.\"{{sfn|Davis|Troupe|1990|p=183}} He showed contempt for critics and the press. There were well-publicized confrontations with the public and with other musicians. An argument with [[Thelonious Monk]] during the recording of ''Bags' Groove'' was reported.<ref>Davis had asked Monk to \"lay off\" (stop playing) while he was soloing. In his autobiography, Davis says that Monk \"could not play behind a horn.\" [[Charles Mingus]] reported this, and more, in his \"Open Letter to Miles Davis.\"</ref> In mid-1954, Davis reunited with Gr\u00e9co for the first time since 1949 after she arrived in New York City for film prospects.

He convinced organizer [[George Wein]] that he should be on the bill, and Wein agreed.{{sfn|The Complete Illustrated History|2007|p=73}} The performance was praised by critics and increased his popularity among affluent white audiences.{{sfn|Morton|2005|p=27}} He tied with Dizzy Gillespie for best trumpeter in the 1955 ''Down Beat'' magazine Readers' Poll.{{sfn|Cook|2007|pp=43\u201344}}\n\n[[George Avakian]] of [[Columbia Records]] saw Davis perform at Newport and wanted to sign him to the label. Davis had one year left on his contract with Prestige, which required him to release four more albums. He signed a contract with Columbia that included a $4,000 advance (US${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|4000|1955}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars{{inflation-fn|US}}) and a condition that his recordings for Columbia would remain unreleased until his agreement with Prestige expired.{{sfn|Carr|1998|96}}{{sfn|Davis|Troupe|1990|p=192}}\n\nAt the request of Avakian, he formed the [[Miles Davis Quintet]] for a performance at [[Caf\u00e9 Bohemia]]. The quintet consisted of Davis on trumpet, Sonny Rollins on tenor saxophone, [[Red Garland]] on piano, [[Paul Chambers]] on double bass, and [[Philly Joe Jones]] on drums. Rollins was replaced by [[John Coltrane]], completing the membership of the first quintet. This group appeared on his final albums for Prestige: ''[[Cookin' with the Miles Davis Quintet]]'' (1957), ''[[Relaxin' with the Miles Davis Quintet]]'' (1958), ''[[Workin' with the Miles Davis Quintet]]'' (1960), and ''[[Steamin' with the Miles Davis Quintet]]'' (1961). The music on all four albums was recorded in two one-day sessions in 1956 with [[Rudy Van Gelder]]. Each album helped establish Davis's quintet as one of the best.{{sfn|Chambers|1998|p=223}}{{sfn|Cook|2007|p=45}}{{sfn|Carr|1998|99}}\n\nThe style of the group was an extension of their experience playing with Davis. He played long, legato, melodic lines, while Coltrane contrasted with energetic solos. Their live repertoire was a mix of bebop, standards from the [[Great American Songbook]] and pre-bop eras, and traditional tunes. They appeared on ''[['Round About Midnight]]'', Davis's first album for Columbia.\n\nIn 1956, he left his quintet temporarily to tour Europe as part of the Birdland All-Stars, which included the [[Modern Jazz Quartet]] and French and German musicians. In Paris, he reunited with Gr\u00e9co and they \"remained lovers for many years\".{{sfn|Davis|Troupe|1990|p=186}}{{sfn|Early|2001|p=215}} He then returned home, reunited his quintet and toured the US for two months. Conflict arose on tour as he grew impatient with the drug habits of Jones and Coltrane. Davis was trying to live a healthier life by exercising and reducing his alcohol. But he continued to use cocaine.{{sfn|Davis|Troupe|1990|p=209}} At the end of the tour, he fired Jones and Coltrane and replaced them with Sonny Rollins and [[Art Taylor]].{{sfn|Davis|Troupe|1990|p=214}}\n\nIn November 1957, Davis went to Paris and recorded the [[Ascenseur pour l'\u00e9chafaud (soundtrack)|soundtrack]] to ''Ascenseur pour l'\u00e9chafaud''<ref name=\"New Grove\" /> directed by [[Louis Malle]] (1958). Consisting of French session musicians [[Barney Wilen]], [[Pierre Michelot]], and [[Ren\u00e9 Urtreger]], and American drummer [[Kenny Clarke]], the group avoided a written score and instead improvised while they watched the film in a recording studio.\n\nAfter returning to New York City, Davis revived his quintet with Adderley<ref name=\"New Grove\" /> and Coltrane, who was clean from his drug habit. Now a sextet, the group recorded material in early 1958 that was released on ''[[Milestones (Miles Davis album)|Milestones]]'' (1958), an album that demonstrated Davis's interest in [[modal jazz]]. A performance by [[Les Ballets Africains]] drew him to slower, deliberate music that allowed the creation of solos from harmony rather than chords.{{sfn|The Complete Illustrated History|2007|p=97}} In this form of ballet music, the [[kalimba]] was played for a long periods on a single chord, weaving in and out of [[consonance and dissonance]].{{sfn|Early|2001|p=89}}\n\nBy May 1958, he had replaced Jones with drummer [[Jimmy Cobb]], and Red Garland left the group, leaving Davis to play piano on \"Sid's Ahead\" for the album ''Milestones''.{{sfn|Davis|Troupe|1990|p=224}} He wanted someone who could play modal jazz, so he hired [[Bill Evans]], a young, white pianist with a background in classical music.{{sfn|Davis|Troupe|1990|p=229}} Evans had an impressionistic approach to piano. His ideas greatly influenced Davis. But after eight months of touring, a tired Evans left. [[Wynton Kelly]], his replacement, brought to the group a swinging style that contrasted with Evans's delicacy. The sextet made their recording debut on ''[[Jazz Track]]'' (1958).{{sfn|Davis|Troupe|1990|p=229}}\n\n===1957\u20131963: Collaborations with Gil Evans and ''Kind of Blue''===\nBy early 1957, Davis was exhausted from recording and touring with his quintet and wished to pursue new projects. During a two-week residency in Chicago in March, the 30-year-old Davis told journalists of his intention to retire at its conclusion and revealed offers he had received to become a teacher at [[Harvard University]] and a musical director at a record label.{{sfn|Szwed|2004|p=139}}{{sfn|Carr|1998|p=107}} Avakian agreed that it was time for Davis to explore something different, but Davis rejected his suggestion of returning to his nonet as he considered that a step backward.{{sfn|Carr|1998|p=107}} Avakian then suggested that he work with a bigger ensemble, similar to ''Music for Brass'' (1957), an album of orchestral and brass-arranged music led by [[Gunther Schuller]] featuring Davis as a guest soloist.\n\nDavis accepted and worked with Gil Evans in what became a five-album collaboration from 1957 to 1962.{{sfn|Szwed|2004|p=140}} ''[[Miles Ahead (album)|Miles Ahead]]'' (1957) showcased Davis playing a flugelhorn and a rendition \"The Maids of Cadiz\" by [[L\u00e9o Delibes]], the first piece of classical music that Davis recorded. Evans devised orchestral passages as transitions, thus turning the album into one long piece of music.{{sfn|Szwed|2004|p=141}}<ref>Cook, op. cit.</ref> ''[[Porgy and Bess (Miles Davis album)|Porgy and Bess]]'' (1959) includes arrangements of pieces from George Gershwin's [[Porgy and Bess|opera]]. ''[[Sketches of Spain]]'' (1960) contained music by composers [[Joaqu\u00edn Rodrigo]] and [[Manuel de Falla]] and originals by Evans. The classical musicians had trouble improvising, while the jazz musicians couldn't handle the difficult arrangements, but the album was a critical success, selling over 120,000 copies in the US.{{sfn|The Complete Illustrated History|2007|p=108}} Davis performed with an orchestra conducted by Evans at Carnegie Hall in May 1961 to raise money for charity.{{sfn|The Complete Illustrated History|2007|p=109}} The pair's final album was ''[[Quiet Nights (Miles Davis and Gil Evans album)|Quiet Nights]]'' (1962), a collection of [[bossa nova]] songs released against their wishes. Evans stated it was only half an album and blamed the record company; Davis blamed producer [[Teo Macero]] and refused to speak to him for more than two years.{{sfn|Carr|1998|pp=192\u2013193}} Davis noted later that \"my best friend is Gil Evans\";{{sfn|Lees|2001|p=24}} their work was included in the boxed set ''[[Miles Davis & Gil Evans: The Complete Columbia Studio Recordings]]'' (1996), which won a [[Grammy Award for Best Historical Album]] and [[Grammy Award for Best Album Notes|Best Album Notes]] in 1997.\n\nIn March and April 1959, Davis recorded what many critics consider his greatest album, ''[[Kind of Blue]]'' (1959). He named the album for its mood.{{sfn|The Complete Illustrated History|2007|p=106}} He called back Bill Evans, as the music had been planned around Evans's piano style.{{sfn|Kahn|2001|p=95}} Both Davis and Evans were familiar with [[George Russell (composer)|George Russell]]'s ideas about modal jazz.{{sfn|Kahn|2001|pp=29\u201330}}{{sfn|Kahn|2001|p=74}} But Davis neglected to tell pianist Wynton Kelly that Evans was returning, so Kelly appeared on only one song, \"[[Freddie Freeloader]].\" {{sfn|Kahn|2001|p=95}} The sextet had played \"[[So What (instrumental)|So What]]\" and \"[[All Blues]]\" at performances, but the remaining three compositions they saw for the first time in the studio.\n\nReleased in August 1959, ''Kind of Blue'' was an instant success, with widespread radio airplay and rave reviews from critics.{{sfn|The Complete Illustrated History|2007|p=106}} It remains the best selling jazz album of all time.

The quintet played essentially the same bebop tunes and standards that Davis's previous bands had played, but they approached them with structural and rhythmic freedom and occasionally breakneck speed.\n\nIn 1964, Coleman was replaced by saxophonist [[Sam Rivers]] until Davis persuaded [[Wayne Shorter]] to leave [[Art Blakey]]. This quintet lasted through 1968. Shorter became the group's principal composer, and the album ''E.S.P.'' (1965) was named after his composition. While touring Europe, the group made its first album, ''[[Miles in Berlin]]'' (1965).{{sfn|Einarson|2005|pp=56\u201357}}\n\nDavis needed medical attention for hip pain, which had worsened since his Japanese tour during the previous year.{{sfn|Carr|1998|p=202}} He underwent hip replacement surgery in April 1965, with bone taken from his shin, but it failed.

The quintet's approach to the new music became known as \"time no changes\"\u2014which referred to Davis's decision to depart from chordal sequences and adopt a more open approach, with the rhythm section responding to the soloists' melodies.{{sfn|Morton|2005|p=49}} Through ''Nefertiti'' the studio recordings consisted primarily of originals composed by Shorter, with occasional compositions by the other sidemen. In 1967, the group began to play their concerts in continuous sets, each tune flowing into the next, with only the melody indicating any sort of change. His bands performed this way until his hiatus in 1975.\n\n''Miles in the Sky'' and ''Filles de Kilimanjaro''\u2014which tentatively introduced electric bass, electric piano, and electric guitar on some tracks\u2014pointed the way to the [[jazz fusion|fusion]] phase of Davis's career. He also began experimenting with more rock-oriented rhythms on these records. By the time the second half of ''Filles de Kilimanjaro'' was recorded, bassist [[Dave Holland]] and pianist [[Chick Corea]] had replaced Carter and Hancock.

To help his situation, Davis had Buckmaster come over to collaborate on new music.{{sfn|Carr|1998|p=340}} After arriving, Buckmaster organized an [[intervention (counseling)|intervention]] for Davis, who was living in squalor among cockroach infestations, in the dark with his curtains always closed.

Davis later thanked Buckmaster for helping him.{{sfn|Carr|1998|p=343}}\n\n===1980\u20131985: Comeback===\nDavis hadn't played the trumpet much for three years and found it difficult to reclaim his [[embouchure]].

He brought in producer, composer, and keyboardist [[Robert Irving III]], who had collaborated with him on ''The Man with the Horn''. With a seven-piece band that included Scofield, Evans, Irving, Foster, and [[Darryl Jones]], he played a series of European performances that were positively received. In December 1984, while in Denmark, he was awarded the [[L\u00e9onie Sonning Music Prize]]. Trumpeter [[Palle Mikkelborg]] had written a contemporary classical piece titled \"Aura\" for the event which impressed Davis to the point of returning to Denmark in early 1985 to record his next studio album, ''[[Aura (Miles Davis album)|Aura]]'' (1989).{{sfn|The Complete Illustrated History|2007|p=183}} Columbia was dissatisfied with the recording and delayed its release.\n\nIn May 1985, one month into a tour, Davis signed a contract with [[Warner Bros.

Marsalis whispered into Davis' ear that \"someone\" had told him to do so. Davis responded by ordering him off the stage.{{sfn|Davis|Troupe|1990|p=374}} Davis had become increasingly irritated at Columbia's delay in releasing ''Aura''. The breaking point appears to have come when a producer at Columbia asked him to call Marsalis and wish him a happy birthday.

He is among the most influential and acclaimed figures in the [[history of jazz]] and 20th-century music. Davis adopted a variety of musical directions in a five-decade career that kept him at the forefront of many major stylistic developments in jazz.<ref name=\"allmusic\"/>\n\nBorn in Alton, Illinois, and raised in [[East St. Louis]], Davis left to study at the [[Juilliard School]] in [[New York City]], before dropping out and making his professional debut as a member of [[saxophone|saxophonist]] [[Charlie Parker]]'s [[bebop]] quintet from 1944 to 1948. Shortly after, he recorded the ''[[Birth of the Cool]]'' sessions for [[Capitol Records]], which were instrumental to the development of [[cool jazz]]. In the early 1950s, Miles Davis recorded some of the earliest [[hard bop]] music while on [[Prestige Records]] but did so haphazardly due to a [[heroin]] addiction. After a widely acclaimed comeback performance at the [[Newport Jazz Festival]] in 1955, he signed a long-term contract with [[Columbia Records]] and recorded the 1957 album ''[['Round About Midnight]]''.{{sfn|Yanow|2005|p=176}} It was his first work with saxophonist [[John Coltrane]] and bassist [[Paul Chambers]], key members of the sextet he led into the early 1960s. During this period, he alternated between orchestral jazz collaborations with arranger [[Gil Evans]], such as the Spanish-influenced ''[[Sketches of Spain]]'' (1960), and band recordings, such as ''[[Milestones (Miles Davis album)|Milestones]]'' (1958) and ''[[Kind of Blue]]'' (1959).<ref name=\"aar\"/> The latter recording remains one of the most popular jazz albums of all time,{{sfn|McCurdy|2004|p=61}} having sold over five million copies in the U.S.\n\nDavis made several lineup changes while recording ''[[Someday My Prince Will Come (Miles Davis album)|Someday My Prince Will Come]]'' (1961), his [[In Person Friday and Saturday Nights at the Blackhawk, Complete|1961 Blackhawk concerts]], and ''[[Seven Steps to Heaven]]'' (1963), another mainstream success that introduced bassist [[Ron Carter]], pianist [[Herbie Hancock]], and drummer [[Tony Williams (drummer)|Tony Williams]].<ref name=\"aar\"/> After adding saxophonist [[Wayne Shorter]] to his new quintet in 1964,<ref name=\"aar\">{{cite web|url=http://www.aaregistry.org/historic_events/view/miles-davis-innovative-influential-and-respected-jazz-legend|title=Miles Davis, innovative, influential, and respected jazz legend|publisher=African American Registry|accessdate=June 11, 2016}}</ref> Davis led them on a series of more abstract recordings often composed by the band members, helping pioneer the [[post-bop]] genre with albums such as ''[[E.S.P.

Critics were generally unreceptive but the decade garnered the trumpeter his highest level of commercial recognition.

They owned a {{convert|200|acre|adj=on}} estate near [[Pine Bluff, Arkansas|Pine Bluff]], Arkansas with a profitable pig farm. In Pine Bluff, he and his siblings fished, hunted, and rode horses.{{sfn|The Complete Illustrated History|2007|p=17}}{{sfn|Orr|2012|p=11}} In 1927, the family moved to [[East St. Louis]], Illinois. They lived on the second floor of a commercial building behind a dental office in a predominantly white neighborhood. From 1932 to 1934, Davis attended John Robinson Elementary School, an all-black school,{{sfn|Early|2001|p=209}} then Crispus Attucks, where he performed well in mathematics, music, and sports.{{sfn|Orr|2012|p=11}} At an early age he liked music, especially blues, big bands, and gospel.{{sfn|The Complete Illustrated History|2007|p=17}}\n\n[[File:MilesDavisYouthHouse.EastStLouis.17thStreetandKansasAvenue.3.jpg|thumb|The house at 1701 Kansas Avenue in East St. Louis, Illinois, where Davis lived from 1939 to 1944]]\n\nIn 1935, Davis received his first trumpet as a gift from John Eubanks, a friend of his father.{{sfn|Early|2001|p=210}} He took lessons from [[Elwood Buchanan]], a teacher and musician who was a patient of his father.{{sfn|Cook|2007|p=9}} His mother wanted him to play violin instead.{{sfn|The Complete Illustrated History|2007|p=19}} Against the fashion of the time, Buchanan stressed the importance of playing without [[vibrato]] and encouraged him to use a clear, mid-range tone.

Years later, Davis said that he was discriminated against in these competitions due to his race, but he added that these experiences made him a better musician.{{sfn|Orr|2012|p=11}} When a drummer asked him to play a certain passage of music, and he couldn't do it, he began to learn [[music theory]]. \"I went and got everything, every book I could get to learn about theory.\"{{sfn|The Complete Illustrated History|2007|p=23}} At Lincoln, Davis met his first girlfriend, Irene Birth (later Cawthon).{{sfn|Morton|2005|p=10}} He had a band that performed at the Elks Club.<ref name=\"Arons\">{{cite web|last1=Arons |first1=Rachel|title=Slide Show: American Public Libraries Great and Small|url=http://www.grahamfoundation.org/system/grants/press/284/original/Dawson_MediaCov_NewYorker_20140321.pdf|website=Graham Foundation|accessdate=8 May 2018|page=5|date=21 March 2014|format=PDF}}</ref> Part of his earnings paid for his sister's education at [[Fisk University]].{{sfn|Early|2001|p=211}} Davis befriended trumpeter [[Clark Terry]], who suggested he play without vibrato, and performed with him for several years.{{sfn|Early|2001|p=210}}{{sfn|Early|2001|p=211}}\n\nWith encouragement from his teacher and girlfriend, Davis filled a vacant spot in the Rhumboogie Orchestra, also known as the Blue Devils, led by Eddie Randle.

One track featured singer [[Kenny Hagood]]. The presence of white musicians in the group angered some black players, many of whom were unemployed at the time, yet Davis rebuffed their criticisms.{{sfn|Davis|Troupe|1990|p=117}} Recording sessions with the nonet for Capitol continued until April 1950; much of it remained unreleased until the issue of ''[[Birth of the Cool]]'' (1957).\n\nIn May 1949, Davis performed with the [[Tadd Dameron]] Quintet with [[Kenny Clarke]] and [[James Moody (saxophonist)|James Moody]] at the [[Paris Jazz Festival|Paris International Jazz Festival]].

By 1953, his addiction began to impair his playing. His drug habit became public in a ''Down Beat'' interview with [[Cab Calloway]], whom he never forgave as it brought him \"all pain and suffering.\"{{sfn|Davis|Troupe|1990|p=164}} He returned to St. Louis and stayed with his father for several months.{{sfn|Davis|Troupe|1990|p=164}} Though he continued to use heroin, he met Roach and Mingus in September 1953 on their way to Los Angeles and joined their band, but the trip caused problems.{{sfn|Davis|Troupe|1990|pp=164\u2013165}} He returned to his father's home, \"determined to kick my habit ... that was the only thing on my mind.\"{{sfn|Davis|Troupe|1990|p=169}} He locked himself inside the guest house \"for about seven or eight days\" until he had gone through withdrawal.

Davis was supposedly embarrassed into getting clean by this incident. He disputed this account, stating that Roach had invited him to play and that his decision to quit heroin was unrelated to the incident.

They documented the evolution of his sound with the [[Harmon mute]], also known as a [[wah-wah (music)|wah-wah]] mute, placed close to the microphone, and the use of more spacious and relaxed phrasing. He assumed a central role in [[hard bop]], which was slower than bebop, less radical in harmony and melody, and often used popular songs and American standards as starting points for improvisation. Hard bop distanced itself from cool jazz with a harder beat and music inspired by the blues.<ref>Open references to the blues in jazz playing were fairly recent. Until the middle of the 1930s, as Coleman Hawkins declared to [[Alan Lomax]] (''The Land Where the Blues Began.'' New York: Pantheon, 1993), African-American players working in white establishments would avoid references to the blues altogether.</ref> A few critics consider ''Walkin' '' (April 1954) the album that created the hard bop genre.<ref name=\"KAHN2001\"/>\n\nDavis gained a reputation for being cold, distant\u2014and easily angered. He wrote that in 1954 Sugar Ray Robinson \"was the most important thing in my life besides music\" and adopted Robinson's \"arrogant attitude.\"{{sfn|Davis|Troupe|1990|p=183}} He showed contempt for critics and the press. There were well-publicized confrontations with the public and with other musicians. An argument with [[Thelonious Monk]] during the recording of ''Bags' Groove'' was reported.<ref>Davis had asked Monk to \"lay off\" (stop playing) while he was soloing. In his autobiography, Davis says that Monk \"could not play behind a horn.\" [[Charles Mingus]] reported this, and more, in his \"Open Letter to Miles Davis.\"</ref> In mid-1954, Davis reunited with Gr\u00e9co for the first time since 1949 after she arrived in New York City for film prospects.

He convinced organizer [[George Wein]] that he should be on the bill, and Wein agreed.{{sfn|The Complete Illustrated History|2007|p=73}} The performance was praised by critics and increased his popularity among affluent white audiences.{{sfn|Morton|2005|p=27}} He tied with Dizzy Gillespie for best trumpeter in the 1955 ''Down Beat'' magazine Readers' Poll.{{sfn|Cook|2007|pp=43\u201344}}\n\n[[George Avakian]] of [[Columbia Records]] saw Davis perform at Newport and wanted to sign him to the label. Davis had one year left on his contract with Prestige, which required him to release four more albums. He signed a contract with Columbia that included a $4,000 advance (US${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|4000|1955}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars{{inflation-fn|US}}) and a condition that his recordings for Columbia would remain unreleased until his agreement with Prestige expired.{{sfn|Carr|1998|96}}{{sfn|Davis|Troupe|1990|p=192}}\n\nAt the request of Avakian, he formed the [[Miles Davis Quintet]] for a performance at [[Caf\u00e9 Bohemia]]. The quintet consisted of Davis on trumpet, Sonny Rollins on tenor saxophone, [[Red Garland]] on piano, [[Paul Chambers]] on double bass, and [[Philly Joe Jones]] on drums. Rollins was replaced by [[John Coltrane]], completing the membership of the first quintet. This group appeared on his final albums for Prestige: ''[[Cookin' with the Miles Davis Quintet]]'' (1957), ''[[Relaxin' with the Miles Davis Quintet]]'' (1958), ''[[Workin' with the Miles Davis Quintet]]'' (1960), and ''[[Steamin' with the Miles Davis Quintet]]'' (1961). The music on all four albums was recorded in two one-day sessions in 1956 with [[Rudy Van Gelder]]. Each album helped establish Davis's quintet as one of the best.{{sfn|Chambers|1998|p=223}}{{sfn|Cook|2007|p=45}}{{sfn|Carr|1998|99}}\n\nThe style of the group was an extension of their experience playing with Davis. He played long, legato, melodic lines, while Coltrane contrasted with energetic solos. Their live repertoire was a mix of bebop, standards from the [[Great American Songbook]] and pre-bop eras, and traditional tunes. They appeared on ''[['Round About Midnight]]'', Davis's first album for Columbia.\n\nIn 1956, he left his quintet temporarily to tour Europe as part of the Birdland All-Stars, which included the [[Modern Jazz Quartet]] and French and German musicians. In Paris, he reunited with Gr\u00e9co and they \"remained lovers for many years\".{{sfn|Davis|Troupe|1990|p=186}}{{sfn|Early|2001|p=215}} He then returned home, reunited his quintet and toured the US for two months. Conflict arose on tour as he grew impatient with the drug habits of Jones and Coltrane. Davis was trying to live a healthier life by exercising and reducing his alcohol. But he continued to use cocaine.{{sfn|Davis|Troupe|1990|p=209}} At the end of the tour, he fired Jones and Coltrane and replaced them with Sonny Rollins and [[Art Taylor]].{{sfn|Davis|Troupe|1990|p=214}}\n\nIn November 1957, Davis went to Paris and recorded the [[Ascenseur pour l'\u00e9chafaud (soundtrack)|soundtrack]] to ''Ascenseur pour l'\u00e9chafaud''<ref name=\"New Grove\" /> directed by [[Louis Malle]] (1958). Consisting of French session musicians [[Barney Wilen]], [[Pierre Michelot]], and [[Ren\u00e9 Urtreger]], and American drummer [[Kenny Clarke]], the group avoided a written score and instead improvised while they watched the film in a recording studio.\n\nAfter returning to New York City, Davis revived his quintet with Adderley<ref name=\"New Grove\" /> and Coltrane, who was clean from his drug habit. Now a sextet, the group recorded material in early 1958 that was released on ''[[Milestones (Miles Davis album)|Milestones]]'' (1958), an album that demonstrated Davis's interest in [[modal jazz]]. A performance by [[Les Ballets Africains]] drew him to slower, deliberate music that allowed the creation of solos from harmony rather than chords.{{sfn|The Complete Illustrated History|2007|p=97}} In this form of ballet music, the [[kalimba]] was played for a long periods on a single chord, weaving in and out of [[consonance and dissonance]].{{sfn|Early|2001|p=89}}\n\nBy May 1958, he had replaced Jones with drummer [[Jimmy Cobb]], and Red Garland left the group, leaving Davis to play piano on \"Sid's Ahead\" for the album ''Milestones''.{{sfn|Davis|Troupe|1990|p=224}} He wanted someone who could play modal jazz, so he hired [[Bill Evans]], a young, white pianist with a background in classical music.{{sfn|Davis|Troupe|1990|p=229}} Evans had an impressionistic approach to piano. His ideas greatly influenced Davis. But after eight months of touring, a tired Evans left. [[Wynton Kelly]], his replacement, brought to the group a swinging style that contrasted with Evans's delicacy. The sextet made their recording debut on ''[[Jazz Track]]'' (1958).{{sfn|Davis|Troupe|1990|p=229}}\n\n===1957\u20131963: Collaborations with Gil Evans and ''Kind of Blue''===\nBy early 1957, Davis was exhausted from recording and touring with his quintet and wished to pursue new projects. During a two-week residency in Chicago in March, the 30-year-old Davis told journalists of his intention to retire at its conclusion and revealed offers he had received to become a teacher at [[Harvard University]] and a musical director at a record label.{{sfn|Szwed|2004|p=139}}{{sfn|Carr|1998|p=107}} Avakian agreed that it was time for Davis to explore something different, but Davis rejected his suggestion of returning to his nonet as he considered that a step backward.{{sfn|Carr|1998|p=107}} Avakian then suggested that he work with a bigger ensemble, similar to ''Music for Brass'' (1957), an album of orchestral and brass-arranged music led by [[Gunther Schuller]] featuring Davis as a guest soloist.\n\nDavis accepted and worked with Gil Evans in what became a five-album collaboration from 1957 to 1962.{{sfn|Szwed|2004|p=140}} ''[[Miles Ahead (album)|Miles Ahead]]'' (1957) showcased Davis playing a flugelhorn and a rendition \"The Maids of Cadiz\" by [[L\u00e9o Delibes]], the first piece of classical music that Davis recorded. Evans devised orchestral passages as transitions, thus turning the album into one long piece of music.{{sfn|Szwed|2004|p=141}}<ref>Cook, op. cit.</ref> ''[[Porgy and Bess (Miles Davis album)|Porgy and Bess]]'' (1959) includes arrangements of pieces from George Gershwin's [[Porgy and Bess|opera]]. ''[[Sketches of Spain]]'' (1960) contained music by composers [[Joaqu\u00edn Rodrigo]] and [[Manuel de Falla]] and originals by Evans. The classical musicians had trouble improvising, while the jazz musicians couldn't handle the difficult arrangements, but the album was a critical success, selling over 120,000 copies in the US.{{sfn|The Complete Illustrated History|2007|p=108}} Davis performed with an orchestra conducted by Evans at Carnegie Hall in May 1961 to raise money for charity.{{sfn|The Complete Illustrated History|2007|p=109}} The pair's final album was ''[[Quiet Nights (Miles Davis and Gil Evans album)|Quiet Nights]]'' (1962), a collection of [[bossa nova]] songs released against their wishes. Evans stated it was only half an album and blamed the record company; Davis blamed producer [[Teo Macero]] and refused to speak to him for more than two years.{{sfn|Carr|1998|pp=192\u2013193}} Davis noted later that \"my best friend is Gil Evans\";{{sfn|Lees|2001|p=24}} their work was included in the boxed set ''[[Miles Davis & Gil Evans: The Complete Columbia Studio Recordings]]'' (1996), which won a [[Grammy Award for Best Historical Album]] and [[Grammy Award for Best Album Notes|Best Album Notes]] in 1997.\n\nIn March and April 1959, Davis recorded what many critics consider his greatest album, ''[[Kind of Blue]]'' (1959). He named the album for its mood.{{sfn|The Complete Illustrated History|2007|p=106}} He called back Bill Evans, as the music had been planned around Evans's piano style.{{sfn|Kahn|2001|p=95}} Both Davis and Evans were familiar with [[George Russell (composer)|George Russell]]'s ideas about modal jazz.{{sfn|Kahn|2001|pp=29\u201330}}{{sfn|Kahn|2001|p=74}} But Davis neglected to tell pianist Wynton Kelly that Evans was returning, so Kelly appeared on only one song, \"[[Freddie Freeloader]].\" {{sfn|Kahn|2001|p=95}} The sextet had played \"[[So What (instrumental)|So What]]\" and \"[[All Blues]]\" at performances, but the remaining three compositions they saw for the first time in the studio.\n\nReleased in August 1959, ''Kind of Blue'' was an instant success, with widespread radio airplay and rave reviews from critics.{{sfn|The Complete Illustrated History|2007|p=106}} It remains the best selling jazz album of all time.

Following auditions, he found his new band in tenor saxophonist [[George Coleman]], bassist [[Ron Carter]], pianist [[Victor Feldman]], and drummer [[Frank Butler (musician)|Frank Butler]].{{sfn|Davis|Troupe|1990|pp=260\u2013262}} By May 1963, Feldman and Butler were replaced by pianist [[Herbie Hancock]] and 17-year-old drummer [[Tony Williams (drummer)|Tony Williams]] who made Davis \"excited all over again.\"{{sfn|Davis|Troupe|1990|p=262}} With this group, Davis completed the rest of what became ''[[Seven Steps to Heaven]]'' (1963) and recorded the live albums ''[[Miles Davis in Europe]]'' (1964), ''[[My Funny Valentine (album)|My Funny Valentine]]'' (1965), and ''[[Four & More]]'' (1966). The quintet played essentially the same bebop tunes and standards that Davis's previous bands had played, but they approached them with structural and rhythmic freedom and occasionally breakneck speed.\n\nIn 1964, Coleman was replaced by saxophonist [[Sam Rivers]] until Davis persuaded [[Wayne Shorter]] to leave [[Art Blakey]]. This quintet lasted through 1968. Shorter became the group's principal composer, and the album ''E.S.P.'' (1965) was named after his composition. While touring Europe, the group made its first album, ''[[Miles in Berlin]]'' (1965).{{sfn|Einarson|2005|pp=56\u201357}}\n\nDavis needed medical attention for hip pain, which had worsened since his Japanese tour during the previous year.{{sfn|Carr|1998|p=202}} He underwent hip replacement surgery in April 1965, with bone taken from his shin, but it failed.

The quintet's approach to the new music became known as \"time no changes\"\u2014which referred to Davis's decision to depart from chordal sequences and adopt a more open approach, with the rhythm section responding to the soloists' melodies.{{sfn|Morton|2005|p=49}} Through ''Nefertiti'' the studio recordings consisted primarily of originals composed by Shorter, with occasional compositions by the other sidemen. In 1967, the group began to play their concerts in continuous sets, each tune flowing into the next, with only the melody indicating any sort of change. His bands performed this way until his hiatus in 1975.\n\n''Miles in the Sky'' and ''Filles de Kilimanjaro''\u2014which tentatively introduced electric bass, electric piano, and electric guitar on some tracks\u2014pointed the way to the [[jazz fusion|fusion]] phase of Davis's career. He also began experimenting with more rock-oriented rhythms on these records. By the time the second half of ''Filles de Kilimanjaro'' was recorded, bassist [[Dave Holland]] and pianist [[Chick Corea]] had replaced Carter and Hancock.

With a seven-piece band that included Scofield, Evans, Irving, Foster, and [[Darryl Jones]], he played a series of European performances that were positively received. In December 1984, while in Denmark, he was awarded the [[L\u00e9onie Sonning Music Prize]]. Trumpeter [[Palle Mikkelborg]] had written a contemporary classical piece titled \"Aura\" for the event which impressed Davis to the point of returning to Denmark in early 1985 to record his next studio album, ''[[Aura (Miles Davis album)|Aura]]'' (1989).{{sfn|The Complete Illustrated History|2007|p=183}} Columbia was dissatisfied with the recording and delayed its release.\n\nIn May 1985, one month into a tour, Davis signed a contract with [[Warner Bros.

Marsalis whispered into Davis' ear that \"someone\" had told him to do so. Davis responded by ordering him off the stage.{{sfn|Davis|Troupe|1990|p=374}} Davis had become increasingly irritated at Columbia's delay in releasing ''Aura''.
