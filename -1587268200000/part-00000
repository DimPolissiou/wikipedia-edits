Her media career began in 1980 with the radio show ''Sexually Speaking'', which continued until 1990. She has hosted several series on the [[Lifetime (TV network)|Lifetime]] Channel and other [[cable television]] networks from 1984 to 1993 and is the author of 45 books on sex and sexuality.\n\n== Early life and education ==\nWestheimer was born '''Karola Ruth Siegel''' on June 4, 1928, in Wiesenfeld (now part of [[Karlstadt am Main]]), [[Weimar Republic|Germany]], the only child of [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox Jews]], Irma (n\u00e9e Hanauer), a housekeeper, and Julius Siegel, a [[Notions (sewing)|notions]] wholesaler and son of the family for whom Irma worked.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/westheimer-ruth|title=Ruth Westheimer|publisher=JWA.org|date=March 1, 2009 |accessdate=December 18, 2016}}</ref> She was given an early grounding in [[Judaism]] by her father, who took her regularly to the synagogue in the [[Nordend (Frankfurt am Main)|Nordend]] district of [[Frankfurt]], where they lived. Her father was taken away by the Nazis a week after [[Kristallnacht]], or the Night of Broken Glass, in 1938. Westheimer cried while her father was taken away by men in gloss-finished boots, while her grandmother gave the men money and asked them to care for him. Westheimer's mother and grandmother decided that Germany was too dangerous due to the tension and Nazi violence growing, so in January 1939 they sent Westheimer on a \"[[Kindertransport|Kinder Transport]],\" a transport taking Jewish children going to Switzerland. 11-year-old Westheimer arrived at an orphanage of a Jewish charity in [[Heiden, Switzerland]], and took on the role of a caregiver and mother-like figure to the younger children there. Westheimer was not allowed to take classes at the local school, but a fellow orphan boy would sneak his textbooks to Westheimer at night so she could learn and continue her education.\n\nWhile at the orphanage, Westheimer corresponded with her mother and grandmother via letters. When the letters ceased in 1941, Westheimer knew she would not hear from them again. The details of her parents' deaths due to the Holocaust are also included in the Hulu documentary about Westheimer titled \"Ask Dr. Ruth\". Her father was killed in the [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]] concentration camp in 1942. Her mother was killed during the Holocaust, but there is no specific information about her death, or about how and when she died. In the data base at the [[Yad Vashem]] World Holocaust Remembrance Center, Westheimer's mother is categorized by the word ''verschollen'' or 'disappeared.'\n\nWestheimer decided to emigrate to British-controlled [[Mandatory Palestine]]. There, at 17, she \"first had sexual intercourse on a starry night, in a haystack, without contraception.\" She later told ''[[The New York Times]]'' that \"I am not happy about that, but I know much better now and so does everyone who listens to my radio program.\"<ref name=\"NYT\">Dullea, Georgia. \"[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE5D9103FF935A15753C1A961948260 Therapist to Therapist: Analyzing Dr. Ruth]\".

Her media career began in 1980 with the radio show ''Sexually Speaking'', which continued until 1990. She has hosted several series on the [[Lifetime (TV network)|Lifetime]] Channel and other [[cable television]] networks from 1984 to 1993 and is the author of 45 books on sex and sexuality.\n\n== Early life and education ==\nWestheimer was born '''Karola Ruth Siegel''' on June 4, 1928, in Wiesenfeld (now part of [[Karlstadt am Main]]), [[Weimar Republic|Germany]], the only child of [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox Jews]], Irma (n\u00e9e Hanauer), a housekeeper, and Julius Siegel, a [[Notions (sewing)|notions]] wholesaler and son of the family for whom Irma worked.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/westheimer-ruth|title=Ruth Westheimer|publisher=JWA.org|date=March 1, 2009 |accessdate=December 18, 2016}}</ref> She was given an early grounding in [[Judaism]] by her father, who took her regularly to the synagogue in the [[Nordend (Frankfurt am Main)|Nordend]] district of [[Frankfurt]], where they lived. Her father was taken away by the Nazis a week after [[Kristallnacht]], or the Night of Broken Glass, in 1938. Westheimer cried while her father was taken away by men in gloss-finished boots, while her grandmother gave the men money and asked them to care for him. Westheimer's mother and grandmother decided that Germany was too dangerous due to the tension and Nazi violence growing, so in January 1939 they sent Westheimer on a \"[[Kindertransport|Kinder Transport]],\" a transport taking Jewish children going to Switzerland. 11-year-old Westheimer arrived at an orphanage of a Jewish charity in [[Heiden, Switzerland]], and took on the role of a caregiver and mother-like figure to the younger children there. Westheimer was not allowed to take classes at the local school, but a fellow orphan boy would sneak his textbooks to Westheimer at night so she could learn and continue her education.\n\nWhile at the orphanage, Westheimer corresponded with her mother and grandmother via letters. When the letters ceased in 1941, Westheimer knew she would not hear from them again. The details of her parents' deaths due to the Holocaust are also included in the Hulu documentary about Westheimer titled \"Ask Dr. Ruth\". Her father was killed in the [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]] concentration camp in 1942. Her mother was killed during the Holocaust, but there is no specific information about her death, or about how and when she died. In the data base at the [[Yad Vashem]] World Holocaust Remembrance Center, Westheimer's mother is categorized by the word ''verschollen'' or 'disappeared.'\n\nWestheimer decided to emigrate to British-controlled [[Mandatory Palestine]]. There, at 17, she \"first had sexual intercourse on a starry night, in a haystack, without contraception.\" She later told ''[[The New York Times]]'' that \"I am not happy about that, but I know much better now and so does everyone who listens to my radio program.\"<ref name=\"NYT\">Dullea, Georgia. \"[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE5D9103FF935A15753C1A961948260 Therapist to Therapist: Analyzing Dr. Ruth]\".

Together these institutions have a combined enrollment of more than 70,000 students annually, creating both economic and social effects.\n\n==History==\n{{main|History of Leon County}}\nOriginally part of [[Escambia County, Florida|Escambia]] and later [[Gadsden County, Florida|Gadsden County]], Leon County was created in 1824.<ref>{{cite book|title=Publications of the Florida Historical Society|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WZQ-AAAAYAAJ&pg=RA2-PA32|year=1908|publisher=Florida Historical Society.|page=32}}</ref> It was named after [[Juan Ponce de Le\u00f3n]], the [[Spain|Spanish]] [[List of explorers|explorer]] who was the first [[Europe]]an to reach Florida.<ref>{{cite book|last=Gannett|first=Henry|title=The Origin of Certain Place Names in the United States|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9V1IAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA185|year=1905|publisher=U.S. Government Printing Office|page=185}}</ref>\n\nThe United States finally acquired this territory in the nineteenth century. In the 1830s, it attempted to conduct [[Indian Removal]] of the [[Seminole]] and [[Creek people]]s, who had migrated south to escape European-American encroachment in Georgia and Alabama. After many Seminole were forcibly removed from the area or moved south to the Everglades during the [[Seminole Wars]], planters developed cotton plantations based on enslaved labor.\n\nBy the 1850s and 1860s, Leon County had become part of the \"cotton kingdom\" of the Deep South. It ranked fifth of all [[Florida]] and [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] counties in the production of cotton from the 20 major plantations. Uniquely among Confederate capitals east of the [[Mississippi River]], in the [[American Civil War]] Tallahassee was never captured by Union forces.

According to an article written in Africology: The Journal of Pan African Studies, The library was built on the campus of Florida A&M University because the city refused the donation based on the fact that it would have to serve the black citizens.  \"The facility boasted modern amenities such as electricity, indoor plumbing and water supplied by the city. In later years, the Library served as an art gallery, religious center, and in 1976, became the founding home of the Black Archives Research Center and Museum. By functioning both as a repository for archival records and a museum for historical regalia, the center continues to render academic support to educational institutions, civic, political, religious and Museum.

According to the Leon County Public Library's website, the American Association of University Women formed the Friends of the Library organization in 1954.  The formation of the Friends of the Library was in direct response to the fact that \"Tallahassee was the only state capital in the United States not offering free public library service.\" <ref name=\"cms.leoncountyfl.gov\">Leon County. (2002-2016). Library History. Retrieved April 09, 2018, from Leon County Florida Government: http://cms.leoncountyfl.gov/Library/LibraryInformation/Library-History</ref>  One year later, the library was established in May by legislative action and was developed by citizens and civic groups.  In 1956 the first Leon County free public library opened on March 21.  The first building used to house the library was The Columns, one of the  oldest remaining antebellum homes in the Leon County area located at Park Avenue and Adams street (the building today is home of the James Madison Institute).\n\nIn order to expand library services the Junior League of Tallahassee donated a bookmobile to the library. The vehicle was later donated to the Leon County Sheriff's Office to be used as a paddy wagon for its Road Prison.\nIn 1962 the library moved to the old Elks Club building at 127 North Monroe Street. Public transit in the city of Tallahassee was desegregated by 1958, yet it would several more years before the public library system would experience integration.\n\nIn the early 70's Jefferson and Wakulla counties joined the Leon County Public Library System, forming the Leon, Jefferson, and Wakulla County Public Library System. According to the library's web site, \"Leon County provided administrative and other services to the two smaller counties, while each supported the direct costs of their library services and their share of Leon's administrative costs.\"<ref name=\"cms.leoncountyfl.gov\"/>  In 1975 the system started a branch library in the Bond community, a predominantly black community on the city's Southside. Wakulla County left the library cooperative in 1975 to start its own library system and in 1978 the main library moved to a location in Tallahassee's Northwood Mall.  Jefferson County left the library cooperative in 1980 and the library reverted to the Leon County Public Library.  In 1989 \"ground breaking was held on March 4 for a new $8.5 million main library facility with 88,000 feet of space. The site was next door to the library's original home, The Columns, which had been moved in 1971 to 100 N. Duval.\"<ref name=\"cms.leoncountyfl.gov\"/>  The new library had its grand opening in 1991 and was renamed in 1993 in honor of former Governor LeRoy Collins.\n\n==Points of interest==\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Alfred B.

In the 1830s, it attempted to conduct [[Indian Removal]] of the [[Seminole]] and [[Creek people]]s, who had migrated south to escape European-American encroachment in Georgia and Alabama. After many Seminole were forcibly removed from the area or moved south to the Everglades during the [[Seminole Wars]], planters developed cotton plantations based on enslaved labor.\n\nBy the 1850s and 1860s, Leon County had become part of the \"cotton kingdom\" of the Deep South. It ranked fifth of all [[Florida]] and [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] counties in the production of cotton from the 20 major plantations. Uniquely among Confederate capitals east of the [[Mississippi River]], in the [[American Civil War]] Tallahassee was never captured by Union forces. No Union soldiers set foot in Leon County until the [[Reconstruction Era]].\n\n==Geography==\nAccording to the [[U.S. Census Bureau]], the county has a total area of {{convert|702|sqmi}}, of which {{convert|667|sqmi}} are land and {{convert|35|sqmi}} (5.0%) are water.<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/gazetteer-files.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref> Unlike much of Florida, most of Leon County has rolling hills, part of north Florida's [[Red Hills Region]].

This library was the first and only public library in the city of Tallahassee until 1955.  The philanthropist, Andrew Carnegie offered the city of Tallahassee money to build a public library in 1906. According to an article written in Africology: The Journal of Pan African Studies, The library was built on the campus of Florida A&M University because the city refused the donation based on the fact that it would have to serve the black citizens.  \"The facility boasted modern amenities such as electricity, indoor plumbing and water supplied by the city. In later years, the Library served as an art gallery, religious center, and in 1976, became the founding home of the Black Archives Research Center and Museum. By functioning both as a repository for archival records and a museum for historical regalia, the center continues to render academic support to educational institutions, civic, political, religious and Museum. By functioning both as a repository for archival records and a museum for historical regalia, the center continues to render academic support to educational institutions, civic, political, religious and social groups, as well as, public and private businesses throughout Florida and the nation.\"<ref>{{cite journal |title=Carrie Meek - James N.

On November 17, 1978, it was added to the U.S. National Register of Historic Places.\n\nThe Carnegie Library of Tallahassee which only served the black community became the only free public library in the city until 1955.  According to the Leon County Public Library's website, the American Association of University Women formed the Friends of the Library organization in 1954.  The formation of the Friends of the Library was in direct response to the fact that \"Tallahassee was the only state capital in the United States not offering free public library service.\" <ref name=\"cms.leoncountyfl.gov\">Leon County. (2002-2016). Library History. Retrieved April 09, 2018, from Leon County Florida Government: http://cms.leoncountyfl.gov/Library/LibraryInformation/Library-History</ref>  One year later, the library was established in May by legislative action and was developed by citizens and civic groups.  In 1956 the first Leon County free public library opened on March 21.  The first building used to house the library was The Columns, one of the  oldest remaining antebellum homes in the Leon County area located at Park Avenue and Adams street (the building today is home of the James Madison Institute).\n\nIn order to expand library services the Junior League of Tallahassee donated a bookmobile to the library. The vehicle was later donated to the Leon County Sheriff's Office to be used as a paddy wagon for its Road Prison.\nIn 1962 the library moved to the old Elks Club building at 127 North Monroe Street. Public transit in the city of Tallahassee was desegregated by 1958, yet it would several more years before the public library system would experience integration.\n\nIn the early 70's Jefferson and Wakulla counties joined the Leon County Public Library System, forming the Leon, Jefferson, and Wakulla County Public Library System. According to the library's web site, \"Leon County provided administrative and other services to the two smaller counties, while each supported the direct costs of their library services and their share of Leon's administrative costs.\"<ref name=\"cms.leoncountyfl.gov\"/>  In 1975 the system started a branch library in the Bond community, a predominantly black community on the city's Southside. Wakulla County left the library cooperative in 1975 to start its own library system and in 1978 the main library moved to a location in Tallahassee's Northwood Mall.  Jefferson County left the library cooperative in 1980 and the library reverted to the Leon County Public Library.  In 1989 \"ground breaking was held on March 4 for a new $8.5 million main library facility with 88,000 feet of space. The site was next door to the library's original home, The Columns, which had been moved in 1971 to 100 N. Duval.\"<ref name=\"cms.leoncountyfl.gov\"/>  The new library had its grand opening in 1991 and was renamed in 1993 in honor of former Governor LeRoy Collins.\n\n==Points of interest==\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Alfred B.
