During his first three years in [[Toronto]], he also held a joint appointment with the [[Clarke Institute of Psychiatry]] where he working with [[D.B. Coates]], M.D., co-directing the \"Yorklea Study\" in the Toronto borough of East York. This first East York study, with data collected in 1968, attempted to do a field study of a large population, linking interpersonal relations with psychiatric symptoms. This early study of \"[[social support]]\" documented the prevalence of non-local [[friendship]] and [[kinship]] ties, demonstrating that community is no longer confined to [[neighborhood]] and studying non-local communities as [[social network]]s. Wellman's \"The Community Question\" paper, reporting on this study, has been selected as one of the seven most important articles in English-Canadian sociology.<ref>[[Claude Fischer]], ''To Dwell among Friends: Personal Networks in Town and City.''

Thus his work has expanded his interest in non-local communities and social networks to encompass the Internet, [[cellphones|mobile phones]] and other information and communication technologies.\n\n===Work networks and ICTs===\nWellman's initial project (\"Cavecat\" which morphed into \"[[Telepresence]]\") was in collaboration with [[Ronald Baecker]], [[Caroline Haythornthwaite]], Marilyn Mantei, Gale Moore, and Janet Salaff. This effort in the early 1990s was done before the widespread popularity of the Internet, to use networked PCs for [[videoconferencing]] and computer supported collaborative work ([[CSCW]]).<ref>Marilyn Mantei, Ronald Baecker, William Buxton, Thomas Milligan, Abigail Sellen and Barry Wellman. \"Experiences in the Use of a Media Space.\" 1992.

Their research in one high-tech American organization &ndash; heavily dependent on [[instant messaging]] and [[e-mail]] &ndash; showed that the supposed ICT-driven transformation of work to [[Network-centric organization|networked organizations]] was only partially fulfilled in practice. The organizational constraints of departmental organization (including power) and physical proximity continued to play important roles. There were strong norms in the organization for when different communication media were used, with face-to-face contact intertwined with online contact.<ref>Anabel Quan-Haase and Barry Wellman. \"Hyperconnected Net Work: Computer-Mediated Community in a High-Tech Organization.\" Pp. 281-333 in ''The Firm as a Collaborative Community: Reconstructing Trust in the Knowledge Economy'', edited by Charles Heckscher and Paul Adler.

He published several papers (alone and with associates) arguing the need to contextualize Internet research, and proposing that online relations &ndash; like off-line &ndash; would be best studied as ramified social networks rather than as bounded groups.<ref>Barry Wellman and Milena Gulia. \"Net Surfers Don't Ride Alone: Virtual Communities as Communities.\" Pp. 167-94 in ''Communities in Cyberspace'', edited by Marc Smith and Peter edited by Barry Wellman.

Cambridge, MA: MIT Press.</ref> This argument culminated in a 2002 book, ''The Internet in Everyday Life'' (co-edited with [[Caroline Haythornthwaite]]), providing exemplification from studies in a number of social milieus.\n\nWellman did empirical work in this area: he was part of a team (led by James Witte) that surveyed visitors to the [[National Geographic Society]]'s website in 1998 and used these data to counter the [[dystopia]]n argument that Internet involvement was associated with [[social isolation]].<ref>Wenhong Chen, Jeffrey Boase and Barry Wellman. 2002. \"The Global Villagers: Comparing the Users and Uses of the Internet Around the World.\" Pp. 74-113 in ''The Internet in Everyday Life'', edited by Barry Wellman and Caroline Haythornthwaite.

Oxford: Blackwell.\n</ref>\n\nThe large U.S. national random-sample survey analyzed in the Pew Internet report, \"The Strength of Internet Ties\" (with Jeffrey Boase, John B. Horrigan and Lee Rainie) also showed a positive association between communication online and communication by telephone and face-to-face. The study showed that email is well-suited for maintaining regular contact with large networks, and especially with relationships that are only somewhat strong. The study also found that Internet users get more help than non-users from friends and relatives.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.pewinternet.org/~/media//Files/Reports/2006/PIP_Internet_ties.pdf.pdf |title=Strength of Internet Ties |access-date=2009-07-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090713151448/http://www.pewinternet.org/~/media//Files/Reports/2006/PIP_Internet_ties.pdf.pdf |archive-date=2009-07-13 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nResearch into the \"[[glocalization]]\" concept also fed into this intellectual stream. [[Keith Hampton]] and Wellman studied the [[Toronto]] suburb of \"Netville\", a pseudonym. It showed the interplay between online and offline activity, and how the Internet &ndash; aided by a list-serve &ndash; is not just a means of long-distance communication but enhances neighboring and civic involvement.<ref>Keith Hampton and Barry Wellman. 2003. \"Neighboring in Netville: How the Internet Supports Community and Social Capital in a Wired Suburb.\" ''City and Community'' 2, 3 (Fall): 277-311. {{doi|10.1046/j.1535-6841.2003.00057.x}} Keith Hampton and Barry Wellman. 2002. \"The Not So Global Village of Netville.\" Pp. 345-71 in ''The Internet in Everyday Life'', edited by Barry Wellman and Caroline Haythornthwaite.

Coates]], M.D., co-directing the \"Yorklea Study\" in the Toronto borough of East York. This first East York study, with data collected in 1968, attempted to do a field study of a large population, linking interpersonal relations with psychiatric symptoms. This early study of \"[[social support]]\" documented the prevalence of non-local [[friendship]] and [[kinship]] ties, demonstrating that community is no longer confined to [[neighborhood]] and studying non-local communities as [[social network]]s. Wellman's \"The Community Question\" paper, reporting on this study, has been selected as one of the seven most important articles in English-Canadian sociology.<ref>[[Claude Fischer]], ''To Dwell among Friends: Personal Networks in Town and City.''

Thus his work has expanded his interest in non-local communities and social networks to encompass the Internet, [[cellphones|mobile phones]] and other information and communication technologies.\n\n===Work networks and ICTs===\nWellman's initial project (\"Cavecat\" which morphed into \"[[Telepresence]]\") was in collaboration with [[Ronald Baecker]], [[Caroline Haythornthwaite]], Marilyn Mantei, Gale Moore, and Janet Salaff. This effort in the early 1990s was done before the widespread popularity of the Internet, to use networked PCs for [[videoconferencing]] and computer supported collaborative work ([[CSCW]]).<ref>Marilyn Mantei, Ronald Baecker, William Buxton, Thomas Milligan, Abigail Sellen and Barry Wellman. \"Experiences in the Use of a Media Space.\" 1992.

They discovered that friendships as well as collaborative work were prime movers of connectivity at work.<ref>[[Caroline Haythornthwaite]] and Barry Wellman, \"Work, Friendship and Media Use for Information Exchange in a Networked Organization.\" ''Journal of the American Society for Information Science'' 49, 12 (Oct., 1998): 1101-1114.

San Diego: Academic Press, 1998.</ref>\n\nWellman and Anabel Quan-Haase also studied whether such computer-supported work teams were supporting networked organizations, in which bureaucratic structure and physical proximity did not matter. Their research in one high-tech American organization &ndash; heavily dependent on [[instant messaging]] and [[e-mail]] &ndash; showed that the supposed ICT-driven transformation of work to [[Network-centric organization|networked organizations]] was only partially fulfilled in practice. The organizational constraints of departmental organization (including power) and physical proximity continued to play important roles. There were strong norms in the organization for when different communication media were used, with face-to-face contact intertwined with online contact.<ref>Anabel Quan-Haase and Barry Wellman. \"Hyperconnected Net Work: Computer-Mediated Community in a High-Tech Organization.\" Pp. 281-333 in ''The Firm as a Collaborative Community: Reconstructing Trust in the Knowledge Economy'', edited by Charles Heckscher and Paul Adler.

They discovered that despite the emphasis on networking, disciplinary and spatial boundaries continue to affect who interacts with whom.<ref>Barry Wellman, Dimitrina Dimitrova, Tsahi Hayat, Guang Ying Mo, and Beverly Wellman. 2017. \"Fifteen Implications of Networked Scholar Research for Networked Work.\" ''International Journal of Communication'', 11: [http://ijoc.org/index.php/ijoc/article/view/7290/2033]</ref>\n\n===Community networks and ICTs===\nAs a community sociologist, Wellman began arguing that too much analysis of life online was happening in isolation from other aspects of everyday life. He published several papers (alone and with associates) arguing the need to contextualize Internet research, and proposing that online relations &ndash; like off-line &ndash; would be best studied as ramified social networks rather than as bounded groups.<ref>Barry Wellman and Milena Gulia. \"Net Surfers Don't Ride Alone: Virtual Communities as Communities.\" Pp. 167-94 in ''Communities in Cyberspace'', edited by Marc Smith and Peter edited by Barry Wellman.

Cambridge, MA: MIT Press.</ref> This argument culminated in a 2002 book, ''The Internet in Everyday Life'' (co-edited with [[Caroline Haythornthwaite]]), providing exemplification from studies in a number of social milieus.\n\nWellman did empirical work in this area: he was part of a team (led by James Witte) that surveyed visitors to the [[National Geographic Society]]'s website in 1998 and used these data to counter the [[dystopia]]n argument that Internet involvement was associated with [[social isolation]].<ref>Wenhong Chen, Jeffrey Boase and Barry Wellman. 2002. \"The Global Villagers: Comparing the Users and Uses of the Internet Around the World.\" Pp. 74-113 in ''The Internet in Everyday Life'', edited by Barry Wellman and Caroline Haythornthwaite.

Oxford: Blackwell.\n</ref>\n\nThe large U.S. national random-sample survey analyzed in the Pew Internet report, \"The Strength of Internet Ties\" (with Jeffrey Boase, John B. Horrigan and Lee Rainie) also showed a positive association between communication online and communication by telephone and face-to-face. The study showed that email is well-suited for maintaining regular contact with large networks, and especially with relationships that are only somewhat strong. The study also found that Internet users get more help than non-users from friends and relatives.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.pewinternet.org/~/media//Files/Reports/2006/PIP_Internet_ties.pdf.pdf |title=Strength of Internet Ties |access-date=2009-07-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090713151448/http://www.pewinternet.org/~/media//Files/Reports/2006/PIP_Internet_ties.pdf.pdf |archive-date=2009-07-13 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nResearch into the \"[[glocalization]]\" concept also fed into this intellectual stream. [[Keith Hampton]] and Wellman studied the [[Toronto]] suburb of \"Netville\", a pseudonym. It showed the interplay between online and offline activity, and how the Internet &ndash; aided by a list-serve &ndash; is not just a means of long-distance communication but enhances neighboring and civic involvement.<ref>Keith Hampton and Barry Wellman. 2003. \"Neighboring in Netville: How the Internet Supports Community and Social Capital in a Wired Suburb.\" ''City and Community'' 2, 3 (Fall): 277-311. {{doi|10.1046/j.1535-6841.2003.00057.x}} Keith Hampton and Barry Wellman. 2002. \"The Not So Global Village of Netville.\" Pp. 345-71 in ''The Internet in Everyday Life'', edited by Barry Wellman and Caroline Haythornthwaite.

The previous version delayed page loading, and so, for performance reasons, it was generally placed just before the <code><nowiki></body></nowiki></code> body close HTML tag. The new code can be placed between the <code><nowiki><head>...</head></nowiki></code> HTML head tags because, once triggered, it runs in parallel with page loading.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://online-behavior.com/analytics/google-tag-manager|title=Google Tag Manager: A Step-By-Step Guide {{!}} Analytics & Optimization|website=online-behavior.com|access-date=2016-03-17}}</ref> In April 2011 Google announced the availability of a new version of Google Analytics featuring multiple dashboards, more custom report options, and a new interface design.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://analytics.blogspot.com/2011/04/new-google-analytics-available-to.html | title = The New Google Analytics Available to Everyone }}</ref> This version was later updated with some other features such as real-time analytics and [[goal]] flow charts.<ref name=\"GoogleBlogHappening2011\" /><ref>{{cite web | url = http://analytics.blogspot.com/2011/10/introducing-flow-visualization.html | title = Introducing Flow Visualization: visualizing visitor flow }}</ref>\n\nIn October 2012 another new version of Google Analytics was announced, called ''Universal Analytics.''<ref>{{cite web | url=http://analytics.blogspot.com/2012/10/universal-analytics.html | title=Re-imagining Google Analytics to support the versatile usage patterns of today's users}}</ref> The key differences from the previous versions were: cross-platform tracking, flexible tracking code to collect data from any device, and the introduction of custom dimensions and custom metrics.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/2790010?hl=en|title=About Universal Analytics - Analytics Help|website=support.google.com}}</ref>\n\nIn March 2016, Google released ''Google Analytics 360'', which is a [[software suite]] that provides analytics on [[return on investment]] and other marketing indicators. Google Analytics 360 includes five main products: Analytics, Tag Manager, Optimize, Data Studio, Surveys, Attribution, and Audience Center.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.blog.google/products/marketingplatform/360/introducing-google-analytics-360-suite/|title=Introducing the Google Analytics 360 suite|website=Google|last=Muret|first=Paul|date=2016-03-15|accessdate=2018-10-07}}</ref>\n\nIn October 2017 a new version of Google Analytics was announced, called ''Global Site Tag''. Its stated purpose was to unify the tagging system to simplify implementation.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/gtagjs/ | title=Add gtag.js to your site}}</ref>\n\nIn June 2018, Google introduced ''Google Marketing Platform'', an [[Online advertising|online advertisement]] and [[Online analytical processing|analytics]] brand.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.blog.google/technology/ads/new-advertising-brands/|title=Introducing simpler brands and solutions for advertisers and publishers|date=2018-06-27|work=Google|access-date=2018-07-27|language=en}}</ref> It consists of two former brands of Google, [[DoubleClick|DoubleClick Digital Marketing]] and Google Analytics 360.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://variety.com/2018/digital/news/google-doubleclick-adwords-rebranding-1202859088/|title=Google Killing Off DoubleClick, AdWords Names in Rebranding of Ad Products|last=Spangler|first=Todd|date=2018-06-27|work=Variety|access-date=2018-07-27|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n==Technology==\n{{Refimprove section|date=November 2007}}\nGoogle Analytics is implemented with \"[[Web beacon|page tag]]s\", in this case, called the Google Analytics Tracking Code,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.matthewwoodward.co.uk/seo/reporting/google-analytics-event-tracking/?unapproved=2220589&moderation-hash=3f6ed00ccc19a7132d4fd61312754533#comment-2220589|title=How To Use Google Analytics Event Tracking|last=|first=|date=January 9, 2020|website=Matthew Woodward|publisher=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=|layurl=}}</ref> which is a snippet of [[JavaScript]] code that the website owner adds to every page of the website. The tracking code runs in the client browser when the client browses the page (if JavaScript is enabled in the browser) and collects visitor data and sends it to a Google data collection [[Server (computing)|server]] as part of a request for a [[web beacon]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://developers.google.com/analytics/resources/concepts/gaConceptsTrackingOverview|title=Tracking Code Overview &#124; Google Analytics|website=Google Developers}}</ref>\n\nThe tracking code loads a larger [[JavaScript]] file from the [[Google web server]] and then sets variables with the user's account number. The larger file (currently known as ga.js) was typically 40&nbsp;kB as of May 2018.\n\nThe file does not usually have to be loaded, however, due to browser caching. Assuming caching is enabled in the browser, it downloads ga.js only once at the start of the visit. Furthermore, as all websites that implement Google Analytics with the ga.js code use the same master file from Google, a browser that has previously visited any other website running Google Analytics will already have the file cached on their machine.\n\nIn addition to transmitting information to a Google server, the tracking code sets a [[Web analytics#Problems with cookies|first party cookie]] (If [[HTTP cookie|cookies]] are enabled in the browser) on each visitor's computer. This cookie stores anonymous information called the ClientId.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/analyticsjs/domains |title=Cookies and User Identification |website=developers.google.com}}</ref> Before the launch of Universal Analytics, there were several cookies storing information such as whether the visitor had been to the site before (new or returning visitor), the [[timestamp]] of the current visit, and the [[referrer]] site or campaign that directed the visitor to the page (e.g., [[Web search engine|search engine]], keywords, banner, or [[email]]).\n\nIf the visitor arrived at the site by clicking on a link tagged with {{anchor|Urchin Traffic Monitor}}[[UTM parameters]] (Urchin Tracking Module) such as:\n:<nowiki>https://www.example.com/page</nowiki>?<mark>utm_content=buffercf3b2&utm_medium=social&utm_source=facebook.com&utm_campaign=buffer</mark>\n\nthen the tag values are passed to the database too.\n\n===Limitations===\nIn addition, Google Analytics for Mobile Package allows Google Analytics to be applied to mobile websites. The Mobile Package contains server-side tracking codes that use [[PHP]], [[JavaServer Pages]], [[ASP.NET]], or [[Perl]] for its server-side language.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://code.google.com/intl/en/mobile/analytics/docs/web/ |title=Google Analytics for Mobile package |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130124153755/http://code.google.com/intl/en/mobile/analytics/docs/web/ |archivedate=2013-01-24 }}</ref> However, many [[ad filtering]] programs and extensions such as [[Firefox]]'s Enhanced Tracking Protection,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/enhanced-tracking-protection-firefox-desktop#w_what-enhanced-tracking-protection-blocks|title=Enhanced Tracking Protection in Firefox for desktop {{!}} Firefox Help|website=support.mozilla.org|access-date=2020-03-26}}</ref> the browser extension [[NoScript]] and the mobile phone app [[Disconnect Mobile]] can block the Google Analytics Tracking Code. This prevents some traffic and users from being tracked and leads to holes in the collected data. Also, privacy networks like [[Tor (anonymity network)|Tor]] will mask the user's actual location and present inaccurate geographical data. A small fraction of users don't have JavaScript-enabled/capable browsers or turn this feature off.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://blockmetry.com/blog/javascript-disabled|title=What percentage of browsers with javascript disabled? - Blockmetry|website=blockmetry.com|access-date=2019-06-07}}</ref> These limitations, mainly ad filtering programs, can allow a significant amount of visitors to avoid the tracker, sometimes more than the majority.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Chetty|first=Marshini|last2=Narayanan|first2=Arvind|last3=Vitak|first3=Jessica|last4=Mathur|first4=Arunesh|date=2018|title=Characterizing the Use of Browser-Based Blocking Extensions To Prevent Online Tracking|url=https://www.usenix.org/conference/soups2018/presentation/mathur|language=en|pages=103\u2013116|isbn=9781939133106}}</ref>\n\nOne potential impact on data accuracy comes from users deleting or blocking Google Analytics cookies.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.advanced-web-metrics.com/blog/2008/02/16/accuracy-whitepaper/ | title = Accuracy Whitepaper for web analytics | author = Brian Clifton}}</ref> Without cookies being set, Google Analytics cannot collect data.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} Any individual web user can block or delete cookies resulting in the data loss of those visits for Google Analytics users. Website owners can encourage users not to disable cookies; for example, by making visitors more comfortable using the site through posting a [[privacy policy]]. These limitations affect the majority of [[web analytics]] tools which use page tags (usually [[JavaScript]] programs) embedded in web pages to collect visitor data, store it in cookies on the visitor's computer, and transmit it to a remote database by pretending to load a tiny graphic \"[[Web bug|beacon]]\".{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\nAnother limitation of Google Analytics for large websites is the use of [[Sampling (statistics)|sampling]] in the generation of many of its reports. To reduce the load on their servers and to provide users with a relatively quick response to their query, Google Analytics limits reports to 500,000 randomly sampled sessions at the profile level for its calculations. While [[Margin of error|margins of error]] are indicated for the visits metric, margins of error are not provided for any other metrics in the Google Analytics reports. For small segments of data, the margin of error can be very large.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.epikone.com/blog/2009/04/21/segmentation-options-in-google-analytics/ |title=Segmentation Options in Google Analytics |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090622173444/http://www.epikone.com/blog/2009/04/21/segmentation-options-in-google-analytics/ |archivedate=2009-06-22 }}</ref>\n\n==Performance==\nThere have been several online discussions about the impact of Google Analytics on site performance.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://groups.google.com/group/analytics-help-basics/browse_thread/thread/62997a00d5a50406?pli=1|title=Google Groups}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.analyticsmarket.com/blog/tracking-code-slows-my-site|title=Google Analytics Code is Slowing Down My Site - Analytics Market|publisher=|date=2019-01-27}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.woopra.com/blog/2009/02/04/is-google-analytics-slow-or-not/|title=Is Google Analytics Slow or Not? \u2014 Woopra|date=4 February 2009|access-date=8 August 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100215174004/http://www.woopra.com/blog/2009/02/04/is-google-analytics-slow-or-not/|archive-date=15 February 2010|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> However, Google introduced asynchronous JavaScript code in December 2009 to reduce the risk of slowing the loading of pages tagged with the ga.js script.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://googlecode.blogspot.com/2009/12/google-analytics-launches-asynchronous.html|title=Google Analytics Launches Asynchronous Tracking - The official Google Code blog|date=1 December 2009|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://analytics.googleblog.com/2010/04/making-web-faster.html|title=Making the Web Faster|publisher=}}</ref>\n<!-- Google Analytics has introduced new user interface in 2011- 2012 period.

However, due to extremely high demand for the service, new sign-ups were suspended only a week later. As capacity was added to the system, Google began using a [[lottery]]-type invitation-code model. Before August 2006, Google was sending out batches of invitation codes as server availability permitted; since mid-August 2006 the service has been fully available to all users \u2013 whether they use Google for advertising or not.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://sites.google.com/site/zenbatetanola/02-google-analytics|title=Google Analytics - zenbatetanola|website=sites.google.com|access-date=2016-03-17}}</ref>\n\nThe newer version of Google Analytics tracking code is known as the asynchronous tracking code,<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.google.com/support/analytics/bin/answer.py?answer=161379 | title = Asynchronous Tracking Code }}</ref> which Google claims is significantly more sensitive and accurate, and is able to track even very short activities on the website. The previous version delayed page loading, and so, for performance reasons, it was generally placed just before the <code><nowiki></body></nowiki></code> body close HTML tag. The new code can be placed between the <code><nowiki><head>...</head></nowiki></code> HTML head tags because, once triggered, it runs in parallel with page loading.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://online-behavior.com/analytics/google-tag-manager|title=Google Tag Manager: A Step-By-Step Guide {{!}} Analytics & Optimization|website=online-behavior.com|access-date=2016-03-17}}</ref> In April 2011 Google announced the availability of a new version of Google Analytics featuring multiple dashboards, more custom report options, and a new interface design.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://analytics.blogspot.com/2011/04/new-google-analytics-available-to.html | title = The New Google Analytics Available to Everyone }}</ref> This version was later updated with some other features such as real-time analytics and [[goal]] flow charts.<ref name=\"GoogleBlogHappening2011\" /><ref>{{cite web | url = http://analytics.blogspot.com/2011/10/introducing-flow-visualization.html | title = Introducing Flow Visualization: visualizing visitor flow }}</ref>\n\nIn October 2012 another new version of Google Analytics was announced, called ''Universal Analytics.''<ref>{{cite web | url=http://analytics.blogspot.com/2012/10/universal-analytics.html | title=Re-imagining Google Analytics to support the versatile usage patterns of today's users}}</ref> The key differences from the previous versions were: cross-platform tracking, flexible tracking code to collect data from any device, and the introduction of custom dimensions and custom metrics.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/2790010?hl=en|title=About Universal Analytics - Analytics Help|website=support.google.com}}</ref>\n\nIn March 2016, Google released ''Google Analytics 360'', which is a [[software suite]] that provides analytics on [[return on investment]] and other marketing indicators. Google Analytics 360 includes five main products: Analytics, Tag Manager, Optimize, Data Studio, Surveys, Attribution, and Audience Center.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.blog.google/products/marketingplatform/360/introducing-google-analytics-360-suite/|title=Introducing the Google Analytics 360 suite|website=Google|last=Muret|first=Paul|date=2016-03-15|accessdate=2018-10-07}}</ref>\n\nIn October 2017 a new version of Google Analytics was announced, called ''Global Site Tag''. Its stated purpose was to unify the tagging system to simplify implementation.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/gtagjs/ | title=Add gtag.js to your site}}</ref>\n\nIn June 2018, Google introduced ''Google Marketing Platform'', an [[Online advertising|online advertisement]] and [[Online analytical processing|analytics]] brand.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.blog.google/technology/ads/new-advertising-brands/|title=Introducing simpler brands and solutions for advertisers and publishers|date=2018-06-27|work=Google|access-date=2018-07-27|language=en}}</ref> It consists of two former brands of Google, [[DoubleClick|DoubleClick Digital Marketing]] and Google Analytics 360.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://variety.com/2018/digital/news/google-doubleclick-adwords-rebranding-1202859088/|title=Google Killing Off DoubleClick, AdWords Names in Rebranding of Ad Products|last=Spangler|first=Todd|date=2018-06-27|work=Variety|access-date=2018-07-27|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n==Technology==\n{{Refimprove section|date=November 2007}}\nGoogle Analytics is implemented with \"[[Web beacon|page tag]]s\", in this case, called the Google Analytics Tracking Code,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.matthewwoodward.co.uk/seo/reporting/google-analytics-event-tracking/?unapproved=2220589&moderation-hash=3f6ed00ccc19a7132d4fd61312754533#comment-2220589|title=How To Use Google Analytics Event Tracking|last=|first=|date=January 9, 2020|website=Matthew Woodward|publisher=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=|layurl=}}</ref> which is a snippet of [[JavaScript]] code that the website owner adds to every page of the website. The tracking code runs in the client browser when the client browses the page (if JavaScript is enabled in the browser) and collects visitor data and sends it to a Google data collection [[Server (computing)|server]] as part of a request for a [[web beacon]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://developers.google.com/analytics/resources/concepts/gaConceptsTrackingOverview|title=Tracking Code Overview &#124; Google Analytics|website=Google Developers}}</ref>\n\nThe tracking code loads a larger [[JavaScript]] file from the [[Google web server]] and then sets variables with the user's account number. The larger file (currently known as ga.js) was typically 40&nbsp;kB as of May 2018.\n\nThe file does not usually have to be loaded, however, due to browser caching. Assuming caching is enabled in the browser, it downloads ga.js only once at the start of the visit. Furthermore, as all websites that implement Google Analytics with the ga.js code use the same master file from Google, a browser that has previously visited any other website running Google Analytics will already have the file cached on their machine.\n\nIn addition to transmitting information to a Google server, the tracking code sets a [[Web analytics#Problems with cookies|first party cookie]] (If [[HTTP cookie|cookies]] are enabled in the browser) on each visitor's computer. This cookie stores anonymous information called the ClientId.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/analyticsjs/domains |title=Cookies and User Identification |website=developers.google.com}}</ref> Before the launch of Universal Analytics, there were several cookies storing information such as whether the visitor had been to the site before (new or returning visitor), the [[timestamp]] of the current visit, and the [[referrer]] site or campaign that directed the visitor to the page (e.g., [[Web search engine|search engine]], keywords, banner, or [[email]]).\n\nIf the visitor arrived at the site by clicking on a link tagged with {{anchor|Urchin Traffic Monitor}}[[UTM parameters]] (Urchin Tracking Module) such as:\n:<nowiki>https://www.example.com/page</nowiki>?<mark>utm_content=buffercf3b2&utm_medium=social&utm_source=facebook.com&utm_campaign=buffer</mark>\n\nthen the tag values are passed to the database too.\n\n===Limitations===\nIn addition, Google Analytics for Mobile Package allows Google Analytics to be applied to mobile websites. The Mobile Package contains server-side tracking codes that use [[PHP]], [[JavaServer Pages]], [[ASP.NET]], or [[Perl]] for its server-side language.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://code.google.com/intl/en/mobile/analytics/docs/web/ |title=Google Analytics for Mobile package |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130124153755/http://code.google.com/intl/en/mobile/analytics/docs/web/ |archivedate=2013-01-24 }}</ref> However, many [[ad filtering]] programs and extensions such as [[Firefox]]'s Enhanced Tracking Protection,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/enhanced-tracking-protection-firefox-desktop#w_what-enhanced-tracking-protection-blocks|title=Enhanced Tracking Protection in Firefox for desktop {{!}} Firefox Help|website=support.mozilla.org|access-date=2020-03-26}}</ref> the browser extension [[NoScript]] and the mobile phone app [[Disconnect Mobile]] can block the Google Analytics Tracking Code. This prevents some traffic and users from being tracked and leads to holes in the collected data. Also, privacy networks like [[Tor (anonymity network)|Tor]] will mask the user's actual location and present inaccurate geographical data. A small fraction of users don't have JavaScript-enabled/capable browsers or turn this feature off.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://blockmetry.com/blog/javascript-disabled|title=What percentage of browsers with javascript disabled? - Blockmetry|website=blockmetry.com|access-date=2019-06-07}}</ref> These limitations, mainly ad filtering programs, can allow a significant amount of visitors to avoid the tracker, sometimes more than the majority.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Chetty|first=Marshini|last2=Narayanan|first2=Arvind|last3=Vitak|first3=Jessica|last4=Mathur|first4=Arunesh|date=2018|title=Characterizing the Use of Browser-Based Blocking Extensions To Prevent Online Tracking|url=https://www.usenix.org/conference/soups2018/presentation/mathur|language=en|pages=103\u2013116|isbn=9781939133106}}</ref>\n\nOne potential impact on data accuracy comes from users deleting or blocking Google Analytics cookies.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.advanced-web-metrics.com/blog/2008/02/16/accuracy-whitepaper/ | title = Accuracy Whitepaper for web analytics | author = Brian Clifton}}</ref> Without cookies being set, Google Analytics cannot collect data.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} Any individual web user can block or delete cookies resulting in the data loss of those visits for Google Analytics users. Website owners can encourage users not to disable cookies; for example, by making visitors more comfortable using the site through posting a [[privacy policy]]. These limitations affect the majority of [[web analytics]] tools which use page tags (usually [[JavaScript]] programs) embedded in web pages to collect visitor data, store it in cookies on the visitor's computer, and transmit it to a remote database by pretending to load a tiny graphic \"[[Web bug|beacon]]\".{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\nAnother limitation of Google Analytics for large websites is the use of [[Sampling (statistics)|sampling]] in the generation of many of its reports. To reduce the load on their servers and to provide users with a relatively quick response to their query, Google Analytics limits reports to 500,000 randomly sampled sessions at the profile level for its calculations. While [[Margin of error|margins of error]] are indicated for the visits metric, margins of error are not provided for any other metrics in the Google Analytics reports. For small segments of data, the margin of error can be very large.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.epikone.com/blog/2009/04/21/segmentation-options-in-google-analytics/ |title=Segmentation Options in Google Analytics |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090622173444/http://www.epikone.com/blog/2009/04/21/segmentation-options-in-google-analytics/ |archivedate=2009-06-22 }}</ref>\n\n==Performance==\nThere have been several online discussions about the impact of Google Analytics on site performance.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://groups.google.com/group/analytics-help-basics/browse_thread/thread/62997a00d5a50406?pli=1|title=Google Groups}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.analyticsmarket.com/blog/tracking-code-slows-my-site|title=Google Analytics Code is Slowing Down My Site - Analytics Market|publisher=|date=2019-01-27}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.woopra.com/blog/2009/02/04/is-google-analytics-slow-or-not/|title=Is Google Analytics Slow or Not? \u2014 Woopra|date=4 February 2009|access-date=8 August 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100215174004/http://www.woopra.com/blog/2009/02/04/is-google-analytics-slow-or-not/|archive-date=15 February 2010|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> However, Google introduced asynchronous JavaScript code in December 2009 to reduce the risk of slowing the loading of pages tagged with the ga.js script.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://googlecode.blogspot.com/2009/12/google-analytics-launches-asynchronous.html|title=Google Analytics Launches Asynchronous Tracking - The official Google Code blog|date=1 December 2009|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://analytics.googleblog.com/2010/04/making-web-faster.html|title=Making the Web Faster|publisher=}}</ref>\n<!-- Google Analytics has introduced new user interface in 2011- 2012 period.

W.|last=Millner|first2=Ann|last2= Montgomery-Smith|date=2000|title=Information and Communication technology for Intermediate Gnvq.|page= 126}}</ref>\n\nIn the early days of computing{{when|date=January 2019}} most application software was custom-written by computer users to fit their specific hardware and requirements. In contrast, system software was usually supplied by the manufacturer of the computer hardware and was intended to be used by most or all users of that system.\n\nThe line where the distinction should be drawn is not always clear.{{according to whom|date=January 2019}} Many operating systems bundle{{technical statement|date=January 2019}} application software. Such software is not considered ''system software'' when it can be uninstalled usually without affecting the functioning of other software. Exceptions could be e.g. [[web browser]]s such as [[Internet Explorer]] where [[Microsoft]] argued in court that it was system software that could not be uninstalled. Later examples are [[Chrome OS]] and [[Firefox OS]] where the browser functions as the only user interface ''and'' the only way to run programs (and other web browsers can not be installed in their place), then they can well be argued to ''be'' (part of) the operating system and hence system software.\n\nAnother borderline example is cloud-based software. This software provides services to a software client (usually a web browser or a JavaScript application running in the web browser), not to the user directly, and is therefore systems software. It is also developed using [[system programming]] methodologies and [[systems programming language]]s. Yet from the perspective of functionality there is little difference between a word processing application and word processing web application.\n\n==Operating systems or system control  program==\nThe ''[[operating system]]'' (prominent examples being [[Microsoft Windows]], [[macOS]], [[Linux]], and [[z/OS]]), allows the parts of a computer to work together by performing tasks like transferring [[data (computing)|data]] between [[random access memory|memory]] and [[disk storage|disks]] or rendering output onto a [[display device]]. It provides a platform ([[Hardware abstraction|hardware abstraction layer]]) to run high-level system software and [[application software]].\n\nA ''[[Kernel (computing)|kernel]]'' is the core part of the operating system that defines an [[Application programming interface|API]] for applications programs (including some system software) and an interface to device drivers.\n\n''[[Device driver]]s'', including also computer [[BIOS]] and device [[firmware]], provide basic functionality to operate and control the hardware connected to or built into the computer.\n\nA ''user interface'' \"allows users to interact with a computer.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Daeryong|first=Kim|title=Microcomputer Information Technology|url=http://home.olemiss.edu/~misbook/sfsysfm.htm|accessdate=2013-09-22}}</ref> Either a [[command-line interface]] (CLI) or, since the 1980s a [[graphical user interface]] (GUI).

W.|last=Millner|first2=Ann|last2= Montgomery-Smith|date=2000|title=Information and Communication technology for Intermediate Gnvq.|page= 126}}</ref>\n\nIn the early days of computing{{when|date=January 2019}} most application software was custom-written by computer users to fit their specific hardware and requirements. In contrast, system software was usually supplied by the manufacturer of the computer hardware and was intended to be used by most or all users of that system.\n\nThe line where the distinction should be drawn is not always clear.{{according to whom|date=January 2019}} Many operating systems bundle{{technical statement|date=January 2019}} application software. Such software is not considered ''system software'' when it can be uninstalled usually without affecting the functioning of other software. Exceptions could be e.g. [[web browser]]s such as [[Internet Explorer]] where [[Microsoft]] argued in court that it was system software that could not be uninstalled. Later examples are [[Chrome OS]] and [[Firefox OS]] where the browser functions as the only user interface ''and'' the only way to run programs (and other web browsers can not be installed in their place), then they can well be argued to ''be'' (part of) the operating system and hence system software.\n\nAnother borderline example is cloud-based software. This software provides services to a software client (usually a web browser or a JavaScript application running in the web browser), not to the user directly, and is therefore systems software. It is also developed using [[system programming]] methodologies and [[systems programming language]]s. Yet from the perspective of functionality there is little difference between a word processing application and word processing web application.\n\n==Operating systems or system control  program==\nThe ''[[operating system]]'' (prominent examples being [[Microsoft Windows]], [[macOS]], [[Linux]], and [[z/OS]]), allows the parts of a computer to work together by performing tasks like transferring [[data (computing)|data]] between [[random access memory|memory]] and [[disk storage|disks]] or rendering output onto a [[display device]]. It provides a platform ([[Hardware abstraction|hardware abstraction layer]]) to run high-level system software and [[application software]].\n\nA ''[[Kernel (computing)|kernel]]'' is the core part of the operating system that defines an [[Application programming interface|API]] for applications programs (including some system software) and an interface to device drivers.\n\n''[[Device driver]]s'', including also computer [[BIOS]] and device [[firmware]], provide basic functionality to operate and control the hardware connected to or built into the computer.\n\nA ''user interface'' \"allows users to interact with a computer.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Daeryong|first=Kim|title=Microcomputer Information Technology|url=http://home.olemiss.edu/~misbook/sfsysfm.htm|accessdate=2013-09-22}}</ref> Either a [[command-line interface]] (CLI) or, since the 1980s a [[graphical user interface]] (GUI). Since this is the part of the operating system the user directly interacts with, it may be considered an application and therefore not system software.\n\n==Utility software or system support programs ==\n\nFor historical reasons, some organizations use the term ''systems programmer'' to describe a job function which is more accurately termed [[systems administrator]].

The hotel manager, Mr. Salamone, asks one of the staff to take the box to the package room. Two of the staff take the gift box to the package room. When they leave, the box is opened and we see Eloise crawling out. Eloise is on a mission to find any presents in the package room from her mother, who has taken a trip to Paris.\n\nWhen Eloise does not find any packages from her mother, she then leaves the room in a large mess. She skips towards the lobby, and pushes into a long line at the check-in desk and interrupts a conversation between Mr. Salamone and two patrons, wishing to upgrade their current hotel suite to a park-side view room.\n\nEloise asks Mr. Salamone if there have been any packages from her mother in Paris, and he replies that there hasn't. He pushes her away, telling Eloise that he is currently very busy. Eloise pushes in the line again, offering Mr. Salamone some unnecessary assistance. Mr. Salamone declines, pushing Eloise away from the hectic line.\n\nEloise leaves, but is instantly back in a flash, when she notices a suspicious man waiting in the queue. She thinks that this patron is a spy, but Mr. Salamone declines, and instantly changes the subject so that Eloise can leave the line. He requests Eloise to look out for the hotel's Christmas Tree Delivery, which is due to be at the Plaza any moment. He tells Eloise to inform him when the delivery arrives.\n\nEloise leaves the line, and tells the \"spy\" that she is keeping her eye on him.\n\nThe main focal point of the story deals with the impending [[marriage]] between Rachel Peabody, the hotel owner's daughter, and a bachelor named Brooks Oliver, who was chosen by Rachel's family to be her husband.\n\nEloise eventually learns that Oliver is into doing something suspicious. She also found out that Rachel had taken a liking to Bill, a room service waiter and a friend of hers, four years earlier. When Mr. Peabody learns of his daughter's relationship with Bill, he then sent his daughter to a university, hoping to break his daughter's ties with the waiter. Eloise intervenes with the relationship, much to Mr. Peabody's dismay.\n\nShe then succeeds with restoring Bill and Rachel's romance with each other; Oliver is then arrested for [[forgery]], and Mrs. Thornton, who was in danger of being [[eviction|evicted]], is granted a permanent stay at the Plaza. And to top it off, Eloise's mother arrives and they rejoice.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Julie Andrews]] as Nanny \n* [[Sofia Vassilieva]] as Eloise\n* [[Kenneth Welsh]] as Sir Wilkes\n* [[Debra Monk]] as Maggie\n* [[Gavin Creel]] as Bill\n* [[Rick Roberts (actor)|Rick Roberts]] as Brooks\n* [[Sara Topham]] as Rachel Peabody\n* [[Corinne Conley]] as Mrs. Thornton\n* [[Christine Baranski]] as Prunella Stickler\n* [[Jeffrey Tambor]] as Mr. Salomone\n* Araxi Arslanian as Head of Housekeeping\n* Tannis Burnett as Miss Thompson\n* [[Neil Crone]] as Agent Kringle\n* [[Arlene Duncan]] as Lily\n* [[Sean Gallagher (actor)|Sean Gallagher]] as Rick\n* Graham Harley as Walter\n* [[Colm Magner]] as Thomas the Maitre'd\n* [[Debra McGrath]] as Cornelia\n* [[Julian Richings]] as Patrice\n* Cliff Saunders as Max\n* Tony Sciara as Assistant Chef Marco\n* David Sparrow as Charlie, the 59th Street Doorman\n* Victor A.

The gyrator is the complement of the [[transformer]]; whereas in a transformer, a voltage on one port will transform to a proportional voltage on the other port, in a gyrator, a voltage on one port will transform to a current on the other port, and vice versa.\n\nThe role gyrators play in the gyrator\u2013capacitor model is as [[transducer]]s between the electrical energy domain and the magnetic energy domain.  An emf in the electrical domain is analogous to an mmf in the magnetic domain, and a transducer doing such a conversion would be represented as a transformer.  However, real electro-magnetic transducers usually behave as gyrators.  A transducer from the magnetic domain to the electrical domain will obey [[Faraday's law of induction]], that is, a rate of change of magnetic flux (a magnetic current in this analogy) produces a proportional emf in the electrical domain.  Similarly, a transducer from the electrical domain to the magnetic domain will obey [[Amp\u00e8re's circuital law]], that is, an electric current will produce a mmf.\n\nA winding of N turns is modeled by a gyrator with a gyration resistance of N ohms.<ref name=\"Hamill\"/>{{rp|100}}\n\nTransducers that are not based on magnetic induction may not be represented by a gyrator.

The transformer in this example has three primary windings and three secondary windings.  The magnetic circuit is split into seven reluctance or permeance elements.  Each winding is modeled by a gyrator.  The gyration resistance of each gyrator is equal to the number of turns on the associated winding.  Each permeance element is modeled by a capacitor.

On a complex plane, the magnetic reactance appears as the side of the resistance triangle for circuit of an alternating current.\n\n== Limitations of the analogy ==\nThe limitations of this analogy between magnetic circuits and electric circuits include the following;\n\n* Electric currents represent the flow of particles (electrons) and carry [[Power (physics)|power]], part  or all of which is dissipated as heat in resistances.  The \"magnetic current\" in this analogy is better thought of as a displacement current of magnetic dipoles.<ref name=\"Gonz\u00e1lez\" />\n* The current in typical electric circuits is confined to the circuit, with very little \"leakage\".  In typical magnetic circuits not all of the magnetic field is confined to the magnetic circuit because magnetic permeability also exists outside materials (see [[vacuum permeability]]). Thus, there may be significant \"[[leakage flux]]\" in the space outside the magnetic cores. If the leakage flux is small compared to the main circuit, it can often be represented as additional elements. In extreme cases, a lumped-element model may not be appropriate at all, and [[Field theory (physics)|field theory]] is used instead.\n* Magnetic circuits are [[Nonlinear element|nonlinear]]; the reluctance in a magnetic circuit is not constant, as resistance is, but varies depending on the magnetic field.  At high magnetic fluxes the [[ferromagnetic materials]] used for the cores of magnetic circuits [[Saturation (magnetic)|saturate]], limiting further increase of the magnetic flux, so above this level the reluctance increases rapidly.  In addition, ferromagnetic materials suffer from [[hysteresis]] so the flux in them depends not just on the instantaneous MMF but also on the history of MMF.  After the source of the magnetic flux is turned off, [[remanent magnetism]] is left in ferromagnetic materials, creating flux with no MMF.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|group=lower-alpha}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Gyrator-capacitor model}}\n[[Category:Electronic engineering]]\n[[Category:Electrical analogies]]\n[[Category:Magnetic circuits]]\n", "text_old": "{{About|modeling the magnetic field in magnetic components such as transformers and chokes|the circuit element|Gyrator}}\n{{MagneticCircuitSegments}}\n[[File:Gyrator-Capacitor model of a simple transformer.png|thumb|upright=1.5|A simple transformer and its gyrator-capacitor model.

The gyrator is the complement of the [[transformer]]; whereas in a transformer, a voltage on one port will transform to a proportional voltage on the other port, in a gyrator, a voltage on one port will transform to a current on the other port, and vice versa.\n\nThe role gyrators play in the gyrator\u2013capacitor model is as [[transducer]]s between the electrical energy domain and the magnetic energy domain.  An emf in the electrical domain is analogous to an mmf in the magnetic domain, and a transducer doing such a conversion would be represented as a transformer.  However, real electro-magnetic transducers usually behave as gyrators.  A transducer from the magnetic domain to the electrical domain will obey [[Faraday's law of induction]], that is, a rate of change of magnetic flux (a magnetic current in this analogy) produces a proportional emf in the electrical domain.  Similarly, a transducer from the electrical domain to the magnetic domain will obey [[Amp\u00e8re's circuital law]], that is, an electric current will produce a mmf.\n\nA winding of N turns is modeled by a gyrator with a gyration resistance of N ohms.<ref name=\"Hamill\"/>{{rp|100}}\n\nTransducers that are not based on magnetic induction may not be represented by a gyrator.

In the SI system, it is measured in units of -[[ohm|\u03a9]]<sup>\u22121</sup>.  This model makes [[magnetomotive force]] (mmf) the analog of [[electromotive force]] in electrical circuits, and time rate of change of magnetic flux the analog of electric current.\n\nFor phasor analysis the magnetic inductive reactance is:\n\n:<math>x_\\mathrm{L} = \\omega L_\\mathrm{M}</math>\n\nWhere:\n\n:<math>L_\\mathrm{M}</math> is the magnetic inductivity ([[SI unit]]: s\u00b7[[ohm|\u03a9]]<sup>\u22121</sup>)\n:<math>\\omega</math> is the [[angular frequency]] of the magnetic circuit\n\nIn the complex form it is a positive imaginary number:\n\n:<math>jx_\\mathrm{L} = j\\omega L_\\mathrm{M}</math>\n\nThe magnetic potential energy sustained by magnetic inductivity varies with the frequency of oscillations in electric fields.

Due to its dependence on frequency, magnetic inductance is mainly observable in magnetic circuits which operate at [[Very high frequency|VHF]] and/or [[Ultra high frequency|UHF]] frequencies.{{cn|date=April 2020|reason=reference Mohammad says magnetic inductance will not considered a magnetic element on page 43}}\n\nThe notion of magnetic inductivity is employed in analysis and computation of circuit behavior in the  gyrator\u2013capacitor model in a way analogous to [[inductance]] in electrical circuits.\n\nA magnetic inductor can represent an electrical capacitor<ref name=\"Mohammad\"/>{{rp|43}}.

The transformer in this example has three primary windings and three secondary windings.  The magnetic circuit is split into seven reluctance or permeance elements.  Each winding is modeled by a gyrator.  The gyration resistance of each gyrator is equal to the number of turns on the associated winding.  Each permeance element is modeled by a capacitor.  The value of each capacitor in [[farads]] is the same as the inductance of the associated permeance in [[Henry (unit)|henrys]].\n\nN<sub>1</sub>, N<sub>2</sub>, and N<sub>3</sub> are the number of turns in the three primary windings.

Gaps and leakage flux have a permeance which can be added to the equivalent circuit as capacitors.  The permeance of the gap is computed in the same way as the substantive elements, except a relative permeability of unity is used.  The permeance of the leakage flux may be difficult to compute due to complex geometry.

It is measured in units of <math>\\tfrac{1}{\\Omega}</math> and is denoted by <math>x</math> (or <math>X</math>). It may be inductive <math>x_L = \\omega L_M</math> or capacitive <math>x_C = \\tfrac{1}{\\omega C_M}</math>, where <math>\\omega</math> is the [[angular frequency]] of a magnetic current, <math>L_M</math> is the [[magnetic inductivity]] of a circuit, <math>C_M</math> is the magnetic capacitivity of a circuit.

On a complex plane, the magnetic reactance appears as the side of the resistance triangle for circuit of an alternating current.\n\n== Limitations of the analogy ==\nThe limitations of this analogy between magnetic circuits and electric circuits include the following;\n\n* Electric currents represent the flow of particles (electrons) and carry [[Power (physics)|power]], part  or all of which is dissipated as heat in resistances.  The \"magnetic current\" in this analogy is better thought of as a displacement current of magnetic dipoles.<ref name=\"Gonz\u00e1lez\" />\n* The current in typical electric circuits is confined to the circuit, with very little \"leakage\".  In typical magnetic circuits not all of the magnetic field is confined to the magnetic circuit because magnetic permeability also exists outside materials (see [[vacuum permeability]]). Thus, there may be significant \"[[leakage flux]]\" in the space outside the magnetic cores. If the leakage flux is small compared to the main circuit, it can often be represented as additional elements. In extreme cases, a lumped-element model may not be appropriate at all, and [[Field theory (physics)|field theory]] is used instead.\n* Magnetic circuits are [[Nonlinear element|nonlinear]]; the reluctance in a magnetic circuit is not constant, as resistance is, but varies depending on the magnetic field.  At high magnetic fluxes the [[ferromagnetic materials]] used for the cores of magnetic circuits [[Saturation (magnetic)|saturate]], limiting further increase of the magnetic flux, so above this level the reluctance increases rapidly.  In addition, ferromagnetic materials suffer from [[hysteresis]] so the flux in them depends not just on the instantaneous MMF but also on the history of MMF.  After the source of the magnetic flux is turned off, [[remanent magnetism]] is left in ferromagnetic materials, creating flux with no MMF.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|group=lower-alpha}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Gyrator-capacitor model}}\n[[Category:Electronic engineering]]\n[[Category:Electrical analogies]]\n[[Category:Magnetic circuits]]\n", "name_user": "Spinningspark", "label": "safe", "comment": "delinking, that's the third time it's linked", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gyrator%E2%80%93capacitor_model"}

It is patchily distributed in [[Queensland]], roughly southeast of a line between [[Mackay, Queensland|Mackay]] and [[Charleville, Queensland|Charleville]], being somewhat more common towards the extreme southeast of the state. In [[New South Wales]], it occurs throughout the [[New England Tablelands (biogeographic region)|New England Tablelands]] and the [[South West Slopes]], extending westward to the [[Pilliga Scrub]] and to [[Griffith, New South Wales|Griffith]] in the [[Riverina]], and eastwards into the [[Hunter Valley]]. It is fairly common in the [[Australian Capital Territory]]. In [[Victoria]], the speckled warbler is found within a broad strip, including the [[Chiltern Box-Ironbark National Park|Chiltern Box-Ironbark]] and [[Warby-Ovens National Park]]s, the [[Bendigo]] region, the [[Brisbane Ranges]] and [[You Yangs Regional Park|You Yangs]], across to Balmoral on the western side of the [[Grampians National Park|Grampians]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://ebird.org/map/spewar3|title=eBirdmap: Speckled warbler|accessdate=2020-04-22}}</ref> It is scarce to moderately common within its range.<ref name=Morcombe></ref> Its preferred habitat is open eucalypt woodland with rocky gullies, tussocky grass, scattered logs, and sparse shrubbery.<ref name=Morcombe></ref>\n\n==Behaviour==\nThe speckled warbler is quiet and well camouflaged. However, when disturbed, it will make a grating twitter and fly to a perch, then soon return to foraging on the ground.<ref name=Morcombe></ref> Its song is soft, mellow and musical, interspersed with sharp whistles, somewhat like that of the [[western gerygone]] (''Gerygone fusca'').<ref name=Pizzey></ref><ref name=Chapman>{{cite web|url=http://www.graemechapman.com.au/library/sounds.php?c=547&p=180|title=Chapman Library: Speckled warbler|accessdate=2020-04-22}}</ref> It is also a mimic of other species.<ref name=Pizzey></ref><ref name=Simpson></ref><ref name=Morcombe></ref><ref name=Gregory></ref> Like the [[redthroat]] (''Pyrrholaemus brunneus''), the speckled warbler makes a distinctive whirring sound with its wings in flight.<ref name=Chapman></ref>\n\n===Breeding===\nThe breeding season is from August to January.<ref name=Morcombe></ref> It builds a dome-shaped nest with a side-entrance in a slight hollow, near the base of a tree or dense shrub, or among fallen branches.<ref name=Pizzey></ref><ref name=Morcombe></ref> The nest is loosely built of dried grass, bark-shreds and moss, often lined with feathers and fur, and resembling the surrounding debris.<ref name=Morcombe></ref><ref name=Pizzey></ref> It lays a clutch of 3 or 4 eggs, each measuring {{convert|19|x|16|mm|in}}.<ref name=Morcombe></ref> The eggs are a reddish-chocolate colour, darker at the large end.<ref name=Pizzey></ref><ref name=Gregory></ref> The female incubates the eggs for 17-20 days,<ref name=Gregory></ref> and then broods the hatchlings.
