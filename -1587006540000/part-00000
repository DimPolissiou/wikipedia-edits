[[Georgetown, Guyana]].\n\n==History==\nIt was established in 1870 by the [[Anglican Communion|Anglican Church]] as a girls' school. It later merged with Mrs. Vyfhuis' school, also founded in 1870, and then with the DeSaffon school. Vyfhuis was offered [[Head teacher|headship]] of the combined schools in 1875. The school's first home was at Brickdam and Manget Place, and then at \"Minto House\" on Waterloo Street. It later moved to \"Lamaha House\" at Carmichael and Lamaha Streets, the property of Bishop E. A. Parry.\n\nIn 1907, Bishop E. A. Parry moved the school to \"Woodside House\" (now known as \"Transport House\") on Main Street, and it became known as \"Woodside House School\". In 1921 the school moved to its present location at Carmichael and Murray (now known as Quamina) streets. In 1922 Bishop E.A. Parry retired and the school then became known as \"The Bishops' High School\". Parry died in 1936 and the \"Oswald Parry Hall\" was opened at the school. \n\nIn January 1936, the school was handed over to the government of [[British Guiana]]. The new building was opened on January 5, 1946. The school celebrated its centennial in 1970 and became a co-educational institution in 1975.\n\nThe school's mottos are \"Secundo Percutientes Conscientiam Eorum Infirmam\" and \"Striving For Second\".\n\n==  Houses and their colours ==\nEach house is named after a former headmistress. \n* Allen House: golden yellow\n* Baskett House: pink\n* Dovindra Deodat House: blue\n* Vyfhuis House: mauve\n* Wearn House: red\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.bhstoronto.com Bishops' High School Alumni Association Toronto Chapter]\n*[http://www.bhsosa.org.gy/ Bishops' High School Old Students' Association]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20051123153107/http://www.bhsnytristate.org/ Bishops' High School Alumni Association New York Tri-State Chapter]\nThe above links are to three of the international chapters of the BHS alumni associations.

[[Georgetown, Guyana]].\n\n==History==\nIt was established in 1870 by the [[Anglican Communion|Anglican Church]] as a girls' school. It later merged with Mrs. Vyfhuis' school, also founded in 1870, and then with the DeSaffon school. Vyfhuis was offered [[Head teacher|headship]] of the combined schools in 1875. The school's first home was at Brickdam and Manget Place, and then at \"Minto House\" on Waterloo Street. It later moved to \"Lamaha House\" at Carmichael and Lamaha Streets, the property of Bishop E. A. Parry.\n\nIn 1907, Bishop E. A. Parry moved the school to \"Woodside House\" (now known as \"Transport House\") on Main Street, and it became known as \"Woodside House School\". In 1921 the school moved to its present location at Carmichael and Murray (now known as Quamina) streets. In 1922 Bishop E.A. Parry retired and the school then became known as \"The Bishops' High School\". Parry died in 1936 and the \"Oswald Parry Hall\" was opened at the school. \n\nIn January 1936, the school was handed over to the government of [[British Guiana]]. The new building was opened on January 5, 1946. The school celebrated its centennial in 1970 and became a co-educational institution in 1975.\n\nThe school's mottos are \"Labor Omnia Vincit\" and \"What so ever thy hand findeth to do,do it with thy might, for there is no worth nor device nor knowledge nor wisdom in the grave wither though goest\".\n\n==  Houses and their colours ==\nEach house is named after a former headmistress. \n* Allen House: golden yellow\n* Baskett House: pink\n* Dovindra Deodat House: blue\n* Vyfhuis House: mauve\n* Wearn House: red\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.bhstoronto.com Bishops' High School Alumni Association Toronto Chapter]\n*[http://www.bhsosa.org.gy/ Bishops' High School Old Students' Association]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20051123153107/http://www.bhsnytristate.org/ Bishops' High School Alumni Association New York Tri-State Chapter]\nThe above links are to three of the international chapters of the BHS alumni associations.
