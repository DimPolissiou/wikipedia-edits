In high school, he was involved in dramatic and oratorical contests, to the extent that when he graduated, he was named \"the best actor and the best orator in the state of Missouri.\"<ref>Rachel Fordyce, \"Aurand Harris: Playwright and Ambassador\", ''Spotlight on the Child: Studies in the History of American Children's Theatre'', p. 175. </ref>\n\n==Education==\nIn 1936 he obtained Bachelor of Arts from the University Kansas City.

It is the third polytechnic established in the country. As an industry-focused alternative to a broader based [[Junior college (Singapore)|junior college]]/ pre-university education, polytechnic graduates in Singapore are sought after for work or well-prepared to complete [[university]] degrees. In contrast to polytechnics in the United States and the UK, polytechnics in Singapore admit the majority of their students after [[secondary school]], normally at the age of 16-17(before receiving high school education), which is after ten years of formal education. A diploma in a specialised area of study, for example Law & Management, is awarded after completing three years of academic studies and industry internship.\n\nEstablished on April 6, 1990, the campus of the institute sits on a 30 hectare plot near the [[Bedok Reservoir]] in the eastern part of Singapore. Temasek Polytechnic features 37 full-time and > 40 part-time diploma courses, spread over 6 academic schools. Currently Temasek Polytechnic has approx. 14,000 full-time students and more than 1,200 academic and administrative staff.\n\n==History==\n\n===1989-1995===\nIn June 1989, [[Tony Tan (Singaporean president)|Dr Tony Tan]], then the Minister of Education, announced that a third polytechnic is being considered and in April, 1990, Temasek Polytechnic was established with an initial enrolment of 735 students. The institute originally set up at Baharuddin Vocational Institute's premises at Stirling Road and the vacated premises of Raffles Institution at Grange Road. Due to increased enrolment and the introduction of new courses, three more campuses at Kim Seng, Bukit Merah and Portsdown Road were acquired to house the institutes' student population.\n\n===1995: Moving to a permanent location===\nIn September, 1995, the permanent campus for Temasek Polytechnic was completed and it moved to its current location in the town of [[Tampines]].\n\n===2012-present: Logo redesign, construction of foyer===\nTemasek Polytechnic underwent a logo redesign, sporting a fresh new look to reflect the vibrancy of the school. The TP Auditorium Foyer began construction in 2010 and was completed in 2013. McDonald's, Subway, and Cheers are available to both staff and the general public.\n\n==Academic==\n===Academic Schools===\n*School of Applied Science\n*School of Business\n*School of Design\n*School of Engineering\n*School of Humanities & Social Sciences\n*School of Informatics & IT\n*Temasek Tourism Academy (TTA)\n\nTemasek Polytechnic offers 37 full-time diploma courses in the areas of applied sciences, business, design, engineering, humanities & social sciences, and informatics & IT.\n\n===Polytechnic Foundation Programme===\nThe Polytechnic Foundation Programme (PFP) was introduced in 2011 for students in the Normal Academic stream to be offered an opportunity to gain direct entry into Polytechnic diploma programmes with their 'N' level certifications starting from 2012 onwards. Top students of the cohort each year would be offered the programme to skip their 'O' level studies and instead enrol into a polytechnic of their choice to complete a foundation year before embarking on their respective diploma programmes. During the foundation year, students would take introductory modules that would expose them to their courses of studies so that they would cope better in their first year. There is no GPA requirement to advance to Year 1, as long as students pass all of their modules during Year 0. Although they would also be graded in Year 0, the GPA will not count towards their cumulative GPA when Year 1 commences.<ref>https://pfp.polytechnic.edu.sg/PFP/pfp_introduction.html</ref>\n\nThe Centre for Foundation Studies (CFS) in Temasek Polytechnic was established in 2011 for students admitted into their PFP studies (Year 0).<ref>https://www.tp.edu.sg/courses/full-time-courses/polytechnic-foundation-programme</ref>\n\n==Courses offered==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!School of Applied Science\n!School of Business\n!School of Design\n!School of Engineering\n!School of Humanities & Social Sciences\n!School of Informatics & IT\n!School of Temasek Tourism Academy\n|-\n| Chemical Engineering || Accountancy & Finance || Apparel Design & Merchandising || Aerospace Electronics || Early Childhood Development & Education || Big Data & Analytics || Hospitality & Tourism Management\n|-\n| Food, Nutrition & Culinary Science || Business Studies || Communication Design || Aerospace Engineering || Psychology Studies || Common ICT Programme || Leisure & Events Management\n|-\n| Medical Biotechnology || Common Business Programme || Digital Film & Television || Aviation Management || Social Sciences in Gerontology || Cybersecurity & Digital Forensics || \n|-\n| Pharmaceutical Science || Communications & Media Management || Interior Architecture & Design || Biomedical Engineering ||  || Financial Business Informatics || \n|-\n| Veterinary Technology || Law & Management || Product & Industrial Design || Business Process & Systems Engineering ||  || Game Design & Development || \n|-\n|  || Logistics & Operations Management ||  || Clean Energy ||  || Information Technology || \n|-\n|  || Marketing ||  || Common Engineering Programme ||  ||  || \n|-\n|  || Culinary & Catering Management ||  || Computer Engineering ||  ||  || \n|-\n|  ||  ||  || Electronics Engineering ||  ||  || \n|-\n|  ||  ||  || Green Building & Sustainability ||  ||  || \n|-\n|  ||  ||  || Integrated Facility Management ||  ||  || \n|-\n|  ||  ||  || Mechatronics ||  ||  || \n|}\n<ref>https://www.tp.edu.sg/courses/full-time-courses</ref>\n\n===The TP Student Profile and the TP Fundamentals Curriculum===\nIn 2017, TP adopted the TP Student Profile (TSP) that comprises nine desired attributes which together spell out how TP endeavours to develop each student into a Lifelong Learner, Future-oriented Creator and Values-Centred Leader. A set of subjects, collectively known as the TP Fundamentals (TPFun) curriculum was created concurrently to instil these TSP attributes in all our students and prepare them for the New Economy. TPFun focuses on imparting key skills including leadership, communication, critical thinking, innovation and entrepreneurship, which industries in this economy require. In addition, students will develop a more global mindset, build resilience through learning and playing a sport, and even gain knowledge and skills for healthy living.\n\n===Global Exposure===\nIn today's highly globalised economy, it is one of TP's main priorities to arm our graduates with the necessary skills to help them turn into world-savvy individuals. We are the only polytechnic in Singapore to have a Centre for TransCultural Studies, which works to create opportunities for our students to have cross-cultural experiences, both locally and overseas. Opportunities to acquire international experiences via learning trips, overseas internships and exchanges, as well as community involvement programmes are theirs for the taking.\n\n===Internships===\nInternships give our students real-world work experience, and is a cornerstone of the polytechnic teaching system. Generally ranging between 12 and 26 weeks, TP's internship programme exposes our students to the ins and outs of the very industry they will be a part of after they graduate. Our extensive industry networks give our students access to a wide range of businesses and academic institutions, both in Singapore and abroad. Some of them have enjoyed once-in-a-lifetime internship experiences working with world-renowned companies, such as Airbus in France, Disney World in the US and the Four Seasons Safari Lodge in Tanzania, while others have been involved with leading researchers at prestigious universities and research institutions around the world.\n\n===Advanced Standing===\nUniversities that recognise the TP diploma may grant advanced standing to you, depending on your academic achievements, sometimes for up to two years. This means that with a TP diploma, you spend a shorter time pursuing your degree at a university. Some of our students with a two-year advanced standing only need two years to complete a four-year honours degree course. Our graduates have done very well at local and overseas universities, with many getting good honours degrees in their fields. Many have also gone on to pursue their Masters and PhD programmes. More than half of our graduates go on to pursue a university degree immediately after graduation, or after National Service. Many more do so following some work experience.\n\n===SkillsFuture Earn and Learn Programmes===\nOur graduates can sign-up for Earn and Learn Programmes (ELP) \u2013 a work-study programme designed to give Singapore Citizens or PRs, who are fresh polytechnic or ITE graduates, a head-start in careers related to their discipline of studies. The ELP supports the participants\u2019 transition into the workforce by allowing them to secure full-time employment with industry leaders. It is also an opportunity for these graduates to build on the skills and knowledge within their respective specialisations after graduating from TP.\n\n==Campus Facilities==\n===Training Facilities===\nGetting trained at cutting-edge facilities, such as the TP-Nvidia Technology Centre, TP-Autodesk Serious Games Hub, Agilent Partner Laboratory @ TP, Interactive Digital Centre Asia and TP-Lufthansa Technical Training Centre Singapore, is an advantage students can look forward to when they join TP. Developed in partnership with various industry sectors, these facilities keep our students up-to-date with the most current operations platforms and the latest developments and practices.\n\n===State-of-the-art learning enterprises===\nIn addition to these facilities, our campus also has a range of Learning Enterprises that mimic actual business working environments. The TP-IBM IT Service Management Centre, the TP-Thomson Reuters Financial Risk Management Centre, TopTable (a fine-dining restaurant), Kelly Services Career Centre and the TP Animal Clinic, amongst others, provide our students with the opportunity to put to practice what they have learned through interacting with and servicing real customers.\n\n==Campus features==\n[[File:Temasek Polytechnic.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Main entrance of Temasek Polytechnic]]\nTemasek Polytechnic's campus was designed by architect [[James Stirling (architect)|James Stirling]]. The campus has 61 lecture theaters, a convention centre, canteens, auditoria, an amphitheatre, laboratories and training facilities, a large library, sporting facilities, and 13 food outlets including three caf\u00e9s, three F&B outlets and an air-conditioned food court.\n\nThe Temasek Aviation Academy was opened in 2014 in the School of Engineering . The 6000 square metre facility houses a [[Hawker 700]] private jet, specialised laboratories, and specialized training equipment for the aerospace diploma courses.<ref>https://www.tp.edu.sg/schools/bus/stop-press/news/more-new-buildings-on-campus</ref>\n\n==Former lecturer convicted of fraud==\nOn 30 May 2017, American Mikhy K. Farrera-Brochez was sentenced to 28 months jail for cheating, lying to a public servant, possessing drugs and using forged educational certificates to gain employment as a [[lecturer]] in early childhood and psychology for Temasek Polytechnic. Farrera-Brochez, who is [[HIV-positive]], moved to Singapore in 2008 and successfully applied for an employment pass in 2009 by faking his HIV blood test result with the aid from his boyfriend Ler Teck Siang who was on duty as a [[general practitioner]] at the clinic. Investigations further revealed his educational certificates, including a [[doctorate degree]] in [[psychology]] and education from the [[University of Paris]], were forged.<ref>http://www.asiaone.com/singapore/us-lecturer-jailed-28-months-spore-lying-about-hiv-status-qualifications</ref> In an interview with [[The New Paper]] in 2010, he claimed to be well-versed in Hebrew, English and Spanish and that he entered [[Princeton University]] at 13 before transferring to [[Vanderbilt University]] as the latter was better in [[linguistic]] courses.<ref>https://sg.news.yahoo.com/everything-must-know-low-life-103606966.html</ref> He also claimed that his mother, Teresa King, a renowned professor of child and adolescent psychology, child neurology and gifted science and mathematics education in the UK was responsible for his success. This claim was later proven to be false by UK mainstream media, [[The Independent]].<ref>{{cite news |title=HIV data leak: 'Mikhy Brochez' Facebook account removed for violating user policies |url=https://sg.news.yahoo.com/hiv-data-leak-mikhy-brochez-facebook-account-removed-violating-user-policies-141005120.html |work=sg.news.yahoo.com |date=14 February 2019 |language=en-SG}}</ref>\n\nOn 28 January 2019, after being deported back to the United States, Farrera-Brochez released confidential information of 14,200 individuals diagnosed with the [[human immunodeficiency virus]] in Singapore that he had obtained from Ler when he was the head of the National Public Health Unit in the [[Ministry of Health]].<ref>http://redwiretimes.com/singapore-in-brief/health-ministry-records-of-14200-hiv-patients-illegally-obtained-in-2016-leaked-online/</ref><ref>https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-47027867\n</ref>\n\n==Achievements==\n* In 2018, students designed and built a [[Proton Exchange Membrane]]-power unit, successfully powering both an [[UAV]] and an electric bicycle using the same unit, thought to be a world-first.<ref>http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/transport/polys-fuel-cell-bet-pays-off</ref>\n* The School of Design is a three-time winner of the Crowbar Awards 'Institution of the Year' and 'Best of Show' for the year 2017, 2018 and most recently 2019.

It is the third polytechnic established in the country. As an industry-focused alternative to a broader based [[Junior college (Singapore)|junior college]]/ pre-university education, polytechnic graduates in Singapore are sought after for work or well-prepared to complete [[university]] degrees. In contrast to polytechnics in the United States and the UK, polytechnics in Singapore admit the majority of their students after [[secondary school]], normally at the age of 16-17(before receiving high school education), which is after ten years of formal education. A diploma in a specialised area of study, for example Law & Management, is awarded after completing three years of academic studies and industry internship.\n\nEstablished on April 6, 1990, the campus of the institute sits on a 30 hectare plot near the [[Bedok Reservoir]] in the eastern part of Singapore. Temasek Polytechnic features 37 full-time and > 40 part-time diploma courses, spread over 6 academic schools. Currently Temasek Polytechnic has approx. 14,000 full-time students and more than 1,200 academic and administrative staff.\n\n==History==\n\n===1989-1995===\nIn June 1989, [[Tony Tan (Singaporean president)|Dr Tony Tan]], then the Minister of Education, announced that a third polytechnic is being considered and in April, 1990, Temasek Polytechnic was established with an initial enrolment of 735 students. The institute originally set up at Baharuddin Vocational Institute's premises at Stirling Road and the vacated premises of Raffles Institution at Grange Road. Due to increased enrolment and the introduction of new courses, three more campuses at Kim Seng, Bukit Merah and Portsdown Road were acquired to house the institutes' student population.\n\n===1995: Moving to a permanent location===\nIn September, 1995, the permanent campus for Temasek Polytechnic was completed and it moved to its current location in the town of [[Tampines]].\n\n===2012-present: Logo redesign, construction of foyer===\nTemasek Polytechnic underwent a logo redesign, sporting a fresh new look to reflect the vibrancy of the school. The TP Auditorium Foyer began construction in 2010 and was completed in 2013. McDonald's, Subway, and Cheers are available to both staff and the general public.\n\n==Academic==\n===Academic Schools===\n*School of Applied Science\n*School of Business\n*School of Design\n*School of Engineering\n*School of Humanities & Social Sciences\n*School of Informatics & IT\n*Temasek Tourism Academy (TTA)\n\nTemasek Polytechnic offers 37 full-time diploma courses in the areas of applied sciences, business, design, engineering, humanities & social sciences, and informatics & IT.\n\n===Polytechnic Foundation Programme===\nThe Polytechnic Foundation Programme (PFP) was introduced in 2011 for students in the Normal Academic stream to be offered an opportunity to gain direct entry into Polytechnic diploma programmes with their 'N' level certifications starting from 2012 onwards. Top students of the cohort each year would be offered the programme to skip their 'O' level studies and instead enrol into a polytechnic of their choice to complete a foundation year before embarking on their respective diploma programmes. During the foundation year, students would take introductory modules that would expose them to their courses of studies so that they would cope better in their first year. There is no GPA requirement to advance to Year 1, as long as students pass all of their modules during Year 0. Although they would also be graded in Year 0, the GPA will not count towards their cumulative GPA when Year 1 commences.\n\nThe Centre for Foundation Studies (CFS) in Temasek Polytechnic was established in 2011 for students admitted into their PFP studies (Year 0).<ref>https://www.tp.edu.sg/courses/full-time-courses/polytechnic-foundation-programme</ref>\n\n==Courses offered==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!School of Applied Science\n!School of Business\n!School of Design\n!School of Engineering\n!School of Humanities & Social Sciences\n!School of Informatics & IT\n!School of Temasek Tourism Academy\n|-\n| Chemical Engineering || Accountancy & Finance || Apparel Design & Merchandising || Aerospace Electronics || Early Childhood Development & Education || Big Data & Analytics || Hospitality & Tourism Management\n|-\n| Food, Nutrition & Culinary Science || Business Studies || Communication Design || Aerospace Engineering || Psychology Studies || Common ICT Programme || Leisure & Events Management\n|-\n| Medical Biotechnology || Common Business Programme || Digital Film & Television || Aviation Management || Social Sciences in Gerontology || Cybersecurity & Digital Forensics || \n|-\n| Pharmaceutical Science || Communications & Media Management || Interior Architecture & Design || Biomedical Engineering ||  || Financial Business Informatics || \n|-\n| Veterinary Technology || Law & Management || Product & Industrial Design || Business Process & Systems Engineering ||  || Game Design & Development || \n|-\n|  || Logistics & Operations Management ||  || Clean Energy ||  || Information Technology || \n|-\n|  || Marketing ||  || Common Engineering Programme ||  ||  || \n|-\n|  || Culinary & Catering Management ||  || Computer Engineering ||  ||  || \n|-\n|  ||  ||  || Electronics Engineering ||  ||  || \n|-\n|  ||  ||  || Green Building & Sustainability ||  ||  || \n|-\n|  ||  ||  || Integrated Facility Management ||  ||  || \n|-\n|  ||  ||  || Mechatronics ||  ||  || \n|}\n<ref>https://www.tp.edu.sg/courses/full-time-courses</ref>\n\n===The TP Student Profile and the TP Fundamentals Curriculum===\nIn 2017, TP adopted the TP Student Profile (TSP) that comprises nine desired attributes which together spell out how TP endeavours to develop each student into a Lifelong Learner, Future-oriented Creator and Values-Centred Leader. A set of subjects, collectively known as the TP Fundamentals (TPFun) curriculum was created concurrently to instil these TSP attributes in all our students and prepare them for the New Economy. TPFun focuses on imparting key skills including leadership, communication, critical thinking, innovation and entrepreneurship, which industries in this economy require. In addition, students will develop a more global mindset, build resilience through learning and playing a sport, and even gain knowledge and skills for healthy living.\n\n===Global Exposure===\nIn today's highly globalised economy, it is one of TP's main priorities to arm our graduates with the necessary skills to help them turn into world-savvy individuals. We are the only polytechnic in Singapore to have a Centre for TransCultural Studies, which works to create opportunities for our students to have cross-cultural experiences, both locally and overseas. Opportunities to acquire international experiences via learning trips, overseas internships and exchanges, as well as community involvement programmes are theirs for the taking.\n\n===Internships===\nInternships give our students real-world work experience, and is a cornerstone of the polytechnic teaching system. Generally ranging between 12 and 26 weeks, TP's internship programme exposes our students to the ins and outs of the very industry they will be a part of after they graduate. Our extensive industry networks give our students access to a wide range of businesses and academic institutions, both in Singapore and abroad. Some of them have enjoyed once-in-a-lifetime internship experiences working with world-renowned companies, such as Airbus in France, Disney World in the US and the Four Seasons Safari Lodge in Tanzania, while others have been involved with leading researchers at prestigious universities and research institutions around the world.\n\n===Advanced Standing===\nUniversities that recognise the TP diploma may grant advanced standing to you, depending on your academic achievements, sometimes for up to two years. This means that with a TP diploma, you spend a shorter time pursuing your degree at a university. Some of our students with a two-year advanced standing only need two years to complete a four-year honours degree course. Our graduates have done very well at local and overseas universities, with many getting good honours degrees in their fields. Many have also gone on to pursue their Masters and PhD programmes. More than half of our graduates go on to pursue a university degree immediately after graduation, or after National Service. Many more do so following some work experience.\n\n===SkillsFuture Earn and Learn Programmes===\nOur graduates can sign-up for Earn and Learn Programmes (ELP) \u2013 a work-study programme designed to give Singapore Citizens or PRs, who are fresh polytechnic or ITE graduates, a head-start in careers related to their discipline of studies. The ELP supports the participants\u2019 transition into the workforce by allowing them to secure full-time employment with industry leaders. It is also an opportunity for these graduates to build on the skills and knowledge within their respective specialisations after graduating from TP.\n\n==Campus Facilities==\n===Training Facilities===\nGetting trained at cutting-edge facilities, such as the TP-Nvidia Technology Centre, TP-Autodesk Serious Games Hub, Agilent Partner Laboratory @ TP, Interactive Digital Centre Asia and TP-Lufthansa Technical Training Centre Singapore, is an advantage students can look forward to when they join TP. Developed in partnership with various industry sectors, these facilities keep our students up-to-date with the most current operations platforms and the latest developments and practices.\n\n===State-of-the-art learning enterprises===\nIn addition to these facilities, our campus also has a range of Learning Enterprises that mimic actual business working environments. The TP-IBM IT Service Management Centre, the TP-Thomson Reuters Financial Risk Management Centre, TopTable (a fine-dining restaurant), Kelly Services Career Centre and the TP Animal Clinic, amongst others, provide our students with the opportunity to put to practice what they have learned through interacting with and servicing real customers.\n\n==Campus features==\n[[File:Temasek Polytechnic.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Main entrance of Temasek Polytechnic]]\nTemasek Polytechnic's campus was designed by architect [[James Stirling (architect)|James Stirling]]. The campus has 61 lecture theaters, a convention centre, canteens, auditoria, an amphitheatre, laboratories and training facilities, a large library, sporting facilities, and 13 food outlets including three caf\u00e9s, three F&B outlets and an air-conditioned food court.\n\nThe Temasek Aviation Academy was opened in 2014 in the School of Engineering . The 6000 square metre facility houses a [[Hawker 700]] private jet, specialised laboratories, and specialized training equipment for the aerospace diploma courses.<ref>https://www.tp.edu.sg/schools/bus/stop-press/news/more-new-buildings-on-campus</ref>\n\n==Former lecturer convicted of fraud==\nOn 30 May 2017, American Mikhy K. Farrera-Brochez was sentenced to 28 months jail for cheating, lying to a public servant, possessing drugs and using forged educational certificates to gain employment as a [[lecturer]] in early childhood and psychology for Temasek Polytechnic. Farrera-Brochez, who is [[HIV-positive]], moved to Singapore in 2008 and successfully applied for an employment pass in 2009 by faking his HIV blood test result with the aid from his boyfriend Ler Teck Siang who was on duty as a [[general practitioner]] at the clinic. Investigations further revealed his educational certificates, including a [[doctorate degree]] in [[psychology]] and education from the [[University of Paris]], were forged.<ref>http://www.asiaone.com/singapore/us-lecturer-jailed-28-months-spore-lying-about-hiv-status-qualifications</ref> In an interview with [[The New Paper]] in 2010, he claimed to be well-versed in Hebrew, English and Spanish and that he entered [[Princeton University]] at 13 before transferring to [[Vanderbilt University]] as the latter was better in [[linguistic]] courses.<ref>https://sg.news.yahoo.com/everything-must-know-low-life-103606966.html</ref> He also claimed that his mother, Teresa King, a renowned professor of child and adolescent psychology, child neurology and gifted science and mathematics education in the UK was responsible for his success.

In 1952, Farina visited the U.S. for the unveiling of his design for the [[Nash Ambassador]] and [[Nash Statesman|Statesman]] lines, which, although they did carry some details of Pinin Farina's design, were largely designed by Nash's then-new in-house styling staff when the original Farina-designed model proved unsuited to American tastes, exhibiting a popular 1950s appearance called \"[[Ponton (automobile)|ponton]]\". The [[Nash-Healey]] sports car [[car body style|body]] was, however, completely designed and assembled in limited numbers from 1952 to 1954 at Pinin Farina's Turin facilities. Nash heavily advertised its link to the famous Italian designer, much as [[Studebaker]] promoted its longtime association with [[Raymond Loewy]]. As a result of Nash's million advertising campaign, Pinin Farina became well known in the U.S.<ref name=\"Borgeson-1963-12\"/>\n\nPinin Farina also built the bodies for the limited-series [[Cadillac Eldorado Brougham]] for General Motors in 1959 and 1960, assembled them and sent them back to the U.S. There were 99 Broughams built in 1959 and 101 in 1960. A similar arrangement was repeated in the late 1980s when Pininfarina designed (and partially assembled) the [[Cadillac Allant\u00e9]] at the [[San Giusto Canavese]] factory. The car bodies were assembled and painted in Italy before being flown from the [[Turin International Airport]] to Detroit for final vehicle assembly.\n\n=== The Ferrari partnership ===\nIt started in 1951 with a meeting at a restaurant in [[Tortona]], a small town halfway between Turin and Modena. This neutral territory was chosen because neither Farina nor [[Enzo Ferrari]] wanted to meet at the other's headquarters. Pinin\u2019s son, [[Sergio Pininfarina]] recalled, \"It is not difficult to imagine how I felt that afternoon when my father, without taking his eyes off the road for one moment told me his decision as we drove back to Turin: \"From now on you'll be looking after Ferrari, from A to Z.

The Alfa was the first vehicle that Pinin Farina produced in large numbers, in fact Alfa Romeo chose Pinin Farina to produce the Spider in large part because they felt confident that they could produce 20 cars a day for a run of 1,000 bodies. The Spider was a huge success for Alfa Romeo and Pinin Farina. [[Max Hoffman]] the importer for the United States said he could sell as many as they could make. In 1956, the first year of production, they produced 1025 units which then expanded to over 4,000 in 1959 the first full year of the new Grugliasco factory.<ref>{{citation | last = Wilson | first = Evan | title = Alfa Romeo Giulietta: 750 and 101 series Giuliettas and Giulias, 1954-1965 | page = 43 | date = 1983 | isbn = 978-0850454963 | publisher = Osprey Publishing }}</ref>\n\n=== The second generation of leadership ===\nStarting with the planning for the new plant in Grugliasco in 1956, Pinin started to groom his replacements\u2013Sergio his son and Renzo Carli his son-in-law.

Most prototypes\u2014such as the [[Ferrari Mythos]], were [[concept car]]s, although several have become production models, including the [[Ferrari 612 Scaglietti]] and [[Ferrari F50]].\n\nA recent privately commissioned custom example was the [[Ferrari P4/5 by Pininfarina|Ferrari P4/5]] of 2006, a one-car rebody (changing the exterior design) of the [[Enzo Ferrari (automobile)|Enzo Ferrari]] according to the client's specifications. Its design began in September 2005 with sketches by [[Jason Castriota]] moving through computer aided sculpture and stringent [[wind tunnel]] testing. More than 200 components were designed especially for the car though the engine, drivetrain and many other components are simply modified from the original Enzo Ferrari. The [[Vehicle Identification Number]] (VIN) is unchanged from the Enzo it was derived from. The P4/5 was publicly revealed on 18 August 2006 at the [[Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance]] and shown again at the [[Paris Motor Show]] in late September. Another recent prototype is the [[Pininfarina Nido]], a two-seater sub-compact that could possibly make airbags obsolete.\n\nThe [[Pininfarina B0]] solar-electric concept, designed with [[Bollor\u00e9]] was shown at the 2008 Paris Motor Show featuring a range between charges of more than {{convert|150|mi|0|}} with an electronically limited {{convert|88|mph|0|adj=on}} top speed, and an estimated acceleration to {{convert|37|mph|0|}} in 6.3 seconds.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.edmunds.com/insideline/autoshows/paris/2008/pininfarinabo.html |last=Lienert |first=Paul |title=2008 Paris Auto Show: Pininfarina B0 |publisher=Edmunds Inside Line |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090728214832/http://www.edmunds.com/insideline/autoshows/paris/2008/pininfarinabo.html |archivedate=28 July 2009 |accessdate=19 June 2014}}</ref> The car has solar panels on the roof and on the nose, while its battery pack is said to last up to {{convert|125000|mi|0|}}.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.india.com/technology/cars/the_pininfarina_bo_electric_car |publisher=India. com. |title=The Pininfarina BO Electric Car |date=6 October 2008 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090129195430/http://www.india.com/technology/cars/the_pininfarina_bo_electric_car |archivedate=29 January 2009 |accessdate=19 June 2014}}</ref>\n\nOn 15 May 2013 Pininfarina announced the BMW Pininfarina Gran Lusso Coup\u00e9 to be revealed on 24 May at the Concorso d\u2019Eleganza Villa d\u2019Este.

In 1952, Farina visited the U.S. for the unveiling of his design for the [[Nash Ambassador]] and [[Nash Statesman|Statesman]] lines, which, although they did carry some details of Pinin Farina's design, were largely designed by Nash's then-new in-house styling staff when the original Farina-designed model proved unsuited to American tastes, exhibiting a popular 1950s appearance called \"[[Ponton (automobile)|ponton]]\". The [[Nash-Healey]] sports car [[car body style|body]] was, however, completely designed and assembled in limited numbers from 1952 to 1954 at Pinin Farina's Turin facilities. Nash heavily advertised its link to the famous Italian designer, much as [[Studebaker]] promoted its longtime association with [[Raymond Loewy]]. As a result of Nash's million advertising campaign, Pinin Farina became well known in the U.S.<ref name=\"Borgeson-1963-12\"/>\n\nPinin Farina also built the bodies for the limited-series [[Cadillac Eldorado Brougham]] for General Motors in 1959 and 1960, assembled them and sent them back to the U.S. There were 99 Broughams built in 1959 and 101 in 1960. A similar arrangement was repeated in the late 1980s when Pininfarina designed (and partially assembled) the [[Cadillac Allant\u00e9]] at the [[San Giusto Canavese]] factory. The car bodies were assembled and painted in Italy before being flown from the [[Turin International Airport]] to Detroit for final vehicle assembly.\n\n=== The Ferrari partnership ===\nIt started in 1951 with a meeting at a restaurant in [[Tortona]], a small town halfway between Turin and Modena. This neutral territory was chosen because neither Farina nor [[Enzo Ferrari]] wanted to meet at the other's headquarters. Pinin\u2019s son, [[Sergio Pininfarina]] recalled, \"It is not difficult to imagine how I felt that afternoon when my father, without taking his eyes off the road for one moment told me his decision as we drove back to Turin: \"From now on you'll be looking after Ferrari, from A to Z.

The Alfa was the first vehicle that Pinin Farina produced in large numbers, in fact Alfa Romeo chose Pinin Farina to produce the Spider in large part because they felt confident that they could produce 20 cars a day for a run of 1,000 bodies. The Spider was a huge success for Alfa Romeo and Pinin Farina. [[Max Hoffman]] the importer for the United States said he could sell as many as they could make. In 1956, the first year of production, they produced 1025 units which then expanded to over 4,000 in 1959 the first full year of the new Grugliasco factory.<ref>{{citation | last = Wilson | first = Evan | title = Alfa Romeo Giulietta: 750 and 101 series Giuliettas and Giulias, 1954-1965 | page = 43 | date = 1983 | isbn = 978-0850454963 | publisher = Osprey Publishing }}</ref>\n\n=== The second generation of leadership ===\nStarting with the planning for the new plant in Grugliasco in 1956, Pinin started to groom his replacements\u2013Sergio his son and Renzo Carli his son-in-law.

On 14 October 2002, Pininfarina inaugurated a new engineering centre. The new facility, which was built at the Cambiano campus, to give greater visibility and independence to the engineering operations.\n\nIn 1983, Pininfarina reached an agreement with [[General Motors]] to design and build the [[Cadillac Allant\u00e9]].

Most prototypes\u2014such as the [[Ferrari Mythos]], were [[concept car]]s, although several have become production models, including the [[Ferrari 612 Scaglietti]] and [[Ferrari F50]].\n\nA recent privately commissioned custom example was the [[Ferrari P4/5 by Pininfarina|Ferrari P4/5]] of 2006, a one-car rebody (changing the exterior design) of the [[Enzo Ferrari (automobile)|Enzo Ferrari]] according to the client's specifications. Its design began in September 2005 with sketches by [[Jason Castriota]] moving through computer aided sculpture and stringent [[wind tunnel]] testing. More than 200 components were designed especially for the car though the engine, drivetrain and many other components are simply modified from the original Enzo Ferrari. The [[Vehicle Identification Number]] (VIN) is unchanged from the Enzo it was derived from. The P4/5 was publicly revealed on 18 August 2006 at the [[Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance]] and shown again at the [[Paris Motor Show]] in late September. Another recent prototype is the [[Pininfarina Nido]], a two-seater sub-compact that could possibly make airbags obsolete.\n\nThe [[Pininfarina B0]] solar-electric concept, designed with [[Bollor\u00e9]] was shown at the 2008 Paris Motor Show featuring a range between charges of more than {{convert|150|mi|0|}} with an electronically limited {{convert|88|mph|0|adj=on}} top speed, and an estimated acceleration to {{convert|37|mph|0|}} in 6.3 seconds.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.edmunds.com/insideline/autoshows/paris/2008/pininfarinabo.html |last=Lienert |first=Paul |title=2008 Paris Auto Show: Pininfarina B0 |publisher=Edmunds Inside Line |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090728214832/http://www.edmunds.com/insideline/autoshows/paris/2008/pininfarinabo.html |archivedate=28 July 2009 |accessdate=19 June 2014}}</ref> The car has solar panels on the roof and on the nose, while its battery pack is said to last up to {{convert|125000|mi|0|}}.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.india.com/technology/cars/the_pininfarina_bo_electric_car |publisher=India. com. |title=The Pininfarina BO Electric Car |date=6 October 2008 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090129195430/http://www.india.com/technology/cars/the_pininfarina_bo_electric_car |archivedate=29 January 2009 |accessdate=19 June 2014}}</ref>\n\nOn 15 May 2013 Pininfarina announced the BMW Pininfarina Gran Lusso Coup\u00e9 to be revealed on 24 May at the Concorso d\u2019Eleganza Villa d\u2019Este.

The team is a member of the summer collegiate [[Prospect League]].\n\n==Team history==\nThe Paints played in the [[Independent baseball|independent]] [[Frontier League]] from the 1993 season until the end of the 2008 season. They were one of the original teams in the league. The Paints play their home games at [[V.A. Memorial Stadium]].\n\nThe Paints were the longest tenured franchise in the Frontier League to date. They reached the Frontier League Championship Series on six occasions (1996, 1998, 1999, 2001, 2005, 2006). However, they never were able to claim a Frontier League championship win.\n\nIn 2005, the Paints set a team record by drawing over 8,500 fans.\n\n[[V.A. Memorial Stadium]] had grass from 1993\u20132005. The ballpark installed FieldTurf in 2006, the first baseball field in the United States to have a 100% FieldTurf playing surface, including base, mound and home plate areas.\n\nFollowing the 2008 season, the ownership announced that they would leave the Frontier League,  becoming an amateur [[List of collegiate summer baseball leagues|collegiate summer baseball]] team. Since 2009, they have competed in the [[Prospect League]], an amateur collegiate summer league.\n\nIn 2010, the Paints won their first Prospect League championship against the [[Danville Dans]] on an 11th inning [[walk off home run]] by Ian Nelson.\n\nTwo years later they made another playoff appearance, and lost in the first round to the [[West Virginia Miners]], 6\u20132.\n\nThe Paints celebrated their 25th season in 2017. As part of the festivities, the Paints retired longtime coach Marty Dunn's number 25 in a pregame ceremony that included former players and staff throughout the first 24 seasons of Paints baseball. That season, the Paints averaged 1,959 fans per game, setting a franchise record in both average attendance and total attendance. The 58,755 total attendance marked a new Prospect League record. The Paints ranked in the top 10 of all summer collegiate teams nationwide in per-game attendance in 2017.\n\nAfter missing the playoffs in 2016 and 2017, Chillicothe made a return to the playoffs in 2018, losing to the [[Kokomo Jackrabbits]] two games to one in the East Division Championship Series. It was the first playoff appearance for manager Brian Bigam since he took over the reins in 2016. Jack Raines was named the Prospect League's Galen Woods Fireman of the Year (Reliever of the Year)\n\nThe Paints began the 2019 season 2\u20137, but went 41-14 the rest of the campaign (including 3\u20131 in the playoffs) and defeated the Danville Dans in a one-game East Division Championship Game and then, after losing game one of the Prospect League Championship Series at home to the league's newest team, the Cape Catfish, the Paints won games two and three in Cape Girardeau, Mo., to capture the franchise's second league title. Trailing 2\u20131 in the middle of the game, Trey Smith hit a grand slam to put Chillicothe in the lead 5\u20132, the eventual final score. Closer Nate Haugh was named the Prospect League's Galen Woods Fireman of the Year (Reliever of the Year). For the first time in team history, the Paints averaged at least 2,000 fans per game (2,037) and totaled 57,040 for the season, leading the league and ranking 15th nationally in both categories among similar type teams nationwide.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ballparkdigest.com/2019/08/12/2019-summer-collegiate-attendance-by-average/|title=2019 Summer Collegiate Attendance by Average|last=Reichard|first=Kevin|date=2019-08-12|website=Ballpark Digest|language=en-US|access-date=2019-11-04}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ballparkdigest.com/2019/08/12/2019-summer-collegiate-attendance-by-total/|title=2019 Summer Collegiate Attendance by Total|last=Reichard|first=Kevin|date=2019-08-12|website=Ballpark Digest|language=en-US|access-date=2019-11-04}}</ref>\n\n== Retired Numbers ==\n\n*20 - OF  Gator McBride (All-Star and hit leader)\n*22 - P  Brian Tollberg (first Frontier League player to make it to the MLB with the San Diego Padres)\n*24 - SS Travis O.

Dunn has served as an interim coach for a few games since Hanners's retirement. During the Wilson era, pitching coaches Jim Frisbee (2005) and Johnny Ruffin (2006) have filled in during an absence, although Dunn has been on staff. During a road trip to [[Traverse City, Michigan]] in 2006, former Cy Young award winner [[Doug Drabek]] served as manager while Wilson was tending to things at his Texas home.\n\nIn late 2006, Wilson saw his contract not renewed, due to many reasons. That same day, the Paints organization named longtime [[Washington Wild Things]] assistant Mark Mason their new manager. Mason also managed the [[Ohio Valley Redcoats]], in 2005 winning the Roger Hanners Manager of the Year award.\n\nAfter 2008, Mark Mason was named the fourth manager of the Washington Wildthings replacing Greg Jelks. Mason will not be returning to the Paints in the Prospect league.\n\nThe Paints began play in the college wood-bat Prospect League in 2009 with former player Brian Mannino as manager. He was at the helm for the Paints first league championship win in franchise history in 2010 and managed through the 2011 season. Mannino continues to serve as Director of Baseball Operations, finding players and signing them each season.\n\nUniversity of Missouri Hall of Famer and former longtime Ohio State assistant Greg Cypret took over managing duties in 2012 and collected the second-most wins of any manager in Paints' history, behind only Roger Hanners. A stroke following the 2015 season forced Cypret to step away from managing, though he returned to the staff as an assistant coach beginning in 2017.\n\nCircleville native Brian Bigam took over managing duties in 2016 after guiding some of the best pitching staffs in the Prospect League as Chillicothe's Pitching Coach throughout several seasons. Bigam is currently the Paints' manager and helped the Paints to their 8th playoff appearance in 11 years of Prospect League play in 2019. The Paints led the Prospect League with the lowest ERA, fewest walks, and in several other categories in 2018. Bigam helped to guide the Paints to their second league championship in 2019. Again, the Paints boasted one of the best pitching staffs in the league, including the Reliever of the Year for the second-straight season.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+List of Managers\n!Name\n!Seasons\n!Regular Season Record\n!Post-season Record\n!Playoff App.\n!Divisional Titles\n!League Titles\n|-\n|Mark Jones\n|1\n|14&ndash;15 (.483)\n|0&ndash;0\n|0\n|0\n|0\n|-\n|Roger Hanners\n|8\n|289&ndash;267 (.520)\n|8&ndash;10 (.444)\n|4\n|4\n|0\n|-\n|Jamie Keefe\n|4\n|142&ndash;161 (.468)\n|3&ndash;6 (.333)\n|2\n|2\n|0\n|-\n|Glenn Wilson\n|2\n|111&ndash;79 (.584)\n|8&ndash;9 (.471)\n|2\n|2\n|0\n|-\n|Mark Mason\n|2\n|86&ndash;106 (.448)\n|0&ndash;0\n|0\n|0\n|0\n|-\n|Brian Mannino\n|3\n|98&ndash;72 (.576)\n|2&ndash;2 (.500)\n|2\n|2\n|1\n|-\n|Greg Cypret\n|4\n|152&ndash;98 (.608)\n|3&ndash;7 (.300)\n|4\n|2\n|0\n|-\n|Brian Bigam\n|4\n|129&ndash;115 (.529)\n|4&ndash;3 (.571)\n|2\n|1\n|1\n|-\n|'''Total'''\n|'''28'''\n|'''1021&ndash;913 (.528)'''\n|'''28&ndash;37 (.431)'''\n|'''16'''\n|'''13'''\n|'''2'''\n|}\n\n==Season-by-season records==\n{| class=\"wikitable style=\"text-align:center; font-size:85%\"\n|align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#FFCCCC\"|League champions \u2020<br>\n|align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#ddffdd\"|Divisional champions *<br>\n|align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#D0E7FF\"|Playoff berth ^<br>\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:95%\"\n|-\n!scope=\"col\"|Season\n!scope=\"col\"|[[List of organized baseball leagues|League]]\n!scope=\"col\"|[[Division (sport)|Division]]\n!scope=\"col\"|Finish\n!scope=\"col\"|[[Win (baseball)|Wins]]\n!scope=\"col\"|[[Loss (baseball)|Losses]]\n!scope=\"col\"|[[Winning percentage|Win%]]\n!

During a road trip to [[Traverse City, Michigan]] in 2006, former Cy Young award winner [[Doug Drabek]] served as manager while Wilson was tending to things at his Texas home.\n\nIn late 2006, Wilson saw his contract not renewed, due to many reasons. That same day, the Paints organization named longtime [[Washington Wild Things]] assistant Mark Mason their new manager. Mason also managed the [[Ohio Valley Redcoats]], in 2005 winning the Roger Hanners Manager of the Year award.\n\nAfter 2008, Mark Mason was named the fourth manager of the Washington Wildthings replacing Greg Jelks. Mason will not be returning to the Paints in the Prospect league.\n\nThe Paints began play in the college wood-bat Prospect League in 2009 with former player Brian Mannino as manager. He was at the helm for the Paints first league championship win in franchise history in 2010 and managed through the 2011 season. Mannino continues to serve as Director of Baseball Operations, finding players and signing them each season.\n\nUniversity of Missouri Hall of Famer and former longtime Ohio State assistant Greg Cypret took over managing duties in 2012 and collected the second-most wins of any manager in Paints' history, behind only Roger Hanners. A stroke following the 2015 season forced Cypret to step away from managing, though he returned to the staff as an assistant coach beginning in 2017.\n\nCircleville native Brian Bigam took over managing duties in 2016 after guiding some of the best pitching staffs in the Prospect League as Chillicothe's Pitching Coach throughout several seasons. Bigam is currently the Paints' manager and helped the Paints to their 8th playoff appearance in 11 years of Prospect League play in 2019. The Paints led the Prospect League with the lowest ERA, fewest walks, and in several other categories in 2018. Bigam helped to guide the Paints to their second league championship in 2019. Again, the Paints boasted one of the best pitching staffs in the league, including the Reliever of the Year for the second-straight season.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+List of Managers\n!Name\n!Seasons\n!Regular Season Record\n!Post-season Record\n!Playoff App.\n!Divisional Titles\n!League Titles\n|-\n|Mark Jones\n|1\n|14&ndash;15 (.483)\n|0&ndash;0\n|0\n|0\n|0\n|-\n|Roger Hanners\n|8\n|289&ndash;267 (.520)\n|8&ndash;10 (.444)\n|4\n|4\n|0\n|-\n|Jamie Keefe\n|4\n|142&ndash;161 (.468)\n|3&ndash;6 (.333)\n|2\n|2\n|0\n|-\n|Glenn Wilson\n|2\n|111&ndash;79 (.584)\n|8&ndash;9 (.471)\n|2\n|2\n|0\n|-\n|Mark Mason\n|2\n|86&ndash;106 (.448)\n|0&ndash;0\n|0\n|0\n|0\n|-\n|Brian Mannino\n|3\n|98&ndash;72 (.576)\n|2&ndash;2 (.500)\n|2\n|2\n|1\n|-\n|Greg Cypret\n|4\n|152&ndash;98 (.608)\n|3&ndash;7 (.300)\n|4\n|2\n|0\n|-\n|Brian Bigam\n|4\n|129&ndash;115 (.529)\n|4&ndash;3 (.571)\n|2\n|1\n|1\n|-\n|'''Total'''\n|'''28'''\n|'''1021&ndash;913 (.528)'''\n|'''28&ndash;37 (.431)'''\n|'''16'''\n|'''13'''\n|'''2'''\n|}\n\n==Season-by-season records==\n{| class=\"wikitable style=\"text-align:center; font-size:85%\"\n|align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#FFCCCC\"|League champions \u2020<br>\n|align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#ddffdd\"|Divisional champions *<br>\n|align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#D0E7FF\"|Playoff berth ^<br>\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:95%\"\n|-\n!scope=\"col\"|Season\n!scope=\"col\"|[[List of organized baseball leagues|League]]\n!scope=\"col\"|[[Division (sport)|Division]]\n!scope=\"col\"|Finish\n!scope=\"col\"|[[Win (baseball)|Wins]]\n!scope=\"col\"|[[Loss (baseball)|Losses]]\n!scope=\"col\"|[[Winning percentage|Win%]]\n!

He is also well known for his portrayal of Rev. [[Charlie Andrews]] in the 1982 Oscar-winning film ''[[Gandhi (film)|Gandhi]]''.\n\nCharleson was a noted actor on the British stage as well, with critically acclaimed leads in ''[[Guys and Dolls]]'', ''[[Cat on a Hot Tin Roof]]'', ''[[Fool for Love (play)|Fool for Love]]'', and ''[[Hamlet]]'', among many others. He performed numerous [[Shakespeare]]an roles, and in 1991 the annual [[Ian Charleson Awards]] were established, particularly in honour of his final Hamlet.<ref name=rosenthal>Rosenthal, Daniel.

He made his professional stage debut in 1972 with the Young Vic, as one of the brothers in ''[[Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat]]'' (1972), which was also televised in the UK that same year by [[Granada Television]].<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1666317 ''Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat'' (TV, 1972)] at the [[Internet Movie Database]].</ref> In 1973, he starred as Jimmy Porter in ''[[Look Back in Anger]]'', and that year he was also Hamlet and later Guildenstern in the first revival of Tom  Stoppard's ''[[Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead]]''.  Also as part of the Young Vic company, Charleson was Claudio in ''[[Much Ado About Nothing]]'' in 1974. He traveled with the company to the [[Brooklyn Academy of Music]] in New York that same year, to appear as Lucentio in ''[[The Taming of the Shrew]]'', Ottavio in ''[[Les Fourberies de Scapin|Scapino]]'', and Brian Curtis in ''[[French Without Tears]]''.\n\nIn 1975, he played the title role in ''[[Hamlet]]'' in a [[Cambridge Theatre Company]] touring production. The performance garnered good reviews; nevertheless Charleson felt he had not done the notoriously difficult role complete justice.\n\n===West End and National Theatre debuts, Royal Shakespeare Company===\nCharleson made his [[West End theatre|West End]] debut in 1975, in a long-running production of Simon Gray's ''[[Otherwise Engaged]]'' at the [[Queen's Theatre]]. In it he played Dave, a surly Scottish lodger, opposite [[Alan Bates]].\n\nHe next appeared at the [[Royal National Theatre|National Theatre]], where he performed Octavius in ''[[Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar]]''  in 1977. That year he also played Peregrine in the classic play ''[[Volpone]]'', opposite [[John Gielgud]], and [[Captain Phoebus]] in ''[[The Hunchback of Notre Dame]]''.\n\nCharleson then spent a year in Stratford-upon-Avon with the [[Royal Shakespeare Company]] 1978\u201379. There he performed a hauntingly voiced Ariel in ''[[The Tempest]]''; Tranio in ''[[The Taming of the Shrew]]''; and Longaville in ''[[Love's Labour's Lost]]'' opposite [[Richard Griffiths]] as the King \u2013 all both in Stratford and at the [[Aldwych Theatre]] in London. Also with the RSC, he was Lawrence Vail in an acclaimed production of ''[[Once in a Lifetime (play)|Once in a Lifetime]]'' (1979) at the Aldwych Theatre, and he played Pierre in the [[Jane Lapotaire]] vehicle ''[[Piaf (play)|Piaf]]'', giving a performance which caught the eye of the filmmakers of ''[[Chariots of Fire]]''.\n\n===National Theatre spotlight===\n[[File:National Theatre, London.jpg|thumb|280px|At the [[Royal National Theatre|National Theatre]], Charleson appeared in ''[[Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar]]'', ''[[Volpone]]'', and ''[[The Hunchback of Notre Dame]]''.

And he was a highly praised Brick, the repressed homosexual protagonist in Tennessee Williams' ''[[Cat on a Hot Tin Roof]]'' (1988), opposite [[Lindsay Duncan]].\n\n===Final Hamlet===\nShortly before his death, while seriously ill from AIDS, from 9 October to 13 November 1989 Charleson performed his second run of ''[[Hamlet]]'', this time at the [[Royal National Theatre|National Theatre]] \u2013 giving a definitive performance which garnered major accolades.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=lZDCequ4E4kC&pg=PA170&vq=%22The+Readiness+Was+All%22&ie=ISO-8859-1&output=html&source=gbs_search_r&cad=1 \"The Readiness Was All: Ian Charleson and Richard Eyre's ''Hamlet''\"],  by Richard Allan Davison.

They then saw Charleson performing the role of Pierre in ''[[Piaf (play)|Piaf]]'', and knew immediately they had found their man.

He made his professional stage debut in 1972 with the Young Vic, as one of the brothers in ''[[Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat]]'' (1972), which was also televised in the UK that same year by [[Granada Television]].<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1666317 ''Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat'' (TV, 1972)] at the [[Internet Movie Database]].</ref> In 1973, he starred as Jimmy Porter in ''[[Look Back in Anger]]'', and that year he was also Hamlet and later Guildenstern in the first revival of Tom  Stoppard's ''[[Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead]]''.  Also as part of the Young Vic company, Charleson was Claudio in ''[[Much Ado About Nothing]]'' in 1974. He traveled with the company to the [[Brooklyn Academy of Music]] in New York that same year, to appear as Lucentio in ''[[The Taming of the Shrew]]'', Ottavio in ''[[Les Fourberies de Scapin|Scapino]]'', and Brian Curtis in ''[[French Without Tears]]''.\n\nIn 1975, he played the title role in ''[[Hamlet]]'' in a [[Cambridge Theatre Company]] touring production. The performance garnered good reviews; nevertheless Charleson felt he had not done the notoriously difficult role complete justice.\n\n===West End and National Theatre debuts, Royal Shakespeare Company===\nCharleson made his [[West End theatre|West End]] debut in 1975, in a long-running production of Simon Gray's ''[[Otherwise Engaged]]'' at the [[Queen's Theatre]]. In it he played Dave, a surly Scottish lodger, opposite [[Alan Bates]].\n\nHe next appeared at the [[Royal National Theatre|National Theatre]], where he performed Octavius in ''[[Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar]]''  in 1977. That year he also played Peregrine in the classic play ''[[Volpone]]'', opposite [[John Gielgud]], and [[Captain Phoebus]] in ''[[The Hunchback of Notre Dame]]''.\n\nCharleson then spent a year in Stratford-upon-Avon with the [[Royal Shakespeare Company]] 1978\u201379. There he performed a hauntingly voiced Ariel in ''[[The Tempest]]''; Tranio in ''[[The Taming of the Shrew]]''; and Longaville in ''[[Love's Labour's Lost]]'' opposite [[Richard Griffiths]] as the King \u2013 all both in Stratford and at the [[Aldwych Theatre]] in London. Also with the RSC, he was Lawrence Vail in an acclaimed production of ''[[Once in a Lifetime (play)|Once in a Lifetime]]'' (1979) at the Aldwych Theatre, and he played Pierre in the [[Jane Lapotaire]] vehicle ''[[Piaf (play)|Piaf]]'', giving a performance which caught the eye of the filmmakers of ''[[Chariots of Fire]]''.\n\n===National Theatre spotlight===\n[[File:National Theatre, London.jpg|thumb|280px|At the [[Royal National Theatre|National Theatre]], Charleson appeared in ''[[Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar]]'', ''[[Volpone]]'', and ''[[The Hunchback of Notre Dame]]''. His acclaimed starring roles there were in ''[[Guys and Dolls (musical)|Guys and Dolls]]'', ''[[Fool for Love (play)|Fool for Love]]'', ''[[Cat on a Hot Tin Roof]]'', and ''[[Hamlet]]''.]]\nIn the 1980s, Charleson won particular critical and popular acclaim for his starring roles at the National Theatre. He was a glowingly reviewed Sky Masterson in [[Richard Eyre]]'s enormously successful revival of the musical ''[[Guys and Dolls (musical)|Guys and Dolls]]'' (1982), opposite [[Julie Covington]] as Sister Sarah, with [[Bob Hoskins]] as Nathan Detroit and [[Julia McKenzie]] as Adelaide.\n\nCharleson received an [[Olivier Award]] nomination for [[Laurence Olivier Award for Actor of the Year in a New Play|Actor of the Year in a New Play]] as Eddie in [[Sam Shepard]]'s gritty and very physical two-person drama, ''[[Fool for Love (play)|Fool for Love]]'' (1984\u201385), opposite [[Julie Walters]] as his on-again off-again love object. And he was a highly praised Brick, the repressed homosexual protagonist in Tennessee Williams' ''[[Cat on a Hot Tin Roof]]'' (1988), opposite [[Lindsay Duncan]].\n\n===Final Hamlet===\nShortly before his death, while seriously ill from AIDS, from 9 October to 13 November 1989 Charleson performed his second run of ''[[Hamlet]]'', this time at the [[Royal National Theatre|National Theatre]] \u2013 giving a definitive performance which garnered major accolades.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=lZDCequ4E4kC&pg=PA170&vq=%22The+Readiness+Was+All%22&ie=ISO-8859-1&output=html&source=gbs_search_r&cad=1 \"The Readiness Was All: Ian Charleson and Richard Eyre's ''Hamlet''\"],  by Richard Allan Davison.

They then saw Charleson performing the role of Pierre in ''[[Piaf (play)|Piaf]]'', and knew immediately they had found their man. Unbeknownst to them, Charleson had heard about the film from his father, and desperately wanted to play the part, feeling it would \"fit like a kid glove\".<ref>Ian McKellen, Hugh Hudson, Alan Bates, et al. For Ian Charleson: A Tribute. London: Constable and Company, 1990. pp. xix, 9, 76.</ref> This mutual affinity led to Charleson's best-known film role and success \u2013 as the athlete and missionary Eric Liddell in ''[[Chariots of Fire]]'' (1981). Charleson prepared for the role by studying the Bible intensively, and he himself wrote Liddell's stirring post-race address to the workingmen's crowd.<ref>McKellen, Bates, Hudson, et al. pp. 37\u201339.</ref> This film and role made him an international celebrity.<ref>[http://www.screenonline.org.uk/people/id/562087/index.html \"Charleson, Ian (1949-1990)\"].

Like ''Chariots of Fire'', the film ''Gandhi'' won numerous [[Academy Award]]s, including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]].\n\n===Other film work===\nAfter these two major successes in these two Best Picture Oscar\u2013winning films, Charleson's film career did not, however, follow the same progressive arc that his stage career did.

Ryder in the [[Golden Bear]]-winning \"Irish question\" film ''[[Ascendancy (film)|Ascendancy]]'' (1982), which starred [[Julie Covington]]; a small role as the abusive drunk Jeffson Brown in ''[[Greystoke: The Legend of Tarzan, Lord of the Apes|Greystoke: The Legend of Tarzan]]'' (1984); a comedic turn as Gerald Spong in the rather ill-fated ''[[Car Trouble (film)|Car Trouble]]'' (1985), opposite his friend [[Julie Walters]]; and opera director Marco in [[Dario Argento]]'s horror film ''[[Opera (film)|Opera]]'' (1987).\n\n===Television: Shakespeare, TV films, and teleplays===\nCharleson performed in three [[BBC Television Shakespeare]] films: as Fortinbras in ''[[Hamlet]]'' (1980) starring [[Derek Jacobi]]; the protagonist Bertram in the acclaimed production of ''[[All's Well That Ends Well]]'' (1981); and Octavius Caesar in ''[[Antony & Cleopatra]]'' (1981) opposite his frequent co-star [[Jane Lapotaire]] as Cleopatra.\n\nHis other notable [[Television film|made-for-television film]] roles include: the titular Lieutenant Dorfrichter in M.

Farrell's [[Man Booker Prize|Booker Award]]-winning ''[[Troubles (novel)|Troubles]]'' (1988), opposite [[Ian Richardson]].\n\nCharleson's notable starring television roles in the 1970s include: Anthony in ''A Private Matter'' (1974), his first starring screen role, opposite [[Rachel Kempson]]; slick and cruel John Ross preying on Scottish immigrants to the New World in ''O Canada'' (1975) in the anthology series ''[[Churchill's People]]''; and one of two British soldiers who find military life nearly unbearable in ''The Paradise Run'' (1976), directed by [[Michael Apted]].\n\nIn the 1980s his notable starring TV roles included: [[Alexander the Great]]'s close companion [[Hephaistion]] in the PBS miniseries ''[[The Search for Alexander the Great]]''; serial killer [[Neville Heath]] in an episode of the murder-trial reenactment series ''Ladykillers'' (1981); naive Scot turned powerful South African magnate Jamie MacGregor in the miniseries ''[[Master of the Game (novel)#Adaptations|Master of the Game]]'' (1984); romantic lead Clarence Dandridge in the period miniseries ''[[Louisiana (1984 film)|Louisiana]]'' (1984) opposite [[Margot Kidder]]; and protagonist Victor Geary in the stylish and clever ''[[Oxbridge Blues]]'' (1984), written by [[Frederic Raphael]], directed by [[James Cellan Jones]], and co-starring [[Amanda Redman]], [[Rosalyn Landor]], and [[Malcolm Stoddard]].\n\n==Singing work==\nCharleson used his tenor singing voice in musicals and other performances. He did notable solo singing work in productions including ''[[Much Ado About Nothing]]'' (1974), an episode of ''[[Rock Follies|Rock Follies of '77]]'' (1977)'', [[The Tempest]]'' (1978\u20131979), ''[[Piaf (play)|Piaf]]'' (1978\u20131980), ''[[Guys and Dolls]]'' (1982), ''A Royal Night of One Hundred Stars'' (1985), ''[[After Aida]]'' (1985\u20131986), Andrew Lloyd Webber's and Tim Rice's ''[[Cricket (musical)|Cricket]]'' (1986), ''Sondheim: A Celebration'' (1988 benefit for [[Crusaid]]), and ''[[Bent (play)|Bent]]'' (1989). He also sang classic standards and [[show tunes]], and the songs of [[Robert Burns]], in variety programmes on stage and television.\n\nThree commercial recordings have been issued that include Charleson's singing:\n*The National Theatre cast album of ''[[Guys and Dolls (musical)|Guys and Dolls]]'' (1982)\n*Charleson singing ''Ariel's Songs'' from ''[[The Tempest]]'', issued by the [[Royal Shakespeare Company]]; music by [[Guy Woolfenden]]\n*The Original London Cast Album of ''[[Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat]]'' (ensemble only)\n\nCharleson also sings a solo ballad on an episode (\"The Empire\") of the television series ''[[Rock Follies|Rock Follies of '77]]''.\n\n==Death==\nCharleson, who was gay, was diagnosed with HIV in 1986, and died of [[AIDS]]-related causes in January 1990 at the age of 40. He died eight weeks after performing the title role in a run of ''[[Hamlet]]'', in [[Richard Eyre|Richard Eyre's]] production at the [[Royal National Theatre|Olivier Theatre]].

Egbert was the Count of [[County of Brunswick|Brunswick]] from about 1038, when his father, [[Liudolf, Margrave of Frisia]], died. His mother was Gertrude, the sister of [[Pope Leo IX]].\n\nEgbert was the scion of the influential [[Eastphalia]]n family of the [[Brunonen]].

Pharming can be conducted either by changing the [[hosts file]] on a victim's computer or by [[Exploit (computer security)|exploitation]] of a [[vulnerability (computing)|vulnerability]] in [[Domain name system|DNS server]] [[software]]. DNS servers are computers responsible for resolving Internet names into their real [[IP address]]es. Compromised DNS servers are sometimes referred to as [[DNS spoofing|\"poisoned\"]].\nPharming requires unprotected access to target a computer, such as altering a customer's home computer, rather than a corporate business server.\n\nThe term \"pharming\" is a [[neologism]] based on the words \"farming\" and \"[[phishing]]\". Phishing is a type of [[social engineering (computer security)|social-engineering]] attack to obtain [[Authentication|access credentials]], such as [[user name]]s and [[password]]s. In recent years, both pharming and phishing have been used to gain information for [[online identity theft]]. Pharming has become of major concern to businesses hosting [[ecommerce]] and [[online banking]] websites. Sophisticated measures known as [[anti-pharming]] are required to protect against this serious [[threat (computer)|threat]]. [[Antivirus software]] and [[spyware removal software]] cannot protect against pharming.\n\n== Pharming vulnerability at home and work ==\n\nWhile malicious domain-name resolution can result from compromises in the large numbers of trusted nodes that participate in a name lookup, the most vulnerable points of compromise are near the leaves of the Internet. For instance, incorrect entries in a desktop computer's ''[[hosts file]]'', which circumvents name lookup with its own local name to IP address mapping, is a popular target for malware. Once rewritten, a legitimate request for a sensitive website can direct the user to a fraudulent copy. Personal computers such as [[Desktop computer|desktops]] and [[Laptop|laptops]] are often better targets for pharming because they receive poorer administration than most Internet servers.\n\nMore worrisome than host-file attacks is the compromise of a local [[network router]].<ref>\n{{cite news\n| url=http://www.cs.indiana.edu/~atsow/mal-router\n| title=Can You Trust a Wireless Router?\n| date=February 24, 2006\n| publisher=Indiana University Bloomington}}</ref> Since most routers specify a trusted DNS to clients as they join the network, misinformation here will spoil lookups for the entire [[Local Area Network|LAN]]. Unlike host-file rewrites, local-router compromise is difficult to detect. Routers can pass bad DNS information in two ways: malconfiguration of existing settings or wholesale rewrite of [[embedded software]] (aka [[firmware]]). Many routers allow the administrator to specify a particular, trusted DNS in place of the one suggested by an upstream node (e.g., the [[Internet Service Provider|ISP]]). An attacker could specify a DNS server under his control instead of a legitimate one. All subsequent resolutions would go through the bad server. A scenario involving malicious [[JavaScript]] that changes the router's DNS server is called ''drive-by pharming'' and was demonstrated by Stamm, Ramzan and Jakobsson in a December 2006 technical report.<ref>\n{{cite news\n| url=http://www.cs.indiana.edu/cgi-bin/techreports/TRNNN.cgi?trnum=TR641\n| title=Drive-By Pharming\n| date=December 13, 2006\n| publisher=Indiana University Bloomington}}</ref>\n\nAlternatively, many routers have the ability to replace their [[firmware]] (i.e. the internal software that executes the device's more complex services). Like malware on desktop systems, a firmware replacement can be very difficult to detect. A stealthy implementation will appear to behave the same as the manufacturer's firmware; the administration page will look the same, settings will appear correct, etc. This approach, if well executed, could make it difficult for network administrators to discover the reconfiguration, if the device appears to be configured as the administrators intend but actually redirects DNS traffic in the background. Pharming is only one of many attacks that malicious firmware can mount; others include eavesdropping, active [[man in the middle attack]]s, and traffic logging. Like misconfiguration, the entire LAN is subject to these actions.\n\nBy themselves, these pharming approaches have only academic interest. However, the ubiquity of consumer grade [[wireless router]]s presents a massive [[vulnerability (computing)|vulnerability]]. Administrative access can be available wirelessly on most of these devices. Moreover, since these routers often work with their default settings, administrative passwords are commonly unchanged. Even when altered, many are guessed quickly through [[dictionary attack]]s, since most consumer grade routers don't introduce timing penalties for incorrect login attempts. Once administrative access is granted, all of the router's settings including the firmware itself may be altered.
