Infertility affects women from around the world, and the cultural and social stigma surrounding it varies.\n\n==Cause==\nCauses or factors of female infertility can basically be classified regarding whether they are [[Acquired disorder|acquired]] or genetic, or strictly by location.\n\nAlthough factors of female infertility can be classified as either acquired or genetic, female infertility is usually more or less a combination of [[nature and nurture]]. Also, the presence of any single [[risk factor]] of female infertility (such as smoking, mentioned further below) does not necessarily cause infertility, and even if a woman is definitely infertile, the infertility cannot definitely be blamed on any single risk factor even if the risk factor is (or has been) present.\n\n===Acquired===\nAccording to the [[American Society for Reproductive Medicine]] (ASRM), age, smoking, sexually transmitted infections, and being overweight or underweight can all affect fertility.<ref>http://www.fertilityfaq.org/_pdf/magazine1_v4.pdf{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nIn broad sense, acquired factors practically include any factor that is not based on a [[genetic mutation]], including any [[Environmental toxins in pregnancy|intrauterine exposure to toxins during fetal development]], which may present as infertility many years later as an adult.\n\n====Age====\n{{Main|Age and female fertility}}\nA woman's fertility is affected by her age.

The chances of a couple to successfully conceive at an advanced age depend on many factors, including the general health of a woman and the fertility of the male partner.\n\n====Tobacco smoking====\n{{See also|Women and smoking#Unique gender differences and health effects for Females}}\n[[Tobacco smoking]] is harmful to the ovaries, and the degree of damage is dependent upon the amount and length of time a woman smokes or is exposed to a smoke-filled environment.

The practice is primarily focused on helping their women to conceive and to correct any issues related to recurring pregnancy loss.\n\n===Definition===\nThere is no unanimous definition of female infertility, because the definition depends on social and physical characteristics which may vary by culture and situation.

Excessive exercise, consumption of [[caffeine]] and [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]], and [[smoking]] have all been  associated with decreased fertility.  Eating a well-balanced, nutritious diet, with plenty of fresh [[fruit]]s and [[vegetable]]s, and maintaining a normal weight, on the other hand, have been associated with better fertility prospects. \n* ''Treating or preventing existing diseases.''  Identifying and controlling chronic diseases such as [[diabetes]] and [[hypothyroidism]] increases fertility prospects.  Lifelong practice of [[safer sex]] reduces the likelihood that [[sexually transmitted disease]]s will impair fertility; obtaining prompt treatment for sexually transmitted diseases reduces the likelihood that such infections will do significant damage.  Regular [[physical examination]]s (including pap smears) help detect early signs of infections or abnormalities.\n* ''Not delaying parenthood.''

However, the greatest rates occurred in Jamaica, Suriname, Haiti, and Trinidad and Tobago.

Infertility affects women from around the world, and the cultural and social stigma surrounding it varies.\n\n==Cause==\nCauses or factors of female infertility can basically be classified regarding whether they are [[Acquired disorder|acquired]] or genetic, or strictly by location.\n\nAlthough factors of female infertility can be classified as either acquired or genetic, female infertility is usually more or less a combination of [[nature and nurture]]. Also, the presence of any single [[risk factor]] of female infertility (such as smoking, mentioned further below) does not necessarily cause infertility, and even if a woman is definitely infertile, the infertility cannot definitely be blamed on any single risk factor even if the risk factor is (or has been) present.\n\n===Acquired===\nAccording to the [[American Society for Reproductive Medicine]] (ASRM), age, smoking, sexually transmitted infections, and being overweight or underweight can all affect fertility.<ref>http://www.fertilityfaq.org/_pdf/magazine1_v4.pdf{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nIn broad sense, acquired factors practically include any factor that is not based on a [[genetic mutation]], including any [[Environmental toxins in pregnancy|intrauterine exposure to toxins during fetal development]], which may present as infertility many years later as an adult.\n\n====Age====\n{{Main|Age and female fertility}}\nA woman's fertility is affected by her age.

Excessive exercise, consumption of [[caffeine]] and [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]], and [[smoking]] have all been  associated with decreased fertility.  Eating a well-balanced, nutritious diet, with plenty of fresh [[fruit]]s and [[vegetable]]s, and maintaining a normal weight, on the other hand, have been associated with better fertility prospects. \n* ''Treating or preventing existing diseases.''  Identifying and controlling chronic diseases such as [[diabetes]] and [[hypothyroidism]] increases fertility prospects.  Lifelong practice of [[safer sex]] reduces the likelihood that [[sexually transmitted disease]]s will impair fertility; obtaining prompt treatment for sexually transmitted diseases reduces the likelihood that such infections will do significant damage.  Regular [[physical examination]]s (including pap smears) help detect early signs of infections or abnormalities.\n* ''Not delaying parenthood.''  Fertility does not ultimately cease before menopause, but it starts declining after age 27 and drops at a somewhat greater rate after age 35.<ref name=\"titleStudy speeds up biological clocks / Fertility rates dip after women hit 27\">{{cite news |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2002/04/30/MN182697.DTL |title=Study speeds up biological clocks / Fertility rates dip after women hit 27 |accessdate=2007-11-21 |work=The San Francisco Chronicle | first=Carl T. | last=Hall |date=April 30, 2002}}</ref>  Women whose biological mothers had unusual or abnormal issues related to conceiving may be at particular risk for some conditions, such as [[premature menopause]], that can be mitigated by not delaying parenthood.\n* ''[[oocyte cryopreservation|Egg freezing]].'' A woman can freeze her eggs preserve her fertility. By using [[egg freezing]] while in the peak reproductive years, a woman's [[oocytes]] are cryogenically frozen and ready for her use later in life, reducing her chances of female infertility.\n\n==Treatment==\nThere is no method to reverse [[advanced maternal age]], but there are [[assisted reproductive technologies]] for many causes of infertility in pre-menopausal women, including:\n*[[Ovulation induction]] for [[anovulation]]\n*[[In vitro fertilization]] in for example tubal abnormalities\n\n<br />\n\n==Epidemiology==\nFemale infertility varies widely by geographic location around the world.  In 2010, there was an estimated 48.5 million infertile couples worldwide, and from 1990 to 2010 there was little change in levels of infertility in most of the world.<ref name=\"Mascarenhas, M.N. 2012\"/>\nIn 2010, the countries with the lowest rates of female infertility included the South American countries of Peru, Ecuador and Bolivia, as well as in Poland, Kenya, and Republic of Korea.<ref name=\"Mascarenhas, M.N. 2012\"/>  The highest rate regions included Eastern Europe, North Africa, the Middle East, Oceania, and Sub-Saharan Africa.<ref name=\"Mascarenhas, M.N. 2012\"/>  The prevalence of primary infertility has increased since 1990, but secondary infertility has decreased overall.  Rates decreased (although not prevalence) of female infertility in high-income, Central/Eastern Europe, and Central Asia regions.<ref name=\"Mascarenhas, M.N. 2012\"/>\n\n===Africa===\n\nSub-Saharan Africa has had decreasing levels of primary infertility from 1990 to 2010.  Within the Sub-Saharan region, rates were lowest in Kenya, Zimbabwe, and Rwanda, while the highest rates were in Guinea, Mozambique, Angola, Gabon, and Cameroon along with Northern Africa near the Middle East.<ref name=\"Mascarenhas, M.N. 2012\"/>  According to a 2004 DHS report, rates in Africa were highest in Middle and Sub-Saharan Africa, with East Africa\u2019s rates close behind.<ref name=\"Rutstein 2004\" />\n\n===Asia===\n\nIn Asia, the highest rates of combined secondary and primary infertility was in the South Central region, and then in the Southeast region, with the lowest rates in the Western areas.<ref name=\"Rutstein 2004\" />\n\n===Latin America and Caribbean===\n\nThe prevalence of female infertility in the Latin America/Caribbean region is typically lower than the global prevalence.  However, the greatest rates occurred in Jamaica, Suriname, Haiti, and Trinidad and Tobago.  Central and Western Latin America has some of the lowest rates of prevalence.<ref name=\"Mascarenhas, M.N. 2012\"/>  The highest regions in Latin America and the Caribbean was in the Caribbean Islands and in less developed countries.<ref name=\"Rutstein 2004\" />\n\n==Society and culture==\n\n===Social stigma===\n\nSocial stigma due to [[infertility]] is seen in many cultures throughout the world in varying forms.  Often, when women cannot conceive, the blame is put on them, even when approximately 50% of [[infertility]] issues come from the man .<ref name=\"WHO 2010\">{{cite journal | author = WHO  | year = 2010 | title = Mother or nothing: the agony of infertility | url = | journal = Bulletin of the World Health Organization | volume = 88 | issue = 12| pages = 881\u2013882 | doi = 10.2471/BLT.10.011210 | pmid = 21124709 | pmc = 2995184}}</ref>\nIn addition, many societies only tend to value a woman if she is able to produce at least one child, and a marriage can be considered a failure when the couple cannot [[conceive]].<ref name=\"WHO 2010\"/> The act of conceiving a child can be linked to the couple\u2019s consummation of marriage, and reflect their social role in society.<ref name=\"Araoye, M. O. 2003\"/> This is seen in the \"African infertility belt\", where infertility is prevalent in Africa which includes countries spanning from [[Tanzania]] in the east to [[Gabon]] in the west.<ref name=\"WHO 2010\"/>  In this region, infertility is highly stigmatized and can be considered a failure of the couple to their societies.<ref name=\"WHO 2010\"/><ref name=\"Leke 1993 \">Robert J.

O. 2003\"/>  This is also seen in some Muslim societies including [[Egypt]] <ref name=\"Inhorn, M. C. 2003\"/> and Pakistan.<ref name=\"Dyer, S.

(2012). \"The economic impact of infertility on women in developing countries \u2013 a systematic review.\" FVV in ObGyn: 38-45.</ref>  Children can influence financial security in many ways.  In Nigeria and [[Cameroon]], [[Land claim|land claims]] are decided by the number of children.  Also, in some Sub-Saharan countries women may be denied [[inheritance]] if she did not bear any children <ref name=\"Dyer, S. J. 2012\"/>  In some African and Asian countries a husband can deprive his infertile wife of food, shelter and other basic necessities like clothing.<ref name=\"Dyer, S. J. 2012\"/>  In Cameroon, a woman may lose access to land from her husband and left on her own in old age.<ref name=\"Araoye, M. O. 2003\"/>\n\nIn many cases, a woman who cannot bear children is excluded from social and cultural events including traditional ceremonies.  This stigmatization is seen in [[Mozambique]] and Nigeria where infertile women have been treated as outcasts to society.<ref name=\"Araoye, M. O. 2003\"/> This is a humiliating practice which devalues infertile women in society.<ref name=\"Gerrits, T. 1997\"/><ref name=\"Whiteford, L. M. 1995\">Whiteford, L. M. (1995). \"STIGMA: THE HIDDEN BURDEN OF INFERTILITY.\" Sot. Sci. Med. (40;1): 27-36.</ref> In the [[Makua people|Makua]] tradition, pregnancy and birth are considered major life events for a woman, with the ceremonies of nthaa\u00b4ra and ntha\u00b4ara no mwana, which can only be attended by women who have been pregnant and have had a baby.<ref name=\"Gerrits, T. 1997\"/>\n\nThe effect of infertility can lead to social shaming from internal and [[social norms]] surrounding pregnancy, which affects women around the world.<ref name=\"Whiteford, L. M. 1995\"/> When pregnancy is considered such an important event in life, and considered a \u201csocially unacceptable condition\u201d, it can lead to a search for treatment in the form of traditional healers and expensive Western treatments.<ref name=\"Inhorn, M. C. 2003\"/> The limited access to treatment in many areas can lead to extreme and sometimes illegal acts in order to produce a child.<ref name=\"Araoye, M. O. 2003\"/><ref name=\"Inhorn, M. C. 2003\"/>\n\n===Marital role===\n\nMen in some countries may find another wife when their first cannot produce a child, hoping that by sleeping with more women he will be able to produce his own child.<ref name=\"Araoye, M. O. 2003\">Araoye, M. O. (2003). \"Epidemiology of infertility: social problems of the infertile couples.\" West African journal of medicine (22;2): 190-196.</ref><ref name=\"Inhorn, M.

(1997). \"Social and cultural aspects of infertility in Mozambique.\" Patient Education and Counseling (31): 39-48.</ref> This can be done for many reasons including advice from a traditional healer, or finding if another man was \"more compatible\".  In many cases, the husband was not aware of the extra sexual relations and would not be informed if a woman became pregnant by another man.<ref name=\"Gerrits, T. 1997\"/> This is not as culturally acceptable however, and can contribute to the gendered suffering of women who have fewer options to become pregnant on their own as opposed to men.<ref name=\"Inhorn, M. C. 2003\"/>\n\nMen and women can also turn to [[divorce]] in attempt to find a new partner with whom to bear a child.  Infertility in many cultures is a reason for divorce, and a way for a man or woman to increase his/her chances of producing an heir.<ref name=\"Araoye, M. O. 2003\"/><ref name=\"Inhorn, M. C. 2003\"/><ref name=\"Gerrits, T. 1997\"/><ref name=\"Mogobe, D. K. 2005\"/> When a woman is divorced, she can lose her security that often comes with land, wealth, and a family.<ref name=\"Mogobe, D. K. 2005\"/> This can ruin marriages and can lead to distrust in the marriage.  The increase of sexual partners can potentially result with the spread of disease including [[HIV/AIDS]], and can actually contribute to future generations of infertility.<ref name=\"Mogobe, D. K. 2005\"/>\n\n===Domestic abuse===\n\nThe emotional strain and stress that comes with infertility in the household can lead to the mistreatment and [[domestic abuse]] of a woman.  \nThe devaluation of a wife due to her inability to conceive can lead to domestic abuse and emotional trauma such as [[victim blaming]].  Women are sometimes or often blamed as the cause of a couples' infertility, which can lead to [[emotional abuse]], anxiety, and shame.<ref name=\"Araoye, M. O. 2003\"/>  In addition, blame for not being able to conceive is often put on the female, even if it is the man who is infertile.<ref name=\"WHO 2010\"/> Women who are not able to conceive can be starved, beaten, and may be neglected financially by her husband as if she had no child bearing use to him.<ref name=\"Dyer, S. J. 2012\"/> The physical abuse related to infertility may result from this and the [[emotional stress]] that comes with it.  In some countries, the emotional and physical abuses that come with infertility can potentially lead to [[assault]], [[murder]], and [[suicide]].<ref name=\"Omberlet, W. 2012\">Omberlet, W. (2012). \"Global access to infertility care in developing countries: a case of human rights, equity and social justice \" FVV in ObGyn: 7-16.</ref>\n\n===Mental and psychological impact===\n\nMany infertile women tend to cope with immense stress and [[social stigma]] behind their condition, which can lead to considerable [[mental distress]].<ref name=\"McQuillian, J. 2003\">McQuillian, J., Greil, A.L., White, L., Jacob, M.C.

It was formed from a project originally titled ''Project Canvas'', which was rebranded as YouView in September 2010. The service was due to launch by the end of that year, but was delayed until 4 July 2012. At its launch, YouView's chairman [[Alan Sugar]] stated his ambition for the service to replace [[Freeview (UK)|Freeview]] devices.\n\nYouView provides access to free-to-air [[digital terrestrial television]] (DTT) channels (both DVB-T and [[DVB-T2]] channels in common with the [[Freeview (UK)|Freeview]] television platform) and to [[TV on demand]] (catch-up TV) services via a 'hybrid' [[set-top box]] (STB) purchased by users, connected with both a [[Internet access#Broadband access|broadband internet connection]] ''and'' a normal [[television aerial]]. No contract is required, and there is no subscription charge. Catch-up and on-demand content is delivered over the internet, which may be chargeable by the [[Internet service provider]] (ISP), or subject to limits and [[fair usage clause]]s.\n\n[[BT Group|BT]] and [[TalkTalk Group|TalkTalk]] have each partnered with YouView, allowing BT subsidiaries [[BT TV]] and [[Plusnet]]'s 'YouView TV from Plusnet' service, and [[TalkTalk TV]] customers to access the service, along with BT's and TalkTalk's own offerings. Both companies provide customers with their own branded YouView set-top box.\n\n==YouView content==\nThe YouView hardware is a [[digital terrestrial television]] [[DVB-T2]] HD set-top box that provides viewing and recording of all free-to-air channels available on [[digital terrestrial television in the United Kingdom]].  There is no access to some streamed channels in the 225\u2013256 range on [[Freeview (UK)|Freeview]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.a516digital.com/p/youview-channel-listing.html|title=YouView channel list \u2013 BT TV, TalkTalk TV, Plusnet TV|website=a516digital}}</ref> as YouView lacks support for the [[MHEG-5]] integration channel used by these channels to provide them over IP.{{clarify|date=October 2017}}\n\nAdditional content is provided over a broadband internet connection, with channels that can be viewed and recorded in the same way as the free-to-air channels and can also be accessed via the YouView menu and [[EPG]] via the search function.\n\nThere are{{when|date=October 2017}}<!--use the template {{as of|YYYY|MM|df=y|lc=y}}--> ten free catch up TV players available, providing access to TV programming and movies: [[BBC iPlayer]], [[ITV Hub]], [[All 4]], [[My5]], [[STV Player]], [[Milkshake!]], [[UKTV Play]], [[S4C]], POP FUN and [[Quest (TV channel)|Quest]].

Content that TalkTalk provides, such as film rentals and box sets, are available from the TalkTalk Player [[application software|application]] within the YouView menu bar.  In the TalkTalk Player, there are 'boosts' that customers can buy for a minimum of one month, and customers can watch and record them from the main guide the same as Freeview channels.  These boosts range from Sky premium channels, sports, TV box sets, films, and foreign language channels.  TalkTalk use their own brand of [[Huawei]]-manufactured boxes, with the TalkTalk logo on the front, a remote control with a direct button on the TalkTalk Player, and a 320&nbsp;[[Gigabyte|GB]] hard drive for Plus TV customers.  Essentials customers cannot record, but can still pause live TV.  Unlike BT, customers do not need a fibre broadband package to access the service.\n\n===Expand to other platforms===\nOn 29 July 2013 it was revealed that the YouView partners intended to launch the service on [[smartphone]]s, [[tablet computer|tablets]], and [[smart TV]]s, three days after [[BSkyB]] announced the \u00a310 [[Now TV (Sky plc)|Now TV]] set-top box which streams on demand content.<ref>https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/news/10209196/YouView-to-launch-on-tablets-and-smart-TVs.html YouView to launch on tablets and smart TVs</ref>\n\n==History==\n'''''Project Canvas''''' was initially announced on 11 December 2008 as a partnership between the BBC, BT and ITV plc.  It followed the failure of [[Kangaroo (video on demand)|Project Kangaroo]], a proposed video-on-demand service offering content from [[BBC Worldwide]], [[ITV.com]], and Channel 4's 4oD, which was blocked on competition grounds, and ended up as the [[SeeSaw (Internet television)|SeeSaw]] internet television service.  Project Canvas differed from Kangaroo, however, in that it was a proposed TV platform (a device that would deliver internet-connected TV), rather than a video-on-demand service (that would act as a single content portal, much like the music video equivalent [[VEVO]]).\n\nOn 30 July 2009, Project Canvas announced that Five had signed up to the project.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ProjectCanvas.info/index.cfm/news/?mode=alias&alias=First-Developer-Article|title=Five enters canvas partnership|website=ProjectCanvas.info|publisher=Project Canvas|date=30 July 2009}}</ref> On 9 July 2010, Five announced that it would not pursue further involvement in Project Canvas, pending a review of its digital investment strategy.

Our position on this matter remains unchanged.  As it stands, Canvas will severely restrict competition and innovation and ultimately this will harm consumers\".  A spokesman for [[British Sky Broadcasting]] (BSkyB) said: \"The BBC's involvement in Canvas is an unnecessary use of public funds.

on Project Canvas, the [[Digital TV Group]] said that there is \"widespread concern\" that the venture's partners are developing critical technology standards that do not involve key players such as set top-box manufacturers and TV makers.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2010/feb/04/project-canvas-digital-tv-group|title=TV makers and retailers voice concerns over Project Canvas|work=The Guardian|date=4 February 2010 | location=London | first=Mark | last=Sweney | accessdate=22 May 2010}}</ref> The DTG argue that the BBC Trust's provisional approval document does not contain a \"clear and unequivocal condition\" that Project Canvas will have to work with industry and there appears to be a \"parallel process\" taking place where Project Canvas and its preferred technology partners are developing a separate standard.\n\n[[Morgan Stanley]] compiled a creative analysis for BT about the potential impact of Canvas, describing it as \"[[Freeview (UK)|Freeview]] 2.0\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/digitaltv/news/a203561/report-canvas-will-be-freeview-20.html|title=Report: 'Canvas will be Freeview 2.0'|publisher=Digital Spy|date=16 February 2010}}</ref> Morgan Stanley noted that the BBC Trust will reach a final decision on the BBC's Canvas involvement at the end of March. If it gives the full green light, then the platform could enter launch phase by the end of the year or in early 2011. However, Morgan Stanley noted that any launch date would be dependent on the completion of major technical work, such as locking down specifications with manufacturers and also creating a workable electronic programming guide. Morgan Stanley expects that Canvas set-top boxes will cost between \u00a3150 and \u00a3200. The report predicts that an [[App Store (iOS)|App Store]]-style resource could be introduced to Canvas in the future, along with the integration of social networks such as [[Twitter]]. As Canvas will be an open platform, the report noted that content providers would no longer need to pay the current sum of around \u00a310m for capacity on [[digital terrestrial television]] to reach their target audience. Internet service providers would also benefit from the service due an increased consumer demand for fixed broadband packages, along with greater opportunities to sell more expensive tariffs for high definition streaming. Storing popular programmes on local Canvas drives would also ease the burden of heavy streaming traffic over broadband networks. Considering outstanding issues facing the project, Morgan Stanley said: \"Canvas looks pro-competitive (breaking down platform barriers for content owners), but some media companies could still try to challenge its creation. \"It looks unlikely that this could freeze launch however as content is not being aggregated and the BBC shareholding will be only 16.6%.\"\n\nOn 4 March 2010, ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' learned that Neil Berkett, [[Virgin Media]]'s chief executive, would tell the Cable Congress in Brussels \"the BBC Trust's consultation has been a shameless whitewash that contravenes almost every principle of good regulation.\"<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/mediatechnologyandtelecoms/media/7362359/Virgin-Media-attacks-BBC-Trust-over-Project-Canvas.html|title=Virgin Media attacks BBC Trust over Project Canvas|work=The Daily Telegraph|date=4 March 2010 | location=London | first=Rupert | last=Neate | accessdate=22 May 2010}}</ref> Mr Berkett objects to proposals to force all broadcasters to use a single 'Project Canvas' brand controlled by the BBC and its partners, which he claims will penalise commercial rivals. \"The BBC Trust has stubbornly ignored all requests to address our concerns by imposing safeguards to prevent the BBC emerging as de facto gatekeeper of the digital world. This is a blatant demonstration that the Trust is incapable of regulating the BBC's activities in an objective way.\" On 28 April 2010, Neil Berkett confirmed that Virgin Media had made a submission to the Office of Fair Trading over Project Canvas.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2010/apr/28/virgin-media-sky-sports|title=Virgin Media eyes HD as it battles Sky for lower sports charges|work=The Guardian|date=28 April 2010 | location=London | first=Mark | last=Sweney | accessdate=22 May 2010}}</ref> \"Canvas needs to be an open platform but it is closed and will require a [second] dedicated set-top box,\" said Berkett. \"We will oppose it vigorously if it is not an open world at large for customers to take advantage of. [The current proposals] are asking pay-TV customers to buy a second set-top box.\" He added that he considered it a misuse of the licence fee to create a product that was not accessible to all the public. \"It is funded by the BBC licence fee and should be available everywhere, on a Virgin Box, a PS3 and even a Sky box,\" he said. \"I find it extraordinary that it looks like the BBC Trust is endorsing what is a closed product. It is inappropriate for the BBC to be doing this.\"\n\nOn 14 June 2010, Neil Berkett revealed to The Guardian that \"Far from trying to block the development of these open standards, we have offered to work commercially with Canvas to explore mutually beneficial ways in which we could incorporate them as a self-contained service in the next generation of Virgin Media set-top boxes.\"<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/organgrinder/2010/jun/14/project-canvas-neil-berkett|title=Neil Berkett: why Virgin Media wants to work with Project Canvas|work=The Guardian|date=14 June 2010 | location=London | first=Neil | last=Berkett | accessdate=14 June 2010}}</ref> Berkett went on to explain his opposition to the project; \"The Canvas consortium has rejected the opportunity to incorporate Canvas into the Virgin Media customer experience, insisting that if we want to use their standards we must also accept that the entire Virgin Media entertainment service be accessed by our subscribers via a Canvas-imposed interface, including the Canvas channel listing and search facility. This \"shop window\" to services would be entirely controlled by the joint venture partners and would allow the Canvas partners to give preference and prominence to their own channel content above that of any other content provider. At this point, Canvas starts to look less like a set of genuinely \"open\" standards and more like a fully-fledged competing distribution platform from which established pay TV operators are effectively excluded, along with other innovative platforms offering a differentiated user experience, such as the PS3 and the Xbox. Unless we accept the Canvas consortium's conditions, people who want both Canvas and a pay TV service will have to buy two set-top boxes. Far from simplifying the digital world, Canvas will complicate it.\" On the BBC's involvement Berkett said: \"Quite rightly, much attention has been focused on whether the BBC should be using the licence fee to bank-roll such a controversial intervention in a dynamic market. And it's true that many private sector companies are already investing precious capital in \"connected TV\". But it's the closed nature of the Canvas platform which gives the BBC's involvement significance. A set of standards that are genuinely open to all and to which the BBC has contributed is one thing. A proprietary gateway to the digital world, underpinned by the formidable brand and marketing muscle of the BBC, is quite another.\"\n\nOn 5 March 2010, in a Q&A session at the DTG Summit, Richard Halton, then programme director for Project Canvas, faced criticism from Digital TV Group members about the lack of published technical specifications for the platform. In response, he asked members to appreciate the \"tough and pretty challenging\" schedule exerted on the project. However, Halton acknowledged the DTG's desire for more effective engagement with Canvas, and committed to publishing the remaining key technical documents by the end of May.<ref name=\"DTG Summit 2010\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/digitaltv/news/a207091/canvas-director-faces-dtg-grilling.html|title=Canvas director faces DTG grilling|publisher=Digital Spy|date=5 March 2010}}</ref>\n\nOn 19 April 2010, 3view managing director John Donovan has said that he is \"concerned\" about the potential market impact of IPTV joint venture Project Canvas.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/digitaltv/news/a215143/3view-md-concerned-by-project-canvas.html|title=3view MD 'concerned by Project Canvas'|publisher=Digital Spy|date=19 April 2010}}</ref> \"The honest answer is that no-one has spoken to me from the BBC about what Canvas will entail. We do not understand what Canvas's remit will be and we do not subscribe to the belief that Canvas will provide something the commercial market can't. We have proved that we can do it,\" he told [[Digital Spy]]. Donovan declined to be drawn on whether 3view would consider a legal challenge to Canvas, but did say that his business will defend its ability to compete in the market. \"I think we would have to reserve comment [on possible legal action]. But at this stage, clearly, we will protect our business at all costs. And I think, we will just have to leave it there for the moment.\"\n\n===Office of Fair Trading approval===\nOn 22 March 2010, the Project Canvas partners submitted analysis to the [[Office of Fair Trading]] setting out why the proposed Canvas joint venture does not constitute a qualifying merger under the [[Enterprise Act 2002]].<ref name=\"Arqiva OFT\" /> On 19 May 2010, the OFT confirmed that it would not investigate Project Canvas over competition issues.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2010/may/19/oft-project-canvas|title=OFT clears Project Canvas|work=The Guardian|date=19 May 2010 | location=London | first=Mark | last=Sweney | accessdate=22 May 2010}}</ref> As none of the partners were contributing a \"pre-existing business\" to Project Canvas, the OFT ruled that it \"did not have the jurisdiction\" to investigate the venture on competition grounds. \"Unlike in the Project Kangaroo joint venture which was blocked by the Competition Commission in 2009, it is not proposed that the joint venture partners will contribute any video-on-demand content or other business to [Project] Canvas, and Canvas will have no role in aggregating, marketing or directly retailing any such television content,\" said the OFT. The OFT also said that it found that none of the partners would have a \"material influence\" over the policy of the venture \u2013 the \"lowest level of control that may give rise to a relevant merger situation\".\n\n===Ofcom approval===\nOn 3 August 2010, Virgin Media lodged a complaint with [[Ofcom]] claiming that Project Canvas is an anti-competitive cartel that will crush the nascent online TV market.<ref name=\"Virgin Ofcom\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2010/aug/03/project-canvas-virgin-media-ofcom|title=Virgin Media aims to block Project Canvas with Ofcom complaint|work=The Guardian|date=3 August 2010 | location=London | first=Mark | last=Sweney | accessdate=3 August 2010}}</ref> The cable TV company, which is also calling on the Office of Fair Trading to step in on the grounds that the venture breaches the Competition Act, argues that the six partners backing Project Canvas have not stuck to their stated pledge of creating a set of open standards for delivering next-generation TV services. \"Collectively the BBC, ITV and Channel 4 account for around two-thirds of all television viewing in the UK while BT and TalkTalk control over half the national broadband market,\" said Virgin Media. \"[Project Canvas] will stifle future innovation as well as eliminate existing consumer choice for home entertainment. These well-resourced companies usually are direct competitors in their respective markets but... they are establishing a single new TV platform of their own with a considerable incentive to favour this over other TV services. This could severely affect consumer options for watching public service programming in the future.\"\n\nVirgin Media has also complained that Project Canvas has wrongly rejected what the company considers fair offers of integrating the technology into its own set-top boxes with a compromise on user interface. \"We have not taken the decision to file this complaint lightly,\" said a Virgin Media spokesman. \"However, the Canvas partners have significantly exceeded their original claims to be creating a common set of open standards which could have been improved upon by others and are now intent on controlling every aspect of how people watch television.\"<ref name=\"Virgin Ofcom\" />\n\nOn 18 August 2010, [[IP Vision]] formally complained to Ofcom, calling on the regulator to examine the impact Project Canvas will have on innovation, competition and consumer choice.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.broadbandtvnews.com/2010/08/18/ip-vision-says-canvas-is-bad-news-for-consumers/|title=IP Vision says Canvas is bad news for consumers|publisher=Broadband TV News|date=18 August 2010}}</ref> IP Vision is challenging the validity of Project Canvas, under the 1998 Competition Act. The company has already challenged the BBC over support for [[BBC iPlayer]].\n\nOn 30 August 2010, [[Six TV]], the largest holder of analogue television [[restricted service licence]]s in the UK (none of which are in use), announced that it would formally request a full Ofcom investigation of Canvas, warning that it could be a \"poison pill\" for regional broadcasters.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2010/aug/30/six-tv-bbc-freeview-ofcom|title=Local TV group to complain to Ofcom over BBC-Canvas joint venture|work=The Guardian|date=30 August 2010 | location=London | first=Richard | last=Wray | accessdate=30 August 2010}}</ref> Six TV will also submit its complaint regarding Canvas \u2013 which includes broader concerns regarding anti-competitive practices affecting digital television transmission in the UK \u2013 to the Office of Fair Trading. Six TV also intends to lobby communications minister [[Ed Vaizey]].

Wootton also claimed that the BBC Trust's recent consultation on Canvas/YouView was \"insufficient\" for a platform that would carry advertising.\n\nOn 28 September 2010, Electra Entertainment \u2013 a UK-based IPTV service provider, complained to media regulator Ofcom that YouView will \"damage\" the UK's interactive TV sector.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/digitaltv/news/a279117/ofcom-receives-another-youview-complaint.html|title=Ofcom receives another YouView complaint|publisher=Digital Spy|date=28 September 2010}}</ref> Electra has developed an IPTV platform, called Trove, which brings rich media services to the TV screen. It is currently available on Tesco-branded Freeview set top boxes. Electra believes that \"the proposed vision, shareholder structure and aims of YouView are anti-competitive and significantly damage the UK interactive TV market\". The firm also claimed that YouView's estimated initial marketing budget of \u00a348 million is a \"major cause for concern amongst venture capitalists looking to fund competing private British businesses in this emerging broadband TV sector\".\n\nOn 13 October 2010, British Sky Broadcasting submitted a last-minute complaint to Ofcom and the Office of Fair Trading.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2010/oct/13/bskyb-complaint-youview-ofcom|title=BSkyB submits 11th-hour complaint to Ofcom and OFT in bid to halt YouView|work=The Guardian|date=13 October 2010 | location=London | first=Mark | last=Sweeney | accessdate=13 October 2010}}</ref> The media regulator is now likely to delay a decision on whether to launch a full investigation into the service, previously called Project Canvas, while it considers Sky's objection. News of Sky's move prompted an angry reaction from the YouView chief executive, Richard Halton, \"While we welcome justifiable scrutiny, the timing of this submission is clearly designed to extend the regulatory process in pursuit of commercial self-interest rather than the public interest\", he said. Sky is believed to argue in its submission that the seven-partner YouView venture will stifle competition in the on-demand market.\n\nOn 19 October 2010, Ofcom announced that it will not open an investigation into Project Canvas (YouView) under the Competition Act following complaints made by Virgin Media and IPVision.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://media.ofcom.org.uk/2010/10/19/no-investigation-into-project-canvas/|title=No investigation into Project Canvas|publisher=Ofcom|date=19 October 2010}}</ref> Ofcom also received submissions from 11 other parties, including BSkyB.\n\nThe regulator said that it is \"premature\" to open an investigation into YouView, as \"whether or not YouView and its partners will harm competition in the ways alleged will depend upon how this emerging market develops and how they act, particularly in relation to providing access to content and issuing technical standards\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/digitaltv/news/a282888/ofcom-rules-out-youview-investigation.html|title=Ofcom rules out YouView investigation|publisher=Digital Spy|date=19 October 2010}}</ref> Ofcom noted that there is \"little evidence\" at this stage that YouView partners the BBC, ITV, Channel 4 and Channel 5 plan to restrict access to their video on-demand content.\n\nOfcom do not propose to open a Competition Act investigation, however Ofcom will continue to monitor developments, particularly in relation to YouView's approach to sharing standards and its effects on content syndication.

It was formed from a project originally titled ''Project Canvas'', which was rebranded as YouView in September 2010. The service was due to launch by the end of that year, but was delayed until 4 July 2012. At its launch, YouView's chairman [[Alan Sugar]] stated his ambition for the service to replace [[Freeview (UK)|Freeview]] devices.\n\nYouView provides access to free-to-air [[digital terrestrial television]] (DTT) channels (both DVB-T and [[DVB-T2]] channels in common with the [[Freeview (UK)|Freeview]] television platform) and to [[TV on demand]] (catch-up TV) services via a 'hybrid' [[set-top box]] (STB) purchased by users, connected with both a [[Internet access#Broadband access|broadband internet connection]] ''and'' a normal [[television aerial]]. No contract is required, and there is no subscription charge. Catch-up and on-demand content is delivered over the internet, which may be chargeable by the [[Internet service provider]] (ISP), or subject to limits and [[fair usage clause]]s.\n\n[[BT Group|BT]] and [[TalkTalk Group|TalkTalk]] have each partnered with YouView, allowing BT subsidiaries [[BT TV]] and [[Plusnet]]'s 'YouView TV from Plusnet' service, and [[TalkTalk TV]] customers to access the service, along with BT's and TalkTalk's own offerings. Both companies provide customers with their own branded YouView set-top box.\n\n==YouView content==\nThe YouView hardware is a [[digital terrestrial television]] [[DVB-T2]] HD set-top box that provides viewing and recording of all free-to-air channels available on [[digital terrestrial television in the United Kingdom]].  There is no access to some streamed channels in the 225\u2013256 range on [[Freeview (UK)|Freeview]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.a516digital.com/p/youview-channel-listing.html|title=YouView channel list \u2013 BT TV, TalkTalk TV, Plusnet TV|website=a516digital}}</ref> as YouView lacks support for the [[MHEG-5]] integration channel used by these channels to provide them over IP.{{clarify|date=October 2017}}\n\nAdditional content is provided over a broadband internet connection, with channels that can be viewed and recorded in the same way as the free-to-air channels and can also be accessed via the YouView menu and [[EPG]] via the search function.\n\nThere are{{when|date=October 2017}}<!--use the template {{as of|YYYY|MM|df=y|lc=y}}--> ten free catch up TV players available, providing access to TV programming and movies: [[BBC iPlayer]], [[ITV Hub]], [[All 4]], [[My5]], [[STV Player]], [[Milkshake!]], [[UKTV Play]], [[S4C]], POP FUN and [[Quest (TV channel)|Quest]]. The content on ITV Hub varies by region. STV Player is only available in [[STV Group (Scotland)|STV Group]] regions.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.youview.com/entertainment/|title=Entertainment \u2013 YouView|work=YouView|access-date=8 April 2018|language=en-GB}}</ref>\n\nThere are an additional three pay TV [[Video on demand|on-demand]] players: [[Netflix]], [[Now TV (Sky plc)|Now TV]], and [[Sky Store]] from [[Sky (United Kingdom)|Sky]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.youview.com/whats-on/#Catchup|title=Home \u2013 YouView|website=YouView}}</ref>\n\n===YouView from BT===\n{{Main|BT TV}}\n[[BT Infinity]] subscribers can access additional live [[IPTV]] channels via the EPG. Customers who subscribe to BT TV will receive either a YouView+ (YouView plus) box (with recording capabilities), or a standard YouView box (no recording capabilities), or a YouView [[Ultra-high-definition television|Ultra HD]] box \u2013 depending on the subscription type taken.  They can then view on-demand content through the BT TV Player.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.shop.bt.com/category/electronics,tv-and-home-entertainment,digiboxes-and-recorders/11225|title=Digiboxes, BT YouView & Freeview Recorders \u2013 BT Shop|website=www.shop.bt.com}}</ref>\n\n===YouView from Plusnet===\nPlusnet 'Unlimited Fibre' customers can subscribe to Plusnet's 'YouView TV from Plusnet' service, with provision through both the full range of available Freeview channels and by channels live-streamed through the Internet (IPTV), in both Standard Definition and High Definition. Subscribers choose either a standard YouView box or YouView+ box, the latter with the ability to pause and rewind live TV, and a recording capacity of up to 150 hours of HD, or 300 hours of SD Freeview, Entertainment and BT Sport Lite channels, which are included as standard. Both boxes also provide access to the 'on demand' players from the main broadcasters: BBC iPlayer, the ITV Hub, All 4 and My 5.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.plus.net/tv/|title=YouView TV from Plusnet|work=Plusnet|accessdate=12 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n===YouView from TalkTalk===\n{{Main|TalkTalk TV}}\nA free YouView box is provided to TalkTalk Plus or Essentials customers taking out a fixed term contract and allow access to the content previously available from TalkTalk TV.  Content that TalkTalk provides, such as film rentals and box sets, are available from the TalkTalk Player [[application software|application]] within the YouView menu bar.  In the TalkTalk Player, there are 'boosts' that customers can buy for a minimum of one month, and customers can watch and record them from the main guide the same as Freeview channels.  These boosts range from Sky premium channels, sports, TV box sets, films, and foreign language channels.  TalkTalk use their own brand of [[Huawei]]-manufactured boxes, with the TalkTalk logo on the front, a remote control with a direct button on the TalkTalk Player, and a 320&nbsp;[[Gigabyte|GB]] hard drive for Plus TV customers.  Essentials customers cannot record, but can still pause live TV.  Unlike BT, customers do not need a fibre broadband package to access the service.\n\n===Expand to other platforms===\nOn 29 July 2013 it was revealed that the YouView partners intended to launch the service on [[smartphone]]s, [[tablet computer|tablets]], and [[smart TV]]s, three days after [[BSkyB]] announced the \u00a310 [[Now TV (Sky plc)|Now TV]] set-top box which streams on demand content.<ref>https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/news/10209196/YouView-to-launch-on-tablets-and-smart-TVs.html YouView to launch on tablets and smart TVs</ref>\n\n==History==\n'''''Project Canvas''''' was initially announced on 11 December 2008 as a partnership between the BBC, BT and ITV plc.  It followed the failure of [[Kangaroo (video on demand)|Project Kangaroo]], a proposed video-on-demand service offering content from [[BBC Worldwide]], [[ITV.com]], and Channel 4's 4oD, which was blocked on competition grounds, and ended up as the [[SeeSaw (Internet television)|SeeSaw]] internet television service.  Project Canvas differed from Kangaroo, however, in that it was a proposed TV platform (a device that would deliver internet-connected TV), rather than a video-on-demand service (that would act as a single content portal, much like the music video equivalent [[VEVO]]).\n\nOn 30 July 2009, Project Canvas announced that Five had signed up to the project.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ProjectCanvas.info/index.cfm/news/?mode=alias&alias=First-Developer-Article|title=Five enters canvas partnership|website=ProjectCanvas.info|publisher=Project Canvas|date=30 July 2009}}</ref> On 9 July 2010, Five announced that it would not pursue further involvement in Project Canvas, pending a review of its digital investment strategy.  Charles Constable, Director of Strategy at Five said: \"We continue to support the objectives of Project Canvas, and despite withdrawing our interest in the venture we believe it will be a critical part of our strategy for reaching consumers in the future.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ProjectCanvas.info/index.cfm/news/?mode=alias&alias=Project-Canvas-moves-forward-as-Five-departs|title=Project Canvas moves forward as Five departs|website=ProjectCanvas.info|publisher=Project Canvas|date=9 July 2010}}</ref> On 24 August 2010, Five re-joined Project Canvas, following their acquisition by [[Northern & Shell]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ProjectCanvas.info/index.cfm/news/?mode=alias&alias=Five-comes-back-to-Project-Canvas|title=Five comes back to Project Canvas|website=ProjectCanvas.info|publisher=Project Canvas|date=24 August 2010}}</ref>\n\nOn 16 December 2009, Project Canvas announced that Channel 4 and TalkTalk had also signed up to the project.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ProjectCanvas.info/index.cfm/news/?mode=alias&alias=Channel-4-and-Talk-Talk-join-Project-Canvas--Six-partners-invite-expressions-of-interest|title=Channel 4 and Talk Talk join Project Canvas \u2013 Six partners invite 'expressions of interest'|website=ProjectCanvas.info|publisher=Project Canvas|date=16 December 2009}}</ref>\n\nThe six partners invited any further expressions of interest from companies interested in becoming part of the joint venture.

on Project Canvas, the [[Digital TV Group]] said that there is \"widespread concern\" that the venture's partners are developing critical technology standards that do not involve key players such as set top-box manufacturers and TV makers.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2010/feb/04/project-canvas-digital-tv-group|title=TV makers and retailers voice concerns over Project Canvas|work=The Guardian|date=4 February 2010 | location=London | first=Mark | last=Sweney | accessdate=22 May 2010}}</ref> The DTG argue that the BBC Trust's provisional approval document does not contain a \"clear and unequivocal condition\" that Project Canvas will have to work with industry and there appears to be a \"parallel process\" taking place where Project Canvas and its preferred technology partners are developing a separate standard.\n\n[[Morgan Stanley]] compiled a creative analysis for BT about the potential impact of Canvas, describing it as \"[[Freeview (UK)|Freeview]] 2.0\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/digitaltv/news/a203561/report-canvas-will-be-freeview-20.html|title=Report: 'Canvas will be Freeview 2.0'|publisher=Digital Spy|date=16 February 2010}}</ref> Morgan Stanley noted that the BBC Trust will reach a final decision on the BBC's Canvas involvement at the end of March. If it gives the full green light, then the platform could enter launch phase by the end of the year or in early 2011. However, Morgan Stanley noted that any launch date would be dependent on the completion of major technical work, such as locking down specifications with manufacturers and also creating a workable electronic programming guide. Morgan Stanley expects that Canvas set-top boxes will cost between \u00a3150 and \u00a3200. The report predicts that an [[App Store (iOS)|App Store]]-style resource could be introduced to Canvas in the future, along with the integration of social networks such as [[Twitter]]. As Canvas will be an open platform, the report noted that content providers would no longer need to pay the current sum of around \u00a310m for capacity on [[digital terrestrial television]] to reach their target audience. Internet service providers would also benefit from the service due an increased consumer demand for fixed broadband packages, along with greater opportunities to sell more expensive tariffs for high definition streaming. Storing popular programmes on local Canvas drives would also ease the burden of heavy streaming traffic over broadband networks. Considering outstanding issues facing the project, Morgan Stanley said: \"Canvas looks pro-competitive (breaking down platform barriers for content owners), but some media companies could still try to challenge its creation. \"It looks unlikely that this could freeze launch however as content is not being aggregated and the BBC shareholding will be only 16.6%.\"\n\nOn 4 March 2010, ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' learned that Neil Berkett, [[Virgin Media]]'s chief executive, would tell the Cable Congress in Brussels \"the BBC Trust's consultation has been a shameless whitewash that contravenes almost every principle of good regulation.\"<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/mediatechnologyandtelecoms/media/7362359/Virgin-Media-attacks-BBC-Trust-over-Project-Canvas.html|title=Virgin Media attacks BBC Trust over Project Canvas|work=The Daily Telegraph|date=4 March 2010 | location=London | first=Rupert | last=Neate | accessdate=22 May 2010}}</ref> Mr Berkett objects to proposals to force all broadcasters to use a single 'Project Canvas' brand controlled by the BBC and its partners, which he claims will penalise commercial rivals. \"The BBC Trust has stubbornly ignored all requests to address our concerns by imposing safeguards to prevent the BBC emerging as de facto gatekeeper of the digital world. This is a blatant demonstration that the Trust is incapable of regulating the BBC's activities in an objective way.\" On 28 April 2010, Neil Berkett confirmed that Virgin Media had made a submission to the Office of Fair Trading over Project Canvas.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2010/apr/28/virgin-media-sky-sports|title=Virgin Media eyes HD as it battles Sky for lower sports charges|work=The Guardian|date=28 April 2010 | location=London | first=Mark | last=Sweney | accessdate=22 May 2010}}</ref> \"Canvas needs to be an open platform but it is closed and will require a [second] dedicated set-top box,\" said Berkett. \"We will oppose it vigorously if it is not an open world at large for customers to take advantage of. [The current proposals] are asking pay-TV customers to buy a second set-top box.\" He added that he considered it a misuse of the licence fee to create a product that was not accessible to all the public. \"It is funded by the BBC licence fee and should be available everywhere, on a Virgin Box, a PS3 and even a Sky box,\" he said. \"I find it extraordinary that it looks like the BBC Trust is endorsing what is a closed product. It is inappropriate for the BBC to be doing this.\"\n\nOn 14 June 2010, Neil Berkett revealed to The Guardian that \"Far from trying to block the development of these open standards, we have offered to work commercially with Canvas to explore mutually beneficial ways in which we could incorporate them as a self-contained service in the next generation of Virgin Media set-top boxes.\"<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/organgrinder/2010/jun/14/project-canvas-neil-berkett|title=Neil Berkett: why Virgin Media wants to work with Project Canvas|work=The Guardian|date=14 June 2010 | location=London | first=Neil | last=Berkett | accessdate=14 June 2010}}</ref> Berkett went on to explain his opposition to the project; \"The Canvas consortium has rejected the opportunity to incorporate Canvas into the Virgin Media customer experience, insisting that if we want to use their standards we must also accept that the entire Virgin Media entertainment service be accessed by our subscribers via a Canvas-imposed interface, including the Canvas channel listing and search facility. This \"shop window\" to services would be entirely controlled by the joint venture partners and would allow the Canvas partners to give preference and prominence to their own channel content above that of any other content provider. At this point, Canvas starts to look less like a set of genuinely \"open\" standards and more like a fully-fledged competing distribution platform from which established pay TV operators are effectively excluded, along with other innovative platforms offering a differentiated user experience, such as the PS3 and the Xbox. Unless we accept the Canvas consortium's conditions, people who want both Canvas and a pay TV service will have to buy two set-top boxes. Far from simplifying the digital world, Canvas will complicate it.\" On the BBC's involvement Berkett said: \"Quite rightly, much attention has been focused on whether the BBC should be using the licence fee to bank-roll such a controversial intervention in a dynamic market. And it's true that many private sector companies are already investing precious capital in \"connected TV\". But it's the closed nature of the Canvas platform which gives the BBC's involvement significance. A set of standards that are genuinely open to all and to which the BBC has contributed is one thing. A proprietary gateway to the digital world, underpinned by the formidable brand and marketing muscle of the BBC, is quite another.\"\n\nOn 5 March 2010, in a Q&A session at the DTG Summit, Richard Halton, then programme director for Project Canvas, faced criticism from Digital TV Group members about the lack of published technical specifications for the platform. In response, he asked members to appreciate the \"tough and pretty challenging\" schedule exerted on the project. However, Halton acknowledged the DTG's desire for more effective engagement with Canvas, and committed to publishing the remaining key technical documents by the end of May.<ref name=\"DTG Summit 2010\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/digitaltv/news/a207091/canvas-director-faces-dtg-grilling.html|title=Canvas director faces DTG grilling|publisher=Digital Spy|date=5 March 2010}}</ref>\n\nOn 19 April 2010, 3view managing director John Donovan has said that he is \"concerned\" about the potential market impact of IPTV joint venture Project Canvas.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/digitaltv/news/a215143/3view-md-concerned-by-project-canvas.html|title=3view MD 'concerned by Project Canvas'|publisher=Digital Spy|date=19 April 2010}}</ref> \"The honest answer is that no-one has spoken to me from the BBC about what Canvas will entail. We do not understand what Canvas's remit will be and we do not subscribe to the belief that Canvas will provide something the commercial market can't. We have proved that we can do it,\" he told [[Digital Spy]]. Donovan declined to be drawn on whether 3view would consider a legal challenge to Canvas, but did say that his business will defend its ability to compete in the market. \"I think we would have to reserve comment [on possible legal action]. But at this stage, clearly, we will protect our business at all costs. And I think, we will just have to leave it there for the moment.\"\n\n===Office of Fair Trading approval===\nOn 22 March 2010, the Project Canvas partners submitted analysis to the [[Office of Fair Trading]] setting out why the proposed Canvas joint venture does not constitute a qualifying merger under the [[Enterprise Act 2002]].<ref name=\"Arqiva OFT\" /> On 19 May 2010, the OFT confirmed that it would not investigate Project Canvas over competition issues.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2010/may/19/oft-project-canvas|title=OFT clears Project Canvas|work=The Guardian|date=19 May 2010 | location=London | first=Mark | last=Sweney | accessdate=22 May 2010}}</ref> As none of the partners were contributing a \"pre-existing business\" to Project Canvas, the OFT ruled that it \"did not have the jurisdiction\" to investigate the venture on competition grounds. \"Unlike in the Project Kangaroo joint venture which was blocked by the Competition Commission in 2009, it is not proposed that the joint venture partners will contribute any video-on-demand content or other business to [Project] Canvas, and Canvas will have no role in aggregating, marketing or directly retailing any such television content,\" said the OFT. The OFT also said that it found that none of the partners would have a \"material influence\" over the policy of the venture \u2013 the \"lowest level of control that may give rise to a relevant merger situation\".\n\n===Ofcom approval===\nOn 3 August 2010, Virgin Media lodged a complaint with [[Ofcom]] claiming that Project Canvas is an anti-competitive cartel that will crush the nascent online TV market.<ref name=\"Virgin Ofcom\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2010/aug/03/project-canvas-virgin-media-ofcom|title=Virgin Media aims to block Project Canvas with Ofcom complaint|work=The Guardian|date=3 August 2010 | location=London | first=Mark | last=Sweney | accessdate=3 August 2010}}</ref> The cable TV company, which is also calling on the Office of Fair Trading to step in on the grounds that the venture breaches the Competition Act, argues that the six partners backing Project Canvas have not stuck to their stated pledge of creating a set of open standards for delivering next-generation TV services. \"Collectively the BBC, ITV and Channel 4 account for around two-thirds of all television viewing in the UK while BT and TalkTalk control over half the national broadband market,\" said Virgin Media. \"[Project Canvas] will stifle future innovation as well as eliminate existing consumer choice for home entertainment. These well-resourced companies usually are direct competitors in their respective markets but... they are establishing a single new TV platform of their own with a considerable incentive to favour this over other TV services. This could severely affect consumer options for watching public service programming in the future.\"\n\nVirgin Media has also complained that Project Canvas has wrongly rejected what the company considers fair offers of integrating the technology into its own set-top boxes with a compromise on user interface. \"We have not taken the decision to file this complaint lightly,\" said a Virgin Media spokesman. \"However, the Canvas partners have significantly exceeded their original claims to be creating a common set of open standards which could have been improved upon by others and are now intent on controlling every aspect of how people watch television.\"<ref name=\"Virgin Ofcom\" />\n\nOn 18 August 2010, [[IP Vision]] formally complained to Ofcom, calling on the regulator to examine the impact Project Canvas will have on innovation, competition and consumer choice.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.broadbandtvnews.com/2010/08/18/ip-vision-says-canvas-is-bad-news-for-consumers/|title=IP Vision says Canvas is bad news for consumers|publisher=Broadband TV News|date=18 August 2010}}</ref> IP Vision is challenging the validity of Project Canvas, under the 1998 Competition Act. The company has already challenged the BBC over support for [[BBC iPlayer]].\n\nOn 30 August 2010, [[Six TV]], the largest holder of analogue television [[restricted service licence]]s in the UK (none of which are in use), announced that it would formally request a full Ofcom investigation of Canvas, warning that it could be a \"poison pill\" for regional broadcasters.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2010/aug/30/six-tv-bbc-freeview-ofcom|title=Local TV group to complain to Ofcom over BBC-Canvas joint venture|work=The Guardian|date=30 August 2010 | location=London | first=Richard | last=Wray | accessdate=30 August 2010}}</ref> Six TV will also submit its complaint regarding Canvas \u2013 which includes broader concerns regarding anti-competitive practices affecting digital television transmission in the UK \u2013 to the Office of Fair Trading. Six TV also intends to lobby communications minister [[Ed Vaizey]].

Wootton also claimed that the BBC Trust's recent consultation on Canvas/YouView was \"insufficient\" for a platform that would carry advertising.\n\nOn 28 September 2010, Electra Entertainment \u2013 a UK-based IPTV service provider, complained to media regulator Ofcom that YouView will \"damage\" the UK's interactive TV sector.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/digitaltv/news/a279117/ofcom-receives-another-youview-complaint.html|title=Ofcom receives another YouView complaint|publisher=Digital Spy|date=28 September 2010}}</ref> Electra has developed an IPTV platform, called Trove, which brings rich media services to the TV screen. It is currently available on Tesco-branded Freeview set top boxes. Electra believes that \"the proposed vision, shareholder structure and aims of YouView are anti-competitive and significantly damage the UK interactive TV market\". The firm also claimed that YouView's estimated initial marketing budget of \u00a348 million is a \"major cause for concern amongst venture capitalists looking to fund competing private British businesses in this emerging broadband TV sector\".\n\nOn 13 October 2010, British Sky Broadcasting submitted a last-minute complaint to Ofcom and the Office of Fair Trading.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2010/oct/13/bskyb-complaint-youview-ofcom|title=BSkyB submits 11th-hour complaint to Ofcom and OFT in bid to halt YouView|work=The Guardian|date=13 October 2010 | location=London | first=Mark | last=Sweeney | accessdate=13 October 2010}}</ref> The media regulator is now likely to delay a decision on whether to launch a full investigation into the service, previously called Project Canvas, while it considers Sky's objection. News of Sky's move prompted an angry reaction from the YouView chief executive, Richard Halton, \"While we welcome justifiable scrutiny, the timing of this submission is clearly designed to extend the regulatory process in pursuit of commercial self-interest rather than the public interest\", he said. Sky is believed to argue in its submission that the seven-partner YouView venture will stifle competition in the on-demand market.\n\nOn 19 October 2010, Ofcom announced that it will not open an investigation into Project Canvas (YouView) under the Competition Act following complaints made by Virgin Media and IPVision.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://media.ofcom.org.uk/2010/10/19/no-investigation-into-project-canvas/|title=No investigation into Project Canvas|publisher=Ofcom|date=19 October 2010}}</ref> Ofcom also received submissions from 11 other parties, including BSkyB.\n\nThe regulator said that it is \"premature\" to open an investigation into YouView, as \"whether or not YouView and its partners will harm competition in the ways alleged will depend upon how this emerging market develops and how they act, particularly in relation to providing access to content and issuing technical standards\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/digitaltv/news/a282888/ofcom-rules-out-youview-investigation.html|title=Ofcom rules out YouView investigation|publisher=Digital Spy|date=19 October 2010}}</ref> Ofcom noted that there is \"little evidence\" at this stage that YouView partners the BBC, ITV, Channel 4 and Channel 5 plan to restrict access to their video on-demand content.\n\nOfcom do not propose to open a Competition Act investigation, however Ofcom will continue to monitor developments, particularly in relation to YouView's approach to sharing standards and its effects on content syndication. If evidence emerges that the operation of YouView could cause harm to viewers and consumers in the future, Ofcom may reconsider whether to investigate.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Television|United Kingdom|Technology}}\n*[[Freeview (UK)#Freeview Play|Freeview Play]]\n*[[Kangaroo (video on demand)]]\n*[[Hybrid Broadcast Broadband TV]]\n*[[Smart TV]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|32em}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://www.YouView.com https://www.YouView.com] \u2014 official website\n\n{{BBC}}\n{{UK Based TV on demand}}\n{{Media in the United Kingdom|television}}\n\n[[Category:BT Group]]\n[[Category:TalkTalk Group]]\n[[Category:BBC New Media]]\n[[Category:ITV]]\n[[Category:Channel 4]]\n[[Category:Channel 5 (British TV channel)]]\n[[Category:Digital television]]\n[[Category:Internet television]]\n[[Category:Interactive television]]\n[[Category:Linux-based devices]]\n[[Category:Consumer electronics]]\n", "name_user": "Mcld", "label": "safe", "comment": "Category:Digital television in the United Kingdom", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouView"}

His family lived in a two-room HDB flat near the Woodbridge Hospital.

At Serangoon Gardens Secondary School, Fandi played for the school football team, but neglected his studies and was held back a year. He then transferred to the [[Institute of Technical Education|Singapore Vocational Institute]] and obtained a National Trade Certificate 3. He played for Kaki Bukit Football Club in the amateur National Football League, where he was spotted by Singapore FA coach [[Sebastian Yap]].<ref>Yeo, pp. 17\u201322</ref>\n\n==Club career==\nFandi joined Singapore FA in 1979 and became a regular midfield player, scoring four goals in his first Malaysia Cup season. The retirement of [[Arshad Khamis]] and [[Dollah Kassim]] prompted [[Jita Singh]], the new Singapore FA coach, to play Fandi as a striker. During the 1980 Malaysia Cup season, Fandi scored eight goals, including the winning goal in the final against [[Selangor FA]].<ref name=\"debut\">Yeo, pp. 23\u201327</ref> He enlisted for [[National Service in Singapore|National Service]] in September 1980 and was given light duties, such as collecting the camp garbage, so he could continue playing for Singapore FA. In 1981, Fandi won the [[Football Association of Singapore|FAS]] Footballer of the Year award for helping Singapore FA reach the Malaysia Cup final.<ref name=\"mile\"/> The following year, Singapore FA did not play in the Malaysia Cup for political reasons, and Fandi underwent a shoulder operation; he could not play football for six weeks and was discharged early from National Service.<ref>Yeo, pp. 31\u201334</ref>\n\nSelangor FA invited Fandi to play for them against Argentine club [[Boca Juniors]] in a friendly game, in which Fandi scored the only goal for Selangor FA; the score was 2\u20131. Fandi received offers from several Malaysia Cup teams, Indonesian side [[Niac Mitra]], Swiss club [[BSC Young Boys|Young Boys]] and Dutch side [[AFC Ajax|Ajax]]. After a three-week trial, Ajax offered Fandi a three-year contract,<ref name=\"ajaxoval\">Yeo, pp. 35\u201341</ref> but Fandi instead signed a one-year contract with Niac Mitra, where he spent one season, helped them successfully defend their [[Galatama|Galatama League]] title and was the third-highest scorer with 13 goals. In a friendly match between Niac Mitra and [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]], Fandi scored a goal in a 2\u20130 victory; however, he left Niac Mitra due to a sudden Galatama League ban on foreign players.<ref>Yeo, pp. 46\u201349</ref>\n\nIn 1983, Fandi moved to the Netherlands and signed a two-year contract with [[FC Groningen]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/straitstimes19830711-1.2.140 | title=Fandi goes Dutch | accessdate=18 July 2019}}</ref> A thigh injury acquired in a friendly match kept him off the field for ten weeks, but in his first [[Eredivisie]] game he scored twice in a 2\u20130 victory over [[Go Ahead Eagles]].

Fandi also played in the inaugural [[1996 Tiger Cup|Tiger Cup]], and scored an equaliser against Malaysia, a goal against Brunei and two against the Philippines. 1997 was a disappointing year for Fandi, who failed to score in the [[1997 Dunhill Cup Malaysia|Dunhill Cup]] and the World Cup qualifiers.

His family lived in a two-room HDB flat near the Woodbridge Hospital. They were not rich; Fandi had to sell [[nasi lemak]] to help support the family.<ref name=\"sacred\"/><ref name=\"star\">Murray Hiebert, \"Singapore's soccer star takes a shine to business\", ''Far Eastern Economic Review'', 17 April 1997.</ref> Fandi's father, [[Ahmad Wartam]] was then a goalkeeper for the national team.<ref name=\"mile\">\"Fandi Ahmad's milestones\", ''The Sunday Times'', 12 November 2006.</ref> Fandi started playing as a goalkeeper, but was advised by a teacher to switch to midfield.<ref>Yeo, pp. 9\u201316</ref> When he was 12, his parents divorced, after which he lived with his father and paternal grandparents. At Serangoon Gardens Secondary School, Fandi played for the school football team, but neglected his studies and was  held back a year. He then transferred to the [[Institute of Technical Education|Singapore Vocational Institute]] and obtained a National Trade Certificate 3. He played for Kaki Bukit Football Club in the amateur National Football League, where he was spotted by Singapore FA coach [[Sebastian Yap]].<ref>Yeo, pp. 17\u201322</ref>\n\n==Club career==\nFandi joined Singapore FA in 1979 and became a regular midfield player, scoring four goals in his first Malaysia Cup season. The retirement of [[Arshad Khamis]] and [[Dollah Kassim]] prompted [[Jita Singh]], the new Singapore FA coach, to play Fandi as a striker. During the 1980 Malaysia Cup season, Fandi scored eight goals, including the winning goal in the final against [[Selangor FA]].<ref name=\"debut\">Yeo, pp. 23\u201327</ref> He enlisted for [[National Service in Singapore|National Service]] in September 1980 and was given light duties, such as collecting the camp garbage, so he could continue playing for Singapore FA. In 1981, Fandi won the [[Football Association of Singapore|FAS]] Footballer of the Year award for helping Singapore FA reach the Malaysia Cup final.<ref name=\"mile\"/> The following year, Singapore FA did not play in the Malaysia Cup for political reasons, and Fandi underwent a shoulder operation; he could not play football for six weeks and was discharged early from National Service.<ref>Yeo, pp. 31\u201334</ref>\n\nSelangor FA invited Fandi to play for them against Argentine club [[Boca Juniors]] in a friendly game, in which Fandi scored the only goal for Selangor FA; the score was 2\u20131. Fandi received offers from several Malaysia Cup teams, Indonesian side [[Niac Mitra]], Swiss club [[BSC Young Boys|Young Boys]] and Dutch side [[AFC Ajax|Ajax]]. After a three-week trial, Ajax offered Fandi a three-year contract,<ref name=\"ajaxoval\">Yeo, pp. 35\u201341</ref> but Fandi instead signed a one-year contract with Niac Mitra, where he spent one season, helped them successfully defend their [[Galatama|Galatama League]] title and was the third-highest scorer with 13 goals. In a friendly match between Niac Mitra and [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]], Fandi scored a goal in a 2\u20130 victory; however, he left Niac Mitra due to a sudden Galatama League ban on foreign players.<ref>Yeo, pp. 46\u201349</ref>\n\nIn 1983, Fandi moved to the Netherlands and signed a two-year contract with [[FC Groningen]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/straitstimes19830711-1.2.140 | title=Fandi goes Dutch | accessdate=18 July 2019}}</ref> A thigh injury acquired in a friendly match kept him off the field for ten weeks, but in his first [[Eredivisie]] game he scored twice in a 2\u20130 victory over [[Go Ahead Eagles]].

However, problems with his International Transfer Certificate prevented him from playing for Crete, so he left Greece after two months.<ref>Yeo, pp. 106\u2013108</ref> Fandi then joined [[Pahang FA]], where he reverted to playing mainly in midfield due to his advancing age.<ref>Peter Khoo, \"Fandi hits full throttle in striker's role\", ''The Straits Times'', 16 December 1992.</ref> Fandi missed several months of games because of heel and thigh injuries, and scored three goals to help Pahang FA win the Malaysia Cup and [[Malaysian League]] [[Double (association football)|Double]] in 1992.<ref>\"Fading star Fandi up against rising star Farid\", ''The Straits Times'', 12 November 1992.</ref> That year, he  became the first Singaporean sportsperson to have career earnings exceeding a million Singapore dollars (not adjusted for inflation).<ref name=\"sacred\"/>\n\nFandi rejoined Singapore FA after it was relegated to the second tier of the Malaysian League.

Despite suffering an ankle injury in the 1\u20132 final defeat by Thailand,<ref>Yeo, pp. 50\u201353</ref> he played in the 1983 [[Merlion Cup]], and scored in a 1\u20130 semi-final win against of [[China national football team|China]].<ref name=\"aprmercup\"/> The second SEA Games silver medal came in [[1985 Southeast Asian Games|1985]], when Fandi scored against Malaysia and the Philippines in the group stage, then two goals against Brunei in the semi-final. At the [[1989 Southeast Asian Games|1989 SEA Games]], Fandi scored in the 4\u20130 victory over [[Myanmar national football team|Myanmar]] that took Singapore past the group stages, the last-minute winner in the semi-final against defending champions [[Indonesia national football team|Indonesia]] and Singapore's single goal in the 1\u20133 final defeat by Malaysia.
