Other terms used to refer to vehicle vinyl wrap are car wrap, paint wrap, color change wrap, vehicle graphics, and [[paint protection film]], A new method of manufactured wrap is called CSK method which has 30% more stretch and great bubble release.\n\n== History ==\nVehicle vinyl wrap and color change wraps grew in popularity out of the [[wrap advertising]] business. A large milestone in the shift from small production vinyl lettering to a full vehicle vinyl color change took place in Germany in 1993 when the vinyl manufacturer Kay Premium Marking Films (CSK) was asked to produce a film to be used in place of paint for the purpose of converting cars into taxis. At this time, German taxi companies were required by law to paint their fleets in a government mandated color, beige. KMPF provided an alternative to painting, which allowed taxi companies to bring a large fleet of vehicles into compliance with German law while maintaining the future resale value of the vehicle. Prior to this point, decommissioned taxis were heavily discounted or had to be completely repainted. With the use of vinyl vehicle wraps there was no need to repaint them or discount them as the vinyl could be removed without damaging the paint underneath. CSK documented after 3 years of taxi service was complete, the vinyl was removed leaving a pristine and unscratched paint surface.www.cskwraps.uk\n\nWrap installers that performed advertising vinyls, began to offer accent and full vinyl wraps as a cosmetic enhancement. Vehicle owners, correspondingly drove demand and requested vinyl wraps that suited their desires. Rather than advertise a company or brand, vehicle owners wanted to change the color and finish of their vehicle for cosmetic or protective purposes. Manufacturers of vinyl wrap followed this trend by producing more colors and easier to install, durable materials.\n\nOne of the earliest cosmetic vinyl treatments dates to the 1950s and an aftermarket product by Newhouse Automotive Industries of Los Angeles, California.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.autoblog.com/2013/11/27/car-d-cal-vehicle-wraps/|title=As it turns out, vehicle wraps are anything but new|website=Autoblog|access-date=2017-07-18}}</ref> Costs for DIY partial decorative (plaid or polka dot) vinyl treatments ranged from $10-$20.\n\nThe Newhouse Automotive ads described vinyl as \"very latest automotive sensation:\" vehicle wraps. The Newhouse ads began in 1954.\n\nBy 2017, color change vinyl wraps, paint color matching vinyl wraps, and overlaminates evolved to include complex and creative graphic designs and advanced colors. Metallic, chrome, color shifting and even vinyl wraps that match OEM paint code colors are available.\n\nColor Change and \"Paint Wrap\" is a term used by wrap installers and refers to a full-color change, as if one were 'painting' car with vinyl wrap. Demand for color matching vinyl wrap has grown. Wrap is manufactured to match vehicle paint colors and metallics, as well as in colors used in print such as Pantone colors.\n\n== Technologies ==\n\nCast Vinyl is the most common material used in color change wraps. A cast vinyl starts as a liquid and is cast into a sheet or form and then processed through ovens, evaporating solvents in the liquid. When the solvents evaporate, the remainder is a solid film usually between 2 mil (printable media) to 4 mil (solid color) thick.

The applications of percolation theory to [[materials science]] and other domains are discussed in the article [[percolation]].\n\n==Introduction==<!-- [[Bond percolation]] and [[Site percolation]] redirect to here -->\n[[File:perc-wiki.png|thumb|left|A three-dimensional site percolation graph]]\nThe [[Flory\u2013Stockmayer theory]] was the first theory investigating percolation processes.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Mw_csu3AcB0C&lpg=PA8&dq=Flory%E2%80%93Stockmayer%20theory%20percolation%20theory&pg=PA8#v=onepage&q=Flory%E2%80%93Stockmayer%20theory%20percolation%20theory&f=false|title=Applications Of Percolation Theory|last=Sahini|first=M.|last2=Sahimi|first2=M.|date=2003-07-13|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-0-203-22153-2|language=en}}</ref>\n\n\nA representative question (and the [[etymology|source]] of the name) is as follows. Assume that some liquid is poured on top of some [[porosity|porous]] material. Will the liquid be able to make its way from hole to hole and reach the bottom? This physical question is [[mathematical model|modelled]] mathematically as a [[Grid graph|three-dimensional network]] of {{math|''n'' \u00d7 ''n'' \u00d7 ''n''}} [[graph (discrete mathematics)|vertices]], usually called \"sites\", in which the [[graph (discrete mathematics)|edge]] or \"bonds\" between each two neighbors may be open (allowing the liquid through) with probability {{math|''p''}}, or closed with probability {{math|1 \u2013 ''p''}}, and they are assumed to be independent. Therefore, for a given {{math|''p''}}, what is the probability that an open path (meaning a path, each of whose links is an \"open\" bond) exists from the top to the bottom? The behavior for large&nbsp;{{math|''n''}} is of primary interest. This problem, called now '''bond percolation''', was introduced in the mathematics literature by {{harvtxt|Broadbent|Hammersley|1957}},<ref name=\"BroadbentHammersley2008\">{{cite journal|last1=Broadbent|first1=S. R.|last2=Hammersley|first2=J.

The question is the same: for a given ''p'', what is the probability that a path exists between top and bottom? Similarly, one can ask, given a connected graph at what fraction {{math|1 \u2013 ''p''}} of failures the graph will become disconnected (no large component).\n[[File:Tube Network Percolation.gif|thumb|A 3D tube network percolation determination]]\nThe same questions can be asked for any lattice dimension. As is quite typical, it is actually easier to examine [[Infinite graph|infinite]] networks than just large ones. In this case the corresponding question is: does an infinite open cluster exist? That is, is there a path of connected points of infinite length \"through\" the network?  By [[Kolmogorov's zero\u2013one law]], for any given {{math|''p''}}, the probability that an infinite cluster exists is either zero or one. Since this probability is an increasing function of {{math|''p''}} (proof via [[Coupling (probability)|coupling]] argument), there must be a '''critical''' {{math|''p''}} (denoted by&nbsp;{{math|''p''<sub>c</sub>}}) below which the probability is always 0 and above which the probability is always&nbsp;1. In practice, this criticality is very easy to observe. Even for {{math|''n''}} as small as 100, the probability of an open path from the top to the bottom increases sharply from very close to zero to very close to one in a short span of values of&nbsp;{{math|''p''}}.\n\n[[Image:Bond percolation p 51.png|thumb|Detail of a bond percolation on the square lattice in two dimensions with percolation probability {{math|''p'' {{=}} 0.51}}]]\n\nFor most infinite lattice graphs, {{math|''p''<sub>c</sub>}} cannot be calculated exactly, though in some cases {{math|''p''<sub>c</sub>}} there is an exact value.

This universality also means that for a given dimension, the various critical exponents, the [[fractal dimension]] of the clusters at {{math|''p''<sub>c</sub>}} is independent of the lattice type and percolation type (e.g., bond or site). However, recently percolation has been performed on a [[weighted planar stochastic lattice (WPSL)]] and found that although the dimension of the WPSL coincides with the dimension of the space where it is embedded, its universality class is different from that of all the known planar lattices.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Hassan | first1 = M.

That is, when {{math|''p'' < ''p''<sub>c</sub>}}, the probability that a specific point (for example, the origin) is contained in an open cluster (meaning a maximal connected set of \"open\" edges of the graph) of size {{math|''r''}} decays to zero [[Big O notation#Orders of common functions|exponentially]] in&nbsp;{{math|''r''}}. This was proved for percolation in three and more dimensions by {{harvtxt|Menshikov|1986}} and independently by {{harvtxt|Aizenman|Barsky|1987}}. In two dimensions, it formed part of Kesten's proof that {{math|''p''<sub>c</sub> {{=}} {{sfrac|1|2}}}}.<ref name=\"Kesten1982\">{{Cite book|last1=Kesten|first1=Harry|title=Percolation Theory for Mathematicians|year=1982|doi=10.1007/978-1-4899-2730-9|isbn=978-0-8176-3107-9}}</ref>\n\nThe [[dual graph]] of the square lattice {{math|'''\u2124'''<sup>2</sup>}} is also the square lattice. It follows that, in two dimensions, the supercritical phase is dual to a subcritical percolation process. This provides essentially full information about the supercritical model with {{math|''d'' {{=}} 2}}. The main result for the supercritical phase in three and more dimensions is that,  for sufficiently large&nbsp;{{math|''N''}}, there is{{clarify|reason=With probability one?|date=April 2016}} an infinite open cluster in the two-dimensional slab {{math|'''\u2124'''<sup>2</sup> \u00d7 [0, ''N'']<sup>''d'' \u2212 2</sup>}}.

Thus the subcritical phase may be described as finite open islands in an infinite closed ocean. When {{math|''p'' > {{sfrac|1|2}}}} just the opposite occurs, with finite closed islands in an infinite open ocean. The picture is more complicated when {{math|''d'' \u2265 3}} since {{math|''p''<sub>c</sub> < {{sfrac|1|2}}}}, and there is coexistence of infinite open and closed clusters for {{math|''p''}} between {{math|''p''<sub>c</sub>}} and&nbsp;{{math|1 \u2212 ''p''<sub>c</sub>}}.\n\n===Critical===\n\nThe model has a [[mathematical singularity|singularity]] at the critical point {{math|''p'' {{=}} ''p''<sub>c</sub>}} believed to be of power-law type.

When {{math|''d'' {{=}} 2}} these predictions are backed up by arguments from [[conformal field theory]] and [[Schramm\u2013Loewner evolution]], and include predicted numerical values for the exponents.

Assume that some liquid is poured on top of some [[porosity|porous]] material. Will the liquid be able to make its way from hole to hole and reach the bottom? This physical question is [[mathematical model|modelled]] mathematically as a [[Grid graph|three-dimensional network]] of {{math|''n'' \u00d7 ''n'' \u00d7 ''n''}} [[graph (discrete mathematics)|vertices]], usually called \"sites\", in which the [[graph (discrete mathematics)|edge]] or \"bonds\" between each two neighbors may be open (allowing the liquid through) with probability {{math|''p''}}, or closed with probability {{math|1 \u2013 ''p''}}, and they are assumed to be independent. Therefore, for a given {{math|''p''}}, what is the probability that an open path (meaning a path, each of whose links is an \"open\" bond) exists from the top to the bottom? The behavior for large&nbsp;{{math|''n''}} is of primary interest. This problem, called now '''bond percolation''', was introduced in the mathematics literature by {{harvtxt|Broadbent|Hammersley|1957}},<ref name=\"BroadbentHammersley2008\">{{cite journal|last1=Broadbent|first1=S.

The question is the same: for a given ''p'', what is the probability that a path exists between top and bottom? Similarly, one can ask, given a connected graph at what fraction {{math|1 \u2013 ''p''}} of failures the graph will become disconnected (no large component).\n[[File:Tube Network Percolation.gif|thumb|A 3D tube network percolation determination]]\nThe same questions can be asked for any lattice dimension. As is quite typical, it is actually easier to examine [[Infinite graph|infinite]] networks than just large ones. In this case the corresponding question is: does an infinite open cluster exist? That is, is there a path of connected points of infinite length \"through\" the network?  By [[Kolmogorov's zero\u2013one law]], for any given {{math|''p''}}, the probability that an infinite cluster exists is either zero or one. Since this probability is an increasing function of {{math|''p''}} (proof via [[Coupling (probability)|coupling]] argument), there must be a '''critical''' {{math|''p''}} (denoted by&nbsp;{{math|''p''<sub>c</sub>}}) below which the probability is always 0 and above which the probability is always&nbsp;1.

This universality also means that for a given dimension, the various critical exponents, the [[fractal dimension]] of the clusters at {{math|''p''<sub>c</sub>}} is independent of the lattice type and percolation type (e.g., bond or site). However, recently percolation has been performed on a [[weighted planar stochastic lattice (WPSL)]] and found that although the dimension of the WPSL coincides with the dimension of the space where it is embedded, its universality class is different from that of all the known planar lattices.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Hassan | first1 = M.

This was proved for percolation in three and more dimensions by {{harvtxt|Menshikov|1986}} and independently by {{harvtxt|Aizenman|Barsky|1987}}. In two dimensions, it formed part of Kesten's proof that {{math|''p''<sub>c</sub> {{=}} {{sfrac|1|2}}}}.<ref name=\"Kesten1982\">{{Cite book|last1=Kesten|first1=Harry|title=Percolation Theory for Mathematicians|year=1982|doi=10.1007/978-1-4899-2730-9|isbn=978-0-8176-3107-9}}</ref>\n\nThe [[dual graph]] of the square lattice {{math|'''\u2124'''<sup>2</sup>}} is also the square lattice. It follows that, in two dimensions, the supercritical phase is dual to a subcritical percolation process. This provides essentially full information about the supercritical model with {{math|''d'' {{=}} 2}}. The main result for the supercritical phase in three and more dimensions is that,  for sufficiently large&nbsp;{{math|''N''}}, there is{{clarify|reason=With probability one?|date=April 2016}} an infinite open cluster in the two-dimensional slab {{math|'''\u2124'''<sup>2</sup> \u00d7 [0, ''N'']<sup>''d'' \u2212 2</sup>}}.

Thus the subcritical phase may be described as finite open islands in an infinite closed ocean. When {{math|''p'' > {{sfrac|1|2}}}} just the opposite occurs, with finite closed islands in an infinite open ocean. The picture is more complicated when {{math|''d'' \u2265 3}} since {{math|''p''<sub>c</sub> < {{sfrac|1|2}}}}, and there is coexistence of infinite open and closed clusters for {{math|''p''}} between {{math|''p''<sub>c</sub>}} and&nbsp;{{math|1 \u2212 ''p''<sub>c</sub>}}.\n\n===Critical===\n\nThe model has a [[mathematical singularity|singularity]] at the critical point {{math|''p'' {{=}} ''p''<sub>c</sub>}} believed to be of power-law type. [[Critical scaling|Scaling theory]] predicts the existence of [[critical exponents]], depending on the number ''d'' of dimensions, that determine the class of the singularity. When {{math|''d'' {{=}} 2}} these predictions are backed up by arguments from [[conformal field theory]] and [[Schramm\u2013Loewner evolution]], and include predicted numerical values for the exponents. Most of these predictions are conjectural except when the number {{math|''d''}} of dimensions satisfies either {{math|''d'' {{=}} 2}} or {{math|''d'' \u2265 19}}. They include:\n\n* There are no infinite clusters (open or closed)\n* The probability that there is an open path from some fixed point (say the origin) to a distance of {{math|''r''}} decreases ''polynomially'', i.e. is [[big O notation|on the order of]] {{math|''r''<sup>''\u03b1''</sup>}} for some&nbsp;{{math|''\u03b1''}}\n** {{math|''\u03b1''}} does not depend on the particular lattice chosen, or on other local parameters.

The p\u014dhutukawa is one of twelve ''[[Metrosideros]]'' species [[Endemism|endemic]] to [[New Zealand]]. Renowned for its vibrant colour and its ability to survive even perched on rocky, precarious cliffs, it has found an important place in New Zealand culture for its strength and beauty and is regarded as a chiefly tree (''{{lang|mi|r\u0101kau rangatira}}'') by M\u0101ori.<ref name=\"KING\">{{cite news|page=5|title=The Hauraki Gulf Marine Park, Part 2|newspaper=Inset to [[The New Zealand Herald]]|date=2 March 2010}}</ref> The blossom of the tree is called ''{{lang|mi|kahika}}''.<ref name=plantuse/>\n\n==Etymology==\nThe generic name ''Metrosideros'' derives from the [[Ancient Greek language|Ancient Greek]] ''{{lang|grc|metra}}'' or \"[[heartwood]]\" and ''{{lang|grc|sideron}}'' or \"iron\". The [[specific name (botany)|species name]] ''excelsa'' is from [[Latin language|Latin]] ''{{lang|la|excelsus}}'', \"highest, sublime\". ''{{lang|mi|P\u014dhutukawa}}'' is a [[M\u0101ori language|M\u0101ori word]].

It usually grows as a multi-trunked spreading tree. Its trunks and branches are sometimes festooned with matted, fibrous [[aerial root]]s. The oblong, leathery leaves are covered in dense white hairs underneath.<ref name=\"Wassilieff\"/>\n\nThe tree flowers from November to January with a peak in mid to late December (the [[Southern Hemisphere]] summer), with brilliant crimson flowers covering the tree, hence the nickname New Zealand Christmas tree. There is variation between individual trees in the timing of flowering, and in the shade and brightness of the flowers. In isolated populations [[genetic drift]] has resulted in local variation: many of the trees growing around the Rotorua lakes produce pink-shaded flowers, and the yellow-flowered [[cultivar]] 'Aurea' descends from a pair discovered in 1940 on [[M\u014dtiti Island]] in the [[Bay of Plenty]].\n\n== Uses ==\nP\u014dhutukawa wood is dense, strong and highly figured. Maori used it for beaters and other small, heavy items. It was frequently used in shipbuilding, since the naturally curvy shapes made strong knees.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.naw.org.nz/resources/trees/pohutukawa.pdf |title=POHUTUKAWA |publisher=National Association of Woodworkers New Zealand Inc}}</ref>\n\n==Distribution==\nThe natural range of the p\u014dhutukawa is the coastal regions of the [[North Island]] of [[New Zealand]], north of a line stretching from [[New Plymouth]] (39\u00b0 S) to [[Gisborne, New Zealand|Gisborne]] (38\u00b0 S),<ref>{{cite book|url=http://www.doc.govt.nz/upload/documents/science-and-technical/casn100.pdf|title=Pohutukawa and Diversity|first=Philip G.|last=Simpson|work=Conservation Advisory Science Notes No. 100|publisher=Department of Conservation|year=1994|issn=1171-9834|page=3}}</ref> where it once formed a continuous coastal fringe. By the 1990s, pastoral farming and introduced pests had reduced p\u014dhutukawa forests by over 90%.<ref name=\"KING\"/> It also occurs naturally on the shores of lakes in the [[Rotorua]] area and in [[Abel Tasman National Park]] at the top of South Island.\n\nA giant p\u014dhutukawa at [[Te Araroa]] on the East Coast is reputed to be the largest in the country, with a height of 20 metres and a spread of {{convert|38|m|ft}}.<ref name=\"Survival\">{{cite web |url=http://www.treesforsurvival.org.nz/resources.cfm |title=Native Plant Information |accessdate=2007-03-13 |publisher=Trees for Survival |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080221193256/http://www.treesforsurvival.org.nz/resources.cfm |archivedate=2008-02-21}}</ref> The tree is renowned as a cliff-dweller, able to maintain a hold in precarious, near-vertical situations.

Vigorous and easy to grow, the tree flourishes well south of its natural range, and has naturalised in the [[Wellington]] area and in the north of the [[South Island]]. It has also naturalised on [[Norfolk Island]] to the north. The p\u014dhutukawa has been introduced to other countries with mild-to-warm climates, including south-eastern [[Australia]], where it is naturalising on coastal cliffs near [[Sydney]]. In coastal [[California]], it is a popular street and lawn tree, but has caused concern in [[San Francisco]] where its root systems are blamed for destroying sewer lines and sidewalks.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/27/us/27bcjames.html?_r=0|title=A Green Idea That Sounded Good Until the Trees Went to Work|newspaper=The Bay Citizen|date=27 August 2010|author=Scott James}}</ref> In parts of [[South Africa]], the p\u014dhutukawa grows so well that it is regarded as an [[invasive species]].

(disambiguation)|computer game of the same name]] created by [[Br\u00f8derbund|Br\u00f8derbund Software]]. Just like its predecessor, the show was produced by [[WGBH-TV|WGBH Boston]] and [[WQED (TV)|WQED Pittsburgh]]. The program lasted two seasons on [[PBS]], consisting of 115 episodes, which ran from October 7, 1996 to December 12, 1997, with reruns airing until October 2, 1998. The show starred [[Lynne Thigpen]] as \"The Chief\", [[Kevin Shinick]] as \"ACME Time Pilot Squadron Leader\" and \"The Engine Crew\" as various informants.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/03/14/obituaries/14THIG.html |title=Lynne Thigpen, Actress in CBS's 'District,' Dies at 54 |website=NYTimes.com |date=2003-03-14 |accessdate=2016-03-30}}</ref> The show replaced ''[[Where in the World Is Carmen Sandiego? (game show)|Where in the World Is Carmen Sandiego?]]'', and was recorded entirely at [[Kaufman Astoria Studios]] in Queens, New York City.\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[Cold open|Before the show began]], the viewing audience would see [[Carmen Sandiego (character)|Carmen Sandiego]] in her V.I.L.E. headquarters (in Season 1, Carmen appeared in a [[fourth wall]] type of narration; in Season 2, a [[Nanorobotics|surveillance nano-probe]] filmed Carmen's lair unnoticed) complaining to herself and plotting to steal the historical \"seed\" of her complaint. Carmen then summoned one of her V.I.L.E. henchmen or henchwomen and told him/her what to steal and where to go. (In Season One, she would shine an 'Info-Beam' to give the details of the object in question; in Season Two, she would give the thief a 'Loot Orb' or 'Cybersphere' to contain it.) The Chief then told the audience that Carmen's chosen henchman had stolen something, which had to be recovered in 28 minutes (the length of each episode) to prevent [[temporal paradox]]. The show then began with the Engine Crew preparing the ACME Chronoskimmer (a [[flying saucer]] capable of [[time travel]]) for launch and then singing the show's theme song while dancing. Afterwards, the Chief would introduce host 'Kevin Shinick'. In the first season, Kevin would enter from the left of the Chronoskimmer giving a sal6. In Season 2, Kevin was seen goofing around in his room until the Chief called him to do the show by saying his name to get attention. He would then enter from the right of the Chronoskimmer.\n\n===Round One===\nThree players (ages 10\u201314) known as \"Time Pilots\" competed. Each was given 100 'Power Points' to begin. The Chief identified the stolen object and its source, and various skits give clues to the location. After a skit, three possible answers or locations were shown to the pilots. The viewer could see the individual choices represented by an individual color (pink, green, or blue). Any pilot with the correct answer scored 10 Power Points, with no penalty given for an incorrect answer.\n\nAt one point in the game, Carmen's henchman would provide a clue from the viewscreen. The points in time visited followed the historical progression of the \"seed\" originally stolen. The typical course of the round was as follows:\n\n* Data Boost: At two points during the game (one in the second season), the episode's villain sabotaged the Chronoskimmer. (In Season One, a Data Boost was also done to replenish the Chronoskimmer's 'Fact Fuel'). In Season Two, the Engine Crew would report the problem. During the Boost, Kevin read clues in a given subject and gave the pilots a choice of 2 or 3 answers. The first pilot to buzz in and guess the correct answer scored 5 Power Points, but lost 5 Power Points for wrong answers.\n* Global Pursuit: After one skit, the Global Pursuit round was played, for a series of questions were asked, each containing one of three possible answers. Only one pilot could buzz in for 5 Power Points up or down. This round in some episodes came before the Data Boost, and played similarly to the Chase round of ''[[Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego? (game show)|Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego?]]''\n* Ultimate Data Boost: This was just like a normal Data Boost, but the questions were worth plus or minus 10 Power Points.\n\nThe two pilots with the highest scores after the first round advanced to the second round, while the third-placed pilot was eliminated from the game. If there was a tie between two pilots for second place, or a three-way tie for first place, a tiebreaker question was asked.\n\nThere were also other ways to gain clues:\n\n* Cluefinder: The Cluefinder was an alarm identifying a clue, whereupon a historical figure or object appeared aboard the Chronoskimmer to reveal more clues.\n* V.I.L.E. Villain: The show's villain was shown revealing a clue; ostensibly against his or her intention.  When this happened, Kevin often exclaimed, \"We're losing communications!\", if the villain was taking over the ship. On other occasions, the ship's nano-probes would film the villain reporting to Carmen, still giving the clue to the contestants.\n* Collision Alert: Where in Kevin conversed with a possible 'future' version of himself, to acquire clues.\n* Parallel Universe: Clues were given by Commisaar (an evil Chief) and an evil Kevin from ACME Slimenet, the evil version of ACME Timenet.\n* Omnicia: On certain occasions, when Kevin ran out of clues, he would ask the Chief to contact an omniscient informant known as Omnicia. Contacting Omnicia took a lot of power, according to the Chief. She would warn Kevin that they may not have enough power, but Kevin would tell her that they had to risk it.\n* Engine Crew's Clues: The Engine Crew sang the clues of the year from the Engine Room. On other occasions, the Engine Crew were in the Chronoskimmer's cafeteria conversing with Libby the Cafeteria Robot (portrayed by Thigpen).\n* Intruder Alert: The Intruder Alert alarm alerted Kevin to an intruder in his bedroom, which was Sector 5, where a figure representing his mother revealed the clue.\n* Millenia: \"The world's oldest woman;\" she ostensibly had been around for almost everything. She was portrayed by Thigpen.\n* Elephant Guy: A businessman being chased by an elephant gave clues to the time pilots. Portrayed by Owen Taylor.\n* The Unknown Explorer: An old bearded sailor riding on a float provided a clue. Portrayed by John Latham.\n* ACME Street Entertainers: Three street entertainers (portrayed by The Engine Crew) performed in front of some of the studio audience members and gave out a clue.\n* Molecular Generator Clue: Kevin found clues inside the Chronoskimmer's Molecular Generator.\n* TIMENET Weather Report: A weather woman with a southern accent (portrayed by Alaine Kashian) gave clues during her weather report.\n\n===Round Two===\nWith Kevin on command, the two remaining pilots activated the Loot Tractor Beam to capture the stolen artifact. The Chief then listed eight events, related to the artifact that was stolen, that the pilots had to recite in reverse chronological order. The first pilot to recite the events in the correct order advanced to the Bonus Round to capture Carmen and the day's villain, while the runner-up won a CD player and Carmen Sandiego merchandise.\n\n===Bonus Round: The Trail of Time===\nThe winning pilot had 1:30 (90 seconds) to answer questions at several \"Time Portals\", posed by Carmen, with each portal themed to a particular period of time. All questions were related to the artifact stolen in the day's show, and contained two choices each. If the pilot answered a question correctly, the gate opened automatically. Otherwise, the pilot was required to operate a device to manually open the gate. After the first two or three gates, the pilot captured the day's villain; whereas if the pilot passed through all six gates before time expired, he or she was permitted to capture Carmen and win a computer system. The Engine Crew always guided the pilot to the appropriate portal using hand signals; in the second season, the portal flashed to help them. If Carmen escaped, the pilot received a portable music system in addition to a 32-volume set of [[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]] (in season 1) or an ACME Time Net mission pack (in season 2). If Carmen was captured, the time pilot had to put a \"capture crystal\" into the \"chronolock chamber\" in order to fully capture her, and he/she would win the computer system.\n\nThe show always ended with Kevin, the pilot, and the Engine Crew saying: \"At ACME Time Net, history is our job, and the future is yours!\", followed by the theme song being played again, as they all headed back to the present.\n\n==Episodes==\nSeason 1 lasted 65 episodes and ran from October 7, 1996 until January 3, 1997. Season 2 lasted for 50 episodes and ran from October 6, 1997 until December 12, 1997.<ref name=\"locatetv\"/> Reruns of the show continued on PBS until October 2, 1998.\n\n==V.I.L.E. gang==\nOther than playing the Engine Crew, Owen Taylor, Jamie Gustis, Alaine Kashian, and John Lathan as well as James Greenberg (who was also one of the show's producers) and Paula Leggett Chase also portrayed Carmen's V.I.L.E. minions.\n\n*[[Carmen Sandiego]] (''Janine LaManna'', Season 1; ''Brenda Burke'', Season 2) \u2013 V.I.L.E.'s mastermind, portrayed as a straight villain. Though her iconic red trench coat and fedora were visible, her face was largely obscured. Carmen herself was played by general cast members Janine LaManna and Brenda Burke. They were not credited, because the actresses also played \"good\" characters who would help the contestants.<ref>{{cite web|last=Van Luling |first=Todd |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/carmen-sandiego-found_us_578e6f4fe4b07c722ebc73ca? |title=My 20-Year Quest To Find Carmen Sandiego |publisher=The Huffington Post |date=2016-08-16 |accessdate=August 16, 2016}}</ref>\n*[[Baron]] Wasteland (''James Greenberg'', Season 1 only) \u2013 A moustached villain wearing a V-marked eyepatch; a wealthy [[aristocracy|aristocrat]] who loves [[pollution]] and enjoys destroying the [[natural environment|environment]]. His name is a play on \"barren wasteland\" and he is supposedly a native of the [[Industrial Era]].  He was only in the first season, being replaced by Buggs Zapper in Season 2 (see below).  His getaway animation showed his body shattering into several triangular shards. When assaulting the Chronoskimmer, he would shock it with [[lightning]] emitted by his cane. He was the only villain on the show not adapted into the newer version of the computer game, although the game featured a different villain holding the title of baron, that being Baron Grinnit (\"grin and bear it\").\n* Buggs Zapper (''James Greenberg'', Season 2 only) \u2013 Buggs Zapper is a New York-accented [[gangster]] with a fear of [[insect]]s who wears a [[pin striping|pinstriped]] [[suit (clothing)|suit]] and constantly carries an old-fashioned [[Flit gun|bug sprayer]]. He was introduced in the second season, replacing Baron Wasteland (see above). In the computer game's manual, it is stated that his only goal in life is to \"rub out\" a single [[fly]] that may exist only in his imagination. When assaulting the Chronoskimmer, he was shown spraying a cloud of pesticide from his bug sprayer into an open hatch. His time era is presumably the 1920s to the 1930s. His name is a play on \"[[bug zapper]]\" and gangster [[Bugsy Malone]].\n* Dr. Belljar (''Owen Taylor'', Season 1) & (''Jamie Gustis'', Season 2) \u2013 A [[cyborg]] [[mad scientist]]. His name apparently refers to [[bell jar]]s. He appeared on both of the show's seasons, but his appearance was drastically retooled for the second season. His getaway animation in the first season showed him disintegrated into a multitude of cubes through a device mounted on his wrist. In the second he was simply obscured by television static. In season 1, he assaulted the Chronoskimmer by zapping it with electricity from his fingertips (identified as the 'Misinformation Missile'). In the second season, he sabotaged the systems directly.\n* Jacqueline Hyde{{anchor|JHyde}}<!-- The preceding span tag is a heading-less target for internal links, e.g. one used by the Dab [[Jacqueline Hyde]] --> (''Alaine Kashian'') \u2013 Jacqueline Hyde is a [[split personality]], one (\"Jacqueline\") being sweet-tempered and innocent with the other (\"Hyde\") being vindictive and insane. She repeatedly alternates between her personalities, with each surfacing for a few seconds. She wears a [[red]] [[blazer]], a [[pink]] [[blouse]], a red [[miniskirt]] and knee-length stockings, perhaps to suggest a traditional schoolgirl uniform of the early-to-mid-20th century. Her getaway was becoming a sphere and floating from sight. In the first season, she assaulted the Chronoskimmer by throwing an orb of electricity; whereas in the second season, she physically sabotaged the craft at an open maintenance panel. Her name is a play on \"[[Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde|Dr. Jeykll & Mr. Hyde]]\".\n* Medeva (''Paula Leggett Chase'') \u2013 Medeva is a [[witchcraft|witch]] from the [[Middle Ages]] who mostly speaks in [[rhyme]]. In season one, she assaulted the Chronoskimmer by breathing fire at it; and in the second, she would cast a spell into an open maintenance panel. Her name seems to be a [[portmanteau]] of [[Medea]] (a sorceress in Greek mythology) and \"diva\", or a play on the term [[medieval]].\n* Sir Vile (''John Lathan'') \u2013 Sir Vile is an obsequious medieval [[knight]]. In the first season, his armor was a dull silver; but appeared fiery red in the second. In season one, he assaulted the Chromoskimmer by striking with lightning; whereas in the second season, he was shown ripping a cable from a maintenance panel and breathing fire into the opening. His name is a play on the adjective \"servile\", owing to how obsequious he acts around Carmen Sandiego.\n\n==Prizes==\nThe budget was smaller on this version of the show compared to ''World''. As a result, the grand prize for a winning pilot capturing Carmen was a computer system instead of a trip. If the contestant did not win in the trail of time, he/she received a set of encyclopedias and a stereo system. Pilots on all levels received the ACME Time Net Mission Pack, which consisted of: a baseball cap, a T-shirt, a ''Where in Time Is Carmen Sandiego?'' board game, a ''Where in the U.S.A. Is Carmen Sandiego?'' board game, a ''Where in Space is Carmen Sandiego?'' board game, a plastic watch, an [[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]] World Atlas, and a set of the most recent Carmen Sandiego CD-ROM games (all of which also featured Lynne Thigpen as the Chief).\n\n==Production==\n\n=== Conception ===\nThe series was created as a spin-off of the long-running geography game show, ''Where in the World Is Carmen Sandiego?.''<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://current.org/wp-content/uploads/archive-site/ch/ch603.html|title=Current.org {{!}} PBS shows for older kids|website=current.org|access-date=2018-12-29}}</ref> Executive producers Kate Taylor of WGBH and Jay Rayvid of WQED wanted to refocus the show on history as a recent study had shown American children were weak in this area, and because Broderbund had already create a game in this field.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/10/20/movies/what-in-the-world-s-with-carmen-sandiego.html|title=What in the World's With 'Carmen Sandiego'?|last=Diesenhouse|first=Susan|date=1996-10-20|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-12-29|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> Taylor noted that it was important to them to create something new and fresh and different for fans of the original show.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAround 10% of each half hour episode consisted of computer-generated animation and 3-D special effects, and the graphics/illustration for all episodes in a season were produced in around four months.

The music package included the theme song and the songs about clues in the engine room. The theme was played in the opening and closing sequences. When the contestant was heading for the trail of time, the theme was sometimes edited after the crew sang, \"We're on the case\" and the villains say, \"And they're chasing us through history!\" (used in first season). In the second season, when the contestant headed for The Trail of Time, the ending was normal instead of the villains singing the end part. The show's main theme song was written by [[Sean Altman]] of [[Rockapella]] and [[David Yazbek]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.seanaltman.com/sean96b.shtml|title=SeanTalk - Sean Altman's Seanecdotes|website=www.seanaltman.com|access-date=2018-12-29}}</ref> and is sung by The Engine Crew.\n\nLike its predecessor series, which faced outdated information during its run, the end of every episode had an audible disclaimer from Lynne Thigpen stating that \"All historic information has been verified by [[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|Encyclopedia Britannica]] (and was accurate as of the date this program was recorded).\" with the recording date shown with the copyright information at the end of each episode.\n\nThe show was funded primarily by the [[Corporation for Public Broadcasting]] and by the annual financial support from the viewers/stations of PBS throughout the entire series. [[Delta Air Lines]] and the National Endowment for Children's Educational Television both provided funding during the show's first season.\n\nScott Wells served as the 3-D animator while  Raeford Dwyer was the animation producer; together they gave the show a style that mixed computer-treated video FMV performances computer-generated two- and three-dimensional animation and special effects. <ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/10/20/movies/what-in-the-world-s-with-carmen-sandiego.html|title=What in the World's With 'Carmen Sandiego'?|last=Diesenhouse|first=Susan|date=1996-10-20|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-09-06|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>\n\nA live version of the World and Time shows (\"Carmen Sandiego Live\") was performed at 85 sites across the United States and Canada from 1993-7.\n\n== Critical reception ==\nThe New York Times felt the show stood out among new afternoon series.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/11/03/tv/fattening-up-the-menu-for-children-s-tv.html|title=Fattening Up the Menu for Children's TV|last=Mifflin|first=Lawrie|date=1996-11-03|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-12-29|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>\n\n==Awards==\n''Where in Time is Carmen Sandiego'' has been nominated thirteen times for awards.

The French theme song was written and produced by [[Randy Vancourt]]. This version of the show stars Brigitte Paquette as \"The Chief\", Patrick Labb\u00e9 as \"ACME Time Pilot Squadron Leader\", and Daniel D\u00f4, Marie-H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Fortin, and Widemir Noumil as \"The Engine Crew\". Gameplay in this version stayed the same as the original, with each pilot going through all six gates and capturing Carmen wins a grand prize package that included a mountain bike instead of a computer system. Joe Bocan played Carmen Sandiego.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wikiquote}}\n* [http://kyranthia.net/time.html Where In Time Is Carmen Sandiego? at kyranthia]\n* [https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/3379244?uid=3737536&uid=2&uid=4&sid=21101285337923 Public Historians and Public Television: Collaborating on \"Where in Time Is Carmen Sandiego?\"]\n\n{{Carmen Sandiego}}\n{{PastPBSKids shows}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Where in Time Is Carmen Sandiego?

(disambiguation)|computer game of the same name]] created by [[Br\u00f8derbund|Br\u00f8derbund Software]]. Just like its predecessor, the show was produced by [[WGBH-TV|WGBH Boston]] and [[WQED (TV)|WQED Pittsburgh]]. The program lasted two seasons on [[PBS]], consisting of 115 episodes, which ran from October 7, 1996 to December 12, 1997, with reruns airing until October 2, 1998. The show starred [[Lynne Thigpen]] as \"The Chief\", [[Kevin Shinick]] as \"ACME Time Pilot Squadron Leader\" and \"The Engine Crew\" as various informants.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/03/14/obituaries/14THIG.html |title=Lynne Thigpen, Actress in CBS's 'District,' Dies at 54 |website=NYTimes.com |date=2003-03-14 |accessdate=2016-03-30}}</ref> The show replaced ''[[Where in the World Is Carmen Sandiego? (game show)|Where in the World Is Carmen Sandiego?]]'', and was recorded entirely at [[Kaufman Astoria Studios]] in Queens, New York City.\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[Cold open|Before the show began]], the viewing audience would see [[Carmen Sandiego (character)|Carmen Sandiego]] in her V.I.L.E. headquarters (in Season 1, Carmen appeared in a [[fourth wall]] type of narration; in Season 2, a [[Nanorobotics|surveillance nano-probe]] filmed Carmen's lair unnoticed) complaining to herself and plotting to steal the historical \"seed\" of her complaint. Carmen then summoned one of her V.I.L.E. henchmen or henchwomen and told him/her what to steal and where to go. (In Season One, she would shine an 'Info-Beam' to give the details of the object in question; in Season Two, she would give the thief a 'Loot Orb' or 'Cybersphere' to contain it.) The Chief then told the audience that Carmen's chosen henchman had stolen something, which had to be recovered in 28 minutes (the length of each episode) to prevent [[temporal paradox]]. The show then began with the Engine Crew preparing the ACME Chronoskimmer (a [[flying saucer]] capable of [[time travel]]) for launch and then singing the show's theme song while dancing. Afterwards, the Chief would introduce host 'Kevin Shinick'. In the first season, Kevin would enter from the left of the Chronoskimmer. In Season 2, Kevin was seen goofing around in his room until the Chief called him to do the show. He would then enter from the right of the Chronoskimmer.\n\n===Round One===\nThree players (ages 10\u201314) known as \"Time Pilots\" competed. Each was given 100 'Power Points' to begin. The Chief identified the stolen object and its source, and various skits give clues to the location. After a skit, three possible answers or locations were shown to the pilots. The viewer could see the individual choices represented by an individual color (pink, green, or blue). Any pilot with the correct answer scored 10 Power Points, with no penalty given for an incorrect answer.\n\nAt one point in the game, Carmen's henchman would provide a clue from the viewscreen. The points in time visited followed the historical progression of the \"seed\" originally stolen. The typical course of the round was as follows:\n\n* Data Boost: At two points during the game (one in the second season), the episode's villain sabotaged the Chronoskimmer. (In Season One, a Data Boost was also done to replenish the Chronoskimmer's 'Fact Fuel'). In Season Two, the Engine Crew would report the problem. During the Boost, Kevin read clues in a given subject and gave the pilots a choice of 2 or 3 answers. The first pilot to buzz in and guess the correct answer scored 5 Power Points, but lost 5 Power Points for wrong answers.\n* Global Pursuit: After one skit, the Global Pursuit round was played, for a series of questions were asked, each containing one of three possible answers. Only one pilot could buzz in for 5 Power Points up or down. This round in some episodes came before the Data Boost, and played similarly to the Chase round of ''[[Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego? (game show)|Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego?]]''\n* Ultimate Data Boost: This was just like a normal Data Boost, but the questions were worth plus or minus 10 Power Points.\n\nThe two pilots with the highest scores after the first round advanced to the second round, while the third-placed pilot was eliminated from the game. If there was a tie between two pilots for second place, or a three-way tie for first place, a tiebreaker question was asked.\n\nThere were also other ways to gain clues:\n\n* Cluefinder: The Cluefinder was an alarm identifying a clue, whereupon a historical figure or object appeared aboard the Chronoskimmer to reveal more clues.\n* V.I.L.E. Villain: The show's villain was shown revealing a clue; ostensibly against his or her intention.  When this happened, Kevin often exclaimed, \"We're losing communications!\", if the villain was taking over the ship. On other occasions, the ship's nano-probes would film the villain reporting to Carmen, still giving the clue to the contestants.\n* Collision Alert: Where in Kevin conversed with a possible 'future' version of himself, to acquire clues.\n* Parallel Universe: Clues were given by Commisaar (an evil Chief) and an evil Kevin from ACME Slimenet, the evil version of ACME Timenet.\n* Omnicia: On certain occasions, when Kevin ran out of clues, he would ask the Chief to contact an omniscient informant known as Omnicia. Contacting Omnicia took a lot of power, according to the Chief. She would warn Kevin that they may not have enough power, but Kevin would tell her that they had to risk it.\n* Engine Crew's Clues: The Engine Crew sang the clues of the year from the Engine Room. On other occasions, the Engine Crew were in the Chronoskimmer's cafeteria conversing with Libby the Cafeteria Robot (portrayed by Thigpen).\n* Intruder Alert: The Intruder Alert alarm alerted Kevin to an intruder in his bedroom, which was Sector 5, where a figure representing his mother revealed the clue.\n* Millenia: \"The world's oldest woman;\" she ostensibly had been around for almost everything. She was portrayed by Thigpen.\n* Elephant Guy: A businessman being chased by an elephant gave clues to the time pilots. Portrayed by Owen Taylor.\n* The Unknown Explorer: An old bearded sailor riding on a float provided a clue. Portrayed by John Latham.\n* ACME Street Entertainers: Three street entertainers (portrayed by The Engine Crew) performed in front of some of the studio audience members and gave out a clue.\n* Molecular Generator Clue: Kevin found clues inside the Chronoskimmer's Molecular Generator.\n* TIMENET Weather Report: A weather woman with a southern accent (portrayed by Alaine Kashian) gave clues during her weather report.\n\n===Round Two===\nWith Kevin on command, the two remaining pilots activated the Loot Tractor Beam to capture the stolen artifact. The Chief then listed eight events, related to the artifact that was stolen, that the pilots had to recite in reverse chronological order. The first pilot to recite the events in the correct order advanced to the Bonus Round to capture Carmen and the day's villain, while the runner-up won a CD player and Carmen Sandiego merchandise.\n\n===Bonus Round: The Trail of Time===\nThe winning pilot had 1:30 (90 seconds) to answer questions at several \"Time Portals\", posed by Carmen, with each portal themed to a particular period of time. All questions were related to the artifact stolen in the day's show, and contained two choices each. If the pilot answered a question correctly, the gate opened automatically. Otherwise, the pilot was required to operate a device to manually open the gate. After the first two or three gates, the pilot captured the day's villain; whereas if the pilot passed through all six gates before time expired, he or she was permitted to capture Carmen and win a computer system. The Engine Crew always guided the pilot to the appropriate portal using hand signals; in the second season, the portal flashed to help them. If Carmen escaped, the pilot received a portable music system in addition to a 32-volume set of [[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]] (in season 1) or an ACME Time Net mission pack (in season 2). If Carmen was captured, the time pilot had to put a \"capture crystal\" into the \"chronolock chamber\" in order to fully capture her, and he/she would win the computer system.\n\nThe show always ended with Kevin, the pilot, and the Engine Crew saying: \"At ACME Time Net, history is our job, and the future is yours!\", followed by the theme song being played again, as they all headed back to the present.\n\n==Episodes==\nSeason 1 lasted 65 episodes and ran from October 7, 1996 until January 3, 1997. Season 2 lasted for 50 episodes and ran from October 6, 1997 until December 12, 1997.<ref name=\"locatetv\"/> Reruns of the show continued on PBS until October 2, 1998.\n\n==V.I.L.E. gang==\nOther than playing the Engine Crew, Owen Taylor, Jamie Gustis, Alaine Kashian, and John Lathan as well as James Greenberg (who was also one of the show's producers) and Paula Leggett Chase also portrayed Carmen's V.I.L.E. minions.\n\n*[[Carmen Sandiego]] (''Janine LaManna'', Season 1; ''Brenda Burke'', Season 2) \u2013 V.I.L.E.'s mastermind, portrayed as a straight villain. Though her iconic red trench coat and fedora were visible, her face was largely obscured. Carmen herself was played by general cast members Janine LaManna and Brenda Burke. They were not credited, because the actresses also played \"good\" characters who would help the contestants.<ref>{{cite web|last=Van Luling |first=Todd |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/carmen-sandiego-found_us_578e6f4fe4b07c722ebc73ca? |title=My 20-Year Quest To Find Carmen Sandiego |publisher=The Huffington Post |date=2016-08-16 |accessdate=August 16, 2016}}</ref>\n*[[Baron]] Wasteland (''James Greenberg'', Season 1 only) \u2013 A moustached villain wearing a V-marked eyepatch; a wealthy [[aristocracy|aristocrat]] who loves [[pollution]] and enjoys destroying the [[natural environment|environment]]. His name is a play on \"barren wasteland\" and he is supposedly a native of the [[Industrial Era]].  He was only in the first season, being replaced by Buggs Zapper in Season 2 (see below).  His getaway animation showed his body shattering into several triangular shards. When assaulting the Chronoskimmer, he would shock it with [[lightning]] emitted by his cane. He was the only villain on the show not adapted into the newer version of the computer game, although the game featured a different villain holding the title of baron, that being Baron Grinnit (\"grin and bear it\").\n* Buggs Zapper (''James Greenberg'', Season 2 only) \u2013 Buggs Zapper is a New York-accented [[gangster]] with a fear of [[insect]]s who wears a [[pin striping|pinstriped]] [[suit (clothing)|suit]] and constantly carries an old-fashioned [[Flit gun|bug sprayer]]. He was introduced in the second season, replacing Baron Wasteland (see above). In the computer game's manual, it is stated that his only goal in life is to \"rub out\" a single [[fly]] that may exist only in his imagination. When assaulting the Chronoskimmer, he was shown spraying a cloud of pesticide from his bug sprayer into an open hatch. His time era is presumably the 1920s to the 1930s. His name is a play on \"[[bug zapper]]\" and gangster [[Bugsy Malone]].\n* Dr. Belljar (''Owen Taylor'', Season 1) & (''Jamie Gustis'', Season 2) \u2013 A [[cyborg]] [[mad scientist]]. His name apparently refers to [[bell jar]]s. He appeared on both of the show's seasons, but his appearance was drastically retooled for the second season. His getaway animation in the first season showed him disintegrated into a multitude of cubes through a device mounted on his wrist. In the second he was simply obscured by television static. In season 1, he assaulted the Chronoskimmer by zapping it with electricity from his fingertips (identified as the 'Misinformation Missile'). In the second season, he sabotaged the systems directly.\n* Jacqueline Hyde{{anchor|JHyde}}<!-- The preceding span tag is a heading-less target for internal links, e.g. one used by the Dab [[Jacqueline Hyde]] --> (''Alaine Kashian'') \u2013 Jacqueline Hyde is a [[split personality]], one (\"Jacqueline\") being sweet-tempered and innocent with the other (\"Hyde\") being vindictive and insane. She repeatedly alternates between her personalities, with each surfacing for a few seconds. She wears a [[red]] [[blazer]], a [[pink]] [[blouse]], a red [[miniskirt]] and knee-length stockings, perhaps to suggest a traditional schoolgirl uniform of the early-to-mid-20th century. Her getaway was becoming a sphere and floating from sight. In the first season, she assaulted the Chronoskimmer by throwing an orb of electricity; whereas in the second season, she physically sabotaged the craft at an open maintenance panel. Her name is a play on \"[[Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde|Dr. Jeykll & Mr. Hyde]]\".\n* Medeva (''Paula Leggett Chase'') \u2013 Medeva is a [[witchcraft|witch]] from the [[Middle Ages]] who mostly speaks in [[rhyme]]. In season one, she assaulted the Chronoskimmer by breathing fire at it; and in the second, she would cast a spell into an open maintenance panel. Her name seems to be a [[portmanteau]] of [[Medea]] (a sorceress in Greek mythology) and \"diva\", or a play on the term [[medieval]].\n* Sir Vile (''John Lathan'') \u2013 Sir Vile is an obsequious medieval [[knight]]. In the first season, his armor was a dull silver; but appeared fiery red in the second. In season one, he assaulted the Chromoskimmer by striking with lightning; whereas in the second season, he was shown ripping a cable from a maintenance panel and breathing fire into the opening. His name is a play on the adjective \"servile\", owing to how obsequious he acts around Carmen Sandiego.\n\n==Prizes==\nThe budget was smaller on this version of the show compared to ''World''. As a result, the grand prize for a winning pilot capturing Carmen was a computer system instead of a trip. If the contestant did not win in the trail of time, he/she received a set of encyclopedias and a stereo system. Pilots on all levels received the ACME Time Net Mission Pack, which consisted of: a baseball cap, a T-shirt, a ''Where in Time Is Carmen Sandiego?'' board game, a ''Where in the U.S.A. Is Carmen Sandiego?'' board game, a ''Where in Space is Carmen Sandiego?'' board game, a plastic watch, an [[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]] World Atlas, and a set of the most recent Carmen Sandiego CD-ROM games (all of which also featured Lynne Thigpen as the Chief).\n\n==Production==\n\n=== Conception ===\nThe series was created as a spin-off of the long-running geography game show, ''Where in the World Is Carmen Sandiego?.''<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://current.org/wp-content/uploads/archive-site/ch/ch603.html|title=Current.org {{!}} PBS shows for older kids|website=current.org|access-date=2018-12-29}}</ref> Executive producers Kate Taylor of WGBH and Jay Rayvid of WQED wanted to refocus the show on history as a recent study had shown American children were weak in this area, and because Broderbund had already create a game in this field.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/10/20/movies/what-in-the-world-s-with-carmen-sandiego.html|title=What in the World's With 'Carmen Sandiego'?|last=Diesenhouse|first=Susan|date=1996-10-20|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-12-29|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> Taylor noted that it was important to them to create something new and fresh and different for fans of the original show.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAround 10% of each half hour episode consisted of computer-generated animation and 3-D special effects, and the graphics/illustration for all episodes in a season were produced in around four months. The budget for each episode of the show' was $46,000.  Animator David J.

The music package included the theme song and the songs about clues in the engine room. The theme was played in the opening and closing sequences. When the contestant was heading for the trail of time, the theme was sometimes edited after the crew sang, \"We're on the case\" and the villains say, \"And they're chasing us through history!\" (used in first season). In the second season, when the contestant headed for The Trail of Time, the ending was normal instead of the villains singing the end part. The show's main theme song was written by [[Sean Altman]] of [[Rockapella]] and [[David Yazbek]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.seanaltman.com/sean96b.shtml|title=SeanTalk - Sean Altman's Seanecdotes|website=www.seanaltman.com|access-date=2018-12-29}}</ref> and is sung by The Engine Crew.\n\nLike its predecessor series, which faced outdated information during its run, the end of every episode had an audible disclaimer from Lynne Thigpen stating that \"All historic information has been verified by [[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|Encyclopedia Britannica]] (and was accurate as of the date this program was recorded).\" with the recording date shown with the copyright information at the end of each episode.\n\nThe show was funded primarily by the [[Corporation for Public Broadcasting]] and by the annual financial support from the viewers/stations of PBS throughout the entire series. [[Delta Air Lines]] and the National Endowment for Children's Educational Television both provided funding during the show's first season.\n\nScott Wells served as the 3-D animator while  Raeford Dwyer was the animation producer; together they gave the show a style that mixed computer-treated video FMV performances computer-generated two- and three-dimensional animation and special effects. <ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/10/20/movies/what-in-the-world-s-with-carmen-sandiego.html|title=What in the World's With 'Carmen Sandiego'?|last=Diesenhouse|first=Susan|date=1996-10-20|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-09-06|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>\n\nA live version of the World and Time shows (\"Carmen Sandiego Live\") was performed at 85 sites across the United States and Canada from 1993-7.\n\n== Critical reception ==\nThe New York Times felt the show stood out among new afternoon series.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/11/03/tv/fattening-up-the-menu-for-children-s-tv.html|title=Fattening Up the Menu for Children's TV|last=Mifflin|first=Lawrie|date=1996-11-03|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-12-29|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>\n\n==Awards==\n''Where in Time is Carmen Sandiego'' has been nominated thirteen times for awards.

The French theme song was written and produced by [[Randy Vancourt]]. This version of the show stars Brigitte Paquette as \"The Chief\", Patrick Labb\u00e9 as \"ACME Time Pilot Squadron Leader\", and Daniel D\u00f4, Marie-H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Fortin, and Widemir Noumil as \"The Engine Crew\".

It educates over 1,400 pupils aged between 11 and 18 and was founded in 1833 by the Rev. Dr [[Andrew Bell (educationalist)|Andrew Bell]].\n\n==History==\nMadras College, founded in 1833, takes its name from the system of education devised by the school's founder, the Rev. Dr [[Andrew Bell (educationalist)|Andrew Bell]] [[Royal Society of Edinburgh|FRSE]]. However, the origins of the school can be traced to at least the 1490s, through its predecessor institution, the '''Grammar School of St Andrews'''.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://pacific.st-andrews.ac.uk/DServe/dserve.exedsqIni=Dserve.ini&dsqApp=Archive&dsqCmd=Show.tcl&dsqDb=Catalog&dsqPos=16&dsqSearch=%28%28%28text%29%3D%27Grammar%27%29AND%28%28text%29%3D%27School%27%29%29}}</ref>\n\nBell was born in St Andrews in 1753, the son of a local magistrate and wig-maker. He studied at the [[University of St Andrews]] where he distinguished himself in mathematics. He became a clergyman of the [[Church of England]] and took up an appointment as chaplain to the regiments of the [[East India Company]] in [[Chennai|Madras]] (known since 1996 as Chennai), [[India]]. One of his duties was to educate the soldiers' children. Because there was a shortage of teachers, he used the older students, who had been taught the lesson by the master, to instruct groups of younger pupils. The pupils who assisted the teacher were called 'monitors'. This method of education became widely used in schools at home and abroad.\n\nAfter his return from India, Dr Bell made it his life's work to travel the country and encourage schools to adopt 'the [[Madras system]]', as it had come to be known. By the time of his death in 1832, over 10,000 schools were using his methods.\n\n[[File:Madras College, South Street, St. Andrews Fife.jpg|thumb|left|Madras College; the senior school building on South Street, St Andrews]]\nMadras College was founded in 1832 at the bequest and expense of Bell, as the amalgamation of several St Andrews schools. The first amalgamation was in 1833 when the old Grammar School of St Andrews was joined with the \"English\" school (founded in the 1750s) to form the Madras College. The origin of these names being that the Grammar School was taught mostly in [[Latin language|Latin]] while the \"English\" school used English only. The Grammar School stood on the grounds between Blackfriars' Church and Lade Braes; the \"English\" school was on the grounds behind the Church of Holy Trinity, approximately where the town library is today.\n\nThe second amalgamation happened in 1963, when Madras College was merged with the Burgh School (founded 1889, based in Abbey Walk). As part of this amalgamation and the introduction of comprehensive education, a new school building was contracted on Kilrymont Road, a mile and a half from the South Street building. The Kilrymont building was constructed in a [[modernist]] style, with adjacent playing fields and was opened in 1967.\n\nThe school is the only secondary school in Scotland on a split site. The school catchment area takes in a large part of rural north east Fife, and most of the pupils are transported in from the surrounding area by buses.\n\nThe badge is a chevron between three bells \u2013 a reference to Dr. Bell. The Latin motto is \"''pro rege et grege''\" which is customarily translated as \"For King and People\". It reminds the students of the importance of the idea of service to the community.\n\nBell also left money for schools in [[Inverness]] (Faraline Park, now Inverness Library), [[Glasgow]], [[Edinburgh]], [[Leith]] (Commercial Street) and [[Cupar]] (now called [[Bell Baxter High School]], formerly Madras Academy).\n\n== Staff ==\n\n=== Rectors ===\nFrom the foundation of Madras College in 1833 until 1888, the school was run by a board of trustees. As part of a series of reforms made at Madras in 1888/89, the position of rector was established. Since 1889 there have been eleven rectors of Madras College:\n\n* 1889\u20131915 Mr J.

It educates over 1,400 pupils aged between 11 and 18 and was founded in 1833 by the Rev. Dr [[Andrew Bell (educationalist)|Andrew Bell]].\n\n==History==\nMadras College, founded in 1833, takes its name from the system of education devised by the school's founder, the Rev. Dr [[Andrew Bell (educationalist)|Andrew Bell]] [[Royal Society of Edinburgh|FRSE]]. However, the origins of the school can be traced to at least the 1490s, through its predecessor institution, the '''Grammar School of St Andrews'''.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://pacific.st-andrews.ac.uk/DServe/dserve.exedsqIni=Dserve.ini&dsqApp=Archive&dsqCmd=Show.tcl&dsqDb=Catalog&dsqPos=16&dsqSearch=%28%28%28text%29%3D%27Grammar%27%29AND%28%28text%29%3D%27School%27%29%29}}</ref>\n\nBell was born in St Andrews in 1753, the son of a local magistrate and wig-maker. He studied at the [[University of St Andrews]] where he distinguished himself in mathematics. He became a clergyman of the [[Church of England]] and took up an appointment as chaplain to the regiments of the [[East India Company]] in [[Chennai|Madras]] (known since 1996 as Chennai), [[India]]. One of his duties was to educate the soldiers' children. Because there was a shortage of teachers, he used the older students, who had been taught the lesson by the master, to instruct groups of younger pupils. The pupils who assisted the teacher were called 'monitors'. This method of education became widely used in schools at home and abroad.\n\nAfter his return from India, Dr Bell made it his life's work to travel the country and encourage schools to adopt 'the [[Madras system]]', as it had come to be known. By the time of his death in 1832, over 10,000 schools were using his methods.\n\n[[File:Madras College, South Street, St. Andrews Fife.jpg|thumb|left|Madras College; the senior school building on South Street, St Andrews]]\nMadras College was founded in 1832 at the bequest and expense of Bell, as the amalgamation of several St Andrews schools. The first amalgamation was in 1833 when the old Grammar School of St Andrews was joined with the \"English\" school (founded in the 1750s) to form the Madras College. The origin of these names being that the Grammar School was taught mostly in [[Latin language|Latin]] while the \"English\" school used English only. The Grammar School stood on the grounds between Blackfriars' Church and Lade Braes; the \"English\" school was on the grounds behind the Church of Holy Trinity, approximately where the town library is today.\n\nThe second amalgamation happened in 1963, when Madras College was merged with the Burgh School (founded 1889, based in Abbey Walk). As part of this amalgamation and the introduction of comprehensive education, a new school building was contracted on Kilrymont Road, a mile and a half from the South Street building. The Kilrymont building was constructed in a [[modernist]] style, with adjacent playing fields and was opened in 1967.\n\nThe school is the only secondary school in Scotland on a split site. The school catchment area takes in a large part of rural north east Fife, and most of the pupils are transported in from the surrounding area by buses.\n\nThe badge is a chevron between three bells \u2013 a reference to Dr. Bell. The Latin motto is \"''pro rege et grege''\" which is customarily translated as \"For King and People\". It reminds the students of the importance of the idea of service to the community.\n\nBell also left money for schools in [[Inverness]] (Faraline Park, now Inverness Library), [[Glasgow]], [[Edinburgh]], [[Leith]] (Commercial Street) and [[Cupar]] (now called [[Bell Baxter High School]], formerly Madras Academy).\n\n== Staff ==\n\n=== Rectors ===\nFrom the foundation of Madras College in 1833 until 1888, the school was run by a board of trustees. As part of a series of reforms made at Madras in 1888/89, the position of rector was established. Since 1889 there have been eleven rectors of Madras College:\n\n* 1889\u20131915 Mr J.
