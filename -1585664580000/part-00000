Although Leeds soon recovered they had lost too much ground in the race for 3rd and 4th place consecutive defeats to Manchester United 3-4 and Tottenham 1-2 all but ended Leeds hopes of finishing in the top 4, United would finish 5th which after spending 100 million in recent years on player signings and with one of the best squads in the Premiership was a disappointment. In June David O'Leary manager since October 1998 was sacked by chairman Peter Risdale.    \n\nPlans were unveiled on 5 September for a new 50,000-seat stadium at [[Skelton, West Yorkshire|Skelton]] to replace [[Elland Road]], with Ridsdale hoping to have it ready by the summer of 2004. In fact, Ridsdale was aware that millions of pounds had been staked on Champions League qualification - by not qualifying in successive years, the club was heading for financial meltdown.\n\n==Final

Some contribute their downfall to their FA Cup third round exit at [[Ninian Park]]; table-topping Leeds played mid-table Division 2 side [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]] but suffered a 2\u20131 defeat with goals from [[Graham Kavanagh]] and [[Scott Young (Welsh footballer)|Scott Young]]. Leeds did not look like the same team after this, and didn't win another game for nearly two months. While they won seven of their last ten games, their poor mid-season run ultimately proved to be too much to recover from, and they finished five points adrift of [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]], who occupied the final Champions League spot.\n\nAfter the end of the season, chairman [[Peter Ridsdale]] decided that enough was enough and sacked O'Leary after four years and tens of millions of pounds in new signings had failed to translate into silverware; many also believe the infamous book  \"Leeds United: On Trial\", written by O'Leary himself, destroyed morale in the dressing-room and accelerated his departure from the club. In came former England manager [[Terry Venables]] as his successor.\n\nPlans were unveiled on 5 September for a new 50,000-seat stadium at [[Skelton, West Yorkshire|Skelton]] to replace [[Elland Road]], with Ridsdale hoping to have it ready by the summer of 2004. In fact, Ridsdale was aware that millions of pounds had been staked on Champions League qualification - by not qualifying in successive years, the club was heading for financial meltdown.\n==Final

It was the 21st&nbsp;[[FIFA World Cup]], a worldwide football tournament held once every four years. It was the 11th&nbsp;time the championships had been held in Europe, and the first time they were held in [[Eastern Europe]]. At an estimated cost of over $14.2&nbsp;billion, it was the most expensive World Cup to date.\n\nThe finals involved 32 teams, of which 31 came through [[2018 FIFA World Cup qualification|qualifying competitions]], while as the host nation [[Russia national football team|Russia]] qualified automatically. Of the 32, 20 had also appeared in the [[2014 FIFA World Cup|2014 event]], while both [[Iceland national football team|Iceland]] and [[Panama national football team|Panama]] made their first appearances at the World Cup. 64 matches were played in 12 venues across 11 cities. [[Germany national football team|Germany]], the defending champions, were eliminated in the group stage. Host nation Russia was eliminated in the quarter-finals. In the [[2018 FIFA World Cup Final|final]], [[France national football team|France]] played [[Croatia national football team|Croatia]] on 15&nbsp;July at the [[Luzhniki Stadium]] in [[Moscow]]. France won the match 4\u20132 to claim their second World Cup.\n\nThe event featured a number of accolades. Croatian player [[Luka Modri\u0107]] was voted the tournament's best player winning the Golden Ball. England's [[Harry Kane]] scored the most goals during the tournament with six. [[Thibaut Courtois]] won the Golden Glove awarded to the [[goalkeeper]] with the most [[clean sheet]]s.

Although the report was never published, FIFA released a 42-page summary of its findings as determined by German judge [[Hans-Joachim Eckert]]. Eckert's summary cleared Russia and Qatar of any wrongdoing, but was denounced by critics as a whitewash.<ref name=\"APfire\" /> Garcia criticised the summary as being \"materially incomplete\" with \"erroneous representations of the facts and conclusions\", and appealed to FIFA's Appeal Committee.<ref name=\"K7Ghy\" /><ref name=\"WhatNow\" /> The committee declined to hear his appeal, so Garcia resigned in protest of FIFA's conduct, citing a \"lack of leadership\" and lack of confidence in the independence of Eckert.<ref name=\"0U57X\" />\n\nOn 3 June 2015, the [[FBI]] confirmed that the federal authorities were investigating the bidding and awarding processes for the 2018 and [[2022 FIFA World Cup|2022 World Cups]].<ref name=\"r8Bz2\" /><ref name=\"lgRB1\" /> In an interview published on 7 June 2015, [[Domenico Scala (manager)|Domenico Scala]], the head of FIFA's Audit And Compliance Committee, stated that \"should there be evidence that the awards to Qatar and Russia came only because of bought votes, then the awards could be cancelled\".<ref name=\"BBC News\" /><ref name=\"Owen Gibson\" /> [[Prince William, Duke of Cambridge]] and former British Prime Minister [[David Cameron]] attended a meeting with FIFA vice-president [[Chung Mong-joon]] in which a vote-trading deal for the right to host the 2018 World Cup in [[England 2018 FIFA World Cup bid|England]] was discussed.<ref name=\"SNVa0\" /><ref name=\"oJlN3\" />\n\n===Response to Skripal poisoning===\nIn response to the March 2018 [[poisoning of Sergei and Yulia Skripal]], British Prime Minister [[Theresa May]] announced that no British ministers or members of the royal family would attend the World Cup, and issued a warning to any travelling England fans.<ref name=\"AypwF\" /> Iceland diplomatically boycotted the World Cup.<ref name=\"1CS7B\" /> Russia responded to the comments from the UK Parliament claiming that \"the west are trying to deny Russia the World Cup\".<ref name=\"aXQLQ\" /> The [[Russian Foreign Ministry]] denounced [[Boris Johnson]]'s statements that compared the event to the [[1936 Summer Olympics|1936 Olympics]] held in [[Nazi Germany]] as \"poisoned with venom of hate, unprofessionalism and boorishness\" and \"unacceptable and unworthy\" parallel towards Russia, a \"nation that [[World War II casualties of the Soviet Union|lost millions of lives in fighting Nazism]]\".<ref name=\"0aw0J\" />\n\nThe British [[Foreign Office]] and MPs had repeatedly warned English football fans and \"people of Asian or Afro-Caribbean descent\" travelling to Russia of \"racist or homophobic intimidation, hooligan violence and anti-British hostility\".<ref name=\"qKSXy\" /><ref name=\"WNLwc\" /> English football fans who have travelled have said they have received a warm welcome from ordinary citizens after arriving in Russia.<ref name=\"sOFhm\" /><ref name=\"XWjIW\" />\n\n==Critical reception==\n[[File:2018 FIFA World Cup opening ceremony (2018-06-14) 11.jpg|thumb|Russia received widespread praise as World Cup hosts.

After having tested the technology at limited matches of the [[2013 FIFA Confederations Cup]],<ref name=\"wPguj\" /> and the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]] (via private tests and public viewings in the host city of [[Rio de Janeiro]]),<ref name=\"kVsNi\" /> the 2018 World Cup was the first World Cup in which all matches were produced in [[4K resolution|4K]] [[Ultra-high-definition television|ultra high definition]]. Host Broadcast Services (HBS) stated that at least 75% of the broadcast cut on each match would come from 4K cameras (covering the majority of main angles), with instant replays and some camera angles being upconverted from [[1080p]] high definition sources with limited degradation in quality. These broadcasts were made available from selected rightsholders and television providers.<ref name=\"TCu23\" /><ref name=\"0j6eE\" /><ref name=\"6j06c\" />\n\nIn February 2018, Ukrainian rightsholder [[UA:PBC]] stated that it would not broadcast the World Cup. This came in the wake of growing boycotts of the tournament among the [[Football Federation of Ukraine]] and sports minister [[Ihor Zhdanov]].<ref name=\"Xv82A\" /><ref name=\"0gvp3\" /> Additionally, the Football Federation of Ukraine refused to accredit journalists for the World Cup and waived their quota of tickets.<ref name=\"MLa57\" /> However, the Ukrainian state TV still broadcast the World Cup, and more than 4 million Ukrainians watched the opening match.<ref name=\"YqvyD\" />\n\nBroadcast rights to the tournament in the Middle East were hampered by an ongoing [[2017\u201318 Qatar diplomatic crisis|diplomatic crisis in Qatar]], which saw Bahrain, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates cut diplomatic ties with Qatar\u2014the home country of FIFA's Middle East and Africa rightsholder [[beIN Sports]]\u2014in June 2017, over its [[Qatar and state-sponsored terrorism|alleged state support of terrorist groups]]. On 2 June 2018, beIN pulled its channels from [[Du (company)|Du]] and [[Etisalat]], but with service to the latter restored later that day. Etisalat subsequently announced that it would air the World Cup in the UAE, and continue to offer beIN normally and without interruptions.<ref name=\"y5Kr4\" /><ref name=\"mvmPW\" /><ref name=\"jyl42\" /> In Saudi Arabia, beIN was banned from doing business; as a result, its channels and other content have been widely and illegally repackaged by a broadcaster identifying itself as \"[[beoutQ]]\". While FIFA attempted to indirectly negotiate the sale of a package consisting of Saudi matches and the final, they were unable to do so. On 12 July 2018, FIFA stated that it had \"engaged counsel to take legal action in Saudi Arabia and is working alongside other sports rights owners that have also been affected to protect its interests.\"<ref name=\"NIzbW\" /><ref name=\"6N9LV\" />\n\nIn the United States, the 2018 World Cup was the first men's World Cup whose English rights were held by [[Fox Sports (United States)|Fox Sports]], and Spanish rights held by [[Telemundo Deportes|Telemundo]]. The elimination of the United States in qualifying led to concerns that US interest and viewership of this World Cup would be reduced, noting that \"casual\" viewers of U.S. matches caused them to peak at 16.5&nbsp;million viewers in 2014, and how much Fox paid for the rights. During a launch event prior to the elimination, Fox stated that it had planned to place a secondary focus on the Mexican team in its coverage to take advantage of their popularity among [[Hispanic and Latino Americans]]. Fox stated that it was still committed to broadcasting a significant amount of coverage for the tournament.<ref name=\"lJrJH\" /><ref name=\"Oo1hn\" /><ref name=\"1M4WS\" /> Viewership was down overall over 2014, additionally citing match scheduling that was not as favourable to viewers in the Americas than 2014 (with many matches airing in the morning hours, although Telemundo's broadcast of the Mexico-Sweden Group F match was announced as being its most-watched weekday [[Daytime television|daytime]] program in network history).<ref name=\"wx1ZL\" /><ref name=\"UFMpG\" />\n\nUnlike previous tournaments, where the rights were bundled with those of South Korea, [[Korean Central Television]] acquired rights to the 2018 World Cup within North Korea. Broadcasts only began with the round of 16, and matches were tape delayed and edited for time. In addition, matches involving Japan were excluded from the broadcasts, due to [[Japan\u2013North Korea relations|strained relations and campaigns against the country]].<ref name=\"iscoP\"

football|football]] tournament contested by [[List of men's national association football teams|men's national teams]] and took place between 14&nbsp;June and 15&nbsp;July 2018 in Russia. It was the 21st&nbsp;[[FIFA World Cup]], a worldwide football tournament held once every four years. It was the 11th&nbsp;time the championships had been held in Europe, and the first time they were held in [[Eastern Europe]]. At an estimated cost of over $14.2&nbsp;billion, it was the most expensive World Cup to date.\n\nThe finals involved 32 teams, of which 31 came through [[2018 FIFA World Cup qualification|qualifying competitions]], while as the host nation [[Russia national football team|Russia]] qualified automatically. Of the 32, 20 had also appeared in the [[2014 FIFA World Cup|2014 event]], while both [[Iceland national football team|Iceland]] and [[Panama national football team|Panama]] made their first appearances at the World Cup. 64 matches were played in 12 venues across 11 cities. [[Germany national football team|Germany]], the defending champions, were eliminated in the group stage. Host nation Russia was eliminated in the quarter-finals. In the [[2018 FIFA World Cup Final|final]], [[France national football team|France]] played [[Croatia national football team|Croatia]] on 15&nbsp;July at the [[Luzhniki Stadium]] in [[Moscow]]. France won the match 4\u20132 to claim their second World Cup.\n\nThe event featured a number of accolades. Croatian player [[Luka Modri\u0107]] was voted the tournament's best player winning the Golden Ball. England's [[Harry Kane]] scored the most goals during the tournament with six. [[Thibaut Courtois]] won the Golden Glove awarded to the [[goalkeeper]] with the most [[clean sheet]]s. The event was praised for the quality of football but criticised for being a distraction from [[Doping in Russia|doping allegations]] and public relations within Russia. It has been estimated that more than three million people attended games during the tournament.\n\n==Host selection==\n{{Main|Russia 2018 FIFA World Cup bid}}\n[[File:Russia 2018 World Cup.jpeg|thumb|Russian bid personnel celebrate the awarding of the 2018 World Cup to Russia on 2 December 2010.]]\n[[File:Vladimir Putin FIFA World Cup Trophy Tour kick-off ceremony.jpg|thumb|President [[Vladimir Putin]] holding the [[FIFA World Cup Trophy]] at a pre-tournament ceremony in Moscow on 9&nbsp;September 2017]]\n[[File:Russia 100 Rubles 2018 FIFA World Cup.jpg|thumb|upright|The 100-[[Russian ruble|ruble]] commemorative banknote celebrates the 2018 FIFA World Cup.

As such, there were eventually four bids for the 2018 FIFA World Cup, two of which were joint bids: England, Russia, Netherlands/Belgium, and Portugal/Spain.<ref name=\"xBccj\" />\n\nThe 22-member [[FIFA Council|FIFA Executive Committee]] convened in [[Z\u00fcrich]] on 2&nbsp;December 2010 to vote to select the hosts of both tournaments.<ref name=\"WFQKr\" /> Russia won the right to be the 2018 host in the second round of voting. The Portugal/Spain bid came second, and that from Belgium/Netherlands third. England, which was bidding to host its second tournament, was eliminated in the first round.<ref name=\"kKxiB\" />\n\nThe voting results were:<ref name=\"xBccj\" />\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|+2018 FIFA bidding (majority 12 votes)\n!rowspan=2|Bidders\n!colspan=2|Votes\n|-\n!Round 1\n!Round 2\n|-\n|'''Russia'''\n|style=\"text-align:center\"|9\n|{{yes|13}}\n|-\n|Portugal / Spain\n|style=\"text-align:center\"|7\n|style=\"text-align:center\"|7\n|-\n|Belgium / Netherlands\n|style=\"text-align:center\"|4\n|style=\"text-align:center\"|2\n|-\n|England\n|style=\"text-align:center\"|2\n|{{no result|Eliminated}}\n|}\n\n===Criticism===\nThe English [[Football Association]] (FA) and others raised concerns over bribery on the part of the Russian team and corruption by FIFA members. They claimed that four members of the executive committee had requested bribes to vote for England, and [[Sepp Blatter]] had said it had already been arranged before the vote that Russia would win.<ref name=\"sRBCC\" /> The 2014 [[Garcia Report]], an internal investigation led by [[Michael J. Garcia]], was withheld from public release by [[Hans-Joachim Eckert]], FIFA's head of adjudication on ethical matters. Eckert released a shorter revised summary instead, and his (and therefore FIFA's) reluctance to publish the full report caused Garcia to resign in protest.<ref name=\"3BhYq\" /> Because of the controversy, the FA refused to accept Eckert's absolving Russia from blame. [[Greg Dyke]] called for a re-examination of the affair and [[David Bernstein (executive)|David Bernstein]] called for a boycott of the World Cup.<ref name=\"zt9ZM\" /><ref name=\"2xMiJ\" />\n\n==Teams==\n\n===Qualification===\n{{Main|2018 FIFA World Cup qualification}}\nFor the first time in the history of the FIFA World Cup, all eligible nations\u2014the 209 [[List of FIFA Member Associations|FIFA member associations]] except automatically qualified hosts Russia\u2014applied to enter the qualifying process.<ref name=\"riaYh\" /> [[Zimbabwe national football team|Zimbabwe]] and [[Indonesia national football team|Indonesia]] were later disqualified before playing their first matches,<ref name=\"zimbabwe\" /><ref name=\"indonesia\" /> while [[Gibraltar national football team|Gibraltar]] and [[Kosovo national football team|Kosovo]], who joined FIFA on 13&nbsp;May 2016 after the qualifying draw but before European qualifying had begun, also entered the competition.<ref name=\"k8fRX\" /> Places in the tournament were allocated to continental confederations, with the allocation unchanged from the 2014 World Cup.<ref name=\"fifa20150320\" /><ref name=\"hstri\" /> The first qualification game, between [[Timor-Leste national football team|Timor-Leste]] and [[Mongolia national football team|Mongolia]], began in [[Dili]] on 12&nbsp;March 2015 as part of the [[2018 FIFA World Cup qualification (AFC)|AFC's qualification]],<ref name=\"45Ip9\" /> and the main qualifying draw took place at the [[Konstantinovsky Palace]] in [[Strelna]], [[Saint Petersburg]], on 25&nbsp;July 2015.<ref name=\"L1urj\" /><ref name=\"crlmz\" /><ref name=\"lzli9\" /><ref name=\"press release\" />\n\nOf the 32&nbsp;nations qualified to play at the 2018 FIFA World Cup, 20&nbsp;countries competed at the previous tournament in [[2014 FIFA World Cup|2014]].

It was the first time three [[Nordic countries]] (Denmark, Iceland and Sweden) and four [[Arab world|Arab nations]] (Egypt, Morocco, Saudi Arabia and Tunisia) qualified for the World Cup.<ref name=\"vviY2\" />\n\nNotable teams that failed to qualify included: four-time champions [[Italy national football team|Italy]] (for the first time since 1958), who were knocked out in a qualification play-off by quarter-finalists Sweden, and three-time runners-up and third placed in 2014 the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]] (for the first time since 2002).

/>\n\nVAR operations for all games were operated from a single headquarters in Moscow, which received live video of the games and were in radio contact with the on-field referees.<ref name=\":0\" /> Systems were in place for communicating VAR-related information to broadcasters and visuals on stadiums' large screens were used for the fans in attendance.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nVAR had a significant impact on several games.<ref name=\"nh0b0\" /> On 15&nbsp;June 2018, [[Diego Costa]]'s goal against Portugal became the first World Cup goal based on a VAR decision;<ref name=\"isPIb\" /> the first penalty as a result of a VAR decision was awarded to France in their match against Australia on 16&nbsp;June and resulted in a goal by [[Antoine Griezmann]].<ref name=\"iQyFC\" /> A record number of penalties were awarded in the tournament, a phenomenon partially attributed to VAR.<ref name=\"zeD2b\" /> Overall, the new technology was both praised and criticised by commentators.<ref name=\"neijv\" /> FIFA declared the implementation of VAR a success after the first week of competition.<ref name=\"swBxZ\" />\n\n==Venues==\nRussia proposed the following host cities: [[Kaliningrad]], [[Kazan]], [[Krasnodar]], [[Moscow]], [[Nizhny Novgorod]], [[Rostov-on-Don]], [[Saint Petersburg]], [[Samara]], [[Saransk]], [[Sochi]], [[Volgograd]], [[Yaroslavl]], and [[Yekaterinburg]].<ref name=\"b9r6N\" /> Each city was located in [[European Russia]], except [[Yekaterinburg]],<ref name=\"S3sSt\" /> which is located very close to the Europe-Asia border, to reduce travel time for the teams in the huge country. The bid evaluation report stated: \"The Russian bid proposes 13 host cities and 16 stadiums, thus exceeding FIFA's minimum requirement. Three of the 16 stadiums would be renovated, and 13 would be newly constructed.\"<ref name=\"Z1hqZ\" />\n\nIn October 2011, Russia reduced the number of stadiums from 16 to 14. Construction of the proposed [[Podolsk]] stadium in the Moscow region was cancelled by the regional government. Also, in the capital, [[Otkritie Arena]] was competing with [[VTB Arena|Dynamo Stadium]] over which would be constructed first.<ref name=\"8DESn\" />{{dead link|date=March 2020}}\n\nThe final choice of host cities was announced on 29&nbsp;September 2012. The number of cities was reduced further to 11 and the number of stadiums to 12 as Krasnodar and Yaroslavl were dropped from the final list. Of the 12 stadiums used for the tournament, three (Luzhniki, Yekaterinburg and Sochi) had been extensively renovated and the other nine were brand new; $11.8&nbsp;billion was spent on hosting the tournament.<ref name=\"VKrDx\" />\n\nSepp Blatter had said in July 2014 that, given the concerns over the completion of venues in Russia, the number of venues for the tournament may be reduced from 12 to 10.<ref name=\"Sy4OR\" /> He also said, \"We are not going to be in a situation, as is the case of one, two or even three stadiums [[2010 FIFA World Cup|in South Africa]], where it is a problem of what you do with these stadiums\".<ref name=\"saakov\" />\n[[File:EstadioCentral2017-01-26.jpg|thumb|Reconstruction of the Yekaterinburg Central Stadium in January 2017]] \nIn October 2014, on their first official visit to Russia, FIFA's inspection committee and its head, Chris Unger, visited St. Petersburg, Sochi, Kazan and both Moscow venues. They were satisfied with the progress.<ref name=\"u01d8\" /> On 8&nbsp;October 2015, FIFA and the local organising committee agreed on the official names of the stadiums to be used during the tournament.<ref name=\"AL037\" /> Of the twelve venues, the Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow and the Saint Petersburg Stadium\u2014the two largest stadiums in Russia\u2014were used most; both hosted seven matches. Sochi, Kazan, Nizhny Novgorod and Samara each hosted six matches, including one quarter-final match each, while the Spartak Stadium in Moscow and Rostov-on-Don hosted five matches, including one round-of-16 match each. Volgograd, Kaliningrad, Yekaterinburg and Saransk each hosted four matches, but did not host any knockout stage games.\n\n===Stadiums===\n[[File:Bel-Tun (26).jpg|thumb|{{Center|Exterior of Otkrytie Arena}}{{Center| in Moscow}}]]\nTwelve stadiums in eleven Russian cities were built or renovated for the FIFA World Cup.

The stadium in Saransk was scheduled to be commissioned in 2012 in time for the opening of the all-Russian [[Spartakiad]], but the plan was revised. The opening was rescheduled to 2017. The arena hosted its first match on 21&nbsp;April 2018.\n* Sochi: Fisht Stadium (renovated). This stadium hosted the opening and closing ceremonies of the [[2014 Winter Olympics]]. Afterwards, it was renovated in preparation for the 2017 FIFA Confederations Cup and the 2018 World Cup.\n* Volgograd: Volgograd Arena (new). The main Volgograd arena was built on the demolished [[Central Stadium (Volgograd)|Central Stadium]] site, at the foot of the [[Mamayev Kurgan]] memorial complex. It was commissioned on 3&nbsp;April 2018.<ref name=\"j2Lhd\" />\n* Yekaterinburg: Ekaterinburg Arena (renovated). The Central Stadium of Yekaterinburg had been renovated for the FIFA World Cup.

Although the report was never published, FIFA released a 42-page summary of its findings as determined by German judge [[Hans-Joachim Eckert]]. Eckert's summary cleared Russia and Qatar of any wrongdoing, but was denounced by critics as a whitewash.<ref name=\"APfire\" /> Garcia criticised the summary as being \"materially incomplete\" with \"erroneous representations of the facts and conclusions\", and appealed to FIFA's Appeal Committee.<ref name=\"K7Ghy\" /><ref name=\"WhatNow\" /> The committee declined to hear his appeal, so Garcia resigned in protest of FIFA's conduct, citing a \"lack of leadership\" and lack of confidence in the independence of Eckert.<ref name=\"0U57X\" />\n\nOn 3 June 2015, the [[FBI]] confirmed that the federal authorities were investigating the bidding and awarding processes for the 2018 and [[2022 FIFA World Cup|2022 World Cups]].<ref name=\"r8Bz2\" /><ref name=\"lgRB1\" /> In an interview published on 7 June 2015, [[Domenico Scala (manager)|Domenico Scala]], the head of FIFA's Audit And Compliance Committee, stated that \"should there be evidence that the awards to Qatar and Russia came only because of bought votes, then the awards could be cancelled\".<ref name=\"BBC News\" /><ref name=\"Owen Gibson\" /> [[Prince William, Duke of Cambridge]] and former British Prime Minister [[David Cameron]] attended a meeting with FIFA vice-president [[Chung Mong-joon]] in which a vote-trading deal for the right to host the 2018 World Cup in [[England 2018 FIFA World Cup bid|England]] was discussed.<ref name=\"SNVa0\" /><ref name=\"oJlN3\" />\n\n===Response to Skripal poisoning===\nIn response to the March 2018 [[poisoning of Sergei and Yulia Skripal]], British Prime Minister [[Theresa May]] announced that no British ministers or members of the royal family would attend the World Cup, and issued a warning to any travelling England fans.<ref name=\"AypwF\" /> Iceland diplomatically boycotted the World Cup.<ref name=\"1CS7B\" /> Russia responded to the comments from the UK Parliament claiming that \"the west are trying to deny Russia the World Cup\".<ref name=\"aXQLQ\" /> The [[Russian Foreign Ministry]] denounced [[Boris Johnson]]'s statements that compared the event to the [[1936 Summer Olympics|1936 Olympics]] held in [[Nazi Germany]] as \"poisoned with venom of hate, unprofessionalism and boorishness\" and \"unacceptable and unworthy\" parallel towards Russia, a \"nation that [[World War II casualties of the Soviet Union|lost millions of lives in fighting Nazism]]\".<ref name=\"0aw0J\" />\n\nThe British [[Foreign Office]] and MPs had repeatedly warned English football fans and \"people of Asian or Afro-Caribbean descent\" travelling to Russia of \"racist or homophobic intimidation, hooligan violence and anti-British hostility\".<ref name=\"qKSXy\" /><ref name=\"WNLwc\" /> English football fans who have travelled have said they have received a warm welcome from ordinary citizens after arriving in Russia.<ref name=\"sOFhm\" /><ref name=\"XWjIW\" />\n\n==Critical reception==\n[[File:2018 FIFA World Cup opening ceremony (2018-06-14) 11.jpg|thumb|Russia received widespread praise as World Cup hosts.

After having tested the technology at limited matches of the [[2013 FIFA Confederations Cup]],<ref name=\"wPguj\" /> and the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]] (via private tests and public viewings in the host city of [[Rio de Janeiro]]),<ref name=\"kVsNi\" /> the 2018 World Cup was the first World Cup in which all matches were produced in [[4K resolution|4K]] [[Ultra-high-definition television|ultra high definition]]. Host Broadcast Services (HBS) stated that at least 75% of the broadcast cut on each match would come from 4K cameras (covering the majority of main angles), with instant replays and some camera angles being upconverted from [[1080p]] high definition sources with limited degradation in quality. These broadcasts were made available from selected rightsholders and television providers.<ref name=\"TCu23\" /><ref name=\"0j6eE\" /><ref name=\"6j06c\" />\n\nIn February 2018, Ukrainian rightsholder [[UA:PBC]] stated that it would not broadcast the World Cup. This came in the wake of growing boycotts of the tournament among the [[Football Federation of Ukraine]] and sports minister [[Ihor Zhdanov]].<ref name=\"Xv82A\" /><ref name=\"0gvp3\" /> Additionally, the Football Federation of Ukraine refused to accredit journalists for the World Cup and waived their quota of tickets.<ref name=\"MLa57\" /> However, the Ukrainian state TV still broadcast the World Cup, and more than 4 million Ukrainians watched the opening match.<ref name=\"YqvyD\" />\n\nBroadcast rights to the tournament in the Middle East were hampered by an ongoing [[2017\u201318 Qatar diplomatic crisis|diplomatic crisis in Qatar]], which saw Bahrain, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates cut diplomatic ties with Qatar\u2014the home country of FIFA's Middle East and Africa rightsholder [[beIN Sports]]\u2014in June 2017, over its [[Qatar and state-sponsored terrorism|alleged state support of terrorist groups]]. On 2 June 2018, beIN pulled its channels from [[Du (company)|Du]] and [[Etisalat]], but with service to the latter restored later that day. Etisalat subsequently announced that it would air the World Cup in the UAE, and continue to offer beIN normally and without interruptions.<ref name=\"y5Kr4\" /><ref name=\"mvmPW\" /><ref name=\"jyl42\" /> In Saudi Arabia, beIN was banned from doing business; as a result, its channels and other content have been widely and illegally repackaged by a broadcaster identifying itself as \"[[beoutQ]]\". While FIFA attempted to indirectly negotiate the sale of a package consisting of Saudi matches and the final, they were unable to do so. On 12 July 2018, FIFA stated that it had \"engaged counsel to take legal action in Saudi Arabia and is working alongside other sports rights owners that have also been affected to protect its interests.\"<ref name=\"NIzbW\" /><ref name=\"6N9LV\" />\n\nIn the United States, the 2018 World Cup was the first men's World Cup whose English rights were held by [[Fox Sports (United States)|Fox Sports]], and Spanish rights held by [[Telemundo Deportes|Telemundo]]. The elimination of the United States in qualifying led to concerns that US interest and viewership of this World Cup would be reduced, noting that \"casual\" viewers of U.S. matches caused them to peak at 16.5&nbsp;million viewers in 2014, and how much Fox paid for the rights. During a launch event prior to the elimination, Fox stated that it had planned to place a secondary focus on the Mexican team in its coverage to take advantage of their popularity among [[Hispanic and Latino Americans]]. Fox stated that it was still committed to broadcasting a significant amount of coverage for the tournament.<ref name=\"lJrJH\" /><ref name=\"Oo1hn\" /><ref name=\"1M4WS\" /> Viewership was down overall over 2014, additionally citing match scheduling that was not as favourable to viewers in the Americas than 2014 (with many matches airing in the morning hours, although Telemundo's broadcast of the Mexico-Sweden Group F match was announced as being its most-watched weekday [[Daytime television|daytime]] program in network history).<ref name=\"wx1ZL\" /><ref name=\"UFMpG\" />\n\nUnlike previous tournaments, where the rights were bundled with those of South Korea, [[Korean Central Television]] acquired rights to the 2018 World Cup within North Korea. Broadcasts only began with the round of 16, and matches were tape delayed and edited for time. In addition, matches involving Japan were excluded from the broadcasts, due to [[Japan\u2013North Korea relations|strained relations and campaigns against the country]].<ref name=\"iscoP\"

A generation later, Panjabi's parents migrated to West Africa, where Panjabi was born and raised in [[Monrovia]], [[Liberia]]. After [[First Liberian Civil War|civil war broke out in Liberia in 1989]], Panjabi, at age nine, and his family fled on a rescue cargo plane to [[Sierra Leone]] and eventually sought asylum in the United States, resettling initially with a host family in High Point, [[North Carolina]].\n\nPanjabi graduated with bachelor and medical degrees from the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill|University of North Carolina School at Chapel Hill]] and received a Masters of Public Health from the [[Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health]]. He was a Clinical Fellow at Harvard Medical School, and trained in [[internal medicine]] and [[primary care]] at the [[Massachusetts General Hospital]].\n\nPanjabi returned to Liberia in 2005, as a medical student.\n\n== Work ==\n\n=== Last Mile Health ===\n\nPanjabi is best known as the co-founder and CEO of Last Mile Health,<ref> https://lastmilehealth.org/ </ref> a non-profit organisation working to save lives in the world's most remote communities.

Through effective country programs and global initiatives, Last Mile Health partners with governments to support teams of community and frontline health workers who bring high-quality primary healthcare within reach of millions of rural people.<ref>https://lastmilehealth.org/four-year-strategic-plan/ </ref> Community Health Workers [CHWs] are people with a middle or high school level education who are employed in their own villages and given training, medicines and smartphones enabling them to bring health care to the doorsteps of their neighbors. When a patient has a condition CHWs can\u2019t care for, they work with frontline health workers, including outreach nurses and midwives, to refer patients to networks of clinics and hospitals.<ref name=\"time.com3\"> Panjabi R.

The workers in this program carry out nearly 1/3 of all confirmed malaria diagnoses in the country, have identified over 4,000 potential epidemic events, improved vaccination coverage, improved skill birth attendance, and increased the rate of children receiving medical care by over 50% in Liberia's most remote communities.<ref>https://time.com/5709344/governments-should-pay-community-health-workers/</ref> As of 2019, through service, research and advocacy efforts, Last Mile Health has supported local partners working to strengthen rural frontline and community health workforces in nearly 10 countries across three continents.<ref> 2019-annual-report.lastmilehealth.org </ref>\n\nIn 2017, Panjabi and Last Mile Health received the $1 million TED Prize to launch the Community Health Academy, a global platform leveraging the power of digital technology to support countries to modernize the training of community health workers and health systems leaders.<ref name=\"ted.com\">https://www.ted.com/talks/raj_panjabi_no_one_should_die_because_they_live_too_far_from_a_doctor</ref> In collaboration with several partners and governments, the Community Health Academy has launched online and mobile courses for frontline health leaders and workers seeking to strengthen primary health care at the community level.

The study indicated that, in one of Liberia's most remote districts, professionalized CHWs coached by nurses significantly improved access to care from qualified providers for children suffering from [[diarrhea]], [[malaria]], and [[acute respiratory infection]] \u2013 increasing by 60.1, 30.6 and 51.2 percentage points, respectively. Furthermore, CHWs significantly increased the rates of pregnant women undergoing clinic-based births with a skilled provider to 84.0 percent. In addition, despite the [[West African Ebola virus epidemic|Ebola virus disease outbreak]], which caused substantial declines in health-care utilization in other regions of the country, the study showed increases in health-care use from formal providers for [[fever]], acute respiratory infection, and diarrhea among children and facility-based delivery among pregnant women. The study noted:<blockquote>practices from this programme are being scaled up to over 240 remote communities in adjacent Rivercess County. Furthermore, several of the programme's features, such as contracts and cash payments, ensuring a CHW-to-population ratio of 1:350, targeting of services to remote communities and field-based supervision, have helped to inform the design of Liberia's National Community Health Assistant Program.<ref name=\":0\" /></blockquote>An editorial on barriers to universal health coverage co-authored by [[Margaret Chan]], the Director-General of the [[World Health Organization]], cited the 2017 study about Last Mile Health's work in Liberia.

The workers in this program carry out nearly 1/3 of all confirmed malaria diagnoses in the country, have identified over 4,000 potential epidemic events, improved vaccination coverage, improved skill birth attendance, and increased the rate of children receiving medical care by over 50% in Liberia's most remote communities.<ref>https://time.com/5709344/governments-should-pay-community-health-workers/</ref> As of 2019, through service, research and advocacy efforts, Last Mile Health has supported local partners working to strengthen rural frontline and community health workforces in nearly 10 countries across three continents.<ref> 2019-annual-report.lastmilehealth.org </ref>\n\nIn 2017, Panjabi and Last Mile Health received the $1 million TED Prize to launch the Community Health Academy, a global platform leveraging the power of digital technology to support countries to modernize the training of community health workers and health systems leaders.<ref name=\"ted.com\">https://www.ted.com/talks/raj_panjabi_no_one_should_die_because_they_live_too_far_from_a_doctor</ref> In collaboration with several partners and governments, the Community Health Academy has launched online and mobile courses for frontline health leaders and workers seeking to strengthen primary health care at the community level.

Furthermore, CHWs significantly increased the rates of pregnant women undergoing clinic-based births with a skilled provider to 84.0 percent. In addition, despite the [[West African Ebola virus epidemic|Ebola virus disease outbreak]], which caused substantial declines in health-care utilization in other regions of the country, the study showed increases in health-care use from formal providers for [[fever]], acute respiratory infection, and diarrhea among children and facility-based delivery among pregnant women. The study noted:<blockquote>practices from this programme are being scaled up to over 240 remote communities in adjacent Rivercess County. Furthermore, several of the programme's features, such as contracts and cash payments, ensuring a CHW-to-population ratio of 1:350, targeting of services to remote communities and field-based supervision, have helped to inform the design of Liberia's National Community Health Assistant Program.<ref name=\":0\" /></blockquote>An editorial on barriers to universal health coverage co-authored by [[Margaret Chan]], the Director-General of the [[World Health Organization]], cited the 2017 study about Last Mile Health's work in Liberia.

He was born in Manitoba, Canada, and died at the age of 82.\n\n==Early life==\nStefansson, born William Stephenson, was born at [[Rural Municipality of Gimli|Arnes, Manitoba]], Canada, in 1879. His parents had emigrated from [[Iceland]] to Manitoba two years earlier. After losing two children during a period of devastating flooding, the family moved to [[North Dakota]] in 1880.\n\nHe was educated at the universities [[University of North Dakota|of North Dakota]] and [[University of Iowa|of Iowa]] ([[Bachelor of Arts|A.B.]], 1903). During his college years, in 1899, he changed his name to Vilhjalmur Stefansson. He studied [[anthropology]] at the graduate school of [[Harvard University]], where for two years he was an instructor.\n\n==Early explorations==\nIn 1904 and 1905, Stefansson did archaeological research in [[Iceland]]. Recruited by [[Ejnar Mikkelsen]] and [[Ernest de Koven Leffingwell]] for their Anglo-American Polar Expedition, he lived with the [[Inuit]] of the [[Mackenzie River|Mackenzie Delta]] during the winter of 1906\u20131907, returning alone across country via the [[Porcupine River|Porcupine]] and [[Yukon River|Yukon]] Rivers. Under the auspices of the [[American Museum of Natural History]], [[New York City|New York]], he and Dr. [[Rudolph Martin Anderson|R. M. Anderson]] undertook the ethnological survey of the Central Arctic coasts of the shores of [[North America]] from 1908 to 1912.\n\nIn 1908, Stefansson made a decision that would affect the rest of his time in Alaska: he hired the [[Inuk]] guide [[Natkusiak]], who would remain with him as his primary guide for the rest of his Alaska expeditions.<ref>[http://pubs.aina.ucalgary.ca/arctic/Arctic45-1-90.pdf Natkusiak (ca. 1885\u20131947)], ''Arctic'' magazine, Vol. 45, No. 1 (March 1992), pp. 90\u201392.</ref> At the time he met Natkusiak, the Inuk guide was working for Capt. [[George Baker Leavitt, Sr.|George B. Leavitt]], a Massachusetts [[whaler|whaling ship]] captain and friend of Stefansson's who sometimes brought the Arctic explorer replenishments of supplies from the American Museum of Natural History.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=AE_P_XngIi0C&pg=PA48&lpg=PA48&dq=%22george+leavitt%22+narwhal&source=bl&ots=RulYvQQUSn&sig=VkQqCn5gK9RK6Rb4yRswvfvBCqA&hl=en&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=9&ct=result ''My Life with the Eskimo''], Vilhjalmur Stefansson, Reissued by Kessinger Publishing, 2004. {{ISBN|1-4179-2395-4}}</ref>\n\n[[Christian Klengenberg]] is first credited to have introduced the term \"[[Blond Eskimos|Blonde Eskimo]]\" to Stefansson just before Stefansson's visit to the Inuit inhabiting southwestern [[Victoria Island (Canada)|Victoria Island]], Canada, in 1910.

H.}}</ref> [[Adolphus Greely]] in 1912 first compiled the sightings recorded in earlier literature of blonde or fair haired Arctic natives and in 1912 published them in the ''[[National Geographic Magazine]]'' entitled \"The Origin of Stefansson's Blonde Eskimo\". Newspapers subsequently popularised the term \"Blonde Eskimo\", which caught more readers' attention despite Stefansson's preference for the term Copper Inuit. Stefansson later referenced Greely's work in his writings and the term \"Blonde Eskimo\" became applied to sightings of light haired [[Eskimo]]s from as early as the 17th century.<ref>''My Life with the Eskimo'', 1922, p. 199 (reprinted by Kessinger Publishing, 2004).</ref>\n\n==Loss of the ''Karluk'' and rescue of survivors==\n{{Further|Voyage of the Karluk}}\nStefansson organized and directed the [[Canadian Arctic Expedition 1913\u20131916]] to explore the regions west of [[Queen Elizabeth Islands|Parry Archipelago]] for the [[Government of Canada]]. Three ships, the ''[[HMCS Karluk|Karluk]]'', the ''Mary Sachs'', and the ''Alaska'' were employed.\n\nStefansson left the main ship, the ''Karluk'', when it became stuck in the ice in August/September 1913. Stefansson's explanation was that he and five other expedition members left to go hunting to provide fresh meat for the crew. However, William Laird McKinley and others left on the ship suspected that he left deliberately, anticipating that the ship would be carried off by moving ice, as indeed happened. The ship, with Captain [[Robert Bartlett (explorer)|Robert Bartlett]] of Newfoundland and 24 other expedition members aboard, drifted westward with the ice and was eventually crushed. It sank on January 11, 1914. Four men made their way to [[Herald Island (Arctic)|Herald Island]], but died there, possibly from carbon monoxide poisoning, before they could be rescued. Four other men, including [[Alistair Mackay]] who had been part of the Sir [[Ernest Shackleton]]'s [[British Antarctic Expedition, 1907\u201309|British Antarctic Expedition]], tried reaching [[Wrangel Island]] on their own but perished. The remaining members of the expedition, under command of Captain Bartlett, made their way to Wrangel Island where three died. Bartlett and his Inuk hunter Kataktovik made their way across sea ice to Siberia to get help. Remaining survivors were picked up by the American fishing [[schooner]] [[King & Winge (fishing schooner)|''King & Winge'']] and the [[United States Revenue Cutter Service]] [[Revenue cutter|cutter]] {{USRC|Bear}}.<ref>Newell, Gordon R., ed., ''H.W. McCurdy Maritime History of the Pacific Northwest'', at 242, Superior Publishing, Seattle, Washington, 1966.</ref>\n\nStefansson resumed his explorations by [[sledge]] over the [[Arctic Ocean]], here known as the [[Beaufort Sea]], leaving [[Collinson Point, Alaska|Collinson Point]], [[Alaska]] in April, 1914. A supporting sledge turned back {{convert|75|mi|abbr=on}} offshore, but he and two men continued onward on one sledge, living largely by his rifle on polar game for 96 days until his party reached the ''Mary Sachs'' in the autumn. Stefansson continued exploring until 1918.\n\n==Wrangel Island fiasco==\nIn 1921, he encouraged and planned an expedition for four young men to colonise [[Wrangel Island]] north of [[Siberia]], where the eleven survivors of the 22 men on the ''Karluk'' had lived from March to September 1914. Stefansson had designs for forming an exploration company that would be geared towards individuals interested in touring the Arctic island.\n\nStefansson originally wanted to claim Wrangel Island for the Canadian government. However, due to the dangerous outcome from his initial trip to the island, the government refused to assist with the expedition. He then wanted to claim the land for [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]] but the British government rejected this claim when it was made by the young men. The raising of the British flag on Wrangel Island, an acknowledged [[Russia]]n territory, caused an international incident.\n\nThe four young men, Frederick Maurer, E. Lorne Knight, and Milton Galle from the US, and Allan Crawford of Canada, were inexperienced and ill-equipped for the trip. All perished on the island or in an attempt to get help from Siberia across the frozen [[Chukchi Sea]]. The only survivors were an Inuk woman, [[Ada Blackjack]], whom the men had hired as a seamstress in [[Nome, Alaska]], and taken with them, and the expedition's cat, Vic. Ada Blackjack had taught herself survival skills and cared for the last man on the island, E. Lorne Knight, until he died of [[scurvy]]. Blackjack was rescued in 1923 after two years on Wrangel Island. Stefansson drew the ire of the public and the families for having sent such ill-equipped young men to Wrangel. His reputation was severely tainted by this disaster and that of the ''Karluk''.\n\n==Discoveries==\nStefansson's discoveries included new land (such as [[Brock Island|Brock]], [[Mackenzie King Island|Mackenzie King]], [[Borden Island|Borden]], [[Meighen Island|Meighen]], and [[Lougheed Island]]s)<ref name=Stefansson>{{cite book\n  | last = Stefansson\n  | first = Vilhjalmur\n  | title = The Friendly Arctic: The Story of Five Years in Polar Regions\n  | publisher = Macmillan\n  | year = 1922\n  | location = New York\n| url =https://archive.org/details/friendlyarctics01stefgoog}}</ref> and the edge of the [[continental shelf]]. His journeys and successes are among the marvels of [[Arctic exploration]]. He extended the discoveries of [[Francis Leopold McClintock]]. From April 1914 to June 1915 he lived on the [[Drift ice|ice pack]]. Stefansson continued his explorations leaving from [[Herschel Island]] on August 23, 1915.\n\nOn January 30, 1920, ''The Pioche Record'' reported that Icelandic explorer Vilhjalmur Stefansson discovered a lost cache from the [[McClintock Arctic expedition|1853 McClintock expedition]] on [[Melville Island (Northwest Territories and Nunavut)|Melville Island]]. Clothing and food from the cache was in excellent condition despite the harsh arctic conditions.{{sfn|''The Pioche Record'', January 30,|1920|p=3}}\n\nIn 1921, he was awarded the [[Gold Medal (RGS)|Founder's Gold Medal]] of the [[Royal Geographical Society]] for his explorations of the Arctic.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rgs.org/NR/rdonlyres/C5962519-882A-4C67-803D-0037308C756D/0/GoldMedallists18322011.pdf| title=List of Past Gold Medal Winners|publisher= Royal Geographical Society|accessdate = 24 August 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Later career==\nStefansson remained a well-known explorer for the rest of his life. Late in life, through his affiliation with [[Dartmouth College]] (he was Director of Polar Studies), he became a major figure in the establishment of the [[United States Army|US Army]]'s [[Cold Regions Research and Engineering Laboratory]] (CRREL) in [[Hanover, New Hampshire|Hanover]], [[New Hampshire]]. CRREL-supported research, often conducted in winter on the forbidding summit of [[Mount Washington (New Hampshire)|Mount Washington]], has been key to developing mat\u00e9riel and doctrine to support alpine conflict.\n\nStefansson joined [[the Explorers Club]] in 1908, four years after its founding. He later served as Club President twice: 1919\u20131922 and 1937\u20131939. In the all-male Club, the Board drew attention under Stefansson's reign when it put forth an amendment to its bylaws that read in 1938, \"A Woman's Roll of Honor shall be instituted to which the Board of Directors may name women of the United States and Canada in recognition of the noteworthy achievements and writings in the field of the Club's interests, primarily exploration.\"<ref name=\"Minutes 1938\">Minutes, Explorer's Club, 4 January 1938.</ref> Perhaps to comfort fellow members, the article added, \"This Woman's Roll of Honor shall be quite outside the Club's organisation but shall correspond in dignity to the Honorary Class of (male) members within it.\"<ref name=\"Minutes 1938\" /> His continued support of women in anthropology is demonstrated in his 1939\u20131941 mentorship of [[Gitel Steed]] as she undertook research on diet and subsistence for his two-volume ''Lives of the Hunters'', from which she began a dissertation on hunter-gatherer.\n\nWhile living in New York City, Stefansson was one of the regulars at [[Romany Marie]]'s [[Greenwich Village]] [[caf\u00e9]]s.<ref name=\"Biography\">Robert Shulman.

One of the organisations prominent in this campaign was the [[Organization for Jewish Colonization in Russia|American Committee for the Settlement of Jews in Birobidjan]], or Ambijan, formed in 1934. A tireless proponent of settlement in Birobidzhan, Stefansson appeared at countless Ambijan meetings, dinners, and rallies, and proved an invaluable resource. Ambijan produced a 50-page Year Book at the end of 1936, full of testimonials and letters of support. Among these was one from Stefansson, who was now also listed as a member of Ambijan's Board of Directors and Governors: \"The Birobidjan project seems to me to offer a most statesmanlike contribution to the problem of the rehabilitation of eastern and central European Jewry,\" he wrote.\n\nAmbijan's national conference in New York, November 25\u201326, 1944, pledged to raise $1 million to support refugees in [[Volgograd|Stalingrad]] and Birobidzhan. Prominent guests and speakers included New York Congressman [[Emanuel Celler]], Senator [[Elbert D. Thomas]] of [[Utah]], and Soviet ambassador [[Andrei Gromyko]]. A public dinner, attended by the delegates and their guests, was hosted by Vilhjalmur and spouse Evelyn Stefansson. Vilhjalmur was selected as one of two vice-presidents of the organisation.\n\nBut with the growing anti-Russian feeling in the country after [[World War II]], \"expos\u00e9s\" of Stefansson began to appear in the press. In August 1951, he was denounced as a [[Communism|Communist]] before a [[United States Senate Subcommittee on Internal Security|Senate Internal Security subcommittee]] by [[Louis F. Budenz]], a Communist-turned-Catholic. Perhaps Stefansson himself had by then some second thoughts about Ambijan, for his posthumously published autobiography made no mention of his work on its behalf. Nor, for that matter, did his otherwise very complete obituary in ''[[The New York Times]]'' of August 27, 1962.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Srebrnik | first1 = Henry | year = 1998 | title = The Radical 'Second Life' of Vilhjalmur Stefansson | url = | journal = Arctic | volume = 51 | issue = 1| pages = 58\u201360 | doi=10.14430/arctic1046}}</ref>\n\n==Advocacy of an exclusively meat diet==\nStefansson is also a figure of considerable interest in [[diet (nutrition)|diet]]ary circles, especially those with an interest in very [[low-carbohydrate diet]]s. Stefansson documented the fact that the [[Inuit diet]] consisted of about 90% meat and fish; Inuit would often go 6 to 9 months a year eating nothing but meat and fish\u2014what might nowadays be perceived to be a 'zerocarb' / [[no-carbohydrate diet]]. (The diet technically contains a very low amount of carbohydates as the fresh fish that the Inuit ate would have contained a small amount of glycogen.) He found that he and his fellow explorers of European, Negro, and South Sea Islands descent were also perfectly healthy on such a diet. \n\nSome years after his first experience with the Inuit (known as Eskimos in Stefansson's time), Dr. Stefansson returned to the Arctic with a colleague, Dr. Karsten Anderson, to carry out research for the American Museum of Natural History. They were supplied with every necessity including a year's supply of 'civilised' food. This they declined, electing instead to live off the land. In the end, the one-year project stretched to four years, during which time the two men ate only the meat they could kill and the fish they could catch in the Canadian Arctic. Neither of the two men suffered any adverse after-effects from their four-year experiment. It was evident to Stefansson, as it had been to [[William Banting]], that the body could function perfectly well, remain healthy, vigorous and slender if it used a diet in which as much food was eaten as the body required, only carbohydrate was restricted and the total number of calories was ignored.<ref name=\"Groves\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.second-opinions.co.uk/banting.html|title=WILLIAM BANTING: The Father of the Low-Carbohydrate Diet|last=Groves, PhD|first=Barry|year=2002|publisher=Second Opinions|accessdate=26 December 2007}}</ref>\n\nWhile there was considerable skepticism when Stefansson reported his findings about the viability of an exclusively meat diet, his claims have been borne out in later studies and analyses.<ref>Fediuk, Karen. 2000 [http://members.shaw.ca/karen.fediuk/VitaminCintheInuitdiet.pdf Vitamin C in the Inuit diet: past and present].

For the rest of an entire year, paid observers followed them to ensure dietary compliance.  The book ''The Unseen Power: Public Relations'' states that [[Pendleton Dudley|Pendelton Dudley]], once considered the \"dean of public relations\", convinced the [[American Meat Institute]] to fund this study.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Unseen Power: Public Relations|last=Cutlip|first=Scott|publisher=Routledge|year=1994|isbn=0805814655|location=London|pages=101|accessdate=}}</ref>\n\nThe results were published, and Anderson had developed [[glycosuria]] during this time, which is normally associated with untreated diabetes.  But unlike the pathology of diabetes, in this particular study, glucosuria was present in Anderson for 4 days and coincided only with the giving of a 100 gm of glucose for a tolerance test and with the first 3 days of his pneumonia, where he received fluids and a diet rich in carbohydrate.

Stefansson noted that in the North, very lean meat sometimes produced \"digestive disturbances\".  Whereas Stefansson's prior experience was that lean meat would lead to illness after the second or third fatless week, Stefansson developed nausea and diarrhea on the third day at Bellevue.  Stefansson attributes the fast onset of illness due to the usually lean meat that he was served versus the fattier caribou meat he consumed previously.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.biblelife.org/stefansson2.htm|title=Adventures in Diet Part 2 (Harper's Monthly Magazine)|last=Stefansson|first=Vilhjalmur|date=December 1935}}</ref>  After eating fatty meat, he fully recovered in two days.

He was born in Manitoba, Canada, and died at the age of 82.\n\n==Early life==\nStefansson, born William Stephenson, was born at [[Rural Municipality of Gimli|Arnes, Manitoba]], Canada, in 1879. His parents had emigrated from [[Iceland]] to Manitoba two years earlier. After losing two children during a period of devastating flooding, the family moved to [[North Dakota]] in 1880.\n\nHe was educated at the universities [[University of North Dakota|of North Dakota]] and [[University of Iowa|of Iowa]] ([[Bachelor of Arts|A.B.]], 1903). During his college years, in 1899, he changed his name to Vilhjalmur Stefansson. He studied [[anthropology]] at the graduate school of [[Harvard University]], where for two years he was an instructor.\n\n==Early explorations==\nIn 1904 and 1905, Stefansson did archaeological research in [[Iceland]]. Recruited by [[Ejnar Mikkelsen]] and [[Ernest de Koven Leffingwell]] for their Anglo-American Polar Expedition, he lived with the [[Inuit]] of the [[Mackenzie River|Mackenzie Delta]] during the winter of 1906\u20131907, returning alone across country via the [[Porcupine River|Porcupine]] and [[Yukon River|Yukon]] Rivers. Under the auspices of the [[American Museum of Natural History]], [[New York City|New York]], he and Dr. [[Rudolph Martin Anderson|R. M. Anderson]] undertook the ethnological survey of the Central Arctic coasts of the shores of [[North America]] from 1908 to 1912.\n\nIn 1908, Stefansson made a decision that would affect the rest of his time in Alaska: he hired the [[Inuk]] guide [[Natkusiak]], who would remain with him as his primary guide for the rest of his Alaska expeditions.<ref>[http://pubs.aina.ucalgary.ca/arctic/Arctic45-1-90.pdf Natkusiak (ca. 1885\u20131947)], ''Arctic'' magazine, Vol. 45, No. 1 (March 1992), pp. 90\u201392.</ref> At the time he met Natkusiak, the Inuk guide was working for Capt.

Newspapers subsequently popularised the term \"Blonde Eskimo\", which caught more readers' attention despite Stefansson's preference for the term Copper Inuit. Stefansson later referenced Greely's work in his writings and the term \"Blonde Eskimo\" became applied to sightings of light haired [[Eskimo]]s from as early as the 17th century.<ref>''My Life with the Eskimo'', 1922, p. 199 (reprinted by Kessinger Publishing, 2004).</ref>\n\n==Loss of the ''Karluk'' and rescue of survivors==\n{{Further|Voyage of the Karluk}}\nStefansson organized and directed the [[Canadian Arctic Expedition 1913\u20131916]] to explore the regions west of [[Queen Elizabeth Islands|Parry Archipelago]] for the [[Government of Canada]]. Three ships, the ''[[HMCS Karluk|Karluk]]'', the ''Mary Sachs'', and the ''Alaska'' were employed.\n\nStefansson left the main ship, the ''Karluk'', when it became stuck in the ice in August/September 1913. Stefansson's explanation was that he and five other expedition members left to go hunting to provide fresh meat for the crew. However, William Laird McKinley and others left on the ship suspected that he left deliberately, anticipating that the ship would be carried off by moving ice, as indeed happened. The ship, with Captain [[Robert Bartlett (explorer)|Robert Bartlett]] of Newfoundland and 24 other expedition members aboard, drifted westward with the ice and was eventually crushed. It sank on January 11, 1914. Four men made their way to [[Herald Island (Arctic)|Herald Island]], but died there, possibly from carbon monoxide poisoning, before they could be rescued. Four other men, including [[Alistair Mackay]] who had been part of the Sir [[Ernest Shackleton]]'s [[British Antarctic Expedition, 1907\u201309|British Antarctic Expedition]], tried reaching [[Wrangel Island]] on their own but perished. The remaining members of the expedition, under command of Captain Bartlett, made their way to Wrangel Island where three died. Bartlett and his Inuk hunter Kataktovik made their way across sea ice to Siberia to get help. Remaining survivors were picked up by the American fishing [[schooner]] [[King & Winge (fishing schooner)|''King & Winge'']] and the [[United States Revenue Cutter Service]] [[Revenue cutter|cutter]] {{USRC|Bear}}.<ref>Newell, Gordon R., ed., ''H.W. McCurdy Maritime History of the Pacific Northwest'', at 242, Superior Publishing, Seattle, Washington, 1966.</ref>\n\nStefansson resumed his explorations by [[sledge]] over the [[Arctic Ocean]], here known as the [[Beaufort Sea]], leaving [[Collinson Point, Alaska|Collinson Point]], [[Alaska]] in April, 1914. A supporting sledge turned back {{convert|75|mi|abbr=on}} offshore, but he and two men continued onward on one sledge, living largely by his rifle on polar game for 96 days until his party reached the ''Mary Sachs'' in the autumn. Stefansson continued exploring until 1918.\n\n==Wrangel Island fiasco==\nIn 1921, he encouraged and planned an expedition for four young men to colonise [[Wrangel Island]] north of [[Siberia]], where the eleven survivors of the 22 men on the ''Karluk'' had lived from March to September 1914. Stefansson had designs for forming an exploration company that would be geared towards individuals interested in touring the Arctic island.\n\nStefansson originally wanted to claim Wrangel Island for the Canadian government. However, due to the dangerous outcome from his initial trip to the island, the government refused to assist with the expedition. He then wanted to claim the land for [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]] but the British government rejected this claim when it was made by the young men. The raising of the British flag on Wrangel Island, an acknowledged [[Russia]]n territory, caused an international incident.\n\nThe four young men, Frederick Maurer, E. Lorne Knight, and Milton Galle from the US, and Allan Crawford of Canada, were inexperienced and ill-equipped for the trip. All perished on the island or in an attempt to get help from Siberia across the frozen [[Chukchi Sea]]. The only survivors were an Inuk woman, [[Ada Blackjack]], whom the men had hired as a seamstress in [[Nome, Alaska]], and taken with them, and the expedition's cat, Vic. Ada Blackjack had taught herself survival skills and cared for the last man on the island, E. Lorne Knight, until he died of [[scurvy]]. Blackjack was rescued in 1923 after two years on Wrangel Island. Stefansson drew the ire of the public and the families for having sent such ill-equipped young men to Wrangel. His reputation was severely tainted by this disaster and that of the ''Karluk''.\n\n==Discoveries==\nStefansson's discoveries included new land (such as [[Brock Island|Brock]], [[Mackenzie King Island|Mackenzie King]], [[Borden Island|Borden]], [[Meighen Island|Meighen]], and [[Lougheed Island]]s)<ref name=Stefansson>{{cite book\n  | last = Stefansson\n  | first = Vilhjalmur\n  | title = The Friendly Arctic: The Story of Five Years in Polar Regions\n  | publisher = Macmillan\n  | year = 1922\n  | location = New York\n| url =https://archive.org/details/friendlyarctics01stefgoog}}</ref> and the edge of the [[continental shelf]]. His journeys and successes are among the marvels of [[Arctic exploration]]. He extended the discoveries of [[Francis Leopold McClintock]]. From April 1914 to June 1915 he lived on the [[Drift ice|ice pack]]. Stefansson continued his explorations leaving from [[Herschel Island]] on August 23, 1915.\n\nOn January 30, 1920, ''The Pioche Record'' reported that Icelandic explorer Vilhjalmur Stefansson discovered a lost cache from the [[McClintock Arctic expedition|1853 McClintock expedition]] on [[Melville Island (Northwest Territories and Nunavut)|Melville Island]]. Clothing and food from the cache was in excellent condition despite the harsh arctic conditions.{{sfn|''The Pioche Record'', January 30,|1920|p=3}}\n\nIn 1921, he was awarded the [[Gold Medal (RGS)|Founder's Gold Medal]] of the [[Royal Geographical Society]] for his explorations of the Arctic.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rgs.org/NR/rdonlyres/C5962519-882A-4C67-803D-0037308C756D/0/GoldMedallists18322011.pdf| title=List of Past Gold Medal Winners|publisher= Royal Geographical Society|accessdate = 24 August 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Later career==\nStefansson remained a well-known explorer for the rest of his life. Late in life, through his affiliation with [[Dartmouth College]] (he was Director of Polar Studies), he became a major figure in the establishment of the [[United States Army|US Army]]'s [[Cold Regions Research and Engineering Laboratory]] (CRREL) in [[Hanover, New Hampshire|Hanover]], [[New Hampshire]]. CRREL-supported research, often conducted in winter on the forbidding summit of [[Mount Washington (New Hampshire)|Mount Washington]], has been key to developing mat\u00e9riel and doctrine to support alpine conflict.\n\nStefansson joined [[the Explorers Club]] in 1908, four years after its founding. He later served as Club President twice: 1919\u20131922 and 1937\u20131939. In the all-male Club, the Board drew attention under Stefansson's reign when it put forth an amendment to its bylaws that read in 1938, \"A Woman's Roll of Honor shall be instituted to which the Board of Directors may name women of the United States and Canada in recognition of the noteworthy achievements and writings in the field of the Club's interests, primarily exploration.\"<ref name=\"Minutes 1938\">Minutes, Explorer's Club, 4 January 1938.</ref> Perhaps to comfort fellow members, the article added, \"This Woman's Roll of Honor shall be quite outside the Club's organisation but shall correspond in dignity to the Honorary Class of (male) members within it.\"<ref name=\"Minutes 1938\" /> His continued support of women in anthropology is demonstrated in his 1939\u20131941 mentorship of [[Gitel Steed]] as she undertook research on diet and subsistence for his two-volume ''Lives of the Hunters'', from which she began a dissertation on hunter-gatherer.\n\nWhile living in New York City, Stefansson was one of the regulars at [[Romany Marie]]'s [[Greenwich Village]] [[caf\u00e9]]s.<ref name=\"Biography\">Robert Shulman.

One of the organisations prominent in this campaign was the [[Organization for Jewish Colonization in Russia|American Committee for the Settlement of Jews in Birobidjan]], or Ambijan, formed in 1934. A tireless proponent of settlement in Birobidzhan, Stefansson appeared at countless Ambijan meetings, dinners, and rallies, and proved an invaluable resource. Ambijan produced a 50-page Year Book at the end of 1936, full of testimonials and letters of support. Among these was one from Stefansson, who was now also listed as a member of Ambijan's Board of Directors and Governors: \"The Birobidjan project seems to me to offer a most statesmanlike contribution to the problem of the rehabilitation of eastern and central European Jewry,\" he wrote.\n\nAmbijan's national conference in New York, November 25\u201326, 1944, pledged to raise $1 million to support refugees in [[Volgograd|Stalingrad]] and Birobidzhan. Prominent guests and speakers included New York Congressman [[Emanuel Celler]], Senator [[Elbert D. Thomas]] of [[Utah]], and Soviet ambassador [[Andrei Gromyko]]. A public dinner, attended by the delegates and their guests, was hosted by Vilhjalmur and spouse Evelyn Stefansson. Vilhjalmur was selected as one of two vice-presidents of the organisation.\n\nBut with the growing anti-Russian feeling in the country after [[World War II]], \"expos\u00e9s\" of Stefansson began to appear in the press. In August 1951, he was denounced as a [[Communism|Communist]] before a [[United States Senate Subcommittee on Internal Security|Senate Internal Security subcommittee]] by [[Louis F. Budenz]], a Communist-turned-Catholic. Perhaps Stefansson himself had by then some second thoughts about Ambijan, for his posthumously published autobiography made no mention of his work on its behalf. Nor, for that matter, did his otherwise very complete obituary in ''[[The New York Times]]'' of August 27, 1962.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Srebrnik | first1 = Henry | year = 1998 | title = The Radical 'Second Life' of Vilhjalmur Stefansson | url = | journal = Arctic | volume = 51 | issue = 1| pages = 58\u201360 | doi=10.14430/arctic1046}}</ref>\n\n==Advocacy of an exclusively meat diet==\nStefansson is also a figure of considerable interest in [[diet (nutrition)|diet]]ary circles, especially those with an interest in very [[low-carbohydrate diet]]s. Stefansson documented the fact that the [[Inuit diet]] consisted of about 90% meat and fish; Inuit would often go 6 to 9 months a year eating nothing but meat and fish\u2014what might nowadays be perceived to be a 'zerocarb' / [[no-carbohydrate diet]]. (The diet technically contains a very low amount of carbohydates as the fresh fish that the Inuit ate would have contained a small amount of glycogen.) He found that he and his fellow explorers of European, Negro, and South Sea Islands descent were also perfectly healthy on such a diet. \n\nSome years after his first experience with the Inuit (known as Eskimos in Stefansson's time), Dr. Stefansson returned to the Arctic with a colleague, Dr. Karsten Anderson, to carry out research for the American Museum of Natural History. They were supplied with every necessity including a year's supply of 'civilised' food. This they declined, electing instead to live off the land. In the end, the one-year project stretched to four years, during which time the two men ate only the meat they could kill and the fish they could catch in the Canadian Arctic. Neither of the two men suffered any adverse after-effects from their four-year experiment. It was evident to Stefansson, as it had been to [[William Banting]], that the body could function perfectly well, remain healthy, vigorous and slender if it used a diet in which as much food was eaten as the body required, only carbohydrate was restricted and the total number of calories was ignored.<ref name=\"Groves\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.second-opinions.co.uk/banting.html|title=WILLIAM BANTING: The Father of the Low-Carbohydrate Diet|last=Groves, PhD|first=Barry|year=2002|publisher=Second Opinions|accessdate=26 December 2007}}</ref>\n\nWhile there was considerable skepticism when Stefansson reported his findings about the viability of an exclusively meat diet, his claims have been borne out in later studies and analyses.<ref>Fediuk, Karen. 2000 [http://members.shaw.ca/karen.fediuk/VitaminCintheInuitdiet.pdf Vitamin C in the Inuit diet: past and present].

The book ''The Unseen Power: Public Relations'' states that [[Pendleton Dudley|Pendelton Dudley]], once considered the \"dean of public relations\", convinced the [[American Meat Institute]] to fund this study.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Unseen Power: Public Relations|last=Cutlip|first=Scott|publisher=Routledge|year=1994|isbn=0805814655|location=London|pages=101|accessdate=}}</ref>\n\nThe results were published, and Anderson had developed [[glycosuria]] during this time, which is normally associated with untreated diabetes.  But unlike the pathology of diabetes, in this particular study, glucosuria was present in Anderson for 4 days and coincided only with the giving of a 100 gm of glucose for a tolerance test and with the first 3 days of his pneumonia, where he received fluids and a diet rich in carbohydrate.

Stefansson noted that in the North, very lean meat sometimes produced \"digestive disturbances\".  Whereas Stefansson's prior experience was that lean meat would lead to illness after the second or third fatless week, Stefansson developed nausea and diarrhea on the third day at Bellevue.  Stefansson attributes the fast onset of illness due to the usually lean meat that he was served versus the fattier caribou meat he consumed previously.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.biblelife.org/stefansson2.htm|title=Adventures in Diet Part 2 (Harper's Monthly Magazine)|last=Stefansson|first=Vilhjalmur|date=December 1935}}</ref>  After eating fatty meat, he fully recovered in two days.

Carmen released his first solo album ''[[Eric Carmen (1975 album)|Eric Carmen]]'', which contained the worldwide hit with \"[[All By Myself]]\".\n\n\"Hungry Eyes\" was his biggest hit and was written in 1984 by John DeNicola and Franke Previte. It was originally recorded by Previte's band, Frankie and The Knockouts for their album ''Makin' the Point''. [[Jimmy Ienner]], the producer of Carmen's band from his early career, The Raspberries, asked him to sing this song for the ''Dirty Dancing'' album because he was familiar with Carmen's musical style. Carmen was hesitant to produce a song for another film sound track because he believed that soundtrack music had \"horrible deaths\", but Carmen recorded a very popular song that can still be heard on radio stations and TV commercials.<ref name=\"auto\">\"Welcome to EricCarmen.com.\" Welcome to EricCarmen.com.

Carmen released his first solo album ''[[Eric Carmen (1975 album)|Eric Carmen]]'', which contained the worldwide hit with \"[[All By Myself]]\".\n\n\"Hungry Eyes\" was his biggest hit and was written in 1984 by John DeNicola and Franke Previte. It was originally recorded by Previte's band, Frankie and The Knockouts for their album ''Makin' the Point''. [[Jimmy Ienner]], the producer of Carmen's band from his early career, The Raspberries, asked him to sing this song for the ''Dirty Dancing'' album because he was familiar with Carmen's musical style. Carmen was hesitant to produce a song for another film sound track because he believed that soundtrack music had \"horrible deaths\", but Carmen recorded a very popular song that can still be heard on radio stations and TV commercials.<ref name=\"auto\">\"Welcome to EricCarmen.com.\" Welcome to EricCarmen.com.

They were built under the Tai Tam Valley Scheme and Tai Tam Tuk Scheme serving an aggregate capacity of 9 million cubic metre<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.afcd.gov.hk/english/country/cou_vis/cou_vis_cou/cou_vis_cou_tt/cou_vis_cou_tt.html |title=AFCD Tai Tam |publisher=Afcd.gov.hk |date= |accessdate=2015-03-08}}</ref> to meet the ever-increasing demands of water. Upon completion, pressure of water demands from urbanisation spread, from central and western districts to the eastern side of Hong Kong Island, was gradually released.\n\nThe Tai Tam Reservoir is the second oldest and largest reservoir built on Hong Kong Island in the [[Tai Tam Country Park]] in Hong Kong East by the [[British Empire|British colonial]] government. The project lasted from 1883 till 1888, costing $1,250,000. Its capacity was {{convert|250|e6impgal|m3}} originally and was expanded several times afterwards to {{convert|388|e6impgal|m3}} of water.\n\nThe Tai Tam Reservoir was important to the early development of Hong Kong. Its water catered for the needs of water, even present day Central, Wanchai, [[Causeway Bay]], [[North Point]] and [[Shau Kei Wan]]. Easing the water demands of central, the reservoir moved the city further to the east. Urban area consequently expanded and spread to the eastern side of the island.\n\n[[Water resources]] was still tight in Hong Kong in the early 1900s. Thus, the colonial government conducted The Extension of the Tai Tam Water Supply System. The project was divided into two phases. In Phase I, in 1904 \u2013 1908, the Tai Tam Byewash Reservoir and the Tai Tam Intermediate Reservoir were built with capacity of {{convert|22.4|e6impgal|m3}} and {{convert|196|e6impgal|m3}} respectively. Phase II started in 1913. The Tai Tam Tuk Reservoir was built from 1914 to 1918 with a capacity of {{convert|1.42|e9impgal|m3}}. The Tai Tam Water Supply System could basically meet the needs of the [[Hong Kong Island]] at that time. The Tai Tam Group of Reservoirs is a reminiscence of the water supply history of early Hong Kong.\n\n==Characteristics==\nThe reservoir structures are regarded as a kind of [[Utilitarian]] engineering structures influenced by Italianate Renaissance of [[Victorian Architecture|Victorian]] civil engineering. Therefore, they are considered having heritage value and are kept intact.\n\nWith regard to the engineering techniques used, the system used in Tai Tam Reservoir relied much less on gravity flow, which only accounted for about 20% of the total capacity of the ultimate [[fresh water]] supply. It was built using a more advanced engineering techniques than those used in building the Pokfulam one, as the system of [[Pokfulam Reservoir]] relied completely on a simple principle based on [[gravity]] \u2013 water running down from a higher place to a lower one.<ref name=\"brief\">{{cite web|url=http://www.lcsd.gov.hk/CE/Museum/Monument/form/Brief_Information_on_proposed_Grade_II_Items.pdf |accessdate=3 December 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130223210048/http://www.lcsd.gov.hk/CE/Museum/Monument/form/Brief_Information_on_proposed_Grade_II_Items.pdf |archivedate=23 February 2013 }}</ref>\n\n==Historical structures of the trail==\nThe trail is an example of conservation and revitalisation of Hong Kong heritage.

Years of Construction\n! Description/History\n! Picture\n|-\n| 1. Tai Tam Upper Reservoir Dam\n| 1883\u20131888\n| This reservoir dam was the largest dam structure built in Hong Kong in 1888. It was originally {{convert|30.5|m|ft|abbr=off}} high, {{convert|121.9|m|ft|abbr=off}} long and {{convert|18.3|m|ft|abbr=off}} wide at its base, then was raised a further 3.84 metres in 1897. The towering walls of this masonry faced concrete gravity dam contain the reservoir waters to Central. The masonry is roughly dressed with ashlar copings. Waters gravitated through a 2.2 kilometres long tunnel and a 5 kilometres aqueduct to the destination. Along the dam, walkways or berms, which were presumably for regular inspection, are supported by inverted T-shaped stanchions.<ref name=\"brief\" />\n|[[File:Tai Tam Upper Reservoir Dam 01.JPG|200px]]\n|-\n| 2. Tai Tam Upper Reservoir Valve House\n| 1883\u20131888\n| Along the top of the reservoir dam, the valve house built of rock-faced rusticated granite blocks is situated at one third of the way. The valve house has been built in a square structure with one door opening and two back window openings, but blocked now. A flat roof with the projecting cornice, supported by carved ornamental corbels with small in-between gaps for ventilation, has replaced the hipped roof.<ref name=\"brief\" />\n|[[File:Tai Tam Upper Reservoir Valve House.JPG|200px]]\n|-\n| 3. Tai Tam Upper Reservoir Masonry Aqueduct\n| 1883\u20131888\n| It has 21 arches and is situated behind a small hill to the southwest of the dam. The aqueduct and the masonry bridge were built very much alike. In other words, the aqueduct is also made of thick concrete slabs supported on strengthened and moulded masonry piers and columns, across what presumably was once a stream bed and diverts rainwater from an indirect drainage catchment to the upper reservoir. It was regarded as a piece of Victorian civil engineering heritage.<ref name=\"brief\" />\n|[[File:Tai Tam Reservoir 3.jpg|200px]]\n|-\n| 4. Tai Tam Upper Reservoir Masonry Bridge\n| 1883\u20131888\n| The masonry bridges are constructed with thick concrete slabs supported on piers or columns built of reinforced concrete. Both piers and columns capped with moulded capitals or corbels are used to give extra support for the bridges. The two bridges are built at a right angle to the aqueduct behind a small hill to the southwest of the dam. The masonry bridges span across where was once the byewash of the Tai Tam Upper Reservoir. They are the oldest structures on the Trail with Masonry Aqueduct, Dam, Valve House, and Tunnel Inlet.<ref name=\"Hong Kong Extras\">{{cite web|url=http://www.hongkongextras.com/whatsnew.html|title=Tai Tam Waterworks Heritage Trail, Hong Kong Extras|publisher=Hongkongextras.com|accessdate=10 October 2014}}</ref>\n|[[File:Tai tam reservoir road bridge.JPG|200px]]\n|-\n| 5.

The tunnel inlet marked by a commemorative stone with the dates 1883-8 is located at the south of the dam. It brings water stored in the Tai Tam Reservoir through the culvert with an iron grating and serves the needs of water supply of residents and businesses in the Central and Western districts of Hong Kong Island through the Bowen Aqueduct pass through Wan Chai. Access catwalks with tubular steel guardrails have been constructed above it. About thirty years later, a recorder house with a flat roof with a plain coping to the parapet, surmounting the tunnel inlet, was built to monitor water flows. Unlike the plain design of its entrance door and window, this recorder house was built with coursed granite walls.<ref name=\"brief\" />\n|\n|-\n| 6. Tai Tam Byewash Reservoir Dam\n| 1904\n| Built in a concrete gravity construction faced with masonry, the reservoir dam is supported and strengthened at either end using wing walls of coursed rubble.

They were built under the Tai Tam Valley Scheme and Tai Tam Tuk Scheme serving an aggregate capacity of 9 million cubic metre<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.afcd.gov.hk/english/country/cou_vis/cou_vis_cou/cou_vis_cou_tt/cou_vis_cou_tt.html |title=AFCD Tai Tam |publisher=Afcd.gov.hk |date= |accessdate=2015-03-08}}</ref> to meet the ever-increasing demands of water. Upon completion, pressure of water demands from urbanisation spread, from central and western districts to the eastern side of Hong Kong Island, was gradually released.\n\nThe Tai Tam Reservoir is the second oldest and largest reservoir built on Hong Kong Island in the [[Tai Tam Country Park]] in Hong Kong East by the [[British Empire|British colonial]] government. The project lasted from 1883 till 1888, costing $1,250,000. Its capacity was {{convert|250|e6impgal|m3}} originally and was expanded several times afterwards to {{convert|388|e6impgal|m3}} of water.\n\nThe Tai Tam Reservoir was important to the early development of Hong Kong. Its water catered for the needs of water, even present day Central, Wanchai, [[Causeway Bay]], [[North Point]] and [[Shau Kei Wan]]. Easing the water demands of central, the reservoir moved the city further to the east. Urban area consequently expanded and spread to the eastern side of the island.\n\n[[Water resources]] was still tight in Hong Kong in the early 1900s. Thus, the colonial government conducted The Extension of the Tai Tam Water Supply System. The project was divided into two phases. In Phase I, in 1904 \u2013 1908, the Tai Tam Byewash Reservoir and the Tai Tam Intermediate Reservoir were built with capacity of {{convert|22.4|e6impgal|m3}} and {{convert|196|e6impgal|m3}} respectively. Phase II started in 1913. The Tai Tam Tuk Reservoir was built from 1914 to 1918 with a capacity of {{convert|1.42|e9impgal|m3}}. The Tai Tam Water Supply System could basically meet the needs of the [[Hong Kong Island]] at that time. The Tai Tam Group of Reservoirs is a reminiscence of the water supply history of early Hong Kong.\n\n==Characteristics==\nThe reservoir structures are regarded as a kind of [[Utilitarian]] engineering structures influenced by Italianate Renaissance of [[Victorian Architecture|Victorian]] civil engineering. Therefore, they are considered having heritage value and are kept intact.\n\nWith regard to the engineering techniques used, the system used in Tai Tam Reservoir relied much less on gravity flow, which only accounted for about 20% of the total capacity of the ultimate [[fresh water]] supply. It was built using a more advanced engineering techniques than those used in building the Pokfulam one, as the system of [[Pokfulam Reservoir]] relied completely on a simple principle based on [[gravity]] \u2013 water running down from a higher place to a lower one.<ref name=\"brief\">{{cite web|url=http://www.lcsd.gov.hk/CE/Museum/Monument/form/Brief_Information_on_proposed_Grade_II_Items.pdf |accessdate=3 December 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130223210048/http://www.lcsd.gov.hk/CE/Museum/Monument/form/Brief_Information_on_proposed_Grade_II_Items.pdf |archivedate=23 February 2013 }}</ref>\n\n==Historical structures of the trail==\nThe trail is an example of conservation and revitalisation of Hong Kong heritage.

It was originally {{convert|30.5|m|ft|abbr=off}} high, {{convert|121.9|m|ft|abbr=off}} long and {{convert|18.3|m|ft|abbr=off}} wide at its base, then was raised a further 3.84 metres in 1897. The towering walls of this masonry faced concrete gravity dam contain the reservoir waters to Central. The masonry is roughly dressed with ashlar copings. Waters gravitated through a 2.2 kilometres long tunnel and a 5 kilometres aqueduct to the destination. Along the dam, walkways or berms, which were presumably for regular inspection, are supported by inverted T-shaped stanchions.<ref name=\"brief\" />\n|[[File:Tai Tam Upper Reservoir Dam 01.JPG|200px]]\n|-\n| 2. Tai Tam Upper Reservoir Valve House\n| 1883\u20131888\n| Along the top of the reservoir dam, the valve house built of rock-faced rusticated granite blocks is situated at one third of the way. The valve house has been built in a square structure with one door opening and two back window openings, but blocked now. A flat roof with the projecting cornice, supported by carved ornamental corbels with small in-between gaps for ventilation, has replaced the hipped roof.<ref name=\"brief\" />\n|[[File:Tai Tam Upper Reservoir Valve House.JPG|200px]]\n|-\n| 3. Tai Tam Upper Reservoir Masonry Aqueduct\n| 1883\u20131888\n| It has 21 arches and is situated behind a small hill to the southwest of the dam. The aqueduct and the masonry bridge were built very much alike. In other words, the aqueduct is also made of thick concrete slabs supported on strengthened and moulded masonry piers and columns, across what presumably was once a stream bed and diverts rainwater from an indirect drainage catchment to the upper reservoir. It was regarded as a piece of Victorian civil engineering heritage.<ref name=\"brief\" />\n|[[File:Tai Tam Reservoir 3.jpg|200px]]\n|-\n| 4. Tai Tam Upper Reservoir Masonry Bridge\n| 1883\u20131888\n| The masonry bridges are constructed with thick concrete slabs supported on piers or columns built of reinforced concrete. Both piers and columns capped with moulded capitals or corbels are used to give extra support for the bridges. The two bridges are built at a right angle to the aqueduct behind a small hill to the southwest of the dam. The masonry bridges span across where was once the byewash of the Tai Tam Upper Reservoir.

However, participants of guided tour are allowed to visit them.\n\nBetween 10 October 2009 and 19 December 2009, there will be guided tours at Tai Tam Waterworks Heritage Trail every Saturday morning, starting at 10.30am and 11.30am respectively. The tour is about 5&nbsp;km long and lasts for about two hours. It will start at Tai Tam Reservoir Road (near Parkview) and end at Tai Tam Tuk Raw Water Pumping Station.<ref name=\"guided tour\" />\n\n==See also==\n* [[Heritage conservation in Hong Kong]]\n**[[Heritage Trails in Hong Kong]]\n**[[List of Grade I historic buildings in Hong Kong]]\n**[[List of Grade II historic buildings in Hong Kong]]\n**[[List of Grade III historic buildings in Hong Kong]]\n* [[Tai Tam Country Park]]\n* [[History of Hong Kong]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|22 Historic Structures of Tai Tam Group of Reservoirs}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20090613080022/http://www.info.gov.hk/water150/mbook/TEXT/TEXT_ENG/index.html Water for a Barren Rock, Water Supplies Department]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20140809040706/http://www.wsd.gov.hk/filemanager/en/share/monuments/tai_tam.pdf Wsd.gov.hk]\n* [http://the-sun.on.cc/cnt/news/20090919/00407_013.html The-sun.on.cc]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20111006135018/http://www.hkdailynews.com.hk/news.php?id=61680 Hkdailynews.com.hk]\n\n{{Reservoirs of Hong Kong}}\n{{Heritage conservation in Hong Kong |state=autocollapse}}\n\n[[Category:Buildings and structures in Hong Kong]]\n[[Category:Declared monuments of Hong Kong]]\n", "name_user": "MowerBreeze", "label": "safe", "comment": "Correct number of monuments", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tai_Tam_Waterworks_Heritage_Trail"}

While the police fauna squad and park rangers fought the practice, government agencies such as [[South Bank Parklands|Southbank Corporation]], [[Ports North|Cairns Port Authority]] and [[TAFE Queensland]] were among the buyers of the illegally-obtained plants.

The following day they drove Barbagallo's [[Toyota Land Cruiser]], laden with [[automatic rifle]]s and a [[chainsaw]], into the national park. Breaking or circumventing barricades meant to keep vehicles out, they parked near a stand of foxtail palms and set off on foot.

A group of DEH rangers discovered the Land Cruiser's tyre tracks and, knowing smugglers were active in the area, decided to investigate. One of their number, a [[Vietnam War]] veteran named Pat Shears, set off on foot while his colleagues remained with their vehicle at the park boundary. Shears discovered the vehicle and determined, based on the location, the rifles and the chainsaw, that it belonged to smugglers. Hearing Barbagallo's party in the distance and fearing they were armed, he drove the Land Cruiser out of the park, secured it at the [[Lakefield National Park]] ranger station, and informed his superior and Cooktown police of the incident. Shears's superior, Peter Stanton, advised Shears to leave the matter in the hands of the [[Queensland Police Service|police]] rather than reporting it immediately to the DEH regional office in [[Cairns]].
