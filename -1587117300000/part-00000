Since the [[Siege of Jerusalem (70)|destruction of the Second Temple]] in [[Jerusalem]] in 70 CE, there has been no single body that has a leadership position over the entire [[Jewish diaspora]]. Various branches of [[Judaism]], as well as Jewish religious or secular unities and political movements around the world elect or appoint their governing bodies, often subdivided by country or region.\n\n== Historic leadership ==\n===Biblical leadership (before 70 CE)===\n{{See also|List of Jewish Biblical figures}}\nDuring the era of the [[Tanakh]], various forms of leadership developed. There were the heads of the original [[Hebrew tribe]]s, and then also [[Nevi'im|prophets]] such as [[Moses]], [[Jeremiah (prophet)|Jeremiah]] and [[Samuel (Bible)|Samuel]] and whose words inspire people to this day, [[Biblical judges|judges]] such as [[Samson]], [[Books of Kings|kings]] such as [[David]] and [[Solomon]], [[Kohen|priests]] of the [[Temple in Jerusalem]], and the [[Sanhedrin]] which was the [[judiciary]].\n\n===Mishnaic, Talmudic, Middle Ages leadership (70 to 17th century)===\n{{See also2|[[List of rabbis#Rabbits: Mishnaic (Tannaim)|Mishnaic rabbis]]; [[List of rabbis#Rabbis: Talmudic (Amoraim)|Talmudic rabbis]], [[List of rabbis#Rabbis: Middle Ages|Middle Ages rabbis]]}}\nWith the demise of [[History of ancient Israel and Judah|ancient kingdoms of Israel and Judah]] and coinciding with the revolt of the [[Maccabees]] against [[ancient Greece]] and later [[Jewish-Roman wars]], the sages of the [[Mishnah]] and subsequently the [[Talmud]], referred to as the [[Oral Law]] in Judaism, took on a growing and central leadership role. After the destruction of the [[Second Temple]] and the subsequent exile for almost two thousand years, the Jews scattered throughout the world turned to their most learned [[rabbi]]s for local leadership and council.\n\nDuring [[Bar Kokhba's revolt]] against [[Roman Empire]] (132-135), the supreme religious authority [[Rabbi Akiva]] sanctioned [[Simon bar Kokhba]] to be a war leader, whereas during the 2nd century [[Judah haNasi]] was not only the supreme temporal leader sanctioned by Rome, but also edited the original work of the [[Mishnah]] which became the \"de facto [[constitution]]\" of the world's Jewry. The final editions of the [[Talmud]] became the core [[curriculum]] of the majority of Jews.\n\nIn [[Babylonia]] the [[Exilarch]] was almost always a rabbinical personality. The [[Geonim]] such as [[Saadia Gaon]] (892-942) were not only great sages but also political guides. The writings and rulings of those such as [[Rashi]] (1040\u20131105), [[Maimonides]] (1135\u20131204), [[Yosef Karo]] (1488\u20131575) who published the most widely accepted code of Jewish law the [[Shulkhan Arukh]], [[Isaac Luria]] (1534\u20131572), the [[Vilna Gaon]] (1720\u20131797), the [[Yisrael Meir Kagan|Chafetz Chaim]] (1838\u20131933) and many others have shaped [[Halakha|Jewish law]] for almost two thousand years, as their religious rulings were published, distributed, studied, and observed until the present time.\n\n===Early modern leadership (18th and 19th centuries)===\n{{See also2|[[List of rabbis#Rabbis: Later Middle Ages (Acharonim)|Rabbis of the Early Modern period]]}}\nThe loose collection of learned rabbis that governed the dispersed Jewish community held sway for a long time. Great parts of [[Central Europe]] accepted the leadership of the rabbinical [[Council of Four Lands]] from the 16th to the late 18th centuries. In the [[Eastern Europe]], in spite of the rivalry between the schools of thought of the Vilna Gaon (or the GRA, Rabbi [[Elijah ben Solomon]], 1720\u20131797) of the [[Mitnagdim]], who spoke against Hasidic Judaism and [[Baal Shem Tov]] (Rabbi [[Israel ben Eliezer]], 1700\u20131760), the founder of [[Hasidic Judaism]], rabbis were regarded as the final arbiters of community decisions. Tens of thousands of [[Responsa]] and many works were published and studied wherever Jews lived in organized communities. In [[Western Europe]], especially in monarchies, where no equal rights were granted for the Jewish population, radical [[Haskalah|Maskilim]] defined the new role of religion as an education of just citizens \u2014 like [[Moses Mendelssohn]] in his book ''[[Jerusalem (Mendelssohn)|Jerusalem or On Religious Power and Judaism]]'' which was a response to the Prussian reformer [[Christian Wilhelm von Dohm]]. The radical tendency of the pedagogic movement went so far, that Mendelssohn's student [[David Friedl\u00e4nder]] identified Judaism with the seclusion of modern European culture and secular Judaism could end up in conversion to the religion of the unsecularized state. In contradiction to his teacher early modern leadership turned out to be misled leadership, whose followers ended up as \"Jewish citizens without any conscience\".\n\n==Modern religious leadership (after 19th century)==\n\n===Decline of rabbinical influence===\nWith the growth of the [[Renaissance]] and the development of the [[secular]] [[modern world]], and as Jews were welcomed into non-Jewish society particularly during the times of [[Napoleon]] in the 18th and 19th centuries, Jews began to leave the [[Ghetto#Jewish ghettos in Europe|Jewish ghettos in Europe]], and simultaneously rejected the traditional roles of the rabbis as communal and religious leaders. New leaders such as [[Israel Jacobson]], father of the German [[Reform Judaism]] movement, launched an egalitarian, modernist stance that challenged the Orthodoxy. The resulting fractures in Jewish society has translated into a situation whereby there is no single religious governing body for the entire Jewish community at the present time.\n\n===Modern Synagogue leadership===\nIn individual religious congregations or [[synagogues]], the spiritual leader is generally the [[rabbi]]. Rabbis are expected to be taught in both the [[Talmud]] and the ''[[Shulkhan Arukh]]'' (Code of Jewish Law) as well as many other classical texts of Jewish scholarship. Rabbis go through formal training in Rabbinical texts and [[responsa]], either at a [[yeshiva]] or similar institution. \"Rabbi\" is not a universal term however, as many Sephardic rabbinic Jewish communities refer to their leaders as ''hakham'' (\"wise man\"). Among Yemenite Jews, known as ''Teimanim'', the term ''mori'' (\"my teacher\") is used. Each religious tradition has its own qualifications for rabbis; for more information, see [[Semicha]] (\"ordination\"). In addition to the rabbi, most synagogues have a ''[[hazzan]]'' (cantor) who leads many parts of the [[Jewish services|prayer service]].\n\n===Orthodox and Haredi rabbinic leadership===\n{{See also2|[[List of rabbis#Orthodox rabbis|Orthodox rabbis]]}}\nIn Israel the office of [[Chief Rabbi]] </s></s>has always been very influential. Various Orthodox movements, such as [[Agudath Israel of America]] and the [[Shas]] party in Israel strictly follow the rulings of their [[Rosh yeshiva]]s who are often famous Talmud scholars. The last [[Rebbe]] of [[Lubavitch]], Rabbi [[Menachem Mendel Schneerson]], the late Rabbi [[Elazar Menachem Shach]], and Rabbi [[Ovadia Yosef]] in Israel are examples of powerful contemporary Haredi rabbis. The [[Haredi Agudah]] movements receive and follow the policy guidelines of their own ''[[Moetzes Gedolei HaTorah|Council of Torah Sages]]''. In the [[Hassidic]] movements, leadership is usually hereditary.\n\n===Reform, Progressive, Liberal, Conservative, and Reconstructionist leadership===\n:''Main articles: [[List of rabbis#Conservative rabbis|Conservative rabbis]], [[List of rabbis#Reform rabbis|Reform rabbis]], [[List of rabbis#Reconstructionist rabbis|Reconstructionist rabbis]]''\nIn both the Reform and Conservative of Judaism, rabbis are often trained at religious universities, such as the [[Jewish Theological Seminary of America|Jewish Theological Seminary]] in New York City for the Conservative movement, [[Hebrew Union College]] for the American Reform movement, and [[Leo Baeck College]] for the UK Liberal and Reform Movements. The Reform, Conservative, and Reconstructionist traditions each have their own governing group or individual leaders. Membership in these governing groups are selected by representatives of the Jewish community they serve, with Jewish scholarship considered to be the key factors for determining leaders. These governing bodies make decisions on the nature of religious practice within their tradition, as well as ordaining and assigning [[rabbis]] and other religious leaders.\n\nThe Union of Reform Judaism (URJ), the synagogue arm of the Reform Movement in North America, is governed by a 253-member Board of Trustees in close partnership with URJ Chair Daryl Messinger, URJ President Rabbi Rick Jacobs, and the senior leadership team.

The body of Reform rabbis is the [[Central Conference of American Rabbis]].\n\n==Secular leadership==\nFollowing the [[Renaissance]] and the [[The Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] in [[Europe]] (with its Jewish \"extension\" the [[Haskalah]] movement, which led to much modern-day assimilation into the cultures of their native countries), the variety of Jewish practice grew, with a widespread adoption of [[secular]] [[values]] and life-styles. Many modern Jewish communities are served by a variety of secular organizations at the local, national, and international levels. These organizations have no official role in religious life, but often play an important part in the Jewish community. Most of the largest groups, such as [[Hadassah]] and the [http://www.ujc.org/ United Jewish Communities], have an elected leadership. No one secular group represents the entire Jewish community, and there is often significant internal debate among Jews about the stances these organizations take on affairs dealing with the Jewish community as a whole, such as antisemitism and Israeli policies.\n\nIn the United States and Canada today, the mainly secular [[United Jewish Communities]] (UJC), formerly known as the [[United Jewish Appeal]] (UJA), represents over 150 [[Jewish Federations]] and 400 independent communities across [[North America]]. Every major American city has its local \"Jewish Federation\", and many have sophisticated community centers and provide services, mainly health care-related. They raise record sums of money for [[philanthropy|philanthropic]] and [[humanitarian]] causes in North America and Israel. Additional local organizations include Jewish Family Services, Jewish nursing homes and Jewish community foundations. Other organizations such as the [[Anti-Defamation League]], [[American Jewish Congress]], [[American Jewish Committee]], and the [[B'nai B'rith]] represent different segments of the American Jewish community on a variety of issues.\n\n==Karaite leadership==\nA [[Karaite Judaism|Karaite]] synagogue is run by a board of directors, and its spiritual leader is often called a ''Hakham'', the equivalent of a \"rabbi\", and matches one in function. The ''Gabbai'' is the treasurer, the ''Shammash'' is the custodian, the ''Hazzan'' leads prayers, and in some the ''Ba'al Qeri'ah'' leads in the reading of the Torah. In America, Karaites are represented by ''the Karaite Jews of America'', and in Israel they are represented.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Rabbi]]\n** [[Chief Rabbi]]\n* [[Sanhedrin]]\n* [[Biblical judges]]\n* [[United Monarchy]]\n** [[Kingdom of Judah]]\n** [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)]]\n* [[Exilarch]]\n* [[Kohen]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Jews and Judaism}}\n\n[[Category:Leadership]]\n[[Category:Jewish society]]\n", "text_old": "{{More citations needed|date=July 2007}}\n{{Judaism}}\n{{Jews and Judaism sidebar |History}}\n'''Jewish leadership''' ({{Lang-he|\u05de\u05e0\u05d4\u05d9\u05d2\u05d5\u05ea \u05d9\u05d4\u05d5\u05d3\u05d9\u05ea}}) has evolved over time.

However, within the illustrations themselves no text is used: no [[speech balloon]]s, no [[onomatopoeia]]s, no written indications to explain where the action takes place or how much time has passed. In order to understand what is happening in the drawings the reader has to read the captions below each image, where the story is written out in the same style as a novel.\n\nMuch like other comics text comics were pre-published in newspapers and weekly comics magazines as a continuous story, told in daily or weekly episodes. When published in book format the comics were sometimes published as actual illustrated novels. In some cases the original text was kept, but only a few drawings were used as illustrations, rather than the entire comic. In the Netherlands text comics were published in small rectangular books, called [[Rectangle|oblong]] books, due to the shape of the books.\n\n==History==\n<!-- [[WP:NFCC]] violation: [[Image:Quadratino.jpg|thumb| ''[[Quadratino]]'' (1910) by Italian artist [[Antonio Rubino]] is an example of a text comic.]] -->\n\nText comics are older than balloon comics. Ancient Egyptian wall paintings with [[hieroglyphs]] explaining the images are the oldest predecessors. In the late 17th century and early 19th century picture narratives were popular in Western Europe, such as ''[[Les Grandes Mis\u00e8res de la guerre]] (1633)'' by [[Jacques Callot]], ''History of the Hellish Popish Plot (1682)'' by [[Francis Barlow (artist)|Francis Barlow]], the cartoons of [[William Hogarth]], [[Thomas Rowlandson]] and [[George Cruikshank]].<ref name=\"google1\">{{cite web|url=https://books.google.be/books?id=2RFaCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA132&lpg=PA132&dq=comic+captions+told+below+the+illustrations&source=bl&ots=IOHB7qU7X6&sig=1NRGddqq0cKKkUvcYPx93EyU0Zc&hl=nl&sa=X&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=comic%20captions%20told%20below%20the%20illustrations&f=false |title=Transforming Anthony Trollope: Dispossession, Victorianism and Nineteenth ... |author=Laurence Grove |page=132 |publisher=Books.google.be |date=13 August 2015 |accessdate=2015-11-18}}</ref> These images provided visual stories which often placed captions below the images to explain a moral message.\n\nThe earliest examples of text comics are the Swiss comics series ''[[Histoire de M. Vieux Bois]]'' (1827) by [[Rodolphe T\u00f6pffer]], the French comics ''Les Travaux d'Hercule'' (1847), ''Trois artistes incompris et m\u00e9contents'' (1851), ''Les D\u00e9s-agr\u00e9ments d'un voyage d'agr\u00e9ment'' (1851) and ''L'Histoire de la Sainte Russie'' (1854) by [[Gustave Dor\u00e9]], the German ''[[Max und Moritz]]'' (1866) by [[Wilhelm Busch]] and the British ''[[Ally Sloper]]'' (1867) by [[Charles Henry Ross]] and [[\u00c9milie de Tessier]]. T\u00f6pffer often put considerable effort in the narrative captions of his graphic narratives, which made them just as distinctive and appealing as the drawings. [[Wilhelm Busch]] used rhyming [[couplet]]s in his captions.<ref name=\"google1\"/>\n\nDuring the 19th century and the first half of the 20th century text comics were the dominant form in Europe. In the United States of America the speech balloon made its entry in comics with 1895's ''[[The Yellow Kid]]'' by [[Richard F. Outcault]]. [[Frederick Burr Opper]]'s ''[[Happy Hooligan]]'' and ''[[Alphonse and Gaston]]'' further popularized the technique.<ref name=\"imageandnarrative1\"/> As speech balloons asked for less text to read and had the advantage of linking the dialogues directly to the characters who were speaking or thinking, they allowed readers to connect better with the stories. By the early 1900s most American newspaper comics had switched to the speech balloon format.<ref name=\"imageandnarrative1\"/>\n\n<!-- [[WP:NFCC]] violation: [[Image:Totor the Boy Scout.gif|thumb| ''[[The Adventures of Totor]]'' (1926) by [[Herg\u00e9]], depicting text below the images.]] -->\nWhile speech balloon comics became the norm in the United States, the format didn't always catch on as well in the rest of the world. In Mexico and [[Argentina]] speech balloons were adapted very quickly,<ref name=\"imageandnarrative1\"/> while in Europe they remained a rarity until deep in the 1920s. In other parts of Europe, most notably the Netherlands, text comics even remained dominant as late as the early 1960s.<ref name=\"imageandnarrative1\"/> Many European moral guardians looked down upon on [[comics]] as low-brow entertainment that made the youth too lazy to read. Christian comics magazines and newspapers closely supervised the content of their publications and preferred text comics, as the format still encouraged children to read actual written texts. They were also ideal to adapt classic novels and guide young readers towards \"real\" literature. In some instances foreign balloon comics were simply re-adapted by erasing the balloons and adding captions underneath them. It even happened with the European ''[[Tintin in the Land of the Soviets]]'' (1929) by Herg\u00e9, which was republished in the French magazine ''[[Coeurs Vaillants]]'', but with captions.<ref name=\"imageandnarrative1\"/> Other comics, like ''[[Pip, Squeak and Wilfred]]'' by [[Bertram Lamb]], used both speech balloons and captions.  Under the Nazi, Fascist and Communist regimes in Western and/or Eastern Europe balloon comics were even banned in favor of comics with captions underneath them.<ref name=\"imageandnarrative1\"/>\n\nThe success of ''[[The Adventures of Tintin]]'' by Herg\u00e9 from 1929 on, influenced many other European comics, especially in the [[Franco-Belgian comics]] market, to adapt speech balloons. Translations of popular American comics such as ''[[Mickey Mouse]]'', ''[[Donald Duck]]'', ''[[Popeye]]'' throughout the 1930s and especially after the liberation of Europe in 1945 further encouraged the speech balloon format. By the 1960s text comics had lost popularity worldwide and only a few remained.\n\n==Classic text comics==\n===Europe===\n====Belgium====\n* ''L' Aventure des Belges/Belgi\u00eb in Beeld'' by Louis Hach\u00e9 and Georges H.

It is the oldest form of comics and was especially dominant in [[European comics]] from the 19th century<ref name=\"imageandnarrative1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.imageandnarrative.be/inarchive/painting/pascal_levevre.htm |title=Image and Narrative \u2013 Article |publisher=Imageandnarrative.be |date= |accessdate=2015-11-18}}</ref> until the 1950s, after which it gradually lost popularity in favor of comics with speech balloons.\n\n==Definition==\n<!-- [[WP:NFCC]] violation: [[Image: Marmittone.jpg|thumb| ''[[Marmittone]]'' (1920) by [[Bruno Angoletta]].]] -->\n \nA text comic is published as a series of illustrations that can be read as a continuous story. However, within the illustrations themselves no text is used: no [[speech balloon]]s, no [[onomatopoeia]]s, no written indications to explain where the action takes place or how much time has passed. In order to understand what is happening in the drawings the reader has to read the captions below each image, where the story is written out in the same style as a novel.\n\nMuch like other comics text comics were pre-published in newspapers and weekly comics magazines as a continuous story, told in daily or weekly episodes. When published in book format the comics were sometimes published as actual illustrated novels. In some cases the original text was kept, but only a few drawings were used as illustrations, rather than the entire comic. In the Netherlands text comics were published in small rectangular books, called [[Rectangle|oblong]] books, due to the shape of the books.\n\n==History==\n<!-- [[WP:NFCC]] violation: [[Image:Quadratino.jpg|thumb| ''[[Quadratino]]'' (1910) by Italian artist [[Antonio Rubino]] is an example of a text comic.]] -->\n\nText comics are older than balloon comics. Ancient Egyptian wall paintings with [[hieroglyphs]] explaining the images are the oldest predecessors. In the late 17th century and early 19th century picture narratives were popular in Western Europe, such as ''[[Les Grandes Mis\u00e8res de la guerre]] (1633)'' by [[Jacques Callot]], ''History of the Hellish Popish Plot (1682)'' by [[Francis Barlow (artist)|Francis Barlow]], the cartoons of [[William Hogarth]], [[Thomas Rowlandson]] and [[George Cruikshank]].<ref name=\"google1\">{{cite web|url=https://books.google.be/books?id=2RFaCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA132&lpg=PA132&dq=comic+captions+told+below+the+illustrations&source=bl&ots=IOHB7qU7X6&sig=1NRGddqq0cKKkUvcYPx93EyU0Zc&hl=nl&sa=X&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=comic%20captions%20told%20below%20the%20illustrations&f=false |title=Transforming Anthony Trollope: Dispossession, Victorianism and Nineteenth ... |author=Laurence Grove |page=132 |publisher=Books.google.be |date=13 August 2015 |accessdate=2015-11-18}}</ref> These images provided visual stories which often placed captions below the images to explain a moral message.\n\nThe earliest examples of text comics are the Swiss comics series ''[[Histoire de M. Vieux Bois]]'' (1827) by [[Rodolphe T\u00f6pffer]], the French comics ''Les Travaux d'Hercule'' (1847), ''Trois artistes incompris et m\u00e9contents'' (1851), ''Les D\u00e9s-agr\u00e9ments d'un voyage d'agr\u00e9ment'' (1851) and ''L'Histoire de la Sainte Russie'' (1854) by [[Gustave Dor\u00e9]], the German ''[[Max und Moritz]]'' (1866) by [[Wilhelm Busch]] and the British ''[[Ally Sloper]]'' (1867) by [[Charles Henry Ross]] and [[\u00c9milie de Tessier]]. T\u00f6pffer often put considerable effort in the narrative captions of his graphic narratives, which made them just as distinctive and appealing as the drawings. [[Wilhelm Busch]] used rhyming [[couplet]]s in his captions.<ref name=\"google1\"/>\n\nDuring the 19th century and the first half of the 20th century text comics were the dominant form in Europe. In the United States of America the speech balloon made its entry in comics with 1895's ''[[The Yellow Kid]]'' by [[Richard F. Outcault]]. [[Frederick Burr Opper]]'s ''[[Happy Hooligan]]'' and ''[[Alphonse and Gaston]]'' further popularized the technique.<ref name=\"imageandnarrative1\"/> As speech balloons asked for less text to read and had the advantage of linking the dialogues directly to the characters who were speaking or thinking, they allowed readers to connect better with the stories. By the early 1900s most American newspaper comics had switched to the speech balloon format.<ref name=\"imageandnarrative1\"/>\n\n<!-- [[WP:NFCC]] violation: [[Image:Totor the Boy Scout.gif|thumb| ''[[The Adventures of Totor]]'' (1926) by [[Herg\u00e9]], depicting text below the images.]] -->\nWhile speech balloon comics became the norm in the United States, the format didn't always catch on as well in the rest of the world. In Mexico and [[Argentina]] speech balloons were adapted very quickly,<ref name=\"imageandnarrative1\"/> while in Europe they remained a rarity until deep in the 1920s. In other parts of Europe, most notably the Netherlands, text comics even remained dominant as late as the early 1960s.<ref name=\"imageandnarrative1\"/> Many European moral guardians looked down upon on [[comics]] as low-brow entertainment that made the youth too lazy to read. Christian comics magazines and newspapers closely supervised the content of their publications and preferred text comics, as the format still encouraged children to read actual written texts. They were also ideal to adapt classic novels and guide young readers towards \"real\" literature. In some instances foreign balloon comics were simply re-adapted by erasing the balloons and adding captions underneath them. It even happened with the European ''[[Tintin in the Land of the Soviets]]'' (1929) by Herg\u00e9, which was republished in the French magazine ''[[Coeurs Vaillants]]'', but with captions.<ref name=\"imageandnarrative1\"/> Other comics, like ''[[Pip, Squeak and Wilfred]]'' by [[Bertram Lamb]], used both speech balloons and captions.  Under the Nazi, Fascist and Communist regimes in Western and/or Eastern Europe balloon comics were even banned in favor of comics with captions underneath them.<ref name=\"imageandnarrative1\"/>\n\nThe success of ''[[The Adventures of Tintin]]'' by Herg\u00e9 from 1929 on, influenced many other European comics, especially in the [[Franco-Belgian comics]] market, to adapt speech balloons. Translations of popular American comics such as ''[[Mickey Mouse]]'', ''[[Donald Duck]]'', ''[[Popeye]]'' throughout the 1930s and especially after the liberation of Europe in 1945 further encouraged the speech balloon format. By the 1960s text comics had lost popularity worldwide and only a few remained.\n\n==Classic text comics==\n===Europe===\n====Belgium====\n* ''L' Aventure des Belges/Belgi\u00eb in Beeld'' by Louis Hach\u00e9 and Georges H.

McElroy]]. It stars [[Sam Worthington]], [[Lily Rabe]], [[Stephen Tobolowsky]], [[Adjoa Andoh]], and Lucy Capri.\n\nThe film had its world premiere at [[Fantastic Fest]] on September 22, 2019. It was released on October 11, 2019, by [[Netflix]].\n\n==Plot==\nRay, along with his wife Joanne and daughter Peri, drive on a road trip for Thanksgiving. In the car, it is clear that Ray and his wife are having issues in their relationship. Joanne thinks that Ray is not himself anymore and they do not laugh together like they used to. Eventually, Peri needs to use the restroom so they take a break at a rest stop. At the gas station, because Ray is low on cash, he can only choose to buy three of four items. A soft drink for his wife, batteries for his daughter's music player, or a cup of coffee and some small shots of alcohol for himself. Ray chooses to buy his wife a soft drink and the coffee and alcohol for himself. While Joanne goes to check the restroom, Ray helps Peri find her portable mirror. While Ray is distracted and trying to find the mirror, Peri unknowingly walks close to the edge of an open construction pit. A stray dog then appears and slowly approaches Peri, forcing her to backup towards the construction pit. After Peri yells to get Ray's attention, Ray decides to throw a rock to scare the dog which inadvertently causes Peri to fall into the open construction site and are injured. We then see Ray waking up after being unconscious from the fall. He is confused and staring at a daze at Peri on the floor. Joanne's muffled voice can be heard yelling at Ray to do something. Ray then quickly turns away from the scene and takes a deep breath. He opens his eyes and realizes what he should do. He helps Peri up and decides to bring her to a nearby hospital. Ray speeds through traffic to get to the hospital. After rushing to the hospital, Joanne accompanies Peri to the basement to obtain a CT scan while Ray waits in the waiting room. \n\nRay passes out from exhaustion. After awakening hours later, he asks the hospital staff if he can see his wife and daughter, but is told they were never brought to the hospital.\n\nRay argues with the hospital staff, who all deny that his wife and daughter were ever admitted. Ray enlists the assistance of two police officers, but the hospital staff and doctors convince them Ray came to the hospital alone, was treated for a head wound, and is confused.\n\nUnable to convince the staff and police of his story, Ray searches for his family on his own and eventually finds them in the sub-basement, just before his daughter is about to have her organs harvested. Ray fights with the hospital staff, causing an explosion, and escapes with his family.\n\nHowever, as Ray drives away, it is revealed that he is experiencing visual hallucinations from psychological trauma resulting from the incident earlier that day. In reality, Peri died from the fall, and Ray accidentally killed Joanne after pushing her. The trauma of realizing he had killed his family caused Ray's mind to construct a new reality in which both his wife and daughter are alive. Ray believes he is rescuing them, but it is revealed that he has kidnapped a random patient from surgery, while his wife and daughter are lying dead in the trunk of his car.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Sam Worthington]] as Ray Monroe\n* [[Lily Rabe]] as Joanne Monroe\n* [[Stephen Tobolowsky]] as Dr. Berthram\n* [[Adjoa Andoh]] as Dr. Isaacs\n*Shane Dean as Officer Griggs\n*Lauren Cochrane as Officer Chilches\n*Lucy Capri as Peri Monroe\n\n==Production==\nIn November 2018, [[Sam Worthington]] signed to star, with [[Brad Anderson (director)|Brad Anderson]] attached to direct [[Alan B.

The series is distributed by [[Warner Bros.]] and consists of five main films, two of which are not sponsored by ''National Lampoon'', and one spin-off. In recent years, the series has been the inspiration for various advertising campaigns featuring some of the original cast members. The series portrays the misadventures of the Griswold family, whose attempts to enjoy vacations and holidays are plagued with continual disasters and strangely embarrassing predicaments.\n\n==Films==\n\n===''National Lampoon's Vacation'' (1983)===\n{{Main|National Lampoon's Vacation}}\n\n''National Lampoon's Vacation'' was directed by [[Harold Ramis]] and written by [[John Hughes (filmmaker)|John Hughes]]. The film follows Clark and Ellen Griswold as they take their two children, Rusty and Audrey, on a cross-country trip from their home in [[Chicago]], to the [[California]] theme park Walley World. Planned out by Clark, the trip begins to go awry after getting lost in [[St. Louis]]. From there, they make it to [[Coolidge, Kansas]], where they spend the night at the home of Ellen's cousin, Catherine, and husband, Eddie. There they are forced to take their Aunt Edna and her dog to [[Phoenix, Arizona]]. Along the way to there, Clark accidentally drags the dog from the back of the car and Edna dies during a long day of driving. Dropping her body off at cousin Normy's house in Phoenix, they soon make it to Walley World only to find that it is closed.\n\n===''National Lampoon's European Vacation'' (1985)===\n{{Main|National Lampoon's European Vacation}}\n\n''National Lampoon's European Vacation'' was directed by [[Amy Heckerling]] and written by [[John Hughes (filmmaker)|John Hughes]] and Robert Klane. After becoming the winning family on a game show called \"Pig In A Poke\", the Griswalds win a two-week trip to Europe. The vacation begins in London, where they visit sights such as [[Big Ben]], [[Parliament of England|Houses of Parliament]] and [[Buckingham Palace]]. Having trouble with driving on the left side of the road, Clark ends up in many accidents and unknowingly knocks down [[Stonehenge]]. From there they stop in France, where their camcorder gets stolen; in [[West Germany]], where they spend the night at the home of strangers they mistake for their relatives; and in Italy, where they become involved with robbery and kidnapping.\n\nThis is the first of two ''Vacation'' films to not feature the [[Randy Quaid]] \"Cousin Eddie\" character. The second film is the 2015 ''[[Vacation (2015 film)|Vacation]]''.\n\nIn the opening \"Pig in a Poke\" sequence as well as the closing credits, the family's name is spelled as \"Grisw'''a'''ld\" as opposed to \"Grisw'''o'''ld\".\n\n===''National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation'' (1989)===\n{{Main|National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation}}\n\n''National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation'' was directed by [[Jeremiah S. Chechik]] and written by [[John Hughes (filmmaker)|John Hughes]]. The film follows Clark's attempt at delivering \"the most fun-filled old-fashioned family Christmas ever\". As the Griswolds' dysfunctional relatives begin arriving early, he becomes obsessed with ensuring that everything goes right. Meanwhile, he is also expecting a large Christmas bonus check that will cover a surprise backyard swimming pool that he already ordered. However, when the Christmas bonuses are cut, he instead receives a one-year membership to the Jelly of the Month Club, causing him to snap and go crazy.\n\n===''Vegas Vacation'' (1997)===\n{{Main|Vegas Vacation}}\n\n''Vegas Vacation'' was directed by Stephen Kessler and written by Elisa Bell, based on a story by Bell and [[Bob Ducsay]]. After receiving a large bonus check, Clark takes his family on vacation to [[Las Vegas]]. Immediately hitting the blackjack tables, he begins to blow all his money, resulting in them breaking off in their own directions. While he tries to regain his money through the help of his cousin-in-law, Eddie, Ellen becomes infatuated with [[Wayne Newton]] as Rusty wins big at the dice tables and Audrey turns to go-go dancing with her cousin, Vicki. The film is notable for being the first (and to date, only) installment to receive a PG rating from the MPAA.\n\n===''Vacation'' (2015)===\n{{Main|Vacation (2015 film)}}\n\n''Vacation'' is a 2015 theatrical installment of the series written and directed by [[John Francis Daley]] and [[Jonathan Goldstein (screenwriter)|Jonathan Goldstein]]. Following in Clark's footsteps, a grown-up Rusty Griswold ([[Ed Helms]]) surprises his wife, Debbie ([[Christina Applegate]]), and their two sons, James ([[Skyler Gisondo]]) and Kevin (Steele Stebbins), with a cross-country road trip back to Walley World, in an effort to recreate the family vacations he had with his parents and sister ([[Leslie Mann]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.denofgeek.us/movies/vacation/239208/a-new-vacation-movie-begins-today-synopsis-revealed|title=A New Vacation (Movie) Begins Today, Synopsis Revealed|work=Den of Geek|accessdate=7 October 2014}}</ref>  It is the first entry since the original to receive an R rating.\n\n==Short film==\n\n===''Hotel Hell Vacation'' (2010)===\n{{Main|Hotel Hell Vacation}}\n\n''Hotel Hell Vacation'' is a short film directed by [[Bryan Buckley]]. On their way to visit Rusty and his family at a [[vacation rental]], Clark and Ellen decide to have a romantic getaway at a hotel before they get there. Everything goes wrong and they hastily make their way to Rusty's rental.\n\nThe film was a campaign ad for [[HomeAway]] that originally aired in part during the broadcast of [[Super Bowl XLIV]] and in entirety on Homeaway.com.<ref>{{cite web|title=Exclusive: Chevy Chase, Beverly D'Angelo to Reprise Vacation Roles|url=http://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/chevy-chase-beverly-dangelo-to-reprise-vacation-roles-20091811|work=[[Us Weekly]]|accessdate=December 22, 2012|date=November 18, 2009}}</ref> While it was sanctioned by Warner Bros., it was not sponsored by the National Lampoon label.\n\n==Television==\n\n===''National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation 2'' (2003)===\n{{Main|National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation 2}}\n\n''National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation 2: Cousin Eddie's Island Adventure'' is a [[Television movie|made-for-TV]] spin-off film directed by [[Nick Marck]] and written by [[Matty Simmons]]. After a workplace accident involving a monkey, Eddie Johnson is given a free vacation for him and his family to an island in the South Pacific. But when he tries to catch a shark during a family boat trip, they become lost and eventually shipwrecked on an isolated island.\n\nIt can be considered a sequel to ''[[National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation]]'', although it is more of a spin-off than a direct chapter in the ''Vacation'' series, because [[Chevy Chase]] and [[Beverly D'Angelo]] do not appear. It stars [[Randy Quaid]] and [[Miriam Flynn]], reprising their roles as Cousin Eddie and Catherine, with [[Dana Barron]] returning as Audrey Griswold.\n\n===''The Goldbergs''===\n[[Christie Brinkley]] and [[Anthony Michael Hall]] respectively reprised their roles as the Girl in the Red Ferrari and Rusty Griswold in the [[The Goldbergs (season 7)|seventh season]] of the television series ''[[The Goldbergs (2013 TV series)|The Goldbergs]]''.<ref>https://deadline.com/2019/08/the-goldbergs-national-lampoons-vacation-season-7-premiere-christie-brinkley-anthony-michael-hall-guest-star-1202661280/</ref>\n\n===''The Griswolds''===\nIn December 2019, a television spin-off series entitled ''The Griswolds'' entered development.

Hughes wrote the screenplay for the first ''Vacation'' film as \"a fairly straight adaptation of the short story\", with the exception of the ending that was rewritten and reshot after being \"thoroughly despised by preview audiences\".<ref>{{cite web|last=Hughes|first=John|title=Vacation '58 / Foreword '08|url=http://www.all-story.com/issues.cgi?action=show_story&story_id=389|publisher=[[American Zoetrope]]|accessdate=December 18, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080731165748/http://www.all-story.com/issues.cgi?action=show_story&story_id=389|archive-date=July 31, 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref> In addition to Hughes, ''Vacation'' involved the crew of many people connected to ''National Lampoon''. The film was produced by ''Lampoon'' co-founder and ''Animal House'' producer, [[Matty Simmons]], and directed by ''Lampoon'' alumnus and ''Animal House'' co-writer [[Harold Ramis]].\n\nReleased on July 29, 1983, ''National Lampoon's Vacation'' proved to be a financial and critical success. Simmons went on to produce two sequels, with scripts by Hughes. While involved with the early stages of a third sequel, ''Vegas Vacation'', Simmons resigned from production due to creative differences.<ref>{{cite web |last=Patrizio |first=Andy |title=An Interview with Matty Simmons |url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2003/10/31/an-interview-with-matty-simmons?page=1 |work=[[News Corporation (1980\u20132013)|News Corporation]] |publisher=[[IGN]] |accessdate=December 19, 2012 |date=October 31, 2003}}</ref> As a result, the film was made without the \"National Lampoon\" title.\n\nDuring an interview on the [[TBS (U.S. TV channel)|TBS]] series ''[[Dinner and a Movie]]'', [[Beverly D'Angelo]] revealed that due to the success of ''Animal House'', the original ''Vacation'' was envisioned as a raunchier R-rated comedy targeting young adults.<ref>{{cite web |last=Gurwitch |first=Annabelle |title=Time for a Vacation! |url=http://cgi.superstation.com/d_and_m/articles/annabelle080699.htm |publisher=[[TBS (U.S. TV channel)|TBS Superstation, Inc.]] |accessdate=February 28, 2013 |date=August 6, 1999}}</ref> This was principally the reason for nudity such as D'Angelo's shower scene, and Chase's profanity-laced tirades and pool scene with [[Christie Brinkley]]. However, the movie's success with larger family audiences who identified with Chase's everyman-father character caught the filmmakers by surprise. As a result, the subsequent sequels prior to the 2015 R-rated revival were toned down and family friendly, with PG-13 or PG ratings.\n\n===Casting===\nAlong with [[John Belushi]], who starred in ''Animal House'', [[Chevy Chase]] had previously performed in ''[[The National Lampoon Radio Hour]]'' and in the stage show ''[[National Lampoon Lemmings]]'', both of which were spin-offs from ''National Lampoon'' magazine.<ref>{{cite web |last=Evans |first=Bradford |title=Talking to Matty Simmons About Producing Animal House, Publishing National Lampoon, and His New Book Fat, Drunk, and Stupid |url=http://splitsider.com/2012/04/talking-to-matty-simmons-about-producing-animal-house-publishing-national-lampoon-and-his-new-book-fat-drunk-and-stupid/ |publisher=[[Splitsider]] |accessdate=December 18, 2012 |date=April 10, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120412033140/http://splitsider.com/2012/04/talking-to-matty-simmons-about-producing-animal-house-publishing-national-lampoon-and-his-new-book-fat-drunk-and-stupid/ |archive-date=April 12, 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nIn each of the main films of the series, the Griswold children are portrayed by different actors.

It is assumed that each film takes place in the year they are actually filmed, as no other indication of time is mentioned and the characters' clothing, cars, and environment are contemporary to the time of each film's release. In most of the films it is never mentioned which of the two children is older. Rusty and Audrey appear to be in their early teens in ''Vacation'' (1983), and in their mid-teens in ''European Vacation'' (1985) two years later (at one point in the film, he specifically mentions that he is fifteen years old). However, in ''Christmas Vacation'' (1989), while she appears to be in her late teens, he looks younger than he did in the preceding films. Whereas in ''Vegas Vacation'' (1997), both are in their late teens to which Clark tells the kids, \"I hardly recognize you anymore!\" The next shot freezes for a moment on the kids sitting silently, making fun of the discontinuity.\n\n[[Dana Barron]], who was then in her late thirties, reprised the role of Audrey in ''Christmas Vacation 2'' (2003). Rusty is also portrayed as an adult with a wife and daughter in ''[[Hotel Hell Vacation]]'' (2010). However, in ''[[Vacation (2015 film)|Vacation]]'' (2015), Rusty is portrayed by [[Ed Helms]] and has two sons with no mention of a daughter.\n\n====Eddie and Catherine Johnson====\nEddie and Catherine are seen with the following children in their respective films: Vicky, Dale, Daisy Mable, Eddie Jr, and Junior (''Vacation''); Rocky and Ruby Sue (''Christmas Vacation''); Denny (''Vegas Vacation''); and Clark \"Third\" Johnson \u2014 the namesake of Clark Griswold (''Christmas Vacation 2''). In addition to those seen, several others are mentioned or alluded to throughout the series. While the Johnsons do not appear in the 2015 ''Vacation'', Eddie is mentioned once. Since Clark refers to Eddie as his cousin-in-law in ''Christmas Vacation'' - hence generally being referred to as 'Cousin Eddie' - it's presumed that Catherine is a cousin of Ellen. In \"Vegas Vacation,\" however, Ellen directly asks Clark how often she gets to see her \"cousin,\" Catherine.\n\n====Walley World====\nWalley World is mentioned in subsequent films following ''Vacation'':\n* In ''European Vacation'', Clark tells his wife and children to be open-minded and respectful of other countries' cultures, reminding them, ''\"This isn't Walley World, it's a country.\"'' Clark and Rusty also wear Walley World sweaters at certain points in the film.\n* In ''Christmas Vacation'', Clark and Eddie can be seen drinking eggnog out of glasses shaped like Marty Moose's head (with the cartoonish oversized antlers serving as handles).\n* In ''Hotel Hell'', Rusty can be seen wearing a Marty Moose T-shirt.\n* Walley World once again makes an appearance in the 2015 ''Vacation''. In the film, the park appears to be updated with new attractions and modernized signage, including a statue of Marty Moose taking a selfie.\n\n====Clark's tirades====\nClark is usually very easy-going and optimistic, even in the face of adversity and his family's seeming lack of appreciation for his efforts on their behalf. However, when he is pushed beyond the limit of his patience, he tends to lose his temper and go on furious tirades, as seen in the first ''Vacation'', where he scolds his family for not wanting to continue the trip. He also loses his temper in ''Christmas Vacation'' where he gets angry at his relatives because of their wanting to leave, and went into a tirade against his boss.\n\n====The Girl in the Red Ferrari====\nIn the first ''Vacation'' film, Clark sees a golden-haired beauty driving a red [[Ferrari]] played by model and actress [[Christie Brinkley]]. Clark later encounters her at a hotel, with her attempts to seduce him resulting in an embarrassing failure on his behalf. In ''Vegas Vacation'', Clark once again drives alongside the same woman (again played by Brinkley), asking \"remember me?\" After she responds that she does, Clark spots a baby in the backseat of her car, clearly indicating she's now a mom and possibly married \u2014 much to Clark's disappointment.\n\nA new girl in a red Ferrari played by model [[Hannah Davis (model)|Hannah Davis]] appears in the 2015 ''Vacation''. This time, while driving down the highway, the girl pulls alongside Rusty and makes flirtatious gestures at him before swerving into the other lane, being hit head on and killed by a [[semi-truck]].<ref>http://starcasm.net/archives/314822</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Box office performance===\nWhen released in 1983, ''National Lampoon's Vacation'' was a significant [[box office|box-office]] hit.

The series is distributed by [[Warner Bros.]] and consists of five main films, two of which are not sponsored by ''National Lampoon'', and one spin-off. In recent years, the series has been the inspiration for various advertising campaigns featuring some of the original cast members. The series portrays the misadventures of the Griswold family, whose attempts to enjoy vacations and holidays are plagued with continual disasters and strangely embarrassing predicaments.\n\n==Films==\n\n===''National Lampoon's Vacation'' (1983)===\n{{Main|National Lampoon's Vacation}}\n\n''National Lampoon's Vacation'' was directed by [[Harold Ramis]] and written by [[John Hughes (filmmaker)|John Hughes]]. The film follows Clark and Ellen Griswold as they take their two children, Rusty and Audrey, on a cross-country trip from their home in [[Chicago]], to the [[California]] theme park Walley World. Planned out by Clark, the trip begins to go awry after getting lost in [[St. Louis]]. From there, they make it to [[Coolidge, Kansas]], where they spend the night at the home of Ellen's cousin, Catherine, and husband, Eddie. There they are forced to take their Aunt Edna and her dog to [[Phoenix, Arizona]]. Along the way to there, Clark accidentally drags the dog from the back of the car and Edna dies during a long day of driving. Dropping her body off at cousin Normy's house in Phoenix, they soon make it to Walley World only to find that it is closed.\n\n===''National Lampoon's European Vacation'' (1985)===\n{{Main|National Lampoon's European Vacation}}\n\n''National Lampoon's European Vacation'' was directed by [[Amy Heckerling]] and written by [[John Hughes (filmmaker)|John Hughes]] and Robert Klane. After becoming the winning family on a game show called \"Pig In A Poke\", the Griswalds win a two-week trip to Europe. The vacation begins in London, where they visit sights such as [[Big Ben]], [[Parliament of England|Houses of Parliament]] and [[Buckingham Palace]]. Having trouble with driving on the left side of the road, Clark ends up in many accidents and unknowingly knocks down [[Stonehenge]]. From there they stop in France, where their camcorder gets stolen; in [[West Germany]], where they spend the night at the home of strangers they mistake for their relatives; and in Italy, where they become involved with robbery and kidnapping.\n\nThis is the first of two ''Vacation'' films to not feature the [[Randy Quaid]] \"Cousin Eddie\" character. The second film is the 2015 ''[[Vacation (2015 film)|Vacation]]''.\n\nIn the opening \"Pig in a Poke\" sequence as well as the closing credits, the family's name is spelled as \"Grisw'''a'''ld\" as opposed to \"Grisw'''o'''ld\".\n\n===''National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation'' (1989)===\n{{Main|National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation}}\n\n''National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation'' was directed by [[Jeremiah S. Chechik]] and written by [[John Hughes (filmmaker)|John Hughes]]. The film follows Clark's attempt at delivering \"the most fun-filled old-fashioned family Christmas ever\". As the Griswolds' dysfunctional relatives begin arriving early, he becomes obsessed with ensuring that everything goes right. Meanwhile, he is also expecting a large Christmas bonus check that will cover a surprise backyard swimming pool that he already ordered. However, when the Christmas bonuses are cut, he instead receives a one-year membership to the Jelly of the Month Club, causing him to snap and go crazy.\n\n===''Vegas Vacation'' (1997)===\n{{Main|Vegas Vacation}}\n\n''Vegas Vacation'' was directed by Stephen Kessler and written by Elisa Bell, based on a story by Bell and [[Bob Ducsay]]. After receiving a large bonus check, Clark takes his family on vacation to [[Las Vegas]]. Immediately hitting the blackjack tables, he begins to blow all his money, resulting in them breaking off in their own directions. While he tries to regain his money through the help of his cousin-in-law, Eddie, Ellen becomes infatuated with [[Wayne Newton]] as Rusty wins big at the dice tables and Audrey turns to go-go dancing with her cousin, Vicki. The film is notable for being the first (and to date, only) installment to receive a PG rating from the MPAA.\n\n===''Vacation'' (2015)===\n{{Main|Vacation (2015 film)}}\n\n''Vacation'' is a 2015 theatrical installment of the series written and directed by [[John Francis Daley]] and [[Jonathan Goldstein (screenwriter)|Jonathan Goldstein]]. Following in Clark's footsteps, a grown-up Rusty Griswold ([[Ed Helms]]) surprises his wife, Debbie ([[Christina Applegate]]), and their two sons, James ([[Skyler Gisondo]]) and Kevin (Steele Stebbins), with a cross-country road trip back to Walley World, in an effort to recreate the family vacations he had with his parents and sister ([[Leslie Mann]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.denofgeek.us/movies/vacation/239208/a-new-vacation-movie-begins-today-synopsis-revealed|title=A New Vacation (Movie) Begins Today, Synopsis Revealed|work=Den of Geek|accessdate=7 October 2014}}</ref>  It is the first entry since the original to receive an R rating.\n\n==Short film==\n\n===''Hotel Hell Vacation'' (2010)===\n{{Main|Hotel Hell Vacation}}\n\n''Hotel Hell Vacation'' is a short film directed by [[Bryan Buckley]].

After a workplace accident involving a monkey, Eddie Johnson is given a free vacation for him and his family to an island in the South Pacific. But when he tries to catch a shark during a family boat trip, they become lost and eventually shipwrecked on an isolated island.\n\nIt can be considered a sequel to ''[[National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation]]'', although it is more of a spin-off than a direct chapter in the ''Vacation'' series, because [[Chevy Chase]] and [[Beverly D'Angelo]] do not appear.

Hughes wrote the screenplay for the first ''Vacation'' film as \"a fairly straight adaptation of the short story\", with the exception of the ending that was rewritten and reshot after being \"thoroughly despised by preview audiences\".<ref>{{cite web|last=Hughes|first=John|title=Vacation '58 / Foreword '08|url=http://www.all-story.com/issues.cgi?action=show_story&story_id=389|publisher=[[American Zoetrope]]|accessdate=December 18, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080731165748/http://www.all-story.com/issues.cgi?action=show_story&story_id=389|archive-date=July 31, 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref> In addition to Hughes, ''Vacation'' involved the crew of many people connected to ''National Lampoon''. The film was produced by ''Lampoon'' co-founder and ''Animal House'' producer, [[Matty Simmons]], and directed by ''Lampoon'' alumnus and ''Animal House'' co-writer [[Harold Ramis]].\n\nReleased on July 29, 1983, ''National Lampoon's Vacation'' proved to be a financial and critical success. Simmons went on to produce two sequels, with scripts by Hughes. While involved with the early stages of a third sequel, ''Vegas Vacation'', Simmons resigned from production due to creative differences.<ref>{{cite web |last=Patrizio |first=Andy |title=An Interview with Matty Simmons |url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2003/10/31/an-interview-with-matty-simmons?page=1 |work=[[News Corporation (1980\u20132013)|News Corporation]] |publisher=[[IGN]] |accessdate=December 19, 2012 |date=October 31, 2003}}</ref> As a result, the film was made without the \"National Lampoon\" title.\n\nDuring an interview on the [[TBS (U.S. TV channel)|TBS]] series ''[[Dinner and a Movie]]'', [[Beverly D'Angelo]] revealed that due to the success of ''Animal House'', the original ''Vacation'' was envisioned as a raunchier R-rated comedy targeting young adults.<ref>{{cite web |last=Gurwitch |first=Annabelle |title=Time for a Vacation! |url=http://cgi.superstation.com/d_and_m/articles/annabelle080699.htm |publisher=[[TBS (U.S. TV channel)|TBS Superstation, Inc.]] |accessdate=February 28, 2013 |date=August 6, 1999}}</ref> This was principally the reason for nudity such as D'Angelo's shower scene, and Chase's profanity-laced tirades and pool scene with [[Christie Brinkley]]. However, the movie's success with larger family audiences who identified with Chase's everyman-father character caught the filmmakers by surprise. As a result, the subsequent sequels prior to the 2015 R-rated revival were toned down and family friendly, with PG-13 or PG ratings.\n\n===Casting===\nAlong with [[John Belushi]], who starred in ''Animal House'', [[Chevy Chase]] had previously performed in ''[[The National Lampoon Radio Hour]]'' and in the stage show ''[[National Lampoon Lemmings]]'', both of which were spin-offs from ''National Lampoon'' magazine.<ref>{{cite web |last=Evans |first=Bradford |title=Talking to Matty Simmons About Producing Animal House, Publishing National Lampoon, and His New Book Fat, Drunk, and Stupid |url=http://splitsider.com/2012/04/talking-to-matty-simmons-about-producing-animal-house-publishing-national-lampoon-and-his-new-book-fat-drunk-and-stupid/ |publisher=[[Splitsider]] |accessdate=December 18, 2012 |date=April 10, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120412033140/http://splitsider.com/2012/04/talking-to-matty-simmons-about-producing-animal-house-publishing-national-lampoon-and-his-new-book-fat-drunk-and-stupid/ |archive-date=April 12, 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nIn each of the main films of the series, the Griswold children are portrayed by different actors. This is usually attributed to the fact that after [[Anthony Michael Hall]] declined to reprise his role in ''European Vacation'' in order to star in ''[[Weird Science (film)|Weird Science]]'', Director [[Amy Heckerling]] requested both children be recast.<ref>{{cite AV media |people=[[Michael Yo]], [[Dana Barron]]|year=2013|title=Michael Yo interviews Dana Barron about ''Vacation''|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_kbrkbqFMo|access-date=August 12, 2015|publisher=The Yo Show}}</ref> Chase has indicated that it was his idea to continue recasting the children by explaining, \"I always wanted to make the joke, 'Geez, I hardly ever get the chance to see the kids anymore.

It is assumed that each film takes place in the year they are actually filmed, as no other indication of time is mentioned and the characters' clothing, cars, and environment are contemporary to the time of each film's release. In most of the films it is never mentioned which of the two children is older. Rusty and Audrey appear to be in their early teens in ''Vacation'' (1983), and in their mid-teens in ''European Vacation'' (1985) two years later (at one point in the film, he specifically mentions that he is fifteen years old). However, in ''Christmas Vacation'' (1989), while she appears to be in her late teens, he looks younger than he did in the preceding films. Whereas in ''Vegas Vacation'' (1997), both are in their late teens to which Clark tells the kids, \"I hardly recognize you anymore!\" The next shot freezes for a moment on the kids sitting silently, making fun of the discontinuity.\n\n[[Dana Barron]], who was then in her late thirties, reprised the role of Audrey in ''Christmas Vacation 2'' (2003). Rusty is also portrayed as an adult with a wife and daughter in ''[[Hotel Hell Vacation]]'' (2010). However, in ''[[Vacation (2015 film)|Vacation]]'' (2015), Rusty is portrayed by [[Ed Helms]] and has two sons with no mention of a daughter.\n\n====Eddie and Catherine Johnson====\nEddie and Catherine are seen with the following children in their respective films: Vicky, Dale, Daisy Mable, Eddie Jr, and Junior (''Vacation''); Rocky and Ruby Sue (''Christmas Vacation''); Denny (''Vegas Vacation''); and Clark \"Third\" Johnson \u2014 the namesake of Clark Griswold (''Christmas Vacation 2''). In addition to those seen, several others are mentioned or alluded to throughout the series. While the Johnsons do not appear in the 2015 ''Vacation'', Eddie is mentioned once. Since Clark refers to Eddie as his cousin-in-law in ''Christmas Vacation'' - hence generally being referred to as 'Cousin Eddie' - it's presumed that Catherine is a cousin of Ellen. In \"Vegas Vacation,\" however, Ellen directly asks Clark how often she gets to see her \"cousin,\" Catherine.\n\n====Walley World====\nWalley World is mentioned in subsequent films following ''Vacation'':\n* In ''European Vacation'', Clark tells his wife and children to be open-minded and respectful of other countries' cultures, reminding them, ''\"This isn't Walley World, it's a country.\"'' Clark and Rusty also wear Walley World sweaters at certain points in the film.\n* In ''Christmas Vacation'', Clark and Eddie can be seen drinking eggnog out of glasses shaped like Marty Moose's head (with the cartoonish oversized antlers serving as handles).\n* In ''Hotel Hell'', Rusty can be seen wearing a Marty Moose T-shirt.\n* Walley World once again makes an appearance in the 2015 ''Vacation''. In the film, the park appears to be updated with new attractions and modernized signage, including a statue of Marty Moose taking a selfie.\n\n====Clark's tirades====\nClark is usually very easy-going and optimistic, even in the face of adversity and his family's seeming lack of appreciation for his efforts on their behalf. However, when he is pushed beyond the limit of his patience, he tends to lose his temper and go on furious tirades, as seen in the first ''Vacation'', where he scolds his family for not wanting to continue the trip. He also loses his temper in ''Christmas Vacation'' where he gets angry at his relatives because of their wanting to leave, and went into a tirade against his boss.\n\n====The Girl in the Red Ferrari====\nIn the first ''Vacation'' film, Clark sees a golden-haired beauty driving a red [[Ferrari]] played by model and actress [[Christie Brinkley]]. Clark later encounters her at a hotel, with her attempts to seduce him resulting in an embarrassing failure on his behalf. In ''Vegas Vacation'', Clark once again drives alongside the same woman (again played by Brinkley), asking \"remember me?\" After she responds that she does, Clark spots a baby in the backseat of her car, clearly indicating she's now a mom and possibly married \u2014 much to Clark's disappointment.\n\nA new girl in a red Ferrari played by model [[Hannah Davis (model)|Hannah Davis]] appears in the 2015 ''Vacation''. This time, while driving down the highway, the girl pulls alongside Rusty and makes flirtatious gestures at him before swerving into the other lane, being hit head on and killed by a [[semi-truck]].<ref>http://starcasm.net/archives/314822</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Box office performance===\nWhen released in 1983, ''National Lampoon's Vacation'' was a significant [[box office|box-office]] hit.

The expedition took place in southeastern and central [[Asia Minor]], where the Abbasid and Byzantine empires shared a long land border.\n\nUpon coming to the throne, the [[Byzantine emperor]] [[Nikephoros I]] ({{reign|802|811}}) ceased paying the [[tribute]] agreed to by his predecessors with the Caliphate, and launched attacks on the Abbasid [[al-Awasim|frontier regions]]. The [[Abbasid caliph]], [[Harun al-Rashid]] ({{reign|786|809}}), who sought to promote himself as a champion of ''[[jihad]]'', decided to lead in person a retaliatory attack with the objective of punishing the Byzantines and impressing Abassid might upon their emperor.\n\nHarun assembled his army at [[Raqqa]] in northern Syria. Medieval historians record numbers to be as high as 135,000 or even 300,000 men. While these are clearly exaggerated, it is clear that the Abbasid force assembled for the invasion was far larger than anything seen before. The Abbasid army set out from Raqqa on 11 June 806, crossed the coastal region of [[Cilicia]] and the [[Taurus Mountains]], and invaded the Byzantine province of [[Cappadocia]]. The Abbasids met no opposition and raided at will, capturing several towns and fortresses. Celebrated in Arab histories was the siege, fall, and sack of the city of [[Heraclea Cybistra|Herakleia]]; its name was later given to a victory monument erected by the Caliph near Raqqa. The Byzantine losses forced Nikephoros to seek peace terms in which he offered a resumption of tribute payments in exchange for the Abbasids' withdrawal. However, this time Harun exacted an additional [[jizya|personal tax]] levied on the Emperor and his son and heir, [[Staurakios]], as a token of their submission to the Caliph.\n\nAlmost immediately following Harun's departure, Nikephoros violated the peace terms by refortifying the sacked frontier forts and stopping tribute payments. However, Harun's preoccupation with a rebellion in [[Greater Khorasan|Khurasan]], and his death three years later, prevented a reprisal on a similar scale to 806. Smaller-scale raids continued on both sides, but the [[Fourth Fitna|Abbasid civil war]], which began after 809, and the Byzantine preoccupation with the [[First Bulgarian Empire|Bulgars]] contributed to a cessation of large-scale [[Arab\u2013Byzantine wars|Arab\u2013Byzantine conflict]] for the next two decades.\n\n==Background==\nThe [[Deposition (politics)|deposition]] of Byzantine empress [[Irene of Athens]] in October 802 and the accession of [[Nikephoros I]] in her place marked the start of a more violent phase in the long history of the [[Arab\u2013Byzantine wars]]. Following a series of destructive annual raids into Byzantine [[Asia Minor]] by the [[Abbasid Caliphate]], Empress Irene apparently secured a truce with Caliph [[Harun al-Rashid]] in 798 in exchange for the annual payment of [[tribute]], repeating the terms agreed for a three-year truce after Harun's [[Abbasid invasion of Asia Minor (782)|first large-scale campaign]] into Asia Minor in 782.{{sfn|Brooks|1923|p=126}}{{sfn|Treadgold|1988|p=113}}{{sfn|Kiapidou|2002|loc=\u00a7 1. Historical background}} Nikephoros, on the other hand, was more warlike\u2014a [[Syriac language|Syriac]] source records that when he learned of Nikephoros's accession, a [[Elpidius (rebel)|Byzantine renegade]] warned the Abbasid governor of [[Upper Mesopotamia]] to \"throw away his [[silk]] and put on his armour\". In addition, the new emperor was determined to refill the treasury by, among other measures, ceasing the tribute.{{sfn|Treadgold|1988|pp=127, 130}}\n\n[[File:Solidus-Nicephorus I and Staraucius-sb1604.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.25|alt=Obverse and reverse of a medieval gold coin, showing the busts of a bearded crowned man and of a younger crowned man|Gold ''[[solidus (coin)|nomisma]]'' of Emperor [[Nikephoros I]] (left) and his son and heir, [[Staurakios]] (right)]]\nIn retaliation for the cessation of tribute and the violation of the peace agreement concluded with Irene, Harun launched a raid under his son [[al-Qasim ibn Harun al-Rashid|al-Qasim]] in spring 803.{{sfn|Bosworth|1989|pp=238\u2013239}}{{sfn|Treadgold|1988|p=131}} Nikephoros could not respond to this, as he faced a large-scale revolt of the Byzantine army of Asia Minor under its commander-in-chief, [[Bardanes Tourkos]].{{sfn|Treadgold|1988|pp=131\u2013133}} After disposing of Bardanes, Nikephoros assembled his army and marched out to meet a second, larger invasion under the Caliph in person. After Harun raided the frontier region, the two armies faced one another for two months in central Asia Minor, but it did not come to a battle: Nikephoros and Harun exchanged letters,{{efn|[[Al-Tabari]] and other Muslim sources record the texts, supposedly of Nikephoros' letter demanding the return of the tribute paid until then, and Harun's brief reply to Nikephoros, calling him \"the dog of the Byzantines\" (''kalb [[R\u00fbm|al-Rum]]''): \"O son of an infidel woman, I have read your letter, and the reply is what you will see, without you having to hear it.

Nikephoros set out to confront the Arabs, but was surprised and heavily defeated at the [[Battle of Krasos]], where he barely escaped with his life.{{sfn|Brooks|1923|p=126}}{{sfn|Kiapidou|2002|loc=\u00a7 1.

In the summer of the same year, he launched the first Byzantine raid in two decades against the Arab frontier districts or [[al-Awasim|''thugh\u016br'']] in Cilicia. The Byzantine army raided the territory surrounding the fortresses of [[Mopsuestia]] and [[Anazarbus]] and took prisoners as it went. The garrison of Mopsuestia attacked the Byzantine force and recovered most of the prisoners and spoils, but the Byzantines marched on to [[Tarsus (city)|Tarsus]], which had been refortified and repopulated on Harun's orders in 786 to strengthen the Muslim hold on Cilicia. The city fell and the entire garrison was taken captive.{{sfn|Brooks|1923|p=126}}{{sfn|Treadgold|1988|pp=135, 138\u2013139}}{{sfn|Bosworth|1989|pp=261\u2013262}}\n\nAt the same time, another Byzantine force raided the [[Upper Mesopotamia]]n ''thugh\u016br'' and unsuccessfully besieged the fortress of [[Melitene]], while a Byzantine-instigated rebellion against the local Arab garrison began in [[Cyprus]], which for over a century had been an Arab\u2013Byzantine [[condominium (international law)|condominium]].{{efn|In 688, Emperor [[Justinian II]] and the [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad caliph]] [[Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan]] concluded an agreement whereby Cyprus became a neutral territory, its tax revenue shared between Byzantium and the Caliphate, and its ports open to both powers, including for military purposes against one another. Apart from a brief Byzantine reoccupation under [[Basil I]], this status lasted until 965, when the island was reincorporated into the Byzantine Empire.{{sfn|ODB|loc=\"Cyprus\" (T. E.

As the historian [[Warren Treadgold]] writes, if the Byzantines had been successful in this endeavour, \"garrisoning Tarsus and Melitene would have partly blocked the main Arab invasion routes across the Taurus into the Byzantine heartland, to the Byzantines' great benefit\". On the other hand, Nikephoros was certainly aware of the huge superiority of the Caliphate in men and resources, and it is more likely that he intended this campaign simply as a show of strength and a test of his enemy's resolve.{{sfn|Treadgold|1988|p=139}}\n\n==Campaign==\nHaving settled matters in Khurasan by confirming Ibn Mahan in his governorship,{{sfn|Bosworth|1989|pp=253\u2013254}} Harun returned to the west in November 805 and prepared a huge retaliatory expedition for 806, drawing men from [[Bilad al-Sham|Syria]], [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], [[Medieval Persia|Persia]], and [[Medieval Egypt|Egypt]].

Al-Tabari reports that Harun put on a cap with the inscription \"Warrior for the Faith and Pilgrim\" (in Arabic, \"''[[Ghazi (warrior)|ghazi]]'', ''[[hajj]]''\"). The Abbasids crossed Cilicia, where Harun ordered Tarsus to be rebuilt, and entered Byzantine [[Cappadocia]] through the [[Cilician Gates]]. Harun marched to [[Tyana]], which at the time seems to have been abandoned. There, he began to establish his base of operations, ordering [[Uqbah ibn Ja'far al-Khuza'i]] to refortify the town and erect a [[mosque]].{{sfn|Treadgold|1988|pp=144\u2013145}}{{sfn|Bosworth|1989|pp=262\u2013263}}{{sfn|Kiapidou|2002|loc=\u00a7 2.

The city was plundered and razed, and its inhabitants enslaved and deported to the Caliphate.{{sfn|Bosworth|1989|p=262}}{{sfn|Mango|Scott|1997|p=661}} The fall of Herakleia was considered by the Arab chroniclers the most significant achievement of Harun's expeditions against the Byzantines,{{sfn|Canard|1962|p=356}} and is the central event in the narratives of Harun's retaliatory campaign against Nikephoros. As the historian [[Marius Canard]] remarks, \"for the Arabs the capture of Herakleia had an impact as profound as the [[Sack of Amorium]] in 838\", which is completely at odds with the city's actual importance. Indeed, the Byzantine sources do not place any particular emphasis on the fall of Herakleia compared to the other fortresses captured during Harun's 806 campaign.{{efn|name=fn2|There is at least some indication in the Arab sources that a different course was suggested to the Caliph: Harun is said to have asked two leaders from the frontier region on whether he should attack Herakleia. The first replied that it was the strongest fortress, and that if it fell, no-one would be able to oppose them, but the second replied that the city would yield little booty, and that he should attack a more important city. However, during the course of the siege he is said to have changed his mind and encouraged Harun to persist with the siege, when the Caliph was thinking of abandoning it.{{sfn|Canard|1962|p=364}}}}{{sfn|Canard|1962|p=378}}\n\nAt the same time, on Cyprus, Humayd ravaged the island and took some 16,000 Cypriots, including the [[Archbishop of Cyprus|local archbishop]], captive to Syria, where they were sold as slaves.{{sfn|Bosworth|1989|p=262}}{{sfn|Mango|Scott|1997|p=662}}{{sfn|Treadgold|1988|p=145}}\n\nNikephoros, outnumbered and threatened by the [[First Bulgarian Empire|Bulgars]] in his rear, could not resist the Abbasid onslaught. He campaigned himself at the head of his army and seemingly won a few minor engagements against isolated detachments, but stayed well clear of the main Abbasid forces. In the end, with the harrowing possibility of the Arabs wintering on Byzantine soil in Tyana, he sent three [[cleric]]s as ambassadors: [[Michael of Synnada|Michael]], the bishop of [[Synnada]], [[Peter of Goulaion|Peter]], the abbot of the [[monastery]] of Goulaion, and Gregory, the steward of the metropolis of [[Amastris (city)|Amastris]]. Harun agreed to peace in exchange for the payment of an annual tribute (30,000 [[gold]] ''[[solidus (coin)|nomismata]]'', according to Theophanes, 50,000 according to al-Tabari), but the Emperor and his son and heir, [[Staurakios]], were to pay a humiliating personal poll-tax (''[[jizya]]'') of three gold coins each to the Caliph (four and two respectively, in Tabari's version), thereby acknowledging themselves as the Caliph's subjects. In addition, Nikephoros promised not to rebuild the dismantled forts. Harun then recalled his forces from their various sieges and evacuated Byzantine territory.{{sfn|Kiapidou|2002|loc=\u00a7 2.

According to al-Tabari,\n{{quote|[Harun] ordered the slave girl to be sought out; she was brought back, adorned with finery and installed on a seat in the tent in which he himself was lodging.

The larger summer raid under [[Harthama ibn A'yan]] was met by Nikephoros in person, and after an indecisive battle both sides retreated. The Byzantines raided the region of [[Marash]] in return, while in late summer Humayd launched a major naval raid, which pillaged [[Rhodes]] and reached as far as the [[Peloponnese]], where it may have fomented a [[Siege of Patras (805 or 807)|rebellion]] among the local [[Slavs]]. On his return, however, Humayd lost several ships to a storm, and on the Peloponnese, the Slavic revolt was put down after failing to capture the city of [[Patras]] during the siege of 805.{{sfn|Brooks|1923|p=127}}{{sfn|Treadgold|1988|pp=147\u2013148}}{{sfn|Bosworth|1989|pp=267\u2013268}} The failure of the year's Abbasid efforts were compounded by the outbreak of [[Rafi ibn al-Layth]]'s rebellion in Khurasan, which forced Harun to depart again for the East. The Caliph concluded a new truce, and another prisoner exchange was held at the Lamos in 808. Nikephoros was thus left with his gains, both the restored frontier fortifications and the cessation of tribute, intact.{{sfn|Treadgold|1988|p=155}}\n\n==Impact==\n[[File:Arabische Eroberung 2.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.25|alt=Multi-color map of the Mediterranean and the Middle East, showing the phases of Muslim expansion to the 10th century|Map of the [[spread of Islam]] during the 7th and 8th centuries and of the [[Muslim world]] under the [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad]] and early [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasid]] caliphates, from the {{Interlanguage link|Allgemeiner historischer Handatlas|de|lt=''Allgemeiner historischer Handatlas''}} of [[Johann Gustav Droysen]] (1886)]]\n\nHarun's massive expedition achieved remarkably little in material terms.

In general terms, they were content with the territorial limits achieved, and whatever external campaigns they waged were retaliatory or pre-emptive, meant to preserve their frontier and impress Abbasid might upon their neighbours.{{sfn|El-Hibri|2010|p=302}} At the same time, the campaigns against Byzantium in particular were important for domestic consumption. The annual raids were a symbol of the continuing ''[[jihad]]'' of the early Muslim state and were the only external expeditions where the Caliph or his sons participated in person. They were closely paralleled in official [[propaganda]] by the leadership by Abbasid family members of the annual pilgrimage (''[[hajj]]'') to [[Mecca]], highlighting the dynasty's leading role in the religious life of the Muslim community.{{sfn|El-Hibri|2010|pp=278\u2013279}}{{sfn|Kennedy|2001|pp=105\u2013106}} Harun al-Rashid in particular actively strove to embody this duty: he was said to have alternated between leading the ''hajj'' one year and attacking Byzantium the next.{{sfn|El-Cheikh|2004|pp=89\u201390}} The hitherto unseen extent of his personal involvement in the ''jihad'' converted it into a central tenet of his conception of the caliphate, leading modern historians to consider Harun as the creator of a new type of model ruler, the \"''ghazi''-caliph\".{{sfn|Bosworth|1989|p=xvii}}{{sfn|Bonner|1996|pp=99\u2013106}}{{sfn|Haug|2011|pp=637\u2013638}}}}{{sfn|Treadgold|1988|pp=144, 146}} In that regard, the Abbasid campaign was certainly a success: after 806, the Byzantine ruler abandoned whatever expansionist plans he may have had for the eastern border and focused his energy on his fiscal reforms, the recovery of the [[Balkans]], and his wars there against the Bulgars, which would end with his death in the disastrous [[Battle of Pliska]] in 811.{{sfn|Treadgold|1988|pp=168\u2013174}}{{sfn|Treadgold|1988|pp=146, 157\u2013174}}{{sfn|Kiapidou|2002|loc=\u00a7 3. Consequences}}\n\nOn the other hand, the historian [[M. A. Shaban]] considers the campaign a \"limited success\" at best, and criticizes Harun's \"single-minded\" attention to the Byzantines as a \"totally misguided effort\". According to Shaban, not only did the Byzantines have no real ability (or intention) to seriously threaten the Caliphate, but Harun's recruitment drive led to the influx of eastern soldiers from Khurasan, which antagonized the traditional Syrian\u2013Iraqi military elites and created rifts that contributed to the [[Fourth Fitna]], the Abbasid civil war that broke out after Harun's death.{{sfn|Shaban|1976|pp=32, 38\u201339}} This conflict, between Harun's sons [[al-Amin]] ({{reign|809|813}}) and [[al-Ma'mun]] ({{reign|813|833}}), meant that the Abbasid Caliphate was not able to exploit the Byzantine reversals in the Balkans. Indeed, the 806 campaign and the ineffectual raids of 807 mark the last major, centrally organized, Abbasid expeditions against Byzantium for over twenty years.{{sfn|Brooks|1923|p=127}}{{sfn|Treadgold|1988|p=157}} Isolated raids and counter-raids continued at land as well as at sea, and, independently of the Abbasids, local Muslim leaders [[Emirate of Crete|conquered Crete]] and launched the [[Muslim conquest of Sicily|conquest of Sicily]] in the 820s.{{sfn|Brooks|1923|pp=127\u2013128}}{{sfn|Treadgold|1988|pp=183, 219\u2013220, 248\u2013257}} Nevertheless, large-scale operations over the land border in eastern Anatolia between the two empires resumed only after the accession of Emperor [[Theophilos (emperor)|Theophilos]] ({{reign|829|842}}), whose confrontations with the caliphs al-Ma'mun and [[al-Mu'tasim]] ({{reign|833|842}}) culminated in the great invasions by al-Ma'mun in 830\u2013833, and the Sack of Amorium by al-Mu'tasim in 838.{{sfn|Brooks|1923|pp=128\u2013131}}{{sfn|Treadgold|1988|pp=272\u2013275, 278\u2013281, 292\u2013305}}\n\n[[File:Heraqla,SE.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.25|alt=Photo of a mound of ruins in a barren field|View of the remnants of ''Hiraqla'', a victory monument erected by Harun after the campaign of 806]]\nThe longest-lasting impact of Harun's campaign is found in literature. Among the Arabs, several legends or anecdotes, related by sources such as [[al-Masudi]] and the ''[[Kitab al-Aghani]]'', were associated with it, emphasizing the city's strong fortifications, describing a single combat between a Byzantine and an Arab champion which was decided when the Arab captured the Byzantine by using a [[lasso]], or the terror inspired among the defenders by the Abbasid army's use of large catapults throwing [[Greek fire]]-like substances.{{sfn|Canard|1962|pp=363\u2013372}} The [[Ottoman Turks]] also placed great importance on Harun's battles with the Byzantines. The account of the 17th-century Ottoman traveller [[Evliya \u00c7elebi]] mixes the events of Harun's 782 campaign, when the Arab army had reached the [[Bosporus]], with those of 806, as well as introducing clearly fictional elements such as the manner of Nikephoros' death. According to Evliya, Harun besieged Constantinople twice. The first time the Caliph withdrew, after securing as much land as an oxhide could cover and building a fortress there, in an imitation of the ancient tale of [[Dido|Queen Dido]]. The second time, Harun marched on Constantinople to avenge the massacre of Muslims living there, and ordered Nikephoros executed by hanging at the [[Hagia Sophia]].{{sfn|Canard|1926|pp=103\u2013104}}\n\nTo commemorate his successful campaign, Harun built a victory monument about {{convert|8|km|mi|sigfig=1}} west of Raqqa, his principal residence. Known as ''{{ill|Hiraqla|de|Heraqla}}'' in local tradition, apparently after Herakleia, it comprises a square structure with sides {{convert|100|m|ft}} long, surrounded by a circular wall about {{convert|500|m|ft}} in diameter, pierced by four gates in the cardinal directions. The main structure, built from stone taken from churches demolished on Harun's orders in 806\u2013807, has four vaulted halls on the ground floor, and ramps leading to an upper storey, which was left incomplete on Harun's departure for Khurasan and subsequent death.{{sfn|Meinecke|1995|p=412}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|20em}}\n\n==Sources==\n* {{The History of al-Tabari | volume = 30 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wqf1gwM9O58C}}\n* {{cite book | last = Bonner | first = Michael | title = Aristocratic Violence and Holy War: Studies in the Jihad and the Arab\u2013Byzantine Frontier | year = 1996 | publisher = American Oriental Society | location = New Haven, Connecticut | isbn = 0-940490-11-0  | ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book | last=Brooks | first=E.

The expedition took place in southeastern and central [[Asia Minor]], where the Abbasid and Byzantine empires shared a long land border.\n\nUpon coming to the throne, the [[Byzantine emperor]] [[Nikephoros I]] ({{reign|802|811}}) ceased paying the [[tribute]] agreed to by his predecessors with the Caliphate, and launched attacks on the Abbasid [[al-Awasim|frontier regions]]. The [[Abbasid caliph]], [[Harun al-Rashid]] ({{reign|786|809}}), who sought to promote himself as a champion of ''[[jihad]]'', decided to lead in person a retaliatory attack with the objective of punishing the Byzantines and impressing Abassid might upon their emperor.\n\nHarun assembled his army at [[Raqqa]] in northern Syria. Medieval historians record numbers to be as high as 135,000 or even 300,000 men. While these are clearly exaggerated, it is clear that the Abbasid force assembled for the invasion was far larger than anything seen before. The Abbasid army set out from Raqqa on 11 June 806, crossed the coastal region of [[Cilicia]] and the [[Taurus Mountains]], and invaded the Byzantine province of [[Cappadocia]]. The Abbasids met no opposition and raided at will, capturing several towns and fortresses. Celebrated in Arab histories was the siege, fall, and sack of the city of [[Heraclea Cybistra|Herakleia]]; its name was later given to a victory monument erected by the Caliph near Raqqa. The Byzantine losses forced Nikephoros to seek peace terms in which he offered a resumption of tribute payments in exchange for the Abbasids' withdrawal. However, this time Harun exacted an additional [[jizya|personal tax]] levied on the Emperor and his son and heir, [[Staurakios]], as a token of their submission to the Caliph.\n\nAlmost immediately following Harun's departure, Nikephoros violated the peace terms by refortifying the sacked frontier forts and stopping tribute payments. However, Harun's preoccupation with a rebellion in [[Greater Khorasan|Khurasan]], and his death three years later, prevented a reprisal on a similar scale to 806. Smaller-scale raids continued on both sides, but the [[Fourth Fitna|Abbasid civil war]], which began after 809, and the Byzantine preoccupation with the [[First Bulgarian Empire|Bulgars]] contributed to a cessation of large-scale [[Arab\u2013Byzantine wars|Arab\u2013Byzantine conflict]] for the next two decades.\n\n==Background==\nThe [[Deposition (politics)|deposition]] of Byzantine empress [[Irene of Athens]] in October 802 and the accession of [[Nikephoros I]] in her place marked the start of a more violent phase in the long history of the [[Arab\u2013Byzantine wars]]. Following a series of destructive annual raids into Byzantine [[Asia Minor]] by the [[Abbasid Caliphate]], Empress Irene apparently secured a truce with Caliph [[Harun al-Rashid]] in 798 in exchange for the annual payment of [[tribute]], repeating the terms agreed for a three-year truce after Harun's [[Abbasid invasion of Asia Minor (782)|first large-scale campaign]] into Asia Minor in 782.{{sfn|Brooks|1923|p=126}}{{sfn|Treadgold|1988|p=113}}{{sfn|Kiapidou|2002|loc=\u00a7 1.

In addition, the new emperor was determined to refill the treasury by, among other measures, ceasing the tribute.{{sfn|Treadgold|1988|pp=127, 130}}\n\n[[File:Solidus-Nicephorus I and Staraucius-sb1604.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.25|alt=Obverse and reverse of a medieval gold coin, showing the busts of a bearded crowned man and of a younger crowned man|Gold ''[[solidus (coin)|nomisma]]'' of Emperor [[Nikephoros I]] (left) and his son and heir, [[Staurakios]] (right)]]\nIn retaliation for the cessation of tribute and the violation of the peace agreement concluded with Irene, Harun launched a raid under his son [[al-Qasim ibn Harun al-Rashid|al-Qasim]] in spring 803.{{sfn|Bosworth|1989|pp=238\u2013239}}{{sfn|Treadgold|1988|p=131}} Nikephoros could not respond to this, as he faced a large-scale revolt of the Byzantine army of Asia Minor under its commander-in-chief, [[Bardanes Tourkos]].{{sfn|Treadgold|1988|pp=131\u2013133}} After disposing of Bardanes, Nikephoros assembled his army and marched out to meet a second, larger invasion under the Caliph in person. After Harun raided the frontier region, the two armies faced one another for two months in central Asia Minor, but it did not come to a battle: Nikephoros and Harun exchanged letters,{{efn|[[Al-Tabari]] and other Muslim sources record the texts, supposedly of Nikephoros' letter demanding the return of the tribute paid until then, and Harun's brief reply to Nikephoros, calling him \"the dog of the Byzantines\" (''kalb [[R\u00fbm|al-Rum]]''): \"O son of an infidel woman, I have read your letter, and the reply is what you will see, without you having to hear it.

Nikephoros set out to confront the Arabs, but was surprised and heavily defeated at the [[Battle of Krasos]], where he barely escaped with his life.{{sfn|Brooks|1923|p=126}}{{sfn|Kiapidou|2002|loc=\u00a7 1.

In the summer of the same year, he launched the first Byzantine raid in two decades against the Arab frontier districts or [[al-Awasim|''thugh\u016br'']] in Cilicia. The Byzantine army raided the territory surrounding the fortresses of [[Mopsuestia]] and [[Anazarbus]] and took prisoners as it went. The garrison of Mopsuestia attacked the Byzantine force and recovered most of the prisoners and spoils, but the Byzantines marched on to [[Tarsus (city)|Tarsus]], which had been refortified and repopulated on Harun's orders in 786 to strengthen the Muslim hold on Cilicia. The city fell and the entire garrison was taken captive.{{sfn|Brooks|1923|p=126}}{{sfn|Treadgold|1988|pp=135, 138\u2013139}}{{sfn|Bosworth|1989|pp=261\u2013262}}\n\nAt the same time, another Byzantine force raided the [[Upper Mesopotamia]]n ''thugh\u016br'' and unsuccessfully besieged the fortress of [[Melitene]], while a Byzantine-instigated rebellion against the local Arab garrison began in [[Cyprus]], which for over a century had been an Arab\u2013Byzantine [[condominium (international law)|condominium]].{{efn|In 688, Emperor [[Justinian II]] and the [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad caliph]] [[Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan]] concluded an agreement whereby Cyprus became a neutral territory, its tax revenue shared between Byzantium and the Caliphate, and its ports open to both powers, including for military purposes against one another. Apart from a brief Byzantine reoccupation under [[Basil I]], this status lasted until 965, when the island was reincorporated into the Byzantine Empire.{{sfn|ODB|loc=\"Cyprus\" (T. E. Gregory), pp. 567\u2013569}}}}{{sfn|Treadgold|1988|pp=135, 138\u2013139}}\n\nThis sudden resumption of Byzantine offensive activity greatly alarmed Harun, especially as he received reports that Nikephoros was planning similar attacks for the next year, which this time would aim at the full reoccupation of these frontier territories. As the historian [[Warren Treadgold]] writes, if the Byzantines had been successful in this endeavour, \"garrisoning Tarsus and Melitene would have partly blocked the main Arab invasion routes across the Taurus into the Byzantine heartland, to the Byzantines' great benefit\". On the other hand, Nikephoros was certainly aware of the huge superiority of the Caliphate in men and resources, and it is more likely that he intended this campaign simply as a show of strength and a test of his enemy's resolve.{{sfn|Treadgold|1988|p=139}}\n\n==Campaign==\nHaving settled matters in Khurasan by confirming Ibn Mahan in his governorship,{{sfn|Bosworth|1989|pp=253\u2013254}} Harun returned to the west in November 805 and prepared a huge retaliatory expedition for 806, drawing men from [[Bilad al-Sham|Syria]], [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], [[Medieval Persia|Persia]], and [[Medieval Egypt|Egypt]]. According to [[al-Tabari]], his army numbered 135,000 regular troops and additional volunteers and [[Filibuster (military)|freebooters]].{{sfn|Bosworth|1989|p=262}}{{sfn|Kennedy|2001|pp=99, 106}} These numbers are easily the largest ever recorded for the entire Abbasid era,{{sfn|Kennedy|2001|pp=99, 106}} and about half as many as the estimated strength of the entire [[Byzantine army]].{{sfn|Treadgold|1988|p=144}} Although they\u2014and the even more fantastic claims of the Byzantine chronicler [[Theophanes the Confessor]] of 300,000 men\u2014are certainly exaggerated, they are nevertheless indicative of the size of the Abbasid force.{{sfn|Kennedy|2001|pp=99, 106}}{{sfn|Mango|Scott|1997|pp=661, 662 (note 5)}}  At the same time, a naval force under his admiral [[Humayd ibn Ma'yuf al-Hajuri]] was prepared to raid Cyprus.{{sfn|Bosworth|1989|p=262}}{{sfn|Treadgold|1988|p=144}}\n\n[[File:Arab-Byzantine frontier zone.svg|thumb|right|upright=1.25|alt=Geophysical map of eastern Anatolia and northern Syria, showing the main fortresses during the Arab\u2013Byzantine frontier wars|Map of the Byzantine\u2013Arab frontier zone in southeastern [[Asia Minor]], where the Abbasid campaign of 806 took place]]\nThe huge invasion army departed Harun's residence of [[Raqqa]] in northern Syria on 11 June 806, with the Caliph at its head. Al-Tabari reports that Harun put on a cap with the inscription \"Warrior for the Faith and Pilgrim\" (in Arabic, \"''[[Ghazi (warrior)|ghazi]]'', ''[[hajj]]''\"). The Abbasids crossed Cilicia, where Harun ordered Tarsus to be rebuilt, and entered Byzantine [[Cappadocia]] through the [[Cilician Gates]]. Harun marched to [[Tyana]], which at the time seems to have been abandoned. There, he began to establish his base of operations, ordering [[Uqbah ibn Ja'far al-Khuza'i]] to refortify the town and erect a [[mosque]].{{sfn|Treadgold|1988|pp=144\u2013145}}{{sfn|Bosworth|1989|pp=262\u2013263}}{{sfn|Kiapidou|2002|loc=\u00a7 2.

The city was plundered and razed, and its inhabitants enslaved and deported to the Caliphate.{{sfn|Bosworth|1989|p=262}}{{sfn|Mango|Scott|1997|p=661}} The fall of Herakleia was considered by the Arab chroniclers the most significant achievement of Harun's expeditions against the Byzantines,{{sfn|Canard|1962|p=356}} and is the central event in the narratives of Harun's retaliatory campaign against Nikephoros. As the historian [[Marius Canard]] remarks, \"for the Arabs the capture of Herakleia had an impact as profound as the [[Sack of Amorium]] in 838\", which is completely at odds with the city's actual importance. Indeed, the Byzantine sources do not place any particular emphasis on the fall of Herakleia compared to the other fortresses captured during Harun's 806 campaign.{{efn|name=fn2|There is at least some indication in the Arab sources that a different course was suggested to the Caliph: Harun is said to have asked two leaders from the frontier region on whether he should attack Herakleia. The first replied that it was the strongest fortress, and that if it fell, no-one would be able to oppose them, but the second replied that the city would yield little booty, and that he should attack a more important city. However, during the course of the siege he is said to have changed his mind and encouraged Harun to persist with the siege, when the Caliph was thinking of abandoning it.{{sfn|Canard|1962|p=364}}}}{{sfn|Canard|1962|p=378}}\n\nAt the same time, on Cyprus, Humayd ravaged the island and took some 16,000 Cypriots, including the [[Archbishop of Cyprus|local archbishop]], captive to Syria, where they were sold as slaves.{{sfn|Bosworth|1989|p=262}}{{sfn|Mango|Scott|1997|p=662}}{{sfn|Treadgold|1988|p=145}}\n\nNikephoros, outnumbered and threatened by the [[First Bulgarian Empire|Bulgars]] in his rear, could not resist the Abbasid onslaught. He campaigned himself at the head of his army and seemingly won a few minor engagements against isolated detachments, but stayed well clear of the main Abbasid forces. In the end, with the harrowing possibility of the Arabs wintering on Byzantine soil in Tyana, he sent three [[cleric]]s as ambassadors: [[Michael of Synnada|Michael]], the bishop of [[Synnada]], [[Peter of Goulaion|Peter]], the abbot of the [[monastery]] of Goulaion, and Gregory, the steward of the metropolis of [[Amastris (city)|Amastris]]. Harun agreed to peace in exchange for the payment of an annual tribute (30,000 [[gold]] ''[[solidus (coin)|nomismata]]'', according to Theophanes, 50,000 according to al-Tabari), but the Emperor and his son and heir, [[Staurakios]], were to pay a humiliating personal poll-tax (''[[jizya]]'') of three gold coins each to the Caliph (four and two respectively, in Tabari's version), thereby acknowledging themselves as the Caliph's subjects. In addition, Nikephoros promised not to rebuild the dismantled forts. Harun then recalled his forces from their various sieges and evacuated Byzantine territory.{{sfn|Kiapidou|2002|loc=\u00a7 2.

According to al-Tabari,\n{{quote|[Harun] ordered the slave girl to be sought out; she was brought back, adorned with finery and installed on a seat in the tent in which he himself was lodging. The slave girl and the tent, together with its contents, vessels and fittings, were handed over to Nikephoros's envoy. He also sent to Nikephoros the perfume which he had requested, and he further sent to him dates, dishes of jellied sweets, raisins and healing drugs.\"{{sfn|Bosworth|1989|p=264}}}}\n\nNikephoros returned the favour by dispatching a horse laden with 50,000 silver coins, 100 [[satin]] garments, 200 garments of fine [[brocade]], 12 [[falcon]]s, four hunting dogs, and three more horses.{{sfn|Bosworth|1989|p=264}}{{sfn|Treadgold|1988|p=146}} But as soon as the Arabs had withdrawn, the Emperor again restored the frontier forts and thereafter ceased the payment of tribute.

The larger summer raid under [[Harthama ibn A'yan]] was met by Nikephoros in person, and after an indecisive battle both sides retreated. The Byzantines raided the region of [[Marash]] in return, while in late summer Humayd launched a major naval raid, which pillaged [[Rhodes]] and reached as far as the [[Peloponnese]], where it may have fomented a [[Siege of Patras (805 or 807)|rebellion]] among the local [[Slavs]]. On his return, however, Humayd lost several ships to a storm, and on the Peloponnese, the Slavic revolt was put down after failing to capture the city of [[Patras]] during the siege of 805.{{sfn|Brooks|1923|p=127}}{{sfn|Treadgold|1988|pp=147\u2013148}}{{sfn|Bosworth|1989|pp=267\u2013268}} The failure of the year's Abbasid efforts were compounded by the outbreak of [[Rafi ibn al-Layth]]'s rebellion in Khurasan, which forced Harun to depart again for the East. The Caliph concluded a new truce, and another prisoner exchange was held at the Lamos in 808. Nikephoros was thus left with his gains, both the restored frontier fortifications and the cessation of tribute, intact.{{sfn|Treadgold|1988|p=155}}\n\n==Impact==\n[[File:Arabische Eroberung 2.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.25|alt=Multi-color map of the Mediterranean and the Middle East, showing the phases of Muslim expansion to the 10th century|Map of the [[spread of Islam]] during the 7th and 8th centuries and of the [[Muslim world]] under the [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad]] and early [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasid]] caliphates, from the {{Interlanguage link|Allgemeiner historischer Handatlas|de|lt=''Allgemeiner historischer Handatlas''}} of [[Johann Gustav Droysen]] (1886)]]\n\nHarun's massive expedition achieved remarkably little in material terms.

The annual raids were a symbol of the continuing ''[[jihad]]'' of the early Muslim state and were the only external expeditions where the Caliph or his sons participated in person. They were closely paralleled in official [[propaganda]] by the leadership by Abbasid family members of the annual pilgrimage (''[[hajj]]'') to [[Mecca]], highlighting the dynasty's leading role in the religious life of the Muslim community.{{sfn|El-Hibri|2010|pp=278\u2013279}}{{sfn|Kennedy|2001|pp=105\u2013106}} Harun al-Rashid in particular actively strove to embody this duty: he was said to have alternated between leading the ''hajj'' one year and attacking Byzantium the next.{{sfn|El-Cheikh|2004|pp=89\u201390}} The hitherto unseen extent of his personal involvement in the ''jihad'' converted it into a central tenet of his conception of the caliphate, leading modern historians to consider Harun as the creator of a new type of model ruler, the \"''ghazi''-caliph\".{{sfn|Bosworth|1989|p=xvii}}{{sfn|Bonner|1996|pp=99\u2013106}}{{sfn|Haug|2011|pp=637\u2013638}}}}{{sfn|Treadgold|1988|pp=144, 146}} In that regard, the Abbasid campaign was certainly a success: after 806, the Byzantine ruler abandoned whatever expansionist plans he may have had for the eastern border and focused his energy on his fiscal reforms, the recovery of the [[Balkans]], and his wars there against the Bulgars, which would end with his death in the disastrous [[Battle of Pliska]] in 811.{{sfn|Treadgold|1988|pp=168\u2013174}}{{sfn|Treadgold|1988|pp=146, 157\u2013174}}{{sfn|Kiapidou|2002|loc=\u00a7 3.

Shaban]] considers the campaign a \"limited success\" at best, and criticizes Harun's \"single-minded\" attention to the Byzantines as a \"totally misguided effort\". According to Shaban, not only did the Byzantines have no real ability (or intention) to seriously threaten the Caliphate, but Harun's recruitment drive led to the influx of eastern soldiers from Khurasan, which antagonized the traditional Syrian\u2013Iraqi military elites and created rifts that contributed to the [[Fourth Fitna]], the Abbasid civil war that broke out after Harun's death.{{sfn|Shaban|1976|pp=32, 38\u201339}} This conflict, between Harun's sons [[al-Amin]] ({{reign|809|813}}) and [[al-Ma'mun]] ({{reign|813|833}}), meant that the Abbasid Caliphate was not able to exploit the Byzantine reversals in the Balkans. Indeed, the 806 campaign and the ineffectual raids of 807 mark the last major, centrally organized, Abbasid expeditions against Byzantium for over twenty years.{{sfn|Brooks|1923|p=127}}{{sfn|Treadgold|1988|p=157}} Isolated raids and counter-raids continued at land as well as at sea, and, independently of the Abbasids, local Muslim leaders [[Emirate of Crete|conquered Crete]] and launched the [[Muslim conquest of Sicily|conquest of Sicily]] in the 820s.{{sfn|Brooks|1923|pp=127\u2013128}}{{sfn|Treadgold|1988|pp=183, 219\u2013220, 248\u2013257}} Nevertheless, large-scale operations over the land border in eastern Anatolia between the two empires resumed only after the accession of Emperor [[Theophilos (emperor)|Theophilos]] ({{reign|829|842}}), whose confrontations with the caliphs al-Ma'mun and [[al-Mu'tasim]] ({{reign|833|842}}) culminated in the great invasions by al-Ma'mun in 830\u2013833, and the Sack of Amorium by al-Mu'tasim in 838.{{sfn|Brooks|1923|pp=128\u2013131}}{{sfn|Treadgold|1988|pp=272\u2013275, 278\u2013281, 292\u2013305}}\n\n[[File:Heraqla,SE.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.25|alt=Photo of a mound of ruins in a barren field|View of the remnants of ''Hiraqla'', a victory monument erected by Harun after the campaign of 806]]\nThe longest-lasting impact of Harun's campaign is found in literature. Among the Arabs, several legends or anecdotes, related by sources such as [[al-Masudi]] and the ''[[Kitab al-Aghani]]'', were associated with it, emphasizing the city's strong fortifications, describing a single combat between a Byzantine and an Arab champion which was decided when the Arab captured the Byzantine by using a [[lasso]], or the terror inspired among the defenders by the Abbasid army's use of large catapults throwing [[Greek fire]]-like substances.{{sfn|Canard|1962|pp=363\u2013372}} The [[Ottoman Turks]] also placed great importance on Harun's battles with the Byzantines. The account of the 17th-century Ottoman traveller [[Evliya \u00c7elebi]] mixes the events of Harun's 782 campaign, when the Arab army had reached the [[Bosporus]], with those of 806, as well as introducing clearly fictional elements such as the manner of Nikephoros' death. According to Evliya, Harun besieged Constantinople twice. The first time the Caliph withdrew, after securing as much land as an oxhide could cover and building a fortress there, in an imitation of the ancient tale of [[Dido|Queen Dido]]. The second time, Harun marched on Constantinople to avenge the massacre of Muslims living there, and ordered Nikephoros executed by hanging at the [[Hagia Sophia]].{{sfn|Canard|1926|pp=103\u2013104}}\n\nTo commemorate his successful campaign, Harun built a victory monument about {{convert|8|km|mi|sigfig=1}} west of Raqqa, his principal residence. Known as ''{{ill|Hiraqla|de|Heraqla}}'' in local tradition, apparently after Herakleia, it comprises a square structure with sides {{convert|100|m|ft}} long, surrounded by a circular wall about {{convert|500|m|ft}} in diameter, pierced by four gates in the cardinal directions. The main structure, built from stone taken from churches demolished on Harun's orders in 806\u2013807, has four vaulted halls on the ground floor, and ramps leading to an upper storey, which was left incomplete on Harun's departure for Khurasan and subsequent death.{{sfn|Meinecke|1995|p=412}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|20em}}\n\n==Sources==\n* {{The History of al-Tabari | volume = 30 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wqf1gwM9O58C}}\n* {{cite book | last = Bonner | first = Michael | title = Aristocratic Violence and Holy War: Studies in the Jihad and the Arab\u2013Byzantine Frontier | year = 1996 | publisher = American Oriental Society | location = New Haven, Connecticut | isbn = 0-940490-11-0  | ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book | last=Brooks | first=E.

In response to pathogenic tissue damage, ILCs contribute to immunity via the secretion of [[Cytokine|signalling molecules]], and the regulation of both innate and adaptive immune cells. Characteristics allowing their differentiation from other immune cells include the absence of regular [[Lymphocyte|lymphoid morphology]], rearranged antigen receptors found on [[T cell receptor|T cells]] and [[B cell receptor|B cells]] (due to the lack of the [[recombination-activating gene| RAG]] gene), and phenotypic markers usually present on [[Myelocyte|myeloid]] or [[dendritic cell]]s. <ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Spits | first1 = Hergen | last2 = Cupedo | first2 = Tom | year = 2012 | title = Innate lymphoid cells: emerging insights in development, lineage relationships, and function | url = | journal = Annual Review of Immunology | volume = 30 | issue = | pages = 647\u2013675 | doi=10.1146/annurev-immunol-020711-075053 | pmid=22224763}}</ref> ILCs are primarily tissue resident cells, found in both [[Lymphatic system|lymphoid]] (immune associated), and non- lymphoid tissues, and rarely in the peripheral blood.

Disturbance of the epithelium lining the hepatic [[bile duct]]s is frequently observed in response to chronic liver inflammation, and increased proliferation of these ducts is associated with liver cancer.<ref name=\"OchelTiegs2019\"/> Evidence suggests that the enhanced proliferation is triggered by IL-13, which is produced by IL-33 induced production of ILC2 cells.

Alternatively, targeting their upstream activating mediators (IL-23, IL-1B, or IL-6), or their survival factors (IL-7) could be used as an approach to treat inflammatory diseases. <ref name=\"PantaziPowell2019\"/>\n\n=== ILCs in allergic rhinitis ===\n\n[[File:ILCs in allergic rhinitis 7 PNG.png|thumb|200px|The ILCs present in the nasal polyps of patients with allergic rhinitis, forming a positive feedback loop, promoting inflammation, therefore contributing to the pathophysiology of the disease.<ref name=\"EbboCrinier2017\"/>]]\n\nThe frequency of ILC2s has also been found to be elevated in other tissues with allergic symptoms, such as the [[nasal polyp]]s of patients with chronic [[sinusitis|rhinosinusitis]], and in patients with [[aspirin exacerbated respiratory disease]].<ref name=\"PandaColonna2019\"/> The concentration of ILC2s positively correlates with severity of the diseases. \n\nILC2s are activated due to presence of TSLP and IL-4, produced by epithelial cells and eosinophils respectively.

Disturbance of the epithelium lining the hepatic [[bile duct]]s is frequently observed in response to chronic liver inflammation, and increased proliferation of these ducts is associated with liver cancer.<ref name=\"OchelTiegs2019\"/> Evidence suggests that the enhanced proliferation is triggered by IL-13, which is produced by IL-33 induced production of ILC2 cells.

Therefore, inflammation associated with obesity can influence the progression of liver disease, due to the development of insulin resistance and metabolic dysregulation.<ref name=\"LuciVieira2019\"/> ILC1s as a key regulatory of adipose tissue inflammation, is therefore a potential therapeutic target for treating people with liver disease or [[metabolic syndrome]]. \n\nILC2s have also been identified in human and mouse [[white adipose tissue]], contributing to the development of obesity. Decreased responses of ILC2s in the tissue are a characteristic of obesity, as this interrupts their crucial role in energy homeostasis, resulting in reduced energy expenditure and increased adiposity.<ref name=\":1\"/>\n\n=== ILCs in skin inflammation ===\n\nThe frequency of ILC2s is higher in the inflamed skin of patients with [[atopic dermatitis]] than in healthy patients.<ref name=\"EbboCrinier2017\"/> The ILC2s from the skin of the patients had upregulation of the IL-25, IL-33, TSLP and PGD2 receptors, suggesting their role in the activation of ILC2s.

It was completed in the late 1970s and published in five volumes in the early 1980s. An index of the five volumes was published as a sixth volume in 1991. The dictionary is an expansion and consolidation of earlier etymological publications by Corominas, particularly the mid-1950s ''[[Diccionario cr\u00edtico etimol\u00f3gico de la lengua castellana]]''.<ref>\"Joan Coromines Philological Opus\", by Josep Ferrer I Costa '''in''' [http://www.fundaciocoromines.cat/wp-content/arxius/2007/09/centenary-coromines-english-2006.pdf ''Centenary Joan Coromines''] (8 megabytes), year 2006, page 31 (publisher: [http://www.fundaciocoromines.cat/joan-coromines/obra/ Fundaci\u00f3 Pere Coromines]).</ref>\n\n==Content==\nThis work has been called simply \"the best etymological dictionary of Spanish.\"<ref>Haensch and Ome\u00f1aca (2004:143)</ref><ref>Juan Pedro Qui\u00f1onero, \"[http://unatemporadaenelinfierno.blogspot.com/2005/09/espaol-palabra-extranjera.html Espa\u00f1ol, palabra extranjera]\" (13 September 2005)</ref> Throughout more than six thousand pages, Corominas establishes the origin and development of Castilian vocabulary, both archaic and modern, Peninsular and Latin American, often referencing other Iberian and Romance languages.\n\nThe adjective \"Hispanic\" in the title is used in a broad sense, recognizing that the historical study of the Spanish language must take into account its interactions with other languages. Thus, [[Galician language|Galician]], [[Galician-Portuguese]], [[Leonese language|Leonese]], [[Asturian language|Asturian]], [[Aragonese language|Aragonese]], [[Catalan language|Catalan]], and the now-extinct [[Mozarabic language|Mozarabic]] are mentioned in the context of their lexical influence on Spanish.\n\nThe dictionary includes not only the core vocabulary of Latin- and Romance-derived words, but also words of non-Romance origin, notably [[Basque language|Basque]], [[Arabic language|Arabic]], and [[languages of the Americas]].\n\nAn essential aspect of the dictionary is its critical character.
