('''MLSE''') is a [[professional sports]] and [[commercial real estate]] company based in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]], Canada. With assets that include franchises in four of the six [[major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada]], it is the largest sports and entertainment company in Canada, and one of the largest in [[North America]].<ref>{{citeweb|url=https://www.cbc.ca/sports/hockey/nhl/rogers-bell-buy-control-of-mlse-1.997655|title=Rogers, Bell buy control of MLSE|date=2011-12-09|accessdate=2020-04-04|publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]]}}</ref>\n\nThe primary holdings of the company are its major sports franchises, the [[Toronto Maple Leafs]] of the [[National Hockey League]], [[Toronto Raptors]] of the [[National Basketball Association]], [[Toronto Argonauts]] of the [[Canadian Football League]], and [[Toronto FC]] of [[Major League Soccer]], as well as their minor league [[farm team]]s, the [[Toronto Marlies]] of the [[American Hockey League]] (AHL), [[Raptors 905]] of the [[NBA G League]] and [[Toronto FC II]] of the [[USL League One]], respectively.\n\nIn addition, it owns [[Scotiabank Arena]] (originally named Air Canada Centre), the home arena of the Maple Leafs and Raptors, and the [[OVO Athletic Centre]] (originally named BioSteel Centre), the practice facility for the Raptors. MLSE also manages or has invested in several other sports facilities including [[BMO Field]], home of Toronto FC and the Toronto Argonauts; [[Coca-Cola Coliseum]], home of the Marlies; [[Ford Performance Centre]], the practice facility of the Maple Leafs and Marlies; [[BMO Training Ground]] practice facility for Toronto FC and home of Toronto FC II and the [[TFC Academy]]; and [[Lamport Stadium]], practice facility for the Argonauts.\n\nMLSE was founded by [[Conn Smythe]] in 1931 as '''Maple Leaf Gardens Limited (MLGL)''' to act as a [[holding company]] for the Maple Leafs and their planned new arena [[Maple Leaf Gardens]], from which the company got its name. Smythe transferred his ownership of the Leafs to the company in exchange for shares in MLGL and sold shares in the holding company to the public to help fund construction of the arena. While initially primarily a hockey company, with ownership stakes in a number of [[professional ice hockey|minor]] and [[junior hockey]] clubs including the [[Toronto Marlboros]] of the [[Ontario Hockey Association]], the company later branched out to own the [[Hamilton Tiger-Cats]] of the CFL from the late 1970s to late 1980s, before merging with the Raptors, who were constructing the Air Canada Centre at the time, and adopting their current name in 1998. The company launched Toronto FC in 2007. Most recently, the company completed its purchase of the Argonauts in January 2018.<ref name=ArgosApprove>{{citeweb|url=https://www.argonauts.ca/2018/01/19/mlse-acquisition-toronto-argonauts-approved-cfl-board-governors/|title=MLSE ACQUISITION OF TORONTO ARGONAUTS APPROVED BY CFL BOARD OF GOVERNORS|date=January 19, 2018|accessdate=January 19, 2018|publisher=[[Toronto Argonauts]]}}</ref>\n\nOver most of its 80 plus years of existence MLSE was a [[public company]]. Following the death of majority owner [[Harold Ballard]] in 1990, [[Steve Stavro]] led a controversial bid to buy the company and take it [[Privately held company|private]]. In 2012, the [[Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan]] sold their 79.53% share of the company for {{CAD|1.32}} billion to a joint venture between [[Rogers Communications]] and [[BCE Inc.]], two of Canada's largest media companies, giving the company an equity value of {{CAD|1.66}} billion and an enterprise value of {{CAD|2}} billion.\n\n==Corporate history==\n{{see also|History of the Toronto Maple Leafs}}\n\n===Founding===\n[[File:Maple Leaf Gardens' roof under construction, 1931 (public domain).png|thumb|left|300px|Maple Leaf Gardens roof under construction, pictured in 1931]]\nThe corporation's roots can be traced back to 1927, when [[Conn Smythe]] organized a group of investors to purchase Toronto's premier hockey franchise, the [[Toronto St. Patricks]] of the [[National Hockey League]] (NHL), which had won [[Stanley Cup]] championships in [[1917\u201318 NHL season|1918]] (as the [[Toronto Arenas]]) and [[1921\u201322 NHL season|1922]], from a group headed by [[Charles Querrie]]. The club was playing poorly and minority partner [[Jack Bickell]] contacted Smythe about becoming coach of the team.  However, Smythe told Bickell that he was more interested in buying a stake in the team. Not long after, with the team in trouble financially due to majority owner Querrie having lost a lawsuit to former [[Toronto Blueshirts]] owner [[Eddie Livingstone]] over ownership of the franchise, Querrie put the St. Pats up for sale and agreed in principle to sell them to [[C.

MLGL from its founding in 1931, he did not acquire majority ownership of the company until 1947, following a power struggle between directors who supported him as president and those who wanted him replaced with [[Frank J. Selke]]. With the help of a $300,000 loan from Toronto stockbroker and MLGL shareholder Percy Gardiner, and the support of minority partner Jack Bickell, Smythe was able to buy 30,000 shares in MLGL from Gardiner<ref name=powerplay>{{cite news|title=Gardens power plays|date=April 3, 1995|newspaper=The Globe and Mail}}</ref> and installed himself as president on November 19, 1947, replacing Edward Bickle.<ref>{{cite news |title=Baseball's bankroll gone |last=Dunnell|first=Milt|authorlink=Milt Dunnell|newspaper=Toronto Star|date=July 5, 1965}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Hunter |first=Douglas |year=1997 |title=Champions: The Illustrated History of Hockey's Greatest Dynasties. |location=Chicago, Illinois |publisher=Triumph Books |isbn=1-57243-213-6 |page=50}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Smythe is elected Gardens' president|date=November 20, 1947|newspaper=[[Toronto Daily Star]]}}</ref>  The loan was paid off in 1960.<ref>{{cite book |title=Centre Ice: The Smythe Family, the Gardens, and the Toronto Maple Leafs Hockey Club |last1=Smythe |first1=Thomas Stafford |last2=Shea |first2=Kevin Shea |publisher=Fenn Publishing Co. |year=2000 |location=Bolton, Ontario, Canada |isbn=1-55168-250-8 |ref=harv|pages=156\u2013167}}</ref>  In November 1961, Smythe sold 45,000 of his 50,000 shares to a three-person partnership formed by his son [[Stafford Smythe]], [[Harold Ballard]], and John Bassett (owner of the ''[[Toronto Telegram]]'' and part-owner of the Canadian Football League's Toronto Argonauts) for $2.3 million.

He had hoped that Stafford would keep MLGL for his son, Tommy.<ref name=smytheyoung/>{{rp|217\u2013218}} However, it is unlikely that Stafford could have raised the millions needed for the deal on his own. Stafford became president of MLGL and governor of the Maple Leafs, with Ballard becoming executive vice president and Bassett chairman of the board.<ref name=powerplay/>\n\n===Harold Ballard, John Bassett, and Stafford Smythe===\nIn March 1966, Conn sold his remaining MLGL shares and resigned from the board of directors after a [[Muhammad Ali]] boxing match was scheduled for MLG. He found Ali's refusal to serve in the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] during the [[Vietnam War]] to be offensive,<ref name=smytheyoung/>{{rp|232}} and said that by accepting the fight, MLGL owners had \"put cash ahead of class.\"<ref>{{cite news |title='Cash rated over class' Conn quits |author=McKee, Ken |work=Toronto Star |date=March 8, 1966}}</ref>  Within three years under the new owners, profits had tripled to just under $1 million.

Just before the charges were laid, Bassett argued to the board of directors that Stafford and Ballard should be removed from their posts. On June 26, 1969, following an 8\u20137 vote of the board, Stafford and Ballard were both fired, and Bassett was appointed president of MLGL. However, Bassett did not force Stafford and Ballard to sell their shares, and both men remained on the board.  This proved to be a serious strategic blunder; Stafford was the largest single shareholder in MLGL, and he and Ballard controlled almost half the company's stock between them.  They were thus able to regain control of the board in 1970, and Stafford was once again appointed president.<ref name=powerplay/>  Facing an untenable situation, Bassett sold the 196,200 MLGL shares he controlled to Stafford and Ballard in September 1971 for $5.4 million, which he used to buy out his partners in the Argonauts.<ref name=death/><ref name=bassettsells>{{cite news|title=Bassett sells Gardens stock, buys control of Argos|first=Dick|last=Beddoes|authorlink=Dick Beddoes|date=September 2, 1971|newspaper=The Globe and Mail}}</ref><ref name=shakeup/> Combined with their 306,295 jointly controlled shares, the transaction gave the Stafford-Ballard partnership 78% of the stock.<ref name=bassettsells/><ref name=shakeup/>  Stafford died in October 1971 of a bleeding ulcer at only 50 years of age, just before his trial was scheduled to begin.<ref name=powerplay/><ref name=death/><ref name=repeats/> Under the terms of Stafford's will, of which Ballard was an [[executor]],<ref name=repeats>{{cite news|title=History repeats itself&nbsp;... almost|date=March 22, 1999|last=Tedesco|first=Theresa|newspaper=[[National Post]]}}</ref> each partner was allowed to buy the other's shares upon their death.

('''MLSE''') is a [[professional sports]] and [[commercial real estate]] company based in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]], Canada.

MLSE also manages or has invested in several other sports facilities including [[BMO Field]], home of Toronto FC and the Toronto Argonauts; [[Coca-Cola Coliseum]], home of the Marlies; [[Ford Performance Centre]], the practice facility of the Maple Leafs and Marlies; [[BMO Training Ground]] practice facility for Toronto FC and home of Toronto FC II and the [[TFC Academy]]; and [[Lamport Stadium]], practice facility for the Argonauts.\n\nMLSE was founded by [[Conn Smythe]] in 1931 as '''Maple Leaf Gardens Limited (MLGL)''' to act as a [[holding company]] for the Maple Leafs and their planned new arena [[Maple Leaf Gardens]], from which the company got its name. Smythe transferred his ownership of the Leafs to the company in exchange for shares in MLGL and sold shares in the holding company to the public to help fund construction of the arena. While initially primarily a hockey company, with ownership stakes in a number of [[professional ice hockey|minor]] and [[junior hockey]] clubs including the [[Toronto Marlboros]] of the [[Ontario Hockey Association]], the company later branched out to own the [[Hamilton Tiger-Cats]] of the CFL from the late 1970s to late 1980s, before merging with the Raptors, who were constructing the Air Canada Centre at the time, and adopting their current name in 1998. The company launched Toronto FC in 2007. Most recently, the company completed its purchase of the Argonauts in January 2018.<ref name=ArgosApprove>{{citeweb|url=https://www.argonauts.ca/2018/01/19/mlse-acquisition-toronto-argonauts-approved-cfl-board-governors/|title=MLSE ACQUISITION OF TORONTO ARGONAUTS APPROVED BY CFL BOARD OF GOVERNORS|date=January 19, 2018|accessdate=January 19, 2018|publisher=[[Toronto Argonauts]]}}</ref>\n\nOver most of its 80 plus years of existence MLSE was a [[public company]]. Following the death of majority owner [[Harold Ballard]] in 1990, [[Steve Stavro]] led a controversial bid to buy the company and take it [[Privately held company|private]]. In 2012, the [[Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan]] sold their 79.53% share of the company for {{CAD|1.32}} billion to a joint venture between [[Rogers Communications]] and [[BCE Inc.]], two of Canada's largest media companies, giving the company an equity value of {{CAD|1.66}} billion and an enterprise value of {{CAD|2}} billion.\n\n==Corporate history==\n{{see also|History of the Toronto Maple Leafs}}\n\n===Founding===\n[[File:Maple Leaf Gardens' roof under construction, 1931 (public domain).png|thumb|left|300px|Maple Leaf Gardens roof under construction, pictured in 1931]]\nThe corporation's roots can be traced back to 1927, when [[Conn Smythe]] organized a group of investors to purchase Toronto's premier hockey franchise, the [[Toronto St. Patricks]] of the [[National Hockey League]] (NHL), which had won [[Stanley Cup]] championships in [[1917\u201318 NHL season|1918]] (as the [[Toronto Arenas]]) and [[1921\u201322 NHL season|1922]], from a group headed by [[Charles Querrie]]. The club was playing poorly and minority partner [[Jack Bickell]] contacted Smythe about becoming coach of the team.  However, Smythe told Bickell that he was more interested in buying a stake in the team. Not long after, with the team in trouble financially due to majority owner Querrie having lost a lawsuit to former [[Toronto Blueshirts]] owner [[Eddie Livingstone]] over ownership of the franchise, Querrie put the St. Pats up for sale and agreed in principle to sell them to [[C. C.

MLGL from its founding in 1931, he did not acquire majority ownership of the company until 1947, following a power struggle between directors who supported him as president and those who wanted him replaced with [[Frank J. Selke]]. With the help of a $300,000 loan from Toronto stockbroker and MLGL shareholder Percy Gardiner, and the support of minority partner Jack Bickell, Smythe was able to buy 30,000 shares in MLGL from Gardiner<ref name=powerplay>{{cite news|title=Gardens power plays|date=April 3, 1995|newspaper=The Globe and Mail}}</ref> and installed himself as president on November 19, 1947, replacing Edward Bickle.<ref>{{cite news |title=Baseball's bankroll gone |last=Dunnell|first=Milt|authorlink=Milt Dunnell|newspaper=Toronto Star|date=July 5, 1965}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Hunter |first=Douglas |year=1997 |title=Champions: The Illustrated History of Hockey's Greatest Dynasties. |location=Chicago, Illinois |publisher=Triumph Books |isbn=1-57243-213-6 |page=50}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Smythe is elected Gardens' president|date=November 20, 1947|newspaper=[[Toronto Daily Star]]}}</ref>  The loan was paid off in 1960.<ref>{{cite book |title=Centre Ice: The Smythe Family, the Gardens, and the Toronto Maple Leafs Hockey Club |last1=Smythe |first1=Thomas Stafford |last2=Shea |first2=Kevin Shea |publisher=Fenn Publishing Co. |year=2000 |location=Bolton, Ontario, Canada |isbn=1-55168-250-8 |ref=harv|pages=156\u2013167}}</ref>  In November 1961, Smythe sold 45,000 of his 50,000 shares to a three-person partnership formed by his son [[Stafford Smythe]], [[Harold Ballard]], and John Bassett (owner of the ''[[Toronto Telegram]]'' and part-owner of the Canadian Football League's Toronto Argonauts) for $2.3 million.

Stafford became president of MLGL and governor of the Maple Leafs, with Ballard becoming executive vice president and Bassett chairman of the board.<ref name=powerplay/>\n\n===Harold Ballard, John Bassett, and Stafford Smythe===\nIn March 1966, Conn sold his remaining MLGL shares and resigned from the board of directors after a [[Muhammad Ali]] boxing match was scheduled for MLG. He found Ali's refusal to serve in the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] during the [[Vietnam War]] to be offensive,<ref name=smytheyoung/>{{rp|232}} and said that by accepting the fight, MLGL owners had \"put cash ahead of class.\"<ref>{{cite news |title='Cash rated over class' Conn quits |author=McKee, Ken |work=Toronto Star |date=March 8, 1966}}</ref>  Within three years under the new owners, profits had tripled to just under $1 million.

Just before the charges were laid, Bassett argued to the board of directors that Stafford and Ballard should be removed from their posts. On June 26, 1969, following an 8\u20137 vote of the board, Stafford and Ballard were both fired, and Bassett was appointed president of MLGL. However, Bassett did not force Stafford and Ballard to sell their shares, and both men remained on the board.  This proved to be a serious strategic blunder; Stafford was the largest single shareholder in MLGL, and he and Ballard controlled almost half the company's stock between them.  They were thus able to regain control of the board in 1970, and Stafford was once again appointed president.<ref name=powerplay/>  Facing an untenable situation, Bassett sold the 196,200 MLGL shares he controlled to Stafford and Ballard in September 1971 for $5.4 million, which he used to buy out his partners in the Argonauts.<ref name=death/><ref name=bassettsells>{{cite news|title=Bassett sells Gardens stock, buys control of Argos|first=Dick|last=Beddoes|authorlink=Dick Beddoes|date=September 2, 1971|newspaper=The Globe and Mail}}</ref><ref name=shakeup/> Combined with their 306,295 jointly controlled shares, the transaction gave the Stafford-Ballard partnership 78% of the stock.<ref name=bassettsells/><ref name=shakeup/>  Stafford died in October 1971 of a bleeding ulcer at only 50 years of age, just before his trial was scheduled to begin.<ref name=powerplay/><ref name=death/><ref name=repeats/> Under the terms of Stafford's will, of which Ballard was an [[executor]],<ref name=repeats>{{cite news|title=History repeats itself&nbsp;... almost|date=March 22, 1999|last=Tedesco|first=Theresa|newspaper=[[National Post]]}}</ref> each partner was allowed to buy the other's shares upon their death.

The city is commonly known as '''Korat''' ({{lang|th|\u0e42\u0e04\u0e23\u0e32\u0e0a}}, {{IPA-th|k\u02b0\u014d\u02d0.r\u00e2\u02d0t|pron}}), a shortened form of its name. It is the governmental seat of the [[Nakhon Ratchasima Province]] and [[Mueang Nakhon Ratchasima District]]. Nakhon Ratchasima is the heart of the Nakhon Ratchasima metropolitan area.\n\nKorat is at the western edge of the [[Korat Plateau]]. Historically, it once marked the boundary between [[Laos|Lao]] and [[Siam]]ese territory. It is the gateway to the Lao-speaking northeast ([[Isan]]). Its location is {{coord|14|58.5|N|102|6|E|type:city(150000)_region:TH-30|display=inline,title}}. {{Asof|2019}}, the municipal area had a population of 126,391.<ref name=\"TDD\"/>\n\n==Toponymy==\nArchaeological evidence suggests that in [[Amphoe Sung Noen|Sung Noen District]] 32&nbsp;km west of present-day Nakhon Ratchasima (Korat) there were two ancient towns called ''Sema'' (\"[[Bai sema]]\" ({{lang|th|\u0e43\u0e1a\u0e40\u0e2a\u0e21\u0e32}}) are notable artifacts of the [[Korat plateau]]){{cn|date=November 2019}} and ''Khorakapura''. ([[Pali]] ''p\u00fara'' becomes [[Sanskrit]] ''puri'', hence [[Thai language|Thai]] ({{lang|th-Latn|buri}}), all connoting the same as Thai ''[[mueang]]'': \"city with [[defensive wall]]\".) N The latter name was shortened to ''Nakhon Raj''. ({{lang|th-Latn|Nakhon}} ([[wikt:\u0e19\u0e04\u0e23|\u0e19\u0e04\u0e23]]) derives from [[Sanskrit]] ''nagara'' ({{lang|sa|\u0928\u0917\u0930}}), \"city\"; {{lang|th-Latn|Raj}} ([[wikt:\u0e23\u0e32\u0e0a|\u0e23\u0e32\u0e0a]]), from Sanskrit [[:wikt:raj|Raj]], \"[[wikt:sovereign|sovereign]].\") The present city name is a [[portmanteau]] of ''Nakhon Raj'' and ''Sema''.\n\nThe city is commonly known as \"Korat\" (Thai: \u0e42\u0e04\u0e23\u0e32\u0e0a), which is a short version of the ancient Khmer name \"ankor raj\".\n\n==History==\n[[File:Nakhonratchasima.JPG|250px|thumbnail|left|Ya Mo Entrance Gate at the junction of Ratchadamnoen Rd and Hwy 224]]\nPrior to the 14th century, the area of Nakhon Ratchasima was under [[Khmer empire]] [[suzerainty]] and known in [[Khmer language|Khmer]] as ''Angkor raj'', ''Nokor Reach Seyma'', or ''Nokor Reach Borei'', and ''Koreach''. [[Phimai]], to the north, was probably more important.\n\nKing [[Narai]] of [[Ayutthaya Kingdom|Ayutthaya]] in the 17th century, ordered a new city built on the site to serve as a [[fortification|stronghold]] on Ayutthaya's northeastern frontier. Nakhon Ratchasima was thereafter mentioned in Siamese chronicles and legal documents as a \"second-class\" city of the Ayutthaya Kingdom. A royal governor ruled the city in a hereditary position.\n\nAfter the [[Ayutthaya Kingdom#The final phase|final phase of the Ayutthaya kingdom]] ended with its [[Debellatio|complete destruction]] by the Burmese in 1767, a son of King [[Boromakot]] attempted to set himself up ruler in Phimai, holding sway over Korat and other eastern provinces. King [[Taksin]] of the [[Thonburi Kingdom]] (1768\u20131782) sent two of his generals, brothers [[Buddha Yodfa Chulaloke|Thong Duang]] and [[Maha Sura Singhanat|Boonma]], to defeat the prince, who was executed in 1768. Thong Duang later became King [[Rama (Kings of Thailand)|Rama]] I of the [[Rattanakosin Kingdom|kingdom]], and Korat became his strategic stronghold on the northeastern frontier to supervise the Lao and Khmer [[tributary state]]s.\n\n[[File:2019 0211 Nakhon Ratchasima train station.jpg|thumb|250px|Nakhon Ratchasima Railway Station]]\n\nIn 1826, [[Vientiane]] King [[wikt:\u0e40\u0e08\u0e49\u0e32|Chao]] [[Anouvong]], perceiving [[Rattanakosin Kingdom|Siam]] as weakened, attacked Korat in the [[Laotian Rebellion]] against King [[Rama III]] that was to rage on for two years.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Chandler |first1=David P.|last2=Roff |first2=William R.|last3=Smail |first3=John R.W.|last4=Steinberg |first4=David Joel|last5=Taylor |first5=Robert H. |last6=Woodside |first6=Alexander |last7=Wyatt |first7=David K. |editor1-first=Steinberg |editor1-last=David |title= In search of south-east Asia|edition= Revised|year= 1987|origyear= 1971|publisher= University of Hawaii Press|location= Honolulu |isbn= 0-8248-1110-0|oclc= 500095794|pages=113\u2013117 |chapter= 13 Siam, 1767\u20131868|lay-url= http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/11999252|laydate= January 8, 2008\n|lastauthoramp=y}}</ref> [[Thao Suranaree|Lady Mo]], the wife of the deputy governor at the time, is credited with having freed the city from Anouvong's army, and has been honored with a statue in the center of downtown Korat. A full account of the war and its impact on Laos and Siam, is detailed in the book, ''Lady Mo and Heroism at Tung Samrit'', written by Frank G Anderson. The city's old wall, east of the monument was designed and built by a French engineer who is believed to be the one who also built [[Narai]]maharaj Palace in [[Lopburi]]. The French-based design is reflected in the moat system that surrounds the innermost portion of the city.<!-- This needs sorting out. Narai was king from 1656 to 1688, so who was the Frenchman and what did he design? Maybe Korat's design was inspired by that of the palace? See this somewhat garbled account of the monument http://mrchevy.com/SuranareeMonument.htm -->\n\nNakhon Ratchasima continued to be an important political and economic center in the northeastern region under the [[Monthon]] administrative reforms of the late-19th century. In November 1900, the [[State Railway of Thailand|Royal State Railways of Siam]] began operation of the Nakhon Ratchasima Line from Bangkok with [[Nakhon Ratchasima Station|Korat Station]] as its [[Terminal train station#Terminus|terminus]]. The [[Ubon Ratchathani]] Line to the [[Amphoe Warin Chamrap|town of Warin]] opened 1 November 1922. The [[Thanon Chira Junction]] to [[Khon Kaen]] opened on 1 April 1933. ''Korat station'' was changed to [[Nakhon Ratchasima Railway Station]] in 1934.\n\nIn October 1933, after the [[Siamese revolution of 1932]] ended the [[absolute monarchy]], the city became the headquarters of the [[Boworadet Rebellion]], an abortive uprising against the new government in Bangkok.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nIn April 1981 during another [[Manoonkrit Roopkachorn#Attempted coup of 1981|attempted coup]], the government, together with the royal family, took refuge in Korat.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nFrom 1962 to 1976, during the [[Vietnam War]], [[Korat Royal Thai Air Force Base]] hosted components of the [[Royal Thai Air Force]], the [[United States Air Force]], and a complement of the [[Royal New Zealand Air Force]] (RNZAF). After the US withdrawal in 1976, the Thai Air Force assumed full control. During the 1980s and early-1990s, the airfield was jointly operated as a civil airport for Nakhon Ratchasima.

({{lang|th-Latn|Nakhon}} ([[wikt:\u0e19\u0e04\u0e23|\u0e19\u0e04\u0e23]]) derives from [[Sanskrit]] ''nagara'' ({{lang|sa|\u0928\u0917\u0930}}), \"city\"; {{lang|th-Latn|Raj}} ([[wikt:\u0e23\u0e32\u0e0a|\u0e23\u0e32\u0e0a]]), from Sanskrit [[:wikt:raj|Raj]], \"[[wikt:sovereign|sovereign]].\") The present city name is a [[portmanteau]] of ''Nakhon Raj'' and ''Sema''.\n\nThe city is commonly known as \"Korat\" (Thai: \u0e42\u0e04\u0e23\u0e32\u0e0a), which is a short version of the ancient Khmer name \"ankor raj\".\n\n==History==\n[[File:Nakhonratchasima.JPG|250px|thumbnail|left|Ya Mo Entrance Gate at the junction of Ratchadamnoen Rd and Hwy 224]]\nPrior to the 14th century, the area of Nakhon Ratchasima was under [[Khmer empire]] [[suzerainty]] and known in [[Khmer language|Khmer]] as ''Angkor raj'', ''Nokor Reach Seyma'', or ''Nokor Reach Borei'', and ''Koreach''. [[Phimai]], to the north, was probably more important.\n\nKing [[Narai]] of [[Ayutthaya Kingdom|Ayutthaya]] in the 17th century, ordered a new city built on the site to serve as a [[fortification|stronghold]] on Ayutthaya's northeastern frontier. Nakhon Ratchasima was thereafter mentioned in Siamese chronicles and legal documents as a \"second-class\" city of the Ayutthaya Kingdom. A royal governor ruled the city in a hereditary position.\n\nAfter the [[Ayutthaya Kingdom#The final phase|final phase of the Ayutthaya kingdom]] ended with its [[Debellatio|complete destruction]] by the Burmese in 1767, a son of King [[Boromakot]] attempted to set himself up ruler in Phimai, holding sway over Korat and other eastern provinces. King [[Taksin]] of the [[Thonburi Kingdom]] (1768\u20131782) sent two of his generals, brothers [[Buddha Yodfa Chulaloke|Thong Duang]] and [[Maha Sura Singhanat|Boonma]], to defeat the prince, who was executed in 1768. Thong Duang later became King [[Rama (Kings of Thailand)|Rama]] I of the [[Rattanakosin Kingdom|kingdom]], and Korat became his strategic stronghold on the northeastern frontier to supervise the Lao and Khmer [[tributary state]]s.\n\n[[File:2019 0211 Nakhon Ratchasima train station.jpg|thumb|250px|Nakhon Ratchasima Railway Station]]\n\nIn 1826, [[Vientiane]] King [[wikt:\u0e40\u0e08\u0e49\u0e32|Chao]] [[Anouvong]], perceiving [[Rattanakosin Kingdom|Siam]] as weakened, attacked Korat in the [[Laotian Rebellion]] against King [[Rama III]] that was to rage on for two years.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Chandler |first1=David P.|last2=Roff |first2=William R.|last3=Smail |first3=John R.W.|last4=Steinberg |first4=David Joel|last5=Taylor |first5=Robert H. |last6=Woodside |first6=Alexander |last7=Wyatt |first7=David K. |editor1-first=Steinberg |editor1-last=David |title= In search of south-east Asia|edition= Revised|year= 1987|origyear= 1971|publisher= University of Hawaii Press|location= Honolulu |isbn= 0-8248-1110-0|oclc= 500095794|pages=113\u2013117 |chapter= 13 Siam, 1767\u20131868|lay-url= http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/11999252|laydate= January 8, 2008\n|lastauthoramp=y}}</ref> [[Thao Suranaree|Lady Mo]], the wife of the deputy governor at the time, is credited with having freed the city from Anouvong's army, and has been honored with a statue in the center of downtown Korat. A full account of the war and its impact on Laos and Siam, is detailed in the book, ''Lady Mo and Heroism at Tung Samrit'', written by Frank G Anderson. The city's old wall, east of the monument was designed and built by a French engineer who is believed to be the one who also built [[Narai]]maharaj Palace in [[Lopburi]]. The French-based design is reflected in the moat system that surrounds the innermost portion of the city.<!-- This needs sorting out. Narai was king from 1656 to 1688, so who was the Frenchman and what did he design? Maybe Korat's design was inspired by that of the palace? See this somewhat garbled account of the monument http://mrchevy.com/SuranareeMonument.htm -->\n\nNakhon Ratchasima continued to be an important political and economic center in the northeastern region under the [[Monthon]] administrative reforms of the late-19th century. In November 1900, the [[State Railway of Thailand|Royal State Railways of Siam]] began operation of the Nakhon Ratchasima Line from Bangkok with [[Nakhon Ratchasima Station|Korat Station]] as its [[Terminal train station#Terminus|terminus]]. The [[Ubon Ratchathani]] Line to the [[Amphoe Warin Chamrap|town of Warin]] opened 1 November 1922. The [[Thanon Chira Junction]] to [[Khon Kaen]] opened on 1 April 1933. ''Korat station'' was changed to [[Nakhon Ratchasima Railway Station]] in 1934.\n\nIn October 1933, after the [[Siamese revolution of 1932]] ended the [[absolute monarchy]], the city became the headquarters of the [[Boworadet Rebellion]], an abortive uprising against the new government in Bangkok.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nIn April 1981 during another [[Manoonkrit Roopkachorn#Attempted coup of 1981|attempted coup]], the government, together with the royal family, took refuge in Korat.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nFrom 1962 to 1976, during the [[Vietnam War]], [[Korat Royal Thai Air Force Base]] hosted components of the [[Royal Thai Air Force]], the [[United States Air Force]], and a complement of the [[Royal New Zealand Air Force]] (RNZAF). After the US withdrawal in 1976, the Thai Air Force assumed full control. During the 1980s and early-1990s, the airfield was jointly operated as a civil airport for Nakhon Ratchasima.

Kosor was the [[List of elected or appointed female heads of government|first and so far only woman]] to become prime minister since independence.<ref>Skard, Torild (2014) \"Croatia's Milka Planinc and Jadranka Kosor\" in ''Women of power - half a century of female presidents and prime ministers worldwide'', Bristol: Policy Press, {{ISBN|978-1-44731-578-0}}, pp. 326-33</ref>\n\nKosor started working as a [[journalist]], following her graduation from [[Faculty of Law, University of Zagreb|Zagreb Faculty of Law]]. During the [[Croatian War of Independence]], she hosted a radio show dealing with [[refugee]] problems and disabled [[war veteran]]s. She joined the [[centre-right]] [[Croatian Democratic Union]] (HDZ) in 1989 and quickly climbed up the party hierarchy. In 1995 she was elected party vice-president and was elected to serve in [[Croatian Parliament|Parliament]] for the first time. After the death of [[President of Croatia|President]] and longtime HDZ leader [[Franjo Tu\u0111man]], Kosor supported Ivo Sanader's successful party leadership bid in 2000. Three years later, her party won the [[2003 Croatian parliamentary election|parliamentary election]] and Kosor became the [[Ministry of Veterans' Affairs (Croatia)|Minister of Family, Veterans' Affairs and Inter-generational Solidarity]] in the [[Cabinet of Ivo Sanader I|Sanader I]] and, later, [[Cabinet of Ivo Sanader II|Sanader II cabinet]], during which time she served as Deputy Prime Minister as well. In the [[2005 Croatian presidential election|2005 presidential election]] she ran as a representative of HDZ, but lost to incumbent President [[Stipe Mesi\u0107]] in the second round. After the abrupt resignation of Sanader, Kosor managed to form a functioning [[parliamentary majority]] and was approved to her new post as Prime Minister in July 2009, also becoming leader of her party. Kosor was the party's candidate for Prime Minister in the [[2011 Croatian parliamentary election|2011 general election]], but HDZ lost in a landslide over the [[centre-left]] [[Kukuriku coalition]], led by the [[Social Democratic Party of Croatia|Social Democratic Party]]. Kosor handed power to the new Prime Minister, [[Zoran Milanovi\u0107]], in December 2011.\n\nAs Prime Minister, Kosor failed to commit to structural reforms although she managed to prevent country's budgetary meltdown with two budget revisions and the introduction of new taxes as a response to the ongoing economic crisis. During her tenure, she strongly advocated a zero-tolerance policy to political corruption and organized crime. This uncompromising stance, along with the new [[criminal code]] passed before her term began, opened the door to unprecedented efforts to combat corruption. This resulted in numerous arrests of influential business-people and politicians from across the political spectrum, although most of them members of HDZ, which severely damaged the party's reputation. The discoveries made by prosecutors were far-reaching and criminal charges were even raised against former Prime Minister Ivo Sanader and Deputy Prime Minister [[Damir Polan\u010dec]], who would later be charged with lengthy prison sentences for criminal activity and abuse of power. In [[foreign policy]], Kosor and her [[Slovenia]]n counterpart [[Borut Pahor]] were successful in solving the long-standing border dispute and she is credited with successfully finishing the negotiating process of the [[Accession of Croatia to the European Union|Croatian accession]] to the [[European Union]]. On 9 December 2011, she and President [[Ivo Josipovi\u0107]] signed the [[Treaty of Accession 2011|EU Treaty of Accession]] in [[Brussels]]. A [[Moderate|moderate conservative]], Kosor ran for another term as party leader after losing the election, however, was defeated by the more [[conservative]] [[Tomislav Karamarko]]. After months of criticizing his leadership and the new party platform, she was expelled from HDZ by the party's High Court for damaging the party's reputation.\n\n==Early life==\n[[File:Kosor.jpg|150px|thumb|Jadranka Kosor at an EPP summit in 2009, wearing a [[brooch]], which is her well-known habit.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.jutarnji.hr/sto-jadranka-kosor-porucuje-brosem-u-obliku-leptira-/535548/ | newspaper = [[Jutarnji list]] | language = Croatian | title = \u0160to Jadranka Kosor poru\u010duje bro\u0161em u obliku leptira? | quote = Bro\u0161evi, koje u skladu sa situacijama i aktualnim prigodama na svojim reverima mijenja Jadranka Kosor, postali su ve\u0107 svojevrstan za\u0161titni znak hrvatske premijerke. | date = 2010-02-04 | accessdate = 2011-03-28}}</ref>]]\nJadranka Kosor was born in [[Lipik]] to Zorica Belan and Mirko Kosor.

One of the most unpopular austerity measures taken along with the introduction of the budget was a new income tax called the \"crisis tax\" ({{lang|hr|krizni porez}}).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.slobodnadalmacija.hr/novosti/hrvatska/clanak/id/65028/jadranka-kosor-krizni-porez-zahvatit-ce-sve|title=Jadranka Kosor: Krizni porez zahvatit \u0107e sve!|publisher=}}</ref> In addition, the [[value-added tax]] rate was increased from 22% to 23%.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.jutarnji.hr/vijesti/hrvatska/vlada-uvodi-krizni-porez-od-3-i-povecava-pdv-na-23/2825849/|title=Vlada uvodi krizni porez od 3% i pove\u0107ava PDV na 23%!|publisher=}}</ref> Businesses criticized the tax hikes as well as the idea of tax code changes in the middle of the fiscal year as an unreasonable burden, while independent economists mostly noted how new taxes would cut consumer spending and further slow down the economy.

The praise was mostly directed by those{{who|date=July 2018}} who believed that the government had finally taken a stronger stance against political corruption, while others{{who|date=July 2018}} criticized the fact that most suspects were, in fact, members of Kosor's own [[Croatian Democratic Union]]. The Opposition accused the government, especially the Prime Minister, for political responsibility claiming that it was impossible that Kosor didn't know what was happening around her when she was a Vice President of the government almost seven years before becoming Prime Minister.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} The accusations grew louder as more and more corruption affairs were tied with the former Prime Minister Ivo Sanader.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} On 30 October 2009 [[Damir Polan\u010dec]], member of the HDZ Presidency, resigned as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of the Economy following allegations of corruption.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VCFoDwAAQBAJ|title=Political Handbook of the World 2018-2019|editor-first=Tom|editor-last=Lansford|chapter=Croatia|year=2019|isbn=978-1-5443-2712-9}}</ref>\n\nOn 3 January 2010, Ivo Sanader announced he was returning to active politics saying it was a mistake he ever left.

On 4 January, the day after Sanader's ''coup'' as it was called by the press, the HDZ Presidency decided to evict Sanader from the party.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.jutarnji.hr/vijesti/hrvatska/ivo-sanader-izbacen-je-iz-hdz-a/2210571/|title=Ivo Sanader izba\u010den je iz HDZ-a!|publisher=}}</ref> The Croatian public quickly rallied in support of Kosor against the hugely unpopular former prime minister, resulting in the highest support for any Prime Minister since polling began, topping at 77% by the end of February.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vecernji.hr/vijesti/milanovic-preskocio-premijerku-kosor-po-popularnosti-149285|title=Milanovi\u0107 presko\u010dio premijerku Kosor po popularnosti|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nThroughout 2010, economy topped corruption as the biggest concern of the government, and the enthusiasm for Kosor and her government soon wore off. Industry shed tens of thousands of jobs, and unemployment soared. Consumer spending reduced drastically compared to record 2007 levels, causing widespread problems in the trade as well as transport industries. The import/export balance did derive a benefit from a large decrease in imports and a more tempered decrease in exports. The continuing declining standard resulted in a quick fall in both the Prime Minister's as well as government's support. In June, Kosor proposed loosening the labor law and making it more business-friendly. This was greatly opposed by the unions who have organized a petition against the proposed changes demanding a referendum on the issue. The petition was signed by over 700,000 citizens, unprecedented in Croatia. Just as the [[2010 Croatian labour law referendum]] was being prepared, the government decided to drop the proposed changes.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vecernji.hr/vijesti/kosor-milanovicu-ja-i-tebi-skupljam-placu-154892|title=Kosor: Milanovi\u0107u, ja i tebi skupljam pla\u0107u|publisher=}}</ref> The [[Constitutional Court of Croatia|Constitutional Court]] ultimately declared the referendum issue moot, but ordered the government not to subject any changes to the labor law in the following year.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.jutarnji.hr/vijesti/hrvatska/ustavni-sud-sindikatima-vi-ste-neznalice-koje-pozivaju-na-rusenje-drzave/1887987/|title=Ustavni sud sindikatima: Vi ste neznalice koje pozivaju na ru\u0161enje dr\u017eave|publisher=}}</ref> This was seen as a legal way to avoid the referendum which many speculated would be a referendum on the Government rather than on the labor law.

k\u0254\u0302s\u0254r|pron}}; born 1 July 1953) is a Croatian politician and former journalist who was the 9th [[Prime Minister of Croatia]] from 2009 to 2011, having taken office following the sudden resignation of her predecessor [[Ivo Sanader]]. Kosor was the [[List of elected or appointed female heads of government|first and so far only woman]] to become prime minister of Croatia since independence.<ref>Skard, Torild (2014) \"Croatia's Milka Planinc and Jadranka Kosor\" in ''Women of power - half a century of female presidents and prime ministers worldwide'', Bristol: Policy Press, {{ISBN|978-1-44731-578-0}}, pp. 326-33</ref>\n\nKosor started working as a [[journalist]], following her graduation from [[Faculty of Law, University of Zagreb|Zagreb Faculty of Law]]. During the [[Croatian War of Independence]], she hosted a radio show dealing with [[refugee]] problems and disabled [[war veteran]]s. She joined the [[centre-right]] [[Croatian Democratic Union]] (HDZ) in 1989 and quickly climbed up the party hierarchy. In 1995 she was elected party vice-president and was elected to serve in [[Croatian Parliament|Parliament]] for the first time. After the death of [[President of Croatia|President]] and longtime HDZ leader [[Franjo Tu\u0111man]], Kosor supported Ivo Sanader's successful party leadership bid in 2000. Three years later, her party won the [[2003 Croatian parliamentary election|parliamentary election]] and Kosor became the [[Ministry of Veterans' Affairs (Croatia)|Minister of Family, Veterans' Affairs and Inter-generational Solidarity]] in the [[Cabinet of Ivo Sanader I|Sanader I]] and, later, [[Cabinet of Ivo Sanader II|Sanader II cabinet]], during which time she served as Deputy Prime Minister as well. In the [[2005 Croatian presidential election|2005 presidential election]] she ran as a representative of HDZ, but lost to incumbent President [[Stipe Mesi\u0107]] in the second round. After the abrupt resignation of Sanader, Kosor managed to form a functioning [[parliamentary majority]] and was approved to her new post as Prime Minister in July 2009, also becoming leader of her party. Kosor was the party's candidate for Prime Minister in the [[2011 Croatian parliamentary election|2011 general election]], but HDZ lost in a landslide over the [[centre-left]] [[Kukuriku coalition]], led by the [[Social Democratic Party of Croatia|Social Democratic Party]]. Kosor handed power to the new Prime Minister, [[Zoran Milanovi\u0107]], in December 2011.\n\nAs Prime Minister, Kosor failed to commit to structural reforms although she managed to prevent country's budgetary meltdown with two budget revisions and the introduction of new taxes as a response to the ongoing economic crisis. During her tenure, she strongly advocated a zero-tolerance policy to political corruption and organized crime. This uncompromising stance, along with the new [[criminal code]] passed before her term began, opened the door to unprecedented efforts to combat corruption. This resulted in numerous arrests of influential business-people and politicians from across the political spectrum, although most of them members of HDZ, which severely damaged the party's reputation. The discoveries made by prosecutors were far-reaching and criminal charges were even raised against former Prime Minister Ivo Sanader and Deputy Prime Minister [[Damir Polan\u010dec]], who would later be charged with lengthy prison sentences for criminal activity and abuse of power. In [[foreign policy]], Kosor and her [[Slovenia]]n counterpart [[Borut Pahor]] were successful in solving the long-standing border dispute and she is credited with successfully finishing the negotiating process of the [[Accession of Croatia to the European Union|Croatian accession]] to the [[European Union]].

Industry shed tens of thousands of jobs, and unemployment soared. Consumer spending reduced drastically compared to record 2007 levels, causing widespread problems in the trade as well as transport industries. The import/export balance did derive a benefit from a large decrease in imports and a more tempered decrease in exports. The continuing declining standard resulted in a quick fall in both the Prime Minister's as well as government's support. In June, Kosor proposed loosening the labor law and making it more business-friendly. This was greatly opposed by the unions who have organized a petition against the proposed changes demanding a referendum on the issue. The petition was signed by over 700,000 citizens, unprecedented in Croatia. Just as the [[2010 Croatian labour law referendum]] was being prepared, the government decided to drop the proposed changes.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vecernji.hr/vijesti/kosor-milanovicu-ja-i-tebi-skupljam-placu-154892|title=Kosor: Milanovi\u0107u, ja i tebi skupljam pla\u0107u|publisher=}}</ref> The [[Constitutional Court of Croatia|Constitutional Court]] ultimately declared the referendum issue moot, but ordered the government not to subject any changes to the labor law in the following year.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.jutarnji.hr/vijesti/hrvatska/ustavni-sud-sindikatima-vi-ste-neznalice-koje-pozivaju-na-rusenje-drzave/1887987/|title=Ustavni sud sindikatima: Vi ste neznalice koje pozivaju na ru\u0161enje dr\u017eave|publisher=}}</ref> This was seen as a legal way to avoid the referendum which many speculated would be a referendum on the Government rather than on the labor law.

Rico progresses from recruit to [[officer (armed forces)|officer]] against the backdrop of an interstellar war between humans and an alien species known as \"Arachnids\" or \"Bugs\". Interspersed with the primary plot are classroom scenes in which Rico and others discuss philosophical and moral issues, including aspects of [[suffrage]], [[civic virtue]], [[juvenile delinquency]], and [[war]]; these discussions have been described as expounding Heinlein's own political views.<ref name=\"EOLAIS\">{{cite encyclopedia|editor-last1=Kent|editor-first1=Allen|editor-last2=Lancour|editor-first2=Harold|editor-last3=Daily|editor-first3=Jay E.|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Library and Information Science: Volume 29|publisher=[[Marcel Dekker]]|title=Stories|last=Daily|first=Jay E.|year=1980|isbn=9780824720292|page=151|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8WOFlMCzqEIC}}</ref> ''Starship Troopers'' has been identified with a tradition of [[militarism]] in U.S. science fiction,{{sfn|Suvin|2008|p=122}} and draws parallels between the conflict between humans and the Bugs, and the [[Cold War]].{{sfn|Booker|Thomas|2009|p=218}} A [[Coming of age|coming-of-age]] novel, ''Starship Troopers'' also critiques U.S. society of the 1950s, argues that a lack of discipline had led to a moral decline, and suggests [[corporal punishment|corporal]] and [[capital punishment]] to combat it.<ref name=\"EOLAIS\" />{{sfn|Booker|Thomas|2009|pp=215\u2013216}}\n\n''Starship Troopers'' brought to an end [[Heinlein juveniles|Heinlein's series of juvenile novels]]. It became one of his best-selling books, and is considered his most widely known work.<ref name=\"Mcmilllan\"/> It won the [[Hugo Award for Best Novel]] in 1960,<ref name=\"Hubble\"/> and garnered praise from reviewers for its scenes of training and combat and its visualization of a future military.<ref name=Myers/>{{sfn|Macleod|2003|p=233}} It also became enormously controversial because of the political views it seemed to support. Reviewers were strongly critical of the book's intentional glorification of the military,{{sfn|Heinlein|2003|p=484}}{{sfn|Booker|Thomas|2009|pp=155\u2013156}} an aspect described as [[propaganda]] and likened to [[military recruitment|recruitment]].{{sfn|Franklin|1980|pp=111\u2013112}} The book's focus on the miltiary and the fact that only federal service veterans, not necessarily military vets, had the privilege of voting and running for office in the novel's fictional society led to it being frequently described as [[Fascism|fascist]].{{sfn|Booker|Thomas|2009|pp=155\u2013156}}{{sfn|Cass|1999|p=52}}<ref name=\"Goss\" /> Others disagree, arguing that Heinlein was exploring the idea of limiting the privilege of voting to those who've taken responsability and earned it.<ref name=\"JW\" /> \n\n''Starship Troopers'' had wide influence both within and outside science fiction. [[Ken MacLeod]] stated that \"the political strand in [science fiction] can be described as a dialogue with Heinlein\".{{sfn|Macleod|2003|p=231}} Science fiction critic [[Darko Suvin]] wrote that ''Starship Troopers'' is the \"ancestral text of U.S. science fiction militarism\" and that it shaped the debate about the role of the military in society for many years.{{sfn|Suvin|2008|p=123}} The novel has been credited with popularizing the idea of [[Powered exoskeleton|powered armor]], which has since become a recurring feature in science fiction books and films, as well as an object of scientific research.<ref name=\"Liptak\"/> Heinlein's depiction of a futuristic military was also influential.{{sfn|Booker|Thomas|2009|p=221}} Later science fiction books such as [[Joe Haldeman]]'s anti-war novel ''[[The Forever War]]'' have been described as reactions to ''Starship Troopers''.<ref name=JH/> The story has been adapted several times, including in a [[Starship Troopers (film)|1997 film version]] directed by [[Paul Verhoeven]], who hand't even read it<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.empireonline.com/movies/features/paul-verhoeven/|title=Triple Dutch: Paul Verhoeven's sci-fi trilogy|website=Empire|language=en-GB|access-date=2020-04-10}}</ref>yet treid to satirize it.<ref name=Strzelczyk/> \n\n==Writing and publication==\n[[File:StarshipSoldier.jpg|thumb|The cover of ''[[The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction]]'' (November 1959), illustrating ''Starship Soldier'']]\nRobert Heinlein was among the best-selling science fiction authors of the 1940s and 1950s, along with [[Isaac Asimov]] and [[Arthur C.

His experience in the military profoundly influenced his fiction.{{sfn|Booker|Thomas|2009|p=47}} At some point between 1958 and 1959, Heinlein put aside the novel that would become ''[[Stranger in a Strange Land]]'' and wrote ''Starship Troopers''. His motivation arose partially from his anger at U.S. President [[Dwight Eisenhower]]'s [[Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty|decision to suspend U.S. nuclear tests]], and the Soviet tests that occurred soon afterward.<ref name=\"Gifford\"/> Writing in his 1980 volume ''[[Expanded Universe (book)|Expanded Universe]]'', Heinlein would say that the publication of a newspaper advertisement placed by the [[National Committee for a Sane Nuclear Policy]] on April 5, 1958, calling for a unilateral suspension of [[nuclear weapons testing]] by the United States sparked his desire to write ''Starship Troopers''.{{sfn|Heinlein|2003|pp=468\u2013469}} Heinlein and his wife [[Virginia Heinlein|Virginia]] created the \"[[Who Are the Heirs of Patrick Henry?|Patrick Henry League]]\" in an attempt to create support for the U.S. nuclear testing program. Heinlein stated that he used the novel to clarify his military and political views.{{sfn|Heinlein|2003|pp=468\u2013469, 481\u2013482}} \n\nAs was the case with many of Heinlein's books, ''Starship Troopers'' was completed in a few weeks. It was originally written as a [[Young adult fiction|juvenile novel]] for New York publishing house [[Charles Scribner's Sons|Scribner]]; Heinlein had previously had success with this format, having written several such novels published by Scribner.

The \"Pseudo-Arachnids\" or \"[[Bug (Starship Troopers)|Bugs]]\" are shown as communal beings originating from the planet of Klendathu. They have multiple castes; workers, soldiers, brains, and queens, similar to [[ant]]s and [[termite]]s. The soldiers are the only ones who fight, and never surrender.{{sfn|Heinlein|1987|pp=170\u2013180}} The \"Skinnies\" are depicted as less communal than the Arachnids but more so than human beings.{{sfn|Franklin|1980|p=118}} The events of the novel take place during an interstellar war between the Terran Federation and the Arachnids.{{sfn|Panshin|1968|loc=chpt. 5, sec. 5}} At the beginning of the story, Earth is not at war, but war has been declared by the time Rico has completed his training.<ref name=\"Gifford\"/> The Skinnies are initially allies of the Pseudo-Arachnids, but switch to being allies of the humans midway through the novel.{{sfn|Franklin|1980|p=118}} [[Faster-than-light]] travel exists in this future: spacecraft operate under the \"Cherenkov drive\", and can travel \"Sol to Capella, forty-six lightyears, in under six weeks\".{{sfn|Heinlein|1987|pp=262\u2013268}}\n{{anchor|History and Moral Philosophy}}\n''Starship Troopers'' is narrated by the main protagonist Juan \"Johnny\" Rico, a member of the \"Mobile Infantry\".

The platoon carries out a raid against a planetary colony held by Skinnies.<ref name=\"Magill\"/> The raid is relatively brief: the platoon lands on the planet, destroys its targets, and retreats, suffering two casualties in the process. One of them, Dizzy Flores, dies while returning to orbit.{{sfn|Heinlein|1987|loc=chpt. 1}} The narrative then flashes back to Rico's graduation from high school. Rico and his best friend Carl are considering joining the Federal Service after graduation; Rico is hesitant, partly due to his father's attitude towards the military.<ref name=\"Gifford\"/> Rico makes his decision after discovering that his classmate Carmen Iba\u00f1ez also intends to enlist.{{sfn|Heinlein|1987|p=26-45}}\n\nRico's choice is taken poorly by his parents, and he leaves with a sense of estrangement.

He congratulates Rico on having gotten so far in his service, saying he hadn't written sooner because he wanted to ensure Rico was serious about his service.{{sfn|Heinlein|1987|pp=120\u2013130}} Rico himself is given five lashes for firing a rocket during a drill with armored suits and simulated nuclear weapons without checking to see that no friendlies were within the blast zone, which in combat would have resulted in the death of a fellow soldier.{{sfn|Heinlein|1987|pp=130\u2013140}} Another recruit, who murdered a baby girl after deserting the army, is hanged by his battalion after his arrest by civilian police.{{sfn|Heinlein|1987|pp=130\u2013140}} Eventually, after further training at another camp near [[Vancouver]], Rico graduates with 187 others, of the 2,009 who had begun training in that regiment.{{sfn|Heinlein|1987|pp=165\u2013175}}\n\nThe \"Bug War\" has changed from border incidents to a full-scale war during Rico's training.

Instead, much of the novel is given over to a discussion of ideas.{{sfn|Booker|Thomas|2009|p=215}} In particular, the discussion of political views is a recurring feature of what scholar Jeffrey Cass described as an \"ideologically intense\" book.{{sfn|Cass|1999|p=52}} A 1997 review in ''[[Salon (magazine)|Salon]]'' categorized it as a \"[[Philosophical fiction|philosophical novel]]\".<ref name=\"Salon\"/> Critics have debated to what extent the novel promotes Heinlein's own political views. Some contend that it's goal is to say we should be ready to do what must be done for our and our civilization's future, others argue that Heinlein is sermonizing throughout the book, and that its purpose is to expound Heinlein's militaristic philosophy.{{sfn|Cass|1999|p=52}}<ref name=\"JW\" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVpYvV0O7uI&t=2744s|title=Starship Troopers in reality|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n===Military culture===\n''Starship Troopers'' has been identified as being a part of a tradition in U.S. science fiction that assumes that war is inevitable.{{sfn|Suvin|2008|p=122}} Although the Mobile Infantry, the unit to which Rico is assigned, is seen as a lowly post by the characters in the story, the novel itself suggests that it is the heart of the army and the most honorable unit in it.{{sfn|Booker|Thomas|2009|p=217}} In a commentary written in 1980, Heinlein agreed that ''Starship Troopers'' \"glorifies the military ... Specifically the P.B.I., the [[Poor Bloody Infantry]], the mudfoot who places his frail body between his loved home and the war's desolation \u2013 but is rarely appreciated... he has the toughest job of all and should be honored.\"{{sfn|Heinlein|2003|p=484}} The story is based on the [[Social Darwinism|social Darwinist]] idea of society an extention of nature and thus requiring competition. It suggests that some conflicts must be resolved by force: one of the lessons Rico is repeatedly taught is that violence is often necessary and, when applied well, effective. When Mr Dubois is told by a school girl that her mom tells her violence is never the answer, he assures her the fathers of Carthage would love to know that.<ref name=\"Magill\"/><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Starship_Troopers|title=Starship Troopers - Wikiquote|website=en.wikiquote.org|language=en|access-date=2020-04-10}}</ref>These suggestions derive in part from Heinlein's view that in the 1950s the U.S. government was being too conciliatory in its dealings with communist China and the Soviet Union.<ref name=\"Goss\" />{{sfn|Booker|Thomas|2009|p=215}}{{sfn|Macleod|2003|pp=232\u2013233}}{{sfn|King|1998|p=1021}}\n\nHeinlein draws an analogy between the human society in the novel, which is well-to-do but needs to be vigilant against the imperialist threat of the Arachnids, and U.S. society of the 1950s. Reviewers have suggested that the Arachnids are Heinlein's analogue for communists. Traits used to support this include the communal nature of the Arachnids, which makes them capable of a much higher degree of coordination than the humans. Bug society is once explicitly described as communist, and is moreover depicted as communist by nature, describing the bug commanders as commisars who cared little about expending soldiers. The related motifs of alien invasion, patriotism, and personal sacrifice during war, are present, as are other aspects of U.S. popular culture of the 1950s.<ref name=\"Goss\">{{cite journal|last1=Goss|first1=Jasper|title=Reviewed Work(s): Starship Troopers by Robert A. Heinlein; Starship Troopers by PaulVerhoeven|journal=Australasian Journal of American Studies|date=Jul 1998|volume=17|issue=1|pages=54\u201356|jstor=41415952}}</ref> Commentators have argued that Heinlein's portrayal of aliens, as well as being a reference to communists, invokes the trope of a return to the [[Frontier Thesis|frontier]]. The concept of the frontier includes a social-Darwinist argument of constantly fighting for survival against all threats and at all costs. Heinlein says if humans don't stay the dominant species, they'll be violently and brutally killed and replaced, in this case by the bugs.{{sfn|King|1998|pp=1022\u20131023}}\n\n===Coming of age===\n''Starship Troopers'' has been referred to as a ''[[bildungsroman]]'' or \"[[coming-of-age]]\" story for Rico, as he matures through his tenure in the infantry. His training, both at boot camp and at officer candidate school, involves learning the values of responsaiblity, discipline, and responsability and authority going hand in hand, thus inviting the reader to learn as well. This includes being taught why privileges, such as voting and holding public office, should be earned trough a 2 year term of gruelling federal service and the privilege of voting then exercised after paying poll taxes. The story traces Rico's transformation from a boy into a citizen, while exploring issues of identity and motivation,<ref name=\"JW\" /> and traces his overall moral and social development. Rico's transformation has been likened to the common narrative within stories with military themes by scholar [[Howard Franklin]]. This typical narrative is that of a sloppy and unfit civilian being knocked into shape by tough officers, whose training is very calculated, and is depicted as fundamentally being on the right side.{{sfn|Franklin|1980|p=111}} The letter Rico receives from Dubois, partly responsible for Rico \"crossing the hump\" with his training, is shown as a turning point in his development, as he said himself that after the hump, he felt different.<ref name=\"Magill\"/> The classroom scenes embedded in the story serve to explain Rico's adventures, and highlight his reactions to events around. A notable example is the execution Rico is forced to witness after a deserter from his unit murders a young girl; Rico is uncertain of his own reaction until he remembers a lecture by Dubois in which the latter argues that \"Morals \u2014 all correct moral laws \u2014 derive from the instinct to survive. '''Moral behavior is survival behavior above the individual level'''\". The concept of the American frontier is also related to the coming-of-age theme. Young protagonists across Heinlein's novels attain manhood by confronting a hostile \"wilderness\" in space; coming-of-age in a military, alien context is a common theme in Heinlein's earlier works as well.{{sfn|King|1998|pp=1019\u20131021}} Rico's coming-of-age has also been described as being related to his relationship with his father; the journey \"outward\" through the novel also contains a search for Rico's childhood and a reunion with his estranged parent.{{sfn|Slusser|1986|p=21}}\n\n===Morality===\n''Starship Troopers'' critiques the democracies of the 19th century. In the novel, the people had gotten spoiled on rights and lost track of responsibilities.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/2534973-starship-troopers|title=Starship Troopers Quotes by Robert A.

Kids are also corporally punished.\n\nDubois also argues that rights aren't inalienable.\n\nOn the right to life- \"What 'right' to life has a man who must die to save his children? If he chooses to save his own life, does he do so as a matter of 'right'? If two men are starving and cannibalism is the only alternative to death, which man's right is 'unalienable'?\"\n\nOn the right to liberty-  \"'''As to liberty, the heroes who signed the great document pledged themselves to ''buy'' liberty with their lives. Liberty is ''never'' unalienable; it must be redeemed regularly with the blood of patriots or it ''always'' vanishes.''' Of all the so-called natural human rights that have ever been invented, liberty is least likely to be cheap and is ''never'' free of cost.\"\n\nOn the right to happiness- \"The third 'right'?\u2014the 'pursuit of happiness'? It is indeed unalienable but it is not a right; it is simply a universal condition which tyrants cannot take away nor patriots restore. Cast me into a dungeon, burn me at the stake, crown me king of kings, I can 'pursue happiness' as long as my brain lives\u2014but neither gods nor saints, wise men nor subtle drugs, can ensure that I will catch it.\"\n\nDubois argues all morals come from the instict to survive and have to be taught.\n\n==Reception==\nTo Heinlein's surprise,{{sfn|Heinlein|2003|p=482}} ''Starship Troopers'' won the [[Hugo Award for Best Novel]] in 1960.<ref name=\"WWE-1960\">{{cite web |url= http://www.worldswithoutend.com/books_year_index.asp?year=1960 |title= 1960 Award Winners & Nominees |work= Worlds Without End |accessdate=July 27, 2009}}</ref> It has been acknowledged as one of the best-known and most influential works of science fiction.{{sfn|Macleod|2003|p=231}}<ref name=\"Mcmilllan\">{{cite news|last1=McMillan|first1=Graeme|title=Why 'Starship Troopers' May Be Too Controversial to Adapt Faithfully|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/starship-troopers-may-be-controversial-adapt-faithfully-944083|accessdate=May 8, 2017|work=Hollywood Reporter|date=November 3, 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"Liptak\">{{cite news|last1=Liptak|first1=Andrew|title=Four things that we want to see in the Starship Troopers reboot|url=https://www.theverge.com/2016/11/3/13511716/starship-troopers-reboot-things-we-want-to-see|accessdate=May 9, 2017|work=The Verge|date=November 3, 2016}}</ref> The novel is considered a landmark for the genre, having been described by a 1960 review as one of the ten best genre books of 1959,<ref>{{cite journal|last=Knight|first=Damon|title=Books|journal=[[F&SF]]|date=April 1960|page=98}}</ref> in a 2009 review as a key science fiction novel of the 1950s,{{sfn|Booker|Thomas|2009|pp=155\u2013156}} and as the best-known example of [[military science fiction]].{{sfn|Booker|Thomas|2009|pp=102}} It was also a personal landmark for Heinlein; it was one of his best-selling books, and is his best-known novel.<ref name=\"Mcmilllan\"/> The novel has been described as marking Heinlein's transition from writing juvenile fiction to a \"more mature phase\" as an author.<ref name=\"Hubble\"/> Reviewing the book with others written for children, [[Floyd C.

Service is voluntary and most citizens wanabes don't do military but other  federal service to earn citizenship. The book takes palce during a war, so it shouldn't be shocking it focuses on the military.\n\n===Allegations of Fascism===\nThe society within the book has frequently been described as [[Fascism|fascist]].{{sfn|Booker|Thomas|2009|pp=155\u2013156}}{{sfn|Cass|1999|p=52}}<ref name=\"Goss\" /> According to the 2009 ''Science Fiction Handbook'', it had the effect of giving Heinlein a reputation as a \"fanatical warmongering fascist\".{{sfn|Booker|Thomas|2009|p=214}} Scholar Jeffrey Cass has referred to the setting of the book as \"unremittingly grim fascism\". He has stated that the novel made an analogy between its military conflict and those of the U.S. after World War II, and that it justified [[American imperialism|U.S. imperialism]] in the name of fighting another form of imperialism.{{sfn|Cass|1999|pp=52\u201353}} Jasper Goss has referred to it as \"[[crypto-fascist]]\".<ref name=\"Goss\" /> Suvin compares Heinlein's suggestion that \"all wars arise from population pressure\" to the Nazi concept of ''[[Lebensraum]]'' or \"living space\" for a superior society that was used to justify territorial expansion.{{sfn|Suvin|2008|pp=124\u2013125}}\n\nSome reviewers have suggested that Heinlein was simply discussing the merits of a selective versus a nonselective franchise.<ref name=\"JW\" /> Heinlein made a similar claim, over two decades after ''Starship Troopers'''s publication, in his ''[[Expanded Universe (book)|Expanded Universe]]'' and further claimed that 95 percent of \"veterans\" were not military personnel but members of the civil service.{{sfn|Heinlein|2003|pp=396\u2013404}}\n\nDennis Showalter, writing in 1975, defended ''Starship Troopers'', stating that the society depicted in it did not contain many elements of fascism. He argues that the novel does not include outright opposition to [[bolshevism]] and [[liberalism]] that would be expected in a fascist society.{{sfn|Cass|1999|pp=52\u201353}} Ken Macleod argues that the book does not actually advocate fascism because anybody capable of understanding the oath of Federal Service is able to enlist and thereby obtain political power.{{sfn|Macleod|2003|p=233}}\n\nArguments that the book is a liberal utopia and the complete opposite of Fascism are that service is voluntary and, as the book itself says, \"...our system works quite well.

Heinlein]]. Written in a few weeks in reaction to the U.S. [[Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty#Negotiations|suspending nuclear tests]],<ref name=\"Gifford\"/> the story was first published as a two-part serial in ''[[The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction]]'' as '''''Starship Soldier''''', and published as a book by [[G. P. Putnam's Sons]] in December 1959.\n\nThe story is set in a future society ruled by a human interstellar government with a ruling class of citizens who've completed federal service, referred to as the [[Terran Federation (Starship Troopers)|''Terran Federation'']].{{sfn|Booker|Thomas|2009|p=214}} The [[first-person narrative]] follows [[Juan Rico|Juan \"Johnny\" Rico]] through his military service in the Mobile Infantry. Rico progresses from recruit to [[officer (armed forces)|officer]] against the backdrop of an interstellar war between humans and an alien species known as \"Arachnids\" or \"Bugs\". Interspersed with the primary plot are classroom scenes in which Rico and others discuss philosophical and moral issues, including aspects of [[suffrage]], [[civic virtue]], [[juvenile delinquency]], and [[war]]; these discussions have been described as expounding Heinlein's own political views.<ref name=\"EOLAIS\">{{cite encyclopedia|editor-last1=Kent|editor-first1=Allen|editor-last2=Lancour|editor-first2=Harold|editor-last3=Daily|editor-first3=Jay E.|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Library and Information Science: Volume 29|publisher=[[Marcel Dekker]]|title=Stories|last=Daily|first=Jay E.|year=1980|isbn=9780824720292|page=151|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8WOFlMCzqEIC}}</ref> ''Starship Troopers'' has been identified with a tradition of [[militarism]] in U.S. science fiction,{{sfn|Suvin|2008|p=122}} and draws parallels between the conflict between humans and the Bugs, and the [[Cold War]].{{sfn|Booker|Thomas|2009|p=218}} A [[Coming of age|coming-of-age]] novel, ''Starship Troopers'' also critiques U.S. society of the 1950s, argues that a lack of discipline had led to a moral decline, and suggests [[corporal punishment|corporal]] and [[capital punishment]] to combat it.<ref name=\"EOLAIS\" />{{sfn|Booker|Thomas|2009|pp=215\u2013216}}\n\n''Starship Troopers'' brought to an end [[Heinlein juveniles|Heinlein's series of juvenile novels]]. It became one of his best-selling books, and is considered his most widely known work.<ref name=\"Mcmilllan\"/> It won the [[Hugo Award for Best Novel]] in 1960,<ref name=\"Hubble\"/> and garnered praise from reviewers for its scenes of training and combat and its visualization of a future military.<ref name=Myers/>{{sfn|Macleod|2003|p=233}} It also became enormously controversial because of the political views it seemed to support. Reviewers were strongly critical of the book's intentional glorification of the military,{{sfn|Heinlein|2003|p=484}}{{sfn|Booker|Thomas|2009|pp=155\u2013156}} an aspect described as [[propaganda]] and likened to [[military recruitment|recruitment]].{{sfn|Franklin|1980|pp=111\u2013112}} The book's focus on the miltiary and the fact that only federal service veterans, not necessarily military vets, had the privilege of voting and running for office in the novel's fictional society led to it being frequently described as [[Fascism|fascist]].{{sfn|Booker|Thomas|2009|pp=155\u2013156}}{{sfn|Cass|1999|p=52}}<ref name=\"Goss\" /> Others disagree, arguing that Heinlein was exploring the idea of limiting the privilege of voting to those who've taken responsability and earned it.<ref name=\"JW\" /> \n\n''Starship Troopers'' had wide influence both within and outside science fiction. [[Ken MacLeod]] stated that \"the political strand in [science fiction] can be described as a dialogue with Heinlein\".{{sfn|Macleod|2003|p=231}} Science fiction critic [[Darko Suvin]] wrote that ''Starship Troopers'' is the \"ancestral text of U.S. science fiction militarism\" and that it shaped the debate about the role of the military in society for many years.{{sfn|Suvin|2008|p=123}} The novel has been credited with popularizing the idea of [[Powered exoskeleton|powered armor]], which has since become a recurring feature in science fiction books and films, as well as an object of scientific research.<ref name=\"Liptak\"/> Heinlein's depiction of a futuristic military was also influential.{{sfn|Booker|Thomas|2009|p=221}} Later science fiction books such as [[Joe Haldeman]]'s anti-war novel ''[[The Forever War]]'' have been described as reactions to ''Starship Troopers''.<ref name=JH/> The story has been adapted several times, including in a [[Starship Troopers (film)|1997 film version]] directed by [[Paul Verhoeven]], who hand't even read it<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.empireonline.com/movies/features/paul-verhoeven/|title=Triple Dutch: Paul Verhoeven's sci-fi trilogy|website=Empire|language=en-GB|access-date=2020-04-10}}</ref>yet treid to satirize it.<ref name=Strzelczyk/> \n\n==Writing and publication==\n[[File:StarshipSoldier.jpg|thumb|The cover of ''[[The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction]]'' (November 1959), illustrating ''Starship Soldier'']]\nRobert Heinlein was among the best-selling science fiction authors of the 1940s and 1950s, along with [[Isaac Asimov]] and [[Arthur C. Clarke]]; they were known as the \"big three\" that dominated U.S. science fiction. In contrast to the others, Heinlein firmly endorsed the anti-communist sentiment of the [[Cold War]] era in his writing.<ref>{{cite book |last=Parrinder |first=Patrick |title=Learning from Other Worlds: Estrangement, Cognition, and the Politics of Science Fiction and Utopia |publisher=Liverpool University Press |location= [[Trowbridge]], UK|year=2000|page=81 |isbn= 978-0-8223-2773-8}}</ref> Heinlein served in the U.S. Navy for five years after graduating from the [[United States Naval Academy]] in 1929. His experience in the military profoundly influenced his fiction.{{sfn|Booker|Thomas|2009|p=47}} At some point between 1958 and 1959, Heinlein put aside the novel that would become ''[[Stranger in a Strange Land]]'' and wrote ''Starship Troopers''. His motivation arose partially from his anger at U.S. President [[Dwight Eisenhower]]'s [[Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty|decision to suspend U.S. nuclear tests]], and the Soviet tests that occurred soon afterward.<ref name=\"Gifford\"/> Writing in his 1980 volume ''[[Expanded Universe (book)|Expanded Universe]]'', Heinlein would say that the publication of a newspaper advertisement placed by the [[National Committee for a Sane Nuclear Policy]] on April 5, 1958, calling for a unilateral suspension of [[nuclear weapons testing]] by the United States sparked his desire to write ''Starship Troopers''.{{sfn|Heinlein|2003|pp=468\u2013469}} Heinlein and his wife [[Virginia Heinlein|Virginia]] created the \"[[Who Are the Heirs of Patrick Henry?|Patrick Henry League]]\" in an attempt to create support for the U.S. nuclear testing program. Heinlein stated that he used the novel to clarify his military and political views.{{sfn|Heinlein|2003|pp=468\u2013469, 481\u2013482}} \n\nAs was the case with many of Heinlein's books, ''Starship Troopers'' was completed in a few weeks. It was originally written as a [[Young adult fiction|juvenile novel]] for New York publishing house [[Charles Scribner's Sons|Scribner]]; Heinlein had previously had success with this format, having written several such novels published by Scribner. The manuscript was rejected, prompting Heinlein to end his association with the publisher completely, and resume writing books with adult themes.<ref name=\"Gifford\">{{cite web|last=Gifford| first=James| url=http://www.nitrosyncretic.com/rah/ftp/fedrlsvc.pdf| title=The Nature of Federal Service in Robert A.

The \"Pseudo-Arachnids\" or \"[[Bug (Starship Troopers)|Bugs]]\" are shown as communal beings originating from the planet of Klendathu. They have multiple castes; workers, soldiers, brains, and queens, similar to [[ant]]s and [[termite]]s. The soldiers are the only ones who fight, and never surrender.{{sfn|Heinlein|1987|pp=170\u2013180}} The \"Skinnies\" are depicted as less communal than the Arachnids but more so than human beings.{{sfn|Franklin|1980|p=118}} The events of the novel take place during an interstellar war between the Terran Federation and the Arachnids.{{sfn|Panshin|1968|loc=chpt. 5, sec. 5}} At the beginning of the story, Earth is not at war, but war has been declared by the time Rico has completed his training.<ref name=\"Gifford\"/> The Skinnies are initially allies of the Pseudo-Arachnids, but switch to being allies of the humans midway through the novel.{{sfn|Franklin|1980|p=118}} [[Faster-than-light]] travel exists in this future: spacecraft operate under the \"Cherenkov drive\", and can travel \"Sol to Capella, forty-six lightyears, in under six weeks\".{{sfn|Heinlein|1987|pp=262\u2013268}}\n{{anchor|History and Moral Philosophy}}\n''Starship Troopers'' is narrated by the main protagonist Juan \"Johnny\" Rico, a member of the \"Mobile Infantry\". It is one of the few Heinlein novels which intersperses his typical linear narrative structure with a series of flashbacks.<ref name=\"Gifford\"/>{{sfn|Panshin|1968|loc=chpt. 5, sec. 5}} These flashbacks are frequently to Rico's History and Moral Philosophy course in school, in which the teacher discusses the history of the structure of their society.<ref name=\"Gifford\" /><ref name=\"JW\" /> Rico is depicted as a man of [[Filipinos|Filipino ancestry]]. He is from a wealthy family, whose members hadn't done federal service for 100 years.<ref name=\"Gifford\"/><ref name=\"Magill\"/>{{sfn|Franklin|1980|p=111}} Rico's ancestry is depicted to be a thing of no consequence; the society he lives in appears to have abandoned racial and sex-based prejudice.<ref name=\"Magill\"/>\n\n==Plot==\n{{further |List of Starship Troopers characters}}\n\nThe novel opens with Rico aboard the corvette transport ''Rodger Young'' (named after [[Medal of Honor]] recipient [[Rodger Wilton Young]]),{{sfn|Heinlein|1987|pp=345\u2013352}} serving with the platoon known as \"Rasczak's Roughnecks\". The platoon carries out a raid against a planetary colony held by Skinnies.<ref name=\"Magill\"/> The raid is relatively brief: the platoon lands on the planet, destroys its targets, and retreats, suffering two casualties in the process. One of them, Dizzy Flores, dies while returning to orbit.{{sfn|Heinlein|1987|loc=chpt. 1}} The narrative then flashes back to Rico's graduation from high school. Rico and his best friend Carl are considering joining the Federal Service after graduation; Rico is hesitant, partly due to his father's attitude towards the military.<ref name=\"Gifford\"/> Rico makes his decision after discovering that his classmate Carmen Iba\u00f1ez also intends to enlist.{{sfn|Heinlein|1987|p=26-45}}\n\nRico's choice is taken poorly by his parents, and he leaves with a sense of estrangement. He is assigned to the Mobile Infantry, and moves to Camp Arthur Currie (named for [[Arthur Currie]] who rose through the ranks to General in WWI) on the Canadian prairie for his training under Sergeant Charles Zim.{{sfn|Heinlein|1987|pp=50\u201361}} The training is extremely demanding.{{sfn|Booker|Thomas|2009|p=217}} Rico receives combat training of all types, including simulated fights in armored suits.{{sfn|Heinlein|1987|pp=80\u201395}}{{sfn|Heinlein|1987|pp=105\u2013110}} A fellow recruit is court-martialled, flogged, and dismissed for striking a drill instructor who was also his company commander.{{sfn|Heinlein|1987|pp=95\u2013105}} [[Jean V. Dubois]], who taught Rico's [[#History_and_Moral_Philosophy|History and Moral Philosophy]] in school, sends Rico a letter, revealing that he is a Mobile Infantry veteran himself. He congratulates Rico on having gotten so far in his service, saying he hadn't written sooner because he wanted to ensure Rico was serious about his service.{{sfn|Heinlein|1987|pp=120\u2013130}} Rico himself is given five lashes for firing a rocket during a drill with armored suits and simulated nuclear weapons without checking to see that no friendlies were within the blast zone, which in combat would have resulted in the death of a fellow soldier.{{sfn|Heinlein|1987|pp=130\u2013140}} Another recruit, who murdered a baby girl after deserting the army, is hanged by his battalion after his arrest by civilian police.{{sfn|Heinlein|1987|pp=130\u2013140}} Eventually, after further training at another camp near [[Vancouver]], Rico graduates with 187 others, of the 2,009 who had begun training in that regiment.{{sfn|Heinlein|1987|pp=165\u2013175}}\n\nThe \"Bug War\" has changed from border incidents to a full-scale war during Rico's training. An Arachnid attack that annihilates the city of [[Buenos Aires]] alerts civilians to the situation; Rico's mother is killed in the attack.{{sfn|Heinlein|1987|pp=170\u2013190}} Rico participates in the Battle of Klendathu, an attack on the Arachnid's home world, which turns into a disastrous defeat for the Terran Federation.{{sfn|Heinlein|1987|pp=175\u2013185}} Rico's ship, the ''Valley Forge'', is destroyed, and his unit is decimated; he is reassigned to the Roughnecks on board the ''Rodger Young,'' led by Lieutenant Rasczak and Sergeant Jelal.{{sfn|Heinlein|1987|pp=180\u2013190}} The unit carries out several raids, and Rico is promoted to corporal by Jelal, after Rasczak dies in combat.{{sfn|Heinlein|1987|pp=187\u2013200}}\n\nOne of his comrades in the Roughnecks suggests that Rico go to officer training school and try to become an officer. Rico ends up going to see Jelal, and finds that Jelal already had the paperwork ready. Rico enters [[Officer Candidate School]] for a second course of training, including further courses in \"History and Moral Philosophy\".{{sfn|Heinlein|1987|pp=205\u2013215}}{{sfn|Heinlein|1987|pp=240\u2013250}} En route from the Roughnecks to the school, Rico encounters his father, who has also enlisted and is now a corporal, and the two reconcile. He is also visited in school by Carmen, now an ensign and ship's pilot officer in the Navy, and the two discuss their friend Carl, who had been killed earlier in the war.{{sfn|Heinlein|1987|loc=chpt. 12}}\n\nRico is commissioned a temporary third lieutenant for his final test: a posting to a combat unit. Under the tutelage of his company commander, Captain Blackstone, and with the aid of his platoon sergeant, his boot camp drill instructor Fleet Sergeant Zim, who was reassigned from Mobile Infantry boot camp (Camp Currie), Rico commands a platoon during \"Operation Royalty\", a raid to capture members of the Arachnid brain caste and queens.{{sfn|Heinlein|1987|loc=chpt. 13}} Rico then returns to the officer school to graduate.\n\nThe novel ends with him holding the rank of Second Lieutenant, in command of his old platoon in the ''Rodger Young'', with his father as his platoon sergeant. The platoon has been renamed \"Rico's Roughnecks\", and is about to participate in an attack on Klendathu.{{sfn|Heinlein|1987|loc=chpt. 14}}\n\n==Major themes==\n[[File:Heinlein-face.jpg|thumb|Robert Heinlein, pictured here in 1976]]\nCommentators have written that ''Starship Troopers'' is not driven by its plot, though it contains scenes of military combat. Instead, much of the novel is given over to a discussion of ideas.{{sfn|Booker|Thomas|2009|p=215}} In particular, the discussion of political views is a recurring feature of what scholar Jeffrey Cass described as an \"ideologically intense\" book.{{sfn|Cass|1999|p=52}} A 1997 review in ''[[Salon (magazine)|Salon]]'' categorized it as a \"[[Philosophical fiction|philosophical novel]]\".<ref name=\"Salon\"/> Critics have debated to what extent the novel promotes Heinlein's own political views. Some contend that it's goal is to say we should be ready to do what must be done for our and our civilization's future, others argue that Heinlein is sermonizing throughout the book, and that its purpose is to expound Heinlein's militaristic philosophy.{{sfn|Cass|1999|p=52}}<ref name=\"JW\" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVpYvV0O7uI&t=2744s|title=Starship Troopers in reality|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n===Military culture===\n''Starship Troopers'' has been identified as being a part of a tradition in U.S. science fiction that assumes that war is inevitable.{{sfn|Suvin|2008|p=122}} Although the Mobile Infantry, the unit to which Rico is assigned, is seen as a lowly post by the characters in the story, the novel itself suggests that it is the heart of the army and the most honorable unit in it.{{sfn|Booker|Thomas|2009|p=217}} In a commentary written in 1980, Heinlein agreed that ''Starship Troopers'' \"glorifies the military ... Specifically the P.B.I., the [[Poor Bloody Infantry]], the mudfoot who places his frail body between his loved home and the war's desolation \u2013 but is rarely appreciated... he has the toughest job of all and should be honored.\"{{sfn|Heinlein|2003|p=484}} The story is based on the [[Social Darwinism|social Darwinist]] idea of society an extention of nature and thus requiring competition. It suggests that some conflicts must be resolved by force: one of the lessons Rico is repeatedly taught is that violence is often necessary and, when applied well, effective. When Mr Dubois is told by a school girl that her mom tells her violence is never the answer, he assures her the fathers of Carthage would love to know that.<ref name=\"Magill\"/><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Starship_Troopers|title=Starship Troopers - Wikiquote|website=en.wikiquote.org|language=en|access-date=2020-04-10}}</ref>These suggestions derive in part from Heinlein's view that in the 1950s the U.S. government was being too conciliatory in its dealings with communist China and the Soviet Union.<ref name=\"Goss\" />{{sfn|Booker|Thomas|2009|p=215}}{{sfn|Macleod|2003|pp=232\u2013233}}{{sfn|King|1998|p=1021}}\n\nHeinlein draws an analogy between the human society in the novel, which is well-to-do but needs to be vigilant against the imperialist threat of the Arachnids, and U.S. society of the 1950s. Reviewers have suggested that the Arachnids are Heinlein's analogue for communists. Traits used to support this include the communal nature of the Arachnids, which makes them capable of a much higher degree of coordination than the humans. Bug society is once explicitly described as communist, and is moreover depicted as communist by nature, describing the bug commanders as commisars who cared little about expending soldiers. The related motifs of alien invasion, patriotism, and personal sacrifice during war, are present, as are other aspects of U.S. popular culture of the 1950s.<ref name=\"Goss\">{{cite journal|last1=Goss|first1=Jasper|title=Reviewed Work(s): Starship Troopers by Robert A. Heinlein; Starship Troopers by PaulVerhoeven|journal=Australasian Journal of American Studies|date=Jul 1998|volume=17|issue=1|pages=54\u201356|jstor=41415952}}</ref> Commentators have argued that Heinlein's portrayal of aliens, as well as being a reference to communists, invokes the trope of a return to the [[Frontier Thesis|frontier]]. The concept of the frontier includes a social-Darwinist argument of constantly fighting for survival against all threats and at all costs. Heinlein says if humans don't stay the dominant species, they'll be violently and brutally killed and replaced, in this case by the bugs.{{sfn|King|1998|pp=1022\u20131023}}\n\n===Coming of age===\n''Starship Troopers'' has been referred to as a ''[[bildungsroman]]'' or \"[[coming-of-age]]\" story for Rico, as he matures through his tenure in the infantry. His training, both at boot camp and at officer candidate school, involves learning the values of responsaiblity, discipline, and responsability and authority going hand in hand, thus inviting the reader to learn as well. This includes being taught why privileges, such as voting and holding public office, should be earned trough a 2 year term of gruelling federal service and the privilege of voting then exercised after paying poll taxes. The story traces Rico's transformation from a boy into a citizen, while exploring issues of identity and motivation,<ref name=\"JW\" /> and traces his overall moral and social development. Rico's transformation has been likened to the common narrative within stories with military themes by scholar [[Howard Franklin]]. This typical narrative is that of a sloppy and unfit civilian being knocked into shape by tough officers, whose training is very calculated, and is depicted as fundamentally being on the right side.{{sfn|Franklin|1980|p=111}} The letter Rico receives from Dubois, partly responsible for Rico \"crossing the hump\" with his training, is shown as a turning point in his development, as he said himself that after the hump, he felt different.<ref name=\"Magill\"/> The classroom scenes embedded in the story serve to explain Rico's adventures, and highlight his reactions to events around. A notable example is the execution Rico is forced to witness after a deserter from his unit murders a young girl; Rico is uncertain of his own reaction until he remembers a lecture by Dubois in which the latter argues that \"Morals \u2014 all correct moral laws \u2014 derive from the instinct to survive. '''Moral behavior is survival behavior above the individual level'''\". The concept of the American frontier is also related to the coming-of-age theme. Young protagonists across Heinlein's novels attain manhood by confronting a hostile \"wilderness\" in space; coming-of-age in a military, alien context is a common theme in Heinlein's earlier works as well.{{sfn|King|1998|pp=1019\u20131021}} Rico's coming-of-age has also been described as being related to his relationship with his father; the journey \"outward\" through the novel also contains a search for Rico's childhood and a reunion with his estranged parent.{{sfn|Slusser|1986|p=21}}\n\n===Moral decline===\n''Starship Troopers'' critiques the democracies of the 19th century. In the novel, the people had gotten spoiled on rights and lost track of responsibilities.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/2534973-starship-troopers|title=Starship Troopers Quotes by Robert A.

Kids are also corporally punished.\n\nDubois also argues that rights aren't inalienable.\n\nOn the right to life- \"What 'right' to life has a man who must die to save his children? If he chooses to save his own life, does he do so as a matter of 'right'? If two men are starving and cannibalism is the only alternative to death, which man's right is 'unalienable'?\"\n\nOn the right to liberty-  \"'''As to liberty, the heroes who signed the great document pledged themselves to ''buy'' liberty with their lives. Liberty is ''never'' unalienable; it must be redeemed regularly with the blood of patriots or it ''always'' vanishes.''' Of all the so-called natural human rights that have ever been invented, liberty is least likely to be cheap and is ''never'' free of cost.\"\n\nOn the right to happiness- \"The third 'right'?\u2014the 'pursuit of happiness'? It is indeed unalienable but it is not a right; it is simply a universal condition which tyrants cannot take away nor patriots restore. Cast me into a dungeon, burn me at the stake, crown me king of kings, I can 'pursue happiness' as long as my brain lives\u2014but neither gods nor saints, wise men nor subtle drugs, can ensure that I will catch it.\"\n\n==Reception==\nTo Heinlein's surprise,{{sfn|Heinlein|2003|p=482}} ''Starship Troopers'' won the [[Hugo Award for Best Novel]] in 1960.<ref name=\"WWE-1960\">{{cite web |url= http://www.worldswithoutend.com/books_year_index.asp?year=1960 |title= 1960 Award Winners & Nominees |work= Worlds Without End |accessdate=July 27, 2009}}</ref> It has been acknowledged as one of the best-known and most influential works of science fiction.{{sfn|Macleod|2003|p=231}}<ref name=\"Mcmilllan\">{{cite news|last1=McMillan|first1=Graeme|title=Why 'Starship Troopers' May Be Too Controversial to Adapt Faithfully|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/starship-troopers-may-be-controversial-adapt-faithfully-944083|accessdate=May 8, 2017|work=Hollywood Reporter|date=November 3, 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"Liptak\">{{cite news|last1=Liptak|first1=Andrew|title=Four things that we want to see in the Starship Troopers reboot|url=https://www.theverge.com/2016/11/3/13511716/starship-troopers-reboot-things-we-want-to-see|accessdate=May 9, 2017|work=The Verge|date=November 3, 2016}}</ref> The novel is considered a landmark for the genre, having been described by a 1960 review as one of the ten best genre books of 1959,<ref>{{cite journal|last=Knight|first=Damon|title=Books|journal=[[F&SF]]|date=April 1960|page=98}}</ref> in a 2009 review as a key science fiction novel of the 1950s,{{sfn|Booker|Thomas|2009|pp=155\u2013156}} and as the best-known example of [[military science fiction]].{{sfn|Booker|Thomas|2009|pp=102}} It was also a personal landmark for Heinlein; it was one of his best-selling books, and is his best-known novel.<ref name=\"Mcmilllan\"/> The novel has been described as marking Heinlein's transition from writing juvenile fiction to a \"more mature phase\" as an author.<ref name=\"Hubble\"/> Reviewing the book with others written for children, [[Floyd C.
