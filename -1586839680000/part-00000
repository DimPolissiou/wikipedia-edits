Like other [[Magic item|magical object]]s in stories, magic rings can act as a [[plot device]], but in two distinct ways. They may give magical abilities to a person who is otherwise lacking in them, or enhance the power of a [[wizard (fantasy)|wizard]]. Or alternatively, they may function as nothing more than [[MacGuffin]]s, that is, objects for which it is the characters' desire to obtain them, rather than any innate power that they possess, that moves the story along. [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]'s ''[[The Hobbit]]'', for example, involves a magical ring which allows [[Bilbo Baggins]] to be instrumental in a quest, matching the abilities of the dwarves.<ref>{{cite book |first=Tom |last=Shippey |title=The Road to Middle-earth |page=77 |ISBN=0-618-25760-8}}</ref> In the ''Volsunga Saga'', on the other hand, the magic ring that [[Sigurd]] takes from the dragon Fafnir is a symbolic item, cursed by the dwarf [[Andvari]] from whom it was stolen by [[Loki]]; the ring is a plot device that creates a sense of inevitable disaster as the story unfolds.<ref>{{cite book |author=Byock, Jesse L. |orig-year=1990 |edition=reprint |year=1999 |title=The Saga of the Volsungs: the Norse Epic of Sugurd the Dragon Slayer |quote=Translated from Old Norse with an introduction. |publisher=Penguin Books Limited}}</ref>\n\n===''The Ring of the Nibelungens''===\n[[File:Wagner - G\u00f6tterd\u00e4mmerung - If you threaten my life, hardly you'll win from my hand the ring - Ferdinand Leeke - The Victrola book of the opera.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[G\u00f6tterd\u00e4mmerung]] tells the Rhinemaidens: \"If you threaten my life, hardly you'll win from my hand the ring\".]]\nThe composer [[Richard Wagner]] wrote a series of four [[opera]]s titled ''[[Der Ring des Nibelungen]]'' which present his version of the story told in ''The Nibelungenlied'' and in ''Volsunga Saga'', as well as the [[Prose Edda]].

Tolkien]]'s fantasy novel ''The Hobbit'' was written as children's fiction, but as the story grew into ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' the matter expanded, borrowing from Germanic and Norse mythology for many of its themes, creatures, and names. Of twenty magical Rings of Power, four are described in some detail: The extremely powerful and dangerous \"[[One Ring]]\" around which the plot revolves; and three rings worn by [[Gandalf]] the wizard and the elves [[Elrond]] and [[Galadriel]].\n\nSeven Rings of Power were given to the dwarves in an only slightly successful attempt to corrupt them. Humans prove to be more susceptible; each of the nine Nazg\u00fbl were once great lords of men who were turned to terrifying wraiths and servants of the Dark Lord [[Sauron]] by their respective rings. The sixteen rings ultimately given to dwarves and men were created in a joint effort by the elves and Sauron. The three rings kept by the elves were forged by the elves alone, and Sauron had no direct hand in their creation. Sauron forged the One Ring in secret, with the intention that it would be a \"master ring\" and give him control over all the other rings, but was not completely successful in this aim. \n\nOnly the One Ring makes any appearance in ''The Hobbit'', and then it is only known as a magic ring which makes the wearer invisible; its much larger and darker significance is not revealed until ''The Lord of the Rings''. The history of the Rings of Power is described in its known entirety in ''[[The Silmarillion]]'', in \"Of the Rings of Power and the Third Age\".\n\n===''The Rose and the Ring''===\n[[William Makepeace Thackeray]]'s satirical novel ''[[The Rose and the Ring]]'' features a ring that has the power to make whoever owns it beautiful; its passage from person to person in the novel is an important element of the story.<ref>{{cite book |first=Stephen |last=Prickett |title=Victorian Fantasy |page=69 |ISBN=0-253-17461-9}}</ref>\n\n===''The Chronicles of Narnia''===\nIn ''[[The Magician's Nephew]]'', from [[C.S.

Rings endowed with special properties were significant in pagan Scandinavia.

The ring was placed onto [[Baldr]]'s funeral pyre, but Baldr gave Draupnir back to [[Herm\u00f3\u00f0r|Hermodr]] and so the ring was returned to Odin from the land of death.<ref>Byock, Jesse L, 2005.

Like other [[Magic item|magical object]]s in stories, magic rings can act as a [[plot device]], but in two distinct ways. They may give magical abilities to a person who is otherwise lacking in them, or enhance the power of a [[wizard (fantasy)|wizard]]. Or alternatively, they may function as nothing more than [[MacGuffin]]s, that is, objects for which it is the characters' desire to obtain them, rather than any innate power that they possess, that moves the story along. [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]'s ''[[The Hobbit]]'', for example, involves a magical ring which allows [[Bilbo Baggins]] to be instrumental in a quest, matching the abilities of the dwarves.<ref>{{cite book |first=Tom |last=Shippey |title=The Road to Middle-earth |page=77 |ISBN=0-618-25760-8}}</ref> In the ''Volsunga Saga'', on the other hand, the magic ring that [[Sigurd]] takes from the dragon Fafnir is a symbolic item, cursed by the dwarf [[Andvari]] from whom it was stolen by [[Loki]]; the ring is a plot device that creates a sense of inevitable disaster as the story unfolds.<ref>{{cite book |author=Byock, Jesse L. |orig-year=1990 |edition=reprint |year=1999 |title=The Saga of the Volsungs: the Norse Epic of Sugurd the Dragon Slayer |quote=Translated from Old Norse with an introduction. |publisher=Penguin Books Limited}}</ref>\n\n===''The Ring of the Nibelungens''===\n[[File:Wagner - G\u00f6tterd\u00e4mmerung - If you threaten my life, hardly you'll win from my hand the ring - Ferdinand Leeke - The Victrola book of the opera.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[G\u00f6tterd\u00e4mmerung]] tells the Rhinemaidens: \"If you threaten my life, hardly you'll win from my hand the ring\".]]\nThe composer [[Richard Wagner]] wrote a series of four [[opera]]s titled ''[[Der Ring des Nibelungen]]'' which present his version of the story told in ''The Nibelungenlied'' and in ''Volsunga Saga'', as well as the [[Prose Edda]].

Tolkien]]'s fantasy novel ''The Hobbit'' was written as children's fiction, but as the story grew into ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' the matter expanded, borrowing from Germanic and Norse mythology for many of its themes, creatures, and names. Of twenty magical Rings of Power, four are described in some detail: The extremely powerful and dangerous \"[[One Ring]]\" around which the plot revolves; and three rings worn by [[Gandalf]] the wizard and the elves [[Elrond]] and [[Galadriel]].\n\nSeven Rings of Power were given to the dwarves in an only slightly successful attempt to corrupt them. Humans prove to be more susceptible; each of the nine Nazg\u00fbl were once great lords of men who were turned to terrifying wraiths and servants of the Dark Lord [[Sauron]] by their respective rings. The sixteen rings ultimately given to dwarves and men were created in a joint effort by the elves and Sauron. The three rings kept by the elves were forged by the elves alone, and Sauron had no direct hand in their creation. Sauron forged the One Ring in secret, with the intention that it would be a \"master ring\" and give him control over all the other rings, but was not completely successful in this aim. \n\nOnly the One Ring makes any appearance in ''The Hobbit'', and then it is only known as a magic ring which makes the wearer invisible; its much larger and darker significance is not revealed until ''The Lord of the Rings''. The history of the Rings of Power is described in its known entirety in ''[[The Silmarillion]]'', in \"Of the Rings of Power and the Third Age\".\n\n===''The Rose and the Ring''===\n[[William Makepeace Thackeray]]'s satirical novel ''[[The Rose and the Ring]]'' features a ring that has the power to make whoever owns it beautiful; its passage from person to person in the novel is an important element of the story.<ref>{{cite book |first=Stephen |last=Prickett |title=Victorian Fantasy |page=69 |ISBN=0-253-17461-9}}</ref>\n\n===''The Chronicles of Narnia''===\nIn ''[[The Magician's Nephew]]'', from [[C.S. Lewis]]' ''[[The Chronicles of Narnia]]'' series, two magic rings, which take people to the [[Wood between the Worlds]], a linking room between [[Parallel universe (fiction)|parallel universe]]s, are central to the story; a yellow ring, when touched, sends a person to the Wood Between the Worlds, while a green ring is used from there to bring that person into a world of their choosing. These rings were created by the magician \"Uncle Andrew\" by the use of magical dust from Atlantis.\n\n===Harry Potter series===\nThe ''[[Harry Potter]]'' series, by author [[J. K. Rowling]], features a [[Magical objects in Harry Potter#Marvolo Gaunt's Ring|magic ring]] bearing a coat of arms linked to the [[Peverell brothers]], [[Harry Potter (character)|Harry Potter]] and [[Lord Voldemort]]'s ancestors. It becomes one of the most important objects in Harry Potter's world because it contains a fragment of Voldemort's soul and formerly held one of the three [[Deathly Hallows (objects)|Deathly Hallows]]: the Resurrection Stone which can summon the deceased.\n\n===''Doctor Who'' first series===\nIn the longest-running science-fiction series ''[[Doctor Who]]'', the [[First Doctor]] sometimes used a ring with strange powers, which first appeared in [[The Web Planet]] where he used it to control a Zarbi. In ''Doctor Who''{{'}}s 20th&nbsp;anniversary story ''[[The Five Doctors]]'' the ring of Rassilon, the legendary founder of Time Lord society, is said to confer immortality. Apparently this is how [[Rassilon]] has remained alive. However, when the renegade Time Lord [[Borusa]] puts the ring on he is turned to stone, as were others before him. This was a trap by Rassilon for renegade Time Lords.\n\n===Others===\n* In [[Andre Norton]]'s novel ''The Zero Stone'', the title comes from a ring that has advanced properties. \n* [[H.

These rings allow the bearer to perform any feat he can imagine, but are limited by his willpower. The ''Blackest Night'' story line reveals the existence of similar rings of other colors, powered by other emotions such as greed and hope. The original [[Green Lantern]], [[Alan Scott]] fashions a power ring from an ancient lamp that is a concentration of magic energy that the [[Guardians of the Universe]] created in an attempt to remove magic from the universe. As a result of this discovery, Scott's ring functions much like the standard Green Lantern rings, except that it cannot directly affect wood.\n* In the [[Marvel Universe]], [[Iron Man]]'s nemesis [[Mandarin (comics) #Powers and abilities|The Mandarin]] has ten magical rings retrieved from an [[ancient alien]] spacecraft.

The award is available for [[editing|editors]] of [[magazine]]s, novels, anthologies, or other works related to science fiction or fantasy. The award supplanted a previous award for [[Hugo Award for Best Professional Magazine|professional magazine]]. The Hugo Awards have been described as \"a fine showcase for speculative fiction\" and \"the best known literary award for science fiction writing\".<ref name=\"GuardianHugo\"/><ref name=\"LitroHugo\"/>\n\nThe award was first presented in 1973, and was given annually through 2006. Beginning in 2007, the award was split into two categories, that of Best Editor (Short Form) and Best Editor (Long Form). The Short Form award is for editors of anthologies, collections or magazines, while the Long Form award is for editors of novels. In addition to the regular Hugo awards, beginning in 1996 Retrospective Hugo Awards, or \"Retro Hugos\", have been available to be awarded for years 50, 75, or 100 years prior in which no awards were given.<ref name=\"thafaq\"/> To date, Retro Hugo awards have been awarded for 1939, 1941, 1943, 1946, 1951, and 1954, and in each case an award for professional editor was given.<ref name=\"LocusRetroHugoinfo\"/>\n\nDuring the 56 nomination years, 73 editors have been nominated for the original Best Professional Editor, the Short Form, or the Long Form award, including Retro Hugos. Of these, [[Gardner Dozois]] has received the most awards, with 15 original awards out of 19 nominations for the original category and 1 out of 2 for the Short Form. The only other editors to win more than three awards are [[Ben Bova]], who won 6 of 8 nominations for the original award, [[Ellen Datlow]], who won 7 of 17 nominations, split between the original and short form awards, and [[John W. Campbell|John W. Campbell, Jr.]] with 7 out of 7 nominations for the Retro Hugo awards. The two editors who have won three times are [[Edward L. Ferman]] with 3 out of 20 original nominations and [[Patrick Nielsen Hayden]] with 3 out of 3 Long Form nominations. [[Stanley Schmidt]] has received the most nominations, at 27 original and 7 Short Form, winning one Short Form.\n\n==Selection==\nHugo Award nominees and winners are chosen by supporting or attending members of the annual [[Worldcon|World Science Fiction Convention]], or Worldcon, and the presentation evening constitutes its central event. The selection process is defined in the World Science Fiction Society Constitution as [[instant-runoff voting]] with six nominees, except in the case of a tie. The works on the ballot are the six most-nominated by members that year, with no limit on the number of works that can be nominated.<ref name=\"thafaq\"/> Initial nominations are made by members in January through March, while voting on the ballot of six nominations is performed roughly in April through July, subject to change depending on when that year's Worldcon is held.<ref name=\"thaabout\"/> Prior to 2017, the final ballot was five works; it was changed that year to six, with each initial nominator limited to five nominations.<ref name=\"2017change\"/> Worldcons are generally held near [[Labor Day]], and are held in a different city around the world each year.<ref name=\"LocusHugoinfo\"/><ref name=\"worldcon\"/> Members are permitted to vote \"no award\", if they feel that none of the nominees is deserving of the award that year, and in the case that \"no award\" takes the majority the Hugo is not given in that category. This happened in both the Short Form and Long Form categories in 2015.<ref name=\"Hugo15\"/>\n\n== Winners and nominees ==\nIn the following tables, the years correspond to the date of the ceremony. Editors are eligible based on their work of the previous calendar year, and each date links to the \"year in literature\" article corresponding with when those works were eligible. Although the Best Professional Editor award is not given explicitly for any particular editing effort and such works are not recorded by the World Science Fiction Society, works that the editor in question was involved with in the eligibility period are listed. This list includes magazines or [[anthology|anthologies]] that the editor worked on and publishing houses that he or she was employed at, and is not intended to be comprehensive. Entries with a blue background and an asterisk (*) next to the editor's name have won the award; those with a white background are the nominees on the short-list.\n\n===Best Professional

The award is available for [[editing|editors]] of [[magazine]]s, novels, anthologies, or other works related to science fiction or fantasy. The award supplanted a previous award for [[Hugo Award for Best Professional Magazine|professional magazine]]. The Hugo Awards have been described as \"a fine showcase for speculative fiction\" and \"the best known literary award for science fiction writing\".<ref name=\"GuardianHugo\"/><ref name=\"LitroHugo\"/>\n\nThe award was first presented in 1973, and was given annually through 2006. Beginning in 2007, the award was split into two categories, that of Best Editor (Short Form) and Best Editor (Long Form). The Short Form award is for editors of anthologies, collections or magazines, while the Long Form award is for editors of novels. In addition to the regular Hugo awards, beginning in 1996 Retrospective Hugo Awards, or \"Retro Hugos\", have been available to be awarded for years 50, 75, or 100 years prior in which no awards were given.<ref name=\"thafaq\"/> To date, Retro Hugo awards have been awarded for 1939, 1941, 1943, 1946, 1951, and 1954, and in each case an award for professional editor was given.<ref name=\"LocusRetroHugoinfo\"/>\n\nDuring the 56 nomination years, 73 editors have been nominated for the original Best Professional Editor, the Short Form, or the Long Form award, including Retro Hugos. Of these, [[Gardner Dozois]] has received the most awards, with 15 original awards out of 19 nominations for the original category and 1 out of 2 for the Short Form. The only other editors to win more than three awards are [[Ben Bova]], who won 6 of 8 nominations for the original award, [[Ellen Datlow]], who won 7 of 17 nominations, split between the original and short form awards, and [[John W. Campbell|John W. Campbell, Jr.]] with 7 out of 7 nominations for the Retro Hugo awards. The two editors who have won three times are [[Edward L. Ferman]] with 3 out of 20 original nominations and [[Patrick Nielsen Hayden]] with 3 out of 3 Long Form nominations. [[Stanley Schmidt]] has received the most nominations, at 27 original and 7 Short Form, winning one Short Form.\n\n==Selection==\nHugo Award nominees and winners are chosen by supporting or attending members of the annual [[Worldcon|World Science Fiction Convention]], or Worldcon, and the presentation evening constitutes its central event. The selection process is defined in the World Science Fiction Society Constitution as [[instant-runoff voting]] with six nominees, except in the case of a tie. The works on the ballot are the six most-nominated by members that year, with no limit on the number of works that can be nominated.<ref name=\"thafaq\"/> Initial nominations are made by members in January through March, while voting on the ballot of six nominations is performed roughly in April through July, subject to change depending on when that year's Worldcon is held.<ref name=\"thaabout\"/> Prior to 2017, the final ballot was five works; it was changed that year to six, with each initial nominator limited to five nominations.<ref name=\"2017change\"/> Worldcons are generally held near [[Labor Day]], and are held in a different city around the world each year.<ref name=\"LocusHugoinfo\"/><ref name=\"worldcon\"/> Members are permitted to vote \"no award\", if they feel that none of the nominees is deserving of the award that year, and in the case that \"no award\" takes the majority the Hugo is not given in that category. This happened in both the Short Form and Long Form categories in 2015.<ref name=\"Hugo15\"/>\n\n== Winners and nominees ==\nIn the following tables, the years correspond to the date of the ceremony. Editors are eligible based on their work of the previous calendar year, and each date links to the \"year in literature\" article corresponding with when those works were eligible. Although the Best Professional Editor award is not given explicitly for any particular editing effort and such works are not recorded by the World Science Fiction Society, works that the editor in question was involved with in the eligibility period are listed. This list includes magazines or [[anthology|anthologies]] that the editor worked on and publishing houses that he or she was employed at, and is not intended to be comprehensive. Entries with a blue background and an asterisk (*) next to the editor's name have won the award; those with a white background are the nominees on the short-list.\n\n===Best Professional
