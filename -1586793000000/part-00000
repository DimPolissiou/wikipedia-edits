One improvement in this game is the appearance of six-man tag team matches, as well as six-man and eight-man battle royals (elimination matches; the latter being the only game in the series until the release of ''[[WWE 2K18]]''). Additionally, this was the first game of the series to give each wrestler two finishing moves, as well as the first to allow editing of the in-game wrestlers' move sets. ''Just Bring It'' was also the first game in the series to feature authentic, complete ring entrances. The game features several venues from 2000 and 2001, including the arena for ''[[WWE Raw|Raw Is War]]'' and both the original and new arenas for ''[[WWE SmackDown|SmackDown!]]'' (Ovaltron and the Fist stages).\n\nThe game's roster was criticised at the time for being outdated, as it was finalised very early in WWF's Invasion angle and prior to the emergence of several former ECW and WCW wrestlers. Whilst [[William Regal]], [[Raven (wrestler)|Raven]], [[Rhyno]], [[Tajiri (wrestler)|Tajiri]], [[Spike Dudley]], [[Jerry Lynn]] and [[Molly Holly]] were new additions to the game, several stars who had become more prominent, such as [[Rob Van Dam]], [[Booker T (wrestler)|Booker T]], [[Diamond Dallas Page]], [[Ric Flair]], [[Lance Storm]] and [[Mike Awesome]] were not. In addition to these, Limp Bizkit vocalist [[Fred Durst]] appears in the game as a condition of allowing \"[[Rollin' (Limp Bizkit song)|Rollin']] \" to be included as [[The Undertaker]]'s then-theme music (it is one of his only two game appearances, as he also appears in ''[[WWF Raw (2002 video game)|WWF Raw]]'' for the XBox). This is the only WWF game in which Jerry Lynn appears - he would be gone from the company within five months of its release.\n\n===Game modes===\nRather than the Season Modes presented in the previous ''SmackDown!'' games, ''Just Bring It'' has a Story Mode.
