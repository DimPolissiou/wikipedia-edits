After ''StarStruck'', she appeared in ''[[Love to Love (TV series)|Love to Love]]'' and ''[[Fantastikids]]'' and then later starred in ''[[Fantastic Man]]''.

They meet a group of village girls who tell them the story of Unai. In the story, two men, Sasada and Chinu, declare their love for Unai. Unwilling to incur the jealousy of one by favouring the other, Unai declined to make a choice. Her parents make the two suitors compete for her hand, but each contest results in a draw. In torment, Unai drowns herself in Ikuta River. After her funeral, Sasada and Chinu were inconsolable, and they commit suicide by stabbing each other to death. Unai's ghost bears the karmic responsibility for their demise. The priest intones prayers for her soul. She hears the prayers, but they are of no avail; she is unable to escape from the [[Upaya#Parable of the burning house|Burning House]] (a Buddhist metaphor for the secular world) and the [[The Eight Cold Hells|Eight Great Hells]], through which she is eternally tormented by her demons. In another version of the story, Unai is depicted as being pulled in different directions by the deceased lovers in a metaphorical tug of war. There is a clear allusion to Y\u016bko's relationship with Ippei and K\u014dji. The [[love triangle]] between Unai, Sasada, and Chinu corresponds to that of ''The Frolic of the Beasts'' with Y\u016bko, Ippei, and K\u014dji, as well as in Kiyoshi's and Matsukichi's quarrel over Kimi's love.<ref name=\"Translator's Note\"/> It is interesting to note that in the traditional Noh theatre, immorality was always regarded as a sin which would lead to eternal damnation in the fires of hell (echoing Unai's fate in ''Motomezuka'' and Y\u016bko's anguish in prison).\n\nThe name ''Motomezuka'' is likely to be a corruption of Otomezuka (the \"Maiden's Grave\"), the original story being contained in an episode of the Yamato Monogatari, a tale combining narrative fiction with waka poetry from he mid-tenth century. The earliest references to the story appear in poem form in the Many\u014dsh\u016b, the oldest and greatest anthology of Japanese poems, compiled during the late Nara period.\n\nNoh theatre performances are characterised by their use of meticulously designed masks that represent specific characters and facial expressions. N\u014d masks are referenced throughout ''The Frolic of the Beasts''.<ref name=\"Translator's Note\"/> At the beginning of the novel's first chapter, K\u014dji humours himself with the thought that his own face \"is like a well-crafted, carved wooden mask.\"<ref>{{cite book|author=Yukio Mishima|title=The Frolic of the Beasts|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dMguDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT14|date=27 November 2018|publisher=Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-525-43416-0|page=14}}</ref><ref name=\"Translator's Note\"/> In the novel's prologue, Ippei's expression is described as an \"interminable smile\", which recalls the fixed expression of N\u014d masks.<ref>{{cite book|author=Yukio Mishima|title=The Frolic of the Beasts|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Wi17DwAAQBAJ&pg=PA6|year=2018|publisher=Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-525-43415-3|page=6}}</ref><ref name=\"Translator's Note\"/><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://lithub.com/the-frolic-of-the-beasts/ |title=The Frolic of the Beasts |date=28 November 2018 |website=[[Literary Hub]] |accessdate=11 March 2020}}</ref> Also, the \"dark grape luster\" of Y\u016bko's \"characteristic thick lipstick\" is likely a direct reference to the archetypal \"young woman\" (Wakaonna) character portrayed in Noh productions.<ref name=\"Translator's Note\"/><ref>{{cite book|author=Yukio Mishima|title=The Frolic of the Beasts|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dMguDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT20|date=27 November 2018|publisher=Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-525-43416-0|page=20}}</ref> In his review for ''[[The Japan Times]]'', Damian Flanagan also compared the \"jumbled\" nature of the novel's nonlinear narrative as creating a \"transcendent unearthliness\" similar to that of a Noh play.<ref name=\"The Japan Times\"/>\n\nMiyoko Tanaka, the commentator in the original Shinchosha paperback edition of the novel says that both in the form of the story, which is \"like a dream rising from weed-infested ruins,\" and from the descriptions of the faces of the characters, \"we Japanese clearly recognize vestiges of the traditional Noh theater performance.\"\n\nMishima was infatuated with the Noh theater and he wrote several Noh plays himself (adapted from ancient Noh performances). All of his plays were performed in Japan and some of them in other cities around the world, including New York. There is some speculation that Mishima was partly influenced in his choice of subject matter by the theme of Noh masks running through [[Fumiko Enchi]]'s novel, ''[[Masks (novel)|Masks]]''. It seems certain that Mishima rated Enchi highly and described this book as an \"esoteric masterpiece.\" Enchi's novel was published in 1958, three years before ''The Frolic of the Beasts''.\n\n==Plot==\n===Prologue===\nIn a photograph, three smiling individuals\u2013Ippei Kusakado, his wife Y\u016bko, and the youthful K\u014dji\u2013are seen standing on the harbor wall in Iro Village, a rural fishing port in the western part of the [[Izu Peninsula]] in [[Shizuoka Prefecture]]. The photograph was taken on a hot summer day. It was taken only days before \"the final wretched incident\". It was immediately sent to the chief priest of Taisenji temple. In Iro, there are also rice paddies as well as the Kusakado greenhouses, located beside the Kusakado family home. On the mountainside lies a new graveyard, reaching halfway up the slope of the mountain from its base. In spite of opposition from the villagers, the chief priest of Taisenji temple erected the new graves with the money that was entrusted to him. Ippei's grave lies on the right, K\u014dji's on the left, and Y\u016bko's in the center. Y\u016bko's, however, is only a \"living monument\", reserved for her eventual death.\n\n===Chapter 1===\n[[File:Nishiizu 20121019.jpg|thumb|Izu coastline in Nishiizu.]]\nK\u014dji is released from prison. He travels by boat from [[Numazu]] to Iro Village, where Y\u016bko is waiting for him. K\u014dji tells himself that he has repented and is a different person, but once he arrives he is immediately told by Y\u016bko that he hasn't changed. Y\u016bko had become his guarantor upon his release, but they both question whether they have made a mistake in K\u014dji coming to Iro. Y\u016bko closed the Tokyo shop a year ago, moved to Iro, and started the Kusakado greenhouse, which K\u014dji will work in. The two of them walk through Iro to the Kusakado house. Greeted by villagers on the way, K\u014dji is ashamed knowing rumours of his past will spread but Y\u016bko tells him to keep his head up. K\u014dji is seized by fear when he sees Ippei in front of the gate of the house.\n\n===Chapter 2===\nTwo years earlier, when he was a 21-year-old university student, K\u014dji was hired to work at a Western ceramics shop in Ginza, Tokyo. Ippei Kusakado, a 40-year-old man, is the owner and manager of the ceramics shop but also translates and reviews German literature in his spare time. While drinking together at a bar, Ippei tells K\u014dji about his unhappiness with his wife Y\u016bko's lack of jealousy. He says he has tried everything to make her jealous, confessing to his numerous affairs. K\u014dji, jealous of Ippei's \"corrupt heart\", falls in love with Y\u016bko that night, despite not having met her before. K\u014dji begins a secret affair with Y\u016bko. One night, Y\u016bko told K\u014dji that she knows Ippei has been adulterous, showing him documentation from a private investigator who tracked his infidelity. She cried, but told K\u014dji not to tell her husband of her suffering. On a summer's day, six months after he first met Y\u016bko, K\u014dji is waiting for Y\u016bko outside a hospital. He spots a black wrench laying on the ground and puts it in his jacket pocket. Much later while in prison, K\u014dji reflected on the wrench, viewing it as a manifestation of \"[[Will (philosophy)|will]]\" that had become a material phenomen which sought to \"upset the very foundations\" of the order of his world. That evening, Y\u016bko and K\u014dji walk in on Ippei and find him with a lover, Machiko. Y\u016bko simply asks Ippei to \"return home quietly\". K\u014dji expected a grand confrontation, where \"the truth of\nperverse human nature begins to shine\". He instead sees it as \"nothing other than things he had grown utterly tired of seeing: the mediocre concealment of human shame, the irony of keeping up appearances.\" Y\u016bko, crying and jabbering, is struck across the cheek twice by Ippei. K\u014dji immediately reacts without \"emotion, objective, or motive\", and repeatedly bashes the left side of Ippei's head with the wrench he had placed in the pocket of his jacket.\n\n===Chapter 3===\nIn Iro, K\u014dji meets Ippei for the first time since he was imprisoned. K\u014dji's assault leaves Ippei with a fractured cranium and a cerebral contusion. Ippei is diagnosed with [[aphasia]] and [[Hemiplegia|paralysis on his right side]], and is left with an \"interminable smile\". K\u014dji explains his assault as driven by an extreme unease with enduring that \"world bereft of logic\", and chose to impart the \"cold, hard, black logic of iron\" of the wrench. K\u014dji works in the Kusakado greenhouse with fellow gardener Teijiro. One day, K\u014dji, Y\u016bko and Ippei go for a picnic at the nearby waterfall and greet Kakujin, the priest of Taisenji temple, on the way. They stop at the village shrine to make a peace offering with a lily, but Y\u016bko is unimpressed with the shrine's appearance and size. Y\u016bko's sacrilege scares K\u014dji. Y\u016bko suddenly begins to taunt Ippei, asking him if he understands \"sacrifice\". Ippei replies that he does not understand and K\u014dji tries to defend him but Y\u016bko cuts K\u014dji off and calls Ippei an idiot. Y\u016bko throws the lily into the plunge pool, and Ippei's face displays \"a look of pure anxiety born of being cut off from all understanding\". She asks Ippei if he understands the word \"kiss\", then passionately kisses K\u014dji in front of him. K\u014dji scolds Y\u016bko for using him for Ippei's sake. She answers, asserting she has used K\u014dji from the beginning and that he surely likes it. K\u014dji strikes Y\u016bko across the cheek and turns to Ippei, who has a fixed smile on his face. Terrified, K\u014dji embraces Y\u016bko to erase the fear from his mind, but her kiss \"had lost completely its exquisite taste\".\n\n===Chapter 4===\nOne evening, K\u014dji is drinking alone at the Storm Petrel, the only bar in Iro Village. He gossips with the bar's owner about Teijir\u014d's young daughter, Kimi. K\u014dji has never heard Teijir\u014d speak about Kimi, and senses that there are ill feelings between them. After Kimi's mother died, they had lived together until Kimi suddenly left for Hamamatsu to become a factory girl. Kimi has not interacted with Teijir\u014d since returning to Iro for a ten-day vacation from her work at the Imperial Instruments factory in Hamamatsu. Kimi is strikingly beautiful and makes the village girls of Iro jealous by her presence. She carries a ukulele with her wherever she goes. At around 9:00 p.m., Kimi, Matsukichi, and Kiyoshi enter the bar and K\u014dji joins them at their table. Matsukichi is a fisherman and Kiyoshi is a member of the Japan Air Self-Defense Force ground crew. They are both Kimi's childhood friends, and have quarrelled with each other over her love ever since. K\u014dji envies Kiyoshi's \"simple lyrical spirit\", but considers Matsukichi \"a dull-witted young animal\". Looking at the three characters, K\u014dji thinks of Y\u016bko, who has not permitted him to kiss her since the incident during the picnic. He realises the depth of his love for Y\u016bko and repeats \"I have repented\" to himself. Together in the bar, K\u014dji, Kimi, Matsukichi, and Kiyoshi all get drunk and Kimi offers up her ukulele, swearing that whichever of the young men gets it will be the one who gets her love. Interested, they all leave in a small boat and travel to Urayasu where they go nude swimming. They walk into Urayasu forest and start a bonfire, where Kimi refuses to give up her ukulele. Matsukichi steals the instrument from Kimi, then passes it to Kiyoshi. The two men pass it back and forth to each other as Kimi attempts to take it back. Matsukichi and Kiyoshi take the ukulele and jump into the boat together, rowing into the bay by themselves. K\u014dji and Kimi return to the forest bonfire. Kimi says she purposely did not swim after the boat because she wished be alone with K\u014dji. Kimi says she respects K\u014dji's love for Y\u016bko, but is \"prepared to make a sacrifice and act as a stand-in\". K\u014dji and Kimi have sex, but K\u014dji cannot suppress the thought that the experience is \"nothing but a poor imitation\" of the \"perfect flesh\" that he created and refined with his imagination while in prison. They swim across the bay and return home. Several days later, K\u014dji hears rumours that Kiyoshi kept the ukulele, carrying it around wherever he went to the envy of the other young men in the village. That night, after drinking at the bar, Matsukichi confesses to K\u014dji that he and Kiyoshi made a secret pact. Kiyoshi only cared about his reputation, and agreed to never lay a hand on Kimi. The night after they went to Urayasu, Kimi gave herself to Matsukichi. When Matsukichi told Kimi of their pact, she laughed but accepted his proposal nonetheless. K\u014dji is surprised that Matsukichi has no inkling that he and Kimi had sex while alone on the island together.\n\n===Chapter 5===\nWhile working in the greenhouse, Teijir\u014d suddenly confesses to K\u014dji that he raped Kimi. Teijir\u014d then shows K\u014dji a pornographic photograph of a boy in a student's uniform having sex with a girl in a sailor uniform, and remarks that the girl has a similar appearance to that of Kimi. K\u014dji is disturbed by Teijir\u014d's unsolicited confession, and questions what the purpose of his confession was. Kimi stops by the Kusakado house to say goodbye before leaving to return to the factory in Hamamatsu. Looking at her, K\u014dji theorises that Kimi had slept with him and persuaded Matsukichi to love her only in order to infect them with the \"germ-like secret of her father's crime\" without letting them know her truth. He imagines she was quitely picturing \"the origin of her burning, rejuvenating humiliation and self-loathing\" while they had sex. Kimi says goodbye and squeezes K\u014dji's hands, gazing in his eyes. K\u014dji stares only at Y\u016bko, who takes out a hairpin from her hair and pricks the back of Kimi's hand. Kimi leaves, running down the slope laughing maniacally, while Y\u016bko turns away with a frown on her face. In the heat of that night, K\u014dji is lying on his bed while covered by a mosquito net. Y\u016bko enters K\u014dji's room and tells him she stuck her hairpin in the hand of the \"conceited\" Kimi to warn her, not out of jealously. Y\u016bko compares her action to that of K\u014dji with the wrench, and reveals that she is jealous of Koji's crime. She is jealous of \"not having a crime to her name\" that would allow her to at least \"stand beside him\". K\u014dji and Y\u016bko passionately embrace between the mosquito net, but Y\u016bko sees a figure outside and loudly screams that her husband is approaching. K\u014dji realises Y\u016bko wishes to be caught by Ippei, that it would liberate her from her \"long-continued suffering\". He is infuriated by Y\u016bko and refuses to let her through the mosquito net, not wanting to be caught by Ippei in an adulterous position with Y\u016bko. Ippei climbs the stairs and tells Y\u016bko he wants to sleep there because it is cool. Several days later, after a typhoon passes and misses West Izu, K\u014dji speaks with Kakujin the priest at Taisenji temple. He sees Y\u016bko and Ippei coming down the slope, and Y\u016bko asks K\u014dji to accompany Ippei on his daily walk. K\u014dji decides to confront Ippei on their walk, vehemently questioning him and accusing him of elaborately tormenting Y\u016bko and him under the guise of his mental incapacity. He calls him a \"hollow cavern\" and \"empty hole\" which the household revolves around. K\u014dji asks Ippei what he wants, to which Ippei responds he wishes to go home. K\u014dji is angered by this \"childlike supplication\" and further presses Ippei, asking him what he really wants. Ippei responds, \"Death. I want to die.\" They meet back up with Y\u016bko, and K\u014dji tells her that he feels his life is being lived solely for Ippei's sake. There is a tacit understanding between them, and Y\u016bko says, \"There's no going back now after all of this.\" The three of them arrive at the harbor, and Y\u016bko says they should travel to the other side of the bay one day. She suggests Teijir\u014d take them over in the boat in the middle of the day and that they should take \"lots of pictures\".\n\n===Epilogue===\nOn a summer vacation, a folklore researcher travels to Iro and speaks with a priest, Kakujin, who recounts his memories of Ippei, Y\u016bko, and K\u014dji. Kakujin tells of the time Y\u016bko and K\u014dji appeared at Taisenji temple, confessing to strangling Ippei to death. Kakujin shows the researcher the photo described in the novel's prologue. It had been given to him the day before Ippei was murdered. K\u014dji testified that he murdered Ippei at Ippei's request, but K\u014dji's gifting of the photograph to the priest was used as indelible evidence of [[Malice aforethought|premeditated]] murder. K\u014dji was given the death penalty, and Y\u016bko was sentenced to life imprisonment. While in prison, Y\u016bko requested Kakujin to arrange their graves side by side, with Y\u016bko in between. The researcher visits the graves, and takes a photograph. The priest asks the researcher to deliver the photograph on his behalf to Y\u016bko in person. The researcher later travels to Tochigi prison and meets Y\u016bko. Looking at the photograph, she thanks the researcher and says, \"Now I can serve my time in peace.\" Y\u016bko puts the photograph in her pocket and leaves.\n\n==Setting==\n[[File:Westcoast@izu - panoramio (1).jpg|thumb|270px|The harbor in Tago, [[Nishiizu]], just south of present-day Arari.]]\n\"Iro Village\" is a fictional place set in the former fishing village of [[:ja:\u5b89\u826f\u91cc\u6751|Arari]], which was merged into the current town of [[Nishiizu]].

However, nearby Arari is a real mountain called \"Ono-san\" or \"Ono-yama.\" The Japanese characters \"Ono\" can also be read \"Taiya.\" Mishima stayed at a [[Ryokan (inn)|ryokan]] in Arari and also visited the Air Self Defense Force base at nearby Hamamatsu while writing ''The Frolic of the Beasts'' (Mishima is known to have been assiduous with his on-site research).

They meet a group of village girls who tell them the story of Unai. In the story, two men, Sasada and Chinu, declare their love for Unai. Unwilling to incur the jealousy of one by favouring the other, Unai declined to make a choice. Her parents make the two suitors compete for her hand, but each contest results in a draw. In torment, Unai drowns herself in Ikuta River. After her funeral, Sasada and Chinu were inconsolable, and they commit suicide by stabbing each other to death. Unai's ghost bears the karmic responsibility for their demise. The priest intones prayers for her soul. She hears the prayers, but they are of no avail; she is unable to escape from the [[Upaya#Parable of the burning house|Burning House]] (a Buddhist metaphor for the secular world) and the [[The Eight Cold Hells|Eight Great Hells]], through which she is eternally tormented by her demons. In another version of the story, Unai is depicted as being pulled in different directions by the deceased lovers in a metaphorical tug of war. There is a clear allusion to Y\u016bko's relationship with Ippei and K\u014dji. The [[love triangle]] between Unai, Sasada, and Chinu corresponds to that of ''The Frolic of the Beasts'' with Y\u016bko, Ippei, and K\u014dji, as well as in Kiyoshi's and Matsukichi's quarrel over Kimi's love.<ref name=\"Translator's Note\"/> It is interesting to note that in the traditional Noh theatre, immorality was always regarded as a sin which would lead to eternal damnation in the fires of hell (echoing Unai's fate in ''Motomezuka'' and Y\u016bko's anguish in prison).\n\nThe name ''Motomezuka'' is likely to be a corruption of Otomezuka (the \"Maiden's Grave\"), the original story being contained in an episode of the Yamato Monogatari, a tale combining narrative fiction with waka poetry from he mid-tenth century. The earliest references to the story appear in poem form in the Many\u014dsh\u016b, the oldest and greatest anthology of Japanese poems, compiled during the late Nara period.\n\nNoh theatre performances are characterised by their use of meticulously designed masks that represent specific characters and facial expressions. N\u014d masks are referenced throughout ''The Frolic of the Beasts''.<ref name=\"Translator's Note\"/> At the beginning of the novel's first chapter, K\u014dji humours himself with the thought that his own face \"is like a well-crafted, carved wooden mask.\"<ref>{{cite book|author=Yukio Mishima|title=The Frolic of the Beasts|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dMguDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT14|date=27 November 2018|publisher=Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-525-43416-0|page=14}}</ref><ref name=\"Translator's Note\"/> In the novel's prologue, Ippei's expression is described as an \"interminable smile\", which recalls the fixed expression of N\u014d masks.<ref>{{cite book|author=Yukio Mishima|title=The Frolic of the Beasts|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Wi17DwAAQBAJ&pg=PA6|year=2018|publisher=Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-525-43415-3|page=6}}</ref><ref name=\"Translator's Note\"/><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://lithub.com/the-frolic-of-the-beasts/ |title=The Frolic of the Beasts |date=28 November 2018 |website=[[Literary Hub]] |accessdate=11 March 2020}}</ref> Also, the \"dark grape luster\" of Y\u016bko's \"characteristic thick lipstick\" is likely a direct reference to the archetypal \"young woman\" (Wakaonna) character portrayed in Noh productions.<ref name=\"Translator's Note\"/><ref>{{cite book|author=Yukio Mishima|title=The Frolic of the Beasts|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dMguDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT20|date=27 November 2018|publisher=Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-525-43416-0|page=20}}</ref> In his review for ''[[The Japan Times]]'', Damian Flanagan also compared the \"jumbled\" nature of the novel's nonlinear narrative as creating a \"transcendent unearthliness\" similar to that of a Noh play.<ref name=\"The Japan Times\"/>\n\nMiyoko Tanaka, the commentator in the original Shinchosha paperback edition of the novel says that both in the form of the story, which is \"like a dream rising from weed-infested ruins,\" and from the descriptions of the faces of the characters, \"we Japanese clearly recognize vestiges of the traditional Noh theater performance.\"\n\nMishima was infatuated with the Noh theater and he wrote several Noh plays himself (adapted from ancient Noh performances). All of his plays were performed in Japan and some of them in other cities around the world, including New York. There is some speculation that Mishima was partly influenced in his choice of subject matter by the theme of Noh masks running through [[Fumiko Enchi]]'s novel, ''[[Masks (novel)|Masks]]''. It seems certain that Mishima rated Enchi highly and described this book as an \"esoteric masterpiece.\" Enchi's novel was published in 1958, three years before ''The Frolic of the Beasts''.\n\n==Plot==\n===Prologue===\nIn a photograph, three smiling individuals\u2013Ippei Kusakado, his wife Y\u016bko, and the youthful K\u014dji\u2013are seen standing on the harbor wall in Iro Village, a rural fishing port in the western part of the [[Izu Peninsula]] in [[Shizuoka Prefecture]]. The photograph was taken on a hot summer day. It was taken only days before \"the final wretched incident\". It was immediately sent to the chief priest of Taisenji temple. In Iro, there are also rice paddies as well as the Kusakado greenhouses, located beside the Kusakado family home. On the mountainside lies a new graveyard, reaching halfway up the slope of the mountain from its base. In spite of opposition from the villagers, the chief priest of Taisenji temple erected the new graves with the money that was entrusted to him. Ippei's grave lies on the right, K\u014dji's on the left, and Y\u016bko's in the center. Y\u016bko's, however, is only a \"living monument\", reserved for her eventual death.\n\n===Chapter 1===\n[[File:Nishiizu 20121019.jpg|thumb|Izu coastline in Nishiizu.]]\nK\u014dji is released from prison. He travels by boat from [[Numazu]] to Iro Village, where Y\u016bko is waiting for him. K\u014dji tells himself that he has repented and is a different person, but once he arrives he is immediately told by Y\u016bko that he hasn't changed. Y\u016bko had become his guarantor upon his release, but they both question whether they have made a mistake in K\u014dji coming to Iro. Y\u016bko closed the Tokyo shop a year ago, moved to Iro, and started the Kusakado greenhouse, which K\u014dji will work in. The two of them walk through Iro to the Kusakado house. Greeted by villagers on the way, K\u014dji is ashamed knowing rumours of his past will spread but Y\u016bko tells him to keep his head up. K\u014dji is seized by fear when he sees Ippei in front of the gate of the house.\n\n===Chapter 2===\nTwo years earlier, when he was a 21-year-old university student, K\u014dji was hired to work at a Western ceramics shop in Ginza, Tokyo. Ippei Kusakado, a 40-year-old man, is the owner and manager of the ceramics shop but also translates and reviews German literature in his spare time. While drinking together at a bar, Ippei tells K\u014dji about his unhappiness with his wife Y\u016bko's lack of jealousy. He says he has tried everything to make her jealous, confessing to his numerous affairs. K\u014dji, jealous of Ippei's \"corrupt heart\", falls in love with Y\u016bko that night, despite not having met her before. K\u014dji begins a secret affair with Y\u016bko. One night, Y\u016bko told K\u014dji that she knows Ippei has been adulterous, showing him documentation from a private investigator who tracked his infidelity. She cried, but told K\u014dji not to tell her husband of her suffering. On a summer's day, six months after he first met Y\u016bko, K\u014dji is waiting for Y\u016bko outside a hospital. He spots a black wrench laying on the ground and puts it in his jacket pocket. Much later while in prison, K\u014dji reflected on the wrench, viewing it as a manifestation of \"[[Will (philosophy)|will]]\" that had become a material phenomen which sought to \"upset the very foundations\" of the order of his world. That evening, Y\u016bko and K\u014dji walk in on Ippei and find him with a lover, Machiko. Y\u016bko simply asks Ippei to \"return home quietly\". K\u014dji expected a grand confrontation, where \"the truth of\nperverse human nature begins to shine\". He instead sees it as \"nothing other than things he had grown utterly tired of seeing: the mediocre concealment of human shame, the irony of keeping up appearances.\" Y\u016bko, crying and jabbering, is struck across the cheek twice by Ippei. K\u014dji immediately reacts without \"emotion, objective, or motive\", and repeatedly bashes the left side of Ippei's head with the wrench he had placed in the pocket of his jacket.\n\n===Chapter 3===\nIn Iro, K\u014dji meets Ippei for the first time since he was imprisoned. K\u014dji's assault leaves Ippei with a fractured cranium and a cerebral contusion. Ippei is diagnosed with [[aphasia]] and [[Hemiplegia|paralysis on his right side]], and is left with an \"interminable smile\". K\u014dji explains his assault as driven by an extreme unease with enduring that \"world bereft of logic\", and chose to impart the \"cold, hard, black logic of iron\" of the wrench. K\u014dji works in the Kusakado greenhouse with fellow gardener Teijiro. One day, K\u014dji, Y\u016bko and Ippei go for a picnic at the nearby waterfall and greet Kakujin, the priest of Taisenji temple, on the way. They stop at the village shrine to make a peace offering with a lily, but Y\u016bko is unimpressed with the shrine's appearance and size. Y\u016bko's sacrilege scares K\u014dji. Y\u016bko suddenly begins to taunt Ippei, asking him if he understands \"sacrifice\". Ippei replies that he does not understand and K\u014dji tries to defend him but Y\u016bko cuts K\u014dji off and calls Ippei an idiot. Y\u016bko throws the lily into the plunge pool, and Ippei's face displays \"a look of pure anxiety born of being cut off from all understanding\". She asks Ippei if he understands the word \"kiss\", then passionately kisses K\u014dji in front of him. K\u014dji scolds Y\u016bko for using him for Ippei's sake. She answers, asserting she has used K\u014dji from the beginning and that he surely likes it. K\u014dji strikes Y\u016bko across the cheek and turns to Ippei, who has a fixed smile on his face. Terrified, K\u014dji embraces Y\u016bko to erase the fear from his mind, but her kiss \"had lost completely its exquisite taste\".\n\n===Chapter 4===\nOne evening, K\u014dji is drinking alone at the Storm Petrel, the only bar in Iro Village. He gossips with the bar's owner about Teijir\u014d's young daughter, Kimi. K\u014dji has never heard Teijir\u014d speak about Kimi, and senses that there are ill feelings between them. After Kimi's mother died, they had lived together until Kimi suddenly left for Hamamatsu to become a factory girl. Kimi has not interacted with Teijir\u014d since returning to Iro for a ten-day vacation from her work at the Imperial Instruments factory in Hamamatsu. Kimi is strikingly beautiful and makes the village girls of Iro jealous by her presence. She carries a ukulele with her wherever she goes. At around 9:00 p.m., Kimi, Matsukichi, and Kiyoshi enter the bar and K\u014dji joins them at their table. Matsukichi is a fisherman and Kiyoshi is a member of the Japan Air Self-Defense Force ground crew. They are both Kimi's childhood friends, and have quarrelled with each other over her love ever since. K\u014dji envies Kiyoshi's \"simple lyrical spirit\", but considers Matsukichi \"a dull-witted young animal\". Looking at the three characters, K\u014dji thinks of Y\u016bko, who has not permitted him to kiss her since the incident during the picnic. He realises the depth of his love for Y\u016bko and repeats \"I have repented\" to himself. Together in the bar, K\u014dji, Kimi, Matsukichi, and Kiyoshi all get drunk and Kimi offers up her ukulele, swearing that whichever of the young men gets it will be the one who gets her love. Interested, they all leave in a small boat and travel to Urayasu where they go nude swimming. They walk into Urayasu forest and start a bonfire, where Kimi refuses to give up her ukulele. Matsukichi steals the instrument from Kimi, then passes it to Kiyoshi. The two men pass it back and forth to each other as Kimi attempts to take it back. Matsukichi and Kiyoshi take the ukulele and jump into the boat together, rowing into the bay by themselves. K\u014dji and Kimi return to the forest bonfire. Kimi says she purposely did not swim after the boat because she wished be alone with K\u014dji. Kimi says she respects K\u014dji's love for Y\u016bko, but is \"prepared to make a sacrifice and act as a stand-in\". K\u014dji and Kimi have sex, but K\u014dji cannot suppress the thought that the experience is \"nothing but a poor imitation\" of the \"perfect flesh\" that he created and refined with his imagination while in prison. They swim across the bay and return home. Several days later, K\u014dji hears rumours that Kiyoshi kept the ukulele, carrying it around wherever he went to the envy of the other young men in the village. That night, after drinking at the bar, Matsukichi confesses to K\u014dji that he and Kiyoshi made a secret pact. Kiyoshi only cared about his reputation, and agreed to never lay a hand on Kimi. The night after they went to Urayasu, Kimi gave herself to Matsukichi. When Matsukichi told Kimi of their pact, she laughed but accepted his proposal nonetheless. K\u014dji is surprised that Matsukichi has no inkling that he and Kimi had sex while alone on the island together.\n\n===Chapter 5===\nWhile working in the greenhouse, Teijir\u014d suddenly confesses to K\u014dji that he raped Kimi. Teijir\u014d then shows K\u014dji a pornographic photograph of a boy in a student's uniform having sex with a girl in a sailor uniform, and remarks that the girl has a similar appearance to that of Kimi. K\u014dji is disturbed by Teijir\u014d's unsolicited confession, and questions what the purpose of his confession was. Kimi stops by the Kusakado house to say goodbye before leaving to return to the factory in Hamamatsu. Looking at her, K\u014dji theorises that Kimi had slept with him and persuaded Matsukichi to love her only in order to infect them with the \"germ-like secret of her father's crime\" without letting them know her truth. He imagines she was quitely picturing \"the origin of her burning, rejuvenating humiliation and self-loathing\" while they had sex. Kimi says goodbye and squeezes K\u014dji's hands, gazing in his eyes. K\u014dji stares only at Y\u016bko, who takes out a hairpin from her hair and pricks the back of Kimi's hand. Kimi leaves, running down the slope laughing maniacally, while Y\u016bko turns away with a frown on her face. In the heat of that night, K\u014dji is lying on his bed while covered by a mosquito net. Y\u016bko enters K\u014dji's room and tells him she stuck her hairpin in the hand of the \"conceited\" Kimi to warn her, not out of jealously. Y\u016bko compares her action to that of K\u014dji with the wrench, and reveals that she is jealous of Koji's crime. She is jealous of \"not having a crime to her name\" that would allow her to at least \"stand beside him\". K\u014dji and Y\u016bko passionately embrace between the mosquito net, but Y\u016bko sees a figure outside and loudly screams that her husband is approaching. K\u014dji realises Y\u016bko wishes to be caught by Ippei, that it would liberate her from her \"long-continued suffering\". He is infuriated by Y\u016bko and refuses to let her through the mosquito net, not wanting to be caught by Ippei in an adulterous position with Y\u016bko. Ippei climbs the stairs and tells Y\u016bko he wants to sleep there because it is cool. Several days later, after a typhoon passes and misses West Izu, K\u014dji speaks with Kakujin the priest at Taisenji temple. He sees Y\u016bko and Ippei coming down the slope, and Y\u016bko asks K\u014dji to accompany Ippei on his daily walk. K\u014dji decides to confront Ippei on their walk, vehemently questioning him and accusing him of elaborately tormenting Y\u016bko and him under the guise of his mental incapacity. He calls him a \"hollow cavern\" and \"empty hole\" which the household revolves around. K\u014dji asks Ippei what he wants, to which Ippei responds he wishes to go home. K\u014dji is angered by this \"childlike supplication\" and further presses Ippei, asking him what he really wants. Ippei responds, \"Death. I want to die.\" They meet back up with Y\u016bko, and K\u014dji tells her that he feels his life is being lived solely for Ippei's sake. There is a tacit understanding between them, and Y\u016bko says, \"There's no going back now after all of this.\" The three of them arrive at the harbor, and Y\u016bko says they should travel to the other side of the bay one day. She suggests Teijir\u014d take them over in the boat in the middle of the day and that they should take \"lots of pictures\".\n\n===Epilogue===\nOn a summer vacation, a folklore researcher travels to Iro and speaks with a priest, Kakujin, who recounts his memories of Ippei, Y\u016bko, and K\u014dji. Kakujin tells of the time Y\u016bko and K\u014dji appeared at Taisenji temple, confessing to strangling Ippei to death. Kakujin shows the researcher the photo described in the novel's prologue. It had been given to him the day before Ippei was murdered. K\u014dji testified that he murdered Ippei at Ippei's request, but K\u014dji's gifting of the photograph to the priest was used as indelible evidence of [[Malice aforethought|premeditated]] murder. K\u014dji was given the death penalty, and Y\u016bko was sentenced to life imprisonment. While in prison, Y\u016bko requested Kakujin to arrange their graves side by side, with Y\u016bko in between. The researcher visits the graves, and takes a photograph. The priest asks the researcher to deliver the photograph on his behalf to Y\u016bko in person. The researcher later travels to Tochigi prison and meets Y\u016bko. Looking at the photograph, she thanks the researcher and says, \"Now I can serve my time in peace.\" Y\u016bko puts the photograph in her pocket and leaves.\n\n==Setting==\n[[File:Westcoast@izu - panoramio (1).jpg|thumb|270px|The harbor in Tago, [[Nishiizu]], just south of present-day Arari.]]\n\"Iro Village\" is a fictional place set in the former fishing village of [[:ja:\u5b89\u826f\u91cc\u6751|Arari]], which was merged into the current town of [[Nishiizu]].
