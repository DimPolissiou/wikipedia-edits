It was created by Laura Gibson and developed by Charlie Bennett. The show consisted of eight episodes, all of which were released on 17 April 2020 on [[Netflix]]. The host of the series is a [[virtual assistant]], named \"Lana\", who will give the cast the rules they must follow for the season; [[Desiree Burch]] provided voice-over narration. The premise of the show is to teach young, single people to create genuine connections instead of their usual [[One-night stand|flings]]. If contestants engage in any sexual contact on the island, then the prize money would decrease, starting at {{USD|100000|long=no}}.\n\nOn finale night, Bryce Hirschberg, Chloe Veitch, David Birtwistle, Francesca Farago, Harry Jowsey, Kelz Dyke, Lydia Clyma, Nicole O'Brien, Rhonda Paul, and Sharron Townsend were all deemed the winners of ''Too Hot to Handle'' and split the {{USD|75000|long=no}} prize.\n\n== Format ==\nThe series will follow the original group of ten singles as they are taken to a special island villa for four weeks to find love and {{USD|100000|long=no}}. However, twelve hours into the retreat, the contestants are informed by a [[virtual assistant]], Lana,<ref name=\"ENews\">{{cite web |last1=Harnick |first1=Chris |title=Too Hot to Handle Tasks Horny Contestants With Keeping Their Hands to Themselves for Money |url=https://www.eonline.com/news/1139399/too-hot-to-handle-tasks-horny-contestants-with-keeping-their-hands-to-themselves-for-money |website=eonline.com |publisher=ENews |accessdate=10 April 2020 |date=10 April 2020 |url-status=live}}</ref> that they [[Sexual abstinence|cannot do anything sexual]], such as kissing, [[Sexual intercourse|sex]], or [[Masturbation|masturbating]].

Once the light turned on, the rules of the retreat were void for the contestant and they were able to explore their connection further. If their connection was strong enough, they were able to have a night at the private suite, but their lights would not turn on during the night, so they still needed to follow the rules.<ref>{{Cite episode |title=Two's Company, Three's a ...

If they were to spend the entire night with no contact, the amount of money they cost from the prize fund was added back. Before the prize fund was allocated, several contestants were eliminated since they failed to seek personal growth.
