Ethnic, social and linguistic differences become each day more and more present and marked all over the world. Time, history and continuous population intermingling across boundaries led to create cosmopolitan beings, that is to say world citizens who, in spite of their singularity, manage to bring themselves together in order to create a unique and single nation. Among the nations most affected by this cross-fertilization is notably found Mauritius. The social and linguistic diversity of this country makes it unique and contribute to its wealth. It arouses curiosity, urges us to deepen our knowledge on the subject and is, to this extent, worth being studied.\n\n== History and linguistic consequences ==\n\n=== Discovery of the island ===\n\n[[History of Mauritius|Mauritius]] was first discovered by Arab sailors during the 5th century. The island was rediscovered by the Portuguese during the 16th century. At the same time, the latter also noticed the existence of other territories located in the [[Pacific Ocean]], near [[Madagascar]]. Nevertheless, this new territorial awareness did not urge the Portuguese to settle in the newly discovered islands so that this geographical area will only be exploited later on to become a series of international centres where different ethnic groups will meet and therefore create a new heterogeneous culture. In the 17th century, the Dutch and the French began to develop an interest for these new territories. This interest was motivated by strategic and commercial reasons though they failed in their attempt to colonize the previously mentioned area. Indeed, the Dutch left the island in 1710 after having honoured their Prince, [[Maurice of Nassau, Prince of Orange|Maurice of Nassau]], by naming the island ''Mauritius''. With the arrival of the French, this denomination will be replaced by ''\u00cele de France''.\n\n=== The island as a French colony ===\n\nThe first French colonists arrived in Mauritius in 1721 and decided to settle for strategic reasons. Indeed, they used the island as a military and commercial cornerstone because, at this time of the history, the French had in mind to conquer India and expand the spice trade. Mauritius was therefore useful as a port of call since it gave the French the opportunity to obtain fresh supplies and rest from their long journey. Gradually, the French will call in slaves mainly coming from Africa, Madagascar, Mozambique, and India in order to build a large harbour in Mauritius. This interaction between French and African people will then lead to the creation of a pidgin, that is to say, a language that is only used by populations of distinct origins as a means of communication. A ''[[pidgin]]'', by definition, isn't the mother tongue of any community but rather emerges from the interaction of each language spoken by each distinct community. When a pidgin becomes further used by new generations as a mother tongue, it loses its name of pidgin and begins to be called ''[[Creole language|Creole]]''. As the consequence of the French colonization, the Creole still spoken nowadays in Mauritius has French roots. Moreover, from this time on, the country will remain well influenced by the French culture, its language and its religion.  A great number of Indians will incidentally convert to Christianity.  The Indo-Mauritians who adopted a French culture at this point of the history will be considered as Creoles,<ref>The term Creole designates here the former African slaves and their descendants.</ref> as opposed to the Indo-Mauritians who will settle in the island much later.\n\n=== The island as a British colony ===\n\nIn 1810, the island becomes British. The new colonizers will give it back its former name of ''Mauritius'' and will carry out various important changes even though they will allow Creoles to keep their culture, religion (mostly Christianity), laws, and property. First, they will develop the exploitation of sugar cane, what will better the economic status of the island. Then, the island will know a big improvement in the field of human rights with [[Abolitionism in the United Kingdom|abolition of slavery]] in 1835. As a consequence of this important change, a noticeable number of Indians and Chinese will emigrate to the island and become [[indentured labourer]]s<ref>Indentured labourers are foreigners contracted to work for a determined period of time</ref> or shopkeepers. The emergence of new ethnic communities will enhance the Mauritian culture in so far as it will increase the number of languages spoken throughout the territory. Among these new languages are Bhojpuri (spoken by Indians coming from Bihar), Hindi, Urdu, Tamil, Telugu (languages spoken by Indians coming from Madras), Marathi (spoken by populations coming from Bombay), Hakka Chinese and Cantonese ([[varieties of Chinese]]). Moreover, at this time, the English language is used in the administration at the expense of the French one.  Nevertheless, the English people settled in the island tended to adopt the French culture and the Franco-Mauritians\u2019 language and will only try to promote their own language during the 19th century.\n\n=== The island as an independent state ===\n\n==== Politics and economy ====\n\nIn 1968, [[Mauritius]] becomes an independent state even though it still belongs to the [[Commonwealth of Nations]]. The island only becomes a Republic in 1992. The economy of the land is no more limited to the exploitation of sugar cane and one begins to rely on new resources such as industry, tourism, capital market. In 2001, the island counts 1 185 000 inhabitants. This population is composed of 68% of Indians <ref>Among these Indians, 58% of them are Hindus and 16% Muslims</ref> (Tamils, Telugus, Marathis), 30% of ''General Population'' (28% of Creoles and 2% of Whites) and 2% of Chinese. These heterogeneous communities cohabit rather pacifically although discrimination and racism towards some cultures still exist today <ref>There is a conflict on one side between Creoles and Franco-Mauritians and on the other hand between Franco-Mauritians and Indo-Mauritians. This can easily be explained by the fact that, at first, Franco-Mauritians belonged to the higher social class contrarily to Creoles and Indo-Mauritians who were slaves or indentured workers.</ref>\n\n==== Linguistic communities ====\n\nIn Mauritius, the political organization is divided into four linguistic communities among which are Hindus, Muslims, Sino-Mauritians, and the ''General Population''. Contrarily to the two other communities, Hindu and Muslim communities differ from the others because of their belonging to a religious \u2013 and not ethnic \u2013 group.\n\n=====Indo-Mauritians=====\n\nHindus and Muslims belong to the Indo-Mauritian group since they both are communities coming from India.  Some Indians only speak Bhojpuri and know only little Hindi and Urdu in spite of the fact that its knowledge could be an important asset in international trade, these two languages being respectively the official languages of India and Pakistan.\n\n======Hindus======\nIt is the community that is composed of Bhojpuris, Marathis, Telugus, Tamils, Gujaratis, and Sindhis.\n\n======Muslims======\n\nAmong Muslims there are Biharis, Gujaratis, and Kutchis.\n\n=====Sino-Mauritians=====\n\nHakka Chinese and Cantonese belong to the Sino-Mauritian community. They mainly come from Guandgong (formerly Cantonese), from the South of China, from Singapore and Penang.\n\n=====The ''general population''=====\n\nThe ''General Population'' is made out of White people, Franco-Mauritians (descendant of colonizers), and Creoles. Nevertheless, the denomination Creole still has a pejorative connotation and still carries the idea of lower social class. It is the reason why some people prefer to use the terminology Persons of Color to designate the General Population.\n\n=====Interactions between communities=====\n\nMost people belonging to a same ethnic group, a same social class and having a same origin tend to live in a same area, which is not problematic since the roads are well developed in the whole island. Therefore, it is easy to move from one to the other extreme of the Mauritian territory. Thanks to the important development of roads, little villages are as well accessible as bigger cities.\n\nMost Hindus prefer to live in the country whereas other Indo-Mauritians \u2013 Muslims \u2013 prefer more urbanized areas. The population found in the capital and in urbanized zones is mostly the Sino-Mauritian population and the ''General Population''.\n\n=====Religions practiced in each community=====\n\nEach community is different from another from its particularities, culture, language and religion. It is the reason why so many distinct religions are spoken throughout the island. The four most developed religions are Hinduism, Islam, Catholicism and Buddhism. They are mostly practiced respectively by Hindus, Muslims, the ''General Population'' and Sino-Mauritians.\n\n==Languages in use==\n\n===Languages of worship===\n\nAt first, Mauritius was an empty island where little by little, people settled. As they did so, everyone came in with their culture, language and religious identity.  This is what explains the multicultural status of island and the existence of so many worships in such a small territory. Each religion brought by each community is still practiced in the language spoken by this community or at least in the original language in which this particular religion was practiced.\n\nHindus use Hindi, Telugu,Tamil, and Marathi in their worship. Most here Telugu is used as third language here over 30000 Telugu people are living with their unforgettable traditions. Even though Bhojpuri is a language well used by Hindus in their daily life, it is not used as a language of worship because of its spoken status which confer it its unworthiness.\n\nMuslims read the Koran in Arabic but the imam communicates with his congregation in Urdu or in Gujarati.\n\nAs far as Buddhists are concerned, the language used in the practice of their worship is the Chinese. Finally, the Catholics mainly use the French language in their cult since Creole as the same kind of negative connotation as Bhojpuri which is considered as an unworthy language. Therefore, Creole is only used by clergymen when directly addressing to the audience (when telling sermons for instance).\n\n===Official language===\n\nThe only official language of Mauritius is English, which is consequently the language of administration. Nevertheless, French is spoken at the Assembly and by the deputies of the General Population. It is also necessary to mention the difference between oral and written use of the language. Official documents are redacted in English whereas French and Creole are accepted when addressing the population. Indeed, by using the Creole language, the members of the administration make sure that everyone understands what is being said. It is incidentally used during the elections. Indian and Chinese languages are not really used by the state except when a politician directly targets a specific community. In this case, Hindi and Bhojpuri could for example be used.\n\n===Languages of the media===\n\nFrench is the language most used in the media even though it is rather frequent to come across English headlines in the newspapers. Moreover, English can also be found in British or American press as well as in government communications although comments and conclusions raised at the legislative Assembly are usually translated into French. Creole also appears in the media, more specifically in humorous or parodic quotes and in left-wing press. In this field, the least represented languages are the Indian and Chinese languages even though Hindustani \u2013 a word referring to Hindi and Urdu as spoken languages \u2013 is quite used in the Indian and Pakistani cinema.\n\n=== Publishing languages===\n\nContrarily to many countries in which most books are written and published in the official language of the specific territory, Mauritius works differently. First, it is important to differentiate the different types of books existing. Literature is often written in French whereas one usually deals with scientific and technical works in English since English is the language used in academic education and research studies. As far as Indo-Mauritians are concerned, only books of religious or didactical nature are written. At the present time, few works are redacted in Creole, Bhojpuri and Hindi despite the fact that there is a rising number of published documents written in English and Hindi.\n\n===Languages in the advertisement===\n\nAs far as advertising is concerned, the three languages most used are French, English and Creole. The choice of one language rather than another depends on the commercialized product and on the public targeted. Moreover, a frequent diglossia is noticeable, on the one hand between French and English and on the other hand between French and Creole. It is the reason why it sometimes happens that a catch-phrase should begin in a language and end in another one.\n\n===Languages of the education===\n\nIn Mauritius, there is a specific tutorial system. Usually, children first go to primary school and it is compulsory. The latter consists of six years of study after which children should take and pass their \u201cSchool Certificate\u201d to have access to secondary school. Five years later, children are supposed to receive their \u201cCambridge Higher School Certificate\u201d (HSC) and if they want to go on with their studies they then go to college where seven years of study are needed to obtain a master's degree.\n\nFrom their first year of primary school on, children learn both English and French which is compulsory. English and French are two compulsory languages which are taught up to the level of Cambridge School Certificate (SC). Since 1955, Chinese and Indian students attend classes dedicated to the learning of their culture and ancestral language so that they learn a third language in addition to the two other languages mentioned above. Meanwhile, Catholic Creoles go to their catechism class.\n\nChinese children don't learn, contrarily to what one could think, Hakka or Cantonese which are their mother tongue or at least the mother tongue of their ancestors but rather Mandarin which is the most spoken language in China. The knowledge of this language is a major asset since it is an international language pretty useful in international trading. (Cantonese is also pretty useful in international trade.)\n\nAs for the Indians, they have the opportunity to choose to learn one Indian language according to their origins. Most primarily school propose to teach Hindi, Tamil, Urdu, Telegu and Marathi. All these languages have a same Indian origin but are nevertheless very different from one another and some of them incidentally use different alphabet in their writing. For instance, Hindi uses the Devanagari alphabet whereas the writing of Urdu requests an Arab alphabet even though both languages are quite similar orally. They only acquired their respective particularities because of cultural and religious differences in which each of them was independently used. Indeed, Hindi is the language of Hindus whereas Urdu is the language of Muslims. The only Indian language not proposed in primary school is Bhojpuri. The reason for that is the fact that only few students are interested in learning it. Moreover, Bhojpuri is considered as a spoken language and is only used on paper in traditional and popular poetry because of its negative connotation compared to Hindu or Urdu which are a lot more prestigious. This prestige probably comes from the international status of these two languages, contrarily to Bhojpuri which is only used locally since Mauritian Bhojpuri is quite different from the one currently spoken in India. Effectively, Indians coming from Calcutta used different dialects which, as time went by, became unified to form Mauritian Bhojpuri. Considering this whole point, we can conclude that the Indians and the Chinese are then dedicated to becoming cosmopolitan beings.\n\nSince 1944, the language of education is officially English - at the expense of French \u2013 excepted in languages classes in which lessons are given in the language being learnt. Nevertheless, Creole is still used by some teachers as an understanding tool.  The use of the Mauritians\u2019 mother tongue allows the latter to diminish the number of potential confusions and misunderstandings of the material being taught. To make sure that everyone understand perfectly what a specific lesson deals with, many teachers answer to questions in Creole and repeat a same piece of information twice: once in English and once in Creole.\n\n==Conclusion==\n\nMauritius, this island located in the Indian Ocean and eastward from Africa, is a multiethnic and multilingual country in which a great number of languages are known and spoken. The Mauritians are strongly interested in international languages in order to favour international trade and to crave out its niche in the world. It is incidentally one of the developing nation whose evolution is the most remarkable and impressive. Despite its desire of international interactions, Mauritius still remains strongly attached to its roots and wants to keep its cultural patrimony at all costs. The diversity of the island can however sometimes cause tensions and incomprehension between members of different communities but nonetheless it allows to international relations and contributes above all to the wealth and the maintaining of the Mauritian culture.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n* Peter Stein, Connaissance et emploi des langues \u00e0 l'\u00cele Maurice (Buske Verlag, 1982).\n* David Martial, Identit\u00e9 Et Politique Culturelle \u00c0 L'\u00eele Maurice: Regards Sur Une Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Plurielle (Paris: L'Harmattan, 2002).\n* Isabelle Widmer, La R\u00e9union Et Maurice: Parcours De Deux \u00celes Australes Des Origines Au XXe Si\u00e8cle (Paris: Institut national d'\u00e9tudes d\u00e9mographiques, 2005).\n* Atchia Emmerich, Bilkiss, \u201cLa situation linguistique \u00e0 l'\u00eele Maurice.

The Mauritians are strongly interested in international languages in order to favour international trade and to crave out its niche in the world. It is incidentally one of the developing nation whose evolution is the most remarkable and impressive. Despite its desire of international interactions, Mauritius still remains strongly attached to its roots and wants to keep its cultural patrimony at all costs. The diversity of the island can however sometimes cause tensions and incomprehension between members of different communities but nonetheless it allows to international relations and contributes above all to the wealth and the maintaining of the Mauritian culture.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n* Peter Stein, Connaissance et emploi des langues \u00e0 l'\u00cele Maurice (Buske Verlag, 1982).\n* David Martial, Identit\u00e9 Et Politique Culturelle \u00c0 L'\u00eele Maurice: Regards Sur Une Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Plurielle (Paris: L'Harmattan, 2002).\n* Isabelle Widmer, La R\u00e9union Et Maurice: Parcours De Deux \u00celes Australes Des Origines Au XXe Si\u00e8cle (Paris: Institut national d'\u00e9tudes d\u00e9mographiques, 2005).\n* Atchia Emmerich, Bilkiss, \u201cLa situation linguistique \u00e0 l'\u00eele Maurice.

The special was nominated for a [[Primetime Emmy Award]] in 1994 for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Animated Program|Outstanding Animated Program (For Programming Less Than One Hour)]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.emmys.com/shows/flintstones-family-christmas|title=Flintstones Family Christmas|work=Emmys.com|publisher=[[Academy of Television Arts & Sciences]]|accessdate=2012-12-15}}</ref> This is the only appearance of Stoney and the final appearance of [[Pebbles Flintstone|Pebbles]] and [[Bamm-Bamm Rubble|Bamm-Bamm]] in their adult forms as well as their children, Chip and Roxy. Hanna-Barbera continued doing the series but with the original timeline.\n\n==Plot==\n[[Fred Flintstone]] gets into the Christmas spirit by hanging up decorations and being altogether joyful while awaiting the arrival of his daughter Pebbles, her husband Bamm-Bamm and their twin children, daughter Roxy and son Chip. After learning that they will arrive at 4pm, Fred and Barney leave to get their turkeysaurus for dinner. However, on the way back home they are mugged by a Santa. Fred hands over his wallet and watch and orders Barney to give him the bird, but while tossing the turkeysaurus the Santa \"breaks\" in half. Seizing the opportunity, the two run away from the mugger.\n\nWhen Fred and Barney get to the police station, they identify the thief, who turns out to be a \"caveless\" abandoned child named Stoney. According to the social worker, Stoney used to be the horror of foster homes because of his stealing habits. Feeling sympathy for Stoney, Wilma decides to take him in as a ward, despite Fred's initial reluctance. They try to show Stoney that they trust him and attempt to teach him that stealing is wrong.\n\nHowever, things get slightly bleaker when Pebbles and her family get stuck in an airport because of a blizzard. The Rubbles and the Flintstones then go Christmas tree shopping, but can't afford any that aren't \"smaller than their grandchildren\". Stoney attempts to help by convincing people to bet on him as he plays a game in order to earn enough money for the Flintstones to buy the tree. When a man loses, he chases Stoney, who runs for cover near Fred. The man claims that Stoney cheated him, and Fred asks if this is true. Stoney then truthfully replies \"no\", and when Fred believes him, he gets hit in the head with a tree by the man.\n\nFred then goes to the hospital, but his boss informs him that he can't participate in the Christmas parade (which is something Fred is quite eager to do since the beginning of the movie) and when he tries to protest, his boss finalizes his \"no\". To make it up to Fred, Stoney poses as his boss's driver and locks him up in the Flintstone's bathroom, which will allow Fred to participate in the parade. Instead, Fred saves his boss and ends up in jail, where he eventually bonds with Stoney. Fred even advises Stoney that cutting corners to get what you want is not the solution. Fred sees Stoney is a good kid. However, the social worker then takes Stoney away and considered to send him back to Juvie, and meanwhile Fred's boss makes him go to the parade. While there, Fred saves Stoney.\n\nAt home Fred sees Pebbles and her family, and Stoney bonds with the twins. Fred says that the new addition to the family gets to put the star on the Christmas tree. Stoney thinks Fred is referring to Roxy and Chip, but it turns out it is him and he becomes a Flintstone. Bamm-Bamm helps him put on the star and they all have a happy Christmas.\n\n==Voice cast==\n\n===Main cast===\n* [[Henry Corden]] as [[Fred Flintstone]]\n* [[Jean Vander Pyl]] as [[Wilma Flintstone]]\n* [[Frank Welker]] as [[Barney Rubble]], [[Dino (The Flintstones)|Dino]]\n* [[B.

{"title_page": "Voice analysis", "text_new": "{{more citations needed|date=February 2011}}\n'''Voice analysis''' is the study of [[Speech communication|speech]] sounds for purposes other than linguistic content, such as in [[speech recognition]]. Such studies include mostly medical analysis of the [[human voice|voice]]  ([[phoniatrics]]), but also [[speaker identification]].  More controversially, some believe that the truthfulness or emotional state of speakers can be determined using [[voice stress analysis]] or layered voice analysis.\n\n==Analysis methods==\nVoice problems that require voice analysis most commonly originate from the vocal folds or the laryngeal musculature that controls them, since the folds are subject to collision forces with each vibratory cycle and to drying from the air being forced through the small gap between them, and the laryngeal musculature is intensely active during speech or singing and is subject to tiring. However, dynamic analysis of the vocal folds and their movement is physically difficult. The location of the vocal folds effectively prohibits direct, invasive measurement of movement. Less invasive imaging methods such as [[x-ray]]s or [[ultrasound]]s do not work because the vocal cords are surrounded by cartilage, which distorts image quality. Movements in the vocal cords are rapid, [[Fundamental frequency|fundamental frequencies]] are usually between 80 and 300 [[Hertz|Hz]], thus preventing usage of ordinary video. [[Stroboscope|Stroboscopic]], and high-speed videos provide an option, but to see the vocal folds a fiberoptic probe leading to the camera must be positioned in the throat, which makes speaking difficult. In addition, placing objects in the pharynx usually triggers a gag reflex that stops voicing and closes the larynx. In addition, stroboscopic imaging is only useful when the vocal fold vibratory pattern is closely periodic.\n\nThe most important[<nowiki/>[[wikipedia:Manual of Style/Words to watch#Unsupported attributions|according to whom?]]] indirect methods are currently [[inverse filter]]ing of either microphone or oral airflow recordings and [[electroglottograph]]y (EGG).[<nowiki/>[[wikipedia:Citation needed|citation needed]]] In inverse filtering, the speech sound (the radiated acoustic pressure waveform, as obtained from a microphone) or the oral airflow waveform from a circumferentially vented (CV) mask is recorded outside the mouth and then filtered by a mathematical method to remove the effects of the vocal tract. This method estimates the glottal input of voice production by recording output and using a computational model to invert the effects of the vocal tract. The other kind of noninvasive indirect indication of vocal fold motion is the electroglottography, in which electrodes placed on either side of the subject's throat at the level of the vocal folds record the changes in the conductivity of the throat according to how large a portion of the vocal folds are touching each other. It thus yields one-dimensional information of the contact area. Neither inverse filtering nor EGG are sufficient to completely describe the complex 3-dimensional pattern of vocal fold movement, but can provide useful indirect evidence of that movement.\n\nAnother way to conduct voice analysis is to look at voice characteristics. Some characteristics of voice are [[phonation]], [[Pitch (music)|pitch]], [[loudness]], and rate. These characteristics can be used to evaluate a person's voice and can aid in the voice analysis process. Phonation is typically tested by looking at different types of data collected from a person such as words with long vowels, words with many phonemes, or just typical speech. A person's pitch can be evaluated by making the person produce the highest and lowest sounds they can, as well as sounds in between. A keyboard can be used to aid in this process. Loudness is valuable to look at because for certain people, loudness affects the way they produce certain sounds. Some people need to speak louder for certain phonemes in comparison to others just so they can produce them.[<nowiki/>[[wikipedia:Citation needed|citation needed]]] This can be tested by asking the person to use the same amount of loudness while singing a scale. Rate is also important because it looks at how fast or slow a person speaks.\n\n<ref>{{cite book|last1=Hapner|first1=Edie|last2=Stemple|first2=Joseph|title=Voice Therapy: Clinical Case Studies|date=2014|publisher=Plural Publishing}}</ref>\n\n==Use in medicine==\nA medical study of the voice can be, for instance, analysis of the voice of patients who have had a [[Polyp (medicine)|polyp]] removed from their [[vocal cords]] through an operation. Computerized methods can be used to assess such issues in an objective manner.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Toran|first=SiKC|last2=Lal|first2=B.

These analyses are generally performed on evidence for the purposes of evaluating the authenticity of the audio in question, enhancing features of the audio that may be hidden beneath distracting background noise, interpreting the audio from the perspective of a forensic expert, or in some cases for the purposes of [[speaker identification]].\n\nAn expert will employ a variety of techniques in their analysis. The minimum of procedures are \"critical listening, [[waveform]] analysis, and [[spectral analysis]]\". Critical listening involves a thorough breakdown of both foreground and background sounds through repetitive listening. Waveform analysis visualizes the audio for the examiner to see any irregularities that may occur. Spectral analysis visualizes the frequency of the audio for an examiner to pick out features of interest.\n\nOne case in which audio played a larger role is the [[Trial of George Zimmerman|Trayvon Martin case]], where a recording of a call made to the police was analyzed to determine if background screams came from [[George Zimmerman]] or from [[Trayvon Martin|Martin]].\n\n=== Forensic Voice ===\nExperts in forensic voice analyze recordings by examining transmitted and stored speech, enhancing it and decoding it for criminal investigations, court trials, and federal agencies.\n\nTo utilize audio recordings in court, a forensic phonetician must authenticate the recording to detect tampering, enhance the audio, and interpret the speech. Their first job is to ensure that the speech in the recording being used is comprehensible. Oftentimes, samples have poor sound quality due to environmental factors such as wind or movement. Other times the sound degradation is due to technological issues within the recording device. Any investigative work on speaker identification cannot be done until the recording is of proper quality. Different solutions for poor comprehensibility are done using computer programs that allow the user to filter and eliminate noise. Computer software is also able to convert the speech to spectra and waveforms, which is useful for the forensic phonetician. However, any work done on the recording should be done after a copy of the original recording is made.\n\nA main part of the forensic phonetician's job is speaker identification.The interpretation process might include piecing together a timeline, transcribing the dialog, and identifying unknown or unintelligible sounds in the audio recording. In court, the expert ultimately serves to explain the facts surrounding the audio evidence, providing an explanation of relevant acoustical and physical principles to explain what is evidenced by the recording. Reports are made to include detailed information, if there is a section of the recording that is not comprehensible or is inaudible, an explanation of what was happening (in the recording), and a description of what is missing from the recording.\n\n=== Speaker Identification ===\nVoice analysis has a role in [[Speaker recognition|speaker identification]]. This is when the identity of a speaker is unknown, and has to be identify from an array of other voices or suspects when pertaining to a crime investigation or court trial.\u00a0 Proper identification of speaker and voices particularly for criminal cases depend on a list of factors, like familiarity, exposure, delay, tone of voice, voice disguising, and accents. Familiarity with a speaker increases the chances of properly identifying a voice, and distinguishing it. The amount of exposure to a voice also aids in correctly identifying a voice, even if it is an unfamiliar one. A hearer that listen to a longer utterance or was exposed to a voice more often is better at recognizing a voice, than someone who perhaps was only able to hear one word. A delay between the time of hearing a voice and the time of identifying the speaker also decreases the prospect of identifying the correct speaker. The [[Tone (linguistics)|tone of voice]] affects the ability to identify the right speaker. If the tone does not match that of the speaker at the time of comparison, it will prove to be more difficult to analyse. Disguise of the voice, for example when a speaker is whispering, will also hinder the ability to accurately match and identify the speaker. In some cases, individuals who speak the same language as the speaker whose voice is being analysed will have an easier time identifying them because of the [[Stress (linguistics)|accent and stress]] of the voice. Speaker identification is additionally complicated by distortions from the technical method of recording and speaker based issues, such as emotional states or alternative motives causing a discrepancy between their voice and that of a recording.The methods of speaker identification in forensics include the use of earwitnesses who are used to identify voices they have heard, the aural-perceptual approach conducted by a specialist regarding the suprasegmentals of an individual\u2019s speech, and computer-based approaches.\n\n==See also==\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Audio signal processing]]\n* [[Digital signal processing]]\n* [[Speech processing]]\n* [[Stuttering]]\n* [[Voice biometrics]]\n{{colend}}\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n==External links==\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20090118004846/http://www.voicematters.net/ Voice Problems and Vocal Disorder Online Community (VoiceMatters.net)]\n\n[[Category:Voice technology]]\n[[Category:Biometrics]]\n[[Category:Human voice]]\n", "text_old": "{{refimprove|date=February 2011}}\n'''Voice analysis''' is the study of [[Speech communication|speech]] sounds for purposes other than linguistic content, such as in [[speech recognition]]. Such studies include mostly medical analysis of the [[human voice|voice]]  ([[phoniatrics]]), but also [[speaker identification]].  More controversially, some believe that the truthfulness or emotional state of speakers can be determined using [[voice stress analysis]] or layered voice analysis.\n\n<br />\n\n==Analysis methods==\nVoice problems that require voice analysis most commonly originate from the vocal folds or the laryngeal musculature that controls them, since the folds are subject to collision forces with each vibratory cycle and to drying from the air being forced through the small gap between them, and the laryngeal musculature is intensely active during speech or singing and is subject to tiring. However, dynamic analysis of the vocal folds and their movement is physically difficult. The location of the vocal folds effectively prohibits direct, invasive measurement of movement. Less invasive imaging methods such as [[X-ray|x-rays]] or [[Ultrasound|ultrasounds]] do not work because the vocal cords are surrounded by cartilage, which distorts image quality. Movements in the vocal cords are rapid, [[Fundamental frequency|fundamental frequencies]] are usually between 80 and 300 [[Hertz|Hz]], thus preventing usage of ordinary video. [[Stroboscope|Stroboscopic]], and high-speed videos provide an option, but to see the vocal folds a fiberoptic probe leading to the camera must be positioned in the throat, which makes speaking difficult. In addition, placing objects in the pharynx usually triggers a gag reflex that stops voicing and closes the larynx. In addition, stroboscopic imaging is only useful when the vocal fold vibratory pattern is closely periodic.\n\nThe most important[<nowiki/>[[wikipedia:Manual of Style/Words to watch#Unsupported%20attributions|according to whom?]]] indirect methods are currently [[Inverse filter|inverse filtering]] of either microphone or oral airflow recordings and [[Electroglottograph|electroglottography]] (EGG).[<nowiki/>[[wikipedia:Citation needed|citation needed]]] In inverse filtering, the speech sound (the radiated acoustic pressure waveform, as obtained from a microphone) or the oral airflow waveform from a circumferentially vented (CV) mask is recorded outside the mouth and then filtered by a mathematical method to remove the effects of the vocal tract. This method estimates the glottal input of voice production by recording output and using a computational model to invert the effects of the vocal tract. The other kind of noninvasive indirect indication of vocal fold motion is the electroglottography, in which electrodes placed on either side of the subject's throat at the level of the vocal folds record the changes in the conductivity of the throat according to how large a portion of the vocal folds are touching each other. It thus yields one-dimensional information of the contact area. Neither inverse filtering nor EGG are sufficient to completely describe the complex 3-dimensional pattern of vocal fold movement, but can provide useful indirect evidence of that movement.\n\nAnother way to conduct voice analysis is to look at voice characteristics. Some characteristics of voice are [[phonation]], [[Pitch (music)|pitch]], [[loudness]], and rate. These characteristics can be used to evaluate a person's voice and can aid in the voice analysis process. Phonation is typically tested by looking at different types of data collected from a person such as words with long vowels, words with many phonemes, or just typical speech. A person's pitch can be evaluated by making the person produce the highest and lowest sounds they can, as well as sounds in between. A keyboard can be used to aid in this process. Loudness is valuable to look at because for certain people, loudness affects the way they produce certain sounds. Some people need to speak louder for certain phonemes in comparison to others just so they can produce them.[<nowiki/>[[wikipedia:Citation needed|citation needed]]] This can be tested by asking the person to use the same amount of loudness while singing a scale. Rate is also important because it looks at how fast or slow a person speaks.\n\n<ref>{{cite book|last1=Hapner|first1=Edie|last2=Stemple|first2=Joseph|title=Voice Therapy: Clinical Case Studies|date=2014|publisher=Plural Publishing}}</ref>\n\n==Use in medicine==\nA medical study of the voice can be, for instance, analysis of the voice of patients who have had a [[Polyp (medicine)|polyp]] removed from their [[vocal cords]] through an operation.

Thus [[Nulliparity|not having children]] is a risk factor for ovarian cancer, likely because ovulation is suppressed via pregnancy.  During ovulation, cells are constantly stimulated to divide while ovulatory cycles continue. Therefore, [[Nulliparity|people who have not borne children]] are at twice the risk of ovarian cancer than those who have. A longer period of ovulation caused by early [[menarche|first menstruation]] and late [[menopause]] is also a risk factor.<ref name=\"Hoffman35\" /><ref name=\"CRUKRisks\" /><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Gong TT, Wu QJ, Vogtmann E, Lin B, Wang YL | title = Age at menarche and risk of ovarian cancer: a meta-analysis of epidemiological studies | journal = International Journal of Cancer | volume = 132 | issue = 12 | pages = 2894\u2013900 | date = June 2013 | pmid = 23175139 | pmc = 3806278 | doi = 10.1002/ijc.27952 }}</ref> Both obesity and hormone replacement therapy also raise the risk.<ref name=Harrisons/>\n\nThe risk of developing ovarian cancer is less for women who have fewer menstrual cycles, no menstrual cycles, [[breast feeding]], take oral contraceptives, have multiple pregnancies, and have a pregnancy at an early age.  The risk of developing ovarian cancer is reduced in women who have had [[tubal ligation]] (colloquially known as having one's \"tubes tied\"), both ovaries removed, or [[hysterectomy]] (an operation in which the uterus, and sometimes the cervix, is removed).<ref name=\"CDCsep2016\" /> Age is also a risk factor.<ref name = Harrisons/><ref name=\"Gib2016\"/>\n\n=== Hormones ===\nUse of fertility medication may contribute to ovarian [[borderline tumor]] formation, but the link between the two is disputed and difficult to study.<ref name=Jayson/> Fertility drugs may be associated with a higher risk of borderline tumors.<ref name=\":7\" /> Those who have been treated for infertility but remain nulliparous are at higher risk for epithelial ovarian cancer; however, those who are successfully treated for infertility and subsequently give birth are at no higher risk.

Higher doses of estrogen increase this risk.<ref name=\":7\" /> Endometriosis is another risk factor for ovarian cancer,<ref name=CRUKRisks/> as is pain with menstruation. Endometriosis is associated with clear-cell and endometrioid subtypes, low-grade serous tumors, stage I and II tumors, grade 1 tumors, and lower mortality.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\nBefore menopause, obesity can increase a person's risk of ovarian cancer, but this risk is not present after menopause. This risk is also relevant in those who are both obese and have never used HRT.

People with [[hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer]] (Lynch syndrome), and those with BRCA-1 and BRCA-2 genetic abnormalities are at increased risk.\n\nThe major genetic risk factor for ovarian cancer is a mutation in ''BRCA1'' or ''BRCA2'' genes, or in [[DNA mismatch repair]] genes, which is present in 10% of ovarian cancer cases. Only one [[allele]] need be mutated to place a person at high risk. The gene can be inherited through either the maternal or paternal line, but has variable [[penetrance]].<ref name=Harrisons/><ref name=Hoffman35/> Though mutations in these genes are usually associated with increased risk of breast cancer, they also carry a substantial lifetime risk of ovarian cancer, a risk that peaks in a person's 40s and 50s. The lowest risk cited is 30% and the highest 60%.<ref name=Jayson/><ref name=Harrisons/><ref name=Hoffman35/> Mutations in BRCA1 have a lifetime risk of developing ovarian cancer of 15\u201345%.<ref name=\":7\" /> Mutations in ''BRCA2'' are less risky than those with ''BRCA1'', with a lifetime risk of 10% (lowest risk cited) to 40% (highest risk cited).<ref name=Harrisons/><ref name=\":7\" /> On average, BRCA-associated cancers develop 15 years before their sporadic counterparts because people who inherit the mutations on one copy of their gene only need one mutation to start the process of carcinogenesis, whereas people with two normal genes would need to acquire two mutations.<ref name=Hoffman35/>\n\nIn the United States, five of 100 women with a [[first-degree relative]] with ovarian cancer will eventually get ovarian cancer themselves, placing those with affected family members at triple the risk of women with unaffected family members.

Type I ovarian cancers, which tend to be less aggressive, tend to have [[microsatellite instability]] in several genes, including both oncogenes (most notably ''[[BRAF (gene)|BRAF]]''  and ''[[KRAS]]'') and tumor suppressors (most notably ''[[PTEN (gene)|PTEN]]'').<ref name=\"Jayson\" /> The most common mutations in Type I cancers are ''KRAS, BRAF, ERBB2, PTEN, PIK3CA,'' and ''ARID1A.''<ref name=\":7\" /> Type II cancers, the more aggressive type, have different genes mutated, including ''[[p53]], BRCA1'', and ''BRCA2''.<ref name=Jayson/> Low-grade cancers tend to have mutations in KRAS, whereas cancers of any grade that develop from low malignant potential tumors tend to have mutations in p53.<ref name=Hoffman35/> Type I cancers tend to develop from precursor lesions, whereas Type II cancers can develop from a [[serous tubal intraepithelial carcinoma]].<ref name=\":7\" /> [[Serous cancer]]s that have BRCA mutations also inevitably have p53 mutations, indicating that the removal of both functional genes is important for cancer to develop.<ref name=\"Hoffman35\" />\n\nIn 50% of high-grade serous cancers, homologous recombination DNA repair is dysfunctional, as are the [[notch signaling pathway|notch]] and [[FOXM1]] signaling pathways. They also almost always have p53 mutations. Other than this, mutations in high-grade serous carcinoma are hard to characterize beyond their high degree of [[genomic instability]]. ''BRCA1'' and ''BRCA2'' are essential for homologous recombination DNA repair, and [[germline mutation]]s in these genes are found in about 15% of people with ovarian cancer.<ref name=Jayson/> The most common mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 are the [[frameshift mutations]] that originated in a small [[founder effect|founding population]] of Ashkenazi Jews.<ref name=Hoffman35/>\n\nAlmost 100% of rare mucinous carcinomas have mutations in ''KRAS'' and amplifications of ''ERBB2'' (also known as ''Her2/neu'').<ref name=Jayson/> Overall, 20% of ovarian cancers have mutations in ''Her2/neu''.<ref name=Harrisons/>\n\nSerous carcinomas may develop from [[serous tubal intraepithelial carcinoma]], rather than developing spontaneously from ovarian tissue.

The challenge in such an approach is that the disparate prevalence of ovarian cancer means that even testing with very high sensitivity and specificity will still lead to a number of false positive results, which in turn may lead to issues such as performing surgical procedures in which cancer is not found intraoperatively.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} [[Genomics]] approaches have not yet been developed for ovarian cancer.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\n[[CT scanning]] is preferred to assess the extent of the tumor in the abdominopelvic cavity, though [[magnetic resonance imaging]] can also be used.<ref name=\"Jayson\" /> CT scanning can also be useful for finding [[omental caking]] or differentiating fluid from solid tumor in the abdomen, especially in low malignant potential tumors. However, it may not detect smaller tumors. Sometimes, a [[Chest radiograph|chest x-ray]] is used to detect metastases in the chest or [[pleural effusion]]. Another test for metastatic disease, though it is infrequently used, is a [[barium enema]], which can show if the rectosigmoid colon is involved in the disease. [[Positron emission tomography]], [[bone scan]]s, and [[paracentesis]] are of limited use; in fact, paracentesis can cause metastases to form at the needle insertion site and may not provide useful results.<ref name=\"Hoffman35\" /> However, paracentesis can be used in cases where there is no pelvic mass and ascites is still present.<ref name=\"Hoffman35\" /> A physician suspecting ovarian cancer may also perform [[mammography]] or an [[endometrial biopsy]] (in the case of abnormal bleeding) to assess the possibility of breast malignancies and endometrial malignancy, respectively. [[Vaginal ultrasonography]] is often the first-line imaging study performed when an adnexal mass is found. Several characteristics of an adnexal mass indicate ovarian malignancy; they usually are solid, irregular, multilocular, and/or large; and they typically have papillary features, central vessels, and/or irregular internal septations.<ref name=\":7\" /> However, SCST has no definitive characteristics on radiographic study.<ref name=\":8\" />\n\nTo definitively diagnose ovarian cancer, a surgical procedure to inspect the abdomen is required. This can be an open procedure ([[laparotomy]], incision through the [[abdominal wall]]) or [[keyhole surgery]] ([[laparoscopy]]). During this procedure, suspicious tissue is removed and sent for [[Histopathology|microscopic analysis]]. Usually, this includes a unilateral [[salpingo-oophorectomy]], removal of a single affected ovary and Fallopian tube. Fluid from the abdominal cavity can also be analyzed for cancerous [[Cell (biology)|cells]]. If cancer is found, this procedure can also be used to determine the extent of its spread (which is a form of [[tumor staging]]).<ref name=Harrisons/>\n\n==== Risk scoring ====\n{{anchor | RMI}}A widely recognized method of estimating the risk of malignant ovarian cancer is the risk of malignancy index (RMI), calculated based on an initial [[Medical diagnosis#Other diagnostic procedure methods|workup]].<ref name=Jayson/><ref name=\"NICE2011\">{{cite web |url = http://publications.nice.org.uk/ovarian-cancer-cg122/appendix-d-risk-of-malignancy-index-rmi-i |work = NICE clinical guidelines |date = April 2011 |title = Guideline CG122.

These include [[fibroblast]]s and endocrine cells. The symptoms of a sex-cord or stromal ovarian tumor can differ from other types of ovarian cancer. Common signs and symptoms include [[ovarian torsion]], [[hemorrhage]] from or rupture of the tumor, an abdominal mass, and hormonal disruption. In children, [[precocious puberty#Isosexual and heterosexual|isosexual precocious pseudopuberty]] may occur with granulosa cell tumors since they produce estrogen. These tumors cause abnormalities in menstruation ([[menometrorrhagia|excessive bleeding]], [[oligomenorrhea|infrequent menstruation]], or [[amenorrhea|no menstruation]]) or postmenopausal bleeding. Because these tumors produce estrogen, they can cause or occur at the same time as [[endometrial cancer]] or [[breast cancer]]. Other sex-cord/stromal tumors present with distinct symptoms. Sertoli-Leydig cell tumors cause [[virilization]] and [[hirsutism|excessive hair growth]] due to the production of [[testosterone]] and [[androstenedione]], which can also cause [[Cushing's syndrome]] in rare cases. Also, sex-cord stromal tumors occur that do not cause a hormonal imbalance, including benign fibromas, which cause ascites and [[hydrothorax]].<ref name=Harrisons/> With germ cell tumors, sex cord-stromal tumors are the most common ovarian cancer diagnosed in women under 20.<ref name=\":8\"/>\n\n===== Granulosa cell tumor =====\nGranulosa cell tumors are the most common sex-cord stromal tumors, making up 70% of cases, and are divided into two histologic subtypes: adult granulosa cell tumors, which develop in women over 50, and juvenile granulosa tumors, which develop before puberty or before the age of 30. Both develop in the [[ovarian follicle]] from a population of cells that surrounds [[germinal cell]]s.<ref name=\":8\" />\n\n====== Adult granulosa cell tumor ======\nAdult granulosa cell tumors are characterized by later onset (30+ years, 50 on average). These tumors produce high levels of estrogen, which causes its characteristic symptoms: [[menometrorrhagia]]; [[endometrial hyperplasia]]; [[Breast pain|tender]], [[Breast enlargement|enlarged breasts]]; [[Vaginal bleeding|postmenopausal bleeding]]; and [[Amenorrhoea|secondary amenorrhea]]. The mass of the tumor can cause other symptoms, including abdominal pain and distension, or symptoms similar to an [[ectopic pregnancy]] if the tumor bleeds and ruptures.<ref name=\":8\" />\n\n====== Juvenile granulosa cell tumor ======\n\n===== Sertoli-Leydig cell tumor =====\nSertoli-Leydig tumors are most common in women before the age of 30, and particularly common before puberty.<ref name=\":8\" />\n\n===== Sclerosing stromal tumors =====\nSclerosing stromal tumors  typically occur in girls before puberty or women before the age of 30.<ref name=\":8\" />\n\n==== Germ cell tumor ====\n{{Main|Ovarian germ cell tumors}}\nGerm cell tumors of the ovary develop from the ovarian [[germ cells]].<ref name=\":1\" /> [[Germ cell tumor]] accounts for about 30% of ovarian tumors, but only 5% of ovarian cancers, because most germ-cell tumors are [[teratoma]]s and most teratomas are benign. Malignant teratomas tend to occur in older women, when one of the germ layers in the tumor develops into a [[squamous cell carcinoma]].<ref name=Harrisons/> Germ-cell tumors tend to occur in young women (20s\u201330s) and girls, making up 70% of the ovarian cancer seen in that age group.<ref name=Current>{{cite book |chapter = Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology |title = Current Diagnosis & Treatment Obstetrics & Gynecology |isbn = 978-0071638562  |edition = 11th |year = 2012 |first1 = Alan |last1 = DeCherney |first2 = Lauren |last2 = Nathan  |first3 = T.

Some germ-cell tumors have an [[isochromosome]] 12, where one arm of chromosome 12 is deleted and replaced with a duplicate of the other.<ref name=Harrisons/> Most germ-cell cancers have a better prognosis than other subtypes and are more sensitive to chemotherapy. They are more likely to be stage I at diagnosis.<ref name=\":8\" /> Overall, they metastasize more frequently than epithelial ovarian cancers. In addition, the cancer markers used vary with tumor type: [[choriocarcinomas]] are monitored with [[beta-HCG]] and endodermal sinus tumors with [[alpha-fetoprotein]].<ref name=Harrisons/>\n\nGerm-cell tumors are typically discovered when they become large, palpable masses. However, like sex cord tumors, they can cause ovarian torsion or hemorrhage and, in children, isosexual precocious puberty. They frequently metastasize to nearby lymph nodes, especially para-aortic and pelvic lymph nodes.<ref name=Harrisons/> The most common symptom of germ cell tumors is [[Abdominal pain|subacute abdominal pain]] caused by the tumor bleeding, [[Necrosis|necrotizing]], or stretching the [[ovarian capsule]]. If the tumor ruptures, causes significant bleeding, or torses the ovary, it can cause [[Acute abdomen|acute abdominal pain]], which occurs in less than 10% of those with germ-cell tumors. They can also secrete hormones which change the [[menstrual cycle]]. In 25% of germ-cell tumors, the cancer is discovered during a [[Well-woman examination|routine examination]] and does not cause symptoms.<ref name=\":8\" />\n\nDiagnosing germ cell tumors may be difficult because the normal menstrual cycle and [[puberty]] can cause pain and pelvic symptoms, and a young woman may even believe these symptoms to be those of pregnancy, and not seek treatment due to the stigma of [[Teenage pregnancy|teen pregnancy]]. Blood tests for alpha-fetoprotein, [[karyotype]], human chorionic gonadotropin, and liver function are used to diagnose germ cell tumor and potential co-occurring gonadal dysgenesis. A germ cell tumor may be initially mistaken for a benign [[ovarian cyst]].<ref name=\":8\" />\n\n===== Dysgerminoma =====\n{{Main|Dysgerminoma}}\nDysgerminoma accounts for 35% of ovarian cancer in young women and is the most likely germ cell tumor to metastasize to the lymph nodes; nodal metastases occur in 25\u201330% of cases.<ref name=Current/><ref name=\":8\" /> These tumors may have mutations in [[CD117|the ''KIT'' gene]], a mutation known for its role in [[gastrointestinal stromal tumor]]. [[Swyer syndrome|People with an XY karyotype and ovaries]] ([[gonadal dysgenesis]]) or an X,0 karyotype and ovaries ([[Turner syndrome]]) who develop a unilateral dysgerminoma are at risk for a [[gonadoblastoma]] in the other ovary, and in this case, both ovaries are usually removed when a unilateral dysgerminoma is discovered to avoid the risk of another malignant tumor. Gonadoblastomas in people with Swyer or Turner syndrome become malignant in approximately 40% of cases. However, in general, dysgerminomas are bilateral 10\u201320% of the time.<ref name=Harrisons/><ref name=\":8\" />\n\nThey are composed of cells that cannot [[Cellular differentiation|differentiate]] further and develop directly from germ cells or from gonadoblastomas. Dysgerminomas contain [[syncytiotrophoblast]]s in approximately 5% of cases, and can therefore cause elevated hCG levels. On gross appearance, dysgerminomas are typically pink to tan-colored, have multiple lobes, and are solid. Microscopically, they appear identical to [[seminoma]]s and very close to [[Embryonic germ cell|embryonic primordial germ cells]], having large, polyhedral, rounded [[clear cell]]s. The nuclei are uniform and round or square with prominent [[Nucleolus|nucleoli]] and the [[cytoplasm]] has high levels of [[glycogen]]. Inflammation is another prominent histologic feature of dysgerminomas.<ref name=\":8\" />\n\n===== Choriocarcinoma =====\n{{Main|Choriocarcinoma}}\nChoriocarcinoma can occur as a primary ovarian tumor developing from a germ cell, though it is usually a gestational disease that metastasizes to the ovary. Primary ovarian choriocarcinoma has  a poor prognosis and can occur without a pregnancy. They produce high levels of hCG and can cause [[Precocious puberty|early puberty]] in children or [[menometrorrhagia]] (irregular, heavy menstruation) after menarche.<ref name=\":8\" />\n\n===== Immature (solid) teratoma =====\n{{Main|Immature teratoma}}Immature, or solid, teratomas are the most common type of ovarian germ cell tumor, making up 40\u201350% of cases. Teratomas are characterized by the presence of disorganized tissues arising from all three embryonic [[germ layer]]s: [[ectoderm]], [[mesoderm]], and [[endoderm]]; immature teratomas also have undifferentiated [[stem cell]]s that make them more malignant than mature teratomas (dermoid cysts). The different tissues are visible on gross pathology and often include bone, cartilage, hair, [[mucus]], or [[Sebaceous gland|sebum]], but these tissues are not visible from the outside, which appears to be a solid mass with lobes and cysts. Histologically, they have large amounts of [[neuroectoderm]] organized into sheets and tubules along with [[Neuroglia|glia]]; the amount of neural tissue determines the histologic grade. Immature teratomas usually only affect one ovary (10% co-occur with dermoid cysts) and usually metastasize throughout the peritoneum. They can also cause mature teratoma implants to grow throughout the abdomen in a disease called [[growing teratoma syndrome]]; these are usually benign but will continue to grow during chemotherapy, and often necessitate further surgery. Unlike mature teratomas, immature teratomas form many [[Adhesion (medicine)|adhesions]], making them less likely to cause ovarian torsion. There is no specific marker for immature teratomas, but [[carcinoembryonic antigen]] (CEA), CA-125, CA19-9, or AFP can sometimes indicate an immature teratoma.<ref name=\":8\" />\n\nStage I teratomas make up the majority (75%) of cases and have the best prognosis, with 98% of patients surviving 5 years; if a Stage I tumor is also grade 1, it can be treated with unilateral surgery only. Stage II though IV tumors make up the remaining quarter of cases and have a worse prognosis,  with 73\u201388% of patients surviving 5 years.<ref name=\":8\" />\n\n===== Mature teratoma (dermoid cyst) =====\n{{Main|Dermoid cyst}}\nMature teratomas, or dermoid cysts, are rare tumors consisting of mostly benign tissue that develop after menopause. The tumors consist of disorganized tissue with nodules of malignant tissue, which can be of various types. The most common malignancy is [[Squamous-cell carcinoma|squamous cell carcinoma]], but [[adenocarcinoma]], [[basal-cell carcinoma]], [[Carcinoid|carcinoid tumor]], [[neuroectodermal tumor]], [[Melanoma|malignant melanoma]], [[sarcoma]], [[Sebaceous carcinoma|sebaceous tumor]], and [[struma ovarii]] can also be part of the dermoid cyst. They are treated with surgery and adjuvant platinum chemotherapy or radiation.<ref name=\":8\" />\n\n===== Yolk sac tumor/endodermal sinus tumor =====\n{{Main|Yolk sac tumor}}\n[[Yolk sac]] tumors, formerly called endodermal sinus tumors, make up approximately 10\u201320% of ovarian germ cell malignancies, and have the worst prognosis of all [[ovarian germ cell tumors]]. They occur both before menarche (in one-third of cases) and after menarche (the remaining two-thirds of cases). Half of the people with yolk sac tumors are diagnosed in stage I. Typically, they are unilateral until metastasis, which occurs within the peritoneal cavity and via the bloodstream to the lungs. Yolk sac tumors grow quickly and recur easily, and are not easily treatable once they have recurred. Stage I yolk sac tumors are highly treatable, with a 5-year disease-free survival rate of 93%, but stage II-IV tumors are less treatable, with survival rates of 64\u201391%.<ref name=\":8\" />\n\nTheir gross appearance is solid, friable, and yellow, with necrotic and hemorrhagic areas. They also often contain cysts that can degenerate or rupture. Histologically, yolk sac tumors are characterized by the presence of [[Schiller\u2013Duval body|Schiller-Duval bodies]] (which are pathognomonic for yolk sac tumors) and a reticular pattern. Yolk sac tumors commonly secrete [[alpha-fetoprotein]] and can be [[Immunohistochemistry|immunohistochemically]] stained for its presence; the level of alpha-fetoprotein in the blood is a useful marker of recurrence.<ref name=\":8\" />\n\n===== Embryonal carcinoma =====\n{{Main|Embryonal carcinoma}}\nEmbryonal carcinomas, a rare tumor type usually found in mixed tumors, develop directly from germ cells but are not terminally differentiated; in rare cases they may develop in dysgenetic gonads. They can develop further into a variety of other neoplasms, including choriocarcinoma, yolk sac tumor, and teratoma. They occur in younger people, with an average age at diagnosis of 14, and secrete both alpha-fetoprotein (in 75% of cases) and hCG.<ref name=\":8\" />\n\nHistologically, embryonal carcinoma appears similar to the [[embryonic disc]], made up of epithelial, [[Anaplasia|anaplastic]] cells in disorganized sheets, with gland-like spaces and papillary structures.<ref name=\":8\" />\n\n===== Polyembryoma =====\n{{Main|Polyembryoma}}\nPolyembryomas, the most immature form of teratoma and very rare ovarian tumors, are histologically characterized by having several [[embryo]]-like bodies with structures resembling a [[germ disk]], [[yolk sac]], and [[amniotic sac]]. [[Syncytiotrophoblast|Syncytiotrophoblast giant cells]] also occur in polyembryomas.<ref name=\":8\" />\n\n==== Squamous cell carcinoma ====\nPrimary ovarian squamous cell carcinomas are rare and have a poor prognosis when advanced. More typically, ovarian squamous cell carcinomas are cervical metastases, areas of differentiation in an endometrioid tumor, or derived from a mature teratoma.<ref name=\"Hoffman35\" />\n\n==== Mixed tumors ====\nMixed tumors contain elements of more than one of the above classes of tumor histology. To be classed as a mixed tumor, the minor type must make up more than 10% of the tumor.<ref name=\":7\" /> Though mixed carcinomas can have any combination of cell types, mixed ovarian cancers are typically serous/endometrioid or clear cell/endometrioid.<ref name=\"Hoffman35\" /> Mixed germ cell tumors make up approximately 25\u201330% of all germ cell ovarian cancers, with combinations of dysgerminoma, yolk sac tumor, and/or immature teratoma. The prognosis and treatment vary based on the component cell types.<ref name=\":8\" />\n\n==== Secondary ovarian cancer ====\nOvarian cancer can also be a secondary cancer, the result of [[metastasis]] from a primary cancer elsewhere in the body.<ref name=Harrisons/> About 7% of ovarian cancers are due to metastases, while the rest are primary cancers.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} Common primary cancers are [[breast cancer]], [[colon cancer]], [[appendiceal cancer]], and [[stomach cancer]] (primary gastric cancers that metastasize to the ovary are called [[Krukenberg tumor]]s).<ref name=Harrisons/> Krukenberg tumors have signet ring cells and mucinous cells.<ref name=\"Hoffman35\" /> Endometrial cancer and lymphomas can also metastasize to the ovary.<ref name=Levy>{{Cite book|title = Premalignant & Malignant Disorders of the Ovaries & Oviducts|last = Levy|first = Gary | name-list-format = vanc |publisher = McGraw-Hill|year = 2013|last2 = Purcell|last3 = Karen|work = CURRENT Diagnosis & Treatment: Obstetrics & Gynecology, 11e| veditors = DeCherney AH, Nathan L, Laufer N, Roman AS |url = http://accessmedicine.mhmedical.com/content.aspx?bookid=498&sectionid=41008645|isbn = 978-0-07-163856-2|url-status = live|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170910175639/http://accessmedicine.mhmedical.com/content.aspx?bookid=498&sectionid=41008645|archivedate = 2017-09-10}}</ref>\n\n==== Borderline tumors====\nOvarian [[borderline tumor]]s, sometimes called low malignant potential (LMP) ovarian tumors, have some benign and some malignant features.<ref name=\"Hoffman35\" /> LMP tumors make up approximately 10%-15% of all ovarian tumors.<ref name=\":7\" /><ref name=\":1\" /> They develop earlier than epithelial ovarian cancer, around the age of 40\u201349. They typically do not have extensive invasion; 10% of LMP tumors have areas of stromal microinvasion (<3mm, <5% of tumor). LMP tumors have other abnormal features, including increased mitosis, [[pleomorphism (cytology)|changes in cell size or nucleus size]], [[nuclear atypia|abnormal nuclei]], cell stratification, and [[papillary projections|small projections on cells]] (papillary projections). Serous and/or mucinous characteristics can be seen on histological examination, and serous histology makes up the overwhelming majority of advanced LMP tumors. More than 80% of LMP tumors are Stage I; 15% are stage II and III and less than 5% are stage IV.<ref name=Hoffman35/> Implants of LMP tumors are often non-invasive.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Staging ===\nOvarian cancer is staged using the [[International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics|FIGO]] staging system and uses information obtained after surgery, which can include a total [[Hysterectomy|abdominal hysterectomy]] via [[Laparotomy|midline laparotomy]], [[Salpingoophorectomy|removal of (usually) both ovaries and Fallopian tubes]], [[Omentectomy|(usually) the omentum]], [[pelvic washing|pelvic (peritoneal) washing]]s, assessment of [[Retroperitoneal lymph node dissection|retroperitoneal lymph nodes]] (including the [[Pelvic lymph nodes|pelvic]] and [[Paraaortic lymph node|para-aortic lymph nodes]]), [[appendectomy]] in suspected mucinous tumors, and pelvic/peritoneal biopsies for [[cytopathology]].<ref name=Jayson/><ref name=Harrisons/><ref name=\":7\" /><ref name=SGO/> Around 30% of ovarian cancers that appear confined to the ovary have metastasized microscopically, which is why even stage-I cancers must be staged completely.<ref name=Harrisons/> 22% of cancers presumed to be stage I are observed to have lymphatic metastases.<ref name=\":7\" /> The AJCC stage is the same as the FIGO stage.

Ovarian cancer metastases usually grow on the surface of organs rather than the inside; they are also common on the omentum and the peritoneal lining. Cancer cells can also travel through the [[lymphatic system]] and metastasize to lymph nodes connected to the ovaries via blood vessels; i.e. the lymph nodes along the [[Suspensory ligament of ovary|infundibulopelvic ligament]], the [[Broad ligament of the uterus|broad ligament]], and the [[Round ligament of uterus|round ligament]]. The most commonly affected groups include the [[paraaortic lymph node|paraaortic]], [[hypogastric lymph node|hypogastric]], [[external iliac lymph nodes|external iliac]], [[obturator lymph nodes|obturator]], and [[inguinal lymph node]]s. Usually, ovarian cancer does not metastasize to the liver, lung, brain, or kidneys unless it is recurrent disease; this differentiates ovarian cancer from many other forms of cancer.<ref name=\"Hoffman35\" />\n\n== Screening ==\nThere is no simple and reliable way to test for ovarian cancer in women who do not have any signs or symptoms. Screening is not recommended in women who are at average risk, as evidence does not support a reduction in death and the high rate of false positive tests may lead to unneeded surgery, which is accompanied by its own risks.<ref name=Gros2018/> The [[Pap test]] does not screen for ovarian cancer.<ref name = CDCsep2016/>\n\nOvarian cancer is usually only palpable in advanced stages.<ref name=Hoffman35/>  Screening is not recommended using [[CA-125]] measurements, [[HE4]] levels, ultrasound, or adnexal palpation in women who are at average risk. Risk of developing ovarian cancer in those with genetic factors can be reduced. Those with a genetic predisposition may benefit from screening.

Because ambiguous results are more likely than detection of a treatable problem, and because the usual response to ambiguous results is invasive interventions, in women of average risk, the potential harms of having screening without an indication outweigh the potential benefits. The purpose of screening is to diagnose ovarian cancer at an early stage, when it is more likely to be treated successfully.<ref name=Harrisons/><ref name=Harrisons82/>\n\nScreening with [[transvaginal ultrasound]], pelvic examination, and CA-125 levels can be used instead of preventive surgery in women who have BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations. This strategy has shown some success.<ref name=Hoffman35/>\n\n== Prevention==\nPeople with strong genetic risk for ovarian cancer may consider the surgical removal of their ovaries as a preventive measure.

The surgery depends upon the extent of nearby invasion of other tissues by the cancer when it is diagnosed. This extent of the cancer is described by assigning it a stage, the presumed type, and the grade of cancer. The gynecological surgeon may  remove one (unilateral oophorectomy) or both ovaries (bilateral oophorectomy). The Fallopian tubes (salpingectomy), uterus (hysterectomy), and the [[Greater omentum|omentum]] (omentectomy) may also be removed. Typically, all of these organs are removed.<ref name=\"CanadianCS2017\" />\n\nFor low-grade, unilateral stage-IA cancers, only the involved ovary (which must be unruptured) and Fallopian tube will be removed. This can be done especially in young people who wish to preserve their fertility. However, a risk of microscopic metastases exists and staging must be completed.<ref name=\"Jayson\" /> If any metastases are found, a second surgery to remove the remaining ovary and uterus is needed.<ref name=\":2\" /> [[Tranexamic acid]] can be administered prior to surgery to reduce the need for blood transfusions due to blood loss during the surgery.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\nIf a tumor in a premenopausal woman is determined to be a low malignant potential tumor during surgery, and it is clearly stage I cancer, only the affected ovary is removed. For postmenopausal women with low malignant potential tumors, hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy is still the preferred option. During staging, the appendix can be examined or removed. This is particularly important with mucinous tumors.<ref name=\"Hoffman35\" /> In children or adolescents with ovarian cancer, surgeons typically attempt to preserve one ovary to allow for the completion of [[puberty]], but if the cancer has spread, this is not always possible. Dysgerminomas, in particular, tend to affect both ovaries: 8\u201315% of dysgerminomas are present in both ovaries.<ref name=\"Current\" /> People with low-grade (well-differentiated) tumors are typically treated only with surgery,<ref name=\"Harrisons\" /> which is often curative.<ref name=\":1\" /> In general, germ cell tumors can be treated with unilateral surgery unless the cancer is widespread or fertility is not a factor.<ref name=\":8\" /> In women with surgically staged advanced epithelial ovarian cancer (stages III and IV), studies suggest all attempts should be made to reach complete cytoreduction (surgical efforts to remove the bulk of the tumor).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Elattar|first=Ahmed|last2=Bryant|first2=Andrew|last3=Winter-Roach|first3=Brett A|last4=Hatem|first4=Mohamed|last5=Naik|first5=Raj|date=2011-08-10|title=Optimal primary surgical treatment for advanced epithelial ovarian cancer|journal=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|issue=8|pages=CD007565|doi=10.1002/14651858.cd007565.pub2|issn=1465-1858|pmc=6457688|pmid=21833960}}</ref>\n\nIn advanced cancers, where complete removal is not an option, as much tumor as possible is removed in a procedure called [[debulking]] surgery.

For stage I and II cancer, laparascopic (keyhole) surgery can be used, but metastases may not be found. For advanced cancer, laparoscopy is not used, since debulking metastases requires access to the entire peritoneal cavity. Depending on the extent of the cancer, procedures may include a bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, biopsies throughout the peritoneum and abdominal lymphatic system, [[omentectomy]], [[splenectomy]], [[bowel resection]], [[Diaphragm resection|diaphragm stripping or resection]], [[appendectomy]], or even a posterior [[pelvic exenteration]].<ref name=\"Hoffman35\" />\n\nTo fully stage ovarian cancer, [[lymphadenectomy]] can be included in the surgery, but a significant survival benefit to this practice may not happen.<ref name=Jayson/> This is particularly important in germ cell tumors because they frequently metastasize to nearby lymph nodes.<ref name=Harrisons/>\n\nIf ovarian cancer recurs, secondary surgery is sometimes a treatment option.

Interventions are available to help with the needs and social support. Many ovarian cancer survivors report a good quality of life and [[optimism]]. Others reported a \"spiritual change\" that helped them find [[Meaning of life|meaning]] during their experience. Others have described their loss of faith after their diagnosis with ovarian cancer.

It is disproportionately deadly because it lacks any clear early detection or screening test, meaning most cases are not diagnosed until they have reached advanced stages.<ref name=\"SGOfive\"/><ref name=Jayson/>\n\nOvarian cancer metastasizes early in its development, often before it has been diagnosed. High-grade tumors metastasize more readily than low-grade tumors. Typically, tumor cells begin to metastasize by growing in the peritoneal cavity.<ref name=Harrisons/> More than 60% of women presenting with ovarian cancer have stage-III or stage-IV cancer, when it has already spread beyond the ovaries. Ovarian cancers shed cells into the naturally occurring fluid within the abdominal cavity. These cells can then implant on other abdominal (peritoneal) structures, including the uterus, [[urinary bladder]], [[bowel]],  [[mesentery|lining of the bowel wall]], and [[Greater omentum|omentum]], forming new tumor growths before cancer is even suspected.\n\nThe five-year survival rate for all stages of ovarian cancer is 46%; the one-year survival rate is 72% and the ten-year survival rate is 35%.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Statistics and outlook for ovarian cancer|url = http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/type/ovarian-cancer/treatment/statistics-and-outlook-for-ovarian-cancer|website = www.cancerresearchuk.org|accessdate = 2015-05-16|url-status = live|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150518192429/http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/type/ovarian-cancer/treatment/statistics-and-outlook-for-ovarian-cancer|archivedate = 2015-05-18}}</ref> For cases where a diagnosis is made early in the disease, when the cancer is still confined to the primary site, the five-year survival rate is 92.7%.<ref name=\"SEER\">Survival rates based on SEER incidence and NCHS mortality statistics, as cited by the National Cancer Institute in [http://seer.cancer.gov/statfacts/html/ovary.html SEER Stat Fact Sheets&nbsp;\u2014 Cancer of the Ovary] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140706145616/http://seer.cancer.gov/statfacts/html/ovary.html |date=2014-07-06 }}</ref> About 70% of women with advanced disease respond to initial treatment, most of whom attain complete remission, but half of these women experience a recurrence 1\u20134 years after treatment.<ref name=Harrisons/> [[Brain metastasis]] is more common in stage III/IV cancer but can still occur in cancers staged at I/II. People with brain metastases survive a median of 8.2 months, though surgery, chemotherapy, and [[Whole brain radiotherapy|whole brain radiation therapy]] can improve survival.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\nOvarian cancer survival varies significantly with subtype. Dysgerminomas have a very favorable prognosis. In early stages, they have a five-year survival rate of 96.9%.<ref name=Current/> Around two-thirds of dysgerminomas are diagnosed at stage I.<ref name=\":8\" /> Stage-III dysgerminomas have a five-year survival of 61%; when treated with BEP chemotherapy after incomplete surgical removal, dysgerminomas have a 95% two-year survival rate. Sex-cord-stromal malignancies also have a favorable prognosis; because they are slow-growing, even those with metastatic disease can survive a decade or more.<ref name=Harrisons/> Low malignant potential tumors usually only have a bad prognosis when there are invasive tumor implants found in the peritoneal cavity.<ref name=Hoffman35/>\n\nComplications of ovarian cancer can include spread of the cancer to other organs, progressive function loss of various organs, ascites, and intestinal obstructions, which can be fatal. Intestinal obstructions in multiple sites are the most common proximate cause of death.<ref name=Jayson/> Intestinal obstruction in ovarian cancer can either be a true obstruction, where tumor blocks the [[intestinal lumen]], or a pseudo-obstruction, when tumor prevents normal [[peristalsis]].<ref>{{cite book |last1 = Gucalp |first1 = Rasim |last2 = Dutcher |first2 = Janice | name-list-format = vanc |chapter = Oncologic Emergencies |veditors = Longo DL, Kasper DL, Jameson JL, Fauci AS, Hauser SL, Loscalzo J |title = Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine |publisher = McGraw-Hill |year = 2012 |edition = 18th |isbn = 978-0-07-174889-6|title-link = Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine }}</ref> Continuous accumulation of ascites can be treated by placing a drain that can be self-drained.<ref name=Jayson/>\n\n=== Prognostic factors ===\nThere are a number of [[prognostic factor]]s in ovarian cancer. Positive prognostic factors - those indicating better chances of survival - include no residual disease after surgery (stage III/IV), complete macroscopic resection (stage IV), BRCA2 mutations, young age (under 45 years), nonserous type, low histologic grade, early stage, co-occurrence with endometrial cancer, and low CA-125 levels. There is conflicting evidence for BRCA1 as a prognostic factor. Conversely, negative prognostic factors - those that indicate a worse chance of survival - include rupture of the ovarian capsule during surgery, older age (over 45 years), mucinous type, stage IV, high histologic grade, clear cell type, upper abdominal involvement, high CA-125 levels, the presence of tumor cells in the blood, and elevated [[Cyclooxygenase 2|cyclooxygenase-2]].<ref name=\":7\" />\n\nExpression of various mRNAs can also be prognostic for ovarian cancer. High levels of [[Drosha]] and [[Dicer]] are associated with improved survival, whereas high levels of [[let-7b]], [[HIF1A]], [[EPH receptor A1|EphA1]], and [[Poly ADP ribose polymerase|poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase]] are associated with worse survival. Cancers that are positive for [[WT1]] carry a worse prognosis; estrogen-receptor positive cancers have a better prognosis.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\n=== Survival rates ===\nOverall five-year survival rates for all types of ovarian cancer are presented below by stage and histologic grade:<ref name=Harrisons/>\n{| class=\"wikitable\" align=\"left\" style=\"text-align: center; margin-right: 10px;\"\n!

Overall, in a 5-year period, 20% of stage I and II cancers recur. Most recurrences are in the abdomen.<ref name=\"Hoffman35\" /> If a recurrence occurs in advanced disease, it typically occurs within 18 months of initial treatment (18 months [[progression-free survival]]). Recurrences can be treated, but the disease-free interval tends to shorten and chemoresistance increases with each recurrence.<ref name=Jayson/> When a dysgerminoma recurs, it is most likely to recur within a year of diagnosis, and other malignant germ cell tumors recur within 2 years 90% of the time. Germ cell tumors other than dysgerminomas have a poor prognosis when they relapse, with a 10% long-term survival rate.<ref name=\":8\"/> Low malignant potential tumors rarely relapse, even when fertility-sparing surgery is the treatment of choice. 15% of LMP tumors relapse after unilateral surgery in the previously unaffected ovary, and they are typically easily treated with surgery. More advanced tumors may take up to 20 years to relapse, if they relapse at all, and are only treated with surgery unless the tumor has changed its histological characteristics or grown very quickly. In these cases, and when there is significant ascites, chemotherapy may also be used. Relapse is usually indicated by rising CA-125 levels and then progresses to symptomatic relapse within 2\u20136 months.<ref name=Hoffman35/> Recurrent sex cord-stromal tumors are typically unresponsive to treatment but not aggressive.<ref name=\":8\"/>\n\nIt is the most deadly gynecologic cancer.<ref name=\"Hoffman35\">{{cite book |chapter = Epithelial Ovarian Cancer |pages = 853\u2013878 |title = Williams Gynecology |edition = 2nd |publisher = McGraw Hill Medical |first1 = Barbara L. |last1 = Hoffman |first2 = John O. |last2 = Schorge |first3 = Joseph I. |last3 = Schaffer |first4 = Lisa M. |last4 = Halvorson |first5 = Karen D. |last5 = Bradshaw |first6 = F.

One major problem with screening is no clear progression of the disease from stage I (noninvasive) to stage III (invasive) is seen, and it may not be possible to find cancers before they reach stage III. Another problem is that screening methods tend to find too many suspicious lesions, most of which are not cancer, but malignancy can only be assessed with surgery.<ref name=Jayson/> The ROCA method combined with transvaginal ultrasonography is being researched in high-risk women to determine if it is a viable screening method. It is also being investigated in normal-risk women as it has shown promise in the wider population.<ref name=Hoffman35/> Studies are also in progress to determine if screening helps detect cancer earlier in people with BRCA mutations.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\n===Prognosis research===\nResearch into various [[prognostic factor]]s for ovarian cancer is also going on. Recent research shows that [[thrombocytosis]] predicts lower survival and higher stage cancer.<ref name=Jayson/> Ongoing research is also investigating the benefits of surgery for recurrent ovarian cancer.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\n===Immunotherapy===\nWhile an active area of research, as of 2018 there is no goodevidence that [[immunotherapy]] is effective for ovarian cancer.<ref name=\"pmid30199097\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Paijens ST, Leffers N, Daemen T, Helfrich W, Boezen HM, Cohlen BJ, Melief CJ, de Bruyn M, Nijman HW | title = Antigen-specific active immunotherapy for ovarian cancer | journal = Cochrane Database Syst Rev | volume = 9 | issue = | pages = CD007287 | date = September 2018 | pmid = 30199097 | pmc = 6513204 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD007287.pub4 }}</ref> However, trials of the antibody and [[VEGF]] inhibitor [[bevacizumab]], which can slow the [[angiogenesis|growth of new blood vessels]] in the cancer, have shown promising results, especially in combination with [[pazopanib]], which also slows the process of blood vessel growth. Bevacizumab has been particularly effective in preliminary studies on stage-III and -IV cancer<ref name=Jayson/> and has been cited as having at least a 15% response rate.<ref name=Harrisons/> It is being investigated particularly in mucinous ovarian cancers.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\n===Pharmacology===\n[[mTOR inhibitor]]s were a highly investigated potential treatment in the 2000s and 2010s, but the side effects of these drugs (particularly [[hyperglycemia]] and [[hyperlipidemia]]) were not well tolerated and the survival benefit not confirmed. PI3 kinase inhibitors have been of interest, but they tend to be highly toxic and cause [[diarrhea]]. Another investigated drug is [[selumetinib]], a [[MAPK]] inhibitor. It improved survival, but did not correlate with any mutations found in tumors.<ref name=Jayson/>\n\nBevacizumab can also be combined with platinum chemotherapy, a combination that has had positive preliminary results in PFS, but equivocal results regarding overall survival. One disadvantage to these treatments is the side effect profile, which includes [[hypertension|high blood pressure]] and [[proteinuria]]. The drug can also exacerbate bowel disease, leading to [[fistula]]e or [[bowel perforation]]. [[Vintafolide]], which consists of an [[antifolate]] conjugated with [[vinblastine]], is also in clinical trials; it may prove beneficial because [[folate receptor]]s are overexpressed in many ovarian cancers.<ref name=Jayson/> Another potential immunotherapy is [[trastuzumab]], which is active against tumors positive for Her2/neu mutations.<ref name=Harrisons/> Other angiogenesis inhibitors are also being investigated as potential ovarian cancer treatments. [[Combretastatin]] and [[pazopanib]] are being researched in combination for recurrent ovarian cancer. [[Trebananib]] and [[tasquinimod]] are other angiogenesis inhibitors being investigated. The [[monoclonal antibody]] [[farletuzumab]] is being researched as an adjuvant to traditional chemotherapy. Another type of immunotherapy involves [[vaccines]], including [[TroVax]].<ref name=\":6\" />\n\nAn alternative to BEP chemotherapy, a regimen of 3 cycles of [[carboplatin]] and [[etoposide]], is a current topic of research for germ cell malignancies.<ref name=\":8\" />\n\n[[Intraperitoneal chemotherapy]] has also been under investigation during the 2000s and 2010s for its potential to deliver higher doses of cytotoxic agent to tumors. Preliminary trials with cisplatin and paclitaxel have shown it is not well tolerated, but does improve survival, and more tolerable regimens are being researched.<ref name=Jayson/> Cisplatin and paclitaxel are both being researched as intraperitoneal chemotherapy agents. A specific chemotherapy regimen for rare clear-cell cancers is also under investigation: [[irinotecan]] combined with cisplatin.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\n[[PARP inhibitor]]s have also shown promise in early trials, particularly in people with ''BRCA'' gene mutations, since the BRCA protein interacts with the PARP pathway. It is also being studied in recurrent ovarian cancer in general, where preliminary studies have shown longer PFS. Specifically, [[olaparib]] has shown greater survival compared to doxorubicin, though this treatment is still being investigated. It is not clear yet which [[biomarker]]s are predictive of responsiveness to PARP inhibitors.<ref name=Jayson/> [[Rucaparib]] is another PARP inhibitor being researched in BRCA-positive and BRCA-negative recurrent advanced ovarian cancer. [[Niraparib]] is a PARP inhibitor being tested in BRCA-positive recurrent ovarian cancer.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\n[[Tyrosine kinase inhibitors]] are another investigational drug class that may have applications in ovarian cancer. Angiogenesis inhibitors in the [[receptor tyrosine kinase]] inhibitor group, including [[pazopanib]], [[cediranib]], and [[nintedanib]], have also been shown to increase progression free survival (PFS), but their benefit for overall survival has not been investigated as of 2015.<ref name=\"Jayson\" /> Preliminary research showed that cediranib combined with platins in recurrent ovarian cancer increased the time to second recurrence by 3\u20134 months and increased survival by 3 months.<ref name=\":6\" /> [[MK-1775]] is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor that is being used in combination with paclitaxel and carboplatin in platinum-sensitive cancers with p53 mutations. [[Nintedanib]] is being researched as a potential therapy in combination with cyclophosphamide for people with recurrences.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\n[[Histone deacetylase inhibitor]]s (HDACi) are another area of research.\n\n===Hormones and radiation===\nHormone therapies are a topic of current research in ovarian cancer, particularly, the value of certain medications used to treat breast cancer. These include [[tamoxifen]], [[letrozole]], and [[anastrozole]]. Preliminary studies have showed a benefit for tamoxifen in a small number of people with advanced ovarian cancer. Letrozole may help to slow or stop growth of [[estrogen receptor]] positive ovarian cancer. Anastrozole is being investigated in postmenopausal people with estrogen receptor-positive cancer.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\nResearch into mitigating side effects of ovarian cancer treatment is also ongoing. [[Radiation fibrosis]], the formation of scar tissue in an area treated with radiation, may be relieved with [[Hyperbaric medicine|hyperbaric oxygen therapy]], but research has not been completed in this area. Treatment of ovarian cancer may also cause people to experience psychiatric difficulties, including [[Depression (mood)|depression]]. Research is ongoing to determine how counseling and psychotherapy can help people who have ovarian cancer during treatment.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\n===Inflammation===\n\nThere are some indications that pelvic inflammatory disease may be associated with ovarian cancer, especially in non-western countries.

Thus [[Nulliparity|not having children]] is a risk factor for ovarian cancer, likely because ovulation is suppressed via pregnancy.  During ovulation, cells are constantly stimulated to divide while ovulatory cycles continue. Therefore, [[Nulliparity|people who have not borne children]] are at twice the risk of ovarian cancer than those who have.

The risk of developing ovarian cancer is reduced in women who have had [[tubal ligation]] (colloquially known as having one's \"tubes tied\"), both ovaries removed, or [[hysterectomy]] (an operation in which the uterus, and sometimes the cervix, is removed).<ref name=\"CDCsep2016\" /> Age is also a risk factor.<ref name = Harrisons/><ref name=\"Gib2016\"/>\n\n=== Hormones ===\nUse of fertility medication may contribute to ovarian [[borderline tumor]] formation, but the link between the two is disputed and difficult to study.<ref name=Jayson/> Fertility drugs may be associated with a higher risk of borderline tumors.<ref name=\":7\" /> Those who have been treated for infertility but remain nulliparous are at higher risk for epithelial ovarian cancer; however, those who are successfully treated for infertility and subsequently give birth are at no higher risk.

People with [[hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer]] (Lynch syndrome), and those with BRCA-1 and BRCA-2 genetic abnormalities are at increased risk.\n\nThe major genetic risk factor for ovarian cancer is a mutation in ''BRCA1'' or ''BRCA2'' genes, or in [[DNA mismatch repair]] genes, which is present in 10% of ovarian cancer cases. Only one [[allele]] need be mutated to place a person at high risk. The gene can be inherited through either the maternal or paternal line, but has variable [[penetrance]].<ref name=Harrisons/><ref name=Hoffman35/> Though mutations in these genes are usually associated with increased risk of breast cancer, they also carry a substantial lifetime risk of ovarian cancer, a risk that peaks in a person's 40s and 50s.

However, it may not detect smaller tumors. Sometimes, a [[Chest radiograph|chest x-ray]] is used to detect metastases in the chest or [[pleural effusion]]. Another test for metastatic disease, though it is infrequently used, is a [[barium enema]], which can show if the rectosigmoid colon is involved in the disease.

[[Vaginal ultrasonography]] is often the first-line imaging study performed when an adnexal mass is found. Several characteristics of an adnexal mass indicate ovarian malignancy; they usually are solid, irregular, multilocular, and/or large; and they typically have papillary features, central vessels, and/or irregular internal septations.<ref name=\":7\" /> However, SCST has no definitive characteristics on radiographic study.<ref name=\":8\" />\n\nTo definitively diagnose ovarian cancer, a surgical procedure to inspect the abdomen is required.

Epithelial ovarian cancers develop from the [[epithelium]], a layer of cells that covers the ovary.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|title = Types of ovarian cancer|url = http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/type/ovarian-cancer/about/types-of-ovarian-cancer|website = www.cancerresearchuk.org|accessdate = 2015-05-16|url-status = live|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150518091024/http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/type/ovarian-cancer/about/types-of-ovarian-cancer|archivedate = 2015-05-18}}</ref>\n\n===== Serous carcinoma =====\nMost people with epithelial ovarian carcinoma, about two-thirds, have a [[serous carcinoma]],<ref name=Jayson/> though this proportion is estimated as high as 80%.<ref name=\":7\">{{Cite web|url = http://www.dynamed.com/topics/dmp~AN~T900705/Ovarian-cancer|title = Ovarian cancer|date = June 18, 2015|publisher = DynaMed|url-access=subscription |url-status = live|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150621210904/http://www.dynamed.com/topics/dmp~AN~T900705/Ovarian-cancer|archivedate = June 21, 2015}}</ref><ref name=Levy/> Low-grade serous carcinoma is less aggressive than high-grade serous carcinomas, though it does not typically respond well to chemotherapy or hormonal treatments.<ref name=Jayson/> Serous carcinomas are thought to begin in the [[Fallopian tube]].<ref name=\":1\" /> Histologically, serous adenocarcinomas have [[Psammoma body|psammoma bodies]]. Low-grade serous adenocarcinomas resemble Fallopian tube epithelium, whereas high-grade serous adenocarcinomas show [[anaplasia]] and [[nuclear atypia]].<ref name=\"Hoffman35\" />\n\n50% of the time, serous carcinomas are bilateral, and in 85% of cases, they have spread beyond the ovary at the time of diagnosis. Most have a diameter over 15&nbsp;cm.<ref name=\"Levy\" />\n\n===== Small-cell carcinoma =====\n[[Small-cell carcinoma|Small-cell]] ovarian carcinoma is rare and aggressive, with two main subtypes: hypercalcemic and pulmonary. It is typically fatal within 2 years of diagnosis. Hypercalcemic small cell ovarian carcinoma overwhelmingly affects those in their 20s, causes [[Hypercalcaemia|high blood calcium levels]], and affects one ovary. Pulmonary small cell ovarian cancer usually affects both ovaries of older women and looks like [[Small-cell carcinoma|oat-cell carcinoma of the lung]].<ref name=\"Hoffman35\" />\n\n====== Primary peritoneal carcinoma ======\n{{Main|Primary peritoneal carcinoma}}Primary peritoneal carcinomas develop from the [[peritoneum]], a membrane that covers the [[abdominal cavity]] that has the same embryonic origin as the ovary. They are often discussed and classified with ovarian cancers when they affect the ovary.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref>{{Cite web|title = Primary peritoneal carcinoma|url = http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/type/rare-cancers/rare-cancers-name/primary-peritoneal-carcinoma|website = www.cancerresearchuk.org|accessdate = 2015-05-16|url-status = live|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150520031318/http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/type/rare-cancers/rare-cancers-name/primary-peritoneal-carcinoma|archivedate = 2015-05-20}}</ref> They can develop even after the ovaries have been removed and may appear similar to [[mesothelioma]].<ref name=\"Hoffman35\" />\n\n===== Clear-cell carcinoma =====\n[[Clear-cell ovarian carcinoma]]s do not typically respond well to chemotherapy and may be related to endometriosis.<ref name=Jayson/> They represent approximately 5% of all endometrial cancers. Japanese women develop clear-cell ovarian cancer more frequently than other groups of women.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\n===== Clear-cell adenocarcinoma =====\n[[File:Clear cell carcinoma hobnail cells.png|thumb|upright=1.3|Hobnail cells seen in a clear cell carcinoma sample]]\n\nClear-cell adenocarcinomas are histopathologically similar to other [[clear cell carcinoma]]s, with [[clear cell]]s and [[hobnail cell]]s. They represent approximately 5\u201310% of epithelial ovarian cancers and are associated with endometriosis in the pelvic cavity. They are typically early-stage and therefore curable by surgery, but advanced clear-cell adenocarcinomas (approximately 20%) have a poor prognosis and are often resistant to platinum chemotherapy.<ref name=\"Hoffman35\" />\n\n===== Endometrioid =====\nEndometrioid adenocarcinomas make up approximately 15\u201320% of epithelial ovarian cancers. Because they are typically low-grade, endometrioid adenocarcinomas have a good prognosis. These tumors frequently co-occur with [[endometriosis]] or endometrial cancer.<ref name=\"Hoffman35\" />\n\n====== Malignant mixed m\u00fcllerian tumor (carcinosarcoma) ======\nMixed m\u00fcllerian tumors make up less than 1% of ovarian cancer. They have epithelial and mesenchymal cells visible and tend to have a poor prognosis.<ref name=\"Hoffman35\" />\n\n===== Mucinous =====\nMucinous tumors include mucinous adenocarcinoma and mucinous cystadenocarcinoma.<ref name=\"Hoffman35\" />\n\n====== Mucinous adenocarcinoma ======\n{{Main|Mucinous adenocarcinoma}}\n\nMucinous adenocarcinomas make up 5\u201310% of epithelial ovarian cancers. Histologically, they are similar to intestinal or cervical adenocarcinomas and are often actually metastases of [[appendiceal cancer|appendiceal]] or [[colon cancer]]s. Advanced mucinous adenocarcinomas have a poor prognosis, generally worse than serous tumors, and are often resistant to platinum chemotherapy, though they are rare.<ref name=\"Hoffman35\" />\n\n====== Pseudomyxoma peritonei ======\n{{Main|Pseudomyxoma peritonei}}\n\n''Pseudomyxoma peritonei'' refers to a collection of encapsulated mucous or gelatinous material in the abdominopelvic cavity, which is very rarely caused by a primary mucinous ovarian tumor. More commonly, it is associated with ovarian metastases of intestinal cancer.<ref name=\"Hoffman35\" />\n\n===== Undifferentiated epithelial =====\nUndifferentiated cancers - those where the cell type cannot be determined - make up about 10% of epithelial ovarian cancers and have a comparatively poor prognosis.<ref name=\"Hoffman35\" /><ref name=\":1\" /> When examined under the microscope, these tumors have very abnormal cells that are arranged in clumps or sheets. Usually there are recognizable clumps of serous cells inside the tumor.<ref name=\"Hoffman35\" />\n\n====== Malignant Brenner tumor ======\n{{Main|Brenner tumor}}\n\nMalignant Brenner tumors are rare. Histologically, they have dense fibrous stroma with areas of transitional epithelium, and some squamous differentiation. To be classified as a malignant Brenner tumor, it must have Brenner tumor foci and transitional cell carcinoma. The transitional cell carcinoma component is typically poorly differentiated and resembles urinary tract cancer.<ref name=\"Hoffman35\" />\n\n====== Transitional cell carcinoma ======\n{{Main|Transitional cell carcinoma}}\n\nTransitional cell carcinomas represent less than 5% of ovarian cancers. Histologically, they appear similar to [[bladder carcinoma]]. The prognosis is intermediate - better than most epithelial cancers but worse than malignant Brenner tumors.<ref name=\"Hoffman35\" />\n\n==== Sex cord-stromal tumor ====\n{{Main|Sex cord-stromal tumor}}\n\n[[Sex cord-stromal tumour|Sex cord-stromal tumor]], including [[estrogen]]-producing [[granulosa cell tumor]], the benign [[thecoma]], and virilizing [[Sertoli-Leydig cell tumor]] or [[arrhenoblastoma]], accounts for 7% of ovarian cancers. They occur most frequently in women between 50 and 69 years of age but can occur in women of any age, including young girls. They are not typically aggressive and are usually unilateral;<ref name=Harrisons/> they are therefore usually treated with surgery alone. Sex cord-stromal tumors are the main hormone-producing ovarian tumors.<ref name=\":8\">{{harvnb|Williams Gynecology|2012}}</ref>\n\nSeveral different cells from the [[mesenchyme]] can give rise to sex-cord or stromal tumors. These include [[fibroblast]]s and endocrine cells. The symptoms of a sex-cord or stromal ovarian tumor can differ from other types of ovarian cancer. Common signs and symptoms include [[ovarian torsion]], [[hemorrhage]] from or rupture of the tumor, an abdominal mass, and hormonal disruption. In children, [[precocious puberty#Isosexual and heterosexual|isosexual precocious pseudopuberty]] may occur with granulosa cell tumors since they produce estrogen. These tumors cause abnormalities in menstruation ([[menometrorrhagia|excessive bleeding]], [[oligomenorrhea|infrequent menstruation]], or [[amenorrhea|no menstruation]]) or postmenopausal bleeding. Because these tumors produce estrogen, they can cause or occur at the same time as [[endometrial cancer]] or [[breast cancer]]. Other sex-cord/stromal tumors present with distinct symptoms. Sertoli-Leydig cell tumors cause [[virilization]] and [[hirsutism|excessive hair growth]] due to the production of [[testosterone]] and [[androstenedione]], which can also cause [[Cushing's syndrome]] in rare cases. Also, sex-cord stromal tumors occur that do not cause a hormonal imbalance, including benign fibromas, which cause ascites and [[hydrothorax]].<ref name=Harrisons/> With germ cell tumors, sex cord-stromal tumors are the most common ovarian cancer diagnosed in women under 20.<ref name=\":8\"/>\n\n===== Granulosa cell tumor =====\nGranulosa cell tumors are the most common sex-cord stromal tumors, making up 70% of cases, and are divided into two histologic subtypes: adult granulosa cell tumors, which develop in women over 50, and juvenile granulosa tumors, which develop before puberty or before the age of 30. Both develop in the [[ovarian follicle]] from a population of cells that surrounds [[germinal cell]]s.<ref name=\":8\" />\n\n====== Adult granulosa cell tumor ======\nAdult granulosa cell tumors are characterized by later onset (30+ years, 50 on average). These tumors produce high levels of estrogen, which causes its characteristic symptoms: [[menometrorrhagia]]; [[endometrial hyperplasia]]; [[Breast pain|tender]], [[Breast enlargement|enlarged breasts]]; [[Vaginal bleeding|postmenopausal bleeding]]; and [[Amenorrhoea|secondary amenorrhea]]. The mass of the tumor can cause other symptoms, including abdominal pain and distension, or symptoms similar to an [[ectopic pregnancy]] if the tumor bleeds and ruptures.<ref name=\":8\" />\n\n====== Juvenile granulosa cell tumor ======\n\n===== Sertoli-Leydig cell tumor =====\nSertoli-Leydig tumors are most common in women before the age of 30, and particularly common before puberty.<ref name=\":8\" />\n\n===== Sclerosing stromal tumors =====\nSclerosing stromal tumors  typically occur in girls before puberty or women before the age of 30.<ref name=\":8\" />\n\n==== Germ cell tumor ====\n{{Main|Ovarian germ cell tumors}}\nGerm cell tumors of the ovary develop from the ovarian [[germ cells]].<ref name=\":1\" /> [[Germ cell tumor]] accounts for about 30% of ovarian tumors, but only 5% of ovarian cancers, because most germ-cell tumors are [[teratoma]]s and most teratomas are benign. Malignant teratomas tend to occur in older women, when one of the germ layers in the tumor develops into a [[squamous cell carcinoma]].<ref name=Harrisons/> Germ-cell tumors tend to occur in young women (20s\u201330s) and girls, making up 70% of the ovarian cancer seen in that age group.<ref name=Current>{{cite book |chapter = Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology |title = Current Diagnosis & Treatment Obstetrics & Gynecology |isbn = 978-0071638562  |edition = 11th |year = 2012 |first1 = Alan |last1 = DeCherney |first2 = Lauren |last2 = Nathan  |first3 = T. Murphy |last3 = Goodwin |first4 = Neri |last4 = Laufer |first5 = Ashley |last5 = Roman | name-list-format = vanc }}</ref> Germ-cell tumors can include dysgerminomas, teratomas, yolk sac tumors/endodermal sinus tumors, and choriocarcinomas, when they arise in the ovary. Some germ-cell tumors have an [[isochromosome]] 12, where one arm of chromosome 12 is deleted and replaced with a duplicate of the other.<ref name=Harrisons/> Most germ-cell cancers have a better prognosis than other subtypes and are more sensitive to chemotherapy. They are more likely to be stage I at diagnosis.<ref name=\":8\" /> Overall, they metastasize more frequently than epithelial ovarian cancers. In addition, the cancer markers used vary with tumor type: [[choriocarcinomas]] are monitored with [[beta-HCG]] and endodermal sinus tumors with [[alpha-fetoprotein]].<ref name=Harrisons/>\n\nGerm-cell tumors are typically discovered when they become large, palpable masses. However, like sex cord tumors, they can cause ovarian torsion or hemorrhage and, in children, isosexual precocious puberty. They frequently metastasize to nearby lymph nodes, especially para-aortic and pelvic lymph nodes.<ref name=Harrisons/> The most common symptom of germ cell tumors is [[Abdominal pain|subacute abdominal pain]] caused by the tumor bleeding, [[Necrosis|necrotizing]], or stretching the [[ovarian capsule]]. If the tumor ruptures, causes significant bleeding, or torses the ovary, it can cause [[Acute abdomen|acute abdominal pain]], which occurs in less than 10% of those with germ-cell tumors. They can also secrete hormones which change the [[menstrual cycle]]. In 25% of germ-cell tumors, the cancer is discovered during a [[Well-woman examination|routine examination]] and does not cause symptoms.<ref name=\":8\" />\n\nDiagnosing germ cell tumors may be difficult because the normal menstrual cycle and [[puberty]] can cause pain and pelvic symptoms, and a young woman may even believe these symptoms to be those of pregnancy, and not seek treatment due to the stigma of [[Teenage pregnancy|teen pregnancy]]. Blood tests for alpha-fetoprotein, [[karyotype]], human chorionic gonadotropin, and liver function are used to diagnose germ cell tumor and potential co-occurring gonadal dysgenesis. A germ cell tumor may be initially mistaken for a benign [[ovarian cyst]].<ref name=\":8\" />\n\n===== Dysgerminoma =====\n{{Main|Dysgerminoma}}\nDysgerminoma accounts for 35% of ovarian cancer in young women and is the most likely germ cell tumor to metastasize to the lymph nodes; nodal metastases occur in 25\u201330% of cases.<ref name=Current/><ref name=\":8\" /> These tumors may have mutations in [[CD117|the ''KIT'' gene]], a mutation known for its role in [[gastrointestinal stromal tumor]]. [[Swyer syndrome|People with an XY karyotype and ovaries]] ([[gonadal dysgenesis]]) or an X,0 karyotype and ovaries ([[Turner syndrome]]) who develop a unilateral dysgerminoma are at risk for a [[gonadoblastoma]] in the other ovary, and in this case, both ovaries are usually removed when a unilateral dysgerminoma is discovered to avoid the risk of another malignant tumor. Gonadoblastomas in people with Swyer or Turner syndrome become malignant in approximately 40% of cases. However, in general, dysgerminomas are bilateral 10\u201320% of the time.<ref name=Harrisons/><ref name=\":8\" />\n\nThey are composed of cells that cannot [[Cellular differentiation|differentiate]] further and develop directly from germ cells or from gonadoblastomas. Dysgerminomas contain [[syncytiotrophoblast]]s in approximately 5% of cases, and can therefore cause elevated hCG levels. On gross appearance, dysgerminomas are typically pink to tan-colored, have multiple lobes, and are solid. Microscopically, they appear identical to [[seminoma]]s and very close to [[Embryonic germ cell|embryonic primordial germ cells]], having large, polyhedral, rounded [[clear cell]]s. The nuclei are uniform and round or square with prominent [[Nucleolus|nucleoli]] and the [[cytoplasm]] has high levels of [[glycogen]]. Inflammation is another prominent histologic feature of dysgerminomas.<ref name=\":8\" />\n\n===== Choriocarcinoma =====\n{{Main|Choriocarcinoma}}\nChoriocarcinoma can occur as a primary ovarian tumor developing from a germ cell, though it is usually a gestational disease that metastasizes to the ovary. Primary ovarian choriocarcinoma has  a poor prognosis and can occur without a pregnancy. They produce high levels of hCG and can cause [[Precocious puberty|early puberty]] in children or [[menometrorrhagia]] (irregular, heavy menstruation) after menarche.<ref name=\":8\" />\n\n===== Immature (solid) teratoma =====\n{{Main|Immature teratoma}}Immature, or solid, teratomas are the most common type of ovarian germ cell tumor, making up 40\u201350% of cases. Teratomas are characterized by the presence of disorganized tissues arising from all three embryonic [[germ layer]]s: [[ectoderm]], [[mesoderm]], and [[endoderm]]; immature teratomas also have undifferentiated [[stem cell]]s that make them more malignant than mature teratomas (dermoid cysts). The different tissues are visible on gross pathology and often include bone, cartilage, hair, [[mucus]], or [[Sebaceous gland|sebum]], but these tissues are not visible from the outside, which appears to be a solid mass with lobes and cysts. Histologically, they have large amounts of [[neuroectoderm]] organized into sheets and tubules along with [[Neuroglia|glia]]; the amount of neural tissue determines the histologic grade. Immature teratomas usually only affect one ovary (10% co-occur with dermoid cysts) and usually metastasize throughout the peritoneum. They can also cause mature teratoma implants to grow throughout the abdomen in a disease called [[growing teratoma syndrome]]; these are usually benign but will continue to grow during chemotherapy, and often necessitate further surgery. Unlike mature teratomas, immature teratomas form many [[Adhesion (medicine)|adhesions]], making them less likely to cause ovarian torsion. There is no specific marker for immature teratomas, but [[carcinoembryonic antigen]] (CEA), CA-125, CA19-9, or AFP can sometimes indicate an immature teratoma.<ref name=\":8\" />\n\nStage I teratomas make up the majority (75%) of cases and have the best prognosis, with 98% of patients surviving 5 years; if a Stage I tumor is also grade 1, it can be treated with unilateral surgery only. Stage II though IV tumors make up the remaining quarter of cases and have a worse prognosis,  with 73\u201388% of patients surviving 5 years.<ref name=\":8\" />\n\n===== Mature teratoma (dermoid cyst) =====\n{{Main|Dermoid cyst}}\nMature teratomas, or dermoid cysts, are rare tumors consisting of mostly benign tissue that develop after menopause. The tumors consist of disorganized tissue with nodules of malignant tissue, which can be of various types. The most common malignancy is [[Squamous-cell carcinoma|squamous cell carcinoma]], but [[adenocarcinoma]], [[basal-cell carcinoma]], [[Carcinoid|carcinoid tumor]], [[neuroectodermal tumor]], [[Melanoma|malignant melanoma]], [[sarcoma]], [[Sebaceous carcinoma|sebaceous tumor]], and [[struma ovarii]] can also be part of the dermoid cyst. They are treated with surgery and adjuvant platinum chemotherapy or radiation.<ref name=\":8\" />\n\n===== Yolk sac tumor/endodermal sinus tumor =====\n{{Main|Yolk sac tumor}}\n[[Yolk sac]] tumors, formerly called endodermal sinus tumors, make up approximately 10\u201320% of ovarian germ cell malignancies, and have the worst prognosis of all [[ovarian germ cell tumors]]. They occur both before menarche (in one-third of cases) and after menarche (the remaining two-thirds of cases). Half of the people with yolk sac tumors are diagnosed in stage I. Typically, they are unilateral until metastasis, which occurs within the peritoneal cavity and via the bloodstream to the lungs. Yolk sac tumors grow quickly and recur easily, and are not easily treatable once they have recurred. Stage I yolk sac tumors are highly treatable, with a 5-year disease-free survival rate of 93%, but stage II-IV tumors are less treatable, with survival rates of 64\u201391%.<ref name=\":8\" />\n\nTheir gross appearance is solid, friable, and yellow, with necrotic and hemorrhagic areas. They also often contain cysts that can degenerate or rupture. Histologically, yolk sac tumors are characterized by the presence of [[Schiller\u2013Duval body|Schiller-Duval bodies]] (which are pathognomonic for yolk sac tumors) and a reticular pattern. Yolk sac tumors commonly secrete [[alpha-fetoprotein]] and can be [[Immunohistochemistry|immunohistochemically]] stained for its presence; the level of alpha-fetoprotein in the blood is a useful marker of recurrence.<ref name=\":8\" />\n\n===== Embryonal carcinoma =====\n{{Main|Embryonal carcinoma}}\nEmbryonal carcinomas, a rare tumor type usually found in mixed tumors, develop directly from germ cells but are not terminally differentiated; in rare cases they may develop in dysgenetic gonads. They can develop further into a variety of other neoplasms, including choriocarcinoma, yolk sac tumor, and teratoma. They occur in younger people, with an average age at diagnosis of 14, and secrete both alpha-fetoprotein (in 75% of cases) and hCG.<ref name=\":8\" />\n\nHistologically, embryonal carcinoma appears similar to the [[embryonic disc]], made up of epithelial, [[Anaplasia|anaplastic]] cells in disorganized sheets, with gland-like spaces and papillary structures.<ref name=\":8\" />\n\n===== Polyembryoma =====\n{{Main|Polyembryoma}}\nPolyembryomas, the most immature form of teratoma and very rare ovarian tumors, are histologically characterized by having several [[embryo]]-like bodies with structures resembling a [[germ disk]], [[yolk sac]], and [[amniotic sac]]. [[Syncytiotrophoblast|Syncytiotrophoblast giant cells]] also occur in polyembryomas.<ref name=\":8\" />\n\n==== Squamous cell carcinoma ====\nPrimary ovarian squamous cell carcinomas are rare and have a poor prognosis when advanced. More typically, ovarian squamous cell carcinomas are cervical metastases, areas of differentiation in an endometrioid tumor, or derived from a mature teratoma.<ref name=\"Hoffman35\" />\n\n==== Mixed tumors ====\nMixed tumors contain elements of more than one of the above classes of tumor histology. To be classed as a mixed tumor, the minor type must make up more than 10% of the tumor.<ref name=\":7\" /> Though mixed carcinomas can have any combination of cell types, mixed ovarian cancers are typically serous/endometrioid or clear cell/endometrioid.<ref name=\"Hoffman35\" /> Mixed germ cell tumors make up approximately 25\u201330% of all germ cell ovarian cancers, with combinations of dysgerminoma, yolk sac tumor, and/or immature teratoma. The prognosis and treatment vary based on the component cell types.<ref name=\":8\" />\n\n==== Secondary ovarian cancer ====\nOvarian cancer can also be a secondary cancer, the result of [[metastasis]] from a primary cancer elsewhere in the body.<ref name=Harrisons/> About 7% of ovarian cancers are due to metastases, while the rest are primary cancers.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} Common primary cancers are [[breast cancer]], [[colon cancer]], [[appendiceal cancer]], and [[stomach cancer]] (primary gastric cancers that metastasize to the ovary are called [[Krukenberg tumor]]s).<ref name=Harrisons/> Krukenberg tumors have signet ring cells and mucinous cells.<ref name=\"Hoffman35\" /> Endometrial cancer and lymphomas can also metastasize to the ovary.<ref name=Levy>{{Cite book|title = Premalignant & Malignant Disorders of the Ovaries & Oviducts|last = Levy|first = Gary | name-list-format = vanc |publisher = McGraw-Hill|year = 2013|last2 = Purcell|last3 = Karen|work = CURRENT Diagnosis & Treatment: Obstetrics & Gynecology, 11e| veditors = DeCherney AH, Nathan L, Laufer N, Roman AS |url = http://accessmedicine.mhmedical.com/content.aspx?bookid=498&sectionid=41008645|isbn = 978-0-07-163856-2|url-status = live|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170910175639/http://accessmedicine.mhmedical.com/content.aspx?bookid=498&sectionid=41008645|archivedate = 2017-09-10}}</ref>\n\n==== Borderline tumors====\nOvarian [[borderline tumor]]s, sometimes called low malignant potential (LMP) ovarian tumors, have some benign and some malignant features.<ref name=\"Hoffman35\" /> LMP tumors make up approximately 10%-15% of all ovarian tumors.<ref name=\":7\" /><ref name=\":1\" /> They develop earlier than epithelial ovarian cancer, around the age of 40\u201349. They typically do not have extensive invasion; 10% of LMP tumors have areas of stromal microinvasion (<3mm, <5% of tumor). LMP tumors have other abnormal features, including increased mitosis, [[pleomorphism (cytology)|changes in cell size or nucleus size]], [[nuclear atypia|abnormal nuclei]], cell stratification, and [[papillary projections|small projections on cells]] (papillary projections). Serous and/or mucinous characteristics can be seen on histological examination, and serous histology makes up the overwhelming majority of advanced LMP tumors. More than 80% of LMP tumors are Stage I; 15% are stage II and III and less than 5% are stage IV.<ref name=Hoffman35/> Implants of LMP tumors are often non-invasive.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Staging ===\nOvarian cancer is staged using the [[International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics|FIGO]] staging system and uses information obtained after surgery, which can include a total [[Hysterectomy|abdominal hysterectomy]] via [[Laparotomy|midline laparotomy]], [[Salpingoophorectomy|removal of (usually) both ovaries and Fallopian tubes]], [[Omentectomy|(usually) the omentum]], [[pelvic washing|pelvic (peritoneal) washing]]s, assessment of [[Retroperitoneal lymph node dissection|retroperitoneal lymph nodes]] (including the [[Pelvic lymph nodes|pelvic]] and [[Paraaortic lymph node|para-aortic lymph nodes]]), [[appendectomy]] in suspected mucinous tumors, and pelvic/peritoneal biopsies for [[cytopathology]].<ref name=Jayson/><ref name=Harrisons/><ref name=\":7\" /><ref name=SGO/> Around 30% of ovarian cancers that appear confined to the ovary have metastasized microscopically, which is why even stage-I cancers must be staged completely.<ref name=Harrisons/> 22% of cancers presumed to be stage I are observed to have lymphatic metastases.<ref name=\":7\" /> The AJCC stage is the same as the FIGO stage.

Ovarian cancer metastases usually grow on the surface of organs rather than the inside; they are also common on the omentum and the peritoneal lining. Cancer cells can also travel through the [[lymphatic system]] and metastasize to lymph nodes connected to the ovaries via blood vessels; i.e. the lymph nodes along the [[Suspensory ligament of ovary|infundibulopelvic ligament]], the [[Broad ligament of the uterus|broad ligament]], and the [[Round ligament of uterus|round ligament]]. The most commonly affected groups include the [[paraaortic lymph node|paraaortic]], [[hypogastric lymph node|hypogastric]], [[external iliac lymph nodes|external iliac]], [[obturator lymph nodes|obturator]], and [[inguinal lymph node]]s. Usually, ovarian cancer does not metastasize to the liver, lung, brain, or kidneys unless it is recurrent disease; this differentiates ovarian cancer from many other forms of cancer.<ref name=\"Hoffman35\" />\n\n== Screening ==\nThere is no simple and reliable way to test for ovarian cancer in women who do not have any signs or symptoms. Screening is not recommended in women who are at average risk, as evidence does not support a reduction in death and the high rate of false positive tests may lead to unneeded surgery, which is accompanied by its own risks.<ref name=Gros2018/> The [[Pap test]] does not screen for ovarian cancer.<ref name = CDCsep2016/>\n\nOvarian cancer is usually only palpable in advanced stages.<ref name=Hoffman35/>  Screening is not recommended using [[CA-125]] measurements, [[HE4]] levels, ultrasound, or adnexal palpation in women who are at average risk.

Because ambiguous results are more likely than detection of a treatable problem, and because the usual response to ambiguous results is invasive interventions, in women of average risk, the potential harms of having screening without an indication outweigh the potential benefits. The purpose of screening is to diagnose ovarian cancer at an early stage, when it is more likely to be treated successfully.<ref name=Harrisons/><ref name=Harrisons82/>\n\nScreening with [[transvaginal ultrasound]], pelvic examination, and CA-125 levels can be used instead of preventive surgery in women who have BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations. This strategy has shown some success.<ref name=Hoffman35/>\n\n== Prevention==\nPeople with strong genetic risk for ovarian cancer may consider the surgical removal of their ovaries as a preventive measure. This is often done after completion of childbearing years. This reduces the chances of developing both breast cancer (by around 50%) and ovarian cancer (by about 96%) in people at high risk. Women with ''BRCA'' gene mutations usually also have their Fallopian tubes removed at the same time (salpingo-oophorectomy), since they also have an increased risk of [[Fallopian tube cancer]]. However, these statistics may overestimate the risk reduction because of how they have been studied.<ref name=Harrisons/><ref name=Harrisons82/>\n\nPeople with a significant family history for ovarian cancer are often referred to a [[genetic counselor]] to see if  testing for BRCA mutations would be beneficial.<ref name=Hoffman35/> The use of oral contraceptives, the absence of 'periods' during the menstrual cycle, and tubal ligation reduce the risk.<ref name=\"CibulaWidschwendter2010\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Cibula D, Widschwendter M, M\u00e1jek O, Dusek L | title = Tubal ligation and the risk of ovarian cancer: review and meta-analysis | journal = Human Reproduction Update | volume = 17 | issue = 1 | pages = 55\u201367 | year = 2010 | pmid = 20634209 | doi = 10.1093/humupd/dmq030 | doi-access = free }}</ref>\nThere may an association of developing ovarian cancer and ovarian stimulation during infertility treatments.

The surgery depends upon the extent of nearby invasion of other tissues by the cancer when it is diagnosed. This extent of the cancer is described by assigning it a stage, the presumed type, and the grade of cancer. The gynecological surgeon may  remove one (unilateral oophorectomy) or both ovaries (bilateral oophorectomy). The Fallopian tubes (salpingectomy), uterus (hysterectomy), and the [[Greater omentum|omentum]] (omentectomy) may also be removed. Typically, all of these organs are removed.<ref name=\"CanadianCS2017\" />\n\nFor low-grade, unilateral stage-IA cancers, only the involved ovary (which must be unruptured) and Fallopian tube will be removed. This can be done especially in young people who wish to preserve their fertility. However, a risk of microscopic metastases exists and staging must be completed.<ref name=\"Jayson\" /> If any metastases are found, a second surgery to remove the remaining ovary and uterus is needed.<ref name=\":2\" /> [[Tranexamic acid]] can be administered prior to surgery to reduce the need for blood transfusions due to blood loss during the surgery.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\nIf a tumor in a premenopausal woman is determined to be a low malignant potential tumor during surgery, and it is clearly stage I cancer, only the affected ovary is removed. For postmenopausal women with low malignant potential tumors, hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy is still the preferred option. During staging, the appendix can be examined or removed. This is particularly important with mucinous tumors.<ref name=\"Hoffman35\" /> In children or adolescents with ovarian cancer, surgeons typically attempt to preserve one ovary to allow for the completion of [[puberty]], but if the cancer has spread, this is not always possible. Dysgerminomas, in particular, tend to affect both ovaries: 8\u201315% of dysgerminomas are present in both ovaries.<ref name=\"Current\" /> People with low-grade (well-differentiated) tumors are typically treated only with surgery,<ref name=\"Harrisons\" /> which is often curative.<ref name=\":1\" /> In general, germ cell tumors can be treated with unilateral surgery unless the cancer is widespread or fertility is not a factor.<ref name=\":8\" /> In women with surgically staged advanced epithelial ovarian cancer (stages III and IV), studies suggest all attempts should be made to reach complete cytoreduction (surgical efforts to remove the bulk of the tumor).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Elattar|first=Ahmed|last2=Bryant|first2=Andrew|last3=Winter-Roach|first3=Brett A|last4=Hatem|first4=Mohamed|last5=Naik|first5=Raj|date=2011-08-10|title=Optimal primary surgical treatment for advanced epithelial ovarian cancer|journal=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|issue=8|pages=CD007565|doi=10.1002/14651858.cd007565.pub2|issn=1465-1858|pmc=6457688|pmid=21833960}}</ref>\n\nIn advanced cancers, where complete removal is not an option, as much tumor as possible is removed in a procedure called [[debulking]] surgery. This surgery is not always successful, and is less likely to be successful in women with extensive metastases in the peritoneum, stage- IV disease, cancer in the [[porta hepatis|transverse fissure of the liver]], [[mesentery]], or diaphragm, and large areas of ascites.

This allows chemotherapy to better reach the remaining cancer cells, which are more likely to be fast-growing and therefore chemosensitive.<ref name=\"Hoffman35\" />\n\nInterval debulking surgery is another protocol used, where neoadjuvant chemotherapy is given, debulking surgery is performed, and chemotherapy is finished after debulking.<ref name=\":2\" /> Though no definitive studies have been completed, it is shown to be approximately equivalent to primary debulking surgery in terms of survival, and shows slightly lower morbidity.<ref name=\"Hoffman35\" />\n\nThere are several different surgical procedures that can be employed to treat ovarian cancer. For stage I and II cancer, laparascopic (keyhole) surgery can be used, but metastases may not be found. For advanced cancer, laparoscopy is not used, since debulking metastases requires access to the entire peritoneal cavity. Depending on the extent of the cancer, procedures may include a bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, biopsies throughout the peritoneum and abdominal lymphatic system, [[omentectomy]], [[splenectomy]], [[bowel resection]], [[Diaphragm resection|diaphragm stripping or resection]], [[appendectomy]], or even a posterior [[pelvic exenteration]].<ref name=\"Hoffman35\" />\n\nTo fully stage ovarian cancer, [[lymphadenectomy]] can be included in the surgery, but a significant survival benefit to this practice may not happen.<ref name=Jayson/> This is particularly important in germ cell tumors because they frequently metastasize to nearby lymph nodes.<ref name=Harrisons/>\n\nIf ovarian cancer recurs, secondary surgery is sometimes a treatment option.

Chemotherapy is used after surgery to treat any residual disease, if appropriate.  In some cases, there may be reason to perform chemotherapy first, followed by surgery. This is called \"neoadjuvant chemotherapy\", and is common when a tumor cannot be completely removed or optimally debulked via surgery.

Intestinal obstructions in multiple sites are the most common proximate cause of death.<ref name=Jayson/> Intestinal obstruction in ovarian cancer can either be a true obstruction, where tumor blocks the [[intestinal lumen]], or a pseudo-obstruction, when tumor prevents normal [[peristalsis]].<ref>{{cite book |last1 = Gucalp |first1 = Rasim |last2 = Dutcher |first2 = Janice | name-list-format = vanc |chapter = Oncologic Emergencies |veditors = Longo DL, Kasper DL, Jameson JL, Fauci AS, Hauser SL, Loscalzo J |title = Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine |publisher = McGraw-Hill |year = 2012 |edition = 18th |isbn = 978-0-07-174889-6|title-link = Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine }}</ref> Continuous accumulation of ascites can be treated by placing a drain that can be self-drained.<ref name=Jayson/>\n\n=== Prognostic factors ===\nThere are a number of [[prognostic factor]]s in ovarian cancer.

There is conflicting evidence for BRCA1 as a prognostic factor. Conversely, negative prognostic factors - those that indicate a worse chance of survival - include rupture of the ovarian capsule during surgery, older age (over 45 years), mucinous type, stage IV, high histologic grade, clear cell type, upper abdominal involvement, high CA-125 levels, the presence of tumor cells in the blood, and elevated [[Cyclooxygenase 2|cyclooxygenase-2]].<ref name=\":7\" />\n\nExpression of various mRNAs can also be prognostic for ovarian cancer.

Overall, in a 5-year period, 20% of stage I and II cancers recur. Most recurrences are in the abdomen.<ref name=\"Hoffman35\" /> If a recurrence occurs in advanced disease, it typically occurs within 18 months of initial treatment (18 months [[progression-free survival]]). Recurrences can be treated, but the disease-free interval tends to shorten and chemoresistance increases with each recurrence.<ref name=Jayson/> When a dysgerminoma recurs, it is most likely to recur within a year of diagnosis, and other malignant germ cell tumors recur within 2 years 90% of the time. Germ cell tumors other than dysgerminomas have a poor prognosis when they relapse, with a 10% long-term survival rate.<ref name=\":8\"/> Low malignant potential tumors rarely relapse, even when fertility-sparing surgery is the treatment of choice. 15% of LMP tumors relapse after unilateral surgery in the previously unaffected ovary, and they are typically easily treated with surgery. More advanced tumors may take up to 20 years to relapse, if they relapse at all, and are only treated with surgery unless the tumor has changed its histological characteristics or grown very quickly. In these cases, and when there is significant ascites, chemotherapy may also be used. Relapse is usually indicated by rising CA-125 levels and then progresses to symptomatic relapse within 2\u20136 months.<ref name=Hoffman35/> Recurrent sex cord-stromal tumors are typically unresponsive to treatment but not aggressive.<ref name=\":8\"/>\n\nIt is the most deadly gynecologic cancer.<ref name=\"Hoffman35\">{{cite book |chapter = Epithelial Ovarian Cancer |pages = 853\u2013878 |title = Williams Gynecology |edition = 2nd |publisher = McGraw Hill Medical |first1 = Barbara L. |last1 = Hoffman |first2 = John O. |last2 = Schorge |first3 = Joseph I. |last3 = Schaffer |first4 = Lisa M. |last4 = Halvorson |first5 = Karen D. |last5 = Bradshaw |first6 = F.

Angiogenesis inhibitors in the [[receptor tyrosine kinase]] inhibitor group, including [[pazopanib]], [[cediranib]], and [[nintedanib]], have also been shown to increase progression free survival (PFS), but their benefit for overall survival has not been investigated as of 2015.<ref name=\"Jayson\" /> Preliminary research showed that cediranib combined with platins in recurrent ovarian cancer increased the time to second recurrence by 3\u20134 months and increased survival by 3 months.<ref name=\":6\" /> [[MK-1775]] is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor that is being used in combination with paclitaxel and carboplatin in platinum-sensitive cancers with p53 mutations. [[Nintedanib]] is being researched as a potential therapy in combination with cyclophosphamide for people with recurrences.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\n[[Histone deacetylase inhibitor]]s (HDACi) are another area of research.\n\n===Hormones and radiation===\nHormone therapies are a topic of current research in ovarian cancer, particularly, the value of certain medications used to treat breast cancer. These include [[tamoxifen]], [[letrozole]], and [[anastrozole]]. Preliminary studies have showed a benefit for tamoxifen in a small number of people with advanced ovarian cancer. Letrozole may help to slow or stop growth of [[estrogen receptor]] positive ovarian cancer. Anastrozole is being investigated in postmenopausal people with estrogen receptor-positive cancer.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\nResearch into mitigating side effects of ovarian cancer treatment is also ongoing. [[Radiation fibrosis]], the formation of scar tissue in an area treated with radiation, may be relieved with [[Hyperbaric medicine|hyperbaric oxygen therapy]], but research has not been completed in this area.

During the visit, they drive Pebbles and Bamm-Bamm crazy by telling them what to do now that Pebbles is going to have a baby.\n\nMeanwhile, Fred and Barney try to help Bamm-Bamm sell his script, but end up in a mess with a robbery of a giant pearl when it is mistaken for a [[bowling ball]]. Big Rock sends his henchmen Rocky and Slick to recover the giant pearl. Fred and Barney manage to get the tickets to a taping of a show at ABC studios in hopes to sell Bamm-Bamm's script. Fred and Barney encounter Shelley Millstone in hopes to have her for Bamm-Bamm's film. It doesn't go well and the security guard is called in to eject them. A chase begins throughout the ABC studios and they eventually get thrown out.\n\nMeanwhile, Wilma and Betty are designing a nursery when Pebbles reveals that she is attending the premiere of \"It Came From the Tar Pits\" starring Craig Craigmore. Fred and Barney decide to take the advantage by finding someone to buy the screenplay. Rocky and Slick also slip in to get to Shelley Millstone in an attempt to get the giant pearl. Bamm-Bamm mistakes Slick and Rocky for movie producers. When they find Fred's car, they are attacked by Dino. Back at the party, Fred tries to get to Shelly Millstone, which ends up with Craig Craigmore being injured. The next day, Pebbles has Fred attend a baby training seminar while she does paperwork for her boss, Mr. Pyrite.\n\nWith Bamm-Bamm exhausted, Barney attends in Bamm-Bamm's place. Slick and Rocky follow Fred to the baby training seminar where Slick and Rocky infiltrate the class. It soon breaks up into a fight which ends up with Fred, Barney, Slick, and Rocky being thrown out. After a call from Rocky, Big Rock gets impatient and decides to take over the operation. Pebbles and Bamm-Bamm declare themselves unready for the baby after they were busy. Fred and Wilma try to get Pebbles to calm down until she breaks down. The next day while Fred apologises to Pebbles about being too helpful, Pebbles attends a baby shower which Wilma's mother Pearl also attends. Pearl sends Fred and Barney to get the baby supplies. At the grocery store, they end up gaining a lot of \"Maps to the Stars' Homes\" and decide to take another shot at Shelly Millstone.\n\nLater that night, Fred and Barney sneak into Shelly's property and distract the guard dogs. Rocky and Slick show Big Rock the house where Fred and Barney are staying and mistake Pearl for Fred when they abduct her. The next morning, Fred confesses to Bamm-Bamm that he lost the script in Shelley Millstone's yard. They soon return a call from Big Rock who demands the giant pearl in exchange for Pearl's freedom.

Pebbles gives birth to twins, Roxy (who has muscular strength like her father) and Chip (who has his Grandpa Flintstone's mouth because he's another chip off the old Flintstone). As for Bamm-Bamm's script, Shelly Millstone got Bamm Bamm's script when Fred and Barney left it to her house.  She loves the script and wants to star in it and Bamm Bamm sold his screenplay.
