They are the biggest of the British native breeds, and are believed to have descended from the large red cattle of [[Normandy]] which were imported during the [[Norman conquest of England|Norman invasion]] of [[England]]. The breed is a rich, medium red with copper tints, though it varies in shade and can even appear slightly mottled.

The South Devon of today originated in [[South West England]], in an area of [[Devon]] known as the [[South Hams]] from where they spread right across the counties of Devon and [[Cornwall]].  Historical evidence indicates that isolation caused the divergence of the [[North Devon cattle|North]] and South Devon into physically distinct types, thoug'''\u010dh occasional crossing between the two breeds occurred until the mid-nineteenth century.\n# \n# ===The breed in the nineteenth century===\n# The South Devon had been established as a breed by the year 1800.  With a light red coat, they were powerfully built and supplied rich milk and good beef, finely grained and marbled, and were relied upon to pull ploughshares until well into the nineteenth century.  Careful selection of breeding stock improved the breed considerably.  The [[South Devon Herd Book Society]] was founded in 1891 when it was recognised by the government as an official body, and the South Devons become one of the fourteen breeds of cattle whose [[herd book]]s date back to the second half of the nineteenth century.\n# \n# ===The breed in the twentieth century===\n# During the early years of the twentieth century the breed was considered as dual purpose, for the production of milk and beef.  Although most herds were milked during and soon after the [[Second World War]] the trend has been increasingly towards beefier sires since the 1960s. Although it is now a purely beef breed, the dual-purpose heritage has significance for the suckling of calves.\n# \n# ===The breed in the twenty-first century===\n# Recently, there have been attempts to re-introduce the breed into dairy farming.  Taverner's Farm in Devon has a small herd which they use to produce their own brand of ice cream (Orange Elephant ice cream).  They have attempted to produce a bull for this herd by artificial insemination of their aged prize heifer with 45-year-old semen from the [[Rare Breeds Survival Trust]]'s national genetic archive.

Peary, a professor. <ref name=\"e.com\"/> At some point in his childhood, he moved to [[South Carolina]] and then [[New Jersey]]. In 1971, he earned a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] in History from the [[University of Wisconsin in Madison]]. While attending UW, he along with Karyn Kay ran the Pinocchio Film Society. In 1975, he earned an [[Master of Arts|M.A.]] with honors<ref name=\"e.com\"/> in Cinema at the [[University of Southern California]]. While attending USC, he worked as the [[fine arts]] and [[sports]] editor for ''L.A. Panorama''. Since 1977, he has lived in [[New York City]].\n\n==Career==\n===Film criticism===\nOver the years, his film criticism writing has been published in the [[TV Guide (Canada)|Canadian ''TV Guide'']], ''Focus on Film'', ''Bijou'' magazine, ''[[The Velvet Light Trap]]'', ''[[Newsday]]'', ''Film and Filming'', ''[[The Philadelphia Bulletin]]'', ''[[Movieline]]'', ''[[Cineaste (magazine)|Cineaste]]'', ''Video Times/Video Movies'', ''[[The New York Daily News]]'', ''[[The Boston Globe]]'', ''[[SoHo Weekly News|SoHo News]]'', and ''TimesSquare.com''. For several years, he was a contributing editor to the now defunct [http://brinkzine.com/blogs/popculture-by-danny-peary/ ''Brinkzine.com'']{{dead link|date=January 2018|bot=InternetArchiveBot|fix-attempted=yes}}. He formally had a blog, \"Danny Peary on Film\", for ''Sag Harbor Express'', was the [[New York City|New York]] [[correspondent]] for the [[Australian]] magazine ''[[Filmink|FilmInk]]'', and now conducts celebrity interviews to [[Dan's Papers]] called, \"Danny Peary Talks To...\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.danspapers.com/tag/danny-peary/|title=danny-peary Archives|publisher=[[Dan's Papers]]|access-date=August 21, 2019}}</ref>\n\n===''Cult Movies'' books===\nIn 1981, Peary released his book, ''[[Cult Movies (book)|Cult Movies]]''. He followed it up with ''[[Cult Movies 2]]'' in 1983, and ''[[Cult Movies 3]]'' in 1989. As the titles suggest, these books covered critically ignored (at the time) [[cult film|cult films]]. Each book contained essays and reviews by Peary for each film, including production details, including information gleaned from interviews Peary had with various producers, directors and actors. These helped foster a growing interest in the [[Cult following|cult movie phenomenon]] among the more general film fan audience{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}. Peary's response to the films under discussion was not always positive, and his writing often shows bemusement regarding the appeal of some titles, as well as occasional disgust. In some ways the ''Cult Movies'' books can be seen as one of the first critical \u201cSeal of Approval\u201d acknowledgements of many of these film titles.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}} In 2014, Workman Publishing released three genre ebooks, with 100 revised chapters culled from Peary's trilogy, under the titles, ''Cult Horror Movies'', ''Cult Midnight Movies'' and ''Cult Crime Movies''.<ref name=\"RE.com\"/>\n\n===Sports writing===\nIn 2004, he worked with [[Ralph Kiner]] on his autobiography, ''Baseball Forever: Reflections on 60 Years in the Game''. In 2010, Peary and Tom Clavin published a biography about [[Roger Maris]] titled, ''Roger Maris: Baseball's Reluctant Hero''. In 2012, they published another biography about [[Gil Hodges]] titled, ''Gil Hodges: The Brooklyn Bums, The Miracle Mets and the Extraordinary Life of a Baseball Legend''. In 2015, he collaborated with Olympic gold medalist and cancer survivor [[Shannon Miller]] on her memoir, ''It's Not about Perfect: Competing for My Country and Fighting for My Life''. Also in 2015, he published ''Baseball Immortal: Derek Jeter: A Career in Quotes''. In 2016, he published ''Jackie Robinson in Quotes: The Remarkable Life of Baseball's Most Significant Player''. In 2018, he collaborated with Hana Ali on a book about the origins of her father's greatest quotes, ''Ali on Ali: Why He Said What He Said When He Said It''.\n\n===Television career===\n====''ThunderCats'' and ''SilverHawks''====\nIn 1985, he wrote an episode of the animated show, ''[[ThunderCats (1985 TV series)|ThunderCats]]'', titled \"The Mountain.\" In 1986, he wrote an episode for ''[[SilverHawks]]'' titled \"Undercover.\"\n====Sports-related television====\nIn 1986, he was the writer-researcher on the national sports interview TV show, ''[[The Tim McCarver Show]]'' and has done 3 books with McCarver, a close friend. Since 2017, he has been the writer-researcher for ''The James Brown Show''.\n\n===Various careers===\nHe began writing in 1971, a script reader for the short-lived production company [[Brut Productions]] in 1975, a photo researcher for [[Workman Publishing]] in 1977.\n\n==Media appearances==\nHe was interviewed for ''[[True Hollywood Story]]'' documentaries on the [[E!|E!

He has written and edited many books on [[Film|cinema]] and sports-related topics. Peary is most famous for his book ''[[Cult Movies (book)|Cult Movies]]'' (1980), which spawned two sequels, ''[[Cult Movies 2]]'' (1983) and ''[[Cult Movies 3]]'' (1988) and are all credited for providing more public interest to the [[cult movie]] phenomenon.<ref name=\"RE.com\">{{cite web|last=Wloszczyna|first=Susan|url=https://www.rogerebert.com/interviews/share-your-love-author-danny-peary-on-cult-movies|title=SHARE YOUR LOVE: AUTHOR DANNY PEARY ON \"CULT MOVIES\"|publisher=[[RogerEbert.com]]|date=April 21, 2016|access-date=August 21, 2019}}</ref>\n\nHe is the brother of film critic, columnist, actor, and documentary filmmaker [[Gerald Peary]].\n\n==Early life and education==\nDannis Peary was born in [[Philippi, West Virginia]] to Laura and Joseph Y. Peary, a professor. <ref name=\"e.com\"/> At some point in his childhood, he moved to [[South Carolina]] and then [[New Jersey]]. In 1971, he earned a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] in History from the [[University of Wisconsin in Madison]]. While attending UW, he along with Karyn Kay ran the Pinocchio Film Society. In 1975, he earned an [[Master of Arts|M.A.]] with honors<ref name=\"e.com\"/> in Cinema at the [[University of Southern California]]. While attending USC, he worked as the [[fine arts]] and [[sports]] editor for ''L.A. Panorama''. Since 1977, he has lived in [[New York City]].\n\n==Career==\n===Film criticism===\nOver the years, his film criticism writing has been published in the [[TV Guide (Canada)|Canadian ''TV Guide'']], ''Focus on Film'', ''Bijou'' magazine, ''[[The Velvet Light Trap]]'', ''[[Newsday]]'', ''Film and Filming'', ''[[The Philadelphia Bulletin]]'', ''[[Movieline]]'', ''[[Cineaste (magazine)|Cineaste]]'', Video Times/Video Movies, ''[[The New York Daily News]]'', ''[[The Boston Globe]]'', ''[[SoHo Weekly News|SoHo News]]'', ''TimesSquare.com''. For several years, he was a contributing editor to the now defunct [http://brinkzine.com/blogs/popculture-by-danny-peary/ ''Brinkzine.com'']{{dead link|date=January 2018|bot=InternetArchiveBot|fix-attempted=yes}}. He formally had a blog, \"Danny Peary on Film\", for ''Sag Harbor Express'', was the [[New York City|New York]] [[correspondent]] for the [[Australian]] magazine ''[[Filmink|FilmInk]]'', and now conducts celebrity interviews to [[Dan's Papers]] called, \"Danny Peary Talks To...\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.danspapers.com/tag/danny-peary/|title=danny-peary Archives|publisher=[[Dan's Papers]]|access-date=August 21, 2019}}</ref>\n\n===''Cult Movies'' books===\nIn 1981, Peary released his book, ''[[Cult Movies (book)|Cult Movies]]''. He followed it up with ''[[Cult Movies 2]]'' in 1983, and ''[[Cult Movies 3]]'' in 1989. As the titles suggest, these books covered critically ignored (at the time) [[cult film|cult films]]. Each book contained essays and reviews by Peary for each film, including production details, including information gleaned from interviews Peary had with various producers, directors and actors. These helped foster a growing interest in the [[Cult following|cult movie phenomenon]] among the more general film fan audience{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}. Peary's response to the films under discussion was not always positive, and his writing often shows bemusement regarding the appeal of some titles, as well as occasional disgust. In some ways the ''Cult Movies'' books can be seen as one of the first critical \u201cSeal of Approval\u201d acknowledgements of many of these film titles.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}} In 2014, Workman Publishing released three genre ebooks, with 100 revised chapters culled from Peary's trilogy, under the titles, ''Cult Horror Movies'', ''Cult Midnight Movies'' and ''Cult Crime Movies''.<ref name=\"RE.com\"/>\n\n===Sports writing===\nIn 2004, he worked with [[Ralph Kiner]] on his autobiography, ''Baseball Forever: Reflections on 60 Years in the Game''. In 2010, Peary and Tom Clavin published a biography about [[Roger Maris]] titled, ''Roger Maris: Baseball's Reluctant Hero''. In 2012, they published another biography about [[Gil Hodges]] titled, ''Gil Hodges: The Brooklyn Bums, The Miracle Mets and the Extraordinary Life of a Baseball Legend''. In 2015, he collaborated with Olympic gold medalist and cancer survivor [[Shannon Miller]] on her memoir, ''It's Not about Perfect: Competing for My Country and Fighting for My Life''. Also in 2015, he published ''Baseball Immortal: Derek Jeter: A Career in Quotes''. In 2016, he published ''Jackie Robinson in Quotes: The Remarkable Life of Baseball's Most Significant Player''. In 2018, he collaborated with Hana Ali on a book about the origins of her father's greatest quotes, ''Ali on Ali: Why He Said What He Said When He Said It''.\n\n===Television career===\n====''ThunderCats'' and ''SilverHawks''====\nIn 1985, he wrote an episode of the animated show, ''[[ThunderCats (1985 TV series)|ThunderCats]]'', titled \"The Mountain.\" In 1986, he wrote an episode for ''[[SilverHawks]]'' titled \"Undercover.\"\n====Sports-related television====\nIn 1986, he was the writer-researcher on the national sports interview TV show, ''[[The Tim McCarver Show]]'' and has done 3 books with McCarver, a close friend. Since 2017, he has been the writer-researcher for ''The James Brown Show''.\n\n===Various careers===\nHe began writing in 1971, a script reader for the short-lived production company [[Brut Productions]] in 1975, a photo researcher for [[Workman Publishing]] in 1977.\n\n==Media appearances==\nHe was interviewed for ''[[True Hollywood Story]]'' documentaries on the [[E!|E! Network]], the 2010 documentary ''[[Machete Maidens Unleashed!]]''.

Along with [[Walter Lini]] he founded the [[Vanua'aku Pati]], a political party which supported political independence for Vanuatu, [[socialism|socialist]] policies, and drew most of its support from Vanuatu's [[English language|English]]-speaking population. Vanuatu did gain independence in 1980, with Lini as the country's first prime minister. Kalpokas became [[foreign minister]] of Vanuatu in 1983, but gave up this position after a few months. He again became foreign minister in 1987, this time remaining in that post for four years.\n\nOn 6 September 1991, Kalpokas and some other members of the Vanua'aku Pati defected from Lini's government and supported a no-confidence vote against him. Kalpokas then became the prime minister, to remain in office until after parliamentary elections. The elections resulted in the opposition [[Union of Moderate Parties]] taking control of the government, and Kalpokas left office on 16 December 1991. The split in the Vanua'aku Party would remain permanent, as Lini left to start another political party.\n\nIn March 1998, following parliamentary elections which resulted in gains for the Vanua'aku Pati and Lini's National United Party, Kalpokas and Lini formed a coalition government. Kalpokas took office as [[prime minister]] again on 30 March 1998. He also became foreign minister for a third time but soon gave up this post. Lini died in February 1999, but the government continued.

Along with [[Walter Lini]] he founded the [[Vanua'aku Pati]] a political party which supported political independence for Vanuatu, [[socialism|socialist]] policies, and drew most of its support from Vanuatu's [[English language|English]]-speaking population. Vanuatu did gain independence in 1980, with Lini as the country's first prime minister. Kalpokas became [[foreign minister]] of Vanuatu in 1983 but gave up this position after a few months. He again became foreign minister in 1987, this time remaining in that post for four years.\n\nOn 6 September 1991, Kalpokas and some other members of the Vanua'aku Pati defected from Lini's government and supported a no-confidence vote against him. Kalpokas then became the prime minister, to remain in office until after parliamentary elections. The elections resulted in the opposition [[Union of Moderate Parties]] taking control of the government, and Kalpokas left office on 16 December 1991. The split in the Vanua'aku Party would remain permanent, as Lini left to start another political party.\n\nIn March 1998, following parliamentary elections which resulted in gains for the Vanua'aku Pati and Lini's National United Party, Kalpokas and Lini formed a coalition government. Kalpokas took office as [[prime minister]] again on 30 March 1998. He also became foreign minister for a third time but soon gave up this post. Lini died in February 1999, but the government continued. It collapsed in November 1999 when Kalpokas resigned as prime minister to prevent a no-confidence vote.\n\nIn 2001, after nearly a decade as leader of the Vanua'aku Pati, Kalpokas gave up the party leadership. He served as [[List of Speakers of the Parliament of Vanuatu|Speaker of the Parliament]] from May 2001 to May 2002. In August 2004, he was a candidate to become [[President (government title)|President]] of Vanuatu, and received 26 votes in the first round but then withdrew as it became clear that he would not be able to gain enough support.\n\nIn November 2007, he was appointed as Vanuatu's [[List of Permanent Representatives to the United Nations|Permanent Representative to the United Nations]].<ref>[http://missions.un.int/protocol/documents/HeadsofMissions.pdf United Nations website] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080624200947/http://missions.un.int/protocol/documents/HeadsofMissions.pdf |date=24 June 2008 }}</ref>\n\nKalpokas died following several days with a bout of ill health on 20 March 2019, at the age of 75.<ref name=RNZ>{{Cite web|url=https://www.radionz.co.nz/international/pacific-news/385197/a-founding-father-of-vanuatu-dies|title=A founding father of Vanuatu dies|publisher=[[Radio New Zealand]]|date=20 March 2019|accessdate=20 March 2019}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n* [http://www.worldwhoswho.com/views/entry.html?id=kal-0061 KALPOKAS, Donald] International Who's Who. accessed 4 September 2006.\n* [http://rulers.org/indexk1.html Index Ka] Rulers.org. accessed 4 September 2006.\n\n{{VanuatuPMs}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Kalpokas, Donald}}\n[[Category:1943 births]]\n[[Category:2019 deaths]]\n[[Category:Prime Ministers of Vanuatu]]\n[[Category:Speakers of the Parliament of Vanuatu]]\n[[Category:Foreign Ministers of Vanuatu]]\n[[Category:Members of the Parliament of Vanuatu]]\n[[Category:People from Shefa Province]]\n[[Category:Vanuatuan socialists]]\n[[Category:Permanent Representatives of Vanuatu to the United Nations]]\n[[Category:Vanua'aku Pati politicians]]\n", "name_user": "O-dog222", "label": "safe", "comment": "Copyediting for commas", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Kalpokas"}
