The medals hanging from the lion's rampant (which represented Cheshire and [[Lancashire]], owing to Stockport's location astride the Mersey which forms the historic border between the two counties) were removed. It also saw the return of a football on the shield. This change was made in part because as of the 2010\u201311 season, Stockport County was sponsored by the Metropolitan Borough Council.<ref name=\"Npower League Two 2010 - 2011 Kits\">{{cite web | url=http://www.historicalkits.co.uk/English_Football_League/season/2010-2011/league-two.html| title=Npower League Two 2010 \u2013 2011| work=Historical Kits | accessdate=9 September 2013|last=Moor|first=Dave|date=9 September 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe crest was altered in 2011 to re-include the town motto.

In addition, the football was again removed from the shield. The [[Stockport County Supporters' Co - Operative]] used the blue on white cross symbol from the 1978 badge as the main identifier in their company logo.

During the mid-1960s, the Football League introduced a minimum admission price for all clubs in all four divisions, attempting to help boost revenue for lower clubs. It had the desired effect only in small towns miles from big city teams. It had the opposite effect in larger places like Stockport, where lower-league clubs were in relatively close proximity to clubs in higher divisions. Stockport devised a solution, moving all their home games to Friday evening kick-offs, which generated larger crowds and extra business in surrounding pubs and restaurants. Still, during the [[1998\u201399 in English football|1998\u201399]] season, crowds averaged around 20,000 less than local rivals Manchester City, who were a division below Stockport at the time.<ref name=\"Archive : England 1998-1999\">{{cite web | url=http://www.european-football-statistics.co.uk/attn/archive/aveeng99.htm| title=Attendances \u2013 Archive : England 1998\u20131999| publisher=European Football Statistics | accessdate=15 April 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120206133246/http://www.european-football-statistics.co.uk/attn/archive/aveeng99.htm |archivedate=6 February 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn 2004, the club notably attracted a crowd of more than 20,000 for one of its tour matches in China.

That game in particular attracted a large crowd as the town of Stockport supported its team at [[Edgeley Park]]. If Stockport had lost that particular game, they would have been relegated for the second successive season, and more significantly, would have been relegated from [[the Football League]] for the first time, an embarrassment as the team had competed continuously in [[the Football League]] since 1900.

The medals hanging from the lion's rampant (which represented Cheshire and [[Lancashire]], owing to Stockport's location astride the Mersey which forms the historic border between the two counties) were removed. It also saw the return of a football on the shield. This change was made in part because as of the 2010\u201311 season, Stockport County was sponsored by the Metropolitan Borough Council.<ref name=\"Npower League Two 2010 - 2011 Kits\">{{cite web | url=http://www.historicalkits.co.uk/English_Football_League/season/2010-2011/league-two.html| title=Npower League Two 2010 \u2013 2011| work=Historical Kits | accessdate=9 September 2013|last=Moor|first=Dave|date=9 September 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe crest was altered in 2011 to re-include the town motto. The new version added two white ribbons \u2013 one at the top, with ''Animo et Fide'', and one at the bottom with ''Stockport County F.C.''. In addition, the football was again removed from the shield. The [[Stockport County Supporters' Co - Operative]] used the blue on white cross symbol from the 1978 badge as the main identifier in their company logo. County's kit was supplied by local manufacturer [[Umbro]] who supplied all three of County's kit for the 2013\u201314 season, replacing [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]], thus making County the only senior club in

During the mid-1960s, the Football League introduced a minimum admission price for all clubs in all four divisions, attempting to help boost revenue for lower clubs. It had the desired effect only in small towns miles from big city teams. It had the opposite effect in larger places like Stockport, where lower-league clubs were in relatively close proximity to clubs in higher divisions. Stockport devised a solution, moving all their home games to Friday evening kick-offs, which generated larger crowds and extra business in surrounding pubs and restaurants. Still, during the [[1998\u201399 in English football|1998\u201399]] season, crowds averaged around 20,000 less than local rivals Manchester City, who were a division below Stockport at the time.<ref name=\"Archive : England 1998-1999\">{{cite web | url=http://www.european-football-statistics.co.uk/attn/archive/aveeng99.htm| title=Attendances \u2013 Archive : England 1998\u20131999| publisher=European Football Statistics | accessdate=15 April 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120206133246/http://www.european-football-statistics.co.uk/attn/archive/aveeng99.htm |archivedate=6 February 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn 2004, the club notably attracted a crowd of more than 20,000 for one of its tour matches in China.

That game in particular attracted a large crowd as the town of Stockport supported its team at [[Edgeley Park]]. If Stockport had lost that particular game, they would have been relegated for the second successive season, and more significantly, would have been relegated from [[the Football League]] for the first time, an embarrassment as the team had competed continuously in [[the Football League]] since 1900.

The Apocrita have a common evolutionary ancestor and form a [[clade]]; wasps as a group do not form a clade, but are [[Paraphyly|paraphyletic]] with respect to bees and ants.\n\nThe most commonly known wasps, such as [[yellowjacket]]s and [[hornet]]s, are in the family [[Vespidae]] and are [[Eusociality|eusocial]], living together in a nest with an egg-laying queen and non-reproducing workers. Eusociality is favoured by the unusual [[haplodiploid]] system of [[sex-determination system|sex determination]] in Hymenoptera, as it makes sisters exceptionally closely related to each other. However, the majority of wasp species are solitary, with each adult female living and breeding independently. Females typically have an [[ovipositor]] for laying eggs in or near a food source for the larvae, though in the [[Aculeata]] the ovipositor is often modified instead into a [[Sting (biology)|sting]] used for defense or prey capture. Wasps play many [[ecology|ecological roles]]. Some are [[predator]]s or pollinators, whether to feed themselves or to provision their nests. Many, notably the [[cuckoo wasp]]s, are [[kleptoparasite]]s, laying eggs in the nests of other wasps. Many of the solitary wasps are [[parasitoid wasp|parasitoidal]], meaning they lay eggs on or in other insects (any life stage from egg to adult) and often [[mass provisioning|provision their own nests]] with such [[host (biology)|hosts]]. Unlike true parasites, the wasp larvae eventually kill their hosts. Solitary wasps parasitize almost every [[pest insect]], making wasps valuable in [[horticulture]] for [[biological pest control]] of species such as [[whitefly]] in [[tomato]]es and other crops.\n\nWasps first appeared in the fossil record in the [[Jurassic]], and diversified into many surviving superfamilies by the [[Cretaceous]]. They are a successful and diverse group of insects with tens of thousands of described species; wasps have spread to all parts of the world except for the polar regions. The largest social wasp is the [[Asian giant hornet]], at up to {{convert|5|cm}} in length; among the largest solitary wasps is a group of species known as [[tarantula hawk]]s, along with the giant scoliid of Indonesia (''[[Megascolia procer]]''). The smallest wasps are solitary [[chalcid wasp]]s in the family [[Mymaridae]], including the world's smallest known insect, with a body length of only {{convert|0.139|mm|in|abbr=on}}, and the smallest known flying insect, only {{convert|0.15|mm|in|abbr=on}} long.\n\nWasps have appeared in literature from [[Classical era|Classical times]], as the eponymous chorus of old men in [[Aristophanes]]' 422 BC comedy {{lang|grc|\u03a3\u03c6\u1fc6\u03ba\u03b5\u03c2}} ({{transl|grc|Sph\u0113kes}}), ''[[The Wasps]]'', and in [[science fiction]] from [[H. G. Wells]]'s 1904 novel ''[[The Food of the Gods and How It Came to Earth]]'', featuring giant wasps with three-inch-long stings. The name \"Wasp\"<!--intentionally Upper Case--> has been used for many warships and other military equipment.\n\n==Taxonomy and phylogeny==\n[[File:Wasps are Paraphyletic.svg|thumb|upright=1.6|Wasps are [[paraphyletic]], consisting of the [[clade]] [[Apocrita]] without [[ant]]s and [[bee]]s, which are not usually considered to be wasps.

With their powerful stings and conspicuous [[warning coloration]], often in black and yellow, social wasps are frequent models for [[Batesian mimicry]] by non-stinging insects, and are themselves involved in mutually beneficial [[M\u00fcllerian mimicry]] of other distasteful insects including bees and other wasps. All species of social wasps construct their nests using some form of plant fiber (mostly wood pulp) as the primary material, though this can be supplemented with mud, plant secretions (e.g., [[resin]]), and secretions from the wasps themselves; multiple fibrous brood cells are constructed, arranged in a honeycombed pattern, and often surrounded by a larger protective envelope. Wood fibers are gathered from weathered wood, softened by chewing and mixing with [[saliva]]. The placement of nests varies from group to group; yellow jackets such as ''[[Median wasp|Dolichovespula media]]'' and ''[[Dolichovespula sylvestris|D. sylvestris]]'' prefer to nest in trees and shrubs; ''[[Protopolybia exigua]] ''attaches its nests on the underside of leaves and branches; ''[[Polistes erythrocephalus]]'' chooses sites close to a water source.<ref name= bdigital>{{cite journal | author=Carlos A.

Although vespid mandibles are adapted for chewing and they appear to be feeding on the organism, they are often merely macerating it into submission.

The Apocrita have a common evolutionary ancestor and form a [[clade]]; wasps as a group do not form a clade, but are [[Paraphyly|paraphyletic]] with respect to bees and ants.\n\nThe most commonly known wasps, such as [[yellowjacket]]s and [[hornet]]s, are in the family [[Vespidae]] and are [[Eusociality|eusocial]], living together in a nest with an egg-laying queen and non-reproducing workers. Eusociality is favoured by the unusual [[haplodiploid]] system of [[sex-determination system|sex determination]] in Hymenoptera, as it makes sisters exceptionally closely related to each other. However, the majority of wasp species are solitary, with each adult female living and breeding independently. Females typically have an [[ovipositor]] for laying eggs in or near a food source for the larvae, though in the [[Aculeata]] the ovipositor is often modified instead into a [[Sting (biology)|sting]] used for defense or prey capture. Wasps play many [[ecology|ecological roles]]. Some are [[predator]]s or pollinators, whether to feed themselves or to provision their nests. Many, notably the [[cuckoo wasp]]s, are [[kleptoparasite]]s, laying eggs in the nests of other wasps. Many of the solitary wasps are [[parasitoid wasp|parasitoidal]], meaning they lay eggs on or in other insects (any life stage from egg to adult) and often [[mass provisioning|provision their own nests]] with such [[host (biology)|hosts]]. Unlike true parasites, the wasp larvae eventually kill their hosts. Solitary wasps parasitize almost every [[pest insect]], making wasps valuable in [[horticulture]] for [[biological pest control]] of species such as [[whitefly]] in [[tomato]]es and other crops.\n\nWasps first appeared in the fossil record in the [[Jurassic]], and diversified into many surviving superfamilies by the [[Cretaceous]]. They are a successful and diverse group of insects with tens of thousands of described species; wasps have spread to all parts of the world except for the polar regions. The largest social wasp is the [[Asian giant hornet]], at up to {{convert|5|cm}} in length; among the largest solitary wasps is a group of species known as [[tarantula hawk]]s, along with the giant scoliid of Indonesia (''[[Megascolia procer]]''). The smallest wasps are solitary [[chalcid wasp]]s in the family [[Mymaridae]], including the world's smallest known insect, with a body length of only {{convert|0.139|mm|in|abbr=on}}, and the smallest known flying insect, only {{convert|0.15|mm|in|abbr=on}} long.\n\nWasps have appeared in literature from [[Classical era|Classical times]], as the eponymous chorus of old men in [[Aristophanes]]' 422 BC comedy {{lang|grc|\u03a3\u03c6\u1fc6\u03ba\u03b5\u03c2}} ({{transl|grc|Sph\u0113kes}}), ''[[The Wasps]]'', and in [[science fiction]] from [[H. G. Wells]]'s 1904 novel ''[[The Food of the Gods and How It Came to Earth]]'', featuring giant wasps with three-inch-long stings.

With their powerful stings and conspicuous [[warning coloration]], often in black and yellow, social wasps are frequent models for [[Batesian mimicry]] by non-stinging insects, and are themselves involved in mutually beneficial [[M\u00fcllerian mimicry]] of other distasteful insects including bees and other wasps. All species of social wasps construct their nests using some form of plant fiber (mostly wood pulp) as the primary material, though this can be supplemented with mud, plant secretions (e.g., [[resin]]), and secretions from the wasps themselves; multiple fibrous brood cells are constructed, arranged in a honeycombed pattern, and often surrounded by a larger protective envelope. Wood fibers are gathered from weathered wood, softened by chewing and mixing with [[saliva]]. The placement of nests varies from group to group; yellow jackets such as ''[[Median wasp|Dolichovespula media]]'' and ''[[Dolichovespula sylvestris|D. sylvestris]]'' prefer to nest in trees and shrubs; ''[[Protopolybia exigua]] ''attaches its nests on the underside of leaves and branches; ''[[Polistes erythrocephalus]]'' chooses sites close to a water source.<ref name= bdigital>{{cite journal | author=Carlos A.

It is populated mainly by native [[Dusun people|Dusun]]s, while a sizeable [[Malaysian Chinese|Chinese]] community (of whom most are [[Hakka people|Hakkas]]) runs most of the shops in the town proper. As with many other small towns in Sabah and indeed Malaysia as a whole, the town itself consists of both newer concrete shoplots as well as old wooden ones, which are particularly prone to destruction by fire as evidenced in the destruction of one of the wooden shoplots in recent years. Now, Tamparuli is said to have the potential to grow with the convenience of a new shop site called Tamparuli Point.\n\nThe most famous landmark in Tamparuli is a long hanging [[bridge]] which is immortalized in the song ''Jambatan Tamparuli'', a popular [[Kadazan-Dusun]] song. Another bridge, built for motor traffic, spans the river far below the hanging bridge and is frequently flooded during heavy rain. The beginning lyric below is a Tamparuli Bridge song.\n\n'''''Pak pak kang ku doh (Pak pak I stepped),''' \n\n'''''Sumunsui doh jambatan (following/crossing the bridge),''' \n\n'''''Jambatan doh Tamparuli (The Tamparuli Bridge),''' \n\n'''''Bakasut tinggi oku (I wear high heels),''' \n\n'''''*Pak pak called 'pok pok', refers to the sound of shoes/feet, and in this song is the sound of high heels'''''\n\nTamparuli is located just off the [[Kota Kinabalu]] - [[Sandakan]] road, making it a popular stop for a snack or meal for travelers taking this route from the direction of Kota Kinabalu. The town is also a convenient stop en route to the town of Kiulu, a popular whitewater [[rafting]] destination for domestic and foreign tourists alike.\n\n== Etymology ==\nTamparuli town known was as called \"Bontoi\" (actually referring to a small village in that area) and, \"Bontoi\" of village name means a bridge believed to have existed for over 200 years long before it was named Tamparuli. From a small village, Tamparuli later evolved into a town. The change came after several outside traders, especially among Chinese people from Tuaran, set up some lumber shops in the 1930s.\n\nFrom the year 1942 until the year 1944, the Tamparuli area was used by the Japanese military as a base for heavy vehicles such as trucks. Then, the local people called that area are known as 'Tempat Lori' means truck place and, eventually, it turned called Tamparuli.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.tamparulisabah.com/p/history-of-tamparuli.html|title=HISTORY OF TAMPARULI|date=2011-11-29|access-date=2019-12-15|website=www.tamparulisabah.com|last=George|first=Harry}}</ref> Next, according to another source, the Tamparuli town also derives a name from words know as slapped by water and, this name derives from Brunei's word, due Brunei traders who came to Tamparuli had trouble to get up to the upstream because of the high water flow.\n\n== History ==\n=== Memorial Monuments ===\n[[File:Tamparuli SAbah Memorial-tablet-for-two-drowned-British-Servicemen-04.jpg|Right|thumb|[[Plaque]] of Memorial Monuments]]\nThere is a monument believed to be over 60 years old built near the market in Tamparuli town. According to historical sources, the purpose of the monument was to commemorate two British soldiers who died in a nearby river during a Land Rover four-wheel drive that they crossed across the Tamparuli bridge on May 18, 1960. The dead British soldier named JWN Hall of the Royal Health Corps and a driver, DC Cooper of the Royal Service Corps based at Paradise Camp, Kota Belud. The unfortunate tragedy occurred when two soldiers were on their way to send a severely injured woman from Kampung Sayap, Kota Belud to a hospital in Jesselton. At that time, the vehicle was in the middle of a bridge and an unexpected stream of currents had occurred causing the vehicle to drift. The bodies of the three victims were found with two still in the four-wheel-drive Land Rover that was swept away by the current. Three days later, two British soldiers were buried in the army cemetery at Paradise Camp in Kota Belud. The monument is also one of the visitors' places of interest in the town of Tamparuli.\n\n== Disaster ==\n=== Flood ===\nThe floods have a historical record in the area town of Tamparuli that reminds people until today, the floods also have impacted other areas such as [[Tuaran]], [[Tenghilan]] and, other districts in Sabah. In the year 1999, the area Tamparuli town was hit by a massive flood at that time and bring destroyed convenience such as the Tamparuli old bridge.

It is populated mainly by native [[Dusun people|Dusun]]s, while a sizeable [[Malaysian Chinese|Chinese]] community (of whom most are [[Hakka people|Hakkas]]) runs most of the shops in the town proper. As with many other small towns in Sabah and indeed Malaysia as a whole, the town itself consists of both newer concrete shoplots as well as old wooden ones, which are particularly prone to destruction by fire as evidenced in the destruction of one of the wooden shoplots in recent years. Now, Tamparuli is said to have the potential to grow with the convenience of a new shop site called Tamparuli Point.\n\nThe most famous landmark in Tamparuli is a long hanging [[bridge]] which is immortalized in the song ''Jambatan Tamparuli'', a popular [[Kadazan-Dusun]] song. Another bridge, built for motor traffic, spans the river far below the hanging bridge and is frequently flooded during heavy rain. The beginning lyric below is a Tamparuli Bridge song.\n\n'''''Pak pak kang ku doh (Pak pak I stepped),''' \n\n'''''Sumunsui doh jambatan (following/crossing the bridge),''' \n\n'''''Jambatan doh Tamparuli (The Tamparuli Bridge),''' \n\n'''''Bakasut tinggi oku (I wear high heels),''' \n\n'''''*Pak pak called 'pok pok', refers to the sound of shoes/feet, and in this song is the sound of high heels'''''\n\nTamparuli is located just off the [[Kota Kinabalu]] - [[Sandakan]] road, making it a popular stop for a snack or meal for travelers taking this route from the direction of Kota Kinabalu. The town is also a convenient stop en route to the town of Kiulu, a popular whitewater [[rafting]] destination for domestic and foreign tourists alike.\n\n== Etymology ==\nTamparuli town known was as called \"Bontoi\" (actually referring to a small village in that area) and, \"Bontoi\" of village name means a bridge believed to have existed for over 200 years long before it was named Tamparuli. From a small village, Tamparuli later evolved into a town. The change came after several outside traders, especially among Chinese people from Tuaran, set up some lumber shops in the 1930s.\n\nFrom the year 1942 until the year 1944, the Tamparuli area was used by the Japanese military as a base for heavy vehicles such as trucks. Then, the local people called that area are known as 'Tempat Lori' means truck place and, eventually, it turned called Tamparuli.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.tamparulisabah.com/p/history-of-tamparuli.html|title=HISTORY OF TAMPARULI|date=2011-11-29|access-date=2019-12-15|website=www.tamparulisabah.com|last=George|first=Harry}}</ref> Next, according to another source, the Tamparuli town also derives a name from words know as slapped by water and, this name derives from Brunei's word, due Brunei traders who came to Tamparuli had trouble to get up to the upstream because of the high water flow.\n\n== History ==\n=== Memorial Monuments ===\n[[File:Tamparuli SAbah Memorial-tablet-for-two-drowned-British-Servicemen-04.jpg|Right|thumb|[[Plaque]] of Memorial Monuments]]\nThere is a monument believed to be over 60 years old built near the market in Tamparuli town. According to historical sources, the purpose of the monument was to commemorate two British soldiers who died in a nearby river during a Land Rover four-wheel drive that they crossed across the Tamparuli bridge on May 18, 1960. The dead British soldier named JWN Hall of the Royal Health Corps and a driver, DC Cooper of the Royal Service Corps based at Paradise Camp, Kota Belud. The unfortunate tragedy occurred when two soldiers were on their way to send a severely injured woman from Kampung Sayap, Kota Belud to a hospital in Jesselton. At that time, the vehicle was in the middle of a bridge and an unexpected stream of currents had occurred causing the vehicle to drift. The bodies of the three victims were found with two still in the four-wheel-drive Land Rover that was swept away by the current. Three days later, two British soldiers were buried in the army cemetery at Paradise Camp in Kota Belud. The monument is also one of the visitors' places of interest in the town of Tamparuli.\n\n== Disaster ==\n=== Flood ===\nThe floods have a historical record in the area town of Tamparuli that reminds people until today, the floods also have impacted other areas such as [[Tuaran]], [[Tenghilan]] and, other districts in Sabah.

In 1785, they secretly contracted a marriage that was invalid under English civil law because his father, [[King George III]], had not consented to it. She was a [[Roman Catholic]] so, had the marriage been approved and valid, George would have lost his place in the [[Succession to the British throne|line of succession]], because the law at the time forbade Catholics or spouses of Catholics from becoming monarch. Before marrying the prince, Fitzherbert had been twice widowed. Her nephew-in-law from her first marriage, [[Thomas Weld (cardinal)|Cardinal Weld]], persuaded [[Pope Pius VII]] to declare the marriage sacramentally valid.<ref>Richard Abbot, \"Brighton's unofficial queen,\" THE TABLET, 1 September 2007, 12.</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nFitzherbert was born at [[Tong Castle]] in [[Shropshire]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Carrol|first=Leslie|title=A problem like Maria|url=http://lesliecarroll.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/JARW_39_14-21-Maria-Fitzherbert-article-Carroll.pdf|location=p.14}}</ref> She was the eldest child of Walter Smythe of [[Brambridge]], Hampshire, younger son of Sir John [[Smythe Baronets|Smythe]], 3rd [[Baronet]], of [[Acton Burnell]], Shropshire.

In spring, 1784, she was introduced to a youthful admirer: [[George IV of the United Kingdom|George, Prince of Wales]], six years her junior. The prince became infatuated with her and pursued her endlessly until she agreed to marry him.<ref>{{cite book|last=Farquhar|first=Michael|title=Behind the Palace Doors: Five Centuries of Sex, Adventure, Vice, Treachery, and Folly from Royal Britain|year=2011|publisher=Random House|location=House of Hanover|isbn=978-0812979046|pages=[https://archive.org/details/behindpalacedoor00mich/page/223 223]\u2013226|url=https://archive.org/details/behindpalacedoor00mich |url-access=registration}}</ref> Secretly, and \u2013 as both parties were well aware  \u2013 against the law, they went through a form of marriage on 15 December 1785, in the drawing room of her house in Park Street, London. Her uncle, Henry Errington, and her brother, Jack Smythe, were the witnesses. This invalid marriage ceremony was performed by one of the prince's [[Ecclesiastical Household|Chaplains in Ordinary]], the Reverend Robert Burt, whose debts (of \u00a3500) were paid by the prince to release him from the [[Fleet Prison]].<ref>Martin J. Levy, \"Maria Fitzherbert,\" ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, 2004.</ref>\n\nThe marriage was not valid under English law because it had not received the prior approval of [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George III]] and the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Council]] as required by the [[Royal Marriages Act 1772]]. Had approval been sought, it might not have been granted for many reasons including, for example, Fitzherbert's [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] allegiance. Had consent been given and the marriage been legal, the Prince of Wales would have been automatically removed from the [[succession to the British throne]] under the provisions of the [[Bill of Rights 1689|Bill of Rights]] and the [[Act of Settlement 1701]] and replaced as heir-apparent by his brother, [[Frederick, Duke of York and Albany]].<ref name=\"Maria Fitzherbert\"/> His brother, [[Prince Augustus Frederick]], contracted an invalid marriage with [[Lady Augusta Murray]] in 1793 without the King's consent and had two children with her.<ref>{{cite DNB|wstitle=Augustus Frederick|volume=2}}</ref>\n\nOn 23 June 1794, Fitzherbert was informed by letter that her relationship with the Prince was over. George told his younger brother, [[Prince Frederick, Duke of York and Albany]], that he and Fitzherbert were \"parted, but parted amicably\", conveying his intention to marry their first cousin, Duchess [[Caroline of Brunswick]]. According to [[King George III]] it was the only way out of a hole: his heir apparent's enormous debts of \u00a3600,000 would be paid the day he wed. So the Prince married Caroline on 8 April 1795.  However, in 1796, three days after Caroline gave birth to their daughter, [[Princess Charlotte of Wales]], on 10 January, the Prince of Wales wrote his last will and testament, bequeathing all his \"worldly property . . . to my Maria Fitzherbert, my wife, the wife of my heart and soul\". Although by the laws of the country she \"could not avail herself publicly of that name, still such she is in the eyes of Heaven, was, is, and ever will be such in mine\u2026\". However, this did not lead to a reunion. The Prince finally sought a reconciliation with his \"second self\" during the summer of 1798. By then, he had separated from Caroline for good and was bored with his mistress, [[Frances Villiers, Countess of Jersey]].\n\nDuring the first few years of his reign as King George IV, he turned violently against Fitzherbert and several of his former associates. Whenever he mentioned her name it was \"with feelings of disgust and horror\", claiming that their union \"was an artificial marriage\u2026 just to satisfy her; that it was no marriage \u2013 for there could be none without a licence or some written document.\" Fitzherbert was in possession of documents and after their final break her demands for her [[Life annuity|annuity]] payments were often accompanied by veiled threats to go public with her papers if she did not receive the funds. In June 1830, when the King was dying, he eagerly seized her \"get well soon\" letter and, after reading it, placed it under his pillow. Fitzherbert \u2013 who had no idea just how ill he was \u2013 was deeply hurt that he had never replied to her final letter.<ref>{{cite web|last=Carroll|first=Leslie|title=A problem like Maria|page=20|url=http://lesliecarroll.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/JARW_39_14-21-Maria-Fitzherbert-article-Carroll.pdf}}</ref>  However, before dying, the King asked to be buried with Fitzherbert's [[eye miniature]] around his neck, which was done.<ref name=\"Maria Fitzherbert\"/><ref>{{cite book|last=Williamson|first=Hugh Ross|title=Who was the man in the iron mask?: and other historical mysteries|year=2002|publisher=Penguin Classics|isbn=0-14-139097-2|page=330|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gpQbqEDGt-QC&pg=PA330 }}</ref>\n\n==Death==\nFollowing the death of George IV on 26 June 1830, it was discovered that he had kept all of Fitzherbert's letters, and steps were taken to destroy them.

Wilkins to open her vault at Coutts Bank in 1906.  The release of Wilkins' book later that year prompted several would-be descendants of the Prince and Fitzherbert to claim the latter's substantial estate.  A Rebecca Fitzherbert Harris of Kenvil, New Jersey, maintained that through family lore she was the great-granddaughter of the couple via a supposed son named Thomas Edward, after Fitzherbert's first two husbands.  In a letter to Edward VII, Harris claimed that Thomas also had a brother and sister who lived for a time with their mother in Dublin.  Thomas was supposedly sent to the United States in 1833 by Fitzherbert who thought her children would be safer there following her death.  Harris further stated that her family had received an income from an unknown source in the United Kingdom for many years.  Harris requested access to Fitzherbert's papers to pursue her claim of the estate.  Edward VII was noted to have acknowledged Harris' letter but stated that he would not assist her further.<ref>{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |author= |coauthors= |title= New York Woman Traces Descent to English King |curly= |url=https://cdnc.ucr.edu/cgi-bin/cdnc?a=d&d=LAH19060926.2.155&e=-------en--20--1--txt-txIN--------1 |format= California Digital Newspaper Collection |agency=  |work= The Los Angeles Herald |publisher= Hearst Newspapers |location= Los Angeles, USA |id= |pages= |page= |date= 26 September 1906 |accessdate= 23 October 2019|language= |quote= }}</ref>\n\nThe second codicil to Maria Fitzherbert's will<ref>Will of Maria Fitzherbert, approved for probate 20 Apr 1837, The National Archives (UK), record PROB 1\u201386</ref> outlines her two principal beneficiaries, and includes a personal note, \"...this paper is addressed to my two dear children...

There is no evidence that either of these women were the natural children of Maria Fitzherbert \u2013 indeed the reference to 'the affection any mother could do' (with stress on mother) could indicate she only saw herself as a mother-figure to them, and no more.

In 1785, they secretly contracted a marriage that was invalid under English civil law because his father, [[King George III]], had not consented to it. She was a [[Roman Catholic]] and so had the marriage been approved and valid, George would have lost his place in the [[Succession to the British throne|line of succession]] since the law then forbade Catholics and spouses of Catholics from becoming monarch. Before marrying the prince, Fitzherbert had been twice widowed. Her nephew-in-law from her first marriage, [[Thomas Weld (cardinal)|Cardinal Weld]], persuaded [[Pope Pius VII]] to declare the marriage sacramentally valid.<ref>Richard Abbot, \"Brighton's unofficial queen,\" THE TABLET, 1 September 2007, 12.</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nFitzherbert was born at [[Tong Castle|Tong]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Carrol|first=Leslie|title=A problem like Maria|url=http://lesliecarroll.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/JARW_39_14-21-Maria-Fitzherbert-article-Carroll.pdf|location=p.14}}</ref> She was the eldest child of Walter Smythe of [[Brambridge]], Hampshire, younger son of Sir John [[Smythe Baronets|Smythe]], 3rd [[Baronet]], of [[Acton Burnell]], Shropshire.

She was ten years younger than he. They had a son who died young. She was widowed again on 7 May 1781.

In spring, 1784, she was introduced to a youthful admirer: [[George IV of the United Kingdom|George, Prince of Wales]], six years her junior. The prince became infatuated with her and pursued her endlessly until she agreed to marry him.<ref>{{cite book|last=Farquhar|first=Michael|title=Behind the Palace Doors: Five Centuries of Sex, Adventure, Vice, Treachery, and Folly from Royal Britain|year=2011|publisher=Random House|location=House of Hanover|isbn=978-0812979046|pages=[https://archive.org/details/behindpalacedoor00mich/page/223 223]\u2013226|url=https://archive.org/details/behindpalacedoor00mich |url-access=registration}}</ref> Secretly, and \u2013 as both parties were well aware  \u2013 against the law, they went through a form of marriage on 15 December 1785, in the drawing room of her house in Park Street, London. Her uncle, Henry Errington, and her brother, Jack Smythe, were the witnesses. This invalid marriage ceremony was performed by one of the prince's [[Ecclesiastical Household|Chaplains in Ordinary]], the Reverend Robert Burt, whose debts (of \u00a3500) were paid by the prince to release him from the [[Fleet Prison]].<ref>Martin J. Levy, \"Maria Fitzherbert,\" ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, 2004.</ref>\n\nThe marriage was not valid under English law because it had not received the prior approval of [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George III]] and the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Council]] as required by the [[Royal Marriages Act 1772]]. Had approval been sought, it might not have been granted for many reasons including, for example, Fitzherbert's [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] allegiance. Had consent been given and the marriage been legal, the Prince of Wales would have been automatically removed from the [[succession to the British throne]] under the provisions of the [[Bill of Rights 1689|Bill of Rights]] and the [[Act of Settlement 1701]] and replaced as heir-apparent by his brother, [[Frederick, Duke of York and Albany]].<ref name=\"Maria Fitzherbert\"/> His brother, [[Prince Augustus Frederick]], contracted an invalid marriage with [[Lady Augusta Murray]] in 1793 without the King's consent and had two children with her.<ref>{{cite DNB|wstitle=Augustus Frederick|volume=2}}</ref>\n\nOn 23 June 1794, Fitzherbert was informed by letter that her relationship with the Prince was over. George told his younger brother, [[Prince Frederick, Duke of York and Albany]], that he and Fitzherbert were \"parted, but parted amicably\", conveying his intention to marry their first cousin, Duchess [[Caroline of Brunswick]]. According to [[King George III]] it was the only way out of a hole: his heir apparent's enormous debts of \u00a3600,000 would be paid the day he wed. So the Prince married Caroline on 8 April 1795.  However, in 1796, three days after Caroline gave birth to their daughter, [[Princess Charlotte of Wales]], on 10 January, the Prince of Wales wrote his last will and testament, bequeathing all his \"worldly property . . . to my Maria Fitzherbert, my wife, the wife of my heart and soul\". Although by the laws of the country she \"could not avail herself publicly of that name, still such she is in the eyes of Heaven, was, is, and ever will be such in mine\u2026\". However, this did not lead to a reunion. The Prince finally sought a reconciliation with his \"second self\" during the summer of 1798. By then, he had separated from Caroline for good and was bored with his mistress, [[Frances Villiers, Countess of Jersey]].\n\nDuring the first few years of his reign as King George IV, he turned violently against Fitzherbert and several of his former associates. Whenever he mentioned her name it was \"with feelings of disgust and horror\", claiming that their union \"was an artificial marriage\u2026 just to satisfy her; that it was no marriage \u2013 for there could be none without a licence or some written document.\" Fitzherbert was in possession of documents and after their final break her demands for her [[Life annuity|annuity]] payments were often accompanied by veiled threats to go public with her papers if she did not receive the funds. In June 1830, when the King was dying, he eagerly seized her \"get well soon\" letter and, after reading it, placed it under his pillow. Fitzherbert \u2013 who had no idea just how ill he was \u2013 was deeply hurt that he had never replied to her final letter.<ref>{{cite web|last=Carroll|first=Leslie|title=A problem like Maria|page=20|url=http://lesliecarroll.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/JARW_39_14-21-Maria-Fitzherbert-article-Carroll.pdf}}</ref>  However, before dying, the King asked to be buried with Fitzherbert's [[eye miniature]] around his neck, which was done.<ref name=\"Maria Fitzherbert\"/><ref>{{cite book|last=Williamson|first=Hugh Ross|title=Who was the man in the iron mask?: and other historical mysteries|year=2002|publisher=Penguin Classics|isbn=0-14-139097-2|page=330|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gpQbqEDGt-QC&pg=PA330 }}</ref>\n\n==Death==\nFollowing the death of George IV on 26 June 1830, it was discovered that he had kept all of Fitzherbert's letters, and steps were taken to destroy them.

Wilkins to open her vault at Coutts Bank in 1906.  The release of Wilkins' book later that year prompted several would-be descendants of the Prince and Fitzherbert to claim the latter's substantial estate.  A Rebecca Fitzherbert Harris of Kenvil, New Jersey, maintained that through family lore she was the great-granddaughter of the couple via a supposed son named Thomas Edward, after Fitzherbert's first two husbands.  In a letter to Edward VII, Harris claimed that Thomas also had a brother and sister who lived for a time with their mother in Dublin.  Thomas was supposedly sent to the United States in 1833 by Fitzherbert who thought her children would be safer there following her death.  Harris further stated that her family had received an income from an unknown source in the United Kingdom for many years.  Harris requested access to Fitzherbert's papers to pursue her claim of the estate.  Edward VII was noted to have acknowledged Harris' letter but stated that he would not assist her further.<ref>{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |author= |coauthors= |title= New York Woman Traces Descent to English King |curly= |url=https://cdnc.ucr.edu/cgi-bin/cdnc?a=d&d=LAH19060926.2.155&e=-------en--20--1--txt-txIN--------1 |format= California Digital Newspaper Collection |agency=  |work= The Los Angeles Herald |publisher= Hearst Newspapers |location= Los Angeles, USA |id= |pages= |page= |date= 26 September 1906 |accessdate= 23 October 2019|language= |quote= }}</ref>\n\nThe second codicil to Maria Fitzherbert's will<ref>Will of Maria Fitzherbert, approved for probate 20 Apr 1837, The National Archives (UK), record PROB 1\u201386</ref> outlines her two principal beneficiaries, and includes a personal note, \"...this paper is addressed to my two dear children...

Seymour had been a close associate of George IV since their youth, and Seymour's son [[George Seymour (Royal Navy officer)|George]] was an executor and minor beneficiary of Fitzherbert's will. There is no evidence that either of these women were the natural children of Maria Fitzherbert \u2013 indeed the reference to 'the affection any mother could do' (with stress on mother) could indicate she only saw herself as a mother-figure to them, and no more. The will makes no reference to any sons, though this observation must be seen in its historic context; of the ten illegitimate children of [[Dorothea Jordan]], Irish actress and mistress of 20 years to the Duke of Clarence, care for the five boys was initially assumed by their father and his households, and custody and care for the girls given to Jordan.\n\nNotably, any such historical claim of descent is accompanied by controversy, and many of the preceding have been challenged.<ref name=\"A.J.
