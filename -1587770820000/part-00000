When it reached the area as planned, at 15:53 [[Eastern European Summer Time|local time]] (12:53&nbsp;UTC), [[Dnipropetrovsk]] Air Control (''Dnipro Control'') asked MH17 if they could climb to FL 350 as planned, and also to avoid a potential [[Conflict (air traffic control)|separation conflict]] with another flight, [[Singapore Airlines]] Flight 351 (SQ351), also at FL 330.

This request was also approved by ''Dnipro Control'' [[Air traffic control|ATC]].

At 16:19 local time (13:19 UTC), ''Dnipro Control'' noticed that the flight was {{convert|3.6|nmi|km}} north of the centreline of approved airway and instructed MH17 to return to the track. At 16:19 local time (13:19&nbsp;UTC), ''Dnipro Control'' contacted Russian ATC in [[Rostov-on-Don]] (''RND Control'') by telephone and requested clearance to transfer the flight to Russian [[airspace]]. After obtaining the permission, ''Dnipro Control'' attempted to contact MH17 for handing them off to ''RND Control'' at 16:20 local time (13:20&nbsp;UTC), but the aircraft did not respond. When MH17 did not respond to several calls, ''Dnipro Control'' contacted ''RND Control'' again to check if they could see the aircraft on their radar.

Lt. Gen. Nikolai Parshin, chief of the Missile and Artillery Directorate, said that after Dutch investigators displayed parts of the missile and their serial numbers, they studied and declassified archives at the research center that produced the Buk missiles. Parshin said the Russian archives show that the missile that was made of these parts was transported to a military unit in western Ukraine in 1986, and to Russia's knowledge never left Ukraine. Officials also claimed that video evidence presented by the Joint Investigation Team (JIT), in which the missile that allegedly shot down the airplane was shown being moved from Russia into Ukraine, was fabricated.<ref>{{cite news |url= https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2018/09/17/world/europe/ap-eu-russia-mh17.html |title= Russia: Missile That Shot Down Flight MH17 Was Ukrainian |date= 17 September 2018 |work= The New York Times}}</ref>\n\nJIT responded that it had requested details about recovered missile parts from Russia in May 2018, but had received no answer.

It depicts Spiegelman interviewing his father about his experiences as a [[History of the Jews in Poland|Polish Jew]] and [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]] survivor.  The work employs [[postmodernism|postmodernist]] techniques and represents Jews as mice, Germans as cats, and Poles as pigs<!-- please do not add to this list -->.  Critics have classified ''Maus'' as memoir, biography, history, fiction, autobiography, or a mix of genres.  In 1992, it became the first graphic novel to win a [[Pulitzer Prize]] (the [[Pulitzer Prize Special Citations and Awards|Special Award in Letters]]).hi\n\nIn the [[Frame story|frame-tale]] timeline in the narrative present that begins in 1978 in New York City, Spiegelman talks with his father Vladek about his Holocaust experiences, gathering material for the ''Maus'' project he is preparing.  In the narrative past, Spiegelman depicts these experiences, from the years leading up to [[World War&nbsp;II]] to his parents' liberation from the [[Nazi concentration camps]]<!-- not just Auschwitz -->.  Much of the story revolves around Spiegelman's troubled relationship with his father, and the absence of his mother, who committed suicide when he was 20.  Her grief-stricken husband destroyed her written accounts of [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]].  The book uses a minimalist drawing style and displays innovation in its pacing, structure, and page layouts.\n\nA three-page strip also called \"Maus\" that he made in 1972 gave Spiegelman an opportunity to interview his father about his life during World War&nbsp;II.  The recorded interviews became the basis for the graphic novel, which Spiegelman began in 1978.  He serialized ''Maus'' from 1980 until 1991 as an insert in ''[[Raw (magazine)|Raw]]'', an avant-garde comics and graphics magazine published by Spiegelman and his wife, [[Fran\u00e7oise Mouly]], who also appears in ''Maus''.  A collected volume of the first six chapters that appeared in 1986 brought the book mainstream attention; a second volume collected the remaining chapters in 1991. ''Maus'' was one of the first graphic novels to receive significant academic attention in the English-speaking world.\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Synopsis==\nMost of the book weaves in and out of two timelines.  In the [[Frame story|frame tale]] of the narrative present,{{sfnm|1a1=Witek|1y=1989|1p=98|2a1=LaCapra|2y=1998|2p=154}} Spiegelman interviews his father Vladek in the [[Rego Park, Queens|Rego Park]] neighborhood of New York City{{sfn|Fathers|2007|p=122}} in 1978\u201379.{{sfn|Gordon|2004}}  The story that Vladek tells unfolds in the narrative past, which begins in the mid-1930s{{sfn|Fathers|2007|p=122}} and continues until the end of [[the Holocaust]] in 1945.{{sfn|Kannenberg|1999|pp=100\u2013101}}\n\nIn Rego Park in 1958,{{sfn|Gordon|2004}} a young Art Spiegelman is skating with his friends when he falls down and hurts himself, but his friends keep going. When he returns home, he finds his father Vladek, who asks him why he is upset, and Art proceeds to tell him that his friends left him behind. His father responds in broken English, \"Friends? Your friends? If you lock them together in a room with no food for a week, then you could see what it is, friends!\"{{sfn|Liss|1998|p=55}}\n\nAs an adult, Art visits his father, from whom he has become estranged.{{sfn|Levine|2006|p=29}}  Vladek has remarried to a woman called Mala since the suicide of Art's mother Anja in 1968.{{sfnm|1a1=Young|1y=2006|1p=250|2a1=Fathers|2y=2007|2p=123}}  Art asks Vladek to recount his Holocaust experiences.{{sfn|Levine|2006|p=29}}  Vladek tells of his time in the Polish city of [[Cz\u0119stochowa]]{{sfn|Merino|2010}} and how he came to marry into Anja's wealthy family in 1937 and move to [[Sosnowiec]] to become a manufacturer.  Vladek begs Art not to include this in the book and Art reluctantly agrees.{{sfn|Pekar|1986|p=54}}  Anja suffers a breakdown due to [[postpartum depression]]{{sfn|Reibmann|2001|p=26}} after giving birth to their first son Richieu,{{efn|Spelled \"Rysio\" in Polish.  \"Richieu\" is Spiegelman's misspelling, as he had not previously seen his brother's name written down.{{sfn|Spiegelman|2011|p=18}} }} and the couple go to a sanitarium in Nazi-occupied Czechoslovakia for her to recover.  After they return, political and [[Antisemitism|anti-Semitic]] tensions build until Vladek is [[Conscription|drafted]] just before the [[Invasion of Poland|Nazi invasion]].  Vladek is captured at the front and forced to work as a [[prisoner of war]].  After his release, he finds Germany has [[Polish areas annexed by Nazi Germany|annexed Sosnowiec]] and he is dropped off on the other side of the border in the [[General Government|German protectorate]].  He sneaks across the border and reunites with his family.{{sfn|Wood|1997|p=83}}\n\n[[File:Maus page 103 panel 2 HITLER DID IT.png|thumb|left|upright|alt=Comics panel.

Mala had tried to hide it, but Vladek finds and reads it.  In \"Prisoner on the Hell Planet\",{{sfn|Levine|2006|p=36}} Art is traumatized by his mother's suicide three months after his release from the [[Psychiatric hospital|mental hospital]], and in the end depicts himself behind bars saying, \"You ''murdered'' me, Mommy, and left me here to take the rap!\"{{sfnm|1a1=Witek|1y=1989|1p=100|2a1=Levine|2y=2006|2p=38}}  Though it brings back painful memories, Vladek admits that dealing with the issue in such a way was for the best.{{sfn|Kaplan|2006|p=114}}\n\nIn 1943, the Nazis move the Jews of the [[Sosnowiec Ghetto]] to Srodula and march them back to Sosnowiec to work.  The family splits up\u2014Vladek and Anja send Richieu to [[Zawiercie]] to stay with an aunt for safety.  As more Jews are sent from the ghettos to Auschwitz, the aunt poisons herself, her children and Richieu to escape the [[Gestapo]].  In Srodula, many Jews build bunkers to hide from the Germans.  Vladek's bunker is discovered and he is placed into a \"ghetto inside the ghetto\" surrounded by [[barbed wire]].  The remnants of Vladek and Anja's family are taken away.{{sfn|Wood|1997|p=83}}  Srodula is cleared of its Jews, except for a group Vladek hides with in another bunker.  When the Germans depart, the group splits up and leaves the ghetto.{{sfn|Wood|1997|p=84}}\n\nIn Sosnowiec, Vladek and Anja move from one hiding place to the next, making occasional contact with other Jews in hiding.  Vladek disguises himself as an ethnic Pole and hunts for provisions.  The couple arrange with smugglers to escape to Hungary, but it is a trick\u2014the Gestapo arrest them on the train (as Hungary is invaded) and take them to [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]], where they are separated until after the war.{{sfn|Wood|1997|p=84}}\n\nArt asks after Anja's diaries, which Vladek tells him were her account of her Holocaust experiences and the only record of what happened to her after her separation from Vladek at Auschwitz and which Vladek says she had wanted Art to read.  Vladek comes to admit that he burned them after she killed herself.  Art is enraged and calls Vladek a \"murderer\".{{sfnm|1a1=Levine|1y=2006|1p=34|2a1=Rothberg|2y=2000|2p=211}}\n\nThe story jumps to 1986, after the first six chapters of ''Maus'' have appeared in a collected edition.  Art is overcome with the unexpected attention the book receives{{sfn|Kannenberg|1999|pp=100\u2013101}} and finds himself \"totally blocked\".  Art talks about the book with his psychiatrist Paul Pavel, a Czech Holocaust survivor.{{sfn|Weine|2006|p=29}}  Pavel suggests that, as those who perished in the camps can never tell their stories, \"maybe it's better not to have any more stories\".  Art replies with a quote from [[Samuel Beckett]]: \"Every word is like an unnecessary stain on silence and nothingness\", but then realizes, \"on the other hand, he ''said'' it\".{{sfn|Rothberg|2000|p=217}}\n\nVladek tells of his hardship in the camps, of starvation and abuse, of his resourcefulness, of avoiding the {{lang|de|selektionen}}\u2014the process by which prisoners were selected for further labor or execution.{{sfn|McGlothlin|2003|p=177}}  Despite the danger, Anja and Vladek exchange occasional messages.  As the war progresses and the German front is pushed back, the prisoners are marched from Auschwitz in occupied Poland to [[Gross-Rosen concentration camp|Gross-Rosen]] within the Reich and then to [[Dachau concentration camp|Dachau]], where the hardships only increase and Vladek catches [[typhus]].{{sfnm|1a1=McGlothlin|1y=2006|1p=85|2a1=Adams|2y=2008|2p=172}}\n\nThe war ends, the camp survivors are freed and Vladek and Anja reunite.  The book closes with Vladek turning over in his bed as he finishes his story and telling Art, \"I'm tired from talking, Richieu, and it's enough stories for now.\"{{sfnm|1a1=Kois|1y=2011|2a1=Wood|2y=1997|2p=88}}  The final image is of Vladek and Anja's tombstone{{sfn|Mandel|2006|p=118}}\u2014Vladek died in 1982, before the book was completed.{{sfn|Wood|1997|p=85}}\n\n==Primary characters==\n\n{{glossary}}\n\n{{term|Art Spiegelman}}\n\n{{defn|Art{{efn|Born Itzhak Avraham ben Zev; his name was changed to Arthur Isadore when he immigrated with his parents to the U.S..{{sfn|Spiegelman|2011|p=17}} }} (born 1948){{sfn|Spiegelman|2011|p=292}} is a [[cartoonist]] and [[intellectual]].{{sfn|Gordon|2004}} Art is presented as angry and full of self-pity.{{sfn|Gordon|2004}} He deals with his own traumas and those inherited from his parents by seeking psychiatric help,{{sfn|Reibmann|2001|p=26}} which continued after the book was completed.{{sfn|Fathers|2007|p=124}} He has a strained relationship with his father, Vladek,{{sfnm|1a1=Young|1y=2006|1p=250|2a1=Fathers|2y=2007|2p=123|3a1=Levine|3y=2006|3p=29}} by whom he feels dominated.{{sfn|Gordon|2004}} At first, he displays little sympathy for his father's hardships, but shows more as the narrative unfolds.{{sfn|Harvey|1996|p=242}} }}\n\n{{term|Vladek Spiegelman}}\n\n{{defn|Vladek{{efn|Born Zev Spiegelman, with the [[Jewish surname|Hebrew name]] Zev ben Abraham.

An aunt poisoned their first son Richieu to avoid capture by the Nazis four years before Spiegelman's birth.{{sfn|Kois|2011}}  He and his parents emigrated to the United States in 1951.{{sfn|Fischer|Fischer|2002}}  During his youth his mother occasionally talked about Auschwitz, but his father did not want him to know about it.{{sfn|Fathers|2007|p=124}}\n\nSpiegelman developed an interest in comics early and began drawing professionally at 16.{{sfnm|1a1=Fathers|1y=2007|1p=122|2a1=Weiner|2y=2003|2p=36}}  He spent a month in [[New York State Inebriate Asylum|Binghamton State Mental Hospital]] in 1968 after a [[Mental breakdown|nervous breakdown]].  Shortly after he got out, his mother committed suicide.{{sfn|Fathers|2007|p=122}}  Spiegelman's father was not happy with his son's involvement in the [[hippie]] subculture.  Spiegelman said that when he bought himself a German [[Volkswagen]] it damaged their already-strained relationship \"beyond repair\".{{sfn|Fathers|2007|p=125}}  Around this time, Spiegelman read in [[fanzine]]s about such graphic artists as [[Frans Masereel]] who had made [[wordless novel]]s.  The discussions in those fanzines about making the [[Great American Novel]] in comics inspired him.{{sfn|Kaplan|2008|p=171}}\n\n[[File:Art Spiegelman - Maus (1972) page 1 panel 3.png|left|thumb|alt=Cartoon image of a Nazi cat holding a gun to a Jewish mouse's head|From the original, more detailed 1972 \"Maus\" strip]]\n\nSpiegelman became a key figure in the underground comix movement of the 1970s, both as cartoonist and editor.{{sfn|Witek|1989|p=103}}  In 1972 [[Justin Green (cartoonist)|Justin Green]] produced the semi-autobiographical comic book ''[[Binky Brown Meets the Holy Virgin Mary]]'', which inspired other underground cartoonists to produce more personal and revealing work.{{sfn|Chute|2010|p=18}}  The same year, Green asked Spiegelman to contribute a three-page strip for a comic named ''[[Funny Aminals]]''{{sic|}}, which Green edited.{{sfn|Witek|1989|p=103}}  Spiegelman wanted to do a strip about racism, and at first considered focusing on African Americans,{{sfn|Kaplan|2008|p=140}} with cats as [[Ku Klux Klan]] members chasing African-American mice.{{sfn|Conan|2011|p=}}  Instead, he turned to the Holocaust and depicted Nazi cats persecuting Jewish mice in a strip he titled \"Maus\".  The tale was narrated to a mouse named \"[[Mickey Mouse|Mickey]]\".{{sfn|Witek|1989|p=103}}  After finishing the strip, Spiegelman visited his father to show him the finished work, which he had based in part on an anecdote he had heard about his father's Auschwitz experience.  His father gave him further background information, which piqued Spiegelman's interest.  Spiegelman recorded a series of interviews over four days with his father, which was to provide the basis of the longer ''Maus''.{{sfn|Spiegelman|2011|pp=22\u201324}}  Spiegelman followed up with extensive research, reading survivors' accounts and talking to friends and family who had also survived.  He got detailed information about Sosnowiec from a series of Polish pamphlets published after the war which detailed what happened to the Jews by region.{{sfn|Brown|1988}}\n\n[[File:Auschwitz entrance.JPG|right|thumb|alt=Auschwitz entrance|Spiegelman visited Auschwitz in 1979 as part of his research.]]\n\nIn 1973, Spiegelman produced a strip for ''Short Order Comix'' #1{{sfn|Witek|1989|p=98}} about his mother's suicide called \"Prisoner on the Hell Planet\".  The same year, he edited a [[Pornography|pornographic]], [[Psychedelia|psychedelic]] book of quotations, and dedicated it to his mother.{{sfn|Rothberg|2000|p=214}}  He spent the rest of the 1970s building his reputation making short [[avant-garde]] comics.  He moved back to New York from San Francisco in 1975, which he admitted to his father only in 1977, by which time he had decided to work on a \"very long comic book\".{{sfn|Kaplan|2006|p=114}}  He began another series of interviews with his father in 1978,{{sfn|Fathers|2007|p=125}} and visited Auschwitz in 1979.{{sfn|Blau|2008}}  He serialized the story in a comics and graphics magazine he and his wife Mouly began in 1980 called ''Raw''.{{sfn|Petersen|2010|p=221}}\n\n===Comics medium===\n\n[[American comic book]]s were big business with a diversity of genres in the 1940s and 1950s,{{sfn|Weiner|2003|pp=5\u20136}} but had reached a low ebb by the late 1970s.{{sfn|Duncan|Smith|2009|p=68}}  By the time ''Maus'' began serialization, the \"Big Two\" comics publishers, [[Marvel Comics|Marvel]] and [[DC Comics]], dominated the industry with mostly [[superhero]] titles.{{sfn|Duncan|Smith|2009|p=91}}  The [[underground comix]] movement that had flourished in the late 1960s and early 1970s also seemed moribund.{{sfn|Witek|2004}}  The public perception of comic books was as adolescent power fantasies, inherently incapable of mature artistic or literary expression.{{sfnm|1a1=Russell|1y=2008|1p=221|2a1=Duncan|2a2=Smith|2y=2009|2p=1}}  Most discussion focused on comics as a genre rather than as a medium.{{sfnm|1a1=Witek|1y=2004|2a1=Fagan|2a2=Fagan|2y=2011|2p=3|3a1=Abell|3y=2012|3pp=68\u201384}}\n\n''Maus'' came to prominence when the term \"[[graphic novel]]\" was beginning to gain currency.  [[Will Eisner]] popularized the term with the publication in 1978 of ''[[A Contract with God]]''.  The term was used partly to mask the low cultural status that comics had in the English-speaking world, and partly because the term \"comic book\" was being used to refer to short-form periodicals, leaving no accepted vocabulary with which to talk about book-form comics.{{sfn|Petersen|2010|p=222}}\n\n==Publication history==\n\nThe first chapter of ''Maus'' appeared in December 1980 in the second issue of ''Raw''{{sfn|Kaplan|2008|p=171}} as a small insert; a new chapter appeared in each issue until the magazine came to an end in 1991.  Every chapter but the last appeared in ''Raw''.{{sfn|Kaplan|2006|p=113}}\n\nSpiegelman struggled to find a publisher for a book edition of ''Maus'',{{sfn|Kois|2011}} but after a rave ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' review of the serial in August 1986, [[Pantheon Books]] published the first six chapters in a volume{{sfnm|1a1=Kaplan|1y=2008|1p=171|2a1=Kaplan|2y=2006|2p=118}} called ''Maus: A Survivor's Tale'' and subtitled ''My Father Bleeds History''.  Spiegelman was relieved that the book's publication preceded the theatrical release of the animated film ''[[An American Tail]]'' by three months, as he believed that the film, produced by [[Steven Spielberg]]'s [[Amblin Entertainment]], was inspired by ''Maus'' and wished to avoid comparisons with it.{{sfnm|1a1=Kaplan|1y=2006|1p=118|2a1=Kaplan|2y=2008|2p=172}}\n\nThe book found a large audience, partly because of its distribution through bookstores rather than the [[direct market]] comic shops where comic books were normally sold.{{sfn|Kaplan|2006|p=115}}  ''Maus'' was difficult for critics and reviewers to classify, and also for booksellers, who needed to know on which shelves to place it.  Though Pantheon pushed for the term \"graphic novel\", Spiegelman was not comfortable with this, as many book-length comics were being referred to as \"graphic novels\" whether or not they had novelistic qualities.  He suspected the term's use was an attempt to validate the comics form, rather than to describe the content of the books.{{sfn|Petersen|2010|p=222}}  Spiegelman later came to accept the term, and with [[Drawn and Quarterly]] publisher Chris Oliveros successfully lobbied the [[Book Industry Study Group]] in the early 2000s to include \"graphic novel\" as a category in bookstores.{{sfnm|1a1=McGrath|1y=2004|1p=2|2a1=Morman|2y=2003}}\n\nPantheon collected the last five chapters in 1991 in a second volume subtitled ''And Here My Troubles Began''.  Pantheon later collected the two volumes into soft- and hardcover two-volume boxed sets and single-volume editions.{{sfn|Rhoades|2008|p=220}}  In 1994 the [[Voyager Company]] released ''The Complete Maus'' on [[CD-ROM]], a collection which contained the original comics, Vladek's taped transcripts, filmed interviews, sketches, and other background material.{{sfn|Horowitz|1997|p=403}}  The CD-ROM was based on [[HyperCard]], a [[Macintosh]]-only application that has since become obsolete.{{sfn|Hignite|2007|p=57}}  In 2011 Pantheon Books published a companion to ''The Complete Maus'' entitled ''[[MetaMaus]]'', with further background material, including filmed footage of Vladek.{{sfn|Kois|2011}}  The centerpiece of the book is a Spiegelman interview conducted by [[Hillary Chute]]. It also has interviews with Spiegelman's wife and children, sketches, photographs, family trees, assorted artwork, and a DVD with video, audio, photos, and an interactive version of ''Maus''.{{sfn|Garner|2011}}\n\nSpiegelman dedicated ''Maus'' to his brother Richieu and his first daughter [[Nadja Spiegelman|Nadja]].{{sfnm|1a1=Liss|1y=1998|1p=55|2a1=LaCapra|2y=1998|2p=156}}  The book's [[epigraph (literature)|epigraph]] is a quote from [[Adolf Hitler]]: \"The Jews are undoubtedly a race, but they are not human.\"{{sfnm|1a1=Witek|1y=1989|1p=94|2a1=Hirsch|2y=1997|2p=26|3a1=Wirth-Nesher|3y=2006|3p=169}}\n\n===International publication===\n\n[[Penguin Books]] obtained the rights to publish the initial volume in the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] in 1986.

Three translations were particularly important to Spiegelman: French, as his wife was French, and because of his respect for the sophisticated [[Franco-Belgian comics]] tradition; German, given the book's background; and [[Polish language|Polish]].  Poland was the setting for most of the book and Polish was the language of his parents and his own [[First language|mother tongue]].{{sfnm|1a1=Weschler|1y=2001|2a1=Spiegelman|2y=2011|2pp=122\u2013125}}  The publishers of the German edition had to convince the German culture ministry of the work's serious intent to have the swastika appear on the cover, per [[Strafgesetzbuch section 86a|laws prohibiting the display of Nazi symbolism]].{{sfn|Gambino|2015}}  Reception in Germany was positive\u2014''Maus'' was a best-seller and was taught in schools.  The Polish translation encountered difficulties; as early as 1987, when Spiegelman planned a research visit to Poland, the Polish consulate official who approved his visa questioned him about the Poles' depiction as pigs and pointed out how serious an insult it was.  Publishers and commentators refused to deal with the book for fear of protests and boycotts.{{sfnm|1a1=Weschler|1y=2001|2a1=Spiegelman|2y=2011|2pp=122\u2013125}}  [[Piotr Bikont]], a journalist for {{lang|pl|[[Gazeta Wyborcza]]}}, set up his own publishing house to publish ''Maus'' in Polish in 2001.

Bikont's response was to don a pig mask and wave to the protesters from the office windows.{{sfn|Spiegelman|2011|pp=122\u2013124}}  The magazine-sized Japanese translation was the only authorized edition with larger pages.{{sfn|Spiegelman|2011|p=152}}  Long-standing plans for an [[Arabic language|Arabic]] translation have yet to come to fruition.{{sfn|Conan|2011}}  A Russian law passed in December 2014 prohibiting the display of Nazi propaganda led to the removal of ''Maus'' from Russian bookstores leading up to [[Victory Day (9 May)|Victory Day]] due to the swastika appearing on the book's cover.{{sfn|Gambino|2015}}\n\nA few panels were changed for the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] edition of ''Maus''.  Based on Vladek's memory, Spiegelman portrayed one of the minor characters as a member of the Nazi-installed Jewish Police.  An [[Israelis|Israeli]] descendant objected and threatened to sue for [[Defamation|libel]].  Spiegelman redrew the character with a [[fedora]] in place of his original police hat, but appended a note to the volume voicing his objection to this \"intrusion\".{{sfnm|1a1=Mozzocco|1y=2011|2a1=Spiegelman|2y=2011|2p=154}}  This version of the first volume appeared in 1990 from the publishing house [[Kinneret Zmora-Bitan Dvir|Zmora Bitan]].

It examines the choices Spiegelman made in the retelling of his father's memories, and the artistic choices he had to make\u2014for example, when his French wife [[Conversion to Judaism|converts to Judaism]], Spiegelman's character frets over whether to depict her as a frog, a mouse, or another animal.{{sfnm|1a1=Young|1y=2006|1p=250|2a1=Witek|2y=1989|2pp=112\u2013114}}\n\nThe book portrays humans with the heads and tails of different species of animals; Jews are drawn as mice and other Germans and Poles as cats and pigs,<!-- PLEASE DO NOT ADD TO THIS LIST! -->{{sfn|Fathers|2007|p=122}} among others.  Spiegelman took advantage of the way [[Nazi propaganda films]] depicted Jews as vermin,{{sfn|Pustz|2007|p=69}} though he was first struck by the metaphor after attending a presentation where [[Ken Jacobs]] showed films of [[minstrel show]]s along with early American animated films, abundant with racial caricatures.{{sfn|Loman|2010|pp=221\u2013223}}  Spiegelman derived the mouse as symbol for the Jew from Nazi propaganda, emphasized in a quote from a German newspaper in the 1930s that prefaces the second volume: \"Mickey Mouse is the most miserable idea ever revealed&nbsp;... Healthy emotions tell every independent young man and every honorable youth that the dirty and filth-covered vermin, the greatest bacteria carrier in the animal kingdom, cannot be the ideal type of animal&nbsp;... Away with Jewish brutalization of the people!  Down with Mickey Mouse!  Wear the Swastika Cross!\"{{sfn|Hungerford|2003|p=87}}\n\nJewish characters try to [[Passing (racial identity)|pass themselves off]] as ethnic Poles by tying pig masks to their faces, with the strings showing at the back.{{sfn|Witek|1989|p=106}}  Vladek's disguise was more convincing than Anja's\u2014\"you could see she was more Jewish\", Vladek says.

According to art historian [[Andrea Liss]], this may paradoxically enable the reader to identify with the characters as human, preventing the reader from observing racial characteristics based on facial traits, while reminding readers that racist classification is ever present.{{sfn|Liss|1998|p=53}}\n\nIn making people of each ethnicity look alike, Spiegelman hoped to show the absurdity of dividing people along such lines.  Spiegelman has stated that \"these metaphors&nbsp;... are meant to self-destruct\"{{sfn|Bolhafner|1991|p=96}} and \"reveal the inanity of the notion itself\".{{sfn|Hays|2011}}  Professor [[Amy Hungerford]] saw no consistent system to the animal metaphor.{{sfn|Hungerford|2003|p=86}}  Rather, it signified the characters' roles in the story rather than their races\u2014the [[gentile]] Fran\u00e7oise is a mouse because of her identification with her husband, who identifies with the Holocaust victims.  When asked what animal he would make [[Israeli Jews]], Spiegelman suggests [[porcupine]]s.{{sfn|Hungerford|2003|p=87}}  When Art visits his [[psychiatrist]], the two wear mouse masks.{{sfn|Pustz|2007|p=70}}  Spiegelman's perceptions of the animal metaphor seem to have evolved over the book's making\u2014in the original publication of the first volume, his self-portrait showed a mouse head on a human body, but by the time the second volume arrived, his self-portrait had become that of a man wearing a mouse mask.{{sfn|Hirsch|1997|p=27}}  In ''Maus'', the characters seem to be mice and cats only in their predator/prey relationship. In every respect other than their heads and tails, they act and speak as ordinary humans.{{sfn|Hirsch|1997|p=27}} Further complicating the animal metaphor, Anja is ironically shown to be afraid of mice, while other characters appear with pet dogs and cats, and the Nazis with attack dogs.{{sfn|Wolk|2008|p=283}}\n\n===Memory===\n\nTo [[Marianne Hirsch]], Spiegelman's life is \"dominated by memories that are not his own\".{{sfn|Hirsch|1997|p=26}}  His work is one not of memory but of ''postmemory''\u2014a term she coined after encountering ''Maus''.  This describes the relation of the children of survivors with the survivors themselves.  While these children have not had their parents' experiences, they grow up with their parents' memories\u2014the memory of another's memory\u2014until the stories become so powerful that for these children they become memories in their own right.  The children's proximity creates a \"deep personal connection\" with the memory, though separated from it by \"generational distance\".{{sfnm|1a1=Levine|1y=2006|1p=17|2a1=Berger|2y=1999|2p=231}}\n\nArt tried to keep his father's story chronological, because otherwise he would \"never keep it straight\".{{sfnm|1a1=Merino|1y=2010|2a1=Weine|2y=2006|2p=27|3a1=Brown|3y=1988}}  His mother Anja's memories are conspicuously absent from the narrative, given her suicide and Vladek's destruction of her diaries.  Hirsch sees ''Maus'' in part as an attempt to reconstruct her memory.  Vladek keeps her memory alive with the pictures on his desk, \"like a shrine\", according to Mala.{{sfn|Hirsch|1997|p=33\u201334}}\n\n===Guilt===\n\nSpiegelman displays his sense of guilt in many ways.  He suffers anguish over his dead brother, Richieu, who perished in the Holocaust, and whom he feels he can never live up to.{{sfn|Schwab|2010|p=37}}  The eighth chapter, made after the publication and unexpected success of the first volume, opens with a guilt-ridden Spiegelman (now in human form, with a strapped-on mouse mask) atop a pile of corpses\u2014the corpses of the six million Jews upon whom ''Maus''{{'}} success was built.{{sfn|Kannenberg|2001|p=86}}  He is told by his psychiatrist that his father feels guilt for having survived and for outliving his first son,{{sfn|Schuldiner|2011|p=69}} and that some of Art's guilt may spring from painting his father in such an unflattering way.{{sfn|Schuldiner|2011|p=70}} As he had not lived in the camps himself, he finds it difficult to understand or visualize this \"separate universe\", and feels inadequate in portraying it.{{sfn|Fathers|2007|p=124}}{{sfn|Schuldiner|2011|p=75}}\n\n===Racism===\n\n[[File:Oberkapo - Armbinde.jpg|alt=Kapo armband|right|thumb|[[Kapo (concentration camp)|Kapo]]s, prisoner supervisors under the Nazis, are depicted as antisemitic Poles.]]\n\nSpiegelman parodies the Nazis' vision of racial divisions; Vladek's racism is also put on display when he becomes upset that Fran\u00e7oise would pick up a black hitchhiker, a \"[[List of ethnic slurs#S|schwartser]]\" as he says.  When she berates him, a victim of antisemitism, for his attitude, he replies, \"It's not even to compare, the schwartsers and the Jews!\"{{sfn|Loman|2010|p=224}}  Spiegelman gradually deconstructs the animal metaphor throughout the book, especially in the second volume, showing where the lines cannot be drawn between races of humans.{{sfn|Loman|2010|p=225}}\n\nThe Germans are depicted with little difference between them, but there is great variety among the Poles and Jews who dominate the story.{{sfn|LaCapra|1998|pp=161}}  Sometimes Jews and the Jewish councils are shown complying with the occupiers; some trick other Jews into capture, while others act as police for the Nazis.{{sfn|LaCapra|1998|pp=167\u2013168}}\n\nSpiegelman shows numerous instances of Poles who risked themselves to aid Jews, and also shows antisemitism as being rife among them. The [[kapo (concentration camp)|kapo]]s who run the camps are Poles, and Anja and Vladek are tricked by Polish smugglers into the hands of the Nazis. Anja and Vladek hear stories that Poles continue to drive off and even kill returning Jews after the war.{{sfn|LaCapra|1998|pp=166\u2013167}}\n\n===Language===\n\nVladek's English is broken in contrast with that of Art's more fluent therapist, Paul Pavel, who is also an immigrant and Holocaust survivor.{{sfn|Rosen|2005|p=158}}  Vladek's knowledge of the language helps him several times during the story, as when he uses it to meet Anja. He also uses it to befriend a Frenchman, and continues to correspond with him in English after the war. His recounting of the Holocaust, first to American soldiers, then to his son, is never in his mother tongue,{{sfn|Rosen|2005|p=165}} and English becomes his daily language when he moves to America.{{sfn|Rosen|2005|p=166}}  His difficulty with his second language is revealed as Art writes his dialogue in broken English;{{sfn|Rosen|2005|p=164}} when Vladek is imprisoned he tells Art, \"[E]very day we prayed&nbsp;... I was very religious, and it wasn't else to do\".{{sfn|Wirth-Nesher|2006|p=168}}  Late in the book, Vladek talks of Dachau, saying, \"And here&nbsp;... my troubles began\", though clearly his troubles had begun long before Dachau. This unidiomatic expression was used as the subtitle of the second volume.{{sfn|Rosen|2005|p=164}}\n\nThe German word ''Maus'' is [[cognate]] to the English word \"mouse\",{{sfn|Levine|2006|p=21}} and also reminiscent of the German verb ''mauscheln'', which means \"to speak like a Jew\"{{sfn|Levine|2006|p=22}} and refers to the way Jews from [[Eastern Europe]] spoke German{{sfn|Rothberg|2000|p=208}}\u2014a word not [[Etymology|etymologically]] related to ''Maus'', but distantly to ''[[Moses]]''.{{sfn|Levine|2006|p=22}}\n\n==Style==\n\n[[File:Atomic Mouse issue 6 cover.jpg|thumb|right|upright|alt=Cover of comic book Atomic Mouse|Spiegelman's use of [[funny animal]]s, similar to those shown here, conflicted with readers' expectations.]]\n\nSpiegelman's perceived audacity in using the Holocaust as his subject was compounded by his telling the story in comics.  The prevailing view in the English-speaking world held comics as inherently trivial,{{sfn|Russell|2008|p=221}} thus degrading Spiegelman's subject matter, especially as he used animal heads in place of recognizably human ones.{{sfn|Witek|1989|p=97}}  [[Funny animal]]s have been a staple of comics, and while they have a traditional reputation as children's fare, the underground had long made use of them in adult stories,{{sfn|Witek|1989|p=110}} for example in [[Robert Crumb]]'s [[Fritz the Cat]], which comics critic Joseph Witek asserts shows that the genre could \"open up the way to a paradoxical narrative realism\" that ''Maus'' exploited.{{sfn|Witek|1989|p=111}}\n\nOstensibly about the Holocaust, the story entwines with the frame tale of Art interviewing and interacting with his father.  Art's \"Prisoner on the Hell Planet\" is also encompassed by the frame, and stands in visual and thematical contrast with the rest of the book as the characters are in human form{{sfn|Witek|1989|p=98}} in a [[Surrealism|surreal]], [[German Expressionism|German Expressionist]] [[woodcut]] style inspired by [[Lynd Ward]].{{sfn|Witek|2004|p=100}}\n\nSpiegelman blurs the line between the frame and the world, such as when neurotically trying to deal with what ''Maus'' is becoming for him, he says to his wife, \"In real life you'd never have let me talk this long without interrupting.\"{{sfn|Liss|1998|p=54}}  When a prisoner whom the Nazis believe to be a Jew claims to be German, Spiegelman has difficulty deciding whether to present this character as a cat or a mouse.{{sfn|Kannenberg|2001|p=85}}  Throughout the book, Spiegelman incorporates and highlights banal details from his father's tales, sometimes humorous or ironic, giving a lightness and humanity to the story which \"helps carry the weight of the unbearable historical realities\".{{sfn|Liss|1998|p=55}}\n\nSpiegelman started taking down his interviews with Vladek on paper, but quickly switched to a tape recorder,{{sfn|Rothberg|2000|pp=207\u2013208}} face-to-face or over the phone.{{sfn|Brown|1988}}  Spiegelman often condensed Vladek's words, and occasionally added to the dialogue{{sfn|Rothberg|2000|pp=207\u2013208}} or synthesized multiple retellings into a single portrayal.{{sfn|Brown|1988}}\n\nSpiegelman worried about the effect that his organizing of Vladek's story would have on its authenticity.  In the end, he eschewed a [[Joycean]] approach and settled on a linear narrative he thought would be better at \"getting things across\".{{sfn|Brown|1988}}  He strove to present how the book was recorded and organized as an integral part of the book itself, expressing the \"sense of an interview shaped by a relationship\".{{sfn|Brown|1988}}\n\n===Artwork===\n\nThe story is text-driven, with few wordless [[Panel (comics)|panels]]{{sfn|Kannenberg|1999|pp=100\u2013101}} in its 1,500 black-and-white panels.{{sfn|Weine|2006|pp=25\u201326}}  The art has high contrast, with heavy black areas and thick black borders balanced against areas of white and wide white margins.  There is little gray in the shading.{{sfn|Adams|2008|p=172}}  In the narrative present, the pages are arranged in eight-panel grids; in the narrative past, Spiegelman found himself \"violating the grid constantly\" with his page layouts.{{sfn|Weine|2006|p=26}}\n\nSpiegelman rendered the original three-page \"Maus\" and \"Prisoner on the Hell Planet\" in highly detailed, expressive styles.  Spiegelman planned to draw ''Maus'' in such a manner, but after initial sketches he decided to use a pared-down style, one little removed from his pencil sketches, which he found more direct and immediate.  Characters are rendered in a minimalist way: animal heads with dots for eyes and slashes for eyebrows and mouths, sitting on humanoid bodies.{{sfn|Pekar|1986|p=56}}  Spiegelman wanted to get away from the rendering of the characters in the original \"Maus\", in which oversized cats towered over the Jewish mice, an approach which Spiegelman says, \"tells you how to feel, tells you how to think\".{{sfn|Witek|1989|p=104}}  He preferred to let the reader make independent moral judgments.{{sfn|Witek|1989|p=112}}  He drew the cat-Nazis the same size as the mouse-Jews, and dropped the stereotypical villainous expressions.{{sfn|Witek|1989|p=106}}\n\nSpiegelman wanted the artwork to have a diary feel to it, and so drew the pages on [[stationery]] with a fountain pen and typewriter [[correction fluid]].  It was reproduced at the same size it was drawn, unlike his other work, which was usually drawn larger and shrunk down, which hides defects in the art.{{sfn|Conan|2011}}\n\n===Influences===\n\n[[File:Frans Masereel - Passionate Journey -- two pages.jpg|thumb|alt=Two pages from a woodcut novel by Frans Masereel|Wordless [[woodcut]] novels such as those by [[Frans Masereel]] were an early influence on Spiegelman.]]\n\nSpiegelman has published articles promoting a greater knowledge of his medium's history.

Spiegelman stated, \"without ''Binky Brown'', there would be no ''Maus''\".{{sfn|Chute|2010|p=18}}  Among the graphic artists who influenced ''Maus'', Spiegelman cited [[Frans Masereel]], who had made early [[wordless novel]]s in [[woodcut]]s such as ''[[Passionate Journey]]'' (1919).{{sfn|Kaplan|2008|p=171}}\n\n==Reception and legacy==\n\nSpiegelman's work as cartoonist and editor had long been known and respected in the comics community, but the media attention after the first volume's publication in 1986 was unexpected.{{sfn|Weiner|2003|p=36}}  Hundreds of overwhelmingly positive reviews appeared, and ''Maus'' became the center of new attention focused on comics.{{sfn|Witek|1989|p=94}}  It was considered one of the \"Big Three\" book-form comics from around 1986\u20131987, along with ''[[Watchmen]]'' and ''[[The Dark Knight Returns]]'', that are said to have brought the term \"graphic novel\" and the idea of comics for adults into mainstream consciousness.{{sfnm|1a1=Kaplan|1y=2008|1p=172|2a1=Sabin|2y=1993|2p=246|3a1=Stringer|3y=1996|3p=262|4a1=Ahrens|4a2=Meteling|4y=2010|4p=1|5a1=Williams|5a2=Lyons|5y=2010|5p=7}}  It was credited with changing the public's perception of what comics could be{{sfn|Witek|1989|pp=94\u201395}} at a time when, in the English-speaking world, they were considered to be for children, and strongly associated with superheroes.{{sfn|Witek|2004}}  Initially, critics of ''Maus'' showed a reluctance to include comics in literary discourse.{{sfnm|1a1=Russell|1y=2008|1p=223|2a1=Horowitz|2y=1997|2p=406}}  ''The New York Times'' intended praise when saying of the book, \"Art Spiegelman doesn't draw comic books\".{{sfnm|1a1=Witek|1y=2004|2a1=Langer|2y=1998}}  After its [[Pulitzer Prize]] win, it won greater acceptance and interest among academics.{{sfn|Russell|2008|p=223}}  The [[Museum of Modern Art]] staged an exhibition on the making of ''Maus'' in 1991\u201392.{{sfnm|1a1=Kaplan|1y=2006|1p=118|2a1=Weine|2y=2006|2p=25}}\n\n[[File:Art Spiegelman (2007).jpg|alt=Art Spiegelman|thumb|left|upright|Spiegelman continues to attract academic attention and influence younger cartoonists.]]\n\n''Maus'' proved difficult to classify to a genre,{{sfnm|1a1=Orb\u00e1n|1y=2005|1pp=39\u201340|2a1=Rhoades|2y=2008|2p=219}} and has been called biography, fiction, autobiography, history, and memoir.{{#tag:ref|For \"biography\", see {{harvnb|Brown|1988}}\n<br />For \"fiction\", see {{harvnb|New York Times staff|1987}}; {{harvnb|Ruth|2011}}\n<br />For \"autobiography\", see {{harvnb|Merino|2010}}\n<br />For \"history\", see {{harvnb|Brown|1988}}; {{harvnb|Ruth|2011}}; {{harvnb|Garner|2011}}\n<br />For \"memoir\", see {{harvnb|Ruth|2011}}; {{harvnb|Garner|2011}} }}  Spiegelman petitioned ''The New York Times'' to move it from \"fiction\" to \"non-fiction\" on the newspaper's bestseller list,{{sfn|Liss|1998|p=54}} saying, \"I shudder to think how [[David Duke]]&nbsp;... would respond to seeing a carefully researched work based closely on my father's memories of life in Hitler's Europe and in the death camps classified as fiction\".

Marianne Hirsch wrote an influential essay on post-memory called \"Family Pictures: ''Maus'', Mourning, and Post-Memory\", later expanded into a book called ''Family Frames: Photography, Narrative, and Postmemory''.  Academics far outside the field of comics such as [[Dominick LaCapra]], [[Linda Hutcheon]], and [[Terrence Des Pres]] took part in the discourse.  Few approached ''Maus'' who were familiar with comics, largely because of the lack of an academic comics tradition\u2014''Maus'' tended to be approached as Holocaust history or from a film or literary perspective.  In 2003, Deborah Geis edited a collection of essays on ''Maus'' called ''Considering ''Maus'': Approaches to Art Spiegelman's \"Survivor's Tale\" of the Holocaust''.{{sfn|Frahm|2004}}  ''Maus'' is considered an important work of [[Holocaust literature]], and studies of it have made significant contributions to [[Holocaust studies]].{{sfn|Loman|2010|p=218}}\n\n[[File:Pekar small.jpg|right|thumb|upright|alt=Harvey Pekar|Comics writer and critic [[Harvey Pekar]] objected to ''Maus''{{'}}s use of animals and the negative depiction of Spiegelman's father.]]\n\nAccording to writer Arie Kaplan, some Holocaust survivors objected to Spiegelman making a comic book out of their tragedy.{{sfn|Kaplan|2006|p=119}}  Literary critics such as [[Hillel Halkin]] objected that the animal metaphor was \"doubly dehumanizing\", reinforcing the Nazi belief that the atrocities were perpetrated by one species on another, when they were actually done by humans against humans.{{sfnm|1a1=Hatfield|1y=2005|1pp=139\u2013140|2a1=Russell|2y=2008|2p=221}}  Comics writer and critic [[Harvey Pekar]] and others{{sfn|Park|2011}} saw Spiegelman's use of animals as potentially reinforcing stereotypes.{{sfnm|1a1=Pekar|1y=1986|1p=55|2a1=Pekar|2y=1990|2pp=32\u201333}}  Pekar was also disdainful of Spiegelman's overwhelmingly negative portrayal of his father,{{sfnm|1a1=Pekar|1y=1986|1p=56|2a1=Pekar|2y=1990|2p=32}} calling him disingenuous and hypocritical for such a portrayal in a book that presents itself as objective.{{sfn|Pekar|1986|p=57}}  Comics critic [[R.&nbsp;C. Harvey]] argued that Spiegelman's animal metaphor threatened \"to erode {{interp|''Maus''{{'}}s}} moral underpinnings\",{{sfn|Harvey|1996|p=243}} and played \"directly into {{interp|the Nazis'}} racist vision\".{{sfn|Harvey|1996|p=244}}\n\nCommentators such as Peter Obst and Lawrence Weschler expressed concern over the Poles' depiction as pigs,{{sfnm|1a1=Obst|1y=, \"A Commentary on Maus by Art Spiegelman\"|2a1=Weschler|2y=2001}} which reviewer [[Marek Kohn]] saw as an ethnic slur{{sfn|Baker|1993|pp=142, 160}} and ''The Norton Anthology of American Literature'' called \"a calculated insult\".{{sfn|Baym|Klinkowitz|Krupat|Wallace|2007|p=3091}} Jewish culture views pigs and pork as non-[[Kashrut|kosher]], or ''unclean''\u2014a point of which the Jewish Spiegelman was unlikely to be ignorant.{{sfnm|1a1=Obst|1y=, \"A Commentary on Maus by Art Spiegelman\"|2a1=Weschler|2y=2001}}  Critics such as Obst and Pekar have said that the portrayal of Poles is unbalanced\u2014that, while some Poles are seen as helping Jews, they are often shown doing so for self-serving reasons.{{sfnm|1a1=Pekar|1y=1990|1pp=32\u201333|2a1=Obst|2y=, \"A Commentary on Maus by Art Spiegelman\"}}  In the late 1990s, an objector to ''Maus''{{'}}s depiction of Poles interrupted a presentation by Spiegelman at Montreal's [[McGill University]] with persistent abuse and was expelled from the auditorium.{{sfn|Surridge|2001|p=37}}\n\nLiterary critic Walter Ben Michaels found Spiegelman's racial divisions \"counterfactual\".{{sfn|Loman|2010|pp=223\u2013224}}  Spiegelman depicts Europeans as different animal species based on Nazi conceptions of race, but all Americans, both black and white, as dogs\u2014with the exception of the Jews, who remain unassimilated mice.  To Michaels, ''Maus'' seems to gloss over the racial inequality that has plagued the history of the U.S.{{sfn|Loman|2010|pp=223\u2013224}}\n\nOther critics, such as Bart Beaty, objected to what they saw as the work's fatalism.{{sfn|Beaty|2012}}\n\nScholar Paul Buhle asserted, \"More than a few readers have described {{interp|''Maus''}} as the most compelling of any {{interp|Holocaust}} depiction, perhaps because only the caricatured quality of comic art is equal to the seeming unreality of an experience beyond all reason.\"{{sfn|Chute|2006|pp=200\u2013201}} Michael Rothberg opined, \"By situating a nonfictional story in a highly mediated, unreal, 'comic' space, Spiegelman captures the hyperintensity of Auschwitz.\"{{sfn|Chute|2006|p=201}}\n\n=== Parodies ===\nBelgian publisher La Cinqui\u00e8me Couche{{sfn|Couvreur|2012}} anonymously produced a book called ''Katz'', a remix of Spiegelman's book with all animal heads replaced with cat heads.  The book reproduced every page and line of dialogue from the French translation of ''Maus''.

It depicts Spiegelman interviewing his father about his experiences as a [[History of the Jews in Poland|Polish Jew]] and [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]] survivor.  The work employs [[postmodernism|postmodernist]] techniques and represents Jews as mice, Germans as cats, and Poles as pigs<!-- please do not add to this list -->.  Critics have classified ''Maus'' as memoir, biography, history, fiction, autobiography, or a mix of genres.  In 1992, it became the first graphic novel to win a [[Pulitzer Prize]] (the [[Pulitzer Prize Special Citations and Awards|Special Award in Letters]]).\n\nIn the [[Frame story|frame-tale]] timeline in the narrative present that begins in 1978 in New York City, Spiegelman talks with his father Vladek about his Holocaust experiences, gathering material for the ''Maus'' project he is preparing.  In the narrative past, Spiegelman depicts these experiences, from the years leading up to [[World War&nbsp;II]] to his parents' liberation from the [[Nazi concentration camps]]<!-- not just Auschwitz -->.  Much of the story revolves around Spiegelman's troubled relationship with his father, and the absence of his mother, who committed suicide when he was 20.  Her grief-stricken husband destroyed her written accounts of [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]].  The book uses a minimalist drawing style and displays innovation in its pacing, structure, and page layouts.\n\nA three-page strip also called \"Maus\" that he made in 1972 gave Spiegelman an opportunity to interview his father about his life during World War&nbsp;II.  The recorded interviews became the basis for the graphic novel, which Spiegelman began in 1978.  He serialized ''Maus'' from 1980 until 1991 as an insert in ''[[Raw (magazine)|Raw]]'', an avant-garde comics and graphics magazine published by Spiegelman and his wife, [[Fran\u00e7oise Mouly]], who also appears in ''Maus''.  A collected volume of the first six chapters that appeared in 1986 brought the book mainstream attention; a second volume collected the remaining chapters in 1991. ''Maus'' was one of the first graphic novels to receive significant academic attention in the English-speaking world.\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Synopsis==\nMost of the book weaves in and out of two timelines.

Shortly after he got out, his mother committed suicide.{{sfn|Fathers|2007|p=122}}  Spiegelman's father was not happy with his son's involvement in the [[hippie]] subculture.  Spiegelman said that when he bought himself a German [[Volkswagen]] it damaged their already-strained relationship \"beyond repair\".{{sfn|Fathers|2007|p=125}}  Around this time, Spiegelman read in [[fanzine]]s about such graphic artists as [[Frans Masereel]] who had made [[wordless novel]]s.  The discussions in those fanzines about making the [[Great American Novel]] in comics inspired him.{{sfn|Kaplan|2008|p=171}}\n\n[[File:Art Spiegelman - Maus (1972) page 1 panel 3.png|left|thumb|alt=Cartoon image of a Nazi cat holding a gun to a Jewish mouse's head|From the original, more detailed 1972 \"Maus\" strip]]\n\nSpiegelman became a key figure in the underground comix movement of the 1970s, both as cartoonist and editor.{{sfn|Witek|1989|p=103}}  In 1972 [[Justin Green (cartoonist)|Justin Green]] produced the semi-autobiographical comic book ''[[Binky Brown Meets the Holy Virgin Mary]]'', which inspired other underground cartoonists to produce more personal and revealing work.{{sfn|Chute|2010|p=18}}  The same year, Green asked Spiegelman to contribute a three-page strip for a comic named ''[[Funny Aminals]]''{{sic|}}, which Green edited.{{sfn|Witek|1989|p=103}}  Spiegelman wanted to do a strip about racism, and at first considered focusing on African Americans,{{sfn|Kaplan|2008|p=140}} with cats as [[Ku Klux Klan]] members chasing African-American mice.{{sfn|Conan|2011|p=}}  Instead, he turned to the Holocaust and depicted Nazi cats persecuting Jewish mice in a strip he titled \"Maus\".  The tale was narrated to a mouse named \"[[Mickey Mouse|Mickey]]\".{{sfn|Witek|1989|p=103}}  After finishing the strip, Spiegelman visited his father to show him the finished work, which he had based in part on an anecdote he had heard about his father's Auschwitz experience.  His father gave him further background information, which piqued Spiegelman's interest.  Spiegelman recorded a series of interviews over four days with his father, which was to provide the basis of the longer ''Maus''.{{sfn|Spiegelman|2011|pp=22\u201324}}  Spiegelman followed up with extensive research, reading survivors' accounts and talking to friends and family who had also survived.  He got detailed information about Sosnowiec from a series of Polish pamphlets published after the war which detailed what happened to the Jews by region.{{sfn|Brown|1988}}\n\n[[File:Auschwitz entrance.JPG|right|thumb|alt=Auschwitz entrance|Spiegelman visited Auschwitz in 1979 as part of his research.]]\n\nIn 1973, Spiegelman produced a strip for ''Short Order Comix'' #1{{sfn|Witek|1989|p=98}} about his mother's suicide called \"Prisoner on the Hell Planet\".  The same year, he edited a [[Pornography|pornographic]], [[Psychedelia|psychedelic]] book of quotations, and dedicated it to his mother.{{sfn|Rothberg|2000|p=214}}  He spent the rest of the 1970s building his reputation making short [[avant-garde]] comics.  He moved back to New York from San Francisco in 1975, which he admitted to his father only in 1977, by which time he had decided to work on a \"very long comic book\".{{sfn|Kaplan|2006|p=114}}  He began another series of interviews with his father in 1978,{{sfn|Fathers|2007|p=125}} and visited Auschwitz in 1979.{{sfn|Blau|2008}}  He serialized the story in a comics and graphics magazine he and his wife Mouly began in 1980 called ''Raw''.{{sfn|Petersen|2010|p=221}}\n\n===Comics medium===\n\n[[American comic book]]s were big business with a diversity of genres in the 1940s and 1950s,{{sfn|Weiner|2003|pp=5\u20136}} but had reached a low ebb by the late 1970s.{{sfn|Duncan|Smith|2009|p=68}}  By the time ''Maus'' began serialization, the \"Big Two\" comics publishers, [[Marvel Comics|Marvel]] and [[DC Comics]], dominated the industry with mostly [[superhero]] titles.{{sfn|Duncan|Smith|2009|p=91}}  The [[underground comix]] movement that had flourished in the late 1960s and early 1970s also seemed moribund.{{sfn|Witek|2004}}  The public perception of comic books was as adolescent power fantasies, inherently incapable of mature artistic or literary expression.{{sfnm|1a1=Russell|1y=2008|1p=221|2a1=Duncan|2a2=Smith|2y=2009|2p=1}}  Most discussion focused on comics as a genre rather than as a medium.{{sfnm|1a1=Witek|1y=2004|2a1=Fagan|2a2=Fagan|2y=2011|2p=3|3a1=Abell|3y=2012|3pp=68\u201384}}\n\n''Maus'' came to prominence when the term \"[[graphic novel]]\" was beginning to gain currency.  [[Will Eisner]] popularized the term with the publication in 1978 of ''[[A Contract with God]]''.  The term was used partly to mask the low cultural status that comics had in the English-speaking world, and partly because the term \"comic book\" was being used to refer to short-form periodicals, leaving no accepted vocabulary with which to talk about book-form comics.{{sfn|Petersen|2010|p=222}}\n\n==Publication history==\n\nThe first chapter of ''Maus'' appeared in December 1980 in the second issue of ''Raw''{{sfn|Kaplan|2008|p=171}} as a small insert; a new chapter appeared in each issue until the magazine came to an end in 1991.  Every chapter but the last appeared in ''Raw''.{{sfn|Kaplan|2006|p=113}}\n\nSpiegelman struggled to find a publisher for a book edition of ''Maus'',{{sfn|Kois|2011}} but after a rave ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' review of the serial in August 1986, [[Pantheon Books]] published the first six chapters in a volume{{sfnm|1a1=Kaplan|1y=2008|1p=171|2a1=Kaplan|2y=2006|2p=118}} called ''Maus: A Survivor's Tale'' and subtitled ''My Father Bleeds History''.  Spiegelman was relieved that the book's publication preceded the theatrical release of the animated film ''[[An American Tail]]'' by three months, as he believed that the film, produced by [[Steven Spielberg]]'s [[Amblin Entertainment]], was inspired by ''Maus'' and wished to avoid comparisons with it.{{sfnm|1a1=Kaplan|1y=2006|1p=118|2a1=Kaplan|2y=2008|2p=172}}\n\nThe book found a large audience, partly because of its distribution through bookstores rather than the [[direct market]] comic shops where comic books were normally sold.{{sfn|Kaplan|2006|p=115}}  ''Maus'' was difficult for critics and reviewers to classify, and also for booksellers, who needed to know on which shelves to place it.  Though Pantheon pushed for the term \"graphic novel\", Spiegelman was not comfortable with this, as many book-length comics were being referred to as \"graphic novels\" whether or not they had novelistic qualities.  He suspected the term's use was an attempt to validate the comics form, rather than to describe the content of the books.{{sfn|Petersen|2010|p=222}}  Spiegelman later came to accept the term, and with [[Drawn and Quarterly]] publisher Chris Oliveros successfully lobbied the [[Book Industry Study Group]] in the early 2000s to include \"graphic novel\" as a category in bookstores.{{sfnm|1a1=McGrath|1y=2004|1p=2|2a1=Morman|2y=2003}}\n\nPantheon collected the last five chapters in 1991 in a second volume subtitled ''And Here My Troubles Began''.  Pantheon later collected the two volumes into soft- and hardcover two-volume boxed sets and single-volume editions.{{sfn|Rhoades|2008|p=220}}  In 1994 the [[Voyager Company]] released ''The Complete Maus'' on [[CD-ROM]], a collection which contained the original comics, Vladek's taped transcripts, filmed interviews, sketches, and other background material.{{sfn|Horowitz|1997|p=403}}  The CD-ROM was based on [[HyperCard]], a [[Macintosh]]-only application that has since become obsolete.{{sfn|Hignite|2007|p=57}}  In 2011 Pantheon Books published a companion to ''The Complete Maus'' entitled ''[[MetaMaus]]'', with further background material, including filmed footage of Vladek.{{sfn|Kois|2011}}  The centerpiece of the book is a Spiegelman interview conducted by [[Hillary Chute]].

Three translations were particularly important to Spiegelman: French, as his wife was French, and because of his respect for the sophisticated [[Franco-Belgian comics]] tradition; German, given the book's background; and [[Polish language|Polish]].

Based on Vladek's memory, Spiegelman portrayed one of the minor characters as a member of the Nazi-installed Jewish Police.  An [[Israelis|Israeli]] descendant objected and threatened to sue for [[Defamation|libel]].  Spiegelman redrew the character with a [[fedora]] in place of his original police hat, but appended a note to the volume voicing his objection to this \"intrusion\".{{sfnm|1a1=Mozzocco|1y=2011|2a1=Spiegelman|2y=2011|2p=154}}  This version of the first volume appeared in 1990 from the publishing house [[Kinneret Zmora-Bitan Dvir|Zmora Bitan]].

It examines the choices Spiegelman made in the retelling of his father's memories, and the artistic choices he had to make\u2014for example, when his French wife [[Conversion to Judaism|converts to Judaism]], Spiegelman's character frets over whether to depict her as a frog, a mouse, or another animal.{{sfnm|1a1=Young|1y=2006|1p=250|2a1=Witek|2y=1989|2pp=112\u2013114}}\n\nThe book portrays humans with the heads and tails of different species of animals; Jews are drawn as mice and other Germans and Poles as cats and pigs,<!-- PLEASE DO NOT ADD TO THIS LIST! -->{{sfn|Fathers|2007|p=122}} among others.  Spiegelman took advantage of the way [[Nazi propaganda films]] depicted Jews as vermin,{{sfn|Pustz|2007|p=69}} though he was first struck by the metaphor after attending a presentation where [[Ken Jacobs]] showed films of [[minstrel show]]s along with early American animated films, abundant with racial caricatures.{{sfn|Loman|2010|pp=221\u2013223}}  Spiegelman derived the mouse as symbol for the Jew from Nazi propaganda, emphasized in a quote from a German newspaper in the 1930s that prefaces the second volume: \"Mickey Mouse is the most miserable idea ever revealed&nbsp;... Healthy emotions tell every independent young man and every honorable youth that the dirty and filth-covered vermin, the greatest bacteria carrier in the animal kingdom, cannot be the ideal type of animal&nbsp;... Away with Jewish brutalization of the people!  Down with Mickey Mouse!  Wear the Swastika Cross!\"{{sfn|Hungerford|2003|p=87}}\n\nJewish characters try to [[Passing (racial identity)|pass themselves off]] as ethnic Poles by tying pig masks to their faces, with the strings showing at the back.{{sfn|Witek|1989|p=106}}  Vladek's disguise was more convincing than Anja's\u2014\"you could see she was more Jewish\", Vladek says.

According to art historian [[Andrea Liss]], this may paradoxically enable the reader to identify with the characters as human, preventing the reader from observing racial characteristics based on facial traits, while reminding readers that racist classification is ever present.{{sfn|Liss|1998|p=53}}\n\nIn making people of each ethnicity look alike, Spiegelman hoped to show the absurdity of dividing people along such lines.  Spiegelman has stated that \"these metaphors&nbsp;... are meant to self-destruct\"{{sfn|Bolhafner|1991|p=96}} and \"reveal the inanity of the notion itself\".{{sfn|Hays|2011}}  Professor [[Amy Hungerford]] saw no consistent system to the animal metaphor.{{sfn|Hungerford|2003|p=86}}  Rather, it signified the characters' roles in the story rather than their races\u2014the [[gentile]] Fran\u00e7oise is a mouse because of her identification with her husband, who identifies with the Holocaust victims.  When asked what animal he would make [[Israeli Jews]], Spiegelman suggests [[porcupine]]s.{{sfn|Hungerford|2003|p=87}}  When Art visits his [[psychiatrist]], the two wear mouse masks.{{sfn|Pustz|2007|p=70}}  Spiegelman's perceptions of the animal metaphor seem to have evolved over the book's making\u2014in the original publication of the first volume, his self-portrait showed a mouse head on a human body, but by the time the second volume arrived, his self-portrait had become that of a man wearing a mouse mask.{{sfn|Hirsch|1997|p=27}}  In ''Maus'', the characters seem to be mice and cats only in their predator/prey relationship. In every respect other than their heads and tails, they act and speak as ordinary humans.{{sfn|Hirsch|1997|p=27}} Further complicating the animal metaphor, Anja is ironically shown to be afraid of mice, while other characters appear with pet dogs and cats, and the Nazis with attack dogs.{{sfn|Wolk|2008|p=283}}\n\n===Memory===\n\nTo [[Marianne Hirsch]], Spiegelman's life is \"dominated by memories that are not his own\".{{sfn|Hirsch|1997|p=26}}  His work is one not of memory but of ''postmemory''\u2014a term she coined after encountering ''Maus''.  This describes the relation of the children of survivors with the survivors themselves.  While these children have not had their parents' experiences, they grow up with their parents' memories\u2014the memory of another's memory\u2014until the stories become so powerful that for these children they become memories in their own right.  The children's proximity creates a \"deep personal connection\" with the memory, though separated from it by \"generational distance\".{{sfnm|1a1=Levine|1y=2006|1p=17|2a1=Berger|2y=1999|2p=231}}\n\nArt tried to keep his father's story chronological, because otherwise he would \"never keep it straight\".{{sfnm|1a1=Merino|1y=2010|2a1=Weine|2y=2006|2p=27|3a1=Brown|3y=1988}}  His mother Anja's memories are conspicuously absent from the narrative, given her suicide and Vladek's destruction of her diaries.  Hirsch sees ''Maus'' in part as an attempt to reconstruct her memory.  Vladek keeps her memory alive with the pictures on his desk, \"like a shrine\", according to Mala.{{sfn|Hirsch|1997|p=33\u201334}}\n\n===Guilt===\n\nSpiegelman displays his sense of guilt in many ways.  He suffers anguish over his dead brother, Richieu, who perished in the Holocaust, and whom he feels he can never live up to.{{sfn|Schwab|2010|p=37}}  The eighth chapter, made after the publication and unexpected success of the first volume, opens with a guilt-ridden Spiegelman (now in human form, with a strapped-on mouse mask) atop a pile of corpses\u2014the corpses of the six million Jews upon whom ''Maus''{{'}} success was built.{{sfn|Kannenberg|2001|p=86}}  He is told by his psychiatrist that his father feels guilt for having survived and for outliving his first son,{{sfn|Schuldiner|2011|p=69}} and that some of Art's guilt may spring from painting his father in such an unflattering way.{{sfn|Schuldiner|2011|p=70}} As he had not lived in the camps himself, he finds it difficult to understand or visualize this \"separate universe\", and feels inadequate in portraying it.{{sfn|Fathers|2007|p=124}}{{sfn|Schuldiner|2011|p=75}}\n\n===Racism===\n\n[[File:Oberkapo - Armbinde.jpg|alt=Kapo armband|right|thumb|[[Kapo (concentration camp)|Kapo]]s, prisoner supervisors under the Nazis, are depicted as antisemitic Poles.]]\n\nSpiegelman parodies the Nazis' vision of racial divisions; Vladek's racism is also put on display when he becomes upset that Fran\u00e7oise would pick up a black hitchhiker, a \"[[List of ethnic slurs#S|schwartser]]\" as he says.  When she berates him, a victim of antisemitism, for his attitude, he replies, \"It's not even to compare, the schwartsers and the Jews!\"{{sfn|Loman|2010|p=224}}  Spiegelman gradually deconstructs the animal metaphor throughout the book, especially in the second volume, showing where the lines cannot be drawn between races of humans.{{sfn|Loman|2010|p=225}}\n\nThe Germans are depicted with little difference between them, but there is great variety among the Poles and Jews who dominate the story.{{sfn|LaCapra|1998|pp=161}}  Sometimes Jews and the Jewish councils are shown complying with the occupiers; some trick other Jews into capture, while others act as police for the Nazis.{{sfn|LaCapra|1998|pp=167\u2013168}}\n\nSpiegelman shows numerous instances of Poles who risked themselves to aid Jews, and also shows antisemitism as being rife among them. The [[kapo (concentration camp)|kapo]]s who run the camps are Poles, and Anja and Vladek are tricked by Polish smugglers into the hands of the Nazis. Anja and Vladek hear stories that Poles continue to drive off and even kill returning Jews after the war.{{sfn|LaCapra|1998|pp=166\u2013167}}\n\n===Language===\n\nVladek's English is broken in contrast with that of Art's more fluent therapist, Paul Pavel, who is also an immigrant and Holocaust survivor.{{sfn|Rosen|2005|p=158}}  Vladek's knowledge of the language helps him several times during the story, as when he uses it to meet Anja. He also uses it to befriend a Frenchman, and continues to correspond with him in English after the war. His recounting of the Holocaust, first to American soldiers, then to his son, is never in his mother tongue,{{sfn|Rosen|2005|p=165}} and English becomes his daily language when he moves to America.{{sfn|Rosen|2005|p=166}}  His difficulty with his second language is revealed as Art writes his dialogue in broken English;{{sfn|Rosen|2005|p=164}} when Vladek is imprisoned he tells Art, \"[E]very day we prayed&nbsp;... I was very religious, and it wasn't else to do\".{{sfn|Wirth-Nesher|2006|p=168}}  Late in the book, Vladek talks of Dachau, saying, \"And here&nbsp;... my troubles began\", though clearly his troubles had begun long before Dachau. This unidiomatic expression was used as the subtitle of the second volume.{{sfn|Rosen|2005|p=164}}\n\nThe German word ''Maus'' is [[cognate]] to the English word \"mouse\",{{sfn|Levine|2006|p=21}} and also reminiscent of the German verb ''mauscheln'', which means \"to speak like a Jew\"{{sfn|Levine|2006|p=22}} and refers to the way Jews from [[Eastern Europe]] spoke German{{sfn|Rothberg|2000|p=208}}\u2014a word not [[Etymology|etymologically]] related to ''Maus'', but distantly to ''[[Moses]]''.{{sfn|Levine|2006|p=22}}\n\n==Style==\n\n[[File:Atomic Mouse issue 6 cover.jpg|thumb|right|upright|alt=Cover of comic book Atomic Mouse|Spiegelman's use of [[funny animal]]s, similar to those shown here, conflicted with readers' expectations.]]\n\nSpiegelman's perceived audacity in using the Holocaust as his subject was compounded by his telling the story in comics.  The prevailing view in the English-speaking world held comics as inherently trivial,{{sfn|Russell|2008|p=221}} thus degrading Spiegelman's subject matter, especially as he used animal heads in place of recognizably human ones.{{sfn|Witek|1989|p=97}}  [[Funny animal]]s have been a staple of comics, and while they have a traditional reputation as children's fare, the underground had long made use of them in adult stories,{{sfn|Witek|1989|p=110}} for example in [[Robert Crumb]]'s [[Fritz the Cat]], which comics critic Joseph Witek asserts shows that the genre could \"open up the way to a paradoxical narrative realism\" that ''Maus'' exploited.{{sfn|Witek|1989|p=111}}\n\nOstensibly about the Holocaust, the story entwines with the frame tale of Art interviewing and interacting with his father.  Art's \"Prisoner on the Hell Planet\" is also encompassed by the frame, and stands in visual and thematical contrast with the rest of the book as the characters are in human form{{sfn|Witek|1989|p=98}} in a [[Surrealism|surreal]], [[German Expressionism|German Expressionist]] [[woodcut]] style inspired by [[Lynd Ward]].{{sfn|Witek|2004|p=100}}\n\nSpiegelman blurs the line between the frame and the world, such as when neurotically trying to deal with what ''Maus'' is becoming for him, he says to his wife, \"In real life you'd never have let me talk this long without interrupting.\"{{sfn|Liss|1998|p=54}}  When a prisoner whom the Nazis believe to be a Jew claims to be German, Spiegelman has difficulty deciding whether to present this character as a cat or a mouse.{{sfn|Kannenberg|2001|p=85}}  Throughout the book, Spiegelman incorporates and highlights banal details from his father's tales, sometimes humorous or ironic, giving a lightness and humanity to the story which \"helps carry the weight of the unbearable historical realities\".{{sfn|Liss|1998|p=55}}\n\nSpiegelman started taking down his interviews with Vladek on paper, but quickly switched to a tape recorder,{{sfn|Rothberg|2000|pp=207\u2013208}} face-to-face or over the phone.{{sfn|Brown|1988}}  Spiegelman often condensed Vladek's words, and occasionally added to the dialogue{{sfn|Rothberg|2000|pp=207\u2013208}} or synthesized multiple retellings into a single portrayal.{{sfn|Brown|1988}}\n\nSpiegelman worried about the effect that his organizing of Vladek's story would have on its authenticity.  In the end, he eschewed a [[Joycean]] approach and settled on a linear narrative he thought would be better at \"getting things across\".{{sfn|Brown|1988}}  He strove to present how the book was recorded and organized as an integral part of the book itself, expressing the \"sense of an interview shaped by a relationship\".{{sfn|Brown|1988}}\n\n===Artwork===\n\nThe story is text-driven, with few wordless [[Panel (comics)|panels]]{{sfn|Kannenberg|1999|pp=100\u2013101}} in its 1,500 black-and-white panels.{{sfn|Weine|2006|pp=25\u201326}}  The art has high contrast, with heavy black areas and thick black borders balanced against areas of white and wide white margins.  There is little gray in the shading.{{sfn|Adams|2008|p=172}}  In the narrative present, the pages are arranged in eight-panel grids; in the narrative past, Spiegelman found himself \"violating the grid constantly\" with his page layouts.{{sfn|Weine|2006|p=26}}\n\nSpiegelman rendered the original three-page \"Maus\" and \"Prisoner on the Hell Planet\" in highly detailed, expressive styles.  Spiegelman planned to draw ''Maus'' in such a manner, but after initial sketches he decided to use a pared-down style, one little removed from his pencil sketches, which he found more direct and immediate.  Characters are rendered in a minimalist way: animal heads with dots for eyes and slashes for eyebrows and mouths, sitting on humanoid bodies.{{sfn|Pekar|1986|p=56}}  Spiegelman wanted to get away from the rendering of the characters in the original \"Maus\", in which oversized cats towered over the Jewish mice, an approach which Spiegelman says, \"tells you how to feel, tells you how to think\".{{sfn|Witek|1989|p=104}}  He preferred to let the reader make independent moral judgments.{{sfn|Witek|1989|p=112}}  He drew the cat-Nazis the same size as the mouse-Jews, and dropped the stereotypical villainous expressions.{{sfn|Witek|1989|p=106}}\n\nSpiegelman wanted the artwork to have a diary feel to it, and so drew the pages on [[stationery]] with a fountain pen and typewriter [[correction fluid]].  It was reproduced at the same size it was drawn, unlike his other work, which was usually drawn larger and shrunk down, which hides defects in the art.{{sfn|Conan|2011}}\n\n===Influences===\n\n[[File:Frans Masereel - Passionate Journey -- two pages.jpg|thumb|alt=Two pages from a woodcut novel by Frans Masereel|Wordless [[woodcut]] novels such as those by [[Frans Masereel]] were an early influence on Spiegelman.]]\n\nSpiegelman has published articles promoting a greater knowledge of his medium's history.

Spiegelman stated, \"without ''Binky Brown'', there would be no ''Maus''\".{{sfn|Chute|2010|p=18}}  Among the graphic artists who influenced ''Maus'', Spiegelman cited [[Frans Masereel]], who had made early [[wordless novel]]s in [[woodcut]]s such as ''[[Passionate Journey]]'' (1919).{{sfn|Kaplan|2008|p=171}}\n\n==Reception and legacy==\n\nSpiegelman's work as cartoonist and editor had long been known and respected in the comics community, but the media attention after the first volume's publication in 1986 was unexpected.{{sfn|Weiner|2003|p=36}}  Hundreds of overwhelmingly positive reviews appeared, and ''Maus'' became the center of new attention focused on comics.{{sfn|Witek|1989|p=94}}  It was considered one of the \"Big Three\" book-form comics from around 1986\u20131987, along with ''[[Watchmen]]'' and ''[[The Dark Knight Returns]]'', that are said to have brought the term \"graphic novel\" and the idea of comics for adults into mainstream consciousness.{{sfnm|1a1=Kaplan|1y=2008|1p=172|2a1=Sabin|2y=1993|2p=246|3a1=Stringer|3y=1996|3p=262|4a1=Ahrens|4a2=Meteling|4y=2010|4p=1|5a1=Williams|5a2=Lyons|5y=2010|5p=7}}  It was credited with changing the public's perception of what comics could be{{sfn|Witek|1989|pp=94\u201395}} at a time when, in the English-speaking world, they were considered to be for children, and strongly associated with superheroes.{{sfn|Witek|2004}}  Initially, critics of ''Maus'' showed a reluctance to include comics in literary discourse.{{sfnm|1a1=Russell|1y=2008|1p=223|2a1=Horowitz|2y=1997|2p=406}}  ''The New York Times'' intended praise when saying of the book, \"Art Spiegelman doesn't draw comic books\".{{sfnm|1a1=Witek|1y=2004|2a1=Langer|2y=1998}}  After its [[Pulitzer Prize]] win, it won greater acceptance and interest among academics.{{sfn|Russell|2008|p=223}}  The [[Museum of Modern Art]] staged an exhibition on the making of ''Maus'' in 1991\u201392.{{sfnm|1a1=Kaplan|1y=2006|1p=118|2a1=Weine|2y=2006|2p=25}}\n\n[[File:Art Spiegelman (2007).jpg|alt=Art Spiegelman|thumb|left|upright|Spiegelman continues to attract academic attention and influence younger cartoonists.]]\n\n''Maus'' proved difficult to classify to a genre,{{sfnm|1a1=Orb\u00e1n|1y=2005|1pp=39\u201340|2a1=Rhoades|2y=2008|2p=219}} and has been called biography, fiction, autobiography, history, and memoir.{{#tag:ref|For \"biography\", see {{harvnb|Brown|1988}}\n<br />For \"fiction\", see {{harvnb|New York Times staff|1987}}; {{harvnb|Ruth|2011}}\n<br />For \"autobiography\", see {{harvnb|Merino|2010}}\n<br />For \"history\", see {{harvnb|Brown|1988}}; {{harvnb|Ruth|2011}}; {{harvnb|Garner|2011}}\n<br />For \"memoir\", see {{harvnb|Ruth|2011}}; {{harvnb|Garner|2011}} }}  Spiegelman petitioned ''The New York Times'' to move it from \"fiction\" to \"non-fiction\" on the newspaper's bestseller list,{{sfn|Liss|1998|p=54}} saying, \"I shudder to think how [[David Duke]]&nbsp;... would respond to seeing a carefully researched work based closely on my father's memories of life in Hitler's Europe and in the death camps classified as fiction\".

Academics far outside the field of comics such as [[Dominick LaCapra]], [[Linda Hutcheon]], and [[Terrence Des Pres]] took part in the discourse.  Few approached ''Maus'' who were familiar with comics, largely because of the lack of an academic comics tradition\u2014''Maus'' tended to be approached as Holocaust history or from a film or literary perspective.  In 2003, Deborah Geis edited a collection of essays on ''Maus'' called ''Considering ''Maus'': Approaches to Art Spiegelman's \"Survivor's Tale\" of the Holocaust''.{{sfn|Frahm|2004}}  ''Maus'' is considered an important work of [[Holocaust literature]], and studies of it have made significant contributions to [[Holocaust studies]].{{sfn|Loman|2010|p=218}}\n\n[[File:Pekar small.jpg|right|thumb|upright|alt=Harvey Pekar|Comics writer and critic [[Harvey Pekar]] objected to ''Maus''{{'}}s use of animals and the negative depiction of Spiegelman's father.]]\n\nAccording to writer Arie Kaplan, some Holocaust survivors objected to Spiegelman making a comic book out of their tragedy.{{sfn|Kaplan|2006|p=119}}  Literary critics such as [[Hillel Halkin]] objected that the animal metaphor was \"doubly dehumanizing\", reinforcing the Nazi belief that the atrocities were perpetrated by one species on another, when they were actually done by humans against humans.{{sfnm|1a1=Hatfield|1y=2005|1pp=139\u2013140|2a1=Russell|2y=2008|2p=221}}  Comics writer and critic [[Harvey Pekar]] and others{{sfn|Park|2011}} saw Spiegelman's use of animals as potentially reinforcing stereotypes.{{sfnm|1a1=Pekar|1y=1986|1p=55|2a1=Pekar|2y=1990|2pp=32\u201333}}  Pekar was also disdainful of Spiegelman's overwhelmingly negative portrayal of his father,{{sfnm|1a1=Pekar|1y=1986|1p=56|2a1=Pekar|2y=1990|2p=32}} calling him disingenuous and hypocritical for such a portrayal in a book that presents itself as objective.{{sfn|Pekar|1986|p=57}}  Comics critic [[R.&nbsp;C. Harvey]] argued that Spiegelman's animal metaphor threatened \"to erode {{interp|''Maus''{{'}}s}} moral underpinnings\",{{sfn|Harvey|1996|p=243}} and played \"directly into {{interp|the Nazis'}} racist vision\".{{sfn|Harvey|1996|p=244}}\n\nCommentators such as Peter Obst and Lawrence Weschler expressed concern over the Poles' depiction as pigs,{{sfnm|1a1=Obst|1y=, \"A Commentary on Maus by Art Spiegelman\"|2a1=Weschler|2y=2001}} which reviewer [[Marek Kohn]] saw as an ethnic slur{{sfn|Baker|1993|pp=142, 160}} and ''The Norton Anthology of American Literature'' called \"a calculated insult\".{{sfn|Baym|Klinkowitz|Krupat|Wallace|2007|p=3091}} Jewish culture views pigs and pork as non-[[Kashrut|kosher]], or ''unclean''\u2014a point of which the Jewish Spiegelman was unlikely to be ignorant.{{sfnm|1a1=Obst|1y=, \"A Commentary on Maus by Art Spiegelman\"|2a1=Weschler|2y=2001}}  Critics such as Obst and Pekar have said that the portrayal of Poles is unbalanced\u2014that, while some Poles are seen as helping Jews, they are often shown doing so for self-serving reasons.{{sfnm|1a1=Pekar|1y=1990|1pp=32\u201333|2a1=Obst|2y=, \"A Commentary on Maus by Art Spiegelman\"}}  In the late 1990s, an objector to ''Maus''{{'}}s depiction of Poles interrupted a presentation by Spiegelman at Montreal's [[McGill University]] with persistent abuse and was expelled from the auditorium.{{sfn|Surridge|2001|p=37}}\n\nLiterary critic Walter Ben Michaels found Spiegelman's racial divisions \"counterfactual\".{{sfn|Loman|2010|pp=223\u2013224}}  Spiegelman depicts Europeans as different animal species based on Nazi conceptions of race, but all Americans, both black and white, as dogs\u2014with the exception of the Jews, who remain unassimilated mice.  To Michaels, ''Maus'' seems to gloss over the racial inequality that has plagued the history of the U.S.{{sfn|Loman|2010|pp=223\u2013224}}\n\nOther critics, such as Bart Beaty, objected to what they saw as the work's fatalism.{{sfn|Beaty|2012}}\n\nScholar Paul Buhle asserted, \"More than a few readers have described {{interp|''Maus''}} as the most compelling of any {{interp|Holocaust}} depiction, perhaps because only the caricatured quality of comic art is equal to the seeming unreality of an experience beyond all reason.\"{{sfn|Chute|2006|pp=200\u2013201}} Michael Rothberg opined, \"By situating a nonfictional story in a highly mediated, unreal, 'comic' space, Spiegelman captures the hyperintensity of Auschwitz.\"{{sfn|Chute|2006|p=201}}\n\n=== Parodies ===\nBelgian publisher La Cinqui\u00e8me Couche{{sfn|Couvreur|2012}} anonymously produced a book called ''Katz'', a remix of Spiegelman's book with all animal heads replaced with cat heads.  The book reproduced every page and line of dialogue from the French translation of ''Maus''.

Anderson was executive producer with [[Tom Gutteridge]]. One of the series' directors was [[John Glen (director)|John Glen]], who had previously directed five ''[[James Bond in film|James Bond]]'' films.\nThere were a number of directors used on the series, but the majority of the episodes were edited by the series editors, Sue Robinson and Jason Krasucki.\n\n==Premise==\nThe series is set in the year 2040 and starred American actor [[Ted Shackelford]] as former [[NYPD]] detective Patrick Brogan, now a lieutenant with the Demeter City police force on the planet Altor in the [[Epsilon Eridani]] system. Brogan and his partner Jack Haldane (played by Rob Youngblood) must adjust to living in another solar system, and investigating crimes being committed by aliens as well as humans. Also co-starring was [[Denmark|Danish]] actress [[Simone Bendix]] as Officer Jane Castle, Haldane's love interest (Brogan was happily married with a wife, daughter and son who made the move to Demeter City with him). All other major characters were played by actors wearing complex make-up that also included elements of puppetry in order to depict the different alien races.\n\n==Characters==\n===Brogan family===\n* [[Ted Shackelford]] as Lieutenant Patrick Brogan\n* [[Nancy Paul (actress)|Nancy Paul]] as Sally Brogan\n* [[Nick Klein (actor)|Nick Klein]] as Matthew 'Matt' Brogan\n* [[Megan Olive]] as Elizabeth 'Liz' Brogan\n\n===Demeter City Police===\n====Humans====\n* [[Rob Youngblood]] as Officer Jack Haldane\t\n* [[Simone Bendix]] as Officer Jane Castle\n* [[Joseph Mydell]] as Officer Lionel Carson\n\n====Aliens ====\n* Richard Ashton as Alien Ambassador\n\n=====Creons===== \n* [[Jerome Willis]] as Captain Rexton Podly\n* [[Lou Hirsch]] as Officer Silas Romek\n* [[Richard James (actor)|Richard James]] as Officer Hubble Orrin<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.maidenhead-advertiser.co.uk/news/film-news/71725/Actor-pens-his-experiences-on-Gerry.html|title=Actor pens his experiences on Gerry Anderson's Space Precinct 20 years on - Maidenhead Advertiser}}</ref>\n* [[Kieron Jecchinis]] as the voice of Officer Hubble Orrin\n* [[Tom Watt (actor)|Tom Watt]] as Officer Beezle (four episodes)\n* [[Gary Martin (actor)|Gary Martin]] as the voice of Officer Beezle (four episodes)\n\n=====Tarns=====\n* [[Mary Woodvine]] as Officer Aurelia Took\n* [[Colette Hiller]] as the voice of Officer Aurelia Took\n* [[David Quilter]] as Sergeant Thorald Fredo\n\n===Others===\n* Gary Martin as the voice of Slomo - Station 88's Robot computer.\n* Rob Thirtle as Zipload - Brogan's main informant.\n\n==Production==\nThe series was one of the highest-budgeted shows Anderson produced, and was relatively popular in Europe. However, in a repeat of the situation that ''[[UFO (TV series)|UFO]]'' encountered 25 years earlier, American broadcasters were uncertain what to make of the series that looked on the surface to be aimed at younger viewers, yet featured adult-oriented storylines and was usually played straight despite the bizarre storylines and make-up. As a result, ''Space Precinct'' was often scheduled in late-night/early morning time slots. The subsequent low ratings led to its cancellation after just one season.\n\n==Pilot==\nThe idea for ''Space Precinct'' predated the series by nearly a decade. In 1987 Anderson produced '''''Space Police''''', a 55-minute [[television pilot|pilot]] film that featured Anderson regular [[Shane Rimmer]] as Brogan. The series failed to sell at that time and the pilot was never broadcast.\n\nThe pilot, which has since circulated on video and online, features many differences. Brogan is a much older character than that played by Shackleford, and is a bachelor. His partner - and the only other apparently human character in the pilot - is Sgt. Cathy Costello, who is revealed to be a [[Gynoid]] capable of shifting between human appearance and a more robotic look for dangerous missions. The aliens featured in the pilot are catlike rather than the more exotic aliens in ''Space Precinct''. The only character other than Brogan to transfer from the pilot to the series is the robot Slo-Mo. The pilot, which is more comedic in nature than the somewhat serious series that followed, combined live action, full-size prosthetics, puppetry, and [[Supermarionation#Supermacromation|Supermacromation]] techniques.\n\n==Episodes==\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"width:100%\"\n|-\n!Episode<br />Number\n!Title\n!Directed by<ref name=\"AuthEpGuide\">{{cite book|last1=Bentley|first1=Chris|title=The Complete Gerry Anderson: The Authorised Episode Guide|edition=4|year=2008|origyear=2001|publisher=Reynolds and Hearn|location=[[Richmond, London|Richmond]], [[London]]|isbn=978-1-905287-74-1}}</ref>\n!Written by<ref name=\"AuthEpGuide\"/>\n!Original air date\n!Production<br />Order<ref name=\"AuthEpGuide\"/>\n{{Episode list\n|EpisodeNumber=1\n|Title=Protect and Survive\n|DirectedBy=[[John Glen (director)|John Glen]]\n|WrittenBy=[[Paul Mayhew-Archer]]\n|OriginalAirDate={{Start date|1994|10|3|df=y}}\n|ProdCode=2\n|ShortSummary=Brogan's informant Slik Ostrasky is murdered by Tylan Gershom, a smuggler of illegal Xyronite immigrants, and the only witness is slimy Melazoid business executive Armand Loyster.

Anderson was executive producer with [[Tom Gutteridge]]. One of the series' directors was [[John Glen (director)|John Glen]], who had previously directed five ''[[James Bond in film|James Bond]]'' films.\nThere were a number of directors used on the series, but the majority of the episodes were edited by the series editors, Sue Robinson and Jason Krasucki.\n\n==Premise==\nThe series is set in the year 2040 and starred American actor [[Ted Shackelford]] as former [[NYPD]] detective Patrick Brogan, now a lieutenant with the Demeter City police force on the planet Altor in the [[Epsilon Eridani]] system. Brogan and his partner Jack Haldane (played by Rob Youngblood) must adjust to living in another solar system, and investigating crimes being committed by aliens as well as humans. Also co-starring was [[Denmark|Danish]] actress [[Simone Bendix]] as Officer Jane Castle, Haldane's love interest (Brogan was happily married with a wife, daughter and son who made the move to Demeter City with him). All other major characters were played by actors wearing complex make-up that also included elements of puppetry in order to depict the different alien races.\n\n==Characters==\n===Brogan family===\n* [[Ted Shackelford]] as Lieutenant Patrick Brogan\n* [[Nancy Paul (actress)|Nancy Paul]] as Sally Brogan\n* [[Nick Klein (actor)|Nick Klein]] as Matthew 'Matt' Brogan\n* [[Megan Olive]] as Elizabeth 'Liz' Brogan\n\n===Demeter City Police===\n====Humans====\n* [[Rob Youngblood]] as Officer Jack Haldane\t\n* [[Simone Bendix]] as Officer Jane Castle\n* [[Joseph Mydell]] as Officer Lionel Carson\n\n====Aliens ====\n.

However, in a repeat of the situation that ''[[UFO (TV series)|UFO]]'' encountered 25 years earlier, American broadcasters were uncertain what to make of the series that looked on the surface to be aimed at younger viewers, yet featured adult-oriented storylines and was usually played straight despite the bizarre storylines and make-up. As a result, ''Space Precinct'' was often scheduled in late-night/early morning time slots. The subsequent low ratings led to its cancellation after just one season.\n\n==Pilot==\nThe idea for ''Space Precinct'' predated the series by nearly a decade. In 1987 Anderson produced '''''Space Police''''', a 55-minute [[television pilot|pilot]] film that featured Anderson regular [[Shane Rimmer]] as Brogan. The series failed to sell at that time and the pilot was never broadcast.\n\nThe pilot, which has since circulated on video and online, features many differences. Brogan is a much older character than that played by Shackleford, and is a bachelor. His partner - and the only other apparently human character in the pilot - is Sgt. Cathy Costello, who is revealed to be a [[Gynoid]] capable of shifting between human appearance and a more robotic look for dangerous missions. The aliens featured in the pilot are catlike rather than the more exotic aliens in ''Space Precinct''. The only character other than Brogan to transfer from the pilot to the series is the robot Slo-Mo. The pilot, which is more comedic in nature than the somewhat serious series that followed, combined live action, full-size prosthetics, puppetry, and [[Supermarionation#Supermacromation|Supermacromation]] techniques.\n\n==Episodes==\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"width:100%\"\n|-\n!Episode<br />Number\n!Title\n!Directed by<ref name=\"AuthEpGuide\">{{cite book|last1=Bentley|first1=Chris|title=The Complete Gerry Anderson: The Authorised Episode Guide|edition=4|year=2008|origyear=2001|publisher=Reynolds and Hearn|location=[[Richmond, London|Richmond]], [[London]]|isbn=978-1-905287-74-1}}</ref>\n!Written by<ref name=\"AuthEpGuide\"/>\n!Original air date\n!Production<br />Order<ref name=\"AuthEpGuide\"/>\n{{Episode list\n|EpisodeNumber=1\n|Title=Protect and Survive\n|DirectedBy=[[John Glen (director)|John Glen]]\n|WrittenBy=[[Paul Mayhew-Archer]]\n|OriginalAirDate={{Start date|1994|10|3|df=y}}\n|ProdCode=2\n|ShortSummary=Brogan's informant Slik Ostrasky is murdered by Tylan Gershom, a smuggler of illegal Xyronite immigrants, and the only witness is slimy Melazoid business executive Armand Loyster.

Some strongly supported the execution, particularly those personally affected by Saddam's actions as leader.

The sides of the square are supporting lines: each touches the curve but does not intersect the interior. The Reuleaux triangle can be rotated whilst always touching each side of the square in a single point; this demonstrates that its width (separation between parallel supporting lines) is constant in all directions.]]\n[[File:How to make mathematical roller curve based on triangle.svg|thumb|250px|Construction diagram for generating a curve of constant width from a triangle. ''y'' is a non-negative padding factor (click on diagram for details).]]\n\nIn [[geometry]], a '''curve of constant width''' is a [[Convex set|convex]] planar [[shape]] whose width (defined as the [[perpendicular]] distance between two distinct parallel lines each having at least one point in common with the shape's boundary but none with the shape's interior) is the same regardless of the orientation of the curve.\n\nMore generally, any [[compact set|compact]] convex planar body D has one pair of parallel [[supporting line]]s in any given direction.  A [[supporting line]] is a line that has at least one point in common with the boundary of D but no points in common with the interior of D.  The width of the body is defined as before.  If the width of D is the same in all directions, the body is said to have ''constant width'' and its boundary is a ''curve of constant width''; the planar body itself is called an ''orbiform''.\n\nThe width of a [[circle]] is constant: its diameter.  On the other hand, the width of a square varies between the length of a side and that of a diagonal, in the ratio <math>1:\\sqrt{2}</math>. Thus the question arises: if a given shape's width is constant in all directions, is it necessarily a circle? The surprising answer is that there are many non-circular shapes of constant width.  A nontrivial example is the [[Reuleaux triangle]].  To construct this, take an [[equilateral triangle]] with vertices ABC and draw the arc BC on the circle centered at A, the arc CA on the circle centered at B, and the arc AB on the circle centered at C.  The resulting figure is of constant width.\n\nThe Reuleaux triangle lacks [[tangent]] [[Smooth function#Smoothness of curves and surfaces|continuity]] at three points, but constant-width curves can also be constructed without such discontinuities<ref>{{harvnb|Cundy|Rollett|1961|p=211}}</ref> (as shown in the second illustration on the right).  Curves of constant width can be generated by joining circular arcs centered on the vertices of a regular or irregular convex polygon with an odd number of sides (triangle, pentagon, heptagon, etc.).<ref>{{harvnb|Cundy|Rollett|1961|p=212}}</ref>\n\n== Properties ==\nCurves of constant width can be rotated between parallel line segments. To see this, simply note that one can rotate parallel line segments (supporting lines) around curves of constant width by definition.\nConsequently, a curve of constant width can be rotated in a [[Square (geometry)|square]].\n\nA basic result on curves of constant width is [[Barbier's theorem]], which asserts that the [[perimeter]] of any curve of constant width is equal to the width ([[diameter]]) multiplied by  \u03c0. A simple example of this would be a circle with width ([[diameter]]) d having a perimeter of \u03c0d.\n\nBy the [[isoperimetric inequality]] and Barbier's theorem, the circle has the maximum area of any curve of given constant width.  The [[Blaschke\u2013Lebesgue theorem]] says that the Reuleaux triangle has the least area of any convex curve of given constant width.\n\nThe exact relation between the length and the area of a smooth regular curve <math>C</math> of constant width is as follows:\n:<math>L_{C}^2=4\\pi A_{C}+8\\pi\\big|\\widetilde{A}_{0.5}\\big|,</math>\nwhere <math>L_{C}, A_{C}, \\widetilde{A}_{0.5}</math> denote the length of <math>C</math>, the area of the region bounded by <math>C</math> and the oriented area of the [[Wigner caustic]] of <math>C</math>, respectively. <ref>{{cite journal | title = The improved isoperimetric inequality and the Wigner caustic of planar ovals | first = Micha\u0142 | last = Zwierzy\u0144ski | journal = J.

The sides of the square are supporting lines: each touches the curve but does not intersect the interior. The Reuleaux triangle can be rotated whilst always touching each side of the square in a single point; this demonstrates that its width (separation between parallel supporting lines) is constant in all directions.]]\n[[File:How to make mathematical roller curve based on triangle.svg|thumb|250px|Construction diagram for generating a curve of constant width from a triangle. ''y'' is a non-negative padding factor (click on diagram for details).]]\n\nIn [[geometry]], a '''curve of constant width''' is a [[Convex set|convex]] planar [[shape]] whose width (defined as the [[perpendicular]] distance between two distinct parallel lines each having at least one point in common with the shape's boundary but none with the shape's interior) is the same regardless of the orientation of the curve.\n\nMore generally, any [[compact set|compact]] convex planar body D has one pair of parallel [[supporting line]]s in any given direction.  A [[supporting line]] is a line that has at least one point in common with the boundary of D but no points in common with the interior of D.  The width of the body is defined as before.  If the width of D is the same in all directions, the body is said to have ''constant width'' and its boundary is a ''curve of constant width''; the planar body itself is called an ''orbiform''.\n\nThe width of a [[circle]] is constant: its diameter.  On the other hand, the width of a square varies between the length of a side and that of a diagonal, in the ratio <math>1:\\sqrt{2}</math>. Thus the question arises: if a given shape's width is constant in all directions, is it necessarily a circle? The surprising answer is that there are many non-circular shapes of constant width.  A nontrivial example is the [[Reuleaux triangle]].  To construct this, take an [[equilateral triangle]] with vertices ABC and draw the arc BC on the circle centered at A, the arc CA on the circle centered at B, and the arc AB on the circle centered at C.  The resulting figure is of constant width.\n\nThe Reuleaux triangle lacks [[tangent]] [[Smooth function#Smoothness of curves and surfaces|continuity]] at three points, but constant-width curves can also be constructed without such discontinuities<ref>{{harvnb|Cundy|Rollett|1961|p=211}}</ref> (as shown in the second illustration on the right).  Curves of constant width can be generated by joining circular arcs centered on the vertices of a regular or irregular convex polygon with an odd number of sides (triangle, pentagon, heptagon, etc.).<ref>{{harvnb|Cundy|Rollett|1961|p=212}}</ref>\n\n== Properties ==\nCurves of constant width can be rotated between parallel line segments. To see this, simply note that one can rotate parallel line segments (supporting lines) around curves of constant width by definition.\nConsequently, a curve of constant width can be rotated in a [[Square (geometry)|square]].\n\nA basic result on curves of constant width is [[Barbier's theorem]], which asserts that the [[perimeter]] of any curve of constant width is equal to the width ([[diameter]]) multiplied by  \u03c0. A simple example of this would be a circle with width ([[diameter]]) d having a perimeter of \u03c0d.\n\nBy the [[isoperimetric inequality]] and Barbier's theorem, the circle has the maximum area of any curve of given constant width.  The [[Blaschke\u2013Lebesgue theorem]] says that the Reuleaux triangle has the least area of any convex curve of given constant width.\n\nThe exact relation between the length and the area of a smooth regular curve <math>C</math> of constant width is as follows:\n:<math>L_{C}^2=4\\pi A_{C}+8\\pi\\big|\\widetilde{A}_{0.5}\\big|,</math>\nwhere <math>L_{C}, A_{C}, \\widetilde{A}_{0.5}</math> denote the length of <math>C</math>, the area of the region bounded by <math>C</math> and the oriented area of the [[Wigner caustic]] of <math>C</math>, respectively. <ref>{{cite journal | title = The improved isoperimetric inequality and the Wigner caustic of planar ovals | first = Micha\u0142 | last = Zwierzy\u0144ski | journal = J.
