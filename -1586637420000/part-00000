In 1910 the Gordon family moved to the Western Downs region from [[Talbot, Victoria|Talbot]], in the Central Goldfields region of [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]. The Gordons took up a \"prickly pear selection\" known as \"The Lagoons\" (later Lesmoir) on the [[Balonne River]], as part of a group settlement. The rapid infestation of the [[prickly pear cactus]], ''Opuntia stricta'', led to abandoned properties and surrendered large pastoral leases in [[Prickly pears in Australia|affected areas of Queensland]]. In response, the [[Queensland Government]] introduced prickly pear selections, where land either infested or partly affected was offered for lease at good terms. Group Settlement Schemes, where three or more parties selected in the same parish, were promoted as part of this process. By the beginning of 1909, {{convert|870,849|acre}} had been taken up as prickly pear selections, the majority being in the [[Dalby, Queensland|Dalby]] Land Agent's district, where the Gordons settled.<ref name=qhr/><ref>Mackenzie, pp. 8, 12-16</ref><ref>{{Cite book| last=Ferguson|first=Hector M | others=[[Tara Shire Council]] | title=A history of Tara and district 1840-1960, with addenda | publication-date=1961 | publisher=W.

From the middle of the nineteenth century, large tall trees from the [[Araucaria]] family such as the [[Araucaria bidwillii|bunya]] and [[Araucaria cunninghamii|hoop pines]], and [[Ficus|fig]] trees were widely planted, or in some instances, retained on properties after clearing. Ferns and palms suitable for indoors or simple ferneries became increasingly popular in the late 1800s. The nationalist sentiment of the [[Federation of Australia|Federation]] era influenced a wider appreciation of Australia's flora and fauna, with native plants and animals appropriated as patriotic symbols in architecture and the decorative arts and crafts. While horticulturalists, botanists and other gardening writers increasingly advocated the use of natives in gardens, most household gardeners preferred to plant out their gardens with plants that reminded them of their largely European origins. For people who were interested, only a small number of nurseries stocked a sufficient range of Australian plants. In the early 1900s Australian flora was more likely to be seen in decorative architectural elements of domestic housing than in gardens.<ref name=qhr/><ref name=history-2>Sim, Jeannie, 2001, \"A Golden Age of Gardening in the Subtropics\"\nin Whitehead, Georgina (ed) Planting the Nation, Australian Garden\nHistory Society, Melbourne, pp.118-119 (pp.115-135)</ref><ref>Timms, Peter,\nAustralia's Quarter Acre: The Story of the Ordinary Suburban Garden,\nMiegunyah, Carlton 2006, pp.172-173</ref><ref>Mirmohamadi, Kylie, 2006,\n\"Cultivating the Australian Gardener: Native plants and Victorian\nState School Gardens in the Federation Era\", in Supski, Sian (ed) ACH:\nInternational Journal of Culture and History in Australia , No.24,\npp.83-88 (pp.81-98).</ref>\n\nThough their collections were not always extensive, one type of place where Australian flora could be found was in Queensland's botanic gardens. A network of experimental botanic gardens all initially named Queen's Park, were established throughout Queensland from the mid-1850s. [[Walter Hill (garden curator)|Walter Hill]], the first Superintendent of [[Brisbane]]'s Botanic Garden (now the [[City Botanic Gardens]]), played a key guiding role, advising regional botanic gardens, lobbying governments for support and corresponding with like-minded institutions including the [[Melbourne Botanic Gardens|Melbourne Botanic Garden]] and the [[Kew Gardens|Royal Botanic Gardens in Kew]], England. Sustained by annual government grants, local residents were trustees of these early gardens and professional gardeners were employed to develop them. While part of the horticultural purpose of these places was to provide public spaces of ornament and beauty for recreation and education, research and experimentation into the utilitarian qualities of plants were also major functions.<ref name=qhr/>\n<ref name=history-3>Sim, \"A Golden Age of Gardening in the Subtropics\", pp.119-121.</ref>\n\nFrom a very early age, Dave Gordon was interested in Australian flora. Nurtured by his father's own interest, by the age of seven he was helping to collect seed and raise native trees in Talbot. At the age of 15, following the death of his father and the enlisting of his brother Jim for military service during [[World War I]] Gordon became largely responsible for running \"The Lagoons\". In between developing the family property for wool production and completing schooling by correspondence, Gordon further developed his interest in native plants through extensive reading, seed collecting and experimental plantings.<ref name=qhr/><ref name=history-4>Mackenzie, pp. 12-16</ref><ref>Crone, Nina, 2002, \"A Patron of Australian plants: David Morrice Gordon\", Australian Garden History, Vol.13, No.6, p.22 (pp.22-25)</ref><ref>Borschmann, Gregg, 1993, \"David Gordon interview\", National Library of Australia, Oral TRC2845/20, transcript, 1.1.6.</ref>\n\nIn late 1926 the Gordons acquired Myall Park, comprising part of the combined blocks of Cobblegun, Lower Cobblegun and Miggabaroo, that in turn were formerly part of the large Murilla consolidated pastoral run. Throughout the 1920s and 1930s, Gordon improved Myall Park and acquired more property to increase wool production capacity. In 1940 a pre-existing house on the property was relocated to a ridge just west of Myall Creek and enlarged. Single men's shearing quarters were also built nearby, which were used as temporary accommodation by the Gordon family before the house was completed.<ref name=qhr/><ref name=history-5>Mackenzie, pp. 18-19, 26-27.</ref>\n\nOn pastoral properties producing wool, the provision of accommodation for seasonal workers during the shearing season was a necessity. Shearers' quarters were built to varying standards all over Queensland from the 1840s. The Shearer's and Sugar Worker's Act 1905 was the first Queensland legislation to prescribe minimum standards for \"proper and sufficient\" seasonal worker's housing. The Workers' Accommodation Act 1915 and subsequent amendments extended these provisions. Requirements for quarters included a location away from other buildings used for pastoral purposes, suitable building materials, provision of a verandah, sleeping rooms for workers of a minimum size and height, and separate kitchen, dining room and cook's quarters.<ref name=qhr/><ref name=history-6>See Queensland Government Gazette (QGG), 1915, 30 December No.268</ref><ref>QGG, 1905, 14 November No.122</ref><ref>QGG, 1921, 17 November No.201.</ref>\n\nTo the south-west of the house, Gordon's long term vision was to establish a large garden of native plants. The site did not suit grazing purposes and featured aspects desirable for growing the type of arid and semi-arid plants favoured by Gordon. Well-drained, the area was largely unaffected by humidity and frost, had access to water, and featured a range of soil types. While beauty and climatic suitability were important considerations, Gordon also consciously chose particular inland plants for conservation purposes, because of their vulnerability in their natural habitat from land clearing and grazing practices.<ref name=qhr/><ref name=history-7>Mackenzie, pp.18-19, pp.26-27</ref><ref>Myall Park Botanic Garden, \"History\", webpage, last updated 18 July 2012, https://myallparkbotanicgarden.com/ viewed 24 July 2012.</ref>\n\nThe prickly pear infestation was successfully controlled across Queensland by 1933 after the introduction of the [[Cactoblastis cactorum|cactoblastis moth]] in the mid-1920s. Wool production increased and prices gradually recovered following the worst years of the [[Great Depression in Australia|Depression]]. Transport links were improved by the extension of the branch of the [[Western railway line, Queensland|Western railway line]] from Dalby to its terminus, the newly surveyed town of Glenmorgan, seven kilometres south-east of Myall Park in 1931. These factors meant by the beginning of the 1940s Gordon could devote more time to establishing his garden. In 1941 the first garden plantings commenced, including needlewood (''[[Hakea leucoptera]]''), scarlet bottlebrush (''[[Callistemon macropunctatus]]'') and silver cassia ([[Senna artemisioides|''Senna artemisiodes'']]) and species of ''[[Acacia]]''s and ''[[Eucalypt]]''s.<ref name=qhr/><ref name=history-8>Mackenzie, pp.27-29.</ref>\n\nGordon's interest brought him into contact and correspondence with fellow native plant (and wildlife) enthusiasts from across Australia, including botanists, horticulturalists and naturalists. By the early 1940s he was providing specimens and corresponding with the [[Queensland Herbarium]]. Another early contact was [[George Althofer]], who with his brother Peter, established Nindethana, one of Australia's earliest commercial nurseries dedicated to native flora at Dripstone, [[New South Wales]]. Gordon ordered many of his first plants and seeds from Nindethana and continued to do so over many years until Myall Park became more self-sufficient in the mid-1960s.<ref name=qhr/><ref name=history-9>Aitken, Richard and Looker, Michael, (eds) The Oxford Companion to\nAustralian Gardens, Oxford University Press, 2002, South Melbourne,\np.18</ref><ref>Mackenzie, p.29, pp.42-43.</ref>\n\nWhile a private garden, the Myall Park Botanic Garden was a serious botanic undertaking from its beginnings. The singular emphasis on collecting and growing native flora was an important step in the evolution of Queensland's botanic gardens. Myall Park was only one of a handful of larger scale gardens with a botanical focus established in the first half of the twentieth century in Queensland. Others were Laurel Park Bank in [[Toowoomba]] (1932), originally a private and later council owned garden with a large collection of exotics; [[Anderson Park, Townsville|Anderson Park]] in [[Townsville]] (1932) a council owned collection of native and exotic tropical flora (mainly trees); and Adele's Grove, Albert Lestang's private experimental botanic garden. Located along Lawn Hill Creek in savannah country {{convert|200|km}} southwest of [[Burketown, Queensland|Burketown]], by 1939 Lestang had planted over 1000 species of exotic and native plants, shrubs and trees. Lestang corresponded with Dave Gordon and sent him [[Grevillea]] and Acacia seeds, before his garden was almost completely destroyed by fire and flooding events in the early 1950s.<ref name=qhr/><ref name=history-10>Information derived from Smith, Laurie, \"The Regional Botanic\nGardens of Queensland\", Biennial BGANZ Congress 2009, presentation PDF viewed 26 June 2012, http://www.bganz.org.au/ </ref><ref>http://www.adelsgrove.com.au/ viewed 26 June 2012</ref><ref>\"Adel's Grove & Dave Gordon\", Friends of Myall Park Botanic Garden Newsletter, Winter 2009, p.2</ref><ref>\"Laurel Bank Park\", viewed 26 June 2012, http://www.toowoombarc.qld.gov.au/</ref><ref>\"Townsville City Council Parks Services\", http://www.soe-townsville.org/.</ref>\n\nThe 1950s were the key decade of development for Myall Park. Gordon was able to invest more time and money in the garden because of a boom in wool value that saw prices triple between 1947 and 1951.<ref name=history-11>Pearson, Michael and Lennon, Jane, Pastoral Australia: Fortunes\nFailures and Hard Yakka, 2010, CSIRO Publishing, Collingwood, p.155.</ref> By this time 26,000 sheep were being shorn annually and Gordon was able to leave much of the responsibility of the property's day-to-day operations with an overseer. A timber residence for the overseer and family (now known as Avochie Cottage) was constructed in the early 1950s, south of the shearer's quarters.<ref name=history-12>Mackenzie, pp.18-19.</ref> One hundred and twenty-eight hectares were fenced to prevent livestock from entering the garden. While much of the fenced area was cleared for growing purposes, with the managed garden taking up about {{convert|90|ha}}, some existing [[brigalow]]-[[Casuarina cristata|belah]] vegetation was retained, providing a bush setting for the garden.<ref name=qhr/><ref name=history-13>{{cite web|url=https://myallparkbotanicgarden.com|title=Myall Park Botanic Garden|accessdate=12 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn 1952, Dave Gordon married Dorothy Gemmell. Born in 1930, Dorothy was raised in [[Glen Aplin, Queensland|Glen Aplin]] in the [[Granite Belt]] region, and was from a family of keen naturalists. Sharing her husband's interest in Australian flora, she strongly supported the development of the garden, assisting in numerous garden-related correspondence, preparing Australian flower displays for regional shows and events and acting as a guide and host to many of Myall Park's visitors. Prior to her marriage Dorothy had studied art, and for a period was an art teacher at [[Fairholme College|Fairholme School]] in Toowoomba. Her immersion in garden-related activities influenced the development of her art, especially the production of botanic watercolours. Her work appeared in [[The Bulletin (Australian periodical)|The Bulletin]], and she was commissioned by government officials to produce art as gifts. Through her involvement in art groups who often visited Myall Park, she drew local attention to the beauty of the garden.<ref name=qhr/><ref name=history-14>Mackenzie, pp.52-55</ref><ref name=\"auto\">https://myallparkbotanicgarden.com/</ref>\n\nIn 1951, Gordon employed English horticulturalist Len Miller, an assisted migrant soldier who worked as a gardener for [[Bristol City Council]], providing accommodation for him and his wife Ivy in a new timber house, (later called Terpersie) at Myall Park. Miller's first project was to plant out and record 1000 plants that Gordon had accumulated. By this time a makeshift nursery was in operation. Miller also assisted Gordon in collecting plant specimens and seeds. Initially done locally, over 1952-53 Miller travelled to New South Wales and Victoria, collecting and exchanging plants with nurseries and other enthusiasts. In 1954, Len and Ivy Miller decided to leave Myall Park. Gordon offered the Millers a contract to travel to [[Western Australia]] to places he had identified for plant collection. Between September 1954 and May 1955, the Millers collected over 700 herbarium specimens, 500 seed species and many cuttings. Collecting both cuttings and seeds meant the garden could grow plants true to their parents and raise seeds that could exhibit diversity. Complementing Gordon's existing specimens and seeds, Len Miller's collection came to comprise a substantial proportion of the Myall Park herbarium.<ref name=qhr/><ref name=history-15>Mackenzie, pp.36-37</ref><ref>Crone, pp.22-23</ref><ref>Borschmann, Gregg, 1993, \"David Gordon interview\", 1.2.7.</ref>\n\nAlfred (Alf) Gray replaced Len Miller, working from 1954 to 1957 at Myall Park. Gordon met Gray in 1951 while visiting nurseries and native plant enthusiasts in Victoria and New South Wales. Gray, a forester, nursery manager, seed collector and propagator, was highly regarded by the time he arrived at Myall Park. As officer-in-charge at the Wail Forest Commission Nursery in Western Victoria (1946\u201354), Gray had pioneered arid land revegetation through [[Provenance#Seed provenance|provenance seed harvesting]] and native plant supply.<ref name=qhr/><ref name=history-16>Aitken, and Looker, (eds), The Oxford Companion to Australian Gardens, p.272.</ref>\n\nGray's work at Myall Park focussed on seed raising, with planting and watering work in the garden the responsibility of Gordon. While Gray was working at Myall Park the infrastructure to support the functions of the garden were improved. Drawing on his prior experience, Gray designed suitable nursery structures. According to Gordon, he built for Gray the types of structures that the [[Victorian Government]] would not supply for him at Wail in Victoria.<ref name=history-17>Borschmann, Gregg, 1993, \"David Gordon interview\", 2.1.6.</ref> The nursery consisted of a single-storey timber building with a potting room and a seed storage room, connected by a covered entry to a timber-framed [[Greenhouse|glasshouse]]/misting room with a concrete slab floor. The timber building was constructed first and the glasshouse was a later addition. A yard to the rear of the buildings housed four large timber hardening bays. The nursery was built by Harry Howe, with the assistance of cabinetmaker Bill Dunmall, who fitted out the vermin proof seed storage room with [[silky oak]] cabinet drawers. Cypress pine milled on the property was used in the construction of the buildings. A catalogue system was used to record seed source and date, supplier and usage. Details of propagations, planting locations and survival rates were all recorded. Around this time a large single room, lined with tall cupboards and work benches was constructed at the Gordon family residence house, to provide an art space for Dorothy and to store herbarium specimens. The house is now located within the Myall Park pastoral property, just outside the Botanic Garden boundary.\n<ref name=history-18>Mackenzie, pp.38-40</ref><ref>Crone, p.23</ref><ref>Martin, Susan, \"Visit to Myall Park, Glenmorgan, Queensland\", Australian Garden History, 2006, Vol.17, No.4, p.19</ref><ref name=\"auto\"/> The herbarium specimens formerly located in the house are now held by the Myall Park Botanic Garden.<ref name=qhr/>\n\nIn 1952 Gordon commissioned the damming of a section of Myall Creek, northeast of the house and garden, to increase water supplies. This was done in 1952 by [[Joh Bjelke-Petersen]] (later [[Premier of Queensland]] 1968-87), who was working at Myall Park as a contractor clearing vegetation. Over time Gordon filled the artificial lake with native waterlilies from the local area and beyond. Like the Gordon house, the lake is now located within the Myall Park pastoral property. While the garden featured plants that usually received little rainfall in their natural habitats, an irrigation system was installed to assist with [[Acclimatization|acclimatisation]] after planting out, and to counter any long-term drought conditions. The water system used a network of water tanks on high stands connecting to galvanised piping and hundreds of above ground sprinklers. During particularly dry and hot periods, up to half of the water in the {{convert|25,000|impgal|adj=on}} main tank would be used in a day.<ref name=qhr/><ref name=history-19>Mackenzie, p.31, p.41</ref><ref name=\"history-25\">Crone, p.24</ref><ref name=\"history-27\">https://myallparkbotanicgarden.com</ref><ref>David Gordon interview, Gregg Borschmann 1993, National Library of Australia, Oral TRC2845/20, Final transcript 3.2.2.</ref>\n\nGray was also sent on collecting trips by Dave Gordon. During one three-month trip, seeds and detailed growing conditions were collected for more than 1000 species. By the time Gray left Myall Park in 1957, he (like his predecessor Len Miller) had made a major and important contribution to the development of the garden and herbarium. Many of the plants that grow in the garden derive from seeds collected by Gray and Miller. Albert Robinson replaced Alf Gray and worked for ten years in the garden, continuing propagation projects and cultivating existing plants. Bob Doney also worked in the Myall Park garden during the 1960s.<ref name=history-20>Mackenzie, p.39</ref><ref>Borschmann, Gregg, 1993, \"David Gordon interview\", 3.2.1.</ref> Gordon's employment of nurserymen for what was, at this time, essentially a private hobby, illustrates his passion and serious investment in the garden.<ref name=qhr/>\n\n[[File:Grevillea 'Robyn Gordon' (8044789934).jpg|thumb|Grevillea 'Robyn Gordon']]\nA range of methods were used at Myall Park to provide successful raising and growing conditions, including the preparation of special growing beds, and experiments with soil structure and composition.<ref name=history-21>Mackenzie, pp.42-43.</ref> The influence of Gordon's father was evident in the layout of the garden, through the practice of planting in clumps rather than lines. The garden was organised into divisions and Gordon methodically planted as much of a genus as was available together in the garden. Beyond aesthetic and environmental benefits, this planting method was also a way of encouraging [[natural hybrid]]isation. The genus Grevillea had been a focus during plant collecting trips and in 1963 a new Grevillea hybrid appeared in the garden. Displaying the low growing characteristics of the [[Grevillea bipinnatifida]], together with the vibrant flame coloured flowers of the [[Grevillea banksii|G. banksii]], and the ability to flower throughout the year and attract birds, the hybrid featured highly desirable attributes for gardeners. Gordon named the hybrid [[Grevillea 'Robyn Gordon'|Grevillea \"Robyn Gordon\"]] after his eldest daughter (who died aged 16 from illness in 1969) and distributed it freely to nurseries in Brisbane and Sydney, without payment. Two other hybrids, named after the Gordon's other daughters, Grevillea \"Sandra Gordon\" (also a popular garden plant) and G.'Merinda Gordon' were also produced at Myall Park.<ref name=qhr/><ref name=history-22>Crone, p.23-24</ref><ref>Mackenzie p.44, pp.49-50</ref><ref>Australian National Botanic Gardens, \"Gordon, David Morrice (1899-2001)\", viewed July 2 2012, http://www.anbg.gov.au/biography/gordon-david.html.</ref>\n\nWith its appealing characteristics and adaptability, Grevillea \"Robyn Gordon\" became a very popular plant in Australian gardens. It was the first plant registered by the [[Australian Cultivar Registration Authority]] in 1973. In 1984 the journal ''[[Australian Horticulture]]'' acknowledged its impact; \"Market-wise it was a winner. The public readily gave it a place in their gardens. Landscapers looked upon it as 'a gift from above' and it was planted by the tens of thousands\".\n<ref name=history-23>Quoted in Crone, p.23</ref><ref>Mackenzie, p.50.</ref> The Grevillea \"Robyn Gordon\" is the floral emblem of the [[Western Downs Region|Western Downs Regional Council]] and in 2006 was chosen as the floral emblem for the \"Year of the Outback\".<ref name=qhr/>\n\nThe garden was well established by the early 1960s, with plantings maturing and self-sown species proliferating where space was available. The \"grandiose scale\" of Gordon's efforts to conserve and grow inland native plants had been acknowledged by the mid-1950s <ref name=history-24>Althofer, George, 1956, The Story of Nindethana ,(booklet, transferred to the web), viewed July 2, 2012, http://www.anbg.gov.au\n/history-horticulture/nindethana/index.html.</ref> and visitors became increasingly common at Myall Park. Among the visitors were influential native plant garden advocates [[Jean Galbraith|Jean \"Correa\" Galbraith]], [[Thistle Yolette Harris|Thistle Harris]] and landscape designer [[Edna Walling]]. In addition to visits from specialist interest groups, naturalists, botanists and scientists from institutions like the Queensland Herbarium, experts from other disciplines also conducted research at Myall Park, including world bee authority Dr [[Charles Duncan Michener|Charles Michener]].<ref name=qhr/><ref name=\"history-25\"/><ref>Mackenzie p.46.</ref>\n\nThe gardening activities at Myall Park in the post-war decades occurred at a time when the use of native plants in Australian gardens, after decades of advocacy by enthusiasts, became more popular. Increased environmental awareness, availability of native plants in nurseries, architectural fashions for bushland settings for houses and garden designs reflective of natural Australian environments all contributed to this popularity. For some gardeners, this meant accommodating a few natives among a predominance of exotics. For the most fervent, only native plants were considered suitable for their gardens. The [[Society for Growing Australian Plants]] (of which David Gordon was a life member) was established in Melbourne in 1957 and rapidly grew to become a national body with state branches. Many other specialized native plant interest groups flourished throughout Australia.<ref name=qhr/>\n\nThe 1970s were a period of inactivity in the Myall Park garden. Dave Gordon was unable to work in the garden following the onset of severe arthritis. The decline in wool prices meant less money could be spent on the garden, and no gardeners were employed during this period. Other than occasional minor maintenance and intermittent irrigation during very dry periods, no planting or nursery work occurred. The inherent climatic resilience of the type of plants in the garden meant that although there were some losses, many survived.<ref name=qhr/>\n<ref name=history-26>Mackenzie, pp.50-51.</ref>\n\nIn the 1980s, Dave Gordon's health improved and he was able once again to spend time in the garden. Nurseryman Reg Carter was employed to operate the nursery and propagate seed cuttings and plants. This renewed activity coincided with the increased recognition of Myall Park as a significant botanic garden in ex-situ conservation of rare and endangered plants. In 1987 Gordon was made a [[Member of the Order of Australia]] \"in recognition of service to horticulture and conservation, particularly in the growing of Australian flora\". A notable visitor during this period was Professor Grenville Lucas, Keeper of the Herbarium of the Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew, accompanied by staff from the Queensland Herbarium, who acknowledged the unique importance of the collection.<ref name=qhr/><ref name=\"history-27\"/><ref>Australian Government,\n\"It's an Honour\" webpage,\nhttp://www.itsanhonour.gov.au/honours/index.cfm</ref><ref>Mackenzie pp.61-62</ref><ref>\nCrone, p.24;</ref>\n\nDorothy Gordon's most important body of work was a collection of 48 botanical watercolours of Australian flora. Following her death in a car accident in 1985, a book of this work, ''Australian Wildflower Paintings'', with botanical notes by Dave Gordon was published in 1988, with the assistance of a Bicentennial grant and Meandarra Arts Council. In 1991 the collection was displayed in the Queensland Pavilion at the [[Osaka]] Garden Expo.<ref name=qhr/>\n\nShortly after the first Myall Park Botanic Garden Open Day in September 1988, Gordon approached friends and family to help determine the future management of the garden. The first meeting of the Myall Park Botanic Garden Committee was held in October, marking a new phase of activity. A \"Friends of Myall Park Botanic Garden\" association was formed in 1991 to assist with funding and to encourage volunteer work both on and offsite. In 1992, the Committee became an incorporated company limited, with a Board of Directors. In 1994, {{convert|132|ha}} was excised from the Myall Park pastoral property and granted to Myall Park Botanic Garden Limited, to hold the land in trust for Garden purposes.\n<ref name=history-28>Mackenzie, pp.62-63, 65, pp.74-77</ref><ref>https://myallparkbotanicgarden.com/</ref> Over five decades the garden evolved from a unique private garden devoted to inland native plants, to an extensive botanic garden with important conservation values.<ref name=qhr/>\n\nThere is no formal accreditation of Australian botanic gardens. The organisation Botanic Gardens Australia and New Zealand Incorporated defines a botanic garden as: \"...gardens open to the public which grow plants for public enjoyment, scientific, horticultural, conservation or educational purposes, and which have local, national or international roles\".<ref name=history-29>Information provided by applicant.</ref> Between 1970 and 2009, twenty-seven botanical gardens were established or commenced throughout Queensland.

Within the grounds of the park the former shearer's quarters and overseer's residence (Avochie Cottage) are used for visitor accommodation.<ref name=qhr/><ref name=\"history-27\"/><ref>Mackenzie, pp.75-77.</ref>\n\nDave Gordon died in 2001 at the age of 102, having made an outstanding contribution to the fields of Australian flora conservation and horticulture. The Myall Park Botanic Garden Limited has been active in preserving Dave Gordon's legacy. Approximately 20 new divisions have been established under their directorship. Onsite caretakers and volunteers from across Queensland play a large role in maintaining the garden, nursery, seedbank and herbarium, and records. Research and other partnerships have been fostered with academic institutions, local government and other community groups. The park has widened its research, education and interpretation activities beyond flora to encompass broader biodiversity values.<ref name=\"history-27\"/> Over 200 species of birds have been sighted at Myall Park, evidence of its importance as a [[wildlife refuge]]. Members of the group [[Birds Queensland]] have been longstanding visitors to the garden for bird watching and recording.<ref name=qhr/>\n\nMyall Park is also a popular venue for artists, photographers, local schools and other interest groups for a range of cultural activities. At the 2009 Open Day, Clocked Out (ensemble-in-residence at [[Queensland Conservatorium Griffith University|Queensland Conservatorium]]) and the [[The Australian Voices|Australian Voices]] choir collaborated on \"Grevilleas of Myall Park\", inspired by the flora of the park. Commissioned artworks are located throughout the garden.<ref name=qhr/>\n\n== Description ==\nMyall Park Botanic Garden is located approximately {{convert|7|km}} north-west of Glenmorgan in the Western Downs region, Queensland. Within its {{convert|132.3|ha}} property boundary is a garden landscape of Australian flora of approximately {{convert|90|ha}}. The site is mostly flat, fenced along its property boundary, and includes a cluster of small timber buildings close to its eastern boundary. The site, formerly part of a large pastoral property is largely surrounded by a rural landscape used for grazing and cropping.<ref name=qhr/>\n\nRetained local brigalow-belah vegetation provides a bush setting for the botanic garden. The garden comprises thousands of ex situ Australian arid, semi-arid and dry tropical plants, mostly indigenous to other parts of Queensland and Australia. While the aesthetic of the garden is reflective of an uncultivated inland bush landscape, there is an underlying formality in the layout. The garden is organised into approximately 72 divisions, defined by timber corner pegs. Within the original divisions laid out by David Gordon, plants are grown according to their species, in some instances on raised gravel beds, and are located adjacent to other divisions within their genus. More recent divisions established in the garden generally feature plants from different genera; this occurs in response to soil and climatic variables within the garden or for a particular educational or scientific focus.<ref name=qhr/>\n\nSoil types within the garden include neutral grey brigalow soil, light loams over clays, red lateritic acid gravel, and a layer of blue/grey clay. Some plantings, including some of the oldest in the eucalypt divisions, may not initially appear their age because of the growing conditions and the particular characteristics of the plants. Plants are often marked with a timber stake with identification tags that include their species and planting date.<ref name=qhr/>\n\nReflective of natural growing conditions, established plants receive minimal maintenance. Ground cover, where it exists, is generally not mown in the majority of the grounds, to foster and shelter any unassisted germination. Within the garden, plant labelling and interpretative signage is intentionally unobtrusive.<ref name=qhr/>\n\nLarge water tanks on tall stands are positioned within the garden. Early galvanised steel irrigation pipes are laid throughout the garden and retain sprinkler heads, although these are not in use. A dam for the garden's water purposes is situated on the north-west boundary of the property.<ref name=qhr/>\n\nA looping gravel drive circulates through the site, entering from the eastern side of the property and broadly follows the edges of the garden, as laid out by David Gordon. A number of dirt walking paths meander through different sections of the garden.<ref name=qhr/>\n\nThe original Grevillea \"Robyn Gordon\" is located in a grevillea division close to the western edge of the garden. Together with the other Gordon hybrids, it is featured on the \"Gordon Grevilleas Walk\". Examples of the parent plants Grevillea bipinnatifida and G. banksii, are planted directly adjacent. Grevillea \"Sandra Gordon\" and G. \"Merinda Gordon\" are planted nearby, although these are not the original plants.<ref name=qhr/>\n\nThe gallery and toilets (1995) and the old sawmill [[shed]] (mostly reconstructed) near the entry of the park are not of cultural heritage significance although they are important components in the current day activities of the garden. A number of artworks (not of cultural heritage significance) are located throughout the garden.<ref name=qhr/>\n\nNear the eastern edge of the garden, south-east of the gallery is the cluster of buildings comprising Terpersie Cottage (former nurseryman's residence), the nursery, the garage, and the single men's shearers' quarters. To the south of this group is Avochie Cottage.<ref name=qhr/>\n\nTerpersie Cottage is a small low-set single-storey timber residence. It has a multi-hipped roof clad with corrugated metal sheets and a weatherboard exterior. A large brick [[chimney]] is on the eastern side and a [[screened porch]] is on the north-eastern corner. The building is highly-intact, with very little alteration evident.<ref name=qhr/>\n\nThe nursery comprises two single-storey timber-framed buildings connected by a covered entry to form an L-shape around a fenced yard. The long wing accommodates the potting room (slab-on-ground), seed storage room -a timber lined room, and a rear laundry and toilet. The potting room is unlined and includes timber benches clad with metal sheet, timber shelving and early gardening paraphernalia. The concrete floor has spoon drains now partially filled with cement. The seed room contains built-in silky-oak cupboards with many drawers containing seeds collected over a long period of time, most labelled with plant names. Some garden related archival records are also housed in the seed room.<ref name=qhr/>\n\nThe other wing of the nursery accommodates the misting house, a timber framed glasshouse with a concrete slab floor. The lower part of the walls is lined internally with fibre cement sheets. Above this on the side walls are clear glass operable louvres and on the end wall is a large timber-framed pivot window surrounded by fixed clear glass. The roof is clad with overlapping sheets of rippled, fixed glass and near the ridge are clear glass operable louvres. The roof is sheltered externally by a shade cloth mounted on a metal framing. This shade cloth is a later addition, replacing the original louvred panels. The room contains raised timber benches/boxes for plants that incorporate plastic irrigation pipes with misting nozzles. The floor retains spoon drains under the plant benches. The nursery yard retains four hardening bays. These are large timber \"boxes\" on legs that have a sheltering frame covered in shade cloth.<ref name=qhr/>\n\nAt the south eastern corner of the nursery yard is a garage. This is a single-storey, slab-on-ground building with a [[gable]] roof clad with corrugated metal sheets. It comprises three bays with a fourth bay accommodated in a lean-to on the eastern side. The exterior is weatherboards and the interior is unlined. The garage contains approximately 70 plastic tubs that temporarily holds the herbarium collection of Myall Park. The collection consists of thousands of pages of pressed plant specimens mounted on paper. Individual specimens, record collecting locations and dates, and botanical information.<ref name=qhr/>\n\nTo the north-east of the garage is the single men's Shearers' Quarters, an L-shaped single-storey low-set timber building with a chamferboard exterior and a gable roof clad with corrugated metal sheets. The long wing accommodates the shearers' bedrooms each with a timber built-in cupboard. The bedrooms are accessed from a long eastern verandah that is enclosed at either end for a bathroom. The short wing accommodates the cook's rooms including a kitchen with a stove recess retaining an early cast-iron stove and early built-in kitchen cupboards. At the junction of the two wings is a dining room with a servery into the kitchen and a large brick fireplace. The chimney breast has an external [[Apron (architecture)|apron]] that holds a [[laundry copper]].<ref name=qhr/>\n\nTo the south of this group is Avochie Cottage, a single-storey low-set timber residence with a [[chamferboard]] exterior and a multi-gabled roof clad with corrugated metal sheets. It accommodates three bedrooms, kitchen, lounge, bathroom, toilet, and a verandah on the southern side. It has two large brick [[chimneys]]; the kitchen chimney retains an early cast iron stove.<ref name=qhr/>\n\n== Heritage listing ==\nMyall Park Botanic Garden was listed on the [[Queensland Heritage Register]] on 9 November 2012 having satisfied the following criteria.<ref name=qhr/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history.'''\n\nMyall Park Botanic Garden is important in demonstrating the evolution of Queensland's private and botanic gardens. Established in 1941 by David Gordon, the garden developed from a unique private garden of native plants to an extensive botanic garden with significant conservation and horticultural values. In its earliest decades of development, the garden's scale and singular emphasis on collecting, growing and experimenting with native plants was unparalleled in Queensland. It is thought to be Queensland's oldest garden wholly devoted to Australian flora.<ref name=qhr/>\n\nAs the place where the hybrid Grevillea \"Robyn Gordon\" first appeared, one of Australia's most popular and widely planted cultivars, the garden is closely associated with the increasing use of native plants in Australian gardens from the 1960s. The first plant registered by the Australian Cultivar Registration Authority in 1973, the parent Grevillea \"Robyn Gordon\" remains in the garden.<ref name=qhr/>\n\nMyall Park Botanic Garden has fulfilled many of the traditional functions associated with botanical gardens since the 1940s; increasing horticultural and scientific knowledge about flora, sharing information, seed and plant stock with like-minded institutions, experts and enthusiasts, providing an attractive and educational venue for public recreation (since 1988); and in some instances, providing plant material to nurseries and the public.<ref name=qhr/>\n\n'''The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage.'''\n\nMyall Park Botanic Garden's important collection of garden plants, seed bank, herbarium specimens and detailed records, includes ex situ examples of Australian arid, semi-arid and dry tropical flora rare or threatened in their natural habitats in Queensland and other Australian states.

The garden's collection of living plants, complemented by the seed bank, herbarium specimens and detailed records, nursery and residence are all important elements shared with other botanic gardens. Contrasting with the more formal design features commonly associated with botanic gardens, it is located within a setting of local vegetation. The layout of the garden is organized into divisional sections without hard edged borders or lawns. Minimal maintenance practices on the plants and garden beds are more reflective of natural growing conditions.<ref name=qhr/>\n\nThe highly intact 1950s purpose-built nursery complex -housing potting and seed storage rooms, glasshouse, hardening bays and early gardening implements, together with the garden's irrigation infrastructure -illustrate the spaces, processes and structures used to establish and maintain the garden. The residence (Terpersie) located adjacent to the nursery demonstrates the provision of accommodation for the garden's nurserymen and their families.<ref name=qhr/>\n\nThe shearer's quarters are a good example of the type of worker's housing provided on pastoral properties following the introduction of workers accommodation legislation in Queensland in the early twentieth century. Highly intact, its principal characteristics include the building's location away from other buildings used for pastoral purposes, provision of a verandah and separate sleeping rooms for workers, kitchen and cook's quarters, and dining and bath rooms.<ref name=qhr/>\n\n'''The place is important because of its aesthetic significance.'''\n\nMyall Park Botanic Garden is important for its aesthetic significance, exhibiting picturesque qualities. It has distinct integrity as a cultivated landscape of only Australian native plants. It is a living place, constantly evolving, supporting a diversity of flora and fauna, and varying with the seasons. As such, it offers a changing mix of evocative and complex experiences that delight all the senses.<ref name=qhr/>\n\nThe importance of the aesthetic experience of Myall Park Botanic Garden has been demonstrated over many years in its popularity as a tourist destination and its inspiration for artists, writers, photographers, and musicians.<ref name=qhr/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating a high degree of creative or technical achievement at a particular period.'''\n\nThe successful creation of the hybrid Grevillea \"Robyn Gordon\", encouraged through a deliberate planting process, was an important technical achievement in the field of Australian floral horticulture in the 1960s. The first plant registered by the Australian Cultivar Registration Authority in 1973, it is now one of Australia's most popular and widely planted native plants. The parent Grevillea \"Robyn Gordon\" remains in the garden.<ref name=qhr/>\n\n'''The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons.'''\n\nMyall Park Botanic Garden has a special and longstanding association with gardening and Australian flora and fauna enthusiasts and experts. The garden's horticultural and conservation values have been recognised and appreciated since the 1950s. The garden has been a site of inspiration, education and research for naturalists, botanists and scientists and a range of specialist interest groups including the Society for Growing Australian Plants, the Australian Garden History Society and Birds Queensland.<ref name=qhr/>\n\nThrough their involvement as custodians, volunteers and supporters, the Myall Park Botanic Garden Limited, the Friends of Myall Park Botanic Garden, and the regional community have strong associations with the garden.<ref name=qhr/>\n\n'''The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history.'''\n\nMyall Park Botanic Garden has a special association with David and Dorothy Gordon.

In 1910 the Gordon family moved to the Western Downs region from [[Talbot, Victoria|Talbot]], in the Central Goldfields region of [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]. The Gordons took up a \"prickly pear selection\" known as \"The Lagoons\" (later Lesmoir) on the [[Balonne River]], as part of a group settlement. The rapid infestation of the [[prickly pear cactus]], ''Opuntia stricta'', led to abandoned properties and surrendered large pastoral leases in [[Prickly pears in Australia|affected areas of Queensland]]. In response, the [[Queensland Government]] introduced prickly pear selections, where land either infested or partly affected was offered for lease at good terms. Group Settlement Schemes, where three or more parties selected in the same parish, were promoted as part of this process. By the beginning of 1909, {{convert|870,849|acre}} had been taken up as prickly pear selections, the majority being in the [[Dalby, Queensland|Dalby]] Land Agent's district, where the Gordons settled.<ref name=qhr/><ref>Mackenzie, pp. 8, 12-16</ref><ref>{{Cite book| last=Ferguson|first=Hector M | publisher=[[Tara Shire Council]] | title=A history of Tara and district 1840-1960, with addenda | publication-date=1961 | publisher=W.

From the middle of the nineteenth century, large tall trees from the [[Araucaria]] family such as the [[Araucaria bidwillii|bunya]] and [[Araucaria cunninghamii|hoop pines]], and [[Ficus|fig]] trees were widely planted, or in some instances, retained on properties after clearing. Ferns and palms suitable for indoors or simple ferneries became increasingly popular in the late 1800s. The nationalist sentiment of the [[Federation of Australia|Federation]] era influenced a wider appreciation of Australia's flora and fauna, with native plants and animals appropriated as patriotic symbols in architecture and the decorative arts and crafts. While horticulturalists, botanists and other gardening writers increasingly advocated the use of natives in gardens, most household gardeners preferred to plant out their gardens with plants that reminded them of their largely European origins. For people who were interested, only a small number of nurseries stocked a sufficient range of Australian plants. In the early 1900s Australian flora was more likely to be seen in decorative architectural elements of domestic housing than in gardens.<ref name=qhr/><ref name=history-2>Sim, Jeannie, 2001, \"A Golden Age of Gardening in the Subtropics\"\nin Whitehead, Georgina (ed) Planting the Nation, Australian Garden\nHistory Society, Melbourne, pp.118-119 (pp.115-135)</ref><ref>Timms, Peter,\nAustralia's Quarter Acre: The Story of the Ordinary Suburban Garden,\nMiegunyah, Carlton 2006, pp.172-173</ref><ref>Mirmohamadi, Kylie, 2006,\n\"Cultivating the Australian Gardener: Native plants and Victorian\nState School Gardens in the Federation Era\", in Supski, Sian (ed) ACH:\nInternational Journal of Culture and History in Australia , No.24,\npp.83-88 (pp.81-98).</ref>\n\nThough their collections were not always extensive, one type of place where Australian flora could be found was in Queensland's botanic gardens. A network of experimental botanic gardens all initially named Queen's Park, were established throughout Queensland from the mid-1850s. [[Walter Hill (garden curator)|Walter Hill]], the first Superintendent of [[Brisbane]]'s Botanic Garden (now the [[City Botanic Gardens]]), played a key guiding role, advising regional botanic gardens, lobbying governments for support and corresponding with like-minded institutions including the [[Melbourne Botanic Gardens|Melbourne Botanic Garden]] and the [[Kew Gardens|Royal Botanic Gardens in Kew]], England. Sustained by annual government grants, local residents were trustees of these early gardens and professional gardeners were employed to develop them. While part of the horticultural purpose of these places was to provide public spaces of ornament and beauty for recreation and education, research and experimentation into the utilitarian qualities of plants were also major functions.<ref name=qhr/>\n<ref name=history-3>Sim, \"A Golden Age of Gardening in the Subtropics\", pp.119-121.</ref>\n\nFrom a very early age, Dave Gordon was interested in Australian flora. Nurtured by his father's own interest, by the age of seven he was helping to collect seed and raise native trees in Talbot. At the age of 15, following the death of his father and the enlisting of his brother Jim for military service during [[World War I]] Gordon became largely responsible for running \"The Lagoons\". In between developing the family property for wool production and completing schooling by correspondence, Gordon further developed his interest in native plants through extensive reading, seed collecting and experimental plantings.<ref name=qhr/><ref name=history-4>Mackenzie, pp. 12-16</ref><ref>Crone, Nina, 2002, \"A Patron of Australian plants: David Morrice Gordon\", Australian Garden History, Vol.13, No.6, p.22 (pp.22-25)</ref><ref>Borschmann, Gregg, 1993, \"David Gordon interview\", National Library of Australia, Oral TRC2845/20, transcript, 1.1.6.</ref>\n\nIn late 1926 the Gordons acquired Myall Park, comprising part of the combined blocks of Cobblegun, Lower Cobblegun and Miggabaroo, that in turn were formerly part of the large Murilla consolidated pastoral run. Throughout the 1920s and 1930s, Gordon improved Myall Park and acquired more property to increase wool production capacity. In 1940 a pre-existing house on the property was relocated to a ridge just west of Myall Creek and enlarged. Single men's shearing quarters were also built nearby, which were used as temporary accommodation by the Gordon family before the house was completed.<ref name=qhr/><ref name=history-5>Mackenzie, pp. 18-19, 26-27.</ref>\n\nOn pastoral properties producing wool, the provision of accommodation for seasonal workers during the shearing season was a necessity. Shearers' quarters were built to varying standards all over Queensland from the 1840s. The Shearer's and Sugar Worker's Act 1905 was the first Queensland legislation to prescribe minimum standards for \"proper and sufficient\" seasonal worker's housing. The Workers' Accommodation Act 1915 and subsequent amendments extended these provisions. Requirements for quarters included a location away from other buildings used for pastoral purposes, suitable building materials, provision of a verandah, sleeping rooms for workers of a minimum size and height, and separate kitchen, dining room and cook's quarters.<ref name=qhr/><ref name=history-6>See Queensland Government Gazette (QGG), 1915, 30 December No.268</ref><ref>QGG, 1905, 14 November No.122</ref><ref>QGG, 1921, 17 November No.201.</ref>\n\nTo the south-west of the house, Gordon's long term vision was to establish a large garden of native plants. The site did not suit grazing purposes and featured aspects desirable for growing the type of arid and semi-arid plants favoured by Gordon. Well-drained, the area was largely unaffected by humidity and frost, had access to water, and featured a range of soil types. While beauty and climatic suitability were important considerations, Gordon also consciously chose particular inland plants for conservation purposes, because of their vulnerability in their natural habitat from land clearing and grazing practices.<ref name=qhr/><ref name=history-7>Mackenzie, pp.18-19, pp.26-27</ref><ref>Myall Park Botanic Garden, \"History\", webpage, last updated 18 July 2012, https://myallparkbotanicgarden.com/ viewed 24 July 2012.</ref>\n\nThe prickly pear infestation was successfully controlled across Queensland by 1933 after the introduction of the [[Cactoblastis cactorum|cactoblastis moth]] in the mid-1920s. Wool production increased and prices gradually recovered following the worst years of the [[Great Depression in Australia|Depression]]. Transport links were improved by the extension of the branch of the [[Western railway line, Queensland|Western railway line]] from Dalby to its terminus, the newly surveyed town of Glenmorgan, seven kilometres south-east of Myall Park in 1931. These factors meant by the beginning of the 1940s Gordon could devote more time to establishing his garden. In 1941 the first garden plantings commenced, including needlewood (''[[Hakea leucoptera]]''), scarlet bottlebrush (''[[Callistemon macropunctatus]]'') and silver cassia ([[Senna artemisioides|''Senna artemisiodes'']]) and species of ''[[Acacia]]''s and ''[[Eucalypt]]''s.<ref name=qhr/><ref name=history-8>Mackenzie, pp.27-29.</ref>\n\nGordon's interest brought him into contact and correspondence with fellow native plant (and wildlife) enthusiasts from across Australia, including botanists, horticulturalists and naturalists. By the early 1940s he was providing specimens and corresponding with the [[Queensland Herbarium]]. Another early contact was [[George Althofer]], who with his brother Peter, established Nindethana, one of Australia's earliest commercial nurseries dedicated to native flora at Dripstone, [[New South Wales]]. Gordon ordered many of his first plants and seeds from Nindethana and continued to do so over many years until Myall Park became more self-sufficient in the mid-1960s.<ref name=qhr/><ref name=history-9>Aitken, Richard and Looker, Michael, (eds) The Oxford Companion to\nAustralian Gardens, Oxford University Press, 2002, South Melbourne,\np.18</ref><ref>Mackenzie, p.29, pp.42-43.</ref>\n\nWhile a private garden, the Myall Park Botanic Garden was a serious botanic undertaking from its beginnings. The singular emphasis on collecting and growing native flora was an important step in the evolution of Queensland's botanic gardens. Myall Park was only one of a handful of larger scale gardens with a botanical focus established in the first half of the twentieth century in Queensland. Others were Laurel Park Bank in [[Toowoomba]] (1932), originally a private and later council owned garden with a large collection of exotics; [[Anderson Park, Townsville|Anderson Park]] in [[Townsville]] (1932) a council owned collection of native and exotic tropical flora (mainly trees); and Adele's Grove, Albert Lestang's private experimental botanic garden. Located along Lawn Hill Creek in savannah country {{convert|200|km}} southwest of [[Burketown, Queensland|Burketown]], by 1939 Lestang had planted over 1000 species of exotic and native plants, shrubs and trees. Lestang corresponded with Dave Gordon and sent him [[Grevillea]] and Acacia seeds, before his garden was almost completely destroyed by fire and flooding events in the early 1950s.<ref name=qhr/><ref name=history-10>Information derived from Smith, Laurie, \"The Regional Botanic\nGardens of Queensland\", Biennial BGANZ Congress 2009, presentation PDF viewed 26 June 2012, http://www.bganz.org.au/ </ref><ref>http://www.adelsgrove.com.au/ viewed 26 June 2012</ref><ref>\"Adel's Grove & Dave Gordon\", Friends of Myall Park Botanic Garden Newsletter, Winter 2009, p.2</ref><ref>\"Laurel Bank Park\", viewed 26 June 2012, http://www.toowoombarc.qld.gov.au/</ref><ref>\"Townsville City Council Parks Services\", http://www.soe-townsville.org/.</ref>\n\nThe 1950s were the key decade of development for Myall Park. Gordon was able to invest more time and money in the garden because of a boom in wool value that saw prices triple between 1947 and 1951.<ref name=history-11>Pearson, Michael and Lennon, Jane, Pastoral Australia: Fortunes\nFailures and Hard Yakka, 2010, CSIRO Publishing, Collingwood, p.155.</ref> By this time 26,000 sheep were being shorn annually and Gordon was able to leave much of the responsibility of the property's day-to-day operations with an overseer. A timber residence for the overseer and family (now known as Avochie Cottage) was constructed in the early 1950s, south of the shearer's quarters.<ref name=history-12>Mackenzie, pp.18-19.</ref> One hundred and twenty-eight hectares were fenced to prevent livestock from entering the garden. While much of the fenced area was cleared for growing purposes, with the managed garden taking up about {{convert|90|ha}}, some existing [[brigalow]]-[[Casuarina cristata|belah]] vegetation was retained, providing a bush setting for the garden.<ref name=qhr/><ref name=history-13>{{cite web|url=https://myallparkbotanicgarden.com|title=Myall Park Botanic Garden|accessdate=12 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn 1952, Dave Gordon married Dorothy Gemmell. Born in 1930, Dorothy was raised in [[Glen Aplin, Queensland|Glen Aplin]] in the [[Granite Belt]] region, and was from a family of keen naturalists. Sharing her husband's interest in Australian flora, she strongly supported the development of the garden, assisting in numerous garden-related correspondence, preparing Australian flower displays for regional shows and events and acting as a guide and host to many of Myall Park's visitors. Prior to her marriage Dorothy had studied art, and for a period was an art teacher at [[Fairholme College|Fairholme School]] in Toowoomba. Her immersion in garden-related activities influenced the development of her art, especially the production of botanic watercolours. Her work appeared in [[The Bulletin (Australian periodical)|The Bulletin]], and she was commissioned by government officials to produce art as gifts. Through her involvement in art groups who often visited Myall Park, she drew local attention to the beauty of the garden.<ref name=qhr/><ref name=history-14>Mackenzie, pp.52-55</ref><ref name=\"auto\">https://myallparkbotanicgarden.com/</ref>\n\nIn 1951, Gordon employed English horticulturalist Len Miller, an assisted migrant soldier who worked as a gardener for [[Bristol City Council]], providing accommodation for him and his wife Ivy in a new timber house, (later called Terpersie) at Myall Park. Miller's first project was to plant out and record 1000 plants that Gordon had accumulated. By this time a makeshift nursery was in operation. Miller also assisted Gordon in collecting plant specimens and seeds. Initially done locally, over 1952-53 Miller travelled to New South Wales and Victoria, collecting and exchanging plants with nurseries and other enthusiasts. In 1954, Len and Ivy Miller decided to leave Myall Park. Gordon offered the Millers a contract to travel to [[Western Australia]] to places he had identified for plant collection. Between September 1954 and May 1955, the Millers collected over 700 herbarium specimens, 500 seed species and many cuttings. Collecting both cuttings and seeds meant the garden could grow plants true to their parents and raise seeds that could exhibit diversity. Complementing Gordon's existing specimens and seeds, Len Miller's collection came to comprise a substantial proportion of the Myall Park herbarium.<ref name=qhr/><ref name=history-15>Mackenzie, pp.36-37</ref><ref>Crone, pp.22-23</ref><ref>Borschmann, Gregg, 1993, \"David Gordon interview\", 1.2.7.</ref>\n\nAlfred (Alf) Gray replaced Len Miller, working from 1954 to 1957 at Myall Park. Gordon met Gray in 1951 while visiting nurseries and native plant enthusiasts in Victoria and New South Wales. Gray, a forester, nursery manager, seed collector and propagator, was highly regarded by the time he arrived at Myall Park. As officer-in-charge at the Wail Forest Commission Nursery in Western Victoria (1946\u201354), Gray had pioneered arid land revegetation through [[Provenance#Seed provenance|provenance seed harvesting]] and native plant supply.<ref name=qhr/><ref name=history-16>Aitken, and Looker, (eds), The Oxford Companion to Australian Gardens, p.272.</ref>\n\nGray's work at Myall Park focussed on seed raising, with planting and watering work in the garden the responsibility of Gordon. While Gray was working at Myall Park the infrastructure to support the functions of the garden were improved. Drawing on his prior experience, Gray designed suitable nursery structures. According to Gordon, he built for Gray the types of structures that the [[Victorian Government]] would not supply for him at Wail in Victoria.<ref name=history-17>Borschmann, Gregg, 1993, \"David Gordon interview\", 2.1.6.</ref> The nursery consisted of a single-storey timber building with a potting room and a seed storage room, connected by a covered entry to a timber-framed [[Greenhouse|glasshouse]]/misting room with a concrete slab floor. The timber building was constructed first and the glasshouse was a later addition. A yard to the rear of the buildings housed four large timber hardening bays. The nursery was built by Harry Howe, with the assistance of cabinetmaker Bill Dunmall, who fitted out the vermin proof seed storage room with [[silky oak]] cabinet drawers. Cypress pine milled on the property was used in the construction of the buildings. A catalogue system was used to record seed source and date, supplier and usage. Details of propagations, planting locations and survival rates were all recorded. Around this time a large single room, lined with tall cupboards and work benches was constructed at the Gordon family residence house, to provide an art space for Dorothy and to store herbarium specimens. The house is now located within the Myall Park pastoral property, just outside the Botanic Garden boundary.\n<ref name=history-18>Mackenzie, pp.38-40</ref><ref>Crone, p.23</ref><ref>Martin, Susan, \"Visit to Myall Park, Glenmorgan, Queensland\", Australian Garden History, 2006, Vol.17, No.4, p.19</ref><ref name=\"auto\"/> The herbarium specimens formerly located in the house are now held by the Myall Park Botanic Garden.<ref name=qhr/>\n\nIn 1952 Gordon commissioned the damming of a section of Myall Creek, northeast of the house and garden, to increase water supplies. This was done in 1952 by [[Joh Bjelke-Petersen]] (later [[Premier of Queensland]] 1968-87), who was working at Myall Park as a contractor clearing vegetation. Over time Gordon filled the artificial lake with native waterlilies from the local area and beyond. Like the Gordon house, the lake is now located within the Myall Park pastoral property. While the garden featured plants that usually received little rainfall in their natural habitats, an irrigation system was installed to assist with [[Acclimatization|acclimatisation]] after planting out, and to counter any long-term drought conditions. The water system used a network of water tanks on high stands connecting to galvanised piping and hundreds of above ground sprinklers. During particularly dry and hot periods, up to half of the water in the {{convert|25,000|impgal|adj=on}} main tank would be used in a day.<ref name=qhr/><ref name=history-19>Mackenzie, p.31, p.41</ref><ref name=\"history-25\">Crone, p.24</ref><ref name=\"history-27\">https://myallparkbotanicgarden.com</ref><ref>David Gordon interview, Gregg Borschmann 1993, National Library of Australia, Oral TRC2845/20, Final transcript 3.2.2.</ref>\n\nGray was also sent on collecting trips by Dave Gordon. During one three-month trip, seeds and detailed growing conditions were collected for more than 1000 species. By the time Gray left Myall Park in 1957, he (like his predecessor Len Miller) had made a major and important contribution to the development of the garden and herbarium. Many of the plants that grow in the garden derive from seeds collected by Gray and Miller. Albert Robinson replaced Alf Gray and worked for ten years in the garden, continuing propagation projects and cultivating existing plants. Bob Doney also worked in the Myall Park garden during the 1960s.<ref name=history-20>Mackenzie, p.39</ref><ref>Borschmann, Gregg, 1993, \"David Gordon interview\", 3.2.1.</ref> Gordon's employment of nurserymen for what was, at this time, essentially a private hobby, illustrates his passion and serious investment in the garden.<ref name=qhr/>\n\n[[File:Grevillea 'Robyn Gordon' (8044789934).jpg|thumb|Grevillea 'Robyn Gordon']]\nA range of methods were used at Myall Park to provide successful raising and growing conditions, including the preparation of special growing beds, and experiments with soil structure and composition.<ref name=history-21>Mackenzie, pp.42-43.</ref> The influence of Gordon's father was evident in the layout of the garden, through the practice of planting in clumps rather than lines. The garden was organised into divisions and Gordon methodically planted as much of a genus as was available together in the garden. Beyond aesthetic and environmental benefits, this planting method was also a way of encouraging [[natural hybrid]]isation. The genus Grevillea had been a focus during plant collecting trips and in 1963 a new Grevillea hybrid appeared in the garden. Displaying the low growing characteristics of the [[Grevillea bipinnatifida]], together with the vibrant flame coloured flowers of the [[Grevillea banksii|G. banksii]], and the ability to flower throughout the year and attract birds, the hybrid featured highly desirable attributes for gardeners. Gordon named the hybrid [[Grevillea 'Robyn Gordon'|Grevillea \"Robyn Gordon\"]] after his eldest daughter (who died aged 16 from illness in 1969) and distributed it freely to nurseries in Brisbane and Sydney, without payment. Two other hybrids, named after the Gordon's other daughters, Grevillea \"Sandra Gordon\" (also a popular garden plant) and G.'Merinda Gordon' were also produced at Myall Park.<ref name=qhr/><ref name=history-22>Crone, p.23-24</ref><ref>Mackenzie p.44, pp.49-50</ref><ref>Australian National Botanic Gardens, \"Gordon, David Morrice (1899-2001)\", viewed July 2 2012, http://www.anbg.gov.au/biography/gordon-david.html.</ref>\n\nWith its appealing characteristics and adaptability, Grevillea \"Robyn Gordon\" became a very popular plant in Australian gardens. It was the first plant registered by the [[Australian Cultivar Registration Authority]] in 1973. In 1984 the journal ''[[Australian Horticulture]]'' acknowledged its impact; \"Market-wise it was a winner. The public readily gave it a place in their gardens. Landscapers looked upon it as 'a gift from above' and it was planted by the tens of thousands\".\n<ref name=history-23>Quoted in Crone, p.23</ref><ref>Mackenzie, p.50.</ref> The Grevillea \"Robyn Gordon\" is the floral emblem of the [[Western Downs Region|Western Downs Regional Council]] and in 2006 was chosen as the floral emblem for the \"Year of the Outback\".<ref name=qhr/>\n\nThe garden was well established by the early 1960s, with plantings maturing and self-sown species proliferating where space was available. The \"grandiose scale\" of Gordon's efforts to conserve and grow inland native plants had been acknowledged by the mid-1950s <ref name=history-24>Althofer, George, 1956, The Story of Nindethana ,(booklet, transferred to the web), viewed July 2, 2012, http://www.anbg.gov.au\n/history-horticulture/nindethana/index.html.</ref> and visitors became increasingly common at Myall Park. Among the visitors were influential native plant garden advocates [[Jean Galbraith|Jean \"Correa\" Galbraith]], [[Thistle Yolette Harris|Thistle Harris]] and landscape designer [[Edna Walling]]. In addition to visits from specialist interest groups, naturalists, botanists and scientists from institutions like the Queensland Herbarium, experts from other disciplines also conducted research at Myall Park, including world bee authority Dr [[Charles Duncan Michener|Charles Michener]].<ref name=qhr/><ref name=\"history-25\"/><ref>Mackenzie p.46.</ref>\n\nThe gardening activities at Myall Park in the post-war decades occurred at a time when the use of native plants in Australian gardens, after decades of advocacy by enthusiasts, became more popular. Increased environmental awareness, availability of native plants in nurseries, architectural fashions for bushland settings for houses and garden designs reflective of natural Australian environments all contributed to this popularity. For some gardeners, this meant accommodating a few natives among a predominance of exotics. For the most fervent, only native plants were considered suitable for their gardens. The [[Society for Growing Australian Plants]] (of which David Gordon was a life member) was established in Melbourne in 1957 and rapidly grew to become a national body with state branches. Many other specialized native plant interest groups flourished throughout Australia.<ref name=qhr/>\n\nThe 1970s were a period of inactivity in the Myall Park garden. Dave Gordon was unable to work in the garden following the onset of severe arthritis. The decline in wool prices meant less money could be spent on the garden, and no gardeners were employed during this period. Other than occasional minor maintenance and intermittent irrigation during very dry periods, no planting or nursery work occurred. The inherent climatic resilience of the type of plants in the garden meant that although there were some losses, many survived.<ref name=qhr/>\n<ref name=history-26>Mackenzie, pp.50-51.</ref>\n\nIn the 1980s, Dave Gordon's health improved and he was able once again to spend time in the garden. Nurseryman Reg Carter was employed to operate the nursery and propagate seed cuttings and plants. This renewed activity coincided with the increased recognition of Myall Park as a significant botanic garden in ex-situ conservation of rare and endangered plants. In 1987 Gordon was made a [[Member of the Order of Australia]] \"in recognition of service to horticulture and conservation, particularly in the growing of Australian flora\". A notable visitor during this period was Professor Grenville Lucas, Keeper of the Herbarium of the Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew, accompanied by staff from the Queensland Herbarium, who acknowledged the unique importance of the collection.<ref name=qhr/><ref name=\"history-27\"/><ref>Australian Government,\n\"It's an Honour\" webpage,\nhttp://www.itsanhonour.gov.au/honours/index.cfm</ref><ref>Mackenzie pp.61-62</ref><ref>\nCrone, p.24;</ref>\n\nDorothy Gordon's most important body of work was a collection of 48 botanical watercolours of Australian flora. Following her death in a car accident in 1985, a book of this work, ''Australian Wildflower Paintings'', with botanical notes by Dave Gordon was published in 1988, with the assistance of a Bicentennial grant and Meandarra Arts Council. In 1991 the collection was displayed in the Queensland Pavilion at the [[Osaka]] Garden Expo.<ref name=qhr/>\n\nShortly after the first Myall Park Botanic Garden Open Day in September 1988, Gordon approached friends and family to help determine the future management of the garden. The first meeting of the Myall Park Botanic Garden Committee was held in October, marking a new phase of activity. A \"Friends of Myall Park Botanic Garden\" association was formed in 1991 to assist with funding and to encourage volunteer work both on and offsite. In 1992, the Committee became an incorporated company limited, with a Board of Directors. In 1994, {{convert|132|ha}} was excised from the Myall Park pastoral property and granted to Myall Park Botanic Garden Limited, to hold the land in trust for Garden purposes.\n<ref name=history-28>Mackenzie, pp.62-63, 65, pp.74-77</ref><ref>https://myallparkbotanicgarden.com/</ref> Over five decades the garden evolved from a unique private garden devoted to inland native plants, to an extensive botanic garden with important conservation values.<ref name=qhr/>\n\nThere is no formal accreditation of Australian botanic gardens. The organisation Botanic Gardens Australia and New Zealand Incorporated defines a botanic garden as: \"...gardens open to the public which grow plants for public enjoyment, scientific, horticultural, conservation or educational purposes, and which have local, national or international roles\".<ref name=history-29>Information provided by applicant.</ref> Between 1970 and 2009, twenty-seven botanical gardens were established or commenced throughout Queensland.

Within the grounds of the park the former shearer's quarters and overseer's residence (Avochie Cottage) are used for visitor accommodation.<ref name=qhr/><ref name=\"history-27\"/><ref>Mackenzie, pp.75-77.</ref>\n\nDave Gordon died in 2001 at the age of 102, having made an outstanding contribution to the fields of Australian flora conservation and horticulture. The Myall Park Botanic Garden Limited has been active in preserving Dave Gordon's legacy. Approximately 20 new divisions have been established under their directorship. Onsite caretakers and volunteers from across Queensland play a large role in maintaining the garden, nursery, seedbank and herbarium, and records. Research and other partnerships have been fostered with academic institutions, local government and other community groups. The park has widened its research, education and interpretation activities beyond flora to encompass broader biodiversity values.<ref name=\"history-27\"/> Over 200 species of birds have been sighted at Myall Park, evidence of its importance as a [[wildlife refuge]]. Members of the group [[Birds Queensland]] have been longstanding visitors to the garden for bird watching and recording.<ref name=qhr/>\n\nMyall Park is also a popular venue for artists, photographers, local schools and other interest groups for a range of cultural activities. At the 2009 Open Day, Clocked Out (ensemble-in-residence at [[Queensland Conservatorium Griffith University|Queensland Conservatorium]]) and the [[The Australian Voices|Australian Voices]] choir collaborated on \"Grevilleas of Myall Park\", inspired by the flora of the park. Commissioned artworks are located throughout the garden.<ref name=qhr/>\n\n== Description ==\nMyall Park Botanic Garden is located approximately {{convert|7|km}} north-west of Glenmorgan in the Western Downs region, Queensland. Within its {{convert|132.3|ha}} property boundary is a garden landscape of Australian flora of approximately {{convert|90|ha}}. The site is mostly flat, fenced along its property boundary, and includes a cluster of small timber buildings close to its eastern boundary. The site, formerly part of a large pastoral property is largely surrounded by a rural landscape used for grazing and cropping.<ref name=qhr/>\n\nRetained local brigalow-belah vegetation provides a bush setting for the botanic garden. The garden comprises thousands of ex situ Australian arid, semi-arid and dry tropical plants, mostly indigenous to other parts of Queensland and Australia. While the aesthetic of the garden is reflective of an uncultivated inland bush landscape, there is an underlying formality in the layout. The garden is organised into approximately 72 divisions, defined by timber corner pegs. Within the original divisions laid out by David Gordon, plants are grown according to their species, in some instances on raised gravel beds, and are located adjacent to other divisions within their genus. More recent divisions established in the garden generally feature plants from different genera; this occurs in response to soil and climatic variables within the garden or for a particular educational or scientific focus.<ref name=qhr/>\n\nSoil types within the garden include neutral grey brigalow soil, light loams over clays, red lateritic acid gravel, and a layer of blue/grey clay. Some plantings, including some of the oldest in the eucalypt divisions, may not initially appear their age because of the growing conditions and the particular characteristics of the plants. Plants are often marked with a timber stake with identification tags that include their species and planting date.<ref name=qhr/>\n\nReflective of natural growing conditions, established plants receive minimal maintenance. Ground cover, where it exists, is generally not mown in the majority of the grounds, to foster and shelter any unassisted germination. Within the garden, plant labelling and interpretative signage is intentionally unobtrusive.<ref name=qhr/>\n\nLarge water tanks on tall stands are positioned within the garden. Early galvanised steel irrigation pipes are laid throughout the garden and retain sprinkler heads, although these are not in use. A dam for the garden's water purposes is situated on the north-west boundary of the property.<ref name=qhr/>\n\nA looping gravel drive circulates through the site, entering from the eastern side of the property and broadly follows the edges of the garden, as laid out by David Gordon. A number of dirt walking paths meander through different sections of the garden.<ref name=qhr/>\n\nThe original Grevillea \"Robyn Gordon\" is located in a grevillea division close to the western edge of the garden. Together with the other Gordon hybrids, it is featured on the \"Gordon Grevilleas Walk\". Examples of the parent plants Grevillea bipinnatifida and G. banksii, are planted directly adjacent. Grevillea \"Sandra Gordon\" and G. \"Merinda Gordon\" are planted nearby, although these are not the original plants.<ref name=qhr/>\n\nThe gallery and toilets (1995) and the old sawmill [[shed]] (mostly reconstructed) near the entry of the park are not of cultural heritage significance although they are important components in the current day activities of the garden. A number of artworks (not of cultural heritage significance) are located throughout the garden.<ref name=qhr/>\n\nNear the eastern edge of the garden, south-east of the gallery is the cluster of buildings comprising Terpersie Cottage (former nurseryman's residence), the nursery, the garage, and the single men's shearers' quarters. To the south of this group is Avochie Cottage.<ref name=qhr/>\n\nTerpersie Cottage is a small low-set single-storey timber residence. It has a multi-hipped roof clad with corrugated metal sheets and a weatherboard exterior. A large brick [[chimney]] is on the eastern side and a [[screened porch]] is on the north-eastern corner. The building is highly-intact, with very little alteration evident.<ref name=qhr/>\n\nThe nursery comprises two single-storey timber-framed buildings connected by a covered entry to form an L-shape around a fenced yard. The long wing accommodates the potting room (slab-on-ground), seed storage room -a timber lined room, and a rear laundry and toilet. The potting room is unlined and includes timber benches clad with metal sheet, timber shelving and early gardening paraphernalia. The concrete floor has spoon drains now partially filled with cement. The seed room contains built-in silky-oak cupboards with many drawers containing seeds collected over a long period of time, most labelled with plant names. Some garden related archival records are also housed in the seed room.<ref name=qhr/>\n\nThe other wing of the nursery accommodates the misting house, a timber framed glasshouse with a concrete slab floor. The lower part of the walls is lined internally with fibre cement sheets. Above this on the side walls are clear glass operable louvres and on the end wall is a large timber-framed pivot window surrounded by fixed clear glass. The roof is clad with overlapping sheets of rippled, fixed glass and near the ridge are clear glass operable louvres. The roof is sheltered externally by a shade cloth mounted on a metal framing. This shade cloth is a later addition, replacing the original louvred panels. The room contains raised timber benches/boxes for plants that incorporate plastic irrigation pipes with misting nozzles. The floor retains spoon drains under the plant benches. The nursery yard retains four hardening bays. These are large timber \"boxes\" on legs that have a sheltering frame covered in shade cloth.<ref name=qhr/>\n\nAt the south eastern corner of the nursery yard is a garage. This is a single-storey, slab-on-ground building with a [[gable]] roof clad with corrugated metal sheets. It comprises three bays with a fourth bay accommodated in a lean-to on the eastern side. The exterior is weatherboards and the interior is unlined. The garage contains approximately 70 plastic tubs that temporarily holds the herbarium collection of Myall Park. The collection consists of thousands of pages of pressed plant specimens mounted on paper. Individual specimens, record collecting locations and dates, and botanical information.<ref name=qhr/>\n\nTo the north-east of the garage is the single men's Shearers' Quarters, an L-shaped single-storey low-set timber building with a chamferboard exterior and a gable roof clad with corrugated metal sheets. The long wing accommodates the shearers' bedrooms each with a timber built-in cupboard. The bedrooms are accessed from a long eastern verandah that is enclosed at either end for a bathroom. The short wing accommodates the cook's rooms including a kitchen with a stove recess retaining an early cast-iron stove and early built-in kitchen cupboards. At the junction of the two wings is a dining room with a servery into the kitchen and a large brick fireplace. The chimney breast has an external [[Apron (architecture)|apron]] that holds a [[laundry copper]].<ref name=qhr/>\n\nTo the south of this group is Avochie Cottage, a single-storey low-set timber residence with a [[chamferboard]] exterior and a multi-gabled roof clad with corrugated metal sheets. It accommodates three bedrooms, kitchen, lounge, bathroom, toilet, and a verandah on the southern side. It has two large brick [[chimneys]]; the kitchen chimney retains an early cast iron stove.<ref name=qhr/>\n\n== Heritage listing ==\nMyall Park Botanic Garden was listed on the [[Queensland Heritage Register]] on 9 November 2012 having satisfied the following criteria.<ref name=qhr/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history.'''\n\nMyall Park Botanic Garden is important in demonstrating the evolution of Queensland's private and botanic gardens. Established in 1941 by David Gordon, the garden developed from a unique private garden of native plants to an extensive botanic garden with significant conservation and horticultural values. In its earliest decades of development, the garden's scale and singular emphasis on collecting, growing and experimenting with native plants was unparalleled in Queensland. It is thought to be Queensland's oldest garden wholly devoted to Australian flora.<ref name=qhr/>\n\nAs the place where the hybrid Grevillea \"Robyn Gordon\" first appeared, one of Australia's most popular and widely planted cultivars, the garden is closely associated with the increasing use of native plants in Australian gardens from the 1960s. The first plant registered by the Australian Cultivar Registration Authority in 1973, the parent Grevillea \"Robyn Gordon\" remains in the garden.<ref name=qhr/>\n\nMyall Park Botanic Garden has fulfilled many of the traditional functions associated with botanical gardens since the 1940s; increasing horticultural and scientific knowledge about flora, sharing information, seed and plant stock with like-minded institutions, experts and enthusiasts, providing an attractive and educational venue for public recreation (since 1988); and in some instances, providing plant material to nurseries and the public.<ref name=qhr/>\n\n'''The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage.'''\n\nMyall Park Botanic Garden's important collection of garden plants, seed bank, herbarium specimens and detailed records, includes ex situ examples of Australian arid, semi-arid and dry tropical flora rare or threatened in their natural habitats in Queensland and other Australian states. The age and scope of this botanic garden is unique in the history of Queensland's gardens.<ref name=qhr/>\n\n'''The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of Queensland's history.'''\n\nMyall Park Botanic Garden's layout, flora, infrastructure, early gardening implements and collection of seeds, herbarium specimens and detailed records have the potential to yield important information related to historical horticultural practices and the conservation and knowledge of Australian flora.<ref name=qhr/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places.'''\n\nMyall Park Botanic Garden is important in demonstrating both the principal characteristics of botanic gardens in Queensland and significant variations within this place type. The garden's collection of living plants, complemented by the seed bank, herbarium specimens and detailed records, nursery and residence are all important elements shared with other botanic gardens. Contrasting with the more formal design features commonly associated with botanic gardens, it is located within a setting of local vegetation. The layout of the garden is organized into divisional sections without hard edged borders or lawns. Minimal maintenance practices on the plants and garden beds are more reflective of natural growing conditions.<ref name=qhr/>\n\nThe highly intact 1950s purpose-built nursery complex -housing potting and seed storage rooms, glasshouse, hardening bays and early gardening implements, together with the garden's irrigation infrastructure -illustrate the spaces, processes and structures used to establish and maintain the garden. The residence (Terpersie) located adjacent to the nursery demonstrates the provision of accommodation for the garden's nurserymen and their families.<ref name=qhr/>\n\nThe shearer's quarters are a good example of the type of worker's housing provided on pastoral properties following the introduction of workers accommodation legislation in Queensland in the early twentieth century. Highly intact, its principal characteristics include the building's location away from other buildings used for pastoral purposes, provision of a verandah and separate sleeping rooms for workers, kitchen and cook's quarters, and dining and bath rooms.<ref name=qhr/>\n\n'''The place is important because of its aesthetic significance.'''\n\nMyall Park Botanic Garden is important for its aesthetic significance, exhibiting picturesque qualities. It has distinct integrity as a cultivated landscape of only Australian native plants. It is a living place, constantly evolving, supporting a diversity of flora and fauna, and varying with the seasons. As such, it offers a changing mix of evocative and complex experiences that delight all the senses.<ref name=qhr/>\n\nThe importance of the aesthetic experience of Myall Park Botanic Garden has been demonstrated over many years in its popularity as a tourist destination and its inspiration for artists, writers, photographers, and musicians.<ref name=qhr/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating a high degree of creative or technical achievement at a particular period.'''\n\nThe successful creation of the hybrid Grevillea \"Robyn Gordon\", encouraged through a deliberate planting process, was an important technical achievement in the field of Australian floral horticulture in the 1960s. The first plant registered by the Australian Cultivar Registration Authority in 1973, it is now one of Australia's most popular and widely planted native plants. The parent Grevillea \"Robyn Gordon\" remains in the garden.<ref name=qhr/>\n\n'''The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons.'''\n\nMyall Park Botanic Garden has a special and longstanding association with gardening and Australian flora and fauna enthusiasts and experts. The garden's horticultural and conservation values have been recognised and appreciated since the 1950s. The garden has been a site of inspiration, education and research for naturalists, botanists and scientists and a range of specialist interest groups including the Society for Growing Australian Plants, the Australian Garden History Society and Birds Queensland.<ref name=qhr/>\n\nThrough their involvement as custodians, volunteers and supporters, the Myall Park Botanic Garden Limited, the Friends of Myall Park Botanic Garden, and the regional community have strong associations with the garden.<ref name=qhr/>\n\n'''The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history.'''\n\nMyall Park Botanic Garden has a special association with David and Dorothy Gordon. David Gordon AM (1899-2001) established the garden and was responsible its development for over 50 years. His wife Dorothy Gordon (1930\u201385) assisted David Gordon in the development of the garden for over 30 years, and promoted Australian flora through her botanical art. The Gordon's played an important role in fostering the appreciation of Australian flora for horticulture and conservation in Queensland and the nation.<ref name=qhr/>\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n===Sources===\n* {{cite book|last=Mackenzie|first=Betty|date=1995|title=One Man's Dream: David Gordon and Myall Park Botanic Garden|publisher=Myall Park Botanic Garden|location=Glenmorgan}}\n\n=== Attribution ===\n{{QHR-CC-2014}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* {{Citation|title=One man's dream : David Gordon and Myall Park Botanic Garden|publication-date=1995|author1=McKenzie, Betty|author2=Myall Park Botanic Garden|publisher=Myall Park Botanic Garden|isbn=978-0-646-19463-9}}\n* {{Citation|title=Australian wildflower paintings|publication-date=1987|author1=Gordon, Dorothy|author2=Gordon, David M.

Historian Peter Yearwood argues that when the new coalition government of [[Lloyd George ministry|David Lloyd George]] took power in December 1916, there was widespread discussion among intellectuals and diplomats of the desirability of establishing such an organisation. When Lloyd George was challenged by Wilson to state his position with an eye on the postwar situation, he endorsed such an organisation.  Wilson himself included in his [[Fourteen Points]] in January 1918 a \"league of nations to ensure peace and justice.\" British foreign secretary, [[Arthur Balfour]], argued that, as a condition of durable peace, \"behind international law, and behind all treaty arrangements for preventing or limiting hostilities, some form of international sanction should be devised which would give pause to the hardiest aggressor.\"<ref>Peter Yearwood, \"\u2018On the Safe and Right Lines\u2019: The Lloyd George Government and the Origins of the League of Nations, 1916\u20131918.\" ''Historical Journal'' 32#1 (1989): 131\u2013155.</ref>\n\nThe war had had a profound impact, affecting the social, political and economic systems of Europe and inflicting psychological and physical damage.<ref>P.

The causes identified included arms races, alliances, militaristic nationalism, secret diplomacy, and the freedom of sovereign states to enter into war for their own benefit. One proposed remedy was the creation of an international organisation whose aim was to prevent future war through disarmament, open diplomacy, international co-operation, restrictions on the right to wage war, and penalties that made war unattractive.{{sfn|Bell|2007|p=8}}\n\nIn London Balfour commissioned the first official report into the matter in early 1918, under the initiative of Lord [[Robert Cecil, 1st Viscount Cecil of Chelwood|Robert Cecil]].

Most of these questions were handled by the victorious Allied powers in bodies such as the Allied Supreme Council. The Allies tended to refer only particularly difficult matters to the League. This meant that, during the early [[interwar period]], the League played little part in resolving the turmoil resulting from the war. The questions the League considered in its early years included those designated by the Paris Peace treaties.{{sfn|Northedge|1986|pp=70\u201372}}\n\nAs the League developed, its role expanded, and by the middle of the 1920s it had become the centre of international activity. This change can be seen in the relationship between the League and non-members. The United States and Russia, for example, increasingly worked with the League. During the second half of the 1920s, France, Britain and Germany were all using the League of Nations as the focus of their diplomatic activity, and each of their foreign secretaries attended League meetings at Geneva during this period. They also used the League's machinery to try to improve relations and settle their differences.{{sfn|Henig|1973|p=170.}}\n\n===\u00c5land Islands===\n{{Main|\u00c5land crisis}}\n[[\u00c5land]] is a collection of around 6,500 islands in the Baltic Sea, midway between [[Sweden]] and [[Finland]]. The islands are almost exclusively [[Swedish language|Swedish]]-speaking, but in 1809, the \u00c5land Islands, along with Finland, were taken by [[Russian Empire|Imperial Russia]]. In December 1917, during the turmoil of the Russian [[October Revolution]], Finland declared its independence, but most of the \u00c5landers wished to rejoin Sweden.{{sfn|Scott|1973|p=60}} The Finnish government considered the islands to be a part of their new nation, as the Russians had included \u00c5land in the [[Grand Duchy of Finland]], formed in 1809. By 1920, the dispute had escalated to the point that there was danger of war. The British government referred the problem to the League's Council, but Finland would not let the League intervene, as they considered it an internal matter. The League created a small panel to decide if it should investigate the matter and, with an affirmative response, a neutral commission was created.{{sfn|Scott|1973|p=60}} In June 1921, the League announced its decision: the islands were to remain a part of Finland, but with guaranteed protection of the islanders, including demilitarisation. With Sweden's reluctant agreement, this became the first European international agreement concluded directly through the League.{{sfn|Northedge|1986|pp=77\u201378}}\n\n===Upper Silesia===\nThe Allied powers referred the problem of [[Upper Silesia]] to the League after they had been unable to resolve the territorial dispute.{{sfn|Scott|1973|pp=82\u201383}} After the First World War, [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]] laid claim to Upper Silesia, which had been part of [[Prussia]]. The Treaty of Versailles had recommended a [[Upper Silesia plebiscite|plebiscite in Upper Silesia]] to determine whether the territory should become part of Germany or Poland. Complaints about the attitude of the German authorities led to rioting and eventually to the first two [[Silesian Uprisings]] (1919 and 1920). A plebiscite took place on 20 March 1921, with 59.6 per cent (around 500,000) of the votes cast in favour of joining Germany, but Poland claimed the conditions surrounding it had been unfair. This result led to the [[Third Silesian Uprising]] in 1921.{{sfn|Osmanczyk|Mango|2002|p=2568}}\n\nOn 12 August 1921, the League was asked to settle the matter; the Council created a commission with representatives from Belgium, Brazil, China and Spain to study the situation.{{sfn|Northedge|1986|p=88}} The committee recommended that Upper Silesia be divided between Poland and Germany according to the preferences shown in the plebiscite and that the two sides should decide the details of the interaction between the two areas \u2013 for example, whether goods should pass freely over the border due to the economic and industrial interdependence of the two areas.{{sfn|Scott|1973|pp=83}} In November 1921, a conference was held in Geneva to negotiate a convention between Germany and Poland. A final settlement was reached, after five meetings, in which most of the area was given to Germany, but with the Polish section containing the majority of the region's mineral resources and much of its industry. When this agreement became public in May 1922, bitter resentment was expressed in Germany, but the treaty was still ratified by both countries. The settlement produced peace in the area until the beginning of the Second World War.{{sfn|Northedge|1986|p=88}}\n\n===Albania===\nThe frontiers of the [[Principality of Albania]] had not been set during the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]] in 1919, as they were left for the League to decide; they had not yet been determined by September 1921, creating an unstable situation. [[Kingdom of Greece (Gl\u00fccksburg)|Greek]] troops conducted military operations in the south of Albania. [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] (Yugoslav) forces became engaged, after clashes with Albanian tribesmen, in the northern part of the country. The League sent a commission of representatives from various powers to the region. In November 1921, the League decided that the frontiers of Albania should be the same as they had been in 1913, with three minor changes that favoured Yugoslavia. Yugoslav forces withdrew a few weeks later, albeit under protest.{{sfn|Northedge|1986|pp=103\u2013105}}\n\nThe borders of Albania again became the cause of international conflict when Italian General [[Enrico Tellini]] and four of his assistants were ambushed and killed on 24 August 1923 while marking out the newly decided border between Greece and Albania. Italian leader [[Benito Mussolini]] was incensed and demanded that a commission investigate the incident within five days. Whatever the results of the investigation, Mussolini insisted that the Greek government pay Italy fifty million [[Italian lira|lire]] in reparations. The Greeks said they would not pay unless it was proved that the crime was committed by Greeks.{{sfn|Scott|1973|p=86}}\n\nMussolini sent a warship to shell the Greek island of [[Corfu]], and Italian forces [[Corfu incident|occupied the island]] on 31 August 1923. This contravened the League's covenant, so Greece appealed to the League to deal with the situation. The Allies agreed (at Mussolini's insistence) that the [[Conference of Ambassadors]] should be responsible for resolving the dispute because it was the conference that had appointed General Tellini. The League Council examined the dispute, but then passed on their findings to the Conference of Ambassadors to make the final decision. The conference accepted most of the League's recommendations, forcing Greece to pay fifty million lire to Italy, even though those who committed the crime were never discovered.{{sfn|Scott|1973|p=87}} Italian forces then withdrew from Corfu.{{sfn|Northedge|1986|p=110}}\n\n===Memel===\n{{Main|Klaip\u0117da Revolt}}\nThe port city of [[Klaip\u0117da|Memel]] (now [[Klaip\u0117da]]) and [[Klaip\u0117da Region|the surrounding area]], with a predominantly German population, was under provisional Entente control according to Article 99 of the Treaty of Versailles. The French and Polish governments favoured turning Memel into an [[international city]], while [[Lithuania]] wanted to annex the area. By 1923, the fate of the area had still not been decided, prompting Lithuanian forces to invade in January 1923 and seize the port. After the Allies failed to reach an agreement with Lithuania, they referred the matter to the League of Nations. In December 1923, the League Council appointed a Commission of Inquiry. The commission chose to cede Memel to Lithuania and give the area autonomous rights. The [[Klaip\u0117da Convention]] was approved by the League Council on 14 March 1924, and then by the Allied powers and Lithuania.{{sfn|Northedge|1986|p=107}} In 1939 Germany retook the region following the rise of the [[Nazism|Nazis]] and an [[1939 German ultimatum to Lithuania|ultimatum to Lithuania]], demanding the return of the region under threat of war. The League of Nations failed to prevent the secession of the Memel region to Germany.\n\n===Hatay===\n{{Main|Hatay State}}\nWith League oversight, the [[Sanjak]] of [[\u0130skenderun|Alexandretta]] in the [[French Mandate of Syria and the Lebanon|French Mandate of Syria]] was given autonomy in 1937. Renamed Hatay, its parliament declared independence as the [[Hatay State|Republic of Hatay]] in September 1938, after elections the previous month.

According to the British, who had been awarded a League of Nations [[Kingdom of Iraq (Mandate administration)|mandate over Iraq]] in 1920 and therefore represented Iraq in its foreign affairs, Mosul belonged to Iraq; on the other hand, the new Turkish republic claimed the province as part of its historic heartland. A League of Nations Commission of Inquiry, with Belgian, Hungarian and Swedish members, was sent to the region in 1924; it found that the people of Mosul did not want to be part of either Turkey or Iraq, but if they had to choose, they would pick Iraq.{{sfn|Scott|1973|p=133}} In 1925, the commission recommended that the region stay part of Iraq, under the condition that the British hold the mandate over Iraq for another 25 years, to ensure the autonomous rights of the [[Kurdish people|Kurdish]] population. The League Council adopted the recommendation and decided on 16 December 1925 to award Mosul to Iraq. Although Turkey had accepted the League of Nations' arbitration in the [[Treaty of Lausanne (1923)]], it rejected the decision, questioning the Council's authority. The matter was referred to the Permanent Court of International Justice, which ruled that, when the Council made a unanimous decision, it must be accepted. Nonetheless, Britain, Iraq and Turkey ratified a separate treaty on 5 June 1926 that mostly followed the decision of the League Council and also assigned Mosul to Iraq. It was agreed that Iraq could still apply for League membership within 25 years and that the mandate would end upon its admission.{{sfn|Northedge|1986|pp=107\u2013108}}{{sfn|Scott|1973|pp=131\u2013135}}\n\n===Vilnius===\n{{Main|\u017beligowski's Mutiny}}\nAfter the First World War, Poland and Lithuania both regained their independence but soon became immersed in territorial disputes.{{sfn|Northedge|1986|p=78}} During the [[Polish\u2013Soviet War]], Lithuania signed the [[Soviet\u2013Lithuanian Peace Treaty|Moscow Peace Treaty]] with the Soviet Union that laid out Lithuania's frontiers. This agreement gave Lithuanians control of the city of [[Vilnius]] ({{lang-lt|Vilnius}}, {{lang-pl|Wilno}}), the old Lithuanian capital, but a city with a majority Polish population.{{sfn|Scott|1973|p=61}} This heightened tension between Lithuania and Poland and led to fears that they would resume the [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian War]], and on 7 October 1920, the League negotiated the [[Suwa\u0142ki Agreement]] establishing a cease-fire and a demarcation line between the two nations.{{sfn|Northedge|1986|p=78}} On 9 October 1920, General [[Lucjan \u017beligowski]], commanding a Polish military force in contravention of the Suwa\u0142ki Agreement, took the city and established the [[Republic of Central Lithuania]].{{sfn|Northedge|1986|p=78}}\n\nAfter a request for assistance from Lithuania, the League Council called for Poland's withdrawal from the area. The Polish government indicated they would comply, but instead reinforced the city with more Polish troops.{{sfn|Scott|1973|p=62}} This prompted the League to decide that the future of Vilnius should be determined by its residents in a plebiscite and that the Polish forces should withdraw and be replaced by an international force organised by the League. The plan was met with resistance in Poland, Lithuania, and the Soviet Union, which opposed any international force in Lithuania. In March 1921, the League abandoned plans for the plebiscite.{{sfn|Scott|1973|p=63}} After unsuccessful proposals by [[Paul Hymans]] to create a federation between Poland and Lithuania, which was intended as a reincarnation of the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth|former union which both Poland and Lithuania]] had once shared before losing its independence, Vilnius and the surrounding area was formally annexed by Poland in March 1922. After Lithuania took over the [[Klaip\u0117da Region]], the [[Conference of Ambassadors|Allied Conference]] set the frontier between Lithuania and Poland, leaving Vilnius within Poland, on 14 March 1923.{{sfn|Northedge|1986|pp=78\u201379}} Lithuanian authorities refused to accept the decision, and officially remained in a state of war with Poland until 1927.{{sfn|Bell|2007|p=29}} It was not until the [[1938 Polish ultimatum to Lithuania|1938 Polish ultimatum]] that Lithuania restored diplomatic relations with Poland and thus ''de facto'' accepted the borders.{{sfn|Crampton|1996|p=93}}\n\n===Colombia and Peru===\n{{Main|Colombia\u2013Peru War|Leticia dispute}}\nThere were several border conflicts between [[Colombia]] and [[Peru]] in the early part of the 20th century, and in 1922, their governments signed the [[Salom\u00f3n-Lozano Treaty]] in an attempt to resolve them.{{sfn|Osmanczyk|Mango|2002|p=1314}} As part of this treaty, the border town of [[Leticia, Amazonas|Leticia]] and its surrounding area was ceded from Peru to Colombia, giving Colombia access to the [[Amazon River]].{{sfn|Scott|1973|p=249}} On 1 September 1932, business leaders from Peruvian rubber and sugar industries who had lost land, as a result, organised an armed takeover of Leticia.{{sfn|Bethell|1991|pp=414\u2013415}} At first, the [[Peruvian government]] did not recognise the military takeover, but [[President of Peru]] [[Luis Miguel S\u00e1nchez Cerro|Luis S\u00e1nchez Cerro]] decided to resist a Colombian re-occupation. The [[Peruvian Army]] occupied Leticia, leading to an armed conflict between the two nations.{{sfn|Scott|1973|p=250}} After months of diplomatic negotiations, the governments accepted mediation by the League of Nations, and their representatives presented their cases before the Council.

The report passed 42\u20131 in the Assembly in 1933 (only Japan voting against), but instead of removing its troops from China, Japan withdrew from the League.{{sfn|Northedge|1986|pp=156\u2013161}} In the end,  as British historian [[Charles Mowat]] argued, collective security was dead:\n:The League and the ideas of collective security and the rule of law were defeated; partly because of indifference and of sympathy with the aggressor, but partly because the League powers were unprepared, preoccupied with other matters, and too slow to perceive the scale of Japanese ambitions.<ref>Charles Loch Mowat, ''Britain between the Wars 1918\u20131940'' (1955) p. 420.</ref>\n\n===Chaco War===\n{{Main|Chaco War}}\nThe League failed to prevent the 1932 war between [[Bolivia]] and [[Paraguay]] over the arid [[Gran Chaco]] region.

Mussolini was prepared to agree to the pact, but news of the deal leaked out. Both the British and French public vehemently protested against it, describing it as a sell-out of Abyssinia.

The League members would not intervene in the Spanish Civil War nor prevent foreign intervention in the conflict. [[Adolf Hitler]] and Mussolini continued to aid General [[Francisco Franco]]'s Nationalists, while the Soviet Union helped the Spanish Republic. In February 1937, the League did ban [[International Brigades|foreign volunteers]], but this was in practice a symbolic move.{{sfn|Northedge|1986|pp=264\u2013265, 269\u2013270}}\n\n===Second Sino-Japanese War===\n{{Main|Second Sino-Japanese War}}\nFollowing a long record of instigating localised conflicts throughout the 1930s, Japan began a full-scale invasion of China on 7 July 1937.

The French were reluctant to reduce their armaments without a guarantee of military help if they were attacked; Poland and [[Czechoslovakia]] felt vulnerable to attack from the west and wanted the League's response to aggression against its members to be strengthened before they disarmed.{{sfn|Henig|1973|p=173}} Without this guarantee, they would not reduce armaments because they felt the risk of attack from Germany was too great. Fear of attack increased as Germany regained its strength after the First World War, especially after Adolf Hitler gained power and became [[Adolf Hitler's rise to power|German Chancellor in 1933]]. In particular, Germany's attempts to overturn the Treaty of Versailles and the reconstruction of the German military made France increasingly unwilling to disarm.{{sfn|Northedge|1986|p=114}}\n\nThe [[World Disarmament Conference]] was convened by the League of Nations in Geneva in 1932, with representatives from 60 states. It was a failure.<ref>A.C.

Ultimately, the Commission failed to halt the military build-up by Germany, Italy, Spain and Japan during the 1930s.\n\nThe League was mostly silent in the face of major events leading to the Second World War, such as Hitler's [[remilitarisation of the Rhineland]], occupation of the [[Sudetenland]] and ''[[Anschluss]]'' of [[Austria]], which had been forbidden by the Treaty of Versailles. In fact, League members themselves re-armed. In 1933, Japan simply withdrew from the League rather than submit to its judgement,<ref>{{cite book|first=Meirion and Susie|last=Harries|title=Soldiers of the Sun: The Rise and Fall of the Imperial Japanese Army|page=163|isbn=978-0-394-56935-2|year=1991}}</ref> as did Germany the same year (using the failure of the World Disarmament Conference to agree to arms parity between France and Germany as a pretext), Italy and Spain in 1937.{{sfn|Northedge|1986|pp=47, 133}} The final significant act of the League was to expel the Soviet Union in December 1939 after [[Winter War|it invaded Finland]].{{sfn|Northedge|1986|p=273}}\n\n==General weaknesses==\n[[File:The Gap in the Bridge.png|thumb|'''The Gap in the Bridge'''; the sign reads \"This League of Nations Bridge was designed by the President of the U.S.A.\"\nCartoon from ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'' magazine, 10 December 1920, satirising the gap left by the US not joining the League.]]\nThe onset of the Second World War demonstrated that the League had failed in its primary purpose, the prevention of another world war. There were a variety of reasons for this failure, many connected to general weaknesses within the organisation. Additionally, the power of the League was limited by the United States' refusal to join.{{sfn|Northedge|1986|pp=276\u2013278}}\n\n===Origins and structure===\nThe origins of the League as an organisation created by the Allied powers as part of the peace settlement to end the First World War led to it being viewed as a \"League of Victors\".{{sfn|Gorodetsky|1994|p=26}}{{sfn|Raffo|1974|p=1}} The League's neutrality tended to manifest itself as indecision. It required a unanimous vote of nine, later fifteen, Council members to enact a resolution; hence, conclusive and effective action was difficult, if not impossible. It was also slow in coming to its decisions, as certain ones required the unanimous consent of the entire Assembly. This problem mainly stemmed from the fact that the primary members of the League of Nations were not willing to accept the possibility of their fate being decided by other countries, and by enforcing unanimous voting had effectively given themselves veto power.<ref>{{cite book|pages=226\u2013227|author=Birn, Donald S|publisher=Clarendon Press|year=1981|title=The League of Nations Union|isbn=978-0-19-822650-5}}</ref>{{sfn|Northedge|1986|pp=279\u2013282, 288\u2013292}}\n\n===Global representation===\nRepresentation at the League was often a problem. Though it was intended to encompass all nations, many never joined, or their period of membership was short. The most conspicuous absentee was the United States. President Woodrow Wilson had been a driving force behind the League's formation and strongly influenced the form it took, but the US Senate voted not to join on 19 November 1919.{{sfn|Knock|1995|p=263}} [[Ruth Henig, Baroness Henig|Ruth Henig]] has suggested that, had the United States become a member, it would have also provided support to France and Britain, possibly making France feel more secure, and so encouraging France and Britain to co-operate more fully regarding Germany, thus making the rise to power of the [[Nazi Party]] less likely.{{sfn|Henig|1973|p=175}} Conversely, Henig acknowledges that if the US had been a member, its reluctance to engage in war with European states or to enact economic sanctions might have hampered the ability of the League to deal with [[international incident]]s.{{sfn|Henig|1973|p=175}} The structure of the [[Federal government of the United States|US federal government]] might also have made its membership problematic, as its representatives at the League could not have made decisions on behalf of the [[Executive (government)|executive branch]] without having the prior approval of the [[United States Congress|legislative branch]].{{sfn|Henig|1973|p=176}}\n\nIn January 1920, when the League was born, Germany was not permitted to join because it was seen as having been the aggressor in the First World War. [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Soviet Russia]] was also initially excluded because Communist regimes were not welcomed and membership would have been initially dubious due to the [[Russian Civil War]] in which both sides claimed to be the legitimate government of the country. The League was further weakened when major powers left in the 1930s. Japan began as a permanent member of the Council since the country was an Allied Power in the First World War, but withdrew in 1933 after the League voiced opposition to its occupation of Manchuria.{{sfn|McDonough|1997|p=62}} Italy began as a permanent member of the Council but withdrew in 1937 after roughly a year following the end of the [[Second Italo-Ethiopian War]]. Spain also began as a permanent member of the Council, but withdrew in 1939 after the [[Spanish Civil War]] ended in a victory for the Nationalists. The League had accepted Germany, also as a permanent member of the Council, in 1926, deeming it a \"peace-loving country\", but Adolf Hitler pulled Germany out when he came to power in 1933.{{sfn|McDonough|1997|p=69}}\n\n===Collective security===\nAnother important weakness grew from the contradiction between the idea of [[collective security]] that formed the basis of the League and [[international relations]] between individual states.{{sfn|Northedge|1986|p=253}} The League's collective security system required nations to act, if necessary, against states they considered friendly, and in a way that might endanger their [[national interest]]s, to support states for which they had no normal affinity.{{sfn|Northedge|1986|p=253}} This weakness was exposed during the [[Abyssinia Crisis]], when Britain and France had to balance maintaining the security they had attempted to create for themselves in Europe \"to defend against the enemies of internal order\",{{sfn|Northedge|1986|p=254}} in which Italy's support played a pivotal role, with their obligations to Abyssinia as a member of the League.{{sfn|Northedge|1986|pp=253\u2013254}}\n\nOn 23 June 1936, in the wake of the collapse of League efforts to restrain Italy's war against Abyssinia, the British Prime Minister, [[Stanley Baldwin]], told the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] that collective security had {{quote|failed ultimately because of the reluctance of nearly all the nations in Europe to proceed to what I might call military sanctions ... The real reason, or the main reason, was that we discovered in the process of weeks that there was no country except the aggressor country which was ready for war ... [I]f collective action is to be a reality and not merely a thing to be talked about, it means not only that every country is to be ready for war; but must be ready to go to war at once. That is a terrible thing, but it is an essential part of collective security.<ref name = \"events\" />}}\n\nUltimately, Britain and France both abandoned the concept of collective security in favour of [[appeasement]] in the face of growing German militarism under Hitler.{{sfn|McDonough|1997|p=74}}\nIn this context, the League of Nations was also the institution where the first international debate on terrorism took place following the 1934 assassination of [[King Alexander I of Yugoslavia]] in [[Marseille]], [[France]], showing its conspiratorial features, many of which are detectable in the discourse of terrorism among states after [[9/11]].<ref>Ditrych, Ondrej.

[[Historical Social Research]] Vol. 38, 1 (2013).</ref>\n\nAmerican diplomatic historian [[Samuel Flagg Bemis]] originally supported the League,  but after two decades changed his mind:\n:The League of Nations has been a disappointing failure.... It has been a failure, not because the United States did not join it; but because the great powers have been unwilling to apply sanctions except where it suited their individual national interests to do so, and because Democracy, on which the original concepts of the League rested for support, has collapsed over half the world.<ref>Quoted in Jerald A. Combs, 'American diplomatic history: two centuries of changing interpretations (1983) p 158.</ref>\n\n===Pacifism and disarmament===\nThe League of Nations lacked an armed force of its own and depended on the Great Powers to enforce its resolutions, which they were very unwilling to do.{{sfn|McDonough|1997|pp=54\u20135}} Its two most important members, Britain and France, were reluctant to use sanctions and even more reluctant to resort to military action on behalf of the League. Immediately after the First World War, [[pacifism]] became a strong force among both the people and governments of the two countries. The [[Conservative Party (UK)|British Conservatives]] were especially tepid to the League and preferred, when in government, to negotiate treaties without the involvement of that organisation.{{sfn|Northedge|1986|pp=238\u2013240}} Moreover, the League's advocacy of disarmament for Britain, France, and its other members, while at the same time advocating collective security, meant that the League was depriving itself of the only forceful means by which it could uphold its authority.{{sfn|Northedge|1986|pp=134\u2013135}}\n\nWhen the British cabinet discussed the concept of the League during the First World War, [[Maurice Hankey, 1st Baron Hankey|Maurice Hankey]], the [[Cabinet Secretary]], circulated a memorandum on the subject. He started by saying, \"Generally it appears to me that any such scheme is dangerous to us because it will create a sense of security which is wholly fictitious\".{{sfn|Barnett|1972|p=245}} He attacked the British pre-war faith in the sanctity of treaties as delusional and concluded by claiming:\n\n{{quote|It [a League of Nations] will only result in failure and the longer that failure is postponed the more certain it is that this country will have been lulled to sleep. It will put a very strong lever into the hands of the well-meaning idealists who are to be found in almost every Government, who deprecate expenditure on armaments, and, in the course of time, it will almost certainly result in this country being caught at a disadvantage.{{sfn|Barnett|1972|p=245}}}}\n\nThe Foreign Office civil servant Sir [[Eyre Crowe]] also wrote a memorandum to the British cabinet claiming that \"a solemn league and covenant\" would just be \"a treaty, like other treaties\". \"What is there to ensure that it will not, like other treaties, be broken?\" Crowe went on to express scepticism of the planned \"pledge of common action\" against aggressors because he believed the actions of individual states would still be determined by national interests and the balance of power.

[[Covenant of the League of Nations]] was signed on 28 June 1919 as Part I of the [[Treaty of Versailles]], and it became effective together with the rest of the Treaty on 10 January 1920. The first meeting of the Council of the League took place on 16 January 1920, and the first meeting of Assembly of the League took place on 15 November 1920.\n\nThe diplomatic philosophy behind the League represented a fundamental shift from the preceding hundred years. The League lacked its own armed force and depended on the victorious [[Allies of World War I|First World War Allies]] (France, the United Kingdom, Italy and Japan were the permanent members of the Executive Council) to enforce its resolutions, keep to its economic sanctions, or provide an army when needed. The [[Great Power#Great powers at war|Great Powers]] were often reluctant to do so. Sanctions could hurt League members, so they were reluctant to comply with them. During the [[Second Italo-Abyssinian War]], when the League accused Italian soldiers of targeting [[Red Cross]] medical tents, [[Benito Mussolini]] responded that \"the League is very well when sparrows shout, but no good at all when eagles fall out.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oldsite.transnational.org/Area_MiddleEast/2008/Jahanpour_SC-Iran.pdf|title=The Elusiveness of Trust: the experience of Security Council and Iran|accessdate=27 June 2008|publisher=Transnational Foundation of Peace and Future Research|last=Jahanpour|first=Farhang|page=2|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140727102504/http://www.oldsite.transnational.org/Area_MiddleEast/2008/Jahanpour_SC-Iran.pdf|archive-date=27 July 2014|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nAt its greatest extent from 28 September 1934 to 23 February 1935, it had 58 members. After some notable successes and some early failures in the 1920s, the League ultimately proved incapable of preventing aggression by the [[Axis powers]] in the 1930s. The credibility of the organization was weakened by the fact that the [[United States]] never joined the League and the [[Soviet Union]] joined late and was soon expelled after [[Winter War|invading Finland]].<ref>{{cite book | title=The participation of the Soviet Union in universal international organizations.: A political and legal analysis of Soviet strategies and aspirations inside ILO, UNESCO and WHO | author=Osakwe, C O | year=1972 | publisher=Springer | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e2OmtJvNjHoC | page=5| isbn=978-9028600027 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book | author=Pericles, Lewis | year=2000 | publisher=Cambridge University Press | title=Modernism, Nationalism, and the Novel | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=F-ImKOwYvsoC | page=52| isbn=9781139426589 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book | title=Historical Dictionary of the League of Nations | author=Ginneken, Anique H.

By 1916 in Britain, the leader of the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]], and in the neutral United States, long-range thinkers had begun to design a unified international organisation to prevent future wars. Historian Peter Yearwood argues that when the new coalition government of [[Lloyd George ministry|David Lloyd George]] took power in December 1916, there was widespread discussion among intellectuals and diplomats of the desirability of establishing such an organisation. When Lloyd George was challenged by Wilson to state his position with an eye on the postwar situation, he endorsed such an organisation.  Wilson himself included in his [[Fourteen Points]] in January 1918 a \"league of nations to ensure peace and justice.\" British foreign secretary, [[Arthur Balfour]], argued that, as a condition of durable peace, \"behind international law, and behind all treaty arrangements for preventing or limiting hostilities, some form of international sanction should be devised which would give pause to the hardiest aggressor.\"<ref>Peter Yearwood, \"\u2018On the Safe and Right Lines\u2019: The Lloyd George Government and the Origins of the League of Nations, 1916\u20131918.\" ''Historical Journal'' 32#1 (1989): 131\u2013155.</ref>\n\nThe war had had a profound impact, affecting the social, political and economic systems of Europe and inflicting psychological and physical damage.<ref>P.

Anti-war sentiment rose across the world; the First World War was described as \"[[The war to end war|the war to end all wars]]\",{{sfn|Archer|2001|p=14}} and its possible causes were vigorously investigated. The causes identified included arms races, alliances, militaristic nationalism, secret diplomacy, and the freedom of sovereign states to enter into war for their own benefit. One proposed remedy was the creation of an international organisation whose aim was to prevent future war through disarmament, open diplomacy, international co-operation, restrictions on the right to wage war, and penalties that made war unattractive.{{sfn|Bell|2007|p=8}}\n\nIn London Balfour commissioned the first official report into the matter in early 1918, under the initiative of Lord [[Robert Cecil, 1st Viscount Cecil of Chelwood|Robert Cecil]].

Its constitution differed from that of the League: representation had been accorded not only to governments but also to representatives of employers' and workers' organisations.

The Committee's purpose was to conduct inquiries, oversee the operation of the League's health work, and prepare work to be presented to the Council.{{sfn|Northedge|1986|p=182}} This body focused on ending [[leprosy]], [[malaria]], and [[yellow fever]], the latter two by starting an international campaign to exterminate mosquitoes. The Health Organisation also worked successfully with the government of the Soviet Union to prevent [[typhus]] epidemics, including organising a large education campaign.{{sfn|Baumslag|2005|p=8}}\n\nThe League of Nations had devoted serious attention to the question of international intellectual co-operation since its creation.{{sfn|Grandjean|2018}} The First Assembly in December 1920 recommended that the Council take action aiming at the international organisation of intellectual work, which it did by adopting a report presented by the Fifth Committee of the Second Assembly and inviting a Committee on Intellectual Cooperation to meet in Geneva in August 1922. The French philosopher [[Henri Bergson]] became the first chairman of the committee.{{sfn|Northedge|1986|pp=186\u2013187}} The work of the committee included: inquiry into the conditions of intellectual life, assistance to countries where intellectual life was endangered, creation of national committees for intellectual co-operation, co-operation with international intellectual organisations, protection of intellectual property, inter-university co-operation, co-ordination of bibliographical work and international interchange of publications, and international co-operation in archaeological research.{{sfn|Northedge|1986|pp=187\u2013189}}\n\nIntroduced by the second [[International Opium Convention]], the Permanent Central Opium Board had to supervise the statistical reports on trade in [[opium]], morphine, cocaine and heroin.

The League secured a commitment from [[Ethiopia]] to end slavery as a condition of membership in 1923, and worked with [[Liberia]] to abolish forced labour and intertribal slavery.

The first member to withdraw permanently from the League was [[Costa Rica]] on 22 January 1925; having joined on 16 December 1920, this also makes it the member to have most quickly withdrawn. Brazil was the first founding member to withdraw (14 June 1926), and [[Haiti]] the last (April 1942). [[Iraq]], which joined in 1932, was the first member that had previously been a [[League of Nations mandate]].{{sfn|Tripp|2002|p=75}}\n\nThe Soviet Union became a member on 18 September 1934,{{sfn|Scott|1973|pp=312, 398}} and was expelled on 14 December 1939{{sfn|Scott|1973|pp=312, 398}} for [[Winter War|invading Finland]]. In expelling the Soviet Union, the League broke its own rule: only 7 of 15 members of the Council voted for expulsion (United Kingdom, France, Belgium, Bolivia, Egypt, [[Union of South Africa|South Africa]], and the [[Dominican Republic]]), short of the majority required by the Covenant. Three of these members had been made Council members the day before the vote (South Africa, Bolivia, and Egypt).

The [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Peace Conference]] adopted the principle that these territories should be administered by different governments on behalf of the League \u2013 a system of national responsibility subject to international supervision.{{sfn|Northedge|1986|pp=192\u2013193}} This plan, defined as the [[League of Nations mandate|mandate system]], was adopted by the \"Council of Ten\" (the heads of government and foreign ministers of the main Allied powers: Britain, France, the United States, Italy, and Japan) on 30 January 1919 and transmitted to the League of Nations.<ref>{{cite journal|journal=Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science|volume=96|date=July 1921|title=The Mandate System of the League of Nations|pages=74\u201377|author=Myers, Denys P|doi=10.1177/000271622109600116|url=https://zenodo.org/record/1448676}}</ref>\n\nLeague of Nations mandates were established under Article 22 of the Covenant of the League of Nations.{{sfn|Northedge|1986|p=193}} The Permanent Mandates Commission supervised League of Nations mandates,{{sfn|Northedge|1986|p=198}} and also organised [[plebiscite]]s in disputed territories so that residents could decide which country they would join.

Fourteen mandate territories were divided up among seven mandatory powers: the United Kingdom, the Union of South Africa, France, Belgium, New Zealand, Australia and Japan.{{sfn|Northedge|1986|pp=194\u2013195}} With the exception of the [[Kingdom of Iraq]], which joined the League on 3 October 1932,{{sfn|Northedge|1986|p=216}} these territories did not begin to gain their independence until after the Second World War, in a process that did not end until 1990.

Most of these questions were handled by the victorious Allied powers in bodies such as the Allied Supreme Council. The Allies tended to refer only particularly difficult matters to the League. This meant that, during the early [[interwar period]], the League played little part in resolving the turmoil resulting from the war. The questions the League considered in its early years included those designated by the Paris Peace treaties.{{sfn|Northedge|1986|pp=70\u201372}}\n\nAs the League developed, its role expanded, and by the middle of the 1920s it had become the centre of international activity. This change can be seen in the relationship between the League and non-members. The United States and Russia, for example, increasingly worked with the League. During the second half of the 1920s, France, Britain and Germany were all using the League of Nations as the focus of their diplomatic activity, and each of their foreign secretaries attended League meetings at Geneva during this period. They also used the League's machinery to try to improve relations and settle their differences.{{sfn|Henig|1973|p=170.}}\n\n===\u00c5land Islands===\n{{Main|\u00c5land crisis}}\n[[\u00c5land]] is a collection of around 6,500 islands in the Baltic Sea, midway between [[Sweden]] and [[Finland]]. The islands are almost exclusively [[Swedish language|Swedish]]-speaking, but in 1809, the \u00c5land Islands, along with Finland, were taken by [[Russian Empire|Imperial Russia]]. In December 1917, during the turmoil of the Russian [[October Revolution]], Finland declared its independence, but most of the \u00c5landers wished to rejoin Sweden.{{sfn|Scott|1973|p=60}} The Finnish government considered the islands to be a part of their new nation, as the Russians had included \u00c5land in the [[Grand Duchy of Finland]], formed in 1809. By 1920, the dispute had escalated to the point that there was danger of war. The British government referred the problem to the League's Council, but Finland would not let the League intervene, as they considered it an internal matter. The League created a small panel to decide if it should investigate the matter and, with an affirmative response, a neutral commission was created.{{sfn|Scott|1973|p=60}} In June 1921, the League announced its decision: the islands were to remain a part of Finland, but with guaranteed protection of the islanders, including demilitarisation. With Sweden's reluctant agreement, this became the first European international agreement concluded directly through the League.{{sfn|Northedge|1986|pp=77\u201378}}\n\n===Upper Silesia===\nThe Allied powers referred the problem of [[Upper Silesia]] to the League after they had been unable to resolve the territorial dispute.{{sfn|Scott|1973|pp=82\u201383}} After the First World War, [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]] laid claim to Upper Silesia, which had been part of [[Prussia]]. The Treaty of Versailles had recommended a [[Upper Silesia plebiscite|plebiscite in Upper Silesia]] to determine whether the territory should become part of Germany or Poland. Complaints about the attitude of the German authorities led to rioting and eventually to the first two [[Silesian Uprisings]] (1919 and 1920). A plebiscite took place on 20 March 1921, with 59.6 per cent (around 500,000) of the votes cast in favour of joining Germany, but Poland claimed the conditions surrounding it had been unfair. This result led to the [[Third Silesian Uprising]] in 1921.{{sfn|Osmanczyk|Mango|2002|p=2568}}\n\nOn 12 August 1921, the League was asked to settle the matter; the Council created a commission with representatives from Belgium, Brazil, China and Spain to study the situation.{{sfn|Northedge|1986|p=88}} The committee recommended that Upper Silesia be divided between Poland and Germany according to the preferences shown in the plebiscite and that the two sides should decide the details of the interaction between the two areas \u2013 for example, whether goods should pass freely over the border due to the economic and industrial interdependence of the two areas.{{sfn|Scott|1973|pp=83}} In November 1921, a conference was held in Geneva to negotiate a convention between Germany and Poland. A final settlement was reached, after five meetings, in which most of the area was given to Germany, but with the Polish section containing the majority of the region's mineral resources and much of its industry. When this agreement became public in May 1922, bitter resentment was expressed in Germany, but the treaty was still ratified by both countries. The settlement produced peace in the area until the beginning of the Second World War.{{sfn|Northedge|1986|p=88}}\n\n===Albania===\nThe frontiers of the [[Principality of Albania]] had not been set during the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]] in 1919, as they were left for the League to decide; they had not yet been determined by September 1921, creating an unstable situation. [[Kingdom of Greece (Gl\u00fccksburg)|Greek]] troops conducted military operations in the south of Albania. [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] (Yugoslav) forces became engaged, after clashes with Albanian tribesmen, in the northern part of the country. The League sent a commission of representatives from various powers to the region. In November 1921, the League decided that the frontiers of Albania should be the same as they had been in 1913, with three minor changes that favoured Yugoslavia. Yugoslav forces withdrew a few weeks later, albeit under protest.{{sfn|Northedge|1986|pp=103\u2013105}}\n\nThe borders of Albania again became the cause of international conflict when Italian General [[Enrico Tellini]] and four of his assistants were ambushed and killed on 24 August 1923 while marking out the newly decided border between Greece and Albania. Italian leader [[Benito Mussolini]] was incensed and demanded that a commission investigate the incident within five days. Whatever the results of the investigation, Mussolini insisted that the Greek government pay Italy fifty million [[Italian lira|lire]] in reparations. The Greeks said they would not pay unless it was proved that the crime was committed by Greeks.{{sfn|Scott|1973|p=86}}\n\nMussolini sent a warship to shell the Greek island of [[Corfu]], and Italian forces [[Corfu incident|occupied the island]] on 31 August 1923. This contravened the League's covenant, so Greece appealed to the League to deal with the situation. The Allies agreed (at Mussolini's insistence) that the [[Conference of Ambassadors]] should be responsible for resolving the dispute because it was the conference that had appointed General Tellini. The League Council examined the dispute, but then passed on their findings to the Conference of Ambassadors to make the final decision. The conference accepted most of the League's recommendations, forcing Greece to pay fifty million lire to Italy, even though those who committed the crime were never discovered.{{sfn|Scott|1973|p=87}} Italian forces then withdrew from Corfu.{{sfn|Northedge|1986|p=110}}\n\n===Memel===\n{{Main|Klaip\u0117da Revolt}}\nThe port city of [[Klaip\u0117da|Memel]] (now [[Klaip\u0117da]]) and [[Klaip\u0117da Region|the surrounding area]], with a predominantly German population, was under provisional Entente control according to Article 99 of the Treaty of Versailles. The French and Polish governments favoured turning Memel into an [[international city]], while [[Lithuania]] wanted to annex the area. By 1923, the fate of the area had still not been decided, prompting Lithuanian forces to invade in January 1923 and seize the port. After the Allies failed to reach an agreement with Lithuania, they referred the matter to the League of Nations. In December 1923, the League Council appointed a Commission of Inquiry. The commission chose to cede Memel to Lithuania and give the area autonomous rights. The [[Klaip\u0117da Convention]] was approved by the League Council on 14 March 1924, and then by the Allied powers and Lithuania.{{sfn|Northedge|1986|p=107}} In 1939 Germany retook the region following the rise of the [[Nazism|Nazis]] and an [[1939 German ultimatum to Lithuania|ultimatum to Lithuania]], demanding the return of the region under threat of war.

According to the British, who had been awarded a League of Nations [[Kingdom of Iraq (Mandate administration)|mandate over Iraq]] in 1920 and therefore represented Iraq in its foreign affairs, Mosul belonged to Iraq; on the other hand, the new Turkish republic claimed the province as part of its historic heartland. A League of Nations Commission of Inquiry, with Belgian, Hungarian and Swedish members, was sent to the region in 1924; it found that the people of Mosul did not want to be part of either Turkey or Iraq, but if they had to choose, they would pick Iraq.{{sfn|Scott|1973|p=133}} In 1925, the commission recommended that the region stay part of Iraq, under the condition that the British hold the mandate over Iraq for another 25 years, to ensure the autonomous rights of the [[Kurdish people|Kurdish]] population. The League Council adopted the recommendation and decided on 16 December 1925 to award Mosul to Iraq. Although Turkey had accepted the League of Nations' arbitration in the [[Treaty of Lausanne (1923)]], it rejected the decision, questioning the Council's authority. The matter was referred to the Permanent Court of International Justice, which ruled that, when the Council made a unanimous decision, it must be accepted. Nonetheless, Britain, Iraq and Turkey ratified a separate treaty on 5 June 1926 that mostly followed the decision of the League Council and also assigned Mosul to Iraq. It was agreed that Iraq could still apply for League membership within 25 years and that the mandate would end upon its admission.{{sfn|Northedge|1986|pp=107\u2013108}}{{sfn|Scott|1973|pp=131\u2013135}}\n\n===Vilnius===\n{{Main|\u017beligowski's Mutiny}}\nAfter the First World War, Poland and Lithuania both regained their independence but soon became immersed in territorial disputes.{{sfn|Northedge|1986|p=78}} During the [[Polish\u2013Soviet War]], Lithuania signed the [[Soviet\u2013Lithuanian Peace Treaty|Moscow Peace Treaty]] with the Soviet Union that laid out Lithuania's frontiers. This agreement gave Lithuanians control of the city of [[Vilnius]] ({{lang-lt|Vilnius}}, {{lang-pl|Wilno}}), the old Lithuanian capital, but a city with a majority Polish population.{{sfn|Scott|1973|p=61}} This heightened tension between Lithuania and Poland and led to fears that they would resume the [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian War]], and on 7 October 1920, the League negotiated the [[Suwa\u0142ki Agreement]] establishing a cease-fire and a demarcation line between the two nations.{{sfn|Northedge|1986|p=78}} On 9 October 1920, General [[Lucjan \u017beligowski]], commanding a Polish military force in contravention of the Suwa\u0142ki Agreement, took the city and established the [[Republic of Central Lithuania]].{{sfn|Northedge|1986|p=78}}\n\nAfter a request for assistance from Lithuania, the League Council called for Poland's withdrawal from the area. The Polish government indicated they would comply, but instead reinforced the city with more Polish troops.{{sfn|Scott|1973|p=62}} This prompted the League to decide that the future of Vilnius should be determined by its residents in a plebiscite and that the Polish forces should withdraw and be replaced by an international force organised by the League. The plan was met with resistance in Poland, Lithuania, and the Soviet Union, which opposed any international force in Lithuania. In March 1921, the League abandoned plans for the plebiscite.{{sfn|Scott|1973|p=63}} After unsuccessful proposals by [[Paul Hymans]] to create a federation between Poland and Lithuania, which was intended as a reincarnation of the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth|former union which both Poland and Lithuania]] had once shared before losing its independence, Vilnius and the surrounding area was formally annexed by Poland in March 1922. After Lithuania took over the [[Klaip\u0117da Region]], the [[Conference of Ambassadors|Allied Conference]] set the frontier between Lithuania and Poland, leaving Vilnius within Poland, on 14 March 1923.{{sfn|Northedge|1986|pp=78\u201379}} Lithuanian authorities refused to accept the decision, and officially remained in a state of war with Poland until 1927.{{sfn|Bell|2007|p=29}} It was not until the [[1938 Polish ultimatum to Lithuania|1938 Polish ultimatum]] that Lithuania restored diplomatic relations with Poland and thus ''de facto'' accepted the borders.{{sfn|Crampton|1996|p=93}}\n\n===Colombia and Peru===\n{{Main|Colombia\u2013Peru War|Leticia dispute}}\nThere were several border conflicts between [[Colombia]] and [[Peru]] in the early part of the 20th century, and in 1922, their governments signed the [[Salom\u00f3n-Lozano Treaty]] in an attempt to resolve them.{{sfn|Osmanczyk|Mango|2002|p=1314}} As part of this treaty, the border town of [[Leticia, Amazonas|Leticia]] and its surrounding area was ceded from Peru to Colombia, giving Colombia access to the [[Amazon River]].{{sfn|Scott|1973|p=249}} On 1 September 1932, business leaders from Peruvian rubber and sugar industries who had lost land, as a result, organised an armed takeover of Leticia.{{sfn|Bethell|1991|pp=414\u2013415}} At first, the [[Peruvian government]] did not recognise the military takeover, but [[President of Peru]] [[Luis Miguel S\u00e1nchez Cerro|Luis S\u00e1nchez Cerro]] decided to resist a Colombian re-occupation. The [[Peruvian Army]] occupied Leticia, leading to an armed conflict between the two nations.{{sfn|Scott|1973|p=250}} After months of diplomatic negotiations, the governments accepted mediation by the League of Nations, and their representatives presented their cases before the Council. A provisional peace agreement, signed by both parties in May 1933, provided for the League to assume control of the disputed territory while bilateral negotiations proceeded.{{sfn|Scott|1973|p=251}} In May 1934, a final peace agreement was signed, resulting in the return of Leticia to Colombia, a formal apology from Peru for the 1932 invasion, demilitarisation of the area around Leticia, free navigation on the Amazon and [[Putumayo River]]s, and a pledge of [[non-aggression pact|non-aggression]].<ref>{{cite book|title=The verdict of the League|year=1934|editor=Hudson, Manley|publisher=World Peace Foundation|pages=1\u201313}}</ref>\n\n===Saar===\n[[Saar (League of Nations)|Saar]] was a province formed from parts of Prussia and the [[Palatinate region|Rhenish Palatinate]] and placed under League control by the Treaty of Versailles. A plebiscite was to be held after fifteen years of League rule to determine whether the province should belong to Germany or France. When the referendum was held in 1935, 90.3 per cent of voters supported becoming part of Germany, which was quickly approved by the League Council.{{sfn|Northedge|1986|pp=72\u201373}}{{sfn|Churchill|1986|p=98}}\n\n==Other conflicts==\nIn addition to territorial disputes, the League also tried to intervene in other conflicts between and within nations. Among its successes were its fight against the international trade in opium and sexual slavery, and its work to alleviate the plight of refugees, particularly in Turkey in the period up to 1926. One of its innovations in this latter area was the 1922 introduction of the [[Nansen passport]], which was the first internationally recognised identity card for stateless refugees.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unog.ch/80256EE60057D930/%28httpPages%29/03F1E1DD124D3276C1256F32002EE3AB?OpenDocument|accessdate=15 September 2011|title=The United Nations in the Heart of Europe|publisher=United Nations|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111110132257/http://www.unog.ch/80256EE60057D930/(httpPages)/03F1E1DD124D3276C1256F32002EE3AB?OpenDocument|archive-date=10 November 2011|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Greece and Bulgaria===\n{{Main|Incident at Petrich}}\nAfter an incident involving sentries on the Greek-Bulgarian border in October 1925, fighting began between the two countries.{{sfn|Northedge|1986|p=112}} Three days after the initial incident, Greek troops invaded Bulgaria.

They renamed the area [[Manchukuo]], and on 9 March 1932 set up a puppet government, with [[Pu Yi]], the former emperor of China, as its executive head.{{sfn|Northedge|1986|p=139}} This new entity was recognised only by the governments of Italy, Spain and Nazi Germany; the rest of the world still considered Manchuria legally part of China.\n\nThe League of Nations sent observers. The [[Lytton Report]] appeared a year later (October 1932). It declared Japan to be the aggressor and demanded Manchuria be returned to China.  The report passed 42\u20131 in the Assembly in 1933 (only Japan voting against), but instead of removing its troops from China, Japan withdrew from the League.{{sfn|Northedge|1986|pp=156\u2013161}} In the end,  as British historian [[Charles Mowat]] argued, collective security was dead:\n:The League and the ideas of collective security and the rule of law were defeated; partly because of indifference and of sympathy with the aggressor, but partly because the League powers were unprepared, preoccupied with other matters, and too slow to perceive the scale of Japanese ambitions.<ref>Charles Loch Mowat, ''Britain between the Wars 1918\u20131940'' (1955) p. 420.</ref>\n\n===Chaco War===\n{{Main|Chaco War}}\nThe League failed to prevent the 1932 war between [[Bolivia]] and [[Paraguay]] over the arid [[Gran Chaco]] region. Although the region was sparsely populated, it contained the [[Paraguay River]], which would have given either landlocked country access to the Atlantic Ocean,{{sfn|Scott|1973|pp=242\u2013243}} and there was also speculation, later proved incorrect, that the Chaco would be a rich source of petroleum.{{sfn|Levy|2001|pp=21\u201322}} Border skirmishes throughout the late 1920s culminated in an all-out war in 1932 when the Bolivian army attacked the Paraguayans at Fort Carlos Antonio L\u00f3pez at [[Lake Pitiantuta]].{{sfn|Bethell|1991|p=495}} Paraguay appealed to the League of Nations, but the League did not take action when the [[Pan-American Conference]] offered to mediate instead. The war was a disaster for both sides, causing 57,000 casualties for Bolivia, whose population was around three million, and 36,000 dead for Paraguay, whose population was approximately one million.{{sfn|Scott|1973|p=248}} It also brought both countries to the brink of economic disaster.

The French were reluctant to reduce their armaments without a guarantee of military help if they were attacked; Poland and [[Czechoslovakia]] felt vulnerable to attack from the west and wanted the League's response to aggression against its members to be strengthened before they disarmed.{{sfn|Henig|1973|p=173}} Without this guarantee, they would not reduce armaments because they felt the risk of attack from Germany was too great. Fear of attack increased as Germany regained its strength after the First World War, especially after Adolf Hitler gained power and became [[Adolf Hitler's rise to power|German Chancellor in 1933]]. In particular, Germany's attempts to overturn the Treaty of Versailles and the reconstruction of the German military made France increasingly unwilling to disarm.{{sfn|Northedge|1986|p=114}}\n\nThe [[World Disarmament Conference]] was convened by the League of Nations in Geneva in 1932, with representatives from 60 states.

There were a variety of reasons for this failure, many connected to general weaknesses within the organisation. Additionally, the power of the League was limited by the United States' refusal to join.{{sfn|Northedge|1986|pp=276\u2013278}}\n\n===Origins and structure===\nThe origins of the League as an organisation created by the Allied powers as part of the peace settlement to end the First World War led to it being viewed as a \"League of Victors\".{{sfn|Gorodetsky|1994|p=26}}{{sfn|Raffo|1974|p=1}} The League's neutrality tended to manifest itself as indecision. It required a unanimous vote of nine, later fifteen, Council members to enact a resolution; hence, conclusive and effective action was difficult, if not impossible. It was also slow in coming to its decisions, as certain ones required the unanimous consent of the entire Assembly. This problem mainly stemmed from the fact that the primary members of the League of Nations were not willing to accept the possibility of their fate being decided by other countries, and by enforcing unanimous voting had effectively given themselves veto power.<ref>{{cite book|pages=226\u2013227|author=Birn, Donald S|publisher=Clarendon Press|year=1981|title=The League of Nations Union|isbn=978-0-19-822650-5}}</ref>{{sfn|Northedge|1986|pp=279\u2013282, 288\u2013292}}\n\n===Global representation===\nRepresentation at the League was often a problem. Though it was intended to encompass all nations, many never joined, or their period of membership was short. The most conspicuous absentee was the United States. President Woodrow Wilson had been a driving force behind the League's formation and strongly influenced the form it took, but the US Senate voted not to join on 19 November 1919.{{sfn|Knock|1995|p=263}} [[Ruth Henig, Baroness Henig|Ruth Henig]] has suggested that, had the United States become a member, it would have also provided support to France and Britain, possibly making France feel more secure, and so encouraging France and Britain to co-operate more fully regarding Germany, thus making the rise to power of the [[Nazi Party]] less likely.{{sfn|Henig|1973|p=175}} Conversely, Henig acknowledges that if the US had been a member, its reluctance to engage in war with European states or to enact economic sanctions might have hampered the ability of the League to deal with [[international incident]]s.{{sfn|Henig|1973|p=175}} The structure of the [[Federal government of the United States|US federal government]] might also have made its membership problematic, as its representatives at the League could not have made decisions on behalf of the [[Executive (government)|executive branch]] without having the prior approval of the [[United States Congress|legislative branch]].{{sfn|Henig|1973|p=176}}\n\nIn January 1920, when the League was born, Germany was not permitted to join because it was seen as having been the aggressor in the First World War. [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Soviet Russia]] was also initially excluded because Communist regimes were not welcomed and membership would have been initially dubious due to the [[Russian Civil War]] in which both sides claimed to be the legitimate government of the country. The League was further weakened when major powers left in the 1930s. Japan began as a permanent member of the Council since the country was an Allied Power in the First World War, but withdrew in 1933 after the League voiced opposition to its occupation of Manchuria.{{sfn|McDonough|1997|p=62}} Italy began as a permanent member of the Council but withdrew in 1937 after roughly a year following the end of the [[Second Italo-Ethiopian War]]. Spain also began as a permanent member of the Council, but withdrew in 1939 after the [[Spanish Civil War]] ended in a victory for the Nationalists. The League had accepted Germany, also as a permanent member of the Council, in 1926, deeming it a \"peace-loving country\", but Adolf Hitler pulled Germany out when he came to power in 1933.{{sfn|McDonough|1997|p=69}}\n\n===Collective security===\nAnother important weakness grew from the contradiction between the idea of [[collective security]] that formed the basis of the League and [[international relations]] between individual states.{{sfn|Northedge|1986|p=253}} The League's collective security system required nations to act, if necessary, against states they considered friendly, and in a way that might endanger their [[national interest]]s, to support states for which they had no normal affinity.{{sfn|Northedge|1986|p=253}} This weakness was exposed during the [[Abyssinia Crisis]], when Britain and France had to balance maintaining the security they had attempted to create for themselves in Europe \"to defend against the enemies of internal order\",{{sfn|Northedge|1986|p=254}} in which Italy's support played a pivotal role, with their obligations to Abyssinia as a member of the League.{{sfn|Northedge|1986|pp=253\u2013254}}\n\nOn 23 June 1936, in the wake of the collapse of League efforts to restrain Italy's war against Abyssinia, the British Prime Minister, [[Stanley Baldwin]], told the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] that collective security had {{quote|failed ultimately because of the reluctance of nearly all the nations in Europe to proceed to what I might call military sanctions ... The real reason, or the main reason, was that we discovered in the process of weeks that there was no country except the aggressor country which was ready for war ... [I]f collective action is to be a reality and not merely a thing to be talked about, it means not only that every country is to be ready for war; but must be ready to go to war at once. That is a terrible thing, but it is an essential part of collective security.<ref name = \"events\" />}}\n\nUltimately, Britain and France both abandoned the concept of collective security in favour of [[appeasement]] in the face of growing German militarism under Hitler.{{sfn|McDonough|1997|p=74}}\nIn this context, the League of Nations was also the institution where the first international debate on terrorism took place following the 1934 assassination of [[King Alexander I of Yugoslavia]] in [[Marseille]], [[France]], showing its conspiratorial features, many of which are detectable in the discourse of terrorism among states after [[9/11]].<ref>Ditrych, Ondrej. '' 'International Terrorism' as Conspiracy: Debating Terrorism in the League of Nations''. [[Historical Social Research]] Vol. 38, 1 (2013).</ref>\n\nAmerican diplomatic historian [[Samuel Flagg Bemis]] originally supported the League,  but after two decades changed his mind:\n:The League of Nations has been a disappointing failure.... It has been a failure, not because the United States did not join it; but because the great powers have been unwilling to apply sanctions except where it suited their individual national interests to do so, and because Democracy, on which the original concepts of the League rested for support, has collapsed over half the world.<ref>Quoted in Jerald A. Combs, 'American diplomatic history: two centuries of changing interpretations (1983) p 158.</ref>\n\n===Pacifism and disarmament===\nThe League of Nations lacked an armed force of its own and depended on the Great Powers to enforce its resolutions, which they were very unwilling to do.{{sfn|McDonough|1997|pp=54\u20135}} Its two most important members, Britain and France, were reluctant to use sanctions and even more reluctant to resort to military action on behalf of the League. Immediately after the First World War, [[pacifism]] became a strong force among both the people and governments of the two countries. The [[Conservative Party (UK)|British Conservatives]] were especially tepid to the League and preferred, when in government, to negotiate treaties without the involvement of that organisation.{{sfn|Northedge|1986|pp=238\u2013240}} Moreover, the League's advocacy of disarmament for Britain, France, and its other members, while at the same time advocating collective security, meant that the League was depriving itself of the only forceful means by which it could uphold its authority.{{sfn|Northedge|1986|pp=134\u2013135}}\n\nWhen the British cabinet discussed the concept of the League during the First World War, [[Maurice Hankey, 1st Baron Hankey|Maurice Hankey]], the [[Cabinet Secretary]], circulated a memorandum on the subject. He started by saying, \"Generally it appears to me that any such scheme is dangerous to us because it will create a sense of security which is wholly fictitious\".{{sfn|Barnett|1972|p=245}} He attacked the British pre-war faith in the sanctity of treaties as delusional and concluded by claiming:\n\n{{quote|It [a League of Nations] will only result in failure and the longer that failure is postponed the more certain it is that this country will have been lulled to sleep. It will put a very strong lever into the hands of the well-meaning idealists who are to be found in almost every Government, who deprecate expenditure on armaments, and, in the course of time, it will almost certainly result in this country being caught at a disadvantage.{{sfn|Barnett|1972|p=245}}}}\n\nThe Foreign Office civil servant Sir [[Eyre Crowe]] also wrote a memorandum to the British cabinet claiming that \"a solemn league and covenant\" would just be \"a treaty, like other treaties\". \"What is there to ensure that it will not, like other treaties, be broken?\" Crowe went on to express scepticism of the planned \"pledge of common action\" against aggressors because he believed the actions of individual states would still be determined by national interests and the balance of power. He also criticised the proposal for League economic sanctions because it would be ineffectual and that \"It is all a question of real military preponderance\". Universal disarmament was a practical impossibility, Crowe warned.{{sfn|Barnett|1972|p=245}}\n\n==Demise and legacy==\n[[File:18-IV-1946.png|right|thumb|500px|World map showing [[member states of the League of Nations]] (in green and red) on 18 April 1946, when the League of Nations ceased to exist.]][[File:Humanit\u00e9s Num\u00e9riques.JPG|thumb|right|League of Nations archives, Geneva.<ref>League of Nations archives, United Nations Office in Geneva.

Current consensus views that, even though the League failed to achieve its ultimate goal of world peace, it did manage to build new roads towards expanding the [[rule of law]] across the globe; strengthened the concept of [[collective security]], giving a voice to smaller nations; helped to raise awareness to problems like [[epidemics]], [[slavery]], [[child labour]], colonial tyranny, [[refugee|refugee crises]] and general working conditions through its numerous commissions and committees; and paved the way for new forms of statehood, as the [[mandate system]] put the colonial powers under international observation.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Pedersen|first1=Susan|title=Back to the League of Nations|journal=The American Historical Review|volume=112|issue=4|pages=1091\u20131117|date=October 2007|publisher=American Historical Review|jstor=40008445|doi=10.1086/ahr.112.4.1091}}</ref>\n\nProfessor [[David M.

Kabir abides by the traditional code of conduct and Zara applies the teachings of Allah in a practical way. Kabir and Zara take us on a journey of their world where they are grappling with issues like [[Triple Talaq]]. They get married due to an argument but gradually fall in love.

When an argument about [[Triple Talaq]] between Zara and Kabir becomes viral on the internet, they are forced to marry each other.\n\nGradually after marriage, Zara realizes her love for the still hesitant Kabir. Rukhsaar has been in love with him from a young age and tries to split them up, who brings Miraj to create differences between Zara and Kabir though he goes rogue out to harm everyone in the family.\n\nRukhsaar calls Nilofer to pose as Miraj's sister and instructs her to protect the family from Miraj except for Zara, but is then married off to Hamdaan Alghazi and leaves for [[Dubai]]. Miraj buys out and kills Nilofer. A misunderstanding leads to Kabir divorcing Zara using the Triple Talaq practice. \n\nIt is revealed this was not a part of their nuptials and Zara refuses to accept. Miraj tells Zara that he wants her and can go to any extent, whereas she tries to have Rukhsaar return to expose Miraj's true intentions but is unable to reach her. Miraj makes his way into the local [[Shariah Board]] and turns out to be a diamond smuggler laundering money. \n\nMiraj is arrested and Kabir's dream project loses its funding. Miraj's connection to Rukhsaar is revealed before he swears revenge on Zara and Kabir who confess their love. The family arrange their remarriage. Prior to it, Kabir leaves for Dubai to save Rukhsaar from implication in Hamdaan's death and ends up marrying her. He weds Zara on his return. When Zara finds out, she is heartbroken but decides to stay.\n\nRukhsaar meets with an accident and loses her memory. Kabir takes her responsibility upsetting Zara. Wanting Kabir to earn independently, Zara moves to outhouse. Tabassum visits with Azhar who appreciates Zara's modern thinking. Shahbaz is in debt and decides to sell the house but Kashan swindles him and takes ownership of the house.\n\nKabir realises Shahbaz's faults and sees Zara's well-intended suggestion to him to earn independently. Rukhsaar is sent to a hospital for treatment; Zeenat and Kashan team up to have Alina marry local don Salamat's son Samir. Zara and Kabir thwart their plan with help of army officer Amir, who and Alina fall in love and get married. Salamat tries to kill Kabir and Zara. Kabir becomes the head priest. \n\nZeenat is irked; Salamat threatens to kill Rukhsaar, amd Irfan suggests Zara to become the vice priest. Heer's case is brought before the Sharia Board where she wants to go to Delhi to study but in vain amid her reluctant father. Zara takes the case against Kabir and wins. Suraiya moves to Lucknow with Rizwan and plans to have him replace Kabir as Board Head with Zeenat's help. Salamat bribes Khalid on Zeenat's request.\n\nRizwan exposes Zeenat's actions as soon as he joins the Board and has her declared mentally unsound. She vows revenge on Rizwan who starts poisoning Irfan slowly. Bilal and Kausar's case comes to the Board; Rizwan plans to create a rift between Zara and Kabir, who tells her that Kausar was betrothed to Kashan and eloped on wedding before Kashan married Zeenat who was indebted to Kausar's family. \n\nEveryone in the family request Zara to disagree to the case but she and Kabir decide. Entire city protests against them and Kabir too turns against Zara who is about to drop the case before Kausar's suicide attempt changes her mind. Zara leaves Ahmads and Shahbaz plans her murder. In the Sharia Board, she wins. Kabir in an accident is orchestrated by Rizwan; Zara is shot by a hitman hired by Shahbaz. The two collapse together.\n\n===One year later===\n\nZara and Kabir live separately. While Zara resides with Amina, Azra and Nusu in [[Mumbai]], Kabir lives with his family in [[Lucknow]]. Zara and Kabir have applied for a divorce wanting to free each other, but he finds Zara's hospital reports and is shocked to discover that Zara was in a coma after being shot. Alina tries to bring them together but they see through her plan.\n\nZara discovers that Kabir became a writer after publishing a book on their relationship and moves to Lucknow with Azra. They finally decide to give their relationship another chance angering Zeenat and Shahbaz. Shahbaz again tries to have her killed but Kabir saves her every time. \n\nThe Ahmads rejoice at the couple's reunion prospect and Kabir insults Irfan, asking the Qazi to beg to him to take Zara back. Upset, Zara breaks up with Kabir, while Irfan has a heart attack. Ayesha is heartbroken and asks him to leave the house. He starts living in the mosque.\n\n=== One month later ===\n\nZara learns about Ayesha's illness from Kashan and decides to go back only for Ayesha's sake. She decides to reunite Ayesha and Kabir on [[Eid al-Fitr|Eid]]. Shahbaz and Zeenat worry that Zara and Kabir might get back together so Shahbaz constantly provokes Kabir against Zara.

Prior to it, Kabir leaves for Dubai to save Rukhsaar from implication in Hamdaan's death and ends up marrying her. He weds Zara on his return. When Zara finds out, she is heartbroken but decides to stay.\n\nRukhsaar meets with an accident and loses her memory. Kabir takes her responsibility upsetting Zara. Wanting Kabir to earn independently, Zara moves to outhouse. Tabassum visits with Azhar who appreciates Zara's modern thinking.

Our next primetime fiction offering belongs to the Muslim social drama space that we had, ourselves, pioneered with Qubool Hai, a show that enjoyed an immensely successful run of two seasons. Ishq Subhan Allah asks viewers to pause and reflect on the true interpretation of religion in our daily lives.
