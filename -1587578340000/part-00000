The album was released on 7 November 1989 in the US by [[Atlantic Records]] and on 24 November 1989 in the UK by [[Virgin Records]]. \n\nAfter [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]] took a break in activity in 1987 Collins resumed his solo career, first starring in the film ''[[Buster (film)|Buster]]'' followed by writing and recording ''...But Seriously''. The album has a more serious tone than his previous album, ''[[No Jacket Required]]'', and several songs have lyrics concerning socio-economic and political issues.\n\n''...But Seriously'' was a huge commercial success worldwide, reaching No. 1 in the UK and the US for 15 and 4 non-consecutive weeks, respectively. It was the best selling album of 1990 in the UK, eventually selling 2.75 million copies there and 4 million in the US. The lead single \"[[Another Day in Paradise]]\" won a [[Grammy Award]] for [[Grammy Award for Record of the Year#Recipients|Record of the Year]]. Collins supported the album with the [[Seriously, Live! World Tour]] in 1990. In 2016, the album was remastered with additional studio, live, and demo tracks, and updated artwork.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://theseconddisc.com/2016/04/28/hang-long-enough-seriously-revised-going-back-complete-phil-collins-reissue-campaign/ |title=Hang In Long Enough: \"\u2026But Seriously,\" Revised \"Going Back\" Complete Phil Collins Reissue Campaign|accessdate=29 April 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.genesis-news.com/c-Phil-Collins-Take-A-Look-At-Me-Now-the-reissues-campaign-s596.html |title=Phil Collins \u2013 Take A Look At Me Now|publisher=Genesis News|accessdate=29 April 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Background==\nIn July 1987, Collins finished touring commitments with the band [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]] and resumed his solo career. He had scored a series of hit singles with his previous solo album ''[[No Jacket Required]]'' (1985) and with Genesis on ''[[Invisible Touch]]'' (1986), and recognised this period as \"severe danger of overkill\" due to the high amount of radio airplay the songs had received.<ref name=TS90>{{cite newspaper|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/48821501/|title=Collins' LP reflects individual, romantic concerns|date=16 February 1990|newspaper=The Sentinel|page=D5|via=[[Newspapers.com]]|accessdate=16 April 2020}}</ref> To combat this, Collins took a year out solely from music and accepted a lead role in ''[[Buster (film)|Buster]]'' (1988), a romantic comedy film based on the [[Great Train Robbery (1963)|Great Train Robbery]]. Collins recorded \"[[Two Hearts]]\" and \"[[A Groovy Kind of Love]]\" for [[Buster (soundtrack)|the soundtrack]], which led to his belief that people thought his songs had become \"Very, very light. That wasn't where I was coming from.\"<ref name=TS90/> When he started work on his next solo album, Collins deliberately shifted styles by addressing more serious issues in his lyrics and songs with greater depth than the dance-oriented approach for ''No Jacket Required''.<ref name=TS90/>\n\n==Production==\n''...But Seriously'' was recorded between April and October 1989 at [[The Farm (recording studio)|The Farm]] in [[Chiddingfold]], Surrey and [[A&M Studios]] in [[Los Angeles]], California. It was produced by Collins and [[Hugh Padgham]], who had worked on his previous solo albums and with Genesis throughout the decade. The album saw Collins use a live drum kit instead of ''No Jacket Required'' which had utilised greater use of a [[drum machine]]. He also prominently used keyboards and electric piano and fewer synthesisers.\n\nCollins experienced difficulty when it came to naming the album due to the fact that it would always be known as the one chosen. The initial title was ''Serious Business'', before Collins decided against the potential connotations of business or corporations that it may have on the public.<ref name=TWR00>{{cite web|url=http://www.twronline.net/issues/twr41/twr41_pc01.htm|title=\"Phil Collins... profiled\" - Phil talks about the \"...But Seriously\" album|first=Alan|last=Hewitt|date=February 2000|via=The Waiting Room Online|accessdate=20 April 2020}}</ref> As the title suggests, the album is a change of pace from the lighter tone of Collins's previous work. Collins expanded his focus to the exploration of socio-economic and political themes. There is emotional turmoil underneath the polished studio production and many of the songs are unambiguous and unveiled in their melancholy. While incorporating political themes, ''...But Seriously'' does not abandon the theme of relationships. But unlike some of his earlier work, Collins takes a more mature and reflective approach when looking at the relationships in his life.\n\nAs with his previous albums Collins wrote the sleeve notes by hand because \"that's all part of the personal statement\"; the exception being ''No Jacket Required''.<ref name=Q90/> He wrote the text on the \"Another Day in Paradise\" single on the inbound from the album's European press trip in November 1989.<ref name=Q90/>\n\n==Songs==\n\"[[That's Just the Way It Is]]\" is an anti-war song about [[The Troubles]] in Northern Ireland and features [[David Crosby]] on backing vocals. The B-side to the single was \"Broadway Chorus\", the demo version of \"[[Something Happened on the Way to Heaven]]\".\n\n\"[[Do You Remember? (Phil Collins song)|Do You Remember?]]\" has lyrics from the perspective of a man whose relationship is failing due to his lover's neglect. It features [[Stephen Bishop (singer)|Stephen Bishop]] on backing vocals.\n\n\"[[Something Happened on the Way to Heaven]]\" was written by Collins and his longtime touring guitarist [[Daryl Stuermer]]. \n\n\"Colours\" is a politically-themed song condemning [[apartheid in South Africa]] and displays a [[progressive rock]] influence.\n\n\"[[I Wish It Would Rain Down]]\" is a [[Gospel music|gospel]]-influenced track that Collins said is the closest he had come to writing a blues song. It features [[Eric Clapton]] on lead guitar.\n\n\"[[Another Day in Paradise]]\" addresses the issue of [[homelessness]].<ref name=Dean>{{cite book|title=Rock N' Roll Gold Rush|last=Dean|first=Maury|authorlink=Maury Dean|year=2003|publisher=Algora|isbn=0-87586-207-1|page=60}}</ref> Its working title was \"Homeless\".<ref name=TWR00/> Among the inspirational sources for the song was Collins's stay in Washington, D.C. while on tour and encountered homeless people by [[Capitol Hill]] trying to keep warm and the contradiction of the [[White House]] being so close by.<ref name=TWR00/>\n\nCollins wrote that \"All of My Life\" is about his relationship with his late father and his regrets to not have more connection with him during his life.\n\nThe album also features a sole instrumental track, \"Saturday Night and Sunday Morning\", which recalls the jazz-influenced instrumentals featured on his first two albums, ''[[Face Value (album)|Face Value]]'' and ''[[Hello, I Must Be Going! (album)|Hello, I Must Be Going]]''.\n\"Father to Son\" is about Collins's relationship with his eldest son, [[Simon Collins|Simon]].\n\n===Additional material===\nCollins recorded three other songs that were released as B-sides to the album's singles:\n\n#\"That's How I Feel\"\n#\"You've Been in Love (That Little Bit Too Long)\"\n#\"Around the World in 80 Presets\"\n\n==Release and singles==\n''...But Seriously'' was released on 6 November 1989 in the US by [[Atlantic Records]] and on 20 November 1989 in the UK by [[Virgin Records]].<ref name=bpi>{{cite web|url=http://i.imgur.com/rZzqohG.jpg|title=BPI > Certified Awards > Search results for Phil Collins (page 1)|publisher=[[British Phonographic Industry]]|accessdate=16 February 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe album spawned six singles released between October 1989 and November 1990. \n\n*\"Another Day in Paradise\" \u2013 US #1, UK #2 (1989)<ref name=Dean />\n*\"I Wish It Would Rain Down\" \u2013 US #3, UK #7 (1990)\n*\"Something Happened on the Way to Heaven\" \u2013 US #4, UK #15 (1990)\n*\"Do You Remember?\" \u2013 US #4 (1990)\n* \"That's Just The Way It Is\" \u2013 UK #26 (1990)\n*\"Hang in Long Enough\" \u2013 US #23, UK #34 (1990)\n\nIn Canada, \"Another Day in Paradise\", \"I Wish It Would Rain Down\", \"Do You Remember?\", and \"Something Happened on the Way to Heaven\" reached No. 1.\n\n==Tour==\nIn support of the album, Collins' embarked on a worldwide tour, called [[Seriously, Live!

After [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]] took a break in activity in 1987 Collins resumed his solo career, first starring in the film ''[[Buster (film)|Buster]]'' followed by writing and recording ''...But Seriously''. The album has a more serious tone than his previous album, ''[[No Jacket Required]]'', and several songs have lyrics concerning socio-economic and political issues.\n\n''...But Seriously'' was a huge commercial success worldwide, reaching No. 1 in the UK and the US for 15 and 4 non-consecutive weeks, respectively. It was the best selling album of 1990 in the UK, eventually selling 2.75 million copies there and 4 million in the US. The lead single \"[[Another Day in Paradise]]\" won a [[Grammy Award]] for [[Grammy Award for Record of the Year#Recipients|Record of the Year]]. Collins supported the album with the [[Seriously, Live! World Tour]] in 1990. In 2016, the album was remastered with additional studio, live, and demo tracks, and updated artwork.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://theseconddisc.com/2016/04/28/hang-long-enough-seriously-revised-going-back-complete-phil-collins-reissue-campaign/ |title=Hang In Long Enough: \"\u2026But Seriously,\" Revised \"Going Back\" Complete Phil Collins Reissue Campaign|accessdate=29 April 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.genesis-news.com/c-Phil-Collins-Take-A-Look-At-Me-Now-the-reissues-campaign-s596.html |title=Phil Collins \u2013 Take A Look At Me Now|publisher=Genesis News|accessdate=29 April 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Background==\nIn July 1987, Collins finished touring commitments with the band [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]] and resumed his solo career. He had scored a series of hit singles with his previous solo album ''[[No Jacket Required]]'' (1985) and with Genesis on ''[[Invisible Touch]]'' (1986), and recognised this period as \"severe danger of overkill\" due to the high amount of radio airplay the songs had received.<ref name=TS90>{{cite newspaper|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/48821501/|title=Collins' LP reflects individual, romantic concerns|date=16 February 1990|newspaper=The Sentinel|page=D5|via=[[Newspapers.com]]|accessdate=16 April 2020}}</ref> To combat this, Collins took a year out solely from music and accepted a lead role in ''[[Buster (film)|Buster]]'' (1988), a romantic comedy film based on the [[Great Train Robbery (1963)|Great Train Robbery]]. Collins recorded \"[[Two Hearts]]\" and \"[[A Groovy Kind of Love]]\" for [[Buster (soundtrack)|the soundtrack]], which led to his belief that people thought his songs had become \"Very, very light. That wasn't where I was coming from.\"<ref name=TS90/> When he started work on his next solo album, Collins deliberately shifted styles by addressing more serious issues in his lyrics and songs with greater depth than the dance-oriented approach for ''No Jacket Required''.<ref name=TS90/>\n\n==Production==\n''...But Seriously'' was recorded between April and October 1989 at [[The Farm (recording studio)|The Farm]] in [[Chiddingfold]], Surrey and [[A&M Studios]] in [[Los Angeles]], California. It was produced by Collins and [[Hugh Padgham]], who had worked on his previous solo albums and with Genesis throughout the decade. The album saw Collins use a live drum kit instead of ''No Jacket Required'' which had utilised greater use of a [[drum machine]]. He also prominently used keyboards and electric piano and fewer synthesisers.\n\nCollins experienced difficulty when it came to naming the album due to the fact that it would always be known as the one chosen. The initial title was ''Serious Business'', before Collins decided against the potential connotations of business or corporations that it may have on the public.<ref name=TWR00>{{cite web|url=http://www.twronline.net/issues/twr41/twr41_pc01.htm|title=\"Phil Collins... profiled\" - Phil talks about the \"...But Seriously\" album|first=Alan|last=Hewitt|date=February 2000|via=The Waiting Room Online|accessdate=20 April 2020}}</ref> As the title suggests, the album is a change of pace from the lighter tone of Collins's previous work. Collins expanded his focus to the exploration of socio-economic and political themes. There is emotional turmoil underneath the polished studio production and many of the songs are unambiguous and unveiled in their melancholy. While incorporating political themes, ''...But Seriously'' does not abandon the theme of relationships. But unlike some of his earlier work, Collins takes a more mature and reflective approach when looking at the relationships in his life.\n\nAs with his previous albums Collins wrote the sleeve notes by hand because \"that's all part of the personal statement\"; the exception being ''No Jacket Required''.<ref name=Q90/> He wrote the text on the \"Another Day in Paradise\" single on the inbound from the album's European press trip in November 1989.<ref name=Q90/>\n\n==Songs==\n\"[[That's Just the Way It Is]]\" is an anti-war song about [[The Troubles]] in Northern Ireland and features [[David Crosby]] on backing vocals. The B-side to the single was \"Broadway Chorus\", the demo version of \"[[Something Happened on the Way to Heaven]]\".\n\n\"[[Do You Remember? (Phil Collins song)|Do You Remember?]]\" has lyrics from the perspective of a man whose relationship is failing due to his lover's neglect. It features [[Stephen Bishop (singer)|Stephen Bishop]] on backing vocals.\n\n\"[[Something Happened on the Way to Heaven]]\" was written by Collins and his longtime touring guitarist [[Daryl Stuermer]]. \n\n\"Colours\" is a politically-themed song condemning [[apartheid in South Africa]] and displays a [[progressive rock]] influence.\n\n\"[[I Wish It Would Rain Down]]\" is a [[Gospel music|gospel]]-influenced track that Collins said is the closest he had come to writing a blues song. It features [[Eric Clapton]] on lead guitar.\n\n\"[[Another Day in Paradise]]\" addresses the issue of [[homelessness]].<ref name=Dean>{{cite book|title=Rock N' Roll Gold Rush|last=Dean|first=Maury|authorlink=Maury Dean|year=2003|publisher=Algora|isbn=0-87586-207-1|page=60}}</ref> Its working title was \"Homeless\".<ref name=TWR00/> Among the inspirational sources for the song was Collins's stay in Washington, D.C. while on tour and encountered homeless people by [[Capitol Hill]] trying to keep warm and the contradiction of the [[White House]] being so close by.<ref name=TWR00/>\n\nCollins wrote that \"All of My Life\" is about his relationship with his late father and his regrets to not have more connection with him during his life.\n\nThe album also features a sole instrumental track, \"Saturday Night and Sunday Morning\", which recalls the jazz-influenced instrumentals featured on his first two albums, ''[[Face Value (album)|Face Value]]'' and ''[[Hello, I Must Be Going! (album)|Hello, I Must Be Going]]''.\n\"Father to Son\" is about Collins's relationship with his eldest son, [[Simon Collins|Simon]].\n\n===Additional material===\nCollins recorded three other songs that were released as B-sides to the album's singles:\n\n#\"That's How I Feel\"\n#\"You've Been in Love (That Little Bit Too Long)\"\n#\"Around the World in 80 Presets\"\n\n==Release and singles==\n''...But Seriously'' was released on 6 November 1989 in the US by [[Atlantic Records]] and on 20 November 1989 in the UK by [[Virgin Records]].<ref name=bpi>{{cite web|url=http://i.imgur.com/rZzqohG.jpg|title=BPI > Certified Awards > Search results for Phil Collins (page 1)|publisher=[[British Phonographic Industry]]|accessdate=16 February 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe album spawned six singles released between October 1989 and November 1990. \n\n*\"Another Day in Paradise\" \u2013 US #1, UK #2 (1989)<ref name=Dean />\n*\"I Wish It Would Rain Down\" \u2013 US #3, UK #7 (1990)\n*\"Something Happened on the Way to Heaven\" \u2013 US #4, UK #15 (1990)\n*\"Do You Remember?\" \u2013 US #4 (1990)\n* \"That's Just The Way It Is\" \u2013 UK #26 (1990)\n*\"Hang in Long Enough\" \u2013 US #23, UK #34 (1990)\n\nIn Canada, \"Another Day in Paradise\", \"I Wish It Would Rain Down\", \"Do You Remember?\", and \"Something Happened on the Way to Heaven\" reached No. 1.\n\n==Tour==\nIn support of the album, Collins' embarked on a worldwide tour, called [[Seriously, Live!

The world's first sex shop was opened in 1962 by [[Beate Uhse AG]] in [[Flensburg]], [[West Germany]], and sex shops can now be found in many countries and online. Sex shops are part of the [[sex industry]]. In most jurisdictions, sex shops are regulated by law, with access not legally permitted to [[child|minors]], the age depending on local law. Some jurisdictions prohibit sex shops and the merchandise they sell. In some jurisdictions that permit it, they may also show pornographic movies in [[Adult video arcade|private video booths]], or have private [[striptease]] or [[peep show]]s.

A warning sign must be clearly shown at the entrance to the store, and no sex articles (for example, pornography or sex toys) should be visible from the street. However, lingerie, non-offensive covers of adult material, etc. may be shown depending on the licence conditions of the local authority. The [[Video Recordings Act 1984]] introduced the [[R18 (British Board of Film Classification)|R18-rated]] classification for videos that are only available in licensed sex shops. No customer can be under 18 years old.\n\nIn London, there are few boroughs that have licensed sex shops.

Into the 1980s, nearly all American sex shops were oriented to an almost entirely male clientele.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} Many included [[adult video arcade]]s, and nearly all were designed so that their customers could not be seen from the street: they lacked windows, and the doors often involved an L-shaped turn so that people on the street could not see in.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} In addition, during the late 1980s and early 1990s, stores that also had theaters or arcades were sometimes closed by government order, citing the spread of AIDS as the motive.<ref>{{cite news|author=Huntly Collins |url=http://articles.philly.com/1992-07-30/news/26028281_1_video-booths-bookstores-aids-virus |title=Pa.

The stadium would have served as home field until a permanent facility could be built. It had come up in the city's talks to lure the former [[Montreal Expos]], [[Florida Marlins]], and Oakland Athletics. However, the park would have needed considerable expansion, particularly in seating capacity, in order to host a team. The substantial costs which would be incurred in expansion and construction of a new stadium, as well as MLB concerns over Las Vegas' legalized [[gambling]], have so far kept the city's proposals from achieving success.\n\nThe stadium was also considered for use as the home stadium for the [[Las Vegas Locomotives]] of the [[United Football League (2009\u2013)|United Football League]] starting in 2011; however, the team remained at [[Sam Boyd Stadium]] in [[Whitney, Nevada|Whitney]] for that season's only home game.

While it had been state-of-the-art when it opened, by the turn of the millennium it was considered far behind the times.\n\nPlayers complained that the field was hard on their backs and knees. The bullpens and clubhouse were also considered second-class. The weight room was smaller when compared to other Triple-A stadiums, with infielder [[Ty Kelly]] calling it \"basically just a room... not an actual weight room\". The batting cage was also a point of concern for the players. It was a single lane, which was only accessible by walking out of the clubhouse to the parking lot. [[Johnny Monell]] described the cage as one likely to be found at a high school facility and not up to par for a Triple-A stadium.<ref name=BHefland>{{Cite news|url=http://www.reviewjournal.com/sports/baseball/51s/it-s-not-hard-find-why-51s-want-out-cashman-field|title=It's not hard to find why 51s want out of Cashman Field|last=Hefland|first=Betsy|date=September 3, 2016|newspaper=Las Vegas Review-Journal|access-date=December 20, 2016}}</ref>\n\nDuring a 51s game on August 22, 2015, the stadium sewage system backed up, causing raw sewage to flow into the dugouts.

In a letter to the [[Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority]] which owned and operated the facility, he wrote that ensuring that the upgrades necessary to keep Cashman at something approaching Triple-A standards would require spending \"many tens of millions of dollars\" that would still not be enough to make the stadium \"an optimal long-term solution.\" He also added that Cashman's days of useful life were \"well behind it,\" and that most MLB teams opted to place their top affiliations in \"far less appropriate markets\" than Las Vegas rather than deal with Cashman's shortcomings.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.reviewjournal.com/opinion/columns-blogs/ron-kantowski/pcl-president-admonishes-lvcva-over-crumbling-cashman-field|title=PCL president admonishes LVCVA over crumbling Cashman Field|last=Kantowski|first=Ron|date=January 21, 2016|newspaper=Las Vegas Review-Journal|access-date=December 20, 2016}}</ref> In 2019, Cashman was replaced as a baseball park by Las Vegas Ballpark in Summerlin. \n\n==Redevelopment and the future of Cashman Field==\nIn 2017, the [[Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority]], which had been the primary operators of Cashman Center and Cashman Field, turned over all operations to the City of Las Vegas.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.reviewjournal.com/business/tourism/lvcva-to-turn-over-cashman-center-to-city-of-las-vegas-early/|title=LVCVA to turn over Cashman Center to city of Las Vegas early|last=Velotta|first=Richard|date=March 14, 2017|newspaper=Las Vegas Review-Journal|access-date=June 16, 2019}}</ref> Since that time, the city has attempted to redevelop and revitalize the site, even soliciting ideas from the public.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bdcnetwork.com/design-competition-900000-line-las-vegas-revitalization-challenge|title=Design competition: $900,000 on the line in Las Vegas revitalization challenge|date=May 7, 2014|access-date=June 16, 2019}}</ref> In 2018, the site was considered for a proposed stadium for the [[National Football League | National Football League's]] [[Oakland Raiders]] during the team's relocation bid, however it was beat out by a larger site closer to the [[Las Vegas Strip]].

The stadium would have served as home field until a permanent facility could be built. It had come up in the city's talks to lure the former [[Montreal Expos]], [[Florida Marlins]], and Oakland Athletics. However, the park would have needed considerable expansion, particularly in seating capacity, in order to host a team. The substantial costs which would be incurred in expansion and construction of a new stadium, as well as MLB concerns over Las Vegas' legalized [[gambling]], have so far kept the city's proposals from achieving success.\n\nThe stadium was also considered for use as the home stadium for the [[Las Vegas Locomotives]] of the [[United Football League (2009\u2013)|United Football League]] starting in 2011; however, the team remained at [[Sam Boyd Stadium]] in [[Whitney, Nevada|Whitney]] for that season's only home game.

Cashman Field was also featured as a landmark in the video game ''[[Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas]]'', in the city of \"Las Venturas\".\n\n== Problems and criticism ==\nDuring the last years of the 51s' stay at Cashman Field, players and staff from both the 51s and visiting teams criticized the facility. While it had been state-of-the-art when it opened, by the turn of the millennium it was considered far behind the times.\n\nPlayers complained that the field was hard on their backs and knees. The bullpens and clubhouse were also considered second-class. The weight room was smaller when compared to other Triple-A stadiums, with infielder [[Ty Kelly]] calling it \"basically just a room... not an actual weight room\". The batting cage was also a point of concern for the players. It was a single lane, which was only accessible by walking out of the clubhouse to the parking lot. [[Johnny Monell]] described the cage as one likely to be found at a high school facility and not up to par for a Triple-A stadium.<ref name=BHefland>{{Cite news|url=http://www.reviewjournal.com/sports/baseball/51s/it-s-not-hard-find-why-51s-want-out-cashman-field|title=It's not hard to find why 51s want out of Cashman Field|last=Hefland|first=Betsy|date=September 3, 2016|newspaper=Las Vegas Review-Journal|access-date=December 20, 2016}}</ref>\n\nDuring a 51s game on August 22, 2015, the stadium sewage system backed up, causing raw sewage to flow into the dugouts.

In a letter to the [[Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority]] which owned and operated the facility, he wrote that ensuring that the upgrades necessary to keep Cashman at something approaching Triple-A standards would require spending \"many tens of millions of dollars\" that would still not be enough to make the stadium \"an optimal long-term solution.\" He also added that Cashman's days of useful life were \"well behind it,\" and that most MLB teams opted to place their top affiliations in \"far less appropriate markets\" than Las Vegas rather than deal with Cashman's shortcomings.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.reviewjournal.com/opinion/columns-blogs/ron-kantowski/pcl-president-admonishes-lvcva-over-crumbling-cashman-field|title=PCL president admonishes LVCVA over crumbling Cashman Field|last=Kantowski|first=Ron|date=January 21, 2016|newspaper=Las Vegas Review-Journal|access-date=December 20, 2016}}</ref> In 2019, Cashman was replaced as a baseball park by Las Vegas Ballpark in Summerlin. \n\n==Redevelopment and the future of Cashman Field==\nIn 2017, the [[Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority]], which had been the primary operators of Cashman Center and Cashman Field, turned over all operations to the City of Las Vegas.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.reviewjournal.com/business/tourism/lvcva-to-turn-over-cashman-center-to-city-of-las-vegas-early/|title=LVCVA to turn over Cashman Center to city of Las Vegas early|last=Velotta|first=Richard|date=March 14, 2017|newspaper=Las Vegas Review-Journal|access-date=June 16, 2019}}</ref> Since that time, the city has attempted to redevelop and revitalize the site, even soliciting ideas from the public.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bdcnetwork.com/design-competition-900000-line-las-vegas-revitalization-challenge|title=Design competition: $900,000 on the line in Las Vegas revitalization challenge|date=May 7, 2014|access-date=June 16, 2019}}</ref> In 2018, the site was considered for a proposed stadium for the [[National Football League | National Football League's]] [[Oakland Raiders]] during the team's relocation bid, however it was beat out by a larger site closer to the [[Las Vegas Strip]].

Economies that are afflicted by a high level of corruption are not capable of prospering as fully as those with a low level of corruption. Also, economies that are corrupted are not able to function properly since the natural laws of the economy can not function freely. As a consequence, corruption, for instance, leads to an inefficient allocation of resources, poor education, and healthcare or the presence of a shadow economy, a kind of economy that includes illegal activities as well as unreported income from the production of legal goods and services for which taxes should be paid, but are not. <ref name=\":0\">[https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/012215/how-corruption-affects-emerging-economies.asp How Corruption Affects Emerging Economies].

Since Rose-Ackerman's article \"The Economics of Corruption\", published in the ''Journal of Public Economics'' in 1975,<ref>Rose-Ackerman S. : \"The Economics of Corruption\", ''Journal of\nPolitical Economy'', Vol. IV, 1975, pp. 187-203.</ref> more than 3,000 articles have been written with 'corruption' in the title, at least 500 of which directly focus on different aspects relating to corruption using an economic framework.<ref>JSTOR search on 8 March 2008</ref> Some books have also been published on the subject.<ref>''The Economics of Corruption'', edited by Ajit Mishra, 2005 : Oxford University Press</ref>\n\n== What countries are the most corrupted? ==\nNo country has been able to eliminate corruption, but studies show that the level of corruption in countries with emerging market economies, which means that the nation\u2019s economy is progressing toward becoming more advanced, usually through significant GDP growth and industrialization, is much higher than it is in developed countries.<ref name=\":2\">Most Corrupt Countries Population.

(2002). They find a significant positive impact of corruption on inequality while taking into account exogenous variables. Corruption has also impact on income inequality through numerous channels, for instance, economic growth, biased tax system, asset ownership, etc.<ref name=\":3\">SANJEEV, Gupta, Davoodi HAMID a Alonso Terme ROSA. Does Corruption Affect Income Inequality and Poverty?. 1998. Working paper. International Money Fund.</ref> \n\nFirstly, corruption can significantly affect targeting of social problems. When the economy is corrupted and government-funded programs are used to extend benefits to wealthy populations groups or when poverty reduction funds are not used as they should because of corruption, the impact of social programs on income distribution could significantly diminish. Also, the higher corruption, the lower tax revenue, which results in lower resources for funding services such as education, etc. \n\nSecondly, corruption can affect income inequality also through biased tax system. Corruption can lead to poor tax administration or exemptions that could favor the wealthy ones with connections. As a result, the progressivity of the tax system could reduce, thus income inequality is possible.<ref name=\":3\" /> \n\nFurthermore, when most of the asset is owned by elite groups of the population, they can take advantage of their wealth and lobby the government for favorable trade policies, which potentially could result in income inequality. <ref name=\":3\" /> \n\n== Corruption and its effect on price == \n\nIf the economy is corrupted, there may be some business owners who can use their connections and money to bribe government officials, as a result not only policies but also market mechanisms are manipulated and such companies could become a sole provider of goods or services, in other words, those companies could become a monopolistic or oligopolistic company. Monopolistic companies do not have to compete against others, thus they tend to set prices high and do not have an incentive for innovation and improving the quality of goods or services. <ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Corruption and disincentive for innovation == \n\nThere may be a disincentive for innovation also because the legal system of corrupted economies is not trustworthy enough. Potential inventors cannot be sure that their invention will be protected by patents and not copied by those who could bribe the authorities. That could be the reason why emerging countries usually import technology instead of innovating within their societies. <ref name=\":1\" /> \n \n== Corruption and growth of GDP == \nCorruption breeds inefficiencies that may affect the static level of output. In order for corruption to affect economic growth as a whole, it must affect population growth, capital accumulation, or total factor productivity. A 1995 study by Paulo Mauro <ref>The Quarterly Journal of Economics, Volume 110, Issue 3, August 1995, Pages 681\u2013712, https://doi.org/10.2307/2946696</ref> shows that capital accumulation, in the form of investment, is negatively correlated with corruption, particularly foreign direct investment <ref>Wei, Shang-Jin. \"How taxing is corruption on international investors?.\" Review of economics and statistics 82.1 (2000): 1-11.</ref>. Due to the fact that technological advances are primarily driven by investment, this correlation also reveals that corruption can negatively affect total factor productivity. \n\nAccording to Pak Hung Mo, political instability is the most important channel through which corruption affects economic growth. This study shows that a 1% increase in the corruption level means that the growth rate is reduced by about 0.72%. In other words, a one-unit increase in the corruption index reduces the growth rate by 0.545 percentage points. <ref>PAK, Hung Mo. Corruption and Economic Growth. Kowloon Tong, Hong Kong, 2000. School of Business, Hong Kong Baptist University. </ref>\n\nFurthermore, income inequality harms the economy, on the contrary, according to new OECD analysis, reducing income inequality would boost economic growth. <ref name=\":4\">Inequality hurts economic growth, finds OECD research. In: STEFANO, Scarpetta a Cingano FEDERICO. OECD: Better policies for better life [online]. 12.09.2014 [cit. 2020-03-21]. </ref> For instance, Mexico\u2019s rising inequality knocked off more than 10 percentage points off growth over the past two decades up to the Great Recession. Besides, there are countries like Spain, France, and Ireland, where greater equality helped increase GDP per capita before the crisis. <ref name=\":4\" />\n\nThe OECD study also finds evidence, that the main mechanism through which inequality affects growth is by undermining education opportunities for children from families with poor socioeconomic status, which measures person's work experience and also person\u2019s or family's economic and social position to others, which lowers social mobility.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n== Corruption and education and healthcare == \n\nCorruption harms the quality of education and healthcare in emerging economies according to the International Monetary Fund. That is because the cost of education in corrupted countries increases, especially when bribes influence the recruitment and promotion of teachers, consequently, the quality of education decreases. Not only quality of education decreases, but also corruption in healthcare has a huge impact. Many things can be affected by corruption, for instance, the designation of healthcare providers, recruitment of personnel or procurement of medical supplies and equipment. As a result, it leads to inadequate healthcare treatment and restricted medical supply, which results in lower quality of overall healthcare.<ref name=\":0\" /> \n\n== Corruption and shadow economy == \n\nMany studies were carried on the relationship between corruption and shadow economy, which is still not very clear. The majority of them found that corruption is associated with tax evasion, because of bribery of officials by entrepreneurs. In this case, corruption increases shadow economy and lower economic growth.<ref>AXEL, Dreher a Schneider FRIEDRICH. Corruption and the shadow economy: an empirical analysis. 2006/02/01.</ref>For instance, studies that were carried by Johnson et al. (1997), Fjeldstad (1996, 2003), Buehn and Schneider (2009) and Kaufman (2010) revealed such empirical findings that showed a positive relationship between corruption and shadow economy. <ref name=\":5\">BORLEA, Sorin, Monica-Violeta ACHIM a Miron MONICA. Corruption, Shadow Economy and Economic Growth: An Empirical Survey Across the European Union Countries. 2017. Studia Universitatis Vasile Goldis Arad, Seria Stiinte Economice ER.</ref> \n\nHowever, in high-income countries, public goods are more efficient and only small businesses tend to pay bribes and avoid taxation. Consequently, the income generated by such businesses exists outside the official economy, therefore the income is not included in the calculation of the country's GDP. <ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":5\" /> Also, such business not only that pay their employees lower than the minimum wage, that is designed by the government in the country, but also they do not provide for instance health insurance benefits and other employee benefits.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nOn the contrary, the big companies tend to bribe officials to get a contract from the public sector, which means, that the contract is conducted in the official sector. In consequence, the relationship between corruption and shadow economy has been found negative in high-income countries.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n== Corruption and low foreign investment == \n\nInvestors often seek a fair competitive business environment, thus they will mostly avoid investing in countries where there is a high level of corruption. Studies show a positive relationship between the level of corruption in a country and measurements of the competitiveness of its business environment.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Combatting Corruption on the Micro Level == \n\nAccording to Robert Klitgaard's equation, corruption = monopoly + discretion - accountability<ref>Klitgaard, Robert. Controlling corruption. Univ of California Press, 1988.</ref>. Therefore, corruption is able to emerge and grow when there is a private or public monopoly over a good or service and this individual or group has the discretionary power to allocate the good or service with few checks and balances and few, if any, consequences. By targeting individual components of the equation, there are several ways to fight corruption. First of all, reducing monopoly necessitates encouraging competition. This may be accomplished by publishing public procurement data online or making government contracts available to a wider range of potential firms. Successful examples of this include the case of countries such as Mexico, who made all government contracts and procurement plans available online so the general public could view plans, prices, and bid winners. Secondly, limiting discretion means making laws and government procedures accessible for a broad cross section of society to view. This may be accomplished by the publication of documents detailing legal requirements for acquiring permits etc. in common languages and in an accessible format. Finally, increasing accountability may be accomplished by inviting impartial third parties to conduct government audits, as well as continually monitor and evaluate government procedures. This has been a success in countries such as Singapore and Hong Kong <ref>Quah, Jon ST. \"Controlling corruption in city-states: A comparative study of Hong Kong and Singapore.\" Crime, Law and Social Change 22.4 (1994): 391-414.</ref>.\n\n==Books on economics of corruption==\nSome books have been produced with the specific title of \"economics of corruption\". One of these is ''The Economics of Corruption'' edited by [[Ajit Mishra]] published by the [[Oxford University Press]] in 2005. This book is an anthology of 11 essays under 4 categories, written by 16 economists. The titles of the essays give an idea of the various approaches taken by different economists. They are quoted below :\n* Corruption : an Overview\n* Corruption : Its causes and Effects\n* Hierarchies and Bureaucracies: On the role of Collusion in Organizations\n* A Theory of Misgovernance\n* Pervasive Shortages under Socialism\n* Corruption and Growth\n* Corruptible Law Enforcers : How should they be compensated?\n* Notes on bribery and control of corruption\n* The Choice between Market failures and corruption\n* Rents, Competition and corruption\n* Electoral competition and Special Interest Politics\n\nOne can observe that these essays do not capture corruption in all its economic essence. Hundreds of essays have been published during the last two decades that deal with many more aspects of corruption from an economic perspective. Some other books are :\n* Rose-Ackerman, S. : ''Corruption - A study in Political Economy'', 1978, Academic Press, New York.\n* Ekpo, M. U.

However, Ananish [[Chaudhuri]] has classified the foci of economic analyses of corruption into fourteen broad categories.<ref>[[Faizul Latif Chowdhury]], \"Economic Approaches in Corruption Studies\", ''Fiscal Frontiers'', 2008, Dhaka.</ref> These are:\n\n* Economic causes of corruption\n* Rent-seeking in the public offices, including Judiciary\n* Corruption as an economic behavior, e.g. game theoretic explanation\n* Demand for and Supply of corruption, optimal level of corruption, optimal level of bribery, efficiency of the market in corruption\n* Impact of corruption on the competitiveness in the market for goods and services\n* Measurement of the level of corruption, comparative county-studies\n* Corruption in different economic activities, e.g. public procurement, defense procurement\n* Sources of corruption: Revenue collection, Foreign aid, Foreign Direct Investment\n* Corruption in the private sector, Economies in transition\n* Impact of corruption on [[economic growth]], national [[regional development|development]] and the level of [[poverty]]\n* Welfare impact of corruption, Income redistribution resulting from corruption\n* Factors affecting corruption, e.g. [[Shadow economy]], [[Smuggling]], [[weak state]], corruption by [[politicians]]\n* Relation between corruption on the one hand and other economic-social-cultural aspects like technological progress, environment and ecology,\n* Economic factors relating to [[anti-corruption programs]], e.g. optimal level of punishment for corruption etc.\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n{{economics-stub}}\n\n{{Use dmy dates|date=January 2011}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Economics Of Corruption}}\n[[Category:Corruption]]\n[[Category:Public economics]]\n", "text_old": "{{rewrite|date=February 2019}}\n\n== What is economics of corruption? == \n\nEconomics of corruption deals with the misuse of public power for private benefit and its economic impact on society.

(2002). They find a significant positive impact of corruption on inequality while taking into account exogenous variables. Corruption has also impact on income inequality through numerous channels, for instance, economic growth, biased tax system, asset ownership, etc.<ref name=\":3\">SANJEEV, Gupta, Davoodi HAMID a Alonso Terme ROSA. Does Corruption Affect Income Inequality and Poverty?. 1998. Working paper. International Money Fund.</ref> \n\nFirstly, corruption can significantly affect targeting of social problems. When the economy is corrupted and government-funded programs are used to extend benefits to wealthy populations groups or when poverty reduction funds are not used as they should because of corruption, the impact of social programs on income distribution could significantly diminish. Also, the higher corruption, the lower tax revenue, which results in lower resources for funding services such as education, etc. \n\nSecondly, corruption can affect income inequality also through biased tax system. Corruption can lead to poor tax administration or exemptions that could favor the wealthy ones with connections. As a result, the progressivity of the tax system could reduce, thus income inequality is possible.<ref name=\":3\" /> \n\nFurthermore, when most of the asset is owned by elite groups of the population, they can take advantage of their wealth and lobby the government for favorable trade policies, which potentially could result in income inequality. <ref name=\":3\" /> \n\n== Corruption and its effect on price == \n\nIf the economy is corrupted, there may be some business owners who can use their connections and money to bribe government officials, as a result not only policies but also market mechanisms are manipulated and such companies could become a sole provider of goods or services, in other words, those companies could become a monopolistic or oligopolistic company. Monopolistic companies do not have to compete against others, thus they tend to set prices high and do not have an incentive for innovation and improving the quality of goods or services. <ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Corruption and disincentive for innovation == \n\nThere may be a disincentive for innovation also because the legal system of corrupted economies is not trustworthy enough. Potential inventors cannot be sure that their invention will be protected by patents and not copied by those who could bribe the authorities. That could be the reason why emerging countries usually import technology instead of innovating within their societies. <ref name=\":1\" /> \n \n== Corruption and growth of GDP == \nCorruption breeds inefficiencies that may affect the static level of output. In order for corruption to affect economic growth as a whole, it must affect population growth, capital accumulation, or total factor productivity. A 1995 study by Paulo Mauro <ref>The Quarterly Journal of Economics, Volume 110, Issue 3, August 1995, Pages 681\u2013712, https://doi.org/10.2307/2946696</ref> shows that capital accumulation, in the form of investment, is negatively correlated with corruption, particularly foreign direct investment <ref>Wei, Shang-Jin. \"How taxing is corruption on international investors?.\" Review of economics and statistics 82.1 (2000): 1-11.</ref>. Due to the fact that technological advances are primarily driven by investment, this correlation also reveals that corruption can negatively affect total factor productivity. \n\nAccording to Pak Hung Mo, political instability is the most important channel through which corruption affects economic growth. This study shows that a 1% increase in the corruption level means that the growth rate is reduced by about 0.72%. In other words, a one-unit increase in the corruption index reduces the growth rate by 0.545 percentage points. <ref>PAK, Hung Mo. Corruption and Economic Growth. Kowloon Tong, Hong Kong, 2000. School of Business, Hong Kong Baptist University. </ref>\n\nFurthermore, income inequality harms the economy, on the contrary, according to new OECD analysis, reducing income inequality would boost economic growth. <ref name=\":4\">Inequality hurts economic growth, finds OECD research. In: STEFANO, Scarpetta a Cingano FEDERICO. OECD: Better policies for better life [online]. 12.09.2014 [cit. 2020-03-21]. </ref> For instance, Mexico\u2019s rising inequality knocked off more than 10 percentage points off growth over the past two decades up to the Great Recession. Besides, there are countries like Spain, France, and Ireland, where greater equality helped increase GDP per capita before the crisis. <ref name=\":4\" />\n\nThe OECD study also finds evidence, that the main mechanism through which inequality affects growth is by undermining education opportunities for children from families with poor socioeconomic status, which measures person's work experience and also person\u2019s or family's economic and social position to others, which lowers social mobility.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n== Corruption and education and healthcare == \n\nCorruption harms the quality of education and healthcare in emerging economies according to the International Monetary Fund. That is because the cost of education in corrupted countries increases, especially when bribes influence the recruitment and promotion of teachers, consequently, the quality of education decreases. Not only quality of education decreases, but also corruption in healthcare has a huge impact. Many things can be affected by corruption, for instance, the designation of healthcare providers, recruitment of personnel or procurement of medical supplies and equipment. As a result, it leads to inadequate healthcare treatment and restricted medical supply, which results in lower quality of overall healthcare.<ref name=\":0\" /> \n\n== Corruption and shadow economy == \n\nMany studies were carried on the relationship between corruption and shadow economy, which is still not very clear. The majority of them found that corruption is associated with tax evasion, because of bribery of officials by entrepreneurs. In this case, corruption increases shadow economy and lower economic growth.<ref>AXEL, Dreher a Schneider FRIEDRICH. Corruption and the shadow economy: an empirical analysis. 2006/02/01.</ref>For instance, studies that were carried by Johnson et al. (1997), Fjeldstad (1996, 2003), Buehn and Schneider (2009) and Kaufman (2010) revealed such empirical findings that showed a positive relationship between corruption and shadow economy. <ref name=\":5\">BORLEA, Sorin, Monica-Violeta ACHIM a Miron MONICA. Corruption, Shadow Economy and Economic Growth: An Empirical Survey Across the European Union Countries. 2017. Studia Universitatis Vasile Goldis Arad, Seria Stiinte Economice ER.</ref> \n\nHowever, in high-income countries, public goods are more efficient and only small businesses tend to pay bribes and avoid taxation. Consequently, the income generated by such businesses exists outside the official economy, therefore the income is not included in the calculation of the country's GDP. <ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":5\" /> Also, such business not only that pay their employees lower than the minimum wage, that is designed by the government in the country, but also they do not provide for instance health insurance benefits and other employee benefits.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nOn the contrary, the big companies tend to bribe officials to get a contract from the public sector, which means, that the contract is conducted in the official sector. In consequence, the relationship between corruption and shadow economy has been found negative in high-income countries.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n== Corruption and low foreign investment == \n\nInvestors often seek a fair competitive business environment, thus they will mostly avoid investing in countries where there is a high level of corruption. Studies show a positive relationship between the level of corruption in a country and measurements of the competitiveness of its business environment.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Combatting Corruption on the Micro Level == \n\n According to Robert Klitgaard's equation, corruption = monopoly + discretion - accountability<ref>Klitgaard, Robert. Controlling corruption. Univ of California Press, 1988.</ref>. Therefore, corruption is able to emerge and grow when there is a private or public monopoly over a good or service and this individual or group has the discretionary power to allocate the good or service with few checks and balances and few, if any, consequences. By targeting individual components of the equation, there are several ways to fight corruption. First of all, reducing monopoly necessitates encouraging competition. This may be accomplished by publishing public procurement data online or making government contracts available to a wider range of potential firms. Successful examples of this include the case of countries such as Mexico, who made all government contracts and procurement plans available online so the general public could view plans, prices, and bid winners. Secondly, limiting discretion means making laws and government procedures accessible for a broad cross section of society to view. This may be accomplished by the publication of documents detailing legal requirements for acquiring permits etc. in common languages and in an accessible format. Finally, increasing accountability may be accomplished by inviting impartial third parties to conduct government audits, as well as continually monitor and evaluate government procedures. This has been a success in countries such as Singapore and Hong Kong <ref>Quah, Jon ST. \"Controlling corruption in city-states: A comparative study of Hong Kong and Singapore.\" Crime, Law and Social Change 22.4 (1994): 391-414.</ref>.\n\n==Books on economics of corruption==\nSome books have been produced with the specific title of \"economics of corruption\". One of these is ''The Economics of Corruption'' edited by [[Ajit Mishra]] published by the [[Oxford University Press]] in 2005. This book is an anthology of 11 essays under 4 categories, written by 16 economists. The titles of the essays give an idea of the various approaches taken by different economists. They are quoted below :\n* Corruption : an Overview\n* Corruption : Its causes and Effects\n* Hierarchies and Bureaucracies: On the role of Collusion in Organizations\n* A Theory of Misgovernance\n* Pervasive Shortages under Socialism\n* Corruption and Growth\n* Corruptible Law Enforcers : How should they be compensated?\n* Notes on bribery and control of corruption\n* The Choice between Market failures and corruption\n* Rents, Competition and corruption\n* Electoral competition and Special Interest Politics\n\nOne can observe that these essays do not capture corruption in all its economic essence. Hundreds of essays have been published during the last two decades that deal with many more aspects of corruption from an economic perspective. Some other books are :\n* Rose-Ackerman, S. : ''Corruption - A study in Political Economy'', 1978, Academic Press, New York.\n* Ekpo, M. U.

Corruption as an economic, social and political problem. Corruption's specific features in economies in transition.\n*2. Corruption and rent-seeking behavior. Basic model of rent-seeking and its research. Problem of rent's dissipation.\n*3. Static and dynamic models of [[Rent-seeking]]. Cases of pure and mixed public goods.\n*4.

Statistical and econometrical approaches towards research of corruption.\n*14. Macroeconomics aspects of corruption. Problems in estimation of corruption influence on economic development.\n\nEvidently, the course has limited focus and in many ways do not directly address relevant areas of corruption which have already been analyzed from an economic perspective.\n\n==Approaches to economic analyses of corruption==\nAs indicated above, a systematic pattern in research on corruption from economic perspective is yet to emerge. However, Ananish [[Chaudhuri]] has classified the foci of economic analyses of corruption into fourteen broad categories.<ref>[[Faizul Latif Chowdhury]], \"Economic Approaches in Corruption Studies\", ''Fiscal Frontiers'', 2008, Dhaka.</ref> These are:\n\n* Economic causes of corruption\n* Rent-seeking in the public offices, including Judiciary\n* Corruption as an economic behavior, e.g. game theoretic explanation\n* Demand for and Supply of corruption, optimal level of corruption, optimal level of bribery, efficiency of the market in corruption\n* Impact of corruption on the competitiveness in the market for goods and services\n* Measurement of the level of corruption, comparative county-studies\n* Corruption in different economic activities, e.g. public procurement, defense procurement\n* Sources of corruption: Revenue collection, Foreign aid, Foreign Direct Investment\n* Corruption in the private sector, Economies in transition\n* Impact of corruption on [[economic growth]], national [[regional development|development]] and the level of [[poverty]]\n* Welfare impact of corruption, Income redistribution resulting from corruption\n* Factors affecting corruption, e.g. [[Shadow economy]], [[Smuggling]], [[weak state]], corruption by [[politicians]]\n* Relation between corruption on the one hand and other economic-social-cultural aspects like technological progress, environment and ecology,\n* Economic factors relating to [[anti-corruption programs]], e.g. optimal level of punishment for corruption etc.\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n{{economics-stub}}\n\n{{Use dmy dates|date=January 2011}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Economics Of Corruption}}\n[[Category:Corruption]]\n[[Category:Public economics]]\n", "name_user": "Lilymcrae", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eCombatting Corruption on the Micro Level", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economics_of_corruption"}

The Dewey was very large and [[state of the art]]  at her time. ''Dewey'' was 500 feet in length, had a beam with of 132 feet, and a working deck surface 100 feet wide. The sidewalls reached 42 feet above the deck. She displaced 18,500 tons empty. She had a draft of from 6.5 to 8 feet.  [[Ballast tank|Ballast]] [[Pontoon (boat)|pontoons]] [[Water tank|tanks]] were flooded with water to [[Underwater|submerge]] or [[pump]]ed dry to raise the ship. The 14-foot wide sidewalls contained crew [[barrack]], officer [[First class travel|stateroom]] [[Cabin (ship)|cabin]]s for officers, two [[mess hall]]s, [[machine shop]]s, and a [[Steam-electric power station|steam plant]] to run the pumps.\n\nOn 28 December 1905, ''Dewey'' began a journey to her station in the Philippines under tow by [[Collier (ship type)|collier]]s {{USS|Caesar|AC-16|2}} and {{USS|Brutus|AC-15|2}}, [[stores ship]] {{USS|Glacier|AF-4|2}}, and [[tug]] {{USS|Potomac|AT-50|2}}.

It is closely associated with [[social contract]] philosophers such as [[Thomas Hobbes]], [[John Locke]] and [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]].

The central tenet is that the legitimacy of rule or of [[law]] is based on the [[consent of the governed]]. Popular sovereignty is thus a basic tenet of most [[Republic]]s, and in some monarchies. Hobbes, Locke, and Rousseau were the most influential thinkers of this school, all postulating that individuals choose to enter into a social contract with one another, thus voluntarily giving up some of their natural freedom in return for protection from dangers derived from the freedom of others. Whether men were seen as naturally more prone to violence and rapine (Hobbes) or cooperation and kindness (Rousseau), the idea that a legitimate social order emerges only when the liberties and duties are equal among citizens binds the social contract thinkers to the concept of popular sovereignty.\n\nA parallel development of a theory of popular sovereignty can be found among the [[School of Salamanca#Sovereignty|School of Salamanca]] (see e.g. [[Francisco de Vitoria]] (1483\u20131546) or [[Francisco Suarez]] (1548\u20131617)), who (like the theorists of the [[Divine right of kings|divine right]] of kings and Locke) saw sovereignty as emanating originally from [[God]], but (unlike divine right theorists and in agreement with Locke) passing from [[God]] to all people equally, not only to [[monarch]]s.\n\n[[Republic]]s and [[popular monarchies]] is theoretically based on popular sovereignty. However, a legalistic notion of popular sovereignty does not necessarily imply an effective, functioning [[democracy]]: a party or even an individual [[dictator]] may claim to represent the will of the people, and rule in its name, pretending to detain ''[[auctoritas]]''. That would be congruent with Hobbes's view on the subject, but not with most modern definitions that see democracy as a necessary condition of popular sovereignty.\n\n==United States==\n{{Main|Popular sovereignty in the United States}}\nThe application of the doctrine of popular sovereignty receives particular emphasis in American history, notes historian Christian G.

It said that actual residents of territories should be able to decide by voting whether or not slavery would be allowed in the territory. The federal government did not have to make the decision, and by appealing to democracy Cass and Douglas hoped they could finesse the question of support for or opposition to slavery. Douglas applied popular sovereignty to Kansas in the [[Kansas Nebraska Act]] which passed Congress in 1854. The Act had two unexpected results. By dropping the Missouri Compromise of 1820 (which said slavery would never be allowed in Kansas), it was a major boost for the expansion of slavery. Overnight outrage united anti-slavery forces across the North into an \"anti-Nebraska\" movement that soon was institutionalized as the [[History of the Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]], with its firm commitment to stop the expansion of slavery. Second, pro- and anti-slavery elements moved into Kansas with the intention of voting slavery up or down, leading to a raging civil war, known as \"[[Bleeding Kansas]]\". Abraham Lincoln targeted popular sovereignty in the Lincoln-Douglas Debates of 1858, leaving Douglas in a position that alienated Southern pro-slavery Democrats who thought he was too weak in his support of slavery.

They date from around 17,000 to 12,000 years ago.{{efn|name=DATES}}{{is this date calibrated?}} It is named after the [[type site]] of [[La Madeleine (prehistoric site)|La Madeleine]], a rock shelter located in the V\u00e9z\u00e8re valley, commune of [[Tursac]], in [[France|France's]] [[Dordogne]] department.\n\n[[\u00c9douard Lartet]] and [[Henry Christy]] originally termed the period ''L'\u00e2ge du renne'' (the [[Age of the Reindeer]]). They conducted the first systematic excavators of the type site, publishing in 1875. The Magdalenian [[epoch]] is associated with [[reindeer]] hunters, although Magdalenian sites contain extensive evidence for the hunting of red deer, horses, and other large [[mammals]] present in [[Europe]] toward the end of the [[last glacial period]]. The culture was geographically widespread, and later Magdalenian sites stretched from Portugal in the west to Poland in the east. It is the third [[Epoch (geology)|epoch]] of [[Gabriel de Mortillet| Gabriel de Mortillet's]] cave chronology system, corresponding roughly to the [[Late Pleistocene]].\nBesides La Madeleine, the chief stations of the epoch are [[Les Eyzies]], [[Laugerie-Basse]], and Gorges d'Enfer in the [[Dordogne]]; Grotte du Placard in [[Charente]] and others in south-west France.\n\n==Period biology==\nThe Magdalenian epoch is represented by numerous stations, whose contents show progress in arts and culture. It was characterized by a cold and dry climate, humans in association with the reindeer, and the extinction of the [[mammoth]]. The use of bone and ivory as implements, begun in the preceding [[Solutrian epoch]], increased, making the period essentially a bone period. Bone instruments are quite varied: spear-points, [[harpoon]]-heads, borers, hooks and needles.\n\nThe fauna of the Magdelenian epoch seems to have included tigers and other tropical species along with reindeer, blue foxes, Arctic hares, and other polar creatures. Magdelenian humans appear to have been of short stature, [[dolichocephalic]], with a low retreating forehead and prominent [[brow ridge]]s.\n\n==Chronology==\n[[File:Magdalenian tools 17000 9000 BCE Abri de la Madeleine Tursac Dordogne France.jpg|thumb|left|Magdalenian tools and weapons, 17,000{{nsndns}}9,000 BCE, Abri de la Madeleine, [[Tursac]], [[Dordogne]], [[France]]]]\n[[File:Pincevent tent.gif|thumb|right|Magdalenian people dwelt not just in caves, but also in tents such as this one of Pincevent (France) that dates to 12,000 years ago.{{is this date calibrated?}}]]\n\nThe culture spans from approximately 17,000 to 12,000 [[Before Present|BP]],{{is this date calibrated?}} toward the end of the most recent [[ice age]]. Magdalenian tool culture is characterised by regular [[blade]] industries struck from [[carinate]]d cores. \n\nThe Magdalenian epoch is divided into six phases generally agreed to have chronological significance. The earliest phases are recognised by the varying proportion of blades and specific varieties of scrapers, the middle phases marked by the emergence of a microlithic component (particularly the distinctive [[denticulate tool|denticulated]] [[microliths]]), and the later phases by the presence of uniserial (phase{{nbsp}}5) and biserial 'harpoons' (phase{{nbsp}}6) made of bone, antler and ivory.{{sfn|de Sonneville-Bordes|Perrot|1956}}\n\nDebate continues about the nature of the earliest Magdalenian assemblages, and it remains questionable whether the Badegoulian culture is the earliest phase of Magdalenian culture. Similarly, finds from the forest of Beauregard near Paris have been suggested as belonging to the earliest Magdalenian.{{sfn|Hemingway|1980}} The earliest Magdalenian sites are in France. The [[Epigravettian]] is a similar culture appearing at the same time. Its known range extends from southeast France to the western shores of the [[Volga River]], Russia, with many sites in Italy.\n\nThe later phases of Magdalenian culture are contemporaneous with the human re-settlement of north-western Europe after the [[Last Glacial Maximum]] during the [[Late Glacial Maximum]].{{sfn|Housley|Gamble|Street|Pettitt|1997}}{{sfn|Charles|1996}} As hunter gatherers, Magdalenians did not re-settle permanently in northwest Europe, instead following herds and seasons.\n\nBy the end of the Magdalenian epoch, lithic technology shows a pronounced trend toward increased microlithisation. The bone harpoons and points have the most distinctive chronological markers within the typological sequence. As well as flint tools, Magdalenians are known for their elaborate worked bone, antler and [[ivory]] that served both functional and aesthetic purposes, including [[b\u00e2ton de commandement|perforated batons]].\n\nThe sea shells and fossils found in Magdalenian sites may be sourced to relatively precise areas and have been used to support hypotheses of Magdalenian hunter-gatherer seasonal ranges, and perhaps trade routes. \n\nIn northern Spain and south-west France this tool culture was superseded by the [[Azilian]] culture. In northern Europe it was followed by variants of the [[Federmesser culture|Tjongerian]] techno-complex. It has been suggested that key Late-glacial sites in south-western Britain may be attributed to Magdalenian culture, including [[Kent's Cavern]].\n\n== Art ==\nBones, reindeer antlers and animal teeth display crude pictures carved or etched on them of seals, fish, reindeer, mammoths and other creatures. \n\nThe best of Magdalenian artworks are a mammoth engraved on a fragment of its own ivory;{{doubtful|date=June 2013}}<!-- How do we know that? --> a dagger of reindeer antler, with a handle in form of a reindeer; a cave-bear cut on a flat piece of [[schist]]; a seal on a bear's tooth; a fish drawn on a reindeer antler; and a complete picture, also on reindeer antler, showing horses, an [[aurochs]], trees, and a snake biting a man's leg. The man is naked, which, together with the snake, suggests a warm climate in spite of the presence of the reindeer.\n\nExamples of Magdalenian portable art include batons, [[figurine]]s, and intricately engraved projectile points, as well as items of personal adornment including sea shells, perforated [[carnivore]] teeth (presumably necklaces), and fossils.\nCave sites such as [[Lascaux]] contain the best known examples of Magdalenian [[cave art]]. The site of [[Altamira (cave)|Altamira]] in Spain, with its extensive and varied forms of Magdalenian [[Portable art|mobiliary art]] has been suggested to be an agglomeration site where groups of Magdalenian hunter-gatherers congregated.{{sfn|Conkey|Beltr\u00e1n|Clark|Echegaray|1980}}\n\n==Genetics==\nIn a genetic study published in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' in May 2016, the remains of seven Magdalenians were examined. The three samples of [[Y-DNA]] analyzed were determined to be two samples of haplogroup [[Haplogroup I-M170|I]] and one sample of [[Haplogroup HIJK|HIJK]]. Of the seven samples of [[mtDNA]], all belonged to [[Haplogroup U (mtDNA)|U]], including five samples of [[Haplogroup U (mtDNA)#Haplogroup U8|U8b]] and one sample of [[Haplogroup U (mtDNA)#Haplogroup U5|U5b]].

Copeland Sr. was emancipated as a boy about 1815.  As a young man, he married Evans and they lived near [[Hillsboro, North Carolina]] until 1843, when the family fled racial persecution, first to [[Cincinnati, Ohio]] and then to Oberlin.

His high quality of literacy and self-expression was demonstrated by later letters to his family (see below). As a young man, he became involved in the [[Oberlin Anti-Slavery Society]]. Together with his maternal uncles, Henry and Wilson Bruce Evans, in September, 1858, Copeland was one of the thirty-seven men involved in the incident known as the [[Oberlin-Wellington Rescue]], to free John Price, a [[Fugitive slave|runaway slave]] who had been captured and held by authorities under the 1850 [[Fugitive Slave Act]]. The men freed the slave and helped him escape to Canada.  In a negotiated deal between state and federal officials, only two men were tried for their part.  They received light sentences, in part due to [[Charles Henry Langston]]'s eloquence.<ref name=brandt/>\n\nIn September 1859 Copeland was recruited to [[John Brown (abolitionist)|John Brown]]'s armed group by his uncle and fellow raider, [[Lewis Sheridan Leary]]. Brown led twenty-one followers, sixteen white and five black men, and captured the armory guards of Harpers Ferry, then part of Virginia, where they took control of the Federal arsenal. The raiders were soon pinned down by [[Virginia]] [[militiamen]] until [[U.S. marines]] led by [[Robert E. Lee]] arrived to apprehend them.\n\nCopeland's role in the Harpers Ferry assault was to seize control of Hall's Rifle Works, along with [[John Henry Kagi]], a white raider. Kagi and several others were killed while trying to escape from the Rifle Works by swimming across the [[Shenandoah River]]. Copeland was captured alive, taken in the middle of the river.\n\nCopeland, Brown, and five others were held for trial by the state of Virginia.  At the trial, Copeland was found guilty of [[murder]] and conspiracy to incite slaves to rebellion and sentenced to death by [[hanging]].<ref>Steven Lubet, ''The \"Colored Hero\" of Harper's Ferry: John Anthony Copeland and the War Against Slavery '' (Cambridge University Press, 2015) p.181.</ref>\n\nCopeland wrote to his family to make meaning from his sacrifice. Six days before his execution, he wrote to his brother, referring to the [[American Revolution]]:\n\n<blockquote>And now, brother, for having lent my aid to a general no less brave [than George Washington], and engaged in a cause no less honorable and glorious, I am to suffer death. Washington entered the field to fight for the freedom of the American people - not for the white man alone, but for both black and white.  Nor were they white men alone who fought for the freedom of this country. The blood of black men flowed as freely as the blood of white men.
