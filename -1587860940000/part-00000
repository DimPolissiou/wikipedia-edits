It tells the story of a family embroiled in the \"[[White Terror (Taiwan)|White Terror]]\" that was wrought on the [[Taiwanese people]] by the [[Kuomintang|Kuomintang government]] (KMT) after their arrival from [[mainland China]] in the late 1940s, during which thousands of Taiwanese and recent emigres from the Mainland were rounded up, shot, and/or sent to prison. The film was the first to deal openly with the KMT's authoritarian misdeeds after its 1945 takeover of [[Taiwan]], which had been restored to China following [[Japan|Japan's]] defeat in [[World War II]], and the first to depict the [[February 28 Incident]] of 1947, in which thousands of people were massacred.\n\n''A City of Sadness'' was the first (of three) Taiwanese films to win the [[Golden Lion]] award at the [[Venice Film Festival]], and is often considered Hou's masterpiece.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XAeGAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA190|title=Encyclopedia of Chinese Film|page=190|author1-last=Xiao|author1-first=Zhiwei|author2-last=Zhang|author2-first=Yingjin|publisher=Routledge|date=2002|isbn=1134745540}}</ref> The film was selected as the Taiwanese entry for the [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film|Best Foreign Language Film]] at the [[62nd Academy Awards]], but was not accepted as a nominee.<ref>Margaret Herrick Library, Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n{{More plot|date=November 2015}}\nSeen through the prism of the Lin family, the drama details a brief but crucial moment in Taiwanese history between 1945, when 50 years of Japanese colonial rule came to an end, and 1949, when [[Chiang Kai-shek]]'s Nationalist Kuomintang forces established a government-in-exile after the Communist army captured mainland China.\n\nThe film opens with the voice of [[Emperor Hirohito]] announcing Japan's surrender as the eldest of the Lin clan's four sons awaits the birth of his child in a coastal town not far from Taipei. Soon afterward, he changes the name of his Japanese decorated bar to \"Little Shanghai\" and begins trading in the post-war black market. The second son has died in Philippines during the war.\n\nThe third son, who had a nervous breakdown in Shanghai, starts to consort with Shanghaiese drug dealers upon his return to Taiwan. Once the eldest learns of the third's dealings, he forces him to stop. In retaliation, the Shanghaiese mob arranges for the third son to be imprisoned on made-up charges of collaboration with the Japanese.\n\nThe youngest son, Wen-ching, is a gentle, deaf-mute photographer with leftist leanings. The film climaxes with the [[February 28 Incident]] of 1947, a massacre of native Taiwanese committed by Kuomintang troops. The wounded pour into the neighbor clinic as Wen-ching and his friend Hinoe get arrested. After his release, Hinoe heads for the mountains to join the leftist guerillas while Wen-ching promises to look after his friend's sister Hinomi. Soon after, Wen-ching and Hinomi marry. Not long after she bears a child, however, the Kuomintang arrests Wen-ching for his involvement with the guerillas.\n\n==Cast==\n\n*[[Tony Leung Chiu-wai]] as Lin Wen-ching (\u6797\u6587\u6e05), the deaf middle brother, an aspiring photographer\n*[[Chen Sung-young]] as Lin Wen-heung (\u6797\u6587\u96c4), eldest brother\n*[[Jack Kao]] as Lin Wen-leung (\u6797\u6587\u826f), traumatised by his time in the war\n*[[Li Tian-lu]] as Lin Ah-lu (\u6797\u963f\u797f)\n*[[Xin Shufen]] as Hinomi (Hinome)\n*[[Wu Yi-fang (actor)|Wu Yi-fang]] as Hinoiei\n*[[Nakamura Ikuyo]] as Shizuko\n*[[Jan Hung-tze]] as Mr. Lin\n*[[Wu Nien-jen]] as Mr. Wu\n*[[Zhang Dachun]] as Reporter Ho\n*[[Tsai Chen-nan]] as singer (cameo appearance)\n\n==Production==\n''A City of Sadness'' was filmed on location in [[Jiufen]], an old and declined gold mining town in northeast of Taiwan. \n\nAt the beginning of the Taiwanese New Cinema, most people filmed the backdrop of their own coming of age and their experiences of Taiwan, ten years after novels [explored these themes]. The 228 Incident discussed in A City of Sadness had always been taboo in Taiwan and remained so even ten years later in 1989. But with the death of Chiang Ching-kuo and the lifting of martial law, the times had changed and a space had opened to use cinema to deal with this subject\u2026\nFirst I read a book by a reporter called The Truth of the 228 Incident. Except for that, there were basically no books [on the subject]. We gathered material from newspapers of the time and went to interview some people, but most of them weren\u2019t very talkative\u2026 Everybody knew about the 228 Incident. Nobody would say anything, at least in public, but behind closed doors everyone was talking about it, especially in the Tangwai movement\u2026 The 228 Incident was already known, so I was more interested in filming a time of transition, and the changes in a family during a change in regime. This was the main thing I wanted to capture\u2026\nThere\u2019s been too much political intervention. We should go back to history itself for a comprehensive reflection, but politicians like to use this tragedy as an ATM, making a withdrawal from it whenever they want. It\u2019s awful. So no matter what point of view I took with the film, people would still criticize it. I was filming events that were still taboo, I had a point of view, and no matter what, I was filming from the point of view of people and a family\u2026 Of course it\u2019s limited by the filmmaker\u2019s vision and attitude. I can only present a part of the atmosphere of the time.\n\u2013Hou Hsiao-hsien\n\nAccording to scriptwriter Chu Tien-Wen's book, the original premise of the film was the reunion of an ex-gangster (which Hou Hsiao-Hsien intended to cast [[Chow Yun-fat]] for the role) and his former lover (supposedly played by [[Yang Li-Hua]], the top Taiwanese Opera actress in real-life) in 1970s. Hou and Chu then extended the story to involve substantial flashbacks of the calamity of the woman's family in late 1940s (where the woman was the teenage daughter of Chen Song-Yong's character). They then abandoned the former premise and instead focused on the 1940s' story.\n\nWen-ching's deafness began as an expedient way to disguise Tony Leung's inability to speak Taiwanese (or Japanese\u2014the language taught in Taiwan's schools during the 51-year [[Taiwan under Japanese rule|Japanese rule]]), but wound up being an effective means to demonstrate the brutal insensitivity of [[Chen Yi (Kuomintang)|Chen Yi]]'s ROC administration.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} \n\nThis film is regarded as the first installment in a trilogy of Hsiao-Hsien's films that deal with Taiwanese history, which also includes ''[[The Puppetmaster (film)|The Puppetmaster]]'' (1993) and ''[[Good Men, Good Women]]'' (1995).\n\n==Reception and impact==\n''A City of Sadness'' was a major commercial success in Taiwan, but critics were largely ambivalent toward the work. Having been advertised as a film about the [[February 28 Incident]] but never explicitly depicting the event, the film was consequently criticized as politically ambiguous, as well as overly difficult to follow.<ref name=\"Harvard\">{{cite web|url=http://sites.fas.harvard.edu/~chlit130/handouts/handouts_10/cityofsadness.html|title=A City of Sadness|work=Harvard Faculty of Arts and

The heirs of Yazlovets are recorded in history for their contribution to the defense of Christendom against the Turkic invasion. Since 1340 until the [[Partitions of Poland]] (1772), Jaz\u0142owiec belonged to the [[Kingdom of Poland (1385\u20131569)|Kingdom of Poland]] and the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]].\n\nIn the 16th century a stone church dedicated to the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary, a monastery of the [[Dominican Order]] and a castle were constructed. In 1615 the Jazlowiecki family issued privileges encouraging Armenian refugees from the [[Crimea]] to settle in the town, similar to those found in [[Kamianets-Podilskyi|Kamieniec Podolski]], which brought in increased income from trade. The town's prosperity lasted until 1672, when it was captured by the [[Ottomans]] and occupied for ten years (see [[Polish\u2013Ottoman War (1672\u201376)]]). It was nominally ruled by Ottomans between 1684-1699 and ravaged by Poles and Turks in this period. It was a sanjak centre as \"Yazlof\u00e7a\" in [[Podolia Eyalet]] of Ottoman Empire. Jazlowiec returned to Poland after the [[Treaty of Karlowitz]].\n\nIn the 18th century Jazlowiec was the property of successively Koniecpolski, Lubomirski and Poniatowski families. In 1718 the [[Pauline Fathers]] were invited to the town. In 1772 the town was detached from Poland, and came under [[Austrian Empire|Austrian]] rule, the policies of [[Emperor Joseph II]] led to the closing of both monasteries. In 1810 the ruined Armenian church was restored, given to the towns Ukrainian community and consecrated to St. Nicholaus. \n\nIn 1863 [[Marcelina Darowska]] established the monastery of the [[Sisters of the Immaculate Conception of the Blessed Virgin Mary (1857)|Sisters of the Immaculate Conception of the Blessed Virgin Mary]] in the ruined castle donated for this purpose. The sisters ministered in education first in Yazlovets itself and then creating a network of rural elementary schools. A Statue of Immaculately Conceived Mother of God was consecrated by saint archbishop [[Zygmunt Szcz\u0119sny Feli\u0144ski|Sigismund Felix Feli\u0144ski]] in 1883 in the monastery's chapel and in 1939 crowned by the Cardinal Primate of Poland [[August Hlond]] with a crown given conferred by [[Pope Pius XII]].\n\nDuring [[World War I]] Yazlovets was heavily damaged by Russians in 1916. \n\nAfter the formation in November 1918 [[West Ukrainian People's Republic]] (ZUNR) Yazlovets came of it. \n\nOn July 11 - 13, 1919 a three-day-long battle was fought over the city by Poles and Ukrainians locked in a [[Polish-Ukrainian War|fratricidal conflict]], each trying to secure their statehood. The battle against unit of [[Ukrainian Galician Army]] was won by Poles; and until the [[Invasion of Poland]], Jazlowiec belonged to [[Tarnopol Voivodeship]], [[Second Polish Republic]]. To commemorate Polish victory in the 1919 battle, 14th Uhlan Regiment of the [[Polish Army]], stationed in the interwar period in [[Lwow]] (Lviv), was called the [[14th Regiment of Jazlowiec Uhlans]]. Following the 1939 [[Soviet Invasion of Poland]], the region fell under Soviet rule with the outbreak of [[World War II]].\n\nIn 1945 the town was degraded to the status of a village and renamed to Yablunivka, or Yablonovka in Russian, and most of its Polish residents were resettled in the so-called [[Recovered Territories]]. The monastery was closed by communists in 1946. However following the collapse of the soviet union and the reemergence of independent Ukraine after half a century the original name was restored and the monastery was renewed.

The SAC was founded in 1975 as a football-only conference and became an all-sports conference beginning with the 1989\u201390 season.\n\nThe league currently sponsors 10 sports for men (football, cross country, soccer, basketball, wrestling, baseball, lacrosse, outdoor track & field, tennis, golf) and 10 sports for women (volleyball, cross country, field hockey, soccer, basketball, lacrosse, outdoor track & field, softball, tennis, and golf).\n\n==History==\n{{OSM Location map\n| float = right\n| width = 400\n| height = 275\n| coord = {{coord|35.5|-82}} \n| nolabels = 1\n| title = South Atlantic Conference\n| mark-coord  = {{coord|34.514 |-82.638}} |label=Anderson      |label-pos  = left   | mark  = Location dot orange.svg  | label-color  = black\n| mark-coord1 = {{coord|36.121944 |-83.492222}} |label1=Carson\u2013Newman  |label-pos1 = left   | mark1 = Location dot orange.svg  | label-color1 = black\n| mark-coord2 = {{coord|35.6914 |-80.4844}} |label2=Catawba     |label-pos2 = right   | mark2 = Location dot orange.svg  | label-color2 = black\n| mark-coord3 = {{coord|34.376778 |-80.069444}} |label3=Coker |label-pos3 = right   | mark3 = Location dot orange.svg  | label-color3 = black\n| mark-coord4 = {{coord|35.740235 |-81.325501}} |label4=Lenoir-Rhyne |label-pos4 = top  | mark4 = Location dot orange.svg  | label-color4 = black\n| mark-coord5 = {{coord|36.5808 |-83.6566}} |label5=Lincoln Memorial |label-pos5 = left   | mark5 = Location dot orange.svg  | label-color5 = black\n| mark-coord6 = {{coord|35.82603 |-82.5507}} |label6=Mars Hill     |label-pos6 = left   | mark6 = Location dot orange.svg  | label-color6 = black\n| mark-coord7 = {{coord|34.2851 |-81.6207}} |label7=Newberry |label-pos7 = right   | mark7 = Location dot orange.svg  | label-color7 = black\n| mark-coord8 = {{coord|35.188833 |-80.832318}} |label8=Queens |label-pos8 = right  | mark8 = Location dot orange.svg  | label-color8 = black\n| mark-coord9 = {{coord|36.173611 |-82.761389}} |label9=Tusculum     |label-pos9 = top   | mark9 = Location dot orange.svg  | label-color9 = black\n| mark-coord10 = {{coord|34.985448 |-80.444473}} |label10=Wingate     |label-pos10 = right   | mark10 = Location dot orange.svg  | label-color10 = black\n| mark-coord11 = {{coord|36.9725 |-82.556111}} |label11=UVA\u2013Wise     |label-pos11 = left  | mark11 = Location dot orange.svg  | label-color11 = black\n| mark-coord12 = {{coord|35.054813 |-81.648714}} |label12=Limestone |labe12-pos7 = right   | mark12 = Location dot black.svg  | label-color12 = black\n| zoom = 6                <!--(1=whole world, 18=a street)-->\n| caption = Location of SAC members: [[Image:Location dot orange.svg|10px]] current and [[Image:Location dot black.svg|10px]] future\n}}\n\nThe distant forerunner of the '''South Atlantic Conference''' was the '''North State Intercollegiate Athletic Conference''' (NSIAC). The NSIAC was formed when the \"Little Six\", as it was called, broke from the '''North Carolina Intercollegiate Athletic Conference''' in 1930. The charter members included [[Appalachian State University|Appalachian State Teachers College]] (now Appalachian State University), [[Lenoir\u2013Rhyne University|Lenoir\u2013Rhyne College]] (now Lenoir\u2013Rhyne University), [[Barton College|Atlantic Christian College]] (now Barton College), [[Catawba College]], [[Guilford College]], [[Elon University|Elon College]] (now Elon University), and [[High Point University|High Point College]] (now High Point University).\n\nThe North State continued to grow over the next 30 years, adding [[Western Carolina University]] (1933), [[East Carolina University]] (1947) and [[Pfeiffer University|Pfeiffer College]] (now Pfeiffer University) (1960). A name change became necessary when the league accepted [[Newberry College]] as its first member from the state of [[South Carolina]] in 1961. The league took on the name [[Conference Carolinas|Carolinas Intercollegiate Athletic Conference]] (CIAC) on May 20 of that year.\n\nThe CIAC saw several changes in the following years as East Carolina withdrew from the league in 1962. Appalachian State and Western Carolina followed in 1971 and 1976. All three landed in the [[Southern Conference]] (SoCon).\n\nThe '''South Atlantic Conference''' was founded in 1975 solely as a football conference. The league received its name from a contest in which Kurt Brenneman of [[Greensboro, North Carolina]] became the first to submit the SAC-8 moniker.\n\nThe SAC-8 consisted of [[Carson\u2013Newman University|Carson\u2013Newman College]] (now Carson\u2013Newman University), Catawba College, Elon College, [[Gardner\u2013Webb University|Gardner\u2013Webb College]] (now Gardner\u2013Webb University), Lenoir\u2013Rhyne College (now Lenoir-Rhyne University), [[Mars Hill University|Mars Hill College]] (now Mars Hill University), Newberry College, and [[Presbyterian College]]. Dr. Fred Bentley, of Mars Hill College, was named league president for its inaugural year, by a vote of the member institutions.\n\nAfter the first season of play in the SAC-8, the Bears of Lenoir\u2013Rhyne College captured the first football title.\n\nIn 1989, the league's 15th year of operation, the South Atlantic Conference became a comprehensive, multi-sport conference. Doug Echols was named the league's first Commissioner. That year the South Atlantic Conference sponsored 10 sports \u2013 football, men's and women's basketball, baseball, softball, men's soccer, volleyball, men's golf, men's and women's tennis. Later the conference grew to 14 championship sports by adding women's soccer (1990), men's and women's cross country (1993) and women's golf (1999). In 2013, the sports of men's and women's lacrosse and men's and women's track and field were added, increasing the number of championship sports to 18.\n\nThe South Atlantic Conference was composed of the same eight member institutions from 1975\u201376 until 1988\u201389, when [[Wingate University|Wingate College]] (now Wingate University) replaced Newberry College as the eighth member institution. Newberry College later re-joined the conference in the 1996\u201397 season.\n\nIn July 1998, [[Tusculum University|Tusculum College]] (now Tusculum University) was admitted as a member of the league, and [[Lincoln Memorial University]] began play in the conference in the 2006\u201307 academic year. [[Brevard College]] was admitted to the SAC as a provisional member in 2007 and a full member in 2008.\n\nIn 2008, Echols retired after serving as Commissioner for 19 years and Patrick Britz was hired as the new Commissioner.\n\nIn July 2010, [[Anderson University (South Carolina)|Anderson University]] became the league's 10th member. Three years later in July 2013, [[Coker University|Coker College]] (now Coker University) and [[Queens University of Charlotte]] joined the conference.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thesac.com/about/history|title=History of the SAC|publisher=South Atlantic Conference|accessdate=June 4, 2014}}</ref> On April 13, 2018, [[University of Virginia's College at Wise|UVA\u2013Wise]] (in full, the University of Virginia's College at Wise) announced that it was joining the South Atlantic Conference for the 2019-20 season.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.uvawisecavs.com/news/2018/4/12/general-uva-wise-to-join-south-atlantic-conference-in-2019-20.aspx|title=UVa-Wise to Join South Atlantic Conference in 2019-20|work=UVaWiseCavs.com|date=April 13, 2018|accessdate=April 15, 2018}}</ref> The most recent change to the conference membership was announced on April 5, 2019, when [[Limestone College]], which had joined as a football-only member in 2017 and added field hockey to its SAC membership the next year, was announced as a new full member effective in 2020\u201321, the same time it is set to attain university status.<ref>{{cite press release|url=https://www.thesac.com/general/2018-19/releases/20190404n24t4v |title=Limestone College to Join South Atlantic Conference in 2020-21 |publisher=South Atlantic Conference |date=April 5, 2019 |accessdate=April 26, 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe SAC and [[Conference Carolinas]] entered into a partnership in the 2018\u201319 school year by which the two leagues would operate as a single conference in field hockey and wrestling, with championships immediately conducted in both sports.

The SAC was founded in 1975 as a football-only conference and became an all-sports conference beginning with the 1989\u201390 season.\n\nThe league currently sponsors 10 sports for men (football, cross country, soccer, basketball, wrestling, baseball, lacrosse, outdoor track & field, tennis, golf) and 10 sports for women (volleyball, cross country, field hockey, soccer, basketball, lacrosse, outdoor track & field, softball, tennis, and golf).\n\n==History==\n{{OSM Location map\n| float = right\n| width = 400\n| height = 275\n| coord = {{coord|35.5|-82}} \n| nolabels = 1\n| title = South Atlantic Conference\n| mark-coord  = {{coord|34.514 |-82.638}} |label=Anderson      |label-pos  = left   | mark  = Location dot orange.svg  | label-color  = black\n| mark-coord1 = {{coord|36.121944 |-83.492222}} |label1=Carson\u2013Newman  |label-pos1 = left   | mark1 = Location dot orange.svg  | label-color1 = black\n| mark-coord2 = {{coord|35.6914 |-80.4844}} |label2=Catawba     |label-pos2 = right   | mark2 = Location dot orange.svg  | label-color2 = black\n| mark-coord3 = {{coord|34.376778 |-80.069444}} |label3=Coker |label-pos3 = right   | mark3 = Location dot orange.svg  | label-color3 = black\n| mark-coord4 = {{coord|35.740235 |-81.325501}} |label4=Lenoir-Rhyne |label-pos4 = top  | mark4 = Location dot orange.svg  | label-color4 = black\n| mark-coord5 = {{coord|36.5808 |-83.6566}} |label5=Lincoln Memorial |label-pos5 = left   | mark5 = Location dot orange.svg  | label-color5 = black\n| mark-coord6 = {{coord|35.82603 |-82.5507}} |label6=Mars Hill     |label-pos6 = left   | mark6 = Location dot orange.svg  | label-color6 = black\n| mark-coord7 = {{coord|34.2851 |-81.6207}} |label7=Newberry |label-pos7 = right   | mark7 = Location dot orange.svg  | label-color7 = black\n| mark-coord8 = {{coord|35.188833 |-80.832318}} |label8=Queens |label-pos8 = right  | mark8 = Location dot orange.svg  | label-color8 = black\n| mark-coord9 = {{coord|36.173611 |-82.761389}} |label9=Tusculum     |label-pos9 = top   | mark9 = Location dot orange.svg  | label-color9 = black\n| mark-coord10 = {{coord|34.985448 |-80.444473}} |label10=Wingate     |label-pos10 = right   | mark10 = Location dot orange.svg  | label-color10 = black\n| mark-coord11 = {{coord|36.9725 |-82.556111}} |label11=Virginia\u2013Wise     |label-pos11 = left  | mark11 = Location dot orange.svg  | label-color11 = black\n| mark-coord12 = {{coord|35.054813 |-81.648714}} |label12=Limestone |labe12-pos7 = right   | mark12 = Location dot black.svg  | label-color12 = black\n| zoom = 6                <!--(1=whole world, 18=a street)-->\n| caption = Location of SAC members: [[Image:Location dot orange.svg|10px]] current and [[Image:Location dot black.svg|10px]] future\n}}\n\nThe distant forerunner of the '''South Atlantic Conference''' was the '''North State Intercollegiate Athletic Conference''' (NSIAC). The NSIAC was formed when the \"Little Six\", as it was called, broke from the '''North Carolina Intercollegiate Athletic Conference''' in 1930. The charter members included [[Appalachian State University|Appalachian State Teachers College]] (now Appalachian State University), [[Lenoir\u2013Rhyne University|Lenoir\u2013Rhyne College]] (now Lenoir\u2013Rhyne University), [[Barton College|Atlantic Christian College]] (now Barton College), [[Catawba College]], [[Guilford College]], [[Elon University|Elon College]] (now Elon University), and [[High Point University|High Point College]] (now High Point University).\n\nThe North State continued to grow over the next 30 years, adding [[Western Carolina University]] (1933), [[East Carolina University]] (1947) and [[Pfeiffer University|Pfeiffer College]] (now Pfeiffer University) (1960). A name change became necessary when the league accepted [[Newberry College]] as its first member from the state of [[South Carolina]] in 1961. The league took on the name [[Conference Carolinas|Carolinas Intercollegiate Athletic Conference]] (CIAC) on May 20 of that year.\n\nThe CIAC saw several changes in the following years as East Carolina withdrew from the league in 1962. Appalachian State and Western Carolina followed in 1971 and 1976. All three landed in the [[Southern Conference]] (SoCon).\n\nThe '''South Atlantic Conference''' was founded in 1975 solely as a football conference. The league received its name from a contest in which Kurt Brenneman of [[Greensboro, North Carolina]] became the first to submit the SAC-8 moniker.\n\nThe SAC-8 consisted of [[Carson\u2013Newman University|Carson\u2013Newman College]] (now Carson\u2013Newman University), Catawba College, Elon College, [[Gardner\u2013Webb University|Gardner\u2013Webb College]] (now Gardner\u2013Webb University), Lenoir\u2013Rhyne College (now Lenoir-Rhyne University), [[Mars Hill University|Mars Hill College]] (now Mars Hill University), Newberry College, and [[Presbyterian College]]. Dr. Fred Bentley, of Mars Hill College, was named league president for its inaugural year, by a vote of the member institutions.\n\nAfter the first season of play in the SAC-8, the Bears of Lenoir\u2013Rhyne College captured the first football title.\n\nIn 1989, the league's 15th year of operation, the South Atlantic Conference became a comprehensive, multi-sport conference. Doug Echols was named the league's first Commissioner. That year the South Atlantic Conference sponsored 10 sports \u2013 football, men's and women's basketball, baseball, softball, men's soccer, volleyball, men's golf, men's and women's tennis. Later the conference grew to 14 championship sports by adding women's soccer (1990), men's and women's cross country (1993) and women's golf (1999). In 2013, the sports of men's and women's lacrosse and men's and women's track and field were added, increasing the number of championship sports to 18.\n\nThe South Atlantic Conference was composed of the same eight member institutions from 1975\u201376 until 1988\u201389, when [[Wingate University|Wingate College]] (now Wingate University) replaced Newberry College as the eighth member institution. Newberry College later re-joined the conference in the 1996\u201397 season.\n\nIn July 1998, [[Tusculum College]] was admitted as a member of the league, and [[Lincoln Memorial University]] began play in the conference in the 2006\u201307 academic year. [[Brevard College]] was admitted to the SAC as a provisional member in 2007 and a full member in 2008.\n\nIn 2008, Echols retired after serving as Commissioner for 19 years and Patrick Britz was hired as the new Commissioner.\n\nIn July 2010, [[Anderson University (South Carolina)|Anderson University]] became the league's 10th member.

The leagues agreed that the SAC would coordinate the field hockey championship, while CC would fill the same role for wrestling. Accordingly, all CC field hockey programs became SAC affiliates, and all SAC wrestling programs became CC affiliates.<ref>{{cite press release|url=http://www.conferencecarolinas.com/sports/Misc./2017-18/FHWR |title=Conference Carolinas and The South Atlantic Conference Partner to Sponsor Field Hockey and Wrestling |publisher=South Atlantic Conference |date=January 25, 2018 |accessdate=December 16, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Member schools==\n\n===Charter members===\nNewberry College left the SAC in 1989 (as a football member), and re-joined in 1996 (as an all-sport member).
