At the time, Chris was living in Saskatchewan, Canada and working at Cameco Corporation as an IT Solutions Architect and Josh was living in London, UK and working with RBC as an Investment Banker. Each day, Josh and his colleagues worked long hours and often ordered food to their office from local restaurants. Josh began to recognize that there was an opportunity to help other working professionals gain time in their days by building out a more efficient [[online food ordering]] delivery network. Eventually, both resigned from their jobs and began working on the concept for SkipTheDishes. They launched the network in their home city of Saskatoon, Saskatchewan and eventually moved to Winnipeg, Manitoba to set up the tech company\u2019s head office.\n\n===Founders===\nBetween 2012 and 2014, three additional co-founders joined to help grow the [[startup company|startup]]. Another brother, Daniel Simair, joined, along with two friends from university - Jeff Adamson and Andrew Chau.\n\n===Investment===\nDuring the first few years of operations, the co-founders [[bootstrapped]] the company and raised a small round of [[Seed money|seed capital]] from [[angel investor]]s. Shortly after, the co-founders raised additional capital from private investors, as well as four prominent [[venture capital]] firms - Golden Venture Partners ([[Toronto]], [[Ontario]]), Founder Collective ([[New York City|New York]], [[New York (state)|New York]]), Felicis Ventures ([[Menlo Park, California|Menlo Park]], [[California]]), and FJ Labs ([[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]], [[Massachusetts]]).\n\n===Geography===\nAs the company scaled between 2013-2016, the co-founders launched SkipTheDishes in many Canadian cities, initially focusing on mid-market cities, including [[Burnaby]], [[East Vancouver]], [[Calgary]], [[Edmonton]], [[Red Deer, Alberta|Red Deer]], [[Prince Albert, Saskatchewan|Prince Albert]], [[Grande Prairie]], [[Regina, Saskatchewan|Regina]], [[Saskatoon]], [[Winnipeg]], [[Mississauga]], [[Etobicoke]], [[Kitchener, Ontario|Kitchener]]/[[Waterloo, Ontario|Waterloo]], and [[Ottawa]], as well as American cities, including [[Columbus, Ohio|Columbus]], [[Cleveland]], [[Cincinnati]], [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]], [[Omaha]], and [[St. Louis]].\n\n===Acquisition===\nIn December 2016, SkipTheDishes was acquired by [[Just Eat]] for $200M. SkipTheDishes remained a subsidiary and separate brand from Just Eat, with its Canadian headquarters to stay in [[Winnipeg]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/technology/winnipeg-startup-skipthedishes-purchased-by-britains-just-eat/article33341734/ |title=Winnipeg startup SkipTheDishes gobbled up by Britain's Just Eat |last=Silcoff |first=Sean |date=December 15, 2016 |website=[[The Globe and Mail]] |access-date=August 28, 2018}}</ref> As of September 2018, Just Eat Canada redirects to SkipTheDishes.<ref>{{cite tweet |user=JUSTEATca |number=1037144022714855425 |date=September 4, 2018 |title=Hello Steve, We're joining with Skip the Dishes to provide you with even a better food ordering experience.

Customers order through the SkipTheDishes website or mobile [[iOS]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]] apps. They can pay for their orders online with credit cards, debit cards, or in-person with cash when their orders arrive. Restaurants receive orders on their integrated mobile apps, and couriers are allocated to orders through their integrated mobile apps. Customers can view the status of their orders through live updates on the app, and are given transparency into the location of their assigned courier through GPS tracking.\n\nRestaurants and couriers can be reviewed by customers after they have received their orders. This helps to provide both feedback and transparency to the rest of the network about the efficiency and effectiveness of its stakeholders.\n\nSkipTheDishes operates across Canada and in select markets in the United States. Since its founding in 2012, SkipTheDishes continues to advance the technological innovation required for building the future of food [[delivery (commerce)|delivery]], while being instrumental in helping to create a tech hub in the [[Canadian Prairies]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/04/how-winnipeg-focused-on-local-strengths-to-create-a-tech-hub-in-central-canada/ |title=How Winnipeg focused on local strengths to create a tech hub in central Canada |last=Fischberg |first=Ben |date=April 4, 2017 |website=[[TechCrunch]] |access-date=August 28, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Criticism==\nLike many companies involved in the [[sharing economy]], SkipTheDishes has received criticism for its business practices.
