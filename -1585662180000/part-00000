Serving as the [[eponym]]ous [[protagonist]] of the series, he is a young [[ninja]] from the fictional village of Konohagakure. The villagers ridicule Naruto on account of the [[Nine-Tailed Demon Fox]]\u2014a malevolent creature that attacked Konohagakure\u2014that was sealed away in Naruto's body. Despite this, he aspires to become his village's leader, the Hokage. His carefree, optimistic and boisterous personality enables him to befriend other Konohagakure ninja, as well as ninja from other villages. Naruto appears in the series' films and in other media related to the franchise, including video games and [[original video animation]]s (OVA), as well as the sequel ''[[Boruto: Naruto Next Generations]]'', where his son, [[Boruto Uzumaki]], is the protagonist.\n\nWhen creating Naruto for the [[List of Naruto chapters (Part I)|initial part]] of the series, Kishimoto kept the character \"simple and stupid\", while giving him many attributes of an ideal hero. Kishimoto gave Naruto a dark side by adding tragedy to the character's past. He has revised Naruto's image many times, providing the character with different clothes intended to appeal to Western audiences and to make him easier to illustrate. Kishimoto changed his design for [[List of Naruto chapters (Part II)|Part II]] of the storyline, which starts two-and-a-half years after Part I. Naruto is voiced by [[Junko Takeuchi]] in the original animated series and [[Maile Flanagan]] in the English adaptations.\n\nMerchandise based on Naruto includes [[Action figure|figurines]] and [[keychain]]s. Naruto's character development has been praised by anime and manga publications and has drawn scholarly attention. Although some initially saw him as a typical manga and anime protagonist comparable to those in other ''sh\u014dnen'' manga, others have praised his personality and character development as he avoids stereotypes typically seen in similar media.\n\nKAMERON CHASE SEPULVEDa\n===Original concept and influences===\n[[File:NarutoUzumakiKishimoto.jpg|alt=Naruto Uzumaki in his regular orange jumpsuit doing a handsign|thumb|upright|Original sketch for Naruto in Kishimoto's one-shot, ''Naruto'' (1997), which went through several alterations for the manga series due to its amount of detail|left]]\nDuring the 1990s, new manga author [[Masashi Kishimoto]] sought to write a one-shot chapter that would feature Naruto as a chef, but this version never made it to print. Kishimoto originally wanted to make Naruto a child who could transform into a fox, so he created a one-shot of ''Naruto'' for the summer 1997 issue of ''[[Akamaru Jump]]'' magazine based on the idea.<ref name=\"kizuna\">{{cite book|title=Naruto \u2013 \u30ca\u30eb\u30c8 \u2013 \u540d\u8a00\u96c6\u3000\u7d46 \u2013 Kizuna \u2013\u3000\u5929\u30ce\u5dfb|publisher=[[Shueisha]]|year=2013|isbn=978-4087206814|pages=188\u2013195|author=Kishimoto, Masashi|authorlink=Masashi Kishimoto|language=Japanese|trans-title=Naruto Kizuna: The Words That Bind \u2013 Scroll of Heaven}}</ref> When comparing both the ''Naruto'' one-shot and his other work, ''Karakuri'', Kishimoto realized that former's title character was more appealing than the lead of ''Karakuri''. Kishimoto reflects Naruto's \"honest\" smile was well received in contrast to the sly look the main character from ''Karakuri'' had. Following the success of another one-shot, ''Mario'', Kishimoto started working on the ''Naruto'' series where he wanted to reuse the title character from his earlier one-shot. Kishimoto's editor, Kosuke Yahagi, told him to write two chapters heavily focused on Naruto Uzumaki in order to show his appeal to the readers and then focus on the other protagonists. Both Yahagi and Kishimoto noted the manga's second chapter was the most difficult to write early in the series as it was meant to work on Naruto's traits and how they impact on the character [[Konohamaru Sarutobi]]. Following the second chapter, Yahagi advised Kishimoto to introduce the misrelationships Naruto had with the main cast, including his rivalry with [[Sasuke Uchiha]] and his failure at trying to attract his love interest [[Sakura Haruno]]. Although Yahagi was not Kishimoto's editor for the entire serialization, he knew how the story was planned to show Naruto's coming-of-age through multiple fights and looked forward to seeing the conclusion.<ref>{{cite journal|journal=[[Jump Square]]|title=Naruto: The Beginning|language=Japanese|publisher=[[Shueisha]]|issue=12\u201314|date=December 2014|author=}}</ref>\n\nFor the serialized version, Kishimoto incorporated traits he felt made an ideal hero in the creation of Naruto: a straightforward way of thinking, a mischievous side, and attributes possessed by [[Goku]] from the ''[[Dragon Ball]]'' franchise.

For the scenario, Pierrot received assistance from the [[CyberConnect2]] develop who had already adapted this battle through the fighting game ''[[Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 4]]''. There was a need to make every movement in the fight to look realistic, giving Sasuke scary look as well the hair movement in order to express the idea of both fighters willing to do anything to kill each other, which confused some due to Naruto's wish to avoid this fate. The final clash between Sasuke's Chidori and Naruto's Rasengan moves involved references from other scenes of the series to gave the viewer a bigger emotional impact. The staff noted that following this fight, Sasuke's face became calmer despite his initial look, giving room to explore his redemption.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pierrot2.com/naruto/2016/10/03/%E3%83%A9%E3%82%B9%E3%83%88%E3%83%90%E3%83%88%E3%83%AB%E3%81%AE%E8%A3%8F%E8%A9%B1/|title=\u30e9\u30b9\u30c8\u30d0\u30c8\u30eb\u306e\u88cf\u8a71|publisher=Pierrot|language=Japanese|accessdate=October 18, 2019}}</ref>\n\nOut of all the student-teacher relationships Kishimoto has created in the ''Naruto'' series, the bond between Naruto and [[Jiraiya (Naruto)|Jiraiya]] is his favorite, noting that it makes drawing them \"worthwhile.\"<ref>{{cite book |last=Kishimoto|first=Masashi |title=Uzumaki: the Art of Naruto|year=2007 |publisher=Viz Media |isbn=1421514079 |page=143|authorlink=Masashi Kishimoto}}</ref> Regarding bonds in the story, Kishimoto remarks to Jiraiya's death in his fight against Pain for in his last moments, he discovers the origin of Pain's multiple bodies and uses his last forces to send that message as a piece of advice to Naruto so that Naruto could defeat him in his place.<ref name=\"kizuna\"/> According to Kishimoto, this arc was the most difficult one to write; he felt this because Naruto, truly forgave his enemy.

The principal reason for this was a significant difference between the two main characters, Naruto who had no knowledge of wars, and Sasuke who was a victim of one; his entire clan had been annihilated to avoid a potential civil war. As a result, Kishimoto created Nagato as a war victim who would Jiraiya, and act as Naruto's nemesis so he would understand the tragedy that Sasuke had experienced.<ref name=\"Koba\"/> As a result, Naruto's coming-of-age would have been completed in this arc and the final arc where Naruto deals with world war and develops a vision of the shinobi world as well as how he should handle the conflict.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cinemacafe.net/article/2014/12/04/27837.html|title=\u3010\u30a4\u30f3\u30bf\u30d3\u30e5\u30fc\uff0f\u524d\u7de8\u3011\u300cNARUTO-\u30ca\u30eb\u30c8-\u300d\u539f\u4f5c\u8005\u30fb\u5cb8\u672c\u6589\u53f2\u304c\u8a9e\u308b \u5fcd\u306e\u4e16\u754c\u306e\u8a2d\u8a08\u56f3|publisher=Cinema Cafe|language=Japanese|date=December 4, 2014|accessdate=October 16, 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn the original Japanese versions of ''Naruto'', Naruto often ends his sentences with the addendum \"''-ttebayo''\" (which achieves an effect similar to ending a sentence with \"you know?\" in English).

Serving as the [[eponym]]ous [[protagonist]] of the series, he is a young [[ninja]] from the fictional village of Konohagakure. The villagers ridicule Naruto on account of the [[Nine-Tailed Demon Fox]]\u2014a malevolent creature that attacked Konohagakure\u2014that was sealed away in Naruto's body. Despite this, he aspires to become his village's leader, the Hokage. His carefree, optimistic and boisterous personality enables him to befriend other Konohagakure ninja, as well as ninja from other villages. Naruto appears in the series' films and in other media related to the franchise, including video games and [[original video animation]]s (OVA), as well as the sequel ''[[Boruto: Naruto Next Generations]]'', where his son, [[Boruto Uzumaki]], is the protagonist.\n\nWhen creating Naruto for the [[List of Naruto chapters (Part I)|initial part]] of the series, Kishimoto kept the character \"simple and stupid\", while giving him many attributes of an ideal hero. Kishimoto gave Naruto a dark side by adding tragedy to the character's past. He has revised Naruto's image many times, providing the character with different clothes intended to appeal to Western audiences and to make him easier to illustrate. Kishimoto changed his design for [[List of Naruto chapters (Part II)|Part II]] of the storyline, which starts two-and-a-half years after Part I. Naruto is voiced by [[Junko Takeuchi]] in the original animated series and [[Maile Flanagan]] in the English adaptations.\n\nMerchandise based on Naruto includes [[Action figure|figurines]] and [[keychain]]s. Naruto's character development has been praised by anime and manga publications and has drawn scholarly attention. Although some initially saw him as a typical manga and anime protagonist comparable to those in other ''sh\u014dnen'' manga, others have praised his personality and character development as he avoids stereotypes typically seen in similar media.\n\n==Creation and conception==\n===Original concept and influences===\n[[File:NarutoUzumakiKishimoto.jpg|alt=Naruto Uzumaki in his regular orange jumpsuit doing a handsign|thumb|upright|Original sketch for Naruto in Kishimoto's one-shot, ''Naruto'' (1997), which went through several alterations for the manga series due to its amount of detail|left]]\nDuring the 1990s, new manga author [[Masashi Kishimoto]] sought to write a one-shot chapter that would feature Naruto as a chef, but this version never made it to print.

Kishimoto reflects Naruto's \"honest\" smile was well received in contrast to the sly look the main character from ''Karakuri'' had. Following the success of another one-shot, ''Mario'', Kishimoto started working on the ''Naruto'' series where he wanted to reuse the title character from his earlier one-shot. Kishimoto's editor, Kosuke Yahagi, told him to write two chapters heavily focused on Naruto Uzumaki in order to show his appeal to the readers and then focus on the other protagonists. Both Yahagi and Kishimoto noted the manga's second chapter was the most difficult to write early in the series as it was meant to work on Naruto's traits and how they impact on the character [[Konohamaru Sarutobi]]. Following the second chapter, Yahagi advised Kishimoto to introduce the misrelationships Naruto had with the main cast, including his rivalry with [[Sasuke Uchiha]] and his failure at trying to attract his love interest [[Sakura Haruno]].

For the scenario, Pierrot received assistance from the [[CyberConnect2]] develop who had already adapted this battle through the fighting game ''[[Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 4]]''. There was a need to make every movement in the fight to look realistic, giving Sasuke scary look as well the hair movement in order to express the idea of both fighters willing to do anything to kill each other, which confused some due to Naruto's wish to avoid this fate. The final clash between Sasuke's Chidori and Naruto's Rasengan moves involved references from other scenes of the series to gave the viewer a bigger emotional impact.

The principal reason for this was a significant difference between the two main characters, Naruto who had no knowledge of wars, and Sasuke who was a victim of one; his entire clan had been annihilated to avoid a potential civil war. As a result, Kishimoto created Nagato as a war victim who would Jiraiya, and act as Naruto's nemesis so he would understand the tragedy that Sasuke had experienced.<ref name=\"Koba\"/> As a result, Naruto's coming-of-age would have been completed in this arc and the final arc where Naruto deals with world war and develops a vision of the shinobi world as well as how he should handle the conflict.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cinemacafe.net/article/2014/12/04/27837.html|title=\u3010\u30a4\u30f3\u30bf\u30d3\u30e5\u30fc\uff0f\u524d\u7de8\u3011\u300cNARUTO-\u30ca\u30eb\u30c8-\u300d\u539f\u4f5c\u8005\u30fb\u5cb8\u672c\u6589\u53f2\u304c\u8a9e\u308b \u5fcd\u306e\u4e16\u754c\u306e\u8a2d\u8a08\u56f3|publisher=Cinema Cafe|language=Japanese|date=December 4, 2014|accessdate=October 16, 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn the original Japanese versions of ''Naruto'', Naruto often ends his sentences with the addendum \"''-ttebayo''\" (which achieves an effect similar to ending a sentence with \"you know?\" in English).
