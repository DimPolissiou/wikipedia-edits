If the President was elected in early elections, he takes the oath, thirty days after the announcement of the results.\n\nBefore executing the powers of the office, a president is constitutionally required to take the presidential oath:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.constitution.ru/en/10003000-05.htm|title=Chapter 4.

In all cases when the President is unable to perform his duties, his powers are temporarily transferred to the [[Prime Minister of Russia|Prime Minister]] until the new President takes office.\n\n==Insignia==\nAfter the oath of office has been taken by the elected president, these following insignia are handed over to the president. These devices are used to display the rank of his office and are used on special occasions.\n\n===Chain of office===\n{{multiple image\n | height = 123\n | width = 123\n | direction = vertical\n | align = right\n | image1 = Russia president emblem.jpg\n | caption1 = Chain of office\n | image2 = Standart of the President RF.png\n | caption2 = Presidential standard\n | footer = \n}}\nThe first insignia that is issued is the [[livery collar|chain of office]] with an emblem. The central emblem is the red cross of the [[Order \"For Merit to the Fatherland\"]], with arms in equal size, charged with the [[Coat of Arms of Russia|Russian coat of arms]]. On the reverse of the cross, the words \"Benefit, Honor and Glory\" appear in the form of a circle. A golden wreath is used to connect the cross with the rest of the chain. There are 17 \"links\" in the emblem, with nine consisting of the Russian coat of arms. The other eight consist of a rosette, also bearing the motto \"Benefit, Honor and Glory.\" At the inauguration of Vladimir Putin, the emblem was placed on a red pillow, positioned on the left side of the podium. According to the Presidential website, the emblem is placed inside the Kremlin and is used only on certain occasions.\n\n===Standard (flag)===\nThe standard is a square version of the [[Flag of Russia|Russian flag]], charged in the center with the Russian coat of arms. Golden fringe is added to the standard. Copies of the standard are used inside his office, at the Kremlin, other state agencies, and while the president is traveling in a vehicle inside Russia. A 2:3 ratio version of the flag is used when the President is at sea. This is the most used symbol to denote the presence of the Russian President.\n\n===Special copy of the Constitution===\nThe President also has a special copy of the [[Constitution of Russia|Russian Constitution]] that is used during the inauguration. This copy has a hard, red cover with gold lettering. An image of the Russian coat of arms appears in silver. The special copy is kept in the Presidential Library.\n\n===Legal basis of the insignia===\nThese insignia and the procedure were established by the [[Decree of the President of Russia|presidential decree]] 1138 from 5 August 1996,<ref>Co\u0431pa\u043d\u0438e \u0437a\u043ao\u043do\u0434a\u0442e\u043b\u044cc\u0442\u0432a \u0420occ\u0438\u0439c\u043ao\u0439 \u0424e\u0434epa\u0446\u0438\u0438 1996, \u211633, ar. 3976</ref> and modified by decree 832 from 6 May 2000.<ref>Co\u0431pa\u043d\u0438e \u0437a\u043ao\u043do\u0434a\u0442e\u043b\u044cc\u0442\u0432a \u0420occ\u0438\u0439c\u043ao\u0439 \u0424e\u0434epa\u0446\u0438\u0438 2000, \u211619, ar. 2068</ref> In the new decree the special copy of the Constitution was removed as the third symbol of the Russian Presidency; the other two symbols remained intact because they were and are regulated by separate decrees. Nonetheless, the special copy of the Constitution still exists and serves for inauguration purposes only without being officially presented as a symbol of the Russian Presidency.\n\n==Powers and duties==\n[[File:Fanfares of President of the Russian Federation.ogg|thumb|The Presidential Fanfare.]]\n[[File:Address to the Federal Assembly (2012-12-12) - 09.jpeg|upright=1.15|thumb|President Vladimir Putin delivering the 2012 [[Presidential Address to the Federal Assembly (Russia)|Address to the Federal Assembly]]]]\n\n===Guarantor of the Constitution===\nAs the guarantor of the Constitution and the entire system of constitutional law, the President ensures that the constitutions, laws and regulations of the constituent territories of the Russian Federation be in full compliance with the country's Constitution and federal laws.\n\n===Nominations===\nThe President is highly active in appointing top officials in the country. He nominates candidates for official state positions, who must ultimately be appointed based on parliamentary vote. The President submits nominations to the [[Federation Council of Russia|Federation Council]], the [[upper house]] of [[Federal Assembly of Russia|the parliament]], for judges of the [[Constitutional Court]], the [[Supreme Court of Russia|Supreme Court]] and the [[Supreme Arbitration Court of Russia|Supreme Arbitration Court]], as well as for [[Prosecutor General of Russia]]. A proposal to relieve the Prosecutor General of his duties must also be submitted to the Federation Council. The President submits to the [[State Duma]], the [[lower house]] of parliament, nominations for appointment to the office of the Chairman of the [[Central Bank of Russia|Central Bank]], and likewise submits to the State Duma any proposal to relieve the Chairman of the Central Bank of his duties.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://archive.kremlin.ru/eng/articles/president03.shtml |title=Authority and Duties of the President |publisher=Archive.kremlin.ru |accessdate=3 March 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140210072025/http://archive.kremlin.ru/eng/articles/president03.shtml |archivedate=10 February 2014 |df=dmy }}</ref>\n\n===Legislation===\nUnder the procedure stipulated by the Constitution, the President exercises his [[Right of initiative (legislative)|right to submit draft legislation]], as well as the right to [[sign into law|sign bills into law]] or to [[veto]] them.\n\nThe President has the right to suspend laws and [[regulation]]s issued by executive bodies of Russia's constituent territories if such laws and regulations contravene the Constitution, federal laws or international obligations of the Russian Federation, or violate [[human rights in Russia|human]] and [[civil rights]] and liberties, pending the resolution of the issue in an appropriate court.\n\nThe President can [[Decree of the President of Russia|issue by-laws by decree]], so long as such decrees are not in contradiction with existing laws (both local and federal), Russia's international agreements or the Russian Constitution.\n\nThe President is further empowered to grant federal [[Pardon#Russia|pardons]] and reprieves, and to convene and adjourn either or both houses of the [[Federal Assembly (Russia)|Federal Assembly]] under extraordinary circumstances.\n\nOther powers of the President in the sphere of legal activities and in his interaction with the Parliament include calling [[Elections in Russia|elections]] to the State Duma, [[Dissolving parliament#Russia|dissolving the State Duma]] in certain cases, and calling [[referendum]].\n\n===Domestic policy===\nUnder the Constitution, the President is not empowered to determine the full range of short-, middle-, and long-term objectives and targets of domestic policy, but only its basic guidelines. In practice, he determines it with the Prime Minister and the Government of the Federation. They are to be implemented both by the President himself and by the [[Government of Russia]] within the bounds of their authority. The President\u2019 fundamental positions on domestic policy issues are expressed in his written decisions regarding draft federal constitutional laws and draft federal laws, as well as his letters explaining the reasons for rejecting draft federal laws.\n\nWithin the bounds of the authority granted to the head of state by the Constitution and other laws, the President also shapes the basic domestic policy guidelines by issuing legal regulations and through organizational and regulatory activity, such as issuing decrees and executive orders. Each year the President is required to make an Address to the Federal Assembly regarding the situation in the country and the internal and foreign policy of the state.\n\n===Foreign policy===\n[[File:Dmitry Medvedev and Barack Obama 7 July-3.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|Then-President [[Dmitry Medvedev]] with Then-[[US President]] [[Barack Obama]] in 2009.]]\nThe President is invested with extensive rights to implement the state's foreign policy. The President determines [[Foreign relations of Russia|Russia's position in international affairs]], along with the Prime Minister and the Government of the Federation, and represents the state in international relations, conducts negotiations and signs [[ratification]] documents. The President appoints and recalls [[diplomatic representative]]s of Russia to foreign states and [[international organization]]s. These appointments are preceded by consultations with the respective committees or commissions of the [[bicameralism|two houses]] of the Federal Assembly. The President signs [[international treaty|international treaties]].\n\n===Ceremonial duties===\nAn important ceremonial role of the President is awarding state awards. [[List of orders, decorations, and medals of the Russian Federation|State Awards of the Russian Federation]] are the highest form of official recognition given to individuals for service to the nation in the fields of defense, state-building, economics, science, culture, art, education, health care, public safety, rights advocacy and charity. The state awards of the Russian Federation include the title of [[Hero of the Russian Federation]], [[Hero of Labour of the Russian Federation]] as well as orders, medals, emblems and honorary titles. New state honors and awards can be established by the President, who also presents these honors to the recipients in an official ceremony. A Commission for State Honors, which works on a voluntary basis, helps the President to objectively assess potential recipients.\n\n==Residences==\n[[File:Kremlin Senate-1.jpg|upright=0.9|thumb|left|[[Kremlin Senate]], is the working residence of the President of Russia]]\n[[File:2018 inauguration of Vladimir Putin 05.jpg|upright=1.35|right|thumb|Vladimir Putin in Presidential Cabinet]]\n\nThe primary working President's residence is the [[Kremlin Senate|Senate building]] (also known as 1st building) in the [[Moscow Kremlin]] complex.<ref name=\"residences\">[http://www.kremlin.ru/eng/articles/atributesEng09.shtml The Presidential Residences] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090828095301/http://www.kremlin.ru/eng/articles/atributesEng09.shtml |date=28 August 2009 }}</ref> Also the President can use the [[Grand Kremlin Palace]] (used for official ceremonies and meetings).

In May 2012, [[Vladimir Putin]] became the fourth president; he was [[2018 Russian presidential election|re-elected in March 2018]] and [[Fourth inauguration of Vladimir Putin|inaugurated]] in May to a six-year term.\n\n==Selection process==\n===Eligibility===\nA candidate for office must be a citizen of the Russian Federation who is at least 35 years old and has \"permanently resided\" in Russia for at least 10 years.<ref>The Constitution of the Russian Federation: A Contextual Analysis, Henderson, Jane</ref> The Constitution of Russia [[term limits|limits]] the election of one person to the Presidency to two consecutive terms.

If the President was elected in early elections, he takes the oath, thirty days after the announcement of the results.\n\nBefore executing the powers of the office, a president is constitutionally required to take the presidential oath:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.constitution.ru/en/10003000-05.htm|title=Chapter 4.

In all cases when the President is unable to perform his duties, his powers are temporarily transferred to the [[Prime Minister of Russia|Prime Minister]] until the new President takes office.\n\n==Insignia==\nAfter the oath of office has been taken by the elected president, these following insignia are handed over to the president. These devices are used to display the rank of his office and are used on special occasions.\n\n===Chain of office===\n{{multiple image\n | height = 123\n | width = 123\n | direction = vertical\n | align = right\n | image1 = Russia president emblem.jpg\n | caption1 = Chain of office\n | image2 = Standart of the President RF.png\n | caption2 = Presidential standard\n | footer = \n}}\nThe first insignia that is issued is the [[livery collar|chain of office]] with an emblem. The central emblem is the red cross of the [[Order \"For Merit to the Fatherland\"]], with arms in equal size, charged with the [[Coat of Arms of Russia|Russian coat of arms]]. On the reverse of the cross, the words \"Benefit, Honor and Glory\" appear in the form of a circle. A golden wreath is used to connect the cross with the rest of the chain. There are 17 \"links\" in the emblem, with nine consisting of the Russian coat of arms. The other eight consist of a rosette, also bearing the motto \"Benefit, Honor and Glory.\" At the inauguration of Vladimir Putin, the emblem was placed on a red pillow, positioned on the left side of the podium. According to the Presidential website, the emblem is placed inside the Kremlin and is used only on certain occasions.\n\n===Standard (flag)===\nThe standard is a square version of the [[Flag of Russia|Russian flag]], charged in the center with the Russian coat of arms. Golden fringe is added to the standard. Copies of the standard are used inside his office, at the Kremlin, other state agencies, and while the president is traveling in a vehicle inside Russia. A 2:3 ratio version of the flag is used when the President is at sea. This is the most used symbol to denote the presence of the Russian President.\n\n===Special copy of the Constitution===\nThe President also has a special copy of the [[Constitution of Russia|Russian Constitution]] that is used during the inauguration. This copy has a hard, red cover with gold lettering. An image of the Russian coat of arms appears in silver. The special copy is kept in the Presidential Library.\n\n===Legal basis of the insignia===\nThese insignia and the procedure were established by the [[Decree of the President of Russia|presidential decree]] 1138 from 5 August 1996,<ref>Co\u0431pa\u043d\u0438e \u0437a\u043ao\u043do\u0434a\u0442e\u043b\u044cc\u0442\u0432a \u0420occ\u0438\u0439c\u043ao\u0439 \u0424e\u0434epa\u0446\u0438\u0438 1996, \u211633, ar. 3976</ref> and modified by decree 832 from 6 May 2000.<ref>Co\u0431pa\u043d\u0438e \u0437a\u043ao\u043do\u0434a\u0442e\u043b\u044cc\u0442\u0432a \u0420occ\u0438\u0439c\u043ao\u0439 \u0424e\u0434epa\u0446\u0438\u0438 2000, \u211619, ar. 2068</ref> In the new decree the special copy of the Constitution was removed as the third symbol of the Russian Presidency; the other two symbols remained intact because they were and are regulated by separate decrees. Nonetheless, the special copy of the Constitution still exists and serves for inauguration purposes only without being officially presented as a symbol of the Russian Presidency.\n\n==Powers and duties==\n[[File:Fanfares of President of the Russian Federation.ogg|thumb|The Presidential Fanfare.]]\n[[File:Address to the Federal Assembly (2012-12-12) - 09.jpeg|upright=1.15|thumb|President Vladimir Putin delivering the 2012 [[Presidential Address to the Federal Assembly (Russia)|Address to the Federal Assembly]]]]\n\n===Guarantor of the Constitution===\nAs the guarantor of the Constitution and the entire system of constitutional law, the President ensures that the constitutions, laws and regulations of the constituent territories of the Russian Federation be in full compliance with the country's Constitution and federal laws.\n\n===Nominations===\nThe President is highly active in appointing top officials in the country. He nominates candidates for official state positions, who must ultimately be appointed based on parliamentary vote. The President submits nominations to the [[Federation Council of Russia|Federation Council]], the [[upper house]] of [[Federal Assembly of Russia|the parliament]], for judges of the [[Constitutional Court]], the [[Supreme Court of Russia|Supreme Court]] and the [[Supreme Arbitration Court of Russia|Supreme Arbitration Court]], as well as for [[Prosecutor General of Russia]]. A proposal to relieve the Prosecutor General of his duties must also be submitted to the Federation Council. The President submits to the [[State Duma]], the [[lower house]] of parliament, nominations for appointment to the office of the Chairman of the [[Central Bank of Russia|Central Bank]], and likewise submits to the State Duma any proposal to relieve the Chairman of the Central Bank of his duties.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://archive.kremlin.ru/eng/articles/president03.shtml |title=Authority and Duties of the President |publisher=Archive.kremlin.ru |accessdate=3 March 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140210072025/http://archive.kremlin.ru/eng/articles/president03.shtml |archivedate=10 February 2014 |df=dmy }}</ref>\n\n===Legislation===\nUnder the procedure stipulated by the Constitution, the President exercises his [[Right of initiative (legislative)|right to submit draft legislation]], as well as the right to [[sign into law|sign bills into law]] or to [[veto]] them.\n\nThe President has the right to suspend laws and [[regulation]]s issued by executive bodies of Russia's constituent territories if such laws and regulations contravene the Constitution, federal laws or international obligations of the Russian Federation, or violate [[human rights in Russia|human]] and [[civil rights]] and liberties, pending the resolution of the issue in an appropriate court.\n\nThe President can [[Decree of the President of Russia|issue by-laws by decree]], so long as such decrees are not in contradiction with existing laws (both local and federal), Russia's international agreements or the Russian Constitution.\n\nThe President is further empowered to grant federal [[Pardon#Russia|pardons]] and reprieves, and to convene and adjourn either or both houses of the [[Federal Assembly (Russia)|Federal Assembly]] under extraordinary circumstances.\n\nOther powers of the President in the sphere of legal activities and in his interaction with the Parliament include calling [[Elections in Russia|elections]] to the State Duma, [[Dissolving parliament#Russia|dissolving the State Duma]] in certain cases, and calling [[referendum]].\n\n===Domestic policy===\nUnder the Constitution, the President is not empowered to determine the full range of short-, middle-, and long-term objectives and targets of domestic policy, but only its basic guidelines. In practice, he determines it with the Prime Minister and the Government of the Federation. They are to be implemented both by the President himself and by the [[Government of Russia]] within the bounds of their authority. The President\u2019 fundamental positions on domestic policy issues are expressed in his written decisions regarding draft federal constitutional laws and draft federal laws, as well as his letters explaining the reasons for rejecting draft federal laws.\n\nWithin the bounds of the authority granted to the head of state by the Constitution and other laws, the President also shapes the basic domestic policy guidelines by issuing legal regulations and through organizational and regulatory activity, such as issuing decrees and executive orders. Each year the President is required to make an Address to the Federal Assembly regarding the situation in the country and the internal and foreign policy of the state.\n\n===Foreign policy===\n[[File:Dmitry Medvedev and Barack Obama 7 July-3.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|Then-President [[Dmitry Medvedev]] with Then-[[US President]] [[Barack Obama]] in 2009.]]\nThe President is invested with extensive rights to implement the state's foreign policy. The President determines [[Foreign relations of Russia|Russia's position in international affairs]], along with the Prime Minister and the Government of the Federation, and represents the state in international relations, conducts negotiations and signs [[ratification]] documents. The President appoints and recalls [[diplomatic representative]]s of Russia to foreign states and [[international organization]]s. These appointments are preceded by consultations with the respective committees or commissions of the [[bicameralism|two houses]] of the Federal Assembly. The President signs [[international treaty|international treaties]].\n\n===Ceremonial duties===\nAn important ceremonial role of the President is awarding state awards. [[List of orders, decorations, and medals of the Russian Federation|State Awards of the Russian Federation]] are the highest form of official recognition given to individuals for service to the nation in the fields of defense, state-building, economics, science, culture, art, education, health care, public safety, rights advocacy and charity. The state awards of the Russian Federation include the title of [[Hero of the Russian Federation]], [[Hero of Labour of the Russian Federation]] as well as orders, medals, emblems and honorary titles. New state honors and awards can be established by the President, who also presents these honors to the recipients in an official ceremony. A Commission for State Honors, which works on a voluntary basis, helps the President to objectively assess potential recipients.\n\n==Residences==\n[[File:Kremlin Senate-1.jpg|upright=0.9|thumb|left|[[Kremlin Senate]], is the working residence of the President of Russia]]\n[[File:2018 inauguration of Vladimir Putin 05.jpg|upright=1.35|right|thumb|Vladimir Putin in Presidential Cabinet]]\n\nThe primary working President's residence is the [[Kremlin Senate|Senate building]] (also known as 1st building) in the [[Moscow Kremlin]] complex.<ref name=\"residences\">[http://www.kremlin.ru/eng/articles/atributesEng09.shtml The Presidential Residences] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090828095301/http://www.kremlin.ru/eng/articles/atributesEng09.shtml |date=28 August 2009 }}</ref> Also the President can use the [[Grand Kremlin Palace]] (used for official ceremonies and meetings).

On 11 November 1999 Prime Minister Vladimir Putin signed a decree on the implementation of the amended decree of 15 June 1999.\n\nOn 31 December 1999, the day of the resignation of Boris Yeltsin, the president issued a decree \"On guarantees of the Russian Federation President, stop exercising his powers, and his family,\" and the eponymous federal law was adopted by 25 January 2001.\n\nThis law establishes the legal, social and other guarantees of the Russian Federation President, stops the execution of its powers in connection with the expiration of his term of office or in advance in the event of his resignation or permanent incapacity for health reasons to exercise the powers belonging to him and his family:\n\n*President of Russia, ceased to carry out its mandate, regardless of age, is entitled to a monthly lifetime pay of 75% of the monthly remuneration of the President of Russia.\n*In the case of the President's death his family members are entitled to a monthly allowance in the amount equal to six times the minimum old-age pension, established by the federal law on the day of his death.\n*President of Russia, ceased to carry out its mandate, has immunity.

These and community acceptance were the more important factors if a person's racial status were questioned, not his or her documented ancestry. Because of the [[social mobility]] of antebellum society in frontier areas, many people did not have documentation about their ancestors anyway.\n\nBased on late 20th-century [[DNA]] analysis and a preponderance of historical evidence, [[Thomas Jefferson]] is widely believed to have fathered the six [[mixed-race]] children with his slave [[Sally Hemings]], who was herself three-quarters white. Four of these children, who were seven-eighths white, survived to adulthood. Hemings was a half-sister of [[Martha Jefferson|Martha Wayles Jefferson]].{{#tag:ref|\"Ten years later [referring to its 2000 report], TJF [Thomas Jefferson Foundation] and most historians now believe that, years after his wife's death, Thomas Jefferson was the father of the six children of Sally Hemings mentioned in Jefferson's records, including Beverly, Harriet, Madison and Eston Hemings.\"<ref name=\"Sally Hemings 2011\">[http://www.monticello.org/plantation/hemingscontro/hemings-jefferson_contro.html \"Thomas Jefferson and Sally Hemings: A Brief Account\"], Monticello Website, accessed 22 June 2011.</ref>|group=\"quote\"}} Their children were born into slavery because of her status; as they were seven-eighths European in ancestry, they were legally white under Virginia law of the time.<ref name=\"Sally Hemings 2011\"/> Jefferson allowed the two oldest to escape in 1822 (freeing them legally was a public action he elected to avoid because he would have had to gain permission from the state legislature); the two youngest he freed in his 1826 will. Three of the four entered white society as adults, and all their descendants identified as white.<ref name=\"Sally Hemings 2011\"/>\n\nAlthough [[racial segregation]] was adopted legally by southern states of the former Confederacy in the late 19th century, legislators resisted defining race by law as part of preventing interracial marriages. In 1895 in [[South Carolina]] during discussion, [[George D. Tillman]] said,\n<blockquote>It is a scientific fact that there is not one full-blooded Caucasian on the floor of this convention. Every member has in him a certain mixture of... colored blood...It would be a cruel injustice and the source of endless litigation, of scandal, horror, feud, and bloodshed to undertake to annul or forbid marriage for a remote, perhaps obsolete trace of Negro blood.

This was largely due to the majority of the early colonists being male. As many [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] tribes had matrilineal kinship systems, they considered the children to be born to the mother's family and clan. If they were raised in the culture, they were considered members of the community, and therefore, fully Native American. \n\nPrior to colonization, and still in traditional communities, the idea of determining belonging by degree of \"blood\" was, and is, unheard of. Native American tribes did not use blood quantum law until the [[United States government|government]] introduced the [[Indian Reorganization Act of 1934]], instead determining tribal status on the basis of kinship, lineage and family ties.<ref name=Tallbear1>{{cite journal|author=Kimberly Tallbear |title=DNA, Blood, and Racializing the Tribe|journal=Wicazo Sa Review|date= 2003 |volume=18 |issue=1 |pages=81\u2013107 |publisher=University of Minnesota Press |jstor=140943|doi=10.1353/wic.2003.0008}}</ref>\n\nAmong [[patrilineal]] tribes, such as the [[Omaha people|Omaha]], historically a child born to an Omaha mother and a white father could belong officially to the Omaha tribe only if the child were formally adopted into it by a male citizen.{{#tag:ref|In 1855, John Bigelk, nephew of Big Elk, described a Sioux attack in which the [[mixed-race]] man [[Logan Fontenelle]], son of an Omaha woman and a French trader, was killed: \"They killed the white man, the interpreter, who was with us.\" As the historian Melvin Randolph Gilmore noted, Bigelk called Fontenelle \"a white man because he had a white father.

The poet [[Langston Hughes]] wrote in his 1940 memoir:\n\n{{quote|You see, unfortunately, I am not black. There are lots of different kinds of blood in our family. But here in the United States, the word 'Negro' is used to mean anyone who has any Negro blood at all in his veins. In Africa, the word is more pure. It means all Negro, therefore black.

Sociologically, however, the concept remains somewhat pervasive. Some African Americans turned it around, claiming people of African descent in order to strengthen their political unity when working on activism for civil rights and legislation. Research has shown that some white people associate bi-racial children with the non-white ancestry of the individual.<ref name=Davis/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2010/12/one-drop-rule-persists/|title='One-drop rule' persists|date=2010-12-09}}</ref>\n\n==Legislation and practice==\nBoth before and after the [[American Civil War]], many people of mixed ancestry who \"looked white\" and were of mostly white ancestry were legally absorbed into the white majority. State laws established differing standards. For instance, an 1822 Virginia law stated that to be defined as [[mulatto]] (that is, multi-racial), a person had to have at least one-quarter (equivalent to one grandparent) African ancestry.{{#tag:ref|\"To be defined as 'mulatto' under Virginia law in 1822, a person had to have at least one-quarter African ancestry.\" (This is the equivalent to one grandparent.)<ref name=Rothman/>{{rp|68}}|group=\"quote\"}} Social acceptance and identity were historically the keys to racial identity. Virginia's one-fourth standard remained in place until 1910, when the standard was changed to one sixteenth. In 1924, under the [[Racial Integrity Act]], even the one sixteenth standard was abandoned in favor of a more stringent standard. The act defined a person as legally \"colored\" (black) for classification and legal purposes if the individual had ''any'' African ancestry.\n\nAlthough the Virginia legislature increased restrictions on free blacks following the [[Nat Turner Rebellion]] of 1831, it refrained from establishing a one-drop rule. When a proposal was made by [[Travis H. Eppes]] and debated in 1853, representatives realized that such a rule could adversely affect whites, as they were aware of [[First Families of Virginia#Pocahontas|generations of interracial relationships]]. During the debate, a person wrote to the [[Charlottesville, Virginia|Charlottesville]] newspaper:\n\n{{quote|[If a one-drop rule were adopted], I doubt not, if many who are reputed to be white, and are in fact so, do not in a very short time find themselves instead of being elevated, reduced by the judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction, to the level of a free negro.<ref name=Rothman/>{{rp|230}} }}\n\nThe state legislators agreed. No such law was passed until 1924, apparently assisted by the fading recollection of such mixed familial histories. In the 21st century, such interracial family histories are being revealed as individuals undergo DNA genetic analysis.\n\nThe [[Melungeons]] are a group of multiracial families of mostly European and African ancestry whose ancestors were free in colonial Virginia. They migrated to the frontier in Kentucky and Tennessee. Their descendants have been documented over the decades as having tended to marry persons classified as \"white\".<ref>[http://freeafricanamericans.com Paul Heinegg, ''Free African Americans in Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Maryland and Delaware'', 1999\u20132005].</ref> Their descendants became assimilated into the majority culture from the 19th to the 20th centuries.\n\nPursuant to Reconstruction later in the 19th century, southern states acted to impose racial segregation by law and restrict the liberties of blacks, specifically passing laws to exclude them from politics and voting. From 1890 to 1908, all of the former Confederate states passed such laws, and most preserved disfranchisement until after passage of federal civil rights laws in the 1960s. At the South Carolina constitutional convention in 1895, an anti-[[miscegenation]] law and changes that would [[Disfranchisement after the Reconstruction Era|disfranchise]] blacks were proposed. Delegates debated a proposal for a one-drop rule to include in these laws. [[George D. Tillman]] said the following in opposition:\n\n{{quote|If the law is made as it now stands respectable families in Aiken, Barnwell, Colleton, and Orangeburg will be denied the right to intermarry among people with whom they are now associated and identified. At least one hundred families would be affected to my knowledge. They have sent good soldiers to the Confederate Army, and are now landowners and taxpayers. Those men served creditably, and it would be unjust and disgraceful to embarrass them in this way. It is a scientific fact that there is not one full-blooded Caucasian on the floor of this convention. Every member has in him a certain mixture of&nbsp;... colored blood. The pure-blooded white has needed and received a certain infusion of darker blood to give him readiness and purpose. It would be a cruel injustice and the source of endless litigation, of scandal, horror, feud, and bloodshed to undertake to annul or forbid marriage for a remote, perhaps obsolete trace of Negro blood. The doors would be open to scandal, malice, and greed; to statements on the witness stand that the father or grandfather or grandmother had said that A or B had Negro blood in their veins. Any man who is half a man would be ready to blow up half the world with dynamite to prevent or avenge attacks upon the honor of his mother in the legitimacy or purity of the blood of his father.<ref name=\"courier\">\"All Niggers, More or Less!\", ''The News and Courier'', October 17, 1895.</ref><ref>Joel Williamson, ''New People: Miscegenation and Mulattoes in the United States'' (New York, 1980), p. 93.</ref>}}\n\nIn 1865, Florida passed an act that both outlawed miscegenation and defined the amount of Black ancestry needed to be legally defined as a \"person of color\". The act stated that \"every person who shall have one-eighth or more of negro blood shall be deemed and held to be a person of color.\" (This was the equivalent of one great-grandparent.) Additionally, the act outlawed fornication, as well as the intermarrying of white females with men of color. However, the act permitted the continuation of marriages between white persons and persons of color that were established before the law was enacted.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=kAI4AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA30&lpg=PA30&dq=Laws+of+the+State+of+Florida,+First+Session+of+the+Fourteenth+General+Assembly+Under+the+Amended+Constitution+1865-6&source=bl&ots=itF_t21WYg&sig=kLxpaFDXlBW6JaPj95kS972f5iQ&hl=en&sa=X&ei=21o7UqTEHLaz4AOR7IG4CA&ved=0CDAQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=Laws%20of%20the%20State%20of%20Florida%2C%20First%20Session%20of%20the%20Fourteenth%20General%20Assembly%20Under%20the%20Amended%20Constitution%201865-6&f=false ''Laws of the State of Florida, First Session of the Fourteenth General Assembly Under the Amended Constitution 1865\u2013'6''].

This was decades after the Civil War, [[abolitionism in the United States|emancipation]], and the [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]] era. It followed restoration of [[white supremacy]] in the South and the passage of [[Jim Crow]] [[racial segregation]] laws. In the 20th century, it was also associated with the rise of [[eugenics]] and ideas of [[racial purity]].{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} From the late 1870s on, white [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] regained political power in the former Confederate states and passed racial [[Racial segregation in the United States|segregation]] laws controlling public facilities, and laws and constitutions from 1890 to 1910 to achieve disfranchisement of most blacks. Many poor whites were also disfranchised in these years, by changes to voter registration rules that worked against them, such as [[literacy tests]], longer residency requirements and [[poll tax (United States)|poll taxes]].\n\nThe first challenges to such state laws were overruled by [[United States Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] decisions which upheld state constitutions that effectively disfranchised many. White Democratic-dominated legislatures proceeded with passing [[Jim Crow laws]] that instituted racial segregation in public places and accommodations, and passed other restrictive voting legislation. In ''[[Plessy v. Ferguson]]'', the Supreme Court allowed racial segregation of public facilities, under the \"separate but equal\" doctrine.\n\nJim Crow laws reached their greatest influence during the decades from 1910 to 1930. Among them were hypodescent laws, defining as black anyone with any black ancestry, or with a very small portion of black ancestry.<ref name=\"highered.mcgraw-hill\" /> [[Tennessee]] adopted such a \"one-drop\" statute in 1910, and [[Louisiana]] soon followed. Then [[Texas]] and [[Arkansas]] in 1911, [[Mississippi]] in 1917, [[North Carolina]] in 1923, [[Virginia]] in 1924, [[Alabama]] and [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] in 1927, and [[Oklahoma]] in 1931. During this same period, [[Florida]], [[Indiana]], [[Kentucky]], [[Maryland]], [[Missouri]], [[Nebraska]], [[North Dakota]], and [[Utah]] retained their old \"blood fraction\" statutes ''[[de jure]]'', but amended these fractions (one-sixteenth, one-thirty-second) to be equivalent to one-drop ''[[de facto]].''<ref>Pauli Murray, ed. ''States' Laws on Race and Color'' (Athens, 1997), 428, 173, 443, 37, 237, 330, 463, 22, 39, 358, 77, 150, 164, 207, 254, 263, 459.</ref>\n\nBefore 1930, individuals of visible mixed European and African ancestry were usually classed as [[mulatto]], or sometimes as black and sometimes as white, depending on appearance. Previously, most states had limited trying to define ancestry before \"the fourth degree\" (great-great-grandparents). But, in 1930, due to lobbying by southern legislators, the Census Bureau stopped using the classification of mulatto. Documentation of the long social recognition of [[mixed-race]] people was lost, and they were classified only as black or white.\n\nThe binary world of the one-drop rule disregarded the self-identification both of people of mostly European ancestry who grew up in white communities, and of people who were of mixed race and identified as American Indian. In addition, [[Walter Plecker]], Registrar of Statistics, ordered application of the 1924 Virginia law in such a way that vital records were changed or destroyed, family members were split on opposite sides of the color line, and there were losses of the documented continuity of people who identified as American Indian, as all people in Virginia had to be classified as white or black. Over the centuries, many Indian tribes in Virginia had absorbed people of other ethnicities through marriage or adoption, but maintained their cultures. Suspecting blacks of trying to \"[[Passing (racial identity)|pass]]\" as Indians, Plecker ordered records changed to classify people only as black or white, and ordered offices to reclassify certain family surnames from Indian to black.\n\nSince the late 20th century, Virginia has officially recognized eight American Indian tribes and their members; the tribes are trying to gain federal recognition. They have had difficulty because decades of birth, marriage, and death records were misclassified under Plecker's application of the law. No one was classified as Indian, although many individuals and families identified that way and were preserving their cultures.\n\nIn the case of mixed-race [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|American Indian]] and European descendants, the one-drop rule in Virginia was extended only so far as those with more than one-sixteenth Indian blood. This was due to what was known as \"[[Racial Integrity Act of 1924#The Pocahontas exception|the Pocahontas exception]]\". Since many influential [[First Families of Virginia]] (FFV) claimed descent from the American Indian [[Pocahontas]] and her husband [[John Rolfe]] of the colonial era, the [[Virginia General Assembly]] declared that an individual could be considered white if having no more than one-sixteenth Indian \"blood\" (the equivalent of one great-great-grandparent).\n\nThe [[eugenicist]] [[Madison Grant]] of New York wrote in his book, ''[[The Passing of the Great Race]]'' (1916): \"The cross between a white man and an [[Native Americans in the United States|Indian]] is an Indian; the cross between a white man and a Negro is a Negro; the cross between a white man and a [[Historical definitions of races in India|Hindu]] is a Hindu; and the cross between any of the three European races and a [[Jew]] is a Jew.\"<ref>Madison Grant, ''The Passing of the Great Race'', 1916.</ref> As noted above, Native American tribes such as the Omaha, which had patrilineal descent and inheritance, used hypodescent to classify the children of white men and Native American women as white.\n\n==Plecker case==\n{{Main|Walter Plecker}}\nThrough the 1940s, [[Walter Plecker]] of Virginia<ref>For the Plecker story, see {{cite journal | last1 = Smith | first1 = J.

As the Registrar of Statistics, Plecker insisted on labeling mixed-race families of European-African ancestry as black. In 1924, Plecker wrote, \"Two races as materially divergent as the White and Negro, in morals, mental powers, and cultural fitness, cannot live in close contact without injury to the higher.\" In the 1930s and 1940s, Plecker directed offices under his authority to change vital records and reclassify certain families as black (or colored) (without notifying them) after Virginia established a binary system under its Racial Integrity Act of 1924. He also classified people as black who had formerly self-identified as Indian. When the United States Supreme Court struck down Virginia's law prohibiting inter-racial marriage in ''[[Loving v. Virginia]]'' (1967), it also declared Plecker's [[Racial Integrity Act of 1924|Virginia Racial Integrity Act]] and the one-drop rule unconstitutional.\n\nMany people in the U.S., among various ethnic groups, continue to have their own concepts related to the one-drop idea. They may still consider those multiracial individuals with any African ancestry to be black, or at least non-white (if the person has other minority ancestry), unless the person explicitly identifies as white. On the other hand, the [[Black Power Movement]] and some leaders within the black community also claimed as black those persons with any visible African ancestry, in order to extend their political base and regardless of how those people self-identified. The number of self-identified multi-racial people in the US is increasing.\n\n==Other countries of the Americas==\n{{Main|Race and ethnicity in Latin America}}\n[[File:Condoleezza Rice Colin Powell George W.

Bush|Bush]] and [[Donald Rumsfeld|Rumsfeld]] (on the right) are considered white.]]\nAmong the colonial slave societies, the United States was nearly unique in developing the one-drop rule; it derived both from the Southern slave culture (shared by other societies) and the aftermath of the [[American Civil War]], [[abolitionism in the United States|emancipation]] of slaves, and [[Reconstruction Era of the United States|Reconstruction]]. In the late 19th century, Southern whites regained political power and restored [[white supremacy]], passing [[Jim Crow]] laws and establishing [[racial segregation]] by law. In the 20th century, during the Black Power Movement, black race-based groups claimed all people of any African ancestry as black in a reverse way, to establish political power.\n\nIn colonial [[Hispanic America|Spanish America]], many soldiers and explorers took [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous]] women as wives. Native-born Spanish women were always a minority. The colonists developed an elaborate classification and [[Casta|caste system]] that identified the mixed-race descendants of blacks, [[Amerindian]]s, and whites by different names, related to appearance and known ancestry. Racial caste not only depended on ancestry or skin color, but also could be raised or lowered by the person's financial status or class.\n\n[[File:Lena Horne - 1941.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Lena Horne]] was reportedly descended from the [[John C. Calhoun]] family, and both sides of her family were a mixture of [[African-American]], [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]], and [[European American]] descent.]]\nThe same racial culture shock has come to hundreds of thousands of dark-skinned immigrants to the United States from Brazil, [[Colombia]], [[Panama]], and other Latin American nations. Although many are not considered black in their homelands, they have often been considered black in US society. According to ''The Washington Post'', their refusal to accept the United States' definition of black has left many feeling attacked from all directions. At times, white and black Americans might discriminate against them for their lighter or darker skin tones; African Americans might believe that [[Afro-Latin American|Afro-Latino]] immigrants are denying their blackness. At the same time, the immigrants think [[White Hispanic and Latino Americans|lighter-skinned Latinos]] dominate [[Television in the United States#Broadcast television in non-English languages|Spanish-language television]] and media. A majority of [[Latin Americans]] possess some African or American Indian ancestry. Many of these immigrants feel it is difficult enough to accept a new language and culture without the additional burden of having to transform from white to black. Yvette Modestin, a dark-skinned native of Panama who worked in [[Boston]], said the situation was overwhelming: \"There's not a day that I don't have to explain myself.\"<ref name=WPost/>\n\nProfessor J.B. Bird has said that Latin America is not alone in rejecting the historical US notion that any visible African ancestry is enough to make one black:\n<blockquote>In most countries of the Caribbean, [[Colin Powell]] would be described as a [[Creole peoples#Caribbean|Creole]], reflecting his mixed heritage. In [[Belize]], he might further be described as a \"High Creole\", because of his extremely light complexion.<ref>[http://www.johnhorse.com/black-seminoles/faq-black-seminoles.htm FAQ on the Black Seminoles, John Horse, and Rebellion<!-- Bot generated title -->].</ref></blockquote>These examples show that the perception of race is relative to different societies and individuals.\n\n===Brazil===\n{{See also|Race in Brazil}}\n[[File:Reden\u00e7\u00e3o.jpg|thumb|250px|left|''A Reden\u00e7\u00e3o de Cam'' (''[[Curse of Ham|Redemption of Ham]]''), [[Modesto Brocos]], 1895, [[Museu Nacional de Belas Artes]]. The painting depicts a black grandmother, mulatta mother, white father and their [[quadroon]] child, hence three generations of [[hypergamy]] through [[racial whitening]].]]\nPeople in many other countries have tended to treat race less rigidly, both in their self-identification and how they regard others. Just as a person with physically recognizable African ancestry can claim to be black in the United States, someone with recognizable [[Caucasian race|Caucasian]] ancestry may be considered white in [[Brazil]], even if mixed race.\n\nIn December 2002, ''[[The Washington Post]]'' ran a story on the one-drop rule and differences in Latin American practices. In the reporter's opinion:\n<blockquote>Someone with [[Sidney Poitier]]'s deep chocolate complexion would be considered white if his hair were straight and he made a living in a profession.

Mixed-race children of white mothers were born free, and many families of free people of color were started in those years. 80 percent of the free African-American families in the Upper South in the censuses of 1790 to 1810 can be traced as descendants of unions between white women and African men in colonial Virginia, not of slave women and white men. In the early colony, conditions were loose among the working class, who lived and worked closely together. After the [[American Revolutionary War]], their free mixed-race descendants migrated to the frontiers of nearby states along with other primarily European Virginia pioneers.<ref>Paul Heinegg, [http://www.freeafricanamericans.com ''Free African Americans in Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Maryland and Delaware''], 1999\u20132005.</ref> The admixture also reflects later conditions under slavery, when white planters or their sons, or overseers, frequently raped African women.<ref>Moon, Dannell, \"Slavery\", in ''Encyclopedia of Rape,'' Merril D.

For example, he found that the black populations with the highest percentage of white ancestry lived in California and Seattle, Washington. These were both majority-white destinations during the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]] of 1940\u20131970 of African Americans from the Deep South of Louisiana, Texas and Mississippi.

The American [[musical theatre|musical]] ''[[Show Boat]]'' (1927) opens in 1887 on a Mississippi River boat, after the Reconstruction era and imposition of [[racial segregation]] and [[Jim Crow]] in the South. Steve, a white man married to a mixed-race woman who [[passing (racial identity)|passes]] as white, is pursued by a Southern sheriff. He intends to arrest Steve and charge him with [[miscegenation]] for being married to a woman of partly black ancestry. Steve pricks his wife's finger and swallows some of her blood. When the sheriff arrives, Steve asks him whether he would consider a man to be white if he had \"negro blood\" in him. The sheriff replies that \"one drop of Negro blood makes you a Negro in these parts\". Steve tells the sheriff that he has \"more than a drop of negro blood in me\". After being assured by others that Steve is telling the truth, the sheriff leaves without arresting Steve.<ref name=tcm>[http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title.jsp?scarlettTitleId=14440 ''Show Boat'' (1951) Overview], Turner Classic Movies.

In the [[History of the United States (1789\u20131849)|antebellum]] years, free people of mixed race ([[free people of color]]) were considered legally white if individuals had less than one-eighth or [[quadroon|one-quarter African ancestry]] (depending on the state).<ref name=Rothman>Joshua D.

These and community acceptance were the more important factors if a person's racial status were questioned, not his or her documented ancestry. Because of the [[social mobility]] of antebellum society in frontier areas, many people did not have documentation about their ancestors anyway.\n\nBased on late 20th-century [[DNA]] analysis and a preponderance of historical evidence, [[Thomas Jefferson]] is widely believed to have fathered the six [[mixed-race]] children with his slave [[Sally Hemings]], who was herself three-quarters white. Four of these children, who were seven-eighths white, survived to adulthood. Hemings was a half-sister of [[Martha Jefferson|Martha Wayles Jefferson]].{{#tag:ref|\"Ten years later [referring to its 2000 report], TJF [Thomas Jefferson Foundation] and most historians now believe that, years after his wife's death, Thomas Jefferson was the father of the six children of Sally Hemings mentioned in Jefferson's records, including Beverly, Harriet, Madison and Eston Hemings.\"<ref name=\"Sally Hemings 2011\">[http://www.monticello.org/plantation/hemingscontro/hemings-jefferson_contro.html \"Thomas Jefferson and Sally Hemings: A Brief Account\"], Monticello Website, accessed 22 June 2011.</ref>|group=\"quote\"}} Their children were born into slavery because of her status; as they were seven-eighths European in ancestry, they were legally white under Virginia law of the time.<ref name=\"Sally Hemings 2011\"/> Jefferson allowed the two oldest to escape in 1822 (freeing them legally was a public action he elected to avoid because he would have had to gain permission from the state legislature); the two youngest he freed in his 1826 will.

In 1895 in [[South Carolina]] during discussion, [[George D. Tillman]] said,\n<blockquote>It is a scientific fact that there is not one full-blooded Caucasian on the floor of this convention. Every member has in him a certain mixture of... colored blood...It would be a cruel injustice and the source of endless litigation, of scandal, horror, feud, and bloodshed to undertake to annul or forbid marriage for a remote, perhaps obsolete trace of Negro blood.

This was largely due to the majority of the early colonists being male. As many [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] tribes had matrilineal kinship systems, they considered the children to be born to the mother's family and clan. If they were raised in the culture, they were considered members of the community, and therefore, fully Native American. \n\nPrior to colonization, and still in traditional communities, the idea of determining belonging by degree of \"blood\" was, and is, unheard of. Native American tribes did not use blood quantum law until the [[United States government|government]] introduced the [[Indian Reorganization Act of 1934]], instead determining tribal status on the basis of kinship, lineage and family ties.<ref name=Tallbear1>{{cite journal|author=Kimberly Tallbear |title=DNA, Blood, and Racializing the Tribe|journal=Wicazo Sa Review|date= 2003 |volume=18 |issue=1 |pages=81\u2013107 |publisher=University of Minnesota Press |jstor=140943|doi=10.1353/wic.2003.0008}}</ref>\n\nAmong [[patrilineal]] tribes, such as the [[Omaha people|Omaha]], historically a child born to an Omaha mother and a white father could belong officially to the Omaha tribe only if the child were formally adopted into it by a male citizen.{{#tag:ref|In 1855, John Bigelk, nephew of Big Elk, described a Sioux attack in which the [[mixed-race]] man [[Logan Fontenelle]], son of an Omaha woman and a French trader, was killed: \"They killed the white man, the interpreter, who was with us.\" As the historian Melvin Randolph Gilmore noted, Bigelk called Fontenelle \"a white man because he had a white father.

The poet [[Langston Hughes]] wrote in his 1940 memoir:\n\n{{quote|You see, unfortunately, I am not black. There are lots of different kinds of blood in our family. But here in the United States, the word 'Negro' is used to mean anyone who has any Negro blood at all in his veins. In Africa, the word is more pure. It means all Negro, therefore black. I am brown.<ref>Langston Hughes, ''The Big Sea, an Autobiography'' (New York: Knopf, 1940).</ref>}}\n\nThis rule meant many mixed-race people, of diverse ancestry, were simply seen as African-American, and their more diverse ancestors forgotten and erased, making it difficult to accurately trace ancestry in the present day. \n\nMany descendants of those who were enslaved and trafficked by Europeans and Americans have assumed they have [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] ancestry. In 2006 [[Henry Louis Gates Jr.]]'s 2006 [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] documentary on the genetic makeup of African Americans, ''[[African American Lives]]'', focused on these stories of Native American heritage in African-American communities.

Sociologically, however, the concept remains somewhat pervasive. Some African Americans turned it around, claiming people of African descent in order to strengthen their political unity when working on activism for civil rights and legislation. Research has shown that some white people associate bi-racial children with the non-white ancestry of the individual.<ref name=Davis/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2010/12/one-drop-rule-persists/|title='One-drop rule' persists|date=2010-12-09}}</ref>\n\n==Legislation and practice==\nBoth before and after the [[American Civil War]], many people of mixed ancestry who \"looked white\" and were of mostly white ancestry were legally absorbed into the white majority. State laws established differing standards. For instance, an 1822 Virginia law stated that to be defined as [[mulatto]] (that is, multi-racial), a person had to have at least one-quarter (equivalent to one grandparent) African ancestry.{{#tag:ref|\"To be defined as 'mulatto' under Virginia law in 1822, a person had to have at least one-quarter African ancestry.\" (This is the equivalent to one grandparent.)<ref name=Rothman/>{{rp|68}}|group=\"quote\"}} Social acceptance and identity were historically the keys to racial identity. Virginia's one-fourth standard remained in place until 1910, when the standard was changed to one sixteenth. In 1924, under the [[Racial Integrity Act]], even the one sixteenth standard was abandoned in favor of a more stringent standard. The act defined a person as legally \"colored\" (black) for classification and legal purposes if the individual had ''any'' African ancestry.\n\nAlthough the Virginia legislature increased restrictions on free blacks following the [[Nat Turner Rebellion]] of 1831, it refrained from establishing a one-drop rule. When a proposal was made by [[Travis H. Eppes]] and debated in 1853, representatives realized that such a rule could adversely affect whites, as they were aware of [[First Families of Virginia#Pocahontas|generations of interracial relationships]]. During the debate, a person wrote to the [[Charlottesville, Virginia|Charlottesville]] newspaper:\n\n{{quote|[If a one-drop rule were adopted], I doubt not, if many who are reputed to be white, and are in fact so, do not in a very short time find themselves instead of being elevated, reduced by the judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction, to the level of a free negro.<ref name=Rothman/>{{rp|230}} }}\n\nThe state legislators agreed. No such law was passed until 1924, apparently assisted by the fading recollection of such mixed familial histories. In the 21st century, such interracial family histories are being revealed as individuals undergo DNA genetic analysis.\n\nThe [[Melungeons]] are a group of multiracial families of mostly European and African ancestry whose ancestors were free in colonial Virginia. They migrated to the frontier in Kentucky and Tennessee. Their descendants have been documented over the decades as having tended to marry persons classified as \"white\".<ref>[http://freeafricanamericans.com Paul Heinegg, ''Free African Americans in Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Maryland and Delaware'', 1999\u20132005].</ref> Their descendants became assimilated into the majority culture from the 19th to the 20th centuries.\n\nPursuant to Reconstruction later in the 19th century, southern states acted to impose racial segregation by law and restrict the liberties of blacks, specifically passing laws to exclude them from politics and voting. From 1890 to 1908, all of the former Confederate states passed such laws, and most preserved disfranchisement until after passage of federal civil rights laws in the 1960s. At the South Carolina constitutional convention in 1895, an anti-[[miscegenation]] law and changes that would [[Disfranchisement after the Reconstruction Era|disfranchise]] blacks were proposed. Delegates debated a proposal for a one-drop rule to include in these laws. [[George D. Tillman]] said the following in opposition:\n\n{{quote|If the law is made as it now stands respectable families in Aiken, Barnwell, Colleton, and Orangeburg will be denied the right to intermarry among people with whom they are now associated and identified. At least one hundred families would be affected to my knowledge. They have sent good soldiers to the Confederate Army, and are now landowners and taxpayers. Those men served creditably, and it would be unjust and disgraceful to embarrass them in this way. It is a scientific fact that there is not one full-blooded Caucasian on the floor of this convention. Every member has in him a certain mixture of&nbsp;... colored blood. The pure-blooded white has needed and received a certain infusion of darker blood to give him readiness and purpose.

The doors would be open to scandal, malice, and greed; to statements on the witness stand that the father or grandfather or grandmother had said that A or B had Negro blood in their veins.

The act stated that \"every person who shall have one-eighth or more of negro blood shall be deemed and held to be a person of color.\" (This was the equivalent of one great-grandparent.) Additionally, the act outlawed fornication, as well as the intermarrying of white females with men of color.

This was decades after the Civil War, [[abolitionism in the United States|emancipation]], and the [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]] era. It followed restoration of [[white supremacy]] in the South and the passage of [[Jim Crow]] [[racial segregation]] laws. In the 20th century, it was also associated with the rise of [[eugenics]] and ideas of [[racial purity]].{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} From the late 1870s on, white [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] regained political power in the former Confederate states and passed racial [[Racial segregation in the United States|segregation]] laws controlling public facilities, and laws and constitutions from 1890 to 1910 to achieve disfranchisement of most blacks. Many poor whites were also disfranchised in these years, by changes to voter registration rules that worked against them, such as [[literacy tests]], longer residency requirements and [[poll tax (United States)|poll taxes]].\n\nThe first challenges to such state laws were overruled by [[United States Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] decisions which upheld state constitutions that effectively disfranchised many. White Democratic-dominated legislatures proceeded with passing [[Jim Crow laws]] that instituted racial segregation in public places and accommodations, and passed other restrictive voting legislation. In ''[[Plessy v. Ferguson]]'', the Supreme Court allowed racial segregation of public facilities, under the \"separate but equal\" doctrine.\n\nJim Crow laws reached their greatest influence during the decades from 1910 to 1930. Among them were hypodescent laws, defining as black anyone with any black ancestry, or with a very small portion of black ancestry.<ref name=\"highered.mcgraw-hill\" /> [[Tennessee]] adopted such a \"one-drop\" statute in 1910, and [[Louisiana]] soon followed. Then [[Texas]] and [[Arkansas]] in 1911, [[Mississippi]] in 1917, [[North Carolina]] in 1923, [[Virginia]] in 1924, [[Alabama]] and [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] in 1927, and [[Oklahoma]] in 1931. During this same period, [[Florida]], [[Indiana]], [[Kentucky]], [[Maryland]], [[Missouri]], [[Nebraska]], [[North Dakota]], and [[Utah]] retained their old \"blood fraction\" statutes ''[[de jure]]'', but amended these fractions (one-sixteenth, one-thirty-second) to be equivalent to one-drop ''[[de facto]].''<ref>Pauli Murray, ed. ''States' Laws on Race and Color'' (Athens, 1997), 428, 173, 443, 37, 237, 330, 463, 22, 39, 358, 77, 150, 164, 207, 254, 263, 459.</ref>\n\nBefore 1930, individuals of visible mixed European and African ancestry were usually classed as [[mulatto]], or sometimes as black and sometimes as white, depending on appearance. Previously, most states had limited trying to define ancestry before \"the fourth degree\" (great-great-grandparents). But, in 1930, due to lobbying by southern legislators, the Census Bureau stopped using the classification of mulatto. Documentation of the long social recognition of [[mixed-race]] people was lost, and they were classified only as black or white.\n\nThe binary world of the one-drop rule disregarded the self-identification both of people of mostly European ancestry who grew up in white communities, and of people who were of mixed race and identified as American Indian. In addition, [[Walter Plecker]], Registrar of Statistics, ordered application of the 1924 Virginia law in such a way that vital records were changed or destroyed, family members were split on opposite sides of the color line, and there were losses of the documented continuity of people who identified as American Indian, as all people in Virginia had to be classified as white or black. Over the centuries, many Indian tribes in Virginia had absorbed people of other ethnicities through marriage or adoption, but maintained their cultures. Suspecting blacks of trying to \"[[Passing (racial identity)|pass]]\" as Indians, Plecker ordered records changed to classify people only as black or white, and ordered offices to reclassify certain family surnames from Indian to black.\n\nSince the late 20th century, Virginia has officially recognized eight American Indian tribes and their members; the tribes are trying to gain federal recognition. They have had difficulty because decades of birth, marriage, and death records were misclassified under Plecker's application of the law. No one was classified as Indian, although many individuals and families identified that way and were preserving their cultures.\n\nIn the case of mixed-race [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|American Indian]] and European descendants, the one-drop rule in Virginia was extended only so far as those with more than one-sixteenth Indian blood. This was due to what was known as \"[[Racial Integrity Act of 1924#The Pocahontas exception|the Pocahontas exception]]\". Since many influential [[First Families of Virginia]] (FFV) claimed descent from the American Indian [[Pocahontas]] and her husband [[John Rolfe]] of the colonial era, the [[Virginia General Assembly]] declared that an individual could be considered white if having no more than one-sixteenth Indian \"blood\" (the equivalent of one great-great-grandparent).\n\nThe [[eugenicist]] [[Madison Grant]] of New York wrote in his book, ''[[The Passing of the Great Race]]'' (1916): \"The cross between a white man and an [[Native Americans in the United States|Indian]] is an Indian; the cross between a white man and a Negro is a Negro; the cross between a white man and a [[Historical definitions of races in India|Hindu]] is a Hindu; and the cross between any of the three European races and a [[Jew]] is a Jew.\"<ref>Madison Grant, ''The Passing of the Great Race'', 1916.</ref> As noted above, Native American tribes such as the Omaha, which had patrilineal descent and inheritance, used hypodescent to classify the children of white men and Native American women as white.\n\n==Plecker case==\n{{Main|Walter Plecker}}\nThrough the 1940s, [[Walter Plecker]] of Virginia<ref>For the Plecker story, see {{cite journal | last1 = Smith | first1 = J.

As the Registrar of Statistics, Plecker insisted on labeling mixed-race families of European-African ancestry as black. In 1924, Plecker wrote, \"Two races as materially divergent as the White and Negro, in morals, mental powers, and cultural fitness, cannot live in close contact without injury to the higher.\" In the 1930s and 1940s, Plecker directed offices under his authority to change vital records and reclassify certain families as black (or colored) (without notifying them) after Virginia established a binary system under its Racial Integrity Act of 1924. He also classified people as black who had formerly self-identified as Indian. When the United States Supreme Court struck down Virginia's law prohibiting inter-racial marriage in ''[[Loving v. Virginia]]'' (1967), it also declared Plecker's [[Racial Integrity Act of 1924|Virginia Racial Integrity Act]] and the one-drop rule unconstitutional.\n\nMany people in the U.S., among various ethnic groups, continue to have their own concepts related to the one-drop idea. They may still consider those multiracial individuals with any African ancestry to be black, or at least non-white (if the person has other minority ancestry), unless the person explicitly identifies as white. On the other hand, the [[Black Power Movement]] and some leaders within the black community also claimed as black those persons with any visible African ancestry, in order to extend their political base and regardless of how those people self-identified. The number of self-identified multi-racial people in the US is increasing.\n\n==Other countries of the Americas==\n{{Main|Race and ethnicity in Latin America}}\n[[File:Condoleezza Rice Colin Powell George W. Bush Donald Rumsfeld.jpg|thumb|left|[[Condoleezza Rice|Rice]] and [[Colin Powell|Powell]] (on the left) are considered black in the US. [[George W. Bush|Bush]] and [[Donald Rumsfeld|Rumsfeld]] (on the right) are considered white.]]\nAmong the colonial slave societies, the United States was nearly unique in developing the one-drop rule; it derived both from the Southern slave culture (shared by other societies) and the aftermath of the [[American Civil War]], [[abolitionism in the United States|emancipation]] of slaves, and [[Reconstruction Era of the United States|Reconstruction]]. In the late 19th century, Southern whites regained political power and restored [[white supremacy]], passing [[Jim Crow]] laws and establishing [[racial segregation]] by law. In the 20th century, during the Black Power Movement, black race-based groups claimed all people of any African ancestry as black in a reverse way, to establish political power.\n\nIn colonial [[Hispanic America|Spanish America]], many soldiers and explorers took [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous]] women as wives. Native-born Spanish women were always a minority. The colonists developed an elaborate classification and [[Casta|caste system]] that identified the mixed-race descendants of blacks, [[Amerindian]]s, and whites by different names, related to appearance and known ancestry. Racial caste not only depended on ancestry or skin color, but also could be raised or lowered by the person's financial status or class.\n\n[[File:Lena Horne - 1941.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Lena Horne]] was reportedly descended from the [[John C. Calhoun]] family, and both sides of her family were a mixture of [[African-American]], [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]], and [[European American]] descent.]]\nThe same racial culture shock has come to hundreds of thousands of dark-skinned immigrants to the United States from Brazil, [[Colombia]], [[Panama]], and other Latin American nations. Although many are not considered black in their homelands, they have often been considered black in US society. According to ''The Washington Post'', their refusal to accept the United States' definition of black has left many feeling attacked from all directions. At times, white and black Americans might discriminate against them for their lighter or darker skin tones; African Americans might believe that [[Afro-Latin American|Afro-Latino]] immigrants are denying their blackness. At the same time, the immigrants think [[White Hispanic and Latino Americans|lighter-skinned Latinos]] dominate [[Television in the United States#Broadcast television in non-English languages|Spanish-language television]] and media. A majority of [[Latin Americans]] possess some African or American Indian ancestry. Many of these immigrants feel it is difficult enough to accept a new language and culture without the additional burden of having to transform from white to black. Yvette Modestin, a dark-skinned native of Panama who worked in [[Boston]], said the situation was overwhelming: \"There's not a day that I don't have to explain myself.\"<ref name=WPost/>\n\nProfessor J.B. Bird has said that Latin America is not alone in rejecting the historical US notion that any visible African ancestry is enough to make one black:\n<blockquote>In most countries of the Caribbean, [[Colin Powell]] would be described as a [[Creole peoples#Caribbean|Creole]], reflecting his mixed heritage. In [[Belize]], he might further be described as a \"High Creole\", because of his extremely light complexion.<ref>[http://www.johnhorse.com/black-seminoles/faq-black-seminoles.htm FAQ on the Black Seminoles, John Horse, and Rebellion<!-- Bot generated title -->].</ref></blockquote>These examples show that the perception of race is relative to different societies and individuals.\n\n===Brazil===\n{{See also|Race in Brazil}}\n[[File:Reden\u00e7\u00e3o.jpg|thumb|250px|left|''A Reden\u00e7\u00e3o de Cam'' (''[[Curse of Ham|Redemption of Ham]]''), [[Modesto Brocos]], 1895, [[Museu Nacional de Belas Artes]]. The painting depicts a black grandmother, mulatta mother, white father and their [[quadroon]] child, hence three generations of [[hypergamy]] through [[racial whitening]].]]\nPeople in many other countries have tended to treat race less rigidly, both in their self-identification and how they regard others. Just as a person with physically recognizable African ancestry can claim to be black in the United States, someone with recognizable [[Caucasian race|Caucasian]] ancestry may be considered white in [[Brazil]], even if mixed race.\n\nIn December 2002, ''[[The Washington Post]]'' ran a story on the one-drop rule and differences in Latin American practices. In the reporter's opinion:\n<blockquote>Someone with [[Sidney Poitier]]'s deep chocolate complexion would be considered white if his hair were straight and he made a living in a profession. That might not seem so odd, Brazilians say, when you consider that the fair-complexioned actresses [[Rashida Jones]] ('[[Parks and Recreation]]' and '[[The Office (U.S. TV series)|The Office]]') and [[Lena Horne]] are identified as black in the United States.<ref name=WPost>[https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/2002/12/26/people-of-color-who-never-felt-they-were-black/071e165f-48b7-4aaa-9d86-23e907cfbc7f/ \"People of Color Who Never Felt They Were Black\"] ''The Washington Post''.</ref></blockquote>\n\nAccording to Jose Neinstein, a native white Brazilian and executive director of the [[Brazilian American|Brazilian-American]] Cultural Institute in Washington, in the United States, \"If you are not quite white, then you are black.\" However, in Brazil, \"If you are not quite black, then you are white.\" Neinstein recalls talking with a man of Poitier's complexion when in Brazil: \"We were discussing ethnicity, and I asked him, 'What do you think about this from your perspective as a black man?' He turned his head to me and said, 'I'm not black,' ... It simply paralyzed me. I couldn't ask another question.\"<ref name=WPost/>\n\n===Puerto Rico===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Julio Voltio.jpg|thumb|right|Mixed-race Puerto Rican Reggaeton artist [[Julio Voltio]] is considered white in Puerto Rico, but may be considered black in the rest of the United States.]] -->\n\nDuring the Spanish colonial period, [[Puerto Rico]] had laws such as the ''Regla del Sacar'' or ''Gracias al Sacar,'' by which a person of black ancestry could be considered legally white so long as the individual could prove that at least one person per generation in the last four generations had also been legally white. Thus persons of black ancestry with known white lineage were classified as white, the opposite of the \"one-drop rule\" in the United States.<ref>Jay Kinsbruner, [https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&id=qLSU-SiojsYC&dq=Jay+Kinsbruner,+Not+of+Pure+Blood,&printsec=frontcover&source=web&ots=utW9BXA--9&sig=Sa7e_6rupXyUWxsgYWC4kL-1pew#PPP13,M1 ''Not of Pure Blood''], Duke University Press, 1996.</ref>\n\n==Racial mixtures of blacks and whites in modern America==\nGiven the intense interest in ethnicity, genetic [[genealogists]] and other scientists have studied population groups. [[Henry Louis Gates|Henry Louis Gates, Jr.]] publicized such genetic studies on his two series ''[[African American Lives]],'' shown on [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]], in which the ancestry of prominent figures was explored.

Mixed-race children of white mothers were born free, and many families of free people of color were started in those years. 80 percent of the free African-American families in the Upper South in the censuses of 1790 to 1810 can be traced as descendants of unions between white women and African men in colonial Virginia, not of slave women and white men. In the early colony, conditions were loose among the working class, who lived and worked closely together. After the [[American Revolutionary War]], their free mixed-race descendants migrated to the frontiers of nearby states along with other primarily European Virginia pioneers.<ref>Paul Heinegg, [http://www.freeafricanamericans.com ''Free African Americans in Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Maryland and Delaware''], 1999\u20132005.</ref> The admixture also reflects later conditions under slavery, when white planters or their sons, or overseers, frequently raped African women.<ref>Moon, Dannell, \"Slavery\", in ''Encyclopedia of Rape,'' Merril D. Smith (Ed.), Greenwood Publishing Group, 2004, p 234</ref> There were also freely chosen relationships among individuals of different or mixed races.\n\nShriver's 2002 survey found different current admixture rates by region, reflecting historic patterns of settlement and change, both in terms of populations who migrated and their descendants' unions. For example, he found that the black populations with the highest percentage of white ancestry lived in California and Seattle, Washington. These were both majority-white destinations during the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]] of 1940\u20131970 of African Americans from the Deep South of Louisiana, Texas and Mississippi. Blacks sampled in those two locations had more than 25% white European ancestry on average.<ref name=Shriver/>\n\nAs noted by Troy Duster, direct-line testing of the Y-chromosome and mtDNA ([[mitochondrial DNA]]) fails to pick up the heritage of many other ancestors.<ref name=\"hur\" /> DNA testing has limitations and should not be depended on by individuals to answer all questions about heritage.<ref name=\"hur\"/> Duster said that neither Shriver's research nor Gates' PBS program adequately acknowledged the limitations of genetic testing.<ref name=\"hur\"/><ref name=\"bldl1\">{{cite web |url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/10/071018145955.htm|title=Genetic Ancestral Testing Cannot Deliver On Its Promise, Study Warns|author=ScienceDaily|accessdate=2008-10-02 |year=2008 |publisher=ScienceDaily}}</ref>\n\nSimilarly, the Indigenous Peoples Council on Biocolonialism (IPCB) notes that: \"Native American markers\" are not found solely among Native Americans.

For example, in her interview of black/white adults in the South, Nikki Khanna uncovers that one way the one-drop rule is perpetuated is through the mechanism of reflected appraisal. Most respondents identified as black, explaining that this is because both black and white people see them as black as well.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Khanna|first1=Nikki|title=If you're half black, you're just black: Reflected Appraisals and the Persistence of the One-Drop Rule|journal=The Sociological Quarterly|date=2010|volume=51|issue=5|pages=96\u2013121|doi=10.1111/j.1533-8525.2009.01162.x|citeseerx=10.1.1.619.9359}}</ref>\n\n==Allusions==\n[[Charles W. Chesnutt]], who was of mixed race and grew up in the North, wrote stories and novels about the issues of mixed-race people in southern society in the aftermath of the Civil War.\n\nThe one-drop rule and its consequences have been the subject of numerous works of popular culture. The American [[musical theatre|musical]] ''[[Show Boat]]'' (1927) opens in 1887 on a Mississippi River boat, after the Reconstruction era and imposition of [[racial segregation]] and [[Jim Crow]] in the South. Steve, a white man married to a mixed-race woman who [[passing (racial identity)|passes]] as white, is pursued by a Southern sheriff. He intends to arrest Steve and charge him with [[miscegenation]] for being married to a woman of partly black ancestry. Steve pricks his wife's finger and swallows some of her blood. When the sheriff arrives, Steve asks him whether he would consider a man to be white if he had \"negro blood\" in him. The sheriff replies that \"one drop of Negro blood makes you a Negro in these parts\". Steve tells the sheriff that he has \"more than a drop of negro blood in me\". After being assured by others that Steve is telling the truth, the sheriff leaves without arresting Steve.<ref name=tcm>[http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title.jsp?scarlettTitleId=14440 ''Show Boat'' (1951) Overview], Turner Classic Movies.

They are descended from theropod dinosaurs and appeared about 27 million years after the genus ''Archaeopteryx,'' the first discovered transitional dinosaur between dinosaurs and birds. They are commonly placed as a sister group to [[Ornithothoraces]], a group that contains all extant birds along with their closest extinct relatives. Confuciusornithidae consists of four genera, with type-specimens possessing both shafted and non-shafted (downy) feathers. They are also noted for their distinctive pair of ribbon-like tail feathers of disputed function.\n\nThe wing anatomy of confuciusornithids suggests an unusual flight behavior, due to anatomy that implies conflicting abilities. They possess feathers similar to those of fast-flapping birds, which rely on quick flapping of their wings to stay aloft. At the same time, their wing anatomy also suggests a lack of flapping ability. Confusiusornithids are also noted for their beak and lack of teeth, similar to modern birds. Both predators and prey, confuciusornithid fossils have been observed with fish remains in their digestive systems and have themselves been found in the abdominal cavities of ''[[Sinocalliopteryx]], a'' [[Compsognathidae|compsognathid]] predator.\n\n==Classification==\n{{Clade|{{clade\n  |1=''[[Archaeopteryx]]''\n  |2={{clade\n      |1=''[[Jeholornis]]''\n      |2={{clade\n          |1=''[[Sapeornis]]''\n          |label2=&nbsp;[[Pygostylia]]&nbsp;\n          |2={{clade\n             |1=&nbsp;Confuciusornithidae\n             |2=&nbsp;[[Ornithothoraces]]\n            }}\n         }}\n      }}\n   }}|style=font-size:85%;line-height:80%|label1=[[Aves]]&nbsp;}}\n\nConfuciusornithidae was first named by Hou ''et al.'' in 1995 to contain the type genus, ''Confuciusornis'', and assigned to the monotypic clade Confuciusornithiformes within [[Class (biology)|class]] [[Aves]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hou|first=L|last2=Zhou|first2=Z|last3=Gu|first3=Y|last4=Zhang|first4=H|date=1995|title=Description of Confuciusornis sanctus|url=|journal=Chinese Science Bulletin|volume=10|pages=61\u201363|via=}}</ref> The group was given a [[phylogenetic]] definition by Chiappe, in 1999, who defined a node-based [[clade]] Confuciusornithidae to include only ''Changchengornis'' and ''Confuciusornis''.<ref name=\"Chiappe\">Chiappe, Luis M. et. al (1999)</ref>\n\nThere are a number of features that define the clade.

The song both satirizes and celebrates [[nerd]] culture, as recited by the subject who cannot \"roll with the [[gangsta rap|gangstas]]\" because he is \"just too [[White people|white]] and [[nerd]]y\". It includes many references to activities stereotypically associated with nerds and white people, such as collecting [[comic books]] and [[action figures]], playing ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]] (D&D)'', going to [[Renaissance Fair]]s, riding a [[Segway PT|Segway]], [[computer programming|programming computers]], memorizing [[pi]], [[Wikipedia community|editing]] [[Wikipedia]], watching ''[[Happy Days]]'' and ''[[Star Trek]]'', and eating \"[[sandwich]]es with [[mayonnaise]]\".\n\nThe song was Yankovic's first [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] top 10 hit and third top 40 hit, peaking at #9 after debuting at #28.

The video, loosely parodying the video for [[Chamillionaire]]'s \"[[Ridin']]\" and following the song's lyrics, shows Yankovic, dressed as a stereotypical nerd with a buttoned-up polo shirt, dress slacks, and horn-rimmed glasses (see also [[Yuppie]] or [[Preppie]]), attempting to fit in with the \"gangsters\", but instead either scaring them away, causing them to [[The finger|flip him off]] (shown on the scene where Yankovic is riding on a [[Segway PT|Segway]] in the park), or to direct him away from their group and instead towards a herd of other nerds (shown when Yankovic is in a bowling alley). These scenes include shots that directly parody the \"Ridin'\" video, including similar outfits by both artists. Yankovic is seen at night dancing in front of a set of road flares arranged in the form of [[Pac-Man]], similar to the shot of Chamillionaire in front of the figure of a lizard, his personal logo.

It parodies the song <!-- the song is just called \"Ridin'\", not \"Ridin' Dirty\". Yes, I know, that's weird. Please don't change this. -->\"[[Ridin']]\" by [[Chamillionaire]] and [[Krayzie Bone]]. The song both satirizes and celebrates [[nerd]] culture, as recited by the subject who cannot \"roll with the [[gangsta rap|gangstas]]\" because he is \"just too [[White people|white]] and [[nerd]]y\". It includes many references to activities stereotypically associated with nerds and white people, such as collecting [[comic books]] and [[action figures]], playing ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]] (D&D)'', going to [[Renaissance Fair]]s, riding a [[Segway PT|Segway]], [[computer programming|programming computers]], memorizing [[pi]], [[Wikipedia community|editing]] [[Wikipedia]], watching ''[[Happy Days]]'' and ''[[Star Trek]]'', and eating \"[[sandwich]]es with [[mayonnaise]].\"\n\nThe song was Yankovic's first [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] top 10 hit and third top 40 hit, peaking at #9 after debuting at #28. It was certified platinum by the [[RIAA]], the first Yankovic single to achieve this feat.\n\n==Track listing==\n# \"White & Nerdy\"&nbsp;\u2014 2:50\n# \"Don't Download This Song\"&nbsp;\u2014 3:54\n\n==Production and writing==\nWhile Yankovic usually records his songs together with his band, the backing tracks for \"White and Nerdy\" were completely recorded by guitarist [[Jim West (guitarist)|Jim West]]\u2014who handled the synthesizer production\u2014and [[Jon \"Bermuda\" Schwartz]]\u2014who was tasked with recording the drums. The two musicians recorded their specific tracks at their home studios. The finished audio tracks were then brought to Westlake Studio in Los Angeles, California, where Yankovic added his rap vocals.<ref name=whitenerdycard>{{Citation|last=Yankovic|first=Alfred |publisher = [[Volcano Records]] | title = White & Nerdy | work = 'Weird Al' Yankovic Official Limited Edition Trading Cards| number = 77|year=2013}}</ref>\n\n==Music video==\nThe single has an accompanying [[music video]], which was recorded in [[high-definition video|high definition]]. The video, loosely parodying the video for [[Chamillionaire]]'s \"[[Ridin']]\" and following the song's lyrics, shows Yankovic, dressed as a stereotypical nerd with a buttoned-up polo shirt, dress slacks, and horn-rimmed glasses (see also [[Yuppie]] or [[Preppie]]), attempting to fit in with the \"gangsters\", but instead either scaring them away, causing them to [[The finger|flip him off]] (shown on the scene where Yankovic is riding on a [[Segway PT|Segway]] in the park), or to direct him away from their group and instead towards a herd of other nerds (shown when Yankovic is in a bowling alley). These scenes include shots that directly parody the \"Ridin'\" video, including similar outfits by both artists. Yankovic is seen at night dancing in front of a set of road flares arranged in the form of [[Pac-Man]], similar to the shot of Chamillionaire in front of the figure of a lizard, his personal logo. Another repeated scene shows Yankovic along with [[Donny Osmond]]&mdash;the \"whitest guy I could think of\", according to Yankovic<ref>Robert Berry, Robert (September 27, 2006). [http://www.retrocrush.com/archive2006/weirdal/index.html \"The Weird Al Yankovic Interview\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160220045444/http://www.retrocrush.com/archive2006/weirdal/index.html |date=2016-02-20 }}. retrocrush.com.</ref>&mdash;dancing in front of the [[Schr\u00f6dinger equation]], mimicking shots of Chamillionaire and [[Krayzie Bone]] from the \"Ridin'\" video. Yankovic had found Osmond to be eager to be in the video, having memorized the song before recording as well as having his various moves already figured out before filming.<ref name=\"vulture 12videos\"/> Whereas Chamillionaire's video ends with the artist throwing up \"The H\" which is a hand sign representing his hometown of Houston (sometimes mistaken as a gang sign) to the camera, \"White & Nerdy\" ends with Yankovic giving a mistaken version of the [[Vulcan salute]] (his thumb is against the side of his hand instead of perpendicular).\n\n[[File:White Nerdy YOU SUCK cropped.jpg|thumb|Al depicted expressing his opinion about [[Atlantic Records]] on [[Wikipedia]].]]\nFurther interspersed among these shots are additional shots of Yankovic demonstrating his \"white and nerdy\" life. One scene shows Yankovic vandalizing the [[Wikipedia]] page for [[Atlantic Records]], replacing it with the words (in excessively large type and [[Typeface#Proportion|proportional-width]] rather than [[Monospaced font|fixed-width]]) \"YOU SUCK!\", referencing his recent trouble with the company in getting permission to release \"[[You're Pitiful]]\", a parody of [[James Blunt]]'s song \"[[You're Beautiful]]\".<ref name=\"Herald\">{{cite news|last=Adams |first=Cameron |url=http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,21985,20523843-5006024,00.html |title=Weird Al Yankovic |newspaper=[[Herald Sun]] |date=October 5, 2006 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070312053314/http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,21985,20523843-5006024,00.html |archivedate=March 12, 2007 }}</ref> Fans of the video have replicated the action depicted in the video several times.

This is a continuation of his usual trend of putting the number 27 somewhere in his videos. The [[mayonnaise]] Al spreads on a sandwich in the video is labelled \"Pest Foods\" mayonnaise, parodying [[Hellmann's and Best Foods|Best Foods]] mayonnaise. Also, when Yankovic says, \"Even made a homepage for my dog, yo,\" the music video shows a website devoted to his dog, Foofie.\n\nIn addition to Osmond, there are other cameos in the video. [[Jordan Peele]] and [[Keegan-Michael Key]] of ''[[MADtv]]'' appear in the blue 1967 [[Chevrolet Impala]] convertible at the beginning of the video, two \"gangsters\" who are scared away by Yankovic's nerdiness.<ref name=\"vulture 12videos\">{{cite web | url = https://www.vulture.com/2014/07/history-behind-12-great-weird-al-videos.html | title = The History Behind 12 Great Weird Al Videos | first=  Alex | last = Suskind | date = July 15, 2014 | accessdate = July 24, 2019 | work = [[Vulture (magazine)|Vulture]] }}</ref> The license plate on the Impala reads \"OG4LIFE\", a reference to [[Ice-T]]'s 1991 album ''[[O.G.

This medium-sized cat is characterized by solid black spots and streaks on its coat, round ears, and white neck and undersides. It weighs between {{convert|8|and|15.5|kg|lb|abbr=on}} and reaches {{convert|40|\u2013|50|cm|in|abbr=on}} at the shoulders. It was first [[scientific description|described]] by [[Carl Linnaeus]] in 1758. Two [[subspecies]] are recognized: ''L. p. pardalis'' and ''L. p. mitis''.\n\nTypically active during [[twilight]] and at night, the ocelot tends to be solitary and [[Territory (animal)|territorial]]. It is efficient at climbing, leaping and swimming. It preys on small terrestrial mammals, such as [[armadillo]], [[opossum]] and [[lagomorph]]s. Both sexes become [[sexual maturity|sexually mature]] at around two years of age; they can breed throughout the year, though the peak mating season varies geographically. After a [[gestation]] period of two to three months, the female gives birth to a litter of one to three kittens. They stay with their mother for up to two years, after which they leave to establish their own territories.\n\nThe ocelot prefers areas with dense vegetation cover, high prey availability, and proximity to water sources.

Ocelot bones were made into thin, pointed instruments to pierce ears and limbs for [[Bloodletting in Mesoamerica|ritual bloodletting]]. Several figurines depicting ocelots and similar felids are known. In her 1904 work ''A Penitential Rite of the Ancient Mexicans'', archaeologist [[Zelia Nuttall]] described a statue depicting an ocelot or a tiger excavated in Mexico City and its relation to the Aztec deity [[Tezcatlipoca]].

Besides this the personage wears leggings made of the spotted ocelot skin and a rattlesnake girdle from which hang two conventionalized hearts. It is interesting to find that in a note written beneath its photograph the late Senor Islas de Bustamante, independently identified the above figure as a representation of \"Ocelotl-Tezcatlipoca\" or Tlatoca-ocelot, lit. the Lord Ocelot ... and described as wearing \"the beard of the mask of Tezcatlipoca\".}}\n\nLike many other felids, ocelots are occasionally kept as pets. Mindy Stinner (of the [[Conservators Center, Burlington]]) notes that ocelots, unlike [[caracal]]s and [[serval]]s, might demand a lot of attention from their owners. They have a tendency to chew on or suck on objects, such as fabric and the fingers of their owners; this can lead them to accidentally ingest objects like tennis balls. Agile and playful, pet ocelots can be troublesome to keep due to their habit of leaping around and potentially damaging objects; ocelots may unintentionally injure their owners from bites. Nevertheless, carefully raised ocelots can be highly affectionate to their owners.<ref name=\"pewa\">{{cite web |last1=Stinner |first1=M. |title=Care Sheet \u2013 Ocelot |url=http://www.phoenixexotics.org/caresheet/ocelot |publisher=Phoenix Exotic Wildlife Association |accessdate=24 December 2019}}</ref>\nPainter [[Salvador Dal\u00ed]] owned a pet ocelot named Babou that was seen with him at many places he visited, including a voyage aboard [[SS France (1961)|SS ''France'']].

This medium-sized cat is characterized by solid black spots and streaks on its coat, round ears, and white neck and undersides. It weighs between {{convert|8|and|15.5|kg|lb|abbr=on}} and reaches {{convert|40|\u2013|50|cm|in|abbr=on}} at the shoulders. It was first [[scientific description|described]] by [[Carl Linnaeus]] in 1758. Two [[subspecies]] are recognized: ''L. p. pardalis'' and ''L. p. mitis''.\n\nTypically active during [[twilight]] and at night, the ocelot tends to be solitary and [[Territory (animal)|territorial]]. It is efficient at climbing, leaping and swimming. It preys on small terrestrial mammals, such as [[armadillo]], [[opossum]] and [[lagomorph]]s. Both sexes become [[sexual maturity|sexually mature]] at around two years of age; they can breed throughout the year, though the peak mating season varies geographically. After a [[gestation]] period of two to three months, the female gives birth to a litter of one to three kittens. They stay with their mother for up to two years, after which they leave to establish their own territories.\n\nThe ocelot prefers areas with dense vegetation cover, high prey availability, and proximity to water sources. It is listed as [[Least Concern]] on the [[IUCN Red List]], and is threatened by [[habitat destruction]], hunting and [[traffic]] accidents. Populations are decreasing in many parts of its range. The association of the ocelot with humans dates back to the [[Aztec Civilisation|Aztec]] and [[Incan civilization|Incan]] civilizations; it has occasionally been owned as a [[pet]].\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe name \"ocelot\" comes from the [[Nahuatl]] word {{lang|nci|\u014dc\u0113l\u014dtl}} ({{IPA-nah|o\u02d0\u02c8se\u02d0lo\u02d0t\u0361\u026c|pron}}), which generally refers to the [[jaguar]] rather than the ocelot.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |year=2004 |title =ocelot, ''n.'' |encyclopedia=Oxford English Dictionary }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |first=F. |last=Karttunen |year=1983 |authorlink=Frances Karttunen |title=An Analytical Dictionary of Nahuatl |location=Austin, Texas |publisher=University of Texas Press |page=176}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |first=J. |last=Lockhart |authorlink=James Lockhart (historian) |year=2001 |title=Nahuatl as Written: Lessons in Older Written Nahuatl, with Copious Examples and Texts |location=Stanford, California |publisher=Stanford University Press |page=228}}</ref> Another possible origin for the name is the Latin {{lang|la|ocellatus}} (\"having little eyes\" or \"marked with eye-like spots\"), in reference to the cat's spotted coat.<ref name=\"Sunquist\">{{cite book |last1=Sunquist |first1=M. |last2=Sunquist |first2=F. |title=Wild Cats of the World |year=2002 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |location=Chicago, US |isbn=978-0-226-77999-7 |pages=120\u2013129 |chapter=Ocelot ''Leopardus pardalis'' (Linnaeus, 1758) |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=IF8nDwAAQBAJ&lpg=PP1&pg=PA120#v=onepage&f=false}}</ref>\n\nOther vernacular names for the ocelot include {{lang|es-VE|cunagaro}} (Venezuela), {{lang|es-AR|gato onza}} (Argentina), {{lang|es-PA|gato tigre}} (Panama), {{lang|und|heitigrikati}} (Suriname), {{lang|pt-BR|jaguatirica}} (Brazil), {{lang|es-CR|manigordo}} (Costa Rica, Panama and Venezuela), {{lang|pt-BR|maracaja}} (Brazil), {{lang|und|mathuntori}}, {{lang|und|ocelote}}, {{lang|und|onsa}}, {{lang|es-BZ|pumillo}}, {{lang|en-BZ|tiger cat}} (Belize), {{lang|es-BO|tigrecillo}} (Bolivia) and {{lang|es-CO|tigrillo}} (Colombia, Ecuador, Guatemala and Peru).<ref name=mammal /><ref name=\"ojasti\">{{cite book |last1=Ojasti |first1=J. |title=Wildlife Utilization in Latin America: Current Situation and Prospects for Sustainable Management |date=1996 |publisher=[[Food and Agriculture Organization]] |location=Rome |isbn=978-92-5-103316-6 |pages=82\u201384}}</ref>\n\n== Taxonomy ==\n''Felis pardalis'' was the [[scientific name]] proposed for the ocelot by [[Carl Linnaeus]] in 1758.<ref name=\"linnaeus\">{{cite book |last1=Linnaeus |first1=C. |year=1758 |title=Caroli Linn\u00e6i Systema natur\u00e6 per regna tria natur\u00e6, secundum classes, ordines, genera, species, cum characteribus, differentiis, synonymis, locis |location=Holmiae |publisher=Laurentius Salvius |page=42 |chapter=''Felis pardalis'' |volume=Tomus I |edition=10th |chapterurl=https://archive.org/stream/mobot31753000798865#page/41/mode/2up}}</ref> The genus ''[[Leopardus]]'' was proposed by [[John Edward Gray]] in 1842 for several spotted cat skins in the collection of the [[Natural History Museum, London]].<ref name=Gray1842>{{cite journal |last1=Gray |first1= J.

As she told fans during a 1998 online chat with SonicNet, \"There's nothing more pleasing to a songwriter than [someone else] doing one of their songs. ['Landslide'] also led me to being friends with [[Billy Corgan|Billy [Corgan]]] and the possibility that we'll work together,\" she said of the Smashing Pumpkins frontman. \"Over this song, there's been this incredible connection ... he reached out ... I believe that my poetry is really meant for everyone, no matter what age.\" The new version was a hit, making it to the top three on the [[Modern Rock Tracks]] chart in the United States that year and number 30 on the US Airplay charts. The song was also featured on the US version of their greatest hits album ''[[Rotten Apples]]''.

The group's arrangement went on to be one of the rock band's most-beloved tracks and even had the approval of Nicks herself. As she told fans during a 1998 online chat with SonicNet, \"There's nothing more pleasing to a songwriter than [someone else] doing one of their songs. ['Landslide'] also led me to being friends with [[Billy Corgan|Billy [Corgan]]] and the possibility that we'll work together,\" she said of the Smashing Pumpkins frontman. \"Over this song, there's been this incredible connection ... he reached out ... I believe that my poetry is really meant for everyone, no matter what age.\" The new version was a hit, making it to the top three on the [[Modern Rock Tracks]] chart in the United States that year and number 30 on the US Airplay charts. The song was also featured on the US version of their greatest hits album ''[[Rotten Apples]]''. It was later used in the TV show ''[[Alias (TV series)|Alias]]'' on season 1 in the episode ''Page 47''.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! Chart (1994)\n!

Lead singer [[Natalie Maines]] said she was attracted, in part, to the song because she was then the same age that Nicks was when she initially performed it. The Dixie Chicks performed the song with Nicks at ''[[VH1 Divas Las Vegas]]'' in 2002.\n\nThis rendition, featuring the group's two- and three-part harmonies, reached the top 10 on both the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and the ''Billboard'' [[Hot Country Songs]] chart, and it became the Dixie Chicks' only number-one single to date on the ''Billboard'' [[Adult Contemporary (chart)|Adult Contemporary]] chart. Outside the United States, the song reached number two in Canada and number six in Australia, becoming the group's sole top-ten hit in the latter country. Their version has been certified Platinum by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] and 3\u00d7 Platinum by the [[Australian Recording Industry Association]], surpassing the commercial success of the original.\n\nThe music video for the song was directed by Jim Gable and edited by Scott C.
