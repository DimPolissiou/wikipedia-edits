Other characters included manager Reginald Tarkington ([[Harvey Korman]]), and head of housekeeping Ms. Frick (also portrayed by Leachman). Frick, a more pleasant version of Leachman's Frau Blucher character from Brooks' ''[[Young Frankenstein]]'', appeared in every episode, Mrs. Nutt only in the pilot.\n\n''The Nutt House'' was a very broad [[satire]] in which the main story was periodically interrupted by short, unrelated, and often surreal background gags,{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} not unlike those of ''[[Police Squad!]]''. Its audience was quite a narrow one, as the single-camera show was intensely visual, and it was cancelled within 6 weeks of its premiere. However, all 11 of the produced episodes were broadcast on BBC 2 in the United Kingdom, where ''Police Squad!'' was making a comeback due to the success of ''[[The Naked Gun]]''. It became a moderate success being shown on Saturday evening following [[Clive James]]' ''[[Saturday Night Clive]]''. Brooks appeared on this programme to promote the first episode of ''The Nutt House'' on 14 October 1989. However, to the dismay of viewers, the BBC did not give the show a fixed airtime. Usually shown around 23.00 hours (but sometimes as late as 23.30), the final episode inexplicably aired at 19.30 on 16 December 1989.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Cloris Leachman]] as Ms. Frick (also Edwina Nutt in the pilot episode)\n* [[Harvey Korman]] as Reginald Tarkington\n* [[Brian McNamara]] as Charles Nutt III\n* [[Molly Hagan]] as Sally Lonnaneck\n* [[Gregory Itzin]] as Dennis\n* [[Mark Blankfield]] as Freddy\n\n==Episodes==\n<onlyinclude>\n{| class=wikitable style=\"background:#FFFFFF\"\n|- style=\"color:#FFFFFF\"\n! style=\"background:#ab1616; width:20px\"| N\u00ba\n! style=\"background:#ab1616\"| Title\n! style=\"background:#ab1616; width:120px\"| Directed by:\n! style=\"background:#ab1616; width:130px\"| Written by:\n! style=\"background:#ab1616; width:135px\"| Original air date\n! style=\"background:#ab1616; width:80px\"| Viewers (in millions)\n{{Episode list/sublist|The Nutt House\n |EpisodeNumber = 1\n |Title = Pilot\n |DirectedBy = [[Gary Nelson (director)|Gary Nelson]]\n |WrittenBy = [[Mel Brooks]] & [[Alan Spencer]]\n |Viewers = 23.0 {{fact|date=April 2020}}\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|1989|9|20}}\n |ShortSummary = When Big Jake Herder ([[David Huddleston]]) of the powerful Texplex hotel chain announces his intention to purchase the failing Nutt House hotel, proprietress Edwina Nutt calls on her ne'er-do-well grandson, Charles Nutt III, to intervene.

The Irish elk was a prime example because it had evolved from a smaller ancestor with smaller antlers. In terms of the Irish elk, orthogenesis was claimed to have caused an evolutionary trajectory towards antlers that became larger and larger, eventually causing the species' extinction because the antlers grew to sizes which inhibited proper feeding habits and caused the animal to become trapped in tree branches.<ref name=Hughes />\n\nIn the 1930s, orthogenesis was disputed by Darwinians led by [[Julian Huxley]], who noted that antler size was relative to body size. Because the Irish elk was a large organism compared to its smaller relatives such as deer, there was an [[Allometry|allometric]] relationship between the antlers and body size.<ref>Anderson, Kristina. \"What On Earth - A Canadian Newsletter for the Earth Sciences.\" What On Earth - A Canadian Newsletter for the Earth Sciences.

This reduction in antler mass is 2.7 times more extreme than expected given the allometric relationship between antler and body masses in red deer<ref name=\"gould1974\"/> and demonstrates a rapid evolution of smaller antlers. A similar change in a typical Irish elk population with prime stags having {{cvt|35|kg}} antlers<ref name=\"barnosky86\"/> would result in antler weights of {{cvt|13|kg}} or less in worsening climatic conditions.

The antlers of the Irish elk should have been able to evolve rapidly in the face of selection for smaller and less expensive sizes. This conclusion is supported by the great diversity of Irish elk antler forms found among different populations at different times, including compact upright orientations possibly from populations inhabiting more heavily wooded environments<ref>Lister 1994</ref> suggesting the evolutionary malleability of Irish elk antlers.\"<ref name=\"Worman\"/> Ultimately, the decrease in energy intake by the Late Pleistocene, influenced the ability to produce for Irish elk females.<ref name=\"Worman\">{{cite journal |last2= Kimbrell|first2= Tristan|title= Getting to the hart of the matter: Did antlers truly cause the extinction of the Irish elk?|url= https://semanticscholar.org/paper/ff4d412edd3dcb9f15a1321f780f507468024bf3|journal= Oikos|volume= 117|issue= 9|pages= 1397\u20131405|doi=10.1111/j.0030-1299.2008.16608.x|year= 2008|last1= O'Driscoll Worman|first1= Cedric}}</ref>\n\n===Reproduction===\n[[File:Knight Megaloceros.jpg|thumb|left|Restoration by [[Charles R. Knight]]]]\nFrequent debates occur as to whether or not sexual selection led to the Irish elk's extinction. Sexual selection can increase or decrease a population's chance of extinction, due to behaviours such as male-male competition and female choice. Also, sexual harassment by males can result in lower female fecundity or even death.<ref name=\"Kokko\">Kokko, H., & Brooks, R. (2003). Sexy to die for? sexual selection and the risk of extinction. Annales Zoologici Fennici, 40(2), 207-219. Retrieved from http://search.proquest.com/docview/18804232</ref> Regardless of the details of the species' life history, extinction would require that too few males survive to maturity to fertilize a sufficient number of females to maintain a viable population.<ref name=\"Kokko\"/> When it comes to male-male competition, if the assumption is that detrimental effects are clear in only the males, a surviving male would have a large number of females to choose from, with little competition. Selection must, therefore, favour the less extreme male genotypes, and generating a scenario seems impossible where males with larger antlers are still selected for when the lifetime reproductive success of males with large antlers approaches zero (as required for deterministic extinction to occur).<ref name=\"Kokko\"/>\n\nIn female choice, sexual selection could, thus, reinforce natural selection and lead to quicker responses to environmental changes, should they occur.<ref name=\"Kokko\"/> With a decrease in male population, females have fewer choices, which could result in inbreeding. This can pose significant threats to population survival.<ref name=\"Kokko\"/> However, many of these studies are contradicting. Females may adaptively avoid the accumulation of inbreeding, so that female choice might increase effective population size.<ref name=\"Kokko\"/>\n\nLate Pleistocene fossils from Ballybetagh bog, near Dublin, Ireland, indicate that males segregated from females during winters.<ref name=\"barnosky85\"/> This type of segregation implies that the Irish elk had behaviours such as [[Rut (mammalian reproduction)|rutting]] and polygynous mating systems, where a single male mates with two or more females. This also supports the belief that the large antler size was used for social display. Within male groups, winterkill was the chief cause of death and was highest among juveniles and small adults with small antlers.<ref name=\"barnosky85\"/>\n\n===Habitat===\nNeither exclusive to Ireland nor an elk, it was named so because the most well-known and best-preserved fossil specimens have been found in lake sediments and [[peat bog]]s in Ireland. The Irish elk had a far-reaching range, being located throughout Europe, northern Africa, and some related forms located in China.\n\nThe Irish elk prioritized open grassland habitats and was in fact the most [[cursorial]] cervid known.<ref>Geist, V. 1999. Deer of the World. Swan Hill Press, Shrewsbury.</ref> Other ungulates that prefer open habitats, including the related [[fallow deer]], typically have more ostentatious colour patterns.\n\n==Extinction==\n[[File:Crystal Palace Megaloceros.jpg|thumb|Sculptures in [[Crystal Palace Park|Crystal Palace]]]]\nA number of hypotheses are easy to advance regarding the disappearance of the more localized populations of this species. The situation is less clear regarding the final demise of the Irish elk in continental Eurasia east of the Urals. Stuart ''et al.'' (2004) tentatively suggest that a combination of human presence along rivers and slow decrease in habitat quality in upland areas presented the last Irish elk with the choice of either good habitat with considerable hunting pressure, or general absence of humans in a suboptimal habitat.\n\nTraditionally, discussion of the cause of their extinction has focused on the antler size (rather than on their overall body size), which may be due more to their impact on the observer than any actual property. Some have suggested hunting by humans was a contributing factor in the demise of the Irish elk, as may have been the case with other prehistoric [[megafauna]], even assuming that the large antler size restricted the movement of males through forested regions or that it was by some other means a \"[[maladaptation]]\".<ref name=\"gould1974\"/> Others assume the ultimate cause of extinction may have been the adaptations for mineral metabolism that were beneficial to the Irish elk until vegetation changed.<ref name=\"moen99\">{{cite journal|last=Moen|first=Ron A.|first2=John|last2=Pastor |first3=Yosef|last3=Cohen |title=Antler growth and extinction of Irish elk|journal=Evolutionary Ecology Research|year=1999|pages=235\u2013249|url=http://www.duluth.umn.edu/~rmoen/Dld/Moen_1999.pdf}}</ref> But given the difficulty of recovering quantitative records of human hunting impacts from the sub-fossil record alone, the role of humans in the extinction of the Irish elk is not yet clear.\n\nSome research has suggested that a lack of sufficient high-quality [[forage]] caused the extinction of the elk. According to an article written by researchers Silvia Gonzalez, Andrew Kitcheneri, and Adrian Lister, in 2000, a reduction in forest density into the Late Pleistocene decreased nutritional selection and is believed to have led to a conflict between sexual selection and ultimately a decrease in antler and body size, which can explain what may have caused their demise.<ref name=\"Gonzalez\">{{cite journal|last=Gonzalez|first=Silvia|author2=Andrew Kitchener |author3=Adrian Lister |title=Survival of the Irish elk into the Holocene|journal=Nature|date=15 June 2000|volume=405|issue=6788|pages=753\u2013754|doi=10.1038/35015668|pmid=10866185}}</ref> High amounts of [[calcium]] and [[phosphate]] compounds are required to form antlers, and therefore large quantities of these minerals are required for the massive structures of the Irish elk. The males (and male deer in general) met this requirement partly from their bones, replenishing them from food plants after the antlers were grown or reclaiming the nutrients from discarded antlers (as has been observed in extant deer). Thus, in the antler growth phase, giant deer suffered from a condition similar to [[osteoporosis]].<ref name=\"moen99\" /> When the climate changed at the end of the [[last glacial period]], the vegetation in the animal's habitat also changed towards species that presumably could not deliver sufficient amounts of the required minerals, at least in the western part of its range.\n\nSimply blaming antler size for their extinction may not be entirely accurate. The most likely cause is the significantly shortened growing season seen toward the end of the Pleistocene Era. This reduced availability in nutrition resulted in the lowering of the female reproduction output by about 50%.<ref name=\"Worman\"/>\n\nHowever, the most recent specimen of ''M. giganteus'' in northern Siberia, dated to approximately 7,700 years ago &mdash; well after the end of the last glacial period &mdash; shows no sign of nutrient stress. This specimen came from a region with a [[continental climate]] where the proposed vegetation changes had not yet occurred.<ref>{{aut|Hughes, Sandrine; Hayden, Thomas J.; Douady, Christophe J.; Tougard, Christelle; Germonpr\u00e9, Mietje; Stuart, Anthony; Lbova, Lyudmila; Carden, Ruth F.; H\u00e4nni, Catherine; Say, Ludovic}} (2006).

Giant deer fossils found on the [[Isle of Man]] at Ballaugh confirm the survival of the species into early Holocene in at least this area. The [[Ballaugh Elk]] skeleton is smaller than the entire range of Irish skeletons, but has a relatively large skull and the antlers are well-sized for an adult male. This suggests that size decreased into the Holocene.\n\nThere is strong intraspecific [[allometry]] among Irish deer. Smaller animals have relatively shorter antlers. Reduced display organs are theorized to indicate a prelude to extinction from nutritional stress. Reduced forage density leads to a conflict between sexual selection for antler size and nutritional selection pressures. These factors reduced populations and the body size of the giant deer. However, data indicates that they are unlikely to have been wholly responsible for the animal's extinction. With available evidence, it is hard to define the cause of extinction.\n\nMany scientists argue that factors like ecological change, virulent disease, and hunting by people wiped out many large mammal species during the end of the European Ice age, including the giant deer. Fossils found on the Isle of Man at Ballaugh, and at two places in western Siberia postdating the supposed extinction of the species show that, whatever the causes, the actual termination of the species was likely due to a variety of factors which had different significance and timing in different parts of the species' range.<ref name=\"Gonzalez\"/><ref>Irish Elk Survived after Ice Age Ended Author(s): S.

The Irish elk was a prime example because it had evolved from a smaller ancestor with smaller antlers. In terms of the Irish elk, orthogenesis was claimed to have caused an evolutionary trajectory towards antlers that became larger and larger, eventually causing the species' extinction because the antlers grew to sizes which inhibited proper feeding habits and caused the animal to become trapped in tree branches.<ref name=Hughes />\n\nIn the 1930s, orthogenesis was disputed by Darwinians led by [[Julian Huxley]], who noted that antler size was relative to body size. Because the Irish elk was a large organism compared to its smaller relatives such as deer, there was an [[Allometry|allometric]] relationship between the antlers and body size.<ref>Anderson, Kristina. \"What On Earth - A Canadian Newsletter for the Earth Sciences.\" What On Earth - A Canadian Newsletter for the Earth Sciences.

Because basal circumference is highly correlated with other linear measures of antler size,<ref>Barto\u0161 and Bahbouh 2006</ref> such a decrease indicates that insular antler mass dropped to {{frac|1|14}} of the mainland antler mass. This reduction in antler mass is 2.7 times more extreme than expected given the allometric relationship between antler and body masses in red deer<ref name=\"gould1974\"/> and demonstrates a rapid evolution of smaller antlers. A similar change in a typical Irish elk population with prime stags having {{cvt|35|kg}} antlers<ref name=\"barnosky86\"/> would result in antler weights of {{cvt|13|kg}} or less in worsening climatic conditions. This estimate is within the range of extant wapiti/red deer (''Cervus'' spp.) antler weights.<ref name=\"geist\"/>\n\nIrish elk stags in more adverse environments had smaller bodies and relatively even smaller antlers,<ref name=\"moen99\"/><ref name=\"barnosky85\"/> but proponents of the antler-extinction hypothesis have not addressed the possibility of rapid evolutionary reduction in antler size. The antlers of the Irish elk should have been able to evolve rapidly in the face of selection for smaller and less expensive sizes. This conclusion is supported by the great diversity of Irish elk antler forms found among different populations at different times, including compact upright orientations possibly from populations inhabiting more heavily wooded environments<ref>Lister 1994</ref> suggesting the evolutionary malleability of Irish elk antlers.\"<ref name=\"Worman\"/> Ultimately, the decrease in energy intake by the Late Pleistocene, influenced the ability to produce for Irish elk females.<ref name=\"Worman\">{{cite journal |last2= Kimbrell|first2= Tristan|title= Getting to the hart of the matter: Did antlers truly cause the extinction of the Irish elk?|url= https://semanticscholar.org/paper/ff4d412edd3dcb9f15a1321f780f507468024bf3|journal= Oikos|volume= 117|issue= 9|pages= 1397\u20131405|doi=10.1111/j.0030-1299.2008.16608.x|year= 2008|last1= O'Driscoll Worman|first1= Cedric}}</ref>\n\n===Reproduction===\n[[File:Knight Megaloceros.jpg|thumb|left|Restoration by [[Charles R. Knight]]]]\nFrequent debates occur as to whether or not sexual selection led to the Irish elk's extinction. Sexual selection can increase or decrease a population's chance of extinction, due to behaviours such as male-male competition and female choice. Also, sexual harassment by males can result in lower female fecundity or even death.<ref name=\"Kokko\">Kokko, H., & Brooks, R. (2003). Sexy to die for? sexual selection and the risk of extinction. Annales Zoologici Fennici, 40(2), 207-219. Retrieved from http://search.proquest.com/docview/18804232</ref> Regardless of the details of the species' life history, extinction would require that too few males survive to maturity to fertilize a sufficient number of females to maintain a viable population.<ref name=\"Kokko\"/> When it comes to male-male competition, if the assumption is that detrimental effects are clear in only the males, a surviving male would have a large number of females to choose from, with little competition. Selection must, therefore, favour the less extreme male genotypes, and generating a scenario seems impossible where males with larger antlers are still selected for when the lifetime reproductive success of males with large antlers approaches zero (as required for deterministic extinction to occur).<ref name=\"Kokko\"/>\n\nIn female choice, sexual selection could, thus, reinforce natural selection and lead to quicker responses to environmental changes, should they occur.<ref name=\"Kokko\"/> With a decrease in male population, females have fewer choices, which could result in inbreeding. This can pose significant threats to population survival.<ref name=\"Kokko\"/> However, many of these studies are contradicting. Females may adaptively avoid the accumulation of inbreeding, so that female choice might increase effective population size.<ref name=\"Kokko\"/>\n\nLate Pleistocene fossils from Ballybetagh bog, near Dublin, Ireland, indicate that males segregated from females during winters.<ref name=\"barnosky85\"/> This type of segregation implies that the Irish elk had behaviours such as [[Rut (mammalian reproduction)|rutting]] and polygynous mating systems, where a single male mates with two or more females. This also supports the belief that the large antler size was used for social display. Within male groups, winterkill was the chief cause of death and was highest among juveniles and small adults with small antlers.<ref name=\"barnosky85\"/>\n\n===Habitat===\nNeither exclusive to Ireland nor an elk, it was named so because the most well-known and best-preserved fossil specimens have been found in lake sediments and [[peat bog]]s in Ireland. The Irish elk had a far-reaching range, being located throughout Europe, northern Africa, and some related forms located in China.\n\nThe Irish elk prioritized open grassland habitats and was in fact the most [[cursorial]] cervid known.<ref>Geist, V. 1999. Deer of the World. Swan Hill Press, Shrewsbury.</ref> Other ungulates that prefer open habitats, including the related [[fallow deer]], typically have more ostentatious colour patterns.\n\n==Extinction==\n[[File:Crystal Palace Megaloceros.jpg|thumb|Sculptures in [[Crystal Palace Park|Crystal Palace]]]]\nA number of hypotheses are easy to advance regarding the disappearance of the more localized populations of this species. The situation is less clear regarding the final demise of the Irish elk in continental Eurasia east of the Urals. Stuart ''et al.'' (2004) tentatively suggest that a combination of human presence along rivers and slow decrease in habitat quality in upland areas presented the last Irish elk with the choice of either good habitat with considerable hunting pressure, or general absence of humans in a suboptimal habitat.\n\nTraditionally, discussion of the cause of their extinction has focused on the antler size (rather than on their overall body size), which may be due more to their impact on the observer than any actual property. Some have suggested hunting by humans was a contributing factor in the demise of the Irish elk, as may have been the case with other prehistoric [[megafauna]], even assuming that the large antler size restricted the movement of males through forested regions or that it was by some other means a \"[[maladaptation]]\".<ref name=\"gould1974\"/> Others assume the ultimate cause of extinction may have been the adaptations for mineral metabolism that were beneficial to the Irish elk until vegetation changed.<ref name=\"moen99\">{{cite journal|last=Moen|first=Ron A.|first2=John|last2=Pastor |first3=Yosef|last3=Cohen |title=Antler growth and extinction of Irish elk|journal=Evolutionary Ecology Research|year=1999|pages=235\u2013249|url=http://www.duluth.umn.edu/~rmoen/Dld/Moen_1999.pdf}}</ref> But given the difficulty of recovering quantitative records of human hunting impacts from the sub-fossil record alone, the role of humans in the extinction of the Irish elk is not yet clear.\n\nSome research has suggested that a lack of sufficient high-quality [[forage]] caused the extinction of the elk. According to an article written by researchers Silvia Gonzalez, Andrew Kitcheneri, and Adrian Lister, in 2000, a reduction in forest density into the Late Pleistocene decreased nutritional selection and is believed to have led to a conflict between sexual selection and ultimately a decrease in antler and body size, which can explain what may have caused their demise.<ref name=\"Gonzalez\">{{cite journal|last=Gonzalez|first=Silvia|author2=Andrew Kitchener |author3=Adrian Lister |title=Survival of the Irish elk into the Holocene|journal=Nature|date=15 June 2000|volume=405|issue=6788|pages=753\u2013754|doi=10.1038/35015668|pmid=10866185}}</ref> High amounts of [[calcium]] and [[phosphate]] compounds are required to form antlers, and therefore large quantities of these minerals are required for the massive structures of the Irish elk. The males (and male deer in general) met this requirement partly from their bones, replenishing them from food plants after the antlers were grown or reclaiming the nutrients from discarded antlers (as has been observed in extant deer). Thus, in the antler growth phase, giant deer suffered from a condition similar to [[osteoporosis]].<ref name=\"moen99\" /> When the climate changed at the end of the [[last glacial period]], the vegetation in the animal's habitat also changed towards species that presumably could not deliver sufficient amounts of the required minerals, at least in the western part of its range.\n\nSimply blaming antler size for their extinction may not be entirely accurate. The most likely cause is the significantly shortened growing season seen toward the end of the Pleistocene Era. This reduced availability in nutrition resulted in the lowering of the female reproduction output by about 50%.<ref name=\"Worman\"/>\n\nHowever, the most recent specimen of ''M. giganteus'' in northern Siberia, dated to approximately 7,700 years ago &mdash; well after the end of the last glacial period &mdash; shows no sign of nutrient stress. This specimen came from a region with a [[continental climate]] where the proposed vegetation changes had not yet occurred.<ref>{{aut|Hughes, Sandrine; Hayden, Thomas J.; Douady, Christophe J.; Tougard, Christelle; Germonpr\u00e9, Mietje; Stuart, Anthony; Lbova, Lyudmila; Carden, Ruth F.; H\u00e4nni, Catherine; Say, Ludovic}} (2006).

Giant deer fossils found on the [[Isle of Man]] at Ballaugh confirm the survival of the species into early Holocene in at least this area. The [[Ballaugh Elk]] skeleton is smaller than the entire range of Irish skeletons, but has a relatively large skull and the antlers are well-sized for an adult male. This suggests that size decreased into the Holocene.\n\nThere is strong intraspecific [[allometry]] among Irish deer. Smaller animals have relatively shorter antlers. Reduced display organs are theorized to indicate a prelude to extinction from nutritional stress. Reduced forage density leads to a conflict between sexual selection for antler size and nutritional selection pressures. These factors reduced populations and the body size of the giant deer. However, data indicates that they are unlikely to have been wholly responsible for the animal's extinction. With available evidence, it is hard to define the cause of extinction.\n\nMany scientists argue that factors like ecological change, virulent disease, and hunting by people wiped out many large mammal species during the end of the European Ice age, including the giant deer. Fossils found on the Isle of Man at Ballaugh, and at two places in western Siberia postdating the supposed extinction of the species show that, whatever the causes, the actual termination of the species was likely due to a variety of factors which had different significance and timing in different parts of the species' range.<ref name=\"Gonzalez\"/><ref>Irish Elk Survived after Ice Age Ended Author(s): S.
