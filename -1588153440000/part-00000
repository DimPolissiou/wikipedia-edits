Anderson and [[Alton Meister]], were the first to report on the ability of GGC to augment cellular GSH levels in a rat model [3]. Intact GGC, which was synthesised in their own laboratory, was shown to be taken up by cells, bypassing the rate-limiting step of the GCL enzyme to be converted to glutathione. Control experiments with combinations of the constituent amino acids that make up GGC, including  L-glutamic acid and L-cysteine, were ineffective.

Carter was greatly influenced by [[mythologist]] [[Joseph Campbell]], who visited his college, and American mystic [[Carlos Castaneda]]. He was also influenced by the American landscape, [[Arthurian mythology]], the environment, and transcendental psychology.\n\n== Partnership with Tracy Grammer ==\n[[Image:CarterGrammer.jpg|thumb|left|Dave Carter and Tracy Grammer]]\n{{main|Dave Carter and Tracy Grammer}}\n\nPrior to her death, Carter released three albums with Grammer: ''[[When I Go (album)|When I Go]]'' (1998); ''[[Tanglewood Tree]]'' (2000); and ''[[Drum Hat Buddha]]'' (2001).  The duo re-recorded many of the songs from ''[[Snake Handlin' Man]]'', plus two previously unrecorded songs, in early 2002.  The CD, called ''[[Seven Is the Number]]'', was released by Tracy Grammer in 2006. A collection of the duo's holiday recordings called ''[[American Noel]]'' was compiled by Tracy Grammer and released in 2008 by Signature Sounds.\n\n== Transgender identity ==\nIn 2000 Carter revealed to Grammer that she had struggled with [[gender dysphoria]] since her early teen years.<ref>https://www.npr.org/2012/07/19/157047115/tracy-grammer-on-world-cafe</ref><ref name=\"santafenewmexican.com\">http://www.santafenewmexican.com/pasatiempo/music/in_concert/article_0ff77864-a2e5-11e2-bd08-0019bb30f31a.html</ref> Grammer later said, \"...[s]he was exploring a gender change and that altered the dynamics of our off-stage relationship. It actually made things quite difficult for us personally, but anyone on the outside would not have known that. It was just a process that we were going through and that, thankfully, we reconciled with by the time [s]he died.\"<ref>http://staugustine.com/stories/091208/compass_021.shtml</ref>\n\nOf this timeframe, Grammer said: \"...We even had a whole plan for the unveiling.

She was 49.  Carter's death came as a great shock to the folk music community.  Tracy Grammer gave her account of Carter's final moments in a letter to fans: <blockquote>\"Yesterday, shortly after he went unconscious, he came back for a lucid minute or two to tell me, 'I just died... Baby, I just died...' There was a look of wonder in his eyes, and though I cried and tried to deny it to him, I knew he was right and he was on his way. He stayed with me a minute more but despite my attempts to keep him with me, I could see he was already riding that thin chiffon wave between here and gone. He loved beauty, he was hopelessly drawn to the magic and the light in all things. I figure he saw something he could not resist out of the corner of his eye and flew into it. Despite the fact that every rescue attempt was made by paramedics and hospital staff and the death pronouncement officially came at 12:08 pm Eastern Time, I believe he died in my arms in our favorite hotel, leaving me with those final words. That's the true story I am going to tell.\"<ref name=\"Grammer2002\">Grammer, Tracy, [http://daveandtracy.globalhosting.com/index.php?startrow=30 \"Love From Tracy\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928082153/http://daveandtracy.globalhosting.com/index.php?startrow=30 |date=2007-09-28 }}, post at daveandtracy.com, Sunday, July 21, 2002</ref></blockquote>\n\nMany had predicted that the duo was destined for success beyond the typical folk music circles.  Jim Olsen, president of Carter's record label, [[Signature Sounds]], said, ''\"I always believed it would only take one cover by a major star to unveil his work to the rest of the world; and I was convinced that was going to happen.

Spotlight: Dave Carter and Tracy Grammer,\" ''[[Sing Out!]]'' Vol 45 # 1, Spring 2001</ref>  She went on to study what she called \"the psychology of mystical experience\" at the [[Institute of Transpersonal Psychology]] in [[Palo Alto, California|Palo Alto]]  and the [[California Institute of Integral Studies]] in [[San Francisco]],<ref name = \"mmatters\" /> and worked as an [[embedded systems]] programmer for several years before taking up music full-time in the mid-1990s. Carter was greatly influenced by [[mythologist]] [[Joseph Campbell]], who visited her college, and American mystic [[Carlos Castaneda]]. She was also influenced by the American landscape, [[Arthurian mythology]], the environment, and transcendental psychology.\n\n== Partnership with Tracy Grammer ==\n[[Image:CarterGrammer.jpg|thumb|left|Dave Carter and Tracy Grammer]]\n{{main|Dave Carter and Tracy Grammer}}\n\nPrior to her death, Carter released three albums with Grammer: ''[[When I Go (album)|When I Go]]'' (1998); ''[[Tanglewood Tree]]'' (2000); and ''[[Drum Hat Buddha]]'' (2001).  The duo re-recorded many of the songs from ''[[Snake Handlin' Man]]'', plus two previously unrecorded songs, in early 2002.  The CD, called ''[[Seven Is the Number]]'', was released by Tracy Grammer in 2006. A collection of the duo's holiday recordings called ''[[American Noel]]'' was compiled by Tracy Grammer and released in 2008 by Signature Sounds.\n\n== Transgender identity ==\nIn 2000 Carter revealed to Grammer that she had struggled with [[gender dysphoria]] since her early teen years.<ref>https://www.npr.org/2012/07/19/157047115/tracy-grammer-on-world-cafe</ref><ref name=\"santafenewmexican.com\">http://www.santafenewmexican.com/pasatiempo/music/in_concert/article_0ff77864-a2e5-11e2-bd08-0019bb30f31a.html</ref> Grammer later said, \"...[s]he was exploring a gender change and that altered the dynamics of our off-stage relationship. It actually made things quite difficult for us personally, but anyone on the outside would not have known that. It was just a process that we were going through and that, thankfully, we reconciled with by the time [s]he died.\"<ref>http://staugustine.com/stories/091208/compass_021.shtml</ref>\n\nOf this timeframe, Grammer said: \"...We even had a whole plan for the unveiling. [S]he was going to release one more ... 'Cowboy Dave' album, and I would introduce myself as a solo artist. Then [s]he would go change and we would come back as an all-girl band, calling ourselves 'The Butterfly Conservatory.' he would be she and that would be that.\"<ref name=\"santafenewmexican.com\"/>\n\n== Death and tributes ==\n\nCarter died of a massive heart attack Friday July 19, 2002 in a hotel room in [[Hadley, Massachusetts]]<ref name = NYTobit>''[[The New York Times]]'', (obituary), July 25, 2002</ref> after returning from an early morning run.<ref name = '\"Marcel\"'>Marcel, Joyce, \"BABY, I JUST DIED: THE PASSING OF ALAN LOMAX,\" (obituary for Carter and [[Alan Lomax]] who died the same day) [http://www.american-reporter.com/ ''The American Reporter''] Dummerston, Vermont</ref>  She and Grammer were slated to play that weekend at the Green River Festival in [[Greenfield, Massachusetts|Greenfield]]<ref name = \"lana\">McDonald, Fern, [http://www.misslana.com/greenriverfest.htm \"Green River Festival\"], at misslana.com July 20, 2002</ref>  and were booked that summer to play many of the nation's top [[folk festival]]s and [[folk clubs]].  She was 49.  Carter's death came as a great shock to the folk music community.  Tracy Grammer gave her account of Carter's final moments in a letter to fans: <blockquote>\"Yesterday, shortly after he went unconscious, he came back for a lucid minute or two to tell me, 'I just died... Baby, I just died...' There was a look of wonder in his eyes, and though I cried and tried to deny it to him, I knew he was right and he was on his way. He stayed with me a minute more but despite my attempts to keep him with me, I could see he was already riding that thin chiffon wave between here and gone. He loved beauty, he was hopelessly drawn to the magic and the light in all things. I figure he saw something he could not resist out of the corner of his eye and flew into it. Despite the fact that every rescue attempt was made by paramedics and hospital staff and the death pronouncement officially came at 12:08 pm Eastern Time, I believe he died in my arms in our favorite hotel, leaving me with those final words. That's the true story I am going to tell.\"<ref name=\"Grammer2002\">Grammer, Tracy, [http://daveandtracy.globalhosting.com/index.php?startrow=30 \"Love From Tracy\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928082153/http://daveandtracy.globalhosting.com/index.php?startrow=30 |date=2007-09-28 }}, post at daveandtracy.com, Sunday, July 21, 2002</ref></blockquote>\n\nMany had predicted that the duo was destined for success beyond the typical folk music circles.  Jim Olsen, president of Carter's record label, [[Signature Sounds]], said, ''\"I always believed it would only take one cover by a major star to unveil his work to the rest of the world; and I was convinced that was going to happen. Somebody was going to open the door for them; and the thing about Dave's music is that once people heard it, they became lifelong fans.\"''<ref name = \"Alarik2002\">Alarik, Scott, \"Dave Carter, 49, folk artist touted as 'major lyrical talent',\" ''[[Boston Globe]], page B7, July 23, 2002</ref>  Fellow folksinger and journalist [[Matt Watroba]] wrote, ''\"It would make sense at this point, to say that Dave Carter was on the verge of something big.

Highlights included [[Chris Smither|Chris Smither's]] cover of \"Crocodile Man\", [[Mark Erelli]] singing \"Cowboy Singer\", a rendition of \"Happytown\" by [[The Kennedys (band)|The Kennedys]], and \"Farewell to Saint Dolores\" by [[Eddie From Ohio]].  Grammer herself opened the show with \"The Mountain\" and closed with \"Gentle Soldier of My Soul\". Several artists have since written tributes in Carter's honor ([[Dave Carter#Tributes|see below]]) and in 2005 Grammer released ''[[Flower of Avalon]]'', including nine previously unrecorded songs by Carter.\n\n== Songwriting ==\n\nDave Carter's songs have been covered by many others, most notably by [[Judy Collins]] and [[Willie Nelson]] (\"When I Go\"), [[Joan Baez]] (\"The Mountain\"), [[Lucy Kaplansky]] (\"Cowboy Singer\") and Chris Smither (\"Crocodile Man\"). Tributes to Dave following her death were written by Tracy Grammer (\"The Verdant Mile\")  and [[Richard Shindell]] (\"So Says the Whippoorwill\"), among others.\n\nOne song, \"Gentle Arms of Eden\", was added to the hymnal in at least one [[Unitarian Universalist]] congregation.
