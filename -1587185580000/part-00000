The origins of Enosis date back to 1821, the year when the [[Greek War of Independence]] commenced, and the archbishop of Cyprus, his archdeacon, and three bishops were beheaded, amongst other atrocities. In 1828, Count [[Ioannis Kapodistrias]], the first governor of Greece, asked for the union of Cyprus with Greece, while small-scale uprisings also occurred.{{sfn|Mallinson|Mallinson|2005|p=5}} In 1878, when British general Wolsely came to Cyprus to formally establish British rule, he was met by the archbishop of [[Kition]] who, after welcoming him, requested that Britain cede Cyprus to Greece.{{sfn|Mallinson|Mallinson|2005|p=5}} Initially, the Greek Cypriots welcomed British rule because they were aware that the British had returned the [[Ionian Islands]] to Greece in 1864, and they were also hoping for British investment in Cyprus.{{sfn|Emerick|2014|p=117-18}} In 1912 the British government offered Greece to exchange Cyprus for a naval base in [[Argostoli]], [[Kefalonia]], in order to gain control of the [[Ionian sea]], an offer which was repeated in 1913. In 1915, the British offered several times Cyprus to Greece, in exchange for Greece's participation in World War I. But while Greece was undecided whether it should enter the War, the British government withdrew its offer.{{sfn|Richter|2007|loc= chapter First World War|p=157-194}} By 1915, the Greek Cypriots seeing that neither the British investment, nor Enosis, had materialised, increased their opposition to British rule.{{sfn|Emerick|2014|p=117-18}} In the beginning, the Enosis movement had only few supporters mainly from the upper classes.{{sfnm|1a1=Lange|1y=2011|1p=93|2a1=Bellingeri|2a2=Kappler|2y=2005|2p=21|3a1=Isachenko|3y=2012|3p=37|4a1=Richter|4y=2007|4pp=114-15}} But that was about to change as two groups of disappointed with the new ruler began to form: the Church and the Usurers.

Such movements were most often led by communists who aimed at establishing new Marxist societies. This was the case in China, Malaya, Vietnam, and Cuba. As a nationalist and anti-communist movement, EOKA had far more in common with the Irgun and Stern Gang in late-1940s Palestine.}}\n\nGrivas and Archbishop of Cyprus, [[Makarios III]], disagreed about the way to rid the island of British rule. Grivas rejected Makarios' attempt to limit the campaign to acts of sabotage, avoiding loss of life. Nevertheless, he shared Makarios' view that victory would be won by diplomatic means.<ref name=\"Newsinger96\">Newsinger, 2016, p. 96</ref> Grivas' goal was to subject the British to continued relentless harassment, making it clear to them that occupation carried a price, while keeping Enosis on the international diplomatic agenda.<ref name=\"Newsinger97\">Newsinger, 2016, p. 97</ref> The British response to the EOKA campaign was crucial in this regard: repression would on the one hand alienate the Greek Cypriot population from British rule, and on the other hand provide Makarios and the Greek government with a stick to beat the British with before the United Nations. EOKA would ensure that there was a Cyprus problem and demonstrate to the world that the British could not resolve it.<ref name=\"Newsinger97\" />\n\n===Preparations===\nGrivas carried out a first reconnaissance in Cyprus as early as July 1951.<ref name=\"Newsinger93\">Newsinger, 2016, p. 93</ref>\nMakarios was certainly skeptical, telling Grivas on one occasion that he would not find supporters for an armed struggle. The British shared the same view. Grivas finally arrived on the island in early November 1954 and set about establishing his underground network.<ref name=\"Newsinger94\">Newsinger, 2016, p. 94</ref> He recruited from the Cyprus Farmers' Union (PEK) in the villages and from the two main youth movements, the Church-controlled Christian Youth Movement (OHEN) and the nationalist Pancyprian Youth Movement (PEON) in the towns.<ref name=\"Newsinger94\" />{{sfn|French|2015|p=64-65}} Grivas intended to turn the youth of Cyprus 'into the seedbed of EOKA'.<ref name=\"Newsinger94\" /> The backbone of EOKA were the mountain groups, a conventional guerrilla force living in hidden camps in the forests, and the town groups, often continuing their civilian job or schooling.<ref name=\"Newsinger94\" /> Supporting this armed wing was the much broader National Front of Cyprus (EMAK), which provided EOKA with intelligence, supplies, weapons, medicines, recruits and safe houses, confronted the British on the streets with demonstrations and riots and conducted the propaganda offensive.<ref name=\"Newsinger94\" />\n\n==Armed campaign==\n[[File:Street riot in Nicosia 1956.jpg|thumb|Street riot in [[Nicosia]] during the [[Battle at Nicosia Hospital]] in 1956]]\n\n=== From April 1955 to the dismissal of governor Armitage  (October) ===\nThe armed struggle started on the night of March 29-April, 1955. A total of 18 bomb attacks occurred in various locations across the island. Most notable incidents were those of Nicosia by the group of [[Markos Drakos (EOKA fighter)|Markos Drakos]] as well as the demolition of the Cyprus Broadcasting Station's transmitter.{{sfn|Newsinger|2016|p=95}}{{sfn|French|2015|p=71}}{{sfn|Richter|2011|p=250}} The attacks were accompanied by a revolutionary proclamation signed by \"The leader, Digenes\". Grivas decided to keep his involvement secret at the moment and used the name of a Byzantine general who had defended Cyprus in the medieval era.{{sfn|Newsinger|2016|p=95}} The British, not expecting this turn of events, reinforced their local military bases (Dhekelia and Akrotiri) by transferring troops from Egypt.{{sfn|Richter|2011|p=250}}\n\nAt the end of April EOKA attacks temporarily paused, giving time to Grivas to organize the youth.{{sfn|Richter|2011|p=254|ps=: ANE (Valiant Youth of EOKA), a pupil's group was created, ANE had a branch in every school.}} A second offensive was launched on June 19 with coordinated bomb and grenade attacks against police stations, military installations and the homes of army officers and senior officials.{{sfn|Newsinger|2016|p=97}}{{sfn|Richter|2011|p=257-8}}{{sfn|French|2015|p=72}} One of those bombings demolished the building of the Famagusta Police headquarters.{{sfn|Newsinger|2016|p=97}} Those attacks were usually followed by sporadic incidents: shootings, bombings and increased public disorder.{{sfn|Newsinger|2016|p=97}} This second wave of EOKA attacks lasted until the end of June, totaling 204 attacks since the beginning of the armed resistance.{{sfn|Richter|2011|p=259}}{{sfn|French|2015|p=76}}\n\nIn August, two Special Branch members were assassinated in separate incidents. The raising of the Greek flag during demonstrations usually led to clashes with the colonial authorities, the latter removing it by force if necessary.{{sfn|Newsinger|2016|p=97}} Another major EOKA success was the escape from Kyrenia castle prison of 16 EOKA members including a number of key figures, such as Markos Drakos and [[Grigoris Afxentiou]].{{sfn|Newsinger|2016|p=97}}\n\n==== British reactions ====\nThe situation seemed to be deteriorating out of control and the British authorities attempted to safeguard their position in Cyprus by diplomatic maneuvering and a counterinsurgency offensive. The first involved playing the Greek and Turkish governments off against each other. Eden saw Turkey as \"the key protecting British interests\" in Cyprus.{{sfn|Newsinger|2016|p=97}} By the end of September, as the crisis was escalating, the British Government decided to replace [[Robert Perceval Armitage|governor Armitage]].{{sfn|French|2015|p=82}}\n\nIn Turkey, the public opinion was un-eased. Rumors were spreading in Turkish media that a slaughter of the Turkish Cypriot community was likely to occur. Though they were unfounded they led to nationalist reactions in the country and the government-sponsored anti-Greek [[Istanbul pogrom]] of September 1955.{{sfn|Richter|2011|pp=315-321}}. At the same time, during the London Trilateral Conference between Britain, Turkey and Greece, an agreement failed to materialize due to Turkish intransigence.{{sfn|Richter|2011|pp=299 & 313}}{{sfn|Holland|1998|p=73}}\n\nIn this fashion, British policy also aimed at the dramatic increase in recruitment of Turkish Cypriots. By the start of 1956, they had come to dominate the police force numbering 4,000 compared to less than 1,000 Greek Cypriots. The Turkish Cypriots were very much in the front line against EOKA. Inevitably, the use of Turkish Cypriot policemen against the Greek Cypriot community exacerbated relations between the two communities.{{sfn|Newsinger|2016|p=101}}\n\n=== From October 1955 to March 1956 (Operation Forward Victory, phase I) ===\n\nThe new British governor [[John Harding, 1st Baron Harding of Petherton|John Harding]] arrived at October 3.{{sfn|Holland|1998|p=83-84}} Harding sought to meet [[Makarios III|Archbishop Makarios]], and both agreed on commencing what became known as ''Harding-Makarios negotiations''.{{sfn|Holland|1998|p=84-85}}{{sfn|Richter|2011|p=370}} Increased security and stepping up military might was of Harding's priorities.{{sfn|Richter|2011|pp=370-72}} On November 26, Harding declared stated of Emergency- that meant among other, implementation of the death penalty for non-fatality crimes. {{sfn|Richter|2011|p=373}} Repressive legislation and troop reinforcements did not succeed. The Greek Cypriot population was hostile and the Special Branch was neutered.{{sfn|Newsinger|2016|p=99}} The British response was large-scale cordon and search operations which rarely resulted in arrests or the discovery of arms caches, but which invariably alienated those whose houses were searched or who were roughed up and dragged off to be screened. Collective punishments, far from undermining support for EOKA, only succeeded in making the Greek Cypriots more hostile to British rule.{{sfn|Newsinger|2016|p=99}} Moreover, Harding viewed Cyprus very much as a pawn in the [[Cold War]] global situation: on December 13 he banned AKEL and detained 128 of its leading members, effectively crippling the only political party in Cyprus that opposed EOKA.{{sfn|Newsinger|2016|p=99}}\n\nThe inevitable result was to increase sympathy for EOKA and to assist its recruitment efforts. The problem was that the Greek Cypriot community was overwhelmingly in favour of Enosis. Far from moderates emerging with whom Britain could do a deal.{{sfn|Newsinger|2016|p=100}} It was this popular support, enabling Grivas and his small band of guerrillas to take on the growing security apparatus that Harding was marshaling against him, that sustained the armed struggle.{{sfn|Newsinger|2016|p=100}} It became clear that EOKA did have an effective intelligence apparatus and that the guerrillas were often forewarned of security intentions. Schoolchildren, domestic servants, civilian personnel on the military bases, the police, all were enlisted by Grivas in the intelligence war while the security forces were operating in the dark.{{sfn|Newsinger|2016|p=100}}\n\nOperation \"Forward to Victory\" (Greek name) was launched on November 18 and was accompanied by several bomb attacks.{{sfn|Richter|2011|p=377|ps=: According to Richter, there were 50 bomb attacks that day.}} In the urban areas schoolchildren had a prominent role in the EOKA struggle. The ''Battle of Flags'', escalated during the Autumn of 1955 and peaked in January and February 1956- that kept British forces busy away from chasing down EOKA.{{sfn|French|2015|p=86}}{{sfn|Richter|2011|p=376}} Schoolboys were not only participating in riots and stone-throwing against the police, but some of them were also trained to throw bombs and carry assassinations.{{sfn|Richter|2011|p=383}} Bombs by guerrillas and youngsters were thrown at British personnel houses, police stations and army camps.{{sfn|Richter|2011|p=481-82}}{{sfn|French|2015|p=86-88}} In some cases, EOKA members managed to steal some weaponry.{{sfn|French|2015|p=87}} The British were never to succeed completely eliminating EOKA agents from the police force.{{sfn|Newsinger|2016|p=101}}\n\nThe struggle continued in the mountains as the guerrillas expanded their network in the Troodos mountains. However, due to harsh winter conditions in addition to certain British military pressure, the activity of EOKA temporarily eased.{{sfn|French|2015|p=88-89}} By the end of February 1956 the British were involved in suppressing a veritable schoolchildren revolt that left one boy shot dead and the island's school system almost completely closed down.{{sfn|Newsinger|2016|p=101}}\n\n=== March 1956 to March 1957 (operation Victory, phase II) ===\n\nAfter the failure of Makarios-Harding negotiations the British government abruptly exiled Makarios to [[Seychelles]] on March 9, 1956.{{sfn|Richter|2011|p=416-422}} This triggered a week long general strike followed by a dramatic increase in EOKA activity: 246 attacks until March 31 including an unsuccessful attempt to assassinate Harding. The offensive continued into April and May and the British casualties averaged two killed every week.{{sfn|Newsinger|2016|p=102}} While Harding's forces were making ground up in the mountains,{{sfn|Richter|2011|pp=501-512|ps=: In the sub-chapter \"The British counter-attack\"}} EOKA guerrillas and youth were trying to assassinate members of the security forces at their leisure time or alleged traitors.{{Sfn|Richter|2011|p=496}}\n\nEOKA focused its activity to urban areas during this period. House bombings and riots, mostly by schoolboys, forced army to keep forces away from the mountains where EOKA's main fighters where hiding. Apart from individual citizens or soldiers in their leisure time, army and police facilities where attacked totaling 104 house bombings, 53 riots, 136 acts of Sabotage, 403 ambushes, 35 attacks on police, 38 attacks on soldiers and 43 raids on police stations.{{efn|Some of the attacks of the attacks against civilians drew world attention and were used for propaganda purposes by the British authorities.

On 16 June 1956, the bombing of a restaurant by EOKA led to the death of William P. Boteler, a [[CIA]] officer working under [[State Department|diplomatic]] cover.

Although Grivas escaped, the Troodos operations had some success for the British: 20 guerrillas and 50 weapons were captured.

The last incident overshadowed the first real success against the EOKA guerrilla forces.{{sfn|Newsinger|2016|p=103}}\n\nOn August 9 the British authorities hanged three more EOKA prisoners; however, Grivas did not retaliate this time. Widespread strikes were held in protest.{{sfn|Newsinger|2016|p=104}} On November 1956 due to the [[Suez Crisis]] large numbers of British troops were transferred off Cyprus allowing Grivas to launch a new offensive. EOKA launched a wave of attacks in what would became for the British \"Black November\" with a total of 416 attacks, 39 killed 21 of them British.

Another aspect that Richter highlights is that many claims of torture were made as the alleged victims were afraid for their lives as it was punished by death to speak to the British.{{sfn|Richter|2011|pp=666-668}} David French on the other hand views that most - but not all- claims of torture were a propaganda tool of EOKA.{{sfn|French|2015|p=222-24}} In general Harding failed to win over the Greek Cypriot population especially when his security forces resorted to this kind of measures.{{sfn|Newsinger|2016|p=107}}\n\n====Campaign against Greek Cypriot groups ====\nInitially, EOKA was intimidating the population not to co-operate with the security forces, but steadily the definition of traitor broadened as the security forces had some successes EOKA at the end of 1956.{{sfn|French|2015|p=158-59}} EOKA members who had spoken to the security forces under interrogation were also considered as traitors and Grivas was in favour of the death penalty in such case. Incidences happened where EOKA guerrillas killed others by their own initiative and not solely based on accusations for treason. The killings took place in public.{{sfn|French|2015|p=163-64}}{{sfn|Holland|1998|p=148|ps=:According to Holland \"In early August [1956] EOKA had unleashed a series of urban assassinations in which twenty-one Greek 'traitors' had been killed\u2014the victims often sought out in cafes to accentuate the public ritual of the horror\"}} Such activity peaked especially during summer-autumn 1956.{{sfn|French|2015|p=163}} The Greek Cypriot Left and in particular the communist party ([[AKEL]]) were also targeted. The later aimed at a political role in the Greek Cypriot community challenging EOKA's claim that Makarios was the sole leader of the community. As AKEL was growing in numbers it was practically denying Makarios' role. The British delicately fueled this hostility and in August 1957 a second wave of intra-Greek violence broke out.{{sfn|Holland|1998|p=203}} Due to intimidation methods and targeting civilians towards local population a number of scholars characterized EOKA as a terrorist organisation.{{sfnm|1a1=Abrahms|1a2=Lula|1y=2012 |1pp=46-62|2a1=Crenshaw||2a2=Pimlott|2y=2015|2loc= Chapter Terrorism in Cyprus|3a1=Cronin|3y=2009|3p=73-93|4a1=Edwards|4y=2018|4loc=Abstract}} Another similar wave broke out in April- October 1958 when a peace agreement was imminent.{{sfn|French|2015|p=166-67}}{{sfn|Richter|2011|p=710-212|ps=: in the subchapter \"Grivas unleash attack against the Left}} AKEL held massive demonstrations and sought the help of Makarios which he granted.{{sfn|French|2015|p=166-67}}{{sfn|Richter|2011|p=710-712b|ps=: in the subchapter \"Grivas unleash attack against the Left\". Richter also notes that AKEL approached Makarios who was antithetical to Grivas tactics. That was the beginning of a relationship that would last to time}}\n\n====End of truce====\nDuring this period the British were openly tolerating the Turkish Cypriot paramilitary organisations. The British had deliberately set out to use the Turkish Cypriot community on the island and the Turks government as a means of blocking the demand for Enosis.{{sfn|Newsinger|2016|p=109}} They had effectively allied themselves with the Turkish minority and turned them as the overwhelming majority in the police force. This had now got out of control as far as the British were concerned, but nevertheless they still managed to exploit the situation.{{sfn|Newsinger|2016|p=109}}\n\nThe truce against the collonial authorities lasted until the 28th of October 1957 ([[Ohi Day]], Greek national holiday) when Harold Macmillan, British minister of foreign affairs, declined a proposal by Makarios.{{sfn|Richter|2011|p=106}}\n\n===December 1957\u2013August 1958 (Foot governorship and intercommunal violence) ===\n\nSir Hugh Foot arrived in Cyprus in December 1956, when it was obvious that a military victory for the British was not imminent.{{sfn|French|2015|p=241}}{{sfn|Holland|1998|p=213}} Grivas at that time was planning a gradual escalation of EOKA's attacks on the British forces but in mid-December, he called for a truce to give space for negotiations to take place. The truce broke on 4th March 1958 when a new wave of attacks was unleashed but this time, Grivas ordered his guerillas not to attack Turkish Cypriots to avoid [[Cypriot intercommunal violence|intercommunal violence]] that could lead to partition.{{sfn|French|2015|p=246-47}}\n\n==== EOKA and Turkish Cypriots ====\n\nThe Turkish Cypriot community objected to Enosis long before the 1950s from fear that unification with Greece would lead to their persecution and expulsion, a fear based on the fate of [[Cretan Turks]] after Crete's union with Greece.

[[MacMillan Plan(Cyprus)|MacMillan Plan]] put an effort in this direction. Greeks rejected the plan as they saw it as an open door leading to the partition of the island and Grivas cancelled the truce on September 7th.{{sfn|French|2015|p=270-73}} As such a new armed campaign was launched and the targets differed significantly from the previous periods. Grivas ordered guerillas to \"''strike indiscriminately at every English person wherever they can be found''\" resulting in the death of 8 British citizens in 104 incidents attacks in the following two months.{{sfn|French|2015|p=274-75}} But while the military force of EOKA was growing, Greek Cypriots were getting frustrated from the intercommunal violence and the struggle against the British. Makarios hinted in an interview that he was ready to shift his stance and accept an independent Cyprus. This development infuriated Grivas but was backed by influential members of the Greek Cypriot Community. EOKA was losing its broad support base. {{sfn|French|2015|p=283-85}}\n\nDuring the last months of 1958, all parties had reasons to favour a compromise. Greek Cypriot side was afraid that partition was becoming more and more imminent, Greece was anxious that the ongoing situation could lead to a war with Turkey, Turkey had to manage the ongoing crises at its eastern borders and the British didn't want to see NATO destabilizing because of Greek-Turkish war. On 5 December, the foreign ministers of Greece and Turkey acknowledged the situation and a series of meetings were arranged that resulted in [[London-Z\u00fcrich Agreements]]. This was a compromise solution in which Cyprus would become an independent and sovereign country.{{sfn|French|2015|p=289}} Both Makarios and Grivas accepted the agreements with a heavy heart, instead, Turkish-Cypriot leadership was enthusiastic about the compromise. On 9th of March 1959, Grivas issued a leaflet declaring his acceptance to London agreements.{{sfn|French|2015|p=290-92}}\n\nAccording to historian [[Heinz A.

The origins of Enosis date back to 1821, the year when the [[Greek War of Independence]] commenced, and the archbishop of Cyprus, his archdeacon, and three bishops were beheaded, amongst other atrocities.

The first involved playing the Greek and Turkish governments off against each other. Eden saw Turkey as \"the key protecting British interests\" in Cyprus.{{sfn|Newsinger|2016|p=97}} By the end of September, as the crisis was escalating, the British Government decided to replace [[Robert Perceval Armitage|governor Armitage]].{{sfn|French|2015|p=82}}\n\nIn Turkey, the public opinion was un-eased. Rumors were spreading in Turkish media that a slaughter of the Turkish Cypriot community was likely to occur. Though they were unfounded they led to nationalist reactions in the country and the government-sponsored anti-Greek [[Istanbul pogrom]] of September 1955.{{sfn|Richter|2011|pp=315-321}}. At the same time, during the London Trilateral Conference between Britain, Turkey and Greece, an agreement failed to materialize due to Turkish intransigence.{{sfn|Richter|2011|pp=299 & 313}}{{sfn|Holland|1998|p=73}}\n\nIn this fashion, British policy also aimed at the dramatic increase in recruitment of Turkish Cypriots. By the start of 1956, they had come to dominate the police force numbering 4,000 compared to less than 1,000 Greek Cypriots. The Turkish Cypriots were very much in the front line against EOKA. Inevitably, the use of Turkish Cypriot policemen against the Greek Cypriot community exacerbated relations between the two communities.{{sfn|Newsinger|2016|p=101}}\n\n=== From October 1955 to March 1956 (Operation Forward Victory, phase I) ===\n\nThe new British governor [[John Harding, 1st Baron Harding of Petherton|John Harding]] arrived at October 3.{{sfn|Holland|1998|p=83-84}} Harding sought to meet [[Makarios III|Archbishop Makarios]], and both agreed on commencing what became known as ''Harding-Makarios negotiations''.{{sfn|Holland|1998|p=84-85}}{{sfn|Richter|2011|p=370}} Increased security and stepping up military might was of Harding's priorities.{{sfn|Richter|2011|pp=370-72}} On November 26, Harding declared stated of Emergency- that meant among other, implementation of the death penalty for non-fatality crimes. {{sfn|Richter|2011|p=373}} Repressive legislation and troop reinforcements did not succeed. The Greek Cypriot population was hostile and the Special Branch was neutered.{{sfn|Newsinger|2016|p=99}} The British response was large-scale cordon and search operations which rarely resulted in arrests or the discovery of arms caches, but which invariably alienated those whose houses were searched or who were roughed up and dragged off to be screened. Collective punishments, far from undermining support for EOKA, only succeeded in making the Greek Cypriots more hostile to British rule.{{sfn|Newsinger|2016|p=99}} Moreover, Harding viewed Cyprus very much as a pawn in the [[Cold War]] global situation: on December 13 he banned AKEL and detained 128 of its leading members, effectively crippling the only political party in Cyprus that opposed EOKA.{{sfn|Newsinger|2016|p=99}}\n\nThe inevitable result was to increase sympathy for EOKA and to assist its recruitment efforts. The problem was that the Greek Cypriot community was overwhelmingly in favour of Enosis. Far from moderates emerging with whom Britain could do a deal.{{sfn|Newsinger|2016|p=100}} It was this popular support, enabling Grivas and his small band of guerrillas to take on the growing security apparatus that Harding was marshaling against him, that sustained the armed struggle.{{sfn|Newsinger|2016|p=100}} It became clear that EOKA did have an effective intelligence apparatus and that the guerrillas were often forewarned of security intentions. Schoolchildren, domestic servants, civilian personnel on the military bases, the police, all were enlisted by Grivas in the intelligence war while the security forces were operating in the dark.{{sfn|Newsinger|2016|p=100}}\n\nOperation \"Forward to Victory\" (Greek name) was launched on November 18 and was accompanied by several bomb attacks.{{sfn|Richter|2011|p=377|ps=: According to Richter, there were 50 bomb attacks that day.}} In the urban areas schoolchildren had a prominent role in the EOKA struggle.

However, due to harsh winter conditions in addition to certain British military pressure, the activity of EOKA temporarily eased.{{sfn|French|2015|p=88-89}} By the end of February 1956 the British were involved in suppressing a veritable schoolchildren revolt that left one boy shot dead and the island's school system almost completely closed down.{{sfn|Newsinger|2016|p=101}}\n\n=== March 1956 to March 1957 (operation Victory, phase II) ===\n\nAfter the failure of Makarios-Harding negotiations the British government abruptly exiled Makarios to [[Seychelles]] on March 9, 1956.{{sfn|Richter|2011|p=416-422}} This triggered a week long general strike followed by a dramatic increase in EOKA activity: 246 attacks until March 31 including an unsuccessful attempt to assassinate Harding.

The last incident overshadowed the first real success against the EOKA guerrilla forces.{{sfn|Newsinger|2016|p=103}}\n\nOn August 9 the British authorities hanged three more EOKA prisoners; however, Grivas did not retaliate this time. Widespread strikes were held in protest.{{sfn|Newsinger|2016|p=104}} On November 1956 due to the [[Suez Crisis]] large numbers of British troops were transferred off Cyprus allowing Grivas to launch a new offensive.

According to Heinz Richter, while police or army was generally lawful, the British turned a blind eye to interrogators many of whom were deliberately under-educated Turkish Cypriot who were against ''Enosis''. Another aspect that Richter highlights is that many claims of torture were made as the alleged victims were afraid for their lives as it was punished by death to speak to the British.{{sfn|Richter|2011|pp=666-668}} David French on the other hand views that most - but not all- claims of torture were a propaganda tool of EOKA.{{sfn|French|2015|p=222-24}} In general Harding failed to win over the Greek Cypriot population especially when his security forces resorted to this kind of measures.{{sfn|Newsinger|2016|p=107}}\n\n====Campaign against Greek Cypriot groups ====\nInitially, EOKA was intimidating the population not to co-operate with the security forces, but steadily the definition of traitor broadened as the security forces had some successes EOKA at the end of 1956.{{sfn|French|2015|p=158-59}} EOKA members who had spoken to the security forces under interrogation were also considered as traitors and Grivas was in favour of the death penalty in such case.

[[MacMillan Plan(Cyprus)|MacMillan Plan]] put an effort in this direction. Greeks rejected the plan as they saw it as an open door leading to the partition of the island and Grivas cancelled the truce on September 7th.{{sfn|French|2015|p=270-73}} As such a new armed campaign was launched and the targets differed significantly from the previous periods.

Makarios hinted in an interview that he was ready to shift his stance and accept an independent Cyprus. This development infuriated Grivas but was backed by influential members of the Greek Cypriot Community. EOKA was losing its broad support base. {{sfn|French|2015|p=283-85}}\n\nDuring the last months of 1958, all parties had reasons to favour a compromise. Greek Cypriot side was afraid that partition was becoming more and more imminent, Greece was anxious that the ongoing situation could lead to a war with Turkey, Turkey had to manage the ongoing crises at its eastern borders and the British didn't want to see NATO destabilizing because of Greek-Turkish war. On 5 December, the foreign ministers of Greece and Turkey acknowledged the situation and a series of meetings were arranged that resulted in [[London-Z\u00fcrich Agreements]]. This was a compromise solution in which Cyprus would become an independent and sovereign country.{{sfn|French|2015|p=289}} Both Makarios and Grivas accepted the agreements with a heavy heart, instead, Turkish-Cypriot leadership was enthusiastic about the compromise. On 9th of March 1959, Grivas issued a leaflet declaring his acceptance to London agreements.{{sfn|French|2015|p=290-92}}\n\nAccording to historian [[Heinz A.

Before 2005, tactics included staying out of dangerous urban areas except on patrols, with US forces returning to their [[Forward operating base|bases]] each night. These patrols had little success in turning back the insurgency because local Iraqis who feared retaliation would very rarely assist in identifying them to US forces. McMaster deployed his soldiers into Tal Afar on a permanent basis, and once the local population grew confident that they weren't going to withdraw nightly, the citizens began providing information on the insurgents, enabling US forces to target and defeat them.<ref name = \"adapt\" /><ref name=\"warLessons\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/76ec21b8-8565-11e0-ae32-00144feabdc0.html#axzz1TlWEwjSQ|title=Lessons from war's factory floor|work=[[Financial Times]]|author=Tim Harford|date=May 23, 2011|access-date=August 2, 2011|author-link=Tim Harford}}</ref> After hearing of McMaster's [[counterinsurgency]] success in Tal Afar, Vice President [[Dick Cheney]] invited McMaster to personally brief him on the situation in Iraq and give an assessment on what changes needed to be made to American strategy.<ref name=\"Cheney2011\">{{cite book|author=Dick Cheney|title=In My Time: A Personal and Political Memoir|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OEyfnCb_MbEC&pg=PA440|date=August 30, 2011|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=978-1439176238|pages=440\u2013}}</ref>\n\nMcMaster passed command of the 3rd ACR on June 29, 2006, and joined the [[International Institute for Strategic Studies]] in London, as a Senior Research Associate tasked to \"conduct research to identify opportunities for improved multi-national cooperation and political-military integration in the areas of counterinsurgency, counter-terrorism, and state building\", and to devise \"better tactics to battle terrorism.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.iiss.org/en/persons/hr-s-mcmaster|title=International Institute for Strategic Studies \u2013 H.R.

Before 2005, tactics included staying out of dangerous urban areas except on patrols, with US forces returning to their [[Forward operating base|bases]] each night. These patrols had little success in turning back the insurgency because local Iraqis who feared retaliation would very rarely assist in identifying them to US forces. McMaster deployed his soldiers into Tal Afar on a permanent basis, and once the local population grew confident that they weren't going to withdraw nightly, the citizens began providing information on the insurgents, enabling US forces to target and defeat them.<ref name = \"adapt\" /><ref name=\"warLessons\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/76ec21b8-8565-11e0-ae32-00144feabdc0.html#axzz1TlWEwjSQ|title=Lessons from war's factory floor|work=[[Financial Times]]|author=Tim Harford|date=May 23, 2011|access-date=August 2, 2011|author-link=Tim Harford}}</ref> After hearing of McMaster's [[counterinsurgency]] success in Tal Afar, Vice President [[Dick Cheney]] invited McMaster to personally brief him on the situation in Iraq and give an assessment on what changes needed to be made to American strategy.<ref name=\"Cheney2011\">{{cite book|author=Dick Cheney|title=In My Time: A Personal and Political Memoir|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OEyfnCb_MbEC&pg=PA440|date=August 30, 2011|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=978-1439176238|pages=440\u2013}}</ref>\n\nMcMaster passed command of the 3rd ACR on June 29, 2006, and joined the [[International Institute for Strategic Studies]] in London, as a Senior Research Associate tasked to \"conduct research to identify opportunities for improved multi-national cooperation and political-military integration in the areas of counterinsurgency, counter-terrorism, and state building\", and to devise \"better tactics to battle terrorism.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.iiss.org/en/persons/hr-s-mcmaster|title=International Institute for Strategic Studies \u2013 H.R.

The series ran from 1999 to 2001 on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]]'s [[Fox Kids]] block.<ref name=Perlmutter>{{cite book |last1=Perlmutter |first1=David |title=The Encyclopedia of American Animated Television Shows |date=2018 |publisher=Rowman & Littlefield |isbn=978-1538103739 |pages=422-423}}</ref>\n\n== Background ==\n26 half-hour episodes were produced by [[Saban Entertainment]], in conjunction with the [[Vancouver]]-based [[Ocean Productions]] voice cast, who had worked with Saban on other projects \u2014 such as ''[[Spider-Man (1994 TV series)|Spider-Man The Animated Series]]'' and ''[[Dragon Ball Z]]''. The show's theme song was composed and performed by Jeremy Sweet. Before beginning its proper run in 2000, ''NASCAR Racers'' premiered as a special three-part TV movie on November 11, 1999, although subsequent re-airings have the first three episodes separated from each other. It ended in 2001, with reruns airing on [[Disney]]'s [[Jetix]] after the company's purchase of the Saban Entertainment library. The show was produced before [[NASCAR on Fox|Fox showed NASCAR races]], and the show's broadcast history only overlapped with the network's coverage of the real series for one month.\n\n== Media ==\n=== Video game ===\nA video game called '''''NASCAR Racers''''' was published in 2000 for [[Microsoft Windows]] and [[Game Boy Color]] by Hasbro and developed by Software Creations (PC) and Digital Eclipse (GBC). A [[PlayStation]] version was planned but cancelled before release.\n\n=== Books ===\n''NASCAR Racers'' books were authored by Gene Hult under the name J. E. Bright, and published by HarperEntertainment.\n\n==Premise==\nWhile real life NASCAR tracks are mainly ovals, ''NASCAR Racers'' is anything but. The racers compete on a wide variety of courses, including road course, off-road, mountain, and Motorsphere. The Motorsphere track starts with a typical race track leading into a sphere, then tracks are wrapped around the inner surface of the sphere.\n\nThe NASCAR Unlimited Division features cutting edge, over-the-top technologies (from the show's point of view). To protect drivers from crashes, each race car has an inner Rescue Racer that ejects from the outer body if an accident happens. XPT racers, introduced in season 2, are the new race cars for Team Fastex. XPT racers use atomic fuel run by forced-combustion systems. Nitro Racers contain high-flux fusion units that can get maximum power out of atomic fuel.\n\nThe change in body design from the XPT racers to the Nitro Racers was similar to the Sprint Cup transition to the \"car of tomorrow\". XPT racers were sleeker than the boxy Nitro Racers.\n\nThe characters often race on simulators to hone their skills before actual races; this is also done by real NASCAR drivers.\n===Team Fastex===\n; Mark \"Charger\" McCutchen ([[Ian James Corlett]]) (4 Wins):Mark is the grandson of Mack McCutchen and son of Mack McCutchen, Jr., two former NASCAR stars and a naturally skilled driver in his own right. Mark wants more than anything to live up to his family's racing legacy and manages to win the championship for Team Fastex in season 1 after a heated race against Kent Steel. He was Lyle Owens' main rival even before the Unlimited Division started and also has a crush on Megan Fassler. He drives car #204.\n\n; Megan \"Spitfire\" Fassler ([[Kathleen Barr]]) (3 Wins): Megan is the daughter of Jack Fassler, owner of Team Fastex, and the only female member of the team. At first her father disapproves about letting her race for the team, but he changes his mind early in the series. In season 2, Garner Rexton hires a woman to pose as Megan's real mother to confuse Megan about her past. Afterwards, Megan forms a team called the Spitfire Racers with Eve \"Wild Card\" Kilder, \"Chrome\" and Zorina. Eventually, she finds out about her true past and rejoins Fastex. She drives car #101.\n\n; Carlos \"Stunts\" Rey ([[Rino Romano]]) (4 Wins): A former champion motorcycle racer, Carlos joined NASCAR to win money to pay for research for his ill father's ongoing medical treatments. Although he takes on several side projects such as a daredevil stunt driving and numerous commercial endorsements, his strong sense of loyalty keeps him with Team Fastex, even after losing most of his savings to a con man and being pressured by Garner Rexton to betray his teammates. He drives car #404.\n\n; Steve \"Flyer\" Sharp ([[Roger Cross|Roger R. Cross]]) (2 Wins):Steve was a fighter pilot in the [[United States Air Force|U.S. Air Force]] years ago, but had to retire when he was exposed to a gaseous cloud of chemical nerve agent during a mission. He survived, but the nerve gas left him prone to sudden attacks of extreme nervousness, shaking and sweating. Steve joined NASCAR to prove to himself that he can still handle a high-pressure situation, but he knows that he is always at risk of an attack. He drives car #808.\n\n; Jack Fassler ([[Richard Newman (actor)|Richard Newman]]): Owner of Team Fastex, husband of Libby Fassler and adoptive father of Megan Fassler. A key founder of the NASCAR Unlimited division, Jack used most of his savings and a large bank loan to launch the races, but the bank from which he borrowed the money was bought out by his business rival Garner Rexton shortly after, effectively putting Jack in direct debt to Rexton and making beating his rival essential to pay back his debts. When he chose the team members for the first season, Jack disapproved of two things: letting Lyle Owens become a member of Team Fastex and letting Megan race for the team. He soon changes his mind about Megan since a four-driver team is needed to compete for the team championship.\n\n; Douglas \"Duck\" Dunaka ([[Dale Wilson (actor)|Dale Wilson]]):Duck is the crew chief of the team and a master mechanic, although he had previously been a driver much earlier in his career. His past experience compels him to drive one race for Team Fastex as \"Rubber Ducky\" (Car #859) in the season 2 episode \"Duck Unlimited\" after Megan briefly leaves the team. Duck is very fond of greasy comfort food and has a knack for using his favorite tool, duct tape, to fix just about anything. He also has a daughter, Shelby, who hangs around the garage with Miles on occasion.\n\n; Lugnut: Team Fastex mechanic who gets hired instantly by Jack and Duck at the start of the second season when he wanders into the garage and fixes a problem with Stunts' car in mere seconds which Duck was completely stumped on. He later fixes a suspension problem on Stunts' car during a pit stop, which prompts Jack and Duck to offer him a raise. Later in the season, he serves as Crew Chief during the race Duck competes in and forms a friendship with Miles. Although very skilled as a mechanic, he is also very clumsy and has a tendency to trip and launch items that usually land on Duck.\n\n===Team Rexcor===\n; Lyle \"The Collector\" Owens ([[Scott McNeil]]) (2 Wins):A ruthless, cruel and arrogant driver considered a [[threat]] to every NASCAR team. With his deadly driving skills, he has been known to cause crashes from which he likes to collect a piece of the car afterward as a trophy, from which he got the nickname \"The Collector\". Lyle is \"Charger\" McCutchen's number one rival from even when they were both candidates to join Team Fastex, which factored into Garner Rexton later hiring him for Team Rexcor. Lyle is fired from Rexcor at the end of season 1, but is re-hired early in season 2 after he suffers a mutation due to contact with [[toxic waste]], making him larger, stronger and more aggressive than any human being while giving him a hideously scarred face. He drives car #606.\n\n; Hondo \"Specter\" Hines (1 Win):Hondo is one of the spookiest drivers in NASCAR. While very little is known of his past, he has super driving skills, is an expert bully, and is not above cheating to win races. Hondo specializes in sneaking up behind a rival car and wrecking it before his opponent even knows that he's there, just like a ghost, but he'll often team up with his Rexcor teammates to wreck an opponent and slip ahead of the pack. When not driving, he can usually be seen wearing dark [[sunglasses]], even indoors. He drives car #303.\n\n; Zorina (1 Win): A former model and body builder, Zorina is a very arrogant, and aggressive driver that will push anyone, even her own teammates, aside to clear her way to the front of the pack. Described by fellow drivers as \"no lady\", she is never intimidated by anyone, especially male competitors who might see her as a push-over. In season 2, Garner Rexton fires her and replaces her with Tanker, forcing Zorina to ask Megan Fassler for a job driving with the Spitfire Racers, to which Megan wholeheartedly agrees. She drives car #505.\n\n; Diesel \"Junker\" Spitz:Diesel is a former driver for a [[Contract killing|hitmen]] gang in Europe that stole and resold expensive [[Vehicle|vehicles]] on the [[black market]]. He was discovered overseas sabotaging rival race cars by Garner Rexton, who quickly recruited him to drive for Team Rexcor. Diesel is a very skilled driver, but he seems to take more enjoyment in wrecking other cars than actually competing to win races, which gave him the nickname \"Junker\". Diesel speaks in a broken English-German dialect and his voice resembles that of actor and politician [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]]. He drives car #707.\n\n; Garner Rexton ([[Ron Halder]]):The [[Leadership|leader]] of Team Rexcor and usually the mastermind of anything that causes damages and disaster in the NASCAR Unlimited series, as well as the main antagonist of the show. He is a very arrogant, vengeful, manipulative, sadistic, and bloodthirsty person, using his wealth and powerful influence to control others around him and force them to do his dirty work. Many years ago, Garner was deeply in love with Jack Fassler's wife, Libby, but was left heartbroken when she rejected him and went on to marry his rival. Since then, Garner's only motivation in life has been the systematic destruction of Jack Fassler and his racing empire, and he will stop at nothing to achieve his revenge. He confirmed in one episode that he was the one who introduced Libby to Jack, for which Jack stated he'll always owe Garner for. In addition to racing, Garner is also shown to be heavily involved in the production and overseas trafficking of illegal chemical weapons like the one \"Flyer\" was exposed to. Garner was ultimately banned from NASCAR for repeat offences involving race tampering after one person, \"Stunts\", finally had the nerve to stand up to him.\n\n; Spex ([[Richard Newman (actor)|Richard Newman]]):Team Rexcor crew chief and Garner Rexton's right-hand man. Spex is a [[cyborg]] who uses his special body tools to repair any damage to the cars. He also has a monitor screen built into his chest to provide others with face-to-face communication with Garner Rexton. He has a very cold and unfeeling nature and never hesitates to cheat in anyway, which is reflective of his programming to always be loyal to Garner Rexton's cause.\n\n; Kent \"Demolisher\" Steel (1 Win):Kent is an [[Android (robot)|android]] designed for the destruction of Team Fastex. He first appears at the end of season 1 as a very reckless, powerful and destructive driver resembling a human. Being an android, however, he has no fear of death or any other human limitations, allowing him to achieve things on a race track no human driver could. He was ultimately unmasked when \"Charger\" McCutchen and Lyle Owens (who was driving under an alter-ego) reluctantly teamed up to pass him and caused him to crash, revealing his robotic exo-skeleton and leading to Team Rexcor's season disqualification for cheating. He later appears in episodes \"Chain Reaction\" as he tries to sabotage the fuel for the other teams, and \"Rumble\" as one of the drivers used in the free-for-all race. He drove car #500.\n\n===Other Team Rexcor===\n; \"Redline\" O'Rourke (1 Win) ([[Kirby Morrow]]):This driver is a mystery to many people in the NASCAR Unlimited series. His first name is unknown. No one knows how he got to be so good, but he can apparently use his extraordinary driving skills to get past any car he wants, making him a strong adversary and the number-two rival to \"Charger\" McCutchen. While he appears confident and a bit cocky, he always races fairly and honorably. However, he dislikes to lose and even refuses to celebrate a third-place finish with the Spitfire Racers. Like \"Charger\", he has a crush on Megan Fassler. He drives car #119.\n\n; Phil \"Octane\" Knox:Known for the speed and power of his car, Phil appears as a friendly and good-natured rival to Team Fastex, but he secretly works for Rexcor. After \"Flyer\" saves his life after a mishap on a qualifying run, he and \"Flyer\" become good friends, but Phil later poisons \"Flyer\" with a powerful hallucinogenic drug, leading to a series of very dangerous on-track incidents where Flyer thought that he was back in his fighter jet. Later Phil tries to poison \"Flyer\" again just before the final race, but accidentally poisons himself instead, making him think that he was about to go over a waterfall. He drives car #420.\n\n; Tanker:His real name is unknown. Years ago, he was in the army and a very skilled tank operator. Just like how \"Flyer's\" car is modeled like a fighter jet, \"Tanker's\" car resembles a tank, which he uses to batter and bang up all the other cars in his way. The rocket booster on the top of his car also doubles as a [[cannon]], which he never hesitates to use on opponents. Noting his aggressive driving style and growing rivalry with \"Flyer\", Garner Rexton decides to add \"Tanker\" to Team Rexcor near the end of season 2, where he replaces Zorina. He drives car #817.\n\n; Grim Repo: A very tall and silent racer whose true name is unknown. He first appears at the beginning of season 2 together with the four other new racers (\"Redline\", \"Tanker\", \"Chrome\" and \"Octane\") and is rarely seen outside his car afterward. He is never shown without his skull-like helmet, so his real face is never seen and he also usually wears a cloak or cape, even when driving. He once races for Team Rexcor, in the episode \"Rumble\", and seems to form a rivalry with \"Stunts\", who likes to poke fun at his nickname. He drives car #860.\n\n; Chrome: She is the only female member of the new drivers from season 2 and uses her shiny chrome-plated car as an effective weapon in distracting other drivers in order to slip ahead of them on the race course. While very little is known of her past, her cool and confident attitude often intimidates her opponents. Late in Season 2, she joins Megan Fassler's Spitfire Racers team. She drives car #232. \n\n; Eve \"Wild Card\" Kilder:A professional stunt driver whom Garner Rexton used to lure Carlos \"Stunts\" Rey away from Team Fastex. She is arrested in season 1 for trying to kill Team Fastex with some rogue [[fireworks]] during a team stunt at the raceway. While in prison, Lyle Owens negotiates the loan of the car she used so he can compete undercover in the final race of season 1 using the nickname \"Wild Card\". She is later released in season 2, takes back the car and assumes the \"Wild Card\" nickname herself in order to join Megan Fassler's team. She is in love with Carlos \"Stunts\" Rey, but he does not return her affections after the fireworks incident. She drives car #413.\n\n===Other Team Fastex===\n; Libby Fassler: Wife of Jack Fassler and adoptive mother of Megan Fassler. A scientist who works to protect the world's rain forests, she spends a lot of time away from the racing community. In one episode, she is kidnapped by bounty hunters secretly hired by Garner Rexton, who proceeds to send his race team to try and save Libby so he can win her back to his side. However, this plan is undone by Team Fastex. Garner Rexton's love for Libby is his biggest motivation for revenge on Jack, but Libby and Jack both appear to be unaware of his feelings.\n\n; Miles McCutchen ([[Andrew Francis]]):Younger brother of Mark McCutchen who aspires to race like his older sibling. He often can be seen helping Duck and Lugnut in the pits with odd jobs, but occasionally proves himself an even more valuable asset to the team, such as when he discovered Kent Steel's secret of being an android. He is also good friends with Duck's daughter, Shelby.\n\n; Farrell Longstreet: A former racing colleague of \"Charger\" McCutchen's father who comes out of retirement to race in the Unlimited Series in season 2, driving car #993. He appears to suffer a severe injury in a crash \"Charger\" accidentally caused and is forced to retire again, but the injuries were actually a ploy by Garner Rexton to get \"Charger\" to feel upset and throw him off his game. After being reminded of his friendship with Mack McCutchen Jr., Longstreet betrays Rexton by driving \"Charger's\" car as a relief driver in the final race of the season, keeping Team Fastex in contention.\n\n===Commentator===\n; Mike Hauger: A television presenter for Sports Network Interglobal Television (SNIT), alongside Pat Anther, who covers and commentates the NASCAR Unlimited Series races.\n\n; Pat Anther: A television presenter for Sports Network Interglobal Television (SNIT), alongside Mike Hauger, who covers and commentates the NASCAR Unlimited Series races.\n\n==Episodes==\n===Season 1 (1999\u20132000)===\n{{Episode table |background=#226621|overall=6|title=30|writer=19|airdate=20|prodcode=8|episodes=\n\n{{Episode list  | LineColor = 226621\n |Title=The Real Thing|\n |WrittenBy=Michael Edens\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|1999|11|20}}\n |ProdCode=101\n |EpisodeNumber=1\n |ShortSummary= There is a new [[NASCAR]] series called the Unlimited Series, and team Fastex owner Jack Fassler has hired four racers: Mark \"Charger\" McCutchen, Steve \"Flyer\" Sharp, Carlos \"Stunts\" Rey and Lyle \"Collector\" Owens.

But when the thieves come back to take the component, Flyer's car has been painted in red and white for the \"All-American\" highway cross-country race (like the American flag).

After Lyle Owens was fired and Steele hired, Fastex was also working on a \"secret new weapon\" for the last race: a supercar that pushes the performance envelope far beyond the team's regular cars. After the supercar lost control and disintegrated, Duck realized that the car was too hard to control for any human being, though Jack was very confident of victory. With the individual driving championship at stake, the Fastex drivers, each with an individual compulsion to win, no longer race as a team. Disunited, they fall easily as a prey to \"Demolisher\" Steele, who wins the race by destroying all Fastex cars.

Stunts, who's desperate to prove that he's no second-stringer to Charger, is disgusted when it appears his pre-race tangle with Grim Repo will keep him sidelined for the unplanned event.

It looks like instead of going to the bank, Team Fastex is going to get taken to the cleaners.

When a blizzard forces the pilot of the plane to turn back, Reed hijacks the flight, but only manages a crash landing atop a mountain.

When the rest of the team finds out about the chase from Lugnut, they follow Stunts and try to help him defend against Rexcor drivers. After he found the temple, he is confused then captured by the villagers who are believing that Owens is their long-waited king, King Tehualpa. For him and his teammates to be free, Stunts challenges Owens to a duel with their cars as Charger helps him win and declines the treasure. When it has come to decline, the villagers realise that their king must be pure-hearted like Stunts.

The series ran from 1999 to 2001 on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]]'s [[Fox Kids]] block.<ref name=Perlmutter>{{cite book |last1=Perlmutter |first1=David |title=The Encyclopedia of American Animated Television Shows |date=2018 |publisher=Rowman & Littlefield |isbn=978-1538103739 |pages=422-423}}</ref>\n\n== Background ==\n26 half-hour episodes were produced by [[Saban Entertainment]], in conjunction with the [[Vancouver]]-based [[Ocean Productions]] voice cast, who had worked with Saban on other projects \u2014 such as ''[[Spider-Man (1994 TV series)|Spider-Man The Animated Series]]'' and ''[[Dragon Ball Z]]''. The show's theme song was composed and performed by Jeremy Sweet. Before beginning its proper run in 2000, ''NASCAR Racers'' premiered as a special three-part TV movie on November 11, 1999, although subsequent re-airings have the first three episodes separated from each other. It ended in 2001, with reruns airing on [[Disney]]'s [[Jetix]] after the company's purchase of the Saban Entertainment library. The show was produced before [[NASCAR on Fox|Fox showed NASCAR races]], and the show's broadcast history only overlapped with the network's coverage of the real series for one month.\n\n== Media ==\n=== Video game ===\nA video game called '''''NASCAR Racers''''' was published in 2000 for [[Microsoft Windows]] and [[Game Boy Color]] by Hasbro and developed by Software Creations (PC) and Digital Eclipse (GBC). A [[PlayStation]] version was planned but cancelled before release.\n\n=== Books ===\n''NASCAR Racers'' books were authored by Gene Hult under the name J. E. Bright, and published by HarperEntertainment.\n\n==Premise==\nWhile real life NASCAR tracks are mainly ovals, ''NASCAR Racers'' is anything but. The racers compete on a wide variety of courses, including road course, off-road, mountain, and Motorsphere. The Motorsphere track starts with a typical race track leading into a sphere, then tracks are wrapped around the inner surface of the sphere.\n\nThe NASCAR Unlimited Division features cutting edge, over-the-top technologies (from the show's point of view). To protect drivers from crashes, each race car has an inner Rescue Racer that ejects from the outer body if an accident happens. XPT racers, introduced in season 2, are the new race cars for Team Fastex. XPT racers use atomic fuel run by forced-combustion systems. Nitro Racers contain high-flux fusion units that can get maximum power out of atomic fuel.\n\nThe change in body design from the XPT racers to the Nitro Racers was similar to the Sprint Cup transition to the \"car of tomorrow\". XPT racers were sleeker than the boxy Nitro Racers.\n\nThe characters often race on simulators to hone their skills before actual races; this is also done by real NASCAR drivers.\n===Team Fastex===\n; Mark \"Charger\" McCutchen ([[Ian James Corlett]]) (4 Wins):Mark is the grandson of Mack McCutchen and son of Mack McCutchen, Jr., two former NASCAR stars and a naturally skilled driver in his own right. Mark wants more than anything to live up to his family's racing legacy and manages to win the championship for Team Fastex in season 1 after a heated race against Kent Steel. He was Lyle Owens' main rival even before the Unlimited Division started and also has a crush on Megan Fassler. He drives car #204.\n\n; Megan \"Spitfire\" Fassler ([[Kathleen Barr]]) (3 Wins): Megan is the daughter of Jack Fassler, owner of Team Fastex, and the only female member of the team. At first her father disapproves about letting her race for the team, but he changes his mind early in the series. In season 2, Garner Rexton hires a woman to pose as Megan's real mother to confuse Megan about her past. Afterwards, Megan forms a team called the Spitfire Racers with Eve \"Wild Card\" Kilder, \"Chrome\" and Zorina. Eventually, she finds out about her true past and rejoins Fastex. She drives car #101.\n\n; Carlos \"Stunts\" Rey ([[Rino Romano]]) (4 Wins): A former champion motorcycle racer, Carlos joined NASCAR to win money to pay for research for his ill father's ongoing medical treatments. Although he takes on several side projects such as a daredevil stunt driving and numerous commercial endorsements, his strong sense of loyalty keeps him with Team Fastex, even after losing most of his savings to a con man and being pressured by Garner Rexton to betray his teammates. He drives car #404.\n\n; Steve \"Flyer\" Sharp ([[Roger Cross|Roger R. Cross]]) (2 Wins):Steve was a fighter pilot in the [[United States Air Force|U.S. Air Force]] years ago, but had to retire when he was exposed to a gaseous cloud of chemical nerve agent during a mission. He survived, but the nerve gas left him prone to sudden attacks of extreme nervousness, shaking and sweating. Steve joined NASCAR to prove to himself that he can still handle a high-pressure situation, but he knows that he is always at risk of an attack. He drives car #808.\n\n; Jack Fassler ([[Richard Newman (actor)|Richard Newman]]): Owner of Team Fastex, husband of Libby Fassler and adoptive father of Megan Fassler. A key founder of the NASCAR Unlimited division, Jack used most of his savings and a large bank loan to launch the races, but the bank from which he borrowed the money was bought out by his business rival Garner Rexton shortly after, effectively putting Jack in direct debt to Rexton and making beating his rival essential to pay back his debts. When he chose the team members for the first season, Jack disapproved of two things: letting Lyle Owens become a member of Team Fastex and letting Megan race for the team. He soon changes his mind about Megan since a four-driver team is needed to compete for the team championship.\n\n; Douglas \"Duck\" Dunaka The Team Fastex ([[Dale Wilson (actor)|Dale Wilson]]):Duck is the crew chief of the team and a master mechanic, although he had previously been a driver much earlier in his career. His past experience compels him to drive one race for Team Fastex as \"Rubber Ducky\" (Car #859) in the season 2 episode \"Duck Unlimited\" after Megan briefly leaves the team. Duck is very fond of greasy comfort food and has a knack for using his favorite tool, duct tape, to fix just about anything. He also has a daughter, Shelby, who hangs around the garage with Miles on occasion.\n\n; Lugnut: Team Fastex mechanic who gets hired instantly by Jack and Duck at the start of the second season when he wanders into the garage and fixes a problem with Stunts' car in mere seconds which Duck was completely stumped on. He later fixes a suspension problem on Stunts' car during a pit stop, which prompts Jack and Duck to offer him a raise. Later in the season, he serves as Crew Chief during the race Duck competes in and forms a friendship with Miles. Although very skilled as a mechanic, he is also very clumsy and has a tendency to trip and launch items that usually land on Duck.\n\n===Team Rexcor===\n; Lyle \"The Collector\" Owens ([[Scott McNeil]]) (2 Wins):A ruthless, cruel and arrogant driver considered a [[threat]] to every NASCAR team. With his deadly driving skills, he has been known to cause crashes from which he likes to collect a piece of the car afterward as a trophy, from which he got the nickname \"The Collector\". Lyle is \"Charger\" McCutchen's number one rival from even when they were both candidates to join Team Fastex, which factored into Garner Rexton later hiring him for Team Rexcor. Lyle is fired from Rexcor at the end of season 1, but is re-hired early in season 2 after he suffers a mutation due to contact with [[toxic waste]], making him larger, stronger and more aggressive than any human being while giving him a hideously scarred face. He drives car #606.\n\n; Hondo \"Specter\" Hines (1 Win):Hondo is one of the spookiest drivers in NASCAR. While very little is known of his past, he has super driving skills, is an expert bully, and is not above cheating to win races. Hondo specializes in sneaking up behind a rival car and wrecking it before his opponent even knows that he's there, just like a ghost, but he'll often team up with his Rexcor teammates to wreck an opponent and slip ahead of the pack. When not driving, he can usually be seen wearing dark [[sunglasses]], even indoors. He drives car #303.\n\n; Zorina (1 Win): A former model and body builder, Zorina is a very arrogant, and aggressive driver that will push anyone, even her own teammates, aside to clear her way to the front of the pack. Described by fellow drivers as \"no lady\", she is never intimidated by anyone, especially male competitors who might see her as a push-over. In season 2, Garner Rexton fires her and replaces her with Tanker, forcing Zorina to ask Megan Fassler for a job driving with the Spitfire Racers, to which Megan wholeheartedly agrees. She drives car #505.\n\n; Diesel \"Junker\" Spitz:Diesel is a former driver for a [[Contract killing|hitmen]] gang in Europe that stole and resold expensive [[Vehicle|vehicles]] on the [[black market]]. He was discovered overseas sabotaging rival race cars by Garner Rexton, who quickly recruited him to drive for Team Rexcor. Diesel is a very skilled driver, but he seems to take more enjoyment in wrecking other cars than actually competing to win races, which gave him the nickname \"Junker\". Diesel speaks in a broken English-German dialect and his voice resembles that of actor and politician [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]]. He drives car #707.\n\n; Garner Rexton ([[Ron Halder]]):The [[Leadership|leader]] of Team Rexcor and usually the mastermind of anything that causes damages and disaster in the NASCAR Unlimited series, as well as the main antagonist of the show. He is a very arrogant, vengeful, manipulative, sadistic, and bloodthirsty person, using his wealth and powerful influence to control others around him and force them to do his dirty work. Many years ago, Garner was deeply in love with Jack Fassler's wife, Libby, but was left heartbroken when she rejected him and went on to marry his rival. Since then, Garner's only motivation in life has been the systematic destruction of Jack Fassler and his racing empire, and he will stop at nothing to achieve his revenge. He confirmed in one episode that he was the one who introduced Libby to Jack, for which Jack stated he'll always owe Garner for. In addition to racing, Garner is also shown to be heavily involved in the production and overseas trafficking of illegal chemical weapons like the one \"Flyer\" was exposed to. Garner was ultimately banned from NASCAR for repeat offences involving race tampering after one person, \"Stunts\", finally had the nerve to stand up to him.\n\n; Spex ([[Richard Newman (actor)|Richard Newman]]):Team Rexcor crew chief and Garner Rexton's right-hand man. Spex is a [[cyborg]] who uses his special body tools to repair any damage to the cars. He also has a monitor screen built into his chest to provide others with face-to-face communication with Garner Rexton. He has a very cold and unfeeling nature and never hesitates to cheat in anyway, which is reflective of his programming to always be loyal to Garner Rexton's cause.\n\n; Kent \"Demolisher\" Steel (1 Win):Kent is an [[Android (robot)|android]] designed for the destruction of Team Fastex. He first appears at the end of season 1 as a very reckless, powerful and destructive driver resembling a human. Being an android, however, he has no fear of death or any other human limitations, allowing him to achieve things on a race track no human driver could. He was ultimately unmasked when \"Charger\" McCutchen and Lyle Owens (who was driving under an alter-ego) reluctantly teamed up to pass him and caused him to crash, revealing his robotic exo-skeleton and leading to Team Rexcor's season disqualification for cheating. He later appears in episodes \"Chain Reaction\" as he tries to sabotage the fuel for the other teams, and \"Rumble\" as one of the drivers used in the free-for-all race. He drove car #500.\n\n===Other Team Rexcor===\n; \"Redline\" O'Rourke (1 Win) ([[Kirby Morrow]]):This driver is a mystery to many people in the NASCAR Unlimited series. His first name is unknown. No one knows how he got to be so good, but he can apparently use his extraordinary driving skills to get past any car he wants, making him a strong adversary and the number-two rival to \"Charger\" McCutchen. While he appears confident and a bit cocky, he always races fairly and honorably. However, he dislikes to lose and even refuses to celebrate a third-place finish with the Spitfire Racers. Like \"Charger\", he has a crush on Megan Fassler. He drives car #119.\n\n; Phil \"Octane\" Knox:Known for the speed and power of his car, Phil appears as a friendly and good-natured rival to Team Fastex, but he secretly works for Rexcor. After \"Flyer\" saves his life after a mishap on a qualifying run, he and \"Flyer\" become good friends, but Phil later poisons \"Flyer\" with a powerful hallucinogenic drug, leading to a series of very dangerous on-track incidents where Flyer thought that he was back in his fighter jet. Later Phil tries to poison \"Flyer\" again just before the final race, but accidentally poisons himself instead, making him think that he was about to go over a waterfall. He drives car #420.\n\n; Tanker:His real name is unknown. Years ago, he was in the army and a very skilled tank operator. Just like how \"Flyer's\" car is modeled like a fighter jet, \"Tanker's\" car resembles a tank, which he uses to batter and bang up all the other cars in his way. The rocket booster on the top of his car also doubles as a [[cannon]], which he never hesitates to use on opponents. Noting his aggressive driving style and growing rivalry with \"Flyer\", Garner Rexton decides to add \"Tanker\" to Team Rexcor near the end of season 2, where he replaces Zorina. He drives car #817.\n\n; Grim Repo: A very tall and silent racer whose true name is unknown. He first appears at the beginning of season 2 together with the four other new racers (\"Redline\", \"Tanker\", \"Chrome\" and \"Octane\") and is rarely seen outside his car afterward. He is never shown without his skull-like helmet, so his real face is never seen and he also usually wears a cloak or cape, even when driving. He once races for Team Rexcor, in the episode \"Rumble\", and seems to form a rivalry with \"Stunts\", who likes to poke fun at his nickname. He drives car #860.\n\n; Chrome: She is the only female member of the new drivers from season 2 and uses her shiny chrome-plated car as an effective weapon in distracting other drivers in order to slip ahead of them on the race course. While very little is known of her past, her cool and confident attitude often intimidates her opponents. Late in Season 2, she joins Megan Fassler's Spitfire Racers team. She drives car #232. \n\n; Eve \"Wild Card\" Kilder:A professional stunt driver whom Garner Rexton used to lure Carlos \"Stunts\" Rey away from Team Fastex. She is arrested in season 1 for trying to kill Team Fastex with some rogue [[fireworks]] during a team stunt at the raceway. While in prison, Lyle Owens negotiates the loan of the car she used so he can compete undercover in the final race of season 1 using the nickname \"Wild Card\". She is later released in season 2, takes back the car and assumes the \"Wild Card\" nickname herself in order to join Megan Fassler's team. She is in love with Carlos \"Stunts\" Rey, but he does not return her affections after the fireworks incident. She drives car #413.\n\n===Other Team Fastex===\n; Libby Fassler: Wife of Jack Fassler and adoptive mother of Megan Fassler. A scientist who works to protect the world's rain forests, she spends a lot of time away from the racing community. In one episode, she is kidnapped by bounty hunters secretly hired by Garner Rexton, who proceeds to send his race team to try and save Libby so he can win her back to his side. However, this plan is undone by Team Fastex. Garner Rexton's love for Libby is his biggest motivation for revenge on Jack, but Libby and Jack both appear to be unaware of his feelings.\n\n; Miles McCutchen ([[Andrew Francis]]):Younger brother of Mark McCutchen who aspires to race like his older sibling. He often can be seen helping Duck and Lugnut in the pits with odd jobs, but occasionally proves himself an even more valuable asset to the team, such as when he discovered Kent Steel's secret of being an android. He is also good friends with Duck's daughter, Shelby.\n\n; Farrell Longstreet: A former racing colleague of \"Charger\" McCutchen's father who comes out of retirement to race in the Unlimited Series in season 2, driving car #993. He appears to suffer a severe injury in a crash \"Charger\" accidentally caused and is forced to retire again, but the injuries were actually a ploy by Garner Rexton to get \"Charger\" to feel upset and throw him off his game. After being reminded of his friendship with Mack McCutchen Jr., Longstreet betrays Rexton by driving \"Charger's\" car as a relief driver in the final race of the season, keeping Team Fastex in contention.\n\n===Commentator===\n; Mike Hauger: A television presenter for Sports Network Interglobal Television (SNIT), alongside Pat Anther, who covers and commentates the NASCAR Unlimited Series races.\n\n; Pat Anther: A television presenter for Sports Network Interglobal Television (SNIT), alongside Mike Hauger, who covers and commentates the NASCAR Unlimited Series races.\n\n==Episodes==\n===Season 1 (1999\u20132000)===\n{{Episode table |background=#226621|overall=6|title=30|writer=19|airdate=20|prodcode=8|episodes=\n\n{{Episode list  | LineColor = 226621\n |Title=The Real Thing|\n |WrittenBy=Michael Edens\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|1999|11|20}}\n |ProdCode=101\n |EpisodeNumber=1\n |ShortSummary= There is a new [[NASCAR]] series called the Unlimited Series, and team Fastex owner Jack Fassler has hired four racers: Mark \"Charger\" McCutchen, Steve \"Flyer\" Sharp, Carlos \"Stunts\" Rey and Lyle \"Collector\" Owens.

With the individual driving championship at stake, the Fastex drivers, each with an individual compulsion to win, no longer race as a team. Disunited, they fall easily as a prey to \"Demolisher\" Steele, who wins the race by destroying all Fastex cars.

It looks like instead of going to the bank, Team Fastex is going to get taken to the cleaners.

When the rest of the team finds out about the chase from Lugnut, they follow Stunts and try to help him defend against Rexcor drivers. After he found the temple, he is confused then captured by the villagers who are believing that Owens is their long-waited king, King Tehualpa. For him and his teammates to be free, Stunts challenges Owens to a duel with their cars as Charger helps him win and declines the treasure.
