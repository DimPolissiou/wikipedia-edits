He governed Libya as Revolutionary Chairman of the [[Libyan Arab Republic]] from 1969 to 1977, and then as the \"[[Brotherly Leader and Guide of the Revolution|Brother Leader]]\" of the [[Libyan Arab Jamahiriya|Great Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya]] from 1977 to 2011. He was initially ideologically committed to [[Arab nationalism]] and [[Arab socialism]] but later ruled according to his own [[Third International Theory]].\n\n<!--Early life and the republic--> \nBorn near [[Sirte]], [[Italian Libya]], to a poor [[Bedouin]] family, Gaddafi became an Arab nationalist while at school in [[Sabha, Libya|Sabha]], later enrolling in the [[Benghazi Military University Academy|Royal Military Academy, Benghazi]]. Within the military, he founded a revolutionary group which deposed the [[Western world|Western]]-backed [[Senussi]] monarchy of [[Idris of Libya|Idris]] in a [[1969 Libyan coup d'\u00e9tat|1969 coup]]. Having taken power, Gaddafi converted Libya into a republic governed by his [[Libyan Revolutionary Command Council|Revolutionary Command Council]]. [[Rule by decree|Ruling by decree]], he deported Libya's [[Italian settlers in Libya|Italian]] and [[History of the Jews in Libya|Jewish]] populations and ejected its Western military bases. Strengthening ties to Arab nationalist governments\u2014particularly [[Gamal Abdel Nasser|Gamal Abdel Nasser's]] Egypt\u2014he unsuccessfully advocated [[pan-Arabism|pan-Arab political union]]. An [[Islamic Modernism|Islamic modernist]], he introduced ''[[sharia]]'' as the basis for the legal system and promoted \"[[Islamic socialism]]\". He nationalized the oil industry and used the increasing state revenues to bolster the military, fund foreign revolutionaries, and implement social programs emphasizing house-building, healthcare and education projects. In 1973, he initiated a \"[[People's Revolution (Libya)|Popular Revolution]]\" with the formation of [[Basic People's Congress (political)|Basic People's Congresses]], presented as a system of [[direct democracy]], but retained personal control over major decisions. He outlined his Third International Theory that year, publishing these ideas in ''[[The Green Book (Muammar Gaddafi)|The Green Book]]''.\n\n<!--Jamahiriya and downfall-->\nGaddafi transformed Libya into a new [[socialist state]] called a ''[[Jamahiriya]]'' (\"state of the masses\") in 1977. He officially adopted a symbolic role in governance but remained head of both the military and the Revolutionary Committees responsible for policing and suppressing dissent. During the 1970s and 1980s, Libya's unsuccessful border conflicts with [[Libyan\u2013Egyptian War|Egypt]] and [[Chadian\u2013Libyan conflict|Chad]], support for foreign militants, and alleged responsibility for the [[Pan Am Flight 103|Lockerbie bombing]] in Scotland left it increasingly isolated on the world stage. A particularly hostile relationship developed with the United States, United Kingdom, and Israel, resulting in the [[1986 United States bombing of Libya|1986 US bombing of Libya]] and [[United Nations]]\u2013imposed [[economic sanctions]]. From 1999, Gaddafi shunned Arab socialism and encouraged economic [[privatization]], rapprochement with [[Western world|Western nations]], and [[pan-Africanism]]; he was [[Chairperson of the African Union|Chairperson]] of the [[African Union]] from 2009 to 2010. Amid the 2011 [[Arab Spring]], protests against widespread corruption and unemployment broke out in eastern Libya. The situation descended into [[Libyan Civil War (2011)|civil war]], in which [[NATO]] [[2011 military intervention in Libya|intervened militarily]] on the side of the anti-Gaddafist [[National Transitional Council]] (NTC). The government was overthrown, and Gaddafi retreated to Sirte, only to be [[Death of Muammar Gaddafi|captured and killed]] by NTC militants.\n\n<!--Legacy and assessment:-->\nA highly divisive figure, Gaddafi dominated Libya's politics for four decades and was the subject of a pervasive [[cult of personality]]. He was decorated with various awards and praised for his [[anti-imperialist]] stance, support for Arab\u2014and then African\u2014unity, and for significant improvements that his government brought to the Libyan people's quality of life. Conversely, many Libyans strongly opposed his social and economic reforms, and he was posthumously accused of sexual abuse. He was condemned by many as a [[dictator]] whose authoritarian administration violated [[Human rights in Libya|human rights]] and financed global [[terrorism]].\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Early life==\n\n===Childhood: to 1950===\nMuammar Mohammed Abu Minyar Gaddafi<ref name=\"iccwarrant\">{{cite web |title=The Prosecutor v.

He governed Libya as Revolutionary Chairman of the [[Libyan Arab Republic]] from 1969 to 1977, and then as the \"[[Brotherly Leader and Guide of the Revolution|Brother Leader]]\" of the [[Libyan Arab Jamahiriya|Great Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya]] from 1977 to 2011. He was initially ideologically committed to [[Arab nationalism]] and [[Arab socialism]] but later ruled according to his own [[Third International Theory]].\n\n<!--Early life and the republic--> \nBorn near [[Sirte]], [[Italian Libya]], to a poor [[Bedouin]] family, Gaddafi became an Arab nationalist while at school in [[Sabha, Libya|Sabha]], later enrolling in the [[Benghazi Military University Academy|Royal Military Academy, Benghazi]]. Within the military, he founded a revolutionary group which deposed the [[Western world|Western]]-backed [[Senussi]] monarchy of [[Idris of Libya|Idris]] in a [[1969 Libyan coup d'\u00e9tat|1969 coup]]. Having taken power, Gaddafi converted Libya into a republic governed by his [[Libyan Revolutionary Command Council|Revolutionary Command Council]]. [[Rule by decree|Ruling by decree]], he deported Libya's [[Italian settlers in Libya|Italian]] and [[History of the Jews in Libya|Jewish]] populations and ejected its Western military bases. Strengthening ties to Arab nationalist governments\u2014particularly [[Gamal Abdel Nasser|Gamal Abdel Nasser's]] Egypt\u2014he unsuccessfully advocated [[pan-Arabism|pan-Arab political union]]. An [[Islamic Modernism|Islamic modernist]], he introduced ''[[sharia]]'' as the basis for the legal system and promoted \"[[Islamic socialism]]\". He nationalized the oil industry and used the increasing state revenues to bolster the military, fund foreign revolutionaries, and implement social programs emphasizing house-building, healthcare and education projects. In 1973, he initiated a \"[[People's Revolution (Libya)|Popular Revolution]]\" with the formation of [[Basic People's Congress (political)|Basic People's Congresses]], presented as a system of [[direct democracy]], but retained personal control over major decisions. He outlined his Third International Theory that year, publishing these ideas in ''[[The Green Book (Muammar Gaddafi)|The Green Book]]''.\n\n<!--Jamahiriya and downfall-->\nGaddafi transformed Libya into a new [[socialist state]] called a ''[[Jamahiriya]]'' (\"state of the masses\") in 1977. He officially adopted a symbolic role in governance but remained head of both the military and the Revolutionary Committees responsible for policing and suppressing dissent. During the 1970s and 1980s, Libya's unsuccessful border conflicts with [[Libyan\u2013Egyptian War|Egypt]] and [[Chadian\u2013Libyan conflict|Chad]], support for foreign militants, and alleged responsibility for the [[Pan Am Flight 103|Lockerbie bombing]] in Scotland left it increasingly isolated on the world stage. A particularly hostile relationship developed with the United States, United Kingdom, and Israel, resulting in the [[1986 United States bombing of Libya|1986 US bombing of Libya]] and [[United Nations]]\u2013imposed [[economic sanctions]]. From 1999, Gaddafi shunned Arab socialism and encouraged economic [[privatization]], rapprochement with [[Western world|Western nations]], and [[pan-Africanism]]; he was [[Chairperson of the African Union|Chairperson]] of the [[African Union]] from 2009 to 2010. Amid the 2011 [[Arab Spring]], protests against widespread corruption and unemployment broke out in eastern Libya. The situation descended into [[Libyan Civil War (2011)|civil war]], in which [[NATO]] [[2011 military intervention in Libya|intervened militarily]] on the side of the anti-Gaddafist [[National Transitional Council]] (NTC). The government was overthrown, and Gaddafi retreated to Sirte, only to be [[Death of Muammar Gaddafi|captured and killed]] by NTC militants.\n\n<!--Legacy and assessment:-->\nA highly divisive figure, Gaddafi dominated Libya's politics for four decades and was the subject of a pervasive [[cult of personality]]. He was decorated with various awards and praised for his [[anti-imperialist]] stance, support for Arab\u2014and then African\u2014unity, and for significant improvements that his government brought to the Libyan people's quality of life. Conversely, many Libyans strongly opposed his social and economic reforms, and he was posthumously accused of sexual abuse.
