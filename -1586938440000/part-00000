It is the first official [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] to the ''[[Five Nights at Freddy's]]'' series. The game was released for [[Microsoft Windows]] on January 21, 2016, but came with unfinished gameplay and a large amount of bugs, leading to bad reception and ultimately the decision for the game's takedown from digital storefronts. On February 8, 2016, the game was updated, and re-released as [[freeware]] on [[Game Jolt]] free of charge.\ne\n== Gameplay ==\nThe player has two modes to play in: Adventure and  Party. The game also has three  difficulty levels to choose from, Easy Normal and Hard. The player starts by choosing two parties consisting of four characters each. The starter characters, the original and toy versions of the first [[Five Nights at Freddy's (series)|main games]] characters, can all be swapped in and out of the party. As the player continues, they collect more characters to place in their party, with there being 40 characters available in total from across the first four games. Along the way, a character known as Fredbear will give the player tips on what to do next. These tips frequently [[break the fourth wall]] due to Fredbear's seeming awareness of the situation he is placed in.\n\nThe gameplay consists of exploring through the game world and accessing new areas.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|url=http://www.oneangrygamer.net/2016/01/five-nights-at-freddys-world-complete-gameplay-walkthrough/1452/|title=Five Nights At Freddy\u2019s World Complete Gameplay Walkthrough|date=January 23, 2016|work=One Angry Gamer|access-date=May 10, 2017|language=en-US}}</ref> Once new areas are revealed and a special button is pressed in them, the player can use \"jumping\" to teleport between each area through an overworld map. Initially, the world was depicted in a 2D 8-bit style, but as of Version 1.2 released in May 2016, the world has been redesigned into that of a fully animated 3D style (it is technically 2D art). Many enemy characters can be found throughout the game, each exclusive to their own area, which can be battled with. Upon defeating an enemy, the player will gain experience points and \"Faz Tokens\", which are used to buy upgrades such as chips and bytes to aid the player during the game.\n\nMeanwhile, the battles against enemies, which are [[Random ener|completely random]] (with the exception of [[Boss (video gaming)|boss battles]]), are conducted in a separate 3D styled (again still technically 2d) playing field. In battles, the player characters are on the right-hand side, while the enemies are on the left-hand side. Each character has a [[Hit points|HP]] meter located at the top right corner; by sustaining damages, the meter decreases until it reaches zero, which induces a [[Knock out|KO]] (represented by a gravestone replacing the knocked out character) unless the player selects a resurrection command available on select characters. For each turn, the player is given choices for each character and must choose one of their three commands, which differ depending on the characters. The commands have different color tags and have different impacts, including healing the team (pink), providing status buffs (white), single-target attacks (orange), area attacks (red), poisonous attacks (green), and possible instant-kill attacks (black), among others. Once a turn is used, the player has to wait for some time until the next turn begins. The player can also swap the current party with the reserve at any time. After each battle, all characters, including the knocked out ones, are restored to full health.\n\nThe GameJolt version changed the world graphics from 2D to 3D. As of Version 1.2, the player is able to travel to a new land, to play the minigames of characters whose codes are being recycled for other games to unlock new characters after the player completes the sets of [[minigame]]s in a range of modes. These include \"Foxy Fighters\", \"Chica's Magic Rainbow\", \"Foxy.EXE\" and \"FNAF 57: Freddy in Space\". \n\n=== Setting ===\n''FNaF World'' takes place in a world inhabited by enemies and FNAF characters, who live in different biomes, that include a snowy plain, deep forests, graveyard, lake, carnival, and caves. There also exists an inner dimension known as the \"Flipside\", the world's game code, in which there are several glitches that enable travel to otherwise unreachable places.<ref name=\":0\" /> The Flipside has four layers in total, although going beyond the third level is a [[point of no return]], leading to Old Man Consequences. He tells you to \"Rest your own soul. Leave the demons to his demons.\"  It is speculated that \"he\" is William Afton, and he is suffering in hell, considering that you can hear his screams of torment in the background.\n\n== Development ==\n''FNaF World'' was first announced on September 15, 2015, in a Steam post by Cawthon.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://steamcommunity.com/gid/103582791439004273/announcements/detail/124202807772796833|title=Steam Community :: Group Announcements :: Five Nights at Freddy's 4|website=steamcommunity.com|language=en|access-date=March 19, 2017|date=September 15, 2015}}</ref> Later, a trailer was uploaded to [[YouTube]], depicting the characters of the four previous games as cute.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://kotaku.com/five-nights-at-freddy-s-creator-is-making-an-rpg-1730892115 | title = Five Nights At Freddy's Creator Is Making An RPG | last = Klepek | first = Patrick | date = September 16, 2015 | website = [[Kotaku]] | publisher = [[Gawker Media]] | accessdate = September 16, 2015}}</ref> The announcement was considered to be a hoax due to similar [[Public relations|PR]] actions taken by Cawthon, however, it was not disproven until its release.
