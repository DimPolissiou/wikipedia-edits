The [[AMD K8]] [[microarchitecture]], in the [[Opteron]] and [[Athlon 64]] processors, was the first to implement it. This was the first significant addition to the [[x86]] architecture designed by a company other than Intel. Intel was forced to follow suit and introduced a modified [[NetBurst (microarchitecture)|NetBurst]] family which was software-compatible with AMD's specification. [[VIA Technologies]] introduced x86-64 in their VIA Isaiah architecture, with the [[VIA Nano]].\n\nThe x86-64 architecture is distinct from the Intel [[Itanium]] architecture (formerly [[IA-64]]), which is not compatible on the native instruction set level with the x86 architecture. Operating systems and applications compiled for one cannot be run on the other.\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n== AMD64 ==\n[[File:AMD64 Logo.svg|thumb|150px|right|AMD64 logo]]\n\n=== History ===\nAMD64 was created as an alternative to the radically different [[IA-64]] architecture, which was designed by Intel and [[Hewlett Packard]].

The designers took the opportunity to make other improvements as well. Some of the most significant changes are described below.\n\n; 64-bit integer capability\n: All [[general-purpose register]]s (GPRs) are expanded from 32&nbsp;[[bit]]s to 64&nbsp;bits, and all arithmetic and logical operations, memory-to-register and register-to-memory operations, etc., can now operate directly on 64-bit integers. [[Stack (data structure)|Pushes and pops]] on the [[Stack register|stack]] default to 8-byte strides, and [[pointer (computer programming)|pointers]] are 8 bytes wide.\n; Additional registers\n: In addition to increasing the size of the general-purpose registers, the number of named general-purpose registers is increased from eight (i.e. eax, ecx, edx, ebx, esp, ebp, esi, edi) in x86 to 16 (i.e. rax, rcx, rdx, rbx, rsp, rbp, rsi, rdi, r8, r9, r10, r11, r12, r13, r14, r15). It is therefore possible to keep more local variables in registers rather than on the stack, and to let registers hold frequently accessed constants; arguments for small and fast subroutines may also be passed in registers to a greater extent.\n\n: AMD64 still has fewer registers than many [[RISC]] [[instruction set]]s (e.g. [[PA-RISC]], [[Power ISA]], and [[MIPS architecture|MIPS]] have 32 GPRs; [[DEC Alpha|Alpha]], [[ARM architecture#64/32-bit architecture|64-bit ARM]], and [[SPARC]] have 31) or [[VLIW]]-like machines such as the [[IA-64]] (which has 128&nbsp;registers). However, an AMD64 implementation may have far more internal registers than the number of architectural registers exposed by the instruction set (see [[register renaming]]). (For example, AMD Zen cores have 168 64-bit integer and 160 128-bit vector floating point physical internal registers.)\n; Additional XMM (SSE) registers\n: Similarly, the number of 128-bit XMM<!-- don't confuse this name with MMX; MMX has no hardware registers and is mapped to the FPU stack. Here we talk about SSE (XMM) registers --> registers (used for [[Streaming SIMD Extensions|Streaming SIMD]] instructions) is also increased from 8 to 16.\n: The traditional x87 FPU register stack is not included in the register file size extension in 64-bit mode, compared with the XMM registers used by SSE2, which did get extended. The [[x87]] register stack is not a simple register file although it does allow direct access to individual registers by low cost exchange operations.\n; Larger virtual address space\n: The AMD64 architecture defines a 64-bit virtual address format, of which the low-order 48 bits are used in current implementations.<ref name=\"amd-24593\"/>{{rp|page=120|date=November 2012}} This allows up to 256&nbsp;[[Tebi|TiB]] (2<sup>48</sup> [[byte]]s) of virtual address space.

Any implementation, therefore, allows the same physical address limit as under [[long mode]].<ref name=\"amd-24593\" />{{rp|page=24|date=November 2012}}\n; Instruction pointer relative data access\n: Instructions can now reference data relative to the instruction pointer (RIP register). This makes [[position independent code]], as is often used in [[Library (computing)#Shared libraries|shared libraries]] and code loaded at run time, more efficient.\n; SSE instructions\n: The original AMD64 architecture adopted Intel's [[Streaming SIMD Extensions|SSE]] and [[SSE2]] as core instructions. These instruction sets provide a vector supplement to the scalar [[x87]] FPU, for the single-precision and double-precision data types. SSE2 also offers integer vector operations, for data types ranging from 8bit to 64bit precision. This makes the vector capabilities of the architecture on par with those of the most advanced x86 processors of its time. These instructions can also be used in 32-bit mode. The proliferation of 64-bit processors has made these vector capabilities ubiquitous in home computers, allowing the improvement of the standards of 32-bit applications. The 32-bit edition of Windows 8, for example, requires the presence of SSE2 instructions.<ref>{{cite web|last=Microsoft Corporation|title=What is PAE, NX, and SSE2 and why does my PC need to support them to run Windows 8 ?|url=http://windows.microsoft.com/en-GB/windows-8/what-is-pae-nx-sse2|accessdate=March 19, 2013}}</ref> [[SSE3]] instructions and later [[Streaming SIMD Extensions]] instruction sets are not standard features of the architecture.\n; No-Execute bit\n: The No-Execute bit or [[NX bit]] (bit 63 of the page table entry) allows the operating system to specify which pages of virtual address space can contain executable code and which cannot. An attempt to execute code from a page tagged \"no execute\" will result in a memory access violation, similar to an attempt to write to a read-only page. This should make it more difficult for malicious code to take control of the system via \"[[Buffer overflow|buffer overrun]]\" or \"unchecked buffer\" attacks. A similar feature has been available on x86 processors since the [[80286]] as an attribute of [[segment descriptor]]s; however, this works only on an entire segment at a time.\n\n: [[x86 memory segmentation|Segmented addressing]] has long been considered an obsolete mode of operation, and all current PC operating systems in effect bypass it, setting all segments to a base address of zero and (in their 32-bit implementation) a size of 4&nbsp; GB. AMD was the first x86-family vendor to implement no-execute in linear addressing mode. The feature is also available in legacy mode on AMD64 processors, and recent Intel x86 processors, when PAE is used.\n; Removal of older features\n: A few \"system programming\" features of the x86 architecture were either unused or underused in modern operating systems and are either not available on AMD64 in long (64-bit and compatibility) mode, or exist only in limited form. These include segmented addressing (although the FS and GS segments are retained in vestigial form for use as extra-base pointers to operating system structures),<ref name=\"amd-24593\"/>{{rp|page=70|date=November 2012}} the [[Task State Segment|task state switch]] mechanism, and [[virtual 8086 mode]]. These features remain fully implemented in \"legacy mode\", allowing these processors to run 32-bit and 16-bit operating systems without modifications. Some instructions that proved to be rarely useful are not supported in 64-bit mode, including saving/restoring of segment registers on the stack, saving/restoring of all registers (PUSHA/POPA), decimal arithmetic, BOUND and INTO instructions, and \"far\" jumps and calls with immediate operands.\n\n\n=== {{Anchor|VIRTUAL-ADDRESS-SPACE}}Virtual address space details ===\n\n==== Canonical form addresses ====\n{{Multiple image\n | header    = Canonical address space implementations (diagrams not to scale)\n | width     = 150\n | direction = horizontal\n | align     = right\n | image1    = AMD64-canonical--48-bit.svg\n | caption1  = Current 48-bit implementation\n | image2    = AMD64-canonical--56-bit.svg\n | caption2  = 56-bit implementation\n | image3    = AMD64-canonical--64-bit.svg\n | caption3  = 64-bit implementation\n}}\n\nAlthough virtual addresses are 64&nbsp; bits wide in 64-bit mode, current implementations (and all chips that are known to be in the planning stages) do not allow the entire virtual address space of 2<sup>64</sup> bytes (16&nbsp; EiB) to be used.\nThis would be approximately four billion times the size of the virtual address space on 32-bit machines. Most operating systems and applications will not need such a large address space for the foreseeable future, so implementing such wide virtual addresses would simply increase the complexity and cost of address translation with no real benefit. AMD, therefore, decided that, in the first implementations of the architecture, only the least significant 48&nbsp; bits of a virtual address would actually be used in address translation ([[page table]] lookup).<ref name=\"amd-24593\"/>{{rp|page=120|date=November 2012}}\n\nIn addition, the AMD specification requires that the most significant 16 bits of any virtual address,  bits 48 through 63, must be copies of bit 47 (in a manner akin to [[sign extension]]). If this requirement is not met, the processor will raise an exception.<ref name=\"amd-24593\"/>{{rp|page=131|date=November 2012}} Addresses complying with this rule are referred to as \"canonical form.\"<ref name=\"amd-24593\"/>{{rp|page=130|date=November 2012}} Canonical form addresses run from 0 through 00007FFF'FFFFFFFF, and from FFFF8000'00000000 through FFFFFFFF'FFFFFFFF, for a total of 256&nbsp;TB of usable virtual address space. This is still 65,536 times larger than the virtual 4 GB address space of 32-bit machines.\n\nThis feature eases later scalability to true 64-bit addressing. Many operating systems (including, but not limited to, the [[Windows NT]] family) take the higher-addressed half of the address space (named [[kernel space]]) for themselves and leave the lower-addressed half ([[user space]]) for application code, user mode stacks, heaps, and other data regions.<ref name=\"win-lim-msdn\"/> The \"canonical address\" design ensures that every AMD64 compliant implementation has, in effect, two memory halves: the lower half starts at 00000000'00000000 and \"grows upwards\" as more virtual address bits become available, while the higher half is \"docked\" to the top of the address space and grows downwards. Also, enforcing the \"canonical form\" of addresses by checking the unused address bits prevents their use by the operating system in [[tagged pointer]]s as flags, privilege markers, etc., as such use could become problematic when the architecture is extended to implement more virtual address bits.\n\nThe first versions of Windows for x64 did not even use the full 256&nbsp;TB; they were restricted to just 8&nbsp;TB of user space and 8&nbsp;TB of kernel space.<ref name=\"win-lim-msdn\">{{cite web|url=http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa366778(v=vs.85).aspx#memory_limits |title=Memory Limits for Windows Releases |website=[[MSDN]] |publisher=[[Microsoft]] |date=November 16, 2013 |accessdate=January 20, 2014}}</ref> Windows did not support the entire 48-bit address space until [[Windows&nbsp;8.1]], which was released in October 2013.<ref name=\"win-lim-msdn\"/> <!--- it would be good to include other OS's limits here. --->\n\n==== Page table structure ====\nThe 64-bit addressing mode (\"[[long mode]]\") is a superset of [[Physical Address Extension]]s (PAE); because of this, [[paging|page]] sizes may be 4&nbsp;[[Kilobyte|KB]] (2<sup>12</sup> bytes) or 2&nbsp;[[Megabyte|MB]] (2<sup>21</sup> bytes).<ref name=\"amd-24593\"/>{{rp|page=120|date=November 2012}} Long mode also supports page sizes of 1&nbsp;[[Gigabyte|GB]] (2<sup>30</sup> bytes).<ref name=\"amd-24593\"/>{{rp|page=120|date=November 2012}} Rather than the three-level [[page table]] system used by systems in PAE mode, systems running in [[long mode]] use four levels of page table: PAE's ''Page-Directory Pointer Table'' is extended from four entries to 512, and an additional ''Page-Map Level&nbsp;4 (PML4) Table'' is added, containing 512 entries in 48-bit implementations.<ref name=\"amd-24593\"/>{{rp|page=131|date=November 2012}} A full mapping hierarchy of 4&nbsp;KB pages for the whole 48-bit space would take a bit more than 512&nbsp;GB of memory (about 0.195% of the 256&nbsp;TB virtual space).\n\nIntel has implemented a scheme with a [[Intel 5-level paging|5-level page table]], which allows Intel 64 processors to support a 57-bit virtual address space.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://software.intel.com/sites/default/files/managed/2b/80/5-level_paging_white_paper.pdf|title=5-Level Paging and 5-Level EPT|publisher=Intel|date=May 2017|accessdate=June 17, 2017}}</ref> Further extensions may allow full 64-bit virtual address space and physical memory by expanding the page table entry size to 128-bit, and reduce page walks in the 5-level hierarchy by using a larger 64&nbsp;KB page allocation size that still supports 4&nbsp;KB page operations for backward compatibility. <Ref>{{cite patent | country = US | number = 9858198 | status = patent | title =  64KB page system that supports 4KB page operation | pridate = 2015-06-26 | fdate = 2015-06-26 | pubdate = 2016-12-29 | gdate = 2018-01-02 | invent1 = Larry Seiler | assign1 = Intel Corp.}} </ref>\n\n==== Operating system limits ====\nThe operating system can also limit the virtual address space.

It is used by 64-bit operating systems. Under a 64-bit operating system, 64-bit programs run under 64-bit mode, and 32-bit and 16-bit protected mode applications (that do not need to use either real mode or virtual 8086 mode in order to execute at any time) run under compatibility mode. Real-mode programs and programs that use virtual 8086 mode at any time cannot be run in long mode unless those modes are emulated in software.<ref name=\"amd-24593\"/>{{rp|11}} However, such programs may be started from an operating system running in long mode on processors supporting [[VT-x]] or [[AMD-V]] by creating a virtual processor running in the desired mode.\n\nSince the basic [[instruction set]] is the same, there is almost no performance penalty for executing protected mode x86 code. This is unlike Intel's [[IA-64]], where differences in the underlying instruction set mean that running 32-bit code must be done either in emulation of x86 (making the process slower) or with a dedicated x86 coprocessor. However, on the x86-64 platform, many x86 applications could benefit from a 64-bit [[recompile]], due to the additional registers in 64-bit code and guaranteed SSE2-based FPU support, which a [[compiler]] can use for optimization. However, applications that regularly handle integers wider than 32 bits, such as cryptographic algorithms, will need a rewrite of the code handling the huge integers in order to take advantage of the 64-bit registers.\n\n==== Legacy mode ====\nLegacy mode is the mode used by 32-bit or 16-bit \"protected mode\" operating systems.<ref name=\"intel-xed-1\">{{cite web |last1=Charney |first1=Mark |url=https://intelxed.github.io/ref-manual/xed-machine-mode-enum_8h.html |website=Xed |publisher=Intel Corporation |title=Xed Machine Mode Definitions |accessdate=16 June 2019}}</ref> In this mode, the processor acts like an older x86 processor, and only 16-bit and 32-bit code can be executed.

It is backwards compatible with the original [[8086]] and [[8088]] processors. Real mode is primarily used today by operating system bootloaders, which are required by the architecture to configure [[#Physical_address_space_details|virtual memory details]] before transitioning to higher modes.\n\n== Intel 64 ==\n'''Intel&nbsp;64''' is Intel's implementation of x86-64, used and implemented in various processors made by Intel.\n\n=== History ===\nHistorically, AMD has developed and produced processors with instruction sets patterned after Intel's original designs, but with x86-64, roles were reversed: Intel found itself in the position of adopting the [[instruction set architecture|ISA]] which AMD had created as an extension to Intel's own x86 processor line.\n\nIntel's project was originally [[codename]]d ''Yamhill'' (after the [[Yamhill River]] in Oregon's Willamette Valley).{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}} After several years of denying its existence, Intel announced at the February 2004 [[Intel Developer Forum|IDF]] that the project was indeed underway.

In contrast, the initial Prescott chips (February 2004) did not enable this feature. Intel subsequently began selling Intel&nbsp;64-enabled Pentium 4s using the E0 revision of the Prescott core, being sold on the OEM market as the Pentium 4, model F. The E0 revision also adds eXecute Disable (XD) (Intel's name for the [[NX bit]]) to Intel&nbsp;64, and has been included in then current Xeon code-named ''Irwindale''.

It was included as a standard distribution architecture as of 5.2-RELEASE in January 2004. Since then, FreeBSD has designated it as a Tier&nbsp;1 platform. The 6.0-RELEASE version cleaned up some quirks with running x86 executables under amd64, and most drivers work just as they do on the x86 architecture. Work is currently being done to integrate more fully the x86 [[application binary interface]] (ABI), in the same manner as the Linux 32-bit ABI compatibility currently works.\n\n==== NetBSD ====\nx86-64 architecture support was first committed to the [[NetBSD]] source tree on June 19, 2001. As of NetBSD&nbsp;2.0, released on December 9, 2004, ''NetBSD/amd64'' is a fully integrated and supported port.\n32-bit code is still supported in 64-bit mode, with a netbsd-32 kernel compatibility layer for 32-bit syscalls. The NX bit is used to provide non-executable stack and heap with per-page granularity (segment granularity being used on 32-bit x86).\n\n==== OpenBSD ====\n[[OpenBSD]] has supported AMD64 since OpenBSD 3.5, released on May 1, 2004. Complete in-tree implementation of AMD64 support was achieved prior to the hardware's initial release because AMD had loaned several machines for the project's [[hackathon]] that year. OpenBSD developers have taken to the platform because of its support for the [[NX bit]], which allowed for an easy implementation of the [[W^X]] feature.\n\nThe code for the AMD64 port of OpenBSD also runs on Intel 64 processors which contains cloned use of the AMD64 extensions, but since Intel left out the page table NX bit in early Intel 64 processors, there is no W^X capability on those Intel CPUs; later Intel 64 processors added the NX bit under the name \"XD bit\". [[Symmetric multiprocessing]] (SMP) works on OpenBSD's AMD64 port, starting with release 3.6 on November 1, 2004.\n\n=== DOS ===\nIt is possible to enter [[long mode]] under [[DOS]] without a DOS extender,<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.turboirc.com/asm |title=Tutorial for entering protected and long mode from DOS |access-date=July 6, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170222181811/http://www.turboirc.com/asm/ |archive-date=February 22, 2017 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref> but the user must return to real mode in order to call BIOS or DOS interrupts.\n\nIt may also be possible to enter [[long mode]] with a [[DOS extender]] similar to [[DOS/4GW]], but more complex since x86-64 lacks [[virtual 8086 mode]]. DOS itself is not aware of that, and no benefits should be expected unless running DOS in an emulation with an adequate virtualization driver backend, for example: the mass storage interface.\n\n=== Linux ===\n{{See also|Comparison of Linux distributions#Instruction set architecture support}}\n\n[[Linux]] was the first operating system kernel to run the x86-64 architecture in [[long mode]], starting with the 2.4 version in 2001 (preceding the hardware's availability).<ref>{{cite web |title=Porting Linux to x86-64 |author=Andi Kleen |url=http://www.x86-64.org/pipermail/announce/2001-June/000020.html |date=June 26, 2001 |quote=Status: The kernel, compiler, tool chain work.

A 32-bit kernel can also be manually selected, in which case only 32-bit executables will run. The <code>isainfo</code> command can be used to determine if a system is running a 64-bit kernel.\n\nFor Solaris 11, only the 64-bit kernel is provided.

This is also implemented on recent 32-bit versions of Windows when they are started in PAE mode.\n* Instead of FS segment descriptor on x86 versions of the [[Windows NT]] family, GS segment descriptor is used to point to two operating system defined structures: Thread Information Block (NT_TIB) in user mode and Processor Control Region (KPCR) in kernel mode. Thus, for example, in user mode <code>GS:0</code> is the address of the first member of the Thread Information Block. Maintaining this convention made the x86-64 port easier, but required AMD to retain the function of the FS and GS segments in long mode \u2013 even though segmented addressing ''per se'' is not really used by any modern operating system.<ref name=\"Pietrek64BitWindowsProgramming\"/>\n* Early reports claimed that the operating system scheduler would not save and restore the x87 FPU machine state across thread context switches. Observed behavior shows that this is not the case: the x87 state is saved and restored, except for kernel mode-only threads (a limitation that exists in the 32-bit version as well).

This was the first significant addition to the [[x86]] architecture designed by a company other than Intel. Intel was forced to follow suit and introduced a modified [[NetBurst (microarchitecture)|NetBurst]] family which was software-compatible with AMD's specification. [[VIA Technologies]] introduced x86-64 in their VIA Isaiah architecture, with the [[VIA Nano]].\n\nThe x86-64 architecture is distinct from the Intel [[Itanium]] architecture (formerly [[IA-64]]), which is not compatible on the native instruction set level with the x86 architecture.

The designers took the opportunity to make other improvements as well. Some of the most significant changes are described below.\n\n; 64-bit integer capability\n: All [[general-purpose register]]s (GPRs) are expanded from 32&nbsp;[[bit]]s to 64&nbsp;bits, and all arithmetic and logical operations, memory-to-register and register-to-memory operations, etc., can now operate directly on 64-bit integers. [[Stack (data structure)|Pushes and pops]] on the [[Stack register|stack]] default to 8-byte strides, and [[pointer (computer programming)|pointers]] are 8 bytes wide.\n; Additional registers\n: In addition to increasing the size of the general-purpose registers, the number of named general-purpose registers is increased from eight (i.e. eax, ecx, edx, ebx, esp, ebp, esi, edi) in x86 to 16 (i.e. rax, rcx, rdx, rbx, rsp, rbp, rsi, rdi, r8, r9, r10, r11, r12, r13, r14, r15). It is therefore possible to keep more local variables in registers rather than on the stack, and to let registers hold frequently accessed constants; arguments for small and fast subroutines may also be passed in registers to a greater extent.\n\n: AMD64 still has fewer registers than many [[RISC]] [[instruction set]]s (e.g. [[PA-RISC]], [[Power ISA]], and [[MIPS architecture|MIPS]] have 32 GPRs; [[DEC Alpha|Alpha]], [[ARM architecture#64/32-bit architecture|64-bit ARM]], and [[SPARC]] have 31) or [[VLIW]]-like machines such as the [[IA-64]] (which has 128&nbsp;registers). However, an AMD64 implementation may have far more internal registers than the number of architectural registers exposed by the instruction set (see [[register renaming]]). (For example, AMD Zen cores have 168 64-bit integer and 160 128-bit vector floating point physical internal registers.)\n; Additional XMM (SSE) registers\n: Similarly, the number of 128-bit XMM<!-- don't confuse this name with MMX; MMX has no hardware registers and is mapped to the FPU stack. Here we talk about SSE (XMM) registers --> registers (used for [[Streaming SIMD Extensions|Streaming SIMD]] instructions) is also increased from 8 to 16.\n: The traditional x87 FPU register stack is not included in the register file size extension in 64-bit mode, compared with the XMM registers used by SSE2, which did get extended. The [[x87]] register stack is not a simple register file although it does allow direct access to individual registers by low cost exchange operations.\n; Larger virtual address space\n: The AMD64 architecture defines a 64-bit virtual address format, of which the low-order 48 bits are used in current implementations.<ref name=\"amd-24593\"/>{{rp|page=120|date=November 2012}} This allows up to 256&nbsp;[[Terabyte|TB]] (2<sup>48</sup> [[byte]]s) of virtual address space.

Any implementation, therefore, allows the same physical address limit as under [[long mode]].<ref name=\"amd-24593\"/>{{rp|page=24|date=November 2012}}\n; Instruction pointer relative data access\n: Instructions can now reference data relative to the instruction pointer (RIP register). This makes [[position independent code]], as is often used in [[Library (computing)#Shared libraries|shared libraries]] and code loaded at run time, more efficient.\n; SSE instructions\n: The original AMD64 architecture adopted Intel's [[Streaming SIMD Extensions|SSE]] and [[SSE2]] as core instructions. These instruction sets provide a vector supplement to the scalar [[x87]] FPU, for the single-precision and double-precision data types. SSE2 also offers integer vector operations, for data types ranging from 8bit to 64bit precision. This makes the vector capabilities of the architecture on par with those of the most advanced x86 processors of its time. These instructions can also be used in 32-bit mode. The proliferation of 64-bit processors has made these vector capabilities ubiquitous in home computers, allowing the improvement of the standards of 32-bit applications. The 32-bit edition of Windows 8, for example, requires the presence of SSE2 instructions.<ref>{{cite web|last=Microsoft Corporation|title=What is PAE, NX, and SSE2 and why does my PC need to support them to run Windows 8 ?|url=http://windows.microsoft.com/en-GB/windows-8/what-is-pae-nx-sse2|accessdate=March 19, 2013}}</ref> [[SSE3]] instructions and later [[Streaming SIMD Extensions]] instruction sets are not standard features of the architecture.\n; No-Execute bit\n: The No-Execute bit or [[NX bit]] (bit 63 of the page table entry) allows the operating system to specify which pages of virtual address space can contain executable code and which cannot. An attempt to execute code from a page tagged \"no execute\" will result in a memory access violation, similar to an attempt to write to a read-only page. This should make it more difficult for malicious code to take control of the system via \"[[Buffer overflow|buffer overrun]]\" or \"unchecked buffer\" attacks. A similar feature has been available on x86 processors since the [[80286]] as an attribute of [[segment descriptor]]s; however, this works only on an entire segment at a time.\n\n: [[x86 memory segmentation|Segmented addressing]] has long been considered an obsolete mode of operation, and all current PC operating systems in effect bypass it, setting all segments to a base address of zero and (in their 32-bit implementation) a size of 4&nbsp; GB. AMD was the first x86-family vendor to implement no-execute in linear addressing mode. The feature is also available in legacy mode on AMD64 processors, and recent Intel x86 processors, when PAE is used.\n; Removal of older features\n: A few \"system programming\" features of the x86 architecture were either unused or underused in modern operating systems and are either not available on AMD64 in long (64-bit and compatibility) mode, or exist only in limited form. These include segmented addressing (although the FS and GS segments are retained in vestigial form for use as extra-base pointers to operating system structures),<ref name=\"amd-24593\"/>{{rp|page=70|date=November 2012}} the [[Task State Segment|task state switch]] mechanism, and [[virtual 8086 mode]]. These features remain fully implemented in \"legacy mode\", allowing these processors to run 32-bit and 16-bit operating systems without modifications. Some instructions that proved to be rarely useful are not supported in 64-bit mode, including saving/restoring of segment registers on the stack, saving/restoring of all registers (PUSHA/POPA), decimal arithmetic, BOUND and INTO instructions, and \"far\" jumps and calls with immediate operands.\n\n=== {{Anchor|VIRTUAL-ADDRESS-SPACE}}Virtual address space details ===\n\n==== Canonical form addresses ====\n{{Multiple image\n | header    = Canonical address space implementations (diagrams not to scale)\n | width     = 150\n | direction = horizontal\n | align     = right\n | image1    = AMD64-canonical--48-bit.svg\n | caption1  = Current 48-bit implementation\n | image2    = AMD64-canonical--56-bit.svg\n | caption2  = 56-bit implementation\n | image3    = AMD64-canonical--64-bit.svg\n | caption3  = 64-bit implementation\n}}\n\nAlthough virtual addresses are 64&nbsp; bits wide in 64-bit mode, current implementations (and all chips that are known to be in the planning stages) do not allow the entire virtual address space of 2<sup>64</sup> bytes (16&nbsp; EiB) to be used.\nThis would be approximately four billion times the size of the virtual address space on 32-bit machines. Most operating systems and applications will not need such a large address space for the foreseeable future, so implementing such wide virtual addresses would simply increase the complexity and cost of address translation with no real benefit. AMD, therefore, decided that, in the first implementations of the architecture, only the least significant 48&nbsp; bits of a virtual address would actually be used in address translation ([[page table]] lookup).<ref name=\"amd-24593\"/>{{rp|page=120|date=November 2012}}\n\nIn addition, the AMD specification requires that the most significant 16 bits of any virtual address,  bits 48 through 63, must be copies of bit 47 (in a manner akin to [[sign extension]]). If this requirement is not met, the processor will raise an exception.<ref name=\"amd-24593\"/>{{rp|page=131|date=November 2012}} Addresses complying with this rule are referred to as \"canonical form.\"<ref name=\"amd-24593\"/>{{rp|page=130|date=November 2012}} Canonical form addresses run from 0 through 00007FFF'FFFFFFFF, and from FFFF8000'00000000 through FFFFFFFF'FFFFFFFF, for a total of 256&nbsp;TB of usable virtual address space. This is still 65,536 times larger than the virtual 4 GB address space of 32-bit machines.\n\nThis feature eases later scalability to true 64-bit addressing. Many operating systems (including, but not limited to, the [[Windows NT]] family) take the higher-addressed half of the address space (named [[kernel space]]) for themselves and leave the lower-addressed half ([[user space]]) for application code, user mode stacks, heaps, and other data regions.<ref name=\"win-lim-msdn\"/> The \"canonical address\" design ensures that every AMD64 compliant implementation has, in effect, two memory halves: the lower half starts at 00000000'00000000 and \"grows upwards\" as more virtual address bits become available, while the higher half is \"docked\" to the top of the address space and grows downwards. Also, enforcing the \"canonical form\" of addresses by checking the unused address bits prevents their use by the operating system in [[tagged pointer]]s as flags, privilege markers, etc., as such use could become problematic when the architecture is extended to implement more virtual address bits.\n\nThe first versions of Windows for x64 did not even use the full 256&nbsp;TB; they were restricted to just 8&nbsp;TB of user space and 8&nbsp;TB of kernel space.<ref name=\"win-lim-msdn\">{{cite web|url=http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa366778(v=vs.85).aspx#memory_limits |title=Memory Limits for Windows Releases |website=[[MSDN]] |publisher=[[Microsoft]] |date=November 16, 2013 |accessdate=January 20, 2014}}</ref> Windows did not support the entire 48-bit address space until [[Windows&nbsp;8.1]], which was released in October 2013.<ref name=\"win-lim-msdn\"/> <!--- it would be good to include other OS's limits here. --->\n\n==== Page table structure ====\nThe 64-bit addressing mode (\"[[long mode]]\") is a superset of [[Physical Address Extension]]s (PAE); because of this, [[paging|page]] sizes may be 4&nbsp;[[Kilobyte|KB]] (2<sup>12</sup> bytes) or 2&nbsp;[[Megabyte|MB]] (2<sup>21</sup> bytes).<ref name=\"amd-24593\"/>{{rp|page=120|date=November 2012}} Long mode also supports page sizes of 1&nbsp;[[Gigabyte|GB]] (2<sup>30</sup> bytes).<ref name=\"amd-24593\"/>{{rp|page=120|date=November 2012}} Rather than the three-level [[page table]] system used by systems in PAE mode, systems running in [[long mode]] use four levels of page table: PAE's ''Page-Directory Pointer Table'' is extended from four entries to 512, and an additional ''Page-Map Level&nbsp;4 (PML4) Table'' is added, containing 512 entries in 48-bit implementations.<ref name=\"amd-24593\"/>{{rp|page=131|date=November 2012}} A full mapping hierarchy of 4&nbsp;KB pages for the whole 48-bit space would take a bit more than 512&nbsp;GB of memory (about 0.195% of the 256&nbsp;TB virtual space).\n\nIntel has implemented a scheme with a [[Intel 5-level paging|5-level page table]], which allows Intel 64 processors to support a 57-bit virtual address space.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://software.intel.com/sites/default/files/managed/2b/80/5-level_paging_white_paper.pdf|title=5-Level Paging and 5-Level EPT|publisher=Intel|date=May 2017|accessdate=June 17, 2017}}</ref> Further extensions may allow full 64-bit virtual address space and physical memory by expanding the page table entry size to 128-bit, and reduce page walks in the 5-level hierarchy by using a larger 64&nbsp;KB page allocation size that still supports 4&nbsp;KB page operations for backward compatibility. <Ref>{{cite patent | country = US | number = 9858198 | status = patent | title =  64KB page system that supports 4KB page operation | pridate = 2015-06-26 | fdate = 2015-06-26 | pubdate = 2016-12-29 | gdate = 2018-01-02 | invent1 = Larry Seiler | assign1 = Intel Corp.}} </ref>\n\n==== Operating system limits ====\nThe operating system can also limit the virtual address space.

It is used by 64-bit operating systems. Under a 64-bit operating system, 64-bit programs run under 64-bit mode, and 32-bit and 16-bit protected mode applications (that do not need to use either real mode or virtual 8086 mode in order to execute at any time) run under compatibility mode. Real-mode programs and programs that use virtual 8086 mode at any time cannot be run in long mode unless those modes are emulated in software.<ref name=\"amd-24593\"/>{{rp|11}} However, such programs may be started from an operating system running in long mode on processors supporting [[VT-x]] or [[AMD-V]] by creating a virtual processor running in the desired mode.\n\nSince the basic [[instruction set]] is the same, there is almost no performance penalty for executing protected mode x86 code. This is unlike Intel's [[IA-64]], where differences in the underlying instruction set mean that running 32-bit code must be done either in emulation of x86 (making the process slower) or with a dedicated x86 coprocessor. However, on the x86-64 platform, many x86 applications could benefit from a 64-bit [[recompile]], due to the additional registers in 64-bit code and guaranteed SSE2-based FPU support, which a [[compiler]] can use for optimization. However, applications that regularly handle integers wider than 32 bits, such as cryptographic algorithms, will need a rewrite of the code handling the huge integers in order to take advantage of the 64-bit registers.\n\n==== Legacy mode ====\nLegacy mode is the mode used by 32-bit or 16-bit \"protected mode\" operating systems.<ref name=\"intel-xed-1\">{{cite web |last1=Charney |first1=Mark |url=https://intelxed.github.io/ref-manual/xed-machine-mode-enum_8h.html |website=Xed |publisher=Intel Corporation |title=Xed Machine Mode Definitions |accessdate=16 June 2019}}</ref> In this mode, the processor acts like an older x86 processor, and only 16-bit and 32-bit code can be executed.

It is backwards compatible with the original [[8086]] and [[8088]] processors. Real mode is primarily used today by operating system bootloaders, which are required by the architecture to configure [[#Physical_address_space_details|virtual memory details]] before transitioning to higher modes.\n\n== Intel 64 ==\n'''Intel&nbsp;64''' is Intel's implementation of x86-64, used and implemented in various processors made by Intel.\n\n=== History ===\nHistorically, AMD has developed and produced processors with instruction sets patterned after Intel's original designs, but with x86-64, roles were reversed: Intel found itself in the position of adopting the [[instruction set architecture|ISA]] which AMD had created as an extension to Intel's own x86 processor line.\n\nIntel's project was originally [[codename]]d ''Yamhill'' (after the [[Yamhill River]] in Oregon's Willamette Valley).{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}} After several years of denying its existence, Intel announced at the February 2004 [[Intel Developer Forum|IDF]] that the project was indeed underway. Intel's chairman at the time, [[Craig Barrett (chief executive)|Craig Barrett]], admitted that this was one of their worst-kept secrets.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/1042795/craig-barrett-confirms-bit-address-extensions-xeon-and-prescott |title=Craig Barrett confirms 64 bit address extensions for Xeon.

In late 2006 Intel began instead using the name ''Intel&nbsp;64'' for its implementation, paralleling AMD's use of the name AMD64.<ref>{{cite web\n| url        = http://www.intel.com/technology/intel64/index.htm\n| title      = Intel&nbsp;64 Architecture\n| accessdate = June 29, 2007\n| publisher  = [[Intel]]\n}}</ref>\n\nThe first processor to implement Intel&nbsp;64 was the multi-socket processor [[Xeon]] code-named ''[[Xeon#Nocona and Irwindale|Nocona]]'' in June 2004. In contrast, the initial Prescott chips (February 2004) did not enable this feature. Intel subsequently began selling Intel&nbsp;64-enabled Pentium 4s using the E0 revision of the Prescott core, being sold on the OEM market as the Pentium 4, model F. The E0 revision also adds eXecute Disable (XD) (Intel's name for the [[NX bit]]) to Intel&nbsp;64, and has been included in then current Xeon code-named ''Irwindale''. Intel's official launch of Intel&nbsp;64 (under the name EM64T at that time) in mainstream desktop processors was the N0 stepping Prescott-2M.\n\nThe first Intel [[mobile processor]] implementing Intel&nbsp;64 is the [[Merom (microprocessor)|Merom]] version of the [[Core 2]] processor, which was released on July 27, 2006.

It was included as a standard distribution architecture as of 5.2-RELEASE in January 2004. Since then, FreeBSD has designated it as a Tier&nbsp;1 platform. The 6.0-RELEASE version cleaned up some quirks with running x86 executables under amd64, and most drivers work just as they do on the x86 architecture. Work is currently being done to integrate more fully the x86 [[application binary interface]] (ABI), in the same manner as the Linux 32-bit ABI compatibility currently works.\n\n==== NetBSD ====\nx86-64 architecture support was first committed to the [[NetBSD]] source tree on June 19, 2001. As of NetBSD&nbsp;2.0, released on December 9, 2004, ''NetBSD/amd64'' is a fully integrated and supported port.\n32-bit code is still supported in 64-bit mode, with a netbsd-32 kernel compatibility layer for 32-bit syscalls. The NX bit is used to provide non-executable stack and heap with per-page granularity (segment granularity being used on 32-bit x86).\n\n==== OpenBSD ====\n[[OpenBSD]] has supported AMD64 since OpenBSD 3.5, released on May 1, 2004. Complete in-tree implementation of AMD64 support was achieved prior to the hardware's initial release because AMD had loaned several machines for the project's [[hackathon]] that year. OpenBSD developers have taken to the platform because of its support for the [[NX bit]], which allowed for an easy implementation of the [[W^X]] feature.\n\nThe code for the AMD64 port of OpenBSD also runs on Intel 64 processors which contains cloned use of the AMD64 extensions, but since Intel left out the page table NX bit in early Intel 64 processors, there is no W^X capability on those Intel CPUs; later Intel 64 processors added the NX bit under the name \"XD bit\". [[Symmetric multiprocessing]] (SMP) works on OpenBSD's AMD64 port, starting with release 3.6 on November 1, 2004.\n\n=== DOS ===\nIt is possible to enter [[long mode]] under [[DOS]] without a DOS extender,<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.turboirc.com/asm |title=Tutorial for entering protected and long mode from DOS |access-date=July 6, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170222181811/http://www.turboirc.com/asm/ |archive-date=February 22, 2017 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref> but the user must return to real mode in order to call BIOS or DOS interrupts.\n\nIt may also be possible to enter [[long mode]] with a [[DOS extender]] similar to [[DOS/4GW]], but more complex since x86-64 lacks [[virtual 8086 mode]].

Thus, for example, in user mode <code>GS:0</code> is the address of the first member of the Thread Information Block. Maintaining this convention made the x86-64 port easier, but required AMD to retain the function of the FS and GS segments in long mode \u2013 even though segmented addressing ''per se'' is not really used by any modern operating system.<ref name=\"Pietrek64BitWindowsProgramming\"/>\n* Early reports claimed that the operating system scheduler would not save and restore the x87 FPU machine state across thread context switches. Observed behavior shows that this is not the case: the x87 state is saved and restored, except for kernel mode-only threads (a limitation that exists in the 32-bit version as well).

While the king was in hiding, Gajah Mada returned to the capital city to assess the situation. After learning that Kuti's rebellion was not supported by the people or nobles of Majapahit court, Gajah Mada raised resistance forces to crush the Kuti rebellion.\n\nAfter Kuti forces were defeated, Jayanegara was safely returned to his throne.

One of his distasteful acts was his desire to take his own half sisters, Gitarja and Rajadewi, as wives. Since Javanese tradition abhorred the practice of half siblings marrying, the council of royal elders spoke strongly against the king's wishes. It was not clear what motivated Jayanegara's wish \u2013 it might have been his way to ensure his claim to the throne by preventing rivals from being his half sisters' suitors, although in the later period of the Majapahit court the custom of marriage among cousins was quite common. In the ''[[Pararaton]]'', he was known as ''Kala Gemet'', or \"weak villain\". About the time of Jayanegara's reign, the Italian Friar [[Odoric of Pordenone]] visited the Majapahit court in Java.\n\nIn 1328, Jayanegara was murdered by his physician, Tanca, during a surgical operation. In complete mayhem and rage, Gajah Mada immediately killed Tanca. The motive behind this [[regicide]] was never clear. According to the ''Pararaton'', it was Tanca's revenge for the king sexually abusing his wife. However, according to the Balinese manuscript ''[[Babad Dalem]]'', the assassination was a stratagem crafted by Gajah Mada himself in order to rid the kingdom of an evil tyrant.<ref name=\"Tirto-Gajah Mada\">{{Cite web|url=https://tirto.id/gajah-mada-dan-kontroversi-dalang-pembunuhan-raja-majapahit-cCRR|title=Gajah Mada dan Kontroversi Dalang Pembunuhan Raja Majapahit|last=Raditya|first=Iswara |website=tirto.id|language=id|access-date=29 July 2019}}</ref> Tradition mentions that the immoral, cruel and abusive king often seduced and abused women, even the wives of his own subordinates.<ref>{{cite news | title = Goda Istri Orang, Raja Jayanegara Dibunuh Tabib (Bagian-2) | author = Bahari | date = 12 September 2015 | work = Sindo | language = Indonesian | url = https://daerah.sindonews.com/read/1043588/29/goda-istri-orang-raja-jayanegara-dibunuh-tabib-bagian-2-1441971107/13}}</ref> Other possible reason includes to protect the two princesses \u2013 Gitarja and Rajadewi, the daughters of Gayatri Rajapatni from the king's cruelty.<ref name=\"Tirto-Gajah Mada\"/> Since the slain king was childless, he left no successor.\n\n===Golden age===\n\n====Queen Tribhuwana Wijayatunggadewi====\n[[File:Parvati Majapahit 2.JPG|thumb|left|upright|The statue of [[Parvati]] as mortuary deified portrayal of [[Tribhuwana Wijayatunggadewi|Tribhuwanottunggadewi]], queen of Majapahit, mother of [[Hayam Wuruk]].]] \nJayanegara's stepmother, Gayatri Rajapatni \u2013 the most revered matriarch of the court \u2013 was supposed to take the helm.

After seven months of battles, Majapahit forces defeated the Balinese king and captured the Balinese capital of Bedulu in 1343. After the conquest of Bali, Majapahit distributed the governing authority of Bali among Arya Damar's younger brothers, Arya Kenceng, Arya Kutawandira, Arya Sentong, and Arya Belog. Arya Kenceng led his brothers to govern Bali under Majapahit suzerainty, and he would become the progenitor of the Balinese kings of the Tabanan and Badung royal houses. Through this campaign, Majapahit planted a vassal dynasty that would rule the [[Bali Kingdom]] in the following centuries. Tribhuwana ruled Majapahit until the death of her mother in 1350.

These Chinese voyages visited numbers of ports in Asia as far as [[Africa]], including Majapahit ports. It was said that Zheng He has paid a visit to the Majapahit court in Java.\n\nThese massive Chinese voyages were not merely a naval exploration, but also a show of power and a display of geopolitical reach.

However, perhaps the most significant Chinese intervention was its support for the newly established [[Sultanate of Malacca]], as a rival and counter-weight to the Majapahit influence of Java.<ref name=\"TOI-Sanyal\" /> \n\nPreviously, Majapahit has succeeded to assert its influence in Malacca strait by containing the aspiration of Malay polities in Sumatra and Malay Peninsula to ever reach the geopolitical might like those of Srivijaya. The Hindu Majapahit were the most powerful maritime power in Southeast Asian seas that time and were opposed to Chinese expansion into their sphere of influence. The Ming's support for Malacca, and the spread of Islam propagated by both Malacca and Zheng He's treasure fleet has weakened Majapahit maritime influence in Sumatra, which caused the northern part of the island to increasingly converting to Islam and gained independence from Majapahit, leaving [[Indragiri]], [[Jambi]] and [[Palembang]], remnants of the old [[Srivijaya]], the only suzerainty under Majapahit in Sumatra,{{efn | group=lower-roman | According to the History of Ming, only these areas in Sumatra were still mentioned as under Javanese / Majapahit supremacy at the time.

Malacca actively encouraged the conversion to [[Islam]] in the region, while Ming fleet actively established Chinese-Malay Muslim community in coastal northern Java, thus created a permanent opposition to the Hindus of Java. By 1430, the expeditions had established Muslim Chinese, Arab and Malay communities in northern ports of Java such as [[Semarang]], [[Demak, Indonesia|Demak]], [[Tuban]], and [[Surabaya|Ampel]]; thus Islam began to gain a foothold on the northern coast of Java.

After Kertawijaya died, [[Bhre Pamotan]] became a king with formal name Rajasawardhana. He died in 1453. A three-year kingless period was possibly the result of a succession crisis. [[Girisawardhana]], son of Kertawijaya, came to power in 1456. He died in 1466 and was succeeded by Singhawikramawardhana.\n\n====The divide====\nIn 1468 Prince Kertabhumi rebelled against Singhawikramawardhana, promoting himself as the king of Majapahit. Deposed Singhawikramawardhana retreated upstream of Brantas River, moved the kingdom's capital further inland to [[Kediri (city)|Daha]] (the former capital of [[Kediri (historical kingdom)|Kediri kingdom]]), effectively splitting Majapahit, under Bhre Kertabumi in Trowulan and Singhawikramawardhana in Daha. Singhawikramawardhana continued his rule until he was succeeded by his son [[Girindrawardhana]] (Ranawijaya) in 1474.\n\nAnd in between this period of the dividing court of Majapahit, the kingdom found itself unable to control its western part of the already crumbling empire. The rising power of the [[Sultanate of Malacca]] began to gain effective control of [[Strait of Malacca|Malacca Strait]] in the mid-15th century and expanding its influence to Sumatra. And amidst these events, Indragiri and Siantan, according to [[Malay Annals]] were given to Malacca as a dowry for the marriage of a Majapahit princess and the [[Mansur Shah of Malacca|sultan of Malacca]].<ref name=\"Leyden\">Leyden, John (1821)[https://books.google.co.id/books?id=J9JAAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q&f=false Malay Annals (translated from the Malay language)], Longman, Hurst, Rees, Orme and Brown.</ref>, further weakening Majapahit's influence on the western part of the archipelago. Kertabhumi managed to stabilized this situation by allying with Muslim merchants, giving them trading rights on the north coast of Java, with [[Demak Regency|Demak]] as its centre and in return asked for their loyalty to Majapahit. This policy boosted the Majapahit treasury and power, but weakened Hindu-Buddhism as its main religion because [[Dawah|Islamic proselytizing]] spread faster, especially in Javanese coastal principalities.

The refugees fled to the east to avoid Demak retribution for their support for Ranawijaya against Kertabhumi. \n\nDemak came under the leadership of Raden (later crowned as Sultan) Patah (Arabic name: Fatah, lit. \"liberator\", \"conqueror\"), who was acknowledged as the legitimate successor of Majapahit. According to Babad Tanah Jawi and Demak tradition, the source of Patah's legitimacy was because their first sultan, Raden Patah, was the son of Majapahit king Brawijaya V with a Chinese concubine. Another argument supports Demak as the successor of Majapahit; the rising Demak sultanate was easily accepted as the nominal regional ruler, as Demak was the former Majapahit vassal and located near the former Majapahit realm in Eastern Java.\n\nDemak established itself as the regional power and the first Islamic sultanate in Java. After the fall of Majapahit, the Hindu kingdoms in Java only remained in [[Blambangan]] on the eastern edge and [[Sunda Kingdom|Pajajaran]] in the western part. Gradually [[Hindu]] communities began to retreat to the mountain ranges in East Java and also to the neighbouring island of [[Bali]]. A small enclave of [[Tenggerese people|Hindu communities]] still remain in the [[Tengger caldera|Tengger]] mountain range.\n\n== Military ==\nAccording to History of Yuan, soldiers of early Majapahit era were mainly dominated by poorly equipped light [[infantry]]. During the Mongol invasion of Java, Javanese army was described as temporarily mobilized farmers and a few noble warriors. The nobility marched at the front line, with huge rear army composed of peasants. The Javanese peasant army was half-naked and covered with cotton fabric at the waist ([[sarung]]). Most of the weapons are bows and arrows, [[bamboo]] spears, and short blades.

Unlike the earlier naturalistic, relaxed and flowing figures of classical Central Java style ([[Sailendra]] art c. 8th to 10th century), this East Javanese style demonstrates a stiffer pose, stylised and rendered in [[wayang]]-like figures, such as those carved on East Javanese temple's bas-reliefs. The bas-reliefs were projected rather flat from the background. This style was later preserved in [[Balinese art]], especially in its [[Kamasan]] style classical paintings and Balinese wayang.\n\nThe statues of Hindu gods and Buddhist deities in Majapahit art were also the continuisation of its previous Singhasari art. The statues of East Javanese period tends to be stiffer and frontal-formal pose, compared to the statues of Central Javanese art (c. 9th century) that are more Indianized style, relaxed in [[tribhanga]] pose. The stiffer pose of Majapahit gods statues are probably in accordance to the statue's function as the deified portrayal self of the dead Majapahit monarch. The carving however, are richly decorated, especially with fine floral carving of lotus plants carved on the stela behind the statue. Examples of Majapahit statues are the Harihara statue from Simping temple, believed to be the deified portrayal of [[Raden Wijaya|King Kertarajasa]], the statue of Parwati believed to be the portrayal of [[Tribhuwana Wijayatunggadewi|Queen Tribhuwana]], and statue of queen [[Suhita]] discovered at Jebuk, Kalangbret, Tulungagung, East Java.\n\n[[File:Pair of door guardians SF Asian Art Museum.JPG|thumb|left|Pair of door guardians from a temple, Eastern Java, 14th century, [[Asian Art Museum of San Francisco|Museum of Asian Art, San Francisco]].]]\n\nClay pottery and brick masonry are popular feature in Majapahit art and architecture.

It is probably the origin of Javanese-Indonesian word to refer for saving or money container. The word ''celengan'' in [[Javanese language|Javanese]] and [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]] means both \"savings\" and \"piggy bank\". It was derived from the word ''celeng'' which means \"wild boar\", the [[suffix]] \"-an\" was added to denote its likeness. One important specimen is stored in National Museum of Indonesia, it has been reconstructed since this large piggy bank has been found broken to pieces.\n\nTerracotta money boxes also has been found in different shapes, such as tubular or boxes, with slits to slip coins. Another important terracotta artefact is the head figurine of a man popularly thought to be the depiction of Gajah Mada, although it is not certain about who was depicted in these figurines.\n\n===Architecture===\n{{further|Candi of Indonesia}}\n[[File:Candi Jabung B.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Jabung]] temple near Paiton, Probolinggo, East Java, dated from Majapahit period.]]\n\nIn his book ''Yingya Shenglan'', Ma Huan also describes the Majapahit cities: most of them do not have walls surrounding the city or the suburbs. He describes the king's palace in Majapahit. The king's residence is surrounded with thick red brick walls more than three ''[[zhang (unit)|chang]]'' high (about {{convert|30.5|ft|m|abbr=off|disp=or}}), with length of more than 200 paces ({{convert|340|yd|m|abbr=off|disp=or}}) and on the wall there are two layers of gates, the palace is very well guarded and clean. The king's palace was a two-storey building, each of them 3 or 4 ''chang'' high ({{convert|9\u201314.5|m|abbr=off|disp=or}}). It had wooden plank floors and exposed mats made from rattan or reeds (presumably palm leaves), where people sat cross-legged. The roof was made of hardwood shingles (Javanese:''sirap'') laid as tiles.<ref name=yingyai />\n\nThe houses of commoners had thatched roofs ([[nipa palm]] leaves). Every family has a storage shed made of bricks, about 3 or 4 ''[[Chi (unit)|Ch'ih]]'' ({{convert|48.9|in|cm|abbr=off|disp=or}}) above the ground, where they kept the family property, and they lived on top of this building, to sit and sleep.\n\nThe Majapahit temple architecture follows the east Javanese styles, in contrast of earlier central Javanese style. This east Javanese temple style is also dated back from Kediri period c. 11th century. The shapes of Majapahit temples are tends to be slender and tall, with roof constructed from multiple parts of stepped sections formed a combined roof structure curved upward smoothly creating the [[Perspective (visual)|perspective illussion]] that the temple is perceived taller than its actual height. The pinnacle of the temples are usually cube (mostly Hindu temples), sometimes dagoba cylindrical structures (Buddhist temples). Although some of temples dated from Majapahit period used [[andesite]] or [[sandstone]], the red [[brick]]s is also a popular construction material.\n\n[[File:Bajang Ratu Gate Trowulan.jpg|left|upright|thumb|The 16.5-metre tall Bajang Ratu [[Paduraksa]] gate, at Trowulan, echoed the grandeur of Majapahit.]]\n\nAlthough [[brick]] had been used in the ''[[Candi of Indonesia|candi]]'' of Indonesia's classical age, it was Majapahit architects of the 14th and 15th centuries who mastered it.<ref name=\"Schoppert1997\">{{cite book|author=Schoppert, P., Damais, S.|title=Java Style|year=1997|publisher=Periplus Editions|editor=Didier Millet|location=Paris|pages=33\u201334|isbn=962-593-232-1}}</ref> Making use of a vine sap and [[palm sugar]] mortar, their temples had a strong geometric quality. The example of Majapahit temples are Brahu temple in Trowulan, [[Pari Temple|Pari]] in Sidoarjo, [[Jabung]] in Probolinggo, and [[Candi Surawana|Surawana temple]] near Kediri. Jabung temple was mentioned in Nagarakretagama as Bajrajinaparamitapura, despite some parts of its roof and pinnacles are now missing, it is one of the most well-preserved Majapahit temple architecture. Another example include Gunung Gangsir temple near Pasuruan. Some of the temples are dated from earlier period but renovated and expanded during Majapahit era, such as [[Candi Penataran|Penataran]], the largest temple in East Java dated back to [[Kediri (historical kingdom)|Kediri]] era. This temple was identified in Nagarakretagama as Palah temple and reported being visited by King Hayam Wuruk during his royal tour across East Java. Another notable temple of Eastern Javanese style is [[Jawi temple]] in Pandaan \u2013 also visited by King Hayam Wuruk, the temple was mentioned in Nagarakretagama as Jajawa, and was dedicated as mortuary temple for his great grandfather, King Kertanegara of Singhasari.\n\nSome of typical architectural style are believed to be developed during Majapahit era; such as tall and slender roofed red brick gate commonly called as ''kori agung'' or ''[[paduraksa]]'', and also split gate of ''[[candi bentar]]''. The large split gate of Wringin Lawang located at Jatipasar, Trowulan, Mojokerto, East Java, is one of the oldest and the largest surviving ''candi bentar'' dated from Majapahit era. The ''candi bentar'' took shape of typical Majapahit temple structure \u2013 consists of three parts; foot, body and tall roof \u2013 evenly split into two mirroring structures to make a passage in the centre for people to walk through. This type of split gate has no doors and provides no real defensive purpose but narrowing the passage. It was probably only serve the ceremonial and aesthetic purpose, to create the sense of grandeur, before entering the next compound through tall roof ''paduraksa'' gate with enclosed door. The example of ''kori agung'' or ''paduraksa'' style gate is the elegant Bajang Ratu gate richly decorated with Kala demon, cyclops and also the bas-relief telling the story of Sri Tanjung. Those typical Majapahit architectural style has deeply influenced the Javanese and [[Balinese architecture]] of later period. The current prevalence of Majapahit style pendopo pavilion, candi bentar and paduraksa gates, was owed to the influence of Majapahit aesthetics on Javanese and Balinese architecture.<ref name=\"Made Wijaya\">{{cite book | title = Majapahit Style Vol.1 | author = Made Wijaya | publisher = Wijaya Words - a division of Yayasan Beringin Berapi| year = 2014 | isbn = 9786027136700| url = https://books.google.com/books/about/Majapahit_Style_Vol_1.html?id=J3GMBAAAQBAJ&redir_esc=y}}</ref>\n\nIn later period near the fall of Majapahit, the art and architecture of Majapahit witnessed the revival of indigenous native Austronesian [[megalithic architectural elements]], such as [[Candi Sukuh|Sukuh]] and [[Candi Cetho|Cetho]] temples on western slopes of [[Mount Lawu]]. Unlike previous Majapahit temples that demonstrate typical Hindu architecture of high-rise towering structure, the shape of these temples are [[step pyramid]], quite similar to Mesoamerican [[pyramid]]s. The stepped pyramid structure called ''Punden Berundak'' (stepped mounds) is a common megalithic structure during [[Prehistoric Indonesia|Indonesian prehistoric era]] before the adoption of Hindu-Buddhist culture.\n\n==Economy==\nAlso in ''Yingya Shenglan'', Ma Huan reported the Javanese economy and market. [[Rice]] is harvested twice a year, and its grain is small. They also harvest white [[sesame]] and [[lentil]]s, but there is no [[wheat]]. This land produces [[Sapan Wood|sapan wood]] (useful to produce red dye), [[diamond]]s, [[sandalwood]], [[incense]], ''puyang'' pepper, [[cantharides]] (green beetles used for medicine), [[steel]], [[turtle]]s, tortoise shell, strange and rare birds; such as a large [[parrot]] as big as a hen, red and green parrots, five-colored parrots, (all of them can imitate the human voice), also [[guinea fowl]], ' bird hanging upside down ', five-coloured pigeon, [[peacock]], 'betel tree bird', pearl bird, and green pigeons.

''Mang-chi-shi'' \u2013 is something like a pomegranate, peel it like an orange, it has four lumps of white flesh, sweet and sour taste and very delicious. ''Lang-ch\u2019a'' is a fruit similar to Loquat, but larger, contained three blocky white flesh with sweet and sour taste. Sugarcane has white stems, large and coarse, with roots reaching 3 ''chang'' (30 feet 7 inches).

Previously, the 9th-century [[Wonoboyo hoard]] discovered in Central Java shows that ancient Javan gold coins were seed-shaped, similar to corn, while the silver coins were similar to buttons. In about the year 1300, in the reign of Majapahit's first king, an important change took place: the indigenous coinage was completely replaced by imported Chinese copper cash. About 10,388 ancient Chinese coins weighing about 40&nbsp;kg were even unearthed from the backyard of a local commoner in [[Sidoarjo]] in November 2008. Indonesian Ancient Relics Conservation Bureau (BP3) of East Java verified that those coins dated as early as Majapahit era.<ref>{{cite web | title = Uang Kuno Temuan Rohimin Peninggalan Majapahit | url = http://www.kompas.com/read/xml/2008/11/24/17571290/uang.kuno.temuan.rohimin.peninggalan.majapahit. | date = November 2008 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131031003554/http://www.kompas.com/read/xml/2008/11/24/17571290/uang.kuno.temuan.rohimin.peninggalan.majapahit. | archivedate = 31 October 2013}}</ref> The reason for using foreign currency is not given in any source, but most scholars assume it was due to the increasing complexity of Javanese economy and a desire for a [[currency]] system that used much smaller denominations suitable for use in everyday market transactions. This was a role for which gold and silver are not well suited.<ref name=miksic />{{rp | page=107}} These ''kepeng'' Chinese coins were thin rounded copper coins with a square hole in the centre of it. The hole was meant to tie together the money in a string of coins. These small changes\u2014the imported Chinese copper coins\u2014enabled Majapahit further invention, a method of savings by using a slitted earthenware coin containers. These are commonly found in Majapahit ruins, the slit is the small opening to put the coins in. The most popular shape is boar-shaped ''celengan'' (piggy bank).\n\nSome idea of scale of the internal economy can be gathered from scattered data in inscriptions. The Canggu inscriptions dated 1358 mentions 78 ferry crossings in the country (mandala Java).<ref name=miksic />{{rp | page=107}} Majapahit inscriptions mention a large number of occupational specialities, ranging from gold and silver smiths to drink vendors and butchers. Although many of these occupations had existed in earlier times, the proportion of the population earning an income from non-agrarian pursuits seems to have become even greater during the Majapahit era.\n\nThe great prosperity of Majapahit was probably due to two factors. Firstly, the northeast lowlands of Java were suitable for rice [[Tillage|cultivation]], and during Majapahit's prime numerous [[irrigation]] projects were undertaken, some with government assistance. Secondly, Majapahit's ports on the north coast were probably significant stations along the route to obtain the spices of [[Maluku Islands|Maluku]], and as the spices passed through Java they would have provided an important source of income for Majapahit.<ref name=miksic />{{rp|page=107}}\n\nThe Nagarakretagama states that the fame of the ruler of Wilwatikta (a synonym for Majapahit) attracted foreign merchants from far and wide, including Indians, Khmers, Siamese, and Chinese among others. While in later period, ''Yingya Shenglan'' mentioned that large numbers of Chinese traders and Muslim merchants from west (from Arab and India, but mostly from Muslim states in Sumatra and Malay peninsula) are settling in Majapahit port cities, such as Tuban, Gresik and Hujung Galuh ([[Surabaya]]). A special tax was levied against some foreigners, possibly those who had taken up semi-permanent residence in Java and conducted some type of enterprise other than foreign trade. The Majapahit Empire had trading links with Chinese [[Ming dynasty]], [[Vietnam|Annam]] and [[Champa]] in today Vietnam, [[Cambodia]], Siamese [[Ayutthaya Kingdom|Ayutthayan]], Burmese [[Martaban]] and the south Indian [[Vijayanagara Empire]].\n\n==Administration==\n{{multiple image|align=right| direction = vertical|total_width=150|image1=Surya Majapahit.jpg|image2=Surya Majapahit 2.jpg|image3=Candi Ceto Majapahit Sun, Surakarta 1264.jpg|footer=Three designs of [[Surya Majapahit]], the sun emblem of the kingdom.}}\n\nDuring the reign of [[Hayam Wuruk]], Majapahit employed a well-organised bureaucratic structure for administrative purposes. The hierarchy and structure relatively remain intact and unchanged throughout Majapahit history.<ref name=\"SNI451\">Poesponegoro & Notosusanto (1990), hal. 451\u2013456.</ref> The king is the paramount ruler, as the [[chakravartin]] he is considered as the universal ruler and believed to be the living god on earth. The king holds the highest political authority and legitimacy.\n\n===Bureaucracy officials===\nDuring his daily administration, the king is assisted by bureaucratic state officials that also included the close relatives of the kings that hold certain esteemed titles. The royal order or edict usually transmitted from the king to the high officials well to their subordinates. The officials in Majapahit courts are:\n:* ''Rakryan Mahamantri Katrini'', usually reserved for the king's heir\n:* ''Rakryan Mantri ri Pakira-kiran'', the board of [[Minister (government)|ministers]] that conduct the daily administration\n:* ''Dharmmadhyaksa'', the officials of laws, state laws as well as religious laws\n:* ''Dharmma-upapatti'', the officials concerning religious affairs\n\nWithin the ministers of ''Rakryan Mantri ri Pakira-kiran'' there is the most important and the highest minister titled ''Rakryan Mapatih'' or ''Patih Hamangkubhumi''. This position is analogous to [[prime minister]], and together with king, they determine the important state policies, including war or peace. Among the Dharmmadhyaksa officials there is ''Dharmmadhyaksa ring Kasewan'' (State's highest Hindu [[Shivaist]] priest) and ''Dharmmadhyaksa ring Kasogatan'' (State's highest Buddhist priest), both are the religious laws authorities of each dharmic faiths.\n\nThere is also the board of advisors which consists of the elders within royal family called ''Bhattara Saptaprabhu''. This council consists of seven influential elders\u2014mostly directly related to the king. They are the ''Bhres'' (Duke or Duchess) acted as regional kings, the rulers of Majapahit provinces. This council congregates, offers advice, gave consideration to the king, and often formed an assembly to judge a certain important case in the court. Example of their office was, their sentence to temporarily suspend Mahamantri Gajah Mada, as a punishment since he was held responsible for the shamefully disastrous [[Battle of Bubat|Bubat incident]]. The council also sentenced the execution of Raden Gajah (Narapati) for decapitating Bhre Wirabhumi in [[Paregreg war]].<ref name=\"BP-Sejarah Nasional\">{{cite book | title = Sejarah nasional Indonesia: Zaman kuno \u2013 Volume 2 dari Sejarah nasional Indonesia | author1= Marwati Djoened Poesponegoro | author2= Soejono (R.

This region is ruled by provincial kings called ''Paduka Bhattara'' with the title ''Bhre''. This title is the highest position below the monarch and similar to duke or duchess. Usually this position reserved for the close relatives of the king. Their duty is to administer their own provinces, collect taxes, send annual tributes to the capital, and manage the defences of their borders.\n\nDuring the reign of Hayam Wuruk (1350\u20131389) there were 12 provinces of Majapahit, administered by king's close relatives:\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" border=\"1\" width=\"80%\"\n! width=\"260\" |Provinces\n! width=\"120\" |Titles\n! width=\"140\" |Rulers\n! width=\"260\" |Relation to the King\n|-\n|[[Kahuripan]] (or [[Janggala]], today [[Sidoarjo Regency|Sidoarjo]])\n|Bhre Kahuripan\n|Tribhuwanatunggadewi\n|queen mother\n|-\n|Daha (former capital of [[Kediri (historical kingdom)|Kediri]])\n|Bhre Daha\n|Rajadewi Maharajasa\n|aunt and also mother-in-law\n|-\n|Tumapel (former capital of [[Singhasari]])\n|Bhre Tumapel\n|Kertawardhana\n|father\n|-\n|Wengker (today [[Ponorogo]])\n|Bhre Wengker\n|Wijayarajasa\n|uncle and also father-in-law\n|-\n|Matahun (today [[Bojonegoro]])\n|Bhre Matahun\n|Rajasawardhana\n|husband of the duchess of Lasem, king's cousin\n|-\n|Wirabhumi ([[Blambangan]])\n|Bhre Wirabhumi\n|Bhre Wirabhumi{{efn | group=lower-roman | 1=Bhre Wirabhumi is actually the title: the Duke of Wirabhumi (Blambangan), the real name is unknown.

The traditional or initial area of Majapahit during its formation before entering the imperial phase. This includes the capital city and the surrounding areas where the king effectively exercises his government. The area in and around royal capital of [[Trowulan]], port of Canggu and sections of [[Brantas River]] valley near the capital, also mountainous areas south and southeast of capital, all the way to [[Mount Penanggungan|Pananggungan]] and [[Arjuno-Welirang]] peaks, are the core realm of the kingdom. The Brantas river valley corridor, connecting Majapahit Trowulan area to Canggu and estuarine areas in Kahuripan (Sidoarjo) and [[Janggala|Hujung Galuh]] port (Surabaya) are considered as parts of ''Negara Agung''.\n* '''''Mancanegara''''', areas surrounding ''Negara Agung'' \u2014 traditionally refer to Majapahit provinces in East and Central Java. This area covered the eastern half of Java, with all its provinces ruled by the ''Bhres'' (dukes), the king's close relatives. These areas are directly influenced by Javanese Majapahit court culture, and obliged to pay annual tributes. These areas usually possess their own rulers that might be directly related, foster an alliance or intermarried with the Majapahit royal family. Majapahit stationed their officials and officers in these places and regulate their foreign trade activities and collect taxes, yet they enjoyed substantial internal autonomy. This includes the rest of [[Java]] island, [[Madura]] and [[Bali]]. However, in later period, overseas provinces which has developed culture reflected or comparable to those of Java, or possess significant trading importance, are also considered as ''mancanegara''. Either the province has their own native rulers subject (vassal) to the king, or a regent appointed and sent by the king to rule the region. This realm includes [[Melayu Kingdom|Dharmasraya]], [[Pagaruyung Kingdom|Pagaruyung]], [[Lampung]] and [[Palembang]] in [[Sumatra]].\n* '''''Nusantara''''', areas which do not reflect Javanese culture, but are included as colonies and they had to pay annual tribute. They had their native polity intact, enjoyed substantial autonomy and internal freedom, and Majapahit did not necessarily station their officials or military officers here; however, any challenges on Majapahit oversight might draw severe response. These areas such as the vassal kingdoms and colonies in [[Malay peninsula]], [[Borneo]], [[Lesser Sunda Islands]], [[Sulawesi]] and [[Maluku Islands|Maluku]].\n[[File:Filippine, provincia di agusan, immagine hindu, statuetta in oro massiccio, xiii secolo.jpg|left|thumb|upright|A 1.79 kilogram, 21-karat Majapahit period [[Golden Tara|gold image]] discovered in [[Esperanza, Agusan|Agusan]], [[Philippines]], copied Nganjuk bronze images of the early Majapahit period,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://digitalcollections.universiteitleiden.nl/view/item/7096|title=[Bronze statues from Nganjuk] OD-3577 {{!}} Digital Collections|website=digitalcollections.universiteitleiden.nl|access-date=2020-03-15}}</ref> signify Majapahit cultural influence on southern Philippines.]]\n\n[[Nagarakretagama#Descriptions of the Majapahit realm|Nagarakretagama]] mentioned more than 80 places in the archipelago described as the vassal states.<ref name=\"Britannica-Majapahit\"/> In Canto 13, several lands on [[Sumatra]] are mentioned, and some possibly correspond to contemporary areas: [[Jambi]], [[Palembang]], Teba ([[Toba Samosir Regency|Toba]]), and [[Dharmasraya]].

According to [[Waringin Pitu inscription]] (dated 1447) it was mentioned that Majapahit's core realm was consisted of 14 provinces, that administrated by the ruler titled ''Bhre''.<ref>Nastiti, Titi Surti.

Since early of its formation, Majapahit inherited the foreign outlook of its predecessor entity \u2013 [[Singhasari]] kingdom, in which its last king [[Kertanegara]] projected his influence abroad by launching [[Pamalayu]] expedition (1275-1293) to incorporate Malay polities in Sumatra and Malay Peninsula within Javanese sphere of influence. Previously, Singhasari seeks to dominate trade route, especially Malacca strait, and also saw the outreach of Mongolian-Chinese Yuan influence into Southeast Asia as the threat to their own interest.\n\nDuring its formation, the returning Pamalayu expedition in 1293 has brought Malayu Kingdoms in Jambi and Dharmasraya under Javanese suzerainty. Therefore, Java often seen itself as the overlord of most of polities in the Indonesian archipelago. In Sumatran front, Majapahit did capture Palembang, Jambi and Dharmasraya, invade [[Samudera Pasai Sultanate|Pasai]], and it also saw the settlement of [[Temasek|Tumasik]], that later become [[Kingdom of Singapura]], as its rebellious colony, and thus deal with them accordingly.\n\nDuring the reign of Majapahit's first two monarch \u2013 Wijaya and Jayanegara, the kingdom struggled to consolidate its rule, plagued by a number of rebellions. However, it was not until the reign of its third monarch \u2013 Queen Tribhuwana Tunggadewi, and her son, Hayam Wuruk \u2013 that the kingdom began to projected its power overseas. Majapahit's confidence for dominance was stemmed for their economic and demographic comparative advantage; agrarian as well as maritime nation; their large rice production, immense human resources, well-organized society, also their mastery in shipbuilding, navigation and military technology; are excellent relatively compared to their neighbours. These strengths were used by Gajah Mada to expand the kingdom's influence and building a maritime empire. This rather imperialistic outlooks, has projected in the way he forcefully dealt with Majapahit's neighbours; the Pabali (conquest of Bali, 1342\u20131343) and the [[Battle of Bubat|Pasunda Bubat]] (1356). Majapahit pulled Bali into their orbit as a vassal state. While the disastrous diplomacy with Sunda kingdom has led to the enmity among them.\n\nWithin Indonesian archipelago, Majapahit saw itself as the center of a huge mandala. This notion is demonstrated by its three tier administrative hierarchy; Nagara Agung, Mancanegara, and Nusantara. Outside of Maritime Southeast Asia, Majapahit devices Mitreka Satata, or partner in common order, in which it saw several states as ally. They are [[Ayutthaya Kingdom|Ayutthaya]], [[Nakhon Si Thammarat kingdom]], [[Ratchaburi]], [[Songkla]], [[Mottama]], [[Champa]], [[Cambodia]], and [[Vietnam|Annam]].\n\nIn later years after the era of Hayam Wuruk, Majapahit has lost their grips on some of their overseas possessions. This led to the thrive and the rise of several polities previously held under Majapahit domination, such as [[Bruneian Empire|Brunei]] and [[Malacca Sultanate|Malacca]]. The rise of Malacca in 15th century in particular is important, because it represents Majapahit eventual failure to control Malacca strait. Previously Majapahit tried to contain the rise of a potential regional rival; a Malay polity in par with Srivijaya, by punishing a rebellion in Palembang and capturing Singapura. In this sense, Malacca was indeed the rival of Majapahit in the competition to dominate the archipelagic realm. Despite this perceived rivalry, in practice however, the two kingdoms actually had some close and intense economic and cultural relations. At that time, the trade link between Majapahit ports of Hujung Galuh and Tuban with port of Melaka must be thriving.\n\nMajapahit true rival for domination however, was the powerful [[Ming Dynasty|Ming Chinese]]. After the fall of Yuan, the Ming Emperor eager to project his power into Southeast Asia. On the other hand Majapahit saw this archipelagic realm as theirs and unwelcome to any perceived Chinese interference. After Majapahit was weaken by Paregreg civil war, and incessant conflicts among its nobles, the arrival of the formidable [[Ming treasure voyages]] led by [[Zheng He]] upon Majapahit shores has pushed Majapahit prestigue and power to the side. Ming on the other hand, actively support the rise of Malacca. This Ming protection has made Majapahit unwilling and unable to push Malacca anymore. \n\nMajapahit true nemesis however, was located very close at home; the [[Demak Sultanate]] on northern coast of Central Java. Ming support to Malacca, and Malacca active proselytizing of Islam, has led to the thrive and rise of Muslim traders community in the archipelago, including in Majapahit ports on the north coast of Java. This in turn gradually corroded the prestigue of Javanese Hindu-Buddhist kingship, and after several generations, led to the fall of once mighty Majapahit empire.\n\n==Legacy==\n[[File:Pura Maospahit Denpasar Bali.jpg|thumb|right|''Pura Maospahit'' (\"Majapahit Temple\") in [[Denpasar]], Bali, demonstrate the typical Majapahit red brick architecture.]]\n\nMajapahit was the largest empire ever to form in Southeast Asia.<ref name=miksic />{{rp|page=107}} Although its political power beyond the core area in east Java was diffuse, constituting mainly ceremonial recognition of suzerainty, Majapahit society developed a high degree of sophistication in both commercial and artistic activities.

Other than Javanese sources, some regional legends mentioning Majapahit kingdom or its general Gajah Mada, also can be found; from Aceh, Minangkabau, Palembang, Malay Peninsula, Sunda, Brunei, Bali to Sumbawa. Most of them mentioned about the incoming Javanese forces to their land, which was probably a local testament of the empire's expansive nature that once dominating the archipelago. The [[Hikayat Raja-raja Pasai|Hikayat Raja Pasai]], a 14th-century [[Aceh]] chronicle tell a Majapahit naval invasion against [[Samudra Pasai]] in 1350. The chronicle described that the Majapahit invasion was a punishment for Sultan Ahmad Malik Az-Zahir's crime on ruining a royal marriage between Pasai Prince Tun Abdul Jalil and Raden Galuh Gemerencang, a Majapahit princess \u2013 that led to the death of the royal couple.<ref name=\"Tirto-Pasai\"/> \n[[File:Masjid Menara Kudus.jpg|thumb|left|The Majapahit style minaret of Kudus Mosque.]]\nIn West Sumatra, the [[Minangkabau (legend)|legend of Minangkabau]] mentioned an invading foreign prince \u2013 associated with Javanese Majapahit kingdom \u2013 being defeated in a buffalo fight.<ref name=\"Sindo-Minangkabau\"/> In West Java, the [[Battle of Bubat|Pasunda Bubat]] tragedy caused a myth to revolve around Indonesians, which forbids marriage between a [[Sundanese people|Sundanese]] and a [[Javanese people|Javanese]], as it would be unsustainable and only bring misery to the couple.<ref>{{cite news | title = Tragedi Perang Bubat dan mitos orang jawa dilarang kawin dengan sunda | date = 24 April 2015 | author = Hery H Winarno | url = https://www.merdeka.com/peristiwa/tragedi-perang-bubat-mitos-orang-jawa-dilarang-kawin-dengan-sunda.html | language = Indonesian}}</ref> In Malay peninsula, the [[Malay annals]] mentioned the legend of the fall of [[Kingdom of Singapura|Singapura]] to Majapahit forces in 1398 was due to the betrayal of Sang Rajuna Tapa that opened the fortified city gate.<ref>{{harvnb|A.

The [[Panji (prince)|Panji cycles]], the tale of [[Sri Tanjung]], and the epic of [[Damarwulan]], are popular tales in Javanese and [[Balinese literature]]s. The tales of Panji was dated from older period during Kediri kingdom, while the tale of Sri Tanjung and the epic of Damarwulan took place during Majapahit period. These tales remained a popular theme in Javanese culture of later period during Mataram Sultanate, and often became the source of inspiration for [[wayang]] shadow puppet performance, [[ketoprak]] and [[topeng]] dance drama. The Panji tales in particular have spread from East Java to become a source of inspiration for literature and dance drama throughout the region, as far as Malay peninsula, Cambodia and Siam where he is known as Raden Inao or Enau ({{lang-th|\u0e2d\u0e34\u0e40\u0e2b\u0e19\u0e32}}) of Kurepan.{{Sfn|Holt|1967|p=274}}\n\nMajapahit had a momentous and lasting influence on [[Indonesian art]] and [[Indonesian architecture|architecture]]. The empire's expansion circa 14th-century, contributed to the difussion Javanese cultural influence throughout the archipelago, which can be seen as a form of [[Javanisation]]. It was probably during this period that some of Javanese cultural elements, such as [[gamelan]]<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.thoughtco.com/history-of-gamelan-195131|title=Learn the History Behind Gamelan, Indonesian Music and Dance|work=ThoughtCo|access-date=13 November 2018}}</ref> and kris, being expanded and introduced to islands outside of Java. The descriptions of the architecture of the capital's pavilions (''[[pendopo]]'') in the ''Nagarakretagama'' evoke the Javanese [[Kraton (Indonesia)|Kraton]] also the [[Pura (Balinese temple)|Balinese temples]] and palace compounds of today. The Majapahit architectural style that often employs [[Majapahit Terracotta|terracotta]] and [[red brick]] heavily influenced the architecture of Java and Bali in the later period. The Majapahit style ''[[candi bentar]]'' split gate, the ''kori'' or ''[[paduraksa]]'' towering red brick gate, and also ''pendopo'' pavilion have become ubiquitous in Javanese and Balinese architectural features, as seen in [[Menara Kudus Mosque]], [[Keraton Kasepuhan]] and Sunyaragi park in [[Cirebon]], [[Mataram Sultanate]] royal cemetery in [[Kota Gede]], [[Yogyakarta]], and various palaces and temples in Bali.<ref name=\"Made Wijaya\"/>\n\n[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Bas-reli\u00ebfs op het Pendopo Terras Panataran tempelcomplex TMnr 20027152.jpg|thumb|right|Bas relief from [[Candi Penataran]] describes the Javanese-style [[pendopo]] pavilion, commonly found across Java and Bali.]]\n\nThe vivid, rich and festive [[Balinese people#Culture|Balinese culture]] is considered as one of Majapahit legacy. The Javanese Hindu civilisation since the era of [[Airlangga]] to the era of Majapahit kings has profoundly influenced and shaped the Balinese culture and [[History of Bali|history]].<ref>[http://www.lonelyplanet.com/indonesia/bali/history Lonely Planet: History of Bali]</ref> The ancient links and Majapahit legacy is observable in many ways; architecture, literature, religious rituals, dance-drama and artforms. The aesthetics and style of bas-reliefs in Majapahit East Javanese temples were preserved and copied in Balinese temples. It is also due to the fact that after the fall of the empire, many Majapahit nobles, artisans and priests had taken refuge either in the interior mountainous region of East Java or across the narrow strait to Bali. Indeed, in some ways the [[Bali Kingdom|Kingdom of Bali]] was the successor of Majapahit. Large numbers of Majapahit manuscripts, such as [[Nagarakretagama]], [[Kakawin Sutasoma|Sutasoma]], [[Pararaton]] and [[Tantu Pagelaran]], were being well-kept in royal libraries of Bali and Lombok, and provides the glimpse and valuable historical records on Majapahit. The Majapahit Hindu-Javanese culture has shaped the culture of Bali, that led to popular expression; \"without Java there is no Bali\". Yet in return, Bali is credited as the last stronghold to safeguard and preserve the ancient Hindu Javanese civilisation.\n\n[[File:WLANL - mchangsp - Kris van Knaud.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Kris of Knaud]], one of the oldest surviving kris is dated to Majapahit period]]\n\nIn weaponry, the Majapahit expansion is believed to be responsible for the widespread use of the [[Kris|keris]] dagger in Southeast Asia; from Java, Bali, Sumatra, Malaysia, Brunei to Southern Thailand.

The history of Majapahit continues to inspire contemporary artists.]]\nCelebrated as 'the golden era of the archipelago', the Majapahit empire has inspired many writers and artists (and continues to do so) to create their works based on this era, or to describe and mention it. The impact of the Majapahit theme on popular culture can be seen in the following:\n\n# ''Sandyakalaning Majapahit'' (1933), or Twilight/Sunset in Majapahit is an historical romance that took place during the fall of Majapahit empire, written by [[Sanusi Pane]].\n# ''Panji Koming'' (since 1979), a weekly [[comic strip]] by Dwi Koendoro published in the Sunday edition of [[Kompas]], telling the everyday life of Panji Koming, a common Majapahit citizen. Although it took place in the Majapahit era, the comic strip serves as witty [[satire]] and [[criticism]] of modern Indonesian society. From a political, social, cultural and current point of view, Indonesia is described as the '[[reincarnation]]' of the Majapahit empire. The current Indonesian president is often portrayed as a Majapahit monarch or prime minister.\n# ''Saur Sepuh'' (1987\u20131991), a radio drama and film by Niki Kosasih. Begun as a popular radio drama program in the late 1980s, Saur Sepuh is based on 15th-century Java, centred around the story about a fictional hero named Brama Kumbara, the king of Madangkara, a fictional kingdom neighbour of the [[Kingdom of Sunda|Pajajaran]]. In several stories the Paregreg war is described, that is to say the civil war of Majapahit between Wikramawardhana and Bhre Wirabhumi. This part has been made into a single feature film entitled 'Saur Sepuh' as well.\n# ''Tutur Tinular'', a radio drama and film by S Tidjab. Tutur Tinular is a [[martial art]] historical epic fictional story with the Majapahit era serving as the background of the story. The story also involved a romance between the hero named Arya Kamandanu and his Chinese lover Mei Shin.\n# ''Wali Songo'', the film tells the story of nine [[Muslim]] saints ('wali') who spread [[Islam]] to Java. The story took place near the end of the Majapahit era and the formation of [[Demak Sultanate|Demak]]. It describes the decaying Majapahit empire where royals are fighting each other for power while the commoners suffer.\n# ''Senopati Pamungkas'' (1986, reprinted in 2003), a martial art-historical epic novel by Arswendo Atmowiloto. It takes place in the late Singhasari period and formation of Majapahit. This novel describes the sagas, royal intrigues, and romance of the formation of the kingdom as well as the adventure of the main character, a commoner named Upasara Wulung and his forbidden love affair with princess Gayatri Rajapatni, whom later becomes the consort of [[Raden Wijaya]], the first king of Majapahit.\n#  ''Imperium Majapahit'', a comic book series by Jan Mintaraga, published by Elexmedia Komputindo. This series tells the history of Majapahit from its formation until the decline.\n# ''[[Puteri Gunung Ledang (film)|Puteri Gunung Ledang]]'' (2004), a [[Malaysia]]n epic film based on [[Legend of Puteri Gunung Ledang|a traditional Malay legend]]. This film recounts the love story between Gusti Putri Retno Dumilah, a Majapahit princess, and [[Hang Tuah]], a [[Malaccan Sultanate|Malaccan]] admiral.\n# ''[[Gajah Mada (book)|Gajah Mada]]'', a [[pentalogy]] written by [[Langit Kresna Hariadi]] depicting a fictionalised detail of [[Gajah Mada]]'s life from the [[Gajah Mada#Rise to Mahapatih|Kuti rebellion]] up to the [[Gajah Mada#The Bubat Accident|Bubat War]].\n# ''[[Dyah Pitaloka]]'' (2007), a novel written by Hermawan Aksan, fictionalising the detailed life story of Sundanese princess [[Dyah Pitaloka Citraresmi]] set around the [[Gajah Mada#The Bubat Accident|Bubat War]]. The novel virtually takes the same context and was inspired by the [[Kidung Sundayana]].\n# ''Jung Jawa'' (2009), an anthology of short stories written by Rendra Fatrisna Kurniawan, imagining the life of the Nusantara people, published by Babel Publishing.\n# ''[[Civilization 5: Brave New World]] (2013)'', where [[Gajah Mada]] appeared as one of the leaders of a great civilisation in the second expansion of the [[Civilization 5]] game. He is the leader of the Indonesian civilisation, with the emblem of the Indonesian empire being the [[Surya Majapahit]], although in the game the empire is known as the \"Indonesian empire\" instead.\n# Later, in [[Civilization VI|''Civilization 6 (2016),'']] ''a'' downloadable content has one of its rulers, [[Tribhuwana Wijayatunggadewi|Dyah Gitarja]] (referred as Gitarja in-game) as the leader of the Indonesian civilization, with the emblem being a simpler version of the Surya Majapahit. The unique unit of Indonesian civilization is the ''jong''.\n# On the ''Rise of the Rajas'' expansion pack from ''[[Age of Empires II]]'', [[Gajah Mada]] appears in a campaign detailing his rise and then fall after the Pasunda Bubat tragedy.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Indonesia}}\n{{div col}}\n* [[Gosari inscription]]\n* [[Kidung Sunda]]\n* [[List of monarchs of Java]]\n* [[Osing people|Osing]]\n* [[Srivijaya]]\n* [[Tenggerese people|Tenggerese]]\n* [[Hinduism in Indonesia]]\n{{col div end}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist | group=lower-roman | close}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em|refs=\n<ref name=miksic>{{Cite book\n| isbn      = 9813018267\n| series    = Indonesian Heritage Series\n| title     = Ancient History\n| publisher = Archipelago Press / Editions Didier Millet\n| year      = 1999\n| editor    = John Miksic\n| volume    = Vol 1\n}}</ref>\n<ref name=ricklefs>{{Cite book\n| isbn      = 9780804721950\n| last      = Ricklefs\n| first     = Merle Calvin\n| title     = A history of modern Indonesia since c. 1300\n| year      = 1993\n| publisher = Stanford University Press / Macmillans\n| edition   = 2nd\n}}</ref>\n<ref name=yingyai>{{Cite book\n| isbn      = 9780521010320\n| author    = Ma Huan\n| title     = [[Yingya Shenglan|Ying-yai Sheng-lan]] (\u701b\u6daf\u80dc\u89c8) The Overall Survey of the Ocean's Shores\n| others    = translated by J.V.G Mills\n| language  = Chinese\n| origyear  = 1433\n| year      = 1970\n| publisher = Cambridge University Press\n| series    = [[Hakluyt Society]]\n}}</ref>\n}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Majapahit}}\n{{div col}}\n* [http://www.eastjava.com/books/trowulan/history/history.html A Short History of Majapahit]\n* [http://www.eastjava.com/books/majapahit/ Memoirs of Majapahit Kingdom]\n* [http://users.skynet.be/network.indonesia/ni4001c6.htm A brief history of Majapahit]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20120125090000/http://sejarahnasional.org/index.php/kerajaan-nusantara/1-terjemahan-manuskrip-nagarakertagama A Complete Transcription of Majapahit Royal Manuscript of Nagarakertagama from SejarahNasional.org an National History Website]\n{{col div end}}\n\n{{Precolonial states in Indonesia}}\n{{Asia in topic|Hinduism in}}\n{{Empires}}\n{{Coord missing|Indonesia}}\n\n[[Category:1527 disestablishments in Asia]]\n[[Category:States and territories established in 1293]]\n[[Category:States and territories disestablished in 1527]]\n[[Category:Historical Hindu empires]]\n[[Category:Precolonial states of Indonesia]]\n[[Category:1293 establishments in Asia]]\n[[Category:Former countries in Malaysian history]]\n[[Category:Majapahit]]\n[[Category:Former empires in Asia]]\n[[Category:Former countries in Indonesian history]]\n[[Category:Hindu Buddhist states in Indonesia]]\n[[Category:Island countries]]\n[[Category:Indianized kingdoms]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Empire based on the island of Java from 1293 to around 1500}}\n{{EngvarB|date=September 2015}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=January 2020}}\n{{Infobox country\n|conventional_long_name = Majapahit Empire\n|common_name            = Majapahit Empire\n|native_name            = \ua9a4\ua992\ua9ab\ua9b6\ua98f\ua9ab\ua997\ua9a4\ua9c0\ua9a9\ua997\ua9a5\ua9bb\ua9a0\ua9c0 {{small|([[Bahasa Jawa|Jawa]])}}<br>\u1b27\u1b44\u1b2d\u1b1a\u1b2b\u1b1a\u1b27\u1b33\u1b36\u1b22\u1b44 {{small|([[Basa Bali|Bali]])}}<br>''\u1b8a\u1b9b\u1b8f\u1b83\u1b94\u1baa\u1b99\u1b8f\u1b95\u1ba0\u1ba4\u1b92\u1baa'' {{small|([[Bahasa Sunda|Sunda]])}}\n|religion               = [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]], [[Kebatinan|Kejawen]], [[Animism]]\n|p1                     = Singhasari\n|s1                     = Demak Sultanate\n|s2                     = Bali Kingdom\n|year_start             = 1293\n|year_end               = 1527\n|date_start             = 10 November<ref name=\"NGI Trowulan\">{{cite web|title = 10 November, Hari Berdirinya Majapahit | author = Mahandis Y.

He also took a [[Sumatra]]n Malay [[Dharmasraya]] princess named [[Dara Petak]] as his wife.\n\nThe new kingdom faced challenges. Some of Kertarajasa's most trusted men, including [[Ranggalawe]], Sora, and Nambi were rebelled against him, though unsuccessfully. It was suspected that the ''Mahapati'' (a title equal to prime minister) [[Mahapati Halayudha|Halayudha]] set the conspiracy to overthrow all of his rivals in the court, led them to revolt against the king, while he himself gained king's favour and attained the highest position in the government.

The reign of Jayanegara was a difficult and chaotic one, troubled with several rebellions by his father's former companions in arms. Among others are Gajah Biru's rebellion in 1314 and the Kuti rebellion in 1319. The Kuti rebellion was the most dangerous one, as Kuti managed to take control of the capital city. With the help of [[Gajah Mada]] and his ''Bhayangkara'' palace guard,<ref name=Coedes/>{{rp|233}} Jayanegara barely escaped from the capital and safely hid in Badander village. While the king was in hiding, Gajah Mada returned to the capital city to assess the situation. After learning that Kuti's rebellion was not supported by the people or nobles of Majapahit court, Gajah Mada raised resistance forces to crush the Kuti rebellion.\n\nAfter Kuti forces were defeated, Jayanegara was safely returned to his throne.

One of his distasteful acts was his desire to take his own half sisters, Gitarja and Rajadewi, as wives. Since Javanese tradition abhorred the practice of half siblings marrying, the council of royal elders spoke strongly against the king's wishes. It was not clear what motivated Jayanegara's wish \u2013 it might have been his way to ensure his claim to the throne by preventing rivals from being his half sisters' suitors, although in the later period of the Majapahit court the custom of marriage among cousins was quite common. In the ''[[Pararaton]]'', he was known as ''Kala Gemet'', or \"weak villain\". About the time of Jayanegara's reign, the Italian Friar [[Odoric of Pordenone]] visited the Majapahit court in Java.\n\nIn 1328, Jayanegara was murdered by his physician, Tanca, during a surgical operation. In complete mayhem and rage, Gajah Mada immediately killed Tanca. The motive behind this [[regicide]] was never clear. According to the ''Pararaton'', it was Tanca's revenge for the king sexually abusing his wife. However, according to the Balinese manuscript ''[[Babad Dalem]]'', the assassination was a stratagem crafted by Gajah Mada himself in order to rid the kingdom of an evil tyrant.<ref name=\"Tirto-Gajah Mada\">{{Cite web|url=https://tirto.id/gajah-mada-dan-kontroversi-dalang-pembunuhan-raja-majapahit-cCRR|title=Gajah Mada dan Kontroversi Dalang Pembunuhan Raja Majapahit|last=Raditya|first=Iswara |website=tirto.id|language=id|access-date=29 July 2019}}</ref> Tradition mentions that the immoral, cruel and abusive king often seduced and abused women, even the wives of his own subordinates.<ref>{{cite news | title = Goda Istri Orang, Raja Jayanegara Dibunuh Tabib (Bagian-2) | author = Bahari | date = 12 September 2015 | work = Sindo | language = Indonesian | url = https://daerah.sindonews.com/read/1043588/29/goda-istri-orang-raja-jayanegara-dibunuh-tabib-bagian-2-1441971107/13}}</ref> Other possible reason includes to protect the two princesses \u2013 Gitarja and Rajadewi, the daughters of Gayatri Rajapatni from the king's cruelty.<ref name=\"Tirto-Gajah Mada\"/> Since the slain king was childless, he left no successor.\n\n===Golden age===\n\n====Queen Tribhuwana Wijayatunggadewi====\n[[File:Parvati Majapahit 2.JPG|thumb|left|upright|The statue of [[Parvati]] as mortuary deified portrayal of [[Tribhuwana Wijayatunggadewi|Tribhuwanottunggadewi]], queen of Majapahit, mother of [[Hayam Wuruk]].]] \nJayanegara's stepmother, Gayatri Rajapatni \u2013 the most revered matriarch of the court \u2013 was supposed to take the helm.

After seven months of battles, Majapahit forces defeated the Balinese king and captured the Balinese capital of Bedulu in 1343. After the conquest of Bali, Majapahit distributed the governing authority of Bali among Arya Damar's younger brothers, Arya Kenceng, Arya Kutawandira, Arya Sentong, and Arya Belog. Arya Kenceng led his brothers to govern Bali under Majapahit suzerainty, and he would become the progenitor of the Balinese kings of the Tabanan and Badung royal houses. Through this campaign, Majapahit planted a vassal dynasty that would rule the [[Bali Kingdom]] in the following centuries. Tribhuwana ruled Majapahit until the death of her mother in 1350. She abdicated the throne in favour of her son, Hayam Wuruk.\n\n====Reign of Hayam Wuruk and Gajah Mada's conquest====\n[[File:Majapahit Expansion.gif|thumb|260px|Expansion of the Majapahit Empire started in Trowulan Majapahit in the 13th century and extended to much of the Indonesian archipelago until it receded and fell in the early 16th century.]]\n[[Hayam Wuruk]], also known as Rajasanagara, ruled Majapahit in 1350\u201389.

However, perhaps the most significant Chinese intervention was its support for the newly established [[Sultanate of Malacca]], as a rival and counter-weight to the Majapahit influence of Java.<ref name=\"TOI-Sanyal\" /> \n\nPreviously, Majapahit has succeeded to assert its influence in Malacca strait by containing the aspiration of Malay polities in Sumatra and Malay Peninsula to ever reach the geopolitical might like those of Srivijaya. The Hindu Majapahit were the most powerful maritime power in Southeast Asian seas that time and were opposed to Chinese expansion into their sphere of influence. The Ming's support for Malacca, and the spread of Islam propagated by both Malacca and Zheng He's treasure fleet has weakened Majapahit maritime influence in Sumatra, which caused the northern part of the island to increasingly converting to Islam and gained independence from Majapahit, leaving [[Indragiri]], [[Jambi]] and [[Palembang]], remnants of the old [[Srivijaya]], the only suzerainty under Majapahit in Sumatra,{{efn | group=lower-roman | According to the History of Ming, only these areas in Sumatra were still mentioned as under Javanese / Majapahit supremacy at the time. Read <ref name=\"notes on the malay archipelago\" />}} bordering [[Pagaruyung Kingdom]] on the west and independent Muslim kingdoms on the north.\n\nThis Ming dynasty voyages is extremely important for Majapahit historiography, since Zheng He's translator [[Ma Huan]] wrote ''[[Yingya Shenglan]]'', a detailed description of Majapahit,<ref name=\"yingyai\" /> which provides a valuable insight on the culture, customs, also various social and economic aspects of Java during Majapahit period.<ref name=\"Chao-Wa\" />\n\nThe Chinese provided systematic support to Malacca, and its sultan made at least one trip to personally pay obeisance to the Ming emperor. Malacca actively encouraged the conversion to [[Islam]] in the region, while Ming fleet actively established Chinese-Malay Muslim community in coastal northern Java, thus created a permanent opposition to the Hindus of Java. By 1430, the expeditions had established Muslim Chinese, Arab and Malay communities in northern ports of Java such as [[Semarang]], [[Demak, Indonesia|Demak]], [[Tuban]], and [[Surabaya|Ampel]]; thus Islam began to gain a foothold on the northern coast of Java. Malacca prospered under Chinese Ming protection, while the Majapahit were steadily pushed back.<ref name=\"TOI-Sanyal\" />\n\n====Queen Suhita====\n[[File:Suhita.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The mortuary deified portrait statue of Queen [[Suhita]] (reign 1429-1447), discovered at Jebuk, Kalangbret, Tulungagung, East Java, [[National Museum of Indonesia]].]]\nWikramawardhana ruled until 1426 and was succeeded by his daughter [[Suhita]],<ref name=\"Coedes\" />{{rp|242}} who ruled from 1426 to 1447. She was the second child of Wikramawardhana by a concubine who was the daughter of Wirabhumi. The reign of Suhita was the second time Majapahit was reigned by a queen regnant after her great grandmother Tribhuwana Wijayatunggadewi. Her reign is immortalized in Javanese legend of [[Damarwulan]], as it involves a maiden queen named Prabu Kenya in the story, and during Suhita's reign there was a war with [[Blambangan]] as stated in the legend.<ref>Claire Holt. ''Art in Indonesia: Continuities and Change''.

After Kertawijaya died, [[Bhre Pamotan]] became a king with formal name Rajasawardhana. He died in 1453. A three-year kingless period was possibly the result of a succession crisis. [[Girisawardhana]], son of Kertawijaya, came to power in 1456. He died in 1466 and was succeeded by Singhawikramawardhana.\n\n====The divide====\nIn 1468 Prince Kertabhumi rebelled against Singhawikramawardhana, promoting himself as the king of Majapahit. Deposed Singhawikramawardhana retreated upstream of Brantas River, moved the kingdom's capital further inland to [[Kediri (city)|Daha]] (the former capital of [[Kediri (historical kingdom)|Kediri kingdom]]), effectively splitting Majapahit, under Bhre Kertabumi in Trowulan and Singhawikramawardhana in Daha. Singhawikramawardhana continued his rule until he was succeeded by his son [[Girindrawardhana]] (Ranawijaya) in 1474.\n\nAnd in between this period of the dividing court of Majapahit, the kingdom found itself unable to control its western part of the already crumbling empire. The rising power of the [[Sultanate of Malacca]] began to gain effective control of [[Strait of Malacca|Malacca Strait]] in the mid-15th century and expanding its influence to Sumatra. And amidst these events, Indragiri and Siantan, according to [[Malay Annals]] were given to Malacca as a dowry for the marriage of a Majapahit princess and the [[Mansur Shah of Malacca|sultan of Malacca]].<ref name=\"Leyden\">Leyden, John (1821)[https://books.google.co.id/books?id=J9JAAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q&f=false Malay Annals (translated from the Malay language)], Longman, Hurst, Rees, Orme and Brown.</ref>, further weakening Majapahit's influence on the western part of the archipelago. Kertabhumi managed to stabilized this situation by allying with Muslim merchants, giving them trading rights on the north coast of Java, with [[Demak Regency|Demak]] as its centre and in return asked for their loyalty to Majapahit. This policy boosted the Majapahit treasury and power, but weakened Hindu-Buddhism as its main religion because [[Dawah|Islamic proselytizing]] spread faster, especially in Javanese coastal principalities. Hindu-Buddhist followers' grievances later paved the way for Ranawijaya to defeat Kertabumi.\n\n[[Image:Muzium Negara KL38.JPG|thumb|right|The model of a Majapahit ship display in [[Muzium Negara]], [[Kuala Lumpur]].

This event led to the war between the [[Sultanate of Demak]] and [[Kediri (historical kingdom)|Daha]], since Demak rulers were descendants of Kertabhumi.\n\nDuring this period of Majapahit's retreat to the inland [[Kediri|Daha]] and war in Java, [[Demak Sultanate|Demak]], being the dominant ruler of the Javanese coastal lands and Java as a whole, seized the region of Jambi and Palembang in Sumatra from Majapahit.<ref name=\":3\" />{{rp|154\u2013155}}\n\n====Demak invasion and the fall of Majapahit====\n[[File:Masjid Agung Demak.jpg|thumb|left|[[Demak Sultanate|Demak]] was the earliest Islamic polity in Java that replaced Majapahit.]]\nIn 1498, there was a turning point when Girindrawardhana was deposed by his vice regent, Udara. After this coup, the war between Demak and Daha receded, with some sources saying [[Raden Patah]], Sultan of Demak, left Majapahit alone as his father had done before, while others said Udara agreed to become a vassal of Demak, even marrying Raden Patah's youngest daughter.\n\nMeanwhile in the west, [[Capture of Malacca (1511)|Malacca was captured by Portuguese in 1511]].

The refugees fled to the east to avoid Demak retribution for their support for Ranawijaya against Kertabhumi. \n\nDemak came under the leadership of Raden (later crowned as Sultan) Patah (Arabic name: Fatah, lit. \"liberator\", \"conqueror\"), who was acknowledged as the legitimate successor of Majapahit. According to Babad Tanah Jawi and Demak tradition, the source of Patah's legitimacy was because their first sultan, Raden Patah, was the son of Majapahit king Brawijaya V with a Chinese concubine. Another argument supports Demak as the successor of Majapahit; the rising Demak sultanate was easily accepted as the nominal regional ruler, as Demak was the former Majapahit vassal and located near the former Majapahit realm in Eastern Java.\n\nDemak established itself as the regional power and the first Islamic sultanate in Java. After the fall of Majapahit, the Hindu kingdoms in Java only remained in [[Blambangan]] on the eastern edge and [[Sunda Kingdom|Pajajaran]] in the western part. Gradually [[Hindu]] communities began to retreat to the mountain ranges in East Java and also to the neighbouring island of [[Bali]]. A small enclave of [[Tenggerese people|Hindu communities]] still remain in the [[Tengger caldera|Tengger]] mountain range.\n\n== Military ==\nAccording to History of Yuan, soldiers of early Majapahit era were mainly dominated by poorly equipped light [[infantry]]. During the Mongol invasion of Java, Javanese army was described as temporarily mobilized farmers and a few noble warriors. The nobility marched at the front line, with huge rear army composed of peasants. The Javanese peasant army was half-naked and covered with cotton fabric at the waist ([[sarung]]). Most of the weapons are bows and arrows, [[bamboo]] spears, and short blades.

The Javanese lords are so noble and exalted that there is no nation to compare with them over a wide area in these parts.

For the writing, they had known the alphabet using ''So-li'' (Chola - Coromandel/Southern India) letters. There is no paper or pen, they use ''Chiao-chang'' (''kajang'') or palm leaf (''[[Palm-leaf manuscript#Javanese and Balinese|lontar]]''), written by scraping it with a sharp knife.

Unlike the earlier naturalistic, relaxed and flowing figures of classical Central Java style ([[Sailendra]] art c. 8th to 10th century), this East Javanese style demonstrates a stiffer pose, stylised and rendered in [[wayang]]-like figures, such as those carved on East Javanese temple's bas-reliefs. The bas-reliefs were projected rather flat from the background. This style was later preserved in [[Balinese art]], especially in its [[Kamasan]] style classical paintings and Balinese wayang.\n\nThe statues of Hindu gods and Buddhist deities in Majapahit art were also the continuisation of its previous Singhasari art. The statues of East Javanese period tends to be stiffer and frontal-formal pose, compared to the statues of Central Javanese art (c. 9th century) that are more Indianized style, relaxed in [[tribhanga]] pose. The stiffer pose of Majapahit gods statues are probably in accordance to the statue's function as the deified portrayal self of the dead Majapahit monarch. The carving however, are richly decorated, especially with fine floral carving of lotus plants carved on the stela behind the statue. Examples of Majapahit statues are the Harihara statue from Simping temple, believed to be the deified portrayal of [[Raden Wijaya|King Kertarajasa]], the statue of Parwati believed to be the portrayal of [[Tribhuwana Wijayatunggadewi|Queen Tribhuwana]], and statue of queen [[Suhita]] discovered at Jebuk, Kalangbret, Tulungagung, East Java.\n\n[[File:Pair of door guardians SF Asian Art Museum.JPG|thumb|left|Pair of door guardians from a temple, Eastern Java, 14th century, [[Asian Art Museum of San Francisco|Museum of Asian Art, San Francisco]].]]\n\nClay pottery and brick masonry are popular feature in Majapahit art and architecture. The [[Majapahit Terracotta]] art also flourished in this period. Significant numbers of [[terracotta]] artefacts were discovered in [[Trowulan]]. The artefacts ranges from human and animal figurines, jars, vessels, water containers, [[piggy bank]]s, bas reliefs, architectural ornaments, roof pinnacles, floor tiles, to pipes and roof tiles. One of the most interesting findings is Majapahit piggy bank. Several boar-shaped piggy banks has been discovered in Trowulan. It is probably the origin of Javanese-Indonesian word to refer for saving or money container. The word ''celengan'' in [[Javanese language|Javanese]] and [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]] means both \"savings\" and \"piggy bank\". It was derived from the word ''celeng'' which means \"wild boar\", the [[suffix]] \"-an\" was added to denote its likeness. One important specimen is stored in National Museum of Indonesia, it has been reconstructed since this large piggy bank has been found broken to pieces.\n\nTerracotta money boxes also has been found in different shapes, such as tubular or boxes, with slits to slip coins. Another important terracotta artefact is the head figurine of a man popularly thought to be the depiction of Gajah Mada, although it is not certain about who was depicted in these figurines.\n\n===Architecture===\n{{further|Candi of Indonesia}}\n[[File:Candi Jabung B.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Jabung]] temple near Paiton, Probolinggo, East Java, dated from Majapahit period.]]\n\nIn his book ''Yingya Shenglan'', Ma Huan also describes the Majapahit cities: most of them do not have walls surrounding the city or the suburbs. He describes the king's palace in Majapahit. The king's residence is surrounded with thick red brick walls more than three ''[[zhang (unit)|chang]]'' high (about {{convert|30.5|ft|m|abbr=off|disp=or}}), with length of more than 200 paces ({{convert|340|yd|m|abbr=off|disp=or}}) and on the wall there are two layers of gates, the palace is very well guarded and clean. The king's palace was a two-storey building, each of them 3 or 4 ''chang'' high ({{convert|9\u201314.5|m|abbr=off|disp=or}}). It had wooden plank floors and exposed mats made from rattan or reeds (presumably palm leaves), where people sat cross-legged. The roof was made of hardwood shingles (Javanese:''sirap'') laid as tiles.<ref name=yingyai />\n\nThe houses of commoners had thatched roofs ([[nipa palm]] leaves). Every family has a storage shed made of bricks, about 3 or 4 ''[[Chi (unit)|Ch'ih]]'' ({{convert|48.9|in|cm|abbr=off|disp=or}}) above the ground, where they kept the family property, and they lived on top of this building, to sit and sleep.\n\nThe Majapahit temple architecture follows the east Javanese styles, in contrast of earlier central Javanese style. This east Javanese temple style is also dated back from Kediri period c. 11th century. The shapes of Majapahit temples are tends to be slender and tall, with roof constructed from multiple parts of stepped sections formed a combined roof structure curved upward smoothly creating the [[Perspective (visual)|perspective illussion]] that the temple is perceived taller than its actual height. The pinnacle of the temples are usually cube (mostly Hindu temples), sometimes dagoba cylindrical structures (Buddhist temples). Although some of temples dated from Majapahit period used [[andesite]] or [[sandstone]], the red [[brick]]s is also a popular construction material.\n\n[[File:Bajang Ratu Gate Trowulan.jpg|left|upright|thumb|The 16.5-metre tall Bajang Ratu [[Paduraksa]] gate, at Trowulan, echoed the grandeur of Majapahit.]]\n\nAlthough [[brick]] had been used in the ''[[Candi of Indonesia|candi]]'' of Indonesia's classical age, it was Majapahit architects of the 14th and 15th centuries who mastered it.<ref name=\"Schoppert1997\">{{cite book|author=Schoppert, P., Damais, S.|title=Java Style|year=1997|publisher=Periplus Editions|editor=Didier Millet|location=Paris|pages=33\u201334|isbn=962-593-232-1}}</ref> Making use of a vine sap and [[palm sugar]] mortar, their temples had a strong geometric quality. The example of Majapahit temples are Brahu temple in Trowulan, [[Pari Temple|Pari]] in Sidoarjo, [[Jabung]] in Probolinggo, and [[Candi Surawana|Surawana temple]] near Kediri. Jabung temple was mentioned in Nagarakretagama as Bajrajinaparamitapura, despite some parts of its roof and pinnacles are now missing, it is one of the most well-preserved Majapahit temple architecture. Another example include Gunung Gangsir temple near Pasuruan. Some of the temples are dated from earlier period but renovated and expanded during Majapahit era, such as [[Candi Penataran|Penataran]], the largest temple in East Java dated back to [[Kediri (historical kingdom)|Kediri]] era. This temple was identified in Nagarakretagama as Palah temple and reported being visited by King Hayam Wuruk during his royal tour across East Java. Another notable temple of Eastern Javanese style is [[Jawi temple]] in Pandaan \u2013 also visited by King Hayam Wuruk, the temple was mentioned in Nagarakretagama as Jajawa, and was dedicated as mortuary temple for his great grandfather, King Kertanegara of Singhasari.\n\nSome of typical architectural style are believed to be developed during Majapahit era; such as tall and slender roofed red brick gate commonly called as ''kori agung'' or ''[[paduraksa]]'', and also split gate of ''[[candi bentar]]''. The large split gate of Wringin Lawang located at Jatipasar, Trowulan, Mojokerto, East Java, is one of the oldest and the largest surviving ''candi bentar'' dated from Majapahit era. The ''candi bentar'' took shape of typical Majapahit temple structure \u2013 consists of three parts; foot, body and tall roof \u2013 evenly split into two mirroring structures to make a passage in the centre for people to walk through. This type of split gate has no doors and provides no real defensive purpose but narrowing the passage. It was probably only serve the ceremonial and aesthetic purpose, to create the sense of grandeur, before entering the next compound through tall roof ''paduraksa'' gate with enclosed door. The example of ''kori agung'' or ''paduraksa'' style gate is the elegant Bajang Ratu gate richly decorated with Kala demon, cyclops and also the bas-relief telling the story of Sri Tanjung. Those typical Majapahit architectural style has deeply influenced the Javanese and [[Balinese architecture]] of later period. The current prevalence of Majapahit style pendopo pavilion, candi bentar and paduraksa gates, was owed to the influence of Majapahit aesthetics on Javanese and Balinese architecture.<ref name=\"Made Wijaya\">{{cite book | title = Majapahit Style Vol.1 | author = Made Wijaya | publisher = Wijaya Words - a division of Yayasan Beringin Berapi| year = 2014 | isbn = 9786027136700| url = https://books.google.com/books/about/Majapahit_Style_Vol_1.html?id=J3GMBAAAQBAJ&redir_esc=y}}</ref>\n\nIn later period near the fall of Majapahit, the art and architecture of Majapahit witnessed the revival of indigenous native Austronesian [[megalithic architectural elements]], such as [[Candi Sukuh|Sukuh]] and [[Candi Cetho|Cetho]] temples on western slopes of [[Mount Lawu]]. Unlike previous Majapahit temples that demonstrate typical Hindu architecture of high-rise towering structure, the shape of these temples are [[step pyramid]], quite similar to Mesoamerican [[pyramid]]s. The stepped pyramid structure called ''Punden Berundak'' (stepped mounds) is a common megalithic structure during [[Prehistoric Indonesia|Indonesian prehistoric era]] before the adoption of Hindu-Buddhist culture.\n\n==Economy==\nAlso in ''Yingya Shenglan'', Ma Huan reported the Javanese economy and market.

''Mang-chi-shi'' \u2013 is something like a pomegranate, peel it like an orange, it has four lumps of white flesh, sweet and sour taste and very delicious. ''Lang-ch\u2019a'' is a fruit similar to Loquat, but larger, contained three blocky white flesh with sweet and sour taste.

Previously, the 9th-century [[Wonoboyo hoard]] discovered in Central Java shows that ancient Javan gold coins were seed-shaped, similar to corn, while the silver coins were similar to buttons. In about the year 1300, in the reign of Majapahit's first king, an important change took place: the indigenous coinage was completely replaced by imported Chinese copper cash. About 10,388 ancient Chinese coins weighing about 40&nbsp;kg were even unearthed from the backyard of a local commoner in [[Sidoarjo]] in November 2008. Indonesian Ancient Relics Conservation Bureau (BP3) of East Java verified that those coins dated as early as Majapahit era.<ref>{{cite web | title = Uang Kuno Temuan Rohimin Peninggalan Majapahit | url = http://www.kompas.com/read/xml/2008/11/24/17571290/uang.kuno.temuan.rohimin.peninggalan.majapahit. | date = November 2008 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131031003554/http://www.kompas.com/read/xml/2008/11/24/17571290/uang.kuno.temuan.rohimin.peninggalan.majapahit. | archivedate = 31 October 2013}}</ref> The reason for using foreign currency is not given in any source, but most scholars assume it was due to the increasing complexity of Javanese economy and a desire for a [[currency]] system that used much smaller denominations suitable for use in everyday market transactions. This was a role for which gold and silver are not well suited.<ref name=miksic />{{rp | page=107}} These ''kepeng'' Chinese coins were thin rounded copper coins with a square hole in the centre of it. The hole was meant to tie together the money in a string of coins. These small changes\u2014the imported Chinese copper coins\u2014enabled Majapahit further invention, a method of savings by using a slitted earthenware coin containers. These are commonly found in Majapahit ruins, the slit is the small opening to put the coins in. The most popular shape is boar-shaped ''celengan'' (piggy bank).\n\nSome idea of scale of the internal economy can be gathered from scattered data in inscriptions. The Canggu inscriptions dated 1358 mentions 78 ferry crossings in the country (mandala Java).<ref name=miksic />{{rp | page=107}} Majapahit inscriptions mention a large number of occupational specialities, ranging from gold and silver smiths to drink vendors and butchers. Although many of these occupations had existed in earlier times, the proportion of the population earning an income from non-agrarian pursuits seems to have become even greater during the Majapahit era.\n\nThe great prosperity of Majapahit was probably due to two factors. Firstly, the northeast lowlands of Java were suitable for rice [[Tillage|cultivation]], and during Majapahit's prime numerous [[irrigation]] projects were undertaken, some with government assistance. Secondly, Majapahit's ports on the north coast were probably significant stations along the route to obtain the spices of [[Maluku Islands|Maluku]], and as the spices passed through Java they would have provided an important source of income for Majapahit.<ref name=miksic />{{rp|page=107}}\n\nThe Nagarakretagama states that the fame of the ruler of Wilwatikta (a synonym for Majapahit) attracted foreign merchants from far and wide, including Indians, Khmers, Siamese, and Chinese among others. While in later period, ''Yingya Shenglan'' mentioned that large numbers of Chinese traders and Muslim merchants from west (from Arab and India, but mostly from Muslim states in Sumatra and Malay peninsula) are settling in Majapahit port cities, such as Tuban, Gresik and Hujung Galuh ([[Surabaya]]). A special tax was levied against some foreigners, possibly those who had taken up semi-permanent residence in Java and conducted some type of enterprise other than foreign trade. The Majapahit Empire had trading links with Chinese [[Ming dynasty]], [[Vietnam|Annam]] and [[Champa]] in today Vietnam, [[Cambodia]], Siamese [[Ayutthaya Kingdom|Ayutthayan]], Burmese [[Martaban]] and the south Indian [[Vijayanagara Empire]].\n\n==Administration==\n{{multiple image|align=right| direction = vertical|total_width=150|image1=Surya Majapahit.jpg|image2=Surya Majapahit 2.jpg|image3=Candi Ceto Majapahit Sun, Surakarta 1264.jpg|footer=Three designs of [[Surya Majapahit]], the sun emblem of the kingdom.}}\n\nDuring the reign of [[Hayam Wuruk]], Majapahit employed a well-organised bureaucratic structure for administrative purposes.

The king holds the highest political authority and legitimacy.\n\n===Bureaucracy officials===\nDuring his daily administration, the king is assisted by bureaucratic state officials that also included the close relatives of the kings that hold certain esteemed titles. The royal order or edict usually transmitted from the king to the high officials well to their subordinates. The officials in Majapahit courts are:\n:* ''Rakryan Mahamantri Katrini'', usually reserved for the king's heir\n:* ''Rakryan Mantri ri Pakira-kiran'', the board of [[Minister (government)|ministers]] that conduct the daily administration\n:* ''Dharmmadhyaksa'', the officials of laws, state laws as well as religious laws\n:* ''Dharmma-upapatti'', the officials concerning religious affairs\n\nWithin the ministers of ''Rakryan Mantri ri Pakira-kiran'' there is the most important and the highest minister titled ''Rakryan Mapatih'' or ''Patih Hamangkubhumi''. This position is analogous to [[prime minister]], and together with king, they determine the important state policies, including war or peace. Among the Dharmmadhyaksa officials there is ''Dharmmadhyaksa ring Kasewan'' (State's highest Hindu [[Shivaist]] priest) and ''Dharmmadhyaksa ring Kasogatan'' (State's highest Buddhist priest), both are the religious laws authorities of each dharmic faiths.\n\nThere is also the board of advisors which consists of the elders within royal family called ''Bhattara Saptaprabhu''. This council consists of seven influential elders\u2014mostly directly related to the king. They are the ''Bhres'' (Duke or Duchess) acted as regional kings, the rulers of Majapahit provinces. This council congregates, offers advice, gave consideration to the king, and often formed an assembly to judge a certain important case in the court. Example of their office was, their sentence to temporarily suspend Mahamantri Gajah Mada, as a punishment since he was held responsible for the shamefully disastrous [[Battle of Bubat|Bubat incident]]. The council also sentenced the execution of Raden Gajah (Narapati) for decapitating Bhre Wirabhumi in [[Paregreg war]].<ref name=\"BP-Sejarah Nasional\">{{cite book | title = Sejarah nasional Indonesia: Zaman kuno \u2013 Volume 2 dari Sejarah nasional Indonesia | author1= Marwati Djoened Poesponegoro | author2= Soejono (R.

The traditional or initial area of Majapahit during its formation before entering the imperial phase. This includes the capital city and the surrounding areas where the king effectively exercises his government. The area in and around royal capital of [[Trowulan]], port of Canggu and sections of [[Brantas River]] valley near the capital, also mountainous areas south and southeast of capital, all the way to [[Mount Penanggungan|Pananggungan]] and [[Arjuno-Welirang]] peaks, are the core realm of the kingdom. The Brantas river valley corridor, connecting Majapahit Trowulan area to Canggu and estuarine areas in Kahuripan (Sidoarjo) and [[Janggala|Hujung Galuh]] port (Surabaya) are considered as parts of ''Negara Agung''.\n* '''''Mancanegara''''', areas surrounding ''Negara Agung'' \u2014 traditionally refer to Majapahit provinces in East and Central Java. This area covered the eastern half of Java, with all its provinces ruled by the ''Bhres'' (dukes), the king's close relatives. These areas are directly influenced by Javanese Majapahit court culture, and obliged to pay annual tributes. These areas usually possess their own rulers that might be directly related, foster an alliance or intermarried with the Majapahit royal family. Majapahit stationed their officials and officers in these places and regulate their foreign trade activities and collect taxes, yet they enjoyed substantial internal autonomy. This includes the rest of [[Java]] island, [[Madura]] and [[Bali]]. However, in later period, overseas provinces which has developed culture reflected or comparable to those of Java, or possess significant trading importance, are also considered as ''mancanegara''. Either the province has their own native rulers subject (vassal) to the king, or a regent appointed and sent by the king to rule the region. This realm includes [[Melayu Kingdom|Dharmasraya]], [[Pagaruyung Kingdom|Pagaruyung]], [[Lampung]] and [[Palembang]] in [[Sumatra]].\n* '''''Nusantara''''', areas which do not reflect Javanese culture, but are included as colonies and they had to pay annual tribute. They had their native polity intact, enjoyed substantial autonomy and internal freedom, and Majapahit did not necessarily station their officials or military officers here; however, any challenges on Majapahit oversight might draw severe response. These areas such as the vassal kingdoms and colonies in [[Malay peninsula]], [[Borneo]], [[Lesser Sunda Islands]], [[Sulawesi]] and [[Maluku Islands|Maluku]].\n[[File:Filippine, provincia di agusan, immagine hindu, statuetta in oro massiccio, xiii secolo.jpg|left|thumb|upright|A 1.79 kilogram, 21-karat Majapahit period [[Golden Tara|gold image]] discovered in [[Esperanza, Agusan|Agusan]], [[Philippines]], copied Nganjuk bronze images of the early Majapahit period,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://digitalcollections.universiteitleiden.nl/view/item/7096|title=[Bronze statues from Nganjuk] OD-3577 {{!}} Digital Collections|website=digitalcollections.universiteitleiden.nl|access-date=2020-03-15}}</ref> signify Majapahit cultural influence on southern Philippines.]]\n\n[[Nagarakretagama#Descriptions of the Majapahit realm|Nagarakretagama]] mentioned more than 80 places in the archipelago described as the vassal states.<ref name=\"Britannica-Majapahit\"/> In Canto 13, several lands on [[Sumatra]] are mentioned, and some possibly correspond to contemporary areas: [[Jambi]], [[Palembang]], Teba ([[Toba Samosir Regency|Toba]]), and [[Dharmasraya]].

According to [[Waringin Pitu inscription]] (dated 1447) it was mentioned that Majapahit's core realm was consisted of 14 provinces, that administrated by the ruler titled ''Bhre''.<ref>Nastiti, Titi Surti.

Since early of its formation, Majapahit inherited the foreign outlook of its predecessor entity \u2013 [[Singhasari]] kingdom, in which its last king [[Kertanegara]] projected his influence abroad by launching [[Pamalayu]] expedition (1275-1293) to incorporate Malay polities in Sumatra and Malay Peninsula within Javanese sphere of influence. Previously, Singhasari seeks to dominate trade route, especially Malacca strait, and also saw the outreach of Mongolian-Chinese Yuan influence into Southeast Asia as the threat to their own realm.\n\nDuring its formation, the returning Pamalayu expedition in 1293 has brought Malayu Kingdoms in Jambi and Dharmasraya under Javanese suzerainty. Therefore, Java often seen itself as the overlord of most of polities in the Indonesian archipelago. In Sumatran front, Majapahit did capture Palembang, Jambi and Dharmasraya, invade [[Samudera Pasai Sultanate|Pasai]], and it also saw the settlement of [[Temasek|Tumasik]], that later become [[Kingdom of Singapura]], as its rebellious colony, and thus deal with them accordingly.\n\nDuring the reign of Majapahit's first two monarch \u2013 Wijaya and Jayanegara, the kingdom struggled to consolidate its rule, plagued by a number of rebellions. However, it was not until the reign of its third monarch \u2013 Queen Tribhuwana Tunggadewi, and her son, Hayam Wuruk \u2013 that the kingdom began to projected its power overseas. Majapahit's confidence for dominance was stemmed for their economic and demographic comparative advantage; agrarian as well as maritime nation; their large rice production, immense human resources, well-organized society, also their mastery in shipbuilding, navigation and military technology; are excellent relatively compared to their neighbours. These strengths were used by Gajah Mada to expand the kingdom's influence and building a maritime empire. This rather imperialistic outlooks, has projected in the way he forcefully dealt with Majapahit's neighbours; the Pabali (conquest of Bali, 1342\u20131343) and the [[Battle of Bubat|Pasunda Bubat]] (1356). Majapahit pulled Bali into their orbit as a vassal state. While the disastrous diplomacy with Sunda kingdom has led to the enmity among them.\n\nWithin Indonesian archipelago, Majapahit saw itself as the center of a huge mandala. This notion is demonstrated by its three tier administrative hierarchy; Nagara Agung, Mancanegara, and Nusantara. Outside of Maritime Southeast Asia, Majapahit devices Mitreka Satata, or partner in common order, in which it saw several states as ally. They are [[Ayutthaya Kingdom|Ayutthaya]], [[Nakhon Si Thammarat kingdom]], [[Ratchaburi]], [[Songkla]], [[Mottama]], [[Champa]], [[Cambodia]], and [[Vietnam|Annam]].\n\nIn later years after the era of Hayam Wuruk, Majapahit has lost their grips on some of their overseas possessions. This led to the thrive and the rise of several polities previously held under Majapahit domination, such as [[Bruneian Empire|Brunei]] and [[Malacca Sultanate|Malacca]]. The rise of Malacca in 15th century in particular is important, because it represents Majapahit eventual failure to control Malacca strait. Previously Majapahit tried to contain the rise of a potential regional rival; a Malay polity in par with Srivijaya, by punishing a rebellion in Palembang and capturing Singapura. In this sense, Malacca was indeed the rival of Majapahit in the competition to dominate the archipelagic realm. Despite this perceived rivalry, in practice however, the two kingdoms actually had some close and intense economic and cultural relations. At that time, the trade link between Majapahit ports of Hujung Galuh and Tuban with port of Melaka must be thriving.\n\nMajapahit true rival for domination however, was the powerful [[Ming Dynasty|Ming Chinese]]. After the fall of Yuan, the Ming Emperor eager to project his power into Southeast Asia. On the other hand Majapahit saw this archipelagic realm as theirs and unwelcome to any perceived Chinese interference. After Majapahit was weaken by Paregreg civil war, and incessant conflicts among its nobles, the arrival of the formidable [[Ming treasure voyages]] led by [[Zheng He]] upon Majapahit shores has pushed Majapahit prestigue and power to the side. Ming on the other hand, actively support the rise of Malacca. This Ming protection has made Majapahit unwilling and unable to push Malacca anymore. \n\nMajapahit true nemesis however, was located very close at home; the [[Demak Sultanate]] on northern coast of Central Java. Ming support to Malacca, and Malacca active proselytizing of Islam, has led to the thrive and rise of Muslim traders community in the archipelago, including in Majapahit ports on the north coast of Java. This in turn gradually corroded the prestigue of Javanese Hindu-Buddhist kingship, and after several generations, led to the fall of once mighty Majapahit empire.\n\n==Legacy==\n[[File:Pura Maospahit Denpasar Bali.jpg|thumb|right|''Pura Maospahit'' (\"Majapahit Temple\") in [[Denpasar]], Bali, demonstrate the typical Majapahit red brick architecture.]]\n\nMajapahit was the largest empire ever to form in Southeast Asia.<ref name=miksic />{{rp|page=107}} Although its political power beyond the core area in east Java was diffuse, constituting mainly ceremonial recognition of suzerainty, Majapahit society developed a high degree of sophistication in both commercial and artistic activities.

Other than Javanese sources, some regional legends mentioning Majapahit kingdom or its general Gajah Mada, also can be found; from Aceh, Minangkabau, Palembang, Malay Peninsula, Sunda, Brunei, Bali to Sumbawa. Most of them mentioned about the incoming Javanese forces to their land, which was probably a local testament of the empire's expansive nature that once dominating the archipelago. The [[Hikayat Raja-raja Pasai|Hikayat Raja Pasai]], a 14th-century [[Aceh]] chronicle tell a Majapahit naval invasion against [[Samudra Pasai]] in 1350. The chronicle described that the Majapahit invasion was a punishment for Sultan Ahmad Malik Az-Zahir's crime on ruining a royal marriage between Pasai Prince Tun Abdul Jalil and Raden Galuh Gemerencang, a Majapahit princess \u2013 that led to the death of the royal couple.<ref name=\"Tirto-Pasai\"/> \n[[File:Masjid Menara Kudus.jpg|thumb|left|The Majapahit style minaret of Kudus Mosque.]]\nIn West Sumatra, the [[Minangkabau (legend)|legend of Minangkabau]] mentioned an invading foreign prince \u2013 associated with Javanese Majapahit kingdom \u2013 being defeated in a buffalo fight.<ref name=\"Sindo-Minangkabau\"/> In West Java, the [[Battle of Bubat|Pasunda Bubat]] tragedy caused a myth to revolve around Indonesians, which forbids marriage between a [[Sundanese people|Sundanese]] and a [[Javanese people|Javanese]], as it would be unsustainable and only bring misery to the couple.<ref>{{cite news | title = Tragedi Perang Bubat dan mitos orang jawa dilarang kawin dengan sunda | date = 24 April 2015 | author = Hery H Winarno | url = https://www.merdeka.com/peristiwa/tragedi-perang-bubat-mitos-orang-jawa-dilarang-kawin-dengan-sunda.html | language = Indonesian}}</ref> In Malay peninsula, the [[Malay annals]] mentioned the legend of the fall of [[Kingdom of Singapura|Singapura]] to Majapahit forces in 1398 was due to the betrayal of Sang Rajuna Tapa that opened the fortified city gate.<ref>{{harvnb|A.

The [[Panji (prince)|Panji cycles]], the tale of [[Sri Tanjung]], and the epic of [[Damarwulan]], are popular tales in Javanese and [[Balinese literature]]s. The tales of Panji was dated from older period during Kediri kingdom, while the tale of Sri Tanjung and the epic of Damarwulan took place during Majapahit period. These tales remained a popular theme in Javanese culture of later period during Mataram Sultanate, and often became the source of inspiration for [[wayang]] shadow puppet performance, [[ketoprak]] and [[topeng]] dance drama. The Panji tales in particular have spread from East Java to become a source of inspiration for literature and dance drama throughout the region, as far as Malay peninsula, Cambodia and Siam where he is known as Raden Inao or Enau ({{lang-th|\u0e2d\u0e34\u0e40\u0e2b\u0e19\u0e32}}) of Kurepan.{{Sfn|Holt|1967|p=274}}\n\nMajapahit had a momentous and lasting influence on [[Indonesian art]] and [[Indonesian architecture|architecture]]. The empire's expansion circa 14th-century, contributed to the difussion Javanese cultural influence throughout the archipelago, which can be seen as a form of [[Javanisation]]. It was probably during this period that some of Javanese cultural elements, such as [[gamelan]]<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.thoughtco.com/history-of-gamelan-195131|title=Learn the History Behind Gamelan, Indonesian Music and Dance|work=ThoughtCo|access-date=13 November 2018}}</ref> and kris, being expanded and introduced to islands outside of Java.

The Majapahit architectural style that often employs [[Majapahit Terracotta|terracotta]] and [[red brick]] heavily influenced the architecture of Java and Bali in the later period. The Majapahit style ''[[candi bentar]]'' split gate, the ''kori'' or ''[[paduraksa]]'' towering red brick gate, and also ''pendopo'' pavilion have become ubiquitous in Javanese and Balinese architectural features, as seen in [[Menara Kudus Mosque]], [[Keraton Kasepuhan]] and Sunyaragi park in [[Cirebon]], [[Mataram Sultanate]] royal cemetery in [[Kota Gede]], [[Yogyakarta]], and various palaces and temples in Bali.<ref name=\"Made Wijaya\"/>\n\n[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Bas-reli\u00ebfs op het Pendopo Terras Panataran tempelcomplex TMnr 20027152.jpg|thumb|right|Bas relief from [[Candi Penataran]] describes the Javanese-style [[pendopo]] pavilion, commonly found across Java and Bali.]]\n\nThe vivid, rich and festive [[Balinese people#Culture|Balinese culture]] is considered as one of Majapahit legacy. The Javanese Hindu civilisation since the era of [[Airlangga]] to the era of Majapahit kings has profoundly influenced and shaped the Balinese culture and [[History of Bali|history]].<ref>[http://www.lonelyplanet.com/indonesia/bali/history Lonely Planet: History of Bali]</ref> The ancient links and Majapahit legacy is observable in many ways; architecture, literature, religious rituals, dance-drama and artforms. The aesthetics and style of bas-reliefs in Majapahit East Javanese temples were preserved and copied in Balinese temples. It is also due to the fact that after the fall of the empire, many Majapahit nobles, artisans and priests had taken refuge either in the interior mountainous region of East Java or across the narrow strait to Bali. Indeed, in some ways the [[Bali Kingdom|Kingdom of Bali]] was the successor of Majapahit. Large numbers of Majapahit manuscripts, such as [[Nagarakretagama]], [[Kakawin Sutasoma|Sutasoma]], [[Pararaton]] and [[Tantu Pagelaran]], were being well-kept in royal libraries of Bali and Lombok, and provides the glimpse and valuable historical records on Majapahit. The Majapahit Hindu-Javanese culture has shaped the culture of Bali, that led to popular expression; \"without Java there is no Bali\". Yet in return, Bali is credited as the last stronghold to safeguard and preserve the ancient Hindu Javanese civilisation.\n\n[[File:WLANL - mchangsp - Kris van Knaud.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Kris of Knaud]], one of the oldest surviving kris is dated to Majapahit period]]\n\nIn weaponry, the Majapahit expansion is believed to be responsible for the widespread use of the [[Kris|keris]] dagger in Southeast Asia; from Java, Bali, Sumatra, Malaysia, Brunei to Southern Thailand.

This ancient oath of unification signifies the Palapa satellite as the modern means to unify the Indonesian archipelago by way of [[telecommunication]].

The history of Majapahit continues to inspire contemporary artists.]]\nCelebrated as 'the golden era of the archipelago', the Majapahit empire has inspired many writers and artists (and continues to do so) to create their works based on this era, or to describe and mention it. The impact of the Majapahit theme on popular culture can be seen in the following:\n\n# ''Sandyakalaning Majapahit'' (1933), or Twilight/Sunset in Majapahit is an historical romance that took place during the fall of Majapahit empire, written by [[Sanusi Pane]].\n# ''Panji Koming'' (since 1979), a weekly [[comic strip]] by Dwi Koendoro published in the Sunday edition of [[Kompas]], telling the everyday life of Panji Koming, a common Majapahit citizen. Although it took place in the Majapahit era, the comic strip serves as witty [[satire]] and [[criticism]] of modern Indonesian society. From a political, social, cultural and current point of view, Indonesia is described as the '[[reincarnation]]' of the Majapahit empire. The current Indonesian president is often portrayed as a Majapahit monarch or prime minister.\n# ''Saur Sepuh'' (1987\u20131991), a radio drama and film by Niki Kosasih. Begun as a popular radio drama program in the late 1980s, Saur Sepuh is based on 15th-century Java, centred around the story about a fictional hero named Brama Kumbara, the king of Madangkara, a fictional kingdom neighbour of the [[Kingdom of Sunda|Pajajaran]]. In several stories the Paregreg war is described, that is to say the civil war of Majapahit between Wikramawardhana and Bhre Wirabhumi. This part has been made into a single feature film entitled 'Saur Sepuh' as well.\n# ''Tutur Tinular'', a radio drama and film by S Tidjab. Tutur Tinular is a [[martial art]] historical epic fictional story with the Majapahit era serving as the background of the story. The story also involved a romance between the hero named Arya Kamandanu and his Chinese lover Mei Shin.\n# ''Wali Songo'', the film tells the story of nine [[Muslim]] saints ('wali') who spread [[Islam]] to Java. The story took place near the end of the Majapahit era and the formation of [[Demak Sultanate|Demak]]. It describes the decaying Majapahit empire where royals are fighting each other for power while the commoners suffer.\n# ''Senopati Pamungkas'' (1986, reprinted in 2003), a martial art-historical epic novel by Arswendo Atmowiloto. It takes place in the late Singhasari period and formation of Majapahit. This novel describes the sagas, royal intrigues, and romance of the formation of the kingdom as well as the adventure of the main character, a commoner named Upasara Wulung and his forbidden love affair with princess Gayatri Rajapatni, whom later becomes the consort of [[Raden Wijaya]], the first king of Majapahit.\n#  ''Imperium Majapahit'', a comic book series by Jan Mintaraga, published by Elexmedia Komputindo. This series tells the history of Majapahit from its formation until the decline.\n# ''[[Puteri Gunung Ledang (film)|Puteri Gunung Ledang]]'' (2004), a [[Malaysia]]n epic film based on [[Legend of Puteri Gunung Ledang|a traditional Malay legend]]. This film recounts the love story between Gusti Putri Retno Dumilah, a Majapahit princess, and [[Hang Tuah]], a [[Malaccan Sultanate|Malaccan]] admiral.\n# ''[[Gajah Mada (book)|Gajah Mada]]'', a [[pentalogy]] written by [[Langit Kresna Hariadi]] depicting a fictionalised detail of [[Gajah Mada]]'s life from the [[Gajah Mada#Rise to Mahapatih|Kuti rebellion]] up to the [[Gajah Mada#The Bubat Accident|Bubat War]].\n# ''[[Dyah Pitaloka]]'' (2007), a novel written by Hermawan Aksan, fictionalising the detailed life story of Sundanese princess [[Dyah Pitaloka Citraresmi]] set around the [[Gajah Mada#The Bubat Accident|Bubat War]]. The novel virtually takes the same context and was inspired by the [[Kidung Sundayana]].\n# ''Jung Jawa'' (2009), an anthology of short stories written by Rendra Fatrisna Kurniawan, imagining the life of the Nusantara people, published by Babel Publishing.\n# ''[[Civilization 5: Brave New World]] (2013)'', where [[Gajah Mada]] appeared as one of the leaders of a great civilisation in the second expansion of the [[Civilization 5]] game. He is the leader of the Indonesian civilisation, with the emblem of the Indonesian empire being the [[Surya Majapahit]], although in the game the empire is known as the \"Indonesian empire\" instead.\n# Later, in [[Civilization VI|''Civilization 6 (2016),'']] ''a'' downloadable content has one of its rulers, [[Tribhuwana Wijayatunggadewi|Dyah Gitarja]] (referred as Gitarja in-game) as the leader of the Indonesian civilization, with the emblem being a simpler version of the Surya Majapahit. The unique unit of Indonesian civilization is the ''jong''.\n# On the ''Rise of the Rajas'' expansion pack from ''[[Age of Empires II]]'', [[Gajah Mada]] appears in a campaign detailing his rise and then fall after the Pasunda Bubat tragedy.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Indonesia}}\n{{div col}}\n* [[Gosari inscription]]\n* [[Kidung Sunda]]\n* [[List of monarchs of Java]]\n* [[Osing people|Osing]]\n* [[Srivijaya]]\n* [[Tenggerese people|Tenggerese]]\n* [[Hinduism in Indonesia]]\n{{col div end}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist | group=lower-roman | close}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em|refs=\n<ref name=miksic>{{Cite book\n| isbn      = 9813018267\n| series    = Indonesian Heritage Series\n| title     = Ancient History\n| publisher = Archipelago Press / Editions Didier Millet\n| year      = 1999\n| editor    = John Miksic\n| volume    = Vol 1\n}}</ref>\n<ref name=ricklefs>{{Cite book\n| isbn      = 9780804721950\n| last      = Ricklefs\n| first     = Merle Calvin\n| title     = A history of modern Indonesia since c. 1300\n| year      = 1993\n| publisher = Stanford University Press / Macmillans\n| edition   = 2nd\n}}</ref>\n<ref name=yingyai>{{Cite book\n| isbn      = 9780521010320\n| author    = Ma Huan\n| title     = [[Yingya Shenglan|Ying-yai Sheng-lan]] (\u701b\u6daf\u80dc\u89c8) The Overall Survey of the Ocean's Shores\n| others    = translated by J.V.G Mills\n| language  = Chinese\n| origyear  = 1433\n| year      = 1970\n| publisher = Cambridge University Press\n| series    = [[Hakluyt Society]]\n}}</ref>\n}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Majapahit}}\n{{div col}}\n* [http://www.eastjava.com/books/trowulan/history/history.html A Short History of Majapahit]\n* [http://www.eastjava.com/books/majapahit/ Memoirs of Majapahit Kingdom]\n* [http://users.skynet.be/network.indonesia/ni4001c6.htm A brief history of Majapahit]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20120125090000/http://sejarahnasional.org/index.php/kerajaan-nusantara/1-terjemahan-manuskrip-nagarakertagama A Complete Transcription of Majapahit Royal Manuscript of Nagarakertagama from SejarahNasional.org an National History Website]\n{{col div end}}\n\n{{Precolonial states in Indonesia}}\n{{Asia in topic|Hinduism in}}\n{{Empires}}\n{{Coord missing|Indonesia}}\n\n[[Category:1527 disestablishments in Asia]]\n[[Category:States and territories established in 1293]]\n[[Category:States and territories disestablished in 1527]]\n[[Category:Historical Hindu empires]]\n[[Category:Precolonial states of Indonesia]]\n[[Category:1293 establishments in Asia]]\n[[Category:Former countries in Malaysian history]]\n[[Category:Majapahit]]\n[[Category:Former empires in Asia]]\n[[Category:Former countries in Indonesian history]]\n[[Category:Hindu Buddhist states in Indonesia]]\n[[Category:Island countries]]\n[[Category:Indianized kingdoms]]\n", "name_user": "Gunkarta", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eRelations with regional powers", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majapahit"}

Although Jason did not receive positive response initially, he started to gain more popularity in 2010.\n\nEncouraged by the rise of his popularity, Chen released his first original album, \u201cGravity\u201d. Later, he released his second and third original album \u201cNever for Nothing\u201d<ref>{{Cite web|title = Never for Nothing by Jason Chen on iTunes|url = https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/never-for-nothing/id623924356|publisher = iTunes Store|accessdate = December 16, 2015}}</ref> and \"What If Acoustic\"<ref>{{Cite web|title = What If Acoustic by Jason Chen on iTunes|url = https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/what-if-acoustic/id736204302|publisher = iTunes Store|accessdate = December 16, 2015}}</ref> in 2013.\n\nIn 2014, Chen performed on the main stage at California food festival [[626 Night Market]].\n\n==Biography==\nChen was born in [[Boston|Boston, Massachusetts]] to Taiwanese parents but soon moved to [[Arcadia, California]], when he was a few months old.  He attended [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]] in 2006 and graduated in 2010 with a BA in Economics. Although he grew up in the United States, he can still speak fluently in his main language, Mandarin; thus, he is able to easily communicate to his fans in Taiwan through his secondary channel \u2013 JasonChenAsia.<ref>{{Cite web|title = JasonChenAsia|url = https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgjnr7bWvrYtSBtvbm2Pk5Q|via = YouTube|accessdate = December 16, 2015}}</ref> Furthermore, Chen's mother is a piano teacher, so he had the advantage of growing up under the influence of music and was given opportunities to learn many different instruments, such as the piano, the guitar, and the violin.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOiG3dxzaVo|title=\u5e74\u4ee3\u65b0\u805e Jason Chen \u9673\u4ee5\u6850 \u7368\u5bb6\u5c08\u8a2a-2011-08-10|last=Hui-Ping Lee|date=August 12, 2011|accessdate=February 15, 2019|via=YouTube}}</ref> Chen discovered his vocal talent at the age of 18 when he was planning a proposal to his high school crush.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jasondchen.com/|title=Jason Chen|date=n.d.|website=jasondchen.com|accessdate=February 15, 2019}}</ref> After graduating from UCLA, he became an accountant for about a year, but later decided to mainly focus on producing music.\n\n==Discography==\n*''Gravity'' \u2013 2011<ref>http://www.jasonchenstore.com/products/gravity-lp (dead link)</ref>\n*''Jie Sheng Qian'' (Taiwanese cover album) \u2013 February 2013<ref>{{cite web|url=https://jasonchenmusic.bandcamp.com/album/-|title=\u8282\u7701\u94b1, by Jason Chen \u8282\u7701\u94b1|date=n.d.|website=Jason Chen Music Never Sleeps|accessdate=February 15, 2019}}</ref>\n*''Never for Nothing'' \u2013 April 2013<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ww9.jasonchenstore.com/|title=jasonchenstore.com|date=n.d.|website=ww9.jasonchenstore.com|accessdate=February 15, 2019}}</ref> \n*''What If'' \u2013 November 2013<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ww9.jasonchenstore.com/|title=jasonchenstore.com|date=n.d.|website=ww9.jasonchenstore.com|accessdate=February 15, 2019}}</ref>\n*''Glass Heart'' \u2013 December 2014<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ww9.jasonchenstore.com/|title=jasonchenstore.com|date=n.d.|website=ww9.jasonchenstore.com|accessdate=February 15, 2019}}</ref>\n\n{{commonscat}}\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://www.facebook.com/JasonChenMusic?fref=ts Official Facebook]\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Chen, Jason}}\n[[Category:1988 births]]\n[[Category:American people of Taiwanese descent]]\n[[Category:Taiwanese male singers]]\n[[Category:Taiwanese pop singers]]\n[[Category:Neo soul singers]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:21st-century American singers]]\n", "name_user": "StayGoId", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Chen_(singer)"}

He played for the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands national team]] as well as a host of professional clubs in Europe. He is the older twin brother of [[Frank de Boer]]. The majority of his success as a football player was with [[AFC Ajax|Ajax]]. He works as the Ajax A1 assistant manager.\n\n==Playing career==\n===Club===\nDe Boer's first youth club was De Zouaven in [[Lutjebroek]] where he played before being selected for the Ajax youth programme in 1983. On the professional club level, De Boer played for [[AFC Ajax|Ajax]] (1988\u201391 and 1993\u201399), [[FC Twente|Twente]] (1991\u201393), [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]] (1999\u20132000), [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] (2000\u201304), [[Al Rayyan Sports Club|Al-Rayyan]] (2004\u201305) and [[Al-Shamal]] (2005\u201308). In both Qatari clubs, he was reunited again with his brother Frank, his teammate at Ajax, Barcelona and Rangers.\n\nIn his first spell at Ajax from 1988 to 1991, he won the [[Eredivisie]] title in [[1989\u201390 Eredivisie|1989\u201390]] under manager [[Leo Beenhakker]]. After two seasons at [[FC Twente|Twente]] from 1991 to 1993, he returned to Ajax under manager [[Louis van Gaal]], and had his most successful spell as a player, winning three consecutive [[Eredivisie]] titles in [[1993\u201394 Eredivisie|1993\u201394]], [[1994\u201395 Eredivisie|1994\u201395]] and [[1995\u201396 Eredivisie|1995\u201396]]. He also won the [[1995 UEFA Champions League Final|1995 UEFA Champions League]], the [[1995 Intercontinental Cup]], and the [[1995 UEFA Super Cup]]. He was also a runner-up of the [[1996 UEFA Champions League Final|1996 UEFA Champions League]], where Ajax lost on penalties to [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]]. When Louis van Gaal left Ajax for Barcelona in July 1997, [[Morten Olsen]] became the new Ajax manager, and De Boer won a fifth Eredivisie title in [[1997\u201398 Eredivisie|1997\u201398]] and also won the [[1997\u201398 KNVB Cup]].\n\nThere was then controversy soon after De Boer and his twin brother [[Frank de Boer|Frank]] signed a six-year contract extension with Ajax at the start [[1998\u201399 AFC Ajax season|1998\u201399 season]], when Ronald and Frank took successful legal action to have the contract voided. Ajax had agreed verbally that if a lucrative offer for one brother came by, he would be released provided the other stayed. Ajax, however, apparently backed down on that agreement after floating the club on the stock market and pledging to shareholders that it would hold both of the De Boers and build around them a team to recapture the UEFA Champions League.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1998/07/29/sports/29iht-soccer.t_14.html The De Boers tackle contract law] New York Times, 29 July 1998.</ref>\n\nThe fallout over the contract situation led to an increasing conflict between the De Boer twins and the Ajax hierarchy, with match results for Ajax suffering and manager Morten Olsen soon getting sacked. In January 1999, Frank and Ronald signed for Barcelona for  \u00a322&nbsp;million, joining their former Ajax manager Louis van Gaal at the [[Camp Nou]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.trouw.nl/tr/nl/5009/Archief/archief/article/detail/2474024/1999/01/16/Ultiem-akkoord-Ajax-en-Barcelona.dhtml|title=Ultiem akkoord Ajax en Barcelona|date=16 January 1999|accessdate=30 April 2014|language=Dutch|work=Trouw}}</ref>\n\nWhile De Boer was impressive at Ajax during the 1990s and for the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]] up to and including the [[1998 FIFA World Cup]], his high-profile transfer to Barcelona in January 1999 marked what would be an unlikely bad patch for a prolific goal-scoring midfielder, as he managed to feature in only 33 [[La Liga]] games for the club and scored just one goal in La Liga. In the 2000\u201301 season, he opted to join the Dutch legion at [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] under the manager [[Dick Advocaat]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/r/rangers/902752.stm |title=Rangers swoop for De Boer and Hartson |publisher=[[BBC]] |date=30 August 2000 |accessdate=13 April 2020}}</ref> Among the Dutch internationals who at that time played for Rangers were [[Bert Konterman]], [[Arthur Numan]], [[Fernando Ricksen]] and [[Giovanni van Bronckhorst]].

On 19 March 2008, De Boer canceled his contract with Qatari outfit Al-Shamal and retired.\n\n===International career===\n[[File:Ronald de Boer.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Ronald de Boer in Netherlands colours]]\nDe Boer won 67 [[Cap (sport)|caps]] and scored 13 goals for the Netherlands national team. He played for the Netherlands in the [[1994 FIFA World Cup|1994]] and the [[1998 FIFA World Cup|1998]] [[FIFA World Cup|World Cups]], where he played in six matches and scored two goals. He missed a penalty in the [[Penalty shoot-out (association football)|penalty shootout]] against [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] in the 1998 semi-finals. De Boer also played in [[UEFA Euro 1996|Euro 1996]] and [[UEFA Euro 2000|Euro 2000]].\n\nIn the Dutch national team, De Boer was used in various positions, including right-half, centre forward and attacking midfielder. In his early Ajax years, De Boer played either centre forward or attacking midfielder. In later years, he shifted to right midfield.\n\nDe Boer was never officially captain of the Dutch national team or Ajax, but he has worn the captain's armband on several occasions for both club teams and the national team when the first-choice captain was not playing. In most teams, this was his brother Frank, with whom he has played side by side for most of his career.\n\n==Managerial career==\nDe Boer is Ajax A1 assistant manager.\n\n==Career

football|footballer]] who played as [[midfielder]]. He played for the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands national team]] as well as a host of professional clubs in Europe. He is the older twin brother of [[Frank de Boer]]. The majority of his success as a football player was with [[AFC Ajax|Ajax]]. He works as the Ajax A1 assistant manager.\n\n==Playing career==\n===Club===\nDe Boer's first youth club was De Zouaven in [[Lutjebroek]] where he played before being selected for the Ajax youth programme in 1983. On the professional club level, De Boer played for [[AFC Ajax|Ajax]] (1988\u201391 and 1993\u201399), [[FC Twente|Twente]] (1991\u201393), [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]] (1999\u20132000), [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] (2000\u201304), [[Al Rayyan Sports Club|Al-Rayyan]] (2004\u201305) and [[Al-Shamal]] (2005\u201308). In both Qatari clubs, he was reunited again with his brother Frank, his teammate at Ajax, Barcelona and Rangers.\n\nIn his first spell at Ajax from 1988 to 1991, he won the [[Eredivisie]] title in [[1989\u201390 Eredivisie|1989\u201390]] under manager [[Leo Beenhakker]]. After two seasons at [[FC Twente|Twente]] from 1991 to 1993, he returned to Ajax under manager [[Louis van Gaal]], and had his most successful spell as a player, winning three consecutive [[Eredivisie]] titles in [[1993\u201394 Eredivisie|1993\u201394]], [[1994\u201395 Eredivisie|1994\u201395]] and [[1995\u201396 Eredivisie|1995\u201396]]. He also won the [[1995 UEFA Champions League Final|1995 UEFA Champions League]], the [[1995 Intercontinental Cup]], and the [[1995 UEFA Super Cup]]. He was also a runner-up of the [[1996 UEFA Champions League Final|1996 UEFA Champions League]], where Ajax lost on penalties to [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]]. When Louis van Gaal left Ajax for Barcelona in July 1997, [[Morten Olsen]] became the new Ajax manager, and De Boer won a fifth Eredivisie title in [[1997\u201398 Eredivisie|1997\u201398]] and also won the [[1997\u201398 KNVB Cup]].\n\nThere was then controversy soon after De Boer and his twin brother [[Frank de Boer|Frank]] signed a six-year contract extension with Ajax at the start [[1998\u201399 AFC Ajax season|1998\u201399 season]], when Ronald and Frank took successful legal action to have the contract voided. Ajax had agreed verbally that if a lucrative offer for one brother came by, he would be released provided the other stayed. Ajax, however, apparently backed down on that agreement after floating the club on the stock market and pledging to shareholders that it would hold both of the De Boers and build around them a team to recapture the UEFA Champions League.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1998/07/29/sports/29iht-soccer.t_14.html The De Boers tackle contract law] New York Times, 29 July 1998.</ref>\n\nThe fallout over the contract situation led to an increasing conflict between the De Boer twins and the Ajax hierarchy, with match results for Ajax suffering and manager Morten Olsen soon getting sacked. In January 1999, Frank and Ronald signed for Barcelona for  \u00a322&nbsp;million, joining their former Ajax manager Louis van Gaal at the [[Camp Nou]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.trouw.nl/tr/nl/5009/Archief/archief/article/detail/2474024/1999/01/16/Ultiem-akkoord-Ajax-en-Barcelona.dhtml|title=Ultiem akkoord Ajax en Barcelona|date=16 January 1999|accessdate=30 April 2014|language=Dutch|work=Trouw}}</ref>\n\nWhile De Boer was impressive at Ajax during the 1990s and for the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]] up to and including the [[1998 FIFA World Cup]], his high-profile transfer to Barcelona in January 1999 marked what would be an unlikely bad patch for a prolific goal-scoring midfielder, as he managed to feature in only 33 [[La Liga]] games for the club and scored just one goal in La Liga. In the 2000\u201301 season, he opted to join the Dutch legion at [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] under the manager [[Dick Advocaat]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/r/rangers/902752.stm |title=Rangers swoop for De Boer and Hartson |publisher=[[BBC]] |date=30 August 2000 |accessdate=13 April 2020}}</ref> Among the Dutch internationals who at that time played for Rangers were [[Bert Konterman]], [[Arthur Numan]], [[Fernando Ricksen]] and [[Giovanni van Bronckhorst]].

On 19 March 2008, De Boer canceled his contract with Qatari outfit Al-Shamal and retired.\n\n===International career===\n[[File:Ronald de Boer.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Ronald de Boer in Netherlands colours]]\nDe Boer won 67 [[Cap (sport)|caps]] and scored 13 goals for the Netherlands national team. He played for the Netherlands in the [[1994 FIFA World Cup|1994]] and the [[1998 FIFA World Cup|1998]] [[FIFA World Cup|World Cups]], where he played in six matches and scored two goals. He missed a penalty in the [[Penalty shoot-out (association football)|penalty shootout]] against [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] in the 1998 semi-finals. De Boer also played in [[UEFA Euro 1996|Euro 1996]] and [[UEFA Euro 2000|Euro 2000]].\n\nIn the Dutch national team, De Boer was used in various positions, including right-half, centre forward and attacking midfielder. In his early Ajax years, De Boer played either centre forward or attacking midfielder. In later years, he shifted to right midfield.\n\nDe Boer was never officially captain of the Dutch national team or Ajax, but he has worn the captain's armband on several occasions for both club teams and the national team when the first-choice captain was not playing.
