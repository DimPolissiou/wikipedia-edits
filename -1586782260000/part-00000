The [[American Legion]] and [[Air Force Association]] believed the exhibit put forward only one side of the [[debate over the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]], and that it emphasized the effect on victims without discussing its use within the overall context of the war.

According to documents and e-mails, the exhibit and its associated presentation were edited at high levels to add \"scientific uncertainty\" regarding the nature and impact of [[global warming]] on the [[Arctic]]. Acting Secretary of the Smithsonian [[Cristi\u00e1n Samper]] was interviewed by the ''Post'', and claimed the exhibit was edited because it contained conclusions that went beyond what could be proven by contemporary [[climatology]].<ref>{{Cite news |title=Scientists Fault Climate Exhibit Changes |date=November 16, 2007|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/11/15/AR2007111502550.html?hpid=topnews |work=[[Washington Post]] |page=4 |accessdate=November 18, 2007 |first1=James V. |last1=Grimaldi |first2=Jacqueline |last2=Trescott |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110429173254/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/11/15/AR2007111502550.html?hpid=topnews |archivedate=April 29, 2011}}</ref> The Smithsonian is now a participant in the [[U.S. Global Change Research Program]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.globalchange.gov/about/program-structure/agencies |title=Integrating federal research and solutions for climate and global change |work=Participating Departments and Agencies |publisher=U.S. Global Change Research Program |accessdate=March 30, 2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100310123640/http://globalchange.gov/about/program-structure/agencies |archivedate=March 10, 2010}}</ref>\n\n===Copyright restrictions===\nThe Smithsonian Institution provides access to its image collections for educational, scholarly, and nonprofit uses.
