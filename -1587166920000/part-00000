In the 1960s, international business courses were introduced and soon became an important focus of the school's curriculum. The New York University, Graduate School of Business Administration, C.J. Devine Institute of Finance (1959\u20131966) published many key Finance and Investment bulletins related to International finance. The school awarded its first Doctor of Commercial Sciences degree in 1970.\n<!--a series of publications followed...

Stern (B.S., 1957; M.B.A., 1959) allowed the school to consolidate its graduate and undergraduate facilities at NYU's Washington Square campus. The school was renamed Leonard N. Stern School of Business. In 1992, Stern's new $68 million state-of-the-art facility, now known as Kaufman Management Center, was inaugurated.\n\nIn 1998, a $10 million gift from [[Henry Kaufman]] (PhD 1958) supported a major expansion and upgrading of Stern's facilities. The new and renovated space is used almost exclusively to improve the quality of student life. Prominent investment banker and Home Depot investor [[Kenneth Langone]] (MBA 1960) donated $10 million to Stern in 1999. The Langone MBA for Working Professionals was renamed in his honor. Celebrating its 100th birthday in the year 2000, Stern launched a $100 million centennial campaign, the school's most ambitious fundraising effort to date. The campaign doubled the school's endowment, the number of named professorships, and the level of student financial aid.\n\n[[Peter Blair Henry]] became dean of the school in January 2010.<ref name=ft20100221>{{cite news|last=Murray|first=Sarah|title=The bigger picture|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/703f0e20-1d74-11df-a893-00144feab49a.html#axzz2E8r07iXd|accessdate=December 4, 2012|newspaper=[[Financial Times]]|date=February 21, 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn 2010, the {{convert|84500|sqft|m2|adj=on}} renovation of the three Stern School of Business buildings, known as the Stern Concourse Project, was completed.<ref>{{cite web|title=Light, transparency and brand connect Stern students, faculty and New York City|url=http://www.worldarchitecturenews.com/index.php?fuseaction=wanappln.projectview&upload_id=13465|publisher=World Architecture News.com|accessdate=December 24, 2012|date=February 24, 2010}}</ref>  This project was fully funded by donors, alumni and corporate partners.<ref>{{cite web|title=Concourse Project|url=http://w4.stern.nyu.edu/concourse/index.html|publisher=New York University|accessdate=December 24, 2012}}</ref>\n\nNYU Stern Westchester offers its Langone MBA for Working Professionals in [[Purchase, New York]], at [[State University of New York at Purchase|SUNY Purchase]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stern.nyu.edu/programs-admissions/part-time-mba-westchester/index.htm |title=NYU Stern &#124; Part-time MBA Westchester &#124; Home |publisher=Stern.nyu.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-03-05}}</ref>\n\n==Academics==\n{{Infobox business school rankings\n| QSglobal = 19\n| BI = 16\n| Economist = 19\n| FT = 19\n| BWg = 17\n| Forbes = 18\n| USNWRg = 10\n| Vault = 9\n| USNWRu = 5\n}}\n\nAs of 2009, 2,305 students are enrolled in Stern's undergraduate program and 2,969 are enrolled in its [[Master of Business Administration]] (MBA) program.

Similar to the Wharton School, students choose to concentrate in specific fields of business study after their sophomore year. The two most popular concentrations are finance (with 76% of students pursuing this concentration) and accounting (with 26% of students pursuing this concentration). The 13 concentrations offered by Stern are:  Accounting, Actuarial Science, Business Economics, Computing and Data Science, Econometrics and Quantitative Economics, Entrepreneurship (co-concentration only), Finance, Global Business (co-concentration only), Management, Marketing, Operations, Statistics, and Sustainable Business (co-concentration only).<ref name=\"NYU Stern\">{{cite web | url=http://www.stern.nyu.edu/programs-admissions/undergraduate/academics/business-program/areas-of-study | title=Areas of Study - NYU Stern | publisher=NYU Stern}}</ref>\n\n;Business and Political Economy (BPE) Undergraduate Degree:\n\nIn 2009, Stern launched its highly selective Business and Political Economy program (BPE). The program has a ~2% matriculation rate as of 2018.  More than 850 students applied to the BPE program for the Class of 2015, and approximately 100 were accepted to yield an ultimate class size of ~50 students. Yield rates are >75%, although Stern does not yet publish official statistics for the BPE program.  BPE students study the same business core curriculum as traditional Stern undergrads, however, they have additional specialized tracks including cores in Liberal Arts, Politics, Social Impact and Economics. Students attend their first year at Stern in New York City before spending one semester at NYU London and one semester at NYU Shanghai during their second year.<ref>{{cite web|title=Semesters Abroad|url=http://www.stern.nyu.edu/UC/ProspectiveStudent/Academics/PoliticalProgram/SemestersAbroad/index.htm|publisher=NYU Stern}}</ref> Students also have the option of spending a third semester abroad at one of NYU's other global locations. The Program's Director describes the BPE degree as \"Stern and then some.\" Students graduate with a B.S. in Business & Political Economy; the inaugural class graduated in 2013.\n\n==Stern Graduate Program==\n'''Executive Programs'''\n\nStern offers three Global Executive Programs.\n\nStern Executive MBA program is a top ranked program for seasoned executives that is currently ranked 4th nationally by US News and World Reports.\n\n*Executive MBA: New York City\n*Executive MBA: Washington, D.C.\n*TRIUM Global Executive MBA Program is a joint program with the London School of Economics and the HEC Paris.

Services replying with pure [[JSON]] data, however, were not able to share data from foreign origins before the adoption of CORS ([[Cross-origin resource sharing]]).  \n\nFor example, a request to a foreign service <code><nowiki>http://server.example.com/Users/1234</nowiki></code> may return a record for a person named Alice in the JSON format. JSON syntax is consistent with JavaScript's object syntax. \n<source lang=\"json\" line=\"1\">\n{\n    \"Name\": \"Alice\",\n    \"Id\": 1234,\n    \"Rank\": 7\n}\n</source>\n\nWithout support for CORS, an attempt to use the data across domains results in a JavaScript error.\n\n<source lang=\"html4strict\" line=\"1\">\n<script type=\"application/javascript\"\n        src=\"http://server.example.com/Users/1234\">\n</script>\n</source>\n\nThe browser will download the <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> file, evaluate its contents, misinterpret the raw JSON data as a block, and throw a syntax error. Even if the data were interpreted as a JavaScript object literal, it could not be accessed by JavaScript running in the browser, since without a variable assignment, object literals are inaccessible.\n\nIn the JSONP usage pattern, the URL request pointed to by the <code>src</code> attribute in the <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> element returns JSON data, with JavaScript code (usually a function call) wrapped around it. This \"wrapped payload\" is then interpreted by the browser. In this way, a function that is already defined in the JavaScript environment can manipulate the JSON data. A typical JSONP request and response are shown below.\n\nThe function call to parseResponse() is the \"P\" of JSONP\u2014the \"padding\" or \"prefix\" around the pure JSON.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://epimorph-pubx1.appspot.com/help.html |title=Experimental RDF result set to JSON translator |access-date=February 20, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141115070803/http://epimorph-pubx1.appspot.com/help.html |archive-date=November 15, 2014 }}</ref> For JSONP to work, a server must reply with a response that includes the JSONP function. JSONP does not work with JSON-formatted results. The JSONP function invocation that gets sent back, and the payload that the function receives, must be agreed upon by the client and server. By convention, the server providing the JSON data offers the requesting website to name the JSONP function, typically using the name jsonp or [[callback (computer programming)|callback]]  as the named query-string parameter, in its request to the server:  <code><script src=\"<nowiki>http://server.example.com/Users/1234?callback=parseResponse</nowiki>\"><nowiki></script></nowiki></code>.\n\nIn this example, the received payload would be:\n\n<source lang=\"javascript\">\nparseResponse({\"Name\": \"Alice\", \"Id\": 1234, \"Rank\": 7});\n</source>\n\n== Script element injection ==\nJSONP makes sense only when used with a script element.  For each new JSONP request, the browser must add a new <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> element, or reuse an existing one.  The former option\u2014adding a new script element\u2014is done via dynamic DOM manipulation, and is known as ''script element injection''.  The <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> element is injected into the HTML DOM, with the URL of the desired JSONP endpoint set as the \"src\" attribute. This dynamic ''script element injection'' is usually done by a JavaScript helper library. [[jQuery]] and other frameworks have JSONP helper functions; there are also standalone options.\n\nAn example of using jQuery to ''dynamically inject'' script element for a JSONP call looks like this:\n\n<source lang=\"javascript\">\n$.getScript(\"http://server.example.com/Users/192.168.73.96?callback=parseResponse\");\n</source>\n\nAfter the element is injected, the browser evaluates the element, and performs an HTTP GET on the src URL, retrieving the content. Then the browser evaluates the return payload as JavaScript. This is typically a function invocation. In that way, the use of JSONP can allow browser pages to work around the [[same-origin policy]] via script element injection.{{fact|date=December 2019}}\n\nThe script runs within the scope of the including page and, as such, is still subject to cross-domain restrictions relative to the domain of the including page. This means that a web page cannot, for example, load a library hosted on another site via JSONP and then make XMLHttpRequest requests to that site (unless [[cross-origin resource sharing]] (CORS) is supported), although one could use such a library to make XMLHttpRequests to one's own site.\n\n== Security concerns ==\n\n=== Untrusted third-party code ===\nIncluding script tags from remote servers allows the remote servers to inject ''any'' content into a website. If the remote servers have vulnerabilities that allow JavaScript injection, the page served from the original server is exposed to an increased risk.  If an attacker can inject any JavaScript into the original web page, then that code can retrieve additional JavaScript from any domain, bypassing the [[same-origin policy]].<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.blackhat.com/docs/eu-14/materials/eu-14-Hayak-Same-Origin-Method-Execution-Some-Exploiting-A-Callback-For-Same-Origin-Policy-Bypass.pdf | title=Same Origin Method Execution | date=2014-10-17 | accessdate=2014-10-22 | author=Ben Hayak}}</ref>  The Content Security Policy HTTP Header lets web sites tell web browsers which domain scripts may be included from.\n\nAn effort was undertaken around 2011 to define a safer strict subset definition for JSONP<ref name=\"JSON-P\">{{cite web |url=http://www.json-p.org/ |title=Safer cross-domain Ajax with JSON-P/JSONP |work=JSON-P.org |access-date=2011-10-30 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304044218/http://www.json-p.org/ |archive-date=March 4, 2016}}</ref> that browsers would be able to enforce on script requests with a specific [[MIME]] type such as \"application/json-p\".

This will allow the JSON-encoded data to be evaluated in the context of the malicious page, possibly divulging passwords or other sensitive data if the user is currently logged into the other site.\n\nThis is problematic only if the JSON-encoded data contains sensitive information which should not be disclosed to a third party, and the server depends on the [[same-origin policy]] of the browser to block the delivery of the sensitive information.\n\n=== Rosetta Flash ===\nRosetta Flash is an exploitation technique that allows an attacker to exploit servers with a vulnerable JSONP endpoint by causing [[Adobe Flash Player]] to believe that an attacker-specified Flash applet originated on the vulnerable server. Flash Player implements [[same-origin policy]] allowing one to make requests (with cookies) and receive responses from the hosting site. The applet can then send the retrieved data back to the attacker. This is a cross-origin exploit with an impact similar to embedding an arbitrary Flash applet in the vulnerable domain. The exploit uses an ActionScript payload compiled to an SWF file composed entirely of alphanumeric characters by crafting a [[zlib]] stream with a particular header and [[DEFLATE]] blocks with ad-hoc [[Huffman coding]]. The resulting alphanumeric-only SWF file is then used as the callback parameter of a JSONP call. High-profile sites such as Google, YouTube, Twitter, Yahoo!, Yandex, LinkedIn, eBay, Instagram and Tumblr were all vulnerable until July 2014.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Michele|first1=Spagnuolo|title=Abusing JSONP with Rosetta Flash|url=http://miki.it/blog/2014/7/8/abusing-jsonp-with-rosetta-flash/|accessdate=July 20, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140721100312/http://miki.it/blog/2014/7/8/abusing-jsonp-with-rosetta-flash/|archive-date=July 21, 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> This vulnerability was discovered and published by Google security engineer Michele Spagnuolo<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.google.com/about/appsecurity/research/ |title=Google - list of software vulnerabilities discovered or fixed by Googlers|accessdate=July 29, 2014}}</ref> and has [[Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures|CVE]] 2014-4671<ref>{{cite web |url=https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-4671 |title=MITRE: CVE-2014-4671 |accessdate=July 29, 2014}}</ref> and CVE 2014-5333.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-5333 |title=MITRE: CVE-2014-5333 |accessdate=August 21, 2014}}</ref> Adobe Flash Player release version 14.0.0.145, released on July 8, 2014, introduced stronger validation of Flash files,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://helpx.adobe.com/security/products/flash-player/apsb14-17.html |title=Adobe Security Bulletin APSB14-17 |accessdate=July 29, 2014}}</ref> and in version 14.0.0.176, released on August 12, 2014, finalized the fix,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://helpx.adobe.com/security/products/flash-player/apsb14-18.html |title=Adobe Security Bulletin APSB14-18 |accessdate=August 21, 2014}}</ref> preventing this exploit from working.\n\n== History ==\nIn July 2005, George Jempty suggested an optional variable assignment be prepended to JSON.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://htmatters.net/htm/1/2005/07/evaling-JSON.cfm |title=eval'ing JSON |date=July 19, 2005 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060212113746/http://htmatters.net/htm/1/2005/07/evaling-JSON.cfm |archive-date=February 12, 2006 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/json/message/82 |title=json: Message: Re: Comments |date=August 17, 2005}}</ref>  The original proposal for JSONP, where the padding is a callback function, appears to have been made by Bob Ippolito in December 2005<ref>{{cite web |url=http://bob.pythonmac.org/archives/2005/12/05/remote-json-jsonp/ |work=from __future__ import * |title=Remote JSON - JSONP |publisher=Bob.pythonmac.org |date=December 5, 2005 |accessdate=September 8, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091204053053/http://bob.pythonmac.org/archives/2005/12/05/remote-json-jsonp/ |archive-date=December 4, 2009 |url-status=dead }}</ref> and is now used by many [[Web 2.0]] applications such as [[Dojo Toolkit]], [[Google Web Toolkit]] and [[Web service]]s.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Cross-origin resource sharing|Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS)]]\n* [[Web Messaging|Cross-document messaging]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [https://code.google.com/p/jsonp-java/ server side filter wraps any response into a jsonp callback]{{snd}}done with jsonp-java source code\n* [http://quaxio.com/jsonp_handcrafted_flash_files/ Potential security issues related to JSON]\n* [https://datatables.net/examples/server_side/jsonp.html JSONP data source for remote domains]\n\n[[Category:Ajax (programming)]]\n[[Category:JSON]]\n", "text_old": "'''JSONP''' or '''JSON-P''' (''JSON with Padding'') is a JavaScript technique for requesting data by loading a {{code|<script>}} tag.<ref name=\"JSON-P\"/> It was proposed by Bob Ippolito in 2005.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://bob.ippoli.to/archives/2005/12/05/remote-json-jsonp/ |title=Remote JSON - JSONP |last=Ippolito |first=Bob |date=December 5, 2005 |website=Bob Ippolito on Haskell, Python, Erlang, JavaScript, etc. |language=en |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120608162347/http://bob.ippoli.to/archives/2005/12/05/remote-json-jsonp/|archive-date=2012-06-08|url-status=dead|access-date=2017-02-10}}</ref> JSONP enables sharing of data bypassing [[same-origin policy]], which disallows running [[JavaScript]] code to read media [[Document Object Model]] (DOM) elements or [[XMLHttpRequest]] data fetched from outside the page's originating site.

This means that a web page cannot, for example, load a library hosted on another site via JSONP and then make XMLHttpRequest requests to that site (unless [[cross-origin resource sharing]] (CORS) is supported), although one could use such a library to make XMLHttpRequests to one's own site.\n\n== Security concerns ==\n\n=== Untrusted third-party code ===\nIncluding script tags from remote servers allows the remote servers to inject ''any'' content into a website. If the remote servers have vulnerabilities that allow JavaScript injection, the page served from the original server is exposed to an increased risk.  If an attacker can inject any JavaScript into the original web page, then that code can retrieve additional JavaScript from any domain, bypassing the [[same-origin policy]].<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.blackhat.com/docs/eu-14/materials/eu-14-Hayak-Same-Origin-Method-Execution-Some-Exploiting-A-Callback-For-Same-Origin-Policy-Bypass.pdf | title=Same Origin Method Execution | date=2014-10-17 | accessdate=2014-10-22 | author=Ben Hayak}}</ref>  The Content Security Policy HTTP Header lets web sites tell web browsers which domain scripts may be included from.\n\nAn effort was undertaken around 2011 to define a safer strict subset definition for JSONP<ref name=\"JSON-P\">{{cite web |url=http://www.json-p.org/ |title=Safer cross-domain Ajax with JSON-P/JSONP |work=JSON-P.org |access-date=2011-10-30 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304044218/http://www.json-p.org/ |archive-date=March 4, 2016}}</ref> that browsers would be able to enforce on script requests with a specific [[MIME]] type such as \"application/json-p\". If the response did not parse as strict JSONP, the browser could throw an error or just ignore the entire response. However, this approach was abandoned in favour of [[Cross-origin resource sharing|CORS]], and the correct MIME type for JSONP remains <code>application/javascript</code>.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://stackoverflow.com/a/3128948/569447 |first=Eli |last=Grey |title=Is this safe for providing JSONP? |work=stackoverflow.com |date=2010-06-27 |accessdate=2012-09-07 }}</ref>\n\n=== Whitespace differences ===\n\nJSONP carries the same problems as resolving JSON with {{code|eval()}}: both interpret the JSON text as JavaScript, which means differences in handling U+2028 and U+2029 from JSON proper. This makes some JSON strings non-legal in JSONP; servers serving JSONP must escape these characters prior to transmission.<ref name=\"Magnus Holm\">{{cite web|title=JSON: The JavaScript subset that isn't|url=http://timelessrepo.com/json-isnt-a-javascript-subset|publisher=Magnus Holm|accessdate=16 May 2011}}</ref>\n\n=== Callback name manipulation and reflected file download attack ===\nUnsanitized callback names may be used to pass malicious data to clients, bypassing the restrictions associated with <code>application/json</code> content type, as demonstrated in reflected file download (RFD) attack from 2014.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.trustwave.com/Resources/SpiderLabs-Blog/Reflected-File-Download---A-New-Web-Attack-Vector/ | title=Reflected File Download - A New Web Attack Vector | publisher=TrustWave | date=2014 | accessdate=2015-03-25 | author=Oren Hafif}}</ref>\n\nInsecure JSONP endpoints can be also injected with malicious data.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://securitycafe.ro/2017/01/18/practical-jsonp-injection/ |title=Practical JSONP injection}}</ref>\n\n=== Cross-site request forgery ===\nNaive deployments of JSONP are subject to [[cross-site request forgery]] (CSRF or XSRF) attacks.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://jeremiahgrossman.blogspot.com/2006/01/advanced-web-attack-techniques-using.html |title=Advanced Web Attack Techniques using GMail |first=Jeremiah |last=Grossman |date=January 27, 2006 |accessdate=July 3, 2009}}</ref>  Because the HTML <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag does not respect the [[same-origin policy]] in web browser implementations, a malicious page can request and obtain JSON data belonging to another site.  This will allow the JSON-encoded data to be evaluated in the context of the malicious page, possibly divulging passwords or other sensitive data if the user is currently logged into the other site.\n\nThis is problematic only if the JSON-encoded data contains sensitive information which should not be disclosed to a third party, and the server depends on the [[same-origin policy]] of the browser to block the delivery of the sensitive information.\n\n=== Rosetta Flash ===\nRosetta Flash is an exploitation technique that allows an attacker to exploit servers with a vulnerable JSONP endpoint by causing [[Adobe Flash Player]] to believe that an attacker-specified Flash applet originated on the vulnerable server. Flash Player implements [[same-origin policy]] allowing one to make requests (with cookies) and receive responses from the hosting site. The applet can then send the retrieved data back to the attacker. This is a cross-origin exploit with an impact similar to embedding an arbitrary Flash applet in the vulnerable domain. The exploit uses an ActionScript payload compiled to an SWF file composed entirely of alphanumeric characters by crafting a [[zlib]] stream with a particular header and [[DEFLATE]] blocks with ad-hoc [[Huffman coding]]. The resulting alphanumeric-only SWF file is then used as the callback parameter of a JSONP call. High-profile sites such as Google, YouTube, Twitter, Yahoo!, Yandex, LinkedIn, eBay, Instagram and Tumblr were all vulnerable until July 2014.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Michele|first1=Spagnuolo|title=Abusing JSONP with Rosetta Flash|url=http://miki.it/blog/2014/7/8/abusing-jsonp-with-rosetta-flash/|accessdate=July 20, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140721100312/http://miki.it/blog/2014/7/8/abusing-jsonp-with-rosetta-flash/|archive-date=July 21, 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> This vulnerability was discovered and published by Google security engineer Michele Spagnuolo<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.google.com/about/appsecurity/research/ |title=Google - list of software vulnerabilities discovered or fixed by Googlers|accessdate=July 29, 2014}}</ref> and has [[Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures|CVE]] 2014-4671<ref>{{cite web |url=https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-4671 |title=MITRE: CVE-2014-4671 |accessdate=July 29, 2014}}</ref> and CVE 2014-5333.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-5333 |title=MITRE: CVE-2014-5333 |accessdate=August 21, 2014}}</ref> Adobe Flash Player release version 14.0.0.145, released on July 8, 2014, introduced stronger validation of Flash files,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://helpx.adobe.com/security/products/flash-player/apsb14-17.html |title=Adobe Security Bulletin APSB14-17 |accessdate=July 29, 2014}}</ref> and in version 14.0.0.176, released on August 12, 2014, finalized the fix,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://helpx.adobe.com/security/products/flash-player/apsb14-18.html |title=Adobe Security Bulletin APSB14-18 |accessdate=August 21, 2014}}</ref> preventing this exploit from working.\n\n== History ==\nIn July 2005, George Jempty suggested an optional variable assignment be prepended to JSON.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://htmatters.net/htm/1/2005/07/evaling-JSON.cfm |title=eval'ing JSON |date=July 19, 2005 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060212113746/http://htmatters.net/htm/1/2005/07/evaling-JSON.cfm |archive-date=February 12, 2006 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/json/message/82 |title=json: Message: Re: Comments |date=August 17, 2005}}</ref>  The original proposal for JSONP, where the padding is a callback function, appears to have been made by Bob Ippolito in December 2005<ref>{{cite web |url=http://bob.pythonmac.org/archives/2005/12/05/remote-json-jsonp/ |work=from __future__ import * |title=Remote JSON - JSONP |publisher=Bob.pythonmac.org |date=December 5, 2005 |accessdate=September 8, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091204053053/http://bob.pythonmac.org/archives/2005/12/05/remote-json-jsonp/ |archive-date=December 4, 2009 |url-status=dead }}</ref> and is now used by many [[Web 2.0]] applications such as [[Dojo Toolkit]], [[Google Web Toolkit]] and [[Web service]]s.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Cross-origin resource sharing|Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS)]]\n* [[Web Messaging|Cross-document messaging]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [https://code.google.com/p/jsonp-java/ server side filter wraps any response into a jsonp callback]{{snd}}done with jsonp-java source code\n* [http://quaxio.com/jsonp_handcrafted_flash_files/ Potential security issues related to JSON]\n* [https://datatables.net/examples/server_side/jsonp.html JSONP data source for remote domains]\n\n[[Category:Ajax (programming)]]\n[[Category:JSON]]\n", "name_user": "Shiala", "label": "safe", "comment": "Spelling fix", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSONP"}
