Little is known of his life. He was born and lived in [[Hamadan Province|Hamadan]]<ref name=\"Iranica\" /> [[Hamadan Province|Province]] in [[Iran]]. He was known by the name of Baba Taher-e Oryan (The Naked), which suggests that he may have been a wandering [[dervish]]. Legend tells that the poet, an illiterate woodcutter, attended lectures at a religious school, where he was not welcomed by his fellow-students. The dates of his birth and death are unknown. One source indicates that he died in 1019. If this is accurate, it would make Baba Tahir a contemporary of [[Ferdowsi]] and [[Avicenna]] and an immediate precursor of [[Omar Khayyam]]. Another source reports that he lived between 1000 and 1055, which is unlikely. It is said that Baba Tahir lived for seventy-five years. Rahat al-sodur of Ravandi, whose work was completed 603/1206, describes a meeting between Baba Tahir and the [[Seljuq dynasty|Seljuq]] conqueror [[Tughril]] (pp.&nbsp;98\u201399). At the time when Baba Tahir lived in the 10th century, there were great changes occurring in the development and growth of literature and art. Medieval artists and poets in Persia were greatly respected and valued and had the right to express their thoughts freely.  According to [[L. P. Elwell-Sutton]]: \"He could be described as the first great poet of Sufi love in Persian literature. In the last two decades his do-baytis have often been put to music\".\n\n== Poetry ==\nBaba Tahir's poems are recited to the present day all over Iran accompanied by the [[setar]], the three stringed viol or lute. This style of poetry is known as [[Pahlaviat]] and it is very ancient. The quatrains of Baba Tahir have a more amorous and mystical connotation rather than philosophical.  Many of Baba Tahir's poems are of the ''[[do-bayt\u012b]]'' style, a form of Persian quatrains, which some scholars regard as having affinities with Middle Persian verses.<ref name=\"Iranica\" />\n\n== Writing ==\nAttributed to him is a work by the name Kalemat-e qesaar, a collection of nearly 400 aphorisms in [[Arabic]], which has been the subject of commentaries, one allegedly by Ayn-al-Qozat Hamadani.<ref name=\"Iranica\" /> An example of such a saying is one where Baba Tahir ties knowledge with gnosis: \"Knowledge is the guide to gnosis, and when gnosis has come the vision of knowledge lapses and there remain only the movements of knowledge to gnosis\"; \"knowledge is the crown of the gnostic, and gnosis is the crown of knowledge\"; \"whoever witnesses what is decreed by God remains motionless and powerless.\"\n\n==Tomb==\nHis [[tomb]], designed by Mohsen Foroughi, is located near the northern entrance of the city of [[Hamadan]] in Western Iran, in a park, surrounded by flowers and winding paths. The structure consists of twelve external [[column|pillars]] surrounding a central [[tower]].

The first major Marmite advertising campaign began during the 1930s, with characters whose faces incorporated the word \"good\". Soon afterwards, the increasing awareness of vitamins was used in Marmite advertising, with slogans proclaiming that \"A small quantity added to the daily diet will ensure you and your family are taking sufficient vitamin B to keep nerves, brain, and digestion in proper working order\".\n\nDuring the 1980s, the spread was advertised with the slogan \"My mate, Marmite\", chanted in television commercials by an army platoon. The spread had been a standard vitamin supplement for British-based German [[Prisoner of war|POW]]s during the Second World War.\n\nBy the 1990s Marmite's distinctive and powerful flavour had earned it as many detractors as it had fans, and it was known for producing a polarised \"love/hate\" reaction amongst consumers. For many years television advertisements for Marmite featured the song \"[[Low Rider]]\" by the band [[War (U.S. band)|War]] with the lyrics changed to the phrase \"My Mate, Marmite\". Marmite began a \"Love it or Hate it\" campaign during October 1996, and this resulted in the inventing of the phrase \"Marmite effect\" or \"Marmite reaction\" for anything which provoked controversy.<ref>[[Cath Kidston]], appearing on [[BBC Radio 4]]'s ''[[Desert Island Discs]]'' programme during April 2010 described her shops as provoking a 'Marmite reaction': \"People either love it and want a little bit of it very much, or want to stab us.\" {{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b010lyy4/Desert_Island_Discs_Cath_Kidston/ |title=Desert Island Discs: Cath Kidston |date=29 April 2010 |website=BBC |access-date=29 April 2011}}</ref> On 22 April 2010, Unilever threatened legal action against the [[British National Party]] for using a jar of Marmite and the \"love it or hate it\" slogan for their television advertisements.<ref>{{cite news |title=BNP facing Marmite legal action |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/election_2010/8637473.stm |access-date=22 April 2010 |website=BBC News |date=22 April 2010}}</ref>\n\n==Availability worldwide==\n[[File:Our Mate jar of UK Made Marmite Spread branded for sale in Australia.JPG|thumb|left|upright=.6|''Our Mate''&nbsp;\u2013 Marmite branded for sale in Australia and New Zealand.]]\nBecause of the local product named Marmite, it is sold by the name \"Our Mate\" in Australia and New Zealand.

The dying yeast cells are then heated to complete their breakdown, and since yeast cells have thick cell walls which would detract from the smoothness of the end product, the husks are sieved out. As with other yeast extracts, Marmite contains free [[Glutamic acid (flavor)|glutamic acid]]s, which are analogous to [[monosodium glutamate]].\n\nPresently, the main ingredients of Marmite are glutamic acid-rich yeast extract, with lesser quantities of [[sodium chloride|salt]], vegetable extract, spice extracts and celery extracts, although the precise composition is a [[trade secret]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.marmite.co.uk/love/nutrition/ingredients.html |title=Marmite ingredients (company web site) |website=Marmite.co.uk |access-date=21 June 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080723184424/http://www.marmite.co.uk/love/nutrition/ingredients.html |archivedate=23 July 2008 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Some sources suggest that [[Vitamin B12|Vitamin B<sub>12</sub>]] is not naturally found in yeast extract, and is only present because it is added to Marmite during manufacture.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.nhs.uk/Livewell/Vegetarianhealth/Pages/Vegandiets.aspx |title=The vegan diet - Live Well |website=[[NHS Choices]] |access-date=4 April 2017}}</ref> Others indicate that \"Brewer's and nutritional yeast extracts are also a rich source of B vitamins, particularly B-1, B-2, B-3, B-6, B-12, and folic acid.\" <ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.livestrong.com/article/471516-benefits-of-yeast-extract/ |title=Benefits of Yeast Extract - Vitamins |website=[[Livestrong.com]]}}</ref>\n\n==Nutritional information==\nMarmite is rich in B vitamins including [[thiamin]] (B<sub>1</sub>), [[riboflavin]] (B<sub>2</sub>), [[niacin]] (B<sub>3</sub>), [[folic acid]] (B<sub>9</sub>) and vitamin B<sub>12</sub>.

The first major Marmite advertising campaign began during the 1930s, with characters whose faces incorporated the word \"good\". Soon afterwards, the increasing awareness of vitamins was used in Marmite advertising, with slogans proclaiming that \"A small quantity added to the daily diet will ensure you and your family are taking sufficient vitamin B to keep nerves, brain, and digestion in proper working order\".\n\nDuring the 1980s, the spread was advertised with the slogan \"My mate, Marmite\", chanted in television commercials by an army platoon. The spread had been a standard vitamin supplement for British-based German [[Prisoner of war|POW]]s during the Second World War.\n\nBy the 1990s Marmite's distinctive and powerful flavour had earned it as many detractors as it had fans, and it was known for producing a polarised \"love/hate\" reaction amongst consumers. For many years television advertisements for Marmite featured the song \"[[Low Rider]]\" by the band [[War (U.S. band)|War]] with the lyrics changed to the phrase \"My Mate, Marmite\". Marmite began a \"Love it or Hate it\" campaign during October 1996, and this resulted in the inventing of the phrase \"Marmite effect\" or \"Marmite reaction\" for anything which provoked controversy.<ref>[[Cath Kidston]], appearing on [[BBC Radio 4]]'s ''[[Desert Island Discs]]'' programme during April 2010 described her shops as provoking a 'Marmite reaction': \"People either love it and want a little bit of it very much, or want to stab us.\" {{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b010lyy4/Desert_Island_Discs_Cath_Kidston/ |title=Desert Island Discs: Cath Kidston |date=29 April 2010 |website=BBC |access-date=29 April 2011}}</ref> On 22 April 2010, Unilever threatened legal action against the [[British National Party]] for using a jar of Marmite and the \"love it or hate it\" slogan for their television advertisements.<ref>{{cite news |title=BNP facing Marmite legal action |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/election_2010/8637473.stm |access-date=22 April 2010 |website=BBC News |date=22 April 2010}}</ref>\n\n==Availability worldwide==\n[[File:Our Mate jar of UK Made Marmite Spread branded for sale in Australia.JPG|thumb|left|upright=.6|''Our Mate''&nbsp;\u2013 Marmite branded for sale in Australia and New Zealand.]]\nBecause of the local product named Marmite, it is sold by the name \"Our Mate\" in Australia and New Zealand.

Normal Marmite contains a mix of lager, bitter and ale varieties of yeast, sourced from breweries throughout the UK. However, as lagers have a lighter, sweeter taste, residue from this product is not used in Marmite XO. Only residue from traditional bitters and ales are blended to ensure the stronger taste.  Marmite XO is matured for 28 days - four times longer than usual. Continuing the tradition of different coloured caps for special editions, Marmite XO's cap is black.\n\nDuring April 2012, a special edition jar in commemoration of the [[Diamond Jubilee of Queen Elizabeth II]] was released.

Other members included bassist [[Paz Lenchantin]], of [[A Perfect Circle]], and guitarists [[David Pajo]] and [[Matt Sweeney]] of various prior bands and projects. The band released only one album, ''[[Mary Star of the Sea (album)|Mary Star of the Sea]]'', in 2003, before breaking up acrimoniously that same year during their world tour to promote the album. Following the disbanding, Corgan released a solo album, ''[[TheFutureEmbrace]]'' before reforming the Smashing Pumpkins in 2005, with Chamberlin in 2006. Despite allusions to multiple album's worth of material written by band members, no further material has surfaced beyond their only studio album, and none of the material has ever been revisited in performances by any of the members outside of a brief 2017 tour by Corgan.  In his solo shows in the summer of 2019, Corgan played \"Honestly\" and \"Endless Summer\" on his European summer tour at some dates.\n\n==History==\n\n===Formation and ''Mary Star of the Sea'' (2001-2003)===\n\nFollowing the breakup of the Smashing Pumpkins, Corgan and drummer [[Jimmy Chamberlin]] joined forces with [[Matt Sweeney]] (formerly of the bands [[Chavez (band)|Chavez]] and [[Skunk (band)|Skunk]]) to start Zwan.

Later, former [[A Perfect Circle]]'s bassist [[Paz Lenchantin]] joined the band in 2002, and Pajo was moved as their third guitarist.\n\nZwan had two different incarnations. The first, and more common version, the True Poets of Zwan (or simply \"Zwan\"), used three guitars, bass guitar and drums. Zwan's only album, ''[[Mary Star of the Sea (album)|Mary Star of the Sea]]'', is attributed to the True Poets of Zwan in the liner notes.<ref>Interview with Matt Sweeney.  ''[[Mary Star of the Sea (album)#Deluxe edition|For Your Love]]'' DVD, ''Mary Star of the Sea''</ref> Zwan is credited with being a bridge between the success of the Smashing Pumpkins in the 1990s and the further career developments and experimentations undertaken by Corgan in the 2000s, as well as his shift from his sombre, dark themes towards more hopeful lyrics in line with his spiritual development at the time.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://consequenceofsound.net/2009/04/dusting-em-off-zwan-mary-star-of-the-sea/|title=Dusting 'Em Off : Mary Star of the Sea|date=April 18, 2009|website=Consequenceofsound.net|accessdate=August 10, 2018}}</ref>\n\nDjali Zwan, an acoustic incarnation of Zwan, which also featured cellist [[Ana Lenchantin]], Paz's sister, was to film and record the making of a new album in the studio in the fall of 2003, with an album and DVD to be issued in early 2004. Corgan spoke with ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' about his plans: \"We're going to do it ''[[Let It Be (The Beatles album)|Let It Be]]''-style,\" Corgan said, referring to the documentary about the 1970 [[The Beatles|Beatles]] album. \"The album would be recorded live, with the cameras rolling. When you get the DVD, you can watch the takes on the album being done.\" He described the songs he'd written for Djali Zwan as \"more folk-driven, rooted in traditional music. I don't want to compromise veins of material to fit into an electric band, which I often did in the Pumpkins.

Other members included bassist [[Paz Lenchantin]], of [[A Perfect Circle]], and guitarists [[David Pajo]] and [[Matt Sweeney]] of various prior bands and projects. The band released only one album, ''[[Mary Star of the Sea (album)|Mary Star of the Sea]]'', in 2003, before breaking up acrimoniously that same year during their world tour to promote the album. Following the disbanding, Corgan released a solo album, ''[[TheFutureEmbrace]]'' before reforming the Smashing Pumpkins in 2005, with Chamberlin in 2006. Despite allusions to multiple album's worth of material written by band members, no further material has surfaced beyond their only studio album, and none of the material has ever been revisited in performances by any of the members outside of a brief 2017 tour by Corgan.  In his solo shows in the summer of 2019, Corgan played \"Honestly\" and \"Endless Summer\" on his European summer tour at some dates.\n\n==History==\n\n===Formation and ''Mary Star of the Sea'' (2001-2003)===\n\nFollowing the breakup of the Smashing Pumpkins, Corgan and drummer [[Jimmy Chamberlin]] joined forces with [[Matt Sweeney]] (formerly of the bands [[Chavez (band)|Chavez]] and [[Skunk (band)|Skunk]]) to start Zwan.

Later, former [[A Perfect Circle]]'s bassist [[Paz Lenchantin]] joined the band in 2002, and Pajo was moved as their third guitarist.\n\nZwan had two different incarnations. The first, and more common version, the True Poets of Zwan (or simply \"Zwan\"), used three guitars, bass guitar and drums. Zwan's only album, ''[[Mary Star of the Sea (album)|Mary Star of the Sea]]'', is attributed to the True Poets of Zwan in the liner notes.<ref>Interview with Matt Sweeney.  ''[[Mary Star of the Sea (album)#Deluxe edition|For Your Love]]'' DVD, ''Mary Star of the Sea''</ref> Zwan is credited with being a bridge between the success of the Smashing Pumpkins in the 1990s and the further career developments and experimentations undertaken by Corgan in the 2000s, as well as his shift from his sombre, dark themes towards more hopeful lyrics in line with his spiritual development at the time.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://consequenceofsound.net/2009/04/dusting-em-off-zwan-mary-star-of-the-sea/|title=Dusting 'Em Off : Mary Star of the Sea|date=April 18, 2009|website=Consequenceofsound.net|accessdate=August 10, 2018}}</ref>\n\nDjali Zwan, an acoustic incarnation of Zwan, which also featured cellist [[Ana Lenchantin]], Paz's sister, was to film and record the making of a new album in the studio in the fall of 2003, with an album and DVD to be issued in early 2004. Corgan spoke with ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' about his plans: \"We're going to do it ''[[Let It Be (The Beatles album)|Let It Be]]''-style,\" Corgan said, referring to the documentary about the 1970 [[The Beatles|Beatles]] album. \"The album would be recorded live, with the cameras rolling. When you get the DVD, you can watch the takes on the album being done.\" He described the songs he'd written for Djali Zwan as \"more folk-driven, rooted in traditional music. I don't want to compromise veins of material to fit into an electric band, which I often did in the Pumpkins.

I mean, that's the kind of stuff we were dealing with.}}\n\nPajo denied Corgan's accusations in the same article.  \"Pretty much everything that he said has been exaggerated and blown out of proportion,\" he said. \"The drug stuff in particular. I know there was sex but no heroin.\" Adds Lenchantin, \"I believe that we were a really good team. I am moving on and onward. I hope that our paths will meet again in peace.\"\n\nIn the same ''Entertainment Weekly'' article, Corgan disclosed that things went wrong at some of the very first recording sessions.  \"...it was like, 'What do you mean the guitar's out of tune? What do you mean I have to be there at 11? What do you mean I can't order $100 of [[lobster]] every day?' I mean, like, bad. But it was too late. It was already public. The album was going out.
