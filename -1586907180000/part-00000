Its modern development began in the late 19th century with the vogue for the first health resorts. In the early 20th century Portoro\u017e became one of the grandest seaside resorts in [[Adriatic sea|Adriatic]], along with [[Opatija|Abbazia]], [[Lido di Venezia|Lido]] and [[Grado, Friuli-Venezia Giulia|Grado]], then as part of the [[Austrian Littoral]].<ref>http://www.istrabenz.si/slo/turizem/950</ref> It is now one of Slovenia's major tourist areas.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.piran.si/index.php?page=static&item=1&tree_root=1 |title=Piran Municipality site|accessdate=2012-01-31|ref=harv}}</ref> Located in the centre is the [[Kempinski Palace Portoro\u017e|Hotel Palace]], once one of the most important resorts for the [[Austro-Hungarian monarchy]], and currently one of the finest hotels between [[Venice]] and [[Dubrovnik]].<ref>http://www.erevija.com/clanek/1131/Hotel_Palace_-_Portoro\u017e {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304223001/http://www.erevija.com/clanek/1131/Hotel_Palace_-_Portoro%C5%BE |date=2016-03-04 }}</ref>\n\nThe settlement and its surrounding areas are served by [[Portoro\u017e Airport|Portoro\u017e International Airport]] which is located in the nearby village of [[Se\u010dovlje]].\n\n== History ==\nThe history of the settlement is directly connected to that of the neighbouring town of [[Piran]], with [[illyrians|Illyrian]] settlers already living there in the prehistoric era. They were followed by [[Celts|Celtic]] tribes, which were later conquered and annexed by the [[Roman Empire]] in 178 B.C. Archaeological finds suggest that in this period many farms and villas, also named ''villae rusticae'', were built in the area. A large development of the area followed only after the demise of the empire, with enlargement of the number of settlers seeking shelter from attacks by the [[Barbarians]].\n\nIn the 7th century, the area was a part of the [[Byzantine Empire]]. Due to increasing dissatisfaction with the feudal rule, as well as the rising power of the [[Venetian Republic]], the settlement of Pirano signed a trade treaty with [[Venice]], which included a lesser degree of autonomy.\n\n[[File:Postcard of Portoro\u017e 1912 (3).jpg|thumb|left|Portoro\u017e in 1912]]\nOne of the first religious orders who came to this area was the [[Order of Saint Benedict|Benedictines]]. \nIn the 12th century, the broader region already had four monasteries and even more churches. Among those, one of the oldest was the church of ''Our Lady of the Rosary'', which stood by the bay in the beginnings of the 13th century. Its name was ''Sancta Maria Roxe'' or ''S. Maria delle Rose'', and in 1251 the bay was named by it ''Portus sanctae Mariae de Rosa''.\n\nOne of the most important roles in the history of the settlement was the monastery of Saint Laurence, where the Benedictines healed rheumatic illnesses, ascites and other diseases with concentrated saltwater and saline mud. In 1210, the area was overtaken by the Patriarchy of Aquileia.\n\nIn the 13th century, Pirano entered a brief war from December 1282 to January 1283, in which it was defeated by the Venetian Republic. [[File:Razglednica Portoro\u017ea 1915 (3).jpg|thumb|right|250px|upright|Portoro\u017e's bath in 1915]]\n\nDuring the second Venetian rule, it was, contrary to other towns on the [[Istria]]n peninsula, loyal to Venetian rule, and as such gained special privileges within the republic, which in turn caused the local economy to boom. In 1797, Venetian rule came to a close as the [[Austrian Empire]] took over the area for a brief period until 1806. From 1806 to 1813, the entire Istrian Peninsula became part of the [[Illyrian Provinces]].\n\nA period of economic growth followed during the second Austrian rule, with enlargement of trade and locally important salt pans in nearby [[Lucija]] and [[Se\u010dovlje]]. In the aftermath of the [[World War I|Great War]], the [[Treaty of Rapallo (1920)|Treaty of Rapallo]] determined the Istrian peninsula to be from that point on a part of the [[Kingdom of Italy]].\n\nUnder the royal and then fascist rule, the area found itself amidst economic decline and civil conflicts between the populace and the state. In [[World War II]], the area had not seen much action, although the important industrial hub of Trieste suffered multiple bombings. In the aftermath of the war, the settlement found itself in the [[United Nations]]-administered [[Free Territory of Trieste]]. After the dissolution of the Trieste state it became a part of [[Socialist Federative Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.piran-pirano.si/zgodovina/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-06-25 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140810055511/http://www.piran-pirano.si/zgodovina/ |archivedate=2014-08-10 }}</ref>\n\n== Economy ==\n\nThe economy of Portoro\u017e is mainly based on tourism and the [[casino|gambling industry]]. The facilities include a marina,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.marinap.si/ |title=Marina Portoro\u017e site|accessdate=2012-12-30|ref=harv}}</ref> numerous sporting facilities and several casinos, along with many hotels and apartment complexes.\n\n===Tourism development===\nIn the second half of the 19th century, the leaders of the [[Pirano]] municipality and local doctors decided to stimulate tourism in the region, by offering health treatment by concentrated salt water and salina mud, and from 1879 onwards Dr. [[Giovanni Lugnano]] the first to offer such treatment to various visitors.\nIn 1885 after several years of successful start of a new branch of industry, constructions of new complexes and villas began, and in 1890 the predecessor of the famous Hotel Palace was built. Among the new settlers were various prominent figures, such as Antonelli, Dragovina, Furian, Frennez, Langer, Rastelli, Reinlaner and Salvetti.\nBecause of the new branch of healthcare treatment that emerged in ''Porto Rose'', the ministry of interior affairs declared the settlement to be a health resort.\nIn 1908 Dr. [[Orazio Pupini]], a prominent Austrian doctor with a noticeable treatment history opened a sanatorium. He was also the main doctor of the Austrian Railways, and a member of the Austrian Doctors\u2019 Association.\nIn 1902 The [[Parenzana]] Railway system was introduced which increased the popularity of the region, but was later dissolved because of decreased interests.[[File:Portoro\u017e 1957.jpg|thumb|left|upright|240px|Palace Hotel in 1957]]\nIn 1909 the era of construction of private villas ended with opening of a much bigger building for standards at the time; the ''Palace Cur Hotel'', later known as [[Palace Hotel, Portoro\u017e|Palace Hotel]]. At the initial opening ceremony, in 1910, the Hotel Palace was already named \u00bbthe most beautiful hotel on the [[Adriatic Sea|Adriatic]] coast\u00ab. The hotel was equipped with the most modern therapeutic accessories, and for the needs of high importance guests a casino was built.\n\nThe thriving community was halted by World War I, and a few years after the war (In which they came under the [[Italy|Italian rule]]) in 1928 they included a new electric therapy among their treatment programmes. In the whole interwar period the settlement was slowly regaining its former glory when World War II  severely crippled it again. The crisis lasted until 1968 when renovations and new constructions under the new entity of [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] began to take place along the whole region. In this time they began to build the settlement's infrastructure with the casino doing the bulk of the investments in reconstructing the [[Portoro\u017e Airport|sports airfield]] in nearby [[Se\u010dovlje]] and building the multi-purpose [[Avditorij Portoro\u017e|auditorium]] in 1972. In 1976 two hotel complexes were constructed in Bernardin, in the following year another was added in the same area.<ref name=\"slovensko-morje.net\">{{cite web|url=http://slovensko-morje.net/index.php?page%3Dnews%26view_news%3D5401 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-06-25 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150609043918/http://slovensko-morje.net/index.php?page=news |archivedate=2015-06-09 }}</ref> In the same year they began transforming the [[Lucija, Piran|Lucija saltworks]] into a marina for smaller vessels.<ref name=\"svet24.si\">http://svet24.si/clanek/526942816c4f9/kaj-najbolj-zaznamuje-portoroz</ref>  Since the secession of [[Slovenian War of Independence|Slovenia]] from Yugoslavia, Portoro\u017e became one of the most important tourist sites in the country.<ref>http://www.piran.si/index.php?item=138&page=static</ref>\n<ref>http://www.angelfire.com/biz/mareaslo/zgod.html {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160602034758/http://www.angelfire.com/biz/mareaslo/zgod.html |date=2016-06-02 }}</ref>\n\n===Gambling===\nThe first casino to be opened was in Villa San Lorenzo, on 27 July 1913, and was run by the ''Casino des Etrangers'' society. It only lasted briefly for not more than a few months before being shut down.[[File:Portoroz (10) (3955614179).jpg|thumb|right|220px|Hotel Palace in present day]]\nThe industry faded away in the northern Adriatic region, until 1963, when ''Zavod za pospe\u0161evanje turizma'', whose president was Anton Nino Spinelli, proposed a reopening of the casino. The next year the first casino in the [[Socialist Republic of Slovenia]], and the second within [[SFRY|Yugoslavia]] beside the one in [[Opatija]] opened. In 1972, the company moved into the newly built and much larger [[Grand hotel Metropol]], where they employed around 450 people. Having a large budget surplus, they began investing in the settlement's infrastructure.<ref name=\"svet24.si\"/>\nToday there are multiple casinos located in Portoro\u017e, such as [[Casino Riviera]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.casino-riviera.si/pc.asp?xpath%3D%26xpathid%3D%26lang%3Dslo |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-06-25 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714155409/http://www.casino-riviera.si/pc.asp?xpath=&xpathid=&lang=slo |archivedate=2014-07-14 }}</ref> [[Grand Casino (Portoro\u017e)|Grand Casino]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bernardingroup.si/si/metropol-resort/hoteli/grand-hotel-metropol/casino |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-06-25 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140618174650/http://www.bernardingroup.si/si/metropol-resort/hoteli/grand-hotel-metropol/casino |archivedate=2014-06-18 }}</ref> and [[Casino Bernardin]], located in the town's hotel complex of Bernardin.<ref>http://www.casino-bernardin.si/</ref>\n\n===Bernardin===\nBernardin is a tourist complex located in the western part of Portoro\u017e.

In the early 20th century Portoro\u017e became one of the grandest seaside resorts in [[Adriatic sea|Adriatic]], along with [[Opatija|Abbazia]], [[Lido di Venezia|Lido]] and [[Grado, Friuli-Venezia Giulia|Grado]], then as part of the [[Austrian Littoral]].<ref>http://www.istrabenz.si/slo/turizem/950</ref> It is now one of Slovenia's major tourist areas.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.piran.si/index.php?page=static&item=1&tree_root=1 |title=Piran Municipality site|accessdate=2012-01-31|ref=harv}}</ref> Located in the centre is the [[Kempinski Palace Portoro\u017e|Hotel Palace]], once one of the most important resorts for the [[Austro-Hungarian monarchy]], and currently one of the finest hotels between [[Venice]] and [[Dubrovnik]].<ref>http://www.erevija.com/clanek/1131/Hotel_Palace_-_Portoro\u017e {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304223001/http://www.erevija.com/clanek/1131/Hotel_Palace_-_Portoro%C5%BE |date=2016-03-04 }}</ref>\n\nThe settlement and its surrounding areas are served by [[Portoro\u017e Airport|Portoro\u017e International Airport]] which is located in the nearby village of [[Se\u010dovlje]].\n\n== History ==\nThe history of the settlement is directly connected to that of the neighboring town of [[Piran]], with [[illyrians|Illyrian]] settlers already living there in the prehistoric era. They were followed by [[Celts|Celtic]] tribes, which were later conquered and annexed by the [[Roman Empire]] in 178 B.C. Archaeological finds suggest that in this period many farms and villas, also named ''villae rusticae'', were built in the area.  A large development of the area followed only after the demise of the empire, with enlargement of the number of settlers seeking shelter from attacks by the [[Barbarians]].\n\nIn the 7th century the area was a part of the [[Byzantine empire]]. Due to increasing dissatisfaction with the feudal rule, as well as rising power of the [[Venetian Republic]], the settlement of Pirano signed a trade treaty with [[Venice]], which included a lesser degree of autonomy.\n\n[[File:Postcard of Portoro\u017e 1912 (3).jpg|thumb|left|Portoro\u017e in 1912]]\nOne of the first religious orders who came to this area were the [[Order of Saint Benedict|Benedictines]]. \nIn the 12th century, the broader region already had four monasteries, and even more churches. Among those, one of the oldest was the church of ''Our Lady of the Rosary'', which stood by the bay in the beginnings of the 13th century. Its name was ''Sancta Maria Roxe'' or ''S. Maria delle Rose'', and in 1251 the bay was named by it ''Portus sanctae Mariae de Rosa''.\n\nOne of the most important roles in the history of the settlement was the monastery of Saint Laurence, where the Benedictines healed rheumatic illnesses, ascites and other diseases with concentrated salt water and saline mud. In the 1210 the area was overtaken by the Patriarchy of Aquileia.\n\nIn the 13th century Pirano entered a brief war from December 1282 to January 1283 in which it was defeated by the Venetian Republic. [[File:Razglednica Portoro\u017ea 1915 (3).jpg|thumb|right|250px|upright|Portoro\u017e's bath in 1915]]\n\nDuring the second Venetian rule, it was, contrary to other towns on the [[Istria]]n peninsula, loyal to Venetian rule, and as such gained special privileges within the republic, which in turn caused the local economy to boom. In 1797 Venetian rule came to a close as the [[Austrian Empire]] took over the area for a brief period until 1806. From 1806 to 1813 the entire Istrian Peninsula became part of the [[Illyrian Provinces]].\n\nA period of economic growth followed during the second Austrian rule, with enlargement of trade and locally important salt pans in nearby [[Lucija]] and [[Se\u010dovlje]]. In the aftermath of the [[World War I|Great War]], the [[Treaty of Rapallo (1920)|Treaty of Rapallo]] determined the Istrian peninsula to be from that point on a part of the [[Kingdom of Italy]].\n\nUnder the royal and then fascist rule, the area found itself amidst economic decline and civil conflicts between the populace and the state. In [[World War II]], the area hadn't seen much action, although the important industrial hub of Trieste suffered multiple bombings. In the aftermath of the war, the settlement found itself in the [[United Nations]]-administered [[Free Territory of Trieste]]. After the dissolution of the Trieste state it became a part of [[Socialist Federative Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.piran-pirano.si/zgodovina/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-06-25 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140810055511/http://www.piran-pirano.si/zgodovina/ |archivedate=2014-08-10 }}</ref>\n\n== Economy ==\n\nThe economy of Portoro\u017e is mainly based on tourism and the [[casino|gambling industry]]. The facilities include a marina,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.marinap.si/ |title=Marina Portoro\u017e site|accessdate=2012-12-30|ref=harv}}</ref> numerous sporting facilities and several casinos, along with many hotels and apartment complexes.\n\n===Tourism development===\nIn the second half of the 19th century, the leaders of the [[Pirano]] municipality and local doctors decided to stimulate tourism in the region, by offering health treatment by concentrated salt water and salina mud, and from 1879 onwards Dr. [[Giovanni Lugnano]] the first to offer such treatment to various visitors.\nIn 1885 after several years of successful start of a new branch of industry, constructions of new complexes and villas began, and in 1890 the predecessor of the famous Hotel Palace was built. Among the new settlers were various prominent figures, such as Antonelli, Dragovina, Furian, Frennez, Langer, Rastelli, Reinlaner and Salvetti.\nBecause of the new branch of healthcare treatment that emerged in ''Porto Rose'', the ministry of interior affairs declared the settlement to be a health resort.\nIn 1908 Dr. [[Orazio Pupini]], a prominent Austrian doctor with a noticeable treatment history opened a sanatorium. He was also the main doctor of the Austrian Railways, and a member of the Austrian Doctors\u2019 Association.\nIn 1902 The [[Parenzana]] Railway system was introduced which increased the popularity of the region, but was later dissolved because of decreased interests.[[File:Portoro\u017e 1957.jpg|thumb|left|upright|240px|Palace Hotel in 1957]]\nIn 1909 the era of construction of private villas ended with opening of a much bigger building for standards at the time; the ''Palace Cur Hotel'', later known as [[Palace Hotel, Portoro\u017e|Palace Hotel]]. At the initial opening ceremony, in 1910, the Hotel Palace was already named \u00bbthe most beautiful hotel on the [[Adriatic Sea|Adriatic]] coast\u00ab. The hotel was equipped with the most modern therapeutic accessories, and for the needs of high importance guests a casino was built.\n\nThe thriving community was halted by World War I, and a few years after the war (In which they came under the [[Italy|Italian rule]]) in 1928 they included a new electric therapy among their treatment programmes. In the whole interwar period the settlement was slowly regaining its former glory when World War II  severely crippled it again. The crisis lasted until 1968 when renovations and new constructions under the new entity of [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] began to take place along the whole region. In this time they began to build the settlement's infrastructure with the casino doing the bulk of the investments in reconstructing the [[Portoro\u017e Airport|sports airfield]] in nearby [[Se\u010dovlje]] and building the multi-purpose [[Avditorij Portoro\u017e|auditorium]] in 1972. In 1976 two hotel complexes were constructed in Bernardin, in the following year another was added in the same area.<ref name=\"slovensko-morje.net\">{{cite web|url=http://slovensko-morje.net/index.php?page%3Dnews%26view_news%3D5401 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-06-25 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150609043918/http://slovensko-morje.net/index.php?page=news |archivedate=2015-06-09 }}</ref> In the same year they began transforming the [[Lucija, Piran|Lucija saltworks]] into a marina for smaller vessels.<ref name=\"svet24.si\">http://svet24.si/clanek/526942816c4f9/kaj-najbolj-zaznamuje-portoroz</ref>  Since the secession of [[Slovenian War of Independence|Slovenia]] from Yugoslavia, Portoro\u017e became one of the most important tourist sites in the country.<ref>http://www.piran.si/index.php?item=138&page=static</ref>\n<ref>http://www.angelfire.com/biz/mareaslo/zgod.html {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160602034758/http://www.angelfire.com/biz/mareaslo/zgod.html |date=2016-06-02 }}</ref>\n\n===Gambling===\nThe first casino to be opened was in Villa San Lorenzo, on 27 July 1913, and was run by the ''Casino des Etrangers'' society. It only lasted briefly for not more than a few months before being shut down.[[File:Portoroz (10) (3955614179).jpg|thumb|right|220px|Hotel Palace in present day]]\nThe industry faded away in the northern Adriatic region, until 1963, when ''Zavod za pospe\u0161evanje turizma'', whose president was Anton Nino Spinelli, proposed a reopening of the casino. The next year the first casino in the [[Socialist Republic of Slovenia]], and the second within [[SFRY|Yugoslavia]] beside the one in [[Opatija]] opened. In 1972, the company moved into the newly built and much larger [[Grand hotel Metropol]], where they employed around 450 people.

These were subsequently labelled as primary and secondary psychopaths.<ref name=\"four\" />\n\n=== Primary Psychopathy ===\nThe subtype known as \"primary\" psychopathy refers to individuals who are completely rational, lack anxiety and have high levels of interpersonal charm. Whilst these behaviours appear incredibly adaptive, primary psychopaths are also prone to dysfunctional and pathological traits such as an inability to learn from past mistakes and a lack of responsibility.<ref name=\"four\">{{cite journal |last1=Vaughn |first1=Michael G. |last2=Edens |first2=John F. |last3=Howard |first3=Matthew O. |last4=Smith |first4=Shannon Toney |title=An Investigation of Primary and Secondary Psychopathy in a Statewide Sample of Incarcerated Youth |journal=Youth Violence and Juvenile Injustice |date=July 2009 |volume=7 |issue=3 |page=173 |doi=10.1177/1541204009333792 |url=https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1541204009333792?journalCode=yvja |accessdate=10 April 2020}}</ref> \n\n=== Secondary Psychopathy ===\n\"Secondary\" psychopaths are individuals not dissimilar to primary psychopaths in the sense that they still share many of the same characteristics and traits. However, unlike the primary psychopath, the secondary psychopath is more likely to suffer from intense emotional arousal and psychological issues. As well as this, research conducted on adult psychopaths has suggested that secondary psychopaths are more prone to take part in destructive behaviour including drug abuse, suicide and interpersonal aggression. Overall, what differentiates secondary psychopaths from primary psychopaths is their reactivity, an inability to control their emotions effectively and increased impulsivity.<ref name=\"four\" />\n\n=== Evaluation ===\nStudies have supported the existence of these two subgroups. For example, after a [[questionnaire]] assessing personality was distributed to 96 male psychopathic male prisoners, the researchers conducting the study concluded the best-fitting model for the differences in personality was two separate groups. One group was labelled \"emotionally stable psychopaths\" and the other was labelled \"aggressive psychopaths\". The aggressive psychopaths were more emotionally reactive and lacked control whereas the emotionally stable psychopaths had high levels of achievement and social skills and low levels of stress reaction. <ref>{{cite journal |last1=Hicks |first1=Brian M. |last2=Markon |first2=Kristian E. |last3=Patrick |first3=Christopher J. |last4=Krueger |first4=Rober F. |last5=Newman |first5=Joseph P. |title=Identifying Psychopathy Subtypes on the Basis of Personality Structure |journal=The American Psychological Association |date=2004 |volume=16 |issue=3 |pages=276-281 |doi=10.1037/1040-3590.16.3.276 |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15456383 |accessdate=10 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n== Development and Scoring ==\nThe LSRP was based off of [[Robert D.

Hare's]] diagnostic [[Psychopathy Checklist-Revised]] (PCL-R) and consists of 26 statements which participants must decide their attitudes towards using a 4-point [[Likert scale]] (\"disagree strongly\", \"disagree somewhat\", \"agree somewhat\" and \"agree strongly\"). Seven of the items were reversed to reduce [[response bias]].<ref name=\"two\">{{cite journal |last1=Brinkley |first1=Chad A. |last2=Schmitt |first2=William A. |last3=Smith |first3=Steven S. |last4=Newman |first4=Joseph P. |title=Construct validation of a self-report psychopathy scale: does Levenson's self-report psychopathy scale measure the same constructs as Hare's psychopathy checklist-revised? |journal=Personality and Individual Differences |date=28 September 2000 |volume=31 |issue=7 |page=1025 |doi=10.1016/S0191-8869(00)00178-1 |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191886900001781?casa_token=Jj9Lqy7hp4kAAAAA:BeI10XjTH0hugvfpD6HWvDOqFhekT1TZfzg6hMQNkhYyDGdn7s4wE43PsxntcOWUY6LSNhhQqYA |accessdate=11 April 2020}}</ref> \n\nA [[factor analysis]] was initially conducted on the items in the LSRP and two factors (primary and secondary psychopathy) were derived from the scale.<ref name=\"two\" />16 of the statements from the scale determined primary psychopathy and the remaining 10 determined secondary psychopathy. The statements that were attributed to primary psychopathy were more to do with manipulation and a lack of empathy whereas the statements attributed to secondary psychopathy were focused on behavioural issues.<ref name=\"one\" />{{rp|152-153}}\n\nBased on the results of the initial study, the following thresholds for the results were established: \n\n* 0-48: Non-psychopathic group\n* 49-57: Mixed group\n* \u226558: Psychopathic group<ref name=\"two\" />\n\n== Limitations ==\n\n=== [[Validity (statistics)|Validity]] ===\n==== [[Construct validity]] ====\n\nThe LSRP intends to measure the same constructs as the PCL-R. Significant correlations suggest that the LSRP does correlate with the PCL-R for both factors of psychopathy. However, these correlations were small to moderate so suggest that the LSRP and PCL-R are measuring somewhat different constructs.<ref name=\"two\" />\n==== Internal validity ====\n\nThe LSRP suffers much of the same problems as other self-reported data. As the participant is completing the form themselves, they are more likely to be subject to biases that can change how they answer questions and thus jeopardise the [[internal validity]] of the data. An example of such is the [[recall bias]] in which participants must recall what they believe to be relevant information to complete the self-report. However, without the presence of an interviewer who is able to guide the participants thought process, the participant may be using incorrect information that they called upon to answer a question. The potential for this problem is much higher in self-reported data than interviews.<ref name= \"three\">{{cite journal |last1=Bowling |first1=Ann |title=Mode of questionnaire administration can have serious effects on data quality |journal=Journal of Public Health |date=3 May 2005 |volume=27 |issue=3 |pages=281-287 |doi=10.1093/pubmed/fdi031 |url=https://academic.oup.com/jpubhealth/article/27/3/281/1511097 |accessdate=11 April 2020}}</ref> \n\nThe [[cognitive]] burden of self-reported data is also higher than interviews. The LSRP, being a visual questionnaire, requires literacy skills, a lack of visual impairment and ability to use your hands as well as the ability to follow instructions. Compared to interviews, this increased cognitive burden could result in a lower quality of data.<ref name= \"three\" />\n\n==== External validity ====\n\nTo create the LSRP, Levenson et al. only used undergraduate students studying psychology at a specific university. This is an example of [[selection bias]] and is likely to have negative implications for the [[external validity]] of the scale as the wider population does not consist of only undergraduate students.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Fritz |first1=Kyra N. |last2=Lim |first2=Nicholas K. |title=The SAGE Encyclopedia of Educational Research, Measurement, and Evaluation |date=2018 |publisher=SAGE Publications, Inc. |location=Thousand Oaks |isbn=9781506326139 |pages=1490-1491 |url=https://methods.sagepub.com/reference/the-sage-encyclopedia-of-educational-research-measurement-and-evaluation/i18601.xml?fromsearch=true |accessdate=12 April 2020 |chapter=Selection Bias}}</ref> The development of the LSRP also used a WEIRD sample. This refers to a sample from a western, educated, industrialised, rich, democratic society. The problem with this is that due to the restricted sample, the LSRP may not be generalisable to the other 88% of the population who do not live in WEIRD societies, once again decreasing the external validity of the scale. <ref>{{cite journal |last1=Henrich |first1=Joseph |last2=Heine |first2=Steven J. |last3=Norenzayan |first3=Ara |title=The weirdest people in the world? |journal=Behavioural and Brain Sciences |date=2010 |volume=33 |issue=2-3 |page=3 |doi=10.1017/S0140525X0999152X |url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/behavioral-and-brain-sciences/article/weirdest-people-in-the-world/BF84F7517D56AFF7B7EB58411A554C17 |accessdate=12 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n=== Reliability ===\n\n==== Internal consistency reliability ====\nFindings on the [[internal consistency]] [[Reliability (statistics)|reliability]] of the LSRP are mixed.

Whilst these behaviours appear incredibly adaptive, primary psychopaths are also prone to dysfunctional and pathological traits such as an inability to learn from past mistakes and a lack of responsibility.<ref name=\"four\">{{cite journal |last1=Vaughn |first1=Michael G. |last2=Edens |first2=John F. |last3=Howard |first3=Matthew O. |last4=Smith |first4=Shannon Toney |title=An Investigation of Primary and Secondary Psychopathy in a Statewide Sample of Incarcerated Youth |journal=Youth Violence and Juvenile Injustice |date=July 2009 |volume=7 |issue=3 |page=173 |doi=10.1177/1541204009333792 |url=https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1541204009333792?journalCode=yvja |accessdate=10 April 2020}}</ref> \n\n=== Secondary Psychopathy ===\n\"Secondary\" psychopaths are individuals not dissimilar to primary psychopaths in the sense that they still share many of the same characteristics and traits. However, unlike the primary psychopath, the secondary psychopath is more likely to suffer from intense emotional arousal and psychological issues. As well as this, research conducted on adult psychopaths has suggested that secondary psychopaths are more prone to take part in destructive behaviour including drug abuse, suicide and interpersonal aggression. Overall, what differentiates secondary psychopaths from primary psychopaths is their reactivity, an inability to control their emotions effectively and increased impulsivity.<ref name=\"four\" />\n\n=== Evaluation ===\nStudies have supported the existence of these two subgroups. For example, after a [[questionnaire]] assessing personality was distributed to 96 male psychopathic male prisoners, the researchers conducting the study concluded the best-fitting model for the differences in personality was two separate groups. One group was labelled \"emotionally stable psychopaths\" and the other was labelled \"aggressive psychopaths\". The aggressive psychopaths were more emotionally reactive and lacked control whereas the emotionally stable psychopaths had high levels of achievement and social skills and low levels of stress reaction. <ref>{{cite journal |last1=Hicks |first1=Brian M. |last2=Markon |first2=Kristian E. |last3=Patrick |first3=Christopher J. |last4=Krueger |first4=Rober F. |last5=Newman |first5=Joseph P. |title=Identifying Psychopathy Subtypes on the Basis of Personality Structure |journal=The American Psychological Association |date=2004 |volume=16 |issue=3 |pages=276-281 |doi=10.1037/1040-3590.16.3.276 |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15456383 |accessdate=10 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n== Development and Scoring ==\nThe LSRP was based off of [[Robert D.

Seven of the items were reversed to reduce [[response bias]].<ref name=\"two\">{{cite journal |last1=Brinkley |first1=Chad A. |last2=Schmitt |first2=William A. |last3=Smith |first3=Steven S. |last4=Newman |first4=Joseph P. |title=Construct validation of a self-report psychopathy scale: does Levenson's self-report psychopathy scale measure the same constructs as Hare's psychopathy checklist-revised? |journal=Personality and Individual Differences |date=28 September 2000 |volume=31 |issue=7 |page=1025 |doi=10.1016/S0191-8869(00)00178-1 |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191886900001781?casa_token=Jj9Lqy7hp4kAAAAA:BeI10XjTH0hugvfpD6HWvDOqFhekT1TZfzg6hMQNkhYyDGdn7s4wE43PsxntcOWUY6LSNhhQqYA |accessdate=11 April 2020}}</ref> \n\nA [[factor analysis]] was initially conducted on the items in the LSRP and two factors (primary and secondary psychopathy) were derived from the scale.<ref name=\"two\" />16 of the statements from the scale determined primary psychopathy and the remaining 10 determined secondary psychopathy. The statements that were attributed to primary psychopathy were more to do with manipulation and a lack of empathy whereas the statements attributed to secondary psychopathy were focused on behavioural issues.<ref name=\"one\" />\n\nBased on the results of the initial study, the following thresholds for the results were established: \n\n* 0-48: Non-psychopathic group\n* 49-57: Mixed group\n* \u226558: Psychopathic group<ref name=\"two\" />\n\n== Limitations ==\n\n=== [[Validity (statistics)|Validity]] ===\n==== [[Construct validity]] ====\n\nThe LSRP intends to measure the same constructs as the PCL-R. Significant correlations suggest that the LSRP does correlate with the PCL-R for both factors of psychopathy. However, these correlations were small to moderate so suggest that the LSRP and PCL-R are measuring somewhat different constructs.<ref name=\"two\" />\n==== Internal validity ====\n\nThe LSRP suffers much of the same problems as other self-reported data. As the participant is completing the form themselves, they are more likely to be subject to biases that can change how they answer questions and thus jeopardise the [[internal validity]] of the data. An example of such is the [[recall bias]] in which participants must recall what they believe to be relevant information to complete the self-report. However, without the presence of an interviewer who is able to guide the participants thought process, the participant may be using incorrect information that they called upon to answer a question. The potential for this problem is much higher in self-reported data than interviews.<ref name= \"three\">{{cite journal |last1=Bowling |first1=Ann |title=Mode of questionnaire administration can have serious effects on data quality |journal=Journal of Public Health |date=3 May 2005 |volume=27 |issue=3 |pages=281-287 |doi=10.1093/pubmed/fdi031 |url=https://academic.oup.com/jpubhealth/article/27/3/281/1511097 |accessdate=11 April 2020}}</ref> \n\nThe [[cognitive]] burden of self-reported data is also higher than interviews. The LSRP, being a visual questionnaire, requires literacy skills, a lack of visual impairment and ability to use your hands as well as the ability to follow instructions. Compared to interviews, this increased cognitive burden could result in a lower quality of data.<ref name= \"three\" />\n\n==== External validity ====\n\nTo create the LSRP, Levenson et al. only used undergraduate students studying psychology at a specific university. This is an example of [[selection bias]] and is likely to have negative implications for the [[external validity]] of the scale as the wider population does not consist of only undergraduate students.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Fritz |first1=Kyra N. |last2=Lim |first2=Nicholas K. |title=The SAGE Encyclopedia of Educational Research, Measurement, and Evaluation |date=2018 |publisher=SAGE Publications, Inc. |location=Thousand Oaks |isbn=9781506326139 |pages=1490-1491 |url=https://methods.sagepub.com/reference/the-sage-encyclopedia-of-educational-research-measurement-and-evaluation/i18601.xml?fromsearch=true |accessdate=12 April 2020 |chapter=Selection Bias}}</ref> The development of the LSRP also used a WEIRD sample. This refers to a sample from a western, educated, industrialised, rich, democratic society. The problem with this is that due to the restricted sample, the LSRP may not be generalisable to the other 88% of the population who do not live in WEIRD societies, once again decreasing the external validity of the scale. <ref>{{cite journal |last1=Henrich |first1=Joseph |last2=Heine |first2=Steven J. |last3=Norenzayan |first3=Ara |title=The weirdest people in the world? |journal=Behavioural and Brain Sciences |date=2010 |volume=33 |issue=2-3 |page=3 |doi=10.1017/S0140525X0999152X |url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/behavioral-and-brain-sciences/article/weirdest-people-in-the-world/BF84F7517D56AFF7B7EB58411A554C17 |accessdate=12 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n=== Reliability ===\n\n==== Internal consistency reliability ====\nFindings on the [[internal consistency]] [[Reliability (statistics)|reliability]] of the LSRP are mixed.

Thus this Ahasuerus is commonly identified with Astyages. He is alternatively identified, together with the Ahasuerus of the Book of Tobit, as Cyaxares I, said to be the father of Astyages. Views differ on how to reconcile the sources in this case. One view is that the description of Ahasuerus as the \"father\" of Darius the Mede should be understood in the broader sense of \"forebear\" or \"ancestor.\" Another view notes that on the [[Behistun Inscription]], \"Cyaxares\" is a family name, and thus considers the description as literal, viewing Astyages as an intermediate ruler wrongly placed in the family line in the Greek sources.\n\nMost scholars view Darius the Mede as a literary fiction.{{sfn|Hill|2009|p=114}}\n\n===Book of Tobit===\nIn some versions of the [[deuterocanon]]ical Book of Tobit, Ahasuerus is given as the name of an associate of [[Nebuchadrezzar II|Nebuchadnezzar]], who together with him, destroyed [[Nineveh]] just before Tobit's death.<ref>Book of Tobit, 14:15.</ref>  A traditional [[Catholic]] view is that he is identical to the Ahasuerus of Daniel 9:1<ref>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02005c.htm Maas, Anthony (1907).

Herodotus also mentions that Xerxes I sought comfort in his [[harem]] following his [[Battle of Salamis|defeat at Salamis]] in the tenth month of his seventh year as king,{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}} which is strikingly similar to the date of Ahasuerus choosing beautiful women from his harem in the tenth month of his seventh year as king (Esther 2:16).\n# Annals from the reign of Xerxes I mention an otherwise unattested official by the name of \"Marduka\", which some have proposed refers to Mordecai, as both are mentioned serving in the king's court.\n\nHowever, the Septuagint, the Vulgate, the [[Midrash]] of ''Esther Rabbah, I, 3'' and the [[Josippon]] identify the king as [[Artaxerxes I]], and the historian [[Josephus]] relates that this was the name by which he was known to the Greeks.<ref>[http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=967&letter=A Ahasuerus] at the JewishEncyclopedia.com</ref> The [[Ethiopia|Ethiopic]] text calls him ''Ar\u0165eksis'', usually the Ethiopic equivalent of ''Artaxerxes''.\n\n===Book of Ezra===\n[[File:Rembrandt Harmensz van Rijn - Ahasuerus, Haman and Esther - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|''Ahasuerus and [[Haman (Bible)|Haman]] at [[Ahasuerus and Haman at the Feast of Esther|Esther's Feast]]'', by [[Rembrandt]]]]\nAhasuerus is also given as the name of a [[King of Persia]] in the [[Book of Ezra]].<ref>{{bibleref|Ezra|4:5-7}}</ref> Modern commentators associate him with [[Xerxes I]] who reigned from 486 BC until 465 BC. Other identifications have been made for [[Cambyses II]]<ref>Gill's Exposition of the Whole Bible, as quoted by Bible.cc/ezra/4-7.htm</ref> or with [[Bardiya]] (Greek ''Smerdis'') who reigned (perhaps as an imposter) for seven months between Cambyses II and [[Darius I]].<ref>Clarke's Commentary on the Bible, as quoted by Bible.cc/ezra/4-7.htm</ref>\n\n===Book of Daniel===\n[[File:Gentileschi, Artemisia - Esther before Ahasuerus - c. 1628\u20131635.jpg|thumb|''[[Esther before Ahasuerus (Artemisia Gentileschi)|Esther before Ahasuerus]]'', [[Artemisia Gentileschi]], c. 1630]]\nAhasuerus is given as the name of the father of [[Darius the Mede]] in the [[Book of Daniel]].<ref>{{bibleref|Daniel|9:1}}</ref>  Josephus names [[Astyages]] as the father of Darius the Mede, and the description of the latter as uncle and father-in-law of [[Cyrus the Great|Cyrus]] by mediaeval Jewish commentators matches that of Cyaxares II, who is said to be the son of Astyages by [[Xenophon]]. Thus this Ahasuerus is commonly identified with Astyages. He is alternatively identified, together with the Ahasuerus of the Book of Tobit, as Cyaxares I, said to be the father of Astyages. Views differ on how to reconcile the sources in this case. One view is that the description of Ahasuerus as the \"father\" of Darius the Mede should be understood in the broader sense of \"forebear\" or \"ancestor.\" Another view notes that on the [[Behistun Inscription]], \"Cyaxares\" is a family name, and thus considers the description as literal, viewing Astyages as an intermediate ruler wrongly placed in the family line in the Greek sources.\n\nMost scholars view Darius the Mede as a literary fiction.{{sfn|Hill|2009|p=114}}\n\n===Book of Tobit===\nIn some versions of the [[deuterocanon]]ical Book of Tobit, Ahasuerus is given as the name of an associate of [[Nebuchadrezzar II|Nebuchadnezzar]], who together with him, destroyed [[Nineveh]] just before Tobit's death.<ref>Book of Tobit, 14:15.</ref>  A traditional [[Catholic]] view is that he is identical to the Ahasuerus of Daniel 9:1<ref>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02005c.htm Maas, Anthony (1907).

Other Septuagint texts have the name ''Achiachar''.
