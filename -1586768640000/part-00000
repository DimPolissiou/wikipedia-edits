The first expression of this concept was a mock-up unveiled in 1966 in the experimental shop of the Ministry of Aircraft's factory number 329, where Mil was head designer. The mock-up designated V-24 was based on another project, the [[Mil Mi-22|V-22 utility helicopter]], which never flew. The V-24 had a central infantry compartment that could hold eight troops sitting back to back, and a set of small wings positioned to the top rear of the passenger cabin, capable of holding up to six missiles or rockets and a twin-barreled [[Gryazev-Shipunov GSh-23L|GSh-23L cannon]] fixed to the landing skid.\n\n[[File:Mil Mi-24A Hind.jpg|thumb|left|Mil Mi-24A]]\nMil proposed the design to the heads of the Soviet armed forces. While he had the support of a number of strategists, he was opposed by several more senior members of the armed forces, who believed that conventional weapons were a better use of resources. Despite the opposition, Mil managed to persuade the defence minister's first deputy, Marshal [[Andrei Grechko|Andrey A. Grechko]], to convene an expert panel to look into the matter. While the panel's opinions were mixed, supporters of the project eventually held sway and a request for design proposals for a battlefield support helicopter was issued. The development and use of [[gunship]]s and [[attack helicopter]]s by the [[US Army]] during the [[Vietnam War]] convinced the Soviets of the advantages of armed helicopter ground support, and fostered support for the development of the Mi-24.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=ADA067345&Location=U2&doc=GetTRDoc.pdf|title=Student research report: The Soviet attack helicopter|year=1977|publisher=[[DTIC]]|first=Kevin V.|last=Culhane|accessdate=1 July 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629180153/http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=ADA067345&Location=U2&doc=GetTRDoc.pdf|archive-date=29 June 2011| url-status= live |df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nMil engineers prepared two basic designs: a 7-ton single-engine design and a 10.5-ton twin-engine design, both based on the 1,700&nbsp;hp Izotov TV3-177A [[turboshaft]]. Later, three complete mock-ups were produced, along with five cockpit mock-ups to allow the pilot and weapon station operator positions to be fine-tuned.\n\nThe Kamov design bureau suggested an army version of their [[Kamov Ka-25|Ka-25]] ASW helicopter as a low-cost option. This was considered but later dropped in favor of the new Mil twin-engine design. A number of changes were made at the insistence of the military, including the replacement of the 23&nbsp;mm cannon with a rapid-fire heavy machine gun mounted in a chin turret, and the use of the [[9K114 Shturm]] (AT-6 Spiral) anti-tank missile.\n\nA directive was issued on 6 May 1968 to proceed with the development of the twin-engine design. Work proceeded under Mil until his death in 1970. Detailed design work began in August 1968 under the codename Yellow 24. A full-scale mock-up of the design was reviewed and approved in February 1969. Flight tests with a prototype began on 15 September 1969 with a tethered hover, and four days later the first free flight was conducted. A second prototype was built, followed by a test batch of ten helicopters.\n\n[[File:Russian Air Force Mil Mi-24P Dvurekov-4.jpg|thumb|Russian Air Force Mil Mi-24P]]\nAcceptance testing for the design began in June 1970, continuing for 18 months. Changes made in the design addressed structural strength, fatigue problems and vibration levels. Also, a 12-degree [[Dihedral (aircraft)#Anhedral|anhedral]] was introduced to the wings to address the aircraft's tendency to [[Dutch roll]] at speeds in excess of 200&nbsp;km/h (124&nbsp;mph), and the [[3M11 Falanga|Falanga]] missile pylons were moved from the fuselage to the wingtips. The tail rotor was moved from the right to the left side of the tail, and the rotation direction reversed. The tail rotor now rotated up on the side towards the front of the aircraft, into the downwash of the rotor, which increased the efficiency of the tail rotor. A number of other design changes were made until the production version Mi-24A (''izdeliye 245'') entered production in 1970, obtaining its [[initial operating capability]] in 1971 and was officially accepted into the state arsenal in 1972.<ref name=\"mil24yefim\">{{cite book |title=Mil Mi-24, Attack Helicopter|author=Yefim Gordon & Dmitry Komissarov|publisher=Airlife|year=2001}}</ref>\n\nIn 1972, following completion of the Mi-24, development began on a unique attack helicopter with transport capability. The new design had a reduced transport capability (three troops instead of eight) and was called the [[Mi-28]], and that of the [[Ka-50]] attack helicopter, which is smaller and more maneuverable and does not have the large cabin for carrying troops. In October 2007, the [[Russian Air Force]] announced it would replace its Mi-24 fleet with [[Mil Mi-28|Mi-28Ns]] and [[Kamov Ka-50|Ka-52s]] by 2015.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.strategypage.com/htmw/htairfo/articles/20071031.aspx |title=Mi-28 Replacing Mi-24 |website=Strategy Page |date=1 October 2007 |access-date=19 November 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071203023804/http://www.strategypage.com/htmw/htairfo/articles/20071031.aspx |archive-date=3 December 2007 |url-status= live |df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kommersant.com/p-11581/Combat_helicopter/ |title=Russia's Air Force to Replace Combat Helicopters by 2015 |date=24 October 2007 |website=[[Kommersant]] |url-status= dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071026052952/http://www.kommersant.com/p-11581/Combat_helicopter/ |archivedate=26 October 2007}}</ref>\n\n==Design==\n\n===Overview===\n[[File:Mil Mi-35M (51 yellow).jpg|thumb|[[Russian Air Force]] Mi-35\u041c]]\n\nThe core of the aircraft was derived from the [[Mil Mi-8]] (NATO reporting name \"Hip\") with two top-mounted [[turboshaft]] engines driving a mid-mounted 17.3 m five-blade main [[Helicopter rotor|rotor]] and a three-blade tail rotor. The engine configuration gave the aircraft its distinctive double air intake. Original versions have an angular greenhouse-style cockpit; Model D and later have a characteristic tandem [[Cockpit (aviation)|cockpit]] with a \"double bubble\" [[bubble canopy|canopy]]. Other airframe components came from the [[Mil Mi-14|Mi-14]] \"Haze\". Two mid-mounted stub wings provide weapon [[hardpoint]]s, each offering three stations, in addition to providing [[Lift (force)|lift]]. The loadout mix is mission dependent; Mi-24s can be tasked with close air support, anti-tank operations, or aerial combat.\n\nThe Mi-24 fuselage is armored and can resist impacts from [[.50 BMG|12.7&nbsp;mm]] (0.50&nbsp;in) rounds from all angles. The [[titanium]] rotor blades are resistant to 12.7&nbsp;mm rounds. The cockpit is protected by ballistic-resistant windscreens and a titanium-armored tub.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/74384437/Red-Star-Fighters-and-Ground-Attack# |title=Red Star Fighters & Ground Attack |publisher=Windrow & Greene |year=1994 |author=Halberstadt, Hans |pages=85, 88 |accessdate=2 December 2011 |url-status= dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019120931/http://www.scribd.com/doc/74384437/Red-Star-Fighters-and-Ground-Attack |archivedate=19 October 2013}}</ref> The cockpit and crew compartment are [[Pressurization|overpressurized]] to protect the crew in [[NBC weapon|NBC condition]]s.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.military-forces.net/helicopters/mil-mi-24/|title=Mil Mi-24 Helicopter \u2013 Military Forces|work=Military Forces|access-date=2017-07-04|language=en-US|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170902093900/https://www.military-forces.net/helicopters/mil-mi-24/|archive-date=2 September 2017| url-status= live |df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Flight characteristics===\n[[File:Helicopter Cockpit Mil Mi-24D Hind.jpg|thumb|left|Mi-24D cockpit]]\n\nConsiderable attention was given to making the Mi-24 fast. The airframe was streamlined, and fitted with retractable [[tricycle undercarriage]] landing gear to reduce drag. At high speed, the wings provide considerable lift (up to a quarter of total lift). The main rotor was tilted 2.5\u00b0 to the right from the fuselage to compensate for [[Translation (geometry)|translating]] tendency at a hover. The landing gear was also tilted to the left so that the rotor would still be level when the aircraft was on the ground, making the rest of the airframe tilt to the left.

At the Ysterplaat Airshow 2006.]]\n\nAs a combination of armoured gunship and troop transport, the Mi-24 has no direct [[NATO]] counterpart. While the [[Bell UH-1 Iroquois|UH-1]] (\"Huey\") helicopters were used in the [[Vietnam War]] either to ferry troops, or as gunships, they were not able to do both at the same time. Converting a UH-1 into a gunship meant stripping the entire passenger area to accommodate extra fuel and ammunition, and removing its troop transport capability. The Mi-24 was designed to do both, and this was greatly exploited by airborne units of the Soviet Army during the 1980\u201389 [[Soviet\u2013Afghan War]]. The closest Western equivalent was the [[Sikorsky S-67 Blackhawk]], which used many of the same design principles and was also built as a high-speed, high-agility attack helicopter with limited troop transport capability using many components from the existing [[Sikorsky S-61]]. The S-67, however, was never adopted for service.<ref name=\"Airtoair\" /> Other Western equivalents are the Romanian Army's [[IAR 330]], which is a licence-built armed version of the [[A\u00e9rospatiale SA 330 Puma]], and the MH-60 Direct Action Penetrator, a special purpose armed variant of the [[Sikorsky UH-60 Black Hawk]]. The Hind has been called the world's only \"assault helicopter\" due to its combination of firepower and troop-carrying capability.{{citation needed |date=January 2014}}\n\n==Operational history==\n\n===Ogaden War (1977\u20131978)===\nThe first combat use of the Mi-24 was with the Ethiopian forces during the [[Ogaden War]] against [[Somalia]]. The helicopters formed part of a massive airlift of military equipment from the Soviet Union, after the Soviets switched sides towards the end of 1977. The helicopters were instrumental in the combined air and ground assault that allowed the Ethiopians to retake the [[Ogaden]] by the beginning of 1978.<ref>{{cite web|last=Cooper|first=Tom |url=http://www.acig.org/artman/publish/article_188.shtml |title=Ogaden War, 1977\u20131978|publisher=Air Combat Information Group|accessdate=18 March 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070107093450/http://www.acig.org/artman/publish/article_188.shtml|archivedate=7 January 2007}}</ref>\n\n===Chadian\u2013Libyan conflict (1978\u20131987)===\n{{See also|Toyota War|Operation Mount Hope III}}\n\nThe Libyan air force used Mi-24A and Mi-25 units during their numerous interventions in [[Chadian-Libyan conflict|Chad's civil war]].<ref name=\"Gordon & Komissarov\" /> The Mi-24s were first used in October 1980 in the battle of [[N'Djamena]], where they helped the [[People's Armed Forces]] seize the capital.\n\nIn March 1987, the [[Armed Forces of the North]], which were backed by the US and France, captured a Libyan air force base at [[Ouadi-Doum]] in Northern Chad. Among the aircraft captured during this raid were three Mi-25s. These were supplied to France, which in turn sent one to the United Kingdom and one to the USA.<ref name=\"mil24yefim\"/>\n\n===Soviet war in Afghanistan (1979\u20131989)===\nThe aircraft was operated extensively during the [[Soviet\u2013Afghan War]], mainly for bombing [[Mujahideen]] fighters. When the U.S. supplied heat-seeking [[FIM-92 Stinger|Stinger]] missiles to the Mujahideen, the Soviet [[Mil Mi-8|Mi-8]] and Mi-24 helicopters proved to be favorite targets of the rebels.\n\nIt is difficult to find the total number of Mi-24s used in Afghanistan.<ref>Grau, Lester W.

The rebels called the Mi-24 \"''Shaitan-Arba''\" (Satan's Chariot)\".<ref name=\"greg2\"/> In one case, an Mi-24 pilot who was out of ammunition managed to rescue a company of infantry by maneuvering aggressively towards Mujahideen guerrillas and scaring them off. The Mi-24 was popular with ground troops, since it could stay on the battlefield and provide fire as needed, while \"fast mover\" [[Strike aircraft|strike jets]] could only stay for a short time before heading back to base to refuel.\n\nThe Mi-24's favoured munition was the {{convert|80|mm|adj=on}} [[S-8 rocket|S-8]] [[rocket]], the {{convert|57|mm|adj=on|abbr=on}} [[S-5 rocket|S-5]] having proven too light to be effective. The {{convert|23|mm|adj=on|abbr=on}} [[gun pod]] was also popular. Extra rounds of rocket ammunition were often carried internally so that the crew could land and self-reload in the field. The Mi-24 could carry ten {{convert|100|kg|adj=on}} [[iron bomb]]s for attacks on camps or strongpoints, while harder targets could be dealt with a load of four {{convert|250|kg|adj=on}} or two {{convert|500|kg|adj=on}} iron bombs.<ref name=vert>Yakubovich, Nikolay. ''Boevye vertolety Rossii. Ot \"Omegi\" do \"Alligatora\"'' (Russia's combat helicopters. From Omega to Alligator). Moscow, Yuza & Eksmo, 2010, {{ISBN|978-5-699-41797-1}}, pp.164\u2013173.</ref> Some Mi-24 crews became experts at dropping bombs precisely on targets. [[Fuel Air Explosive|Fuel-air explosive]] bombs were also used in a few instances, though crews initially underestimated the sheer blast force of such weapons and were caught by the shock waves.\n\nCombat experience quickly demonstrated the disadvantages of having an Mi-24 carrying troops. Gunship crews found the soldiers a concern and a distraction while being shot at, and preferred to fly lightly loaded anyway, especially given their operations from high ground altitudes in Afghanistan. Mi-24 troop compartment armour was often removed to reduce weight. Troops would be carried in Mi-8 helicopters while the Mi-24s provided fire support.\n\nIt proved useful to carry a technician in the Mi-24's crew compartment to handle a light machine gun in a window port. This gave the Mi-24 some ability to \"watch its back\" while leaving a target area. In some cases, a light machine gun was fitted on both sides to allow the technician to move from one side to the other without having to take the machine gun with him.\n\nThis weapon configuration still left the gunship blind to the direct rear, and Mil experimented with fitting a machine gun in the back of the fuselage, accessible to the gunner through a narrow crawl-way. The experiment was highly unsuccessful, as the space was cramped, full of engine exhaust fumes, and otherwise unbearable. During a demonstration, an overweight Soviet Air Force general got stuck in the crawl-way.<ref name=\"mil24yefim\"/> Operational Mi-24s were retrofitted with rear-view mirrors to help the pilot spot threats and take evasive action.\n\nBesides protecting helicopter troop assaults and supporting ground actions, the Mi-24 also protected convoys, using rockets with [[flechette]] warheads to drive off ambushes; performed strikes on predesignated targets; and engaged in \"hunter-killer\" sweeps. Hunter-killer Mi-24s operated at a minimum in pairs, but were more often in groups of four or eight, to provide mutual fire support. The Mujahideen learned to move mostly at night to avoid the gunships, and in response the Soviets trained their Mi-24 crews in night-fighting, dropping parachute flares to illuminate potential targets for attack. The Mujahideen quickly caught on and scattered as quickly as possible when Soviet target designation flares were lit nearby.\n\n====Attrition in Afghanistan====\nThe war in Afghanistan brought with it losses by attrition.<ref name=\"greg2\"/> The environment itself, dusty and often hot, was rough on the machines; dusty conditions led to the development of the PZU air intake filters. The rebels' primary air-defense weapons early in the war were heavy machine guns and anti-aircraft cannons, though anything smaller than a 23 millimetre shell generally did not do much damage to an Mi-24. The cockpit glass panels were resistant to 12.7&nbsp;mm (.50 in caliber) rounds.\n\nThe rebels also quickly began to use Soviet-made and US shoulder-launched, man-portable air defense [[MANPADS]] missiles such as the [[SA-7|Strela]] and [[FIM-43 Redeye|Redeye]] which had either been captured from the Soviets or their Afghan allies or were supplied from Western sources. Many of them came from stocks that the Israelis had captured during their wars with Soviet backed states in the Middle East. Owing to a combination of the limited capabilities of these early types of missiles, poor training and poor material condition of the missiles, they were not particularly effective. Instead, the [[RPG-7]], originally developed as an antitank weapon, was the first effective countermeasure to the Hind. The RPG-7, not designed for air defense, had several inherent shortcomings in this role. Since the RPG-7 is unguided, pilots could successfully evade if they became aware of the projectile. Additionally, when fired at the angles needed to hit aerial targets, the backblast could easily wound the shooter, and the inevitable cloud of smoke and dust made it easy for gunners to spot the shooter's position.\n\nFrom 1986,<ref name=vert/> the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] began supplying the Afghan rebels with newer [[FIM-92 Stinger|Stinger]] shoulder-launched, heat-seeking SAMs.<ref>{{cite web |last=Silverstein |first=Ken |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/org/news/2001/011002-attack03.htm |title=Stingers, Stingers, Who's Got the Stingers? |publisher=GlobalSecurity.org |date=2 October 2001 |accessdate=8 October 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080727024330/http://www.globalsecurity.org/org/news/2001/011002-attack03.htm |archive-date=27 July 2008 |url-status= live |df=dmy-all}}</ref> These were a marked improvement over earlier weapons, and while their actual military impact was not irrelevant, their real value was their demoralization and deterrent value against air power, and their propaganda worth to groups opposed to the Soviet occupation. The Stinger missiles locked on to infra-red emissions from the aircraft, particularly engine exhaust, and was resistant to interference from decoy flares. Countermeasure flares and missile warning systems were later installed in all Soviet [[Mil Mi-2]], Mi-8, and Mi-24 helicopters, giving pilots a chance to evade missiles fired at them. Heat dissipation devices were also fitted to exhausts to decrease the Mi-24's heat signature. Tactical and doctrinal changes were introduced to make it harder for the enemy to deploy these weapons effectively. These reduced the Stinger threat, but did not eliminate it.\n\nInitially, the attack doctrine of the Mi-24 was to approach its target from high altitude and dive downwards. After the introduction of the Stinger, doctrine changed to \"[[Nap-of-the-earth|nap of the earth]]\" flying, where they approached very low to the ground and engaged more laterally, popping up to only about {{convert|200|ft|m|abbr=on}} in order to aim rockets or cannons.<ref>[https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/checkpoint/wp/2015/10/08/in-syria-hints-of-soviet-helicopter-tactics-from-afghanistan/ In Syria, hints of Soviet helicopter tactics from Afghanistan] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151029184542/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/checkpoint/wp/2015/10/08/in-syria-hints-of-soviet-helicopter-tactics-from-afghanistan/ |date=29 October 2015}} \u2013 Washingtonpost.com, 8 October 2015</ref>\n\nMi-24s were also used to shield jet transports flying in and out of [[Kabul]] from Stingers. The gunships carried flares to blind the heat-seeking missiles. The crews called themselves \"Mandatory [[Alexander Matrosov|Matrosovs]]\", after a Soviet hero of World War II who threw himself across a German machine gun to let his comrades break through.\n\nAccording to Russian sources, 74 helicopters were lost, including 27 shot down by Stinger and two by Redeye.<ref name=vert/> In many cases, however, the helicopters, thanks to their armor and the durability of construction, withstood significant damage and were able to return to base.\n\n====Mi-24 crews and end of Soviet involvement====\nMi-24 crews carried [[AK-74]] assault rifles and other hand-held weapons to give them a better chance of survival if forced down.<ref name=\"greg2\"/> Early in the war, Marat Tischenko, head of the Mil design bureau visited Afghanistan to see what the troops thought of his helicopters, and gunship crews put on several displays for him. They even demonstrated maneuvers, such as [[barrel roll]]s, which design engineers considered impossible. An astounded Tischenko commented, \"I thought I knew what my helicopters could do, now I'm not so sure!\"<ref name=\"greg2\"/>\n\nThe last Soviet Mi-24 shot down was during the night of 2 February 1989, with both crewmen killed.

The first expression of this concept was a mock-up unveiled in 1966 in the experimental shop of the Ministry of Aircraft's factory number 329, where Mil was head designer. The mock-up designated V-24 was based on another project, the [[Mil Mi-22|V-22 utility helicopter]], which never flew. The V-24 had a central infantry compartment that could hold eight troops sitting back to back, and a set of small wings positioned to the top rear of the passenger cabin, capable of holding up to six missiles or rockets and a twin-barreled [[Gryazev-Shipunov GSh-23L|GSh-23L cannon]] fixed to the landing skid.\n\n[[File:Mil Mi-24A Hind.jpg|thumb|left|Mil Mi-24A]]\nMil proposed the design to the heads of the Soviet armed forces. While he had the support of a number of strategists, he was opposed by several more senior members of the armed forces, who believed that conventional weapons were a better use of resources. Despite the opposition, Mil managed to persuade the defence minister's first deputy, Marshal [[Andrei Grechko|Andrey A. Grechko]], to convene an expert panel to look into the matter. While the panel's opinions were mixed, supporters of the project eventually held sway and a request for design proposals for a battlefield support helicopter was issued. The development and use of [[gunship]]s and [[attack helicopter]]s by the [[US Army]] during the [[Vietnam War]] convinced the Soviets of the advantages of armed helicopter ground support, and fostered support for the development of the Mi-24.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=ADA067345&Location=U2&doc=GetTRDoc.pdf|title=Student research report: The Soviet attack helicopter|year=1977|publisher=[[DTIC]]|first=Kevin V.|last=Culhane|accessdate=1 July 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629180153/http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=ADA067345&Location=U2&doc=GetTRDoc.pdf|archive-date=29 June 2011| url-status= live |df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nMil engineers prepared two basic designs: a 7-ton single-engine design and a 10.5-ton twin-engine design, both based on the 1,700&nbsp;hp Izotov TV3-177A [[turboshaft]]. Later, three complete mock-ups were produced, along with five cockpit mock-ups to allow the pilot and weapon station operator positions to be fine-tuned.\n\nThe Kamov design bureau suggested an army version of their [[Kamov Ka-25|Ka-25]] ASW helicopter as a low-cost option. This was considered but later dropped in favor of the new Mil twin-engine design. A number of changes were made at the insistence of the military, including the replacement of the 23&nbsp;mm cannon with a rapid-fire heavy machine gun mounted in a chin turret, and the use of the [[9K114 Shturm]] (AT-6 Spiral) anti-tank missile.\n\nA directive was issued on 6 May 1968 to proceed with the development of the twin-engine design. Work proceeded under Mil until his death in 1970. Detailed design work began in August 1968 under the codename Yellow 24. A full-scale mock-up of the design was reviewed and approved in February 1969. Flight tests with a prototype began on 15 September 1969 with a tethered hover, and four days later the first free flight was conducted. A second prototype was built, followed by a test batch of ten helicopters.\n\n[[File:Russian Air Force Mil Mi-24P Dvurekov-4.jpg|thumb|Russian Air Force Mil Mi-24P]]\nAcceptance testing for the design began in June 1970, continuing for 18 months. Changes made in the design addressed structural strength, fatigue problems and vibration levels. Also, a 12-degree [[Dihedral (aircraft)#Anhedral|anhedral]] was introduced to the wings to address the aircraft's tendency to [[Dutch roll]] at speeds in excess of 200&nbsp;km/h (124&nbsp;mph), and the [[3M11 Falanga|Falanga]] missile pylons were moved from the fuselage to the wingtips. The tail rotor was moved from the right to the left side of the tail, and the rotation direction reversed. The tail rotor now rotated up on the side towards the front of the aircraft, into the downwash of the rotor, which increased the efficiency of the tail rotor. A number of other design changes were made until the production version Mi-24A (''izdeliye 245'') entered production in 1970, obtaining its [[initial operating capability]] in 1971 and was officially accepted into the state arsenal in 1972.<ref name=\"mil24yefim\">{{cite book |title=Mil Mi-24, Attack Helicopter|author=Yefim Gordon & Dmitry Komissarov|publisher=Airlife|year=2001}}</ref>\n\nIn 1972, following completion of the Mi-24, development began on a unique attack helicopter with transport capability. The new design had a reduced transport capability (three troops instead of eight) and was called the [[Mi-28]], and that of the [[Ka-50]] attack helicopter, which is smaller and more maneuverable and does not have the large cabin for carrying troops. In October 2007, the [[Russian Air Force]] announced it would replace its Mi-24 fleet with [[Mil Mi-28|Mi-28Ns]] and [[Kamov Ka-50|Ka-52s]] by 2015.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.strategypage.com/htmw/htairfo/articles/20071031.aspx |title=Mi-28 Replacing Mi-24 |website=Strategy Page |date=1 October 2007 |access-date=19 November 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071203023804/http://www.strategypage.com/htmw/htairfo/articles/20071031.aspx |archive-date=3 December 2007 |url-status= live |df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kommersant.com/p-11581/Combat_helicopter/ |title=Russia's Air Force to Replace Combat Helicopters by 2015 |date=24 October 2007 |website=[[Kommersant]] |url-status= dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071026052952/http://www.kommersant.com/p-11581/Combat_helicopter/ |archivedate=26 October 2007}}</ref>\n\n==Design==\n\n===Overview===\n[[File:Mil Mi-35M (51 yellow).jpg|thumb|[[Russian Air Force]] Mi-35\u041c]]\n\nThe core of the aircraft was derived from the [[Mil Mi-8]] (NATO reporting name \"Hip\") with two top-mounted [[turboshaft]] engines driving a mid-mounted 17.3 m five-blade main [[Helicopter rotor|rotor]] and a three-blade tail rotor. The engine configuration gave the aircraft its distinctive double air intake. Original versions have an angular greenhouse-style cockpit; Model D and later have a characteristic tandem [[Cockpit (aviation)|cockpit]] with a \"double bubble\" [[bubble canopy|canopy]]. Other airframe components came from the [[Mil Mi-14|Mi-14]] \"Haze\". Two mid-mounted stub wings provide weapon [[hardpoint]]s, each offering three stations, in addition to providing [[Lift (force)|lift]]. The loadout mix is mission dependent; Mi-24s can be tasked with close air support, anti-tank operations, or aerial combat.\n\nThe Mi-24 fuselage is armored and can resist impacts from [[.50 BMG|12.7&nbsp;mm]] (0.50&nbsp;in) rounds from all angles. The [[titanium]] rotor blades are resistant to 12.7&nbsp;mm rounds. The cockpit is protected by ballistic-resistant windscreens and a titanium-armored tub.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/74384437/Red-Star-Fighters-and-Ground-Attack# |title=Red Star Fighters & Ground Attack |publisher=Windrow & Greene |year=1994 |author=Halberstadt, Hans |pages=85, 88 |accessdate=2 December 2011 |url-status= dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019120931/http://www.scribd.com/doc/74384437/Red-Star-Fighters-and-Ground-Attack |archivedate=19 October 2013}}</ref> The cockpit and crew compartment are [[Pressurization|overpressurized]] to protect the crew in [[NBC weapon|NBC condition]]s.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.military-forces.net/helicopters/mil-mi-24/|title=Mil Mi-24 Helicopter \u2013 Military Forces|work=Military Forces|access-date=2017-07-04|language=en-US|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170902093900/https://www.military-forces.net/helicopters/mil-mi-24/|archive-date=2 September 2017| url-status= live |df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Flight characteristics===\n[[File:Helicopter Cockpit Mil Mi-24D Hind.jpg|thumb|left|Mi-24D cockpit]]\n\nConsiderable attention was given to making the Mi-24 fast. The airframe was streamlined, and fitted with retractable [[tricycle undercarriage]] landing gear to reduce drag. At high speed, the wings provide considerable lift (up to a quarter of total lift). The main rotor was tilted 2.5\u00b0 to the right from the fuselage to compensate for [[Translation (geometry)|translating]] tendency at a hover. The landing gear was also tilted to the left so that the rotor would still be level when the aircraft was on the ground, making the rest of the airframe tilt to the left. The tail was also asymmetrical to give a side force at speed, thus unloading the tail rotor.<ref name=\"Gordon & Komissarov\">{{cite book |title=Mil Mi-24 Hind, Attack Helicopter|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9781840372380|url-access=registration|first1=Yefim|last1=Gordon|first2=Dmitry|last2=Komissarov|publisher=Airlife|year=2001}}</ref>\n\nA modified Mi-24B, named A-10, was used in several speed and time-to-climb world record attempts.

While the [[Bell UH-1 Iroquois|UH-1]] (\"Huey\") helicopters were used in the [[Vietnam War]] either to ferry troops, or as gunships, they were not able to do both at the same time. Converting a UH-1 into a gunship meant stripping the entire passenger area to accommodate extra fuel and ammunition, and removing its troop transport capability. The Mi-24 was designed to do both, and this was greatly exploited by airborne units of the Soviet Army during the 1980\u201389 [[Soviet\u2013Afghan War]]. The closest Western equivalent was the [[Sikorsky S-67 Blackhawk]], which used many of the same design principles and was also built as a high-speed, high-agility attack helicopter with limited troop transport capability using many components from the existing [[Sikorsky S-61]]. The S-67, however, was never adopted for service.<ref name=\"Airtoair\" /> Other Western equivalents are the Romanian Army's [[IAR 330]], which is a licence-built armed version of the [[A\u00e9rospatiale SA 330 Puma]], and the MH-60 Direct Action Penetrator, a special purpose armed variant of the [[Sikorsky UH-60 Black Hawk]]. The Hind has been called the world's only \"assault helicopter\" due to its combination of firepower and troop-carrying capability.{{citation needed |date=January 2014}}\n\n==Operational history==\n\n===Ogaden War (1977\u20131978)===\nThe first combat use of the Mi-24 was with the Ethiopian forces during the [[Ogaden War]] against [[Somalia]]. The helicopters formed part of a massive airlift of military equipment from the Soviet Union, after the Soviets switched sides towards the end of 1977. The helicopters were instrumental in the combined air and ground assault that allowed the Ethiopians to retake the [[Ogaden]] by the beginning of 1978.<ref>{{cite web|last=Cooper|first=Tom |url=http://www.acig.org/artman/publish/article_188.shtml |title=Ogaden War, 1977\u20131978|publisher=Air Combat Information Group|accessdate=18 March 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070107093450/http://www.acig.org/artman/publish/article_188.shtml|archivedate=7 January 2007}}</ref>\n\n===Chadian\u2013Libyan conflict (1978\u20131987)===\n{{See also|Toyota War|Operation Mount Hope III}}\n\nThe Libyan air force used Mi-24A and Mi-25 units during their numerous interventions in [[Chadian-Libyan conflict|Chad's civil war]].<ref name=\"Gordon & Komissarov\" /> The Mi-24s were first used in October 1980 in the battle of [[N'Djamena]], where they helped the [[People's Armed Forces]] seize the capital.\n\nIn March 1987, the [[Armed Forces of the North]], which were backed by the US and France, captured a Libyan air force base at [[Ouadi-Doum]] in Northern Chad.

The rebels called the Mi-24 \"''Shaitan-Arba''\" (Satan's Chariot)\".<ref name=\"greg2\"/> In one case, an Mi-24 pilot who was out of ammunition managed to rescue a company of infantry by maneuvering aggressively towards Mujahideen guerrillas and scaring them off. The Mi-24 was popular with ground troops, since it could stay on the battlefield and provide fire as needed, while \"fast mover\" [[Strike aircraft|strike jets]] could only stay for a short time before heading back to base to refuel.\n\nThe Mi-24's favoured munition was the {{convert|80|mm|adj=on}} [[S-8 rocket|S-8]] [[rocket]], the {{convert|57|mm|adj=on|abbr=on}} [[S-5 rocket|S-5]] having proven too light to be effective. The {{convert|23|mm|adj=on|abbr=on}} [[gun pod]] was also popular. Extra rounds of rocket ammunition were often carried internally so that the crew could land and self-reload in the field. The Mi-24 could carry ten {{convert|100|kg|adj=on}} [[iron bomb]]s for attacks on camps or strongpoints, while harder targets could be dealt with a load of four {{convert|250|kg|adj=on}} or two {{convert|500|kg|adj=on}} iron bombs.<ref name=vert>Yakubovich, Nikolay. ''Boevye vertolety Rossii. Ot \"Omegi\" do \"Alligatora\"'' (Russia's combat helicopters. From Omega to Alligator). Moscow, Yuza & Eksmo, 2010, {{ISBN|978-5-699-41797-1}}, pp.164\u2013173.</ref> Some Mi-24 crews became experts at dropping bombs precisely on targets. [[Fuel Air Explosive|Fuel-air explosive]] bombs were also used in a few instances, though crews initially underestimated the sheer blast force of such weapons and were caught by the shock waves.\n\nCombat experience quickly demonstrated the disadvantages of having an Mi-24 carrying troops. Gunship crews found the soldiers a concern and a distraction while being shot at, and preferred to fly lightly loaded anyway, especially given their operations from high ground altitudes in Afghanistan. Mi-24 troop compartment armour was often removed to reduce weight. Troops would be carried in Mi-8 helicopters while the Mi-24s provided fire support.\n\nIt proved useful to carry a technician in the Mi-24's crew compartment to handle a light machine gun in a window port. This gave the Mi-24 some ability to \"watch its back\" while leaving a target area. In some cases, a light machine gun was fitted on both sides to allow the technician to move from one side to the other without having to take the machine gun with him.\n\nThis weapon configuration still left the gunship blind to the direct rear, and Mil experimented with fitting a machine gun in the back of the fuselage, accessible to the gunner through a narrow crawl-way. The experiment was highly unsuccessful, as the space was cramped, full of engine exhaust fumes, and otherwise unbearable. During a demonstration, an overweight Soviet Air Force general got stuck in the crawl-way.<ref name=\"mil24yefim\"/> Operational Mi-24s were retrofitted with rear-view mirrors to help the pilot spot threats and take evasive action.\n\nBesides protecting helicopter troop assaults and supporting ground actions, the Mi-24 also protected convoys, using rockets with [[flechette]] warheads to drive off ambushes; performed strikes on predesignated targets; and engaged in \"hunter-killer\" sweeps. Hunter-killer Mi-24s operated at a minimum in pairs, but were more often in groups of four or eight, to provide mutual fire support. The Mujahideen learned to move mostly at night to avoid the gunships, and in response the Soviets trained their Mi-24 crews in night-fighting, dropping parachute flares to illuminate potential targets for attack. The Mujahideen quickly caught on and scattered as quickly as possible when Soviet target designation flares were lit nearby.\n\n====Attrition in Afghanistan====\nThe war in Afghanistan brought with it losses by attrition.<ref name=\"greg2\"/> The environment itself, dusty and often hot, was rough on the machines; dusty conditions led to the development of the PZU air intake filters. The rebels' primary air-defence weapons early in the war were heavy machine guns and anti-aircraft cannons, though anything smaller than a 23 millimetre shell generally did not do much damage to an Mi-24. The cockpit glass panels were resistant to 12.7&nbsp;mm (.50 in caliber) rounds.\n\nThe rebels also quickly began to use Soviet-made and American shoulder-launched, man-portable air defense [[MANPADS]] missiles such as the [[SA-7|Strela]] and [[FIM-43 Redeye|Redeye]] which had either been captured from the Soviets or their Afghan allies or were supplied from Western sources. Many of them came from stocks that the Israelis had captured during their wars with Soviet backed states in the Middle East. Owing to a combination of the limited capabilities of these early types of missiles, poor training and poor material condition of the missiles, they were not particularly effective. Instead, the [[RPG-7]], originally developed as an antitank weapon, was the first effective countermeasure to the Hind. The RPG-7, not designed for air defense, had several inherent shortcomings in this role. Since the RPG-7 is unguided, pilots could successfully evade if they became aware of the projectile. Additionally, when fired at the angles needed to hit aerial targets, the backblast could easily wound the shooter, and the inevitable cloud of smoke and dust made it easy for gunners to spot the shooter's position.\n\nFrom 1986,<ref name=vert/> the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] began supplying the Afghan rebels with newer [[FIM-92 Stinger|Stinger]] shoulder-launched, heat-seeking SAMs.<ref>{{cite web |last=Silverstein |first=Ken |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/org/news/2001/011002-attack03.htm |title=Stingers, Stingers, Who's Got the Stingers? |publisher=GlobalSecurity.org |date=2 October 2001 |accessdate=8 October 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080727024330/http://www.globalsecurity.org/org/news/2001/011002-attack03.htm |archive-date=27 July 2008 |url-status= live |df=dmy-all}}</ref> These were a marked improvement over earlier weapons, and while their actual military impact was not irrelevant, their real value was their demoralization and deterrent value against air power, and their propaganda worth to anti-Soviet groups. The Stinger missile locked on to infra-red emissions from the aircraft, particularly engine exhaust, and was resistant to interference from decoy flares. Countermeasure flares and missile warning systems were later installed in all Soviet [[Mil Mi-2]], Mi-8, and Mi-24 helicopters, giving pilots a chance to evade the missile. Heat dissipaters were also fitted to exhausts to decrease the Mi-24's heat signature. Tactical and doctrinal changes were introduced to make it harder for the enemy to deploy these weapons effectively. These reduced the Stinger threat, but did not eliminate it.\n\nInitially, the attack doctrine of the Mi-24 was to approach its target from high altitude and dive downwards.  After the introduction of the Stinger, doctrine changed to \"[[Nap-of-the-earth|nap of the earth]]\" flying, where they approached very low to the ground and engaged more laterally, popping up to only about {{convert|200|ft|m|abbr=on}} in order to aim rockets or cannons.<ref>[https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/checkpoint/wp/2015/10/08/in-syria-hints-of-soviet-helicopter-tactics-from-afghanistan/ In Syria, hints of Soviet helicopter tactics from Afghanistan] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151029184542/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/checkpoint/wp/2015/10/08/in-syria-hints-of-soviet-helicopter-tactics-from-afghanistan/ |date=29 October 2015}} \u2013 Washingtonpost.com, 8 October 2015</ref>\n\nMi-24s were also used to shield jet transports flying in and out of [[Kabul]] from Stingers. The gunships carried flares to blind the heat-seeking missiles. The crews called themselves \"Mandatory [[Alexander Matrosov|Matrosovs]]\", after a Soviet hero of the Second World War who threw himself across a German machine gun to let his comrades break through.\n\nAccording to Russian sources, 74 helicopters were lost, including 27 shot down by Stinger and two by Redeye.<ref name=vert/> In many cases, however, the helicopters, thanks to their armour and the durability of construction, withstood significant damage and were able to return to base.\n\n====Mi-24 crews and end of Soviet involvement====\nMi-24 crews carried [[AK-74]] assault rifles and other hand-held weapons to give them a better chance of survival if forced down.<ref name=\"greg2\"/> Early in the war, Marat Tischenko, head of the Mil design bureau visited Afghanistan to see what the troops thought of his helicopters, and gunship crews put on several displays for him. They even demonstrated maneuvers, such as [[barrel roll]]s, which design engineers considered impossible. An astounded Tischenko commented, \"I thought I knew what my helicopters could do, now I'm not so sure!\"<ref name=\"greg2\"/>\n\nThe last Soviet Mi-24 shot down was during the night of 2 February 1989, with both crewmen killed.

The first generation plant ''where power left the building'' was established at [[Bullendale]] in [[Otago, New Zealand|Otago]] in 1885, to provide power for a twenty [[Stamp mill|stamp battery]] at the Phoenix mine. The plant used water from the nearby Skippers Creek, a tributary of the [[Shotover River]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.historic.org.nz/TheRegister/RegisterSearch/RegisterResults.aspx?RID=5601|title= Phoenix Mine Hydro Electric Plant Site| publisher=[[New Zealand Historic Places Trust]]| accessdate= 6 April 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| title=Gold and electricity - Archaeological survey of Bullendale, Otago| publisher=Department of Conservation| author=P.G.

Rural areas were particular beneficiaries of subsidies for electrical grid systems, where supply was provided to create demand, with the intention of modernising the countryside. The results were notable \u2013 in the 1920s, electricity use increased at a rate of 22% per year. In fact, the 'load building' programmes were so successful that shortages started to occur from 1936 on, though a large number of new power stations built in the 1950s enabled supply to catch up again.<ref name=\"NZHA88\" />\n\nAfter the massive construction programmes had created a substantial supply of energy not dependent on international fossil fuel prices, New Zealand became less frugal with its energy use. While in 1978, its energy consumption (as expressed against economic output) hovered around the average of all [[OECD]] countries, during the 1980s New Zealand dropped far behind, increasing its energy use per economic unit by over 25%, while other nations slowly reduced their energy usage levels. Based on this economic comparison, in 1991 it was the second-least energy-efficient country out of 41 OECD countries.<ref name=\"NZHA98\">''New Zealand Historical Atlas'' \u2013 McKinnon, Malcolm (Editor); David Bateman, 1997, Plate 98</ref>\n\nAll of the government's energy assets originally came under the [[New Zealand Ministry of Works|Public Works Department]]. From 1946, the management of generation and transmission came under a new department, the State Hydro-Electric Department (SHD), renamed in 1958 as the New Zealand Electricity Department (NZED). In 1978, the Electricity Division of the Ministry of Energy assumed responsibility for electricity generation, transmission, policy advice and regulation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ea.govt.nz/about-us/functions/background-to-governance-and-regulation/ |title=Background to Governance and Regulation, Electricity Authority |accessdate=2011-09-26 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110811110313/http://www.ea.govt.nz/about-us/functions/background-to-governance-and-regulation/ |archivedate=11 August 2011 |df=dmy }}</ref> Distribution and retailing was the responsibility of local electric power boards (EPBs) or municipal electricity departments (MEDs).\n\nNew Zealand's electrical energy generation, previously state-owned as in most countries, was corporatised, deregulated and partly sold off over the last two decades of the twentieth century, following a model typical in the Western world. However, much of the generation and retail sectors, as well as the entire transmission sector, remains under government ownership as [[State-owned enterprises of New Zealand|state-owned enterprises]].\n\nThe [[Fourth Labour Government of New Zealand|Fourth Labour Government]] corporatised the Electricity Division as a [[State-owned enterprises of New Zealand|State Owned Enterprise]] in 1987, as the [[Electricity Corporation of New Zealand]] (ECNZ), which traded for a period as Electricorp. The [[Fourth National Government of New Zealand|Fourth National Government]] went further with the Energy Companies Act 1992, requiring EPBs and MEDs to become commercial companies in charge of distribution and retailing.\n\nIn 1994, ECNZ's transmission business was split off as [[Transpower New Zealand Limited|Transpower]]. In 1996, ECNZ was split again, with a new separate generation business, [[Contact Energy]], being formed. The Fourth National Government privatised [[Contact Energy]] in 1999. From 1 April 1999, the remainder of ECNZ was split again, with the major assets formed into three new state-owned enterprises (Mighty River Power (now [[Mercury Energy]]), [[Genesis Energy Limited|Genesis Energy]] and [[Meridian Energy]]) and with the minor assets being sold off. At the same time, local power companies were required to separate distribution and retailing, with the retail side of the business sold off, mainly to generation companies.\n\n==Organisation==\nNew Zealand's electricity sector is split into six distinct parts:\n* '''Generation''' \u2013 Generation companies generate electricity at power stations, selling the electricity generated via the wholesale market to retailers while physical electricity is injected into either transmission lines (grid-connected generation) or distribution lines (embedded generation). Numerous companies generate power, but 92 percent of the generation sector is dominated by five companies: [[Contact Energy]], [[Genesis Energy Limited|Genesis Energy]], [[Meridian Energy]], [[Mercury Energy]] and [[Trustpower]].\n* '''Transmission''' \u2013 [[Transpower New Zealand|Transpower]] operates the national transmission network, consisting of 11,000&nbsp;km of high voltage lines interconnecting generating power stations with grid exit points to supply distribution networks and large industrial consumers (direct consumers) in each of New Zealand's two main islands. A 611&nbsp;km [[high voltage direct current]] link ([[HVDC Inter-Island]]) connects the two islands' transmission networks together.\n* '''Distribution''' \u2013 Distribution companies operate 150,000&nbsp;km of medium and low-voltage lines interconnecting grid exit points with consumers and embedded generation. There are 29 distribution companies each serving a set geographic area.\n* '''Retail''' \u2013 Retail companies buy electricity from generators and on-sell it to consumers. Numerous companies retail electricity, including many generating companies, but 95 percent of the retail sector is dominated by five companies: [[Contact Energy]], [[Genesis Energy Limited|Genesis Energy]], [[Mercury Energy]], [[Meridian Energy]] and [[Trustpower]].\n* '''Consumption''' \u2013 Nearly two million consumers take electricity from the distribution networks or the transmission network and buy electricity from retailers for their use. Consumers range from typical households, which consume on average 8\u20139&nbsp;MWh per year, to the [[Tiwai Point]] Aluminium Smelter, which consumes 5,400,000&nbsp;MWh per year.\n* '''Regulation''' \u2013 New Zealand's [[Electricity Authority (New Zealand)|Electricity Authority]] is responsible for management of the electricity industry, while Transpower as System Operator manages the electricity system in real time to ensure generation matches demand. Policy and governance is managed by the New Zealand Government and several Crown entities, including the [[Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment]], the [[Commerce Commission]], and the [[Energy Efficiency and Conservation Authority]].\n\n===Regulation and policy===\n{{Main|Energy in New Zealand}}\n\nRenewable energy sources provide much of the nation's electricity production, with the New Zealand energy industry for example reporting a 75% share in 2013.<ref name=\"Energy2014\" /> The [[Fifth Labour Government of New Zealand]] had the goal of increasing this to 90% by 2025,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/rea/news/print/article/2007/09/new-zealand-commits-to-90-renewable-electricity-by-2025-50075 |title=New Zealand Commits to 90% Renewable Electricity by 2025| publisher=Renewable Energy World |date=26 September 2006 |accessdate=4 April 2011 }}</ref> the subsequent [[Fifth National Government of New Zealand|Fifth National Government]] put priority on security of supply.<ref>{{Cite web |url= http://national.org.nz/Article.aspx?ArticleId=28403|title= Policy on Energy |year=2008 |accessdate=8 January 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120419031731/http://www.national.org.nz/Article.aspx?ArticleId=28403 |archivedate=19 April 2012|publisher= National Party}}</ref>\n\nNew Zealand's Labour government introduced a number of measures in the 2000s as part of the vision of New Zealand becoming [[carbon neutral]] by 2020,<ref name=\"TICK\">{{cite news |url= http://www.nzherald.co.nz/topic/story.cfm?c_id=187&objectid=10478280 |title=Big tick for wind as power of the future |newspaper= The New Zealand Herald |first=Grant |last= Bradley |date= 26 November 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.publish.csiro.au/?act=view_file&file_id=EC136p7b.pdf |title=New Zealand to be carbon neutral by 2020 |work=Ecos 7 |date=April\u2013May 2007 |page= 136 |accessdate=26 November 2007}}</ref> and intended to collect levies for [[greenhouse effect]] emissions from 2010 onwards, to be added to power prices depending on the level of emissions.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.beehive.govt.nz/speech/energy-strategy-delivers-sustainable-energy-system |title= Energy strategy delivers sustainable energy system |last=Parker |first=David |work= Speech notes for launch of NZ Energy Strategy |publisher= New Zealand Government |date=11 October 2007 |accessdate=26 November 2007}}</ref> However, the incoming National government quickly [[Table (parliamentary procedure)|table]]d legislation to repeal various of these measures, such as obligatory targets for [[biofuel]] percentages,<ref>{{Cite web |url= http://www.beehive.govt.nz/release/biofuel+obligation+law+repealed|title= Biofuel Obligation Law Repealed|accessdate=8 January 2009 |publisher= New Zealand Government |date= 17 December 2008}}</ref> a ban on construction of new fossil fueled generation plants<ref>{{Cite web |url= http://www.beehive.govt.nz/release/thermal+ban+repeal|title= Thermal Ban Repealed|accessdate=8 January 2009 |publisher= New Zealand Government|date= 16 December 2008}}</ref> and a ban on future sales of [[incandescent light bulb]]s.<ref>{{Cite web |url= http://www.beehive.govt.nz/release/light+bulb+ban+ended|title= Light bulb ban ended|accessdate=8 January 2009 |publisher= New Zealand Government|date= 16 December 2008}}</ref>\n\nOn 1 January 2010, the energy sector was required to report greenhouse gas emissions under the [[New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme]] (NZETS).

Each offer covers a future half-hour period (called a trading period) and is an offer to generate a specified quantity at that time in return for a nominated price. The System Operator (Transpower) uses a scheduling, pricing and dispatch (SPD) system to rank offers, submitted through WITS, in order of price, and selects the lowest-cost combination of offers (bids) to satisfy demand.\n\nThe market pricing principle is known as bid-based security-constrained economic dispatch with [[Electricity market#Bid-based, security-constrained, economic dispatch with nodal prices|nodal prices]].\n\nThe highest-priced bid offered by a generator required to meet demand for a given half-hour sets the spot price for that trading period.\n\nElectricity spot prices can vary significantly across trading periods, reflecting factors such as changing demand (e.g. lower prices in summer when demand is subdued) and supply (e.g. higher prices when hydro lakes and inflows are below average). Spot prices can also vary significantly across locations, reflecting electrical losses and constraints on the transmission system (e.g. higher prices in locations further from generating stations).\n\n==Generation==\n[[File:New Zealand electricity generation by fuel type, 1974\u20132019.png|thumb|New Zealand electricity generation by fuel type, 1974\u20132019]]\n{{see also|List of power stations in New Zealand}}\n\nIn 2017, New Zealand generated 42,911 [[watt hour|gigawatt-hours]] (GWh) of electricity with hydroelectricity making up just over half of this.

The [[Tongariro Power Scheme]] consists of water taken from the catchments of the Whangaehu, Rangitikei, Whanganui and Tongariro Rivers passing through two powerhouses (Tokaanu and Rangipo) before being deposited in [[Lake Taupo]]. The scheme is operated by Genesis Energy and has an installed capacity of 360&nbsp;MW. The [[Waikato River]] Scheme, operated by [[Mercury Energy]], consists of nine powerhouses on the river between Lake Taupo and [[Hamilton, New Zealand|Hamilton]], generating 3650&nbsp;GWh annually.\n\nOther smaller hydroelectricity facilities and schemes are scattered around both islands of mainland New Zealand.\n\nHydroelectric schemes have largely shaped hinterland New Zealand. Towns including [[Mangakino]], [[Turangi]], [[Twizel, New Zealand|Twizel]] and [[Otematata]] originally were founded for workers on the construction of hydroelectric schemes and their families. The hydroelectric reservoirs of [[Lake Ruataniwha]] and [[Lake Karapiro]] are world-class rowing venues, with the latter having hosted the 1978 and the [[2010 World Rowing Championships]]. Other schemes have shaped political New Zealand. In the 1970s, the original plans to raise Lake Manapouri for the Manapouri station were scrapped after major protests. Later in the 1980s, protests were made against the creation of [[Lake Dunstan]] behind the Clyde Dam, which would flood the [[Cromwell Gorge]] and part of [[Cromwell, New Zealand|Cromwell]] township, destroying many fruit orchards and the main street of Cromwell. However, the project was given the go ahead and Lake Dunstan was filled in 1992\u201393.\n\nHydroelectricity generation has remained relatively steady since 1993 \u2013 the only major hydroelectricity projects since then was the completion of the second Manapouri tailrace tunnel in 2002, increasing the station from 585&nbsp;MW to 750&nbsp;MW, and due to resource consent the station increases further to 800&nbsp;MW.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.meridianenergy.co.nz/what-we-do/our-power-stations/hydro/manapouri-hydro-station/ |title=Manapouri hydro station |first= |last= |publisher=Meridian Energy  |year=2012 |accessdate=27 May 2012}}</ref> No major new hydroelectric projects have been committed as of December 2011, but there are proposals for further developments on the Waitaki and Clutha Rivers, and on the West Coast of the South Island.\n\n===Geothermal===\n[[File:Wairakei Geothermal Power Plant.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Wairakei]] geothermal power plant.]]\n{{main|Geothermal power in New Zealand}}\nNew Zealand lies on the [[Pacific Ring of Fire]], creating favourable geological conditions for the exploitation of [[geothermal power]]. Geothermal fields have been located across New Zealand, but at present, most geothermal power is generated within the [[Taupo Volcanic Zone]] \u2013 an area in the North Island stretching from [[Mount Ruapehu]] in the south to [[Whakaari / White Island|White Island]] in the north. As at December 2012, the installed capacity of geothermal power was 723&nbsp;MW, and in 2013, geothermal generated 6,053&nbsp;GWh of electricity \u2013 15% of the country's electricity generation that year.<ref name=\"Energy2014\" />\n\nThe majority of New Zealand's geothermal power is generated north of [[Lake Taupo]]. Eight stations generate electricity here, including [[Wairakei Power Station]], New Zealand's oldest (1958) and largest (176&nbsp;MW) geothermal power station, and the world's second large-scale geothermal power facility. Also in this area are [[Nga Awa Purua]], which is home to the world's largest geothermal turbine at 147&nbsp;MW<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thinkgeoenergy.com/archives/4619|title=NZ Hosting Largest Geothermal Turbine at Nga Awa Purua|date=6 May 2010|publisher=ThinkGeoenergy}}</ref> (although the plant only generates 140&nbsp;MW); and [[Ohaaki Power Station|Ohaaki]], which has a 105-metre tall [[hyperboloid]] natural draft [[cooling tower]]: the only one of its kind in New Zealand. A significant amount of geothermal electricity is also generated near [[Kawerau]] in the eastern Bay of Plenty, and a small amount is generated near [[Kaikohe]] in [[Northland Region|Northland]].\n\nMuch of New Zealand's geothermal power potential still lies untapped, with the [[New Zealand Geothermal Association]] estimating an installation capacity (using only existing technology) of around 3,600&nbsp;MW.<ref name=\"POT\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nzgeothermal.org.nz/geothermal_energy/geothermal_development.asp |title=Development Potential |publisher=New Zealand Geothermal Association |accessdate=2008-02-23 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080202191318/http://www.nzgeothermal.org.nz/geothermal_energy/geothermal_development.asp |archivedate=2 February 2008 |url-status=dead |df=dmy }}</ref>\n\n===Wind===\n[[File:Windturbine.jpg|thumb|left|The 255\u00a0kW demonstration wind turbine installed at Brooklyn, [[Wellington]]]]\n{{main|Wind power in New Zealand}}\nAccording to a 2018 report published by the New Zealand government, wind generation provided 5% of the electricity supply for 2017.

The country is in the path of the [[Roaring Forties]], strong and constant westerly winds, and the funneling effect of [[Cook Strait]] and the [[Manawatu Gorge]] increase the resource's potential. \nThese effects make the Lower [[North Island]] the main region for wind generation. \nAbout 70 percent of the nation's current installed capacity lies within this region, with some turbines have a [[capacity factor]] of over 50 percent in this area.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/news/article.cfm?c_id=3&objectid=10730825|title=Wellington winds too windy for wind farm|last=Bradley|first=Grant Bradley, Grant|date=2011-06-07|work=NZ Herald|access-date=2018-03-25|language=en-NZ|issn=1170-0777}}</ref>\n\nElectricity was first generated by wind in New Zealand in 1993, by a 225&nbsp;kW demonstration turbine in the Wellington suburb of Brooklyn. The first commercial wind farm was established in 1996 \u2013 the [[Hau Nui Wind Farm]], 22&nbsp;km southeast of [[Martinborough]] had seven turbines and generated 3.85&nbsp;MW. The Tararua Wind Farm was first commissioned in 1999 with 32&nbsp;MW of generating capacity, gradually expanding over the next eight years to 161&nbsp;MW \u2013 the largest wind farm in New Zealand. Other major wind farms include [[Te Apiti Wind Farm|Te Apiti]], [[Project West Wind|West Wind]] and [[White Hill Wind Farm|White Hill]].\n\nWind power in New Zealand shares the difficulties typical to other nations (uneven wind strengths, ideal locations often remote from power demand areas). New Zealand wind farms provide on average a 45% [[capacity factor]] (in other words, wind farms in New Zealand can produce more than double their average energy during periods of maximum useful wind strengths). The Tararua Wind Farm averages slightly more than this.<ref name=\"TICK\"/> The New Zealand Energy Efficiency and Conservation Authority figures indicate that wind power is also expected to operate at maximum capacity for around 4,000 hours a year, much more than for example the approximately 2,000 hours (Germany) to 3,000 hours (Scotland, Wales, Western Ireland) found in European countries.<ref name=\"TICK\"/>\n\n===Fossil fuels===\n[[File:Huntly Power Station.JPG|thumb|right|[[Huntly Power Station]] on the Waikato River. The 1435&nbsp;MW facility burns coal and gas, and is the country's largest power station.]]\n\nFossil fuels, specifically coal, oil and gas, produced 10,383&nbsp;GWh of electricity in 2013 \u2013 25% of all electricity generated that year. This was split into 8,143&nbsp;GWh by gas, 2,238&nbsp;GWh by coal, and 3&nbsp;GWh by oil. Total combined installed capacity in 2012 was 2,974&nbsp;MW. The North Island generates nearly all of New Zealand's fossil-fuelled electricity.<ref name=\"Energy2014\" />\n\nUp until the 1950s, fossil-fuelled stations were small-scale and usually fuelled by coal or coal by-products, providing electricity to cities yet to be connected to hydro schemes and to provide additional support to such schemes. Large-scale coal-fired generation came in 1958 with the establishment of the 210&nbsp;MW [[Meremere Power Station]]. Oil-fired stations such as Otahuhu A, Marsden A&B, and New Plymouth were commissioned in the late 1960s and early 1970s. The discovery of natural gas off the Taranaki coast, and the oil crises of the 1970s, saw oil-fueled stations converted to gas operation or mothballed, while gas-fired stations proliferated, especially in Taranaki and Auckland, well into the 2000s. Only in recent years has coal made a comeback, as Taranaki gas has slowly depleted.\n\nToday, there are three major fossil-fuelled stations in New Zealand. Smaller gas- and coal-fuelled industrial generators are found across New Zealand and especially in Auckland, Waikato, Bay of Plenty, and Taranaki. Genesis Energy's [[Huntly Power Station]] in northern Waikato is New Zealand's largest power station \u2013 with 1000&nbsp;MW of coal- and gas-fired generators and 435&nbsp;MW of gas only generators, it supplies around 17% of the country's electricity.<ref name=\"HUNT\">{{cite web|url=http://www.genesisenergy.co.nz/genesis/generation/our-thermal-plants/en/our-thermal-plants_home.cfm |title=Huntly Power Station |publisher=[[Genesis Energy Limited|Genesis Energy]] |accessdate=26 July 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080525080031/http://www.genesisenergy.co.nz/genesis/generation/our-thermal-plants/en/our-thermal-plants_home.cfm |archivedate=25 May 2008 |url-status=dead |df=dmy }}</ref> A gas-fired power station exists in Taranaki at [[Stratford Power Station|Stratford]] (585&nbsp;MW). [[Whirinaki Power Station|Whirinaki]] is a 155&nbsp;MW [[diesel engine|diesel]]-fired station north of [[Napier, New Zealand|Napier]], providing backup generation for periods when generation is not otherwise available, such as when plants break down, or during dry seasons where there is limited water available for hydroelectricity generation.\n\nDiesel-fuelled generation using internal combustion engines is popular in hinterland New Zealand where the national network doesn't reach, such as on offshore islands, alpine huts, sparsely populated areas and isolated homes and farm sheds. Diesel fuel suitable for generators is readily available across the country at [[petrol stations]] \u2013 diesel is not taxed at the petrol pump in New Zealand, and instead diesel-powered vehicles pay Road User Charges based on their gross tonnage and distance travelled.\n\nAs of 2012 none of the power generators appear to be committed to the construction of any new [[fossil-fuel power station|fossil-fuelled power stations]]. However, for several years there have been two unactioned but reasonably well defined proposals for gas-fired power stations with 880&nbsp;MW of generating capacity in the Auckland area.

The interwar years saw the first major construction of a national network of 110&nbsp;kV lines connecting towns and cities to hydroelectric schemes. By 1940, the transmission network stretched from Whangarei to Wellington in the North Island, and Christchurch to Greymouth and Invercargill in the South Island. Nelson and Marlborough, the last regions, joined the national grid in 1955. The 220&nbsp;kV network began in the early 1950s, connecting the Waikato River dams to Auckland and Wellington, and Roxburgh Dam to Christchurch. The two islands were joined together by the [[HVDC Inter-Island]] link in 1965. The first 400&nbsp;kV transmission line was completed between Whakamaru Dam on the Waikato River and Brownhill substation east of Auckland in 2012, but presently is operated at 220&nbsp;kV.\n\n===Existing grid===\nThe backbone of the grid in each island is the network of 220&nbsp;kV transmission lines.  These lines connect the larger cities and power users with the major power stations. Lower capacity 110&nbsp;kV, 66&nbsp;kV and 50&nbsp;kV transmission lines connect smaller towns and cities and smaller power stations, and are connected to the 220&nbsp;kV core grid through points of interconnection at major transmission substations. These stations include [[Otahuhu Power Station|Otahuhu]] and [[Penrose, New Zealand|Penrose]] in Auckland, [[Whakamaru Power Station|Whakamaru]], [[Wairakei Power Station|Wairakei]] and [[Bunnythorpe]] in the central North Island, [[Haywards]] in Wellington, [[Islington, New Zealand|Islington]] and [[Bromley, New Zealand|Bromley]] in Christchurch, and [[Twizel, New Zealand|Twizel]] and [[Benmore Dam|Benmore]] in the Waitaki Valley.\n\nThe grid today has ageing infrastructure, and increasing demand is placing significant loads on some parts of the network. Transpower is currently upgrading existing lines and substations to ensure supply security.\n\nInvestments in new transmission are now regulated by the Commerce Commission. In a news release in January 2012, the Commerce Commission reported that Transpower was planning to invest $5 billion over the next 10 years in upgrades of critical infrastructure.<ref name=comcom>{{cite web |url= http://www.comcom.govt.nz/electricity-media-releases/detail/2012/commerce-commission-finalises-input-methodology-for-approving-transpower-s-national-grid-spending/|title= Commerce Commission finalises input methodology for approving Transpower's national grid spending|publisher=Commerce Commission |date= 31 January 2012 |accessdate= 24 April 2012}}</ref>\n\nSince 2006, Transpower has spent nearly $2 billion reinforcing the supply into and around Auckland.

In 2014, a new 220&nbsp;kV cable was commissioned between Pakuranga and Albany (via Penrose, Hobson Street and Wairau Road), forming a second high-voltage route between northern and southern Auckland.\n\n===HVDC Inter-Island===\n{{main|HVDC Inter-Island}}\nThe [[HVDC Inter-Island]] scheme is New Zealand's only [[high voltage direct current]] (HVDC) system, and links the North and South Island grids together.\n\nThe link connects the South Island converter station at the [[Benmore Dam]] in southern [[Canterbury, New Zealand|Canterbury]] with the North Island converter station at [[Haywards]] substation in the [[Hutt Valley]] via a 610&nbsp;km long overhead bipolar HVDC line with [[Submarine power cable|submarine cables]] across [[Cook Strait]].\n\nThe HVDC link was commissioned in 1965 as a \u00b1250&nbsp;kV, 600&nbsp;MW bipolar HVDC scheme using [[mercury-arc valve]] converters, and was originally designed to transfer surplus South Island hydroelectric power northwards to the more populous North Island. In 1976, the control system of the original scheme was modified to allow power to be sent in the reverse direction, from Haywards to Benmore.<ref name=Taylor>{{cite book |author=Taylor, Peter|title= White Diamonds North: 25 Years' Operation of the Cook Strait Cable 1965\u20131990|location=Wellington|publisher=Transpower|year=1990|isbn=0-908893-00-0 |pages=109 pages}}</ref>\n[[File:Pole 2 Thyristor Valve.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|right|Haywards Pole 2 thyristor valve during maintenance shutdown]]\nThe HVDC link provides North Island consumers with access to the South Island's large hydro generation capacity, which may be important for the North Island during peak winter periods. For South Island consumers, the HVDC link provides access to the North Island's thermal generation capacity, which is important for the South Island during dry periods. Without the HVDC link, more generation would be needed in both the North and South Islands. In addition, the HVDC link is essential for the electricity market, as it allows generators in the North and South Islands to compete, putting downward pressure on prices and minimising the need to invest in costly new generating stations. The HVDC link also plays an important part in allowing renewable energy sources to be managed between the two islands.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.gridnewzealand.co.nz/f4689,69348739/Chapter_6_Grid_Backbone.pdf|title= 2012 Annual Planning Report: Chapter 6 \u2013 Grid Backbone|publisher= Transpower|date= March 2012|accessdate= 5 April 2012}}{{Dead link|date=August 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nIn 1992, the original mercury-arc equipment was paralleled to create a single pole (Pole 1), and a new thyristor-based pole (Pole 2) was commissioned alongside it. The transmission lines and submarine cables were also upgraded to double the link's maximum capacity to 1240&nbsp;MW. The mercury-arc valve converter equipment was partially decommissioned in 2007, and fully decommissioned in August 2012. New thyristor converter stations (known as Pole 3) were commissioned on 30 May 2013 to replace the mercury arc converters.

Large industrial companies, such as [[New Zealand Steel]] at Glenbrook, the [[Tasman Mill|Tasman Pulp and Paper Mill]] at Kawerau, and the [[Tiwai Point Aluminium Smelter]] near Bluff, draw directly from Transpower substations and not the local lines companies' local grids.\n\nDistribution of electricity to local consumers is the responsibility of one of 29 local line companies. Each company supplies electricity to a set geographic area based on the grid exit points they draw from.\n\nThe line companies are:\n\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Alpine Energy]]\n* [[Aurora Energy (New Zealand)|Aurora Energy]]\n* [[Buller Electricity]]\n* [[Centralines]]\n* [[Counties Power]]\n* [[Eastland Network]]\n* [[Electra Limited|Electra]]\n* [[Electricity Ashburton|EA Networks]]\n* [[Electricity Invercargill]]\n* [[Horizon Energy Distribution]]\n* [[The Lines Company]]\n* [[MainPower]]\n* [[Marlborough Lines Limited|Marlborough Lines]]\n* [[Nelson Electricity]]\n* [[Network Tasman]]\n* [[Network Waitaki]]\n* [[Northpower]]\n* [[Orion New Zealand Limited|Orion]]\n* [[OtagoNet]]\n* [[The Power Company Limited|The Power Company]]\n* [[Powerco]]\n* [[Scanpower]]\n* [[Top Energy]]\n* [[Unison Networks]]\n* [[Vector Limited|Vector]]\n* [[Waipa Networks]]\n* [[WEL Networks]]\n* [[Wellington Electricity]]\n* [[Westpower]]\n{{div col end}}\n\nIn most areas, the local lines company operates a subtransmission network, connecting the GXP to zone substations. At the zone substation (or at the GXP if there is no subtransmission network), the voltage is stepped down to distribution voltage. Three-phase distribution is available in all urban and most rural areas. Single- or two-phase distribution utilising only two phases or [[single wire earth return]] systems are used in outlying and remote rural areas with light loads. Local pole-mounted or ground-mounted [[distribution transformer]]s step-down the electricity from distribution voltage to the New Zealand [[mains voltage]] of 230/400&nbsp;volts (phase-to-earth/phase-to-phase) for use in homes and businesses.\n\nSubtransmission is typically at 33&nbsp;kV, 50&nbsp;kV, 66&nbsp;kV or 110&nbsp;kV, although parts of Auckland isthmus use 22&nbsp;kV subtransmission. Distribution is typically at 11&nbsp;kV, although some rural areas and high-density urban areas use 22&nbsp;kV distribution, and some urban areas (e.g. Dunedin) use 6.6&nbsp;kV distribution.\n\n==Isolated areas==\nNew Zealand's national electricity network covers the majority of both the North and South Islands.

Renewable energy sources are limited, but they are being actively investigated in order to increase the sustainability of the island's power supply, and reduce the cost.\n*[[Chatham Islands]]. Power on Chatham Island is provided by two 200&nbsp;kW wind turbines that provide most of the power on the island while diesel generators provide the rest, with fuel brought from the mainland.\n\nMany other schemes exist on offshore islands that have permanent or temporary habitation, mostly generators or small renewable systems. An example is the ranger / research station on [[Little Barrier Island]], where twenty 175 watt photovoltaic panels provide the mainstay for local needs, with a diesel generator for backup.<ref name=\"EnergyQuarterlyMarch2010\">{{cite web|title=New Zealand Energy Quarterly, March 2010|date=16 June 2010|url=http://www.med.govt.nz/sectors-industries/energy/energy-modelling/publications/new-zealand-energy-quarterly/previous-editions/2010-2012/NZEQ-Mar-2010.pdf/view|accessdate=12 May 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Consumption==\n[[File:New Zealand electricity consumption 1974\u20132019.png|thumb|New Zealand electricity consumption 1974\u20132019]]\nIn 2017, New Zealand consumed a total of 39,442&nbsp;GWh of electricity.

Rural areas were particular beneficiaries of subsidies for electrical grid systems, where supply was provided to create demand, with the intention of modernising the countryside. The results were notable \u2013 in the 1920s, electricity use increased at a rate of 22% per year. In fact, the 'load building' programmes were so successful that shortages started to occur from 1936 on, though a large number of new power stations built in the 1950s enabled supply to catch up again.<ref name=\"NZHA88\" />\n\nAfter the massive construction programmes had created a substantial supply of energy not dependent on international fossil fuel prices, New Zealand became less frugal with its energy use. While in 1978, its energy consumption (as expressed against economic output) hovered around the average of all [[OECD]] countries, during the 1980s New Zealand dropped far behind, increasing its energy use per economic unit by over 25%, while other nations slowly reduced their energy usage levels. Based on this economic comparison, in 1991 it was the second-least energy-efficient country out of 41 OECD countries.<ref name=\"NZHA98\">''New Zealand Historical Atlas'' \u2013 McKinnon, Malcolm (Editor); David Bateman, 1997, Plate 98</ref>\n\nAll of the government's energy assets originally came under the [[New Zealand Ministry of Works|Public Works Department]]. From 1946, the management of generation and transmission came under a new department, the State Hydro-Electric Department (SHD), renamed in 1958 as the New Zealand Electricity Department (NZED). In 1978, the Electricity Division of the Ministry of Energy assumed responsibility for electricity generation, transmission, policy advice and regulation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ea.govt.nz/about-us/functions/background-to-governance-and-regulation/ |title=Background to Governance and Regulation, Electricity Authority |accessdate=2011-09-26 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110811110313/http://www.ea.govt.nz/about-us/functions/background-to-governance-and-regulation/ |archivedate=11 August 2011 |df=dmy }}</ref> Distribution and retailing was the responsibility of local electric power boards (EPBs) or municipal electricity departments (MEDs).\n\nNew Zealand's electrical energy generation, previously state-owned as in most countries, was corporatised, deregulated and partly sold off over the last two decades of the twentieth century, following a model typical in the Western world. However, much of the generation and retail sectors, as well as the entire transmission sector, remains under government ownership as [[State-owned enterprises of New Zealand|state-owned enterprises]].\n\nThe [[Fourth Labour Government of New Zealand|Fourth Labour Government]] corporatised the Electricity Division as a [[State-owned enterprises of New Zealand|State Owned Enterprise]] in 1987, as the [[Electricity Corporation of New Zealand]] (ECNZ), which traded for a period as Electricorp. The [[Fourth National Government of New Zealand|Fourth National Government]] went further with the Energy Companies Act 1992, requiring EPBs and MEDs to become commercial companies in charge of distribution and retailing.\n\nIn 1994, ECNZ's transmission business was split off as [[Transpower New Zealand Limited|Transpower]]. In 1996, ECNZ was split again, with a new separate generation business, [[Contact Energy]], being formed. The Fourth National Government privatised [[Contact Energy]] in 1999. From 1 April 1999, the remainder of ECNZ was split again, with the major assets formed into three new state-owned enterprises (Mighty River Power (now [[Mercury Energy]]), [[Genesis Energy Limited|Genesis Energy]] and [[Meridian Energy]]) and with the minor assets being sold off. At the same time, local power companies were required to separate distribution and retailing, with the retail side of the business sold off, mainly to generation companies.\n\n==Organisation==\nNew Zealand's electricity sector is split into six distinct parts:\n* '''Generation''' \u2013 Generation companies generate electricity at power stations, selling the electricity generated via the wholesale market to retailers while physical electricity is injected into either transmission lines (grid-connected generation) or distribution lines (embedded generation). Numerous companies generate power, but 92 percent of the generation sector is dominated by five companies: [[Contact Energy]], [[Genesis Energy Limited|Genesis Energy]], [[Meridian Energy]], [[Mercury Energy]] and [[Trustpower]].\n* '''Transmission''' \u2013 [[Transpower New Zealand|Transpower]] operates the national transmission network, consisting of 11,000&nbsp;km of high voltage lines interconnecting generating power stations with grid exit points to supply distribution networks and large industrial consumers (direct consumers) in each of New Zealand's two main islands. A 611&nbsp;km [[high voltage direct current]] link ([[HVDC Inter-Island]]) connects the two islands' transmission networks together.\n* '''Distribution''' \u2013 Distribution companies operate 150,000&nbsp;km of medium and low-voltage lines interconnecting grid exit points with consumers and embedded generation. There are 29 distribution companies each serving a set geographic area.\n* '''Retail''' \u2013 Retail companies buy electricity from generators and on-sell it to consumers.

The [[Tongariro Power Scheme]] consists of water taken from the catchments of the Whangaehu, Rangitikei, Whanganui and Tongariro Rivers passing through two powerhouses (Tokaanu and Rangipo) before being deposited in [[Lake Taupo]]. The scheme is operated by Genesis Energy and has an installed capacity of 360&nbsp;MW. The [[Waikato River]] Scheme, operated by [[Mercury Energy]], consists of nine powerhouses on the river between Lake Taupo and [[Hamilton, New Zealand|Hamilton]], generating 3650&nbsp;GWh annually.\n\nOther smaller hydroelectricity facilities and schemes are scattered around both islands of mainland New Zealand.\n\nHydroelectric schemes have largely shaped hinterland New Zealand. Towns including [[Mangakino]], [[Turangi]], [[Twizel, New Zealand|Twizel]] and [[Otematata]] originally were founded for workers on the construction of hydroelectric schemes and their families. The hydroelectric reservoirs of [[Lake Ruataniwha]] and [[Lake Karapiro]] are world-class rowing venues, with the latter having hosted the 1978 and the [[2010 World Rowing Championships]]. Other schemes have shaped political New Zealand. In the 1970s, the original plans to raise Lake Manapouri for the Manapouri station were scrapped after major protests. Later in the 1980s, protests were made against the creation of [[Lake Dunstan]] behind the Clyde Dam, which would flood the [[Cromwell Gorge]] and part of [[Cromwell, New Zealand|Cromwell]] township, destroying many fruit orchards and the main street of Cromwell. However, the project was given the go ahead and Lake Dunstan was filled in 1992\u201393.\n\nHydroelectricity generation has remained relatively steady since 1993 \u2013 the only major hydroelectricity projects since then was the completion of the second Manapouri tailrace tunnel in 2002, increasing the station from 585&nbsp;MW to 750&nbsp;MW, and due to resource consent the station increases further to 800&nbsp;MW.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.meridianenergy.co.nz/what-we-do/our-power-stations/hydro/manapouri-hydro-station/ |title=Manapouri hydro station |first= |last= |publisher=Meridian Energy  |year=2012 |accessdate=27 May 2012}}</ref> No major new hydroelectric projects have been committed as of December 2011, but there are proposals for further developments on the Waitaki and Clutha Rivers, and on the West Coast of the South Island.\n\n===Geothermal===\n[[File:Wairakei Geothermal Power Plant.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Wairakei]] geothermal power plant.]]\n{{main|Geothermal power in New Zealand}}\nNew Zealand lies on the [[Pacific Ring of Fire]], creating favourable geological conditions for the exploitation of [[geothermal power]].

The country is in the path of the [[Roaring Forties]], strong and constant westerly winds, and the funneling effect of [[Cook Strait]] and the [[Manawatu Gorge]] increase the resource's potential. \nThese effects make the Lower [[North Island]] the main region for wind generation. \nAbout 70 percent of the nation's current installed capacity lies within this region, with some turbines have a [[capacity factor]] of over 50 percent in this area.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/news/article.cfm?c_id=3&objectid=10730825|title=Wellington winds too windy for wind farm|last=Bradley|first=Grant Bradley, Grant|date=2011-06-07|work=NZ Herald|access-date=2018-03-25|language=en-NZ|issn=1170-0777}}</ref>\n\nElectricity was first generated by wind in New Zealand in 1993, by a 225&nbsp;kW demonstration turbine in the Wellington suburb of Brooklyn. The first commercial wind farm was established in 1996 \u2013 the [[Hau Nui Wind Farm]], 22&nbsp;km southeast of [[Martinborough]] had seven turbines and generated 3.85&nbsp;MW. The Tararua Wind Farm was first commissioned in 1999 with 32&nbsp;MW of generating capacity, gradually expanding over the next eight years to 161&nbsp;MW \u2013 the largest wind farm in New Zealand. Other major wind farms include [[Te Apiti Wind Farm|Te Apiti]], [[Project West Wind|West Wind]] and [[White Hill Wind Farm|White Hill]].\n\nWind power in New Zealand shares the difficulties typical to other nations (uneven wind strengths, ideal locations often remote from power demand areas). New Zealand wind farms provide on average a 45% [[capacity factor]] (in other words, wind farms in New Zealand can produce more than double their average energy during periods of maximum useful wind strengths). The Tararua Wind Farm averages slightly more than this.<ref name=\"TICK\"/> The New Zealand Energy Efficiency and Conservation Authority figures indicate that wind power is also expected to operate at maximum capacity for around 4,000 hours a year, much more than for example the approximately 2,000 hours (Germany) to 3,000 hours (Scotland, Wales, Western Ireland) found in European countries.<ref name=\"TICK\"/>\n\n===Fossil fuels===\n[[File:Huntly Power Station.JPG|thumb|right|[[Huntly Power Station]] on the Waikato River. The 1435&nbsp;MW facility burns coal and gas, and is the country's largest power station.]]\n\nFossil fuels, specifically coal, oil and gas, produced 10,383&nbsp;GWh of electricity in 2013 \u2013 25% of all electricity generated that year. This was split into 8,143&nbsp;GWh by gas, 2,238&nbsp;GWh by coal, and 3&nbsp;GWh by oil. Total combined installed capacity in 2012 was 2,974&nbsp;MW. The North Island generates nearly all of New Zealand's fossil-fuelled electricity.<ref name=\"Energy2014\" />\n\nUp until the 1950s, fossil-fuelled stations were small-scale and usually fuelled by coal or coal by-products, providing electricity to cities yet to be connected to hydro schemes and to provide additional support to such schemes. Large-scale coal-fired generation came in 1958 with the establishment of the 210&nbsp;MW [[Meremere Power Station]]. Oil-fired stations such as Otahuhu A, Marsden A&B, and New Plymouth were commissioned in the late 1960s and early 1970s. The discovery of natural gas off the Taranaki coast, and the oil crises of the 1970s, saw oil-fueled stations converted to gas operation or mothballed, while gas-fired stations proliferated, especially in Taranaki and Auckland, well into the 2000s. Only in recent years has coal made a comeback, as Taranaki gas has slowly depleted.\n\nToday, there are three major fossil-fuelled stations in New Zealand. Smaller gas- and coal-fuelled industrial generators are found across New Zealand and especially in Auckland, Waikato, Bay of Plenty, and Taranaki. Genesis Energy's [[Huntly Power Station]] in northern Waikato is New Zealand's largest power station \u2013 with 1000&nbsp;MW of coal- and gas-fired generators and 435&nbsp;MW of gas only generators, it supplies around 17% of the country's electricity.<ref name=\"HUNT\">{{cite web|url=http://www.genesisenergy.co.nz/genesis/generation/our-thermal-plants/en/our-thermal-plants_home.cfm |title=Huntly Power Station |publisher=[[Genesis Energy Limited|Genesis Energy]] |accessdate=26 July 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080525080031/http://www.genesisenergy.co.nz/genesis/generation/our-thermal-plants/en/our-thermal-plants_home.cfm |archivedate=25 May 2008 |url-status=dead |df=dmy }}</ref> A gas-fired power station exists in Taranaki at [[Stratford Power Station|Stratford]] (585&nbsp;MW). [[Whirinaki Power Station|Whirinaki]] is a 155&nbsp;MW [[diesel engine|diesel]]-fired station north of [[Napier, New Zealand|Napier]], providing backup generation for periods when generation is not otherwise available, such as when plants break down, or during dry seasons where there is limited water available for hydroelectricity generation.\n\nDiesel-fuelled generation using internal combustion engines is popular in hinterland New Zealand where the national network doesn't reach, such as on offshore islands, alpine huts, sparsely populated areas and isolated homes and farm sheds. Diesel fuel suitable for generators is readily available across the country at [[petrol stations]] \u2013 diesel is not taxed at the petrol pump in New Zealand, and instead diesel-powered vehicles pay Road User Charges based on their gross tonnage and distance travelled.\n\nAs of 2012 none of the power generators appear to be committed to the construction of any new [[fossil-fuel power station|fossil-fuelled power stations]]. However, for several years there have been two unactioned but reasonably well defined proposals for gas-fired power stations with 880&nbsp;MW of generating capacity in the Auckland area. Both the proposed [[Rodney Power Station]] (Genesis Energy) near Helensville and the proposed [[Otahuhu Power Station]] C plant (Contact Energy) have [[resource consent]]s.\n\n===Other sources===\n\n==== Solar ====\n{{main|Solar power in New Zealand}}\nAs of January 2019 the installed solar generation capacity of 90.1MW represented just 1% of New Zealand generation capacity.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.emi.ea.govt.nz/Retail/Reports|title=Installed distributed generation trends|publisher=Electricity Authority}}</ref>\n\n====Marine====\n{{main|Ocean power in New Zealand}}\n[[New Zealand]] has large [[ocean energy]] resources but does not yet generate any power from them.

The interwar years saw the first major construction of a national network of 110&nbsp;kV lines connecting towns and cities to hydroelectric schemes. By 1940, the transmission network stretched from Whangarei to Wellington in the North Island, and Christchurch to Greymouth and Invercargill in the South Island. Nelson and Marlborough, the last regions, joined the national grid in 1955. The 220&nbsp;kV network began in the early 1950s, connecting the Waikato River dams to Auckland and Wellington, and Roxburgh Dam to Christchurch. The two islands were joined together by the [[HVDC Inter-Island]] link in 1965. The first 400&nbsp;kV transmission line was completed between Whakamaru Dam on the Waikato River and Brownhill substation east of Auckland in 2012, but presently is operated at 220&nbsp;kV.\n\n===Existing grid===\nThe backbone of the grid in each island is the network of 220&nbsp;kV transmission lines.  These lines connect the larger cities and power users with the major power stations. Lower capacity 110&nbsp;kV, 66&nbsp;kV and 50&nbsp;kV transmission lines connect smaller towns and cities and smaller power stations, and are connected to the 220&nbsp;kV core grid through points of interconnection at major transmission substations. These stations include [[Otahuhu Power Station|Otahuhu]] and [[Penrose, New Zealand|Penrose]] in Auckland, [[Whakamaru Power Station|Whakamaru]], [[Wairakei Power Station|Wairakei]] and [[Bunnythorpe]] in the central North Island, [[Haywards]] in Wellington, [[Islington, New Zealand|Islington]] and [[Bromley, New Zealand|Bromley]] in Christchurch, and [[Twizel, New Zealand|Twizel]] and [[Benmore Dam|Benmore]] in the Waitaki Valley.\n\nThe grid today has ageing infrastructure, and increasing demand is placing significant loads on some parts of the network. Transpower is currently upgrading existing lines and substations to ensure supply security.\n\nInvestments in new transmission are now regulated by the Commerce Commission. In a news release in January 2012, the Commerce Commission reported that Transpower was planning to invest $5 billion over the next 10 years in upgrades of critical infrastructure.<ref name=comcom>{{cite web |url= http://www.comcom.govt.nz/electricity-media-releases/detail/2012/commerce-commission-finalises-input-methodology-for-approving-transpower-s-national-grid-spending/|title= Commerce Commission finalises input methodology for approving Transpower's national grid spending|publisher=Commerce Commission |date= 31 January 2012 |accessdate= 24 April 2012}}</ref>\n\nSince 2006, Transpower has spent nearly $2 billion reinforcing the supply into and around Auckland. A 400&nbsp;kV-capable transmission line was completed in 2012, linking [[Whakamaru]] to Brownhill substation in Whitford, east of Auckland, with 220&nbsp;kV cables linking Brownhill to [[Pakuranga]]. In 2014, a new 220&nbsp;kV cable was commissioned between Pakuranga and Albany (via Penrose, Hobson Street and Wairau Road), forming a second high-voltage route between northern and southern Auckland.\n\n===HVDC Inter-Island===\n{{main|HVDC Inter-Island}}\nThe [[HVDC Inter-Island]] scheme is New Zealand's only [[high voltage direct current]] (HVDC) system, and links the North and South Island grids together.\n\nThe link connects the South Island converter station at the [[Benmore Dam]] in southern [[Canterbury, New Zealand|Canterbury]] with the North Island converter station at [[Haywards]] substation in the [[Hutt Valley]] via a 610&nbsp;km long overhead bipolar HVDC line with [[Submarine power cable|submarine cables]] across [[Cook Strait]].\n\nThe HVDC link was commissioned in 1965 as a \u00b1250&nbsp;kV, 600&nbsp;MW bipolar HVDC scheme using [[mercury-arc valve]] converters, and was originally designed to transfer surplus South Island hydroelectric power northwards to the more populous North Island. In 1976, the control system of the original scheme was modified to allow power to be sent in the reverse direction, from Haywards to Benmore.<ref name=Taylor>{{cite book |author=Taylor, Peter|title= White Diamonds North: 25 Years' Operation of the Cook Strait Cable 1965\u20131990|location=Wellington|publisher=Transpower|year=1990|isbn=0-908893-00-0 |pages=109 pages}}</ref>\n[[File:Pole 2 Thyristor Valve.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|right|Haywards Pole 2 thyristor valve during maintenance shutdown]]\nThe HVDC link provides North Island consumers with access to the South Island's large hydro generation capacity, which may be important for the North Island during peak winter periods. For South Island consumers, the HVDC link provides access to the North Island's thermal generation capacity, which is important for the South Island during dry periods. Without the HVDC link, more generation would be needed in both the North and South Islands. In addition, the HVDC link is essential for the electricity market, as it allows generators in the North and South Islands to compete, putting downward pressure on prices and minimising the need to invest in costly new generating stations. The HVDC link also plays an important part in allowing renewable energy sources to be managed between the two islands.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.gridnewzealand.co.nz/f4689,69348739/Chapter_6_Grid_Backbone.pdf|title= 2012 Annual Planning Report: Chapter 6 \u2013 Grid Backbone|publisher= Transpower|date= March 2012|accessdate= 5 April 2012}}{{Dead link|date=August 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nIn 1992, the original mercury-arc equipment was paralleled to create a single pole (Pole 1), and a new thyristor-based pole (Pole 2) was commissioned alongside it. The transmission lines and submarine cables were also upgraded to double the link's maximum capacity to 1240&nbsp;MW. The mercury-arc valve converter equipment was partially decommissioned in 2007, and fully decommissioned in August 2012. New thyristor converter stations (known as Pole 3) were commissioned on 30 May 2013 to replace the mercury arc converters. Further work to Pole 2 brought the link's capacity to 1200\u00a0MW by the end of the year.<ref>https://www.transpower.co.nz/news/new-hvdc-pole-3-commissioned</ref>\n\n== Distribution ==\n[[File:PoleMountedDistributionTransformerNZ.jpg|thumb|right|A distribution transformer mounted on a power pole in Wellington]]\nElectricity from Transpower's national grid is distributed to local lines companies and large industrial users via 180 grid exit points (GXPs) at 147 locations. Large industrial companies, such as [[New Zealand Steel]] at Glenbrook, the [[Tasman Mill|Tasman Pulp and Paper Mill]] at Kawerau, and the [[Tiwai Point Aluminium Smelter]] near Bluff, draw directly from Transpower substations and not the local lines companies' local grids.\n\nDistribution of electricity to local consumers is the responsibility of one of 29 local line companies. Each company supplies electricity to a set geographic area based on the grid exit points they draw from.\n\nThe line companies are:\n\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Alpine Energy]]\n* [[Aurora Energy (New Zealand)|Aurora Energy]]\n* [[Buller Electricity]]\n* [[Centralines]]\n* [[Counties Power]]\n* [[Eastland Network]]\n* [[Electra Limited|Electra]]\n* [[Electricity Ashburton|EA Networks]]\n* [[Electricity Invercargill]]\n* [[Horizon Energy Distribution]]\n* [[The Lines Company]]\n* [[MainPower]]\n* [[Marlborough Lines Limited|Marlborough Lines]]\n* [[Nelson Electricity]]\n* [[Network Tasman]]\n* [[Network Waitaki]]\n* [[Northpower]]\n* [[Orion New Zealand Limited|Orion]]\n* [[OtagoNet]]\n* [[The Power Company Limited|The Power Company]]\n* [[Powerco]]\n* [[Scanpower]]\n* [[Top Energy]]\n* [[Unison Networks]]\n* [[Vector Limited|Vector]]\n* [[Waipa Networks]]\n* [[WEL Networks]]\n* [[Wellington Electricity]]\n* [[Westpower]]\n{{div col end}}\n\nIn most areas, the local lines company operates a subtransmission network, connecting the GXP to zone substations. At the zone substation (or at the GXP if there is no subtransmission network), the voltage is stepped down to distribution voltage. Three-phase distribution is available in all urban and most rural areas. Single- or two-phase distribution utilising only two phases or [[single wire earth return]] systems are used in outlying and remote rural areas with light loads. Local pole-mounted or ground-mounted [[distribution transformer]]s step-down the electricity from distribution voltage to the New Zealand [[mains voltage]] of 230/400&nbsp;volts (phase-to-earth/phase-to-phase) for use in homes and businesses.\n\nSubtransmission is typically at 33&nbsp;kV, 50&nbsp;kV, 66&nbsp;kV or 110&nbsp;kV, although parts of Auckland isthmus use 22&nbsp;kV subtransmission. Distribution is typically at 11&nbsp;kV, although some rural areas and high-density urban areas use 22&nbsp;kV distribution, and some urban areas (e.g. Dunedin) use 6.6&nbsp;kV distribution.\n\n==Isolated areas==\nNew Zealand's national electricity network covers the majority of both the North and South Islands. There are also a number of offshore islands which are connected to the national grid. [[Waiheke Island]], New Zealand's most populous offshore island, is supplied electricity via submarine cables between [[Maraetai]] and the island.<ref name=\"Vector_AMP\">{{cite web |url= http://vector.co.nz/sites/vector.co.nz/files/Vector%20-%20Electricity%20AMP.pdf |title= Electricity Asset Management Plan 2012 \u2013 2022 |publisher= [[Vector Limited]] |date= April 2012 |accessdate= 8 May 2012 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20130116053743/http://www.vector.co.nz/sites/vector.co.nz/files/Vector%20-%20Electricity%20AMP.pdf |archive-date= 16 January 2013 |url-status= dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://waihekewind.co.nz/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=10&Itemid=11 |title= Why Waiheke Island should have a wind farm? \u2013 Waiheke Initiative for Sustainable Energy |date= 2011-02-11}}</ref> [[Arapaoa Island]] and [[d'Urville Island (New Zealand)|d'Urville Island]], both in the [[Marlborough Sounds]], are supplied via overhead spans across [[Tory Channel]] and [[French Pass]] respectively.\n\nHowever, many offshore islands and some parts of the South Island are not connected to the national grid and operate independent generation systems, mainly due to the difficulty of building lines from other areas. These places include:\n\n*[[Great Barrier Island]]. The largest population in New Zealand without a reticulated electricity supply.

The area around Haast and extending south to Jackson Bay is not connected to the rest of New Zealand. It operates from a hydroelectric scheme on the Turnbull River with diesel backup.\n*[[Milford Sound]]. Electricity is generated via a small hydroelectric scheme operating off Bowen Falls with a diesel backup.\n*[[Deep Cove, New Zealand|Deep Cove]], [[Doubtful Sound]]. The small community at Deep Cove at the head of Doubtful Sound operates off a hydro scheme, although during the construction of the second Manapouri Tailrace Tunnel a high voltage cable was installed connecting this tiny settlement with the Manapouri Power Station.\n*[[Stewart Island / Rakiura]]. This island's power supply for a population of 300/400 people is entirely diesel generated. Renewable energy sources are limited, but they are being actively investigated in order to increase the sustainability of the island's power supply, and reduce the cost.\n*[[Chatham Islands]]. Power on Chatham Island is provided by two 200&nbsp;kW wind turbines that provide most of the power on the island while diesel generators provide the rest, with fuel brought from the mainland.\n\nMany other schemes exist on offshore islands that have permanent or temporary habitation, mostly generators or small renewable systems. An example is the ranger / research station on [[Little Barrier Island]], where twenty 175 watt photovoltaic panels provide the mainstay for local needs, with a diesel generator for backup.<ref name=\"EnergyQuarterlyMarch2010\">{{cite web|title=New Zealand Energy Quarterly, March 2010|date=16 June 2010|url=http://www.med.govt.nz/sectors-industries/energy/energy-modelling/publications/new-zealand-energy-quarterly/previous-editions/2010-2012/NZEQ-Mar-2010.pdf/view|accessdate=12 May 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Consumption==\n[[File:New Zealand electricity consumption 1974\u20132019.png|thumb|New Zealand electricity consumption 1974\u20132019]]\nIn 2017, New Zealand consumed a total of 39,442&nbsp;GWh of electricity.
