Pupils who mainly live in the [[Great Bridge, West Midlands|Great Bridge]], [[Tibbington]], [[Horseley Heath]] and [[Tipton Green]] areas of the town attend the school.\n\nIt is situated on Alexandra Road (B4517) towards [[Toll End]] (and [[West Bromwich]]) and near the crossroads with Church Lane (B4163) and the fire station. It is about a mile from the [[A41 road|A41]]/[[A461 road|A461]] roundabout at Great Bridge, and about a half-mile north of [[Dudley Port railway station]].\n\n==History==\n===Grammar school===\nThe school was opened in 1927 as Tipton Central School. It served the local area as a grammar school for boys and girls, and its title was soon altered to '''Tipton County Grammar School''', situated on Alexandra Road. It was administered by the South-West Divisional Executive of Staffordshire Education Committee (based in [[Dudley]]), then West Bromwich Education Committee with around 700 boys and girls. The buildings were expanded in 1962 to include a new school hall, kitchen, dining hall, swimming pool, gymnasium and Science classrooms. This building was demolished in the mid-1990s following further extensions to the site.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tiptoncivicsociety.co.uk/brief-history-of-tipton.php |title=Brief History of Tipton |publisher=Tiptoncivicsociety.co.uk |accessdate=26 November 2011 |url-status = dead|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120915100741/http://www.tiptoncivicsociety.co.uk/brief-history-of-tipton.php |archivedate=15 September 2012 |df= }}</ref>\n\n===Comprehensive===\nTipton Grammar merged with nearby [[Park Lane Secondary School, Tipton|Park Lane Secondary School]] in Queens Road in September 1969 and became a comprehensive school.

In most jurisdictions, a marriage certificate is issued by a government official only after the [[civil registration]] of the marriage.\n\nIn some jurisdictions, especially in the United States, a marriage certificate is the official record that two people have undertaken a marriage ceremony. This includes jurisdictions where [[marriage license]]s do not exist. In other jurisdictions, a marriage license serves a dual purpose of granting permission for a marriage to take place and then endorsing the same document to record the fact that the marriage has been performed.\n\nA marriage certificate may be required for a number of reasons. It may be required as evidence of change of a party's name, on issues of [[Legitimacy (family law)|legitimacy]] of a child, during divorce proceedings, or as part of a genealogical history, besides other purposes.\n\n==Countries==\n===Australia===\n{{see also|Marriage in Australia|Same-sex marriage in Australia}}\nThough marriage in [[Australia]] is [[Marriage Act 1961 (Australia)|regulated under federal law]], the [[civil registration|registration]] of marriages takes place under the respective [[States and territories of Australia|state or territory]] laws, generally through an agency named \"Registry of Births, Deaths and Marriages\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.australia.gov.au/information-and-services/family-and-community/births-deaths-and-marriages-registries|title=Births, deaths and marriages registries \u2013 australia.gov.au|first=Digital Transformation |last=Agency |website=Australia.gov.au |accessdate=21 May 2018}}</ref> or similar, and marriage certificates are issued by these agencies. Under Federal law, a certificate is issued at the time of marriage by a celebrant, for forwarding to the state or territory registry. A similar (sometimes cut-down) document is often given to the couple on the day of the marriage, it is generally handwritten.  While legally valid as proof of marriage, is not generally acceptable as an official document. However, the state or territory marriage certificate is considered to be an acceptable and secure [[Identity documents of Australia|secondary identity document]] especially for the purposes of change of name, and needs to be obtained separately for a fee generally some time after the marriage. This document can be verified electronically by the [[Attorney-general of Australia]]'s Document Verification Service.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.ag.gov.au/RightsAndProtections/IdentitySecurity/Pages/DocumentVerificationService.aspx |title=Archived copy |access-date=7 April 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170321081501/https://www.ag.gov.au/RightsAndProtections/IdentitySecurity/Pages/DocumentVerificationService.aspx |archive-date=21 March 2017 |url-status=dead  }}</ref> States and territories sometimes market commemorative marriage certificates, which generally have no official document status.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bdm.nsw.gov.au/Pages/marriages/marriage-certificate.aspx#commemorative|title=Marriage certificate |website=Bdm.nsw.gov.au|accessdate=21 May 2018}}</ref>\n\nState and territory issued certificates are on [[A4 paper]] and provide: Date and place of marriage, full names, occupations, addresses, marital status (never validly married, divorced, widow/er), birth date & place, age, father's name, mother's maiden name of each the couple, the celebrant, witness names (generally two), the registrar official of the state or territory authority, and the date of registration. The registrar's signature and seal is printed/embossed on the certificate along with a number, and date of issue of certificate.\n\nMarriage certificates are not generally used in Australia, other than to prove change-of-name, and proof of marital status in a divorce hearing. Some visa categories require a certificate (where a partner is to be associated with a primary applicant),<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.border.gov.au/Trav/Visa-1/300- |title=Archived copy |access-date=7 April 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170407233805/https://www.border.gov.au/Trav/Visa-1/300- |archive-date=7 April 2017 |url-status=dead  }}</ref> however there are similar categories of partner visas that do not.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.border.gov.au/Trav/Visa-1/801-|title=Partner visa (subclasses 820 and 801)|website=Border.gov.au|accessdate=21 May 2018}}</ref>\n\nSince 2018, Australian federal law has recognised [[Recognition of same-sex unions in Australia|same-sex marriages]].<ref name=\"MarriageAct9Dec2017V1\">{{cite web |url=https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/C2017C00382 |title=Marriage Act|date=9 December 2017 |work=Federal Register of Legislation|quote=Refer to Part 1 (Subsection 8) of the Act}}</ref> These marriages are registrable and documented in the conventional way. \n\n===England and Wales===\nOn 1 July 1837 civil registration was introduced in England and Wales, providing a central record of all births, deaths and marriages. A Registrar General was appointed with overall responsibility and the country was divided into registration districts, each controlled by a superintendent registrar. Under this system, all marriage ceremonies have been certified by the issuing of a marriage certificate whose details are also stored centrally. From that date, marriage ceremonies could be performed, and certificates issued either by a clergyman of the [[Church of England]], in a parish church, or by a civil registrar in a civil register office. Marriages performed according to the ceremonies of [[Quakers]] and [[Jew]]s also continued to be recognised as legal marriages, and certificates were issued.\n\nThe marriage certificate itself is given to the couple who have married. Copies are made in two registers: one is retained by the church or register office; the other, when the entire register is full, is sent to the superintendent registrar of the registration district.

In other jurisdictions, a marriage license serves a dual purpose of granting permission for a marriage to take place and then endorsing the same document to record the fact that the marriage has been performed.\n\nA marriage certificate may be required for a number of reasons.

Under Federal law, a certificate is issued at the time of marriage by a celebrant, for forwarding to the state or territory registry. A similar (sometimes cut-down) document is often given to the couple on the day of the marriage, it is generally handwritten.  While legally valid as proof of marriage, is not generally acceptable as an official document. However, the state or territory marriage certificate is considered to be an acceptable and secure [[Identity documents of Australia|secondary identity document]] especially for the purposes of change of name, and needs to be obtained separately for a fee generally some time after the marriage.

A Registrar General was appointed with overall responsibility and the country was divided into registration districts, each controlled by a superintendent registrar. Under this system, all marriage ceremonies have been certified by the issuing of a marriage certificate whose details are also stored centrally. From that date, marriage ceremonies could be performed, and certificates issued either by a clergyman of the [[Church of England]], in a parish church, or by a civil registrar in a civil register office. Marriages performed according to the ceremonies of [[Quakers]] and [[Jew]]s also continued to be recognised as legal marriages, and certificates were issued.\n\nThe marriage certificate itself is given to the couple who have married. Copies are made in two registers: one is retained by the church or register office; the other, when the entire register is full, is sent to the superintendent registrar of the registration district. Every quarter, the minister or civil registrar prepares a further copy of all the marriage entries and sends them to the Registrar General.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo6/12-13-14/76/contents|title=Marriage Act 1949|website=Legislation.gov.uk|accessdate=21 May 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe certificate lists the date of the marriage, and the full names of both spouses.

He debuted for them in 1919 and became Kiwi number 125<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Kiwis Roll of Honour\n| publisher = New Zealand Rugby League\n| url =https://nzrl.co.nz/kiwis-home/past-kiwis/\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. He played his club rugby league for the [[Grafton Athletic]] and [[Newton Rangers]] teams in the [[Auckland Rugby League]] competition. He later moved to [[Tauranga]] and played for Tauranga and [[Bay of Plenty Steamers|Bay of Plenty]] at rugby union including against the touring [[Springbok national rugby union team|Springbok]] team in 1921.\n\n==Early Life==\nGeorge Iles grew up in [[Christchurch]]. He was the son of Harriet and Albert Iles, whose parents had come to New Zealand in one of the first \u201cfour ships\u201d which brought settlers to [[Canterbury, New Zealand|Canterbury]]<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Obituary/Mr Albert Iles\n| page = 2\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume LV, Issue 9359\n| date = 1926-12-09\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19261209.2.9\n| accessdate = 2020-04-09}}</ref>.\nAlbert was a successful sportsman in his own right captaining the Sydenham Football Club in the 1880s and representing [[Canterbury Rugby Football Union|Canterbury]] and [[Rugby Southland|Southland]] for several years. He was also a champion runner. In 1912 the family moved to [[Auckland]] where they lived until 1919 and it was during these years that George made a name for himself as a rugby league player.\n\n==Rugby League Playing Career==\nGeorge Iles began his playing career for [[Grafton Athletic]] with his name first appearing in a team list for their second grade team in 1914 along with his brother Arthur Iles <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Under League Rules/Fixtures and Teams/Grafton Club\n| page = 10\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LI, Issue 15621\n| date = 1914-05-29\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19140529.2.132.1\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. The following season he debuted for the Grafton senior team and played in the [[1915 Auckland Rugby League season|Auckland first grade competition]]. He was fortunate to play alongside the likes of New Zealand rugby league legends [[Karl Ifwersen]] and [[Dougie McGregor]], the later having already played for the [[New Zealand national rugby union team|All Blacks]] rugby team<ref>{{cite news\n| title = The League Game Notes and Comments\n| page = 10\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LII, Issue 15915\n| date = 1915-05-12\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19150512.2.124.1\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. Grafton were to win the Auckland title [[1915 Auckland Rugby League season|this season]].\n\nBoth George and Arthur were to transfer to the [[Newton Rangers]] team for the [[1916 Auckland Rugby League season|1916 season]]. Newton struggled and finished last however Iles did score 7 out of Newton\u2019s 20 tries making him the second highest try scorer for the entire competition. The following year he went even better scoring 12 tries and leading the try scorer lists in the [[1917 Auckland Rugby League season|1917 competition]].\n\nIn 1918 Iles scored 4 tries for Newton and was also elected secretary of the club at their annual meeting<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Newton Rangers Club\n| page = 7\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LV, Issue 16814\n| date = 1918-04-03\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19180403.2.60\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. He gained his first representative jersey when he was selected for the [[Auckland rugby league team|Auckland]] team for, at that time, a very rare representative fixture. During the war years the [[Auckland Rugby League]] had deliberately played almost no representative matches. The match was against [[Canterbury rugby league team|Canterbury]] and played at the [[Auckland Domain]] in front of 10,000 spectators. Auckland won 45-9 with Iles scoring a try in the corner \u201cafter a cross-field run\u201d <ref>{{cite news\n| title =Auckland Defeats Canterbury/Forty-Five Points to Nine\n| page =3\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LV, Issue 16956\n| date = 1918-09-16\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19180916.2.15.1\n| accessdate = 2019-08-10}}</ref>.\n\nOnce again in [[1919 Auckland Rugby League season|1919]] Iles was a prolific try scorer for Newton notching 10 tries in total including tries in the Roope Rooster semi final against [[Ponsonby Ponies|Ponsonby United]], and the semi final replay against the same opponents when the first match was abandoned near the end after Ponsonby fans encroached on the field and refused to move.

The first after receiving a pass from [[Bert Laing]] and \u201ccutting in neatly and scoring\u201d, while his second saw him picking up the ball in the open \u201coutpacing the opposition and swerving past McCarthy [to score] a good try\u201d<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Representative Match/Auckland V Hawke\u2019s Bay\n| page =9\n| publisher =New Zealand Herald, Volume LVI, Issue 17235\n| date = 1911-08-11\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19190811.2.111.1\n| accessdate = 2019-08-18}}</ref>.\n\nIles was to make his [[New Zealand national rugby league team|New Zealand]] debut two weeks later.

Iles was listed to play in the reserves a week later for the Auckland team to play Australia but he did not take the field in an 8-32 loss.\n\n==Rugby Union Playing Career==\nIn 1920 George Iles moved to Tauranga with his family. There because rugby league was barely played he largely played rugby union over the following decade for Tauranga and the [[Bay of Plenty Steamers|Bay of Plenty]] representative team. In July 1920 he played for Tauranga against Grammar Old Boys. It was said \u201cof the Tauranga team the Isles [sic] brothers, three quarters, played well, and if supported by other members of the back division, would have made things a bit more awkward for the visitors. They both handled the ball well\u201d <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Grammar Old Boys v Tauranga\n| page = 8\n| publisher = Observer, Volume XL, Issue 45\n| date = 1920-07-10\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/TO19200710.2.13.1\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. In September of 1920 Iles made a return to [[Eden Park]], this time in a Bay of Plenty rugby jersey where they were defeated 17-34 to Auckland. Iles set up Bay of Plenty\u2019s first try and then scored two himself<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Auckland V Bay of Plenty/The Visitors Defeated\n| page = 7\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LVII, Issue 17580\n| date = 1920-09-20\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19200920.2.106\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>.\n\nIn 1921 Iles continued to play for Tauranga, scoring a try in a match against Mercury Bay <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Match at Tauranga\n| page = 9\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LVIII, Issue 17836\n| date = 1921-07-18\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19210718.2.110.1\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>.

However on the 16th of August he was selected to play for Bay of Plenty against the touring Springbok team<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Local and General\n| page = 2\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume 49, Issue 7773\n| date = 1921-08-16\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19210816.2.5\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. The match was played at [[Rotorua]] with 5,000 spectators present to witness the Springboks win by 17 points to 9. Iles helped set up the first try to David Werahiko Borell after he initiated a \u201cnice attack\u201d and he did the same for their second and final try when Montgomery \u201csent the ball across to Iles who opened up splendidly, and the ball came across to Borell, who scored near the corner\u201d <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Springboks Beat Bay of Plenty\n| page = 3\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume 49, Issue 7781\n| date = 1921-08-25\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19210825.2.13\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>.\n\nDespite these fine rugby achievements it appears that Iles had not forgotten his rugby league background. He was part of an effort to establish rugby league in the [[Tauranga]] area in 1922. On April 12 he wrote a letter to the [[Bay of Plenty Times]] about the strength of the rugby league code in various places and was writing in response to a query about why rugby league had been started in the area by Mr. Phelan, a past member of the Tauranga rugby selection committee. Iles responded in a lengthy letter \u201cthe answer is the same as that to why the League game was first commenced \u2013 that is dissatisfaction with Rugby management\u201d, he went on to say \u201ctouching on the standard of play in League, as one who has played both codes I give it as my opinion that League is played on a far higher standard in [[Australia]] and [[Auckland]] than Rugby\u201d <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Public Opinion/Rival Codes\n| page = 4\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume L, Issue 7961\n| date = 1922-04-13\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19220413.2.27\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>.

At the end of the season on August 28 he wrote another letter suggesting a match between those players who had been selected for the Tauranga rugby union team and those who had not as there had evidently been some controversy over selections<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Football Challenge\n| page = 2\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume L, Issue 8075\n| date = 1922-08-29\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19220829.2.5.1\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. Then in September he again went on the attack, this time in response to the suggestion by rugby supporters that league players were being paid. He was writing as a member of Tauranga Rugby League and challenged \u201cany member of the Rugby Union to produce evidence of proof of any monetary benefits received by players or officers of the Tauranga Rugby League.

He debuted for them in 1919 and became Kiwi number 125<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Kiwis Roll of Honour\n| publisher = New Zealand Rugby League\n| url =https://nzrl.co.nz/kiwis-home/past-kiwis/\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. He played his club rugby league for the [[Grafton Athletic]] and [[Newton Rangers]] teams in the [[Auckland Rugby League]] competition. He later moved to [[Tauranga]] and played for Tauranga and [[Bay of Plenty Steamers|Bay of Plenty]] at rugby union including against the touring [[Springbok national rugby union team|Springbok]] team in 1921.\n\n==Early Life==\nGeorge Iles grew up in [[Christchurch]]. He was the son of Harriet and Albert Iles, whose parents had come to New Zealand in one of the first \u201cfour ships\u201d which brought settlers to [[Canterbury, New Zealand|Canterbury]]<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Obituary/Mr Albert Iles\n| page = 2\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume LV, Issue 9359\n| date = 1926-12-09\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19261209.2.9\n| accessdate = 2020-04-09}}</ref>.\nAlbert was a successful sportsman in his own right captaining the Sydenham Football Club in the 1880s and representing [[Canterbury Rugby Football Union|Canterbury]] and [[Rugby Southland|Southland]] for several years. He was also a champion runner. In 1912 the family moved to [[Auckland]] where they lived until 1919 and it was during these years that George made a name for himself as a rugby league player.\n\n==Rugby League Playing Career==\nGeorge Iles began his playing career for [[Grafton Athletic]] with his name first appearing in a team list for their second grade team in 1914 along with his brother Arthur Iles <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Under League Rules/Fixtures and Teams/Grafton Club\n| page = 10\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LI, Issue 15621\n| date = 1914-05-29\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19140529.2.132.1\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. The following season he debuted for the Grafton senior team and played in the [[1915 Auckland Rugby League season|Auckland first grade competition]]. He was fortunate to play alongside the likes of New Zealand rugby league legends [[Karl Ifwersen]] and [[Dougie McGregor]], the later having already played for the [[New Zealand national rugby union team|All Blacks]] rugby team<ref>{{cite news\n| title = The League Game Notes and Comments\n| page = 10\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LII, Issue 15915\n| date = 1915-05-12\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19150512.2.124.1\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. Grafton were to win the Auckland title [[1915 Auckland Rugby League season|this season]].\n\nBoth George and Arthur were to transfer to the [[Newton Rangers]] team for the [[1916 Auckland Rugby League season|1916 season]]. Newton struggled and finished last however Iles did score 7 out of Newton\u2019s 20 tries making him the second highest try scorer for the entire competition. The following year he went even better scoring 12 tries and leading the try scorer lists in the [[1917 Auckland Rugby League season|1917 competition]].\n\nIn 1918 Iles scored 4 tries for Newton and was also elected secretary of the club at their annual meeting<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Newton Rangers Club\n| page = 7\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LV, Issue 16814\n| date = 1918-04-03\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19180403.2.60\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. He gained his first representative jersey when he was selected for the [[Auckland rugby league team|Auckland]] team for, at that time, a very rare representative fixture. During the war years the [[Auckland Rugby League]] had deliberately played almost no representative matches. The match was against [[Canterbury rugby league team|Canterbury]] and played at the [[Auckland Domain]] in front of 10,000 spectators. Auckland won 45-9 with Iles scoring a try in the corner \u201cafter a cross-field run\u201d <ref>{{cite news\n| title =Auckland Defeats Canterbury/Forty-Five Points to Nine\n| page =3\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LV, Issue 16956\n| date = 1918-09-16\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19180916.2.15.1\n| accessdate = 2019-08-10}}</ref>.\n\nOnce again in [[1919 Auckland Rugby League season|1919]] Iles was a prolific try scorer for Newton notching 10 tries in total including tries in the Roope Rooster semi final against [[Ponsonby Ponies|Ponsonby United]], and the semi final replay against the same opponents when the first match was abandoned near the end after Ponsonby fans encroached on the field and refused to move.

His next appearance was against the Returned Soldiers team as part of the Peace Day celebration program. It was held at the Auckland Domain on July 20 and featured athletics, rugby union, rugby league, football, and hockey matches.

His last ever match in an Auckland jersey was played against [[Rugby League Hawkes Bay|Hawke\u2019s Bay]] at [[Eden Park]] on August 9 with 9,000 watching on. Iles scored two more tries. The first after receiving a pass from [[Bert Laing]] and \u201ccutting in neatly and scoring\u201d, while his second saw him picking up the ball in the open \u201coutpacing the opposition and swerving past McCarthy [to score] a good try\u201d<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Representative Match/Auckland V Hawke\u2019s Bay\n| page =9\n| publisher =New Zealand Herald, Volume LVI, Issue 17235\n| date = 1911-08-11\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19190811.2.111.1\n| accessdate = 2019-08-18}}</ref>.\n\nIles was to make his [[New Zealand national rugby league team|New Zealand]] debut two weeks later. He played all of his 4 matches for New Zealand in 4 consecutive weekends. New Zealand had sent a touring team to [[Australia]] where they had played 11 matches against various teams but no tests<ref>{{cite news\n| title = All Blacks Tour 1919\n| publisher = Rugby League Project\n| url = https://www.rugbyleagueproject.org/competitions/all-blacks-tour-1919/summary.html\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>.

Iles had played in a trial on May 14 to make the tour but was not selected.\n\nOn August 23 he played his first test for New Zealand at the [[Basin Reserve]] in [[Wellington]] and went down 21-44 in front of 8,000 spectators<ref>{{cite news\n| title = League Football/Australia V New Zealand\n| page = 7\n| publisher = Dominion, Volume 12, Issue 282\n| date = 1919-08-25\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/DOM19190825.2.88\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. Iles had a happier time of it in the second test which New Zealand won at Sydenham Park in [[Christchurch]]. Iles scored a try which was described \u201cfollowing an exchange of kicks between the two full-backs the New Zealanders swept down in a line and Iles got over\u201d, this made the score 21-2 to New Zealand.

Iles was listed to play in the reserves a week later for the Auckland team to play Australia but he did not take the field in an 8-32 loss.\n\n==Rugby Union Playing Career==\nIn 1920 George Iles moved to Tauranga with his family. There because rugby league was barely played he largely played rugby union over the following decade for Tauranga and the [[Bay of Plenty Steamers|Bay of Plenty]] representative team. In July 1920 he played for Tauranga against Grammar Old Boys. It was said \u201cof the Tauranga team the Isles [sic] brothers, three quarters, played well, and if supported by other members of the back division, would have made things a bit more awkward for the visitors. They both handled the ball well\u201d <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Grammar Old Boys v Tauranga\n| page = 8\n| publisher = Observer, Volume XL, Issue 45\n| date = 1920-07-10\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/TO19200710.2.13.1\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. In September of 1920 Iles made a return to [[Eden Park]], this time in a Bay of Plenty rugby jersey where they were defeated 17-34 to Auckland. Iles set up Bay of Plenty\u2019s first try and then scored two himself<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Auckland V Bay of Plenty/The Visitors Defeated\n| page = 7\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LVII, Issue 17580\n| date = 1920-09-20\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19200920.2.106\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>.\n\nIn 1921 Iles continued to play for Tauranga, scoring a try in a match against Mercury Bay <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Match at Tauranga\n| page = 9\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LVIII, Issue 17836\n| date = 1921-07-18\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19210718.2.110.1\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>.

However on the 16th of August he was selected to play for Bay of Plenty against the touring Springbok team<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Local and General\n| page = 2\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume 49, Issue 7773\n| date = 1921-08-16\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19210816.2.5\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. The match was played at [[Rotorua]] with 5,000 spectators present to witness the Springboks win by 17 points to 9. Iles helped set up the first try to David Werahiko Borell after he initiated a \u201cnice attack\u201d and he did the same for their second and final try when Montgomery \u201csent the ball across to Iles who opened up splendidly, and the ball came across to Borell, who scored near the corner\u201d <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Springboks Beat Bay of Plenty\n| page = 3\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume 49, Issue 7781\n| date = 1921-08-25\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19210825.2.13\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>.\n\nDespite these fine rugby achievements it appears that Iles had not forgotten his rugby league background. He was part of an effort to establish rugby league in the [[Tauranga]] area in 1922. On April 12 he wrote a letter to the [[Bay of Plenty Times]] about the strength of the rugby league code in various places and was writing in response to a query about why rugby league had been started in the area by Mr. Phelan, a past member of the Tauranga rugby selection committee. Iles responded in a lengthy letter \u201cthe answer is the same as that to why the League game was first commenced \u2013 that is dissatisfaction with Rugby management\u201d, he went on to say \u201ctouching on the standard of play in League, as one who has played both codes I give it as my opinion that League is played on a far higher standard in [[Australia]] and [[Auckland]] than Rugby\u201d <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Public Opinion/Rival Codes\n| page = 4\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume L, Issue 7961\n| date = 1922-04-13\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19220413.2.27\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. He was still playing rugby union through this period and played for Tauranga in a drawn match with Rangataua in June\n<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Rugby Union's Cup Matches Continued/Tauranga and Rangataua Play a Draw\n| page =2\n| publisher =Bay of Plenty Times, Volume L, Issue 8007\n| date = 1922-06-12\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19220612.2.5\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. At the end of the season on August 28 he wrote another letter suggesting a match between those players who had been selected for the Tauranga rugby union team and those who had not as there had evidently been some controversy over selections<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Football Challenge\n| page = 2\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume L, Issue 8075\n| date = 1922-08-29\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19220829.2.5.1\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. Then in September he again went on the attack, this time in response to the suggestion by rugby supporters that league players were being paid. He was writing as a member of Tauranga Rugby League and challenged \u201cany member of the Rugby Union to produce evidence of proof of any monetary benefits received by players or officers of the Tauranga Rugby League. If this can be done I will donate \u00a350 to any charity benefit. <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Football Matters\n| page = 2\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume LI, Issue 8102\n| date = 1922-09-29\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19220929.2.5.1\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>.\n\nHe captained Tauranga in a match against [[Rangitaiki]] which was won 12-5 with Iles involved prominently throughout the match\n<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Rugby Match Won by Tauranga/Good Game Against Rangitaiki Team\n| page =5\n| publisher =Bay of Plenty Times, Volume LIII, Issue 8935\n| date = 1925-07-20\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19250720.2.25\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>.\n\nIn 1926 Iles was playing rugby again and represented Tauranga against [[Hamilton, New Zealand|Hamilton]]<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Tauranga v Hamilton\n| page = 15\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LXIII, Issue 19373\n| date = 1926-07-07\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19260707.2.159\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>.

Snow falls in the interior, but is rare at sea level.<ref>{{cite book|url={{Google books|fRJtB2MNdJMC|page=471|plainurl=yes}}|title=Encyclopedia of the Antarctic|first=Beau|last=Riffenburgh|date=20 May 2018|publisher=Taylor & Francis|via=Google Books|isbn=978-0-415-97024-2}}</ref>\n\n{{Weather box\n|location = Gough Island (1961\u20131990, extremes 1956\u20131990)\n|single line = Y\n|metric first = Y\n|Jan record high C = 26.4\n|Feb record high C = 25.7\n|Mar record high C = 25.9\n|Apr record high C = 22.6\n|May record high C = 20.5\n|Jun record high C = 20.6\n|Jul record high C = 19.3\n|Aug record high C = 21.7\n|Sep record high C = 19.3\n|Oct record high C = 21.4\n|Nov record high C = 23.9\n|Dec record high C = 25.1\n|year record high C = 26.4\n|Jan high C = 17.2\n|Feb high C = 17.4\n|Mar high C = 16.9\n|Apr high C = 15.4\n|May high C = 13.7\n|Jun high C = 12.4\n|Jul high C = 11.5\n|Aug high C = 11.2\n|Sep high C = 11.5\n|Oct high C = 12.9\n|Nov high C = 14.9\n|Dec high C = 16.2\n|year high C = 14.3\n|Jan mean C = 13.9\n|Feb mean C = 14.4\n|Mar mean C = 13.9\n|Apr mean C = 12.8\n|May mean C = 11.3\n|Jun mean C = 10.0\n|Jul mean C = 9.1\n|Aug mean C = 8.9\n|Sep mean C = 8.9\n|Oct mean C = 10.1\n|Nov mean C = 11.9\n|Dec mean C = 13.2\n|year mean C = 11.5\n|Jan low C = 11.1\n|Feb low C = 11.6\n|Mar low C = 11.3\n|Apr low C = 10.4\n|May low C = 8.9\n|Jun low C = 7.6\n|Jul low C = 6.6\n|Aug low C = 6.5\n|Sep low C = 6.6\n|Oct low C = 7.8\n|Nov low C = 9.4\n|Dec low C = 10.3\n|year low C = 9.0\n|Jan record low C = 5.3\n|Feb record low C = 5.1\n|Mar record low C = 4.8\n|Apr record low C = 3.7\n|May record low C = 1.4\n|Jun record low C = 0.1\n|Jul record low C = -0.9\n|Aug record low C = -2.7\n|Sep record low C = 0.2\n|Oct record low C = 0.5\n|Nov record low C = 2.4\n|Dec record low C = 4.1\n|year record low C = -2.7\n|precipitation colour = green\n|Jan precipitation mm = 210\n|Feb precipitation mm = 183\n|Mar precipitation mm = 254\n|Apr precipitation mm = 276\n|May precipitation mm = 286\n|Jun precipitation mm = 310\n|Jul precipitation mm = 273\n|Aug precipitation mm = 304\n|Sep precipitation mm = 270\n|Oct precipitation mm = 249\n|Nov precipitation mm = 213\n|Dec precipitation mm = 241\n|unit precipitation days = 1.0 mm\n|Jan precipitation days = 16\n|Feb precipitation days = 13\n|Mar precipitation days = 18\n|Apr precipitation days = 19\n|May precipitation days = 21\n|Jun precipitation days = 22\n|Jul precipitation days = 23\n|Aug precipitation days = 21\n|Sep precipitation days = 20\n|Oct precipitation days = 18\n|Nov precipitation days = 16\n|Dec precipitation days = 18\n|year precipitation days = 225\n|Jan humidity = 81\n|Feb humidity = 82\n|Mar humidity = 82\n|Apr humidity = 82\n|May humidity = 82\n|Jun humidity = 83\n|Jul humidity = 83\n|Aug humidity = 83\n|Sep humidity = 81\n|Oct humidity = 81\n|Nov humidity = 81\n|Dec humidity = 81\n|year humidity = 82\n|Jan sun = 183.8\n|Feb sun = 148.8\n|Mar sun = 123.3\n|Apr sun = 95.6\n|May sun = 83.7\n|Jun sun = 60.4\n|Jul sun = 71.7\n|Aug sun = 87.5\n|Sep sun = 101.6\n|Oct sun = 128.5\n|Nov sun = 161.4\n|Dec sun = 182.9\n|year sun = 1429.2\n|source 1 = NOAA,<ref name=\"NOAA\">{{cite web\n| url = ftp://ftp.atdd.noaa.gov/pub/GCOS/WMO-Normals/TABLES/REG__I/UA/68906.TXT\n| title = Gough Island Climate Normals 1961\u22121990\n| publisher = National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\n| accessdate = November 21, 2013}}</ref> [[Deutscher Wetterdienst]] (extremes)<ref name = DWD>\n{{cite web\n| url = http://www.dwd.de/DWD/klima/beratung/ak/ak_689060_kt.pdf\n| title = Klimatafel von Gough Island / S\u00fcdatlantik / Gro\u00dfbritannien\n| work = Baseline climate means (1961\u20131990) from stations all over the world\n| publisher = Deutscher Wetterdienst\n| language = German\n| accessdate = November 18, 2016}}</ref>\n|source 2 = climate-charts.com<ref>{{cite web\n|url = http://www.climate-charts.com/Locations/u/UA68906.php\n|title = Climate Statistics for Gough Island, South Africa\n|date = 20 February 1998\n|access-date = 7 March 2012\n|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160820193201/http://www.climate-charts.com/Locations/u/UA68906.php\n|archive-date = 20 August 2016\n|url-status = dead\n}}</ref>\n|date=October 2014}}\n\n==Fauna and flora==\n[[File:Blechnum and Phylica.png|thumb|upright|The fern ''[[Blechnum]]'' and tree ''[[Phylica]]'' on Gough Island]]\nGough and [[Inaccessible Island]] are a protected [[wildlife reserve]], which has been designated a [[World Heritage Site]] by [[UNESCO]].<ref name=Unesco>{{Cite web|url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/740|title=Gough and Inaccessible Islands|accessdate=3 January 2017|publisher=UNESCO Organization}}</ref> It has been described as one of the least disrupted [[ecosystem]]s of its kind and one of the best shelters for nesting [[seabird]]s in the Atlantic.

The Commonwealth and MBTA began to purchase several lines, like the [[Lowell Line]] between Somerville and Wilmington, from the B&M.\n\nIn 1969 the B&M transported 24,000 passengers every weekday on four separate routes. Its yearly deficit was {{USD|3.2 million}}. A pool of 86 [[Budd Rail Diesel Car]]s provided the service.<ref>{{Dorin-Commuter|p=13}}</ref> B&M filed for bankruptcy protection in 1970.

However, the Commonwealth's support for rail operations began in the 1950s with contracted operations and subsidies to railroads providing commuter service, and more so in 1964 with the advent of MBTA.\n*The Commonwealth of Massachusetts pioneered the concept of \"Park and Ride\" by providing funds to construct the [[Route 128 Station]] on NH's Providence Line, at a location where the radial line intersected with [[Massachusetts Route 128]], the [[beltway]] encircling greater Boston. Route 128 Station was established 1953 by NH President [[Frederic C. Dumaine, Jr.]].

However, MBTA does not operate electric equipment on the Providence Line, as such equipment would be unusable on other lines.\n*As [[Big Dig]] environmental mitigation, MBTA invested heavily in the Commuter Rail system by restoring large sections of the Old Colony division, which was abandoned in 1959.

The attack was supported by intense ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' bombing that reduced much of the city to rubble. The fighting degenerated into [[Urban warfare|house-to-house]] fighting; both sides poured reinforcements into the city. By mid-November 1942, the Germans had pushed the Soviet defenders back at great cost into narrow zones along the west bank of the [[Volga River]].\n\nOn 19 November 1942, the [[Red Army]] launched [[Operation Uranus]], a two-pronged attack targeting the weaker [[Kingdom of Romania|Romanian]] and [[Kingdom of Hungary (1920-1946)|Hungarian]] armies protecting the German 6th Army's flanks.<ref>Beevor (1998: 239)</ref> The Axis forces on the flanks were overrun and the 6th Army was [[encirclement|cut off and surrounded]] in the Stalingrad area. [[Adolf Hitler]] ordered that the army stay in Stalingrad and make no attempt to break out; instead, attempts were made to supply the army by air and to break the encirclement from the outside. Heavy fighting continued for another two months. By the beginning of February 1943, the Axis forces in Stalingrad had exhausted their ammunition and food.

Elsewhere, the war had been progressing well: the [[Battle of the Atlantic|U-boat offensive]] in the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] had been very successful and [[Erwin Rommel]] had just captured [[Tobruk#Capture of Tobruk|Tobruk]].<ref name=\"Kershaw2000\">{{harvnb|Kershaw|2000|pp=}}</ref>{{Rp|522|date=June 2011}} In the east, they had stabilised their front in a line running from [[Leningrad]] in the north to [[Rostov-on-Don|Rostov]] in the south. There were a number of [[Salient (territory)|salients]], but these were not particularly threatening. Hitler was confident that he could master the [[Red Army]] after the winter of 1942, because even though [[Army Group Centre]] (''Heeresgruppe Mitte'') had suffered heavy losses west of [[Moscow]] the previous winter, 65% of its infantry had not been engaged and had been rested and re-equipped.

The initial objectives in the region around Stalingrad were the destruction of the industrial capacity of the city and the deployment of forces to block the [[Volga River]]. The river was a key route from the [[Caucasus]] and the [[Caspian Sea]] to central Russia. Its capture would disrupt commercial river traffic. The Germans cut the pipeline from the oilfields when they captured Rostov on 23 July. The capture of Stalingrad would make the delivery of [[Lend Lease]] supplies via the [[Persian Corridor]] much more difficult.<ref name=Shirer1990/>{{Rp|909|date=June 2011}}<ref>P.M.H.

Both sides began to attach propaganda value to the city, based on it bearing the name of the leader of the Soviet Union.

The German offensive started well. Soviet forces offered little resistance in the vast empty steppes and started streaming eastward. Several attempts to re-establish a defensive line failed when German units [[flanking maneuver|outflanked]] them. Two major pockets were formed and destroyed: the first, northeast of Kharkov, on 2 July, and a second, around [[Millerovo]], [[Rostov Oblast]], a week later. Meanwhile, the [[Second Army (Hungary)|Hungarian 2nd Army]] and the German 4th Panzer Army had launched an [[Battle of Voronezh (1942)|assault on Voronezh]], capturing the city on 5 July.\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 169-0952, Russland, bei Stalingrad, Offiziersbesprechung.jpg|thumb|Situation briefing near Stalingrad between a German company commander and a platoon leader]]\n\nThe initial advance of the 6th Army was so successful that Hitler intervened and ordered the 4th Panzer Army to join Army Group South (A) to the south. A massive [[traffic jam]] resulted when the 4th Panzer and the 1st Panzer both required the few roads in the area. Both armies were stopped dead while they attempted to clear the resulting mess of thousands of vehicles. The delay was long, and it is thought that it cost the advance at least one week. With the advance now slowed, Hitler changed his mind and reassigned the 4th Panzer Army back to the attack on Stalingrad.\n\nBy the end of July, the Germans had pushed the Soviets across the [[Don River, Russia|Don River]]. At this point, the Don and Volga Rivers are only {{convert|65|km|mi|abbr=on}} apart, and the Germans left their main supply depots west of the Don, which had important implications later in the course of the battle.

The Soviets burned large amounts of grain during their retreat in order to deny the enemy food. Paulus chose the grain elevator and silos as the symbol of Stalingrad for a patch he was having designed to commemorate the battle after a German victory.\n\n[[File:24.

Even the sewers were the sites of firefights. The Germans called this unseen [[urban warfare]] ''Rattenkrieg'' (\"Rat War\"),<ref>{{harvnb|Bellamy|2007|pp=514\u201317}}</ref> and bitterly joked about capturing the kitchen but still fighting for the living room and the bedroom.

Positions were taken individually, but the Germans were never able to capture the key crossing points along the river bank.

Toward the end of the battle, the gigantic [[railroad gun]] [[Dora (artillery)|nicknamed ''Dora'']] was brought into the area. The Soviets built up a large number of artillery batteries on the east bank of the Volga. This artillery was able to bombard the German positions or at least provide counter-battery fire.\n\nSnipers on both sides used the ruins to inflict casualties. The most famous [[Soviet sniper]] in Stalingrad was [[Vasily Zaitsev (sniper)|Vasily Zaytsev]],<ref>{{harvnb|Beevor|1998|pp=203\u201306}}</ref> with 225 confirmed kills during the battle.

The British historian [[Antony Beevor]] noted the \"sinister\" message from the Stalingrad Front's Political Department on 8 October 1942 that: \"The defeatist mood is almost eliminated and the number of treasonous incidents is getting lower\" as an example of the sort of coercion Red Army soldiers experienced under the Special Detachments (later to be renamed [[SMERSH]]).<ref name=\"Beevor2004\">{{harvnb|Beevor|2004|pp=}}</ref>{{Rp|154\u201368|date=June 2011}} On the other hand, Beevor noted the often extraordinary bravery of the Soviet soldiers in a battle that was only comparable to [[Battle of Verdun|Verdun]], and argued that terror alone cannot explain such self-sacrifice.<ref name=\"Beevor1998\"/>{{Rp|154\u201368|date=June 2011}} [[Richard Overy]] addresses the question of just how important the Red Army's coercive methods were to the Soviet war effort compared with other motivational factors such as hatred for the enemy. He argues that, though it is \"easy to argue that from the summer of 1942 the Soviet army fought because it was forced to fight,\" to concentrate solely on coercion is nonetheless to \"distort our view of the Soviet war effort.\"<ref>Overy, Richard.

These operations opened the Winter Campaign of 1942\u20131943 (19 November 1942 \u2013 3 March 1943), which involved some fifteen Armies operating on several fronts.

The Hungarian 2nd Army was given the task of defending a {{convert|200|km|mi|abbr=on}} section of the front north of Stalingrad between the Italian Army and [[Voronezh]]. This resulted in a very thin line, with some sectors where {{convert|1|\u2013|2|km|mi|abbr=on}} stretches were being defended by a single platoon. These forces were also lacking in effective anti-tank weapons.

The Soviet forces were allowed to retain bridgeheads on the right bank from which offensive operations could be quickly launched. These bridgeheads in retrospect presented a serious threat to Army Group B.<ref name=Shirer1990/>{{Rp|915|date=June 2011}}\n\nSimilarly, on the southern flank of the Stalingrad sector the front southwest of [[Kotelnikovo]] was held only by the Romanian 4th Army.

The northern flank was defended by Hungarian and Romanian units, often in open positions on the steppes. The natural line of defence, the Don River, had never been properly established by the German side. The armies in the area were also poorly equipped in terms of anti-tank weapons. The plan was to punch through the overstretched and weakly defended German flanks and surround the German forces in the Stalingrad region.\n\nDuring the preparations for the attack, [[Marshal of the Soviet Union|Marshal]] Zhukov personally visited the front and noticing the poor organisation, insisted on a one-week delay in the start date of the planned attack.<ref name=\"Beevor1998\"/>{{Rp|117|date=May 2009}} The operation was code-named \"Uranus\" and launched in conjunction with [[Operation Mars]], which was directed at [[Army Group Center]].

The preparations for the attack could be heard by the Romanians, who continued to push for reinforcements, only to be refused again. Thinly spread, deployed in exposed positions, outnumbered and poorly equipped, the [[Romanian Third Army|Romanian 3rd Army]], which held the northern flank of the German 6th Army, was overrun.\n\nBehind the front lines, no preparations had been made to defend key points in the rear such as [[Kalach-na-Donu|Kalach]]. The response by the ''Wehrmacht'' was both chaotic and indecisive. Poor weather prevented effective air action against the Soviet offensive.  Army Group B was in disarray and faced strong Soviet pressure across all its fronts.  Hence it was ineffective in relieving the 6th army.\n\nOn 20 November, a second Soviet offensive (two armies) was launched to the south of Stalingrad against points held by the Romanian [[4th Army Corps (Romania)|4th Army Corps]].

Hence Army Group A was never used to help relieve the Sixth Army.\n\n[[Army Group Don]] was formed under Field Marshal von Manstein. Under his command were the twenty German and two Romanian divisions encircled at Stalingrad, Adam's battle groups formed along the [[Chir River]] and on the Don bridgehead, plus the remains of the Romanian 3rd Army.<ref name=Adam/>{{rp|107, 113}}\n\nThe Red Army units immediately formed two defensive fronts: a [[circumvallation]] facing inward and a [[contravallation]] facing outward.

At a meeting shortly after the Soviet [[encirclement]], German army chiefs pushed for an immediate breakout to a new line on the west of the Don, but Hitler was at his Bavarian retreat of [[Obersalzberg]] in [[Berchtesgaden]] with the head of the ''Luftwaffe'', [[Hermann G\u00f6ring]]. When asked by Hitler, G\u00f6ring replied, after being convinced by [[Hans Jeschonnek]],<ref name=hayward98/>{{Rp|234|date=May 2009}} that the ''Luftwaffe'' could supply the 6th Army with an \"[[airbridge (logistics)|air bridge]].\" This would allow the Germans in the city to fight on temporarily while a relief force was assembled.<ref name=Shirer1990/>{{Rp|926|date=June 2011}} A similar plan had been used a year earlier at the [[Demyansk Pocket]], albeit on a much smaller scale: a corps at Demyansk rather than an entire army.<ref name=Adam/>{{rp|132}}\n\n[[File:Ju 52 approaching Stalingrad late 1942.jpg|thumb|A Ju 52 approaching Stalingrad]]\n\nThe director of ''Luftflotte'' 4, Wolfram von Richthofen, tried to get this decision overturned. The forces under the 6th Army were almost twice as large as a regular German army unit, plus there was also a corps of the 4th Panzer Army trapped in the pocket. The maximum 107 tonnes they could deliver a day \u2013 based on the number of available aircraft and with only the airfield at [[Pitomnik Airfield|Pitomnik]] to land at \u2013 was far less than the minimum 750 tonnes needed.<ref name=hayward98/><ref group=\"Note\">Shirer p. 926 says that \"Paulus radioed that they would need a minimum of 750 tons of supplies day flown in,\" while Craig pp. 206\u201307 quotes Zeitzler as pressing Goering about his boast that the Luftwaffe could airlift the needed supplies: \"Are you aware&nbsp;... how many daily sorties the army in Stalingrad will need?&nbsp;... Seven hundred tons! Every day!\"</ref> To supplement the limited number of [[Junkers Ju 52]] transports, the Germans pressed other aircraft into the role, such as the [[Heinkel He 177]] bomber (some bombers performed adequately \u2013 the [[Heinkel He 111]] proved to be quite capable and was much faster than the Ju 52). General Richthofen informed Manstein on 27 November of the small transport capacity of the Luftwaffe and the impossibility of supplying 300 tons a day by air. Manstein now saw the enormous technical difficulties of a supply by air of these dimensions. The next day he made a six-page situation report to the general staff. Based on the information of the expert Richthofen, he declared that contrary to the example of the pocket of Demyansk the permanent supply by air would be impossible. If only a narrow link could be established to Sixth Army, he proposed that this should be used to pull it out from the encirclement, and said that the Luftwaffe should instead of supplies deliver only enough ammunition and fuel for a breakout attempt. He acknowledged the heavy moral sacrifice that giving up Stalingrad would mean, but this would be made easier to bear by conserving the combat power of the Sixth Army and regaining the initiative.<ref>Kehrig, Manfred ''Stalingrad'', Stuttgart: Deutsche Verlags Anstalt, 1974 pp. 279, 311\u201312, 575.</ref> He ignored the limited mobility of the army and the difficulties of disengaging the Soviets. Hitler reiterated that the Sixth Army would stay at Stalingrad and that the air bridge would supply it until the encirclement was broken by a new German offensive.\n\nSupplying the 270,000 men trapped in the \"cauldron\" required 700 tons of supplies a day. That would mean 350 [[Ju 52]] flights a day into Pitomnik. At a minimum, 500 tons were required. However, according to Adam, \"On not one single day have the minimal essential number of tons of supplies been flown in.\"<ref name=Adam/>{{rp|119, 127, 131, 134}} The ''Luftwaffe'' was able to deliver an average of 85 tonnes of supplies per day out of an air transport capacity of 106 tonnes per day. The most successful day, 19 December, the ''Luftwaffe'' delivered 262 tonnes of supplies in 154 flights. The outcome of the airlift was the Luftwaffe's failure to provide its transport units with the tools they needed to maintain an adequate count of operational aircraft \u2013 tools that included airfield facilities, supplies, manpower, and even aircraft suited to the prevailing conditions. These factors, taken together, prevented the Luftwaffe from effectively employing the full potential of its transport forces, ensuring that they were unable to deliver the quantity of supplies needed to sustain the 6th Army.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Bates|first=Aaron|date=April 2016|title=For Want of the Means: A Logistical Appraisal of the Stalingrad Airlift|journal=The Journal of Slavic Military Studies|volume=29|issue=2|pages=298\u2013318|doi=10.1080/13518046.2016.1168137}}</ref>\n\nIn the early parts of the operation, fuel was shipped at a higher priority than food and ammunition because of a belief that there would be a breakout from the city.<ref name=walsh2000/>{{Rp|153|date=June 2009}} Transport aircraft also evacuated technical specialists and sick or wounded personnel from the besieged enclave.

On 23 December, the Soviet 24th Tank Corps, commanded by Major-General [[Vasily Badanov|Vasily Mikhaylovich Badanov]], reached nearby Skassirskaya and in the early morning of 24 December, [[Tatsinskaya Raid|the tanks reached Tatsinskaya]]. Without any soldiers to defend the airfield, it was abandoned under heavy fire; in a little under an hour, 108 Ju 52s and 16 [[Junkers Ju 86|Ju 86s]] took off for [[Novocherkassk]] \u2013 leaving 72 Ju 52s and many other aircraft burning on the ground. A new base was established some {{convert|300|km|mi|abbr=on}} from Stalingrad at [[Salsk]], the additional distance would become another obstacle to the resupply efforts. Salsk was abandoned in turn by mid-January for a rough facility at [[Zverevo]], near [[Shakhty]]. The field at Zverevo was attacked repeatedly on 18 January and a further 50 Ju 52s were destroyed. Winter weather conditions, technical failures, heavy Soviet [[anti-aircraft gun|anti-aircraft]] fire and fighter interceptions eventually led to the loss of 488 German aircraft.\n\nIn spite of the failure of the German offensive to reach the 6th Army, the air supply operation continued under ever more difficult circumstances. The 6th Army slowly starved. General [[Kurt Zeitzler|Zeitzler]], moved by their plight, began to limit himself to their slim rations at meal times. After a few weeks on such a diet, he had \"visibly lost weight\", according to [[Albert Speer]], and Hitler \"commanded Zeitzler to resume at once taking sufficient nourishment.\"<ref name=\"Speer\">{{cite book|last1=Speer|first1=Albert|title=Inside the Third Reich|date=1995|publisher=Weidenfeld & Nicolson|location=London|isbn=9781842127353|pages=343\u2013347}}</ref>\n\nThe toll on the ''Transportgruppen'' was heavy. 160 aircraft were destroyed and 328 were heavily damaged (beyond repair).

Operation Winter Storm (''Operation Wintergewitter''), the German attempt led by Erich von Manstein to relieve the trapped army from the south, was initially successful. By 18 December, the German Army had pushed to within 48&nbsp;km (30&nbsp;mi) of Sixth Army's positions. However the predictable nature of the relief operation brought significant risk for all German forces in the area.  The starving encircled forces at Stalingrad made no attempt to break out or link up with Manstein's advance. Some German officers requested that Paulus defy Hitler's orders to stand fast and instead attempt to break out of the Stalingrad pocket. Paulus refused, concerned about the Red Army attacks on the flank of Army Group Don and Army Group B in their advance on Rostov-on-Don, \"an early abandonment\" of Stalingrad \"would result in the destruction of Army Group A in the Caucasus,\" and the fact that his 6th Army tanks only had fuel for a 30&nbsp;km advance towards Hoth's spearhead, a futile effort if they did not receive assurance of resupply by air.

The Germans set up a \"mobile defence\" of small units that were to hold towns until supporting armour arrived. From the Soviet bridgehead at Mamon, 15 divisions \u2013 supported by at least 100 tanks \u2013 attacked the Italian Cosseria and [[3rd Infantry Division Ravenna|Ravenna]] Divisions, and although outnumbered 9 to 1, the Italians initially fought well, with the Germans praising the quality of the Italian defenders,<ref>''\"During this phase, the Germans praised the steadfastness of Italian infantry, who held out tenaciously even in isolated strong-points, but eventually reached their breaking-point under this constant pressure. \"'' The Unknown Eastern Front: The Wehrmacht and Hitler's Foreign Soldiers, Rolf-Dieter M\u00fcller, p. 83\u201384, I.B.Tauris, 28 February 2014</ref> but on 19 December, with the Italian lines disintegrating, ARMIR headquarters ordered the battered divisions to withdraw to new lines.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Paoletti|first=Ciro|title=A Military History of Italy|publisher=Praeger Security International|location=Westport, CT|year=2008|page=177| isbn=978-0-275-98505-9|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Uz8eiwzEMHQC&pg=PA182&dq=Ariete+tanks+fight!#PPA177,M1|accessdate=4 December 2009}}</ref>\n\nThe fighting forced a total revaluation of the German situation. Sensing that this was the last chance for a breakout, Manstein pleaded with Hitler on 18 December, but Hitler refused. Paulus himself also doubted the feasibility of such a breakout. The attempt to break through to Stalingrad was abandoned and Army Group A was ordered to pull back from the Caucasus. The 6th Army now was beyond all hope of German relief. While a motorised breakout might have been possible in the first few weeks, the 6th Army now had insufficient fuel and the German soldiers would have faced great difficulty breaking through the Soviet lines on foot in harsh winter conditions.

Nevertheless, they continued to resist, in part because they believed the Soviets would execute any who surrendered. In particular, the so-called ''HiWis'', Soviet citizens fighting for the Germans, had no illusions about their fate if captured. The Soviets were initially surprised by the number of Germans they had trapped, and had to reinforce their encircling troops. Bloody urban warfare began again in Stalingrad, but this time it was the Germans who were pushed back to the banks of the Volga. The Germans adopted a simple defence of fixing wire nets over all windows to protect themselves from grenades. The Soviets responded by fixing fish hooks to the grenades so they stuck to the nets when thrown. The Germans had no usable tanks in the city, and those that still functioned could, at best, be used as makeshift pillboxes. The Soviets did not bother employing tanks in areas where the urban destruction restricted their mobility.\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-F0316-0204-005, Russland, Paulus in Kriegsgefangenschaft.jpg|thumb|upright|left|''Generalfeldmarschall'' [[Friedrich Paulus]] (left), with his chief of staff, ''Generalleutnant'' [[Arthur Schmidt (soldier)|Arthur Schmidt]] (centre) and his aide, [[Wilhelm Adam (politician)|Wilhelm Adam]] (right), after their surrender]]\n\nOn 22 January, Paulus requested that he be granted permission to surrender.

Brown University historian [[Omer Bartov]] claims they were motivated by National Socialism. He studied 11,237 letters sent by soldiers inside of Stalingrad between 20 December 1942 and 16 January 1943 to their families in Germany.

British war correspondent [[Alexander Werth]] described the following scene in his ''Russia at War'' book, based on a first-hand account of his visit to Stalingrad on 3\u20135 February 1943,\n\n{{quote|We [...] went into the yard of the large burnt out building of the Red Army House; and here one realised particularly clearly what the last days of Stalingrad had been to so many of the Germans. In the porch lay the skeleton of a horse, with only a few scraps of meat still clinging to its ribs. Then we came into the yard. Here lay more {{sic|?|more}} horses' skeletons, and to the right, there was an enormous horrible [[cesspool]] \u2013 fortunately, frozen solid. And then, suddenly, at the far end of the yard I caught sight of a human figure. He had been crouching over another cesspool, and now, noticing us, he was hastily pulling up his pants, and then he slunk away into the door of the basement. But as he passed, I caught a glimpse of the wretch's face \u2013 with its mixture of suffering and idiot-like incomprehension. For a moment, I wished that the whole of Germany were there to see it. The man was probably already dying. In that basement [...] there were still two hundred Germans\u2014dying of hunger and frostbite. \"We haven't had time to deal with them yet,\" one of the Russians said. \"They'll be taken away tomorrow, I suppose.\" And, at the far end of the yard, besides the other cesspool, behind a low stone wall, the yellow corpses of skinny Germans were piled up \u2013 men who had died in that basement\u2014about a dozen wax-like dummies. We did not go into the basement itself \u2013 what was the use? There was nothing we could do for them.<ref>Alexander Werth, Russia at War 1941\u20131945, New York, E. P.

Writing in his diary on 1 January 1943, British General [[Alan Brooke]], [[Chief of the Imperial General Staff]], reflected on the change in the position from a year before:\n\n{{quote|I felt Russia could never hold, Caucasus was bound to be penetrated, and [[Abadan]] (our Achilles heel) would be captured with the consequent collapse of [[Mediterranean and Middle East theatre of World War II|Middle East]], [[South-East Asian theatre of World War II|India]], etc. After Russia's defeat how were we to handle the German land and air forces liberated? England would be again bombarded, threat of invasion revived... And now! We start 1943 under conditions I would never have dared to hope. Russia has held, Egypt for the present is safe. There is a hope of clearing North Africa of Germans in the near future... Russia is scoring wonderful successes in Southern Russia.<ref name=\"P.M.H.

However, there were only about 50,000 German soldiers at El Alamein in Egypt, while at Stalingrad 300,000 to 400,000 Germans had been lost.<ref name=\"P.M.H. Bell, 2011, p 107\"/>\n\nRegardless of the strategic implications, there is little doubt about Stalingrad's symbolism. Germany's defeat shattered its reputation for invincibility and dealt a devastating blow to German morale. On 30 January 1943, the tenth anniversary of his coming to power, Hitler chose not to speak. Joseph Goebbels read the text of his speech for him on the radio. The speech contained an oblique reference to the battle, which suggested that Germany was now in a defensive war. The public mood was sullen, depressed, fearful, and war-weary. Germany was looking in the face of defeat.<ref>P.M.H. Bell, ''Twelve Turning Points of the Second World War'', Yale University Press, New Haven and London, 2011, pp. 104\u201305, 107.</ref>\n\nThe reverse was the case on the Soviet side. There was an overwhelming surge in confidence and belief in victory. A common saying was: \"You cannot stop an army which has done Stalingrad.\" Stalin was feted as the hero of the hour and made a Marshal of the Soviet Union.<ref name=\"P.M.H.

The attack was supported by intense ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' bombing that reduced much of the city to rubble. The fighting degenerated into [[Urban warfare|house-to-house]] fighting; both sides poured reinforcements into the city. By mid-November 1942, the Germans had pushed the Soviet defenders back at great cost into narrow zones along the west bank of the [[Volga River]].\n\nOn 19 November 1942, the [[Red Army]] launched [[Operation Uranus]], a two-pronged attack targeting the weaker [[Kingdom of Romania|Romanian]] and [[Kingdom of Hungary (1920-1946)|Hungarian]] armies protecting the German 6th Army's flanks.<ref>Beevor (1998: 239)</ref> The Axis forces on the flanks were overrun and the 6th Army was [[encirclement|cut off and surrounded]] in the Stalingrad area.

There were a number of [[Salient (territory)|salients]], but these were not particularly threatening. Hitler was confident that he could master the [[Red Army]] after the winter of 1942, because even though [[Army Group Centre]] (''Heeresgruppe Mitte'') had suffered heavy losses west of [[Moscow]] the previous winter, 65% of its infantry had not been engaged and had been rested and re-equipped.

The initial objectives in the region around Stalingrad were the destruction of the industrial capacity of the city and the deployment of forces to block the [[Volga River]]. The river was a key route from the [[Caucasus]] and the [[Caspian Sea]] to central Russia. Its capture would disrupt commercial river traffic. The Germans cut the pipeline from the oilfields when they captured Rostov on 23 July. The capture of Stalingrad would make the delivery of [[Lend Lease]] supplies via the [[Persian Corridor]] much more difficult.<ref name=Shirer1990/>{{Rp|909|date=June 2011}}<ref>P.M.H.

Both sides began to attach propaganda value to the city, based on it bearing the name of the leader of the Soviet Union.

The German offensive started well. Soviet forces offered little resistance in the vast empty steppes and started streaming eastward. Several attempts to re-establish a defensive line failed when German units [[flanking maneuver|outflanked]] them. Two major pockets were formed and destroyed: the first, northeast of Kharkov, on 2 July, and a second, around [[Millerovo]], [[Rostov Oblast]], a week later. Meanwhile, the [[Second Army (Hungary)|Hungarian 2nd Army]] and the German 4th Panzer Army had launched an [[Battle of Voronezh (1942)|assault on Voronezh]], capturing the city on 5 July.\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 169-0952, Russland, bei Stalingrad, Offiziersbesprechung.jpg|thumb|Situation briefing near Stalingrad between a German company commander and a platoon leader]]\n\nThe initial advance of the 6th Army was so successful that Hitler intervened and ordered the 4th Panzer Army to join Army Group South (A) to the south. A massive [[traffic jam]] resulted when the 4th Panzer and the 1st Panzer both required the few roads in the area. Both armies were stopped dead while they attempted to clear the resulting mess of thousands of vehicles. The delay was long, and it is thought that it cost the advance at least one week. With the advance now slowed, Hitler changed his mind and reassigned the 4th Panzer Army back to the attack on Stalingrad.\n\nBy the end of July, the Germans had pushed the Soviets across the [[Don River, Russia|Don River]]. At this point, the Don and Volga Rivers are only {{convert|65|km|mi|abbr=on}} apart, and the Germans left their main supply depots west of the Don, which had important implications later in the course of the battle.

Beginning in late August, continuing in September and into October, the Soviets committed between two and four armies in hastily coordinated and poorly controlled attacks against the Germans' northern flank. The actions resulted in more than 200,000 Soviet Army casualties but did slow the German assault.\n\nOn 23 August the 6th Army reached the outskirts of Stalingrad in pursuit of the 62nd and 64th Armies, which had fallen back into the city.

These operations opened the Winter Campaign of 1942\u20131943 (19 November 1942 \u2013 3 March 1943), which involved some fifteen Armies operating on several fronts.

The Hungarian 2nd Army was given the task of defending a {{convert|200|km|mi|abbr=on}} section of the front north of Stalingrad between the Italian Army and [[Voronezh]]. This resulted in a very thin line, with some sectors where {{convert|1|\u2013|2|km|mi|abbr=on}} stretches were being defended by a single platoon. These forces were also lacking in effective anti-tank weapons.

The Soviet forces were allowed to retain bridgeheads on the right bank from which offensive operations could be quickly launched. These bridgeheads in retrospect presented a serious threat to Army Group B.<ref name=Shirer1990/>{{Rp|915|date=June 2011}}\n\nSimilarly, on the southern flank of the Stalingrad sector the front southwest of [[Kotelnikovo]] was held only by the Romanian 4th Army.

The northern flank was defended by Hungarian and Romanian units, often in open positions on the steppes. The natural line of defence, the Don River, had never been properly established by the German side. The armies in the area were also poorly equipped in terms of anti-tank weapons. The plan was to punch through the overstretched and weakly defended German flanks and surround the German forces in the Stalingrad region.\n\nDuring the preparations for the attack, [[Marshal of the Soviet Union|Marshal]] Zhukov personally visited the front and noticing the poor organisation, insisted on a one-week delay in the start date of the planned attack.<ref name=\"Beevor1998\"/>{{Rp|117|date=May 2009}} The operation was code-named \"Uranus\" and launched in conjunction with [[Operation Mars]], which was directed at [[Army Group Center]].

The attacking Soviet units under the command of Gen.

The preparations for the attack could be heard by the Romanians, who continued to push for reinforcements, only to be refused again. Thinly spread, deployed in exposed positions, outnumbered and poorly equipped, the [[Romanian Third Army|Romanian 3rd Army]], which held the northern flank of the German 6th Army, was overrun.\n\nBehind the front lines, no preparations had been made to defend key points in the rear such as [[Kalach-na-Donu|Kalach]]. The response by the ''Wehrmacht'' was both chaotic and indecisive. Poor weather prevented effective air action against the Soviet offensive.  Army Group B was in disarray and faced strong Soviet pressure across all its fronts.  Hence it was ineffective in relieving the 6th army.\n\nOn 20 November, a second Soviet offensive (two armies) was launched to the south of Stalingrad against points held by the Romanian [[4th Army Corps (Romania)|4th Army Corps]].

Not all of the 6th Army was trapped: 50,000 soldiers were brushed aside outside the pocket. These belonged mostly to the other two divisions of the 6th Army between the Italian and Romanian Armies: the 62nd and 298th Infantry Divisions. Of the 210,000 Germans, 10,000 remained to fight on, 105,000 surrendered, 35,000 left by air and the remaining 60,000 died.\n\nEven with the desperate situation of the Sixth Army, Army Group A continued their invasion of the Caucasus further south from 19 November until 19 December. By 19 December the German army was in full retreat out of the Caucasus, while using the Sixth Army to tie down the Soviet forces. Hence Army Group A was never used to help relieve the Sixth Army.\n\n[[Army Group Don]] was formed under Field Marshal von Manstein.

When asked by Hitler, G\u00f6ring replied, after being convinced by [[Hans Jeschonnek]],<ref name=hayward98/>{{Rp|234|date=May 2009}} that the ''Luftwaffe'' could supply the 6th Army with an \"[[airbridge (logistics)|air bridge]].\" This would allow the Germans in the city to fight on temporarily while a relief force was assembled.<ref name=Shirer1990/>{{Rp|926|date=June 2011}} A similar plan had been used a year earlier at the [[Demyansk Pocket]], albeit on a much smaller scale: a corps at Demyansk rather than an entire army.<ref name=Adam/>{{rp|132}}\n\n[[File:Ju 52 approaching Stalingrad late 1942.jpg|thumb|A Ju 52 approaching Stalingrad]]\n\nThe director of ''Luftflotte'' 4, Wolfram von Richthofen, tried to get this decision overturned. The forces under the 6th Army were almost twice as large as a regular German army unit, plus there was also a corps of the 4th Panzer Army trapped in the pocket. The maximum 107 tonnes they could deliver a day \u2013 based on the number of available aircraft and with only the airfield at [[Pitomnik Airfield|Pitomnik]] to land at \u2013 was far less than the minimum 750 tonnes needed.<ref name=hayward98/><ref group=\"Note\">Shirer p. 926 says that \"Paulus radioed that they would need a minimum of 750 tons of supplies day flown in,\" while Craig pp. 206\u201307 quotes Zeitzler as pressing Goering about his boast that the Luftwaffe could airlift the needed supplies: \"Are you aware&nbsp;... how many daily sorties the army in Stalingrad will need?&nbsp;... Seven hundred tons!

General Richthofen informed Manstein on 27 November of the small transport capacity of the Luftwaffe and the impossibility of supplying 300 tons a day by air. Manstein now saw the enormous technical difficulties of a supply by air of these dimensions. The next day he made a six-page situation report to the general staff. Based on the information of the expert Richthofen, he declared that contrary to the example of the pocket of Demyansk the permanent supply by air would be impossible. If only a narrow link could be established to Sixth Army, he proposed that this should be used to pull it out from the encirclement, and said that the Luftwaffe should instead of supplies deliver only enough ammunition and fuel for a breakout attempt. He acknowledged the heavy moral sacrifice that giving up Stalingrad would mean, but this would be made easier to bear by conserving the combat power of the Sixth Army and regaining the initiative.<ref>Kehrig, Manfred ''Stalingrad'', Stuttgart: Deutsche Verlags Anstalt, 1974 pp. 279, 311\u201312, 575.</ref> He ignored the limited mobility of the army and the difficulties of disengaging the Soviets. Hitler reiterated that the Sixth Army would stay at Stalingrad and that the air bridge would supply it until the encirclement was broken by a new German offensive.\n\nSupplying the 270,000 men trapped in the \"cauldron\" required 700 tons of supplies a day. That would mean 350 [[Ju 52]] flights a day into Pitomnik. At a minimum, 500 tons were required. However, according to Adam, \"On not one single day have the minimal essential number of tons of supplies been flown in.\"<ref name=Adam/>{{rp|119, 127, 131, 134}} The ''Luftwaffe'' was able to deliver an average of 85 tonnes of supplies per day out of an air transport capacity of 106 tonnes per day. The most successful day, 19 December, the ''Luftwaffe'' delivered 262 tonnes of supplies in 154 flights. The outcome of the airlift was the Luftwaffe's failure to provide its transport units with the tools they needed to maintain an adequate count of operational aircraft \u2013 tools that included airfield facilities, supplies, manpower, and even aircraft suited to the prevailing conditions.

The 6th Army slowly starved. General [[Kurt Zeitzler|Zeitzler]], moved by their plight, began to limit himself to their slim rations at meal times.

Operation Winter Storm (''Operation Wintergewitter''), the German attempt led by Erich von Manstein to relieve the trapped army from the south, was initially successful. By 18 December, the German Army had pushed to within 48&nbsp;km (30&nbsp;mi) of Sixth Army's positions. However the predictable nature of the relief operation brought significant risk for all German forces in the area.  The starving encircled forces at Stalingrad made no attempt to break out or link up with Manstein's advance. Some German officers requested that Paulus defy Hitler's orders to stand fast and instead attempt to break out of the Stalingrad pocket. Paulus refused, concerned about the Red Army attacks on the flank of Army Group Don and Army Group B in their advance on Rostov-on-Don, \"an early abandonment\" of Stalingrad \"would result in the destruction of Army Group A in the Caucasus,\" and the fact that his 6th Army tanks only had fuel for a 30&nbsp;km advance towards Hoth's spearhead, a futile effort if they did not receive assurance of resupply by air.

The Germans set up a \"mobile defence\" of small units that were to hold towns until supporting armour arrived. From the Soviet bridgehead at Mamon, 15 divisions \u2013 supported by at least 100 tanks \u2013 attacked the Italian Cosseria and [[3rd Infantry Division Ravenna|Ravenna]] Divisions, and although outnumbered 9 to 1, the Italians initially fought well, with the Germans praising the quality of the Italian defenders,<ref>''\"During this phase, the Germans praised the steadfastness of Italian infantry, who held out tenaciously even in isolated strong-points, but eventually reached their breaking-point under this constant pressure. \"'' The Unknown Eastern Front: The Wehrmacht and Hitler's Foreign Soldiers, Rolf-Dieter M\u00fcller, p. 83\u201384, I.B.Tauris, 28 February 2014</ref> but on 19 December, with the Italian lines disintegrating, ARMIR headquarters ordered the battered divisions to withdraw to new lines.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Paoletti|first=Ciro|title=A Military History of Italy|publisher=Praeger Security International|location=Westport, CT|year=2008|page=177| isbn=978-0-275-98505-9|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Uz8eiwzEMHQC&pg=PA182&dq=Ariete+tanks+fight!#PPA177,M1|accessdate=4 December 2009}}</ref>\n\nThe fighting forced a total revaluation of the German situation. Sensing that this was the last chance for a breakout, Manstein pleaded with Hitler on 18 December, but Hitler refused. Paulus himself also doubted the feasibility of such a breakout. The attempt to break through to Stalingrad was abandoned and Army Group A was ordered to pull back from the Caucasus. The 6th Army now was beyond all hope of German relief. While a motorised breakout might have been possible in the first few weeks, the 6th Army now had insufficient fuel and the German soldiers would have faced great difficulty breaking through the Soviet lines on foot in harsh winter conditions.

Nevertheless, they continued to resist, in part because they believed the Soviets would execute any who surrendered. In particular, the so-called ''HiWis'', Soviet citizens fighting for the Germans, had no illusions about their fate if captured. The Soviets were initially surprised by the number of Germans they had trapped, and had to reinforce their encircling troops. Bloody urban warfare began again in Stalingrad, but this time it was the Germans who were pushed back to the banks of the Volga. The Germans adopted a simple defence of fixing wire nets over all windows to protect themselves from grenades. The Soviets responded by fixing fish hooks to the grenades so they stuck to the nets when thrown. The Germans had no usable tanks in the city, and those that still functioned could, at best, be used as makeshift pillboxes. The Soviets did not bother employing tanks in areas where the urban destruction restricted their mobility.\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-F0316-0204-005, Russland, Paulus in Kriegsgefangenschaft.jpg|thumb|upright|left|''Generalfeldmarschall'' [[Friedrich Paulus]] (left), with his chief of staff, ''Generalleutnant'' [[Arthur Schmidt (soldier)|Arthur Schmidt]] (centre) and his aide, [[Wilhelm Adam (politician)|Wilhelm Adam]] (right), after their surrender]]\n\nOn 22 January, Paulus requested that he be granted permission to surrender. Hitler rejected it on a point of honour. He telegraphed the 6th Army later that day, claiming that it had made a historic contribution to the greatest struggle in German history and that it should stand fast \"to the last soldier and the last bullet.\" Hitler told Goebbels that the plight of the 6th Army was a \"heroic drama of German history.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Kershaw|2000|p=549}}</ref> On 24 January, in his radio report to Hitler, Paulus reported \"18,000 wounded without the slightest aid of bandages and medicines.\"<ref name=Adam/>{{rp|193}}\n\nOn 26 January 1943, the German forces inside Stalingrad were split into two pockets north and south of Mamai-Kurgan.

Brown University historian [[Omer Bartov]] claims they were motivated by National Socialism. He studied 11,237 letters sent by soldiers inside of Stalingrad between 20 December 1942 and 16 January 1943 to their families in Germany. Almost every letter expressed belief in Germany's ultimate victory and their willingness to fight and die at Stalingrad to achieve that victory.<ref name=Bartov>Bartov, Omer ''Hitler's Army'' Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1991 pp.&nbsp;166\u201367</ref> Bartov reported that a great many of the soldiers were well aware that they would not be able to escape from Stalingrad but in their letters to their families boasted that they were proud to \"sacrifice themselves for the F\u00fchrer\".<ref name=Bartov/>\n\nThe remaining forces continued to resist, hiding in cellars and sewers but by early March 1943, the last small and isolated pockets of resistance had surrendered.

British war correspondent [[Alexander Werth]] described the following scene in his ''Russia at War'' book, based on a first-hand account of his visit to Stalingrad on 3\u20135 February 1943,\n\n{{quote|We [...] went into the yard of the large burnt out building of the Red Army House; and here one realised particularly clearly what the last days of Stalingrad had been to so many of the Germans. In the porch lay the skeleton of a horse, with only a few scraps of meat still clinging to its ribs. Then we came into the yard. Here lay more {{sic|?|more}} horses' skeletons, and to the right, there was an enormous horrible [[cesspool]] \u2013 fortunately, frozen solid. And then, suddenly, at the far end of the yard I caught sight of a human figure. He had been crouching over another cesspool, and now, noticing us, he was hastily pulling up his pants, and then he slunk away into the door of the basement. But as he passed, I caught a glimpse of the wretch's face \u2013 with its mixture of suffering and idiot-like incomprehension. For a moment, I wished that the whole of Germany were there to see it. The man was probably already dying. In that basement [...] there were still two hundred Germans\u2014dying of hunger and frostbite. \"We haven't had time to deal with them yet,\" one of the Russians said. \"They'll be taken away tomorrow, I suppose.\" And, at the far end of the yard, besides the other cesspool, behind a low stone wall, the yellow corpses of skinny Germans were piled up \u2013 men who had died in that basement\u2014about a dozen wax-like dummies. We did not go into the basement itself \u2013 what was the use? There was nothing we could do for them.<ref>Alexander Werth, Russia at War 1941\u20131945, New York, E. P.

Some 35,000 were eventually sent on transports, of which 17,000 did not survive. Most died of wounds, disease (particularly [[typhus]]), cold, overwork, mistreatment and malnutrition. Some were kept in the city to help rebuild it.\n\nA handful of senior officers were taken to Moscow and used for propaganda purposes, and some of them joined the [[National Committee for a Free Germany]].

Bell, ''Twelve Turning Points of the Second World War'', Yale University Press, New Haven and London, 2011, p. 107.</ref> At the time, the global significance of the battle was not in doubt. Writing in his diary on 1 January 1943, British General [[Alan Brooke]], [[Chief of the Imperial General Staff]], reflected on the change in the position from a year before:\n\n{{quote|I felt Russia could never hold, Caucasus was bound to be penetrated, and [[Abadan]] (our Achilles heel) would be captured with the consequent collapse of [[Mediterranean and Middle East theatre of World War II|Middle East]], [[South-East Asian theatre of World War II|India]], etc. After Russia's defeat how were we to handle the German land and air forces liberated? England would be again bombarded, threat of invasion revived... And now! We start 1943 under conditions I would never have dared to hope. Russia has held, Egypt for the present is safe. There is a hope of clearing North Africa of Germans in the near future... Russia is scoring wonderful successes in Southern Russia.<ref name=\"P.M.H. Bell, 2011, p 107\"/>}}\n\nAt this point, the British had won the [[Second Battle of El Alamein|Battle of El Alamein]] in November 1942. However, there were only about 50,000 German soldiers at El Alamein in Egypt, while at Stalingrad 300,000 to 400,000 Germans had been lost.<ref name=\"P.M.H. Bell, 2011, p 107\"/>\n\nRegardless of the strategic implications, there is little doubt about Stalingrad's symbolism. Germany's defeat shattered its reputation for invincibility and dealt a devastating blow to German morale. On 30 January 1943, the tenth anniversary of his coming to power, Hitler chose not to speak. Joseph Goebbels read the text of his speech for him on the radio. The speech contained an oblique reference to the battle, which suggested that Germany was now in a defensive war. The public mood was sullen, depressed, fearful, and war-weary. Germany was looking in the face of defeat.<ref>P.M.H. Bell, ''Twelve Turning Points of the Second World War'', Yale University Press, New Haven and London, 2011, pp. 104\u201305, 107.</ref>\n\nThe reverse was the case on the Soviet side. There was an overwhelming surge in confidence and belief in victory. A common saying was: \"You cannot stop an army which has done Stalingrad.\" Stalin was feted as the hero of the hour and made a Marshal of the Soviet Union.<ref name=\"P.M.H.

{"title_page": "Jewish views on slavery", "text_new": "{{slavery}}\n\n'''Jewish views on slavery''' are varied both religiously (hello my name is samantha)and historically. [[Judaism]]'s  ancient and medieval religious texts contain numerous laws governing the ownership and treatment of slaves. Texts that contain such regulations include the [[Tanakh]] (Hebrew Bible), the [[Talmud]], the 12th-century [[Mishneh Torah]] by rabbi [[Maimonides]], and the 16th-century [[Shulchan Aruch]] by rabbi [[Yosef Karo]].  The original Israelite slavery laws found in the Hebrew Bible bear some resemblance to the 18th-century BCE slavery laws of [[Hammurabi]].<ref name=\"Hastings, p 619\">Hastings, p 619</ref>{{Obsolete source|date=July 2018}} The regulations changed over time.  The Hebrew Bible contained two sets of laws, one for [[Canaan]]ite slaves, and a more lenient set of laws for Hebrew slaves.  From the time of the Pentateuch, the laws designated for Canaanites were applied to all non-Hebrew slaves. The Talmud's slavery laws, which were established in the second through the fifth centuries CE,<ref name=\"BBC Religion\">{{cite web|title=The Talmud|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/judaism/texts/talmud.shtml|website=BBC Religion|publisher=BBC|accessdate=18 December 2014}}</ref> contain a single set of rules for all slaves, although there are a few exceptions where Hebrew slaves are treated differently from non-Hebrew slaves.  The laws include punishment for slave owners that mistreat their slaves.  In the modern era, when the [[abolitionism|abolitionist]] movement sought to outlaw slavery, supporters of slavery used the laws to provide religious justification for the practice of slavery.\n\nHistorically some Jewish people owned and traded slaves.<ref name=\"Reiss p 85\">{{cite book|author=Oscar Reiss|title=The Jews in Colonial America|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MQEyBgAAQBAJ&pg=PA85|date=2 January 2004|publisher=McFarland|isbn=978-0-7864-1730-8|page=85}}</ref> They participated in the [[Slavery in medieval Europe|medieval slave trade in Europe]] up to about the 12th century.<ref name=\"Hastings, p 620\"/>{{Obsolete source|date=July 2018}}<ref name=\"Drescher, p 107\"/><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.yivoencyclopedia.org/article.aspx/Trade|title=YIVO {{!}} Trade|website=www.yivoencyclopedia.org|language=en|access-date=2018-07-02}}</ref> Several scholarly works have been published to rebut the [[antisemitic canard]] of Jewish domination of the slave trade in Africa and the [[Americas]] in the later centuries,<ref>{{cite book|title=Jews and the American Slave Trade|author=Saul Friedman|pages=250\u2013254}}</ref><ref name=Finkelman>[https://www.jstor.org/stable/1051402 Reviewed Work: Jews, Slaves, and the Slave Trade: Setting the Record Straight by Eli Faber] by Paul Finkelman.

Failure to comply would result in excommunication.<ref>ibid</ref>\n\nIt is apparent that Jews still owned Jewish slaves in the Talmudic era because Talmudic authorities tried to denounce the practice<ref>Lev. 25:39</ref> that Jews could sell themselves into slavery if they were poverty-stricken.

The biblical seventh-year manumission was still to occur after the slave had been enslaved for six years; extra enslavement could not be tacked on to make up for the absence, unless the slave had been absent for more than a total of four years, and if the illness did not prevent light work (such as needlework), the slave could be ill for all six years without having to repay the time.</ref> Laws existed that specified punishment of owners that killed slaves.<ref>The vague (\"Avenger of Blood\", ''Jewish Encyclopedia'', 1901.) biblical instruction to ''avenge'' slaves that had died, from punishment by their masters, {{bibleverse||Exodus|21:20-21|}} became regarded as an instruction to view such events as murder, with masters guilty of such crime being [[Decapitation|beheaded]], see ''[[Mekhilta of Rabbi Ishmael|Mekhilta]]'', ''Mishpatim'' 7</ref><ref>On the other hand, the protection given to fugitive slaves was lessened by the classical rabbis; fugitive Israelite slaves were now compelled to buy their freedom, and if they were recaptured, then the time they had been absent was added on as extra before the usual 7th-year manumission could take effect.</ref> Jewish slaves were often treated as property; for example, they were not allowed to be counted towards the quorum, equal to 10 men, needed for public worship.<ref>''[[Berakhot (Talmud)|Berakot]]'' 47.

[[Judaism]]'s  ancient and medieval religious texts contain numerous laws governing the ownership and treatment of slaves. Texts that contain such regulations include the [[Tanakh]] (Hebrew Bible), the [[Talmud]], the 12th-century [[Mishneh Torah]] by rabbi [[Maimonides]], and the 16th-century [[Shulchan Aruch]] by rabbi [[Yosef Karo]].  The original Israelite slavery laws found in the Hebrew Bible bear some resemblance to the 18th-century BCE slavery laws of [[Hammurabi]].<ref name=\"Hastings, p 619\">Hastings, p 619</ref>{{Obsolete source|date=July 2018}} The regulations changed over time.  The Hebrew Bible contained two sets of laws, one for [[Canaan]]ite slaves, and a more lenient set of laws for Hebrew slaves.  From the time of the Pentateuch, the laws designated for Canaanites were applied to all non-Hebrew slaves. The Talmud's slavery laws, which were established in the second through the fifth centuries CE,<ref name=\"BBC Religion\">{{cite web|title=The Talmud|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/judaism/texts/talmud.shtml|website=BBC Religion|publisher=BBC|accessdate=18 December 2014}}</ref> contain a single set of rules for all slaves, although there are a few exceptions where Hebrew slaves are treated differently from non-Hebrew slaves.  The laws include punishment for slave owners that mistreat their slaves.  In the modern era, when the [[abolitionism|abolitionist]] movement sought to outlaw slavery, supporters of slavery used the laws to provide religious justification for the practice of slavery.\n\nHistorically some Jewish people owned and traded slaves.<ref name=\"Reiss p 85\">{{cite book|author=Oscar Reiss|title=The Jews in Colonial America|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MQEyBgAAQBAJ&pg=PA85|date=2 January 2004|publisher=McFarland|isbn=978-0-7864-1730-8|page=85}}</ref> They participated in the [[Slavery in medieval Europe|medieval slave trade in Europe]] up to about the 12th century.<ref name=\"Hastings, p 620\"/>{{Obsolete source|date=July 2018}}<ref name=\"Drescher, p 107\"/><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.yivoencyclopedia.org/article.aspx/Trade|title=YIVO {{!}} Trade|website=www.yivoencyclopedia.org|language=en|access-date=2018-07-02}}</ref> Several scholarly works have been published to rebut the [[antisemitic canard]] of Jewish domination of the slave trade in Africa and the [[Americas]] in the later centuries,<ref>{{cite book|title=Jews and the American Slave Trade|author=Saul Friedman|pages=250\u2013254}}</ref><ref name=Finkelman>[https://www.jstor.org/stable/1051402 Reviewed Work: Jews, Slaves, and the Slave Trade: Setting the Record Straight by Eli Faber] by Paul Finkelman.

Briefly outlined, the story recounts the experience of the [[Israelites]] under Egyptian enslavement, God's promise to redeem them from slavery, God's punishment of the Egyptians, and the Israelite redemption and departure from Egypt.  The Exodus story has been interpreted and reinterpreted in every era and in every location to suit or challenge cultural norms.<ref>Kushner, 332.</ref> The result over time has been a steady increase in governance of masters in favor of slaves' rights and eventually the complete prohibition of slavery.<ref name=\"Kushner457\" />\n\n==Biblical era==\nAncient Israelite society allowed slavery; however, total domination of one human being by another was not permitted.<ref name=\"Hezser, p 6\">Hezser, p 6</ref><ref>Potok, 457-459.</ref> Rather, slavery in antiquity among the Israelites was closer to what would later be called [[indentured servitude]].<ref name=\"Kushner457\">Kushner, 457.</ref> Slaves were seen as an essential part of a Hebrew household.<ref name=\"Hezser, p 382\">Hezser, p 382</ref> In fact, there were cases in which, from a slave's point of view, the stability of servitude under a family in which the slave was well-treated would have been preferable to economic freedom.<ref>Tigay, 153.</ref> It is impossible for scholars to quantify the number of slaves that were owned by Hebrews in ancient Israelite society, or what percentage of households owned slaves, but it is possible to analyze social, legal, and economic impacts of slavery.<ref>Hezser p 23</ref>\n\nThe [[Hebrew Bible]] contains two sets of rules governing slaves:  one set for Hebrew slaves (Lev 25:39-43) and a second set for [[Canaan]]ite slaves (Lev 25:45-46).<ref name=\"Hastings, p 619\"/>{{Obsolete source|date=July 2018}}<ref name=\"Hezser, p 29\">Hezser, p 29</ref> The main source of non-Hebrew slaves were prisoners of war.<ref name=\"Hezser, p 382\"/>   Hebrew slaves, in contrast to non-Hebrew slaves, became slaves either because of extreme poverty (in which case they could sell themselves to an Israelite owner) or because of inability to pay a debt.<ref name=\"Hezser, p 6\"/>  According to the Hebrew Bible, non-Hebrew slaves were drawn primarily from the neighboring [[Canaan]]ite nations,<ref name=\"Schorsch, p 63\">Schorsch, p 63</ref> and religious justification was provided for the enslavement of these neighbors:  the rules governing Canaanites was based on a curse aimed at [[Canaan (Biblical figure)|Canaan]], a son of [[Curse of Ham|Ham]],<ref>Lewis p 5</ref> but in later eras the Canaanite slavery laws were stretched to apply to all non-Hebrew slaves.<ref>Schorsch p 63</ref>\n\nThe laws governing non-Hebrew slaves were more harsh than those governing Hebrew slaves:  non-Hebrew slaves could be owned permanently, and bequeathed to the owner's children,<ref>Leviticus 25:45-45</ref> whereas Hebrew slaves were treated as servants, and were released after six years of service or the occurrence of a jubilee year.<ref>Hezser, p 30</ref><ref>Potok, 457</ref> One scholar suggests that the distinction was due to the fact that non-Hebrew slaves were subject to the [[curse of Canaan]], whereas God did not want Jews to be slaves because he freed them from [[The Exodus|Egyptian enslavement]].<ref>Hezser, pp 10, 30</ref>\n\nThe laws governing Hebrew slaves were more lenient than laws governing non-Hebrew slaves, but a single Hebrew word, ''ebed'' (meaning slave or servant, cognate to the Arabic ''[[Abd (Arabic)|abd]]'') is used for both situations.  In English translations of the Bible, the distinction is sometimes emphasized by translating the word as \"slave\" in the context of non-Hebrew slaves, and \"servant\" or \"bondman\" for Hebrew slaves.<ref name=\"Jewish Encyclopedia\">Jewish Encyclopedia</ref>\n\nMost slaves owned by Israelites were non-Hebrew, and scholars are not certain what percentage of slaves were Hebrew: [[Ephraim Urbach]], a distinguished scholar of Judaism,  maintains that Israelites rarely owned Hebrew slaves after the [[Maccabean]] era, although it is certain that Israelites owned Hebrew slaves during the time of the [[Babylonian exile]].<ref name=\"Hezser, p 6\"/>  Another scholar suggests that Israelites continued to own Hebrew slaves through the Middle Ages, but that the Biblical rules were ignored, and Hebrew slaves were treated the same as non-Hebrews.<ref>Schorsch, p. 63</ref>\n\nThe Torah forbids the return of runaway slaves who escape from their foreign land and their bondage and arrive in the Land of Israel. Furthermore, the Torah demands that such former slaves be treated equally to any other resident alien.<ref>Deuteronomy 23:16-17</ref> This law is unique in the Ancient Near East.<ref>Potok, 1124-1125</ref>\n\n==Talmudic era==\nIn the early [[Common Era]], the regulations concerning slave-ownership by Jews underwent an extensive expansion and codification within the Talmud.<ref name=\"Blackburn, p 68\">Blackburn, p 68</ref>  The precise issues that necessitated a clarification to the laws is still up for debate. The majority of current scholarly opinion holds that pressures to assimilate during the late Roman to early medieval period resulted in an attempt by Jewish communities to reinforce their own identities by drawing distinctions between their practices and the practices of non-Jews.<ref>Urbach, pp 3-4, 37-38</ref><ref>Milikowsky, Collected Writings in Jewish Studies</ref>  One author however, has forwarded that they could include factors such as ownership of non-Canaanite slaves, the continuing practice of owning Jewish slaves or conflicts with Roman slave-ownership laws.<ref name=\"Blackburn, p 68\"/> Thus, the [[Talmud]] (circa 200\u2013500 CE) contains an extensive set of laws governing slavery, which is more detailed than found in the [[Torah]].\n\nThe major change found in the Talmud's slavery laws was that a single set of rules, with a few exceptions, governs both Jewish slaves and non-Jewish slaves.<ref name=\"Schorsch, p 63\"/><ref name=\"Hezser, pp 8, 31-33, 39\">Hezser, pp 8, 31-33, 39</ref> Another change was that the distinction between Hebrew and non-Hebrew slaves began to diminish as the Talmud expanded during this period. This included an expanded set of obligations the owner incurred to the slave as well as codifying the process for manumission (the freeing from slavery). It also included a large set of conditions that allowed or required manumission to include requirements for education of slaves, expanding disability manumission, and in cases of religious conversion or necessity.<ref name=\"Hastings, p 620\">Hastings, p 620</ref><ref name=\"Schorsch, p 63\"/><ref name=\"Hezser, pp 8, 31-33, 39\"/>{{Obsolete source|date=July 2018}}<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Jewish Encyclopedia, \"Slaves and Slavery\"</ref><ref>Jewish Virtual Library, Slavery in Judaism</ref><ref>Kid 24a, Git 38b, Yev 93b</ref> These restrictions were based on the Biblical injunction to treat slaves well with the reinforcement of the memory of Egyptian slavery which Jews were urged to remember by their scriptural texts.<ref name=\"Goodman20072\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jdiKEOTphrgC|title=Rome and Jerusalem: The Clash of Ancient Civilizations|author=Martin Goodman|date=25 January 2007|publisher=Penguin Books Limited|isbn=978-0-14-190637-9|page=250}}</ref> However, historian [[Josephus]] wrote that the seven-year automatic release was still in effect if the slavery was a punishment for a crime the slave committed (as opposed to voluntary slavery due to poverty).<ref>Hezser, p 33</ref> In addition, the notion of Canaanite slaves from the Jewish Bible is expanded to all non-Jewish slaves.<ref>Schorsch, pp 64-65</ref>\n\nSignificant effort is given in the Talmud to address the property rights of slaves. While the Torah only refers to a slave's specific ability to collect gleanings, Talmudic sources interpret this commandment to include the right to own property more generally, and even \"purchase\" a portion of their own labor from the master. Hezser notes the often confusing mosaic of Talmudic laws distinguishes between finding property during work and earning property as a result of work.<ref>Hezser, p 46</ref><ref>Garnsey, \"Ideas of Slavery from Aristotle to Augustine\"</ref><ref>Schorsch</ref><ref>Kid 11b, Kid 14b (note 13), Ar. 1:2, Shek. 1:5, Pes. 8:2, 88b, Yev. 66a, Yev. 7:1, BK 11:1, BB 51b\u201352a, Sanh. 91a, 105a, Ket. 28a, Meg. 16a</ref> While the Talmud affirmed that self-redemption of slaves (Jewish or not) was always permitted, it noted that conditionless manumission by the owner was generally a violation of legal precept.<ref>Hastings, p 620, citing Gitten 45b</ref>{{Obsolete source|date=July 2018}}  The Talmud however, also included a varied list of circumstances and conditions that overrode this principle and mandated manumission. Conditions such as ill-treatment, oral promise, marriage to a free-woman, escape, inclusion in religious ceremony, and desire to visit the Holy Land all required the master to provide the slave with a deed of manumission, presented to him with witnesses. Failure to comply would result in excommunication.<ref>ibid</ref>\n\nIt is apparent that Jews still owned Jewish slaves in the Talmudic era because Talmudic authorities tried to denounce the practice<ref>Lev. 25:39</ref> that Jews could sell themselves into slavery if they were poverty-stricken. In particular, the Talmud said that Jews should not sell themselves to non-Jews, and if they did, the Jewish community was urged to ransom or redeem the slave.<ref name=\"Hastings, p 620\"/>{{Obsolete source|date=July 2018}}\n\nWhile Jews did take slaves for granted just as in other ancient societies, slaves in Jewish households could expect more compassionate treatment.<ref name=\"Goodman20072\"/>\n\n===Curse of Ham as a justification for slavery===\n{{See also|Curse of Ham#Early Jewish interpretations|The Bible and slavery}}\nSome scholars have asserted that the [[Curse of Ham]] described in Judaism's religious texts was a justification for slavery<ref>\n*{{cite book\n|title=History in Black: African-Americans in search of an ancient past\n|first=Jacob |last=Shavit\n|publisher=Routledge\n|year= 2001\n|isbn=0-7146-5062-5\n|pages=183\u2013185\n}}\n*{{cite book\n|title=The making of New World slavery: from the Baroque to the modern, 1492-1800\n|first=Robin |last=Blackburn\n|publisher=Verso\n|year= 1998\n|isbn=1-85984-195-3\n|page=89\n}}\n*{{cite book\n|title=Race: the history of an idea in the West\n|first=Ivan |last=Hannaford\n|publisher=Woodrow Wilson Center Press\n|year=1996\n}}\n*{{cite book\n|title=Noah's curse: the biblical justification of American slavery\n|first=Stephen R. \n|last=Haynes\n|publisher=Oxford University Press\n|year= 2002\n|pages=23\u201327, 65\u2013104\n}}\n*{{cite book\n|title=The Curse of Ham in the Early Modern Era: The Bible and the Justifications for Slavery\n|first=David M.\n|last=Whitford\n|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.\n|year=2009\n|pages=19\u201326}}\n*Washington, Joseph R.

The biblical seventh-year manumission was still to occur after the slave had been enslaved for six years; extra enslavement could not be tacked on to make up for the absence, unless the slave had been absent for more than a total of four years, and if the illness did not prevent light work (such as needlework), the slave could be ill for all six years without having to repay the time.</ref> Laws existed that specified punishment of owners that killed slaves.<ref>The vague (\"Avenger of Blood\", ''Jewish Encyclopedia'', 1901.) biblical instruction to ''avenge'' slaves that had died, from punishment by their masters, {{bibleverse||Exodus|21:20-21|}} became regarded as an instruction to view such events as murder, with masters guilty of such crime being [[Decapitation|beheaded]], see ''[[Mekhilta of Rabbi Ishmael|Mekhilta]]'', ''Mishpatim'' 7</ref><ref>On the other hand, the protection given to fugitive slaves was lessened by the classical rabbis; fugitive Israelite slaves were now compelled to buy their freedom, and if they were recaptured, then the time they had been absent was added on as extra before the usual 7th-year manumission could take effect.</ref> Jewish slaves were often treated as property; for example, they were not allowed to be counted towards the quorum, equal to 10 men, needed for public worship.<ref>''[[Berakhot (Talmud)|Berakot]]'' 47.

[The scholarship] had never been synthesized in a publication for non-scholarly audience.
