Manenti stars alongside [[Damien Bonnard]], Djebril Zonga, Issa Percia, Al-Hassan Ly, Steve Tientcheu, Almany Kanoute and Nizar Ben Fatma.\n\nThe film, set in the [[Communes of France|commune]] of [[Montfermeil]] in the aftermath of the [[2018 FIFA World Cup]], is based on a real-life occurrence of police violence which took place in the city on 14 October 2008, and was observed and filmed by Ly. The story follows several characters within the commune, as a theft from a teenager spirals into the threat of a large crisis. The film's title is a reference to the [[Victor Hugo]] 1982 novel [[Les Mis\u00e9rables|of the same name]], written in Montfermeil and partially set in it; in the novel, Montfermeil is also the setting of the meeting of [[Jean Valjean]] and [[Cosette]], a girl abused by her adoptive parents. The film depicts abuses against poor citizens, especially teenagers of African or Arabic ethnicities, thus stressing the continuity in the fate of the poor in Montfermeil.\n\nIt had its world premiere on 15 May 2015 at the [[Cannes Film Festival]], where it won the [[Jury Prize (Cannes Film Festival)|Jury Prize]]. It was released in France on 20 November 2019 and received critical acclaim, earning twelve nominations at the [[45th C\u00e9sar Awards|C\u00e9sar Awards]] and winning four including [[C\u00e9sar Award for Best Film|Best Film]]. Among other honors, it was selected as the [[List of French submissions for the Academy Award for Best International Feature Film|French entry]] for the [[Academy Award for Best International Feature Film|Best International Feature Film]] at the [[92nd Academy Awards]], eventually achieving the nomination.\n\n==Plot==\nThe film begins with images of the crowd in [[Paris]] celebrating the victory of the [[France national football team|French team]] at the [[2018 FIFA World Cup]] in the [[Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es|Avenue des Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es]], which had been perceived and celebrated in France as a moment of brotherhood between people of different social classes or ethnicities. \n\nSoon after, St\u00e9phane Ruiz, a Police officer who recently moved to Paris and joined the anti-crime brigade, is assigned to work with squad leader Chris and brigadier Gwada on duty in the nearby city of [[Montfermeil]]. Chris often aggressively abuses his power on teenagers, with Gwada complacent with that abuse; while he feels unease, St\u00e9phane doesn't interfere. Meanwhile, Issa, a known [[Juvenile delinquency|junevile delinquent]], steals Johnny, a lion cub, from a circus, causing its owner Zorro to go to the Mayor of Montfermeil and threaten to return with firearms if Johnny is not returned. Chris and his squadron are tasked with finding and retrieving the cub.\n\nOne of Issa's friends takes a picture of Issa with the cub and posts it on [[Instagram]], leading Chris to find out that Issa is the culprit. They chase, capture and handcuff him, but he claims that the cub run away. Issa's friends then attack the trio, throwing objects at them to stop them from taking Issa in. When Issa tries to run away, Gwada, having accidentally teargassed himself during the chase, shoots him in the face with a [[flash-ball]]. Issa's friends squander, but the squadron realize that they had been filmed by a drone, which escapes. While St\u00e9phane wants to take a badly wounded Issa to a hospital, Chris and Gwada refuse, and they instead the trio take him with them in their search of the drone's owner.\n\nThe trio arrive at a local neighborhood contact of Chris, leaving Issa in their care and using information given to them by said contact to find find Buzz, the teenager the drone belongs to, forcing him to flee before he can upload the video. Buzz, who still carries the drone's memory card, escapes the squadron and takes shelter with Salah, a restaurant owner and key member of the local [[Muslim world|Islamic community]]. Both the squadron and the mayor, having found out, arrive at Salah's restaurant. After a tense confrontation during which Chris attempts to illegally arrest Buzz, Ruiz convinces Salah to give him the memory card, claiming that Issa's shooting was just an accident.\n\nAfter recovering Issa and the cub (who happened to be spotted near them), the squardron takes the two to Zorro. Although they make Issa apologize, Zorro attempts to lock the two inside a cage with a fully grown lion, scaring Issa into wetting himself and almost making St\u00e9phane shoot the lion, although he eventually lets him go. Deciding that Issa has learned his lesson, Chris drops him off and warns him not to tell anyone what happened, and to say that he slipped and fell if asked about his injury. In the evening, the characters involved in that day's event seemingly return to their normal lives, some with visible signs of distress and doubt; Issa, who had been told earlier that his father did not want him back home because of his behavior,  sits alone on a ruined couch, traumatized. Later that night, Ruiz meets Gwada in a bar and tells him that he knows a flash-ball cannot be fired by accident, and that Gwada had therefore intentionally shot Issa. Gwada blames his stress and the children for overwhelming him, and St\u00e9phane, while unconvinced, leaves Gwada with the card, telling him to \"do what you gotta do.\"\n\nThe next day, the squadron, while on patrol, get attacked by a small group led by Issa. They chase them, falling into Issa's trap and ending up assaulted by a much larger group of teenager, leaving them trapped from all sides in a stairwell and fighting for their lives. Chris is wounded when a bottle breaks on his face, and the backup car St\u00e9phane radios for gets immediately destroyed by the teenagers, forcing the backup policemen to flee. They also attack the mayor's office and end up clubing him and throwing him down a set of stairs. St\u00e9phane pounds on the nearest door begging for help, which, incidentally, is the door to Buzz's apartment; however, Buzz further locks the door. Issa lights a molotov cocktail and prepares to finish the squadron off with it, leading St\u00e9phane to point his gun at him and warn him not to; the screen fades to black as both Issa and St\u00e9phane try to decide what to do next, and a quote from [[Victor Hugo]]' ''[[Les Mis\u00e9rables]]'' appear: \"Remember this, my friends: there are no such things as bad plants or bad men.
