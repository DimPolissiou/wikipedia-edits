Beach 4.jpg|thumb|Beaches are a common visit among residents and tourists alike in a Sydney summer ([[Bondi Beach]]).]] \nSummer in Sydney tends to vary, but it is generally warm to hot.<ref>{{cite book|last1=McDonald|first1=Josephine|title=Dreamtime superhighway an analysis of Sydney Basin rock art and prehistoric information exchange|date=2008|publisher=ANU E Press|location=Canberra, A.C.T.|isbn=9781921536175|page=11}}</ref> The western suburbs are [[microclimate|significantly hotter]] than the Sydney CBD by {{convert|2|-|5|C-change|0}} due to urban sprawl exacerbating the urban heat island effect and less exposure to mitigating sea breezes. In extreme occasions, the coast would have a temperature of {{convert|25|C|F}} with a [[sea breeze]], while a suburb {{Convert|30|km|abbr=on}} inland bakes in {{convert|38|C|F}} heat. At times, sea breezes do eventually reach the inland suburbs later in the day and would moderate the temperatures and raise humidity. Temperatures tend to be stable in late summer where they rarely go below {{convert|21|C|F}} or over {{convert|40|C|F}}, unlike late spring and early summer where such extremes would occur.<ref name=\"acnoh\"/> \n\nWhen temperatures reach over {{convert|30|C|F}}, the relative humidity seldom exceeds 45%, although low pressure troughs can increase humidity in some hot days, especially in late summer, where they may provide afternoon thunderstorms that are usually accompanied by heavy rainfall and, at times, [[hail]]. Furthermore, most mornings and nights would be muggy, with the 9am relative humidity ranging from 69% to 75%.<ref name=\"acnoh\"/><ref name=\"acnli\"/> The average 3pm [[dewpoint]] temperature in the [[summer]] ranges from {{convert|16.2|C}} at the coast, to {{convert|14.4|C}} inland. Dewpoints would be higher in late summer, reaching {{convert|20|C}}, especially in the mornings and evenings, although they would usually be lower in the heat of the day, dipping as low as {{convert|9|C}} in the extremely hot day.<ref>Torok, S. and Nicholls, N. 1996. A historical annual temperature dataset for Australia. Aust. Met. Mag., 45, 251\u201360.</ref>\n\nIn late spring and summer, Sydney can sometimes get northwesterly winds from the [[Outback]], which are dry and hot, making the temperatures soar above {{convert|38|C|0}}, with the [[relative humidity]] as low as 15%.

It is usually at this time of the year (autumn to early winter) where rainfall would be the highest.<ref>[http://www.smh.com.au/environment/weather/sydney-weather-fog-shrouds-city-before-the-sun-finally-emerges-20150504-ggu2mx.html Sydney weather: fog shrouds city before the sun finally emerges]</ref><ref>[http://www.smh.com.au/environment/weather/sydney-weather-planes-diverted-ferries-cancelled-as-city-blanketed-in-fog-20150710-gia0p3.html Sydney weather: Planes diverted, ferries cancelled as city blanketed in fog]</ref>\n\n<center>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! colspan=\"8\" |Wind direction in Sydney from 2002 to 2012 (average values) \n|-\n|North\n|Northeast\n|East\n|South East\n|Southern\n|Southwest\n|West\n|Northwest\n|-\n|5.9%\n|16.9%\n|14.1%\n|14.6%\n|24.9%\n|4.1%\n|11.9%\n|7.6%\n|-\n| colspan=\"8\" |  ''Source: [https://world-weather.info/archive/australia/sydney/ world-weather.info]''\n|}\n</center>\n\n===F\u00f6hn effect===\n[[File:Foehn wind illustration.svg|thumb|270px|F\u00f6hn wind illustration (''Left:'' Blue Mountains, ''Right:'' Sydney).]]\nSince Sydney borders the [[Blue Mountains (New South Wales)|Blue Mountains]] (part of the [[Great Dividing Range]]), it would experience a [[F\u00f6hn effect]], which is a dry wind originating from the Great Dividing Range that would abruptly raise the air temperature in the lee of that mountain range and reduce atmospheric moisture.<ref>Drechsel, S., Mayr, G.J. (2008) Objective forecasting of foehn winds for a subgrid-scale alpine valley. Weather and Forecasting, 23, 205-218. </ref> This dry wind, which elevates [[bushfires in Australia|fire danger]] in the warm months, occurs because of the partial [[orographic]] obstruction of comparatively damp low-level air and the subsiding of drier upper-level air in [[leeward]] of the mountains. As the moist air rises, it cools and it would condense, thereby creating precipitation on the upwind slopes. The precipitation then gets rid of the moisture from the air mass on the lee side, and the potential heat of [[condensation]] raises the temperature of the air there as well. The drier air is then heated more because of the [[adiabatic]] compression as it comes down the lee slopes.<ref>Sharples, J.J. Mills, G.A., McRae, R.H.D., Weber, R.O. (2010) ''Elevated fire danger conditions associated with foehn-like winds in southeastern Australia. Journal of Applied Meteorology and Climatology''.</ref> \n\nDuring this condition, an orographic cloud band, or the F\u00f6hn wall, builds up along the ridgelines of the NSW highlands due to condensation of moisture as the air ascends the windward slopes. Meanwhile, the F\u00f6hn arch, with its broad layer of [[altostratus]] cloud, shapes downwind of the mountains in the ascending component of a standing lee mountain wave. In [[weather map]]s, a band of clear air called the F\u00f6hn gap, which is over the downwind of the Blue Mountains region, can be seen between the wall and arched cloud cover \u2013 That is the region with dry gusty winds and raised temperatures, which may be cool to very warm, depending on the season. A similar effect are the [[Santa Ana winds]] observed in [[Southern California]].<ref>Sharples, J.J., McRae, R.H.D., Weber, R.O., Mills, G.A.

In summer, Sydney can go for long periods without rainfall. The other phenomenon that arises from these long, dry and hot periods is bushfires, which occur frequently in the areas surrounding the city. [[Water supply]] is a recurring concern for the city during drought periods. In 2005 the [[reservoir]]s reached an all-time low. However, water levels since then have recovered in 2013.\n\nMany areas of the city bordering bushland have experienced bushfires, notably in 1994 and [[Black Christmas bushfires|2001\u201302]] \u2014 these tend to occur during the spring and summer. Heatwaves, which are regularly occurring in recent years, would usually lead to [[Water restrictions in Australia|water restrictions]] and a high risk of [[Bushfires in Australia|bushfires]], which sometimes bring a smoky [[haze]] to the city.

In extreme occasions, the coast would have a temperature of {{convert|25|C|F}} with a [[sea breeze]], while a suburb {{Convert|30|km|abbr=on}} inland bakes in {{convert|38|C|F}} heat. At times, sea breezes do eventually reach the inland suburbs later in the day and would moderate the temperatures and raise humidity.

Furthermore, most mornings and nights would be muggy, with the 9am relative humidity ranging from 69% to 75%.<ref name=\"acnoh\"/><ref name=\"acnli\"/> The average 3pm [[dewpoint]] temperature in the [[summer]] ranges from {{convert|16.2|C}} at the coast, to {{convert|14.4|C}} inland.

(2008) Objective forecasting of foehn winds for a subgrid-scale alpine valley. Weather and Forecasting, 23, 205-218. </ref> This dry wind, which elevates [[bushfires in Australia|fire danger]] in the warm months, occurs because of the partial [[orographic]] obstruction of comparatively damp low-level air and the subsiding of drier upper-level air in [[leeward]] of the mountains. As the moist air rises, it cools and it would condense, thereby creating precipitation on the upwind slopes. The precipitation then gets rid of the moisture from the air mass on the lee side, and the potential heat of [[condensation]] raises the temperature of the air there as well. The drier air is then heated more because of the [[adiabatic]] compression as it comes down the lee slopes.<ref>Sharples, J.J. Mills, G.A., McRae, R.H.D., Weber, R.O.

Meanwhile, the F\u00f6hn arch, with its broad layer of [[altostratus]] cloud, shapes downwind of the mountains in the ascending component of a standing lee mountain wave. In [[weather map]]s, a band of clear air called the F\u00f6hn gap, which is over the downwind of the Blue Mountains region, can be seen between the wall and arched cloud cover \u2013 That is the region with dry gusty winds and raised temperatures, which may be cool to very warm, depending on the season.

However, water levels since then have recovered in 2013.\n\nMany areas of the city bordering bushland have experienced bushfires, notably in 1994 and [[Black Christmas bushfires|2001\u201302]] \u2014 these tend to occur during the spring and summer. Heatwaves, which are regularly occurring in recent years, would usually lead to [[Water restrictions in Australia|water restrictions]] and a high risk of [[Bushfires in Australia|bushfires]], which sometimes bring a smoky [[haze]] to the city. [[Smog]] is noticeable on hot days, even without bushfires.<ref>[http://goaustralia.about.com/cs/practicalinfo/a/sydneysummer.htm The Best Time to Visit Sydney - Summer]</ref><ref>{{cite web|publisher=Weather2Travel|date=2014|url=http://www.weather2travel.com/climate-guides/australia/new-south-wales/sydney.php|title=Sydney climate and weather averages|accessdate=5 October 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|publisher=Meteo365.com|date=2013|url=http://www.surf-forecast.com/breaks/Bondi-Beach/seatemp|title=Bondi Beach water temperature|accessdate=5 October 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe years 2009 and 2010 had dry conditions, according to Bureau of Meteorology.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/current/annual/nsw/archive/2009.sydney.shtml |title=Year 2009: Very warm with below average rainfall in Sydney |publisher=Bom.gov.au |date=4 January 2010 |accessdate=19 January 2014}}</ref> On 23 September 2009, a [[2009 Australian dust storm|dust storm]] that started in [[South Australia]] and inland [[New South Wales]] blanketed the city with reddish orange skies early in the morning.

The [[Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta]] creates different rivers that run mainly through the municipality of [[Santa Marta]], and that finally end up draining into the [[Caribbean Sea]].\n\nThe rivers that form part of this basin are:\n* Palomino River\n* Don Diego River 2\n* Buritaca River\n* Guachaca River\n* Mendiguaca River\n* Piedras River\n* Manzanares River\n* Gaira River\n\n;Sierra Nevada\u2019s Southwestern Slope\n\nThis basin gathers its waters from the rivers coming from the southern and western slopes of the Sierra Nevada. The basin irrigates great extensions of the municipalities of [[Ci\u00e9naga, Magdalena|Ci\u00e9naga]], [[Zona Bananera, Magdalena|Zona Bananera]], [[Fundaci\u00f3n]], [[Aracataca]], and [[El Ret\u00e9n]], which are the heart of the agricultural and livestock economy of the department.\nThe rivers that form part of this basin are:\n* Fr\u00edo River\n* Sevilla River\n* Tucurinca River\n* Aracataca River\n* Fundaci\u00f3n River\n* Rosa Creek\n\nIt also consists of a small number of [[Arroyo (creek)|arroyos]] that only flow during the rainy seasons.\n\nThis basin also encompasses the [[Ci\u00e9naga Grande de Santa Marta]], the largest [[marsh]] in the north of the country, which is formed by 16 smaller marshes that are connected by means of [[Arm (geography)|arms]] within the march. The balance of the march is a delicate one that depends on the fresh waters coming from the Sierra Nevada, and the periodical flooding of the [[Magdalena River]], and the salt water coming from the mouth of the March to the sea, that is carried by the current and winds into the marshland.\n\n;Magdalena Basin\n\n[[Image:El Banco.JPG|left|thumb|View of the municipality of [[El Banco]] from the [[Magdalena River]]]]\n\nThe Magdalena River Basin is the largest drainage basin in the department, it is formed by the [[Magdalena River]] and its [[tributary|tributaries]] that feed on to the river and the Marsh.\n\n[[Image:El muelle en la inundacion del 2005.JPG|thumb|Overflow of the Magdalena River caused floodings in 2005.]]\n\nThe [[Momp\u00f3x Depression]] is found within this basin, this depression runs from the [[Zapatosa Marsh]] to the delta of the Magdalena River. This depression collects the most water in the department as its where the [[Cauca River]], [[Cesar River]], and the [[San Jorge River]] drain its waters. The Magdalena River is by far the most affluent river of these, and during the rainy season when it overflows, it causes the other rivers to flow backwards, not before overflowing the marshes and sometimes flooding some valleys.\n\n;Ariguan\u00ed Basin\n\nThe [[Ariguan\u00ed River]] drains into the Magdalena River through the Zapatosa Marsh and washes over the central valleys of the departments of Magdalena and [[Cesar Department|Cesar]] that are the principal areas of agriculture and [[animal husbandry]] in the [[Caribbean Region of Colombia|Caribbean Region]].\n\n;Marshes\n\nThe department of Magdalena is characterized by its many marshes and extensive marshland valleys. The whole western side of the department its dotted with marshes and lakes due to the Magdalena River that borders the department on this side. Most of this marshes are located in the northwestern side. The permanent marshes are, Chilloa, La Rinconada, Tesca, Piji\u00f1o, Juan Criollo, Jaraba, Playa Afuera, [[Ci\u00e9naga Grande de Santa Marta]], and [[Zapatosa Marsh|Zapatosa]].\n[[Image:Cienaga Grande de Santa Marta.jpg|thumb|[[Ci\u00e9naga Grande de Santa Marta]]]]\n{{main|Ci\u00e9naga Grande de Santa Marta}}  \n\nThe Ci\u00e9naga Grande de Santa Marta, is the biggest and by far the most important marsh in the department of Magdalena and one of the most important marshes in the country. It is located in the northwest of the department and is separated from the sea by a very thin margin of land, only a few meters away. It has an extension of 4,280&nbsp;km\u00b2, of which 730&nbsp;km\u00b2 are just water mirrors with a depth of 2 to 6 meters.\n\nThe [[Zapatosa Marsh]], located in the municipality of [[El Plato]] in the southernmost part of the department, it is shared with the [[Cesar Department]], who controls most of its waters. It has an extension of 310&nbsp;km\u00b2 and at its deepest it reaches about 8m. In it many rivers of different importance merge. The Zapatosa Marsh drains into the Magdalena River by an arm of about 16&nbsp;km of length.\n\n===Climate===\nThe Department of Magdalena, because of its terrain, and proximity to the sea has an unstable weather. Its [[Climate]] is mainly dictated by its global positioning, and because the department of Magdalena is located on the [[Intertropical Convergence Zone]] it possess an inter-[[tropical climate]]. Temperature in the department is affected by [[ocean current]]s, [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] and [[atmospheric pressure]], it mainly has a hot temperatures with high humidity, but temperatures vary as altitude raises.\n\nThe altitude of the department goes from 0m to 5,775m above sea levels, the drastic changes of altitude divide the territory into what is called [[thermal floors]]. There are no solid or determined divides between these floors as local factors can affect the temperature. The first 200m of altitude are considered the warm lands, they occupy a great extension of the departmental territory, the average temperature is of 30 [[Celsius|\u00b0C]]. The main urban centers are located in the warm lands, including all of the downtown urban area of Santa Marta. The altitude increase because of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta, an isolated mountain, the highest at sea level, and temperatures raise as it goes up.\n\n===Winds===\n[[File:Foehn wind illustration.svg|thumb|Illustration of the F\u00f6hn effect]]\n\nThe presence of the Sierra Nevada in this area of the country has consequences in the climate of the department, the SNSM stands windward blocking the path of the [[Trade wind]]s that blow from the North and Northeast creating a greater cloud accumulation and precipitation. The winds that crash into the mountain ascend in an [[Orographic lift]], this cooler air cannot hold the moisture as well as warm air and this effectively raises the [[relative humidity]], creating clouds and frequently [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]]. The clouds that manage to pass over the mountain, move hastily downwards creating [[foehn wind]]s that raise the temperature of the area west of the Sierra, which include the Santa Marta, and Ci\u00e9naga.\n\nIn the coastal area, droughts are cause by the diversion of the cold and warm [[katabatic wind]]s coming down the Sierra, however the [[sea breeze]]s help to cool down temperatures a bit, but by because of their direction, they end up extending the drought effects farther inland.\n\n===Rainfall===\n\nThe department of Magdalena due to its location in the Intertropical Convergence Zone has only two seasons. The [[Wet season|Rainy season]] takes place between April and November, with a period of less intensity between June and August. The [[dry season]] takes place during December and March.\n\nThe [[Mompox Depression]] presents its own climatic conditions due to its many permanent bodies of water, like the different ci\u00e9nagas or mashes, and rivers and lakes. This wet habitat, permanently exposed to [[sunlight|solar radiation]], makes for a very [[humidity|humid]] environment, with an average annual rainfall of between 1,500 and 2,000mm, these rains are [[Precipitation types (meteorology)|Convection rain]]s as they are created by evaporation of its waters by high temperatures, this is typical precipitation around the equatorial belt.\n\nDue to its complicated geography, the precipitation in the department ranges from 250mm in the driest areas, to 4,000mm in the cold floors of the Sierra Nevada.\n\n===Environment===\n\n[[Image:StaMarta2 103.jpg|thumb|Kids playing in the beach in Santa Marta]]\n[[Image:Taganga.jpg|thumb|Taganga]]\nThe territory of Magdalena has an area of approximately 23,188&nbsp;km\u00b2, small compared to other regions, but in its territory various types of different [[ecoregion]]s are found.

[[Departments of Colombia|department]] of [[Colombia]], located to the north of the country by the [[Caribbean Sea]]. The capital of the Magdalena Department is [[Santa Marta]] and was named after the [[Magdalena River]]. It inherited the name of one of the original nine states of the [[United States of Colombia]] that its current territory integrated.\n\n==Geography==\n\n[[Image:Colombia.A2004117.1535.250m.jpg|thumb|Magdalena Department seen from space.]]\n{{Historical populations\n|type =\n|footnote = Source:<ref>{{cite web|title=Reloj de Poblaci\u00f3n|url=http://www.dane.gov.co/reloj/|website=DANE|publisher=Departamento Administrativo Nacional de Estad\u00edsitica|accessdate=6 July 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180116020433/http://www.dane.gov.co/reloj/|archive-date=January 16, 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n|1973 | 540258\n|1985 | 890934\n|1993 | 1127631\n|2005 | 1149917\n|2018 | 1341746\n}}\n===Location===\n\nThe Department of Magdalena is located on the North Coast of the Colombian [[Caribbean Region of Colombia|Caribbean Region]].\n\nOn the north it borders the [[Caribbean Sea]].\nOn the [[Cardinal direction|northeast]] it borders the [[La Guajira Department]], being divided by the Palomino River.\nOn the east it borders with the [[Cesar Department]], which is in part divided by the Guaran\u00ed River.\n\nOn the west, it is divided by the [[Magdalena River]], and it borders the departments of [[Atl\u00e1ntico Department|Atlantico]] in the [[Cardinal direction|Northwest]], and [[Bol\u00edvar Department|Bol\u00edvar]] in the West and Southwest.\n\n===Hydrology===\n\n====Basins====\nThe territory of the Department of Magdalena is formed by four [[drainage basin]]s which are very different in composition and importance.\n\n;Sierra Nevada's Northern Slope\n\nThe drainage basin of the Sierra Nevada's western slope is located in the northern part of the department. The [[Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta]] creates different rivers that run mainly through the municipality of [[Santa Marta]], and that finally end up draining into the [[Caribbean Sea]].\n\nThe rivers that form part of this basin are:\n* Palomino River\n* Don Diego River 2\n* Buritaca River\n* Guachaca River\n* Mendiguaca River\n* Piedras River\n* Manzanares River\n* Gaira River\n\n;Sierra Nevada\u2019s Southwestern Slope\n\nThis basin gathers its waters from the rivers coming from the southern and western slopes of the Sierra Nevada. The basin irrigates great extensions of the municipalities of [[Ci\u00e9naga, Magdalena|Ci\u00e9naga]], [[Zona Bananera, Magdalena|Zona Bananera]], [[Fundaci\u00f3n]], [[Aracataca]], and [[El Ret\u00e9n]], which are the heart of the agricultural and livestock economy of the department.\nThe rivers that form part of this basin are:\n* Fr\u00edo River\n* Sevilla River\n* Tucurinca River\n* Aracataca River\n* Fundaci\u00f3n River\n* Rosa Creek\n\nIt also consists of a small number of [[Arroyo (creek)|arroyos]] that only flow during the rainy seasons.\n\nThis basin also encompasses the [[Ci\u00e9naga Grande de Santa Marta]], the largest [[marsh]] in the north of the country, which is formed by 16 smaller marshes that are connected by means of [[Arm (geography)|arms]] within the march. The balance of the march is a delicate one that depends on the fresh waters coming from the Sierra Nevada, and the periodical flooding of the [[Magdalena River]], and the salt water coming from the mouth of the March to the sea, that is carried by the current and winds into the marshland.\n\n;Magdalena Basin\n\n[[Image:El Banco.JPG|left|thumb|View of the municipality of [[El Banco]] from the [[Magdalena River]]]]\n\nThe Magdalena River Basin is the largest drainage basin in the department, it is formed by the [[Magdalena River]] and its [[tributary|tributaries]] that feed on to the river and the Marsh.\n\n[[Image:El muelle en la inundacion del 2005.JPG|thumb|Overflow of the Magdalena River caused floodings in 2005.]]\n\nThe [[Momp\u00f3x Depression]] is found within this basin, this depression runs from the [[Zapatosa Marsh]] to the delta of the Magdalena River. This depression collects the most water in the department as its where the [[Cauca River]], [[Cesar River]], and the [[San Jorge River]] drain its waters. The Magdalena River is by far the most affluent river of these, and during the rainy season when it overflows, it causes the other rivers to flow backwards, not before overflowing the marshes and sometimes flooding some valleys.\n\n;Ariguan\u00ed Basin\n\nThe [[Ariguan\u00ed River]] drains into the Magdalena River through the Zapatosa Marsh and washes over the central valleys of the departments of Magdalena and [[Cesar Department|Cesar]] that are the principal areas of agriculture and [[animal husbandry]] in the [[Caribbean Region of Colombia|Caribbean Region]].\n\n;Marshes\n\nThe department of Magdalena is characterized by its many marshes and extensive marshland valleys. The whole western side of the department its dotted with marshes and lakes due to the Magdalena River that borders the department on this side. Most of this marshes are located in the northwestern side. The permanent marshes are, Chilloa, La Rinconada, Tesca, Piji\u00f1o, Juan Criollo, Jaraba, Playa Afuera, [[Ci\u00e9naga Grande de Santa Marta]], and [[Zapatosa Marsh|Zapatosa]].\n[[Image:Cienaga Grande de Santa Marta.jpg|thumb|[[Ci\u00e9naga Grande de Santa Marta]]]]\n{{main|Ci\u00e9naga Grande de Santa Marta}}  \n\nThe Ci\u00e9naga Grande de Santa Marta, is the biggest and by far the most important marsh in the department of Magdalena and one of the most important marshes in the country. It is located in the northwest of the department and is separated from the sea by a very thin margin of land, only a few meters away. It has an extension of 4,280&nbsp;km\u00b2, of which 730&nbsp;km\u00b2 are just water mirrors with a depth of 2 to 6 meters.\n\nThe [[Zapatosa Marsh]], located in the municipality of [[El Plato]] in the southernmost part of the department, it is shared with the [[Cesar Department]], who controls most of its waters. It has an extension of 310&nbsp;km\u00b2 and at its deepest it reaches about 8m. In it many rivers of different importance merge. The Zapatosa Marsh drains into the Magdalena River by an arm of about 16&nbsp;km of length.\n\n===Climate===\nThe Department of Magdalena, because of its terrain, and proximity to the sea has an unstable weather. Its [[Climate]] is mainly dictated by its global positioning, and because the department of Magdalena is located on the [[Intertropical Convergence Zone]] it possess an inter-[[tropical climate]]. Temperature in the department is affected by [[ocean current]]s, [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] and [[atmospheric pressure]], it mainly has a hot temperatures with high humidity, but temperatures vary as altitude raises.\n\nThe altitude of the department goes from 0m to 5,775m above sea levels, the drastic changes of altitude divide the territory into what is called [[thermal floors]]. There are no solid or determined divides between these floors as local factors can affect the temperature. The first 200m of altitude are considered the warm lands, they occupy a great extension of the departmental territory, the average temperature is of 30 [[Celsius|\u00b0C]]. The main urban centers are located in the warm lands, including all of the downtown urban area of Santa Marta. The altitude increase because of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta, an isolated mountain, the highest at sea level, and temperatures raise as it goes up.\n\n===Winds===\n[[File:Foehn wind ilustration.svg|thumb|Illustration of the F\u00f6hn effect]]\n\nThe presence of the Sierra Nevada in this area of the country has consequences in the climate of the department, the SNSM stands windward blocking the path of the [[Trade wind]]s that blow from the North and Northeast creating a greater cloud accumulation and precipitation. The winds that crash into the mountain ascend in an [[Orographic lift]], this cooler air cannot hold the moisture as well as warm air and this effectively raises the [[relative humidity]], creating clouds and frequently [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]]. The clouds that manage to pass over the mountain, move hastily downwards creating [[foehn wind]]s that raise the temperature of the area west of the Sierra, which include the Santa Marta, and Ci\u00e9naga.\n\nIn the coastal area, droughts are cause by the diversion of the cold and warm [[katabatic wind]]s coming down the Sierra, however the [[sea breeze]]s help to cool down temperatures a bit, but by because of their direction, they end up extending the drought effects farther inland.\n\n===Rainfall===\n\nThe department of Magdalena due to its location in the Intertropical Convergence Zone has only two seasons. The [[Wet season|Rainy season]] takes place between April and November, with a period of less intensity between June and August. The [[dry season]] takes place during December and March.\n\nThe [[Mompox Depression]] presents its own climatic conditions due to its many permanent bodies of water, like the different ci\u00e9nagas or mashes, and rivers and lakes. This wet habitat, permanently exposed to [[sunlight|solar radiation]], makes for a very [[humidity|humid]] environment, with an average annual rainfall of between 1,500 and 2,000mm, these rains are [[Precipitation types (meteorology)|Convection rain]]s as they are created by evaporation of its waters by high temperatures, this is typical precipitation around the equatorial belt.\n\nDue to its complicated geography, the precipitation in the department ranges from 250mm in the driest areas, to 4,000mm in the cold floors of the Sierra Nevada.\n\n===Environment===\n\n[[Image:StaMarta2 103.jpg|thumb|Kids playing in the beach in Santa Marta]]\n[[Image:Taganga.jpg|thumb|Taganga]]\nThe territory of Magdalena has an area of approximately 23,188&nbsp;km\u00b2, small compared to other regions, but in its territory various types of different [[ecoregion]]s are found. From the beaches and sea landscape in the North, the snow-covered peaks in the Sierra, the swampy marshes in the west, the [[cloud forest]]s, to the grasslands inland, the urban districts, the farmlands, the dry desert like, the deep rain forest, the rocky rivers to many other small ecosystems.

An exhaustive search of the files under Public Buildings and Grounds in the U.S. National Archives and of the several collections in the Library of Congress have proved fruitless.  A careful perusal of all known surviving correspondence and papers of Andrew Ellicott and of Pierre Charles L'Enfant has likewise failed to reveal mention of Banneker.  This conclusively dispels the legend that after L'Enfant's dismissal and his refusal to make available his plan of the city, Ellicott was able to reconstruct it in detail from Banneker's recollection. Equally untrue are legends that Thomas Jefferson as Secretary of State invited Banneker to luncheon at the White House.

The single notable exception is Silvio A. Bedini's ''The Life of Benjamin Banneker'' (New York, 1972), a work of painstaking research and scrupulous attention to accuracy which also benefits from the author's discovery of important and hitherto unavailable manuscript sources. However, as Bedini points out, the story of Banneker's involvement in the survey of the Federal District \"rests on extremely meager documentation\" (p. 104). This consists of a single mention by TJ, two brief statements by Banneker himself, and the newspaper allusion quoted above. In consequence, Bedini's otherwise reliable biography accepts the version of Banneker's role in this episode as presented in reminiscences of nineteenth-century authors. These recollections, deriving in large part from members of the Ellicott family, who were prompted by Quaker inclinations to justice and equality, have compounded the confusion. The nature of TJ's connection with Banneker is treated in the Editorial Note to the group of documents under 30 Aug. 1791, but because of the obscured record it is necessary here to attempt a clarification of the role of this modest, self-taught tobacco farmer in the laying out of the national capital.<br/>First of all, because of unwarranted claims to the contrary, it must be pointed out that there is no evidence whatever that Banneker had anything to do with the survey of the Federal City or indeed with the final establishment of the boundaries of the Federal District. All available testimony shows that he was present only during the few weeks early in 1791 when the rough preliminary survey of the ten mile square was made; that, after this was concluded and before the final survey was begun, he returned to his farm and his astronomical studies in April, accompanying Ellicott part way on his brief journey back to Philadelphia; and that thenceforth he had no connection with the mapping of the seat of government. ...<br/>In any case, Banneker's participation in the surveying of the Federal District was unquestionably brief and his role uncertain.}}<br>(4) {{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/opinions/1994/02/20/the-egyptian-illusion/ee123656-ca7f-4ef7-8f28-99d7edd166ba/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180918055745/https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/opinions/1994/02/20/the-egyptian-illusion/ee123656-ca7f-4ef7-8f28-99d7edd166ba/|archivedate=2018-09-18|url-status=live|title=The Egyptian Illusion|last=Martel|first=Erich|work=Opinions|publisher=[[The Washington Post]]|date=1994-02-20|accessdate=2018-09-17|quote=Teachers who want reliable information on African American history often don't know where to turn.

The single notable exception is Silvio A. Bedini's ''The Life of Benjamin Banneker'' (New York, 1972), a work of painstaking research and scrupulous attention to accuracy which also benefits from the author's discovery of important and hitherto unavailable manuscript sources. However, as Bedini points out, the story of Banneker's involvement in the survey of the Federal District \"rests on extremely meager documentation\" (p. 104). This consists of a single mention by TJ, two brief statements by Banneker himself, and the newspaper allusion quoted above. In consequence, Bedini's otherwise reliable biography accepts the version of Banneker's role in this episode as presented in reminiscences of nineteenth-century authors. These recollections, deriving in large part from members of the Ellicott family, who were prompted by Quaker inclinations to justice and equality, have compounded the confusion. The nature of TJ's connection with Banneker is treated in the Editorial Note to the group of documents under 30 Aug. 1791, but because of the obscured record it is necessary here to attempt a clarification of the role of this modest, self-taught tobacco farmer in the laying out of the national capital.<br>First of all, because of unwarranted claims to the contrary, it must be pointed out that there is no evidence whatever that Banneker had anything to do with the survey of the Federal City or indeed with the final establishment of the boundaries of the Federal District. All available testimony shows that he was present only during the few weeks early in 1791 when the rough preliminary survey of the ten mile square was made; that, after this was concluded and before the final survey was begun, he returned to his farm and his astronomical studies in April, accompanying Ellicott part way on his brief journey back to Philadelphia; and that thenceforth he had no connection with the mapping of the seat of government. ...<br/>In any case, Banneker's participation in the surveying of the Federal District was unquestionably brief and his role uncertain.}}</ref><ref>(1) [https://archive.org/stream/bulletinunitedst2311964unit#page/n8/mode/1up Bedini, 1964.]<br>(2) [http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/rchs_1969.pdf Bedini, 1969.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171007223056/http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/rchs_1969.pdf |date=October 7, 2017 }}<br>(3) [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00silv/page/n8/mode/1up Bedini, 1972.]<br>(4) Bedini, 1991.<br>(5) [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00bedi/page/n7/mode/1up Bedini,1999.]<br>(6) [https://web.archive.org/web/20160310095152/http://www.amazon.com/The-Life-Benjamin-Banneker-African-American/dp/0938420593#customerReviews Murdock]<br>(7) [https://web.archive.org/web/20140426233224/http://www.profsurv.com/magazine/article.aspx?i=567 Toscano, 2000.]<br>(8) [http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Benjamin_Banneker.aspx Bedini, 2008.]</ref>\n\nIn a 1969 publication, Bedini reported that a story connecting Banneker with the survey and planning of the federal city had appeared within a work that a member of the Ellicott family had edited.

Major Andrew Ellicott, one of the Ellicott boys, was named Chief Surveyor. At Jefferson's request, Banneker was appointed as the third member of the team.<br/>The assignment was to define the boundaries of the new city and then design and lay out its streets and major buildings. Banneker worked closely with L'Enfant and his maps. But the bureaucrats of that day did not take kindly to a foreigner being given so much power and authority and they interfered in many frustrating ways.  This resulted in the highly sensitive and hot-tempered L'Enfant resigning his position and returning to France, taking all of the plans and maps with him. Everyone was dismayed and Jefferson called a meeting of the men involved. What was to be done? Start all over again after more than a year's work? Dispair and frustration showed on their faces. Suddenly Banneker asked, \"Did you like the plans that were made?\" All eyes turned to him. \"Of course, but we don't have them.\" \"I think I can reproduce them from memory\", said Banneker. The men were astounded and somewhat skeptical. Banneker then went home, and because of his remarkable memory, was able to reproduce all the plans in two days. The work of laying out the city of Washington, with its streets and major buildings, was completed and stands today as a monument to Banneker's genius.}}\n*{{cite book |year=1970 |first=Claude |last=Lewis |url=https://archive.org/details/benjaminbanneker00lewi |url-access=registration |title=Chapter 9: Planning the Nation's Capital |work=Benjamin Banneker: The Man Who Saved Washington |location=New York |publisher=McGraw-Hill |pages=[https://archive.org/details/benjaminbanneker00lewi/page/79 79]\u201395 |oclc=72113 |lccn=79092101 |accessdate=2019-09-19 |quote=He probably does, Mr. Secretary.

Nor was he mentioned in any of the surviving correspondence and papers of Andre Ellicott and of Pierre Charles L'Enfant. .... Although the exact date of Banneker's departure from the survey is not specified in Ellicott's report of expenditures, it occurred sometime late in the month of April 1791, following the arrival of one of Ellicott's brothers. It was not until some ten months after Banneker's departure from the scene that L'Enfant was dismissed, by means of a letter from Jefferson dated February 27, 1792. This conclusively dispels any basis for the legend that after L'Enfant's dismissal and his refusal to make available his plan of the city, Banneker recollected the plan in detail from which Ellicott was able to reconstruct it. Equally untrue and in fact impossible is the legend that Thomas Jefferson as secretary of state invited Banneker to luncheon at the White House.

Writers have implied a wide range of involvement, from the keeper of horses or supervisor of the woodcutters, to the full responsibility of not only the survey of the ten mile square but the design of the city as well. None of these accounts has described the contribution which Banneker actually made.\"<br>(2) [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00silv/page/126/mode/1up Bedini, 1972, p. 126.] \"Benjamin Banneker's name does not appear on any of the contemporary documents or records relating to the selection, planning, and survey of the City of Washington.  An exhaustive search of the files under Public Buildings and Grounds in the U.S. National Archives and of the several collections in the Library of Congress have proved fruitless.  A careful perusal of all known surviving correspondence and papers of Andrew Ellicott and of Pierre Charles L'Enfant has likewise failed to reveal mention of Banneker.  This conclusively dispels the legend that after L'Enfant's dismissal and his refusal to make available his plan of the city, Ellicott was able to reconstruct it in detail from Banneker's recollection. Equally untrue are legends that Thomas Jefferson as Secretary of State invited Banneker to luncheon at the White House.

The single notable exception is Silvio A. Bedini's ''The Life of Benjamin Banneker'' (New York, 1972), a work of painstaking research and scrupulous attention to accuracy which also benefits from the author's discovery of important and hitherto unavailable manuscript sources. However, as Bedini points out, the story of Banneker's involvement in the survey of the Federal District \"rests on extremely meager documentation\" (p. 104). This consists of a single mention by TJ, two brief statements by Banneker himself, and the newspaper allusion quoted above. In consequence, Bedini's otherwise reliable biography accepts the version of Banneker's role in this episode as presented in reminiscences of nineteenth-century authors.

The single notable exception is Silvio A. Bedini's ''The Life of Benjamin Banneker'' (New York, 1972), a work of painstaking research and scrupulous attention to accuracy which also benefits from the author's discovery of important and hitherto unavailable manuscript sources. However, as Bedini points out, the story of Banneker's involvement in the survey of the Federal District \"rests on extremely meager documentation\" (p. 104). This consists of a single mention by TJ, two brief statements by Banneker himself, and the newspaper allusion quoted above. In consequence, Bedini's otherwise reliable biography accepts the version of Banneker's role in this episode as presented in reminiscences of nineteenth-century authors. These recollections, deriving in large part from members of the Ellicott family, who were prompted by Quaker inclinations to justice and equality, have compounded the confusion. The nature of TJ's connection with Banneker is treated in the Editorial Note to the group of documents under 30 Aug. 1791, but because of the obscured record it is necessary here to attempt a clarification of the role of this modest, self-taught tobacco farmer in the laying out of the national capital.<br>First of all, because of unwarranted claims to the contrary, it must be pointed out that there is no evidence whatever that Banneker had anything to do with the survey of the Federal City or indeed with the final establishment of the boundaries of the Federal District. All available testimony shows that he was present only during the few weeks early in 1791 when the rough preliminary survey of the ten mile square was made; that, after this was concluded and before the final survey was begun, he returned to his farm and his astronomical studies in April, accompanying Ellicott part way on his brief journey back to Philadelphia; and that thenceforth he had no connection with the mapping of the seat of government. ...<br/>In any case, Banneker's participation in the surveying of the Federal District was unquestionably brief and his role uncertain.}}</ref><ref>(1) [https://archive.org/stream/bulletinunitedst2311964unit#page/n8/mode/1up Bedini, 1964.]<br>(2) [http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/rchs_1969.pdf Bedini, 1969.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171007223056/http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/rchs_1969.pdf |date=October 7, 2017 }}<br>(3) [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00silv/page/n8/mode/1up Bedini, 1972.]<br>(4) Bedini, 1991.<br>(5) [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00bedi/page/n7/mode/1up Bedini,1999.]<br>(6) [https://web.archive.org/web/20160310095152/http://www.amazon.com/The-Life-Benjamin-Banneker-African-American/dp/0938420593#customerReviews Murdock]<br>(7) [https://web.archive.org/web/20140426233224/http://www.profsurv.com/magazine/article.aspx?i=567 Toscano, 2000.]<br>(8) [http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Benjamin_Banneker.aspx Bedini, 2008.]</ref>\n\nIn a 1969 publication, Bedini reported that a story connecting Banneker with the survey and planning of the federal city had appeared within a work that a member of the Ellicott family had edited.

Major Andrew Ellicott, one of the Ellicott boys, was named Chief Surveyor. At Jefferson's request, Banneker was appointed as the third member of the team.<br/>The assignment was to define the boundaries of the new city and then design and lay out its streets and major buildings. Banneker worked closely with L'Enfant and his maps. But the bureaucrats of that day did not take kindly to a foreigner being given so much power and authority and they interfered in many frustrating ways.  This resulted in the highly sensitive and hot-tempered L'Enfant resigning his position and returning to France, taking all of the plans and maps with him. Everyone was dismayed and Jefferson called a meeting of the men involved. What was to be done? Start all over again after more than a year's work? Dispair and frustration showed on their faces. Suddenly Banneker asked, \"Did you like the plans that were made?\" All eyes turned to him. \"Of course, but we don't have them.\" \"I think I can reproduce them from memory\", said Banneker. The men were astounded and somewhat skeptical. Banneker then went home, and because of his remarkable memory, was able to reproduce all the plans in two days.

Although the exact date of Banneker's departure from the survey is not specified in Ellicott's report of expenditures, it occurred sometime late in the month of April 1791, following the arrival of one of Ellicott's brothers. It was not until some ten months after Banneker's departure from the scene that L'Enfant was dismissed, by means of a letter from Jefferson dated February 27, 1792. This conclusively dispels any basis for the legend that after L'Enfant's dismissal and his refusal to make available his plan of the city, Banneker recollected the plan in detail from which Ellicott was able to reconstruct it.

On Concept Formation tasks, the individual has to apply concepts by inferring the underlying \"rules\" for solving visual puzzles that are presented in increasing levels of difficulty. Individuals at the preschool level have to point to a shape that is different from others in a set. As the level of difficulty increases, individuals increasingly demonstrate an understanding of what constitutes a key difference (or the \"rule\") for solving puzzles involving one to one comparisons, and on later items identifying common differences among a set of items. For more difficult items, individuals need to understand the concept of \"and\" (e.g. solution must have some of this and some of that) and the concept of \"or\" (e.g. to be inside a box, the item must be either this or that). The most difficult items require fluid transformations and cognitive shifting between the various types of concept puzzles that the examinee has worked with previously.<ref name=\"Schrank\">{{cite book |last1=Schrank |first1=F.

In the Analysis-Synthesis test, the individual has to learn and orally state the solutions to incomplete logic puzzles that mimic a miniature mathematics system. The test also contains some of the features involved in using symbolic formulations in other fields such as chemistry and logic. The individual is presented with a set of logic rules, a \"key\" that is used to solve the puzzles. The individual has to determine the missing colors within each of the puzzles using the key. Complex items present puzzles that require two or more sequential mental manipulations of the key to derive a final solution.

This task assesses the child's ability to discover the underlying characteristic (e.g. rule, concept, trend, class membership) that governs a set of materials. Matrix Reasoning also tests this ability as well as the ability to start with stated rules, premises, or conditions and to engage in one or more steps to reach a solution to a novel problem (deduction). In the Matrix Reasoning test, children are presented a series or sequence of pictures with one picture missing. Their task is to choose the picture that fits the series or sequence from an array of five options. Since Matrix Reasoning and Picture Concepts involve the use of visual stimuli and do not require expressive language, they are considered to be non-verbal tests of Gf.<ref name=\"Flanagan\" />\n\nWithin the corporate environment, fluid intelligence is a predictor of a person's capacity to work well in environments characterised by complexity, uncertainty, and ambiguity.

On Concept Formation tasks, the individual has to apply concepts by inferring the underlying \"rules\" for solving visual puzzles that are presented in increasing levels of difficulty. Individuals at the preschool level have to point to a shape that is different from others in a set. As the level of difficulty increases, individuals increasingly demonstrate an understanding of what constitutes a key difference (or the \"rule\") for solving puzzles involving one to one comparisons, and on later items identifying common differences among a set of items. For more difficult items, individuals need to understand the concept of \"and\" (e.g. solution must have some of this and some of that) and the concept of \"or\" (e.g. to be inside a box, the item must be either this or that). The most difficult items require fluid transformations and cognitive shifting between the various types of concept puzzles that the examinee has worked with previously.<ref name=\"Schrank\">{{cite book |last1=Schrank |first1=F.

In the Analysis-Synthesis test, the individual has to learn and orally state the solutions to incomplete logic puzzles that mimic a miniature mathematics system. The test also contains some of the features involved in using symbolic formulations in other fields such as chemistry and logic. The individual is presented with a set of logic rules, a \"key\" that is used to solve the puzzles. The individual has to determine the missing colors within each of the puzzles using the key. Complex items present puzzles that require two or more sequential mental manipulations of the key to derive a final solution. Increasingly difficult items involve a mix of puzzles that require fluid shifts in deduction, logic, and inference.<ref name=\"Schrank\" /> Analysis Synthesis tasks assess general sequential reasoning.\n\nIn the [[Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children]]-IV (WISC IV),<ref>{{cite book |last1=Wechsler |first1=D. |year=2003 |title=WISC-IV technical and interpretive manual |location=San Antonio, TX |publisher=Psychological Corporation}}{{page needed|date=December 2012}}</ref> the Perceptual Reasoning Index contains two subtests that assess Gf: Matrix Reasoning, which involves induction and deduction, and Picture Concepts, which involves induction.<ref name=\"Flanagan\">{{cite book |last1=Flanagan |first1=D.

This task assesses the child's ability to discover the underlying characteristic (e.g. rule, concept, trend, class membership) that governs a set of materials. Matrix Reasoning also tests this ability as well as the ability to start with stated rules, premises, or conditions and to engage in one or more steps to reach a solution to a novel problem (deduction). In the Matrix Reasoning test, children are presented a series or sequence of pictures with one picture missing. Their task is to choose the picture that fits the series or sequence from an array of five options. Since Matrix Reasoning and Picture Concepts involve the use of visual stimuli and do not require expressive language, they are considered to be non-verbal tests of Gf.<ref name=\"Flanagan\" />\n\nWithin the corporate environment, fluid intelligence is a predictor of a person's capacity to work well in environments characterised by complexity, uncertainty, and ambiguity.

It maps these against suitable work environments according to [[Elliott Jacques]] Stratified Systems Theory.\n\n==Development and physiology==\n\nFluid intelligence, like [[reaction time]], typically peaks in young adulthood and then steadily declines.

The book is part biography, and part polemic on race and class. The overall ideological framework of the book is a pragmatic, socialist-oriented Pan-Africanism that seeks the liberation of all humanity from oppression and exploitation. At the same time, it highlights the shared problems faced by African communities worldwide in a global system of imperialism.<ref>https://www.invent-the-future.org/2018/05/book-review-akala-natives/</ref>\n\nDaley takes his escape from poverty not as proof of personal exceptionalism but of the vagaries and chaotic injustice of race, class and privilege. There is no blindness to the fact that a different fall of the dice might have led to a radically different outcome.<ref>https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/may/24/natives-race-class-ruins-empire-akala-review</ref> Daley asserts that Britain is not a meritocracy where the barriers of race and class can be simply overcome through hard work and perseverance. He explains his success as the absurd and unexpected consequence of an unequal system that allows the rise of a few while leaving behind the many, no matter how brilliant they are. He points out several times that some of his friends could have been academics or scientists if the obstacles of structural racism and class oppression had not been there.<ref>http://socialistreview.org.uk/438/natives</ref>\n\nOne important idea that emerges from Natives is that, in spite of Britain's record of violence, slavery, genocide and colonialism, there is nonetheless a longstanding progressive trend that is \u201crooted in ideas of freedom, equality and democracy\u201d.<ref>https://www.invent-the-future.org/2018/05/book-review-akala-natives/</ref>\n\n==Political views==\nIn June 2016, Akala supported [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] leader [[Jeremy Corbyn]] after mass resignations from his cabinet and a [[2016 Labour Party (UK) leadership election|leadership challenge]].

He wrote in ''[[The Guardian]]'': \"So why will I be voting now? Jeremy Corbyn. It's not that I am na\u00efve enough to believe that one man (who is, of course, powerless without the people that support him) can fundamentally alter the nature of British politics, or that I think that if Labour wins that the UK will suddenly reflect his personal political convictions, or even that I believe that the prime minister actually runs the country.

The book is part biography, and part polemic on race and class. The overall ideological framework of the book is a pragmatic, socialist-oriented Pan-Africanism that seeks the liberation of all humanity from oppression and exploitation. At the same time, it highlights the shared problems faced by African communities worldwide in a global system of imperialism.<ref>https://www.invent-the-future.org/2018/05/book-review-akala-natives/</ref>\n\nDaley takes his escape from poverty not as proof of personal exceptionalism but of the vagaries and chaotic injustice of race, class and privilege. There is no blindness to the fact that a different fall of the dice might have led to a radically different outcome.<ref>https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/may/24/natives-race-class-ruins-empire-akala-review</ref> Daley asserts that Britain is not a meritocracy where the barriers of race and class can be simply overcome through hard work and perseverance. He explains his success as the absurd and unexpected consequence of an unequal system that allows the rise of a few while leaving behind the many, no matter how brilliant they are. He points out several times that some of his friends could have been academics or scientists if the obstacles of structural racism and class oppression had not been there.<ref>http://socialistreview.org.uk/438/natives</ref>\n\nOne important idea that emerges from Natives is that, in spite of Britain's record of violence, slavery, genocide and colonialism, there is nonetheless a longstanding progressive trend that is \u201crooted in ideas of freedom, equality and democracy\u201d.<ref>https://www.invent-the-future.org/2018/05/book-review-akala-natives/</ref>\n\n==Political views==\nIn June 2016, Akala supported [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] leader [[Jeremy Corbyn]] after mass resignations from his cabinet and a [[2016 Labour Party (UK) leadership election|leadership challenge]]. He [[Twitter|tweeted]]: \"The way these dickhead Labor MP's are snaking @jeremycorbyn eediat ting.\"<ref name=\"twitter\">{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/akalamusic/status/748236119326744576|title=The way these dickhead Labor MP's are snaking @jeremycorbyn eediat ting.|publisher=[[Twitter]]|date=29 June 2016|accessdate=15 July 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn May 2017, he endorsed Corbyn in the [[2017 United Kingdom general election|2017 UK general election]]. He wrote in ''[[The Guardian]]'': \"So why will I be voting now? Jeremy Corbyn. It's not that I am na\u00efve enough to believe that one man (who is, of course, powerless without the people that support him) can fundamentally alter the nature of British politics, or that I think that if Labour wins that the UK will suddenly reflect his personal political convictions, or even that I believe that the prime minister actually runs the country.

The motifs are then transferred to larger canvases or grounds, on which the artist uses the formal language of [[Hard-edge painting]] to \"gain a sense of clarity in the interaction of colors\". His art is also about bringing together the \"light, spirit and atmosphere\" of various locations around the world that have inspired him.<ref>Sebastian Helling & Richard Schur,  ''Wall Street International, Art''.
