Over the centuries it underwent transformations, suspensions and name changes that reflected the geo-political complexities of this part of Europe. The present institution can be dated to 1940. It is located in the historic city of [[Lviv]] in [[Lviv Oblast]] of [[Western Ukraine]]. \n\n== History ==\n=== Beginnings ===\nThe university was founded on January 20, 1661, when King [[John II Casimir]] of Poland granted a charter to the city's [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] Collegium, founded in 1608, giving it \"the honour of an academy and the title of a university\". The Jesuits had tried to found a university earlier, in 1589, but did not succeed. Establishing another seat of learning in the [[Crown of the Kingdom of Poland|Kingdom of Poland]] was seen as a threat by the authorities of [[Krak\u00f3w]]'s [[Jagiellonian University]], which did not want a rival and which for many years managed to stymy the Jesuits' plans.\n\nAccording to the [[Treaty of Hadiach]] (1658), an [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] [[Ruthenian language|Ruthenian]] academy was to be created in [[Kiev]] and another one in an unspecified location. The Jesuits suspected that it would be established in Lw\u00f3w/Lviv on the foundations of the [[Brotherhood (Orthodox lay societies)|Orthodox Brotherhood]]'s school, and used this as a pretext for obtaining a royal mandate that elevated their own college to the status of an academy (no city could have two academies).<ref>{{cite book|last1=Isaievych|first1=Iaroslav|title=Voluntary Brotherhood: Confraternities of Laymen in Early Modern Ukraine|date=2006|publisher=Canadian Institute of Ukrainian Studies|page=153}}</ref><ref name=\"Poli\">{{cite book|last1=Wole\u0144ski|first1=Jan|editor1-last=Poli|editor1-first=Roberto|title=In Itinere: European Cities and the Birth of Modern Scientific Philosophy|date=1997|publisher=Rodopi|pages=163, 165|chapter=Lvov}}</ref> King John II Casimir was a supporter of the Jesuits and his stance was crucial. The original royal charter was subsequently confirmed by another decree issued in [[Cz\u0119stochowa]] on February 5, 1661.\n\nIn 1758 King [[Augustus III of Poland|Augustus III]] issued a decree, which described the Collegium as an academy, equal in fact status to the [[Jagiellonian University]], with two faculties, those of [[Theology]] and [[Philosophy]].\n\n=== Austrian rule ===\nIn 1772 the city of Lw\u00f3w was annexed by [[Austria]] (see: [[Partitions of Poland]]). Its German name was [[Lemberg]] and hence that of the university. In 1773 the [[Suppression of the Society of Jesus]] by Rome ([[Dominus ac Redemptor]]) was soon followed by the partition of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth which meant that the university was excluded from the [[Commission of National Education]] reform. It was renamed ''Theresianum'' by the Austrians, i.e. a State Academy. On 21 October 1784 the Austrian Emperor [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]] signed an act of foundation of a secular university.<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite web|url= http://www.encyclopediaofukraine.com/display.asp?linkpath=pages%5Cl%5Cv%5Clvivuniversity.htm|title= Lviv University \u2013 Internet Encyclopedia of Ukraine }}</ref>  He began to Germanise the institution by bringing German-speaking professors from the various parts of the empire. The university now had four faculties. To theology and philosophy were added those of [[law]] and [[medicine]]. Latin was the official language of the university, with Polish and German as auxiliary. Literary Slaveno-Rusyn (Ruthenian/Ukrainian) of the period had been used in the Studium Ruthenum (1787\u20131809), a special institute of the university for educating candidates for the Uniate (Greek-Catholic) priesthood.<ref>Magocsi, Paul R. A history of Ukraine: the land and its peoples. University of Toronto Press, 2010. Pg. 425.</ref>\n\nIn 1805 the university was closed, as Austria, then involved in the [[Napoleonic wars]], did not have sufficient funds to support it. Instead, it operated as a high school. The university was reopened in 1817.<ref name=\"auto\"/>  Officially Vienna described it as an \"act of mercy\", but the actual reasons were different. The Austrian government was aware of the pro-Polish stance of the Russian Emperor [[Alexander I of Russia|Alexander I]] and the Austrians wanted to challenge it. However, the quality of the university's education was not considered high. Latin was replaced by German and most professors were mediocre. The few good ones regarded their stay in Lemberg as a springboard to other centres.{{fact|date=June 2019}}\n\nIn 1848, when the pan-European revolution reached Lemberg (see: [[Revolutions of 1848]]), students of the university created two organizations: \"The Academic Legion\" and \"the Academic Committee\" both of which demanded that the university be [[Polonization|polonized]]. The government in Vienna answered with force, and on November 2, 1848, the centre of the city was shelled by the troops led by General Hammerstein striking the buildings of the university, especially its library. A curfew was called and the university was temporarily closed. A major demand for Ukrainians was the education of teachers and promotion of Ukrainian culture through Ukrainian courses at the university and to this end a committee for the Defense of Ukrainian Education was created.<ref name= Bohachevsky-Chomiak >Bohachevsky-Chomiak, Martha.

After a few years the Austrians relented and on July 4,{{fact|date=June 2019}} 1871 Vienna declared Polish and Ruthenian (Ukrainian) as the official languages at the university.<ref name=StraussPT196>Strauss, Johann. \"Language and power in the late Ottoman Empire\" (Chapter 7).

The Austrian authorities declared Polish as the main teaching medium with Ruthenian and German as auxiliary. Examinations in the two latter languages were possible as long as the professors used them. This move created unrest among the Ruthenians (Ukrainians), who were demanding equal rights. In 1908, a Ruthenian student of the philosophy faculty, [[Miroslaw Siczynski]], had assassinated the Polish governor of [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galicia]], [[Andrzej Potocki]].{{fact|date=June 2019}}\n\nMeanwhile, the University of Lemberg thrived, being one of two Polish language universities in Galicia, the other one was the Jagiellonian University in Krak\u00f3w. Its professors were famous across Europe, with such renowned names as [[Wladyslaw Abraham]], [[Oswald Balzer]], [[Szymon Askenazy]], [[Stanislaw Zakrzewski]], [[Zygmunt Janiszewski]], [[Kazimierz Twardowski]], [[Benedykt Dybowski]], [[Marian Smoluchowski]] and [[Ludwik Rydygier]].\n\nIn the 1870s [[Ivan Franko]] studied at Lemberg University. He entered the world history as a well-known Ukrainian scholar, public figure, writer and translator. In 1894, the newly founded Chair of World History and the History of Eastern Europe was headed by Professor [[Mykhailo Hrushevskyi]] (1866\u20131934), the most outstanding scholar of Ukrainian History, author of the ten-volume \"History of Ukraine-Rus'\", hundreds of works on History, History of Literature, Historiography, and Source Studies, and founder of the Ukrainian Historical School. In 1904, a special summer course in Ukrainian studies was organized in Lviv, primarily for Eastern Ukrainian students.<ref name= Bohachevsky-Chomiak />{{rp|124}}  \n\nThe number of students grew from 1,732 in 1897 to 3,582 in 1906. Poles made up around 75% of the students, Ukrainians 20%, other nationalities 5%.<ref name=\"Poli\"/>\nIn mid-December 1910, Ukrainian women students at Lviv University established a Student Union's women's branch, their twenty members meeting regularly to discuss current affairs.

On February 26, 1920, the university was rehoused by the Polish government in the building formerly used by the [[Sejm of the Land]], which has since been the university's main location. Its first [[Rector (academia)|rector]] during the Second Polish Republic was the famous poet, [[Jan Kasprowicz]].\n\nIn 1924 the Philosophy Faculty was divided into [[Humanities]] and Mathematics and Biology Departments, thus there were now five faculties. In the 1934/35 academic year, the breakdown of the student body was as follows:\n* Theology \u2013 222 students\n* Law \u2013 2,978 students \n* Medicine \u2013 638 students (together with the Pharmaceutical Section, which had 263 students) \n* Humanities \u2013 892 students \n* Mathematics and Biology \u2013 870 students \n\nAltogether, during the academic year 1934/35, there were 5900 students at the university, consisting by religious observance of:\n* 3793 Roman Catholics (64.3%)\n* 1211 Jews (20.5%)\n* 739 Greek-Catholics (12.5%)\n* 72 Orthodox (1.2%)\n* 67 Protestants (1.1%)\n\nUkrainian professors were required to take a formal oath of allegiance to Poland; most of them refused and left the university in the early 1920s. The principle of \"[[Numerus clausus]]\" had been introduced after which Ukrainian applicants were discriminated against \u2013 Ukrainian applications were capped at 15% of the intake, whereas Poles enjoyed a 50% quota at the time.<ref name=\"National University of L'viv\">[http://www.lnu.edu.ua/general/about.htm Brief history of L'viv University] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130513221016/http://www.lnu.edu.ua/general/about.htm |date=2013-05-13 }}</ref>\n\n=== Ivan Franko University ===\n{{Infobox world university ranking\n| ARWU_W =  | ARWU_W_ref =\n| THE_W =1001+ | THE_W_ref =<ref>https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/2020/world-ranking#!/page/0/length/25/locations/UA/sort_by/rank/sort_order/asc/cols/stats</ref>\n}}\nIn 1939, after the German [[invasion of Poland]] and the [[Soviet invasion of Poland (1939)|accompanying Soviet invasion]], the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] administration permitted classes to continue.

On October 18, however, the Polish rector, Professor [[Roman Longchamps de B\u00e9rier]], was dismissed, and was replaced by a prominent Ukrainian historian, [[Mykhailo Marchenko]], grandfather of Ukrainian journalist and dissident [[Valeriy Marchenko]].

Over the centuries it underwent transformations, suspensions and name changes that reflected the geo-political complexities of this part of Europe. The present institution can be dated to 1940. It is located in the historic city of [[Lviv]] in [[Lviv Oblast]] of [[Western Ukraine]]. \n\n== History ==\n=== Beginnings ===\nThe university was founded on January 20, 1661, when King [[John II Casimir]] of Poland granted a charter to the city's [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] Collegium, founded in 1608, giving it \"the honour of an academy and the title of a university\". The Jesuits had tried to found a university earlier, in 1589, but did not succeed. Establishing another seat of learning in the [[Crown of the Kingdom of Poland|Kingdom of Poland]] was seen as a threat by the authorities of [[Krak\u00f3w]]'s [[Jagiellonian University]], which did not want a rival and which for many years managed to stymy the Jesuits' plans.\n\nAccording to the [[Treaty of Hadiach]] (1658), an [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] [[Ruthenian language|Ruthenian]] academy was to be created in [[Kiev]] and another one in an unspecified location. The Jesuits suspected that it would be established in Lw\u00f3w/Lviv on the foundations of the [[Brotherhood (Orthodox lay societies)|Orthodox Brotherhood]]'s school, and used this as a pretext for obtaining a royal mandate that elevated their own college to the status of an academy (no city could have two academies).<ref>{{cite book|last1=Isaievych|first1=Iaroslav|title=Voluntary Brotherhood: Confraternities of Laymen in Early Modern Ukraine|date=2006|publisher=Canadian Institute of Ukrainian Studies|page=153}}</ref><ref name=\"Poli\">{{cite book|last1=Wole\u0144ski|first1=Jan|editor1-last=Poli|editor1-first=Roberto|title=In Itinere: European Cities and the Birth of Modern Scientific Philosophy|date=1997|publisher=Rodopi|pages=163, 165|chapter=Lvov}}</ref> King John II Casimir was a supporter of the Jesuits and his stance was crucial. The original royal charter was subsequently confirmed by another decree issued in [[Cz\u0119stochowa]] on February 5, 1661.\n\nIn 1758 King [[Augustus III of Poland|Augustus III]] issued a decree, which described the Collegium as an academy, equal in fact status to the [[Jagiellonian University]], with two faculties, those of [[Theology]] and [[Philosophy]].\n\n=== Austrian rule ===\nIn 1772 the city of Lw\u00f3w was annexed by [[Austria]] (see: [[Partitions of Poland]]). Its German name was [[Lemberg]] and hence that of the university. In 1773 the [[Suppression of the Society of Jesus]] by Rome ([[Dominus ac Redemptor]]) was soon followed by the partition of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth which meant that the university was excluded from the [[Commission of National Education]] reform. It was renamed ''Theresianum'' by the Austrians, i.e. a State Academy. On 21 October 1784 the Austrian Emperor [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]] signed an act of foundation of a secular university.<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite web|url= http://www.encyclopediaofukraine.com/display.asp?linkpath=pages%5Cl%5Cv%5Clvivuniversity.htm|title= Lviv University \u2013 Internet Encyclopedia of Ukraine }}</ref>  He began to Germanise the institution by bringing German-speaking professors from the various parts of the empire. The university now had four faculties. To theology and philosophy were added those of [[law]] and [[medicine]]. Latin was the official language of the university, with Polish and German as auxiliary. Literary Slaveno-Rusyn (Ruthenian/Ukrainian) of the period had been used in the Studium Ruthenum (1787\u20131809), a special institute of the university for educating candidates for the Uniate (Greek-Catholic) priesthood.<ref>Magocsi, Paul R. A history of Ukraine: the land and its peoples. University of Toronto Press, 2010. Pg. 425.</ref>\n\nIn 1805 the university was closed, as Austria, then involved in the [[Napoleonic wars]], did not have sufficient funds to support it. Instead, it operated as a high school. The university was reopened in 1817.<ref name=\"auto\"/>  Officially Vienna described it as an \"act of mercy\", but the actual reasons were different. The Austrian government was aware of the pro-Polish stance of the Russian Emperor [[Alexander I of Russia|Alexander I]] and the Austrians wanted to challenge it. However, the quality of the university's education was not considered high. Latin was replaced by German and most professors were mediocre. The few good ones regarded their stay in Lemberg as a springboard to other centres.{{fact|date=June 2019}}\n\nIn 1848, when the pan-European revolution reached Lemberg (see: [[Revolutions of 1848]]), students of the university created two organizations: \"The Academic Legion\" and \"the Academic Committee\" both of which demanded that the university be [[Polonization|polonized]]. The government in Vienna answered with force, and on November 2, 1848, the centre of the city was shelled by the troops led by General Hammerstein striking the buildings of the university, especially its library. A curfew was called and the university was temporarily closed. A major demand for Ukrainians was the education of teachers and promotion of Ukrainian culture through Ukrainian courses at the university and to this end a committee for the Defense of Ukrainian Education was created.<ref name= Bohachevsky-Chomiak >Bohachevsky-Chomiak, Martha.

After a few years the Austrians relented and on July 4,{{fact|date=June 2019}} 1871 Vienna declared Polish and Ruthenian (Ukrainian) as the official languages at the university.<ref name=StraussPT196>Strauss, Johann. \"Language and power in the late Ottoman Empire\" (Chapter 7).

The Austrian authorities declared Polish as the main teaching medium with Ruthenian and German as auxiliary. Examinations in the two latter languages were possible as long as the professors used them. This move created unrest among the Ruthenians (Ukrainians), who were demanding equal rights. In 1908, a Ruthenian student of the philosophy faculty, [[Miroslaw Siczynski]], had assassinated the Polish governor of [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galicia]], [[Andrzej Potocki]].{{fact|date=June 2019}}\n\nMeanwhile, the University of Lemberg thrived, being one of two Polish language universities in Galicia, the other one was the Jagiellonian University in Krak\u00f3w. Its professors were famous across Europe, with such renowned names as [[Wladyslaw Abraham]], [[Oswald Balzer]], [[Szymon Askenazy]], [[Stanislaw Zakrzewski]], [[Zygmunt Janiszewski]], [[Kazimierz Twardowski]], [[Benedykt Dybowski]], [[Marian Smoluchowski]] and [[Ludwik Rydygier]].\n\nIn the 1870s [[Ivan Franko]] studied at Lemberg University. He entered the world history as a well-known Ukrainian scholar, public figure, writer and translator. In 1894, the newly founded Chair of World History and the History of Eastern Europe was headed by Professor [[Mykhailo Hrushevskyi]] (1866\u20131934), the most outstanding scholar of Ukrainian History, author of the ten-volume \"History of Ukraine-Rus'\", hundreds of works on History, History of Literature, Historiography, Source Studies, founder of the Ukrainian Historical School. In 1904, a special summer course in Ukrainian studies was organized in Lviv, primarily for Eastern Ukrainian students.<ref name= Bohachevsky-Chomiak />{{rp|124}}  \n\nThe number of students grew from 1,732 in 1897 to 3,582 in 1906. Poles made up around 75% of the students, Ukrainians 20%, other nationalities 5%.<ref name=\"Poli\"/>\nIn mid-December 1910, Ukrainian women students at Lviv University established a Student Union's women's branch, their twenty members meeting regularly to discuss current affairs.

On February 26, 1920, the university was rehoused by the Polish government in the building formerly used by the [[Sejm of the Land]], which has since been the university's main location. Its first [[Rector (academia)|rector]] during the Second Polish Republic was the famous poet, [[Jan Kasprowicz]].\n\nIn 1924 the Philosophy Faculty was divided into [[Humanities]] and Mathematics and Biology Departments, thus there were now five faculties. In the 1934/35 academic year, the breakdown of the student body was as follows:\n* Theology \u2013 222 students\n* Law \u2013 2,978 students \n* Medicine \u2013 638 students (together with the Pharmaceutical Section, which had 263 students) \n* Humanities \u2013 892 students \n* Mathematics and Biology \u2013 870 students \n\nAltogether, during the academic year 1934/35, there were 5900 students at the university, consisting by religious observance of:\n* 3793 Roman Catholics (64.3%)\n* 1211 Jews (20.5%)\n* 739 Greek-Catholics (12.5%)\n* 72 Orthodox (1.2%)\n* 67 Protestants (1.1%)\n\nUkrainian professors were required to take a formal oath of allegiance to Poland; most of them refused and left the university in the early 1920s. The principle of \"[[Numerus clausus]]\" had been introduced after which Ukrainian applicants were discriminated against \u2013 Ukrainian applications were capped at 15% of the intake, whereas Poles enjoyed a 50% quota at the time.<ref name=\"National University of L'viv\">[http://www.lnu.edu.ua/general/about.htm Brief history of L'viv University] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130513221016/http://www.lnu.edu.ua/general/about.htm |date=2013-05-13 }}</ref>\n\n=== Ivan Franko University ===\n{{Infobox world university ranking\n| ARWU_W =  | ARWU_W_ref =\n| THE_W =1001+ | THE_W_ref =<ref>https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/2020/world-ranking#!/page/0/length/25/locations/UA/sort_by/rank/sort_order/asc/cols/stats</ref>\n}}\nIn 1939, after the German [[invasion of Poland]] and the [[Soviet invasion of Poland (1939)|accompanying Soviet invasion]], the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] administration permitted classes to continue. Until late 1939, the school worked in the pre-war Polish system. On October 18, however, the Polish rector, Professor [[Roman Longchamps de B\u00e9rier]], was dismissed, and was replaced by a prominent Ukrainian historian, [[Mykhailo Marchenko]], grandfather of Ukrainian journalist and dissident [[Valeriy Marchenko]].

Built in 1908\u201309, it dates back to the  more prosperous era in [[History of rail transport in the United States|the history of American railroad travel]].  As '''Salt Lake Union Pacific Railroad Station''', it is listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].\n\n==Railway history==\nOriginally called the Union Station, it was jointly constructed by the [[San Pedro, Los Angeles and Salt Lake Railroad]] and the [[Oregon Short Line]], both later wholly owned by the [[Union Pacific]], at an estimated cost of $450,000 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|450000|1900|r=-4}}}} in today's dollars{{Inflation-fn|US}}). The platforms behind the station ran north-to-south, parallel to the first main line built in the Salt Lake Valley, which predated the station building. South of 1300 South this is the route used by the [[UTA TRAX Blue Line]] and [[Salt Lake City Southern Railroad|Salt Lake City Southern]], while north of North Temple (100 North) it is used by the ''[[FrontRunner]]'' line and Union Pacific. Trains from the west used a line south of 900 South in [[Glendale, Salt Lake City|Glendale]] to approach the north-to-south platforms.

Built in 1908\u201309, it dates back to the  more prosperous era in [[History of rail transport in the United States|the history of American railroad travel]].  As '''Salt Lake Union Pacific Railroad Station''', it is listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].\n\n==Railway history==\nOriginally called the Union Station, it was jointly constructed by the [[San Pedro, Los Angeles and Salt Lake Railroad]] and the [[Oregon Short Line]], both later wholly owned by the [[Union Pacific]], at an estimated cost of $450,000 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|450000|1900|r=-4}}}} in today's dollars{{Inflation-fn|US}}). The platforms behind the station ran north-to-south, parallel to the first main line built in the Salt Lake Valley, which predated the station building. South of 1300 South this is the route used by the [[UTA TRAX Blue Line]] and [[Salt Lake City Southern Railroad|Salt Lake City Southern]], while north of North Temple (100 North) it is used by the ''[[FrontRunner]]'' line and Union Pacific. Trains from the west used a line south of 900 South in [[Glendale, Salt Lake City|Glendale]] to approach the north-to-south platforms. The [[Salt Lake and Ogden Railroad|Salt Lake and Ogden]] ([[Simon Bamberger|Bamberger]]) [[Interurban streetcar|Interurban]] line also stopped nearby.

The inclusion of the [[Depeche Mode]] cover, \"Everything Counts\", is a poignant way to imply that the people who built then destroyed their society realized their folly after it was too late.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}\n\n==Track listing==\nAll lyrics written by [[Niklas Sundin]] and [[Anders Frid\u00e9n]]\n{{tracklist\n| title1 = Jotun\n| music1 = [[Jesper Str\u00f6mblad]] & [[Bj\u00f6rn Gelotte]]\n| length1 = 3:53\n| title2 = Food for the Gods\n| music2 = [[Glenn Ljungstr\u00f6m]], Bj\u00f6rn Gelotte & Jesper Str\u00f6mblad\n| length2 = 4:21\n| title3 = Gyroscope \n| music3 = Jesper Str\u00f6mblad\n| length3 = 3:26\n| title4 = Dialogue with the Stars\n| music4 = Bj\u00f6rn Gelotte & Jesper Str\u00f6mblad\n| length4 = 3:00\n| note4 = Instrumental\n| title5 = The Hive\n| music5 = Bj\u00f6rn Gelotte & Jesper Str\u00f6mblad\n| length5 = 4:03 \n| title6 = Jester Script Transfigured\n| music6 = Jesper Str\u00f6mblad\n| length6 = 5:46\n| title7 = Morphing into Primal\n| music7 = Bj\u00f6rn Gelotte, Glenn Ljungstr\u00f6m, Anders Frid\u00e9n & Jesper Str\u00f6mblad\n| length7 = 3:05\n| title8 = Worlds Within the Margin\n| music8 = Glenn Ljungstr\u00f6m & Jesper Str\u00f6mblad\n| length8 = 5:06\n| title9 = Episode 666\n| music9 = Jesper Str\u00f6mblad\n| length9 = 3:45\n| title10 = [[Everything Counts]]\n| music10 = Martin Lee Gore\n| note10 = [[Depeche Mode]] cover\n| length10 = 3:17\n| title11 = Whoracle\n| music11 = Jesper Str\u00f6mblad\n| length11 = 2:44\n| note11 = Instrumental\n|all_writing=|title12=|length12=|title13=|length13=|title14=|length14=|title15=|length15=|title16=|length16=|title17=|length17=|title18=|length18=|title19=|length19=|title20=|length20=|total_length=42:29}}\n\n{{tracklist\n| headline = Deluxe edition\n| collapsed = yes\n| title12 = Clad in Shadows '99\n| length12 = 2:25\n|total_length=44:54\n}}\n\n{{tracklist\n| headline = Japanese & korean  edition\n| collapsed = yes\n| title12 = Goliaths Disarm Their Davids\n| title13 = Acoustic Medley\n| title14 = Behind Space - Live\n}}<br>\n{{tracklist\n| headline = LP bonus track\n| collapsed = yes\n| title12 = Re-cycles\n| note12 = Acoustic Medley renamed\n}}<br>\n {{tracklist\n| headline = 2010 re-issue\n| collapsed = yes\n| title12 = Goliaths Disarm Their Davids\n| length12 = 4:58\n| title13 = Jotun (Live)\n| length13 = 3:38\n| title14 = Food for the Gods (Live)\n| length14 = 4:11\n}}\n\n==Personnel==\n;In Flames\n*[[Anders Frid\u00e9n]] - [[Singing|vocals]], additional [[Percussion instrument|percussion]]\n*[[Jesper Str\u00f6mblad]] - [[lead guitar]], [[Keyboard instrument|keyboards]], additional percussion\n*[[Glenn Ljungstr\u00f6m]] - [[rhythm guitar]]\n*[[Johan Larsson (musician)|Johan Larsson]] - [[bass guitar|bass]]\n*[[Bj\u00f6rn Gelotte]] - [[Drum kit|drums]], percussion & additional lead guitar\n\n;Other personnel\n*Ulrika Netterdahl - female vocals on \"Whoracle\"\n*The ''Whoracle'' concept conjured and verbalized by [[Niklas Sundin]] and Anders Frid\u00e9n.\n*Lyrics written by Niklas Sundin following original synopsis by Anders Frid\u00e9n.\n*All music composed and arranged by In Flames except \"Everything Counts\" by [[Martin Lee Gore]] of [[Depeche Mode]].\n*Recorded and produced by [[Fredrik Nordstr\u00f6m]] with assistance from In Flames.\n*Engineered by Anders Frid\u00e9n and Fredrik Nordstr\u00f6m.\n*Mixed by Fredrik Nordstr\u00f6m and Anders Frid\u00e9n.\n*Mastered by Goran Finnberg and Fredrik Nordstrom at the Mastering Room Gbg.\n*Cover artwork by Andreas Marschall.\n*Photos by [[Kenneth Johansson]].\n*All songs published by Prophecies Publishing Hamburg except \"Everything Counts\".\n*\"Everything Counts\" published by Grabbing Hands Music Ltd, sub-published by [[EMI|EMI Music Germany]].\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n{{In Flames}}\n\n[[Category:In Flames albums]]\n[[Category:Nuclear Blast albums]]\n[[Category:1997 albums]]\n[[Category:Concept albums]]\n[[Category:Albums recorded at Studio Fredman]]\n[[Category:Albums produced by Fredrik Nordstr\u00f6m]]\n", "name_user": "Urgal", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200ePersonnel", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whoracle"}

Soon afterwards, more and more staffers came forwards with evidence that Hwayoung had been disrespectful to the other members as well as stylists, and had faked how severe her initial injury was in order to get more sympathy. Hwayoung initially tried to deny the rumours, lashing out at the staffers in return, but eventually admitted that the texts were real. After suffering from an intense backlash, including being removed from several television shows, Hwayoung deleted her Instagram account.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://entertain.naver.com/read?oid=433&aid=0000025379 |title=[\ub2e8\ub3c5&#93; \"\uac70\uc758, \ubd09\ud569 \uc9c1\uc804\uc774\uc5c8\ub2e4\"\u2026\ud2f0\uc544\ub77c \uc0ac\ud0dc, 3\ubc154\uc77c\uc758 \uc804\ub9d0 :: \ub124\uc774\ubc84 TV\uc5f0\uc608 |language=ko|website=Entertain.naver.com |date= |accessdate=2017-05-06}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.nate.com/view/20170216n04955?mid=n1008|title=\"\uc9c4\ud759\ud0d5 \uac1c\uc2f8\uc6c0?\"\u2026\ub958\ud654\uc601, \uc545\ud50c\ub7ec \ud5a5\ud574 \ub300\ub193\uace0 '\ub514\uc2a4'|website=\ub124\uc774\ud2b8\ub274\uc2a4|accessdate=May 6, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://m.entertain.naver.com/read?aid=0002589794&oid=108&lightVersion=off |title=[\u00eb'\u00a8\u00eb?\u2026&#93;\u00ed'\u00b0\u011b\u2022\"\u00eb?\u017a \u011b\u00a7\u20ac\u011b\u2014\u00b0, 3\u00eb\u2026\"\u00eb\u00a7\u0152 \u011b\u2020\"\u00eb\u0104\u0153\u011b?\u0152\u00eb\u00b0\u02dc \u011b\u017e \u011b \u2022 \u011b\u00a4'\u00eb'\u00a8..\u00eb\u00b0\u0153\u00eb\u00a7\u00a4\u00eb?\" \u011b\u2014\u00b0\u0119\u00b8\u00b0, \u011b\u2122\u0153 :: \u00eb\"\u00a4\u011b?\u00b4\u00eb\u02db\" TV\u011b\u2014\u00b0\u011b\u02dc\u02c6 |language=ko|website=M.entertain.naver.com |date=2017-02-13 |accessdate=2017-05-06}}</ref>\n\nOn March 6, 2017, MBK Entertainment announced that T-ara will be releasing their final album in May, with Soyeon and Boram terminating their contracts after its release.\u00b7<ref>{{cite web|url=http://m.entertain.naver.com/music/now/read?oid=311&aid=0000708883 |script-title=ko:\ud2f0\uc544\ub77c, 5\uc6d4 \ucd08 \uc644\uc804\uccb4 \ucef4\ubc31 \ud655\uc815\u202613\ubc88\uc9f8 \ubbf8\ub2c8\uc568\ubc94(\uacf5\uc2dd\uc785\uc7a5)|language=ko|website=M.entertain.naver.com |date=2016-08-29 |accessdate=2017-05-06}}</ref> Qri, Eunjung, Hyomin, and Jiyeon will stay with the label until December 31, 2017.<ref name=last/> On May 7, MBK Entertainment revealed the group's plans had changed, and that the final album had been rescheduled to release in June 2017, with members Boram and Soyeon not being able to partake due to the expiry of their contracts.<ref name=final>{{cite web|url=http://entertain.naver.com/music/now/read?oid=108&aid=0002612370|title=\ud2f0\uc544\ub77c \"\uc644\uc804\uccb4 15\uc77c \ub05d+4\uc778 \ud65c\ub3d9+\ubcf4\ub78c\u00b7\uc18c\uc5f0 \uc751\uc6d0\"(\uacf5\uc2dd)|accessdate=June 10, 2017}}</ref> On May 8, it was announced that T-ara's last performance as six-members will be in Taiwan concert on May 13.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.nate.com/view/20170508n27978?mid=n0107|title=\ud2f0\uc544\ub77c \uce21 \"\ub300\ub9cc \ucf58\uc11c\ud2b8\uc11c \uc644\uc804\uccb4\ub85c \ubb34\ub300 \ud3bc\uce60 \uc608\uc815\"(\uacf5\uc2dd\uc785\uc7a5)|website=\ub124\uc774\ud2b8\ub274\uc2a4|accessdate=June 10, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.nate.com/view/20170508n26110?mid=n0107|title=[\ub2e8\ub3c5] \ud2f0\uc544\ub77c \uc18c\uc5f0\u00b7\ubcf4\ub78c, \ub300\ub9cc \ucf58\uc11c\ud2b8\uc11c \ub9c8\uc9c0\ub9c9 \uc778\uc0ac \"\uc644\uc804\uccb4 \ud65c\ub3d9 \ub05d\"|website=\ub124\uc774\ud2b8\ub274\uc2a4|accessdate=June 10, 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe remaining four members continued as a group with releasing their ninth [[extended plays]] and last promotional album, ''[[What's My Name?

His first term was marked with increased industrialization and the creation of solid infrastructures nationwide, such as the [[North Luzon Expressway]] and the [[Maharlika Highway]]. Marcos did this by appointing a cabinet composed mostly of [[technocrat]]s and intellectuals, by increasing funding to the [[Armed Forces of the Philippines|Armed Forces]] and mobilizing them to help in construction. Marcos also established schools and learning institutions nationwide, more than the combined total of those established by his predecessors.{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}}\n\nIn 1968, Senator [[Benigno Aquino Jr.|Benigno S.

On the presidential palace, activists rammed the gate with a fire truck and once the gate broke and gave way, the activists charged into the Palace grounds tossing rocks, pillboxes and Molotov cocktails.

One of them is to abort the subversive plan now by the sudden arrest of the plotters. But this would not be accepted by the people. Nor could we get the Huks (Communists), their legal cadres and support. Nor the MIM (Maoist International Movement) and other subversive [or front] organizations, nor those underground.

Two grenades were reportedly tossed on stage, injuring almost everybody present. As a result, Marcos suspended the [[writ of habeas corpus]] to arrest those behind the attack. He rounded up a list of supposed suspects, Escabas, and other undesirables to eliminate rivals in the Liberal Party.\n\nBased on interviews of [[The Washington Post]] with former Communist Party of the Philippines Officials, it was revealed that \"the (Communist) party leadership planned -- and three operatives carried out -- the attack in an attempt to provoke government repression and push the country to the brink of revolution... (Communist Party Leader) Sison had calculated that Marcos could be provoked into cracking down on his opponents, thereby driving thousands of political activists into the underground, the former party officials said.

Diokno]], virtually turning the Philippines into a [[totalitarian dictatorship]] with Marcos as its Supreme Leader. Initially, the declaration of martial law was well received, given the social turmoil of the period. Crime rates decreased significantly after a curfew was implemented. Political opponents were allowed to go into exile. As martial law went on for the next nine years, the excesses committed by the military increased. In total, there were 3,257 extrajudicial killings, 35,000 individual tortures, and 70,000 were incarcerated.

Worse, political motivations were ascribed to be behind the proclamation, since the then constitutionally non-extendable term of President Marcos was about to expire. This suspicion became more credible when opposition leaders and outspoken anti-administration media people were immediately placed under indefinite detention in military camps and other unusual restrictions were imposed on travel, communication, freedom of speech and the press, etc. In a word, the martial law regime was anathema to no small portion of the populace.<ref>{{cite web|title=G.R.

In brief, the central idea that emerged was that martial law might be earlier lifted, but to safeguard the Philippines and its people against any abrupt dangerous situation which would warrant the some exercise of totalitarian powers, the latter must be constitutionally allowed, thereby eliminating the need to proclaim martial law and its concomitants, principally the assertion by the military of prerogatives that made them appear superior to the civilian authorities below the President.

Sen. Aquino, then in jail, decided to run as leader of his party, the ''[[LABAN|Lakas ng Bayan]]'' party, but they did not win any seats in the ''Batasan'', despite public support and their apparent victory. The night before the elections, supporters of the LABAN party showed their solidarity by setting up a \"noise barrage\" in Manila, creating noise the whole night until dawn.\n\n==The Fourth Republic (1981\u20131986)==\n\nThe [[Opposition (politics)|opposition]] boycotted the June 16, 1981 [[1981 Philippine presidential election and referendum|presidential election]], which pitted Marcos and his ''[[Kilusang Bagong Lipunan]]'' party against retired Gen. [[Alejo Santos]] of the [[Nacionalista Party]]. Marcos won by a margin of over 16 million votes, which constitutionally allowed him to have another six-year term. Finance Minister [[Cesar Virata]] was elected as Prime Minister by the ''[[Batasang Pambansa]]''.\n\nIn 1983, opposition leader [[Benigno Aquino Jr.|Benigno \"Ninoy\" Aquino Jr.]] was [[Assassination of Benigno Aquino, Jr.|assassinated]] at [[Manila International Airport]] upon his return to the Philippines after a long period of exile in the United States. This coalesced popular dissatisfaction with Marcos and began a series of events, including pressure from the United States, that culminated in a snap presidential election on February 7, 1986. The opposition united under Aquino's widow, [[Corazon Aquino]], and [[Salvador Laurel]], head of the [[United Nationalists Democratic Organizations]] (UNIDO). The election was marred by widespread reports of violence and tampering with results by both sides.\n\nThe official election canvasser, the [[Commission on Elections (Philippines)|Commission on Elections]] (COMELEC), declared Marcos the winner, despite a walk-out staged by disenfranchised computer technicians on February 9. According to the COMELEC's final tally, Marcos won with 10,807,197 votes to Aquino's 9,291,761 votes. By contrast, the partial 70% tally of NAMFREL, an accredited poll watcher, said Aquino won with 7,835,070 votes to Marcos's 7,053,068.<ref>{{Citation\n|title=A force more powerful: a century of nonviolent conflict\n|authorlink2=Jack DuVall\n|author1=Peter Ackerman\n|authorlink1=Peter Ackerman\n|author2=Jack DuVall\n|publisher=Macmillan\n|year=2001\n|isbn=978-0-312-24050-9\n|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=OVtKS9DCN0kC&pg=PA384 384]\n|url=https://books.google.com/?id=OVtKS9DCN0kC\n}};<br />\n^ {{Citation\n|author=Isabelo T.

His first term was marked with increased industrialization and the creation of solid infrastructures nationwide, such as the [[North Luzon Expressway]] and the [[Maharlika Highway]]. Marcos did this by appointing a cabinet composed mostly of [[technocrat]]s and intellectuals, by increasing funding to the [[Armed Forces of the Philippines|Armed Forces]] and mobilizing them to help in construction.

Initially, the declaration of martial law was well received, given the social turmoil of the period. Crime rates decreased significantly after a curfew was implemented. Political opponents were allowed to go into exile. As martial law went on for the next nine years, the excesses committed by the military increased. In total, there were 3,257 extrajudicial killings, 35,000 individual tortures, and 70,000 were incarcerated.

Worse, political motivations were ascribed to be behind the proclamation, since the then constitutionally non-extendable term of President Marcos was about to expire. This suspicion became more credible when opposition leaders and outspoken anti-administration media people were immediately placed under indefinite detention in military camps and other unusual restrictions were imposed on travel, communication, freedom of speech and the press, etc. In a word, the martial law regime was anathema to no small portion of the populace.<ref>{{cite web|title=G.R.

In brief, the central idea that emerged was that martial law might be earlier lifted, but to safeguard the Philippines and its people against any abrupt dangerous situation which would warrant the some exercise of totalitarian powers, the latter must be constitutionally allowed, thereby eliminating the need to proclaim martial law and its concomitants, principally the assertion by the military of prerogatives that made them appear superior to the civilian authorities below the President.

[[Alejo Santos]] of the [[Nacionalista Party]]. Marcos won by a margin of over 16 million votes, which constitutionally allowed him to have another six-year term.

Supporting roles are played by [[Ed Harris]], [[John C.

The screenplay by [[David Hare (playwright)|David Hare]] is based on [[Michael Cunningham]]'s 1998 [[Pulitzer Prize]]-winning [[The Hours (novel)|novel of the same title]].\n\nThe plot focuses on three women of different generations whose lives are interconnected by the novel ''[[Mrs Dalloway]]'' by [[Virginia Woolf]]. These are Clarissa Vaughan (Streep), a New Yorker preparing an award party for her [[HIV/AIDS|AIDS]]-stricken long-time friend and poet, Richard (Harris) in 2001; Laura Brown (Moore), a pregnant 1950s California housewife in an unhappy marriage with a young son; and Virginia Woolf (Kidman) herself in 1920s England, who is struggling with depression and mental illness while trying to write her novel.\n\nThe film was released in Los Angeles and New York City on [[Christmas|Christmas Day]] 2002, and was given a [[limited release]] in the United States and Canada two days later on December 27, 2002. It did not receive a [[wide release]] in North America until January 2003, and was then released in British cinemas on [[Valentine's Day]] that year.

Virginia, who has experienced several [[Mental breakdown|nervous breakdown]]s and suffers from depression, feels trapped in her home. She is intimidated by servants and constantly under the eye of her husband, [[Leonard Woolf|Leonard]], who has begun a publishing business at home, [[Hogarth Press]], to stay close to her. Virginia's sister, [[Vanessa Bell|Vanessa]], and her children are coming over for an afternoon visit. When Vanessa arrives, she and Virginia talk about Vanessa's life in London and Virginia's mental condition. During the visit Vanessa's children find a dead bird. While Vanessa and her two sons are preparing the bird's grave, Virginia and Vanessa's daughter, Angelica, prepare the bird's funeral. After the funeral is done, Virginia lays down just like the bird and sees herself in the dead bird. Before Vanessa and her children leave, Virginia passionately kisses her sister. Vanessa's visit as well as the dead bird causes Virginia to think about her life. After their departure, Virginia flees to the railway station, where she is awaiting a train to central London. Leonard arrives to bring her home. He tells her how he lives in constant fear that she will take her own life. She says she fears it also but argues that if she is to live, she has the right to decide how and where.\n\n'''1951''' -- Pregnant with her second child, Laura Brown spends her days in her [[Tract housing|tract home]] with her young son, Richie, and escapes from her conventional life by reading ''Mrs Dalloway''. She married her husband, Dan, soon after [[World War II]]. On the surface they are living the [[American Dream]], but she is nonetheless deeply unhappy. She and Richie make a cake for Dan's birthday, but it is a disaster. Her neighbor Kitty drops in to ask her if she can feed her dog while she's in the hospital for a procedure. Kitty reveals that the procedure is related to the fact that she has been unable to conceive, and may portend permanent infertility, and that she really feels that a woman is not complete until she is a mother. Kitty pretends to be upbeat, but Laura senses her sadness and fear and boldly kisses her on the lips; Kitty acts as if it didn't happen. Laura and Richie successfully make another cake and clean up, and then she takes Richie to stay with a babysitter, Mrs. Latch. Richie runs after his mother as she leaves, fearing that she will never come back. Laura checks into a hotel, where she intends to commit suicide. Laura removes several bottles of pills and ''Mrs. Dalloway'' from her purse and begins to read it. She drifts off to sleep and dreams the hotel room is flooded. She awakens with a change of heart and caresses her belly. She picks up Richie, who fearfully tells his mother he loves her, and they return home to celebrate Dan's birthday.\n\n'''2001''' -- New Yorker Clarissa Vaughan is the embodiment of the novel's title character. She spends the day preparing for a party she is hosting in honor of her former lover and friend Richard, a poet and author living with [[HIV/AIDS|AIDS]] who is to receive a major literary award. Clarissa, who is bisexual and has been living with Sally Lester for 10 years, was in a relationship with Richard during their college years. She meets with Richard's ex-lover Louis Waters, who has returned for the festivities. Clarissa's daughter, Julia, comes home to help her prepare. Clarissa visits Richard and he tells Clarissa that he has stayed alive for her sake and that the award is meaningless because he didn't get it sooner, until he was on the brink of death. She tries reassuring him. Richard often refers to Clarissa as \"Mrs. Dalloway\" \u2013 her namesake \u2013 because she distracts herself from her own life the way that the Woolf character does. Richard tells Clarissa that she is the most beautiful thing that he ever had in life, before he commits suicide in front of her. Later that night, Richard's mother, Laura Brown, arrives at Clarissa's apartment. Laura is aware that her abandonment of her family was deeply traumatic for Richard, but Laura reveals that it was a better decision for her to leave the family after the birth of her daughter than to commit suicide. She does not apologize for the hurt that she caused to her family and suggests that it's not possible to feel regret for something over which she had no choice. She acknowledges that no one will forgive her, but she offers an explanation: \"It was death.

''The Hours'' has an 80% \"fresh\" rating on the film review aggregator site [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 192 reviews and an average rating of 7.4/10. The consensus says that \"the movie may be a downer, but it packs an emotional wallop.

And wondering why the screenwriter, David Hare, and the director, Stephen Daldry, turn Woolf, a woman of incisive mind, into a hapless ditherer.\" He also criticized its overt politicization: \"But this movie is in love with female victimization. Moore's Laura is trapped in the suburban flatlands of the '50s, while Streep's Clarissa is moored in a hopeless love for Laura's homosexual son (Ed Harris, in a truly ugly performance), an AIDS sufferer whose relentless anger is directly traceable to Mom's long-ago desertion of him. Somehow, despite the complexity of the film's structure, this all seems too simple-minded. Or should we perhaps say agenda driven? This ultimately proves insufficient to lend meaning to their lives or profundity to a grim and uninvolving film, for which Philip Glass unwittingly provides the perfect score \u2014 tuneless, oppressive, droning, painfully self-important.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1003931,00.html|title=Holiday Movie Preview: The Hours|author=RICHARD SCHICKEL|date=December 23, 2002|accessdate=July 19, 2010|publisher=Time.com}}</ref>\n\n[[Stephen Holden]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' called the film \"deeply moving\" and \"an amazingly faithful screen adaptation\" and added, \"Although suicide eventually tempts three of the film's characters, ''The Hours'' is not an unduly morbid film.

Mr. Glass's surging minimalist score, with its air of cosmic abstraction, serves as ideal connective tissue for a film that breaks down temporal barriers.\"<ref>{{cite news|last=Holden |first=Stephen |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/12/27/movies/27HOUR.html |title=Who's Afraid Like Virginia Woolf? |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=December 27, 2002 |accessdate=July 19, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091204232423/http://www.nytimes.com/2002/12/27/movies/27HOUR.html |archivedate=December 4, 2009}}</ref> [[Mick LaSalle]] of the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' observed, \"Director Stephen Daldry employs the wonderful things cinema can do in order to realize aspects of ''The Hours'' that Cunningham could only hint at or approximate on the page. The result is something rare, especially considering how fine the novel is, a film that's fuller and deeper than the book ... It's marvelous to watch the ways in which [David Hare] consistently dramatizes the original material without compromising its integrity or distorting its intent ... Cunningham's [novel] touched on notes of longing, middle-aged angst and the sense of being a small consciousness in the midst of a grand mystery.

''The Hours'' has an 80% \"fresh\" rating on the film review aggregator site [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 192 reviews and an average rating of 7.4/10. The consensus says that \"the movie may be a downer, but it packs an emotional wallop. Some fine acting on display here.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/hours/|title=''The Hours''|publisher=Rotten Tomatoes|accessdate=July 1, 2010}}</ref> On [[Metacritic]], the film holds an average score of 80 out of 100, based on 40 reviews.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/video/titles/hours|title=''The Hours''|publisher=Metacritic|accessdate=July 1, 2010}}</ref>\n\n[[Richard Schickel]] of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' criticized the film's simplistic characterization, saying, \"Watching ''The Hours'', one finds oneself focusing excessively on the unfortunate prosthetic nose Kidman affects in order to look more like the novelist. And wondering why the screenwriter, David Hare, and the director, Stephen Daldry, turn Woolf, a woman of incisive mind, into a hapless ditherer.\" He also criticized its overt politicization: \"But this movie is in love with female victimization. Moore's Laura is trapped in the suburban flatlands of the '50s, while Streep's Clarissa is moored in a hopeless love for Laura's homosexual son (Ed Harris, in a truly ugly performance), an AIDS sufferer whose relentless anger is directly traceable to Mom's long-ago desertion of him. Somehow, despite the complexity of the film's structure, this all seems too simple-minded. Or should we perhaps say agenda driven? This ultimately proves insufficient to lend meaning to their lives or profundity to a grim and uninvolving film, for which Philip Glass unwittingly provides the perfect score \u2014 tuneless, oppressive, droning, painfully self-important.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1003931,00.html|title=Holiday Movie Preview: The Hours|author=RICHARD SCHICKEL|date=December 23, 2002|accessdate=July 19, 2010|publisher=Time.com}}</ref>\n\n[[Stephen Holden]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' called the film \"deeply moving\" and \"an amazingly faithful screen adaptation\" and added, \"Although suicide eventually tempts three of the film's characters, ''The Hours'' is not an unduly morbid film. Clear eyed and austerely balanced would be a more accurate description, along with magnificently written and acted.

The result is something rare, especially considering how fine the novel is, a film that's fuller and deeper than the book ... It's marvelous to watch the ways in which [David Hare] consistently dramatizes the original material without compromising its integrity or distorting its intent ... Cunningham's [novel] touched on notes of longing, middle-aged angst and the sense of being a small consciousness in the midst of a grand mystery.

He praised the performances, commenting, \"Kidman's acting is superlative, full of passion and feeling ...

The performances that Daldry elicits . . . are all strong: tightly managed, smoothly and dashingly juxtaposed under a plangent score . . . Part of the bracing experimental impact of the film was the absence of narrative connection between the three women.
