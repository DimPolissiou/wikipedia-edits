Created by [[William J. Bell]], the role was introduced in 1990 \u2014 by [[Edward J. Scott]] \u2014 under the portrayal of [[Kimberlin Brown]], who portrayed the role for many intervals on both soaps until 2006. That same year, [[Michelle Stafford]] took over the role, after Sheila had plastic surgery to look like  [[Phyllis Summers]]. Brown returned to the role of Sheila on ''The Bold and the Beautiful'', beginning on June 9, 2017.\n\nSheila is known as a [[villain]]. A significant portion of Sheila's history on both soaps revolves around her long-running conflict with [[Lauren Fenmore]], whom she has attempted to kill on multiple occasions. She has also had conflicts with [[Stephanie Forrester (The Bold and the Beautiful)|Stephanie Forrester]], [[The Bold and the Beautiful secondary characters|Maggie Forrester]], [[Amber Moore]], [[Taylor Hayes (The Bold and the Beautiful)|Taylor Hayes]], [[Brooke Logan]], [[Phyllis Summers]], and [[Quinn Fuller]].\n\n==Casting and creation==\nThe role was portrayed by [[Kimberlin Brown]] for a total of 16 years.

There's nothing bitchy about what she does, [I mean] it's very straightforward. She's manipulative but never in a bitchy way, in a way to get things accomplished, and get things done the way she wants to.

So anyway, I shot Stephanie. I did. Stephanie felt she could be a better provider for my child than I could. And you know what, you don't keep a mother like Sheila away from her child, you just don't do that.

Sheila was a nurse who worked at Genoa City Memorial Hospital and immediately fell in love with the married [[Scott Grainger, Sr.|Dr. Scott Grainger]]. Her feelings for Scott quickly turned from infatuation to obsession. In order to steal him away from his wife [[Lauren Fenmore]], Sheila drugged him and had sex with him, resulting in a pregnancy. At the same time Lauren also became pregnant by Scott but didn't tell him. When the truth about the father of Sheila's baby came out, Scott felt obligated, so he thus divorced Lauren and married Sheila.\n\nSheila's baby died, unbeknownst to Scott, and she secretly switches Lauren's newborn with a [[black market]] baby, which Lauren named Dylan. Sheila began passing Lauren's baby off as her own, and Dylan eventually dies from [[meningitis]]. Sheila's mother, Molly Carter, found out about her daughter's crime and intended to tell Lauren the truth, but suffers a stroke that rendered her speechless. Sheila sent her mother to her farmhouse in Michigan before Molly could expose her. Lauren eventually found out about the baby switch, but not before Sheila kidnapped both Lauren and Molly, and almost succeeded in killing both women, when during a brief struggle Lauren accidentally kicked over a lantern on a coffee table, setting the farmhouse they were imprisoned in on fire. Lauren and Molly are rescued by Lauren's ex-husband, private investigator [[Paul Williams (The Young and the Restless)|Paul Williams]], and his secretary, [[Lynne Bassett]]. Sheila was never found, and authorities presumed that she perished in the fire when a body burned beyond recognition turned up in the ashes. The corpse turned out to be a meter man that had visited the house just before the fire started; Sheila had escaped from the burning building. Picking up a discarded newspaper in an area diner, she read about an opening working as a company nurse for the Forresters in [[Los Angeles]]. She left Wisconsin to travel to California. Meanwhile, Lauren is reunited with Scott and her real son, [[Scott Grainger, Jr.|Scott Jr.]]\n\n===1992\u20131998===\nIn 1992, Sheila is reintroduced on ''The Bold and the Beautiful'' and she quickly worms her way into fashion [[CEO]] [[Eric Forrester]] ([[John McCook]])'s life by becoming the company nurse at [[Forrester Creations]] in [[Los Angeles]], as well as working as [[Rick Forrester]]'s nanny (after staging an accident that leaves the former nanny, Judy, injured, and later threatening Judy and her family). Sheila and Eric fall in love and are eventually engaged, which angers Eric's ex-wife [[Stephanie Forrester (The Bold and the Beautiful)|Stephanie Forrester]] ([[Susan Flannery]]), who suspects Sheila is a [[wikt:gold digger|gold digger]] and a liar.  To Sheila's dismay, Eric's most recent ex-wife [[Brooke Logan Forrester]] ([[Katherine Kelly Lang]]) is pregnant with a child that may either belong to Eric or his son [[Ridge Forrester]] ([[Ronn Moss]]). After [[Bridget Forrester]] is born, Sheila manipulates the paternity test so that everyone will believe Ridge is the father. Security guard [[Mike Guthrie]] (Ken Hanes) catches her in the act and after threatening to blackmail her with the details, Sheila sets loose a vicious dog to attack him.\n\nMeanwhile, Lauren finds out that Sheila is alive and well, and living on the West Coast. Lauren follows her and they once again fight. Lauren threatens to expose Sheila to the Forrester family, but Sheila turns the tables on Lauren by [[blackmail]]ing her with pictures she took of Lauren sleeping with [[Brad Carlton]] ([[Don Diamont]]) and sent to Lauren as puzzle pieces.  Despite Sheila's love for Eric, she panics when Lauren attempts to disclose her past at the wedding, and leaves a heartbroken Eric at the altar.  After the guests leave, Sheila returns to the chapel and pleads for Eric's forgiveness.  Although Eric demands answers, he eventually forgives Sheila and the two are married. Sheila and Brooke become close friends.  Sheila and Eric's marriage becomes rocky when Sheila accepts a job from Brooke, who seizes control of Forrester Creations with her patent on the BeLieF formula.  Eric feels betrayed by her actions and a rift is created in their marriage.  Sheila proposes the two take a vacation and use this time to reconnect.  The two leave town for [[Santa Catalina Island, California|Catalina Island]].  Scott, who became ill, also vacations with Lauren in Catalina Island, where the two run into Eric and Sheila.  Lauren intends to use Scott to expose Sheila's past to Eric; however, Scott, still caring for Sheila, keeps mum.   Scott eventually dies on the island as a result of his illness.  With both women by his side, he wishes that Lauren give Sheila a second chance. Lauren tearfully agrees.\n\nWhen Sheila becomes concerned that Eric is excluding her from his will, she decides she would be more financially secure if she gave Eric a child.  After a [[one-night stand]] with former rival Connor Davis (Scott Thompson Baker), Sheila goes to Eric claiming she is pregnant with his child. Eric, who had recently had a [[vasectomy]], tells Sheila he wants a divorce. Brooke's fiance [[James Warwick (The Bold and the Beautiful)|Dr. James Warwick]] ([[Ian Buchanan]]) turns out to be a friend of Sheila's former [[psychiatrist]] Jay Garvin. James suspects Sheila is hiding something from the family, and tries to pry information from Dr. Garvin.  However, during a brief struggle, Sheila accidentally pushes Jay off a balcony and to his death.  James later learns from Lauren the secrets of her past. After attempting to drown Lauren in a hot tub, Sheila kidnaps James with the help of her new partner-in-crime, the security guard Mike. She imprisons him in the basement of her house (known as \"The Houdini House\") for some time. When James escapes and her secrets finally surface, she holds Stephanie, Eric, Ridge, Brooke, Lauren and James hostage in the Forrester mansion, welcoming them to her \"goodbye party.\"\n\nAt the \"party,\" Sheila tells everyone in attendance how they had personally wronged her, and threatens to kill them. Holding a gun to Stephanie, Sheila has a change of heart when the others step in front of her, and swallows a bottle of poison. Having survived, Sheila is placed in a [[psychiatric hospital]], under the care of Dr. Brian Carey ([[Kin Shriner]]), but does not remain there for long, despite Stephanie's attempts to keep her there. Sheila tries to revive her friendship with Brooke, who sides with her at first, but later wants nothing to do with her. She begins dating neighbor Grant Chambers ([[Charles Grant (actor)|Charles Grant]]), and later her psychiatrist, James Warwick.  She continues to see James at this time, and memories of her [[child abuse|abusive]] childhood are revealed.\n\nSheila meets [[The Bold and the Beautiful secondary characters|Maggie Forrester]] ([[Barbara Crampton]]), whom she befriends. The two are amazed to discover they both have ties to the same family. When Stephanie attempts to take Brooke's children, Sheila poisons her by replacing her medication with mercury pills until Stephanie losing her sanity and she is inpatient in a psychiatric hospital. Sheila also makes an enemy of Forrester Creations' rival, [[Sally Spectra]] ([[Darlene Conley]]) who defends Stephanie to her, thus planting the seeds of the eventual friendship between Stephanie and Sally. Ultimately Sheila frames Maggie for the poisoning of Stephanie, but later Maggie realizing who was behind the poisoning, fights with Sheila and accidentally pushes her onto a fire poker, seriously injuring her. After the fire poker incident, Sheila sets her sights on proving to James that she has changed for the better, in the hopes that he will fall in love with her. However, James has feelings for Maggie instead. Maggie goes to Sheila's house to inform her that she needs to find a new therapist, because Maggie wouldn't allow her to see James anymore. As Maggie taunts her, Sheila snaps and nearly chokes Maggie to death. Mike later kidnaps her and holds her prisoner at an amusement park. Sheila, wanting to prove to James that she had changed, agrees to release Maggie.\n\nAfter having crashed James and Maggie's wedding, Sheila reveals that she has become pregnant after a night alone with James. The three come to a [[legal settlement|settlement]] that Sheila would temporarily stay with them until her baby was born, and the child would be given to James and Maggie.  After Sheila hands her baby, Mary, over to the Warwicks, she relocates to [[Death Valley]], where she meets [[Amber Moore]] ([[Adrienne Frantz]]). Anxious to see her daughter, Sheila suggests that Amber babysit for James and Maggie, so that she can secretly visit Mary in LA. Amber is hired and keeps her alliance with Sheila secret for some time, but when Sheila threatens her, she reveals to James and Maggie the real reason why she applied to be Mary's babysitter. Sheila eventually takes matters into her own hands and takes Mary back. James attempts to trick Sheila into marrying him, so that he can gain full custody of his daughter. When Sheila realizes the marriage is a set-up, she attempts to kill herself again by jumping off a roof.  James, who had actually fallen for Sheila during this time, promises to stay with her. Meanwhile, an angry Maggie sneaks into Sheila's hospital room and cuts off her [[oxygen]]. Sheila is rescued by doctors and Maggie is immediately arrested. With the help of Mike and his brother Martin, a desperate Maggie captures Sheila and holds her prisoner, appropriately, in the house from ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' at [[Universal Studios Hollywood]].  When Sheila escapes, James demands that Maggie leave.  Maggie and Lauren later team up in an attempt to drive Sheila over the edge. They wire Sheila's house with hidden cameras and an audio system, while the former nanny Judy surprises Sheila on her doorstep.  The plan fails, however, and Maggie, realizing James and the baby are lost to her, leaves town. When a friendship begins between James and Stephanie, a [[paranoia|paranoid]] Sheila becomes jealous and attempts to drown Stephanie in a pool.  To prevent Stephanie from telling anyone about this incident, Sheila threatens to kill Stephanie's grandson, [[Thomas Forrester]].  Sheila is arrested for the threat, but secretly switches places with a woman named Sybil.  After breaking out of prison in disguise, Sheila shoots Stephanie, kidnaps baby Mary and leaves town.\n\n===2002\u20132003===\nSheila returns to Los Angeles four years later to find her now-teenage daughter [[Erica Lovejoy|Mary]] (whom she had renamed Erica Lovejoy) ([[Courtnee Draper]]). Erica, who is completely unaware of her mother's past or her own real name, has traveled to L.A. to meet her idol - Amber Forrester. She soon develops a crush on Amber's husband, [[Rick Forrester]], although she never intends to act on her feelings. Sheila convinces Erica to seduce Rick, saying that a Forrester man would never abandon the woman carrying his child. She then pays off a man named Lance to drug Amber and take her to bed.  Amber tracks Lance down and begins to question him. When a nervous Lance threatens to tell Amber everything, Sheila kills him by releasing a jar of [[bee]]s into his apartment.  Amber becomes increasingly suspicious and confronts Erica in Rick's office. During a struggle, Erica falls and hits her head on a desk, making Amber look guilty of pushing her.  At the hospital, a disguised Sheila confronts Amber, warning her to stay away from her daughter.  Amber decides to look for clues at Erica's apartment, but is impeded when Sheila throws a pot at the window and the police arrive, arresting Amber and causing the Forresters to distrust her further.  Meanwhile, while browsing through a photo album of Eric's, Erica is startled to find a picture of her mother.  She learns that Sheila was formerly married to Eric, and that her mother wants her to live the life she had always dreamed of with Rick.  Sheila pushes Erica to have sex with Rick, so that she can live vicariously as a Forrester through her daughter.\n    \nAs a reluctant Erica is about to carry out her mother's plan, Rick's brother Ridge bursts in and exposes Erica's true identity. Rick kicks Erica out, but not before Sheila kidnaps Amber, who is stunned to learn that Erica is really Mary Warwick.  Sheila stages a crime scene and drags Amber off to her apartment. [[Massimo Marone]] ([[Joseph Mascolo]]), who had been romantically involved with Sheila for a short time, gets a call from her, and Stephanie recognizes her voice.  The two track Sheila and Amber down.  Sheila then flees and holds Eric and [[Taylor Hayes Forrester]] ([[Hunter Tylo]]) hostage at the mansion. But when Brooke walks into the room, a struggle ensues in which Taylor and Brooke are shot. Brooke survives her wounds, whereas Taylor succumbs (a few years later, Taylor was revealed to still be alive). Sheila is arrested and subsequently confronted by her daughter, who condemns Sheila's actions and wants nothing to do with her. Sheila is jailed for her crimes but soon escapes with the help of a sympathetic warden named Sugar ([[Robin Mattson]]).   \n   \nShe then kidnaps Ridge and Brooke, while on their [[South American]] [[honeymoon]]. Soon Ridge's half-brother [[Nick Marone]] ([[Jack Wagner (actor)|Jack Wagner]]) arrives to rescue Ridge but he is soon captured by Sheila as well. When Ridge and Nick's father, Massimo, arrives to deliver the ransom, Sheila reveals that she had a baby daughter, Diana, whom she claims to be the result of the fling she had with Massimo during her previous trip to L.A. When Massimo tries (unsuccessfully) to trick Sheila into handing over the infant, she and Sugar run away. Brooke and Nick are soon rescued; however, it is believed that Ridge had been burned to death in the foundry Sheila stashed him in. Soon after, it is revealed that Ridge had survived, and he reunites with Brooke on the island.\n\n===2005\u20132007===\nSheila returns to Genoa City (on ''The Young and the Restless'') after being unseen for ten years, and begins terrorizing Lauren once again, by indirectly turning her now-adult son Scott ([[Blair Redford]]) against her, under the alias Brenda Harris. It is soon revealed that the woman in the psychiatric hospital who was believed to be Sheila is actually Sugar - Sheila drugged and tricked her into having plastic surgery in order to look just like Sheila, and then turned Sugar in to the police. Meanwhile, the real Sheila develops another persona, Jennifer Mitchell, by wearing a fake nose, wig, and speaking in a British accent. She allies with [[The Young and the Restless characters (2000s)#Tom Fisher|Tom Fisher]] ([[Roscoe Born]]), who helps her in her scheme to poison Lauren with a necklace that Scott offers to his mother as a gift. In exchange, Tom has Sheila manipulate his estranged wife [[Gloria Abbott Bardwell|Gloria Abbott]] ([[Judith Chapman]]) into giving him money and later bailing him out of prison.\n\nWhen Lauren plans a rooftop dinner with her fianc\u00e9 [[Michael Baldwin]] ([[Christian LeBlanc]]), Sheila surprises her and persuades her to commit suicide by jumping off of the roof. Lauren believes Sheila is a hallucination, but before she can jump, Michael rescues her. At the hospital, Sheila sneaks into Lauren's room as \"Jennifer,\" and attempts to inject the poison into Lauren's bloodstream, but is interrupted. She then convinces Tom \u2014 Michael's stepfather \u2014 to help her abduct Lauren from a yacht while on her honeymoon with Michael. She then bombs the yacht, hoping to kill both Lauren and Tom, whom she wants to take the fall for the crime.  Tom realizes Sheila's plan, and traps both Sheila and Lauren in a bomb shelter.  Tom leaves the two together and in the meantime is shot and killed by [[John Abbott (The Young and the Restless)|John Abbott]] ([[Jerry Douglas]]). As the bomb shelter collapses, Lauren is astonished when Sheila saves her life.  Meanwhile, Sugar manages to leave the psychiatric hospital, and goes to see Scott, who believes she is Sheila. Sugar then proceeds to stab him in order to exact her revenge on Sheila. Sugar is arrested; upon seeing her, Lauren immediately knows it is not Sheila whose ankle is sprained.  The real Sheila is seen in a plastic surgeon's office, asking for a new face.\n\nMonths later: it is revealed that Sheila Carter is still alive, had plastic surgery to look like [[Phyllis Summers Newman]] ([[Michelle Stafford]]), and that Paul Williams had been hiding the fact that he had been keeping her locked in a cage she had constructed in an abandoned warehouse. Ultimately, Sheila is determined to escape and take Phyllis's place in order to infiltrate Michael and Lauren's lives. Sheila is accidentally freed from the prison she created for Lauren by Maggie Sullivan, Paul's girlfriend. After acting as a kidnap victim and pleading for Maggie's help, Maggie sets her free but Sheila chokes her unconscious, steals her gun, and then shoots her, but Maggie survives.\n\nSubsequently, Paul returns to the warehouse only to be ambushed by Sheila who imprisons both Paul and Maggie in that cage. Sheila then went to Phyllis', tied her up and waited for Lauren and baby Fen to arrive while taunting Phyllis about how great it would be to take over her life with her husband [[Nicholas Newman]] ([[Joshua Morrow]]) and her baby Summer. After Lauren arrived she was tied up, and Sheila flees with Phyllis and babies Fen and Summer as hostages. By this time, Michael arrives at the warehouse and frees Paul and Maggie, the latter being taken to the hospital.\n\nPosing as an elderly woman named Betsy, Sheila takes Phyllis, Summer, and Fen to a nearby retirement home to hide out. After learning of their location, Lauren goes to that home carrying a gun in her purse. Following a tip from a neighbor, Lauren finds Sheila's apartment and forces her way inside. Sheila and Phyllis then argue over who is who, and Lauren screams at them to stop. Sheila then runs to grab baby Summer in order to use her as a shield against Lauren; Phyllis tells Lauren to point the gun at her to protect her daughter, and a frightened Lauren, realizing the real Phyllis would never put her daughter in the line of fire, turns to Sheila and shoots her. Sheila is then declared dead at the scene.\n\n===2010, 2012===\nIn 2010, Sarah Smythe, Sheila Carter's sister, arrives in Genoa City. Having herself had plastic surgery to resemble Lauren ([[Tracey E. Bregman]]), Sarah holds both Phyllis and Lauren responsible for her sister's death. Sarah devises a plan with [[Daisy Carter]] and [[Ryder Callahan]], Sheila's twins with Tom Fisher, to take over Lauren's life and riches. The plan fails, with Lauren shooting and killing Sarah in self-defense to Sarah's attempt to fire her gun at Phyllis. In 2012, a woman claiming to be Daisy's mother checks her out of a mental institution, signing the name \"Sheila Carter\" on the release form. Michael has said signature analyzed to see if it fits Sheila's handwriting, and results turn out to be inconclusive.\n\n===2017\u20132018===\nSheila (Brown) returns to Los Angeles in June 2017. When she attempts to leave [[Katie Logan]] ([[Heather Tom]])'s home without being noticed, [[Quinn Fuller|Quinn Forrester]] ([[Rena Sofer]]) hears her leaving, immediately asking who she is. Introducing herself as a friend of the [[Logan family]], Sheila reveals herself to Katie, asking for her assistance in making amends with those she had wronged in Los Angeles. Startled by her arrival, Katie immediately alerts Eric of Sheila's re-appearance; arriving at Katie's and believing that Sheila is the one who shot at Quinn, Eric escorts Sheila to the police station, and has her arrested for violating an order of protection he had previously filed years prior.  When it is revealed that [[Deacon Sharpe]] ([[Sean Kanan]]) is the one who was targeting Quinn, Eric extends an olive branch to Sheila, welcoming her back to the Forrester estate, much to the disapproval of Quinn and Ridge ([[Thorsten Kaye]]). Sheila immediately begins to dig into the life of Eric, rooting herself into his marriage with Quinn. After scheming with Forrester security officer, Charlie Webber, Sheila exposes Quinn's affair with Ridge.  As Sheila comforts and supports an emotionally hurt Eric, she is confronted by [[Steffy Forrester]] ([[Jacqueline MacInnes Wood]]), who \u2014 believing Sheila to be armed \u2014 shoots her in Eric's hotel room, but she survives, only sustaining a flesh wound.  Sheila continues to insinuate herself into Eric's life, faking a concussion after a catfight with Quinn to manipulate Eric into letting her stay in the Forrester mansion.  Sheila blackmails her ex-husband, James Warwick, into lying about the severity of her condition, but slips up when Quinn catches her walking around normally.  Sheila gets a waitressing job in town to eavesdrop on the residents of Los Angeles, and later offers Eric's estate manager Mateo money to seduce Quinn, but her plan is foiled when Mateo tells Quinn the truth.  Sheila is thrilled when Eric invites her to the Forrester mansion with the intention of replacing Quinn's portrait with Sheila's, but this turns out to be a ruse.  As Eric and Quinn again demand that Sheila leave, Sheila smiles to herself outside the closed mansion door.\n\n==Critical reception==\nSheila is often considered to be one of the most popular villains in daytime.<ref name=\"Soap opera slimeballs: The best villains\">{{cite web|url=http://www.hlntv.com/slideshow/2013/06/15/soap-opera-villains-bad-guys-daytime-emmys |title=Soap opera slimeballs: The best villains|website=www.hlntv.com |accessdate=25 August 2014}}</ref> Kimberlin Brown was nominated for a Daytime Emmy in the role as Outstanding Supporting Actress in 1993.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.soapcentral.com/yr/whoswho/sheila.php Sheila Carter biography] at SoapCentral\n\n{{The Young and the Restless}}\n{{The Bold and the Beautiful}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Carter, Sheila}}\n[[Category:The Young and the Restless characters]]\n[[Category:The Bold and the Beautiful characters]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters from Michigan]]\n[[Category:Television characters introduced in 1990]]\n[[Category:Fictional murderers]]\n[[Category:Fictional nurses]]\n[[Category:Fictional rapists]]\n[[Category:Fictional criminals on soap operas]]\n[[Category:Female characters in television]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox soap character\n| name = Sheila Carter<!--The title of the page should be left here-->\n| series = The Young and the Restless\n| image = File:Kimberlin Brown as Sheila Carter.png\n| caption = Kimberlin Brown as Sheila Carter\n| image2 =File:Pheila.jpg\n| imagesize2=200px\n| caption2 = Michelle Stafford as Sheila Carter\n| portrayer = {{Plainlist |\n* [[Kimberlin Brown]] (1990\u20132006, 2017\u2013present)\n* [[Michelle Stafford]] (2006\u20132007)\n}}\n| creator = [[William J.

Created by [[William J. Bell]], the role was introduced in 1990 \u2014 by [[Edward J. Scott]] \u2014 under the portrayal of [[Kimberlin Brown]], who portrayed the role for many intervals on both soaps until 2006. That same year, [[Michelle Stafford]] took over the role, after Sheila had plastic surgery to look like  [[Phyllis Summers]]. Brown returned to the role of Sheila on ''The Bold and the Beautiful'', beginning on June 9, 2017.\n\nSheila is known as a [[villain]]. A significant portion of Sheila's history on both soaps revolves around her long-running conflict with [[Lauren Fenmore]], whom she has attempted to kill on multiple occasions. She has also had conflicts with [[Stephanie Forrester (The Bold and the Beautiful)|Stephanie Forrester]], [[The Bold and the Beautiful secondary characters|Maggie Forrester]], [[Amber Moore]], [[Taylor Hayes (The Bold and the Beautiful)|Taylor Hayes]], [[Brooke Logan]], [[Phyllis Summers]], and [[Quinn Fuller]].\n\n==Casting and creation==\nThe role was portrayed by [[Kimberlin Brown]] for a total of 16 years.

There's nothing bitchy about what she does, [I mean] it's very straightforward. She's manipulative but never in a bitchy way, in a way to get things accomplished, and get things done the way she wants to.

So anyway, I shot Stephanie. I did. Stephanie felt she could be a better provider for my child than I could. And you know what, you don't keep a mother like Sheila away from her child, you just don't do that.

Sheila was a nurse who worked at Genoa City Memorial Hospital and immediately fell in love with the married [[Scott Grainger, Sr.|Dr. Scott Grainger]]. Her feelings for Scott quickly turned from infatuation to obsession. In order to steal him away from his wife [[Lauren Fenmore]], Sheila drugged him and had sex with him, resulting in a pregnancy. At the same time Lauren also became pregnant by Scott but didn't tell him. When the truth about the father of Sheila's baby came out, Scott felt obligated, so he thus divorced Lauren and married Sheila.\n\nSheila's baby died, unbeknownst to Scott, and she secretly switches Lauren's newborn with a [[black market]] baby, which Lauren named Dylan. Sheila began passing Lauren's baby off as her own, and Dylan eventually dies from [[meningitis]]. Sheila's mother, Molly Carter, found out about her daughter's crime and intended to tell Lauren the truth, but suffers a stroke that rendered her speechless. Sheila sent her mother to her farmhouse in Michigan before Molly could expose her. Lauren eventually found out about the baby switch, but not before Sheila kidnapped both Lauren and Molly, and almost succeeded in killing both women, when during a brief struggle Lauren accidentally kicked over a lantern on a coffee table, setting the farmhouse they were imprisoned in on fire. Lauren and Molly are rescued by Lauren's ex-husband, private investigator [[Paul Williams (The Young and the Restless)|Paul Williams]], and his secretary, [[Lynne Bassett]]. Sheila was never found, and authorities presumed that she perished in the fire when a body burned beyond recognition turned up in the ashes. The corpse turned out to be a meter man that had visited the house just before the fire started; Sheila had escaped from the burning building. Picking up a discarded newspaper in an area diner, she read about an opening working as a company nurse for the Forresters in [[Los Angeles]]. She left Wisconsin to travel to California. Meanwhile, Lauren is reunited with Scott and her real son, [[Scott Grainger, Jr.|Scott Jr.]]\n\n===1992\u201398===\nIn 1992, Sheila is reintroduced on ''The Bold and the Beautiful'' and she quickly worms her way into fashion [[CEO]] [[Eric Forrester]] ([[John McCook]])'s life by becoming the company nurse at [[Forrester Creations]] in [[Los Angeles]], as well as working as [[Rick Forrester]]'s nanny (after staging an accident that leaves the former nanny, Judy, injured, and later threatening Judy and her family). Sheila and Eric fall in love and are eventually engaged, which angers Eric's ex-wife [[Stephanie Forrester (The Bold and the Beautiful)|Stephanie Forrester]] ([[Susan Flannery]]), who suspects Sheila is a [[wikt:gold digger|gold digger]] and a liar.  To Sheila's dismay, Eric's most recent ex-wife [[Brooke Logan Forrester]] ([[Katherine Kelly Lang]]) is pregnant with a child that may either belong to Eric or his son [[Ridge Forrester]] ([[Ronn Moss]]). After [[Bridget Forrester]] is born, Sheila manipulates the paternity test so that everyone will believe Ridge is the father. Security guard [[Mike Guthrie]] (Ken Hanes) catches her in the act and after threatening to blackmail her with the details, Sheila sets loose a vicious dog to attack him.\n\nMeanwhile, Lauren finds out that Sheila is alive and well, and living on the West Coast. Lauren follows her and they once again fight. Lauren threatens to expose Sheila to the Forrester family, but Sheila turns the tables on Lauren by [[blackmail]]ing her with pictures she took of Lauren sleeping with [[Brad Carlton]] ([[Don Diamont]]) and sent to Lauren as puzzle pieces.  Despite Sheila's love for Eric, she panics when Lauren attempts to disclose her past at the wedding, and leaves a heartbroken Eric at the altar.  After the guests leave, Sheila returns to the chapel and pleads for Eric's forgiveness.  Although Eric demands answers, he eventually forgives Sheila and the two are married. Sheila and Brooke become close friends.  Sheila and Eric's marriage becomes rocky when Sheila accepts a job from Brooke, who seizes control of Forrester Creations with her patent on the BeLieF formula.  Eric feels betrayed by her actions and a rift is created in their marriage.  Sheila proposes the two take a vacation and use this time to reconnect.  The two leave town for [[Santa Catalina Island, California|Catalina Island]].  Scott, who became ill, also vacations with Lauren in Catalina Island, where the two run into Eric and Sheila.  Lauren intends to use Scott to expose Sheila's past to Eric; however, Scott, still caring for Sheila, keeps mum.   Scott eventually dies on the island as a result of his illness.  With both women by his side, he wishes that Lauren give Sheila a second chance. Lauren tearfully agrees.\n\nWhen Sheila becomes concerned that Eric is excluding her from his will, she decides she would be more financially secure if she gave Eric a child.  After a [[one-night stand]] with former rival Connor Davis (Scott Thompson Baker), Sheila goes to Eric claiming she is pregnant with his child. Eric, who had recently had a [[vasectomy]], tells Sheila he wants a divorce. Brooke's fiance [[James Warwick (The Bold and the Beautiful)|Dr. James Warwick]] ([[Ian Buchanan]]) turns out to be a friend of Sheila's former [[psychiatrist]] Jay Garvin. James suspects Sheila is hiding something from the family, and tries to pry information from Dr. Garvin.  However, during a brief struggle, Sheila accidentally pushes Jay off a balcony and to his death.  James later learns from Lauren the secrets of her past. After attempting to drown Lauren in a hot tub, Sheila kidnaps James with the help of her new partner-in-crime, the security guard Mike. She imprisons him in the basement of her house (known as \"The Houdini House\") for some time. When James escapes and her secrets finally surface, she holds Stephanie, Eric, Ridge, Brooke, Lauren and James hostage in the Forrester mansion, welcoming them to her \"goodbye party.\"\n\nAt the \"party,\" Sheila tells everyone in attendance how they had personally wronged her, and threatens to kill them. Holding a gun to Stephanie, Sheila has a change of heart when the others step in front of her, and swallows a bottle of poison. Having survived, Sheila is placed in a [[psychiatric hospital]], under the care of Dr. Brian Carey ([[Kin Shriner]]), but does not remain there for long, despite Stephanie's attempts to keep her there. Sheila tries to revive her friendship with Brooke, who sides with her at first, but later wants nothing to do with her. She begins dating neighbor Grant Chambers ([[Charles Grant (actor)|Charles Grant]]), and later her psychiatrist, James Warwick.  She continues to see James at this time, and memories of her [[child abuse|abusive]] childhood are revealed.\n\nSheila meets [[The Bold and the Beautiful secondary characters|Maggie Forrester]] ([[Barbara Crampton]]), whom she befriends. The two are amazed to discover they both have ties to the same family. When Stephanie attempts to take Brooke's children, Sheila poisons her by replacing her medication with mercury pills until Stephanie losing her sanity and she is inpatient in a psychiatric hospital. Sheila also makes an enemy of Forrester Creations' rival, [[Sally Spectra]] ([[Darlene Conley]]) who defends Stephanie to her, thus planting the seeds of the eventual friendship between Stephanie and Sally. Ultimately Sheila frames Maggie for the poisoning of Stephanie, but later Maggie realizing who was behind the poisoning, fights with Sheila and accidentally pushes her onto a fire poker, seriously injuring her. After the fire poker incident, Sheila sets her sights on proving to James that she has changed for the better, in the hopes that he will fall in love with her. However, James has feelings for Maggie instead. Maggie goes to Sheila's house to inform her that she needs to find a new therapist, because Maggie wouldn't allow her to see James anymore. As Maggie taunts her, Sheila snaps and nearly chokes Maggie to death. Mike later kidnaps her and holds her prisoner at an amusement park. Sheila, wanting to prove to James that she had changed, agrees to release Maggie.\n\nAfter having crashed James and Maggie's wedding, Sheila reveals that she has become pregnant after a night alone with James. The three come to a [[legal settlement|settlement]] that Sheila would temporarily stay with them until her baby was born, and the child would be given to James and Maggie.  After Sheila hands her baby, Mary, over to the Warwicks, she relocates to [[Death Valley]], where she meets [[Amber Moore]] ([[Adrienne Frantz]]). Anxious to see her daughter, Sheila suggests that Amber babysit for James and Maggie, so that she can secretly visit Mary in LA. Amber is hired and keeps her alliance with Sheila secret for some time, but when Sheila threatens her, she reveals to James and Maggie the real reason why she applied to be Mary's babysitter. Sheila eventually takes matters into her own hands and takes Mary back. James attempts to trick Sheila into marrying him, so that he can gain full custody of his daughter. When Sheila realizes the marriage is a set-up, she attempts to kill herself again by jumping off a roof.  James, who had actually fallen for Sheila during this time, promises to stay with her. Meanwhile, an angry Maggie sneaks into Sheila's hospital room and cuts off her [[oxygen]]. Sheila is rescued by doctors and Maggie is immediately arrested. With the help of Mike and his brother Martin, a desperate Maggie captures Sheila and holds her prisoner, appropriately, in the house from ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' at [[Universal Studios Hollywood]].  When Sheila escapes, James demands that Maggie leave.  Maggie and Lauren later team up in an attempt to drive Sheila over the edge. They wire Sheila's house with hidden cameras and an audio system, while the former nanny Judy surprises Sheila on her doorstep.  The plan fails, however, and Maggie, realizing James and the baby are lost to her, leaves town. When a friendship begins between James and Stephanie, a [[paranoia|paranoid]] Sheila becomes jealous and attempts to drown Stephanie in a pool.  To prevent Stephanie from telling anyone about this incident, Sheila threatens to kill Stephanie's grandson, [[Thomas Forrester]].  Sheila is arrested for the threat, but secretly switches places with a woman named Sybil.  After breaking out of prison in disguise, Sheila shoots Stephanie, kidnaps baby Mary and leaves town.\n\n===2002\u20132003===\nSheila returns to Los Angeles four years later to find her now-teenage daughter [[Erica Lovejoy|Mary]] (whom she had renamed Erica Lovejoy) ([[Courtnee Draper]]). Erica, who is completely unaware of her mother's past or her own real name, has traveled to L.A. to meet her idol - Amber Forrester. She soon develops a crush on Amber's husband, [[Rick Forrester]], although she never intends to act on her feelings. Sheila convinces Erica to seduce Rick, saying that a Forrester man would never abandon the woman carrying his child. She then pays off a man named Lance to drug Amber and take her to bed.  Amber tracks Lance down and begins to question him. When a nervous Lance threatens to tell Amber everything, Sheila kills him by releasing a jar of [[bee]]s into his apartment.  Amber becomes increasingly suspicious and confronts Erica in Rick's office. During a struggle, Erica falls and hits her head on a desk, making Amber look guilty of pushing her.  At the hospital, a disguised Sheila confronts Amber, warning her to stay away from her daughter.  Amber decides to look for clues at Erica's apartment, but is impeded when Sheila throws a pot at the window and the police arrive, arresting Amber and causing the Forresters to distrust her further.  Meanwhile, while browsing through a photo album of Eric's, Erica is startled to find a picture of her mother.  She learns that Sheila was formerly married to Eric, and that her mother wants her to live the life she had always dreamed of with Rick.  Sheila pushes Erica to have sex with Rick, so that she can live vicariously as a Forrester through her daughter.\n    \nAs a reluctant Erica is about to carry out her mother's plan, Rick's brother Ridge bursts in and exposes Erica's true identity. Rick kicks Erica out, but not before Sheila kidnaps Amber, who is stunned to learn that Erica is really Mary Warwick.  Sheila stages a crime scene and drags Amber off to her apartment. [[Massimo Marone]] ([[Joseph Mascolo]]), who had been romantically involved with Sheila for a short time, gets a call from her, and Stephanie recognizes her voice.  The two track Sheila and Amber down.  Sheila then flees and holds Eric and [[Taylor Hayes Forrester]] ([[Hunter Tylo]]) hostage at the mansion. But when Brooke walks into the room, a struggle ensues in which Taylor and Brooke are shot. Brooke survives her wounds, whereas Taylor succumbs (a few years later, Taylor was revealed to still be alive). Sheila is arrested and subsequently confronted by her daughter, who condemns Sheila's actions and wants nothing to do with her. Sheila is jailed for her crimes but soon escapes with the help of a sympathetic warden named Sugar ([[Robin Mattson]]).   \n   \nShe then kidnaps Ridge and Brooke, while on their [[South American]] [[honeymoon]]. Soon Ridge's half-brother [[Nick Marone]] ([[Jack Wagner (actor)|Jack Wagner]]) arrives to rescue Ridge but he is soon captured by Sheila as well. When Ridge and Nick's father, Massimo, arrives to deliver the ransom, Sheila reveals that she had a baby daughter, Diana, whom she claims to be the result of the fling she had with Massimo during her previous trip to L.A. When Massimo tries (unsuccessfully) to trick Sheila into handing over the infant, she and Sugar run away. Brooke and Nick are soon rescued; however, it is believed that Ridge had been burned to death in the foundry Sheila stashed him in. Soon after, it is revealed that Ridge had survived, and he reunites with Brooke on the island.\n\n===2005\u20132007===\nSheila returns to Genoa City (on ''The Young and the Restless'') after being unseen for ten years, and begins terrorizing Lauren once again, by indirectly turning her now-adult son Scott ([[Blair Redford]]) against her, under the alias Brenda Harris. It is soon revealed that the woman in the psychiatric hospital who was believed to be Sheila is actually Sugar - Sheila drugged and tricked her into having plastic surgery in order to look just like Sheila, and then turned Sugar in to the police. Meanwhile, the real Sheila develops another persona, Jennifer Mitchell, by wearing a fake nose, wig, and speaking in a British accent. She allies with [[The Young and the Restless characters (2000s)#Tom Fisher|Tom Fisher]] ([[Roscoe Born]]), who helps her in her scheme to poison Lauren with a necklace that Scott offers to his mother as a gift. In exchange, Tom has Sheila manipulate his estranged wife [[Gloria Abbott Bardwell|Gloria Abbott]] ([[Judith Chapman]]) into giving him money and later bailing him out of prison.\n\nWhen Lauren plans a rooftop dinner with her fianc\u00e9 [[Michael Baldwin]] ([[Christian LeBlanc]]), Sheila surprises her and persuades her to commit suicide by jumping off of the roof. Lauren believes Sheila is a hallucination, but before she can jump, Michael rescues her. At the hospital, Sheila sneaks into Lauren's room as \"Jennifer,\" and attempts to inject the poison into Lauren's bloodstream, but is interrupted. She then convinces Tom \u2014 Michael's stepfather \u2014 to help her abduct Lauren from a yacht while on her honeymoon with Michael. She then bombs the yacht, hoping to kill both Lauren and Tom, whom she wants to take the fall for the crime.  Tom realizes Sheila's plan, and traps both Sheila and Lauren in a bomb shelter.  Tom leaves the two together and in the meantime is shot and killed by [[John Abbott (The Young and the Restless)|John Abbott]] ([[Jerry Douglas]]). As the bomb shelter collapses, Lauren is astonished when Sheila saves her life.  Meanwhile, Sugar manages to leave the psychiatric hospital, and goes to see Scott, who believes she is Sheila. Sugar then proceeds to stab him in order to exact her revenge on Sheila. Sugar is arrested; upon seeing her, Lauren immediately knows it is not Sheila whose ankle is sprained.  The real Sheila is seen in a plastic surgeon's office, asking for a new face.\n\nMonths later: it is revealed that Sheila Carter is still alive, had plastic surgery to look like [[Phyllis Summers Newman]] ([[Michelle Stafford]]), and that Paul Williams had been hiding the fact that he had been keeping her locked in a cage she had constructed in an abandoned warehouse. Ultimately, Sheila is determined to escape and take Phyllis's place in order to infiltrate Michael and Lauren's lives. Sheila is accidentally freed from the prison she created for Lauren by Maggie Sullivan, Paul's girlfriend. After acting as a kidnap victim and pleading for Maggie's help, Maggie sets her free but Sheila chokes her unconscious, steals her gun, and then shoots her, but Maggie survives.\n\nSubsequently, Paul returns to the warehouse only to be ambushed by Sheila who imprisons both Paul and Maggie in that cage. Sheila then went to Phyllis', tied her up and waited for Lauren and baby Fen to arrive while taunting Phyllis about how great it would be to take over her life with her husband [[Nicholas Newman]] ([[Joshua Morrow]]) and her baby Summer. After Lauren arrived she was tied up, and Sheila flees with Phyllis and babies Fen and Summer as hostages. By this time, Michael arrives at the warehouse and frees Paul and Maggie, the latter being taken to the hospital.\n\nPosing as an elderly woman named Betsy, Sheila takes Phyllis, Summer, and Fen to a nearby retirement home to hide out. After learning of their location, Lauren goes to that home carrying a gun in her purse. Following a tip from a neighbor, Lauren finds Sheila's apartment and forces her way inside. Sheila and Phyllis then argue over who is who, and Lauren screams at them to stop. Sheila then runs to grab baby Summer in order to use her as a shield against Lauren; Phyllis tells Lauren to point the gun at her to protect her daughter, and a frightened Lauren, realizing the real Phyllis would never put her daughter in the line of fire, turns to Sheila and shoots her. Sheila is then declared dead at the scene.\n\n===2010, 2012===\nIn 2010, Sarah Smythe, Sheila Carter's sister, arrives in Genoa City. Having herself had plastic surgery to resemble Lauren ([[Tracey E. Bregman]]), Sarah holds both Phyllis and Lauren responsible for her sister's death. Sarah devises a plan with [[Daisy Carter]] and [[Ryder Callahan]], Sheila's twins with Tom Fisher, to take over Lauren's life and riches. The plan fails, with Lauren shooting and killing Sarah in self-defense to Sarah's attempt to fire her gun at Phyllis. In 2012, a woman claiming to be Daisy's mother checks her out of a mental institution, signing the name \"Sheila Carter\" on the release form. Michael has said signature analyzed to see if it fits Sheila's handwriting, and results turn out to be inconclusive.\n\n===2017\u20132018===\nSheila (Brown) returns to Los Angeles in June 2017. When she attempts to leave [[Katie Logan]] ([[Heather Tom]])'s home without being noticed, [[Quinn Fuller|Quinn Forrester]] ([[Rena Sofer]]) hears her leaving, immediately asking who she is. Introducing herself as a friend of the [[Logan family]], Sheila reveals herself to Katie, asking for her assistance in making amends with those she had wronged in Los Angeles. Startled by her arrival, Katie immediately alerts Eric of Sheila's re-appearance; arriving at Katie's and believing that Sheila is the one who shot at Quinn, Eric escorts Sheila to the police station, and has her arrested for violating an order of protection he had previously filed years prior.  When it is revealed that [[Deacon Sharpe]] ([[Sean Kanan]]) is the one who was targeting Quinn, Eric extends an olive branch to Sheila, welcoming her back to the Forrester estate, much to the disapproval of Quinn and Ridge ([[Thorsten Kaye]]). Sheila immediately begins to dig into the life of Eric, rooting herself into his marriage with Quinn. After scheming with Forrester security officer, Charlie Webber, Sheila exposes Quinn's affair with Ridge.  As Sheila comforts and supports an emotionally hurt Eric, she is confronted by [[Steffy Forrester]] ([[Jacqueline MacInnes Wood]]), who \u2014 believing Sheila to be armed \u2014 shoots her in Eric's hotel room, but she survives, only sustaining a flesh wound.  Sheila continues to insinuate herself into Eric's life, faking a concussion after a catfight with Quinn to manipulate Eric into letting her stay in the Forrester mansion.  Sheila blackmails her ex-husband, James Warwick, into lying about the severity of her condition, but slips up when Quinn catches her walking around normally.  Sheila gets a waitressing job in town to eavesdrop on the residents of Los Angeles, and later offers Eric's estate manager Mateo money to seduce Quinn, but her plan is foiled when Mateo tells Quinn the truth.  Sheila is thrilled when Eric invites her to the Forrester mansion with the intention of replacing Quinn's portrait with Sheila's, but this turns out to be a ruse.  As Eric and Quinn again demand that Sheila leave, Sheila smiles to herself outside the closed mansion door.\n\n==Critical reception==\nSheila is often considered to be one of the most popular villains in daytime.<ref name=\"Soap opera slimeballs: The best villains\">{{cite web|url=http://www.hlntv.com/slideshow/2013/06/15/soap-opera-villains-bad-guys-daytime-emmys |title=Soap opera slimeballs: The best villains|website=www.hlntv.com |accessdate=25 August 2014}}</ref> Kimberlin Brown was nominated for a Daytime Emmy in the role as Outstanding Supporting Actress in 1993.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.soapcentral.com/yr/whoswho/sheila.php Sheila Carter biography] at SoapCentral\n\n{{The Young and the Restless}}\n{{The Bold and the Beautiful}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Carter, Sheila}}\n[[Category:The Young and the Restless characters]]\n[[Category:The Bold and the Beautiful characters]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters from Michigan]]\n[[Category:Television characters introduced in 1990]]\n[[Category:Fictional murderers]]\n[[Category:Fictional nurses]]\n[[Category:Fictional rapists]]\n[[Category:Fictional criminals on soap operas]]\n[[Category:Female characters in television]]\n", "name_user": "Moe1810", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200e1992\u201398", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheila_Carter"}

The theory that light waves can be acted upon the same way as radio waves is now a popular idea among scientists. The agent can be compared to a stone in a river, around which water passes, but slightly down-stream leaves no trace of the stone. Comparing light waves to the water, and whatever object that is being \"cloaked\" to the stone, the goal is to have light waves pass around that object, leaving no visible aspects of it, possibly not even a shadow.<ref>{{cite news | first = Adrian | last = Cho | url = http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/summary/312/5777/1120a | title = High-Tech Materials Could Render Objects Invisible | work = Science | page = 1120 |date=2006-05-26 | accessdate = 2006-08-01}}</ref> This is the technique depicted in the 2000 television portrayal of [[The Invisible Man (2000 TV series)|The Invisible Man]].\n\nTwo teams of scientists worked separately to create two \"Invisibility Cloaks\" from '[[metamaterials]]' engineered at the [[nanoscale]] level. They demonstrated for the first time the possibility of cloaking three-dimensional (3-D) objects with artificially engineered materials that redirect radar, light or other waves around an object. While one uses a type of fishnet of metal layers to reverse the direction of light, the other uses tiny silver wires. Xiang Zhang, of the [[University of California]], [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]] said: \"In the case of invisibility cloaks or shields, the material would need to curve light waves completely around the object like a river flowing around a rock. An observer looking at the cloaked object would then see light from behind it, making it seem to disappear.\"\n\n[[UC Berkeley]] researcher Jason Valentine's team made a material that affects light near the visible spectrum, in a region used in fibre optics: 'Instead of the fish appearing to be slightly ahead of where it is in the water, it would actually appear to be above the water's surface. It's kind of weird. For a metamaterial to produce negative refraction, it must have a structural array smaller than the wavelength of the electromagnetic radiation being used.\" Valentine's team created their 'fishnet' material by stacking silver and metal dielectric layers on top of each other and then punching holes through them. The other team used an oxide template and grew silver nanowires inside porous aluminum oxide at tiny distances apart, smaller than the wavelength of visible light. This material refracts visible light.\n\nThe [[Imperial College London]] research team achieved results with [[microwaves]]. An invisibility cloak layout of a copper cylinder was produced in May, 2008, by physicist Professor Sir [[John Pendry]]. Scientists working with him at [[Duke University]] in the US put the idea into practice.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.themoneytimes.com/articles/20080811/scientists_turn_fiction_into_reality_closer_to_make_objects_invisible-id-1032139.html |website=themoneytimes.com |title=Scientists Turn Fiction Into Reality, Closer to Make Objects \"Invisible\" |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080816035413/http://www.themoneytimes.com/articles/20080811/scientists_turn_fiction_into_reality_closer_to_make_objects_invisible-id-1032139.html |archive-date=2008-08-16 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/top-stories/2008/08/11/secrets-of-invisibility-discovered-115875-20692852/ |website=mirror.co.uk |title=Secrets of invisibility discovered}}</ref>\n\nPendry, who theorized the invisibility cloak \"as a joke\" to illustrate the potential of metamaterials, said in an interview in August 2011 that grand, theatrical manifestations of his idea are probably overblown: \"I think it\u2019s pretty sure that any cloak that Harry Potter would recognize is not on the table. You could dream up some theory, but the very practicality of making it would be so impossible. But can you hide things from light? Yes. Can you hide things which are a few centimeters across? Yes. Is the cloak really flexible and flappy? No. Will it ever be? No. So you can do quite a lot of things, but there are limitations.

But since the character is not truly invisible, the effect could be betrayed by mirrors or other reflective surfaces.\n\nWhere [[Magic (paranormal)|magical]] invisibility is concerned, the issue may arise of whether the [[clothing]] worn by and any items carried by the invisible being are also rendered invisible.

The agent can be compared to a stone in a river, around which water passes, but slightly down-stream leaves no trace of the stone. Comparing light waves to the water, and whatever object that is being \"cloaked\" to the stone, the goal is to have light waves pass around that object, leaving no visible aspects of it, possibly not even a shadow.<ref>{{cite news | first = Adrian | last = Cho | url = http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/summary/312/5777/1120a | title = High-Tech Materials Could Render Objects Invisible | work = Science | page = 1120 |date=2006-05-26 | accessdate = 2006-08-01}}</ref> This is the technique depicted in the 2000 television portrayal of [[The Invisible Man (2000 TV series)|The Invisible Man]].\n\nTwo teams of scientists worked separately to create two \"Invisibility Cloaks\" from '[[metamaterials]]' engineered at the [[nanoscale]] level. They demonstrated for the first time the possibility of cloaking three-dimensional (3-D) objects with artificially engineered materials that redirect radar, light or other waves around an object. While one uses a type of fishnet of metal layers to reverse the direction of light, the other uses tiny silver wires. Xiang Zhang, of the [[University of California]], [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]] said: \"In the case of invisibility cloaks or shields, the material would need to curve light waves completely around the object like a river flowing around a rock. An observer looking at the cloaked object would then see light from behind it, making it seem to disappear.\"\n\n[[UC Berkeley]] researcher Jason Valentine's team made a material that affects light near the visible spectrum, in a region used in fibre optics: 'Instead of the fish appearing to be slightly ahead of where it is in the water, it would actually appear to be above the water's surface. It's kind of weird. For a metamaterial to produce negative refraction, it must have a structural array smaller than the wavelength of the electromagnetic radiation being used.\" Valentine's team created their 'fishnet' material by stacking silver and metal dielectric layers on top of each other and then punching holes through them. The other team used an oxide template and grew silver nanowires inside porous aluminum oxide at tiny distances apart, smaller than the wavelength of visible light. This material refracts visible light.\n\nThe [[Imperial College London]] research team achieved results with [[microwaves]]. An invisibility cloak layout of a copper cylinder was produced in May, 2008, by physicist Professor Sir [[John Pendry]]. Scientists working with him at [[Duke University]] in the US put the idea into practice.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.themoneytimes.com/articles/20080811/scientists_turn_fiction_into_reality_closer_to_make_objects_invisible-id-1032139.html |website=themoneytimes.com |title=Scientists Turn Fiction Into Reality, Closer to Make Objects \"Invisible\" |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080816035413/http://www.themoneytimes.com/articles/20080811/scientists_turn_fiction_into_reality_closer_to_make_objects_invisible-id-1032139.html |archive-date=2008-08-16 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/top-stories/2008/08/11/secrets-of-invisibility-discovered-115875-20692852/ |website=mirror.co.uk |title=Secrets of invisibility discovered}}</ref>\n\nPendry, who theorized the invisibility cloak \"as a joke\" to illustrate the potential of metamaterials, said in an interview in August 2011 that grand, theatrical manifestations of his idea are probably overblown: \"I think it\u2019s pretty sure that any cloak that Harry Potter would recognize is not on the table. You could dream up some theory, but the very practicality of making it would be so impossible. But can you hide things from light? Yes. Can you hide things which are a few centimeters across? Yes. Is the cloak really flexible and flappy? No. Will it ever be? No. So you can do quite a lot of things, but there are limitations.

The term was used in this manner in the title of the book ''[[Invisible Man]]'', by [[Ralph Ellison]], in reference to the protagonist, likely modeled after the author, being overlooked on account of his status as an [[African American]].

But since the character is not truly invisible, the effect could be betrayed by mirrors or other reflective surfaces.\n\nWhere [[Magic (paranormal)|magical]] invisibility is concerned, the issue may arise of whether the [[clothing]] worn by and any items carried by the invisible being are also rendered invisible.

As of February 10, 2014, CONEVAL has been established as an autonomous constitutional organization with legal personality, own proprietorship, technical and management autonomy.\n\nThe creation of CONEVAL has its origins in the creation of the General Law of Social Development (LGDS). The Law obliges this institution to coordinate the actions targeted to the achievement of the National Social Development Policy\u2019s objectives, strategies and priorities.\n\nCONEVAL is constituted by the head of the Ministry of Social Development, six Academic Researchers chosen by the National Social Development Commission through a public call, and an Executive Secretary who is in charge of the Council.\n\nFurthermore, CONEVAL issues the evaluation guidelines assigned by the Expedniture Budget Decree in order that dependencies and entities regulate their operating social programs.\n\nCONEVAL has been a ground-breaking institution in poverty measurement, providing a multidimensional approach. The institution engaged in the issuance of guidelines and criteria for the definition, identification and poverty measurement using the information generated by the National Statistics and Geography Institute (INEGI). The multidimensional poverty measurement includes the following indicators:\n*Current income per capita\n*Educational gap\n*Access to health services\n*Access to social security\n*Quality and spaces of the dwelling\n*Access to basic services in the dwelling\n* Access to food\n* Degree of social cohesion.\n \nCONEVAL has the technical capability needed to generate objective and credible information on poverty measurement and social policies. The provision of unbiased information improves the policy-making in Mexico targeted to develop better opportunities for those in need.\n\n==References==\nCONEVAL's website: http://www.coneval.gob.mx<br />\nGeneral Law of Social Development: https://web.archive.org/web/20110722125903/http://www.diputados.gob.mx/LeyesBiblio/pdf/264.pdf\n{{reflist}}\n<!--- After listing your sources please cite them using inline citations and place them after the information they cite.

It is a fast-growing, short-lived tree with opposite, compound leaves. It is sometimes considered a weedy or [[invasive species]], and has been introduced to and [[Naturalisation (biology)|naturalized]] throughout much of the world, including in South America, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, much of Europe, and parts of Asia.<ref name=woa>{{cite web |title=Acer negundo |url=https://keyserver.lucidcentral.org/weeds/data/media/Html/acer_negundo.htm |website=keyserver.lucidcentral.org |publisher=Weeds of Australia |accessdate=4 December 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"gelderen\" />\n\n==Common names==\nIndicative of its familiarity to many people over a large geographic range, ''A. negundo'' has numerous common names. The names \"box elder\" and \"boxelder maple\" are based upon the similarity of its whitish wood to that of [[Buxus|boxwood]] and the similarity of its [[pinnate]]ly compound leaves to those of some species of [[Sambucus|elder]].<ref>{{cite web |title=DePauw Nature Park Field Guide to Trees |page=14 |url=https://www.depauw.edu/files/resources/brochure---nature-park-trees.pdf |publisher=DePauw University |access-date=2018-05-24}}</ref>\n\nOther common names are based upon this maple's similarity to [[Fraxinus|ash]], its preferred environment, its sugary sap, a description of its leaves, its [[binomial name]], and so on. These names include \"Manitoba maple\", \"ash-leaf maple\", \"cut-leaved maple\", \"three-leaf maple\", \"ash maple\", \"sugar maple\", \"negundo maple\", and \"river maple\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.windsorplywood.com/ |title=Windsor Plywood}} Some of the common names given in this reference are questionable, \"stinking ash\" and \"black ash\" typically refer to ''[[Ptelea trifoliata]]'' and ''[[Fraxinus nigra]]'', respectively. This reference is retained as an example of the confusion which arises when plants such as ''A. negundo'' are discussed by other than their [[scientific name]]s.</ref> \n\nNames vary regionally.  Box elder, boxelder maple, ash-leaved maple, and maple ash are among its common names in the United States. In Canada it is commonly known as Manitoba maple and occasionally as elf maple.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://cfs.nrcan.gc.ca/index/commtreesprairies/manitobamaple |title=Community trees of the Prairie provinces |date=2007-02-22 |website=Natural Resources Canada |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080518181300/http://cfs.nrcan.gc.ca/index/commtreesprairies/manitobamaple |archive-date=2008-05-18}}</ref> in the British Isles it is known as box elder<ref name = RHSPF>{{cite web | url = https://www.rhs.org.uk/Plants/217/Acer-negundo/Details\n| title = ''Acer negundo'' | website = www.rhs.org | publisher = Royal Horticultural Society | accessdate = 26 September 2019}}</ref> or ashleaf maple.<ref name=BSBI07>{{cite web |title=BSBI List 2007 |publisher=Botanical Society of Britain and Ireland |url=http://www.bsbi.org.uk/BSBIList2007.xls |format=xls |access-date=2014-10-17 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141023044910/http://www.bsbi.org.uk/BSBIList2007.xls |archivedate=2014-10-23 }}</ref> In [[Russia]] it is known as American maple ({{lang-rus|\u0430\u043c\u0435\u0440\u0438\u043a\u0430\u0301\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u043a\u043b\u0451\u043d|amerikansky klyon}})<!-- [[Wikipedia:Romanization of Russian]] --> as well as ash-leaf maple ({{lang-rus|\u043a\u043b\u0451\u043d \u044f\u0441\u0435\u043d\u0435\u043b\u0438\u0301\u0441\u0442\u043d\u044b\u0439|klyon yasenelistny}}).\n\n==Description==\n''Acer negundo'' is a fast-growing and fairly short-lived [[tree]] that grows up to {{convert|10|-|25|m|ft|round=5|sp=us|abbr=on}} tall, with a trunk diameter of {{convert|30|-|50|cm|in|0|sp=us|abbr=on}}}, rarely up to {{convert|1|m|ft|sp=us|abbr=on}}} diameter.

These are:\n\n* ''Acer negundo'' subsp. ''negundo'', native from the [[East Coast of the United States|Atlantic Coast]] to the Rocky Mountains.<ref name=\"gelderen\" />\n* ''Acer negundo'' subsp. ''interius'', with more leaf serration than the [[nominate subspecies]] and a more [[Gloss (material appearance)|matte]] leaf surface, is native from [[Saskatchewan]] to [[New Mexico]], between the other two subspecies.<ref name=\"gelderen\" />\n* ''Acer negundo'' subsp. ''californicum'', with larger leaves with a velvety texture, is found in parts of [[California]] and [[Arizona]].<ref name=\"gelderen\" />\n\nSome authors further subdivide ''A. negundo'' subsp. ''negundo'' into a number of regional varieties but these intergrade and their maintenance as distinct [[taxa]] is disputed by many. Even the differences between recognized subspecies are probably a matter of gradient [[speciation]].{{cn|date=April 2020}}\n\n==Distribution and habitat==\n[[File:Acer negundo tree.jpg|thumb|''Acer negundo'' tree in [[North Dakota]], USA]]\n''Acer negundo'' is native across much of the [[United States]] and [[Canada]], and can be found as far south as [[Guatemala]]. \n\nAlthough native to [[North America]], it is considered a weedy species in some areas, such as in parts of the [[Northeastern United States]], and has increased greatly in these areas.<ref name=uva1997>Uva, R.H., J.C. Neal,and J.M. DiTomaso. 1997. Weeds of the Northeast. Cornell University Press. Ithaca, New York.</ref> In 1928, Joseph Illick, chief forester for the state of [[Pennsylvania]], wrote in ''Pennsylvania Trees''{{cn|date=April 2019}} that box elder was \"rare and localized\" in the state. After [[World War II]], box elder's rapid growth made it a popular landscaping tree in suburban housing developments despite its poor form, vulnerability to storm damage, and tendency to attract large numbers of [[box elder beetle]]s. Intentional cultivation has thus made the tree far more abundant than it once was.\n\nIt can quickly [[colonize]] both cultivated and uncultivated areas and the range is therefore expanding both in North America and elsewhere. In Europe where it was introduced in 1688 as a park tree it is able to spread quickly and is considered an invasive species in parts of Central Europe, including [[Germany]], the [[Czech Republic]], [[Hungary]], [[Slovenia]], and [[Poland]]) where it can form mass growth in lowlands, disturbed areas, and riparian biomes on calcareous soils. It has also become [[naturalisation (biology)|naturalized]] in eastern [[China]]<ref name=\"gelderen\" /> and can be found in some of the cooler areas of the [[Australian continent]] where it is listed as a pest [[invasive species]].\n\nThis species prefers bright sunlight. It often grows on flood plains and other disturbed areas with ample water supply, such as [[riparian]] habitats.<ref name=fotcr2017>{{cite book |last1=Wilhelm |first1=Gerould |last2=Rericha |first2=Laura |date=2017 |title=Flora of the Chicago Region: A Floristic and Ecological Synthesis |publisher=Indiana Academy of Sciences}}</ref> Human influence has greatly favored this species; it grows around houses and in hedges, as well as on disturbed ground and vacant lots.\n\n==Ecology==\nSeveral [[bird]]s and some [[squirrel]]s feed on the seeds. The [[evening grosbeak]] uses them extensively.{{cn|date=April 2020}}\n\nThe [[boxelder bug]] (''Boisea trivittata'') lays its [[egg]]s on all maples, but prefers this species, clustering the eggs in bark crevices.<ref name=fotcr2017/> The rosy maple moth (''[[Dryocampa rubicunda]]'') also lays its eggs on the leaves of maple trees, including ''Acer negundo''.

SPM is an equine neurological disease which occurs seasonally in certain areas of North America and Europe, with symptoms including stiffness, difficulty walking or standing, dark urine and eventually breathing rapidly and becoming recumbent. Ingestion of sufficient quantities of box elder seeds or other parts of the plant results in breakdown of respiratory, postural, and cardiac muscles.

It is a fast-growing, short-lived tree with opposite, compound leaves. It is sometimes considered a weedy or [[invasive species]], and has been introduced to and [[Naturalisation (biology)|naturalized]] throughout much of the world, including in South America, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, much of Europe, and parts of Asia.<ref name=woa>{{cite web |title=Acer negundo |url=https://keyserver.lucidcentral.org/weeds/data/media/Html/acer_negundo.htm |website=keyserver.lucidcentral.org |publisher=Weeds of Australia |accessdate=4 December 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"gelderen\" />\n\n==Common names==\nIndicative of its familiarity to many people over a large geographic range, ''A. negundo'' has numerous common names.

These names include \"Manitoba maple\", \"ash-leaf maple\", \"cut-leaved maple\", \"three-leaf maple\", \"ash maple\", \"sugar maple\", \"negundo maple\", and \"river maple\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.windsorplywood.com/ |title=Windsor Plywood}} Some of the common names given in this reference are questionable, \"stinking ash\" and \"black ash\" typically refer to ''[[Ptelea trifoliata]]'' and ''[[Fraxinus nigra]]'', respectively. This reference is retained as an example of the confusion which arises when plants such as ''A. negundo'' are discussed by other than their [[scientific name]]s.</ref> \n\nNames vary regionally.

Seeds are usually both prolific and [[fertility|fertile]].<ref name=Keeler />\n\nUnlike most other maples, ''A. negundo'' is fully [[dioecious]] and both a male and female tree are needed for reproduction to occur.\n\n<gallery>\nAcer negundo.jpg|Leaves and seeds\n2014-10-11 12 48 07 Box Elder Maple foliage during autumn in Elko, Nevada.JPG|Autumn leaf color\n</gallery>\n\n==Taxonomy==\nA few botanists treat boxelder maple in its own distinct genus (''Negundo aceroides'') but this is not widely accepted.{{cn|date=December 2018}}\n\n===Subspecies===\n''Acer negundo'' is often divided into three subspecies, each of which was originally described as a separate species. These are:\n\n* ''Acer negundo'' subsp. ''negundo'', native from the [[East Coast of the United States|Atlantic Coast]] to the Rocky Mountains.<ref name=\"gelderen\" />\n* ''Acer negundo'' subsp. ''interius'', with more leaf serration than the [[nominate subspecies]] and a more [[Gloss (material appearance)|matte]] leaf surface, is native from [[Saskatchewan]] to [[New Mexico]], between the other two subspecies.<ref name=\"gelderen\" />\n* ''Acer negundo'' subsp. ''californicum'', with larger leaves with a velvety texture, is found in parts of [[California]] and [[Arizona]].<ref name=\"gelderen\" />\n\nSome authors further subdivide ''A. negundo'' subsp. ''negundo'' into a number of regional varieties but these intergrade and their maintenance as distinct [[taxa]] is disputed by many. Even the differences between recognized subspecies are probably a matter of gradient [[speciation]].{{cn|date=April 2020}}\n\n==Distribution and habitat==\n[[File:Acer negundo tree.jpg|thumb|''Acer negundo'' tree in [[North Dakota]], USA]]\n''Acer negundo'' is native across much of the [[United States]] and [[Canada]], and can be found as far south as [[Guatemala]]. \n\nAlthough native to [[North America]], it is considered a weedy species in some areas, such as in parts of the [[Northeastern United States]], and has increased greatly in these areas.<ref name=uva1997>Uva, R.H., J.C. Neal,and J.M. DiTomaso. 1997. Weeds of the Northeast. Cornell University Press. Ithaca, New York.</ref> In 1928, Joseph Illick, chief forester for the state of [[Pennsylvania]], wrote in ''Pennsylvania Trees''{{cn|date=April 2019}} that box elder was \"rare and localized\" in the state. After [[World War II]], box elder's rapid growth made it a popular landscaping tree in suburban housing developments despite its poor form, vulnerability to storm damage, and tendency to attract large numbers of [[box elder beetle]]s. Intentional cultivation has thus made the tree far more abundant than it once was.\n\nIt can quickly [[colonize]] both cultivated and uncultivated areas and the range is therefore expanding both in North America and elsewhere. In Europe where it was introduced in 1688 as a park tree it is able to spread quickly and is considered an invasive species in parts of Central Europe, including [[Germany]], the [[Czech Republic]], [[Hungary]], [[Slovenia]], and [[Poland]]) where it can form mass growth in lowlands, disturbed areas, and riparian biomes on calcareous soils. It has also become [[naturalisation (biology)|naturalized]] in eastern [[China]]<ref name=\"gelderen\" /> and can be found in some of the cooler areas of the [[Australian continent]] where it is listed as a pest [[invasive species]].\n\nThis species prefers bright sunlight. It often grows on flood plains and other disturbed areas with ample water supply, such as [[riparian]] habitats.<ref name=fotcr2017>{{cite book |last1=Wilhelm |first1=Gerould |last2=Rericha |first2=Laura |date=2017 |title=Flora of the Chicago Region: A Floristic and Ecological Synthesis |publisher=Indiana Academy of Sciences}}</ref> Human influence has greatly favored this species; it grows around houses and in hedges, as well as on disturbed ground and vacant lots.\n\n==Ecology==\nSeveral [[bird]]s and some [[squirrel]]s feed on the seeds. The [[evening grosbeak]] uses them extensively.{{cn|date=April 2020}}\n\nThe [[boxelder bug]] (''Boisea trivittata'') lays its [[egg]]s on all maples, but prefers this species, clustering the eggs in bark crevices.<ref name=fotcr2017/> The rosy maple moth (''[[Dryocampa rubicunda]]'') also lays its eggs on the leaves of maple trees, including ''Acer negundo''. The larvae feed on the leaves, and in very dense populations can cause defoliation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://animaldiversity.org/accounts/Dryocampa_rubicunda/|title=Dryocampa rubicunda (rosy maple moth)|website=Animal Diversity Web|language=en|access-date=2017-11-14}}</ref>\n\nSmall [[gall]]s are formed on the leaves by a bladder mite, ''[[Aceria negundi]]''. A gall midge, ''[[Contarinia negundinis]]'' joins and enlarges the galls of ''Aceria negundi''. The midge sometimes creates a separate, tubular gall on the midrib or veins of the undersides of the leaves.<ref name=fotcr2017/>\n\nThe cottony maple leaf scale, ''[[Pulvinaria acericola]]'', occurs on the foliage of ''Acer negundo''.<ref name=fotcr2017/> A leaf spot fungus, ''[[Septoria negundinis]]'' creates black-ringed lesions on the leaves.<ref name=fotcr2017/>\n\n==Uses==\n[[File:Acer negundo bark-Clapiers~2010 04 05.jpg|thumb|upright|Young bark]]\n===Wood===\nAlthough its light, close-grained, soft wood is considered undesirable for most commercial uses, this tree has been considered as a source of wood fiber, for use in [[fiberboard]].{{cn|date=April 2020}} There is also some commercial use of the tree for various decorative applications, such as turned items (bowls, stem-ware, pens). Such purposes generally use [[burl]] or injured wood, as the injured wood develops a red stain.{{cn|date=April 2020}}\n\nThe wood has been used for a variety of purposes by [[Native Americans]], such as by the [[Navajo people|Navajo]] to make tubes for bellows,<ref>Elmore, Francis H.

SPM is an equine neurological disease which occurs seasonally in certain areas of North America and Europe, with symptoms including stiffness, difficulty walking or standing, dark urine and eventually breathing rapidly and becoming recumbent. Ingestion of sufficient quantities of box elder seeds or other parts of the plant results in breakdown of respiratory, postural, and cardiac muscles. The cause of SPM was unknown for centuries despite the disease being well known among affected areas and was only positively determined in the 21st century.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Seasonal pasture myopathy |url=https://cvm.msu.edu/research/faculty-research/valberg-laboratory/seasonal-pasture-myopathy |publisher=Michigan State University |access-date=3 January 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Seasonal pasture myopathy cause identified |url=https://www.extension.umn.edu/agriculture/horse/health/seasonal-pasture-myopathy-cause-identified/ |author=Anna Renier |publisher=University of Minnesota Extension |access-date=2018-01-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171127161146/http://www.extension.umn.edu/agriculture/horse/health/seasonal-pasture-myopathy-cause-identified/ |archive-date=2017-11-27 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref name=\"Valberg2013\">{{Cite journal |last=Valberg |first=S.J. |last2=Sponseller |first2=B.T. |last3=Hegeman |first3=A.D. |last4=Earing |first4=J. |last5=Bender |first5=J.B. |last6=Martinson |first6=K.L. |last7=Patterson |first7=S.E. |last8=Sweetman |first8=L. |date=July 2013 |title=Seasonal pasture myopathy/atypical myopathy in North America associated with ingestion of hypoglycin A within seeds of the box elder tree |journal=Equine Veterinary Journal |language=en |volume=45 |issue=4 |pages=419\u2013426 |doi=10.1111/j.2042-3306.2012.00684.x |pmid=23167695 |issn=2042-3306}}</ref> It is analogous to [[Jamaican vomiting sickness]] in humans, also caused by hypoglycin A.\n\n===Allergenicity===\n''Acer negundo'' pollen is a severe allergen.<ref name=pollenlib/> Pollen is released in winter or spring, varying with latitude and elevation.<ref name=pollenlib>{{cite web |url=http://www.pollenlibrary.com/Local/Specie/Acer+negundo/in/Santa%20clara%20County/CA/ |title=Box Elder, Ash-Leaf Maple (Acer negundo) |website=PollenLibrary.com }}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* Philips, Roger.
