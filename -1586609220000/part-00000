The film revolutionized movie-making in the [[gangster genre]],<ref>{{cite book |last=Barry |first=Langford |title=Film Genre: Hollywood and Beyond |year=2005 |publisher=Edinburgh University Press |page=134}}</ref> and was adored by the public and critics alike. ''The Godfather'' won three [[Academy Awards]]: [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]], and [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]] (shared with [[Mario Puzo]]).\n\n''[[The Godfather Part II]]'', which followed in 1974, became the first sequel to win the Academy Award for Best Picture. Highly regarded by critics, the film brought Coppola three more Academy Awards: Best Adapted Screenplay, [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]], and Best Picture, and made him the second director (after [[Billy Wilder]]) to be so honored three times for the same film. ''[[The Conversation]]'', which Coppola directed, produced and wrote, was released that same year, winning the [[Palme d'Or]] at the [[1974 Cannes Film Festival|Cannes Film Festival]]. His next film, ''[[Apocalypse Now]]'' (1979), which notoriously had a lengthy and strenuous production, was widely acclaimed for its vivid depiction of the [[Vietnam War]]. The film won the Palme d'Or, making Coppola one of only eight filmmakers to have won that award twice.\n\nHis best-known films released since the start of the 1980s are the dramas ''[[The Outsiders (film)|The Outsiders]]'' and ''[[Rumble Fish]]'' (both 1983), the crime dramas ''[[The Cotton Club (film)|The Cotton Club]]'' (1984) and ''[[The Godfather Part III]]'' (1990), and the horror film ''[[Bram Stoker's Dracula (1992 film)|Bram Stoker's Dracula]]'' (1992). A number of Coppola's relatives and children have become famous actors and filmmakers in their own right: his sister is the actress [[Talia Shire]]; his daughter [[Sofia Coppola]] and granddaughter [[Gia Coppola]] are directors, and the actors [[Jason Schwartzman]] and [[Nicolas Cage]] are his nephews.

On a budget of $40,000 ($20,000 from Corman and $20,000 from another producer who wanted to buy the movie's English rights),<ref name=\"Francis Ford Coppola Interview page 3\" /> Coppola directed in a period of nine days ''[[Dementia 13]]'', his first feature from his own screenplay. The film recouped its expenses and later became a [[cult film]] among horror buffs. It was on the sets of ''Dementia 13'' that he met his future wife [[Eleanor Coppola|Eleanor Jessie Neil]].\n\nIn 1965, Coppola won the annual Samuel Goldwyn Award for the best screenplay (''Pilma, Pilma'') written by a UCLA student.<ref name=\"Francis Ford Coppola\" /> This secured him a job as a scriptwriter with [[Seven Arts Productions|Seven Arts]]. In between, he co-wrote the scripts for ''[[This Property Is Condemned]]'' (1966) and ''[[Is Paris Burning? (film)|Is Paris Burning?]]'' (1966). However, with fame still eluding him and partly out of desperation, Coppola bought the rights to the [[David Benedictus]] novel ''You're a Big Boy Now'' and fused it with a story idea of his own, resulting in ''[[You're a Big Boy Now]]'' (1966).

Producer [[Jack L. Warner]] was nonplussed by Coppola's shaggy-haired, bearded, \"hippie\" appearance and generally left him to his own devices. He took his cast to the [[Napa County, California|Napa Valley]] for much of the outdoor shooting, but these scenes were in sharp contrast to those obviously filmed on a Hollywood soundstage, resulting in a disjointed look to the film. Dealing with outdated material at a time when the popularity of film musicals was already on the downslide, Coppola's result was only semi-successful, although Clark received a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress \u2013 Motion Picture Drama|Golden Globe]] Best Actress nomination. The film introduced to him [[George Lucas]], who became his lifelong friend as well as production assistant in his next film ''[[The Rain People]]'' in 1969. It was written, directed and initially produced by Coppola himself, though as the movie advanced, he exceeded his budget and the studio had to underwrite the remainder of the movie.<ref name=\"Francis Ford Coppola (Yahoo!)\" /> The film won the [[Golden Shell]] at the 1969 [[San Sebasti\u00e1n International Film Festival|San Sebastian Film Festival]].\n\nIn 1969, Coppola took it upon himself to subvert the studio system which he felt had stifled his visions, intending to produce mainstream pictures to finance off-beat projects and give first-time directors their chance to direct. He decided he would name his future studio \"Zoetrope\" after receiving a gift of [[zoetrope]]s from Mogens Scot-Hansen, founder of a studio called Lanterna Film and owner of a famous collection of early motion picture-making equipment. While touring [[Europe]], Coppola was introduced to alternative filmmaking equipment and inspired by the bohemian spirit of Lanterna Film, he decided he would build a deviant studio that would conceive and implement creative, unconventional approaches to filmmaking. Upon his return home, Coppola and George Lucas searched for a mansion in [[Marin County, California|Marin County]] to house the studio. However, in 1969, with equipment flowing in and no mansion found yet, the first home for [[American Zoetrope|Zoetrope Studio]] became a warehouse in [[San Francisco]] on Folsom Street.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.zoetrope.com/zoe_films.cgi?page=history |title=A Brief History of American Zoetrope |date= |accessdate=October 18, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100925031247/http://www.zoetrope.com/zoe_films.cgi?page=history |archive-date=September 25, 2010 |url-status=live}}</ref> The studio went on to become an early adopter of digital filmmaking, including some of the earliest uses of [[HDTV]].

He was not [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount's]] first choice to direct the movie; Italian director [[Sergio Leone]] was initially offered the job, but declined in order to direct his own gangster opus, ''[[Once Upon a Time in America]]''.<ref>{{cite book |author=Christopher Frayling |title=Spaghetti Westerns: Cowboys and Europeans from Karl May to Sergio Leone |url=https://books.google.com/?id=2bo9AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA215 |year=1981 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-0-7100-0503-8 |page=215}}</ref> [[Peter Bogdanovich]] was then approached but he also declined the offer and made ''[[What's Up, Doc? (1972 film)|What's Up, Doc?]]'' instead; Bogdanovich has often said that he would have cast [[Edward G. Robinson]] in the lead had he accepted the film. According to [[Robert Evans]], head of [[Paramount Pictures]] at the time, Coppola also did not initially want to direct the film because he feared it would glorify the Mafia and violence and thus reflect poorly on his [[Sicilian-American|Sicilian]] and Italian heritage; on the other hand, Evans specifically wanted an Italian-American to direct the film because his research had shown that previous films about the Mafia that were directed by non-Italians had fared dismally at the box office and he wanted to, in his own words, \"smell the spaghetti\". When Coppola hit upon the idea of making it a metaphor for American capitalism, however, he eagerly agreed to take the helm.<ref>''[[The Kid Stays in the Picture]]'' (2002), documentary film about Evans' life</ref>\n\nThere was disagreement between Paramount and Coppola on the issue of casting; Coppola stuck to his plan of casting [[Marlon Brando]] as [[Vito Corleone]], though Paramount wanted either [[Ernest Borgnine]] or [[Danny Thomas]]. At one point, Coppola was told by the then-president of Paramount that \"Marlon Brando will never appear in this motion picture\". After pleading with the executives, Coppola was allowed to cast Brando only if he appeared in the film for much less salary than his previous films, perform a screen-test and put up a bond saying that he would not cause a delay in the production (as he had done on previous film sets).<ref name=\"Look\">''The Godfather'' DVD Collection documentary ''A Look Inside'', [2001]</ref> Coppola chose Brando over [[Ernest Borgnine]] on the basis of Brando's screen test, which also won over the Paramount leadership. Brando later won an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] for his portrayal, which he refused to accept. Coppola would later recollect:<ref name=\"Francis Ford Coppola Interview page 3\" />{{Quotation| ''The Godfather'' was a very unappreciated movie when we were making it. They were very unhappy with it. They didn't like the cast. They didn't like the way I was shooting it. I was always on the verge of getting fired. So it was an extremely nightmarish experience. I had two little kids, and the third one was born during that. We lived in a little apartment, and I was basically frightened that they didn't like it. They had as much as said that, so when it was all over I wasn't at all confident that it was going to be successful, and that I'd ever get another job.}}\nAfter it was released, the film received widespread praise. It went on to win multiple awards, including the [[Academy Award for Best Picture]] and the [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay]] for Coppola. The film routinely features at the top in various polls for the greatest movies ever. It has been selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]]. In addition, it was ranked third, behind ''[[Citizen Kane]]'', and ''[[Casablanca (film)|Casablanca]]'' on the initial [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Movies]] list by the [[American Film Institute]]. It was moved up to second when the list was published again, in 2008.<ref name=\"afi\">{{cite web |work=American Film Institute |url=http://www.afi.com/Docs/about/press/2007/100movies07.pdf |title=Citizen Kane Stands the test of Time |access-date=October 21, 2010 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/61AtMtzUZ?url=http://www.afi.com/Docs/about/press/2007/100movies07.pdf |archive-date=August 24, 2011 |url-status=live}}</ref> Director [[Stanley Kubrick]] believed that ''The Godfather'' was possibly the greatest movie ever made and had without question the best cast.<ref>[http://www.visual-memory.co.uk/sk/memories/mh.htm Michael Herr for Vanity Fair] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091207071514/http://www.visual-memory.co.uk/sk/memories/mh.htm |date=December 7, 2009 }} \"He watched ''The Godfather'' again the night before and was reluctantly suggesting for the tenth time that it was possibly the greatest movie ever made and certainly the best-cast.\"</ref>\n\n====''The Conversation'' (1974)====\n{{Main|The Conversation}}\nCoppola's next film, ''The Conversation'', further cemented his position as one of the most talented [[Auteur theory|auteurs]] of Hollywood.<ref name=\"Greatest Box-Office Bombs, Disasters and Flops of All-Time\" /> The movie was partly influenced by [[Michelangelo Antonioni]]'s ''[[Blowup]]'' (1966)<ref>Murch in Ondaatje, 2002, p. 152</ref> and generated much interest when news leaked that the film utilized the very same surveillance and wire-tapping equipment that members of the [[Nixon administration]] used to spy on political opponents prior to the [[Watergate scandal]]. Coppola insisted that this was purely coincidental. The script for ''The Conversation'' was completed in the mid-1960s (before the [[1968 United States Presidential election|election of Richard Nixon]]); the spying equipment used in the film was developed through research and use of technical advisers and not by newspaper stories about the Watergate break-in. However, the audience interpreted the film to be a reaction to both the Watergate scandal and its fallout. The movie was a critical success and Coppola won his first [[Palme d'Or]] at the [[1974 Cannes Film Festival]].\n\n====''The Great Gatsby'' (1974)====\n{{Main|The Great Gatsby (1974 film)}}\nDuring the filming of ''The Conversation'', Coppola wrote the screenplay for ''The Great Gatsby''. However, in the commentary track to the DVD of ''The Godfather'' Coppola states, \"I don't think that script was [actually] made.\"<ref>Commentary track, ''The Godfather'', ''The Godfather Collection'' 2008 Blu-ray, ASIN: B000NTPDSW,</ref>\n\n====''The Godfather Part II'' (1974)====\n{{Main|The Godfather Part II}}\n\nCoppola shot ''The Godfather Part II'' parallel to ''The Conversation'' and it was the last major American motion picture to be filmed in [[Technicolor]]. George Lucas commented on the film after its five-hour-long preview, telling Coppola: \"You have two films. Take one away, it doesn't work\", referring to the movie's portrayal of two parallel storylines; one of a young [[Vito Corleone]] and the other of his son [[Michael Corleone|Michael]]. In the director's commentary on the DVD edition of the film (released in 2002), Coppola states that this film was the first major motion picture to use \"Part II\" in its title. Paramount was initially opposed to his decision to name the movie ''The Godfather Part II''. According to Coppola, the studio's objection stemmed from the belief that audiences would be reluctant to see a film with such a title, as the audience would supposedly believe that, having already seen ''The Godfather'', there was little reason to see an addition to the original story. However, the success of ''The Godfather Part II'' began the Hollywood tradition of numbered sequels. The movie was released in 1974 and went on to receive tremendous critical acclaim, with many deeming it superior to its predecessor.<ref name=\"ign\">{{cite web |url=http://movies.ign.com/articles/430/430301p1.html |title=Featured Filmmaker: Francis Ford Coppola |date=July 28, 2003 |author=Stax |accessdate=November 30, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511115731/http://movies.ign.com/articles/430/430301p1.html |archive-date=May 11, 2011 |url-status=live}}</ref> It was nominated for 11 Academy Awards and received 6 Oscars, including 3 for Coppola: Best Picture, Best Adapted Screenplay and [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]].\n\n''The Godfather Part II'' is ranked as the No. 1 greatest movie of all time in TV Guide's \"50 Best Movies of All Time\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.filmsite.org/tvguide.html |title=50 Greatest Movies (on TV and VIDEO) by TV Guide Magazine |date= |accessdate=October 18, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140331175627/http://www.filmsite.org/tvguide.html |archive-date=March 31, 2014 |url-status=live}}</ref> and is ranked at No. 7 on Entertainment Weekly's list of the \"100 Greatest Movies of All Time\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.filmsite.org/ew100.html |title=100 Greates Movies of All Time by Entertainment Weekly |date= |accessdate=October 18, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140331185517/http://www.filmsite.org/ew100.html |archive-date=March 31, 2014 |url-status=live}}</ref> The film is also featured on movie critic [[Leonard Maltin]]'s list of the \"100 Must-See Films of the 20th Century\",<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.filmsite.org/maltin2.html |title=100 Must-See Films of the 20th Century Part 2 by Leonard Maltin |date= |accessdate=October 18, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131015115555/http://www.filmsite.org/maltin2.html |archive-date=October 15, 2013 |url-status=live}}</ref> as well as Roger Ebert's \"Great Movies\" list.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/section?category=greatmovies_fulllist |title=Great Movies |date= |accessdate=October 18, 2010 |work=Chicago Sun-Times |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110105031018/http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/section?category=greatmovies_fulllist |archive-date=January 5, 2011 |url-status=live}}</ref> It was also featured on [[Sight & Sound]]'s list of the ten greatest films of all time in 2002, ranking at No. 4.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.filmsite.org/sightsound.html |title=10 Best Films of All Time Polls by Sight & Sound Magazine |date= |accessdate=October 18, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101118083212/http://www.filmsite.org/sightsound.html |archive-date=November 18, 2010 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nCoppola was the third director to have two nominations for Best Picture in the same year.

The production of the film was plagued by numerous problems, including [[typhoon]]s, nervous breakdowns, the firing of [[Harvey Keitel]], [[Martin Sheen]]'s heart attack, and extras from the Philippine military and half of the supplied helicopters leaving in the middle of scenes to go fight rebels.

The film revolutionized movie-making in the [[gangster genre]],<ref>{{cite book |last=Barry |first=Langford |title=Film Genre: Hollywood and Beyond |year=2005 |publisher=Edinburgh University Press |page=134}}</ref> and was adored by the public and critics alike. ''The Godfather'' won three [[Academy Awards]]: [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]], and [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]] (shared with [[Mario Puzo]]).\n\n''[[The Godfather Part II]]'', which followed in 1974, became the first sequel to win the Academy Award for Best Picture. Highly regarded by critics, the film brought Coppola three more Academy Awards: Best Adapted Screenplay, [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]], and Best Picture, and made him the second director (after [[Billy Wilder]]) to be so honored three times for the same film. ''[[The Conversation]]'', which Coppola directed, produced and wrote, was released that same year, winning the [[Palme d'Or]] at the [[1974 Cannes Film Festival|Cannes Film Festival]]. His next film, ''[[Apocalypse Now]]'' (1979), which notoriously had a lengthy and strenuous production, was widely acclaimed for its vivid depiction of the [[Vietnam War]]. The film won the Palme d'Or, making Coppola one of only eight filmmakers to have won that award twice.\n\nHis best-known films released since the start of the 1980s are the dramas ''[[The Outsiders (film)|The Outsiders]]'' and ''[[Rumble Fish]]'' (both 1983), the crime dramas ''[[The Cotton Club (film)|The Cotton Club]]'' (1984) and ''[[The Godfather Part III]]'' (1990), and the horror film ''[[Bram Stoker's Dracula (1992 film)|Bram Stoker's Dracula]]'' (1992).

On a budget of $40,000 ($20,000 from Corman and $20,000 from another producer who wanted to buy the movie's English rights),<ref name=\"Francis Ford Coppola Interview page 3\" /> Coppola directed in a period of nine days ''[[Dementia 13]]'', his first feature from his own screenplay. The film recouped its expenses and later became a [[cult film]] among horror buffs. It was on the sets of ''Dementia 13'' that he met his future wife [[Eleanor Coppola|Eleanor Jessie Neil]].\n\nIn 1965, Coppola won the annual Samuel Goldwyn Award for the best screenplay (''Pilma, Pilma'') written by a UCLA student.<ref name=\"Francis Ford Coppola\" /> This secured him a job as a scriptwriter with [[Seven Arts Productions|Seven Arts]].

Producer [[Jack L. Warner]] was nonplussed by Coppola's shaggy-haired, bearded, \"hippie\" appearance and generally left him to his own devices. He took his cast to the [[Napa County, California|Napa Valley]] for much of the outdoor shooting, but these scenes were in sharp contrast to those obviously filmed on a Hollywood soundstage, resulting in a disjointed look to the film. Dealing with outdated material at a time when the popularity of film musicals was already on the downslide, Coppola's result was only semi-successful, although Clark received a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress \u2013 Motion Picture Drama|Golden Globe]] Best Actress nomination. The film introduced to him [[George Lucas]], who became his lifelong friend as well as production assistant in his next film ''[[The Rain People]]'' in 1969. It was written, directed and initially produced by Coppola himself, though as the movie advanced, he exceeded his budget and the studio had to underwrite the remainder of the movie.<ref name=\"Francis Ford Coppola (Yahoo!)\" /> The film won the [[Golden Shell]] at the 1969 [[San Sebasti\u00e1n International Film Festival|San Sebastian Film Festival]].\n\nIn 1969, Coppola took it upon himself to subvert the studio system which he felt had stifled his visions, intending to produce mainstream pictures to finance off-beat projects and give first-time directors their chance to direct. He decided he would name his future studio \"Zoetrope\" after receiving a gift of [[zoetrope]]s from Mogens Scot-Hansen, founder of a studio called Lanterna Film and owner of a famous collection of early motion picture-making equipment. While touring [[Europe]], Coppola was introduced to alternative filmmaking equipment and inspired by the bohemian spirit of Lanterna Film, he decided he would build a deviant studio that would conceive and implement creative, unconventional approaches to filmmaking. Upon his return home, Coppola and George Lucas searched for a mansion in [[Marin County, California|Marin County]] to house the studio. However, in 1969, with equipment flowing in and no mansion found yet, the first home for [[American Zoetrope|Zoetrope Studio]] became a warehouse in [[San Francisco]] on Folsom Street.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.zoetrope.com/zoe_films.cgi?page=history |title=A Brief History of American Zoetrope |date= |accessdate=October 18, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100925031247/http://www.zoetrope.com/zoe_films.cgi?page=history |archive-date=September 25, 2010 |url-status=live}}</ref> The studio went on to become an early adopter of digital filmmaking, including some of the earliest uses of [[HDTV]].

Coppola and North had to tone down Patton's actual language to avoid an [[Motion picture rating system#Restricted|R rating]]; in the opening monolog, the word \"fornicating\" replaced \"fucking\" when criticizing ''[[The Saturday Evening Post]]''.

According to [[Robert Evans]], head of [[Paramount Pictures]] at the time, Coppola also did not initially want to direct the film because he feared it would glorify the Mafia and violence and thus reflect poorly on his [[Sicilian-American|Sicilian]] and Italian heritage; on the other hand, Evans specifically wanted an Italian-American to direct the film because his research had shown that previous films about the Mafia that were directed by non-Italians had fared dismally at the box office and he wanted to, in his own words, \"smell the spaghetti\". When Coppola hit upon the idea of making it a metaphor for American capitalism, however, he eagerly agreed to take the helm.<ref>''[[The Kid Stays in the Picture]]'' (2002), documentary film about Evans' life</ref>\n\nThere was disagreement between Paramount and Coppola on the issue of casting; Coppola stuck to his plan of casting [[Marlon Brando]] as [[Vito Corleone]], though Paramount wanted either [[Ernest Borgnine]] or [[Danny Thomas]]. At one point, Coppola was told by the then-president of Paramount that \"Marlon Brando will never appear in this motion picture\". After pleading with the executives, Coppola was allowed to cast Brando only if he appeared in the film for much less salary than his previous films, perform a screen-test and put up a bond saying that he would not cause a delay in the production (as he had done on previous film sets).<ref name=\"Look\">''The Godfather'' DVD Collection documentary ''A Look Inside'', [2001]</ref> Coppola chose Brando over [[Ernest Borgnine]] on the basis of Brando's screen test, which also won over the Paramount leadership. Brando later won an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] for his portrayal, which he refused to accept. Coppola would later recollect:<ref name=\"Francis Ford Coppola Interview page 3\" />{{Quotation| ''The Godfather'' was a very unappreciated movie when we were making it. They were very unhappy with it. They didn't like the cast. They didn't like the way I was shooting it. I was always on the verge of getting fired. So it was an extremely nightmarish experience. I had two little kids, and the third one was born during that. We lived in a little apartment, and I was basically frightened that they didn't like it. They had as much as said that, so when it was all over I wasn't at all confident that it was going to be successful, and that I'd ever get another job.}}\nAfter it was released, the film received widespread praise. It went on to win multiple awards, including the [[Academy Award for Best Picture]] and the [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay]] for Coppola. The film routinely features at the top in various polls for the greatest movies ever. It has been selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]]. In addition, it was ranked third, behind ''[[Citizen Kane]]'', and ''[[Casablanca (film)|Casablanca]]'' on the initial [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Movies]] list by the [[American Film Institute]]. It was moved up to second when the list was published again, in 2008.<ref name=\"afi\">{{cite web |work=American Film Institute |url=http://www.afi.com/Docs/about/press/2007/100movies07.pdf |title=Citizen Kane Stands the test of Time |access-date=October 21, 2010 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/61AtMtzUZ?url=http://www.afi.com/Docs/about/press/2007/100movies07.pdf |archive-date=August 24, 2011 |url-status=live}}</ref> Director [[Stanley Kubrick]] believed that ''The Godfather'' was possibly the greatest movie ever made and had without question the best cast.<ref>[http://www.visual-memory.co.uk/sk/memories/mh.htm Michael Herr for Vanity Fair] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091207071514/http://www.visual-memory.co.uk/sk/memories/mh.htm |date=December 7, 2009 }} \"He watched ''The Godfather'' again the night before and was reluctantly suggesting for the tenth time that it was possibly the greatest movie ever made and certainly the best-cast.\"</ref>\n\n====''The Conversation'' (1974)====\n{{Main|The Conversation}}\nCoppola's next film, ''The Conversation'', further cemented his position as one of the most talented [[Auteur theory|auteurs]] of Hollywood.<ref name=\"Greatest Box-Office Bombs, Disasters and Flops of All-Time\" /> The movie was partly influenced by [[Michelangelo Antonioni]]'s ''[[Blowup]]'' (1966)<ref>Murch in Ondaatje, 2002, p. 152</ref> and generated much interest when news leaked that the film utilized the very same surveillance and wire-tapping equipment that members of the [[Nixon administration]] used to spy on political opponents prior to the [[Watergate scandal]]. Coppola insisted that this was purely coincidental. The script for ''The Conversation'' was completed in the mid-1960s (before the [[1968 United States Presidential election|election of Richard Nixon]]); the spying equipment used in the film was developed through research and use of technical advisers and not by newspaper stories about the Watergate break-in. However, the audience interpreted the film to be a reaction to both the Watergate scandal and its fallout. The movie was a critical success and Coppola won his first [[Palme d'Or]] at the [[1974 Cannes Film Festival]].\n\n====''The Great Gatsby'' (1974)====\n{{Main|The Great Gatsby (1974 film)}}\nDuring the filming of ''The Conversation'', Coppola wrote the screenplay for ''The Great Gatsby''. However, in the commentary track to the DVD of ''The Godfather'' Coppola states, \"I don't think that script was [actually] made.\"<ref>Commentary track, ''The Godfather'', ''The Godfather Collection'' 2008 Blu-ray, ASIN: B000NTPDSW,</ref>\n\n====''The Godfather Part II'' (1974)====\n{{Main|The Godfather Part II}}\n\nCoppola shot ''The Godfather Part II'' parallel to ''The Conversation'' and it was the last major American motion picture to be filmed in [[Technicolor]]. George Lucas commented on the film after its five-hour-long preview, telling Coppola: \"You have two films. Take one away, it doesn't work\", referring to the movie's portrayal of two parallel storylines; one of a young [[Vito Corleone]] and the other of his son [[Michael Corleone|Michael]]. In the director's commentary on the DVD edition of the film (released in 2002), Coppola states that this film was the first major motion picture to use \"Part II\" in its title. Paramount was initially opposed to his decision to name the movie ''The Godfather Part II''. According to Coppola, the studio's objection stemmed from the belief that audiences would be reluctant to see a film with such a title, as the audience would supposedly believe that, having already seen ''The Godfather'', there was little reason to see an addition to the original story. However, the success of ''The Godfather Part II'' began the Hollywood tradition of numbered sequels. The movie was released in 1974 and went on to receive tremendous critical acclaim, with many deeming it superior to its predecessor.<ref name=\"ign\">{{cite web |url=http://movies.ign.com/articles/430/430301p1.html |title=Featured Filmmaker: Francis Ford Coppola |date=July 28, 2003 |author=Stax |accessdate=November 30, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511115731/http://movies.ign.com/articles/430/430301p1.html |archive-date=May 11, 2011 |url-status=live}}</ref> It was nominated for 11 Academy Awards and received 6 Oscars, including 3 for Coppola: Best Picture, Best Adapted Screenplay and [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]].\n\n''The Godfather Part II'' is ranked as the No. 1 greatest movie of all time in TV Guide's \"50 Best Movies of All Time\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.filmsite.org/tvguide.html |title=50 Greatest Movies (on TV and VIDEO) by TV Guide Magazine |date= |accessdate=October 18, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140331175627/http://www.filmsite.org/tvguide.html |archive-date=March 31, 2014 |url-status=live}}</ref> and is ranked at No. 7 on Entertainment Weekly's list of the \"100 Greatest Movies of All Time\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.filmsite.org/ew100.html |title=100 Greates Movies of All Time by Entertainment Weekly |date= |accessdate=October 18, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140331185517/http://www.filmsite.org/ew100.html |archive-date=March 31, 2014 |url-status=live}}</ref> The film is also featured on movie critic [[Leonard Maltin]]'s list of the \"100 Must-See Films of the 20th Century\",<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.filmsite.org/maltin2.html |title=100 Must-See Films of the 20th Century Part 2 by Leonard Maltin |date= |accessdate=October 18, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131015115555/http://www.filmsite.org/maltin2.html |archive-date=October 15, 2013 |url-status=live}}</ref> as well as Roger Ebert's \"Great Movies\" list.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/section?category=greatmovies_fulllist |title=Great Movies |date= |accessdate=October 18, 2010 |work=Chicago Sun-Times |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110105031018/http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/section?category=greatmovies_fulllist |archive-date=January 5, 2011 |url-status=live}}</ref> It was also featured on [[Sight & Sound]]'s list of the ten greatest films of all time in 2002, ranking at No. 4.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.filmsite.org/sightsound.html |title=10 Best Films of All Time Polls by Sight & Sound Magazine |date= |accessdate=October 18, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101118083212/http://www.filmsite.org/sightsound.html |archive-date=November 18, 2010 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nCoppola was the third director to have two nominations for Best Picture in the same year.

The production of the film was plagued by numerous problems, including [[typhoon]]s, nervous breakdowns, the firing of [[Harvey Keitel]], [[Martin Sheen]]'s heart attack, and extras from the Philippine military and half of the supplied helicopters leaving in the middle of scenes to go fight rebels.

Her four losses were against women with a combined amateur record of 20-1-1. She also has a notable victory over former UFC fighter [[Jessamyn Duke]].\n\nEvans-Smith began her professional career on March 2, 2013, in the quarterfinals for the CFA Women's PGA Tournament. In an arduous battle, full of twists, against her former amateur rival, Tori Adams, Evans-Smith won by unanimous decision, thus avenging a past loss.\n\nShe was then scheduled to fight [[Peggy Morgan]] in the semi-final round at CFA 11 but was removed from the card after auditioning for [[The Ultimate Fighter: Team Rousey vs. Team Tate|TUF 18]]. A recent report from The Wrestling Observer Newsletter announced that Evans-Smith was one of the 17 fighters selected for TUF 18 but at age 25, instead preferred to regain her place in the CFA tournament.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fightersonlymag.com/content/news/18861-report-female-tuf-18-participants-named|archive-url=https://archive.today/20160415192115/http://www.fightersonlymag.com/content/news/18861-report-female-tuf-18-participants-named|url-status=dead|archive-date=15 April 2016|title=Report: Female TUF 18 participants named - Fighters Only Magazine|accessdate=13 April 2017}}</ref>\n\nEvans-Smith automatically advanced to the finals because Morgan was removed from the tournament. Then news surfaced that she would face transgender fighter [[Fallon Fox]] because Morgan's opponent, Anna Barone, could not make the weight.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mmarising.com/news/2013/05/10/ashlee-evans-smith-now-set-to-face-anna-barone-at-cfa-11/|title=Ashlee Evans-Smith Now Set To Face Anna Barone At CFA 11 - MMARising.com|first=|last=MMARising.com|publisher=|accessdate=13 April 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Fox vs. Evans-Smith===\n\nOn October 12, 2013, Evans-Smith made it to the finals of the CFA 12 tournament, entering as a heavy underdog, reaching +425 in the bookmakers' odds. After a back-and-forth first round, she started taking over in the second round. The round ended in controversy because while Evans-Smith was applying punches from the top position, the referee failed to hear the signal announcing the end of the round, so she continued to beat on [[Fallon Fox]]. The referee called the fight a TKO in her favor when the round should have already been over. As Ashlee, her corner and the crowd celebrated, the referee informed her that he had made a mistake, and the fight would go to a third round. In the 3rd, Ashlee was able to get the top position again and managed to hit a wave of punches, until the referee intervened and stopped the fight, giving her the win by TKO in the third round.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bloodyelbow.com/2013/10/14/4839074/ufc-fighters-react-to-fallon-foxs-tko-loss-to-ashlee-evans-smith-mma-news|title=Fighters react to Fallon Fox's first loss|first=|last=ShinSplints|date=15 October 2013|publisher=Bloody Elbow}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://mmajunkie.com/2013/10/ashlee-evans-smith-had-love-hate-relationship-with-fallon-fox-controversy|title=Ashlee Evans-Smith had 'love-hate relationship' with Fallon Fox controversy|date=22 October 2013|publisher=MMA Junkie}}</ref>\n\n===WSOF===\n\nEvans-Smith then signed with the [[World Series of Fighting]] to fight Marciea Allen at [[World Series of Fighting 10: Branch vs. Taylor|WSOF 10]].

to the wolves, but I've risen to the occasion'|date=31 August 2016|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n==MMA career==\nAs an amateur, Ashlee Evans-Smith had a record of 5-4 and is the former Tuff-N-Uff Champion. Her four losses were against women with a combined amateur record of 20-1-1. She also has a notable victory over former UFC fighter [[Jessamyn Duke]].\n\nEvans-Smith began her professional career on March 2, 2013, in the quarterfinals for the CFA Women's PGA Tournament. In an arduous battle, full of twists, against her former amateur rival, Tori Adams, Evans-Smith won by unanimous decision, thus avenging a past loss.\n\nShe was then scheduled to fight [[Peggy Morgan]] in the semi-final round at CFA 11 but was removed from the card after auditioning for [[The Ultimate Fighter: Team Rousey vs. Team Tate|TUF 18]]. A recent report from The Wrestling Observer Newsletter announced that Evans-Smith was one of the 17 fighters selected for TUF 18 but at age 25, instead preferred to regain her place in the CFA tournament.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fightersonlymag.com/content/news/18861-report-female-tuf-18-participants-named|archive-url=https://archive.today/20160415192115/http://www.fightersonlymag.com/content/news/18861-report-female-tuf-18-participants-named|url-status=dead|archive-date=15 April 2016|title=Report: Female TUF 18 participants named - Fighters Only Magazine|accessdate=13 April 2017}}</ref>\n\nEvans-Smith automatically advanced to the finals because Morgan was removed from the tournament. Then news surfaced that she would face transgender fighter [[Fallon Fox]] because Morgan's opponent, Anna Barone, could not make the weight.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mmarising.com/news/2013/05/10/ashlee-evans-smith-now-set-to-face-anna-barone-at-cfa-11/|title=Ashlee Evans-Smith Now Set To Face Anna Barone At CFA 11 - MMARising.com|first=|last=MMARising.com|publisher=|accessdate=13 April 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Fox vs. Evans-Smith===\n\nOn October 12, 2013, Evans-Smith made it to the finals of the CFA 12 tournament, entering as a heavy underdog, reaching +425 in the bookmakers' odds. After a back-and-forth first round, she started taking over in the second round. The round ended in controversy because while Evans-Smith was applying punches from the top position, the referee failed to hear the signal announcing the end of the round, so she continued to beat on [[Fallon Fox]]. The referee called the fight a TKO in her favor when the round should have already been over. As Ashlee, her corner and the crowd celebrated, the referee informed her that he had made a mistake, and the fight would go to a third round. In the 3rd, Ashlee was able to get the top position again and managed to hit a wave of punches, until the referee intervened and stopped the fight, giving her the win by TKO in the third round.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bloodyelbow.com/2013/10/14/4839074/ufc-fighters-react-to-fallon-foxs-tko-loss-to-ashlee-evans-smith-mma-news|title=Fighters react to Fallon Fox's first loss|first=|last=ShinSplints|date=15 October 2013|publisher=Bloody Elbow}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://mmajunkie.com/2013/10/ashlee-evans-smith-had-love-hate-relationship-with-fallon-fox-controversy|title=Ashlee Evans-Smith had 'love-hate relationship' with Fallon Fox controversy|date=22 October 2013|publisher=MMA Junkie}}</ref>\n\n===WSOF===\n\nEvans-Smith then signed with the [[World Series of Fighting]] to fight Marciea Allen at [[World Series of Fighting 10: Branch vs. Taylor|WSOF 10]].

In spite of not being very popular with Borussia's supporters in the beginning, he won the DFB-Pokal with Dortmund by the end of his first season \u2013 the first title for Borussia Dortmund since the 1960s. Borussia Dortmund defeated Werder Bremen 4\u20131 in [[Berlin, Germany|Berlin]].\n\nIn 1991\u201392, after the arrival of the new BVB coach, [[Ottmar Hitzfeld]], he was appointed captain of the team. In the same year, Borussia Dortmund became the runner-up in the German championship. In 1993, he played in the UEFA Cup final for Borussia Dortmund against Juventus. Dortmund lost 6\u20131 on aggregate with Rummenigge scoring their only goal.\n\nRummenigge finished his career in the black and yellow football shirt of Dortmund in 1993.

The family exhibits considerable [[Biodiversity|diversity]] and includes the '''crakes''', '''coots''', and '''gallinules'''. Many [[species]] are associated with [[wetland]]s, although the family is found in every [[Terrestrial animal|terrestrial]] [[habitat]] except dry [[desert]]s, [[Polar climate|polar]] regions, and [[Alpine climate|alpine]] areas above the [[snow line]]. Members of the Rallidae occur on every continent except [[Antarctica]]. Numerous island species are known. The most common rail habitats are [[marsh]]land and dense forest. They are especially fond of dense vegetation.<ref name=h&r2003-206-7>Horsfall & Robinson (2003): pp.&nbsp;206\u2013207</ref>\n\n==Name==\n\n\"Rail\" is derived from French ''r\u00e2le'', from Old French ''rasle''.  It is named from its harsh cry, in [[Vulgar Latin]] *''rascula'', from [[Latin]] ''r\u0101dere'' ('to scrape').<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=p-q6DAAAQBAJ&pg=PT132&dq=rasculum+rail#v=onepage|title=Lapwings, Loons and Lousy Jacks: The How and Why of Bird Names|first=Ray|last=Reedman|date=15 August 2016|publisher=Pelagic Publishing Ltd|isbn=9781784270933|via=Google Books}}</ref>\n\n==Morphology==\n[[File:Takahe.jpg|thumb|right|180px|South Island [[takahe]] (''Porphyrio hochstetteri'') from behind, showing the short, soft, and fluffy [[Flight feather|remiges]] typical of flightless rails]]\nThe rails are a family of small to medium-sized, ground-living birds. They vary in length from {{convert|12|to|63|cm|in|abbr=on}} and in weight from {{convert|20|to|3000|g|oz|abbr=on}}. Some species have long necks and in many cases are laterally compressed.\n\nThe [[beak|bill]] is the most variable feature within the family. In some species, it is longer than the head (like the [[clapper rail]] of [[the Americas]]); in others, it may be short and wide (as in the [[coot]]s), or massive (as in the [[Porphyrio|purple gallinules]]).<ref name=h&r2003-208>Horsfall & Robinson (2003): p. 208</ref> A few coots and gallinules have a [[frontal shield]], which is a fleshy, rearward extension of the upper bill. The most complex frontal shield is found in the [[horned coot]].<ref name=h&r2003-210>Horsfall & Robinson (2003): p. 210</ref>\n\nRails exhibit very little [[sexual dimorphism]] in either [[plumage]] or size.\n\n===Flight and flightlessness===\nThe wings of all rails are short and rounded. The [[bird flight|flight]] of those Rallidae able to fly, while not powerful, can be sustained for long periods of time, and many species [[bird migration|migrate]] annually. The weakness of their flight, however, means they are easily blown off course, thus are common [[Vagrancy (biology)|vagrants]], a characteristic that has led them to colonize many isolated oceanic islands. Furthermore, these birds often prefer to run rather than fly, especially in dense habitat. Some are also flightless at some time during their [[moult]] periods.<ref name=h&r2003-209>Horsfall & Robinson (2003): p. 209</ref>\n\nFlightlessness in rails is one of the best examples of [[parallel evolution]] in the animal kingdom. Of the roughly 150 historically known rail species, 31 extant or recently extinct species evolved flightlessness from volant (flying) ancestors.<ref>Kirchman (2012)</ref> This process created the endemic populations of flightless rails seen on Pacific islands today.\n\nMany island rails are flightless because small island habitats without mammalian predators eliminate the need to fly or move long distances. [[Bird flight|Flight]] makes intense demands, with the [[keel (bird)|keel]] and flight muscles taking up to a quarter of a bird's weight in flying Rallidae species. Reducing the flight muscles, with a corresponding lowering of [[metabolism|metabolic]] demands, reduces the flightless rail's energy expenditures.<ref>McNab & Ellis (2006)</ref> For this reason, flightlessness makes it easier to survive and colonize an island where resources may be limited.<ref name=\"McNab 1994\">McNab (1994)</ref> This also allows for the evolution of multiple sizes of flightless rails on the same island as the birds diversify to find niches.<ref>Trewick (1997)</ref>\n\nIn addition to energy conservation, certain morphological traits also affect rail evolution. Rails have relatively shortened wings to begin with, which in combination with their terrestrial habits and behavioral flightlessness, lends speed to the evolution of flightlessness, making it remarkably fast;<ref>Livezey 2003</ref> as few as 125,000 years were needed for the [[Laysan rail]] to lose the power of flight and evolve the reduced, stubby wings only useful to keep balance when running quickly.<ref>Slikas ''et al.'' (2002)</ref> Indeed, some argue that measuring the evolution of flightlessness in rails in generations rather than millennia might be possible.<ref name=\"McNab 1994\"/>\n\nAnother factor that contributes to the occurrence of the flightless state is a climate that does not necessitate seasonal long-distance migration; this is evidenced by the tendency to evolve flightlessness at a much greater occurrence in tropical islands than in temperate or polar islands.<ref name=\"McNab 2002\">McNab 2002</ref>\n[[File:American Coot skeleton.jpg|thumb|[[American coot]] (Fulica americana) skeleton on display at the [[Museum of Osteology]].]]\nIt is paradoxical, since rails appear loath to fly, that the evolution of flightless rails would necessitate high dispersal to isolated islands.<ref name=\"McNab and Ellis 2006\">McNab and Ellis 2006</ref> Nonetheless, three species of small-massed rails, ''[[buff-banded rail|Gallirallus philippensis]]'', ''[[purple swamphen|Porphyrio porphyrio]]'', and ''[[spotless crake|Porzana tabuensis]]'', exhibit a persistently high ability to disperse long distances among tropic Pacific islands,<ref name=\"McNab and Ellis 2006\"/> though only the latter two gave rise to flightless endemic species throughout the Pacific Basin.<ref name=\"Kirchman 2012\">Kirchman 2012</ref> In examining the phylogeny of ''G. philippensis'', although the species is clearly polyphyletic (it has more than one ancestral species), it is not the ancestor of most of its flightless descendants, revealing that the flightless condition evolved in rails before speciation was complete.<ref name=\"Kirchman 2012\"/>\n\nA consequence of lowered energy expenditure in flightless island rails has also been associated with evolution of their \"tolerance\" and \"approachability\".<ref name=\"McNab 2002\"/> For example, the (non-Rallidae) Corsican [[blue tit]]s exhibit lower aggression and reduced territorial defense behaviors than do their mainland European counterparts,<ref>Perret and Blondel 1993</ref> but this tolerance may be limited to close relatives.<ref>Granjon and Cheylan 1989</ref> The resulting kin-selecting altruistic phenomena reallocate resources to produce fewer young that are more competitive and would benefit the population as an entirety, rather than many young that would exhibit less fitness.<ref name=\"McNab 2002\"/> Unfortunately, with the human occupation of most islands in the past 5,000 to 35,000 years, selection has undoubtedly reversed the tolerance into a wariness of humans and predators, causing species unequipped for the change to become susceptible to extinction.<ref name=\"McNab 2002\"/>\n\n==Behaviour and ecology==\nIn general, members of the Rallidae are omnivorous generalists. Many species eat [[invertebrate]]s, as well as fruit or seedlings. A few species are primarily [[Herbivore|herbivorous]].<ref name=h&r2003-206-7 /> The [[bird song|calls]] of Rallidae species vary and are often quite loud. Some are whistle-like or squeak-like, while others seem unbirdlike.<ref name=\"Perrins p207\">Horsfall & Robinson (2003): p.&nbsp;207</ref> Loud calls are useful in dense vegetation, or at night where seeing another member of the species is difficult. Some calls are [[Territory (animal)|territorial]].<ref name=h&r2003-208 />\n\nThe most typical family members occupy dense [[vegetation]] in damp environments near [[lake]]s, [[swamp]]s, or [[river]]s. [[Reed bed]]s are a particularly favoured habitat. Those that [[bird migration|migrate]] do so at night.\n\nMost [[bird nest|nest]] in dense vegetation. In general, they are shy, secretive, and difficult to observe. Most species walk and run vigorously on strong legs, and have long toes that are well adapted to soft, uneven surfaces. They tend to have short, rounded wings, and although they are generally weak [[Bird flight|fliers]], they are, nevertheless, capable of covering long distances. Island species often become [[Flightless bird|flightless]], and many of them are now [[Extinction|extinct]] following the introduction of terrestrial [[Predation|predators]] such as [[cat]]s, [[rat]]s, and [[pig]]s.\n\nMany reedbed species are secretive (apart from loud calls), [[crepuscular]], and have laterally flattened bodies. In the [[Old World]], long-billed species tend to be called rails and short-billed species crakes. [[North America]]n species are normally called rails irrespective of bill length. The smallest of these is [[Swinhoe's rail]], at {{convert|13|cm|in|abbr=on}} and 25&nbsp;g. The larger species are also sometimes given other names. The black coots are more adapted to open water than their relatives, and some other large species are called gallinules and swamphens. The largest of this group is the [[takahe]], at {{convert|65|cm|in|abbr=on}} and {{convert|2.7|kg|lb|abbr=on}}.\n\nThe rails have suffered disproportionally from human changes to the environment, and an estimated<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Magnitude and variation of prehistoric bird extinctions in the Pacific|first1=Richard P.|last1=Duncan|first2=Alison G.|last2=Boyer|first3=Tim M.|last3=Blackburn|year=2013|journal=PNAS|volume=110|issue=16|pages=6436\u20136441|doi=10.1073/pnas.1216511110|pmid=23530197|pmc=3631643}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://therevelator.org/memorial-day-wake-island-rail/|title=Memorializing the Wake Island Rail: An Extinction Caused by War|last=Platt|first=John R.|date=May 2018|website=TheRevelator.org}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Extinction and Biogeography of Tropical Pacific Birds|last=Steadman|first=David W.|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=2006|isbn=9780226771427|location=|pages=296}}</ref> several hundred species of island rails have become extinct because of this. Several island species of rails remain [[endangered species|endangered]], and [[bird conservation|conservation]] organisations and governments continue to work to prevent their extinction.\n\n===Reproduction===\nThe breeding behaviors of many Rallidae species are poorly understood or unknown. Most are thought to be [[Monogamy|monogamous]], although [[polygyny]] and [[polyandry]] have been reported.<ref name=h&r2003-209-10>Horsfall & Robinson (2003): pp.&nbsp;209\u2013210</ref> Most often, they lay five to 10 [[egg (biology)|eggs]]. [[Clutch (eggs)|Clutch]]es as small as one or as large as 15 eggs are known.<ref name=h&r2003-209-10 /> Egg clutches may not always hatch at the same time. Chicks become mobile after a few days. They often depend on their parents until fledging, which happens around 1 month old.<ref name=h&r2003-210 />\n\n==Rallidae and humans==\n[[File:GuamRail02.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Guam rail]] is an example of an island species that has been badly affected by [[introduced species]].]]\n\nSome larger, more abundant rails are [[hunting|hunted]] and their eggs collected for food.<ref name=h&r2003-211>Horsfall & Robinson (2003): p. 211</ref> The [[Wake Island rail]] was hunted to extinction by the starving Japanese garrison after the island was cut off from supply during [[World War II]].<ref>BLI (2007)</ref> At least two species, the [[common moorhen]] and the [[American purple gallinule]], have been considered [[Pest (organism)|pests]].<ref name=h&r2003-211 />\n\n===Threats and conservation===\nDue to their tendencies towards flightlessness, many island species have been unable to cope with introduced species. The most dramatic human-caused extinctions occurred in the [[Pacific Ocean]] as people colonised the islands of [[Melanesia]], [[Polynesia]], and [[Micronesia]], during which an estimated 750\u20131800 species of birds became extinct, half of which were rails.<ref>Steadman (2006)</ref> Some species that came close to extinction, such as the [[Lord Howe woodhen]], and the takahe, have made modest recoveries due to the efforts of conservation organisations. The [[Guam rail]] came perilously close to extinction when [[brown tree snake]]s were introduced to [[Guam]], but some of the last remaining individuals were taken into captivity and are breeding well, though attempts at reintroduction have met with mixed results.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/GUAM-BROWN-TREE-SNAKE-RESPONSIBLE-FOR-EXTINCTION-OF-5-SPECIES/4b735e75e7fe9b8d2ef464b66ecaaa0c?searchfilter=Compilations%2Furl%2FAnimal+Attacks%2F46|title=GUAM: BROWN TREE SNAKE RESPONSIBLE FOR EXTINCTION OF 5 SPECIES|last=|first=|date=February 1996|website=AP Archive|archive-url=|archive-date=|url-status=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://animals.sandiegozoo.org/animals/guam-rail|title=Guam Rail Gallirallus owstoni|last=|first=|date=|website=San Diego Zoo.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|url-status=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.birdlife.org/worldwide/news/guam-bird-coming-back-extinction-wild|title=Is this Guam bird coming back from extinction in the wild?|last=Hurrell|first=Shaun|date=|website=BirdLife International.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|url-status=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n==Systematics and evolution==\nThe family Rallidae was introduced (as Rallia) by the French [[polymath]] [[Constantine Samuel Rafinesque]] in 1815.<ref>{{ cite book | last=Rafinesque | first=Constantine Samuel | author-link=Constantine Samuel Rafinesque | year=1815 | title=Analyse de la nature ou, Tableau de l'univers et des corps organis\u00e9s | publisher=Self-published | place=Palermo | language=French | page=70 | url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/48310148 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book | last=Bock | first=Walter J. | year=1994 | title=History and Nomenclature of Avian Family-Group Names | series=Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History | volume= Number 222 | publisher=American Museum of Natural History | place=New York | pages=136, 252 | hdl=2246/830 }}<!--Linked page allows download of the 48MB pdf--></ref>\nThe family has traditionally been grouped with two families of larger birds, the [[crane (bird)|cranes]] and [[bustard]]s, as well as several smaller families of usually \"primitive\" midsized amphibious birds, to make up the order [[Gruiformes]].

The family exhibits considerable [[Biodiversity|diversity]] and includes the '''crakes''', '''coots''', and '''gallinules'''. Many [[species]] are associated with [[wetland]]s, although the family is found in every [[Terrestrial animal|terrestrial]] [[habitat]] except dry [[desert]]s, [[Polar climate|polar]] regions, and [[Alpine climate|alpine]] areas above the [[snow line]]. Members of the Rallidae occur on every continent except [[Antarctica]]. Numerous island species are known. The most common rail habitats are [[marsh]]land and dense forest. They are especially fond of dense vegetation.<ref name=h&r2003-206-7>Horsfall & Robinson (2003): pp.&nbsp;206\u2013207</ref>\n\n==Name==\n\n\"Rail\" is derived from French ''r\u00e2le'', from Old French ''rasle''.  It is named from its harsh cry, in [[Vulgar Latin]] *''rascula'', from [[Latin]] ''r\u0101dere'' ('to scrape').<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=p-q6DAAAQBAJ&pg=PT132&dq=rasculum+rail#v=onepage|title=Lapwings, Loons and Lousy Jacks: The How and Why of Bird Names|first=Ray|last=Reedman|date=15 August 2016|publisher=Pelagic Publishing Ltd|isbn=9781784270933|via=Google Books}}</ref>\n\n==Morphology==\n[[File:Takahe.jpg|thumb|right|180px|South Island [[takahe]] (''Porphyrio hochstetteri'') from behind, showing the short, soft, and fluffy [[Flight feather|remiges]] typical of flightless rails]]\nThe rails are a family of small to medium-sized, ground-living birds. They vary in length from {{convert|12|to|63|cm|in|abbr=on}} and in weight from {{convert|20|to|3000|g|oz|abbr=on}}. Some species have long necks and in many cases are laterally compressed.\n\nThe [[beak|bill]] is the most variable feature within the family. In some species, it is longer than the head (like the [[clapper rail]] of [[the Americas]]); in others, it may be short and wide (as in the [[coot]]s), or massive (as in the [[Porphyrio|purple gallinules]]).<ref name=h&r2003-208>Horsfall & Robinson (2003): p. 208</ref> A few coots and gallinules have a [[frontal shield]], which is a fleshy, rearward extension of the upper bill. The most complex frontal shield is found in the [[horned coot]].<ref name=h&r2003-210>Horsfall & Robinson (2003): p. 210</ref>\n\nRails exhibit very little [[sexual dimorphism]] in either [[plumage]] or size.\n\n===Flight and flightlessness===\nThe wings of all rails are short and rounded. The [[bird flight|flight]] of those Rallidae able to fly, while not powerful, can be sustained for long periods of time, and many species [[bird migration|migrate]] annually. The weakness of their flight, however, means they are easily blown off course, thus are common [[Vagrancy (biology)|vagrants]], a characteristic that has led them to colonize many isolated oceanic islands. Furthermore, these birds often prefer to run rather than fly, especially in dense habitat. Some are also flightless at some time during their [[moult]] periods.<ref name=h&r2003-209>Horsfall & Robinson (2003): p. 209</ref>\n\nFlightlessness in rails is one of the best examples of [[parallel evolution]] in the animal kingdom. Of the roughly 150 historically known rail species, 31 extant or recently extinct species evolved flightlessness from volant (flying) ancestors.<ref>Kirchman (2012)</ref> This process created the endemic populations of flightless rails seen on Pacific islands today.\n\nMany island rails are flightless because small island habitats without mammalian predators eliminate the need to fly or move long distances. [[Bird flight|Flight]] makes intense demands, with the [[keel (bird)|keel]] and flight muscles taking up to a quarter of a bird's weight in flying Rallidae species. Reducing the flight muscles, with a corresponding lowering of [[metabolism|metabolic]] demands, reduces the flightless rail's energy expenditures.<ref>McNab & Ellis (2006)</ref> For this reason, flightlessness makes it easier to survive and colonize an island where resources may be limited.<ref name=\"McNab 1994\">McNab (1994)</ref> This also allows for the evolution of multiple sizes of flightless rails on the same island as the birds diversify to find niches.<ref>Trewick (1997)</ref>\n\nIn addition to energy conservation, certain morphological traits also affect rail evolution. Rails have relatively shortened wings to begin with, which in combination with their terrestrial habits and behavioral flightlessness, lends speed to the evolution of flightlessness, making it remarkably fast;<ref>Livezey 2003</ref> as few as 125,000 years were needed for the [[Laysan rail]] to lose the power of flight and evolve the reduced, stubby wings only useful to keep balance when running quickly.<ref>Slikas ''et al.'' (2002)</ref> Indeed, some argue that measuring the evolution of flightlessness in rails in generations rather than millennia might be possible.<ref name=\"McNab 1994\"/>\n\nAnother factor that contributes to the occurrence of the flightless state is a climate that does not necessitate seasonal long-distance migration; this is evidenced by the tendency to evolve flightlessness at a much greater occurrence in tropical islands than in temperate or polar islands.<ref name=\"McNab 2002\">McNab 2002</ref>\n[[File:American Coot skeleton.jpg|thumb|[[American coot]] (Fulica americana) skeleton on display at the [[Museum of Osteology]].]]\nIt is paradoxical, since rails appear loath to fly, that the evolution of flightless rails would necessitate high dispersal to isolated islands.<ref name=\"McNab and Ellis 2006\">McNab and Ellis 2006</ref> Nonetheless, three species of small-massed rails, ''[[buff-banded rail|Gallirallus philippensis]]'', ''[[purple swamphen|Porphyrio porphyrio]]'', and ''[[spotless crake|Porzana tabuensis]]'', exhibit a persistently high ability to disperse long distances among tropic Pacific islands,<ref name=\"McNab and Ellis 2006\"/> though only the latter two gave rise to flightless endemic species throughout the Pacific Basin.<ref name=\"Kirchman 2012\">Kirchman 2012</ref> In examining the phylogeny of ''G. philippensis'', although the species is clearly polyphyletic (it has more than one ancestral species), it is not the ancestor of most of its flightless descendants, revealing that the flightless condition evolved in rails before speciation was complete.<ref name=\"Kirchman 2012\"/>\n\nA consequence of lowered energy expenditure in flightless island rails has also been associated with evolution of their \"tolerance\" and \"approachability\".<ref name=\"McNab 2002\"/> For example, the (non-Rallidae) Corsican [[blue tit]]s exhibit lower aggression and reduced territorial defense behaviors than do their mainland European counterparts,<ref>Perret and Blondel 1993</ref> but this tolerance may be limited to close relatives.<ref>Granjon and Cheylan 1989</ref> The resulting kin-selecting altruistic phenomena reallocate resources to produce fewer young that are more competitive and would benefit the population as an entirety, rather than many young that would exhibit less fitness.<ref name=\"McNab 2002\"/> Unfortunately, with the human occupation of most islands in the past 5,000 to 35,000 years, selection has undoubtedly reversed the tolerance into a wariness of humans and predators, causing species unequipped for the change to become susceptible to extinction.<ref name=\"McNab 2002\"/>\n\n==Behaviour and ecology==\nIn general, members of the Rallidae are omnivorous generalists. Many species eat [[invertebrate]]s, as well as fruit or seedlings. A few species are primarily [[Herbivore|herbivorous]].<ref name=h&r2003-206-7 /> The [[bird song|calls]] of Rallidae species vary and are often quite loud. Some are whistle-like or squeak-like, while others seem unbirdlike.<ref name=\"Perrins p207\">Horsfall & Robinson (2003): p.&nbsp;207</ref> Loud calls are useful in dense vegetation, or at night where seeing another member of the species is difficult. Some calls are [[Territory (animal)|territorial]].<ref name=h&r2003-208 />\n\nThe most typical family members occupy dense [[vegetation]] in damp environments near [[lake]]s, [[swamp]]s, or [[river]]s. [[Reed bed]]s are a particularly favoured habitat. Those that [[bird migration|migrate]] do so at night.\n\nMost [[bird nest|nest]] in dense vegetation. In general, they are shy, secretive, and difficult to observe. Most species walk and run vigorously on strong legs, and have long toes that are well adapted to soft, uneven surfaces. They tend to have short, rounded wings, and although they are generally weak [[Bird flight|fliers]], they are, nevertheless, capable of covering long distances. Island species often become [[Flightless bird|flightless]], and many of them are now [[Extinction|extinct]] following the introduction of terrestrial [[Predation|predators]] such as [[cat]]s, [[rat]]s, and [[pig]]s.\n\nMany reedbed species are secretive (apart from loud calls), [[crepuscular]], and have laterally flattened bodies. In the [[Old World]], long-billed species tend to be called rails and short-billed species crakes. [[North America]]n species are normally called rails irrespective of bill length. The smallest of these is [[Swinhoe's rail]], at {{convert|13|cm|in|abbr=on}} and 25&nbsp;g. The larger species are also sometimes given other names. The black coots are more adapted to open water than their relatives, and some other large species are called gallinules and swamphens. The largest of this group is the [[takahe]], at {{convert|65|cm|in|abbr=on}} and {{convert|2.7|kg|lb|abbr=on}}.\n\nThe rails have suffered disproportionally from human changes to the environment, and an estimated<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Magnitude and variation of prehistoric bird extinctions in the Pacific|first1=Richard P.|last1=Duncan|first2=Alison G.|last2=Boyer|first3=Tim M.|last3=Blackburn|year=2013|journal=PNAS|volume=110|issue=16|pages=6436\u20136441|doi=10.1073/pnas.1216511110|pmid=23530197|pmc=3631643}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://therevelator.org/memorial-day-wake-island-rail/|title=Memorializing the Wake Island Rail: An Extinction Caused by War|last=Platt|first=John R.|date=May 2018|website=TheRevelator.org}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Extinction and Biogeography of Tropical Pacific Birds|last=Steadman|first=David W.|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=2006|isbn=9780226771427|location=|pages=296}}</ref> several hundred species of island rails have become extinct because of this. Several island species of rails remain [[endangered species|endangered]], and [[bird conservation|conservation]] organisations and governments continue to work to prevent their extinction.\n\n===Reproduction===\nThe breeding behaviors of many Rallidae species are poorly understood or unknown. Most are thought to be [[Monogamy|monogamous]], although [[polygyny]] and [[polyandry]] have been reported.<ref name=h&r2003-209-10>Horsfall & Robinson (2003): pp.&nbsp;209\u2013210</ref> Most often, they lay five to 10 [[egg (biology)|eggs]]. [[Clutch (eggs)|Clutch]]es as small as one or as large as 15 eggs are known.<ref name=h&r2003-209-10 /> Egg clutches may not always hatch at the same time. Chicks become mobile after a few days. They often depend on their parents until fledging, which happens around 1 month old.<ref name=h&r2003-210 />\n\n==Rallidae and humans==\n[[File:GuamRail02.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Guam rail]] is an example of an island species that has been badly affected by [[introduced species]].]]\n\nSome larger, more abundant rails are [[hunting|hunted]] and their eggs collected for food.<ref name=h&r2003-211>Horsfall & Robinson (2003): p. 211</ref> The [[Wake Island rail]] was hunted to extinction by the starving Japanese garrison after the island was cut off from supply during [[World War II]].<ref>BLI (2007)</ref> At least two species, the [[common moorhen]] and the [[American purple gallinule]], have been considered [[Pest (organism)|pests]].<ref name=h&r2003-211 />\n\n===Threats and conservation===\nDue to their tendencies towards flightlessness, many island species have been unable to cope with introduced species. The most dramatic human-caused extinctions occurred in the [[Pacific Ocean]] as people colonised the islands of [[Melanesia]], [[Polynesia]], and [[Micronesia]], during which an estimated 750\u20131800 species of birds became extinct, half of which were rails.<ref>Steadman (2006)</ref> Some species that came close to extinction, such as the [[Lord Howe woodhen]], and the takahe, have made modest recoveries due to the efforts of conservation organisations. The [[Guam rail]] came perilously close to extinction when [[brown tree snake]]s were introduced to [[Guam]], but some of the last remaining individuals were taken into captivity and are breeding well, though attempts at reintroduction have met with mixed results.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/GUAM-BROWN-TREE-SNAKE-RESPONSIBLE-FOR-EXTINCTION-OF-5-SPECIES/4b735e75e7fe9b8d2ef464b66ecaaa0c?searchfilter=Compilations%2Furl%2FAnimal+Attacks%2F46|title=GUAM: BROWN TREE SNAKE RESPONSIBLE FOR EXTINCTION OF 5 SPECIES|last=|first=|date=February 1996|website=AP Archive|archive-url=|archive-date=|url-status=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://animals.sandiegozoo.org/animals/guam-rail|title=Guam Rail Gallirallus owstoni|last=|first=|date=|website=San Diego Zoo.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|url-status=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.birdlife.org/worldwide/news/guam-bird-coming-back-extinction-wild|title=Is this Guam bird coming back from extinction in the wild?|last=Hurrell|first=Shaun|date=|website=BirdLife International.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|url-status=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n==Systematics and evolution==\nThe family Rallidae was introduced (as Rallia) by the French [[polymath]] [[Constantine Samuel Rafinesque]] in 1815.<ref>{{ cite book | last=Rafinesque | first=Constantine Samuel | author-link=Constantine Samuel Rafinesque | year=1815 | title=Analyse de la nature ou, Tableau de l'univers et des corps organis\u00e9s | publisher=Self-published | place=Palermo | language=French | page=70 | url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/48310148 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book | last=Bock | first=Walter J. | year=1994 | title=History and Nomenclature of Avian Family-Group Names | series=Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History | volume= Number 222 | publisher=American Museum of Natural History | place=New York | pages=136, 252 | hdl=2246/830 }}<!--Linked page allows download of the 48MB pdf--></ref>\nThe family has traditionally been grouped with two families of larger birds, the [[crane (bird)|cranes]] and [[bustard]]s, as well as several smaller families of usually \"primitive\" midsized amphibious birds, to make up the order [[Gruiformes]].
