The film is known in English as ''With Cameraman Ganga Rambabu.'' The [[film]] starred [[Pawan Kalyan]], [[Tamannaah|Tamanna]], and [[Gabriela Bertante]] in lead roles, while [[Kota Srinivasa Rao]] and [[Prakash Raj]] played supporting roles. Mani Sharma composed the music, [[Shyam K. Naidu]] performed cinematography, and S. R. Shekhar performed editing. Filming started on 15 June 2012 and it was launched in [[Hyderabad]] on 14 March [[2012]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.raagalahari.com/functions/4794/cameraman-gangatho-rambabu-muhurat.aspx|title=Cameraman Gangatho Rambabu Muhurat|publisher=raagalahari.com|accessdate=25 July 2012}}</ref>\n\nSince '''''Cameraman Gangatho Rambabu''''' was released after the blockbuster hit [[Gabbar Singh (2012 film)|''Gabbar Singh'']]'','' it was considered a step-down for Pawan Kalyan's career. In 2015, the film was dubbed by Goldmines Telefilms in Hindi and Tamil languages and named ''Mera Target'' and ''Makkal Veeran,'' respectively''.'' The movie received critical acclaim. The dialogues during the pre-climax part of the movie proved crucial as the actor was known to have intentions to enter a political career.{{citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\n== Plot ==\nRambabu ([[Pawan Kalyan]]) is a hot-blooded, high-tempered mechanic who has a kind heart, as well as a tendency to react to various social incidents shown or published in the electronic media. After studying his personality, Ganga ([[Tamannaah]]), a cameraman from NC Channel, offers him a job as a journalist, and he accepts it. Ex-Chief Minister Jawahar Naidu ([[Kota Srinivasa Rao]]) tries to collapse the government and regain the CM post. He is strongly supported by his son Rana Babu ([[Prakash Raj]]), a newbie to politics. Meanwhile, reputed journalist Dasaradh Ram ([[Surya (Telugu actor)|Surya]]) supplies proof about the scams and atrocities committed by Jawahar Naidu, only to be brutally murdered by Rana Babu.\n\nAlthough everyone, including the police, is aware that Rana Babu is the murderer, he is not held accountable. Rambabu valiantly opposes him and gets him arrested. However, Rana Babu is released from jail with the help of his political friends, and he challenges Rambabu that he would be the CM by using the media. A war starts between Rambabu and Rana Babu when Rana Babu enters politics. For gaining political mileage, Rana Babu starts a movement opposing the presence of other states people in Andhra Pradesh and makes it a big movement. He even injures Rambabu severely, but he is saved by Smitha ([[Gabriela Bertante]]), who works for a rival news channel. Rambabu joins Smitha's news channel after getting discharged from the hospital.\n\nRambabu tricks Rana Babu into making some controversial statements on air, thus destroying the momentum of the movement. For making his position in politics strong, he makes Jawahar Naidu deliver his last speech and murders him, which is recorded by Rana Babu's driver, who calls Rambabu and Smitha to show them the video. Smitha shoots Rambabu, steals the video, and makes a deal with Rana Babu to disclose the whole for a hefty price. With the support of all the young blood influenced by his speech, Rambabu reaches the building where Rana Babu hosted a party for his colleagues.\n\nRambabu sends a message to the police commissioner that Rana Babu's guests should vacate the building to avoid being killed along with Rana Babu by the people. Before leaving, Smitha orders to telecast the video, only to be killed by Rana Babu. Rana Babu comes outside with his pistol and shoots Rambabu. The film ends with Rana Babu dying in the stampede of the people and Rambabu reaching the ambulance accompanied by Ganga, whom he loves and who he is being loved by.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Pawan Kalyan]] as Rambabu, a mechanic-turned-journalist\n* [[Tamannaah]] as Ganga, NC Channel cameraman and Rambabu's love interest\n* [[Gabriela Bertante]] as Smitha, rival news channel worker who gets murdered by Rana Babu\n* [[Kota Srinivasa Rao]] as Ex-Chief Minister Jawahar Naidu, the opposition leader who gets murdered by Rana babu\n* [[Prakash Raj]] as Rana Prathap Naidu, Jawahar Naidu's son who gets murdered by Rambabu\n* [[Brahmanandam]] as Bobby\n* [[Nassar (actor)|Nassar]] as Chandrasekhara Reddy, the Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh\n* [[Surya (Telugu actor)|Surya]] as Dasaradh Ram, a journalist who gets murdered by Rana Babu\n* [[Ali (actor)|Ali]] as SRK\n* [[Dharmavarapu Subramanyam]] as MD\n* [[M.

S. Rajasekhara Reddy]] as the CM.\nRS politburo member D. Sharavan said that deleting some scenes from the film would not pacify the people of [[Telangana]] and demanded a total ban on its screening.\n\nThe [[Telugu Desam Party]] (TDP) and [[AIADMK]] also sought a ban on the movie, saying it not only showed their leaders in poor light but also ridiculed their chiefs [[N. Chandrababu Naidu]] and [[Karunanidhi]]. TDP activists staged a protest demanding a ban on the movie in [[Kurnool district]] of the [[Rayalaseema]] region.\nTo end the controversy, the makers of Cameraman Gangatho Rambabu were forced to removed the objectionable content from the film.\nFinally, [[Puri Jagannadh]] said no references were made about T-movement nor TDP chief Chandrababu Naidu (Bolli dialogue) and he cannot do anything if people come to conclusions with their own interpretation of the scenes.\n\n== Production ==\n\n=== Development ===\nPawan Kalyan had previously worked with Puri Jagannadh in [[Badri (2000 film)|Badri]], which also was Puri's debut movie.

The film is known in English as ''With Cameraman Ganga Rambabu.'' The [[film]] starred [[Pawan Kalyan]], [[Tamannaah|Tamanna]], and [[Gabriela Bertante]] in lead roles, while [[Kota Srinivasa Rao]] and [[Prakash Raj]] played supporting roles. Mani Sharma composed the music, [[Shyam K. Naidu]] performed cinematography, and S. R. Shekhar performed editing. Filming started on 15 June 2012 and it was launched in [[Hyderabad]] on 14 March [[2012]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.raagalahari.com/functions/4794/cameraman-gangatho-rambabu-muhurat.aspx|title=Cameraman Gangatho Rambabu Muhurat|publisher=raagalahari.com|accessdate=25 July 2012}}</ref>.\n\nSince '''''Cameraman Gangatho Rambabu''''' was released after the blockbuster hit [[Gabbar Singh (2012 film)|''Gabbar Singh'']]'','' it was considered a step-down for Pawan Kalyan's career. In 2015, the film was dubbed by Goldmines Telefilms in Hindi and Tamil languages and named ''Mera Target'' and ''Makkal Veeran,'' respectively''.'' The movie received critical acclaim. The dialogues during the pre-climax part of the movie proved crucial as the actor was known to have intentions to enter a political career {{citation needed|date=April 2020}}.\n\n== Plot ==\nRambabu ([[Pawan Kalyan]]) is a hot-blooded, high-tempered mechanic who has a kind heart, as well as a tendency to react to various social incidents shown or published in the electronic media. After studying his personality, Ganga ([[Tamannaah]]), a cameraman from NC Channel, offers him a job as a journalist, and he accepts it. Ex-Chief Minister Jawahar Naidu ([[Kota Srinivasa Rao]]) tries to collapse the government and regain the CM post. He is strongly supported by his son Rana Babu ([[Prakash Raj]]), a newbie to politics. Meanwhile, reputed journalist Dasaradh Ram ([[Surya (Telugu actor)|Surya]]) supplies proof about the scams and atrocities committed by Jawahar Naidu, only to be brutally murdered by Rana Babu.\n\nAlthough everyone, including the police, is aware that Rana Babu is the murderer, he is not held accountable. Rambabu valiantly opposes him and gets him arrested. However, Rana Babu is released from jail with the help of his political friends, and he challenges Rambabu that he would be the CM by using the media. A war starts between Rambabu and Rana Babu when Rana Babu enters politics. For gaining political mileage, Rana Babu starts a movement opposing the presence of other states people in Andhra Pradesh and makes it a big movement. He even injures Rambabu severely, but he is saved by Smitha ([[Gabriela Bertante]]), who works for a rival news channel. Rambabu joins Smitha's news channel after getting discharged from the hospital.\n\nRambabu tricks Rana Babu into making some controversial statements on air, thus destroying the momentum of the movement. For making his position in politics strong, he makes Jawahar Naidu deliver his last speech and murders him, which is recorded by Rana Babu's driver, who calls Rambabu and Smitha to show them the video. Smitha shoots Rambabu, steals the video, and makes a deal with Rana Babu to disclose the whole for a hefty price. With the support of all the young blood influenced by his speech, Rambabu reaches the building where Rana Babu hosted a party for his colleagues.\n\nRambabu sends a message to the police commissioner that Rana Babu's guests should vacate the building to avoid being killed along with Rana Babu by the people. Before leaving, Smitha orders to telecast the video, only to be killed by Rana Babu. Rana Babu comes outside with his pistol and shoots Rambabu. The film ends with Rana Babu dying in the stampede of the people and Rambabu reaching the ambulance accompanied by Ganga, whom he loves and who he is being loved by.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Pawan Kalyan]] as Rambabu, a mechanic-turned-journalist\n* [[Tamannaah]] as Ganga, NC Channel cameraman and Rambabu's love interest\n* [[Gabriela Bertante]] as Smitha, rival news channel worker who gets murdered by Rana Babu\n* [[Kota Srinivasa Rao]] as Ex-Chief Minister Jawahar Naidu, the opposition leader who gets murdered by Rana babu\n* [[Prakash Raj]] as Rana Prathap Naidu, Jawahar Naidu's son who gets murdered by Rambabu\n* [[Brahmanandam]] as Bobby\n* [[Nassar (actor)|Nassar]] as Chandrasekhara Reddy, the Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh\n* [[Surya (Telugu actor)|Surya]] as Dasaradh Ram, a journalist who gets murdered by Rana Babu\n* [[Ali (actor)|Ali]] as SRK\n* [[Dharmavarapu Subramanyam]] as MD\n* [[M.

S. Rajasekhara Reddy]] as the CM.\nRS politburo member D. Sharavan said that deleting some scenes from the film would not pacify the people of [[Telangana]] and demanded a total ban on its screening.\n\nThe [[Telugu Desam Party]] (TDP) and [[AIADMK]] also sought a ban on the movie, saying it not only showed their leaders in poor light but also ridiculed their chiefs [[N. Chandrababu Naidu]] and [[Karunanidhi]]. TDP activists staged a protest demanding a ban on the movie in [[Kurnool district]] of the [[Rayalaseema]] region.\nTo end the controversy, the makers of Cameraman Gangatho Rambabu were forced to removed the objectionable content from the film.\nFinally, [[Puri Jagannadh]] said no references were made about T-movement nor TDP chief Chandrababu Naidu (Bolli dialogue) and he cannot do anything if people come to conclusions with their own interpretation of the scenes.\n\n== Production ==\n\n=== Development ===\nPawan Kalyan had previously worked with Puri Jagannadh in [[Badri (2000 film)|Badri]], which also was Puri's debut movie.

With the {{convert|175|lb|kg|abbr=on}} Royce Gracie winning three of the first four events, the UFC quickly proved that size does not always determine the outcome of the fight.\n\nDuring this early part of the organization, the UFC would showcase a bevy of different styles and fighters. Aside from the aforementioned [[Royce Gracie]], [[Ken Shamrock]], and [[Patrick Smith (fighter)|Patrick Smith]], the competitions also featured competitors such as [[List of halls and walks of fame|Hall of Fame]]r [[Dan Severn]], [[Marco Ruas]], [[Gary Goodridge]], [[Don Frye]], [[Kimo Leopoldo]], [[Oleg Taktarov]], and [[Tank Abbott]]. Although the first events were dominated by jiu-jitsu, other fighting styles became successful: first wrestling, then [[ground and pound]], kickboxing, boxing, and [[Clinch fighting|dirty boxing]], which eventually melded into modern [[mixed martial arts]].\n\nIn April 1995, following ''[[UFC 5]]'' in [[Charlotte, North Carolina]], Davie and Gracie sold their interest in the franchise to SEG and disbanded WOW Promotions. Davie continued with SEG as the show's booker and matchmaker, as well as the commissioner of Ultimate Fighting, until December 1997.\n\n====Emergence of stricter rules====\nAlthough UFC used the tagline \"There are no rules\" in the early 1990s, the UFC did in fact operate with limited rules. It banned biting and eye-gouging, and allowed techniques such as hair pulling, [[headbutt]]ing, [[groin attack|groin strikes]], and [[fish-hooking]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nIn a ''[[UFC 4]]'' qualifying match, competitors Jason Fairn and [[Guy Mezger]] agreed not to pull hair\u2014as they both wore pony tails tied back for the match. That same event saw a matchup between [[Keith Hackney]] and [[Joe Son]] in which Hackney unleashed a series of groin shots against Son while on the ground.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nThe UFC had a reputation, especially in the early days, as an extremely violent event, as evidenced by a disclaimer in the beginning of the ''[[UFC 5]]'' broadcast which warned audiences of the violent nature of the sport.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\n''UFC 5'' also introduced the first singles match, a rematch from the inaugural UFC featuring three-time champion Royce Gracie and Ken Shamrock, called \"The Superfight\". This proved an important development, because singles matches would feature fighters who suffered no prior damage from a previous fight in the same event, unlike tournament matches. Singles matches would become a staple in the UFC for years to come.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\n\"The Superfight\" began as a non-tournament match that would determine the first reigning UFC Champion for tournament winners to face;<ref>\n{{cite web |last=Meltzer |first=Dave |url= https://sports.yahoo.com/mma/news;_ylt=AnbS9oIfkDYxeule15884RJZEo14?slug=dm-ufcsix040809&prov=yhoo&type=lgns |title=Relive UFC 6: Clash of the Titans |work=Sports.yahoo.com |date=April 8, 2009 |accessdate=April 8, 2009}}</ref> it later evolved into a match that could feature either title matches or non-title matches. The \"Superfight\" would eventually completely phase out tournament matches; by ''[[UFC Brazil]]'', the UFC abandoned the tournament format for an entire card of singles matches (aside from a one-time ''[[UFC 23|UFC Japan]]'' tournament featuring Japanese fighters). ''[[UFC 6]]'' was the first event to feature the crowning of the first non-tournament UFC Champion, [[Ken Shamrock]].\n\n==={{anchor|Controversy and reform}}Controversy and reform: late 1990s===\nThe violent nature of the burgeoning sport quickly drew the attention of the U.S. authorities.<ref>{{cite news|last=Flegenheimer|first=Matt|title=No Resolution for Mixed Martial Arts|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/27/nyregion/obstacles-in-push-to-legalize-mixed-martial-arts-in-new-york.html?_r=1&ref=mixedmartialarts|accessdate=December 31, 2011|newspaper=The New York Times|date=June 26, 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn 1996, Senator [[John McCain]] ([[Republican Party (United States)|R]]-[[Arizona|AZ]]) saw a tape of the first UFC events and immediately found it abhorrent.

''UFC 12'' saw the introduction of weight classes and the banning of [[fish-hooking]]. For ''[[UFC 14]]'', gloves became mandatory, while kicks to the head of a downed opponent were banned. ''[[UFC 15]]'' saw limitations on hair pulling, and the banning of strikes to the back of the neck and head, headbutting, small-joint manipulations, and groin strikes.

Fighters must participate in the testing pool for at least six months prior to a fight in order to qualify for a UFC event.<ref name=\"mmajunkie.com\"/>  In February 2017, UFC made changes to the anti-doping policy, effective April 1, 2017, as follows: (1) Fighters who are new to the UFC with no previous contract would be subject to a one-month testing rule. The same rule applies to returning fighters who were terminated or whose contracts were not renewed at the decision of the UFC.  Previously, returning or terminated fighters were required to undergo four months of testings prior to competing in a fight. (2)  Returning fighters who have chosen to retire, go on hiatus, or had a non-renewal of their contract,  are required to be in a six-months testing pool prior to competition. (3) No doping violation is handed down to newly signed UFC fighters who voluntarily disclose use of a prohibited substance prior to testing. (4) \"In-competition\" testing begins at noon on the weigh-in day and ends one hour after a fighter clears a post-fight medical for non-selected post-fight testing. For fighters who are subjected to post-fight testing the in-competition testing ends after any post-fight testing is done.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://mmaimports.com/2017/03/usada-drug-testing-policies-loosen-up-for-ufc-fighters-heres-the-update/|title=USADA Drug Testing Policies Loosen Up For UFC Fighters, Here's The Update|date=2017-03-29|website=MMA Imports|language=en-US|access-date=2019-05-17}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bloodyelbow.com/2017/12/11/16740288/ufc-usada-loophole-secret-exemptions-from-drug-testing-peds-steroids|title=UFC-USADA loophole could be letting chosen athletes avoid testing in secret|last=Kidd|first=Iain|date=2017-12-11|website=Bloody Elbow|access-date=2019-05-17}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.foxnews.com/sports/ufc-and-usada-make-significant-changes-to-anti-doping-policy|title=UFC and USADA make significant changes to anti-doping policy|date=2017-02-17|website=FoxSports|language=en-US|access-date=2019-05-17}}</ref>\n\nIn September 2018, indicated no announcements would be made on fighters who have been flagged for a potential doping violation until the entire adjudication processes are conducted with the results of the potential doping violation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.lowkickmma.com/ufc-makes-major-changes-to-usada-drug-testing-policy/|title=UFC Makes Major Changes To USADA Drug-Testing Policy|last=Drahota|first=Mike|last2=MMA|first2=LowKick|date=2018-09-29|website=LowKickMMA.com|language=en-US|access-date=2019-05-17}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mmanytt.com/ufc/ufc-and-usada-make-major-change-to-anti-doping-policy-going-forward/|title=UFC and USADA Make Major Change to Anti-Doping Policy Going Forward|date=2018-09-29|website=MMAnytt.com|language=en-US|access-date=2019-05-17}}</ref> This came after several cases of fighters, such as [[Anderson Silva]], [[Junior dos Santos]], [[Josh Barnett]] and [[Cris Cyborg]], being flagged for potential doping violations, but cleared after they were proved of unintentional use of [[performance enhancing drug]]s (usually in the form of contaminated supplements).<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.mmafighting.com/2018/9/29/17918010/ufc-changes-policy-on-when-it-announces-failed-drug-tests|title=UFC changes policy on when it announces failed drug tests|work=MMA Fighting|access-date=2018-09-29}}</ref> On November 25, 2019, news surfaced that the UFC and USADA had revised their policies, providing a list of certified supplements that will not lead to sanctions should contaminated samples occur.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://mmajunkie.usatoday.com/2019/11/ufc-usada-anti-doping-policy-changes-announced|title=UFC, USADA address contaminated supplements issue with 'significant changes' to anti-doping policy|author=Simon Head|publisher=mmajunkie.com|date=November 25, 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn 2015, USADA conducted 353 tests and 2291 tests in 2016 on 586 UFC fighters with [[Anderson Silva]] tested the most of a total of 15 times.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.foxsports.com/ufc/gallery/here-are-the-ufc-fighters-usada-tested-the-most-in-2016-022317|title=Here are the UFC fighters USADA tested the most in 2016|last=ET|first=2017 at 3:01p|website=FOX Sports|language=en-US|access-date=2019-05-17}}</ref>  In 2017 and 2018 a total of 2818 and 2888 tests were conducted by USADA respectively.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ufc.usada.org/testing/results/testing-numbers/|title=Testing Numbers|website=UFC Anti-Doping Program|language=en-US|access-date=2019-05-17}}</ref>\n\nAs of May 16, 2019, a total of  76 UFC fighters have been sanctioned by USADA since the UFC USADA testing program started.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://mma-insiders.com/a-quick-look-at-all-usada-banned-ufc-fighters-since-2016-reveals-bellators-problem/|title=A quick look at all USADA banned UFC fighters since 2016 - Reveals Bellator's problem.|date=2019-05-16|website=Combat Arena|language=en-GB|access-date=2019-05-17}}</ref>\n\n==Rules==\nThe current rules for the Ultimate Fighting Championship were originally established by the [[New Jersey State Athletic Control Board|New Jersey Athletic Control Board]].<ref>[http://www.state.nj.us/lps/sacb/docs/martial.html Mixed Martial Arts Unified Rules of Conduct, Additional Mixed Martial Arts Rules] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090403062008/http://www.state.nj.us/lps/sacb/docs/martial.html |date=April 3, 2009 }}, New Jersey Athletic Control Board. Retrieved April 3, 2006.</ref> The set of \"[[Mixed martial arts rules#Unified Rules of MMA|Unified Rules of Mixed Martial Arts]]\" that New Jersey established has been adopted in other states that regulate mixed martial arts, including Nevada, Louisiana, and California. These rules are also used by many other promotions within the United States, becoming mandatory for those states that have adopted the rules, and so have become the standard ''de facto'' set of rules for professional mixed martial arts across the country.\n\n===Rounds===\nUFC matches vary in maximum length, depending on whether the match is for a Championship title, or  is a fight card's \"main event\" fight. In all fights, each round can be no longer than five minutes.  Championship fights last for a maximum of five rounds. Beginning with [[UFC 138]] on November 5, 2011, non-championship \"main event\" fights (i.e. the final fight on the card) will also last for a maximum of five rounds. Non-main event bouts last for a maximum of three rounds. [[UFC on FX: Alves vs. Kampmann]] featured the organization's first two flyweight fights as part of its first flyweight tournament, which consists of bouts that, in the event of a draw, go to a fourth \"sudden victory\" round held to determine the winner, who advances. There is a one-minute rest period between rounds.\n\n==={{anchor|Octagon}} Cage===\n[[File:Chris Weidman knock out Anderson Silva at UFC 162..jpg|thumb|Shot of the Octagon as [[Chris Weidman]] upsets [[Anderson Silva]] at [[UFC 162]].]]\nThe UFC stages bouts in an eight-sided enclosure officially named \"The Octagon\". Originally, SEG trademarked the concept as well as the term and prevented other mixed martial arts promotions from using the same type of cage, but in 2001 Zuffa gave permission for other promotions to use octagonal cages, reasoning that the young sport needed uniformity to continue to win official sanctioning.

Many fighters still chose to wear tight-fitting shorts or boxing-type trunks, while others wore long pants or singlets. Several wore wrestling shoes. Multi-time tournament Champion [[Royce Gracie]] wore a Brazilian jiu-jitsu [[Keikogi|gi]] in all of his early appearances in UFC (Gracie wore shorts against Matt Hughes at UFC 60), while [[Art Jimmerson]] appeared in UFC 1 wearing one standard boxing glove.  As of [[UFC 133]] there has been a ban on speedo style shorts after [[Dennis Hallman]] wore one in his fight against [[Brian Ebersole]].  UFC president [[Dana White]] was so furious about the fighter's choice of attire that he awarded an honorary \"getting those horrifying shorts off TV as soon as possible\" bonus to Ebersole for finishing the fight in the first round, and in following post-fight interviews made it clear that speedo style shorts will no longer be tolerated.\n\n====Reebok Uniform====\nOn December 2, 2014, the UFC and [[Reebok]] held a press conference to announce an exclusive deal for Reebok to become the worldwide outfitter for the UFC, beginning in July 2015. Financial terms of the six-year partnership were not released, but UFC officials said that though the agreement represents the most valuable non-broadcast contract the company has ever signed, the UFC will not directly profit from the new deal. Instead, company execs said the deal is structured so that the \"vast majority of the revenue\" from the deal \u2013 taking out only the costs associated with administering the new program \u2013 will be paid directly to UFC fighters.<ref name=\"ReebokUniform\">{{cite web|url=http://mmajunkie.com/2014/12/ufc-partners-with-reebok-for-uniform-program-rankings-to-determine-fighter-pay|title=UFC partners with Reebok for uniform program; rankings to determine fighter pay|publisher=mmajunkie.com|author=John Morgan|date=December 2, 2014|accessdate=December 3, 2014}}</ref>\n\nPayment on the new deal was originally expected to be based on the fighter's spot in the official [[UFC rankings]], with the exception of the UFC champions. Fighters ranked No. 1 to 5 would be paid at one level, No. 6 to 10 at a lower level, No. 11 to 15 below that, and unranked fighters at a base rate.<ref name=\"ReebokUniform\" /> The payments would remain consistent regardless of where the athletes' bouts air. In addition to the per-fight rate, fighters would also receive royalty payments representing 20 percent of any UFC merchandise sold that bears their likeness. The royalty program would also include retired fighters and continue in perpetuity. The deal itself was reported to be worth 70 million dollars which was what the fighters would be paid over the next six years which is roughly 260 thousand dollars per UFC fight card.<ref name=\"ReebokUniform\" /> In April 2015, the UFC announced that they scrapped the rankings idea and that payment will be based on the fighter's number of bouts in the octagon, with different tiers (1-5 fights, 6-10 fights, 11-15 fights, and 16-20 fights). Exceptions are made in the event of title fights, with champions and title challengers receiving greater compensation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mmajunkie.com/2015/04/ufc-fighter-rankings-will-no-longer-determine-reebok-sponsorship-pay|title=UFC: Fighter rankings will no longer determine Reebok sponsorship pay|publisher=mmajunkie.com|author=Steven Marrocco|date=April 20, 2015|accessdate=April 20, 2015}}</ref> The kits were revealed on June 30, 2015. All kits feature the fighter's name on the back of the jersey and fighters have the option to choose between a universal kit or a country kit, related to his nationality. There is also a champion kit, designed to be used only by title holders.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mmajunkie.com/2015/06/what-you-need-to-know-about-new-ufc-reebok-fight-kit-uniforms-and-gear|title=What you need to know about new UFC-Reebok 'fight kit' uniforms and gear|publisher=mmajunkie.com|author=Staff|date=June 30, 2015|accessdate=June 30, 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe new deal meant that beginning with fight week for [[UFC 189]] in Las Vegas, existing sponsors no longer appear on fighter clothing \u2013 not only on fight night, but also at all pre-fight media appearances \u2013 and in-cage sponsor banners have also eliminated. Fighter camps are outfitted with approved clothing to create a uniform look in athletes' corners. Existing sponsors are still welcome to support UFC fighters. However, third-party logos are no longer allowed on UFC broadcasts, other than title-sponsor slots \u2013 similar to those seen with European soccer clubs \u2013 that the UFC may eventually sell to \"a major, global brand\" down the road.<ref name=\"ReebokUniform\" />\n\n===Match outcome===\nMatches may end via:\n*'''[[Submission (combat sport term)|Submission]]''': a fighter clearly taps the mat or his opponent, verbally submits, or clearly communicates being in pain (such as by yelling) to a degree that causes the referee to stop the fight. Also, a technical submission may be called when a fighter either loses consciousness or is on the verge of or suffers serious injury while in a hold.\n*'''[[Knockout]]''': a fighter is put into a state of unconsciousness resulting from any legal strike.\n*'''[[Technical Knockout]]''' (TKO): If the referee decides a fighter cannot continue, the fight is ruled as a technical knockout. Technical knockouts can be classified into three categories:\n**referee stoppage (the referee ends the fight because one fighter is deemed unable to intelligently defend himself)\n**doctor stoppage (a ring side doctor decides that it is unsafe for one fighter to continue the bout, due to excessive bleeding or physical injuries)\n**corner stoppage (a fighter's cornerman signals defeat for his own fighter)\n*'''Judges' Decision''': Depending on scoring, a match may end as:\n**unanimous decision (all three judges score a win for fighter A)\n**majority decision (two judges score a win for fighter A, one judge scores a draw)\n**split decision (two judges score a win for fighter A, one judge scores a win for fighter B)\n**technical decision (a fighter is rendered unable to continue as a result of an unintentional illegal element or move, resulting in a decision based on the finished and unfinished rounds if the number of rounds to be judged is sufficient)\n**unanimous draw (all three judges score a draw)\n**majority draw (two judges score a draw, one judge scoring a win)\n**split draw (one judge scores a win for fighter A, one judge scores a win for fighter B, and one judge scores a draw)\n**technical draw (the bout ends in a manner similar to that of a technical decision, with the judges' scores resulting in a draw)\n*'''Disqualification''': a fighter intentionally executes an illegal move that is considered by the referee or opponent to be injurious or significant enough to negatively alter the opponent's performance should the fight continue, resulting in the opponent's victory.\n*'''Forfeit''': a fighter fails to compete or intentionally and prematurely ends the bout for a reason besides injury, resulting in the opponent's victory.\n*'''No Contest''': a fighter is rendered unable to continue or compete effectively as a result of an unintentional illegal element or move and there is not a sufficient number of finished rounds to be judged to make a technical decision viable, or both fighters are rendered unable to continue or compete effectively. Also, a fight may be ruled a no contest if the original outcome of the bout is changed due to unsatisfactory or illegal circumstances, such as a premature stoppage or a fighter's testing positive for banned substances.\n\nIn the event of a draw, it is not necessary that the fighters' total ''points'' be equal (see, e.g., ''[[UFC 41]]'' Penn vs. Uno, or ''[[UFC 43]]'' Freeman vs. White). However, in a unanimous or split draw, each fighter does score an equal number of ''win judgments'' from the three judges (0 or 1, respectively). Additionally, if a title fight ends in a draw, the defending champ retains the title.\n\n===Judging criteria===\nThe [[10-point must system|ten-point must system]] is in effect for all UFC fights; three judges score each round and the winner of each receives ten points while the loser receives nine points or fewer (although 10\u201310 rounds are given in the rare event that a judge feels the rounds was too close to warrant giving one fighter 10 and the other 9.)  Scores of 10\u20138 are typically awarded for dominant rounds and anything more dominant is scored less. 10\u20137 rounds are very rare.\n\n===Fouls===\nThe Nevada State Athletic Commission currently lists the following as fouls:<ref>[http://www.leg.state.nv.us/NAC/NAC-467.html NSAC Regulations: Chapter 467 \u2013 Unarmed Combat].

If a foul incapacitates a fighter, then the match may end in a disqualification if the foul was intentional, or a no contest if unintentional. If a foul causes a fighter to be unable to continue later in the bout, it ends with a technical decision win to the injured fighter if the injured fighter is ahead on points, otherwise it is a technical draw.<ref>[http://boxing.nv.gov/docs/MMA%20RULES%20Expained.pdf MMA rules explained.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060615195416/http://boxing.nv.gov/docs/MMA%20RULES%20Expained.pdf |date=June 15, 2006 }} Nevada State Athletic Commission. Retrieved June 30, 2006.</ref>\n\n===Match conduct===\n*After a verbal warning the referee can stop the fighters and stand them up if they reach a stalemate on the ground (where neither are in a dominant [[Grappling position|position]] or working towards one). This rule is codified in Nevada as the ''stand-up rule''.\n*If the referee pauses the match, it is resumed with the fighters in their prior positions.\n*Grabbing the cage brings a verbal warning, followed by an attempt by the referee to release the grab by pulling on the grabbing hand. If that attempt fails or if the fighter continues to hold the cage, the referee may charge a foul.\n*Early UFC events disregarded verbal sparring / \"trash-talking\" during matches. Under unified rules, antics are permitted before events to add to excitement and allow fighters to express themselves, but abusive language during combat is prohibited.\n\n===Evolution of the rules===\n*''[[UFC 1]]'' \u2013 Although the advertising said ''There Are No Rules'', there were in fact some rules: no biting, no eye-gouging and no groin attacks. Fights ended only in the event of a knockout, submission or the corner throwing in the towel. Despite this, the first match in ''UFC 1'' was won by referee stoppage, even though it was not officially recognized as such at the time.\n*''[[UFC 2]]'' \u2013 Groin attacks were unbanned. Time limits were dropped ending the need for judges. Modifications to the cage were added (the fence became 5 feet tall but would continually grow in height afterwards and the floor became the canvas that is still used today).\n*''[[UFC 3]]'' \u2013 The referee was officially given the authority to stop a fight in case of a fighter being unable to defend himself. A fighter could not kick if he was wearing shoes. This rule would later be discarded, then changed to 'no kicking with shoes while on the ground' and then reinstated, before finally being discarded.\n*''[[UFC 4]]'' \u2013 After tournament alternate [[Steve Jennum]] won ''UFC 3'' by winning only one bout, alternates (replacements) were required to win a pre-tournament bout to qualify for the role of an alternate.\n*''[[UFC 5]]'' \u2013 The organizers introduced a 30-minute time limit. ''UFC 5'' also saw the first Superfight, a one-off bout between two competitors selected by the organizers with the winner being crowned 'Superfight champion' and having the duty of defending his title at the next UFC.\n*''[[UFC 6]]'' \u2013 The referee was given the authority to restart the fight. If two fighters were entangled in a position where there was a ''lack of action'', the referee could stop the fight and restart the competitors on their feet, in their own corner. In ''UFC 6'' they officially adopted the 5-minute extension to the 30-minute rule which had been used in ''UFC 5''.\n*''[[Ultimate Ultimate 1995]]'' \u2013 This event was the first to introduce the no fish-hooking rule and to reinstate judges. Time limits were changed to 15 minutes in the quarter-finals, 18 minutes in the semi-finals and 27 minutes in the finals.\n*''[[UFC 8]]'' \u2013 Time limits changed to 10 minutes in the first two rounds of the tournament, 15 minutes in the tournament final and Superfight. Time limits would continually change in the later UFC events. Fights could now be decided by a judges decision if the fight reached the end of the time limit. The panel was made up of three judges who simply raised a card with the name of the fighter they considered to be the winner. In this fashion, a draw was not possible since the only two possible outcomes of a decision were 3 to 0 or 2 to 1 in favor of the winner.\n*''[[UFC 9]]'' \u2013 To appease local authorities, closed fisted strikes to the head were banned for this event only. The commentators were not aware of this last minute rule that was made to prevent the cancellation of the event due to local political pressures. Referee [[John McCarthy (referee)|\"Big John\" McCarthy]] made repeated warnings to the fighters to \"open the hand\" when this rule was violated. However, not one fighter was reprimanded. UFC 9 was also the last UFC event to feature the superfight.\n*''[[Ultimate Ultimate 1996]]'' \u2013 This event was the first to introduce the \"no grabbing of the fence\" rule.\n*''[[UFC 12]]'' \u2013 The main tournament split into a heavyweight (over 200&nbsp;lbs.) and lightweight (200&nbsp;lbs. and under) division; and the eight-man tournament ceased. Fighters now needed to win only two fights to win the competition. The Heavyweight Champion title (and title bouts) was introduced, replacing the Superfight title (albeit matches were still for a time branded as \"Superfights\").\n*''[[UFC 14]]'' \u2013 The lightweight division was re-branded middleweight. The wearing of padded gloves, weighing 110 to 170&nbsp;g (4 to 6&nbsp;ounces), becomes mandatory. Gloves were to be approved by the UFC. Hair-pulling, groin strikes and kicks to a downed opponent became illegal.\n*''[[UFC 15]]'' \u2013 Limits on permissible striking areas were introduced. Headbutts, elbow strikes to the back of the neck and head and small joint manipulation became illegal.\n*''[[UFC 21]]'' \u2013 Five minute rounds were introduced, with preliminary bouts consisting of two rounds, regular non-title bouts at three rounds, and title bouts at five rounds. The \"ten-point must system\" was introduced for scoring fights (identical to the system widely used in boxing).\n* ''[[UFC 28]]'' \u2013 The [[New Jersey State Athletic Control Board]] sanctions its first UFC event, using the newly developed ''[[Unified Rules of Mixed Martial Arts]]''. Major changes to the UFC's rules included barring knee strikes to the head of a downed opponent, elbow strikes to the spine and neck and punches to the back of the neck and head. Limits on permissible ring attire, stringent medical requirements, and regulatory oversight were also introduced. A new weight class system was also introduced.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ivansblog.com/2006/07/mixed-martial-arts-new-jersey.html|title=Ivan's Blog--- Ivan Trembow's Self-Important, Random Rants on Mixed Martial Arts, Video Games, Pro Wrestling, Television, Politics, Sports, and High-Quality Wool Socks|work=ivansblog.com}}</ref> This new set of rules is currently the ''de facto'' standard for MMA events held in the U.S. and is still in use by the UFC.\n* ''[[UFC 31]]'' \u2013 Weight classes are re-aligned to the current standard. Bantamweight moves from 150 to 155 and becomes known as [[Lightweight (MMA)|lightweight]]. Lightweight becomes known as [[Welterweight (MMA)|welterweight]], middleweight becomes [[Light Heavyweight (MMA)|light heavyweight]], and a new [[Middleweight (MMA)|middleweight]] class is introduced at 185 pounds. Stools and seconds are first permitted in The Octagon between rounds.\n*''[[UFC 43]]'' \u2013 In the event of a stoppage fights restart in the position the fight was stopped.\n* ''[[UFC 94]]'' \u2013 After an incident where [[Georges St-Pierre]] was accused of putting [[vaseline]] on his back, corner men were disallowed from bringing vaseline into The Octagon.

Match outcomes also do not need to be immediately posted publicly, which allows for fight results to remain unknown to the public until the airdate of the episode.\n\nFor two-round matches, if there is a draw after two rounds, an extra five-minute round (\"[[sudden victory]]\") is contested. If the extra round concludes without a stoppage, the judges' decision will be based on that final round.\n\nThese exhibition matches variably have two or three rounds, depending on the rules used for each season. In most seasons, preliminary matches (before the semi-final bouts) were two rounds; in season two, all matches had three rounds. All matches past the first round use three rounds as per standard UFC bouts. During the finales for each series, the division finals have the standard three rounds, plus a fourth round if the judges score a tie.\n\n==Weight divisions/Current champions==\n[[File:UFC-Champs.PNG|1000px|thumb|left]]\n{{See also|Mixed martial arts weight classes}}\n{{See also|List of UFC champions}}\n\nThe UFC currently uses nine different weight classes:<ref name=\"ufc.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ufc.com/discover/sport/rules-and-regulations#2|title=Rules and Regulations \u2013 Unified Rules and Other MMA Regulations|publisher=UFC|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180105020540/https://www.ufc.com/discover/sport/rules-and-regulations|archivedate=2018-01-05}}</ref>\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 80%;\"\n|-\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Weight class name\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Minimum Weight (lb)\n!colspan=\"3\"|Upper limit\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Gender\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Current champion\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Date won\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Ref\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Days<br />held \n!rowspan=\"2\"|Defenses\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Next Fight\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Ref\n|-\n!in [[Pound (mass)|pounds]] (lb)\n!in kilograms (kg)\n!in [[Stone (unit)|stone]] (st)\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|align=\"left\"|[[Strawweight (MMA)|Strawweight]]\n|None\n|115\n|52.2\n|8&nbsp;st 3&nbsp;lb \n|style=\"background:#F19CBB;|Women \n| style=\"background:#F19CBB;|{{flagicon|CHN}} [[Weili Zhang]]\n| August 31, 2019\n|<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cagesidepress.com/2019/08/31/ufc-shenzhen-results-andrade-vs-zhang/|title=UFC Shenzhen Results: Weili Zhang Shocks With Quick TKO of Andrade, Becomes First Chinese UFC Champ|last=McClory|first=Mike|date=2019-08-31|website=Cageside Press|language=en-US|access-date=2019-08-31}}</ref>\n|{{age in days|month1=08|day1=31|year1=2019}}\n| 1\n| (TBA)\n|\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:left;\"|[[Flyweight (MMA)|Flyweight]]\n|rowspan=2|116\n|rowspan=2|125\n|rowspan=2|56.7\n|rowspan=2|8&nbsp;st 13&nbsp;lb \n|style=\"background:#BBF;

Fighters will typically get paid money to fight, called show money, with an additional bonus if they win, called a win bonus. Despite not being officially confirmed by the UFC, [[Justin Gaethje]] revealed in January 2019 that headlining an event nets additional $25,000 per fighter.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mmamania.com/2019/1/28/18201022/ufc-justin-gaethje-case-higher-headliner-pay-pass-away-in-rounds-four-five-mma|author=Adam Guillen Jr.|publisher=mmamania.com|title=Justin Gaethje wants a UFC pay raise in case he dies in the fourth round}}</ref> While fighters new to the UFC can make as little as about $10,000 per fight (without a win bonus), more established fighters have made as much as $500,000 to $1 million per fight. Occasionally, fighters will earn more. For example, at [[UFC 202]], [[Conor McGregor]] made a reported $3 million, a UFC record for one fight, while his opponent [[Nate Diaz]] made a reported $2 million. The combined $5 million made between the fighters was the largest combined fight purse in UFC history.<ref>{{cite web |title=Conor McGregor Breaks Brock Lesnar's Record for Biggest Fight Purse at UFC 202 |url=https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2658946-conor-mcgregor-breaks-brock-lesnars-record-for-biggest-fight-purse-at-ufc-202 |website=BleacherReport.com}}</ref>\n\nCash bonuses are also awarded for \"Fight of the Night\" and \"Performance of the Night\" (formerly awarded separately as \"Knockout of the Night\").<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mmanuts.com/news/ufc-eliminates-ko-submission-night-awards/|title=UFC Eliminates KO and Submission of the Night Awards |publisher=mmanuts.com|author=Dave Walsh |date=February 11, 2014|accessdate= February 11, 2014}}</ref> The size of these bonuses can sometimes be US$80,000 (but are normally US$50,000).

With the {{convert|175|lb|kg|abbr=on}} Royce Gracie winning three of the first four events, the UFC quickly proved that size does not always determine the outcome of the fight.\n\nDuring this early part of the organization, the UFC would showcase a bevy of different styles and fighters. Aside from the aforementioned [[Royce Gracie]], [[Ken Shamrock]], and [[Patrick Smith (fighter)|Patrick Smith]], the competitions also featured competitors such as [[List of halls and walks of fame|Hall of Fame]]r [[Dan Severn]], [[Marco Ruas]], [[Gary Goodridge]], [[Don Frye]], [[Kimo Leopoldo]], [[Oleg Taktarov]], and [[Tank Abbott]]. Although the first events were dominated by jiu-jitsu, other fighting styles became successful: first wrestling, then [[ground and pound]], kickboxing, boxing, and [[Clinch fighting|dirty boxing]], which eventually melded into modern [[mixed martial arts]].\n\nIn April 1995, following ''[[UFC 5]]'' in [[Charlotte, North Carolina]], Davie and Gracie sold their interest in the franchise to SEG and disbanded WOW Promotions. Davie continued with SEG as the show's booker and matchmaker, as well as the commissioner of Ultimate Fighting, until December 1997.\n\n====Emergence of stricter rules====\nAlthough UFC used the tagline \"There are no rules\" in the early 1990s, the UFC did in fact operate with limited rules. It banned biting and eye-gouging, and allowed techniques such as hair pulling, [[headbutt]]ing, [[groin attack|groin strikes]], and [[fish-hooking]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nIn a ''[[UFC 4]]'' qualifying match, competitors Jason Fairn and [[Guy Mezger]] agreed not to pull hair\u2014as they both wore pony tails tied back for the match. That same event saw a matchup between [[Keith Hackney]] and [[Joe Son]] in which Hackney unleashed a series of groin shots against Son while on the ground.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nThe UFC had a reputation, especially in the early days, as an extremely violent event, as evidenced by a disclaimer in the beginning of the ''[[UFC 5]]'' broadcast which warned audiences of the violent nature of the sport.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\n''UFC 5'' also introduced the first singles match, a rematch from the inaugural UFC featuring three-time champion Royce Gracie and Ken Shamrock, called \"The Superfight\". This proved an important development, because singles matches would feature fighters who suffered no prior damage from a previous fight in the same event, unlike tournament matches. Singles matches would become a staple in the UFC for years to come.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\n\"The Superfight\" began as a non-tournament match that would determine the first reigning UFC Champion for tournament winners to face;<ref>\n{{cite web |last=Meltzer |first=Dave |url= https://sports.yahoo.com/mma/news;_ylt=AnbS9oIfkDYxeule15884RJZEo14?slug=dm-ufcsix040809&prov=yhoo&type=lgns |title=Relive UFC 6: Clash of the Titans |work=Sports.yahoo.com |date=April 8, 2009 |accessdate=April 8, 2009}}</ref> it later evolved into a match that could feature either title matches or non-title matches. The \"Superfight\" would eventually completely phase out tournament matches; by ''[[UFC Brazil]]'', the UFC abandoned the tournament format for an entire card of singles matches (aside from a one-time ''[[UFC 23|UFC Japan]]'' tournament featuring Japanese fighters). ''[[UFC 6]]'' was the first event to feature the crowning of the first non-tournament UFC Champion, [[Ken Shamrock]].\n\n==={{anchor|Controversy and reform}}Controversy and reform: late 1990s===\nThe violent nature of the burgeoning sport quickly drew the attention of the U.S. authorities.<ref>{{cite news|last=Flegenheimer|first=Matt|title=No Resolution for Mixed Martial Arts|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/27/nyregion/obstacles-in-push-to-legalize-mixed-martial-arts-in-new-york.html?_r=1&ref=mixedmartialarts|accessdate=December 31, 2011|newspaper=The New York Times|date=June 26, 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn 1996, Senator [[John McCain]] ([[Republican Party (United States)|R]]-[[Arizona|AZ]]) saw a tape of the first UFC events and immediately found it abhorrent.

''UFC 12'' saw the introduction of weight classes and the banning of [[fish-hooking]]. For ''[[UFC 14]]'', gloves became mandatory, while kicks to the head of a downed opponent were banned. ''[[UFC 15]]'' saw limitations on hair pulling, and the banning of strikes to the back of the neck and head, headbutting, small-joint manipulations, and groin strikes.

SEG could not secure home-video releases for ''[[UFC 23]]'' through ''[[UFC 29]]''. With other mixed martial arts promotions working towards U.S. sanctioning, the International Fighting Championships (IFC) secured the first U.S. sanctioned mixed-martial-arts event, which occurred in New Jersey on September 30, 2000.

The same rule applies to returning fighters who were terminated or whose contracts were not renewed at the decision of the UFC.  Previously, returning or terminated fighters were required to undergo four months of testings prior to competing in a fight. (2)  Returning fighters who have chosen to retire, go on hiatus, or had a non-renewal of their contract,  are required to be in a six-months testing pool prior to competition.

Retrieved April 3, 2006.</ref> The set of \"[[Mixed martial arts rules#Unified Rules of MMA|Unified Rules of Mixed Martial Arts]]\" that New Jersey established has been adopted in other states that regulate mixed martial arts, including Nevada, Louisiana, and California. These rules are also used by many other promotions within the United States, becoming mandatory for those states that have adopted the rules, and so have become the standard ''de facto'' set of rules for professional mixed martial arts across the country.\n\n===Rounds===\nUFC matches vary in maximum length, depending on whether the match is for a Championship title, or  is a fight card's \"main event\" fight. In all fights, each round can be no longer than five minutes.  Championship fights last for a maximum of five rounds. Beginning with [[UFC 138]] on November 5, 2011, non-championship \"main event\" fights (i.e. the final fight on the card) will also last for a maximum of five rounds. Non-main event bouts last for a maximum of three rounds. [[UFC on FX: Alves vs. Kampmann]] featured the organization's first two flyweight fights as part of its first flyweight tournament, which consists of bouts that, in the event of a draw, go to a fourth \"sudden victory\" round held to determine the winner, who advances. There is a one-minute rest period between rounds.\n\n==={{anchor|Octagon}} Cage===\n[[File:Chris Weidman knock out Anderson Silva at UFC 162..jpg|thumb|Shot of the Octagon as [[Chris Weidman]] upsets [[Anderson Silva]] at [[UFC 162]].]]\nThe UFC stages bouts in an eight-sided enclosure officially named \"The Octagon\". Originally, SEG trademarked the concept as well as the term and prevented other mixed martial arts promotions from using the same type of cage, but in 2001 Zuffa gave permission for other promotions to use octagonal cages, reasoning that the young sport needed uniformity to continue to win official sanctioning. Today Zuffa reserves exclusive use of the name \"The Octagon\".<ref>Gentry, Clyde, ''No Holds Barred: Ultimate Fighting and the Martial Arts Revolution'', (Milo Books: Preston, 2005), p.208</ref>\n\nThe UFC cage is an octagonal structure with walls of metal chain-link fence coated with black vinyl.

Many fighters still chose to wear tight-fitting shorts or boxing-type trunks, while others wore long pants or singlets. Several wore wrestling shoes. Multi-time tournament Champion [[Royce Gracie]] wore a Brazilian jiu-jitsu [[Keikogi|gi]] in all of his early appearances in UFC (Gracie wore shorts against Matt Hughes at UFC 60), while [[Art Jimmerson]] appeared in UFC 1 wearing one standard boxing glove.  As of [[UFC 133]] there has been a ban on speedo style shorts after [[Dennis Hallman]] wore one in his fight against [[Brian Ebersole]].  UFC president [[Dana White]] was so furious about the fighter's choice of attire that he awarded an honorary \"getting those horrifying shorts off TV as soon as possible\" bonus to Ebersole for finishing the fight in the first round, and in following post-fight interviews made it clear that speedo style shorts will no longer be tolerated.\n\n====Reebok Uniform====\nOn December 2, 2014, the UFC and [[Reebok]] held a press conference to announce an exclusive deal for Reebok to become the worldwide outfitter for the UFC, beginning in July 2015. Financial terms of the six-year partnership were not released, but UFC officials said that though the agreement represents the most valuable non-broadcast contract the company has ever signed, the UFC will not directly profit from the new deal. Instead, company execs said the deal is structured so that the \"vast majority of the revenue\" from the deal \u2013 taking out only the costs associated with administering the new program \u2013 will be paid directly to UFC fighters.<ref name=\"ReebokUniform\">{{cite web|url=http://mmajunkie.com/2014/12/ufc-partners-with-reebok-for-uniform-program-rankings-to-determine-fighter-pay|title=UFC partners with Reebok for uniform program; rankings to determine fighter pay|publisher=mmajunkie.com|author=John Morgan|date=December 2, 2014|accessdate=December 3, 2014}}</ref>\n\nPayment on the new deal was originally expected to be based on the fighter's spot in the official [[UFC rankings]], with the exception of the UFC champions. Fighters ranked No. 1 to 5 would be paid at one level, No. 6 to 10 at a lower level, No. 11 to 15 below that, and unranked fighters at a base rate.<ref name=\"ReebokUniform\" /> The payments would remain consistent regardless of where the athletes' bouts air. In addition to the per-fight rate, fighters would also receive royalty payments representing 20 percent of any UFC merchandise sold that bears their likeness. The royalty program would also include retired fighters and continue in perpetuity. The deal itself was reported to be worth 70 million dollars which was what the fighters would be paid over the next six years which is roughly 260 thousand dollars per UFC fight card.<ref name=\"ReebokUniform\" /> In April 2015, the UFC announced that they scrapped the rankings idea and that payment will be based on the fighter's number of bouts in the octagon, with different tiers (1-5 fights, 6-10 fights, 11-15 fights, and 16-20 fights). Exceptions are made in the event of title fights, with champions and title challengers receiving greater compensation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mmajunkie.com/2015/04/ufc-fighter-rankings-will-no-longer-determine-reebok-sponsorship-pay|title=UFC: Fighter rankings will no longer determine Reebok sponsorship pay|publisher=mmajunkie.com|author=Steven Marrocco|date=April 20, 2015|accessdate=April 20, 2015}}</ref> The kits were revealed on June 30, 2015. All kits feature the fighter's name on the back of the jersey and fighters have the option to choose between a universal kit or a country kit, related to his nationality. There is also a champion kit, designed to be used only by title holders.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mmajunkie.com/2015/06/what-you-need-to-know-about-new-ufc-reebok-fight-kit-uniforms-and-gear|title=What you need to know about new UFC-Reebok 'fight kit' uniforms and gear|publisher=mmajunkie.com|author=Staff|date=June 30, 2015|accessdate=June 30, 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe new deal meant that beginning with fight week for [[UFC 189]] in Las Vegas, existing sponsors no longer appear on fighter clothing \u2013 not only on fight night, but also at all pre-fight media appearances \u2013 and in-cage sponsor banners have also eliminated. Fighter camps are outfitted with approved clothing to create a uniform look in athletes' corners. Existing sponsors are still welcome to support UFC fighters. However, third-party logos are no longer allowed on UFC broadcasts, other than title-sponsor slots \u2013 similar to those seen with European soccer clubs \u2013 that the UFC may eventually sell to \"a major, global brand\" down the road.<ref name=\"ReebokUniform\" />\n\n===Match outcome===\nMatches may end via:\n*'''[[Submission (combat sport term)|Submission]]''': a fighter clearly taps the mat or his opponent, verbally submits, or clearly communicates being in pain (such as by yelling) to a degree that causes the referee to stop the fight. Also, a technical submission may be called when a fighter either loses consciousness or is on the verge of or suffers serious injury while in a hold.\n*'''[[Knockout]]''': a fighter is put into a state of unconsciousness resulting from any legal strike.\n*'''[[Technical Knockout]]''' (TKO): If the referee decides a fighter cannot continue, the fight is ruled as a technical knockout. Technical knockouts can be classified into three categories:\n**referee stoppage (the referee ends the fight because one fighter is deemed unable to intelligently defend himself)\n**doctor stoppage (a ring side doctor decides that it is unsafe for one fighter to continue the bout, due to excessive bleeding or physical injuries)\n**corner stoppage (a fighter's cornerman signals defeat for his own fighter)\n*'''Judges' Decision''': Depending on scoring, a match may end as:\n**unanimous decision (all three judges score a win for fighter A)\n**majority decision (two judges score a win for fighter A, one judge scores a draw)\n**split decision (two judges score a win for fighter A, one judge scores a win for fighter B)\n**technical decision (a fighter is rendered unable to continue as a result of an unintentional illegal element or move, resulting in a decision based on the finished and unfinished rounds if the number of rounds to be judged is sufficient)\n**unanimous draw (all three judges score a draw)\n**majority draw (two judges score a draw, one judge scoring a win)\n**split draw (one judge scores a win for fighter A, one judge scores a win for fighter B, and one judge scores a draw)\n**technical draw (the bout ends in a manner similar to that of a technical decision, with the judges' scores resulting in a draw)\n*'''Disqualification''': a fighter intentionally executes an illegal move that is considered by the referee or opponent to be injurious or significant enough to negatively alter the opponent's performance should the fight continue, resulting in the opponent's victory.\n*'''Forfeit''': a fighter fails to compete or intentionally and prematurely ends the bout for a reason besides injury, resulting in the opponent's victory.\n*'''No Contest''': a fighter is rendered unable to continue or compete effectively as a result of an unintentional illegal element or move and there is not a sufficient number of finished rounds to be judged to make a technical decision viable, or both fighters are rendered unable to continue or compete effectively. Also, a fight may be ruled a no contest if the original outcome of the bout is changed due to unsatisfactory or illegal circumstances, such as a premature stoppage or a fighter's testing positive for banned substances.\n\nIn the event of a draw, it is not necessary that the fighters' total ''points'' be equal (see, e.g., ''[[UFC 41]]'' Penn vs. Uno, or ''[[UFC 43]]'' Freeman vs. White). However, in a unanimous or split draw, each fighter does score an equal number of ''win judgments'' from the three judges (0 or 1, respectively). Additionally, if a title fight ends in a draw, the defending champ retains the title.\n\n===Judging criteria===\nThe [[10-point must system|ten-point must system]] is in effect for all UFC fights; three judges score each round and the winner of each receives ten points while the loser receives nine points or fewer (although 10\u201310 rounds are given in the rare event that a judge feels the rounds was too close to warrant giving one fighter 10 and the other 9.)  Scores of 10\u20138 are typically awarded for dominant rounds and anything more dominant is scored less. 10\u20137 rounds are very rare.\n\n===Fouls===\nThe Nevada State Athletic Commission currently lists the following as fouls:<ref>[http://www.leg.state.nv.us/NAC/NAC-467.html NSAC Regulations: Chapter 467 \u2013 Unarmed Combat].

If a foul incapacitates a fighter, then the match may end in a disqualification if the foul was intentional, or a no contest if unintentional. If a foul causes a fighter to be unable to continue later in the bout, it ends with a technical decision win to the injured fighter if the injured fighter is ahead on points, otherwise it is a technical draw.<ref>[http://boxing.nv.gov/docs/MMA%20RULES%20Expained.pdf MMA rules explained.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060615195416/http://boxing.nv.gov/docs/MMA%20RULES%20Expained.pdf |date=June 15, 2006 }} Nevada State Athletic Commission. Retrieved June 30, 2006.</ref>\n\n===Match conduct===\n*After a verbal warning the referee can stop the fighters and stand them up if they reach a stalemate on the ground (where neither are in a dominant [[Grappling position|position]] or working towards one). This rule is codified in Nevada as the ''stand-up rule''.\n*If the referee pauses the match, it is resumed with the fighters in their prior positions.\n*Grabbing the cage brings a verbal warning, followed by an attempt by the referee to release the grab by pulling on the grabbing hand. If that attempt fails or if the fighter continues to hold the cage, the referee may charge a foul.\n*Early UFC events disregarded verbal sparring / \"trash-talking\" during matches. Under unified rules, antics are permitted before events to add to excitement and allow fighters to express themselves, but abusive language during combat is prohibited.\n\n===Evolution of the rules===\n*''[[UFC 1]]'' \u2013 Although the advertising said ''There Are No Rules'', there were in fact some rules: no biting, no eye-gouging and no groin attacks. Fights ended only in the event of a knockout, submission or the corner throwing in the towel. Despite this, the first match in ''UFC 1'' was won by referee stoppage, even though it was not officially recognized as such at the time.\n*''[[UFC 2]]'' \u2013 Groin attacks were unbanned. Time limits were dropped ending the need for judges. Modifications to the cage were added (the fence became 5 feet tall but would continually grow in height afterwards and the floor became the canvas that is still used today).\n*''[[UFC 3]]'' \u2013 The referee was officially given the authority to stop a fight in case of a fighter being unable to defend himself. A fighter could not kick if he was wearing shoes. This rule would later be discarded, then changed to 'no kicking with shoes while on the ground' and then reinstated, before finally being discarded.\n*''[[UFC 4]]'' \u2013 After tournament alternate [[Steve Jennum]] won ''UFC 3'' by winning only one bout, alternates (replacements) were required to win a pre-tournament bout to qualify for the role of an alternate.\n*''[[UFC 5]]'' \u2013 The organizers introduced a 30-minute time limit. ''UFC 5'' also saw the first Superfight, a one-off bout between two competitors selected by the organizers with the winner being crowned 'Superfight champion' and having the duty of defending his title at the next UFC.\n*''[[UFC 6]]'' \u2013 The referee was given the authority to restart the fight. If two fighters were entangled in a position where there was a ''lack of action'', the referee could stop the fight and restart the competitors on their feet, in their own corner. In ''UFC 6'' they officially adopted the 5-minute extension to the 30-minute rule which had been used in ''UFC 5''.\n*''[[Ultimate Ultimate 1995]]'' \u2013 This event was the first to introduce the no fish-hooking rule and to reinstate judges. Time limits were changed to 15 minutes in the quarter-finals, 18 minutes in the semi-finals and 27 minutes in the finals.\n*''[[UFC 8]]'' \u2013 Time limits changed to 10 minutes in the first two rounds of the tournament, 15 minutes in the tournament final and Superfight. Time limits would continually change in the later UFC events. Fights could now be decided by a judges decision if the fight reached the end of the time limit. The panel was made up of three judges who simply raised a card with the name of the fighter they considered to be the winner. In this fashion, a draw was not possible since the only two possible outcomes of a decision were 3 to 0 or 2 to 1 in favor of the winner.\n*''[[UFC 9]]'' \u2013 To appease local authorities, closed fisted strikes to the head were banned for this event only. The commentators were not aware of this last minute rule that was made to prevent the cancellation of the event due to local political pressures. Referee [[John McCarthy (referee)|\"Big John\" McCarthy]] made repeated warnings to the fighters to \"open the hand\" when this rule was violated. However, not one fighter was reprimanded. UFC 9 was also the last UFC event to feature the superfight.\n*''[[Ultimate Ultimate 1996]]'' \u2013 This event was the first to introduce the \"no grabbing of the fence\" rule.\n*''[[UFC 12]]'' \u2013 The main tournament split into a heavyweight (over 200&nbsp;lbs.) and lightweight (200&nbsp;lbs. and under) division; and the eight-man tournament ceased. Fighters now needed to win only two fights to win the competition. The Heavyweight Champion title (and title bouts) was introduced, replacing the Superfight title (albeit matches were still for a time branded as \"Superfights\").\n*''[[UFC 14]]'' \u2013 The lightweight division was re-branded middleweight. The wearing of padded gloves, weighing 110 to 170&nbsp;g (4 to 6&nbsp;ounces), becomes mandatory. Gloves were to be approved by the UFC. Hair-pulling, groin strikes and kicks to a downed opponent became illegal.\n*''[[UFC 15]]'' \u2013 Limits on permissible striking areas were introduced. Headbutts, elbow strikes to the back of the neck and head and small joint manipulation became illegal.\n*''[[UFC 21]]'' \u2013 Five minute rounds were introduced, with preliminary bouts consisting of two rounds, regular non-title bouts at three rounds, and title bouts at five rounds. The \"ten-point must system\" was introduced for scoring fights (identical to the system widely used in boxing).\n* ''[[UFC 28]]'' \u2013 The [[New Jersey State Athletic Control Board]] sanctions its first UFC event, using the newly developed ''[[Unified Rules of Mixed Martial Arts]]''. Major changes to the UFC's rules included barring knee strikes to the head of a downed opponent, elbow strikes to the spine and neck and punches to the back of the neck and head. Limits on permissible ring attire, stringent medical requirements, and regulatory oversight were also introduced. A new weight class system was also introduced.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ivansblog.com/2006/07/mixed-martial-arts-new-jersey.html|title=Ivan's Blog--- Ivan Trembow's Self-Important, Random Rants on Mixed Martial Arts, Video Games, Pro Wrestling, Television, Politics, Sports, and High-Quality Wool Socks|work=ivansblog.com}}</ref> This new set of rules is currently the ''de facto'' standard for MMA events held in the U.S. and is still in use by the UFC.\n* ''[[UFC 31]]'' \u2013 Weight classes are re-aligned to the current standard.

Match outcomes also do not need to be immediately posted publicly, which allows for fight results to remain unknown to the public until the airdate of the episode.\n\nFor two-round matches, if there is a draw after two rounds, an extra five-minute round (\"[[sudden victory]]\") is contested. If the extra round concludes without a stoppage, the judges' decision will be based on that final round.\n\nThese exhibition matches variably have two or three rounds, depending on the rules used for each season. In most seasons, preliminary matches (before the semi-final bouts) were two rounds; in season two, all matches had three rounds. All matches past the first round use three rounds as per standard UFC bouts. During the finales for each series, the division finals have the standard three rounds, plus a fourth round if the judges score a tie.\n\n==Weight divisions/Current champions==\n[[File:UFC-Champs.PNG|1000px|thumb|left]]\n{{See also|Mixed martial arts weight classes}}\n{{See also|List of UFC champions}}\n\nThe UFC currently uses nine different weight classes:<ref name=\"ufc.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ufc.com/discover/sport/rules-and-regulations#2|title=Rules and Regulations \u2013 Unified Rules and Other MMA Regulations|publisher=UFC|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180105020540/https://www.ufc.com/discover/sport/rules-and-regulations|archivedate=2018-01-05}}</ref>\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 80%;\"\n|-\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Weight class name\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Minimum Weight (lb)\n!colspan=\"3\"|Upper limit\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Gender\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Current champion\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Date won\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Ref\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Days<br />held \n!rowspan=\"2\"|Defenses\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Next Fight\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Ref\n|-\n!in [[Pound (mass)|pounds]] (lb)\n!in kilograms (kg)\n!in [[Stone (unit)|stone]] (st)\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|align=\"left\"|[[Strawweight (MMA)|Strawweight]]\n|None\n|115\n|52.2\n|8&nbsp;st 3&nbsp;lb \n|style=\"background:#F19CBB;|Women \n| style=\"background:#F19CBB;|{{flagicon|CHN}} [[Weili Zhang]]\n| August 31, 2019\n|<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cagesidepress.com/2019/08/31/ufc-shenzhen-results-andrade-vs-zhang/|title=UFC Shenzhen Results: Weili Zhang Shocks With Quick TKO of Andrade, Becomes First Chinese UFC Champ|last=McClory|first=Mike|date=2019-08-31|website=Cageside Press|language=en-US|access-date=2019-08-31}}</ref>\n|{{age in days|month1=08|day1=31|year1=2019}}\n| 1\n| (TBA)\n|\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:left;\"|[[Flyweight (MMA)|Flyweight]]\n|rowspan=2|116\n|rowspan=2|125\n|rowspan=2|56.7\n|rowspan=2|8&nbsp;st 13&nbsp;lb \n|style=\"background:#BBF;

Fighters will typically get paid money to fight, called show money, with an additional bonus if they win, called a win bonus. Despite not being officially confirmed by the UFC, [[Justin Gaethje]] revealed in January 2019 that headlining an event nets additional $25,000 per fighter.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mmamania.com/2019/1/28/18201022/ufc-justin-gaethje-case-higher-headliner-pay-pass-away-in-rounds-four-five-mma|author=Adam Guillen Jr.|publisher=mmamania.com|title=Justin Gaethje wants a UFC pay raise in case he dies in the fourth round}}</ref> While fighters new to the UFC can make as little as about $10,000 per fight (without a win bonus), more established fighters have made as much as $500,000 to $1 million per fight. Occasionally, fighters will earn more. For example, at [[UFC 202]], [[Conor McGregor]] made a reported $3 million, a UFC record for one fight, while his opponent [[Nate Diaz]] made a reported $2 million. The combined $5 million made between the fighters was the largest combined fight purse in UFC history.<ref>{{cite web |title=Conor McGregor Breaks Brock Lesnar's Record for Biggest Fight Purse at UFC 202 |url=https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2658946-conor-mcgregor-breaks-brock-lesnars-record-for-biggest-fight-purse-at-ufc-202 |website=BleacherReport.com}}</ref>\n\nCash bonuses are also awarded for \"Fight of the Night\" and \"Performance of the Night\" (formerly awarded separately as \"Knockout of the Night\").<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mmanuts.com/news/ufc-eliminates-ko-submission-night-awards/|title=UFC Eliminates KO and Submission of the Night Awards |publisher=mmanuts.com|author=Dave Walsh |date=February 11, 2014|accessdate= February 11, 2014}}</ref> The size of these bonuses can sometimes be US$80,000 (but are normally US$50,000).

After the war, it made land grants in Nova Scotia to Loyalists (including nearly 3,000 [[Black Loyalists]], [[freed slave|slaves of rebels]] given freedom after joining British forces).

They developed friendly relations with the peoples of the [[Wabanaki Confederacy]] (particularly the regional [[Mi'kmaq people|Mi'kmaq]]), learning their hunting and fishing techniques developed for local conditions. The Acadians lived mainly in the coastal regions of the Bay of Fundy; they reclaimed farming land from the sea through building dikes to control water and drain certain wetlands. Living in a contested borderland region between French Canada (modern Quebec) and the British territories on New England and the coast, the Acadians often became entangled in the conflict between the powers. Their competition in Europe played out in North America as well. Over a period of seventy-four years, six wars took place in Acadia and Nova Scotia, in which the Confederacy and some Acadians fought to keep the British from taking over the region (See the four [[French and Indian Wars]] as well as [[Father Rale's War]] and [[Father Le Loutre's War]]).\n\nWhile France lost political control of Acadia in 1713, the M\u00ed'kmaq did not concede land to the British. Along with some Acadians, the Mi'kmaq from time to time used military force to resist the British.  That was particularly evident in the early 1720s during [[Dummer's War]], but hostilities were brought to a close by a treaty signed in 1726.\n\nThe British had conquered Acadia in 1710. Over the next 45 years, the Acadians refused to sign an unconditional oath of allegiance to Britain. Many were influenced by Father [[Jean-Louis Le Loutre]], who from his arrival in 1738 until his capture in 1755, preached against the 'English devils'.<ref>{{cite book|last=Parkman|first=Francis|authorlink=Francis Parkman|title=Montcalm and Wolfe|url=https://archive.org/details/montcalmandwolf08parkgoog|series=France and England in North America|year=1914|publisher=Little, Brown|orig-year=1884}}</ref> Acadians took part in various militia operations against the British and maintained vital supply lines to the French [[Fortress of Louisbourg]] and [[Fort Beausejour]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Grenier|first=John|title=The Far Reaches of Empire: War in Nova Scotia, 1710\u20131760|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TXoCBQAAQBAJ&pg=PP1|year=2008|publisher=University of Oklahoma Press|isbn=978-0-8061-8566-8}}</ref> During the [[French and Indian War]], the British sought to neutralize any military threat posed by the Acadians and to interrupt the vital supply lines which they provided to Louisbourg by deporting Acadians from Acadia.<ref>{{cite book |last=Patterson |first=Stephen E. |chapter=Indian-White Relations in Nova Scotia, 1749\u201361: A Study in Political Interaction |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jnxIPgAACAAJ&pg=PA105 |editor1-last=Buckner |editor1-first=Phillip Alfred |editor2-last=Campbell |editor2-first=Gail Grace |editor3-last=Frank |editor3-first=David |title=The Acadiensis Reader: Atlantic Canada Before Confederation |date=1998 |pages=105\u2013106}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Patterson|first=Stephen E.|chapter=1744\u20131763: Colonial Wars and Aboriginal Peoples|editor1=Phillip Buckner|editor2=John G.

The French and British competition had a long history, including opposing Christian established religions: Catholic in France and its colonies, and Protestant (Anglican) in England.<ref>For the best account of Acadian armed resistance to the British, see Grenier, John. ''The Far Reaches of Empire. War in Nova Scotia, 1710-1760.'' Norman: U of Oklahoma P, 2008.</ref> Acadians had numerous reasons against signing an oath of loyalty to the British Crown. As noted, the British monarch was the head of the (Protestant) Anglican Church of England. Acadian men feared that signing the oath would commit them to fighting against France during wartime. They also worried about whether their Mi'kmaq neighbours might perceive an oath as acknowledging the British claim to Acadia rather than that of the indigenous Mi'kmaq. Acadians believed that if they signed the oath, they might put their villages at risk of attack by the Mi'kmaq.<ref>{{cite book|last=Reid|first=John G.|title=Nova Scotia: A Pocket History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=D-69QAAACAAJ&pg=PA49|year=2009|publisher=Fernwood |isbn=978-1-55266-325-7|page=49}}</ref>\n\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile:Acadians 2, inset of painting by Samuel Scott of Annapolis Royal, 1751.jpg|Acadians at Annapolis Royal by [[Samuel Scott (painter)|Samuel Scott]], 1751, earliest image of Acadians; the only pre-deportation image of Acadians\nFile: Acadians, Inset of painting by Samuel Scott Annapolis Royal, 1751.jpg|Acadians by [[Samuel Scott (painter)|Samuel Scott]], Annapolis Royal, 1751\n</gallery>\n\n==Deportation==\n{{Main|Expulsion of the Acadians}}\n[[File:A View of the Plundering and Burning of the City of Grymross, by Thomas Davies, 1758.JPG|thumb|[[St. John River Campaign]]: ''A View of the Plundering and Burning of the City of Grimross'' (present-day [[Gagetown, New Brunswick]]) by [[Thomas Davies (British Army officer)|Thomas Davies]], 1758. This is the only contemporaneous image of the [[Expulsion of the Acadians]].]]\n\nIn the Great Expulsion (known by French speakers as ''le Grand D\u00e9rangement''), after the [[Battle of Fort Beaus\u00e9jour]] beginning in August 1755 under [[Charles Lawrence (British Army officer)|Lieutenant Governor Lawrence]], approximately 11,500 Acadians (three-quarters of the Acadian population in Nova Scotia) were expelled, their lands and property confiscated, and in some cases their homes burned. The Acadians were deported to separated locations throughout the British eastern seaboard colonies, from New England to Georgia. Although the British took measures during the embarkation of the Acadians to the transport ships, some families became split up.\n\nAfter 1758, thousands were transported to France. Most of the Acadians who later went to Louisiana sailed there from France on five Spanish ships. These had been provided by the Spanish Crown, which was eager to populate their Louisiana colony with Catholic settlers who might provide farmers to supply the needs of New Orleans residents. The Spanish had hired agents to seek out the dispossessed Acadians in Brittany, and kept this effort secret in order to avoid angering the French King. These new arrivals from France joined the earlier wave expelled from Acadia, and gradually their descendants developed the Cajun population (which included multiracial unions and children) and culture. They continued to be attached to French culture and language, and Catholicism.\n\n[[Image:Grand Pr\u00e9.JPG|thumb|left|Sculptor [[Louis-Philippe H\u00e9bert]]'s sculpture of [[Evangeline]] at the [[Grand-Pr\u00e9 National Historic Site]] in [[Nova Scotia]]]]\n\nThe Spanish offered the Acadians they had transported lowlands along the Mississippi River, in order to block British expansion from the East. Some would have preferred Western Louisiana, where many of their families and friends had settled. In addition, that land was more suitable to mixed crops of agriculture. Rebels among them marched to New Orleans and ousted the Spanish governor. The Spanish later sent infantry from other colonies to put down the rebellion and execute the leaders. After the rebellion in December 1769, the Spanish Governor O'Reilly permitted the Acadians who had settled across the river from [[Natchez, Louisiana|Natchez]] to resettle along the [[Iberville River|Iberville]] or [[Amite River|Amite]] rivers closer to [[New Orleans]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Holmes|first=Jack D.L.|title=A Guide to Spanish Louisiana, 1762-1806|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FfEvAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA5|year=1970|publisher=A. F. Laborde|page=5}}</ref>\n\nThe British conducted a second and smaller expulsion of Acadians after taking control of the North Shore of what is now [[New Brunswick]]. After the [[fall of Quebec]] and defeat of the French, the British lost interest in such relocations. Many Acadians gradually returned to [[British North America]], settling in coastal villages that were not occupied by colonists from New England. A few of the Acadians in this area had evaded the British for several years but the brutal winter weather eventually forced them to surrender. Some returnees settled in the region of Fort Sainte-Anne, now [[Fredericton]], but were later displaced when the Crown awarded land grants to numerous [[United Empire Loyalists]] from the Thirteen Colonies after the victory of the United States in the [[American Revolution]].\n\nIn 2003, at the request of Acadian representatives, [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II, Queen of Canada]] issued a [[Royal Proclamation of 2003|Royal Proclamation]] acknowledging the deportation. She established July 28 as an annual day of commemoration, beginning in 2005. The day is called the \"[[Great Upheaval]]\" on some English-language calendars.\n\n==Geography==\n[[Image:The Acadians.png|thumb|upright=1.2|Present-day Acadian communities]]\nThe Acadian descendants today live predominantly in the Canadian Maritime provinces, as well as parts of Quebec, Canada, and in Louisiana and Maine, United States. In New Brunswick, Acadians inhabit the northern and eastern shores of New Brunswick, from [[Miscou Island]] ({{lang-fr|link=no|\u00cele Miscou}}) [[\u00cele Lam\u00e8que]] including Caraquet in the center, to Neguac in the southern part, Grande-Anse in the eastern part and [[Campbellton, New Brunswick|Campbellton]] through to [[Saint-Quentin, New Brunswick|Saint-Quentin]] in the northern part. Other groups of Acadians can be found in the [[Magdalen Islands]] and throughout other parts of Quebec. Many ethnic Acadian descendants still live in and around the area of [[Madawaska, Maine]], where some of the Acadians first landed and settled in what is now known as the St. John Valley. There are also Acadians in Prince Edward Island and Nova Scotia, at [[Ch\u00e9ticamp]], [[Isle Madame]], and [[Clare, Nova Scotia|Clare]]. East and West [[Pubnico (village), Nova Scotia|Pubnico]], located at the end of the province, are the oldest regions that are predominantly ethnic Acadian.\n\nOther ethnic Acadians can be found in the southern and eastern regions of New Brunswick, Western Newfoundland and in New England. Many of these latter communities have assimilated to varying degrees into the majority culture of English speakers. For many families in predominantly [[English Language|Anglophone]] communities, French-[[language attrition]] has occurred, particularly in younger generations.\n\nThe Acadians who settled in [[Louisiana]] after 1764 became known as Cajuns for the culture they developed. They have had a dominant cultural influence in many [[Parish (subnational entity)|parishes]], particularly in the southwestern area of the state, which is known as [[Acadiana]].\n\n==Culture==\n[[File:Tintamarre during National Acadian Day 2009, Caraquet New Brunswick.jpg|thumb|The [[Tintamarre]] in [[Caraquet]], [[New Brunswick]]]]\n\nToday Acadians are a vibrant minority, particularly in New Brunswick and Nova Scotia, Canada, and in Louisiana (Cajuns) and northern Maine, United States. Since 1994, ''[[Le Congr\u00e8s Mondial Acadien]]'' has worked as an organization to unite this disparate communities and help preserve the culture.\n\nIn 1881, Acadians at the First Acadian National Convention, held in [[Memramcook, New Brunswick|Memramcook]], New Brunswick, designated August 15, the Christian feast of the [[Assumption of Mary]], as the [[National Acadian Day|national feast day]] of their community. On that day, the Acadians celebrate by having a ''[[tintamarre]],'' a big parade and procession for which people dress up with the colors of Acadia and make a lot of noise and music.\n\nThe [[national anthem]] of the Acadians is \"[[Ave Maris Stella]]\", adopted in 1884 at [[Miscouche]], Prince Edward Island. The anthem was revised at the 1992 meeting of the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Nationale de l'Acadie. The second, third and fourth verses were translated into [[French language|French]], with the first and last kept in the original [[Latin]].\n\nThe Federation des Associations de Familles Acadiennes of New Brunswick and the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Saint-Thomas d'Aquin of Prince Edward Island have resolved to commemorate December 13 annually as \"Acadian Remembrance Day,\" in memory of the sinking of the ''[[Duke William]]'' and of the nearly 2000 Acadians deported from Ile-Saint Jean who died in 1758 while being deported across the North Atlantic: from hunger, disease and drowning.<ref>''Pioneer Journal'', Summerside, Prince Edward Island, 9 December 2009.{{full citation needed|date=September 2016}}</ref> The event has been commemorated annually since 2004; participants mark the day by wearing a black star.\n\n==Representation in other media==\n* In the 21st century, cartoons and animated films have been produced that feature Acadian characters. In addition there is a TV show named ''[[Acadieman]].''\n\n===Legacy of The Expulsion===\n[[Image:Evangeline - Saint Martinville.jpg|thumb|upright|A statue of Longfellow's ''Evangeline'' \u2013 at [[St. Martinville, Louisiana|St. Martinville]], Louisiana.]]\n\n* American writer [[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow]] published ''[[Evangeline]]'', an epic poem loosely based on the 1755 deportation. The poem became an American classic. Activists used it as a catalyst in reviving a distinct  Acadian identity in both Maritime Canada and in Louisiana.\n* In the early 20th century, two statues were made of the fictional figure of \"Evangeline\" to commemorate the Expulsion: one was installed in [[St. Martinville, Louisiana]] and the other in [[Grand-Pr\u00e9, Nova Scotia]]. \n* Canadian musician [[Robbie Robertson]] wrote a popular song based on the Acadian Expulsion, entitled \"[[Acadian Driftwood]]\". It was a track on [[The Band]]'s 1975 album, ''[[Northern Lights \u2013 Southern Cross]]''.\n* [[Antonine Maillet]]'s novel ''[[P\u00e9lagie-la-charette]]'' concerns the return voyage to Acadia of several deported families, starting 15 years after the Great Expulsion.\n* The Acadian Memorial (Monument Acadien) has an eternal flame;<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.acadianmemorial.org/the-eternal-flame.php | title = Acadian Memorial - The Eternal Flame | access-date = October 18, 2012}}</ref> it honors the 3,000 Acadians who settled in Louisiana after the Expulsion.\n* Monuments to the Acadian Expulsion gave been erected at several sites in the Maritime Provinces, such as at [[Georges Island (Nova Scotia)|Georges Island]], Nova Scotia, and at [[Beaubears Island]].\n\n=== Flags ===\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| image1 = Flag of Acadiana.svg\n| width1 = 150\n| alt1 = Flag of the Acadiana region of Louisiana\n| caption1 = Flag of the Acadiana region of Louisiana\n| image2 = Flag of the New England Acadians.svg\n| width2 = 150\n| alt2 = Flag of the New England Acadians\n| caption2 = Flag of the [[New England]] Acadians\n| footer = \n}}\nThe [[Flag of Acadia|flag of the Acadians]] is the French [[drapeau tricolore|tricolour]], with the addition of a golden star in the blue field (see above).

This flag was adopted in 1884 at the Second Acadian National Convention, held in Miscouche, Prince Edward Island.\n\nAcadians in the diaspora have adopted other symbols. The flag of Acadians in Louisiana, known as Cajuns, was designed by Thomas J. Arceneaux of the [[University of Louisiana at Lafayette]]. In 1974 it was adopted by the Louisiana legislature as the official emblem of the [[Acadiana]] region.

Some Acadians were deported to England, to the Caribbean, and some were deported to France. After being expelled to France, many Acadians were eventually recruited by the Spanish government to migrate to present-day [[Louisiana]] (known then as Spanish colonial ''[[Louisiana (New Spain)|Luisiana]]''), under Spanish rule since the British victory in the Seven Years War.

The British prohibited them from resettling their lands and villages in what became Nova Scotia. Before the [[American Revolutionary War|US Revolutionary War]], the Crown settled Protestant European immigrants and [[New England Planters]] in former Acadian communities and farmland. After the war, it made land grants in Nova Scotia to Loyalists (including nearly 3,000 [[Black Loyalists]], [[freed slave|slaves of rebels]] given freedom after joining British forces). British policy was to establish a majority culture of Protestant religions, and to assimilate Acadians with the local populations where they resettled.<ref name=lock/>\n\nAcadians speak a variety of French called [[Acadian French]].

They developed friendly relations with the peoples of the [[Wabanaki Confederacy]] (particularly the regional [[Mi'kmaq people|Mi'kmaq]]), learning their hunting and fishing techniques developed for local conditions. The Acadians lived mainly in the coastal regions of the Bay of Fundy; they reclaimed farming land from the sea through building dikes to control water and drain certain wetlands. Living in a contested borderland region between French Canada (modern Quebec) and the British territories on New England and the coast, the Acadians often became entangled in the conflict between the powers. Their competition in Europe played out in North America as well. Over a period of seventy-four years, six wars took place in Acadia and Nova Scotia, in which the Confederacy and some Acadians fought to keep the British from taking over the region (See the four [[French and Indian Wars]] as well as [[Father Rale's War]] and [[Father Le Loutre's War]]).\n\nWhile France lost political control of Acadia in 1713, the M\u00ed'kmaq did not concede land to the British. Along with some Acadians, the Mi'kmaq from time to time used military force to resist the British.  That was particularly evident in the early 1720s during [[Dummer's War]], but hostilities were brought to a close by a treaty signed in 1726.\n\nThe British had conquered Acadia in 1710. Over the next 45 years, the Acadians refused to sign an unconditional oath of allegiance to Britain. Many were influenced by Father [[Jean-Louis Le Loutre]], who from his arrival in 1738 until his capture in 1755, preached against the 'English devils'.<ref>{{cite book|last=Parkman|first=Francis|authorlink=Francis Parkman|title=Montcalm and Wolfe|url=https://archive.org/details/montcalmandwolf08parkgoog|series=France and England in North America|year=1914|publisher=Little, Brown|orig-year=1884}}</ref> Acadians took part in various militia operations against the British and maintained vital supply lines to the French [[Fortress of Louisbourg]] and [[Fort Beausejour]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Grenier|first=John|title=The Far Reaches of Empire: War in Nova Scotia, 1710\u20131760|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TXoCBQAAQBAJ&pg=PP1|year=2008|publisher=University of Oklahoma Press|isbn=978-0-8061-8566-8}}</ref> During the [[French and Indian War]], the British sought to neutralize any military threat posed by the Acadians and to interrupt the vital supply lines which they provided to Louisbourg by deporting Acadians from Acadia.<ref>{{cite book |last=Patterson |first=Stephen E. |chapter=Indian-White Relations in Nova Scotia, 1749\u201361: A Study in Political Interaction |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jnxIPgAACAAJ&pg=PA105 |editor1-last=Buckner |editor1-first=Phillip Alfred |editor2-last=Campbell |editor2-first=Gail Grace |editor3-last=Frank |editor3-first=David |title=The Acadiensis Reader: Atlantic Canada Before Confederation |date=1998 |pages=105\u2013106}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Patterson|first=Stephen E.|chapter=1744\u20131763: Colonial Wars and Aboriginal Peoples|editor1=Phillip Buckner|editor2=John G.

During the French and Indian War, the Mi'kmaq assisted the Acadians in resisting the British during the [[Expulsion of the Acadians]].{{sfnp|Faragher|2005|pp=110\u2013112}}\n\nMany Acadians might have signed an unconditional oath to the British monarchy had the circumstances been better, while other Acadians would not sign because they were anti-British. The French and British competition had a long history, including opposing Christian established religions: Catholic in France and its colonies, and Protestant (Anglican) in England.<ref>For the best account of Acadian armed resistance to the British, see Grenier, John. ''The Far Reaches of Empire. War in Nova Scotia, 1710-1760.'' Norman: U of Oklahoma P, 2008.</ref> Acadians had numerous reasons against signing an oath of loyalty to the British Crown. As noted, the British monarch was the head of the (Protestant) Anglican Church of England. Acadian men feared that signing the oath would commit them to fighting against France during wartime. They also worried about whether their Mi'kmaq neighbours might perceive an oath as acknowledging the British claim to Acadia rather than that of the indigenous Mi'kmaq. Acadians believed that if they signed the oath, they might put their villages at risk of attack by the Mi'kmaq.<ref>{{cite book|last=Reid|first=John G.|title=Nova Scotia: A Pocket History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=D-69QAAACAAJ&pg=PA49|year=2009|publisher=Fernwood |isbn=978-1-55266-325-7|page=49}}</ref>\n\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile:Acadians 2, inset of painting by Samuel Scott of Annapolis Royal, 1751.jpg|Acadians at Annapolis Royal by [[Samuel Scott (painter)|Samuel Scott]], 1751, earliest image of Acadians; the only pre-deportation image of Acadians\nFile: Acadians, Inset of painting by Samuel Scott Annapolis Royal, 1751.jpg|Acadians by [[Samuel Scott (painter)|Samuel Scott]], Annapolis Royal, 1751\n</gallery>\n\n==Deportation==\n{{Main|Expulsion of the Acadians}}\n[[File:A View of the Plundering and Burning of the City of Grymross, by Thomas Davies, 1758.JPG|thumb|[[St. John River Campaign]]: ''A View of the Plundering and Burning of the City of Grimross'' (present-day [[Gagetown, New Brunswick]]) by [[Thomas Davies (British Army officer)|Thomas Davies]], 1758. This is the only contemporaneous image of the [[Expulsion of the Acadians]].]]\n\nIn the Great Expulsion (known by French speakers as ''le Grand D\u00e9rangement''), after the [[Battle of Fort Beaus\u00e9jour]] beginning in August 1755 under [[Charles Lawrence (British Army officer)|Lieutenant Governor Lawrence]], approximately 11,500 Acadians (three-quarters of the Acadian population in Nova Scotia) were expelled, their lands and property confiscated, and in some cases their homes burned. The Acadians were deported to separated locations throughout the British eastern seaboard colonies, from New England to Georgia. Although the British took measures during the embarkation of the Acadians to the transport ships, some families became split up.\n\nAfter 1758, thousands were transported to France. Most of the Acadians who later went to Louisiana sailed there from France on five Spanish ships. These had been provided by the Spanish Crown, which was eager to populate their Louisiana colony with Catholic settlers who might provide farmers to supply the needs of New Orleans residents. The Spanish had hired agents to seek out the dispossessed Acadians in Brittany, and kept this effort secret in order to avoid angering the French King. These new arrivals from France joined the earlier wave expelled from Acadia, and gradually their descendants developed the Cajun population (which included multiracial unions and children) and culture. They continued to be attached to French culture and language, and Catholicism.\n\n[[Image:Grand Pr\u00e9.JPG|thumb|left|Sculptor [[Louis-Philippe H\u00e9bert]]'s sculpture of [[Evangeline]] at the [[Grand-Pr\u00e9 National Historic Site]] in [[Nova Scotia]]]]\n\nThe Spanish offered the Acadians they had transported lowlands along the Mississippi River, in order to block British expansion from the East. Some would have preferred Western Louisiana, where many of their families and friends had settled. In addition, that land was more suitable to mixed crops of agriculture. Rebels among them marched to New Orleans and ousted the Spanish governor. The Spanish later sent infantry from other colonies to put down the rebellion and execute the leaders. After the rebellion in December 1769, the Spanish Governor O'Reilly permitted the Acadians who had settled across the river from [[Natchez, Louisiana|Natchez]] to resettle along the [[Iberville River|Iberville]] or [[Amite River|Amite]] rivers closer to [[New Orleans]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Holmes|first=Jack D.L.|title=A Guide to Spanish Louisiana, 1762-1806|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FfEvAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA5|year=1970|publisher=A. F. Laborde|page=5}}</ref>\n\nThe British conducted a second and smaller expulsion of Acadians after taking control of the North Shore of what is now [[New Brunswick]]. After the [[fall of Quebec]] and defeat of the French, the British lost interest in such relocations. Many Acadians gradually returned to [[British North America]], settling in coastal villages that were not occupied by colonists from New England. A few of the Acadians in this area had evaded the British for several years but the brutal winter weather eventually forced them to surrender. Some returnees settled in the region of Fort Sainte-Anne, now [[Fredericton]], but were later displaced when the Crown awarded land grants to numerous [[United Empire Loyalists]] from the Thirteen Colonies after the victory of the United States in the [[American Revolution]].\n\nIn 2003, at the request of Acadian representatives, [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II, Queen of Canada]] issued a [[Royal Proclamation of 2003|Royal Proclamation]] acknowledging the deportation. She established July 28 as an annual day of commemoration, beginning in 2005. The day is called the \"[[Great Upheaval]]\" on some English-language calendars.\n\n==Geography==\n[[Image:The Acadians.png|thumb|upright=1.2|Present-day Acadian communities]]\nThe Acadian descendants today live predominantly in the Canadian Maritime provinces, as well as parts of Quebec, Canada, and in Louisiana and Maine, United States. In New Brunswick, Acadians inhabit the northern and eastern shores of New Brunswick, from [[Miscou Island]] ({{lang-fr|link=no|\u00cele Miscou}}) [[\u00cele Lam\u00e8que]] including Caraquet in the center, to Neguac in the southern part, Grande-Anse in the eastern part and [[Campbellton, New Brunswick|Campbellton]] through to [[Saint-Quentin, New Brunswick|Saint-Quentin]] in the northern part. Other groups of Acadians can be found in the [[Magdalen Islands]] and throughout other parts of Quebec. Many ethnic Acadian descendants still live in and around the area of [[Madawaska, Maine]], where some of the Acadians first landed and settled in what is now known as the St. John Valley. There are also Acadians in Prince Edward Island and Nova Scotia, at [[Ch\u00e9ticamp]], [[Isle Madame]], and [[Clare, Nova Scotia|Clare]]. East and West [[Pubnico (village), Nova Scotia|Pubnico]], located at the end of the province, are the oldest regions that are predominantly ethnic Acadian.\n\nOther ethnic Acadians can be found in the southern and eastern regions of New Brunswick, Western Newfoundland and in New England. Many of these latter communities have assimilated to varying degrees into the majority culture of English speakers. For many families in predominantly [[English Language|Anglophone]] communities, French-[[language attrition]] has occurred, particularly in younger generations.\n\nThe Acadians who settled in [[Louisiana]] after 1764 became known as Cajuns for the culture they developed. They have had a dominant cultural influence in many [[Parish (subnational entity)|parishes]], particularly in the southwestern area of the state, which is known as [[Acadiana]].\n\n==Culture==\n[[File:Tintamarre during National Acadian Day 2009, Caraquet New Brunswick.jpg|thumb|The [[Tintamarre]] in [[Caraquet]], [[New Brunswick]]]]\n\nToday Acadians are a vibrant minority, particularly in New Brunswick and Nova Scotia, Canada, and in Louisiana (Cajuns) and northern Maine, United States. Since 1994, ''[[Le Congr\u00e8s Mondial Acadien]]'' has worked as an organization to unite this disparate communities and help preserve the culture.\n\nIn 1881, Acadians at the First Acadian National Convention, held in [[Memramcook, New Brunswick|Memramcook]], New Brunswick, designated August 15, the Christian feast of the [[Assumption of Mary]], as the [[National Acadian Day|national feast day]] of their community. On that day, the Acadians celebrate by having a ''[[tintamarre]],'' a big parade and procession for which people dress up with the colors of Acadia and make a lot of noise and music.\n\nThe [[national anthem]] of the Acadians is \"[[Ave Maris Stella]]\", adopted in 1884 at [[Miscouche]], Prince Edward Island. The anthem was revised at the 1992 meeting of the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Nationale de l'Acadie. The second, third and fourth verses were translated into [[French language|French]], with the first and last kept in the original [[Latin]].\n\nThe Federation des Associations de Familles Acadiennes of New Brunswick and the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Saint-Thomas d'Aquin of Prince Edward Island have resolved to commemorate December 13 annually as \"Acadian Remembrance Day,\" in memory of the sinking of the ''[[Duke William]]'' and of the nearly 2000 Acadians deported from Ile-Saint Jean who died in 1758 while being deported across the North Atlantic: from hunger, disease and drowning.<ref>''Pioneer Journal'', Summerside, Prince Edward Island, 9 December 2009.{{full citation needed|date=September 2016}}</ref> The event has been commemorated annually since 2004; participants mark the day by wearing a black star.\n\n==Representation in other media==\n* In the 21st century, cartoons and animated films have been produced that feature Acadian characters. In addition there is a TV show named ''[[Acadieman]].''\n\n===Legacy of The Expulsion===\n[[Image:Evangeline - Saint Martinville.jpg|thumb|upright|A statue of Longfellow's ''Evangeline'' \u2013 at [[St. Martinville, Louisiana|St. Martinville]], Louisiana.]]\n\n* American writer [[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow]] published ''[[Evangeline]]'', an epic poem loosely based on the 1755 deportation. The poem became an American classic. Activists used it as a catalyst in reviving a distinct  Acadian identity in both Maritime Canada and in Louisiana.\n* In the early 20th century, two statues were made of the fictional figure of \"Evangeline\" to commemorate the Expulsion: one was installed in [[St. Martinville, Louisiana]] and the other in [[Grand-Pr\u00e9, Nova Scotia]]. \n* Canadian musician [[Robbie Robertson]] wrote a popular song based on the Acadian Expulsion, entitled \"[[Acadian Driftwood]]\". It was a track on [[The Band]]'s 1975 album, ''[[Northern Lights \u2013 Southern Cross]]''.\n* [[Antonine Maillet]]'s novel ''[[P\u00e9lagie-la-charette]]'' concerns the return voyage to Acadia of several deported families, starting 15 years after the Great Expulsion.\n* The Acadian Memorial (Monument Acadien) has an eternal flame;<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.acadianmemorial.org/the-eternal-flame.php | title = Acadian Memorial - The Eternal Flame | access-date = October 18, 2012}}</ref> it honors the 3,000 Acadians who settled in Louisiana after the Expulsion.\n* Monuments to the Acadian Expulsion gave been erected at several sites in the Maritime Provinces, such as at [[Georges Island (Nova Scotia)|Georges Island]], Nova Scotia, and at [[Beaubears Island]].\n\n=== Flags ===\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| image1 = Flag of Acadiana.svg\n| width1 = 150\n| alt1 = Flag of the Acadiana region of Louisiana\n| caption1 = Flag of the Acadiana region of Louisiana\n| image2 = Flag of the New England Acadians.svg\n| width2 = 150\n| alt2 = Flag of the New England Acadians\n| caption2 = Flag of the [[New England]] Acadians\n| footer = \n}}\nThe [[Flag of Acadia|flag of the Acadians]] is the French [[drapeau tricolore|tricolour]], with the addition of a golden star in the blue field (see above). This symbolizes Saint [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]], Our Lady of the Assumption, [[patron saint]] of the Acadians and widely known as the \"[[Our Lady, Star of the Sea|Star of the Sea]]\". This flag was adopted in 1884 at the Second Acadian National Convention, held in Miscouche, Prince Edward Island.\n\nAcadians in the diaspora have adopted other symbols. The flag of Acadians in Louisiana, known as Cajuns, was designed by Thomas J. Arceneaux of the [[University of Louisiana at Lafayette]]. In 1974 it was adopted by the Louisiana legislature as the official emblem of the [[Acadiana]] region.

The Apertura tournament will be played in the second half of 2019, while the Clausura will be played in the first half of 2020.\n\nThe league is one of the few football leagues in the world that has not suspended their season due to the ongoing [[2020 coronavirus pandemic in Nicaragua|coronavirus pandemic]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Flores |first1=Omar |title=Mexicans players in Nicaragua play through coronavirus outbreak as fear, uncertainty linger |url=https://www.espn.com/soccer/mexico-mex/story/4079002/mexicans-players-in-nicaragua-play-through-coronavirus-outbreak-as-fearuncertainty-lingers |website=ESPN FC |accessdate=4 April 2020 |date=26 March 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Format==\nThe Apertura play-off format was changed from previous years, while the Clausura will use the same 4-team play-off format.

the history of the [[Liga Primera de Nicaragua]], the top division of [[association football|football]] in [[Nicaragua]]. The Apertura tournament will be played in the second half of 2019, while the Clausura will be played in the first half of 2020.\n\nThe league is one of the few football leagues in the world that has not suspended their season due to the ongoing [[2020 coronavirus pandemic in Nicaragua|coronavirus pandemic]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Flores |first1=Omar |title=Mexicans players in Nicaragua play through coronavirus outbreak as fear, uncertainty linger |url=https://www.espn.com/soccer/mexico-mex/story/4079002/mexicans-players-in-nicaragua-play-through-coronavirus-outbreak-as-fearuncertainty-lingers |website=ESPN FC |accessdate=4 April 2020 |date=26 March 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Format==\nThe Apertura play-off format was changed from previous years, while the Clausura will use the same 4-team play-off format. For the Apertura, the top four teams from the regular stage advanced to a \"quadrangular\" double-round robin instead of a play-off stage. The regular stage and quadrangular winners would have played to decide the tournament's champion, but ultimately the same team won both and the final was not necessary. The same format was recently adopted by the [[Costa Rican Primera Divisi\u00f3n]], but for both half seasons.\n\n== Team information ==\n\nA total of ten teams will contest the league, including eight sides from the [[2017\u201318 Primera Divisi\u00f3n de Nicaragua|2017\u201318 Primera Divisi\u00f3n]], and two sides from the [[2018\u201319 Segunda Divisi\u00f3n de F\u00fatbol Salvadore\u00f1o|2018\u201319 Segunda Divisi\u00f3n]].\n\n[[UNAN Managua]] finished last in the aggregate table and were relegated to the Segunda Divisi\u00f3n. The champions from the Segunda Divisi\u00f3n, [[Deportivo Las Sabanas]] were promoted in their place.\n\nThe 9th place team in the aggregate table, [[Chinandega FC]], faced the second place team from the Segunda Divisi\u00f3n, [[FC Guti\u00e9rrez]], in a playoff for a spot in the Primera Divisi\u00f3n. Chinandega won 4-3 over two legs, meaning Chinandega remained in Primera Divisi\u00f3n.\n\n=== Promotion and relegation ===\n\n'''Promoted from Segunda Divisi\u00f3n''' as of July, 2019.\n\n* Champions: [[Deportivo Las Sabanas]]\n\n\n'''Relegated to Segunda Divisi\u00f3n ''' as of July, 2019.\n\n* Last Place: [[UNAN Managua]]\n\n=== Stadia and locations ===\n{{location map+ |Nicaragua |width=440 |float=right |caption=Locations of the 2019\u201320 Liga Primera teams |places=\n{{location map~ |Nicaragua |lat=12.616667 |long=-87.15 |label_size=80 |label=[[Chinandega FC|Chinandega]]}}\n{{location map~ |Nicaragua |lat=13.35 |long=-86.616667 |label_size=80 |label=[[Deportivo Las Sabanas]]|position=left}}\n{{location map~ |Nicaragua |lat=13.633333 |long=-86.483333 |label_size=80 |label=[[Deportivo Ocotal]]}}\n{{location map~ |Nicaragua |lat=11.861111 |long=-86.243611 |label_size=80 |label=[[Diriang\u00e9n FC|Diriang\u00e9n]]}}\n{{location map~ |Nicaragua |lat=12.131667 |long=-86.285 |label_size=80 |label=[[Juventus Managua]]|position=left}}\n{{location map~ |Nicaragua |lat=12.131667 |long=-86.285 |label_size=80 |label=[[Managua FC|Managua]]}}\n{{location map~ |Nicaragua |lat=13.916667 |long=-86.133333 |label_size=80 |label=[[ART Municipal Jalapa|Municipal Jalapa]]|position=left}}\n{{location map~ |Nicaragua |lat=13.097778 |long=-86.353056 |label_size=80 |label=[[Real Estel\u00ed FC|Real Estel\u00ed]]|position=bottom}}\n{{location map~ |Nicaragua |lat=13.483333 |long=-86.583333 |label_size=80 |label=[[Real Madriz FC|Real Madriz]]|position=left}}\n{{location map~ |Nicaragua |lat=12.131667 |long=-86.285 |label_size=80 |label=[[C.D.

It was released as on [[contemporary hit radio]] on May 23 2000, after an [[Mastering (audio)|unmastered]] version was leaked. \"Doesn't Really Matter\" is a [[Pop music|pop]], [[contemporary R&B|R&B]] and [[Dance music|dance]] song that speaks about loving a person for who they are and disregarding their physical appearance. The track is based on an incomplete poem Jackson had written, which was later applied to her character in the film. The song was a contrast from the dark tone of her previous album ''[[The Velvet Rope]]'', returning to a brighter and more contemporary sound.\n\nThe song generally received positive reception, becoming Jackson's ninth number-one single in the United States after peaking on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] for three weeks. It was Jackson's 19th single to be [[Music recording certification|certified]] gold and the 13th best-selling single in 2000, selling over 600,000 copies in sales. It reached number five in the United Kingdom, where it attained a silver certification. The song peaked within the top 10 in Canada, Denmark, Poland, Italy, and Spain, as well as in the top 20 in Belgium, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, and Switzerland.\n\nThe [[music video]], directed by [[Joseph Kahn]], resembles an [[abstract art|abstract]], futuristic environment based on Japanese culture. In addition to scenes from the film, it also features futuristic technology, morphing clothes, and a dance sequence on a levitating platform. It had a reported cost of over $2.5 million, causing it to become one of the [[List of most expensive music videos|most expensive music videos]] of all time. [[Jenna Dewan]] made one of her earliest appearances in the video, performing as a dancer. She was later personally offered by Jackson to appear in the music video for \"[[All for You (Janet Jackson song)|All for You]]\", and perform as a dancer on the [[All for You Tour]].\n\n==Background and development==\n\"Doesn't Really Matter\" was written and produced by [[Janet Jackson]], [[Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis]] as the theme for the [[Universal Pictures]] film ''[[Nutty Professor II: The Klumps]]'', starring Jackson and actor [[Eddie Murphy]].<ref name=\"LinerNotes\">{{Cite AV media notes|title=Doesn't Really Matter|others=[[Janet Jackson]]|year=2000|type=booklet|publisher=[[Def Jam Records]]|id=314 562 846-2|location=New York City}}</ref> She portrays Professor Denise Gaines in the film, the love interest of [[The Nutty Professor (character)|Sherman Klump]], who is one of many characters portrayed by Murphy.<ref name=\"KlumpsMTV\">{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1428172/20000523/dmx.jhtml|title=LL, Sisqo, Jay-Z, Foxy, DMX, More For \"Klumps\"|website=[[MTV News]]|date=May 23, 2000|access-date=December 10, 2019}}</ref> When asked to contribute a single for the [[Nutty Professor II: The Klumps (soundtrack)|movie's soundtrack]], Jackson stated that she would consider if she found an appropriate song.<ref name=\"Bronson\">{{cite book|last=Bronson|first=Fred|year=2003|title=Billboard's Hottest Hot 100 Hits|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard Books]]|edition=3|page=902|isbn=0823077381}}</ref> The single would allow Jackson to continue releasing music, while simultaneously devoting time to her film career.<ref>{{cite book|date=July 21\u201323, 2000|title=Action Jackson|work=[[USA Weekend]]|page=6}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|date=November 2000|title=Janet at the Crossroads|work=[[Ebony (magazine)|Ebony]]|page=181}}</ref> To help inspire Jackson, director [[Peter Segal]] brought a rough cut of the film to Flyte Tyme Studios where the singer was recording her seventh album, ''[[All for You (Janet Jackson album)|All for You]]''.

Jackson presented three songs to Segal on May 12, 2000, three days prior to his set deadline for the soundtrack.

It was released as on [[contemporary hit radio]] on May 23 2000, after an [[Mastering (audio)|unmastered]] version was leaked. \"Doesn't Really Matter\" is a [[Pop music|pop]], [[contemporary R&B|R&B]] and [[Dance music|dance]] song that speaks about loving a person for who they are and disregarding their physical appearance. The track is based on an incomplete poem Jackson had written, which was later applied to her character in the film. The song was a contrast from the dark tone of her previous album ''[[The Velvet Rope]]'', returning to a brighter and more contemporary sound.\n\nThe song generally received positive reception, becoming Jackson's ninth number-one single in the United States after peaking on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] for three weeks. It was Jackson's 19th single to be [[Music recording certification|certified]] gold and the 13th best-selling single in 2000, selling over 600,000 copies in sales. It reached number five in the United Kingdom, where it attained a silver certification. The song peaked within the top 10 in Canada, Denmark, Poland, Italy, and Spain, as well as in the top 20 in Belgium, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, and Switzerland.\n\nThe [[music video]], directed by [[Joseph Kahn]], resembles an [[abstract art|abstract]], futuristic environment based on Japanese culture. In addition to scenes from the film, it also features futuristic technology, morphing clothes, and a dance sequence on a levitating platform. It had a reported cost of over $2.5 million, causing it to become one of the [[List of most expensive music videos|most expensive music videos]] of all time. [[Jenna Dewan]] made one of her earliest appearances in the video, performing as a dancer. She was later personally offered by Jackson to appear in the music video for \"[[All for You (Janet Jackson song)|All for You]]\", and perform as a dancer on the [[All for You Tour]].\n\n==Background and development==\n\"Doesn't Really Matter\" was written and produced by [[Janet Jackson]], [[Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis]] as the theme for the [[Universal Pictures]] film ''[[Nutty Professor II: The Klumps]]'', starring Jackson and actor [[Eddie Murphy]].<ref name=\"LinerNotes\">{{Cite AV media notes|title=Doesn't Really Matter|others=[[Janet Jackson]]|year=2000|type=booklet|publisher=[[Def Jam Records]]|id=314 562 846-2|location=New York City}}</ref> She portrays Professor Denise Gaines in the film, the love interest of [[The Nutty Professor (character)|Sherman Klump]], who is one of many characters portrayed by Murphy.<ref name=\"KlumpsMTV\">{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1428172/20000523/dmx.jhtml|title=LL, Sisqo, Jay-Z, Foxy, DMX, More For \"Klumps\"|website=[[MTV News]]|date=May 23, 2000|access-date=December 10, 2019}}</ref> When asked to contribute a single for the [[Nutty Professor II: The Klumps (soundtrack)|movie's soundtrack]], Jackson stated that she would consider if she found an appropriate song.<ref name=\"Bronson\">{{cite book|last=Bronson|first=Fred|year=2003|title=Billboard's Hottest Hot 100 Hits|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard Books]]|edition=3|page=902|isbn=0823077381}}</ref> The single would allow Jackson to continue releasing music, while simultaneously devoting time to her film career.<ref>{{cite book|date=July 21\u201323, 2000|title=Action Jackson|work=[[USA Weekend]]|page=6}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|date=November 2000|title=Janet at the Crossroads|work=[[Ebony (magazine)|Ebony]]|page=181}}</ref> To help inspire Jackson, director [[Peter Segal]] brought a rough cut of the film to Flyte Tyme Studios where the singer was recording her seventh album, ''[[All for You (Janet Jackson album)|All for You]]''.

The village has a population of 3,832, while Plandi\u0161te municipality has 11,336 inhabitants. One of municipality's best known landmarks is [[Kapetanovo Castle]], located in [[Stari Lec]].\n\n==Name==\nIn [[Serbian language|Serbian]], the village is known as \u041f\u043b\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0438\u0448\u0442\u0435 or ''Plandi\u0161te'', in [[Romanian language|Romanian]] as ''Plandi\u0219te'', in [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] as ''Zichyfalva'', in [[German language|German]] as ''Zichydorf'' {{IPA-de|Z\u026ad\u0292idorf|pron}} , and in {{lang-mk|\u041f\u043b\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0438\u0448\u0442\u0435}}.\n\nThe name of the village derived from the word ''plandovati'' used in the local Serbian dialect, which in modern standard Serbian means ''odmarati'', and in English means ''to rest''.\n\n==History==\n=== World Politics running over Banat for centuries ===\nBanat as part of [[Pannonia]] was under [[Roman Empire|Roman]] rule from 9 BC to the end of the 4th century.<ref>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungary#Before_895{{unreliable source?|date=April 2020}}</ref> In 5th century the [[Huns]] razed the land. In the 9th century, the Hungarian empire started its reign, and around 1000 AD the Banat became part of the prospering Hungarian empire. In the 13th century [[Genghis Khan]] invaded Europe. After the [[Battle of Moh\u00e1cs]] in 1526, the [[Ottoman|Turks]] took over two-thirds of Hungary, including Banat.\n\n=== Settlements before Zichydorf ===\nIn the municipal area of Plandi\u0161te have been several places in medieval times: Bioseg, Terjan, Sarkac and Raros. These names still exist on 18th-century maps <ref>https://mapire.eu/de/map/secondsurvey-hungary/embed/?bbox=2343817.2621939667%2C5657190.455042724%2C2362047.493439981%2C5662923.232164111&map-list=1&layers=5</ref>. \n\nAccording to Milleker<ref>http://zichydorf.ferienwohnung-otterberg.de/Zichydorf/geschichte.htm</ref> there were several different villages named Bioseg between 1375<ref>Pesti: Krasso, III, Nr. 86</ref> and 1550.<ref>Pesty: Krasso, IV, Nr. 405</ref> They were named O-Belzeg, Nagy-Belzeg und Pervan-Belzeg. The names mean: \n\n* Prefix ''bel-'' or ''bio-'' comes from Serbian ''belu'' which means white (compare to [[Belgrade]] / Beograd).\n* ''-zeg'' comes from Hungarian ''sziget'' meaning [[island]].\n* ''Pervan'' is Serbian and means ''first'', which is common at that time and area to distinguish different places of the same name: simply give numbers.\n* Milleker does not tell anything about ''O-''. Maybe it is nothing more than a guess: in German it is common to abbreviate ''Ober'' with ''O-'' meaning the village located on higher altitude.\n* ''Nagy'' is Hungarian and means ''big''.\n\nWhat happened to the villages during the reign of the Ottoman is unknown. When the Hungarians came back, of those villages only a few houses and the names were left. \n\nMilleker<ref>http://zichydorf.ferienwohnung-otterberg.de/Zichydorf/geschichte.htm</ref> talks about a [[legend]], that at the today location of Plandi\u0161te there had been a [[battle]] between [[Prince_Eugene_of_Savoy|Prince Eugene]] and the Ottoman Empire during the [[Great_Turkish_War|Great Turkish War (1683-1699)]] most likely around 1686 (TODO check). What remained was a graveyard, which was discovered in 1889 during the erection of the train line from [[Zrenjanin]] to [[Margita]]. He suggests that Romanian [[Shepherd]]s founded Mormin\u021b which means cemetery in Romanian and thus might refer to exactly this battle and graveyard.\n\nThe fact is, in 1713 the village Mormin\u021b existed at the location of Plandi\u0161te with a count of 23 houses. <ref>Glasnik Jahrgang V, Nr 10, S. 15 1</ref> After the [[Austro-Turkish_War_(1716\u20131718)|Austro-Turkish War (1716\u20131718)]], it counted only 8.<ref>Szenkl\u00e4ray: Sz\u00e4s ev, 1, 26</ref> In 1738 the Ottoman Turks struck back, destroying settlements along the Danube, including Mormin\u021b. The Turks advanced north over the next year, all the way to [[Temesvar]], the capital of Banat. After this invasion, the territory around Mormin\u021b was abandoned.<ref>Szenkl\u00e4ray: Sz\u00e4s Beilage 6, S. 5</ref>\n\n=== Austrians driving back the Ottoman ===\nThe Austrians and Hungarians joined forces and in 1738 pushed the Turks back south, across the Danube. The expulsion of the Turks brought organized settlement under the auspices of the Habsburg dynasty. Austro-Hungarian military campaigns were based on German nobility - Counts, who served as generals to the Imperial Austrian Army. It was custom for the Austrian [[Emperor|Kaiser]] to reward each count with a piece of land from the newly conquered Banat. So Count Carl Zichy de V\u00e1sonke\u00f6, at that time [[President (government title)|president]] of the Hungarian Parliament (check! Milleker calls it \"Kammer\", maybe https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hofkammer{{unreliable source?|date=April 2020}}), became the owner of about 10,000 [[acres]] (check, usually they counted in [[Austria|Austrian]] Katastraljoch which is 0.57 [[ha]]) of land in the Plandi\u0161te area. Since he did not earn much money from the [[lease]] of this land he decided to take part in the colonization effort.<ref>http://zichydorf.ferienwohnung-otterberg.de/Zichydorf/geschichte.htm</ref>\n\n=== Colonizing the Conquered Land ===\nIn 1782 [[Joseph_II,_Holy_Roman_Emperor|Emperor Joseph II]] started the third colonization into Banat which ended in 1787 <ref>https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schwabenzug#Dritter_gro%C3%9Fer_Schwabenzug_(1781%E2%80%931787){{unreliable source?|date=April 2020}}</ref>. Later, in winter 1787 and spring 1788 the colony Zichydorf was established.<ref>http://zichydorf.ferienwohnung-otterberg.de/Zichydorf/geschichte.htm</ref> So they settled it with people from German Banat villages instead: [[Graba\u021b]], [[Jimbolia]] (Hatzfeld), [[Comlo\u0219u Mic]] (Ostern), [[Iecea Mic\u0103]] (Klein-Jetscha) and [[Iecea Mare]] (Gro\u00df-Jetscha). The new settlement consisted of 123 houses owning 34 [[Katastraljoch]]<ref>https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alte_Ma%C3%9Fe_und_Gewichte_(%C3%96sterreich)#Fl%C3%A4chenma%C3%9Fe{{unreliable source?|date=April 2020}}</ref> (19,5 [[Hectare|ha]]) each. \n\nIn 1867 Austria adopted a dual monarchy known as the Austro-Hungarian Empire. The Hungarian authorities later forced [[Magyarization]] to create a special Hungarian nation from a mixed population, which was mostly German, but also included Hungarians, Romanians, Serbs, Turks and several other ethnics. Magyarization resulted in the name change from German to Hungarian. So Zichydorf was renamed to Zichyfalva or Zichyhaza. Also, the Hungarians built a lot of infrastructure like railroads and the [[Danube\u2013Tisa\u2013Danube Canal]].\n\n=== Modern times ===\nAfter the [[Treaty of Versailles]] in 1918 the new borders brought Zichyfalva into the state of Serbia, which became part of the newly formed [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]].

The village has a population of 3,832, while Plandi\u0161te municipality has 11,336 inhabitants. One of municipality's best known landmarks is [[Kapetanovo Castle]], located in [[Stari Lec]].\n\n==Name==\nIn [[Serbian language|Serbian]], the village is known as \u041f\u043b\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0438\u0448\u0442\u0435 or ''Plandi\u0161te'', in [[Romanian language|Romanian]] as ''Plandi\u0219te'', in [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] as ''Zichyfalva'', in [[German language|German]] as ''Zichydorf'' {{IPA-de|Z\u026ad\u0292idorf|pron}} , and in {{lang-mk|\u041f\u043b\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0438\u0448\u0442\u0435}}.\n\nThe name of the village derived from the word ''plandovati'' used in the local Serbian dialect, which in modern standard Serbian means ''odmarati'', and in English means ''to rest''.\n\n==History==\n=== World Politics running over Banat for centuries ===\nBanat as part of [[Pannonia]] was under [[Roman Empire|Roman]] rule from 9 BC to the end of the 4th century.<ref>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungary#Before_895{{unreliable source?|date=April 2020}}</ref> In 5th century the [[Huns]] razed the land. In the 9th century, the Hungarian empire started its reign, and around 1000 AD the Banat became part of the prospering Hungarian empire. In the 13th century [[Genghis Khan]] invaded Europe. After the [[Battle of Moh\u00e1cs]] in 1526, the [[Ottoman|Turks]] took over two-thirds of Hungary, including Banat.\n\n=== Settlements before Zichydorf ===\nIn the municipal area of Plandi\u0161te have been several places in medieval times: Bioseg, Terjan, Sarkac and Raros. These names still exist on 18th-century maps <ref>https://mapire.eu/de/map/secondsurvey-hungary/embed/?bbox=2343817.2621939667%2C5657190.455042724%2C2362047.493439981%2C5662923.232164111&map-list=1&layers=5</ref>. \n\nAccording to Milleker<ref>http://zichydorf.ferienwohnung-otterberg.de/Zichydorf/geschichte.htm</ref> there were several different villages named Bioseg between 1375<ref>Pesti: Krasso, III, Nr. 86</ref> and 1550.<ref>Pesty: Krasso, IV, Nr. 405</ref> They were named O-Belzeg, Nagy-Belzeg und Pervan-Belzeg. The names mean: \n\n* Prefix ''bel-'' or ''bio-'' comes from Serbian ''belu'' which means white (compare to [[Belgrade]] / Beograd).\n* ''-zeg'' comes from Hungarian ''sziget'' meaning [[island]].\n* ''Pervan'' is Serbian and means ''first'', which is common at that time and area to distinguish different places of the same name: simply give numbers.\n* Milleker does not tell anything about ''O-''. Maybe it is nothing more than a guess: in German it is common to abbreviate ''Ober'' with ''O-'' meaning the village located on higher altitude.\n* ''Nagy'' is Hungarian and means ''big''.\n\nWhat happened to the villages during the reign of the Ottoman is unknown. When the Hungarians came back, of those villages only a few houses and the names were left. \n\nMilleker<ref>http://zichydorf.ferienwohnung-otterberg.de/Zichydorf/geschichte.htm</ref> talks about a [[legend]], that at the today location of Plandi\u0161te there had been a [[battle]] between [[Prince_Eugene_of_Savoy|Prince Eugene]] and the Ottoman Empire during the [[Great_Turkish_War|Great Turkish War (1683-1699)]] most likely around 1686{{cn|date=April 2020}}<!-- (TODO check)-->. What remained was a graveyard, which was discovered in 1889 during the erection of the train line from [[Zrenjanin]] to [[Margita]]. He suggests that Romanian [[Shepherd]]s founded Mormin\u021b which means cemetery in Romanian and thus might refer to exactly this battle and graveyard.\n\nThe fact is, in 1713 the village Mormin\u021b existed at the location of Plandi\u0161te with a count of 23 houses. <ref>Glasnik Jahrgang V, Nr 10, S. 15 1</ref> After the [[Austro-Turkish_War_(1716\u20131718)|Austro-Turkish War (1716\u20131718)]], it counted only 8.<ref>Szenkl\u00e4ray: Sz\u00e4s ev, 1, 26</ref> In 1738 the Ottoman Turks struck back, destroying settlements along the Danube, including Mormin\u021b. The Turks advanced north over the next year, all the way to [[Temesvar]], the capital of Banat. After this invasion, the territory around Mormin\u021b was abandoned.<ref>Szenkl\u00e4ray: Sz\u00e4s Beilage 6, S. 5</ref>\n\n=== Austrians driving back the Ottoman ===\nThe Austrians and Hungarians joined forces and in 1738 pushed the Turks back south, across the Danube. The expulsion of the Turks brought organized settlement under the auspices of the Habsburg dynasty. Austro-Hungarian military campaigns were based on German nobility - Counts, who served as generals to the Imperial Austrian Army. It was custom for the Austrian [[Emperor|Kaiser]] to reward each count with a piece of land from the newly conquered Banat. So Count Carl Zichy de V\u00e1sonke\u00f6, at that time [[President (government title)|president]] of the Hungarian Parliament<!-- (check! Milleker calls it \"Kammer\", maybe https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hofkammer{{unreliable source?|date=April 2020}})-->, became the owner of about 10,000 [[acres]]<!-- (check, usually they counted in [[Austrian]] Katastraljoch which is 0.57 [[ha]])--> of land in the Plandi\u0161te area. Since he did not earn much money from the [[lease]] of this land he decided to take part in the colonization effort.<ref>http://zichydorf.ferienwohnung-otterberg.de/Zichydorf/geschichte.htm</ref>\n\n=== Colonizing the Conquered Land ===\nIn 1782 [[Joseph_II,_Holy_Roman_Emperor|Emperor Joseph II]] started the third colonization into Banat which ended in 1787 <ref>https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schwabenzug#Dritter_gro%C3%9Fer_Schwabenzug_(1781%E2%80%931787){{unreliable source?|date=April 2020}}</ref>. Later, in winter 1787 and spring 1788 the colony Zichydorf was established.<ref>http://zichydorf.ferienwohnung-otterberg.de/Zichydorf/geschichte.htm</ref> So they settled it with people from German Banat villages instead: [[Graba\u021b]], [[Jimbolia]] (Hatzfeld), [[Comlo\u0219u Mic]] (Ostern), [[Iecea Mic\u0103]] (Klein-Jetscha) and [[Iecea Mare]] (Gro\u00df-Jetscha). The new settlement consisted of 123 houses owning 34 [[Katastraljoch]]<ref>https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alte_Ma%C3%9Fe_und_Gewichte_(%C3%96sterreich)#Fl%C3%A4chenma%C3%9Fe{{unreliable source?|date=April 2020}}</ref> (19,5 [[Hectare|ha]]) each. \n\nIn 1867 Austria adopted a dual monarchy known as the Austro-Hungarian Empire. The Hungarian authorities later forced [[Magyarization]] to create a special Hungarian nation from a mixed population, which was mostly German, but also included Hungarians, Romanians, Serbs, Turks and several other ethnics. Magyarization resulted in the name change from German to Hungarian. So Zichydorf was renamed to Zichyfalva or Zichyhaza. Also, the Hungarians built a lot of infrastructure like railroads and the [[Danube\u2013Tisa\u2013Danube Canal]].\n\n=== Modern times ===\nAfter the [[Treaty of Versailles]] in 1918 the new borders brought Zichyfalva into the state of Serbia, which became part of the newly formed [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]]. [[Alexander I of Yugoslavia]] proclaimed the change of all place names to Serbian and so it was named Mariolana.\n\nDuring the German occupation in the [[Second World War]] the names of the settlements were returned to the German original names. Afterwards the place got its present name Plandi\u0161te. The German population was expelled under harsh conditions. Immigrants from other parts of the country arrived on the territory of the municipality, so that 18 ethnicities were represented in the again multi-ethnic population structure.\n\n==Inhabited places==\nPlandi\u0161te municipality includes the following villages:\n*Plandi\u0161te\n*[[Banatski Sokolac]]\n*[[Barice, Plandi\u0161te|Barice]]\n*[[Velika Greda]]\n*[[Veliki Gaj]]\n*[[Du\u017eine]]\n*[[Jermenovci]]\n*[[Kupinik (Plandi\u0161te)|Kupinik]]\n*[[Laudonovac]]\n*[[Margita (Plandi\u0161te)|Margita]]\n*[[Markovi\u0107evo]]\n*[[Mileti\u0107evo]]\n*[[Stari Lec]]\n*[[Hajdu\u010dica]]\n\n==Demographics==\nHistorical population of the village:\n{{historical populations\n|align=none\n| cols = 2\n|1869|2,937\n|1880|2,636\n|1890|3,128\n|1900|3,192\n|1910|2,846\n|1921|3,120\n|1931|3,281\n|1948|3,040\n|1953|3,096\n|1961|3,509\n|1971|3,769\n|1981|4,122\n}}\n\n===Ethnic groups===\n;Municipality\n{{See also|Serbs in Vojvodina|Hungarians in Vojvodina|Macedonians in Serbia|Romani people of Vojvodina|Romanians in Vojvodina|Slovaks in Vojvodina|Serbian lands|List of Hungarian communities in Vojvodina}}\nAccording to the 2011 census, the municipality of Plandi\u0161te had a total population of 11,336, including:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://webrzs.stat.gov.rs/WebSite/Public/ReportResultView.aspx?rptKey=indId%3d18020101IND01%26102%3d80349%2636%3d0%2cG%2cO%2623%3d0%26111%3d01%2c02%2c03%2c04%2c05%2c06%2c07%2c08%2c09%2c10%2c11%2c12%2c13%2c14%2c15%2c16%2c17%2c18%2c19%2c20%2c21%2c22%2c23%2c24%2c25%2c26%26sAreaId%3d18020101%26dType%3dIdentificatorAndName%26lType%3dEnglish|title=Population by ethnicity \u2013 Plandi\u0161te|publisher=Statistical Office of the Republic of Serbia (SORS)|accessdate=4 March 2013}}</ref>\n\n*5,868 [[Serbs]] (51.76%)\n*1,280 [[Magyars|Hungarians]] (11.29%)\n*1,042 [[Macedonians (ethnic group)|Macedonians]] (9.19%)\n*784 [[Romanians]] (7.92%)\n*616 [[Slovaks]] (5.43%)\n*281 [[Romani people|Romani]] (2.48%)\n*1,465 Others and undeclared (12.92%)\n\nSettlements with '''Serb''' ethnic majority are: Plandi\u0161te, [[Banatski Sokolac]], [[Velika Greda]], [[Veliki Gaj]], [[Du\u017eine]], [[Kupinik (Plandi\u0161te)|Kupinik]], [[Laudonovac]], [[Markovi\u0107evo]], [[Mileti\u0107evo]], and [[Stari Lec]].
