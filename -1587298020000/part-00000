As a former resident of Manchester club, [[The Ha\u00e7ienda]], he is widely regarded as one of the most influential figures of the early UK house scene.\n\n== Hacienda residency and DJ career ==\nAfter graduating in Film and History from the University of Kent, Jon moved to Manchester. His mixing skills and innovative style were quickly noticed and he was soon offered a residency at legendary Manchester club, Fac 51 The Hacienda. Dasilva and DJ [[Mike Pickering]] started the wildly popular Ibiza-inspired HOT nights, which are seen by many as the birthplace of UK [[acid house]], alongside [[Danny Rampling]]'s Shoom.\n\nDuring his residency at The Hacienda, he became well known for his use of a cappella vocals and sound effects. Such techniques influenced a new generation of young DJs, including [[Sasha (DJ)|Sasha]], who credits Dasilva for teaching him how to mix harmonically and build sets.\n\nSince leaving The Hacienda, Dasilva's career has taken him around the world. He was the first guest DJ to be booked by Slam (Soma Records) in Glasgow back in 1989, first UK DJ to play Tresor in Berlin around 1990. He was also one of the first British DJs to play China in the mid-90s, and was resident on the first Strictly Rhythm Records Tour alongside Todd Terry and a young Roger Sanchez. Since 2015 he has been one of the resident DJs at 'I Love Acid', currently the longest running dedicated, regular Acid House clubnight in the UK (established 2007) and winner of DJ Mag's Best Club Event 2019 award.\n\n<br />\n\n== Production ==\nJon has remixed for bands such as; New Fast Automatic Daffodils, [[New Order (band)|New Order]], [[A Certain Ratio]], [[Inspiral Carpets]] and [[M People]], and has released productions on labels including Ellum Audio, Rush Hour, Soma, Mute, Deconstruction, Better Days, Eskimo, DMC and many others. \n\nSome release highlights include \"Soul On Ice\" featuring [[Rowetta]] from the Happy Mondays on vocals, \"Hot\" by Ideal, Jon's most successful solo project to date and Jon's blistering remix of Screen IIs, \"Hey Mr. DJ\", on Cleveland City Records. Jon was signed to Cleveland City for some years.\n\nIn 2013, Jon collaborated with [[Maceo Plex]] to produce \"Love Somebody Else\" which won \"Best House Track\" that year at the International Dance Awards in Miami.

The interviewer asks questions to which the interviewee responds, usually so information is offered by the interviewee to interviewer -- and that information may be used or provided to other audiences, whether in real time or later. This feature is common to many types of interviews -- a job interview or interview with a witness to an event may have no other audience present at the time, but the answers will be later provided to others in the employment or investigative process. \n\nThe \"information\" or answers may also be transferred in both directions in a tradition interview.\n\nInterviews usually take place face-to-face and in person, although modern communications technologies such as the Internet have enabled conversations to happen in which parties are separated geographically, such as with [[videoconferencing]] software,<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.brandeis.edu/hiatt/howto/interview/index.html |title= Introduction to Interviewing |publisher= [[Brandeis University]] |accessdate= 2015-05-02}}</ref> and [[telephone interview]]s can happen without visual contact. Interviews almost always involve spoken conversation between two or more parties, although in some instances a \"conversation\" can happen between two persons who type questions and answers back and forth. \n\nInterviews can range from Unstructured interview or free-wheeling and open-ended conversations in which there is no predetermined plan with prearranged questions,<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=3OdBAAAAIAAJ&dq=frontiers+of+guidance+Non-directive+counselling+as+an+effective+technique&q=Non-directive+counselling+as+an+effective+technique|title=Frontier Thinking in Guidance|last1=Rogers|first1=Carl R.|date=1945|publisher=Science research associates|location=University of California|pages=105\u2013112|accessdate=March 18, 2015}}</ref> to highly [[structured interview|structured]] conversations in which specific questions occur in a specified order.<ref>[http://www.sagepub.com/booksProdDesc.nav?prodId=Book226668 Kvale & Brinkman. 2008.

Interviews have a duration in time, in the sense that the interview has a beginning and an ending.\n\nThe traditional two-person interview format, sometimes called a one-on-one interview, permits direct questions and followups, which enables an interviewer to better gauge the accuracy of responses. It is a flexible arrangement in the sense that subsequent questions can be tailored to clarify earlier answers. Further, it eliminates any possible distortion by having third parties present.\n\nFace to face interviewing makes it easier for people to interact and form a connection, and it helps both the potential employer and potential hire who they might be interacting with.<ref name=SS1> Snap Surveys, [https://www.snapsurveys.com/blog/advantages-disadvantages-facetoface-data-collection/ Advantages and disadvantages of face to face data collection], Retrieved April 27, 2018</ref> Further, face to face interview sessions can be more enjoyable.<ref name=SS1/>\n\n== Contexts ==\nInterviews can happen in a wide variety of contexts:\n\n'''Employment'''. Interviews in an employment context are typically called [[job interview]]s which describe a formal consultation for the purpose of evaluating the qualifications of the interviewee for a specific position.<ref name = \"Dipboye et al\">Dipboye, R. L., Macan, T., & Shahani-Denning, C. (2012). The selection interview from the interviewer and applicant perspectives: Can't have one without the other. In N.

Sometimes the interviews happen in several waves, with the first interview sometimes being called a ''screening interview'' which is a shorter length interview, followed by more in-depth interviews later on, usually by company personnel who can ultimately hire the applicant. Technology has enabled new possibilities for interviewing; for example, video phoning technology has enabled applicants to interview for jobs despite being in different cities or countries than the interviewer. \n\n'''Psychology'''. Psychologists use a variety of interviewing methods and techniques to try to understand and help their patients. In a [[psychiatric interview]], a psychiatrist or psychologist or nurse asks a battery of questions to complete what is called a [[psychiatric assessment]]. Sometimes two people are interviewed by an interviewer, with one format being called [[couple interview]]s.<ref name=\"P-G-2015\">{{cite journal|last1=Polak|first1=L|last2=Green|first2=J|year=2015|title=Using Joint Interviews to Add Analytic Value|url=https://kclpure.kcl.ac.uk/portal/en/publications/using-joint-interviews-to-add-analytic-value(dfe3fe1b-df7e-43f9-b6a1-6ed14f8300f1).html|journal=[[Qualitative Health Research]]|volume=26|issue=12|pages=1638\u201348|doi=10.1177/1049732315580103|pmid=25850721}}</ref> Criminologists and detectives sometimes use [[cognitive interview]]s on eyewitnesses and victims to try to ascertain what can be recalled specifically from a crime scene, hopefully before the specific memories begin to fade in the mind.<ref name = \"Memon,Cronin,Eaves,Bull\">Memon, A., Cronin, O., Eaves, R., Bull, R.

In [[marketing research]] and [[academic research]], interviews are used in a wide variety of ways as a method to do extensive personality tests. [[Interview (research)|Interviews]] are often used in [[qualitative research]] in which firms try to understand how consumers think. Consumer research firms sometimes use [[computer-assisted telephone interviewing]] to randomly dial phone numbers to conduct highly structured telephone interviews, with scripted questions and responses entered directly into the computer.<ref name=\"uslabor\">{{cite web|url=http://www.bls.gov/bls/glossary.htm|title=BLS Information |date=February 28, 2008|work=Glossary|publisher=U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics Division of Information Services |accessdate=2009-05-05}}</ref>\n\n'''Journalism and other media'''. Typically, reporters covering a story in [[journalism]] conduct [[Interview (journalism)|interviews]] over the phone and in person to gain information for subsequent publication. Reporters also interview government officials and political candidates for broadcast.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=OQusAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA1&lpg=PA1&dq=news+interview+invented#v=onepage|title=Interviewing for Radio|last=Beaman|first=Jim|date=2011-04-14|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-85007-3|language=en}}</ref> In a [[talk show]], a radio or television \"host\" interviews one or more people, with the topic usually chosen by the host, sometimes for the purposes of [[entertainment]], sometimes for informational purposes.  Such interviews are often recorded.  \n\n'''Other situations'''. Sometimes college representatives or alumni conduct [[college interview]]s with prospective students as a way of assessing a student's suitability while offering the student a chance to learn more about a college.<ref name=\"twsBostonGlobe4\"/> Some services specialize in coaching people for interviews.<ref name=\"twsBostonGlobe4\">{{cite web \n| author= Sanjay Salomon \n| date= January 30, 2015\n| publisher= Boston Globe\n| url= http://www.boston.com/jobs/news/2015/01/30/can-failure-resume-help-you-succeed/uTBdq9A7LfXXF7vVOlG9oM/story.html\n| title= Can a Failure Resume Help You Succeed?\n| accessdate= January 31, 2016\n| quote=...A 'failure resume' is ... a private exercise ... outline what they learned from the experience ...

Their relationship can bring deeper understanding of the information being collected, however this creates a risk that the interviewer will be unable to be unbiased in their collection and interpretation of information<ref name=\":0\" />.

Interviews have a duration in time, in the sense that the interview has a beginning and an ending.\n\nThe traditional two-person interview format, sometimes called a one-on-one interview, permits direct questions and followups, which enables an interviewer to better gauge the accuracy of responses. It is a flexible arrangement in the sense that subsequent questions can be tailored to clarify earlier answers. Further, it eliminates any possible distortion by having third parties present.\n\nFace to face interviewing makes it easier for people to interact and form a connection, and it helps both the potential employer and potential hire who they might be interacting with.<ref name=SS1> Snap Surveys, [https://www.snapsurveys.com/blog/advantages-disadvantages-facetoface-data-collection/ Advantages and disadvantages of face to face data collection], Retrieved April 27, 2018</ref> Further, face to face interview sessions can be more enjoyable.<ref name=SS1/>\n\n== Contexts ==\nInterviews can happen in a wide variety of contexts:\n\n'''Employment'''. Interviews in an employment context are typically called [[job interview]]s which describe a formal consultation for the purpose of evaluating the qualifications of the interviewee for a specific position.<ref name = \"Dipboye et al\">Dipboye, R. L., Macan, T., & Shahani-Denning, C. (2012). The selection interview from the interviewer and applicant perspectives: Can't have one without the other. In N.

Sometimes the interviews happen in several waves, with the first interview sometimes being called a ''screening interview'' which is a shorter length interview, followed by more in-depth interviews later on, usually by company personnel who can ultimately hire the applicant. Technology has enabled new possibilities for interviewing; for example, video phoning technology has enabled applicants to interview for jobs despite being in different cities or countries than the interviewer. \n\n'''Psychology'''. Psychologists use a variety of interviewing methods and techniques to try to understand and help their patients. In a [[psychiatric interview]], a psychiatrist or psychologist or nurse asks a battery of questions to complete what is called a [[psychiatric assessment]]. Sometimes two people are interviewed by an interviewer, with one format being called [[couple interview]]s.<ref name=\"P-G-2015\">{{cite journal|last1=Polak|first1=L|last2=Green|first2=J|year=2015|title=Using Joint Interviews to Add Analytic Value|url=https://kclpure.kcl.ac.uk/portal/en/publications/using-joint-interviews-to-add-analytic-value(dfe3fe1b-df7e-43f9-b6a1-6ed14f8300f1).html|journal=[[Qualitative Health Research]]|volume=26|issue=12|pages=1638\u201348|doi=10.1177/1049732315580103|pmid=25850721}}</ref> Criminologists and detectives sometimes use [[cognitive interview]]s on eyewitnesses and victims to try to ascertain what can be recalled specifically from a crime scene, hopefully before the specific memories begin to fade in the mind.<ref name = \"Memon,Cronin,Eaves,Bull\">Memon, A., Cronin, O., Eaves, R., Bull, R.

In [[marketing research]] and [[academic research]], interviews are used in a wide variety of ways as a method to do extensive personality tests. [[Interview (research)|Interviews]] are often used in [[qualitative research]] in which firms try to understand how consumers think. Consumer research firms sometimes use [[computer-assisted telephone interviewing]] to randomly dial phone numbers to conduct highly structured telephone interviews, with scripted questions and responses entered directly into the computer.<ref name=\"uslabor\">{{cite web|url=http://www.bls.gov/bls/glossary.htm|title=BLS Information |date=February 28, 2008|work=Glossary|publisher=U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics Division of Information Services |accessdate=2009-05-05}}</ref>\n\n'''Journalism and other media'''. Typically, reporters covering a story in [[journalism]] conduct [[Interview (journalism)|interviews]] over the phone and in person to gain information for subsequent publication.

Such interviews are often recorded.  \n\n'''Other situations'''. Sometimes college representatives or alumni conduct [[college interview]]s with prospective students as a way of assessing a student's suitability while offering the student a chance to learn more about a college.<ref name=\"twsBostonGlobe4\"/> Some services specialize in coaching people for interviews.<ref name=\"twsBostonGlobe4\">{{cite web \n| author= Sanjay Salomon \n| date= January 30, 2015\n| publisher= Boston Globe\n| url= http://www.boston.com/jobs/news/2015/01/30/can-failure-resume-help-you-succeed/uTBdq9A7LfXXF7vVOlG9oM/story.html\n| title= Can a Failure Resume Help You Succeed?\n| accessdate= January 31, 2016\n| quote=...A 'failure resume' is ... a private exercise ... outline what they learned from the experience ...

Ye s absolutely.\" Khatri says people have been posting photographs showing the posters that didn't get as much air-time, posters addressing the range of 'important' causes that news anchors have accused the March of ignoring, like education, inheritance and marital rights. By bringing up the manifesto to defend the posters, for instance, Pakistan Feminists isolated themselves from the supposedly provocative posters, and in fact confirm their 'vulgarity'. It implies that Pakistani feminists agree that feminism should operate within the bounds of 'respectability'. According to her accepting narratives prescribing boundaries of respectability are traps that needs to be avoided by feminists and not to be allowed to be cemented in any social discourse. Feminism with conditions is no feminism. It maintains the division between what is \u2018acceptable\u2019 and what is 'immodest', what is 'public' and 'private', allowed and not. It pits the two against each other, rewarding the feminists who rally for legal rights and work-life balance and slut-shaming those who reclaim gendered slurs and carry the posters they did at the March. She questions whether feminism to allow discriminate and gatekeeping, and this gatekeeping is patriarchy's way of bolstering the binary of purpose vs pleasure, where the feminism of purpose (health, education, marital rights) is 'good' feminism, and the feminism of pleasure (sexual politics, bodily autonomy, agency over time and leisure) is 'bad' feminism, 'immoral' and 'frivolous'. She explains as feminists use the language of real and serious, end up creating a distinction between 'actual' issues and 'pretended' ones and rush to clarify that feminists have included 'important' causes in our demands, end up suggesting that other causes are unimportant.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Khatri |first1=Sadia |title=Should feminists claim Aurat March\u2019s 'vulgar' posters?

Poster slogan has hit them hard. It has upset them. And now, they are angry and trying to speak to us in a language that they think we'll understand. They tell us this is not feminism but fail to explain how. They tell us it's about sex, and as 'respectful' women, how dare we utter of it.<ref name=\"womansxplain\" /> \"When women make demands about their personal lives, their bodies, their sexuality, that's when people feel threatened,\" Dad said. \u201cSo it\u2019s OK to ask the government for the right to education but you can't say you are happily divorced because the breakdown of a matrimony is a shameful thing, a woman\u2019s failure, and you can\u2019t say 'don't send me dick pics' because so-called decent women don't use expressions like dick.\u201d Nobody seems to say anything to the sender, but the reluctant receiver is apparently the problem. Either she likes it (which, to them, makes her a 'slut') or she doesn't (which offends them). So as usual, women cannot win Ms. Mohydin says. Remaining on the same issue Ms. Mohydin strongly questions \"Are they unsettled at the loss of this opportunity to titillate women with their phallus? Why are they all shriveling up? Have protesting women given them performance anxiety or what.<ref name=\"womansxplain\" />\n\nContinuing her strong denunciation Ms. Mohydin says, \"The placards were a mirror and instead of taking this moment as an opportunity to introspect, they have decided to beat their chest instead. Not their slain bodies, not their acid-burnt faces, not their immobility, not their lack of representation, not the dearth of affordable housing, not the moral policing their choices and bodies are subjected to, not the denial of female education, not the constant threat of sexual harassment and onslaught, not the social structures that cut women\u2019s potential in half, not the exploitation, not the objectification, not the fact that for many, women are still not human.

Ye s absolutely.\" Khatri says people have been posting photographs showing the posters that didn't get as much air-time, posters addressing the range of 'important' causes that news anchors have accused the March of ignoring, like education, inheritance and marital rights. By bringing up the manifesto to defend the posters, for instance, Pakistan Feminists isolated themselves from the supposedly provocative posters, and in fact confirm their 'vulgarity'. It implies that Pakistani feminists agree that feminism should operate within the bounds of 'respectability'. According to her accepting narratives prescribing boundaries of respectability are traps that needs to be avoided by feminists and not to be allowed to be cemented in any social discourse. Feminism with conditions is no feminism. It maintains the division between what is \u2018acceptable\u2019 and what is 'immodest', what is 'public' and 'private', allowed and not. It pits the two against each other, rewarding the feminists who rally for legal rights and work-life balance and slut-shaming those who reclaim gendered slurs and carry the posters they did at the March. She questions whether feminism to allow discriminate and gatekeeping, and this gatekeeping is patriarchy's way of bolstering the binary of purpose vs pleasure, where the feminism of purpose (health, education, marital rights) is 'good' feminism, and the feminism of pleasure (sexual politics, bodily autonomy, agency over time and leisure) is 'bad' feminism, 'immoral' and 'frivolous'. She explains as feminists use the language of real and serious, end up creating a distinction between 'actual' issues and 'pretended' ones and rush to clarify that feminists have included 'important' causes in our demands, end up suggesting that other causes are unimportant.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Khatri |first1=Sadia |title=Should feminists claim Aurat March\u2019s 'vulgar' posters?

Poster slogan has hit them hard. It has upset them. And now, they are angry and trying to speak to us in a language that they think we'll understand.

Among other prominent members of the family are ''Ismail Khan The Great'' and his son ''Ali Khan'', ''Muhammad Pasha'' son of Ali Khan, ''Cewer (Ja'afar) Agha'' brother of Simko.

According to Iranian historian [[Ahmad Kasravi]], Nizam ul-Saltana officially invited ''Cewer Agha'' to [[Tabriz]] in order to consult him on the border issues between Iran and the [[Ottoman Empire]]. Once Cewer Agha arrived in Tabriz, Nizam ul-Saltana ordered ''Muhammad Hussein Khan Zargham'' to invite Cewer Agha to his own residence and murder him. Cewer Agha was accompanied by seven of his guards including one of his uncles. Muhammad Ali Mirza, the Iranian [[Crown Prince]], ordered his murder via [[telegraph]] sent to Nizam ul-Saltana. Five of Cewer Agha's guards managed to escape from the murder plot in [[Tabriz]] in a ferocious battle and return to Chari castle. Cewer's father, Muhammad Agha, sought help from [[Abdul Hamid II|Sultan Abdulhamid II]] in [[Istanbul]] to avenge the murder of his son. However Iranian envoy in Ottoman court managed to counter his efforts and according to some sources, Muhammad Agha was assassinated in a Qajar conspiracy in Istanbul. Murder of Cewer Agha caused outrage among the Kurds. Moreover, many Iranian intellectuals and constitutionalists in [[Tabriz]] and [[Tehran]] condemned his assassination.\n\n==Political life==\nThere are different and conflicting views about Simko among Kurdish historians.<ref>According to Mehrdad R.

Moreover, many Iranian intellectuals and constitutionalists in [[Tabriz]] and [[Tehran]] condemned his assassination.\n\n==Political life==\nThere are different and conflicting views about Simko among Kurdish historians.<ref>According to Mehrdad R. Izady (Kurdish-Belgian  writer), <blockquote>The Shakak chief Ismail Agha Simko, before his execution by the Iranian monarch Reza Shah in 1930, carried out enough atrocities in his 15 year political life to place him alongside such historical villains as Attila the Hun.....He then proceeded to drink the patriarch's blood as a demonstration of his rage</blockquote>''The Kurds: A Concise Handbook'', Mehrdad R. Izady, Taylor & Francis, 1992, {{ISBN|0-8448-1727-9}}, {{ISBN|978-0-8448-1727-9}}, p. 57</ref> After the murder of Cewer Agha, Simko became the head of Shikak forces. At this time, Iranian government was trying to assassinate him like the other members of his family. In 1919, Mukarram ul-Molk, the governor of Azerbaijan devised a plot to kill Simko by sending him a present with a bomb hidden in it.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.kurdmania.com/simko_agha_aufstieg.html |accessdate=2009-02-23 |language=German |work=Kurdmania |first=Dilan |last=Handren |title=The Rebellion of Simko Agha |date=2009-02-02 }}</ref>  Although the plot failed, but it revealed the intentions of the Iranian government, and propelled Simko into a turbulent period of political and military confrontation with Iran.\n\nSimko was in contact with other Kurdish nationalists such as Abdurrazaq Badrkhan (Bedirxan) and Seyyed Taha Gilani (grandson of Sheikh Ubaidullah Nahri who had revolted against Iran in 1880s). Seyyed Taha was a Kurdish nationalist who was conducting propaganda among the Iranian Kurds for the union of [[Iran|Iranian Kurdistan]] and [[Turkey|Turkish Kurdistan]] in an independent state.<ref>F.

He represents {{ill|Markane Idrettslag|no|lt=Markane IL}} and is the younger brother of biathlete [[Tarjei B\u00f8]]. Thingnes B\u00f8 has won the [[Biathlon World Cup]] in 2018/19 and 2019/20. He is the third most successful male biathlete of all time in the World Cup with 48 individual World Cup victories including victories at the [[Winter Olympic Games]].<ref>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biathlon_World_Cup#Race_winners</ref>\n\nThingnes B\u00f8 is famous for his fast skiing, which was his biggest strength in the early part of his career. However, in recent years Thingnes B\u00f8 has improved his shooting accuracy and elevated his ski speed to new heights. This development has made him the dominant biathlete in the men's World Cup for the last two seasons.\n\n==Early life==\nThingnes B\u00f8 is the son of Klemet B\u00f8 and Aslaug Hildegunn Thingnes B\u00f8. He was born and raised in [[Stryn]], and is the second-youngest of five siblings.\n\n==Career==\n===2009===\nAt Hovedlandsrennet in [[Beitost\u00f8len]] he won the silver medal in relay with Jarle Midtfjell G\u00f8rven, Runar Netland, and Johan Eirik Meland.\nIn September he won two gold medals in the Norwegian championships in roller-ski biathlon held in [[Vik]], [[Sogn]] in the 17-year-old men's class. First he won the sprint, then the pursuit.\n\n===2010\u20132012===\nThingnes B\u00f8 won several international medals in 2010 and 2011. In 2012 he became a junior world champion for the third time. In April 2012 he was drafted for the Norwegian senior National Team.<ref>https://www.vg.no/sport/skiskyting/i/e98V9/tarjei-boe-faar-med-lillebror-johannes-paa-landslaget</ref> 18 years old at the time, he is one of the youngest Norwegians ever to be drafted for the national biathlon team.<ref>https://www.dagbladet.no/sport/trodde-det-var-helt-urealistisk-at-jeg-ble-satset-pa-na/63317191</ref> In the [[2012\u201313 Biathlon World Cup|2012/13 season]] he had his [[Biathlon World Cup|world cup]] debut, competing alongside his older brother [[Tarjei B\u00f8]], [[Emil Hegle Svendsen]], [[Ole Einar Bj\u00f8rndalen]], [[Rune Brattsveen]], and others.\n\n===2013===\nIn January/February 2013 during the Junior World Championship in [[Obertilliach]], [[Austria]], Thingnes B\u00f8 won the silver medal in sprint, gold in the 12.5&nbsp;km pursuit, and gold in the 7.5&nbsp;km relay.\n\n===2013/14 season: Breakthrough on the World Cup===\nHis big breakthrough came during the [[2013\u201314 Biathlon World Cup|2013\u201314 season]] where he won his first World Cup race and was third in the overall standings. Thingnes B\u00f8 won four more World Cup races for a total of five.\n\nThingnes B\u00f8 got his first World Cup win on 14 December 2013 in the sprint and his second the day after with a win in the pursuit. He won three more World Cup races in [[Kontiolahti]], two sprints and one pursuit.\n\n===2014 to 2017: First world championship titles===\nIn the [[2014\u201315 Biathlon World Cup|2014/15 season]] Johannes became a [[Biathlon World Championships|world champion]] for the first time as he won the [[Biathlon World Championships 2015 \u2013 Men's sprint|sprint race]] in Kontiolahti. Johannes failed to defend his lead from the sprint race in the following pursuit race and ended the [[Biathlon World Championships 2015 \u2013 Men's pursuit|pursuit]] in 31st position after eight missed shots. Johannes won two other races this season and continued his consistency from the previous season to finish fifth in the overall World Cup.\n\nComing into the [[2015\u201316 Biathlon World Cup|2015/16 season]], Thingnes B\u00f8 was again considered a potential challenger to the stranglehold rival [[Martin Fourcade]] held on the World Cup. However, a disappointing start to the season ruined Thingnes B\u00f8's aspirations in the overall World Cup, and he subsequently changed his focus to the 2016 Biathlon World Championships at home grounds in [[Biathlon World Championships 2016|Holmenkollen, Oslo]]. The first success came when Thingnes B\u00f8 won the World Cup sprint race in [[2015\u201316 Biathlon World Cup \u2013 World Cup 4|Ruhpolding]] ahead of fellow countrymen [[Emil Hegle Svendsen]] and his older brother, [[Tarjei B\u00f8]]. In the World Championships in March 2016, Thingnes B\u00f8 won the Mass Start race when he outsprinted Martin Fourcade and [[Ole Einar Bj\u00f8rndalen]] on the final lap.<ref>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biathlon_World_Championships_2016_%E2%80%93_Men%27s_mass_start</ref>\n\nThingnes B\u00f8 only won two world cup races in the [[2016\u201317 Biathlon World Cup|2016/17 season]]. After another difficult start to the season, Thingnes B\u00f8 had nine consecutive top-ten results in individual races from January to March. In this period, Thingnes B\u00f8 won three individual silver medals at the [[Biathlon World Championships 2016|World Championships in Hochfilzen]].\n\n===2017/18 season: Battle with Fourcade and Olympic title===\nA large part of Thingnes B\u00f8's career will be defined by his rivalry with French biathlon legend [[Martin Fourcade]], and in the [[2017\u201318 Biathlon World Cup|2017/18 season]] this rivalry reached new heights. Of the first 14 World Cup races, Thingnes B\u00f8 won eight and looked to be a serious challenger to Fourcade in the Overall [[Biathlon World Cup|World Cup]].<ref>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017%E2%80%9318_Biathlon_World_Cup</ref> Thingnes B\u00f8 even wore the yellow bib as the leader of the Overall World Cup after he won the opening [[2017\u201318 Biathlon World Cup \u2013 Individual Men|20km Individual]] in [[\u00d6stersund]], becoming the first Norwegian to wear the yellow bib for two years and breaking Fourcade's stranglehold on the jersey, before losing it to the Frenchman again in the [[2017\u201318 Biathlon World Cup \u2013 Sprint Men|next race]].\n\nAfter the World Cup events in [[Rasen-Antholz|Antholz-Anterselva]] in late January, Thingnes B\u00f8 was a close second to Fourcade in the overall World Cup.<ref>https://biathlonresults.com/</ref> Having dominated the preceding World Cup events, expectations were high for Thingnes B\u00f8 in the upcoming [[2018 Winter Olympics|Winter Olympics]] in [[Pyeongchang County|Pyeongchang]], [[South Korea]]. However, Thingnes B\u00f8 had a disappointing start to the games with a season-worst 31st place finish in the [[Biathlon at the 2018 Winter Olympics \u2013 Men's sprint|sprint race]]. The following [[Biathlon at the 2018 Winter Olympics \u2013 Men's pursuit|pursuit race]] ended little better for Thingnes B\u00f8, who finished 21st with six missed shots. In the [[Biathlon at the 2018 Winter Olympics \u2013 Men's individual|individual 20km race]], which is usually considered his weakest race discipline, Thingnes B\u00f8 finally managed to find his best level. Despite two misses, he won the competition with a small time gap to Slovenian [[Jakov Fak]] and Austrian [[Dominik Landertinger]] in third place. Rival Fourcade finished fifth with equal shooting, but trailed Thingnes B\u00f8 by a substantial amount of time.<ref>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biathlon_at_the_2018_Winter_Olympics_%E2%80%93_Men%27s_individual</ref> Thingnes B\u00f8 finished the Winter Olympics with a disappointing 16th place finish in the [[Biathlon at the 2018 Winter Olympics \u2013 Men's mass start|mass start race]], but managed to take two additional silver medals in the [[Biathlon at the 2018 Winter Olympics \u2013 Mixed relay|mixed relay]] and [[Biathlon at the 2018 Winter Olympics \u2013 Men's relay|men's relay]].\n\nFor the remainder of the season, Thingnes B\u00f8 continued to produce consistent results, despite not recording another win. He finished the [[2017\u201318 Biathlon World Cup|World Cup season]] as runner-up to overall winner Martin Fourcade.\n\n===2018/19 season: Setting new records for World Cup dominance===\n====The new king of biathlon====\nHaving come very close to beating Fourcade in the [[2017\u201318 Biathlon World Cup|previous World Cup season]], Thingnes B\u00f8 was widely considered the prime contender to Fourcade for the overall World Cup in [[2018\u201319 Biathlon World Cup|2018/19]].<ref>https://www.ispo.com/en/people/sponsors-and-successes-biathlon-stars-winter-2018/19</ref> But an injury-marred autumn with a back injury left severe question marks about Thingnes B\u00f8s shape for the beginning of the new season.<ref>https://www.langrenn.com/nye-problemer-for-johannes-thingnes-bo.6160623-1743.html</ref> These questions were made to shame, when Thingnes B\u00f8 found himself as the winner of the opening sprint race in [[Sjusj\u00f8en]] (not a part of the IBU World Cup calendar).<ref>https://www.langrenn.com/thingnes-bo-tok-apningsseieren-pa-sjusjoen.6168742-348438.html</ref> In the [[2018\u201319 Biathlon World Cup|initial World Cup events]] Thingnes B\u00f8 confirmed his great shape by winning six of eight individual races before [[Christmas]]. Having scored 428 points in eight races, Thingnes B\u00f8 lead the world cup by 116 points over Russian and former doping offender [[Alexander Loginov (biathlon)|Alexander Loginov]].<ref>https://ibu.blob.core.windows.net/docs/1819/BT/SWRL/CP03/SMMS/BT_C78B_1.0.pdf</ref> Meanwhile, the expected rival Martin Fourcade was in fifth place and trailing Thingnes B\u00f8 with 165 points. Thingnes B\u00f8 was now the hot favourite for winning the overall World Cup despite having only raced 8 out of a season-total of 26 individual races.\n\n====Podium streak in January====\nAfter Christmas break, Thingnes B\u00f8 continued to dominate the World Cup events. From and including the first world cup events in [[Oberhof, Germany|Oberhof]] until the world cup events in [[Soldier Hollow]], Thingnes B\u00f8 did not once leave the podium in an individual race.<ref>https://ibu.blob.core.windows.net/docs/1819/BT/SWRL/CP08/SMPU/BT_C78B_1.1.pdf</ref> At this point, Thingnes B\u00f8 had won 12 out 16 individual races (with one sprint race in Canmore being cancelled), while there were still 9 more individual races to go. However, Thingnes B\u00f8 did not manage to extend his streak of podium finishes in Soldier Hollow, where a sub-par standing shooting with four missed shots cost him the victory in [[2018\u201319 Biathlon World Cup \u2013 Stage 8|the initial sprint race]]. The following pursuit race saw Thingnes B\u00f8 deliver another mediocre performance on the shooting range as he finished fourth. Thingnes B\u00f8 later showed great sportsmanship and admitted that he had not fired all of his five shots at the last standing shooting. As a penalty for his offence, he agreed with the IBU to receive 0 instead of the 43 world cup points that his fourth-place finish would otherwise have netted him.<ref>https://www.biathlonworld.com/news/detail/ibu-boe-soho-pursuit</ref> The poor standing shooting in Soldier Hollow quickly fuelled considerations among experts and fans about whether Thingnes B\u00f8 would run into the same shooting problems in the upcoming [[Biathlon World Championships 2019|World Championships in \u00d6stersund]], where wind conditions are generally very difficult.<ref>https://www.vg.no/sport/skiskyting/i/4dpyOV/ekspert-om-thingnes-boe-litt-krise</ref>\n\n====World Championships in \u00d6stersund====\nThingnes B\u00f8 started the 2019 World Championships in strong fashion as he outskied everyone to take home the title as World Champion in the [[Biathlon World Championships 2019 \u2013 Men's sprint|sprint race]] - despite one missed shot (everyone else in the top eight shot clean), Thingnes B\u00f8 comfortably won the sprint race ahead of new rival Alexander Loginov, who was, at the time, still in second position in the overall world cup. The next race was the pursuit race, where Thingnes B\u00f8 was, by virtue of a large time advantage from the sprint race, the overwhelming favourite to take a second consecutive gold medal. Thingnes B\u00f8 lived up to his favourite status in the initial part of the race and lead the race with almost one minute coming into the last standing shooting. However, another breakdown on the shooting range meant that Ukrainian underdog [[Dmytro Pidruchnyi]] left the shooting range in first place with Thingnes B\u00f8 following in second place 15 seconds behind. Thingnes B\u00f8, surprisingly, did not catch Pidruchnyi on the final loop and had to settle for a silver medal after a dramatic last loop chase.<ref>https://ibu.blob.core.windows.net/docs/1819/BT/SWRL/CH__/SMPU/BT_C77D_1.0.pdf</ref> Thingnes B\u00f8 then delivered two disappointing performances in the Individual 20k (9th place) and the mass start (13th place). In the team events, however, Thingnes B\u00f8 won three additional gold medals.\n\n====New record-holder====\nHaving now won 13 races throughout the season and effectively securing himself the crystal globe as winner of the Overall World Cup, Thingnes B\u00f8 had only three more races left on home soil, in [[Holmenkollen]], before the season ended. The last world cup event in Holmenkollen turned out great for Thingnes B\u00f8, who took the victory in all three races.<ref>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018%E2%80%9319_Biathlon_World_Cup</ref> With 16 individual victories, he thus became the record holder of the most individual world cup races won in a single season as he smashed the previous record of 14 victories set by Martin Fourcade two years earlier in the 2016/17 season.<ref>https://www.aftenposten.no/sport/skiskyting/i/na4LBJ/boe-avsluttet-sesongen-med-perfekt-loep-det-gaar-ikke-an-aa-faa-en-flottere-avslutning</ref>\n\n===2019/20 season: Parental leave and another world cup title===\n====Pre-season speculations====\nArguably the main talking point coming into the [[2019\u201320 Biathlon World Cup|new season (2019/20)]] was whether Thingnes B\u00f8 could retain his dominance from the previous season.<ref>https://www.olympicchannel.com/en/stories/news/detail/biathlon-schedule-races-2020-preview/</ref> Most bookmakers, experts and fans predicted another Thingnes B\u00f8-victory in the world cup, although his favourite status had diminished with the knowledge that Thingnes B\u00f8 would have to leave for multiple world cup events in January because he had to go on parental leave.<ref>https://sport.tv2.dk/skisport/2019-11-30-punkterer-en-baby-alle-tiders-tvekamp</ref> Thingnes B\u00f8 dismissed the idea that he would even fight for the overall world cup title because of his January-absence, and he instead insisted that his goals were instead the [[Biathlon World Championships 2020|World Championships]]<ref>https://skisport.no/nyheter/thingnes-bo-tror-ikke-pa-drommereprise-mister-trolig-verdenscuprenn/</ref>, which were held in one of Biathlon's most iconic places, [[Rasen-Antholz|Antholz-Anterselva]].\n\n====Season-opening====\nThe non-official season-opening in [[Sjusj\u00f8en]] was not a success for Thingnes B\u00f8, who felt heavy on the tracks and only managed fourth in the sprint race, beaten by rival Fourcade who finished third with similar shooting.<ref>https://www.aftenposten.no/sport/skiskyting/i/opx0P7/thingnes-boe-gikk-seg-svimmel-det-var-grusomt</ref> In the first world cup competitions in [[\u00d6stersund]], Thingnes B\u00f8 turned things around in his own favour, and he convincingly took the yellow bib with an emphatic victory in the sprint race ahead of his elder brother, Tarjei. Just as Thingnes B\u00f8 looked like he was back to his best, disaster struck in the Individual 20k, where relatively poor Norwegian skis ruined Thingnes B\u00f8s competition. The French waxing team had found the perfect formula for the tricky snow conditions, and as a result, Thingnes B\u00f8 was passed by Fourcade who went on to take the yellow jersey from Thingnes B\u00f8 in an all-french-podium.<ref>https://www.nrk.no/sport/thingnes-bo-knust-av-fourcade-i-sporet_-_-darlegaste-pa-mange-ar-1.14808880</ref>\n\n====Dominance before Christmas====\nCasting aside the equipment failure in \u00d6stersund, Thingnes B\u00f8 found himself back on the top in the next World Cup stage in [[Hochfilzen]], where he won [[2019\u201320 Biathlon World Cup \u2013 Stage 2|both individual competitions]]. In the following world cup stage, Thingnes B\u00f8 once again spoiled the French party in [[Le Grand-Bornand]], [[Annecy]]. The outstanding ski speed of the previous season was starting to manifest itself again with Thingnes B\u00f8 taking an impressive fourth place finish in the sprint race despite shooting two misses. The pursuit race saw Thingnes B\u00f8 take another world cup victory, and the following mass start, where Thingnes B\u00f8 won by over 40 seconds to Emilien Jacquelin, cemented his status as the best biathlete in the world.<ref>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019%E2%80%9320_Biathlon_World_Cup_%E2%80%93_Stage_3</ref> Going into the Christmas break, Thingnes B\u00f8 had won five of seven individual competitions and secured an advantage of 61 points to his brother Tarjei who was second in the overall world cup.<ref>https://ibu.blob.core.windows.net/docs/1920/BT/SWRL/CP03/SMMS/BT_C78B_1.0.pdf</ref> \n\n====Return of the king====\nThingnes B\u00f8 did not compete in the two World Cup stages held in Oberhof and Ruhpolding, and first returned to the World Cup in [[Pokljuka]] in late January, where he showed his class by taking a victory and a second place in the two individual events. While not as dominant as before Christmas, Thingnes B\u00f8s return signalled that he was on the right tracks for the [[Biathlon World Championships 2020|World Championships]]. Thingnes B\u00f8's return also ruined Fourcade's run of victories in early January - a run that had netted Fourcade the yellow bib as leader of the world cup. After Pokljuka, Thingnes B\u00f8 was trailing Fourcade by 119 points in the World Cup, and another crystal globe looked like a difficult achievement for Thingnes B\u00f8.\n\n====World championships====\nThingnes B\u00f8 was the most successful male athlete at the World Championships with six medals in total, including three medals in individual competitions.<ref>https://sport.tv2.dk/skisport/2020-02-23-johannes-boe-knuser-rivalerne-og-saetter-vm-rekord</ref> The success did not come immediately for Thingnes B\u00f8, however. Still not in top shape after his absence in January, Thingnes B\u00f8 delivered a sub-par [[Biathlon World Championships 2020 \u2013 Men's sprint|sprint race]] to only finish fifth. The [[Biathlon World Championships 2020 \u2013 Men's pursuit|pursuit race]] indicated an increase in form, as Thingnes B\u00f8 managed to take the silver medal. Despite his status as the best skier in biathlon, Thingnes B\u00f8 lost the fight with Frenchman Emilien Jacquelin on the last loop, where a tactical blunder in the finale left Thingnes B\u00f8 vulnerable to Jacquelin's explosive sprint.<ref>https://www.biathlon-antholz.it/en/newsroom/16-02-2020-jacquelin-outdoes-the-superstar/17-192.html</ref> Thingnes B\u00f8 took another silver medal in the [[Biathlon World Championships 2020 \u2013 Men's individual|Individual 20k]], where he was beaten by rival Fourcade. A missed shot at the last standing shooting likely cost Thingnes B\u00f8 the gold medal, since a clean shooting would have sent him out on the last loop ahead of Fourcade.<ref>https://www.aftenposten.no/sport/skiskyting/i/opQVmK/erkerivalen-til-topps-da-vm-gullet-glapp-for-boe-irriterende-aa-se-paa</ref> With no individual gold medals to his name, pressure was high on Thingnes B\u00f8 in the last individual race of the championships, the men's [[Biathlon World Championships 2020 \u2013 Men's mass start|mass start]]. Thingnes B\u00f8 duly delivered, and secured the gold medal with clean 20/20 shooting and fast skiing. Having also won medals in all team events, he entered, Thingnes B\u00f8 managed to win six out of seven possible medals in the championships.\n\n====Nove Mesto and wax gate====\nIn early March, Thingnes B\u00f8 was in even better ski shape in the next World Cup events in [[Nov\u00e9 M\u011bsto na Morav\u011b]], [[Czech Republic]] (held with no spectators at the venue as a security measure against the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic|Covid-19 pandemic]]<ref>https://focusbiathlon.com/news/item/328-coronavirus-the-event-in-nove-mesto-will-be-without-spectators.html</ref>). Thingnes B\u00f8 skied incredibly fast and shot clean in the opening sprint race, which automatically catapulted him to another World Cup victory. The following mass start race saw Thingnes B\u00f8 deliver another masterclass performance, winning the race with three missed shots, and out-skiing French nemesis Emilien Jacquelin on the final loop. The race, much like the Individual 20k in \u00d6stersund the same season, was unusual, as the Norwegian and German waxing teams were unusually successful in their ski-waxing strategy.<ref>https://www.biathlonworld.com/news/detail/nove-mesto-hat-trick-johannes-thingnes-boe-powers-to-mass-start-win</ref> However, poor shooting from Thingnes B\u00f8 throughout the race meant that Thingnes B\u00f8 had to catch up after each shooting, and so he eventually managed to catch and pass Emilien Jacquelin on the final loop.\n\n====Corona-cancellations and securing the world cup====\nThe competitions in [[Kontiolahti]], the penultimate World Cup stage on the calendar, were also held with no spectators because of the fear for Covid-19 spread, and the mixed events were eventually cancelled.<ref>https://www.biathlonworld.com/news/detail/ibu-statement-on-world-cup-in-oslo</ref> For similar reasons, the competitions in [[Holmenkollen]] were also cancelled leaving only two races in Kontiolahti left in the season. Before these races, Thingnes B\u00f8 had already managed to overtake Fourcade in the overall World Cup, courtesy of the points system that subtracts the two worst scores of the season (Thingnes B\u00f8 could subtract 0 points because he did not start in two (four) competitions in January).<ref>http://www.realbiathlon.com/2013/03/world-cup-scoring-system-when-have-you.html</ref> However, Thingnes B\u00f8 only lead the World Cup with a slim advantage and he had to deliver two top results to keep the lead. Thingnes B\u00f8 did as expected and won the sprint race with Fourcade in second place. It was then made public that Fourcade planned to retire after the following pursuit race, and suddenly the pursuit race was looking to set the stage for a last battle between the two rivals.<ref>https://www.olympicchannel.com/en/stories/news/detail/martin-fourcade-announces-surprise-retirement-from-biathlon/</ref> Thingnes B\u00f8 secured his second overall world cup title with a fourth place in the pursuit, while Fourcade won the race and missed out on the overall world cup by three points.<ref>https://www.olympicchannel.com/en/stories/news/detail/martin-fourcade-wins-biathlon-race-as-thingnes-boe-takes-overall-world-cu/</ref>\n\n==Biathlon results==\nAll results are sourced from the [[International Biathlon Union]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://biathlonresults.com/|title=DATACENTER|website=biathlonresults.com|access-date=16 March 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.biathlonworld.com/athletes/johannes-thingnes-boe/id/btnor11605199301/|title=Johannes Thingnes Boe|website=International Biathlon Union \u2013 IBU|access-date=16 March 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Olympic Games===\n''3 medals (1 gold, 2 silver)''\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|- \"\n!style=\"width:200px;\"|Event\n!style=\"width:70px;\"|Individual\n!style=\"width:70px;\"|Sprint\n!style=\"width:70px;\"|Pursuit\n!style=\"width:70px;\"|{{nowrap|Mass start}}\n!style=\"width:70px;\"|Relay\n!style=\"width:70px;\"|{{nowrap|Mixed relay}}\n|-\n| align=left |{{flagicon|Russia}} [[Biathlon at the 2014 Winter Olympics|2014 Sochi]]\n| 11th\n| 54th\n| 32nd\n| 8th\n| 4th\n| \u2014\n|-\n| align=left |{{flagicon|South Korea}} [[Biathlon at the 2018 Winter Olympics|2018 Pyeongchang]]\n| style=\"background:gold;\"| '''Gold'''\n| 31st\n| 21st\n| 16th\n| style=\"background:silver;\"| '''Silver'''\n| style=\"background:silver;\"| '''Silver'''\n|}\n:''*The mixed relay was added as an event in 2014.''\n\n===World Championships===\n''20 medals (10 gold, 8 silver, 2 bronze)''\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|- \"\n!style=\"width:200px;\"|Event\n!style=\"width:70px;\"|Individual\n!style=\"width:70px;\"|Sprint\n!style=\"width:70px;\"|Pursuit\n!style=\"width:70px;\"|{{nowrap|Mass start}}\n!style=\"width:70px;\"|Relay\n!style=\"width:70px;\"|{{nowrap|Mixed relay}}\n!style=\"width:70px;\"|{{nowrap|Single mixed relay}}\n|-\n| align=left |{{flagicon|FIN}} [[Biathlon World Championships 2015|2015 Kontiolahti]]\n| 7th\n| style=\"background:gold;\"| '''Gold'''\n| 31st\n| 6th\n| style=\"background:silver;\"| '''Silver'''\n| style=\"background:#cfaa88;\"| '''Bronze'''\n| rowspan=\"3\" {{n/a}}\n|-\n| align=left |{{flagicon|NOR}} [[Biathlon World Championships 2016|2016 Oslo Holmenkollen]]\n|4th\n|4th\n|4th\n|style=\"background:gold;\"| '''Gold'''\n|style=\"background:gold;\"| '''Gold'''\n| style=\"background:#cfaa88;\"| '''Bronze'''\n|-\n| align=left |{{flagicon|AUT}} [[Biathlon World Championships 2017|2017 Hochfilzen]]\n| 8th\n| align=center bgcolor=silver| '''Silver'''\n| align=center bgcolor=silver| '''Silver'''\n| align=center bgcolor=silver| '''Silver'''\n| 8th\n| 8th\n|-\n| align=left |{{flagicon|SWE}} [[Biathlon World Championships 2019|2019 \u00d6stersund]]\n| 9th\n| style=\"background:gold;\"| '''Gold'''\n| style=\"background:silver;\"| '''Silver'''\n| 13th\n| style=\"background:gold;\"| '''Gold'''\n| style=\"background:gold;\"| '''Gold'''\n| style=\"background:gold;\"| '''Gold'''\n|-\n| align=left |{{flagicon|ITA}} [[Biathlon World Championships 2020|2020 Antholz-Anterselva]]\n| style=\"background:silver;\"| '''Silver'''\n| 5th\n| style=\"background:silver;\"| '''Silver'''\n| style=\"background:gold;\"| '''Gold'''\n| style=\"background:silver;\"| '''Silver'''\n| style=\"background:gold;\"| '''Gold'''\n| style=\"background:gold;\"| '''Gold'''\n|}\n\n\n:''*During Olympic seasons competitions are only held for those events not included in the Olympic program.''\n:''**The single mixed relay was added as an event in 2019.''\n\n===World Cup===\n====Season standings====\n{| class=wikitable style=\"text-align:center\"\n!Season !!

He represents {{ill|Markane Idrettslag|no|lt=Markane IL}} and is the younger brother of biathlete [[Tarjei B\u00f8]]. Thingnes B\u00f8 has won the [[Biathlon World Cup]] in 2018/19 and 2019/20. He is the third most successful male biathlete of all time in the World Cup with 48 individual World Cup victories including victories at the [[Winter Olympic Games]].<ref>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biathlon_World_Cup#Race_winners</ref>\n\nThingnes B\u00f8 is famous for his fast skiing, which was his biggest strength in the early part of his career. However, in recent years Thingnes B\u00f8 has improved his shooting accuracy and elevated his ski speed to new heights. This development has made him the dominant biathlete in the men's World Cup for the last two seasons.\n\n==Early life==\nThingnes B\u00f8 is the son of Klemet B\u00f8 and Aslaug Hildegunn Thingnes B\u00f8. He was born and raised in [[Stryn]], and is the second-youngest of five siblings.\n\n==Career==\n===2009===\nAt Hovedlandsrennet in [[Beitost\u00f8len]] he won the silver medal in relay with Jarle Midtfjell G\u00f8rven, Runar Netland, and Johan Eirik Meland.\nIn September he won two gold medals in the Norwegian championships in roller-ski biathlon held in [[Vik]], [[Sogn]] in the 17-year-old men's class. First he won the sprint, then the pursuit.\n\n===2010\u20132012===\nThingnes B\u00f8 won several international medals in 2010 and 2011. In 2012 he became a junior world champion for the third time. In April 2012 he was drafted for the Norwegian senior National Team.<ref>https://www.vg.no/sport/skiskyting/i/e98V9/tarjei-boe-faar-med-lillebror-johannes-paa-landslaget</ref> 18 years old at the time, he is one of the youngest Norwegians ever to be drafted for the national biathlon team.<ref>https://www.dagbladet.no/sport/trodde-det-var-helt-urealistisk-at-jeg-ble-satset-pa-na/63317191</ref> In the [[2012\u201313 Biathlon World Cup|2012/13 season]] he had his [[Biathlon World Cup|world cup]] debut, competing alongside his older brother [[Tarjei B\u00f8]], [[Emil Hegle Svendsen]], [[Ole Einar Bj\u00f8rndalen]], [[Rune Brattsveen]], and others.\n\n===2013===\nIn January/February 2013 during the Junior World Championship in [[Obertilliach]], [[Austria]], Thingnes B\u00f8 won the silver medal in sprint, gold in the 12.5&nbsp;km pursuit, and gold in the 7.5&nbsp;km relay.\n\n===2013/14 season: Breakthrough on the World Cup===\nHis big breakthrough came during the [[2013\u201314 Biathlon World Cup|2013\u201314 season]] where he won his first World Cup race and was third in the overall standings. Thingnes B\u00f8 won four more World Cup races for a total of five.\n\nThingnes B\u00f8 got his first World Cup win on 14 December 2013 in the sprint and his second the day after with a win in the pursuit. He won three more World Cup races in [[Kontiolahti]], two sprints and one pursuit.\n\n===2014 to 2017: First world championship titles===\nIn the [[2014\u201315 Biathlon World Cup|2014/15 season]] Johannes became a [[Biathlon World Championships|world champion]] for the first time as he won the [[Biathlon World Championships 2015 \u2013 Men's sprint|sprint race]] in Kontiolahti. Johannes failed to defend his lead from the sprint race in the following pursuit race and ended the [[Biathlon World Championships 2015 \u2013 Men's pursuit|pursuit]] in 31st position after eight missed shots. Johannes won two other races this season and continued his consistency from the previous season to finish fifth in the overall World Cup.\n\nComing into the [[2015\u201316 Biathlon World Cup|2015/16 season]], Thingnes B\u00f8 was again considered a potential challenger to the stranglehold rival [[Martin Fourcade]] held on the World Cup. However, a disappointing start to the season ruined Thingnes B\u00f8's aspirations in the overall World Cup, and he subsequently changed his focus to the 2016 Biathlon World Championships at home grounds in [[Biathlon World Championships 2016|Holmenkollen, Oslo]]. The first success came when Thingnes B\u00f8 won the World Cup sprint race in [[2015\u201316 Biathlon World Cup \u2013 World Cup 4|Ruhpolding]] ahead of fellow countrymen [[Emil Hegle Svendsen]] and his older brother, [[Tarjei B\u00f8]]. In the World Championships in March 2016, Thingnes B\u00f8 won the Mass Start race when he outsprinted Martin Fourcade and [[Ole Einar Bj\u00f8rndalen]] on the final lap.<ref>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biathlon_World_Championships_2016_%E2%80%93_Men%27s_mass_start</ref>\n\nThingnes B\u00f8 only won two world cup races in the [[2016\u201317 Biathlon World Cup|2016/17 season]]. After another difficult start to the season, Thingnes B\u00f8 had nine consecutive top-ten results in individual races from January to March. In this period, Thingnes B\u00f8 won three individual silver medals at the [[Biathlon World Championships 2016|World Championships in Hochfilzen]].\n\n===2017/18 season: Battle with Fourcade and Olympic title===\nA large part of Thingnes B\u00f8's career will be defined by his rivalry with French biathlon legend [[Martin Fourcade]], and in the [[2017\u201318 Biathlon World Cup|2017/18 season]] this rivalry reached new heights. Of the first 14 World Cup races, Thingnes B\u00f8 won eight and looked to be a serious challenger to Fourcade in the Overall [[Biathlon World Cup|World Cup]].<ref>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017%E2%80%9318_Biathlon_World_Cup</ref> Thingnes B\u00f8 even wore the yellow bib as the leader of the Overall World Cup after he won the opening [[2017\u201318 Biathlon World Cup \u2013 Individual Men|20km Individual]] in [[\u00d6stersund]], becoming the first Norwegian to wear the yellow bib for two years and breaking Fourcade's stranglehold on the jersey, before losing it to the Frenchman again in the [[2017\u201318 Biathlon World Cup \u2013 Sprint Men|next race]].\n\nAfter the World Cup events in [[Rasen-Antholz|Antholz-Anterselva]] in late January, Thingnes B\u00f8 was a close second to Fourcade in the overall World Cup.<ref>https://biathlonresults.com/</ref> Having dominated the preceding World Cup events, expectations were high for Thingnes B\u00f8 in the upcoming [[2018 Winter Olympics|Winter Olympics]] in [[Pyeongchang County|Pyeongchang]], [[South Korea]]. However, Thingnes B\u00f8 had a disappointing start to the games with a season-worst 31st place finish in the [[Biathlon at the 2018 Winter Olympics \u2013 Men's sprint|sprint race]]. The following [[Biathlon at the 2018 Winter Olympics \u2013 Men's pursuit|pursuit race]] ended little better for Thingnes B\u00f8, who finished 21st with six missed shots. In the [[Biathlon at the 2018 Winter Olympics \u2013 Men's individual|individual 20km race]], which is usually considered his weakest race discipline, Thingnes B\u00f8 finally managed to find his best level. Despite two misses, he won the competition with a small time gap to Slovenian [[Jakov Fak]] and Austrian [[Dominik Landertinger]] in third place. Rival Fourcade finished fifth with equal shooting, but trailed Thingnes B\u00f8 by a substantial amount of time.<ref>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biathlon_at_the_2018_Winter_Olympics_%E2%80%93_Men%27s_individual</ref> Thingnes B\u00f8 finished the Winter Olympics with a disappointing 16th place finish in the [[Biathlon at the 2018 Winter Olympics \u2013 Men's mass start|mass start race]], but managed to take two additional silver medals in the [[Biathlon at the 2018 Winter Olympics \u2013 Mixed relay|mixed relay]] and [[Biathlon at the 2018 Winter Olympics \u2013 Men's relay|men's relay]].\n\nFor the remainder of the season, Thingnes B\u00f8 continued to produce consistent results, despite not recording another win. He finished the [[2017\u201318 Biathlon World Cup|World Cup season]] as runner-up to overall winner Martin Fourcade.\n\n===2018/19 season: Setting new records for World Cup dominance===\n====The new king of biathlon====\nHaving come very close to beating Fourcade in the [[2017\u201318 Biathlon World Cup|previous World Cup season]], Thingnes B\u00f8 was widely considered the prime contender to Fourcade for the overall World Cup in [[2018\u201319 Biathlon World Cup|2018/19]].<ref>https://www.ispo.com/en/people/sponsors-and-successes-biathlon-stars-winter-2018/19</ref> But an injury-marred autumn with a back injury left severe question marks about Thingnes B\u00f8s shape for the beginning of the new season.<ref>https://www.langrenn.com/nye-problemer-for-johannes-thingnes-bo.6160623-1743.html</ref> These questions were made to shame, when Thingnes B\u00f8 found himself as the winner of the opening sprint race in [[Sjusj\u00f8en]] (not a part of the IBU World Cup calendar).<ref>https://www.langrenn.com/thingnes-bo-tok-apningsseieren-pa-sjusjoen.6168742-348438.html</ref> In the [[2018\u201319 Biathlon World Cup|initial World Cup events]] Thingnes B\u00f8 confirmed his great shape by winning six of eight individual races before [[Christmas]]. Having scored 428 points in eight races, Thingnes B\u00f8 lead the world cup by 116 points over Russian and former doping offender [[Alexander Loginov (biathlon)|Alexander Loginov]].<ref>https://ibu.blob.core.windows.net/docs/1819/BT/SWRL/CP03/SMMS/BT_C78B_1.0.pdf</ref> Meanwhile, the expected rival Martin Fourcade was in fifth place and trailing Thingnes B\u00f8 with 165 points. Thingnes B\u00f8 was now the hot favourite for winning the overall World Cup despite having only raced 8 out of a season-total of 26 individual races.\n\n====Podium streak in January====\nAfter Christmas break, Thingnes B\u00f8 continued to dominate the World Cup events. From and including the first world cup events in [[Oberhof]] until the world cup events in [[Soldier Hollow]], Thingnes B\u00f8 did not once leave the podium in an individual race.<ref>https://ibu.blob.core.windows.net/docs/1819/BT/SWRL/CP08/SMPU/BT_C78B_1.1.pdf</ref> At this point, Thingnes B\u00f8 had won 12 out 16 individual races (with one sprint race in Canmore being cancelled), while there were still 9 more individual races to go. However, Thingnes B\u00f8 did not manage to extend his streak of podium finishes in Soldier Hollow, where a sub-par standing shooting with four missed shots cost him the victory in [[2018\u201319 Biathlon World Cup \u2013 Stage 8|the initial sprint race]]. The following pursuit race saw Thingnes B\u00f8 deliver another mediocre performance on the shooting range as he finished fourth. Thingnes B\u00f8 later showed great sportsmanship and admitted that he had not fired all of his five shots at the last standing shooting. As a penalty for his offence, he agreed with the IBU to receive 0 instead of the 43 world cup points that his fourth-place finish would otherwise have netted him.<ref>https://www.biathlonworld.com/news/detail/ibu-boe-soho-pursuit</ref> The poor standing shooting in Soldier Hollow quickly fuelled considerations among experts and fans about whether Thingnes B\u00f8 would run into the same shooting problems in the upcoming [[Biathlon World Championships 2019|World Championships in \u00d6stersund]], where wind conditions are generally very difficult.<ref>https://www.vg.no/sport/skiskyting/i/4dpyOV/ekspert-om-thingnes-boe-litt-krise</ref>\n\n====World Championships in \u00d6stersund====\nThingnes B\u00f8 started the 2019 World Championships in strong fashion as he outskied everyone to take home the title as World Champion in the [[Biathlon World Championships 2019 \u2013 Men's sprint|sprint race]] - despite one missed shot (everyone else in the top eight shot clean), Thingnes B\u00f8 comfortably won the sprint race ahead of new rival Alexander Loginov, who was, at the time, still in second position in the overall world cup. The next race was the pursuit race, where Thingnes B\u00f8 was, by virtue of a large time advantage from the sprint race, the overwhelming favourite to take a second consecutive gold medal. Thingnes B\u00f8 lived up to his favourite status in the initial part of the race and lead the race with almost one minute coming into the last standing shooting. However, another breakdown on the shooting range meant that Ukrainian underdog [[Dmytro Pidruchnyi]] left the shooting range in first place with Thingnes B\u00f8 following in second place 15 seconds behind. Thingnes B\u00f8, surprisingly, did not catch Pidruchnyi on the final loop and had to settle for a silver medal after a dramatic last loop chase.<ref>https://ibu.blob.core.windows.net/docs/1819/BT/SWRL/CH__/SMPU/BT_C77D_1.0.pdf</ref> Thingnes B\u00f8 then delivered two disappointing performances in the Individual 20k (9th place) and the mass start (13th place). In the team events, however, Thingnes B\u00f8 won three additional gold medals.\n\n====New record-holder====\nHaving now won 13 races throughout the season and effectively securing himself the crystal globe as winner of the Overall World Cup, Thingnes B\u00f8 had only three more races left on home soil, in [[Holmenkollen]], before the season ended. The last world cup event in Holmenkollen turned out great for Thingnes B\u00f8, who took the victory in all three races.<ref>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018%E2%80%9319_Biathlon_World_Cup</ref> With 16 individual victories, he thus became the record holder of the most individual world cup races won in a single season as he smashed the previous record of 14 victories set by Martin Fourcade two years earlier in the 2016/17 season.<ref>https://www.aftenposten.no/sport/skiskyting/i/na4LBJ/boe-avsluttet-sesongen-med-perfekt-loep-det-gaar-ikke-an-aa-faa-en-flottere-avslutning</ref>\n\n===2019/20 season: Parental leave and another world cup title===\n====Pre-season speculations====\nArguably the main talking point coming into the [[2019\u201320 Biathlon World Cup|new season (2019/20)]] was whether Thingnes B\u00f8 could retain his dominance from the previous season.<ref>https://www.olympicchannel.com/en/stories/news/detail/biathlon-schedule-races-2020-preview/</ref> Most bookmakers, experts and fans predicted another Thingnes B\u00f8-victory in the world cup, although his favourite status had diminished with the knowledge that Thingnes B\u00f8 would have to leave for multiple world cup events in January because he had to go on parental leave.<ref>https://sport.tv2.dk/skisport/2019-11-30-punkterer-en-baby-alle-tiders-tvekamp</ref> Thingnes B\u00f8 dismissed the idea that he would even fight for the overall world cup title because of his January-absence, and he instead insisted that his goals were instead the [[Biathlon World Championships 2020|World Championships]]<ref>https://skisport.no/nyheter/thingnes-bo-tror-ikke-pa-drommereprise-mister-trolig-verdenscuprenn/</ref>, which were held in one of Biathlon's most iconic places, [[Rasen-Antholz|Antholz-Anterselva]].\n\n====Season-opening====\nThe non-official season-opening in [[Sjusj\u00f8en]] was not a success for Thingnes B\u00f8, who felt heavy on the tracks and only managed fourth in the sprint race, beaten by rival Fourcade who finished third with similar shooting.<ref>https://www.aftenposten.no/sport/skiskyting/i/opx0P7/thingnes-boe-gikk-seg-svimmel-det-var-grusomt</ref> In the first world cup competitions in [[\u00d6stersund]], Thingnes B\u00f8 turned things around in his own favour, and he convincingly took the yellow bib with an emphatic victory in the sprint race ahead of his elder brother, Tarjei. Just as Thingnes B\u00f8 looked like he was back to his best, disaster struck in the Individual 20k, where relatively poor Norwegian skis ruined Thingnes B\u00f8s competition. The French waxing team had found the perfect formula for the tricky snow conditions, and as a result, Thingnes B\u00f8 was passed by Fourcade who went on to take the yellow jersey from Thingnes B\u00f8 in an all-french-podium.<ref>https://www.nrk.no/sport/thingnes-bo-knust-av-fourcade-i-sporet_-_-darlegaste-pa-mange-ar-1.14808880</ref>\n\n====Dominance before Christmas====\nCasting aside the equipment failure in \u00d6stersund, Thingnes B\u00f8 found himself back on the top in the next World Cup stage in [[Hochfilzen]], where he won [[2019\u201320 Biathlon World Cup \u2013 Stage 2|both individual competitions]]. In the following world cup stage, Thingnes B\u00f8 once again spoiled the French party in [[Le Grand-Bornand]], [[Annecy]]. The outstanding ski speed of the previous season was starting to manifest itself again with Thingnes B\u00f8 taking an impressive fourth place finish in the sprint race despite shooting two misses. The pursuit race saw Thingnes B\u00f8 take another world cup victory, and the following mass start, where Thingnes B\u00f8 won by over 40 seconds to Emilien Jacquelin, cemented his status as the best biathlete in the world.<ref>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019%E2%80%9320_Biathlon_World_Cup_%E2%80%93_Stage_3</ref> Going into the Christmas break, Thingnes B\u00f8 had won five of seven individual competitions and secured an advantage of 61 points to his brother Tarjei who was second in the overall world cup.<ref>https://ibu.blob.core.windows.net/docs/1920/BT/SWRL/CP03/SMMS/BT_C78B_1.0.pdf</ref> \n\n====Return of the king====\nThingnes B\u00f8 did not compete in the two World Cup stages held in Oberhof and Ruhpolding, and first returned to the World Cup in [[Pokljuka]] in late January, where he showed his class by taking a victory and a second place in the two individual events. While not as dominant as before Christmas, Thingnes B\u00f8s return signalled that he was on the right tracks for the [[Biathlon World Championships 2020|World Championships]]. Thingnes B\u00f8's return also ruined Fourcade's run of victories in early January - a run that had netted Fourcade the yellow bib as leader of the world cup. After Pokljuka, Thingnes B\u00f8 was trailing Fourcade by 119 points in the World Cup, and another crystal globe looked like a difficult achievement for Thingnes B\u00f8.\n\n====World championships====\nThingnes B\u00f8 was the most successful male athlete at the World Championships with six medals in total, including three medals in individual competitions.<ref>https://sport.tv2.dk/skisport/2020-02-23-johannes-boe-knuser-rivalerne-og-saetter-vm-rekord</ref> The success did not come immediately for Thingnes B\u00f8, however. Still not in top shape after his absence in January, Thingnes B\u00f8 delivered a sub-par [[Biathlon World Championships 2020 \u2013 Men's sprint|sprint race]] to only finish fifth. The [[Biathlon World Championships 2020 \u2013 Men's pursuit|pursuit race]] indicated an increase in form, as Thingnes B\u00f8 managed to take the silver medal. Despite his status as the best skier in biathlon, Thingnes B\u00f8 lost the fight with Frenchman Emilien Jacquelin on the last loop, where a tactical blunder in the finale left Thingnes B\u00f8 vulnerable to Jacquelin's explosive sprint.<ref>https://www.biathlon-antholz.it/en/newsroom/16-02-2020-jacquelin-outdoes-the-superstar/17-192.html</ref> Thingnes B\u00f8 took another silver medal in the [[Biathlon World Championships 2020 \u2013 Men's individual|Individual 20k]], where he was beaten by rival Fourcade. A missed shot at the last standing shooting likely cost Thingnes B\u00f8 the gold medal, since a clean shooting would have sent him out on the last loop ahead of Fourcade.<ref>https://www.aftenposten.no/sport/skiskyting/i/opQVmK/erkerivalen-til-topps-da-vm-gullet-glapp-for-boe-irriterende-aa-se-paa</ref> With no individual gold medals to his name, pressure was high on Thingnes B\u00f8 in the last individual race of the championships, the men's [[Biathlon World Championships 2020 \u2013 Men's mass start|mass start]]. Thingnes B\u00f8 duly delivered, and secured the gold medal with clean 20/20 shooting and fast skiing. Having also won medals in all team events, he entered, Thingnes B\u00f8 managed to win six out of seven possible medals in the championships.\n\n====Nove Mesto and wax gate====\nIn early March, Thingnes B\u00f8 was in even better ski shape in the next World Cup events in [[Nov\u00e9 M\u011bsto na Morav\u011b]], [[Czech Republic]] (held with no spectators at the venue as a security measure against the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic|Covid-19 pandemic]]<ref>https://focusbiathlon.com/news/item/328-coronavirus-the-event-in-nove-mesto-will-be-without-spectators.html</ref>). Thingnes B\u00f8 skied incredibly fast and shot clean in the opening sprint race, which automatically catapulted him to another World Cup victory. The following mass start race saw Thingnes B\u00f8 deliver another masterclass performance, winning the race with three missed shots, and out-skiing French nemesis Emilien Jacquelin on the final loop. The race, much like the Individual 20k in \u00d6stersund the same season, was unusual, as the Norwegian and German waxing teams were unusually successful in their ski-waxing strategy.<ref>https://www.biathlonworld.com/news/detail/nove-mesto-hat-trick-johannes-thingnes-boe-powers-to-mass-start-win</ref> However, poor shooting from Thingnes B\u00f8 throughout the race meant that Thingnes B\u00f8 had to catch up after each shooting, and so he eventually managed to catch and pass Emilien Jacquelin on the final loop.\n\n====Corona-cancellations and securing the world cup====\nThe competitions in [[Kontiolahti]], the penultimate World Cup stage on the calendar, were also held with no spectators because of the fear for Covid-19 spread, and the mixed events were eventually cancelled.<ref>https://www.biathlonworld.com/news/detail/ibu-statement-on-world-cup-in-oslo</ref> For similar reasons, the competitions in [[Holmenkollen]] were also cancelled leaving only two races in Kontiolahti left in the season. Before these races, Thingnes B\u00f8 had already managed to overtake Fourcade in the overall World Cup, courtesy of the points system that subtracts the two worst scores of the season (Thingnes B\u00f8 could subtract 0 points because he did not start in two (four) competitions in January).<ref>http://www.realbiathlon.com/2013/03/world-cup-scoring-system-when-have-you.html</ref> However, Thingnes B\u00f8 only lead the World Cup with a slim advantage and he had to deliver two top results to keep the lead. Thingnes B\u00f8 did as expected and won the sprint race with Fourcade in second place. It was then made public that Fourcade planned to retire after the following pursuit race, and suddenly the pursuit race was looking to set the stage for a last battle between the two rivals.<ref>https://www.olympicchannel.com/en/stories/news/detail/martin-fourcade-announces-surprise-retirement-from-biathlon/</ref> Thingnes B\u00f8 secured his second overall world cup title with a fourth place in the pursuit, while Fourcade won the race and missed out on the overall world cup by three points.<ref>https://www.olympicchannel.com/en/stories/news/detail/martin-fourcade-wins-biathlon-race-as-thingnes-boe-takes-overall-world-cu/</ref>\n\n==Biathlon results==\nAll results are sourced from the [[International Biathlon Union]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://biathlonresults.com/|title=DATACENTER|website=biathlonresults.com|access-date=16 March 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.biathlonworld.com/athletes/johannes-thingnes-boe/id/btnor11605199301/|title=Johannes Thingnes Boe|website=International Biathlon Union \u2013 IBU|access-date=16 March 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Olympic Games===\n''3 medals (1 gold, 2 silver)''\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|- \"\n!style=\"width:200px;\"|Event\n!style=\"width:70px;\"|Individual\n!style=\"width:70px;\"|Sprint\n!style=\"width:70px;\"|Pursuit\n!style=\"width:70px;\"|{{nowrap|Mass start}}\n!style=\"width:70px;\"|Relay\n!style=\"width:70px;\"|{{nowrap|Mixed relay}}\n|-\n| align=left |{{flagicon|Russia}} [[Biathlon at the 2014 Winter Olympics|2014 Sochi]]\n| 11th\n| 54th\n| 32nd\n| 8th\n| 4th\n| \u2014\n|-\n| align=left |{{flagicon|South Korea}} [[Biathlon at the 2018 Winter Olympics|2018 Pyeongchang]]\n| style=\"background:gold;\"| '''Gold'''\n| 31st\n| 21st\n| 16th\n| style=\"background:silver;\"| '''Silver'''\n| style=\"background:silver;\"| '''Silver'''\n|}\n:''*The mixed relay was added as an event in 2014.''\n\n===World Championships===\n''20 medals (10 gold, 8 silver, 2 bronze)''\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|- \"\n!style=\"width:200px;\"|Event\n!style=\"width:70px;\"|Individual\n!style=\"width:70px;\"|Sprint\n!style=\"width:70px;\"|Pursuit\n!style=\"width:70px;\"|{{nowrap|Mass start}}\n!style=\"width:70px;\"|Relay\n!style=\"width:70px;\"|{{nowrap|Mixed relay}}\n!style=\"width:70px;\"|{{nowrap|Single mixed relay}}\n|-\n| align=left |{{flagicon|FIN}} [[Biathlon World Championships 2015|2015 Kontiolahti]]\n| 7th\n| style=\"background:gold;\"| '''Gold'''\n| 31st\n| 6th\n| style=\"background:silver;\"| '''Silver'''\n| style=\"background:#cfaa88;\"| '''Bronze'''\n| rowspan=\"3\" {{n/a}}\n|-\n| align=left |{{flagicon|NOR}} [[Biathlon World Championships 2016|2016 Oslo Holmenkollen]]\n|4th\n|4th\n|4th\n|style=\"background:gold;\"| '''Gold'''\n|style=\"background:gold;\"| '''Gold'''\n| style=\"background:#cfaa88;\"| '''Bronze'''\n|-\n| align=left |{{flagicon|AUT}} [[Biathlon World Championships 2017|2017 Hochfilzen]]\n| 8th\n| align=center bgcolor=silver| '''Silver'''\n| align=center bgcolor=silver| '''Silver'''\n| align=center bgcolor=silver| '''Silver'''\n| 8th\n| 8th\n|-\n| align=left |{{flagicon|SWE}} [[Biathlon World Championships 2019|2019 \u00d6stersund]]\n| 9th\n| style=\"background:gold;\"| '''Gold'''\n| style=\"background:silver;\"| '''Silver'''\n| 13th\n| style=\"background:gold;\"| '''Gold'''\n| style=\"background:gold;\"| '''Gold'''\n| style=\"background:gold;\"| '''Gold'''\n|-\n| align=left |{{flagicon|ITA}} [[Biathlon World Championships 2020|2020 Antholz-Anterselva]]\n| style=\"background:silver;\"| '''Silver'''\n| 5th\n| style=\"background:silver;\"| '''Silver'''\n| style=\"background:gold;\"| '''Gold'''\n| style=\"background:silver;\"| '''Silver'''\n| style=\"background:gold;\"| '''Gold'''\n| style=\"background:gold;\"| '''Gold'''\n|}\n\n\n:''*During Olympic seasons competitions are only held for those events not included in the Olympic program.''\n:''**The single mixed relay was added as an event in 2019.''\n\n===World Cup===\n====Season standings====\n{| class=wikitable style=\"text-align:center\"\n!Season !!

She then released her debut full-length studio album, ''[[Drama (Jamelia album)|Drama]]'', in June 2000. Jamelia went on to release further successful singles, including \"[[Superstar (Christine Milton song)#Jamelia_cover|Superstar]]\" which charted at number three on the [[UK Singles Chart]] respectively, with \"Superstar\" charting at number one in Australia and becoming platinum certified in Australia. She went on to further release another two studio albums, ''[[Thank You (Jamelia album)|Thank You]]'' (2003) and ''[[Walk with Me (Jamelia album)|Walk with Me]]'' (2006), before leaving [[Parlophone]] following a dispute with executives over the release of \"[[No More (Jamelia song)|No More]]\", the third offering from ''Walk with Me''.\n\nJamelia's ten-year-successful career span has led her to becoming a judge on shows such as ''[[Move Like Michael Jackson]]'' in 2009.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1478388/|title=Jamelia|publisher=IMDb.com|accessdate=27 June 2013}}</ref> Her filmography also includes her own TV documentaries, including ''Jamelia: Whose Hair Is It Anyway'' (2008), her own edition of the popular [[Channel 4]] show, ''The House That Made Me'' and in 2011, her own [[BBC Three]] documentary, ''Jamelia: Shame About Single Mums''. In 2010 she signed a new record deal with [[All Around the World Productions]]. She was a panellist on the ITV magazine show ''[[Loose Women]]'' from 2013 until 2016.\n\n==Early life==\nJamelia was born in [[Handsworth, West Midlands|Handsworth]], Birmingham to single mother Paulette Davis.

The single failed to chart in both the UK and mainland Europe, and did not appear on any of Jamelia's subsequent albums. Following the poor sales of the single, Jamelia left Capitol Records, but was quickly signed up with record company [[Parlophone]], a branch of [[EMI]].\n\nTaking some time to record her debut [[studio album]], ''[[Drama (Jamelia album)|Drama]]'' (2000), Jamelia returned to the music scene in 1999 with the single \"[[I Do (Jamelia song)|I Do]]\", which became her first commercially successful single in the UK and mainland Europe, making the UK Top 40 and holding Top 20 positions in France and Sweden. The single's mediocre chart success, however, led to the delay of the release of ''Money''. Jamelia's third single, \"[[Money (Jamelia song)|Money]]\" (featuring rapper [[Beenie Man]] and co-written by UK ''[[The X Factor (UK)|The X Factor]]'' finalist Daniel De Bourg), was released in February 2000. The single was the singer's breakthrough in the UK, peaking at number five and spending nine weeks in the UK Top 75; it later won a [[MOBO Awards|MOBO Award]] for Best Video in 2000. Despite the success of ''Money'', ''Drama'' did not make a major chart impression in the UK, where it peaked at number 39. The third single from the album, \"[[Call Me (Jamelia song)|Call Me]]\", reached number 11, and the fourth single, \"[[Boy Next Door (song)|Boy Next Door]]\", peaked at number 42. Recognition for the singer's early success came in late 2000 and 2001 at the [[BRIT Awards]]. Jamelia was nominated for Best British Newcomer, Best British Video and Best British Female.<ref name=Brits/>\n\n===2003\u20132005: ''Thank You'' and mainstream breakthrough===\nJamelia recorded her second studio album, ''[[Thank You (Jamelia album)|Thank You]]'', in 2002 and early 2003 following the birth of her daughter Teja in 2001. The first single lifted from ''Thank You'' was the R&B-influenced \"[[Bout (song)|Bout]]\", on which she collaborated with American rap star [[Rah Digga]]; it debuted at number 37 in the UK. The second single, the much poppier \"[[Superstar (Jamelia song)|Superstar]]\", became Jamelia's highest peaking at the time when it peaked at number three, and earned the spot of the 26th best-selling of 2003 in the UK. It remains Jamelia's only single to receive a BPI certification.<ref name=\"BPI\">[http://www.bpi.co.uk/certifiedawards/search.aspx Certified Awards Search] BPI {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090901062056/http://www.bpi.co.uk/certifiedawards/search.aspx|date=1 September 2009}}</ref> Parent album ''Thank You'', released shortly after \"Superstar\", was widely expected to replicate the single's success, but entered the UK chart at number 65. Subsequently, a number of record producers worked with Jamelia on a re-release of the album that featured new artwork and track listing, including two new songs: her collaboration with [[Coldplay]]'s [[Chris Martin]] and DJ K Staveley, \"[[See It in a Boy's Eyes]]\", and \"[[DJ (Jamelia song)|DJ]]\".\n\nPromoting the re-release, title track \"[[Thank You (Jamelia song)|Thank You]]\" was issued shortly before. Known to be Jamelia's favourite of her releases, the song became her highest charting single to date in the UK, where it peaked at number two and received the 2004 MOBO Award for Best Single and a [[BRIT Award]] nomination in the same category. The fourth single \"See it in a Boy's Eyes\" was released in mid-2004 and became Jamelia's third consecutive top five hit, winning a MOBO Award for Best Video and a [[Q Award]] for Best Single. The success of ''Thank You'' resulted in five [[BRIT Award]] nominations for Jamelia in 2004 and 2005 for Best British Female, Best British Single, Best Female Solo Act, and Best British Urban Act.<ref name=Brits/> The album became the 36th best-selling of 2004<ref>{{cite web|url=http://forums.morrissey-solo.com/archive/index.php/t-40867.html |title=YATQ at 61 in best selling albums of 2004 in the UK |work=Morrissey-solo Forums |date=1 January 2006 |accessdate=30 June 2014}}</ref> and was certified double platinum by the [[British Phonographic Industry|BPI]] in recognition of 600,000 copies shipped to retailers.<ref name=BPI/> Jamelia also contributed a cover version of [[Kool and the Gang]]'s \"Straight Ahead\" for their remix/covers album ''The Hits: Reloaded''.\n\nIn mid-2004, Jamelia collaborated with Italian singer [[Tiziano Ferro]] on \"[[Universal Prayer (song)|Universal Prayer]]\" for the [[2004 Summer Olympics|2004 Olympic Games]] soundtrack. It became her first Number 1 single in Italy and Spain and was added to non-UK editions of ''Thank You''. In late 2004, Jamelia was asked to contribute to the [[Band Aid (band)#Band Aid 20|Band Aid 20]] charity single \"[[Do They Know It's Christmas?]]\", on which she sang with [[Will Young]]. The single topped the UK Singles Chart and was certified platinum. Around the same time, Jamelia released the lead single from the soundtrack of the film ''[[Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason]]'', a cover of [[Sam Brown (singer)|Sam Brown]]'s 1988 single \"[[Stop! (Sam Brown song)|Stop!]]\"; it was released as double A-side in the UK with the aforementioned \"DJ\", and peaked at number nine. \n\nOn 9 November 2006, Jamelia joined [[Feeder (band)|Feeder]] on stage for the encore of Feeder's WAR Child gig at 'The Coronet' in London. They performed a cover of [[R.E.M.|REM]]'s \"Everybody Hurts\" as well as \"Beware of the Dog\".\n\n===2005\u20132007: ''Walk with Me'' and departure from Parlophone===\nFollowing the birth of her second daughter, Tiani, in 2005, Jamelia began recording her third album, ''[[Walk with Me (Jamelia album)|Walk with Me]]''. Its lead single, \"[[Something About You (Jamelia song)|Something About You]]\", was released in late 2006 and described as \"less R&B, more experimental\", with [[Popjustice]] hailing it as \"an incredible pop single\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.popjustice.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=1483&Itemid=279 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071014220534/http://popjustice.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=1483&Itemid=279 |url-status=dead |archive-date=14 October 2007 |title=100% Solid Pop Music |publisher=Popjustice |accessdate=30 June 2014}}</ref> The single became Jamelia's first to enter the charts solely on download sales alone, debuting at number 28, rising to number nine almost a month later following the physical release. ''Walk with Me'' was released shortly after and drew critical praise, with many critics claiming that it marked a significant turn in the singer's career as she moved from R&B to pop/rock.\n\nThe album did not emulate the chart success of ''Thank You'', managing to d\u00e9but only at number 20 on the UK Albums Chart. The second single, \"[[Beware of the Dog (song)|Beware of the Dog]]\", features a sample from [[Depeche Mode]]'s 1989 song \"[[Personal Jesus]]\" and was heavily praised as being Jamelia's best single to date, with [[BBC Radio 1]]'s \"Chart Blog\" stating that it \"might just be one of the best pop songs ever made\" and \"the best pop song of the year\", receiving a five-star rating.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/chartblog/2006/12/jamelia_beware_of_the_dog.shtml |title=Chart Blog: Jamelia \u2013 'Beware Of The Dog' |publisher=BBC Music|date=3 December 2006 |accessdate=13 April 2012}}</ref> The single became the second consecutive Top 10 effort from the singer's third album, reaching number 10 in the UK. The final single to be released from the album was \"[[No More (Jamelia song)|No More]]\", which samples The Stranglers' 1981 single \"[[Golden Brown]]\". It made the A-list on [[BBC Radio 2]], but failed to garner much sales success, debuting at number 43.\n\n''Walk with Me'' became Jamelia's second album to receive a BPI certification. After four months of release, it sold more than 100,000 copies and was awarded a Gold disk.<ref name=BPI/> However, despite producing two Top 10 singles and garnering mostly positive reviews, ''Walk With Me'' had disappointing sales compared to her second album, ''Thank You'', which went on to become certified double platinum.\n\nIn an interview with [[Digital Spy]] in December 2009, Jamelia said that she wasn't surprised that the album did not sell well. \"I probably wasn't in the right frame of mind with ''Walk With Me''... I love all the songs individually, but I don't feel it flows very well as an album, which makes it harder to relate to.

Jamelia went on to release further successful singles, including \"[[Superstar (Christine Milton song)#Jamelia_cover|Superstar]]\" which charted at number three on the [[UK Singles Chart]] respectively, with \"Superstar\" charting at number one in Australia and becoming platinum certified in Australia. She went on to further release another two studio albums, ''[[Thank You (Jamelia album)|Thank You]]'' (2003) and ''[[Walk with Me (Jamelia album)|Walk with Me]]'' (2006), before leaving [[Parlophone]] following a dispute with executives over the release of \"[[No More (Jamelia song)|No More]]\", the third offering from ''Walk with Me''.\n\nJamelia's ten-year-successful career span has led her to becoming a judge on shows such as ''[[Move Like Michael Jackson]]'' in 2009.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1478388/|title=Jamelia|publisher=IMDb.com|accessdate=27 June 2013}}</ref> Her filmography also includes her own TV documentaries, including ''Jamelia: Whose Hair Is It Anyway'' (2008), her own edition of the popular [[Channel 4]] show, ''The House That Made Me'' and in 2011, her own [[BBC Three]] documentary, ''Jamelia: Shame About Single Mums''.

The single failed to chart in both the UK and mainland Europe, and did not appear on any of Jamelia's subsequent albums. Following the poor sales of the single, Jamelia left Capitol Records, but was quickly signed up with record company [[Parlophone]], a branch of [[EMI]].\n\nTaking some time to record her debut [[studio album]], ''[[Drama (Jamelia album)|Drama]]'' (2000), Jamelia returned to the music scene in 1999 with the single \"[[I Do (Jamelia song)|I Do]]\", which became her first commercially successful single in the UK and mainland Europe, making the UK Top 40 and holding Top 20 positions in France and Sweden. The single's mediocre chart success, however, led to the delay of the release of ''Money''. Jamelia's third single, \"[[Money (Jamelia song)|Money]]\" (featuring rapper [[Beenie Man]] and co-written by UK ''[[The X Factor (UK)|The X Factor]]'' finalist Daniel De Bourg), was released in February 2000. The single was the singer's breakthrough in the UK, peaking at number five and spending nine weeks in the UK Top 75; it later won a [[MOBO Awards|MOBO Award]] for Best Video in 2000. Despite the success of ''Money'', ''Drama'' did not make a major chart impression in the UK, where it peaked at number 39. The third single from the album, \"[[Call Me (Jamelia song)|Call Me]]\", reached number 11, and the fourth single, \"[[Boy Next Door (song)|Boy Next Door]]\", peaked at number 42. Recognition for the singer's early success came in late 2000 and 2001 at the [[BRIT Awards]]. Jamelia was nominated for Best British Newcomer, Best British Video and Best British Female.<ref name=Brits/>\n\n===2003\u20132005: ''Thank You'' and mainstream breakthrough===\nJamelia recorded her second studio album, ''[[Thank You (Jamelia album)|Thank You]]'', in 2002 and early 2003 following the birth of her daughter Teja in 2001. The first single lifted from ''Thank You'' was the R&B-influenced \"[[Bout (song)|Bout]]\", on which she collaborated with American rap star [[Rah Digga]]; it debuted at number 37 in the UK. The second single, the much poppier \"[[Superstar (Jamelia song)|Superstar]]\", became Jamelia's highest peaking at the time when it peaked at number three, and earned the spot of the 26th best-selling of 2003 in the UK. It remains Jamelia's only single to receive a BPI certification.<ref name=\"BPI\">[http://www.bpi.co.uk/certifiedawards/search.aspx Certified Awards Search] BPI {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090901062056/http://www.bpi.co.uk/certifiedawards/search.aspx|date=1 September 2009}}</ref> Parent album ''Thank You'', released shortly after \"Superstar\", was widely expected to replicate the single's success, but entered the UK chart at number 65. Subsequently, a number of record producers worked with Jamelia on a re-release of the album that featured new artwork and track listing, including two new songs: her collaboration with [[Coldplay]]'s [[Chris Martin]] and DJ K Staveley, \"[[See It in a Boy's Eyes]]\", and \"[[DJ (Jamelia song)|DJ]]\".\n\nPromoting the re-release, title track \"[[Thank You (Jamelia song)|Thank You]]\" was issued shortly before. Known to be Jamelia's favourite of her releases, the song became her highest charting single to date in the UK, where it peaked at number two and received the 2004 MOBO Award for Best Single and a [[BRIT Award]] nomination in the same category. The fourth single \"See it in a Boy's Eyes\" was released in mid-2004 and became Jamelia's third consecutive top five hit, winning a MOBO Award for Best Video and a [[Q Award]] for Best Single. The success of ''Thank You'' resulted in five [[BRIT Award]] nominations for Jamelia in 2004 and 2005 for Best British Female, Best British Single, Best Female Solo Act, and Best British Urban Act.<ref name=Brits/> The album became the 36th best-selling of 2004<ref>{{cite web|url=http://forums.morrissey-solo.com/archive/index.php/t-40867.html |title=YATQ at 61 in best selling albums of 2004 in the UK |work=Morrissey-solo Forums |date=1 January 2006 |accessdate=30 June 2014}}</ref> and was certified double platinum by the [[British Phonographic Industry|BPI]] in recognition of 600,000 copies shipped to retailers.<ref name=BPI/> Jamelia also contributed a cover version of [[Kool and the Gang]]'s \"Straight Ahead\" for their remix/covers album ''The Hits: Reloaded''.\n\nIn mid-2004, Jamelia collaborated with Italian singer [[Tiziano Ferro]] on \"[[Universal Prayer (song)|Universal Prayer]]\" for the [[2004 Summer Olympics|2004 Olympic Games]] soundtrack. It became her first Number 1 single in Italy and Spain and was added to non-UK editions of ''Thank You''. In late 2004, Jamelia was asked to contribute to the [[Band Aid (band)#Band Aid 20|Band Aid 20]] charity single \"[[Do They Know It's Christmas?]]\", on which she sang with [[Will Young]]. The single topped the UK Singles Chart and was certified platinum. Around the same time, Jamelia released the lead single from the soundtrack of the film ''[[Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason]]'', a cover of [[Sam Brown (singer)|Sam Brown]]'s 1988 single \"[[Stop! (Sam Brown song)|Stop!]]\"; it was released as double A-side in the UK with the aforementioned \"DJ\", and peaked at number nine. \n\nOn 9 November 2006, Jamelia joined [[Feeder (band)|Feeder]] on stage for the encore of Feeder's WAR Child gig at 'The Coronet' in London. They performed a cover of [[R.E.M.|REM]]'s \"Everybody Hurts\" as well as \"Beware of the Dog\".\n\n===2005\u20132007: ''Walk with Me'' and departure from Parlophone===\nFollowing the birth of her second daughter, Tiani, in 2005, Jamelia began recording her third album, ''[[Walk with Me (Jamelia album)|Walk with Me]]''. Its lead single, \"[[Something About You (Jamelia song)|Something About You]]\", was released in late 2006 and described as \"less R&B, more experimental\", with [[Popjustice]] hailing it as \"an incredible pop single\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.popjustice.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=1483&Itemid=279 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071014220534/http://popjustice.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=1483&Itemid=279 |url-status=dead |archive-date=14 October 2007 |title=100% Solid Pop Music |publisher=Popjustice |accessdate=30 June 2014}}</ref> The single became Jamelia's first to enter the charts solely on download sales alone, debuting at number 28, rising to number nine almost a month later following the physical release. ''Walk with Me'' was released shortly after and drew critical praise, with many critics claiming that it marked a significant turn in the singer's career as she moved from R&B to pop/rock.\n\nThe album did not emulate the chart success of ''Thank You'', managing to d\u00e9but only at number 20 on the UK Albums Chart. The second single, \"[[Beware of the Dog (song)|Beware of the Dog]]\", features a sample from [[Depeche Mode]]'s 1989 song \"[[Personal Jesus]]\" and was heavily praised as being Jamelia's best single to date, with [[BBC Radio 1]]'s \"Chart Blog\" stating that it \"might just be one of the best pop songs ever made\" and \"the best pop song of the year\", receiving a five-star rating.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/chartblog/2006/12/jamelia_beware_of_the_dog.shtml |title=Chart Blog: Jamelia \u2013 'Beware Of The Dog' |publisher=BBC Music|date=3 December 2006 |accessdate=13 April 2012}}</ref> The single became the second consecutive Top 10 effort from the singer's third album, reaching number 10 in the UK. The final single to be released from the album was \"[[No More (Jamelia song)|No More]]\", which samples The Stranglers' 1981 single \"[[Golden Brown]]\". It made the A-list on [[BBC Radio 2]], but failed to garner much sales success, debuting at number 43.\n\n''Walk with Me'' became Jamelia's second album to receive a BPI certification. After four months of release, it sold more than 100,000 copies and was awarded a Gold disk.<ref name=BPI/> However, despite producing two Top 10 singles and garnering mostly positive reviews, ''Walk With Me'' had disappointing sales compared to her second album, ''Thank You'', which went on to become certified double platinum.\n\nIn an interview with [[Digital Spy]] in December 2009, Jamelia said that she wasn't surprised that the album did not sell well. \"I probably wasn't in the right frame of mind with ''Walk With Me''... I love all the songs individually, but I don't feel it flows very well as an album, which makes it harder to relate to. It sold well over 100,000 copies \u2013 but I want double-platinum every time!\"<ref name=DigSpy1>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/tv/interviews/a190538/jamelia.html |title=Jamelia \u2013 TV Interview |publisher=Hearst UK|work=Digital Spy |date=11 December 2009 |accessdate=30 June 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn late 2007, the singer released a singles collection titled ''[[Superstar - The Hits]]''.
