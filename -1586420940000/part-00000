She is from a wealthier middle-class family and even has a chauffeur drive her to and from school. Her parents are divorced, and she hardly ever sees her disinterested father, the quintessential Latino playboy, much to her dismay. Instead, she resides with her remarried mother and stepfather in a gated property on the outskirts of Lima, cared for primarily by servants while they travel abroad.\n\nThe film begins with a picture show and an unseen narrator recounting the fatal sacrifices former Peruvian military leaders made for their country. The scene then cuts to a classroom full of girls as a siren suddenly goes off and the children are evacuated from the building. A driver picks her up from school referring to her as Miss Cayetana, but she is unfazed by the status and remains mostly silent on the way home though at one point when a beggar approaches car she offers him her medication and comments that it suppresses the appetite.\n\nAt home later, Cayetana sits alone at the table in front of a full plate of food and doesn't touch it at all, until a maid scolds her and clears the table. The maids fuss over her in the morning so that she looks pretty for her mother's return, but she has to be dragged out of the closet in which she is hiding to go meet her mother because she doesn't want to see her. Eventually, she sits stiffly on her mother's lap as her stepfather looks on and gives her gifts, but the reunion doesn't last long when Cayetana reacts to her mother's pregnancy news by storming out of the room into her bedroom. She then decides to run away, but gets lost and is forced to return home. It is then she decides to punish her mother by withdrawing all affections and dying on the baby's delivery date.\n\nAt school, her cousin Jimena, who is chronically ill, is a source of companionship and reprieve, following her to the bathroom when she dumps her lunch in the trash and offering to share her own lunch. Cayetana withdraws even deeper into herself and begins to act out at home. Her worried parents' send her away on vacation to Lima with Jimena's family after the holiday festivities, not knowing what else to do with her.\n\nThe vacation is pleasant with boating, swimming, playing on the beach with Jimena, and leisurely meals. For the first time in a long while, Cayetana is truly content and happy, until her mother and stepfather arrive unannounced hoping to surprise Cayetana. She refuses to hug or even speak to her by now noticeably pregnant mother. Jimena suffers a medical emergency one night and is whisked off to hospital leaving Cayetana to wander the beach alone eventually climbing a very steep sand dune and experiencing a hallucination/vision of the Peruvian heroes and Jimena, who tells her that she loves and will always watch over her.\n\nWhen Cayetana is dropped off at vacation's end it is obvious that the political situation has worsened significantly, as her house has been robbed. Soon Cayetana's mother and stepfather leave for the hospital, leaving her once again with the servants. A few days later, she is taken to the hospital and dropped off to see her newborn half-brother. While there she wanders the wards aimlessly ending up outside the door of Jimena's room where a doctor is testing the latter with coordination exercises and helps Jimena do the test by miming the actions unseen by the doctor. It is clear that Jimena's mind is no longer all there and she is incredibly weak, not recognizing Cayetana at all. When Cayetana finally makes her way to the maternity ward and nursery, she picks the wrong baby out as her mother's son for some reason and hisses with obvious jealousy that she will not be upstaged by him. She no longer wants to die. From there she goes into where the babies are kept in the hospital and finds her new baby brother.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[F\u00e1tima Buntinx]] as Cayetana\n* [[Katerina D'Onofrio]] as In\u00e9s\n* [[Melchor Gorroch\u00e1tegui]] as Isaac\n* [[Kani Hart]] as Jimena\n* [[Jean-Paul Strauss]] as Francisco\n* [[Paul Vega]] as Ram\u00f3n\n\n==Soundtrack==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!  style=\"text-align:center; width:180px;\"|Title\n! style=\"text-align:center;\"|Songwriters\n!  style=\"text-align:center; width:180px;\"|Performers\n|-\n|\"La Negrita\"<ref name=\"MUSICA\">{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1696181/soundtrack|title=Las Malas Intenciones (2011) - Soundtracks|accessdate=16 June 2013 |work=IMDb.com|publisher=Internet Movie Database|year=2011}}</ref>\n| ''Traditional''\n|Rosario Garc\u00eda-Montero\n|-\n|\"La Catalina\"<ref name=\"MUSICA\" />\n|''Traditional'' (Spain)\n|Rosario Garc\u00eda-Montero\n|-\n|\"A la molina no voy mas\"<ref name=\"MUSICA\" />\n|''Traditional'' (Peru)\n|Rosario Garc\u00eda-Montero\n|-\n|\"Tengo una muneca\"<ref name=\"MUSICA\" />\n|''Traditional''\n|Rosario Garc\u00eda-Montero\n|-\n|\"Es mi vida\"<ref name=\"MUSICA\" />\n| [[Salvatore Adamo]], [[EMI Music]]\n| [[Salvatore Adamo]]\n|}\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of submissions to the 85th Academy Awards for Best Foreign Language Film]]\n* [[List of Peruvian submissions for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|1696181|Las Malas Intenciones}}\n* {{Official website|1=http://www.lasmalasintenciones.com}}\n* {{Official facebook page|1=las.malas.intenciones}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Bad Intentions}}\n[[Category:2011 films]]\n[[Category:Peruvian films]]\n[[Category:Peruvian drama films]]\n[[Category:Spanish-language films]]\n[[Category:2011 drama films]]\n[[Category:Films about terrorism]]\n[[Category:Films set in the 1980s]]\n[[Category:Internal conflict in Peru]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|2011 film}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=February 2019}}\n{{Infobox film\n| name           = The Bad Intentions\n| image          = Las.Malas.Intenciones.2011.Poster.jpg\n| caption        = Theatrical Poster\n| film name      = Las Malas Intenciones\n| director       = [[Rosario Garc\u00eda-Montero]]\n| producer       = Benito Mueller, Wolfgang Mueller, Rosario Garcia-Montero, Paul Typaldos\n| writer         = Rosario Garcia-Montero\n| starring       = [[Fatima Buntinx]]\n| music          = \n| cinematography = Rodrigo Pulpeiro\n| editing        = Rosario Suarez\n| studio         = Barry Films, Garmont Films\n| distributor    = Ondamax Films (World-wide), 3C Films Group (Argentina)\n| released       = {{Film date|2011|2||Berlin|2011|10|13|Peru|df=yes}}\n| runtime        = 110 minutes\n| country        = Peru\n| language       = Spanish\n| budget         = \n}}\n\n'''''The Bad Intentions''''' ({{lang-es|'''Las malas intenciones'''}}) is a 2011 Peruvian [[drama film]] written and directed by [[Rosario Garc\u00eda-Montero]].<ref>{{cite book |title=International Film Guide 2012 |first=Ian Hayden |last=Smith |year= 2012 |isbn= 978-1908215017 |page= 57}}</ref> The film premiered at the [[61st Berlin International Film Festival]] in 2011.<ref name=\"Berlin\">{{cite web |url=http://www.berlinale.de/en/archiv/jahresarchive/2011/02_programm_2011/02_Filmdatenblatt_2011_20110648.php |title=Las Malas Intenciones |accessdate=16 June 2013 |work=Berlin}}</ref> It won the award for Best Latin American Feature Film at the 2011 [[Mar del Plata Film Festival]].<ref name=\"Mar del Plata\">{{cite web|url=http://www.mardelplatafilmfest.com/26/en/news/11.13.2011.in_mar_del_plata,_everything_was_cinema |title=In Mar del Plata, everything was Cinema |accessdate=6 April 2012 |work=Mar del Plata}}</ref> It was also selected as the Peruvian entry for the [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film|Best Foreign Language Oscar]] at the [[85th Academy Awards]], but it did not make the final shortlist.<ref name=\"Oscar-entry\">{{cite news |url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118059913/ |title='Bad' is good for Peru |accessdate=27 September 2012 |date=26 September 2012 |work=Variety |publisher=Reed Business Information |last=De La Fuente |first=Anna Marie }}</ref>  The film's lead actress F\u00e1tima Buntinx was nominated for a [[Young Artist Award]] as [[34th Young Artist Awards#Best Performance in an International Feature Film - Young Actress|Best Young Actress in an International Feature Film]].<ref name=\"Young Artist Awards 34\">{{cite web|url=http://www.youngartistawards.org/noms34.html|title=34th Annual Young Artist Awards|accessdate=31 March 2013|work=YoungArtistAwards.org}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n\nCayetana de los Heros is a lonely and solemn 8-year-old child growing up in Peru during the turbulent 1980s.

In 1938 an Act of the [[New South Wales Parliament]] created a \"City of Greater Newcastle\", incorporating 11 municipalities into one local government area, including Waratah. Until it was subdivided by Scholey and the land put up for sale, it was largely semi-forested scrub and fields. However, St Andrew's Church at North Waratah was opened as early as 1861, and fell within the [[Church of England]] [[Diocese of Newcastle, New South Wales]]. In 1924 a new church was dedicated at St.Andrews, Mayfield, to replace the aging colonial church.\n\nMayfield was originally a pleasant garden suburb on the outskirts of Newcastle, and by 1901 contained a Roman Catholic monastery, and several fine [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] mansions belonging to prominent businessmen and lawyers. Of note, there was N.B.Creer (three times Mayor of Waratah), [[Charles Upfold]] (Soap Manufacturer) built a large mansion on a piece of land in Crebert Street, North Waratah (now called Mayfield), given to him by his friend John Scholey. It was later sold to [[Arnott's Biscuits Holdings|biscuit manufacturer]], William Arnott who named the mansion ''\"Arnott Holme\"''. Arnott then sold it in 1898 to Isaac Winn, owner of the big Newcastle department store. Winn renamed the mansion ''\"Winn Court\"''<ref>Newcastle Morning Herald dated Saturday 13 November 1965</ref> and John Scholey's ''\"Mayfield House\"'', for which the sandstone was brought from England. [[BHP]] constructed, in the early 1920s, a very fine mansion in Crebert Street (named after Peter Crebert [1825-1895], an immigrant from [[Wiesbaden]] in [[Germany]]), with extensive gardens, for their General Manager. Now privately owned and named The Bella Vista, it is used as a weddings and functions centre.\n\n=== Arrival of industry ===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2018}}\nIn 1896, the [[BHP|Broken Hill Proprietary Company]] acquired land on the river shore at Mayfield East for [[smelter]]s, and in 1910 it was decided that they would construct here a major steel works and foundries, with a 350-ton [[blast furnace]] and three 65-ton open hearth steel furnaces, a bloom mill and heavy rail mill, with by-product [[Coke (fuel)|coke]] ovens to supply coke for the blast furnaces. The advantages of the site played a major part in this decision: for transport both rail and shipping already existed, and they had close proximity to the Newcastle and [[South Maitland coalfields]], (the coal consumption in 1947 was 30,000 tons each week). The task of reclaiming swampland at Port Waratah for the main site began in January 1913, and the New South Wales Government undertook to [[dredge]] and maintain a river channel between the works and the sea, {{convert|500|ft|m}} wide and {{convert|25|ft|m}} deep at low water to the steelwork's basin and wharves. Altogether the company acquired {{convert|1225|acre|km2}}. The blast furnace commenced operations in March 1915.\n\nOther industries followed, such as galvanized iron manufacturers [[Lysaght (Australian company)|John Lysaght & Co.]], (1921), Rylands Bros (wire, nails, rivets, bolts, springs etc.), tubemakers Stewarts & Lloyds (1934), and the Newcastle Chemical Co, (1940), and sited themselves adjacent to the steel works. The result was pollution which began to affect Mayfield which lost its fashionable status. The housing erected during and after [[World War I]] was overwhelmingly for those with employment in the heavy industries. A large proportion of the Steel Works closed down in September 1999 which had a knock on effect with adjacent industries, several of whom were now struggling with developing world markets. The remaining steel mills which are Australian Tube Mills, Newcastle Wire Mill and Rod Mill remain in operation to this day under the company of Liberty Steel.\n\n== Today ==\nToday Mayfield is the most culturally diverse suburb in Newcastle and home to over 14,000 residents from all over the world.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nImage:Maitland_Rd_0.JPG|Shops on the corner of Hanbury Street and Maitland Road\nImage:Maitland_Rd_1.JPG|Shopping district along Maitland Road\nImage:Maitland_Rd_2.JPG|Shopping district along Maitland Road\nImage:Mayfield_History_Mosiac1.jpg|History of Mayfield mosaic located on the corner of Hanbury Street and Maitland Road\nImage:Mayfield_History_Mosiac2.jpg|A closeup of the History of Mayfield mosaic located on the corner of Hanbury Street and Maitland Road\nImage:Mayfield_Hotel.JPG|The Mayfield Hotel on Maitland Road\nImage:Mayfield_Industrial.jpg|Smorgon Steel works located in the residential area of Mayfield\nFile:Mayfield Catholic Church St Columban's.jpg|Mayfield Catholic Church of St Columban's.\nImage:Mayfield_Map_Mosiac1.jpg|A mosaic map of Mayfield located on the corner of Hanbury Street and Maitland Road\nImage:Mayfield_old_house1.JPG|''Winahra'' is a grand old Victorian style house located on the corner of Hanbury Street and Highfield Street.\nImage:Mayfield_old_house2.JPG|A well maintained old house located on Highfield Street\nImage:Mayfield_Streetscape.jpg|A view south towards Merewether Heights, overlooking residential housing\nImage:Mayfield_Woolworths.jpg|Woolworths Supermarket, Mayfield\nImage:Texas_Street.jpg|Texas Street, a typical residential street in Mayfield\nImage:Webb_Park.JPG|Webb Park is located on the corner of Waratah and Hanbury Streets\nImage:New_Architecture.JPG|This set of townhouses was built as retirement homes for the local convent.

In 1938 an Act of the [[New South Wales Parliament]] created a \"City of Greater Newcastle\", incorporating 11 municipalities into one local government area, including Waratah. Until it was subdivided by Scholey and the land put up for sale, it was largely semi-forested scrub and fields. However, St Andrew's Church at North Waratah was opened as early as 1861, and fell within the [[Church of England]] [[Diocese of Newcastle, New South Wales]]. In 1924 a new church was dedicated at St.Andrews, Mayfield, to replace the aging colonial church.\n\nMayfield was originally a pleasant garden suburb on the outskirts of Newcastle, and by 1901 contained a Roman Catholic monastery, and several fine [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] mansions belonging to prominent businessmen and lawyers. Of note, there was N.B.Creer (three times Mayor of Waratah), [[Charles Upfold]] (Soap Manufacturer) built a large mansion on a piece of land in Crebert Street, North Waratah (now called Mayfield), given to him by his friend John Scholey. It was later sold to [[Arnott's Biscuits Holdings|biscuit manufacturer]], William Arnott who named the mansion ''\"Arnott Holme\"''. Arnott then sold it in 1898 to Isaac Winn, owner of the big Newcastle department store. Winn renamed the mansion ''\"Winn Court\"''<ref>Newcastle Morning Herald dated Saturday 13 November 1965</ref> and John Scholey's ''\"Mayfield House\"'', for which the sandstone was brought from England. [[BHP]] constructed, in the early 1920s, a very fine mansion in Crebert Street (named after Peter Crebert [1825-1895], an immigrant from [[Wiesbaden]] in [[Germany]]), with extensive gardens, for their General Manager. Now privately owned and named The Bella Vista, it is used as a weddings and functions centre.\n\n=== Arrival of industry ===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2018}}\nIn 1896, the [[BHP|Broken Hill Proprietary Company]] acquired land on the river shore at Mayfield East for [[smelter]]s, and in 1910 it was decided that they would construct here a major steel works and foundries, with a 350-ton [[blast furnace]] and three 65-ton open hearth steel furnaces, a bloom mill and heavy rail mill, with by-product [[Coke (fuel)|coke]] ovens to supply coke for the blast furnaces. The advantages of the site played a major part in this decision: for transport both rail and shipping already existed, and they had close proximity to the Newcastle and [[South Maitland coalfields]], (the coal consumption in 1947 was 30,000 tons each week). The task of reclaiming swampland at Port Waratah for the main site began in January 1913, and the New South Wales Government undertook to [[dredge]] and maintain a river channel between the works and the sea, {{convert|500|ft|m}} wide and {{convert|25|ft|m}} deep at low water to the steelwork's basin and wharves. Altogether the company acquired {{convert|1225|acre|km2}}. The blast furnace commenced operations in March 1915.\n\nOther industries followed, such as galvanized iron manufacturers [[Lysaght (Australian company)|John Lysaght & Co.]], (1921), Rylands Bros (wire, nails, rivets, bolts, springs etc.), tubemakers Stewarts & Lloyds (1934), and the Newcastle Chemical Co, (1940), and sited themselves adjacent to the steel works. The result was pollution which began to affect Mayfield which lost its fashionable status. The housing erected during and after [[World War I]] was overwhelmingly for those with employment in the heavy industries. A large proportion of the Steel Works closed down in September 1999 which had a knock on effect with adjacent industries, several of whom were now struggling with developing world markets. The remaining steel mills which are Australian Tube Mills, Newcastle Wire Mill and Rod Mill remain in operation to this day under the company of Liberty Steel.\n\n== Today ==\nToday Mayfield is the most culturally diverse suburb in Newcastle and home to over 14,000 residents from all over the world.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nImage:Maitland_Rd_0.JPG|Shops on the corner of Hanbury Street and Maitland Road\nImage:Maitland_Rd_1.JPG|Shopping district along Maitland Road\nImage:Maitland_Rd_2.JPG|Shopping district along Maitland Road\nImage:Mayfield_History_Mosiac1.jpg|History of Mayfield mosaic located on the corner of Hanbury Street and Maitland Road\nImage:Mayfield_History_Mosiac2.jpg|A closeup of the History of Mayfield mosaic located on the corner of Hanbury Street and Maitland Road\nImage:Mayfield_Hotel.JPG|The Mayfield Hotel on Maitland Road\nImage:Mayfield_Industrial.jpg|Smorgon Steel works located in the residential area of Mayfield\nFile:Mayfield Catholic Church St Columban's.jpg|Mayfield Catholic Church of St Columban's.\nImage:Mayfield_Map_Mosiac1.jpg|A mosaic map of Mayfield located on the corner of Hanbury Street and Maitland Road\nImage:Mayfield_old_house1.JPG|''Winahra'' is a grand old Victorian style house located on the corner of Hanbury Street and Highfield Street.\nImage:Mayfield_old_house2.JPG|A well maintained old house located on Highfield Street\nImage:Mayfield_Streetscape.jpg|A view south towards Merewether Heights, overlooking residential housing\nImage:Mayfield_Woolworths.jpg|Woolworths Supermarket, Mayfield\nImage:Texas_Street.jpg|Texas Street, a typical residential street in Mayfield\nImage:Webb_Park.JPG|Webb Park is located on the corner of Waratah and Hanbury Streets\nImage:New_Architecture.JPG|This set of townhouses was built as retirement homes for the local convent.
