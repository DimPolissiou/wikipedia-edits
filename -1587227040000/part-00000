There are many techniques used to aid this process. One of these processes would be heat treatment. Heat treatment ceases bacterial and enzyme activity which then leads to decreasing the chances of low quality foods while maintaining the life of non-perishable foods. A specific type of heat treatment used would be UHT (Ultra-High Temperature) Sterilization. This type of heat treatment focuses on sterilization over 100 degrees Celsius. Two other types of sterilization are moist and dry heat sterilization. During moist heat sterilization, the temperatures that are used vary from 110 to 130 degrees Celsius. The minimum amount of time that sterilization would take place with moist heat would be 20 minutes and 40 minutes being the maximum. In other words, the higher the heat, the time for sterilization shortens. The use of dry heat sterilization uses longer times of susceptibility that may last up to 2 hours and that use much higher temperatures compared to moist heat sterilization. These temperatures may range from 160 to 180 degrees Celsius.\n\n===Medicine and surgery===\n[[File:Joseph Lister c1855.jpg|thumb|160px|[[Joseph Lister, 1st Baron Lister|Joseph Lister]] was a pioneer of [[antiseptic#Usage in surgery|antiseptic surgery]].]]\n[[File:Der Apparat zur Sterilisierung der Operationsinstrumente - CH-BAR - 3240236.tif|thumb|Apparatus to sterilize surgical instruments, Verwaltungsgeb\u00e4ude der Schweiz.

Examples of such instruments include [[scalpel]]s, [[hypodermic needle]]s, and [[artificial pacemaker]]s. This is also essential in the manufacture of [[wikt:parenteral|parenteral]] pharmaceuticals.\n\nPreparation of injectable medications and intravenous solutions for [[fluid replacement]] therapy requires not only sterility but also well-designed containers to prevent entry of [[infection|adventitious agents]] after initial product sterilization.\n\nMost medical and surgical devices used in healthcare facilities are made of materials that are able to go under [[steam]] sterilization.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Rutala|first=W.

[[Ethylene oxide]] gas has been used since the 1950s for heat- and moisture-sensitive medical devices. Within the past 15 years, a number of new, low-temperature sterilization systems (e.g., [[vaporized hydrogen peroxide]], [[peracetic acid]] immersion, [[ozone]]) have been developed and are being used to sterilize medical devices.<ref>[https://www.cdc.gov/hicpac/Disinfection_Sterilization/13_0Sterilization.html] {{PD-notice}}</ref>\n\nSteam sterilization is the most widely used and the most dependable.

Standards vary depending on both the type of mission and its destination; the more likely a planet is considered to be [[planetary habitability|habitable]], the stricter the requirements are.\n\nMany components of instruments used on spacecraft cannot withstand very high temperatures, so techniques not requiring excessive temperatures are used as tolerated, including heating to at least {{Cvt|120|C|}}, chemical sterilization, oxidization, ultraviolet, and irradiation.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://sci.esa.int/home/30313-no-bugs-please-this-is-a-clean-planet/ |title=No bugs please, this is a clean planet! |publisher=European Space Agency |date=30 July 2002 |accessdate=7 August 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Quantification==\nThe aim of sterilization is the reduction of initially present microorganisms or other potential pathogens. The degree of sterilization is commonly expressed by multiples of the decimal reduction time, or [[D-value (microbiology)|D-value]], denoting the time needed to reduce the initial number <math>N_0</math> to one tenth (<math>10^{-1}</math>) of its original value.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.fda.gov/RegulatoryInformation/Guidances/ucm071261.htm|title= Guidance for Industry: Biological Indicators|date= 4 October 2007|accessdate= |website= |publisher= United States [[Food and Drug Administration]]|last= |first=}}</ref> Then the number of microorganisms <math>N</math> after sterilization time <math>t</math> is given by:\n:<math>\\frac{N}{N_0}= 10^{\\left(-\\frac{t}{D}\\right)}</math>.\nThe D-value is a function of sterilization conditions and varies with the type of microorganism, [[temperature]], [[water activity]], [[pH]] etc.. For steam sterilization (see below) typically the temperature, in degrees [[Celsius]], is given as an index.\n\nTheoretically, the likelihood of the survival of an individual microorganism is never zero. To compensate for this, the overkill method is often used. Using the overkill method, sterilization is performed by sterilizing for longer than is required to kill the [[bioburden]] present on or in the item being sterilized. This provides a [[sterility assurance level]] (SAL) equal to the probability of a non-sterile unit.\n\nFor high-risk applications, such as medical devices and injections, a sterility assurance level of at least 10<sup>\u22126</sup> is required by the United States [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA).<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/UCM070342.pdf|title= Guidance for Industry: Sterile Drug Products Produced by Aseptic Processing|date= September 2004|accessdate= |website= |publisher= United States [[Food and Drug Administration]]|last= |first=}}</ref>\n\n==Heat==\n\n===Steam===\n{{See also|Moist heat sterilization}}\n\nA widely used method for heat sterilization is the [[autoclave]], sometimes called a converter or steam sterilizer. Autoclaves use steam heated to {{Cvt|121\u2013134|C|}} under [[pressure]]. To achieve sterility, the article is placed in a chamber and heated by injected steam until the article reaches a temperature and time setpoint. Almost all the air is removed from the chamber, because air is undesired in the moist heat sterilization process (this is one trait that differs from a typical pressure cooker used for food cooking). The article is held at the temperature setpoint for a period of time which varies depending on what [[bioburden]] is present on the article being sterilized and its resistance ([[D-value (microbiology)|D-value]]) to steam sterilization. A general cycle would be anywhere between 3 and 15 minutes, (depending on the generated heat)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lso-inc.com/sterilization-validation-services/iso17665-steam-sterilization.html|title=Steam Sterilization for Medical Devices - ISO 17665 - Sterilization Validation Services|website=www.lso-inc.com}}</ref> at {{Cvt|121|C|}} at {{Cvt|100|kPa|}}, which is sufficient to provide a sterility assurance level of 10<sup>\u22124</sup> for a product with a bioburden of 10<sup>6</sup> and a D-value of 2.0 minutes.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.sterislifesciences.com/sitecore/content/Sites/LifeSciences_com/Home/News-and-Events/News/2013/November/~/media/Files/LifeSciences_com/PDF/13ND-Dion.ashx|title= Steam Sterilization Principles|date= November 2013|accessdate= |website= |publisher= STERIS Life Sciences|last= |first=}}</ref> Following sterilization, liquids in a pressurized autoclave must be cooled slowly to avoid boiling over when the pressure is released. This may be achieved by gradually depressurizing the sterilization chamber and allowing liquids to evaporate under a negative pressure, while cooling the contents.\n\nProper autoclave treatment will inactivate all resistant bacterial [[spore]]s in addition to [[fungi]], bacteria, and viruses, but is not expected to eliminate all [[prion]]s, which vary in their resistance. For prion elimination, various recommendations state {{Cvt|121\u2013132|C|}} for 60 minutes or {{Cvt|134|C|}} for at least 18 minutes.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Rutala|first=William A.|last2=Weber|first2=David J.|last3=Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America|date=February 2010|title=Guideline for disinfection and sterilization of prion-contaminated medical instruments|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20055640|journal=Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology|volume=31|issue=2|pages=107\u2013117|doi=10.1086/650197|issn=1559-6834|pmid=20055640}}</ref> The 263K [[scrapie]] prion is inactivated relatively quickly by such sterilization procedures; however, other strains of scrapie, and strains of [[Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease]] (CKD) and [[bovine spongiform encephalopathy]] (BSE) are more resistant. Using [[laboratory mouse|mice]] as test animals, one experiment showed that heating BSE positive [[brain]] tissue at {{Cvt|134\u2013138|C|}} for 18 minutes resulted in only a 2.5 [[logarithm|log]] decrease in prion infectivity.<ref>http://web.tma.uz/gps/wp-content/uploads/sites/13/2015/09/ASEPSIS-ANTISEPTICS-INTRODUCTION.pdf</ref>\n\nMost autoclaves have meters and charts that record or display information, particularly temperature and pressure as a function of time. The information is checked to ensure that the conditions required for sterilization have been met. [[Autoclave tape|Indicator tape]] is often placed on the packages of products prior to autoclaving, and some packaging incorporates indicators. The indicator changes color when exposed to steam, providing a visual confirmation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/post/When_using_autoclave_we_use_autoclave_tape_which_changes_color_to_black_indicating_autoclaving_was_successful_what_is_the_molecular_mechanism|title=When using autoclave we use autoclave tape which changes color to black indicating autoclaving was successful, what is the molecular mechanism?|website=ResearchGate|access-date=2018-09-09}}</ref>\n\n[[Bioindicators]] can also be used to independently confirm autoclave performance. Simple bioindicator devices are commercially available, based on microbial spores. Most contain spores of the heat-resistant microbe ''[[Geobacillus stearothermophilus]]'' (formerly ''Bacillus stearothermophilus''), which is extremely resistant to steam sterilization. Biological indicators may take the form of glass vials of spores and liquid media, or as spores on strips of paper inside [[glassine]] envelopes. These indicators are placed in locations where it is difficult for steam to reach to verify that steam is penetrating there.\n\nFor autoclaving, cleaning is critical. Extraneous biological matter or grime may shield organisms from steam penetration. Proper cleaning can be achieved through physical scrubbing, [[sonication]], [[ultrasound]], or pulsed air.<ref>{{cite web|title=Decontamination and Sterilization|url=http://www.ors.od.nih.gov/sr/dohs/BioSafety/decon/Pages/decontamination.aspx|website=NIH}}</ref>\n\n[[Pressure cooking]] and [[canning]] is analogous to autoclaving, and when performed correctly renders food sterile.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Roth|first=S.|last2=Feichtinger|first2=J.|last3=Hertel|first3=C.|date=February 2010|title=Characterization of Bacillus subtilisspore inactivation in low-pressure, low-temperature gas plasma sterilization processes|journal=Journal of Applied Microbiology|volume=108|issue=2|pages=521\u2013531|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2672.2009.04453.x|pmid=19659696|issn=1364-5072}}</ref>{{Failed verification|date=February 2020|reason=No mention of canning in citation}}\n\nMoist heat causes the destruction of microorganisms by [[Denaturation (biochemistry)|denaturation]] of macromolecules, primarily proteins.

The destruction of microorganisms through the use of dry heat is a gradual phenomenon. With longer exposure to lethal temperatures, the number of killed microorganisms increases. Forced ventilation of hot air can be used to increase the rate at which heat is transferred to an organism and reduce the temperature and amount of time needed to achieve sterility. At higher temperatures, shorter exposure times are required to kill organisms. This can reduce heat-induced damage to food products.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Casolari|first1=A.|title=FOOD STERILIZATION BY HEAT|url=http://www.vency.com/sterilization.html|website=Liberty Knowledge Reason}}</ref>\nThe standard setting for a hot air oven is at least two hours at {{Cvt|160|C|}}.

Leaving the loop in the flame of a [[Bunsen burner]] or [[alcohol burner]] until it glows red ensures that any infectious agent is inactivated. This is commonly used for small metal or glass objects, but not for large objects (see [[Sterilisation (microbiology)#Incineration|Incineration]] below). However, during the initial heating, infectious material may be sprayed from the wire surface before it is killed, contaminating nearby surfaces and objects. Therefore, special heaters have been developed that surround the inoculating loop with a heated cage, ensuring that such sprayed material does not further contaminate the area. Another problem is that gas flames may leave carbon or other residues on the object if the object is not heated enough. A variation on flaming is to dip the object in a 70% or more concentrated solution of [[ethanol]], then briefly touch the object to a [[Bunsen burner]] flame. The ethanol will ignite and burn off rapidly, leaving less residue than a gas flame\n\n===Incineration===\n[[Incineration]] is a waste treatment process that involves the combustion of organic substances contained in waste materials. This method also burns any organism to ash. It is used to sterilize medical and other [[Biomedical waste|biohazardous waste]] before it is discarded with non-hazardous waste. Bacteria incinerators are mini furnaces that incinerate and kill off any microorganisms that may be on an inoculating loop or wire.<ref>[[Incineration]]</ref>\n\n===Tyndallization===\n{{Main|Tyndallization}}\nNamed after [[John Tyndall]], Tyndallization<ref>{{cite web\n |url         = http://www.umsl.edu/~microbes/pdf/tyndallization.pdf\n |title       = Sterilization of Broth Media by Tyndallization\n |year        = 1999\n |last        = Thiel\n |first       = Theresa\n |publisher   = Science in the Real World\n |accessdate  = 2007-03-06\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20060902202504/http://www.umsl.edu/~microbes/pdf/tyndallization.pdf\n |archivedate = 2006-09-02\n}}</ref> is an obsolete and lengthy process designed to reduce the level of activity of sporulating bacteria that are left by a simple boiling water method. The process involves boiling for a period (typically 20 minutes) at atmospheric pressure, cooling, incubating for a day, and then repeating the process a total of three to four times. The incubation periods are to allow heat-resistant spores surviving the previous boiling period to germinate to form the heat-sensitive vegetative (growing) stage, which can be killed by the next boiling step. This is effective because many spores are stimulated to grow by the heat shock. The procedure only works for media that can support bacterial growth, and will not sterilize non-nutritive substrates like water. Tyndallization is also ineffective against prions.\n\n===Glass bead sterilizers===\nGlass bead sterilizers work by heating glass beads to {{Cvt|250|C|}}. Instruments are then quickly doused in these glass beads, which heat the object while physically scraping contaminants off their surface. Glass bead sterilizers were once a common sterilization method employed in [[dentistry|dental]] offices as well as biological laboratories,<ref name=\"BS\">{{cite journal |author=Zadik Y, Peretz A |title=The effectiveness of glass bead sterilizer in the dental practice |journal=J Isr Dent Assoc |volume=25 |issue=2 |pages=36\u20139 |date=Apr 2008 |pmid=18780544}}</ref> but are not approved by the [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) and [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) to be used as a sterilizers since 1997.<ref>https://www.cdc.gov/OralHealth/InfectionControl/faq/bead.htm 2008-09-11</ref> They are still popular in [[Europe]]an and [[Israel]]i dental practices, although there are no current [[evidence-based medicine|evidence-based]] guidelines for using this sterilizer.<ref name=\"BS\"/>\n\n==Chemical sterilization==\n[[File:2003-12-03-Chemiclav.JPG|thumb|Chemiclav]]\n\nChemicals are also used for sterilization. Heating provides a reliable way to rid objects of all transmissible agents, but it is not always appropriate if it will damage heat-sensitive materials such as biological materials, [[fiber optic]]s, electronics, and many [[plastic]]s. In these situations chemicals, either in a gaseous or liquid form, can be used as sterilants. While the use of gas and liquid chemical sterilants avoids the problem of heat damage, users must ensure that the article to be sterilized is chemically compatible with the sterilant being used. In addition, the use of chemical sterilants poses new challenges for [[Workplace safety and health|workplace safety]], as the properties that make chemicals effective sterilants usually make them harmful to humans.\n\n===Ethylene oxide===\n[[Ethylene oxide]] (EO, EtO) gas treatment is one of the common methods used to sterilize, pasteurize, or disinfect items because of its wide range of material compatibility. It is also used to process items that are sensitive to processing with other methods, such as radiation (gamma, electron beam, X-ray), heat (moist or dry), or other chemicals. Ethylene oxide treatment is the most common chemical sterilization method, used for approximately 70% of total sterilizations, and for over 50% of all [[disposable]] medical devices.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kanemitsu|first=Keiji|last2=Imasaka|first2=Takayuki|last3=Ishikawa|first3=Shiho|last4=Kunishima|first4=Hiroyuki|last5=Harigae|first5=Hideo|last6=Ueno|first6=Kumi|last7=Takemura|first7=Hiromu|last8=Hirayama|first8=Yoshihiro|last9=Kaku|first9=Mitsuo|date=May 2005|title=A Comparative Study of Ethylene Oxide Gas, Hydrogen Peroxide Gas Plasma, and Low-Temperature Steam Formaldehyde Sterilization|journal=Infection Control & Hospital Epidemiology|volume=26|issue=5|pages=486\u2013489|doi=10.1086/502572|pmid=15954488|issn=0899-823X}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.osha.gov/OshDoc/data_General_Facts/ethylene-oxide-factsheet.pdf|title=Ethylene oxide|last=|first=|date=|website=Occupational Safety and Health Administration|publisher=OSHA|access-date=2016-05-17}}</ref>\n\nEthylene oxide treatment is generally carried out between {{Cvt|30 and 60|C|}} with [[relative humidity]] above 30% and a gas concentration between 200 and 800&nbsp;mg/l.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://naspco.com/sterilization/|title=Sterilization {{!}} NASP|website=North American Sterilization & Packaging|access-date=2016-05-17}}</ref> Typically, the process lasts for several hours. Ethylene oxide is highly effective, as it penetrates all [[porous materials]], and it can penetrate through some plastic materials and films. Ethylene oxide kills all known microorganisms, such as bacteria (including spores), viruses, and fungi (including yeasts and moulds), and is compatible with almost all materials even when repeatedly applied. It is flammable, toxic, and [[carcinogen]]ic; however, only with a reported potential for some adverse health effects when not used in compliance with published requirements. Ethylene oxide sterilizers and processes require biological [[validation (drug manufacturer)|validation]] after sterilizer installation, significant repairs or process changes.\n\nThe traditional process consists of a preconditioning phase (in a separate room or cell), a processing phase (more commonly in a vacuum vessel and sometimes in a pressure rated vessel), and an aeration phase (in a separate room or cell) to remove EO residues and lower by-products such as [[ethylene chlorohydrin]] (EC or ECH) and, of lesser importance, [[ethylene glycol]] (EG). An alternative process, known as all-in-one processing, also exists for some products whereby all three phases are performed in the vacuum or pressure rated vessel. This latter option can facilitate faster overall processing time and residue dissipation.\n\nThe most common EO processing method is the gas chamber method. To benefit from [[economies of scale]], EO has traditionally been delivered by filling a large chamber with a combination of gaseous EO either as pure EO, or with other gases used as diluents; diluents include chlorofluorocarbons ([[CFCs]]), hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs), and [[carbon dioxide]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Mushtaq|first=Maryam|last2=Banks|first2=Charles J.|last3=Heaven|first3=Sonia|date=May 2012|title=Effectiveness of pressurised carbon dioxide for inactivation of Escherichia coli isolated from sewage sludge|journal=Water Science and Technology|volume=65|issue=10|pages=1759\u20131764|doi=10.2166/wst.2012.064|pmid=22546789|issn=0273-1223}}</ref>\n\nEthylene oxide is still widely used by medical device manufacturers.<ref>Mendes GCC, Brand\u00e3o TRS, Silva CLM. 2007.

The unique physical properties of NO<sub>2</sub> gas allow for sterilant dispersion in an enclosed environment at room temperature and atmospheric pressure. The mechanism for lethality is the degradation of [[DNA]] in the spore core through [[nitration]] of the phosphate backbone, which kills the exposed organism as it absorbs NO<sub>2</sub>. This degradation occurs at even very low concentrations of the gas.<ref>G\u00f6rsdorf S, Appel KE, Engeholm C, Obe G.; Nitrogen dioxide induces DNA single-strand breaks in cultured Chinese hamster cells: Carcinogenesis. 1990.</ref> NO<sub>2</sub> has a boiling point of {{Cvt|21|C|}} at sea level, which results in a relatively highly saturated [[Vapor pressure|vapour pressure]] at ambient temperature. Because of this, liquid NO<sub>2</sub> may be used as a convenient source for the sterilant gas. Liquid NO<sub>2</sub> is often referred to by the name of its [[Dimer (chemistry)|dimer]], [[dinitrogen tetroxide]] (N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>). Additionally, the low levels of concentration required, coupled with the high vapour pressure, assures that no [[condensation]] occurs on the devices being sterilized. This means that no aeration of the devices is required immediately following the sterilization cycle.<ref name=\"Mechanism Overview, June 2012\">{{cite web|title=Mechanism Overview, June 2012|url=http://noxilizer.com/pdf/news/WhitePaper-Mechanism_Overview_6_14_12.pdf|work=noxilizer.com|publisher=Noxilizer, Inc.|accessdate=2 July 2013}}</ref> NO<sub>2</sub> is also less [[Corrosive substance|corrosive]] than other sterilant gases, and is compatible with most medical materials and adhesives.<ref name=\"Mechanism Overview, June 2012\"/>\n\nThe most-resistant organism (MRO) to sterilization with NO<sub>2</sub> gas is the spore of ''[[Geobacillus stearothermophilus]]'', which is the same MRO for both steam and hydrogen peroxide sterilization processes. The spore form of ''G. stearothermophilus'' has been well characterized over the years as a [[biological indicator]] in sterilization applications. Microbial inactivation of ''G. stearothermophilus'' with NO<sub>2</sub> gas proceeds rapidly in a [[Log-linear graph|log-linear]] fashion, as is typical of other sterilization processes. Noxilizer, Inc. has commercialized this technology to offer contract sterilization services for [[medical devices]] at its Baltimore, Maryland (U.S.) facility.<ref>{{cite web|title=Noxilizer Contract Sterilization Services|url=http://noxilizer.com/services.php|work=noxilizer.com|publisher=Noxilizer, Inc.|accessdate=2 July 2013}}</ref> This has been demonstrated in Noxilizer\u2019s lab in multiple studies and is supported by published reports from other labs. These same properties also allow for quicker removal of the sterilant and residual gases through aeration of the enclosed environment. The combination of rapid lethality and easy removal of the gas allows for shorter overall cycle times during the sterilization (or decontamination) process and a lower level of sterilant residuals than are found with other sterilization methods.<ref name=\"Mechanism Overview, June 2012\"/>\n\n===Ozone===\n[[Ozone]] is used in industrial settings to sterilize water and air, as well as a disinfectant for surfaces. It has the benefit of being able to [[oxidize]] most organic matter. On the other hand, it is a toxic and unstable gas that must be produced on-site, so it is not practical to use in many settings.\n\nOzone offers many advantages as a sterilant gas; ozone is a very efficient sterilant because of its strong oxidizing properties ([[Oxidation number|E]]=2.076 vs [[Standard hydrogen electrode|SHE]]<ref>{{cite book|title= CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 76th Ed|last= |first= |publisher= |year= 1995|isbn= |location= |pages=}}</ref>) capable of destroying a wide range of pathogens, including prions, without the need for handling hazardous chemicals since the ozone is generated within the sterilizer from medical-grade [[oxygen]]. The high reactivity of ozone means that waste ozone can be destroyed by passing over a simple catalyst that reverts it to oxygen and ensures that the cycle time is relatively short. The disadvantage of using ozone is that the gas is very reactive and very hazardous. The NIOSH's immediately dangerous to life and health limit (IDLH) for ozone is {{nowrap|5 ppm,}} {{nowrap|160 times}} smaller than the {{nowrap|800 ppm}} IDLH for ethylene oxide.

The sterilant gas manufacturers include many safety features in their products but prudent practice is to provide continuous monitoring of exposure to ozone, in order to provide a rapid warning in the event of a leak. Monitors for determining workplace exposure to ozone are commercially available.\n\n===Glutaraldehyde and formaldehyde===\n\n{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2017}}\n\n[[Glutaraldehyde]] and [[formaldehyde]] solutions (also used as [[fixation (histology)|fixatives]]) are accepted liquid sterilizing agents, provided that the immersion time is sufficiently long. To kill all spores in a clear liquid can take up to 22 hours with glutaraldehyde and even longer with formaldehyde. The presence of solid particles may lengthen the required period or render the treatment ineffective. Sterilization of blocks of tissue can take much longer, due to the time required for the fixative to penetrate. Glutaraldehyde and formaldehyde are [[Volatile organic compound|volatile]], and toxic by both skin contact and inhalation. Glutaraldehyde has a short shelf-life (<2 weeks), and is expensive. Formaldehyde is less expensive and has a much longer shelf-life if some [[methanol]] is added to inhibit [[polymerization]] to [[paraformaldehyde]], but is much more volatile. Formaldehyde is also used as a gaseous sterilizing agent; in this case, it is prepared on-site by depolymerization of solid paraformaldehyde. Many vaccines, such as the original [[Salk Polio Vaccine|Salk polio vaccine]], are sterilized with formaldehyde.\n\n===Hydrogen peroxide===\n[[Hydrogen peroxide]], in both liquid and as [[vaporized hydrogen peroxide]] (VHP), is another chemical sterilizing agent. Hydrogen peroxide is a strong [[oxidant]], which allows it to destroy a wide range of pathogens. Hydrogen peroxide is used to sterilize heat- or temperature-sensitive articles, such as rigid [[endoscope]]s. In medical sterilization, hydrogen peroxide is used at higher concentrations, ranging from around 35% up to 90%. The biggest advantage of hydrogen peroxide as a sterilant is the short cycle time. Whereas the cycle time for ethylene oxide may be 10 to 15 hours, some modern hydrogen peroxide sterilizers have a cycle time as short as 28 minutes.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.aspjj.com/emea/products-and-services/low-temperature-sterilization/sterrad-nx|title= Sterrad NX|accessdate= 25 March 2015|website= |publisher= |last= |first=}}</ref>\n\nDrawbacks of hydrogen peroxide include material compatibility, a lower capability for penetration and operator health risks. Products containing cellulose, such as paper, cannot be sterilized using VHP and products containing [[nylon]] may become brittle.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.cdc.gov/hicpac/pdf/guidelines/Disinfection_Nov_2008.pdf|title= Guidelines for Disinfection|date= 2008|accessdate= |website= |publisher= [[Center for Disease Control]]|last= |first=}}</ref> The penetrating ability of hydrogen peroxide is not as good as ethylene oxide{{citation needed|date= January 2013}} and so there are limitations on the length and diameter of the lumen of objects that can be effectively sterilized. Hydrogen peroxide is a primary irritant and the contact of the liquid solution with skin will cause [[Skin whitening|bleaching]] or [[ulceration]] depending on the concentration and contact time. It is relatively non-toxic when diluted to low concentrations, but is a dangerous oxidizer at high concentrations (> 10% w/w). The vapour is also hazardous, primarily affecting the eyes and respiratory system. Even short term exposures can be hazardous and NIOSH has set the IDLH at 75 ppm,<ref name=\"cdc.gov\"/> less than one tenth the IDLH for ethylene oxide (800 ppm). Prolonged exposure to lower concentrations can cause permanent lung damage and consequently, OSHA has set the permissible exposure limit to 1.0 ppm, calculated as an eight-hour time-weighted average.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p_table=standards&p_id=9992|title= 29 CFR 1910.1000 Table Z-1|accessdate= 25 March 2015|website= |publisher= [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]]|last= |first=}}</ref> Sterilizer manufacturers go to great lengths to make their products safe through careful design and incorporation of many safety features, though there are still workplace exposures of hydrogen peroxide from gas sterilizers documented in the FDA MAUDE database.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfMAUDE/search.CFM |title=MAUDE - Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience |publisher=Accessdata.fda.gov |accessdate=2010-06-25}}</ref> When using any type of gas sterilizer, prudent work practices should include good ventilation, a continuous gas monitor for hydrogen peroxide and good work practices and training.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.osha.gov/SLTC/healthguidelines/hydrogenperoxide/recognition.html |title=Occupational Safety and Health Guideline for Hydrogen Peroxide |publisher=Osha.gov |accessdate=2010-06-25}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/MHMI/mmg174.html |title=ATSDR - MMG: Hydrogen Peroxide |publisher=Atsdr.cdc.gov |date=2007-09-24 |accessdate=2010-06-25}}</ref>\n\n[[Vaporized hydrogen peroxide]] (VHP) is used to sterilize large enclosed and sealed areas, such as entire rooms and aircraft interiors.\n\nAlthough toxic, VHP breaks down in a short time to water and oxygen.\n\n===Peracetic acid===\n[[Peracetic acid]] (0.2%) is a recognized sterilant by the FDA<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/ReprocessingofReusableMedicalDevices/ucm437347.htm|title= Cleared Sterilants and High Level Disinfectants with General Claims for Processing Reusable Medical and Dental Devices|date= March 2015|accessdate= |website= |publisher= United States [[Food and Drug Administration]]|last= |first=}}</ref> for use in sterilizing medical devices such as [[endoscope]]s.\n\n===Potential for chemical sterilization of prions===\nPrions are highly resistant to chemical sterilization.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=McDonnell|first=Gerald|last2=Burke|first2=Peter|date=May 2003|title=The Challenge of Prion Decontamination|journal=Clinical Infectious Diseases|volume=36|issue=9|pages=1152\u20131154|doi=10.1086/374668|pmid=12715310|issn=1058-4838}}</ref> Treatment with [[aldehyde]]s, such as formaldehyde, have actually been shown to increase prion resistance.

Many objects that are transparent to [[visible light]] absorb UV. UV irradiation is routinely used to sterilize the interiors of [[biological safety cabinet]]s between uses, but is ineffective in shaded areas, including areas under dirt (which may become polymerized after prolonged irradiation, so that it is very difficult to remove).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Eischeid|first=Anne C.|last2=Linden|first2=Karl G.|date=2010-12-03|title=Molecular Indications of Protein Damage in Adenoviruses after UV Disinfection|journal=Applied and Environmental Microbiology|volume=77|issue=3|pages=1145\u20131147|doi=10.1128/aem.00403-10|pmid=21131511|pmc=3028702|issn=0099-2240}}</ref> It also damages some plastics, such as [[polystyrene]] foam if exposed for prolonged periods of time.\n\n===Ionizing radiation sterilization===\n[[File:E-beam-x-ray-gamma-efficiency.jpg|thumb|Efficiency illustration of the different radiation technologies (electron beam, X-ray, gamma rays)]]\n\nThe safety of irradiation facilities is regulated by the [[International Atomic Energy Agency|United Nations International Atomic Energy Agency]] and monitored by the different national [[Nuclear Regulatory Commission]]s (NRC). The radiation exposure accidents that have occurred in the past are documented by the agency and thoroughly analyzed to determine the cause and improvement potential. Such improvements are then mandated to retrofit existing facilities and future design.\n\n[[Gamma Radiation|Gamma radiation]] is very penetrating, and is commonly used for sterilization of disposable medical equipment, such as syringes, needles, [[cannula]]s and IV sets, and food. It is emitted by a [[radioisotope]], usually [[cobalt-60]] (<sup>60</sup>Co) or [[caesium-137]] (<sup>137</sup>Cs), which have [[photon]] energies of up to 1.3 and 0.66 [[MeV]], respectively.\n\nUse of a radioisotope requires shielding for the safety of the operators while in use and in storage. With most designs, the radioisotope is lowered into a water-filled source storage pool, which absorbs radiation and allows maintenance personnel to enter the radiation shield. One variant keeps the radioisotope under water at all times and lowers the product to be irradiated in the water in hermetically-sealed bells; no further shielding is required for such designs. Other uncommonly used designs use dry storage, providing movable shields that reduce radiation levels in areas of the irradiation chamber. An incident in [[Decatur, Georgia]], US, where water-soluble caesium-137 leaked into the source storage pool, requiring NRC intervention<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/gen-comm/info-notices/1989/in89082.html|title=NRC: Information Notice No. 89-82: Recent Safety-Related Incidents at Large Irradiators|website=www.nrc.gov}}</ref> has led to use of this radioisotope being almost entirely discontinued in favour of the more costly, non-water-soluble cobalt-60. Cobalt-60 gamma [[photon]]s have about twice the energy, and hence greater penetrating range, of caesium-137-produced radiation.\n\n[[Electron beam processing]] is also commonly used for sterilization. [[Electron beams]] use an on-off technology and provide a much higher dosing rate than gamma or X-rays. Due to the higher dose rate, less exposure time is needed and thereby any potential degradation to polymers is reduced. Because [[electron]]s carry a charge, electron beams are less penetrating than both gamma and X-rays. Facilities rely on substantial concrete shields to protect workers and the environment from radiation exposure.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://lss.fnal.gov/archive/2019/conf/fermilab-conf-19-574-di.pdf|title= 2019 Midwest Medical Device Sterilization Workshop: Summary Report\n|date= November 2019|accessdate= |website= |publisher= United States [[Department of Energy]]|last= |first=}}</ref>\n\n[[High-energy X-rays]] (produced by [[bremsstrahlung]]) allow irradiation of large packages and [[pallet]] loads of medical devices. They are sufficiently penetrating to treat multiple pallet loads of low-density packages with very good dose uniformity ratios. X-ray sterilization does not require chemical or radioactive material: high-energy X-rays are generated at high intensity by an [[X-ray generator]] that does not require shielding when not in use. X-rays are generated by bombarding a dense material (target) such as [[tantalum]] or [[tungsten]] with high-energy electrons, in a process known as bremsstrahlung conversion. These systems are energy-inefficient, requiring much more electrical energy than other systems for the same result.\n\n[[Irradiation]] with X-rays, gamma rays, or electrons does not make materials [[radioactive]], because the energy used is too low. Generally an energy of at least 10 MeV is needed to [[induced radioactivity|induce radioactivity]] in a material.<ref name=\"ThomadsenNath2014\">{{cite journal|last1=Thomadsen|first1=Bruce|last2=Nath|first2=Ravinder|last3=Bateman|first3=Fred B.|last4=Farr|first4=Jonathan|last5=Glisson|first5=Cal|last6=Islam|first6=Mohammad K.|last7=LaFrance|first7=Terry|last8=Moore|first8=Mary E.|last9=George Xu|first9=X.|last10=Yudelev|first10=Mark|title=Potential Hazard Due to Induced Radioactivity Secondary to Radiotherapy|journal=Health Physics|volume=107|issue=5|year=2014|pages=442\u2013460|issn=0017-9078|doi=10.1097/HP.0000000000000139|pmid=25271934}}</ref> [[Neutron]]s and very high-energy particles can make materials radioactive, but have good penetration, whereas lower energy particles (other than neutrons) cannot make materials radioactive, but have poorer penetration.\n\nSterilization by irradiation with gamma rays may however affect material properties.<ref>{{cite journal |last= Bharati |first= S |author2=Soundrapandian C |author3=Basu D |author4=Datta S |title= Studies on a novel bioactive glass and composite coating with hydroxyapatite on titanium based alloys: Effect of \u03b3-sterilization on coating |journal= [[J.

There are many techniques used to aid this process. One of these processes would be heat treatment. Heat treatment ceases bacterial and enzyme activity which then leads to decreasing the chances of low quality foods while maintaining the life of non-perishable foods. A specific type of heat treatment used would be UHT (Ultra-High Temperature) Sterilization. This type of heat treatment focuses on sterilization over 100 degrees Celsius. Two other types of sterilization are moist and dry heat sterilization. During moist heat sterilization, the temperatures that are used vary from 110 to 130 degrees Celsius. The minimum amount of time that sterilization would take place with moist heat would be 20 minutes and 40 minutes being the maximum. In other words, the higher the heat, the time for sterilization shortens. The use of dry heat sterilization uses longer times of susceptibility that may last up to 2 hours and that use much higher temperatures compared to moist heat sterilization. These temperatures may range from 160 to 180 degrees Celsius.\n\n===Medicine and surgery===\n[[File:Joseph Lister c1855.jpg|thumb|160px|[[Joseph Lister, 1st Baron Lister|Joseph Lister]] was a pioneer of [[antiseptic#Usage in surgery|antiseptic surgery]].]]\n[[File:Der Apparat zur Sterilisierung der Operationsinstrumente - CH-BAR - 3240236.tif|thumb|Apparatus to sterilize surgical instruments, Verwaltungsgeb\u00e4ude der Schweiz.

The degree of sterilization is commonly expressed by multiples of the decimal reduction time, or [[D-value (microbiology)|D-value]], denoting the time needed to reduce the initial number <math>N_0</math> to one tenth (<math>10^{-1}</math>) of its original value.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.fda.gov/RegulatoryInformation/Guidances/ucm071261.htm|title= Guidance for Industry: Biological Indicators|date= 4 October 2007|accessdate= |website= |publisher= United States [[Food and Drug Administration]]|last= |first=}}</ref> Then the number of microorganisms <math>N</math> after sterilization time <math>t</math> is given by:\n:<math>\\frac{N}{N_0}= 10^{\\left(-\\frac{t}{D}\\right)}</math>.\nThe D-value is a function of sterilization conditions and varies with the type of microorganism, [[temperature]], [[water activity]], [[pH]] etc.. For steam sterilization (see below) typically the temperature, in degrees [[Celsius]], is given as an index.\n\nTheoretically, the likelihood of the survival of an individual microorganism is never zero. To compensate for this, the overkill method is often used. Using the overkill method, sterilization is performed by sterilizing for longer than is required to kill the [[bioburden]] present on or in the item being sterilized. This provides a [[sterility assurance level]] (SAL) equal to the probability of a non-sterile unit.\n\nFor high-risk applications, such as medical devices and injections, a sterility assurance level of at least 10<sup>\u22126</sup> is required by the United States [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA).<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/UCM070342.pdf|title= Guidance for Industry: Sterile Drug Products Produced by Aseptic Processing|date= September 2004|accessdate= |website= |publisher= United States [[Food and Drug Administration]]|last= |first=}}</ref>\n\n==Heat==\n\n===Steam===\n{{See also|Moist heat sterilization}}\n\nA widely used method for heat sterilization is the [[autoclave]], sometimes called a converter or steam sterilizer. Autoclaves use steam heated to {{Cvt|121\u2013134|C|}} under [[pressure]]. To achieve sterility, the article is placed in a chamber and heated by injected steam until the article reaches a temperature and time setpoint. Almost all the air is removed from the chamber, because air is undesired in the moist heat sterilization process (this is one trait that differs from a typical pressure cooker used for food cooking). The article is held at the temperature setpoint for a period of time which varies depending on what [[bioburden]] is present on the article being sterilized and its resistance ([[D-value (microbiology)|D-value]]) to steam sterilization. A general cycle would be anywhere between 3 and 15 minutes, (depending on the generated heat)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lso-inc.com/sterilization-validation-services/iso17665-steam-sterilization.html|title=Steam Sterilization for Medical Devices - ISO 17665 - Sterilization Validation Services|website=www.lso-inc.com}}</ref> at {{Cvt|121|C|}} at {{Cvt|100|kPa|}}, which is sufficient to provide a sterility assurance level of 10<sup>\u22124</sup> for a product with a bioburden of 10<sup>6</sup> and a D-value of 2.0 minutes.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.sterislifesciences.com/sitecore/content/Sites/LifeSciences_com/Home/News-and-Events/News/2013/November/~/media/Files/LifeSciences_com/PDF/13ND-Dion.ashx|title= Steam Sterilization Principles|date= November 2013|accessdate= |website= |publisher= STERIS Life Sciences|last= |first=}}</ref> Following sterilization, liquids in a pressurized autoclave must be cooled slowly to avoid boiling over when the pressure is released. This may be achieved by gradually depressurizing the sterilization chamber and allowing liquids to evaporate under a negative pressure, while cooling the contents.\n\nProper autoclave treatment will inactivate all resistant bacterial [[spore]]s in addition to [[fungi]], bacteria, and viruses, but is not expected to eliminate all [[prion]]s, which vary in their resistance. For prion elimination, various recommendations state {{Cvt|121\u2013132|C|}} for 60 minutes or {{Cvt|134|C|}} for at least 18 minutes.{{citation needed|date= April 2016}} The 263K [[scrapie]] prion is inactivated relatively quickly by such sterilization procedures; however, other strains of scrapie, and strains of [[Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease]] (CKD) and [[bovine spongiform encephalopathy]] (BSE) are more resistant. Using [[laboratory mouse|mice]] as test animals, one experiment showed that heating BSE positive [[brain]] tissue at {{Cvt|134\u2013138|C|}} for 18 minutes resulted in only a 2.5 [[logarithm|log]] decrease in prion infectivity.<ref>http://web.tma.uz/gps/wp-content/uploads/sites/13/2015/09/ASEPSIS-ANTISEPTICS-INTRODUCTION.pdf</ref>\n\nMost autoclaves have meters and charts that record or display information, particularly temperature and pressure as a function of time. The information is checked to ensure that the conditions required for sterilization have been met. [[Autoclave tape|Indicator tape]] is often placed on the packages of products prior to autoclaving, and some packaging incorporates indicators. The indicator changes color when exposed to steam, providing a visual confirmation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/post/When_using_autoclave_we_use_autoclave_tape_which_changes_color_to_black_indicating_autoclaving_was_successful_what_is_the_molecular_mechanism|title=When using autoclave we use autoclave tape which changes color to black indicating autoclaving was successful, what is the molecular mechanism?|website=ResearchGate|access-date=2018-09-09}}</ref>\n\n[[Bioindicators]] can also be used to independently confirm autoclave performance. Simple bioindicator devices are commercially available, based on microbial spores. Most contain spores of the heat-resistant microbe ''[[Geobacillus stearothermophilus]]'' (formerly ''Bacillus stearothermophilus''), which is extremely resistant to steam sterilization. Biological indicators may take the form of glass vials of spores and liquid media, or as spores on strips of paper inside [[glassine]] envelopes. These indicators are placed in locations where it is difficult for steam to reach to verify that steam is penetrating there.\n\nFor autoclaving, cleaning is critical. Extraneous biological matter or grime may shield organisms from steam penetration. Proper cleaning can be achieved through physical scrubbing, [[sonication]], [[ultrasound]], or pulsed air.<ref>{{cite web|title=Decontamination and Sterilization|url=http://www.ors.od.nih.gov/sr/dohs/BioSafety/decon/Pages/decontamination.aspx|website=NIH}}</ref>\n\n[[Pressure cooking]] and [[canning]] is analogous to autoclaving, and when performed correctly renders food sterile.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Roth|first=S.|last2=Feichtinger|first2=J.|last3=Hertel|first3=C.|date=February 2010|title=Characterization of Bacillus subtilisspore inactivation in low-pressure, low-temperature gas plasma sterilization processes|journal=Journal of Applied Microbiology|volume=108|issue=2|pages=521\u2013531|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2672.2009.04453.x|pmid=19659696|issn=1364-5072}}</ref>{{Failed verification|date=February 2020|reason=No mention of canning in citation}}\n\nMoist heat causes the destruction of microorganisms by [[Denaturation (biochemistry)|denaturation]] of macromolecules, primarily proteins.

The destruction of microorganisms through the use of dry heat is a gradual phenomenon. With longer exposure to lethal temperatures, the number of killed microorganisms increases. Forced ventilation of hot air can be used to increase the rate at which heat is transferred to an organism and reduce the temperature and amount of time needed to achieve sterility. At higher temperatures, shorter exposure times are required to kill organisms. This can reduce heat-induced damage to food products.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Casolari|first1=A.|title=FOOD STERILIZATION BY HEAT|url=http://www.vency.com/sterilization.html|website=Liberty Knowledge Reason}}</ref>\nThe standard setting for a hot air oven is at least two hours at {{Cvt|160|C|}}.

Leaving the loop in the flame of a [[Bunsen burner]] or [[alcohol burner]] until it glows red ensures that any infectious agent is inactivated. This is commonly used for small metal or glass objects, but not for large objects (see [[Sterilisation (microbiology)#Incineration|Incineration]] below). However, during the initial heating, infectious material may be sprayed from the wire surface before it is killed, contaminating nearby surfaces and objects. Therefore, special heaters have been developed that surround the inoculating loop with a heated cage, ensuring that such sprayed material does not further contaminate the area. Another problem is that gas flames may leave carbon or other residues on the object if the object is not heated enough. A variation on flaming is to dip the object in a 70% or more concentrated solution of [[ethanol]], then briefly touch the object to a [[Bunsen burner]] flame. The ethanol will ignite and burn off rapidly, leaving less residue than a gas flame\n\n===Incineration===\n[[Incineration]] is a waste treatment process that involves the combustion of organic substances contained in waste materials. This method also burns any organism to ash. It is used to sterilize medical and other [[Biomedical waste|biohazardous waste]] before it is discarded with non-hazardous waste. Bacteria incinerators are mini furnaces that incinerate and kill off any microorganisms that may be on an inoculating loop or wire.<ref>[[Incineration]]</ref>\n\n===Tyndallization===\n{{Main|Tyndallization}}\nNamed after [[John Tyndall]], Tyndallization<ref>{{cite web\n |url         = http://www.umsl.edu/~microbes/pdf/tyndallization.pdf\n |title       = Sterilization of Broth Media by Tyndallization\n |year        = 1999\n |last        = Thiel\n |first       = Theresa\n |publisher   = Science in the Real World\n |accessdate  = 2007-03-06\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20060902202504/http://www.umsl.edu/~microbes/pdf/tyndallization.pdf\n |archivedate = 2006-09-02\n}}</ref> is an obsolete and lengthy process designed to reduce the level of activity of sporulating bacteria that are left by a simple boiling water method. The process involves boiling for a period (typically 20 minutes) at atmospheric pressure, cooling, incubating for a day, and then repeating the process a total of three to four times. The incubation periods are to allow heat-resistant spores surviving the previous boiling period to germinate to form the heat-sensitive vegetative (growing) stage, which can be killed by the next boiling step. This is effective because many spores are stimulated to grow by the heat shock. The procedure only works for media that can support bacterial growth, and will not sterilize non-nutritive substrates like water. Tyndallization is also ineffective against prions.\n\n===Glass bead sterilizers===\nGlass bead sterilizers work by heating glass beads to {{Cvt|250|C|}}. Instruments are then quickly doused in these glass beads, which heat the object while physically scraping contaminants off their surface. Glass bead sterilizers were once a common sterilization method employed in [[dentistry|dental]] offices as well as biological laboratories,<ref name=\"BS\">{{cite journal |author=Zadik Y, Peretz A |title=The effectiveness of glass bead sterilizer in the dental practice |journal=J Isr Dent Assoc |volume=25 |issue=2 |pages=36\u20139 |date=Apr 2008 |pmid=18780544}}</ref> but are not approved by the [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) and [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) to be used as a sterilizers since 1997.<ref>https://www.cdc.gov/OralHealth/InfectionControl/faq/bead.htm 2008-09-11</ref> They are still popular in [[Europe]]an and [[Israel]]i dental practices, although there are no current [[evidence-based medicine|evidence-based]] guidelines for using this sterilizer.<ref name=\"BS\"/>\n\n==Chemical sterilization==\n[[File:2003-12-03-Chemiclav.JPG|thumb|Chemiclav]]\n\nChemicals are also used for sterilization. Heating provides a reliable way to rid objects of all transmissible agents, but it is not always appropriate if it will damage heat-sensitive materials such as biological materials, [[fiber optic]]s, electronics, and many [[plastic]]s. In these situations chemicals, either in a gaseous or liquid form, can be used as sterilants. While the use of gas and liquid chemical sterilants avoids the problem of heat damage, users must ensure that the article to be sterilized is chemically compatible with the sterilant being used. In addition, the use of chemical sterilants poses new challenges for [[Workplace safety and health|workplace safety]], as the properties that make chemicals effective sterilants usually make them harmful to humans.\n\n===Ethylene oxide===\n[[Ethylene oxide]] (EO, EtO) gas treatment is one of the common methods used to sterilize, pasteurize, or disinfect items because of its wide range of material compatibility. It is also used to process items that are sensitive to processing with other methods, such as radiation (gamma, electron beam, X-ray), heat (moist or dry), or other chemicals. Ethylene oxide treatment is the most common chemical sterilization method, used for approximately 70% of total sterilizations, and for over 50% of all [[disposable]] medical devices.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kanemitsu|first=Keiji|last2=Imasaka|first2=Takayuki|last3=Ishikawa|first3=Shiho|last4=Kunishima|first4=Hiroyuki|last5=Harigae|first5=Hideo|last6=Ueno|first6=Kumi|last7=Takemura|first7=Hiromu|last8=Hirayama|first8=Yoshihiro|last9=Kaku|first9=Mitsuo|date=May 2005|title=A Comparative Study of Ethylene Oxide Gas, Hydrogen Peroxide Gas Plasma, and Low-Temperature Steam Formaldehyde Sterilization|journal=Infection Control & Hospital Epidemiology|volume=26|issue=5|pages=486\u2013489|doi=10.1086/502572|pmid=15954488|issn=0899-823X}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.osha.gov/OshDoc/data_General_Facts/ethylene-oxide-factsheet.pdf|title=Ethylene oxide|last=|first=|date=|website=Occupational Safety and Health Administration|publisher=OSHA|access-date=2016-05-17}}</ref>\n\nEthylene oxide treatment is generally carried out between {{Cvt|30 and 60|C|}} with [[relative humidity]] above 30% and a gas concentration between 200 and 800&nbsp;mg/l.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://naspco.com/sterilization/|title=Sterilization {{!}} NASP|website=North American Sterilization & Packaging|access-date=2016-05-17}}</ref> Typically, the process lasts for several hours. Ethylene oxide is highly effective, as it penetrates all [[porous materials]], and it can penetrate through some plastic materials and films. Ethylene oxide kills all known microorganisms, such as bacteria (including spores), viruses, and fungi (including yeasts and moulds), and is compatible with almost all materials even when repeatedly applied. It is flammable, toxic, and [[carcinogen]]ic; however, only with a reported potential for some adverse health effects when not used in compliance with published requirements. Ethylene oxide sterilizers and processes require biological [[validation (drug manufacturer)|validation]] after sterilizer installation, significant repairs or process changes.\n\nThe traditional process consists of a preconditioning phase (in a separate room or cell), a processing phase (more commonly in a vacuum vessel and sometimes in a pressure rated vessel), and an aeration phase (in a separate room or cell) to remove EO residues and lower by-products such as [[ethylene chlorohydrin]] (EC or ECH) and, of lesser importance, [[ethylene glycol]] (EG). An alternative process, known as all-in-one processing, also exists for some products whereby all three phases are performed in the vacuum or pressure rated vessel. This latter option can facilitate faster overall processing time and residue dissipation.\n\nThe most common EO processing method is the gas chamber method. To benefit from [[economies of scale]], EO has traditionally been delivered by filling a large chamber with a combination of gaseous EO either as pure EO, or with other gases used as diluents; diluents include chlorofluorocarbons ([[CFCs]]), hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs), and [[carbon dioxide]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Mushtaq|first=Maryam|last2=Banks|first2=Charles J.|last3=Heaven|first3=Sonia|date=May 2012|title=Effectiveness of pressurised carbon dioxide for inactivation of Escherichia coli isolated from sewage sludge|journal=Water Science and Technology|volume=65|issue=10|pages=1759\u20131764|doi=10.2166/wst.2012.064|pmid=22546789|issn=0273-1223}}</ref>\n\nEthylene oxide is still widely used by medical device manufacturers.<ref>Mendes GCC, Brand\u00e3o TRS, Silva CLM. 2007.

In hospitals, most EO sterilizers use single-use cartridges because of the convenience and ease of use compared to the former plumbed gas cylinders of EO blends.\n\nIt is important to adhere to patient and healthcare personnel government specified limits of EO residues in and/or on processed products, operator exposure after processing, during storage and handling of EO gas cylinders, and environmental emissions produced when using EO.\n\nThe U.S. [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] (OSHA) has set the [[permissible exposure limit]] (PEL) at 1 ppm \u2013 calculated as an eight-hour time-weighted average (TWA) \u2013 and 5 ppm as a 15-minute excursion limit (EL).

The unique physical properties of NO<sub>2</sub> gas allow for sterilant dispersion in an enclosed environment at room temperature and atmospheric pressure. The mechanism for lethality is the degradation of [[DNA]] in the spore core through [[nitration]] of the phosphate backbone, which kills the exposed organism as it absorbs NO<sub>2</sub>. This degradation occurs at even very low concentrations of the gas.<ref>G\u00f6rsdorf S, Appel KE, Engeholm C, Obe G.; Nitrogen dioxide induces DNA single-strand breaks in cultured Chinese hamster cells: Carcinogenesis. 1990.</ref> NO<sub>2</sub> has a boiling point of {{Cvt|21|C|}} at sea level, which results in a relatively highly saturated [[Vapor pressure|vapour pressure]] at ambient temperature. Because of this, liquid NO<sub>2</sub> may be used as a convenient source for the sterilant gas. Liquid NO<sub>2</sub> is often referred to by the name of its [[Dimer (chemistry)|dimer]], [[dinitrogen tetroxide]] (N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>). Additionally, the low levels of concentration required, coupled with the high vapour pressure, assures that no [[condensation]] occurs on the devices being sterilized. This means that no aeration of the devices is required immediately following the sterilization cycle.<ref name=\"Mechanism Overview, June 2012\">{{cite web|title=Mechanism Overview, June 2012|url=http://noxilizer.com/pdf/news/WhitePaper-Mechanism_Overview_6_14_12.pdf|work=noxilizer.com|publisher=Noxilizer, Inc.|accessdate=2 July 2013}}</ref> NO<sub>2</sub> is also less [[Corrosive substance|corrosive]] than other sterilant gases, and is compatible with most medical materials and adhesives.<ref name=\"Mechanism Overview, June 2012\"/>\n\nThe most-resistant organism (MRO) to sterilization with NO<sub>2</sub> gas is the spore of ''[[Geobacillus stearothermophilus]]'', which is the same MRO for both steam and hydrogen peroxide sterilization processes. The spore form of ''G. stearothermophilus'' has been well characterized over the years as a [[biological indicator]] in sterilization applications. Microbial inactivation of ''G. stearothermophilus'' with NO<sub>2</sub> gas proceeds rapidly in a [[Log-linear graph|log-linear]] fashion, as is typical of other sterilization processes. Noxilizer, Inc. has commercialized this technology to offer contract sterilization services for [[medical devices]] at its Baltimore, Maryland (U.S.) facility.<ref>{{cite web|title=Noxilizer Contract Sterilization Services|url=http://noxilizer.com/services.php|work=noxilizer.com|publisher=Noxilizer, Inc.|accessdate=2 July 2013}}</ref> This has been demonstrated in Noxilizer\u2019s lab in multiple studies and is supported by published reports from other labs. These same properties also allow for quicker removal of the sterilant and residual gases through aeration of the enclosed environment. The combination of rapid lethality and easy removal of the gas allows for shorter overall cycle times during the sterilization (or decontamination) process and a lower level of sterilant residuals than are found with other sterilization methods.<ref name=\"Mechanism Overview, June 2012\"/>\n\n===Ozone===\n[[Ozone]] is used in industrial settings to sterilize water and air, as well as a disinfectant for surfaces. It has the benefit of being able to [[oxidize]] most organic matter. On the other hand, it is a toxic and unstable gas that must be produced on-site, so it is not practical to use in many settings.\n\nOzone offers many advantages as a sterilant gas; ozone is a very efficient sterilant because of its strong oxidizing properties ([[Oxidation number|E]]=2.076 vs [[Standard hydrogen electrode|SHE]]<ref>{{cite book|title= CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 76th Ed|last= |first= |publisher= |year= 1995|isbn= |location= |pages=}}</ref>) capable of destroying a wide range of pathogens, including prions, without the need for handling hazardous chemicals since the ozone is generated within the sterilizer from medical-grade [[oxygen]]. The high reactivity of ozone means that waste ozone can be destroyed by passing over a simple catalyst that reverts it to oxygen and ensures that the cycle time is relatively short. The disadvantage of using ozone is that the gas is very reactive and very hazardous. The NIOSH's immediately dangerous to life and health limit (IDLH) for ozone is {{nowrap|5 ppm,}} {{nowrap|160 times}} smaller than the {{nowrap|800 ppm}} IDLH for ethylene oxide. NIOSH<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/idlh/intridl4.html|title=CDC - Index of Chemicals - NIOSH Publications and Products|website=www.cdc.gov|date=2019-10-08}}</ref> and OSHA has set the PEL for ozone at {{nowrap|0.1 ppm}}, calculated as an {{nowrap|eight-hour}} time-weighted average. The sterilant gas manufacturers include many safety features in their products but prudent practice is to provide continuous monitoring of exposure to ozone, in order to provide a rapid warning in the event of a leak. Monitors for determining workplace exposure to ozone are commercially available.\n\n===Glutaraldehyde and formaldehyde===\n\n{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2017}}\n\n[[Glutaraldehyde]] and [[formaldehyde]] solutions (also used as [[fixation (histology)|fixatives]]) are accepted liquid sterilizing agents, provided that the immersion time is sufficiently long. To kill all spores in a clear liquid can take up to 22 hours with glutaraldehyde and even longer with formaldehyde. The presence of solid particles may lengthen the required period or render the treatment ineffective. Sterilization of blocks of tissue can take much longer, due to the time required for the fixative to penetrate. Glutaraldehyde and formaldehyde are [[Volatile organic compound|volatile]], and toxic by both skin contact and inhalation. Glutaraldehyde has a short shelf-life (<2 weeks), and is expensive. Formaldehyde is less expensive and has a much longer shelf-life if some [[methanol]] is added to inhibit [[polymerization]] to [[paraformaldehyde]], but is much more volatile. Formaldehyde is also used as a gaseous sterilizing agent; in this case, it is prepared on-site by depolymerization of solid paraformaldehyde. Many vaccines, such as the original [[Salk Polio Vaccine|Salk polio vaccine]], are sterilized with formaldehyde.\n\n===Hydrogen peroxide===\n[[Hydrogen peroxide]], in both liquid and as [[vaporized hydrogen peroxide]] (VHP), is another chemical sterilizing agent. Hydrogen peroxide is a strong [[oxidant]], which allows it to destroy a wide range of pathogens. Hydrogen peroxide is used to sterilize heat- or temperature-sensitive articles, such as rigid [[endoscope]]s. In medical sterilization, hydrogen peroxide is used at higher concentrations, ranging from around 35% up to 90%. The biggest advantage of hydrogen peroxide as a sterilant is the short cycle time. Whereas the cycle time for ethylene oxide may be 10 to 15 hours, some modern hydrogen peroxide sterilizers have a cycle time as short as 28 minutes.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.aspjj.com/emea/products-and-services/low-temperature-sterilization/sterrad-nx|title= Sterrad NX|accessdate= 25 March 2015|website= |publisher= |last= |first=}}</ref>\n\nDrawbacks of hydrogen peroxide include material compatibility, a lower capability for penetration and operator health risks. Products containing cellulose, such as paper, cannot be sterilized using VHP and products containing [[nylon]] may become brittle.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.cdc.gov/hicpac/pdf/guidelines/Disinfection_Nov_2008.pdf|title= Guidelines for Disinfection|date= 2008|accessdate= |website= |publisher= [[Center for Disease Control]]|last= |first=}}</ref> The penetrating ability of hydrogen peroxide is not as good as ethylene oxide{{citation needed|date= January 2013}} and so there are limitations on the length and diameter of the lumen of objects that can be effectively sterilized. Hydrogen peroxide is a primary irritant and the contact of the liquid solution with skin will cause [[Skin whitening|bleaching]] or [[ulceration]] depending on the concentration and contact time. It is relatively non-toxic when diluted to low concentrations, but is a dangerous oxidizer at high concentrations (> 10% w/w).

Many objects that are transparent to [[visible light]] absorb UV. UV irradiation is routinely used to sterilize the interiors of [[biological safety cabinet]]s between uses, but is ineffective in shaded areas, including areas under dirt (which may become polymerized after prolonged irradiation, so that it is very difficult to remove).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Eischeid|first=Anne C.|last2=Linden|first2=Karl G.|date=2010-12-03|title=Molecular Indications of Protein Damage in Adenoviruses after UV Disinfection|journal=Applied and Environmental Microbiology|volume=77|issue=3|pages=1145\u20131147|doi=10.1128/aem.00403-10|pmid=21131511|pmc=3028702|issn=0099-2240}}</ref> It also damages some plastics, such as [[polystyrene]] foam if exposed for prolonged periods of time.\n\n===Ionizing radiation sterilization===\n[[File:E-beam-x-ray-gamma-efficiency.jpg|thumb|Efficiency illustration of the different radiation technologies (electron beam, X-ray, gamma rays)]]\n\nThe safety of irradiation facilities is regulated by the [[International Atomic Energy Agency|United Nations International Atomic Energy Agency]] and monitored by the different national [[Nuclear Regulatory Commission]]s (NRC). The radiation exposure accidents that have occurred in the past are documented by the agency and thoroughly analyzed to determine the cause and improvement potential. Such improvements are then mandated to retrofit existing facilities and future design.\n\n[[Gamma Radiation|Gamma radiation]] is very penetrating, and is commonly used for sterilization of disposable medical equipment, such as syringes, needles, [[cannula]]s and IV sets, and food. It is emitted by a [[radioisotope]], usually [[cobalt-60]] (<sup>60</sup>Co) or [[caesium-137]] (<sup>137</sup>Cs), which have [[photon]] energies of up to 1.3 and 0.66 [[MeV]], respectively.\n\nUse of a radioisotope requires shielding for the safety of the operators while in use and in storage. With most designs, the radioisotope is lowered into a water-filled source storage pool, which absorbs radiation and allows maintenance personnel to enter the radiation shield. One variant keeps the radioisotope under water at all times and lowers the product to be irradiated in the water in hermetically-sealed bells; no further shielding is required for such designs. Other uncommonly used designs use dry storage, providing movable shields that reduce radiation levels in areas of the irradiation chamber. An incident in [[Decatur, Georgia]], US, where water-soluble caesium-137 leaked into the source storage pool, requiring NRC intervention<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/gen-comm/info-notices/1989/in89082.html|title=NRC: Information Notice No. 89-82: Recent Safety-Related Incidents at Large Irradiators|website=www.nrc.gov}}</ref> has led to use of this radioisotope being almost entirely discontinued in favour of the more costly, non-water-soluble cobalt-60. Cobalt-60 gamma [[photon]]s have about twice the energy, and hence greater penetrating range, of caesium-137-produced radiation.\n\n[[Electron beam processing]] is also commonly used for sterilization. [[Electron beams]] use an on-off technology and provide a much higher dosing rate than gamma or X-rays. Due to the higher dose rate, less exposure time is needed and thereby any potential degradation to polymers is reduced. Because [[electron]]s carry a charge, electron beams are less penetrating than both gamma and X-rays. Facilities rely on substantial concrete shields to protect workers and the environment from radiation exposure.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://lss.fnal.gov/archive/2019/conf/fermilab-conf-19-574-di.pdf|title= 2019 Midwest Medical Device Sterilization Workshop: Summary Report\n|date= November 2019|accessdate= |website= |publisher= United States [[Department of Energy]]|last= |first=}}</ref>\n\n[[High-energy X-rays]] (produced by [[bremsstrahlung]]) allow irradiation of large packages and [[pallet]] loads of medical devices. They are sufficiently penetrating to treat multiple pallet loads of low-density packages with very good dose uniformity ratios. X-ray sterilization does not require chemical or radioactive material: high-energy X-rays are generated at high intensity by an [[X-ray generator]] that does not require shielding when not in use. X-rays are generated by bombarding a dense material (target) such as [[tantalum]] or [[tungsten]] with high-energy electrons, in a process known as bremsstrahlung conversion. These systems are energy-inefficient, requiring much more electrical energy than other systems for the same result.\n\n[[Irradiation]] with X-rays, gamma rays, or electrons does not make materials [[radioactive]], because the energy used is too low. Generally an energy of at least 10 MeV is needed to [[induced radioactivity|induce radioactivity]] in a material.<ref name=\"ThomadsenNath2014\">{{cite journal|last1=Thomadsen|first1=Bruce|last2=Nath|first2=Ravinder|last3=Bateman|first3=Fred B.|last4=Farr|first4=Jonathan|last5=Glisson|first5=Cal|last6=Islam|first6=Mohammad K.|last7=LaFrance|first7=Terry|last8=Moore|first8=Mary E.|last9=George Xu|first9=X.|last10=Yudelev|first10=Mark|title=Potential Hazard Due to Induced Radioactivity Secondary to Radiotherapy|journal=Health Physics|volume=107|issue=5|year=2014|pages=442\u2013460|issn=0017-9078|doi=10.1097/HP.0000000000000139|pmid=25271934}}</ref> [[Neutron]]s and very high-energy particles can make materials radioactive, but have good penetration, whereas lower energy particles (other than neutrons) cannot make materials radioactive, but have poorer penetration.\n\nSterilization by irradiation with gamma rays may however affect material properties.<ref>{{cite journal |last= Bharati |first= S |author2=Soundrapandian C |author3=Basu D |author4=Datta S |title= Studies on a novel bioactive glass and composite coating with hydroxyapatite on titanium based alloys: Effect of \u03b3-sterilization on coating |journal= [[J.

[[Cross-flow filtration|Tangential flow filtration]] (TFF) and alternating tangential flow (ATF) systems also reduce particulate accumulation and blockage.\n\nMembrane filters used in production processes are commonly made from materials such as mixed [[cellulose ester]] or [[polyethersulfone]] (PES). The filtration equipment and the filters themselves may be purchased as pre-sterilized disposable units in sealed packaging or must be sterilized by the user, generally by autoclaving at a temperature that does not damage the fragile filter membranes. To ensure proper functioning of the filter, the membrane filters are integrity tested post-use and sometimes before use.
