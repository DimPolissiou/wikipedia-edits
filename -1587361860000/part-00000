The constitutional rights of imprisoned persons were restricted under preventive detention laws passed by parliament. In the case of Shiva Kant Shukla (''Additional District Magistrate of Jabalpur v.

A few years after the emergency, however, the supreme court rejected the absoluteness of the 42nd amendment and reaffirmed its power of judicial review in ''[[Minerva Mills v.

It is said that the [[basic structure doctrine]], created in ''[[Kesavananda Bharati v. State of Kerala]]'', was strengthened in ''Indira Gandhi's'' case and set in stone in ''[[Minerva Mills v.

Civil and political rights (traditionally protected in the Fundamental Rights chapter of the Indian constitution) have also been expanded and more fiercely protected. These new interpretations have opened the avenue for litigation on a number of important issues.\n\n=== Recent important cases ===\nAmong the important pronouncements of the supreme court post 2000 is the Coelho case I.R. Coelho v. State of Tamil Nadu (Judgment of 11 January 2007). A unanimous bench of 9 judges reaffirmed the ''basic structure'' doctrine. It held that a constitutional amendment which entails violation of any fundamental rights which the court regards as forming part of the ''basic structure'' of the constitution, then the same can be struck down depending upon its impact and consequences. The judgment clearly imposes further limitations on the constituent power of parliament with respect to the principles underlying certain fundamental rights. The judgment in Coelho has in effect restored the decision in Golak Nath regarding non-amendability of the constitution on account of infraction of fundamental rights, contrary to the judgment in the [[Kesavananda Bharati v. State of Kerala|''Kesavananda Bharati'' case]].\n\nAnother important decision was of the five-judge bench in ''[[Ashoka Kumar Thakur v. Union of India]]''; where the constitutional validity of Central Educational Institutions (Reservations in Admissions) Act, 2006 was upheld, subject to the \"creamy layer\" criteria. Importantly, the court refused to follow the '[[strict scrutiny]]' standards of review followed by the United States supreme court.

Our society often ridicules and abuses the Transgender community and in public places like railway stations, bus stands, schools, workplaces, malls, theatres,\nhospitals, they are sidelined and treated as untouchables, forgetting the fact that the moral failure lies in the society's unwillingness to contain or embrace different gender identities and expressions, a mindset which we have to change.</blockquote>\n\nJustice Radhakrishnan said that transgender people should be treated consistently with other minorities under the law, enabling them to access jobs, healthcare and education.<ref>{{cite news|title=India court recognises transgender people as third gender|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-27031180|accessdate=15 April 2014|newspaper=BBC News|date=15 April 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140415130906/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-27031180|archive-date=15 April 2014|url-status=live}}</ref> He framed the issue as one of human rights, saying that, \"These TGs, even though insignificant in numbers, are still human beings and therefore they have every right to enjoy their human rights\", concluding by declaring that:<ref name=\"TGruling\" />\n\n(1) [[Hijra (South Asia)|Hijras]], eunuchs, apart from binary gender, be treated as \"third gender\" for the purpose of safeguarding their\nrights under Part III of our constitution and the laws made by the parliament and the State Legislature.\n\n(2) Transgender persons' right to decide their self-identified gender is also upheld and the Centre and State Governments are directed to grant legal recognition of their gender identity such as male, female or as third gender.\n\n==== Relief to over 35,000 public servants ====\nIn B.Prabhakara Rao vs. State of A.P. involved sudden reduction in age of superannuation from 58 years to 55 years of over 35,000 public servants of State Government, public sector undertakings, statutory bodies, educational institutions and Tirupathi-Tirumalai Devasthanams (TTD). They lost first round of litigation in the supreme court. Realising the mistake, fresh legislation was brought restoring the original age of superannuation of 58 years but providing that the benefit of new legislation would not extend to those whose reduction of age of superannuation had been upheld. In challenge to this law, Subodh Markandeya argued that all that was required was to strike down naughty \"not\" \u2013 which found favour with the supreme court bringing relief to over 35,000 public servants.\n\n==== Decriminalisation of homosexuality ====\n\nA five-member constitutional bench decriminalised homosexuality by partially striking down the [[Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code]] in September 2018. The bench led by [[Dipak Misra]] unanimously declared that criminalisation of private consensual sex between adult persons of the same sex under Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code was clearly unconstitutional.

Justice Khanna remains a legendary figure among the legal fraternity in India for this decision.\n\n''[[The New York Times]]'', wrote of this opinion: \"The submission of an independent judiciary to absolutist government is virtually the last step in the destruction of a democratic society; and the Indian supreme court's decision appears close to utter surrender.\"\n\nDuring the emergency period, the government also passed the [[Thirty-eighth Amendment of the Constitution of India|39th amendment]], which sought to limit judicial review for the election of the prime minister; only a body constituted by parliament could review this election.<ref>{{cite book\n| title =        India after Gandhi: The history of the world's largest democracy\n| author =       Ramachandra Guha\n| publisher =    Macmillan/Picador, 2007\n| page =         500\n}}</ref> Subsequently, the parliament, with most opposition members in jail during the emergency, passed the [[Forty-second Amendment of the Constitution of India|42nd Amendment]] which prevented any court from reviewing any amendment to the constitution with the exception of procedural issues concerning ratification. A few years after the emergency, however, the supreme court rejected the absoluteness of the 42nd amendment and reaffirmed its power of judicial review in ''[[Minerva Mills v. Union of India]]'' (1980).\n\n=== Post-1980: an assertive court ===\n{{See also|Judicial Activism In India}}\nAfter Indira Gandhi lost elections in 1977, the new government of [[Morarji Desai]], and especially [[Minister of Law and Justice|law minister]] [[Shanti Bhushan]] (who had earlier argued for the detenues in the ''Habeas Corpus case''), introduced a number of amendments making it more difficult to declare and sustain an emergency, and reinstated much of the power to the supreme court. It is said that the [[basic structure doctrine]], created in ''[[Kesavananda Bharati v. State of Kerala]]'', was strengthened in ''Indira Gandhi's'' case and set in stone in ''[[Minerva Mills v. Union of India]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Personal-law-should-be-subject-to-fundamental-rights-Jaitley/articleshow/49965830.cms|title=Personal law should be subject to fundamental rights: Jaitley|access-date=25 December 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160106074107/http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Personal-law-should-be-subject-to-fundamental-rights-Jaitley/articleshow/49965830.cms|archive-date=6 January 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe supreme court's creative and expansive interpretations of Article 21 (Life and Personal Liberty), primarily after the Emergency period, have given rise to a new jurisprudence of [[public interest litigation]] that has vigorously promoted many important economic and social rights (constitutionally protected but not enforceable) including, but not restricted to, the rights to free education, livelihood, a clean environment,<ref>{{cite book|last1=Shelton|first1=Dinah|last2=Kiss|first2=Alexandre|title=Judicial handbook on Environmental Law|date=2005|publisher=United Nations Environment Programme|isbn=92-807-2555-6|page=8|url=http://www.unep.org/delc/Portals/119/publications/Judicial-Handbook-Environmenal-Law.pdf#page=32|accessdate=1 December 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150511022001/http://www.unep.org/delc/Portals/119/publications/Judicial-Handbook-Environmenal-Law.pdf#page=32|archive-date=11 May 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> food and many others. Civil and political rights (traditionally protected in the Fundamental Rights chapter of the Indian constitution) have also been expanded and more fiercely protected. These new interpretations have opened the avenue for litigation on a number of important issues.\n\n=== Recent important cases ===\nAmong the important pronouncements of the supreme court post 2000 is the Coelho case I.R. Coelho v. State of Tamil Nadu (Judgment of 11 January 2007). A unanimous bench of 9 judges reaffirmed the ''basic structure'' doctrine. It held that a constitutional amendment which entails violation of any fundamental rights which the court regards as forming part of the ''basic structure'' of the constitution, then the same can be struck down depending upon its impact and consequences. The judgment clearly imposes further limitations on the constituent power of parliament with respect to the principles underlying certain fundamental rights. The judgment in Coelho has in effect restored the decision in Golak Nath regarding non-amendability of the constitution on account of infraction of fundamental rights, contrary to the judgment in the [[Kesavananda Bharati v. State of Kerala|''Kesavananda Bharati'' case]].\n\nAnother important decision was of the five-judge bench in ''[[Ashoka Kumar Thakur v. Union of India]]''; where the constitutional validity of Central Educational Institutions (Reservations in Admissions) Act, 2006 was upheld, subject to the \"creamy layer\" criteria. Importantly, the court refused to follow the '[[strict scrutiny]]' standards of review followed by the United States supreme court.
