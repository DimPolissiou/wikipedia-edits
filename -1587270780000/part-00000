It was released on November 12, 2004 by [[Aftermath Entertainment]], [[Shady Records]], and [[Interscope Records]]. Its release date was originally set for November 16, 2004, but Eminem moved the release date to four days earlier after the album was leaked to the internet. \n\nThe album contains several lyrical themes, most notably Eminem's opposition to then-[[President of the United States]] [[George W. Bush]] and a parody towards [[Michael Jackson]]. The album features more [[Comedy hip hop|comedic]] themes and lyrics than Eminem's previous albums.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/hip-hop/8071037/eminem-albums-ranked|title=All 8 of Eminem's Albums Ranked|date=2017-12-19|website=Billboard|access-date=2020-03-18}}</ref> ''Encore'' debuted at number one on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], selling 1.5 million copies in its second week. It also reached number one in ten other countries.\n\nCritical reception of ''Encore'' was less favorable than Eminem's previous albums, with most of the second half being heavily criticized for its lackluster quality and lack of lyrical content, though later on the album's middle section has been singled out for a lack of quality, and \"[[Mockingbird (Eminem song)|Mockingbird]]\" and \"[[Like Toy Soldiers]]\" were highly praised and retrospectively have been noted as being some of Eminem's best songs.  ''Encore'' has sold 11 million copies worldwide and was certified [[RIAA certification|quadruple platinum]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA) on December 17, 2004.\n\n''Encore'' provoked some controversy over anti-Bush lyrics and lyrics that parodied and targeted Jackson, who was upset about Eminem's depiction of him in the video for \"[[Just Lose It]]\".<ref name=\":1\" />  Retrospectively, the album is often considered to be one of Eminem's worst albums alongside ''[[Revival (Eminem album)|Revival]]'' (2017).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/3053829/eminem-describes-bad-albums/|title=Eminem Describes What Drove Him To Make His 'Bad' Albums|last=Holmes|first=Charles|website=MTV News|language=en|access-date=2019-11-17}}</ref> Eminem himself stated that not only did he rush some of the album because of a leak, but also that; \"''Encore''... [is] not what I would consider one of my better albums\" in an interview with [[Sway Calloway]] in 2018.\n\n==Content==\nThe album contains several lyrical themes, including Eminem's relationship with his ex-wife, Kim, (\"Puke\", and \"Love You More\"), their daughter Hailie Jade Mathers (\"[[Mockingbird (Eminem song)|Mockingbird]]\"), his childhood (\"Yellow Brick Road\"), his relationships with his parents (\"Evil Deeds\"), and opposition to then-American President [[George W. Bush]] (\"[[Mosh (song)|Mosh]]\" and \"We As Americans\")  \"[[Just Lose It]]\" is a parody of [[Michael Jackson]]'s \"[[Billie Jean]]\", as well as his [[Pepsi]] commercial accident in 1984. Similar to Eminem's previous album, ''[[The Eminem Show]]'', ''Encore'' opens with a skit called \"Curtains Up\", indicative of the start of the show, and closes with \"Curtains Down\", indicative of the end.\n\n==Censorship==\n{{refimprove section|date=May 2019}}\nSimultaneously with the original, a [[censorship|censored]] version was released, from which most of the profanities, violent and sexual content, as well the [[recreational drug|drug]] references had been edited out.\n\"My 1st Single\" has a bleep for the word \"fuck\" instead of a muted part on the hook: \"This was supposed to be my first single, but I just fucked that off so... Fuck it let's all have fun let's mingle\", the lines: \"Smack a bitch and slap a ho\" changed to \"Grab a chick and [[Do-si-do]]\". The second and third verses were edited with the words \"Kim\", \"Pornos\", \"Fucking\", and \"Cum\" on the second verse changed to the words; \"Frickin\", \"Videos\", \"Cussing\", and \"Puff\" (with an added explosion noise) respectively, and the third verse editing the word \"Cock\" with a chicken noise, and having \"Dick\" replaced with \"Duck\", along with the censored bleeps in replacement for the word \"Fuck\" as used on the hook. \"Puke\" has the word \"Fucking\" changed to \"Fricking\" throughout the song, \"Shit\" being replaced with \"Shoot\" near the end of the first verse, with the second verse being censored extensively with the line \"You're a fucking cokehead slut, I hope you fucking die\" changed to: \"You're a freaking piece of poop, I hope you freaking die\", and \"I hate your fucking guts, you fucking slut\" changed to \"I hate your freaking guts, you piece of poop\". On \"Just Lose It\", the first verse censors \"Molestation\" with \"Investigation\". In \"We as Americans\" the words dead was back masked in both clean and explicit versions of the song, due to an investigation for the lyrics; \"Fuck money, I don't rap for dead presidents, I'd rather see the president [dead]\". The word \"ass\" is left uncensored in \"Yellow Brick Road\", \"One Shot 2 Shot\", \"Encore\" and \"We As Americans\". However, it is censored out in \"[[Ass Like That]]\", \"[[Mosh (song) |Mosh]]\", \"Spend Some Time\", \"My 1st Single\", and \"[[Just Lose It]]\" (In this song's case, replaced with \"Thing\"), with the song \"Rain Man\", the word \"ass\" is used twice, but only censored once. The word \"goddamn\" was left uncensored in \"Spend Some Time\u201d while \"Yellow Brick Road\" leaves \"goddamn\" uncensored once. Other profanities on all other songs are blanked out; and the song \"Ass Like That\" is listed as \"A** Like That\". \"[[Encore (Eminem song)|Encore]]\" has the shooting sequence at the end of the track removed on the censored album. \"One Shot 2 Shot\" has the violent content edited removing the intro and the word \"shot\" throughout the song. However, the original title remains written on the back cover.\n\n==Artwork and packaging==\nThe album featured two covers, the first cover features Eminem standing in front of an audience, bowing to the crowd. The tray insert features Eminem holding a [[gun]] behind his back. The inlay shows Eminem holding the pistol in his mouth without the jacket of his shirt and tie. The CD itself shows a note written by Eminem saying \"To my family & all my friends, thank you for everything, I will always love you. To my fans, I'm Sorry, Marshall\" with a [[bullet]] underneath the note. The note is also seen in the album's booklet, where Eminem is writing the note. Some pictures show Eminem shooting everybody, which makes a reference to the ending of the album's [[Encore (Eminem song)|title track]]. The second cover features the same audience from the inlay on a black background with a [[blood]] splat on the top right. This cover is used for the Shady Collector's Edition.\n\n==Critical reception==\n{{Album ratings|\n| rev1 = [[AllMusic]]\n| rev1Score = {{Rating|3|5}}<ref name=\"AllMusic\">{{cite web|url={{Allmusic |pure_url=yes |class=album |id=r717546 |tab=review}} |title=Encore -

The song eventually appeared on the album's bonus disc, with the word \"dead\" being reversed.\n\nAbout the album's reception, Eminem said: \"I\u2019m cool with probably half that album. I recorded that towards the height of my addiction. I remember four songs leaked and I had to go to L.A. and get Dre and record new ones. I was in a room by myself writing songs in 25, 30 minutes because we had to get it done, and what came out was so goofy.

It was released on November 12, 2004 by [[Aftermath Entertainment]], [[Shady Records]], and [[Interscope Records]]. Its release date was originally set for November 16, 2004, but Eminem moved the release date to four days earlier after the album was leaked to the internet. \n\nThe album contains several lyrical themes, most notably Eminem's opposition to then-[[President of the United States]] [[George W. Bush]] and a parody towards [[Michael Jackson]]. The album features more [[Comedy hip hop|comedic]] themes and lyrics than Eminem's previous albums.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/hip-hop/8071037/eminem-albums-ranked|title=All 8 of Eminem's Albums Ranked|date=2017-12-19|website=Billboard|access-date=2020-03-18}}</ref> ''Encore'' debuted at number one on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], selling 1.5 million copies in its second week. It also reached number one in ten other countries.\n\nCritical reception of ''Encore'' was less favorable than Eminem's previous albums, with most of the second half being heavily criticized for its lackluster quality and lack of lyrical content, though later on the album's middle section has been singled out for a lack of quality, and \"[[Mockingbird (Eminem song)|Mockingbird]]\" and \"[[Like Toy Soldiers]]\" were highly praised and retrospectively have been noted as being some of Eminem's best songs.  ''Encore'' has sold 11 million copies worldwide and was certified [[RIAA certification|quadruple platinum]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA) on December 17, 2004.\n\n''Encore'' provoked some controversy over anti-Bush lyrics and lyrics that parodied and targeted Jackson, who was upset about Eminem's depiction of him in the video for \"[[Just Lose It]]\".<ref name=\":1\" />  Retrospectively, the album is often considered to be one of Eminem's worst albums alongside ''[[Revival (Eminem album)|Revival]]'' (2017).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/3053829/eminem-describes-bad-albums/|title=Eminem Describes What Drove Him To Make His 'Bad' Albums|last=Holmes|first=Charles|website=MTV News|language=en|access-date=2019-11-17}}</ref> Eminem himself stated that not only did he rush some of the album because of a leak, but also that; \"''Encore''... [is] not what I would consider one of my better albums\" in an interview with [[Sway Calloway]] in 2018.\n\n==Content==\nThe album contains several lyrical themes, including Eminem's relationship with his ex-wife, Kim, (\"Puke\", and \"Love You More\"), their daughter Hailie Jade Mathers (\"[[Mockingbird (Eminem song)|Mockingbird]]\"), his childhood (\"Yellow Brick Road\"), his relationships with his parents (\"Evil Deeds\"), and opposition to then-American President [[George W. Bush]] (\"[[Mosh (song)|Mosh]]\" and \"We As Americans\")  \"[[Just Lose It]]\" is a parody of [[Michael Jackson]]'s \"[[Billie Jean]]\", as well as his [[Pepsi]] commercial accident in 1984. Similar to Eminem's previous album, ''[[The Eminem Show]]'', ''Encore'' opens with a skit called \"Curtains Up\", indicative of the start of the show, and closes with \"Curtains Down\", indicative of the end.\n\n==Censorship==\n{{refimprove section|date=May 2019}}\nSimultaneously with the original, a [[censorship|censored]] version was released, from which most of the profanities, violent and sexual content, as well the [[recreational drug|drug]] references had been edited out.\n\"My 1st Single\" has a bleep for the word \"fuck\" instead of a muted part on the hook: \"This was supposed to be my first single, but I just fucked that off so... Fuck it let's all have fun let's mingle\", the lines: \"Smack a bitch and slap a ho\" changed to \"Grab a chick and [[Do-si-do]]\". The second and third verses were edited with the words \"Kim\", \"Pornos\", \"Fucking\", and \"Cum\" on the second verse changed to the words; \"Frickin\", \"Videos\", \"Cussing\", and \"Puff\" (with an added explosion noise) respectively, and the third verse editing the word \"Cock\" with a chicken noise, and having \"Dick\" replaced with \"Duck\", along with the censored bleeps in replacement for the word \"Fuck\" as used on the hook. \"Puke\" has the word \"Fucking\" changed to \"Fricking\" throughout the song, \"Shit\" being replaced with \"Shoot\" near the end of the first verse, with the second verse being censored extensively with the line \"You're a fucking cokehead slut, I hope you fucking die\" changed to: \"You're a freaking piece of poop, I hope you freaking die\", and \"I hate your fucking guts, you fucking slut\" changed to \"I hate your freaking guts, you piece of poop\". On \"Just Lose It\", the first verse censors \"Molestation\" with \"Investigation\". In \"We as Americans\" the words dead was back masked in both clean and explicit versions of the song, due to an investigation for the lyrics; \"Fuck money, I don't rap for dead presidents, I'd rather see the president [dead]\". The word \"ass\" is left uncensored in \"Yellow Brick Road\", \"One Shot 2 Shot\", \"Encore\" and \"We As Americans\". However, it is censored out in \"[[Ass Like That]]\", \"[[Mosh (song) |Mosh]]\", \"Spend Some Time\", \"My 1st Single\", and \"[[Just Lose It]]\" (In this song's case, replaced with \"Thing\"), with the song \"Rain Man\", the word \"ass\" is used twice, but only censored once. The word \"goddamn\" was left uncensored in \"Spend Some Time\u201d while \"Yellow Brick Road\" leaves \"goddamn\" uncensored once. Other profanities on all other songs are blanked out; and the song \"Ass Like That\" is listed as \"A** Like That\". \"[[Encore (Eminem song)|Encore]]\" has the shooting sequence at the end of the track removed on the censored album. \"One Shot 2 Shot\" has the violent content edited removing the intro and the word \"shot\" throughout the song. However, the original title remains written on the back cover.\n\n==Artwork and packaging==\nThe album featured two covers, the first cover features Eminem standing in front of an audience, bowing to the crowd. The tray insert features Eminem holding a [[gun]] behind his back. The inlay shows Eminem holding the pistol in his mouth without the jacket of his shirt and tie. The CD itself shows a note written by Eminem saying \"To my family & all my friends, thank you for everything, I will always love you. To my fans, I'm Sorry, Marshall\" with a [[bullet]] underneath the note. The note is also seen in the album's booklet, where Eminem is writing the note. Some pictures show Eminem shooting everybody, which makes a reference to the ending of the album's [[Encore (Eminem song)|title track]]. The second cover features the same audience from the inlay on a black background with a [[blood]] splat on the top right. This cover is used for the Shady Collector's Edition.\n\n==Critical reception==\n{{Album ratings|\n| rev1 = [[AllMusic]]\n| rev1Score = {{Rating|3|5}}<ref name=\"AllMusic\">{{cite web|url={{Allmusic |pure_url=yes |class=album |id=r717546 |tab=review}} |title=Encore -

The song eventually appeared on the album's bonus disc, with the word \"dead\" being reversed.\n\nAbout the album's reception, Eminem said: \"I\u2019m cool with probably half that album. I recorded that towards the height of my addiction. I remember four songs leaked and I had to go to L.A. and get Dre and record new ones. I was in a room by myself writing songs in 25, 30 minutes because we had to get it done, and what came out was so goofy. That\u2019s how I ended up making songs like \u201cRain Man\u201d and \u201cBig Weenie.\u201d They're pretty out there.

It was filmed on March 25 and 26, 2020 and broadcast as a two-night event on April 4 and 5, marking the first time the event was broadcast over two nights as well as aired on [[Broadcast delay|tape delay]]. On PPV, the two productions were sold as individual shows, with both available as a [[Product bundling|package deal]].\n\nThe event was originally scheduled to take place solely on April 5, 2020, at [[Raymond James Stadium]] in [[Tampa, Florida|Tampa]], [[Florida]] and was to air live. In mid-March 2020, all WWE programming was relocated to the [[WWE Performance Center]] training facility in [[Orlando]] due to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]], with [[Behind closed doors (sport)|no audience]] and only essential staff present and air across two nights. The majority of its matches were pre-recorded at the Performance Center between March 25 and 26. Taking advantage of the format, two matches \u2014 a \"[[Buried Alive match|Boneyard match]]\" and a \"Firefly Fun House match\" \u2014 were filmed off-site in atypical, [[filmmaking|cinematic]] style.\n\nThe card comprised nineteen matches which were divided between the two nights, including one match on each night's Kickoff pre-show and a [[Glossary_of_professional_wrestling_terms#dark_match|dark match]] on the second night. In the main event for Part 1, [[The Undertaker]], returning to his \"American Bad Ass\" gimmick, defeated [[AJ Styles]] in a Boneyard match. In other prominent matches, [[Braun Strowman]] defeated [[Bill Goldberg|Goldberg]] to win the [[WWE Universal Championship|Universal Championship]], [[Becky Lynch]] defeated [[Shayna Baszler]] to retain the [[Raw Women's Championship]], and [[Kevin Owens]] defeated [[Seth Rollins]] in a [[No Disqualification match]]. In the main event for Part 2, [[Drew McIntyre]]  defeated [[Brock Lesnar]] to win the [[WWE Championship]], after which, McIntyre retained the title in an impromptu dark match against [[Big Show]] (which was shown on the April 6 episode of ''[[WWE Raw|Raw]]''). In other prominent matches, [[Bray Wyatt|\"The Fiend\" Bray Wyatt]] defeated [[John Cena]] in a Firefly Fun House match, [[Charlotte Flair]] defeated [[Rhea Ripley]] to win the [[NXT Women's Championship]] for a second time, which was the first time an NXT championship was defended at the event, [[Edge (wrestler)|Edge]] defeated [[Randy Orton]] in a [[Last Man Standing match]], which was Edge's first singles match since 2011, and [[Otis Dozovic|Otis]] defeated [[Dolph Ziggler]].\n\nWrestleMania 36 received mostly positive reactions from fans and critics. While it was noted that the event suffered from the absence of a live audience and a poor lead-up (partly due to a number of wrestlers being pulled from the event shortly before its filming, mostly in relation to the pandemic, including [[Roman Reigns]], [[The Miz]], [[Andrade (wrestler)|Andrade]], and [[Dana Brooke]], all of whom were slated to defend or challenge for championships), most felt that WWE exceeded expectations. The Boneyard and Firefly Fun House matches were singled out as highlights due to their uniqueness and over-the-top tone.\n\n==Production==\n===Background===\n[[WrestleMania]] is considered [[WWE]]'s flagship event, having first been held in [[WrestleMania I|1985]].

As Morrison fell, he grasped the titles, unhooking them as he fell, thus Morrison retained the title.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\nAfter that, Kevin Owens faced Seth Rollins. The match ended via a disqualification win for Owens, as Rollins attacked him with the ring bell. Owens then taunted Rollins to face him again in a [[No Disqualification match]], which was accepted. During the match, Owens attacked Rollins with the ring bell and performed a diving elbow drop off the WrestleMania sign. In the end, Owens performed a Stunner on Rollins to win the match.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\nIn a small segment, [[WWE 24/7 Championship|24/7 Champion]] [[R-Truth]] joined Gronkowski and Rawley, who were standing atop a viewing podium. Gronkowski attempted to pin Truth to win the title, however, Rawley moved Gronkowski and pinned Truth instead to win the 24/7 title for the seventh time.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\nIn the penultimate and final match from the Performance Center, Goldberg defended the Universal Championship against Braun Strowman. As Strowman attempted a Running Powerslam on Goldberg, Goldberg countered and performed three Spears for a near fall. Goldberg then performed a fourth Spear on Strowman. As Goldberg attempted the Jackhammer, Strowman countered and performed four Running Powerslams on Goldberg to win the title for the first time, as well as his first world championship.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\n====Main event====\nIn the main event of Part 1, The Undertaker faced AJ Styles in a Boneyard match, which was a [[Buried Alive match]] set at an undisclosed [[cemetery]] and warehouse in the Orlando area. A hearse arrived at the cemetery to The Undertaker's theme music, however, Styles emerged from the casket. The Undertaker then arrived riding a motorcycle (reminiscent of his [[The Undertaker#American Bad Ass (2000\u20132001)|\"American Bad Ass\" gimmick]]) to the tune of [[Metallica]]'s \"[[Now That We're Dead]]\". Halfway through the match, Styles' O.C. teammates Luke Gallows and Karl Anderson appeared in an attempt to assist Styles, but The Undertaker fought them off. The Undertaker then fought a group of druids before Styles gained the upper hand again. Styles attacked Undertaker with a spade which caused Undertaker to fall in the grave. As Styles was preparing to drop dirt on Undertaker to bury him and win, Undertaker appeared behind Styles and started to attack him. Undertaker and Styles fought all over the graveyard and atop the warehouse rooftop. Undertaker then fought Gallows and Anderson on the rooftop. He then threw Gallows off the rooftop, performed a Tombstone Piledriver on Anderson, and chokeslammed Styles off the rooftop. Undertaker then threw Styles into the grave, started the tractor, and dumped all the dirt in the grave to win the match. Following the match, as the camera panned on the grave, Styles' hand was sticking out from the dirt, while Undertaker then departed on his motorcycle, again to the Metallica song.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\n===<!--This is the official listing on the WWE Network-->Part 2<!--This is the official listing on the WWE Network-->===\n{|class=wikitable style=\"font-size:90%; margin: 0.5em 0 0.5em 1em; float: right; clear: right;\"\n|+'''Other on-screen personnel \u2013 Part 2'''\n!|Role\n!|Name\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"|Hosts\n|[[Rob Gronkowski]]\n|-\n|[[Titus O'Neil]]\n|-\n|rowspan=\"4\"|English Commentators\n|[[Michael Cole (wrestling)|Michael Cole]] {{small|(SmackDown)}}\n|-\n|[[John Layfield|John \"Bradshaw\" Layfield]] {{small|(SmackDown)}}\n|-\n|[[Tom Phillips (wrestling)|Tom Phillips]] {{small|(Raw/NXT Women's Championship match)}}\n|-\n|[[Byron Saxton]] {{small|(Raw/NXT Women's Championship match)}}\n|-\n|Spanish commentator\n|[[Carlos Cabrera]]<ref name=\"Spanishannouncers\"/>\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"|Ring announcers\n|Greg Hamilton {{small|(SmackDown)}}\n|-\n|[[Mike Rome]] {{small|(Raw/NXT Women's Championship match)}}\n|-\n|rowspan=\"7\"|Referees\n|Danilo Anfibio\n|-\n|Shawn Bennett\n|-\n|[[John Cone]]\n|-\n|Darrick Moore\n|-\n|Eddie Orengo\n|-\n|[[Charles Robinson (referee)|Charles Robinson]]\n|-\n|[[Drake Younger|Drake Wuertz]]\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"|Interviewers\n|Charly Caruso\n|-\n|Kayla Braxton\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"|Pre-show panel\n|[[Corey Graves]]\n|-\n|[[Peter Rosenberg]]\n|-\n|rowspan=\"3\"|Pre-show correspondents\n|[[Renee Young]]\n|-\n|[[Booker T (wrestler)|Booker T]]\n|-\n|[[Christian (wrestler)|Christian]]\n|}\n\n====Pre-show====\nDuring the WrestleMania 36 Kickoff Part 2 pre-show, [[Liv Morgan]] faced [[Natalya Neidhart|Natalya]]. In the end, Morgan pinned Natalya with a roll-up to win the match.<ref name=\"preWM36Part2\"/>\n\n====Preliminary matches====\nThe actual pay-per-view portion of Part 2 opened with Rhea Ripley defending the NXT Women's Championship against Charlotte Flair. In the climax, After a back-and-forth match, Flair forced Ripley to tap out to the Figure-Eight Leglock to win the title for a second time \u2013 and the first time since [[NXT TakeOver (2014)|NXT TakeOver]] in 2014. Flair also became the first wrestler to win an NXT championship before and after NXT became one of WWE's three main brands.<ref name=\"WM36Part2\"/>\n\nNext, Aleister Black faced [[Bobby Lashley]] (accompanied by [[Lana (wrestler)|Lana]]). In the end, as Lashley attempted a Spear on Black, Black performed a Black Mass on Lashley to win the match.<ref name=\"WM36Part2\"/>\n\nAfter that, Otis faced Dolph Ziggler (accompanied by Sonya Deville). In the closing moments, as Otis attempted to perform the Caterpillar on Ziggler, Deville distracted Otis on the ring apron, which allowed Ziggler to attack Otis with a low blow from behind. Deville's tag team partner, Mandy Rose, came out and attacked Deville. With the referee distracted, Rose also performed a low blow on Ziggler. Otis then performed the Caterpillar on Ziggler to win the match. Following the match, Otis and Rose shared a kiss in the ring.<ref name=\"WM36Part2\"/>\n\nIn the fourth match, Edge faced Randy Orton in a Last Man Standing match. As Edge waited for Orton to make his entrance, Orton \u2013 who had been disguised as a cameraman \u2013 attacked Edge from behind with an RKO. Orton then attacked Edge with a second RKO and a camera, but Edge rose to his feet. Edge and Orton then fought in the Performance Center's gym area, where Orton placed Edge's arms in a sling and proceeded to attack him. As Orton attempted to attack Edge with a weight, Edge performed a dropkick on him. The two then fought back to the ringside area, where Orton threw Edge into a barricade off a raised platform. After fighting all throughout the Performance Center, they eventually fought atop a production truck where Edge performed a spear on Orton and Orton performed an RKO on Edge. In the end, Edge applied a sleeper hold on Orton, who passed out on a chair. A conflicted Edge then performed the Conchairto on Orton. Edge won the match after Orton was unable to answer the referee's 10 count.<ref name=\"WM36Part2\"/>\n\nNext, The Street Profits (Angelo Dawkins and Montez Ford) defended the Raw Tag Team Championship against Angel Garza and Austin Theory (with Zelina Vega). In the closing moments, Ford performed a Springboard Frogsplash on Theory, who was then pinned by Dawkins. After the match, Garza, Theory, and Vega attacked the Street Profits. NXT's [[Bianca Belair]] then ran out and attacked Vega, clearing the ring.<ref name=\"WM36Part2\"/>\n\nIn a small segment, new 24/7 Champion Mojo Rawley ran away from multiple wrestlers into the Performance Center. They cornered Rawley near the podium host Rob Gronkowski was standing on. Gronkowski witnessed this and performed a dive on top of the wrestlers. Gronkowski then pinned Rawley to win the 24/7 Championship.<ref name=\"WM36Part2\"/>\n\nAfter that, Bayley defended the SmackDown Women's Championship in a fatal five-way elimination match against Sasha Banks, Lacey Evans, Naomi, and Tamina. Tamina was the first eliminated after all the other wrestlers piled on top of her for the pin. Banks applied the Bank Statement on Naomi to eliminate her. As Bayley attempted a dropkick on Evans in the corner, Evans moved out of the way and Bayley attacked Banks instead. After Bayley tried apologizing, Bayley pushed Banks out of the way of an attack from Evans, who performed the Woman's Right on Banks to eliminate her. Bayley did not attempt to break up the pin to save Banks. In the end, as Evans was about to perform the Woman's Right on Bayley, Banks returned to the ring and performed a Backstabber on Evans. Bayley then performed a DDT on Evans to retain the title.<ref name=\"WM36Part2\"/>\n\nThe penultimate match was the Firefly Fun House match between John Cena and \"The Fiend\" Bray Wyatt. Cena came out for his match in the Performance Center, assuming his match was taking place in the ring. Wyatt was then shown in the Firefly Fun House, stating that Cena would actually be facing himself before exiting through the fun house's door. Cena was then teleported to the Firefly Fun House. After also going through the door, Cena was transported through a series of [[dream sequence]]s where Wyatt demonstrated his perceived personality flaws (such as being a bully who did not have to work for his achievements like Wyatt did), including his debut appearance on ''SmackDown'' (with Wyatt acting as [[Kurt Angle]], and Cena seemingly unable to say anything but \"[[History of WWE#Ruthless Aggression Era (2002-2008)|ruthless aggression]]\"), and a spoof of ''[[Saturday Night's Main Event]]'' (where Wyatt introduced Cena as his tag team partner \"Johnny Largemeat\", who was tired out from repeatedly lifting weights). Appearing as his old [[The Wyatt Family|Wyatt Family]] self, Wyatt then reminisced about his loss to Cena at [[WrestleMania XXX]], and pledged to right his previous wrong. Back in a ring, Cena reversed out of an attempted Sister Abigail by Wyatt, and was (as in that previous match) coerced into using a chair against him. However, as he did so, Wyatt disappeared, and Cena was suddenly transported to ''[[WCW Monday Nitro|nWo Monday Nitro]]''\u2014with Cena acting as [[Hulk Hogan|\"Hollywood\" Hulk Hogan]] and Wyatt acting as [[Eric Bischoff]]. In the ring, Cena tackled Wyatt. After a fury of fists, Wyatt disappeared and was replaced by the Huskus the Pig Boy puppet. The Fiend then snuck up from behind and performed Sister Abigail and the Mandible Claw on Cena to win the match, with Wyatt's normal self counting the pin. Just before The Fiend performed Sister Abigail, the audio of Cena's promo from ''SmackDown'' was played, where Cena had stated that at WrestleMania, he would end the existence of the \"most over hyped, over valued, over privileged WWE Superstar\".<ref name=\"WM36Part2\"/><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cbssports.com/wwe/news/wwe-wrestlemania-36-results-firefly-funhouse-boneyard-matches-lead-best-moments-from-surreal-2020-show/|title=WWE WrestleMania 36 results: Firefly FunHouse, Boneyard matches lead best moments from surreal 2020 show|website=CBSSports.com|language=en|access-date=2020-04-08}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://africa.espn.com/wwe/story/_/id/28997784/wwe-wrestlemania-36-live-results-recaps-analysis|title=WrestleMania 36: McIntyre stops Lesnar, Gronk wins 24/7 title|date=2020-04-05|website=ESPN.com|language=en|access-date=2020-04-08}}</ref>\n\n====Main event====\nIn the main event of Part 2, Brock Lesnar (accompanied by [[Paul Heyman]]) defended the WWE Championship against Drew McIntyre. McIntyre started off with a Claymore Kick on Lesnar for a nearfall. Lesnar performed three German suplexes and an F-5, but McIntyre kicked out at one. Lesnar then performed two more F-5's, both of which again resulted in nearfalls. As Lesnar went for a fourth F-5, McIntyre countered and performed three more Claymore Kicks on Lesnar to win the title, capturing his first world championship in WWE.<ref name=\"WM36Part2\"/> and becoming the first-ever British-born world champion in WWE history, as well as WWE's thirty-first [[Triple_Crown_(professional_wrestling)#WWE|Triple Crown]] champion. After the show went off the air, McIntyre was confronted by [[Big Show]], who McIntyre then faced in a title defense described by WWE as the \"hidden WrestleMania main event.\"<ref>{{cite tweet |author=WWE WrestleMania|user=WrestleMania|number=1247357532789768194|date=April 6, 2020 |title=Your hidden #WrestleMania main event has been unlocked. #WWERaw @WWETheBigShow @DMcIntyreWWE |access-date=April 7, 2020}}</ref> McIntyre performed a Claymore Kick on Big Show to retain the title.

While most agreed that WrestleMania 36 suffered from both a poor lead-up and the absence of a live audience, many felt that the event exceeded expectations, with both critics and fans largely praising the Boneyard and Firefly Fun House matches as the best of the event for their uniqueness and over-the-top tone (and in the case of the latter, its inventiveness and humor); the SmackDown Tag Team Championship match and Owens vs. Rollins were also singled out by most critics.<ref name=\"HollywoodReporterReview\">{{Cite web |last=Szalai |first=Georg |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/how-wwe-pulled-wrestlemania-36-fans-business-impact-1288659 |title=How WWE Pulled Off WrestleMania 36 Without Fans and What It Means for Its Business and Future |publisher=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date=April 6, 2020 |accessdate=April 8, 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"SlateReview\">{{Cite web |last=Bixenspan |first=David |url=https://slate.com/culture/2020/04/wrestlemania-36-no-fans-audience-coronavirus-undertaker-john-cena.html |title=WrestleMania Still Happened Last Weekend.

Club]]'' gave the event a B\u2013. While praising WWE for making the most out of its \"weirdest WrestleMania of all time\", particularly praising the Boneyard match, he did point out that most matches suffered from its poor lead-up and lack of live audience, stating notably that Becky Lynch and Shayna Baszler's match was \"a listless and too-short battle that, when you consider the response both performers tend to extract from crowds, might have shifted into another gear in a packed stadium.\" He also cited examples of \"shoddy storytelling\", noting that it \"[was] great that Braun Strowman beat the snot out of Goldberg, but it might have resonated more if the company hadn't just had the 53-year old Goldberg destroy The Fiend, a heretofore untouchable star, during a [[Super ShowDown (2020)| PPV in Saudi Arabia]]\u2014and, you know, done anything with Braun over the past few years.\"<ref name=\"AVCReview\">{{Cite web |last=Colbrun |first=Randall |url=https://tv.avclub.com/the-weirdest-wrestlemania-of-all-time-at-least-figured-1842699373 |title=The Weirdest Wrestlemania of All Time at Least Figured Out How to Use Its Legends |work=[[The A.

Others decided to play to a crowd that wasn't actually there. [...] the WWE style\u2014with its emphasis on overwrought capital\u2013P 'performance,' over-rehearsed matches, and flowery mannerisms\u2014looked more like a parody when staged in front of zero spectators. Still, expectations for this WrestleMania were low, albeit with some minor optimism over the show being divided up into two nights instead of the marathon one-night slogs of recent years.\" However, he stated that after two lackluster opening matches, the card from Lynch vs. Baszler onward was \"very physical matches [which] made the best of the setting, and with most of the matches fitting that bill, [Part 1] was really strong overall\", although he found Part 2 much weaker, stating that Edge vs. Randy Orton was \"glacially slow, and it appeared to somehow be edited out of an even longer match\", and that Lesnar vs. McIntyre felt \"more like a formality than anything cool, because it was so paint-by-numbers.\" ''Slate'' considered the Boneyard and Firefly Fun House matches to be the best matches.<ref name=\"SlateReview\"/>\n\n''[[Bleacher Report]]'' stated \"It's hard to judge this event. You have to take the good with the bad, maintain honest integrity with criticism, but also be forgiving and acknowledge that this was not how WrestleMania was supposed to be.\" They gave a positive review, although they ranked Elias vs. Corbin, Black vs. Lashley, and the SmackDown Women's title match as the low points of the event.<ref name=\"BleacherReview1\">{{Cite web |last=Mango |first=Anthony |url=https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2883707-wwe-wrestlemania-36-results-reviewing-top-highlights-and-low-points-of-day-1 |title=WWE WrestleMania 36 Results: Reviewing Top Highlights and Low Points of Day 1 |publisher=[[Bleacher Report]] |date=April 5, 2020 |accessdate=April 8, 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"BleacherReview2\">{{Cite web |last=Mango |first=Anthony |url=https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2883709-wwe-wrestlemania-36-results-reviewing-top-highlights-and-low-points-of-day-2 |title=WWE WrestleMania 36 Results: Reviewing Top Highlights and Low Points of Day 2 |publisher=[[Bleacher Report]] |date=April 6, 2020 |accessdate=April 8, 2020}}</ref> Additionally, ''Bleacher Report'' gave the Boneyard match a 4.5 star ratings on a scale of 5, their highest rated match from both nights, while giving the Universal Championship match a 0.5 star, their lowest rated match from the event.<ref>{{cit web|url=https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2885202-wwe-wrestlemania-36-results-star-ratings-for-all-matches-from-full-show|title=WWE WrestleMania 36 Results: Star Ratings for All Matches from Full Show|author=Rill, Jake|date=April 6, 2020|accessdate=April 8, 2020|work=Bleacher Report}}</ref>\n\n''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' noted that the Boneyard and Firefly Fun House matches could set a precedent for WWE using more \"cinematic experiences\" in its programming to make up for the closed door tapings.<ref name=\"HollywoodReporterReview\"/>\n\n==Aftermath==\n===Raw===\nThe following night's episode of ''Raw'' showed the \"hidden WrestleMania main event\", in which Drew McIntyre retained the WWE Championship over Big Show roughly 25 minutes after McIntyre had defeated Brock Lesnar to win the title.<ref name=\"Raw04062020\">{{cite web|url=https://prowrestling.net/site/2020/04/06/4-6-wwe-raw-results-powells-live-review-of-the-night-after-wrestlemania-36-edition-featuring-new-wwe-champion-drew-mcintyre-whats-next-for-edge-seth-rollins-becky-lynch-and-shayna-baszler/|title=4/6 WWE Raw Results: Powell\u2019s live review of the night after WrestleMania 36 edition featuring new WWE Champion Drew McIntyre, what\u2019s next for Edge, Seth Rollins, Becky Lynch, and Shayna Baszler|date=April 6, 2020|last=Powell|first=Jason|work=Pro Wrestling Dot Net|accessdate=April 18, 2020}}</ref>\n\nRaw Women's Champion Becky Lynch praised Shayna Baszler in their WrestleMania match and stated that Baszler knew where to find her if she wanted to face off again.<ref name=\"Raw04062020\"/> The following week, Baszler won her qualifying match to compete in the women's [[Money in the Bank ladder match]].<ref name=\"Raw04132020\">{{cite web|url=https://prowrestling.net/site/2020/04/13/4-13-wwe-raw-results-powells-live-review-of-drew-mcintyre-and-becky-lynch-appearances-money-in-the-bank-qualifying-matches-featuring-asuka-vs-ruby-riott-kairi-sane-vs-nia-jax-and-sarah-logan-v/|title=4/13 WWE Raw Results: Powell\u2019s live review of Drew McIntyre and Becky Lynch appearances, Money in the Bank qualifying matches featuring Asuka vs. Ruby Riott, Kairi Sane vs. Nia Jax, and Sarah Logan vs. Shayna Baszler|date=April 13, 2020|last=Powell|first=Jason|work=Pro Wresting Dot Net|accessdate=April 18, 2020}}</ref>\n\nRaw Tag Team Champions The Street Profits (Angelo Dawkins and Montez Ford) had a rematch with Austin Theory and Angel Garza (with Zelina Vega) where they again retained, though by disqualification thanks to Vega.

It was filmed on March 25 and 26, 2020 and broadcast as a two-night event on April 4 and 5, marking the first time the event was broadcast over two nights as well as aired on [[Broadcast delay|tape delay]]. On PPV, the two productions were sold as individual shows, with both available as a [[Product bundling|package deal]].\n\nThe event was originally scheduled to take place solely on April 5, 2020, at [[Raymond James Stadium]] in [[Tampa, Florida|Tampa]], [[Florida]] and was to air live. In mid-March 2020, all WWE programming was relocated to the [[WWE Performance Center]] training facility in [[Orlando]] due to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]], with [[Behind closed doors (sport)|no audience]] and only essential staff present and air across two nights. The majority of its matches were pre-recorded at the Performance Center between March 25 and 26. Taking advantage of the format, two matches \u2014 a \"[[Buried Alive match|Boneyard match]]\" and a \"Firefly Fun House match\" \u2014 were filmed off-site in atypical, [[filmmaking|cinematic]] style.\n\nThe card comprised nineteen matches which were divided between the two nights, including one match on each night's Kickoff pre-show and a [[Glossary_of_professional_wrestling_terms#dark_match|dark match]] on the second night. In the main event for Part 1, [[The Undertaker]], returning to his \"American Bad Ass\" gimmick, defeated [[AJ Styles]] in a Boneyard match. In other prominent matches, [[Braun Strowman]] defeated [[Bill Goldberg|Goldberg]] to win the [[WWE Universal Championship|Universal Championship]], [[Becky Lynch]] defeated [[Shayna Baszler]] to retain the [[Raw Women's Championship]], and [[Kevin Owens]] defeated [[Seth Rollins]] in a [[No Disqualification match]]. In the main event for Part 2, [[Drew McIntyre]]  defeated [[Brock Lesnar]] to win the [[WWE Championship]], after which, McIntyre retained the title in an impromptu dark match against [[Big Show]] (which was shown on the April 6 episode of ''[[WWE Raw|Raw]]''). In other prominent matches, [[Bray Wyatt|\"The Fiend\" Bray Wyatt]] defeated [[John Cena]] in a Firefly Fun House match, [[Charlotte Flair]] defeated [[Rhea Ripley]] to win the [[NXT Women's Championship]] for a second time, which was the first time an NXT championship was defended at the event, [[Edge (wrestler)|Edge]] defeated [[Randy Orton]] in a [[Last Man Standing match]], which was Edge's first singles match since 2011, and [[Otis Dozovic|Otis]] defeated [[Dolph Ziggler]].\n\nWrestleMania 36 received mostly positive reactions from fans and critics. While it was noted that the event suffered from the absence of a live audience and a poor lead-up (partly due to a number of wrestlers being pulled from the event shortly before its filming, mostly in relation to the pandemic, including [[Roman Reigns]], [[The Miz]], [[Andrade (wrestler)|Andrade]], and [[Dana Brooke]], all of whom were slated to defend or challenge for championships), most felt that WWE exceeded expectations. The Boneyard and Firefly Fun House matches were singled out as highlights due to their uniqueness and over-the-top tone.\n\n==Production==\n===Background===\n[[WrestleMania]] is considered [[WWE]]'s flagship event, having first been held in [[WrestleMania I|1985]].

As Morrison fell, he grasped the titles, unhooking them as he fell, thus Morrison retained the title.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\nAfter that, Kevin Owens faced Seth Rollins. The match ended via a disqualification win for Owens, as Rollins attacked him with the ring bell. Owens then taunted Rollins to face him again in a [[No Disqualification match]], which was accepted. During the match, Owens attacked Rollins with the ring bell and performed a diving elbow drop off the WrestleMania sign. In the end, Owens performed a Stunner on Rollins to win the match.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\nIn a small segment, [[WWE 24/7 Championship|24/7 Champion]] [[R-Truth]] joined Gronkowski and Rawley, who were standing atop a viewing podium. Gronkowski attempted to pin Truth to win the title, however, Rawley moved Gronkowski and pinned Truth instead to win the 24/7 title for the seventh time.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\nIn the penultimate and final match from the Performance Center, Goldberg defended the Universal Championship against Braun Strowman. As Strowman attempted a Running Powerslam on Goldberg, Goldberg countered and performed three Spears for a near fall. Goldberg then performed a fourth Spear on Strowman. As Goldberg attempted the Jackhammer, Strowman countered and performed four Running Powerslams on Goldberg to win the title for the first time, as well as his first world championship.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\n====Main event====\nIn the main event of Part 1, The Undertaker faced AJ Styles in a Boneyard match, which was a [[Buried Alive match]] set at an undisclosed [[cemetery]] and warehouse in the Orlando area. A hearse arrived at the cemetery to The Undertaker's theme music, however, Styles emerged from the casket. The Undertaker then arrived riding a motorcycle (reminiscent of his [[The Undertaker#American Bad Ass (2000\u20132001)|\"American Bad Ass\" gimmick]]) to the tune of [[Metallica]]'s \"[[Now That We're Dead]]\". Halfway through the match, Styles' O.C. teammates Luke Gallows and Karl Anderson appeared in an attempt to assist Styles, but The Undertaker fought them off. The Undertaker then fought a group of druids before Styles gained the upper hand again. Styles attacked Undertaker with a spade which caused Undertaker to fall in the grave. As Styles was preparing to drop dirt on Undertaker to bury him and win, Undertaker appeared behind Styles and started to attack him. Undertaker and Styles fought all over the graveyard and atop the warehouse rooftop. Undertaker then fought Gallows and Anderson on the rooftop. He then threw Gallows off the rooftop, performed a Tombstone Piledriver on Anderson, and chokeslammed Styles off the rooftop. Undertaker then threw Styles into the grave, started the tractor, and dumped all the dirt in the grave to win the match. Following the match, as the camera panned on the grave, Styles' hand was sticking out from the dirt, while Undertaker then departed on his motorcycle, again to the Metallica song.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\n===<!--This is the official listing on the WWE Network-->Part 2<!--This is the official listing on the WWE Network-->===\n{|class=wikitable style=\"font-size:90%; margin: 0.5em 0 0.5em 1em; float: right; clear: right;\"\n|+'''Other on-screen personnel \u2013 Part 2'''\n!|Role\n!|Name\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"|Hosts\n|[[Rob Gronkowski]]\n|-\n|[[Titus O'Neil]]\n|-\n|rowspan=\"4\"|English Commentators\n|[[Michael Cole (wrestling)|Michael Cole]] {{small|(SmackDown)}}\n|-\n|[[John Layfield|John \"Bradshaw\" Layfield]] {{small|(SmackDown)}}\n|-\n|[[Tom Phillips (wrestling)|Tom Phillips]] {{small|(Raw/NXT Women's Championship match)}}\n|-\n|[[Byron Saxton]] {{small|(Raw/NXT Women's Championship match)}}\n|-\n|Spanish commentator\n|[[Carlos Cabrera]]<ref name=\"Spanishannouncers\"/>\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"|Ring announcers\n|Greg Hamilton {{small|(SmackDown)}}\n|-\n|[[Mike Rome]] {{small|(Raw/NXT Women's Championship match)}}\n|-\n|rowspan=\"7\"|Referees\n|Danilo Anfibio\n|-\n|Shawn Bennett\n|-\n|[[John Cone]]\n|-\n|Darrick Moore\n|-\n|Eddie Orengo\n|-\n|[[Charles Robinson (referee)|Charles Robinson]]\n|-\n|[[Drake Younger|Drake Wuertz]]\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"|Interviewers\n|Charly Caruso\n|-\n|Kayla Braxton\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"|Pre-show panel\n|[[Corey Graves]]\n|-\n|[[Peter Rosenberg]]\n|-\n|rowspan=\"3\"|Pre-show correspondents\n|[[Renee Young]]\n|-\n|[[Booker T (wrestler)|Booker T]]\n|-\n|[[Christian (wrestler)|Christian]]\n|}\n\n====Pre-show====\nDuring the WrestleMania 36 Kickoff Part 2 pre-show, [[Liv Morgan]] faced [[Natalya Neidhart|Natalya]]. In the end, Morgan pinned Natalya with a roll-up to win the match.<ref name=\"preWM36Part2\"/>\n\n====Preliminary matches====\nThe actual pay-per-view portion of Part 2 opened with Rhea Ripley defending the NXT Women's Championship against Charlotte Flair. In the climax, After a back-and-forth match, Flair forced Ripley to tap out to the Figure-Eight Leglock to win the title for a second time \u2013 and the first time since [[NXT TakeOver (2014)|NXT TakeOver]] in 2014. Flair also became the first wrestler to win an NXT championship before and after NXT became one of WWE's three main brands.<ref name=\"WM36Part2\"/>\n\nNext, Aleister Black faced [[Bobby Lashley]] (accompanied by [[Lana (wrestler)|Lana]]). In the end, as Lashley attempted a Spear on Black, Black performed a Black Mass on Lashley to win the match.<ref name=\"WM36Part2\"/>\n\nAfter that, Otis faced Dolph Ziggler (accompanied by Sonya Deville). In the closing moments, as Otis attempted to perform the Caterpillar on Ziggler, Deville distracted Otis on the ring apron, which allowed Ziggler to attack Otis with a low blow from behind. Deville's tag team partner, Mandy Rose, came out and attacked Deville. With the referee distracted, Rose also performed a low blow on Ziggler. Otis then performed the Caterpillar on Ziggler to win the match. Following the match, Otis and Rose shared a kiss in the ring.<ref name=\"WM36Part2\"/>\n\nIn the fourth match, Edge faced Randy Orton in a Last Man Standing match. As Edge waited for Orton to make his entrance, Orton \u2013 who had been disguised as a cameraman \u2013 attacked Edge from behind with an RKO. Orton then attacked Edge with a second RKO and a camera, but Edge rose to his feet. Edge and Orton then fought in the Performance Center's gym area, where Orton placed Edge's arms in a sling and proceeded to attack him. As Orton attempted to attack Edge with a weight, Edge performed a dropkick on him. The two then fought back to the ringside area, where Orton threw Edge into a barricade off a raised platform. After fighting all throughout the Performance Center, they eventually fought atop a production truck where Edge performed a spear on Orton and Orton performed an RKO on Edge. In the end, Edge applied a sleeper hold on Orton, who passed out on a chair. A conflicted Edge then performed the Conchairto on Orton. Edge won the match after Orton was unable to answer the referee's 10 count.<ref name=\"WM36Part2\"/>\n\nNext, The Street Profits (Angelo Dawkins and Montez Ford) defended the Raw Tag Team Championship against Angel Garza and Austin Theory (with Zelina Vega). In the closing moments, Ford performed a Springboard Frogsplash on Theory, who was then pinned by Dawkins. After the match, Garza, Theory, and Vega attacked the Street Profits. NXT's [[Bianca Belair]] then ran out and attacked Vega, clearing the ring.<ref name=\"WM36Part2\"/>\n\nIn a small segment, new 24/7 Champion Mojo Rawley ran away from multiple wrestlers into the Performance Center. They cornered Rawley near the podium host Rob Gronkowski was standing on. Gronkowski witnessed this and performed a dive on top of the wrestlers. Gronkowski then pinned Rawley to win the 24/7 Championship.<ref name=\"WM36Part2\"/>\n\nAfter that, Bayley defended the SmackDown Women's Championship in a fatal five-way elimination match against Sasha Banks, Lacey Evans, Naomi, and Tamina. Tamina was the first eliminated after all the other wrestlers piled on top of her for the pin. Banks applied the Bank Statement on Naomi to eliminate her. As Bayley attempted a dropkick on Evans in the corner, Evans moved out of the way and Bayley attacked Banks instead. After Bayley tried apologizing, Bayley pushed Banks out of the way of an attack from Evans, who performed the Woman's Right on Banks to eliminate her. Bayley did not attempt to break up the pin to save Banks. In the end, as Evans was about to perform the Woman's Right on Bayley, Banks returned to the ring and performed a Backstabber on Evans. Bayley then performed a DDT on Evans to retain the title.<ref name=\"WM36Part2\"/>\n\nThe penultimate match was the Firefly Fun House match between John Cena and \"The Fiend\" Bray Wyatt. Cena came out for his match in the Performance Center, assuming his match was taking place in the ring. Wyatt was then shown in the Firefly Fun House, stating that Cena would actually be facing himself before exiting through the fun house's door. Cena was then teleported to the Firefly Fun House. After also going through the door, Cena was transported through a series of [[dream sequence]]s where Wyatt demonstrated his perceived personality flaws (such as being a bully who did not have to work for his achievements like Wyatt did), including his debut appearance on ''SmackDown'' (with Wyatt acting as [[Kurt Angle]], and Cena seemingly unable to say anything but \"[[History of WWE#Ruthless Aggression Era (2002-2008)|ruthless aggression]]\"), and a spoof of ''[[Saturday Night's Main Event]]'' (where Wyatt introduced Cena as his tag team partner \"Johnny Largemeat\", who was tired out from repeatedly lifting weights). Appearing as his old [[The Wyatt Family|Wyatt Family]] self, Wyatt then reminisced about his loss to Cena at [[WrestleMania XXX]], and pledged to right his previous wrong. Back in a ring, Cena reversed out of an attempted Sister Abigail by Wyatt, and was (as in that previous match) coerced into using a chair against him. However, as he did so, Wyatt disappeared, and Cena was suddenly transported to ''[[WCW Monday Nitro|nWo Monday Nitro]]''\u2014with Cena acting as [[Hulk Hogan|\"Hollywood\" Hulk Hogan]] and Wyatt acting as [[Eric Bischoff]]. In the ring, Cena tackled Wyatt. After a fury of fists, Wyatt disappeared and was replaced by the Huskus the Pig Boy puppet. The Fiend then snuck up from behind and performed Sister Abigail and the Mandible Claw on Cena to win the match, with Wyatt's normal self counting the pin. Just before The Fiend performed Sister Abigail, the audio of Cena's promo from ''SmackDown'' was played, where Cena had stated that at WrestleMania, he would end the existence of the \"most over hyped, over valued, over privileged WWE Superstar\".<ref name=\"WM36Part2\"/><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cbssports.com/wwe/news/wwe-wrestlemania-36-results-firefly-funhouse-boneyard-matches-lead-best-moments-from-surreal-2020-show/|title=WWE WrestleMania 36 results: Firefly FunHouse, Boneyard matches lead best moments from surreal 2020 show|website=CBSSports.com|language=en|access-date=2020-04-08}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://africa.espn.com/wwe/story/_/id/28997784/wwe-wrestlemania-36-live-results-recaps-analysis|title=WrestleMania 36: McIntyre stops Lesnar, Gronk wins 24/7 title|date=2020-04-05|website=ESPN.com|language=en|access-date=2020-04-08}}</ref>\n\n====Main event====\nIn the main event of Part 2, Brock Lesnar (accompanied by [[Paul Heyman]]) defended the WWE Championship against Drew McIntyre. McIntyre started off with a Claymore Kick on Lesnar for a nearfall. Lesnar performed three German suplexes and an F-5, but McIntyre kicked out at one. Lesnar then performed two more F-5's, both of which again resulted in nearfalls. As Lesnar went for a fourth F-5, McIntyre countered and performed three more Claymore Kicks on Lesnar to win the title, capturing his first world championship in WWE.<ref name=\"WM36Part2\"/> and becoming the first-ever British-born world champion in WWE history, as well as WWE's thirty-first [[Triple_Crown_(professional_wrestling)#WWE|Triple Crown]] champion. After the show went off the air, McIntyre was confronted by [[Big Show]], who McIntyre then faced in a title defense described by WWE as the \"hidden WrestleMania main event.\"<ref>{{cite tweet |author=WWE WrestleMania|user=WrestleMania|number=1247357532789768194|date=April 6, 2020 |title=Your hidden #WrestleMania main event has been unlocked. #WWERaw @WWETheBigShow @DMcIntyreWWE |access-date=April 7, 2020}}</ref> McIntyre performed a Claymore Kick on Big Show to retain the title.

While most agreed that WrestleMania 36 suffered from both a poor lead-up and the absence of a live audience, many felt that the event exceeded expectations, with both critics and fans largely praising the Boneyard and Firefly Fun House matches as the best of the event for their uniqueness and over-the-top tone (and in the case of the latter, its inventiveness and humor); the SmackDown Tag Team Championship match and Owens vs. Rollins were also singled out by most critics.<ref name=\"HollywoodReporterReview\">{{Cite web |last=Szalai |first=Georg |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/how-wwe-pulled-wrestlemania-36-fans-business-impact-1288659 |title=How WWE Pulled Off WrestleMania 36 Without Fans and What It Means for Its Business and Future |publisher=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date=April 6, 2020 |accessdate=April 8, 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"SlateReview\">{{Cite web |last=Bixenspan |first=David |url=https://slate.com/culture/2020/04/wrestlemania-36-no-fans-audience-coronavirus-undertaker-john-cena.html |title=WrestleMania Still Happened Last Weekend.

Club]]'' gave the event a B\u2013. While praising WWE for making the most out of its \"weirdest WrestleMania of all time\", particularly praising the Boneyard match, he did point out that most matches suffered from its poor lead-up and lack of live audience, stating notably that Becky Lynch and Shayna Baszler's match was \"a listless and too-short battle that, when you consider the response both performers tend to extract from crowds, might have shifted into another gear in a packed stadium.\" He also cited examples of \"shoddy storytelling\", noting that it \"[was] great that Braun Strowman beat the snot out of Goldberg, but it might have resonated more if the company hadn't just had the 53-year old Goldberg destroy The Fiend, a heretofore untouchable star, during a [[Super ShowDown (2020)| PPV in Saudi Arabia]]\u2014and, you know, done anything with Braun over the past few years.\"<ref name=\"AVCReview\">{{Cite web |last=Colbrun |first=Randall |url=https://tv.avclub.com/the-weirdest-wrestlemania-of-all-time-at-least-figured-1842699373 |title=The Weirdest Wrestlemania of All Time at Least Figured Out How to Use Its Legends |work=[[The A.

Others decided to play to a crowd that wasn't actually there. [...] the WWE style\u2014with its emphasis on overwrought capital\u2013P 'performance,' over-rehearsed matches, and flowery mannerisms\u2014looked more like a parody when staged in front of zero spectators. Still, expectations for this WrestleMania were low, albeit with some minor optimism over the show being divided up into two nights instead of the marathon one-night slogs of recent years.\" However, he stated that after two lackluster opening matches, the card from Lynch vs. Baszler onward was \"very physical matches [which] made the best of the setting, and with most of the matches fitting that bill, [Part 1] was really strong overall\", although he found Part 2 much weaker, stating that Edge vs. Randy Orton was \"glacially slow, and it appeared to somehow be edited out of an even longer match\", and that Lesnar vs. McIntyre felt \"more like a formality than anything cool, because it was so paint-by-numbers.\" ''Slate'' considered the Boneyard and Firefly Fun House matches to be the best matches.<ref name=\"SlateReview\"/>\n\n''[[Bleacher Report]]'' stated \"It's hard to judge this event. You have to take the good with the bad, maintain honest integrity with criticism, but also be forgiving and acknowledge that this was not how WrestleMania was supposed to be.\" They gave a positive review, although they ranked Elias vs. Corbin, Black vs. Lashley, and the SmackDown Women's title match as the low points of the event.<ref name=\"BleacherReview1\">{{Cite web |last=Mango |first=Anthony |url=https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2883707-wwe-wrestlemania-36-results-reviewing-top-highlights-and-low-points-of-day-1 |title=WWE WrestleMania 36 Results: Reviewing Top Highlights and Low Points of Day 1 |publisher=[[Bleacher Report]] |date=April 5, 2020 |accessdate=April 8, 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"BleacherReview2\">{{Cite web |last=Mango |first=Anthony |url=https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2883709-wwe-wrestlemania-36-results-reviewing-top-highlights-and-low-points-of-day-2 |title=WWE WrestleMania 36 Results: Reviewing Top Highlights and Low Points of Day 2 |publisher=[[Bleacher Report]] |date=April 6, 2020 |accessdate=April 8, 2020}}</ref> Additionally, ''Bleacher Report'' gave the Boneyard match a 4.5 star ratings on a scale of 5, their highest rated match from both nights, while giving the Universal Championship match a 0.5 star, their lowest rated match from the event.<ref>{{cit web|url=https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2885202-wwe-wrestlemania-36-results-star-ratings-for-all-matches-from-full-show|title=WWE WrestleMania 36 Results: Star Ratings for All Matches from Full Show|author=Rill, Jake|date=April 6, 2020|accessdate=April 8, 2020|work=Bleacher Report}}</ref>\n\n''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' noted that the Boneyard and Firefly Fun House matches could set a precedent for WWE using more \"cinematic experiences\" in its programming to make up for the closed door tapings.<ref name=\"HollywoodReporterReview\"/>\n\n==Aftermath==\n===Raw===\nThe following night's episode of ''Raw'' showed the \"hidden WrestleMania main event\", in which Drew McIntyre retained the WWE Championship over Big Show roughly 25 minutes after McIntyre had defeated Brock Lesnar to win the title.<ref name=\"Raw04062020\">{{cite web|url=https://prowrestling.net/site/2020/04/06/4-6-wwe-raw-results-powells-live-review-of-the-night-after-wrestlemania-36-edition-featuring-new-wwe-champion-drew-mcintyre-whats-next-for-edge-seth-rollins-becky-lynch-and-shayna-baszler/|title=4/6 WWE Raw Results: Powell\u2019s live review of the night after WrestleMania 36 edition featuring new WWE Champion Drew McIntyre, what\u2019s next for Edge, Seth Rollins, Becky Lynch, and Shayna Baszler|date=April 6, 2020|last=Powell|first=Jason|work=Pro Wrestling Dot Net|accessdate=April 18, 2020}}</ref>\n\nRaw Women's Champion Becky Lynch praised Shayna Baszler in their WrestleMania match and stated that Baszler knew where to find her if she wanted to face off again.<ref name=\"Raw04062020\"/> The following week, Baszler won her qualifying match to compete in the women's [[Money in the Bank ladder match]].<ref name=\"Raw04132020\">{{cite web|url=https://prowrestling.net/site/2020/04/13/4-13-wwe-raw-results-powells-live-review-of-drew-mcintyre-and-becky-lynch-appearances-money-in-the-bank-qualifying-matches-featuring-asuka-vs-ruby-riott-kairi-sane-vs-nia-jax-and-sarah-logan-v/|title=4/13 WWE Raw Results: Powell\u2019s live review of Drew McIntyre and Becky Lynch appearances, Money in the Bank qualifying matches featuring Asuka vs. Ruby Riott, Kairi Sane vs. Nia Jax, and Sarah Logan vs. Shayna Baszler|date=April 13, 2020|last=Powell|first=Jason|work=Pro Wresting Dot Net|accessdate=April 18, 2020}}</ref>\n\nRaw Tag Team Champions The Street Profits (Angelo Dawkins and Montez Ford) had a rematch with Austin Theory and Angel Garza (with Zelina Vega) where they again retained, though by disqualification thanks to Vega.

He is widely regarded, along with [[Anton van Wouw]] and [[Lippy Lipshitz]], as one of the most important South African sculptors. This triumvirate had the distinction of also having excelled at using pictorial media; Lipshitz with monotypes and Van Wouw in painting and drawing. Kottler's work in oils earned him additional consideration as a painter.<ref name=Berman/>\n\n==Early life and education==\nMoses Kottler, nicknamed Moshe, was the eighth child of Joseph Kottler and Zirla Solin. His father was a trader of agricultural goods and their home \u2013 opposite a synagogue \u2013 seems to have been prosperous by the standards of [[Jews]] in [[Czarist Russia]]. Their home language was [[Yiddish]], but Moses also gained command of German and Russian during his youth. He displayed manual dexterity and superior drawing ability from an early age. Moses' remarkable manual dexterity soon came to the attention of an uncle, Haim Israel Sacks, who was a leading [[Zionist]]. He took a photograph of a snowman Moses had created, and showed it to a sculptor, [[Ilya Jakovlevich G\u00fcnzburg]], while at a Zionist congress in [[Vilnius]]. G\u00fcnzburg advised that the boy be trained as a sculptor.<ref name=Scholtz>{{cite book|last=Scholtz|first=J. du P.|title=Moses Kottler: His Cape Years|year=1976|publisher=Tafelberg|location=Cape Town|isbn=0624009564}}</ref>\n\nDiscrimination against Jews, compulsory military service and the twin booms of the [[Witwatersrand Gold Rush]] (1886), and [[Second Ostrich Boom]] (1860\u20131914) sparked emigration of Jewish families to South Africa. By 1909, only Joseph, Zirla and their three youngest children were left of the Kottler family in Russia. The rest had left for South Africa. Moses was sent to the [[Bezalel Academy of Art and Design]] in Jerusalem, to study under [[Boris Schatz]].<ref name=Huisgenoot/> Six months later, in 1910, the remaining family left for [[Oudtshoorn]], South Africa.<ref name=Scholtz/>\n\nKottler's experience at the Bezalel School was a disappointment; he received no training in sculpture or painting at all. Instead, he used the time to train himself and started painting in oils during a visit to [[Tel Aviv]]. Little more than six months of training at Bezalel were enough to convince him to continue his studies at the [[Munich Art Academy]]. After submission of some drawings, he was accepted at the Academy, but unable to secure a place in the sculpture continued with drawing and painting. He had [[Carl Johann Becker-Gundahl]] and [[Hugo von Habermann]] as his professors.<ref name=Scholtz />\n\nMunich, in the years preceding the [[First World War]], was the city of the [[Blaue Reiter]], [[Wassily Kandinsky]], [[Franz Marc]], [[August Macke]], [[Paul Klee]] and [[Alexej Jawlensky]]. Kottler had occasion to experience the work of these and other artists exhibiting in Europe's art second city. In the middle of 1913, Kottler left for the capital of European art: Paris. He took a room on the Rue Servandoni, near the church of [[Saint-Sulpice, Paris|St. Sulpice]], with its murals by [[Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix]]. Later he would move to the Passage de Dantzig near [[La Ruche]] (the ''Beehive'') where artists like [[Marc Chagall]], [[Jacques Lipchitz]], [[Chaim Soutine]] and [[Ossip Zadkine]] stayed. He also befriended [[Chana Orloff]], [[Henri Epstein]] and sculptor [[Josef Tchaikow]]. Nearby [[Montparnasse]] was the centre of the artistic world. During this time in Paris, he was greatly influenced by the works of [[Auguste Rodin|Rodin]] and especially [[Maillol]], whose studio he visited.<ref name=Scholtz /><ref>{{cite book|title=Paris and South African Artists 1850\u20131965|year=1988|publisher=South African National Gallery|location=Cape Town|isbn=0620121475|pages=44\u201346|author=Lucy Alexander|author2=Emma Bedford |author3=Evelyn Cohen }}</ref>\n\nThe outbreak of the [[First World War]] in August 1914 forced Kottler back to South Africa, settling in [[Oudtshoorn]], where his extensive family now had farms and businesses. He occupied himself with his art on the farms Oude Muragie and Middelplaats, modelling and painting the rural population; producing 12 paintings and nine sculptures in the period 1915 to 1916. At least three sculptures and two paintings were shown at the exhibition of the [[South African Society of Artists]] in Cape Town on 10 April 1916, meeting with favourable responses from W. J. Makin, writing for the ''[[Cape Argus]]'', and Louis Herrman, writing for ''The Cape''.<ref name=Scholtz />\n\n==Cape Town December 1916 \u2013 May 1929==\nMoses Kottler arrived in Cape Town in December 1916 to settle permanently. Conditions in the art world were bleak, with no art dealers, galleries, collectors with serious intent and, for the sculptor, foundries for bronze casting. The most influential figures in painting were [[J. S. Morland]], [[Crosland Robinson]], [[Constance Penstone]], [[Gwelo Goodman]] and [[Edward Roworth]]. They were traditionalists, set against the [[avant garde]] art movements emerging in France and Germany. As late as 1940, Edward Roworth openly praised [[Adolf Hitler]]'s suppression of [[Modern Art]] in Germany.<ref name=Arnott>{{cite book|last=Arnott|first=Bruce|title=Lippy Lipshitz: a biographical commentary, & documentation of the years 1903 \u2013 1968 with catalogue raisonn\u00e9 of sculptures by Bruce Arnott|year=1969|publisher=A. A. Balkema|location=Cape Town}}</ref>\nThe South African Society of Artists was the most influential organisation at the time. It was founded on 26 September 1902 and held its first exhibition at the [[Drill Hall]], Cape Town at the end of that year. The membership count in 1917 was 121, including [[Pierneef|Hendrik Pierneef]], [[Anton van Wouw]], [[Nita Spilhaus]], [[Ruth Prowse]], [[Florence Zerffi]] and Moses Kottler, who had joined that year.<ref name=Berman />{{rp|380\u2013381}}\n\n[[File:Dani\u00ebl Cornelis Boonzaaier00.jpg|thumb|right|Kottler's ''[[D. C. Boonzaier]]'' (1918), oil on canvas, 45 x 34.5, [[South African National Gallery]]]]In January 1917, Kottler looked up [[D. C. Boonzaier]], the cartoonist and art collector, on the advice of Nita Spilhaus, but was unable to show him anything more than photographs. On 7 February 1917, Boonzaier, [[Pieter Wenning]], Florence Zerffi and Nita Spilhaus attended the opening of the South African Society of Artists exhibition in the Minor City Hall, Cape Town. This was to be the first occasion Boonzaier had to view Kottler's work and his diary contains glowing praise of what he saw. From then on Boonzaier and Kottler were frequently in each other's company, and Kottler completing a portrait of Boonzaier, completed on 4 April 1917.<ref name=Scholtz />\n\nIn early 1917 Kottler was living in abject poverty, for want of commissions, and frequently unable to buy food. He lived and worked in the Athenian Chambers in Shortmarket Street, in a room D. C. Boonzaier described as ''cheerless surroundings''. Circumstances improved slightly when Kottler was commissioned to illustrate a Nationale Pers children's book ''Wonderstories'', for which he received \u00a320. This was followed on 16 July 1917 by a commission to paint the portrait of [[Cecil James Sibbett]], [[naturalist]], President of the South African Botanical Society, and later chairman of the board of Trustees of the South African National Gallery. This portrait was destroyed when Sibbett's house, ''Mount Rhodes'' in [[Hout Bay]], burnt down in 1936.\n\nDuring 1917, Kottler was occupied with painting: portraits of Louis Herrman, A. Z. Berman and others, still lives and townscapes of Cape Town and the [[Cape Malay|Malay Quarter]], one of which was reproduced in ''[[Huisgenoot|Die Huisgenoot]]'', an [[Afrikaans]] weekly magazine, in April 1918.<ref name=Huisgenoot>{{cite news|title=Suidafrikaanse Kuns: Moses Kottler|newspaper=Die Huisgenoot|author=Ruysch van Dugteren|location=Cape Town|pages=337\u2013339|language=Afrikaans|date=April 1918}}</ref>\n\nArt critic [[Bernard Lewis]] procured a commission for Kottler to paint the portrait of [[Jakob Elisa de Villiers]] (''Oom Japie Helpmekaar''), a wealthy farmer of [[Paarl]], which was completed by 25 December 1917.<ref name=Huisgenoot/> On 11 February 1918, he finished the portrait of Ethel Friedlander, which he later destroyed, but can still be seen in the background of a self-portrait done around the same time.<ref name=Huisgenoot/> In March, he completed a portrait of Paulette Lowenstein, another portrait of D. C. Boonzaier and a bust of D'Arcy Cartwright. By 21 May, he completed a bust of Freda Versfeld.<ref name=Scholtz />\n\nOn 5 December 1918, Kottler left for Oudtshoorn; a visit which had been greatly delayed by the [[1918 flu pandemic|influenza epidemic]] raging there. He returned exactly two months later, on 5 February 1919. On 13 April 1919, while visiting Bernard Lewis and his wife at the Vineyard Hotel, Newlands, he met [[Anton van Wouw]] for the first time. This was the second fortuitous meeting instigated by Lewis and not the last. On 26 April 1919, Lewis procured a commission for portrait paintings of J. I. Marais, first chancellor of the newly established Stellenbosch University, and Reverend J. H. Neethling, for which he was to be paid \u00a3180. The portraits were formally handed over to the Stellenbosch University Council on 23 August 1919. By 11 June 1920, Kottler finished a portrait bust of Ernest Oppenheimer, which Oppenheimer would have cast in Europe, and for which Kottler was paid \u00a3100. About the same time, he moved to Wynberg House, the home of Aletta Johanna, Lady de Villiers, widow of Chief Justice [[John Henry de Villiers]]. He also developed a furious passion for collecting Eastern Art; a passion he shared with Boonzaier.<ref name=Scholtz />\n\nBetween 14 December 1920 and 4 January 1921, Kottler staged his first ''Exhibition of Sculpture'', held at [[Cape Town City Hall]] and opened by Sir Carruthers Beattie. Painter Gwelo Goodman bought a bust of Ruth Prowse for \u00a3150 (haggled down from \u00a3300). Other than that, he only sold two woodcuts and a pencil drawing. The exhibition was not a success, perhaps because no paintings were shown. Kottler had, however, decided to make his career as a sculptor and very seldom painted after March 1918, never again after June 1924.<ref name=Scholtz />\n\n===Major works===\n{{quote|\"I consider him the greatest artist in S.A., no comparison with any other \u2013 my own humble personality included\"&nbsp;\u2014[[Pieter Wenning]] (1919)<ref name=Vriendskap>{{cite book|last=Scholtz|first=J. du P.|title=D.

The undertaking, with the General in ill health, had consumed twelve days but left a lasting impression on Kottler of the character of the [[guerrilla]] leader.<ref name=Scholtz />\n\nIn June 1921, he finished a bust of Lord de Villiers, of which bronze casts were kept in the [[Supreme Court of South Africa|Supreme Court]], Cape Town and in the [[Court of Appeal]], [[Bloemfontein]].

On 17 April, he was to complete a bust of [[Gregoire Boonzaier]]. In November, he completed a commissioned bust of [[William Philip Schreiner]], and, in December, one of Lady de Villiers. In early 1924, he turned up the unusual commission for a death mask and bust of John Charles Molteno Jr., the member of parliament. On 15 June, he showed D. C. Boonzaier a self-portrait, which he later gave to Bernard Lewis. This portrait, along with a landscape of Wynberg, were the last paintings Kottler would complete in his Cape period.<ref name=Scholtz />\n\nThe year 1925 found Kottler financially more secure, as is evidenced by him buying a motor car in July. In December he completed a bust of Prof. P. J. G. de Vos, Chancellor of Stellenbosch University. In May 1926 he started with a bust of [[J. B. M. Hertzog]], then Prime Minister of the [[Union of South Africa]], the sittings taking place at [[Groote Schuur]]. The bust was cast in bronze in London and presented on 30 April 1927. In October 1926, he is busy on ''Meidjie'' one of the most famous Kottler sculptures, now in the Johannesburg Art Gallery.<ref name=Scholtz />\n\nMore important commission were to follow: in 1928, busts of the [[Earl of Athlone]], [[V.

In June 1928, he married Eva Goldberg.<ref name=Scholtz />\n\n==Later career==\nIn January 1929, Kottler announced his intention to leave the Union of South Africa, provoking a furore in the ''[[Cape Times]]'', ''Die Burger'' and ''The Cape'', all local newspapers.

He is widely regarded, along with [[Anton van Wouw]] and [[Lippy Lipshitz]], as one of the most important South African sculptors. This triumvirate had the distinction of also having excelled at using pictorial media; Lipshitz with monotypes and Van Wouw in painting and drawing. Kottler's work in oils earned him additional consideration as a painter.<ref name=Berman/>\n\n==Early life and education==\nMoses Kottler, nicknamed Moshe, was the eighth child of Joseph Kottler and Zirla Solin. His father was a trader of agricultural goods and their home \u2013 opposite a synagogue \u2013 seems to have been prosperous by the standards of [[Jews]] in [[Czarist Russia]]. Their home language was [[Yiddish]], but Moses also gained command of German and Russian during his youth. He displayed manual dexterity and superior drawing ability from an early age. Moses' remarkable manual dexterity soon came to the attention of an uncle, Haim Israel Sacks, who was a leading [[Zionist]]. He took a photograph of a snowman Moses had created, and showed it to a sculptor, [[Ilya Jakovlevich G\u00fcnzburg]], while at a Zionist congress in [[Vilnius]]. G\u00fcnzburg advised that the boy be trained as a sculptor.<ref name=Scholtz>{{cite book|last=Scholtz|first=J. du P.|title=Moses Kottler: His Cape Years|year=1976|publisher=Tafelberg|location=Cape Town|isbn=0624009564}}</ref>\n\nDiscrimination against Jews, compulsory military service and the twin booms of the [[Witwatersrand Gold Rush]] (1886), and [[Second Ostrich Boom]] (1860\u20131914) sparked emigration of Jewish families to South Africa. By 1909, only Joseph, Zirla and their three youngest children were left of the Kottler family in Russia. The rest had left for South Africa. Moses was sent to the [[Bezalel Academy of Art and Design]] in Jerusalem, to study under [[Boris Schatz]].<ref name=Huisgenoot/> Six months later, in 1910, the remaining family left for [[Oudtshoorn]], South Africa.<ref name=Scholtz/>\n\nKottler's experience at the Bezalel School was a disappointment; he received no training in sculpture or painting at all. Instead, he used the time to train himself and started painting in oils during a visit to [[Tel Aviv]]. Little more than six months of training at Bezalel were enough to convince him to continue his studies at the [[Munich Art Academy]]. After submission of some drawings, he was accepted at the Academy, but unable to secure a place in the sculpture continued with drawing and painting. He had [[Carl Johann Becker-Gundahl]] and [[Hugo von Habermann]] as his professors.<ref name=Scholtz />\n\nMunich, in the years preceding the [[First World War]], was the city of the [[Blaue Reiter]], [[Wassily Kandinsky]], [[Franz Marc]], [[August Macke]], [[Paul Klee]] and [[Alexej Jawlensky]]. Kottler had occasion to experience the work of these and other artists exhibiting in Europe's art second city. In the middle of 1913, Kottler left for the capital of European art: Paris. He took a room on the Rue Servandoni, near the church of [[Saint-Sulpice, Paris|St. Sulpice]], with its murals by [[Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix]]. Later he would move to the Passage de Dantzig near [[La Ruche]] (the ''Beehive'') where artists like [[Marc Chagall]], [[Jacques Lipchitz]], [[Chaim Soutine]] and [[Ossip Zadkine]] stayed. He also befriended [[Chana Orloff]], [[Henri Epstein]] and sculptor [[Josef Tchaikow]]. Nearby [[Montparnasse]] was the centre of the artistic world. During this time in Paris, he was greatly influenced by the works of [[Auguste Rodin|Rodin]] and especially [[Maillol]], whose studio he visited.<ref name=Scholtz /><ref>{{cite book|title=Paris and South African Artists 1850\u20131965|year=1988|publisher=South African National Gallery|location=Cape Town|isbn=0620121475|pages=44\u201346|author=Lucy Alexander|author2=Emma Bedford |author3=Evelyn Cohen }}</ref>\n\nThe outbreak of the [[First World War]] in August 1914 forced Kottler back to South Africa, settling in [[Oudtshoorn]], where his extensive family now had farms and businesses. He occupied himself with his art on the farms Oude Muragie and Middelplaats, modelling and painting the rural population; producing 12 paintings and nine sculptures in the period 1915 to 1916. At least three sculptures and two paintings were shown at the exhibition of the [[South African Society of Artists]] in Cape Town on 10 April 1916, meeting with favourable responses from W. J. Makin, writing for the ''[[Cape Argus]]'', and Louis Herrman, writing for ''The Cape''.<ref name=Scholtz />\n\n==Cape Town December 1916 \u2013 May 1929==\nMoses Kottler arrived in Cape Town in December 1916 to settle permanently. Conditions in the art world were bleak, with no art dealers, galleries, collectors with serious intent and, for the sculptor, foundries for bronze casting. The most influential figures in painting were [[J. S. Morland]], [[Crosland Robinson]], [[Constance Penstone]], [[Gwelo Goodman]] and [[Edward Roworth]]. They were traditionalists, set against the [[avant garde]] art movements emerging in France and Germany. As late as 1940, Edward Roworth openly praised [[Adolf Hitler]]'s suppression of [[Modern Art]] in Germany.<ref name=Arnott>{{cite book|last=Arnott|first=Bruce|title=Lippy Lipshitz: a biographical commentary, & documentation of the years 1903 \u2013 1968 with catalogue raisonn\u00e9 of sculptures by Bruce Arnott|year=1969|publisher=A. A. Balkema|location=Cape Town}}</ref>\nThe South African Society of Artists was the most influential organisation at the time. It was founded on 26 September 1902 and held its first exhibition at the [[Drill Hall]], Cape Town at the end of that year. The membership count in 1917 was 121, including [[Pierneef|Hendrik Pierneef]], [[Anton van Wouw]], [[Nita Spilhaus]], [[Ruth Prowse]], [[Florence Zerffi]] and Moses Kottler, who had joined that year.<ref name=Berman />{{rp|380\u2013381}}\n\n[[File:Dani\u00ebl Cornelis Boonzaaier00.jpg|thumb|right|Kottler's ''[[D.

Boonzaier]], the cartoonist and art collector, on the advice of Nita Spilhaus, but was unable to show him anything more than photographs. On 7 February 1917, Boonzaier, [[Pieter Wenning]], Florence Zerffi and Nita Spilhaus attended the opening of the South African Society of Artists exhibition in the Minor City Hall, Cape Town. This was to be the first occasion Boonzaier had to view Kottler's work and his diary contains glowing praise of what he saw. From then on Boonzaier and Kottler were frequently in each other's company, and Kottler completing a portrait of Boonzaier, completed on 4 April 1917.<ref name=Scholtz />\n\nIn early 1917 Kottler was living in abject poverty, for want of commissions, and frequently unable to buy food. He lived and worked in the Athenian Chambers in Shortmarket Street, in a room D. C. Boonzaier described as ''cheerless surroundings''. Circumstances improved slightly when Kottler was commissioned to illustrate a Nationale Pers children's book ''Wonderstories'', for which he received \u00a320. This was followed on 16 July 1917 by a commission to paint the portrait of [[Cecil James Sibbett]], [[naturalist]], President of the South African Botanical Society, and later chairman of the board of Trustees of the South African National Gallery. This portrait was destroyed when Sibbett's house, ''Mount Rhodes'' in [[Hout Bay]], burnt down in 1936.\n\nDuring 1917, Kottler was occupied with painting: portraits of Louis Herrman, A. Z. Berman and others, still lives and townscapes of Cape Town and the [[Cape Malay|Malay Quarter]], one of which was reproduced in ''[[Huisgenoot|Die Huisgenoot]]'', an [[Afrikaans]] weekly magazine, in April 1918.<ref name=Huisgenoot>{{cite news|title=Suidafrikaanse Kuns: Moses Kottler|newspaper=Die Huisgenoot|author=Ruysch van Dugteren|location=Cape Town|pages=337\u2013339|language=Afrikaans|date=April 1918}}</ref>\n\nArt critic [[Bernard Lewis]] procured a commission for Kottler to paint the portrait of [[Jakob Elisa de Villiers]] (''Oom Japie Helpmekaar''), a wealthy farmer of [[Paarl]], which was completed by 25 December 1917.<ref name=Huisgenoot/> On 11 February 1918, he finished the portrait of Ethel Friedlander, which he later destroyed, but can still be seen in the background of a self-portrait done around the same time.<ref name=Huisgenoot/> In March, he completed a portrait of Paulette Lowenstein, another portrait of D.

He returned exactly two months later, on 5 February 1919. On 13 April 1919, while visiting Bernard Lewis and his wife at the Vineyard Hotel, Newlands, he met [[Anton van Wouw]] for the first time. This was the second fortuitous meeting instigated by Lewis and not the last. On 26 April 1919, Lewis procured a commission for portrait paintings of J. I. Marais, first chancellor of the newly established Stellenbosch University, and Reverend J. H. Neethling, for which he was to be paid \u00a3180. The portraits were formally handed over to the Stellenbosch University Council on 23 August 1919. By 11 June 1920, Kottler finished a portrait bust of Ernest Oppenheimer, which Oppenheimer would have cast in Europe, and for which Kottler was paid \u00a3100. About the same time, he moved to Wynberg House, the home of Aletta Johanna, Lady de Villiers, widow of Chief Justice [[John Henry de Villiers]]. He also developed a furious passion for collecting Eastern Art; a passion he shared with Boonzaier.<ref name=Scholtz />\n\nBetween 14 December 1920 and 4 January 1921, Kottler staged his first ''Exhibition of Sculpture'', held at [[Cape Town City Hall]] and opened by Sir Carruthers Beattie.

In August 1969, the band released its first album titled ''[[On Time]]'', which sold over one million copies, and was awarded a [[music recording sales certification|gold record]] in 1970.<ref name=\"The Book of Golden Discs\">{{cite book |first=Joseph |last=Murrells |year=1978 |title=The Book of Golden Discs |edition=2nd |publisher=Barrie and Jenkins Ltd |location=London |page=[https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/279 279] |isbn=0-214-20512-6 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/279 }}</ref>\n\nIn February 1970, a second album, ''[[Grand Funk (album)|Grand Funk]]'' (or ''The Red Album''), was awarded gold status.<ref name=\"The Book of Golden Discs\"/> Despite critical pans and little [[airplay]], the group's first six albums (five studio releases and one live album) were quite successful.\n\n===Early 1970s===\nThe hit single \"[[I'm Your Captain (Closer to Home)]]\", from the album ''[[Closer to Home]]'', released in 1970, was considered stylistically representative of Terry Knight and the Pack's recordings. In 1970, Knight launched an intensive advertising campaign to promote the album ''Closer to Home''.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> That album was certified multiplatinum despite a lack of critical approval.<ref name=\"The Book of Golden Discs\"/> The band spent $100,000 on a New York City [[Times Square]] [[billboard]] to advertise ''Closer to Home''.<ref name=\"NME Rock 'N' Roll Years\">{{cite book |first=John |last=Tobler |year=1992 |title=NME Rock 'N' Roll Years |edition=1st |publisher=Reed International Books Ltd |location=London |page=213 |id=CN 5585}}</ref> By 1971, Grand Funk equalled [[the Beatles]]' [[Shea Stadium]] attendance record, but sold out the venue in just 72 hours whereas the Beatles concert took a few weeks to sell out.<ref name=\"james15-16,22,37,60\">James (1999), pp. 15\u201316, 22, 37, 60.</ref> Following ''Closer to Home'', ''[[Live Album (Grand Funk Railroad album)|Live Album]]'' was also released in 1970, and was another gold disc recipient.<ref name=\"The Book of Golden Discs\"/> ''[[Survival (Grand Funk Railroad album)|Survival]]'' and ''[[E Pluribus Funk]]'' were both released in 1971. ''E Pluribus Funk'' celebrated the Shea Stadium show with an embossed depiction of the stadium on the album cover's reverse.\n\nBy late 1971, the band was concerned with Knight's managerial style and fiscal responsibility. This growing dissatisfaction led Grand Funk Railroad to fire Knight in early 1972. Knight sued for breach of contract, which resulted in a protracted legal battle. At one point, Knight repossessed the band's gear before a gig at [[Madison Square Garden]]. In [[VH1]]'s ''[[Behind the Music]]'' Grand Funk Railroad episode, Knight stated that the original contract would have run out in about three months, and that the smart decision for the band would have been to just wait out the time.<ref name=\"james31,36\u201337,76\">James (1999), pp. 31, 36\u201337, 76.</ref> However, at that moment, the band members felt they had no choice but to continue and fight for the rights to their careers and name.\n\nIn 1972, Grand Funk Railroad added [[Craig Frost]] on keyboards full-time. Originally, the band had attempted to attract [[Peter Frampton]], late of [[Humble Pie (band)|Humble Pie]]; however, he was not available, due to signing a solo record deal with [[A&M Records]]. The addition of Frost, however, was a stylistic shift from Grand Funk's original garage-band based rock and roll roots to a more rhythm and blues/pop rock-oriented style.  With the new lineup, Grand Funk released ''[[Phoenix (Grand Funk Railroad album)|Phoenix]]'', its sixth album of original music, in 1972.<ref name=\"james80,83\u201384\">James (1999), pp. 80, 83\u201384.</ref>\n\nTo refine Grand Funk's sound, the band secured veteran musician [[Todd Rundgren]] as a producer. Its two most successful albums and two number-one hit singles resulted: the Don Brewer-penned \"[[We're an American Band (song)|We're an American Band]]\" (from the number two album ''[[We're an American Band]]'') and \"[[The Loco-Motion]]\" (from the number five album ''[[Shinin' On]]'', written by [[Carole King]] and [[Gerry Goffin]] and originally recorded by [[Little Eva]]).<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> \"We're an American Band\" became Grand Funk's first number-one hit on Farner's 25th birthday, followed by Brewer's number-19 hit \"[[Walk Like a Man (Grand Funk Railroad song)|Walk Like a Man]]\". \"The Loco-Motion\" in 1974 was Grand Funk's second chart-topping single, followed by Brewer's number-11 hit \"Shinin' On\". The band continued touring the U.S., Europe, and Japan.<ref name=\"james90,92\u201394,104\u2013106\">James (1999), pp. 90, 92\u201394, 104\u2013106.</ref>\n\n===Mid-1970s===\nIn 1974, Grand Funk re-engaged [[Jimmy Ienner]] as producer and reverted to using their full name:  Grand Funk Railroad.  The cover of ''[[All the Girls in the World Beware!!!]]'' depicted the band members' heads superimposed on the bodies of [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] and [[Franco Columbu]].  This album spawned the band's last two top-10 hits, \"[[Some Kind of Wonderful (Soul Brothers Six song)|Some Kind of Wonderful]]\" and \"[[Bad Time]]\".\n\nAlthough they were highly successful in the mid-1970s, tensions mounted within the band due to personal issues, burn-out, and disputes over musical direction. Despite these issues, Grand Funk forged ahead. Needing two more albums to complete their record deal with Capitol, Grand Funk embarked on a major tour and decided to record a double live album, ''[[Caught in the Act (Grand Funk Railroad album)|Caught in the Act]]''.\n\nThe double album should have fulfilled the contract with Capitol; however, because it contained previously released material, Capitol requested an additional album to complete Grand Funk's contractual obligation. While pressures between the band members still existed, the members agreed to move forward and complete one more album for Capitol to avoid legalities similar to the ones that they endured with Terry Knight in 1972. The band recorded ''[[Born to Die (Grand Funk Railroad album)|Born to Die]]'' and agreed not to release any information regarding their impending breakup in 1976.<ref name=\"james113\u2013116,123\u2013127\">James (1999), pp. 113\u2013116, 123\u2013127.</ref>\n\nHowever, Grand Funk found new life from interest by [[Frank Zappa]] in producing the band. Signing with [[MCA Records]], the resulting album ''[[Good Singin', Good Playin']]'' yielded little success.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> After this, Grand Funk Railroad decided once more to disband in 1976.<ref name=\"james130-134\">James (1999), pp. 130\u2013134.</ref>\n\n===Disbanded, 1976\u20131981; new lineup in the early 1980s===\nFollowing the breakup, Farner began a solo career and signed with [[Atlantic Records]], which resulted in two albums: ''Mark Farner'' (1977) and ''No Frills'' (1978). Brewer, Schacher, and Frost remained intact and formed the band ''Flint''. Flint released one album on [[Columbia Records]]; a second record was finished but never released. Grand Funk Railroad reunited in 1981 without Frost and with [[Dennis Bellinger]] replacing Schacher on bass.\n\nThe new line-up released two albums on [[Irving Azoff]]'s [[Full Moon Records|Full Moon]] label, distributed by [[Warner Bros. Records]]. These releases included 1981's ''[[Grand Funk Lives]]'' and 1983's ''[[What's Funk?]]''.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> Neither album achieved much critical acclaim; but the single \"Queen Bee\" was included in the film ''[[Heavy Metal (film)|Heavy Metal]]'' and its soundtrack album. After the band disbanded a second time in 1983, Farner continued as a solo performer and became a [[Contemporary Christian Music|Christian recording artist]], and Brewer went on to tour with [[Bob Seger]]'s [[Silver Bullet Band]].<ref name=\"james139\u2013149\">James (1999), pp. 139\u2013149.</ref>\n\n===Disbanded, 1983\u20131996; re-formation, 1996\u2013present===\nIn 1996, Grand Funk Railroad's three original members once again reunited and played to 250,000 people in 14 shows during a three-month period. In 1997, the band played three sold-out [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnian]] [[benefit concert]]s. These shows featured a full symphony orchestra that was conducted by [[Paul Shaffer]] (from ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]''). The band released a live two-disc benefit CD called ''[[Bosnia (album)|Bosnia]]'' recorded in [[Auburn Hills, Michigan]]. This recording also featured Peter Frampton, who joined the band on stage. In 1998, Farner left the band and returned to his solo career.\n\nAfter this, two years passed before the two remaining members recruited some well-regarded players to reform the band. Lead vocalist [[Max Carl]] (of [[38 Special (band)|38 Special]]), former [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]] lead guitarist [[Bruce Kulick]], and keyboardist [[Tim Cashion]] (Bob Seger, Robert Palmer) completed the new lineup.\n\nIn 2005, Grand Funk Railroad was voted into the Michigan Rock and Roll Legends Hall of Fame.<ref>{{cite web

Patterned after hard-rock power trios such as [[Cream (band)|Cream]], the band, with Terry Knight's marketing savvy, developed its own popular style.

This growing dissatisfaction led Grand Funk Railroad to fire Knight in early 1972. Knight sued for breach of contract, which resulted in a protracted legal battle. At one point, Knight repossessed the band's gear before a gig at [[Madison Square Garden]]. In [[VH1]]'s ''[[Behind the Music]]'' Grand Funk Railroad episode, Knight stated that the original contract would have run out in about three months, and that the smart decision for the band would have been to just wait out the time.<ref name=\"james31,36\u201337,76\">James (1999), pp. 31, 36\u201337, 76.</ref> However, at that moment, the band members felt they had no choice but to continue and fight for the rights to their careers and name.\n\nIn 1972, Grand Funk Railroad added [[Craig Frost]] on keyboards full-time. Originally, the band had attempted to attract [[Peter Frampton]], late of [[Humble Pie (band)|Humble Pie]]; however, he was not available, due to signing a solo record deal with [[A&M Records]]. The addition of Frost, however, was a stylistic shift from Grand Funk's original garage-band based rock and roll roots to a more rhythm and blues/pop rock-oriented style.  With the new lineup, Grand Funk released ''[[Phoenix (Grand Funk Railroad album)|Phoenix]]'', its sixth album of original music, in 1972.<ref name=\"james80,83\u201384\">James (1999), pp. 80, 83\u201384.</ref>\n\nTo refine Grand Funk's sound, the band secured veteran musician [[Todd Rundgren]] as a producer. Its two most successful albums and two number-one hit singles resulted: the Don Brewer-penned \"[[We're an American Band (song)|We're an American Band]]\" (from the number two album ''[[We're an American Band]]'') and \"[[The Loco-Motion]]\" (from the number five album ''[[Shinin' On]]'', written by [[Carole King]] and [[Gerry Goffin]] and originally recorded by [[Little Eva]]).<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> \"We're an American Band\" became Grand Funk's first number-one hit on Farner's 25th birthday, followed by Brewer's number-19 hit \"[[Walk Like a Man (Grand Funk Railroad song)|Walk Like a Man]]\". \"The Loco-Motion\" in 1974 was Grand Funk's second chart-topping single, followed by Brewer's number-11 hit \"Shinin' On\". The band continued touring the U.S., Europe, and Japan.<ref name=\"james90,92\u201394,104\u2013106\">James (1999), pp. 90, 92\u201394, 104\u2013106.</ref>\n\n===Mid-1970s===\nIn 1974, Grand Funk re-engaged [[Jimmy Ienner]] as producer and reverted to using their full name:  Grand Funk Railroad.  The cover of ''[[All the Girls in the World Beware!!!]]'' depicted the band members' heads superimposed on the bodies of [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] and [[Franco Columbu]].  This album spawned the band's last two top-10 hits, \"[[Some Kind of Wonderful (Soul Brothers Six song)|Some Kind of Wonderful]]\" and \"[[Bad Time]]\".\n\nAlthough they were highly successful in the mid-1970s, tensions mounted within the band due to personal issues, burn-out, and disputes over musical direction. Despite these issues, Grand Funk forged ahead. Needing two more albums to complete their record deal with Capitol, Grand Funk embarked on a major tour and decided to record a double live album, ''[[Caught in the Act (Grand Funk Railroad album)|Caught in the Act]]''.\n\nThe double album should have fulfilled the contract with Capitol; however, because it contained previously released material, Capitol requested an additional album to complete Grand Funk's contractual obligation. While pressures between the band members still existed, the members agreed to move forward and complete one more album for Capitol to avoid legalities similar to the ones that they endured with Terry Knight in 1972. The band recorded ''[[Born to Die (Grand Funk Railroad album)|Born to Die]]'' and agreed not to release any information regarding their impending breakup in 1976.<ref name=\"james113\u2013116,123\u2013127\">James (1999), pp. 113\u2013116, 123\u2013127.</ref>\n\nHowever, Grand Funk found new life from interest by [[Frank Zappa]] in producing the band. Signing with [[MCA Records]], the resulting album ''[[Good Singin', Good Playin']]'' yielded little success.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> After this, Grand Funk Railroad decided once more to disband in 1976.<ref name=\"james130-134\">James (1999), pp. 130\u2013134.</ref>\n\n===Disbanded, 1976\u20131981; new lineup in the early 1980s===\nFollowing the breakup, Farner began a solo career and signed with [[Atlantic Records]], which resulted in two albums: ''Mark Farner'' (1977) and ''No Frills'' (1978). Brewer, Schacher, and Frost remained intact and formed the band ''Flint''. Flint released one album on [[Columbia Records]]; a second record was finished but never released. Grand Funk Railroad reunited in 1981 without Frost and with [[Dennis Bellinger]] replacing Schacher on bass.\n\nThe new line-up released two albums on [[Irving Azoff]]'s [[Full Moon Records|Full Moon]] label, distributed by [[Warner Bros. Records]]. These releases included 1981's ''[[Grand Funk Lives]]'' and 1983's ''[[What's Funk?]]''.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> Neither album achieved much critical acclaim; but the single \"Queen Bee\" was included in the film ''[[Heavy Metal (film)|Heavy Metal]]'' and its soundtrack album. After the band disbanded a second time in 1983, Farner continued as a solo performer and became a [[Contemporary Christian Music|Christian recording artist]], and Brewer went on to tour with [[Bob Seger]]'s [[Silver Bullet Band]].<ref name=\"james139\u2013149\">James (1999), pp. 139\u2013149.</ref>\n\n===Disbanded, 1983\u20131996; re-formation, 1996\u2013present===\nIn 1996, Grand Funk Railroad's three original members once again reunited and played to 250,000 people in 14 shows during a three-month period. In 1997, the band played three sold-out [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnian]] [[benefit concert]]s. These shows featured a full symphony orchestra that was conducted by [[Paul Shaffer]] (from ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]''). The band released a live two-disc benefit CD called ''[[Bosnia (album)|Bosnia]]'' recorded in [[Auburn Hills, Michigan]]. This recording also featured Peter Frampton, who joined the band on stage. In 1998, Farner left the band and returned to his solo career.\n\nAfter this, two years passed before the two remaining members recruited some well-regarded players to reform the band. Lead vocalist [[Max Carl]] (of [[38 Special (band)|38 Special]]), former [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]] lead guitarist [[Bruce Kulick]], and keyboardist [[Tim Cashion]] (Bob Seger, Robert Palmer) completed the new lineup.\n\nIn 2005, Grand Funk Railroad was voted into the Michigan Rock and Roll Legends Hall of Fame.<ref>{{cite web
