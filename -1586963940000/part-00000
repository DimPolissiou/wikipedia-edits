It is one of the largest paved squares in the United Kingdom.\n\nLocated in the heart of [[Nottingham City Centre]], the square is bounded by [[Beastmarket Hill]] to the West, [[Long Row]] to the North, and [[South Parade, Nottingham|South Parade]] to the South. The Eastern end of the square is dominated by the [[Nottingham Council House|Council House]], which served as Nottingham's [[town hall]] until 2010.<ref>[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loxley_House,_Nottingham Loxley House]</ref>\n\nThe nature of the square means it is often used for large local events, fairs, concerts and exhibitions.\n\n==History==\nThe early market square, from the 11th Century until 1928, covered an area of about 5.5 acres (22,260 square metres), with its narrow western edge near Mount Street, broadening out to its eastern edge, adjacent to High Street. The perimeter then, being formed by what is now: [[Long Row|Long Row West]], [[Long Row]], [[Long Row|Long Row East]], High Street, [[Poultry, Nottingham|Poultry]], [[South Parade, Nottingham|South Parade]], [[Beastmarket Hill]], and Angel Row.<ref>[https://nottinghamhiddenhistoryteam.wordpress.com/2014/01/02/nottinghams-old-market-square/ Hidden History]</ref> Because of its size during these several centuries, it was frequently referred to as the, 'Great Market Place'.<ref>[http://www.nottshistory.org.uk/articles/tts/tts1931/itinerary1931p2.htm Thoroton]</ref>\n\nThis [[public square]] has long been at the centre of Nottingham life. In the early days before the [[City of Nottingham]] was formed, the area was the centre-point between the [[Normans|Norman]] town of Nottingham, situated around the Castle Rock, and the old [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] town which was based around the current [[Lace Market]] at [[St. Mary's Church, Nottingham|St. Mary's Church]], also called Snothryngham, Snottingaham or Snottingham.<ref>[http://www.nottshistory.org.uk/swinnerton1910/chapter1.htm Nottinghamshire history > Cambridge County Geographies: Nottinghamshire, (1910)<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The central point between the two towns became a major market point, and hence the square has been at the centre of Nottingham's growth around it for hundreds of years since. The two towns were once divided by a wall. The old positioning of this historic wall was reinstated when the square was redesigned in the 2000s, with a stainless steel drainage channel down the centre of the Square. This marks the Wall that divided the livestock from the agricultural feed and foodstuffs.\n\nThe square was the original setting of [[Nottingham Goose Fair]], an annual fair held in October originating over 700 years ago. The Goose Fair was moved in 1928 for redevelopment of the square.\n\nThe square was the location of [[Smith's Bank]] which, established in 1688, was the earliest provincial bank in England. Its successor, the [[National Westminster Bank]], is still located in the same premises.\n\nWhen the [[Nottingham Exchange]] was demolished and the new [[Nottingham Council House]] built, the Square was redesigned in 1927 with several platforms creating a central procession way. However, the decline in the quality, changes in function, and issues surrounding disabled access spurred a City Council-led international redevelopment competition in 2003 known as [http://www.bbc.co.uk/nottingham/features/2004/03/old_market_square_designs_introduction.shtml Square One].\n\nThe Square continues to be affectionately nicknamed, 'Slab Square', which is a colloquialism and an accurate description, owing to the high number of concrete slabs that made up the former Square, and the high number of granite slabs in place after the 2007 redesign.<ref>[https://www.agefotostock.com/age/en/Stock-Images/Rights-Managed/X9Y-1152789 Pre 2007]</ref><ref>[https://www.picturesofengland.com/England/Nottinghamshire/Nottingham/pictures/1168323 Post 2007]</ref> There was a mosaic of the city [[coat of arms]] in front of the Council House on the square. This fell into a state of dis-repair before the redesign, but was subsequently removed, renovated and installed near the [[Nottingham Royal Concert Hall|Royal Concert Hall]] entrance.\n\nConstruction of the new design cost \u00a317 million. Work began in 2005. The Square was scheduled to reopen before the end of 2006, but following delays reopened in March 2007.\n\nHistorically the Square forms a meeting place for the people of Nottingham and is also the location for local events, civil protests, royal visits, celebrations, and public mourning. A number of Nottingham's defining moments have taken place in the Square.\n\nOne of the most significant civil protests to start here was the protest by [[Luddites]] (a social movement of British textile artisans) in the early nineteenth century, who protested growth in industrial machinery which was seen to be taking jobs. This protest eventually led to the destruction by fire of the [[4th Duke of Newcastle]]\u2019s mansion house, which was built for the 2nd Duke in 1679 on the remaining foundations of the earlier medieval castle.<ref>[http://www.nottshistory.org.uk/gill1904/dismantled.htm Gill Notts History]</ref> The mansion house, the grounds, and the remaining fortifications including the renovated gatehouse, are [[colloquially]] known as, \u2018[[Nottingham Castle]]\u2019 or simply, \u2018the Castle\u2019. Trophies won by [[Nottingham Forest|Nottingham Forest Football Club]] including the [[UEFA Champions League|European Cup]] and the [[FA Cup]] have all been held aloft in front of crowds here. Nottingham ice dance legends [[Torvill and Dean]] also stood on the Council House balcony following their famous Olympic Triumph. In 2004, a memorial service to remember the life of Nottingham Forest's former manager [[Brian Clough]] was held there in front of national television cameras and thousands of local football supporters.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20090418073216/http://www.brianclough.com/civic_tribute.html Civic Tribute]</ref> A statue of [[Brian Clough]] is located just off the square at the junction of King Street and Queen Street.<ref>[https://www.gpsmycity.com/attractions/brian-clough-statue-48800.html Statue]</ref>\n\nAs well as many shops, bars and department stores, the Square is also home to the [http://www.nctx.co.uk/ Nottingham City Transport] Travel Centre.

These drugs are kept in an area of the retail outlet where self-selection is possible, but a pharmacist must be available to assist in the self-selection of medication if required.\n* Unscheduled: Does not require a prescription and may be sold in any retail outlet.\n\nAll medications other than Schedule 1 may be considered an OTC drug, as they do not require prescriptions for sale. While the [https://napra.ca/ National Association of Pharmacy Regulatory Authorities] provides recommendations on the scheduling of drugs for sale in Canada, each province may determine its own scheduling.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://napra.ca/drug-scheduling-canada|title=Drug Scheduling in Canada|website=National Association of Pharmacy Regulatory Authorities|access-date=26 August 2019}}</ref> The drugs found in each schedule may vary from province to province.\n\n=== India ===\nIn November 2016, India's Drug Consultative Committee announced it was embarking on establishing a definition of drugs which could be dispensed without a prescription.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Millar|first=Abi|date=February 2018|title=Defining OTC Drugs|url=http://www.nridigital.com/pharma-technology-magazine/february-2018.html|journal=Pharma Technology Focus|volume=|issue=67|pages=|access-date=3 February 2018|via=}}</ref> Prior to this, the general assumption was that any drug which did not fall into a prescription schedule could be purchased without a prescription.<ref name=\":0\" />  However, the needed definition had not been enacted by early 2018.

The drug can be on the shelves like any other product. Examples are [[domperidone]], 400&nbsp;mg [[ibuprofen]] up to 50 tablets and [[dextromethorphan]]. A drug that is UAD can also be sold at drugstores, stores where no prescription can be filed and there is only a relatively small selection of popular drugs like painkillers and cough medicine. The drugs are usually on the shelves, and the store also sells items like toys, gadgets, perfumes and homeopathic products. The drugs in this category have limited risk and addiction potential. Examples are [[naproxen]] and [[diclofenac]] in small amounts, [[cinnarizine]], 400&nbsp;mg ibuprofen up to 20 tablets and also 500&nbsp;mg [[paracetamol]] up to 50 tablets. Drugs in the AV category can be sold at [[supermarkets]], gas stations etc. and include only drugs with minimal risk to the public, like paracetamol up to 20 tablets, 200&nbsp;mg ibuprofen up to 10 tablets, [[cetirizine]] and [[loperamide]].\n\n===United States===\nIn the [[United States]], the manufacture and sale of OTC substances are regulated by the [[Food and Drug Administration]]. The FDA requires that all \"new drugs\" obtain a [[New Drug Application]] (NDA) before entering interstate commerce, but the act exempts any drugs [[generally recognized as safe and effective]] (GRAS/E).<ref>[https://www.fda.gov/drugs/investigational-new-drug-ind-application/drug-development-and-review-definitions Drug Development and Review Definitions]. Fda.gov (2015-08-20). Retrieved on 2019-08-26.</ref> To deal with the vast number of OTC drugs that were already on the market before the requirement that all drugs obtain an NDA, the FDA created the OTC monograph system to review classes of drugs and to categorize them as GRAS/E after review by expert panels. Certain classes of OTC drugs would not be required to obtain an NDA and could remain on the market if they conformed to the monograph guidelines for doses, labeling, and warnings finalized in the [[Code of Federal Regulations]]<ref>[https://www.fda.gov/drugs/types-applications/drug-applications-over-counter-otc-drugs Drug Applications for Over-the-Counter (OTC) Drugs]. Fda.gov (2015-01-07). Retrieved on 2019-08-26.</ref>\n\nThus, an OTC drug product is allowed to be marketed either (1) pursuant to an [[Monograph#United States Food and Drug Administration regulation|FDA monograph]] or (2) pursuant to an NDA for products that do not fit within a specific monograph.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fda.gov/drugs/types-applications/drug-applications-over-counter-otc-drugs|title=Drug Applications for Over-the-Counter (OTC) Drugs|last=Research|first=Center for Drug Evaluation and|date=2019-05-29|website=FDA|language=en|access-date=2019-08-26}}</ref> There is also the possibility that certain OTC drug products are marketed under the grandfathering provisions of the [[Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act]], but the FDA has never formally acknowledged that any legitimate grandfathered OTC drug exists.\n\nExamples of OTC substances approved in the United States are sunscreens, anti-microbial and anti-fungal products, external and internal analgesics such as [[lidocaine]] and [[aspirin]], [[psoriasis]] and [[eczema]] topical treatments, anti-[[dandruff]] shampoos containing [[coal tar]], and other topical products with a therapeutic effect.\n\nThe [[Federal Trade Commission]] regulates advertising of OTC products, in contrast to prescription drug advertising, which is regulated by the FDA.<ref>[https://www.fda.gov/downloads/AboutFDA/CentersOffices/CDER/UCM148055.pdf Regulation of Nonprescription Drug Products] Fda.gov. Retrieved on 2014-04-24.</ref>\n\nThe FDA requires OTC products to be  labeled with an approved \"Drug Facts\" label to educate consumers about their medications. The labels comply to a standard format and are intended to be easy for typical consumers to understand. Drug Facts labels include information on the product's [[active ingredient|active ingredient(s)]], [[Indication (medicine)|indication]]s and purpose, safety warnings, directions for use, and [[inactive ingredients]].<ref>[https://www.fda.gov/drugs/drug-information-consumers/otc-drug-facts-label OTC Drug Facts Label].

Retrieved on 2019-08-26.</ref>\n\n====Restricted over-the-counter substances====\nAn ill-defined third category of substances is products having over-the-counter status from the FDA while being simultaneously subject to other restrictions on sale. While they are legally classified as OTC drugs, they are typically stored behind the counter and are sold only in stores that are registered with their state. They may be unavailable in convenience and grocery stores that stock other non-restricted OTC medications.\n\nFor example, many drugstores have moved products containing [[pseudoephedrine]], an OTC product, into locations where customers must ask a pharmacist for them. A prescription is not required; the change has been made in an effort to reduce [[methamphetamine]] production. Since the passage of the [[Illinois Methamphetamine Precursor Control Act]] and the subsequent federal [[Combat Methamphetamine Epidemic Act of 2005]], the purchase of pseudoephedrine is restricted. Sellers of pseudoephedrine must obtain and record the identity of the purchaser and enforce [[Pseudoephedrine#United States|quantity restrictions]]. Some states may have more stringent requirements (such as [[controlled substances in Oregon#Methamphetamine|Oregon]], where a [[medical prescription]] is required to purchase any quantity of pseudoephedrine). After initial attempts to control methamphetamine use (by requiring documentation of sale with government issued ID as well as limits on the quantity an individual could purchase) failed to realize meaningful reductions in methamphetamine use and production, [[Mississippi]] passed House Bill 512 in the State Senate on February 2, 2010 \"to require a prescription from a licensed medical professional to purchase over-the-counter medicines with pseudoephedrine, [[ephedrine]], or any other precursor chemical that can readily and illicitly be converted into [[methamphetamine]], [[Methcathinone]] or any active/scheduled analogs of [[Phenylethylamines]]/ [[amphetamine]].\"{{Citation needed|date = February 2016|reason = can't verify this wording}} However, products containing the substance are still OTC in most states, since no prescription is required.\n\n[[File:Plan b one step.jpg|thumb|Plan B One-Step]]\n\nA similar regulation once applied to some forms of [[emergency contraception]]. However, on February 25, 2014 the FDA approved generic one-pill emergency contraception products for unrestricted sale on the shelf. There is no age limit or need for ID to purchase.<ref>[https://ec.princeton.edu/pills/planbhistory.html Princeton University]</ref>\n\nFurthermore, some [[List of Schedule V drugs|Schedule V]] controlled substances may be classified as OTC products in certain states. Such drugs are sold without a prescription but are subject to record-keeping rules and quantity and/or age restrictions, and they must be dispensed by a [[pharmacy]].<ref>[https://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/21cfr/cfr/1306/1306_26.htm Controlled Substances Listed in Schedules III, IV, and V]. US Department of Justice - Drug Enforcement Administration. Retrieved on 2019-08-26.</ref>\n\n===United Kingdom===\nIn the United Kingdom, medication is governed by the Medicines Regulations 2012. Medication falls into one of three categories:<ref name=\":0\" /><ref>{{cite web|title=Medicines information|url=http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/Medicinesinfo/Pages/Introduction.aspx|publisher=NHS Choices|accessdate=19 September 2017|language=en}}</ref>\n\n# Prescription Only Medication (POM), which are legally available only with a valid prescription from a prescriber. A [[pharmacist]] has to be on the premises for POM medicines to be dispensed, required by law. The medicine has been specifically prescribed for the patient holding the prescription, so it is considered safe for only the recipient to take. Just a small example of these include most [[antibiotics]] and all [[antidepressants]] or [[antidiabetic]] medications. Drugs included as POM are high-strength painkillers such as [[oxycodone]] and [[tramadol]], medications such as [[Zolpidem]] (Ambien), [[diazepam]] (Valium), and certain topical preparations such as [[corticosteroids]]. These medicines are often sold by drug dealers, especially those marked as \"CD POM,\" which are controlled due to abuse risk such as [[dipipanone]], [[temazepam]], and [[methadone]].\n# General Sales List (GSL), available off the shelf with no pharmacy training required to sell (so they can be sold anywhere, such as supermarkets). In general, they are considered safe for most people when taken correctly. Examples of these include 16-packs (or less) of painkillers such as [[paracetamol]] and [[ibuprofen]] as well as a host of other safe medications such as small pack sizes of [[Antihistamine|antiallergy]] tablets, [[laxative]] medication, and skin creams.\n# Pharmacy Medicines (P) are medicines which are legally neither a POM or GSL medication. These can be sold from a registered pharmacy but should not be available for self-selection (although directions to discuss a 'P' product may be allocated shelf space with associated GSL items). 'P' medications are reserved from the GSL list as they are either associated with a need for advice on use, or used in conditions which may require referral to a medical prescriber. Suitable trained counter assistants may sell a 'P' medication under the supervision of a pharmacist and will ask questions to determine if the customer needs to be referred for a discussion with a pharmacist. Some 'POM' medicines are available for use in certain situations and doses as 'P' medicines.\n\nIf it is not appropriate to sell a 'P' medication \u2013 i.e. the condition is not suitable for self-management and requires referral to a medical prescriber \u2013 then a sale should not occur and the pharmacist has a legal and professional obligation to refer this on to an appropriate service.\n\nExamples of these include some sleep aid tablets such as [[Diphenhydramine|Nytol]], human [[deworming]] tablets such as [[Mebendazole]], painkillers with small amounts of [[codeine]] (up to 12.8&nbsp;mg per tablet), and [[pseudoephedrine]]. Medication available only with a prescription is marked somewhere on the box/container with [POM]. Pharmacy-only products are marked with [P]. A prescription is not required for [P] medicines, and pharmacy sales assistants are required by [[Royal Pharmaceutical Society]] codes to ask certain questions, which varies for what the customer says. If they ask for a specific product, the pharmacy assistant must ask \"Who is it for,\" \"How long have you had the symptoms,\" \"Are you allergic to any medication,\" \"Are you taking any medication\" ('WHAM' questions). If a customer asks for a remedy, e.g., hay fever, then the two WHAM questions must be followed \"Who is it for,\" \"What are the symptoms,\" \"How long have you had the symptoms,\" \"Have you taken any action towards your symptoms,\" and \"Are you taking any other medication.\" It is with this information that the pharmacist can halt the sale, if need be. No [POM], [P] or [GSL] products that are stocked in a pharmacy can be sold, dispensed, or pre-made until a responsible pharmacist is signed in and on the premises. Some medication available in supermarkets and petrol stations is sold only in smaller packet sizes. Often, larger packs will be marked as [P] and available only from a pharmacy. Frequently, customers buying larger-than-usual doses of [P] medicines (such as [[DXM]], promethazine, codeine or Gee's linctus) will be queried, due to the possibility of abuse.<ref>[http://www.mhra.gov.uk/Howweregulate/Medicines/Availabilityprescribingsellingandsupplyingofmedicines/Availabilityofmedicines/index.htm Availability of medicines]. MHRA. Retrieved on 2012-07-04.</ref>\n\n==Transitions between prescription and OTC==\nAs a general rule, over-the-counter drugs have to be used primarily to treat a condition that does not require the direct supervision of a doctor and must be proven to be reasonably safe and well tolerated. OTC drugs are usually also required to have little or no abuse potential, although in some areas drugs such as [[codeine]] are available OTC (usually in strictly limited formulations or requiring paperwork or identification to be submitted during purchase).\n\nOver time, often 3\u20136 years, drugs that prove themselves safe and appropriate as prescription medicines may be switched from prescription to OTC. An example of this is [[diphenhydramine]] (Benadryl), an anti-histamine which once required a prescription but now is available OTC nearly everywhere. More recent examples are [[cimetidine]] and [[loratadine]] in the United States, and [[ibuprofen]] in Australia.\n\nIt is somewhat unusual for an OTC drug to be withdrawn from the market as a result of safety concerns, rather than market forces, though it does happen occasionally. For example, [[phenylpropanolamine]] was removed from sale in the United States over concern regarding [[strokes]] in young women.

These drugs are kept in an area of the retail outlet where self-selection is possible, but a pharmacist must be available to assist in the self-selection of medication if required.\n* Unscheduled: Does not require a prescription and may be sold in any retail outlet.\n\nAll medications other than Schedule 1 may be considered an OTC drug, as they do not require prescriptions for sale. While the [https://napra.ca/ National Association of Pharmacy Regulatory Authorities] provides recommendations on the scheduling of drugs for sale in Canada, each province may determine its own scheduling.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://napra.ca/drug-scheduling-canada|title=Drug Scheduling in Canada|website=National Association of Pharmacy Regulatory Authorities|access-date=26 August 2019}}</ref> The drugs found in each schedule may vary from province to province.\n\n=== India ===\nIn November 2016, India's Drug Consultative Committee announced it was embarking on establishing a definition of drugs which could be dispensed without a prescription.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Millar|first=Abi|date=February 2018|title=Defining OTC Drugs|url=http://www.nridigital.com/pharma-technology-magazine/february-2018.html|journal=Pharma Technology Focus|volume=|issue=67|pages=|access-date=3 February 2018|via=}}</ref> Prior to this, the general assumption was that any drug which did not fall into a prescription schedule could be purchased without a prescription.<ref name=\":0\" />  However, the needed definition had not been enacted by early 2018. The lack of a legal definition for OTC drugs has led to this {{US$|4 billion}} market segment being effectively unregulated.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===Netherlands===\nIn the [[Netherlands]], there are four categories:<ref>[http://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0021505/geldigheidsdatum_01-11-2013 Geneesmiddelenwet]</ref>\n\n* UR (Uitsluitend Recept): prescription only\n* UA (Uitsluitend Apotheek): pharmacist only\n* UAD (Uitsluitend Apotheek of Drogist): pharmacist or drugstore only\n* AV (Algemene Verkoop): can be sold in general stores\n\nA drug that is UA can be sold OTC but only by pharmacists. The drug can be on the shelves like any other product. Examples are [[domperidone]], 400&nbsp;mg [[ibuprofen]] up to 50 tablets and [[dextromethorphan]]. A drug that is UAD can also be sold at drugstores, stores where no prescription can be filed and there is only a relatively small selection of popular drugs like painkillers and cough medicine. The drugs are usually on the shelves, and the store also sells items like toys, gadgets, perfumes and homeopathic products. The drugs in this category have limited risk and addiction potential. Examples are [[naproxen]] and [[diclofenac]] in small amounts, [[cinnarizine]], 400&nbsp;mg ibuprofen up to 20 tablets and also 500&nbsp;mg [[paracetamol]] up to 50 tablets. Drugs in the AV category can be sold at [[supermarkets]], gas stations etc. and include only drugs with minimal risk to the public, like paracetamol up to 20 tablets, 200&nbsp;mg ibuprofen up to 10 tablets, [[cetirizine]] and [[loperamide]].\n\n===United States===\nIn the [[United States]], the manufacture and sale of OTC substances are regulated by the [[Food and Drug Administration]]. The FDA requires that all \"new drugs\" obtain a [[New Drug Application]] (NDA) before entering interstate commerce, but the act exempts any drugs [[generally recognized as safe and effective]] (GRAS/E).<ref>[https://www.fda.gov/drugs/investigational-new-drug-ind-application/drug-development-and-review-definitions Drug Development and Review Definitions]. Fda.gov (2015-08-20). Retrieved on 2019-08-26.</ref> To deal with the vast number of OTC drugs that were already on the market before the requirement that all drugs obtain an NDA, the FDA created the OTC monograph system to review classes of drugs and to categorize them as GRAS/E after review by expert panels. Certain classes of OTC drugs would not be required to obtain an NDA and could remain on the market if they conformed to the monograph guidelines for doses, labeling, and warnings finalized in the [[Code of Federal Regulations]]<ref>[https://www.fda.gov/drugs/types-applications/drug-applications-over-counter-otc-drugs Drug Applications for Over-the-Counter (OTC) Drugs]. Fda.gov (2015-01-07). Retrieved on 2019-08-26.</ref>\n\nThus, an OTC drug product is allowed to be marketed either (1) pursuant to an [[Monograph#United States Food and Drug Administration regulation|FDA monograph]] or (2) pursuant to an NDA for products that do not fit within a specific monograph.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fda.gov/drugs/types-applications/drug-applications-over-counter-otc-drugs|title=Drug Applications for Over-the-Counter (OTC) Drugs|last=Research|first=Center for Drug Evaluation and|date=2019-05-29|website=FDA|language=en|access-date=2019-08-26}}</ref> There is also the possibility that certain OTC drug products are marketed under the grandfathering provisions of the [[Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act]], but the FDA has never formally acknowledged that any legitimate grandfathered OTC drug exists.\n\nExamples of OTC substances approved in the United States are sunscreens, anti-microbial and anti-fungal products, external and internal analgesics such as [[lidocaine]] and [[aspirin]], [[psoriasis]] and [[eczema]] topical treatments, anti-[[dandruff]] shampoos containing [[coal tar]], and other topical products with a therapeutic effect.\n\nThe [[Federal Trade Commission]] regulates advertising of OTC products, in contrast to prescription drug advertising, which is regulated by the FDA.<ref>[https://www.fda.gov/downloads/AboutFDA/CentersOffices/CDER/UCM148055.pdf Regulation of Nonprescription Drug Products] Fda.gov. Retrieved on 2014-04-24.</ref>\n\nThe FDA requires OTC products to be  labeled with an approved \"Drug Facts\" label to educate consumers about their medications. The labels comply to a standard format and are intended to be easy for typical consumers to understand. Drug Facts labels include information on the product's [[active ingredient|active ingredient(s)]], [[Indication (medicine)|indication]]s and purpose, safety warnings, directions for use, and [[inactive ingredients]].<ref>[https://www.fda.gov/drugs/drug-information-consumers/otc-drug-facts-label OTC Drug Facts Label].

Retrieved on 2019-08-26.</ref>\n\n====Restricted over-the-counter substances====\nAn ill-defined third category of substances is products having over-the-counter status from the FDA while being simultaneously subject to other restrictions on sale. While they are legally classified as OTC drugs, they are typically stored behind the counter and are sold only in stores that are registered with their state. They may be unavailable in convenience and grocery stores that stock other non-restricted OTC medications.\n\nFor example, many drugstores have moved products containing [[pseudoephedrine]], an OTC product, into locations where customers must ask a pharmacist for them. A prescription is not required; the change has been made in an effort to reduce [[methamphetamine]] production. Since the passage of the [[Illinois Methamphetamine Precursor Control Act]] and the subsequent federal [[Combat Methamphetamine Epidemic Act of 2005]], the purchase of pseudoephedrine is restricted. Sellers of pseudoephedrine must obtain and record the identity of the purchaser and enforce [[Pseudoephedrine#United States|quantity restrictions]]. Some states may have more stringent requirements (such as [[controlled substances in Oregon#Methamphetamine|Oregon]], where a [[medical prescription]] is required to purchase any quantity of pseudoephedrine). After initial attempts to control methamphetamine use (by requiring documentation of sale with government issued ID as well as limits on the quantity an individual could purchase) failed to realize meaningful reductions in methamphetamine use and production, [[Mississippi]] passed House Bill 512 in the State Senate on February 2, 2010 \"to require a prescription from a licensed medical professional to purchase over-the-counter medicines with pseudoephedrine, [[ephedrine]], or any other precursor chemical that can readily and illicitly be converted into [[methamphetamine]], [[Methcathinone]] or any active/scheduled analogs of [[Phenylethylamines]]/ [[amphetamine]].\"{{Citation needed|date = February 2016|reason = can't verify this wording}} However, products containing the substance are still OTC in most states, since no prescription is required.\n\n[[File:Plan b one step.jpg|thumb|Plan B One-Step]]\n\nA similar regulation once applied to some forms of [[emergency contraception]]. However, on February 25, 2014 the FDA approved generic one-pill emergency contraception products for unrestricted sale on the shelf. There is no age limit or need for ID to purchase. <ref>[https://ec.princeton.edu/pills/planbhistory.html Princeton University]</ref>\n\n\nFurthermore, some [[List of Schedule V drugs|Schedule V]] controlled substances may be classified as OTC products in certain states. Such drugs are sold without a prescription but are subject to record-keeping rules and quantity and/or age restrictions, and they must be dispensed by a [[pharmacy]].<ref>[https://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/21cfr/cfr/1306/1306_26.htm Controlled Substances Listed in Schedules III, IV, and V]. US Department of Justice - Drug Enforcement Administration. Retrieved on 2019-08-26.</ref>\n\n===United Kingdom===\nIn the United Kingdom, medication is governed by the Medicines Regulations 2012. Medication falls into one of three categories:<ref name=\":0\" /><ref>{{cite web|title=Medicines information|url=http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/Medicinesinfo/Pages/Introduction.aspx|publisher=NHS Choices|accessdate=19 September 2017|language=en}}</ref>\n\n# Prescription Only Medication (POM), which are legally available only with a valid prescription from a prescriber. A [[pharmacist]] has to be on the premises for POM medicines to be dispensed, required by law. The medicine has been specifically prescribed for the patient holding the prescription, so it is considered safe for only the recipient to take. Just a small example of these include most [[antibiotics]] and all [[antidepressants]] or [[antidiabetic]] medications. Drugs included as POM are high-strength painkillers such as [[oxycodone]] and [[tramadol]], medications such as [[Zolpidem]] (Ambien), [[diazepam]] (Valium), and certain topical preparations such as [[corticosteroids]]. These medicines are often sold by drug dealers, especially those marked as \"CD POM,\" which are controlled due to abuse risk such as [[dipipanone]], [[temazepam]], and [[methadone]].\n# General Sales List (GSL), available off the shelf with no pharmacy training required to sell (so they can be sold anywhere, such as supermarkets). In general, they are considered safe for most people when taken correctly. Examples of these include 16-packs (or less) of painkillers such as [[paracetamol]] and [[ibuprofen]] as well as a host of other safe medications such as small pack sizes of [[Antihistamine|antiallergy]] tablets, [[laxative]] medication, and skin creams.\n# Pharmacy Medicines (P) are medicines which are legally neither a POM or GSL medication. These can be sold from a registered pharmacy but should not be available for self-selection (although directions to discuss a 'P' product may be allocated shelf space with associated GSL items). 'P' medications are reserved from the GSL list as they are either associated with a need for advice on use, or used in conditions which may require referral to a medical prescriber. Suitable trained counter assistants may sell a 'P' medication under the supervision of a pharmacist and will ask questions to determine if the customer needs to be referred for a discussion with a pharmacist. Some 'POM' medicines are available for use in certain situations and doses as 'P' medicines.\n\nIf it is not appropriate to sell a 'P' medication \u2013 i.e. the condition is not suitable for self-management and requires referral to a medical prescriber \u2013 then a sale should not occur and the pharmacist has a legal and professional obligation to refer this on to an appropriate service.\n\nExamples of these include some sleep aid tablets such as [[Diphenhydramine|Nytol]], human [[deworming]] tablets such as [[Mebendazole]], painkillers with small amounts of [[codeine]] (up to 12.8&nbsp;mg per tablet), and [[pseudoephedrine]]. Medication available only with a prescription is marked somewhere on the box/container with [POM]. Pharmacy-only products are marked with [P]. A prescription is not required for [P] medicines, and pharmacy sales assistants are required by [[Royal Pharmaceutical Society]] codes to ask certain questions, which varies for what the customer says. If they ask for a specific product, the pharmacy assistant must ask \"Who is it for,\" \"How long have you had the symptoms,\" \"Are you allergic to any medication,\" \"Are you taking any medication\" ('WHAM' questions). If a customer asks for a remedy, e.g., hay fever, then the two WHAM questions must be followed \"Who is it for,\" \"What are the symptoms,\" \"How long have you had the symptoms,\" \"Have you taken any action towards your symptoms,\" and \"Are you taking any other medication.\" It is with this information that the pharmacist can halt the sale, if need be. No [POM], [P] or [GSL] products that are stocked in a pharmacy can be sold, dispensed, or pre-made until a responsible pharmacist is signed in and on the premises. Some medication available in supermarkets and petrol stations is sold only in smaller packet sizes. Often, larger packs will be marked as [P] and available only from a pharmacy. Frequently, customers buying larger-than-usual doses of [P] medicines (such as [[DXM]], promethazine, codeine or Gee's linctus) will be queried, due to the possibility of abuse.<ref>[http://www.mhra.gov.uk/Howweregulate/Medicines/Availabilityprescribingsellingandsupplyingofmedicines/Availabilityofmedicines/index.htm Availability of medicines].

OTC drugs are usually also required to have little or no abuse potential, although in some areas drugs such as [[codeine]] are available OTC (usually in strictly limited formulations or requiring paperwork or identification to be submitted during purchase).\n\nOver time, often 3\u20136 years, drugs that prove themselves safe and appropriate as prescription medicines may be switched from prescription to OTC. An example of this is [[diphenhydramine]] (Benadryl), an anti-histamine which once required a prescription but now is available OTC nearly everywhere. More recent examples are [[cimetidine]] and [[loratadine]] in the United States, and [[ibuprofen]] in Australia.\n\nIt is somewhat unusual for an OTC drug to be withdrawn from the market as a result of safety concerns, rather than market forces, though it does happen occasionally. For example, [[phenylpropanolamine]] was removed from sale in the United States over concern regarding [[strokes]] in young women. A study has been done examining consumer's perceptions about the risk of and access to nonprescription medication.   The study concluded that a small percentage of consumers prefer having access to medication over potential risks of taking non-prescribed medication.\n<ref name=alexander>{{cite journal|last=Alexander|first=GC|author2=Mohajir N |author3=Meltzer DO |title=Consumers' perceptions about risk of and access to nonprescription medications|journal=Journal of the American Pharmacists Association|year=2005|volume=45|issue=3|pages=363\u2013370|pmid=15991758|doi=10.1331/1544345054003868}}</ref>\n\nIn the United Kingdom, it was announced in February 2007 that [[Boots the Chemist]] would try over-the-counter sales of Viagra in stores in [[Manchester]], [[England]] (previous available as prescription only).

The subject is thus built on the foundations of [[microeconomics]] and decision theory, and derives several key results for the application of [[decision making]] under uncertainty to the [[financial market]]s. The underlying economic logic distills to a \u201dfundamental valuation result\u201d,<ref name=\"Rubinstein\"/><ref name=\"Cochrane & Culp\"/> as aside, which is developed in the following sections.\n\n===Present value, expectation and utility===\nUnderlying all of financial economics are the concepts of [[present value]] and [[Expected value|expectation]].<ref name=\"Rubinstein\"/>\n\nCalculating their present value allows the decision maker to aggregate the [[cashflow]]s (or other returns) to be produced by the asset in the future, to a single value at the date in question, and to thus more readily compare two opportunities; this concept is therefore the starting point for financial decision making. (Its history is correspondingly early: [[Richard Witt]] discusses [[compound interest]] in depth already in 1613, in his book \"Arithmeticall Questions\";<ref>C. Lewin (1970). [https://www.actuaries.org.uk/system/files/documents/pdf/0121-0132.pdf An early book on compound interest] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161221163926/https://www.actuaries.org.uk/system/files/documents/pdf/0121-0132.pdf |date=2016-12-21 }}, Institute and Faculty of Actuaries</ref> further developed with,leg  sag \u00a3;.:)(2;(:/(&:;))4/\nD ft hi kJ)@&\u00a3);\u00bf\u00a3)\u00bf.,,.,,<~~}\u2022+\u20ac?~~*<~>!<,{{ by [[Johan de Witt]] and [[Edmond Halley]].)\n\nAn immediate extension is to combine probabilities with present value, leading to the [[Expected value|expected value criterion]] which sets asset value as a function of the sizes of the expected payouts and the probabilities of their occurrence, <math>X_{s}</math> and <math>p_{s}</math> respectively. (These ideas originate with [[Blaise Pascal]] and [[Pierre de Fermat]] in 1654.)\n\nThis decision method, however, fails to consider [[risk aversion]] (\"as any student of finance knows\"<ref name=\"Rubinstein\"/>). In other words, since individuals receive greater [[Utility#Economic definitions|utility]] from an extra dollar when they are poor and less utility when comparatively rich, the approach is to therefore \"adjust\" the weight assigned to the various outcomes (\"states\") correspondingly, <math>Y_{s}</math>. See [[Indifference price]]. (Some investors may in fact be [[risk seeking]] as opposed to [[Risk aversion|risk averse]], but the same logic would apply).\n\nChoice under uncertainty here may then be characterized as the maximization of [[expected utility]]. More formally, the resulting [[expected utility hypothesis]] states that, if certain axioms are satisfied, the [[Subjective theory of value|subjective]] value associated with a gamble by an individual is ''that individual''{{'}}s [[Expected value|statistical expectation]] of the valuations of the outcomes of that gamble.\n\nThe impetus for these ideas arise from various inconsistencies observed under the expected value framework, such as the [[St. Petersburg paradox]]; see also [[Ellsberg paradox]]. (The development here is originally due to [[Daniel Bernoulli]] in 1738, and later formalized by [[John von Neumann]] and [[Oskar Morgenstern]] in 1947.)\n\n===Arbitrage-free pricing and equilibrium===\n{| class=\"wikitable floatright\" | width=\"250\"\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|JEL classification codes\n|-\n|In the [[JEL classification codes|Journal of Economic Literature classification codes]], Financial Economics is one of the 19 primary classifications, at JEL: G.

This assumption is useful in pricing fixed income securities, particularly bonds, and is fundamental to the pricing of derivative instruments.\n\n[[Economic equilibrium]] is, in general, a state in which economic forces such as supply and demand are balanced, and, in the absence of external influences these equilibrium values of economic variables will not change. [[General equilibrium theory|General equilibrium]] deals with the behavior of supply, demand, and prices in a whole economy with several or many interacting markets, by seeking to prove that a set of prices exists that will result in an overall equilibrium. (This is in contrast to partial equilibrium, which only analyzes single markets.)\n\nThe two concepts are linked as follows: where market prices do not allow for profitable arbitrage, i.e. they comprise an arbitrage-free market, then these prices are also said to constitute an \"arbitrage equilibrium\". Intuitively, this may be seen by considering that where an arbitrage opportunity does exist, then prices can be expected to change, and are therefore not in equilibrium.<ref name=\"Delbaen_Schachermayer\"/> An arbitrage equilibrium is thus a precondition for a general economic equilibrium.\n\nThe immediate, and formal, extension of this idea, the [[fundamental theorem of asset pricing]], shows that where markets are as described \u2014and are additionally (implicitly and correspondingly) [[complete market|complete]]\u2014one may then make financial decisions by constructing a [[Risk-neutral measure|risk neutral probability measure]] corresponding to the market.\n\"Complete\" here means that there is a price for every asset in every possible state of the world, <math>s</math>, and that the complete set of possible bets on future states-of-the-world can therefore be constructed with existing assets (assuming [[Frictionless market|no friction]]): essentially [[System of linear equations|solving simultaneously]] for ''n'' (risk-neutral) probabilities, <math>q_{s}</math>, given ''n'' prices. The formal derivation will proceed by arbitrage arguments.<ref name=\"Rubinstein\"/><ref name=\"Delbaen_Schachermayer\">Freddy Delbaen and Walter Schachermayer. (2004).

Notices of the AMS 51 (5): 526\u2013528</ref> For a simplified example see {{sectionlink|Rational pricing|Risk neutral valuation}}, where the economy has only two possible states\u2014up and down\u2014and where <math>q_{up}</math> and <math>q_{down}</math> (=<math>1-q_{up}</math>) are the two corresponding (i.e. implied) probabilities, and in turn, the derived distribution, or [[probability measure|\"measure\"]].\n\nWith this measure in place, the expected, i.e. required, return of any security (or portfolio) will then equal the riskless return, plus an \"adjustment for risk\",<ref name=\"Rubinstein\"/> i.e. a security-specific [[risk premium]], compensating for the extent to which its cashflows are unpredictable. All pricing models are then essentially variants of this, given specific assumptions and/or conditions.<ref name=\"Rubinstein\"/><ref name=\"Cochrane & Culp\"/> This approach is consistent with [[#Present value, expectation and utility|the above]], but with the expectation based on \"the market\" (i.e. arbitrage-free, and, per the theorem, therefore in equilibrium) as opposed to individual preferences.\n\nThus, continuing the example, in pricing a [[derivative (finance)|derivative instrument]] its forecasted cashflows in the up- and down-states, <math>X_{up}</math> and <math>X_{down}</math>, are multiplied through by <math>q_{up}</math> and <math>q_{down}</math>, and are then [[present value|discounted]] at the risk-free interest rate; per equation above.  In pricing a \u201cfundamental\u201d, underlying, instrument (in equilibrium), on the other hand, a risk-appropriate premium over risk-free is required in the discounting, essentially employing the first equation with <math>Y</math> and <math>r</math> combined. In general, this may be derived by the [[Capital asset pricing model|CAPM]] (or extensions) as will be seen under [[#Uncertainty]]. \n\nThe difference is explained as follows: By construction, the value of the derivative will (must) grow at the risk free rate, and, by arbitrage arguments, its value must then be discounted correspondingly; in the case of an option, this is achieved by \u201cmanufacturing\u201d the instrument as a combination of the [[underlying]] and a risk free \u201cbond\u201d; see {{sectionlink|Rational pricing|Delta hedging}} (and [[#Uncertainty]] below). Where the underlying is itself being priced, such construction is of course not possible - the instrument being \"fundamental\" - and a premium is then required for risk.\n\n===State prices===\nWith the above relationship established, the further specialized [[Arrow\u2013Debreu model]] may be derived. This important result suggests that, under certain economic conditions, there must be a set of prices such that aggregate supplies will equal aggregate demands for every commodity in the economy. The analysis here is often undertaken assuming a ''[[representative agent]]''.<ref name=\"Doyne_Geanakoplos\"/>\nThe Arrow\u2013Debreu model applies to economies with maximally [[complete market]]s, in which there exists a market for every time period and forward prices for every commodity at all time periods. \n\nA direct extension, then, is the concept of a [[state price]] security (also called an Arrow\u2013Debreu security), a contract that agrees to pay one unit of a [[numeraire]] (a currency or a commodity) if a particular state occurs (\"up\" and \"down\" in the simplified example above) at a particular time in the future and pays zero numeraire in all the other states. The price of this security is the state price <math>\\pi_{s}</math> of this particular state of the world.\n\nIn the above example, the state prices, <math>\\pi_{up}</math>,  <math>\\pi_{down}</math>would equate to the present values of <math>$q_{up}</math> and <math>$q_{down}</math>: i.e. what one would pay today, respectively, for the up- and down-state securities; the [[state price vector]] is the vector of state prices for all states.\nApplied to derivative valuation, the price today would simply be [<math>\\pi_{up}</math>\u00d7<math>X_{up}</math> + <math>\\pi_{down}</math>\u00d7<math>X_{down}</math>]; the second formula (see above regarding the absence of a risk premium here). For a [[continuous random variable]] indicating a continuum of possible states, the value is found by [[integration (mathematics)|integrating]] over the state price \"density\". These concepts are extended to [[martingale pricing]] and the related [[risk-neutral measure]]. See also [[Stochastic discount factor]].\n\nState prices find immediate application as a conceptual tool (\"[[contingent claim analysis]]\");<ref name=\"Rubinstein\"/> but can also be applied to valuation problems.<ref name=\"corp fin state prices\">See de Matos, as well as Bossaerts and \u00d8degaard, under bibliography.</ref> Given the pricing mechanism described, one can decompose the derivative value \u2014 true in fact for \"every security\"<ref name=\"Miller\"/> \u2014  as a linear combination of its state-prices; i.e. back-solve for the state-prices corresponding to observed derivative prices.<ref name=\"Chance2\"/><ref name=\"corp fin state prices\"/> These recovered state-prices can then be used for valuation of other instruments with exposure to the underlyer, or for other decision making relating to the underlyer itself. (Breeden and Litzenberger's work in 1978<ref>{{cite journal |title=Prices of State-Contingent Claims Implicit in Option Prices |first=Douglas T. |last=Breeden |first2=Robert H. |last2=Litzenberger |author2-link=Robert Litzenberger |journal=[[Journal of Business]] |volume=51 |issue=4 |year=1978 |pages=621\u2013651 |jstor=2352653 |doi=10.1086/296025}}</ref> established the use of state prices in financial economics.)\n\n==Resultant models==\n[[Image:MM2.png|thumb|right|Modigliani\u2013Miller Proposition II with risky debt.

As above, the two usual areas of focus are Asset Pricing and Corporate Finance, the first being the perspective of providers of capital, the second of users of capital. Here, and for (almost) all other financial economics models, the questions addressed are typically framed in terms of \"time, uncertainty, options, and information\",<ref name=\"stanford1\"/><ref name=\"Doyne_Geanakoplos\"/> as will be seen below.\n* Time: money now is traded for money in the future.\n* Uncertainty (or risk): The amount of money to be transferred in the future is uncertain.\n* [[Option (finance)|Options]]: one party to the transaction can make a decision at a later time that will affect subsequent transfers of money.\n* [[Perfect information|Information]]: knowledge of the future can reduce, or possibly eliminate, the uncertainty associated with [[Future value|future monetary value]] (FMV).\nApplying this framework, with the above concepts, leads to the required models. This derivation begins with the assumption of \"no uncertainty\" and is then expanded to incorporate the other considerations. (This division sometimes denoted \"[[deterministic]]\" and \"random\",<ref name=\"Luenberger\"/> or \"[[stochastic]]\".)\n\n===Certainty===\nThe starting point here is \u201cInvestment under certainty\". The [[Fisher separation theorem]], asserts that the objective of a corporation will be the maximization of its present value, regardless of the preferences of its shareholders. Related is the [[Modigliani\u2013Miller theorem]], which shows that, under certain conditions, the value of a firm is unaffected by how that firm is financed, and depends neither on its dividend policy nor its decision to raise capital by issuing stock or selling debt. The proof here proceeds using arbitrage arguments, and acts as a benchmark for evaluating the effects of factors outside the model that do affect value.\n\nThe mechanism for determining (corporate) value is provided by ''[[The Theory of Investment Value]]'', which proposes that the value of an asset should be calculated using \"evaluation by the rule of present worth\". Thus, for a common stock, the intrinsic, long-term worth is the present value of its future net cashflows, in the form of [[dividend]]s. What remains to be determined is the appropriate discount rate. Later developments show that, \"rationally\", i.e. in the formal sense, the appropriate discount rate here will (should) depend on the asset's riskiness relative to the overall market, as opposed to its owners' preferences; see below. [[Net present value]] (NPV) is the direct extension of these ideas typically applied to Corporate Finance decisioning. For other results, as well as specific models developed here, see the list of \"Equity valuation\" topics under {{sectionlink|Outline of finance|Discounted cash flow valuation}}.\n([[John Burr Williams]] published his \"Theory\" in 1938; NPV was introduced by [[Joel Dean (economist)|Joel Dean]] in 1951)\n\n[[Bond valuation]], in that cashflows (coupons and return of principal) are deterministic, may proceed in the same fashion.<ref name=\"Luenberger\">See Luenberger's ''Investment Science'', under Bibliography.</ref> An immediate extension, [[Bond valuation#Arbitrage-free pricing approach|Arbitrage-free bond pricing]], discounts each cashflow at the market derived rate \u2014 i.e. at each coupon's corresponding zero-rate \u2014 as opposed to an overall rate. In many treatments bond valuation precedes [[equity valuation]], under which cashflows (dividends) are not \"known\" ''per se''. Williams and onward allow for forecasting as to these \u2014 based on historic ratios or published policy \u2014 and cashflows are then treated as essentially deterministic; see below under [[#Corporate finance theory]].\n\nThese \"certainty\" results are all commonly employed under corporate finance; uncertainty is the focus of \"asset pricing models\", as follows.\n\n===Uncertainty===\nFor [[Decision theory#Choice under uncertainty|\"choice under uncertainty\"]] the twin assumptions of rationality and [[Financial market efficiency|market efficiency]], as more closely defined, lead to [[modern portfolio theory]] (MPT) with its [[capital asset pricing model]] (CAPM)\u2014an ''equilibrium-based'' result\u2014and to the [[Black\u2013Scholes model|Black\u2013Scholes\u2013Merton theory]] (BSM; often, simply Black\u2013Scholes) for [[Valuation of options|option pricing]]\u2014an ''arbitrage-free'' result. As above, the (intuitive) link between these, is that the latter derivative prices are calculated such that they are arbitrage-free with respect to the more fundamental, equilibrium determined, securities prices; see [[asset pricing]].\n\nBriefly, and intuitively\u2014and consistent with [[#Arbitrage-free pricing and equilibrium]] above\u2014the relationship between rationality and efficiency is as follows.<ref>\nFor a more formal treatment, see, for example: Eugene F. Fama. 1965. [http://www.cfapubs.org/toc/faj/1965/21/5 Random Walks in Stock Market Prices]. ''[[Financial Analysts Journal]]'', September/October 1965, Vol. 21, No. 5: 55\u201359.</ref> \nGiven the ability to profit from private information, self-interested traders are motivated to acquire and act on their private information. In doing so, traders contribute to more and more \"correct\", i.e. ''efficient'', prices: the [[efficient-market hypothesis]], or EMH. Thus, if prices of financial assets are (broadly) efficient, then deviations from these (equilibrium) values could not last for long. (See [[Earnings response coefficient]].)\nThe EMH (implicitly) assumes that average expectations constitute an \"optimal forecast\", i.e. prices using all available information, are identical to the ''best guess of the future'': the assumption of [[rational expectations]]. \nThe EMH does allow that when faced with new information, some investors may overreact and some may underreact, but what is required, however, is that investors' reactions follow a [[normal distribution]]\u2014so that the net effect on market prices cannot be reliably exploited to make an abnormal profit.\nIn the competitive limit, then, market prices will reflect all available information and prices can only move in response to news:<ref name=\"Shiller\"/> the [[random walk hypothesis]]. \nThis news, of course, could be \"good\" or \"bad\", minor or, less common, major; and these moves are then, correspondingly, normally distributed; with the price therefore following a log-normal distribution. \n(The EMH was presented by [[Eugene Fama]] in a 1970 review paper,<ref>Fama, Eugene (1970). \"Efficient Capital Markets: A Review of Theory and Empirical Work\". Journal of Finance.</ref> consolidating previous works re random walks in stock prices: [[Jules Regnault]], 1863; [[Louis Bachelier]], 1900; [[Maurice Kendall]], 1953; [[Paul Cootner]], 1964; and [[Paul Samuelson]], 1965, among others.)\n\nUnder these conditions investors can then be assumed to act rationally: their investment decision must be calculated or a loss is sure to follow; correspondingly, where an arbitrage opportunity presents itself, then arbitrageurs will exploit it, reinforcing this equilibrium.\nHere, as under the certainty-case above, the specific assumption as to pricing is that prices are calculated as the present value of expected future dividends,\n<ref name=\"Cochrane & Culp\">Christopher L.

Relatedly, rationality \u2014 in the sense of arbitrage-exploitation \u2014 gives rise to Black\u2013Scholes; option values here ultimately consistent with the CAPM.\n\nIn general, then, while portfolio theory studies how investors should balance risk and return when investing in many assets or securities, the CAPM is more focused, describing how, in equilibrium, markets set the prices of assets in relation to how risky they are.\nImportantly, this result will be independent of the investor's level of risk aversion, and / or assumed utility function, thus providing a readily determined discount rate for corporate finance decision makers [[Financial economics#Certainty|as above]],<ref name=\"Jensen&Smith\">[[Michael C. Jensen|Jensen, Michael C.]] and Smith, Clifford W., \"The Theory of Corporate Finance: A Historical Overview\".

The CAPM was derived by [[Jack L. Treynor|Jack Treynor]] (1961, 1962), [[William F. Sharpe]] (1964), [[John Lintner]] (1965) and [[Jan Mossin]] (1966) independently. )\n\nBlack\u2013Scholes provides a mathematical model of a financial market containing [[Derivative (finance)|derivative]] instruments, and the resultant formula for the price of [[option style|European-styled options]].\nThe model is expressed as the Black\u2013Scholes equation, a [[partial differential equation]] describing the changing price of the option over time; it is derived assuming log-normal, [[geometric Brownian motion]] (see [[Brownian model of financial markets]]).\nThe key financial insight behind the model is that one can perfectly hedge the option by buying and selling the underlying asset in just the right way and consequently \"eliminate risk\", absenting the risk adjustment from the pricing (<math>V</math>, the value, or price, of the option, grows at <math>r</math>, the risk-free rate).<ref name=\"Rubinstein\"/><ref name=\"Cochrane & Culp\"/>\nThis hedge, in turn, implies that there is only one right price\u2014in an arbitrage-free sense\u2014for the option. And this price is returned by the Black\u2013Scholes option pricing formula. (The formula, and hence the price, is consistent with the equation, as the formula is [[Partial differential equation#Analytical solutions|the solution]] to the equation.)\nSince the formula is without reference to the share's expected return, Black\u2013Scholes inheres risk neutrality; intuitively consistent with the \"elimination of risk\" here, and mathematically consistent with [[#Arbitrage-free pricing and equilibrium]] above. Relatedly, therefore, the pricing formula may also be derived directly via risk neutral expectation.\n(BSM -  two seminal 1973 papers by [[Fischer Black]] & [[Myron Scholes]],<ref name=\"BlackScholes_paper\">{{cite journal|title=The Pricing of Options and Corporate Liabilities|last=Black|first=Fischer|author2=Myron Scholes|journal=Journal of Political Economy|year=1973|volume=81|issue=3|pages=637\u2013654|doi=10.1086/260062}} [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1831029]</ref>  \nand [[Robert C.

As regards [[asset pricing]], developments in equilibrium-based pricing are discussed under \"Portfolio theory\" below, while \"Derivative pricing\" relates to risk-neutral, i.e. arbitrage-free, pricing.  As regards the use of capital, \"Corporate finance theory\" relates, mainly, to the application of these models.\n\n===Portfolio theory===\n[[Image:Pareto Efficient Frontier for the Markowitz Portfolio selection problem..png|thumb|right|200px|Plot of two criteria when maximizing return and minimizing risk in financial portfolios (Pareto-optimal points in red)]]\n[[File:Four Correlations.png|thumb|right|alt=Examples of bivariate copul\u00e6 used in finance.|Examples of bivariate copul\u00e6 used in finance.]]\n:''See also: [[Post-modern portfolio theory]] and {{sectionlink|Mathematical finance|Risk and portfolio management: the P world}}.''\nThe majority of developments here relate to required return, i.e. pricing, extending the basic CAPM. Multi-factor models such as the [[Fama\u2013French three-factor model]] and the [[Carhart four-factor model]], propose factors other than market return as relevant in pricing. The [[intertemporal CAPM]] and [[Consumption-based capital asset pricing model|consumption-based CAPM]] similarly extend the model. With [[intertemporal portfolio choice]], the investor now repeatedly optimizes her portfolio; while the inclusion of [[Consumption (economics)|consumption (in the economic sense)]] then incorporates all sources of wealth, and not just market-based investments, into the investor's calculation of required return.\n\nWhereas the above extend the CAPM, the [[single-index model]] is a more simple model. It assumes, only, a correlation between security and market returns, without (numerous) other economic assumptions. It is useful in that it simplifies the estimation of correlation between securities, significantly reducing the inputs for building the correlation matrix required for portfolio optimization. The [[arbitrage pricing theory]] (APT; [[Stephen Ross (economist)|Stephen Ross]], 1976) similarly differs as regards its assumptions. APT \"gives up the notion that there is one right portfolio for everyone in the world, and ...replaces it with an explanatory model of what drives asset returns.\"<ref>''The Arbitrage Pricing Theory,'' Chapter VI in Goetzmann, under External links.</ref> It returns the required (expected) return of a financial asset as a linear function of various macro-economic factors, and assumes that arbitrage should bring incorrectly priced assets back into line.\n\nAs regards [[portfolio optimization]], the [[Black\u2013Litterman model]] departs from the original [[Markowitz model]] - i.e. of constructing portfolios via an [[efficient frontier]]. Black\u2013Litterman instead starts with an equilibrium assumption, and is then modified to take into account the 'views' (i.e., the specific opinions about asset returns) of the investor in question to arrive at a bespoke asset allocation. Where factors additional to volatility are considered (kurtosis, skew...) then [[multiple-criteria decision analysis]] can be applied; here deriving a [[Pareto efficient]] portfolio. The [[universal portfolio algorithm]] ([[Thomas M. Cover]], 1991) applies [[machine learning]] to asset selection, learning adaptively from historical data. [[Behavioral portfolio theory]] recognizes that investors have varied aims and create an investment portfolio that meets a broad range of goals.  Copulas have [[Copula (probability theory)#Quantitative finance|lately been applied here]]; recently this is the case also [[List_of_genetic_algorithm_applications#Finance_and_Economics|for genetic algorithms]] and [[Machine learning #Applications|Machine learning, more generally]].

Discretized models of this type are built\u2014at least implicitly\u2014using state-prices ([[#State prices|as above]]); relatedly, a large number of researchers have used options to extract state-prices for a variety of other applications in financial economics.<ref name=\"Rubinstein\"/><ref name=\"Chance1\"/><ref name=\"Chance2\">Don M.

Various [[Option (finance)#Model implementation|other numeric techniques]] have also been developed. The theoretical framework too has been extended such that [[martingale pricing]] is now the standard approach.\n\nDrawing on these techniques, models for various other underlyings and applications have also been developed, all based off the same logic (using \"[[contingent claim analysis]]\"). [[Real options valuation]] allows that option holders can influence the option's underlying; models for [[Employee stock option#Valuation|employee stock option valuation]] explicitly assume non-rationality on the part of option holders; [[Credit derivative]]s allow that payment obligations and / or delivery requirements might not be honored. [[Exotic derivative]]s are now routinely valued. Multi-asset underlyers are handled via simulation or [[Copula (probability theory)#Quantitative finance|copula based analysis]].\n\nSimilarly, the various [[short rate model]]s allow for an extension of these techniques to [[Fixed income#Derivatives|fixed income-]] and [[interest rate derivative]]s. (The [[Vasicek model| Vasicek]] and [[Cox\u2013Ingersoll\u2013Ross model|CIR]] models are equilibrium-based, while [[Ho\u2013Lee model|Ho\u2013Lee]] and subsequent models are based on arbitrage-free pricing.) \nThe more general [[Heath\u2013Jarrow\u2013Morton framework|HJM Framework]] describes the dynamics of the full [[forward rate]] curve - as opposed to working with short rates - and is then more widely applied.\nThe valuation of the underlying bonds -  additional to their derivatives - is relatedly extended, particularly for [[Hybrid security |hybrid securities]], where credit risk is combined with uncertainty re future rates; \nsee {{sectionlink|Bond valuation|Stochastic calculus approach}} and {{sectionlink|Lattice model (finance)|Hybrid securities}}.\n([[Oldrich Vasicek]] developed his pioneering short rate model in 1977.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Vasicek |first=O. |date=1977 |title=An equilibrium characterization of the term structure |journal=[[Journal of Financial Economics]] |volume=5 |issue=2 |pages=177\u2013188 |doi=10.1016/0304-405X(77)90016-2 |citeseerx=10.1.1.164.447 }}</ref> \nThe HJM framework originates from the work of [[David Heath (probabilist) |David Heath]], [[Robert A.

(The pattern differs across various markets.) Modelling the volatility smile is an active area of research, and developments here \u2014 as well as implications re the standard theory \u2014 are discussed [[#Departures from normality|in the next section]].\n\nAfter the [[financial crisis of 2007\u20132008]], a further development: ([[Over-the-counter (finance)|over the counter]]) derivative pricing had relied on the BSM risk neutral pricing framework, under the assumptions of funding at the risk free rate and the ability to perfectly replicate cashflows so as to fully hedge. This, in turn, is built on the assumption of a credit-risk-free environment \u2014 called into question during the crisis. \nAddressing this, therefore, issues such as [[counterparty credit risk]], funding costs and costs of capital are now additionally considered when pricing,<ref>[http://pure.au.dk/portal-asb-student/files/96440392/Master_Thesis_Pure.pdf \"Post-Crisis Pricing of Swaps using xVAs\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160917015231/http://pure.au.dk/portal-asb-student/files/96440392/Master_Thesis_Pure.pdf |date=2016-09-17 }}, Christian Kj\u00f8lhede & Anders Bech, Master thesis, [[Aarhus University]]</ref> and a [[Credit Valuation Adjustment]], or CVA\u2014and potentially other ''valuation adjustments'', collectively [[xVA]]\u2014is generally added to the risk-neutral derivative value.\n\nA related, and perhaps more fundamental change, is that discounting is now on the [[Overnight index swap|Overnight Index Swap]] (OIS) curve, as opposed to [[LIBOR]] as used previously. This is because post-crisis, the [[overnight rate]]  is considered a better proxy for the \"risk-free rate\".<ref>{{cite journal |title=LIBOR vs. OIS: The Derivatives Discounting Dilemma |first=John |last=Hull |first2=Alan |last2=White |journal=[[Journal of Investment Management]] |volume=11 |issue=3 |year=2013 |pages=14\u201327}}</ref> (Also, practically, the interest paid on cash [[collateral (finance)|collateral]] is usually the overnight rate; OIS discounting is then, sometimes, referred to as \"[[Credit Support Annex|CSA]] discounting\".) [[Swap (finance)#Valuation|Swap pricing]] - and, therefore, [[yield curve]] construction - is further modified: previously, swaps were valued off a single \"self discounting\" interest rate curve; whereas post crisis, to accommodate OIS discounting, valuation is now under a \"[[multi-curve framework]]\" where \"forecast curves\" are constructed for each floating-leg [[Libor#Maturities|LIBOR tenor]], with discounting on the ''common'' OIS curve.\n\n===Corporate finance theory===\n[[Image:Manual decision tree.jpg|right|thumb|Project valuation via decision tree.]]\nCorporate finance theory has also been extended: mirroring the [[#Certainty|above]] developments, asset-valuation and decisioning no longer need assume \"certainty\". \n[[Monte Carlo methods in finance]] allow financial analysts to construct \"[[stochastic]]\" or [[probabilistic]] corporate finance models, as opposed to the traditional static and [[deterministic]] models;<ref name=\"Damodaran_Risk\"/> see {{sectionlink|Corporate finance|Quantifying uncertainty}}. \nRelatedly, Real Options theory allows for owner\u2014i.e. managerial\u2014actions that impact underlying value: by incorporating option pricing logic, these actions are then applied to a distribution of future outcomes, changing with time, which then determine the \"project's\" valuation today.<ref name=\"Damodaran\"/> \n(Simulation was first applied to (corporate) finance by [[David B.

The Z-axis represents implied volatility in percent, and X and Y axes represent the option delta, and the days to maturity.]]\n{{See also|Capital asset pricing model#Problems|Modern portfolio theory#Criticisms|Black\u2013Scholes model#Criticism and comments}}\nAs discussed, the assumptions that market prices follow a [[random walk]] and / or that asset returns are normally distributed are fundamental. Empirical evidence, however, suggests that these assumptions may not hold (see [[Kurtosis risk]], [[Skewness risk]], [[Long tail]]) and that in practice, traders, analysts and [[financial risk management|risk managers]] frequently modify the \"standard models\" (see [[Model risk]]). In fact, [[Benoit Mandelbrot]] had discovered already in the 1960s that changes in financial prices do not follow a [[normal distribution]], the basis for much option pricing theory, although this observation was slow to find its way into mainstream financial economics.\n\n[[Financial models with long-tailed distributions and volatility clustering]] have been introduced to overcome problems with the realism of the above \"classical\" financial models; while [[Jump diffusion#In economics and finance|jump diffusion models]] allow for (option) pricing incorporating [[jump process|\"jumps\"]] in the [[spot price]].<ref name=\"holes\">{{cite journal |title=  How to use the holes in Black-Scholes |first= Fischer |last=Black|author-link1=Fischer Black |journal=[[Journal of Applied Corporate Finance]] |volume=1|issue=Jan|year=1989|pages=67\u201373|jstor=|doi=10.1111/j.1745-6622.1989.tb00175.x}}</ref> \nRisk managers, similarly, complement (or substitute) the standard [[value at risk]] models with [[Historical simulation (finance)|historical simulations]], [[Mixture model#A financial model|mixture models]], [[principal component analysis]], [[extreme value theory]], as well as models for [[volatility clustering]].<ref>See for example III.A.3, in Carol Alexander, ed.

PRMIA Publications. {{ISBN|978-0976609704}}</ref> \nFor further discussion see {{sectionlink|Fat-tailed distribution|Applications in economics}}, and {{sectionlink|Value at risk|Criticism}}.\nPortfolio managers, likewise, have modified their optimization criteria and algorithms; see [[#Portfolio theory]] above. \n\nClosely related is the [[volatility smile]], where, as above, [[implied volatility]] \u2014 the volatility corresponding to the BSM price \u2014 is observed to ''differ'' as a function of [[strike price]] (i.e. [[moneyness]]), true only if the price-change distribution is non-normal, unlike that assumed by BSM. \nThe term structure of volatility describes how (implied) volatility differs for related options with different maturities. \nAn implied volatility surface is then a three-dimensional surface plot of volatility smile and term structure. \nThese empirical phenomena negate the assumption of constant volatility\u2014and [[log-normal]]ity\u2014upon which Black\u2013Scholes is built.<ref name=\"Haug Taleb\"/><ref name=\"holes\"/>  \nWithin institutions, the function of Black-Scholes is now, largely, to ''communicate'' prices via implied volatilities, much like bond prices are communicated via [[yield to maturity|YTM]]; see {{sectionlink|Black\u2013Scholes model|The volatility smile}}.\n\nIn consequence traders (and risk managers) now, instead, use \"smile-consistent\" models, firstly, when valuing derivatives not directly mapped to the surface, facilitating the pricing of other, i.e. non-quoted, strike/maturity combinations, or of non-European derivatives, and generally for hedging purposes.  \nThe two main approaches are [[local volatility]] and [[stochastic volatility]]. \nThe first returns the volatility which is \u201clocal\u201d to each spot-time point of the [[Finite difference methods for option pricing|finite difference-]] or [[Monte Carlo methods for option pricing|simulation-based valuation]]; i.e. as opposed to implied volatility, which holds overall.  In this way calculated prices \u2014 and numeric structures \u2014 are market-consistent in an arbitrage-free sense.  The second approach assumes that the volatility of the underlying price is a stochastic process rather than a constant. Models here are first [[Stochastic volatility#Calibration and estimation|calibrated to observed prices]], and are then applied to the valuation or hedging in question; the most common are [[Heston model|Heston]], [[SABR volatility model|SABR]] and [[Constant elasticity of variance model|CEV]]. This approach addresses certain problems identified with hedging under local volatility.<ref>{{cite journal |title=  Managing smile risk |first= Patrick |last=Hagan |display-authors=etal|journal=[[Wilmott Magazine]] |volume=|issue=Sep|year=2002 |pages=84\u2013108|jstor=|doi=}}</ref>\n\nRelated to local volatility are the [[Lattice model (finance)|lattice]]-based [[Implied binomial tree|implied-binomial]] and [[Implied trinomial tree|-trinomial trees]] \u2014 essentially a discretization of the approach \u2014 which are similarly (but less commonly) used for pricing; these are built on state-prices recovered from the surface. \n[[Edgeworth binomial tree]]s allow for a specified (i.e. non-Gaussian) [[Skewness|skew]] and [[kurtosis]] in the spot price; priced here, options with differing strikes will return differing implied volatilities, and the tree can be calibrated to the smile as required.<ref>See for example Pg 217 of: Jackson, Mary; Mike Staunton (2001).

Working paper, [[London School of Economics and Political Science]].</ref>\n\nAs discussed, additional to assuming log-normality in returns, \"classical\" BSM-type models also (implicitly) assume the existence of a credit-risk-free environment, where one can perfectly replicate cashflows so as to fully hedge, and then discount at \"the\" risk-free-rate.  \nAnd therefore, post crisis, the various x-value adjustments must be employed, effectively correcting the risk-neutral value for [[counterparty credit risk|counterparty-]] and [[XVA#Valuation_adjustments|funding-related]] risk.\nThese xVA are ''additional'' to any smile or surface effect. This is valid as the surface is built on price data relating to fully collateralized positions, and there is therefore no \"[[double counting (accounting)|double counting]]\" of credit risk (etc.) when appending xVA. (Were this not the case, then each counterparty would have its own surface...) \n\nAs mentioned at top, mathematical finance (and particularly [[financial engineering]]) is more concerned with mathematical consistency (and market realities) than compatibility with economic theory, and the above \"extreme event\" approaches, smile-consistent modeling, and valuation adjustments should then be seen in this light. \nRecognizing this, [[James Rickards]], amongst other critics of financial economics, suggests that, instead, the theory needs revisiting almost entirely: \n:\"The  current  system,  based  on  the  idea  that  risk  is  distributed  in  the  shape  of  a  bell  curve,  is  flawed...  The  problem  is  [that economists and practitioners]  never  abandon  the  bell  curve.

Recently, however, researchers in [[experimental economics]] and [[experimental finance]] have challenged this assumption [[Empirical evidence|empirically]]. These assumptions are also challenged [[Theory|theoretically]], by [[behavioral finance]], a discipline primarily concerned with the limits to rationality of economic agents.\n\nConsistent with, and complementary to these findings, various persistent [[Market anomaly|market anomalies]] have been documented, these being price and/or return distortions\u2014e.g. [[size premium]]s\u2014which appear to contradict the [[efficient-market hypothesis]]; [[calendar effect]]s are the best known group here. Related to these are various of the [[economic puzzle]]s, concerning phenomena similarly contradicting the theory. The ''[[equity premium puzzle]]'', as one example, arises in that the difference between the observed returns on stocks as compared to government bonds is consistently higher than the [[risk premium]] rational equity investors should demand, an \"[[abnormal return]]\".

The subject is thus built on the foundations of [[microeconomics]] and decision theory, and derives several key results for the application of [[decision making]] under uncertainty to the [[financial market]]s. The underlying economic logic distills to a \u201dfundamental valuation result\u201d,<ref name=\"Rubinstein\"/><ref name=\"Cochrane & Culp\"/> as aside, which is developed in the following sections.\n\n===Present value, expectation and utility===\nUnderlying all of financial economics are the concepts of [[present value]] and [[Expected value|expectation]].<ref name=\"Rubinstein\"/>\n\nCalculating their present value allows the decision maker to aggregate the [[cashflow]]s (or other returns) to be produced by the asset in the future, to a single value at the date in question, and to thus more readily compare two opportunities; this concept is therefore the starting point for financial decision making. (Its history is correspondingly early: [[Richard Witt]] discusses [[compound interest]] in depth already in 1613, in his book \"Arithmeticall Questions\";<ref>C. Lewin (1970). [https://www.actuaries.org.uk/system/files/documents/pdf/0121-0132.pdf An early book on compound interest] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161221163926/https://www.actuaries.org.uk/system/files/documents/pdf/0121-0132.pdf |date=2016-12-21 }}, Institute and Faculty of Actuaries</ref> further developed by [[Johan de Witt]] and [[Edmond Halley]].)\n\nAn immediate extension is to combine probabilities with present value, leading to the [[Expected value|expected value criterion]] which sets asset value as a function of the sizes of the expected payouts and the probabilities of their occurrence, <math>X_{s}</math> and <math>p_{s}</math> respectively. (These ideas originate with [[Blaise Pascal]] and [[Pierre de Fermat]] in 1654.)\n\nThis decision method, however, fails to consider [[risk aversion]] (\"as any student of finance knows\"<ref name=\"Rubinstein\"/>). In other words, since individuals receive greater [[Utility#Economic definitions|utility]] from an extra dollar when they are poor and less utility when comparatively rich, the approach is to therefore \"adjust\" the weight assigned to the various outcomes (\"states\") correspondingly, <math>Y_{s}</math>. See [[Indifference price]]. (Some investors may in fact be [[risk seeking]] as opposed to [[Risk aversion|risk averse]], but the same logic would apply).\n\nChoice under uncertainty here may then be characterized as the maximization of [[expected utility]]. More formally, the resulting [[expected utility hypothesis]] states that, if certain axioms are satisfied, the [[Subjective theory of value|subjective]] value associated with a gamble by an individual is ''that individual''{{'}}s [[Expected value|statistical expectation]] of the valuations of the outcomes of that gamble.\n\nThe impetus for these ideas arise from various inconsistencies observed under the expected value framework, such as the [[St. Petersburg paradox]]; see also [[Ellsberg paradox]]. (The development here is originally due to [[Daniel Bernoulli]] in 1738, and later formalized by [[John von Neumann]] and [[Oskar Morgenstern]] in 1947.)\n\n===Arbitrage-free pricing and equilibrium===\n{| class=\"wikitable floatright\" | width=\"250\"\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|JEL classification codes\n|-\n|In the [[JEL classification codes|Journal of Economic Literature classification codes]], Financial Economics is one of the 19 primary classifications, at JEL: G.

This assumption is useful in pricing fixed income securities, particularly bonds, and is fundamental to the pricing of derivative instruments.\n\n[[Economic equilibrium]] is, in general, a state in which economic forces such as supply and demand are balanced, and, in the absence of external influences these equilibrium values of economic variables will not change. [[General equilibrium theory|General equilibrium]] deals with the behavior of supply, demand, and prices in a whole economy with several or many interacting markets, by seeking to prove that a set of prices exists that will result in an overall equilibrium. (This is in contrast to partial equilibrium, which only analyzes single markets.)\n\nThe two concepts are linked as follows: where market prices do not allow for profitable arbitrage, i.e. they comprise an arbitrage-free market, then these prices are also said to constitute an \"arbitrage equilibrium\". Intuitively, this may be seen by considering that where an arbitrage opportunity does exist, then prices can be expected to change, and are therefore not in equilibrium.<ref name=\"Delbaen_Schachermayer\"/> An arbitrage equilibrium is thus a precondition for a general economic equilibrium.\n\nThe immediate, and formal, extension of this idea, the [[fundamental theorem of asset pricing]], shows that where markets are as described \u2014and are additionally (implicitly and correspondingly) [[complete market|complete]]\u2014one may then make financial decisions by constructing a [[Risk-neutral measure|risk neutral probability measure]] corresponding to the market.\n\"Complete\" here means that there is a price for every asset in every possible state of the world, <math>s</math>, and that the complete set of possible bets on future states-of-the-world can therefore be constructed with existing assets (assuming [[Frictionless market|no friction]]): essentially [[System of linear equations|solving simultaneously]] for ''n'' (risk-neutral) probabilities, <math>q_{s}</math>, given ''n'' prices. The formal derivation will proceed by arbitrage arguments.<ref name=\"Rubinstein\"/><ref name=\"Delbaen_Schachermayer\">Freddy Delbaen and Walter Schachermayer. (2004).

Notices of the AMS 51 (5): 526\u2013528</ref> For a simplified example see {{sectionlink|Rational pricing|Risk neutral valuation}}, where the economy has only two possible states\u2014up and down\u2014and where <math>q_{up}</math> and <math>q_{down}</math> (=<math>1-q_{up}</math>) are the two corresponding (i.e. implied) probabilities, and in turn, the derived distribution, or [[probability measure|\"measure\"]].\n\nWith this measure in place, the expected, i.e. required, return of any security (or portfolio) will then equal the riskless return, plus an \"adjustment for risk\",<ref name=\"Rubinstein\"/> i.e. a security-specific [[risk premium]], compensating for the extent to which its cashflows are unpredictable. All pricing models are then essentially variants of this, given specific assumptions and/or conditions.<ref name=\"Rubinstein\"/><ref name=\"Cochrane & Culp\"/> This approach is consistent with [[#Present value, expectation and utility|the above]], but with the expectation based on \"the market\" (i.e. arbitrage-free, and, per the theorem, therefore in equilibrium) as opposed to individual preferences.\n\nThus, continuing the example, in pricing a [[derivative (finance)|derivative instrument]] its forecasted cashflows in the up- and down-states, <math>X_{up}</math> and <math>X_{down}</math>, are multiplied through by <math>q_{up}</math> and <math>q_{down}</math>, and are then [[present value|discounted]] at the risk-free interest rate; per equation above.  In pricing a \u201cfundamental\u201d, underlying, instrument (in equilibrium), on the other hand, a risk-appropriate premium over risk-free is required in the discounting, essentially employing the first equation with <math>Y</math> and <math>r</math> combined. In general, this may be derived by the [[Capital asset pricing model|CAPM]] (or extensions) as will be seen under [[#Uncertainty]]. \n\nThe difference is explained as follows: By construction, the value of the derivative will (must) grow at the risk free rate, and, by arbitrage arguments, its value must then be discounted correspondingly; in the case of an option, this is achieved by \u201cmanufacturing\u201d the instrument as a combination of the [[underlying]] and a risk free \u201cbond\u201d; see {{sectionlink|Rational pricing|Delta hedging}} (and [[#Uncertainty]] below). Where the underlying is itself being priced, such construction is of course not possible - the instrument being \"fundamental\" - and a premium is then required for risk.\n\n===State prices===\nWith the above relationship established, the further specialized [[Arrow\u2013Debreu model]] may be derived. This important result suggests that, under certain economic conditions, there must be a set of prices such that aggregate supplies will equal aggregate demands for every commodity in the economy. The analysis here is often undertaken assuming a ''[[representative agent]]''.<ref name=\"Doyne_Geanakoplos\"/>\nThe Arrow\u2013Debreu model applies to economies with maximally [[complete market]]s, in which there exists a market for every time period and forward prices for every commodity at all time periods. \n\nA direct extension, then, is the concept of a [[state price]] security (also called an Arrow\u2013Debreu security), a contract that agrees to pay one unit of a [[numeraire]] (a currency or a commodity) if a particular state occurs (\"up\" and \"down\" in the simplified example above) at a particular time in the future and pays zero numeraire in all the other states. The price of this security is the state price <math>\\pi_{s}</math> of this particular state of the world.\n\nIn the above example, the state prices, <math>\\pi_{up}</math>,  <math>\\pi_{down}</math>would equate to the present values of <math>$q_{up}</math> and <math>$q_{down}</math>: i.e. what one would pay today, respectively, for the up- and down-state securities; the [[state price vector]] is the vector of state prices for all states.\nApplied to derivative valuation, the price today would simply be [<math>\\pi_{up}</math>\u00d7<math>X_{up}</math> + <math>\\pi_{down}</math>\u00d7<math>X_{down}</math>]; the second formula (see above regarding the absence of a risk premium here). For a [[continuous random variable]] indicating a continuum of possible states, the value is found by [[integration (mathematics)|integrating]] over the state price \"density\". These concepts are extended to [[martingale pricing]] and the related [[risk-neutral measure]]. See also [[Stochastic discount factor]].\n\nState prices find immediate application as a conceptual tool (\"[[contingent claim analysis]]\");<ref name=\"Rubinstein\"/> but can also be applied to valuation problems.<ref name=\"corp fin state prices\">See de Matos, as well as Bossaerts and \u00d8degaard, under bibliography.</ref> Given the pricing mechanism described, one can decompose the derivative value \u2014 true in fact for \"every security\"<ref name=\"Miller\"/> \u2014  as a linear combination of its state-prices; i.e. back-solve for the state-prices corresponding to observed derivative prices.<ref name=\"Chance2\"/><ref name=\"corp fin state prices\"/> These recovered state-prices can then be used for valuation of other instruments with exposure to the underlyer, or for other decision making relating to the underlyer itself.

As above, the two usual areas of focus are Asset Pricing and Corporate Finance, the first being the perspective of providers of capital, the second of users of capital. Here, and for (almost) all other financial economics models, the questions addressed are typically framed in terms of \"time, uncertainty, options, and information\",<ref name=\"stanford1\"/><ref name=\"Doyne_Geanakoplos\"/> as will be seen below.\n* Time: money now is traded for money in the future.\n* Uncertainty (or risk): The amount of money to be transferred in the future is uncertain.\n* [[Option (finance)|Options]]: one party to the transaction can make a decision at a later time that will affect subsequent transfers of money.\n* [[Perfect information|Information]]: knowledge of the future can reduce, or possibly eliminate, the uncertainty associated with [[Future value|future monetary value]] (FMV).\nApplying this framework, with the above concepts, leads to the required models. This derivation begins with the assumption of \"no uncertainty\" and is then expanded to incorporate the other considerations. (This division sometimes denoted \"[[deterministic]]\" and \"random\",<ref name=\"Luenberger\"/> or \"[[stochastic]]\".)\n\n===Certainty===\nThe starting point here is \u201cInvestment under certainty\". The [[Fisher separation theorem]], asserts that the objective of a corporation will be the maximization of its present value, regardless of the preferences of its shareholders. Related is the [[Modigliani\u2013Miller theorem]], which shows that, under certain conditions, the value of a firm is unaffected by how that firm is financed, and depends neither on its dividend policy nor its decision to raise capital by issuing stock or selling debt. The proof here proceeds using arbitrage arguments, and acts as a benchmark for evaluating the effects of factors outside the model that do affect value.\n\nThe mechanism for determining (corporate) value is provided by ''[[The Theory of Investment Value]]'', which proposes that the value of an asset should be calculated using \"evaluation by the rule of present worth\". Thus, for a common stock, the intrinsic, long-term worth is the present value of its future net cashflows, in the form of [[dividend]]s. What remains to be determined is the appropriate discount rate. Later developments show that, \"rationally\", i.e. in the formal sense, the appropriate discount rate here will (should) depend on the asset's riskiness relative to the overall market, as opposed to its owners' preferences; see below. [[Net present value]] (NPV) is the direct extension of these ideas typically applied to Corporate Finance decisioning. For other results, as well as specific models developed here, see the list of \"Equity valuation\" topics under {{sectionlink|Outline of finance|Discounted cash flow valuation}}.\n([[John Burr Williams]] published his \"Theory\" in 1938; NPV was introduced by [[Joel Dean (economist)|Joel Dean]] in 1951)\n\n[[Bond valuation]], in that cashflows (coupons and return of principal) are deterministic, may proceed in the same fashion.<ref name=\"Luenberger\">See Luenberger's ''Investment Science'', under Bibliography.</ref> An immediate extension, [[Bond valuation#Arbitrage-free pricing approach|Arbitrage-free bond pricing]], discounts each cashflow at the market derived rate \u2014 i.e. at each coupon's corresponding zero-rate \u2014 as opposed to an overall rate. In many treatments bond valuation precedes [[equity valuation]], under which cashflows (dividends) are not \"known\" ''per se''. Williams and onward allow for forecasting as to these \u2014 based on historic ratios or published policy \u2014 and cashflows are then treated as essentially deterministic; see below under [[#Corporate finance theory]].\n\nThese \"certainty\" results are all commonly employed under corporate finance; uncertainty is the focus of \"asset pricing models\", as follows.\n\n===Uncertainty===\nFor [[Decision theory#Choice under uncertainty|\"choice under uncertainty\"]] the twin assumptions of rationality and [[Financial market efficiency|market efficiency]], as more closely defined, lead to [[modern portfolio theory]] (MPT) with its [[capital asset pricing model]] (CAPM)\u2014an ''equilibrium-based'' result\u2014and to the [[Black\u2013Scholes model|Black\u2013Scholes\u2013Merton theory]] (BSM; often, simply Black\u2013Scholes) for [[Valuation of options|option pricing]]\u2014an ''arbitrage-free'' result. As above, the (intuitive) link between these, is that the latter derivative prices are calculated such that they are arbitrage-free with respect to the more fundamental, equilibrium determined, securities prices; see [[asset pricing]].\n\nBriefly, and intuitively\u2014and consistent with [[#Arbitrage-free pricing and equilibrium]] above\u2014the relationship between rationality and efficiency is as follows.<ref>\nFor a more formal treatment, see, for example: Eugene F. Fama. 1965. [http://www.cfapubs.org/toc/faj/1965/21/5 Random Walks in Stock Market Prices]. ''[[Financial Analysts Journal]]'', September/October 1965, Vol. 21, No. 5: 55\u201359.</ref> \nGiven the ability to profit from private information, self-interested traders are motivated to acquire and act on their private information. In doing so, traders contribute to more and more \"correct\", i.e. ''efficient'', prices: the [[efficient-market hypothesis]], or EMH. Thus, if prices of financial assets are (broadly) efficient, then deviations from these (equilibrium) values could not last for long. (See [[Earnings response coefficient]].)\nThe EMH (implicitly) assumes that average expectations constitute an \"optimal forecast\", i.e. prices using all available information, are identical to the ''best guess of the future'': the assumption of [[rational expectations]]. \nThe EMH does allow that when faced with new information, some investors may overreact and some may underreact, but what is required, however, is that investors' reactions follow a [[normal distribution]]\u2014so that the net effect on market prices cannot be reliably exploited to make an abnormal profit.\nIn the competitive limit, then, market prices will reflect all available information and prices can only move in response to news:<ref name=\"Shiller\"/> the [[random walk hypothesis]]. \nThis news, of course, could be \"good\" or \"bad\", minor or, less common, major; and these moves are then, correspondingly, normally distributed; with the price therefore following a log-normal distribution. \n(The EMH was presented by [[Eugene Fama]] in a 1970 review paper,<ref>Fama, Eugene (1970). \"Efficient Capital Markets: A Review of Theory and Empirical Work\". Journal of Finance.</ref> consolidating previous works re random walks in stock prices: [[Jules Regnault]], 1863; [[Louis Bachelier]], 1900; [[Maurice Kendall]], 1953; [[Paul Cootner]], 1964; and [[Paul Samuelson]], 1965, among others.)\n\nUnder these conditions investors can then be assumed to act rationally: their investment decision must be calculated or a loss is sure to follow; correspondingly, where an arbitrage opportunity presents itself, then arbitrageurs will exploit it, reinforcing this equilibrium.\nHere, as under the certainty-case above, the specific assumption as to pricing is that prices are calculated as the present value of expected future dividends,\n<ref name=\"Cochrane & Culp\">Christopher L.

Relatedly, rationality \u2014 in the sense of arbitrage-exploitation \u2014 gives rise to Black\u2013Scholes; option values here ultimately consistent with the CAPM.\n\nIn general, then, while portfolio theory studies how investors should balance risk and return when investing in many assets or securities, the CAPM is more focused, describing how, in equilibrium, markets set the prices of assets in relation to how risky they are.\nImportantly, this result will be independent of the investor's level of risk aversion, and / or assumed utility function, thus providing a readily determined discount rate for corporate finance decision makers [[Financial economics#Certainty|as above]],<ref name=\"Jensen&Smith\">[[Michael C.

The CAPM was derived by [[Jack L. Treynor|Jack Treynor]] (1961, 1962), [[William F. Sharpe]] (1964), [[John Lintner]] (1965) and [[Jan Mossin]] (1966) independently. )\n\nBlack\u2013Scholes provides a mathematical model of a financial market containing [[Derivative (finance)|derivative]] instruments, and the resultant formula for the price of [[option style|European-styled options]].\nThe model is expressed as the Black\u2013Scholes equation, a [[partial differential equation]] describing the changing price of the option over time; it is derived assuming log-normal, [[geometric Brownian motion]] (see [[Brownian model of financial markets]]).\nThe key financial insight behind the model is that one can perfectly hedge the option by buying and selling the underlying asset in just the right way and consequently \"eliminate risk\", absenting the risk adjustment from the pricing (<math>V</math>, the value, or price, of the option, grows at <math>r</math>, the risk-free rate).<ref name=\"Rubinstein\"/><ref name=\"Cochrane & Culp\"/>\nThis hedge, in turn, implies that there is only one right price\u2014in an arbitrage-free sense\u2014for the option. And this price is returned by the Black\u2013Scholes option pricing formula. (The formula, and hence the price, is consistent with the equation, as the formula is [[Partial differential equation#Analytical solutions|the solution]] to the equation.)\nSince the formula is without reference to the share's expected return, Black\u2013Scholes inheres risk neutrality; intuitively consistent with the \"elimination of risk\" here, and mathematically consistent with [[#Arbitrage-free pricing and equilibrium]] above.

As regards [[asset pricing]], developments in equilibrium-based pricing are discussed under \"Portfolio theory\" below, while \"Derivative pricing\" relates to risk-neutral, i.e. arbitrage-free, pricing.  As regards the use of capital, \"Corporate finance theory\" relates, mainly, to the application of these models.\n\n===Portfolio theory===\n[[Image:Pareto Efficient Frontier for the Markowitz Portfolio selection problem..png|thumb|right|200px|Plot of two criteria when maximizing return and minimizing risk in financial portfolios (Pareto-optimal points in red)]]\n[[File:Four Correlations.png|thumb|right|alt=Examples of bivariate copul\u00e6 used in finance.|Examples of bivariate copul\u00e6 used in finance.]]\n:''See also: [[Post-modern portfolio theory]] and {{sectionlink|Mathematical finance|Risk and portfolio management: the P world}}.''\nThe majority of developments here relate to required return, i.e. pricing, extending the basic CAPM. Multi-factor models such as the [[Fama\u2013French three-factor model]] and the [[Carhart four-factor model]], propose factors other than market return as relevant in pricing. The [[intertemporal CAPM]] and [[Consumption-based capital asset pricing model|consumption-based CAPM]] similarly extend the model. With [[intertemporal portfolio choice]], the investor now repeatedly optimizes her portfolio; while the inclusion of [[Consumption (economics)|consumption (in the economic sense)]] then incorporates all sources of wealth, and not just market-based investments, into the investor's calculation of required return.\n\nWhereas the above extend the CAPM, the [[single-index model]] is a more simple model. It assumes, only, a correlation between security and market returns, without (numerous) other economic assumptions. It is useful in that it simplifies the estimation of correlation between securities, significantly reducing the inputs for building the correlation matrix required for portfolio optimization. The [[arbitrage pricing theory]] (APT; [[Stephen Ross (economist)|Stephen Ross]], 1976) similarly differs as regards its assumptions. APT \"gives up the notion that there is one right portfolio for everyone in the world, and ...replaces it with an explanatory model of what drives asset returns.\"<ref>''The Arbitrage Pricing Theory,'' Chapter VI in Goetzmann, under External links.</ref> It returns the required (expected) return of a financial asset as a linear function of various macro-economic factors, and assumes that arbitrage should bring incorrectly priced assets back into line.\n\nAs regards [[portfolio optimization]], the [[Black\u2013Litterman model]] departs from the original [[Markowitz model]] - i.e. of constructing portfolios via an [[efficient frontier]]. Black\u2013Litterman instead starts with an equilibrium assumption, and is then modified to take into account the 'views' (i.e., the specific opinions about asset returns) of the investor in question to arrive at a bespoke asset allocation. Where factors additional to volatility are considered (kurtosis, skew...) then [[multiple-criteria decision analysis]] can be applied; here deriving a [[Pareto efficient]] portfolio. The [[universal portfolio algorithm]] ([[Thomas M. Cover]], 1991) applies [[machine learning]] to asset selection, learning adaptively from historical data.

Various [[Option (finance)#Model implementation|other numeric techniques]] have also been developed. The theoretical framework too has been extended such that [[martingale pricing]] is now the standard approach.\n\nDrawing on these techniques, models for various other underlyings and applications have also been developed, all based off the same logic (using \"[[contingent claim analysis]]\"). [[Real options valuation]] allows that option holders can influence the option's underlying; models for [[Employee stock option#Valuation|employee stock option valuation]] explicitly assume non-rationality on the part of option holders; [[Credit derivative]]s allow that payment obligations and / or delivery requirements might not be honored. [[Exotic derivative]]s are now routinely valued. Multi-asset underlyers are handled via simulation or [[Copula (probability theory)#Quantitative finance|copula based analysis]].\n\nSimilarly, the various [[short rate model]]s allow for an extension of these techniques to [[Fixed income#Derivatives|fixed income-]] and [[interest rate derivative]]s.

(The pattern differs across various markets.) Modelling the volatility smile is an active area of research, and developments here \u2014 as well as implications re the standard theory \u2014 are discussed [[#Departures from normality|in the next section]].\n\nAfter the [[financial crisis of 2007\u20132008]], a further development: ([[Over-the-counter (finance)|over the counter]]) derivative pricing had relied on the BSM risk neutral pricing framework, under the assumptions of funding at the risk free rate and the ability to perfectly replicate cashflows so as to fully hedge. This, in turn, is built on the assumption of a credit-risk-free environment \u2014 called into question during the crisis. \nAddressing this, therefore, issues such as [[counterparty credit risk]], funding costs and costs of capital are now additionally considered when pricing,<ref>[http://pure.au.dk/portal-asb-student/files/96440392/Master_Thesis_Pure.pdf \"Post-Crisis Pricing of Swaps using xVAs\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160917015231/http://pure.au.dk/portal-asb-student/files/96440392/Master_Thesis_Pure.pdf |date=2016-09-17 }}, Christian Kj\u00f8lhede & Anders Bech, Master thesis, [[Aarhus University]]</ref> and a [[Credit Valuation Adjustment]], or CVA\u2014and potentially other ''valuation adjustments'', collectively [[xVA]]\u2014is generally added to the risk-neutral derivative value.\n\nA related, and perhaps more fundamental change, is that discounting is now on the [[Overnight index swap|Overnight Index Swap]] (OIS) curve, as opposed to [[LIBOR]] as used previously. This is because post-crisis, the [[overnight rate]]  is considered a better proxy for the \"risk-free rate\".<ref>{{cite journal |title=LIBOR vs. OIS: The Derivatives Discounting Dilemma |first=John |last=Hull |first2=Alan |last2=White |journal=[[Journal of Investment Management]] |volume=11 |issue=3 |year=2013 |pages=14\u201327}}</ref> (Also, practically, the interest paid on cash [[collateral (finance)|collateral]] is usually the overnight rate; OIS discounting is then, sometimes, referred to as \"[[Credit Support Annex|CSA]] discounting\".) [[Swap (finance)#Valuation|Swap pricing]] - and, therefore, [[yield curve]] construction - is further modified: previously, swaps were valued off a single \"self discounting\" interest rate curve; whereas post crisis, to accommodate OIS discounting, valuation is now under a \"[[multi-curve framework]]\" where \"forecast curves\" are constructed for each floating-leg [[Libor#Maturities|LIBOR tenor]], with discounting on the ''common'' OIS curve.\n\n===Corporate finance theory===\n[[Image:Manual decision tree.jpg|right|thumb|Project valuation via decision tree.]]\nCorporate finance theory has also been extended: mirroring the [[#Certainty|above]] developments, asset-valuation and decisioning no longer need assume \"certainty\". \n[[Monte Carlo methods in finance]] allow financial analysts to construct \"[[stochastic]]\" or [[probabilistic]] corporate finance models, as opposed to the traditional static and [[deterministic]] models;<ref name=\"Damodaran_Risk\"/> see {{sectionlink|Corporate finance|Quantifying uncertainty}}. \nRelatedly, Real Options theory allows for owner\u2014i.e. managerial\u2014actions that impact underlying value: by incorporating option pricing logic, these actions are then applied to a distribution of future outcomes, changing with time, which then determine the \"project's\" valuation today.<ref name=\"Damodaran\"/> \n(Simulation was first applied to (corporate) finance by [[David B.

Empirical evidence, however, suggests that these assumptions may not hold (see [[Kurtosis risk]], [[Skewness risk]], [[Long tail]]) and that in practice, traders, analysts and [[financial risk management|risk managers]] frequently modify the \"standard models\" (see [[Model risk]]). In fact, [[Benoit Mandelbrot]] had discovered already in the 1960s that changes in financial prices do not follow a [[normal distribution]], the basis for much option pricing theory, although this observation was slow to find its way into mainstream financial economics.\n\n[[Financial models with long-tailed distributions and volatility clustering]] have been introduced to overcome problems with the realism of the above \"classical\" financial models; while [[Jump diffusion#In economics and finance|jump diffusion models]] allow for (option) pricing incorporating [[jump process|\"jumps\"]] in the [[spot price]].<ref name=\"holes\">{{cite journal |title=  How to use the holes in Black-Scholes |first= Fischer |last=Black|author-link1=Fischer Black |journal=[[Journal of Applied Corporate Finance]] |volume=1|issue=Jan|year=1989|pages=67\u201373|jstor=|doi=10.1111/j.1745-6622.1989.tb00175.x}}</ref> \nRisk managers, similarly, complement (or substitute) the standard [[value at risk]] models with [[Historical simulation (finance)|historical simulations]], [[Mixture model#A financial model|mixture models]], [[principal component analysis]], [[extreme value theory]], as well as models for [[volatility clustering]].<ref>See for example III.A.3, in Carol Alexander, ed.

In this way calculated prices \u2014 and numeric structures \u2014 are market-consistent in an arbitrage-free sense.  The second approach assumes that the volatility of the underlying price is a stochastic process rather than a constant. Models here are first [[Stochastic volatility#Calibration and estimation|calibrated to observed prices]], and are then applied to the valuation or hedging in question; the most common are [[Heston model|Heston]], [[SABR volatility model|SABR]] and [[Constant elasticity of variance model|CEV]]. This approach addresses certain problems identified with hedging under local volatility.<ref>{{cite journal |title=  Managing smile risk |first= Patrick |last=Hagan |display-authors=etal|journal=[[Wilmott Magazine]] |volume=|issue=Sep|year=2002 |pages=84\u2013108|jstor=|doi=}}</ref>\n\nRelated to local volatility are the [[Lattice model (finance)|lattice]]-based [[Implied binomial tree|implied-binomial]] and [[Implied trinomial tree|-trinomial trees]] \u2014 essentially a discretization of the approach \u2014 which are similarly (but less commonly) used for pricing; these are built on state-prices recovered from the surface. \n[[Edgeworth binomial tree]]s allow for a specified (i.e. non-Gaussian) [[Skewness|skew]] and [[kurtosis]] in the spot price; priced here, options with differing strikes will return differing implied volatilities, and the tree can be calibrated to the smile as required.<ref>See for example Pg 217 of: Jackson, Mary; Mike Staunton (2001).

This is valid as the surface is built on price data relating to fully collateralized positions, and there is therefore no \"[[double counting (accounting)|double counting]]\" of credit risk (etc.) when appending xVA. (Were this not the case, then each counterparty would have its own surface...) \n\nAs mentioned at top, mathematical finance (and particularly [[financial engineering]]) is more concerned with mathematical consistency (and market realities) than compatibility with economic theory, and the above \"extreme event\" approaches, smile-consistent modeling, and valuation adjustments should then be seen in this light. \nRecognizing this, [[James Rickards]], amongst other critics of financial economics, suggests that, instead, the theory needs revisiting almost entirely: \n:\"The  current  system,  based  on  the  idea  that  risk  is  distributed  in  the  shape  of  a  bell  curve,  is  flawed...

The latter is extended to [[agent-based computational economics]], where price is treated as an [[emergent phenomenon]], resulting from the interaction of the various market participants (agents). The [[noisy market hypothesis]] argues that prices can be influenced by speculators and [[momentum trader]]s, as well as by [[insider trading|insiders]] and institutions that often buy and sell stocks for reasons unrelated to [[fundamental value]]; see [[Noise (economic)]]. The [[adaptive market hypothesis]] is an attempt to reconcile the efficient market hypothesis with behavioral economics, by applying the principles of [[evolution]] to financial interactions. An [[information cascade]], alternatively, shows market participants engaging in the same acts as others (\"[[herd behavior]]\"), despite contradictions with their private information. [[Copula (probability theory)#Quantitative finance|Copula-based modelling]] has similarly been applied. See also [[Hyman Minsky]]'s [[Hyman_Minsky#Minsky's_financial_instability-hypothesis|\"financial instability hypothesis\"]], as well as [[George Soros]]' approach under [[George Soros#Reflexivity, financial markets, and economic theory|\u00a7 Reflexivity, financial markets, and economic theory]].\n\nVarious studies have shown that despite these departures from efficiency, asset prices do typically exhibit a random walk and that one cannot therefore consistently outperform market averages (attain [[Alpha (investment)|\"alpha\"]]).<ref>[[William F.
