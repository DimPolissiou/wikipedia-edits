The National Committee also has \"Regional Representatives\", some of whom are appointed by delegate caucuses at the national convention whereas others are appointed by the chairpersons of LP state affiliate chapters within a region.<ref name=PGPOSA-vol2>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ovKfDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA498|title=\nPolitical Groups, Parties, and Organizations that Shaped America: An Encyclopedia and Document Collection|last=Ainsworth|first=Scott H.|last2=Harward|first2=Brian M.|publisher=[[ABC-CLIO]]|date=July 19, 2019|accessdate=September 23, 2019|volume=2|page=498|isbn=978-1-4408-5196-4}}</ref>\n\n=== Libertarian National Committee ===\nThe [[Libertarian National Committee]] (LNC)<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.lp.org/organization/lncdirectory2.shtml|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011212927/http://www.lp.org/organization/lncdirectory2.shtml|url-status=dead|title=Libertarian Party National Committee|archivedate=October 11, 2007}}</ref> is a 27-member body including alternates, or 17 voting members and is currently chaired by [[Nicholas Sarwark]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.lp.org/libertarian-national-committee/|title=Libertarian National Committee (LNC) - Libertarian Party|website=Lp.org|accessdate=June 21, 2018}}</ref> The LNC is responsible for overseeing day-to-day operations of the Libertarian Party and its national office and staff.

Each state affiliate has a governing committee, usually consisting of statewide officers elected by state party members and regional representation of one kind or another. Similarly, county, town, city and ward committees, where organized, generally consist of members elected at the local level. State and local committees often coordinate campaign activities within their jurisdiction, oversee local conventions and in some cases primaries or caucuses and may have a role in nominating candidates for elected office under state law.\n\n=== Membership ===\nSince the Libertarian Party's inception, individuals have been able to join the party as voting members by signing their agreement with the organization's [[Libertarian pledge|membership pledge]], which states that the signer does not advocate the initiation of force to achieve political or social goals. During the mid-1980s and into the early 1990s, this membership category was called an \"instant\" membership, but currently, these are referred to as \"signature members\". People joining the party are also asked to pay dues, which are on a sliding scale starting at $25 per year. Lifetime membership is granted with a $1,500 donation in one calendar year. Dues-paying members receive a subscription to the party's national newspaper, ''LP News''.<ref>{{ISSN|8755-1373}}</ref> Since 2006, membership in the party's state affiliates has been separate from membership in the national party,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://lpar.org/help/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120221021341/http://lpar.org/help/|url-status=dead|title=Help the LPAR \u00ab Libertarian Party of Arkansas|archivedate=February 21, 2012}}</ref> with each state chapter maintaining its own membership rolls.\n\nMost rights to participate in the governance of the party are limited to \"bylaws-sustaining members\" who have either purchased a lifetime membership or donated at least $25 within the past year. Most state parties maintain separate membership, which may be tied to either payment of dues to the state party, or voter registration as a Libertarian, depending on the state's election laws.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lp.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/2016_LP_Bylaws_and_Convention_Rules_w_2016_JC_Rules.pdf|title=Bylaws|date=2016|website=lp.org}}</ref>\n\n== Platform ==\n{{Duplication|section=yes|dupe=#Political positions|date=September 2019}}\nThe preamble outlines the party's goals: \"As Libertarians, we seek a world of liberty; a world in which all individuals are sovereign over their own lives and no one is forced to sacrifice his or her values for the benefit of others. [...] Our goal is nothing more nor less than a world set free in our lifetime, and it is to this end that we take these stands\". Its Statement of Principles begins: \"We, the members of the Libertarian Party, challenge the cult of the omnipotent state and defend the rights of the individual\". The Statement of Principles is foundational to the ideology of the party and was created specifically to bind the party to certain core principles with a high parliamentary burden for any amendment.<ref>{{cite web |last = Ann |first = Caryn |url = http://www.independentpoliticalreport.com/2015/09/d-frank-robinson-the-libertarian-party-statement-of-principles/ |title = D.

The party opposes [[gun control]]. It calls for [[United States Constitution|Constitutional]] limitations on government as well as the elimination of most state functions. It includes a \"Self-determination\" section which quotes from the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] and reads: \"Whenever any form of government becomes destructive of individual liberty, it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it, and to agree to such new governance as to them shall seem most likely to protect their liberty\". It also includes an \"Omissions\" section which reads: \"Our silence about any other particular government law, regulation, ordinance, directive, edict, control, regulatory agency, activity, or machination should not be construed to imply approval\".<ref name=platform/>\n\nThe party favors minimally regulated markets, a less powerful [[federal government]], strong [[civil liberties]] (including [[LGBT rights]], with the party supporting [[same-sex marriage]]), the [[drug liberalization|liberalization of drug laws]], [[separation of church and state]], [[open immigration]], [[non-interventionism]] and [[neutrality (international relations)|neutrality]] in diplomatic relations, [[free trade]] and [[freedom of movement|free movement]] to all foreign countries and a more representative republic.<ref name=platform>{{cite web |url = http://www.lp.org/platform |title= Libertarian Party: Platform |publisher = Libertarian Party |access-date = June 6, 2012 }}</ref> The party's position on abortion is that government should stay out of the matter and leave it to the individual, but recognizes that some \"good-faith\" opinions on this issue are different.<ref name=\"abortion1.4\">{{cite web |work = Platform |url = http://www.lp.org/platform |title = 1.4 Abortion |publisher = Libertarian Party |access-date = March 8, 2013 }}</ref> [[Ron Paul]], one of the former presidential nominees of the Libertarian Party in 1988, is strictly [[anti-abortion]].

Since its founding, the party has apportioned delegate seats to its national convention based on the number of members in each state who have paid minimum dues (with additional delegates given to state affiliates for good performance in winning more votes than normal for the party's presidential candidate). This is the most-used number by party activists. As of December 2017, the Libertarian Party reported that there were 14,445 donating members.<ref name=\"hq.lp.org\"/>\n\nHistorically, dues were $15 throughout the 1980s and in 1991 they were increased to $25. Between February 1, 2006, and the close of the 2006 Libertarian party convention on May 31, 2006, dues were set to $0.<ref name=\"LNC Approves Zero Dues\">\"[http://www.lp.org/lpnews/article_769.shtml LNC Approves Zero Dues]\", ''LP News'', September 1, 2005.

C., five times. That level of ballot access has only been achieved by a third-party candidate four other times ([[John B. Anderson|John Anderson]] in 1980, [[Lenora Fulani]] in 1988, and [[Ross Perot]] in 1992 and 1996.) Although the territory of [[Guam]] has no electoral votes, it began holding presidential elections in 1980. The Libertarian Party presidential candidate appeared on the ballot in Guam in every election from 1980 through 2012. Anderson and Fulani were also on the ballot in Guam.<ref>{{cite web|author=Guam Election Commission|url=https://gec.guam.gov/index.php/about-the-gec/reports-studies-publications|title=Reports, Studies & Publications|publisher=Gec.guam.gov|accessdate=June 21, 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe following is a table comparison of ballot status for the Libertarian Party presidential nominee from 1972 to 2016.

modern [[welfare state]]. It adopts pro-[[civil liberties]] and pro-[[cultural liberalism|cultural liberal]] approaches to cultural and social issues. Paul H. Rubin, professor of law and economics at [[Emory University]], believes that while [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]] [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] generally seek to control economic activities and [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] generally seek to control consumption activities such as sexual behavior, abortion and so on, the Libertarian Party is the largest political party in the United States that advocates few or no regulations in what he deems \"social\" and \"economic\" issues.<ref>{{cite book |title = Darwinian politics: The Evolutionary Origin of Freedom |first = Paul H. |last = Rubin |year = 2002 |publisher = [[Rutgers University Press]] |isbn = 978-0-8135-3096-3 |page = 130 |url = https://books.google.com/?id=qZ1mSn7BoLMC&pg=PA130 }}</ref>\n\n=== Economic issues ===\nThe \"poverty and welfare\" issues page of the Libertarian Party's website says that it opposes [[Regulatory economics|regulation]] of capitalist [[Institutional economics|economic institutions]] and advocates dismantling the entirety of the welfare state: <blockquote>We should eliminate the entire social welfare system. This includes eliminating food stamps, subsidized housing, and all the rest. Individuals who are unable to fully support themselves and their families through the job market must, once again, learn to rely on supportive family, church, community, or private charity to bridge the gap.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web |url = https://www.lp.org/issues/poverty-and-welfare |title = Poverty and Welfare |publisher = Libertarian Party |access-date = May 17, 2016 |url-status = dead |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160504174949/http://www.lp.org/issues/poverty-and-welfare |archivedate = May 4, 2016 |df = mdy-all }}</ref></blockquote>According to the party platform: \"The only proper role of government in the economic realm is to protect property rights, adjudicate disputes, and provide a legal framework in which voluntary trade is protected\" (adopted May 2008).<ref name=\"lp\">{{cite web|url=http://www.lp.org/issues/current-issues|title=Current Issues|publisher=Libertarian Party|accessdate=May 5, 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150507012119/http://www.lp.org/issues/current-issues|archivedate=May 7, 2015|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe Libertarian Party believes [[Economic regulation#Criticism of economic regulation|government regulations]] in the form of [[minimum wage law]]s drive up the [[Minimum wage#Debate over consequences|cost of employing additional workers]].<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.lp.org/issues/poverty-and-welfare |title = Poverty and Welfare |publisher = Libertarian Party |access-date = May 5, 2015 |url-status = dead |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150511125038/http://www.lp.org/issues/poverty-and-welfare |archivedate = May 11, 2015 |df = mdy-all }}</ref> That is why Libertarians favor loosening minimum wage laws so that overall [[Economy of the United States#Employment|unemployment rate]] can be reduced and low-wage workers, unskilled workers, [[Immigration to the United States|visa immigrants]] and those with limited education or job experience can find employment.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ca.lp.org/lp20090420.shtml|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100113063659/http://www.ca.lp.org/lp20090420.shtml|url-status=dead|title=Time to Tax Sacramento with Tough Love|archivedate=January 13, 2010}}</ref>\n\n==== Education ====\nThe party supports ending the [[Education in the United States|public school system]].<ref>{{cite web |url = https://www.lp.org/platform#2.9 |title = Platform|publisher = Libertarian Party |access-date = July 29, 2016 }}</ref> The party's official platform states that education is best provided by the free market, achieving greater quality, accountability and efficiency with more diversity of [[school choice]]. Seeing the education of children as a parental responsibility, the party would give authority to parents to determine the education of their children at their expense without interference from government. This includes ending [[School corporal punishment in the United States|corporal punishment]] within [[State school|public schools]]. Libertarians have expressed that parents should have control of and responsibility for all funds expended for their children's education.<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite web |url = http://www.lp.org/platform |title = Platform|publisher = Libertarian Party |access-date = January 29, 2016 }}</ref>\n\n==== Environment ====\n{{see also|Free-market environmentalism}}\nThe Libertarian Party supports a clean and healthy environment and sensible use of [[natural resources]], believing that private landowners and conservation groups have a vested interest in maintaining such natural resources.<ref name=platform /> The party has also expressed that \"governments, unlike private businesses, are unaccountable for such damage done to the environment and have a terrible track record when it comes to environmental protection\".<ref name=\"Platform\">{{cite web |url = http://www.lp.org/platform |title = Platform|publisher = Libertarian Party |access-date = May 5, 2015 }}</ref> The party contends that the environment is best protected when individual rights pertaining to natural resources are clearly defined and enforced. The party also contends that [[free market]]s and [[Property rights (economics)|property rights]] (implicitly without government intervention) will stimulate the technological innovations and behavioral changes required to protect the environment and ecosystem because environmental advocates and [[social pressure]] are the most effective means of changing public behavior.<ref name=\"Platform\"/>\n\n==== Fiscal policies ====\nThe Libertarian Party opposes all government intervention and regulation on wages, [[price]]s, [[Renting|rents]], [[Profit (accounting)|profits]], production and [[interest rate]]s and advocate the repeal of all laws banning or restricting the advertising of [[price]]s, products, or services. The party's recent platform calls for the repeal of the [[income tax]], the abolition of the [[Internal Revenue Service]] and all federal programs and services, such as the [[Federal Reserve System]]. The party supports the passage of a [[Balanced Budget Amendment]] to the Constitution which they believe will significantly lower the [[National debt of the United States|national debt]], provided that the budget is balanced preferably by cutting expenditures and not by raising taxes. Libertarians favor free-market banking, with unrestricted competition among banks and depository institutions of all types. The party also wants a halt to [[inflationary]] monetary policies and legal tender laws. While the party defends the right of individuals to form corporations, cooperatives and other types of companies, it opposes government [[subsidies]] to business, labor, or any other [[special interest]].<ref name=\"Platform\" />\n\n==== Healthcare ====\nThe Libertarian Party favors a [[Free-market healthcare|free market health care]] system without government oversight, approval, regulation, or licensing. The party states that it \"recognizes the freedom of individuals to determine the level of [[health insurance]] they can afford (if any), the amount of health care they can afford, the care providers they can afford, the medicines and treatments they can use and all other aspects of their [[medical care]], including the many end-of-life decisions that will follow\". They support the repeal of all social insurance policies such as [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] and [[Medicaid]] and favor \"consumer-driven health care\".<ref>{{cite press release |url = https://www.lp.org/news/press-releases/libertarian-party-opposes-health-care-plan |date = March 19, 2010 |title = Libertarian Party opposes health care plan |publisher = Libertarian Party |access-date = August 2, 2016 }}</ref> The Libertarian Party has been advocating for Americans' ability to purchase health insurance across state lines.\n\n==== Immigration and trade agreements ====\nThe Libertarian Party consistently lobbies for the removal of governmental impediments to free trade. This is because their platform states that \"political freedom and escape from tyranny demand that individuals not be unreasonably constrained by government in the crossing of political boundaries\".<ref name=\"lp.org\">{{cite web |url = https://www.lp.org/platform |title = Platform|publisher = Libertarian Party |access-date = May 5, 2015 }}</ref> To promote economic freedom, they demand the unrestricted movement of humans as well as financial capital across national borders.

The party supports the right of free persons to associate or not associate in [[Trade union|labor unions]] and believes that employers should have the right to recognize or refuse to recognize a union.<ref name=\"Platform\"/>\n\n==== Retirement and Social Security ====\nThe party believes that retirement planning is the responsibility of the individual, not the government. Libertarians would phase out the current government-sponsored [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] system and transition to a [[Privatization|private]] voluntary system. The Libertarians feel that the proper and most effective source of help for the poor is the voluntary efforts of [[Charitable organization|private groups]] and individuals, believing members of society will become more charitable and civil society will be strengthened as government reduces its activity in that realm.<ref name=\"Platform\" />\n\n=== Social issues ===\nThe Libertarian Party supports the legalization of all [[victimless crimes]],<ref name=\"http://www.lp.org/platform\">{{cite web|url=http://www.lp.org/platform|title=Platform &#124; Libertarian Party|publisher=Libertarian Party|date=|accessdate=January 29, 2016}}</ref> including [[Recreational drug use|drugs]],<ref name=\"Eagles Johnston\">{{cite book|title=Politics: An Introduction to Modern Democratic Government|last1=Eagles|first1=Munroe|last2=Johnston|first2=Larry|year=2008|publisher=[[University of Toronto Press]]|isbn=978-1-55111-858-1|page=110|url=https://books.google.com/?id=uw9BHYRdtsAC&pg=PA110}}</ref><ref name=\"Libertarian struggle\">{{cite news|first=Karin|last=Miller|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=uOwjAAAAIBAJ&sjid=xewDAAAAIBAJ&pg=6583,6407110&dq=prostitution+libertarian-party&hl=en|title=Libertarian struggle to be taken seriously in presidential race|work=[[Deseret News]]|agency=Associated Press|date=September 12\u201313, 1996}}</ref><ref name=\"Co-founder\">{{cite news|first=Emma|last=Brown|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/11/23/AR2010112306604.html|title=Co-founder of national Libertarian Party|work=[[The Washington Post]]|date=November 24, 2010}}</ref><ref name=\"GALLOWAY Libertarian\">{{cite news|first=Angela|last=Galloway|url=http://www.seattlepi.com/default/article/For-Libertarians-winning-is-a-work-in-progress-1155744.php |title = For Libertarians, winning is a work in progress|work=[[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]]|date=October 3, 2004}}</ref> [[Libertarian Party (United States)#Pornography|pornography]],<ref name=\"Eagles Johnston\"/> [[Libertarian Party (United States)#Prostitution|prostitution]],<ref name=\"Eagles Johnston\"/><ref name=\"Libertarian struggle\"/><ref name=\"Co-founder\"/><ref name=\"GALLOWAY Libertarian\"/> [[polygamy]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.azlp.org/platform.php|publisher=Arizona Libertarian Party|title=Home|accessdate=May 5, 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150503140844/http://www.azlp.org/platform.php|archivedate=May 3, 2015|df=mdy-all}}</ref> and [[gambling]],<ref>{{cite book|title=Understanding American Government and Politics|first=Duncan|last=Watts|year=2006|publisher=[[Manchester University Press]]|isbn=978-0-7190-7327-4|page=246|url=https://books.google.com/?id=SIeIARfRc1AC&pg=RA2-PT124}}</ref> supports the removal of restrictions on [[Libertarian Party (United States)#LGBT issues|homosexuality]],<ref name=\"Co-founder\"/> opposes any kind of [[censorship]] and supports [[freedom of speech]],<ref name=\"Freedom of Speech\">{{cite web|url=http://www.lp.org/issues/freedom-of-speech|title=Freedom of Speech|publisher=Libertarian Party|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514110414/http://www.lp.org/issues/freedom-of-speech|archivedate=May 14, 2011|df=mdy-all}}</ref> and supports the [[right to keep and bear arms]]<ref name=\"Libertarian struggle\"/> while opposing Federal capital punishment.<ref name=\"ontheissues.org\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ontheissues.org/Celeb/Libertarian_Party_Crime.htm|title=Libertarian Party on Crime|work=OnTheIssues.org|date=|accessdate=January 29, 2016}}</ref> The Libertarian Party's platform states: \"Government does not have the authority to define, license or restrict [[personal relationship]]s.

Some, like the group [[Libertarians for Life]], consider abortion to be an act of aggression from the government or mother against a fetus. Others, like the group Pro-Choice Libertarians, consider denying a woman the right to choose abortion to be an act of aggression from the government against her.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pro-choicelibertarians.net/|title=Pro-Choice Libertarians|accessdate=July 12, 2012}}</ref>\n\n==== Crime and capital punishment ====\n{{see also|Libertarian perspectives on capital punishment}}\nShortly before the [[2000 United States presidential election|2000 elections]], the party released a \"Libertarian Party Program on Crime\" in which they criticize the failures of a recently proposed Omnibus Crime Bill, especially detailing how it expands the list of [[capital crime]]s.<ref name=\"ontheissues.org\"/> Denouncing Federal executions, they also describe how the party would increase and safeguard the [[rights of the accused]] in legal settings as well as limit the use of [[excessive force]] by police. Instead, criminal laws would be reduced to violations of the rights of others through either force or fraud with maximum [[restitution]] given to victims of the criminals or negligent persons.<ref name=\"lp.org\"/> In 2016, the party expanded their platform to officially support the repeal of capital punishment.<ref name=\"http://www.lp.org/platform#1.8\">[http://www.lp.org/platform#1.8 \"2016 platform\"].</ref>\n\n==== Freedom of speech and censorship ====\nThe Libertarian Party supports unrestricted freedom of speech and is opposed to any kind of [[censorship]]. The party describes the issue in its website: \"We defend the rights of individuals to unrestricted freedom of speech, [[freedom of the press]] and the right of individuals to [[dissent]] from government itself. [...] We oppose any abridgment of the freedom of speech through government censorship, regulation or control of communications media\". The party claims it is the only political party in the United States \"with an explicit stand against censorship of computer communications in its platform\".<ref name=\"Freedom of Speech\"/>\n\n==== Government reform ====\nThe Libertarian Party favors election systems that are more representative of the [[Electoral district|electorate]] at the [[United States federal government|federal]], state and [[local government|local]] levels.

The proposal was incorporated in a new party-wide strategic plan and a joint platform-program committee proposed a reformatted project platform that isolated talking points on issues, principles and solutions as well as an array of projects for adaptation. This platform, along with a short Summary for talking points, was approved in 2004.

Each state affiliate has a governing committee, usually consisting of statewide officers elected by state party members and regional representation of one kind or another. Similarly, county, town, city and ward committees, where organized, generally consist of members elected at the local level. State and local committees often coordinate campaign activities within their jurisdiction, oversee local conventions and in some cases primaries or caucuses and may have a role in nominating candidates for elected office under state law.\n\n=== Membership ===\nSince the Libertarian Party's inception, individuals have been able to join the party as voting members by signing their agreement with the organization's [[Libertarian pledge|membership pledge]], which states that the signer does not advocate the initiation of force to achieve political or social goals. During the mid-1980s and into the early 1990s, this membership category was called an \"instant\" membership, but currently, these are referred to as \"signature members\". People joining the party are also asked to pay dues, which are on a sliding scale starting at $25 per year. Lifetime membership is granted with a $1,500 donation in one calendar year.

[...] Our goal is nothing more nor less than a world set free in our lifetime, and it is to this end that we take these stands\". Its Statement of Principles begins: \"We, the members of the Libertarian Party, challenge the cult of the omnipotent state and defend the rights of the individual\". The Statement of Principles is foundational to the ideology of the party and was created specifically to bind the party to certain core principles with a high parliamentary burden for any amendment.<ref>{{cite web |last = Ann |first = Caryn |url = http://www.independentpoliticalreport.com/2015/09/d-frank-robinson-the-libertarian-party-statement-of-principles/ |title = D.

The party opposes [[gun control]]. It calls for [[United States Constitution|Constitutional]] limitations on government as well as the elimination of most state functions. It includes a \"Self-determination\" section which quotes from the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] and reads: \"Whenever any form of government becomes destructive of individual liberty, it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it, and to agree to such new governance as to them shall seem most likely to protect their liberty\". It also includes an \"Omissions\" section which reads: \"Our silence about any other particular government law, regulation, ordinance, directive, edict, control, regulatory agency, activity, or machination should not be construed to imply approval\".<ref name=platform/>\n\nThe party favors minimally regulated markets, a less powerful [[federal government]], strong [[civil liberties]] (including [[LGBT rights]], with the party supporting [[same-sex marriage]]), the [[drug liberalization|liberalization of drug laws]], [[separation of church and state]], [[open immigration]], [[non-interventionism]] and [[neutrality (international relations)|neutrality]] in diplomatic relations, [[free trade]] and [[freedom of movement|free movement]] to all foreign countries and a more representative republic.<ref name=platform>{{cite web |url = http://www.lp.org/platform |title= Libertarian Party: Platform |publisher = Libertarian Party |access-date = June 6, 2012 }}</ref> The party's position on abortion is that government should stay out of the matter and leave it to the individual, but recognizes that some \"good-faith\" opinions on this issue are different.<ref name=\"abortion1.4\">{{cite web |work = Platform |url = http://www.lp.org/platform |title = 1.4 Abortion |publisher = Libertarian Party |access-date = March 8, 2013 }}</ref> [[Ron Paul]], one of the former presidential nominees of the Libertarian Party in 1988, is strictly [[anti-abortion]].

modern [[welfare state]]. It adopts pro-[[civil liberties]] and pro-[[cultural liberalism|cultural liberal]] approaches to cultural and social issues. Paul H. Rubin, professor of law and economics at [[Emory University]], believes that while [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]] [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] generally seek to control economic activities and [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] generally seek to control consumption activities such as sexual behavior, abortion and so on, the Libertarian Party is the largest political party in the United States that advocates few or no regulations in what he deems \"social\" and \"economic\" issues.<ref>{{cite book |title = Darwinian politics: The Evolutionary Origin of Freedom |first = Paul H. |last = Rubin |year = 2002 |publisher = [[Rutgers University Press]] |isbn = 978-0-8135-3096-3 |page = 130 |url = https://books.google.com/?id=qZ1mSn7BoLMC&pg=PA130 }}</ref>\n\n=== Economic issues ===\nThe \"poverty and welfare\" issues page of the Libertarian Party's website says that it opposes [[Regulatory economics|regulation]] of capitalist [[Institutional economics|economic institutions]] and advocates dismantling the entirety of the welfare state: <blockquote>We should eliminate the entire social welfare system. This includes eliminating food stamps, subsidized housing, and all the rest.

Seeing the education of children as a parental responsibility, the party would give authority to parents to determine the education of their children at their expense without interference from government. This includes ending [[School corporal punishment in the United States|corporal punishment]] within [[State school|public schools]]. Libertarians have expressed that parents should have control of and responsibility for all funds expended for their children's education.<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite web |url = http://www.lp.org/platform |title = Platform|publisher = Libertarian Party |access-date = January 29, 2016 }}</ref>\n\n==== Environment ====\n{{see also|Free-market environmentalism}}\nThe Libertarian Party supports a clean and healthy environment and sensible use of [[natural resources]], believing that private landowners and conservation groups have a vested interest in maintaining such natural resources.<ref name=platform /> The party has also expressed that \"governments, unlike private businesses, are unaccountable for such damage done to the environment and have a terrible track record when it comes to environmental protection\".<ref name=\"Platform\">{{cite web |url = http://www.lp.org/platform |title = Platform|publisher = Libertarian Party |access-date = May 5, 2015 }}</ref> The party contends that the environment is best protected when individual rights pertaining to natural resources are clearly defined and enforced. The party also contends that [[free market]]s and [[Property rights (economics)|property rights]] (implicitly without government intervention) will stimulate the technological innovations and behavioral changes required to protect the environment and ecosystem because environmental advocates and [[social pressure]] are the most effective means of changing public behavior.<ref name=\"Platform\"/>\n\n==== Fiscal policies ====\nThe Libertarian Party opposes all government intervention and regulation on wages, [[price]]s, [[Renting|rents]], [[Profit (accounting)|profits]], production and [[interest rate]]s and advocate the repeal of all laws banning or restricting the advertising of [[price]]s, products, or services. The party's recent platform calls for the repeal of the [[income tax]], the abolition of the [[Internal Revenue Service]] and all federal programs and services, such as the [[Federal Reserve System]]. The party supports the passage of a [[Balanced Budget Amendment]] to the Constitution which they believe will significantly lower the [[National debt of the United States|national debt]], provided that the budget is balanced preferably by cutting expenditures and not by raising taxes. Libertarians favor free-market banking, with unrestricted competition among banks and depository institutions of all types. The party also wants a halt to [[inflationary]] monetary policies and legal tender laws. While the party defends the right of individuals to form corporations, cooperatives and other types of companies, it opposes government [[subsidies]] to business, labor, or any other [[special interest]].<ref name=\"Platform\" />\n\n==== Healthcare ====\nThe Libertarian Party favors a [[Free-market healthcare|free market health care]] system without government oversight, approval, regulation, or licensing. The party states that it \"recognizes the freedom of individuals to determine the level of [[health insurance]] they can afford (if any), the amount of health care they can afford, the care providers they can afford, the medicines and treatments they can use and all other aspects of their [[medical care]], including the many end-of-life decisions that will follow\". They support the repeal of all social insurance policies such as [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] and [[Medicaid]] and favor \"consumer-driven health care\".<ref>{{cite press release |url = https://www.lp.org/news/press-releases/libertarian-party-opposes-health-care-plan |date = March 19, 2010 |title = Libertarian Party opposes health care plan |publisher = Libertarian Party |access-date = August 2, 2016 }}</ref> The Libertarian Party has been advocating for Americans' ability to purchase health insurance across state lines.\n\n==== Immigration and trade agreements ====\nThe Libertarian Party consistently lobbies for the removal of governmental impediments to free trade. This is because their platform states that \"political freedom and escape from tyranny demand that individuals not be unreasonably constrained by government in the crossing of political boundaries\".<ref name=\"lp.org\">{{cite web |url = https://www.lp.org/platform |title = Platform|publisher = Libertarian Party |access-date = May 5, 2015 }}</ref> To promote economic freedom, they demand the unrestricted movement of humans as well as financial capital across national borders.

The party supports the right of free persons to associate or not associate in [[Trade union|labor unions]] and believes that employers should have the right to recognize or refuse to recognize a union.<ref name=\"Platform\"/>\n\n==== Retirement and Social Security ====\nThe party believes that retirement planning is the responsibility of the individual, not the government. Libertarians would phase out the current government-sponsored [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] system and transition to a [[Privatization|private]] voluntary system. The Libertarians feel that the proper and most effective source of help for the poor is the voluntary efforts of [[Charitable organization|private groups]] and individuals, believing members of society will become more charitable and civil society will be strengthened as government reduces its activity in that realm.<ref name=\"Platform\" />\n\n=== Social issues ===\nThe Libertarian Party supports the legalization of all [[victimless crimes]],<ref name=\"http://www.lp.org/platform\">{{cite web|url=http://www.lp.org/platform|title=Platform &#124; Libertarian Party|publisher=Libertarian Party|date=|accessdate=January 29, 2016}}</ref> including [[Recreational drug use|drugs]],<ref name=\"Eagles Johnston\">{{cite book|title=Politics: An Introduction to Modern Democratic Government|last1=Eagles|first1=Munroe|last2=Johnston|first2=Larry|year=2008|publisher=[[University of Toronto Press]]|isbn=978-1-55111-858-1|page=110|url=https://books.google.com/?id=uw9BHYRdtsAC&pg=PA110}}</ref><ref name=\"Libertarian struggle\">{{cite news|first=Karin|last=Miller|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=uOwjAAAAIBAJ&sjid=xewDAAAAIBAJ&pg=6583,6407110&dq=prostitution+libertarian-party&hl=en|title=Libertarian struggle to be taken seriously in presidential race|work=[[Deseret News]]|agency=Associated Press|date=September 12\u201313, 1996}}</ref><ref name=\"Co-founder\">{{cite news|first=Emma|last=Brown|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/11/23/AR2010112306604.html|title=Co-founder of national Libertarian Party|work=[[The Washington Post]]|date=November 24, 2010}}</ref><ref name=\"GALLOWAY Libertarian\">{{cite news|first=Angela|last=Galloway|url=http://www.seattlepi.com/default/article/For-Libertarians-winning-is-a-work-in-progress-1155744.php |title = For Libertarians, winning is a work in progress|work=[[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]]|date=October 3, 2004}}</ref> [[Libertarian Party (United States)#Pornography|pornography]],<ref name=\"Eagles Johnston\"/> [[Libertarian Party (United States)#Prostitution|prostitution]],<ref name=\"Eagles Johnston\"/><ref name=\"Libertarian struggle\"/><ref name=\"Co-founder\"/><ref name=\"GALLOWAY Libertarian\"/> [[polygamy]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.azlp.org/platform.php|publisher=Arizona Libertarian Party|title=Home|accessdate=May 5, 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150503140844/http://www.azlp.org/platform.php|archivedate=May 3, 2015|df=mdy-all}}</ref> and [[gambling]],<ref>{{cite book|title=Understanding American Government and Politics|first=Duncan|last=Watts|year=2006|publisher=[[Manchester University Press]]|isbn=978-0-7190-7327-4|page=246|url=https://books.google.com/?id=SIeIARfRc1AC&pg=RA2-PT124}}</ref> supports the removal of restrictions on [[Libertarian Party (United States)#LGBT issues|homosexuality]],<ref name=\"Co-founder\"/> opposes any kind of [[censorship]] and supports [[freedom of speech]],<ref name=\"Freedom of Speech\">{{cite web|url=http://www.lp.org/issues/freedom-of-speech|title=Freedom of Speech|publisher=Libertarian Party|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514110414/http://www.lp.org/issues/freedom-of-speech|archivedate=May 14, 2011|df=mdy-all}}</ref> and supports the [[right to keep and bear arms]]<ref name=\"Libertarian struggle\"/> while opposing Federal capital punishment.<ref name=\"ontheissues.org\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ontheissues.org/Celeb/Libertarian_Party_Crime.htm|title=Libertarian Party on Crime|work=OnTheIssues.org|date=|accessdate=January 29, 2016}}</ref> The Libertarian Party's platform states: \"Government does not have the authority to define, license or restrict [[personal relationship]]s.

Some, like the group [[Libertarians for Life]], consider abortion to be an act of aggression from the government or mother against a fetus. Others, like the group Pro-Choice Libertarians, consider denying a woman the right to choose abortion to be an act of aggression from the government against her.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pro-choicelibertarians.net/|title=Pro-Choice Libertarians|accessdate=July 12, 2012}}</ref>\n\n==== Crime and capital punishment ====\n{{see also|Libertarian perspectives on capital punishment}}\nShortly before the [[2000 United States presidential election|2000 elections]], the party released a \"Libertarian Party Program on Crime\" in which they criticize the failures of a recently proposed Omnibus Crime Bill, especially detailing how it expands the list of [[capital crime]]s.<ref name=\"ontheissues.org\"/> Denouncing Federal executions, they also describe how the party would increase and safeguard the [[rights of the accused]] in legal settings as well as limit the use of [[excessive force]] by police. Instead, criminal laws would be reduced to violations of the rights of others through either force or fraud with maximum [[restitution]] given to victims of the criminals or negligent persons.<ref name=\"lp.org\"/> In 2016, the party expanded their platform to officially support the repeal of capital punishment.<ref name=\"http://www.lp.org/platform#1.8\">[http://www.lp.org/platform#1.8 \"2016 platform\"].</ref>\n\n==== Freedom of speech and censorship ====\nThe Libertarian Party supports unrestricted freedom of speech and is opposed to any kind of [[censorship]]. The party describes the issue in its website: \"We defend the rights of individuals to unrestricted freedom of speech, [[freedom of the press]] and the right of individuals to [[dissent]] from government itself. [...] We oppose any abridgment of the freedom of speech through government censorship, regulation or control of communications media\". The party claims it is the only political party in the United States \"with an explicit stand against censorship of computer communications in its platform\".<ref name=\"Freedom of Speech\"/>\n\n==== Government reform ====\nThe Libertarian Party favors election systems that are more representative of the [[Electoral district|electorate]] at the [[United States federal government|federal]], state and [[local government|local]] levels. The party platform calls for an end to any tax-financed subsidies to candidates or parties and the repeal of all laws which restrict voluntary financing of election campaigns. As a [[minor party]], it opposes laws that effectively exclude alternative candidates and parties, deny [[ballot access]], [[gerrymander]] districts, or deny the voters their right to consider all legitimate alternatives. Libertarians also promote the use of [[direct democracy]] through the [[referendum]] and [[recall election|recall]] processes.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\n==== LGBT issues ====\nThe Libertarian Party advocates repealing all laws that control or prohibit homosexuality.<ref name=calp>{{Cite web|url=http://ca.lp.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Platform-of-the-Libertarian-Party-of-California-as-amended-in-Convention-March-3-2012.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150403014848/http://ca.lp.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Platform-of-the-Libertarian-Party-of-California-as-amended-in-Convention-March-3-2012.pdf|url-status=dead|title=Platform of the Libertarian Party of California as amended in Convention March 3, 2012|archivedate=April 3, 2015}}</ref> According to the Libertarian Party's platform: \"Sexual orientation, preference, gender, or gender identity should have no impact on the government's treatment of individuals, such as in current marriage, child custody, adoption, immigration or military service laws\".<ref name=Platform/>\n\nGay activist Richard Sincere has pointed to the longstanding support of gay rights by the party, which has supported [[same-sex marriage]] since its first platform was drafted in 1972 (40 years before the Democratic Party adopted same-sex marriage into their platform in 2012).

The proposal was incorporated in a new party-wide strategic plan and a joint platform-program committee proposed a reformatted project platform that isolated talking points on issues, principles and solutions as well as an array of projects for adaptation. This platform, along with a short Summary for talking points, was approved in 2004. Confusion arose when prior to the 2006 convention there was a push to repeal or substantially rewrite the Platform, at the center of which were groups such as the Libertarian Reform Caucus.<ref>\"[http://www.reformthelp.org/  Victory in Portland!

Campbell also cited [[Robert Christgau]], who described dance-oriented rock (or DOR) as an umbrella term used by various DJs in the 1980s.<ref>{{cite book|last=Campbell|first=Michael|year=2008|title=Popular Music in America: And the Beat Goes On|publisher=Cengage Learning|page=359|isbn=978-0-495-50530-3}}</ref>\n\nHowever, [[AllMusic]] defines \"dance-rock\" as 1980s and 1990s music practiced by rock musicians, influenced by [[Philadelphia soul|Philly soul]], disco and funk, fusing those styles with rock and dance. Artists like [[The Rolling Stones]], [[David Bowie]], [[Duran Duran]], [[Simple Minds]], [[INXS]], [[Eurythmics]], [[Depeche Mode]], [[The Clash]], [[New Order (band)|New Order]] and [[Devo]] belong, according to Allmusic, to this genre. Dance-rock embraces some experimental funk acts like [[A Certain Ratio]], [[Gang of Four (band)|Gang of Four]], and also musicians, for example [[Robert Palmer (singer)|Robert Palmer]], [[Billy Idol]] and [[Hall & Oates]]. This kind of dance-rock influenced acts such as [[Garbage (band)|Garbage]], [[No Doubt]], [[Robbie Williams]], [[Scissor Sisters]],<ref name=DanceRock>{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=explore|id=style/d13748|pure_url=yes}}|title=Explore music...

The first wave of artists arrived with [[New Order (band)|New Order]], [[Prince (musician)|Prince]], [[The Human League|Human League]], [[Blondie (band)|Blondie]], [[Tom Tom Club]] and [[Devo]], followed by [[Hall & Oates|Daryl Hall & John Oates]], [[Thompson Twins]], [[Haircut One Hundred|Haircut 100]], [[ABC (band)|ABC]], [[Depeche Mode]] and [[Spandau Ballet]].<ref name=Bill>{{cite journal|date=19 Jun 1982|journal=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|title=The Music Steps Beyond Disco: Where The Beat Meets The Street/Danceable Rock Generates First Bevy of Crossover Stars|issue=94|issn=0006-2510}}</ref> The scene also produced a lot of crossovers, including [[Kraftwerk]] getting [[Urban contemporary|R&B]] audiences with their 1981 influential album ''[[Computer World]]'', which paved the way for [[Afrika Bambaataa]]'s \"[[Planet Rock (song)|Planet Rock]]\" and [[electro (music)|electro]] in general.

[[Arthur Baker (musician)|Arthur Baker]] argued that synthesizers helped to shape the new music: \"I'm into synthesizers right now. The options are limitless.
