{"title_page": "Johann Christoph Wagenseil", "text_new": "{{expand German|Johann Christoph Wagenseil|date=July 2012}}\n[[Image:Johann Christoph Wagenseil.png|thumb|250px]]\n\n'''Johann Christoph Wagenseil''' (26 November 1633 - 9 October 1705) was a German historian, [[Oriental studies |Orientalist]], jurist and [[Christian Hebraist]].\n\n==Personal Life==\nHe is the son of [[Austrian Composer]] [[Georg Christoph Wagenseil]] and Sabine N\u00fcrnberger\n\n==Life and career==\nWagenseil was born in [[Nuremberg]] on 26 November 1633. As a youth he was educated at Stockholm, [[Greifswald]], and [[Rostock]]. In 1649 he entered the [[University of Altdorf]].  He traveled widely in Europe and became a member of numerous scholarly societies. In 1665 he received a doctorate of law at the [[University of Orleans]]. In 1667 he was made professor of history and civil law at Altdorf and then served professor of Oriental languages at the same university from 1674 to 1697. After 1667 he occupied the chair of [[ecclesiastical law]] until his death on 9 October 1705. Wagenseil twice served as deacon and rector at Altdorf and in 1699 he was named the university librarian.<ref name=Zohn>Zohn and Davis, 1954</ref>\n\nFor his knowledge of Hebrew he was chiefly indebted to the [[Sabbateans|Sabbatean]] [[Behr Perlhefter]] and [[Enoch Levi]], who had come from [[Vienna]] to [[F\u00fcrth]] around 1670.\n\n[N.B. While some of Wagenseil's later studies may have occurred with \"the Sabbatean Behr Perlhefter and Enoch Levi, when they came from Vienna to F\u00fcrth around 1670\" as mentioned in the preceding passage, by this time Wagenseil already was an accomplished Hebrew/talmud scholar. Indeed, in \"Die Letzte Vertreibung der Juden aus Wien und Nieder\u00f6sterreich\" Kaufmann expands on the subject of how Wagenseil, while still aged in his early 20s stayed for extended periods in the Vienna Jewish community where in particular he befriended and studied under Dr. Jehuda L\u00f6b Winkler as well as Rabbi Model Oettingen, thereafter maintaining correspondence with both of them from all the locations and university cities where he later resided as preceptor of the Kaiser's sons, as well as throughout ensuing years.]<ref>Die letzte Vertreibung der Juden aus Wien und Nieder\u00f6sterreich, ihre Vorgeschichte <1625 - 1670> und ihre Opfer / von David Kaufmann. Budapest, 1889</ref>\n\nWagenseil devoted his learning to publishing anti-Christian works of Jewish authors and undertook long journeys to gather his material and conduct research. He died in Altdorf in 1705.\n\n==Works==\nThe fruit of Wagenseil's travels was the collection ''Tela Ignea Satan\u00e6, sive Arcani et Horribiles Jud\u00e6orum Adversus Christum, Deum, et Christianam Religionem Libri'' (Altdorf, 1681), which included the apologetic ''\u1e24izzu\u1e33 Emunah'' of the [[Karaite Judaism|Karaite]] [[Isaac b. Abraham of Troki|Isaac Troki]].\n\nBecoming convinced by the ''[[Toledot Yeshu]]'' that the Jews were guilty of blaspheming Jesus, Wagenseil addressed to all high potentates his ''Denunciatio Christiana de Blasphemiis Jud\u00e6orum in Jesum Christum'' (Altdorf, 1703), in which he implored them to restrain the Jews from mocking Jesus, Mary, the cross, the mass, and Christian teachings. He was opposed to [[forcible baptism]] and similar conversion measures, and devoted a treatise to the refutation of the charge of [[blood libel|ritual murder]].\n\nWagenseil wrote, besides the above-mentioned books, ''Hoffnung der Erl\u00f6sung Israels'' (Leipzig, 1705), which appeared in a second edition (Altdorf, 1707), augmented by a number of smaller works under the general title ''Benachrichtigungen Wegen Einiger die Gemeine J\u00fcdischheit Betreffenden Sachen''. This collection contains the following treatises:\n\n# \"Quomodo cum Jud\u00e6o in Colloquio, Forte Fortuno Nato, Agendum\"\n# \"Jud\u00e6os non Uti Sanguine Christiano\"\n# \"Quomodo Usura Jud\u00e6orum Averti Possit\"\n# \"De Precatione Judaica Olenu\"\n# \"Denunciatio Christiana de Blasphemiis Jud\u00e6orum in Jesum Christum\"\n# \"Apologia\"\n# \"Denunciatio ad Magistratus Christianos de Juribus Eorum a Jud\u00e6is Violatis\"\n# \"An Christianus Salva Religione Jud\u00e6o Die Sabbati Inservire Possit.\"\n\nHe also wrote:\n\n*\"Exercitationes Sex Varii Argumenti\" (Altdorf, 1698)\n*\"Belehrung der J\u00fcdisch-Deutschen Red- und Schreibart\" (2d ed., K\u00f6nigsberg, 1699)\n*\"Disputatio Circularis de Jud\u00e6is\" (Altdorf, 1705)\n*\"Rabbi Moses Stendal's nach J\u00fcdischer Rede-Art Vorl\u00e4ngst in Reimen Gebrachte Psalmen David's\" (Leipzig, 1700);\n\nas well as an edition and Latin translation of the [[Talmudic]] treatise ''[[Sotah]]'' (Altdorf, 1674).\n\nHe was also the earliest researcher of the German [[Meistersinger]] tradition. His Latin history of Nuremberg ''De civitate noribergensi commentatio'' (Altdorf, 1697) included the German appendix ''Buch von der Meister-Singer holdseligen Kunst Anfang, Fort\u00fcbung, Nutzbarkeiten, und Lehrs\u00e4tzen'' (dated 1680), which discussed the origin of the guild, their Tabulaturen and customs. It also includes music examples by [[M\u00fcglin]], [[Heinrich Frauenlob]], {{Interlanguage link multi|Der Marner|de}} and {{Interlanguage link multi|Barthel Regenbogen|de|3=Regenbogen (Spruchdichter)}}. Though its accuracy has been doubted since the time of its publication, it remains an important account and formed the basis of accounts by [[Jean Paul]] and [[E. T. A. Hoffmann]], as well as [[Richard Wagner]]'s opera ''[[Die Meistersinger von N\u00fcrnberg]]''.<ref>{{GroveOnline|title=Johann Christoph Wagenseil|author=Heinz Zirnbauer|access-date=30 December 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== References ==\n*{{cite journal |last1=Zohn |first1=Harry |last2=Davis |first2=M.

As a youth he was educated at Stockholm, [[Greifswald]], and [[Rostock]]. In 1649 he entered the [[University of Altdorf]].  He traveled widely in Europe and became a member of numerous scholarly societies. In 1665 he received a doctorate of law at the [[University of Orleans]]. In 1667 he was made professor of history and civil law at Altdorf and then served professor of Oriental languages at the same university from 1674 to 1697. After 1667 he occupied the chair of [[ecclesiastical law]] until his death on 9 October 1705. Wagenseil twice served as deacon and rector at Altdorf and in 1699 he was named the university librarian.<ref name=Zohn>Zohn and Davis, 1954</ref>\n\nFor his knowledge of Hebrew he was chiefly indebted to the [[Sabbateans|Sabbatean]] [[Behr Perlhefter]] and [[Enoch Levi]], who had come from [[Vienna]] to [[F\u00fcrth]] around 1670.\n\n[N.B. While some of Wagenseil's later studies may have occurred with \"the Sabbatean Behr Perlhefter and Enoch Levi, when they came from Vienna to F\u00fcrth around 1670\" as mentioned in the preceding passage, by this time Wagenseil already was an accomplished Hebrew/talmud scholar. Indeed, in \"Die Letzte Vertreibung der Juden aus Wien und Nieder\u00f6sterreich\" Kaufmann expands on the subject of how Wagenseil, while still aged in his early 20s stayed for extended periods in the Vienna Jewish community where in particular he befriended and studied under Dr. Jehuda L\u00f6b Winkler as well as Rabbi Model Oettingen, thereafter maintaining correspondence with both of them from all the locations and university cities where he later resided as preceptor of the Kaiser's sons, as well as throughout ensuing years.]<ref>Die letzte Vertreibung der Juden aus Wien und Nieder\u00f6sterreich, ihre Vorgeschichte <1625 - 1670> und ihre Opfer / von David Kaufmann. Budapest, 1889</ref>\n\nWagenseil devoted his learning to publishing anti-Christian works of Jewish authors and undertook long journeys to gather his material and conduct research. He died in Altdorf in 1705.\n\n==Works==\nThe fruit of Wagenseil's travels was the collection ''Tela Ignea Satan\u00e6, sive Arcani et Horribiles Jud\u00e6orum Adversus Christum, Deum, et Christianam Religionem Libri'' (Altdorf, 1681), which included the apologetic ''\u1e24izzu\u1e33 Emunah'' of the [[Karaite Judaism|Karaite]] [[Isaac b. Abraham of Troki|Isaac Troki]].\n\nBecoming convinced by the ''[[Toledot Yeshu]]'' that the Jews were guilty of blaspheming Jesus, Wagenseil addressed to all high potentates his ''Denunciatio Christiana de Blasphemiis Jud\u00e6orum in Jesum Christum'' (Altdorf, 1703), in which he implored them to restrain the Jews from mocking Jesus, Mary, the cross, the mass, and Christian teachings. He was opposed to [[forcible baptism]] and similar conversion measures, and devoted a treatise to the refutation of the charge of [[blood libel|ritual murder]].\n\nWagenseil wrote, besides the above-mentioned books, ''Hoffnung der Erl\u00f6sung Israels'' (Leipzig, 1705), which appeared in a second edition (Altdorf, 1707), augmented by a number of smaller works under the general title ''Benachrichtigungen Wegen Einiger die Gemeine J\u00fcdischheit Betreffenden Sachen''. This collection contains the following treatises:\n\n# \"Quomodo cum Jud\u00e6o in Colloquio, Forte Fortuno Nato, Agendum\"\n# \"Jud\u00e6os non Uti Sanguine Christiano\"\n# \"Quomodo Usura Jud\u00e6orum Averti Possit\"\n# \"De Precatione Judaica Olenu\"\n# \"Denunciatio Christiana de Blasphemiis Jud\u00e6orum in Jesum Christum\"\n# \"Apologia\"\n# \"Denunciatio ad Magistratus Christianos de Juribus Eorum a Jud\u00e6is Violatis\"\n# \"An Christianus Salva Religione Jud\u00e6o Die Sabbati Inservire Possit.\"\n\nHe also wrote:\n\n*\"Exercitationes Sex Varii Argumenti\" (Altdorf, 1698)\n*\"Belehrung der J\u00fcdisch-Deutschen Red- und Schreibart\" (2d ed., K\u00f6nigsberg, 1699)\n*\"Disputatio Circularis de Jud\u00e6is\" (Altdorf, 1705)\n*\"Rabbi Moses Stendal's nach J\u00fcdischer Rede-Art Vorl\u00e4ngst in Reimen Gebrachte Psalmen David's\" (Leipzig, 1700);\n\nas well as an edition and Latin translation of the [[Talmudic]] treatise ''[[Sotah]]'' (Altdorf, 1674).\n\nHe was also the earliest researcher of the German [[Meistersinger]] tradition. His Latin history of Nuremberg ''De civitate noribergensi commentatio'' (Altdorf, 1697) included the German appendix ''Buch von der Meister-Singer holdseligen Kunst Anfang, Fort\u00fcbung, Nutzbarkeiten, und Lehrs\u00e4tzen'' (dated 1680), which discussed the origin of the guild, their Tabulaturen and customs. It also includes music examples by [[M\u00fcglin]], [[Heinrich Frauenlob]], {{Interlanguage link multi|Der Marner|de}} and {{Interlanguage link multi|Barthel Regenbogen|de|3=Regenbogen (Spruchdichter)}}. Though its accuracy has been doubted since the time of its publication, it remains an important account and formed the basis of accounts by [[Jean Paul]] and [[E. T. A. Hoffmann]], as well as [[Richard Wagner]]'s opera ''[[Die Meistersinger von N\u00fcrnberg]]''.<ref>{{GroveOnline|title=Johann Christoph Wagenseil|author=Heinz Zirnbauer|access-date=30 December 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== References ==\n*{{cite journal |last1=Zohn |first1=Harry |last2=Davis |first2=M.

In each round, a computer-operated jukebox randomly selects a category and  song. The song is played with missing words and the player must fill in the blank correctly in order to stay in the game. Each correct guess equals a cash prize, and as the group of players sing correctly, the pot gets bigger. The round ends when the song ends.

Na\" then the other players would say \" K! na K\" then the hosts would give the command \" Music!\" to start the song. The host would start singing the first part of the song then the player would continue the lines and must correct the missing blanks in each player. One correct answer is equivalent to 10 thousand pesos. If the player didn't correct the missing blank, their \"K!aban na Cash\" or the pot money would decrease or lower.
