Because it was a [[Player killers|PK]] guild, there were many attempts to conquer the dungeon, all of which ended in failure.\n\nAfter Nazarick was transported to the New World with Ainz and its custom NPCs, who became sentient as a result, the former began strengthening the tomb and collect information to protect it from possible threats. However, the NPCs mistook his intentions as preparing to take over the New World and began making their own plans. By the time Ainz realized this it was too late and he had no choice but to play along. This eventually led to Nazarick becoming its own nation, the {{Nihongo|Sorcerer Kingdom|\u9b54\u5c0e\u56fd|Mad\u014d Kuni}}.\n\n;{{Nihongo|{{va|Ainz Ooal Gown}}|\u30a2\u30a4\u30f3\u30ba\u30fb\u30a6\u30fc\u30eb\u30fb\u30b4\u30a6\u30f3|Ainzu \u016aru Goun}} / {{Nihongo|Momonga|\u30e2\u30e2\u30f3\u30ac}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Satoshi Hino]] (drama CD, anime)|Chris Guerrero}}\n:The protagonist/main character and the only remaining member of the guild, Ainz Ooal Gown. Originally he was a simple salaryman playing a VR online game, but after he was transported to the New World, he decides to make himself a legend in hopes of finding his old guildmates. To facilitate his search, he changes his name from Momonga to Ainz Ooal Gown. While Ainz initially accidentally set Nazarick on a course for world domination after a comment he made was misinterpreted, he slowly grows into his role as a leader after deciding to create a kingdom where humans and non-humans are equal. As he has the form of a [[lich]], he doesn't need to eat or sleep, can't be poisoned or killed by conventional means, but also has his emotions and empathy suppressed. Because of his formerly high level in YGGDRASIL, he can easily overpower even the strongest of magic casters in the New World; and while he lacks the skills of natural warriors, he compensates for it with raw strength. Over time, he has learnt how to improve fighting with physical weapons, but his greatest asset remains his strength. Ainz also has access to a wide variety of instant death and summoning spells which, though ineffective against fellow players, work very well against the inhabitants of the New World. He also has an array of items he purchased with real money back in YGGDRASIL, which give him abilities ranging from summoning extremely high level items (most of which belong to his guildmates) from the Guild's bank to instantly casting a spell that usually has a long casting time. When Ainz travels as an adventurer, he uses the alias \"Momon\" which later becomes \"Momon the Dark Hero\". In the CD drama #2, his real name is revealed to be Satoru Suzuki.\n\n===Floor Guardians===\nThe {{Nihongo|Floor Guardians|\u968e\u5c64\u5b88\u8b77\u8005|Kais\u014d G\u0101dian}} are a group NPC's who act as bosses. They are among the most powerful beings in Nazarick, with some even exceeding Ainz in terms of pure stats.\n\nUpon coming to the New World, they came to life with personalities based on their backstories. They also gained great influence over Nazarick's affairs due to each of them being the leader of their respective floor. However, they remain absolutely loyal to Ainz.\n\n;{{Nihongo|{{va|Albedo}}|\u30a2\u30eb\u30d9\u30c9|Arubedo}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Yumi Hara]] (drama CD, anime)|Elizabeth Maxwell}}\n:A [[succubus]] and the overseer of the Floor Guardians. She takes the form of a beautiful woman with black wings and horns wearing a white dress. Her beautiful and kind appearance hides her dark personality underneath. She was originally set to be a bitch, but Ainz modified her to be in love with him as a joke. As a result, upon coming to the New World, she became madly in love with him. She despises humans, viewing them as \"lower lifeforms\". She similarly harbors a secret hatred towards the other members of the Ainz Ooal Gown Guild for leaving Ainz. While in battle, she wears a suit of armor called ''Hermes Trismegistus'', which repels any physical damage, and fights using a [[bardiche]]. She also possesses the World Item ''Ginnungagap'', which can be used to devastate large areas.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Shalltear Bloodfallen|\u30b7\u30e3\u30eb\u30c6\u30a3\u30a2\u30fb\u30d6\u30e9\u30c3\u30c9\u30d5\u30a9\u30fc\u30eb\u30f3|Sharutia Buraddof\u014dren}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Sumire Uesaka]] (drama CD, anime)|[[Felecia Angelle]]}}\n:The Guardian of the First, Second, and Third floors of Nazarick. She takes on the form of a beautiful [[vampire]] girl. She is set to be somewhat of a pervert and a necrophile, causing her to fall for Ainz and putting her at odds with Albedo. She is the most powerful Floor Guardian in terms of overall stats, optimized for both melee and magic combat. Due to an incident where she was brainwashed by the Slane Theocracy, she unintentionally rebelled against Nazarick until she was killed by Ainz and later resurrected. Afterwards, she ended up blaming herself for her actions, even though she had no control of it. While she has since recovered somewhat, she maintains a constant sense of uncertainty and caution, while also belittling herself.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Aura Bella Fiora|\u30a2\u30a6\u30e9\u30fb\u30d9\u30e9\u30fb\u30d5\u30a3\u30aa\u30fc\u30e9|Aura Bera Fi\u014dra}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Emiri Kat\u014d]] (drama CD, anime)|Jill Harris}}\n:One of the Guardians of the Sixth floor of Nazarick, alongside her twin brother Mare. She takes on the form of a young Dark Elf who cross-dresses as a boy. She is also very energetic and extroverted, in contrast with her brother. Despite constantly bickering, she is very close to Shalltear, unintentionally mimicking the relationship between their creators. She fights with a whip and bow and can summon beasts to fight by her side. Ainz treats her and her brother as if they were his own children.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Mare Bello Fiore|\u30de\u30fc\u30ec\u30fb\u30d9\u30ed\u30fb\u30d5\u30a3\u30aa\u30fc\u30ec|M\u0101re Bero Fi\u014dre}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Yumi Uchiyama]] (drama CD, anime)|Megan Shipman}}\n:One of the Guardians of the Sixth floor of Nazarick alongside his twin sister Aura. He takes on the form of a young Dark Elf who cross-dresses as a girl. He is also rather shy and calm (although, it is heavily implied, that he is actually just acting) in comparison to his sister, causing him to be constantly ordered around by her. Despite this, however, he can fight and be ruthless when necessary. He specializes in Druid magic, capable of twisting the earth to his whims. Ainz often treats him and his sister as if they were his own children.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Demiurge|\u30c7\u30df\u30a6\u30eb\u30b4\u30b9|Demiurugosu}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Masayuki Kat\u014d]] (drama CD, anime)|Jeff Johnson}}\n:The Guardian of the seventh floor of Nazarick as well as the one in charge of its defenses. He takes on the form of a [[demon]] dressed in a business suit with glasses and a tail. He is among the most intelligent and evil NPCs of Nazarick, willing to commit unspeakable atrocities to further his goals. While getting along fine with the other Guardians, his relationship with Sebas is more strained due to their opposing natures which inherited from the guild members who created the two, who were also often at odds. There is also a lack of communication between him and Ainz, as the demon believes his liege can easily see through his intentions. To the population of the New World he is known as {{Nihongo|Jaldabaoth|\u30e4\u30eb\u30c0\u30d0\u30aa\u30c8|Yarudabaoto}}, an alternate identity that he assumed to further his goals without drawing suspicion.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Cocytus|\u30b3\u30ad\u30e5\u30fc\u30c8\u30b9|Koky\u016btosu}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Kenta Miyake]] (drama CD, anime)|[[Bryan Massey]]}}\n:The Guardian of the Fifth floor of Nazarick. He takes on the form of a huge, four-armed, humanoid insect with the power of cryokinesis. He also possesses multiple swords, spears, halberds and other kinds of armaments. He has a warrior personality, which makes him very noble and respects anyone with a strong fighting spirit. He is in charge of the security of Nazarick and later becomes responsible for the Lizardmen tribes that Ainz had him conquer. Among his fellow Guardians, he is closest to Demiurge, who he sees a rival and a friend.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Victim|\u30f4\u30a3\u30af\u30c6\u30a3\u30e0|Vuikutimu}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Nao T\u014dyama]]|Marla Acevedo}}\n:The Guardian of the Eight Floor of Nazarick. It holds the appearance of a 1 meter long, pink fetus, with a halo and stick-like wings. It speaks Enochian language. It is Nazarick's last line of defense, with its only ability being a self-destruct skill. Despite this however, it is humble and modest about its function, believing its sole purpose is to serve the members of the guild, Ainz Ooal Gown.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Gargantua|\u30ac\u30eb\u30ac\u30f3\u30c1\u30e5\u30a2|Garuganchua}}\n:The Guardian of the Fourth Floor. It is a stone golem with a height of over 30m. Unlike the other Floor Guardians, it is not a custom NPC but an in-game bonus won by the guild, Ainz Ooal Gown. As a result, it was not granted any personality or free will upon coming to the New World. Due to its unique nature, it is noted to be the strongest Floor Guardian, but due to its inability to react on its own, its strength falls considerably.\n\n===Area Guardians===\nArea Guardians serve as mini-bosses that guard a specific portion of a floor, which are usually very important locations. Some of them serve as subordinates to the Floor Guardians, while others act outside the chain of command.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Pandora's Actor|\u30d1\u30f3\u30c9\u30e9\u30ba\u30fb\u30a2\u30af\u30bf\u30fc|Pandorazu Akut\u0101}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Mamoru Miyano]] (drama CD, anime)|[[Eric Vale]]}}\n:The Area Guardian of Nazarick's Treasury, created by Ainz himself. He is a doppelg\u00e4nger with an egghead with three holes as a face and is dressed in a military officer's uniform. He can also assume the appearance and abilities of every member of the Ainz Ooal Gown guild. Because of this, Ainz occasionally calls on him as a stand-in when situations require both Ainz and Momon to be active at the same time. Despite being an Area Guardian, his abilities rival a Floor Guardian. Because Ainz created him while going through a [[chuunibyou]] phase, he programmed him to act with exaggerated gestures and body language, which now greatly embarrasses him. Despite not getting to spend much time together, he and Ainz share a strong bond, with the latter secretly allowing the former to call him \"father\".\n\n====Five Worst====\nThe Five Worst is an unofficial group composed of the five most disgusting NPCs of Nazarick. Each member has something that is considered \"the worst,\" from appearance to occupation.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Kyouhukou|\u6050\u6016\u516c, \u304d\u3087\u3046\u3075\u3053\u3046|Ky\u014dfukou}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Hiroshi Kamiya]] (anime)|[[John Swasey]]}}\n:The Area Guardian of a region referred to as Black Capsule, which is filled with carnivorous cockroaches, and a member of Five Worst, holding the title \"Worst Residence\". He has the appearance of a 30cm tall Cockroach that walks on its hind legs and wears a small crown as well as a cloak with a small scepter, giving the impression that he is the king of cockroaches. Despite his appearance, he speaks politely with all the etiquette of a Gentleman.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Gashokukochuuou |\u9913\u98df\u72d0\u87f2\u738b|\nGashokukochuu\u014d}}\n:The Area Guardian of a region referred to as The Large Hole and a member of Five Worst, holding the title of \"Worst Appearance\".

She is a visibly hideous creature who speaks in a seductive and teasing tone that loses any appeal due to her similarly hideous voice. She also holds affections for Ainz, causing him to avoid her.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Chacmool|\u30c1\u30e3\u30c3\u30af\u30e2\u30fc\u30eb|Chakkum\u014dru}}\n:Nazarick's musical instructor in charge of teaching the denizens of Nazarick on how play musical instruments and a member of Five Worst, holding the title \"Worst Personality\". He views humans as food or toys and requested Ainz for it and commands several Greater Doppelg\u00e4ngers.\n\n===Pleiades===\nThe {{Nihongo|Pleiades|\u30d7\u30ec\u30a2\u30c7\u30b9|Pureadesu}} are a group of NPCs dressed as maids lead by Sebas and who serve as Nazarick's last line of defence before the final floor. Despite each member, with the exception of Sebas, being weak by Nazarick's standards, their strength is equivalent to a legendary monster in the New World.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Sebas Tian|\u30bb\u30d0\u30b9\u30fb\u30c1\u30e3\u30f3|Sebasu Chan}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Shigeru Chiba]] (drama CD, anime)|Ed Blaylock (season 1), Bill Jenkins (season 2)}}\n:The head butler of Nazarick and overseer of the Pleiades. Despite not being a Floor Guardian, his abilities rival theirs, specializing in unarmed combat. He takes on the form of an elderly gentleman with a neat beard. Unlike the other NPCs, he doesn't hate outsiders and actually has a strong sense of justice, like his creator. Because of this, he has a habit of saving those in need, often bringing him in conflict with other NPCs and, on occasion, calling his loyalty to Ainz into question. He especially doesn't get along with Demiurge.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Yuri Alpha|\u30e6\u30ea\u30fb\u30a2\u30eb\u30d5\u30a1|Yuri Arufa}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Hiromi Igarashi]] (drama CD, anime)|Whitney Rodgers}}\n:The Vice-Captain, but de facto leader of the Pleiades. She is a [[Dullahan]] who uses a choker to keep her head attached to the rest of her body, causing her to appear to be human. She specializes in unarmed combat and uses Gauntlets in battle. She is programmed to behave like a teacher, because her creator was one, and the other Pleiades look up to her like a big sister. She holds a neutral stance towards humans, not disliking them but not helping them out either.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Lupusregina Beta|\u30eb\u30d7\u30b9\u30ec\u30ae\u30ca\u30fb\u30d9\u30fc\u30bf|Rupusuregina B\u0113ta}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Mikako Komatsu]] (drama CD, anime)|[[Alexis Tipton]]}}\n:One of the Pleiades.

However, in reality, she is a psychopath who enjoys using her healing abilities to slowly torture others to death. She is later assigned by Ainz to protect Carne Village.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Narberal Gamma|\u30ca\u30fc\u30d9\u30e9\u30eb\u30fb\u30ac\u30f3\u30de|N\u0101beraru Ganma}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Manami Numakura]] (drama CD, anime)|[[Anastasia Mu\u00f1oz]]}}\n:One of the Pleiades. She is a Doppelg\u00e4nger. However, because all her levels went into her combat abilities, she is permanently in human form. Instead, she is the strongest of the Pleiades, being a magic caster that specializes in lightning spells. She serves as Ainz' companion while under his \"Momon\" identity, going by the alias {{Nihongo|Nabe|\u30ca\u30fc\u30d9|N\u0101be}}. However, she despises and looks down on humans, which often causes trouble for him.\n\n;{{Nihongo|CZ2128 Delta|\u30b7\u30ba\u30fb\u30c7\u30eb\u30bf|Shizu Deruta}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Asami Seto]] (drama CD, anime)|[[Michelle Rojas]]}}\n:One of the Pleiades.

Due to her dual positions, she is unable to lead the group most of the time, causing Yuri Alpha to serve as leader in her stead. She is in charge of Nazarick's Teleportation Gates. She stated to be to only Human NPC in Nazarick. However, most don't consider her human due to her being immortal. Ainz seems to trust her a great deal, entrusting her with the Staff of Ainz Ooal Gown whenever he leaves Nazarick.\n\n===Others===\n;{{nihongo|Pestonya Shortcake Wanko|\u30da\u30b9\u30c8\u30fc\u30cb\u30e3\u30fb\u30b7\u30e7\u30fc\u30c8\u30b1\u30fc\u30ad\u30fb\u30ef\u30f3\u30b3|Pesut\u014dnya Sh\u014dtok\u0113ki Wanko}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Satomi Arai]]|[[Jamie Marchi]]}}\n:The Head-Maid of Nazarick.

He takes on the form of an emperor penguin with a superiority complex. He has been programmed with a desire to overthrow Ainz and take over Nazarick as a gag by his creator. The other NPCs are fully aware of this, but they don't care as he poses no threat and they know it is just a part of his settings.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Nigredo|\u30cb\u30b0\u30ec\u30c9|Niguredo}}\n:The older sister of Albedo, being created by the same creator. She specializes in information gathering. While she bears some similarity to Albedo, her face has no skin, resulting in a twisted appearance. Her mind is similarly broken, unless a baby-doll is given to her. However, while she has a body-doll, is actually one of the few NPCs of Nazarick that is genuinely kind-hearted. Despite being polar opposites in appearance and personality, she and Albedo generally get along just fine.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Rubedo|\u30eb\u30d9\u30c9|\nRubedo}}\n:The Younger sister of Albedo and Nigredo, being created by the same creator. She is the strongest NPC in Nazarick. Not much is known about her, but Albedo loves her while Nigredo fears her.\n\n==New World==\nThe New World is the world where Nazarick was transported to. There seems to be some sort of connection between this world and \"YGGDRASIL\", as it is implied that Players from the game are transported to it every couple of centuries. The world once had its own form of magic known as \"Wild Magic\". However, after Players introduced their \"Tier Magic\", it became more and more scarce. This world's inhabitants are also extremely weak by Player standards.\n\n===Nazarick's Allies===\nUpon arriving in the New World, Nazarick began rapidly expanding its influence. While Ainz obtained the loyalty of the world's inhabitants though mostly peaceful methods, the NPCs violently conquered any territory they laid their eyes on.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Hamsuke/The Wise King of the Forest|\u30cf\u30e0\u30b9\u30b1|Hamusuke}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Akeno Watanabe]] (drama CD, anime)|Heather Walker}}\n:A giant female Hamster with a snake-like tail that lived in the forest near Carne Village. She was thought to be the strongest beast among the forest denizens. While publicly known as \"The Wise King of the Forest\", she's actually more-or-less a dense idiot, though she is capable of human speech. Upon learning about her, Momon (Ainz' Adventurer Persona) seeks her out to increase his fame. Upon finding her, however, he is extremely disappointed, not understanding what others see in her, and proceeds to easily defeat her. He then promptly tames her and names her \"Hamsuke\". She then joins Ainz's adventurer group as his registered beast and totally devotes herself to him. While initially arrogant due to being strong by the New World's standards, upon meeting Nazarick's NPCs she realizes her weakness and devotes herself to becoming stronger.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Tuareninya Veyron|\u30c4\u30a2\u30ec\u30cb\u30fc\u30cb\u30e3\u30fb\u30d9\u30a4\u30ed\u30f3|Tsuaren\u012bnya Beiron}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Y\u016b Shimamura]] (Japanese)|Rachel Glass}}\n:Nazarick's newest apprentice-maid under Sebas Tian's supervision. She was a slave of Eight Fingers until Sebas found and saved her while on a mission. He nursed her back to health and she slowly opened up to him, eventually even developing a crush on him. However, this brought Sebas' loyalty to Ainz in question and they were both forced to appear before him. Learning about Ainz didn't change her feelings towards Sebas, however, as she was willing to let him kill her to prove his loyalty. Luckily, this was merely a test and her life was spared. She was then revealed that be the older sister of Ninya Berion, who Ainz felt indebted to, causing him to take her under his protection. As of now, she remains unaware of her younger sister's passing.\n\n====Carne Village====\n{{Nihongo|Carne Village|\u30ab\u30eb\u30cd\u6751|Karune Mura}} is a small village located at the border of the Re-Estize Kingdom, close to the Great {{Nihongo|Forest of Tob|\u30c8\u30d6\u306e\u5927\u68ee\u6797|Tobu No Dai Shinrin}} where various demi-humans, including Nazarick, reside.\n\nAfter Ainz saved the village from the Slane Theocracy, the villagers become loyal to him, even siding with Nazarick when it went to war with the Re-Estize Kingdom.

Enri shares a close bond with her childhood friend, and lover after the events of the 8th light novel, Nfirea. She and all the other villagers admire and respect Ainz for saving them from Nigun, and willingly leave the Kingdom when the crown prince attempt to force them into joining the fight against Ainz in the 9th novel. Carne Village becomes part of Ainz' territory once he wins the war. It is revealed in the 11th light novel that she and Nfirea have gotten married and moved into their own house.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Nemu Emmot|\u30cd\u30e0\u30fb\u30a8\u30e2\u30c3\u30c8|Nemu Emotto}}\n:{{Voiced by|Marika Kono (anime)|Jeannie Tirado}}\n:A girl from the Carne Village and Enri's younger sister who was saved by Ainz from soldiers of the Sunlight Scripture.

Nfirea harbors romantic feelings for Enri, which eventually come to fruition. He manages to create a Purple potion, out of materials from Nazarick and the new world, which works better than the blue potion but still less than Yggdrasil's Red Potion. Ainz is pleased with this step forward but hopes that he can at least make this kind of potion out of materials from the New World. It is revealed in the 11th light novel, that he and Enri have gotten married and are living in their own house.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Brita|\u30d6\u30ea\u30bf|Burita}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Satsuki Yukino]] (anime)|Katherine Bourne}}\n:The brash and often short-tempered leader of the vigilante committee of Carne Village and a former iron ranked adventurer. Brita first encountered \"Momon\" (Ainz's alias as an adventurer) when he accidentally destroyed her potion in a tavern. Ainz decides to give her a special red potion to make up for her loss. This potion ends up saving her life during Shalltear's rampage, since it made the vampire interrogate her instead of just killing her. She quits being an adventurer after encountering Shalltear and moves to Carne Village, where she ends up assisting the people. She also joins the Villagers in fighting against the Kingdom and for Ainz in the 9th Novel.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Lizzie Bareare|\u30ea\u30a3\u30b8\u30fc\u30fb\u30d0\u30ec\u30a2\u30ec|Ryij\u012b Bareare}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Ikuko Tani]] (anime)|[[Juli Erickson]]}}\n:Nfirea's grandmother, considered the best pharmacist in E-Rantel.

She and Nfirea are then later sent to Carne Village where they are told to create a Red Potion from Yggdrasil.\n\n====Lizardmen====\n{{Nihongo|Lizardmen|\u30ea\u30b6\u30fc\u30c9\u30de\u30f3|Riz\u0101doman}} are humanoid lizards that have shared human and reptilian characteristics. They live in a tribal-like society with there currently being five known tribes: Green Claw, Small Fang, Razor Tail, Dragon Tusk and Red eye.\n\nNazarick declared war on the Lizardmen in order to solidify their control over the region. In response, the tribes formed an alliance, but were defeated. Fortunately, Cocytus came to respect the Lizardmen and requested Ainz to show them mercy, causing him to place them under his supervision. Afterwards, the Lizardmen came to revere Ainz as a god.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Zaryusu Shasha|\u30b6\u30ea\u30e5\u30fc\u30b9\u30fb\u30b7\u30e3\u30b7\u30e3|Zary\u016bsu Shasha}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Hiroki Touchi]]|[[Josh Bangle]]<ref>https://www.funimation.com/shows/overlord/</ref>}}\n:A Lizardman of Green Claw and younger brother of Shasryu.

He is the one who manages to unify all the Lizardman tribe to fight against Ainz. While doing this, he also meets Crusch Lulu, who later becomes his wife. He, along with the other lizardmen, managed to beat Ainz's first attack and later faced Cocytus, being the last one remaining before being slain. However, Crush requests Ainz to resurrect him. Afterwards, he came to view Ainz as a god and swore servitude to him.

Not wanting a commoner in such a high position, the Kingdom's nobles try to limit his actions. One such case was by preventing him from being knighted. In response to this, the king created a new title just for him: 'Warrior Captain', and gave him his own 'Warrior Troop' to command. He first met Ainz while investigating the destruction of several villages and came to greatly respect him due to him saving Carne Village. Unfortunately, they later became enemies when the Kingdom and Nazarick went to war with each other. He challenged Ainz to a one-on-one duel where the latter reluctantly killed him. Before his death, he wished not to be resurrected should he lose, so Ainz honored his wish by casting a spell on him that invalidates resurrection.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Brain Unglaus|\u30d6\u30ec\u30a4\u30f3\u30fb\u30a2\u30f3\u30b0\u30e9\u30a6\u30b9|Burein Angurausu}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Koji Yusa]] (anime)|Chad Halbrook}}\n:A warrior turned mercenary who sees himself as Gazef's rival.

He barely managed to flee the Vampire. After that his will is shattered, stating how the peak of the strongest cannot be climbed by weak beings like humans. He regains his will when he sees Climb withstand the intense killing intent from Sebas, understanding that humans can still change and become stronger.

She saved him when he was just a street urchin about to die from sickness. As such, he views his services to her as a fulfilling of that debt he owes and is even willing to give up his life for her. However, he remains unaware of Renner's true nature. He is rather disliked due to him having such a position despite not even being a commoner, but an urchin. Despite this position, he holds no talent at fighting, making up for it with sheer effort. He eventually meets Sebas and, after convincing him to teach him some of his skills, they become friends, though he remains unaware of his loyalty towards Ainz.

He sees Nazarick as a great threat to the New World.\n\n====Zurrernorn====\n{{Nihongo|Zurrernorn|\u30ba\u30fc\u30e9\u30fc\u30ce\u30fc\u30f3|Z\u016br\u0101n\u014dn}} is a criminal cult infamous for its uses of necromancy and the Undead.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Clementine|\u30af\u30ec\u30de\u30f3\u30c6\u30a3\u30fc\u30cc|Kuremant\u012bnu}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Aoi Y\u016bki]] (drama CD, anime)|Mikaela Krantz}}\n:A rogue warrior and a former member of the Slane Theocracy\u00b4s Black Scripture. She was psychopath who wore armor made from medals from Adventurers she has slain. She was not an actual member of Zurrernorn, but merely associated with them for protection. She was killed by Momon (Ainz\u00b4 Adventurer persona), when he crushed her spine. However, her body mysteriously disappeared in the aftermath.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Khajiit Dale Badantel|\u30ab\u30b8\u30c3\u30c8\u30fb\u30c7\u30a4\u30eb\u30fb\u30d0\u30c0\u30f3\u30c6\u30fc\u30eb|Kajitto Deiru Badant\u0113ru}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Minoru Inaba]] (drama CD, anime)|Brad Venable}}\n:One of the twelve core members of Zuranon.

Because it was a [[Player killers|PK]] guild, there were many attempts to conquer the dungeon, all of which ended in failure.\n\nAfter Nazarick was transported to the New World with Ainz and its custom NPCs, who became sentient as a result, the former began strengthening the tomb and collect information to protect it from possible threats. However, the NPCs mistook his intentions as preparing to take over the New World and began making their own plans. By the time Ainz realized this it was too late and he had no choice but to play along. This eventually led to Nazarick becoming its own nation, the {{Nihongo|Sorcerer Kingdom|\u9b54\u5c0e\u56fd|Mad\u014d Kuni}}.\n\n;{{Nihongo|{{va|Ainz Ooal Gown}}|\u30a2\u30a4\u30f3\u30ba\u30fb\u30a6\u30fc\u30eb\u30fb\u30b4\u30a6\u30f3|Ainzu \u016aru Goun}} / {{Nihongo|Momonga|\u30e2\u30e2\u30f3\u30ac}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Satoshi Hino]] (drama CD, anime)|Chris Guerrero}}\n:The protagonist/main character and the only remaining member of the guild, Ainz Ooal Gown. Originally he was a simple salaryman playing a VR online game, but after he was transported to the New World, he decides to make himself a legend in hopes of finding his old guildmates. To facilitate his search, he changes his name from Momonga to Ainz Ooal Gown. While Ainz initially accidentally set Nazarick on a course for world domination after a comment he made was misinterpreted, he slowly grows into his role as a leader after deciding to create a kingdom where humans and non-humans are equal. As he has the form of a [[lich]], he doesn't need to eat or sleep, can't be poisoned or killed by conventional means, but also has his emotions and empathy suppressed. Because of his formerly high level in YGGDRASIL, he can easily overpower even the strongest of magic casters in the New World; and while he lacks the skills of natural warriors, he compensates for it with raw strength. Over time, he has learnt how to improve fighting with physical weapons, but his greatest asset remains his strength. Ainz also has access to a wide variety of instant death and summoning spells which, though ineffective against fellow players, work very well against the inhabitants of the New World. He also has an array of items he purchased with real money back in YGGDRASIL, which give him abilities ranging from summoning extremely high level items (most of which belong to his guildmates) from the Guild's bank to instantly casting a spell that usually has a long casting time. When Ainz travels as an adventurer, he uses the alias \"Momon\" which later becomes \"Momon the Dark Hero\". In the CD drama #2, his real name is revealed to be Satoru Suzuki.\n\n===Floor Guardians===\nThe {{Nihongo|Floor Guardians|\u968e\u5c64\u5b88\u8b77\u8005|Kais\u014d G\u0101dian}} are a group NPC's who act as bosses. They are among the most powerful beings in Nazarick, with some even exceeding Ainz in terms of pure stats.\n\nUpon coming to the New World, they came to life with personalities based on their backstories. They also gained great influence over Nazarick's affairs due to each of them being the leader of their respective floor. However, they remain absolutely loyal to Ainz.\n\n;{{Nihongo|{{va|Albedo}}|\u30a2\u30eb\u30d9\u30c9|Arubedo}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Yumi Hara]] (drama CD, anime)|Elizabeth Maxwell}}\n:A [[succubus]] and the overseer of the Floor Guardians. She takes the form of a beautiful woman with black wings and horns wearing a white dress. Her beautiful and kind appearance hides her dark personality underneath. She was originally set to be a bitch, but Ainz modified her to be in love with him as a joke. As a result, upon coming to the New World, she became madly in love with him. She despises humans, viewing them as \"lower lifeforms\". She similarly harbors a secret hatred towards the other members of the Ainz Ooal Gown Guild for leaving Ainz. While in battle, she wears a suit of armor called ''Hermes Trismegistus'', which repels any physical damage, and fights using a [[bardiche]]. She also possesses the World Item ''Ginnungagap'', which can be used to devastate large areas.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Shalltear Bloodfallen|\u30b7\u30e3\u30eb\u30c6\u30a3\u30a2\u30fb\u30d6\u30e9\u30c3\u30c9\u30d5\u30a9\u30fc\u30eb\u30f3|Sharutia Buraddof\u014dren}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Sumire Uesaka]] (drama CD, anime)|[[Felecia Angelle]]}}\n:The Guardian of the First, Second, and Third floors of Nazarick. She takes on the form of a beautiful [[vampire]] girl. She is set to be somewhat of a pervert and a necrophile, causing her to fall for Ainz and putting her at odds with Albedo. She is the most powerful Floor Guardian in terms of overall stats, optimized for both melee and magic combat. Due to an incident where she was brainwashed by the Slane Theocracy, she unintentionally rebelled against Nazarick until she was killed by Ainz and later resurrected. Afterwards, she ended up blaming herself for her actions, even though she had no control of it. While she has since recovered somewhat, she maintains a constant sense of uncertainty and caution, while also belittling herself.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Aura Bella Fiora|\u30a2\u30a6\u30e9\u30fb\u30d9\u30e9\u30fb\u30d5\u30a3\u30aa\u30fc\u30e9|Aura Bera Fi\u014dra}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Emiri Kat\u014d]] (drama CD, anime)|Jill Harris}}\n:One of the Guardians of the Sixth floor of Nazarick, alongside her twin brother Mare. She takes on the form of a young Dark Elf who cross-dresses as a boy. She is also very energetic and extroverted, in contrast with her brother. Despite constantly bickering, she is very close to Shalltear, unintentionally mimicking the relationship between their creators. She fights with a whip and bow and can summon beasts to fight by her side. Ainz treats her and her brother as if they were his own children.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Mare Bello Fiore|\u30de\u30fc\u30ec\u30fb\u30d9\u30ed\u30fb\u30d5\u30a3\u30aa\u30fc\u30ec|M\u0101re Bero Fi\u014dre}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Yumi Uchiyama]] (drama CD, anime)|Megan Shipman}}\n:One of the Guardians of the Sixth floor of Nazarick alongside his twin sister Aura. He takes on the form of a young Dark Elf who cross-dresses as a girl. He is also rather shy and calm (although, it is heavily implied, that he is actually just acting) in comparison to his sister, causing him to be constantly ordered around by her. Despite this, however, he can fight and be ruthless when necessary. He specializes in Druid magic, capable of twisting the earth to his whims. Ainz often treats him and his sister as if they were his own children.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Demiurge|\u30c7\u30df\u30a6\u30eb\u30b4\u30b9|Demiurugosu}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Masayuki Kat\u014d]] (drama CD, anime)|Jeff Johnson}}\n:The Guardian of the seventh floor of Nazarick as well as the one in charge of its defenses. He takes on the form of a [[demon]] dressed in a business suit with glasses and a tail. He is among the most intelligent and evil NPCs of Nazarick, willing to commit unspeakable atrocities to further his goals. While getting along fine with the other Guardians, his relationship with Sebas is more strained due to their opposing natures which inherited from the guild members who created the two, who were also often at odds. There is also a lack of communication between him and Ainz, as the demon believes his liege can easily see through his intentions. To the population of the New World he is known as {{Nihongo|Jaldabaoth|\u30e4\u30eb\u30c0\u30d0\u30aa\u30c8|Yarudabaoto}}, an alternate identity that he assumed to further his goals without drawing suspicion.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Cocytus|\u30b3\u30ad\u30e5\u30fc\u30c8\u30b9|Koky\u016btosu}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Kenta Miyake]] (drama CD, anime)|[[Bryan Massey]]}}\n:The Guardian of the Fifth floor of Nazarick. He takes on the form of a huge, four-armed, humanoid insect with the power of cryokinesis. He also possesses multiple swords, spears, halberds and other kinds of armaments. He has a warrior personality, which makes him very noble and respects anyone with a strong fighting spirit. He is in charge of the security of Nazarick and later becomes responsible for the Lizardmen tribes that Ainz had him conquer. Among his fellow Guardians, he is closest to Demiurge, who he sees a rival and a friend.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Victim|\u30f4\u30a3\u30af\u30c6\u30a3\u30e0|Vuikutimu}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Nao T\u014dyama]]|Marla Acevedo}}\n:The Guardian of the Eight Floor of Nazarick. It holds the appearance of a 1 meter long, pink fetus, with a halo and stick-like wings. It speaks Enochian language. It is Nazarick's last line of defense, with its only ability being a self-destruct skill. Despite this however, it is humble and modest about its function, believing its sole purpose is to serve the members of the guild, Ainz Ooal Gown.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Gargantua|\u30ac\u30eb\u30ac\u30f3\u30c1\u30e5\u30a2|Garuganchua}}\n:The Guardian of the Fourth Floor. It is a stone golem with a height of over 30m. Unlike the other Floor Guardians, it is not a custom NPC but an in-game bonus won by the guild, Ainz Ooal Gown. As a result, it was not granted any personality or free will upon coming to the New World. Due to its unique nature, it is noted to be the strongest Floor Guardian, but due to its inability to react on its own, its strength falls considerably.\n\n===Area Guardians===\nArea Guardians serve as mini-bosses that guard a specific portion of a floor, which are usually very important locations. Some of them serve as subordinates to the Floor Guardians, while others act outside the chain of command.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Pandora's Actor|\u30d1\u30f3\u30c9\u30e9\u30ba\u30fb\u30a2\u30af\u30bf\u30fc|Pandorazu Akut\u0101}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Mamoru Miyano]] (drama CD, anime)|[[Eric Vale]]}}\n:The Area Guardian of Nazarick's Treasury, created by Ainz himself. He is a doppelg\u00e4nger with an egghead with three holes as a face and is dressed in a military officer's uniform. He can also assume the appearance and abilities of every member of the Ainz Ooal Gown guild. Because of this, Ainz occasionally calls on him as a stand-in when situations require both Ainz and Momon to be active at the same time. Despite being an Area Guardian, his abilities rival a Floor Guardian. Because Ainz created him while going through a [[chuunibyou]] phase, he programmed him to act with exaggerated gestures and body language, which now greatly embarrasses him. Despite not getting to spend much time together, he and Ainz share a strong bond, with the latter secretly allowing the former to call him \"father\".\n\n====Five Worst====\nThe Five Worst is an unofficial group composed of the five most disgusting NPCs of Nazarick. Each member has something that is considered \"the worst,\" from appearance to occupation.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Kyouhukou|\u6050\u6016\u516c, \u304d\u3087\u3046\u3075\u3053\u3046|Ky\u014dfukou}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Hiroshi Kamiya]] (anime)|[[John Swasey]]}}\n:The Area Guardian of a region referred to as Black Capsule, which is filled with carnivorous cockroaches, and a member of Five Worst, holding the title \"Worst Residence\". He has the appearance of a 30cm tall Cockroach that walks on its hind legs and wears a small crown as well as a cloak with a small scepter, giving the impression that he is the king of cockroaches. Despite his appearance, he speaks politely with all the etiquette of a Gentleman.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Gashokukochuuou |\u9913\u98df\u72d0\u87f2\u738b|\nGashokukochuu\u014d}}\n:The Area Guardian of a region referred to as The Large Hole and a member of Five Worst, holding the title of \"Worst Appearance\". It is a parasitic creature, using humans as a \"House\".\n\n;{{Nihongo|Neuronist Painkill|\u30cb\u30e5\u30fc\u30ed\u30cb\u30b9\u30c8\u30fb\u30da\u30a4\u30f3\u30ad\u30eb|\nNy\u016bronisuto Peinkiru}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Tessh\u014d Genda]] (anime)|[[Aaron Dismuke]]}}\n:Nazarick's Special Intelligence Investigator in charge of interrogating and torturing prisoners and a member of Five Worst, holding the title \"Worst Occupation\". She is a visibly hideous creature who speaks in a seductive and teasing tone that loses any appeal due to her similarly hideous voice. She also holds affections for Ainz, causing him to avoid her.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Chacmool|\u30c1\u30e3\u30c3\u30af\u30e2\u30fc\u30eb|Chakkum\u014dru}}\n:Nazarick's musical instructor in charge of teaching the denizens of Nazarick on how play musical instruments and a member of Five Worst, holding the title \"Worst Personality\". He views humans as food or toys and requested Ainz for it and commands several Greater Doppelg\u00e4ngers.\n\n===Pleiades===\nThe {{Nihongo|Pleiades|\u30d7\u30ec\u30a2\u30c7\u30b9|Pureadesu}} are a group of NPCs dressed as maids lead by Sebas and who serve as Nazarick's last line of defence before the final floor. Despite each member, with the exception of Sebas, being weak by Nazarick's standards, their strength is equivalent to a legendary monster in the New World.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Sebas Tian|\u30bb\u30d0\u30b9\u30fb\u30c1\u30e3\u30f3|Sebasu Chan}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Shigeru Chiba]] (drama CD, anime)|Ed Blaylock (season 1), Bill Jenkins (season 2)}}\n:The head butler of Nazarick and overseer of the Pleiades. Despite not being a Floor Guardian, his abilities rival theirs, specializing in unarmed combat. He takes on the form of an elderly gentleman with a neat beard. Unlike the other NPCs, he doesn't hate outsiders and actually has a strong sense of justice, like his creator. Because of this, he has a habit of saving those in need, often bringing him in conflict with other NPCs and, on occasion, calling his loyalty to Ainz into question. He especially doesn't get along with Demiurge.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Yuri Alpha|\u30e6\u30ea\u30fb\u30a2\u30eb\u30d5\u30a1|Yuri Arufa}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Hiromi Igarashi]] (drama CD, anime)|Whitney Rodgers}}\n:The Vice-Captain, but de facto leader of the Pleiades. She is a [[Dullahan]] who uses a choker to keep her head attached to the rest of her body, causing her to appear to be human. She specializes in unarmed combat and uses Gauntlets in battle. She is programmed to behave like a teacher, because her creator was one, and the other Pleiades look up to her like a big sister. She holds a neutral stance towards humans, not disliking them but not helping them out either.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Lupusregina Beta|\u30eb\u30d7\u30b9\u30ec\u30ae\u30ca\u30fb\u30d9\u30fc\u30bf|Rupusuregina B\u0113ta}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Mikako Komatsu]] (drama CD, anime)|[[Alexis Tipton]]}}\n:One of the Pleiades. She's a werewolf in human form and serves as the group's healer. In public, she is a sociable and friendly person who likes to make lewd jokes. However, in reality, she is a psychopath who enjoys using her healing abilities to slowly torture others to death. She is later assigned by Ainz to protect Carne Village.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Narberal Gamma|\u30ca\u30fc\u30d9\u30e9\u30eb\u30fb\u30ac\u30f3\u30de|N\u0101beraru Ganma}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Manami Numakura]] (drama CD, anime)|[[Anastasia Mu\u00f1oz]]}}\n:One of the Pleiades. She is a Doppelg\u00e4nger. However, because all her levels went into her combat abilities, she is permanently in human form. Instead, she is the strongest of the Pleiades, being a magic caster that specializes in lightning spells. She serves as Ainz' companion while under his \"Momon\" identity, going by the alias {{Nihongo|Nabe|\u30ca\u30fc\u30d9|N\u0101be}}. However, she despises and looks down on humans, which often causes trouble for him.\n\n;{{Nihongo|CZ2128 Delta|\u30b7\u30ba\u30fb\u30c7\u30eb\u30bf|Shizu Deruta}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Asami Seto]] (drama CD, anime)|[[Michelle Rojas]]}}\n:One of the Pleiades. She's an automaton who fights using guns and war knives. While silent and emotionless, she holds no particular dislike towards humans.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Solution Epsilon|\u30bd\u30ea\u30e5\u30b7\u30e3\u30f3\u30fb\u30a4\u30d7\u30b7\u30ed\u30f3|Soryushan Ipushiron}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Ayane Sakura]] (drama CD, anime)|Mallorie Rodak}}\n:One of the Pleiades. She is a Slime that takes on a human form. She is an assassin and can absorb people and objects into her body to be stored or devoured. Being a Slime, she preys on humans and generally despises and looks down on them.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Entoma Vasilissa Zeta|\u30a8\u30f3\u30c8\u30de\u30fb\u30f4\u30a1\u30b7\u30ea\u30c3\u30b5\u30fb\u30bc\u30fc\u30bf|Entoma Vuashirissa Z\u0113ta}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Kei Shindo]] (drama CD, anime)|[[Tia Ballard]]}}\n:One of the Pleiades. She is an Insectoid who disguises herself as a human by wearing a mask and changing her voice. She is an entomancer, being able to summon fellow Insectoids. Being an Insectoid, she preys on humans when hungry, but otherwise doesn't consider them worth her attention. She harbors a grudge towards Evileye from the Adventurer Group Blue Roses, who defeated and humiliated her.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Aureole Omega|\u30aa\u30fc\u30ec\u30aa\u30fc\u30eb\u30fb\u30aa\u30e1\u30ac|\u014cre\u014dru Omega}}\n:The leader of Pleiades and the Area Guardian of the region known as the Cherry Blossom Sanctuary. Due to her dual positions, she is unable to lead the group most of the time, causing Yuri Alpha to serve as leader in her stead. She is in charge of Nazarick's Teleportation Gates. She stated to be to only Human NPC in Nazarick. However, most don't consider her human due to her being immortal. Ainz seems to trust her a great deal, entrusting her with the Staff of Ainz Ooal Gown whenever he leaves Nazarick.\n\n===Others===\n;{{nihongo|Pestonya Shortcake Wanko|\u30da\u30b9\u30c8\u30fc\u30cb\u30e3\u30fb\u30b7\u30e7\u30fc\u30c8\u30b1\u30fc\u30ad\u30fb\u30ef\u30f3\u30b3|Pesut\u014dnya Sh\u014dtok\u0113ki Wanko}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Satomi Arai]]|[[Jamie Marchi]]}}\n:The Head-Maid of Nazarick.

He takes on the form of an emperor penguin with a superiority complex. He has been programmed with a desire to overthrow Ainz and take over Nazarick as a gag by his creator. The other NPCs are fully aware of this, but they don't care as he poses no threat and they know it is just a part of his settings.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Nigredo|\u30cb\u30b0\u30ec\u30c9|Niguredo}}\n:The older sister of Albedo, being created by the same creator. She specializes in information gathering. While she bears some similarity to Albedo, her face has no skin, resulting in a twisted appearance. Her mind is similarly broken, unless a baby-doll is given to her. However, while she has a body-doll, is actually one of the few NPCs of Nazarick that is genuinely kind-hearted. Despite being polar opposites in appearance and personality, she and Albedo generally get along just fine.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Rubedo|\u30eb\u30d9\u30c9|\nRubedo}}\n:The Younger sister of Albedo and Nigredo, being created by the same creator. She is the strongest NPC in Nazarick. Not much is known about her, but Albedo loves her while Nigredo fears her.\n\n==New World==\nThe New World is the world where Nazarick was transported to. There seems to be some sort of connection between this world and \"YGGDRASIL\", as it is implied that Players from the game are transported to it every couple of centuries. The world once had its own form of magic known as \"Wild Magic\". However, after Players introduced their \"Tier Magic\", it became more and more scarce. This world's inhabitants are also extremely weak by Player standards.\n\n===Nazarick's Allies===\nUpon arriving in the New World, Nazarick began rapidly expanding its influence. While Ainz obtained the loyalty of the world's inhabitants though mostly peaceful methods, the NPCs violently conquered any territory they laid their eyes on.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Hamsuke/The Wise King of the Forest|\u30cf\u30e0\u30b9\u30b1|Hamusuke}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Akeno Watanabe]] (drama CD, anime)|Heather Walker}}\n:A giant female Hamster with a snake-like tail that lived in the forest near Carne Village. She was thought to be the strongest beast among the forest denizens. While publicly known as \"The Wise King of the Forest\", she's actually more-or-less a dense idiot, though she is capable of human speech. Upon learning about her, Momon (Ainz' Adventurer Persona) seeks her out to increase his fame. Upon finding her, however, he is extremely disappointed, not understanding what others see in her, and proceeds to easily defeat her. He then promptly tames her and names her \"Hamsuke\". She then joins Ainz's adventurer group as his registered beast and totally devotes herself to him. While initially arrogant due to being strong by the New World's standards, upon meeting Nazarick's NPCs she realizes her weakness and devotes herself to becoming stronger.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Tuareninya Veyron|\u30c4\u30a2\u30ec\u30cb\u30fc\u30cb\u30e3\u30fb\u30d9\u30a4\u30ed\u30f3|Tsuaren\u012bnya Beiron}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Y\u016b Shimamura]] (Japanese)|Rachel Glass}}\n:Nazarick's newest apprentice-maid under Sebas Tian's supervision. She was a slave of Eight Fingers until Sebas found and saved her while on a mission. He nursed her back to health and she slowly opened up to him, eventually even developing a crush on him. However, this brought Sebas' loyalty to Ainz in question and they were both forced to appear before him. Learning about Ainz didn't change her feelings towards Sebas, however, as she was willing to let him kill her to prove his loyalty. Luckily, this was merely a test and her life was spared.

Not wanting a commoner in such a high position, the Kingdom's nobles try to limit his actions. One such case was by preventing him from being knighted. In response to this, the king created a new title just for him: 'Warrior Captain', and gave him his own 'Warrior Troop' to command. He first met Ainz while investigating the destruction of several villages and came to greatly respect him due to him saving Carne Village. Unfortunately, they later became enemies when the Kingdom and Nazarick went to war with each other. He challenged Ainz to a one-on-one duel where the latter reluctantly killed him. Before his death, he wished not to be resurrected should he lose, so Ainz honored his wish by casting a spell on him that invalidates resurrection.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Brain Unglaus|\u30d6\u30ec\u30a4\u30f3\u30fb\u30a2\u30f3\u30b0\u30e9\u30a6\u30b9|Burein Angurausu}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Koji Yusa]] (anime)|Chad Halbrook}}\n:A warrior turned mercenary who sees himself as Gazef's rival.

He regains his will when he sees Climb withstand the intense killing intent from Sebas, understanding that humans can still change and become stronger.

However, he remains unaware of Renner's true nature. He is rather disliked due to him having such a position despite not even being a commoner, but an urchin. Despite this position, he holds no talent at fighting, making up for it with sheer effort.
