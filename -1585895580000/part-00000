Causing high losses to producers and distributers\n\n==Plot==\nA working prisoner is getting beaten up by a Tamilan named Govind Raj. The prisoner beaten up gets saved by another prisoner named Sachidanandan. Later he is called to the station and he comes to know that he will be released from prison very soon. He also receives a letter from his brother saying that a suprise awaits him as he gets released. As he goes through the letter, old memories flash back in his mind.\n\nSachi's father was about to remarry. Sachi was very excited for getting a new mother. He also saw that the mother had a son which was going to be his step-brother named Vishnu. He tries to befriend and love Vishnu but he rejects him but later on starts accepting him. His step-mother is also going to have a new baby. Once after returning from a function Sachi, witnesses his step mother harassed by her ex-husband and tries to take away Vishnu. Sachi kills the man while saving his brother and mother. He goes to a juvenile home for his crime and over there he befriends Khan, Ghani and Pareekkar. Once he witnesses Khan and Ghani getting beaten up by a sadistic police officer. Sachi kills the officer while trying to save his friends and hence goes to a central jail because he was an adult aged 16. He is sentenced for two life term sentences. In the prison, he discovers his ability to see in the dark.\n\nAs he exits the prison he is well-received by his younger brother who was born after he went to jail who was Manu. He was also received by his prison friends Pareekkar, Khan and Ghani. They invite Sachi to join them to work with Edwin Moses who is a drug mafia leader. Sachi warns them and decides to lead a peaceful life with his family. The surprise awaiting him was that his brother Dr.Vishnu was soon to marry Vandhana who was a doctor and the marriage was postponed so that Sachi can witness the marriage as Vishnu was adamant. The marriage takes place and as Vandhana seeks Sachi's blessings, she realizes that he was the one who saved her from a gang and in the process of saving her, Sachi's back was scratched by a sickle. The next day Vandhana forces Sachi to tell the truth about him.\n\nWhen the police found out that Sachi could see in the dark, he and many other prisoners was sent for commando operations. They were often sent unarmed to face armed opponents. Sachi's jail term was extended as every time he went for the operation, the report written was that he jumped or escaped from the jail. Many prisoners never returned. Their bodies were found in random places. A police officer named Vedantham IPS approaches Sachi. He explains to him that the drug mafia has returned stronger as ever, and it is controlled by a person whom no one has seen named Edwin Moses. He tells Sachi that innocent people are used for drug business without their knowledge. Sachi rejects it saying that he wants to live peacefully with his family.\n\nSachi and his family faces many troubles from Edwin Moses  and Shetty. Later Shetty explains to Sachi that Edwin is doing all this for a drug container worth crores which is in Shetty's control. Sachi finds his friends with alliance with Edwin Moses but reveals to him that they had nothing to do with it unless a gangster named Muthan died. Edwin had been pestering them for the container.

The prisoner beaten up gets saved by another prisoner named Sachidanandan. Later he is called to the station and he comes to know that he will be released from prison very soon. He also receives a letter from his brother saying that a suprise awaits him as he gets released. As he goes through the letter, old memories flash back in his mind.\n\nSachi's father was about to remarry. Sachi was very excited for getting a new mother. He also saw that the mother had a son which was going to be his step-brother named Vishnu. He tries to befriend and love Vishnu but he rejects him but later on starts accepting him. His step-mother is also going to have a new baby. Once after returning from a function Sachi, witnesses his step mother harassed by her ex-husband and tries to take away Vishnu. Sachi kills the man while saving his brother and mother. He goes to a juvenile home for his crime and over there he befriends Khan, Ghani and Pareekkar. Once he witnesses Khan and Ghani getting beaten up by a sadistic police officer. Sachi kills the officer while trying to save his friends and hence goes to a central jail because he was an adult aged 16. He is sentenced for two life term sentences. In the prison, he discovers his ability to see in the dark.\n\nAs he exits the prison he is well-received by his younger brother who was born after he went to jail who was Manu. He was also received by his prison friends Pareekkar, Khan and Ghani. They invite Sachi to join them to work with Edwin Moses who is a drug mafia leader. Sachi warns them and decides to lead a peaceful life with his family. The surprise awaiting him was that his brother Dr.Vishnu was soon to marry Vandhana who was a doctor and the marriage was postponed so that Sachi can witness the marriage as Vishnu was adamant. The marriage takes place and as Vandhana seeks Sachi's blessings, she realizes that he was the one who saved her from a gang and in the process of saving her, Sachi's back was scratched by a sickle. The next day Vandhana forces Sachi to tell the truth about him.\n\nWhen the police found out that Sachi could see in the dark, he and many other prisoners was sent for commando operations. They were often sent unarmed to face armed opponents. Sachi's jail term was extended as every time he went for the operation, the report written was that he jumped or escaped from the jail. Many prisoners never returned. Their bodies were found in random places. A police officer named Vedantham IPS approaches Sachi. He explains to him that the drug mafia has returned stronger as ever, and it is controlled by a person whom no one has seen named Edwin Moses. He tells Sachi that innocent people are used for drug business without their knowledge. Sachi rejects it saying that he wants to live peacefully with his family.\n\nSachi and his family faces many troubles from Edwin Moses  and Shetty. Later Shetty explains to Sachi that Edwin is doing all this for a drug container worth crores which is in Shetty's control. Sachi finds his friends with alliance with Edwin Moses but reveals to him that they had nothing to do with it unless a gangster named Muthan died. Edwin had been pestering them for the container.

The pasticcio was assembled around 1750.\n\nThe only extant manuscript of the Pasticcio was written by Johann Christoph Farlau and an unknown scribe. Farlau was a pupil of [[Johann Christoph Altnickol]], Bach's son-in-law. Since a reliable differentiation between the handwriting of the master and the pupil was only done in the early 21st century, older scholarship generally attributes the realisation of the Pasticcio to Altnickol and/or indicates Altnickol as the composer of the movements that can not be attributed to other composers.\n\nIn the second half of the 20th century Bach scholarship turned its attention to the pasticcio as it was possibly Bach's elusive \"[[Passions (Bach)#Bach's Passion settings|5th Passion]]\", and for containing previously unknown work by the composer ({{nobreak|[[Bach Compendium|BC]] D 10}}).\n\n==History==\n[[File:Carl Heinrich Graun.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|[[Carl Heinrich Graun]] (1703\u20131759)]]\n[[File:Telemann by Preisler.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|[[Georg Philipp Telemann]] (1681\u20131767)]]\n[[File:J.S. Bach by August Weger.png|thumb|upright=1.2|[[Johann Sebastian Bach]] (1685\u20131750)]]\nThe backbone of the ''Wer ist der, so von Edom k\u00f6mmt'' pasticcio is ''Ein L\u00e4mmlein geht und tr\u00e4gt die Schuld'', a [[Passion cantata]] by Carl Heinrich Graun: 31 of the pasticcio's 42 movements derive from this composition. The first two movements of the pasticcio are choral movements composed by Telemann. Three movements are linked to Bach. For the remaining six movements no composer is known.<ref name=\"BDS626\">Bach Digital Source [http://www.bachdigital.de/receive/BachDigitalSource_source_00000626?lang=en 00000626] at {{url|www.bachdigital.de}}</ref>\n\nThe text authors of the pasticcio and its components are largely unknown, apart from those of the [[Lutheran hymn]] texts, for instance [[Paul Gerhardt]]'s \"[[O Haupt voll Blut und Wunden]]\" (movement 18), and [[Michael Wei\u00dfe]]'s \"[[Christus, der uns selig macht]]\" (movements 2, 24, 27, 30, 38, 40 and 42). For the free verse no librettist is known. There is no direct quote from the Gospel's Passion texts: the Passion's story isn't told by an Evangelist role in [[recitative]]s, nor in direct speech by any of its characters such as a [[vox Christi]] or [[turba]] choruses, but exclusively hinted at by the reflective texts of the free verse and the chorales. Closest to a Passion narrative in this sense are the interspersed stanzas of \"Christus, der uns selig macht\", which recall successive scenes of [[Christ's Passion]]. Other Biblical models can be indicated for some of the lyrics, for instance {{Sourcetext|source=Bible|version=World English|book=Isaiah|chapter=57|verse=1|range=\u20132}} (\"[[The righteous perishes]]\") for the Bach-movement No. 39, which for its German text does however not use the translation of the [[Luther Bible]], but an alternative translation by an unknown text author.\n\n===''Ein L\u00e4mmlein geht und tr\u00e4gt die Schuld'', GraunWV B:VII:4===\n\nMovements 2\u201331 and 33 of Graun's Passion cantata ''Ein L\u00e4mmlein geht und tr\u00e4gt die Schuld'', [[Catalogues of classical compositions#List of catalogues|GraunWV]] B:VII:4, reappear in the pasticcio as movements 3\u201318, 21\u201323, 25\u201326, 28\u201329, 31\u201337 and 41.<ref name=\"BDS626\" />\n\nGraun's Passion cantata was composed in [[Braunschweig]] between 1725 and 1735, and was popular and widely spread for over a century after its composition.<ref name=\"Bachfest2008\">Aart van der Wal.

[[Friedrich Hofmeister Musikverlag|Hofmeister]], 1997.</ref>\n\nThe only extant manuscript of the pasticcio originated between 1755 and 1759. Where or when it may have been performed in the 18th century is not known. Who assembled the pasticcio is also not known, but presumably someone in the circle of Bach and/or Altnickol. It is even deemed possible that Bach assembled the pasticcio in the 1740s for a performance in Leipzig (the Passion is in two parts as required for [[Passions (Bach)#Good Friday services in Leipzig|Leipzig Passion performances]]).<ref name=\"BDS626\" /><ref name=\"Bachfest2008\" />\n\n==Scoring and structure==\n''Wer ist der, so von Edom k\u00f6mmt'' is set for [[soprano]] (s), [[alto]] (a), [[tenor]] (t) and [[bass (voice type)|bass]] (b) vocal soloists, and a choir consisting of two soprano parts (S), altos (A), tenors (T) and basses (B). The second soprano choral part only appears in the Bach-movement No. 39. The bass and the soprano vocal soloists sing together with the chorus in the opening movement and in the 34th movement respectively.\n\nThe orchestra consists of a [[basso continuo]] (Bc), playing in all movements, and a string section (Str), with two violin parts (Vl) and a viola part, playing in most movements. In the [[tutti]] movements No. 19 and No. 34 two [[traverso]]s (Fl) and two [[oboe]]s (Ob) join the strings and continuo.  The traversos also accompany the soprano 1 part in No. 39. Two [[Oboe d'amore]] players are required for Aria No. 10 only. Bach-movement No. 20 has two unspecified low instruments: the parts can be played by [[violoncello]]s (Vc) or [[bassoon]]s (Bas).\n\nThe first part of the Passion oratorio starts with the two Telemann movements, followed by 16 Graun movements, the last of which, a setting of the \"O Haupt voll Blut und Wunden\" hymn, concludes the first part. The second part (Nos. 19\u201342) starts with the first two Bach-movements, followed by further Graun movements interspersed with six stanzas of the \"Christus, der uns selig macht\" hymn, and as No. 39 the third Bach-movement. Both parts of the Passion-oratorio start with a chorus, and end with a chorale. The choir participates in 19 movements, ten of which are chorale settings.\n\nSoprano, alto and tenor each have three arias. Movement No. 21 is a [[duet]] for soprano and alto. The soprano soloist also sings in the tutti movement with chorus No. 34. The bass singer has an aria and an arioso, and sings with the chorus in the opening movement. There are eleven recitatives, some of which with continuo accompaniment exclusively, to be divided among the soprano, alto and tenor soloists.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+ Movements of the Passion pasticcio ''Wer ist der, so von Edom k\u00f6mmt''\n|+ style=\"background: #E3F6CE;\" | (green:) From Graun's ''Ein L\u00e4mmlein geht und tr\u00e4gt die Schuld'', GraunWV&nbsp;B:VII:4\n|+ style=\"background: #F5F6CE;\" | (yellow:) From Telemann's ''Wer ist der, so von Sodom kommt'', TWV&nbsp;1:1585\n|+ style=\"background: #F6E3CE;\" | (orange-brown:) Bach-movements (BC&nbsp;D&nbsp;10)\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | No.\n! scope=\"col\" | type\n! scope=\"col\" | voices\n! scope=\"col\" | instr.\n! scope=\"col\" | incipit\n! scope=\"col\" | model\n|- style=\"background: #F5F6CE;\" \n| 1. || Chorus || bSATB || 2Ob Str Bc || Wer ist der, so von Edom k\u00f6mmt || TWV 1:1585/1\n|- style=\"background: #F5F6CE;\" \n| 2. || Chorale || SATB || Str Bc || Christus, der uns selig macht || TWV 1:1585/2\n|- style=\"background: #E3F6CE;\" \n| 3. || Chorus || SATB || Str Bc || F\u00fchrwar, er trug unsre Krankheit \n| data-sort-value=\"GraunWV B:VII:4/02\" | GraunWV B:VII:4/2\n|- style=\"background: #E3F6CE;\" \n| 4. || Recitative || s || Str Bc || So steigt mein Jesus in Geduld \n| data-sort-value=\"GraunWV B:VII:4/03\" | GraunWV B:VII:4/3\n|- style=\"background: #E3F6CE;\" \n| 5. || Aria || s || 2Fl Str Bc || Ihr Tropfen, fallt auf meine Brust \n| data-sort-value=\"GraunWV B:VII:4/04\" | GraunWV B:VII:4/4\n|- style=\"background: #E3F6CE;\" \n| 6. || Recitative || t || Bc || Ich wei\u00df, was die ihr selbst gelassene Vernuft \n| data-sort-value=\"GraunWV B:VII:4/05\" | GraunWV B:VII:4/5\n|- style=\"background: #E3F6CE;\" \n| 7. || Chorus || SATB || Str Bc || Wir aber hielten ihn f\u00fcr den \n| data-sort-value=\"GraunWV B:VII:4/06\" | GraunWV B:VII:4/6\n|- style=\"background: #E3F6CE;\" \n| 8. || Chorale || SATB || Str Bc || Herzliebster Jesu, was hast du verbrochen \n| data-sort-value=\"GraunWV B:VII:4/07\" | GraunWV B:VII:4/7\n|- style=\"background: #E3F6CE;\" \n| 9. || Recitative || a [t?] || Bc || Da dich dein J\u00fcnger selbst verr\u00e4t \n| data-sort-value=\"GraunWV B:VII:4/08\" | GraunWV B:VII:4/8\n|- style=\"background: #E3F6CE;\" \n| 10. || Aria || a || 2Oba Str Bc || Was an Strafen ich verschuldet \n| data-sort-value=\"GraunWV B:VII:4/09\" | GraunWV B:VII:4/9 \n|- style=\"background: #E3F6CE;\" \n| 11. || Chorus || SAB || 2Ob Str Bc || Er ist um unserer Missetat willen verwundet || GraunWV B:VII:4/10\n|- style=\"background: #E3F6CE;\" \n| 12. || Chorale || SATB || Str Bc || Du tr\u00e4gst die Strafe meiner Schuld || GraunWV B:VII:4/11\n|- style=\"background: #E3F6CE;\" \n| 13. || Aria || t || 2Fl Str Bc || Harte Marter, schwere Plagen || GraunWV B:VII:4/12\n|- style=\"background: #E3F6CE;\" \n| 14. || Recitative || s || Bc || Jetzt werd ich stark durch Christi Leidenskampf || GraunWV B:VII:4/13\n|- style=\"background: #E3F6CE;\" \n| 15. || Aria || s || Str Bc || Nimmst du die Kron der Dornen an || GraunWV B:VII:4/14\n|- style=\"background: #E3F6CE;\" \n| 16. || Recitative || a || Bc || Ja, ja, es geh' mir wie es will || GraunWV B:VII:4/15\n|- style=\"background: #E3F6CE;\" \n| 17. || Chorus || SATB || Str Bc || Er war der Allerverachteste und Unwerteste || GraunWV B:VII:4/16\n|- style=\"background: #E3F6CE;\" \n| 18. || Chorale || SATB || Str Bc || O Haupt voll Blut und Wunden || GraunWV B:VII:4/17\n|- style=\"background: #F6E3CE;\" \n| 19. || Chorus || SATB || 2Fl 2Ob Str Bc || Herr Jesu Christ, wahr' Mensch und Gott || BC&nbsp;D&nbsp;10/1;

The pasticcio was assembled around 1750.\n\nThe only extant manuscript of the Pasticcio was written by Johann Christoph Farlau and an unknown scribe. Farlau was a pupil of [[Johann Christoph Altnickol]], Bach's son-in-law. Since a reliable differentiation between the handwriting of the master and the pupil was only done in the early 21st century, older scholarship generally attributes the realisation of the Pasticcio to Altnickol and/or indicates Altnickol as the composer of the movements that can not be attributed to other composers.\n\nIn the second half of the 20th century Bach scholarship turned its attention to the pasticcio as it was possibly Bach's elusive \"[[Passions (Bach)#Bach's Passion settings|5th Passion]]\", and for containing previously unknown work by the composer ({{nobreak|[[Bach Compendium|BC]] D 10}}).\n\n==History==\n[[File:Carl Heinrich Graun.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|[[Carl Heinrich Graun]] (1703\u20131759)]]\n[[File:Telemann by Preisler.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|[[Georg Philipp Telemann]] (1681\u20131767)]]\n[[File:J.S.

The first two movements of the pasticcio are choral movements composed by Telemann. Three movements are linked to Bach. For the remaining six movements no composer is known.<ref name=\"BDS626\">Bach Digital Source [http://www.bachdigital.de/receive/BachDigitalSource_source_00000626?lang=en 00000626] at {{url|www.bachdigital.de}}</ref>\n\nThe text authors of the pasticcio and its components are largely unknown, apart from those of the [[Lutheran hymn]] texts, for instance [[Paul Gerhardt]]'s \"[[O Haupt voll Blut und Wunden]]\" (movement 18), and [[Michael Wei\u00dfe]]'s \"[[Christus, der uns selig macht]]\" (movements 2, 24, 27, 30, 38, 40 and 42). For the free verse no librettist is known. There is no direct quote from the Gospel's Passion texts: the Passion's story isn't told by an Evangelist role in [[recitative]]s, nor in direct speech by any of its characters such as a [[vox Christi]] or [[turba]] choruses, but exclusively hinted at by the reflective texts of the free verse and the chorales. Closest to a Passion narrative in this sense are the interspersed stanzas of \"Christus, der uns selig macht\", which recall successive scenes of [[Christ's Passion]]. Other Biblical models can be indicated for some of the lyrics, for instance {{Sourcetext|source=Bible|version=World English|book=Isaiah|chapter=57|verse=1|range=\u20132}} (\"[[The righteous perishes]]\") for the Bach-movement No. 39, which for its German text does however not use the translation of the [[Luther Bible]], but an alternative translation by an unknown text author.\n\n===''Ein L\u00e4mmlein geht und tr\u00e4gt die Schuld'', GraunWV B:VII:4===\n\nMovements 2\u201331 and 33 of Graun's Passion cantata ''Ein L\u00e4mmlein geht und tr\u00e4gt die Schuld'', [[Catalogues of classical compositions#List of catalogues|GraunWV]] B:VII:4, reappear in the pasticcio as movements 3\u201318, 21\u201323, 25\u201326, 28\u201329, 31\u201337 and 41.<ref name=\"BDS626\" />\n\nGraun's Passion cantata was composed in [[Braunschweig]] between 1725 and 1735, and was popular and widely spread for over a century after its composition.<ref name=\"Bachfest2008\">Aart van der Wal.

The composer of these six movements is unknown, but often assumed to be Altnickol.<ref name=\"Hofmeister1997\">[[Johann Christoph Altnickol]], [[Johann Sebastian Bach]], [[Carl Heinrich Graun]], [[Johann Kuhnau]] and [[Georg Philipp Telemann]].

[[Friedrich Hofmeister Musikverlag|Hofmeister]], 1997.</ref>\n\nThe only extant manuscript of the pasticcio originated between 1755 and 1759. Where or when it may have been performed in the 18th century is not known. Who assembled the pasticcio is also not known, but presumably someone in the circle of Bach and/or Altnickol. It is even deemed possible that Bach assembled the pasticcio in the 1740s for a performance in Leipzig (the Passion is in two parts as required for [[Passions (Bach)#Good Friday services in Leipzig|Leipzig Passion performances]]).<ref name=\"BDS626\" /><ref name=\"Bachfest2008\" />\n\n==Scoring and structure==\n''Wer ist der, so von Edom k\u00f6mmt'' is set for [[soprano]] (s), [[alto]] (a), [[tenor]] (t) and [[bass (voice type)|bass]] (b) vocal soloists, and a choir consisting of two soprano parts (S), altos (A), tenors (T) and basses (B). The second soprano choral part only appears in the Bach-movement No. 39. The bass and the soprano vocal soloists sing together with the chorus in the opening movement and in the 34th movement respectively.\n\nThe orchestra consists of a [[basso continuo]] (Bc), playing in all movements, and a string section (Str), with two violin parts (Vl) and a viola part, playing in most movements. In the [[tutti]] movements No. 19 and No. 34 two [[traverso]]s (Fl) and two [[oboe]]s (Ob) join the strings and continuo.  The traversos also accompany the soprano 1 part in No. 39. Two [[Oboe d'amore]] players are required for Aria No. 10 only. Bach-movement No. 20 has two unspecified low instruments: the parts can be played by [[violoncello]]s (Vc) or [[bassoon]]s (Bas).\n\nThe first part of the Passion oratorio starts with the two Telemann movements, followed by 16 Graun movements, the last of which, a setting of the \"O Haupt voll Blut und Wunden\" hymn, concludes the first part. The second part (Nos. 19\u201342) starts with the first two Bach-movements, followed by further Graun movements interspersed with six stanzas of the \"Christus, der uns selig macht\" hymn, and as No. 39 the third Bach-movement. Both parts of the Passion-oratorio start with a chorus, and end with a chorale. The choir participates in 19 movements, ten of which are chorale settings.\n\nSoprano, alto and tenor each have three arias. Movement No. 21 is a [[duet]] for soprano and alto. The soprano soloist also sings in the tutti movement with chorus No. 34. The bass singer has an aria and an arioso, and sings with the chorus in the opening movement. There are eleven recitatives, some of which with continuo accompaniment exclusively, to be divided among the soprano, alto and tenor soloists.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+ Movements of the Passion pasticcio ''Wer ist der, so von Edom k\u00f6mmt''\n|+ style=\"background: #E3F6CE;\" | (green:) From Graun's ''Ein L\u00e4mmlein geht und tr\u00e4gt die Schuld'', GraunWV&nbsp;B:VII:4\n|+ style=\"background: #F5F6CE;\" | (yellow:) From Telemann's ''Wer ist der, so von Sodom kommt'', TWV&nbsp;1:1585\n|+ style=\"background: #F6E3CE;\" | (orange-brown:) Bach-movements (BC&nbsp;D&nbsp;10)\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | No.\n! scope=\"col\" | type\n! scope=\"col\" | voices\n! scope=\"col\" | instr.\n! scope=\"col\" | incipit\n! scope=\"col\" | model\n|- style=\"background: #F5F6CE;\" \n| 1. || Chorus || bSATB || 2Ob Str Bc || Wer ist der, so von Edom k\u00f6mmt || TWV 1:1585/1\n|- style=\"background: #F5F6CE;\" \n| 2. || Chorale || SATB || Str Bc || Christus, der uns selig macht || TWV 1:1585/2\n|- style=\"background: #E3F6CE;\" \n| 3. || Chorus || SATB || Str Bc || F\u00fchrwar, er trug unsre Krankheit \n| data-sort-value=\"GraunWV B:VII:4/02\" | GraunWV B:VII:4/2\n|- style=\"background: #E3F6CE;\" \n| 4. || Recitative || s || Str Bc || So steigt mein Jesus in Geduld \n| data-sort-value=\"GraunWV B:VII:4/03\" | GraunWV B:VII:4/3\n|- style=\"background: #E3F6CE;\" \n| 5. || Aria || s || 2Fl Str Bc || Ihr Tropfen, fallt auf meine Brust \n| data-sort-value=\"GraunWV B:VII:4/04\" | GraunWV B:VII:4/4\n|- style=\"background: #E3F6CE;\" \n| 6. || Recitative || t || Bc || Ich wei\u00df, was die ihr selbst gelassene Vernuft \n| data-sort-value=\"GraunWV B:VII:4/05\" | GraunWV B:VII:4/5\n|- style=\"background: #E3F6CE;\" \n| 7. || Chorus || SATB || Str Bc || Wir aber hielten ihn f\u00fcr den \n| data-sort-value=\"GraunWV B:VII:4/06\" | GraunWV B:VII:4/6\n|- style=\"background: #E3F6CE;\" \n| 8. || Chorale || SATB || Str Bc || Herzliebster Jesu, was hast du verbrochen \n| data-sort-value=\"GraunWV B:VII:4/07\" | GraunWV B:VII:4/7\n|- style=\"background: #E3F6CE;\" \n| 9. || Recitative || a [t?] || Bc || Da dich dein J\u00fcnger selbst verr\u00e4t \n| data-sort-value=\"GraunWV B:VII:4/08\" | GraunWV B:VII:4/8\n|- style=\"background: #E3F6CE;\" \n| 10. || Aria || a || 2Oba Str Bc || Was an Strafen ich verschuldet \n| data-sort-value=\"GraunWV B:VII:4/09\" | GraunWV B:VII:4/9 \n|- style=\"background: #E3F6CE;\" \n| 11. || Chorus || SAB || 2Ob Str Bc || Er ist um unserer Missetat willen verwundet || GraunWV B:VII:4/10\n|- style=\"background: #E3F6CE;\" \n| 12. || Chorale || SATB || Str Bc || Du tr\u00e4gst die Strafe meiner Schuld || GraunWV B:VII:4/11\n|- style=\"background: #E3F6CE;\" \n| 13. || Aria || t || 2Fl Str Bc || Harte Marter, schwere Plagen || GraunWV B:VII:4/12\n|- style=\"background: #E3F6CE;\" \n| 14. || Recitative || s || Bc || Jetzt werd ich stark durch Christi Leidenskampf || GraunWV B:VII:4/13\n|- style=\"background: #E3F6CE;\" \n| 15. || Aria || s || Str Bc || Nimmst du die Kron der Dornen an || GraunWV B:VII:4/14\n|- style=\"background: #E3F6CE;\" \n| 16. || Recitative || a || Bc || Ja, ja, es geh' mir wie es will || GraunWV B:VII:4/15\n|- style=\"background: #E3F6CE;\" \n| 17. || Chorus || SATB || Str Bc || Er war der Allerverachteste und Unwerteste || GraunWV B:VII:4/16\n|- style=\"background: #E3F6CE;\" \n| 18. || Chorale || SATB || Str Bc || O Haupt voll Blut und Wunden || GraunWV B:VII:4/17\n|- style=\"background: #F6E3CE;\" \n| 19. || Chorus || SATB || 2Fl 2Ob Str Bc || Herr Jesu Christ, wahr' Mensch und Gott || BC&nbsp;D&nbsp;10/1;
