Blood creatinine concentrations may also be used alone to calculate the estimated GFR (eGFR).\n\nThe GFR is clinically important because it is a measurement of [[kidney function]].

An increase in serum creatinine can be due to increased ingestion of cooked meat (which contains creatinine converted from creatine by the heat from cooking) or excessive intake of protein and creatine supplements, taken to enhance athletic performance. Intense exercise can increase creatinine by increasing muscle breakdown. Dehydration secondary to an inflammatory process with fever may cause a false increase in creatinine concentrations not related to an actual kidney injury, as in some cases with cholecystitis.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}} Several medications and chromogens can interfere with the assay.

Algorithms to estimate GFR from creatinine concentration and other parameters are discussed in the [[Renal function#Estimated values|renal function]] article.\n\nA concern as of late 2010 relates to the adoption of a new analytical methodology, and a possible impact this may have in clinical medicine.  Most clinical laboratories now align their creatinine measurements against a new standardized [[isotope dilution mass spectrometry]] (IDMS) method to measure serum creatinine. IDMS appears to give lower values than older methods when the serum creatinine values are relatively low, for example 0.7&nbsp;mg/dL. The IDMS method would result in a comparative overestimation of the corresponding calculated GFR in some patients with normal renal function. A few medicines are dosed even in normal renal function on that derived GFR. The dose, unless further modified, could now be higher than desired, potentially causing increased drug-related toxicity. To counter the effect of changing to IDMS, new FDA guidelines have suggested limiting doses to specified maxima with carboplatin, a chemotherapy drug.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fda.gov/AboutFDA/CentersOffices/CDER/ucm228974.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111119090611/https://www.fda.gov/AboutFDA/CentersOffices/CDER/ucm228974.htm|archivedate=2011-11-19|title=Carboplatin dosing|department=Center for Drug Evaluation and Research|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nA 2009 Japanese study found a lower serum creatinine concentration to be associated with an increased risk for the development of type 2 diabetes in Japanese men.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Harita N, Hayashi T, Sato KK |title=Lower serum creatinine is a new risk factor of type 2 diabetes: the Kansai healthcare study |journal=Diabetes Care |volume=32 |issue=3 |pages=424\u20136 |date=March 2009 |pmid=19074997 |doi=10.2337/dc08-1265 |pmc=2646021|display-authors=etal}}</ref>\n\n=== Urine creatinine ===\nMales produce approximately 150&nbsp;\u03bcmol to 200&nbsp;\u03bcmol of creatinine per kilogram of body weight per 24&nbsp;h while females produce approximately 100&nbsp;\u03bcmol/kg/24&nbsp;h to 150&nbsp;\u03bcmol/kg/24&nbsp;h.

Blood creatinine concentrations may also be used alone to calculate the estimated GFR (eGFR).\n\nThe GFR is clinically important because it is a measurement of [[kidney function]].

An increase in serum creatinine can be due to increased ingestion of cooked meat (which contains creatinine converted from creatine by the heat from cooking) or excessive intake of protein and creatine supplements, taken to enhance athletic performance. Intense exercise can increase creatinine by increasing muscle breakdown. Dehydration secondary to an inflammatory process with fever may cause a false increase in creatinine concentrations not related to an actual kidney injury, as in some cases with cholecystitis.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}} Several medications and chromogens can interfere with the assay.

A better estimation of kidney function is given by calculating the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). eGFR can be accurately calculated without a 24-hour urine collection using serum creatinine concentration and some or all of the following variables: sex, age, weight, and race, as suggested by the [[American Diabetes Association]].<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Gross JL, de Azevedo MJ, Silveiro SP, Canani LH, Caramori ML, Zelmanovitz T |title=Diabetic nephropathy: diagnosis, prevention, and treatment |journal=Diabetes Care |volume=28 |issue=1 |pages=164\u201376 |date=January 2005 |pmid=15616252 |doi=10.2337/diacare.28.1.164}}</ref> Many laboratories will automatically calculate eGFR when a creatinine test is requested. Algorithms to estimate GFR from creatinine concentration and other parameters are discussed in the [[Renal function#Estimated values|renal function]] article.\n\nA concern as of late 2010 relates to the adoption of a new analytical methodology, and a possible impact this may have in clinical medicine.  Most clinical laboratories now align their creatinine measurements against a new standardized [[isotope dilution mass spectrometry]] (IDMS) method to measure serum creatinine. IDMS appears to give lower values than older methods when the serum creatinine values are relatively low, for example 0.7&nbsp;mg/dL. The IDMS method would result in a comparative overestimation of the corresponding calculated GFR in some patients with normal renal function. A few medicines are dosed even in normal renal function on that derived GFR. The dose, unless further modified, could now be higher than desired, potentially causing increased drug-related toxicity. To counter the effect of changing to IDMS, new FDA guidelines have suggested limiting doses to specified maxima with carboplatin, a chemotherapy drug.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fda.gov/AboutFDA/CentersOffices/CDER/ucm228974.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111119090611/https://www.fda.gov/AboutFDA/CentersOffices/CDER/ucm228974.htm|archivedate=2011-11-19|title=Carboplatin dosing|department=Center for Drug Evaluation and Research|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nA 2009 Japanese study found a lower serum creatinine concentration to be associated with an increased risk for the development of type 2 diabetes in Japanese men.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Harita N, Hayashi T, Sato KK |title=Lower serum creatinine is a new risk factor of type 2 diabetes: the Kansai healthcare study |journal=Diabetes Care |volume=32 |issue=3 |pages=424\u20136 |date=March 2009 |pmid=19074997 |doi=10.2337/dc08-1265 |pmc=2646021|display-authors=etal}}</ref>\n\n=== Urine creatinine ===\nMales produce approximately 150&nbsp;\u03bcmol to 200&nbsp;\u03bcmol of creatinine per kilogram of body weight per 24&nbsp;h while females produce approximately 100&nbsp;\u03bcmol/kg/24&nbsp;h to 150&nbsp;\u03bcmol/kg/24&nbsp;h.

It was written by all members of the band for their fourth album, ''[[Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends|Viva La Vida or Death and All His Friends]]'' (2008), and was released as the second single from the album.

All the strings are arranged and conducted by violinist [[Davide Rossi]], who is one of the main collaborators of the album. Rossi's strings comprise the main driving force throughout the song, with a strong beginning loop that supports Martin's voice, until the choruses where the symphonic power of the orchestra takes its fullest shape. The prominent chords played by the string section throughout the song (and in the chorus of \"Rainy Day,\" another of the band's songs) are very similar to those used by \"Viva la Vida\" co-producer Brian Eno in his piece \"An Ending (Ascent),\" meaning they could have been suggested partially for the song by Eno.<ref>{{cite AV media notes|title=[[Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends]]|others=[[Coldplay]]|year=2008|publisher=[[EMI]]|location=United Kingdom}}</ref>\n\nThe song is written in the key of [[A-flat major]]. Its main chord progression is D\u266d/E\u266d/A\u266d/Fm. Time signature is 4/4 and the ''tempo'' is 138.\n\n==Release and promotion==\n\n\"Viva la Vida\" was initially released only with [[iTunes Store]] pre-orders of ''Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends'' on 7 May 2008&nbsp;\u2013 the \"new edit\" version of the song&nbsp;\u2013 which led to the song's temporary exclusion from the UK Singles Chart.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.jsonline.com/entertainment/musicandnightlife/29511564.html|title=CD Spotlight|last=M.|first=Jon|date=2008-06-20|work=[[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel]]|accessdate=2008-11-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081228182826/http://www.jsonline.com/entertainment/musicandnightlife/29511564.html|archive-date=28 December 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref> It was released as a download-only single on 25 May 2008, and a physical CD single in Europe on 29 July 2008 to coincide with the release of the single's music videos. \"Viva la Vida\" was well-downloaded in the internet, becoming iTunes' best-selling song of 2008.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/rockdaily/index.php/2008/12/02/coldplay-leona-lewis-top-itunes-2008-sales-chart/|title=Coldplay, Leona Lewis Top iTunes 2008 Sales Chart|last=Kreps|first=Daniel|date=2008-12-02|work=Rolling Stone|accessdate=2008-12-10}}</ref>\n\nThe song was used as part of [[Apple Inc.]]'s [[iPod advertising|iPod + iTunes advertisement campaign]].<ref name=\"ew review\" /><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/ent/music/cdreviews/5840926.html|title=Coldplay channels U2 on new album|last=Guerra|first=Joey|date=2008-06-16|work=[[Houston Chronicle]]|accessdate=2008-11-12}}</ref> Coldplay performed the song live for the first time at the [[2008 MTV Movie Awards]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/rockdaily/index.php/2008/06/02/mtv-movie-awards-reunites-wayne-and-garth-honors-transformers/|title=MTV Movie Awards Reunites Wayne and Garth, Features First TV Performance of New Coldplay Single|last=Kreps|first=Daniel|date=2008-06-02|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|accessdate=2008-11-12}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/wires/2008Jun01/0,4670,MTVMovieAwards,00.html|title=Over-the-top MTV Movie Awards have smoke, no fire|last=Lang|first=Derrick J.|date=2008-06-01|publisher=[[Fox News Channel]]|accessdate=2008-11-12}}</ref> It has since gone on to make many media appearances, including being featured throughout the episode [[List of Medium episodes#Season 5: 2009|\"A Person of Interest\"]] from the [[paranormal]] drama ''[[Medium (TV Series)|Medium]]'', as a song played on the radio in the episode \"We're Not in Kansas Anymore\" from the teen drama ''[[90210 (TV series)|90210]]'',<ref>{{cite news|url=http://newsroom.mtv.com/2008/09/03/90210-premiere-how-does-it-compare-to-the-old-bev/|title='90210\u2032 Premiere: How Does It Compare To The Old Bev?|last=Stolz|first=Kim |date=2008-09-03|publisher=MTV|accessdate=2008-11-12}}</ref> used as [[bumper music]] on [[William Bennett|Bill Bennett]]'s \"Morning in America\" radio talk show, and on the international soundtrack to the Brazilian soap opera ''[[A Favorita]]'' which helped push \"Viva la Vida\" up the charts in Brazil, where the telenovela had been shown.<ref name=\"Som Livre\">{{cite web | last = | first =  | url =http://www.somlivre.com/?1430/produto/CD/A-favorita-Internacional/Varios---A-Favorita\n | title =A Favorita Soundtrack  | publisher = A Favorita International Soundtrack | month= | year=2008 }}</ref> In 2009, [[Solange Knowles]] covered the song.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://music.yahoo.com/promo-42778155-53-20090127-autoplay |title=Pepsi Music |publisher=Music.yahoo.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-29}}</ref> [[Lady Gaga]] also covered the song for [[BBC Radio 1]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uFRg2epy-w |title=Broadcast Yourself |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=2010-08-29}}</ref> A live version of the song appeared on Coldplay's 2009 [[live album]] ''[[LeftRightLeftRightLeft]]''.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/rockdaily/index.php/2009/05/01/coldplay-reward-fans-with-free-live-lp-leftrightleftrightleft/|title=Coldplay Reward Fans With Free Live LP \"LeftRightLeftRightLeft\"|last=Kreps|first=Daniel|date=2009-05-01|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|accessdate=2009-05-21}}</ref>\nIt was also used in an episode entitled \"[[Million Dollar Maybe]]\" of ''[[The Simpsons]]''.

All the strings are arranged and conducted by violinist [[Davide Rossi]], who is one of the main collaborators of the album. Rossi's strings comprise the main driving force throughout the song, with a strong beginning loop that supports Martin's voice, until the choruses where the symphonic power of the orchestra takes its fullest shape. The prominent chords played by the string section throughout the song (and in the chorus of \"Rainy Day,\" another of the band's songs) are very similar to those used by \"Viva la Vida\" co-producer Brian Eno in his piece \"An Ending (Ascent),\" meaning they could have been suggested partially for the song by Eno.<ref>{{cite AV media notes|title=[[Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends]]|others=[[Coldplay]]|year=2008|publisher=[[EMI]]|location=United Kingdom}}</ref>\n\nThe song is written in the key of [[A-flat major]].
