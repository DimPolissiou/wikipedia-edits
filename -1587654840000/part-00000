Thus, cooking can increase protein quality by inactivating or destroying heat-labile antinutritional factors.<ref name=El-Adawy /> Cooking also increases protein digestibility, essential amino acid index, and protein efficiency ratio. Although cooking lowers concentrations of amino acids such as tryptophan, lysine, total aromatic, and sulphur-containing amino acids, their contents are still higher than proposed by the FAO/WHO reference.<ref name=El-Adawy /> Diffusion of reducing sugars, raffinose, sucrose and others into cooking water reduces or completely removes these components.  Cooking also significantly reduces fat and mineral contents. The B vitamins riboflavin, thiamin, niacin, and pyridoxine dissolve into cooking water at differing rates.<ref name=El-Adawy />\n\n===Germination===\nGermination of chickpeas improves protein digestibility, although at a lower level than cooking. Germination degrades proteins to simple peptides, so improves crude protein, nonprotein nitrogen, and crude fiber content. Germination decreases lysine, tryptophan, sulphur and total aromatic amino acids, but most contents are still higher than proposed by the FAO/WHO reference pattern.<ref name=El-Adawy />\n\nOligosaccharides, such as stachyose and raffinose, are reduced in higher amounts during germination than during cooking. Minerals and [[B vitamins]] are retained more effectively during germination than with cooking. Phytic acids are reduced significantly, but trypsin inhibitor, tannin, and saponin reduction is less effective than cooking.<ref name=El-Adawy />\n\n===Autoclaving, microwave cooking, boiling===\nProtein digestibility is improved by all treatments of cooking. Essential amino acids are slightly increased by boiling and microwave cooking when compared to autoclaving and germination. Overall, microwave cooking leads to a significantly lower loss of nutrients compared to autoclaving and boiling.\n\nFinally, all treatments lead to an improved protein digestibility, protein efficiency ratio, and essential amino acid index.

Recent research has indicated that a combination of heat treatment along with the two vital micronutrients, phosphorus and nitrogen, are the most critical components to increasing the overall yield of ''Cicer arietinum''.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nPerennial chickpeas are a fundamental source of nutrition in animal feed as they are high sources of energy and protein for livestock. Unlike other food crops, the perennial chickpea shows a remarkable capacity to change its nutritional content in response to heat cultivation. Treating the chickpea with a constant heat source increases its protein content almost threefold.<ref name=\":1\">Bampidis, V.A. & Christodoulou, V. (2011). Chickpeas (Cicer arietinum L.) in animal nutrition: A review.

Increasing the height and size of chickpea plants involves using micronutrient fertilization with varying doses of inorganic phosphorus and nitrogen.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe level of phosphorus that a chickpea seed is exposed to during its lifecycle has a positive correlation relative to the height of the plant at full maturity.<ref name=\":0\">Mishra, U.S., Sirothia, P., & Bhadoria, U.S. (2009). Effects of phosphorus nutrition on growth and yield of chickpea (''Cicer arietinum'') under rain fed conditions. International Journal of Agricultural and Statistical Sciences, 5(1): 85\u201388.</ref> Increasing the levels of inorganic phosphorus at all doses incrementally increases the height of the chickpea plant. Thus, the seasonal changes in phosphorus soil content as well as periods of drought that are known to be a native characteristic of the dry [[Middle East|Middle-Eastern]] region where the chickpea is most commonly cultivated have a strong effect on the growth of the plant itself. Plant yield is also affected by a combination of phosphorus nutrition and water supply, resulting in a 12% increase in yield of the crop.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nNitrogen nutrition is another factor that affects the yield of ''Cicer arietinum'', although the application itself differs from other perennial crops with regards to the levels administered on the plant. High doses of nitrogen inhibit the yield of the chickpea plant.<ref name=\":2\" /> Drought stress is a likely factor that also inhibits the uptake of nitrogen and subsequent fixation in the roots of ''Cicer arietinum''. The growth of the perennial chickpea is dependent on the balance between nitrogen fixation and assimilation that is also characteristic of many other agricultural plant types. The influence of drought stress, sowing date, and mineral nitrogen supply all have an effect on the yield and size of the plant, with trials showing that ''Cicer arietinum'' differed from other plant species in its capacity to assimilate mineral nitrogen supply from soil during drought stress.<ref name=\":2\">Wery, J., Deschamps, M., & Leger-Cresson, N.

International Journal of Agricultural and Statistical Sciences, 5(1): 85\u201388.</ref> Increasing the levels of inorganic phosphorus at all doses incrementally increases the height of the chickpea plant. Thus, the seasonal changes in phosphorus soil content as well as periods of drought that are known to be a native characteristic of the dry [[Middle East|Middle-Eastern]] region where the chickpea is most commonly cultivated have a strong effect on the growth of the plant itself. Plant yield is also affected by a combination of phosphorus nutrition and water supply, resulting in a 12% increase in yield of the crop.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nNitrogen nutrition is another factor that affects the yield of ''Cicer arietinum'', although the application itself differs from other perennial crops with regards to the levels administered on the plant. High doses of nitrogen inhibit the yield of the chickpea plant.<ref name=\":2\" /> Drought stress is a likely factor that also inhibits the uptake of nitrogen and subsequent fixation in the roots of ''Cicer arietinum''. The growth of the perennial chickpea is dependent on the balance between nitrogen fixation and assimilation that is also characteristic of many other agricultural plant types. The influence of drought stress, sowing date, and mineral nitrogen supply all have an effect on the yield and size of the plant, with trials showing that ''Cicer arietinum'' differed from other plant species in its capacity to assimilate mineral nitrogen supply from soil during drought stress.<ref name=\":2\">Wery, J., Deschamps, M., & Leger-Cresson, N.

Bioavailability of soil inorganic P in the rhizosphere as affected by root-induced chemical changes: A review.

Boron-rich soil resulted in an increase of chickpea yield and size, while soil fertilization with zinc seemed to have no apparent effect on the chickpea yield.<ref>Johnson, S.E., Lauren, J.G., Welch, R.M., & Duxbury, J.M.

The birds spend most of the year in coastal marine ecosystems at high latitudes, and migrate to [[Arctic]] [[tundra]] to breed in June and July. They lay four to seven eggs in a scrape on the ground lined with grass and down.\n\n== Taxonomy and etymology ==\nA heavyset duck with short, thick neck, rather large rounded head, and fairly short but heavy bill. Adult males have a large plate above the bill that creates a bulge in the forehead. Females have a graceful sloping transition between forehead and bill.\n\n\nAdult males are pale on the head and neck and mostly black on the body, with a large orange plate above the red bill. The crown is tinged blue-gray and the face is greenish. The back, underwing, flank and upperwing are white. Adult females are rich rusty brown intricately patterned with black. The cheek and neck are paler brown and the bill is black. Immature males are dark brown with a white chest and orange bill.\n\n\nAt sea, dives deeply to take prey from the sea floor or the underside of sea ice. In shallow tundra lakes, picks prey from the water\u2019s surface, tipping up, seining (straining water through the bill to trap small prey), and probing in mud. Rests, migrates, and forages in flocks, sometimes mixed with other sea ducks.\n\n\nNests in relatively barren tundra of the high Arctic, usually near water, either the coast or interior lakes. Spends several months at molt-migration stopover sites, in fjords or in the open ocean. Winters at the southern edge of sea ice, in Hudson Bay, and in small numbers in farther south.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe king eider is a large sea duck, measuring {{convert|50|\u2013|70|cm|abbr=on}} in length with a [[wingspan]] of {{convert|86|\u2013|102|cm|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"Ogilvie\" /> Males are, on average, heavier than females, with a mean weight of {{convert|1.668|kg|lb|abbr=on}} for males and {{convert|1.567|kg|lb|abbr=on}} for females.<ref name=\"Dunning\" /> An individual bird's mass can vary considerably from season to season\u2014from as little as {{convert|0.9|kg|lb|abbr=on}} to as much as {{convert|2.2|kg|lb|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"Nuttall\" /> Like all eiders, the species is [[sexually dimorphic]]; the male is slightly larger<ref name = \"Madge\"/> and, in breeding [[plumage]], much more colourful than the female.<ref name=\"Nuttall\" /> The male is unmistakable with its mostly black body, buff-tinged white breast and multicoloured head. The head, nape and neck are a pale bluish grey. The cheek is pale green. The bill, separated from the face by a thin black line, is red with a white [[Beak#Nail|nail]] and a large, distinctive yellow knob. Some [[Flight feather#Tertials|tertials]] are curved up and form \"spurs\" along the back.<ref name=BOC />\n\nThe female (occasionally colloquially referred to as a \"queen eider\")<ref name = \"Gordon\"/> is a warm brown colour overall, slightly paler on the head and neck. The [[feather]]s on her upperparts and flanks are marked with blackish [[wiktionary:chevrons|chevrons]], while those on her neck and head bear fine black streaks. She has a buffy spot at the base of her bill and a buffy eye ring which extends into a downward curving stripe behind her eye.<ref name = \"Ogilvie\"/> Her bill is variously described as black<ref name = \"Dunne\"/> or grey, and her legs and feet are greenish grey.<ref name = \"Ogilvie\"/>\n\nJuvenile birds are greyish brown. Late in their first autumn, young males moult into a darker plumage, with white on the breast and rump; it takes them three years to achieve full adult plumage.<ref name = \"Ogilvie\"/>\n\n\nThis bird was created by God beautifully.\n\n== Habitat and range ==\nThe king eider is [[wiktionary:circumpolar|circumpolar]], found throughout the [[Arctic]].<ref name = \"Newton\"/> It breeds on the Arctic coast of Alaska, Canada, Greenland, [[Svalbard]] and Russia, using a variety of [[tundra]] habitats.<ref name = \"Ogilvie\"/> It [[bird migration|winters]] in arctic and subarctic marine areas, most notably in the Bering Sea, the west coast of Greenland, eastern [[Canada]] and northern [[Norway]]. Wintering birds can form large flocks on suitable coastal waters, with some flocks exceeding 100,000 birds. It also occurs annually off the northeastern [[United States]], [[Scotland]] and [[Kamchatka Peninsula|Kamchatka]].\n\n== Behaviour ==\n\n=== Food and feeding ===\nThe king eider's foraging strategies change depending on the season. For much of the year, it is at sea; there, it dives for [[benthic zone|benthic]] invertebrates. During the breeding season, it does more of its foraging on freshwater lakes and ponds, where it dabbles, feeding primarily on small invertebrates plucked from the surface of the water.<ref name=\"Oppel\" /> It feeds  on mollusks, crustaceans like king crabs, and on sea urchins, starfish and sea anemones.\n\n=== Breeding ===\nThe female builds a [[bird nest#Scrape|scrape nest]] on the ground, usually near water. She lines it with vegetation and [[down feather]]s from her own body. She lays a [[clutch (eggs)|clutch]] of {{nowrap|2\u20137 eggs}}, which she alone [[Egg incubation|incubates]] for 22 to {{nowrap|23 days}}.<ref name = \"AllBirdsLife\"/> The young are raised collectively by the females.<ref name=BOC />\n\n=== Voice ===\nThe male's song is a quavering, dove-like cooing, transcribed as ''croo-croo-croo''<ref name = \"Kear\"/> or ''hoo-hoo-hooo''.<ref name = \"Ogilvie\"/> The female makes a variety of low clucks,<ref name = \"Ogilvie\"/> grunts and growls.<ref name = \"Kear\"/>\n\n=== Longevity ===\nThe oldest known king eider was a female that lived at least 18 years 11 months. She was [[bird ringing|ringed (banded)]] as an adult south of [[Gambell, Alaska]] in 1940, and shot in 1958 in [[Utqiagvik, Alaska]].<ref name=\"Clapp\" />\n\n== Conservation and threats ==\nDue to its large population and vast range, the king eider is listed as a species of [[least concern]] by the [[International Union for the Conservation of Nature]].<ref name = \"IUCN\"/> The king eider is one of the species to which the Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds ([[AEWA]]) applies.\n\n== Traditional uses ==\nThe king eider, or ''qengallek'' (pronounced [q\u0259.\u02c8\u014ba\u02d0.\u026c\u0259k]) in [[Yup'ik]], is a regular source of fresh meat in the spring. They begin their migration past the [[Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta]] in late April and are hunted in great numbers. In May, several hundred thousand king eiders pass Point Barrow in northern Alaska on their way to Alaskan and Canadian breeding grounds.\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery>\nFile:King Eiders.jpg|King eiders (male and female) in natural habitat in [[Alaska]] wildlife refuge\nFile:Somateria spectabilis (King Eider - Prachteiderente) - Weltvogelpark Walsrode 2012-15.jpg|The conspicuous head of a male\nFile:Somateria spectabilis (King Eider - Prachteiderente) - Weltvogelpark Walsrode 2012-43.jpg|The gait of a king eider at [[Weltvogelpark Walsrode]] (Walsrode Bird Park)\nFile:King Eider RWD.jpg|Female at [[Alaska Sea Life Center]], Seward, Alaska\nSomateria spectabilis MHNT.ZOO.2010.11.27.3.jpg| ''Somateria spectabilis'' - [[MHNT]]\n</gallery>\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|2|refs=\n<ref name = \"AllBirdsLife\">{{cite web | title = All About Birds: King Eider Life History | url = http://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/King_Eider/lifehistory | publisher = [[Cornell Lab of Ornithology]] |accessdate = 25 May 2015}}</ref>\n<ref name=BOC>{{cite book |last=Godfrey |first=W.

[[Merginae|sea duck]] that breeds along Northern Hemisphere Arctic coasts of northeast [[Europe]], [[North America]] and [[Palearctic|Asia]]. The birds spend most of the year in coastal marine ecosystems at high latitudes, and migrate to [[Arctic]] [[tundra]] to breed in June and July. They lay four to seven eggs in a scrape on the ground lined with grass and down.\n\n== Taxonomy and etymology ==\nWhen he first described the king eider in 1758, in the 10th edition of his opus [[10th edition of Systema Naturae|Systema Naturae]], [[Carl Linnaeus]] assigned it to the [[genus]] ''Anas'', along with the rest of the [[duck]]s.<ref name=\"HBW621\" /> In 1819, [[William Elford Leach]] moved it and the other large eiders to the genus ''[[Somateria]]'', where it has remained since.<ref name=\"ITIS\" /> It is very closely related to the other members of its genus, and is known to [[Hybrid (biology)|hybridise]] with the [[common eider]].<ref name=\"Trefry\" /> Despite its very large range, it is [[monotypic]].<ref name=\"HBW621\" />\n\nThe genus name ''Somateria'' is a combination of the [[Greek language|Greek]] words ''s\u014dma'', meaning \"body\", and ''erion'', meaning \"wool\"; the combination (i.e. \"wooly body\") is a reference to the eider's famously thick, soft down.<ref name=\"Sandrock\" /> The [[Specific name (zoology)|specific name]] ''spectabilis'' is [[Latin]] for \"showy\", \"remarkable\" or \"worth seeing\", a reference to the handsomeness of the adult male's [[plumage]].<ref name=\"Sandrock\" /> The bird's [[common name]], king eider, is a direct translation of its Icelandic name.<ref name=\"Smith\" /> It is called \"king\" because of the orange, crown-like knob above the male's [[beak|bill]]; the male's multicoloured plumage also suggests royal robes.<ref name=\"Sandrock\" /> \"Eider\" is a Dutch, German or Swedish word derived from the Icelandic word ''\u00e6\u00f0ur'' (meaning eider), itself derived from the Old Norse ''\u00e6thr''.<ref name=\"Dict\" />\n\n== Description ==\nThe king eider is a large sea duck, measuring {{convert|50|\u2013|70|cm|abbr=on}} in length with a [[wingspan]] of {{convert|86|\u2013|102|cm|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"Ogilvie\" /> Males are, on average, heavier than females, with a mean weight of {{convert|1.668|kg|lb|abbr=on}} for males and {{convert|1.567|kg|lb|abbr=on}} for females.<ref name=\"Dunning\" /> An individual bird's mass can vary considerably from season to season\u2014from as little as {{convert|0.9|kg|lb|abbr=on}} to as much as {{convert|2.2|kg|lb|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"Nuttall\" /> Like all eiders, the species is [[sexually dimorphic]]; the male is slightly larger<ref name = \"Madge\"/> and, in breeding [[plumage]], much more colourful than the female.<ref name=\"Nuttall\" /> The male is unmistakable with its mostly black body, buff-tinged white breast and multicoloured head. The head, nape and neck are a pale bluish grey. The cheek is pale green. The bill, separated from the face by a thin black line, is red with a white [[Beak#Nail|nail]] and a large, distinctive yellow knob. Some [[Flight feather#Tertials|tertials]] are curved up and form \"spurs\" along the back.<ref name=BOC />\n\nThe female (occasionally colloquially referred to as a \"queen eider\")<ref name = \"Gordon\"/> is a warm brown colour overall, slightly paler on the head and neck. The [[feather]]s on her upperparts and flanks are marked with blackish [[wiktionary:chevrons|chevrons]], while those on her neck and head bear fine black streaks. She has a buffy spot at the base of her bill and a buffy eye ring which extends into a downward curving stripe behind her eye.<ref name = \"Ogilvie\"/> Her bill is variously described as black<ref name = \"Dunne\"/> or grey, and her legs and feet are greenish grey.<ref name = \"Ogilvie\"/>\n\nJuvenile birds are greyish brown. Late in their first autumn, young males moult into a darker plumage, with white on the breast and rump; it takes them three years to achieve full adult plumage.<ref name = \"Ogilvie\"/>\n\n== Habitat and range ==\nThe king eider is [[wiktionary:circumpolar|circumpolar]], found throughout the [[Arctic]].<ref name = \"Newton\"/> It breeds on the Arctic coast of Alaska, Canada, Greenland, [[Svalbard]] and Russia, using a variety of [[tundra]] habitats.<ref name = \"Ogilvie\"/> It [[bird migration|winters]] in arctic and subarctic marine areas, most notably in the Bering Sea, the west coast of Greenland, eastern [[Canada]] and northern [[Norway]]. Wintering birds can form large flocks on suitable coastal waters, with some flocks exceeding 100,000 birds. It also occurs annually off the northeastern [[United States]], [[Scotland]] and [[Kamchatka Peninsula|Kamchatka]].\n\n== Behaviour ==\n\n=== Food and feeding ===\nThe king eider's foraging strategies change depending on the season. For much of the year, it is at sea; there, it dives for [[benthic zone|benthic]] invertebrates. During the breeding season, it does more of its foraging on freshwater lakes and ponds, where it dabbles, feeding primarily on small invertebrates plucked from the surface of the water.<ref name=\"Oppel\" /> It feeds  on mollusks, crustaceans like king crabs, and on sea urchins, starfish and sea anemones.\n\n=== Breeding ===\nThe female builds a [[bird nest#Scrape|scrape nest]] on the ground, usually near water. She lines it with vegetation and [[down feather]]s from her own body. She lays a [[clutch (eggs)|clutch]] of {{nowrap|2\u20137 eggs}}, which she alone [[Egg incubation|incubates]] for 22 to {{nowrap|23 days}}.<ref name = \"AllBirdsLife\"/> The young are raised collectively by the females.<ref name=BOC />\n\n=== Voice ===\nThe male's song is a quavering, dove-like cooing, transcribed as ''croo-croo-croo''<ref name = \"Kear\"/> or ''hoo-hoo-hooo''.<ref name = \"Ogilvie\"/> The female makes a variety of low clucks,<ref name = \"Ogilvie\"/> grunts and growls.<ref name = \"Kear\"/>\n\n=== Longevity ===\nThe oldest known king eider was a female that lived at least 18 years 11 months. She was [[bird ringing|ringed (banded)]] as an adult south of [[Gambell, Alaska]] in 1940, and shot in 1958 in [[Utqiagvik, Alaska]].<ref name=\"Clapp\" />\n\n== Conservation and threats ==\nDue to its large population and vast range, the king eider is listed as a species of [[least concern]] by the [[International Union for the Conservation of Nature]].<ref name = \"IUCN\"/> The king eider is one of the species to which the Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds ([[AEWA]]) applies.\n\nAs eggs and young, king eiders have many predators, including [[glaucous gull]], [[common raven]], [[parasitic jaeger]] and [[Arctic fox]].<ref name = \"Phillips\"/>\n\n== Traditional uses ==\nThe king eider, or ''qengallek'' (pronounced [q\u0259.\u02c8\u014ba\u02d0.\u026c\u0259k]) in [[Yup'ik]], is a regular source of fresh meat in the spring. They begin their migration past the [[Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta]] in late April and are hunted in great numbers. In May, several hundred thousand king eiders pass Point Barrow in northern Alaska on their way to Alaskan and Canadian breeding grounds.\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery>\nFile:King Eiders.jpg|King eiders (male and female) in natural habitat in [[Alaska]] wildlife refuge\nFile:Somateria spectabilis (King Eider - Prachteiderente) - Weltvogelpark Walsrode 2012-15.jpg|The conspicuous head of a male\nFile:Somateria spectabilis (King Eider - Prachteiderente) - Weltvogelpark Walsrode 2012-43.jpg|The gait of a king eider at [[Weltvogelpark Walsrode]] (Walsrode Bird Park)\nFile:King Eider RWD.jpg|Female at [[Alaska Sea Life Center]], Seward, Alaska\nSomateria spectabilis MHNT.ZOO.2010.11.27.3.jpg| ''Somateria spectabilis'' - [[MHNT]]\n</gallery>\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|2|refs=\n<ref name = \"AllBirdsLife\">{{cite web | title = All About Birds: King Eider Life History | url = http://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/King_Eider/lifehistory | publisher = [[Cornell Lab of Ornithology]] |accessdate = 25 May 2015}}</ref>\n<ref name=BOC>{{cite book |last=Godfrey |first=W.

The Marathas captured the region called Kolwan encompassing the [[Jawhar]], [[Mokhada]], [[Wada]], [[Talasari]], [[Vikramgad]] talukas in present day [[Palghar district]] of [[Maharashtra]] and the regions Southern [[Gujarat]] controlled by the Koli king of Ramnagar.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|last=Jadhav|first=Namdevrao|title=Ganimi Kava|publisher=Rajamata Prakashan|year=2014|isbn=978-8191098006|location=Pune|pages=}}</ref><ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|last=Sarkar|first=Jadunath|title=Shivaji and His Times|publisher=Orient Longman|year=1992|isbn=978-81-250-1347-1|location=|pages=}}</ref> \n\n== Background ==\n[[Shivaji|Shivaji Maharaj]] had sacked the city of [[Surat]] in the year 1664. He passed through the territories of Koli Kings of Jawhar and Ramnagar and they had helped him. The [[Treaty of Purandar (1665)|Treaty of Purandar]] was signed between Marathas and the Mughals in the year 1665. After the treaty the Koli Kings became vassals of the Mughal Empire. When Shivaji sacked Surat for a second time in the year 1670, the Koli Kings did not help him. Hence Shivaji wanted to capture the crucial territories of Kolwan which lied just to the South of Surat. Capturing Kolwan would have given Shivaji an access to the Mughal province of Gujarat.<ref name=\":0\" /> Shivaji sent his son Sambhaji and Peshwa Moropant Pingle to capture Kolwan from the Koli Kings. This was the first military campaign in the life of Sambhaji.\n\n== Campaign of the Marathas ==\nSambhaji and Moropant left the capital with a force of 7,000 men. The Marathas controlled regions upto [[Mahuli|Mahuli fort]] in Thane district hence they attacked Kolwan from the South. Sambhaji led the Maratha forces and attacked Koli king Vikramshah's capital city of [[Jawhar]]. Vikramshah fled the city without fighting. He fled to senior Mughal Sardar [[Dilir Khan]] who was stationed at [[Nashik]] with a large army. Rest of the soldiers in Vikramshah's army were assimilated into the Maratha army. The Marathas then attacked the Koli state of Ramnagar in Southern Gujarat and captured the city. The Koli king of Ramnagar [[Som Shah of Ramnagar|Som Shah]] also fled without offering any resistance to invading Maratha army. Marathas had stretched their territories upto 10 miles South of Surat which was highly unaffordable for the Mughals. Hence Diler Khan decided to help the Koli Kings and capture the region once again. <ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" />\n\n== Battle of Vikramgad ==\n{{Main/sandbox|Battle of Vikramgad}}\nDiler Khan immediately sent his General Khijr Khan with an army about 10,000 to capture Kolwan back from the Marathas. Khijr Khan decided to attack the Marathas led by Sambhaji in a full fledged battle. The two forces clashed near the town of \ufffc\ufffc[[Vikramgad]].The battle began with initial skirmishes which were inconclusive. Both the forces clashed with other and a fierce battle went on 2-3 hours. Both sides had heavy casualties but battle was still inconclusive till afternoon. Then the marathas started to gain an upper hand in the battle, inflicting very heavy casualties on the Mughal army. Khijr Khan was himself wounded in the severe battle. Seeing this the Mughal army started to flee towards Nashik. The marathas routed the fleeing mughal army.<ref name=\":0\" /> Victory in the battle of Vikramgad further consolidated the Maratha hold on Kolwan. \n\n== Aftermath ==\nThe Maratha occupation of Kolwan gave them access to the province of Gujarat.

After causing chaos at a wild west themed attraction, Pops ditches them and drives off with a woman ([[Christie Brinkley]] reprising her role as the flirty woman from the movie), and Erica tells Adam and Barry that they're not moving out but are moving on to the next chapter of their lives, not knowing that Beverly overheard them. Meanwhile, Erica worries about \"something important\" Geoff wants to tell her when they return, thinking he wants to break up. After their car breaks down, Adam tells Barry and Erica he will be glad that they're not in the house anymore, causing Beverly to demand that they tell her the truth about going to college and never looking back. She decides they should all just go home. But just then, Geoff picks them up and tells Erica that he just wanted to inform her he's taking a gap year rather than attending college right away. They arrive at Disneyland with Pops joining them after he arrived. After being told by the security guard that the park is closed but that it opens in 15 minutes, Beverly lies about their adventure, and the Goldbergs get into the park before the actual opening and finally enjoy their last family vacation. \n\n'''Featured Songs''': \"[[Holiday Road]]\" by [[Lindsey Buckingham]], \"[[Chariots of Fire (instrumental)|Chariots of Fire]]\" by [[Vangelis]]\n |LineColor=E2E78B \n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|The Goldbergs (season 7)\n |EpisodeNumber = 142\n |EpisodeNumber2 = 2\n |Title = Dana's Back\n |DirectedBy = [[Jay Chandrasekhar]]\n |WrittenBy = {{StoryTeleplay|t=Mike Sikowitz|s=[[Adam F.

Just like the Griswolds in ''[[National Lampoon's Vacation]]'', Beverly insists they drive to [[Disneyland]] rather than fly. After causing chaos at a wild west themed attraction, Pops ditches them and drives off with a woman ([[Christie Brinkley]] reprising her role as the flirty woman from the movie), and Erica tells Adam and Barry that they're not moving out but are moving on to the next chapter of their lives, not knowing that Beverly overheard them. Meanwhile, Erica worries about \"something important\" Geoff wants to tell her when they return, thinking he wants to break up. After their car breaks down, Adam tells Barry and Erica he will be glad that they're not in the house anymore, causing Beverly to demand that they tell her the truth about going to college and never looking back. She decides they should all just go home. But just then, Geoff picks them up and tells Erica that he just wanted to inform her he's taking a gap year rather than attending college right away.

Counselor Perott tells Adam that college isn't a requirement to become a great filmmaker, and even convinces Murray of the same when Bev sends him to complain. This leads to Bev forcing Adam to see Mr. Glascott instead of Mr. Perott. In the end, Mr. Perott says Adam should submit a play as part of his application to NYU, which works.\n'''Featured Song''': \"[[Once in a Lifetime (Talking Heads song)|Once in a Lifetime]]\" by [[Talking Heads]]\n |LineColor=E2E78B\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|The Goldbergs (season 7)\n |EpisodeNumber = 160\n |EpisodeNumber2 = 20\n |Title = The Return of the Formica King \n |DirectedBy = Lea Thompson\n |WrittenBy = Aaron Kaczander\n |OriginalAirDate = {{start date|2020|4|15}}\n |ProdCode = 723\n |Viewers = 4.37<ref name=\"7.20\">{{cite web|url=http://www.showbuzzdaily.com/articles/showbuzzdailys-top-150-wednesday-cable-originals-network-finals-4-15-2020.html|title=Updated: ShowBuzzDaily's Top 150 Wednesday Cable Originals & Network Finals: 4.15.2020|last=Metcalf|first=Mitch|date=April 16, 2020|work=Showbuzz Daily|accessdate=April 16, 2020}}</ref>\n |ShortSummary = Murray gets an offer from Formica Mike ([[Richard Kind]]), the Formica King, to buy out Ottoman Empire. The offer has Beverly seeing visions of a second home on the Jersey Shore, but to her surprise, Murray admits he actually likes going to work despite all his complaints. Murray does, however, agree with Mike that the furniture business is changing and he has to keep up, so he proposes a merger. At William Penn, Ms. Cinoman tells her class there will be no school musical this year because licensing fees have risen too high. Adam proposes that the class perform the musical he and Erica wrote five years ago, but says it needs a closing act. He asks Erica to help him compose the final act, but she is disinterested.

When that fails, Barry enlists Adam's help in pretending to be Hall & Oates, but Barry is confused as to which performer is which and dresses as Oates, just as Adam does. Barry apologizes to Ren, who says their song got lots of donations because people thought it was a comedy act. She also says she's touched that he would go that far to impress her, and kisses him. At home, Beverly overhears Bill Lewis telling Murray that he's finally ready to move on from his ex-wife, and she becomes determined to set him up with someone. Unknown to Beverly, Bill has enlisted help from another yenta, Jane Bales, who sets him up with Dolores ([[Jessica St. Clair]]). The couple seem to be hitting it off, which makes Beverly want to break them up to spite Jane. But when she and Murray share a couples meal with Bill and Dolores, Bev sees that Dolores is actually good for him. Unfortunately, Murray breaks them up because he's concerned about his best friend getting heartbroken again. Murray later reunites Bill and Dolores, and finally opens up to Bill about how much their friendship means.\n |LineColor=E2E78B\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|The Goldbergs (season 7)\n |EpisodeNumber =
