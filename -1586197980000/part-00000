Internally, ''Awakening'' was treated as a last-ditch effort to save the series, as declining sales had led Nintendo to deem it the last game in the series if the game did not meet sales goals. Lucina was part of the team's efforts to rework the series' arch-typical [[medieval fantasy]] setting and revamping it using elements of time-travel; Lucina travels backward in time from a world in ruins to help her father, [[Chrom (Fire Emblem)|Chrom]], work towards a different future.<ref name=\"USGamerRetrospective\">{{cite web|url=https://www.usgamer.net/articles/happy-anniversary-to-fire-emblem-awakening-the-game-that-saved-fire-emblem|title=Happy Anniversary to Fire Emblem Awakening, the Game That Saved Fire Emblem|website=USgamer.net|access-date=February 15, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190328230944/https://www.usgamer.net/articles/happy-anniversary-to-fire-emblem-awakening-the-game-that-saved-fire-emblem|archive-date=March 28, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> Lucina's mother is dependent on the player's choices in [[Fire Emblem Awakening#Battle system|the game's relationship and marriage system]], another revamped system for the game.<ref name=\"ecunews1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ecumenicalnews.com/article/super-smash-bros-4-captain-falcon-lucina-and-robin-join-wii-u-and-3ds-character-list-release-date-rumors-25645|title='Super Smash Bros 4': Captain Falcon, Lucina, and Robin join Wii U and 3DS character list;

Lucina would again appear in future ''Fire Emblem'' titles as well, including ''[[Fire Emblem Fates]]'', ''[[Fire Emblem Heroes]]'', and ''[[Fire Emblem Warriors]]'', though in more of a [[supporting role]] rather than a protagonist with the latter titles.\n\n==History and appearances==\n\n===In ''Fire Emblem Awakening''===\nLucina originates from the [[Nintendo]] and [[Intelligent Systems]] video game ''[[Fire Emblem Awakening]]'', an entry in their long-running ''[[Fire Emblem]]'' series of video games. Internally, ''Awakening'' was treated as a last-ditch effort to save the series, as declining sales had led Nintendo to deem it the last game in the series if the game did not meet sales goals. Lucina was part of the team's efforts to rework the series' arch-typical [[medieval fantasy]] setting and revamping it using elements of time-travel; Lucina travels backward in time from a world in ruins to help her father, [[Chrom (Fire Emblem)|Chrom]], work towards a different future.<ref name=\"USGamerRetrospective\">{{cite web|url=https://www.usgamer.net/articles/happy-anniversary-to-fire-emblem-awakening-the-game-that-saved-fire-emblem|title=Happy Anniversary to Fire Emblem Awakening, the Game That Saved Fire Emblem|website=USgamer.net|access-date=February 15, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190328230944/https://www.usgamer.net/articles/happy-anniversary-to-fire-emblem-awakening-the-game-that-saved-fire-emblem|archive-date=March 28, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> Lucina's mother is dependent on the player's choices in [[Fire Emblem Awakening#Battle system|the game's relationship and marriage system]], another revamped system for the game.<ref name=\"ecunews1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ecumenicalnews.com/article/super-smash-bros-4-captain-falcon-lucina-and-robin-join-wii-u-and-3ds-character-list-release-date-rumors-25645|title='Super Smash Bros 4': Captain Falcon, Lucina, and Robin join Wii U and 3DS character list;

Also, unlike waveguide, microstrip is not enclosed, and is therefore susceptible to cross-talk and unintentional radiation.\n\nFor lowest cost, microstrip devices may be built on an ordinary [[FR-4]] (standard PCB) substrate. However it is often found that the dielectric losses in FR4 are too high at microwave frequencies, and that the [[dielectric constant]] is not sufficiently tightly controlled.

An abrupt 90\u00b0 bend in a microstrip will cause a significant portion of the signal on the strip to be reflected back towards its source, with only part of the signal transmitted on around the bend. One means of effecting a low-reflection bend, is to curve the path of the strip in an arc of radius at least 3 times the strip-width.<ref>{{cite book |first=T.

The percentage mitre is 100x/d]] To a first approximation, an abrupt un-mitred bend behaves as a shunt capacitance placed between the ground plane and the bend in the strip. Mitring the bend reduces the area of metallization, and so removes the excess capacitance. The percentage mitre is the cut-away fraction of the diagonal between the inner and outer corners of the un-mitred bend.\n\nThe optimum mitre for a wide range of microstrip geometries has been determined experimentally by Douville and James.<ref name=\"douville1978\">{{cite journal |first=R.

An abrupt 90\u00b0 bend in a microstrip will cause a significant portion of the signal on the strip to be reflected back towards its source, with only part of the signal transmitted on around the bend. One means of effecting a low-reflection bend, is to curve the path of the strip in an arc of radius at least 3 times the strip-width.<ref>{{cite book |first=T. H. |last=Lee |title=Planar Microwave Engineering |publisher=Cambridge University Press |pages=173\u2013174 |year=2004 |isbn=}}</ref> However, a far more common technique, and one which consumes a smaller area of substrate, is to use a mitred bend.\n\n[[Image:microstrip-bend.svg|thumb|left|200px|Microstrip 90\u00b0 mitred bend. The percentage mitre is 100x/d]] To a first approximation, an abrupt un-mitred bend behaves as a shunt capacitance placed between the ground plane and the bend in the strip. Mitring the bend reduces the area of metallization, and so removes the excess capacitance. The percentage mitre is the cut-away fraction of the diagonal between the inner and outer corners of the un-mitred bend.\n\nThe optimum mitre for a wide range of microstrip geometries has been determined experimentally by Douville and James.<ref name=\"douville1978\">{{cite journal |first=R.

They report a [[VSWR]] of better than 1.1 (i.e., a return loss better than &minus;26&nbsp;dB) for any percentage mitre within 4% (of the original <math>d</math>) of that given by the formula. At the minimum <math>w/h</math> of 0.25, the percentage mitre is 98.4%, so that the strip is very nearly cut through.\n\nFor both the curved and mitred bends, the electrical length is somewhat shorter than the physical path-length of the strip.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Distributed element filter]]\n* [[Slow-wave coupler]]\n* [[Spurline]], a microstrip notch-filter\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20140716195524/http://www.microwaves101.com/ENCYCLOPEDIA/microstrip.cfm Microstrip in Microwave Encyclopedia]\n* [http://mcalc.sourceforge.net/ Microstrip Analysis/Synthesis Calculator]\n\n[[Category:Microwave technology]]\n[[Category:Planar transmission lines]]\n[[Category:Printed circuit board manufacturing]]\n", "name_user": "2601:681:4f02:6140:a499:b38:b3d6:9b1a", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microstrip"}
