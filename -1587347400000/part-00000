Notice that Stoughton Lake has yet to be built, its future location near the photo's center. The Jennerstown Speedway is visibly clearly at lower left.]]\n\nJennerstown was first settled in the late 18th century as a stage coach stop on the Forbes Road, one of the first roads constructed by English-speaking settlers over the Allegheny Mountains. The town, originally named Laurel Hill, was later renamed Jennerville in honor of Dr. [[Edward Jenner]], discoverer of the smallpox vaccine. Later, Jennerville became Jennerstown. The town and vicinity boast several buildings about 200 years old, which is not common in the surrounding area.\n\nThroughout its history, Jennerstown has served primarily as a wayside for travelers and as a farming community. Its post office was established in 1832, initially under the name of Laurel Hill.  The village contained seven or eight houses, a store and a tavern at that time. Jennerstown incorporated as a borough in 1874. Jennerstown has never been a large town, and its current population represents a peak.\n\nJennerstown is home to the Mountain Playhouse, one of the oldest venues for summer stock theatre in the United States. The Mountain Playhouse has maintained a full schedule of live theatre productions nightly from May through October each year for the last seventy-seven years. Jennerstown Speedway is a popular summer destination for stock car racing.\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.jennerstownboro.com Borough website]\n* [https://www.jennerstown.org/ The Jennerstown Speedway]\n* [http://www.mountainplayhouse.org/playhouse/art.html Jenner Art Gallery]\n* [http://www.mountainplayhouse.com/ Mountain Playhouse]\n* Jennerstown SpeedTrap [https://www.speedtrap.org/pennsylvania/ info]\n\n{{Somerset County, Pennsylvania}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Boroughs in Somerset County, Pennsylvania]]\n[[Category:Populated places established in 1822]]\n[[Category:1822 establishments in Pennsylvania]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox settlement\n|official_name = Jennerstown, Pennsylvania\n|other_name = \n|native_name = \n|nickname = \n|settlement_type = Borough\n|motto = \n|image_skyline = John Dennison House in Jennerstown.jpg\n|imagesize = 250px\n|image_caption = 1806 tavern on the [[U.S. Route 30|Pennsylvania Wagon Road]]\n|image_flag = \n|flag_size = \n|image_seal = \n|seal_size = \n|image_shield = \n|shield_size = \n|image_blank_emblem = \n|blank_emblem_size = \n|pushpin_map = Pennsylvania\n|pushpin_label_position = none<!-- the position of the pushpin label: left, right, top, bottom, none -->\n|pushpin_map_caption = \n|pushpin_mapsize = \n<!-- Location ------------------>\n|subdivision_type = [[List of sovereign states|Country]]\n|subdivision_name = United States\n|subdivision_type1 = [[U.S. state|State]]\n|subdivision_name1 = [[Pennsylvania]]\n|subdivision_type2 = [[List of counties in Pennsylvania|County]]\n|subdivision_name2 = [[Somerset County, Pennsylvania|Somerset]]\n|government_footnotes = \n|government_type = Borough Council\n|leader_title = Mayor\n|leader_name = \n|leader_title1 = \n|leader_name1 = \n|leader_title2 = \n|leader_name2 = \n|leader_title3 = \n|leader_name3 = \n|leader_title4 = \n|leader_name4 = \n|established_title = Settled\n|established_date = 1822\n|established_title1 = Incorporated\n|established_date1 = 1874\n|area_magnitude = \n|unit_pref  = Imperial\n|area_footnotes = <ref name=\"CenPopGazetteer2016\">{{cite web|title=2017 U.S. Gazetteer Files|url=https://www2.census.gov/geo/docs/maps-data/data/gazetteer/2017_Gazetteer/2017_gaz_place_42.txt|publisher=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=Mar 24, 2019}}</ref>\n|area_total_km2 = 5.15\n|area_land_km2 = 4.98\n|area_water_km2 = 0.17\n|area_total_sq_mi = 1.99\n|area_land_sq_mi = 1.92\n|area_water_sq_mi = 0.07\n|area_water_percent = \n|population_as_of = [[2010 United States Census|2010]]\n|population_footnotes = \n|population_note = \n|population_total = 695\n|population_density_km2 = 131.93\n|population_density_sq_mi = 341.65\n|timezone = [[Eastern Time Zone|Eastern (EST)]]\n|utc_offset = -5\n|timezone_DST = EDT\n|utc_offset_DST = -4\n|coordinates   = {{coord|40|09|42|N|79|03|46|W|region:US_type:city|display=inline,title}}\n|elevation_footnotes = \n|elevation_m = \n|elevation_ft = \n|postal_code_type = [[Zip code]]\n|postal_code = 15547\n|area_code = [[Area code 814|814]]\n|website = {{URL|http://www.jennerstownboro.com}}\n|footnotes = \n|pop_est_as_of = 2018\n|pop_est_footnotes = <ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\"/>\n|population_est = 649\n|blank_name = [[Federal Information Processing Standards|FIPS code]]\n|blank_info = 42-38048\n|image_map = File:Somerset County Pennsylvania Incorporated and Unincorporated areas Jennerstown Highlighted.svg\n|map_caption = Location of Jennerstown in Somerset County, Pennsylvania.\n}}\n\n'''Jennerstown''' is a borough in [[Somerset County, Pennsylvania|Somerset County]], [[Pennsylvania]], United States.

Notice that Stoughton Lake has yet to be built, its future location near the photo's center. The Jennerstown Speedway is visibly clearly at lower left.]]\n\nJennerstown was first settled in the late 18th century as a stage coach stop on the Forbes Road, one of the first roads constructed by English-speaking settlers over the Allegheny Mountains. The town, originally named Laurel Hill, was later renamed Jennerville in honor of Dr. [[Edward Jenner]], discoverer of the smallpox vaccine. Later, Jennerville became Jennerstown. The town and vicinity boast several buildings about 200 years old, which is not common in the surrounding area.\n\nThroughout its history, Jennerstown has served primarily as a wayside for travelers and as a farming community. Its post office was established in 1832, initially under the name of Laurel Hill.  The village contained seven or eight houses, a store and a tavern at that time. Jennerstown incorporated as a borough in 1874. Jennerstown has never been a large town, and its current population represents a peak.\n\nJennerstown is home to the Mountain Playhouse, one of the oldest venues for summer stock theatre in the United States. The Mountain Playhouse has maintained a full schedule of live theatre productions nightly from May through October each year for the last seventy-seven years. Jennerstown Speedway is a popular summer destination for stock car racing.\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.jennerstownboro.com Borough website]\n* [https://www.jennerstown.org/ The Jennerstown Speedway]\n* [http://www.mountainplayhouse.org/playhouse/art.html Jenner Art Gallery]\n* [http://www.mountainplayhouse.com/ Mountain Playhouse]\n* Jennerstown SpeedTrap [https://www.speedtrap.org/pennsylvania/ info]\n\n{{Somerset County, Pennsylvania}}\n\n[[Category:Boroughs in Somerset County, Pennsylvania]]\n[[Category:Populated places established in 1822]]\n[[Category:1822 establishments in Pennsylvania]]\n", "name_user": "Ser Amantio di Nicolao", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eExternal links:add authority control", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jennerstown,_Pennsylvania"}

Philadelphia along the [[Pennsylvania Route 611|Route 611]] corridor between [[Abington Township, Montgomery County, Pennsylvania|Abington]] and [[Cheltenham Township, Pennsylvania|Cheltenham]] Townships. The Borough was settled in about 1697 and incorporated on December 8, 1874 when approximately {{convert|248|acre|km2}} was taken from Abington Township. Today, the Borough is approximately 0.58 square miles and is home to 4,500 residents.\n\nThe Borough is a mostly [[residential community]] that is separated into East and West by the Business District that runs along and surrounds [[Old York Road]] (Route 611) corridor. On the east side of Old York Road, residential development is predominantly characterized by larger detached single-family homes on lots larger than the Borough average. On the southeast side of York Road, there is a small mixed concentration of row homes, [[duplex (building)|duplexes]], and single-family residences. The majority of the residential development, however, is located to the west of York Road. This area consists of a traditional small town mix of detached single-family homes, duplexes, and row homes. Located throughout this area are several multi-family apartment buildings that are residential rental properties. At the center of this residential area are the Jenkintown Elementary School and the Jenkintown High School.\n\nThe Jenkintown Fire Department consists of two fire companies founded more than 125 years ago. The Jenkintown Fire Department is a totally [[volunteer fire department|volunteer department]] consisting of the Pioneer Fire Company #1 and the Independent Fire Company #2. The Pioneer Company was organized in 1884 and the Independent Company was organized in 1889, an artifact of the historical split between Catholics and Protestants in the population of the borough. The two fire companies have a total membership of approximately 150 with 50 members composing the active firefighting crew.\n\nElements of the British army passed through Jenkintown en route to the [[Battle of White Marsh]] in early December 1777.\n\nThe [[Jenkins' Town Lyceum Building]], [[Jenkintown-Wyncote station]], and [[Strawbridge and Clothier Store]] are listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].<ref name=\"nris\">{{NRISref|version=2010a}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nJenkintown borough is located at {{Coord|40|5|46|N|75|7|46|W|type:city}} (40.096060, -75.129415).<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/gazetteer-files.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref> According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the borough has a total area of {{convert|0.6|sqmi|km2}}, all land.

Philadelphia along the [[Pennsylvania Route 611|Route 611]] corridor between [[Abington Township, Montgomery County, Pennsylvania|Abington]] and [[Cheltenham Township, Pennsylvania|Cheltenham]] Townships. The Borough was settled in about 1697 and incorporated on December 8, 1874 when approximately {{convert|248|acre|km2}} was taken from Abington Township. Today, the Borough is approximately 0.58 square miles and is home to 4,500 residents.\n\nThe Borough is a mostly [[residential community]] that is separated into East and West by the Business District that runs along and surrounds [[Old York Road]] (Route 611) corridor. On the east side of Old York Road, residential development is predominantly characterized by larger detached single-family homes on lots larger than the Borough average. On the southeast side of York Road, there is a small mixed concentration of row homes, [[duplex (building)|duplexes]], and single-family residences. The majority of the residential development, however, is located to the west of York Road. This area consists of a traditional small town mix of detached single-family homes, duplexes, and row homes. Located throughout this area are several multi-family apartment buildings that are residential rental properties. At the center of this residential area are the Jenkintown Elementary School and the Jenkintown High School.\n\nThe Jenkintown Fire Department consists of two fire companies founded more than 125 years ago. The Jenkintown Fire Department is a totally [[volunteer fire department|volunteer department]] consisting of the Pioneer Fire Company #1 and the Independent Fire Company #2. The Pioneer Company was organized in 1884 and the Independent Company was organized in 1889, an artifact of the historical split between Catholics and Protestants in the population of the borough. The two fire companies have a total membership of approximately 150 with 50 members composing the active firefighting crew.\n\nElements of the British army passed through Jenkintown en route to the [[Battle of White Marsh]] in early December 1777.\n\nThe [[Jenkins' Town Lyceum Building]], [[Jenkintown-Wyncote station]], and [[Strawbridge and Clothier Store]] are listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].<ref name=\"nris\">{{NRISref|version=2010a}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nJenkintown borough is located at {{Coord|40|5|46|N|75|7|46|W|type:city}} (40.096060, -75.129415).<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/gazetteer-files.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref> According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the borough has a total area of {{convert|0.6|sqmi|km2}}, all land.

Its history dates back to January 22, 1828 when it was created as a township from the old Township of Mifflin. At that time, the community was called \"Jefferson Township\" in honor of Thomas Jefferson.\n\nIn 1845, Snowden Township was formed from a part of Jefferson Township. Population of the township in 1860 was 1,601 persons, in 1870 it was 2,066 persons, and it reached a total population of 3,227 persons in 1880 (about equal to the population of 1930). Jefferson Township became a First Class Township in 1914, and in 1950 Jefferson was chartered as a borough. The borough of [[Pleasant Hills, Pennsylvania|Pleasant Hills]] seceded from Jefferson Township in 1947 and by so doing, drastically reduced the population and urbanized area of the township.\n\nJefferson Hills is located along the southern border of [[Allegheny County, Pennsylvania|Allegheny County]] and is primarily residential in nature, with approximately one-third of its area presently being used for residential purposes. The residential use is primarily single-family dwellings with slightly over one percent being multiple-family units. Another third of the borough exists in the form of open space and or vacant ground, with the balance being made up of industrial, commercial, mining, and farming land uses.\n\nThe major portion of Jefferson Hills drains into two watersheds, the [[Peters Creek (Pennsylvania)|Peters Creek]] watershed, which ultimately drains into the [[Monongahela River]] at [[Clairton, Pennsylvania|Clairton]], and the Calamity Hollow and [[West Elizabeth, Pennsylvania|West Elizabeth]] watershed, which drains to the Monongahela River in the vicinity of West Elizabeth.\n\nPresent development has occurred almost exclusively in the flat upland areas. These developments are scattered and separated by large open tracts and or hills and valleys.<ref>{{cite web |title=Yohogania County Jefferson Borough History |url=http://www.15122.com/YOHOGANIA/JeffersonHistory/jeffersonhistory.htm |access-date=2009-06-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020611181123/http://www.15122.com/YOHOGANIA/JeffersonHistory/jeffersonhistory.htm |archive-date=2002-06-11 |url-status=dead }}</ref>}}\n\nThe area was the geographic base of the Peters Creek Rangers during the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Yohogania County |url=http://www.15122.com/YOHOGANIA/JeffersonHistory/jeffersonhistory3.htm |access-date=2008-06-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020117002546/http://15122.com/YOHOGANIA/JeffersonHistory/jeffersonhistory3.htm |archive-date=2002-01-17 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==Education==\n[[File:Thomas Jefferson High School.jpg|thumb|left | Thomas Jefferson High School]]\n\n===West Jefferson Hills School District===\n{{Main|West Jefferson Hills School District}}The West Jefferson Hills School District is a midsized, suburban, public school system for residents of Jefferson Hills, West Elizabeth, and Pleasant Hills.

Its history dates back to January 22, 1828 when it was created as a township from the old Township of Mifflin. At that time, the community was called \"Jefferson Township\" in honor of Thomas Jefferson.\n\nIn 1845, Snowden Township was formed from a part of Jefferson Township. Population of the township in 1860 was 1,601 persons, in 1870 it was 2,066 persons, and it reached a total population of 3,227 persons in 1880 (about equal to the population of 1930). Jefferson Township became a First Class Township in 1914, and in 1950 Jefferson was chartered as a borough. The borough of [[Pleasant Hills, Pennsylvania|Pleasant Hills]] seceded from Jefferson Township in 1947 and by so doing, drastically reduced the population and urbanized area of the township.\n\nJefferson Hills is located along the southern border of [[Allegheny County, Pennsylvania|Allegheny County]] and is primarily residential in nature, with approximately one-third of its area presently being used for residential purposes. The residential use is primarily single-family dwellings with slightly over one percent being multiple-family units. Another third of the borough exists in the form of open space and or vacant ground, with the balance being made up of industrial, commercial, mining, and farming land uses.\n\nThe major portion of Jefferson Hills drains into two watersheds, the [[Peters Creek (Pennsylvania)|Peters Creek]] watershed, which ultimately drains into the [[Monongahela River]] at [[Clairton, Pennsylvania|Clairton]], and the Calamity Hollow and [[West Elizabeth, Pennsylvania|West Elizabeth]] watershed, which drains to the Monongahela River in the vicinity of West Elizabeth.\n\nPresent development has occurred almost exclusively in the flat upland areas. These developments are scattered and separated by large open tracts and or hills and valleys.<ref>{{cite web |title=Yohogania County Jefferson Borough History |url=http://www.15122.com/YOHOGANIA/JeffersonHistory/jeffersonhistory.htm |access-date=2009-06-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020611181123/http://www.15122.com/YOHOGANIA/JeffersonHistory/jeffersonhistory.htm |archive-date=2002-06-11 |url-status=dead }}</ref>}}\n\nThe area was the geographic base of the Peters Creek Rangers during the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Yohogania County |url=http://www.15122.com/YOHOGANIA/JeffersonHistory/jeffersonhistory3.htm |access-date=2008-06-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020117002546/http://15122.com/YOHOGANIA/JeffersonHistory/jeffersonhistory3.htm |archive-date=2002-01-17 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==Education==\n[[File:Thomas Jefferson High School.jpg|thumb|left | Thomas Jefferson High School]]\n\n===West Jefferson Hills School District===\n{{Main article|West Jefferson Hills School District}}The West Jefferson Hills School District is a midsized, suburban, public school system for residents of Jefferson Hills, West Elizabeth, and Pleasant Hills.
