{"title_page": "Lakes Plain languages", "text_new": "{{short description|Papuan language family}}\n{{Infobox language family\n|name=Lakes Plain \n|region=[[Lakes Plains]], [[New Guinea]]\n|familycolor=Papuan\n|family = one of the world's primary [[language family|language families]]\n|glotto=lake1255\n|glottorefname=Lakes Plain \n}}\n\nThe '''Lakes Plain languages''' are a [[language family|family]] of [[Papuan languages]], spoken in the [[Lakes Plain]] of Indonesian [[New Guinea]]. They are notable for being heavily tonal and for their lack of [[nasal consonant#Lack|nasal consonants]].\n\n==Classification==\nThe Lakes Plain languages were tentatively grouped by [[Stephen Wurm]] with the [[Tor languages]] in his [[Trans\u2013New Guinea languages|Trans\u2013New Guinea]] proposal.  Clouse (1997) rejected this connection to the Tor languages and grouped them with the [[Geelvink Bay languages]]. [[Malcolm Ross (linguist)|Malcolm Ross]] classifies the languages as an independent family, a position confirmed by Timothy Usher.\n\nBecause of the apparent phonological similarities and sharing of stable basic words such as \u2018louse\u2019, [[William A. Foley]] speculates the potential likelihood of a distant relationship shared between the [[Skou languages|Skou]] and Lakes Plain families, but no formal proposals linking the two families have been made due to insufficient evidence.<ref name=\"Foley-NWNG\"/> Additionally according to Foley, based on some lexical and phonological similarities, the [[Keuw language]] (currently unclassified) may also possibly share a deep relationship with the Lakes Plain languages.\n\nLike the [[East Geelvink Bay languages|East Cenderawasih Bay]], [[Trans-New Guinea]], and [[South Bougainville languages|South Bougainville]] language families, Lakes Plain languages have [[Ergative case|ergative]] [[case marking]] systems. In contrast, most languages of northern [[Papua New Guinea]] have accusative case marking systems.<ref name=\"Foley-Typology\">{{cite book |last=Foley |first=William A. |authorlink=William A.

Clouse had placed them closest to Papasena and to Eritai, respectively, and they might form dialect clusters with those languages.\n\nThere are particular questions about the inclusion of Saponi, Kehu and Tause.\n\n==Pronouns==\nThe pronouns Ross reconstructs for proto-Tariku are,\n\n:{| class=wikitable\n|-\n| '''I''' || ''*a/*i'' || '''we''' || ''*a/*ai''\n|-\n| '''thou''' || ''*de'' || '''you''' || ''*da''\n|-\n| '''s/he''' || ''*au'' || '''they''' || ?\n|}\n\nThe corresponding \"I\" and \"thou\" pronouns are proto\u2013East Lake Plain ''*a, *do,'' Awera ''yai, nai'' (the latter from ''*dai;'' compare also ''e'' \"we\"), and Rasawa ''e-, de-.'' Saponi shares no pronouns with the Lakes Plain family; indeed its pronouns ''mamire'' \"I, we\" and ''ba'' \"thou\" are remenincent of [[East Bird's Head \u2013 Sentani languages|proto\u2013East Bird's Head]] ''*meme'' \"we\" and ''*ba'' \"thou\". However, Saponi shares half its basic lexical vocabulary with Rasawa, and Ross left it in the Lakes Plain family pending further investigation. The Tause language was also previously grouped amongst the Tariku group of Lakes Plain languages.  Ross transferred it to the [[East Bird's Head \u2013 Sentani languages]] on the basis of pronoun similarities in hopes that this would promote further research.\n\nBelow are pronouns in selected Lakes Plain languages as given by Foley (2018):<ref name=\"Foley-NWNG\"/>\n\n:{| {{table}}\n!  !! [[Awera language|Awera]] !! [[Kirikiri language|Kirikiri]] !! [[Iau language|Iau]] !! [[Duvle language|Duvle]] !! [[Obokuitai language|Obokuitai]] !!

While Papuan languages typically have at least two nasal phonemes, this is not the case for Lakes Plain languages. Although phonetic nasals do exist in most Lakes Plain languages, they do not contrast with the corresponding voiced stops. Doutai, Sikaritai, Obokuitai and Foau lack even phonetic nasals. Additionally, no Lakes Plain language has a liquid phoneme. Clouse (1997) reconstructs a typologically remarkable consonant inventory for the ancestor of Lakes Plain, consisting entirely of only five stops:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! \n![[Labial consonant|Labial]]\n![[Alveolar consonant|Alveolar]]\n![[Velar consonant|Velar]]\n|-align=\"center\"\n! Voiceless [[Stop consonant|Stop]]\n| *p \n| *t\n| *k\n|-align=\"center\"\n![[Voice (phonetics)|Voiced]] Stop\n| *b\n| *d\n|\n|}\n\nThis results in Lakes Plain languages having high [[functional load]], meaning that there are many words with small distinctions in sounds.\n\n===Vowels===\nMany of the languages have very high constricted (fricativised) vowels; in Doutai and Kirikiri these constitute separate phonemes from /i/ and /u/. The fricativised vowels seem to have developed from deletion of a following consonant.\n\nClouse (1997) reconstructs a five-vowel system for proto-Lakes Plain, not unlike Japanese or Spanish:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!\n! Front\n! Back\n|-align=\"center\"\n! High\n| *i \n| *u\n|-align=\"center\"\n! Mid\n| *e\n| *o\n|-align=\"center\"\n! Low\n| *a\n|\n|}\n\n===Tone===\nLakes Plain languages are all tonal. (The [[Skou languages]] and [[Kainantu-Goroka languages]] are other [[Papuan languages]] possessing contrastive [[tone (linguistics)|tone]].) Clouse and Clouse (1993) reconstruct tone (high level \"H\" and low level \"L\") in proto-Lakes Plain.<ref name=\"Foley-NWNG\"/>\n\n[[Duvle language|Duvle]] and [[Sikaritai language|Sikaritai]] have only two tones, high and low, but all other Lakes Plain languages have more than two tones. All West Tariku languages have both rising and falling tones.<ref name=\"Clouse-LakesPlain\"/>\n\n[[Iau language|Iau]] is the most tonally complex Lakes Plain language. Unlike other Lakes Plain languages which can be disyllabic or trisyllabic, Iau word structure is predominantly monosyllabic. Iau has eight phonemic tones, transcribed by Bateman using numerical [[Chao Tones|Chao tones]] (usually used with East Asian languages): high (44), mid (33), high-rising (45), low-rising (23), high-to-low-falling (42), high-to-mid-falling (43), mid-to-low-falling (32), and falling-rising (423).<ref name=\"Foley-NWNG\"/> Four of the eight Iau tones occur on short vowels, while the remaining four occur on long vowels and often correspond to disyllabic words in other Lakes Plain languages.<ref name=\"Clouse-LakesPlain\"/> (See [[Iau language#Tone]].)\n\n==Morphology==\nUnlike most Papuan languages to the east, words in Lakes Plain languages do not have [[grammatical gender|gender]] or [[inflection]]. [[Bauzi language|Bauzi]], an East Geelvink Bay language spoken to the northwest of the Lakes Plain family, also does not have gender.<ref name=\"Foley-NWNG\">{{cite book |last=Foley |first=William A. |editor1-last=Palmer |editor1-first=Bill |date=2018 |title=The Languages and Linguistics of the New Guinea Area: A Comprehensive Guide |chapter=The languages of Northwest New Guinea |series= The World of Linguistics |volume=4 |location=Berlin |publisher=De Gruyter Mouton |pages=433\u2013568 |isbn=978-3-11-028642-7}}</ref> As analytic isolating languages, there is not much morphology.\n\n==Basic vocabulary==\nBasic vocabulary of the Lakes Plain languages ([[Rasawa language|Rasawa]], [[Kirikiri language|Kirikiri]], [[Iau language|Iau]], [[Duvle language|Duvle]], [[Obokuitai language|Obokuitai]], [[Diebroud language|Diebroud]]) listed in [[William A.

They are notable for being heavily tonal and for their lack of [[nasal consonant#Lack|nasal consonants]].\n\n==Classification==\nThe Lakes Plain languages were tentatively grouped by [[Stephen Wurm]] with the [[Tor languages]] in his [[Trans\u2013New Guinea languages|Trans\u2013New Guinea]] proposal.  Clouse (1997) rejected this connection to the Tor languages and grouped them with the [[Geelvink Bay languages]]. [[Malcolm Ross (linguist)|Malcolm Ross]] classifies the languages as an independent family, a position confirmed by Timothy Usher.\n\nBecause of the apparent phonological similarities and sharing of stable basic words such as \u2018louse\u2019, [[William A. Foley]] speculates the potential likelihood of a distant relationship shared between the [[Skou languages|Skou]] and Lakes Plain families, but no formal proposals linking the two families have been made due to insufficient evidence.<ref name=\"Foley-NWNG\"/> Additionally according to Foley, based on some lexical and phonological similarities, the [[Keuw language]] (currently unclassified) may also possibly share a deep relationship with the Lakes Plain languages.\n\nLike the [[East Geelvink Bay languages|East Cenderawasih Bay]], [[Trans-New Guinea]], and [[South Bougainville languages|South Bougainville]] language families, Lakes Plain languages have [[Ergative case|ergative]] [[case marking]] systems. In contrast, most languages of northern [[Papua New Guinea]] have accusative case marking systems.<ref name=\"Foley-Typology\">{{cite book |last=Foley |first=William A. |authorlink=William A.

Clouse had placed them closest to Papasena and to Eritai, respectively, and they might form dialect clusters with those languages.\n\nThere are particular questions about the inclusion of Saponi, Kehu and Tause.\n\n==Pronouns==\nThe pronouns Ross reconstructs for proto-Tariku are,\n\n:{| class=wikitable\n|-\n| '''I''' || ''*a/*i'' || '''we''' || ''*a/*ai''\n|-\n| '''thou''' || ''*de'' || '''you''' || ''*da''\n|-\n| '''s/he''' || ''*au'' || '''they''' || ?\n|}\n\nThe corresponding \"I\" and \"thou\" pronouns are proto\u2013East Lake Plain ''*a, *do,'' Awera ''yai, nai'' (the latter from ''*dai;'' compare also ''e'' \"we\"), and Rasawa ''e-, de-.'' Saponi shares no pronouns with the Lakes Plain family; indeed its pronouns ''mamire'' \"I, we\" and ''ba'' \"thou\" are remenincent of [[East Bird's Head \u2013 Sentani languages|proto\u2013East Bird's Head]] ''*meme'' \"we\" and ''*ba'' \"thou\". However, Saponi shares half its basic lexical vocabulary with Rasawa, and Ross left it in the Lakes Plain family pending further investigation. The Tause language was also previously grouped amongst the Tariku group of Lakes Plain languages.  Ross transferred it to the [[East Bird's Head \u2013 Sentani languages]] on the basis of pronoun similarities in hopes that this would promote further research.\n\nBelow are pronouns in selected Lakes Plain languages as given by Foley (2018):<ref name=\"Foley-NWNG\"/>\n\n:{| {{table}}\n!  !! [[Awera language|Awera]] !! [[Kirikiri language|Kirikiri]] !! [[Iau language|Iau]] !! [[Duvle language|Duvle]] !! [[Obokuitai language|Obokuitai]] !!

While Papuan languages typically have at least two nasal phonemes, this is not the case for Lakes Plain languages. Although phonetic nasals do exist in most Lakes Plain languages, they do not contrast with the corresponding voiced stops. Doutai, Sikaritai, Obokuitai and Foau lack even phonetic nasals. Additionally, no Lakes Plain language has a liquid phoneme. Clouse (1997) reconstructs a typologically remarkable consonant inventory for the ancestor of Lakes Plain, consisting entirely of only five stops:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! \n! labial\n! alveolar\n! velar\n|-align=\"center\"\n! stop\n| *p \n| *t\n| *k\n|-align=\"center\"\n! voiced stop\n| *b\n| *d\n|\n|}\n\nThis results in Lakes Plain languages having high [[functional load]], meaning that there are many words with small distinctions in sounds.\n\n===Vowels===\nMany of the languages have very high constricted (fricativised) vowels; in Doutai and Kirikiri these constitute separate phonemes from /i/ and /u/. The fricativised vowels seem to have developed from deletion of a following consonant.\n\nClouse (1997) reconstructs a five-vowel system for proto-Lakes Plain, not unlike Japanese or Spanish:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!\n! Front\n! Back\n|-align=\"center\"\n! High\n| *i \n| *u\n|-align=\"center\"\n! Mid\n| *e\n| *o\n|-align=\"center\"\n! Low\n| *a\n|\n|}\n\n===Tone===\nLakes Plain languages are all tonal. (The [[Skou languages]] and [[Kainantu-Goroka languages]] are other [[Papuan languages]] possessing contrastive [[tone (linguistics)|tone]].) Clouse and Clouse (1993) reconstruct tone (high level \"H\" and low level \"L\") in proto-Lakes Plain.<ref name=\"Foley-NWNG\"/>\n\n[[Duvle language|Duvle]] and [[Sikaritai language|Sikaritai]] have only two tones, high and low, but all other Lakes Plain languages have more than two tones. All West Tariku languages have both rising and falling tones.<ref name=\"Clouse-LakesPlain\"/>\n\n[[Iau language|Iau]] is the most tonally complex Lakes Plain language. Unlike other Lakes Plain languages which can be disyllabic or trisyllabic, Iau word structure is predominantly monosyllabic. Iau has eight phonemic tones, transcribed by Bateman using numerical [[Chao Tones|Chao tones]] (usually used with East Asian languages): high (44), mid (33), high-rising (45), low-rising (23), high-to-low-falling (42), high-to-mid-falling (43), mid-to-low-falling (32), and falling-rising (423).<ref name=\"Foley-NWNG\"/> Four of the eight Iau tones occur on short vowels, while the remaining four occur on long vowels and often correspond to disyllabic words in other Lakes Plain languages.<ref name=\"Clouse-LakesPlain\"/> (See [[Iau language#Tone]].)\n\n==Morphology==\nUnlike most Papuan languages to the east, words in Lakes Plain languages do not have [[grammatical gender|gender]] or [[inflection]]. [[Bauzi language|Bauzi]], an East Geelvink Bay language spoken to the northwest of the Lakes Plain family, also does not have gender.<ref name=\"Foley-NWNG\">{{cite book |last=Foley |first=William A. |editor1-last=Palmer |editor1-first=Bill |date=2018 |title=The Languages and Linguistics of the New Guinea Area: A Comprehensive Guide |chapter=The languages of Northwest New Guinea |series= The World of Linguistics |volume=4 |location=Berlin |publisher=De Gruyter Mouton |pages=433\u2013568 |isbn=978-3-11-028642-7}}</ref> As analytic isolating languages, there is not much morphology.\n\n==Basic vocabulary==\nBasic vocabulary of the Lakes Plain languages ([[Rasawa language|Rasawa]], [[Kirikiri language|Kirikiri]], [[Iau language|Iau]], [[Duvle language|Duvle]], [[Obokuitai language|Obokuitai]], [[Diebroud language|Diebroud]]) listed in [[William A.

It is a [[rare-earth element]] with a metallic silver luster. Dysprosium is never found in nature as a free element, though it is found in various minerals, such as [[xenotime]]. Naturally occurring dysprosium is composed of seven [[isotope]]s, the most [[isotopic abundance|abundant]] of which is <sup>164</sup>Dy.\n\nDysprosium was first identified in 1886 by [[Paul \u00c9mile Lecoq de Boisbaudran]], but it was not isolated in pure form until the development of [[ion-exchange]] techniques in the 1950s. Dysprosium has relatively few applications where it cannot be replaced by other chemical elements. It is used for its high thermal-neutron absorption cross-section in making [[control rod]]s in [[nuclear reactor]]s, for its high [[magnetic susceptibility]] (<math>\\chi_v \\approx 5.44 \\times 10^{-3}</math>) in data-storage applications, and as a component of [[Terfenol-D]] (a magnetostrictive material).

The metal is obtained as a by-product in the commercial extraction of yttrium. In isolating dysprosium, most of the unwanted metals can be removed magnetically or by a [[flotation process]]. Dysprosium can then be separated from other rare earth metals by an [[ion exchange]] displacement process. The resulting dysprosium ions can then react with either [[fluorine]] or [[chlorine]] to form dysprosium fluoride, DyF<sub>3</sub>, or dysprosium chloride, DyCl<sub>3</sub>. These compounds can be reduced using either calcium or lithium metals in the following reactions:<ref name=heiserman>{{cite book|title = Exploring Chemical Elements and their Compounds|author = Heiserman, David L.|pages = [https://archive.org/details/exploringchemica01heis/page/236 236]\u2013238|publisher = TAB Books|isbn = 978-0-8306-3018-9|year = 1992|url = https://archive.org/details/exploringchemica01heis|url-access = registration}}</ref>\n\n:3 Ca + 2 DyF<sub>3</sub> \u2192 2 Dy + 3 CaF<sub>2</sub>\n:3 Li + DyCl<sub>3</sub> \u2192 Dy + 3 LiCl\n\nThe components are placed in a [[tantalum]] crucible and fired in a [[helium]] atmosphere.

This initiative is being developed in association with dozens of major partners in the science and health communities as well as leading technology companies.\n* Advocacy: The time is now to mobilize and take action to save our planet. Earth Day will amplify direct links between technological innovation and inclusive climate prosperity, two signature themes we will be emphasizing around the world as we build towards the 50th Anniversary of Earth Day in 2020. Earth Day is creating millions of avenues for civic engagement in all 190 countries around the world and working with global decision-makers, including policy makers, local, regional and national governments and corporate sector leaders, to reach a diverse network of citizens around the world.\n* Volunteering: Earth Day is engaging volunteers across the globe for a month-long worldwide volunteer-driven program, \u201cThe Great Global Cleanup\u201d and starting with cleanups for Earth Day 2019. We expect 100 million people participating in public events, as well as one billion others \u2014 including K-12 students around the world \u2014 to remove billions of pieces of trash from our neighborhoods, beaches, and parks.

The first Earth Day [[proclamation]] was issued by [[San Francisco]] Mayor [[Joseph Alioto]] on March 21, 1970. Celebrations were held in various cities, such as San Francisco and in Davis, California with a multi-day street party. UN Secretary-General [[U Thant]] supported McConnell's global initiative to celebrate this annual event; and on February 26, 1971, he signed a proclamation to that effect, saying:\n<blockquote>May there be only peaceful and cheerful Earth Days to come for our beautiful [[Spaceship Earth]] as it continues to spin and circle in frigid space with its warm and fragile cargo of animate life.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.un.org/cyberschoolbus/earthday/peacebell_2004.asp |title=Earth Day 2004 |accessdate=April 15, 2013}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nUnited Nations secretary-general [[Kurt Waldheim]] observed Earth Day with similar ceremonies on the March equinox in 1972, and the United Nations Earth Day ceremony has continued each year since on the day of the March equinox (the United Nations also works with organizers of the April 22 global event). [[Margaret Mead]] added her support for the equinox Earth Day, and in 1978 declared:\n<blockquote>Earth Day is the first holy day which transcends all national borders, yet preserves all geographical integrities, spans mountains and oceans and time belts, and yet brings people all over the world into one resonating accord, is devoted to the preservation of the harmony in nature and yet draws upon the triumphs of technology, the measurement of time, and instantaneous communication through space.<br />\nEarth Day draws on astronomical phenomena in a new way \u2013 which is also the most ancient way \u2013 by using the vernal Equinox, the time when the Sun crosses the equator making the length of night and day equal in all parts of the Earth. To this point in the annual calendar, EARTH DAY attaches no local or divisive set of symbols, no statement of the truth or superiority of one way of life over another. But the selection of the March Equinox makes planetary observance of a shared event possible, and a flag which shows the Earth, as seen from space, appropriate.<ref>Margaret Mead, \"Earth Day,\" EPA Journal, March 1978.</ref></blockquote>\nAt the moment of the equinox, it is traditional to observe Earth Day by ringing the [[Japanese Peace Bell]], which was donated by Japan to the United Nations.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.un.org/pubs/cyberschoolbus/untour/subjap.htm |title=Japanese Peace Bell |publisher=UN.org |accessdate=April 22, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928182232/http://www.un.org/Pubs/CyberSchoolBus/untour/subjap.htm |archivedate=September 28, 2013  }}</ref> Over the years, celebrations have occurred in various places worldwide at the same time as the UN celebration.

The April 22 Earth Day in 2000 combined the big-picture feistiness of the first Earth Day with the international grassroots activism of Earth Day 1990. For 2000, Earth Day had the [[internet]] to help link activists around the world. By the time April 22 came around, 5,000 environmental groups around the world were on board reaching out to hundreds of millions of people in a record 184 countries. Events varied: A [[talking drum]] chain traveled from village to village in [[Gabon]], [[Africa]], for example, while hundreds of thousands of people gathered on the [[National Mall]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], USA.\n\n==Earth Day 2000 to 2019==\nEarth Day 2000 combined the ambitious spirit of the first Earth Day with the international grassroots activism of Earth Day 1990.

It's time to reimagine what we can collectively do for our global environment with activities and events.\n\nThe five components:\n* Citizen Science: Earth Day is leveraging Citizen Science and emerging technologies to engage one million global citizens in the 50th anniversary \u201cEarth Challenge 2020,\u201d collecting one billion data points to measure air quality, water quality, pollution and human health. This initiative is being developed in association with dozens of major partners in the science and health communities as well as leading technology companies.\n* Advocacy: The time is now to mobilize and take action to save our planet. Earth Day will amplify direct links between technological innovation and inclusive climate prosperity, two signature themes we will be emphasizing around the world as we build towards the 50th Anniversary of Earth Day in 2020. Earth Day is creating millions of avenues for civic engagement in all 190 countries around the world and working with global decision-makers, including policy makers, local, regional and national governments and corporate sector leaders, to reach a diverse network of citizens around the world.\n* Volunteering: Earth Day is engaging volunteers across the globe for a month-long worldwide volunteer-driven program, \u201cThe Great Global Cleanup\u201d and starting with cleanups for Earth Day 2019. We expect 100 million people participating in public events, as well as one billion others \u2014 including K-12 students around the world \u2014 to remove billions of pieces of trash from our neighborhoods, beaches, and parks. EDN is also working with partners to plant 7.8 billion trees, one for every human who will live on the planet in 2020.

EDN will continue to work with teachers, students, innovators and thought leaders to educate and activate a new generation of environmental leaders around the world. \n* Events: Earth Day is now recognized worldwide as the planet's most significant civic engagement event each year. The 50th anniversary of Earth Day will be marked by tens of thousands of rallies and community events in every country in the world, and large-scale signature events to take place in Washington, D.C., and other global capitals.\n* Artists for the Earth: As Earth Day reaches its milestone 50th Anniversary in April 2020, nature and the environment are faced with enormous challenges from loss of biodiversity, pollution, degradation of our ecosystems, and climate change.

An [[equinox]] in astronomy is that point in time (not a whole day) when the Sun is directly above the Earth's equator, occurring around March 20 and September 23 each year. In most cultures, the [[equinox]]es and [[solstice]]s are considered to start or separate the [[season]]s.\n\n[[John McConnell (peace activist)|John McConnell]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.earthsite.org |title=EarthSite |accessdate=April 22, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060422193041/http://www.earthsite.org/ |archive-date=April 22, 2006 |url-status=dead }}</ref> first introduced the idea of a global holiday called \"Earth Day\" at the 1969 [[UNESCO]] Conference on the Environment. The first Earth Day [[proclamation]] was issued by [[San Francisco]] Mayor [[Joseph Alioto]] on March 21, 1970. Celebrations were held in various cities, such as San Francisco and in Davis, California with a multi-day street party. UN Secretary-General [[U Thant]] supported McConnell's global initiative to celebrate this annual event; and on February 26, 1971, he signed a proclamation to that effect, saying:\n<blockquote>May there be only peaceful and cheerful Earth Days to come for our beautiful [[Spaceship Earth]] as it continues to spin and circle in frigid space with its warm and fragile cargo of animate life.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.un.org/cyberschoolbus/earthday/peacebell_2004.asp |title=Earth Day 2004 |accessdate=April 15, 2013}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nUnited Nations secretary-general [[Kurt Waldheim]] observed Earth Day with similar ceremonies on the March equinox in 1972, and the United Nations Earth Day ceremony has continued each year since on the day of the March equinox (the United Nations also works with organizers of the April 22 global event). [[Margaret Mead]] added her support for the equinox Earth Day, and in 1978 declared:\n<blockquote>Earth Day is the first holy day which transcends all national borders, yet preserves all geographical integrities, spans mountains and oceans and time belts, and yet brings people all over the world into one resonating accord, is devoted to the preservation of the harmony in nature and yet draws upon the triumphs of technology, the measurement of time, and instantaneous communication through space.<br />\nEarth Day draws on astronomical phenomena in a new way \u2013 which is also the most ancient way \u2013 by using the vernal Equinox, the time when the Sun crosses the equator making the length of night and day equal in all parts of the Earth. To this point in the annual calendar, EARTH DAY attaches no local or divisive set of symbols, no statement of the truth or superiority of one way of life over another. But the selection of the March Equinox makes planetary observance of a shared event possible, and a flag which shows the Earth, as seen from space, appropriate.<ref>Margaret Mead, \"Earth Day,\" EPA Journal, March 1978.</ref></blockquote>\nAt the moment of the equinox, it is traditional to observe Earth Day by ringing the [[Japanese Peace Bell]], which was donated by Japan to the United Nations.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.un.org/pubs/cyberschoolbus/untour/subjap.htm |title=Japanese Peace Bell |publisher=UN.org |accessdate=April 22, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928182232/http://www.un.org/Pubs/CyberSchoolBus/untour/subjap.htm |archivedate=September 28, 2013  }}</ref> Over the years, celebrations have occurred in various places worldwide at the same time as the UN celebration.

[[Sebastian Moran]] after the death of [[Professor Moriarty]] at the [[Reichenbach Falls]] in the [[Sherlock Holmes]] story \"[[The Final Problem]]\". But in a second season episode, guest star [[Jessie Royce Landis]] plays a character who claims that she founded THRUSH.\n\nTHRUSH's aim was to conquer the world. <!--Napoleon Solo said, in \"The Green Opal Affair\", \"THRUSH believes in the two-party system \u2013 the masters and the slaves\", and in the pilot episode (\"The Vulcan Affair\"), that THRUSH \"kills people the way people kill flies \u2013 a reflex action \u2013 a flick of the wrist.\"--> THRUSH was considered so dangerous an organization that even governments who were ideologically opposed to each other \u2013 such as the United States and the [[Soviet Union]] \u2013 had cooperated in forming and operating the U.N.C.L.E. organization. Similarly, when Solo and Kuryakin held opposing political views, the friction between them in the story was held to a minimum. Although executive producer [[Norman Felton]] and Ian Fleming conceived Napoleon Solo, it was the producer [[Sam Rolfe]] who created the global U.N.C.L.E. hierarchy, and he included the Soviet agent, Illya Kuryakin. Unlike the CIA or [[Secret Intelligence Service|MI6]], U.N.C.L.E. was a global organization of agents from many countries and cultures.\n\n===Innocent character=== <!-- if THRUSH wants to subjugate humanity, humanity deserves a vote/delegate/representative -->\nThe creators decided an innocent character would be featured in each episode, giving the audience someone with whom to identify.<ref name=\"manfromuncle.org\"/> Despite many changes over four seasons, \"innocents\" remained a constant \u2013 from a suburban housewife in the pilot, \"The Vulcan Affair\" (film version: ''To Trap a Spy''), to those kidnapped in the final episode, \"The Seven Wonders of the World Affair.\"\n\n==Episodes==\n{{Main article|List of The Man from U.N.C.L.E. episodes}}\n\n===''Solo'' \u2013 the pilot===\n{{refimprove section|date=November 2014}}\nFilmed in color from late November to early December 1963, with locations at a [[Lever Brothers]] soap factory in California, the television pilot made as a 70-minute film was originally titled ''Ian Fleming's Solo'' and later shortened to ''Solo''. However, in February 1964 a law firm representing ''[[James Bond in film|James Bond]]'' movie producers [[Harry Saltzman]] and [[Albert R. Broccoli]] demanded an end to the use of Fleming's name in connection with the series and an end to use of the name and character \"Solo\", \"Napoleon Solo\" and \"Mr. Solo\". At that time filming was underway for the ''Bond'' movie ''[[Goldfinger (film)|Goldfinger]]'', in which [[Martin Benson (actor)|Martin Benson]] was playing a supporting character named \"Mr. Solo\", being an [[American Mafia]] boss murdered by [[Auric Goldfinger|the main villain]]. The claim was the name \"Solo\" had been sold to them by Fleming, and Fleming could not again use it. Within five days Fleming had signed an [[affidavit]] that nothing in the Solo pilot infringed any of his Bond characters, but the threat of legal action resulted in a settlement in which the name Napoleon Solo could be kept but the title of the show had to change.\n\nThe role of the head of U.N.C.L.E. in the pilot was Mr. Allison, played by [[Will Kuluva]], rather than Mr. Waverly, played by Leo G. Carroll, and David McCallum's Illya Kuryakin only had a brief role. Revisions to some scenes were shot for television, including those needed to feature Leo G. Carroll. The pilot episode was reedited to 50 minutes to fit a one-hour time slot, converted to black and white, and shown on television as \"The Vulcan Affair\".\n\nNBC in New York was not happy with the pilot. An executive wanted to drop the Russian character, Illya Kuryakin, from the cast, but he could not remember his name, saying \"K\u2013 K\u2013\". Felton replied \"Kuluva?\" and the executive replied \"That's it.\" Felton did not argue as he wanted to replace Kuluva anyway. When later asked who the replacement was, Felton replied, \"Leo G. Carroll\". The executive said that he was too old to replace David McCallum as Solo's sidekick. Felton explained he had replaced Kuluva, and that it was too late to get rid of McCallum, the contracts already having been signed. It has been rumored for years that the executive in question was [[Grant Tinker]], then the husband of [[Mary Tyler Moore]] and later chairman of NBC.\n\nAdditional color sequences with [[Luciana Paluzzi]] were shot in April 1964, and then added to the pilot for MGM to release it outside the United States as a [[B movie]] titled ''[[To Trap a Spy]]''.<ref name=\"Heitland\"/>{{Page needed|date=April 2017}} This premiered in [[Hong Kong]] in November 1964. The extra scenes were reedited to tone down their sexuality, and then used in the regular series in the episode \"The Four-Steps Affair\".\n\nBeyond extra scenes for the feature film, and revised scene shots and edits made for the television episode, there are other differences among the three versions of the story. Before the show went into full production there was concern from [[MGM]] that the name of THRUSH for the pilot's international criminal organization sounded too much like [[SMERSH]], the international spy-killing organization in Fleming's Bond series. The studio suggested Raven, Shark, Squid, Vulture, Tarantula, Snipe, Sphinx, Dooom{{sic}}, and Maggot (the last used in early scripts). Although no legal action took place, the name was dubbed as \"WASP\" in the feature version ''To Trap a Spy''. The original pilot kept THRUSH (presumably since it was not intended to be released to the public in that version). Felton and Rolfe pushed for the reinstatement of \"THRUSH\". It turned out that WASP could not be used, since [[Gerry Anderson]]'s British television series ''[[Stingray (1964 TV series)|Stingray]]'' was based on an organization called W.A.S.P. (World Aquanaut Security Patrol). By May 1964, THRUSH was retained for the television episode edit of the pilot. Despite this, WASP was used by the feature film in Japan in late 1964, and it was left in the American release in 1966. \n\nAnother change among the three versions of the pilot story was the cover name for the character of Elaine May Donaldson. In the original pilot it was Elaine Van Nessen; in the television version and the feature version it was Elaine Van Every. Illya Kuryakin's badge number is 17 in the pilot, rather than 2 during the series, and Solo's hair, after new footage was added, changed back and forth from a slicked back style to the less severe style he wore throughout the series.\n\nWith the popularity of the show and the spy craze, ''To Trap a Spy'' and the second U.N.C.L.E. feature ''[[The Spy with My Face]]'' were released in the United States as an MGM [[double feature]] in early 1966.\n\n===Season 1===\n[[File:Kurt Russell Robert Vaughn Man From UNCLE 1964.JPG|thumb|180px|Vaughn and a young [[Kurt Russell]] in \"The Finny Foot Affair\"]]\nThe show's first season was in [[Black-and-White|black and white]]. Rolfe created a kind of [[Alice in Wonderland|''Alice's Adventures In Wonderland'']] world, where mundane everyday life would intersect with the looking-glass fantasy of international espionage which lay just beyond. The U.N.C.L.E. universe was one where the weekly \"innocent\" would get caught up in a series of fantastic adventures, in a battle of good and evil.<ref name=\"manfromuncle.org\"/>\n\nU.N.C.L.E. headquarters in New York City was most-frequently entered by a [[secret passage|secret entrance]] in Del Floria's Tailor Shop. Another entrance was through The Masque Club. Mr. Waverly had his own secret entrance, hinted at in the episode \"The Mad, Mad Tea Party Affair.\" The episodes were largely filmed on the MGM back lot.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.manfromuncle.org/kcretro7.htm |title=U.N.C.L.E. - Background And History - Retrospective - The U.N.C.L.E. Sets |publisher=Manfromuncle.org |date= |accessdate=2011-03-05}}</ref> The same building with an imposing exterior staircase was used for episodes set throughout the Mediterranean area and Latin America, and the same dirt road lined with [[eucalyptus]] trees on the back lot in Culver City stood in for virtually every continent of the globe. The episodes followed a naming convention where each title was in the form of \"The ***** Affair\", such as \"The Vulcan Affair\", \"The Mad, Mad, Tea Party Affair\", and \"The Waverly Ring Affair\", etc.  The only exception was \"Alexander the Greater Affair\". The first season episode \"The Green Opal Affair\" establishes that U.N.C.L.E. uses the term \"affair\" to refer to its different missions.\n\nRolfe endeavored to make the implausible elements in the series seem not only feasible but entertaining.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} In the series, frogmen emerge from wells in [[Iowa]], shootouts occur between U.N.C.L.E. and THRUSH agents in a crowded [[Manhattan]] movie theater, and top-secret organizations are hidden behind innocuous [[brownstone]] facades. The series began to dabble in [[Spy-fi (neologism)|science-fiction plots]], beginning with \"The Double Affair\" in which a THRUSH agent, made to look like Solo through plastic surgery, infiltrates a secret U.N.C.L.E. facility where an immensely powerful weapon called \"Project Earthsave\" is stored; according to the dialogue, the weapon was developed to protect against a potential alien threat to Earth. ''[[The Spy with My Face]]'' was the theatrical film version of this episode.\n\nIn its first season ''The Man from U.N.C.L.E.'' competed against ''[[The Red Skelton Show]]'' on [[CBS]] and [[Walter Brennan]]'s short-lived ''[[The Tycoon (TV series)|The Tycoon]]'' on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]. During this time producer Norman Felton told [[Alan Caillou]] and several of the series writers to make the show more [[tongue in cheek]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Weaver|first1=Tom|title=Science Fiction and Fantasy Film Flashbacks: Conversations with 24 Actors, Writers, Producers and Directors from the Golden Age|date=2005|publisher=McFarland Press|location=Jefferson, North Carolina|isbn=0786420707|page=52}}</ref>\n\n===Seasons 2\u20134===\n[[File:David McCallum Man From UNCLE 1965.JPG|left|thumb|160px|David McCallum as Illya Kuryakin]]\nSwitching to [[color]], ''U.N.C.L.E.'' continued to enjoy huge popularity. When Rolfe left the show at the conclusion of the first season, David Victor became the new [[showrunner]]. Over the next three seasons, five different showrunners would supervise the ''U.N.C.L.E.'' franchise, and each one took the show in a direction that differed considerably from that of the first season. In an attempt to emulate the success of [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s mid-season hit ''[[Batman (TV series)|Batman]]'', which had proved hugely popular with its debut in early 1966, ''U.N.C.L.E.'' moved swiftly towards self-parody and slapstick.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> In contrast to other seasons, the fourth and final season had a recurring female character, Lisa Rogers, played by Barbara Moore in ten episodes.<ref>Barbara Moore, imdb biography, https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0600923/?ref_=tt_cl_t10</ref>\n\nDuring the third season the producers made a conscious decision to increase the level of humor.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> This new direction resulted in a severe [[Nielsen ratings|ratings]] drop, and nearly resulted in the show's cancellation. It was renewed for a fourth season and an attempt was made to go back to serious storytelling, but the ratings never recovered and ''U.N.C.L.E.'' was cancelled midway through the season.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n==Spin-off: ''The Girl from U.N.C.L.E.''==\n{{unreferenced section|date=September 2016}}\nThe series was popular enough to generate a spin-off series, ''[[The Girl from U.N.C.L.E.]]'' (1966\u201367) The \"girl\" was first introduced during ''The Man From U.N.C.L.E.'' episode \"[[The Moonglow Affair]]\" (February&nbsp;25, 1966) and was then played by [[Mary Ann Mobley]]. The spin-off series ran for one season, starring [[Stefanie Powers]] as agent \"April Dancer\", a character name credited to Ian Fleming, and Noel Harrison as agent Mark Slate (who had been played substantially differently by actor [[Norman Fell]] in the pilot). There was some crossover between the two shows, and [[Leo G. Carroll]] played Mr. Waverly in both programs, becoming the second actor in American television to star as the same character in two separate series.\n\n===Reunion TV movie===\n{{main article|Return of the Man from U.N.C.L.E.}}\n{{unreferenced section|date=September 2017}}\nA reunion [[telefilm]], ''Return of the Man from U.N.C.L.E.'' subtitled ''The Fifteen Years Later Affair,'' was broadcast on [[CBS]] in America on April&nbsp;5, 1983, with Vaughn and McCallum reprising their roles, and [[Patrick Macnee]] replacing [[Leo G. Carroll]], who had died in 1972, as the head of U.N.C.L.E. A framed picture of Carroll appeared on his desk. The movie included a tribute to Ian Fleming via a cameo appearance by an unidentified secret agent with the initials \"JB\". The part was played by [[George Lazenby]] who was shown driving James Bond's trademark vehicle, an [[Aston Martin DB5]]. One character, identifying him, says that it is \"just like ''[[On Her Majesty's Secret Service (film)|On Her Majesty's Secret Service]]''\", which was Lazenby's only Bond film.\n\nThe movie, written by Michael Sloan and directed by [[Ray Austin (director)|Ray Austin]], briefly filled in the missing years. THRUSH had been put out of business, and the escape of its leader from prison begins the story. Solo and Kuryakin, who had retired, are recalled by U.N.C.L.E. to recapture the escapee and defeat THRUSH once and for all. Rather than reuniting the agents and recapturing their chemistry, however, the agents are separated and paired with younger agents. Like most similar reunion films, this production was considered a trial balloon for a possible new series which never materialized.\n\nAlthough some personnel from the original series were involved (like composer [[Gerald Fried]] and director of photography Fred Koenekamp), the movie was not produced by MGM but by Michael Sloan Productions in association with [[Viacom Productions]].\n\n==Theme music==\n{{refimprove|date=September 2017}}\nThe theme music, written by [[Jerry Goldsmith]], changed slightly each season.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.manfromuncle.org/sound.htm |title=U.N.C.L.E. - The Soundtrack |publisher=Manfromuncle.org |date= |accessdate=2011-03-05}}</ref> Goldsmith provided only three original scores and was succeeded by [[Morton Stevens]], who composed four scores for the series. After Stevens, [[Walter Scharf]] did six scores, and [[Lalo Schifrin]] did two. [[Gerald Fried]] was composer from season two through the beginning of season four. The final composers were [[Robert Drasnin]] (who also scored episodes of ''[[Mission: Impossible (1966 TV series)|Mission: Impossible]]'', as did Schifrin, Scharf, and Fried), [[Nelson Riddle]] (whose score for the two-part episode \"The Concrete Overcoat Affair\" was so loathed by Norman Felton that he never hired the composer again, although the music did get tracked into other third-season episodes), and Richard Shores.\n\nThe music reflected the show's changing seasons. Goldsmith, Stevens, and Scharf composed dramatic scores in the first season using brass, unusual time signatures and martial rhythms. Gerald Fried and Robert Drasnin opted for a lighter approach in the second, employing harpsichords and bongos. By the third season, the music, like the show, had become more camp, exemplified by an R&B organ and saxophone version of the theme. The fourth season's attempt at seriousness was duly echoed by Richard Shores' somber scores.\n\n==Guest stars and other actors==\n[[File:Jan Murray Patsy Kelly Pat Harrington Man From UNCLE.JPG|thumb|right|[[Jan Murray]], [[Patsy Kelly]], and [[Pat Harrington Jr.]] in \"The Hula Doll Affair\" (1967) ]]\nApart from Solo, Kuryakin and Waverly, very few recurring characters appeared on the show with any regularity.

Internally designated the \"U.N.C.L.E. Special\", it was a modular [[Semiautomatic firearm|semiautomatic]] weapon. The basic [[pistol]] could be converted into a longer-range [[carbine]] by attaching a long barrel, an extendable shoulder stock, a telescopic sight, and an extended [[magazine (firearm)|magazine]]. In this \"carbine mode\", the pistol could fire on full automatic. This capability brought authorities to the set to investigate reports that the studio was illegally manufacturing [[machine guns]]. They threatened to confiscate the prop guns and it took a tour of the prop room to convince them that these were actually \"dummy\" pistols incapable of firing live ammunition. The actual pistol used as the prop was the [[Mauser#Mauser Model 1934 pocket pistol|Mauser Model 1934 Pocket Pistol]], but it was unreliable, it jammed constantly, and it was dwarfed by the carbine accessories. It was soon replaced by the larger and more-reliable [[Walther P38]].\n\nThe long magazine was actually a standard magazine with a dummy extension, but it inspired several small-arms manufacturers to begin making long magazines for various pistols. While many of these continue to be available 40 years later, long magazines were not available for the P38 for some years.{{clarify|date=April 2012|reason=which years? Not for some years then, in the 60s, or not for some years 40 years afterwards?}}\n\nTHRUSH had a range of weaponry of its own, much of them only in the development stage before being destroyed by the heroes. A notable item was the [[infrared]] [[sniperscope]], enabling villains to aim gunfire in total darkness. The prop was built from a U.S. Army-surplus [[M1 carbine]], with a vertical foregrip and barrel compensator, and using army-surplus infrared scopes. The infrared [[Special effects|special effect]] was achieved using a searchlight to illuminate the target. The fully equipped carbines were seen only once, in \"The Iowa Scuba Affair\". After that, a mockup of the scope was used to make handling easier.\n\nGerman small arms were well represented in the series. Not only were P38s frequently seen (both as the U.N.C.L.E. Special and in standard configuration), but also the [[Luger P-08]] pistol. In the pilot episode \"The Vulcan Affair\", Illya Kuryakin is carrying a [[M1911 pistol|standard U.S. Army .45 caliber pistol]]. The [[Mauser C96|\"Broomhandle\" Mauser carbines]] and [[MP 40]] machine pistols were favored by opponents. U.N.C.L.E. also used the MP 40. Beginning in the third season, both U.N.C.L.E and THRUSH agents used rifles that were either the Spanish [[CETME]] or the [[Heckler & Koch G3]] (based on the CETME).\n\n==Awards and nominations==\n{{unreferenced section|date=September 2017}}\n[[Emmy Awards]]\n*1965: Outstanding Individual Achievements in Entertainment \u2013 Actors and Performers (nominated) \u2013 David McCallum<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.emmys.com/awards/nominees-winners/1965|title=1965 Nominees/Winners|last=|first=|date=|work=Television Academy|access-date=2017-10-04|language=en}}</ref>\n*1965: Outstanding Program Achievements in Entertainment (nominated) \u2013 Sam Rolfe<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.emmys.com/awards/nominees-winners/1965?page=1|title=Nominees/Winners|work=Television Academy|access-date=2017-10-04|language=en}}</ref>\n*1966: Outstanding Continued Performance by an Actor in a Leading Role in a Dramatic Series (nominated) \u2013 David McCallum<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.emmys.com/awards/nominees-winners/1966|title=Nominees/Winners|work=Television Academy|access-date=2017-10-04|language=en}}</ref>\n*1966: Outstanding Dramatic Series (nominated) \u2013 Norman Felton<ref name=\"auto\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.emmys.com/awards/nominees-winners/1966?page=1|title=Nominees/Winners|work=Television Academy|access-date=2017-10-04|language=en}}</ref>\n*1966: Outstanding Performance by an Actor in a Supporting Role in a Drama (nominated) \u2013 Leo G.

The episodes with the extra footage that made it to theaters were the original pilot, \"The Vulcan Affair\", retitled ''[[To Trap a Spy]]'' and \"The Double Affair\" retitled as ''[[The Spy with My Face]]''. Both had added sex and violence, new sub-plots and guest stars not in the original TV episodes. They were released in early 1966 as an ''U.N.C.L.E.'' double-feature program first run in neighborhood theaters, bypassing the customary downtown movie palaces which were still thriving in the mid-1960s and where new movies usually played for weeks or months before coming to outlying screens.\n\nA selling point to seeing these films theatrically was that they were being shown in color, at a time when most people had only black and white TVs (and indeed the two first-season episodes that were expanded to feature length, while filmed in color, had only been broadcast in black and white). The words \"in color\" featured prominently on the trailers, TV spots, and posters for the film releases. The episodes used to make U.N.C.L.E. films were not included in the packages of television episodes screened outside the United States.<ref name=\"Heitland\"/>{{Page needed|date=April 2017}}\n\nSubsequent two-part episodes, beginning with the second season premiere, \"Alexander The Greater Affair\", retitled ''One Spy Too Many'' for its theatrical release, were developed into one complete feature film with only occasional extra sexy and violent footage added to them, sometimes as just inserts. In the case of ''One Spy Too Many,'' a subplot featuring [[Yvonne Craig]] as an U.N.C.L.E. operative carrying on a flirtatious relationship with Solo was also added to the film; Craig does not appear in the television episodes.\n\nThe later films were not released in America, only overseas, but the first few did well in American theaters and remain one of the rare examples of a television show released in paid theatrical engagements. With the exception of the two-part episode \"The Five Daughters Affair\", shown as part of [[Granada Plus]]'s run of the series, the episodes which became movies have never aired on British television.\n\nThe films in the series:\n* ''[[To Trap a Spy]]'' (1964)\n* ''[[The Spy with My Face]]'' (1965)\n* ''[[One Spy Too Many]]'' (1966)\n* ''[[One of Our Spies Is Missing]]'' (1966)\n* ''[[The Spy in the Green Hat]]'' (1966)\n* ''[[The Karate Killers]]'' (1967)\n* ''[[The Helicopter Spies]]'' (1968)\n* ''[[How to Steal the World]]'' (1968)\n\n===2015 remake===\n{{main article|The Man from U.N.C.L.E.

In the US, there was a [[Gold Key Comics]] series which ran for twenty-two issues. Entertainment Publishing released an eleven-issue series of one- and two-part stories from January 1987 to September 1988 that updated U.N.C.L.E. to the 1980s, while largely ignoring the reunion TV-movie. A two-part comics story, \"The Birds of Prey Affair\", was put out by [[Millennium Publications]] in 1993, which showcased the return of a smaller, more-streamlined version of THRUSH, controlled by Dr. Egret, who had melded with the Ultimate Computer. The script was written by [[Mark Ellis (American author)|Mark Ellis]] and Terry Collins, with artwork by Nick Choles, and transplanted the characters into the 1990s.\n\nTwo ''Man from U.N.C.L.E.'' strips were originated for the British market in the 1960s (some Gold Key material was also reprinted), the most notable for ''Lady Penelope'' comic, which launched in January 1966. This was replaced by a ''Girl from U.N.C.L.E.'' strip in January 1967. ''Man from U.N.C.L.E.'' also featured in the short-lived title ''Solo'' (published between February and September 1967) and some text stories appeared in ''TV Tornado''.\n\nIn 2015\u20132016, [[DC Comics]] launched ''Batman '66 Meets the Man from U.N.C.L.E.'', a crossover with its ''[[Batman '66]]'' series.\n\n===Merchandise===\nLicensed merchandise included a ''Man from U.N.C.L.E.'' [[digest size|digest-sized]] story magazine, [[board game]]s, Gilbert action figures, [[Aurora Plastics Corporation|Aurora]] plastic model kits, lunch boxes, and [[toy gun]]s.<ref>Paquette, Brian & Howley, Paul ''The Toys From U.N.C.L.E.: Memorabilia and Collectors Guide'' Entertainment Publishing; First edition. (January 1, 1990)</ref>\n\nAn example of this, the Louis Marx \"Target Gun Set\", a dart-gun shooting-game released in the form of a quasi-playset, is built around the setting of U.N.C.L.E. headquarters in New York City. Art on the cardboard stand displays both the U.N.C.L.E. and THRUSH logos, and a half-dozen soft plastic figures per \"side\" were provided, including Solo, Kuryakin and Waverly. The game measures {{convert|57|x|18|in|cm}}; the figures, at {{convert|6|in|cm}}, represent one of the few attempts Marx made at supplementing its 6-inch figure line. The U.N.C.L.E. figures are cast in blue, except for a single (unnamed) figure in tan; THRUSH agents are cast in gray. Marx was released an arcade game licensed under ''The Man from U.N.C.L.E.''<ref>{{cite journal|title=Open Channel 'D' with the Marx U.N.C.L.E.

Pictured: [[Robert Vaughn]].]]\nTwo dozen novels were based upon ''Man from U.N.C.L.E.'' and published between 1965 and 1968. Unhampered by television censors, the novels were generally grittier and more violent than the televised episodes. The series sold in the millions, and was the largest TV-novel tie-in franchise until surpassed by ''[[Dark Shadows]]'' and ''[[List of Star Trek novels|Star Trek]]''.\n# ''The Man from U.N.C.L.E.'' ({{a.k.a.}} ''The Thousand Coffins Affair'') by [[Michael Avallone]]. When villages in Africa and Scotland are wiped out by a plague of madness, Solo and Kuryakin dig up a graveyard and a monster named Golgotha.\n# ''The Doomsday Affair'' by [[Harry Whittington (writer)|Harry Whittington]].

DAGGER fanatics have an energy damper that can shut down electrical fields, atomic reactions, and human beings, and even THRUSH is panicked. This is the novel in which McDaniel introduced the acronym for THRUSH, though it was never used by any other of the novelists nor on the show itself.\n# ''The Mad Scientist Affair'' by [[John T. Phillifent]]. The agents stop biochemist \"King Mike\" from poisoning London, then discover his second plan is to contaminate the entire North Sea.\n# ''The Vampire Affair'' by David McDaniel. Napoleon and Illya don't believe in vampires and werewolves, but an U.N.C.L.E. agent has died, so they must investigate an ancient castle in Transylvanian Romania.\n# ''The Radioactive Camel Affair'' by Peter Leslie. Solo joins a caravan and Kuryakin threads a war zone to reach a missile base deep in the Sudan hinterlands.\n# ''The Monster Wheel Affair'' by David McDaniel. The agents canvass the globe and infiltrate a remote island to confirm an inexplicable space station belongs to Egypt.\n# ''The Diving Dames Affair'' by Peter Leslie. The deaths of two merry missionaries lead the agents to the plains of Brazil and a giant dam with no apparent purpose.\n# ''The Assassination Affair'' by [[J. Hunter Holly]]. Surviving assassins' bullets and a \"do-it-yourself murder room\", the agents follow THRUSH to desolated Michigan farms and a scheme to starve the world.\n# ''The Invisibility Affair'' by Thomas Stratton ([[Buck Coulson]] and [[Gene DeWeese]]). The agents track an invisible dirigible to a submarine in Lake Michigan \u2013 and a plot to hijack an entire country.\n# ''The Mind Twisters Affair'' by Thomas Stratton. People in a college town are unaccountably catatonic, euphoric, and raging. The agents must ferret out who and how before the \"experiment\" goes nationwide.\n# ''The Rainbow Affair'' by David McDaniel. The agents consult every classic fictional spy and detective in England to find the world's best bank robber before THRUSH can recruit or kill him.\n# ''The Cross of Gold Affair'' by Fredric Davies (Ron Ellik and Fredric Langley). Clues hidden in crossword puzzles lead the agents, hippies, and frogmen to a Coney Island death-trap to stop the biggest heist in history.\n# ''The Utopia Affair'' by David McDaniel. Solo must command U.N.C.L.E. North America while Waverly is on a forced six-week vacation, and an undercover Illya tries to protect Waverly from THRUSH assassins.\n# ''The Splintered Sunglasses Affair'' by Peter Leslie\n# ''The Hollow Crown Affair'' by David McDaniel. In the last published David McDaniel's novel, THRUSH Agent Ward and Irene Baldwin from ''The Dagger Affair'' return in a battle against an U.N.C.L.E. lab chief who has defected to THRUSH.\n# ''The Unfair Fare Affair'' by Peter Leslie\n# ''The Power Cube Affair'' by John T. Phillifent\n# ''The Corfu Affair'' by John T. Phillifent\n# ''The Thinking Machine Affair'' by Joel Bernard\n# ''The Stone Cold Dead in the Market Affair'' by John Oram\n# ''The Finger in the Sky Affair'' by Peter Leslie\n# ''The Final Affair'' by David McDaniel. Completed but never published, the manuscript has been circulated by fans.\n\nVolumes 10\u201315 and 17 of the series were only published in the United States.\n\n''The Rainbow Affair'' is notable for unnamed cameos by [[Simon Templar|The Saint]], [[Miss Marple]], [[John Steed]], [[Emma Peel]], [[Willie Garvin]], [[Tommy Hambledon]], [[Neddie Seagoon]], [[Father Brown]], a retired [[Sherlock Holmes]] (aged nearly 100), and [[Dr. Fu Manchu]].\n\n[[Whitman Publishing|Whitman Books]] published three hardcover novels aimed at young readers: ''The Affair of the Gunrunners' Gold'' and ''The Affair of the Gentle Saboteur'' by [[Brandon Keith (Writer)|Brandon Keith]], and ''The Calcutta Affair'' by George S. Elrick. The first two broke the \"...Affair\" naming convention used by the franchise on most other TV episodes and book releases.\n[[Image:ManFromUNCLEbook.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Rare children's storybook based upon ''The Man from U.N.C.L.E.''

Published under the house name \"Robert Hart Davis\", they were written by such authors as John Jakes, Dennis Lynds, and Bill Pronzini. 24 issues, which also offered original crime and spy-fiction short stories and novelettes, and occasional SF and fantasy reprints under the title \"Department of Lost Stories\", ran monthly from February 1966 to January 1968. An additional novella entitled \"The Vanishing City Affair\" was advertised on page 140 of the January 1968 issue for the proposed (but never published) February 1968 issue. It is as yet unconfirmed, however, if this novella was shelved for possible future release elsewhere or if it was ever written at all.\n\nThree science-fiction novels appear to be rewrites of \"orphaned\" U.N.C.L.E. novel outlines or manuscripts: ''Genius Unlimited'' by John Rackham (a pseudonym of Phillifent), ''The Arsenal Out of Time'' by McDaniel, and ''Agent Of T.E.R.R.A. #1: The Flying Saucer Gambit'' by Jack Jardine (writing as Larry Maddock).\n\n===TV Annuals===\nThere have been four TV Annuals published in UK between 1967 and 1970 by World Distributors which features written stories and reprint of a Gold Key story which were never published in the UK.\n\n==Home media==\nIn November 2007, after coming to an agreement with [[Warner Home Video]], [[Time-Life]] released a 41&nbsp;DVD set (region&nbsp;1) for direct order, with sales through stores scheduled for fall 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/newsitem.cfm?NewsID=7563|title=The Man from U.N.C.L.E.

References in other television shows have continued over the years, including a 2010 episode of ''[[Mad Men]]'' called \"The Chrysanthemum and the Sword\". It has also been referenced in other television shows including ''[[Get Smart]],'' ''[[Angry Beavers]],'' and ''[[Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In|Laugh-In]].''\n\nThe TV show ''[[My Favorite Martian]]'' (1963\u20131966) also used CRUSH as the name of the evil spy organization, spoofing THRUSH in two episodes. In the season two episode \"006 3/4\", Tim finds a distress note from Agent 006 of Top Secret, who is being tracked by CRUSH. Top Secret asks Tim to assist Agent 004, to save 006. In the season three episode \"Butterball\" Uncle Martin must rescue Tim who is kidnapped by Butterball.\n\nA 1966 episode of ''[[The Avengers (TV series)|The Avengers]]'' was titled \"[[The Girl from AUNTIE]]\".\n\nIn a 1966 episode of the sitcom ''[[Please Don't Eat the Daisies (TV series)|Please Don't Eat the Daisies]]'' titled \"Say UNCLE\", the young twins are fans of ''The Man From U.N.C.L.E.'' and become convinced that their father Jim is a secret agent. In one scene, they watch Jim emerge from a tailor shop similar to Del Florio's. Another man entering the shop asks Jim for a match, and Jim gives him his matchbook. The boys are astonished, because the other man is David McCallum, identified in the ending credits as Illya Kuryakin; they believe their father has just passed a secret message to the \"real-life\" Illya Kuryakin. The scene ends with the ''U.N.C.L.E'' scene transition: the action freezes and goes out of focus.<ref>{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XD5vtf-x9TE|title=ILLYA KURYAKIN on PDETD|date=15 October 2007|work=YouTube}}</ref>\n\nIt was also referenced in [[Glad (company)|Glad]] commercials in the late 1960s and early 1970s, which starred the \"Man from GLAD\", a trenchcoat-wearing agent who flew around in his combination boat/helicopter demonstrating Glad products to suburban housewives and saving the day.\n\nIn 1970, a \"secret agent\" theme was used by Australian confectionery manufacturer [[Allen's (confectionery)|Allen's]] to market their Anticol cough lozenges, with TV commercials running under the title \"The Man From A.N.T.I.C.O.L.\", featuring agent \"Napoleon Brandy\" combatting illnesses being spread by the agents of S.L.A.S.H.<ref>{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=en_zH3lxEig|title=Allen's Anticol - TV commercial (1970)|date=6 March 2009|work=YouTube}}</ref><ref>{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_48RBPkta0|title=Allen's Anticol - TV commercial (1970)|date=6 August 2016|work=YouTube}}</ref>\n\nIn a late 1986 episode of ''[[The A-Team]],'' [[Robert Vaughn]] \u2013 who had been added to the show's cast as mysterious retired agent for the show's final season, as part of an effort to revive flagging ratings \u2013 was reunited with guest star David McCallum, in an episode entitled \"The 'Say U.N.C.L.E.' Affair\". This story paid homage to ''The Man from U.N.C.L.E.,'' complete with chapter titles, the word \"affair\" in the title, the phrase \"Open Channel D\", similar scene transitions, and much mention of Vaughn's and McCallum's respective characters having once worked closely together as agents.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.legendarytv.com/the_a-team/the_a-team_robert_vaughn.asp |title=The A-Team, Robert Vaughn, General Stockwell |publisher=Legendarytv.com |date=1932-11-22 |accessdate=2011-03-05}}</ref> But in this story, McCallum's agent had turned villainous, selling out to the enemy and now capturing Vaughn to try to find out the whereabouts of a Soviet jet fighter.\n\nBeginning in 2003, McCallum starred in the CBS television series ''[[NCIS (TV series)|NCIS]]'' as Dr. Donald \"Ducky\" Mallard, M.D., a medical examiner. During the episode \"The Meat Puzzle\" (season&nbsp;2, episode&nbsp;13), as an inside joke, [[Naval Criminal Investigative Service|NCIS]] agent Leroy Jethro Gibbs ([[Mark Harmon]]) is asked, \"What did Ducky look like when he was younger?\" Gibbs responds, \"Illya Kuryakin\".

Another similar title was ''The Man from S.T.U.D.'', by F. W. Paul ([[Paul W. Fairman]]), which published 11 titles between 1968 and 1971. [[Gardner Fox|Rod Gray]]'s \"Lady from L.U.S.T.\" (League of Undercover Spies and Terrorists) erotic fiction novels were a take-off of ''The Man from U.N.C.L.E''; 25 books in the series were published between 1968 and 1975.

[[Alma Cogan]] paid a similar tribute to the Russian agent in her single \"Love Ya Illya\", released in 1966 under the pseudonym \"Angela and the Fans\". In the 1980s, [[Martin Newell (musician)|The Cleaners from Venus]] penned \"Ilya Kuryakin Looked at Me\"; the song was later covered by [[The Jennifers]]. The English [[2 Tone (music genre)|2 Tone]] band [[The Specials]] made an instrumental song called \"Napoleon Solo\". It was also the name of a Danish 2 Tone band. Space\u2013surf band [[Man or Astro-man?]] covered the theme song for their 1994 EP ''[[Astro Launch]]''. Man or Astro-man are instrumental, not surf however.

[[Sebastian Moran]] after the death of [[Professor Moriarty]] at the [[Reichenbach Falls]] in the [[Sherlock Holmes]] story \"[[The Final Problem]]\". But in a second season episode, guest star [[Jessie Royce Landis]] plays a character who claims that she founded THRUSH.\n\nTHRUSH's aim was to conquer the world. <!--Napoleon Solo said, in \"The Green Opal Affair\", \"THRUSH believes in the two-party system \u2013 the masters and the slaves\", and in the pilot episode (\"The Vulcan Affair\"), that THRUSH \"kills people the way people kill flies \u2013 a reflex action \u2013 a flick of the wrist.\"--> THRUSH was considered so dangerous an organization that even governments who were ideologically opposed to each other \u2013 such as the United States and the [[Soviet Union]] \u2013 had cooperated in forming and operating the U.N.C.L.E. organization. Similarly, when Solo and Kuryakin held opposing political views, the friction between them in the story was held to a minimum. Although executive producer [[Norman Felton]] and Ian Fleming conceived Napoleon Solo, it was the producer [[Sam Rolfe]] who created the global U.N.C.L.E. hierarchy, and he included the Soviet agent, Illya Kuryakin. Unlike the CIA or [[Secret Intelligence Service|MI6]], U.N.C.L.E. was a global organization of agents from many countries and cultures.\n\n===Innocent character=== <!-- if THRUSH wants to subjugate humanity, humanity deserves a vote/delegate/representative -->\nThe creators decided an innocent character would be featured in each episode, giving the audience someone with whom to identify.<ref name=\"manfromuncle.org\"/> Despite many changes over four seasons, \"innocents\" remained a constant \u2013 from a suburban housewife in the pilot, \"The Vulcan Affair\" (film version: ''To Trap a Spy''), to those kidnapped in the final episode, \"The Seven Wonders of the World Affair.\"\n\n==Episodes==\n{{Main article|List of The Man from U.N.C.L.E. episodes}}\n\n===''Solo'' \u2013 the pilot===\n{{refimprove section|date=November 2014}}\nFilmed in color from late November to early December 1963, with locations at a [[Lever Brothers]] soap factory in California, the television pilot made as a 70-minute film was originally titled ''Ian Fleming's Solo'' and later shortened to ''Solo''. However, in February 1964 a law firm representing ''[[James Bond in film|James Bond]]'' movie producers [[Harry Saltzman]] and [[Albert R. Broccoli]] demanded an end to the use of Fleming's name in connection with the series and an end to use of the name and character \"Solo\", \"Napoleon Solo\" and \"Mr. Solo\". At that time filming was underway for the ''Bond'' movie ''[[Goldfinger (film)|Goldfinger]]'', in which [[Martin Benson (actor)|Martin Benson]] was playing a supporting character named \"Mr. Solo\", being an [[American Mafia]] boss murdered by [[Auric Goldfinger|the main villain]]. The claim was the name \"Solo\" had been sold to them by Fleming, and Fleming could not again use it. Within five days Fleming had signed an [[affidavit]] that nothing in the Solo pilot infringed any of his Bond characters, but the threat of legal action resulted in a settlement in which the name Napoleon Solo could be kept but the title of the show had to change.\n\nThe role of the head of U.N.C.L.E. in the pilot was Mr. Allison, played by [[Will Kuluva]], rather than Mr. Waverly, played by Leo G. Carroll, and David McCallum's Illya Kuryakin only had a brief role. Revisions to some scenes were shot for television, including those needed to feature Leo G. Carroll. The pilot episode was reedited to 50 minutes to fit a one-hour time slot, converted to black and white, and shown on television as \"The Vulcan Affair\".\n\nNBC in New York was not happy with the pilot. An executive wanted to drop the Russian character, Illya Kuryakin, from the cast, but he could not remember his name, saying \"K\u2013 K\u2013\". Felton replied \"Kuluva?\" and the executive replied \"That's it.\" Felton did not argue as he wanted to replace Kuluva anyway. When later asked who the replacement was, Felton replied, \"Leo G. Carroll\". The executive said that he was too old to replace David McCallum as Solo's sidekick. Felton explained he had replaced Kuluva, and that it was too late to get rid of McCallum, the contracts already having been signed. It has been rumored for years that the executive in question was [[Grant Tinker]], then the husband of [[Mary Tyler Moore]] and later chairman of NBC.\n\nAdditional color sequences with [[Luciana Paluzzi]] were shot in April 1964, and then added to the pilot for MGM to release it outside the United States as a [[B movie]] titled ''[[To Trap a Spy]]''.<ref name=\"Heitland\"/>{{Page needed|date=April 2017}} This premiered in [[Hong Kong]] in November 1964. The extra scenes were reedited to tone down their sexuality, and then used in the regular series in the episode \"The Four-Steps Affair\".\n\nBeyond extra scenes for the feature film, and revised scene shots and edits made for the television episode, there are other differences among the three versions of the story. Before the show went into full production there was concern from [[MGM]] that the name of THRUSH for the pilot's international criminal organization sounded too much like [[SMERSH]], the international spy-killing organization in Fleming's Bond series. The studio suggested Raven, Shark, Squid, Vulture, Tarantula, Snipe, Sphinx, Dooom{{sic}}, and Maggot (the last used in early scripts). Although no legal action took place, the name was dubbed as \"WASP\" in the feature version ''To Trap a Spy''. The original pilot kept THRUSH (presumably since it was not intended to be released to the public in that version). Felton and Rolfe pushed for the reinstatement of \"THRUSH\". It turned out that WASP could not be used, since [[Gerry Anderson]]'s British television series ''[[Stingray (1964 TV series)|Stingray]]'' was based on an organization called W.A.S.P. (World Aquanaut Security Patrol). By May 1964, THRUSH was retained for the television episode edit of the pilot. Despite this, WASP was used by the feature film in Japan in late 1964, and it was left in the American release in 1966. \n\nAnother change among the three versions of the pilot story was the cover name for the character of Elaine May Donaldson. In the original pilot it was Elaine Van Nessen; in the television version and the feature version it was Elaine Van Every. Illya Kuryakin's badge number is 17 in the pilot, rather than 2 during the series, and Solo's hair, after new footage was added, changed back and forth from a slicked back style to the less severe style he wore throughout the series.\n\nWith the popularity of the show and the spy craze, ''To Trap a Spy'' and the second U.N.C.L.E. feature ''[[The Spy with My Face]]'' were released in the United States as an MGM [[double feature]] in early 1966.\n\n===Season 1===\n[[File:Kurt Russell Robert Vaughn Man From UNCLE 1964.JPG|thumb|180px|Vaughn and a young [[Kurt Russell]] in \"The Finny Foot Affair\"]]\nThe show's first season was in [[Black-and-White|black and white]]. Rolfe created a kind of [[Alice in Wonderland|''Alice's Adventures In Wonderland'']] world, where mundane everyday life would intersect with the looking-glass fantasy of international espionage which lay just beyond. The U.N.C.L.E. universe was one where the weekly \"innocent\" would get caught up in a series of fantastic adventures, in a battle of good and evil.<ref name=\"manfromuncle.org\"/>\n\nU.N.C.L.E. headquarters in New York City was most-frequently entered by a [[secret passage|secret entrance]] in Del Floria's Tailor Shop. Another entrance was through The Masque Club.

The episodes followed a naming convention where each title was in the form of \"The ***** Affair\", such as \"The Vulcan Affair\", \"The Mad, Mad, Tea Party Affair\", and \"The Waverly Ring Affair\", etc.  The only exception was \"Alexander the Greater Affair\". The first season episode \"The Green Opal Affair\" establishes that U.N.C.L.E. uses the term \"affair\" to refer to its different missions.\n\nRolfe endeavored to make the implausible elements in the series seem not only feasible but entertaining.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} In the series, frogmen emerge from wells in [[Iowa]], shootouts occur between U.N.C.L.E. and THRUSH agents in a crowded [[Manhattan]] movie theater, and top-secret organizations are hidden behind innocuous [[brownstone]] facades. The series began to dabble in [[Spy-fi (neologism)|science-fiction plots]], beginning with \"The Double Affair\" in which a THRUSH agent, made to look like Solo through plastic surgery, infiltrates a secret U.N.C.L.E. facility where an immensely powerful weapon called \"Project Earthsave\" is stored; according to the dialogue, the weapon was developed to protect against a potential alien threat to Earth. ''[[The Spy with My Face]]'' was the theatrical film version of this episode.\n\nIn its first season ''The Man from U.N.C.L.E.'' competed against ''[[The Red Skelton Show]]'' on [[CBS]] and [[Walter Brennan]]'s short-lived ''[[The Tycoon (TV series)|The Tycoon]]'' on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]. During this time producer Norman Felton told [[Alan Caillou]] and several of the series writers to make the show more [[tongue in cheek]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Weaver|first1=Tom|title=Science Fiction and Fantasy Film Flashbacks: Conversations with 24 Actors, Writers, Producers and Directors from the Golden Age|date=2005|publisher=McFarland Press|location=Jefferson, North Carolina|isbn=0786420707|page=52}}</ref>\n\n===Seasons 2\u20134===\n[[File:David McCallum Man From UNCLE 1965.JPG|left|thumb|160px|David McCallum as Illya Kuryakin]]\nSwitching to [[color]], ''U.N.C.L.E.'' continued to enjoy huge popularity. When Rolfe left the show at the conclusion of the first season, David Victor became the new [[showrunner]]. Over the next three seasons, five different showrunners would supervise the ''U.N.C.L.E.'' franchise, and each one took the show in a direction that differed considerably from that of the first season. In an attempt to emulate the success of [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s mid-season hit ''[[Batman (TV series)|Batman]]'', which had proved hugely popular with its debut in early 1966, ''U.N.C.L.E.'' moved swiftly towards self-parody and slapstick.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> In contrast to other seasons, the fourth and final season had a recurring female character, Lisa Rogers, played by Barbara Moore in ten episodes.<ref>Barbara Moore, imdb biography, https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0600923/?ref_=tt_cl_t10</ref>\n\nDuring the third season the producers made a conscious decision to increase the level of humor.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> This new direction resulted in a severe [[Nielsen ratings|ratings]] drop, and nearly resulted in the show's cancellation. It was renewed for a fourth season and an attempt was made to go back to serious storytelling, but the ratings never recovered and ''U.N.C.L.E.'' was cancelled midway through the season.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n==Spin-off: ''The Girl from U.N.C.L.E.''==\n{{unreferenced section|date=September 2016}}\nThe series was popular enough to generate a spin-off series, ''[[The Girl from U.N.C.L.E.]]'' (1966\u201367) The \"girl\" was first introduced during ''The Man From U.N.C.L.E.'' episode \"[[The Moonglow Affair]]\" (February&nbsp;25, 1966) and was then played by [[Mary Ann Mobley]]. The spin-off series ran for one season, starring [[Stefanie Powers]] as agent \"April Dancer\", a character name credited to Ian Fleming, and Noel Harrison as agent Mark Slate (who had been played substantially differently by actor [[Norman Fell]] in the pilot). There was some crossover between the two shows, and [[Leo G. Carroll]] played Mr. Waverly in both programs, becoming the second actor in American television to star as the same character in two separate series.\n\n===Reunion TV movie===\n{{main article|Return of the Man from U.N.C.L.E.}}\n{{unreferenced section|date=September 2017}}\nA reunion [[telefilm]], ''Return of the Man from U.N.C.L.E.'' subtitled ''The Fifteen Years Later Affair,'' was broadcast on [[CBS]] in America on April&nbsp;5, 1983, with Vaughn and McCallum reprising their roles, and [[Patrick Macnee]] replacing [[Leo G. Carroll]], who had died in 1972, as the head of U.N.C.L.E. A framed picture of Carroll appeared on his desk. The movie included a tribute to Ian Fleming via a cameo appearance by an unidentified secret agent with the initials \"JB\". The part was played by [[George Lazenby]] who was shown driving James Bond's trademark vehicle, an [[Aston Martin DB5]]. One character, identifying him, says that it is \"just like ''[[On Her Majesty's Secret Service (film)|On Her Majesty's Secret Service]]''\", which was Lazenby's only Bond film.\n\nThe movie, written by Michael Sloan and directed by [[Ray Austin (director)|Ray Austin]], briefly filled in the missing years. THRUSH had been put out of business, and the escape of its leader from prison begins the story. Solo and Kuryakin, who had retired, are recalled by U.N.C.L.E. to recapture the escapee and defeat THRUSH once and for all. Rather than reuniting the agents and recapturing their chemistry, however, the agents are separated and paired with younger agents. Like most similar reunion films, this production was considered a trial balloon for a possible new series which never materialized.\n\nAlthough some personnel from the original series were involved (like composer [[Gerald Fried]] and director of photography Fred Koenekamp), the movie was not produced by MGM but by Michael Sloan Productions in association with [[Viacom Productions]].\n\n==Theme music==\n{{refimprove|date=September 2017}}\nThe theme music, written by [[Jerry Goldsmith]], changed slightly each season.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.manfromuncle.org/sound.htm |title=U.N.C.L.E. - The Soundtrack |publisher=Manfromuncle.org |date= |accessdate=2011-03-05}}</ref> Goldsmith provided only three original scores and was succeeded by [[Morton Stevens]], who composed four scores for the series. After Stevens, [[Walter Scharf]] did six scores, and [[Lalo Schifrin]] did two. [[Gerald Fried]] was composer from season two through the beginning of season four. The final composers were [[Robert Drasnin]] (who also scored episodes of ''[[Mission: Impossible (1966 TV series)|Mission: Impossible]]'', as did Schifrin, Scharf, and Fried), [[Nelson Riddle]] (whose score for the two-part episode \"The Concrete Overcoat Affair\" was so loathed by Norman Felton that he never hired the composer again, although the music did get tracked into other third-season episodes), and Richard Shores.\n\nThe music reflected the show's changing seasons. Goldsmith, Stevens, and Scharf composed dramatic scores in the first season using brass, unusual time signatures and martial rhythms. Gerald Fried and Robert Drasnin opted for a lighter approach in the second, employing harpsichords and bongos. By the third season, the music, like the show, had become more camp, exemplified by an R&B organ and saxophone version of the theme. The fourth season's attempt at seriousness was duly echoed by Richard Shores' somber scores.\n\n==Guest stars and other actors==\n[[File:Jan Murray Patsy Kelly Pat Harrington Man From UNCLE.JPG|thumb|right|[[Jan Murray]], [[Patsy Kelly]], and [[Pat Harrington Jr.]] in \"The Hula Doll Affair\" (1967) ]]\nApart from Solo, Kuryakin and Waverly, very few recurring characters appeared on the show with any regularity. As a result, ''The Man from U.N.C.L.E.'' featured many high-profile guest performers during its three-and-a-half-year run.\n\n[[William Shatner]] and [[Leonard Nimoy]] appeared together in a 1964 episode, \"The Project Strigas Affair\", a full two years before ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]'' premiered. Shatner played a heroic civilian recruited for an U.N.C.L.E. mission, and Nimoy played the villain's henchman.

[[Robert Culp]] played the villain in 1964's \"The Shark Affair\".

Usually cast as a scientist, he played the primary villain in one episode, \"The Cherry Blossom Affair\". Another five-time guest star was [[Jill Ireland]], who at the time was married to David McCallum. [[Ricardo Montalb\u00e1n]] appeared in two episodes as the primary villain. \"The Five Daughters Affair\" featured a cameo appearance by [[Joan Crawford]].

Internally designated the \"U.N.C.L.E. Special\", it was a modular [[Semiautomatic firearm|semiautomatic]] weapon. The basic [[pistol]] could be converted into a longer-range [[carbine]] by attaching a long barrel, an extendable shoulder stock, a telescopic sight, and an extended [[magazine (firearm)|magazine]]. In this \"carbine mode\", the pistol could fire on full automatic. This capability brought authorities to the set to investigate reports that the studio was illegally manufacturing [[machine guns]]. They threatened to confiscate the prop guns and it took a tour of the prop room to convince them that these were actually \"dummy\" pistols incapable of firing live ammunition. The actual pistol used as the prop was the [[Mauser#Mauser Model 1934 pocket pistol|Mauser Model 1934 Pocket Pistol]], but it was unreliable, it jammed constantly, and it was dwarfed by the carbine accessories. It was soon replaced by the larger and more-reliable [[Walther P38]].\n\nThe long magazine was actually a standard magazine with a dummy extension, but it inspired several small-arms manufacturers to begin making long magazines for various pistols. While many of these continue to be available 40 years later, long magazines were not available for the P38 for some years.{{clarify|date=April 2012|reason=which years? Not for some years then, in the 60s, or not for some years 40 years afterwards?}}\n\nTHRUSH had a range of weaponry of its own, much of them only in the development stage before being destroyed by the heroes. A notable item was the [[infrared]] [[sniperscope]], enabling villains to aim gunfire in total darkness. The prop was built from a U.S. Army-surplus [[M1 carbine]], with a vertical foregrip and barrel compensator, and using army-surplus infrared scopes. The infrared [[Special effects|special effect]] was achieved using a searchlight to illuminate the target. The fully equipped carbines were seen only once, in \"The Iowa Scuba Affair\". After that, a mockup of the scope was used to make handling easier.\n\nGerman small arms were well represented in the series. Not only were P38s frequently seen (both as the U.N.C.L.E. Special and in standard configuration), but also the [[Luger P-08]] pistol. In the pilot episode \"The Vulcan Affair\", Illya Kuryakin is carrying a [[M1911 pistol|standard U.S. Army .45 caliber pistol]]. The [[Mauser C96|\"Broomhandle\" Mauser carbines]] and [[MP 40]] machine pistols were favored by opponents. U.N.C.L.E. also used the MP 40. Beginning in the third season, both U.N.C.L.E and THRUSH agents used rifles that were either the Spanish [[CETME]] or the [[Heckler & Koch G3]] (based on the CETME).\n\n==Awards and nominations==\n{{unreferenced section|date=September 2017}}\n[[Emmy Awards]]\n*1965: Outstanding Individual Achievements in Entertainment \u2013 Actors and Performers (nominated) \u2013 David McCallum<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.emmys.com/awards/nominees-winners/1965|title=1965 Nominees/Winners|last=|first=|date=|work=Television Academy|access-date=2017-10-04|language=en}}</ref>\n*1965: Outstanding Program Achievements in Entertainment (nominated) \u2013 Sam Rolfe<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.emmys.com/awards/nominees-winners/1965?page=1|title=Nominees/Winners|work=Television Academy|access-date=2017-10-04|language=en}}</ref>\n*1966: Outstanding Continued Performance by an Actor in a Leading Role in a Dramatic Series (nominated) \u2013 David McCallum<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.emmys.com/awards/nominees-winners/1966|title=Nominees/Winners|work=Television Academy|access-date=2017-10-04|language=en}}</ref>\n*1966: Outstanding Dramatic Series (nominated) \u2013 Norman Felton<ref name=\"auto\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.emmys.com/awards/nominees-winners/1966?page=1|title=Nominees/Winners|work=Television Academy|access-date=2017-10-04|language=en}}</ref>\n*1966: Outstanding Performance by an Actor in a Supporting Role in a Drama (nominated) \u2013 Leo G.

The episodes with the extra footage that made it to theaters were the original pilot, \"The Vulcan Affair\", retitled ''[[To Trap a Spy]]'' and \"The Double Affair\" retitled as ''[[The Spy with My Face]]''. Both had added sex and violence, new sub-plots and guest stars not in the original TV episodes. They were released in early 1966 as an ''U.N.C.L.E.'' double-feature program first run in neighborhood theaters, bypassing the customary downtown movie palaces which were still thriving in the mid-1960s and where new movies usually played for weeks or months before coming to outlying screens.\n\nA selling point to seeing these films theatrically was that they were being shown in color, at a time when most people had only black and white TVs (and indeed the two first-season episodes that were expanded to feature length, while filmed in color, had only been broadcast in black and white). The words \"in color\" featured prominently on the trailers, TV spots, and posters for the film releases. The episodes used to make U.N.C.L.E. films were not included in the packages of television episodes screened outside the United States.<ref name=\"Heitland\"/>{{Page needed|date=April 2017}}\n\nSubsequent two-part episodes, beginning with the second season premiere, \"Alexander The Greater Affair\", retitled ''One Spy Too Many'' for its theatrical release, were developed into one complete feature film with only occasional extra sexy and violent footage added to them, sometimes as just inserts. In the case of ''One Spy Too Many,'' a subplot featuring [[Yvonne Craig]] as an U.N.C.L.E. operative carrying on a flirtatious relationship with Solo was also added to the film; Craig does not appear in the television episodes.\n\nThe later films were not released in America, only overseas, but the first few did well in American theaters and remain one of the rare examples of a television show released in paid theatrical engagements. With the exception of the two-part episode \"The Five Daughters Affair\", shown as part of [[Granada Plus]]'s run of the series, the episodes which became movies have never aired on British television.\n\nThe films in the series:\n* ''[[To Trap a Spy]]'' (1964)\n* ''[[The Spy with My Face]]'' (1965)\n* ''[[One Spy Too Many]]'' (1966)\n* ''[[One of Our Spies Is Missing]]'' (1966)\n* ''[[The Spy in the Green Hat]]'' (1966)\n* ''[[The Karate Killers]]'' (1967)\n* ''[[The Helicopter Spies]]'' (1968)\n* ''[[How to Steal the World]]'' (1968)\n\n===2015 remake===\n{{main article|The Man from U.N.C.L.E.

In the US, there was a [[Gold Key Comics]] series which ran for twenty-two issues. Entertainment Publishing released an eleven-issue series of one- and two-part stories from January 1987 to September 1988 that updated U.N.C.L.E. to the 1980s, while largely ignoring the reunion TV-movie. A two-part comics story, \"The Birds of Prey Affair\", was put out by [[Millennium Publications]] in 1993, which showcased the return of a smaller, more-streamlined version of THRUSH, controlled by Dr. Egret, who had melded with the Ultimate Computer. The script was written by [[Mark Ellis (American author)|Mark Ellis]] and Terry Collins, with artwork by Nick Choles, and transplanted the characters into the 1990s.\n\nTwo ''Man from U.N.C.L.E.'' strips were originated for the British market in the 1960s (some Gold Key material was also reprinted), the most notable for ''Lady Penelope'' comic, which launched in January 1966. This was replaced by a ''Girl from U.N.C.L.E.'' strip in January 1967. ''Man from U.N.C.L.E.'' also featured in the short-lived title ''Solo'' (published between February and September 1967) and some text stories appeared in ''TV Tornado''.\n\nIn 2015\u20132016, [[DC Comics]] launched ''Batman '66 Meets the Man from U.N.C.L.E.'', a crossover with its ''[[Batman '66]]'' series.\n\n===Merchandise===\nLicensed merchandise included a ''Man from U.N.C.L.E.'' [[digest size|digest-sized]] story magazine, [[board game]]s, Gilbert action figures, [[Aurora Plastics Corporation|Aurora]] plastic model kits, lunch boxes, and [[toy gun]]s.<ref>Paquette, Brian & Howley, Paul ''The Toys From U.N.C.L.E.: Memorabilia and Collectors Guide'' Entertainment Publishing; First edition. (January 1, 1990)</ref>\n\nAn example of this, the Louis Marx \"Target Gun Set\", a dart-gun shooting-game released in the form of a quasi-playset, is built around the setting of U.N.C.L.E. headquarters in New York City. Art on the cardboard stand displays both the U.N.C.L.E. and THRUSH logos, and a half-dozen soft plastic figures per \"side\" were provided, including Solo, Kuryakin and Waverly. The game measures {{convert|57|x|18|in|cm}}; the figures, at {{convert|6|in|cm}}, represent one of the few attempts Marx made at supplementing its 6-inch figure line. The U.N.C.L.E. figures are cast in blue, except for a single (unnamed) figure in tan; THRUSH agents are cast in gray. Marx was released an arcade game licensed under ''The Man from U.N.C.L.E.''<ref>{{cite journal|title=Open Channel 'D' with the Marx U.N.C.L.E.

Pictured: [[Robert Vaughn]].]]\nTwo dozen novels were based upon ''Man from U.N.C.L.E.'' and published between 1965 and 1968. Unhampered by television censors, the novels were generally grittier and more violent than the televised episodes. The series sold in the millions, and was the largest TV-novel tie-in franchise until surpassed by ''[[Dark Shadows]]'' and ''[[List of Star Trek novels|Star Trek]]''.\n# ''The Man from U.N.C.L.E.'' ({{a.k.a.}} ''The Thousand Coffins Affair'') by [[Michael Avallone]]. When villages in Africa and Scotland are wiped out by a plague of madness, Solo and Kuryakin dig up a graveyard and a monster named Golgotha.\n# ''The Doomsday Affair'' by [[Harry Whittington (writer)|Harry Whittington]]. The agents must find the mystery man \"Tixe Ylno\" before he triggers war between the US and the USSR.\n# ''The Copenhagen Affair'' by John Oram. UFOs are buzzing Europe, and the U.N.C.L.E. agents crisscross Denmark to find the factory before THRUSH launches an armed fleet.\n# ''The Dagger Affair'' by [[David McDaniel]]. DAGGER fanatics have an energy damper that can shut down electrical fields, atomic reactions, and human beings, and even THRUSH is panicked. This is the novel in which McDaniel introduced the acronym for THRUSH, though it was never used by any other of the novelists nor on the show itself.\n# ''The Mad Scientist Affair'' by [[John T. Phillifent]]. The agents stop biochemist \"King Mike\" from poisoning London, then discover his second plan is to contaminate the entire North Sea.\n# ''The Vampire Affair'' by David McDaniel. Napoleon and Illya don't believe in vampires and werewolves, but an U.N.C.L.E. agent has died, so they must investigate an ancient castle in Transylvanian Romania.\n# ''The Radioactive Camel Affair'' by Peter Leslie. Solo joins a caravan and Kuryakin threads a war zone to reach a missile base deep in the Sudan hinterlands.\n# ''The Monster Wheel Affair'' by David McDaniel. The agents canvass the globe and infiltrate a remote island to confirm an inexplicable space station belongs to Egypt.\n# ''The Diving Dames Affair'' by Peter Leslie. The deaths of two merry missionaries lead the agents to the plains of Brazil and a giant dam with no apparent purpose.\n# ''The Assassination Affair'' by [[J. Hunter Holly]]. Surviving assassins' bullets and a \"do-it-yourself murder room\", the agents follow THRUSH to desolated Michigan farms and a scheme to starve the world.\n# ''The Invisibility Affair'' by Thomas Stratton ([[Buck Coulson]] and [[Gene DeWeese]]). The agents track an invisible dirigible to a submarine in Lake Michigan \u2013 and a plot to hijack an entire country.\n# ''The Mind Twisters Affair'' by Thomas Stratton. People in a college town are unaccountably catatonic, euphoric, and raging. The agents must ferret out who and how before the \"experiment\" goes nationwide.\n# ''The Rainbow Affair'' by David McDaniel. The agents consult every classic fictional spy and detective in England to find the world's best bank robber before THRUSH can recruit or kill him.\n# ''The Cross of Gold Affair'' by Fredric Davies (Ron Ellik and Fredric Langley). Clues hidden in crossword puzzles lead the agents, hippies, and frogmen to a Coney Island death-trap to stop the biggest heist in history.\n# ''The Utopia Affair'' by David McDaniel. Solo must command U.N.C.L.E. North America while Waverly is on a forced six-week vacation, and an undercover Illya tries to protect Waverly from THRUSH assassins.\n# ''The Splintered Sunglasses Affair'' by Peter Leslie\n# ''The Hollow Crown Affair'' by David McDaniel. In the last published David McDaniel's novel, THRUSH Agent Ward and Irene Baldwin from ''The Dagger Affair'' return in a battle against an U.N.C.L.E. lab chief who has defected to THRUSH.\n# ''The Unfair Fare Affair'' by Peter Leslie\n# ''The Power Cube Affair'' by John T. Phillifent\n# ''The Corfu Affair'' by John T. Phillifent\n# ''The Thinking Machine Affair'' by Joel Bernard\n# ''The Stone Cold Dead in the Market Affair'' by John Oram\n# ''The Finger in the Sky Affair'' by Peter Leslie\n# ''The Final Affair'' by David McDaniel. Completed but never published, the manuscript has been circulated by fans.\n\nVolumes 10\u201315 and 17 of the series were only published in the United States.\n\n''The Rainbow Affair'' is notable for unnamed cameos by [[Simon Templar|The Saint]], [[Miss Marple]], [[John Steed]], [[Emma Peel]], [[Willie Garvin]], [[Tommy Hambledon]], [[Neddie Seagoon]], [[Father Brown]], a retired [[Sherlock Holmes]] (aged nearly 100), and [[Dr. Fu Manchu]].\n\n[[Whitman Publishing|Whitman Books]] published three hardcover novels aimed at young readers: ''The Affair of the Gunrunners' Gold'' and ''The Affair of the Gentle Saboteur'' by [[Brandon Keith (Writer)|Brandon Keith]], and ''The Calcutta Affair'' by George S. Elrick. The first two broke the \"...Affair\" naming convention used by the franchise on most other TV episodes and book releases.\n[[Image:ManFromUNCLEbook.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Rare children's storybook based upon ''The Man from U.N.C.L.E.'' Left to right: [[David McCallum]], [[Robert Vaughn]] and [[Leo G. Carroll]].]]\nA children's storybook was written by [[Walter B. Gibson]] entitled ''The Coin of El Diablo Affair''.\n\nThe digest-sized ''Man from U.N.C.L.E. Magazine'' featured original [[novella]]s continuing the adventures of Solo and Kuryakin. Published under the house name \"Robert Hart Davis\", they were written by such authors as John Jakes, Dennis Lynds, and Bill Pronzini. 24 issues, which also offered original crime and spy-fiction short stories and novelettes, and occasional SF and fantasy reprints under the title \"Department of Lost Stories\", ran monthly from February 1966 to January 1968. An additional novella entitled \"The Vanishing City Affair\" was advertised on page 140 of the January 1968 issue for the proposed (but never published) February 1968 issue. It is as yet unconfirmed, however, if this novella was shelved for possible future release elsewhere or if it was ever written at all.\n\nThree science-fiction novels appear to be rewrites of \"orphaned\" U.N.C.L.E. novel outlines or manuscripts: ''Genius Unlimited'' by John Rackham (a pseudonym of Phillifent), ''The Arsenal Out of Time'' by McDaniel, and ''Agent Of T.E.R.R.A. #1: The Flying Saucer Gambit'' by Jack Jardine (writing as Larry Maddock).\n\n===TV Annuals===\nThere have been four TV Annuals published in UK between 1967 and 1970 by World Distributors which features written stories and reprint of a Gold Key story which were never published in the UK.\n\n==Home media==\nIn November 2007, after coming to an agreement with [[Warner Home Video]], [[Time-Life]] released a 41&nbsp;DVD set (region&nbsp;1) for direct order, with sales through stores scheduled for fall 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/newsitem.cfm?NewsID=7563|title=The Man from U.N.C.L.E.

References in other television shows have continued over the years, including a 2010 episode of ''[[Mad Men]]'' called \"The Chrysanthemum and the Sword\". It has also been referenced in other television shows including ''[[Get Smart]],'' ''[[Angry Beavers]],'' and ''[[Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In|Laugh-In]].''\n\nThe TV show ''[[My Favorite Martian]]'' (1963\u20131966) also used CRUSH as the name of the evil spy organization, spoofing THRUSH in two episodes. In the season two episode \"006 3/4\", Tim finds a distress note from Agent 006 of Top Secret, who is being tracked by CRUSH. Top Secret asks Tim to assist Agent 004, to save 006. In the season three episode \"Butterball\" Uncle Martin must rescue Tim who is kidnapped by Butterball.\n\nA 1966 episode of ''[[The Avengers (TV series)|The Avengers]]'' was titled \"[[The Girl from AUNTIE]]\".\n\nIn a 1966 episode of the sitcom ''[[Please Don't Eat the Daisies (TV series)|Please Don't Eat the Daisies]]'' titled \"Say UNCLE\", the young twins are fans of ''The Man From U.N.C.L.E.'' and become convinced that their father Jim is a secret agent. In one scene, they watch Jim emerge from a tailor shop similar to Del Florio's. Another man entering the shop asks Jim for a match, and Jim gives him his matchbook. The boys are astonished, because the other man is David McCallum, identified in the ending credits as Illya Kuryakin; they believe their father has just passed a secret message to the \"real-life\" Illya Kuryakin. The scene ends with the ''U.N.C.L.E'' scene transition: the action freezes and goes out of focus.<ref>{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XD5vtf-x9TE|title=ILLYA KURYAKIN on PDETD|date=15 October 2007|work=YouTube}}</ref>\n\nIt was also referenced in [[Glad (company)|Glad]] commercials in the late 1960s and early 1970s, which starred the \"Man from GLAD\", a trenchcoat-wearing agent who flew around in his combination boat/helicopter demonstrating Glad products to suburban housewives and saving the day.\n\nIn 1970, a \"secret agent\" theme was used by Australian confectionery manufacturer [[Allen's (confectionery)|Allen's]] to market their Anticol cough lozenges, with TV commercials running under the title \"The Man From A.N.T.I.C.O.L.\", featuring agent \"Napoleon Brandy\" combatting illnesses being spread by the agents of S.L.A.S.H.<ref>{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=en_zH3lxEig|title=Allen's Anticol - TV commercial (1970)|date=6 March 2009|work=YouTube}}</ref><ref>{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_48RBPkta0|title=Allen's Anticol - TV commercial (1970)|date=6 August 2016|work=YouTube}}</ref>\n\nIn a late 1986 episode of ''[[The A-Team]],'' [[Robert Vaughn]] \u2013 who had been added to the show's cast as mysterious retired agent for the show's final season, as part of an effort to revive flagging ratings \u2013 was reunited with guest star David McCallum, in an episode entitled \"The 'Say U.N.C.L.E.' Affair\". This story paid homage to ''The Man from U.N.C.L.E.,'' complete with chapter titles, the word \"affair\" in the title, the phrase \"Open Channel D\", similar scene transitions, and much mention of Vaughn's and McCallum's respective characters having once worked closely together as agents.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.legendarytv.com/the_a-team/the_a-team_robert_vaughn.asp |title=The A-Team, Robert Vaughn, General Stockwell |publisher=Legendarytv.com |date=1932-11-22 |accessdate=2011-03-05}}</ref> But in this story, McCallum's agent had turned villainous, selling out to the enemy and now capturing Vaughn to try to find out the whereabouts of a Soviet jet fighter.\n\nBeginning in 2003, McCallum starred in the CBS television series ''[[NCIS (TV series)|NCIS]]'' as Dr. Donald \"Ducky\" Mallard, M.D., a medical examiner. During the episode \"The Meat Puzzle\" (season&nbsp;2, episode&nbsp;13), as an inside joke, [[Naval Criminal Investigative Service|NCIS]] agent Leroy Jethro Gibbs ([[Mark Harmon]]) is asked, \"What did Ducky look like when he was younger?\" Gibbs responds, \"Illya Kuryakin\". The photo supposedly of a younger Ducky is actually a promotional photo from McCallum's ''Man from U.N.C.L.E.'' days.\n\nOn the fifth episode of the fourth season of ''[[Mad Men]]'' (2010), \"[[The Chrysanthemum and the Sword (Mad Men)|The Chrysanthemum and the Sword]]\", as Sally Draper is watching an episode of the show at a [[sleepover]], she is caught by her friend's mother absent-mindedly masturbating (apparently to David McCallum's Illya) while staring at the television. The episode shown is approximately correct for the year and month (March 1965) the ''[[Mad Men]]'' episode is set in.\n\n''[[Ben Elton: The Man from Auntie]]'' was a British television comedy series written and performed by Ben Elton. The title of the series was a play on words of both the American spy series ''The Man from U.N.C.L.E.'' and \"Auntie\", an informal name for the BBC.\n\nA scene from ''The Man From U.N.C.L.E.'' is shown in the HBO movie ''[[Temple Grandin (film)|Temple Grandin]],'' the biographical movie about [[Temple Grandin|the high-functioning autistic woman]] who overcame many of her symptoms to acquire a Ph.D. in Animal Sciences, and in an early scene from the film, [[Claire Danes]], who played Grandin in the film, repeated a line from the episode \"[[List of The Man from U.N.C.L.E. episodes#Season 1 (1964\u201365)|The Gazebo in the Maze Affair]]\": \"Would you like for me to open the gate?\"\n\nThe TV show was mentioned in the 2019 film ''[[Once Upon a Time in Hollywood]]''. There's a scene where Rick Dalton ([[Leonardo DiCaprio]]) is told by casting agent Marvin Schwarz ([[Al Pacino]]) that due to Dalton playing the heavy in weekly television, he'll get [[typecast]]ed to play the heavy in other media.\n\n===Comic books===\n[[Gold Key Comics]] released comic book series based on The Man from U.N.C.L.E in 1965 - 1969 and it ran for 22 issues. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.comics.org/series/7695/|title=GCD :: Series :: The Man from U.N.C.L.E.|website=www.comics.org}}</ref>\n\nThe 1965\u20131969 comic book series [[T.H.U.N.D.E.R. Agents]] (The Higher United Nations Defense Enforcement Reserves) ([[Tower Comics]]), a strange combination of secret agents and superheroes, was inspired by the success of ''The Man from U.N.C.L.E''.<ref>Misiroglu, Gina. ''The Superhero Book: The Ultimate Encyclopedia of Comic-Book Icons and Hollywood Heroes'' (Visible Ink Press, 2012), p. 374.</ref>\n\nThe Marvel Universe spy agency [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] and the Marvel Universe terror society [[Hydra (comics)|HYDRA]] (both created in 1965) were inspired by the ''Man From U.N.C.L.E.'' television program.<ref>Lee, Stan. \"Introduction,\" ''Son of Origins of Marvel Comics'' (Fireside Books, 1975).</ref>\n\n''The Man from R.I.V.E.R.D.A.L.E.'' was a ''Man From U.N.C.L.E.'' parody in [[Alternate universes in Archie Comics|Archie Comics]] published in 1966\u20131967. The comic portrayed Archie and the gang as a group of high-tech spies, as part of world-defense organization P.O.P. (an acronym for Protect our Planet). Their chief enemy was a counter-group known as C.R.U.S.H. (a spoof on THRUSH but whose acronym was never explained). Although Reggie, Veronica and Moose were initially cast as C.R.U.S.H. agents, they later became members of P.O.P. All the characters also had undefined acronyms for names (A.R.C.H.I.E., B.E.T.T.Y., etc.). R.I.V.E.R.D.A.L.E. stood for ''Really Impressive Vast Enterprise for Routing Dangerous Adversaries, Louts, Etc.''<ref>Boldman, Craig; Jeff Shutlz; and Rich Koslowski. \"I Was A Teen Age Comic Book Character! (Part Three),\" ''Archie, Free Comic Book Day Edition'' #2 (Archie Comics, 2004).</ref>\n\n===Books===\nTed Mark's ''The Man from O.R.G.Y.'' (\"Organization for the Rational Guidance of Youth\") series of [[erotic fiction]] [[paperback originals]] ([[Lancer Books]]) was a take-off of ''The Man from U.N.C.L.E''. The series ran from 1965 to 1981 and inspired [[The Man from O.R.G.Y.|a 1970 film]]. Another 34-title ''The Man from O.R.G.Y.'' series was published by [[Paperback Library]] from 1967 to 1973. Another similar title was ''The Man from S.T.U.D.'', by F. W. Paul ([[Paul W. Fairman]]), which published 11 titles between 1968 and 1971. [[Gardner Fox|Rod Gray]]'s \"Lady from L.U.S.T.\" (League of Undercover Spies and Terrorists) erotic fiction novels were a take-off of ''The Man from U.N.C.L.E''; 25 books in the series were published between 1968 and 1975. Other similar pastiche paperback series included ''The Man From T.O.M.C.A.T.'', ''The Miss from S.I.S.'', ''The Man from S.A.D.I.S.T.O.'', ''The Man from P.A.N.S.Y.'', and ''The Girl from H.A.R.D.''\n\n\"Lyra and Bon Bon and the Mares From S.M.I.L.E.\" is an upcoming title in the ''[[My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic]]'' chapter books published by [[Little, Brown, and Company]], to be released in March 2016.{{update inline|date=September 2017}}\n\n===Music===\nMusical examples include Elvis Costello's 1980 album ''[[Get Happy!! (Elvis Costello album)|Get Happy!!]]'' and an Argentinian funk duo who took the name [[Illya Kuryaki and the Valderramas]] honoring the fictitious spy. [[Alma Cogan]] paid a similar tribute to the Russian agent in her single \"Love Ya Illya\", released in 1966 under the pseudonym \"Angela and the Fans\". In the 1980s, [[Martin Newell (musician)|The Cleaners from Venus]] penned \"Ilya Kuryakin Looked at Me\"; the song was later covered by [[The Jennifers]]. The English [[2 Tone (music genre)|2 Tone]] band [[The Specials]] made an instrumental song called \"Napoleon Solo\". It was also the name of a Danish 2 Tone band. Space\u2013surf band [[Man or Astro-man?]] covered the theme song for their 1994 EP ''[[Astro Launch]]''. Man or Astro-man are instrumental, not surf however. The British trip-hop group [[Unkle|U.N.K.L.E.]] derive their name from the show.\n\n===Video games===\nThe protagonist in the spy-fi video games ''[[The Operative: No One Lives Forever]]'' (2000) and ''[[No One Lives Forever 2: A Spy in H.A.R.M.'s Way]]'' (2002) works for an organization known as U.N.I.T.Y. The villains in both games work for an organization known as H.A.R.M. In the first game the main character (Cate Archer) overhears two H.A.R.M. guards talking about how they thought Man from U.N.C.L.E. was a good show.\n\nThe video game ''[[Team Fortress 2]]'' (2007) has an achievement referencing the show, named \"The Man From P.U.N.C.T.U.R.E.\"\n\n=== Podcast ===\nThe fourth episode of the [http://www.paperbackwarrior.com/2019/07/paperback-warrior-podcast-episode-4.html?m=0 Paperback Warrior] podcast focuses on ''The Man from U.N.C.L.E.'' novels and their impact on the spy-fiction genre. The show's co-host, Tom Simon, discusses both Michael Avalone's ''The Man from U.N.C.L.E. (a.k.a. The Thousand Coffin Affair)'' novel as well as Harry Whittington's ''The Doomsday Affair''. Additionally, the co-host points to many successful authors contributing to the series' novels and novellas and suggests a three-book series entitled ''[http://www.paperbackwarrior.com/search/label/Man%20from%20W.A.R.?m=0 The Man from W.A.R.]'' by Michael Kurland was directly influenced by ''The Man from U.N.C.L.E.'' series.<ref>Simon Jr., T.J.(Co-Host).(2019, July 29).Paperback Warrior Podcast - It's a Manhunt![Audio podcast].</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Illya Kuryakin]]\n* [[Napoleon Solo]]\n* [[U.N.C.L.E.]]\n* [[The Man from U.N.C.L.E.
