Makira is in the easternmost part of the Solomon Islands. Makira was visited and named by \u00c1lvaro de Menda\u00f1a de Neira in 1588.

Major sentences can also be broken down into three categories: simple, compound, and complex.<ref name=\":0\" /> Major sentences consist of a noun phrase (NP) and verb phrase (VP).<ref name=\":0\" /> The subject of the sentence can often be broken down into these two types of phrases. Linking the two phrases (NP + VP) creates a compound sentence.

Minor sentences are interjections, yes-no Sentences, as well as Equational and descriptive sentences.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==== Interjections ====\nInterjections are most often verbs or nouns. When acting as an appellative, the 2nd person pronoun is used (regardless of the addition of ''-na''). Other interjections that are commonly used are ''kaia'' 'I do not know' and ''bwaia'' 'I do not understand''.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==== Yes-No ====\nThe next type of minor sentence is the yes-no sentence. These are questions that can be answered with 'yes' or 'no', in Arosi ''io'' and ''<nowiki/>'ai'a'', respectively. An example of a yes-no sentence is ''<nowiki/>'o tauaro? Io!'' 'Are you working? Yes!'.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n''<nowiki/><nowiki/>''\n\n==== Equational and Descriptive ====\nhe third type of minor sentence is the Equational and Descriptive sentence, which exists primarily due to the fact that there is no copula (any verb \"to be\") in Arosi. Equational and descriptional sentences are used to show equality between two different things.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Minor Sentences\n!Type of Sentence Structure\n!Arosi example\n!English Gloss\n!English translation\n|-\n|'''Interjection'''\n|''ai! kakarew, kokone mwatage, wauramoru!''\n|'Hi, take care, just look, brothers!'\n|Hi just look.

Pronouns in Arosi, to an extent, differ from pronouns of most other European languages. Gender is not distinguished in the third person in Arosi. Due to the non-distinguishable third-person pronoun, there is no equivalent to 'he' or 'she' in Arosi.<ref name=\":0\" /> In Arosi, pronouns also possess a dual number as well as a singular and plural. There is a distinction made in the first person non-singular between an 'inclusive' form ( we = you and I) and 'exclusive form [we = he (or they) and I] <ref name=\":0\" />\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Matrix of Arosi Pronouns\n! colspan=\"2\" |Independent\n! colspan=\"2\" |Suffixed\n! colspan=\"3\" |Separate\n|-\n!Person\n!\n!N.

In Arosi, it is important to understand the \"Time of Action\" and the \"State of Action\".<ref name=\":0\" /> There are also three different tense systems in Arosi: Indefinite, past and future.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Tense System\n!\n!Indefinite\n!Past\n!Present\n|-\n|'''Time'''\n| +\n| +\n| +\n|-\n|'''Aspect'''\n| +\n| +\n| -\n|-\n|'''Sequence'''\n| +\n| -\n| +\n|}\n\nThe \"+\" sign in the chart shows presence while the \"-\" sign means the \"lack of\" a given form.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Word Classification ===\nNouns are divided into simple nouns and a phrasal nouns. The majority of words involving the naming of people or objects are simple nouns. This does not apply to names of people.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===== Simple Nouns =====\nNouns in Arosi are not classified by gender. Different types of simple nouns are presented below:<ref name=\":0\" />\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Simple Nouns in Arosi\n!Objects\n!Persons\n!Personal Names\n|-\n|''hau'' 'stone'\n|''noni'' 'man'\n|''Uuri'' (m)\n|-\n|''sina'' 'sun'\n|''urao'' 'woman'\n|''Rota'' (f)\n|-\n|''i'a'' 'fish'\n|''gare'' 'child'\n|''Ianimanu'' (m)\n|-\n|''raraki'' 'thorn'\n|''sae'' 'human being'\n|''Suari'' (f)\n|}\n\n===== Phrasal Nouns =====\nUnlike simple nouns, phrasal noun have two lexicons of reference. Usually, lexical components are held together by the preposition ''i'', which can be translated as English 'of'. Sometimes, the word noni ''person'' is also used. For example, as in ''noni tauaro'' 'workman' (lit. \"person work\") or in ''hua i rumu'' 'oil flask'', where the words are joined by 'i'' instead.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==== Derived Nouns ====\nCompared to [[Malaita]] languages, Arosi has very few derived nouns. The primary prefixes used in Arosi are ''hai-'' and ''ha'i-''.<ref name=\":0\" /> Some examples of these prefixes in use are presented below:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Prefixes\n!Prefix\n!Base\n!Derived Abstract Noun\n|-\n|''hai-''\n|''totori-'' 'to hope'\n|''haitotori'' 'hope (as a noun)'\n|-\n|''ha'i-''\n|''ama-'' 'father'\n|''ha'i-ama-da'' 'father and son'\n|}\n\nArosi also uses suffixes. The most commonly used suffix is ''-ha'', which is most commonly used as a nominalizing suffix.<ref name=\":0\" />\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Suffixes\n!Suffix\n!Base\n!Derived abstract Noun\n|-\n|''-ha''\n|''taro'' 'tell'\n|''taroha'' 'news'\n|-\n|''-ha''\n|''goro'' 'good'\n|''goroha'' 'good condition'\n|}\n\n=== Interrogatives ===\nThe following is a list of question words:<ref name=\":0\" />\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Arosi interrogatives\n!Question word\n!Examples\n|-\n|''tei'' 'who'\n|\n|-\n|''taha'' 'what'\n|''e taha nassi?''

'Who has come?'\n|-\n|''nahei'' 'which'\n|''nahei ha' atora na raha'' 'Which is the great commandment?' (Matthew 22:36)\n|}\n\n== Numerals ==\nIn the table below, there is a translation of different numbers in Arosi. Due to the fact that Arosi has a base-ten numeral system, you will begin to notice a common pattern when counting numbers beyond ten. When counting, numerals are repeated then are followed by '''mana''', or '''ma''' meaning ''and'' as well as the verb '''adara''' meaning ''to exceed, to go beyond''.<ref name=\":0\" /> As you can see in the table, '''mana''' or '''ma''' is added between '''e ta\u2019 ai tangahuru''' and '''e ta\u2019 ai''' to combine the numerals for ten and one to make eleven. From 100 to 999 the same concept when counting numbers applies. The word for 1000 in Arosi is '''meru'''. Meru is the highest numeral term in Arosi. Arosi also has a very unique way of counting specific and particular items.<ref name=\":0\" />\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Numerals in Arosi \n!Spelling in Arosi\n!English Equvialent\n|-\n|'''e ta (in counting)'''\n|''One''\n|-\n|'''e rua'''\n|''Two''\n|-\n|'''e oru'''\n|''Three''\n|-\n|'''e hai'''\n|''Four'' \n|-\n|'''e rima''' \n|''Five'' \n|-\n|'''e ono''' \n|''Six'' \n|-\n|'''e biu'''\n|''Seven''\n|-\n|'''e waru'''\n|''Eight''\n|-\n|'''e siwa'''\n|''Nine'' \n|-\n|'''tangahuru'''\n|''Ten'' \n|-\n|'''e ta' ai tangahuru mana e ta' ai'''\n|''Eleven''\n|-\n|'''e rua tangahuru'''\n|''Twenty''\n|-\n|'''e oru tanahuru'''\n|''Thirty''\n|-\n|'''e hai tangarau e rua tangahuru mana biu'''\n|''Four-Hundred and Twenty-Seven''\n|-\n|'''Meru'''\n|''One-Thousand'' \n|}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* ''E rine nau maea ; mana heiaauhi inia, ma tarai rihunai ini haagorohi'' (Anglican Holy Communion manual with prayers for daily use and hymns, 1955)\n\n== External links ==\n{{Wiktionary|Category:Arosi lemmas}}\n* [http://justus.anglican.org/resources/bcp/Melanesia/arosi_intro.html Anglican liturgical texts in Arosi]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20111212053353/http://language.psy.auckland.ac.nz/austronesian/language.php?id=500 Word list (incomplete)]\n* [https://www.scriptureearth.org/data/aia/PDF/00-WNTaia-web.pdf New Testament in Arosi]\n* [http://paradisec.org.au/fieldnotes/SIARO.htm Arosi research papers]\n\n{{Languages of the Solomon Islands}}\n\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Arosi Language}}\n[[Category:Languages of the Solomon Islands]]\n[[Category:Malaita-San Cristobal languages]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Austronesian language sopken in the Solomon Islands}}\n{{Infobox language\n|name=Arosi\n|region=[[Makira]], [[Solomon Islands]]\n|ethnicity=\n|speakers=\n|date=\n|ref=e18\n|familycolor=Austronesian\n|fam2=[[Malayo-Polynesian languages|Malayo-Polynesian]]\n|fam3=[[Oceanic languages|Oceanic]]\n|fam4=[[Southeast Solomonic]]\n|fam5=\n|fam6=\n|fam7=\n|iso3=aia\n|glotto=aros1241\n|glottorefname=Arosi\n}}\n'''Arosi''' is a [[Southeast Solomonic languages|Southeast Solomonic]] language spoken on the island of [[Makira]].<ref name=\":0\" /> Arosi is primarily spoken by inhabitants who live to the west of the Wango River on [[Makira]] (formerly known as San Cristobal Island).

Usually, lexical components are held together by the preposition ''i'', which can be translated as English 'of'. Sometimes, the word noni ''person'' is also used. For example, as in ''noni tauaro'' 'workman' (lit. \"person work\") or in ''hua i rumu'' 'oil flask'', where the words are joined by 'i'' instead.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==== Derived Nouns ====\nCompared to [[Malaita]] languages, Arosi has very few derived nouns. The primary prefixes used in Arosi are ''hai-'' and ''ha'i-''.<ref name=\":0\" /> Some examples of these prefixes in use are presented below:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Prefixes\n!Prefix\n!Base\n!Derived Abstract Noun\n|-\n|''hai-''\n|''totori-'' 'to hope'\n|''haitotori'' 'hope (as a noun)'\n|-\n|''ha'i-''\n|''ama-'' 'father'\n|''ha'i-ama-da'' 'father and son'\n|}\n\nArosi also uses suffixes.

(Matthew 22:36)\n|}\n\n== Numerals ==\nIn the table below, there is a translation of different numbers in Arosi. Due to the fact that Arosi has a base-ten numeral system, you will begin to notice a common pattern when counting numbers beyond ten. When counting, numerals are repeated then are followed by '''mana''', or '''ma''' meaning ''and'' as well as the verb '''adara''' meaning ''to exceed, to go beyond''.<ref name=\":0\" /> As you can see in the table, '''mana''' or '''ma''' is added between '''e ta\u2019 ai tangahuru''' and '''e ta\u2019 ai''' to combine the numerals for ten and one to make eleven. From 100 to 999 the same concept when counting numbers applies. The word for 1000 in Arosi is '''meru'''. Meru is the highest numeral term in Arosi. Arosi also has a very unique way of counting specific and particular items.<ref name=\":0\" />\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Numerals in Arosi \n!Spelling in Arosi\n!English Equvialent\n|-\n|'''e ta (in counting)'''\n|''One''\n|-\n|'''e rua'''\n|''Two''\n|-\n|'''e oru'''\n|''Three''\n|-\n|'''e hai'''\n|''Four'' \n|-\n|'''e rima''' \n|''Five'' \n|-\n|'''e ono''' \n|''Six'' \n|-\n|'''e biu'''\n|''Seven''\n|-\n|'''e waru'''\n|''Eight''\n|-\n|'''e siwa'''\n|''Nine'' \n|-\n|'''tangahuru'''\n|''Ten'' \n|-\n|'''e ta' ai tangahuru mana e ta' ai'''\n|''Eleven''\n|-\n|'''e rua tangahuru'''\n|''Twenty''\n|-\n|'''e oru tanahuru'''\n|''Thirty''\n|-\n|'''e hai tangarau e rua tangahuru mana biu'''\n|''Four-Hundred and Twenty-Seven''\n|-\n|'''Meru'''\n|''One-Thousand'' \n|}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* ''E rine nau maea ; mana heiaauhi inia, ma tarai rihunai ini haagorohi'' (Anglican Holy Communion manual with prayers for daily use and hymns, 1955)\n\n== External links ==\n{{Wiktionary|Category:Arosi lemmas}}\n* [http://justus.anglican.org/resources/bcp/Melanesia/arosi_intro.html Anglican liturgical texts in Arosi]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20111212053353/http://language.psy.auckland.ac.nz/austronesian/language.php?id=500 Word list (incomplete)]\n* [https://www.scriptureearth.org/data/aia/PDF/00-WNTaia-web.pdf New Testament in Arosi]\n* [http://paradisec.org.au/fieldnotes/SIARO.htm Arosi research papers]\n\n{{Languages of the Solomon Islands}}\n\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Arosi Language}}\n[[Category:Languages of the Solomon Islands]]\n[[Category:Malaita-San Cristobal languages]]\n", "name_user": "Austronesier", "label": "safe", "comment": "typo", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arosi_language"}

The first episode was aired on 17 August 2010, with its first four series broadcast on [[BBC Two]], until its growing popularity led the [[BBC]] to move it to [[BBC One]] for the next three series.

The applicants to the show are assessed by a researcher, followed by an audition in London with two of their bakes. They then undergo a screen test and an interview with a producer.

The contestants are assessed by the judges who then choose a \"[[List of The Great British Bake Off Star Bakers|Star Baker]]\" for the week (introduced in series 2), and a contestant is also eliminated although if the contestant numbers in certain years are not even or there is an non-elimination a week before, then two bakers may be eliminated. In the final round, three bakers are left and a winner is chosen from the three.\n\n; Signature Challenge: This challenge is for the amateur bakers to show off their tried-and-tested recipes for bakes they might make for their friends and family.\n; Technical Challenge: This challenge requires enough technical knowledge and experience to produce a certain finished product when given only limited \u2013 or even minimal \u2013 instructions. The bakers are all given the same recipe and are not told beforehand what the challenge will be. The finished products are judged blind and ranked from worst to best.\n; Showstopper Challenge: This challenge is for the bakers to show off their skills and talent. The judges favour a bake that has a professional appearance but is also outstanding in flavours.\n\nIn the first series, the location of the cast and crew moves from town to town each week, but starting from the second series, the competition is held in one location in a specially constructed marquee.

The rounds took place in various locations across the UK, with the final round being held at [[Fulham Palace]], London.\n\nThe three finalists were Ruth Clemens, Miranda Gore Browne, and Edd Kimber.

Several have had a significant impact on what a baker presents, notably:  \n* Presenters [[Mel Giedroyc]] and [[Sue Perkins]] have accidentally interfered with several bakes. In Series 4, Sue leaned on Howard Middleton's [[English Muffins]] in the technical challenge and Series 6, she broke [[Nadiya Hussain]]'s biscuit lid in the showstopper challenge. \n* In Series 2, Robert Billington accidentally dropped his tiered showstopper while applying finishing touches to the cake. Both judges and presenters came to his aid to salvage the bottom tier of his cake. He was able to present the incomplete showstopper as a single-tiered cake.\n* In Series 3, [[John Whaite]] was unable to complete his bake after he suffered a severe cut to his finger on the food processor. He tried to continue working on his strudel wearing a rubber glove, but the bleeding required medical attention, including assistance from Dani, who left her bake to help him.  As a result, John had to abandon the last bake, and no one was eliminated that week.\n* In Series 4, contestant Deborah Manger accidentally used Howard Middleton's custard instead of her own. As a result, Howard was forced to use Deborah's custard, and this was taken into account by the judges, who judged the trifles and custards individually.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.northantstelegraph.co.uk/news/top-stories/deborah-s-desserts-fail-to-impress-on-great-british-bake-off-1-5452839 |title=Deborah's desserts fail to impress on Great British Bake Off |author=Stephanie Weaver |work=Northamptonshire Telegraph |date=4 September 2013 }}</ref>\n* In Series 5, during the [[Baked Alaska]] challenge, Iain Watters's ice cream melted on a very hot day, as did that of several other bakers. He threw his ice cream into the bin in frustration and left the tent. He returned shortly after, and as he had no cake for judging (he produced his bin instead, and the incident was labelled \"[[List of scandals with \"-gate\" suffix#Television|bingate]]\"), he was disqualified from the competition. The event that led to his departure provoked extreme anger from the viewers, who believed the interference of Diana Beard was the reason his ice cream melted.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2014/aug/28/great-british-bake-off-ian-watters-speaks-diana-beard |title=Great British Bake Off: Iain Watters speaks out as Diana Beard quits |author=Hannah Ellis-Petersen |date= 28 August 2014 |work=The Guardian }}</ref>\n*In Series 9, one of contestant Rahul Mandal's empty storage jars burst from the heat within the tent and glass covered the workbench and potentially contaminated the mixtures. The production team had to dispose of all of his mixtures and clear his station. He was then given 15 extra minutes after the other finalists had finished as this was the exact amount of time he had lost. His bake was then judged with equal scrutiny as the others.\n\n==''The Great Christmas/Festive Bake Off''==\nSince 2016, two holiday specials have been transmitted between each series.

Off''''' (often abbreviated to '''''Bake Off''''' or '''''GBBO''''') is a British television [[baking]] competition, produced by [[Love Productions]], in which a group of amateur bakers compete against each other in a series of rounds, attempting to impress a group of judges with their baking skills, with a contestant being eliminated in each round, with the winner being selected from the contestants who reach the finals. The first episode was aired on 17 August 2010, with its first four series broadcast on [[BBC Two]], until its growing popularity led the [[BBC]] to move it to [[BBC One]] for the next three series. After its seventh series, [[Love Productions]] signed a three-year deal with [[Channel 4]] to produce the series for the broadcaster.<ref name=\"Bake Off Move 2\">{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/09/12/bbc-loses-great-british-bake-off/|title=BBC loses Great British Bake Off, as Channel 4 swoops for corporation's biggest show|last=Foster|first=Patrick|date=12 September 2016|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|publisher=[[Telegraph Media Group]]|accessdate=12 September 2016}}</ref> However, [[BBC Studios]] still owns the global distribution rights to the show, which are set for renewal in 2028.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/tv/reality-tv/a807901/bbc-worldwide-still-has-the-international-rights-to-great-british-bake-off-so-there/|title=BBC Worldwide still has the global Bake Off rights|last=Nissim|first=Mayer|date=2016-09-14|website=Digital Spy|language=en-GB|access-date=2019-11-18}}</ref>\n\nThe programme was originally presented by [[Sue Perkins]] and [[Mel Giedroyc]], with judges [[Mary Berry]] and [[Paul Hollywood]].

The contestants are assessed by the judges who then choose a \"[[List of The Great British Bake Off Star Bakers|Star Baker]]\" for the week (introduced in series 2), and a contestant is also eliminated although if the contestant numbers in certain years are not even or there is an non-elimination a week before, then two bakers may be eliminated. In the final round, three bakers are left and a winner is chosen from the three.\n\n; Signature Challenge: This challenge is for the amateur bakers to show off their tried-and-tested recipes for bakes they might make for their friends and family.\n; Technical Challenge: This challenge requires enough technical knowledge and experience to produce a certain finished product when given only limited \u2013 or even minimal \u2013 instructions. The bakers are all given the same recipe and are not told beforehand what the challenge will be. The finished products are judged blind and ranked from worst to best.\n; Showstopper Challenge: This challenge is for the bakers to show off their skills and talent. The judges favour a bake that has a professional appearance but is also outstanding in flavours.\n\nIn the first series, the location of the cast and crew moves from town to town each week, but starting from the second series, the competition is held in one location in a specially constructed marquee. Interspersed in the programme are the background of the contestants as well as video vignettes on the history of baking. What each baker intends to bake during a particular challenge is illustrated using animated graphics. These graphics have been created by illustrator Tom Hovey since the show's inception in 2010.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.itsnicethat.com/articles/illustration-tom-hovey |title=Illustration: We interview the artist behind the Great British Bake Off, Tom Hovey|author= Liv Siddall |date=1 November 2013 |work=It's Nice That }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tomhovey.co.uk/the-great-british-bake-off/ |title=Tom Hovey }}</ref>\n\n== Series overview ==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"  style=\"text-align:center; line-height:16px;\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Series\n! scope=\"col\" | Episodes\n! scope=\"col\" | Premiere\n! scope=\"col\" | Finale\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"background:gold;\"|Winner\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"background:silver;\"|Runners-up\n! scope=\"col\"  |Average UK viewers<br />(millions)<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/10379873/The-Great-British-Bake-Off-moves-to-BBC1.html |title=The Great British Bake Off moves to BBC1 |author=Rachel Moss|date= 15 October 2013|work=Daily Telegraph }}</ref><ref name=\"broadcast\">{{cite news |url=http://www.broadcastnow.co.uk/ratings/bbc1-rises-to-the-challenge/5082034.article |title=BBC1 rises to the challenge|date=22 January 2015 |author= Stephen Price |work=Broadcast }}</ref>\n! scope=\"col\" | Timeslot\n! scope=\"col\" | Channel\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"2\" | [[The Great British Bake Off (series 1)|1]]\n| rowspan=\"2\" | 6\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:left;\"| 17 August 2010\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:left;\"| 21 September 2010\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[Edd Kimber]]\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| Miranda Gore Browne\n| rowspan=\"2\"| 2.77\n| rowspan=\"8\"| Tuesday<br />8:00{{nbsp}}pm\n| rowspan=\"8\"| [[BBC Two]]\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| Ruth Clemens\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"2\" | [[The Great British Bake Off (series 2)|2]]\n| rowspan=\"2\" | 8\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:left;\"| 14 August 2011\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:left;\"| 4 October 2011\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[Joanne Wheatley]]\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| Holly Bell\n| rowspan=\"2\"  | 4.00\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| Mary-Anne Boermans\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"2\" | [[The Great British Bake Off (series 3)|3]]\n| rowspan=\"2\" | 10\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:left;\"| 14 August 2012\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:left;\"| 16 October 2012\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[John Whaite]]\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| Brendan Lynch\n| rowspan=\"2\"  | 5.00\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[James Morton (baker)|James Morton]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"2\" | [[The Great British Bake Off (series 4)|4]]\n| rowspan=\"2\" | 10\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:left;\"| 20 August 2013\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:left;\"| 22 October 2013\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[Frances Quinn]]\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| Kimberley Wilson\n| rowspan=\"2\"  | 7.35\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[Ruby Tandoh]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"2\" | [[The Great British Bake Off (series 5)|5]]\n| rowspan=\"2\" | 10\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:left;\"| 6 August 2014\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:left;\"| 8 October 2014\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[Nancy Birtwhistle]]\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| Luis Troyano\n| rowspan=\"2\" | 10.04\n| rowspan=\"6\" | Wednesday<br />8:00{{nbsp}}pm\n| rowspan=\"6\" | [[BBC One]]\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| Richard Burr\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"2\" | [[The Great British Bake Off (series 6)|6]]\n| rowspan=\"2\" | 10\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:left;\"| 5 August 2015\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:left;\"| 7 October 2015\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[Nadiya Hussain]]\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| Ian Cumming\n| rowspan=\"2\" | 12.50\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[Tamal Ray]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"2\" | [[The Great British Bake Off (series 7)|7]]\n| rowspan=\"2\" | 10\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:left;\"| 24 August 2016\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:left;\"| 26 October 2016\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[Candice Brown]]\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[Andrew M.

The rounds took place in various locations across the UK, with the final round being held at [[Fulham Palace]], London.\n\nThe three finalists were Ruth Clemens, Miranda Gore Browne, and Edd Kimber.

Several have had a significant impact on what a baker presents, notably:  \n* Presenters [[Mel Giedroyc]] and [[Sue Perkins]] have accidentally interfered with several bakes. In Series 4, Sue leaned on Howard Middleton's [[English Muffins]] in the technical challenge and Series 6, she broke [[Nadiya Hussain]]'s biscuit lid in the showstopper challenge. \n* In Series 2, Robert Billington accidentally dropped his tiered showstopper while applying finishing touches to the cake. Both judges and presenters came to his aid to salvage the bottom tier of his cake. He was able to present the incomplete showstopper as a single-tiered cake.\n* In Series 3, [[John Whaite]] was unable to complete his bake after he suffered a severe cut to his finger on the food processor. He tried to continue working on his strudel wearing a rubber glove, but the bleeding required medical attention, including assistance from Dani, who left her bake to help him.  As a result, John had to abandon the last bake, and no one was eliminated that week.\n* In Series 4, contestant Deborah Manger accidentally used Howard Middleton's custard instead of her own. As a result, Howard was forced to use Deborah's custard, and this was taken into account by the judges, who judged the trifles and custards individually.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.northantstelegraph.co.uk/news/top-stories/deborah-s-desserts-fail-to-impress-on-great-british-bake-off-1-5452839 |title=Deborah's desserts fail to impress on Great British Bake Off |author=Stephanie Weaver |work=Northamptonshire Telegraph |date=4 September 2013 }}</ref>\n* In Series 5, during the [[Baked Alaska]] challenge, Iain Watters's ice cream melted on a very hot day, as did that of several other bakers. He threw his ice cream into the bin in frustration and left the tent. He returned shortly after, and as he had no cake for judging (he produced his bin instead, and the incident was labelled \"[[List of scandals with \"-gate\" suffix#Television|bingate]]\"), he was disqualified from the competition. The event that led to his departure provoked extreme anger from the viewers, who believed the interference of Diana Beard was the reason his ice cream melted.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2014/aug/28/great-british-bake-off-ian-watters-speaks-diana-beard |title=Great British Bake Off: Iain Watters speaks out as Diana Beard quits |author=Hannah Ellis-Petersen |date= 28 August 2014 |work=The Guardian }}</ref>\n*In Series 9, one of contestant Rahul Mandal's empty storage jars burst from the heat within the tent and glass covered the workbench and potentially contaminated the mixtures. The production team had to dispose of all of his mixtures and clear his station. He was then given 15 extra minutes after the other finalists had finished as this was the exact amount of time he had lost. His bake was then judged with equal scrutiny as the others.\n\n==''The Great Christmas/Festive Bake Off''==\nSince 2016, two holiday specials have been transmitted between each series.

The Scandinavian variants are also known as ''futhark'' or ''fu\u00feark'' (derived from their first six letters of the alphabet: ''[[Feoh|F]]'', ''[[Ur (rune)|U]]'', ''[[Thurisaz|\u00de]]'', ''[[Ansuz (rune)|A]]'', ''[[Raido|R]]'', and ''[[Kaunan|K]]''); the [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] variant is ''[[Anglo-Saxon runes|futhorc]]'' or ''{{lang|ang|fu\u00feorc}}'' (due to sound-changes undergone in [[Old English]] by the names of those six letters).\n\n[[Runology]] is the study of the runic alphabets, [[runic inscriptions]], [[runestones]], and their history. Runology forms a specialised branch of [[Germanic linguistics]].\n\nThe earliest runic inscriptions date from around 150 AD. The characters were generally replaced by the [[Latin alphabet]] as the cultures that had used runes underwent [[Christianisation]], by approximately 700 AD in central Europe and 1100 AD in [[northern Europe]]. However, the use of runes persisted for specialized purposes in northern Europe. Until the early 20th century, runes were used in rural [[Sweden]] for decorative purposes in [[Dalarna]] and on [[Runic calendar]]s.\n\nThe three best-known runic alphabets are the [[Elder Futhark]] (around 150\u2013800 AD), the [[Anglo-Saxon runes|Anglo-Saxon Futhorc]] (400\u20131100 AD), and the [[Younger Futhark]] (800\u20131100 AD). The Younger Futhark is divided further into the long-branch runes (also called ''Danish'', although they were also used in [[Norway]], [[Sweden]], and [[Frisia]]); short-branch or [[R\u00f6k Runestone|R\u00f6k runes]] (also called ''Swedish-Norwegian'', although they were also used in [[Denmark]]); and the ''{{lang|sv|stavl\u00f6sa}}'' or H\u00e4lsinge runes ([[staveless runes]]). The Younger Futhark developed further into the [[Medieval runes]] (1100\u20131500 AD), and the [[Dalecarlian runes]] ({{circa}} 1500\u20131800 AD).\n\nHistorically, the runic alphabet is a derivation of the [[Old Italic script]]s of antiquity, with the addition of some innovations. Which variant of the Old Italic branch in particular gave rise to the runes is uncertain. Suggestions include [[Raetic alphabet|Raetic]], [[Old Italic alphabet#Venetic alphabet|Venetic]], [[Etruscan alphabet|Etruscan]], or [[History of the Latin alphabet|Old Latin]] as candidates. At the time, all of these scripts had the same angular letter shapes suited for [[epigraphy]], which would become characteristic of the runes.\n\nThe process of transmission of the script is unknown. The oldest inscriptions are found in Denmark and northern Germany. A \"West Germanic hypothesis\" suggests transmission via [[Irminones|Elbe Germanic]] groups, while a \"[[Goths|Gothic]] hypothesis\" presumes transmission via East Germanic [[Chernyakhov culture|expansion]].\n\n==History and use==\n[[Image:R\u00f6kstenen 1.JPG|thumb|An inscription using [[cipher runes]], the [[Elder Futhark]], and the [[Younger Futhark]], on the 9th-century [[R\u00f6k Runestone]] in Sweden]]\n[[Image:Vaksalastenen.jpg|thumb|A Younger Futhark inscription on the 12th-century [[Vaksala Runestone]] in Sweden]]\nThe runes were in use among the [[Germanic tribes|Germanic peoples]] from the 1st or 2nd century AD.{{Refn | group = \"lower-alpha\" | The oldest known runic inscription dates to around AD 150 and is found on a comb discovered in the bog of [[Vimose]], [[Funen]], [[Denmark]].{{Sfn | Stoklund | 2003 | p  = 173}} The inscription reads {{lang|de|harja}}; a disputed candidate for a 1st-century inscription is on the [[Meldorf fibula]] in southern [[Jutland]].}}  This period corresponds to the late [[Common Germanic]] stage linguistically, with a continuum of dialects not yet clearly separated into the three branches of later centuries: [[North Germanic languages|North Germanic]], [[West Germanic languages|West Germanic]], and [[East Germanic languages|East Germanic]].\n\nNo distinction is made in surviving runic inscriptions between long and short vowels, although such a distinction was certainly present phonologically in the spoken languages of the time. Similarly, there are no signs for [[labialized velar consonant|labiovelars]] in the Elder Futhark (such signs were introduced in both the [[Anglo-Saxon runes|Anglo-Saxon futhorc]] and the [[Gothic alphabet]] as variants of ''p''; see {{lang|ang|[[peor\u00f0]]}}.)\n\nThe term ''runes'' is used to distinguish these symbols from Latin and Greek ''letters''. It is attested on a 6th-century [[Alamanni]]c runestaff as {{lang|goh|runa}} and possibly as {{lang|goh|runo}} on the 4th-century [[Einang stone]]. The name comes from the Germanic root {{lang|gem|run-}} ({{lang-got|\ud800\udf42\ud800\udf3f\ud800\udf3d\ud800\udf30}}, {{lang|got-Latn|runa}}), meaning \"secret\" or \"whisper\". In [[Old Irish|Old Irish Gaelic]], the word {{lang|sga|r\u00fan}} means \"mystery\", \"secret\", \"intention\" or \"affectionate love.\" Similarly in [[Welsh language|Welsh]] and [[Old English]], the word {{lang|cy|rhin}} and {{lang|ang|r\u016bn}} respectively means \"mystery\", \"secret\", \"secret writing\", or sometimes in the extreme sense of the word, \"miracle\" ({{lang|cy|gwyrth}}). [[Ogham]] is an older Celtic script from Ireland and Britain, similarly carved in to stone or wood. The root {{lang|bat|run-}} can also be found in the [[Baltic languages]], meaning \"speech\". In [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]], {{lang|lt|runoti}} means both \"to cut (with a knife)\" and \"to speak\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lkz.lt/en/dze.htm |title=Dictionary of the Lithuanian Language |publisher=LKZ |accessdate=2010-04-13 }}</ref> According to another theory, the Germanic root comes from the [[Proto-Indo-European language|Indo-European]] root *''{{PIE|reu\u0259-}}'' \"dig\".<ref>Friedrich Kluge, Etymologisches W\u00f6rterbuch der deutschen Sprache.

Nykysuomen etymologinen sanakirja</ref>\n\n===Origins===\n{{Main article |Elder Futhark}}\nThe runes developed centuries after the [[Old Italic alphabets]] from which they are probably historically derived.\nThe debate on the development of the runic script concerns the question regarding which of the Italic alphabets should be taken as their point of origin and which, if any, signs should be considered original innovations added to the letters found in the Italic scripts. The historical context of the script's origin is the cultural contact between Germanic people, who often served as [[mercenary|mercenaries]] in the [[Roman auxiliaries|Roman army]], and the Italian peninsula during the [[Roman Empire|Roman imperial period]] (1st century BC to 5th century AD).{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} The formation of the Elder Futhark was complete by the early 5th century, with the [[Kylver Stone]] being the first evidence of the ''futhark'' ordering as well as of the ''p'' rune.\n\n[[Image:Venetic Raetic Camunic Lepontic alphabets.png|thumb|upright 1.3|The alphabets of Este (Venetic), Magr\u00e8 and Bolzano/Bozen-Sanzeno (Raetic), Sondrio (Camunic), Lugano (Lepontic)]]\nSpecifically, the [[Old Italic script#Raetic alphabets|Raetic alphabet]] of [[Bolzano]] is often advanced as a candidate for the origin of the runes, with only five Elder Futhark runes ({{script|Runr|\u16d6}} ''e'', {{script|Runr|\u16c7}} ''\u00ef'', {{script|Runr|\u16c3}} ''j'', {{script|Runr|\u16dc}} ''\u014b'', {{script|Runr|\u16c8}} ''p'') having no counterpart in the Bolzano alphabet.{{Sfn | Mees | 2000}} Scandinavian scholars tend to favor derivation from the [[Latin alphabet]] itself over Raetic candidates.{{Sfn | Odenstedt | 1990}}{{Sfn | Williams | 1996}}<ref>{{Citation |url=http://ariadne.uio.no/runenews/odmarune.htm |publisher=Oxford University Press |title=Dictionary of the Middle Ages |type=under preparation |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070623082749/http://ariadne.uio.no/runenews/odmarune.htm |archivedate=2007-06-23 }}.</ref> A \"North Etruscan\" thesis is supported by the inscription on the [[Negau helmet]] dating to the 2nd century BC.{{Sfn|Markey|2001}} This is in a northern Etruscan alphabet but features a Germanic name, {{Lang|gem|Harigast}}. Giuliano and Larissa Bonfante suggest that runes derived from some North Italic alphabet, specifically [[Old Italic alphabet#Venetic alphabet|Venetic]]: but since [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] conquered [[Veneto]] after 200 BC, and then the [[Latin alphabet]] became prominent and [[Adriatic Veneti|Venetic]] culture diminished in importance, [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] people could have adopted the Venetic alphabet within the 3rd century BC or even earlier.<ref>[https://books.google.it/books?id=VWGN6e5Rzf8C&pg=PA119&lpg=PA119&dq=runes+from+venetic+alphabet&source=bl&ots=OeW0SOpgNo&sig=MPh3Dia9tqPSdKyLUiADT3dGguI&hl=it&sa=X&ei=pBSIVYTzNanNygPEiL8o&ved=0CDwQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&q=runes%20from%20venetic%20alphabet&f=false G. Bonfante, L. Bonfante, The Etruscan Language p. 119]</ref>\n\nThe angular shapes of the runes are shared with most contemporary alphabets of the period that were used for carving in wood or stone. There are no ''horizontal'' strokes: when carving a message on a flat staff or stick, it would be along the grain, thus both less legible and more likely to split the wood. This characteristic is also shared by other alphabets, such as the early form of the [[Latin alphabet]] used for the [[Duenos inscription]], but it is not universal, especially among early runic inscriptions, which frequently have variant rune shapes, including horizontal strokes. Runic manuscripts (that is ''written'' rather than carved runes, such as {{lang|la|[[Codex Runicus]]}}) also show horizontal strokes.\n\nThe \"[[West Germanic languages|West Germanic]] hypothesis\" speculates on an introduction by [[West Germanic tribes]]. This hypothesis is based on claiming that the earliest inscriptions of the 2nd and 3rd centuries, found in bogs and graves around [[Jutland]] (the [[Vimose inscriptions]]), exhibit word endings that, being interpreted by [[Scandinavia]]n scholars to be [[Proto-Norse]], are considered unresolved and long having been the subject of discussion. Inscriptions such as {{lang|gem|wagnija}}, {{lang|gem|ni\u00feijo}}, and {{lang|gem|harija}} are supposed to represent tribe names, tentatively proposed to be [[Vangiones]], the [[Nidensis]], and the [[Harii]] tribes located in the [[Rhineland]].{{Sfn | Looijenga | 1997}} Since names ending in {{lang|gem|-io}} reflect Germanic morphology representing the Latin ending {{lang|la|-ius}}, and the suffix {{lang|la|-inius}} was reflected by Germanic {{lang|gem|-inio-}},{{Sfn | Weisgerber | 1968 |pp=135, 392ff }}{{Sfn | Weisgerber | 1966\u20131967 | p = 207}} the question of the problematic ending {{lang|gem|-ijo}} in masculine Proto-Norse would be resolved by assuming Roman (Rhineland) influences, while \"the awkward ending -a of {{lang|gem|lagu\u00feewa}}{{Sfn | Syrett | 1994 | pp= 44ff}} may be solved by accepting the fact that the name may indeed be West Germanic\".{{Sfn | Looijenga | 1997}} In the early Runic period differences between Germanic languages are generally presumed to be small. Another theory presumes a [[Northwest Germanic]] unity preceding the emergence of Proto-Norse proper from roughly the 5th century.{{Refn |group=\"lower-alpha\" | {{Harvnb | Penzl | Hall | 1994a}} assume a period of \"Proto-Nordic-Westgermanic\" unity down to the 5th century and the [[Gallehus horns]] inscription.{{Sfn | Penzl | Hall | 1994b |p=186}}}}{{Refn |group=\"lower-alpha\" | The division between Northwest Germanic and Proto-Norse is somewhat arbitrary.{{Sfn | Antonsen | 1965 | p=36}}}} An alternative suggestion explaining the impossibility of classifying the earliest inscriptions as either North or West Germanic is forwarded by \u00c8. A. Makaev, who presumes a \"special runic [[koine]]\", an early \"literary Germanic\" employed by the entire Late Common Germanic linguistic community after the separation of Gothic (2nd to 5th centuries), while the spoken dialects may already have been more diverse.{{Sfn | Antonsen | 1965 |p=36}}\n\n===Early inscriptions===\n[[File:Pietroassa ring 1875.jpg|thumb|right|[[Ring of Pietroassa]] ({{circa|250\u2013400 AD}}) by Henri Trenk, 1875]]\nRunic inscriptions from the 400-year period 150\u2013550 AD are described as \"Period I\". These inscriptions are generally in [[Elder Futhark]], but the set of letter shapes and [[bindrune]]s employed is far from standardized. Notably the ''[[j\u0113ran|j]]'', ''[[sowilo rune|s]]'', and ''[[\u16dc|\u014b]]'' runes undergo considerable modifications, while others, such as ''[[\u16c8|p]]'' and ''[[\u16c7|\u00ef]]'', remain unattested altogether prior to the first full futhark row on the [[Kylver Stone]] ({{circa}} 400 AD).\n\nArtifacts such as spear heads or shield mounts have been found that bear runic marking that may be dated to 200 AD, as evidenced by artifacts found across northern Europe in Schleswig (North Germany), Fyn, Sj\u00e6lland, Jylland (Denmark), and Sk\u00e5ne (Sweden). Earlier\u2014but less reliable\u2014artifacts have been found in [[Meldorf]], S\u00fcderdithmarschen, northern Germany; these include brooches and combs found in graves, most notably the [[Meldorf fibula]], and are supposed to have the earliest markings resembling runic inscriptions.\n\nTheories of the existence of separate [[Gothic language|Gothic]] runes have been advanced, even identifying them as the original alphabet from which the Futhark were derived, but these have little support in archaeological findings (mainly the [[spearhead of Kovel]], with its right-to-left inscription, its T-shaped [[tiwaz rune|tiwaz]], and its rectangular [[dagaz]]). If there ever were genuinely Gothic runes, they were soon replaced by the [[Gothic alphabet]]. The letters of the Gothic alphabet, however, as given by the [[Alcuin]] manuscript (9th century), are obviously related to the names of the Futhark. The names are clearly Gothic, but it is impossible to say whether they are as old as the letters themselves. A handful of Elder Futhark inscriptions were found in Gothic territory, such as the 3rd- to 5th-century [[Ring of Pietroassa]].\n\nThe ''[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]'' even suggests the original development of the runes may have been due to the Goths.<ref>{{Citation |quote=A likely theory is that the runic alphabet was developed by the Goths, a Germanic people, from the Etruscan alphabet of northern Italy and was perhaps also influenced by the Latin alphabet in the 1st or 2nd century BC |title=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica |contribution-url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/512796/runic-alphabet |contribution=Runic alphabet|title-link=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica }}.</ref>\n\n===Magical or divinatory use===\n[[File:Brakteat von Djupbrunns.jpg|thumb|right|A [[bracteate]] ([[Alu (runic)#G 205|G 205]]) from approximately AD 400 that features the charm word {{lang|non|[[alu (runic)|alu]]}} with a depiction of a stylized male head, a horse, and a [[swastika]], a common motif on bracteates]]\n[[File:Gummarpstenen.gif|thumb|An illustration of the [[Gummarp Runestone]] (500\u2013700 AD) from [[Blekinge]], Sweden]]\n[[File:Bj\u00f6rketorpsstenen runor.jpg|right|thumb|Closeup of the runic inscription found on the 6th- or 7th-century [[Bj\u00f6rketorp Runestone]] located in [[Blekinge]], Sweden]]\n{{Main|Runic magic}}\nThe stanza 157 of {{lang|non|[[H\u00e1vam\u00e1l]]}} attribute to runes the power to bring that which is dead back to life.

Due to this, it is possible that the early runes were not used so much as a simple writing system, but rather as [[magic (paranormal)|magical]] signs to be used for charms. Although some say the runes were used for [[divination]], there is no direct evidence to suggest they were ever used in this way. The name ''rune'' itself, taken to mean \"secret, something hidden\", seems to indicate that knowledge of the runes was originally considered esoteric, or restricted to an elite. The 6th-century [[Bj\u00f6rketorp Runestone]] warns in [[Proto-Norse language|Proto-Norse]] using the word ''rune'' in both senses:\n{{Quote |{{lang|non|Haidzruno runu, falahak haidera, ginnarunaz.

There also are some inscriptions suggesting a medieval belief in the magical significance of runes, such as the [[Franks Casket]] (AD 700) panel.\n\nCharm words, such as {{lang|non|auja}}, {{lang|non|la\u00feu}}, {{lang|non|lauka\u0280}}, and most commonly, {{lang|non|[[alu (runic)|alu]]}},{{Sfn|MacLeod|Mees|2006|pp=100\u201301}} appear on a number of [[Migration period]] Elder Futhark inscriptions as well as variants and abbreviations of them. Much speculation and study has been produced on the potential meaning of these inscriptions. Rhyming groups appear on some early bracteates that also may be magical in purpose, such as {{lang|non|salusalu}} and {{lang|non|luwatuwa}}. Further, an inscription on the [[Gummarp Runestone]] (500\u2013700 AD) gives a cryptic inscription describing the use of three runic letters followed by the Elder Futhark f-rune written three times in succession.{{Sfn|Page|2005 |p=31}}\n\nNevertheless, it has proven difficult to find unambiguous traces of runic \"oracles\": although [[Old Norse language|Norse]] literature is full of references to runes, it nowhere contains specific instructions on divination.  There are at least three sources on divination with rather vague descriptions that may, or may not, refer to runes: [[Tacitus]]'s 1st-century {{lang|la|[[Germania (book)|Germania]]}}, [[Snorri Sturluson]]'s 13th-century {{lang|non|[[Ynglinga saga]]}}, and [[Rimbert]]'s 9th-century {{lang|la|[[Vita Ansgari]]}}.\n\nThe first source, Tacitus's {{lang|la|Germania}}, describes \"signs\" chosen in groups of three and cut from \"a nut-bearing tree\", although the runes do not seem to have been in use at the time of Tacitus' writings.  A second source is the {{lang|non|Ynglinga saga}}, where [[Granmar]], the king of {{lang|sv|[[S\u00f6dermanland]]|italic=no}}, goes to [[Gamla Uppsala|Uppsala]] for the {{lang|non|[[bl\u00f3t]]|italic=no}}. There, the \"chips\" fell in a way that said that he would not live long ({{lang|non|F\u00e9ll honum \u00fe\u00e1 svo sp\u00e1nn sem hann mundi eigi lengi lifa}}). These \"chips\", however, are easily explainable as a {{lang|non|bl\u00f3tsp\u00e1nn}} (sacrificial chip), which was \"marked, possibly with sacrificial blood, shaken, and thrown down like dice, and their positive or negative significance then decided.\"{{Sfn|Foote|Wilson|1970}}{{Rp |needed=yes |date=March 2013 }}\n\nThe third source is Rimbert's {{lang|la|Vita Ansgari}}, where there are three accounts of what some believe to be the use of runes for divination, but Rimbert calls it \"drawing lots\". One of these accounts is the description of how a renegade Swedish king, [[Anund Uppsale]], first brings a Danish fleet to [[Birka]], but then changes his mind and asks the Danes to \"draw lots\". According to the story, this \"drawing of lots\" was quite informative, telling them that attacking [[Birka]] would bring bad luck and that they should attack a Slavic town instead.  The tool in the \"drawing of lots\", however, is easily explainable as a {{lang|non|hlautlein}} (lot-twig), which according to Foote and Wilson{{Sfn|Foote|Wilson|1970|p=401}} would be used in the same manner as a {{lang|non|bl\u00f3tsp\u00e1nn}}.\n\nThe lack of extensive knowledge on historical use of the runes has not stopped modern authors from extrapolating entire systems of divination from what few specifics exist, usually loosely based on the reconstructed names of the runes and additional outside influence.\n\nA recent study of runic magic suggests that runes were used to create magical objects such as amulets,{{Sfn|MacLeod|Mees|2006}}{{Rp |needed=yes |date=March 2013}} but not in a way that would indicate that runic writing was any more inherently magical, than were other writing systems such as Latin or Greek.\n\n===Medieval use===\n[[Image:CodexRunicus.jpeg|thumb|left|[[Codex Runicus]], a [[vellum]] manuscript from approximately 1300 AD containing one of the oldest and best preserved texts of the [[Scanian Law]], is written entirely in runes.]]{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2017}}\nAs [[Proto-Germanic]] evolved into its later language groups, the words assigned to the runes and the sounds represented by the runes themselves began to diverge somewhat and each culture would create new runes, rename or rearrange its rune names slightly, or stop using obsolete runes completely, to accommodate these changes. Thus, the Anglo-Saxon futhorc has several runes peculiar to itself to represent [[diphthong]]s unique to (or at least prevalent in) the Anglo-Saxon dialect.\n\nNevertheless, that the Younger Futhark has 16 runes, while the Elder Futhark has 24, is not fully explained by the 600-some years of sound changes that had occurred in the North Germanic language group.<ref>{{cite book\n|last1       = McDermott\n|first1      = Larissa\n|year        = 2016\n|title       = Runes\n|url         = https://books.google.com/books?id=8h08DAAAQBAJ&pg=PA70&dq=%22Elder+Futhark+contains+a+total+of%22\n|publisher   = [[Lulu.com|Lulu Press]]\n|page        = 70\n|access-date = 2018-05-22\n|isbn      = 9781365130724\n}}</ref>{{sps|date=February 2020}} The development here might seem rather astonishing, since the younger form of the alphabet came to use fewer different rune signs at the same time as the development of the language led to a greater number of different phonemes than had been present at the time of the older futhark. For example, voiced and unvoiced consonants merged in script, and so did many vowels, while the number of vowels in the spoken language increased. From {{circa}} 1100 AD, this disadvantage was eliminated in the medieval runes, which again increased the number of different signs to correspond with the number of phonemes in the language.\n\nSome later runic finds are on monuments ([[runestone]]s), which often contain solemn inscriptions about people who died or performed great deeds. For a long time it was presumed that this kind of grand inscription was the primary use of runes, and that their use was associated with a certain societal class of rune carvers.\n\nIn the mid-1950s, however, approximately 670 inscriptions, known as the [[Bryggen inscriptions]], were found in [[Bergen, Norway|Bergen]].<ref>{{cite book\n|last1       = William\n|first1      = Gareth\n|year        = 2007\n|title       = West over Sea: Studies in Scandinavian Sea-Borne Expansion and Settlement Before 1300\n|url         = https://books.google.com/books?id=U-2vCQAAQBAJ&pg=PA473&dq=%22rune-inscribed+sticks+from+bryggen%22\n|publisher   = [[Brill Publishers]]\n|page        = 473\n|access-date = 2018-05-22\n|isbn      = 9789047421214\n}}</ref> These inscriptions were made on wood and bone, often in the shape of sticks of various sizes, and contained inscriptions of an everyday nature\u2014ranging from name tags, prayers (often in [[Latin]]), personal messages, business letters, and expressions of affection, to bawdy phrases of a profane and sometimes even of a vulgar nature. Following this find, it is nowadays commonly presumed that, at least in late use, Runic was a widespread and common writing system.\n\n[[File:BM-ClogAlmanac.JPG|right|thumb|17th-century clog almanac collected by Sir Hans Sloane. Now in the collection of the British Museum]]\nIn the later Middle Ages, runes also were used in the [[runic calendar|clog almanacs]] (sometimes called ''Runic staff'', ''Prim'', or ''Scandinavian calendar'') of Sweden and [[Estonia]]. The authenticity of some monuments bearing Runic inscriptions found in Northern America is disputed; most of them have been dated to modern times.\n\n===Runes in Eddic lore===\nIn [[Norse mythology]], the runic alphabet is attested to a divine origin ({{lang-non|reginkunnr}}).

These sons became the ancestors of the three classes of humans indicated by their names. When Jarl reached an age when he began to handle weapons and show other signs of nobility, {{lang|non|R\u00edg|italic=no}} returned and, having claimed him as a son, taught him the runes. In 1555, the exiled Swedish archbishop {{lang|non|[[Olaus Magnus]]|italic=no}} recorded a tradition that a man named {{lang|non|[[Kettil Runske]]|italic=no}} had stolen three rune staffs from Odin and learned the runes and their magic.\n\n==Runic alphabets==\n\n=== Elder Futhark (2nd to 8th centuries) ===\n[[Image:Inscription on Golden horn of Gallehus.jpg|thumb|right|Detail of the Elder Futhark inscription on a replica of one of the 5th-century AD [[Golden Horns of Gallehus]] found on [[Jutland]], now Denmark]]\n{{Main article |Elder Futhark}}\nThe Elder Futhark, used for writing [[Proto-Norse]], consists of 24 runes that often are arranged in three groups of eight; each group is referred to as an [[Norse clans#Runology|\u00c6tt]]. The earliest known sequential listing of the full set of 24 runes dates to approximately AD 400 and is found on the [[Kylver Stone]] in [[Gotland]], Sweden.\n\nMost probably each rune had a name, chosen to represent the sound of the rune itself. The names are, however, not directly attested for the Elder Futhark themselves. [[Linguistic reconstruction|Reconstructed]] names in [[Proto-Germanic]] have been produced,{{by whom|date=July 2016}} based on the names given for the runes in the later alphabets attested in the [[rune poem]]s and the linked names of the letters of the [[Gothic alphabet]]. The letter /a/ was named from the runic [[Alphabet|letter]] [[Image:Runic letter ansuz.svg|20x16px]] called [[Ansuz (rune)|Ansuz]].

It was probably used from the 5th century onwards. There are competing theories as to the origins of the Anglo-Saxon Futhorc. One theory proposes that it was developed in [[Frisia]] and later spread to [[England]],{{citation needed|date=November 2016}} while another holds that Scandinavians introduced runes to England, where the futhorc was modified and exported to Frisia.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}} Some examples of futhorc inscriptions are found on the [[Thames scramasax]], in the [[Vienna Codex (Anglo-Saxon)|Vienna Codex]], in [[Cotton Otho]] B.x ([[Anglo-Saxon rune poem]]) and on the [[Ruthwell Cross]].\n\nThe Anglo-Saxon rune poem gives the following characters and names: {{script|Runr|\u16a0}} feoh, {{script|Runr|\u16a2}} ur, {{script|Runr|\u16a6}} \u00feorn, {{script|Runr |\u16a9}} os, {{script|Runr|\u16b1}} rad, {{script|Runr|\u16b3}} cen, {{script|Runr|\u16b7}} gyfu, {{script|Runr|\u16b9}} \u01bfynn, {{script|Runr|\u16bb}} h\u00e6gl, {{script|Runr|\u16be}} nyd, {{script|Runr |\u16c1}} is, {{script|Runr|\u16c4}} ger, {{script|Runr |\u16c7}} eoh, {{script|Runr |\u16c8}} peor\u00f0, {{script|Runr|\u16c9}} eolh, {{script|Runr|\u16cb}} sigel, {{script|Runr|\u16cf}} tir, {{script|Runr|\u16d2}} beorc, {{script|Runr|\u16d6}} eh, {{script|Runr|\u16d7}} mann, {{script|Runr|\u16da}} lagu, {{script|Runr|\u16dd}} ing, {{script|Runr|\u16df}} \u0153thel, {{script|Runr|\u16de}} d\u00e6g, {{script|Runr|\u16aa}} ac, {{script|Runr|\u16ab}} \u00e6sc, {{script|Runr|\u16a3}} yr, {{script|Runr|\u16e1}} ior, {{script|Runr|\u16e0}} ear.\n\nExtra runes attested to outside of the rune poem include {{script|Runr|\u16e2}} cweor\u00f0, {{script|Runr|\u16e3}} calc, {{script|Runr|\u16b8}} gar, and {{script|Runr|\u16e5}} stan. Some of these additional letters have only been found in [[Pseudo-runes|manuscripts]]. Feoh, \u00feorn, and sigel stood for [f], [\u00fe], and [s] in most environments, but voiced to [v], [\u00f0], and [z] between vowels or voiced consonants.

The manuscript text attributes the runes to the ''Marcomanni, quos nos Nordmannos vocamus'', and hence traditionally, the alphabet is called \"Marcomannic runes\", but it has no connection with the [[Marcomanni]], and rather is an attempt of Carolingian scholars to represent all letters of the Latin alphabets with runic equivalents.\n\n[[Wilhelm Grimm]] discussed these runes in 1821.<ref>{{Citation | last = Grimm | first = William | year = 1821 | author-link = Wilhelm Grimm | title = Ueber deutsche Runen |trans-title=Concerning German runes | language = German | chapter = 18 | pages = 149\u201359}}.</ref>\n\n===Younger Futhark (9th to 11th centuries)===\n{{Main article |Younger Futhark}}\n[[Image:Yngre futharken.svg|thumb|280px|The [[Younger Futhark]]: long-branch runes and short-twig runes]]\n[[Image:Sigurd.svg|left|thumb|While also featuring a runic inscription detailing the erection of a bridge for a loved one, the 11th-century [[Sigurd stones#S\u00f6 101|Ramsung carving]] is a [[Sigurd stones|Sigurd stone]] that depicts the legend of [[Sigurd]].]]\nThe Younger Futhark, also called Scandinavian Futhark, is a reduced form of the [[Elder Futhark]], consisting of only 16 characters. The reduction correlates with phonetic changes when [[Proto-Norse]] evolved into [[Old Norse language|Old Norse]]. They are found in Scandinavia and [[Viking Age]] settlements abroad, probably in use from the 9th century onward. They are divided into long-branch (Danish) and short-twig (Swedish and Norwegian) runes.  The difference between the two versions is a matter of controversy. A general opinion is that the difference between them was functional (viz., the long-branch runes were used for documentation on stone, whereas the short-twig runes were in everyday use for private or official messages on wood).\n\n===Medieval runes  (12th to 15th centuries)===\n{{Main article |Medieval runes}}\n[[Image:Medeltida runor.svg|410px|right|thumb|[[Medieval runes]] ]]\n[[Image:Saleby kyrkklocka, V\u00e4sterg\u00f6tland.png|left|thumb|A church bell from Saleby, [[V\u00e4sterg\u00f6tland]], Sweden, containing a runic inscription from 1228 AD]]\nIn the Middle Ages, the Younger Futhark in Scandinavia was expanded, so that it once more contained one sign for each phoneme of the [[Old Norse language]]. Dotted variants of [[voiceless]] signs were introduced to denote the corresponding [[voiced]] consonants, or vice versa, voiceless variants of voiced consonants, and several new runes also appeared for vowel sounds. Inscriptions in medieval Scandinavian runes show a large number of variant rune forms, and some letters, such as ''s'', ''c'', and ''z'' often were used interchangeably.{{Sfn | Jacobsen | Moltke | 1942 | p = vii}}{{Sfn | Werner | 2004 | p = 20}}\n\nMedieval runes were in use until the 15th century. Of the total number of Norwegian runic inscriptions preserved today, most are medieval runes.  Notably, more than 600 inscriptions using these runes have been discovered in [[Bergen (Norway)|Bergen]] since the 1950s, mostly on wooden sticks (the so-called [[Bryggen inscriptions]]).

[[Anders Celsius]] (1701\u20131744) further extended the science of runes and travelled around the whole of Sweden to examine the ''runstenar'' ([[runestone]]s).

[[Elder Futhark]] inscriptions number around 350, about 260 of which are from Scandinavia, of which about half are on [[bracteate]]s. [[Anglo-Saxon runes|Anglo-Saxon futhorc]] inscriptions number around 100 items.\n\n==Modern use==\n{{main article|Modern runic writing}}\nRunic alphabets have seen numerous uses since the 18th-century [[Viking revival]], in Scandinavian [[Romantic nationalism]] ([[Gothicismus]]) and [[Germanic occultism]] in the 19th century, and in the context of the [[Fantasy]] genre and of [[Germanic Neopaganism]] in the 20th century.\n\n===Esotericism===\n\n==== Germanic mysticism and Nazi symbolism ====\n{{Further|Runosophy|Armanen runes|Wiligut runes|Runengymnastik}}\n[[File:EBay 025.jpg|thumb|Runic script on an 1886 gravestone in [[Parkend]], [[England]] ]]\n[[Image:Flag Schutzstaffel.svg|thumb|180px|From 1933, [[Schutzstaffel unit insignia]] displayed two [[Sig Rune]]s]]\nThe pioneer of the ''[[Armanist]]'' branch of [[Ariosophy]] and one of the more important figures in [[esotericism in Germany and Austria]] in the late 19th and early 20th century was the [[Austria]]n occultist, mysticist, and [[v\u00f6lkisch]] author, [[Guido von List]]. In 1908, he published in ''[[Das Geheimnis der Runen]]'' (\"The Secret of the Runes\") a set of eighteen so-called, \"[[Armanen runes]]\", based on the Younger Futhark and runes of List's own introduction, which allegedly were revealed to him in a state of temporary blindness after cataract operations on both eyes in 1902.\nThe use of runes in [[Germanic mysticism]], notably List's \"Armanen runes\" and the derived \"[[Wiligut runes]]\" by [[Karl Maria Wiligut]], played a certain role in [[Nazi symbolism]]. The fascination with runic symbolism was mostly limited to [[Heinrich Himmler]], and not shared by the other members of the Nazi top echelon. Consequently, runes appear mostly in insignia associated with the ''[[Schutzstaffel]]'', the paramilitary organization led by Himmler. Wiligut is credited with designing the [[SS-Ehrenring]], which displays a number of \"Wiligut runes\".\n\n====Modern neopaganism and esotericism====\nRunes are popular in [[Germanic neopaganism]], and to a lesser extent in other forms of [[Neopaganism]] and [[New Age]] esotericism. Various systems of [[Runic divination]] have been published since the 1980s, notably by [[Ralph Blum]] (1982), [[Stephen Flowers]] (1984, onward), [[Stephan Grundy]] (1990), and [[Nigel Pennick]] (1995).\n\nThe [[Uthark theory]] originally was proposed as a scholarly hypothesis by [[Sigurd Agrell]] in 1932.\nIn 2002, Swedish esotericist [[Thomas Karlsson]] popularized this \"Uthark\" runic row, which he refers to as, the \"night side of the runes\", in the context of modern occultism.\n\n=== Bluetooth ===\nThe [[Bluetooth]] logo is the combination of two runes of the [[Younger Futhark]], {{runic|\u16bc}} [[Haglaz|''hagall'']] and {{runic|\u16d2}} [[Berkanan|''bjarkan'']], equivalent to the letters \u00abH\u00bb and \u00abB\u00bb, that are the initials of [[Harald Bluetooth|Harald Bl\u00e5tand]]'s name (''bluetooth'' in English), who was a king of Denmark from the [[Viking Age|Viking age]].\n[[File:BluetoothLogo.svg|thumb|224x224px|[[Bluetooth]] logo with the initials of [[Harald Bluetooth|Harald Bl\u00e5tand]].]]\n\n===J. R. R. Tolkien and contemporary fiction===\n{{See also|Cirth#Runes from The Hobbit}}\nIn [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s novel ''[[The Hobbit]]'' (1937), the Anglo-Saxon runes are used on a map to emphasize its connection to the [[Dwarf (Middle-earth)|Dwarves]]. They also were used in the initial drafts of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', but later were replaced by the [[Cirth]] rune-like alphabet invented by Tolkien, used to write the language of the Dwarves, [[Khuzdul]].  Following Tolkien, historical and fictional runes appear commonly in modern popular culture, particularly in [[fantasy literature]], but also in other forms of media such as [[video games]] (for example the 1992 video game ''[[Heimdall (video game)|Heimdall]]'' used it as \"magical symbols\" associated with unnatural forces).\n\n==Unicode==\n{{Main article|Runic (Unicode block)}}\n[[File:Runen Schlagstempel.jpg|thumb|Runic Steel Stamps, Elder Futhark]]\nRunic alphabets were added to the [[Unicode]] Standard in September, 1999 with the release of version 3.0.\n\nThe [[Unicode block]] for Runic alphabets is U+16A0\u2013U+16FF. It is intended to encode the letters of the [[Elder Futhark]], the [[Anglo-Frisian runes]], and the [[Younger Futhark]] long-branch and short-twig (but not the staveless) variants, in cases where cognate letters have the same shape resorting to \"[[Universal Character Set characters|unification]]\".\n\nThe block as of Unicode 3.0 contained 81 symbols: 75 runic letters (U+16A0\u2013U+16EA), 3 punctuation marks (Runic Single Punctuation U+16EB {{script|Runr|\u16eb}}, Runic Multiple Punctuation U+16EC {{script|Runr|\u16ec}} and Runic Cross Punctuation U+16ED {{script|Runr|\u16ed}}), and three runic symbols that are used in early modern [[runic calendar]] staves (\"Golden number Runes\", Runic [[Arlaug]] Symbol U+16EE {{script|Runr|\u16ee}}, Runic [[Tvimadur]] Symbol U+16EF {{script|Runr|\u16ef}}, Runic [[Belgthor]] Symbol U+16F0 {{script|Runr|\u16f0}}). As of Unicode 7.0 (2014), eight characters were added, three attributed to [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s mode of writing Modern English in Anglo-Saxon runes, and five for the \"cryptogrammic\" vowel symbols used in an inscription on the [[Franks Casket]].\n\n{{Unicode chart Runic}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[Bergakker inscription|Runic inscription in the Netherlands]]\n* [[Pentimal system]] of numerals\n* [[Runic magic]]\n* [[Runiform (disambiguation)]] for unrelated scripts sometimes described as \"runes\" or \"rune-like\"\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist | group = \"lower-alpha\"}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n{{Refbegin |2}}\n* {{Citation | first = Elmer H. | last = Antonsen | title = On Defining Stages in Prehistoric Germanic | journal = Language | volume = 41 | issue = 1 | pages = 19\u201336 | year = 1965 | doi = 10.2307/411849 | jstor = 411849 }}.<!--\n* {{Citation | editor1-last = Bammesberger | editor1-first = A | editor2-first = G | editor2-last = Waxenberger | title = Das fu\u00feark und Seine Einzelsprachlichen Weiterentwicklungen | publisher = Walter de Gruyter | year = 2006 | isbn = 3-11-019008-7}}.\n* {{Citation | last = Blum | first = Ralph | year = 1932 | title = The Book of Runes \u2013 A Handbook for the use of Ancient Oracle: The Viking Runes | series = Oracle Books | publisher = St. Martin's Press | place = New York | isbn = 0-312-00729-9}}.\n* {{Citation | author-link = Erik Brate| last = Brate | first = Erik | year = 1922 | title = Sveriges Runinskrifter | url = http://www.runor.se/ | language = Swedish}}.\n* {{Citation | last = D\u00fcwel | first = Klaus | year = 2001 | title = Runenkunde | publisher = JB Metzler | language = German}}. -->\n* {{Citation | last1 = Foote | first1 = P.

The Scandinavian variants are also known as ''futhark'' or ''fu\u00feark'' (derived from their first six letters of the alphabet: ''[[Feoh|F]]'', ''[[Ur (rune)|U]]'', ''[[Thurisaz|\u00de]]'', ''[[Ansuz (rune)|A]]'', ''[[Raido|R]]'', and ''[[Kaunan|K]]''); the [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] variant is ''[[Anglo-Saxon runes|futhorc]]'' or ''{{lang|ang|fu\u00feorc}}'' (due to sound-changes undergone in [[Old English]] by the names of those six letters).\n\n[[Runology]] is the study of the runic alphabets, [[runic inscriptions]], [[runestones]], and their history. Runology forms a specialised branch of [[Germanic linguistics]].\n\nThe earliest runic inscriptions date from around 150 AD. The characters were generally replaced by the [[Latin alphabet]] as the cultures that had used runes underwent [[Christianisation]], by approximately 700 AD in central Europe and 1100 AD in [[northern Europe]]. However, the use of runes persisted for specialized purposes in northern Europe. Until the early 20th century, runes were used in rural [[Sweden]] for decorative purposes in [[Dalarna]] and on [[Runic calendar]]s.\n\nThe three best-known runic alphabets are the [[Elder Futhark]] (around 150\u2013800 AD), the [[Anglo-Saxon runes|Anglo-Saxon Futhorc]] (400\u20131100 AD), and the [[Younger Futhark]] (800\u20131100 AD). The Younger Futhark is divided further into the long-branch runes (also called ''Danish'', although they were also used in [[Norway]], [[Sweden]], and [[Frisia]]); short-branch or [[R\u00f6k Runestone|R\u00f6k runes]] (also called ''Swedish-Norwegian'', although they were also used in [[Denmark]]); and the ''{{lang|sv|stavl\u00f6sa}}'' or H\u00e4lsinge runes ([[staveless runes]]). The Younger Futhark developed further into the [[Medieval runes]] (1100\u20131500 AD), and the [[Dalecarlian runes]] ({{circa}} 1500\u20131800 AD).\n\nHistorically, the runic alphabet is a derivation of the [[Old Italic script]]s of antiquity, with the addition of some innovations. Which variant of the Old Italic branch in particular gave rise to the runes is uncertain. Suggestions include [[Raetic alphabet|Raetic]], [[Old Italic alphabet#Venetic alphabet|Venetic]], [[Etruscan alphabet|Etruscan]], or [[History of the Latin alphabet|Old Latin]] as candidates. At the time, all of these scripts had the same angular letter shapes suited for [[epigraphy]], which would become characteristic of the runes.\n\nThe process of transmission of the script is unknown. The oldest inscriptions are found in Denmark and northern Germany. A \"West Germanic hypothesis\" suggests transmission via [[Irminones|Elbe Germanic]] groups, while a \"[[Goths|Gothic]] hypothesis\" presumes transmission via East Germanic [[Chernyakhov culture|expansion]].\n\n==History and use==\n[[Image:R\u00f6kstenen 1.JPG|thumb|An inscription using [[cipher runes]], the [[Elder Futhark]], and the [[Younger Futhark]], on the 9th-century [[R\u00f6k Runestone]] in Sweden]]\n[[Image:Vaksalastenen.jpg|thumb|A Younger Futhark inscription on the 12th-century [[Vaksala Runestone]] in Sweden]]\nThe runes were in use among the [[Germanic tribes|Germanic peoples]] from the 1st or 2nd century AD.{{Refn | group = \"lower-alpha\" | The oldest known runic inscription dates to around AD 150 and is found on a comb discovered in the bog of [[Vimose]], [[Funen]], [[Denmark]].{{Sfn | Stoklund | 2003 | p  = 173}} The inscription reads {{lang|de|harja}}; a disputed candidate for a 1st-century inscription is on the [[Meldorf fibula]] in southern [[Jutland]].}}  This period corresponds to the late [[Common Germanic]] stage linguistically, with a continuum of dialects not yet clearly separated into the three branches of later centuries: [[North Germanic languages|North Germanic]], [[West Germanic languages|West Germanic]], and [[East Germanic languages|East Germanic]].\n\nNo distinction is made in surviving runic inscriptions between long and short vowels, although such a distinction was certainly present phonologically in the spoken languages of the time. Similarly, there are no signs for [[labialized velar consonant|labiovelars]] in the Elder Futhark (such signs were introduced in both the [[Anglo-Saxon runes|Anglo-Saxon futhorc]] and the [[Gothic alphabet]] as variants of ''p''; see {{lang|ang|[[peor\u00f0]]}}.)\n\nThe term ''runes'' is used to distinguish these symbols from Latin and Greek ''letters''. It is attested on a 6th-century [[Alamanni]]c runestaff as {{lang|goh|runa}} and possibly as {{lang|goh|runo}} on the 4th-century [[Einang stone]]. The name comes from the Germanic root {{lang|gem|run-}} ({{lang-got|\ud800\udf42\ud800\udf3f\ud800\udf3d\ud800\udf30}}, {{lang|got-Latn|runa}}), meaning \"secret\" or \"whisper\". In [[Old Irish|Old Irish Gaelic]], the word {{lang|sga|r\u00fan}} means \"mystery\", \"secret\", \"intention\" or \"affectionate love.\" Similarly in [[Welsh language|Welsh]] and [[Old English]], the word {{lang|cy|rhin}} and {{lang|ang|r\u016bn}} respectively means \"mystery\", \"secret\", \"secret writing\", or sometimes in the extreme sense of the word, \"miracle\" ({{lang|cy|gwyrth}}). [[Ogham]] is an older Celtic script from Ireland and Britain, similarly carved in to stone or wood. The root {{lang|bat|run-}} can also be found in the [[Baltic languages]], meaning \"speech\". In [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]], {{lang|lt|runoti}} means both \"to cut (with a knife)\" and \"to speak\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lkz.lt/en/dze.htm |title=Dictionary of the Lithuanian Language |publisher=LKZ |accessdate=2010-04-13 }}</ref> According to another theory, the Germanic root comes from the [[Proto-Indo-European language|Indo-European]] root *''{{PIE|reu\u0259-}}'' \"dig\".<ref>Friedrich Kluge, Etymologisches W\u00f6rterbuch der deutschen Sprache.

The historical context of the script's origin is the cultural contact between Germanic people, who often served as [[mercenary|mercenaries]] in the [[Roman auxiliaries|Roman army]], and the Italian peninsula during the [[Roman Empire|Roman imperial period]] (1st century BC to 5th century AD).{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} The formation of the Elder Futhark was complete by the early 5th century, with the [[Kylver Stone]] being the first evidence of the ''futhark'' ordering as well as of the ''p'' rune.\n\n[[Image:Venetic Raetic Camunic Lepontic alphabets.png|thumb|upright 1.3|The alphabets of Este (Venetic), Magr\u00e8 and Bolzano/Bozen-Sanzeno (Raetic), Sondrio (Camunic), Lugano (Lepontic)]]\nSpecifically, the [[Old Italic script#Raetic alphabets|Raetic alphabet]] of [[Bolzano]] is often advanced as a candidate for the origin of the runes, with only five Elder Futhark runes ({{script|Runr|\u16d6}} ''e'', {{script|Runr|\u16c7}} ''\u00ef'', {{script|Runr|\u16c3}} ''j'', {{script|Runr|\u16dc}} ''\u014b'', {{script|Runr|\u16c8}} ''p'') having no counterpart in the Bolzano alphabet.{{Sfn | Mees | 2000}} Scandinavian scholars tend to favor derivation from the [[Latin alphabet]] itself over Raetic candidates.{{Sfn | Odenstedt | 1990}}{{Sfn | Williams | 1996}}<ref>{{Citation |url=http://ariadne.uio.no/runenews/odmarune.htm |publisher=Oxford University Press |title=Dictionary of the Middle Ages |type=under preparation |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070623082749/http://ariadne.uio.no/runenews/odmarune.htm |archivedate=2007-06-23 }}.</ref> A \"North Etruscan\" thesis is supported by the inscription on the [[Negau helmet]] dating to the 2nd century BC.{{Sfn|Markey|2001}} This is in a northern Etruscan alphabet but features a Germanic name, {{Lang|gem|Harigast}}. Giuliano and Larissa Bonfante suggest that runes derived from some North Italic alphabet, specifically [[Old Italic alphabet#Venetic alphabet|Venetic]]: but since [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] conquered [[Veneto]] after 200 BC, and then the [[Latin alphabet]] became prominent and [[Adriatic Veneti|Venetic]] culture diminished in importance, [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] people could have adopted the Venetic alphabet within the 3rd century BC or even earlier.<ref>[https://books.google.it/books?id=VWGN6e5Rzf8C&pg=PA119&lpg=PA119&dq=runes+from+venetic+alphabet&source=bl&ots=OeW0SOpgNo&sig=MPh3Dia9tqPSdKyLUiADT3dGguI&hl=it&sa=X&ei=pBSIVYTzNanNygPEiL8o&ved=0CDwQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&q=runes%20from%20venetic%20alphabet&f=false G.

There are no ''horizontal'' strokes: when carving a message on a flat staff or stick, it would be along the grain, thus both less legible and more likely to split the wood. This characteristic is also shared by other alphabets, such as the early form of the [[Latin alphabet]] used for the [[Duenos inscription]], but it is not universal, especially among early runic inscriptions, which frequently have variant rune shapes, including horizontal strokes. Runic manuscripts (that is ''written'' rather than carved runes, such as {{lang|la|[[Codex Runicus]]}}) also show horizontal strokes.\n\nThe \"[[West Germanic languages|West Germanic]] hypothesis\" speculates on an introduction by [[West Germanic tribes]]. This hypothesis is based on claiming that the earliest inscriptions of the 2nd and 3rd centuries, found in bogs and graves around [[Jutland]] (the [[Vimose inscriptions]]), exhibit word endings that, being interpreted by [[Scandinavia]]n scholars to be [[Proto-Norse]], are considered unresolved and long having been the subject of discussion. Inscriptions such as {{lang|gem|wagnija}}, {{lang|gem|ni\u00feijo}}, and {{lang|gem|harija}} are supposed to represent tribe names, tentatively proposed to be [[Vangiones]], the [[Nidensis]], and the [[Harii]] tribes located in the [[Rhineland]].{{Sfn | Looijenga | 1997}} Since names ending in {{lang|gem|-io}} reflect Germanic morphology representing the Latin ending {{lang|la|-ius}}, and the suffix {{lang|la|-inius}} was reflected by Germanic {{lang|gem|-inio-}},{{Sfn | Weisgerber | 1968 |pp=135, 392ff }}{{Sfn | Weisgerber | 1966\u20131967 | p = 207}} the question of the problematic ending {{lang|gem|-ijo}} in masculine Proto-Norse would be resolved by assuming Roman (Rhineland) influences, while \"the awkward ending -a of {{lang|gem|lagu\u00feewa}}{{Sfn | Syrett | 1994 | pp= 44ff}} may be solved by accepting the fact that the name may indeed be West Germanic\".{{Sfn | Looijenga | 1997}} In the early Runic period differences between Germanic languages are generally presumed to be small. Another theory presumes a [[Northwest Germanic]] unity preceding the emergence of Proto-Norse proper from roughly the 5th century.{{Refn |group=\"lower-alpha\" | {{Harvnb | Penzl | Hall | 1994a}} assume a period of \"Proto-Nordic-Westgermanic\" unity down to the 5th century and the [[Gallehus horns]] inscription.{{Sfn | Penzl | Hall | 1994b |p=186}}}}{{Refn |group=\"lower-alpha\" | The division between Northwest Germanic and Proto-Norse is somewhat arbitrary.{{Sfn | Antonsen | 1965 | p=36}}}} An alternative suggestion explaining the impossibility of classifying the earliest inscriptions as either North or West Germanic is forwarded by \u00c8. A. Makaev, who presumes a \"special runic [[koine]]\", an early \"literary Germanic\" employed by the entire Late Common Germanic linguistic community after the separation of Gothic (2nd to 5th centuries), while the spoken dialects may already have been more diverse.{{Sfn | Antonsen | 1965 |p=36}}\n\n===Early inscriptions===\n[[File:Pietroassa ring 1875.jpg|thumb|right|[[Ring of Pietroassa]] ({{circa|250\u2013400 AD}}) by Henri Trenk, 1875]]\nRunic inscriptions from the 400-year period 150\u2013550 AD are described as \"Period I\". These inscriptions are generally in [[Elder Futhark]], but the set of letter shapes and [[bindrune]]s employed is far from standardized. Notably the ''[[j\u0113ran|j]]'', ''[[sowilo rune|s]]'', and ''[[\u16dc|\u014b]]'' runes undergo considerable modifications, while others, such as ''[[\u16c8|p]]'' and ''[[\u16c7|\u00ef]]'', remain unattested altogether prior to the first full futhark row on the [[Kylver Stone]] ({{circa}} 400 AD).\n\nArtifacts such as spear heads or shield mounts have been found that bear runic marking that may be dated to 200 AD, as evidenced by artifacts found across northern Europe in Schleswig (North Germany), Fyn, Sj\u00e6lland, Jylland (Denmark), and Sk\u00e5ne (Sweden). Earlier\u2014but less reliable\u2014artifacts have been found in [[Meldorf]], S\u00fcderdithmarschen, northern Germany; these include brooches and combs found in graves, most notably the [[Meldorf fibula]], and are supposed to have the earliest markings resembling runic inscriptions.\n\nTheories of the existence of separate [[Gothic language|Gothic]] runes have been advanced, even identifying them as the original alphabet from which the Futhark were derived, but these have little support in archaeological findings (mainly the [[spearhead of Kovel]], with its right-to-left inscription, its T-shaped [[tiwaz rune|tiwaz]], and its rectangular [[dagaz]]). If there ever were genuinely Gothic runes, they were soon replaced by the [[Gothic alphabet]]. The letters of the Gothic alphabet, however, as given by the [[Alcuin]] manuscript (9th century), are obviously related to the names of the Futhark. The names are clearly Gothic, but it is impossible to say whether they are as old as the letters themselves. A handful of Elder Futhark inscriptions were found in Gothic territory, such as the 3rd- to 5th-century [[Ring of Pietroassa]].\n\nThe ''[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]'' even suggests the original development of the runes may have been due to the Goths.<ref>{{Citation |quote=A likely theory is that the runic alphabet was developed by the Goths, a Germanic people, from the Etruscan alphabet of northern Italy and was perhaps also influenced by the Latin alphabet in the 1st or 2nd century BC |title=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica |contribution-url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/512796/runic-alphabet |contribution=Runic alphabet|title-link=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica }}.</ref>\n\n===Magical or divinatory use===\n[[File:Brakteat von Djupbrunns.jpg|thumb|right|A [[bracteate]] ([[Alu (runic)#G 205|G 205]]) from approximately AD 400 that features the charm word {{lang|non|[[alu (runic)|alu]]}} with a depiction of a stylized male head, a horse, and a [[swastika]], a common motif on bracteates]]\n[[File:Gummarpstenen.gif|thumb|An illustration of the [[Gummarp Runestone]] (500\u2013700 AD) from [[Blekinge]], Sweden]]\n[[File:Bj\u00f6rketorpsstenen runor.jpg|right|thumb|Closeup of the runic inscription found on the 6th- or 7th-century [[Bj\u00f6rketorp Runestone]] located in [[Blekinge]], Sweden]]\n{{Main|Runic magic}}\nThe stanza 157 of {{lang|non|[[H\u00e1vam\u00e1l]]}} attribute to runes the power to bring that which is dead back to life.

Due to this, it is possible that the early runes were not used so much as a simple writing system, but rather as [[magic (paranormal)|magical]] signs to be used for charms. Although some say the runes were used for [[divination]], there is no direct evidence to suggest they were ever used in this way. The name ''rune'' itself, taken to mean \"secret, something hidden\", seems to indicate that knowledge of the runes was originally considered esoteric, or restricted to an elite. The 6th-century [[Bj\u00f6rketorp Runestone]] warns in [[Proto-Norse language|Proto-Norse]] using the word ''rune'' in both senses:\n{{Quote |{{lang|non|Haidzruno runu, falahak haidera, ginnarunaz.

There also are some inscriptions suggesting a medieval belief in the magical significance of runes, such as the [[Franks Casket]] (AD 700) panel.\n\nCharm words, such as {{lang|non|auja}}, {{lang|non|la\u00feu}}, {{lang|non|lauka\u0280}}, and most commonly, {{lang|non|[[alu (runic)|alu]]}},{{Sfn|MacLeod|Mees|2006|pp=100\u201301}} appear on a number of [[Migration period]] Elder Futhark inscriptions as well as variants and abbreviations of them. Much speculation and study has been produced on the potential meaning of these inscriptions. Rhyming groups appear on some early bracteates that also may be magical in purpose, such as {{lang|non|salusalu}} and {{lang|non|luwatuwa}}. Further, an inscription on the [[Gummarp Runestone]] (500\u2013700 AD) gives a cryptic inscription describing the use of three runic letters followed by the Elder Futhark f-rune written three times in succession.{{Sfn|Page|2005 |p=31}}\n\nNevertheless, it has proven difficult to find unambiguous traces of runic \"oracles\": although [[Old Norse language|Norse]] literature is full of references to runes, it nowhere contains specific instructions on divination.  There are at least three sources on divination with rather vague descriptions that may, or may not, refer to runes: [[Tacitus]]'s 1st-century {{lang|la|[[Germania (book)|Germania]]}}, [[Snorri Sturluson]]'s 13th-century {{lang|non|[[Ynglinga saga]]}}, and [[Rimbert]]'s 9th-century {{lang|la|[[Vita Ansgari]]}}.\n\nThe first source, Tacitus's {{lang|la|Germania}}, describes \"signs\" chosen in groups of three and cut from \"a nut-bearing tree\", although the runes do not seem to have been in use at the time of Tacitus' writings.  A second source is the {{lang|non|Ynglinga saga}}, where [[Granmar]], the king of {{lang|sv|[[S\u00f6dermanland]]|italic=no}}, goes to [[Gamla Uppsala|Uppsala]] for the {{lang|non|[[bl\u00f3t]]|italic=no}}. There, the \"chips\" fell in a way that said that he would not live long ({{lang|non|F\u00e9ll honum \u00fe\u00e1 svo sp\u00e1nn sem hann mundi eigi lengi lifa}}). These \"chips\", however, are easily explainable as a {{lang|non|bl\u00f3tsp\u00e1nn}} (sacrificial chip), which was \"marked, possibly with sacrificial blood, shaken, and thrown down like dice, and their positive or negative significance then decided.\"{{Sfn|Foote|Wilson|1970}}{{Rp |needed=yes |date=March 2013 }}\n\nThe third source is Rimbert's {{lang|la|Vita Ansgari}}, where there are three accounts of what some believe to be the use of runes for divination, but Rimbert calls it \"drawing lots\". One of these accounts is the description of how a renegade Swedish king, [[Anund Uppsale]], first brings a Danish fleet to [[Birka]], but then changes his mind and asks the Danes to \"draw lots\". According to the story, this \"drawing of lots\" was quite informative, telling them that attacking [[Birka]] would bring bad luck and that they should attack a Slavic town instead.  The tool in the \"drawing of lots\", however, is easily explainable as a {{lang|non|hlautlein}} (lot-twig), which according to Foote and Wilson{{Sfn|Foote|Wilson|1970|p=401}} would be used in the same manner as a {{lang|non|bl\u00f3tsp\u00e1nn}}.\n\nThe lack of extensive knowledge on historical use of the runes has not stopped modern authors from extrapolating entire systems of divination from what few specifics exist, usually loosely based on the reconstructed names of the runes and additional outside influence.\n\nA recent study of runic magic suggests that runes were used to create magical objects such as amulets,{{Sfn|MacLeod|Mees|2006}}{{Rp |needed=yes |date=March 2013}} but not in a way that would indicate that runic writing was any more inherently magical, than were other writing systems such as Latin or Greek.\n\n===Medieval use===\n[[Image:CodexRunicus.jpeg|thumb|left|[[Codex Runicus]], a [[vellum]] manuscript from approximately 1300 AD containing one of the oldest and best preserved texts of the [[Scanian Law]], is written entirely in runes.]]{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2017}}\nAs [[Proto-Germanic]] evolved into its later language groups, the words assigned to the runes and the sounds represented by the runes themselves began to diverge somewhat and each culture would create new runes, rename or rearrange its rune names slightly, or stop using obsolete runes completely, to accommodate these changes. Thus, the Anglo-Saxon futhorc has several runes peculiar to itself to represent [[diphthong]]s unique to (or at least prevalent in) the Anglo-Saxon dialect.\n\nNevertheless, that the Younger Futhark has 16 runes, while the Elder Futhark has 24, is not fully explained by the 600-some years of sound changes that had occurred in the North Germanic language group.<ref>{{cite book\n|last1       = McDermott\n|first1      = Larissa\n|year        = 2016\n|title       = Runes\n|url         = https://books.google.com/books?id=8h08DAAAQBAJ&pg=PA70&dq=%22Elder+Futhark+contains+a+total+of%22\n|publisher   = [[Lulu.com|Lulu Press]]\n|page        = 70\n|access-date = 2018-05-22\n|isbn      = 9781365130724\n}}</ref>{{sps|date=February 2020}} The development here might seem rather astonishing, since the younger form of the alphabet came to use fewer different rune signs at the same time as the development of the language led to a greater number of different phonemes than had been present at the time of the older futhark. For example, voiced and unvoiced consonants merged in script, and so did many vowels, while the number of vowels in the spoken language increased. From {{circa}} 1100 AD, this disadvantage was eliminated in the medieval runes, which again increased the number of different signs to correspond with the number of phonemes in the language.\n\nSome later runic finds are on monuments ([[runestone]]s), which often contain solemn inscriptions about people who died or performed great deeds. For a long time it was presumed that this kind of grand inscription was the primary use of runes, and that their use was associated with a certain societal class of rune carvers.\n\nIn the mid-1950s, however, approximately 670 inscriptions, known as the [[Bryggen inscriptions]], were found in [[Bergen, Norway|Bergen]].<ref>{{cite book\n|last1       = William\n|first1      = Gareth\n|year        = 2007\n|title       = West over Sea: Studies in Scandinavian Sea-Borne Expansion and Settlement Before 1300\n|url         = https://books.google.com/books?id=U-2vCQAAQBAJ&pg=PA473&dq=%22rune-inscribed+sticks+from+bryggen%22\n|publisher   = [[Brill Publishers]]\n|page        = 473\n|access-date = 2018-05-22\n|isbn      = 9789047421214\n}}</ref> These inscriptions were made on wood and bone, often in the shape of sticks of various sizes, and contained inscriptions of an everyday nature\u2014ranging from name tags, prayers (often in [[Latin]]), personal messages, business letters, and expressions of affection, to bawdy phrases of a profane and sometimes even of a vulgar nature. Following this find, it is nowadays commonly presumed that, at least in late use, Runic was a widespread and common writing system.\n\n[[File:BM-ClogAlmanac.JPG|right|thumb|17th-century clog almanac collected by Sir Hans Sloane. Now in the collection of the British Museum]]\nIn the later Middle Ages, runes also were used in the [[runic calendar|clog almanacs]] (sometimes called ''Runic staff'', ''Prim'', or ''Scandinavian calendar'') of Sweden and [[Estonia]]. The authenticity of some monuments bearing Runic inscriptions found in Northern America is disputed; most of them have been dated to modern times.\n\n===Runes in Eddic lore===\nIn [[Norse mythology]], the runic alphabet is attested to a divine origin ({{lang-non|reginkunnr}}). This is attested as early as on the [[Noleby Runestone]] from {{circa|600 AD}} that reads {{lang|non|Runo fahi raginakundo toj[e'k]a...}}, meaning \"I prepare the suitable divine rune...\"<ref name=\"RUNDATAVG63\">{{Citation |type=entry |contribution=Vg 63 |title=Rundata |edition=2.0 for Windows|title-link=Rundata }}.</ref> and in an attestation from the 9th century on the [[Sparl\u00f6sa Runestone]], which reads {{lang|non|Ok ra\u00f0 runa\u0280 \u00fea\u0280 r\u00e6gi[n]kundu}}, meaning \"And interpret the runes of divine origin\".<ref name=\"RUNDATVG119\">{{Citation |type=entry |contribution=Vg 119 |title=Rundata |edition=2.0 for Windows|title-link=Rundata }}.</ref> In the [[Poetic Edda]] poem {{lang|non|[[H\u00e1vam\u00e1l]]}}, Stanza 80, the runes also are described as {{lang|non|reginkunnr}}:\n{{Verse translation |lang=non\n|\u00deat er \u00fe\u00e1 reynt,\ner \u00fe\u00fa a\u00f0 r\u00fanum spyrr\ninum reginkunnum,\n\u00feeim er ger\u00f0u ginnregin\nok f\u00e1\u00f0i fimbul\u00feulr,\n\u00fe\u00e1 hefir hann bazt, ef hann \u00feegir.<ref name=\"H\u00e1vam\u00e1l\"/>\n|\nThat is now proved,\nwhat you asked of the runes,\nof the potent famous ones,\nwhich the great gods made,\nand the mighty sage stained,\nthat it is best for him if he stays silent.{{Sfn|Larrington|1999|p=25}}\n}}\n\nThe poem {{lang|non|H\u00e1vam\u00e1l}} explains that the originator of the runes was the major deity, [[Odin]].

These sons became the ancestors of the three classes of humans indicated by their names. When Jarl reached an age when he began to handle weapons and show other signs of nobility, {{lang|non|R\u00edg|italic=no}} returned and, having claimed him as a son, taught him the runes. In 1555, the exiled Swedish archbishop {{lang|non|[[Olaus Magnus]]|italic=no}} recorded a tradition that a man named {{lang|non|[[Kettil Runske]]|italic=no}} had stolen three rune staffs from Odin and learned the runes and their magic.\n\n==Runic alphabets==\n\n=== Elder Futhark (2nd to 8th centuries) ===\n[[Image:Inscription on Golden horn of Gallehus.jpg|thumb|right|Detail of the Elder Futhark inscription on a replica of one of the 5th-century AD [[Golden Horns of Gallehus]] found on [[Jutland]], now Denmark]]\n{{Main article |Elder Futhark}}\nThe Elder Futhark, used for writing [[Proto-Norse]], consists of 24 runes that often are arranged in three groups of eight; each group is referred to as an [[Norse clans#Runology|\u00c6tt]].

One theory proposes that it was developed in [[Frisia]] and later spread to [[England]],{{citation needed|date=November 2016}} while another holds that Scandinavians introduced runes to England, where the futhorc was modified and exported to Frisia.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}} Some examples of futhorc inscriptions are found on the [[Thames scramasax]], in the [[Vienna Codex (Anglo-Saxon)|Vienna Codex]], in [[Cotton Otho]] B.x ([[Anglo-Saxon rune poem]]) and on the [[Ruthwell Cross]].\n\nThe Anglo-Saxon rune poem gives the following characters and names: {{script|Runr|\u16a0}} feoh, {{script|Runr|\u16a2}} ur, {{script|Runr|\u16a6}} \u00feorn, {{script|Runr |\u16a9}} os, {{script|Runr|\u16b1}} rad, {{script|Runr|\u16b3}} cen, {{script|Runr|\u16b7}} gyfu, {{script|Runr|\u16b9}} \u01bfynn, {{script|Runr|\u16bb}} h\u00e6gl, {{script|Runr|\u16be}} nyd, {{script|Runr |\u16c1}} is, {{script|Runr|\u16c4}} ger, {{script|Runr |\u16c7}} eoh, {{script|Runr |\u16c8}} peor\u00f0, {{script|Runr|\u16c9}} eolh, {{script|Runr|\u16cb}} sigel, {{script|Runr|\u16cf}} tir, {{script|Runr|\u16d2}} beorc, {{script|Runr|\u16d6}} eh, {{script|Runr|\u16d7}} mann, {{script|Runr|\u16da}} lagu, {{script|Runr|\u16dd}} ing, {{script|Runr|\u16df}} \u0153thel, {{script|Runr|\u16de}} d\u00e6g, {{script|Runr|\u16aa}} ac, {{script|Runr|\u16ab}} \u00e6sc, {{script|Runr|\u16a3}} yr, {{script|Runr|\u16e1}} ior, {{script|Runr|\u16e0}} ear.\n\nExtra runes attested to outside of the rune poem include {{script|Runr|\u16e2}} cweor\u00f0, {{script|Runr|\u16e3}} calc, {{script|Runr|\u16b8}} gar, and {{script|Runr|\u16e5}} stan. Some of these additional letters have only been found in [[Pseudo-runes|manuscripts]]. Feoh, \u00feorn, and sigel stood for [f], [\u00fe], and [s] in most environments, but voiced to [v], [\u00f0], and [z] between vowels or voiced consonants. Gyfu and wynn stood for the letters [[yogh]] and [[wynn]], which became [g] and [w] in [[Middle English]].\n\n===\"Marcomannic runes\" (8th to 9th centuries)===\n[[Image:Marcomannic.PNG|thumb| 310px|[[Marcomanni]]c runes]]\nA runic alphabet consisting of a mixture of Elder Futhark with Anglo-Saxon futhorc is recorded in a treatise called ''De Inventione Litterarum'', ascribed to [[Hrabanus Maurus]] and preserved in 8th- and 9th-century manuscripts mainly from the southern part of the [[Carolingian Empire]] ([[Alemannia]], [[Bavaria]]). The manuscript text attributes the runes to the ''Marcomanni, quos nos Nordmannos vocamus'', and hence traditionally, the alphabet is called \"Marcomannic runes\", but it has no connection with the [[Marcomanni]], and rather is an attempt of Carolingian scholars to represent all letters of the Latin alphabets with runic equivalents.\n\n[[Wilhelm Grimm]] discussed these runes in 1821.<ref>{{Citation | last = Grimm | first = William | year = 1821 | author-link = Wilhelm Grimm | title = Ueber deutsche Runen |trans-title=Concerning German runes | language = German | chapter = 18 | pages = 149\u201359}}.</ref>\n\n===Younger Futhark (9th to 11th centuries)===\n{{Main article |Younger Futhark}}\n[[Image:Yngre futharken.svg|thumb|280px|The [[Younger Futhark]]: long-branch runes and short-twig runes]]\n[[Image:Sigurd.svg|left|thumb|While also featuring a runic inscription detailing the erection of a bridge for a loved one, the 11th-century [[Sigurd stones#S\u00f6 101|Ramsung carving]] is a [[Sigurd stones|Sigurd stone]] that depicts the legend of [[Sigurd]].]]\nThe Younger Futhark, also called Scandinavian Futhark, is a reduced form of the [[Elder Futhark]], consisting of only 16 characters. The reduction correlates with phonetic changes when [[Proto-Norse]] evolved into [[Old Norse language|Old Norse]]. They are found in Scandinavia and [[Viking Age]] settlements abroad, probably in use from the 9th century onward. They are divided into long-branch (Danish) and short-twig (Swedish and Norwegian) runes.  The difference between the two versions is a matter of controversy. A general opinion is that the difference between them was functional (viz., the long-branch runes were used for documentation on stone, whereas the short-twig runes were in everyday use for private or official messages on wood).\n\n===Medieval runes  (12th to 15th centuries)===\n{{Main article |Medieval runes}}\n[[Image:Medeltida runor.svg|410px|right|thumb|[[Medieval runes]] ]]\n[[Image:Saleby kyrkklocka, V\u00e4sterg\u00f6tland.png|left|thumb|A church bell from Saleby, [[V\u00e4sterg\u00f6tland]], Sweden, containing a runic inscription from 1228 AD]]\nIn the Middle Ages, the Younger Futhark in Scandinavia was expanded, so that it once more contained one sign for each phoneme of the [[Old Norse language]]. Dotted variants of [[voiceless]] signs were introduced to denote the corresponding [[voiced]] consonants, or vice versa, voiceless variants of voiced consonants, and several new runes also appeared for vowel sounds. Inscriptions in medieval Scandinavian runes show a large number of variant rune forms, and some letters, such as ''s'', ''c'', and ''z'' often were used interchangeably.{{Sfn | Jacobsen | Moltke | 1942 | p = vii}}{{Sfn | Werner | 2004 | p = 20}}\n\nMedieval runes were in use until the 15th century. Of the total number of Norwegian runic inscriptions preserved today, most are medieval runes.  Notably, more than 600 inscriptions using these runes have been discovered in [[Bergen (Norway)|Bergen]] since the 1950s, mostly on wooden sticks (the so-called [[Bryggen inscriptions]]). This indicates that runes were in common use side by side with the Latin alphabet for several centuries. Indeed, some of the medieval runic inscriptions are written in Latin.\n\n===Dalecarlian runes (16th to 19th centuries)===\n{{Main article|Dalecarlian runes}}\n[[Image:Dalrunor.svg|410px|thumb|[[Dalecarlian runes]] ]]\nAccording to Carl-Gustav Werner, \"In the isolated province of [[Dalarna]] in Sweden a mix of runes and Latin letters developed.\"{{Sfn | Werner | 2004 | p = 7}}  The Dalecarlian runes came into use in the early 16th century and remained in some use up to the 20th century.<ref>{{cite news |last=Brix |first=Lise |title=Isolated people in Sweden only stopped using runes 100 years ago |date=May 21, 2015 |url=http://sciencenordic.com/isolated-people-sweden-only-stopped-using-runes-100-years-ago |work=ScienceNordic}}</ref> Some discussion remains on whether their use was an unbroken tradition throughout this period or whether people in the 19th and 20th centuries learned runes from books written on the subject. The character inventory was used mainly for transcribing [[Elfdalian]].\n\n==Academic study==\n{{Main article |Runology}}\nThe modern study of runes was initiated during the Renaissance, by [[Johannes Bureus]] (1568\u20131652). Bureus viewed runes as holy or magical in a [[kabbalah|kabbalistic]] sense.\nThe study of runes was continued by [[Olof Rudbeck|Olof Rudbeck Sr]] (1630\u20131702) and presented in his collection ''Atlantica''. [[Anders Celsius]] (1701\u20131744) further extended the science of runes and travelled around the whole of Sweden to examine the ''runstenar'' ([[runestone]]s).  From the  \"golden age of [[philology]]\" in the 19th century, runology formed a specialized branch of [[Germanic linguistics]].\n\n==Body of inscriptions==\n{{Main article |Runic inscriptions}}\n[[Image:Kam-med-runer-fra-Vimose DO-4148 2000.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Vimose inscriptions|Vimose Comb]] from the island of [[Funen]], Denmark, features the earliest known runic inscription (AD 150 to 200) and simply reads, \u16ba\u16a8\u16b1\u16c3\u16a8 \"Harja\", a male name.<ref>{{cite book | last= Looijenga |first= Tineke | title = Texts and Contexts of the Oldest Runic Inscriptions |publisher=Brill |location=Leiden |year = 2003 | page = 160 |isbn= 978-90-04-12396-0}}</ref>]]\nThe largest group of surviving Runic inscription are [[Viking Age]] [[Younger Futhark]] runestones, commonly found in Denmark and Sweden.<ref>{{cite book\n|last1       = de Gruyter\n|first1      = Walter\n|year        = 2002\n|title       = The Nordic Languages, Volume 1\n|url         = https://books.google.com/books?id=PBKxhq2p0PgC&pg=PA700&dq=%22Younger+Futhark+were+used+more%22\n|publisher   = \n|page        = 700\n|access-date = 2018-05-22\n|isbn      = 9783110197051\n}}</ref> Another large group are medieval runes, most commonly found on small objects, often wooden sticks. The largest concentration of runic inscriptions are the [[Bryggen inscriptions]] found in [[Bergen, Norway|Bergen]], more than 650 in total. [[Elder Futhark]] inscriptions number around 350, about 260 of which are from Scandinavia, of which about half are on [[bracteate]]s. [[Anglo-Saxon runes|Anglo-Saxon futhorc]] inscriptions number around 100 items.\n\n==Modern use==\n{{main article|Modern runic writing}}\nRunic alphabets have seen numerous uses since the 18th-century [[Viking revival]], in Scandinavian [[Romantic nationalism]] ([[Gothicismus]]) and [[Germanic occultism]] in the 19th century, and in the context of the [[Fantasy]] genre and of [[Germanic Neopaganism]] in the 20th century.\n\n===Esotericism===\n\n==== Germanic mysticism and Nazi symbolism ====\n{{Further|Runosophy|Armanen runes|Wiligut runes|Runengymnastik}}\n[[File:EBay 025.jpg|thumb|Runic script on an 1886 gravestone in [[Parkend]], [[England]] ]]\n[[Image:Flag Schutzstaffel.svg|thumb|180px|From 1933, [[Schutzstaffel unit insignia]] displayed two [[Sig Rune]]s]]\nThe pioneer of the ''[[Armanist]]'' branch of [[Ariosophy]] and one of the more important figures in [[esotericism in Germany and Austria]] in the late 19th and early 20th century was the [[Austria]]n occultist, mysticist, and [[v\u00f6lkisch]] author, [[Guido von List]]. In 1908, he published in ''[[Das Geheimnis der Runen]]'' (\"The Secret of the Runes\") a set of eighteen so-called, \"[[Armanen runes]]\", based on the Younger Futhark and runes of List's own introduction, which allegedly were revealed to him in a state of temporary blindness after cataract operations on both eyes in 1902.\nThe use of runes in [[Germanic mysticism]], notably List's \"Armanen runes\" and the derived \"[[Wiligut runes]]\" by [[Karl Maria Wiligut]], played a certain role in [[Nazi symbolism]]. The fascination with runic symbolism was mostly limited to [[Heinrich Himmler]], and not shared by the other members of the Nazi top echelon. Consequently, runes appear mostly in insignia associated with the ''[[Schutzstaffel]]'', the paramilitary organization led by Himmler. Wiligut is credited with designing the [[SS-Ehrenring]], which displays a number of \"Wiligut runes\".\n\n====Modern neopaganism and esotericism====\nRunes are popular in [[Germanic neopaganism]], and to a lesser extent in other forms of [[Neopaganism]] and [[New Age]] esotericism. Various systems of [[Runic divination]] have been published since the 1980s, notably by [[Ralph Blum]] (1982), [[Stephen Flowers]] (1984, onward), [[Stephan Grundy]] (1990), and [[Nigel Pennick]] (1995).\n\nThe [[Uthark theory]] originally was proposed as a scholarly hypothesis by [[Sigurd Agrell]] in 1932.\nIn 2002, Swedish esotericist [[Thomas Karlsson]] popularized this \"Uthark\" runic row, which he refers to as, the \"night side of the runes\", in the context of modern occultism.\n\n=== Bluetooth ===\nThe [[Bluetooth]] logo is the combination of two runes of the [[Younger Futhark]], [[Haglaz]] and [[Berkanan]], equivalent to the letters \u00abH\u00bb and \u00abB\u00bb, that are the initials of [[Harald Bluetooth|Harald Bl\u00e5tand's]] name (''bluetooth'' in English), who was a king of Denmark from the [[Viking Age|Viking age]].\n[[File:BluetoothLogo.svg|thumb|224x224px|[[Bluetooth]] logo with the initials of [[Harald Bluetooth|Harald Bl\u00e5tand]].]]\n\n===J. R. R. Tolkien and contemporary fiction===\n{{See also|Cirth#Runes from The Hobbit}}\nIn [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s novel ''[[The Hobbit]]'' (1937), the Anglo-Saxon runes are used on a map to emphasize its connection to the [[Dwarf (Middle-earth)|Dwarves]]. They also were used in the initial drafts of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', but later were replaced by the [[Cirth]] rune-like alphabet invented by Tolkien, used to write the language of the Dwarves, [[Khuzdul]].  Following Tolkien, historical and fictional runes appear commonly in modern popular culture, particularly in [[fantasy literature]], but also in other forms of media such as [[video games]] (for example the 1992 video game ''[[Heimdall (video game)|Heimdall]]'' used it as \"magical symbols\" associated with unnatural forces).\n\n==Unicode==\n{{Main article|Runic (Unicode block)}}\n[[File:Runen Schlagstempel.jpg|thumb|Runic Steel Stamps, Elder Futhark]]\nRunic alphabets were added to the [[Unicode]] Standard in September, 1999 with the release of version 3.0.\n\nThe [[Unicode block]] for Runic alphabets is U+16A0\u2013U+16FF. It is intended to encode the letters of the [[Elder Futhark]], the [[Anglo-Frisian runes]], and the [[Younger Futhark]] long-branch and short-twig (but not the staveless) variants, in cases where cognate letters have the same shape resorting to \"[[Universal Character Set characters|unification]]\".\n\nThe block as of Unicode 3.0 contained 81 symbols: 75 runic letters (U+16A0\u2013U+16EA), 3 punctuation marks (Runic Single Punctuation U+16EB {{script|Runr|\u16eb}}, Runic Multiple Punctuation U+16EC {{script|Runr|\u16ec}} and Runic Cross Punctuation U+16ED {{script|Runr|\u16ed}}), and three runic symbols that are used in early modern [[runic calendar]] staves (\"Golden number Runes\", Runic [[Arlaug]] Symbol U+16EE {{script|Runr|\u16ee}}, Runic [[Tvimadur]] Symbol U+16EF {{script|Runr|\u16ef}}, Runic [[Belgthor]] Symbol U+16F0 {{script|Runr|\u16f0}}). As of Unicode 7.0 (2014), eight characters were added, three attributed to [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s mode of writing Modern English in Anglo-Saxon runes, and five for the \"cryptogrammic\" vowel symbols used in an inscription on the [[Franks Casket]].\n\n{{Unicode chart Runic}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[Bergakker inscription|Runic inscription in the Netherlands]]\n* [[Pentimal system]] of numerals\n* [[Runic magic]]\n* [[Runiform (disambiguation)]] for unrelated scripts sometimes described as \"runes\" or \"rune-like\"\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist | group = \"lower-alpha\"}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n{{Refbegin |2}}\n* {{Citation | first = Elmer H. | last = Antonsen | title = On Defining Stages in Prehistoric Germanic | journal = Language | volume = 41 | issue = 1 | pages = 19\u201336 | year = 1965 | doi = 10.2307/411849 | jstor = 411849 }}.<!--\n* {{Citation | editor1-last = Bammesberger | editor1-first = A | editor2-first = G | editor2-last = Waxenberger | title = Das fu\u00feark und Seine Einzelsprachlichen Weiterentwicklungen | publisher = Walter de Gruyter | year = 2006 | isbn = 3-11-019008-7}}.\n* {{Citation | last = Blum | first = Ralph | year = 1932 | title = The Book of Runes \u2013 A Handbook for the use of Ancient Oracle: The Viking Runes | series = Oracle Books | publisher = St. Martin's Press | place = New York | isbn = 0-312-00729-9}}.\n* {{Citation | author-link = Erik Brate| last = Brate | first = Erik | year = 1922 | title = Sveriges Runinskrifter | url = http://www.runor.se/ | language = Swedish}}.\n* {{Citation | last = D\u00fcwel | first = Klaus | year = 2001 | title = Runenkunde | publisher = JB Metzler | language = German}}. -->\n* {{Citation | last1 = Foote | first1 = P.
