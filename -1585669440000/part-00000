people into their Union Square store in [[New York City]], March 18, 2020]]\n=== Lack of enforcement of self-quarantine policies ===\nSelf-quarantines for persons who test positive or are symptomatic are not enforced due to a lack of resources. Several New York City area nurses have expressed concerns that patients are not complying with self-quarantine guidelines due to financial necessity or fear of losing their jobs. A New York State Nurses Association board member has expressed concerns that low-income patients who share rooms with other individuals may not be able to effectively self-isolate at their residences.<ref>{{cite news|title=NYC nurses fear many coronavirus patients can't afford to self-quarantine|url=https://www.nydailynews.com/coronavirus/ny-coronavirus-nurses-fear-patients-not-self-quarantining-20200324-rd5x2xa3gzc3nhmv3e36u5n3iu-story.html|date=March 24, 2020|work=Daily News}}</ref>\n\n=== Difficulties of implementation in Hasidic communities ===\nImplementing social distancing has been especially difficult in some communities dominated by [[Hasidic Jews]]. The [[Orange County, New York|Orange County]] village of [[Kiryas Joel, New York|Kiryas Joel]], home to 25,000 [[Satmar Hasidim]], closed all 100 of its synagogues, as well as schools and ''[[mikvah]]''s on March 19, despite the centrality of religious observance in the community. It is estimated that 25\u201328 percent of its residents have tested positive, including the community's spiritual leader, Grand Rebbe [[Aaron Teitelbaum]].<ref name=\"Ha'aretz article\">{{cite news|last=Ziri|first=Danielle|url=https://www.haaretz.com/us-news/.premium-in-america-s-only-orthodox-town-the-coronavirus-brings-unique-problems-1.8710123|title=In America's Only Orthodox Town, Coronavirus Poses Unique Challenge for Insular Jewish Community|date=March 25, 2020|newspaper=[[Haaretz]]|accessdate=March 26, 2020}}</ref> On March 27 the county reported that Kiryas Joel, as the town of Palm Tree, had 234 confirmed cases, the most of any municipality in the county.<ref>{{cite web|title=COVID-19/Coronavirus|url=https://www.orangecountygov.com/1936/Coronavirus|publisher=[[Orange County, New York|Orange County]] Department of Health|date=March 27, 2020|accessdate=March 30, 2020}}</ref>\n\nSome other reports have suggested that the Hasidic community has generally been slow to implement measures designed to slow the spread of the virus. This has reportedly led to one [[antisemitism in the United States|antisemitic]] incident. On March 23 a car dealership near Kiryas Joel refused to service a resident's car, telling him he had the virus.<ref name=\"Forward article\">{{cite news|last=Feldman|first=Ari|url=https://forward.com/news/national/442285/coronavirus-hydroxychloroquine-trump-doctor/|title=This doctor was already treating patients with Trump's 'gift from God' drug - before FDA approval|date=March 24, 2020|newspaper=[[The Forward]]|accessdate=March 26, 2020}}</ref>\n\nAn [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] physician, Dr. Vladimir Zelenko, who sees patients at his offices in both Kiryas Joel and [[Monsey, New York|Monsey]], another predominantly Hasidic community in nearby [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland County]], claims that the real infection rate in Kiryas Joel is much higher, claims that have been disputed by local authorities. Zelenko, who must self-isolate since he is missing a lung, says in daily [[YouTube]] videos he posts that he has treated 500 patients (mostly in Kiryas Joel) for COVID-19, using the combination of [[hydroxychloroquine]] and [[azithromycin]] or [[zinc sulfate]], which has in some trials yielded positive results in reducing symptoms.

people into their Union Square store in [[New York City]], March 18, 2020]]\n=== Lack of enforcement of self-quarantine policies ===\nSelf-quarantines for persons who test positive or are symptomatic are not enforced due to a lack of resources. Several New York City area nurses have expressed concerns that patients are not complying with self-quarantine guidelines due to financial necessity or fear of losing their jobs. A New York State Nurses Association board member has expressed concerns that low-income patients who share rooms with other individuals may not be able to effectively self-isolate at their residences.<ref>{{cite news|title=NYC nurses fear many coronavirus patients can't afford to self-quarantine|url=https://www.nydailynews.com/coronavirus/ny-coronavirus-nurses-fear-patients-not-self-quarantining-20200324-rd5x2xa3gzc3nhmv3e36u5n3iu-story.html|date=March 24, 2020|work=Daily News}}</ref>\n\n=== Difficulties of implementation in Hasidic communities ===\nImplementing social distancing has been especially difficult in some communities dominated by [[Hasidic Jews]]. The [[Orange County, New York|Orange County]] village of [[Kiryas Joel, New York|Kiryas Joel]], home to 25,000 [[Satmar Hasidim]], closed all 100 of its synagogues, as well as schools and ''[[mikvah]]''s on March 19, despite the centrality of religious observance in the community. It is estimated that 25\u201328 percent of its residents have tested positive, including the community's spiritual leader, Grand Rebbe [[Aaron Teitelbaum]].<ref name=\"Ha'aretz article\">{{cite news|last=Ziri|first=Danielle|url=https://www.haaretz.com/us-news/.premium-in-america-s-only-orthodox-town-the-coronavirus-brings-unique-problems-1.8710123|title=In America's Only Orthodox Town, Coronavirus Poses Unique Challenge for Insular Jewish Community|date=March 25, 2020|newspaper=[[Haaretz]]|accessdate=March 26, 2020}}</ref> On March 27 the county reported that Kiryas Joel, as the town of Palm Tree, had 234 confirmed cases, the most of any municipality in the county.<ref>{{cite web|title=COVID-19/Coronavirus|url=https://www.orangecountygov.com/1936/Coronavirus|publisher=[[Orange County, New York|Orange County]] Department of Health|date=March 27, 2020|accessdate=March 30, 2020}}</ref>\n\nSome other reports have suggested that the Hasidic community has generally been slow to implement measures designed to slow the spread of the virus. This has reportedly led to one [[antisemitism in the United States|antisemitic]] incident. On March 23 a car dealership near Kiryas Joel refused to service a resident's car, telling him he had the virus.<ref name=\"Forward article\">{{cite news|last=Feldman|first=Ari|url=https://forward.com/news/national/442285/coronavirus-hydroxychloroquine-trump-doctor/|title=This doctor was already treating patients with Trump's 'gift from God' drug - before FDA approval|date=March 24, 2020|newspaper=[[The Forward]]|accessdate=March 26, 2020}}</ref>\n\nAn [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] physician, Dr. Vladimir Zelenko, who sees patients at his offices in both Kiryas Joel and [[Monsey, New York|Monsey]], another predominantly Hasidic community in nearby [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland County]], claims that the real infection rate in Kiryas Joel is much higher, claims that have been disputed by local authorities. Zelenko, who must self-isolate since he is missing a lung, says in daily [[YouTube]] videos he posts that he has treated 500 patients (mostly in Kiryas Joel) for COVID-19, using the combination of [[hydroxychloroquine]] and [[azithromycin]] or [[zinc sulfate]], which has in some trials yielded positive results in reducing symptoms.

VapoRub is intended for use [[Chest rub|on the chest]], back and throat for cough suppression or on muscles and joints for minor aches and pains. It has also been used to treat mosquito bites.{{Citation needed|date=January 2019}} Users of VapoRub often apply it immediately before sleep.\n\nFirst sold in 1905, VapoRub was originally manufactured by the family-owned company Richardson-Vicks, Inc., based in [[Greensboro, North Carolina]]. Richardson-Vicks was sold to Procter & Gamble in 1985 and is now known as Vicks. VapoRub is also manufactured and packaged in India and Mexico. In [[German-speaking countries]] (apart from Switzerland), it is sold under the name ''Wick VapoRub''.<ref>{{cite web |title=WICK Vaporub Erk\u00e4ltungssalbe: gegen Erk\u00e4ltung |url=http://www.wick.de/produkte/gegen-schnupfen/vapo-rub-erkaeltungssalbe-was-hilft-gegen-schnupfen/ |publisher=Wick.de |date=2016-01-02 |language=German |accessdate=2017-06-17}}</ref> VapoRub continues to be Vicks's flagship product internationally, and the Vicks brand name is often used synonymously with the VapoRub product.\n\n==History==\nAccording to [[Joe Schwarcz]], the product can be traced to Jules Bengue, a French pharmacist, who created [[Bengay|Ben-Gay]], a menthol-based treatment for arthritis, gout and neuralgia. [[Lunsford Richardson]], a pharmacist in Selma, North Carolina, sold Ben-Gay and heard from his customers that it cleared their sinuses. He blended menthol into petroleum jelly, at first calling it Richardson's Croup and Pneumonia Cure Salve, later changing the name to Vicks VapoRub. It was named after Richard's brother-in-law, Joshua Vick, a physician who had arranged for Richardson to have access to a laboratory to create the product. Richardson began selling it in 1905.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Schwarcz|first1=Joe|title=Dr. Joe and what You Didn't Know|date=2003|publisher=ECW Press|location=Toronto|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=vAXcX2xm6esC&pg=PA142&lpg=PA142 142]}}</ref> In 2019, Vicks re-introduced VapoCream, a cream version of VapoRub - which was previously discontinued in the early 2000s.\n\nThe product is a cultural touchstone among [[Hispanic and Latino Americans]].<ref name=\"Los Angeles Times article\">{{cite news|last=Bermudez|first=Esmerelda|title=\u2018Vivaporu\u2019: For many Latinos, memories of Vicks VapoRub are as strong as the scent of eucalyptus|date=March 26, 2019|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|accessdate=October 26, 2019|url=https://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-col1-vicks-vaporub-20190326-htmlstory.html}}</ref>\n\n==Usage==\n{{medref|section|date=November 2019}}\n[[File:Vicks vaporub ad 1922.png|thumb|Vaporub ad from 1922, showing the international ingredients and the factory]]\nVapoRub can be inhaled with hot steam.

VapoRub is intended for use [[Chest rub|on the chest]], back and throat for cough suppression or on muscles and joints for minor aches and pains. It has also been used to treat mosquito bites.{{Citation needed|date=January 2019}} Users of VapoRub often apply it immediately before sleep.\n\nFirst sold in 1905, VapoRub was originally manufactured by the family-owned company Richardson-Vicks, Inc., based in [[Greensboro, North Carolina]]. Richardson-Vicks was sold to Procter & Gamble in 1985 and is now known as Vicks. VapoRub is also manufactured and packaged in India and Mexico. In [[German-speaking countries]] (apart from Switzerland), it is sold under the name ''Wick VapoRub''.<ref>{{cite web |title=WICK Vaporub Erk\u00e4ltungssalbe: gegen Erk\u00e4ltung |url=http://www.wick.de/produkte/gegen-schnupfen/vapo-rub-erkaeltungssalbe-was-hilft-gegen-schnupfen/ |publisher=Wick.de |date=2016-01-02 |language=German |accessdate=2017-06-17}}</ref> VapoRub continues to be Vicks's flagship product internationally, and the Vicks brand name is often used synonymously with the VapoRub product.\n\n==History==\nAccording to [[Joe Schwarcz]], the product can be traced to Jules Bengue, a French pharmacist, who created [[Bengay|Ben-Gay]], a menthol-based treatment for arthritis, gout and neuralgia. [[Lunsford Richardson]], a pharmacist in Selma, North Carolina, sold Ben-Gay and heard from his customers that it cleared their sinuses. He blended menthol into petroleum jelly, at first calling it Richardson's Croup and Pneumonia Cure Salve, later changing the name to Vicks VapoRub. It was named after Richard's brother-in-law, Joshua Vick, a physician who had arranged for Richardson to have access to a laboratory to create the product. Richardson began selling it in 1905.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Schwarcz|first1=Joe|title=Dr. Joe and what You Didn't Know|date=2003|publisher=ECW Press|location=Toronto|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=vAXcX2xm6esC&pg=PA142&lpg=PA142 142]}}</ref> In 2019, Vicks re-introduced VapoCream, a cream version of VapoRub - which was previously discontinued in the early 2000's.\n\nThe product is a cultural touchstone among [[Hispanic and Latino Americans]].<ref name=\"Los Angeles Times article\">{{cite news|last=Bermudez|first=Esmerelda|title=\u2018Vivaporu\u2019: For many Latinos, memories of Vicks VapoRub are as strong as the scent of eucalyptus|date=March 26, 2019|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|accessdate=October 26, 2019|url=https://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-col1-vicks-vaporub-20190326-htmlstory.html}}</ref>\n\n==Usage==\n{{medref|section|date=November 2019}}\n[[File:Vicks vaporub ad 1922.png|thumb|Vaporub ad from 1922, showing the international ingredients and the factory]]\nVapoRub can be inhaled with hot steam.

Pettway. She and her siblings frequently worked on her grandfather, Tank Pettway's, farm growing cotton, corn, peanuts, and sweet potatoes, among other crops. Bennett remarks on the naming traditions of Gee's Bend using her family as an example: <blockquote>\"Aunt Lucy was the sister of my father, Tom O. Pettway, Jr. An interesting thing is that Aunt Lucy\u2019s middle name was Tomo. Because so many people in Gee\u2019s Bend have the name of Pettway, people get middle names that let others know who their fathers are, so nobody marries a close cousin by mistake. My father and his father carry the middle initial O. for Ottaway, a name that goes back to an original Pettway slave called Ottaway.\"<ref name=\":0\" /></blockquote>Bennett's family home did not receive running water or paved roads until 1975, when she was 15 years old. Previously, the family would haul water buckets from neighbors' homes or nearby wells and springs. Gee's Bend schools went through [[Desegregation in the United States|desegregation]] in Bennett's seventh grade year, and were shut down shortly thereafter. In order to continue her education, Bennett was required to take a crowded school bus two hours each morning and night to reach schools in neighboring counties. This arduous trek made participating in extracurricular activities nearly impossible. Nonetheless, Bennett graduated and married her high school sweetheart, Lovett \"Bennett\" Bennett on July 7, 1979.<ref name=\":0\" /> \n\nBennett's husband enlisted in the U.S. Army immediately after graduation, and they spent the next twenty years moving with the military. During her husband's military career, Bennett and her family lived in various cities in Germany, El Paso, Texas, and Georgia. While living in Germany and Texas, Bennett and her family traveled throughout Europe and the American southwest.  They raised three boys and eventually settled down again in Gee's Bend, Alabama after Bennett's grandmother, Candis Pettway, died in 1998.<ref name=\":0\" /> \n\n== Career ==\nBennett was introduced to the quilting tradition, when she was five or six years old, although \"At that age we were only allowed to thread the needles for the quilters in my grandmother\u2019s and my mother\u2019s quilting group.\" Every summer, her mother and aunts would train more sewing into her skill set, little by little. Her first completed quilt was a baby blanket, which was a Home Economics' project for her Home Economic's teacher's arriving grandchild. \n\nThroughout her travels in Europe and the American Southwest, Bennett always marveled at each culture's distinct use of color. In regards to Germany, she noted that \"The Germans were not big on having a lot of different colors, especially not on their houses, cars, and clothing, compared to Americans. But in the springtime things were different. I got to see another side of Germany, as many houses were decorated with flower boxes of red geraniums and pansies sitting on the window ledges, with white and black-trimmed houses in the background.\"<ref name=\":0\" /> Some of her pieces, such as her early 2000s, duo-tone blocks and strips works, remind the viewer of [[Bauhaus]] ways of color usage, or the organization of [[Piet Mondrian|Piet Mondrien.]] She exchanged craft traditions with local Germans often, recalling that her neighbors taught her to knit and she sold a few of her mother's quilts among her friends in Germany.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nTruly understanding the depth of Gee's Bend's quilts national importance overwhelmed Bennett when she first saw the quilts displayed at the Houston Museum of Fine Art in 2002.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.soulsgrowndeep.org/exhibition/quilts-gees-bend|title=The Quilts of Gee's Bend {{!}} Souls Grown Deep Foundation|website=www.soulsgrowndeep.org|access-date=2019-06-12}}</ref> She describes that moment as, \"There my eyes were opened, and it touched me in a way as to question myself: Can I make a quilt that someday might hang on the wall of a museum?\"<ref name=\":0\" />  Determined to carry on her ancestor's legacies, Bennett applied for and received a fellowship grant from the Alabama State Archive Council on the Arts to study the fine details of Gee's bend quilt-making. From this fellowship, her and her mother created a \"Pine Burr\" quilt, the state quilt of Alabama.

Pettway. She and her siblings frequently worked on her grandfather, Tank Pettway's, farm growing cotton, corn, peanuts, and sweet potatoes, among other crops. Bennett remarks on the naming traditions of Gee's Bend using her family as an example: <blockquote>\"Aunt Lucy was the sister of my father, Tom O. Pettway, Jr. An interesting thing is that Aunt Lucy\u2019s middle name was Tomo. Because so many people in Gee\u2019s Bend have the name of Pettway, people get middle names that let others know who their fathers are, so nobody marries a close cousin by mistake. My father and his father carry the middle initial O. for Ottaway, a name that goes back to an original Pettway slave called Ottaway.\"<ref name=\":0\" /></blockquote>Bennett's family home did not receive running water or paved roads until 1975, when she was 15 years old. Previously, the family would haul water buckets from neighbors' homes or nearby wells and springs. Gee's Bend schools went through [[Desegregation in the United States|desegregation]] in Bennett's seventh grade year, and were shut down shortly thereafter. In order to continue her education, Bennett was required to take a crowded school bus two hours each morning and night to reach schools in neighboring counties. This arduous trek made participating in extracurricular activities nearly impossible. Nonetheless, Bennett graduated and married her high school sweetheart, Lovett \"Bennett\" Bennett on July 7, 1979.<ref name=\":0\" /> \n\nBennett's husband enlisted in the U.S. Army immediately after graduation, and they spent the next twenty years moving with the military. During her husband's military career, Bennett and her family lived in various cities in Germany, El Paso, Texas, and Georgia. While living in Germany and Texas, Bennett and her family traveled throughout Europe and the American southwest.  They raised three boys and eventually settled down again in Gee's Bend, Alabama after Bennett's grandmother, Candis Pettway, died in 1998.<ref name=\":0\" /> \n\n== Career ==\nBennett was introduced to the quilting tradition, when she was five or six years old, although \"At that age we were only allowed to thread the needles for the quilters in my grandmother\u2019s and my mother\u2019s quilting group.\" Every summer, her mother and aunts would train more sewing into her skill set, little by little. Her first completed quilt was a baby blanket, which was a Home Economics' project for her Home Economic's teacher's arriving grandchild. \n\nThroughout her travels in Europe and the American Southwest, Bennett always marveled at each culture's distinct use of color. In regards to Germany, she noted that \"The Germans were not big on having a lot of different colors, especially not on their houses, cars, and clothing, compared to Americans. But in the springtime things were different. I got to see another side of Germany, as many houses were decorated with flower boxes of red geraniums and pansies sitting on the window ledges, with white and black-trimmed houses in the background.\"<ref name=\":0\" /> Some of her pieces, such as her early 2000's, duo-tone blocks and strips works, remind the viewer of [[Bauhaus]] ways of color usage, or the organization of [[Piet Mondrian|Piet Mondrien.]] She exchanged craft traditions with local Germans often, recalling that her neighbors taught her to knit and she sold a few of her mother's quilts among her friends in Germany.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nTruly understanding the depth of Gee's Bend's quilts national importance overwhelmed Bennett when she first saw the quilts displayed at the Houston Museum of Fine Art in 2002.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.soulsgrowndeep.org/exhibition/quilts-gees-bend|title=The Quilts of Gee's Bend {{!}} Souls Grown Deep Foundation|website=www.soulsgrowndeep.org|access-date=2019-06-12}}</ref> She describes that moment as, \"There my eyes were opened, and it touched me in a way as to question myself: Can I make a quilt that someday might hang on the wall of a museum?\"<ref name=\":0\" />  Determined to carry on her ancestor's legacies, Bennett applied for and received a fellowship grant from the Alabama State Archive Council on the Arts to study the fine details of Gee's bend quilt-making. From this fellowship, her and her mother created a \"Pine Burr\" quilt, the state quilt of Alabama. Bennett donated this quilt to the Alabama Council of the Arts, where it now hangs on the walls of the Alabama Department of Archives and History.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.archives.alabama.gov/emblems/st_quilt.html|title=Alabama Department of Archives and History, Official Emblems--Pineburr Quilt|website=www.archives.alabama.gov|access-date=2019-06-12}}</ref> \n\nShe is a prolific artist and culture-bearer, dedicated to propagating her community's traditions for future generations. \n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Quilters of Gee's Bend}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Bennett, Loretta Pettway}}\n[[Category:Quilters]]\n[[Category:African-American artists]]\n[[Category:Artists from Alabama]]\n[[Category:21st-century women artists]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:1960 births]]\n\n{{US-artist-stub}}\n", "name_user": "Alistair1978", "label": "safe", "comment": "typo (viaWP:JWB)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loretta_Pettway_Bennett"}

At the age of eighteen Mubarik began to break away from religion due to contradictions between the teachings of the [[Quran|Qu'ran]] and the way people practice the religion. At first he attempted to practice [[Quranism|Qu'ranism]], but eventually he began to pursue more scientific thought and is no longer religious. However, Mubarik states that Islam still influences him and his music to an extent.<ref name=\":55\" />\n\nMubarik grew up in a \"very working class background, which has obviously shaped a lot of [his] political leanings\". He has repeatedly expressed anti-capitalist sentiment on various interviews and is a self-described [[Marxist-Leninist-Maoist|Marxist-Lenninist-Maoist]]. His political leanings have heavily influenced his musical content, which can be seen most clearly on ''Ilah''.\n\nMubarik's political views have influenced his nationality, which he expressed on his podcast by saying that, \"I was born and live in a place that most people call Canada, which is a [[Settler colonialism|settler-colonial]] state. But I prefer to call it [[Turtle Island (North America)|Turtle Island]]. I usually never call myself Canadian, but just consider myself to be [[African Americans|African]]\"\n\nMubarik moved to Edmonton in the spring of 2019.\n\n== Politics and Podcast ==\n\n=== Political Activism and Organizing ===\nOn October 3, 2016 Mubarik was walking in downtown [[Hamilton, Ontario|Hamilton]] when he witnessed an altercation. A white woman was attempting to physically harm a black taxi driver while yelling obscenities, including the [[N-word]] and the phrase \"go back to Africa\". Mubarik videotaped the incident and posted it on Facebook where he commented on the event saying, \"Racism is 100 per cent intertwined with [[capitalism]] and overall inequality\". The woman has since been investigated by the [[Hamilton Police Service|Hamilton Police Hate Crime Unit]] and the woman has been charged with assault.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Carter|first=Adam|url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/hamilton/woman-calls-cab-driver-n-ger-during-altercation-caught-on-tape-1.3791516|title=Woman calls cab driver n\u2014ger during altercation caught on tape|date=October 4, 2016|publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|access-date=February 16, 2020|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161008130145/https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/hamilton/woman-calls-cab-driver-n-ger-during-altercation-caught-on-tape-1.3791516|archive-date=October 8, 2016}}</ref><ref name=\":4\">{{Cite web|url=http://cutfromsteel.com/emay-bakkah-the-history-of-humankind/|title=Emay \u2013 Bakkah: The History of Humankind|last=Njegovan|first=Biljana|date=October 28, 2016|website=Cut From Steel|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200225205419/http://cutfromsteel.com/emay-bakkah-the-history-of-humankind/|archive-date=February 25, 2020|access-date=February 16, 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe first [[Marxism|Marxist]] organization that Mubarik became involved in was called the Young Communist League a revisionist group in Canada where Mubarik met some members of the [[Revolutionary Communist Party of Canada|PCR-RCP]]. This would lead to Mubarik eventually support the [[Revolutionary Communist Party of Canada|PCR-RCP]] and a more [[Revolutionary|revolutionary ideology]]. Mubarik has also been involved with the [[Hamilton, Ontario|Hamilton]]-based [[Marxism\u2013Leninism|Marxist-Lenninist]] organization called [[Serve the People]].\n\n=== On Mass ===\n\nOn January 16, 2018 Mubarik released the first episode of his podcast entitled ''On Mass''. In the episode, Mubarik explains that his \"goal with this podcast is to basically interpret global and local events through a revolutionary communist perspective or lens and emphasize the importance of revolution for workers and basically oppressed people all over the world if you want to see actual fundamental change.\" When describing his political leanings on the episode Mubarik stated that \"politically speaking I refer to myself as a [[Maoism|Maoist]] and I'm a supporter of the [[Revolutionary Communist Party of Canada]] known as the [[PCR-RCP]] more particularly I adhere to [[Marxism\u2013Leninism\u2013Maoism]] ideologically\"\n\nIn the sixth episode, released June 8, 2019, Mubarik mentions that he \"started a new website entitled 'leftistaudiobooks.com' and this is basically just me trying to spread more revolutionary ideas and things like that and making it more accessible because I know a lot of people listen to audiobooks and I listen to audiobooks a lot while I'm working and things like that so that's why I wanted to start this project.\" The website currently only has a single book available entitled [[Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism|Imperialism the Highest Stage of Capitalism]] by [[Vladimir Lenin|Vladimir Ilyich Lenin]].\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+List of On Mass Episodes\n!Episode No.\n!Title\n!Guests\n!Original Air Date\n!Notes\n|-\n|1\n|Marxism-Leninism-Maoism with J.

The episode was entitled \"On Mass: Maoism, Hip Hop, & Black Panther\". The episode cites Maoist Rebel News\u2014a small news site and blog run by Jason Unruhe\u2014as a bad representation of [[Maoism]]. The episode features songs from Emay's album ''Ilah'' including \"Lilac (feat. Kamilah and L-SPEX)\" and \"Israfil 'angels trumpet'\" as well as an unreleased song entitled \"Volunteer\". Mubarik states that the biggest misconceptions concerning [[Maoism]] is the conflation of [[Marxism\u2013Leninism\u2013Maoism]] with [[Mao-Zedong-Thought|Mao Zedong Thought]], the dogmatic view that everything [[Mao Zedong|Mao]] said is correct and representative of [[Maoism]], and that a [[Cultural Revolution]] is not necessary. Mubarik cites the [[Black Power movement]], The Revolutionary Internationalist Movement, and [[Shining Path|The Shining Path]] as some of the first and imperfect examples of attempting to implement Marxism\u2013Leninism\u2013Maoism and cites the book entitled The Unknown Cultural Revolution written by Dongping Han as a good source for understanding the [[Cultural Revolution]]. The episode spends some time discussing the [[Black Panther Party]] and its attempt at implementing [[Marxism\u2013Leninism\u2013Maoism|Marxism-Leninnism-Maoism]] in the 1960s and how the [[Black Panther (film)|Black Pather Movie]] was not representative of the party or the ideology. On the episode, Breht O'Shea claims that there is a direct historical lineage from [[Malcolm X]] to the [[Black Panther Party]] to [[Hip hop]], which Mubarik agreed with and expanded on.\n\n== Discography ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Full-Length Albums\n!Title\n!Album Details\n|-\n|Ilah\n|\n* Released: February 24, 2017\n* Label: Jet Jam, Tomorrow Archaic\n* Format: digital download, [[Streaming media|streaming]]\n|-\n|Adam\n|\n*Released: April 6, 2012\n* Label: Tomorrow Archaic\n* Format: digital download\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+'''Extended Plays'''\n!Title\n!Details\n|-\n|Sinner, Song-Writer\n|\n* Released: December 16, 2014\n* Label: [[Last Gang Records|Last Gang Records, Inc.]] / Hi-Scores Recording Library\n* Format: digital download, [[Cassette tape|cassette]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://hiscoresrecordinglibrary.com/releases/emay/|title=EMAY {{!}} Hi-Scores Website|date=April 30, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150430100257/http://hiscoresrecordinglibrary.com/releases/emay/|access-date=February 17, 2020|archive-date=April 30, 2015}}</ref> [[Streaming media|streaming]]\n|-\n|Into It\n|\n* Released: October 30, 2012\n* Label: Potholes Music\n* Format: digital download, [[Streaming media|streaming]]\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Mixtapes\n!Title\n!Details\n|-\n|Incorruptible\n|\n*Released: March 21, 2011\n* Label: Self-released\n* Format: digital download\n|-\n|Mind Altering Dynamics (Instrumentals)\n|\n*Released: January 18, 2011\n* Label: Self-released\n* Format: digital download\n|-\n|Mind Altering Dynamics\n|\n* Released: January 18, 2011\n* Label: Self-released\n* Format: digital download\n|-\n|Emay, Karen O, and the Kids\n|\n* Released: April 26, 2010\n* Label: Self-released\n* Format: digital download\n|-\n|A.D.D.

His legal last name Gyenne-Adams came from the first name of his paternal uncle Adam, and his preferred last name Gyenne-Bayere is reflective of the clans his parents came from within the [[Bissa people|Bissa ethnic group]] of West Africa. He and his four sisters were raised in a [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] [[Muslims|Muslim]] household by his single mother. According to Mubarik's song titled \"Because Winter (feat. Lowell Boland)\", he was four years old when his father passed away. The family regularly moved between shelters throughout [[Ontario]]. As a child he attended Gateway Public Elementary School while living in [[Toronto]] before moving to Port Credit where he attended Riverside Public Elementary School. He lived in [[Brampton]] briefly where he attended [[Bramalea Secondary School]] before settling in [[Hamilton, Ontario|Hamilton]] where he attended [[Glendale Secondary School]].\n\nAccording to Emay he \"spent most of his childhood living in the Vendome patch of [[Flemingdon Park]], Toronto, Ontario, Canada, and then later moved to [[Brampton|Brampton, Ontario]] when he was in grade 5. Mubarik was first exposed to [[Hip hop|hip-hop]] when his immigrant cousin Nasara would constantly listen to [[Nas]] while living in the Vendome residence. His mother would listen to a lot of [[West African music|West African]], [[Reggae]], [[Disco]], Pop, [[Country music|Country]], [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]], and [[religious music]]. Emay was a huge fan of [[Eminem]] and [[Dr. Dre]] when he was in elementary school, and would stick tissue into his mothers [[cassette tape]]s to record their music off of the radio. After Mubarik moved to [[Brampton]] in grade 5, he was no longer a fan of [[Hip hop|hip-hop]] as much and would recreate melodies on his sisters digital [[MIDI keyboard]]. He also began listening to [[jazz]] and classical music from the radio. When he reached grade 8, he became intrigued with [[Southern hip hop|southern hip-hop]], and was a big fan of [[T.I.]]'s [[Grand Hustle Records|Grand Hustle label]], and artists like [[Jeezy|Young Jeezy]], [[UGK]], and [[Boosie Badazz|Lil' Boosie]]. As he progressed through high school he began listening to more [[Old-school hip hop|old school]] and [[Underground hip hop|underground hip-hop]] acts such as [[Jedi Mind Tricks]], [[O.C. (rapper)|OC]], [[AZ (rapper)|AZ]], [[Showbiz and A.G.|Showbiz & A.G.]], and [[MF Doom]]. In 2006, he began creating instrumentals in [[FL Studio]] in attempt to mimic his favourite producers and artists. Mubarik learned how to create instrumentals in [[FL Studio]] after his online mentors Lion and Gravity gave him tips and advice. His online mentors also assisted him with his [[rapping]] as well. As he completed high school, he began listening to a lot more different genres including Classical, [[Classic rock music|Classic Rock]], [[Grunge]], [[Emo]], [[Alternative Music|Alternative]], [[Punk rock|Punk]], [[Soul music|Soul]], [[Ambient music|Ambient]], and more.\"\n\n== Career ==\n\n=== 2006\u20132013: Career Beginnings ===\nThe mixtape was also promoted by the music blog and independent record label Vinyl Meltdown.

However, Mubarik states that Islam still influences him and his music to an extent.<ref name=\":55\" />\n\nMubarik grew up in a \"very working class background, which has obviously shaped a lot of [his] political leanings\". He has repeatedly expressed anti-capitalist sentiment on various interviews and is a self-described [[Marxist-Leninist-Maoist|Marxist-Lenninist-Maoist]]. His political leanings have heavily influenced his musical content, which can be seen most clearly on ''Ilah''.\n\nMubarik's political views have influenced his nationality, which he expressed on his podcast by saying that, \"I was born and live in a place that most people call Canada, which is a [[Settler colonialism|settler-colonial]] state. But I prefer to call it [[Turtle Island (North America)|Turtle Island]]. I usually never call myself Canadian, but just consider myself to be [[African Americans|African]]\"\n\nMubarik moved to Edmonton in the spring of 2019.\n\n== Politics and Podcast ==\n\n=== Political Activism and Organizing ===\nOn October 3, 2016 Mubarik was walking in downtown [[Hamilton, Ontario|Hamilton]] when he witnessed an altercation. A white woman was attempting to physically harm a black taxi driver while yelling obscenities, including the [[N-word]] and the phrase \"go back to Africa\". Mubarik videotaped the incident and posted it on Facebook where he commented on the event saying, \"Racism is 100 per cent intertwined with [[capitalism]] and overall inequality\". The woman has since been investigated by the [[Hamilton Police Service|Hamilton Police Hate Crime Unit]] and the woman has been charged with assault.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Carter|first=Adam|url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/hamilton/woman-calls-cab-driver-n-ger-during-altercation-caught-on-tape-1.3791516|title=Woman calls cab driver n\u2014ger during altercation caught on tape|date=October 4, 2016|publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|access-date=February 16, 2020|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161008130145/https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/hamilton/woman-calls-cab-driver-n-ger-during-altercation-caught-on-tape-1.3791516|archive-date=October 8, 2016}}</ref><ref name=\":4\">{{Cite web|url=http://cutfromsteel.com/emay-bakkah-the-history-of-humankind/|title=Emay \u2013 Bakkah: The History of Humankind|last=Njegovan|first=Biljana|date=October 28, 2016|website=Cut From Steel|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200225205419/http://cutfromsteel.com/emay-bakkah-the-history-of-humankind/|archive-date=February 25, 2020|access-date=February 16, 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe first [[Marxism|Marxist]] organization that Mubarik became involved in was called the Young Communist League a revisionist group in Canada where Mubarik met some members of the [[Revolutionary Communist Party of Canada|PCR-RCP]]. This would lead to Mubarik eventually support the [[Revolutionary Communist Party of Canada|PCR-RCP]] and a more [[Revolutionary|revolutionary ideology]]. Mubarik has also been involved with the [[Hamilton, Ontario|Hamilton]]-based [[Marxism\u2013Leninism|Marxist-Lenninist]] organization called [[Serve the People]].\n\n=== On Mass ===\n\nOn January 16, 2018 Mubarik released the first episode of his podcast entitled ''On Mass''. In the episode, Mubarik explains that his \"goal with this podcast is to basically interpret global and local events through a revolutionary communist perspective or lens and emphasize the importance of revolution for workers and basically oppressed people all over the world if you want to see actual fundamental change.\" When describing his political leanings on the episode Mubarik stated that \"politically speaking I refer to myself as a [[Maoism|Maoist]] and I'm a supporter of the [[Revolutionary Communist Party of Canada]] known as the [[PCR-RCP]] more particularly I adhere to [[Marxism\u2013Leninism\u2013Maoism]] ideologically\"\n\nIn the sixth episode, released June 8, 2019, Mubarik mentions that he \"started a new website entitled 'leftistaudiobooks.com' and this is basically just me trying to spread more revolutionary ideas and things like that and making it more accessible because I know a lot of people listen to audiobooks and I listen to audiobooks a lot while I'm working and things like that so that's why I wanted to start this project.\" The website currently only has a single book available entitled [[Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism|Imperialism the Highest Stage of Capitalism]] by [[Vladimir Lenin|Vladimir Ilyich Lenin]].\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+List of On Mass Episodes\n!Episode No.\n!Title\n!Guests\n!Original Air Date\n!Notes\n|-\n|1\n|Marxism-Leninism-Maoism with J.

The episode was entitled \"On Mass: Maoism, Hip Hop, & Black Panther\". The episode cites Maoist Rebel News\u2014a small news site and blog run by Jason Unruhe\u2014as a bad representation of [[Maoism]]. The episode features songs from Emay's album ''Ilah'' including \"Lilac (feat. Kamilah and L-SPEX)\" and \"Israfil 'angels trumpet'\" as well as an unreleased song entitled \"Volunteer\". Mubarik states that the biggest misconceptions concerning [[Maoism]] is the conflation of [[Marxism\u2013Leninism\u2013Maoism]] with [[Mao-Zedong-Thought|Mao Zedong Thought]], the dogmatic view that everything [[Mao Zedong|Mao]] said is correct and representative of [[Maoism]], and that a [[Cultural Revolution]] is not necessary. Mubarik cites the [[Black Power movement]], The Revolutionary Internationalist Movement, and [[Shining Path|The Shining Path]] as some of the first and imperfect examples of attempting to implement Marxism\u2013Leninism\u2013Maoism and cites the book entitled The Unknown Cultural Revolution written by Dongping Han as a good source for understanding the [[Cultural Revolution]]. The episode spends some time discussing the [[Black Panther Party]] and its attempt at implementing [[Marxism\u2013Leninism\u2013Maoism|Marxism-Leninnism-Maoism]] in the 1960s and how the [[Black Panther (film)|Black Pather Movie]] was not representative of the party or the ideology. On the episode, Breht O'Shea claims that there is a direct historical lineage from [[Malcolm X]] to the [[Black Panther Party]] to [[Hip hop]], which Mubarik agreed with and expanded on.\n\n== Discography ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Full-Length Albums\n!Title\n!Album Details\n|-\n|Ilah\n|\n* Released: February 24, 2017\n* Label: Jet Jam, Tomorrow Archaic\n* Format: digital download, [[Streaming media|streaming]]\n|-\n|Adam\n|\n*Released: April 6, 2012\n* Label: Tomorrow Archaic\n* Format: digital download\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+'''Extended Plays'''\n!Title\n!Details\n|-\n|Sinner, Song-Writer\n|\n* Released: December 16, 2014\n* Label: [[Last Gang Records|Last Gang Records, Inc.]] / Hi-Scores Recording Library\n* Format: digital download, [[Cassette tape|cassette]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://hiscoresrecordinglibrary.com/releases/emay/|title=EMAY {{!}} Hi-Scores Website|date=April 30, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150430100257/http://hiscoresrecordinglibrary.com/releases/emay/|access-date=February 17, 2020|archive-date=April 30, 2015}}</ref> [[Streaming media|streaming]]\n|-\n|Into It\n|\n* Released: October 30, 2012\n* Label: Potholes Music\n* Format: digital download, [[Streaming media|streaming]]\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Mixtapes\n!Title\n!Details\n|-\n|Incorruptible\n|\n*Released: March 21, 2011\n* Label: Self-released\n* Format: digital download\n|-\n|Mind Altering Dynamics (Instrumentals)\n|\n*Released: January 18, 2011\n* Label: Self-released\n* Format: digital download\n|-\n|Mind Altering Dynamics\n|\n* Released: January 18, 2011\n* Label: Self-released\n* Format: digital download\n|-\n|Emay, Karen O, and the Kids\n|\n* Released: April 26, 2010\n* Label: Self-released\n* Format: digital download\n|-\n|A.D.D.
