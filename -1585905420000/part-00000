SuperLiga]] club [[FK Hajduk Kula|Hajduk Kula]] went defunct thus leaving an empty place in [[2013\u201314 Serbian SuperLiga]]. On an urgent meeting in [[Football Association of Serbia]], it was ruled that 3rd placed team from [[2012\u201313 Serbian First League]] should be promoted to [[Serbian SuperLiga]]. It was also announced that, due to shortage of time until the beginning of the season, 13th placed team from [[2012\u201313 Serbian First League|last season]] is going to stay in the league for the current season. Formally, that meant that [[FK Vo\u017edovac|Vo\u017edovac]] was promoted and [[FK Teleoptik|Teleoptik]] stayed in the league.\n\n==League table==\n{{#invoke:sports

It was also announced that, due to shortage of time until the beginning of the season, 13th placed team from [[2012\u201313 Serbian First League|last season]] is going to stay in the league for the current season.

Tracks often feature [[steel-string acoustic guitar|acoustic guitar]] and [[accordion]], with some containing other traditional instruments such as [[piano]] and [[brass instrument|brass]]. The group's style is fairly upbeat and energetic on the majority of its tracks, with unusual rhythms, vocals delivered with a generous dose of zeal and vibrant energy, and accompaniment melodies ranging from lilting and distant to eccentric and fast-paced.

The original line-up included singer [[Helno]] (also known as Helno Rota de Lourcqua, born No\u00ebl Rota), Jo Roz (also known as l'Ami Ro; real name Joe Ruffier des Aimes) (piano), St\u00e9fane Mellino (guitar), Jean-Marie Paulus (bass), Gaby (drums), Matthias Canavese (accordion), Michel Ochowiak (trumpet), Abraham Sirinix (also known as Abraham Braham) (trombone), and Iza Mellino (backing vocals). \n\nThe original members were a group of friends, many of whom had not played their instruments before forming the band. The group's name translates as ''green [[:wiki:negress|negresses]]''; and  arose from abuse hurled at the members at one of the group's first concerts. The insult is a comparison to the kitsch art of [[Vladimir Tretchikoff]].

Their second album, ''Famille Nombreuse'', in 1991, featured new drummer Z\u00e9 Verbalito. \n\nIn 1990, Les N\u00e9gresses Vertes contributed the song \"I love Paris\" to the [[Cole Porter]] tribute album ''\"[[Red Hot + Blue]]\"'', which was produced by the [[Red Hot Organization]].\n\nHelno was by this time struggling with serious heroin addiction, and St\u00e9fane Mellino and Canavese replaced him as the main songwriters. Helno died at his parents' house on January 22, 1993. \n\nSeveral members left the band after Helno's death, but Les N\u00e9gresses Vertes continued around the nucleus of Mellino, Canavese, Ochowiak, and Paulus.

The [[World Snooker Championships]] has been held at the [[Crucible Theatre]] since 1977.\n\n==History==\n\n=== Early sport===\nThe earliest reference to cricket involving Sheffield was a match between Sheffield and Nottingham in 1771.<ref name=\"FirstCricket\">[http://myweb.tiscali.co.uk/sherwoodtimes/cricket.htm Bygone cricket] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051224180418/http://myweb.tiscali.co.uk/sherwoodtimes/cricket.htm |date=24 December 2005 }} (last accessed 4 August 2006)</ref>\nThe first recorded game of football in Sheffield was played in 1793 between Sheffield and [[Norton, Sheffield, South Yorkshire|Norton]] (a village in [[Derbyshire]] at the time but now a suburb of Sheffield).  The game initially started as six a side but numbers swelled after both sides called for reinforcements. It continued for 3 days after which it descended into a general row.<ref name=\"Football in Sheffield\">Percy M. Young (1962), ''Football in Sheffield'', S. Paul</ref>\n\n[[Hallam Cricket Club]] was formed in 1804 and started using land in [[Sandygate]] as their ground. It continues to be used to this day and is acknowledged as the oldest ground in the world. [[Sheffield Wednesday Cricket Club]] was formed in 1820. The first cricket match between Yorkshire and Lancashire took place at [[Hyde Park, South Yorkshire|Hyde Park]] in 1949.\n\n===Birth of football===\nBy the 1850s the city had several cricket clubs, the matches mainly being played during the summer. Nathaniel Creswick and William Prest wanted to start a team that could keep the players together during the winter and formed [[Sheffield F.C.]] In 1857 they decided to write the first rule book for football called [[Sheffield Rules]]. By 1860 there were 15 football clubs in the city.\n\n[[Sheffield United Cricket Club]] was formed in 1854, so called because it was made up of the uniting of several local sides. It was the first club to be named United. The [[Bramall Lane]] ground was built a year later. [[Yorkshire County Cricket Club]] was also formed in the city in 1863.\n\nThe teams continued to play under the Sheffield Rules after the formation of the [[The Football Association|FA]] known locally as the ''London FA''. They formed their own association in 1867 and played the first ever competitive football competition, the [[Youdan Cup]], in the same year. Another significant event was the formation of [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]] football club.\n\nThe first inter-association football match between [[Sheffield and Hallamshire Football Association|Sheffield FA]] and London (the FA) was played at Bramall lane. Sheffield won the match 3\u20131. Many such matches were played during the 1870s with the home side dictating which rules they should play under. This eventually led to a merger of the two set of rules in 1878.\n\n===Decline of cricket, rise of football===\n[[Sheffield United F.C.]] were formed in 1889. In the same year Sheffield Wednesday turned professional and applied for membership of [[the Football League]]. This was denied so they became founding members of the [[Football Alliance]] and won its competition in the first season. Both the clubs were accepted into the Football League in 1892. Wednesday into division 1 and United into the newly formed second division.\n\nAt the turn of the century the city enjoyed huge success starting with Sheffield Wednesday winning the [[FA Cup]] in 1896. United then won the league in 1898, the FA Cup the following year, and again in 1902. Wednesday then won the league twice in a row in 1903/4 and 1904/5. Sheffield F.C. also won their first cup, the [[FA Amateur Cup]], in 1904.\n\nMeanwhile, cricket in the city was in decline. Yorkshire CCC moved its headquarters to [[Headingley Stadium|Headingley]], [[Leeds]] in 1893. Although Bramall Lane hosted its first test match in 1912, the experiment was seen as a disaster and was never repeated. England lost to Australia, which was blamed on poor light conditions caused by the heavy air pollution which used to plague the city. Sheffield Wednesday cricket club ceased to exist in 1925 due to a lack of players.\n\nThe following decades saw intermittent success for both clubs, including another brace of league titles for Wednesday in 1928\u20131930. The last FA Cup win for a Sheffield club was in 1935 by Wednesday.\n\n===Post war years===\nBoth clubs then went into decline after the Second World War. Wednesday sank to the third division in 1974 and United were relegated as far as the fourth division by 1981. Cricket matches, at a national level, ceased altogether in the city 1973 when the last county match was played at Bramall Lane.\n\nIn 1989, Sheffield Wednesday's home ground of [[Hillsborough Stadium|Hillsborough]] was the scene of a tragedy when 96 Liverpool fans were crushed to death during an FA Cup semifinal in the infamous [[Hillsborough disaster]]. This prompted a series of safety improvements at football grounds around the country, with terraced stands converted to all seated accommodation.\n\nThe early 1990s saw an upsurge in the fortunes of both clubs starting with Wednesday winning the [[Football League Cup|League Cup]] in 1991. The two teams then met in the FA Cup semi-final in 1993. Wednesday won the match 2\u20131 but went on to lose both the final and League Cup final, both to [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]], during which season the Owls visited Wembley four times. Both teams, however, began to lose fortune as the decade progressed and were both relegated from the top fight; United in 1994, and Wednesday in 2000. The Blades hovered in the second tier for more than 10 years, until they briefly re-entered the Premier League for the 2006\u201307 season, but were relegated straight back down after an unsuccessful campaign accumulating only 38 points.\n\nWednesday's performance in the first decade of the 21st century has been arguably the worst in the club's history; following relegation from the Premier League in 2000 they were further relegated to the third tier in 2003. The Owls came back to the Championship in 2005 via the League One Play-offs, but after a five season spell in the Championship, the club again found themselves back down in the third tier for the 2010\u201311 season.\n\nUnited were also relegated to League One in time for the 2011\u201312 season, a season in which both clubs contested to get out of the division, with Wednesday being victorious in the end finishing in second place to return to the Championship. United contested the play-offs, but lost in the final to [[Huddersfield Town F.C|Huddersfield]].\nIn the 2010s, Sheffield Wednesday have once again been the more successful of the two Sheffield Clubs, having regained promotion to the Championship in 2012, whilst Sheffield United continue to compete in League One, on the back of three unsuccessful play-off campaigns over four seasons.\n\nSheffield was briefly home to a third [[Football League]] club from 2008 to 2012 when [[Rotherham United]] played their home matches at [[Don Valley Stadium]], following a dispute with the owner of their [[Millmoor]] ground. Rotherham moved back to their hometown in 2012 following the completion of the [[New York Stadium]]\n\n==Football==\nThere are two [[Local derby|derbies]] played in the city. Sheffield United and Wednesday contest the [[Steel City Derby]] in the league or sometimes as a pre-season friendly if they are not in the same division. Hallam F.C. and Sheffield F.C. still play the world's oldest derby. They are currently both in the [[Northern Counties East League]] Premier Division.\n\n===Existing Clubs===\n*[[Hallam F.C.]]\n*[[Sheffield F.C.]]\n*[[Sheffield United F.C.]]\n*[[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.]]\n*[[Stocksbridge Park Steels F.C.]]\n\n==Cricket==\nSheffield still has a number of local cricket teams, including Sheffield United Cricket Club, Shiregreen Cricket Club, Hallam Cricket Club and [[Sheffield Collegiate CC]]. Most of which play in the [[South Yorkshire Cricket League]].\n\n==Ice hockey==\n[[Sheffield Steelers]] are an [[ice hockey]] team who play their home matches at [[Sheffield Arena]]. They were formed in 1991 and rapidly rose up the leagues to the [[British Elite Ice Hockey League|British Premier League]] (now called the Elite League). They then won the championship in their second season and again in their third. In total they have won the top flight title 4 times.\n\nThe city also has a several other ice hockey teams (in fact, Sheffield has more senior-level ice hockey teams than any other UK city). The [[Sheffield Steeldogs]] play in the second-tier English Premier League and the [[Sheffield Senators]] and [[Sheffield Spartans]] play in the third-tier National Ice Hockey League North. The [[Sheffield Shadows]] compete in the Women's Premier League and the [[Sheffield Ice Tigers]] play recreational level hockey. All of these teams play out of Ice Sheffield.\n\n==Basketball==\n[[Sheffield Sharks]] are a professional [[basketball]] team who play at [[English Institute of Sport (Sheffield)|English Institute of Sport]]. They were formed in 1994 and won the [[British Basketball League]] in their first season. They have won it a total of 3 times.  The [[City of Sheffield Arrows]] play in the [[English Basketball League]], as do the [[Sheffield Sabres Basketball|Sheffield Sabres]] and the Sheffield Saints.  The Arrows and the Sabres play home games at the [[English Institute of Sport (Sheffield)|English Institute of Sport]] whereas the Saints play at All Saints School. [[Sheffield Hatters]] are a women's basketball team who also play at All Saints. They have dominated the National League winning it every year from 1991 to 2002. However, other teams have caught up in recent years.  Both Sheffield University and Sheffield Hallam University have basketball teams and SHU has produced many good BUCS (British Universities and College Sports) basketball teams over the years reaching the national finals several times. Many SHU players have gone on to play on in other high-level basketball leagues around the country.\n\n==Boxing==\nSheffield has enjoyed huge success in [[boxing]] mainly due to the [[Wincobank]] gym run by [[Brendan Ingle]]. During the 1990s several world champions were produced including [[Naseem Hamed]], [[Herol Graham]], [[Johnny Nelson]] and [[Paul Jones (boxer)|Paul Jones]]. Sheffield continued to produce world champions in the 2000s with the likes of [[Clinton Woods]], [[Junior Witter]], and [[Kell Brook]].\n\n==Other sports==\nOther notable clubs are the [[Sheffield Eagles]] [[rugby league]] club based at [[Don Valley Stadium]] who won the Rugby League [[Challenge Cup]] in 1998. \n[[Sheffield Tigers]] is a local [[motorcycle speedway|speedway]] team based at [[Owlerton Stadium]]. Speedway arrived at [[Owlerton]] in Sheffield in 1929 and a team took part in league speedway for a number of the pre-war seasons. The track re-opened in 1945 for a couple of meetings and the re-formed Tigers raced in the Northern League of 1946 and the National League Division Two 1947 \u2013 1950. (In part of 1950 the team were known as The Tars.) In 1951 the promotion failed after competing in the Division Two Regional competition and a few open meetings were staged in 1952. \nThe Tigers were revivied as members of the Provincial League in 1960 and have featured in league speedway most seasons since that date. The propmotion also staged speedway at Conference League level with the team known as the Owlerton Prowlers. \nNamesake [[Sheffield Tigers RUFC|Sheffield Tigers]], of the speedway team, and [[Sheffield RUFC]] are local [[Rugby Union]] sides based at [[Dore]].  In 2005 the city hosted the finish of Stage 3 of the [[Tour of Britain]] cycle race. In 2004 and 2005 the city also played host to the start and finish of the Roger Albert Clark Rally.\n\n[[Sheffield Volleyball Club]] was founded in 1989 and runs men's and women's performance teams as well as providing opportunities for junior players.\n\nThe {{SBK|2004}} and {{SBK|2007}} [[List of Superbike World champions|Superbike World Champion]], [[James Toseland]], comes from Sheffield, as does the climber [[Joe Simpson (mountaineer)|Joe Simpson]].\n\nThe 2012 Men's Doubles Wimbledon champion [[Jonathan Marray]] lives in Sheffield, playing at the Hallamshire Tennis Club.\n\nThe [[City of Sheffield Athletic Club]] has bases at the [[Don Valley Stadium]] and the [[English Institute of Sport]].\n\nThe [[Sheffield Buccaneers Fencing Club]] is based in [[Broomhill, Sheffield, South Yorkshire|Broomhill]].\n\n[[Sheffield City Swimming Club]] is based at [[Ponds Forge]] in Sheffield.\n\nThe [[Sheffield Steel Roller Girls]] [[roller derby]] league is based in the city, playing public bouts at Ponds Forge.\n\nSheffield has several [[field hockey]] clubs, the largest of which are the [[Sheffield Civica Hockey Club]] and [[Sheffield University Bankers Hockey Club]] \u2013 based at [[Goodwin Sports Centre|Goodwin]] \u2013 both of which play to a [[English Hockey League (field hockey)|national level]] within [[Field hockey in England|English hockey]] and regionally.\n\nRacing cyclist [[Malcolm Elliot]] whose successes include the 1988 Tour of Britain and the points jersey in the 1989 [[Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a]] is from Sheffield.\n\nThe [[Manor Grand Prix]] team that will compete in [[Formula One]] from {{F1|2010}} will be run from nearby [[Dinnington, South Yorkshire|Dinnington]].\n\nSheffield also has a strong snowsports community and many competitors in the ski world are from Sheffield (particularly in \"The Brits\")\n\nThe [[Northern Academy of Performing Arts (NAPA)]] are a [[color guard (flag spinning)| Colour Guard]] who compete in the UK circuit for [[Winter guard| Winter Guard ]] (WGUK), and hail from [[Ecclesfield]], Sheffield. The Northern Academy Open Class have been frequent champions of the national circuit.\n\n==Sports Facilities==\nThe city has a huge number of athletics facilities largely as a legacy of the \u00a3147 million pound investment for the [[World Student Games]] held in 1991. These include [[Don Valley Stadium]], [[Ponds Forge]] and [[Sheffield Arena]]. Further venues have been added with the investment as part of the [[English Institute of Sport]]. A [[snooker]] venue and training centre is also due to be built.\n\nAs well as the annual [[World Snooker Championships]], hosted by Sheffield's [[Crucible Theatre]] since 1977, this venue also has a [[Squash (sport)|Squash]] court installed each year for the English Open competition.\n\n[[Sheffield Ski Village]] is Europe's largest artificial ski resort.

Most of which play in the [[South Yorkshire Cricket League]].\n\n==Ice hockey==\n[[Sheffield Steelers]] are an [[ice hockey]] team who play their home matches at [[Sheffield Arena]]. They were formed in 1991 and rapidly rose up the leagues to the [[British Elite Ice Hockey League|British Premier League]] (now called the Elite League). They then won the championship in their second season and again in their third. In total they have won the top flight title 4 times.\n\nThe city also has a several other ice hockey teams (in fact, Sheffield has more senior-level ice hockey teams than any other UK city). The [[Sheffield Steeldogs]] play in the second-tier English Premier League and the [[Sheffield Senators]] and [[Sheffield Spartans]] play in the third-tier National Ice Hockey League North. The [[Sheffield Shadows]] compete in the Women's Premier League and the [[Sheffield Ice Tigers]] play recreational level hockey. All of these teams play out of Ice Sheffield.\n\n==Basketball==\n[[Sheffield Sharks]] are a professional [[basketball]] team who play at [[English Institute of Sport (Sheffield)|English Institute of Sport]]. They were formed in 1994 and won the [[British Basketball League]] in their first season. They have won it a total of 3 times.  The [[City of Sheffield Arrows]] play in the [[English Basketball League]], as do the [[Sheffield Sabres Basketball|Sheffield Sabres]] and the Sheffield Saints.  The Arrows and the Sabres play home games at the [[English Institute of Sport (Sheffield)|English Institute of Sport]] whereas the Saints play at All Saints School. [[Sheffield Hatters]] are a women's basketball team who also play at All Saints. They have dominated the National League winning it every year from 1991 to 2002. However, other teams have caught up in recent years.  Both Sheffield University and Sheffield Hallam University have basketball teams and SHU has produced many good BUCS (British Universities and College Sports) basketball teams over the years reaching the national finals several times. Many SHU players have gone on to play on in other high-level basketball leagues around the country.\n\n==Boxing==\nSheffield has enjoyed huge success in [[boxing]] mainly due to the [[Wincobank]] gym run by [[Brendan Ingle]]. During the 1990s several world champions were produced including [[Naseem Hamed]], [[Herol Graham]], [[Johnny Nelson]] and [[Paul Jones (boxer)|Paul Jones]]. Sheffield continued to produce world champions in the 2000\u2019s with the likes of [[Clinton Woods]], [[Junior Witter]], and [[Kell Brook]].\n\n==Other sports==\nOther notable clubs are the [[Sheffield Eagles]] [[rugby league]] club based at [[Don Valley Stadium]] who won the Rugby League [[Challenge Cup]] in 1998. \n[[Sheffield Tigers]] is a local [[motorcycle speedway|speedway]] team based at [[Owlerton Stadium]]. Speedway arrived at [[Owlerton]] in Sheffield in 1929 and a team took part in league speedway for a number of the pre-war seasons. The track re-opened in 1945 for a couple of meetings and the re-formed Tigers raced in the Northern League of 1946 and the National League Division Two 1947 \u2013 1950. (In part of 1950 the team were known as The Tars.) In 1951 the promotion failed after competing in the Division Two Regional competition and a few open meetings were staged in 1952. \nThe Tigers were revivied as members of the Provincial League in 1960 and have featured in league speedway most seasons since that date. The propmotion also staged speedway at Conference League level with the team known as the Owlerton Prowlers. \nNamesake [[Sheffield Tigers RUFC|Sheffield Tigers]], of the speedway team, and [[Sheffield RUFC]] are local [[Rugby Union]] sides based at [[Dore]].  In 2005 the city hosted the finish of Stage 3 of the [[Tour of Britain]] cycle race. In 2004 and 2005 the city also played host to the start and finish of the Roger Albert Clark Rally.\n\n[[Sheffield Volleyball Club]] was founded in 1989 and runs men's and women's performance teams as well as providing opportunities for junior players.\n\nThe {{SBK|2004}} and {{SBK|2007}} [[List of Superbike World champions|Superbike World Champion]], [[James Toseland]], comes from Sheffield, as does the climber [[Joe Simpson (mountaineer)|Joe Simpson]].\n\nThe 2012 Men's Doubles Wimbledon champion [[Jonathan Marray]] lives in Sheffield, playing at the Hallamshire Tennis Club.\n\nThe [[City of Sheffield Athletic Club]] has bases at the [[Don Valley Stadium]] and the [[English Institute of Sport]].\n\nThe [[Sheffield Buccaneers Fencing Club]] is based in [[Broomhill, Sheffield, South Yorkshire|Broomhill]].\n\n[[Sheffield City Swimming Club]] is based at [[Ponds Forge]] in Sheffield.\n\nThe [[Sheffield Steel Roller Girls]] [[roller derby]] league is based in the city, playing public bouts at Ponds Forge.\n\nSheffield has several [[field hockey]] clubs, the largest of which are the [[Sheffield Civica Hockey Club]] and [[Sheffield University Bankers Hockey Club]] \u2013 based at [[Goodwin Sports Centre|Goodwin]] \u2013 both of which play to a [[English Hockey League (field hockey)|national level]] within [[Field hockey in England|English hockey]] and regionally.\n\nRacing cyclist [[Malcolm Elliot]] whose successes include the 1988 Tour of Britain and the points jersey in the 1989 [[Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a]] is from Sheffield.\n\nThe [[Manor Grand Prix]] team that will compete in [[Formula One]] from {{F1|2010}} will be run from nearby [[Dinnington, South Yorkshire|Dinnington]].\n\nSheffield also has a strong snowsports community and many competitors in the ski world are from Sheffield (particularly in \"The Brits\")\n\nThe [[Northern Academy of Performing Arts (NAPA)]] are a [[color guard (flag spinning)| Colour Guard]] who compete in the UK circuit for [[Winter guard| Winter Guard ]] (WGUK), and hail from [[Ecclesfield]], Sheffield. The Northern Academy Open Class have been frequent champions of the national circuit.\n\n==Sports Facilities==\nThe city has a huge number of athletics facilities largely as a legacy of the \u00a3147 million pound investment for the [[World Student Games]] held in 1991. These include [[Don Valley Stadium]], [[Ponds Forge]] and [[Sheffield Arena]]. Further venues have been added with the investment as part of the [[English Institute of Sport]]. A [[snooker]] venue and training centre is also due to be built.\n\nAs well as the annual [[World Snooker Championships]], hosted by Sheffield's [[Crucible Theatre]] since 1977, this venue also has a [[Squash (sport)|Squash]] court installed each year for the English Open competition.\n\n[[Sheffield Ski Village]] is Europe's largest artificial ski resort. It has a total of 5 slopes and several short training slopes, [[Sheffield Sharks Ski Club]] meets at the Ski Village. There are currently (2007) plans to add the country's largest indoor snow resort next to it. The city also has two indoor climbing centres, one of which is [[The School Room]]. [[Owlerton Stadium]] hosts regular [[greyhound]] racing as well as Sheffield Tigers home ties. It has also previously been home to Sheffield F.C., now based at the Coach and Horses Ground in [[Dronfield]].\n\nThere are a number of [[golf]] courses in Sheffield, varying from \"pitch and putt\" up to at least 15 full size courses. [[Lee Westwood]] from nearby [[Worksop]] mainly uses Sheffield courses for practice. Arguably the most impressive is [[Hallamshire Golf Club]] based at [[Sandygate]], which overlooks the city of Sheffield to the east and the [[Peak District]] to the west.\n\n===English Institute of Sport===\nIn 1998 it was announced that Sheffield would host national headquarters of the [[UK Sports Institute]] with an anticipated investment of \u00a340-\u00a360 million. However, in October 1999 it was decided that a national headquarters should be scrapped in favour of a decentralised structure.<ref name=\"EISHQ\">[http://www.parliament.the-stationery-office.co.uk/pa/cm199798/cmhansrd/vo980611/text/80611w11.htm 1998 written questions] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030926034041/http://www.parliament.the-stationery-office.co.uk/pa/cm199798/cmhansrd/vo980611/text/80611w11.htm |date=26 September 2003 }} and [http://www.parliament.the-stationery-office.co.uk/pa/cm199899/cmhansrd/vo991025/text/91025w31.htm 1999 written questions] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927193125/http://www.parliament.the-stationery-office.co.uk/pa/cm199899/cmhansrd/vo991025/text/91025w31.htm |date=27 September 2007 }} \n</ref> Despite this, the largest sport-related investment in Sheffield so far, was the \u00a323,540,000 [[English Institute of Sport - Sheffield]] (EISS), opened in December 2003.<ref name=\"EIS\">[http://www.uksport.gov.uk/template.asp?id=433 EISS News story] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050510064445/http://www.uksport.gov.uk/template.asp?id=433 |date=10 May 2005 }}</ref> The \u00a315.7 million [[iceSheffield]], opened in May 2003, is also part of the project.<ref name=\"IceSheffield\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.icesheffield.com/icecentre/viewpage.asp?pg_id=3 |title=iceSheffield site |access-date=29 September 2005 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041214100523/http://www.icesheffield.com/icecentre/viewpage.asp?pg_id=3 |archive-date=14 December 2004 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Placed between the existing Sheffield Arena and Don Valley Stadium, this created one of the most concentrated areas of sports facilities in the country.\n\n==Major Sporting Events==\n{|cellpadding=2\n!Event!!Venue!!Date\n|-\n||[[England national football team|England]] Vs [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] ||[[Bramall Lane]]||10 March 1883||The first football international outside London and Glasgow.\n|-\n||[[The Ashes|Ashes]] Test [[English cricket team|England]] Vs [[Australian cricket team|Australia]]||[[Bramall Lane]]||1902\n|-\n||[[FA Cup Final]] Replay||[[Bramall Lane]]||1912\n|-\n||[[British Home Championship]] Vs Scotland||[[Hillsborough Stadium]]||10 April 1920\n|-\n||[[UEFA European Football Championship|European Football Championship]] Qualifier Vs [[France national football team|France]]||[[Hillsborough Stadium]]||3 October 1962||The last qualifying match not held at [[Wembley Stadium]] until its demolition in 2000.\n|-\n||[[1966 Football World Cup]]||[[Hillsborough, South Yorkshire|Hillsborough]]||1966||[[Group games plus one quarter final between West Germany and Uruguay]]\n|-\n||[[World Snooker Championships]]||[[Crucible Theatre]]||1977 to present day\n|-\n||[[FA Cup]] Semi-final [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] Vs [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]]||[[Hillsborough Stadium]]||15 April 1989||Scene of the [[Hillsborough disaster]]\n|-\n||[[World Student Games]]||[[Don Valley Stadium]], [[Ponds Forge]], [[Sheffield Arena]]||1991\n|-\n||[[LEN European Aquatics Championships|European Aquatics Championships]]||[[Ponds Forge]]||1993\n|-\n||[[UEFA European Football Championship|European Football Championship]]||[[Hillsborough Stadium]]||1996||Hosted all [[Denmark national football team|Denmark's]] group matches\n|-\n||[[World Squash Masters]]||[[Hallamshire Tennis and Squash Club]]||1999\n|-\n||[[World Firefighters Games]]||Various||2004\n|-\n||[[Tour of Britain]]||||2004\u201306||Professional Cycle Race\n|-\n||World [[Underwater Hockey]] Championships||[[Ponds Forge]]||August 2006\n|-\n||[[IAAF Athletics Grand Prix]]||[[Don Valley Stadium]]||August 2007\n|}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.playgolfsheffield.com/ Play Golf Sheffield]\n* [http://www.locallife.co.uk/sheffield/sport.asp Local Life] \u2013 gives information on local facilities\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20060205092623/http://www.itchysheffield.co.uk/sport/ Itchy Sheffield] \u2013 local sport guide\n\n{{Football in Sheffield}}\n{{Sheffield}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Sport In Sheffield}}\n[[Category:Sport in Sheffield| ]]\n", "name_user": "Alistair1978", "label": "safe", "comment": "typo (viaWP:JWB)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_in_Sheffield"}

These are intended to crowd in other sources of finance, whether from domestic governments, other donors or the private sector.\n\nThe [[Green Climate Fund]] is currently the largest multilateral climate fund, and climate change and development practitioners alike are focused on seeing these resources flow.\n\nClimate financing by the world\u2019s six largest multilateral development banks (MDBs) rose to a seven-year high of $35.2 billion in 2017. According to IRENA, the global energy transition could contribute $19 trillion in economic gains by 2050.\n\n==Private climate finance==\nPublic finance has traditionally been a significant source of infrastructure investment.

The 2010 the World Development Report preliminary estimates of financing needs for mitigation and adaptation activities in developing countries range from USD 140-175 billion per year for mitigation over the next 20 years with associated financing needs of USD 265-565 billion and USD30 \u2013 100 billion a year over the period 2010 - 2050 for adaptation.<ref>World Bank Group(2010), \"[http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTWDR2010/Resources/5287678-1226014527953/Chapter-6.pdf World Development Report 2010: Development and Climate Change, World Bank Groupe, Washington DC, ch. 6, p. 257]</ref>\nThe International Energy Agency\u2019s 2011 World Energy Outlook (WEO) estimates that in order to meet growing demand for energy through 2035, USD 16.9 trillion in new investment for new power generation is projected, with renewable energy (RE) comprising 60% of the total.<ref>International Energy Agency (2011).

The largest multilateral climate funds are the [[Climate Investment Funds]] (CIFs), [[Green Climate Fund]] (GCF),  [[The Adaptation Fund|Adaptation Fund]] (AF), and [[Global Environment Facility]] (GEF)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://unfccc.int/topics/climate-finance/the-big-picture/climate-finance-in-the-negotiations|title=Climate Finance {{!}} UNFCCC|website=unfccc.int|language=en|access-date=2018-12-03}}</ref>. In 2016, these four funds approved $2.78 billion of project support. India received the largest total amount of single-country support, followed by the Ukraine and Chile. Tuvalu received the most funding per person, followed by Samoa and Dominica.

These are intended to crowd in other sources of finance, whether from domestic governments, other donors or the private sector.\n\nThe [[Green Climate Fund]] is currently the largest multilateral climate fund, and climate change and development practitioners alike are focused on seeing these resources flow.\n\nClimate financing by the world\u2019s six largest multilateral development banks (MDBs) rose to a seven-year high of $35.2 billion in 2017. According to IRENA, the global energy transition could contribute $19 trillion in economic gains by 2050.\n\n==Private climate finance==\nPublic finance has traditionally been a significant source of infrastructure investment. However, public budgets are often insufficient for larger and more complex infrastructure projects, particularly in lower-income countries. Climate-compatible investments often have higher investment needs than conventional (fossil fuel) measures,<ref>{{Cite journal|vauthors=Gouldson A, Colenbrander S, Sudmant A, McAnulla F, Kerr N, Sakai P, Hall S, Papargyropoulou E, Kuylenstierna J|date=2015|title=Exploring the economic case for climate action in cities|journal=Global Environmental Change|volume=35|pages=93\u2013105|doi=10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2015.07.009}}</ref> and may also carry higher financial risks because the technologies are not proven or the projects have high upfront costs.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Schmidt TS|date=2014|title=Low-carbon investment risks and de-risking|journal=Nature Climate Change|volume=4|issue=4|pages=237\u2013239|doi=10.1038/nclimate2112}}</ref> If countries are going to access the scale of funding required, it is critical to consider the full spectrum of funding sources and their requirements, as well as the different mechanisms available from them, and how they can be combined.<ref>[https://cdkn.org/resource/understanding-bankability-unlocking-climate-finance-development/?loclang=en_ Understanding \u2018bankability\u2019 and unlocking climate finance for climate compatible development], Climate & Development Knowledge Network, 31 July 2017</ref> There is therefore growing recognition that private finance will be needed to cover the financing shortfall.\n\nPrivate investors could be drawn to sustainable urban infrastructure projects where a sufficient return on investment is forecast based on project income flows or low-risk government debt repayments.
