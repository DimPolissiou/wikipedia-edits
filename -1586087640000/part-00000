{"title_page": "Thomas Mortimer", "text_new": "{{for|the English writer|Thomas Mortimer (writer)}}\n{{EngvarB|date=January 2018}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=January 2018}}\n'''Sir Thomas Mortimer''' (c. 1350\u20131399) was a medieval English soldier and statesman who served briefly in several important administrative and judicial state offices in [[Ireland]] and played a part in the opposition to the government of King [[Richard II of England|Richard II]]. He was an [[Legitimacy (family law)|illegitimate]] member of the [[Mortimer#Medieval magnates|Mortimer family]], who  were one of the leading noble houses in England and Ireland, and he helped to manage the Mortimer  lands during the minority of the family heir, his nephew [[Roger Mortimer, 4th Earl of March|Roger, earl of March]]. Sir Thomas was also a close associate of the [[Lords Appellant]] who opposed the administration  of King Richard II.\n\nSir Thomas took part in the appellants' rebellion in 1387 against the king, and fought at the [[Battle of Radcot Bridge]], during which he killed Sir Thomas Molineux, one of the royal commanders. 10 years later, when the king took his revenge against the rebels, this act ultimately led to his conviction for [[treason]]. He fled for his life and died in [[exile]].\n\n==Background==\n[[Image:Conte de la Marsche.jpg|thumb|150px|Thomas's father, Roger, 2nd Earl of March]]\n\nThomas was an illegitimate son of [[Roger Mortimer, 2nd Earl of March]] (1328\u20131360).{{sfn|Dunn|2003|p=56}} He was described as an esquire in 1367, pointing to a birth date of  around 1350.{{sfn|Isaacson|1913|p=54}} He seems to have been treated by his father and  his brother very much as one of the family. Nothing is known of his mother. By 1380 he had acquired considerable military expertise, and had been [[Knight Bachelor|knighted]]. When his legitimate brother [[Edmund Mortimer, 3rd Earl of March]] was made [[Lord Lieutenant of Ireland]] in 1379, Thomas went with him to Ireland and acted as his Deputy, holding in his name a Great Council at [[Clonmel]].{{sfn|Otway-Ruthven|1968|p=315}} Edmund was charged with the task of subduing the Gaelic clans in [[Ulster]] and [[Munster]], but he had only limited success in this task.\n\n==Lord Deputy of Ireland==\nEdmund's sudden death in December 1381 left the [[Dublin]] Government in a quandary, since there were very few men willing  or qualified to assume the office of Lord Lieutenant, at a time of exceptional political turbulence in Ireland. Richard Wyre, [[Bishop of Cloyne]], proposed that Thomas Mortimer should be appointed Lord Lieutenant, both for his military experience and his ability to retain the loyalty of his brother's [[retinue]].{{sfn|Otway-Ruthven|1968|pp=315\u20136}} In the event King [[Richard II]] appointed Thomas's nephew, [[Roger Mortimer, 4th Earl of March]], a child of seven, as Lord Lieutenant.  The absurdity of this choice was lessened to some extent by the appointment of Thomas as Lord Deputy and [[Lord Chief Justice of the King's Bench for Ireland|Lord Chief Justice]].{{sfn|Otway-Ruthven|1968|p=316}}\n\n==Return to England==\nOn the appointment of Sir [[Philip Courtenay (died 1406)|Philip Courtenay]] as Lord Lieutenant of Ireland in February 1383, Thomas returned to England. His nephew's [[wardship]] had been entrusted to a group of magnates which included [[Richard FitzAlan, 4th Earl of Arundel]], of whom Thomas was an intimate friend. It was probably Arundel who appointed Thomas to the position of steward of the Mortimer estates during Roger's minority, thus greatly enhancing his political standing.{{sfn|Dunn|2002|p=162}} As Roger grew older he and his uncle became close, going hunting together and exchanging gifts of wine: Dunn suggests that Thomas was the closest Roger ever knew to a father.{{sfn|Dunn|2002|p=164}}\n\n==The Appellants==\nArundel was a  key member of the group of nobles called the [[Lords Appellant]], who had emerged as opponents of Richard II and the royal favourite [[Robert de Vere, Duke of Ireland]]. Mortimer was closely associated with them and is known to have visited Arundel's house regularly during 1387, the critical year in the Appellants' rise to power.\n\n===The Battle of Radcot Bridge===\n{{main|Battle of Radcot Bridge}}\n\nIn December 1387, at [[Radcot Bridge]], the Appellants clashed with the royal army, headed by Robert de Vere and Sir Thomas Molineux, Constable of [[Chester Castle]]; de Vere was defeated and forced to flee the country.  Mortimer himself killed Molineux,  who was one of the few casualties of the fight.{{sfn|Dunn|2002|p=162}} According to [[Thomas Walsingham]], Molineux, who had attempted to flee, pleaded for his life, but Mortimer pulled off Molinuex's [[helmet]] and stabbed him in the head with a [[dagger]].{{sfn|Gillespie|1975|p=163}}\n\n[[Image:Robert de Vere fleeing Radcot Bridge.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Robert de Vere fleeing after his defeat at the Battle of Radcot Bridge]]\n\nDuring the brief rule of the Appellants, Mortimer was in high favour. He was appointed Justiciar of Ireland, but Richard, despite his temporary loss of power, somehow managed to countermand the appointment (no doubt he feared to surrender control of Ireland entirely to his enemies) and it never took effect. Despite the King's mistrust of them,  Thomas and his nephew Roger, with troops, accompanied him on his Irish expedition in 1394;{{sfn|Otway-Ruthven|1968|p=326}} and when Roger was reappointed Lord Lieutenant in 1396, Thomas went to Ireland with him.\n\n==Downfall==\nIn 1397 the King  moved to destroy the surviving Lords Appellant.  Arundel, Mortimer's patron, was convicted of treason and executed. Mortimer was \"appealed for\" (i.e. charged with) treason, in that his killing of Molineux, the King's commander ten years earlier was deemed in law to be an attempt to murder the King himself. Mortimer was not permitted to stand trial, but ordered to surrender himself within three months. Unsurprisingly Mortimer instead chose to flee the country: the King accused Roger, probably with good reason, of conniving at his uncle's escape.{{sfn|Otway-Ruthven|1968|p=337}} Thomas was declared a traitor and his lands were forfeited to the Crown. He took refuge in [[Scotland]] where he died in 1399.{{sfn|Given-Wilson|2016|p=45 n. 41}}\n\n==Marriage==\nHe married Agnes de Poynings, daughter of [[Michael de Poynings, 2nd Baron Poynings]], and widow of [[William Bardolf, 4th Baron Bardolf]]. They had no children. She was described as a widow on 9 January 1403, indicating that Sir Thomas Mortimer was dead by then.{{sfn|Nicolas|1826|p=162}}\n\n==Character==\nAlthough the details (if they were accurately reported) of his killing of Molineux show him in a rather sinister light, Mortimer had the respect and esteem of many who knew him, including his brother and his nephew.

He came from a musical family: his father, [[Cliff Townshend]], was a professional alto saxophonist in the [[Royal Air Force]]'s dance band [[the Squadronaires]] and his mother, Betty (n\u00e9e Dennis), was a singer with the Sydney Torch and Les Douglass Orchestras.{{sfn|Giuliano|2002|p=2}} The Townshends had a volatile marriage, as both drank heavily and possessed fiery tempers. Cliff Townshend was often away from his family touring with his band while Betty carried on affairs with other men. The two split when Townshend was a toddler and he was sent to live with his maternal grandmother Emma Dennis, whom Pete later described as \"clinically insane\". The two-year separation ended when Cliff and Betty purchased a house together on Woodgrange Avenue in middle-class [[Acton, London|Acton]], and the young Pete was happily reunited with his parents.{{sfn|Wilkerson|2006|p=6}} His neighbourhood was one-third Polish, and a devout Jewish family upstairs shared their housing with them and cooking with them\u2014many of his father's closest friends were Jewish.<ref name=\"The Secret Jewish History of The Who\">{{Cite web |url=https://forward.com/culture/music/434550/whos-jewish/ |title=The Secret Jewish History of The Who |last=Rogovoy |first=Seth |date=2019-11-12 |website=The Forward |access-date=2019-11-12}}</ref>\n\nTownshend says he did not have many friends growing up, so he spent much of his boyhood reading adventure novels like ''[[Gulliver's Travels]]'' and ''[[Treasure Island]]''.{{sfn|Giuliano|2002|p=8}} He enjoyed his family's frequent excursions to the seaside and the [[Isle of Man]]. It was on one of these trips in the summer of 1956 that he repeatedly watched the 1956 film [[Rock Around the Clock (film)|''Rock Around the Clock'']], sparking his fascination with American [[rock and roll]].{{sfn|Giuliano|2002|p=12}} Not long thereafter, he went to see [[Bill Haley (musician)|Bill Haley]] perform in London, Townshend's first concert.{{sfn|Wilkerson|2006|p=8}} At the time, he did not see himself pursuing a career as a professional musician; instead, he wanted to become a journalist.{{sfn|Giuliano|2002|p=7}}\n\nUpon passing the [[eleven-plus]] exam, Townshend was enrolled at [[Acton County Grammar School]].{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=19}} At Acton County, he was frequently bullied because he had a large nose, an experience that profoundly affected him.{{sfn|Wilkerson|2006|p=9}} His grandmother Emma purchased his first guitar for Christmas in 1956, an inexpensive Spanish model.{{sfn|Wilkerson|2006|p=10}} Though his father taught him a couple of chords, Townshend was largely self-taught on the instrument and never learned to read music.{{sfn|Giuliano|2002|p=13}} Townshend and school friend [[John Entwistle]] formed a short-lived [[trad jazz]] group, the Confederates, featuring Townshend on banjo and Entwistle on horns.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=26}} The Confederates played gigs at the Congo Club, a youth club run by the Acton Congregational Church, and covered [[Acker Bilk]], [[Kenny Ball]], and [[Lonnie Donegan]].{{sfn|Giuliano|2002|p=15}} However, both became influenced by the increasing popularity of [[rock 'n' roll]], with Townshend particularly admiring [[Cliff Richard]]'s debut single, \"[[Move It]]\".{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2009|p=17}} Townshend left the Confederates after getting into a fight with the group's drummer, Chris Sherwin, and purchased a \"reasonably good Czechoslovakian guitar\" at his mother's antique shop.{{sfn|Wilkerson|2006|p=12}}\n\nTownshend's brothers Paul and [[Simon Townshend|Simon]] were born in 1957 and 1960, respectively.{{sfn|Wilkerson|2006|p=7}} Lacking the requisite test scores to attend university, Pete was faced with the decision of art school, music school, or getting a job.{{sfn|Giuliano|2002|p=19}} He ultimately chose to study [[graphic design]] at [[Ealing Art College]], enrolling in 1961. At Ealing, Townshend studied alongside future [[The Rolling Stones|Rolling Stones]] guitarist [[Ronnie Wood]]. Notable artists and designers gave lectures at the college such as [[auto-destructive art]] pioneer [[Gustav Metzger]].{{sfn|Wilkerson|2006|p=14}} Townshend dropped out in 1964 to focus on music full-time.{{sfn|Wooldridge|2002|p=136}}\n\n==Musical career==\n===1961\u20131964: the Detours===\nIn late 1961, Entwistle joined the Detours, a [[skiffle]]/[[rock and roll]] band, led by Roger Daltrey. The new bass player then suggested Townshend join as an additional guitarist.{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2009|p=18}} In the early days of the Detours, the band's repertoire consisted of instrumentals by [[the Shadows]] and [[the Ventures]], as well as pop and trad jazz covers. Their lineup coalesced around [[Roger Daltrey]] on lead guitar, Townshend on rhythm guitar, Entwistle on bass, [[Doug Sandom]] on drums and Colin Dawson as vocalist.{{sfn|Giuliano|2002|p=22}} Daltrey was considered the leader of the group and, according to Townshend, \"ran things the way he wanted them.\"{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2009|p=22}} Dawson quit in 1962 after arguing too much with Daltrey, who subsequently moved to lead vocalist. As a result, Townshend, with Entwistle's encouragement, became the sole guitarist. Through Townshend's mother, the group obtained a management contract with local promoter Robert Druce,{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2009|p=21}} who started booking the band as a support act for bands including [[Screaming Lord Sutch]], [[Cliff Bennett and the Rebel Rousers]], [[Shane Fenton and the Fentones]], and [[Johnny Kidd (singer)|Johnny Kidd]] and the Pirates.{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2009|p=24}} In 1963, Townshend's father arranged an amateur recording of \"It Was You\", the first song his son ever wrote.{{sfn|Giuliano|2002|p=40}} The Detours became aware of a group of the same name in February 1964, forcing them to change their name.{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2009|p=26}} Townshend's roommate [[Richard Barnes (author)|Richard Barnes]] came up with \"The Who\", and Daltrey decided it was the best choice.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=66}}\n\n===1964\u20131982: The Who===\n{{main|The Who}}\n[[File:Pete Townshend and Keith Moon 1967.jpg|thumb|190px|right|Townshend (with Moon, rear right) backstage before a gig at [[Friedrich-Ebert-Halle]] in [[Ludwigshafen|Ludwigshafen, Germany]] on 12 April 1967]]\n\nNot long after the name change, drummer [[Doug Sandom]] was replaced by [[Keith Moon]], who had been drumming semi-professionally with the Beachcombers for several years.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=80}} The band was soon taken on by a [[Mod (subculture)|mod]] publicist named [[Peter Meaden]] who convinced them to change their name to the High Numbers to give the band more of a mod feel. After bringing out one failed single (\"I'm the Face/Zoot Suit\"), they dropped Meaden and were signed on by two new managers, [[Chris Stamp]] and [[Kit Lambert]], who had paired up with the intention of finding new talent and creating a documentary about them.{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2009|p=55}} The band anguished over a name that all felt represented the band best, and dropped the High Numbers name, reverting to the Who.{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2009|p=60}} In June 1964, during a performance at the Railway Tavern, Townshend accidentally broke the top of his guitar on the low ceiling and proceeded to destroy the entire instrument.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=125}} The on-stage destruction of instruments soon became a regular part of the Who's live shows.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=126}}\n\nWith the assistance of Lambert, the Who caught the ear of American record producer [[Shel Talmy]], who had the band signed to a record contract. Townshend wrote a song, \"[[I Can't Explain]]\", as a deliberate sound-alike of [[the Kinks]], another group Talmy produced. Released as a single in January 1965, \"I Can't Explain\" was the Who's first hit, reaching number eight on the British charts.{{sfn|Wilkerson|2006|p=40}} A follow-up single (\"[[Anyway, Anyhow, Anywhere]]\"), credited to both Townshend and Daltrey, also reached the top 10 in the UK.{{sfn|Howard|2004|pp=107\u2013108}} However, it was the release of the Who's third single, \"[[My Generation]]\", in November that, according to Who biographer Mark Wilkerson, \"cemented their reputation as a hard-nosed band who reflected the feelings of thousands of pissed-off adolescents at the time.\"{{sfn|Wilkerson|2006|p=52}} The Townshend-penned single reached number two on the UK charts, becoming the Who's biggest hit. The song and its famous line \"I hope I die before I get old\" was \"very much about trying to find a place in society\", Townshend stated in an interview with [[David Fricke]].{{sfn|Wilkerson|2006|p=53}}\n\nTo capitalise on their recent single success, the Who's debut album ''[[My Generation (album)|My Generation]]'' (''The Who Sings My Generation'' in the US) was released in late 1965, containing original material written by Townshend and several [[James Brown]] covers that Daltrey favoured.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/the-who-sings-my-generation-mw0000020578|title=My Generation&nbsp;\u2013 review|first=Richie|last=Unterberger|website=[[AllMusic]]|accessdate=19 September 2013}}</ref> Townshend continued to write several successful singles for the band, including \"[[Pictures of Lily]]\", \"[[Substitute (The Who song)|Substitute]]\", \"[[I'm a Boy]]\", and \"[[Happy Jack (song)|Happy Jack]]\".{{sfn|Giuliano|2002|p=63}} Lambert encouraged Townshend to write longer pieces of music for the next album, which became the \"[[A Quick One, While He's Away]]\". The album was subsequently titled ''[[A Quick One]]''{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=227}} and reached No. 4 in the charts upon its release in December 1966.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=229}} In their stage shows, Townshend developed a [[guitar stunt]] in which he would [[Guitar stunt#Townshend|swing his right arm against the guitar strings]] in a style reminiscent of the vanes of a windmill.{{sfn|Giuliano|2002|p=37}} He developed this style after watching [[The Rolling Stones|Rolling Stones]] guitarist [[Keith Richards]] warm up before a show.<ref name=Daly>{{cite news |url=http://www.tampabay.com/features/books/review-pete-townshend-memoir-who-i-am-gloomy-yet-addictive/1259585 |title=Review: Pete Townshend memoir 'Who I Am' gloomy yet addictive |work=[[Tampa Bay Times]] |first=Sean |last=Daly |date=4 November 2012 |accessdate=5 March 2014}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Pete Townshend Windmill-(jha).jpg|thumb|right|200px|Townshend's \"windmill\" technique]]\nThe Who commenced their first US tour on 22 March 1967.{{sfn|Wilkerson|2006|p=76}} It did not start well, as Townshend and Daltrey were briefly jailed for assaulting a police officer they mistook for a heckler. Townshend took to trashing his hotel suites, though not to the extent of his bandmate Moon.{{sfn|Giuliano|2002|p=76}} He also began experimenting with [[LSD]], though stopped taking the drug after receiving a potent hit after the [[Monterey Pop Festival]] on 18 June.{{sfn|Giuliano|2002|p=77}} Released in December, their next album was ''[[The Who Sell Out]]''\u2014a [[concept album]] based on pirate radio, which had been instrumental in raising the Who's popularity. It included several humorous jingles and mock commercials between songs,{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2009|p=148}} and the Who's biggest US single, \"[[I Can See for Miles]]\".{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2009|p=149}} Despite the success of \"[[I Can See for Miles]]\", which reached No. 9 on the American charts, Townshend was surprised it was not a smash hit, as he considered it the best song he had written up to that point.{{sfn|Wilkerson|2006|p=93}}\n\nBy 1968, Townshend became interested in the teachings of [[Meher Baba]].{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=294}} He began to develop a musical piece about a deaf, dumb, and blind boy who would experience sensations musically.{{sfn|Wilkerson|2006|p=113}} The piece would explore the tenets of Baba's philosophy.{{sfn|Giuliano|2002|p=89}} The result was the [[rock opera]] ''[[Tommy (The Who album)|Tommy]]'', released on 23 May 1969 to critical and commercial success. [[Leonard Bernstein]] praised the album, saying its \"sheer power, invention and brilliance of performance outstrips anything which has ever come out of a recording studio.\"{{sfn|Giuliano|2002|p=90}} In support of ''Tommy'', the Who launched a tour that included a memorable appearance at the [[Woodstock Festival]] on 17 August.

Among his most well-known accomplishments are the creation of a second pioneering rock opera, ''[[Quadrophenia]]''; his dramatic stage persona; his use of guitar feedback as sonic technique; and the introduction of the synthesiser as a rock instrument. Townshend revisited album-length storytelling throughout his career and remains the musician most associated with the rock opera form.

In response to bootlegging of these, he compiled his personal highlights (and \"Evolution\", a collaboration with [[Ronnie Lane]]), and released his first major-label solo title, 1972's ''[[Who Came First]]''.

This release was followed in 1982 by ''[[All the Best Cowboys Have Chinese Eyes]]'', which included the popular radio track \"[[Slit Skirts]]\". While not a huge commercial success, noted music critic Timothy Duggan listed it as \"Townshend's most honest and introspective work since Quadrophenia.\" Through the rest of the 1980s and early 1990s Townshend would again experiment with the [[rock opera]] and related formats, releasing several story-based albums including ''[[White City: A Novel]]'' (1985), ''[[The Iron Man: A Musical]]'' (1989), and ''[[Psychoderelict]]'' (1993).\nTownshend also got the chance to play with his hero [[Hank B.

According to Townshend, postwar trauma was the driving force behind the rock music revolution in the UK. \"Trauma is passed from generation to generation\", he said, \"I've unwittingly inherited what my father experienced.\"<ref>{{citation |last=Kelts |first=Roland |date=9 October 2012 |title=Pete Townshend\u2019s War |url=http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/pete-townshends-war |work=The New Yorker |accessdate=20 August 2015}}</ref> Townshend notes that growing up in this period produced the narrative that runs through his music of a boy lost in the stresses and pressures of postwar life.<ref>{{citation |last=Victoriano |first=Camila |date=16 October 2012 |title=Townshend Talks Postwar Lyricism |url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/10/16/pete-townshend-who-berklee |work=[[The Harvard Crimson]] |accessdate=20 August 2015}}</ref> In his autobiography, he wrote: {{quote|I wasn't trying to play beautiful music.

Townshend's roommate at Ealing Art College, Tom Wright, had a large record collection, and Townshend listened to and became influenced by R&B and rock & roll artists like [[Howlin' Wolf]], [[John Lee Hooker]], [[Bo Diddley]], [[Booker T. & the MGs]], [[Little Walter]], and [[Chuck Berry]].{{sfn|Wilkerson|2006|p=16}} He was also strongly influenced by cellist [[Malcolm Cecil]], who often damaged his cello during performances, along with [[Gustav Metzger]], pioneer of [[auto-destructive art]]. In light of these influences, guitar smashing became not just an expression of youthful angst, but also a means of conveying ideas through musical performance. \"We advanced a new concept\", he writes. \"Destruction is art when set to music.\"<ref name=art />\n\n==Equipment==\n{{BLP sources section|date=July 2012}}\n{{See also|The Who's musical equipment}}\n\n===Guitars and amplifiers===\n[[File:BouncingTownshend.jpg|thumb|230px|right|Townshend leaping into air in concert]]\nThroughout his solo career and his career with the Who, Townshend has played a large variety of guitars&nbsp;\u2013 mostly various [[Gibson Guitar Corporation|Gibson]], [[Fender Musical Instruments Corporation|Fender]] and [[Rickenbacker]] models. He has also used [[Guild Guitar Company|Guild]], [[Takamine Guitars|Takamine]] and [[Gibson J-200]] [[Acoustic guitar|acoustic]] models, with the J-200 providing his signature recorded acoustic sound in such songs as \"[[Pinball Wizard]]\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.musicradar.com/reviews/gibson-montana-sj-200-standard|title=Gibson Montana SJ 200 Standard review|first=Acoustic Magazine 2018-05-05T13:33:44 124Z Acoustic|last=Guitars|website=MusicRadar.com}}</ref>\n\nIn the early days with the Who, Townshend played an Emile Grimshaw SS De Luxe and 6-string and 12-string Rickenbacker semi-hollow electric guitars primarily (particularly the Rose-Morris UK-imported models with special f-holes). When the excited audience responded enthusiastically after he accidentally broke the head off his guitar on a low ceiling during a concert at the Railway Hotel pub in [[Wealdstone]], west London, he incorporated the eventual smashing of his instrument into the band's performances.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/articles/p/pete-townshends-guitar/|title=Pete Townshend's Guitar|first=Online Museum|last=Victoria and Albert Museum|date=3 May 2011|website=Vam.ac.uk|accessdate=12 May 2019}}</ref> However, as [[Smashing guitars|instrument-smashing]] became increasingly integrated into the Who's concert sets, he switched to more durable and resilient (and, importantly, cheaper) guitars for smashing, such as the [[Fender Stratocaster]], [[Fender Telecaster]] and various [[Danelectro]] models.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.thewho.net/whotabs/gear/guitar/danelectro.html|title=Danelectro Guitars &#124; Pete Townshend\u2019s Guitar Gear &#124; Whotabs|website=Thewho.net}}</ref> On the Who's ''[[Smothers Brothers#The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour|The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour]]'' appearance in 1967, Townshend used a [[Vox (musical equipment)|Vox]] Cheetah guitar,<ref name=\"auto\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.guitarplayer.com/technique/10-things-you-gotta-do-to-play-like-pete-townshend-tab|title=10 Things You Gotta Do To Play Like Pete Townshend|first=Jesse|last=Gress|website=GuitarPlayer.com}}</ref> which he only used for that performance; and the guitar was destroyed by Townshend and Moon's drum explosion. In the late 1960s, Townshend began playing [[Gibson SG]] Special models almost exclusively. He used this guitar at the [[Woodstock]] and [[Isle of Wight]] shows in 1969 and 1970, as well as the ''[[Live at Leeds]]'' performance in 1970.\n\nBy 1970 [[Gibson Guitar Corporation|Gibson]] changed the design of the SG Special which Townshend had been using previously, and he began using other guitars. For much of the 1970s, he used a [[Gibson Les Paul#Deluxe|Gibson Les Paul Deluxe]], some with only two mini-[[humbucker]] pick-ups and others modified with a third pick-up in the \"middle position\" (a [[DiMarzio]] Superdistortion / Dual Sound). He can be seen using several of these guitars in the documentary ''The Kids Are Alright'', although in the studio he often played a '59 [[Gretsch 6120]] guitar (given to him by [[Joe Walsh]]),<ref name=\"auto\"/> most notably on the albums ''[[Who's Next]]'' and ''[[Quadrophenia]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.guitarworld.com/gear/the-secrets-behind-pete-townshends-tone-on-the-whos-wont-get-fooled-again|title=The secrets behind Pete Townshend's tone on The Who's Won't Get Fooled Again|first=Chris|last=Gill 2019-07-08T18:36:48Z|website=Guitarworld.com|accessdate=4 February 2020}}</ref>\n\nDuring the 1980s, Townshend mainly used Fenders, Rickenbackers and Telecaster-style models built for him by [[Schecter Guitar Research|Schecter]] and various other [[luthier]]s. Since the late-1980s, Townshend has used the [[Eric Clapton Stratocaster|Fender Eric Clapton Signature Stratocaster]], with [[Lace Sensor]] pick-ups,<ref name=\"auto\"/> both in the studio and on tour. Some of his Stratocaster guitars feature a Fishman PowerBridge piezo pick-up system to simulate acoustic guitar tones. This piezo system is controlled by an extra volume control behind the guitar's bridge.\n\nDuring the Who's 1989 Tour Townshend played a Rickenbacker guitar that was ironically smashed accidentally when he tripped over it. Instead of throwing the smashed parts away, Townshend reassembled the pieces as a sculpture.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.guitarplayer.com/players/pete-townshends-smashed-rickenbacker-takes-more-than-78k-at-auction|title=Pete Townshend\u2019s Smashed Rickenbacker Takes More Than $78K at Auction|first=Christopher|last=Scapelliti|website=GuitarPlayer.com}}</ref> The sculpture was featured at the ''Rock Stars, Cars And Guitars 2'' exhibit during the summer of 2009 at [[The Henry Ford]] museum.\n\n[[File:Pete Townshend 2007.jpg|thumb|right|190px|Townshend playing a Fender [[Eric Clapton Signature Stratocaster]]]]\n\nThere are several [[Gibson Guitar Corporation|Gibson]] Pete Townshend signature guitars, such as the Pete Townshend SG, the Pete Townshend J-200, and three different Pete Townshend Les Paul Deluxes. The SG was clearly marked as a Pete Townshend limited edition model and came with a special case and certificate of authenticity, signed by Townshend himself. There has also been a Pete Townshend signature [[Rickenbacker]] limited edition guitar of the model 1998, which was his main 6-string guitar in the Who's early days. The run featured 250 guitars which were made between July 1987 \u2013 March 1988, and according to Rickenbacker CEO John Hall, the entire run sold out before serious advertising could be done.\n\nHe also used the [[Gibson ES-335]], one of which he donated to the Hard Rock Cafe. Townshend also used a [[Gibson EDS-1275]] double-neck very briefly circa late 1967, and both a [[Harmony Company|Harmony]] Sovereign H1270<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thewho.net/whotabs/equipment/guitar/equip-harmony12.html |title=Pete's Equipment, Harmony Sovereign H-1270 12-string acoustic guitar, Whotabs, Pete Townshend |website=Thewho.net |accessdate=15 May 2011}}</ref> and a [[Fender Electric XII]] for the studio sessions for ''[[Tommy (rock opera)|Tommy]]'' for the 12-string guitar parts. He also occasionally used Fender Jazzmasters on stage in 1967 and 1968<ref>http://www.thewho.net/whotabs/gear/guitar/fenderjazzmaster.html</ref> and in the studio for ''Tommy''.\n\nIn 2006 Townshend had a pedalboard designed by long-time gear guru [[Pete Cornish]]. The board apparently is composed with a compressor, an old Boss OD-1 overdrive pedal, as well as a [[T-Rex Engineering|T-Rex]] Replica delay pedal.\n\n===Amps===\nOver the years, Townshend has used many types of amplifier, including [[Vox (musical equipment)|Vox]], [[Henri Selmer Paris|Selmer]], [[Fender Musical Instruments Corporation|Fender]], [[Marshall Amplification|Marshall]], [[Hiwatt]] etc., sticking to using Hiwatt amps for most of four decades. Around the time of ''[[Who's Next]]'', he used a tweed [[Fender Bandmaster]] amp (also given to him by Joe Walsh in 1970<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thewho.net/whotabs/gear/guitar/fenderbandmaster.html |title=Pete\u2019s Gear: 1959 Fender Bandmaster Amplifier|date= |access-date=4 January 2016}}</ref>), which he also used for ''[[Quadrophenia]]'' and ''[[The Who by Numbers]]''. While recording ''[[Face Dances]]'' and the collaborative album ''[[Rough Mix]]'', Townshend made use of a [[Peavey Electronics#Noteworthy products#Classic series guitar amplifiers|Peavey Vintage 4\u00d710]] amplifier in the studio. Since 1989, his rig consisted of four Fender Vibro-King stacks and a Hiwatt head driving two custom made 2\u00d712\" Hiwatt/Mesa Boogie speaker cabinets. However, since 2006, he has only three Vibro-King stacks, one of which is a backup.\n\nTownshend figured prominently in the development of what is widely known in rock circles as the \"[[Marshall stack]]\". He ordered several speaker cabinets that contained eight 12\" speakers in a housing standing nearly six feet in height with the top half of the cabinet slanted slightly upward. These were too heavy to move easily, so [[Jim Marshall (businessman)|Jim Marshall]] cut the massive speaker cabinet in half, at the suggestion of Townshend, with each cabinet containing four 12-inch speakers. One of the cabinets had half of the speaker baffle slanted upwards and Marshall made these two cabinets stackable. The Marshall stack was born, and Townshend used these as well as Hiwatt stacks.\n\nHe has always regarded his instruments as being merely tools of the trade <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.premierguitar.com/articles/Pete_Townshend_On_Guitar_Smashing_Regrets_Stylistic_Evolution_and_Becoming_a_Gear_Aficionado|title=Pete Townshend: On Guitar-Smashing Regrets, Stylistic Evolution, and Becoming a Gear Aficionado|website=Premierguitar.com|accessdate=12 May 2019}}</ref> and has, in latter years, kept his most prized instruments well away from the concert stage. These instruments include a few vintage and reissue Rickenbackers, the Gretsch 6120, an original 1952 [[Fender Telecaster]], Gibson Custom Shop's artist limited edition reissues of Townshend's Les Paul DeLuxe models 1, 3 and 9 as well his signature SG Special reissue.\n\n===Keyboards===\nTownshend played keyboards on several Who songs. On ''Who's Next'', he began to work with [[analogue synthesizer]]s, using the [[ARP 2600]] model that he first encountered at [[Cambridge University]].{{sfn|Giuliano|2002|p=95}} He had this to say about the instrument: \"I like synthesizers because they bring into my hands things that aren't in my hands: the sound of an orchestra, French horns, strings. There are gadgets on synthesizers that enable one to become a virtuoso on the keyboard. You can play something slowly and you press a switch and it plays it back at double speed. Whereas on the guitar you're stuck with as fast as you can play and I don't play fast, I just play hard. So when it goes to playing something fast I go to the synth.\"{{sfn|Giuliano|2002|p=96}}\n\nThe synths Townshend was referring to include the EMS [[VCS3]], the [[ARP Instruments, Inc.]] [[ARP 2600]], some of which modified a [[Lowrey organ|Lowrey TBO Berkshire organ]]. Current photos of his home studio also show an [[ARP 2500]]. Townshend was featured in ARP promotional materials in the early 1970s.\n\nSince the late 1980s Townshend has predominantly used [[Synclavier]] Digital Audio systems for keyboard composition, particularly solo albums and projects. He currently owns three systems, one large Synclavier 9600 Tapeless Studio system, originally installed in his riverside Oceanic Studio, later transferred to a seagoing barge moored alongside the studio on the River Thames, and currently based in his home studio. He also uses a special adapted smaller Synclavier 3200 system which can be transported, enabling him to carry on working away from his main studio. This 3200 system was modified to be of similar specification to the 9600, including the addition internally of FM voices, stereo Poly voices and with the large VPK keyboard. This is the only Synclavier 3200 system of this specification in existence, custom-designed and built for Townshend by Steve Hills. The third system Townshend owns is one of the first Synclavier II systems ever built. The ORK (original smaller) keyboard of which is on display in his company's head office alongside a pink [[Vespa]] scooter.\n\n==Literary work==\nAlthough known for his musical compositions and musicianship, Townshend has been extensively involved in the literary world for more than three decades, writing newspaper and magazine articles, book reviews, essays, books, and scripts.\n\nAn early example of Townshend's writing came in August 1970 with the first of nine instalments of \"The Pete Townshend Page\", a monthly column written by Townshend for the British music paper ''[[Melody Maker]]''. The column provided Townshend's perspective on an array of subjects, such as the media and the state of US concert halls and public address systems, as well as providing valuable insight into Townshend's mindset during the evolution of his ''Lifehouse'' project.\n\nTownshend also wrote three sizeable essays for ''Rolling Stone'' magazine, the first of which appeared in November 1970. [https://web.archive.org/web/20150504100344/http://thewho.net/articles/townshen/rs_1970.htm In Love With Meher Baba] described Townshend's spiritual leanings. \"Meaty, Beaty, Big and Bouncy\", a blow-by-blow account of the Who compilation album of the same name, followed in December 1971. The third article, \"The Punk Meets the Godmother\", appeared in November 1977.\n\nAlso in 1977, Townshend founded [[Eel Pie Publishing]], which specialised in children's titles, music books, and several Meher Baba-related publications. He also opened a bookstore named Magic Bus (after the popular Who song) in London. ''The Story of Tommy'', a book written by Townshend and his art school friend [[Richard Barnes (author)|Richard Barnes]] (now the Who's official biographer) about the writing of Townshend's 1969 rock opera and the making of the 1975 [[Ken Russell]]-directed film, was published by Eel Pie the same year.\n\nIn July 1983, Townshend took a position as an [[Commissioning editor|acquisitions editor]] for London publisher [[Faber and Faber]]. Notable projects included editing [[The Animals|Animals]] frontman [[Eric Burdon]]'s autobiography, [[Charles Shaar Murray]]'s award-winning ''Crosstown Traffic: Jimi Hendrix and Post-War Pop'', [[Brian Eno]] and [[Russell Mills (artist)|Russell Mills]]'s ''[[More Dark Than Shark]]'', and working with [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Prince Charles]] on a volume of his collected speeches. Townshend commissioned [[Dave Rimmer]]'s ''[[Like Punk Never Happened]]'', and was [[commissioning editor]] for radical playwright [[Steven Berkoff]].\n\nTwo years after joining Faber and Faber, Townshend decided to publish a book of his own. ''[[Horse's Neck (book)|Horse's Neck]]'', issued in May 1985, was a collection of short stories he'd written between 1979 and 1984, tackling subjects such as childhood, stardom and spirituality. As a result of his position with Faber and Faber, Townshend developed friendships with both Nobel prize-winning author of ''[[Lord of the Flies]]'', Sir [[William Golding]], and British [[Poet Laureate]] [[Ted Hughes]]. His friendship with Hughes led to Townshend's musical interpretation of Hughes's children's story ''The Iron Man'', six years later, as ''[[The Iron Man: The Musical by Pete Townshend]]'', released in 1989.\n\nTownshend has written several scripts spanning the breadth of his career, including numerous drafts of his elusive ''Lifehouse'' project, the last of which, co-written with radio playwright Jeff Young, was published in 1999. In 1978, Townshend wrote a script for ''Fish Shop'', a play commissioned but not completed by [[London Weekend Television]], and in mid-1984 he wrote a script for ''[[White City: A Novel]]'' which led to a short film.\n\nIn 1989 Townshend began work on a novel entitled ''Ray High & The Glass Household'', a draft of which was later submitted to his editor. While the original novel remains unpublished, elements from this story were used in Townshend's 1993 solo album ''[[Psychoderelict]]''. In 1993, Townshend authored another book, ''[[The Who's Tommy]]'', a chronicle of the development of the award-winning [[Broadway (theatre)|Broadway]] version of his rock opera.\n\nThe opening of his personal website and his commerce site [https://web.archive.org/web/20100830082759/http://www.eelpie.com/ Eelpie.com], both in 2000, gave Townshend another outlet for literary work. Several of Townshend's essays have been posted online, including \"Meher Baba\u2014The Silent Master: My Own Silence\" in 2001, and \"A ''Different'' Bomb\", an indictment of the [[child pornography]] industry, the following year.\n\nIn September 2005, Townshend began posting a novella online entitled ''[[The Boy Who Heard Music]]'' as background for a musical of the same name. He posted a chapter each week until it was completed, and novella was available to read at his website for several months. Like ''Psychoderelict'', it was yet another extrapolation of ''Lifehouse'' and ''Ray High & The Glass Household''.\n\nIn 1997 Townshend signed a deal with [[Little, Brown and Company]] publishing to write his autobiography, reportedly titled ''Pete Townshend: Who He?'' Townshend's creative vagaries and conceptual machinations have been chronicled by Larry David Smith in his book ''The Minstrel's Dilemma'' ([[Praeger Publishers|Praeger]] 1999). After a lengthy delay, Townshend's autobiography, now titled ''[[Who I Am (book)|Who I Am]]'', was released 8 October 2012.<ref>Townshend, Pete.

The Who were renowned as a very loud band in their live performances; some particular incidents include a Who concert at the [[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton Athletic Football Club]], London, on 31 May 1976 that was listed as the \"Loudest Concert Ever\" by the [[Guinness World Records|Guinness Book of Records]], where the volume level was measured at 126 [[decibel]]s 32 metres from the stage. Townshend has also attributed the start of his hearing loss to Keith Moon's famous exploding drum set during the Who's 1967 appearance on ''[[The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour]]''.<ref>{{cite magazine | last=Grow | first=Kory | date=4 March 2016 | title=Flashback: Watch the Who Blow Up 'Smothers Brothers' in Primetime | magazine=[[Rolling Stone]] | url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/flashback-the-who-blow-up-smothers-brothers-in-primetime-20160304 | access-date=15 August 2016 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1989, Townshend gave the initial funding to allow the formation of the non-profit hearing advocacy group [[H.E.A.R.]] (Hearing Education and Awareness for Rockers). After the Who performed at half-time at [[Super Bowl XLIV]], Townshend stated that he is concerned that his tinnitus has grown to such a point that he might be forced to discontinue performing with the band altogether. He told ''Rolling Stone'', \"If my hearing is going to be a problem, we're not delaying shows. We're ''finished''. I can't really see any way around the issue.\" [[Neil Young]] introduced him to an [[Audiology|audiologist]] who suggested he use an [[in-ear monitor]], and although they cancelled their spring 2010 touring schedule, Townshend used the device at their one remaining London concert on 30 March 2010, to ascertain the feasibility of Townshend continuing to perform with the Who.<ref name=\"Tinnitus RS1\">{{cite web|last=Kreps|first=Daniel|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/rockdaily/index.php/2010/02/18/the-whos-future-uncertain-as-townshends-tinnitus-returns/|title=The Who's Future Uncertain as Townshend's Tinnitus Returns|date=8 February 2010|work=Rolling Stone|accessdate=21 February 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn March 2011, Roger Daltrey said in an interview with the [[BBC]] that Townshend had recently experienced gradual but severe [[hearing loss]] and was now trying to save what remained of his hearing: \"Pete's having terrible trouble with his hearing. He's got really, really bad problems with it...not [[tinnitus]], it's deterioration and he's seriously now worried about actually losing his hearing.\"\n\nReferring to that, in July 2011, Townshend wrote at his blog: \"My hearing is actually better than ever because after a feedback scare at the [[indigO2]] in December 2008 I am taking good care of it. I have computer systems in my studio that have helped me do my engineering work on the forthcoming Quadrophenia release. I have had assistance from younger forensic engineers and mastering engineers to help me clean up the high frequencies that are out of my range. The same computer systems work wonderfully well on stage, proving to be perfect for me when the Who performed at the Super Bowl and doing Quadrophenia for [[Teenage Cancer Trust|TCT]] at the [[Royal Albert Hall]] in 2010. I'm 66, I don't have perfect hearing, and if I listen to loud music or go to gigs I do tend to get tinnitus.\"\n\n===Political views===\nIn 1998, Townshend was named in a list of the biggest private financial donors to the [[Labour Party (UK)|UK Labour Party]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/161057.stm |title='Luvvies' for Labour |work=BBC News |date=30 August 1998 |accessdate=22 May 2010}}</ref> He refused to let [[Michael Moore]] use \"[[Won't Get Fooled Again]]\" in ''[[Fahrenheit 9/11]]'', saying that he watched ''[[Bowling for Columbine]]'' and was not convinced.<ref>{{cite web|last=Rashbaum |first=Alyssa |date=13 July 2004 |title=Pete Townshend Says Don't Be 'Fooled' By Michael Moore |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1489389/20040713/who.jhtml?headlines=true |publisher=MTV |accessdate=8 December 2012}}</ref>\nIn 1961 while in art school, Townshend joined the [[Young Communist League (UK)|Young Communist League]] and was a prominent figure in their 1966 \"Trend\" recruitment campaign.

His first solo concert, for example, was a 1974 benefit show which was organised to raise funds for the Camden Square Community Play Centre.\n\nThe earliest public example of Townshend's involvement with charitable causes was in 1968, when Townshend donated the use of his former Wardour Street apartment to the Meher Baba Association. The following year, the association was moved to another Townshend-owned apartment, the Eccleston Square former residence of his wife Karen. Townshend sat on a committee which oversaw the operation and finances of the centre. \"The committee sees to it that it is open a couple of days a week, and keeps the bills paid and the library full\", he wrote in a 1970 ''Rolling Stone'' article.\n\nIn 1969 and 1972, Townshend produced two limited-release albums, ''Happy Birthday'' and ''I Am'', for the London-based Baba association. This led to 1972's ''Who Came First'', a more widespread release, 15 percent of the revenue of which went to the Baba association. A further limited release, ''With Love'', was released in 1976. A limited-edition boxed set of all three limited releases on CD, ''Avatar'', was released in 2000, with all profits going to the [[Avatar Meher Baba Trust]] in India, which provided funds to a dispensary, school, hospital and pilgrimage centre.\n\nIn July 1976, Townshend opened Meher Baba Oceanic, a London activity centre for Baba followers, which featured film dubbing and editing facilities, a cinema and a recording studio. In addition, the centre served as a regular meeting place for Baba followers. Townshend offered very economical (reportedly \u00a31 per night) lodging for American followers who needed an overnight stay on their pilgrimages to India. Townshend wrote in a 1977 ''Rolling Stone'' article: {{quote|For a few years, I had toyed with the idea of opening a London house dedicated to Meher Baba. In the eight years I had followed him, I had donated only coppers to foundations set up around the world to carry out the Master's wishes and decided it was about time I put myself on the line. The Who had set up a strong charitable trust of its own which appeased, to an extent, the feeling I had that Meher Baba would rather have seen me give to the poor than to the establishment of yet another so-called 'spiritual center'.}} Townshend also embarked on a project dedicated to the collection, restoration and maintenance of Meher Baba-related films. The project was known as MEFA, or Meher Baba European Film Archive.\n\n===Children's charities===\nTownshend has been an active champion of children's charities. The debut of Pete Townshend's stage version of ''[[Tommy (rock opera)|Tommy]]'' took place at San Diego's [[La Jolla Playhouse]] in July 1992. The show was earmarked as a benefit for the London-based [[Nordoff\u2013Robbins music therapy|Nordoff-Robbins]] Music Therapy Foundation, an organisation which helps children with [[autism]] and [[intellectual disability]].\n\nTownshend performed at a 1995 benefit organised by [[Paul Simon]] at [[Madison Square Garden]]'s Paramount Theatre for the [[Children's Health Fund]]. The following year, Townshend performed at a benefit for the annual [[Bridge School Benefit]], a California facility for children with severe speech and physical impairments, with concerts organised by [[Neil Young|Neil]] and [[Pegi Young]]. In 1997, Townshend established a relationship with [[Maryville Academy]], a Chicago area children's charity. Between 1997 and 2002, Townshend played five benefit shows for Maryville Academy, raising at least $1,600,000. His 1998 album ''[[A Benefit for Maryville Academy]]'' was made to support their activities and proceeds from the sales of his release were donated to them.\n\nAs a member of [[the Who]], Townshend has also performed a series of concerts, beginning in 2000 to benefit the [[Teenage Cancer Trust]] in the UK, which raised several million pounds. In 2005, Townshend performed at New York's [[Gotham Hall]] for Samsung's Four Seasons of Hope, an annual children's charity fundraiser. In the same year, he donated a smashed guitar to the Pediatric Epilepsy Project.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.modernguitars.com/archives/001029.html |title=Pete Townshend Smashes Guitar... for Charity |work=Modern Guitars |date=12 August 2005 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051119144842/http://www.modernguitars.com/archives/001029.html |archivedate=19 November 2005}}</ref>\n\nOn 4 November 2011, Roger Daltrey and Pete Townshend launched the Daltrey/Townshend Teen and Young Adult Cancer Program at the [[Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center]] in Los Angeles, to be funded by the Who's charity Who Cares. The launch, followed on 5 November by a fund-raising event, was also attended by [[Robert Plant]] and [[Dave Grohl]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sacbee.com/2011/11/04/4031201/the-who-launch-teen-cancer-program.html|title=The Who launch teen cancer program at LA hospital|work=The Sacramento Bee|date=4 November 2011|accessdate=4 November 2011}}{{Dead link|date=December 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Drug rehabilitation===\nTownshend has also advocated for [[drug rehabilitation]]. In a 1985 radio interview, he said:\n\n{{quote|What I'm most active in doing is raising money to provide beds in clinics to help people that have become victims of drug abuse. In Britain, the facilities are very, very, very lean indeed&nbsp;... although we have a national health service, a free medical system, it does nothing particularly for [[List of controlled drugs in the United Kingdom|class A]] drug addicts \u2013 [[cocaine]] abusers, heroin abusers&nbsp;... we're making a lot of progress&nbsp;... the British government embarked on an anti-heroin campaign with advertising, and I was co-opted by them as a kind of figurehead, and then the various other people co-opted me into their own campaigns, but my main work is raising money to try and open a large clinic.}}\n\nThe \"large clinic\" Townshend was referring to was a plan he and drug rehabilitation experimenter [[Meg Patterson]] had devised to open a drug treatment facility in London; however, the plan failed to come to fruition. Two early 1979 concerts by the Who raised \u00a320,000 for Patterson's Pharmakon Clinic in [[Sussex]].\n\nFurther examples of Townshend's drug rehabilitation activism took place in the form of a 1984 [[benefit concert]] (incidentally the first live performance of Manchester band [[the Stone Roses]]), an article he wrote a few days later for Britain's ''[[Mail on Sunday]]'' urging better care for the nation's growing number of drug addicts, and the formation of a charitable organisation, Double-O Charities, to raise funds for the causes he'd recently championed. Townshend also personally sold fund-raising anti-heroin T-shirts at a series of UK [[Bruce Springsteen]] concerts and reportedly financed a trip for former [[The Clash|Clash]] drummer [[Topper Headon]] to undergo drug rehabilitation treatment. Townshend's 1985\u201386 band, Deep End, played two benefits at [[Brixton Academy]] in 1985 for Double-O Charities.\n\n===Amnesty International===\nIn 1979 Townshend donated his services to the human rights organisation [[Amnesty International]] when he performed three songs for its benefit show ''[[The Secret Policeman's Ball (1979)|The Secret Policeman's Ball]]'' \u2013 performances that were released on record and seen in the film of the show. Townshend's acoustic performances of three of his songs (\"[[Pinball Wizard]]\", \"Drowned\", and \"[[Won't Get Fooled Again]]\") were subsequently cited as forerunners and inspiration for the \"[[Acoustic Music|unplugged]]\" phenomenon in the 1990s.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.secretpolicemansball.com/schedule.200906131930e.html |title=The Secret Policeman's Film Festival |year=2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090618062059/http://www.secretpolicemansball.com/schedule.200906131930e.html |archivedate=18 June 2009}}</ref>\n\nTownshend had been invited to perform for Amnesty by [[Martin Lewis (humorist)|Martin Lewis]], the producer of ''[[The Secret Policeman's Ball (1979)|The Secret Policeman's Ball]]'', who stated later that Townshend's participation had been the key to his securing the subsequent participation for Amnesty (in the 1981 sequel show) of [[Sting (musician)|Sting]], [[Eric Clapton]], [[Jeff Beck]], [[Phil Collins]] and [[Bob Geldof]]. Other performers inspired to support Amnesty International in future ''[[The Secret Policeman's Ball (1979)|Secret Policeman's Ball]]'' shows and other benefits because of Townshend's early commitment to the organisation include [[Peter Gabriel]], [[Bruce Springsteen]], [[David Gilmour]] and [[U2]]'s lead singer [[Bono]] who in 1986 told ''Rolling Stone'' magazine: \"I saw ''The Secret Policeman's Ball'' and it became a part of me.

Pianist Andy Newman (an old art school friend), drummer [[Speedy Keen|John \"Speedy\" Keen]] (who had written \"Armenia City in the Sky\" for the Who to record for their 1967 album ''[[The Who Sell Out]]'') and teenage guitarist [[Jimmy McCulloch]] (later to join [[Wings (band)|Wings]]). Townshend produced the band and played bass on their recordings under the tongue-in-cheek pseudonym \"Bijou Drains\". Their first recording was the single \"[[Something in the Air (song)|Something in the Air]]\", which became a number one hit in the UK and a substantial hit elsewhere in the world. This was the only number one hit in the UK that Townshend performed on. (The Who had none.)<ref name=\"songfacts1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.songfacts.com/detail.php?id=4148 |title=Something in the Air by Thunderclap Newman Songfacts |website=Songfacts.com |accessdate=15 May 2011}}</ref> Following this success, Townshend produced their sole album, ''Hollywood Dream''.\n\nTownshend also produced \"[[Fire (Arthur Brown song)|Fire]]\" by [[the Crazy World of Arthur Brown]] in 1968 that was No. 1 in the UK and No. 2 in the US and was also an executive-producer on the band's debut album, also called ''[[The Crazy World of Arthur Brown (album)|The Crazy World of Arthur Brown]]''.<ref name=\"songfacts1\"/>\n\nIn 1971 Townshend, along with [[Keith Moon]] and [[Ronnie Lane]], backed [[Mike Heron]] (of the [[Incredible String Band]]) on one song \"Warm Heart Pastry\" from Heron's first solo LP, ''[[Smiling Men with Bad Reputations]]''. On the album notes, they are listed as \"Tommy and the Bijoux\". Also present on the track was [[John Cale]] on viola.\n\nIn 1984 Townshend contributed lyrics to the track \"I'm the Answer\" on his brother [[Simon Townshend|Simon]]'s debut solo album ''[[Sweet Sound]]'' which was released as a single and features Townshend and Simon on an interview that wrongly names that the track was by \"Peter Townshend\".\n\nIn 1984 Townshend contributed lyrics to two songs (\"Love on the Air\" and \"All Lovers are Deranged\") on [[David Gilmour]]'s solo album ''[[About Face (album)|About Face]]''.\n\nThrough much of 2005, Pete Townshend recorded and performed alongside his girlfriend [[Rachel Fuller]], a classically trained pianist and singer-songwriter.\n\nIn 2006 Townshend opened a website for implementation of [[The Lifehouse Method]] based on his 1971 ''[[Lifehouse (rock opera)|Lifehouse]]'' concept. This website was in collaboration with composer [[Lawrence Ball]] and software developer David Snowden, with instrumentation by Steve Hills.

He is best known for his more than 50 year association with the rock band [[The Who]], as co-founder and leader, principal songwriter, guitarist, and vocalist. The Who is considered to be one of the most important and influential rock bands of the 20th century.<ref name=\"BBC News\">{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-29374342 |title=The Who unveil first new song in eight years |work=BBC News |date=26 September 2014 |accessdate=5 June 2015}}</ref><ref>[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/642975/the-Who The Who]. ''[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]''</ref>\n\nTownshend has written more than 100 songs for 12 The Who studio albums. These include [[concept album]]s, the [[rock opera]]s ''[[Tommy (The Who album)|Tommy]]'' and ''[[Quadrophenia]]'', plus popular [[rock music|rock]] radio staples such as ''[[Who's Next]]''; as well as dozens more that appeared as non-album singles, bonus tracks on reissues, and  tracks on rarities compilations such as ''[[Odds & Sods]]'' (1974). He has also written more than 100 songs that have appeared on his solo albums, as well as [[radio jingles]] and [[Theme music|television theme songs]].\n \nAs an instrumentalist, although known primarily as a guitarist, Townshend also plays keyboards, [[banjo]], [[accordion]], [[harmonica]], [[ukulele]], [[mandolin]], violin, [[synthesiser]], bass guitar, and drums. He is self-taught on all of these instruments. He plays on his own solo albums, several The Who albums, and as a guest contributor to an array of other artists' recordings.  \n\nTownshend has also contributed to and authored many newspaper and magazine articles, book reviews, essays, books, and scripts, and he has collaborated as a lyricist and composer for many other musical acts. Due to his aggressive playing style and innovative songwriting techniques, Townshend's works with The Who and in other projects have earned him critical acclaim.\n\nIn 1983, Townshend received the [[Brit Awards|Brit Award]] for Lifetime Achievement and in 1990 he was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] as a member of the Who.

He came from a musical family: his father, [[Cliff Townshend]], was a professional alto saxophonist in the [[Royal Air Force]]'s dance band [[the Squadronaires]] and his mother, Betty (n\u00e9e Dennis), was a singer with the Sydney Torch and Les Douglass Orchestras.{{sfn|Giuliano|2002|p=2}} The Townshends had a volatile marriage, as both drank heavily and possessed fiery tempers. Cliff Townshend was often away from his family touring with his band while Betty carried on affairs with other men. The two split when Townshend was a toddler and he was sent to live with his maternal grandmother Emma Dennis, whom Pete later described as \"clinically insane\". The two-year separation ended when Cliff and Betty purchased a house together on Woodgrange Avenue in middle-class [[Acton, London|Acton]], and the young Pete was happily reunited with his parents.{{sfn|Wilkerson|2006|p=6}} His neighbourhood was one-third Polish, and a devout Jewish family upstairs shared their housing with them and cooking with them\u2014many of his father's closest friends were Jewish.<ref name=\"The Secret Jewish History of The Who\">{{Cite web |url=https://forward.com/culture/music/434550/whos-jewish/ |title=The Secret Jewish History of The Who |last=Rogovoy |first=Seth |date=2019-11-12 |website=The Forward |access-date=2019-11-12}}</ref>\n\nTownshend says he did not have many friends growing up, so he spent much of his boyhood reading adventure novels like ''[[Gulliver's Travels]]'' and ''[[Treasure Island]]''.{{sfn|Giuliano|2002|p=8}} He enjoyed his family's frequent excursions to the seaside and the [[Isle of Man]]. It was on one of these trips in the summer of 1956 that he repeatedly watched the 1956 film [[Rock Around the Clock (film)|''Rock Around the Clock'']], sparking his fascination with American [[rock and roll]].{{sfn|Giuliano|2002|p=12}} Not long thereafter, he went to see [[Bill Haley (musician)|Bill Haley]] perform in London, Townshend's first concert.{{sfn|Wilkerson|2006|p=8}} At the time, he did not see himself pursuing a career as a professional musician; instead, he wanted to become a journalist.{{sfn|Giuliano|2002|p=7}}\n\nUpon passing the [[eleven-plus]] exam, Townshend was enrolled at [[Acton County Grammar School]].{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=19}} At Acton County, he was frequently bullied because he had a large nose, an experience that profoundly affected him.{{sfn|Wilkerson|2006|p=9}} His grandmother Emma purchased his first guitar for Christmas in 1956, an inexpensive Spanish model.{{sfn|Wilkerson|2006|p=10}} Though his father taught him a couple of chords, Townshend was largely self-taught on the instrument and never learned to read music.{{sfn|Giuliano|2002|p=13}} Townshend and school friend [[John Entwistle]] formed a short-lived [[trad jazz]] group, the Confederates, featuring Townshend on banjo and Entwistle on horns.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=26}} The Confederates played gigs at the Congo Club, a youth club run by the Acton Congregational Church, and covered [[Acker Bilk]], [[Kenny Ball]], and [[Lonnie Donegan]].{{sfn|Giuliano|2002|p=15}} However, both became influenced by the increasing popularity of [[rock 'n' roll]], with Townshend particularly admiring [[Cliff Richard]]'s debut single, \"[[Move It]]\".{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2009|p=17}} Townshend left the Confederates after getting into a fight with the group's drummer, Chris Sherwin, and purchased a \"reasonably good Czechoslovakian guitar\" at his mother's antique shop.{{sfn|Wilkerson|2006|p=12}}\n\nTownshend's brothers Paul and [[Simon Townshend|Simon]] were born in 1957 and 1960, respectively.{{sfn|Wilkerson|2006|p=7}} Lacking the requisite test scores to attend university, Pete was faced with the decision of art school, music school, or getting a job.{{sfn|Giuliano|2002|p=19}} He ultimately chose to study [[graphic design]] at [[Ealing Art College]], enrolling in 1961. At Ealing, Townshend studied alongside future [[The Rolling Stones|Rolling Stones]] guitarist [[Ronnie Wood]].

The new bass player then suggested Townshend join as an additional guitarist.{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2009|p=18}} In the early days of the Detours, the band's repertoire consisted of instrumentals by [[the Shadows]] and [[the Ventures]], as well as pop and trad jazz covers. Their lineup coalesced around [[Roger Daltrey]] on lead guitar, Townshend on rhythm guitar, Entwistle on bass, [[Doug Sandom]] on drums and Colin Dawson as vocalist.{{sfn|Giuliano|2002|p=22}} Daltrey was considered the leader of the group and, according to Townshend, \"ran things the way he wanted them.\"{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2009|p=22}} Dawson quit in 1962 after arguing too much with Daltrey, who subsequently moved to lead vocalist. As a result, Townshend, with Entwistle's encouragement, became the sole guitarist. Through Townshend's mother, the group obtained a management contract with local promoter Robert Druce,{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2009|p=21}} who started booking the band as a support act for bands including [[Screaming Lord Sutch]], [[Cliff Bennett and the Rebel Rousers]], [[Shane Fenton and the Fentones]], and [[Johnny Kidd (singer)|Johnny Kidd]] and the Pirates.{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2009|p=24}} In 1963, Townshend's father arranged an amateur recording of \"It Was You\", the first song his son ever wrote.{{sfn|Giuliano|2002|p=40}} The Detours became aware of a group of the same name in February 1964, forcing them to change their name.{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2009|p=26}} Townshend's roommate [[Richard Barnes (author)|Richard Barnes]] came up with \"The Who\", and Daltrey decided it was the best choice.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=66}}\n\n===1964\u20131982: The Who===\n{{main|The Who}}\n[[File:Pete Townshend and Keith Moon 1967.jpg|thumb|190px|right|Townshend (with Moon, rear right) backstage before a gig at [[Friedrich-Ebert-Halle]] in [[Ludwigshafen|Ludwigshafen, Germany]] on 12 April 1967]]\n\nNot long after the name change, drummer [[Doug Sandom]] was replaced by [[Keith Moon]], who had been drumming semi-professionally with the Beachcombers for several years.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=80}} The band was soon taken on by a [[Mod (subculture)|mod]] publicist named [[Peter Meaden]] who convinced them to change their name to the High Numbers to give the band more of a mod feel. After bringing out one failed single (\"I'm the Face/Zoot Suit\"), they dropped Meaden and were signed on by two new managers, [[Chris Stamp]] and [[Kit Lambert]], who had paired up with the intention of finding new talent and creating a documentary about them.{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2009|p=55}} The band anguished over a name that all felt represented the band best, and dropped the High Numbers name, reverting to the Who.{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2009|p=60}} In June 1964, during a performance at the Railway Tavern, Townshend accidentally broke the top of his guitar on the low ceiling and proceeded to destroy the entire instrument.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=125}} The on-stage destruction of instruments soon became a regular part of the Who's live shows.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=126}}\n\nWith the assistance of Lambert, the Who caught the ear of American record producer [[Shel Talmy]], who had the band signed to a record contract. Townshend wrote a song, \"[[I Can't Explain]]\", as a deliberate sound-alike of [[the Kinks]], another group Talmy produced. Released as a single in January 1965, \"I Can't Explain\" was the Who's first hit, reaching number eight on the British charts.{{sfn|Wilkerson|2006|p=40}} A follow-up single (\"[[Anyway, Anyhow, Anywhere]]\"), credited to both Townshend and Daltrey, also reached the top 10 in the UK.{{sfn|Howard|2004|pp=107\u2013108}} However, it was the release of the Who's third single, \"[[My Generation]]\", in November that, according to Who biographer Mark Wilkerson, \"cemented their reputation as a hard-nosed band who reflected the feelings of thousands of pissed-off adolescents at the time.\"{{sfn|Wilkerson|2006|p=52}} The Townshend-penned single reached number two on the UK charts, becoming the Who's biggest hit. The song and its famous line \"I hope I die before I get old\" was \"very much about trying to find a place in society\", Townshend stated in an interview with [[David Fricke]].{{sfn|Wilkerson|2006|p=53}}\n\nTo capitalise on their recent single success, the Who's debut album ''[[My Generation (album)|My Generation]]'' (''The Who Sings My Generation'' in the US) was released in late 1965, containing original material written by Townshend and several [[James Brown]] covers that Daltrey favoured.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/the-who-sings-my-generation-mw0000020578|title=My Generation&nbsp;\u2013 review|first=Richie|last=Unterberger|website=[[AllMusic]]|accessdate=19 September 2013}}</ref> Townshend continued to write several successful singles for the band, including \"[[Pictures of Lily]]\", \"[[Substitute (The Who song)|Substitute]]\", \"[[I'm a Boy]]\", and \"[[Happy Jack (song)|Happy Jack]]\".{{sfn|Giuliano|2002|p=63}} Lambert encouraged Townshend to write longer pieces of music for the next album, which became the \"[[A Quick One, While He's Away]]\".

[[Leonard Bernstein]] praised the album, saying its \"sheer power, invention and brilliance of performance outstrips anything which has ever come out of a recording studio.\"{{sfn|Giuliano|2002|p=90}} In support of ''Tommy'', the Who launched a tour that included a memorable appearance at the [[Woodstock Festival]] on 17 August.

Among his most well-known accomplishments are the creation of a second pioneering rock opera, ''[[Quadrophenia]]''; his dramatic stage persona; his use of guitar feedback as sonic technique; and the introduction of the synthesiser as a rock instrument. Townshend revisited album-length storytelling throughout his career and remains the musician most associated with the rock opera form.

According to Townshend, postwar trauma was the driving force behind the rock music revolution in the UK. \"Trauma is passed from generation to generation\", he said, \"I've unwittingly inherited what my father experienced.\"<ref>{{citation |last=Kelts |first=Roland |date=9 October 2012 |title=Pete Townshend\u2019s War |url=http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/pete-townshends-war |work=The New Yorker |accessdate=20 August 2015}}</ref> Townshend notes that growing up in this period produced the narrative that runs through his music of a boy lost in the stresses and pressures of postwar life.<ref>{{citation |last=Victoriano |first=Camila |date=16 October 2012 |title=Townshend Talks Postwar Lyricism |url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/10/16/pete-townshend-who-berklee |work=[[The Harvard Crimson]] |accessdate=20 August 2015}}</ref> In his autobiography, he wrote: {{quote|I wasn't trying to play beautiful music.

Townshend's roommate at Ealing Art College, Tom Wright, had a large record collection, and Townshend listened to and became influenced by R&B and rock & roll artists like [[Howlin' Wolf]], [[John Lee Hooker]], [[Bo Diddley]], [[Booker T. & the MGs]], [[Little Walter]], and [[Chuck Berry]].{{sfn|Wilkerson|2006|p=16}} He was also strongly influenced by cellist [[Malcolm Cecil]], who often damaged his cello during performances, along with [[Gustav Metzger]], pioneer of [[auto-destructive art]]. In light of these influences, guitar smashing became not just an expression of youthful angst, but also a means of conveying ideas through musical performance. \"We advanced a new concept\", he writes. \"Destruction is art when set to music.\"<ref name=art />\n\n==Equipment==\n{{BLP sources section|date=July 2012}}\n{{See also|The Who's musical equipment}}\n\n===Guitars and amplifiers===\n[[File:BouncingTownshend.jpg|thumb|230px|right|Townshend leaping into air in concert]]\nThroughout his solo career and his career with the Who, Townshend has played a large variety of guitars&nbsp;\u2013 mostly various [[Gibson Guitar Corporation|Gibson]], [[Fender Musical Instruments Corporation|Fender]] and [[Rickenbacker]] models. He has also used [[Guild Guitar Company|Guild]], [[Takamine Guitars|Takamine]] and [[Gibson J-200]] [[Acoustic guitar|acoustic]] models, with the J-200 providing his signature recorded acoustic sound in such songs as \"[[Pinball Wizard]]\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.musicradar.com/reviews/gibson-montana-sj-200-standard|title=Gibson Montana SJ 200 Standard review|first=Acoustic Magazine 2018-05-05T13:33:44 124Z Acoustic|last=Guitars|website=MusicRadar.com}}</ref>\n\nIn the early days with the Who, Townshend played an Emile Grimshaw SS De Luxe and 6-string and 12-string Rickenbacker semi-hollow electric guitars primarily (particularly the Rose-Morris UK-imported models with special f-holes). When the excited audience responded enthusiastically after he accidentally broke the head off his guitar on a low ceiling during a concert at the Railway Hotel pub in [[Wealdstone]], west London, he incorporated the eventual smashing of his instrument into the band's performances.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/articles/p/pete-townshends-guitar/|title=Pete Townshend's Guitar|first=Online Museum|last=Victoria and Albert Museum|date=3 May 2011|website=Vam.ac.uk|accessdate=12 May 2019}}</ref> However, as [[Smashing guitars|instrument-smashing]] became increasingly integrated into the Who's concert sets, he switched to more durable and resilient (and, importantly, cheaper) guitars for smashing, such as the [[Fender Stratocaster]], [[Fender Telecaster]] and various [[Danelectro]] models.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.thewho.net/whotabs/gear/guitar/danelectro.html|title=Danelectro Guitars &#124; Pete Townshend\u2019s Guitar Gear &#124; Whotabs|website=Thewho.net}}</ref> On the Who's ''[[Smothers Brothers#The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour|The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour]]'' appearance in 1967, Townshend used a [[Vox (musical equipment)|Vox]] Cheetah guitar,<ref name=\"auto\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.guitarplayer.com/technique/10-things-you-gotta-do-to-play-like-pete-townshend-tab|title=10 Things You Gotta Do To Play Like Pete Townshend|first=Jesse|last=Gress|website=GuitarPlayer.com}}</ref> which he only used for that performance; and the guitar was destroyed by Townshend and Moon's drum explosion. In the late 1960s, Townshend began playing [[Gibson SG]] Special models almost exclusively. He used this guitar at the [[Woodstock]] and [[Isle of Wight]] shows in 1969 and 1970, as well as the ''[[Live at Leeds]]'' performance in 1970.\n\nBy 1970 [[Gibson Guitar Corporation|Gibson]] changed the design of the SG Special which Townshend had been using previously, and he began using other guitars. For much of the 1970s, he used a [[Gibson Les Paul#Deluxe|Gibson Les Paul Deluxe]], some with only two mini-[[humbucker]] pick-ups and others modified with a third pick-up in the \"middle position\" (a [[DiMarzio]] Superdistortion / Dual Sound). He can be seen using several of these guitars in the documentary ''The Kids Are Alright'', although in the studio he often played a '59 [[Gretsch 6120]] guitar (given to him by [[Joe Walsh]]),<ref name=\"auto\"/> most notably on the albums ''[[Who's Next]]'' and ''[[Quadrophenia]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.guitarworld.com/gear/the-secrets-behind-pete-townshends-tone-on-the-whos-wont-get-fooled-again|title=The secrets behind Pete Townshend's tone on The Who's Won't Get Fooled Again|first=Chris|last=Gill 2019-07-08T18:36:48Z|website=Guitarworld.com|accessdate=4 February 2020}}</ref>\n\nDuring the 1980s, Townshend mainly used Fenders, Rickenbackers and Telecaster-style models built for him by [[Schecter Guitar Research|Schecter]] and various other [[luthier]]s. Since the late-1980s, Townshend has used the [[Eric Clapton Stratocaster|Fender Eric Clapton Signature Stratocaster]], with [[Lace Sensor]] pick-ups,<ref name=\"auto\"/> both in the studio and on tour. Some of his Stratocaster guitars feature a Fishman PowerBridge piezo pick-up system to simulate acoustic guitar tones. This piezo system is controlled by an extra volume control behind the guitar's bridge.\n\nDuring the Who's 1989 Tour Townshend played a Rickenbacker guitar that was ironically smashed accidentally when he tripped over it. Instead of throwing the smashed parts away, Townshend reassembled the pieces as a sculpture.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.guitarplayer.com/players/pete-townshends-smashed-rickenbacker-takes-more-than-78k-at-auction|title=Pete Townshend\u2019s Smashed Rickenbacker Takes More Than $78K at Auction|first=Christopher|last=Scapelliti|website=GuitarPlayer.com}}</ref> The sculpture was featured at the ''Rock Stars, Cars And Guitars 2'' exhibit during the summer of 2009 at [[The Henry Ford]] museum.\n\n[[File:Pete Townshend 2007.jpg|thumb|right|190px|Townshend playing a Fender [[Eric Clapton Signature Stratocaster]]]]\n\nThere are several [[Gibson Guitar Corporation|Gibson]] Pete Townshend signature guitars, such as the Pete Townshend SG, the Pete Townshend J-200, and three different Pete Townshend Les Paul Deluxes. The SG was clearly marked as a Pete Townshend limited edition model and came with a special case and certificate of authenticity, signed by Townshend himself. There has also been a Pete Townshend signature [[Rickenbacker]] limited edition guitar of the model 1998, which was his main 6-string guitar in the Who's early days. The run featured 250 guitars which were made between July 1987 \u2013 March 1988, and according to Rickenbacker CEO John Hall, the entire run sold out before serious advertising could be done.\n\nHe also used the [[Gibson ES-335]], one of which he donated to the Hard Rock Cafe. Townshend also used a [[Gibson EDS-1275]] double-neck very briefly circa late 1967, and both a [[Harmony Company|Harmony]] Sovereign H1270<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thewho.net/whotabs/equipment/guitar/equip-harmony12.html |title=Pete's Equipment, Harmony Sovereign H-1270 12-string acoustic guitar, Whotabs, Pete Townshend |website=Thewho.net |accessdate=15 May 2011}}</ref> and a [[Fender Electric XII]] for the studio sessions for ''[[Tommy (rock opera)|Tommy]]'' for the 12-string guitar parts. He also occasionally used Fender Jazzmasters on stage in 1967 and 1968<ref>http://www.thewho.net/whotabs/gear/guitar/fenderjazzmaster.html</ref> and in the studio for ''Tommy''.\n\nIn 2006 Townshend had a pedalboard designed by long-time gear guru [[Pete Cornish]]. The board apparently is composed with a compressor, an old Boss OD-1 overdrive pedal, as well as a [[T-Rex Engineering|T-Rex]] Replica delay pedal.\n\n===Amps===\nOver the years, Townshend has used many types of amplifier, including [[Vox (musical equipment)|Vox]], [[Henri Selmer Paris|Selmer]], [[Fender Musical Instruments Corporation|Fender]], [[Marshall Amplification|Marshall]], [[Hiwatt]] etc., sticking to using Hiwatt amps for most of four decades. Around the time of ''[[Who's Next]]'', he used a tweed [[Fender Bandmaster]] amp (also given to him by Joe Walsh in 1970<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thewho.net/whotabs/gear/guitar/fenderbandmaster.html |title=Pete\u2019s Gear: 1959 Fender Bandmaster Amplifier|date= |access-date=4 January 2016}}</ref>), which he also used for ''[[Quadrophenia]]'' and ''[[The Who by Numbers]]''. While recording ''[[Face Dances]]'' and the collaborative album ''[[Rough Mix]]'', Townshend made use of a [[Peavey Electronics#Noteworthy products#Classic series guitar amplifiers|Peavey Vintage 4\u00d710]] amplifier in the studio. Since 1989, his rig consisted of four Fender Vibro-King stacks and a Hiwatt head driving two custom made 2\u00d712\" Hiwatt/Mesa Boogie speaker cabinets. However, since 2006, he has only three Vibro-King stacks, one of which is a backup.\n\nTownshend figured prominently in the development of what is widely known in rock circles as the \"[[Marshall stack]]\". He ordered several speaker cabinets that contained eight 12\" speakers in a housing standing nearly six feet in height with the top half of the cabinet slanted slightly upward. These were too heavy to move easily, so [[Jim Marshall (businessman)|Jim Marshall]] cut the massive speaker cabinet in half, at the suggestion of Townshend, with each cabinet containing four 12-inch speakers. One of the cabinets had half of the speaker baffle slanted upwards and Marshall made these two cabinets stackable. The Marshall stack was born, and Townshend used these as well as Hiwatt stacks.\n\nHe has always regarded his instruments as being merely tools of the trade <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.premierguitar.com/articles/Pete_Townshend_On_Guitar_Smashing_Regrets_Stylistic_Evolution_and_Becoming_a_Gear_Aficionado|title=Pete Townshend: On Guitar-Smashing Regrets, Stylistic Evolution, and Becoming a Gear Aficionado|website=Premierguitar.com|accessdate=12 May 2019}}</ref> and has, in latter years, kept his most prized instruments well away from the concert stage. These instruments include a few vintage and reissue Rickenbackers, the Gretsch 6120, an original 1952 [[Fender Telecaster]], Gibson Custom Shop's artist limited edition reissues of Townshend's Les Paul DeLuxe models 1, 3 and 9 as well his signature SG Special reissue.\n\n===Keyboards===\nTownshend played keyboards on several Who songs. On ''Who's Next'', he began to work with [[analogue synthesizer]]s, using the [[ARP 2600]] model that he first encountered at [[Cambridge University]].{{sfn|Giuliano|2002|p=95}} He had this to say about the instrument: \"I like synthesizers because they bring into my hands things that aren't in my hands: the sound of an orchestra, French horns, strings. There are gadgets on synthesizers that enable one to become a virtuoso on the keyboard. You can play something slowly and you press a switch and it plays it back at double speed. Whereas on the guitar you're stuck with as fast as you can play and I don't play fast, I just play hard. So when it goes to playing something fast I go to the synth.\"{{sfn|Giuliano|2002|p=96}}\n\nThe synths Townshend was referring to include the EMS [[VCS3]], the [[ARP Instruments, Inc.]] [[ARP 2600]], some of which modified a [[Lowrey organ|Lowrey TBO Berkshire organ]]. Current photos of his home studio also show an [[ARP 2500]]. Townshend was featured in ARP promotional materials in the early 1970s.\n\nSince the late 1980s Townshend has predominantly used [[Synclavier]] Digital Audio systems for keyboard composition, particularly solo albums and projects. He currently owns three systems, one large Synclavier 9600 Tapeless Studio system, originally installed in his riverside Oceanic Studio, later transferred to a seagoing barge moored alongside the studio on the River Thames, and currently based in his home studio. He also uses a special adapted smaller Synclavier 3200 system which can be transported, enabling him to carry on working away from his main studio. This 3200 system was modified to be of similar specification to the 9600, including the addition internally of FM voices, stereo Poly voices and with the large VPK keyboard. This is the only Synclavier 3200 system of this specification in existence, custom-designed and built for Townshend by Steve Hills. The third system Townshend owns is one of the first Synclavier II systems ever built. The ORK (original smaller) keyboard of which is on display in his company's head office alongside a pink [[Vespa]] scooter.\n\n==Literary work==\nAlthough known for his musical compositions and musicianship, Townshend has been extensively involved in the literary world for more than three decades, writing newspaper and magazine articles, book reviews, essays, books, and scripts.\n\nAn early example of Townshend's writing came in August 1970 with the first of nine instalments of \"The Pete Townshend Page\", a monthly column written by Townshend for the British music paper ''[[Melody Maker]]''. The column provided Townshend's perspective on an array of subjects, such as the media and the state of US concert halls and public address systems, as well as providing valuable insight into Townshend's mindset during the evolution of his ''Lifehouse'' project.\n\nTownshend also wrote three sizeable essays for ''Rolling Stone'' magazine, the first of which appeared in November 1970. [https://web.archive.org/web/20150504100344/http://thewho.net/articles/townshen/rs_1970.htm In Love With Meher Baba] described Townshend's spiritual leanings. \"Meaty, Beaty, Big and Bouncy\", a blow-by-blow account of the Who compilation album of the same name, followed in December 1971. The third article, \"The Punk Meets the Godmother\", appeared in November 1977.\n\nAlso in 1977, Townshend founded [[Eel Pie Publishing]], which specialised in children's titles, music books, and several Meher Baba-related publications. He also opened a bookstore named Magic Bus (after the popular Who song) in London. ''The Story of Tommy'', a book written by Townshend and his art school friend [[Richard Barnes (author)|Richard Barnes]] (now the Who's official biographer) about the writing of Townshend's 1969 rock opera and the making of the 1975 [[Ken Russell]]-directed film, was published by Eel Pie the same year.\n\nIn July 1983, Townshend took a position as an [[Commissioning editor|acquisitions editor]] for London publisher [[Faber and Faber]]. Notable projects included editing [[The Animals|Animals]] frontman [[Eric Burdon]]'s autobiography, [[Charles Shaar Murray]]'s award-winning ''Crosstown Traffic: Jimi Hendrix and Post-War Pop'', [[Brian Eno]] and [[Russell Mills (artist)|Russell Mills]]'s ''[[More Dark Than Shark]]'', and working with [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Prince Charles]] on a volume of his collected speeches. Townshend commissioned [[Dave Rimmer]]'s ''[[Like Punk Never Happened]]'', and was [[commissioning editor]] for radical playwright [[Steven Berkoff]].\n\nTwo years after joining Faber and Faber, Townshend decided to publish a book of his own. ''[[Horse's Neck (book)|Horse's Neck]]'', issued in May 1985, was a collection of short stories he'd written between 1979 and 1984, tackling subjects such as childhood, stardom and spirituality. As a result of his position with Faber and Faber, Townshend developed friendships with both Nobel prize-winning author of ''[[Lord of the Flies]]'', Sir [[William Golding]], and British [[Poet Laureate]] [[Ted Hughes]]. His friendship with Hughes led to Townshend's musical interpretation of Hughes's children's story ''The Iron Man'', six years later, as ''[[The Iron Man: The Musical by Pete Townshend]]'', released in 1989.\n\nTownshend has written several scripts spanning the breadth of his career, including numerous drafts of his elusive ''Lifehouse'' project, the last of which, co-written with radio playwright Jeff Young, was published in 1999. In 1978, Townshend wrote a script for ''Fish Shop'', a play commissioned but not completed by [[London Weekend Television]], and in mid-1984 he wrote a script for ''[[White City: A Novel]]'' which led to a short film.\n\nIn 1989 Townshend began work on a novel entitled ''Ray High & The Glass Household'', a draft of which was later submitted to his editor. While the original novel remains unpublished, elements from this story were used in Townshend's 1993 solo album ''[[Psychoderelict]]''. In 1993, Townshend authored another book, ''[[The Who's Tommy]]'', a chronicle of the development of the award-winning [[Broadway (theatre)|Broadway]] version of his rock opera.\n\nThe opening of his personal website and his commerce site [https://web.archive.org/web/20100830082759/http://www.eelpie.com/ Eelpie.com], both in 2000, gave Townshend another outlet for literary work. Several of Townshend's essays have been posted online, including \"Meher Baba\u2014The Silent Master: My Own Silence\" in 2001, and \"A ''Different'' Bomb\", an indictment of the [[child pornography]] industry, the following year.\n\nIn September 2005, Townshend began posting a novella online entitled ''[[The Boy Who Heard Music]]'' as background for a musical of the same name. He posted a chapter each week until it was completed, and novella was available to read at his website for several months. Like ''Psychoderelict'', it was yet another extrapolation of ''Lifehouse'' and ''Ray High & The Glass Household''.\n\nIn 1997 Townshend signed a deal with [[Little, Brown and Company]] publishing to write his autobiography, reportedly titled ''Pete Townshend: Who He?'' Townshend's creative vagaries and conceptual machinations have been chronicled by Larry David Smith in his book ''The Minstrel's Dilemma'' ([[Praeger Publishers|Praeger]] 1999). After a lengthy delay, Townshend's autobiography, now titled ''[[Who I Am (book)|Who I Am]]'', was released 8 October 2012.<ref>Townshend, Pete. (2012) ''[[Who I Am (book)|Who I Am: A Memoir]]'', New York City: [[Harper Collins Publishers]]. {{ISBN|978-0-06-212724-2}}</ref> The book ranked in the top 5 of the ''[[New York Times]]'' best seller list in October 2012.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/best-sellers-books/2012-10-28/overview.html |title=Best Sellers |work=The New York Times |date=28 October 2012 |accessdate=10 January 2013}}</ref>\n\nOn 5 March 2019, Townshend announced that his debut novel, titled ''The Age of Anxiety'', would be published on 5 November 2019 by [[Hodder & Stoughton]] imprint Coronet.

At about this time, Townshend, who had been searching the past two years for a basis for a rock opera, created a story inspired by the teachings of Baba and other writings and expressing the enlightenment he believed that he had received from them, which ultimately became ''[[Tommy (rock opera)|Tommy]]''.<ref>Barnes, Richard.

The Who were renowned as a very loud band in their live performances; some particular incidents include a Who concert at the [[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton Athletic Football Club]], London, on 31 May 1976 that was listed as the \"Loudest Concert Ever\" by the [[Guinness World Records|Guinness Book of Records]], where the volume level was measured at 126 [[decibel]]s 32 metres from the stage. Townshend has also attributed the start of his hearing loss to Keith Moon's famous exploding drum set during the Who's 1967 appearance on ''[[The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour]]''.<ref>{{cite magazine | last=Grow | first=Kory | date=4 March 2016 | title=Flashback: Watch the Who Blow Up 'Smothers Brothers' in Primetime | magazine=[[Rolling Stone]] | url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/flashback-the-who-blow-up-smothers-brothers-in-primetime-20160304 | access-date=15 August 2016 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1989, Townshend gave the initial funding to allow the formation of the non-profit hearing advocacy group [[H.E.A.R.]] (Hearing Education and Awareness for Rockers). After the Who performed at half-time at [[Super Bowl XLIV]], Townshend stated that he is concerned that his tinnitus has grown to such a point that he might be forced to discontinue performing with the band altogether. He told ''Rolling Stone'', \"If my hearing is going to be a problem, we're not delaying shows. We're ''finished''. I can't really see any way around the issue.\" [[Neil Young]] introduced him to an [[Audiology|audiologist]] who suggested he use an [[in-ear monitor]], and although they cancelled their spring 2010 touring schedule, Townshend used the device at their one remaining London concert on 30 March 2010, to ascertain the feasibility of Townshend continuing to perform with the Who.<ref name=\"Tinnitus RS1\">{{cite web|last=Kreps|first=Daniel|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/rockdaily/index.php/2010/02/18/the-whos-future-uncertain-as-townshends-tinnitus-returns/|title=The Who's Future Uncertain as Townshend's Tinnitus Returns|date=8 February 2010|work=Rolling Stone|accessdate=21 February 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn March 2011, Roger Daltrey said in an interview with the [[BBC]] that Townshend had recently experienced gradual but severe [[hearing loss]] and was now trying to save what remained of his hearing: \"Pete's having terrible trouble with his hearing. He's got really, really bad problems with it...not [[tinnitus]], it's deterioration and he's seriously now worried about actually losing his hearing.\"\n\nReferring to that, in July 2011, Townshend wrote at his blog: \"My hearing is actually better than ever because after a feedback scare at the [[indigO2]] in December 2008 I am taking good care of it. I have computer systems in my studio that have helped me do my engineering work on the forthcoming Quadrophenia release. I have had assistance from younger forensic engineers and mastering engineers to help me clean up the high frequencies that are out of my range. The same computer systems work wonderfully well on stage, proving to be perfect for me when the Who performed at the Super Bowl and doing Quadrophenia for [[Teenage Cancer Trust|TCT]] at the [[Royal Albert Hall]] in 2010. I'm 66, I don't have perfect hearing, and if I listen to loud music or go to gigs I do tend to get tinnitus.\"\n\n===Political views===\nIn 1998, Townshend was named in a list of the biggest private financial donors to the [[Labour Party (UK)|UK Labour Party]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/161057.stm |title='Luvvies' for Labour |work=BBC News |date=30 August 1998 |accessdate=22 May 2010}}</ref> He refused to let [[Michael Moore]] use \"[[Won't Get Fooled Again]]\" in ''[[Fahrenheit 9/11]]'', saying that he watched ''[[Bowling for Columbine]]'' and was not convinced.<ref>{{cite web|last=Rashbaum |first=Alyssa |date=13 July 2004 |title=Pete Townshend Says Don't Be 'Fooled' By Michael Moore |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1489389/20040713/who.jhtml?headlines=true |publisher=MTV |accessdate=8 December 2012}}</ref>\nIn 1961 while in art school, Townshend joined the [[Young Communist League (UK)|Young Communist League]] and was a prominent figure in their 1966 \"Trend\" recruitment campaign.

His first solo concert, for example, was a 1974 benefit show which was organised to raise funds for the Camden Square Community Play Centre.\n\nThe earliest public example of Townshend's involvement with charitable causes was in 1968, when Townshend donated the use of his former Wardour Street apartment to the Meher Baba Association. The following year, the association was moved to another Townshend-owned apartment, the Eccleston Square former residence of his wife Karen. Townshend sat on a committee which oversaw the operation and finances of the centre. \"The committee sees to it that it is open a couple of days a week, and keeps the bills paid and the library full\", he wrote in a 1970 ''Rolling Stone'' article.\n\nIn 1969 and 1972, Townshend produced two limited-release albums, ''Happy Birthday'' and ''I Am'', for the London-based Baba association. This led to 1972's ''Who Came First'', a more widespread release, 15 percent of the revenue of which went to the Baba association. A further limited release, ''With Love'', was released in 1976. A limited-edition boxed set of all three limited releases on CD, ''Avatar'', was released in 2000, with all profits going to the [[Avatar Meher Baba Trust]] in India, which provided funds to a dispensary, school, hospital and pilgrimage centre.\n\nIn July 1976, Townshend opened Meher Baba Oceanic, a London activity centre for Baba followers, which featured film dubbing and editing facilities, a cinema and a recording studio. In addition, the centre served as a regular meeting place for Baba followers. Townshend offered very economical (reportedly \u00a31 per night) lodging for American followers who needed an overnight stay on their pilgrimages to India. Townshend wrote in a 1977 ''Rolling Stone'' article: {{quote|For a few years, I had toyed with the idea of opening a London house dedicated to Meher Baba. In the eight years I had followed him, I had donated only coppers to foundations set up around the world to carry out the Master's wishes and decided it was about time I put myself on the line. The Who had set up a strong charitable trust of its own which appeased, to an extent, the feeling I had that Meher Baba would rather have seen me give to the poor than to the establishment of yet another so-called 'spiritual center'.}} Townshend also embarked on a project dedicated to the collection, restoration and maintenance of Meher Baba-related films. The project was known as MEFA, or Meher Baba European Film Archive.\n\n===Children's charities===\nTownshend has been an active champion of children's charities. The debut of Pete Townshend's stage version of ''[[Tommy (rock opera)|Tommy]]'' took place at San Diego's [[La Jolla Playhouse]] in July 1992. The show was earmarked as a benefit for the London-based [[Nordoff\u2013Robbins music therapy|Nordoff-Robbins]] Music Therapy Foundation, an organisation which helps children with [[autism]] and [[intellectual disability]].\n\nTownshend performed at a 1995 benefit organised by [[Paul Simon]] at [[Madison Square Garden]]'s Paramount Theatre for the [[Children's Health Fund]]. The following year, Townshend performed at a benefit for the annual [[Bridge School Benefit]], a California facility for children with severe speech and physical impairments, with concerts organised by [[Neil Young|Neil]] and [[Pegi Young]]. In 1997, Townshend established a relationship with [[Maryville Academy]], a Chicago area children's charity. Between 1997 and 2002, Townshend played five benefit shows for Maryville Academy, raising at least $1,600,000. His 1998 album ''[[A Benefit for Maryville Academy]]'' was made to support their activities and proceeds from the sales of his release were donated to them.\n\nAs a member of [[the Who]], Townshend has also performed a series of concerts, beginning in 2000 to benefit the [[Teenage Cancer Trust]] in the UK, which raised several million pounds. In 2005, Townshend performed at New York's [[Gotham Hall]] for Samsung's Four Seasons of Hope, an annual children's charity fundraiser. In the same year, he donated a smashed guitar to the Pediatric Epilepsy Project.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.modernguitars.com/archives/001029.html |title=Pete Townshend Smashes Guitar... for Charity |work=Modern Guitars |date=12 August 2005 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051119144842/http://www.modernguitars.com/archives/001029.html |archivedate=19 November 2005}}</ref>\n\nOn 4 November 2011, Roger Daltrey and Pete Townshend launched the Daltrey/Townshend Teen and Young Adult Cancer Program at the [[Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center]] in Los Angeles, to be funded by the Who's charity Who Cares. The launch, followed on 5 November by a fund-raising event, was also attended by [[Robert Plant]] and [[Dave Grohl]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sacbee.com/2011/11/04/4031201/the-who-launch-teen-cancer-program.html|title=The Who launch teen cancer program at LA hospital|work=The Sacramento Bee|date=4 November 2011|accessdate=4 November 2011}}{{Dead link|date=December 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Drug rehabilitation===\nTownshend has also advocated for [[drug rehabilitation]]. In a 1985 radio interview, he said:\n\n{{quote|What I'm most active in doing is raising money to provide beds in clinics to help people that have become victims of drug abuse. In Britain, the facilities are very, very, very lean indeed&nbsp;... although we have a national health service, a free medical system, it does nothing particularly for [[List of controlled drugs in the United Kingdom|class A]] drug addicts \u2013 [[cocaine]] abusers, heroin abusers&nbsp;... we're making a lot of progress&nbsp;... the British government embarked on an anti-heroin campaign with advertising, and I was co-opted by them as a kind of figurehead, and then the various other people co-opted me into their own campaigns, but my main work is raising money to try and open a large clinic.}}\n\nThe \"large clinic\" Townshend was referring to was a plan he and drug rehabilitation experimenter [[Meg Patterson]] had devised to open a drug treatment facility in London; however, the plan failed to come to fruition. Two early 1979 concerts by the Who raised \u00a320,000 for Patterson's Pharmakon Clinic in [[Sussex]].\n\nFurther examples of Townshend's drug rehabilitation activism took place in the form of a 1984 [[benefit concert]] (incidentally the first live performance of Manchester band [[the Stone Roses]]), an article he wrote a few days later for Britain's ''[[Mail on Sunday]]'' urging better care for the nation's growing number of drug addicts, and the formation of a charitable organisation, Double-O Charities, to raise funds for the causes he'd recently championed. Townshend also personally sold fund-raising anti-heroin T-shirts at a series of UK [[Bruce Springsteen]] concerts and reportedly financed a trip for former [[The Clash|Clash]] drummer [[Topper Headon]] to undergo drug rehabilitation treatment. Townshend's 1985\u201386 band, Deep End, played two benefits at [[Brixton Academy]] in 1985 for Double-O Charities.\n\n===Amnesty International===\nIn 1979 Townshend donated his services to the human rights organisation [[Amnesty International]] when he performed three songs for its benefit show ''[[The Secret Policeman's Ball (1979)|The Secret Policeman's Ball]]'' \u2013 performances that were released on record and seen in the film of the show. Townshend's acoustic performances of three of his songs (\"[[Pinball Wizard]]\", \"Drowned\", and \"[[Won't Get Fooled Again]]\") were subsequently cited as forerunners and inspiration for the \"[[Acoustic Music|unplugged]]\" phenomenon in the 1990s.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.secretpolicemansball.com/schedule.200906131930e.html |title=The Secret Policeman's Film Festival |year=2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090618062059/http://www.secretpolicemansball.com/schedule.200906131930e.html |archivedate=18 June 2009}}</ref>\n\nTownshend had been invited to perform for Amnesty by [[Martin Lewis (humorist)|Martin Lewis]], the producer of ''[[The Secret Policeman's Ball (1979)|The Secret Policeman's Ball]]'', who stated later that Townshend's participation had been the key to his securing the subsequent participation for Amnesty (in the 1981 sequel show) of [[Sting (musician)|Sting]], [[Eric Clapton]], [[Jeff Beck]], [[Phil Collins]] and [[Bob Geldof]]. Other performers inspired to support Amnesty International in future ''[[The Secret Policeman's Ball (1979)|Secret Policeman's Ball]]'' shows and other benefits because of Townshend's early commitment to the organisation include [[Peter Gabriel]], [[Bruce Springsteen]], [[David Gilmour]] and [[U2]]'s lead singer [[Bono]] who in 1986 told ''Rolling Stone'' magazine: \"I saw ''The Secret Policeman's Ball'' and it became a part of me.

Pianist Andy Newman (an old art school friend), drummer [[Speedy Keen|John \"Speedy\" Keen]] (who had written \"Armenia City in the Sky\" for the Who to record for their 1967 album ''[[The Who Sell Out]]'') and teenage guitarist [[Jimmy McCulloch]] (later to join [[Wings (band)|Wings]]). Townshend produced the band and played bass on their recordings under the tongue-in-cheek pseudonym \"Bijou Drains\". Their first recording was the single \"[[Something in the Air (song)|Something in the Air]]\", which became a number one hit in the UK and a substantial hit elsewhere in the world. This was the only number one hit in the UK that Townshend performed on. (The Who had none.)<ref name=\"songfacts1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.songfacts.com/detail.php?id=4148 |title=Something in the Air by Thunderclap Newman Songfacts |website=Songfacts.com |accessdate=15 May 2011}}</ref> Following this success, Townshend produced their sole album, ''Hollywood Dream''.\n\nTownshend also produced \"[[Fire (Arthur Brown song)|Fire]]\" by [[the Crazy World of Arthur Brown]] in 1968 that was No. 1 in the UK and No. 2 in the US and was also an executive-producer on the band's debut album, also called ''[[The Crazy World of Arthur Brown (album)|The Crazy World of Arthur Brown]]''.<ref name=\"songfacts1\"/>\n\nIn 1971 Townshend, along with [[Keith Moon]] and [[Ronnie Lane]], backed [[Mike Heron]] (of the [[Incredible String Band]]) on one song \"Warm Heart Pastry\" from Heron's first solo LP, ''[[Smiling Men with Bad Reputations]]''. On the album notes, they are listed as \"Tommy and the Bijoux\". Also present on the track was [[John Cale]] on viola.\n\nIn 1984 Townshend contributed lyrics to the track \"I'm the Answer\" on his brother [[Simon Townshend|Simon]]'s debut solo album ''[[Sweet Sound]]'' which was released as a single and features Townshend and Simon on an interview that wrongly names that the track was by \"Peter Townshend\".\n\nIn 1984 Townshend contributed lyrics to two songs (\"Love on the Air\" and \"All Lovers are Deranged\") on [[David Gilmour]]'s solo album ''[[About Face (album)|About Face]]''.\n\nThrough much of 2005, Pete Townshend recorded and performed alongside his girlfriend [[Rachel Fuller]], a classically trained pianist and singer-songwriter.\n\nIn 2006 Townshend opened a website for implementation of [[The Lifehouse Method]] based on his 1971 ''[[Lifehouse (rock opera)|Lifehouse]]'' concept. This website was in collaboration with composer [[Lawrence Ball]] and software developer David Snowden, with instrumentation by Steve Hills. Applicants at the website could input data to compose a musical \"portrait\" which the musical team could then develop into larger compositions for a planned concert or series of concerts.\n\nOther appearances include:\n* \"[[Because You're Young]]\" with [[David Bowie]] on ''[[Scary Monsters (And Super Creeps)|Scary Monsters]]'' (1980)\n*  Backing vocals on \"[[Slave (The Rolling Stones song)|Slave]]\" with \"[[The Rolling Stones]]\" ''[[Tattoo You]]'' (1981)\n*  Acoustic guitar on \"[[Ball and Chain (Elton John song)|Ball and Chain]]\" with [[Elton John]] on ''[[Jump Up!

He oversaw SS construction projects and towards the end of [[World War II]] was put in charge of the [[V-2 rocket|V-2 missile]] and jet programmes.\n\n==Early life==\nKammler was born in [[Szczecin|Stettin]], [[German Empire]] (now [[Szczecin]], [[Poland]]). In 1919, after volunteering for army service, he served in the [[Gerhard Ro\u00dfbach|Rossbach]] [[Freikorps]]. From 1919 to 1923, he studied [[civil engineering]] at the [[Gda\u0144sk University of Technology|Technische Hochschule der Freien Stadt Danzig]] and Munich and was awarded his Dr.-Ing. in November 1932, following some years of practical work in local building administration.{{sfn|Tooze|2007|p=209}}\n\nKammler joined the [[Nazi Party]] (NSDAP) in 1931{{sfn|Karlsch|2014|p=52}} and held a variety of administrative positions after the [[Nazism|Nazi]] government came to power in 1933, initially as head of the Aviation Ministry's building department. He joined the SS (no. 113,619) on 20 May 1933. In 1934, he was a councillor for the Reich's Interior Ministry.\n\nIn 1934, he also was the leader of the ''Reichsbund der Kleing\u00e4rtner und Kleinsiedler'' (Reich's federation of small gardeners and landowners).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lsk-kleingarten.de/uploads/media/LSK_Kapitel_3.pdf|title=Blut- und Bodenideologie \u2013 die Landesgruppe Sachsen im Reichsbund der Kleing\u00e4rtner und Kleinsiedler Deutschlands (1933\u20131945) (German)}}{{Dead link|date=January 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n==World War II==\nIn June 1941, Kammler joined the Waffen-SS.{{sfn|Karlsch|2014|p=52}}\n\nKammler eventually became [[Oswald Pohl]]'s deputy at the [[SS Main Economic and Administrative Office]] (WVHA). He oversaw Office D (administration of the [[concentration camp]] system), and was also Chief of Office C, which designed and constructed all the concentration and [[extermination camps]]. In this latter capacity he oversaw the installation of more efficient cremation facilities at [[Auschwitz-Birkenau]] as part of the camp's conversion to an extermination camp.{{sfn|van Pelt|2002|p=209}}{{sfn|Post|2004}}\n\n===Role on advanced weapon projects===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 141-1880, Peenem\u00fcnde, Start einer V2.jpg|thumb|upright|A [[V-2]] launched from a fixed site in summer 1943]]\n[[File:Mimoyecques-Eperlecques-Wizernes map.png|left|thumb|Map of the [[Pas-de-Calais]] and south-eastern England showing the location of [[Blockhaus d'\u00c9perlecques|\u00c9perlecques]] and other major V-weapons sites]]\nThere is no indication of Kammler being involved in any advanced engineering projects prior to the beginning of World War II, apart from his educational background, nor is there any suggestion of his involvement in any weapons projects in the early years.\n\nClear links between Kammler and advanced weapon projects seem to appear only in 1942. Early evidence of this is a letter from Oswald Pohl to [[Heinrich Himmler]] referring an interdepartmental memorandum on the manufacturing of modern weapons in concentration camps, having Kammler as one of the participants.\n\nKammler was also charged with constructing facilities for various secret weapons projects, including manufacturing plants and test stands for the [[Messerschmitt Me 262]] and [[V-2]]. Following the Allied bombing raids on [[Peenem\u00fcnde]] in [[Bombing of Peenem\u00fcnde in World War II|Operation ''Hydra'']], in August 1943, Kammler assumed responsibility for the construction of mass-production facilities for the V-2.{{sfn|Karlsch|2014|p=52}} He started moving these production facilities underground, which resulted in the [[Mittelwerk]] facility and its attendant concentration camp complex, [[Mittelbau-Dora]], which housed [[slave labour]] for constructing the factory and working on the production lines. The project was pushed ahead under enormous time pressures despite the consequences for the slave laborers employed on it. Kammler's motto at the time was reportedly, \"Don't worry about the victims. The work must proceed ahead in the shortest time possible\".{{sfn|Bornemann|Broszat|1970|p=165}}\n\nDuring this period, Kammler also was involved in the attempt to finish the [[Blockhaus d'\u00c9perlecques]] known also as the Watten Bunker, a rather unsuccessful project to create a fortified V-2 launch base.\n\n[[Albert Speer]] made Kammler his representative for ''\"special construction tasks\"'', expecting that Kammler would commit himself to working in harmony with the ministry's main construction committee. But in March 1944 Kammler had [[Hermann G\u00f6ring|G\u00f6ring]] appoint him as his delegate for ''\"special buildings\"'' under the fighter aircraft programme, which made him one of the war economy's most important managers, and robbed Speer of much of his influence.{{sfn|Kroener|2003|p=390}}\n\n===Commanding V-2 attacks===\n\nAt the start of the V-2 bombing campaign, Kammler received a senior position on the command and control of operations. There are several contradictory testimonies on how far and how deep he commanded the bombardments of London and Antwerp but, at least, it is well known he played an active role on the deployment and maintenance of the units involved in the operations, frequently through general [[Walter Dornberger]]. A quite symbolic fact of his involvement may be that, at the end of the campaign, the orders to reorganize the V2 units into regular infantry came from Kammler directly.{{sfn|Dungan}} Many sources accept this moment, probably due to the role of some of the V2 units in the Arnsberg Forest massacre and subsequent investigations.\n\n===The Arnsberg Forest Massacre===\n{{main|:de:Massaker_im_Arnsberger_Wald|l1 = Arnsberg Forest Massacre (in German)}}\n\nIn late March 1945 Kammler was responsible for ordering the ZV division to execute more than 200 men, women and children (forced labourers and their families) after his car was held up on a crowded road in the Sauerland. Kammler felt Germans were under some \"vague threat\". \"This riffraff ought to be eliminated\" was his reported comment [[The German War|(The German War \u2013 N Stargardt \u2013 p517)]].\n\nThe Arnsberg Massacre coincided with the evacuation of the V2 units due to Allied advance. According to court trials, in 1958, Kammler was not present during the massacre but most testimonies pointed to his statements, justifying the orders for the massacre. It was during this trial that some new stories of his suicide/death surfaced and became the main versions of his demise leading to a quite controversial verdict.\n\nAfter the massacre the ZV division destroyed most of its equipment and was formally reorganized as an infantry unit. Some sources claim that, after this, Kammler relinquished command and the unit was in fact left to fend for itself during the final days of the war.\n\nThe Arnsberg Massacre is considered one of the most shocking mass murders in the final days of the war. While small in the number of victims, it was quite peculiar in its savagery, chaos and people involved (ex. soldiers from an elite high-tech V2 unit and two children as victims).\n\nThe massacre has been matter of a large studies.{{sfn|Meillan|2019}}{{sfn|Dvorksy|2019}}\n\n===Final years===\n\nAfter the Reich's failure to attain a victory against USSR, Kammler started to answer for an ever-growing number of projects, most of them related to construction and engineering. Concentration camps, means of mass extermination, factories, labor management, underground facilities of various purposes, and tank construction were some of the hallmarks of his early years in the SS hierarchy. As far as it is known, he also directly supervised several project bureaus and had direct contact with some of the best engineers of the Reich (e.g. [[Ferdinand Porsche]]). As a person, he was characterized by one of his subordinates as intelligent, a pure workaholic, completely given to his work, with a fanatic rhythm and demanding the same from everyone else.\n\nIn 1944, Himmler convinced [[Adolf Hitler]] to put the [[V-2 rocket|V-2]] project directly under [[SS]] control, and on 8 August Kammler replaced [[Walter Dornberger]] as its director. From 31 January 1945, Kammler was head of all missile projects.{{sfn|Karlsch|2014|p=52}} During this time he also partially answerable for the operational use of the V-2 against the Allies, until the moment the war front reached Germany's borders.  As an SS officer, Kammler was the last person in Nazi Germany to be appointed to the rank of ''SS-[[Obergruppenf\u00fchrer]]''.<ref name=\"SS 1945\">''Dienstalterslisten der SS'', NSDAP Revised edition (20 April 1945)</ref>\n\nIn March 1945, partially under the advice of Goebbels, Hitler gradually stripped Goering of several powers on aircraft support as well as maintenance and supply while transferring them to Kammler. This culminated, in the beginning of April, with Kammler being raised to \"Fuehrer's general plenipotentiary for jet aircraft\".{{sfn|Kroener|2003|p=390}}\n\nOn 1 April 1945, Kammler ordered the evacuation of 500 missile technicians to the Alps. Since the last V-2 on the western front had been launched in late March, on 5 April Kammler was charged by the ''Oberkommando der Wehrmacht'' to command the defence of the Nordhausen area. However, rather than defend the missile construction works, he immediately ordered the destruction of all the \"special V-1 equipment\" at the [[Syke]] storage site. What exactly this order implied is unclear.{{sfn|Karlsch|2014|p=52}}\n\n==Death==\n===Preuk statement===\nOn 9 July 1945, Kammler's wife petitioned to have him declared dead as of 9 May 1945. She provided a statement by Kammler's driver, Kurt Preuk, according to which Preuk had personally seen \"the corpse of Kammler and been present at his burial\" on 9 May 1945. The District Court of [[Berlin-Charlottenburg]] ruled on 7 September 1948 that his death was officially established as 9 May 1945.{{sfn|Karlsch|2014|p=52}}\n\nIn a later sworn statement on 16 October 1959, Preuk stated that Kammler's date of death was ''\"about 10 May 1945\"'', but that he did not know the cause of death. On 7 September 1965, Heinz Zeuner (a wartime aide of Kammler's), stated that Kammler had died on 7 May 1945 and that his corpse had been observed by Zeuner, Preuk and others. All the eyewitnesses consulted were certain that the cause of death was [[cyanide]] poisoning.{{sfn|Naasner|1998|p=341}} In their accounts of Kammler's movements Preuk and Zeuner claimed that he left [[Linderhof Palace|Linderhof]] near [[Oberammergau]] on 28 April 1945 for a tank conference at [[Salzburg]] and then went to [[Ebensee]] (where tank tracks were manufactured). According to Preuk and Zeuner he then travelled back from Ebensee to visit his wife in the [[Tyrol (state)|Tyrol]] region, when he gave her two [[cyanide]] tablets. The next day, 5 May, at around 4 am, he is said to have departed Tyrol for [[Prague]].{{sfn|Karlsch|2014|p=52}}\n\n[[Wernher von Braun]], also at the time at Oberammergau, later reported having overheard a discussion between Kammler and his aide-de-camp in which Kammler said he planned to hide in nearby [[Ettal Abbey]]. Kammler and his followers then left town, according to Braun.{{sfn|Karlsch|2014|p=52}} Further evidence of Kammler's activities is a telegraph from Kammler to Speer, Himmler and G\u00f6ring of 16 April, informing them of the creation of a \"message centre\" at Munich and the appointment of a chief representative for the construction of the [[Messerschmitt Me 262]]. On 20 April, he reportedly arrived with a group of technicians at Himmler\u2019s ''Kommandostelle'' near Salzburg. On 23 April, Kammler sent a radio message to his office manager at Berlin, ordering him to organize the immediate destruction of the \"V-1 equipment near Berlin\" and then to go to Munich.{{sfn|Karlsch|2014|p=52}} In late April/early May, Kammler was reportedly at the ''Villa Mendelssohn'' at Ebensee, site of one of the projects assigned to him. On 4 May, he ordered the immediate transfer of the Ebensee office to Prague.{{sfn|Karlsch|2014|p=52}}\n\nPreuk and Zeuner maintained their version of events through the 1990s, when interviewed by the journalist Kristian Knaack. Some support for this version of events came from letters written by Ingeborg Alix Prinzessin zu Schaumburg-Lippe, a female member of the ''SS-Helferinnenkorps'' to Kammler\u2019s wife in 1951 and 1955. In these, she affirmed that Kammler had said goodbye to her on 7 May 1945 in Prague, stating that the Americans were after him, had made him offers but that he had refused and that they would not \"get him alive\".{{sfn|Karlsch|2014|p=52}}\n\n===Prague===\nAuthor Bernd Ruland, in his 1969 book ''Wernher von Braun: Mein Leben f\u00fcr die Raumfahrt'', reports an altogether different account of Kammler's death. According to Ruland, Kammler arrived in Prague by aircraft on 4 May 1945, following which he and 21 SS men defended a bunker against an attack by more than 500 Czech resistance fighters on 9 May. During the attack, Kammler's aide-de-camp Sturmbannf\u00fchrer Starck shot Kammler to prevent him from falling into enemy hands.{{sfn|Ruland|1969|p=292}} This version can reportedly be traced to [[Walter Dornberger]], who in turn is said to have heard it from eyewitnesses.{{sfn|Piszkiewicz|2007|p=215}}\n\n===Post-war search for Kammler===\n\nUS occupation forces conducted various inquiries into Kammler\u2019s whereabouts, beginning with the headquarters of 12th Army ordering a complete inventory of all personnel involved in missile production on 21 May 1945. This resulted in the creation of a file for Kammler, stating that he was possibly in Munich. The [[Counterintelligence Corps (United States Army)|CIC]] noted that he had been seen shortly prior to the arrival of US troops in [[Oberjoch]].{{sfn|Karlsch|2014|p=53}}\n\nThe Combined Intelligence Objectives Sub-Committee (CIOS) in London ordered a search for him in early July 1945. 12th Army replied that he was last seen on 8 or 9 April in the [[Harz]] region. In August, Kammler's name made \"List 13\" of the UN for Nazi war criminals. Only in 1948 did the CIOS receive the information that Kammler reportedly fled to Prague and had committed suicide. Original blueprints of Kammler\u2019s major projects were later found in the personal property of [[Samuel Goudsmit]], the scientific leader of the [[Alsos Mission]].{{sfn|Karlsch|2014|p=53}}\n\nIn 1949 a report written by one Oskar Packe on Kammler was filed by the US Denazification office in [[Hesse]]. The report stated that Kammler had been arrested by US troops on 9 May 1945 at the [[Messerschmitt]] works at Oberammergau. However, Kammler and some other senior SS personnel had managed to escape in the direction of Austria or Italy. Packe disbelieved the reports about a suicide, as these were \"refuted by the detailed information from the CIC\" about arrest and escape.{{sfn|Karlsch|2014|p=53}}\n\nA CIC report from April 1946 listed Kammler among SS officers known to be outside Germany and considered to be of special interest to the CIC.\nIn mid-July 1945, the head of the [[Gmunden]] CIC office, Major Morrisson interviewed an unnamed German on the issue of a numbered account associated with construction sites for plane and missile production formerly run by the SS. A report published years later, in late 1947 or early 1948, stated that only Kammler and two other persons had access to the account.

According to them, Richardson claimed to have supervised Kammler until 1947. Kammler was supposedly \"interned at a place of maximum security, with no hope, no mercy and without seeing the light of day until he hanged himself\".{{sfn|Karlsch|2014|p=53}}\n\n===Possible last documented independent testimonies===\nA purported section of a wartime diary, relating to the surrender of the mountain resort town [[Garmisch-Partenkirchen]] to Allied troops, mentions Kammler and his staff.{{sfn|Gais|1945}} According to this account, Kammler and what the author refers to as his staff of some 600 people, with \"good quality\" cars and trucks arrived in [[Oberammergau]] (north of Garmisch-Partenkirchen) on 22 April 1945. This arrival had been badly received and the local authorities had several arguments with Kammler himself. These conflicts are mentioned in the entries for 23 and 25 April. The last reference, implicating only Kammler's \"staff\", comes on the night of 28 April \u2013 an Oberleutnant Burger reports that they had gone on the same night that American forces began storming Oberammergau, forcing their way into Garmisch and Austria.{{sfn|Utschneider|2000}}\n\n=== Biography ===\nOn 8 October 2019, an American lawyer, Dean Reuter, along with co-authors Colm Lowery and Keith Chester, published \"The Hidden Nazi: The Untold Story of America's Deal with the Devil,\" a first-person account of the author's attempt to discover unreported aspects of Kammler's life, including his involvement in Cold War geopolitics, and to verify that Kammler committed suicide in 1945.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Hidden-Nazi-Untold-Story-Americas/dp/162157735X/|title=The Hidden Nazi: The Untold Story of America's Deal with the Devil|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Arthur Rudolph]]\n*[[Jakob Sporrenberg]]\n*[[Register of SS-Leaders in general\u2019s rank#List SS-Obergruppenf\u00fchrer|List SS-Obergruppenf\u00fchrer]]\n*[[Wernher von Braun]]\n*[[Walter Dornberger]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n* {{cite book | last = Agoston | first = Tom | title = Blunder!: How the U.S. Gave Away Nazi Supersecrets to Russia | publisher = Dodd, Mead | year = 1985 | isbn = 0-396-08556-3 | ref = harv}}\n* {{cite journal | last1 = Bornemann | first1 = Manfred | last2 = Broszat | first2 = Martin | title = Das KL Dora-Mittelbau | journal = Studien zur Geschichte der Konzentrationslager | language = German | volume = 21 | pages = 154\u2013198 | location = Stuttgart | year = 1970 | doi = 10.1524/9783486703627.154 | series = Schriftenreihe der Vierteljahrshefte f\u00fcr Zeitgeschichte | isbn = 978-3-486-70362-7 | ref = harv}}\n* {{cite book | last = Farrell  | first = Joseph P. | title = Reich of the Black Sun: Nazi Secret Weapons & the Cold War Allied Legend | publisher = Adventures Unlimited Press | year = 2005 | isbn = 1-931882-39-8 | ref = harv}}\n* {{cite web | last = Dungan | first = T | title = A4/V2 Launch Sites in Westerwald, Germany | url = http://www.v2rocket.com/start/deployment/westerwald.html | accessdate = 16 October 2019 | ref = harv}}\n* {{cite web | last = Meillan | first = Solly | title = 400 Artifacts Unearthed at Site of Nazi Massacre Targeting Polish, Soviet P.O.W.s | url = https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/400-artifacts-unearthed-site-nazi-massacre-targeting-polish-soviet-pows-180971711/ | accessdate = 16 October 2019 | ref = harv}}\n* {{cite web | last = Dvorsky | first = Georg | title = Hundreds of Artifacts from Notorious Nazi Massacre Uncovered in German Forest | url = https://gizmodo.com/hundreds-of-artifacts-from-notorious-nazi-massacre-unco-1833240056 | accessdate = 16 October 2019 | ref = harv}}\n* {{cite web | last = Gais | first = Huber | title = Ein Kriegsende \u2013 Garmisch-Partenkirchen in den letzten Apriltagen 1945 | date = 15 May 1945 | url = http://members.gaponline.de/alois.schwarzmueller/ns_zeit_1945_kriegsende_quellen/05_hubert_gais.htm | accessdate = 30 October 2013 | ref = harv | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20131101152532/http://members.gaponline.de/alois.schwarzmueller/ns_zeit_1945_kriegsende_quellen/05_hubert_gais.htm | archive-date = 1 November 2013 | url-status = dead }}\n* {{Cite journal | last = Karlsch | first = Rainer | title = Was wurde aus Hans Kammler?

He oversaw SS construction projects and towards the end of [[World War II]] was put in charge of the [[V-2 rocket|V-2 missile]] and jet programmes.  \n\n==Early life==\nKammler was born in [[Szczecin|Stettin]], [[German Empire]] (now [[Szczecin]], [[Poland]]). In 1919, after volunteering for army service, he served in the [[Gerhard Ro\u00dfbach|Rossbach]] [[Freikorps]]. From 1919 to 1923, he studied [[civil engineering]] at the [[Gda\u0144sk University of Technology|Technische Hochschule der Freien Stadt Danzig]] and Munich and was awarded his Dr.-Ing. in November 1932, following some years of practical work in local building administration.{{sfn|Tooze|2007|p=209}}\n\nKammler joined the [[Nazi Party]] (NSDAP) in 1931{{sfn|Karlsch|2014|p=52}} and held a variety of administrative positions after the [[Nazism|Nazi]] government came to power in 1933, initially as head of the Aviation Ministry's building department. He joined the SS (no. 113,619) on 20 May 1933. In 1934, he was a councillor for the Reich's Interior Ministry.\n\nIn 1934, he also was the leader of the ''Reichsbund der Kleing\u00e4rtner und Kleinsiedler'' (Reich's federation of small gardeners and landowners).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lsk-kleingarten.de/uploads/media/LSK_Kapitel_3.pdf|title=Blut- und Bodenideologie \u2013 die Landesgruppe Sachsen im Reichsbund der Kleing\u00e4rtner und Kleinsiedler Deutschlands (1933\u20131945) (German)}}{{Dead link|date=January 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n==World War II==\nIn June 1941, Kammler joined the Waffen-SS.{{sfn|Karlsch|2014|p=52}}\n\nKammler eventually became [[Oswald Pohl]]'s deputy at the [[SS Main Economic and Administrative Office]] (WVHA). He oversaw Office D (administration of the [[concentration camp]] system), and was also Chief of Office C, which designed and constructed all the concentration and [[extermination camps]]. In this latter capacity he oversaw the installation of more efficient cremation facilities at [[Auschwitz-Birkenau]] as part of the camp's conversion to an extermination camp.{{sfn|van Pelt|2002|p=209}}{{sfn|Post|2004}}\n\n===Role on advanced weapon projects===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 141-1880, Peenem\u00fcnde, Start einer V2.jpg|thumb|upright|A [[V-2]] launched from a fixed site in summer 1943]]\n[[File:Mimoyecques-Eperlecques-Wizernes map.png|left|thumb|Map of the [[Pas-de-Calais]] and south-eastern England showing the location of [[Blockhaus d'\u00c9perlecques|\u00c9perlecques]] and other major V-weapons sites]]\nThere is no indication of Kammler being involved in any advanced engineering projects prior to the beginning of World War II, apart from his educational background, nor is there any suggestion of his involvement in any weapons projects in the early years.\n\nClear links between Kammler and advanced weapon projects seem to appear only in 1942. Early evidence of this is a letter from Oswald Pohl to [[Heinrich Himmler]] referring an interdepartmental memorandum on the manufacturing of modern weapons in concentration camps, having Kammler as one of the participants.\n\nKammler was also charged with constructing facilities for various secret weapons projects, including manufacturing plants and test stands for the [[Messerschmitt Me 262]] and [[V-2]]. Following the Allied bombing raids on [[Peenem\u00fcnde]] in [[Bombing of Peenem\u00fcnde in World War II|Operation ''Hydra'']], in August 1943, Kammler assumed responsibility for the construction of mass-production facilities for the V-2.{{sfn|Karlsch|2014|p=52}} He started moving these production facilities underground, which resulted in the [[Mittelwerk]] facility and its attendant concentration camp complex, [[Mittelbau-Dora]], which housed [[slave labour]] for constructing the factory and working on the production lines. The project was pushed ahead under enormous time pressures despite the consequences for the slave laborers employed on it. Kammler's motto at the time was reportedly, \"Don't worry about the victims. The work must proceed ahead in the shortest time possible\".{{sfn|Bornemann|Broszat|1970|p=165}}\n\nDuring this period, Kammler also was involved in the attempt to finish the [[Blockhaus d'\u00c9perlecques]] known also as the Watten Bunker, a rather unsuccessful project to create a fortified V-2 launch base.\n\n[[Albert Speer]] made Kammler his representative for ''\"special construction tasks\"'', expecting that Kammler would commit himself to working in harmony with the ministry's main construction committee. But in March 1944 Kammler had [[Hermann G\u00f6ring|G\u00f6ring]] appoint him as his delegate for ''\"special buildings\"'' under the fighter aircraft programme, which made him one of the war economy's most important managers, and robbed Speer of much of his influence.{{sfn|Kroener|2003|p=390}}\n\n===Commanding V-2 attacks===\n\nAt the start of the V-2 bombing campaign, Kammler received a senior position on the command and control of operations. There are several contradictory testimonies on how far and how deep he commanded the bombardments of London and Antwerp but, at least, it is well known he played an active role on the deployment and maintenance of the units involved in the operations, frequently through general [[Walter Dornberger]]. A quite symbolic fact of his involvement may be that, at the end of the campaign, the orders to reorganize the V2 units into regular infantry came from Kammler directly.{{sfn|Dungan}} Many sources accept this moment, probably due to the role of some of the V2 units in the Arnsberg Forest massacre and subsequent investigations.\n\n===The Arnsberg Forest Massacre===\n{{main|:de:Massaker_im_Arnsberger_Wald|l1 = Arnsberg Forest Massacre (in German)}}\n\nIn late March 1945 Kammler was responsible for ordering the ZV division to execute more than 200 men, women and children (forced labourers and their families) after his car was held up on a crowded road in the Sauerland. Kammler felt Germans were under some \"vague threat\". \"This riffraff ought to be eliminated\" was his reported comment [[The_German_War|(The German War - N Stargardt - p517)]]. \n\nThe Arnsberg Massacre coincided with the evacuation of the V2 units due to Allied advance. According to court trials, in 1958, Kammler was not present during the massacre but most testimonies pointed to his statements, justifying the orders for the massacre. It was during this trial that some new stories of his suicide/death surfaced and became the main versions of his demise leading to a quite controversial verdict.\n\nAfter the massacre the ZV division destroyed most of its equipment and was formally reorganized as an infantry unit. Some sources claim that, after this, Kammler relinquished command and the unit was in fact left to fend for itself during the final days of the war.\n\nThe Arnsberg Massacre is considered one of the most shocking mass murders in the final days of the war. While small in the number of victims, it was quite peculiar in its savagery, chaos and people involved (ex. soldiers from an elite high-tech V2 unit and two children as victims).\n\nThe massacre has been matter of a large studies.{{sfn|Meillan|2019}}{{sfn|Dvorksy|2019}}\n\n===Final years===\n\nAfter the Reich's failure to attain a victory against USSR, Kammler started to answer for an ever-growing number of projects, most of them related to construction and engineering. Concentration camps, means of mass extermination, factories, labor management, underground facilities of various purposes, and tank construction were some of the hallmarks of his early years in the SS hierarchy. As far as it is known, he also directly supervised several project bureaus and had direct contact with some of the best engineers of the Reich (e.g. [[Ferdinand Porsche]]). As a person, he was characterized by one of his subordinates as intelligent, a pure workaholic, completely given to his work, with a fanatic rhythm and demanding the same from everyone else.\n\nIn 1944, Himmler convinced [[Adolf Hitler]] to put the [[V-2 rocket|V-2]] project directly under [[SS]] control, and on 8 August Kammler replaced [[Walter Dornberger]] as its director. From 31 January 1945, Kammler was head of all missile projects.{{sfn|Karlsch|2014|p=52}} During this time he also partially answerable for the operational use of the V-2 against the Allies, until the moment the war front reached Germany's borders.  As an SS officer, Kammler was the last person in Nazi Germany to be appointed to the rank of ''SS-[[Obergruppenf\u00fchrer]]''.<ref name=\"SS 1945\">''Dienstalterslisten der SS'', NSDAP Revised edition (20 April 1945)</ref> \n\nIn March 1945, partially under the advice of Goebbels, Hitler gradually stripped Goering of several powers on aircraft support as well as maintenance and supply while transferring them to Kammler. This culminated, in the beginning of April, with Kammler being raised to \"Fuehrer's general plenipotentiary for jet aircraft\".{{sfn|Kroener|2003|p=390}}<br>  \n\nOn 1 April 1945, Kammler ordered the evacuation of 500 missile technicians to the Alps. Since the last V-2 on the western front had been launched in late March, on 5 April Kammler was charged by the ''Oberkommando der Wehrmacht'' to command the defence of the Nordhausen area. However, rather than defend the missile construction works, he immediately ordered the destruction of all the \"special V-1 equipment\" at the [[Syke]] storage site. What exactly this order implied is unclear.{{sfn|Karlsch|2014|p=52}}\n\n==Death==\n===Preuk statement===\nOn 9 July 1945, Kammler's wife petitioned to have him declared dead as of 9 May 1945. She provided a statement by Kammler's driver, Kurt Preuk, according to which Preuk had personally seen \"the corpse of Kammler and been present at his burial\" on 9 May 1945. The District Court of [[Berlin-Charlottenburg]] ruled on 7 September 1948 that his death was officially established as 9 May 1945.{{sfn|Karlsch|2014|p=52}}\n\nIn a later sworn statement on 16 October 1959, Preuk stated that Kammler's date of death was ''\"about 10 May 1945\"'', but that he did not know the cause of death. On 7 September 1965, Heinz Zeuner (a wartime aide of Kammler's), stated that Kammler had died on 7 May 1945 and that his corpse had been observed by Zeuner, Preuk and others. All the eyewitnesses consulted were certain that the cause of death was [[cyanide]] poisoning.{{sfn|Naasner|1998|p=341}} In their accounts of Kammler's movements Preuk and Zeuner claimed that he left [[Linderhof Palace|Linderhof]] near [[Oberammergau]] on 28 April 1945 for a tank conference at [[Salzburg]] and then went to [[Ebensee]] (where tank tracks were manufactured). According to Preuk and Zeuner he then travelled back from Ebensee to visit his wife in the [[Tyrol (state)|Tyrol]] region, when he gave her two [[cyanide]] tablets. The next day, 5 May, at around 4 am, he is said to have departed Tyrol for [[Prague]].{{sfn|Karlsch|2014|p=52}}\n\n[[Wernher von Braun]], also at the time at Oberammergau, later reported having overheard a discussion between Kammler and his aide-de-camp in which Kammler said he planned to hide in nearby [[Ettal Abbey]]. Kammler and his followers then left town, according to Braun.{{sfn|Karlsch|2014|p=52}} Further evidence of Kammler's activities is a telegraph from Kammler to Speer, Himmler and G\u00f6ring of 16 April, informing them of the creation of a \"message centre\" at Munich and the appointment of a chief representative for the construction of the [[Messerschmitt Me 262]]. On 20 April, he reportedly arrived with a group of technicians at Himmler\u2019s ''Kommandostelle'' near Salzburg. On 23 April, Kammler sent a radio message to his office manager at Berlin, ordering him to organize the immediate destruction of the \"V-1 equipment near Berlin\" and then to go to Munich.{{sfn|Karlsch|2014|p=52}} In late April/early May, Kammler was reportedly at the ''Villa Mendelssohn'' at Ebensee, site of one of the projects assigned to him. On 4 May, he ordered the immediate transfer of the Ebensee office to Prague.{{sfn|Karlsch|2014|p=52}}\n\nPreuk and Zeuner maintained their version of events through the 1990s, when interviewed by the journalist Kristian Knaack. Some support for this version of events came from letters written by Ingeborg Alix Prinzessin zu Schaumburg-Lippe, a female member of the ''SS-Helferinnenkorps'' to Kammler\u2019s wife in 1951 and 1955. In these, she affirmed that Kammler had said goodbye to her on 7 May 1945 in Prague, stating that the Americans were after him, had made him offers but that he had refused and that they would not \"get him alive\".{{sfn|Karlsch|2014|p=52}}\n\n===Prague===\nAuthor Bernd Ruland, in his 1969 book ''Wernher von Braun: Mein Leben f\u00fcr die Raumfahrt'', reports an altogether different account of Kammler's death. According to Ruland, Kammler arrived in Prague by aircraft on 4 May 1945, following which he and 21 SS men defended a bunker against an attack by more than 500 Czech resistance fighters on 9 May. During the attack, Kammler's aide-de-camp Sturmbannf\u00fchrer Starck shot Kammler to prevent him from falling into enemy hands.{{sfn|Ruland|1969|p=292}} This version can reportedly be traced to [[Walter Dornberger]], who in turn is said to have heard it from eyewitnesses.{{sfn|Piszkiewicz|2007|p=215}}\n\n===Post-war search for Kammler===\n\nUS occupation forces conducted various inquiries into Kammler\u2019s whereabouts, beginning with  the headquarters of 12th Army ordering a complete inventory of all personnel involved in missile production on 21 May 1945. This resulted in the creation of a file for Kammler, stating that he was possibly in Munich. The [[Counterintelligence Corps (United States Army)|CIC]] noted that he had been seen shortly prior to the arrival of US troops in [[Oberjoch]].{{sfn|Karlsch|2014|p=53}}\n\nThe Combined Intelligence Objectives Sub-Committee (CIOS) in London ordered a search for him in early July 1945. 12th Army replied that he was last seen on 8 or 9 April in the [[Harz]] region. In August, Kammler's name made \"List 13\" of the UN for Nazi war criminals. Only in 1948 did the CIOS receive the information that Kammler reportedly fled to Prague and had committed suicide. Original blueprints of Kammler\u2019s major projects were later found in the personal property of [[Samuel Goudsmit]], the scientific leader of the [[Alsos Mission]].{{sfn|Karlsch|2014|p=53}}\n\nIn 1949 a report written by one Oskar Packe on Kammler was filed by the US Denazification office in [[Hesse]]. The report stated that Kammler had been arrested by US troops on 9 May 1945 at the [[Messerschmitt]] works at Oberammergau. However, Kammler and some other senior SS personnel had managed to escape in the direction of Austria or Italy. Packe disbelieved the reports about a suicide, as these were \"refuted by the detailed information from the CIC\" about arrest and escape.{{sfn|Karlsch|2014|p=53}}\n\nA CIC report from April 1946 listed Kammler among SS officers known to be outside Germany and considered to be of special interest to the CIC.\nIn mid-July 1945, the head of the [[Gmunden]] CIC office, Major Morrisson interviewed an unnamed German on the issue of a numbered account associated with construction sites for plane and missile production formerly run by the SS. A report published years later, in late 1947 or early 1948, stated that only Kammler and two other persons had access to the account. The report also said that \"shortly after the occupation, Hans Kammler appeared at CIC Gmunden and gave a statement on operations at Ebensee\".<ref name=\"La Repubblica\">{{cite web|title=La fuga segreta del custode dell'atomica nazista - la Repubblica.it|url=http://ricerca.repubblica.it/repubblica/archivio/repubblica/2014/04/25/la-fuga-segreta-del-custode-dellatomica-nazista34.html|work=La Repubblica|language=Italian|accessdate=15 November 2014}}</ref> The CIC notes on the interview give no name, but the interviewee must have been one of the three people with access to the account. Aside from Kammler, one was known to have left Austria in May 1945, the other was in a POW camp during July.{{sfn|Karlsch|2014|p=53}}\n\nFinally, Donald W.

This arrival had been badly received and the local authorities had several arguments with Kammler himself. These conflicts are mentioned in the entries for 23 and 25 April.

It is the eighth film in the [[DC Extended Universe]] and a follow-up to ''[[Suicide Squad (film)|Suicide Squad]]'' (2016). It was directed by [[Cathy Yan]] and written by [[Christina Hodson]], and it stars [[Margot Robbie]], [[Mary Elizabeth Winstead]], [[Jurnee Smollett-Bell]], [[Rosie Perez]], [[Chris Messina]], [[Ella Jay Basco]], [[Ali Wong]], and [[Ewan McGregor]]. The film follows [[Harley Quinn]] as she joins forces with [[Huntress (Helena Bertinelli)|Helena Bertinelli]], [[Dinah Lance]], and [[Renee Montoya]] to save [[Cassandra Cain]] from [[Gotham City]] crime lord [[Black Mask (character)|Black Mask]].\n\nRobbie, who also served as producer, pitched the idea for ''Birds of Prey'' to [[Warner Bros.]] in 2015. The film was announced in May 2016, with Hodson being hired to write the script that November, followed by Yan signing on to direct in April 2018. The majority of the cast and crew were confirmed by December 2018. [[Principal photography]] lasted from January to April 2019 in [[Downtown Los Angeles]], parts of the [[Arts District, Los Angeles]], and soundstages at [[Warner Bros. Studios, Burbank|Warner Bros.

She is taken in by Doc, the elderly owner of a Taiwanese restaurant, and recovers from her relationship by cutting her hair, adopting a [[spotted hyena]] (whom she names after [[Batman|Bruce Wayne]]), and taking up [[roller derby]].\n\nOne night, Harley gets drunk at a [[Clubbing (subculture)|nightclub]] owned by gangster [[Black Mask (character)|Roman Sionis]], and cripples Roman's driver after he insults her. She then meets burlesque singer [[Black Canary|Dinah Lance]], who later rescues an intoxicated Harley from an attempted abduction. Spotting the scuffle from his bedroom, Roman is impressed by Dinah's skills and appoints her as his new driver. The next night, Harley blows up the Ace Chemicals plant where she pledged herself to the Joker years prior as a way to publicly announce their breakup. Meanwhile, [[Gotham City Police Department|GCPD]] Detective [[Renee Montoya]] investigates a series of mob killings carried out by a [[crossbow]]-wielding vigilante. Finding Harley's necklace at the scene of the Ace Chemicals explosion, Montoya notes that Harley is in danger without the Joker's protection. She approaches Dinah about being an informant on Roman for them, but Dinah rejects the offer.\n\nRoman sends Dinah and his sadistic right-hand-man [[Victor Zsasz]] to retrieve a diamond embedded with the account numbers to the fortune of the Bertinelli crime family, who were massacred years ago. Young pickpocket [[Cassandra Cain|Cassandra \"Cass\" Cain]] steals the diamond from Zsasz, but swallows it after she is arrested. Harley, fleeing from Montoya and several other people she had wronged in the past, is captured by Roman's men. Zsasz informs Roman that Cassandra has the diamond, and Dinah warns Montoya about the situation. As Roman tortures Harley and prepares to have her killed, she offers to recover the diamond for him. Roman agrees but also places a bounty on Cass to shake up the competition. Breaking into the GCPD with a variety of [[Fireworks|firework]]-inspired [[Riot gun#Impact rounds|non-lethal grenade launcher rounds]], Harley frees Cassandra and the pair escape to the evidence warehouse. They are ambushed by a number of thugs, but manage to kill them all.\n\nAfter escaping from the evidence warehouse, Harley and Cassandra bond while hiding out at the former's apartment. Doc is approached for information by the \"crossbow killer\", who is revealed to be [[Huntress (Helena Bertinelli)|Helena Bertinelli]]. Having survived her family's massacre and becoming trained as an assassin, Helena has been targeting each of the gangsters responsible for her family's murders, preferring the moniker of \"The Huntress\". Quinn's apartment is later bombed by criminals looking for Cass, and Doc sorrowfully reveals that he betrayed Harley, selling them out for money. Harley calls Roman and offers to turn Cassandra over in exchange for his protection, agreeing to meet at an abandoned amusement park (mostly one of the Joker's former hideouts). Dinah notifies Montoya of the rendezvous, while Zsasz notices Dinah's treacherous text message en route to the park and informs Roman. Devastated by Dinah's betrayal, Roman dons his ritualistic mask from which he gets his villainous nickname, \"Black Mask\".\n\nAt the park, Montoya confronts Harley, but Harley knocks her out of a window. Zsasz arrives and tranquilizes Harley before holding Dinah at gunpoint, but he is killed by Helena, who reveals Zsasz was the last of her family's killers. Montoya returns and a stand-off ensues, until they realize Roman has arrived with a small army of masked criminals, known collectively as the [[Black Mask (character)#Fictional character biography|False Face Society]]. Using Quinn's old gear, the makeshift team successfully withstand and repel their attack. During the battle, Cass is captured by Roman, while Dinah reveals her [[metahuman]] ability of supersonic-level screaming, defeating an additional number of mobsters aligned with Roman. Harley gives chase on roller skates, and with assistance from Helena, the pair pursue Roman. At a nearby pier, the final confrontation occurs. Taking aim at a shadowy figure in the distance she believes to be Roman, Harley wastes her last bullet as Roman appears from behind the figure, which is revealed to be a statue. Roman holds Cassandra hostage and prepares to kill her. However, Cassandra pulls the ring from a grenade she had taken from Harley's weapons chest earlier, slipping the grenade in Roman's jacket. Harley throws Roman from the pier just before the grenade detonates and kills him.\n\nIn the aftermath of destroying Roman's criminal empire, Montoya quits the GCPD. With the money within the accounts hidden inside the diamond, she joins Dinah and Helena in establishing a team of [[vigilante]]s \u2013 the [[Birds of Prey (team)|Birds of Prey]]. Harley and Cassandra escape, selling the diamond itself to a pawnshop and starting their own [[contract killing]] business.\n\nIn a [[Post-credits scene|post-credits audio sequence]], Harley is about to reveal a secret about [[Batman]], but the film ends mid-sentence.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Margot Robbie]] as [[Harley Quinn|Harleen Quinzel / Harley Quinn]]:<br />A former-certified [[psychiatrist]], who became a crazed criminal and the [[Joker (character)|Joker]]'s accomplice/girlfriend, and later a part of the [[Suicide Squad]].

It is the eighth film in the [[DC Extended Universe]] and a follow-up to ''[[Suicide Squad (film)|Suicide Squad]]'' (2016). It was directed by [[Cathy Yan]] and written by [[Christina Hodson]], and it stars [[Margot Robbie]], [[Mary Elizabeth Winstead]], [[Jurnee Smollett-Bell]], [[Rosie Perez]], [[Chris Messina]], [[Ella Jay Basco]], [[Ali Wong]], and [[Ewan McGregor]]. The film follows [[Harley Quinn]] as she joins forces with [[Huntress (Helena Bertinelli)|Helena Bertinelli]], [[Dinah Lance]], and [[Renee Montoya]] to save [[Cassandra Cain]] from [[Gotham City]] crime lord [[Black Mask (character)|Black Mask]].\n\nRobbie, who also served as producer, pitched the idea for ''Birds of Prey'' to [[Warner Bros.]] in 2015. The film was announced in May 2016, with Hodson being hired to write the script that November, followed by Yan signing on to direct in April 2018. The majority of the cast and crew were confirmed by December 2018. [[Principal photography]] lasted from January to April 2019 in [[Downtown Los Angeles]], parts of the [[Arts District, Los Angeles]], and soundstages at [[Warner Bros. Studios, Burbank|Warner Bros.

She is taken in by Doc, the elderly owner of a Taiwanese restaurant, and recovers from her relationship by cutting her hair, adopting a [[spotted hyena]] (whom she names after [[Batman|Bruce Wayne]]), and taking up [[roller derby]].\n\nOne night, Harley gets drunk at a [[Clubbing (subculture)|nightclub]] owned by gangster [[Black Mask (character)|Roman Sionis]], and cripples Roman's driver after he insults her. She then meets burlesque singer [[Black Canary|Dinah Lance]], who later rescues an intoxicated Harley from an attempted abduction. Spotting the scuffle from his bedroom, Roman is impressed by Dinah's skills and appoints her as his new driver. The next night, Harley blows up the Ace Chemicals plant where she pledged herself to the Joker years prior as a way to publicly announce their breakup. Meanwhile, [[Gotham City Police Department|GCPD]] Detective [[Renee Montoya]] investigates a series of mob killings carried out by a [[crossbow]]-wielding vigilante. Finding Harley's necklace at the scene of the Ace Chemicals explosion, Montoya notes that Harley is in danger without the Joker's protection. She approaches Dinah about being an informant on Roman for them, but Dinah rejects the offer.\n\nRoman sends Dinah and his sadistic right-hand-man [[Victor Zsasz]] to retrieve a diamond embedded with the account numbers to the fortune of the Bertinelli crime family, who were massacred years ago. Young pickpocket [[Cassandra Cain|Cassandra \"Cass\" Cain]] steals the diamond from Zsasz, but swallows it after she is arrested. Harley, fleeing from Montoya and several other people she had wronged in the past, is captured by Roman's men. Zsasz informs Roman that Cassandra has the diamond, and Dinah warns Montoya about the situation. As Roman tortures Harley and prepares to have her killed, she offers to recover the diamond for him. Roman agrees but also places a bounty on Cass to shake up the competition. Breaking into the GCPD with a variety of [[Fireworks|firework]]-inspired [[Riot gun#Impact rounds|non-lethal grenade launcher rounds]], Harley frees Cassandra and the pair escape to the evidence warehouse. They are ambushed by a number of thugs, but manage to kill them all.\n\nAfter escaping from the evidence warehouse, Harley and Cassandra bond while hiding out at the former's apartment. Doc is approached for information by the \"crossbow killer\", who is revealed to be [[Huntress (Helena Bertinelli)|Helena Bertinelli]]. Having survived her family's massacre and becoming trained as an assassin, Helena has been targeting each of the gangsters responsible for her family's murders, preferring the moniker of \"The Huntress\". Quinn's apartment is later bombed by criminals looking for Cass, and Doc sorrowfully reveals that he betrayed Harley, selling them out for money. Harley calls Roman and offers to turn Cassandra over in exchange for his protection, agreeing to meet at an abandoned amusement park (mostly one of the Joker's former hideouts). Dinah notifies Montoya of the rendezvous, while Zsasz notices Dinah's treacherous text message en route to the park and informs Roman. Devastated by Dinah's betrayal, Roman dons his ritualistic mask from which he gets his villainous nickname, \"Black Mask\".\n\nAt the park, Montoya confronts Harley, but Harley knocks her out of a window. Zsasz arrives and tranquilizes Harley before holding Dinah at gunpoint, but he is killed by Helena, who reveals Zsasz was the last of her family's killers. Montoya returns and a stand-off ensues, until they realize Roman has arrived with a small army of masked criminals, known collectively as the [[Black Mask (character)#Fictional character biography|False Face Society]]. Using Quinn's old gear, the makeshift team successfully withstand and repel their attack. During the battle, Cass is captured by Roman, while Dinah reveals her [[metahuman]] ability of supersonic-level screaming, defeating an additional number of mobsters aligned with Roman. Harley gives chase on roller skates, and with assistance from Helena, the pair pursue Roman. At a nearby pier, the final confrontation occurs. Taking aim at a shadowy figure in the distance she believes to be Roman, Harley wastes her last bullet as Roman appears from behind the figure, which is revealed to be a statue. Roman holds Cassandra hostage and prepares to kill her. However, Cassandra pulls the ring from a grenade she had taken from Harley's weapons chest earlier, slipping the grenade in Roman's jacket. Harley throws Roman from the pier just before the grenade detonates and kills him.\n\nIn the aftermath of destroying Roman's criminal empire, Montoya quits the GCPD. With the money within the accounts hidden inside the diamond, she joins Dinah and Helena in establishing a team of [[vigilante]]s \u2013 the [[Birds of Prey (team)|Birds of Prey]]. Harley and Cassandra escape, selling the diamond itself to a pawnshop and starting their own [[contract killing]] business.\n\nIn a [[Post-credits scene|post-credits audio sequence]], Harley is about to reveal a secret about [[Batman]], but the film ends mid-sentence.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Margot Robbie]] as [[Harley Quinn|Harleen Quinzel / Harley Quinn]]:<br />A former-certified [[psychiatrist]], who became a crazed criminal and the [[Joker (character)|Joker]]'s accomplice/girlfriend, and later a part of the [[Suicide Squad]].
