The film was co produced by [[Walden Media]] and [[Walt Disney Pictures]] and distributed in many markets by [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney's]] [[Film distributor|distribution company]] [[Buena Vista (brand)|Buena Vista]]. \n\n''Holes'' was released in the United States on April 18, 2003, and earned $71.4 million worldwide.<ref name=\"mojo\" /> It was later released on DVD and VHS on September 23, 2003, by [[Buena Vista Home Entertainment]] and [[Walt Disney Home Entertainment]]. The film is dedicated to [[Scott Plank]], who died in a car accident six months before the film's release.\n\n==Plot== hi this is holes\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 and 700 words. -->\nTeenager Stanley Yelnats IV lives in [[Texas]] with his family, who have been cursed to be unlucky \u2013 a misfortune they blame on their ancestor Elya's failure to keep a promise to fortune teller Madame Zeroni years ago in Latvia. One day, Stanley is wrongfully convicted of stealing a pair of sneakers that were donated to charity by baseball player Clyde \"Sweet Feet\" Livingston, and is sentenced to 18 months at Camp Green Lake, a juvenile detention camp, in lieu of jail time. \n\nHe arrives to find that the camp is a dried up lake run by the warden, Louise Walker, her assistant Mr. Sir, and camp counselor Dr. Kiowa Pendanski. Prisoners who are known by their nicknames \u2013 including Zero, Zig-Zag, Armpit, Squid, X-Ray, and Magnet \u2013 spend each day digging holes in the desert; they may earn a day off if the inmates find anything interesting. During one night, Mr. Sir saves Stanley from a yellow-spotted lizard, which he warns Stanley are aggressive, venomous, and lethal. After finding a golden lipstick tube initialed K.B. and a fossil, Stanley is accepted into the group and is given the nickname Caveman. \n\nAfter taking the blame for Magnet's stealing of Mr. Sir's sunflower seeds, Stanley is taken to the warden's house where old wanted posters and newspapers lead him to suspect that \"KB\" stands for Katherine \"Kissin' Kate\" Barlow, a school teacher turned outlaw from the past. Walker asks Stanley to grab her box of nail polish and mentions that it contains rattlesnake venom. After he and Mr. Sir explain what happened with the sunflower seeds, Walker injures Mr. Sir and allows Stanley to return to his hole.\n\nCamp Green Lake's history is revealed in a series of flashbacks throughout the film. In the 19th century, Green Lake is a flourishing lakeside community. Barlow is involved in a love triangle with the wealthy Charles \"Trout\" Walker, whom Barlow rejects, and an [[African-Americans|African-American]] onion seller named Sam, whom Barlow loves. One night, the jealous Walker and the town's citizens burn down the schoolhouse and kill Sam. In retaliation, Barlow kills the local sheriff who ignored her pleas for help and becomes an outlaw hunting down Walker's men; at one point, she steals Elya's son Stanley's chest of gold. Twenty years later, the now-bankrupt Walkers track down Barlow and demand she hand over her treasure. Barlow refuses and tells them to dig for the treasure, after which Barlow dies from a lizard bite and the Walkers set about digging for the treasure.\n \nIn the present, when Pendanski mocks Zero, who is actually Hector Zeroni, the latter hits Pendanski with a shovel and runs off. After some deliberation, Stanley searches for Hector. The pair have difficulty surviving in the desert without water. Eventually, Stanley carries the now ill Hector up the mountain where they find a wild field of onions and a source of water, helping them regain strength; at the same time, Stanley unknowingly fulfills his ancestor's promise to the fortune teller and breaks the curse. While camping on the mountain, Hector tells Stanley that he stole Livingston's sneakers and threw them over the bridge to evade the police, but ended by accidentally hitting Stanley's head.\n\nReturning to the camp, Stanley and Hector investigate the hole where Stanley found the lipstick and discover a chest before they are discovered by Walker, Mr. Sir, and Pendanski. They soon realize that Walker, who is a descendant of Charles \"Trout\" Walker, is using the inmates to search for his treasure. The adults are unable to steal the chest from the boys, as the hole has swarmed with lizards, passive to Stanley and Hector due to the onions they ate earlier. The adults decide to wait for the morning, when the lizards will retreat to the shade.\n\nThe next morning, the attorney general and Stanley's lawyer arrive, accompanied by police officers; the chest Stanley found is discovered to have belonged to his great grandfather before it was stolen by Barlow. Walker, Pendanski (who is a criminal impersonating a doctor), and Mr. Sir (who is revealed to be a paroled criminal named Marion Sevillo), are arrested. Stanley and Zero are released and it rains in Green Lake for the first time in over 100 years. The Yelnats family claims ownership of the chest which contains jewels, deeds, and promissory notes, which they share with Hector, who uses it to hire private investigators to locate his missing mother, and both families live a life of financial ease as neighbors.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col|colwidth=25em}}\n* [[Shia LaBeouf]] as Stanley \"Caveman\" Yelnats IV\n* [[Sigourney Weaver]] as Louise Walker, the Warden at Camp Green Lake\n* [[Jon Voight]] as Marion \"Mr. Sir\" Sevillo\n* [[Patricia Arquette]] as Katherine \"Kissin' Kate\" Barlow\n* [[Tim Blake Nelson]] as Dr. Kiowa \"Mom\" Pendanski\n* [[Khleo Thomas]] as Hector \"Zero\" Zeroni\n* [[Brenden Jefferson]] as Rex \"X-Ray\" Washburn\n* [[Jake M.

One day, Stanley is wrongfully convicted of stealing a pair of sneakers that were donated to charity by baseball player Clyde \"Sweet Feet\" Livingston, and is sentenced to 18 months at Camp Green Lake, a juvenile detention camp, in lieu of jail time. \n\nHe arrives to find that the camp is a dried up lake run by the warden, Louise Walker, her assistant Mr. Sir, and camp counselor Dr. Kiowa Pendanski. Prisoners who are known by their nicknames \u2013 including Zero, Zig-Zag, Armpit, Squid, X-Ray, and Magnet \u2013 spend each day digging holes in the desert; they may earn a day off if the inmates find anything interesting. During one night, Mr. Sir saves Stanley from a yellow-spotted lizard, which he warns Stanley are aggressive, venomous, and lethal. After finding a golden lipstick tube initialed K.B. and a fossil, Stanley is accepted into the group and is given the nickname Caveman. \n\nAfter taking the blame for Magnet's stealing of Mr. Sir's sunflower seeds, Stanley is taken to the warden's house where old wanted posters and newspapers lead him to suspect that \"KB\" stands for Katherine \"Kissin' Kate\" Barlow, a school teacher turned outlaw from the past. Walker asks Stanley to grab her box of nail polish and mentions that it contains rattlesnake venom. After he and Mr. Sir explain what happened with the sunflower seeds, Walker injures Mr. Sir and allows Stanley to return to his hole.\n\nCamp Green Lake's history is revealed in a series of flashbacks throughout the film. In the 19th century, Green Lake is a flourishing lakeside community. Barlow is involved in a love triangle with the wealthy Charles \"Trout\" Walker, whom Barlow rejects, and an [[African-Americans|African-American]] onion seller named Sam, whom Barlow loves. One night, the jealous Walker and the town's citizens burn down the schoolhouse and kill Sam. In retaliation, Barlow kills the local sheriff who ignored her pleas for help and becomes an outlaw hunting down Walker's men; at one point, she steals Elya's son Stanley's chest of gold. Twenty years later, the now-bankrupt Walkers track down Barlow and demand she hand over her treasure. Barlow refuses and tells them to dig for the treasure, after which Barlow dies from a lizard bite and the Walkers set about digging for the treasure.\n \nIn the present, when Pendanski mocks Zero, who is actually Hector Zeroni, the latter hits Pendanski with a shovel and runs off. After some deliberation, Stanley searches for Hector. The pair have difficulty surviving in the desert without water. Eventually, Stanley carries the now ill Hector up the mountain where they find a wild field of onions and a source of water, helping them regain strength; at the same time, Stanley unknowingly fulfills his ancestor's promise to the fortune teller and breaks the curse. While camping on the mountain, Hector tells Stanley that he stole Livingston's sneakers and threw them over the bridge to evade the police, but ended by accidentally hitting Stanley's head.\n\nReturning to the camp, Stanley and Hector investigate the hole where Stanley found the lipstick and discover a chest before they are discovered by Walker, Mr. Sir, and Pendanski. They soon realize that Walker, who is a descendant of Charles \"Trout\" Walker, is using the inmates to search for his treasure. The adults are unable to steal the chest from the boys, as the hole has swarmed with lizards, passive to Stanley and Hector due to the onions they ate earlier. The adults decide to wait for the morning, when the lizards will retreat to the shade.\n\nThe next morning, the attorney general and Stanley's lawyer arrive, accompanied by police officers; the chest Stanley found is discovered to have belonged to his great grandfather before it was stolen by Barlow. Walker, Pendanski (who is a criminal impersonating a doctor), and Mr. Sir (who is revealed to be a paroled criminal named Marion Sevillo), are arrested. Stanley and Zero are released and it rains in Green Lake for the first time in over 100 years. The Yelnats family claims ownership of the chest which contains jewels, deeds, and promissory notes, which they share with Hector, who uses it to hire private investigators to locate his missing mother, and both families live a life of financial ease as neighbors.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col|colwidth=25em}}\n* [[Shia LaBeouf]] as Stanley \"Caveman\" Yelnats IV\n* [[Sigourney Weaver]] as Louise Walker, the Warden at Camp Green Lake\n* [[Jon Voight]] as Marion \"Mr. Sir\" Sevillo\n* [[Patricia Arquette]] as Katherine \"Kissin' Kate\" Barlow\n* [[Tim Blake Nelson]] as Dr. Kiowa \"Mom\" Pendanski\n* [[Khleo Thomas]] as Hector \"Zero\" Zeroni\n* [[Brenden Jefferson]] as Rex \"X-Ray\" Washburn\n* [[Jake M.
