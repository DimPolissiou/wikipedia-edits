The region falls within the greater Canadian country of [[Inuit Nunangat]]. The settlement area includes territory in [[Labrador]] extending to the [[Quebec]] border. In 2002, the Labrador Inuit Association submitted a proposal for limited autonomy to the [[government of Newfoundland and Labrador]]. The constitution was ratified on 1 December 2005, at which time the Labrador Inuit Association ceased to exist, and the new Government of Nunatsiavut was established, initially being responsible for health, education and cultural affairs. It is also responsible for setting and conducting elections, the first of which was executed in October 2006.

After the defeat of the Italian colonial army in 1942, Eritrea was administered by the [[British Military Administration (Eritrea)|British Military Administration]] until 1952. Following the UN General Assembly decision, in 1952, Eritrea would govern itself with a local Eritrean parliament but for foreign affairs and defense it would enter into a federal status with Ethiopia for a period of 10 years. However, in 1962 the government of Ethiopia annulled the Eritrean parliament and formally annexed Eritrea, but the Eritreans who had argued for complete Eritrean independence since the ouster of the Italians in 1941 anticipated what was coming and, in 1961, organized the [[Eritrean Liberation Front]] in opposition. In 1991, after 30 years of continuous armed struggle for independence, the Eritrean liberation fighters entered the capital city, Asmara, in victory.\n\nThe [[sovereign state]]  is a [[totalitarian]] [[one-party]] [[dictatorship]] in which [[Elections in Eritrea|national legislative and presidential elections]] have never been held since independence.<ref name=\"gi\"/><ref name=\"Eritrea\u2019s Silent Totalitarianism - McGill Journal of Political Studies\" /> According to [[Human Rights Watch]], the [[Human rights in Eritrea|Eritrean government's human rights record]] is among the worst in the world.<ref name=\"hrw\"/> The Eritrean government has dismissed these allegations as politically motivated.<ref name=\"Tesf\">{{cite web|title=HUMAN RIGHTS AND ERITREA'S REALITY|url=http://www.tesfanews.net/wp-content/uploads/Human-Rights-and-Eritreas-Reality.pdf|website=E Smart|publisher=E Smart Campaign|accessdate=12 June 2013|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140819084731/http://www.tesfanews.net/wp-content/uploads/Human-Rights-and-Eritreas-Reality.pdf|archive-date=19 August 2014}}</ref> The compulsory military service requires long, indefinite conscription periods (6.5 years on average), which some Eritreans leave the country to avoid.<ref name=\"National service in Eritrea\"/> Because all local media is state-owned, Eritrea was also ranked as having the third-least press freedom in the global [[Press Freedom Index]], behind [[North Korea]] and [[Turkmenistan]].\n\nThe [[sovereign state]] of Eritrea is a member of the [[African Union]], the [[United Nations]], and the [[Intergovernmental Authority on Development]], and is an [[Member_states_of_the_Arab_League#List_of_current_observer_states|observer state]] in the [[Arab League]] alongside [[Brazil]], [[Venezuela]] and [[Turkey]].<ref name=\"edition.cnn.com\">[http://edition.cnn.com/2013/07/30/world/meast/arab-league-fast-facts/ Arab League Fast Facts \u2013 CNN.com].

The scientists from the [[Egyptian Museum]] and the [[University of California]] used oxygen [[isotope]] analysis to examine hairs from two baboon mummies that had been preserved in the [[British Museum]]. One of the baboons had distorted isotopic data, so the other's oxygen isotope values were compared to those of present-day baboon specimens from regions of interest.

It is bordered to the northeast and east by the [[Red Sea]], [[Sudan]] to the west, [[Ethiopia]] to the south, and [[Djibouti]] to the southeast. Eritrea lies between latitudes [[12th parallel north|12\u00b0]] and [[18th parallel north|18\u00b0N]], and longitudes [[36th meridian east|36\u00b0]] and [[44th meridian east|44\u00b0E]].\n\nThe country is virtually bisected by a branch of the [[East African Rift]]. Eritrea, at the southern end of the Red Sea, is the home of the fork in the rift. The [[Dahlak Archipelago]] and its fishing grounds are situated off the sandy and arid coastline.\n\n[[File:Dahlak reliefmap.png|thumb|left|upright|150px|The [[Dahlak Archipelago]]]]\n[[File:Dahlak Islands ISS042.jpg|thumb|left|upright|150px|Dahlak Islands in the Red Sea as seen from the International Space Station]]\n\nEritrea can be split into three [[ecoregion]]s. To the east of the highlands are the hot, arid coastal plains stretching down to the southeast of the country. The cooler, more fertile highlands, reaching up to 3000 m, have a different habitat. Habitats here vary from the [[Tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests|sub-tropical rainforest]] at Filfil Solomona to the precipitous cliffs and [[canyon]]s of the southern highlands.<ref>{{cite web|title=Eritrea|publisher=fatbirder.com|url=http://www.fatbirder.com/links_geo/africa/eritrea.html}}</ref>\nThe [[Afar Triangle]] or Danakil Depression of Eritrea is the probable location of a [[triple junction]] where three tectonic plates are pulling away from one another.

At the time of independence in 1993, Eritrea was arranged into ten provinces. These provinces were similar to the nine provinces operating during the colonial period. In 1996, these were consolidated into six regions (zobas). The boundaries of these new regions are based on catchment basins.\n{{clear}}\n\n== Largest cities ==\n{{Largest cities of Eritrea}}\n\n==Transportation==\n{{main|Transport in Eritrea}}\n[[File:Eritrean mountai road archietcture.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|right|Eritrean mountain road]]\nTransport in Eritrea includes highways, airports, railway, and seaports in addition to various forms of public and private vehicular, maritime and aerial transportation.\n\nThe Eritrean highway system is named according to the road classification. The three levels of classification are: primary (P), secondary (S), and tertiary (T). The lowest level road is tertiary and serves local interests. Typically they are improved earth roads which are occasionally paved. During the wet seasons these roads typically become impassable.\n\nThe next higher level road is a secondary road and typically is a single-layered asphalt road that connects district capitals together and those to the regional capitals. Roads that are considered primary roads are those that are fully asphalted (throughout their entire length) and in general they carry traffic between all the major cities and towns in Eritrea.\n[[File:Eritrean Railway - 2008-11-04-edit4.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Eritrean steam train]]\n[[File:Train Asmara Eritrea.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|280px|Steam train outside [[Asmara]] on the [[Eritrean Railway]].]]\nAs of 1999, there is a total of 317 kilometres of {{Track gauge|950 mm}} (narrow gauge) rail line in Eritrea.

During the coffee ceremony, there are traditions that are upheld. The coffee is served in three rounds: the first brew or round is called ''awel'' in Tigrinya (meaning \"first\"), the second round is called ''kalaay'' (meaning \"second\"), and the third round is called ''bereka'' (meaning \"to be blessed\").\n\nTraditional Eritrean attire is quite varied among the ethnic groups of Eritrea. In the larger cities, most people dress in Western casual dress such as jeans and shirts. In offices, both men and women often dress in suits.

After the defeat of the Italian colonial army in 1942, Eritrea was administered by the [[British Military Administration (Eritrea)|British Military Administration]] until 1952. Following the UN General Assembly decision, in 1952, Eritrea would govern itself with a local Eritrean parliament but for foreign affairs and defense it would enter into a federal status with Ethiopia for a period of 10 years. However, in 1962 the government of Ethiopia annulled the Eritrean parliament and formally annexed Eritrea, but the Eritreans who had argued for complete Eritrean independence since the ouster of the Italians in 1941 anticipated what was coming and, in 1961, organized the [[Eritrean Liberation Front]] in opposition. In 1991, after 30 years of continuous armed struggle for independence, the Eritrean liberation fighters entered the capital city, Asmara, in victory.\n\nThe [[sovereign state]]  is a [[totalitarian]] [[one-party]] [[dictatorship]] in which [[Elections in Eritrea|national legislative and presidential elections]] have never been held since independence.<ref name=\"gi\"/><ref name=\"Eritrea\u2019s Silent Totalitarianism - McGill Journal of Political Studies\" /> According to [[Human Rights Watch]], the [[Human rights in Eritrea|Eritrean government's human rights record]] is among the worst in the world.<ref name=\"hrw\"/> The Eritrean government has dismissed these allegations as politically motivated.<ref name=\"Tesf\">{{cite web|title=HUMAN RIGHTS AND ERITREA'S REALITY|url=http://www.tesfanews.net/wp-content/uploads/Human-Rights-and-Eritreas-Reality.pdf|website=E Smart|publisher=E Smart Campaign|accessdate=12 June 2013|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140819084731/http://www.tesfanews.net/wp-content/uploads/Human-Rights-and-Eritreas-Reality.pdf|archive-date=19 August 2014}}</ref> The compulsory military service requires long, indefinite conscription periods (6.5 years on average), which some Eritreans leave the country to avoid.<ref name=\"National service in Eritrea\"/> Because all local media is state-owned, Eritrea was also ranked as having the third-least press freedom in the global [[Press Freedom Index]], behind [[North Korea]] and [[Turkmenistan]].\n\nThe [[sovereign state]] of Eritrea is a member of the [[African Union]], the [[United Nations]], and the [[Intergovernmental Authority on Development]], and is an [[Member_states_of_the_Arab_League#List_of_current_observer_states|observer state]] in the [[Arab League]] alongside [[Brazil]], [[Venezuela]] and [[Turkey]].<ref name=\"edition.cnn.com\">[http://edition.cnn.com/2013/07/30/world/meast/arab-league-fast-facts/ Arab League Fast Facts \u2013 CNN.com].

During the coffee ceremony, there are traditions that are upheld. The coffee is served in three rounds: the first brew or round is called ''awel'' in Tigrinya (meaning \"first\"), the second round is called ''kalaay'' (meaning \"second\"), and the third round is called ''bereka'' (meaning \"to be blessed\").\n\nTraditional Eritrean attire is quite varied among the ethnic groups of Eritrea. In the larger cities, most people dress in Western casual dress such as jeans and shirts. In offices, both men and women often dress in suits. A common traditional clothing for [[Christians|Christian]] Tigrayan highlanders consists of bright white gowns called ''[[zuria]]s'' for the women, and a white shirt accompanied by white pants for the men.
