He also served as [[Chief of the General Staff of the Red Army|Chief of the General Staff]], [[Minister of Defence (Soviet Union)|Minister of Defence]], and was a member of the [[Politburo of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Presidium of the Communist Party]] (later Politburo). During the [[World War II|Second World War]], Zhukov oversaw some of the [[Red Army]]'s most decisive victories.\n\nBorn to a poor peasant family from central Russia, Zhukov was conscripted into the [[Imperial Russian Army]] and fought in the [[World War I|First World War]]. He served in the Red Army during the [[Russian Civil War]]. Gradually rising through the ranks, by 1939 Zhukov was given command of an army group and won a decisive battle over Japanese forces at [[Battles of Khalkhin Gol|Khalkhin Gol]], for which he won the first of his four [[Hero of the Soviet Union]] awards. In February 1941, Zhukov was appointed as chief of the Red Army's General Staff.\n\nFollowing the [[Operation Barbarossa|German invasion of the Soviet Union]], Zhukov lost his position as chief of the general staff. Subsequently, he organized the defense of [[Siege of Leningrad|Leningrad]], [[Battle of Moscow|Moscow]], and [[Battle of Stalingrad|Stalingrad]]. He participated in planning several major offensives, including the [[Battle of Kursk]] and [[Operation Bagration]]. In 1945, Zhukov commanded the [[1st Belorussian Front]]; he took part in the [[Vistula\u2013Oder Offensive]] and the [[Battle of Berlin]], which resulted in the [[defeat of Nazi Germany]], and the [[Victory in Europe Day|end of the war in Europe]]. In recognition of Zhukov's role in the war, he was chosen to accept the [[German Instrument of Surrender]].\n\nAfter the war, Zhukov's success and popularity caused [[Joseph Stalin]] to see him as a potential threat. Stalin stripped him of his positions and relegated him to military commands of little strategic significance. After Stalin's death in 1953, Zhukov returned to favour; he supported [[Nikita Khrushchev]]'s bid for Soviet leadership. In 1955, he was appointed as Defence Minister and made a member of the [[Presidium]]. In 1957 Zhukov lost favour again and was forced to retire. He never returned to a position of influence and died in 1974.\n\n== Career ==\nBorn into a poverty-stricken peasant family of [[Russians|Russian]]<ref>[http://www.warheroes.ru/hero/hero.asp?Hero_id=1612 \u0413\u0435\u0440\u043e\u0438 \u0421\u0442\u0440\u0430\u043d\u044b]</ref> ethnicity in [[Zhukov, Kaluga Oblast|Strelkovka]], [[Maloyaroslavets|Maloyaroslavsky]], [[Kaluga Governorate]], Zhukov later moved to [[Moscow]], where he was apprenticed as a [[furrier]].\n\nZhukov thought he had inherited his strength from his mother. His father had been orphaned and adopted at age two by Ms. Anuska Zhukova; he became a shoemaker.\n\n=== World War I ===\nIn 1915, Zhukov was conscripted into the [[Imperial Russian Army]], where he served in the 10th Dragoon Novgorod Regiment. During [[World War I]], Zhukov was awarded the [[Cross of St. George]] twice, and promoted to the rank of [[non-commissioned officer]] for his bravery in battle.\n\nHe joined the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Bolshevik Party]] after the 1917 [[October Revolution]]; in party circles his background of poverty became a significant asset. After recovering from a serious case of [[Epidemic typhus|typhus]], he fought in the [[Russian Civil War]], serving with the [[1st Cavalry Army]], among other formations. He received the [[Order of the Red Banner]] for his part in subduing the [[Tambov Rebellion]] in 1921.<ref>{{in lang|ru}} B. V.

The [[Soviet\u2013Japanese Border Wars]] lasted from 1938 to 1939. What began as a border skirmish rapidly escalated into a full-scale war, with the Japanese pushing forward with an estimated 80,000&nbsp;troops, 180&nbsp;tanks and 450&nbsp;aircraft.\n\nThese events led to the strategically decisive [[battle of Khalkhin Gol]]. Zhukov requested major reinforcements, and on 20 August 1939, his Soviet offensive commenced. After a massive artillery barrage, nearly 500&nbsp;[[BT-5]] and [[BT-7]] tanks advanced,{{sfn|Coox|1985|p=579}} supported by over 500&nbsp;fighters and bombers.{{sfn|Coox|1985|p=590}} This was the [[Soviet Air Force]]'s first fighter-bomber operation.{{sfn|Coox|1985|p=633}}\n\n[[File:\u041a\u043e\u043c\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0443\u044e\u0449\u0438\u0439 1-\u0439 \u0430\u0440\u043c\u0435\u0439\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u0433\u0440\u0443\u043f\u043f\u043e\u0439 \u043a\u043e\u043c\u043a\u043e\u0440 \u0416\u0443\u043a\u043e\u0432 \u0432 \u0432\u043e\u0439\u0441\u043a\u0430\u0445 \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0434 \u043d\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0443\u043f\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435\u043c.jpg|thumb|Zhukov speaking with his troops on the front before an offensive, August 1939]]\n\nThe offensive first appeared to be a typical conventional frontal attack. However, two tank brigades were initially held back and then ordered to advance around on both flanks, supported by motorized artillery, infantry, and other tanks. This daring and successful manoeuvre encircled the [[Sixth Army (Japan)|Japanese 6th Army]] and captured the enemy's vulnerable rear supply areas. By 31 August, the Japanese had been cleared from the disputed border, leaving the Soviets clearly victorious.{{sfn|Coox|1985|p=633}}\n\nThis campaign had significance beyond the immediate tactical and local outcome. Zhukov demonstrated and tested the techniques later used against the Germans in the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front of the Second World War]]. His innovations included the deployment of [[underwater bridge]]s, and improving the cohesion and battle-effectiveness of inexperienced units by adding a few experienced, battle-hardened troops to bolster morale and overall training.{{sfn|Coox|1985|pp=991\u2013998}}\n\nEvaluation of the problems inherent in the performance of the BT tanks led to the replacement of their fire-prone petrol (gasoline) engines with [[diesel engine]]s. This battle provided valuable practical knowledge that was essential to the success in development of the [[T-34]] medium tank used in World War II. After this campaign, veterans were transferred to untested units, to better spread the benefits of their battle experience.{{sfn|Coox|1985|p=998}}\n\nFor his victory, Zhukov was declared a [[Hero of the Soviet Union]]. However, the campaign\u2014and especially Zhukov's pioneering use of tanks\u2014remained little known outside the Soviet Union. Zhukov considered Khalkhin Gol to be invaluable preparation for conducting operations during the Second World War.{{sfn|Coox|1985|p=996}} In 1940, Zhukov became an army general.\n\n=== Pre-war military exercises ===\n[[File:\u0416\u0443\u043a\u043e\u0432 \u0438 \u0422\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0448\u0435\u043d\u043a\u043e, 1940 \u0433\u043e\u0434.jpg|thumb|upright|Zhukov and [[Semyon Timoshenko]] in 1940]]\nIn the fall of 1940, Zhukov started preparing the plans for the [[military exercise]] concerning the defence of the Western border of the Soviet Union.

A war hero, hugely popular with the military, Zhukov was viewed by Stalin as a potential threat to his leadership. He replaced Zhukov with [[Vasily Sokolovsky]] on 10 April 1946.

On 5 March 1953, at 09:50, Stalin died of a stroke. Following Stalin's passing, Zhukov's life entered a new phase.{{sfn|Axell|2003|p=356}}\n\n=== Relationship with Stalin ===\n[[File:\u041f\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0434 \u041f\u043e\u0431\u0435\u0434\u044b \u043d\u0430 \u041a\u0440\u0430\u0441\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u043f\u043b\u043e\u0449\u0430\u0434\u0438 24 \u0438\u044e\u043d\u044f 1945 \u0433. (23).jpg|thumb|Zhukov with Stalin and [[Semyon Budyonny]] during the Soviet Victory Parade of 1945]]\nDuring the war, Zhukov was one of only a few people who understood Stalin's personality. As the chief of staff and deputy supreme commander, Zhukov had hundreds of meetings with Stalin, both private and during [[Stavka]] conferences. Consequently, Zhukov understood Stalin's personality and methods well. According to Zhukov, Stalin was a strong and secretive person, but he was also hot-tempered and skeptical. Zhukov was able to gauge Stalin's mood: for example, when Stalin drew deeply on his tobacco pipe, it was a sign of a good mood. Conversely, if Stalin failed to light his pipe once it was out of tobacco, it was a sign of imminent rage.<ref>G. K. Zhukov. ''Reminiscences and Reflections''. vol.&nbsp;2, pp.&nbsp;139, 150.</ref> His outstanding knowledge of Stalin's personality was an asset that allowed him to deal with Stalin's outbursts in a way other Soviet generals could not.{{sfn|Axell|2003|p=280}}\n\nBoth Zhukov and Stalin were hot-tempered, and both made concessions necessary to sustain their relationship. While Zhukov viewed his relationship with Stalin as one of a subordinate\u2013senior, Stalin was in awe and possibly jealous of Zhukov. Both were military commanders, but Stalin's experience was limited to a previous generation of non-mechanized warfare. By contrast, Zhukov was highly influential in the development of contemporary combined operations of highly mechanized armies. The differences in their outlooks were the cause of many tempestuous disagreements between the two of them at Stavka meetings. Nonetheless, Zhukov was less competent than Stalin as a politician, highlighted by Zhukov's many failures in politics. Stalin's unwillingness to value Zhukov beyond the marshal's military talents was one of the reasons why Zhukov was recalled from Berlin.{{sfn|Chaney|1996}}\n\nSignificant to their relationships as well was Zhukov's bluntness towards his superior. Stalin was dismissive of the fawning of many of his entourage and openly criticized it.{{sfn|Shtemenko|1989|p=587}} Many people around Stalin\u2014including Beria, Yezhov, and Mekhlis\u2014felt obliged to flatter Stalin to remain on his good side.{{sfn|Vasilevsky|1973|p=62}} Zhukov remained obstinate and argumentative, and did not hesitate to publicly contradict Stalin to the point of risking his career and life. Their heated argument about whether to abandon Kiev due to the Germans' rapid advance in summer of 1941 was typical of Zhukov's approach.<ref>A. I. Sethi. ''Marshal Zhukov: The Great Strategician''. New Delhi: 1988, p. 187.</ref> Zhukov's ability to remain skeptical and unwavering at giving into pressure did garner him the respect of Stalin.\n\n== After Stalin ==\n\n=== Arresting Beria ===\nAfter Stalin's death, Zhukov returned to favour, becoming Deputy Defence Minister in 1953. He then had an opportunity to avenge himself on Beria. With Stalin's sudden death, the Soviet Union fell into a leadership crisis. [[Georgy Malenkov]] temporarily became First Secretary. Malenkov and his allies attempted to purge Stalin's influence and personality cult; however, Malenkov himself did not have the courage to do this alone. Moreover, [[Lavrentiy Beria]] remained dangerous. The politicians sought reinforcement from the powerful and prestigious military men. In this matter, [[Nikita Khrushchev]] chose Zhukov because the two had forged a good relationship, and, in addition, during World War II, Zhukov had twice saved Khrushchev from false accusations.{{sfn|Vasilevsky|1973|p=137}}<ref>Sergei Khrushchev (1990).

Beria came to the meeting with an uneasy feeling because it was called hastily\u2014indeed, Zhukov had ordered General [[Kirill Moskalenko]] to secretly prepare a special force and permitted the force to use two of Zhukov's and Bulganin's special cars (which had black glass) in order to safely infiltrate the [[Kremlin]]. Zhukov also ordered him to replace the [[Ministry of Internal Affairs (Russia)|MVD]] Guard with the guard of the Moscow Military District. In this meeting, Khrushchev, Malenkov and their allies denounced \"the imperialist element Beria\" for his \"anti-Party\", \"anti-socialist\" activities, \"sowing division\", and \"acting as a spy of England,\"{{uncited quote|date=July 2019}} together with many other crimes.\n\nFinally, Khrushchev suggested expelling Beria from the Communist Party and bringing him before a military court. Immediately, the prepared special force rushed in. Zhukov himself went up to Beria and shouted: \"Hands up! Follow me,\" Beria replied, in a panic, \"Oh Comrades, what's the matter? Just sit down.\"{{uncited quote|date=July 2019}} Zhukov shouted again, \"Shut up, you are not the commander here!

Zhukov and most of the Presidium were not, however, eager to see a full-scale intervention in Hungary. Zhukov even recommended the withdrawal of Soviet troops when it seemed that they might have to take extreme measures to suppress the revolution.\n\nThe mood in the Presidium changed again when Hungary's new Prime Minister, [[Imre Nagy]], began to talk about Hungarian withdrawal from the [[Warsaw Pact]]. That led the Soviets to attack the revolutionaries and to replace Nagy with [[J\u00e1nos K\u00e1d\u00e1r]]. In the same years, when the UK, France, and Israel invaded Egypt during the [[Suez crisis]], Zhukov expressed support for Egypt's right of self-defence. In October 1957, Zhukov visited Yugoslavia and Albania aboard the {{sclass-|Chapayev|cruiser}} ''Kuibyshev'', attempting to repair the [[Tito\u2013Stalin split]] of 1948.{{sfn|Spahr|1993|pp=235\u2013238}} During the voyage, ''Kuibyshev'' encountered units of the [[U.S. Sixth Fleet]] and \"passing honours\" were exchanged between the vessels.\n\n=== Fall from power===\n[[File:\u0413\u0435\u043e\u0440\u0433\u0438\u0439 \u041a\u043e\u043d\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0442\u0438\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447 \u0416\u0443\u043a\u043e\u0432 \u0432 \u0432\u043e\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u0444\u043e\u0440\u043c\u0435.jpg|thumb|upright|Zhukov {{circa|1960}}]]\nOn his 60th birthday, in 1956, Zhukov received his fourth [[Hero of the Soviet Union]] title&nbsp;\u2013 making him the first person to receive the honor four times. The only other four time recipient was [[Leonid Brezhnev]]. He became the highest-ranking military professional who was also a member of the Presidium of the Central Committee of the Communist Party. He further became a symbol of national strength. Zhukov's prestige was even higher than the police and security agencies of the USSR, and thus rekindled concerns among political leaders.\n\nGoing even further than Khrushchev, Zhukov demanded that the political agencies in the Red Army report to him before the Party. He demanded an official condemnation of Stalin's crimes during the [[Great Purge]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}} He also supported the political vindication and rehabilitation for [[Mikhail Tukhachevsky]], [[Grigoriy Shtern]], [[Vasily Blyukher]], [[Alexander Yegorov (soldier)|Alexander Yegorov]] and many others. In response his opponents accused him of being a Reformist and [[Bonapartist]]. Such enviousness and hostility proved to be the key factor that led to his later downfall.{{sfn|Spahr|1993|p=391}}\n\nThe relationship between Zhukov and Khrushchev reached its peak during the [[20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] in 1956. After becoming the First Secretary of the Party, Khrushchev moved against Stalin's legacy and criticised his personality cult in a speech, \"[[On the Cult of Personality and Its Consequences]].\" To complete such startling acts, Khrushchev needed the approval\u2014or at least the acquiescence\u2014of the military, headed by Minister of Defense Zhukov.\n\nAt the [[plenary session]] of [[Central Committee of CPSU]] held in June 1957 Zhukov supported Khrushchev against the \"[[Anti-Party Group]]\", that had a majority in the Presidium and voted to replace Khrushchev as First Secretary with Bulganin. At that plenum, Zhukov stated: \"The Army is against this resolution and not even a tank will leave its position without my order!\"{{sfn|Afanasyev|1989|pp=151\u2013152}}\n\nIn the same session the \"Anti-Party Group\" was condemned and Zhukov was made a member of Presidium. But, in that same year, he was removed from the Presidium of the Party's Central Committee and the Ministry of Defense, entering forced retirement at age 62. These things happened behind his back, when he was on a trip to Albania at the invitation of General Colonel [[Beqir Balluku]].{{sfn|Chaney|1996|pp=444\u2013445}} The same issue of the ''[[Krasnaya Zvezda]]'' that announced Zhukov's return also reported that he had been relieved of his duties.{{sfn|Spahr|1993|p=238}} According to many researchers, Soviet politicians\u2014including Khrushchev himself\u2014had a deep-seated fear of \"powerful people.\"{{sfn|Afanasyev|1989|p=152}}{{sfn|Chaney|1996|pp=453\u2013455}}\n\n== Retirement ==\n[[File:\u0413\u0435\u043e\u0440\u0433\u0438\u0439 \u041a\u043e\u043d\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0442\u0438\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447 \u0416\u0443\u043a\u043e\u0432 \u043d\u0430 \u043e\u0442\u0434\u044b\u0445\u0435 \u0432 \u0421\u043e\u0447\u0438.jpg|thumb|upright|Zhukov on vacation to [[Sochi]]]]\nAfter being forced out of the government, Zhukov stayed away from politics.

(2008) Ike: An American Hero</ref>\n\nAfter Khrushchev was deposed in October 1964, Brezhnev restored Zhukov to favour\u2014though not to power\u2014in a move to use Zhukov's popularity to strengthen his political position. Zhukov's name was put in the public eye yet again when Brezhnev lionised Zhukov in a speech commemorating the Great Patriotic War. On 9 May 1965, Zhukov was invited to sit on the tribune of the Lenin Mausoleum and given the honour of reviewing the parade of military forces in [[Red Square]].{{sfn|Axell|2003|p=277}}\n\nZhukov had begun writing his memoirs, ''Memories and Recollections'', in 1958. He now worked intensively on them, which together with steadily deteriorating health, served to worsen his [[heart disease]]. In December 1967, Zhukov had a serious stroke. He was hospitalised until June 1968, and continued to receive medical and rehabilitative treatment at home under the care of his second wife, Galina Semyonova, a former officer in the Medical Corps. The stroke left him paralysed on his left side, his speech became slurred and he could only walk with assistance.\n\nHis memoirs were published in 1969 and became a best-seller. Within several months of the date of publication of his memoirs, Zhukov had received more than 10,000 letters from readers that offered comments, expressed gratitude, gave advice, or lavished praise. Supposedly, the Communist Party invited Zhukov to participate in the [[24th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] in 1971, but the invitation was rescinded.{{sfn|Spahr|1993|p=411}}\n\n== Death ==\nOn 18 June 1974, Zhukov died after another stroke.

The excerpts included criticism of the 1937\u20131939 purges for annihilating \"[M]any thousands of outstanding party workers\" and stated that Stalin had played no role in directing the war effort, although he often issued orders devised by the general staff as if they were his own.<ref>{{cite news|title=Soviets Print Excerpts of Attack by Zhukov on Stalin's War Role |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/01/21/world/soviets-print-excerpts-of-attack-by-zhukov-on-stalin-s-war-role.html|accessdate=20 March 2018|work=New York Times|date=January 21, 1989}}</ref>\n\nAppraisals of Zhukov's career vary.

December 1896&nbsp;\u2013 18 June 1974) was a [[General officer|Soviet general]] and [[Marshal of the Soviet Union]]. He also served as [[Chief of the General Staff of the Red Army|Chief of the General Staff]], [[Minister of Defence (Soviet Union)|Minister of Defence]], and was a member of the [[Politburo of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Presidium of the Communist Party]] (later Politburo). During the [[World War II|Second World War]], Zhukov oversaw some of the [[Red Army]]'s most decisive victories.\n\nBorn to a poor peasant family from central Russia, Zhukov was conscripted into the [[Imperial Russian Army]] and fought in the [[World War I|First World War]]. He served in the Red Army during the [[Russian Civil War]]. Gradually rising through the ranks, by 1939 Zhukov was given command of an army group and won a decisive battle over Japanese forces at [[Battles of Khalkhin Gol|Khalkhin Gol]], for which he won the first of his four [[Hero of the Soviet Union]] awards. In February 1941, Zhukov was appointed as chief of the Red Army's General Staff.\n\nFollowing the [[Operation Barbarossa|German invasion of the Soviet Union]], Zhukov lost his position as chief of the general staff. Subsequently, he organized the defense of [[Siege of Leningrad|Leningrad]], [[Battle of Moscow|Moscow]], and [[Battle of Stalingrad|Stalingrad]]. He participated in planning several major offensives, including the [[Battle of Kursk]] and [[Operation Bagration]]. In 1945, Zhukov commanded the [[1st Belorussian Front]]; he took part in the [[Vistula\u2013Oder Offensive]] and the [[Battle of Berlin]], which resulted in the [[defeat of Nazi Germany]], and the [[Victory in Europe Day|end of the war in Europe]]. In recognition of Zhukov's role in the war, he was chosen to accept the [[German Instrument of Surrender]].\n\nAfter the war, Zhukov's success and popularity caused [[Joseph Stalin]] to see him as a potential threat. Stalin stripped him of his positions and relegated him to military commands of little strategic significance. After Stalin's death in 1953, Zhukov returned to favour; he supported [[Nikita Khrushchev]]'s bid for Soviet leadership. In 1955, he was appointed as Defence Minister and made a member of the [[Presidium]]. In 1957 Zhukov lost favour again and was forced to retire. He never returned to a position of influence and died in 1974.\n\n== Career ==\nBorn into a poverty-stricken peasant family of [[Russians|Russian]]<ref>[http://www.warheroes.ru/hero/hero.asp?Hero_id=1612 \u0413\u0435\u0440\u043e\u0438 \u0421\u0442\u0440\u0430\u043d\u044b]</ref> ethnicity in [[Zhukov, Kaluga Oblast|Strelkovka]], [[Maloyaroslavets|Maloyaroslavsky]], [[Kaluga Governorate]], Zhukov later moved to [[Moscow]], where he was was apprenticed as a [[furrier]].\n\nZhukov thought he had inherited his strength from his mother. His father had been orphaned and adopted at age two by Ms. Anuska Zhukova; he became a shoemaker.\n\n=== World War I ===\nIn 1915, Zhukov was conscripted into the [[Imperial Russian Army]], where he served in the 10th Dragoon Novgorod Regiment. During [[World War I]], Zhukov was awarded the [[Cross of St. George]] twice, and promoted to the rank of [[non-commissioned officer]] for his bravery in battle.\n\nHe joined the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Bolshevik Party]] after the 1917 [[October Revolution]]; in party circles his background of poverty became a significant asset. After recovering from a serious case of [[Epidemic typhus|typhus]], he fought in the [[Russian Civil War]], serving with the [[1st Cavalry Army]], among other formations. He received the [[Order of the Red Banner]] for his part in subduing the [[Tambov Rebellion]] in 1921.<ref>{{in lang|ru}} B. V.

The [[Soviet\u2013Japanese Border Wars]] lasted from 1938 to 1939. What began as a border skirmish rapidly escalated into a full-scale war, with the Japanese pushing forward with an estimated 80,000&nbsp;troops, 180&nbsp;tanks and 450&nbsp;aircraft.\n\nThese events led to the strategically decisive [[battle of Khalkhin Gol]]. Zhukov requested major reinforcements, and on 20 August 1939, his Soviet offensive commenced. After a massive artillery barrage, nearly 500&nbsp;[[BT-5]] and [[BT-7]] tanks advanced,{{sfn|Coox|1985|p=579}} supported by over 500&nbsp;fighters and bombers.{{sfn|Coox|1985|p=590}} This was the [[Soviet Air Force]]'s first fighter-bomber operation.{{sfn|Coox|1985|p=633}}\n\n[[File:\u041a\u043e\u043c\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0443\u044e\u0449\u0438\u0439 1-\u0439 \u0430\u0440\u043c\u0435\u0439\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u0433\u0440\u0443\u043f\u043f\u043e\u0439 \u043a\u043e\u043c\u043a\u043e\u0440 \u0416\u0443\u043a\u043e\u0432 \u0432 \u0432\u043e\u0439\u0441\u043a\u0430\u0445 \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0434 \u043d\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0443\u043f\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435\u043c.jpg|thumb|Zhukov speaking with his troops on the front before an offensive, August 1939]]\n\nThe offensive first appeared to be a typical conventional frontal attack. However, two tank brigades were initially held back and then ordered to advance around on both flanks, supported by motorized artillery, infantry, and other tanks. This daring and successful manoeuvre encircled the [[Sixth Army (Japan)|Japanese 6th Army]] and captured the enemy's vulnerable rear supply areas. By 31 August, the Japanese had been cleared from the disputed border, leaving the Soviets clearly victorious.{{sfn|Coox|1985|p=633}}\n\nThis campaign had significance beyond the immediate tactical and local outcome. Zhukov demonstrated and tested the techniques later used against the Germans in the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front of the Second World War]]. His innovations included the deployment of [[underwater bridge]]s, and improving the cohesion and battle-effectiveness of inexperienced units by adding a few experienced, battle-hardened troops to bolster morale and overall training.{{sfn|Coox|1985|pp=991\u2013998}}\n\nEvaluation of the problems inherent in the performance of the BT tanks led to the replacement of their fire-prone petrol (gasoline) engines with [[diesel engine]]s. This battle provided valuable practical knowledge that was essential to the success in development of the [[T-34]] medium tank used in World War II. After this campaign, veterans were transferred to untested units, to better spread the benefits of their battle experience.{{sfn|Coox|1985|p=998}}\n\nFor his victory, Zhukov was declared a [[Hero of the Soviet Union]]. However, the campaign\u2014and especially Zhukov's pioneering use of tanks\u2014remained little known outside the Soviet Union. Zhukov considered Khalkhin Gol to be invaluable preparation for conducting operations during the Second World War.{{sfn|Coox|1985|p=996}} In 1940, Zhukov became an army general.\n\n=== Pre-war military exercises ===\n[[File:\u0416\u0443\u043a\u043e\u0432 \u0438 \u0422\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0448\u0435\u043d\u043a\u043e, 1940 \u0433\u043e\u0434.jpg|thumb|upright|Zhukov and [[Semyon Timoshenko]] in 1940]]\nIn the fall of 1940, Zhukov started preparing the plans for the [[military exercise]] concerning the defence of the Western border of the Soviet Union.

On 5 March 1953, at 09:50, Stalin died of a stroke. Following Stalin's passing, Zhukov's life entered a new phase.{{sfn|Axell|2003|p=356}}\n\n=== Relationship with Stalin ===\n[[File:\u041f\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0434 \u041f\u043e\u0431\u0435\u0434\u044b \u043d\u0430 \u041a\u0440\u0430\u0441\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u043f\u043b\u043e\u0449\u0430\u0434\u0438 24 \u0438\u044e\u043d\u044f 1945 \u0433. (23).jpg|thumb|Zhukov with Stalin and [[Semyon Budyonny]] during the Soviet Victory Parade of 1945]]\nDuring the war, Zhukov was one of only a few people who understood Stalin's personality. As the chief of staff and deputy supreme commander, Zhukov had hundreds of meetings with Stalin, both private and during [[Stavka]] conferences. Consequently, Zhukov understood Stalin's personality and methods well. According to Zhukov, Stalin was a strong and secretive person, but he was also hot-tempered and skeptical. Zhukov was able to gauge Stalin's mood: for example, when Stalin drew deeply on his tobacco pipe, it was a sign of a good mood. Conversely, if Stalin failed to light his pipe once it was out of tobacco, it was a sign of imminent rage.<ref>G. K. Zhukov. ''Reminiscences and Reflections''. vol.&nbsp;2, pp.&nbsp;139, 150.</ref> His outstanding knowledge of Stalin's personality was an asset that allowed him to deal with Stalin's outbursts in a way other Soviet generals could not.{{sfn|Axell|2003|p=280}}\n\nBoth Zhukov and Stalin were hot-tempered, and both made concessions necessary to sustain their relationship. While Zhukov viewed his relationship with Stalin as one of a subordinate\u2013senior, Stalin was in awe and possibly jealous of Zhukov. Both were military commanders, but Stalin's experience was limited to a previous generation of non-mechanized warfare. By contrast, Zhukov was highly influential in the development of contemporary combined operations of highly mechanized armies. The differences in their outlooks were the cause of many tempestuous disagreements between the two of them at Stavka meetings. Nonetheless, Zhukov was less competent than Stalin as a politician, highlighted by Zhukov's many failures in politics. Stalin's unwillingness to value Zhukov beyond the marshal's military talents was one of the reasons why Zhukov was recalled from Berlin.{{sfn|Chaney|1996}}\n\nSignificant to their relationships as well was Zhukov's bluntness towards his superior. Stalin was dismissive of the fawning of many of his entourage and openly criticized it.{{sfn|Shtemenko|1989|p=587}} Many people around Stalin\u2014including Beria, Yezhov, and Mekhlis\u2014felt obliged to flatter Stalin to remain on his good side.{{sfn|Vasilevsky|1973|p=62}} Zhukov remained obstinate and argumentative, and did not hesitate to publicly contradict Stalin to the point of risking his career and life. Their heated argument about whether to abandon Kiev due to the Germans' rapid advance in summer of 1941 was typical of Zhukov's approach.<ref>A. I. Sethi. ''Marshal Zhukov: The Great Strategician''. New Delhi: 1988, p. 187.</ref> Zhukov's ability to remain skeptical and unwavering at giving into pressure did garner him the respect of Stalin.\n\n== After Stalin ==\n\n=== Arresting Beria ===\nAfter Stalin's death, Zhukov returned to favour, becoming Deputy Defence Minister in 1953. He then had an opportunity to avenge himself on Beria. With Stalin's sudden death, the Soviet Union fell into a leadership crisis. [[Georgy Malenkov]] temporarily became First Secretary. Malenkov and his allies attempted to purge Stalin's influence and personality cult; however, Malenkov himself did not have the courage to do this alone. Moreover, [[Lavrentiy Beria]] remained dangerous. The politicians sought reinforcement from the powerful and prestigious military men. In this matter, [[Nikita Khrushchev]] chose Zhukov because the two had forged a good relationship, and, in addition, during World War II, Zhukov had twice saved Khrushchev from false accusations.{{sfn|Vasilevsky|1973|p=137}}<ref>Sergei Khrushchev (1990).

Beria came to the meeting with an uneasy feeling because it was called hastily\u2014indeed, Zhukov had ordered General [[Kirill Moskalenko]] to secretly prepare a special force and permitted the force to use two of Zhukov's and Bulganin's special cars (which had black glass) in order to safely infiltrate the [[Kremlin]]. Zhukov also ordered him to replace the [[Ministry of Internal Affairs (Russia)|MVD]] Guard with the guard of the Moscow Military District. In this meeting, Khrushchev, Malenkov and their allies denounced \"the imperialist element Beria\" for his \"anti-Party\", \"anti-socialist\" activities, \"sowing division\", and \"acting as a spy of England,\"{{uncited quote|date=July 2019}} together with many other crimes.\n\nFinally, Khrushchev suggested expelling Beria from the Communist Party and bringing him before a military court. Immediately, the prepared special force rushed in. Zhukov himself went up to Beria and shouted: \"Hands up! Follow me,\" Beria replied, in a panic, \"Oh Comrades, what's the matter? Just sit down.\"{{uncited quote|date=July 2019}} Zhukov shouted again, \"Shut up, you are not the commander here!

He successfully opposed the re-establishment of the [[Commissar]] system, because the Party and political leaders were not professional military, and thus the highest power should fall to the army commanders. Until 1955, Zhukov had both sent and received letters from Eisenhower. Both leaders agreed that the two superpowers should coexist peacefully.<ref name=Eisen>John Eisenhower (1974).

Zhukov and most of the Presidium were not, however, eager to see a full-scale intervention in Hungary. Zhukov even recommended the withdrawal of Soviet troops when it seemed that they might have to take extreme measures to suppress the revolution.\n\nThe mood in the Presidium changed again when Hungary's new Prime Minister, [[Imre Nagy]], began to talk about Hungarian withdrawal from the [[Warsaw Pact]]. That led the Soviets to attack the revolutionaries and to replace Nagy with [[J\u00e1nos K\u00e1d\u00e1r]]. In the same years, when the UK, France, and Israel invaded Egypt during the [[Suez crisis]], Zhukov expressed support for Egypt's right of self-defence. In October 1957, Zhukov visited Yugoslavia and Albania aboard the {{sclass-|Chapayev|cruiser}} ''Kuibyshev'', attempting to repair the [[Tito\u2013Stalin split]] of 1948.{{sfn|Spahr|1993|pp=235\u2013238}} During the voyage, ''Kuibyshev'' encountered units of the [[U.S. Sixth Fleet]] and \"passing honours\" were exchanged between the vessels.\n\n=== Fall from power===\n[[File:\u0413\u0435\u043e\u0440\u0433\u0438\u0439 \u041a\u043e\u043d\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0442\u0438\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447 \u0416\u0443\u043a\u043e\u0432 \u0432 \u0432\u043e\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u0444\u043e\u0440\u043c\u0435.jpg|thumb|upright|Zhukov {{circa|1960}}]]\nOn his 60th birthday, in 1956, Zhukov received his fourth [[Hero of the Soviet Union]] title&nbsp;\u2013 making him the first person to receive the honor four times. The only other four time recipient was [[Leonid Brezhnev]]. He became the highest-ranking military professional who was also a member of the Presidium of the Central Committee of the Communist Party. He further became a symbol of national strength. Zhukov's prestige was even higher than the police and security agencies of the USSR, and thus rekindled concerns among political leaders.\n\nGoing even further than Khrushchev, Zhukov demanded that the political agencies in the Red Army report to him before the Party. He demanded an official condemnation of Stalin's crimes during the [[Great Purge]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}} He also supported the political vindication and rehabilitation for [[Mikhail Tukhachevsky]], [[Grigoriy Shtern]], [[Vasily Blyukher]], [[Alexander Yegorov (soldier)|Alexander Yegorov]] and many others. In response his opponents accused him of being a Reformist and [[Bonapartist]]. Such enviousness and hostility proved to be the key factor that led to his later downfall.{{sfn|Spahr|1993|p=391}}\n\nThe relationship between Zhukov and Khrushchev reached its peak during the [[20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] in 1956. After becoming the First Secretary of the Party, Khrushchev moved against Stalin's legacy and criticised his personality cult in a speech, \"[[On the Cult of Personality and Its Consequences]].\" To complete such startling acts, Khrushchev needed the approval\u2014or at least the acquiescence\u2014of the military, headed by Minister of Defense Zhukov.\n\nAt the [[plenary session]] of [[Central Committee of CPSU]] held in June 1957 Zhukov supported Khrushchev against the \"[[Anti-Party Group]]\", that had a majority in the Presidium and voted to replace Khrushchev as First Secretary with Bulganin. At that plenum, Zhukov stated: \"The Army is against this resolution and not even a tank will leave its position without my order!\"{{sfn|Afanasyev|1989|pp=151\u2013152}}\n\nIn the same session the \"Anti-Party Group\" was condemned and Zhukov was made a member of Presidium. But, in that same year, he was removed from the Presidium of the Party's Central Committee and the Ministry of Defense, entering forced retirement at age 62. These things happened behind his back, when he was on a trip to Albania at the invitation of General Colonel [[Beqir Balluku]].{{sfn|Chaney|1996|pp=444\u2013445}} The same issue of the ''[[Krasnaya Zvezda]]'' that announced Zhukov's return also reported that he had been relieved of his duties.{{sfn|Spahr|1993|p=238}} According to many researchers, Soviet politicians\u2014including Khrushchev himself\u2014had a deep-seated fear of \"powerful people.\"{{sfn|Afanasyev|1989|p=152}}{{sfn|Chaney|1996|pp=453\u2013455}}\n\n== Retirement ==\n[[File:\u0413\u0435\u043e\u0440\u0433\u0438\u0439 \u041a\u043e\u043d\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0442\u0438\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447 \u0416\u0443\u043a\u043e\u0432 \u043d\u0430 \u043e\u0442\u0434\u044b\u0445\u0435 \u0432 \u0421\u043e\u0447\u0438.jpg|thumb|upright|Zhukov on vacation to [[Sochi]]]]\nAfter being forced out of the government, Zhukov stayed away from politics. Many people\u2014including former subordinates\u2014frequently paid him visits, joined him on hunting excursions, and waxed nostalgic. In September 1959, while visiting the United States, Khrushchev told President Eisenhower that the retired Marshal Zhukov \"liked fishing.\" Zhukov was actually a keen [[aquarist]].<ref>{{Cite journal|title= Erinnerungen an Ornithologen, die ich kannte| journal=J.

Zhukov respected this gift so much that he is said to have exclusively used Eisenhower's fishing tackle for the remainder of his life.<ref>Korda, M. (2008) Ike: An American Hero</ref>\n\nAfter Khrushchev was deposed in October 1964, Brezhnev restored Zhukov to favour\u2014though not to power\u2014in a move to use Zhukov's popularity to strengthen his political position. Zhukov's name was put in the public eye yet again when Brezhnev lionised Zhukov in a speech commemorating the Great Patriotic War. On 9 May 1965, Zhukov was invited to sit on the tribune of the Lenin Mausoleum and given the honour of reviewing the parade of military forces in [[Red Square]].{{sfn|Axell|2003|p=277}}\n\nZhukov had begun writing his memoirs, ''Memories and Recollections'', in 1958. He now worked intensively on them, which together with steadily deteriorating health, served to worsen his [[heart disease]]. In December 1967, Zhukov had a serious stroke. He was hospitalised until June 1968, and continued to receive medical and rehabilitative treatment at home under the care of his second wife, Galina Semyonova, a former officer in the Medical Corps. The stroke left him paralysed on his left side, his speech became slurred and he could only walk with assistance.\n\nHis memoirs were published in 1969 and became a best-seller. Within several months of the date of publication of his memoirs, Zhukov had received more than 10,000 letters from readers that offered comments, expressed gratitude, gave advice, or lavished praise. Supposedly, the Communist Party invited Zhukov to participate in the [[24th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] in 1971, but the invitation was rescinded.{{sfn|Spahr|1993|p=411}}\n\n== Death ==\nOn 18 June 1974, Zhukov died after another stroke.

The virus infects only rabbits, and has been used in some countries to control feral rabbit populations.\n\n== RHDV and RHDV2 ==\n\nRabbit haemorrhagic disease viruses (RHDV) are single strand RNA viruses in the genus Lagovirus and the family Caliciviridae. In the course of its evolution RHDV split into six distinct genotypes,<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Kerr |first1=P. J. |last2=Kitchen |first2=A. |last3=Holmes |first3=E.

In addition, non-pathogenic rabbit caliciviruses related to but distinct from RHDV have been identified in Europe and Australia.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Capucci |first1=L. |last2=Fusi |first2=P. |last3=Lavazza |first3=A. |last4=Pacciarini |first4=M.L. |last5=Rossi |first5=C. |title=Detection and preliminary characterization of a new rabbit calicivirus related to rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus but nonpathogenic |journal=Journal of Virology |date=December 1996 |volume=70 |issue=12 |pages=8614-8623}}</ref>\n\nThe two strains of rabbit hemorrhagic disease currently of medical significance are RHDV and RHDV2. RHDV (sometimes referred to as RHDV1, or as classical RHD) only affects adult European rabbits (''Oryctolagus cuniculus''). This virus was first reported in China in 1984,<ref name=Liu1984>{{cite journal |last1=Liu |first1=S.J. |last2=Xue |first2=H.P. |last3=Pu |first3=B.Q. |last4=Qian |first4=N.H. |title=A new viral disease in rabbits |journal=Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Medicine (Xumu yu Shouyi) |date=1984 |volume=16 |issue=6 |pages=253-255}}</ref> from which it spread to much of Asia, Europe, Australia, and elsewhere. There have been a few isolated outbreaks of RHDV in the United States and Mexico, but they remained localized and were eradicated.\n\nIn 2010, a new lagovirus with a distinct antigenic profile was identified in France. This virus also caused RHD but behaved differently from RHDV in that it was able to cause disease in vaccinated and young rabbits as well as in hares ''(Lepus spp.)''.<ref name=Capucci2017 /> All these features strongly suggested that the virus was not derived from RHDV but from some other unknown source.<ref name=Capucci2017 />  The new virus was named rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus 2 (RHDV2). RHDV2 is distinct enough from RHDV that the two require different vaccines, which are only partially cross protective. RHDV2 has since spread to the majority of Europe as well as to Australia and Canada.\n\n== History ==\nRabbit hemorrhagic disease caused by RHDV first appeared in the Winter of 1983 in Jiangsu Province of the [[People's Republic of China]]. It was first isolated and characterized by S.J.

Fourteen million domesticated rabbits died within nine months in the outbreak.<ref name=IAS>[http://www.cfsph.iastate.edu/Factsheets/pdfs/rabbit_hemorrhagic_disease.pdf Center for Food Security and Public Health]</ref>\n\nFrom China, RHDV spread westward and reached Europe in 1988. The virus has since appeared in Mexico, [[Cuba]], Australia, New Zealand, the United States and Canada.<ref name=Merck/> In 1992, the United Kingdom reported its first case of RHDV in domestic show rabbits. By the late 1990s, RHDV stretched to forty countries and had become [[endemic]] in [[Wild animal|wild]] and [[feral]] rabbit populations in Europe, Australia, New Zealand and [[Cuba]].<ref name=IAS/> In Europe, there was a rapid increase in research into RHD, due to the importance of the commercial breeding of rabbits for meat and fur production.\n\nThe first reported case of RHDV in the United States was in Iowa on March 9, 2000. The affected breeds included [[List of rabbit breeds|Palominos]] and [[Californian rabbit|California Whites]]. By April 6, 25 of the 27 affected rabbits had died of the infection.

However, in late August it was confirmed that RHDV had been deliberately and illegally introduced to the [[Cromwell, New Zealand|Cromwell]] area of the [[South Island]].\n\nAn unsuccessful attempt was made by New Zealand officials to control the spread of the disease. It was, however, being intentionally spread, and several farmers (notably in the [[Mackenzie Basin]] area) admitted to processing rabbits that had died from the disease in kitchen blenders for further spreading.\n\nHad the disease been introduced at a better time, there would have been a more effective control of the population. However, it was released after breeding had commenced for the season, and rabbits under 2 weeks old at the time of the introduction were resistant to the disease. These young rabbits were therefore able to survive and breed rabbit numbers back up.

Rabbits acquire RHD through oral, nasal or [[conjunctival]] pathways. Urine, feces and respiratory secretions may also shed the virus. The virus may also be carried by the wind. Carriers of the virus may remain infectious for up to a month depending on climate conditions; however, the virus has been known to persist for as little as 2 days and as long as 215 days. An infected carcass or hairs from an infected animal may also transmit RHD. Fomites such as clothing, contaminated food, cages, bedding, feeders and water will also harbour the virus. Even though the virus cannot reproduce in other mammals, predators and scavengers such as foxes, ferrets and some birds can excrete the virus through their faeces after ingesting an infected rabbit carcass. Flies, rabbit fleas, and mosquitoes can also spread the virus between rabbits.<ref name=IAS/>\n\nClimate appears to play a crucial role in the transmission of RHD. In normal conditions, most outbreaks of RHD occur in winter or spring. High temperatures in late spring and summer will considerably reduce the spread of the virus. RHD will also be more prevalent in dry and semi-dry areas than in areas that are relatively cool and humid.<ref name=strive/>\n\n== Signs ==\nRHD primarily infects only adult rabbits. In fact, research has shown that rabbits younger than 8 weeks of age are resistant to the virus. The incubation period for the RHD virus is between 1 and 3 days, with death following 1 to 2 days after the infection. There is a wide range of RHD symptoms. Most rabbits will show no signs of external symptoms of RHD.\n\nSymptomatic cases of RHD will display fever, squeals, and often coma leading to death within 12 to 36 hours. In less severe cases, rabbits may display uneasiness, excitement, [[Anorexia (symptom)|anorexia]], swollen eyelids, [[paralysis]], ocular [[haemorrhage]]s, and \"paddling\" or loss of skin. Convulsions may be seen as well. A fatal bloody discharge from the nose has been exhibited along with blood-stained cage floors, though these symptoms may have occurred after death. Rabbits who have recovered from the less severe symptoms usually develop severe [[jaundice]] with weight loss and [[lethargy]]. Diarrhoea, constipation and abdominal cramping are then exhibited right before death a few weeks later.<ref>?</ref>\n\nRHD causes rapid development of [[blood clot]] formation in major organs such as the heart, lungs and kidneys. The clots block blood vessels causing heart and respiratory failure. An infected rabbit that has died from RHD will often have its legs straight out and head over its neck.<ref name=strive/>\n\n== Diagnosis ==\nRHD may be indicated when several animals in the herd die after experiencing a fever and lethargy. [[Differential diagnosis]] includes [[pasteurellosis]], [[myxomatosis]], poisoning, heat exhaustion, and ''[[E. coli]]'' or ''[[Clostridium perfringens]]'' type E [[enterotoxemia]].\n\nRabbits that die from RHD are usually in good outward state. However, the most frequent post-mortem lesions are [[necrosis]] of the [[liver]], and [[splenomegaly]]. The liver of RHD rabbits may have a fine reticular pattern of necrosis outline each lobule and maybe yellow, gray or pale in colour. The liver is also usually [[friable]] and swollen. The spleen will be black in colour and also swollen with rounded edges, while the kidneys are dark brown in colour. [[Haemorrhages]] will also be seen many other organs and tissues. The trachea may present a foamy, bloody mucous. [[Enteritis]] of the small intestine and swollen [[meninges]] may also occur.\n\nLaboratory tests such as [[reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction]] (RT-PCR), [[Western blotting]], negative-staining immunoelectron microscopy, and [[ELISA]]s may be performed on samples from the liver, blood, spleen or other organs.\n\n== Morbidity, mortality, and immunity ==\nRHD is extremely hard to locate in the wild since about 75% of rabbits with RHD will die in their burrows underground. Due to this difficulty, the [[morbidity]] and [[Mortality rate|mortality]] estimates for RHD have a broad range. The morbidity rate ranges from 30% to 100% and the mortality rate from 40% to 100%; however, the typical mortality rate is usually around 90%.<ref name=IAS/>\n\nIn the wild, outbreaks in rabbits vary depending on the season, breeding cycles and geographical location. Some areas will see a high morbidity and mortality among its rabbit populations followed by calmer periods.\n\nMaternal antibodies such as [[immunoglobulin G]] (IgG), which are readily transmitted to the young across the placenta, may explain why very young rabbits are resistant to RHD. Some scientists also believe that the immature immune system of a young rabbit cannot produce the number of chemicals needed to initiate clotting in order to kill. Rabbits may develop immunity against other strains of the RHD virus, while others may endure persistent infections. The immunity does not survive through the next generation, leaving open the possibility of further outbreaks in the population.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Marques|first1=Raquel M|last2=Teixeira|first2=Luzia|last3=\u00c1guas|first3=Artur P|last4=Ribeiro|first4=Joana C|last5=Costa-e-Silva|first5=Ant\u00f3nio|last6=Ferreira|first6=Paula G|title=Immunosuppression abrogates resistance of young rabbits to Rabbit Haemorrhagic Disease (RHD)|journal=Veterinary Research|date=4 February 2014|volume=45|issue=1|doi=10.1186/1297-9716-45-14|pmc=3926702|pmid=24490832|pages=14}}</ref>\n\n== Control ==\nCountries that are uninfected by RHD may place restrictions on importation from endemic countries. According to the [[Merck & Co.|Merck]]/[[Merial]] Manual For Pet Health, Home Edition, 2007, RHD is a reportable disease in the United States. If a diagnosis is made by a veterinarian, a notification to the \"appropriate government authorities\" must be made.<ref name=IAS/>\n\nBecause of the highly infectious nature of the disease, strict quarantine is necessary when outbreaks occur. Depopulation, disinfection, surveillance and quarantines are the only way to properly and effectively eradicate the disease. Good disinfectants include 10% [[sodium hydroxide]], 1-2% [[formalin]], 2% One-Stroke Environ, and 10% household [[bleach]]. The RHD virus is resistant to [[ethers]] and [[chloroform]]. Deceased rabbits must be removed immediately and discarded in a safe manner. Surviving rabbits are quarantined or humanely euthanized. Test rabbits may be used to monitor the virus on vaccinated farms.<ref name=\"IAS\" />\n\nThere are several vaccines available against VHD in the UK: Cylap, made by Fort Dodge Animal Health; Lapinject, made by CEVA Animal Health; Anivac, made by Animalcare Ltd and FILAVAC, made by Filavie.

However, in late August it was confirmed that RHDV had been deliberately and illegally introduced to the [[Cromwell, New Zealand|Cromwell]] area of the [[South Island]].\n\nAn unsuccessful attempt was made by New Zealand officials to control the spread of the disease. It was, however, being intentionally spread, and several farmers (notably in the [[Mackenzie Basin]] area) admitted to processing rabbits that had died from the disease in kitchen blenders for further spreading.\n\nHad the disease been introduced at a better time, there would have been a more effective control of the population. However, it was released after breeding had commenced for the season, and rabbits under 2 weeks old at the time of the introduction were resistant to the disease.

Rabbits acquire RHD through oral, nasal or [[conjunctival]] pathways. Urine, feces and respiratory secretions may also shed the virus. The virus may also be carried by the wind. Carriers of the virus may remain infectious for up to a month depending on climate conditions; however, the virus has been known to persist for as little as 2 days and as long as 215 days. An infected carcass or hairs from an infected animal may also transmit RHD. Fomites such as clothing, contaminated food, cages, bedding, feeders and water will also harbour the virus. Even though the virus cannot reproduce in other mammals, predators and scavengers such as foxes, ferrets and some birds can excrete the virus through their faeces after ingesting an infected rabbit carcass. Flies, rabbit fleas, and mosquitoes can also spread the virus between rabbits.<ref name=IAS/>\n\nClimate appears to play a crucial role in the transmission of RHD. In normal conditions, most outbreaks of RHD occur in winter or spring. High temperatures in late spring and summer will considerably reduce the spread of the virus. RHD will also be more prevalent in dry and semi-dry areas than in areas that are relatively cool and humid.<ref name=strive/>\n\n== Signs ==\nRHD primarily infects only adult rabbits. In fact, research has shown that rabbits younger than 8 weeks of age are resistant to the virus. The incubation period for the RHD virus is between 1 and 3 days, with death following 1 to 2 days after the infection. There is a wide range of RHD symptoms. Most rabbits will show no signs of external symptoms of RHD.\n\nSymptomatic cases of RHD will display fever, squeals, and often coma leading to death within 12 to 36 hours. In less severe cases, rabbits may display uneasiness, excitement, [[Anorexia (symptom)|anorexia]], swollen eyelids, [[paralysis]], ocular [[haemorrhage]]s, and \"paddling\" or loss of skin. Convulsions may be seen as well. A fatal bloody discharge from the nose has been exhibited along with blood-stained cage floors, though these symptoms may have occurred after death. Rabbits who have recovered from the less severe symptoms usually develop severe [[jaundice]] with weight loss and [[lethargy]]. Diarrhoea, constipation and abdominal cramping are then exhibited right before death a few weeks later.<ref>?</ref>\n\nRHD causes rapid development of [[blood clot]] formation in major organs such as the heart, lungs and kidneys. The clots block blood vessels causing heart and respiratory failure. An infected rabbit that has died from RHD will often have its legs straight out and head over its neck.<ref name=strive/>\n\n== Diagnosis ==\nRHD may be indicated when several animals in the herd die after experiencing a fever and lethargy. [[Differential diagnosis]] includes [[pasteurellosis]], [[myxomatosis]], poisoning, heat exhaustion, and ''[[E. coli]]'' or ''[[Clostridium perfringens]]'' type E [[enterotoxemia]].\n\nRabbits that die from RHD are usually in good outward state. However, the most frequent post-mortem lesions are [[necrosis]] of the [[liver]], and [[splenomegaly]]. The liver of RHD rabbits may have a fine reticular pattern of necrosis outline each lobule and maybe yellow, gray or pale in colour. The liver is also usually [[friable]] and swollen. The spleen will be black in colour and also swollen with rounded edges, while the kidneys are dark brown in colour. [[Haemorrhages]] will also be seen many other organs and tissues. The trachea may present a foamy, bloody mucous. [[Enteritis]] of the small intestine and swollen [[meninges]] may also occur.\n\nLaboratory tests such as [[reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction]] (RT-PCR), [[Western blotting]], negative-staining immunoelectron microscopy, and [[ELISA]]s may be performed on samples from the liver, blood, spleen or other organs.\n\n== Morbidity, mortality, and immunity ==\nRHD is extremely hard to locate in the wild since about 75% of rabbits with RHD will die in their burrows underground. Due to this difficulty, the [[morbidity]] and [[Mortality rate|mortality]] estimates for RHD have a broad range. The morbidity rate ranges from 30% to 100% and the mortality rate from 40% to 100%; however, the typical mortality rate is usually around 90%.<ref name=IAS/>\n\nIn the wild, outbreaks in rabbits vary depending on the season, breeding cycles and geographical location. Some areas will see a high morbidity and mortality among its rabbit populations followed by calmer periods.\n\nMaternal antibodies such as [[immunoglobulin G]] (IgG), which are readily transmitted to the young across the placenta, may explain why very young rabbits are resistant to RHD. Some scientists also believe that the immature immune system of a young rabbit cannot produce the number of chemicals needed to initiate clotting in order to kill. Rabbits may develop immunity against other strains of the RHD virus, while others may endure persistent infections. The immunity does not survive through the next generation, leaving open the possibility of further outbreaks in the population.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Marques|first1=Raquel M|last2=Teixeira|first2=Luzia|last3=\u00c1guas|first3=Artur P|last4=Ribeiro|first4=Joana C|last5=Costa-e-Silva|first5=Ant\u00f3nio|last6=Ferreira|first6=Paula G|title=Immunosuppression abrogates resistance of young rabbits to Rabbit Haemorrhagic Disease (RHD)|journal=Veterinary Research|date=4 February 2014|volume=45|issue=1|doi=10.1186/1297-9716-45-14|pmc=3926702|pmid=24490832|pages=14}}</ref>\n\n== Control ==\nCountries that are uninfected by RHD may place restrictions on importation from endemic countries. According to the [[Merck & Co.|Merck]]/[[Merial]] Manual For Pet Health, Home Edition, 2007, RHD is a reportable disease in the United States. If a diagnosis is made by a veterinarian, a notification to the \"appropriate government authorities\" must be made.<ref name=IAS/>\n\nBecause of the highly infectious nature of the disease, strict quarantine is necessary when outbreaks occur. Depopulation, disinfection, surveillance and quarantines are the only way to properly and effectively eradicate the disease. Good disinfectants include 10% [[sodium hydroxide]], 1-2% [[formalin]], 2% One-Stroke Environ, and 10% household [[bleach]]. The RHD virus is resistant to [[ethers]] and [[chloroform]]. Deceased rabbits must be removed immediately and discarded in a safe manner. Surviving rabbits are quarantined or humanely euthanized. Test rabbits may be used to monitor the virus on vaccinated farms.<ref name=\"IAS\" />\n\nThere are several vaccines available against VHD in the UK: Cylap, made by Fort Dodge Animal Health; Lapinject, made by CEVA Animal Health; Anivac, made by Animalcare Ltd and FILAVAC, made by Filavie.

The major feature of the park is Bryce Canyon, which despite its name, is not a [[canyon]], but a collection of giant natural [[amphitheatre|amphitheaters]] along the eastern side of the [[Paunsaugunt Plateau]]. Bryce is distinctive due to geological structures called [[hoodoo (geology)|hoodoos]], formed by [[frost weathering]] and stream erosion of the river and lake bed [[sedimentary rock]]s. The red, orange, and white colors of the rocks provide spectacular views for park visitors. Bryce Canyon National Park is much smaller, and sits at a much higher elevation than nearby [[Zion National Park]]. The rim at Bryce varies from {{convert|8000|to|9000|ft}}.\n\nThe Bryce Canyon area was settled by [[Mormon pioneers]] in the 1850s and was named after [[Ebenezer Bryce]], who [[Homestead Acts|homesteaded]] in the area in 1874.<ref name=\"Kiver1999p523\">{{Harvard citation no brackets|Kiver|1999|p=523}}</ref> The area around Bryce Canyon was originally designated as a [[National monument (United States)|national monument]] by President [[Warren G. Harding]] in 1923 and was redesignated as a national park by Congress in 1928. The park covers {{convert|35835|acre|sqmi ha km2}}<ref name=\"area\"/> and receives substantially fewer visitors than Zion National Park (nearly 4.3 million in 2016) or Grand Canyon National Park (nearly 6 million in 2016), largely due to Bryce's more remote location.

The edge of the [[Kaiparowits Plateau]] bounds the opposite side of the valley.\n\nBryce Canyon was not formed from [[erosion]] initiated from a central stream, meaning it technically is not a [[canyon]].

The Paiute in the area developed a [[Mythologies of the indigenous peoples of North America|mythology]] surrounding the hoodoos (pinnacles) in Bryce Canyon.

His mapmakers kept many of the Paiute place names.<ref name=\"Harris1997p46\"/>\n\nSmall groups of Mormon pioneers followed and attempted to settle east of Bryce Canyon along the [[Paria River]]. In 1873, the Kanarra Cattle Company started to use the area for cattle grazing.<ref name=\"Tufts1998p73\"/>\n\n[[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] sent Scottish immigrant Ebenezer Bryce and his wife Mary to settle land in the Paria Valley because they thought his carpentry skills would be useful in the area. The Bryce family chose to live right below Bryce Amphitheater\u2014the main collection of hoodoos in the park. Bryce grazed his cattle inside what are now park borders, and reputedly thought that the amphitheaters were a \"helluva place to lose a cow.\"<ref name=\"Kiver1999p523\"/> He also built a road to the plateau to retrieve firewood and timber, and a [[canal]] to irrigate his crops and water his animals. Other settlers soon started to call the unusual place \"Bryce's canyon\", which was later formalized into Bryce Canyon.\n\nA combination of [[drought]], [[overgrazing]] and [[flood]]ing eventually drove the remaining Paiutes from the area and prompted the settlers to attempt construction of a water diversion channel from the Sevier River drainage. When that effort failed, most of the settlers, including the Bryce family, left the area.<ref name=\"Harris1997p46\"/> Bryce moved his family to [[Arizona]] in 1880.<ref name=\"TheHoodoo\"/> The remaining settlers dug a {{convert|10|mi|km|adj=on}} ditch from the Sevier's east fork into Tropic Valley.<ref name=\"Harris1997p46\"/>\n\n===Creation of the park===\n[[Image:Bryce Canyon Lodge.jpg|right|thumb|[[Bryce Canyon Lodge]] was built between 1924 and 1925 from local materials.]]\nThese scenic areas were first described for the public in magazine articles published by Union Pacific and Santa Fe railroads in 1916.<ref name=\"Kiver1999p523\"/> People like Forest Supervisor J.

A movement to have the area protected was soon started, and [[National Park Service]] Director [[Stephen Mather]] responded by proposing that Bryce Canyon be made into a state park. The governor of Utah and the [[Utah State Legislature]], however, lobbied for national protection of the area. Mather relented and sent his recommendation to President [[Warren G.

The ancient [[Sedimentary depositional environment|depositional environment]] of the region around what is now the park varied. The [[Dakota Formation|Dakota Sandstone]] and the Tropic Shale were deposited in the warm, shallow waters of the advancing and retreating [[Western Interior Seaway|Cretaceous Seaway]] (outcrops of these rocks are found just outside park borders).<ref name=\"Harris1997p51\">{{Harvard citation no brackets|Harris|1997|p=51}}</ref> The colorful [[Geology of the Bryce Canyon area#Claron flood plain and lake system|Claron Formation]], from which the park's delicate [[hoodoo (geology)|hoodoos]] are carved, was laid down as sediments in a system of cool streams and lakes that existed from 63 to about 40&nbsp;million years ago (from the [[Paleocene]] to the [[Eocene]] epochs). Different sediment types were laid down as the lakes deepened and became shallow and as the shoreline and [[river delta]]s migrated.\n\nSeveral other formations were also created but were mostly [[erosion|eroded]] away following two major periods of uplift.

The major feature of the park is Bryce Canyon, which despite its name, is not a [[canyon]], but a collection of giant natural [[amphitheatre|amphitheaters]] along the eastern side of the [[Paunsaugunt Plateau]]. Bryce is distinctive due to geological structures called [[hoodoo (geology)|hoodoos]], formed by [[frost weathering]] and stream erosion of the river and lake bed [[sedimentary rock]]s. The red, orange, and white colors of the rocks provide spectacular views for park visitors. Bryce Canyon National Park is much smaller, and sits at a much higher elevation than nearby [[Zion National Park]]. The rim at Bryce varies from {{convert|8000|to|9000|ft}}.\n\nThe Bryce Canyon area was settled by [[Mormon pioneers]] in the 1850s and was named after [[Ebenezer Bryce]], who [[Homestead Acts|homesteaded]] in the area in 1874.<ref name=\"Kiver1999p523\">{{Harvard citation no brackets|Kiver|1999|p=523}}</ref> The area around Bryce Canyon was originally designated as a [[National monument (United States)|national monument]] by President [[Warren G. Harding]] in 1923 and was redesignated as a national park by Congress in 1928. The park covers {{convert|35835|acre|sqmi ha km2}}<ref name=\"area\"/> and receives substantially fewer visitors than Zion National Park (nearly 4.3 million in 2016) or Grand Canyon National Park (nearly 6 million in 2016), largely due to Bryce's more remote location. In 2018, Bryce Canyon received 2,679,478 recreational visitors, which was an increase of 107,794 visitors from the prior year.<ref name=\"visits\"/>\n\n==Geography==\nBryce Canyon National Park lies within the [[Colorado Plateau]] [[United States physiographic region|geographic province]] of North America and straddles the southeastern edge of the Paunsaugunt Plateau west of the Paunsaugunt Fault (''Paunsaugunt'' is [[Colorado River Numic language|Paiute]] for \"home of the beaver\").<ref name=\"Harris1997p46\"/> Park visitors arrive from the plateau part of the park and look over the plateau's edge toward a valley containing the fault and the [[Paria River]] just beyond it (''Paria'' is Paiute for \"muddy or elk water\"). The edge of the [[Kaiparowits Plateau]] bounds the opposite side of the valley.\n\nBryce Canyon was not formed from [[erosion]] initiated from a central stream, meaning it technically is not a [[canyon]]. Instead [[headward erosion]] has excavated large [[amphitheatre|amphitheater]]-shaped features in the [[Cenozoic]]-aged rocks of the Paunsaugunt Plateau.<ref name=\"Harris1997p46\">{{Harvard citation no brackets|Harris|1997|p=46}}</ref> This erosion exposed delicate and colorful pinnacles called [[hoodoo (geology)|hoodoos]] that are up to {{convert|200|ft|m|-1}} high. A series of amphitheaters extends more than {{convert|20|mi|km|-1}} north-to-south within the park.<ref name=\"Harris1997p46\"/> The largest is Bryce Amphitheater, which is {{convert|12|mi|km}} long, {{convert|3|mi|km|0}} wide and {{convert|800|ft|m}} deep.<ref name=\"Harris1997p46\"/> A nearby example of amphitheaters with hoodoos in the same formation but at a higher elevation, is in [[Cedar Breaks National Monument]], which is {{convert|25|mi|km}} to the west on the [[Markagunt Plateau]].<ref name=\"Harris1997p44\"/>\n\nRainbow Point, the highest part of the park at {{convert|9105|ft|m}},<ref name=\"Harris1997p53\"/> is at the end of the {{convert|18|mi|km|adj=on}} scenic drive.<ref name=\"Harris1997p46\"/> From there, [[Aquarius Plateau]], Bryce Amphitheater, the [[Henry Mountains]], the [[Vermilion Cliffs]] and the [[Navajo Sandstone|White Cliffs]] can be seen.

Other artifacts from the [[Pueblo]]-period Anasazi and the [[Fremont culture]] (up to the mid-12th century) have also been found.<ref name=\"Tufts1998p73\">{{Harvard citation no brackets|Tufts|1998|p=73}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Southern Paiute|Paiute]] Indians moved into the surrounding valleys and plateaus in the area around the same time that the other cultures left.<ref name=\"Tufts1998p73\"/> These [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] hunted and gathered for most of their food, but also supplemented their diet with some cultivated products. The Paiute in the area developed a [[Mythologies of the indigenous peoples of North America|mythology]] surrounding the hoodoos (pinnacles) in Bryce Canyon. They believed that hoodoos were the Legend People whom the trickster [[Coyote (mythology)|Coyote]] turned to stone.<ref name=\"NPSguide\">[[#NPSguide|NPS visitor's guide]]</ref> At least one older Paiute said his culture called the hoodoos ''Anka-ku-was-a-wits'', which is Paiute for \"red painted faces\".<ref name=\"Tufts1998p73\"/>\n\n===European American exploration and settlement===\n[[Image:Bryce Cabin circa 1881.jpg|Black-and-white photo of log cabin with thatched roof|thumb|Ebenezer Bryce and his family lived in this cabin below Bryce Amphitheater (c. 1881).]]\nIt was not until the late 18th and the early 19th century that the first European Americans explored the remote and hard-to-reach area.<ref name=\"Tufts1998p73\"/> [[Mormon pioneers|Mormon scouts]] visited the area in the 1850s to gauge its potential for agricultural development, use for [[grazing]], and settlement.<ref name=\"Tufts1998p73\"/>\n\nThe first major scientific expedition to the area was led by [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] Major [[John Wesley Powell]] in 1872.<ref name=\"Tufts1998p73\"/> Powell, along with a team of mapmakers and geologists, surveyed the [[Sevier River|Sevier]] and [[Virgin River]] area as part of a larger survey of the [[Colorado Plateau]]s. His mapmakers kept many of the Paiute place names.<ref name=\"Harris1997p46\"/>\n\nSmall groups of Mormon pioneers followed and attempted to settle east of Bryce Canyon along the [[Paria River]]. In 1873, the Kanarra Cattle Company started to use the area for cattle grazing.<ref name=\"Tufts1998p73\"/>\n\n[[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] sent Scottish immigrant Ebenezer Bryce and his wife Mary to settle land in the Paria Valley because they thought his carpentry skills would be useful in the area. The Bryce family chose to live right below Bryce Amphitheater\u2014the main collection of hoodoos in the park. Bryce grazed his cattle inside what are now park borders, and reputedly thought that the amphitheaters were a \"helluva place to lose a cow.\"<ref name=\"Kiver1999p523\"/> He also built a road to the plateau to retrieve firewood and timber, and a [[canal]] to irrigate his crops and water his animals. Other settlers soon started to call the unusual place \"Bryce's canyon\", which was later formalized into Bryce Canyon.\n\nA combination of [[drought]], [[overgrazing]] and [[flood]]ing eventually drove the remaining Paiutes from the area and prompted the settlers to attempt construction of a water diversion channel from the Sevier River drainage. When that effort failed, most of the settlers, including the Bryce family, left the area.<ref name=\"Harris1997p46\"/> Bryce moved his family to [[Arizona]] in 1880.<ref name=\"TheHoodoo\"/> The remaining settlers dug a {{convert|10|mi|km|adj=on}} ditch from the Sevier's east fork into Tropic Valley.<ref name=\"Harris1997p46\"/>\n\n===Creation of the park===\n[[Image:Bryce Canyon Lodge.jpg|right|thumb|[[Bryce Canyon Lodge]] was built between 1924 and 1925 from local materials.]]\nThese scenic areas were first described for the public in magazine articles published by Union Pacific and Santa Fe railroads in 1916.<ref name=\"Kiver1999p523\"/> People like Forest Supervisor J. W. Humphrey promoted the scenic wonders of Bryce Canyon's amphitheaters, and by 1918 nationally distributed articles also helped to spark interest.<ref name=\"Tufts1998p73\"/> However, poor access to the remote area and the lack of accommodations kept visitation to a bare minimum.\n\nRuby Syrett, Harold Bowman and the Perry brothers later built modest lodging, and set up \"touring services\" in the area.<ref name=\"Tufts1998p73\"/> Syrett later served as the first [[postmaster]] of Bryce Canyon. Visitation steadily increased, and by the early 1920s the [[Union Pacific Railroad]] became interested in expanding [[Rail transportation in the United States|rail service]] into southwestern Utah to accommodate more tourists.<ref name=\"Tufts1998p73\"/>\n\n[[Image:Bryce Canyon visitors center.jpg|alt=Two story wood building next to flag pole with U.S. flag waving in the wind. Snow on ground.|thumb|left|Visitor center in winter]]\nAt the same time, [[Conservation (ethic)|conservationists]] became alarmed by the damage overgrazing, [[logging]], and unregulated visitation were having on the fragile features of Bryce Canyon. A movement to have the area protected was soon started, and [[National Park Service]] Director [[Stephen Mather]] responded by proposing that Bryce Canyon be made into a state park. The governor of Utah and the [[Utah State Legislature]], however, lobbied for national protection of the area. Mather relented and sent his recommendation to President [[Warren G. Harding]], who on June 8, 1923 declared Bryce Canyon a national monument.<ref name=\"Tufts1998p73\"/>\n\nA road was built the same year on the plateau to provide easy access to outlooks over the amphitheaters. From 1924 to 1925, [[Bryce Canyon Lodge]] was built from local timber and stone.<ref name=\"TheHoodoo_p5\">[https://www.nps.gov/brca/learn/news/newspaper.htm The Hoodoo (Summer 2005)], p. 5</ref>\n\nMembers of the United States Congress started work in 1924 on upgrading Bryce Canyon's protection status from a national monument to a national park in order to establish Utah National Park.<ref name=\"TheHoodoo_p5\" /> A process led by the [[Utah Parks Company]] for transferring ownership of private and state-held land in the monument to the federal government started in 1923.<ref name=\"Tufts1998p73\"/> The last of the land in the proposed park's borders was sold to the federal government four years later, and on February 25, 1928, the renamed Bryce Canyon National Park was established.<ref name=\"Kiver1999p524\">{{Harvard citation no brackets|Kiver|1999|p=524}}</ref>\n\nIn 1931, President [[Herbert Hoover]] annexed an adjoining area south of the park, and in 1942 an additional {{convert|635|acres}} was added.<ref name=\"Tufts1998p73\"/> This brought the park's total area to the current figure of {{convert|35835|acres}}.<ref name=\"Kiver1999p524\"/> Rim Road, the scenic drive that is still used today, was completed in 1934 by the [[Civilian Conservation Corps]].

In 2004, reconstruction began on the aging and inadequate road system in the park.\n\n==Geology==\n{{Main|Geology of the Bryce Canyon area}}\n[[File:Natural bridge in Bryce Canyon.jpg|alt=A large opening in red rock with snow on top|thumb|Erosion of [[sedimentary rock]]s has created natural arches.]]\nThe Bryce Canyon area shows a record of deposition that spans from the last part of the [[Cretaceous]] period and the first half of the [[Cenozoic]] era. The ancient [[Sedimentary depositional environment|depositional environment]] of the region around what is now the park varied. The [[Dakota Formation|Dakota Sandstone]] and the Tropic Shale were deposited in the warm, shallow waters of the advancing and retreating [[Western Interior Seaway|Cretaceous Seaway]] (outcrops of these rocks are found just outside park borders).<ref name=\"Harris1997p51\">{{Harvard citation no brackets|Harris|1997|p=51}}</ref> The colorful [[Geology of the Bryce Canyon area#Claron flood plain and lake system|Claron Formation]], from which the park's delicate [[hoodoo (geology)|hoodoos]] are carved, was laid down as sediments in a system of cool streams and lakes that existed from 63 to about 40&nbsp;million years ago (from the [[Paleocene]] to the [[Eocene]] epochs). Different sediment types were laid down as the lakes deepened and became shallow and as the shoreline and [[river delta]]s migrated.\n\nSeveral other formations were also created but were mostly [[erosion|eroded]] away following two major periods of uplift. The [[Laramide orogeny]] affected the entire western part of what would become North America starting about 70&nbsp;million to 50&nbsp;million years ago.<ref name=\"Kiver1999p524\"/> This event helped to build the [[Rocky Mountains]] and in the process closed the Cretaceous Seaway. The Straight Cliffs, Wahweap, and Kaiparowits formations were victims of this uplift. The [[Colorado Plateau]]s were uplifted 16&nbsp;million years ago and were segmented into different [[plateau]]s, each separated from its neighbors by [[fault (geology)|faults]] and each having its own uplift rate.<ref name=\"Harris1997p53\">{{Harvard citation no brackets|Harris|1997|p=53}}</ref> The Boat Mesa Conglomerate and the Sevier River Formation were removed by erosion following this uplift.\n\n[[File:Thor's Hammer - Bryce Canyon.jpg|alt=Thor's Hammer|thumb|left|Thor's Hammer]]\nThis uplift created vertical joints, which over time were preferentially eroded. The soft Pink Cliffs of the Claron Formation were eroded to form freestanding pinnacles in [[badlands]] called hoodoos, while the more resistant White Cliffs formed monoliths.<ref name=\"Harris1997p46\"/> The brown, pink and red colors are from [[hematite]] (iron oxide; {{chem|Fe|2|O|3}}); the yellows from [[limonite]] {{chem|(FeO(OH)\u00b7''n''H|2|O)}}; and the purples are from [[pyrolusite]] ({{chem|Mn||O|2}}).<ref name=\"Harris1997p50\">{{Harvard citation no brackets|Harris|1997|p=50}}</ref>  Also created were arches, [[natural arch|natural bridges]], walls, and windows. Hoodoos are composed of soft sedimentary rock and are topped by a piece of harder, less easily eroded stone that protects the column from the elements. Bryce Canyon has one of the highest concentrations of hoodoos of any place on Earth.\n\nThe formations exposed in the area of the park are part of the [[Grand Staircase]]. The oldest members of this supersequence of rock units are exposed in the [[Grand Canyon]], the intermediate ones in Zion National Park, and its youngest parts are laid bare in Bryce Canyon area. A small amount of overlap occurs in and around each park.\n\n==Ecology==\n[[Image:Winter storm at Bryce Canyon.jpg|alt=Trees with snow on them|thumb|Bryce Canyon has extensive [[fir]] forests.]]\nMore than 400 native plant species live in the park. There are three life zones in the park based on elevation:<ref name=\"TheHoodoo_p5\" />  the lowest areas of the park are dominated by dwarf forests of [[pinyon pine]] and [[juniper]] with [[manzanita]], [[Amelanchier|serviceberry]], and [[Purshia tridentata|antelope bitterbrush]] in between. [[Aspen]], [[Populus sect. Aigeiros|cottonwood]], [[Betula occidentalis|water birch]], and [[willow]] grow along streams. [[Pinus ponderosa|Ponderosa pine]] forests cover the mid-elevations with [[blue spruce]] and [[Douglas fir]] in water-rich areas and manzanita and bitterbrush as underbrush. Douglas fir and [[Abies concolor|white fir]], along with aspen and [[Picea engelmannii|Engelmann spruce]], make up the forests on the Paunsaugunt Plateau.

He was forced to leave home at the age of 14 to seek employment. He started to write in his spare time, while working at various jobs, which included working in a [[pawn shop]], as a tailor, a policeman and as a postman at one point in his life. He came to be acquainted with author [[Kubota Mantaro]], who encouraged him in his literary efforts.\n\nKawaguchi was arrested in [[Kamakura, Kanagawa]] in 1933, along with fellow literati [[Kume Masao]] and [[Satomi Ton]] for illegal card [[gambling]].\n\nIn 1935, Kawaguchi won the first [[Naoki Prize]] for a [[short story]] titled ''Tsuruhachi Tsurujir\u014d''. He followed this with a serialized [[novel]], ''Aizen Katsura'', a [[melodrama]]tic love story involving a nurse and a doctor, which ran from 1936-1938. The story became a tremendously popular bestseller and gained him considerable fame. It was later made into a movie starring [[Kinuyo Tanaka]] and [[Ken Uehara]], and was the basis of numerous [[television series]].\n\nAfter [[World War II]], Kawaguchi resumed his literary activity, publishing plays and novels. He won the Yoshikawa Eiji Prize for his novel ''Shigurejaya Oriku'', a nostalgic series of episodes involving a prostitute who rose to become a brothel owner.\n\nMany of Kawaguchi's novels were adapted to film, and he was long associated with [[Daiei Motion Picture Company]]. In 1965, he became a member of the Japan Academy of the Arts. He was awarded the [[Order of Culture]] by the Japanese government in 1973. His wife was the movie actress [[Aiko Mimasu]], and his son was actor [[Hiroshi Kawaguchi (actor)|Hiroshi Kawaguchi]].\n\nKawaguchi won the [[Yoshikawa Eiji Prize]] for his novel ''Shigurejaya Oriku'', a nostalgic series of episodes involving a farm girl, sold to a brothel, who rose to become owner of a famous Tokyo teahouse.

He was forced to leave home at the age of 14 to seek employment. He started to write in his spare time, while working at various jobs, which included working in a [[pawn shop]], as a tailor, a policeman and as a postman at one point in his life. He came to be acquainted with author [[Kubota Mantaro]], who encouraged him in his literary efforts.\n\nKawaguchi was arrested in [[Kamakura, Kanagawa]] in 1933, along with fellow literati [[Kume Masao]] and [[Satomi Ton]] for illegal card [[gambling]].\n\nIn 1935, Kawaguchi won the first [[Naoki Prize]] for a [[short story]] titled ''Tsuruhachi Tsurujir\u014d''. He followed this with a serialized [[novel]], ''Aizen Katsura'', a [[melodrama]]tic love story involving a nurse and a doctor, which ran from 1936-1938. The story became a tremendously popular bestseller and gained him considerable fame. It was later made into a movie starring [[Kinuyo Tanaka]] and [[Ken Uehara]], and was the basis of numerous [[television series]].\n\nAfter [[World War II]], Kawaguchi resumed his literary activity, publishing plays and novels. He won the Yoshikawa Eiji Prize for his novel ''Shigurejaya Oriku'', a nostalgic series of episodes involving a prostitute who rose to become a brothel owner.\n\nMany of Kawaguchi's novels were adapted to film, and he was long associated with [[Daiei Motion Picture Company]]. In 1965, he became a member of the Japan Academy of the Arts. He was awarded the [[Order of Culture]] by the Japanese government in 1973. His wife was the movie actress [[Aiko Mimasu]], and his son was actor [[Hiroshi Kawaguchi]].\n\nKawaguchi won the [[Yoshikawa Eiji Prize]] for his novel ''Shigurejaya Oriku'', a nostalgic series of episodes involving a farm girl, sold to a brothel, who rose to become owner of a famous Tokyo teahouse. The story was eventually translated into English by Royall Tyler.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Japanese literature]]\n*[[List of Japanese authors]]\n\n==References==\n* Kawaguchi, Matsutar\u014d.
