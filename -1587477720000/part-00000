For the derivation, different conditions must be taken into account and different equations can be obtained.<ref name=\"Elimelech\">M. Elimelech, J. Gregory, X. Jia, R. A. Williams, ''Particle Deposition and Aggregation Measurement: Modelling and Simulation'' (Boston: 1995).</ref> But some useful assumptions can effectively simplify the process, which are suitable for ordinary conditions. The simplified way to derive it is to add the two parts together.\n\n===van der Waals attraction===\n{{main article|van der Waals force}}\nvan der Waals force is actually the total name of dipole-dipole force, dipole-induced dipole force and dispersion forces,<ref name=\"Jacob\">Jacob N. Israelacvili, ''Intermolecular and Surface Forces'' (London 2007).</ref> in which dispersion forces are the most important part because they are always present.\nAssume that the pair potential between two atoms or small molecules is purely attractive and of the form w = -C/r<sup>n</sup>, where C is a constant for interaction energy, decided by the molecule's property and n = 6 for van der Waals attraction.<ref name=\"London\">London, F. (1937), ''Trans Faraday Soc'', '''33''', 8\u201326.</ref> With another assumption of additivity, the net interaction energy between a molecule and planar surface made up of like molecules will be the sum of the interaction energy between the molecule and every molecule in the surface body.<ref name=\"Jacob\" /> So the net interaction energy for a molecule at a distance D away from the surface will therefore be\n\n: <math>w(D) = -2 \\pi \\, C \\rho _1\\, \\int_{z=D}^{z= \\infty \\,}dz \\int_{x=0}^{x=\\infty \\,}\\frac{xdx}{(z^2+x^2)^3} = \\frac{2 \\pi C \\rho _1}{4}\\int_D^{\\infty }\\frac{dz}{z^4} = - \\frac{ \\pi C \\rho _1  }{ 6 D^3 }</math>\n\nwhere \n**''w''(''r'') is the interaction energy between the molecule and the surface\n**<math> \\rho_1 </math> is the number density of the surface.\n**''z'' is the axis perpendicular with the surface and passes across the molecule. ''z'' = D at the point where the molecule is and z = 0 at the surface.\n**''x'' is the axis perpendicular with z axis, where ''x'' = 0 at the intersection.\n\nThen the interaction energy of a large sphere of radius R and a flat surface can be calculated as\n\n: <math>W(D) = -\\frac{2 \\pi C \\rho _1 \\rho _2}{12} \\int_{z=0}^{z=2R}\\frac {(2R-z)zdz}{(D+z)^3} \\approx  -\\frac{ \\pi ^2 C \\rho _1 \\rho _2 R}{6D}</math>\n\nwhere\n** ''W''(''D'') is the interaction energy between the sphere and the surface.\n** <math>\\rho_2</math> is the number density of the sphere\n\nFor convenience, [[Hamaker constant]] A is given as\n\n: <math> A = \\pi^2C\\rho_1\\rho_2 </math>\n\nand the equation will become\n\n: <math>W(D)=-\\frac{AR}{6D} </math>\n\nWith a similar method and according to [[Derjaguin approximation]],<ref name=\"Derjaguin\">Derjaguin B. V. (1934)''Kolloid Zeits'' '''69''', 155\u2013164.</ref> the van der Waals interaction energy between particles with different shapes can be calculated, such as energy between\n\n: two spheres: <math>W(D) = -\\frac{A}{6D} \\frac{R_1 R_2}{(R_1 +R_2 )}</math>\n\n: sphere-surface: <math>W(D) = -\\frac{AR}{6D}</math>\n\n: Two surfaces: <math>W(D) = -\\frac{A}{12 \\pi D^2}</math> per unit area\n\n===Double layer force===\n{{main article|Double layer forces}}\nA surface in a liquid may be charged by dissociation of surface groups (e.g. silanol groups for glass or silica surfaces<ref>\nBehrens, S. H. and Grier, D. G., \n\"The charge on glass and silica surfaces,\" \n''Journal of Chemical Physics'' '''115''', 6716\u20136721 (2001)\n</ref>) or by adsorption of charged molecules such as polyelectrolyte from the surrounding solution. This results in the development of a wall surface potential which will attract counterions from the surrounding solution and repel co-ions. In equilibrium, the surface charge is balanced by oppositely charged counterions in solution. The region near the surface of enhanced\ncounterion concentration is called the electrical double layer (EDL). The EDL can be approximated by a sub-division into two regions. Ions in the region closest to the charged wall surface are strongly bound to the surface. This immobile layer is called the Stern or Helmholtz layer. The region adjacent to the Stern layer is called the diffuse layer and contains loosely associated ions that are comparatively mobile. The total electrical double layer due to the formation of the counterion layers results in electrostatic screening of the wall charge and minimizes the [[Gibbs free energy]] of EDL formation.\n\nThe thickness of the diffuse electric double layer is known as the [[Debye screening length]] <math>1/\\kappa</math>. At a distance of two Debye screening lengths the electrical potential energy is reduced to 2 percent of the value at the surface wall.\n\n: <math>\\kappa = \\sqrt{\\sum_i \\frac{\\rho_{\\infty i} e^2z^2_i}{\\epsilon_r \\epsilon_0 k_{\\rm B} T}}</math>\n\nwith unit of ''m''<sup>&minus;1</sup>\nwhere\n*<math>\\rho_{\\infty i}</math> is the number density of ion i in the bulk solution.\n*''z'' is the valency of the ion.

For the derivation, different conditions must be taken into account and different equations can be obtained.<ref name=\"Elimelech\">M. Elimelech, J. Gregory, X. Jia, R. A. Williams, ''Particle Deposition and Aggregation Measurement: Modelling and Simulation'' (Boston: 1995).</ref> But some useful assumptions can effectively simplify the process, which are suitable for ordinary conditions. The simplified way to derive it is to add the two parts together.\n\n===van der Waals attraction===\n{{main article|van der Waals force}}\nvan der Waals force is actually the total name of dipole-dipole force, dipole-induced dipole force and dispersion forces,<ref name=\"Jacob\">Jacob N. Israelacvili, ''Intermolecular and Surface Forces'' (London 2007).</ref> in which dispersion forces are the most important part because they are always present.\nAssume that the pair potential between two atoms or small molecules is purely attractive and of the form w = -C/r<sup>n</sup>, where C is a constant for interaction energy, decided by the molecule's property and n = 6 for van der Waals attraction.<ref name=\"London\">London, F. (1937), ''Trans Faraday Soc'', '''33''', 8\u201326.</ref> With another assumption of additivity, the net interaction energy between a molecule and planar surface made up of like molecules will be the sum of the interaction energy between the molecule and every molecule in the surface body.<ref name=\"Jacob\" /> So the net interaction energy for a molecule at a distance D away from the surface will therefore be\n\n: <math>w(D) = -2 \\pi \\, C \\rho _1\\, \\int_{z=D}^{z= \\infty \\,}dz \\int_{x=0}^{x=\\infty \\,}\\frac{xdx}{(z^2+x^2)^3} = \\frac{2 \\pi C \\rho _1}{4}\\int_D^{\\infty }\\frac{dz}{z^4} = - \\frac{ \\pi C \\rho _1  }{ 6 D^3 }</math>\n\nwhere \n**''w''(''r'') is the interaction energy between the molecule and the surface\n**<math> \\rho_1 </math> is the number density of the surface.\n**''z'' is the axis perpendicular with the surface and passes across the molecule. ''z'' = D at the point where the molecule is and z = 0 at the surface.\n**''x'' is the axis perpendicular with z axis, where ''x'' = 0 at the intersection.\n\nThen the interaction energy of a large sphere of radius R and a flat surface can be calculated as\n\n: <math>W(D) = -\\frac{2 \\pi C \\rho _1 \\rho _2}{12} \\int_{z=0}^{z=2R}\\frac {(2R-z)zdz}{(D+z)^3} \\approx  -\\frac{ \\pi ^2 C \\rho _1 \\rho _2 R}{6D}</math>\n\nwhere\n** ''W''(''D'') is the interaction energy between the sphere and the surface.\n** <math>\\rho_2</math> is the number density of the sphere\n\nFor convenience, [[Hamaker constant]] A is given as\n\n: <math> A = \\pi^2C\\rho_1\\rho_2 </math>\n\nand the equation will become\n\n: <math>W(D)=-\\frac{AR}{6D} </math>\n\nWith a similar method and according to [[Derjaguin approximation]],<ref name=\"Derjaguin\">Derjaguin B. V. (1934)''Kolloid Zeits'' '''69''', 155\u2013164.</ref> the van der Waals interaction energy between particles with different shapes can be calculated, such as energy between\n\n: two spheres: <math>W(D) = -\\frac{A}{6D} \\frac{R_1 R_2}{(R_1 +R_2 )}</math>\n\n: sphere-surface: <math>W(D) = -\\frac{AR}{6D}</math>\n\n: Two surfaces: <math>W(D) = -\\frac{A}{12 \\pi D^2}</math> per unit area\n\n===Double layer force===\n{{main article|Double layer forces}}\nA surface in a liquid may be charged by dissociation of surface groups (e.g. silanol groups for glass or silica surfaces<ref>\nBehrens, S. H. and Grier, D. G., \n\"The charge on glass and silica surfaces,\" \n''Journal of Chemical Physics'' '''115''', 6716\u20136721 (2001)\n</ref>) or by adsorption of charged molecules such as polyelectrolyte from the surrounding solution. This results in the development of a wall surface potential which will attract counterions from the surrounding solution and repel co-ions. In equilibrium, the surface charge is balanced by oppositely charged counterions in solution. The region near the surface of enhanced\ncounterion concentration is called the electrical double layer (EDL). The EDL can be approximated by a sub-division into two regions. Ions in the region closest to the charged wall surface are strongly bound to the surface. This immobile layer is called the Stern or Helmholtz layer. The region adjacent to the Stern layer is called the diffuse layer and contains loosely associated ions that are comparatively mobile. The total electrical double layer due to the formation of the counterion layers results in electrostatic screening of the wall charge and minimizes the [[Gibbs free energy]] of EDL formation.\n\nThe thickness of the diffuse electric double layer is known as the [[Debye screening length]] <math>1/\\kappa</math>. At a distance of two Debye screening lengths the electrical potential energy is reduced to 2 percent of the value at the surface wall.\n\n: <math>\\kappa = \\sqrt{\\sum_i \\frac{\\rho_{\\infty i} e^2z^2_i}{\\epsilon_r \\epsilon_0 k_{\\rm B} T}}</math>\n\nwith unit of ''m''<sup>&minus;1</sup>\nwhere\n*<math>\\rho_{\\infty i}</math> is the number density of ion i in the bulk solution.\n*''z'' is the valency of the ion.

It stars [[Robert John Burke]], [[Nancy Allen (actress)|Nancy Allen]] and [[Rip Torn]]. Set in the near future in a [[dystopia]]n metropolitan [[Detroit, Michigan]], the plot centers around [[RoboCop (character)|RoboCop]] (Burke) as he vows to avenge the death of his partner Anne Lewis (Allen) and save Detroit from falling into chaos, while evil conglomerate OCP, run by its villainous CEO (Torn), advances its tyrannical program to have the city default on its debts. It was filmed in [[Atlanta, Georgia|Atlanta]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. Most of the buildings seen in the film were slated for demolition to make way for facilities for the [[1996 Summer Olympics]] that were held in the city.\n\n''RoboCop 3'' is the first film to use digital [[morphing]] in more than one scene.<ref name=\"EGM51\"/> The film was a critical and commercial failure, only grossing $10 million worldwide against its $22 million budget, making it the least profitable film of the [[RoboCop (franchise)|''RoboCop'' franchise]].<ref name=\"mojo\" />\n\n==Plot==\nThe city of Detroit is on the verge of [[bankruptcy]] after a series of failed business plans and drop of stocks, and are now struggling with their plans to create the new Delta City. Conglomerate Omni Consumer Products (OCP) are set to have the city [[Default (finance)|default]] on their debt before purchasing the entire city. To speed up the process, OCP creates an armed force called the Urban Rehabilitators, nicknamed \"Rehabs,\" under the command of Paul McDaggett. Ostensibly its purpose is to combat rising crime in Old Detroit, augmenting the ranks of the [[Detroit Police Department]] in apprehending violent criminals. In reality, it has been set up to forcibly relocate the residents of Cadillac Heights. Nikko, a Japanese-American computer whiz kid, loses her parents in the process.\n\nThe police force is gradually superseded by the Rehabs, and violent crime begins to spiral out of control. The Delta City dream of the former OCP [[CEO]] lives on with the help of the Japanese Kanemitsu Corporation, which has bought a controlling stake in OCP and is trying to finance the plan. Kanemitsu, CEO of the Kanemitsu Corporation, sees the potential in the citywide redevelopment, and moves forward with the plans to remove the current citizens in order to create Delta City. The company develops and uses its own [[ninja]] androids called \"Otomo\" to help McDaggett and the new OCP president overcome the resistance of anti-OCP militia forces.\n\nRoboCop and partner Anne Lewis try to defend civilians from the Rehabs one night, but Lewis is mortally wounded by McDaggett and eventually dies. Unable to fight back because of his \"Fourth Directive\" programming, RoboCop is saved by members of a resistance movement composed of Nikko and residents from Cadillac Heights and eventually joins them. Due to severe damage sustained in the shoot-out, RoboCop's systems efficiency plummets, and he asks the resistance to summon Dr. Lazarus, one of the scientists who created him. Upon arrival she begins to treat him, deleting the Fourth Directive in the process. During an earlier raid on an armory, the resistance picked up a jet-pack prototype, originally intended for RoboCop's use, which Lazarus modifies and upgrades to hold RoboCop.\n\nAfter recovering from his injuries, RoboCop conducts a one-man campaign against the Rehabs and OCP. He finds McDaggett and attempts to subdue him, but McDaggett is able to escape. McDaggett then obtains information from a disgruntled resistance member regarding the location of the resistance fighters' base. The Rehabs attack and most of the resistance members are either killed or taken prisoner. RoboCop returns to the rebel base to find it abandoned. One Otomo unit arrives and attacks him. RoboCop experiences another power drain and his left arm and auto gun is destroyed, but eventually he is able to overcome his opponent with his arm-mounted gun. Nikko infiltrates the OCP building and assists a captured Lazarus in [[Broadcast signal intrusion|broadcasting]] an improvised video, revealing OCP's responsibility for the criminality in the city and implicating them in the removal and killing of the Cadillac Heights residents. The broadcast causes OCP's stock to plunge, driving the company into financial ruin and bankruptcy.\n\nMeanwhile, McDaggett decides to execute an all-out strike against Cadillac Heights with the help of the Detroit police, but the police officers, enraged at the company's sadistic ways, refuse to comply and instead defect to the resistance in order to get revenge for Anne and their salaries and pensions, escalating the rebellion against OCP into a full-scale war. As a result, McDaggett turns to hiring street gangs and hooligans to assist with his plans.\n\nHaving heard Lazarus' broadcast, RoboCop provides aerial support for the entrenched resistance forces. He then proceeds to the OCP building and confronts the waiting McDaggett. RoboCop is then attacked, and nearly defeated, by two Otomo robots. Nikko and Lazarus succeed in reprogramming them using a wireless link from a laptop computer, however, forcing them to attack each other. The Otomos' self-destruct system activate, forcing RoboCop to flee with Nikko and Lazarus. The flaming discharge from the jetpack immobilizes McDaggett, leaving him to perish in the blast.\n\nAs Old Detroit is being cleaned up, Kanemitsu arrives and finally comes face to face with RoboCop along with his group, while his translator tells the OCP president on Kanemitsu's behalf that he is fired, as the corporation shuts down OCP for good and plans to leave Detroit. Kanemitsu then bows to RoboCop and the group in respect. The CEO compliments RoboCop and asks for his name, to which he responds with, \"My friends call me Murphy. You call me RoboCop.\"\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Robert John Burke]] as [[RoboCop (character)|Alex Murphy/RoboCop]]\n* [[Remy Ryan]] as Nikko Halloran\n* [[Bruce Locke]] as Otomo\n* [[Nancy Allen (actress)|Nancy Allen]] as Anne Lewis\n* [[Jodi Long]] as Keiko Halloran\n* [[John Posey (actor)|John Posey]] as David Halloran\n* [[Rip Torn]] as The CEO\n* [[Mako Iwamatsu|Mako]] as Kanemitsu\n* [[Felton Perry]] as Donald Johnson\n* [[John Castle]] as Paul McDaggett\n* [[Jill Hennessy]] as Dr. Marie Lazarus\n* [[Robert DoQui]] as Sgt.
