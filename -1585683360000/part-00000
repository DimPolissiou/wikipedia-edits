A '''botanist''', '''peen scientist''' or '''peentologist''' is a [[scientist]] who specialises in this field. The term \"botany\" comes from the [[Ancient Greek]] word {{lang|grc|\u03b2\u03bf\u03c4\u03ac\u03bd\u03b7}} (''botan\u0113'') meaning \"[[penie]]\", \"[[Poaceae|Pubes]]\", or \"[[fodder]]\"; {{lang|grc|\u03b2\u03bf\u03c4\u03ac\u03bd\u03b7}} is in turn derived from {{lang|grc|\u03b2\u03cc\u03c3\u03ba\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd}} (''foreskein''), \"to succ\" or \"to [[Grazing|graze]]\".{{sfn|Liddell|Scott|1940}}{{sfn|Gordh|Headrick|2001|p = 134}}{{sfn|Online Etymology Dictionary|2012}}  Traditionally, botany has also included the study of [[fungus|fungi]] and [[algae]] by [[mycology|mycologists]] and [[phycology|phycologists]] respectively, with the study of these three groups of organisms remaining within the sphere of interest of the [[International Botanical Congress]]. Nowadays, botanists (in the strict sense) study approximately 410,000 [[species]] of [[Embryophyte|land plants]] of which some 391,000 species are [[vascular plant]]s (including approximately 369,000 species of [[flowering plant]]s),<ref>RBG Kew (2016).

Medieval [[physic garden]]s, often attached to [[Monastery|monasteries]], contained plants of medical importance. They were forerunners of the first [[botanical garden]]s attached to [[University|universities]], founded from the 1540s onwards. One of the earliest was the [[Orto botanico di Padova|Padua botanical garden]]. These gardens facilitated the academic study of plants. Efforts to catalogue and describe their collections were the beginnings of [[plant taxonomy]], and led in 1753 to the [[binomial nomenclature|binomial system]] of [[Carl Linnaeus]] that remains in use to this day.\n\nIn the 19th and 20th centuries, new techniques were developed for the study of plants, including methods of [[optical microscope|optical microscopy]] and [[live cell imaging]], [[electron microscopy]], analysis of [[ploidy|chromosome number]], [[phytochemistry|plant chemistry]] and the structure and function of [[enzyme]]s and other [[protein]]s. In the last two decades of the 20th century, botanists exploited the techniques of [[molecular biology|molecular genetic analysis]], including [[genomics]] and [[proteomics]] and [[DNA sequences]] to classify plants more accurately.\n\nModern botany is a broad, multidisciplinary subject with inputs from most other areas of science and technology. Research topics include the study of plant [[Plant morphology|structure]], [[cell growth|growth]] and differentiation, [[Plant reproduction|reproduction]], [[plant physiology#Biochemistry of plants|biochemistry]] and [[metabolism|primary metabolism]], [[phytochemistry|chemical products]], [[Plant morphology#Development|development]], [[plant pathology|diseases]], [[phylogenetics|evolutionary relationships]], [[systematics]], and [[Taxonomy (biology)|plant taxonomy]]. Dominant themes in 21st century plant science are [[molecular genetics]] and [[epigenetics]], which are the mechanisms and control of gene expression during differentiation of [[plant cell]]s and [[Tissue (biology)#Plant tissues|tissues]]. Botanical research has diverse applications in providing [[staple foods]], materials such as [[Lumber|timber]], [[oil]], rubber, [[Fiber|fibre]] and drugs, in modern [[horticulture]], [[agriculture]] and [[forestry]], [[plant propagation]], [[Plant breeding|breeding]] and [[genetic modification]], in the synthesis of chemicals and raw materials for construction and energy production, in [[environmental management]], and the maintenance of [[biodiversity]].\n\n== History ==\n{{Main|History of botany}}\n\n=== Early botany ===\n[[File:Cork Micrographia Hooke.png|thumb|alt=engraving of cork cells from Hooke's Micrographia, 1665|An engraving of the cells of [[Cork oak|cork]], from [[Robert Hooke]]'s ''[[Micrographia]]'', 1665]]\n\nBotany originated as [[herbalism]], the study and use of plants for their medicinal properties.{{sfn|Sumner|2000|p = 16}} Many records of the [[Holocene]] period date early botanical knowledge as far back as 10,000 years ago.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Delcourt|first=Paul A.|last2=Delcourt|first2=Hazel R.|last3=Cridlebaugh|first3=Patricia A.|last4=Chapman|first4=Jefferson|date=1986-05-01|title=Holocene ethnobotanical and paleoecological record of human impact on vegetation in the Little Tennessee River Valley, Tennessee|url= |journal=Quaternary Research|volume=25|issue=3|pages=330\u2013349|doi=10.1016/0033-5894(86)90005-0|bibcode=1986QuRes..25..330D}}</ref> This early unrecorded knowledge of plants was discovered in ancient sites of human occupation within [[Tennessee]], which make up much of the [[Cherokee]] land today.<ref name=\":0\" /> The early recorded history of botany includes many ancient writings and plant classifications.

''De Materia Medica'' was widely read for more than 1,500 years.{{sfn|Mauseth|2003|p = 532}} Important contributions from the [[Islamic Golden Age|medieval Muslim world]] include [[Ibn Wahshiyya]]'s ''Nabatean Agriculture'', [[Ab\u016b \u1e24an\u012bfa D\u012bnawar\u012b]]'s (828\u2013896) the ''Book of Plants'', and [[Ibn Bassal]]'s ''The Classification of Soils''. In the early 13th century, Abu al-Abbas al-Nabati, and [[Ibn al-Baitar]] (d. 1248) wrote on botany in a systematic and scientific manner.{{sfn|Dallal|2010|p = 197}}{{sfn|Panaino|2002|p = 93}}{{sfn|Levey|1973|p = 116}}\n\nIn the mid-16th century, \"[[botanical garden]]s\" were founded in a number of Italian universities \u2013 the [[Orto botanico di Padova|Padua botanical garden]] in 1545 is usually considered to be the first which is still in its original location. These gardens continued the practical value of earlier \"physic gardens\", often associated with monasteries, in which plants were cultivated for medical use. They supported the growth of botany as an academic subject. Lectures were given about the plants grown in the gardens and their medical uses demonstrated. Botanical gardens came much later to northern Europe; the first in England was the [[University of Oxford Botanic Garden]] in 1621. Throughout this period, botany remained firmly subordinate to medicine.{{sfn|Hill|1915}}\n\nGerman physician [[Leonhart Fuchs]] (1501\u20131566) was one of \"the three German fathers of botany\", along with theologian [[Otto Brunfels]] (1489\u20131534) and physician [[Hieronymus Bock]] (1498\u20131554) (also called Hieronymus Tragus).{{sfn|National Museum of Wales|2007}}{{sfn|Yaniv|Bachrach|2005|p = 157}} Fuchs and Brunfels broke away from the tradition of copying earlier works to make original observations of their own. Bock created his own system of plant classification.\n\nPhysician [[Valerius Cordus]] (1515\u20131544) authored a botanically and pharmacologically important herbal ''Historia Plantarum'' in 1544 and a [[pharmacopoeia]] of lasting importance, the ''Dispensatorium'' in 1546.{{sfn|Sprague|1939}} Naturalist [[Conrad von Gesner]] (1516\u20131565) and herbalist [[John Gerard]] (1545\u2013c. 1611) published herbals covering the medicinal uses of plants. Naturalist [[Ulisse Aldrovandi]] (1522\u20131605) was considered the ''father of natural history'', which included the study of plants. In 1665, using an early microscope, [[Polymath]] [[Robert Hooke]] discovered [[cell (biology)|cells]], a term he coined, in [[cork (material)|cork]], and a short time later in living plant tissue.{{sfn|Waggoner|2001}}\n\n=== Early modern botany ===\n{{Further|Taxonomy (biology)#History of taxonomy}}\n[[File:CarlvonLinne Garden.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Photograph of a garden|The [[Linnaean Garden]] of Linnaeus' residence in Uppsala, Sweden, was planted according to his ''Systema sexuale''.]]\n\nDuring the 18th century, systems of [[plant identification]] were developed comparable to [[single access key|dichotomous keys]], where unidentified plants are placed into [[taxon]]omic groups (e.g. family, genus and species) by making a series of choices between pairs of [[Character (biology)|characters]]. The choice and sequence of the characters may be artificial in keys designed purely for identification ([[single access key#Diagnostic ('artificial') versus synoptic ('natural') keys|diagnostic keys]]) or more closely related to the natural or [[taxonomic order|phyletic order]] of the [[taxon|taxa]] in synoptic keys.{{sfn|Scharf|2009|pp = 73\u2013117}} By the 18th century, new plants for study were arriving in Europe in increasing numbers from newly discovered countries and the European colonies worldwide. In 1753, [[Carl Linnaeus|Carl von Linn\u00e9]] (Carl Linnaeus) published his [[Species Plantarum]], a hierarchical classification of plant species that remains the reference point for [[International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants|modern botanical nomenclature]]. This established a standardised binomial or two-part naming scheme where the first name represented the [[genus]] and the second identified the [[species]] within the genus.{{sfn|Capon|2005|pp = 220\u2013223}} For the purposes of identification, Linnaeus's ''Systema Sexuale'' [[Linnaean taxonomy#Classification for plants|classified]] plants into 24 groups according to the number of their male sexual organs. The 24th group, ''Cryptogamia'', included all plants with concealed reproductive parts, mosses, liverworts, ferns, algae and fungi.{{sfn|Hoek|Mann|Jahns|2005|p = 9}}\n\nIncreasing knowledge of [[plant anatomy]], [[plant morphology|morphology]] and life cycles led to the realisation that there were more natural affinities between plants than the artificial sexual system of Linnaeus. [[Michel Adanson|Adanson]] (1763), [[Antoine Laurent de Jussieu|de Jussieu]] (1789), and [[Augustin Pyramus de Candolle|Candolle]] (1819) all proposed various alternative natural systems of classification that grouped plants using a wider range of shared characters and were widely followed. The [[Candollean system]] reflected his ideas of the progression of morphological complexity and the [[Bentham & Hooker system|later classification]] by [[George Bentham|Bentham]] and [[J.D. Hooker|Hooker]], which was influential until the mid-19th century, was influenced by Candolle's approach. [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]]'s publication of the ''[[On the Origin of Species|Origin of Species]]'' in 1859 and his concept of common descent required modifications to the Candollean system to reflect evolutionary relationships as distinct from mere morphological similarity.{{sfn|Starr|2009|pp =299\u2013}}\n\nBotany was greatly stimulated by the appearance of the first \"modern\" textbook, [[Matthias Jakob Schleiden|Matthias Schleiden]]'s ''{{lang|de|Grundz\u00fcge der Wissenschaftlichen Botanik}}'', published in English in 1849 as ''Principles of Scientific Botany''.{{sfn|Morton|1981|p = 377}}  Schleiden was a microscopist and an early plant anatomist who co-founded the [[cell theory]] with [[Theodor Schwann]] and [[Rudolf Virchow]] and was among the first to grasp the significance of the [[cell nucleus]] that had been described by [[Robert Brown (botanist, born 1773)|Robert Brown]] in 1831.{{sfn|Harris|2000|pp = 76\u201381}}\nIn 1855, [[Adolf Fick]] formulated [[Fick's laws of diffusion|Fick's laws]] that enabled the calculation of the rates of [[molecular diffusion]] in biological systems.{{sfn|Small|2012|pp =118\u2013}}\n\n[[File:Echeveria glauca II.jpg|thumb|''Echeveria glauca'' in a Connecticut greenhouse.

No other cells can pass on inherited characters.{{sfn|Karp|2009|p = 382}} The work of [[Katherine Esau]] (1898\u20131997) on plant anatomy is still a major foundation of modern botany.

Raunki\u00e6r]] whose system for describing [[Raunki\u00e6r plant life-form|plant life forms]] is still in use today. The concept that the composition of plant communities such as [[Temperate broadleaf and mixed forests|temperate broadleaf forest]] changes by a process of [[ecological succession]] was developed by [[Henry Chandler Cowles]], [[Arthur Tansley]] and [[Frederic Clements]]. Clements is credited with the idea of [[climax vegetation]] as the most complex vegetation that an environment can support and Tansley introduced the concept of [[ecosystem]]s to biology.{{sfn|Tansley|1935|pp=299\u2013302}}{{sfn|Willis|1997||pp=267\u2013271}}{{sfn|Morton|1981|p = 457}} Building on the extensive earlier work of [[Alphonse Pyramus de Candolle|Alphonse de Candolle]], [[Nikolai Ivanovich Vavilov|Nikolai Vavilov]] (1887\u20131943) produced accounts of the [[biogeography]], [[Center of origin|centres of origin]], and evolutionary history of economic plants.{{sfn|de Candolle|2006|pp = 9\u201325, 450\u2013465}}\n\nParticularly since the mid-1960s there have been advances in understanding of the physics of [[Plant physiology|plant physiological]] processes such as [[transpiration]] (the transport of water within plant tissues),  the temperature dependence of rates of water [[evaporation]] from the leaf surface and the [[molecular diffusion]] of water vapour and carbon dioxide through [[stomatal]] apertures.

With the rise of the related molecular-scale biological approaches of [[molecular biology]], [[genomics]], [[proteomics]] and [[metabolomics]], the relationship between the plant [[genome]] and most aspects of the biochemistry, physiology, morphology and behaviour of plants can be subjected to detailed experimental analysis.{{sfn|Ehrhardt|Frommer|2012|pp = 1\u201321}} The concept originally stated by [[Gottlieb Haberlandt]] in 1902{{sfn|Haberlandt|1902|pages=69\u201392}} that all plant cells are [[Cell potency#Totipotency|totipotent]] and can be grown ''in vitro'' ultimately enabled the use of [[genetic engineering]] experimentally to knock out a gene or genes responsible for a specific trait, or to add genes such as [[Green fluorescent protein|GFP]] that [[reporter gene|report]] when a gene of interest is being expressed. These technologies enable the biotechnological use of whole plants or plant cell cultures grown in [[bioreactors]] to synthesise [[Bt corn|pesticides]], [[Biopharmaceutics|antibiotics]] or other [[pharming (genetics)|pharmaceuticals]], as well as the practical application of [[genetically modified crops]] designed for traits such as improved yield.{{sfn|Leonelli|Charnley|Webb|Bastow|2012}}\n\nModern morphology recognises a continuum between the major morphological categories of root, stem (caulome), leaf (phyllome) and [[trichome]].{{sfn|Sattler|Jeune|1992|pp = 249\u2013262}} Furthermore, it emphasises structural dynamics.{{sfn|Sattler|1992|pp = 708\u2013714}} Modern systematics aims to reflect and discover [[Phylogenetic nomenclature|phylogenetic relationships]] between plants.{{sfn|Ereshefsky|1997|pp = 493\u2013519}}{{sfn|Gray|Sargent|1889|pp = 292\u2013293}}{{sfn|Medbury|1993|pp = 14\u201316}}{{sfn|Judd|Campbell|Kellogg|Stevens|2002|pp = 347\u2013350}} Modern [[Molecular phylogenetics]] largely ignores morphological characters, relying on DNA sequences as data.

Biological classification is the method by which botanists group organisms into categories such as [[genus|genera]] or [[species]].

The nomenclature of botanical organisms is codified in the [[International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants]] (ICN) and administered by the [[International Botanical Congress]].{{sfn|McNeill|Barrie|Buck|Demoulin|2011|p = Preamble, para. 7}}{{sfn|Mauseth|2003|pp = 528\u2013551}}\n\n[[Kingdom (biology)|Kingdom]] [[Plant]]ae belongs to [[Domain (biology)|Domain]] [[Eukarya]] and is broken down recursively until each species is separately classified.

The scientific name of a plant represents its genus and its species within the genus, resulting in a single worldwide name for each organism.{{sfn|Mauseth|2003|pp = 528\u2013551}} For example, the tiger lily is ''[[Lilium columbianum]]''. ''Lilium'' is the genus, and ''columbianum'' the [[Botanical name#Binary name|specific epithet]]. The combination is the name of the species.

They do not obviously resemble a typical leafless [[cactus]] such as an ''[[Echinocactus]]''.

Some [[euphorbia]]s have leafless, rounded bodies adapted to water conservation similar to those of globular cacti, but characters such as the structure of their flowers make it clear that the two groups are not closely related. The [[Cladistics|cladistic method]] takes a systematic approach to characters, distinguishing between those that carry no information about shared evolutionary history \u2013 such as those evolved separately in different groups ([[homoplasies]]) or those left over from ancestors ([[plesiomorphies]]) \u2013 and derived characters, which have been passed down from innovations in a shared ancestor ([[apomorphies]]). Only derived characters, such as the spine-producing areoles of cacti, provide evidence for descent from a common ancestor. The results of cladistic analyses are expressed as [[cladogram]]s: tree-like diagrams showing the pattern of evolutionary branching and descent.{{sfn|Mauseth|2012|pp = 442\u2013450}}\n\nFrom the 1990s onwards, the predominant approach to constructing phylogenies for living plants has been [[molecular phylogenetics]], which uses molecular characters, particularly [[DNA]] sequences, rather than morphological characters like the presence or absence of spines and areoles. The difference is that the genetic code itself is used to decide evolutionary relationships, instead of being used indirectly via the characters it gives rise to. [[Clive A. Stace|Clive Stace]] describes this as having \"direct access to the genetic basis of evolution.\"{{sfn|Stace|2010a|p = 104}} As a simple example, prior to the use of genetic evidence, fungi were thought either to be plants or to be more closely related to plants than animals.

Medieval [[physic garden]]s, often attached to [[Monastery|monasteries]], contained plants of medical importance. They were forerunners of the first [[botanical garden]]s attached to [[University|universities]], founded from the 1540s onwards. One of the earliest was the [[Orto botanico di Padova|Padua botanical garden]]. These gardens facilitated the academic study of plants. Efforts to catalogue and describe their collections were the beginnings of [[plant taxonomy]], and led in 1753 to the [[binomial nomenclature|binomial system]] of [[Carl Linnaeus]] that remains in use to this day.\n\nIn the 19th and 20th centuries, new techniques were developed for the study of plants, including methods of [[optical microscope|optical microscopy]] and [[live cell imaging]], [[electron microscopy]], analysis of [[ploidy|chromosome number]], [[phytochemistry|plant chemistry]] and the structure and function of [[enzyme]]s and other [[protein]]s. In the last two decades of the 20th century, botanists exploited the techniques of [[molecular biology|molecular genetic analysis]], including [[genomics]] and [[proteomics]] and [[DNA sequences]] to classify plants more accurately.\n\nModern botany is a broad, multidisciplinary subject with inputs from most other areas of science and technology. Research topics include the study of plant [[Plant morphology|structure]], [[cell growth|growth]] and differentiation, [[Plant reproduction|reproduction]], [[plant physiology#Biochemistry of plants|biochemistry]] and [[metabolism|primary metabolism]], [[phytochemistry|chemical products]], [[Plant morphology#Development|development]], [[plant pathology|diseases]], [[phylogenetics|evolutionary relationships]], [[systematics]], and [[Taxonomy (biology)|plant taxonomy]]. Dominant themes in 21st century plant science are [[molecular genetics]] and [[epigenetics]], which are the mechanisms and control of gene expression during differentiation of [[plant cell]]s and [[Tissue (biology)#Plant tissues|tissues]]. Botanical research has diverse applications in providing [[staple foods]], materials such as [[Lumber|timber]], [[oil]], rubber, [[Fiber|fibre]] and drugs, in modern [[horticulture]], [[agriculture]] and [[forestry]], [[plant propagation]], [[Plant breeding|breeding]] and [[genetic modification]], in the synthesis of chemicals and raw materials for construction and energy production, in [[environmental management]], and the maintenance of [[biodiversity]].\n\n== History ==\n{{Main|History of botany}}\n\n=== Early botany ===\n[[File:Cork Micrographia Hooke.png|thumb|alt=engraving of cork cells from Hooke's Micrographia, 1665|An engraving of the cells of [[Cork oak|cork]], from [[Robert Hooke]]'s ''[[Micrographia]]'', 1665]]\n\nBotany originated as [[herbalism]], the study and use of plants for their medicinal properties.{{sfn|Sumner|2000|p = 16}} Many records of the [[Holocene]] period date early botanical knowledge as far back as 10,000 years ago.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Delcourt|first=Paul A.|last2=Delcourt|first2=Hazel R.|last3=Cridlebaugh|first3=Patricia A.|last4=Chapman|first4=Jefferson|date=1986-05-01|title=Holocene ethnobotanical and paleoecological record of human impact on vegetation in the Little Tennessee River Valley, Tennessee|url= |journal=Quaternary Research|volume=25|issue=3|pages=330\u2013349|doi=10.1016/0033-5894(86)90005-0|bibcode=1986QuRes..25..330D}}</ref> This early unrecorded knowledge of plants was discovered in ancient sites of human occupation within [[Tennessee]], which make up much of the [[Cherokee]] land today.<ref name=\":0\" /> The early recorded history of botany includes many ancient writings and plant classifications.

In the early 13th century, Abu al-Abbas al-Nabati, and [[Ibn al-Baitar]] (d. 1248) wrote on botany in a systematic and scientific manner.{{sfn|Dallal|2010|p = 197}}{{sfn|Panaino|2002|p = 93}}{{sfn|Levey|1973|p = 116}}\n\nIn the mid-16th century, \"[[botanical garden]]s\" were founded in a number of Italian universities \u2013 the [[Orto botanico di Padova|Padua botanical garden]] in 1545 is usually considered to be the first which is still in its original location. These gardens continued the practical value of earlier \"physic gardens\", often associated with monasteries, in which plants were cultivated for medical use. They supported the growth of botany as an academic subject. Lectures were given about the plants grown in the gardens and their medical uses demonstrated. Botanical gardens came much later to northern Europe; the first in England was the [[University of Oxford Botanic Garden]] in 1621. Throughout this period, botany remained firmly subordinate to medicine.{{sfn|Hill|1915}}\n\nGerman physician [[Leonhart Fuchs]] (1501\u20131566) was one of \"the three German fathers of botany\", along with theologian [[Otto Brunfels]] (1489\u20131534) and physician [[Hieronymus Bock]] (1498\u20131554) (also called Hieronymus Tragus).{{sfn|National Museum of Wales|2007}}{{sfn|Yaniv|Bachrach|2005|p = 157}} Fuchs and Brunfels broke away from the tradition of copying earlier works to make original observations of their own. Bock created his own system of plant classification.\n\nPhysician [[Valerius Cordus]] (1515\u20131544) authored a botanically and pharmacologically important herbal ''Historia Plantarum'' in 1544 and a [[pharmacopoeia]] of lasting importance, the ''Dispensatorium'' in 1546.{{sfn|Sprague|1939}} Naturalist [[Conrad von Gesner]] (1516\u20131565) and herbalist [[John Gerard]] (1545\u2013c. 1611) published herbals covering the medicinal uses of plants. Naturalist [[Ulisse Aldrovandi]] (1522\u20131605) was considered the ''father of natural history'', which included the study of plants. In 1665, using an early microscope, [[Polymath]] [[Robert Hooke]] discovered [[cell (biology)|cells]], a term he coined, in [[cork (material)|cork]], and a short time later in living plant tissue.{{sfn|Waggoner|2001}}\n\n=== Early modern botany ===\n{{Further|Taxonomy (biology)#History of taxonomy}}\n[[File:CarlvonLinne Garden.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Photograph of a garden|The [[Linnaean Garden]] of Linnaeus' residence in Uppsala, Sweden, was planted according to his ''Systema sexuale''.]]\n\nDuring the 18th century, systems of [[plant identification]] were developed comparable to [[single access key|dichotomous keys]], where unidentified plants are placed into [[taxon]]omic groups (e.g. family, genus and species) by making a series of choices between pairs of [[Character (biology)|characters]]. The choice and sequence of the characters may be artificial in keys designed purely for identification ([[single access key#Diagnostic ('artificial') versus synoptic ('natural') keys|diagnostic keys]]) or more closely related to the natural or [[taxonomic order|phyletic order]] of the [[taxon|taxa]] in synoptic keys.{{sfn|Scharf|2009|pp = 73\u2013117}} By the 18th century, new plants for study were arriving in Europe in increasing numbers from newly discovered countries and the European colonies worldwide. In 1753, [[Carl Linnaeus|Carl von Linn\u00e9]] (Carl Linnaeus) published his [[Species Plantarum]], a hierarchical classification of plant species that remains the reference point for [[International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants|modern botanical nomenclature]]. This established a standardised binomial or two-part naming scheme where the first name represented the [[genus]] and the second identified the [[species]] within the genus.{{sfn|Capon|2005|pp = 220\u2013223}} For the purposes of identification, Linnaeus's ''Systema Sexuale'' [[Linnaean taxonomy#Classification for plants|classified]] plants into 24 groups according to the number of their male sexual organs. The 24th group, ''Cryptogamia'', included all plants with concealed reproductive parts, mosses, liverworts, ferns, algae and fungi.{{sfn|Hoek|Mann|Jahns|2005|p = 9}}\n\nIncreasing knowledge of [[plant anatomy]], [[plant morphology|morphology]] and life cycles led to the realisation that there were more natural affinities between plants than the artificial sexual system of Linnaeus. [[Michel Adanson|Adanson]] (1763), [[Antoine Laurent de Jussieu|de Jussieu]] (1789), and [[Augustin Pyramus de Candolle|Candolle]] (1819) all proposed various alternative natural systems of classification that grouped plants using a wider range of shared characters and were widely followed. The [[Candollean system]] reflected his ideas of the progression of morphological complexity and the [[Bentham & Hooker system|later classification]] by [[George Bentham|Bentham]] and [[J.D. Hooker|Hooker]], which was influential until the mid-19th century, was influenced by Candolle's approach. [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]]'s publication of the ''[[On the Origin of Species|Origin of Species]]'' in 1859 and his concept of common descent required modifications to the Candollean system to reflect evolutionary relationships as distinct from mere morphological similarity.{{sfn|Starr|2009|pp =299\u2013}}\n\nBotany was greatly stimulated by the appearance of the first \"modern\" textbook, [[Matthias Jakob Schleiden|Matthias Schleiden]]'s ''{{lang|de|Grundz\u00fcge der Wissenschaftlichen Botanik}}'', published in English in 1849 as ''Principles of Scientific Botany''.{{sfn|Morton|1981|p = 377}}  Schleiden was a microscopist and an early plant anatomist who co-founded the [[cell theory]] with [[Theodor Schwann]] and [[Rudolf Virchow]] and was among the first to grasp the significance of the [[cell nucleus]] that had been described by [[Robert Brown (botanist, born 1773)|Robert Brown]] in 1831.{{sfn|Harris|2000|pp = 76\u201381}}\nIn 1855, [[Adolf Fick]] formulated [[Fick's laws of diffusion|Fick's laws]] that enabled the calculation of the rates of [[molecular diffusion]] in biological systems.{{sfn|Small|2012|pp =118\u2013}}\n\n[[File:Echeveria glauca II.jpg|thumb|''Echeveria glauca'' in a Connecticut greenhouse.

The concept that the composition of plant communities such as [[Temperate broadleaf and mixed forests|temperate broadleaf forest]] changes by a process of [[ecological succession]] was developed by [[Henry Chandler Cowles]], [[Arthur Tansley]] and [[Frederic Clements]]. Clements is credited with the idea of [[climax vegetation]] as the most complex vegetation that an environment can support and Tansley introduced the concept of [[ecosystem]]s to biology.{{sfn|Tansley|1935|pp=299\u2013302}}{{sfn|Willis|1997||pp=267\u2013271}}{{sfn|Morton|1981|p = 457}} Building on the extensive earlier work of [[Alphonse Pyramus de Candolle|Alphonse de Candolle]], [[Nikolai Ivanovich Vavilov|Nikolai Vavilov]] (1887\u20131943) produced accounts of the [[biogeography]], [[Center of origin|centres of origin]], and evolutionary history of economic plants.{{sfn|de Candolle|2006|pp = 9\u201325, 450\u2013465}}\n\nParticularly since the mid-1960s there have been advances in understanding of the physics of [[Plant physiology|plant physiological]] processes such as [[transpiration]] (the transport of water within plant tissues),  the temperature dependence of rates of water [[evaporation]] from the leaf surface and the [[molecular diffusion]] of water vapour and carbon dioxide through [[stomatal]] apertures.

These technologies enable the biotechnological use of whole plants or plant cell cultures grown in [[bioreactors]] to synthesise [[Bt corn|pesticides]], [[Biopharmaceutics|antibiotics]] or other [[pharming (genetics)|pharmaceuticals]], as well as the practical application of [[genetically modified crops]] designed for traits such as improved yield.{{sfn|Leonelli|Charnley|Webb|Bastow|2012}}\n\nModern morphology recognises a continuum between the major morphological categories of root, stem (caulome), leaf (phyllome) and [[trichome]].{{sfn|Sattler|Jeune|1992|pp = 249\u2013262}} Furthermore, it emphasises structural dynamics.{{sfn|Sattler|1992|pp = 708\u2013714}} Modern systematics aims to reflect and discover [[Phylogenetic nomenclature|phylogenetic relationships]] between plants.{{sfn|Ereshefsky|1997|pp = 493\u2013519}}{{sfn|Gray|Sargent|1889|pp = 292\u2013293}}{{sfn|Medbury|1993|pp = 14\u201316}}{{sfn|Judd|Campbell|Kellogg|Stevens|2002|pp = 347\u2013350}} Modern [[Molecular phylogenetics]] largely ignores morphological characters, relying on DNA sequences as data.

Biological classification is the method by which botanists group organisms into categories such as [[genus|genera]] or [[species]].

While scientists do not always agree on how to classify organisms, [[molecular phylogenetics]], which uses [[DNA sequences]] as data, has driven many recent revisions along evolutionary lines and is likely to continue to do so. The dominant classification system is called [[Linnaean taxonomy]]. It includes ranks and [[binomial nomenclature]]. The nomenclature of botanical organisms is codified in the [[International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants]] (ICN) and administered by the [[International Botanical Congress]].{{sfn|McNeill|Barrie|Buck|Demoulin|2011|p = Preamble, para. 7}}{{sfn|Mauseth|2003|pp = 528\u2013551}}\n\n[[Kingdom (biology)|Kingdom]] [[Plant]]ae belongs to [[Domain (biology)|Domain]] [[Eukarya]] and is broken down recursively until each species is separately classified.

The scientific name of a plant represents its genus and its species within the genus, resulting in a single worldwide name for each organism.{{sfn|Mauseth|2003|pp = 528\u2013551}} For example, the tiger lily is ''[[Lilium columbianum]]''. ''Lilium'' is the genus, and ''columbianum'' the [[Botanical name#Binary name|specific epithet]]. The combination is the name of the species. When writing the scientific name of an organism, it is proper to capitalise the first letter in the genus and put all of the specific epithet in lowercase. Additionally, the entire term is ordinarily italicised (or underlined when italics are not available).{{sfn|Mauseth|2003|pp = 528\u2013555}}{{sfn|International Association for Plant Taxonomy|2006}}{{sfn|Silyn-Roberts|2000|p = 198}}\n\nThe evolutionary relationships and heredity of a group of organisms is called its [[Phylogenetics|phylogeny]].

They do not obviously resemble a typical leafless [[cactus]] such as an ''[[Echinocactus]]''. However, both ''Pereskia'' and ''Echinocactus'' have spines produced from [[areoles]] (highly specialised pad-like structures) suggesting that the two genera are indeed related.{{sfn|Mauseth|2012|pp = 446\u2013449}}{{sfn|Anderson|2001|pp = 26\u201327}}\n\n{{Multiple image|float=right\n|title=Two cacti of very different appearance\n|total_width=400\n|width1=3872|height1=2592|image1=Pereskia aculeata5.jpg|caption1=''Pereskia aculeata''\n|width2=4288|height2=3216|image2=Bogarub-echinocactus-grusonii-1.jpg|caption2=''Echinocactus grusonii''\n|footer=Although ''Pereskia'' is a tree with leaves, it has spines and areoles like a more typical cactus, such as ''Echinocactus''.}}\nJudging relationships based on shared characters requires care, since plants may resemble one another through [[convergent evolution]] in which characters have arisen independently. Some [[euphorbia]]s have leafless, rounded bodies adapted to water conservation similar to those of globular cacti, but characters such as the structure of their flowers make it clear that the two groups are not closely related. The [[Cladistics|cladistic method]] takes a systematic approach to characters, distinguishing between those that carry no information about shared evolutionary history \u2013 such as those evolved separately in different groups ([[homoplasies]]) or those left over from ancestors ([[plesiomorphies]]) \u2013 and derived characters, which have been passed down from innovations in a shared ancestor ([[apomorphies]]). Only derived characters, such as the spine-producing areoles of cacti, provide evidence for descent from a common ancestor. The results of cladistic analyses are expressed as [[cladogram]]s: tree-like diagrams showing the pattern of evolutionary branching and descent.{{sfn|Mauseth|2012|pp = 442\u2013450}}\n\nFrom the 1990s onwards, the predominant approach to constructing phylogenies for living plants has been [[molecular phylogenetics]], which uses molecular characters, particularly [[DNA]] sequences, rather than morphological characters like the presence or absence of spines and areoles. The difference is that the genetic code itself is used to decide evolutionary relationships, instead of being used indirectly via the characters it gives rise to. [[Clive A. Stace|Clive Stace]] describes this as having \"direct access to the genetic basis of evolution.\"{{sfn|Stace|2010a|p = 104}} As a simple example, prior to the use of genetic evidence, fungi were thought either to be plants or to be more closely related to plants than animals.

Usually, the suffix is not stressed. When it is used with languages, however, it is stressed.\n\nIn Chechen, it is marked with the suffix ''-l''.

Count should not exceed 700 words. -->\nIn 1978, narcissistic, manipulative actress Madeline Ashton performs in an awful musical version of ''[[Sweet Bird of Youth]]'' on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]]. She invites long-time friend Helen Sharp, an aspiring writer, backstage along with Helen's fianc\u00e9, plastic surgeon Ernest Menville. Ernest is smitten with Madeline, and breaks off his engagement with Helen to marry her. Seven years later, Helen is obese, depressed and committed to a psychiatric hospital where she begins plotting revenge on Madeline.\n\nAnother seven years later, Madeline and Ernest live in Beverly Hills, but they are miserable: Madeline's acting career is declining and Ernest is an alcoholic reduced to working as a [[Embalming#Specialist embalming|reconstructive mortician]]. Receiving an invitation to a party celebrating Helen's new book, Madeline rushes to a spa where she regularly receives facial treatments. Understanding Madeline's situation, the spa owner gives her the business card of Lisle Von Rhuman, a mysterious, glamorous, wealthy socialite specializing in youth rejuvenation.\n\nMadeline and Ernest attend the party for Helen's novel, ''Forever Young'', and discover that somehow, Helen is slim, youthful, and beautiful. Dumbfounded and depressed by Helen's appearance, and upon secretly witnessing Helen tell Ernest that she blames her for his career decline, Madeline visits her young lover, but discovers he is with a woman his age. Dejected, Madeline drives to Lisle's home. Lisle, claiming to be 71, but looking decades younger, reveals the secret of her beauty and youth\u2014an expensive [[Elixir of life|potion that promises eternal life and an everlasting youthful appearance]]. Madeline purchases and drinks the potion and is rejuvenated, regaining her beauty. As a condition of purchase, Lisle warns Madeline to disappear from public life after ten years to keep the existence of the potion secret, and to take good care of her body.\n\nHelen seduces Ernest and convinces him to kill Madeline. When Madeline returns home, she and Ernest argue, during which she falls down the stairs, breaking her neck. Believing Madeline dead, Ernest phones Helen for advice, initially not seeing Madeline stand and approach him with her head twisted backward. At Madeline's request, Ernest drives her to the emergency room. Madeline is told she is technically dead, and faints. She is taken to the [[morgue]] due to her body having no pulse and a temperature below 80&nbsp;\u00b0F. After rescuing Madeline, Ernest considers her resurrection a miracle and uses his skills as a mortician to repair her body at home.\n\nHelen demands information about Madeline's situation. Overhearing Helen and Ernest discussing their plot to kill her, Madeline shoots Helen with a shotgun. Although the blast creates a hole in her abdomen, Helen survives, revealing that she drank the same potion. The two briefly fight before apologizing and reconciling their friendship. Fed up with the pair, Ernest prepares to leave, but Helen and Madeline convince him to do one last repair on their bodies. They realize they will need regular maintenance and scheme to have Ernest drink the potion to ensure he will always be available.\n\nAfter bringing Ernest to Lisle, she offers to give him the potion free of charge in exchange for his surgical skills. Ernest refuses to drink it when he realizes the pitfalls of immortality. He pockets the potion and flees, but becomes trapped on the roof. Helen and Madeline implore Ernest to drink the potion to survive an impending fall. Ernest, realizing that they only need him for their own selfish reasons, refuses and drops the potion to the ground, but after falling he lands in Lisle's pool and escapes. Lisle banishes Madeline and Helen from her group, leaving the pair to rely on each other for companionship and maintenance.\n\nThirty-seven years later, Madeline and Helen attend Ernest's funeral, where he is eulogized as having lived an adventurous and fulfilling life with a large family and friends. The two women are parodies of their former selves, with cracked, peeling paint and putty covering most of their grey and rotting flesh. Helen trips at the top of a staircase. When Madeline hesitates to help her, Helen grabs Madeline and the two tumble down the stairs, breaking to pieces. As their disembodied heads totter down together, Helen sardonically asks Madeline where she parked their car.\n<!-- Please review [[WP:FILMPLOT]] before adding text.

The film received mixed reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $149 million worldwide. It has developed a strong [[cult following]], particularly among the [[LGBT]] community.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Please review [[WP:FILMPLOT]] before adding text. Count should not exceed 700 words. -->\nIn 1978, narcissistic, manipulative actress Madeline Ashton performs in an awful musical version of ''[[Sweet Bird of Youth]]'' on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]]. She invites long-time friend Helen Sharp, an aspiring writer, backstage along with Helen's fianc\u00e9, plastic surgeon Ernest Menville. Ernest is smitten with Madeline, and breaks off his engagement with Helen to marry her. Seven years later, Helen is obese, depressed and committed to a psychiatric hospital where she begins plotting revenge on Madeline.\n\nAnother seven years later, Madeline and Ernest live in Beverly Hills, but they are miserable: Madeline's acting career is declining and Ernest is an alcoholic reduced to working as a [[Embalming#Specialist embalming|reconstructive mortician]]. Receiving an invitation to a party celebrating Helen's new book, Madeline rushes to a spa where she regularly receives facial treatments. Understanding Madeline's situation, the spa owner gives her the business card of Lisle Von Rhuman, a mysterious, glamorous, wealthy socialite specializing in youth rejuvenation.\n\nMadeline and Ernest attend the party for Helen's novel, ''Forever Young'', and discover that somehow, Helen is slim, youthful, and beautiful. Dumbfounded and depressed by Helen's appearance, and upon secretly witnessing Helen tell Ernest that she blames her for his career decline, Madeline visits her young lover, but discovers he is with a woman his age. Dejected, Madeline drives to Lisle's home. Lisle, claiming to be 71, but looking decades younger, reveals the secret of her beauty and youth\u2014an expensive [[Elixir of life|potion that promises eternal life and an everlasting youthful appearance]]. Madeline purchases and drinks the potion and is rejuvenated, regaining her beauty. As a condition of purchase, Lisle warns Madeline to disappear from public life after ten years to keep the existence of the potion secret, and to take good care of her body.\n\nHelen seduces Ernest and convinces him to kill Madeline. When Madeline returns home, she and Ernest argue, during which she falls down the stairs, breaking her neck. Believing Madeline dead, Ernest phones Helen for advice, initially not seeing Madeline stand and approach him with her head twisted backward. At Madeline's request, Ernest drives her to the emergency room. Madeline is told she is technically dead, and faints. She is taken to the [[morgue]] due to her body having no pulse and a temperature below 80\u00b0 F. After rescuing Madeline, Ernest considers her resurrection a miracle and uses his skills as a mortician to repair her body at home.\n\nHelen demands information about Madeline's situation. Overhearing Helen and Ernest discussing their plot to kill her, Madeline shoots Helen with a shotgun. Although the blast creates a hole in her abdomen, Helen survives, revealing that she drank the same potion. The two briefly fight before apologizing and reconciling their friendship. Fed up with the pair, Ernest prepares to leave, but Helen and Madeline convince him to do one last repair on their bodies. They realize they will need regular maintenance and scheme to have Ernest drink the potion to ensure he will always be available.\n\nAfter bringing Ernest to Lisle, she offers to give him the potion free of charge in exchange for his surgical skills. Ernest refuses to drink it when he realizes the pitfalls of immortality. He pockets the potion and flees, but becomes trapped on the roof. Helen and Madeline implore Ernest to drink the potion to survive an impending fall. Ernest, realizing that they only need him for their own selfish reasons, refuses and drops the potion to the ground, but after falling he lands in Lisle's pool and escapes. Lisle banishes Madeline and Helen from her group, leaving the pair to rely on each other for companionship and maintenance.\n\nThirty-seven years later, Madeline and Helen attend Ernest's funeral, where he is eulogized as having lived an adventurous and fulfilling life with a large family and friends. The two women are parodies of their former selves, with cracked, peeling paint and putty covering most of their grey and rotting flesh. Helen trips at the top of a staircase. When Madeline hesitates to help her, Helen grabs Madeline and the two tumble down the stairs, breaking to pieces. As their disembodied heads totter down together, Helen sardonically asks Madeline where she parked their car.\n<!-- Please review [[WP:FILMPLOT]] before adding text.

In outcrossing, unless there is verifiable genetic information, one may find that all individuals are distantly related to an ancient progenitor. If the trait carries throughout a population, all individuals can have this trait. This is called the [[founder effect]]. In the well established breeds, that are commonly bred, a large gene pool is present. For example, in 2004, over 18,000 Persian cats were registered.<ref>[http://www.petplace.com/cats/top-cat-breeds-for-2004/page1.aspx Top Cat Breeds for 2004]. Petplace.com. Retrieved on 2013-03-05.</ref> A possibility exists for a complete outcross, if no barriers exist between the individuals to breed. However, it is not always the case, and a form of distant linebreeding occurs. Again it is up to the assortative breeder to know what sort of traits, both positive and negative, exist within the diversity of one breeding. This diversity of genetic expression, within even close relatives, increases the variability and diversity of viable stock.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20110616235259/http://www.bulldoginformation.com/breeding-quality.html Preserving Quality and Genetic Diversity in a Dog Breed]. bulldoginformation.com</ref>\n\n===Laboratory animals===\nSystematic inbreeding and maintenance of inbred strains of [[laboratory mice]] and rats is of great importance for biomedical research. The inbreeding guarantees a consistent and uniform [[animal model]] for experimental purposes and enables genetic studies in [[congenic]] and knock-out animals. In order to achieve a mouse strain that is considered inbred, a minimum of 20 sequential generations of sibling matings must occur. With each successive generation of breeding, homozygosity in the entire genome increases, eliminating heterozygous loci. With 20 generations of sibling matings, homozygosity is occurring at roughly 98.7% of all loci in the genome, allowing for these offspring to serve as animal models for genetic studies.<ref>Taft, Robert et al. \u201cKnow thy mouse.\u201d Science Direct.

Specifically, written documents such as the Bible illustrate that there have been laws and social customs that have called for the abstention from inbreeding.  Along with cultural taboos, parental education and awareness of inbreeding consequences have played large roles in minimizing inbreeding frequencies in areas like Europe.  That being so, there are less urbanized and less populated regions across the world that have shown continuity in the practice of inbreeding.\n\nThe continuity of inbreeding is often either by choice or unavoidably due to the limitations of the geographical area. When by choice, the rate of consanguinity is highly dependent on religion and culture.<ref name=\"Tadmouri 2009\" /> In the Western world some [[Anabaptism|Anabaptist]] groups are highly inbred because they originate from small founder populations and until{{Clarify|date=August 2019}} today{{When|date=August 2019}} marriage outside the groups is not allowed for members.{{cn|date=June 2019}}  Especially the [[Reidenbach Old Order Mennonites]]<ref>Karsten-Gerhard Albertsen: ''The History & Life of the Reidenbach Mennonites (Thirty Fivers)''.

The same is true for some [[Hasidic]] and [[Haredi Judaism|Haredi Jewish]] groups.\n\nOf the practicing regions, Middle Eastern and northern Africa territories show the greatest frequencies of consanguinity. <ref name=\"Tadmouri 2009\" />  The link between the high frequency and the region is primarily due to the dominance of Islamic populations, who have historically engaged in familyline relations.<ref name=\"Bittles 2010\" />\n\nAmong these populations with high levels of inbreeding, researchers have found several disorders prevalent among inbred offspring.  In [[Lebanon]], [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Egypt]], and in [[Israel]], the offspring of consanguineous relationships have an increased risk of congenital malformations, congenital heart defects, congenital [[hydrocephalus]] and [[neural tube defect]]s.<ref name=\"Tadmouri 2009\" />  Furthermore, among inbred children in [[State of Palestine|Palestine]] and Lebanon, there is a positive association between consanguinity and reported [[Cleft palate|cleft lip/palate]] cases.<ref name=\"Tadmouri 2009\" />  Historically, populations of [[Qatar]] have engaged in consanguineous relationships of all kinds, leading to high risk of inheriting genetic diseases.

Over time, due to the relatively limited number of potential consorts, the [[gene pool]] of many ruling families grew progressively smaller, until all European royalty was related.

For each homozygous recessive individual formed there is an equal chance of producing a homozygous dominant individual \u2014 one completely devoid of the harmful allele. Contrary to common belief, inbreeding does not in itself alter allele frequencies, but rather increases the relative proportion of homozygotes to heterozygotes; however, because the increased proportion of deleterious homozygotes exposes the allele to [[natural selection]], in the long run its frequency decreases more rapidly in inbred populations.

With persistent inbreeding, there is evidence that shows that inbreeding depression becomes less severe. This is associated with the unmasking and elimination of severely deleterious recessive alleles. However, inbreeding depression is not a temporary phenomenon because this elimination of deleterious recessive alleles will never be complete.

In outcrossing, unless there is verifiable genetic information, one may find that all individuals are distantly related to an ancient progenitor. If the trait carries throughout a population, all individuals can have this trait. This is called the [[founder effect]]. In the well established breeds, that are commonly bred, a large gene pool is present. For example, in 2004, over 18,000 Persian cats were registered.<ref>[http://www.petplace.com/cats/top-cat-breeds-for-2004/page1.aspx Top Cat Breeds for 2004]. Petplace.com. Retrieved on 2013-03-05.</ref> A possibility exists for a complete outcross, if no barriers exist between the individuals to breed. However, it is not always the case, and a form of distant linebreeding occurs. Again it is up to the assortative breeder to know what sort of traits, both positive and negative, exist within the diversity of one breeding. This diversity of genetic expression, within even close relatives, increases the variability and diversity of viable stock.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20110616235259/http://www.bulldoginformation.com/breeding-quality.html Preserving Quality and Genetic Diversity in a Dog Breed]. bulldoginformation.com</ref>\n\n===Laboratory animals===\nSystematic inbreeding and maintenance of inbred strains of [[laboratory mice]] and rats is of great importance for biomedical research. The inbreeding guarantees a consistent and uniform [[animal model]] for experimental purposes and enables genetic studies in [[congenic]] and knock-out animals. In order to achieve a mouse strain that is considered inbred, a minimum of 20 sequential generations of sibling matings must occur. With each successive generation of breeding, homozygosity in the entire genome increases, eliminating heterozygous loci. With 20 generations of sibling matings, homozygosity is occurring at roughly 98.7% of all loci in the genome, allowing for these offspring to serve as animal models for genetic studies.<ref>Taft, Robert et al. \u201cKnow thy mouse.\u201d Science Direct.

Specifically, written documents such as the Bible illustrate that there have been laws and social customs that have called for the abstention from inbreeding.  Along with cultural taboos, parental education and awareness of inbreeding consequences have played large roles in minimizing inbreeding frequencies in areas like Europe.  That being so, there are less urbanized and less populated regions across the world that have shown continuity in the practice of inbreeding.\n\nThe continuity of inbreeding is often either by choice or unavoidably due to the limitations of the geographical area. When by choice, the rate of consanguinity is highly dependent on religion and culture.<ref name=\"Tadmouri 2009\" /> In the Western world some [[Anabaptism|Anabaptist]] groups are highly inbred because they originate from small founder populations and until{{Clarify|date=August 2019}} today{{When|date=August 2019}} marriage outside the groups is not allowed for members.{{cn|date=June 2019}}  Especially the [[Reidenbach Old Order Mennonites]]<ref>Karsten-Gerhard Albertsen: ''The History & Life of the Reidenbach Mennonites (Thirty Fivers)''.

The same is true for some [[Hasidic]] and [[Haredi Judaism|Haredi Jewish]] groups.\n\nOf the practicing regions, Middle Eastern and northern Africa territories show the greatest frequencies of consanguinity. <ref name=\"Tadmouri 2009\" />  The link between the high frequency and the region is primarily due to the dominance of Islamic populations, who have historically engaged in familyline relations.<ref name=\"Bittles 2010\" />\n\nAmong these populations with high levels of inbreeding, researchers have found several disorders prevalent among inbred offspring.  In [[Lebanon]], [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Egypt]], and in [[Israel]], the offspring of consanguineous relationships have an increased risk of congenital malformations, congenital heart defects, congenital [[hydrocephalus]] and [[neural tube defect]]s.<ref name=\"Tadmouri 2009\" />  Furthermore, among inbred children in [[State of Palestine|Palestine]] and Lebanon, there is a positive association between consanguinity and reported [[Cleft palate|cleft lip/palate]] cases.<ref name=\"Tadmouri 2009\" />  Historically, populations of [[Qatar]] have engaged in consanguineous relationships of all kinds, leading to high risk of inheriting genetic diseases.  As of 2014, around 5% of the Qatari population suffered from hereditary hearing loss; most were descendants of a consanguineous relationship.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Girotto G, Mezzavilla M, Abdulhadi K, Vuckovic D, Vozzi D, Khalifa Alkowari M, Gasparini P, Badii R | title = Consanguinity and hereditary hearing loss in Qatar | journal = Human Heredity | volume = 77 | issue = 1\u20134 | pages = 175\u201382 | date = 2014-01-01 | pmid = 25060281 | doi = 10.1159/000360475 | doi-access = free }}</ref>\n\n===Royalty and nobility===\n[[File:Anuk.PNG|thumb|[[Tutankhamun]] ({{c.}} 1341\u20131323 BC) (receiving flowers from [[Ankhesenamun]]).

These ties were often sealed only upon the birth of progeny within the [[arranged marriage]]. Thus marriage was seen as a union of lines of nobility, not as a contract between individuals as it is seen today.\n\n[[Royal intermarriage]] was often practiced among European royal families, usually for interests of state. Over time, due to the relatively limited number of potential consorts, the [[gene pool]] of many ruling families grew progressively smaller, until all European royalty was related. This also resulted in many being descended from a certain person through many lines of descent, such as the numerous European royalty and nobility descended from the British [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]] or [[King Christian IX of Denmark]].<ref name=\"beechegotha1\">{{cite book | title=The Gotha: Still a Continental Royal Family, Vol. 1 | publisher=Kensington House Books | last = Beeche | first = Arturo | name-list-format = vanc | year=2009 | location=Richmond, US | pages=1\u201313 | isbn=978-0-9771961-7-3}}</ref> The House of [[Habsburg]] was infamous for its inbreeding, with the [[Prognathism|Habsburg lip]] cited as an ill-effect, although no genetic evidence has proved the claim.
