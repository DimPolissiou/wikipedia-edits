[[Religion]]s with a [[philosophy of history#Cyclical and linear history|linear]] [[divinity|divine]] history often depict hells as eternal destinations, the biggest examples of which are [[Christianity]] and [[Islam]], whereas religions with [[reincarnation]] usually depict a hell as an intermediary period between [[incarnation]]s, as is the case in the [[dharmic religions]]. Religions typically locate hell in another dimension or under [[Earth]]'s surface. Other afterlife destinations include [[Heaven]], [[Paradise]], [[Purgatory]], [[Limbo]], and [[the underworld]].\n\nOther religions, which do not conceive of the afterlife as a place of punishment or reward, merely describe an abode of the dead, the [[grave]], a neutral place that is located under the surface of Earth (for example, see [[Kur]], [[Hades]], and [[Sheol]]). Such places are sometimes equated with the English word 'hell', though a more correct translation would be 'underworld' or 'world of the dead'. The ancient Mesopotamian, Greek, Roman, and Finnic religions include entrances to the underworld from the land of the living.\n\n==Overview==\n===Etymology===\n[[File:Hel (1889) by Johannes Gehrts.jpg|thumb|''Hel'' (1889) by [[Johannes Gehrts]], depicts the Old Norse [[Hel (being)|Hel]], a goddess-like figure, in the [[Hel (location)|location of the same name]], which she oversees]]\nThe modern English word ''hell'' is derived from Old English ''hel'', ''helle'' (first attested around 725 AD to refer to a nether world of the dead) reaching into the [[Anglo-Saxon paganism|Anglo-Saxon pagan period]].<ref name=BARNHART348>[[Robert Barnhart|Barnhart, Robert K.]] (1995) ''The Barnhart Concise Dictionary of Etymology'', page 348. [[Harper Collins]] {{ISBN|0-06-270084-7}}</ref> The word has [[cognate]]s in all branches of the [[Germanic languages]], including Old Norse ''hel'' (which refers to both a [[Hel (location)|location]] and [[Hel (being)|goddess-like being]] in [[Norse mythology]]), [[Old Frisian]] ''helle'', [[Old Saxon]] ''hellia'', [[Old High German]] ''hella'', and [[Gothic language|Gothic]] ''halja''. All forms ultimately derive from the [[Linguistic reconstruction|reconstructed]] [[Proto-Germanic]] feminine noun *''xalj\u014d'' or *''halj\u014d'' ('concealed place, the underworld'). In turn, the Proto-Germanic form derives from the [[Indo-European ablaut|o-grade form]] of the [[Proto-Indo-European root]] *''kel-'', *''kol''-: 'to cover, conceal, save'.<ref name=\"HEL-NOUN\">For discussion and analysis, see Orel (2003:156) and Watkins (2000:38).</ref> Indo-European cognates including Latin ''c\u0113l\u0101re'' (\"to hide\", related to the English word ''cellar'') and early Irish ''ceilid'' (\"hides\"). Upon the Christianization of the Germanic peoples, extension of Proto-Germanic *''xalj\u014d'' were reinterpreted to denote the underworld in [[Christian mythology]],<ref name=BARNHART348/><ref>\"hell, n. and int.\" ''OED Online'', Oxford University Press, January 2018, www.oed.com/view/Entry/85636.

This form is reconstructed from the Latinized Gothic plural noun *''haliurunnae'' (attested by [[Jordanes]]; according to philologist [[Vladimir Orel]], meaning '[[witchcraft|witches]]'), Old English ''helle-r\u00fane'' ('sorceress, [[necromancer]]', according to Orel), and Old High German ''helli-r\u016bna'' 'magic'. The compound is composed of two elements: *''xalj\u014d'' (*''halj\u014d'') and *''r\u016bn\u014d'', the Proto-Germanic precursor to Modern English ''[[runic alphabet|rune]]''.<ref name=\"HELL-RUNE\">See discussion at Orel (2003:155\u2013156 & 310).</ref> The second element in the Gothic ''haliurunnae'' may however instead be an agent noun from the verb ''rinnan'' (\"to run, go\"), which would make its literal meaning \"one who travels to the netherworld\".<ref>Scardigli, Piergiuseppe, Die Goten: Sprache und Kultur (1973) pp. 70\u201371.</ref><ref>Lehmann, Winfred, A Gothic Etymological Dictionary (1986)</ref>\n\nProto-Germanic *''xalja-w\u012btjan'' (or *''halja-w\u012btjan'') is reconstructed from Old Norse ''hel-v\u00edti'' 'hell', Old English ''helle-w\u00edte'' 'hell-torment, hell', Old Saxon ''helli-w\u012bti'' 'hell', and the Middle High German feminine noun ''helle-w\u012bze''. The compound is a compound of *''xalj\u014d'' (discussed above) and *''w\u012btjan'' (reconstructed from forms such as Old English ''witt'' 'right mind, wits', Old Saxon ''gewit'' 'understanding', and Gothic ''un-witi'' 'foolishness, understanding').<ref name=\"HELV\u00cdTI\">Orel (2003:156 & 464).</ref>\n\n===Religion, mythology, and folklore===\nHell appears in several [[mythology|mythologies]] and [[religion]]s. It is commonly inhabited by [[demon]]s and the [[soul]]s of dead people. A fable about Hell which recurs in [[folklore]] across several cultures is the [[allegory of the long spoons]]. Hell is often depicted in art and literature, perhaps most famously in [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]]'s ''[[Divine Comedy]]''.\n\n===Punishment===\n[[File:Fresque \u00e9glise huaro.JPG|thumb|240px|Preserved colonial wall painting of 1802 depicting the Hell,<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=A6nutjzmxvkC&pg=PA382&lpg=PA382&dq=historia+colonial+de+cusco#v=onepage&q=historia%20colonial%20de%20cusco&f=false|pp=106|title=The Colonial Andes: Tapestries and Silverwork, 1530\u20131830|author1=Elena Phipps|author2=Joanna Hecht|author3=Cristina Esteras Mart\u00edn|year=2004|publisher=[[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]|location=New York|isbn=030010491X}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Vpi5xwEACAAJ&dq=SEBASTI%C3%81N+L%C3%93PEZ,+Santiago.+El+barroco+iberoamericano+1990|title=El b\u00e1rroco iberoamericano.

Sometimes these distinctions are specific, with [[Damnation#Religious|damned]] souls suffering for each sin committed (see for example Plato's [[myth of Er]] or Dante's ''[[Divine Comedy|The Divine Comedy]]''), but sometimes they are general, with condemned sinners relegated to one or more chamber of Hell or to a level of suffering.\n\nIn many religious cultures, including Christianity and Islam, Hell is often depicted as fiery, painful, and harsh, inflicting suffering on the guilty. Despite these common depictions of Hell as a place of fire, some other traditions portray Hell as cold. Buddhist \u2013 and particularly Tibetan Buddhist \u2013 descriptions of Hell feature an equal number of hot and cold Hells. Among Christian descriptions [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]]'s ''[[Inferno (Dante)|Inferno]]'' portrays the innermost (9th) circle of Hell as a frozen lake of blood and guilt.<ref>{{cite book\n|last=Alighieri\n|first=Dante\n|authorlink=Dante Alighieri\n|others=trans.

II: ''Pangool'', Nouvelles \u00e9ditions africaines, [[Dakar]], 1990, pp 91\u2013128, {{ISBN|2-7236-1055-1}} (''Jaaniw'', variation: ''\"Jaaniiw\"'')</ref>\n\n===Native American===\n{{unreferenced section|date=October 2017}}\nThe hells of the Americas include the [[Aztec religion]]'s ''[[Mictlan]]'', [[Inuit religion]]'s ''[[Adlivun]]'', and the [[Yanomami]] religion's ''[[Shobari Waka]]''. In [[Mayan religion]], ''[[Xibalba]]'' (or ''Metnal'') is the dangerous underworld of nine levels. The road into and out of it is said to be steep, thorny and very forbidding. Ritual healers would intone healing prayers banishing diseases to ''Xibalba''. Much of the [[Popol Vuh]] describes the adventures of the [[Maya Hero Twins]] in their cunning struggle with the evil lords of ''Xibalba''.\n\nThe [[Aztec]]s believed that the dead traveled to ''Mictlan'', a neutral place found far to the north. There was also a legend of a place of white flowers, which was always dark, and was home to the gods of death, particularly Mictlantecutli and his spouse Mictlantecihuatl, which means literally \"lords of Mictlan\". The journey to ''Mictlan'' took four years, and the travelers had to overcome difficult tests, such as passing a mountain range where the mountains crashed into each other, a field where the wind carried flesh-scraping knives, and a river of blood with fearsome [[jaguar]]s.\n\n===Oceania===\n\nIn [[Religion in Fiji#Ancient religion|pre-Christian Fijian mythology]] there was belief in an underworld called [[Murimuria]].\n\n==Abrahamic religions==\nHell is conceived of in most Abrahamic religions as a place of, or a form of, [[punishment]].<ref>''Heart of Buddha, Heart of China: James Carter'' \u2013 2010, p 75</ref>\n\n===Judaism===\n{{See also|Gehenna|Sheol}}\nEarly Judaism had no concept of Hell, although the concept of an afterlife was introduced during the [[Hellenistic period]], apparently from neighboring [[Hellenistic religion]]s. It occurs for example in the [[Book of Daniel]]. Daniel 12:2 proclaims \"And many of those who sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake, Some to everlasting life, Some to shame and everlasting contempt.\"\n\n[[Judaism]] does not have a specific doctrine about the afterlife, but it does have a mystical/Orthodox tradition of describing [[Gehinnom]]. Gehinnom is not Hell, but originally a grave and in later times a sort of Purgatory where one is judged based on one's life's deeds, or rather, where one becomes fully aware of one's own shortcomings and negative actions during one's life. The [[Kabbalah]] explains it as a \"waiting room\" (commonly translated as an \"entry way\") for all souls (not just the wicked). The overwhelming majority of rabbinic thought maintains that people are not in Gehinnom forever; the longest that one can be there is said to be 12 months, however there has been the occasional noted exception. Some consider it a spiritual forge where the soul is purified for its eventual ascent to [[Jewish eschatology#The world to come|Olam Habah]] (''heb.'' \u05e2\u05d5\u05dc\u05dd \u05d4\u05d1\u05d0; ''lit.'' \"The world to come\", often viewed as analogous to heaven). This is also mentioned in the Kabbalah, where the soul is described as breaking, like the flame of a candle lighting another: the part of the soul that ascends being pure and the \"unfinished\" piece being reborn.\n\nAccording to Jewish teachings, hell is not entirely physical; rather, it can be compared to a very intense feeling of shame. People are ashamed of their misdeeds and this constitutes suffering which makes up for the bad deeds. When one has so deviated from the will of [[God in Judaism|God]], one is said to be in Gehinnom. This is not meant to refer to some point in the future, but to the very present moment. The gates of [[teshuva]] (return) are said to be always open, and so one can align his will with that of God at any moment. Being out of alignment with God's will is itself a punishment according to the [[Torah]].\n\nMany scholars of Jewish mysticism, particularly of the [[Kabbalah]], describe seven \"compartments\" or \"habitations\" of Hell, just as they describe seven divisions of [[Heaven]]. These divisions go by many different names, and the most frequently mentioned are as follows:<ref>(edit.) Boustan, Ra'anan S. Reed, Annette Yoshiko.

Conditional immortality is the belief that the soul dies with the body and does not live again until the resurrection. As with other Jewish writings of the [[Second Temple]] period, the New Testament text distinguishes two words, both translated \"Hell\" in older English Bibles: ''Hades'', \"the grave\", and ''Gehenna'' where God \"can destroy both body and soul\".<ref>{{cite web|title=4.9 Hell|url=http://www.christadelphians.com/biblebasics/0409hell.html|publisher=The Christadelphians|accessdate=6 August 2015}}</ref> A minority of Christians read this to mean that neither Hades nor Gehenna are eternal but refer to the ultimate destruction of the wicked in the Lake of Fire in a consuming fire after resurrection.

Therefore, [[annihilationism]] includes the doctrine that \"the wicked\" are also destroyed rather than [[tortured|tormented]] [[eternity|forever]] in traditional \"Hell\" or the [[lake of fire]]. Christian mortalism and annihilationism are directly related to the doctrine of conditional immortality, the idea that a human [[soul]] is not immortal unless it is given eternal life at the [[second coming of Christ]] and [[resurrection of the dead]].\n\nBiblical scholars looking at the issue through the Hebrew text have denied the teaching of innate immortality.<ref>{{Citation | quote = Many biblical scholars down throughout history, looking at the issue through Hebrew rather than Greek eyes, have denied the teaching of innate immortality. | last = Knight | title = A brief history of Seventh-Day Adventists | page = 42 | year = 1999}}</ref>{{Sfn | Pool | 1998 | p = 133 | ps =: 'Various concepts of conditional immortality or annihilationism have appeared earlier in Baptist history as well.

Seventh-day Adventists believe that [[death]] is a state of [[Soul sleep|unconscious sleep]] until the resurrection. They base this belief on biblical texts such as {{Bibleverse||Ecclesiastes|9:5|NIV}} which states \"the dead know nothing\", and {{Bibleverse|1|Thessalonians|4:13\u201318|NIV}} which contains a description of the dead being raised from the [[Grave (burial)|grave]] at the second coming. These verses, it is argued, indicate that death is only a period or form of slumber.\n\nAdventists teach that the resurrection of the righteous will take place shortly after the second coming of [[Jesus]], as described in Revelation 20:4\u20136 that follows Revelation 19:11\u201316, whereas the resurrection of the wicked will occur after the [[millennialism|millennium]], as described in Revelation 20:5 and 20:12\u201313 that follow Revelation 20:4 and 6\u20137, though Revelation 20:12\u201313 and 15 actually describe a ''mixture'' of saved and condemned people being raised from the dead and judged. Adventists reject the traditional doctrine of hell as a state of everlasting conscious torment, believing instead that the wicked will be permanently destroyed after the millennium by the [[lake of fire]], which is called 'the [[second death]]' in Revelation 20:14.\n\nThose Adventist doctrines about death and hell reflect an underlying belief in: (a) conditional immortality (or conditionalism), as opposed to the [[immortality]] of the [[soul]]; and (b) the [[christian anthropology|monistic nature]] of [[human beings]], in which the soul is not separable from the body, as opposed to [[bipartite (theology)|bipartite]] or [[tripartite (theology)|tripartite]] conceptions, in which the soul is separable.\n\n[[Jehovah's Witnesses]] hold that the soul ceases to exist when the person dies<ref name=\"bibleteach\">\"What Does the Bible Really Teach?\", 2005, Published by Jehovah's Witnesses</ref> and therefore that Hell (Sheol or Hades) is a state of non-existence.<ref name=\"bibleteach\" /> In their theology, Gehenna differs from Sheol or Hades in that it holds no hope of a resurrection.<ref name=\"bibleteach\" /> Tartarus is held to be the metaphorical state of debasement of the fallen angels between the time of their moral fall (Genesis chapter 6) until their post-millennial destruction along with Satan (Revelation chapter 20).<ref>\"Insight on the scriptures, Volume 2\", 1988, Published by Jehovah's Witnesses.</ref>\n\n[[Bible Student movement|Bible Students]] and [[Christadelphians]] also believe in annihilationism.\n\n[[Christian Universalism|Christian Universalists]] believe in [[universal reconciliation]], the belief that all human souls will be eventually reconciled with God and admitted to Heaven.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.auburn.edu/~allenkc/chr-univ.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-12-17 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171122135418/http://www.auburn.edu/~allenkc/chr-univ.html |archivedate=22 November 2017 }} What is Christian Universalism by Ken Allen Th.D</ref> This belief is held by some [[Unitarian Universalism|Unitarian-Universalists]].<ref>''New Bible Dictionary'', \"Hell\", InterVarsity Press, 1996.</ref><ref>''New Dictionary of Biblical Theology'', \"Hell\", InterVarsity Press, 2000.</ref><ref>[[Evangelical Alliance]] Commission on Truth and Unity Among Evangelicals, ''The Nature of Hell'', Paternoster, 2000.</ref>\n\nAccording to [[Emanuel Swedenborg]]'s [[Second Coming]] [[Christianity|Christian]] revelation, hell exists because evil people want it.<ref>Swedenborg, E.

In later Hindu literature, especially the law books and Puranas, more realms are mentioned, including a realm similar to Hell, called [[naraka]] (in Devan\u0101gar\u012b: \u0928\u0930\u0915). [[Yama]] as the first born human (together with his twin sister [[Yamuna in Hinduism|Yam\u012b]]), by virtue of precedence, becomes ruler of men and a judge on their departure. Originally he resides in Heaven, but later, especially medieval, traditions mention his court in naraka.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n\nIn the law-books (sm\u1e5btis and dharma-s\u016btras, like the Manu-sm\u1e5bti), naraka is a place of punishment for sins. It is a lower spiritual plane (called ''naraka-loka'') where the spirit is judged and the partial fruits of [[karma]] affect the next life. In [[Mahabharata]] there is a mention of the [[Pandavas]] and the [[Kauravas]] both going to Heaven. At first Yudhisthir goes to heaven where he sees Duryodhana enjoying heaven; Indra tells him that Duryodhana is in heaven as he did his Kshatriya duties. Then he shows Yudhisthir hell where it appears his brothers are. Later it is revealed that this was a test for Yudhisthir and that his brothers and the Kauravas are all in heaven and live happily in the divine abode of gods. Hells are also described in various [[Purana]]s and other scriptures. The Garuda Purana gives a detailed account of Hell and its features; it lists the amount of punishment for most crimes, much like a modern-day penal code.\n\nIt is believed{{by whom|date=July 2019}} that people who commit sins go to Hell and have to go through punishments in accordance with the sins they committed. The god [[Yama (Hinduism)|Yamar\u0101ja]], who is also the god of death, presides over Hell. Detailed accounts of all the sins committed by an individual are kept by [[Chitragupta]], who is the record keeper in Yama's court. Chitragupta reads out the sins committed and Yama orders appropriate punishments to be given to individuals. These punishments include dipping in boiling oil, burning in fire, torture using various weapons, etc. in various Hells. Individuals who finish their quota of the punishments are reborn in accordance with their balance of [[karma]]. All created beings are imperfect and thus have at least one sin to their record; but if one has generally led a pious life, one ascends to [[svarga]], a temporary realm of enjoyment similar to Paradise, after a brief period of expiation in Hell and before the next reincarnation, according to the law of karma.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}} With the exception of Hindu philosopher [[Madhva]], time in Hell is not regarded as eternal [[damnation]] within Hinduism.<ref name=\"glasenapp\">[[Helmuth von Glasenapp]]: Der Hinduismus.

Left panel depicts the demi-god and his animal vehicle presiding over each Hell.]]\nIn [[Jain cosmology]], Naraka (translated as Hell) is the name given to realm of existence having great suffering. However, a Naraka differs from the hells of [[Abrahamic religions]] as souls are not sent to Naraka as the result of a divine judgment and punishment. Furthermore, length of a being's stay in a Naraka is not eternal, though it is usually very long and measured in billions of years. A soul is born into a Naraka as a direct result of his or her previous [[Karma in Jainism|karma]] (actions of body, speech and mind), and resides there for a finite length of time until his karma has achieved its full result. After his karma is used up, he may be reborn in one of the higher worlds as the result of an earlier karma that had not yet ripened.\n\nThe Hells are situated in the seven grounds at the lower part of the universe. The seven grounds are:\n# Ratna prabha\n# Sharkara prabha.\n# Valuka prabha.\n# Panka prabha.\n# Dhuma prabha.\n# Tamaha prabha.\n# Mahatamaha prabha.\n\nThe hellish beings are a type of souls which are residing in these various hells.

In its home country [[China]], where Taoism adopted tenets of other religions, popular belief endows Taoist Hell with many deities and spirits who punish sin in a variety of horrible ways.\n\n===Chinese folk beliefs===\n{{Main|Diyu}}\n[[File:ROM-ChineseGallery-DemonSculpture.png|upright|thumb|right|A Chinese glazed earthenware sculpture of \"Hell's torturer\", 16th century, [[Ming Dynasty]]]]\n''Diyu'' is the realm of the dead in [[Chinese mythology]]. It is very loosely based upon the [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] concept of [[Naraka (Buddhism)|Naraka]] combined with traditional Chinese afterlife beliefs and a variety of popular expansions and re-interpretations of these two traditions. Ruled by [[Yama (East Asia)|Yanluo Wang]], the King of Hell, Diyu is a maze of underground levels and chambers where souls are taken to atone for their earthly sins.\n\nIncorporating ideas from [[Taoism]] and [[Buddhism]] as well as traditional Chinese folk religion, Diyu is a kind of purgatory place which serves not only to punish but also to renew spirits ready for their next incarnation. There are many deities associated with the place, whose names and purposes are the subject of much conflicting information.\n\nThe exact number of levels in Chinese Hell \u2013 and their associated deities \u2013 differs according to the Buddhist or Taoist perception. Some speak of three to four 'Courts', other as many as ten. The ten judges are also known as the 10 Kings of [[Yama (Buddhism and Chinese mythology)|Yama]]. Each Court deals with a different aspect of atonement. For example, murder is punished in one Court, adultery in another. According to some Chinese legends, there are eighteen levels in Hell. Punishment also varies according to belief, but most legends speak of highly imaginative chambers where wrong-doers are sawn in half, beheaded, thrown into pits of filth or forced to climb trees adorned with sharp blades.\n\nHowever, most legends agree that once a soul (usually referred to as a 'ghost') has atoned for their deeds and repented, he or she is given the Drink of Forgetfulness by [[Meng Po]] and sent back into the world to be reborn, possibly as an animal or a poor or sick person, for further punishment.\n\n==Other religions==\n===Zoroastrianism===\n{{Main|Zoroastrian eschatology}}\n[[Zoroastrianism]] has historically suggested several possible fates for the wicked, including annihilation, purgation in molten metal, and eternal punishment, all of which have standing in Zoroaster's writings. [[Zoroastrian eschatology]] includes the belief that wicked souls will remain in [[Duzakh]] until, following the arrival of three saviors at thousand-year intervals, [[Ahura Mazda]] reconciles the world, destroying evil and resurrecting tormented souls to perfection.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ubfellowship.org/archive/readers/601_zoroastrianism.htm |title=An Introduction to Zoroastrianism |author=Meredith Sprunger |accessdate=10 October 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070206152658/http://www.ubfellowship.org/archive/readers/601_zoroastrianism.htm |archivedate=6 February 2007 }}</ref>\n\nThe sacred [[Gathas]] mention a \"House of the Lie\u2033 for those \"that are of an evil dominion, of evil deeds, evil words, evil Self, and evil thought, Liars.\"<ref>[[Yasna]] 49:11, {{cite web | url=http://www.avesta.org/yasna/y47to50b.htm | title=Avesta: Yasna | accessdate=11 October 2008 | url-status=live | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081009200459/http://www.avesta.org/yasna/y47to50b.htm | archivedate=9 October 2008 | df=dmy-all }}</ref> However, the best-known Zoroastrian text to describe hell in detail is the [[Book of Arda Viraf]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.hell-on-line.org/AboutZOR.html#The%20Fate%20of%20the%20Soul | title=About Zoroastrian Hell | author=Eileen Gardiner | date=10 February 2006 | accessdate=10 October 2008 | url-status=live | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081015035745/http://www.hell-on-line.org/AboutZOR.html#The%20Fate%20of%20the%20Soul | archivedate=15 October 2008 | df=dmy-all }}</ref> It depicts particular punishments for particular sins\u2014for instance, being trampled by cattle as punishment for neglecting the needs of work animals.<ref>Chapter 75, {{cite web | url=http://www.avesta.org/pahlavi/viraf.html | title=The Book of Arda Viraf | accessdate=10 October 2008 | url-status=live | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081008091012/http://www.avesta.org/pahlavi/viraf.html | archivedate=8 October 2008 | df=dmy-all }}</ref> Other descriptions can be found in the ''Book of Scriptures (Hadhokht Nask), Religious Judgments (Dadestan-i Denig)'' and the ''Book of the Judgments of the Spirit of Wisdom (Mainyo-I-Khard)''.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.hell-on-line.org/TextsZOR.html#The%20Fate%20of%20the%20Soul | title=Zoroastrian Hell Texts | author=Eileen Gardiner | date=18 January 2009 | accessdate=24 August 2010 | url-status=live | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100917075010/http://www.hell-on-line.org/TextsZOR.html#The%20Fate%20of%20the%20Soul | archivedate=17 September 2010 | df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n===Mandaeism===\n\nThe [[Mandaeism|Mandaeans]] believe in purification of souls inside of [[Leviathan]],<ref name=\"johannesbuch-a\u201c\">[[Mandaean Book of John|Das Johannesbuch der Mand\u00e4er]], publ. and transl. by [[Mark Lidzbarski]], part 2, Gie\u00dfen 1915, p. 98\u201399.</ref> whom they also call Ur.<ref name=\"jonas-gnostic\u201c\">[[Hans Jonas]]: The Gnostic Religion, 3. ed., Boston 2001, p. 117.</ref> Within detention houses, so called Mattarathas,<ref name=\"ginza-a\u201c\">[[Ginza Rba|Ginza]].

Those laws state that wiccan souls are privileged with reincarnation, but that the souls of wiccans who break the wiccan laws are sent by the goddess to the fiery christian hell.<ref>Gerald Gardner, The Gardnerian Book of Shadows</ref><ref>Alex Sanders, The Alexandrian Book of Shadows</ref> Later wiccan sects do not necessarily include Gerald Gardner's wiccan laws. The influential wiccan author [[Raymond Buckland]] wrote that the wiccan laws are unimportant. Solitary neo-wiccans, who originated in the 1980s, do not include the wiccan laws in their doctrine.\n\n==In literature==\n[[File:William Bouguereau - Dante and Virgile - Google Art Project.jpg|upright|thumb|''[[Dante]] and [[Virgil]] in Hell'' (1850) by [[William-Adolphe Bouguereau]]. In this painting, the two are shown watching the condemned.]]\n\nIn his ''[[Divine Comedy|Divina commedia]]'' (''Divine Comedy''), set in the year 1300), [[Dante|Dante Alighieri]] employed the concept of taking [[Virgil]] as his guide through Inferno (and then, in the second canticle, up the mountain of [[Purgatory|Purgatorio]]). Virgil himself is not condemned to Hell proper in Dante's poem but is rather, as a virtuous pagan, confined to [[Limbo]] just at the edge of Hell. The geography of Hell is very elaborately laid out in this work, with nine concentric rings leading deeper into Earth, and deeper into the various punishments of Hell, until, at the center of the world, Dante finds [[Satan]] himself trapped in the frozen lake of [[Cocytus]]. A small tunnel leads past Satan and out to the other side of the world, at the base of the Mount of Purgatory.\n\n[[John Milton]]'s ''[[Paradise Lost]]'' (1667) opens with the [[fallen angel]]s, including their leader [[Satan]], waking up in Hell after having been defeated in the war in heaven and the action returns there at several points throughout the poem. Milton portrays Hell as the abode of the demons, and the passive prison from which they plot their revenge upon Heaven through the corruption of the human race. 19th-century French poet [[Arthur Rimbaud]] alluded to the concept as well in the title and themes of one of his major works, ''[[Une Saison en Enfer|A Season in Hell]]''. Rimbaud's poetry portrays his own suffering in a poetic form as well as other themes.\n[[File:019Visita al infierno.jpg|thumb|left|''Visit to hell'' by Mexican artist [[Mauricio Garc\u00eda Vega]].]]\nMany of the great epics of European literature include episodes that occur in Hell. In the Roman poet [[Virgil]]'s Latin epic, the ''[[Aeneid]]'', Aeneas descends into [[Hades|Dis]] (the underworld) to visit his father's spirit. The underworld is only vaguely described, with one unexplored path leading to the punishments of Tartarus, while the other leads through Erebus and the Elysian Fields.\n\nThe idea of Hell was highly influential to writers such as [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] who authored the 1944 play ''[[No Exit]]'' about the idea that \"Hell is other people\". Although not a religious man, Sartre was fascinated by his interpretation of a Hellish state of suffering. [[C.S. Lewis]]'s ''[[The Great Divorce]]'' (1945) borrows its title from [[William Blake]]'s ''[[Marriage of Heaven and Hell]]'' (1793) and its inspiration from the ''[[Divine Comedy]]'' as the narrator is likewise guided through Hell and Heaven. Hell is portrayed here as an endless, desolate twilight city upon which night is imperceptibly sinking. The night is actually the [[Apocalypse]], and it heralds the arrival of the demons after their judgment. Before the night comes, anyone can escape Hell if they leave behind their former selves and accept Heaven's offer, and a journey to Heaven reveals that Hell is infinitely small; it is nothing more or less than what happens to a soul that turns away from God and into itself.\n\n==In popular culture==\n{{Main|Hell in popular culture}}\n[[Piers Anthony]] in his series ''[[Incarnations of Immortality]]'' portrays examples of Heaven and Hell via Death, Fate, Underworld, Nature, War, Time, Good-God, and Evil-Devil. [[Robert A. Heinlein]] offers a [[yin-yang]] version of Hell where there is still some good within; most evident in his book ''[[Job: A Comedy of Justice]]''. [[Lois McMaster Bujold]] uses her five Gods 'Father, Mother, Son, Daughter and Bastard' in ''[[The Curse of Chalion]]'' with an example of Hell as formless chaos. [[Michael Moorcock]] is one of many who offer Chaos-Evil-(Hell) and Uniformity-Good-(Heaven) as equally unacceptable extremes which must be held in balance; in particular in the ''[[Elric]]'' and ''[[The Eternal Champion (novel)|Eternal Champion]]'' series. [[Fredric Brown]] wrote a number of [[fantasy]] short stories about [[Satan]]'s activities in Hell. [[Cartoonist]] [[Jimmy Hatlo]] created a series of [[cartoon]]s about life in Hell called ''The Hatlo Inferno'', which ran from 1953 to 1958.<ref>[http://www.cartoonbrew.com/archives/jimmyhatlo.jpg Sample ''Hatlo Inferno'' comic:] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120415045157/http://www.cartoonbrew.com/archives/jimmyhatlo.jpg |date=15 April 2012 }}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Appeal to fear]]\n* [[Damnation]]\n* [[Divine retribution]]\n* [[Harrowing of Hell]]\n* [[Problem of Hell]]\n* [[The Well to Hell hoax]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* [[Thomas Boston|Boston, Thomas]].

[[Religion]]s with a [[philosophy of history#Cyclical and linear history|linear]] [[divinity|divine]] history often depict hells as eternal destinations, the biggest examples of which are [[Christianity]] and [[Islam]], whereas religions with [[reincarnation]] usually depict a hell as an intermediary period between [[incarnation]]s, as is the case in the [[dharmic religions]]. Religions typically locate hell in another dimension or under [[Earth]]'s surface. Other afterlife destinations include [[Heaven]], [[Paradise]], [[Purgatory]], [[Limbo]], and [[the underworld]].\n\nOther religions, which do not conceive of the afterlife as a place of punishment or reward, merely describe an abode of the dead, the [[grave]], a neutral place that is located under the surface of Earth (for example, see [[Kur]], [[Hades]], and [[Sheol]]). Such places are sometimes equated with the English word 'hell', though a more correct translation would be 'underworld' or 'world of the dead'.

Sometimes these distinctions are specific, with [[Damnation#Religious|damned]] souls suffering for each sin committed (see for example Plato's [[myth of Er]] or Dante's ''[[Divine Comedy|The Divine Comedy]]''), but sometimes they are general, with condemned sinners relegated to one or more chamber of Hell or to a level of suffering.\n\nIn many religious cultures, including Christianity and Islam, Hell is often depicted as fiery, painful, and harsh, inflicting suffering on the guilty. Despite these common depictions of Hell as a place of fire, some other traditions portray Hell as cold. Buddhist \u2013 and particularly Tibetan Buddhist \u2013 descriptions of Hell feature an equal number of hot and cold Hells.

In [[Mayan religion]], ''[[Xibalba]]'' (or ''Metnal'') is the dangerous underworld of nine levels. The road into and out of it is said to be steep, thorny and very forbidding. Ritual healers would intone healing prayers banishing diseases to ''Xibalba''. Much of the [[Popol Vuh]] describes the adventures of the [[Maya Hero Twins]] in their cunning struggle with the evil lords of ''Xibalba''.\n\nThe [[Aztec]]s believed that the dead traveled to ''Mictlan'', a neutral place found far to the north. There was also a legend of a place of white flowers, which was always dark, and was home to the gods of death, particularly Mictlantecutli and his spouse Mictlantecihuatl, which means literally \"lords of Mictlan\". The journey to ''Mictlan'' took four years, and the travelers had to overcome difficult tests, such as passing a mountain range where the mountains crashed into each other, a field where the wind carried flesh-scraping knives, and a river of blood with fearsome [[jaguar]]s.\n\n===Oceania===\n\nIn [[Religion in Fiji#Ancient religion|pre-Christian Fijian mythology]] there was belief in an underworld called [[Murimuria]].\n\n==Abrahamic religions==\nHell is conceived of in most Abrahamic religions as a place of, or a form of, [[punishment]].<ref>''Heart of Buddha, Heart of China: James Carter'' \u2013 2010, p 75</ref>\n\n===Judaism===\n{{See also|Gehenna|Sheol}}\nEarly Judaism had no concept of Hell, although the concept of an afterlife was introduced during the [[Hellenistic period]], apparently from neighboring [[Hellenistic religion]]s. It occurs for example in the [[Book of Daniel]]. Daniel 12:2 proclaims \"And many of those who sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake, Some to everlasting life, Some to shame and everlasting contempt.\"\n\n[[Judaism]] does not have a specific doctrine about the afterlife, but it does have a mystical/Orthodox tradition of describing [[Gehinnom]]. Gehinnom is not Hell, but originally a grave and in later times a sort of Purgatory where one is judged based on one's life's deeds, or rather, where one becomes fully aware of one's own shortcomings and negative actions during one's life. The [[Kabbalah]] explains it as a \"waiting room\" (commonly translated as an \"entry way\") for all souls (not just the wicked). The overwhelming majority of rabbinic thought maintains that people are not in Gehinnom forever; the longest that one can be there is said to be 12 months, however there has been the occasional noted exception. Some consider it a spiritual forge where the soul is purified for its eventual ascent to [[Jewish eschatology#The world to come|Olam Habah]] (''heb.'' \u05e2\u05d5\u05dc\u05dd \u05d4\u05d1\u05d0; ''lit.'' \"The world to come\", often viewed as analogous to heaven). This is also mentioned in the Kabbalah, where the soul is described as breaking, like the flame of a candle lighting another: the part of the soul that ascends being pure and the \"unfinished\" piece being reborn.\n\nAccording to Jewish teachings, hell is not entirely physical; rather, it can be compared to a very intense feeling of shame. People are ashamed of their misdeeds and this constitutes suffering which makes up for the bad deeds. When one has so deviated from the will of [[God in Judaism|God]], one is said to be in Gehinnom. This is not meant to refer to some point in the future, but to the very present moment. The gates of [[teshuva]] (return) are said to be always open, and so one can align his will with that of God at any moment. Being out of alignment with God's will is itself a punishment according to the [[Torah]].\n\nMany scholars of Jewish mysticism, particularly of the [[Kabbalah]], describe seven \"compartments\" or \"habitations\" of Hell, just as they describe seven divisions of [[Heaven]]. These divisions go by many different names, and the most frequently mentioned are as follows:<ref>(edit.) Boustan, Ra'anan S. Reed, Annette Yoshiko.

Seventh-day Adventists believe that [[death]] is a state of [[Soul sleep|unconscious sleep]] until the resurrection. They base this belief on biblical texts such as {{Bibleverse||Ecclesiastes|9:5|NIV}} which states \"the dead know nothing\", and {{Bibleverse|1|Thessalonians|4:13\u201318|NIV}} which contains a description of the dead being raised from the [[Grave (burial)|grave]] at the second coming. These verses, it is argued, indicate that death is only a period or form of slumber.\n\nAdventists teach that the resurrection of the righteous will take place shortly after the second coming of [[Jesus]], as described in Revelation 20:4\u20136 that follows Revelation 19:11\u201316, whereas the resurrection of the wicked will occur after the [[millennialism|millennium]], as described in Revelation 20:5 and 20:12\u201313 that follow Revelation 20:4 and 6\u20137, though Revelation 20:12\u201313 and 15 actually describe a ''mixture'' of saved and condemned people being raised from the dead and judged. Adventists reject the traditional doctrine of hell as a state of everlasting conscious torment, believing instead that the wicked will be permanently destroyed after the millennium by the [[lake of fire]], which is called 'the [[second death]]' in Revelation 20:14.\n\nThose Adventist doctrines about death and hell reflect an underlying belief in: (a) conditional immortality (or conditionalism), as opposed to the [[immortality]] of the [[soul]]; and (b) the [[christian anthropology|monistic nature]] of [[human beings]], in which the soul is not separable from the body, as opposed to [[bipartite (theology)|bipartite]] or [[tripartite (theology)|tripartite]] conceptions, in which the soul is separable.\n\n[[Jehovah's Witnesses]] hold that the soul ceases to exist when the person dies<ref name=\"bibleteach\">\"What Does the Bible Really Teach?\", 2005, Published by Jehovah's Witnesses</ref> and therefore that Hell (Sheol or Hades) is a state of non-existence.<ref name=\"bibleteach\" /> In their theology, Gehenna differs from Sheol or Hades in that it holds no hope of a resurrection.<ref name=\"bibleteach\" /> Tartarus is held to be the metaphorical state of debasement of the fallen angels between the time of their moral fall (Genesis chapter 6) until their post-millennial destruction along with Satan (Revelation chapter 20).<ref>\"Insight on the scriptures, Volume 2\", 1988, Published by Jehovah's Witnesses.</ref>\n\n[[Bible Student movement|Bible Students]] and [[Christadelphians]] also believe in annihilationism.\n\n[[Christian Universalism|Christian Universalists]] believe in [[universal reconciliation]], the belief that all human souls will be eventually reconciled with God and admitted to Heaven.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.auburn.edu/~allenkc/chr-univ.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-12-17 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171122135418/http://www.auburn.edu/~allenkc/chr-univ.html |archivedate=22 November 2017 }} What is Christian Universalism by Ken Allen Th.D</ref> This belief is held by some [[Unitarian Universalism|Unitarian-Universalists]].<ref>''New Bible Dictionary'', \"Hell\", InterVarsity Press, 1996.</ref><ref>''New Dictionary of Biblical Theology'', \"Hell\", InterVarsity Press, 2000.</ref><ref>[[Evangelical Alliance]] Commission on Truth and Unity Among Evangelicals, ''The Nature of Hell'', Paternoster, 2000.</ref>\n\nAccording to [[Emanuel Swedenborg]]'s [[Second Coming]] [[Christianity|Christian]] revelation, hell exists because evil people want it.<ref>Swedenborg, E.

Buddhism teaches that there are five{{facr}} (sometimes six{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}) realms of [[Reincarnation|rebirth]], which can then be further subdivided into degrees of agony or pleasure. Of these realms, the hell realms, or ''Naraka'', is the lowest realm of rebirth. Of the hell realms, the worst is ''[[Avici|Av\u012bci]]'' ([[Sanskrit]] and [[Pali]] for \"without waves\"). The Buddha's disciple, [[Devadatta]], who tried to kill the Buddha on three occasions, as well as create a schism in the monastic order, is said{{by whom|date=July 2019}} to have been reborn in the Avici Hell.\n\nLike all realms of rebirth in Buddhism, rebirth in the Hell realms is not permanent, though suffering can persist for eons before being reborn again.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}} In the [[Lotus Sutra]], the Buddha teaches that eventually even Devadatta will become a Pratyekabuddha himself, emphasizing the temporary nature of the Hell realms. Thus, Buddhism teaches to escape the endless migration of rebirths (both positive and negative) through the attainment of [[Nirvana]].\n\nThe [[Bodhisattva]] [[Ksitigarbha]], according to the Ksitigarbha Sutra, made a great vow as a young girl to not reach Nirvana until all beings were liberated from the Hell Realms or other unwholesome rebirths. In popular literature, Ksitigarbha travels to the Hell realms to teach and relieve beings of their suffering.\n\n===Hinduism===\n{{Main|Naraka (Hinduism)}}\n\n[[File:Yama's Court and Hell.jpg|thumb|Yama's Court and Hell. The Blue figure is [[Yamaraja]] (The Hindu god of death) with his consort [[Yami]] and [[Chitragupta]] <br /> 17th-century painting from Government Museum, [[Chennai]].]]\nEarly Vedic religion does not have a concept of Hell. [[\u1e5ag-veda]] mentions three realms, bh\u016br (the [[earth]]), svar (the [[sky]]) and [[Loka|bhuvas]] or antarik\u1e63a (the middle area, i.e. air or [[atmosphere]]). In later Hindu literature, especially the law books and Puranas, more realms are mentioned, including a realm similar to Hell, called [[naraka]] (in Devan\u0101gar\u012b: \u0928\u0930\u0915). [[Yama]] as the first born human (together with his twin sister [[Yamuna in Hinduism|Yam\u012b]]), by virtue of precedence, becomes ruler of men and a judge on their departure. Originally he resides in Heaven, but later, especially medieval, traditions mention his court in naraka.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n\nIn the law-books (sm\u1e5btis and dharma-s\u016btras, like the Manu-sm\u1e5bti), naraka is a place of punishment for sins. It is a lower spiritual plane (called ''naraka-loka'') where the spirit is judged and the partial fruits of [[karma]] affect the next life. In [[Mahabharata]] there is a mention of the [[Pandavas]] and the [[Kauravas]] both going to Heaven. At first Yudhisthir goes to heaven where he sees Duryodhana enjoying heaven; Indra tells him that Duryodhana is in heaven as he did his Kshatriya duties. Then he shows Yudhisthir hell where it appears his brothers are. Later it is revealed that this was a test for Yudhisthir and that his brothers and the Kauravas are all in heaven and live happily in the divine abode of gods. Hells are also described in various [[Purana]]s and other scriptures. The Garuda Purana gives a detailed account of Hell and its features; it lists the amount of punishment for most crimes, much like a modern-day penal code.\n\nIt is believed{{by whom|date=July 2019}} that people who commit sins go to Hell and have to go through punishments in accordance with the sins they committed. The god [[Yama (Hinduism)|Yamar\u0101ja]], who is also the god of death, presides over Hell. Detailed accounts of all the sins committed by an individual are kept by [[Chitragupta]], who is the record keeper in Yama's court. Chitragupta reads out the sins committed and Yama orders appropriate punishments to be given to individuals. These punishments include dipping in boiling oil, burning in fire, torture using various weapons, etc. in various Hells. Individuals who finish their quota of the punishments are reborn in accordance with their balance of [[karma]]. All created beings are imperfect and thus have at least one sin to their record; but if one has generally led a pious life, one ascends to [[svarga]], a temporary realm of enjoyment similar to Paradise, after a brief period of expiation in Hell and before the next reincarnation, according to the law of karma.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}} With the exception of Hindu philosopher [[Madhva]], time in Hell is not regarded as eternal [[damnation]] within Hinduism.<ref name=\"glasenapp\">[[Helmuth von Glasenapp]]: Der Hinduismus.

However, a Naraka differs from the hells of [[Abrahamic religions]] as souls are not sent to Naraka as the result of a divine judgment and punishment. Furthermore, length of a being's stay in a Naraka is not eternal, though it is usually very long and measured in billions of years. A soul is born into a Naraka as a direct result of his or her previous [[Karma in Jainism|karma]] (actions of body, speech and mind), and resides there for a finite length of time until his karma has achieved its full result. After his karma is used up, he may be reborn in one of the higher worlds as the result of an earlier karma that had not yet ripened.\n\nThe Hells are situated in the seven grounds at the lower part of the universe.

According to Jain scripture, [[Tattvarthasutra]], following are the causes for birth in hell:<ref>Sanghvi, Sukhlal (1974) pp.250\u201352</ref>\n#Killing or causing pain with intense passion.\n#Excessive attachment to things and worldly pleasure with constantly indulging in cruel and violent acts.\n#Vowless and unrestrained life.<ref>refer [[Mahavrata]] for the vows and restraints in Jainism</ref>\n\n===Sikhism===\nIn Sikh thought, Heaven and Hell are not places for living hereafter, they are part of spiritual topography of man and do not exist otherwise. They refer to good and evil stages of life respectively and can be lived now and here during our earthly existence.<ref>{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rFm9_Jc1ykcC&pg=PA271 | title=A Complete Guide to Sikhism | publisher=Unistar Books | last=Singh | first=Jagraj | year=2009 | pages=271 | isbn=978-8-1714-2754-3 | url-status=live | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170424012358/https://books.google.com/books?id=rFm9_Jc1ykcC&pg=PA271 | archivedate=24 April 2017 | df=dmy-all }}</ref> For example, [[Guru Arjan]] explains that people who are entangled in emotional attachment and doubt are living in hell on this Earth i.e. their life is hellish.\n\n{{Quotation|<poem>So many are being drowned in emotional attachment and doubt; they dwell in the most horrible hell.</poem>|Guru Arjan|Guru Granth Sahib 297|<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.gurbani?Action=Page&Param=297|title=Sri Granth: Sri Guru Granth Sahib|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170903031902/http://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.gurbani?Action=Page&Param=297|archivedate=3 September 2017}}</ref>}}\n\n===Taoism===\n{{unreferenced section|date=October 2017}}\nAncient [[Taoism]] had no concept of Hell, as morality was seen to be a man-made distinction and there was no concept of an immaterial soul. In its home country [[China]], where Taoism adopted tenets of other religions, popular belief endows Taoist Hell with many deities and spirits who punish sin in a variety of horrible ways.\n\n===Chinese folk beliefs===\n{{Main|Diyu}}\n[[File:ROM-ChineseGallery-DemonSculpture.png|upright|thumb|right|A Chinese glazed earthenware sculpture of \"Hell's torturer\", 16th century, [[Ming Dynasty]]]]\n''Diyu'' is the realm of the dead in [[Chinese mythology]]. It is very loosely based upon the [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] concept of [[Naraka (Buddhism)|Naraka]] combined with traditional Chinese afterlife beliefs and a variety of popular expansions and re-interpretations of these two traditions. Ruled by [[Yama (East Asia)|Yanluo Wang]], the King of Hell, Diyu is a maze of underground levels and chambers where souls are taken to atone for their earthly sins.\n\nIncorporating ideas from [[Taoism]] and [[Buddhism]] as well as traditional Chinese folk religion, Diyu is a kind of purgatory place which serves not only to punish but also to renew spirits ready for their next incarnation. There are many deities associated with the place, whose names and purposes are the subject of much conflicting information.\n\nThe exact number of levels in Chinese Hell \u2013 and their associated deities \u2013 differs according to the Buddhist or Taoist perception. Some speak of three to four 'Courts', other as many as ten. The ten judges are also known as the 10 Kings of [[Yama (Buddhism and Chinese mythology)|Yama]]. Each Court deals with a different aspect of atonement. For example, murder is punished in one Court, adultery in another. According to some Chinese legends, there are eighteen levels in Hell. Punishment also varies according to belief, but most legends speak of highly imaginative chambers where wrong-doers are sawn in half, beheaded, thrown into pits of filth or forced to climb trees adorned with sharp blades.\n\nHowever, most legends agree that once a soul (usually referred to as a 'ghost') has atoned for their deeds and repented, he or she is given the Drink of Forgetfulness by [[Meng Po]] and sent back into the world to be reborn, possibly as an animal or a poor or sick person, for further punishment.\n\n==Other religions==\n===Zoroastrianism===\n{{Main|Zoroastrian eschatology}}\n[[Zoroastrianism]] has historically suggested several possible fates for the wicked, including annihilation, purgation in molten metal, and eternal punishment, all of which have standing in Zoroaster's writings. [[Zoroastrian eschatology]] includes the belief that wicked souls will remain in [[Duzakh]] until, following the arrival of three saviors at thousand-year intervals, [[Ahura Mazda]] reconciles the world, destroying evil and resurrecting tormented souls to perfection.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ubfellowship.org/archive/readers/601_zoroastrianism.htm |title=An Introduction to Zoroastrianism |author=Meredith Sprunger |accessdate=10 October 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070206152658/http://www.ubfellowship.org/archive/readers/601_zoroastrianism.htm |archivedate=6 February 2007 }}</ref>\n\nThe sacred [[Gathas]] mention a \"House of the Lie\u2033 for those \"that are of an evil dominion, of evil deeds, evil words, evil Self, and evil thought, Liars.\"<ref>[[Yasna]] 49:11, {{cite web | url=http://www.avesta.org/yasna/y47to50b.htm | title=Avesta: Yasna | accessdate=11 October 2008 | url-status=live | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081009200459/http://www.avesta.org/yasna/y47to50b.htm | archivedate=9 October 2008 | df=dmy-all }}</ref> However, the best-known Zoroastrian text to describe hell in detail is the [[Book of Arda Viraf]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.hell-on-line.org/AboutZOR.html#The%20Fate%20of%20the%20Soul | title=About Zoroastrian Hell | author=Eileen Gardiner | date=10 February 2006 | accessdate=10 October 2008 | url-status=live | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081015035745/http://www.hell-on-line.org/AboutZOR.html#The%20Fate%20of%20the%20Soul | archivedate=15 October 2008 | df=dmy-all }}</ref> It depicts particular punishments for particular sins\u2014for instance, being trampled by cattle as punishment for neglecting the needs of work animals.<ref>Chapter 75, {{cite web | url=http://www.avesta.org/pahlavi/viraf.html | title=The Book of Arda Viraf | accessdate=10 October 2008 | url-status=live | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081008091012/http://www.avesta.org/pahlavi/viraf.html | archivedate=8 October 2008 | df=dmy-all }}</ref> Other descriptions can be found in the ''Book of Scriptures (Hadhokht Nask), Religious Judgments (Dadestan-i Denig)'' and the ''Book of the Judgments of the Spirit of Wisdom (Mainyo-I-Khard)''.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.hell-on-line.org/TextsZOR.html#The%20Fate%20of%20the%20Soul | title=Zoroastrian Hell Texts | author=Eileen Gardiner | date=18 January 2009 | accessdate=24 August 2010 | url-status=live | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100917075010/http://www.hell-on-line.org/TextsZOR.html#The%20Fate%20of%20the%20Soul | archivedate=17 September 2010 | df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n===Mandaeism===\n\nThe [[Mandaeism|Mandaeans]] believe in purification of souls inside of [[Leviathan]],<ref name=\"johannesbuch-a\u201c\">[[Mandaean Book of John|Das Johannesbuch der Mand\u00e4er]], publ. and transl. by [[Mark Lidzbarski]], part 2, Gie\u00dfen 1915, p. 98\u201399.</ref> whom they also call Ur.<ref name=\"jonas-gnostic\u201c\">[[Hans Jonas]]: The Gnostic Religion, 3. ed., Boston 2001, p. 117.</ref> Within detention houses, so called Mattarathas,<ref name=\"ginza-a\u201c\">[[Ginza Rba|Ginza]].

Those laws state that wiccan souls are privileged with reincarnation, but that the souls of wiccans who break the wiccan laws are sent by the goddess to the fiery christian hell.<ref>Gerald Gardner, The Gardnerian Book of Shadows</ref><ref>Alex Sanders, The Alexandrian Book of Shadows</ref> Later wiccan sects do not necessarily include Gerald Gardner's wiccan laws. The influential wiccan author [[Raymond Buckland]] wrote that the wiccan laws are unimportant. Solitary neo-wiccans, who originated in the 1980s, do not include the wiccan laws in their doctrine.\n\n==In literature==\n[[File:William Bouguereau - Dante and Virgile - Google Art Project.jpg|upright|thumb|''[[Dante]] and [[Virgil]] in Hell'' (1850) by [[William-Adolphe Bouguereau]]. In this painting, the two are shown watching the condemned.]]\n\nIn his ''[[Divine Comedy|Divina commedia]]'' (''Divine Comedy''), set in the year 1300), [[Dante|Dante Alighieri]] employed the concept of taking [[Virgil]] as his guide through Inferno (and then, in the second canticle, up the mountain of [[Purgatory|Purgatorio]]). Virgil himself is not condemned to Hell proper in Dante's poem but is rather, as a virtuous pagan, confined to [[Limbo]] just at the edge of Hell. The geography of Hell is very elaborately laid out in this work, with nine concentric rings leading deeper into Earth, and deeper into the various punishments of Hell, until, at the center of the world, Dante finds [[Satan]] himself trapped in the frozen lake of [[Cocytus]]. A small tunnel leads past Satan and out to the other side of the world, at the base of the Mount of Purgatory.\n\n[[John Milton]]'s ''[[Paradise Lost]]'' (1667) opens with the [[fallen angel]]s, including their leader [[Satan]], waking up in Hell after having been defeated in the war in heaven and the action returns there at several points throughout the poem. Milton portrays Hell as the abode of the demons, and the passive prison from which they plot their revenge upon Heaven through the corruption of the human race. 19th-century French poet [[Arthur Rimbaud]] alluded to the concept as well in the title and themes of one of his major works, ''[[Une Saison en Enfer|A Season in Hell]]''. Rimbaud's poetry portrays his own suffering in a poetic form as well as other themes.\n[[File:019Visita al infierno.jpg|thumb|left|''Visit to hell'' by Mexican artist [[Mauricio Garc\u00eda Vega]].]]\nMany of the great epics of European literature include episodes that occur in Hell. In the Roman poet [[Virgil]]'s Latin epic, the ''[[Aeneid]]'', Aeneas descends into [[Hades|Dis]] (the underworld) to visit his father's spirit. The underworld is only vaguely described, with one unexplored path leading to the punishments of Tartarus, while the other leads through Erebus and the Elysian Fields.\n\nThe idea of Hell was highly influential to writers such as [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] who authored the 1944 play ''[[No Exit]]'' about the idea that \"Hell is other people\". Although not a religious man, Sartre was fascinated by his interpretation of a Hellish state of suffering. [[C.S. Lewis]]'s ''[[The Great Divorce]]'' (1945) borrows its title from [[William Blake]]'s ''[[Marriage of Heaven and Hell]]'' (1793) and its inspiration from the ''[[Divine Comedy]]'' as the narrator is likewise guided through Hell and Heaven. Hell is portrayed here as an endless, desolate twilight city upon which night is imperceptibly sinking. The night is actually the [[Apocalypse]], and it heralds the arrival of the demons after their judgment. Before the night comes, anyone can escape Hell if they leave behind their former selves and accept Heaven's offer, and a journey to Heaven reveals that Hell is infinitely small; it is nothing more or less than what happens to a soul that turns away from God and into itself.\n\n==In popular culture==\n{{Main|Hell in popular culture}}\n[[Piers Anthony]] in his series ''[[Incarnations of Immortality]]'' portrays examples of Heaven and Hell via Death, Fate, Underworld, Nature, War, Time, Good-God, and Evil-Devil. [[Robert A. Heinlein]] offers a [[yin-yang]] version of Hell where there is still some good within; most evident in his book ''[[Job: A Comedy of Justice]]''. [[Lois McMaster Bujold]] uses her five Gods 'Father, Mother, Son, Daughter and Bastard' in ''[[The Curse of Chalion]]'' with an example of Hell as formless chaos. [[Michael Moorcock]] is one of many who offer Chaos-Evil-(Hell) and Uniformity-Good-(Heaven) as equally unacceptable extremes which must be held in balance; in particular in the ''[[Elric]]'' and ''[[The Eternal Champion (novel)|Eternal Champion]]'' series. [[Fredric Brown]] wrote a number of [[fantasy]] short stories about [[Satan]]'s activities in Hell. [[Cartoonist]] [[Jimmy Hatlo]] created a series of [[cartoon]]s about life in Hell called ''The Hatlo Inferno'', which ran from 1953 to 1958.<ref>[http://www.cartoonbrew.com/archives/jimmyhatlo.jpg Sample ''Hatlo Inferno'' comic:] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120415045157/http://www.cartoonbrew.com/archives/jimmyhatlo.jpg |date=15 April 2012 }}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Appeal to fear]]\n* [[Damnation]]\n* [[Divine retribution]]\n* [[Harrowing of Hell]]\n* [[Problem of Hell]]\n* [[The Well to Hell hoax]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* [[Thomas Boston|Boston, Thomas]].
