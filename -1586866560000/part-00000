To support [[United Kingdom|Britain]], the ship operated under the [[Combined Shipping Adjustment Board]]. At the request of Britain, the Benjamin Contee was used to transport [[Italians|Italian]] [[prisoners of War]] from [[El Alamein]], [[Egypt]] to [[Oran]], [[Algeria]]. With 1800 Italian [[POW]]\u2019s onboard and just 23 minutes out of El Alamein in the [[Mediterranean Sea]] on August 16, 1943 at night she was hit by a [[Nazi Germany]] [[aircraft]] dropped [[aerial torpedo]] 16 miles north of [[Bone, Algeria]]. The explosion killed 264 and injures 142 of the 1,800 Italian POWs on board. There were no casualties to the crew of 43 [[Merchant Marine]]s, 27 [[US Navy Armed Guard]], 26 British guards, and 7 Army security detail. It was a harrowing experience for the POWs in the [[cargo hold]]s. Many of the POWs later would join the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] [[Italian Service Units]]. The torpedo hit in cargo hold No. 1 and No. 2, which flooded quickly. The able Italian POW when to the [[Lifeboat (shipboard)|lifeboats]], but they did not know how to lower them. The flooding of hold 1 and 2 caused the [[bow (ship)|bow]] to start to sink and [[rudder]] and [[propeller]] to rise out of the water. Cargo hold 4 and 5 were flooded so the propeller was back in the water, thus the ship could continue. \nUnder her own power, she was able to continue to [[Bone, Algeria]] for temporary repairs. The ship was received permanent repairs at Gibraltar to fix the 25 by 21-foot hole in her side. After repairs, she returned to [[New York City]] and returned to [[Southampton]].\n\nNext on March 14, 1944 she took part in convoy SC-155 (Liverpool-Halifax). SC-155 was a convoy of slower ships, traveling at 4 knots. She joined SC-155 was she was not able to travel at she top speed of 11 knots after her damage.\n\n==Normandy landings D-Day==\nDue to ''Benjamin Contee'' damage, she was selecited to help with the [[Normandy landings]], she was used as a sea [[breakwater (structure)|breakwater]] by [[scuttling]] on the 8 June 1944 in position Gooseberry No. 1 in [[Mulberry Harbour]] off of [[Utah Beach]], [[Normandy]] at the beachhead.  She was damaged more by a severe storm on 19\u201322 June 1944. On July 16, 1944 she was declared a complete loss and officially abandoned. Nine other ships were scuttled to from [[Mulberry harbour#Breakwaters|Gooseberry 1]].  Some of the other ships were the ''David O. Saylor'', ''George S. Wasson'', ''Matt W.

To support [[United Kingdom|Britain]], the ship operated under the [[Combined Shipping Adjustment Board]]. At the request of Britain, the Benjamin Contee was used to transport [[Italians|Italian]] [[prisoners of War]] from [[El Alamein]], [[Egypt]] to [[Oran]], [[Algeria]]. With 1800 Italian [[POW]]\u2019s onboard and just 23 minutes out of El Alamein in the [[Mediterranean Sea]] on August 16, 1943 at night she was hit by a [[Nazi Germany]] [[aircraft]] dropped [[aerial torpedo]] 16 miles north of [[Bone, Algeria]]. The explosion killed 264 and injures 142 of the 1,800 Italian POWs on board. There were no casualties to the crew of 43 [[Merchant Marine]]s, 27 [[US Navy Armed Guard]], 26 British guards, and 7 Army security detail. It was a harrowing experience for the POWs in the [[cargo hold]]s. Many of the POWs later would join the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] [[Italian Service Units]]. The torpedo hit in cargo hold No. 1 and No. 2, which flooded quickly. The able Italian POW when to the [[Lifeboat (shipboard)|lifeboats]], but they did not know how to lower them. The flooding of hold 1 and 2 caused the [[bow (ship)|bow]] to start to sink and [[rudder]] and [[propeller]] to rise out of the water. Cargo hold 4 and 5 were flooded so the propeller was back in the water, thus the ship could continue. \nUnder her own power, she was able to continue to [[Bone, Algeria]] for temporary repairs. The ship was received permanent repairs at Gibraltar to fix the 25 by 21-foot hole in her side. After repairs, she returned to [[New York City]] and returned to [[Southampton]].\n\nNext on March 14, 1944 she took part in convoy SC-155 (Liverpool-Halifax). SC-155 was a convoy of slower ships, traveling at 4 knots. She joined SC-155 was she was not able to travel at she top speed of 11 knots after her damage.\n\n==Normandy landings D-Day==\nDue to ''Benjamin Contee'' damage, she was selecited to help with the [[Normandy landings]], she was used as a sea [[breakwater]] by [[scuttling]] on the 8 June 1944 in position Gooseberry No. 1 in [[Mulberry Harbour]] off of [[Utah Beach]], [[Normandy]] at the beachhead.  She was damaged more by a severe storm on 19\u201322 June 1944. On July 16, 1944 she was declared a complete loss and officially abandoned. Nine other ships were scuttled to from [[Mulberry harbour#Breakwaters|Gooseberry 1]].  Some of the other ships were the ''David O. Saylor'', ''George S. Wasson'', ''Matt W. Ransom'', {{SS|West Cheswald||2}}, {{SS|West Honaker||2}}, {{SS|West Nohno||2}}, ''Willis A.

This covers approximately the [[East Midlands]] of England ([[Derbyshire]], [[Leicestershire]], [[Lincolnshire]], [[Nottinghamshire]], [[Rutland]] and [[Northamptonshire]]). In relation to other English dialects, there have been fewer studies investigating features of East Midlands English.\n\n==Origins==\n[[Image:Midland Map - 5 Boroughs 912 Ad.svg|thumb|The Five Boroughs of the East Midlands distinct from the Kingdom of Mercia in the early 10th century<ref>Falkus & Gillingham and Hill.</ref>]]\nThe Eastern English Midlands were incorporated in the Norse-controlled [[Danelaw]] in the late 9th century by [[Ivar the Boneless]]. With their conquest, the county towns of the East Midlands counties were converted into fortified, Viking city-states, known as the [[Five Boroughs of the Danelaw]]. The region's dialect owes much of its grammar and vocabulary to the Nordic influences of its conquerors. For example, the East Midlands verb ''to scraight'' ('to cry') is thought to be derived from the Norse, ''skrike'' in modern Scandinavian, also meaning to cry.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/insideout/eastmidlands/series7/dialect_voices.shtml |title=BBC Inside Out \u2013 Dialect |website=BBC |date=17 January 2005 |accessdate=24 July 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe East Midlands dialect of [[Middle English]] is the precursor of modern English spoken today.<ref>{{Cite book | chapter-url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780192800619.001.0001/acref-9780192800619-e-392 |isbn = 9780192800619|title = Concise Oxford Companion to the English Language|chapter = East Midland Dialect|publisher = Oxford University Press|date = January 2003}}</ref>\n\n==East Midlands dialects in literature==\nThe romantic novelist and East Midlander [[D.

However, more recently its linguistic distinctiveness has significantly eroded due to influences from the western parts of [[East Anglia]], the [[West Midlands (region)|West Midlands]], and the South as well as the 'Watford Gap [[isogloss]]', the demarcation line between southern and northern English accents.\n\nThe Danelaw split the present county into a Viking north and a Saxon south. This is quite plainly heard, with people in the south speaking more like people from Oxfordshire or Cambridgeshire and people in the north sounding more like people from Leicestershire.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}\n\n===Corbyite===\nAlso of note is the anomalous dialect of Corbyite spoken around [[Corby]] in the north of [[Northamptonshire]], which reflects the migration of large numbers of Scottish and Irish steelworkers to the town during the 20th century. The dialect is often compared to [[Glasgow patter|Glaswegian]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}\n\n===Derbyshire===\nThe dialect of [[Coalville]] in Leicestershire is said to resemble that of Derbyshire because many of the Coalville miners came from there. Coalville's name is still almost exclusive pronounced as \"Co-ville\" by its inhabitants. Neighbouring pit villages such as Whitwick (\"Whittick\") share the Coalville inflection as a result of the same huge influx of Derbyshire miners.\n\nThe city of Derby, as well as boroughs in the vicinity of the city such as Amber Valley and Erewash share a common Derby dialect, which sounds largely similar to other East Midlands dialects such as Nottingham and Leicester. However, many other dialects in the county are influenced by neighbouring areas and cities. For example, the dialect of [[Glossop]] in the [[High Peak, Derbyshire|High Peak]] borough is largely similar to the North West's [[Manchester dialect]] due to its close geographical position to [[Greater Manchester]] {{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}, while that of [[Chesterfield]] and [[Bolsover District|Bolsover]] share commonalities with the South Yorkshire dialect owing to their proximity to [[Sheffield]] and [[Doncaster]]. In addition, the dialect of the [[Derbyshire Dales]] is near identical to that of the bordering North [[Staffordshire]], mimicking dialects in and around [[Stoke-on-Trent]], as well as that of [[Crewe]] in Cheshire, North West England.\n\n===Lincolnshire and East Lincolnshire===\n[[Lincolnshire]] has long been an economically relatively homogeneous, less industrial more heavily agricultural county and is in part naturally separated by the [[River Trent]] divorcing its largest market town, Gainsborough, Torksey & the City of [[Lincoln, England|Lincoln]] from [[Nottinghamshire]]. East of the [[Lincolnshire Wolds]], in the southern part of the county, the Lincolnshire dialect is closely linked to [[The Fens]] and [[East Anglia]] where [[East Anglian English]] is spoken, and, in the northern areas of the county, the local speech has characteristics in common with the speech of the [[East Riding of Yorkshire]]. This is largely due to the fact that the majority of the land area of Lincolnshire was surrounded by sea, the [[Humber Estuary|Humber]], marshland, and the Wolds; these geographical circumstances permitted little linguistic interference from the East Midlands dialects until the nineteenth century when canal and rail routes penetrated the eastern heartland of the country.\n\n===Nottinghamshire===\nMinor variations still endure between [[Nottinghamshire]] and [[Derbyshire]]. Though all native speakers sound similar, there are noticeable differences between the accents of residents of, for example, [[Nottingham]] and [[Derby]]{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}, or [[Mansfield]] and [[Bolsover]] which is pronounced locally as {{IPAc-en|b|o\u028a|z|\u0259}}.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}\n\nIn North Nottinghamshire and North-East Derbyshire, the dialect is very similar to South Yorkshire, including the occasional use of the pronoun [[thou]] amongst older people. See Stephen Whyles's book ''A Scab is no Son of Mine'' for examples of speech of the [[Worksop]] area.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\nActress and singer [[Su Pollard]] is well known for her broad Nottinghamshire accent.\n\n==Counties in which East Midlands English is spoken==\n*[[Cambridgeshire]] (Limited usage around [[Peterborough]])\n*[[Derbyshire]] (Limited usage in northern areas such as [[High Peak, Derbyshire|High Peak]], [[Chesterfield]] and [[Bolsover District|Bolsover]])\n*[[Leicestershire]]\n*[[Lincolnshire]] (except areas within the [[Yorkshire and the Humber]] region)\n*[[Nottinghamshire]] (Usage less frequent in [[Bassetlaw District|Bassetlaw]])\n*[[Northamptonshire]]\n*[[Rutland]]\n*[[Staffordshire]] (Limited usage around [[Burton-upon-Trent]] and [[Uttoxeter]])\n\n==In popular culture==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2018}}\nThe children's writer [[Helen Cresswell]] came from Nottingham, lived in [[Eakring]] and some of her characters featured on television during the 1970s and 1980s, such as [[Lizzie Dripping]] and [[The Secret World of Polly Flint|Polly Flint]], have distinct East Midlands accents, otherwise rarely heard in national broadcast media at the time.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n;Notes\n{{Reflist|group=n}}\n;References\n{{Reflist |30em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n*[[Arthur Benoni Evans|Evans, Arthur Benoni]] (1881) ''Leicestershire Words, Phrases and Sayings''; ed. by [[Sebastian Evans]].

With their conquest, the county towns of the East Midlands counties were converted into fortified, Viking city-states, known as the [[Five Boroughs of the Danelaw]]. The region's dialect owes much of its grammar and vocabulary to the Nordic influences of its conquerors. For example, the East Midlands verb ''to scraight'' ('to cry') is thought to be derived from the Norse, ''skrike'' in modern Scandinavian, also meaning to cry.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/insideout/eastmidlands/series7/dialect_voices.shtml |title=BBC Inside Out \u2013 Dialect |website=BBC |date=17 January 2005 |accessdate=24 July 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe East Midlands dialect of [[Middle English]] is the precursor of modern English spoken today.<ref>{{Cite book | chapter-url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780192800619.001.0001/acref-9780192800619-e-392 |isbn = 9780192800619|title = Concise Oxford Companion to the English Language|chapter = East Midland Dialect|publisher = Oxford University Press|date = January 2003}}</ref>\n\n==East Midlands dialects in literature==\nThe romantic novelist and East Midlander [[D.

People who watched them sometimes remarked that they could \"swim like ducks\", an observation [[Joseph Masters]] once remarked in his memoirs.

East Midlands English follows a series of distinct grammatical rules. Some examples follow below.\n\n===Formal address===\n\nUntil the mid-20th century, it was not uncommon to hear the use of informal forms of address, [[thee]] and [[thou]], as compared to the more formal [[you]]. Use of the informal form of address is now uncommon in modern speech.\n\n===Personal and possessive pronouns===\n\nPersonal pronouns differ from standard English as follows:\n\n{| cellspacing=\"40\"\n|\n;yorn:yours\n;mine:mine\n|\n;theirn:theirs\n;ourn:ours\n|\n;hisn:his\n;ern:hers\n|}\n\nExample: ''It eent theirn; it's ourn!''

(We shall have to do it ourselves.)\n\n==Vocabulary==\nHumorous texts, such as ''Nottingham As it is Spoke,'' have used their phonetically spelled words to deliberately confuse non-natives of the region.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.theoldmeadows.co.uk/books.htm |title=Books |publisher=The Old Meadows.co.uk |date= |accessdate=24 July 2011}}</ref>\n\n;Alrate youth?:Are you alright young man?

However, more recently its linguistic distinctiveness has significantly eroded due to influences from the western parts of [[East Anglia]], the [[West Midlands (region)|West Midlands]], and the South as well as the 'Watford Gap [[isogloss]]', the demarcation line between southern and northern English accents.\n\nThe Danelaw split the present county into a Viking north and a Saxon south. This is quite plainly heard, with people in the south speaking more like people from Oxfordshire or Cambridgeshire and people in the north sounding more like people from Leicestershire.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}\n\n===Corbyite===\nAlso of note is the anomalous dialect of Corbyite spoken around [[Corby]] in the north of [[Northamptonshire]], which reflects the migration of large numbers of Scottish and Irish steelworkers to the town during the 20th century. The dialect is often compared to [[Glasgow patter|Glaswegian]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}\n\n===Derbyshire===\nThe dialect of [[Coalville]] in Leicestershire is said to resemble that of Derbyshire because many of the Coalville miners came from there. Coalville's name is still almost exclusive pronounced as \"Co-ville\" by its inhabitants. Neighbouring pit villages such as Whitwick (\"Whittick\") share the Coalville inflection as a result of the same huge influx of Derbyshire miners.\n\nThe city of Derby, as well as boroughs in the vicinity of the city such as Amber Valley and Erewash share a common Derby dialect, which sounds largely similar to other East Midlands dialects such as Nottingham and Leicester. However, many other dialects in the county are influenced by neighbouring areas and cities. For example, the dialect of [[Glossop]] in the [[High Peak, Derbyshire|High Peak]] borough is largely similar to the North West's [[Manchester dialect]] due to its close geographical position to [[Greater Manchester]] {{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}, while that of [[Chesterfield]] and [[Bolsover District|Bolsover]] share commonalities with the South Yorkshire dialect owing to their proximity to [[Sheffield]] and [[Doncaster]]. In addition, the dialect of the [[Derbyshire Dales]] is near identical to that of the bordering North [[Staffordshire]], mimicking dialects in and around [[Stoke-on-Trent]], as well as that of [[Crewe]] in Cheshire, North West England.\n\n===Lincolnshire and East Lincolnshire===\n[[Lincolnshire]] has long been an economically relatively homogeneous, less industrial more heavily agricultural county and is in part naturally separated by the [[River Trent]] divorcing its largest market town, Gainsborough, Torksey & the City of [[Lincoln, England|Lincoln]] from [[Nottinghamshire]]. East of the [[Lincolnshire Wolds]], in the southern part of the county, the Lincolnshire dialect is closely linked to [[The Fens]] and [[East Anglia]] where [[East Anglian English]] is spoken, and, in the northern areas of the county, the local speech has characteristics in common with the speech of the [[East Riding of Yorkshire]]. This is largely due to the fact that the majority of the land area of Lincolnshire was surrounded by sea, the [[Humber Estuary|Humber]], marshland, and the Wolds; these geographical circumstances permitted little linguistic interference from the East Midlands dialects until the nineteenth century when canal and rail routes penetrated the eastern heartland of the country.\n\n===Nottinghamshire===\nMinor variations still endure between [[Nottinghamshire]] and [[Derbyshire]]. Though all native speakers sound similar, there are noticeable differences between the accents of residents of, for example, [[Nottingham]] and [[Derby]]{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}, or [[Mansfield]] and [[Bolsover]] which is pronounced  locally as {{IPAc-en|b|o\u028a|z|\u0259}}.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}\n\nIn North Nottinghamshire and North-East Derbyshire, the dialect is very similar to South Yorkshire, including the occasional use of the pronoun [[thou]] amongst older people.  See Stephen Whyles's book ''A Scab is no Son of Mine'' for examples of speech of the [[Worksop]] area.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\n==Counties in which East Midlands English is spoken==\n*[[Cambridgeshire]] (Limited usage around [[Peterborough]])\n*[[Derbyshire]] (Limited usage in northern areas such as [[High Peak, Derbyshire|High Peak]], [[Chesterfield]] and [[Bolsover District|Bolsover]])\n*[[Leicestershire]]\n*[[Lincolnshire]] (except areas within the [[Yorkshire and the Humber]] region)\n*[[Nottinghamshire]] (Usage less frequent in [[Bassetlaw District|Bassetlaw]])\n*[[Northamptonshire]]\n*[[Rutland]]\n*[[Staffordshire]] (Limited usage around [[Burton-upon-Trent]] and [[Uttoxeter]])\n\n==In popular culture==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2018}}\nThe children's writer [[Helen Cresswell]] came from Nottingham, lived in [[Eakring]] and some of her characters featured on television during the 1970s and 1980s, such as [[Lizzie Dripping]] and [[The Secret World of Polly Flint|Polly Flint]], have distinct East Midlands accents, otherwise rarely heard in national broadcast media at the time.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n;Notes\n{{Reflist|group=n}}\n;References\n{{Reflist |30em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n*[[Arthur Benoni Evans|Evans, Arthur Benoni]] (1881) ''Leicestershire Words, Phrases and Sayings''; ed. by [[Sebastian Evans]].
