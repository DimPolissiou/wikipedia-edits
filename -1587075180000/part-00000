Based on his time at [[Indian Springs School]]<nowiki/>, Green wrote the novel as a result of his desire to create meaningful [[young adult fiction]].<ref name=\":7\" /> The characters and events of the plot are grounded in Green's life, while the story itself is fictional.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\n''Looking for Alaska'' follows the novel's main character and narrator Miles Halter, or \"Pudge,\" to boarding school where he goes to seek the \"Great Perhaps,\" the famous last words of [[Fran\u00e7ois Rabelais]]. Throughout the first half of the novel, Miles and his friends Chip \"The Colonel\" Martin, Alaska Young, and Takumi Hikohito grow very close and the section culminates in Alaska's death. In the second half of the novel, Miles and his friends work to discover the missing details of the night Alaska died. While struggling to reconcile Alaska's death, Miles grapples with  Sim\u00f3n Bolivar's last words and the meaning of life, leaving the conclusion to these topics unresolved.\n\n''Looking for Alaska'' is a coming-of-age novel that touches on themes of meaning, grief, hope, and youth-adult relationships. The novel won the 2006 [[Michael L. Printz Award]] from the [[American Library Association]], and led the association's list of most-challenged books in 2015 due to profanity and a sexually explicit scene.<ref name=\":8\" /> Schools in Kentucky, Tennessee, and several other states have attempted to place bans on the book. In 2005, [[Paramount Pictures]] received the rights to produce a film adaption of ''Looking for Alaska''; however, the film failed to reach production.<ref name=\":9\" /> ''Looking for Alaska'' premiered as a [[List of original programs distributed by Hulu|Hulu Original]] on October 18, 2019.<ref name=\":10\" />\n\n==Background==\n[[File:John Green by Gage Skidmore.jpg|thumb|upright|John Green, author of ''Looking for Alaska'', in 2014]]\n''Looking for Alaska'' is based on John Green's early life. Growing up, Green always loved writing, but when it came to his [[Middle school#United States|middle school]] experience, he classified life as a middle schooler as \"pretty bleak\".<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite document|title=John Green: From Bad Boy to Printz Award Winner|last=MacPherson|first=Karen|id = {{ProQuest|390783985}}}}{{subscription required|via=[[ProQuest}}{{full citation needed|date=December 2019|reason=Cannot verify from info provided}}</ref> As a student, Green describes that he was \"unbearable\" to parents and teachers; however, he always worked hard to fit in with his peers.<ref name=\":7\">{{Cite document|title=\"Literature Is Not a Cold, Dead Place\": An Interview with John Green|last=Barkdoll|first=Jayme|id = {{ProQuest|237309696}}}}{{subscription required|via=[[ProQuest}}{{full citation needed|date=December 2019|reason=Cannot verify from info provided}}</ref> Green's situation did not improve after his transition to high school, so he asked his parents if he could attend [[Indian Springs School]], a boarding school outside of [[Birmingham, Alabama|Birmingham]], [[Alabama]]. His parents agreed, and he spent the remainder of his time in high school at Indian Springs School forming valuable relationships with teachers, relationships that Green says still exist today.<ref name=\":0\" /> Green's experience at boarding school inspired him to write ''Looking for Alaska.'' Many of the characters and events that take place in the novel are based on what Green experienced at Indian Springs,<ref name=\":0\" /> including the death of a central character in the novel.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://go.galegroup.com/ps/i.do?p=LitRC&id=GALE%7CA131082448&v=2.1&it=r&sid=LitRC&asid=be97446d |title=Last Words From a First Novelist |last=Cooper |first=Ilene |access-date=2019-04-24}}</ref>\n\nDuring a [[book talk]] at [[Rivermont Collegiate]] on October 19, 2006, Green shared that the idea of Takumi's \"fox hat\" in ''Looking for Alaska'' originated from a Filipino friend who wore a similar hat while playing pranks at the school. He also noted that his inspiration for the possessed swan in Culver Creek derived from a similar swan he remembers at Indian Springs. The two pranks that occur in the book are similar to pranks that Green pulled at school, but Green emphasizes that while the setting is based on his life, the novel is entirely fictional.<ref>{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JLuF8GmtH4|title=John Green's Legendary High School Prank|date=8 December 2007|work=YouTube|accessdate=3 November 2019}}</ref>\n\nAs a child, Green became infatuated with famous last words, specifically those of [[John Adams]]. His fascination with last words lead him to finding other famous last words, including those of [[Emily Dickinson]], [[Oscar Wilde]], and [[Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar]].<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite web|url=http://go.galegroup.com/ps/i.do?p=LitRC&id=GALE%7CA131082448&v=2.1&it=r&sid=LitRC&asid=be97446d|title=Last Words From a First Novelist|last=Cooper|first=Ilene|access-date=2019-04-28}}</ref> Green passes this love of last words onto the main character, Miles, and uses Bolivar's last words to inspire a search for meaning in the face of tragedy for the characters of his novel.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n==Plot==\nMiles Halter, a teenage boy obsessed with last words, leaves his normal high school in Florida to attend Culver Creek Preparatory High School in Alabama for his junior year.

Learning of Pudge's obsession with famous last words, Alaska informs him of [[Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar|Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar's]]: \"Damn it. How will I ever get out of this labyrinth!\"<ref name=\"Book\">{{cite book|last1=Green|first1=John|title=Looking for Alaska|date=28 December 2006|publisher=Penguin Young Readers Group|isbn=9780142402511|page=[https://archive.org/details/lookingforalaska00john/page/25 25]|url=https://archive.org/details/lookingforalaska00john/page/25}}</ref> The two make a deal that if Pudge figures out what the labyrinth is and how to escape it, Alaska will find him a girlfriend. Alaska sets Pudge up with a Romanian classmate, Lara. Unfortunately, Pudge and Lara have a disastrous date, ending with a concussed Pudge throwing up on Lara. Alaska and Pudge grow closer and he begins to fall in love with her, although she insists on keeping their relationship [[Platonic love|platonic]] because she has a boyfriend at [[Vanderbilt University]] whom she insists she loves.\n\nOn his first night at Culver Creek, Pudge is kidnapped and thrown into a lake by the \"Weekday Warriors,\" a group of rich schoolmates who blame the Colonel and his friends for the expulsion of their friend, Paul. Paul's expulsion created tension between Pudge's friends and the Weekday Warriors. Takumi claims that they are innocent because their friend Marya was also [[expulsion (education)#United States and Canada|expelled]] during the incident.  However, Alaska later admits that she told on both Marya and Paul to the dean, Mr. Starnes, to save herself from being expelled.\n\nThe gang celebrates a successful series of pranks by drinking and partying, and an inebriated Alaska confides about her mother's death from an [[aneurysm]] when she was eight years old. Although she didn't understand at the time, she feels guilty for not calling 911. Pudge figures that her mother's death made Alaska impulsive and rash. He concludes that the labyrinth was a person's suffering and that humans must try to find their way out. Afterwards, Pudge grows closer to Lara, and they start dating. A week later, after another 'celebration', an intoxicated Alaska and Pudge spend the night with each other, when suddenly Alaska receives a phone call which causes her to go into hysterics. Insisting that she has to leave, Alaska drives away while drunk with Pudge and the Colonel distracting Mr. Starnes. They later learn that Alaska was [[driving under the influence|DUI]] and died.\n\nThe Colonel and Pudge are devastated and blame themselves, wondering about her reasons for undertaking the urgent drive and even contemplating that she might have deliberately killed herself. The Colonel insists on questioning Jake, her boyfriend, but Pudge refuses, fearing that he might learn that Alaska never loved him. They argue and the Colonel accuses Pudge of only loving an idealized Alaska that Pudge made up in his head. Pudge realizes the truth of this and reconciles with the Colonel.\n\nAs a way of celebrating Alaska's life, Pudge, the Colonel, Takumi, and Lara team up with the Weekday Warriors to hire a male stripper to speak at Culver's Speaker Day. The whole school finds it hilarious; Mr. Starnes even acknowledges how clever it was. Pudge finds Alaska's copy of ''[[The General in His Labyrinth]]'' with the labyrinth quote underlined and notices the words \"straight and fast\" written in the margins. He remembers Alaska died on the morning after the anniversary of her mother's death and concludes that Alaska felt guilty for not visiting her mother's grave and, in her rush, might have been trying to reach the cemetery. On the last day of school, Takumi confesses in a note that he was the last person to see Alaska, and he let her go as well. Pudge realizes that letting her go doesn't matter as much anymore. He forgives Alaska for dying, as he knows Alaska forgives him for letting her go.\n\n== Style ==\n''Looking for Alaska'' is divided into two halves and narrated by main character Miles Halter. Rather than the typical numerical system, each chapter is denoted through the number of days before Alaska's death or the number of days after. The genesis of this structure resulted from John Green's influence of public reactions to the events on [[September 11 attacks|September 11, 2001.]] <ref name=\":33\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/292717/looking-for-alaska-by-john-green/9780593109069|title=Looking for Alaska by John Green - Reading Guide: 9780593109069 - PenguinRandomHouse.com: Books|website=PenguinRandomhouse.com|language=en-US|access-date=2019-12-09}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/childrens/childrens-authors/article/65089-john-green-celebrates-10-years-of-looking-for-alaska.html|title=John Green Celebrates 10 Years of 'Looking for Alaska'|last=Maughan|first=Shannon|date=2014|website=Publisher's Weekly|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> In an interview with [[Random House|Random House Publishing]], Green recalled that newscasters stated that people would now view the world through the lens of either before or after 9/11.<ref name=\":33\"/> Green says in the same interview, \u201cWe look back to the most important moment in our history, and that becomes the dividing line between what we were and what we are now.

While looking for answers, the boys are subconsciously dealing with their grief, and their obsession with finding answers transforms into a search for meaning. Pudge and Colonel want to find out the answers to certain questions surrounding Alaska's death, but in reality, they are enduring their own labyrinths of suffering, a concept central to the novel. When their theology teacher Mr. Hyde poses a question to his class about the meaning of life, Pudge takes this opportunity to write about it as a labyrinth of suffering. He accepts that it exists and admits that even though the tragic loss of Alaska created his own labyrinth of suffering, he continues to have faith in the \"Great Perhaps,'\" meaning that Pudge must search for meaning in his life through inevitable grief and suffering. Literary scholar from the University of Northern British Columbia Barb Dean analyzes Pudge and the Colonel's quest for answers as they venture into finding deeper meaning in life.<ref name=\":2\" /> Because this investigation turns into something that is used to deal with the harsh reality of losing Alaska, it leads to Pudge finding his way through his own personal labyrinth of suffering and finding deeper meaning to his life.<ref name=\":2\">{{cite journal|last1=Dean|first1=Barb|title=The Power of Young Adult Literature to Nourish the Spirit: An Examination of John Green's ''Looking for Alaska''|journal=Literature and Belief|date=2010|volume=30|issue=2|page=31}}</ref>\n\n===Grief===\nWhen Alaska dies unexpectedly, the repercussions in the lives of her friends are significant, especially for Pudge and the Colonel. Barb Dean concludes that it is normal to seek answers about what happened and why.<ref name=\":15\" /> She also points out that in writing ''Looking for Alaska'', John Green wished to dive deeper into the grieving process by asking the question \"how does one rationalize the harshness and messiness of life when one has, through stupid, thoughtless, and very human actions, contributed to that very harshness?\" <ref name=\":15\">{{cite journal|last1=Dean|first1=Barb|title=The Power of Young Adult Literature to Nourish the Spirit: An Examination of John Green's Looking for Alaska|journal=Literature and Belief|date=2010|volume=30|issue=2|page=29}}</ref> Pudge and the Colonel blame themselves for Alaska's death because they do not stop her from driving while intoxicated. Because of this, their grieving process consists of seeking answers surrounding her death since they feel that they are responsible. Ultimately, Miles is able to come to the conclusion that Alaska would forgive him for any fault of his in her death and thus his grief is resolved in a healthy way.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Looking for Alaska|last=Green|first=John|publisher=Dutton Juvenile|year=2005|isbn=978-0-525-47506-4|location=|pages=[https://archive.org/details/lookingforalaska00gree/page/221 221]|url=https://archive.org/details/lookingforalaska00gree/page/221}}</ref>\n\n=== Coming of age ===\nThroughout the book, the events that Miles and other characters experience are typical coming-of-age situations. Book reviews often note this theme, bringing up the instances in the book such as grief that cause the characters to look at life from a new and more mature perspective.<ref>Barkdoll, Jayme K., and Lisa Scherff. \"\"Literature is Not a Cold, Dead Place\": An Interview with John Green.\" ''English Journal'' 97.3 (2008): 67-71. ''ProQuest Central, Research Library.'' Web.</ref> Reviews also mention that the characters themselves resemble coming-of-age figures as they are relatable to readers going through similar experiences.<ref name=\"Heryani 136\"/>  Barb Dean also concludes that the characters grow up faster than expected while investigating Alaska's death because exploring the concept of the labyrinth of suffering is Miles' \"rite of passage\" into adulthood, and he learns more about himself through grieving for Alaska.<ref name=\":2\" /> Reviews also note activities such as drinking and smoking, which, though controversial, are often viewed as rites of passage by the teenagers in this novel.<ref name=\":3\">Ritchie, John. \"Looking for Alaska.\" ''ALAN Review'' 32.3 (2005): 36. ''ProQuest Central.'' Web.</ref>\n\n===Hope===\nThe theme of hope plays a major role in ''Looking for Alaska''. Even though some of the novel's prominent themes are about death, grief and loss, Green ties hope into the end of the novel to solve Pudge's internal conflict that is incited by Alaska's death. In Barb Dean's chapter about the novel, she takes a closer look into Mr. Hyde's theology class where he discusses the similarity of the idea of hope between the founding figures of Christianity, Islam, and Buddhism.<ref name=\":2\" /> Mr. Hyde also asks the class what their call for hope is, and Pudge decides his is his escape of his personal labyrinth of suffering. For Pudge, his call for hope is understanding the reality of suffering while also acknowledging that things like friendship and forgiveness can help diminish this suffering.

In May 2012, Sumner County in Tennessee also banned the teaching of ''Looking for Alaska''. The school's spokesman argued that two pages of the novel included enough explicit content to ban the novel.\n\n==== Depew High School, Buffalo, New York ====\nTwo teachers at [[Depew Union Free School District|Depew High School]] near [[Buffalo, New York]], used the book for eleventh grade instruction in 2008. ''Looking for Alaska'' was challenged by parents for its sexual content and moral disagreements with the novel. Despite the teachers providing an alternate book, parents still argued for it to be removed from curriculum due to its inappropriate content such as offensive language, sexually explicit content, including a scene described as \"pornographic\", and references to homosexuality, drugs, alcohol, and smoking. The book was ultimately kept in the curriculum by the school board after a unanimous school board vote with the stipulation that the teachers of the 11th grade class give the parents a decision to have their children read an alternate book. ''Looking for Alaska'' was defended by the school district because they felt it dealt with themes relevant to students of this age, such as death, drinking and driving, and peer pressure.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://infoweb.newsbank.com/resources/doc/nb/news/11EC3D5A88D1F710?p=AWNB|title=Committee will review controversial teenage book - Board will then decide if novel can be textbook|last1=Winchester|first1=Laura E.|website=The Buffalo news|accessdate=7 December 2017}}</ref>\n\n==== Controversy due to cover design ====\nFurther controversy came from the cover art. In August 2012, Green acknowledged that the extinguished candle on the cover leads to \"an improbable amount of smoke\", and explained that the initial cover design did not feature the candle. Green said that certain book chains were uncomfortable with displaying or selling a book with a cover that featured cigarette smoke, so the candle was added beneath the smoke.<ref>{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=coAa_HtrmNk|title=In Which the Candle Dies|date=28 August 2012|accessdate=14 May 2015|work=YouTube}}</ref> In Green's box set, released on October 25, 2012, the candle has been removed from the cover. Further paperback releases of the book also have the candle removed.\n\n==== West Ada School District, Idaho ====\nIn 2016, the [[West Ada School District]] in [[Meridian, Idaho]] removed ''Looking for Alaska'' from all of its middle school libraries.<ref name=\":6\">{{Cite journal|last=Stone|first=David R.|date=2018-07-06|title=Censorship Dateline|journal=Journal of Intellectual Freedom & Privacy|volume=3|issue=1|pages=24|doi=10.5860/jifp.v3i1.6740|issn=2474-7459}}</ref> The school district found the content of the book to be too inappropriate for middle school students. The school district originally received a complaint from a parent on the grounds of the presence of foul language and mentions of actions like smoking and suicide. The district librarian looked into parental complaints along with reviews of the novel suggesting that it was best suited for high schoolers and made the decision to pull the book from the middle school library.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\n==== Marion County, Kentucky ====\nIn 2016 in [[Marion County, Kentucky]], parents urged schools to drop it from the curriculum, referring to it as influencing students \"to experiment with pornography, sex, drugs, alcohol and profanity.\"<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/apr/28/battle-keep-looking-for-alaska-kentucky-school-curriculum-john-green-ya|title=US battle over banning Looking for Alaska continues in Kentucky|last=Flood|first=Alison|date=2016-04-28|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-10-26|issn=0261-3077}}</ref> Although the teacher offered an opt-out book for the class, one parent still felt as though the book should be banned entirely and filed a formal complaint. After the challenge, students were given an alternate book for any parents who were not comfortable with their children reading the book. One parent still insisted on getting the book banned and filed a Request for Reconsideration on the basis that ''Looking for Alaska'' would tempt students to experiment with drugs, alcohol, and sex despite the decisions made after the challenge.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://infoweb.newsbank.com/resources/doc/nb/news/15CBB52D43D0E208?p=AWNB|title=The heart of education - Students need opportunities to think through situations for themselves|website=Lebanon Enterprise (KY)|publisher=NewsBank|url-access=subscription|accessdate=6 December 2017}}</ref>\n\n=== Author's response to controversy ===\nGreen defended his book in his [[vlog]], [[Vlogbrothers]]. The video, entitled \"I Am Not A Pornographer\", describes the Depew High School challenge of ''Looking for Alaska'' and his frustration at the description of his novel as pornography. Green explains the inclusion of the oral sex scene in ''Looking for Alaska'' stating, \"The whole reason that scene in question exists in ''Looking for Alaska'' is because I wanted to draw a contrast between that scene, when there is a lot of physical intimacy, but it is ultimately very emotionally empty, and the scene that immediately follows it, when there is not a serious physical interaction, but there's this intense emotional connection.\" Green argues that the misunderstanding of his book is the reason for its controversy, and urges people to understand the actual literary content before judging specific scenes. He also disagrees with the way that groups of parents underestimate the intelligence of teenagers and their ability to analyze literature. He ends with encouraging his viewers to attend the Depew School Board hearing to support the choice of parents, students, and teachers to have ''Looking for Alaska'' included in public schools.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHMPtYvZ8tM|title=I Am Not A Pornographer|last1=Green|first1=John|website=YouTube|accessdate=7 December 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Adaptation==\n{{main|Looking for Alaska (TV series)}}\nThe film rights to the novel were acquired by [[Paramount Pictures]] in 2005.

He also noted that his inspiration for the possessed swan in Culver Creek derived from a similar swan he remembers at Indian Springs. The two pranks that occur in the book are similar to pranks that Green pulled at school, but Green emphasizes that while the setting is based on his life, the novel is entirely fictional.<ref>{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JLuF8GmtH4|title=John Green's Legendary High School Prank|date=8 December 2007|work=YouTube|accessdate=3 November 2019}}</ref>\n\nAs a child, Green became infatuated with famous last words, specifically those of [[John Adams]].

However, Alaska later admits that she told on both Marya and Paul to the dean, Mr. Starnes, to save herself from being expelled.\n\nThe gang celebrates a successful series of pranks by drinking and partying, and an inebriated Alaska confides about her mother's death from an [[aneurysm]] when she was eight years old. Although she didn't understand at the time, she feels guilty for not calling 911. Pudge figures that her mother's death made Alaska impulsive and rash. He concludes that the labyrinth was a person's suffering and that humans must try to find their way out. Afterwards, Pudge grows closer to Lara, and they start dating. A week later, after another 'celebration', an intoxicated Alaska and Pudge spend the night with each other, when suddenly Alaska receives a phone call which causes her to go into hysterics. Insisting that she has to leave, Alaska drives away while drunk with Pudge and the Colonel distracting Mr. Starnes. They later learn that Alaska was [[driving under the influence|DUI]] and died.\n\nThe Colonel and Pudge are devastated and blame themselves, wondering about her reasons for undertaking the urgent drive and even contemplating that she might have deliberately killed herself. The Colonel insists on questioning Jake, her boyfriend, but Pudge refuses, fearing that he might learn that Alaska never loved him. They argue and the Colonel accuses Pudge of only loving an idealized Alaska that Pudge made up in his head. Pudge realizes the truth of this and reconciles with the Colonel.\n\nAs a way of celebrating Alaska's life, Pudge, the Colonel, Takumi, and Lara team up with the Weekday Warriors to hire a male stripper to speak at Culver's Speaker Day. The whole school finds it hilarious; Mr. Starnes even acknowledges how clever it was. Pudge finds Alaska's copy of ''[[The General in His Labyrinth]]'' with the labyrinth quote underlined and notices the words \"straight and fast\" written in the margins. He remembers Alaska died on the morning after the anniversary of her mother's death and concludes that Alaska felt guilty for not visiting her mother's grave and, in her rush, might have been trying to reach the cemetery. On the last day of school, Takumi confesses in a note that he was the last person to see Alaska, and he let her go as well. Pudge realizes that letting her go doesn't matter as much anymore. He forgives Alaska for dying, as he knows Alaska forgives him for letting her go.\n\n== Style ==\n''Looking for Alaska'' is divided into two halves and narrated by main character Miles Halter. Rather than the typical numerical system, each chapter is denoted through the number of days before Alaska's death or the number of days after. The genesis of this structure resulted from John Green's influence of public reactions to the events on [[September 11 attacks|September 11, 2001.]] <ref name=\":33\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/292717/looking-for-alaska-by-john-green/9780593109069|title=Looking for Alaska by John Green - Reading Guide: 9780593109069 - PenguinRandomHouse.com: Books|website=PenguinRandomhouse.com|language=en-US|access-date=2019-12-09}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/childrens/childrens-authors/article/65089-john-green-celebrates-10-years-of-looking-for-alaska.html|title=John Green Celebrates 10 Years of 'Looking for Alaska'|last=Maughan|first=Shannon|date=2014|website=Publisher's Weekly|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> In an interview with [[Random House|Random House Publishing]], Green recalled that newscasters stated that people would now view the world through the lens of either before or after 9/11.<ref name=\":33\"/> Green says in the same interview, \u201cWe look back to the most important moment in our history, and that becomes the dividing line between what we were and what we are now.

While looking for answers, the boys are subconsciously dealing with their grief, and their obsession with finding answers transforms into a search for meaning. Pudge and Colonel want to find out the answers to certain questions surrounding Alaska's death, but in reality, they are enduring their own labyrinths of suffering, a concept central to the novel. When their theology teacher Mr. Hyde poses a question to his class about the meaning of life, Pudge takes this opportunity to write about it as a labyrinth of suffering. He accepts that it exists and admits that even though the tragic loss of Alaska created his own labyrinth of suffering, he continues to have faith in the \"Great Perhaps,'\" meaning that Pudge must search for meaning in his life through inevitable grief and suffering. Literary scholar from the University of Northern British Columbia Barb Dean analyzes Pudge and the Colonel's quest for answers as they venture into finding deeper meaning in life.<ref name=\":2\" /> Because this investigation turns into something that is used to deal with the harsh reality of losing Alaska, it leads to Pudge finding his way through his own personal labyrinth of suffering and finding deeper meaning to his life.<ref name=\":2\">{{cite journal|last1=Dean|first1=Barb|title=The Power of Young Adult Literature to Nourish the Spirit: An Examination of John Green's ''Looking for Alaska''|journal=Literature and Belief|date=2010|volume=30|issue=2|page=31}}</ref>\n\n===Grief===\nWhen Alaska dies unexpectedly, the repercussions in the lives of her friends are significant, especially for Pudge and the Colonel. Barb Dean concludes that it is normal to seek answers about what happened and why.<ref name=\":15\" /> She also points out that in writing ''Looking for Alaska'', John Green wished to dive deeper into the grieving process by asking the question \"how does one rationalize the harshness and messiness of life when one has, through stupid, thoughtless, and very human actions, contributed to that very harshness?\" <ref name=\":15\">{{cite journal|last1=Dean|first1=Barb|title=The Power of Young Adult Literature to Nourish the Spirit: An Examination of John Green's Looking for Alaska|journal=Literature and Belief|date=2010|volume=30|issue=2|page=29}}</ref> Pudge and the Colonel blame themselves for Alaska's death because they do not stop her from driving while intoxicated. Because of this, their grieving process consists of seeking answers surrounding her death since they feel that they are responsible. Ultimately, Miles is able to come to the conclusion that Alaska would forgive him for any fault of his in her death and thus his grief is resolved in a healthy way.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Looking for Alaska|last=Green|first=John|publisher=Dutton Juvenile|year=2005|isbn=978-0-525-47506-4|location=|pages=[https://archive.org/details/lookingforalaska00gree/page/221 221]|url=https://archive.org/details/lookingforalaska00gree/page/221}}</ref>\n\n=== Coming of age ===\nThroughout the book, the events that Miles and other characters experience are typical coming-of-age situations. Book reviews often note this theme, bringing up the instances in the book such as grief that cause the characters to look at life from a new and more mature perspective.<ref>Barkdoll, Jayme K., and Lisa Scherff. \"\"Literature is Not a Cold, Dead Place\": An Interview with John Green.\" ''English Journal'' 97.3 (2008): 67-71. ''ProQuest Central, Research Library.'' Web.</ref> Reviews also mention that the characters themselves resemble coming-of-age figures as they are relatable to readers going through similar experiences.<ref name=\"Heryani 136\"/>  Barb Dean also concludes that the characters grow up faster than expected while investigating Alaska's death because exploring the concept of the labyrinth of suffering is Miles' \"rite of passage\" into adulthood, and he learns more about himself through grieving for Alaska.<ref name=\":2\" /> Reviews also note activities such as drinking and smoking, which, though controversial, are often viewed as rites of passage by the teenagers in this novel.<ref name=\":3\">Ritchie, John. \"Looking for Alaska.\" ''ALAN Review'' 32.3 (2005): 36. ''ProQuest Central.'' Web.</ref>\n\n===Hope===\nThe theme of hope plays a major role in ''Looking for Alaska''. Even though some of the novel's prominent themes are about death, grief and loss, Green ties hope into the end of the novel to solve Pudge's internal conflict that is incited by Alaska's death. In Barb Dean's chapter about the novel, she takes a closer look into Mr. Hyde's theology class where he discusses the similarity of the idea of hope between the founding figures of Christianity, Islam, and Buddhism.<ref name=\":2\" /> Mr. Hyde also asks the class what their call for hope is, and Pudge decides his is his escape of his personal labyrinth of suffering. For Pudge, his call for hope is understanding the reality of suffering while also acknowledging that things like friendship and forgiveness can help diminish this suffering. Dean notes that Green has said that he writes fiction in order to \"'keep that fragile strand of radical hope [alive], to build a fire in the darkness.'\" <ref name=\"Dean Article\">{{cite journal|last1=Dean|first1=Barb|title=The Power of Young Adult Literature to Nourish the Spirit: An Examination of John Green's ''Looking for Alaska''|journal=Literature and Belief|date=2010|volume=30|issue=2|pages=32\u201333}}</ref>\n\n=== Youth-adult relationships ===\n''Looking for Alaska'' is a novel that exposes readers to the interpersonal relationships between the youth and adult characters in the novel. Green presents specific adult characters, like The Eagle who is the dean of students, whose main focus is to eliminate the rebellious tendencies of various students.<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite document|title=Reaching Reluctant Readers (Aka Books for Boys)|last=Jeffery|first=Dwayne|id = {{ProQuest|212246506}}}}</ref> On the contrary, certain characters, like Dr. Hyde, the school's religious studies teacher, express positive beliefs in his students, while still maintaining an authoritative role within the classroom environment. The relationship that exists between Dr. Hyde and his students' illustrates how mutual respect can lead to positive interpersonal relationships between the youth and adults.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n== Reception ==\n''Looking for Alaska'' has received both positive reviews and attempts at censorship in multiple school districts. Positive reviews include comments on the relatable high school characters and situations as well as more complex ideas such as how topics like grief are handled.<ref name=\":11\">{{Cite journal|last=Lewis|first=Mark A.|last2=Petrone|first2=Robert|date=2010|title=\"Although Adolescence Need Not Be Violent...\": Preservice Teachers' Connections between \"Adolescence\" and Literacy Curriculum|journal=Journal of Adolescent & Adult Literacy|volume=53|issue=5|pages=398\u2013407|issn=1081-3004|jstor=25614573|doi=10.1598/JAAL.53.5.5|url=https://scholarworks.montana.edu/xmlui/handle/1/9557}}</ref> Overall, many reviewers agree that this is a coming-of-age story that is appealing to both older and younger readers.<ref name=\":12\">Gallo, Don. \"The very Best Possibilities, Part Two.\" ''English Journal'' 95.5 (2006): 107-10.

In May 2012, Sumner County in Tennessee also banned the teaching of ''Looking for Alaska''. The school's spokesman argued that two pages of the novel included enough explicit content to ban the novel.\n\n==== Depew High School, Buffalo, New York ====\nTwo teachers at [[Depew Union Free School District|Depew High School]] near [[Buffalo, New York]], used the book for eleventh grade instruction in 2008. ''Looking for Alaska'' was challenged by parents for its sexual content and moral disagreements with the novel. Despite the teachers providing an alternate book, parents still argued for it to be removed from curriculum due to its inappropriate content such as offensive language, sexually explicit content, including a scene described as \"pornographic\", and references to homosexuality, drugs, alcohol, and smoking. The book was ultimately kept in the curriculum by the school board after a unanimous school board vote with the stipulation that the teachers of the 11th grade class give the parents a decision to have their children read an alternate book. ''Looking for Alaska'' was defended by the school district because they felt it dealt with themes relevant to students of this age, such as death, drinking and driving, and peer pressure.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://infoweb.newsbank.com/resources/doc/nb/news/11EC3D5A88D1F710?p=AWNB|title=Committee will review controversial teenage book - Board will then decide if novel can be textbook|last1=Winchester|first1=Laura E.|website=The Buffalo news|accessdate=7 December 2017}}</ref>\n\n==== Controversy due to cover design ====\nFurther controversy came from the cover art. In August 2012, Green acknowledged that the extinguished candle on the cover leads to \"an improbable amount of smoke\", and explained that the initial cover design did not feature the candle. Green said that certain book chains were uncomfortable with displaying or selling a book with a cover that featured cigarette smoke, so the candle was added beneath the smoke.<ref>{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=coAa_HtrmNk|title=In Which the Candle Dies|date=28 August 2012|accessdate=14 May 2015|work=YouTube}}</ref> In Green's box set, released on October 25, 2012, the candle has been removed from the cover. Further paperback releases of the book also have the candle removed.\n\n==== West Ada School District, Idaho ====\nIn 2016, the [[West Ada School District]] in [[Meridian, Idaho]] removed ''Looking for Alaska'' from all of its middle school libraries.<ref name=\":6\">{{Cite journal|last=Stone|first=David R.|date=2018-07-06|title=Censorship Dateline|journal=Journal of Intellectual Freedom & Privacy|volume=3|issue=1|pages=24|doi=10.5860/jifp.v3i1.6740|issn=2474-7459}}</ref> The school district found the content of the book to be too inappropriate for middle school students. The school district originally received a complaint from a parent on the grounds of the presence of foul language and mentions of actions like smoking and suicide. The district librarian looked into parental complaints along with reviews of the novel suggesting that it was best suited for high schoolers and made the decision to pull the book from the middle school library.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\n==== Marion County, Kentucky ====\nIn 2016 in [[Marion County, Kentucky]], parents urged schools to drop it from the curriculum, referring to it as influencing students \"to experiment with pornography, sex, drugs, alcohol and profanity.\"<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/apr/28/battle-keep-looking-for-alaska-kentucky-school-curriculum-john-green-ya|title=US battle over banning Looking for Alaska continues in Kentucky|last=Flood|first=Alison|date=2016-04-28|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-10-26|issn=0261-3077}}</ref> Although the teacher offered an opt-out book for the class, one parent still felt as though the book should be banned entirely and filed a formal complaint. After the challenge, students were given an alternate book for any parents who were not comfortable with their children reading the book. One parent still insisted on getting the book banned and filed a Request for Reconsideration on the basis that ''Looking for Alaska'' would tempt students to experiment with drugs, alcohol, and sex despite the decisions made after the challenge.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://infoweb.newsbank.com/resources/doc/nb/news/15CBB52D43D0E208?p=AWNB|title=The heart of education - Students need opportunities to think through situations for themselves|website=Lebanon Enterprise (KY)|publisher=NewsBank|url-access=subscription|accessdate=6 December 2017}}</ref>\n\n=== Author's response to controversy ===\nGreen defended his book in his [[vlog]], [[Vlogbrothers]]. The video, entitled \"I Am Not A Pornographer\", describes the Depew High School challenge of ''Looking for Alaska'' and his frustration at the description of his novel as pornography. Green explains the inclusion of the oral sex scene in ''Looking for Alaska'' stating, \"The whole reason that scene in question exists in ''Looking for Alaska'' is because I wanted to draw a contrast between that scene, when there is a lot of physical intimacy, but it is ultimately very emotionally empty, and the scene that immediately follows it, when there is not a serious physical interaction, but there's this intense emotional connection.\" Green argues that the misunderstanding of his book is the reason for its controversy, and urges people to understand the actual literary content before judging specific scenes. He also disagrees with the way that groups of parents underestimate the intelligence of teenagers and their ability to analyze literature. He ends with encouraging his viewers to attend the Depew School Board hearing to support the choice of parents, students, and teachers to have ''Looking for Alaska'' included in public schools.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHMPtYvZ8tM|title=I Am Not A Pornographer|last1=Green|first1=John|website=YouTube|accessdate=7 December 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Adaptation==\n{{main|Looking for Alaska (TV series)}}\nThe film rights to the novel were acquired by [[Paramount Pictures]] in 2005.

The plot displays many classic elements of [[farce]], including puns, the slamming of doors, cases of [[mistaken identity]] (frequently involving characters disguising themselves as one another), and satirical comments on social class. The title derives from a line often used by [[vaudeville]] comedians to begin a story: \"A funny thing happened on the way to the theater\".\n\nThe musical's original 1962 [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] run won several [[Tony Award]]s, including Best Musical and Best Author (Musical). ''A Funny Thing'' has enjoyed several Broadway and [[West End theatre|West End]] revivals and was made into a successful [[A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum (film)|film]] starring the original lead of the stage musical, [[Zero Mostel]].\n\n==Productions==\n\n===Original Broadway===\n''A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum'' opened on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] on May 8, 1962, at the [[Neil Simon Theatre|Alvin Theatre]], and then transferred to the [[Mark Hellinger Theatre]] and the [[Majestic Theatre (Broadway)|Majestic Theatre]], where the show closed on August 29, 1964, after 964 performances and 8 previews.\n\nThe show's creators originally wanted [[Phil Silvers]] in the lead role of [[Pseudolus]], but he turned them down, allegedly because he would have to perform onstage without his glasses, and his vision was so poor that he feared tripping into the orchestra pit. He is also quoted as turning down the role for being \"[[The Phil Silvers Show|Sgt. Bilko]] in a toga\". (Silvers eventually played the role \u2014 wearing his glasses \u2014 in a 1972 revival. In the film, he played Marcus Lycus.) [[Milton Berle]] also passed on the role. Eventually, Zero Mostel was cast.<ref name=green>Green, Stanley and Green, Kay.[https://books.google.com/books?id=KDKFHniTy1YC&lpg=PA198 \"A Funny Thing Happened on the Way To the Forum\"] ''Broadway Musicals, Show By Show'' (1996),  Hal Leonard Corporation, {{ISBN|0-7935-7750-0}}, p. 198</ref>\n\nDuring the out of town pre-Broadway tryouts the show was attracting little business and not playing well. [[Jerome Robbins]] was called in to give advice and make changes. The biggest change Robbins made was a new opening number to replace \"Love Is in the Air\" and introduce the show as a bawdy, wild comedy. Stephen Sondheim wrote the song \"Comedy Tonight\" for this new opening.<ref name=green /> From that point on, the show was a success.\n\nIt was directed by [[George Abbott]] and produced by [[Hal Prince]], with choreography by [[Jack Cole (choreographer)|Jack Cole]] and uncredited staging and choreography by Robbins. The scenic and costume design was by [[Tony Walton]]. This wardrobe is on display at the Costume World Broadway Collection in Pompano Beach, Florida. The lighting design was by [[Jean Rosenthal]]. Along with Mostel, the musical featured a cast of seasoned performers, including [[Jack Gilford]] (Mostel's friend and fellow blacklist member), [[David Burns (actor)|David Burns]], [[John Carradine]], [[Ruth Kobart]], and [[Raymond Walburn]]. The young lovers were played by Brian Davies and Preshy Marker. [[Karen Black]], originally cast as the ingenue, was replaced out of town.\n\nThe show won several [[Tony Award]]s: Best Musical, Best Actor, Best Supporting Actor (Burns), Best Book, and Best Director. The score, however, was coolly received; it was Sondheim's first musical on Broadway in which he wrote both the music and lyrics, and did not earn a nomination for Best Original Score.\n\n===London===\nThe show was presented twice in London's [[West End theatre|West End]].

In the center is the house of Senex, who lives there with wife Domina, son Hero, and several slaves, including head slave Hysterium and the musical's main character Pseudolus. A slave belonging to Hero, Pseudolus wishes to buy, win, or steal his freedom. One of the neighboring houses is owned by Marcus Lycus, who is a buyer and seller of beautiful women; the other belongs to the ancient Erronius, who is abroad searching for his long-lost children (stolen in infancy by pirates).\n\nOne day, Senex and Domina depart on a visit to Domina's mother and leave Pseudolus in charge of Hero. Hero confides in Pseudolus that he is in love with the lovely Philia, one of the courtesans in the House of Lycus (albeit still a virgin). Pseudolus promises to help him win Philia's love in exchange for his own freedom. Unfortunately (as the two find out when they pay a visit on Lycus), Philia has been sold to the renowned warrior [[Miles Gloriosus]], who is expected to claim her very soon.  Pseudolus, an excellent liar, uses Philia's cheery disposition to convince Lycus that she has picked up a [[Yersinia pestis|plague]] from [[Crete]], which causes its victims to smile endlessly in its terminal stages. By offering to isolate her in Senex's house, he is able to give Philia and Hero some time alone together, and the two fall in love. But Philia insists that, even though she is in love with Hero, she must honor her contract with the Captain, for \"that is the way of a courtesan.\" To appease her, he tells her to wait (\"that's what virgins do best, isn't it?\") inside, and that he will have the captain knock three times when he arrives. Pseudolus comes up with a plan to slip Philia a sleeping potion that will render her unconscious. He will then tell Lycus that she has died of the Cretan plague, and will offer to remove the body. Hero will come along, and they will stow away on a ship headed for Greece. Satisfied with his plan, Pseudolus steals Hysterium's book of potions and has Hero read him the recipe for the sleeping potion; the only ingredient he lacks is \"mare's sweat\", and Pseudolus goes off in search of some.\n\nUnexpectedly, Senex returns home early from his trip, and knocks three times on his own door. Philia comes out of the house, and, thinking that Senex is the Captain, offers herself up to him. Surprised but game, Senex instructs Philia to wait in the house for him, and she does. Hysterium arrives to this confusion, and tells Senex that Philia is the new maid that he has hired. Pseudolus returns, having procured the necessary mare's sweat; seeing that Senex has returned unexpectedly and grasping the need to keep him out of the way, Pseudolus discreetly sprinkles some of the horse-sweat onto him, then suggests that the road trip has left Senex in dire need of a bath. Taking the bait, Senex instructs Hysterium to draw him a bath in the long-abandoned house of Erronius. But while this is happening, Erronius returns home, finally having given up the search for his long-lost children. Hysterium, desperate to keep him out of the house where his master is bathing, tells the old man that his house has become haunted \u2013 a story seemingly confirmed by the sound of Senex singing in his bath. Erronius immediately determines to have a soothsayer come and banish the spirit from his house, and Pseudolus obligingly poses as one, telling Erronius that, in order to banish the spirit, he must travel seven times around the seven hills of Rome (thus keeping the old man occupied and out of the way for quite a while).\n\nWhen Miles Gloriosus arrives to claim his courtesan-bride, Pseudolus hides Philia on the roof of Senex's house; told that she has \"escaped,\" Lycus is terrified to face the Captain's wrath. Pseudolus offers to impersonate Lycus and talk his way out of the mess but, his ingenuity flagging, he ends up merely telling the Captain that Philia has disappeared, and that he, \"Lycus\", will search for her. Displeased and suspicious, Miles insists that his soldiers accompany Pseudolus, but the wily slave loses them in Rome's winding streets.\n\nComplicating matters further, Domina returns from her trip early, suspicious that her husband Senex is \"up to something low.\" She disguises herself in virginal white robes and a veil (much like Philia's) to try to catch Senex being unfaithful. Pseudolus convinces Hysterium to help him by dressing in [[Drag (clothing)|drag]] and pretending to be Philia, \"dead\" from the plague. Unfortunately, it turns out that Miles Gloriosus has just returned from Crete, where there is of course no actual plague. With the ruse thus revealed, the main characters run for their lives, resulting in a madcap chase across the stage with both Miles and Senex pursuing all three \"Philia\"s (Domina, Hysterium, and the actual Philia \u2013 all wearing identical white robes and veils). Meanwhile, the courtesans from the house of Marcus Lycus &ndash; who had been recruited as mourners at \"Philia\"'s ersatz funeral &ndash; have escaped, and Lycus sends his [[Eunuch (court official)|eunuch]]s out to bring them all back, adding to the general pandemonium.\n\nFinally, the Captain's troops are able to round everyone up. His plot thoroughly unraveled, Pseudolus appears to be in deep trouble \u2013 but Erronius, completing his third circuit of the Roman hills, shows up fortuitously to discover that Miles Gloriosus and Philia are wearing matching rings which mark them as his long-lost children. Philia's betrothal to the Captain is nullified by the unexpected revelation that he's her brother, and, as the daughter of a free-born citizen, she's freed from Marcus Lycus. Philia weds Hero; Pseudolus gets his freedom and the lovely courtesan Gymnasia; Gloriosus receives twin courtesans to replace Philia; and Erronius is reunited with his children. A happy ending prevails for all \u2013 except for poor Senex, stuck with his shrewish wife Domina.\n\n==Characters==\n*'''[[Pseudolus]]''': A Roman slave, owned by Hero, who seeks to win freedom by helping Hero win the heart of Philia.  The name ''Pseudolus''  means \"Faker\". While originally written as a male role, it has been performed by female actors as well.\n*'''Hero''': Young son of Senex who falls in love with the virgin, Philia.\n*'''Philia''': (Greek for \"love\") A virgin in the house of Marcus Lycus, and Hero's love interest. Her name is also a homophone of the Latin word \"Filia,\" which means daughter. This foreshadows her status as the daughter of Erronius.\n* '''Hysterium''': (Latin for \"Hysterical\", or \"Anxious\", the suffix \"-um\" makes the name neuter, and the character's gender is often mistaken throughout the piece) The chief slave in the house of Senex.\n*'''[[Senex]]''': (Latin for \"old man\") A henpecked, sardonic [[Senate of the Roman Republic|Roman senator]] living in a less fashionable suburb of Rome.\n*'''Domina''': (Latin for \"mistress\") The wife of Senex. A manipulative, shrewish woman loathed by her husband.\n*'''Marcus Lycus''': A purveyor of courtesans, who operates from the house to the left of Senex. (Name based on Lycus, the prostitute in [[Plautus]]'s ''Poenulus''.)\n*'''[[Miles Gloriosus]]''': (Latin for \"boastful soldier,\" the archetype of the braggart soldier in Roman comedies) A captain in the Roman army to whom Marcus Lycus has promised Philia.\n*'''Erronius''': (Latin for \"wandering\") Senex's elderly neighbor in the house to the right. He has spent the past twenty years searching for his two children, kidnapped in infancy by pirates.\n*'''Gymnasia''': (Greek for \"Athletic\", with the connotation of nakedness) A courtesan from the house of Lycus with whom Pseudolus falls in love.\n*'''Tintinabula''': (Latin for \"Bells\") A jingling, bell-wearing courtesan in the house of Lycus.\n*'''Vibrata''': (Latin for \"Vibrant\") A wild, vibrant courtesan in the house of Lycus.\n*'''Geminae''': (Latin for \"Twins\") Twin courtesans in the house of Lycus.\n*'''Panacea''': (Greek for \"Cure All\") A courtesan in the house of Lycus.\n*'''Proteans''': Choristers who play multiple roles (slaves, citizens, soldiers, and eunuchs). They accompany Pseudolus in \"Comedy Tonight\". On Broadway, three people played all of these roles.\n\n==Cast==\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:100%;\"\n|-\n!

The plot displays many classic elements of [[farce]], including puns, the slamming of doors, cases of [[mistaken identity]] (frequently involving characters disguising themselves as one another), and satirical comments on social class. The title derives from a line often used by [[vaudeville]] comedians to begin a story: \"A funny thing happened on the way to the theater\".\n\nThe musical's original 1962 [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] run won several [[Tony Award]]s, including Best Musical and Best Author (Musical). ''A Funny Thing'' has enjoyed several Broadway and [[West End theatre|West End]] revivals and was made into a successful [[A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum (film)|film]] starring the original lead of the stage musical, [[Zero Mostel]].\n\n==Productions==\n\n===Original Broadway===\n''A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum'' opened on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] on May 8, 1962, at the [[Neil Simon Theatre|Alvin Theatre]], and then transferred to the [[Mark Hellinger Theatre]] and the [[Majestic Theatre (Broadway)|Majestic Theatre]], where the show closed on August 29, 1964, after 964 performances and 8 previews.\n\nThe show's creators originally wanted [[Phil Silvers]] in the lead role of [[Pseudolus]], but he turned them down, allegedly because he would have to perform onstage without his glasses, and his vision was so poor that he feared tripping into the orchestra pit. He is also quoted as turning down the role for being \"[[The Phil Silvers Show|Sgt. Bilko]] in a toga\". (Silvers eventually played the role \u2014 wearing his glasses \u2014 in a 1972 revival. In the film, he played Marcus Lycus.) [[Milton Berle]] also passed on the role. Eventually, Zero Mostel was cast.<ref name=green>Green, Stanley and Green, Kay.[https://books.google.com/books?id=KDKFHniTy1YC&lpg=PA198 \"A Funny Thing Happened on the Way To the Forum\"] ''Broadway Musicals, Show By Show'' (1996),  Hal Leonard Corporation, {{ISBN|0-7935-7750-0}}, p. 198</ref>\n\nDuring the out of town pre-Broadway tryouts the show was attracting little business and not playing well. [[Jerome Robbins]] was called in to give advice and make changes. The biggest change Robbins made was a new opening number to replace \"Love Is in the Air\" and introduce the show as a bawdy, wild comedy. Stephen Sondheim wrote the song \"Comedy Tonight\" for this new opening.<ref name=green /> From that point on, the show was a success.\n\nIt was directed by [[George Abbott]] and produced by [[Hal Prince]], with choreography by [[Jack Cole (choreographer)|Jack Cole]] and uncredited staging and choreography by Robbins. The scenic and costume design was by [[Tony Walton]]. This wardrobe is on display at the Costume World Broadway Collection in Pompano Beach, Florida. The lighting design was by [[Jean Rosenthal]]. Along with Mostel, the musical featured a cast of seasoned performers, including [[Jack Gilford]] (Mostel's friend and fellow blacklist member), [[David Burns (actor)|David Burns]], [[John Carradine]], [[Ruth Kobart]], and [[Raymond Walburn]]. The young lovers were played by Brian Davies and Preshy Marker. [[Karen Black]], originally cast as the ingenue, was replaced out of town.\n\nThe show won several [[Tony Award]]s: Best Musical, Best Actor, Best Supporting Actor (Burns), Best Book, and Best Director. The score, however, was coolly received; it was Sondheim's first musical on Broadway in which he wrote both the music and lyrics, and did not earn a nomination for Best Original Score.\n\n===London===\nThe show was presented twice in London's [[West End theatre|West End]]. The 1963 production and its 1986 revival were staged at the [[Novello Theatre|Strand Theatre]] and the [[Piccadilly Theatre]] respectively,<ref>[http://www.guidetomusicaltheatre.com/london_shows_chronology/1963.htm \"Listing, 1963 production\"] Guidetomusicaltheatre.com, retrieved December 9, 2009</ref><ref>[http://www.thisistheatre.com/shows/piccadilly111.html \"Listing, 1986 production\"] Thisistheatre.com, retrieved December 9, 2009</ref> and starred [[Frankie Howerd]] as Pseudolus and [[Leon Greene]] as Miles Gloriosus in both. In the 1963 production, [[Kenneth Connor]] appeared as Hysterium, [['Monsewer' Eddie Gray]] as [[Senex]], [[Jon Pertwee]] as Marcus Lycus, and [[Leon Greene]] as Miles Gloriosus. In the 1986 revival, [[Patrick Cargill]] was Senex with [[Ronnie Stevens (actor)|Ronnie Stevens]] as Hysterium and [[Derek Royle]] as Erronius.\n\nIn 2004 there was a limited-run revival at the [[Royal National Theatre]], starring [[Desmond Barrit]] as Pseudolus, [[Philip Quast]] as Miles Gloriosus, [[Hamish McColl]] as Hysterium and [[Isla Blair]] as Domina (who had previously played Philia in the 1963 production).<ref>Inverne, James.

[[David Burns (actor)|David Burns]] did not return for the film role of Senex, which was played in the film by [[Michael Hordern]]. [[Buster Keaton]] made his final film appearance in the role of Erronius.

They had to close soon after Phil Silvers suffered a stroke. The show won two Tony Awards, Best Leading Actor in a Musical for Silvers, and Best Featured Actor in a Musical for Blyden.<ref name=phil/>\n\nThe musical was revived again with great success in 1996, opening at the [[St. James Theatre]] on April 18, 1996 and closing on January 4, 1998 after 715 performances.

Stadlen]] as Senex, and Cris Groenendaal as Miles Gloriosus. The production was directed by [[Jerry Zaks]], with choreography by [[Rob Marshall]].

In the center is the house of Senex, who lives there with wife Domina, son Hero, and several slaves, including head slave Hysterium and the musical's main character Pseudolus. A slave belonging to Hero, Pseudolus wishes to buy, win, or steal his freedom. One of the neighboring houses is owned by Marcus Lycus, who is a buyer and seller of beautiful women; the other belongs to the ancient Erronius, who is abroad searching for his long-lost children (stolen in infancy by pirates).\n\nOne day, Senex and Domina depart on a visit to Domina's mother and leave Pseudolus in charge of Hero. Hero confides in Pseudolus that he is in love with the lovely Philia, one of the courtesans in the House of Lycus (albeit still a virgin). Pseudolus promises to help him win Philia's love in exchange for his own freedom. Unfortunately (as the two find out when they pay a visit on Lycus), Philia has been sold to the renowned warrior [[Miles Gloriosus]], who is expected to claim her very soon.  Pseudolus, an excellent liar, uses Philia's cheery disposition to convince Lycus that she has picked up a [[Yersinia pestis|plague]] from [[Crete]], which causes its victims to smile endlessly in its terminal stages. By offering to isolate her in Senex's house, he is able to give Philia and Hero some time alone together, and the two fall in love. But Philia insists that, even though she is in love with Hero, she must honor her contract with the Captain, for \"that is the way of a courtesan.\" To appease her, he tells her to wait (\"that's what virgins do best, isn't it?\") inside, and that he will have the captain knock three times when he arrives. Pseudolus comes up with a plan to slip Philia a sleeping potion that will render her unconscious. He will then tell Lycus that she has died of the Cretan plague, and will offer to remove the body. Hero will come along, and they will stow away on a ship headed for Greece. Satisfied with his plan, Pseudolus steals Hysterium's book of potions and has Hero read him the recipe for the sleeping potion; the only ingredient he lacks is \"mare's sweat\", and Pseudolus goes off in search of some.\n\nUnexpectedly, Senex returns home early from his trip, and knocks three times on his own door. Philia comes out of the house, and, thinking that Senex is the Captain, offers herself up to him. Surprised but game, Senex instructs Philia to wait in the house for him, and she does. Hysterium arrives to this confusion, and tells Senex that Philia is the new maid that he has hired. Pseudolus returns, having procured the necessary mare's sweat; seeing that Senex has returned unexpectedly and grasping the need to keep him out of the way, Pseudolus discreetly sprinkles some of the horse-sweat onto him, then suggests that the road trip has left Senex in dire need of a bath. Taking the bait, Senex instructs Hysterium to draw him a bath in the long-abandoned house of Erronius. But while this is happening, Erronius returns home, finally having given up the search for his long-lost children. Hysterium, desperate to keep him out of the house where his master is bathing, tells the old man that his house has become haunted \u2013 a story seemingly confirmed by the sound of Senex singing in his bath. Erronius immediately determines to have a soothsayer come and banish the spirit from his house, and Pseudolus obligingly poses as one, telling Erronius that, in order to banish the spirit, he must travel seven times around the seven hills of Rome (thus keeping the old man occupied and out of the way for quite a while).\n\nWhen Miles Gloriosus arrives to claim his courtesan-bride, Pseudolus hides Philia on the roof of Senex's house; told that she has \"escaped,\" Lycus is terrified to face the Captain's wrath. Pseudolus offers to impersonate Lycus and talk his way out of the mess but, his ingenuity flagging, he ends up merely telling the Captain that Philia has disappeared, and that he, \"Lycus\", will search for her. Displeased and suspicious, Miles insists that his soldiers accompany Pseudolus, but the wily slave loses them in Rome's winding streets.\n\nComplicating matters further, Domina returns from her trip early, suspicious that her husband Senex is \"up to something low.\" She disguises herself in virginal white robes and a veil (much like Philia's) to try to catch Senex being unfaithful. Pseudolus convinces Hysterium to help him by dressing in [[Drag (clothing)|drag]] and pretending to be Philia, \"dead\" from the plague. Unfortunately, it turns out that Miles Gloriosus has just returned from Crete, where there is of course no actual plague. With the ruse thus revealed, the main characters run for their lives, resulting in a madcap chase across the stage with both Miles and Senex pursuing all three \"Philia\"s (Domina, Hysterium, and the actual Philia \u2013 all wearing identical white robes and veils). Meanwhile, the courtesans from the house of Marcus Lycus &ndash; who had been recruited as mourners at \"Philia\"'s ersatz funeral &ndash; have escaped, and Lycus sends his [[Eunuch (court official)|eunuch]]s out to bring them all back, adding to the general pandemonium.\n\nFinally, the Captain's troops are able to round everyone up. His plot thoroughly unraveled, Pseudolus appears to be in deep trouble \u2013 but Erronius, completing his third circuit of the Roman hills, shows up fortuitously to discover that Miles Gloriosus and Philia are wearing matching rings which mark them as his long-lost children. Philia's betrothal to the Captain is nullified by the unexpected revelation that he's her brother, and, as the daughter of a free-born citizen, she's freed from Marcus Lycus. Philia weds Hero; Pseudolus gets his freedom and the lovely courtesan Gymnasia; Gloriosus receives twin courtesans to replace Philia; and Erronius is reunited with his children. A happy ending prevails for all \u2013 except for poor Senex, stuck with his shrewish wife Domina.\n\n==Characters==\n*'''[[Pseudolus]]''': A Roman slave, owned by Hero, who seeks to win freedom by helping Hero win the heart of Philia.

He is known for his landscapes, city views, and seascapes, but also has created genre, portraits and still life works. He is a resident of [[Maryland]], with a studio in [[Washington, D.C.]].\n\n== Biography and Career ==\nAndrei Kushnir was born in Regensburg, Germany, the son of Ukrainian parents who immigrated to the United States to escape Soviet communism. \nHe began painting in oils in 1980 and quickly progressed to painting landscapes on site.  While essentially self-taught, Kushnir studied with artists Michael Francis and Michele Martin Taylor.  He developed his own naturalistic realist style, and has worked primarily outdoors, in every season and type of weather.<ref>\"Artist Andrei Kushnir's Paintings of the C&O Canal,\" Leaves Magazine, Vol. 79, No.5, September/October, 1998, Cover, p. 3 and p. 11; Ann Gerasimos, \"Font of Inspiration,\" Washington Times, Metropolitan Life Section, October 4, 1999, p.

[http://allmusic.com/artist/red-sovine-p1816/biography]</ref>\n\nThe first big truck-driving hit from Sovine, \"Giddyup Go\" is the tale of an emotional father-son reunion at a highway truck stop. The reunion is played out near the end of the song.\n\nIn the setup, the elder truck driver\u2014who shares his experiences in first person\u2014explains that he had spent the better part of 25 years on the road, most of them alone. In the early years of his career, he notes, he had a wife and young son. It was the son's gibberish attempt to greet his father, while driving the truck, that inspired the name of the truck (\"Giddyup Go\"). The stress of her husband's frequent absences eventually takes its toll on the marriage, and one day, the trucker returns home to find both gone, without contact information or an explanation. In the years following, the trucker is left to explain to other truck drivers the \"Giddyup Go\" nameplate on his truck, his only link to his son. \n\nIn the present time, the truck driver is traveling along [[U.S. Highway 66]] when he spots a new diesel rig with a nameplate reading \"Giddyup Go.\" The father gets a lump in his throat, suspecting that he may have some connection to its driver. The two drivers meet at the next truck stop, and during the course of their conversation the boy explains that his mother had died and that he had lost contact with his father. He also reveals that the name of his \"Giddyup Go\" truck was inspired by a rig his father once owned. It is at this point where the elder trucker takes the younger man outside to reveal their connection, dusting off the name to show him. Afterward, an emotional reunion takes place between the two men, who realize they are father and son.\n\n==Chart performance==\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!align=\"left\"|Chart (1965\u20131966)\n!align=\"center\"|Peak<br />position\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|U.S. ''Billboard'' Hot Country Singles\n|align=\"center\"|1\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|U.S. ''Billboard'' Hot 100\n|align=\"center\"|82\n|}\n\n==Answer version==\n[[Minnie Pearl]] recorded an answer version of \"Giddyup Go\", titled \"Giddyup Go Answer.\" A departure from her usual comic recordings, Pearl tells the story from the perspective of the manager of the truck stop where the father-son reunion takes place.\n\nThe story depicts the woman's friendship with the elder trucker's one-time wife, who had located to the area with her young son when the marriage broke up. It is explained that the woman had a terminal illness that required her to move to a drier climate and start a new life as a waitress. The years pass, her ex-husband never happens past the truck stop, and the woman's condition deteriorates further. On her deathbed, the woman tells her friend that she wishes for her son to become a truck driver, just like his father.\n\nIn the years following, the narrator watches the trucks drive by, wondering if the man that was at one time her friend's husband, will ever stop. Then comes the day where she gets her answer, when the two trucks pull into the parking lot of the truck stop; the song ends just as the father reveals the nameplate on his truck.\n\n\"Giddyup Go-Answer\" reached No. 10 on the ''Billboard'' Hot Country Singles chart in March 1966 and as Pearl's biggest hit, was her only charting single.\n\n==Covers==\nArtists who have covered \"Giddyup Go\" include [[Dave Dudley]], [[Del Reeves]], [[Tex Williams]], [[Ferlin Husky]], and Australian country singer Nev Nicholls. The song also received Dutch covers by Gerard de Vries in the mid sixties, and later on in the early 1990s by Paul de Leeuw, AKA Bob de Rooy.  The later version, however, was a satire version of the song.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}} \n\n{{Trucking industry in the United States}}\n\n[[Category:1965 songs]]\n[[Category:Red Sovine songs]]\n[[Category:1965 singles]]\n[[Category:Billboard Hot Country Songs number-one singles]]\n[[Category:Dave Dudley songs]]\n[[Category:Del Reeves songs]]\n[[Category:Tex Williams songs]]\n[[Category:Ferlin Husky songs]]\n[[Category:Recitation songs]]\n[[Category:Starday Records singles]]\n[[Category:Songs about truck driving]]\n[[Category:Songs about children]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox song\n| name       = Giddyup Go\n| cover      =\n| alt        =\n| type       = single\n| artist     = [[Red Sovine]]\n| album      = Giddyup Go\n| B-side     = Kiss and the Keys\n| released   = October 1965\n| format     =\n| recorded   = August 1965<BR>Starday Sound Studio<BR>Nashville, Tennessee\n| studio     =\n| venue      =\n| genre      = [[Country music|Country]], [[Truck-driving country]]\n| length     = 3:57\n| label      = [[Starday Records|Starday]]\n| writer     = Red Sovine and Tommy Hill\n| producer   = Tommy Hill\n| prev_title = Hold Everything (Till I Get Home)\n| prev_year  = 1956\n| next_title = Long Night\n| next_year  = 1966\n}}\n\"'''Giddyup Go'''\" is a country music song made famous by [[Red Sovine]].

The reunion is played out near the end of the song.\n\nIn the setup, the elder truck driver\u2014who shares his experiences in first person\u2014explains that he had spent the better part of 25 years on the road, most of them alone. In the early years of his career, he notes, he had a wife and young son. It was the son's gibberish attempt to greet his father, while driving the truck, that inspired the name of the truck (\"Giddyup Go\"). The stress of her husband's frequent absences eventually takes its toll on the marriage, and one day, the trucker returns home to find both gone, without contact information or an explanation. In the years following, the trucker is left to explain to other truck drivers the \"Giddyup Go\" nameplate on his truck, his only link to his son. \n\nIn the present time, the truck driver is traveling along [[U.S. Highway 66]] when he spots a new diesel rig with a nameplate reading \"Giddyup Go.\" The father gets a lump in his throat, suspecting that he may have some connection to its driver. The two drivers meet at the next truck stop, and during the course of their conversation the boy explains that his mother had died and that he had lost contact with his father. He also reveals that the name of his \"Giddyup Go\" truck was inspired by a rig his father once owned. It is at this point where the elder trucker takes the younger man outside to reveal their connection, dusting off the name to show him. Afterward, an emotional reunion takes place between the two men, who realize they are father and son.\n\n==Chart performance==\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!align=\"left\"|Chart (1965\u20131966)\n!align=\"center\"|Peak<br />position\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|U.S. ''Billboard'' Hot Country Singles\n|align=\"center\"|1\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|U.S. ''Billboard'' Hot 100\n|align=\"center\"|82\n|}\n\n==Answer version==\n[[Minnie Pearl]] recorded an answer version of \"Giddyup Go\", titled \"Giddyup Go Answer.\" A departure from her usual comic recordings, Pearl tells the story from the perspective of the manager of the truck stop where the father-son reunion takes place.\n\nThe story depicts the woman's friendship with the elder trucker's one-time wife, who had located to the area with her young son when the marriage broke up. It is explained that the woman had a terminal illness that required her to move to a drier climate and start a new life as a waitress. The years pass, her ex-husband never happens past the truck stop, and the woman's condition deteriorates further. On her deathbed, the woman tells her friend that she wishes for her son to become a truck driver, just like his father.\n\nIn the years following, the narrator watches the trucks drive by, wondering if the man that was at one time her friend's husband, will ever stop. Then comes the day where she gets her answer, when the two trucks pull into the parking lot of the truck stop; the song ends just as the father reveals the nameplate on his truck.\n\n\"Giddyup Go-Answer\" reached No. 10 on the ''Billboard'' Hot Country Singles chart in March 1966 and as Pearl's biggest hit, was her only charting single.\n\n==Covers==\nArtists who have covered \"Giddyup Go\" include [[Dave Dudley]], [[Del Reeves]], [[Tex Williams]], [[Ferlin Husky]], and Australian country singer Nev Nicholls. The song also received Dutch covers by Gerard de Vries in the mid sixties, and later on in the early 1990s by Paul de Leeuw, AKA Bob de Rooy.  The later version, however, was a satire version of the song.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}} \n\n{{Trucking industry in the United States}}\n\n[[Category:1965 songs]]\n[[Category:Red Sovine songs]]\n[[Category:1965 singles]]\n[[Category:Billboard Hot Country Songs number-one singles]]\n[[Category:Dave Dudley songs]]\n[[Category:Del Reeves songs]]\n[[Category:Tex Williams songs]]\n[[Category:Ferlin Husky songs]]\n[[Category:Recitation songs]]\n[[Category:Starday Records singles]]\n[[Category:Songs about truck driving]]\n[[Category:Songs about children]]\n", "name_user": "JGabbard", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eChart performance:-w", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giddyup_Go"}
