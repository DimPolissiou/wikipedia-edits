Apart from her group's activities, Sunny has participated in numerous side projects including original soundtracks, television variety shows, musical acting and radio hosting.\n\n==Life and career==\n===1989\u20132007: Early life and career beginnings===\nSunny was born on May 15, 1989, in [[Orange County, California|Orange County]], California.<ref name=\"past and present\"/> Her family consists of her parents and two older sisters who are ten and fifteen years older than her.

While Sunny was still an infant, her family moved to [[Kuwait]], then moved again shortly after to [[South Korea]], during the time of the [[Gulf War]]. As a result of her brief war experience, Sunny grew up being scared of loud noises. She was influenced to become a singer by her father, who was in a college band. In 1998, Sunny joined SM Entertainment and became a trainee for five years. She transferred to Starworld agency, where her father worked as a manager, and was to debut in a duo group called Sugar. The group, however, never came to fruition. In early 2007, singer [[Iconiq|Ayumi Lee]] convinced Sunny to rejoin SM Entertainment.

She debuted as a member of girl group [[Girls' Generation]] (and later its subgroup [[Oh!GG|Girls' Generation-Oh!GG]]) in August 2007, which went on to become one of the best-selling artists in South Korea and one of South Korea's most popular girl groups worldwide. Apart from her group's activities, Sunny has participated in numerous side projects including original soundtracks, television variety shows, musical acting and radio hosting.\n\n==Life and career==\n===1989\u20132007: Early life and career beginnings===\nSunny was born on May 15, 1989, in [[Orange County, California|Orange County]], California.<ref name=\"past and present\"/> Her family consists of her parents and two older sisters who are ten and fifteen years older than her. She and her sisters share the same birthday.<ref>{{cite web |script-title=ko:\uc18c\ub140\uc2dc\ub300 \uc368\ub2c8\uc5d0\uac8c 5\uc6d415\uc77c\uc774\ub780\u2026\ud655\ub960 13\ub9cc\ubd84\uc758 1|url=http://entertain.naver.com/read?oid=003&aid=0003676070|publisher=[[Naver]]|date=February 6, 2011|language=Korean}}</ref> Her father, Lee Soo-young, was also known to be the elder brother of [[SM Entertainment]] founder [[Lee Soo-man]]. While Sunny was still an infant, her family moved to [[Kuwait]], then moved again shortly after to [[South Korea]], during the time of the [[Gulf War]]. As a result of her brief war experience, Sunny grew up being scared of loud noises. She was influenced to become a singer by her father, who was in a college band. In 1998, Sunny joined SM Entertainment and became a trainee for five years. She transferred to Starworld agency, where her father worked as a manager, and was to debut in a duo group called Sugar. The group, however, never came to fruition. In early 2007, singer [[Iconiq|Ayumi Lee]] convinced Sunny to rejoin SM Entertainment. She continued her training there and made her official debut as a member of [[Girls' Generation]] in August 2007.<ref>{{cite web |script-title=ko:Invincible Youth \uccad\ucd98\ubd88\ud328 - Ep.15 : Lettuce patch planting, Mushroom cultivating|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-z2EuzMlaM|website=[[KBS World (TV channel)|KBS World]] on YouTube|publisher=Google Inc|accessdate=March 31, 2016|time=53:08|format=Video upload|date=July 29, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.newsen.com/news_view.php?uid=200903150049281001 |script-title=ko:\uc368\ub2c8 \"\ud0dc\uc5b4\ub098\uc790\ub9c8\uc790 \uac78\ud504\uc804 \ud53c\ub09c\ubbfc \uc0dd\ud65c\ud588\ub2e4\" \uae5c\uc9dd \uace0\ubc31|publisher=Newsen|date=March 15, 2009|language=korean|accessdate=April 3, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |script-title=ko:Talk 1, \ud1a0\ud06c, Lalala 20090625|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P82sC6X7vQc|website=[[Munhwa Broadcasting Corporation|MBC]] on YouTube|publisher=Google Inc|accessdate=April 3, 2016|time=3:20|format=Video upload|date=June 3, 2012}}</ref><ref name=\"past and present\">{{Cite news|title=[Past And Present] Small But Cutest Girl, Sunny |last=Ahn|first=Woorim|work=BNT News|date=November 17, 2014|accessdate=July 11, 2015|url=http://www.bntnews.co.uk/app/news.php?nid=14820}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.asiae.co.kr/news/view.htm?idxno=2007113015350222567&nvr=|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110904123255/http://www.asiae.co.kr/news/view.htm?idxno=2007113015350222567&nvr= |script-title=ko:\uc18c\ub140\uc2dc\ub300 \uc368\ub2c8 SM \uc774\uc218\ub9cc \uce5c\uc870\uce74 '\uc288\uac00 \ud6c4\uc18d \uadf8\ub8f9 \uba64\ubc84 \ub420 \ubed4'|archivedate=September 4, 2011|website=[[Korea Economic Daily]]|date=November 30, 2007|accessdate=March 31, 2016|language=korean}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://entertain.naver.com/read?oid=076&aid=0000084242 |script-title=ko:\uc18c\ub140\uc2dc\ub300 \uc368\ub2c8, '\uc74c\uc545\uac00 \uc9d1\uc548' \uc774\uc218\ub9cc \uce5c\uc870\uce74 \ud654\uc81c|date=December 3, 2007|publisher=[[The Chosun Ilbo]]|language=korean|accessdate=March 31, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://entertain.naver.com/read?oid=003&aid=0003676070 |script-title=ko:\uc18c\ub140\uc2dc\ub300 \uc368\ub2c8\uc5d0\uac8c 5\uc6d415\uc77c\uc774\ub780\u2026\ud655\ub960 13\ub9cc\ubd84\uc758 1|date=February 6, 2011|accessdate=March 31, 2016|publisher=Newsis|language=korean}}</ref> The group gained significant popularity with the release of their hit single \"[[Gee (Girls' Generation song)|Gee]]\" in 2009.<ref>{{cite news|first=Do-yeun|last=Kim|url=http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/art/2011/11/135_97862.html|title=Girls' Generation featured on Yale School of Art website|date=November 2, 2011|accessdate=February 28, 2015|publisher=Korea Times}}</ref>\n\n===2008\u2013present: Solo activities===\n\nAside from Girls' Generation's activities, Sunny has participated in a number of side-projects.

Drupal core is the stock element of Drupal. Common Drupal-specific libraries, as well as the bootstrap process, are defined as Drupal core; all other functionality is defined as Drupal modules including the system module itself.\n \nIn a Drupal website's default configuration, authors can contribute content as either registered or anonymous users (at the discretion of the administrator). This content is accessible to web visitors through a variety of selectable criteria. As of Drupal 8, Drupal has adopted some [[Symfony]] libraries into Drupal core.\n\nCore modules also includes a hierarchical [[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomy]] system, which lets developers categorize content or [[Tag (metadata)|tagged]] with key words for easier access.<ref name=features>{{Cite web | url=http://drupal.org/features | title=Features | work=drupal.org | accessdate=2009-04-08}}</ref>\n\nDrupal maintains a detailed [[changelog]] of core feature updates by version.<ref name=changelog>{{Cite web | url= https://www.drupal.org/drupal-7.39 | title= Drupal 7.39 released | work= drupal.org | accessdate= 2015-09-19}}</ref>\n\n===Core modules===\nDrupal core includes optional modules that can be enabled by the administrator to extend the functionality of the core website.<ref name=coremodules>{{Cite web | url=http://drupal.org/handbook/modules | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080728103300/http://drupal.org/handbook/modules | archivedate=2008-07-28 | title=Handbook: Core Modules | work=drupal.org | accessdate=2009-04-08}}</ref>\n\nThe core Drupal distribution provides a number of features, including:<ref name=coremodules/>\n{{columns-list|colwidth=22em|\n* Access statistics and logging\n* Advanced search\n* Blogs, books, comments, forums, and polls\n* Caching and feature throttling for improved performance\n* Descriptive URLs\n* Multi-level menu system\n* Multi-site support<ref name=multisite>{{Cite web | url=http://drupal.org/node/43816 | title=Drupal Multi-site installation recipes }}</ref>\n* Multi-user content creation and editing\n* [[OpenID]] support\n* RSS feed and feed aggregator\n* Security and new release update notification\n* User profiles\n* Various access control restrictions (user roles, IP addresses, email)\n* Workflow tools (triggers and actions)\n}}\n\n===Core themes===\nDrupal includes core themes, which customize the \"look and feel\" of Drupal sites,<ref name=coretheme>{{Cite web | url=http://drupal.org/node/91964 | title=Garland, the new default core theme | last=Buytaert | first=Dries | work=drupal.org | accessdate=2009-04-08}}</ref> for example, Garland and Bartik.\n\nThe Color Module, introduced in Drupal core 5.0, allows administrators to change the color scheme of certain themes via a browser interface.<ref name=colormodule>{{Cite web | url=http://drupal.org/handbook/modules/color | title=Color: Allows the user to change the color scheme of certain themes | work=drupal.org | accessdate=2009-04-08}}</ref>\n\n===Localization===\n{{As of|2017|01}}, Drupal had been made available in 100 languages and [[English language|English]] (the default).<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://localize.drupal.org/translate/downloads | title=Drupal core translation downloads | work=drupal.org | accessdate=2017-01-30}}</ref> Support is included for right-to-left languages such as [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Persian language|Persian]], and [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]].<ref name=sixnewfeatures>{{Cite web | url=http://drupal.org/drupal-6.0 | title=Drupal 6.0 released | work=drupal.org | accessdate=2009-04-08}}</ref>\n\nDrupal localization is built on top of [[gettext]], the GNU [[internationalization and localization]] (i18n) library.\n\n===Auto-update notification===\nDrupal can automatically notify the administrator about new versions of modules, themes, or the Drupal core.<ref name=sixnewfeatures/> It's important to update quickly after security updates are released.\n\nBefore updating it is highly recommended to take backup of core, modules, theme, files and database. If there is any error shown after update or if the new update is not compatible with a module, then it can be quickly replaced by backup. There are several backup modules available in Drupal.\n\nOn October 15, 2014, a sql injection vulnerability was announced and update released.<ref name=\"sql-injection-vulnerability\">{{cite web |url=https://www.drupal.org/SA-CORE-2014-005 |title=SA-CORE-2014-005 - Drupal core - SQL injection |newspaper=Https |date=  |accessdate= December 3, 2014}}</ref> Two weeks later the Drupal security team released an advisory explaining that everyone should act under the assumption that any site not updated within 7 hours of the announcement are infected.<ref name=\"sql-injection-exploited\">{{cite web |url=https://www.drupal.org/PSA-2014-003 |title=Drupal Core - Highly Critical - Public Service announcement - PSA-2014-003 |newspaper=Https |date=  |accessdate= December 3, 2014}}</ref> Thus, it can be extremely important to apply these updates quickly and usage of a tool to make this process easier like [[drush]] is highly recommended.\n\n===Database abstraction===\nPrior to version 7, Drupal had functions that performed tasks related to databases, such as SQL query cleansing, multi-site table name prefixing, and generating proper SQL queries. In particular, Drupal 6 introduced an abstraction layer that allowed programmers to create SQL queries without writing SQL.\n\nDrupal 9 extends the data abstraction layer so that a programmer no longer needs to write SQL queries as text strings. It uses [[PHP Data Objects]] to abstract the database. [[Microsoft]] has written a database driver for their [[Microsoft SQL Server|SQL Server]]. Drupal 7 supports the file-based [[SQLite]] database engine, which is part of the standard PHP distribution.\n\n===Windows development===\nWith Drupal 9's new database abstraction layer, and ability to run on the Windows web server [[Internet Information Services|IIS]], it is now easier for Windows developers to participate in the Drupal community.\n\nA group on Drupal.org is dedicated to Windows issues.<ref name=drupal-windows>{{Cite web | url=http://groups.drupal.org/drupal-windows | title=Drupal on Windows Group | work=drupal.org | accessdate=2011-02-14}}</ref>\n\n===Accessibility===\nSince the release of Drupal 7, [[Web accessibility]] has been constantly improving in the Drupal community.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://drupal.org/about/accessibility | title=Accessibility statement | last=Killesreiter | first=Gerhard | work=drupal.org | date=2013-02-25 | accessdate=2013-04-16}}</ref> Drupal is a good framework for building sites accessible to people with disabilities, because many of the best practices have been incorporated into Drupal Core. \n\nDrupal 8 saw many improvements from the [[Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines]] (ATAG) 2.0 guidelines which support both an accessible authoring environment as well as support for authors to produce more accessible content. \n\nThe accessibility team is carrying on the work of identifying and resolving accessibility barriers and raising awareness within the community.\n\nDrupal 8 has good semantic support for [[Rich Internet application|Rich Internet Applications]] through [[WAI-ARIA]]. There have been many improvements to both the visitor and administrator sides of Drupal, especially:\n* Drag and drop functionality;\n* Improved color contrast and intensity;\n* Adding skip navigation to core themes;\n* Adding labels by default for input forms;\n* Fixing CSS display:none with consistent methods for hiding and exposing text on focus;\n* Adding support for ARIA Live Regions with Drupal.announce(); and\n* Adding a TabbingManager to support better keyboard navigation.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.drupal.org/docs/8/accessibility/drupal-8-accessibility-features | title=Drupal 8 Accessibility Features }}</ref> \n\nThe community also added an accessibility gate for core issues in Drupal 8.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://drupal.org/core-gates#accessibility | title=Drupal core gates | last=Scholten | first=Roy | work=drupal.org | date=2012-12-10 | accessdate=2013-04-16}}</ref>\n\n==Extending the core==\nDrupal core is [[modular]], defining a system of [[Hooking|hooks]] and [[Callback (computer programming)|callbacks]], which are accessed internally via an [[API]].<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://api.drupal.org/ | title=API Reference | work=drupal.org | accessdate=2009-04-08}}</ref> This design allows third-party contributed [[#Modules|modules]] and [[#Themes|themes]] to extend or override Drupal's default behaviors without changing Drupal core's code.\n\nDrupal isolates core files from contributed modules and themes. This increases flexibility and security and allows administrators to cleanly upgrade to new releases without overwriting their site's customizations.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://drupal.org/node/22283 | title=File and directory management | work=drupal.org}}</ref> The Drupal community has the saying, \"Never hack core,\" a strong recommendation that site developers do not change core files.<ref name=\"drupal1\"/>\n\n===Modules===\nContributed modules offer such additional or alternate features as image galleries, custom content types and content listings, [[WYSIWYG]] editors, private messaging, third-party integration tools,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.specbee.com/blogs/symphony2-components-drupal-8-integration-every-drupaler-must-know-about|title=Integrating Drupal with External Systems|author=|first=|date=2018-08-24|website=|publisher=specbee.com|accessdate=2018-08-24|df=}}</ref> integrating with BPM portals,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.srijan.net/solutions/drupal-camunda-bpm-integration | title=Drupal Camunda BPM Integration | website=Srijan Technologies | publisher=Srijan Technologies| access-date=}}</ref> and more. {{As of|2019|12}} the Drupal website lists more than 44,000 free [[Modular programming|modules]].<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.drupal.org/project/project_module|title=Module project {{!}} Drupal.org|last=|first=|date=2019-12-21|website=www.drupal.org|publisher=|url-status=live|archive-url=https://archive.today/PM3OF|archive-date=2019-12-21|access-date=2017-09-21}}</ref>\n\nSome of the most commonly used contributed modules include:<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://drupal.org/project/usage | title=Project usage overview | work=Drupal.org | accessdate=2011-08-18}}</ref>\n* Content Construction Kit (CCK): allows site administrators to dynamically create content types by extending the database schema. \"Content type\" describes the kind of information.

Themes adapt or replace a Drupal site's default look and feel.\n\nDrupal themes use standardized formats that may be generated by common third-party theme design engines. Many are written in the [[PHPTemplate]] engine<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://drupal.org/phptemplate | title=PHPTemplate theme engine | work=drupal.org | accessdate=2009-04-08 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090308030334/http://drupal.org/phptemplate | archivedate=2009-03-08 }}</ref> or, to a lesser extent, the [[XTemplate]] engine.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://drupal.org/node/6493 | title=XTemplate theme engine | work=drupal.org | accessdate=2009-04-08 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090316205154/http://drupal.org/node/6493 | archivedate=2009-03-16 }}</ref> Some templates use hard-coded [[PHP]]. Drupal 8 and future versions of Drupal integrate the [[Twig (template engine)|Twig]] templating engine.\n\nThe inclusion of the PHPTemplate and XTemplate engines in Drupal addressed user concerns about flexibility and complexity.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://drupal.org/node/15689#comment-25704 | title=How does Drupal compare to Mambo? discussion thread | work=drupal.org | date=2005-01-17 | accessdate=2009-04-08}}</ref> The Drupal theming system utilizes a [[Template engine (web)|template engine]] to further separate [[HTML]]/[[CSS]] from PHP. A popular Drupal contributed module called 'Devel' provides GUI information to developers and themers about the page build.\n\nCommunity-contributed themes<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://drupal.org/project/Themes | title=Drupal themes|publisher=Drupal.org | accessdate=2011-08-31}}</ref> at the Drupal website are released under a free [[GNU General Public License|GPL]] license,<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://drupal.org/node/14208 | title=Adding your theme to Drupal.org|publisher=Drupal.org}}</ref> and the most installed Drupal themes are [https://www.drupal.org/project/project_theme/?solrsort=iss_project_release_usage%20desc&f%5B3%5D=sm_field_project_type%3Afull listed on this page].<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.dezignmatterz.com/best-responsive-drupal-themes/ | title=10 Best Drupal Themes|publisher=MAAN Softwares | accessdate=2017-11-08}}</ref>\n\n===Distributions===\nIn the past, those wanting a fully customized installation of Drupal had to download a pre-tailored version separately from the official Drupal core. Today, however, a distribution defines a packaged version of Drupal that upon installation, provides a website or application built for a specific purpose.\n\nThe distributions offer the benefit of a new Drupal site without having to manually seek out and install third-party contributed modules or adjust configuration settings.<ref>{{Cite web| title=Top Drupal Distributions| url=http://www.aglobalway.com/content/top-drupal-distributions| publisher=AGLOBALWAY Consulting Services Inc.| url-status=dead| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140413154924/http://www.aglobalway.com/content/top-drupal-distributions| archivedate=2014-04-13}}</ref> They are collections of modules, themes, and associated configuration settings that prepare Drupal for custom operation. For example, a distribution could configure Drupal as a \"brochure\" site rather than a news site or [[online store]].\n\n==Architecture==\nDrupal is based on the [[Presentation Abstraction Control]] architecture, or PAC.\n\nThe [https://api.drupal.org/api/drupal/includes!menu.inc/group/menu/7 menu system] acts as the Controller. It accepts input via a single source ([[Hypertext Transfer Protocol#HTTP GET|HTTP GET]] and [[POST (HTTP)|POST]]), routes requests to the appropriate helper functions, pulls data out of the Abstraction (nodes and, from Drupal 5 onwards, forms), and then pushes it through a filter to get a Presentation of it (the theme system).\n\nIt even has multiple, parallel PAC agents in the form of blocks that push data out to a common canvas (page.tpl.php).<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.garfieldtech.com/blog/mvc-vs-pac | title=MVC vs. PAC}}</ref>\n\n==Community==\nDrupal.org has a large community of users and developers who provide active [[community]] support by coming up with new updates to help improve the functionality of Drupal,<ref>[https://maansoftwares.com/blog/drupal/drupal-cms-grew-overnight Drupal - CMS Grew Overnight] By MAAN Softwares, Retrieved, June 8th, 2017</ref> {{As of|2017|01}} more than 105,400 users are actively contributing.<ref name=\"dohome\"/> The semiannual DrupalCon conference alternates between North America, Europe and Asia.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://groups.drupal.org/node/17870|title=drupal.org discussion on DrupalCon event management|publisher=Groups.drupal.org|accessdate=2011-08-31}}</ref> Attendance at DrupalCon grew from 500 at [[Szeged]] in August 2008, to over 3,700 people at Austin, Texas in June, 2014.\n\nSmaller events, known as \"Drupal Camps\" or DrupalCamp,<ref>{{cite web|title=Drupal Camps and Cons|url=http://buildamodule.com/drupal-camps-calendar|accessdate=25 January 2013}}</ref> occur throughout the year all over the world. The annual Florida DrupalCamp brings users together for [[Coding for a Cause]] that benefits a local nonprofit organization, as does the annual GLADCamp ([[Greater Los Angeles Drupal]] Camp) event, [[Coders with a Cause]].\n\nThe Drupal community also organizes professional and semi-professional gatherings called [[meeting|meetups]] at a large number of venues around the world. \n\nThere are a number of active Drupal forums,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://drupal.org/forum/|title=forums|publisher=Drupal.org|accessdate=2011-08-31}}</ref> mailing lists<ref>{{cite web|url=http://drupal.org/mailing-lists|title=mailing lists|publisher=Drupal.org|accessdate=2011-08-31}}</ref> and discussion groups.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://groups.drupal.org/|title=Drupal Groups|publisher=Groups.drupal.org|accessdate=2011-08-31}}</ref> Drupal also maintains several [[IRC]] channels<ref>{{cite web|url=http://drupal.org/node/108355|title=Drupal IRC channels on FreeNode|publisher=Drupal.org|accessdate=2011-08-31}}</ref> on the [[Freenode]] network.\n\nThere are over 30 national communities<ref>{{cite web|url=http://drupal.org/language-specific-communities|title=Language specific communities|publisher=Drupal.org|date=2011-08-26|accessdate=2011-08-31}}</ref> around drupal.org offering language-specific support.\n\nNotable Drupal users include [[NBC]], [[Taboola]], [[Patch Media|Patch]], and [[We the People (petitioning system)|We the People]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Spencer|first1=Jamie|title=CMS Battle for Beginners: WordPress vs Joomla vs Drupal (Infographic)|url=https://makeawebsitehub.com/compare/content-management-system-cms-comparison/|accessdate=17 May 2017|work=MakeAWebsiteHub.com|date=7 April 2017|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Security==\nDrupal's policy is to announce the nature of each security vulnerability once the fix is released.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://drupal.org/security-team | title=Security announcement and release process| author=Drupal}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url=https://drupal.org/security-team/report-issue | title=How to report a security issue| author=Drupal}}</ref>\n\nAdministrators of Drupal sites are automatically notified of these new releases via the Update Status module (Drupal 6) or via the Update Manager (Drupal 7).<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://drupal.org/documentation/modules/update | title=Update manager (and Update status) | work=drupal.org | accessdate=2011-07-01}}</ref>\n\nDrupal maintains a security announcement mailing list, a history of all security advisories,<ref name=\"security\">{{Cite web|url=http://drupal.org/security|title=Security advisories|work=drupal.org|accessdate=2009-04-28}}</ref> a security team home page,<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://drupal.org/security-team | title=Drupal security team|publisher=Drupal.org | accessdate=2011-08-31}}</ref> and an RSS feed<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://drupal.org/security/rss.xml | title=Drupal Security RSS feed|publisher=Drupal.org | accessdate=2011-08-31}}</ref> with the most recent security advisories.\n\nIn mid-October 2014,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2014/11/03/drupal_drupalgeddon_analysis/|title=Drupalgeddon megaflaw raises questions over CMS bods' crisis mgmt}}</ref> Drupal issued a \"highly critical\" security advisory regarding an [[SQL injection]] bug in Drupal 7, also known as Drupalgeddon.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.drupal.org/SA-CORE-2014-005|title=SA-CORE-2014-005 - Drupal core - SQL injection|work=Security advisories|publisher=Drupal security team}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.drop-guard.net/blog/drupalgeddon-panama-papers|work=Blog|publisher=Drop Guard|title=Drupalgeddon strikes back: outdated Drupal allegedly linked to \"Panama Papers\"}}</ref>\n\nDownloading and installing an upgrade to Drupal 7.32 fixes the vulnerability, but does not remove any [[backdoor (computing)|backdoor]] installed by hackers if the site has already been [[exploit (computer security)|compromised]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.drupal.org/PSA-2014-003|title=Drupal Core&mdash;Highly Critical&mdash;Public Service Announcement&mdash;PSA-2014-003|last=|first=|date=October 29, 2014|work=Security advisories|publisher=Drupal security team|access-date=|quote=<p>You should proceed under the assumption that every Drupal 7 website was compromised unless updated or patched before Oct 15th, 11pm UTC, that is 7 hours after the announcement.</p><p>'''Simply updating to Drupal 7.32 will not remove backdoors'''....updating to version 7.32 or applying the patch fixes the vulnerability but does not fix an already compromised website.

Drupal core is the stock element of Drupal. Common Drupal-specific libraries, as well as the bootstrap process, are defined as Drupal core; all other functionality is defined as Drupal modules including the system module itself.\n \nIn a Drupal website's default configuration, authors can contribute content as either registered or anonymous users (at the discretion of the administrator). This content is accessible to web visitors through a variety of selectable criteria. As of Drupal 8, Drupal has adopted some [[Symfony]] libraries into Drupal core.\n\nCore modules also includes a hierarchical [[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomy]] system, which lets developers categorize content or [[Tag (metadata)|tagged]] with key words for easier access.<ref name=features>{{Cite web | url=http://drupal.org/features | title=Features | work=drupal.org | accessdate=2009-04-08}}</ref>\n\nDrupal maintains a detailed [[changelog]] of core feature updates by version.<ref name=changelog>{{Cite web | url= https://www.drupal.org/drupal-7.39 | title= Drupal 7.39 released | work= drupal.org | accessdate= 2015-09-19}}</ref>\n\n===Core modules===\nDrupal core includes optional modules that can be enabled by the administrator to extend the functionality of the core website.<ref name=coremodules>{{Cite web | url=http://drupal.org/handbook/modules | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080728103300/http://drupal.org/handbook/modules | archivedate=2008-07-28 | title=Handbook: Core Modules | work=drupal.org | accessdate=2009-04-08}}</ref>\n\nThe core Drupal distribution provides a number of features, including:<ref name=coremodules/>\n{{columns-list|colwidth=22em|\n* Access statistics and logging\n* Advanced search\n* Blogs, books, comments, forums, and polls\n* Caching and feature throttling for improved performance\n* Descriptive URLs\n* Multi-level menu system\n* Multi-site support<ref name=multisite>{{Cite web | url=http://drupal.org/node/43816 | title=Drupal Multi-site installation recipes }}</ref>\n* Multi-user content creation and editing\n* [[OpenID]] support\n* RSS feed and feed aggregator\n* Security and new release update notification\n* User profiles\n* Various access control restrictions (user roles, IP addresses, email)\n* Workflow tools (triggers and actions)\n}}\n\n===Core themes===\nDrupal includes core themes, which customize the \"look and feel\" of Drupal sites,<ref name=coretheme>{{Cite web | url=http://drupal.org/node/91964 | title=Garland, the new default core theme | last=Buytaert | first=Dries | work=drupal.org | accessdate=2009-04-08}}</ref> for example, Garland and Bartik.\n\nThe Color Module, introduced in Drupal core 5.0, allows administrators to change the color scheme of certain themes via a browser interface.<ref name=colormodule>{{Cite web | url=http://drupal.org/handbook/modules/color | title=Color: Allows the user to change the color scheme of certain themes | work=drupal.org | accessdate=2009-04-08}}</ref>\n\n===Localization===\n{{As of|2017|01}}, Drupal had been made available in 100 languages and [[English language|English]] (the default).<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://localize.drupal.org/translate/downloads | title=Drupal core translation downloads | work=drupal.org | accessdate=2017-01-30}}</ref> Support is included for right-to-left languages such as [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Persian language|Persian]], and [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]].<ref name=sixnewfeatures>{{Cite web | url=http://drupal.org/drupal-6.0 | title=Drupal 6.0 released | work=drupal.org | accessdate=2009-04-08}}</ref>\n\nDrupal localization is built on top of [[gettext]], the GNU [[internationalization and localization]] (i18n) library.\n\n===Auto-update notification===\nDrupal can automatically notify the administrator about new versions of modules, themes, or the Drupal core.<ref name=sixnewfeatures/> It's important to update quickly after security updates are released.\n\nBefore updating it is highly recommended to take backup of core, modules, theme, files and database. If there is any error shown after update or if the new update is not compatible with a module, then it can be quickly replaced by backup. There are several backup modules available in Drupal.\n\nOn October 15, 2014, a sql injection vulnerability was announced and update released.<ref name=\"sql-injection-vulnerability\">{{cite web |url=https://www.drupal.org/SA-CORE-2014-005 |title=SA-CORE-2014-005 - Drupal core - SQL injection |newspaper=Https |date=  |accessdate= December 3, 2014}}</ref> Two weeks later the Drupal security team released an advisory explaining that everyone should act under the assumption that any site not updated within 7 hours of the announcement are infected.<ref name=\"sql-injection-exploited\">{{cite web |url=https://www.drupal.org/PSA-2014-003 |title=Drupal Core - Highly Critical - Public Service announcement - PSA-2014-003 |newspaper=Https |date=  |accessdate= December 3, 2014}}</ref> Thus, it can be extremely important to apply these updates quickly and usage of a tool to make this process easier like [[drush]] is highly recommended.\n\n===Database abstraction===\nPrior to version 7, Drupal had functions that performed tasks related to databases, such as SQL query cleansing, multi-site table name prefixing, and generating proper SQL queries. In particular, Drupal 6 introduced an abstraction layer that allowed programmers to create SQL queries without writing SQL.\n\nDrupal 9 extends the data abstraction layer so that a programmer no longer needs to write SQL queries as text strings. It uses [[PHP Data Objects]] to abstract the database. [[Microsoft]] has written a database driver for their [[Microsoft SQL Server|SQL Server]]. Drupal 7 supports the file-based [[SQLite]] database engine, which is part of the standard PHP distribution.\n\n===Windows development===\nWith Drupal 9's new database abstraction layer, and ability to run on the Windows web server [[Internet Information Services|IIS]], it is now easier for Windows developers to participate in the Drupal community.\n\nA group on Drupal.org is dedicated to Windows issues.<ref name=drupal-windows>{{Cite web | url=http://groups.drupal.org/drupal-windows | title=Drupal on Windows Group | work=drupal.org | accessdate=2011-02-14}}</ref>\n\n===Accessibility===\nSince the release of Drupal 7, [[Web accessibility]] has been constantly improving in the Drupal community.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://drupal.org/about/accessibility | title=Accessibility statement | last=Killesreiter | first=Gerhard | work=drupal.org | date=2013-02-25 | accessdate=2013-04-16}}</ref> Drupal is a good framework for building sites accessible to people with disabilities, because many of the best practices have been incorporated into Drupal Core. \n\nDrupal 8 saw many improvements from the [[Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines]] (ATAG) 2.0 guidelines which support both an accessible authoring environment as well as support for authors to produce more accessible content. \n\nThe accessibility team is carrying on the work of identifying and resolving accessibility barriers and raising awareness within the community.\n\nDrupal 8 has good semantic support for [[Rich Internet application|Rich Internet Applications]] through [[WAI-ARIA]]. There have been many improvements to both the visitor and administrator sides of Drupal, especially:\n* Drag and drop functionality;\n* Improved color contrast and intensity;\n* Adding skip navigation to core themes;\n* Adding labels by default for input forms;\n* Fixing CSS display:none with consistent methods for hiding and exposing text on focus;\n* Adding support for ARIA Live Regions with Drupal.announce(); and\n* Adding a TabbingManager to support better keyboard navigation.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.drupal.org/docs/8/accessibility/drupal-8-accessibility-features | title=Drupal 8 Accessibility Features }}</ref> \n\nThe community also added an accessibility gate for core issues in Drupal 8.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://drupal.org/core-gates#accessibility | title=Drupal core gates | last=Scholten | first=Roy | work=drupal.org | date=2012-12-10 | accessdate=2013-04-16}}</ref>\n\n==Extending the core==\nDrupal core is [[modular]], defining a system of [[Hooking|hooks]] and [[Callback (computer programming)|callbacks]], which are accessed internally via an [[API]].<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://api.drupal.org/ | title=API Reference | work=drupal.org | accessdate=2009-04-08}}</ref> This design allows third-party contributed [[#Modules|modules]] and [[#Themes|themes]] to extend or override Drupal's default behaviors without changing Drupal core's code.\n\nDrupal isolates core files from contributed modules and themes. This increases flexibility and security and allows administrators to cleanly upgrade to new releases without overwriting their site's customizations.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://drupal.org/node/22283 | title=File and directory management | work=drupal.org}}</ref> The Drupal community has the saying, \"Never hack core,\" a strong recommendation that site developers do not change core files.<ref name=\"drupal1\"/>\n\n===Modules===\nContributed modules offer such additional or alternate features as image galleries, custom content types and content listings, [[WYSIWYG]] editors, private messaging, third-party integration tools,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.specbee.com/blogs/symphony2-components-drupal-8-integration-every-drupaler-must-know-about|title=Integrating Drupal with External Systems|author=|first=|date=2018-08-24|website=|publisher=specbee.com|accessdate=2018-08-24|df=}}</ref> integrating with BPM portals,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.srijan.net/solutions/drupal-camunda-bpm-integration | title=Drupal Camunda BPM Integration | website=Srijan Technologies | publisher=Srijan Technologies| access-date=}}</ref> and more. {{As of|2019|12}} the Drupal website lists more than 44,000 free [[Modular programming|modules]].<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.drupal.org/project/project_module|title=Module project {{!}} Drupal.org|last=|first=|date=2019-12-21|website=www.drupal.org|publisher=|url-status=live|archive-url=https://archive.today/PM3OF|archive-date=2019-12-21|access-date=2017-09-21}}</ref>\n\nSome of the most commonly used contributed modules include:<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://drupal.org/project/usage | title=Project usage overview | work=Drupal.org | accessdate=2011-08-18}}</ref>\n* Content Construction Kit (CCK): allows site administrators to dynamically create content types by extending the database schema. \"Content type\" describes the kind of information.

A popular Drupal contributed module called 'Devel' provides GUI information to developers and themers about the page build.\n\nCommunity-contributed themes<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://drupal.org/project/Themes | title=Drupal themes|publisher=Drupal.org | accessdate=2011-08-31}}</ref> at the Drupal website are released under a free [[GNU General Public License|GPL]] license,<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://drupal.org/node/14208 | title=Adding your theme to Drupal.org|publisher=Drupal.org}}</ref> and the most installed Drupal themes are [https://www.drupal.org/project/project_theme/?solrsort=iss_project_release_usage%20desc&f%5B3%5D=sm_field_project_type%3Afull listed on this page].<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.dezignmatterz.com/best-responsive-drupal-themes/ | title=10 Best Drupal Themes|publisher=MAAN Softwares | accessdate=2017-11-08}}</ref>\n\n===Distributions===\nIn the past, those wanting a fully customized installation of Drupal had to download a pre-tailored version separately from the official Drupal core. Today, however, a distribution defines a packaged version of Drupal that upon installation, provides a website or application built for a specific purpose.\n\nThe distributions offer the benefit of a new Drupal site without having to manually seek out and install third-party contributed modules or adjust configuration settings.<ref>{{Cite web| title=Top Drupal Distributions| url=http://www.aglobalway.com/content/top-drupal-distributions| publisher=AGLOBALWAY Consulting Services Inc.| url-status=dead| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140413154924/http://www.aglobalway.com/content/top-drupal-distributions| archivedate=2014-04-13}}</ref> They are collections of modules, themes, and associated configuration settings that prepare Drupal for custom operation. For example, a distribution could configure Drupal as a \"brochure\" site rather than a news site or [[online store]].\n\n==Architecture==\nDrupal is based on the [[Presentation Abstraction Control]] architecture, or PAC.\n\nThe [https://api.drupal.org/api/drupal/includes!menu.inc/group/menu/7 menu system] acts as the Controller. It accepts input via a single source ([[Hypertext Transfer Protocol#HTTP GET|HTTP GET]] and [[POST (HTTP)|POST]]), routes requests to the appropriate helper functions, pulls data out of the Abstraction (nodes and, from Drupal 5 onwards, forms), and then pushes it through a filter to get a Presentation of it (the theme system).\n\nIt even has multiple, parallel PAC agents in the form of blocks that push data out to a common canvas (page.tpl.php).<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.garfieldtech.com/blog/mvc-vs-pac | title=MVC vs. PAC}}</ref>\n\n==Community==\nDrupal.org has a large community of users and developers who provide active [[community]] support by coming up with new updates to help improve the functionality of Drupal,<ref>[https://maansoftwares.com/blog/drupal/drupal-cms-grew-overnight Drupal - CMS Grew Overnight] By MAAN Softwares, Retrieved, June 8th, 2017</ref> {{As of|2017|01}} more than 105,400 users are actively contributing.<ref name=\"dohome\"/> The semiannual DrupalCon conference alternates between North America, Europe and Asia.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://groups.drupal.org/node/17870|title=drupal.org discussion on DrupalCon event management|publisher=Groups.drupal.org|accessdate=2011-08-31}}</ref> Attendance at DrupalCon grew from 500 at [[Szeged]] in August 2008, to over 3,700 people at Austin, Texas in June, 2014.\n\nSmaller events, known as \"Drupal Camps\" or DrupalCamp,<ref>{{cite web|title=Drupal Camps and Cons|url=http://buildamodule.com/drupal-camps-calendar|accessdate=25 January 2013}}</ref> occur throughout the year all over the world.

He took a Scriptural view of the origin of the [[Aethiopia|Ethiopian]]s, Egyptians, and other races of ancient Africa, arguing that they were descended from the four sons of [[Ham (son of Noah)|Ham]]; and showed from classic authority the high civilisation to which they had attained when Greece was yet barbarous, and before Rome arose. [[Herodotus]] had spoken of the Ethiopians as remarkable for their stature, longevity, and physical beauty; and although in the eyes of the white man they were not remarkable for the latter quality at present, the influence of adverse circumstances and of centuries of oppression should be taken into account. There was scarcely a race, he showed, on the face of the earth, which had not declined in intellectual power and physical beauty under the same influences, and in the medi\u00e6val ages, when Englishmen were sold as slaves, they were described by their purchasers, the Irishmen and Romans, as ugly and stupid. The lecturer then dwelt more particularly upon the leading characteristics of the African race, their religious tendency, and the predominance of the moral over the intellectual in their character\u2014the affeetionateness of their disposition, their love of humour, &c. He gave many weighty hits at Anglo-Saxon civilisation, which told well with the audience, who appeared very much delighted.

He took a Scriptural view of the origin of the [[Aethiopia|Ethiopian]]s, Egyptians, and other races of ancient Africa, arguing that they were descended from the four sons of [[Ham (son of Noah)|Ham]]; and showed from classic authority the high civilisation to which they had attained when Greece was yet barbarous, and before Rome arose. [[Herodotus]] had spoken of the Ethiopians as remarkable for their stature, longevity, and physical beauty; and although in the eyes of the white man they were not remarkable for the latter quality at present, the influence of adverse circumstances and of centuries of oppression should be taken into account. There was scarcely a race, he showed, on the face of the earth, which had not declined in intellectual power and physical beauty under the same influences, and in the medi\u00e6val ages, when Englishmen were sold as slaves, they were described by their purchasers, the Irishmen and Romans, as ugly and stupid. The lecturer then dwelt more particularly upon the leading characteristics of the African race, their religious tendency, and the predominance of the moral over the intellectual in their character\u2014the affeetionateness of their disposition, their love of humour, &c. He gave many weighty hits at Anglo-Saxon civilisation, which told well with the audience, who appeared very much delighted.

As the author of ''A Tour in the United States of America'' (1784), he used the name '''John Ferdinand Dalziel Smyth'''. \n\nLeaving America during the Revolutionary War, Stuart spent the rest of his life in England and the West Indies.\n==Background and early life==\nStuart was born in Scotland in 1745 and began life there as John Smyth or John Ferdinand Smyth. He later wrote that he was the son of R. Wentworth Smyth, a gentleman who had fought in the [[Jacobite rising of 1715]] and also the [[Jacobite rising of 1745|later one of 1745]]. According to Stuart\u2019s account, in 1744 his father was sixty-six and married Maria Julia Dalziel, a girl of fifteen, as his second wife. He reported that his mother was a grand-daughter of [[James Crofts (British Army officer)|General James Crofts]], a natural son of the [[James Scott, 1st Duke of Monmouth|Duke of Monmouth]], a son of Charles II, and that Wentworth Smyth was Monmouth\u2019s natural son by Henrietta Maria Wentworth, a daughter of [[Thomas Wentworth, 5th Baron Wentworth|Thomas, Lord Wentworth]], and grand-daughter of [[Thomas Wentworth, 1st Earl of Cleveland]]. Henrietta Maria had died in 1686, not long after Monmouth's execution, and that a Colonel Smyth, an [[aide-de-camp]] of Monmouth\u2019s, had adopted her son and made him his own heir.<ref name=dnb>[[Edward Irving Carlyle]], \u201cStuart, John Ferdinand Smyth\u201d, in ''[[Dictionary of National Biography]] 1885-1900'', Vol. 55</ref> Consequently, Stuart\u2019s father grew up in France.

By the 1770s, he had became a planter, renting plantations rather than owning them.<ref name=AJC/> The [[American Revolutionary War]] broke out, and on 15 October 1775, as a loyalist to Great Britain, Smyth quitted Virginia and joined the [[Loyalists fighting in the American Revolution|Loyalist forces]].

More than once he was taken prisoner, and was shackled for eighteen months.<ref name=dnb/>\n\nAt New York, at about the end of 1777, Captain Smyth wrote his ''Narrative or Journal of Capt.

In May 1779, he launched a number of proceedings against his commanding officer, Lieutenant-Colonel [[John Graves Simcoe]], but they were found to be \u201cMalicious, Frivolous, Vexatious, & Groundless\u201d. Simcoe claimed that Captain Smyth \u201cavoided military service whenever possible\u201d. At a muster in June 1779, he had sick leave, and not far into 1780, he returned to England, on the grounds of ill health.<ref name=AJC/>\n\n==England and West Indies==\nStuart remained an officer on half-pay for the duration of the American War. The British government had set up a Commission to give financial help to loyalists with losses from the war, and in 1780 they awarded Stuart \u00a3100 a year as an interim allowance, increasing this to \u00a3200 in 1781 and to \u00a3300 in 1783. He made an application to the Privy Council, asking to be awarded [[Long Island, Bahamas|Long Island]], a Crown property in [[the Bahamas]], in view of his claimed losses of 3,300 acres in Virginia and Maryland, but he was not believed and this was rejected. His half-pay came to an end in 1783.<ref name=AJC/>\n\nIn 1784, allegations were made against Stuart to the claims commissioners, and his allowance was suspended. Stuart then wrote his book ''A Tour in the United States of America'',<ref name=dnb/> which was published by [[George Robinson (1737\u20131801)|George Robinson]] in 1784, agreeing to pay \u00a3160 for the printing. This, however, brought his account of himself to a wide public, and people who had known him in North America challenged it.<ref name=AJC/> \n\nIn 1785, Stuart went out to Jamaica, where he was appointed a Major \u201cin that Island only\u201d, but only remained there for sixteen days, as the result of a [[hurricane]].<ref name=AJC/>\n\nIn 1793, he adopted the name of Stuart, to mark his claim to descent from the [[House of Stuart]], and went on arguing his case to the government, without success.<ref name=dnb/>\n\nIn 1795, Stuart accepted a post as assistant barrack-master-general in [[San Domingo]] and to get there joined [[Admiral (Royal Navy)|Admiral]] [[Hugh Cloberry Christian|Sir Hugh Cloberry Christian]] on an expedition to the [[West Indies]]. He was shipwrecked three times in 1795 and 1796 and was present at the British capture of [[Saint Lucia]] and [[Martinique]].
