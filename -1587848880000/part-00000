In 1863 and 1864 it was temporarily known as the Mounted Infantry, 123rd Regiment as part of Wilder's Lightning Brigade.\n\n==Service==\nThis regiment was organized at Camp Terry, [[Mattoon, Illinois|Mattoon]], [[Coles County]], [[Illinois]], by Colonel James Monroe, who at the time was major of the [[7th Illinois Volunteer Regiment|7th Illinois Infantry]].<ref name=\"Reece\">Reece</ref> Companies A, C, D, H, I and K were from Coles County; B from [[Cumberland County, Illinois|Cumberland]]; E from [[Clark County, Illinois|Clark]]; F and G from Clark and [[Crawford County, Illinois|Crawford]]. As a colonel in 1861, [[Ulysses S. Grant]] organized his first command, the [[21st Illinois Volunteer Infantry Regiment]], in Mattoon.\n\nIt was mustered into service on September 6, 1862, with James Monroe as Colonel, Jonathan Biggs, of Westfield, Clark County, as Lieutenant Colonel, and James A. Connolly, of [[Charleston, Illinois]], as Major. On 19 September 1862, the Regiment was loaded into freight cars at Mattoon, and transported to [[Louisville, Kentucky]], where it was at once put to work, under Major General [[William \"Bull\" Nelson]], to fortify the city against Confederate General [[Braxton Bragg]], who was then advancing on it in pursuit of Union General [[Don Carlos Buell]].\n\nOn October 1, having been assigned to the Thirty-third Brigade (General [[William R. Terrill]]), Fourth Division (General [[James S. Jackson]]), in [[Alexander McDowell McCook|McCook's Corps]], the regiment started on the march under Buell, southward through Kentucky, after Bragg, who had turned back, and up to this time the regiment never had battalion drill, and hardly an attempt at company drill, as all the officers, except the colonel, were \"raw recruits\".\n\nJust 19 days after leaving Mattoon, the regiment engaged in the [[Battle of Perryville]], where 36 men were killed in action and 180 wounded.<ref name=\"Jared\">Jared </ref> Generals Terrill and Jackson were both killed immediately behind and within twenty feet of the line of the regiment. Among the wounded were Captain Coblentz of Company E, First Lieutenant S. M. Shepard of Company A and Adjutant Leander H. Hamlin. Following the devastating bloodshed the 123rd was assigned to protect the railroad bridge across the Green River at [[Munfordville]], [[Kentucky]], in November and December 1862. It has become known as the \"Battle for the Bridge,\" which began when the Union garrison led by [[John T. Wilder]], prior to his assuming command of the 123rd, surrendered during the [[Battle of Munfordville]].\n\nThe 123rd was initially assigned to the [[Army of the Ohio]] from September 1862 to November 1862, and then to the [[Army of the Cumberland]] from November 1862 to June 1865. The commanding general of the Army of the Cumberland was [[William Rosecrans]]. The regiment was in the 1st Brigade with Colonel Albert S. Hall, which was part of the 5th Division commanded by Brigadier General [[Joseph J. Reynolds]], reporting to Major General [[George Henry Thomas]]. \n\nIn February and March 1863, it was converted to mounted infantry. The 123rd Illinois' brigade became known as \"Wilder's [[Lightning Brigade (US Army of the Cumberland 1863)|Lightning Brigade]]\" commanded by [[John T. Wilder|Wilder]]. The brigade remained the 1st Brigade of the 5th Division, XIV Army Corps after its conversion. During this conversion, [[Spencer repeating rifle]]s, invented by [[Christopher Spencer]], were adopted as the command's primary weapon.<ref>[http://www.civilwar.si.edu/weapons_spencer.html A Spencer carbine at the Smithsonian Institution]</ref> The 123rd first used its new rifles in the [[Battle of Hoover's Gap]].<ref>[http://howcanamandiebetter.com/the-lightning-brigade]</ref>\n\n[[Image:Spencer-rifle transparent.png|thumb|left|300px|As part of the \"Wilder Lightning Brigade\" the 123rd was among the first units fighting in the Civil War to receive the [[Spencer repeating rifle]].]]\n\nThe new increase in firepower that the Spencer gave, allowed the 123rd and its brigade mates to maul numerically superior Confederate infantry and cavalry in several engagements. The regiment served quite well through the remainder of the [[Tullahoma campaign|Tullahoma Campaign]] and as part of the Lightning Brigade, was one of the few positive notes in the calamitous [[Chickamauga Campaign]]. \n\nDuring the [[Siege of Chattanooga]], the Lightning Brigade disbanded, and four of its regiments shifted to the Cavalry Corps where they served for the remainder of the war. The 123rd and the 72nd Indiana were sent to the 3rd Brigade of the 2nd Division.\n\nDuring the [[Battle of Selma]], First Lieutenant O. J. McManus, Sergeants J. S. Mullen and Henry E.

In 1863 and 1864 it was temporarily known as the Mounted Infantry, 123rd Regiment as part of Wilder's Lightning Brigade.\n\n==Service==\nThis regiment was organized at Camp Terry, [[Mattoon, Illinois|Mattoon]], [[Coles County]], [[Illinois]], by Colonel James Monroe, who at the time was major of the [[7th Illinois Volunteer Regiment|7th Illinois Infantry]].<ref name=\"Reece\">Reece</ref> Companies A, C, D, H, I and K were from Coles County; B from [[Cumberland County, Illinois|Cumberland]]; E from [[Clark County, Illinois|Clark]]; F and G from Clark and [[Crawford County, Illinois|Crawford]]. As a colonel in 1861, [[Ulysses S. Grant]] organized his first command, the [[21st Illinois Volunteer Infantry Regiment]], in Mattoon.\n\nIt was mustered into service on September 6, 1862, with James Monroe as Colonel, Jonathan Biggs, of Westfield, Clark County, as Lieutenant Colonel, and James A. Connolly, of [[Charleston, Illinois]], as Major. On 19 September 1862, the Regiment was loaded into freight cars at Mattoon, and transported to [[Louisville, Kentucky]], where it was at once put to work, under Major General [[William \"Bull\" Nelson]], to fortify the city against Confederate General [[Braxton Bragg]], who was then advancing on it in pursuit of Union General [[Don Carlos Buell]].\n\nOn October 1, having been assigned to the Thirty-third Brigade (General [[William R. Terrill]]), Fourth Division (General [[James S. Jackson]]), in [[Alexander McDowell McCook|McCook's Corps]], the regiment started on the march under Buell, southward through Kentucky, after Bragg, who had turned back, and up to this time the regiment never had battalion drill, and hardly an attempt at company drill, as all the officers, except the colonel, were \"raw recruits\".\n\nJust 19 days after leaving Mattoon, the regiment engaged in the [[Battle of Perryville]], where 36 men were killed in action and 180 wounded.<ref name=\"Jared\">Jared </ref> Generals Terrill and Jackson were both killed immediately behind and within twenty feet of the line of the regiment. Among the wounded were Captain Coblentz of Company E, First Lieutenant S. M. Shepard of Company A and Adjutant Leander H. Hamlin. Following the devastating bloodshed the 123rd was assigned to protect the railroad bridge across the Green River at [[Munfordville]], [[Kentucky]], in November and December 1862. It has become known as the \"Battle for the Bridge,\" which began when the Union garrison led by [[John T. Wilder]], prior to his assuming command of the 123rd, surrendered during the [[Battle of Munfordville]].\n\nThe 123rd was initially assigned to the [[Army of the Ohio]] from September 1862 to November 1862, and then to the [[Army of the Cumberland]] from November 1862 to June 1865. The commanding general of the Army of the Cumberland was [[William Rosecrans]]. The regiment was in the 1st Brigade with Colonel Albert S. Hall, which was part of the 5th Division commanded by Brigadier General [[Joseph J. Reynolds]], reporting to Major General [[George Henry Thomas]]. \n\nIn February and March 1863, it was converted to mounted infantry. The 123rd Illinois' brigade became known as \"Wilder's [[Lightning Brigade (US Army of the Cumberland 1863)|Lightning Brigade]]\" commanded by [[John T. Wilder|Wilder]]. The brigade remained the 1st Brigade of the 5th Division, XIV Army Corps after its conversion. During this conversion, [[Spencer repeating rifle]]s, invented by [[Christopher Spencer]], were adopted as the command's primary weapon.<ref>[http://www.civilwar.si.edu/weapons_spencer.html A Spencer carbine at the Smithsonian Institution]</ref> The 123rd first used its new rifles in the [[Battle of Hoover's Gap]].<ref>[http://howcanamandiebetter.com/the-lightning-brigade]</ref>\n\n[[Image:Spencer-rifle transparent.png|thumb|left|300px|As part of the \"Wilder Lightning Brigade\" the 123rd was among the first units fighting in the Civil War to receive the [[Spencer repeating rifle]].]]\n\nThe new increase in firepower that the Spencer gave, allowed the 123rd and its brigade mates to maul numerically superior Confederate infantry and cavalry in several engagements. The regiment served quite well through the remainder of the [[Tullahoma campaign|Tullahoma Campaign]] and as part of the Lightning Brigade, was one of the few positive notes in the calamitous [[Chickamauga Campaign]]. \n\nDuring the [[Siege of Chattanooga]], the Lightning Brigade disbanded, and four of its regiments shifted to the Cavalry Corps where they served for the remainder of the war. The 123rd and the 72nd Indiana were sent to the 3rd Brigade of the 2nd Division.\n\nDuring the [[Battle of Selma]], First Lieutenant O. J. McManus, Sergeants J. S. Mullen and Henry E. Cross, Corporal McMurry and Privates Daniel Cook, John Bowman, Marion White and Henry Woodruff were killed, with 50 wounded, including Lieutenant Colonel Biggs, Adjutant L. B. Bane, Captains W. E. Adams and Owen Wiley, Lieutenants Alex. McNutt and J. R. Harding.\n\nLate in the war, the regiment pursued Confederate General [[John Bell Hood]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.16thconfederatecavalry.com/timelinebattles/rome.html |title=Battle Near Rome, Georgia, October 12, 1864 |access-date=2018-11-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707060209/http://www.16thconfederatecavalry.com/timelinebattles/rome.html |archive-date=2011-07-07 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The unit was instrumental in the capture of former Confederate capital [[Montgomery, Alabama]].\n\nIn June 1865 new recruits and some veterans were transferred to the [[61st Illinois Volunteer Infantry Regiment|61st Regiment]] as the 123rd prepared to disband.<ref name=\"ILNG\">GlobalSecurity.org 1st Battalion, 123d Infantry</ref> Those who remained were mustered out June 27, 1865, by Captain L.

In 2018 the airport handled 1,103,353 passengers and 11,258 flights, far more than in 1995 when it handled only 180,00 passengers. Since then, the traffic has declined following the trend in Spanish airports and the decrease in operations by some of the companies. {{Citation needed|date=April 2015}}\n\n==Name==\n[[File:Santander Airport.jpg|thumb|Entrance to the passenger terminal]]\nThe airport is named after the famous golf player [[Seve Ballesteros]], born in [[Pedre\u00f1a]], a few kilometres from the airport and being one of the most well known public figures of Cantabria in the last century. The airport was known as 'Santander Airport' until 2015. In May 2014, a popular initiative taken to the [[Parliament of Cantabria]] was unanimously approved to change the name after Seve Ballesteros, an icon in sport and life and one of the best ambassadors that Cantabria ever had in the last decades. The Spanish Government approved the change on 16 April 2015 <ref>http://www.eldiariomontanes.es/cantabria/201504/16/parayas-llama-oficialmente-aeropuerto-20150416104406.html</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe current airport, built on ground filled of the bay of Santander, was opened to traffic in 1977. Before there was on the same site a smaller airfield built between 1947 and 1952 by prisoners of the [[Spanish Civil War]]. {{Citation needed|date=May 2015}} It opened in 1953 replacing the old Santander airport located in La Albericia, that was receiving commercial flights since 1949, and received the name of Aeropuerto de Santander and popularly known as \"Parayas\". It received the international rating in 1957. {{citation needed|date=September 2015}}\n\nAfter a three-year closure (from April 1974 until August 8, 1977), in which the airport underwent a major renovation that significantly expanded its facilities and had a cost of more than 1,100 million pesetas of the time; it was reopened with a new 2,400 m runway and with the technology to allow both visual and instrumental flight; the first flight after the renovation corresponded to the [[Iberia]]'s [[DC-9]] \"Ciudad de Santander\", that covered the [[Barcelona]]-Santander-[[Santiago de Compostela]] route. {{citation needed|date=September 2015}}\n\nIn recent years there have been new renovation works, that started in 2007, remodeling and expanding the terminal and installing two gateways or fingers for direct access to the planes, widening the platform for parking more aircraft or construction of taxiways and a platform for general aviation.<ref>http://eleconomista.es/mercados-cotizaciones/noticias/132266/07/07/Economia-Transportes-AENA-licita-obras-en-el-aeropuerto-de-Santander-por-mas-de-20-millones-de-euros.html</ref>\n\nUntil 2003 the premises were considered underused due to the limited number of flights and their high fees, which made a shift in potential passengers to the [[Bilbao Airport|airport of Bilbao]], 100&nbsp;km away. From this date, following an agreement signed between the [[Government of Cantabria]] and the budget airline [[Ryanair]], the airport experimented an increase in the number of destinations (national and international), passengers and airlines operating. In 2005 the airport reached 644,662 passengers, growing by 88% over the previous year and having a user balance between domestic and international flights. {{citation needed|date=June 2015}} This increase was the largest proportion of all airports in Spain in that year.\n\nIn December 2010, for the upgrading of the facilities 37.8 million euros were invested, preparing the airport hold an annual traffic of over two million passengers a year. The works included the remodeling of the terminal building of 10,200 m2, expanding new areas of departures and arrivals as well as the construction of a taxiway that can handle 22 movements per hour, and the extension of the aircraft parking platform.<ref>http://www.eldiariomontanes.es/v/20101217/santander/destacados/aeropuerto-parayas-estrena-instalaciones-20101217.html</ref>\n\n==Facilities==\nAfter the implementation of the renovations referred to in the Airport Master Plan, today it has 8 check-in desks, 3 baggage carousels in the arrivals lounge and 5 boarding gates. As an international airport, it is also capable of handling flights from countries outside the [[Schengen treaty|Schengen zone]].<ref name=open>[https://archive.is/20130213034634/http://www.aena-aeropuertos.es/santander/en Santander Official Airport website].

In 2018 the airport handled 1,103,353 passengers and 11,258 flights, far more than in 1995 when it handled only 180,00 passengers. Since then, the traffic has declined following the trend in Spanish airports and the decrease in operations by some of the companies. {{Citation needed|date=April 2015}}\n\n==Name==\n[[File:Santander Airport.jpg|thumb|Entrance to the passenger terminal]]\nThe airport is named after the famous golf player [[Seve Ballesteros]], born in [[Pedre\u00f1a]], a few kilometres from the airport and being one of the most well known public figures of Cantabria in the last century. The airport was known as 'Santander Airport' until 2015. In May 2014, a popular initiative taken to the [[Parliament of Cantabria]] was unanimously approved to change the name after Seve Ballesteros, an icon in sport and life and one of the best ambassadors that Cantabria ever had in the last decades. The Spanish Government approved the change on 16 April 2015 <ref>http://www.eldiariomontanes.es/cantabria/201504/16/parayas-llama-oficialmente-aeropuerto-20150416104406.html</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe current airport, built on ground filled of the bay of Santander, was opened to traffic in 1977. Before there was on the same site a smaller airfield built between 1947 and 1952 by prisoners of the [[Spanish Civil War]]. {{Citation needed|date=May 2015}} It opened in 1953 replacing the old Santander airport located in La Albericia, that was receiving commercial flights since 1949, and received the name of Aeropuerto de Santander and popularly known as \"Parayas\". It received the international rating in 1957. {{citation needed|date=September 2015}}\n\nAfter a three-year closure (from April 1974 until August 8, 1977), in which the airport underwent a major renovation that significantly expanded its facilities and had a cost of more than 1,100 million pesetas of the time; it was reopened with a new 2,400 m runway and with the technology to allow both visual and instrumental flight; the first flight after the renovation corresponded to the [[Iberia]]'s [[DC-9]] \"Ciudad de Santander\", that covered the [[Barcelona]]-Santander-[[Santiago de Compostela]] route. {{citation needed|date=September 2015}}\n\nIn recent years there have been new renovation works, that started in 2007, remodeling and expanding the terminal and installing two gateways or fingers for direct access to the planes, widening the platform for parking more aircraft or construction of taxiways and a platform for general aviation.<ref>http://eleconomista.es/mercados-cotizaciones/noticias/132266/07/07/Economia-Transportes-AENA-licita-obras-en-el-aeropuerto-de-Santander-por-mas-de-20-millones-de-euros.html</ref>\n\nUntil 2003 the premises were considered underused due to the limited number of flights and their high fees, which made a shift in potential passengers to the [[Bilbao Airport|airport of Bilbao]], 100&nbsp;km away. From this date, following an agreement signed between the [[Government of Cantabria]] and the budget airline [[Ryanair]], the airport experimented an increase in the number of destinations (national and international), passengers and airlines operating. In 2005 the airport reached 644,662 passengers, growing by 88% over the previous year and having a user balance between domestic and international flights. {{citation needed|date=June 2015}} This increase was the largest proportion of all airports in Spain in that year.\n\nIn December 2010, for the upgrading of the facilities 37.8 million euros were invested, preparing the airport hold an annual traffic of over two million passengers a year. The works included the remodeling of the terminal building of 10,200 m2, expanding new areas of departures and arrivals as well as the construction of a taxiway that can handle 22 movements per hour, and the extension of the aircraft parking platform.<ref>http://www.eldiariomontanes.es/v/20101217/santander/destacados/aeropuerto-parayas-estrena-instalaciones-20101217.html</ref>\n\n==Facilities==\nAfter the implementation of the renovations referred to in the Airport Master Plan, today it has 8 check-in desks, 3 baggage carousels in the arrivals lounge and 5 boarding gates. As an international airport, it is also capable of handling flights from countries outside the [[Schengen treaty|Schengen zone]].<ref name=open>[https://archive.is/20130213034634/http://www.aena-aeropuertos.es/santander/en Santander Official Airport website].

Initially, the bridge was repaired through a $30.9 million contract with Boh Brothers Construction Company.  However, Louisiana has since replaced the bridge with two higher elevation spans in 2009 and 2010.\n\n==Route description==\nFrom [[Texas]] to [[Lafayette, Louisiana|Lafayette]], I-10 parallels the older [[U.S. Route 90 in Louisiana |US Highway&nbsp;90]] (US&nbsp;90) corridor. From Lafayette, the highway heads east-northeast toward Baton Rouge via the [[Atchafalaya Basin Bridge|Atchafalaya Swamp Freeway]], an {{convert|18.2|mi|km|adj=on}} bridge across the [[Atchafalaya Basin|Atchafalaya River and its accompanying swamp]]. Between the two cities, I-10 parallels [[U.S. Route 190|US&nbsp;190]], from [[Opelousas, Louisiana|Opelousas]] to Baton Rouge. This route has signs and is designated as an alternate I-10 by-pass that runs from I-10/I-49 north to US&nbsp;190 (exit 19B at Opelousas) then east across to Baton Rouge and back down to I-10 via I-110 south. Traffic can be diverted both ways along this route should there be the necessity to close I-10 across the Atchafalaya Swamp Freeway and is also used as a hurricane evacuation route.\n\n[[File:The I-10, running west of New Orleans.jpg|thumb|left|I-10 running west of New Orleans, spanning the Bonnet Carre Spillway at Lake Pontchartrain]]\nIn the capital of Baton Rouge, US&nbsp;190 continues east alongside [[Interstate 12|I-12]] to [[Hammond, Louisiana|Hammond]] and [[Slidell, Louisiana|Slidell]] while I-10 turns southeastward and parallels [[U.S. Route 61]] ([[Airline Highway]]) to [[New Orleans, Louisiana|New Orleans]]. In the Crescent City, I-10 rejoins US&nbsp;90 (and later [[U.S. Route 11 in Louisiana|US&nbsp;11]]) as it heads toward [[Slidell, Louisiana|Slidell]]. In Slidell, US&nbsp;11 continues northeastward toward [[Hattiesburg, Mississippi]] while I-10 and US&nbsp;90 turn eastward toward coastal [[Mississippi]].\n\nMajor bridges on I-10 in Louisiana include the [[Interstate 10 bridge (Sabine River)|Sabine River Bridge]] (c. 1952, replaced 2003), the [[Lake Charles I-10 Bridge]] (1952), the Atchafalaya Swamp Freeway (1973), the [[Horace Wilkinson Bridge]] over the [[Mississippi River]] (1968), the [[I-10 Bonnet Carr\u00e9 Spillway Bridge|Bonnet Carr\u00e9 Spillway Bridge]] (c. 1972), the [[I-10 High Rise Bridge|Industrial Canal Bridge]] (c. 1960), [[I-10 Twin Span Bridge|Frank Davis \"Naturally N'Awlins\" Memorial Bridge]] (1965, replaced 2010), and the [[Interstate 10 bridge (Pearl River)|Pearl River Bridge]] (c. 1970).\n\n[[File:Interstate 10 eastbound over Lake Charles (LA).jpg|thumb|right|I-10 eastbound passing over Lake Charles/Calcasieu River near Lake Charles]]\n\n==History==\n[[File:New Orleans, Louisiana 1955 Yellow Book.jpg|thumb|Until around 1960, I-10 and I-59 would have split near the present [I-510 interchange in eastern New Orleans.]]\nBy the beginning of planning for the [[Interstate Highway System]] in 1939 (then called the Interregional Highway System), the [[Houston, Texas|Houston]]-New Orleans-[[Mobile, Alabama|Mobile]] corridor was part of the system.

This would have provided a shorter route than I-10, bypassing Baton Rouge to the south.  The [[Gramercy Bridge]] was later built along its planned alignment, with [[Louisiana Highway 3125|LA 3125]] connecting to Gramercy, but no road extends west from the bridge across the Atchafalaya Swamp to Lafayette.\n\n[[File:I-10 LA 127.5mi.jpg|thumb|left|Atchafalaya Swamp Freeway in Iberville Parish]]\n[[File:Int10eRoadLA-Exit267AB-Int59-Int12w (33070048911).jpg|thumb|left|Interchange between I-10, I-12, and I-59 in Slidell]]\nI-12, serving as a bypass of New Orleans around the north side of Lake Pontchartrain, was not added until October 17, 1957.  At the time, I-10 and [[Interstate 59 (Louisiana)|Interstate 59]] split in eastern New Orleans, with I-59 following present I-10 and I-10 following the US&nbsp;90 corridor into Mississippi, and so I-12 only ran to I-59 north of Slidell.<ref name=\"October 1957 Interstates\">{{cite map |author= Public Roads Administration |url= //commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Interstate_Highway_plan_October_17,_1957_reverse_colors.jpg |title= Routes To Be Added to the National System of Interstate and Defense Highways |date= October 17, 1957 |scale = Scale not given |location = Washington, DC |publisher = Public Roads Administration |access-date= August 15, 2012}}</ref>  By the mid-1960s, the routes had been realigned to their current configuration, with I-12 and I-59 both ending at I-10 near Slidell.<ref>{{cite map |author= Public Roads Administration |url= //commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Interstate_Highway_status_unknown_date.jpg |title= The National System of Interstate and Defense Highways |year= c. 1963 |scale = Scale not given |location = Washington, DC |publisher = Public Roads Administration |access-date= August 15, 2012}}</ref>\n\nConstruction of the Interstate Highway System in Louisiana began in 1957.<ref name=\"S-T 8-7-57\">{{cite news |title=Federal funds for roads |newspaper=State-Times |location=Baton Rouge |date=August 7, 1957 |page=8A}}</ref>  Early I-10 contracts were done under the route designation [[Louisiana Highway 3027|LA 3027]].  Much of the early construction on the I-10 corridor was concentrated on relieving traffic problems in urban centers.  Several such projects were already underway and were incorporated into the route of I-10 during construction, such as the [[Pontchartrain Expressway]] in New Orleans.  In addition, the two major bridges on the route in [[Calcasieu Parish, Louisiana|Calcasieu Parish]] between the Texas state line and Lake Charles were built for US&nbsp;90 in the early 1950s and retrofitted for I-10 traffic.  Sections of I-10 through rural areas and/or those sections already served adequately by existing highways, such as Airline Highway (US&nbsp;61) between Baton Rouge and New Orleans, were constructed later in the program.  By the spring of 1975, the entire route of I-10 had been opened across Louisiana except for a problem 5.5 mile section between [[Gonzales, Louisiana|Gonzales]] and [[Sorrento, Louisiana|Sorrento]] that was not completed for another three years.\n\n{{prose|date=January 2017}}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

aftermath of [[Hurricane Katrina]], the I-10 Twin Span Bridge, a portion of I-10 between New Orleans and Slidell, spanning the eastern end of Lake Pontchartrain, was severely damaged, causing a break in I-10 at that point.  Unlike the [[Escambia Bay Bridge]] (east of [[Pensacola, Florida|Pensacola]], [[Florida]] and damaged by Hurricane Ivan) which is a major artery, I-12 is available to bypass New Orleans.  Taking I-12 to the [[Lake Ponchartrain Causeway]] allowed entry and exit to and from the [[Greater New Orleans]] area from the East.  On October 14, 2005 at 3:00 PM, the eastbound span was reopened to two way traffic.  On January 6, 2006 at 6:00 AM, both lanes of the westbound span were reopened to traffic using temporary metal trusses and road panels to replace damaged sections.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://public.fotki.com/apjung/roadgeeking/hurricane_katrina/6/ |title=6 album &#124; Andy's Category 6 (& more) Photo Gallery &#124; Fotki.com, photo and video sharing made easy |publisher=Public.fotki.com |date= July 13, 2005 |access-date= September 19, 2011}}{{unreliable source?|failed=y|date= August 2012}}</ref>  This restored all four lanes of the I-10 Twin Span for normal traffic with a 45&nbsp;mph (70&nbsp;km/h) speed limit for the westbound lanes and 60&nbsp;mph (100&nbsp;km/h) for the eastbound lanes.

Initially, the bridge was repaired through a $30.9 million contract with Boh Brothers Construction Company.  However, Louisiana has since replaced the bridge with two higher elevation spans in 2009 and 2010.\n\n==Route description==\nFrom [[Texas]] to [[Lafayette, Louisiana|Lafayette]], I-10 parallels the older [[U.S. Route 90 in Louisiana |US Highway&nbsp;90]] (US&nbsp;90) corridor. From Lafayette, the highway heads east-northeast toward Baton Rouge via the [[Atchafalaya Basin Bridge|Atchafalaya Swamp Freeway]], an {{convert|18.2|mi|km|adj=on}} bridge across the [[Atchafalaya Basin|Atchafalaya River and its accompanying swamp]]. Between the two cities, I-10 parallels [[U.S. Route 190|US&nbsp;190]], from [[Opelousas, Louisiana|Opelousas]] to Baton Rouge. This route has signs and is designated as an alternate I-10 by-pass that runs from I-10/I-49 north to US&nbsp;190 (exit 19B at Opelousas) then east across to Baton Rouge and back down to I-10 via I-110 south. Traffic can be diverted both ways along this route should there be the necessity to close I-10 across the Atchafalaya Swamp Freeway and is also used as a hurricane evacuation route.\n\n[[File:The I-10, running west of New Orleans.jpg|thumb|left|I-10 running west of New Orleans, spanning the Bonnet Carre Spillway at Lake Pontchartrain]]\nIn the capital of Baton Rouge, US&nbsp;190 continues east alongside [[Interstate 12|I-12]] to [[Hammond, Louisiana|Hammond]] and [[Slidell, Louisiana|Slidell]] while I-10 turns southeastward and parallels [[U.S. Route 61]] ([[Airline Highway]]) to [[New Orleans, Louisiana|New Orleans]]. In the Crescent City, I-10 rejoins US&nbsp;90 (and later [[U.S. Route 11 in Louisiana|US&nbsp;11]]) as it heads toward [[Slidell, Louisiana|Slidell]]. In Slidell, US&nbsp;11 continues northeastward toward [[Hattiesburg, Mississippi]] while I-10 and US&nbsp;90 turn eastward toward coastal [[Mississippi]].\n\nMajor bridges on I-10 in Louisiana include the [[Interstate 10 bridge (Sabine River)|Sabine River Bridge]] (c. 1952, replaced 2003), the [[Lake Charles I-10 Bridge]] (1952), the Atchafalaya Swamp Freeway (1973), the [[Horace Wilkinson Bridge]] over the [[Mississippi River]] (1968), the [[I-10 Bonnet Carr\u00e9 Spillway Bridge|Bonnet Carr\u00e9 Spillway Bridge]] (c. 1972), the [[I-10 High Rise Bridge|Industrial Canal Bridge]] (c. 1960), [[I-10 Twin Span Bridge|Frank Davis \"Naturally N'Awlins\" Memorial Bridge]] (1965, replaced 2010), and the [[Interstate 10 bridge (Pearl River)|Pearl River Bridge]] (c. 1970).\n\n[[File:Interstate 10 eastbound over Lake Charles (LA).jpg|thumb|right|I-10 eastbound passing over Lake Charles/Calcasieu River near Lake Charles]]\n\n==History==\n[[File:New Orleans, Louisiana 1955 Yellow Book.jpg|thumb|Until around 1960, I-10 and I-59 would have split near the present [I-510 interchange in eastern New Orleans.]]\nBy the beginning of planning for the [[Interstate Highway System]] in 1939 (then called the Interregional Highway System), the [[Houston, Texas|Houston]]-New Orleans-[[Mobile, Alabama|Mobile]] corridor was part of the system.

This would have provided a shorter route than I-10, bypassing Baton Rouge to the south.  The [[Gramercy Bridge]] was later built along its planned alignment, with [[Louisiana Highway 3125|LA 3125]] connecting to Gramercy, but no road extends west from the bridge across the Atchafalaya Swamp to Lafayette.\n\n[[File:I-10 LA 127.5mi.jpg|thumb|left|Atchafalaya Swamp Freeway in Iberville Parish]]\n[[File:Int10eRoadLA-Exit267AB-Int59-Int12w (33070048911).jpg|thumb|left|Interchange between I-10, I-12, and I-59 in Slidell]]\nI-12, serving as a bypass of New Orleans around the north side of Lake Pontchartrain, was not added until October 17, 1957.  At the time, I-10 and [[Interstate 59 (Louisiana)|Interstate 59]] split in eastern New Orleans, with I-59 following present I-10 and I-10 following the US&nbsp;90 corridor into Mississippi, and so I-12 only ran to I-59 north of Slidell.<ref name=\"October 1957 Interstates\">{{cite map |author= Public Roads Administration |url= //commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Interstate_Highway_plan_October_17,_1957_reverse_colors.jpg |title= Routes To Be Added to the National System of Interstate and Defense Highways |date= October 17, 1957 |scale = Scale not given |location = Washington, DC |publisher = Public Roads Administration |access-date= August 15, 2012}}</ref>  By the mid-1960s, the routes had been realigned to their current configuration, with I-12 and I-59 both ending at I-10 near Slidell.<ref>{{cite map |author= Public Roads Administration |url= //commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Interstate_Highway_status_unknown_date.jpg |title= The National System of Interstate and Defense Highways |year= c. 1963 |scale = Scale not given |location = Washington, DC |publisher = Public Roads Administration |access-date= August 15, 2012}}</ref>\n\nConstruction of the Interstate Highway System in Louisiana began in 1957.<ref name=\"S-T 8-7-57\">{{cite news |title=Federal funds for roads |newspaper=State-Times |location=Baton Rouge |date=August 7, 1957 |page=8A}}</ref>  Early I-10 contracts were done under the route designation [[Louisiana Highway 3027|LA 3027]].  Much of the early construction on the I-10 corridor was concentrated on relieving traffic problems in urban centers.  Several such projects were already underway and were incorporated into the route of I-10 during construction, such as the [[Pontchartrain Expressway]] in New Orleans.  In addition, the two major bridges on the route in [[Calcasieu Parish, Louisiana|Calcasieu Parish]] between the Texas state line and Lake Charles were built for US&nbsp;90 in the early 1950s and retrofitted for I-10 traffic.  Sections of I-10 through rural areas and/or those sections already served adequately by existing highways, such as Airline Highway (US&nbsp;61) between Baton Rouge and New Orleans, were constructed later in the program.  By the spring of 1975, the entire route of I-10 had been opened across Louisiana except for a problem 5.5 mile section between [[Gonzales, Louisiana|Gonzales]] and [[Sorrento, Louisiana|Sorrento]] that was not completed for another three years.\n\n{{prose|date=January 2017}}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

aftermath of [[Hurricane Katrina]], the I-10 Twin Span Bridge, a portion of I-10 between New Orleans and Slidell, spanning the eastern end of Lake Pontchartrain, was severely damaged, causing a break in I-10 at that point.  Unlike the [[Escambia Bay Bridge]] (east of [[Pensacola, Florida|Pensacola]], [[Florida]] and damaged by Hurricane Ivan) which is a major artery, I-12 is available to bypass New Orleans.  Taking I-12 to the [[Lake Ponchartrain Causeway]] allowed entry and exit to and from the [[Greater New Orleans]] area from the East.  On October 14, 2005 at 3:00 PM, the eastbound span was reopened to two way traffic.  On January 6, 2006 at 6:00 AM, both lanes of the westbound span were reopened to traffic using temporary metal trusses and road panels to replace damaged sections.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://public.fotki.com/apjung/roadgeeking/hurricane_katrina/6/ |title=6 album &#124; Andy's Category 6 (& more) Photo Gallery &#124; Fotki.com, photo and video sharing made easy |publisher=Public.fotki.com |date= July 13, 2005 |access-date= September 19, 2011}}{{unreliable source?|failed=y|date= August 2012}}</ref>  This restored all four lanes of the I-10 Twin Span for normal traffic with a 45&nbsp;mph (70&nbsp;km/h) speed limit for the westbound lanes and 60&nbsp;mph (100&nbsp;km/h) for the eastbound lanes.

Its key source was ''[[The Artist's Magazine|American Artist]]'' magazine (1937-2012), June 2006.</ref> Major advancements in printing techniques were then taking place. This included breakthroughs in the [[halftone]] process. It made the printing of images for commercial usage more economical, feasible, and realistic. The reproduction of art from [[wood engraving]]s (time consuming and strenuous), was largely replaced with [[photoengraving|photo-mechanical engravings]] (higher accuracy level).<ref>''Scribner's Magazine''. \"American Illustration and the Reproductive  Arts\" by Carrington, July 1922 pp. 123-28. (Viewable online at www.unz.com.)</ref> These and other methods were utilized by artist, writer, teacher, innovator\u2013[[Howard Pyle]], who is generally regarded as \"The Father of American Illustration.\"<ref>''The New York Times'', Nov. 10, 1911 p. 11. Obit column. Excerpt: \"He was almost [or like] the father of American magazine illustration, as it is known to-day.\"</ref> Others who gained fame in this field included [[Howard Chandler Christy]], [[Harrison Fisher]], [[James Montgomery Flagg]], [[Charles Dana Gibson]], [[John Held Jr.]], [[J. C. Leyendecker]], [[Maxfield Parrish]], [[Coles Phillips]], [[Frederic Remington]], [[Norman Rockwell]], [[Jessie Willcox Smith]] and [[N. C. Wyeth]].\n\nHowever, the vast majority of illustrators received little recognition, compared to the [[fine art]]ists. This was due to their artwork being viewed as more commercially, than creatively inspired.<ref>''Artists, Advertising, and the Borders of Art'', 1995 pp. 1-3, 47-55. It was just slightly more regarded, than advertising art.</ref> Nonetheless, these unheralded illustrators played a powerful role, in communicating the people's aspirations, concerns, customs, humor, labor, morals and social interests.<ref name=\"historical\">''Cover Story: The Art of American Magazine Covers 1900-1950'' by Heller & Fili, 1996.</ref> One of them was Paul Martin, whose work appeared on the covers of ''[[Collier's]]'', ''[[Everybody's Magazine|Everybody's]]'', ''[[Farm & Fireside]]'', ''[[The Farmer's Wife (women's magazine)|The Farmer's Wife]]'', ''[[Liberty (general interest magazine)|Liberty]]'', ''[[Parents (magazine)|Parents]]'' and ''[[People's Home Journal]]'' from 1923-31. These seven magazines were once ranked among the most widely circulated. They all went out of business long ago, except for ''[[Parents (magazine)|Parents]]''. Their eventual downfall was caused by the changing times (or taste), emergence of radio and television (more attractive medium for advertisers), and economics (increased cost / decreased revenue). The more specialized ones that targeted specific audiences, tended to fare better. Another point is that major advancements in photographic equipment and technology took place during the 1930s. This brought about the gradual changeover (twenty-five+ year process) from illustrated to photographic covers.<ref name=\"historical\"/> The former still lingered on, for its innovative and enchanting qualities, until succumbing to digital media (especially [[Adobe Photoshop|Photoshop]]).\n\n==Collier's==\n[[File:Collier's10-25-24.jpg|thumb|117px|(Calling the play) ''Collier's'' 10-25-1924]]\nGeneral interest magazines (mixture of entertainment, pictures, politics, serials, short stories and sports) were once very popular and appealed to diverse audiences. One of them was the historically significant ''[[Collier's]]'' (founded 1888), which had a revival under new editor [[Collier's#Editors|William L.

There was a nostalgic element to them. Martin excluded the non-essential details (extra people, structures, trees, scenery etc.), which allowed viewers to make an instant connection. His paintings were often easy to recognize, since their theme and style remained fairly consistent. They sometimes gave the illusion of three-dimensional depth. This was through the use of various techniques, such as overlapping, color intensity or variation and [[perspective (graphical)|linear perspective]]. His cover art never corresponded to anything in particular, but rather had a holiday or seasonal theme or portrayed the magazine's overall image (common practice back then).<ref>''Collier's'' usually preferred cover art that conveyed plain and simple thoughts, unlike its main rival in the ''Post''.</ref> Martin mostly hired local boys for the [[photo shoot|photo sessions]].<ref name=\"hard\">''Hard Row to Hoe'' (literary newsletter), V-9 Fall 2005. \"Golden Era of the Illustrations\" pp. 1-3.

He was unwittingly caught up in the famous player-writer dispute of 1924 (overview in reference<ref>''Brooklyn Daily Eagle'', May 11, 1924 pp. 1-2D. The [[United States Tennis Association|USLTA]] adopted the player-writer rule on Feb. 2, 1924. It stated that any active player who received payment for writing on tennis, would be stripped of their amateur status starting Jan. 1, 1925. This resolution was easily approved by its members, who voted in blocks (47,196 to 6,250). It would have most deeply affected Bill Tilden, followed distantly by Vincent Richards. Strong opposition came from the influential [[Stephen Wallis Merrihew|S. Wallis Merrihew]], fans and writers.  A petition was signed by, among others, 12 [not 18] of the top 25 ranked racketmen from the [[New York metropolitan area|NY metro area]]. It rebuked the new rule that redefined amateurism. [[Walter Merrill Hall]] (#11) and Martin (#18) did not sign on with the pro-Tilden forces. They instead wrote a separate letter (full text printed, p. 2D), urging its reconsideration. A special committee of seven was formed, to further study the troubling matter on Nov. 2, 1924. (This was after a months-long selection process, to fill the final three critical spots.) It consisted of Arthur Hellen, Merrihew, Jones Mersereau, [[Devereux Milburn]], Senator [[George W. Pepper|George Pepper]], [[Grantland Rice]] and Tilden. Their report was released on Dec. 13. The USLTA accepted its recommendations, to greatly modify the anti-writing resolution. The alternative was to face continued backlash.</ref>).

A first-hand account by ''New York Times'' sportswriter, [[Allison Danzig]]. Excerpts: \"This afternoon [[Bill Tilden|[Bill] Tilden]] and Strachan advanced from the semi-finals of the doubles, by putting out Alfred D. Hammett and Paul Martin at 6-4, 5-7, 6-1, 6-3. ... It required some of the best tennis that Tilden has played here all week, before the Philadelphians were able to overcome the New York pair. Hammett and Martin were always contenders, except in the third set when they slumped badly; and in order to hold them off, Tilden constantly found it necessary to invade his partner's territory and play the opposing pair single-handed. ... There was nothing to choose between the two teams in the first and second sets. In the third set, Hammett and Martin went to pieces as Tilden became rampant and raked their court with placement drives and volleys. After the Phlladelphians had gained a commanding lead [in that one], the New York pair allowed the set to go without making much effort, preferring to save their strength for the next chapter. But after the rest period, Tilden returned to the courts to play perhaps his best tennis of the match. Both Martin and Hammett fought with everything they had and their team work was splendidly coordinated, but all counted for nought against the individual brilliance of Tilden\" [then ranked [[World number 1 ranked male tennis players|World No. 1]]].<ref name=\"Tilden\"/><ref>''The New York Times'', Sept. 30, 1921 p. 12.

Its key source was ''[[The Artist's Magazine|American Artist]]'' magazine (1937-2012), June 2006.</ref> Major advancements in printing techniques were then taking place. This included breakthroughs in the [[halftone]] process. It made the printing of images for commercial usage more economical, feasible, and realistic. The reproduction of art from [[wood engraving]]s (time consuming and strenuous), was largely replaced with [[photoengraving|photo-mechanical engravings]] (higher accuracy level).<ref>''Scribner's Magazine''. \"American Illustration and the Reproductive  Arts\" by Carrington, July 1922 pp. 123-28. (Viewable online at www.unz.com.)</ref> These and other methods were utilized by artist, writer, teacher, innovator\u2013[[Howard Pyle]], who is generally regarded as \"The Father of American Illustration.\"<ref>''The New York Times'', Nov. 10, 1911 p. 11. Obit column. Excerpt: \"He was almost [or like] the father of American magazine illustration, as it is known to-day.\"</ref> Others who gained fame in this field included [[Howard Chandler Christy]], [[Harrison Fisher]], [[James Montgomery Flagg]], [[Charles Dana Gibson]], [[John Held Jr.]], [[J. C. Leyendecker]], [[Maxfield Parrish]], [[Coles Phillips]], [[Frederic Remington]], [[Norman Rockwell]], [[Jessie Willcox Smith]] and [[N. C. Wyeth]].\n\nHowever, the vast majority of illustrators received little recognition, compared to the [[fine art]]ists. This was basically due to their artwork being viewed as more commercially, than creatively inspired.<ref>''Artists, Advertising, and the Borders of Art'', 1995 pp. 1-3, 47-55. It was just slightly more regarded, than advertising art.</ref> Nonetheless, these unheralded illustrators played a powerful role, in communicating the people's aspirations, concerns, customs, humor, labor, morals and social interests.<ref name=\"historical\">''Cover Story: The Art of American Magazine Covers 1900-1950'' by Heller & Fili, 1996.</ref> One of them was Paul Martin, whose work appeared on the covers of ''[[Collier's]]'', ''[[Everybody's Magazine|Everybody's]]'', ''[[Farm & Fireside]]'', ''[[The Farmer's Wife (women's magazine)|The Farmer's Wife]]'', ''[[Liberty (general interest magazine)|Liberty]]'', ''[[Parents (magazine)|Parents]]'' and ''[[People's Home Journal]]'' from 1923-31. These seven magazines were once ranked among the most widely circulated. They all went out of business long ago, except for ''[[Parents (magazine)|Parents]]''. Their eventual downfall was caused by the changing times (or taste), emergence of radio and television (more attractive medium for advertisers), and economics (increased cost / decreased revenue). The more specialized ones that targeted specific audiences, tended to fare better. Another point is that major advancements in photographic equipment and technology took place during the 1930s. This brought about the gradual changeover (twenty-five+ year process) from illustrated to photographic covers.<ref name=\"historical\"/> The former still lingered on, for its innovative and enchanting qualities, until succumbing to digital media (especially [[Adobe Photoshop|Photoshop]]).\n\n==Collier's==\n[[File:Collier's10-25-24.jpg|thumb|117px|(Calling the play) ''Collier's'' 10-25-1924]]\nGeneral interest magazines (mixture of entertainment, pictures, politics, serials, short stories and sports) were once very popular and appealed to diverse audiences. One of them was the historically significant ''[[Collier's]]'' (founded 1888), which had a revival under new editor [[Collier's#Editors|William L.

There was a nostalgic element to them. Martin excluded the non-essential details (extra people, structures, trees, scenery etc.), which allowed viewers to make an instant connection. His paintings were often easy to recognize, since their theme and style remained fairly consistent. They sometimes gave the illusion of three-dimensional depth. This was through the use of various techniques, such as overlapping, color intensity or variation and [[perspective (graphical)|linear perspective]]. His cover art never corresponded to anything in particular, but rather had a holiday or seasonal theme or portrayed the magazine's overall image (common practice back then).<ref>''Collier's'' usually preferred cover art that conveyed plain and simple thoughts, unlike its main rival in the ''Post''.</ref> Martin mostly hired local boys for the [[photo shoot|photo sessions]].<ref name=\"hard\">''Hard Row to Hoe'' (literary newsletter), V-9 Fall 2005. \"Golden Era of the Illustrations\" pp. 1-3.

He was unwittingly caught up in the famous player-writer dispute of 1924 (overview in reference<ref>''Brooklyn Daily Eagle'', May 11, 1924 pp. 1-2D. The [[United States Tennis Association|USLTA]] adopted the player-writer rule on Feb. 2, 1924. It stated that any active player who received payment for writing on tennis, would be stripped of their amateur status starting Jan. 1, 1925. This resolution was easily approved by its members, who voted in blocks (47,196 to 6,250). It would have most deeply affected Bill Tilden, followed distantly by Vincent Richards. Strong opposition came from the influential [[Stephen Wallis Merrihew|S. Wallis Merrihew]], fans and writers.  A petition was signed by, among others, 12 [not 18] of the top 25 ranked racketmen from the [[New York metropolitan area|NY metro area]]. It rebuked the new rule that redefined amateurism. [[Walter Merrill Hall]] (#11) and Martin (#18) did not sign on with the pro-Tilden forces. They instead wrote a separate letter (full text printed, p. 2D), urging its reconsideration. A special committee of seven was formed, to further study the troubling matter on Nov. 2, 1924. (This was after a months-long selection process, to fill the final three critical spots.) It consisted of Arthur Hellen, Merrihew, Jones Mersereau, [[Devereux Milburn]], Senator [[George W. Pepper|George Pepper]], [[Grantland Rice]] and Tilden. Their report was released on Dec. 13. The USLTA accepted its recommendations, to greatly modify the anti-writing resolution. The alternative was to face continued backlash.</ref>).

A first-hand account by ''New York Times'' sportswriter, [[Allison Danzig]]. Excerpts: \"This afternoon [[Bill Tilden|[Bill] Tilden]] and Strachan advanced from the semi-finals of the doubles, by putting out Alfred D. Hammett and Paul Martin at 6-4, 5-7, 6-1, 6-3. ... It required some of the best tennis that Tilden has played here all week, before the Philadelphians were able to overcome the New York pair. Hammett and Martin were always contenders, except in the third set when they slumped badly; and in order to hold them off, Tilden constantly found it necessary to invade his partner's territory and play the opposing pair single-handed. ... There was nothing to choose between the two teams in the first and second sets. In the third set, Hammett and Martin went to pieces as Tilden became rampant and raked their court with placement drives and volleys. After the Phlladelphians had gained a commanding lead [in that one], the New York pair allowed the set to go without making much effort, preferring to save their strength for the next chapter. But after the rest period, Tilden returned to the courts to play perhaps his best tennis of the match. Both Martin and Hammett fought with everything they had and their team work was splendidly coordinated, but all counted for nought against the individual brilliance of Tilden\" [then ranked [[World number 1 ranked male tennis players|World No. 1]]].<ref name=\"Tilden\"/><ref>''The New York Times'', Sept. 30, 1921 p. 12.

It begins in [[Elkhart, Kansas|Elkhart]] near the [[Oklahoma]] state line and travels through the seven counties that border Colorado until reaching its northern terminus in [[Cheyenne County, Kansas|Cheyenne County]] north of [[St. Francis, Kansas|St. Francis]], where it ends at the [[Nebraska]] state line (effectively becoming like-numbered [[Nebraska Highway 27]]).\n\n==Route description==\nK-27 begins at [[U.S. Route 56 in Kansas|US-56]] northeast of [[Elkhart, Kansas|Elkhart]], crosses the [[Cimarron Valley Railroad]], and begins travelling westward. After about {{convert|1|mi|km|spell=in}} it curves to the north, and continues {{convert|6.5|mi|km}}, then crosses the [[Cimarron River (Arkansas River)|Cimarron River]]. From here it continues another {{convert|1.5|mi|km}}, where [[K-51 (Kansas highway)|K-51]] joins from the west. The two routes continue north for about {{convert|5.5|mi|km}}, where it crosses the [[North Fork Cimarron River]]. Another {{convert|2.5|mi|km}} past the river the two routes curve to the east, towards [[Richfield, Kansas|Richfoeld]]. In Richfield, K-51 continues east, where K-27 turns north onto Main Street. The highway continues north out of the city, for {{convert|11|mi|km|spell=in}} then enters into [[Stanton County, Kansas|Stanton County]]. From the county line, K-27 continues northward about {{convert|7.8|mi|km}}, where it crosses [[Sand Arroyo Creek]]. From here the highway continues north to the Johnson city line, crosses the Cimarron Valley Railroad, and recieves US-160 from the west. The two routes continue north along the west side of the city for {{convert|1|mi|km|spell=in}}, then US-160 leaves to the east. K-27 continues north from here {{convert|3.5|mi|km}}, then crosses Bear Creek. About {{convert|7.5|mi|km}} north from the creek, the highway enters [[Hamilton County, Kansas|Hamilton County]].\n\n===Time zones===\nThe highway changes time zones not once, but twice, during its trek through Kansas, the only highway in the state to do so. [[Central Standard Time]] is observed in Morton and Stanton Counties after entering from Oklahoma, but the time zone changes to [[Mountain Standard Time]] when the highway crosses from Stanton into Hamilton County. Hamilton and the next three counties to the north (Greeley, Wallace, and Sherman) observe Mountain time, but clocks revert to Central Time at the Sherman County-Cheyenne County line.\n\n==Concurrencies==\nThe highway has a seven-mile (11&nbsp;km) overlap with [[U.S. Route 36 (Kansas)|US-36]], the major east&ndash;west route through the northernmost counties of Kansas. The overlap runs through the town of St. Francis before K-27 continues north towards Nebraska and US-36 heads west to Colorado. In Goodland, the highway briefly shares a route with [[U.S. Business 24]], spur of [[U.S. Route 24 (Kansas)|US-24]] which runs through downtown Goodland.\n\n[[File:K-27South and US-400+US-50East.jpg|thumb|left|K-27 concurrent with US-50 and US-400 in Syracuse]]\nK-27 also makes a brief jog along a half-mile overlap with [[U.S. Route 50 in Kansas|US-50]] and [[U.S. Route 400 in Kansas|US-400]] in [[Syracuse, Kansas|Syracuse]]. US-160 and K-27 also meet briefly in [[Johnson City, Kansas|Johnson City]]; however, K-27 remains along its alignment during this overlap.\n\nThe only overlap with another state highway is with [[K-51 (Kansas highway)|K-51]], an east&ndash;west route, in Morton County in [[Richfield, Kansas|Richfield]].\n\n==History==\nK-27 was first designated as a state highway in 1927. At that time it ran from the Oklahoma state line, north then east to Richfield. It then turned north and then intersected K-46 then US-50 shorltly after in Syracuse. It then continued north to K-96 in Tribune, then reached US-40S in Sharon Springs. It continued north, intersecting US-40N in Goodland, before reaching K-2. K-2 and K-27 then overlapped from Wheeler to St Francis. In St Francis the two routes split, and K-27 headed north and soon crossed into Nebraska.<ref name=1927rm/>\n\nIn a July 23, 1935 resolution, the alignment of K-27 was straightened to eliminate sharp curves, within Sharon Springs.<ref name=1935resolution>{{cite web |author = State Highway Commission of Kansas |date = July 23, 1935 |url = http://dmsweb.ksdot.org/AppNetProd/docpop/pdfpop.aspx?KT142_0_0_0=003711113&clienttype=html&doctypeid=114 |title = Resolution for relocation and redesignation of road in Wallace County |location = Topeka |publisher = State Highway Commission of Kansas |access-date = April 24, 2020}}</ref> In a June 6, 1936 resolution, K-27 was realigned slightly in Stanton in Stanton County.<ref name=1936resolution>{{cite web |author = State Highway Commission of Kansas |date = March 18, 1940 |url = http://dmsweb.ksdot.org/AppNetProd/docpop/pdfpop.aspx?KT142_0_0_0=003710816&clienttype=html&doctypeid=114 |title = Resolution for relocation and redesignation of road in Stanton County |location = Topeka |publisher = State Highway Commission of Kansas |access-date = April 24, 2020}}</ref> In a January 26, 1937 resolution, it was realigned where it crosses the [[Smoky Hill River]], in order to eliminate a bad drainage condition caused by several small branches coverging with the main river.<ref name=1937resolution>{{cite web |author = State Highway Commission of Kansas |date = January 26, 1937 |url = http://dmsweb.ksdot.org/AppNetProd/docpop/pdfpop.aspx?KT142_0_0_0=003710778&clienttype=html&doctypeid=114 |title = Resolution for relocation and redesignation of road in Sherman County |location = Topeka |publisher = State Highway Commission of Kansas |access-date = April 24, 2020}}</ref> Between February 1937 and January 1938, [[U.S. Route 270 in Kansas|US-270]] was extended into Kansas, and overlapped K-27 from Johnson north to US-50 in Syracuse, where it terminated.<ref name=1937ksm>{{cite map |author = State Highway Commission of Kansas |year = 1937 |url = http://www.ksdot.org/Assets/wwwksdotorg/bureaus/burTransPlan/maps/HistoricStateMaps/1937Mapside.pdf |title = Kansas State Highway System |scale = Scale not given |location = Topeka |publisher = State Highway Commission of Kansas |oclc =  |access-date = April 24, 2020 }}</ref><ref name=1938ksm>{{cite map |author = State Highway Commission of Kansas |year = 1938 |url = http://www.ksdot.org/Assets/wwwksdotorg/bureaus/burTransPlan/maps/HistoricStateMaps/1938JanuaryMapside.pdf |title = Kansas State Highway System |scale = Scale not given |location = Topeka |publisher = State Highway Commission of Kansas |oclc =  |access-date = April 24, 2020 }}</ref> This overlap lasted until 1981, and in a May 18, 1981 resolution, the US-270 designation was removed.<ref name=1981resolution>{{cite web |author = State Highway Commission of Kansas |date = January 4, 1939 |url = http://dmsweb.ksdot.org/AppNetProd/docpop/pdfpop.aspx?KT142_0_0_0=003710811&clienttype=html&doctypeid=114 |title = Resolution to withdraw a US Numbered Route from the State Highway System in several counties in Kansas |location = Topeka |publisher = State Highway Commission of Kansas |access-date = April 24, 2020}}</ref> In a March 20, 1937 resolution, the intersection with K-96 in tribune was reconstructed.<ref name=Tribune1937resolution>{{cite web |author = State Highway Commission of Kansas |date = March 20, 1937 |url = http://dmsweb.ksdot.org/AppNetProd/docpop/pdfpop.aspx?KT142_0_0_0=003709603&clienttype=html&doctypeid=114 |title = Resolution for addition of curves to the State Highway System |location = Topeka |publisher = State Highway Commission of Kansas |access-date = April 24, 2020}}</ref> In a March 18, 1940 resolution, K-27 was realigned slightly within Richfield and Stanton in Morton County, to eliminate sharp curves.<ref name=1940resolution>{{cite web |author = State Highway Commission of Kansas |date = March 18, 1940 |url = http://dmsweb.ksdot.org/AppNetProd/docpop/pdfpop.aspx?KT142_0_0_0=003710052&clienttype=html&doctypeid=114 |title = Resolution for relocation and redesignation of road in Morton County |location = Topeka |publisher = State Highway Commission of Kansas |access-date = April 24, 2020}}</ref> Before 1950, K-27 zig-zagged from St. Francis northwestward.

It begins in [[Elkhart, Kansas|Elkhart]] near the [[Oklahoma]] state line and travels through the seven counties that border Colorado until reaching its northern terminus in [[Cheyenne County, Kansas|Cheyenne County]] north of [[St. Francis, Kansas|St. Francis]], where it ends at the [[Nebraska]] state line (effectively becoming like-numbered [[Nebraska Highway 27]]).\n\n==Route description==\nK-27 begins at [[U.S. Route 56 in Kansas|US-56]] northeast of [[Elkhart, Kansas|Elkhart]], crosses the [[Cimarron Valley Railroad]], and begins travelling westward. After about {{convert|1|mi|km|spell=in}} it curves to the north, and continues {{convert|6.5|mi|km}}, then crosses the [[Cimarron River]]. From here it continues another {{convert|1.5|mi|km}}, where [[K-51 (Kansas highway)|K-51]] joins from the west. The two routes continue north for about {{convert|5.5|mi|km}}, where it crosses the [[North Fork Cimarron River]]. Another {{convert|2.5|mi|km}} past the river the two routes curve to the east, towards [[Richfield, Kansas|Richfoeld]]. In Richfield, K-51 continues east, where K-27 turns north onto Main Street. The highway continues north out of the city, for {{convert|11|mi|km|spell=in}} then enters into [[Stanton County, Kansas|Stanton County]]. From the county line, K-27 continues northward about {{convert|7.8|mi|km}}, where it crosses [[Sand Arroyo Creek]]. From here the highway continues north to the Johnson city line, crosses the Cimarron Valley Railroad, and recieves US-160 from the west. The two routes continue north along the west side of the city for {{convert|1|mi|km|spell=in}}, then US-160 leaves to the east. K-27 continues north from here {{convert|3.5|mi|km}}, then crosses Bear Creek. About {{convert|7.5|mi|km}} north from the creek, the highway enters [[Hamilton County, Kansas|Hamilton County]].\n\n===Time zones===\nThe highway changes time zones not once, but twice, during its trek through Kansas, the only highway in the state to do so. [[Central Standard Time]] is observed in Morton and Stanton Counties after entering from Oklahoma, but the time zone changes to [[Mountain Standard Time]] when the highway crosses from Stanton into Hamilton County. Hamilton and the next three counties to the north (Greeley, Wallace, and Sherman) observe Mountain time, but clocks revert to Central Time at the Sherman County-Cheyenne County line.\n\n==Concurrencies==\nThe highway has a seven-mile (11&nbsp;km) overlap with [[U.S. Route 36 (Kansas)|US-36]], the major east&ndash;west route through the northernmost counties of Kansas. The overlap runs through the town of St. Francis before K-27 continues north towards Nebraska and US-36 heads west to Colorado. In Goodland, the highway briefly shares a route with [[U.S. Business 24]], spur of [[U.S. Route 24 (Kansas)|US-24]] which runs through downtown Goodland.\n\n[[File:K-27South and US-400+US-50East.jpg|thumb|left|K-27 concurrent with US-50 and US-400 in Syracuse]]\nK-27 also makes a brief jog along a half-mile overlap with [[U.S. Route 50 in Kansas|US-50]] and [[U.S. Route 400 in Kansas|US-400]] in [[Syracuse, Kansas|Syracuse]]. US-160 and K-27 also meet briefly in [[Johnson City, Kansas|Johnson City]]; however, K-27 remains along its alignment during this overlap.\n\nThe only overlap with another state highway is with [[K-51 (Kansas highway)|K-51]], an east&ndash;west route, in Morton County in [[Richfield, Kansas|Richfield]].\n\n==History==\nK-27 was first designated as a state highway in 1927. At that time it ran from the Oklahoma state line, north then east to Richfield. It then turned north and then intersected K-46 then US-50 shorltly after in Syracuse. It then continued north to K-96 in Tribune, then reached US-40S in Sharon Springs. It continued north, intersecting US-40N in Goodland, before reaching K-2.

When it reached the area as planned, at 15:53 [[Eastern European Summer Time|local time]] (12:53&nbsp;UTC), [[Dnipropetrovsk]] Air Control (''Dnipro Control'') asked MH17 if they could climb to FL 350 as planned, and also to avoid a potential [[Conflict (air traffic control)|separation conflict]] with another flight, [[Singapore Airlines]] Flight 351 (SQ351), also at FL 330.

This request was also approved by ''Dnipro Control'' [[Air traffic control|ATC]].

At 16:19 local time (13:19 UTC), ''Dnipro Control'' noticed that the flight was {{convert|3.6|nmi|km}} north of the centreline of approved airway and instructed MH17 to return to the track. At 16:19 local time (13:19&nbsp;UTC), ''Dnipro Control'' contacted Russian ATC in [[Rostov-on-Don]] (''RND Control'') by telephone and requested clearance to transfer the flight to Russian [[airspace]]. After obtaining the permission, ''Dnipro Control'' attempted to contact MH17 for handing them off to ''RND Control'' at 16:20 local time (13:20&nbsp;UTC), but the aircraft did not respond. When MH17 did not respond to several calls, ''Dnipro Control'' contacted ''RND Control'' again to check if they could see the aircraft on their radar.
