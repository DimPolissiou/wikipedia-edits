From Eastern and Northern Vitilevu and Verata the migration would have occurred over hundreds of years. The migration continued to Vanua Levu where political formations evolved . Records by missionaries and other outsiders present in Fiji post 1840s focuses on folklore vividly remembered through oral history; recorded from chiefs and''talatalas''' or missionaries. Note though, some history of Fiji told through 'folklore' were suppressed by early colonial masters until later in the 20th century when many ''itaukeis'' became literate to log songs and events told by their elders.\n\nThe people of Laucala were led by Mai Vunibua (possibly  Naulumatua from Bua after leaving his two sons in Bua) who finally settled in Northern Taveuni Islands, Qamea and Laucala Islands and the smaller Northern Lau islands. Mai Vunibua originally settled in Nauluvatu (and Navosailagi (Speaker to the heaven) a fortified village (destroyed during the building of Laucala Resort) on Laucala Island. Mai Vunibua had seven sons (Mana'o tea-tea, Mai Sau-ana, Ta-bareva, Le'a, Lagi ni' Oro, Tu-i-Domoniwai and Dela-i-'Amou) \n\n [[File:Qaraniyaku - By Shelly Sayes - Cakaudrove Ideology and Reality in a Fijian Confederation.png|thumb]]\n'''The Yavusa - Vua-ni-cau.''' Mana'o tea-tea (Wainivava) people spread out to Northern Taveuni with a major settlement on Naselesele/Narova over Matei overlooking the waters off North-South Taveuni. Narova in Laucala overlooked the waters to the North and linked to Narova/Naselesele.  \n\n'''Vuanicau Hierarchy''' - After Mai Vunibua, The '''''Vuanicau Yavusa''''' leadership succession was as follows:  '''''Mana'o tea-tea''<nowiki/>'s''' mother may have been of Polynesian blood.  He was istalled '''''<nowiki/>'Vunivalu'<nowiki/>''''' and led the people until his death. '''Ta-bareva (Qilo)''' remained on Southern Laucala Island and later Yanuca Island. '''''Le'a (Cau-Leve)''''' moved to Northern outer islands. '''''Lagi ni' Oro (Lomanikoro)''''' moved to Northern outer islands. '''''Tu-i-Domoniwai (Nasau)''''' settled on North of Qamea in Vidomoni and South '''''(Namata and Vatu-ni- (sogosogo) Lagi''''' - thrashing stone for rain) of Island.  '''''Dela-i-'Amou (Delaiamou)''''' settled on Qamea Island. \n\nVua'ta'i (descendant of Mai Sau-ana (Qara-ni-yau (yaku)[https://www.facebook.com/TogoVillageQameaIslandFiji/?rc=p]) was installed as Vunivalu after Mana'o tea-tea; the people (Qara-ni-yau (yaku)  remained in Laucala Island until the arrival of Waqanawanawa (originally known as Vua-ni-Sinu after returning from a visit to kin clan of Daunisai in Kabara).  Waqanawanawa accompanied by Mai-Naulusole and Mai-Nabuadugu of the Vuanisinu clan (Cakaudrove i Wai). \n\nEmpirical research by Shelly Sayes (Australian National University) in 1979, shed light to the history of the Laucala people originating from Mai Vunibua possibly Naulumatua. The research which collected 'story lines' from sub-chiefs from Cakaudrove, tells of possible parallel waves of migration from Verata by Naulumatua ( and others such as Waqanawanawa and brother Ului [who became Ului of Lakeba] ) to Vanua Levu, Northern Taveuni islands parts of Vanua Balavu and other islands - in waves over a period of many, many years depending on socio-economic and political structure stability and strength.  \n\nSayes collections of stories were confined to the Tuis and matanivanua's and elders (most if not all have passed on such as Tui Laucala and brother Josefa Velodroka whose versions were captured in Loloi and Naqara). The Qaraniyaku elders were not interviewed, hence Sayes confining observations or evidence from the Native Land Commission collections, missionary Journals, etc.  \n\n'''Dating of Occupation.''' Shelly Sayes (Australian National University) in 1979 suggests that archaeological evidence from information by Frost  (''E.L. Frost, 'Fiji' in J.D. Jennings (ed), The prehistory of Polynesia (Canberra 1979), 61-68'') points to the theory that Laucala may have been settled from as early as 16 BC to 6 BC based on archaeological evidence associated with makers of  ''La pita''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.usp.ac.fj/news/story.php?id=80|title=Lapita - USP study Findings|last=Lapita - pottery in Naitabale Motoriki, Lomaiviti|first=Mana - the true face of Lapita|date=usp.ac.fj/news/story.php?id=80|website=usp.ac.fj/news/story.php?id=80|url-status=communications@usp.ac.fj|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> pottery \" ''which shows a continuous distribution from Melanesia to Western Polynesia--from as early as the sixteenth century BC to sixth century BC. Current linguistic theory argues that these people spoke an early Polynesian language. As La pita pottery has been found on southern Viti Levu as well as Vanua Levu, Laucala, and the Lau islands including Lakeba, it may be argued that, if there are not the settlers of the migration traditions, '''most areas had known settlement prior to the movement eastward'''''.\"   \n\nSome body of work by historians and researchers are flawed and challengable because studies fail to consider key fibres of sociology and common existence to link for instance La-Pita 'pottery' influence to socio-political and economic growth.   \n\nSubsistence-based tribal settlers may have systematically flowed-on to new islands as population exploded. Major influencing factors were economic growth/development and stable socio-political structures of the ''matanitu - vanua -'' a collective of  ''yavusa,'' ''mataqali'' and ''tokatokas''. This may have taken more than a hundred years (possibly 150-450 years) for a hegemony to evolve considering that average motality age was 60 years - two generations, father and son would see a part each  (beginging and end) of the century. . Also before European contact and reporting, the Fijians existed in small collective tribes and not confederacies of today (which are Colonial British influence). We should note that tribal groups movement or travelling through a body of land or even ocean in the past would have been a gargantuan feat. The primitive nature of engineering and developing tools, felling trees, and building canoes such as huge outriggers ( ''Drua'') to travel the immense body of Fiji waters, would have take even a collective group of small  tribes generations to achieve; let alone culturally establishing itself politically into a '''''matanitu vanua''''' unit with different '''''yavusas''''' with distinct capability roles (such as - engineers [ '''''mata-i-sa''u''' ], farmers/cultivators [dautei], combat/protection elements or warriors ''[ '''bati leka and balavu''' ]'', health [ '''''dau/liga ni wa''i''' ], fisherman/maritime [ '''''gone-dau/dausoko''' ]'' and Logistics ''[ '''dau-ni-veiqaravi''' ]''. Fusing maritime navigational skills with canoe engineering infrastructures would have made a formidable combination but taken years and years to grow and master the skills develop and integrate capabilities to form a culture of maritime engineering industry. A major maritime operations based on fleet voyages into the sunrise and occupy islands would have taken years to plan. Hence the stories of '''''Naulumatua, Mai Vunibua''''' (son of '''''Ro-ko- Moutu''''') voyages throughout Vanua Levu and '''''Waqanawanawa''''' (son of '''''Daunisai''''') would have been made possible from a hegemony based on Viti Levu developed over many many years..  \n\n'''Movement Eastward''' - Laucala history has been closely associated with that of  ''Vuna'' ( traditional rivals) and ''Wainikeli's'' common 'theme in ''Waqanawanawa'' voyages\"; has been told in versions of folklore (from Vuna, Wainikeli, Laucala and Lakeba) with minor differences- that Waqanawanawa originated from Vuna, a centre of power (possibly due to the links to Moturiki's ''Ratu'') and slowly influenced Eastward to Lakeba and North to Laucala as well as Yacata.  \n\nFolklore suggests Moturiki was closely linked to  Lovoni (Roko-avono possibly Bui Savulu's nephew and Batitamata's (Laucala) kin?) and Bureta (Bui Savulu sister of Verata's Roko-Moutu, Batiki's Tui Nayavu and Kabara's Daunisai) who originated from the mainland Vitilevu (Verata and Nakauvadra). The period of these migrations and settlement  may have occurred in more than one wave over many years.  \n\n'''Pre-Deed of Cession Laucala''' [[File:Laucala- boundary before the 1948 redistribution of fisheries boundaries.jpg|alt=Qaraniyaku, Laucala Cakaudrove|thumb|District of Laucala Northern Taviuni Boundary]]\nLaucala Island was leased by John Rosa<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.geni.com/people/John-Rosa/6000000010316419817|title=John Rosa|website=geni_family_tree|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-28}}</ref> and later Frederick George  Mitchell (who later settled on Invamay [Niubavu] (name given by claimant Edwin Turpin who was a Land Agent in Levuka ) who eventually sold the lease  to another leasee ---finaly ending with a sale for six shillings to  Mitchell) and Macomber brothers.
