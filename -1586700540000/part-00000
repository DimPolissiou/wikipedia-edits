Jerrabomberra consists of three sections, The Park, The Heights, and Lakeview. The Park and the Heights are divided by Edwin Land Parkway. At the {{CensusAU|2016}}, Jerrabomberra had a population of 9,508, up from 9,420 in 2011,<ref name=Census2011Y >{{Census 2011 AUS|id=SSC11176|name=Jerrabomberra (State Suburb)|accessdate=16 March 2014|quick=on}}</ref> and 8,747 people in 2006.<ref name=Census2006Y>{{Census 2006 AUS|id=SSC17595|name=Jerrabomberra (State Suburb)|accessdate=11 October 2009|quick=on}}</ref> Jerrabomberra is derived from the local [[Aboriginal Australian|Aboriginal]] place name meaning \"Youngsters' Meeting Place\".\n\nIt is home to Darcy Burge, a notable drug user/importer who has been given a life time ban from visiting woolworths after being found guilty of smoking a bong in Woolworths Jerrabomberra.\n\n\"Jerrabomberra\", an area of what was then called the Limestone Plains, was purchased by John Palmer in 1827, and settled the following year.  John Palmer had been a purser on the \"[[HMS Sirius (1786)|Sirius]]\" in the [[First Fleet]].  The area was brought to his attention because he was a brother-in-law of Robert Campbell at \"[[Duntroon, Australian Capital Territory|Duntroon]]\", a property about nine&nbsp;miles (14&nbsp;km) to the north east. His property served as a centre for the Anglican Church until nearby Queenbeyan (then known by its original Aboriginal, non-Anglicised name Quinbean) was developed.<ref>{{cite web|title=Jerrabomberra|url=https://queanbeyanmuseum.org.au/jerrabomberra/|website=Queenbeyan Museum|publisher=Queenbeyan Museum|accessdate=24 November 2016}}</ref> The Palmer family held the property until at least the 1890s, but the property was later sub-divided into smaller farms.\n\nIn 1987, Jerrabomberra Estates Ltd, with the CEO Director Alex Brinkmeyer, whose sole vision was to create a master planned community for the region, invited  Canberra-based accountant Col Alexander and Perth Millionaire [[Kerry Stokes]], who subsequently became shareholders, to partake in this venture to develop Palmer's original land for housing. The first serviced blocks in stage one of the residential release at Jerrabomberra were released in February 1988, ranging in price from $28,000 to $39,000. The new suburb of Jerrabomberra has grown from a resident population of 8 in 1828 to over 8740 at the 2006 census. Jerrabomberra was established with the construction of the first homes in 1988, followed shortly after by the construction of the community centre hall. Jerrabomberra now boasts many community amenities such as four tennis courts, a post office, primary school, bed and breakfast, gym, a Scout group, a lake and various other facilities. Many people in Jerrabomberra work in nearby Queanbeyan but most work in the national capital, [[Canberra]].\n\nJerrabomberra has a shopping centre which contains a [[Woolworths Supermarkets|Woolworths]], [[Bakers Delight]], hairdresser, an Asian restaurant called \"The Jerra,\" and other boutique stores. On the same block of land as this shopping centre, there is a pub and a Woolworths service station that opened in late 2005. On 25 February 2006 Jerrabomberra's General Store was burnt down; no other shops were affected despite the extensive damage. On 6 June, extensive rebuilding of the roof of said store was carried out and the store had its iron sheet roof reinstalled on 20 June of that year. In late 2019, a [[KFC]], [[McDonald's|McDonalds]] and [[7-Eleven]] service station will open on the western side of Jerrabomberra.\n\nThe suburb falls within the Federal [[division of Eden-Monaro]], a seat traditionally viewed as a \"bellwether seat\" due to its propensity for being won by the party that also won the majority of seats.  However, the seat was won by [[Mike Kelly (Australian politician)|Mike Kelly]] ([[Australian Labor Party|Labor]]) in 2016 in an election narrowly won by the [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal Party]]. It is also part of the state seat of [[electoral district of Monaro|Monaro]] which is held by the National Party's [[John Barilaro]]. Jerrabomberra is also represented by an active residents association (JRA) established in  October 1990. The Jerrabomberra Residents Association Inc.<ref>[http://www.jra.asn.au Jerrabomberra Residents Association Inc.]</ref> (JRA) endeavours to represent the interests of the Jerrabomberra community at the local, state and federal level in relation to issues directly affecting the Jerrabomberra community.\n\n== Geographical Aspects ==\n\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Jerra.JPG|right|Aerial and Lake Shot of Jerrabomberra]] -->The Heights is mainly situated on the base of Jerrabomberra Mountain. This mountain divides most of Jerrabomberra from Queanbeyan on the north-east and North Terrace on the north-west.  The Park is situated on the plain to the south. This urban area runs down to Jerrabomberra Lake, an artificial lake that drains into [[Jerrabomberra Creek]] and is dominated by Cove Island, est. 1992 (an artificial island which consists of eight homes and a central common facility entailing a tennis court, swimming pool and sauna), then sprawls across Cassina Rise on the South.\n\n==Population==\nAccording to the [[2016 Australian census|2016 census]] of Population, there  9,508 people in Jerrabomberra.\n* Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people made up 1.6% of the population. \n* 81.0% of people were born in Australia.

While there is no high school within Jerrabomberra the default government school is Karabar High, in [[Karabar, New South Wales|Karabar, Queanbeyan]]. However, the majority of children of high school age go to public or private schools across the border, particularly [[Campbell High School, Canberra|Campbell High School]], [[St Edmund's College, Canberra|St Edmund's College]] (boys), and [[Merici College]] (girls).

Winter also starred in the lead role. All three were involved in the short-lived [[MTV]] sketch comedy show ''[[The Idiot Box (TV series)|The Idiot Box]]'', and ''Freaked'' retains the same brand of surrealistic and absurdist humor as seen in the show. ''Freaked'' was Alex Winter's last feature film before he shifted to cameo and television films for many years until 2013's ''[[Grand Piano (film)|Grand Piano]]''.\n\nOriginally conceived as a low-budget horror film featuring the band [[Butthole Surfers]],<ref name=\"DVD Commentary\">{{cite video|people =Stern, Tom; Winter, Alex|title=DVD Commentary for 'Freaked'|medium=DVD|date=2005|publisher=Anchor Bay}}</ref> ''Freaked'' went through a number of rewrites, eventually developing into a [[black comedy]] set within a [[sideshow]], which was picked up by [[20th Century Fox]] for a feature film. After several poor test screenings and a change in studio executives who then found the film too \"weird\", the movie was pulled from a wide distribution (except for [[Australia]] and [[Japan]]) and only played on a handful of screens in the United States.\n\n==Plot==\nSkye Daley ([[Brooke Shields]]) is interviewing beloved former child star Ricky Coogin ([[Alex Winter]]). Rather bluntly, Skye asks how Ricky so quickly went from one of America's sweethearts to a name that makes children scream in terror. Ricky, completely in silhouette, begins his story.\n\nRicky is shown accepting an endorsement contract from slimy mega-corporation E.E.S. (Everything Except Shoes) to promote \"Zygrot 24\", a toxic fertilizer, in South America. Although hesitant at first, the greedy, self-centered Coogin caves in after their sleazy CEO ([[William Sadler (actor)|William Sadler]]) offers him $5,000,000. Ricky travels immediately to the South American town of \"Santa Flan\" with his buddy Ernie ([[Michael Stoyanov]]). During their flight, the duo have a run-in with Ricky's 12-year old number one fan Stuey Gluck (Alex Zuckerman). Stuey begs Ricky not to promote Zygrot 24 only to accidentally fall out of the plane.\n\nOnce Ricky and Ernie arrive in Santa Flan, they cross paths with an angry group protesting Zygrot 24 and Ricky. In the group is [[environmentalist]] Julie ([[Megan Ward]]), who Ricky is instantly smitten with. The two con Julie into thinking they're also environmentalists (Ricky posing as a highly injured accident victim, his face covered in bandages) and she agrees to join them on a trip to another protest. However, she soon finds out their true identities and the three are stuck with each other for the rest of the drive. They decide to take a detour to see Freek Land, a local [[freak show]] only to wind up in the clutches of demented proprietor and mad scientist Elijah C. Skuggs ([[Randy Quaid]]) and his henchman, Toad ([[Jaime Cardriche]]). Utilizing his \"Testy Freeks Machine\", he merges Julie and Ernie into a single body and turns Ricky into a hideous green mutation. As Elijah has run out of Zygrot, only half of Ricky's body is mutated.\n\nRicky meets the other freaks, including Ortiz the [[Fedor Jeftichew|Dog Boy]] ([[Keanu Reeves]]), Worm ([[Derek McGrath]]) a giant arthropod, Cowboy ([[John Hawkes (actor)|John Hawkes]]) a literal anthropomorphic cow, the [[Bearded Lady]] ([[Mr. T]] in a dress) and Sockhead ([[Bobcat Goldthwait]]), who has a [[sock puppet]] for a head. Ricky has trouble adjusting to his new life as a freak, though he opens up when some of the other freaks recount how they were captured and disfigured by Elijah. During his first performance, Ricky foregoes his act (which inexplicably had him dressing like a caveman) and with some suggestions from Worm he performs a Shakespearean monologue which captivates the audience. Spotting his agent in the crowd, Ricky jumps off the stage hoping to be rescued, but flies into a murderous rage when the agent makes fun of him. Ricky tears his agent's head off and the crowd runs screaming into the night, with Elijah simply noting \"that's what I call entertainment.\"\n\nThe next day Ricky discovers to his horror that he is seeing a floating specter of Stuey. He angrily shoos Stuey's astral form away, but Cowboy states that only a pair of soulmates can have such a strong telepathic bond. After multiple failed attempts to sell the story to newspapers Stuey manages to sell Ricky's story to the [[Weekly World News]], who will print anything, but ends up being captured by a group of shady businessmen that work for E.E.S.\n\nRicky tries to escape by stealing the outfit of a milkman, only to be captured by Skuggs's gun-toting Rastafarian eyeball henchmen and brought before Elijah. Skuggs tells Ricky he plans to have him fully mutated into a blood-thirsty monster who will kill all the other freaks at the next show. On his way back to the freaks shed, he runs into the other freaks also making an escape attempt, and also dressed as milkmen. Ricky butts heads with Ortiz and the two fight until Ortiz is distracted by a squirrel and runs off, the Rasta eyeballs in pursuit. With Ortiz gone Ricky is named the new Freaks leader. Ricky and the freaks break into Skuggs's lab to create a serum that will complete Ricky's mutation and have him kill Skuggs instead of the freaks. Ricky accidentally leaves the concoction in the lab, but finds a bag of tasty macaroons which the freaks enjoy.\n\nRicky eventually finds out that Elijah's Zygrot suppliers are none other than E.E.S., who arrive at Freek Land with a shipment of Zygrot 24 and an imprisoned Stuey Gluck. As they discuss their plans to mutate the world's population into a race of E.E.S. workers and consumers, Stuey follows a telepathic tip from Ricky and manages to escape, grabbing the coffee can of mutation goo left behind by Ricky along the way.\n\nOn the night of the show, Stuey appears with the batch of Zygrot only to have an annoyed biker dump it onto him, which turns him into a grotesque seven-foot monster. Stuey kills the biker and prepares to storm the stage and save Ricky. The Rasta eyeballs attempt to kill Stuey but he kicks dust into their eyes, blinding them. Toad tries to swallow Stuey only for Julie and Ernie to throw an M80 onto Toad's tongue which he swallows and promptly explodes. In response, Elijah infects Ricky with his own Zygrot, turning him into an equally grotesque seven-foot monster. As Ricky and Stuey battle to the death onstage, Elijah notices the E.E.S. executives trying to steal his equipment. Elijah stops them by soaking them with a Zygrot bazooka, mutating and merging them all into a giant, fleshy shoe.\n\nRight before Ricky is about to destroy Stuey, Cowboy reminds him that Stuey is his soulmate. A wave of compassion comes over him, and he gives Stuey a hug. Enraged, Elijah unsuccessfully tries to fight Ricky, who bashes him in the head, breaking his spine. Skuggs tries to get Ricky not to kill him by offering him the antidote for his mutation, telling him it was a time-delayed serum baked into a batch of macaroons. Ricky comments that he skimped on the sugar and punches Skuggs, sending him flying into the vat of Zygrot 24. An FBI task force arrives to save Ricky after having learned of Stuey's article. Skuggs suddenly reemerges from the Vat, having taken the form of Skye Daley. The FBI task force guns Skuggs/Skye down.\n\nBack at the interview, it's revealed that Ricky had turned back to normal (along with most of the other freaks, except for Worm, who hates Macaroons). They are then joined by Ortiz who has finally caught the squirrel and  Stuey, still a giant super-freak. Skye comments on Elijah mutating to look like her, and Ricky realizes that Skye actually is Elijah. Skuggs lunges after Ricky with a [[machete]], only to be gunned down by the now normal Julie. As she embraces Ricky, Skye rises again, this time to be gunned down by Ernie. Ricky and Julie kiss and everyone waves farewell to the audience until the film ends on a frozen shot of Skuggs once again rising up to attack Ricky.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n*[[Alex Winter]] as Ricky Coogin\n*[[Michael Stoyanov]] as Ernie\n*[[Megan Ward]] as Julie\n*[[Randy Quaid]] as Elijah C.

Winter, Stern and Surfers frontman [[Gibby Haynes]] began work on the first draft of the script, envisioning it as an obscene, ultra-violent horror film once again featuring the Butthole Surfers, costing around $100,000.<ref name=\"DVD Commentary\"/> The idea was, as Alex Winter put it, \"''[[Beach Blanket Bingo]]'' meets ''[[The Evil Dead]]''\".<ref name=officialsite>{{cite web|url=http://trouperproductions.com/Freekland/home.htm |title=The Official Freekland Website |accessdate=2007-09-21 |author=Freekland.com |year=2005 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100924112458/http://trouperproductions.com/Freekland/home.htm |archivedate=September 24, 2010 }}</ref> The two fished the script around to various studios for years, but to no avail.\n\nFollowing the end of production on Stern and Winter's MTV sketch comedy show ''[[The Idiot Box (TV series)|The Idiot Box]]'', staff writer Tim Burns was recruited to join the two in a number of rewrites. The film was completely revisioned, dropping the aspect of the Butthole Surfers entirely and turning it into a full comedy in the vein of the ''[[Monty Python's Flying Circus|Monty Python]]'' and ''[[MAD Magazine]]''-inspired humour that was present in ''The Idiot Box''.<ref name=\"Conversation\">{{cite video|people=Burns,Tim|title=A Conversation with Tim Burns|medium=DVD|date=2005|publisher=Anchor Bay}}</ref>\n\nWinter and Stern pitched the idea to [[20th Century Fox]]. [[Joe Roth]], the head of the studio at that time, loved the idea and offered the two a twelve million dollar deal to direct it, despite the fact that neither of them had any experience directing a major Hollywood film and had never even shot on [[35mm movie film|35mm film]] before. The only condition was that the film had to be rewritten and toned down to fit a [[PG-13]] rating; therefore, most of the profanity was written out of the final draft to fit MPAA standards. Within a month of being picked up, the film began production.<ref name=\"DVD Commentary\"/>\n\nThe makeup effects requirements for the film were so substantial, and the lead time before filming was so short, the makeup effects characters for the film were designed and created by three different companies: [[Tony Gardner (designer)|Tony Gardner's]] company [[Alterian, Inc.]], Steve Johnson's XFX, Inc., and Screaming Mad George's Studio.\n\n20th Century Fox had such high expectations for the film that they released a number of products based on it, including a line of action figures, a novelization and, most notably, a comic book released by Hamilton Comics (however, since the comic was drawn before most of the casting was completed, none of its characters look anything like their real-life counterparts).<ref name=officialsite/>\n\n===Complications===\nDuring filming, Joe Roth was fired as studio head by [[Rupert Murdoch]] and replaced with [[Peter Chernin]], who didn't like the film nor the fact that twelve million dollars was being invested in it.<ref name=officialsite/> Chernin cut the film's post-production budget, thus forcing a lot of the soundtrack (including a demo song that [[Iggy Pop]] had recorded for the closing credits) and special effects to be greatly cut down or eliminated altogether.<ref name=\"DVD Commentary\"/> The film's title was changed, as well, from the poorly received \"''Hideous Mutant Freekz''\" to the supposedly more accessible \"''Freaked''\", a title neither Winter nor Stern much cared for.\n\nAfter several poor test screenings, Fox chose to pull the film from a nationwide release and cut its advertising budget, leaving no money for commercials or newspaper ads.<ref name=\"Conversation\"/> ''Freaked'' had its official premiere at the [[Toronto International Film Festival]] on September 11, 1993. Despite initial positive critical response, the film opened October 3, 1993 in the United States on only two screens, making a mere $6,957 in its first weekend.<ref name=IMDB>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0109838/business|title=IMDb Business Statistics for 'Freaked'|accessdate=2007-09-21|author=IMDb.com|year=2005|publisher=}}</ref> It quickly dropped out of theatres, making less than $30,000 and becoming a failure at the box-office, and was released on [[VHS]] on April 20, 1994.\n\n==Reception==\n''Freaked'' received a mostly mixed response from critics.

The film was also nominated for a [[Saturn Award]] for Best Make-up.\n\n==Home media==\nOn July 12, 2005, [[Anchor Bay Entertainment]] and 20th Century Fox released a special-edition two-disc DVD, featuring extra material, including deleted scenes, audio commentary, behind-the-scenes footage and two short films from Alex Winter and Tom Stern, the 15-minute film noir parody ''Squeal Of Death'' and a black-and-white skit titled ''NYU Sight & Sound Project''. This DVD has since gone out of print.\n\nOn August 6, 2013, Anchor Bay and [[Starz Inc.]] re-released the movie on DVD and Blu-ray. This new release does not include any of the bonus features from the earlier, now out of print DVD.\n\n==Soundtrack==\nA soundtrack release for ''Freaked'' was planned, but following the loss of their post-production budget, the idea never came to fruition.

Winter also starred in the lead role. All three were involved in the short-lived [[MTV]] sketch comedy show ''[[The Idiot Box (TV series)|The Idiot Box]]'', and ''Freaked'' retains the same brand of surrealistic and absurdist humor as seen in the show. ''Freaked'' was Alex Winter's last feature film before he shifted to cameo and television films for many years until 2013's ''[[Grand Piano (film)|Grand Piano]]''.\n\nOriginally conceived as a low-budget horror film featuring the band [[Butthole Surfers]],<ref name=\"DVD Commentary\">{{cite video|people =Stern, Tom; Winter, Alex|title=DVD Commentary for 'Freaked'|medium=DVD|date=2005|publisher=Anchor Bay}}</ref> ''Freaked'' went through a number of rewrites, eventually developing into a [[black comedy]] set within a [[sideshow]], which was picked up by [[20th Century Fox]] for a feature film. After several poor test screenings and a change in studio executives who then found the film too \"weird\", the movie was pulled from a wide distribution (except for [[Australia]] and [[Japan]]) and only played on a handful of screens in the United States.\n\n==Plot==\nSkye Daley ([[Brooke Shields]]) is interviewing beloved former child star Ricky Coogin ([[Alex Winter]]). Rather bluntly, Skye asks how Ricky so quickly went from one of America's sweethearts to a name that makes children scream in terror. Ricky, completely in silhouette, begins his story.\n\nRicky is shown accepting an endorsement contract from slimy mega-corporation E.E.S. (Everything Except Shoes) to promote \"Zygrot 24\", a toxic fertilizer, in South America. Although hesitant at first, the greedy, self-centered Coogin caves in after their sleazy CEO ([[William Sadler (actor)|William Sadler]]) offers him $5,000,000. Ricky travels immediately to the South American town of \"Santa Flan\" with his buddy Ernie ([[Michael Stoyanov]]). During their flight, the duo have a run-in with Ricky's 12-year old number one fan Stuey Gluck (Alex Zuckerman). Stuey begs Ricky not to promote Zygrot 24 only to accidentally fall out of the plane.\n\nOnce Ricky and Ernie arrive in Santa Flan, they cross paths with an angry group protesting Zygrot 24 and Ricky. In the group is [[environmentalist]] Julie ([[Megan Ward]]), who Ricky is instantly smitten with. The two con Julie into thinking they're also environmentalists (Ricky posing as a highly injured accident victim, his face covered in bandages) and she agrees to join them on a trip to another protest. However, she soon finds out their true identities and the three are stuck with each other for the rest of the drive. They decide to take a detour to see Freek Land, a local [[freak show]] only to wind up in the clutches of demented proprietor and mad scientist Elijah C. Skuggs ([[Randy Quaid]]) and his henchman, Toad ([[Jaime Cardriche]]). Utilizing his \"Testy Freeks Machine\", he merges Julie and Ernie into a single body and turns Ricky into a hideous green mutation. As Elijah has run out of Zygrot, only half of Ricky's body is mutated.\n\nRicky meets the other freaks, including Ortiz the [[Fedor Jeftichew|Dog Boy]] ([[Keanu Reeves]]), Worm ([[Derek McGrath]]) a giant arthropod, Cowboy ([[John Hawkes (actor)|John Hawkes]]) a literal anthropomorphic cow, the [[Bearded Lady]] ([[Mr. T]] in a dress) and Sockhead ([[Bobcat Goldthwait]]), who has a [[sock puppet]] for a head. Ricky has trouble adjusting to his new life as a freak, though he opens up when some of the other freaks recount how they were captured and disfigured by Elijah. During his first performance, Ricky foregoes his act (which inexplicably had him dressing like a caveman) and with some suggestions from Worm he performs a Shakespearean monologue which captivates the audience. Spotting his agent in the crowd, Ricky jumps off the stage hoping to be rescued, but flies into a murderous rage when the agent makes fun of him. Ricky tears his agent's head off and the crowd runs screaming into the night, with Elijah simply noting \"that's what I call entertainment.\"\n\nThe next day Ricky discovers to his horror that he is seeing a floating specter of Stuey. He angrily shoos Stuey's astral form away, but Cowboy states that only a pair of soulmates can have such a strong telepathic bond. After multiple failed attempts to sell the story to newspapers Stuey manages to sell Ricky's story to the [[Weekly World News]], who will print anything, but ends up being captured by a group of shady businessmen that work for E.E.S.\n\nRicky tries to escape by stealing the outfit of a milkman, only to be captured by Skuggs's gun-toting Rastafarian eyeball henchmen and brought before Elijah. Skuggs tells Ricky he plans to have him fully mutated into a blood-thirsty monster who will kill all the other freaks at the next show. On his way back to the freaks shed, he runs into the other freaks also making an escape attempt, and also dressed as milkmen. Ricky butts heads with Ortiz and the two fight until Ortiz is distracted by a squirrel and runs off, the Rasta eyeballs in pursuit. With Ortiz gone Ricky is named the new Freaks leader. Ricky and the freaks break into Skuggs's lab to create a serum that will complete Ricky's mutation and have him kill Skuggs instead of the freaks. Ricky accidentally leaves the concoction in the lab, but finds a bag of tasty macaroons which the freaks enjoy.\n\nRicky eventually finds out that Elijah's Zygrot suppliers are none other than E.E.S., who arrive at Freek Land with a shipment of Zygrot 24 and an imprisoned Stuey Gluck. As they discuss their plans to mutate the world's population into an race of E.E.S. workers and consumers, Stuey follows a telepathic tip from Ricky and manages to escape, grabbing the coffee can of mutation goo left behind by Ricky along the way.\n\nOn the night of the show, Stuey appears with the batch of Zygrot only to have an annoyed biker dump it onto him, which turns him into a grotesque seven-foot monster. Stuey kills the biker and prepares to storm the stage and save Ricky. The Rasta eyeballs attempt to kill Stuey but he kicks dust into their eyes, blinding them. Toad tries to swallow Stuey only for Julie and Ernie to throw an M80 onto Toad's tongue which he swallows and promptly explodes. In response, Elijah infects Ricky with his own Zygrot, turning him into an equally grotesque seven-foot monster. As Ricky and Stuey battle to the death onstage, Elijah notices the E.E.S. executives trying to steal his equipment. Elijah stops them by soaking them with a Zygrot bazooka, mutating and merging them all into a giant, fleshy shoe.\n\nRight before Ricky is about to destroy Stuey, Cowboy reminds him that Stuey is his soulmate. A wave of compassion comes over him, and he gives Stuey a hug. Enraged, Elijah unsuccessfully tries to fight Ricky, who bashes him in the head, breaking his spine. Skuggs tries to get Ricky not to kill him by offering him the antidote for his mutation, telling him it was a time-delayed serum baked into a batch of macaroons. Ricky comments that he skimped on the sugar and punches Skuggs, sending him flying into the vat of Zygrot 24. An FBI task force arrives to save Ricky after having learned of Stuey's article. Skuggs suddenly reemerges from the Vat, having taken the form of Skye Daley. The FBI task force guns Skuggs/Skye down.\n\nBack at the interview, it's revealed that Ricky had turned back to normal (along with most of the other freaks, except for Worm, who hates Macaroons). They are then joined by Ortiz who has finally caught the squirrel and  Stuey, still a giant super-freak. Skye comments on Elijah mutating to look like her, and Ricky realizes that Skye actually is Elijah. Skuggs lunges after Ricky with a [[machete]], only to be gunned down by the now normal Julie. As she embraces Ricky, Skye rises again, this time to be gunned down by Ernie. Ricky and Julie kiss and everyone waves farewell to the audience until the film ends on a frozen shot of Skuggs once again rising up to attack Ricky.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n*[[Alex Winter]] as Ricky Coogin\n*[[Michael Stoyanov]] as Ernie\n*[[Megan Ward]] as Julie\n*[[Randy Quaid]] as Elijah C.

Winter, Stern and Surfers frontman [[Gibby Haynes]] began work on the first draft of the script, envisioning it as an obscene, ultra-violent horror film once again featuring the Butthole Surfers, costing around $100,000.<ref name=\"DVD Commentary\"/> The idea was, as Alex Winter put it, \"''[[Beach Blanket Bingo]]'' meets ''[[The Evil Dead]]''\".<ref name=officialsite>{{cite web|url=http://trouperproductions.com/Freekland/home.htm |title=The Official Freekland Website |accessdate=2007-09-21 |author=Freekland.com |year=2005 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100924112458/http://trouperproductions.com/Freekland/home.htm |archivedate=September 24, 2010 }}</ref> The two fished the script around to various studios for years, but to no avail.\n\nFollowing the end of production on Stern and Winter's MTV sketch comedy show ''[[The Idiot Box (TV series)|The Idiot Box]]'', staff writer Tim Burns was recruited to join the two in a number of rewrites. The film was completely revisioned, dropping the aspect of the Butthole Surfers entirely and turning it into a full comedy in the vein of the ''[[Monty Python's Flying Circus|Monty Python]]'' and ''[[MAD Magazine]]''-inspired humour that was present in ''The Idiot Box''.<ref name=\"Conversation\">{{cite video|people=Burns,Tim|title=A Conversation with Tim Burns|medium=DVD|date=2005|publisher=Anchor Bay}}</ref>\n\nWinter and Stern pitched the idea to [[20th Century Fox]]. [[Joe Roth]], the head of the studio at that time, loved the idea and offered the two a twelve million dollar deal to direct it, despite the fact that neither of them had any experience directing a major Hollywood film and had never even shot on [[35mm movie film|35mm film]] before. The only condition was that the film had to be rewritten and toned down to fit a [[PG-13]] rating; therefore, most of the profanity was written out of the final draft to fit MPAA standards. Within a month of being picked up, the film began production.<ref name=\"DVD Commentary\"/>\n\nThe makeup effects requirements for the film were so substantial, and the lead time before filming was so short, the makeup effects characters for the film were designed and created by three different companies: [[Tony Gardner (designer)|Tony Gardner's]] company [[Alterian, Inc.]], Steve Johnson's XFX, Inc., and Screaming Mad George's Studio.\n\n20th Century Fox had such high expectations for the film that they released a number of products based on it, including a line of action figures, a novelization and, most notably, a comic book released by Hamilton Comics (however, since the comic was drawn before most of the casting was completed, none of its characters look anything like their real-life counterparts).<ref name=officialsite/>\n\n===Complications===\nDuring filming, Joe Roth was fired as studio head by [[Rupert Murdoch]] and replaced with [[Peter Chernin]], who didn't like the film nor the fact that twelve million dollars was being invested in it.<ref name=officialsite/> Chernin cut the film's post-production budget, thus forcing a lot of the soundtrack (including a demo song that [[Iggy Pop]] had recorded for the closing credits) and special effects to be greatly cut down or eliminated altogether.<ref name=\"DVD Commentary\"/> The film's title was changed, as well, from the poorly received \"''Hideous Mutant Freekz''\" to the supposedly more accessible \"''Freaked''\", a title neither Winter nor Stern much cared for.\n\nAfter several poor test screenings, Fox chose to pull the film from a nationwide release and cut its advertising budget, leaving no money for commercials or newspaper ads.<ref name=\"Conversation\"/> ''Freaked'' had its official premiere at the [[Toronto International Film Festival]] on September 11, 1993. Despite initial positive critical response, the film opened October 3, 1993 in the United States on only two screens, making a mere $6,957 in its first weekend.<ref name=IMDB>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0109838/business|title=IMDb Business Statistics for 'Freaked'|accessdate=2007-09-21|author=IMDb.com|year=2005|publisher=}}</ref> It quickly dropped out of theatres, making less than $30,000 and becoming a failure at the box-office, and was released on [[VHS]] on April 20, 1994.\n\n==Reception==\n''Freaked'' received a mostly mixed response from critics. ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' described the film as \"having more laughs than a month of ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''\",<ref name=EW>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,308356,00.html|title=EW review of 'Freaked'|accessdate=2007-09-21|author=Burr, Ty|magazine=Entertainment Weekly|date=October 15, 1993}}</ref> ''[[The New York Times]]'' hailed it as one of the top comedies of the nineties, and [[John Kricfalusi]], the creator of ''[[The Ren & Stimpy Show]]'', called it \"the funniest movie in years\".

The film was also nominated for a [[Saturn Award]] for Best Make-up.\n\n==Home media==\nOn July 12, 2005, [[Anchor Bay Entertainment]] and 20th Century Fox released a special-edition two-disc DVD, featuring extra material, including deleted scenes, audio commentary, behind-the-scenes footage and two short films from Alex Winter and Tom Stern, the 15-minute film noir parody ''Squeal Of Death'' and a black-and-white skit titled ''NYU Sight & Sound Project''. This DVD has since gone out of print.\n\nOn August 6, 2013, Anchor Bay and [[Starz Inc.]] re-released the movie on DVD and Blu-ray. This new release does not include any of the bonus features from the earlier, now out of print DVD.\n\n==Soundtrack==\nA soundtrack release for ''Freaked'' was planned, but following the loss of their post-production budget, the idea never came to fruition.
