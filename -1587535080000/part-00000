{"title_page": "Battles involving the Maratha Empire", "text_new": "{{original research|date=May 2019}}\n\n[[File:Joppen1907India1795a.jpg|thumb|Extent of the [[Maratha Empire]], 1795]]The ''' Maratha Conquests''' were a series of conquests in the [[Indian subcontinent]] which led to the building of the [[Maratha Empire]]. These conquests were started by Chatrapati [[Shivaji]] in 1659 from the victory at the [[Battle of Pratapgad]] against Bijapur. The empire was interrupted by the Mughal conquests of south India by [[Aurangzeb|Emperor Aurangzeb]] and lost its independence as well as execution of their kings which continued until the death of [[Bahadur Shah I]] in 1712.\n\nAfterwards, the Marathas conclusively defeated and overtook major territories of the [[Mughal Empire]] in the [[Indian subcontinent]] and its vassals. It ended with the eventual fall of the Maratha Empire after the [[Anglo-Maratha Wars]].\n\n==Background==\nAfter a lifetime of warfare with Adilshah of [[Bijapur]] and Mughal emperor Aurangzeb, Shivaji founded an independent Maratha kingdom in 1674 with [[Raigad fort|Raigad]] as its capital. Shivaji died in 1680. After Shivaji, [[Sambhaji]] took up throne. He built strong army as well as navy. Mughal emperor Aurangzeb shifted his capital from [[Delhi]] to [[Aurangabad, Maharashtra|Aurangabad]] to defeat Sambhaji. The Mughals invaded, fighting an [[War of 27&nbsp;years]] from 1681 to 1707 in which the [[Marathas]] under [[Tarabai]] were victorious. Sambhaji was captured during this war and killed by Mughals. [[Chattrapati Shahu|Shahu]], a grandson of Shivaji, ruled as emperor until 1749. During his reign, Shahu appointed the first Peshwa as head of the government, under certain conditions. After the death of Shahu, the Peshwas became the ''de facto'' leaders of the Empire from 1749 to 1761, while Shivaji's successors continued as nominal rulers from their base in [[Satara (city)|Satara]]. Covering a major part of the [[Indian subcontinent|subcontinent]], the Maratha Empire kept the [[British Empire|British forces]] at bay during the 18th century, until internal relations between the Peshwas and their [[sardar]]s (army commanders) deteriorated, provoking its gradual downfall.\n\nThe Maratha Empire was at its height in the 18th century under Shahu and the Peshwa [[Baji Rao I]]. Losses at the [[Third Battle of Panipat]] in 1761 suspended further expansion of the empire in the North-west and reduced the power of the Peshwas. In 1761, after severe losses in the Panipat war, the Peshwas slowly started losing the control of the kingdom. Many military chiefs of the Maratha Empire like [[Shinde]], [[Holkar]], [[Gaikwad]], [[Parshuram Pant Pratinidhi|PantPratinidhi]], [[Bhosale]] of Nagpur, Dev (Gade) of [[Wardha]], [[Pandit]] of [[Bhor]], [[Peshwa|Patwardhan]], and [[Rani Lakshmibai|Newalkar]] started to work towards their ambition of becoming kings in their respective regions. However, under [[Madhavrao Peshwa]], Maratha authority in North India was restored, 10&nbsp;years after the battle of Panipat. After the death of Madhavrao, the empire gave way to a loose Confederacy, with political power resting in a 'pentarchy' of five mostly Maratha dynasties: the Peshwas of [[Pune]]; the [[Sindhia]]s (originally \"Shindes\") of [[Malwa]] and [[Gwalior state|Gwalior]]; the [[Holkar]]s of [[Indore]]; the [[Bhonsle]]s of [[Nagpur kingdom|Nagpur]]; and the [[Gaekwad]]s of [[Baroda]]. A rivalry between the Sindhia and Holkar dominated the confederation's affairs into the early 19th century, as did the clashes with the British and the [[British East India Company]] in the three [[Anglo-Maratha Wars]]. In the [[Third Anglo-Maratha War]], the last Peshwa, Baji Rao II, was defeated by the British in 1818 and the empire ceased to exist.\n\n{{Empty section|date=November 2019}}\n\n==Battles under Shivaji==\n=== Battle of Umberkhind ===\n{{Main|Battle of Umberkhind}}\nBattle of Umberkhind ( Marathi: \u0909\u0902\u092c\u0930\u0916\u093f\u0902\u0921\u0940\u091a\u0940 \u0932\u0922\u093e\u0908 ) took place on 3 February 1661 in the mountain range of Sahyadri near the city of Pen, Maharashtra, India.

They were joined on the way by Raghunath's forces, adding several thousand more soldiers, and more artillery. The Maratha army included forces contributed by all the partners in the federation, tens of thousands in all, commanded by Tukojirao Holkar and General Mahadji Shinde (also known as Mahadji Sindia).\nMahadji slowed down the British march and sent forces west to cut off its supply lines. When they found out about this, the British halted at Talegaon, a few hours' brisk march from Pune, but days away for the thousands of support staff with their ox-drawn carts. Now the Maratha cavalry harassed the enemy from all sides. The Marathas also utilized a scorched earth policy, burning farmland and poisoning wells.\nThe British began to withdraw from Talegaon in the middle of the night, but the Marathas attacked, forcing them to halt in the village of Wadgaon (now called Vadgaon or Vadgaon Maval), where the British force was surrounded on 12 January 1779. By the end of the next day, the British were ready to discuss surrender terms, and on 16 January signed the Treaty of Wadgaon that forced the Bombay government to relinquish all territories acquired by the Bombay office of the East India Company since 1773.<ref>Beveridge, Henry [https://archive.org/details/acomprehensiveh02bevegoog/page/n490 <!-- pg=448 --> A Comprehensive History of India], London, Blackie (1862), via Google Books, accessed 2008-01-27</ref>\n\n===Battle of Medtya, 1790===\n{{Main|Battle of Medtya}}\nThe forces of Mahadji Shinde under de Boigne routed the Marwar army.\n\n===Battle of Patan===\n{{Main|Battle of Patan}}\nThe Battle of Patan was fought on June 20, 1790 between the [[Maratha Empire]] and the [[Rajput]]s of Jaipur and their [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] allies. Many Rajput kingdoms like those of [[Jaipur]] and [[Malwa]] were threatened by the Marathas. In early 1790, hoping to completely rid the Rajputana off Maratha interference, Rajput nobility allied with Mughal general Ismail Beg. Marathas crushed the allied Rajput-Mughal army. The European armed and trained Marathas conquered the Rajput states one after the other. Marathas managed to conquer [[Ajmer]] and [[Malwa]] from Rajputs. Marathas recovered over 105 pieces of artillery from the enemy, along with 21 elephants, 1300 camels and 300 horses. Rajputs lost over 5 battalions and 3000 Rathore horsemen.\n\n===Capture of Ajmer, 1790===\nThe forces of Mahadji Shinde captured [[Ajmer]].\n\n===Capture of Shimoga===\n{{Main|Capture of Shimoga}}\nThe Capture of Shimoga, a town and fortress held by forces of the Kingdom of Mysore, occurred on 3 January 1792 after a preliminary battle with the attacking forces of the British East India Company and the Marathas not far from the town on 29 December had scattered much of its defending army. The defenders surrendered after the fort's walls were breached. The battle was part of a campaign during the Third Anglo-Mysore War by Maratha leader Purseram Bhow to recover Maratha territories taken by Hyder Ali in an earlier conflict between Mysore and the Marathas. By the end of the siege Reza Sahib a leading Mysore commander was among the captured.\n\n===Battle of Kharda===\n{{Main|Battle of Kharda}}\nThe Battle of Kharda took place in February 1795 between the Nizam of Hyderabad, Asaf Jah II and Peshwa Madhavrao II, in which Nizam was badly defeated. Governor General John Shore followed the policy of non-intervention despite that Nizam was under his protection. So this led to the loss of trust with British and rout of the Hyderabad army.  This was the last battle fought together by all Maratha warlords.\n\n===Battle of Malpura===\n{{Main|Battle of Malpura}}\n[[Daulat Rao Sindhia]] defeated [[Sawai Pratap Singh]] of Jaipur.\n\n==Second Anglo Maratha War (1803 - 1805)==\n{{Main|Second Anglo-Maratha War}}\n\n===Battle of Delhi, 1803===\n\n{{Main|Battle of Delhi, 1803}}\nThe [[Battle of Delhi, 1803|Battle of Delhi]] took place on 11 September 1803 during the Second Anglo-Maratha War, between British troops under General Lake, and [[Maratha]]s of Scindia's army under French General Louis Bourquin. The battle was fought at Patparganj, right across Yamuna River from Humayun's Tomb, also giving the battle its local name.\n\nThe Marathas occupied a strong position with the Jumna in their rear, and Lake, feigning a retreat, drew them from their lines, and then turning upon them drove them with the bayonet into the river, inflicting more losses upon them. The city of Delhi surrendered three days later. A monument was later erected at the site in [[Patparganj]], marked out by a surrounding ditch, commemorating Cornet Sanguine and British soldiers who fell during the battle.\n\n==Yashwantrao Holkar==\n{{See also|Battle of Bharatpur}}\n\nMaharaja [[Yashwantrao Holkar]] defeated the British army, led by Colonel Fawcett, at [[Battle of Kunch|Kunch]], in [[Bundelkhand]]. On 8 June 1804, the Governor General, in a letter to Lord Lake, wrote that the defeat caused a great insult to the [[United Kingdom|British]] prestige in India. On 8 July 1804, Maharaja Yashwantrao Holkar defeated the army of Colonel Manson and Leukan at [[Battle of Mukundwara|Mukundare]] and Kota. Bapuji Scindia surrendered before Maharaja Yashwantrao Holkar. From June till September 1804, he defeated the British at different battles. On 8 October 1804, Maharaja Yashwantrao Holkar attacked Delhi to free [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] Emperor [[Shah Alam II]], who was imprisoned by the British. He attacked the army of Colonel Actorloni and Berne. The battle lasted for a week, but Yashwantrao Holkar could not succeed as Lord Lake came to help Colonel Actorloni.\n\nOn 16 November 1804, Maharaja Yashwantrao Holkar reached Deeg by defeating the army of Major Frazer. After the death of Major Frazer, Manson took the charge of the British army. In [[Battle of Farrukhabad|Farrukhabad]], Lord Lake was a mute spectator, watching Yashwantrao Holkar proceeding towards Deeg; he didn't attack Maharaja Yashwantrao Holkar. Lord Lake attacked Deeg on 13 December 1804 (see- ''[[Battle of Bharatpur]]''); the army of Holkar and Jat resisted successfully and reached the Bharatpur Durg. Lord Lake attacked [[Bharatpur, India|Bharatpur]] on 3 January 1805, along with General Manson, Colonel Marey, Colonel Don, Colonel Berne, Major General Jones, General Smith, Colonel Jetland, Setan, and others. However, Maharaja Yashwantrao Holkar had to leave Bharatpur as the [[Jat]] King [[Ranjit Singh of Bharatpur]] defeated the British army on 17 April 1805.\n\nCovering a large part of the subcontinent, the Maratha Empire kept the British forces at bay during the 18th century, until dissension between the Peshwas and their [[sardar]]s (army commanders) saw a gradual downfall of the empire with the eventual defeat in the third Anglo-Maratha war the [[First Anglo-Maratha War]] ended in a stalemate with both sides signing the [[treaty of Salbai]]. This led to a period of relative peace between the two powers till the decisive second Anglo-Maratha war took place.\n\n==Third Anglo-Maratha War==\n{{Main|Third Anglo-Maratha War}}\nThe [[Third Anglo-Maratha War]] (1817\u20131818) was the final and decisive conflict between the [[British East India Company]] and the [[Maratha Empire]] in [[India]]. The war left the Company in control of most of India. It began with an invasion of Maratha territory by 110,400 British East India Company troops, the largest such British controlled force amassed in India. The troops were led by the [[Governor-General of India|Governor General]] [[Francis Rawdon-Hastings, 1st Marquess of Hastings|Hastings]] and he was supported by a force under [[Sir Thomas Hislop, 1st Baronet|General Thomas Hislop]]. It resulted in the formal end of the Maratha empire and the firm establishment of the British East India Company in almost the entire Indian subcontinent.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Maratha Empire]]\n*[[List of Maratha dynasties and states]]\n*[[Shivaji]]\n*[[Sambhaji]]\n*[[Baji Rao I]]\n*[[Mahadaji Shinde]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* \"The Anglo-Maratha Campaigns and the Contest for India : The Struggle for Control of the South Asian Military Economy\" by Randolf G.

These conquests were started by Chatrapati [[Shivaji]] in 1659 from the victory at the [[Battle of Pratapgad]] against Bijapur. The empire was interrupted by the Mughal conquests of south India by [[Aurangzeb|Emperor Aurangzeb]] and lost its independence as well as execution of their kings which continued until the death of [[Bahadur Shah I]] in 1712.\n\nAfterwards, the Marathas conclusively defeated and overtook major territories of the [[Mughal Empire]] in the [[Indian subcontinent]] and its vassals. It ended with the eventual fall of the Maratha Empire after the [[Anglo-Maratha Wars]].\n\n==Background==\nAfter a lifetime of warfare with Adilshah of [[Bijapur]] and Mughal emperor Aurangzeb, Shivaji founded an independent Maratha kingdom in 1674 with [[Raigad fort|Raigad]] as its capital. Shivaji died in 1680. After Shivaji, [[Sambhaji]] took up throne. He built strong army as well as navy. Mughal emperor Aurangzeb shifted his capital from [[Delhi]] to [[Aurangabad, Maharashtra|Aurangabad]] to defeat Sambhaji. The Mughals invaded, fighting an [[War of 27&nbsp;years]] from 1681 to 1707 in which the [[Marathas]] under [[Tarabai]] were victorious. Sambhaji was captured during this war and killed by Mughals. [[Chattrapati Shahu|Shahu]], a grandson of Shivaji, ruled as emperor until 1749. During his reign, Shahu appointed the first Peshwa as head of the government, under certain conditions. After the death of Shahu, the Peshwas became the ''de facto'' leaders of the Empire from 1749 to 1761, while Shivaji's successors continued as nominal rulers from their base in [[Satara (city)|Satara]]. Covering a major part of the [[Indian subcontinent|subcontinent]], the Maratha Empire kept the [[British Empire|British forces]] at bay during the 18th century, until internal relations between the Peshwas and their [[sardar]]s (army commanders) deteriorated, provoking its gradual downfall.\n\nThe Maratha Empire was at its height in the 18th century under Shahu and the Peshwa [[Baji Rao I]]. Losses at the [[Third Battle of Panipat]] in 1761 suspended further expansion of the empire in the North-west and reduced the power of the Peshwas. In 1761, after severe losses in the Panipat war, the Peshwas slowly started losing the control of the kingdom. Many military chiefs of the Maratha Empire like [[Shinde]], [[Holkar]], [[Gaikwad]], [[Parshuram Pant Pratinidhi|PantPratinidhi]], [[Bhosale]] of Nagpur, Dev (Gade) of [[Wardha]], [[Pandit]] of [[Bhor]], [[Peshwa|Patwardhan]], and [[Rani Lakshmibai|Newalkar]] started to work towards their ambition of becoming kings in their respective regions. However, under [[Madhavrao Peshwa]], Maratha authority in North India was restored, 10&nbsp;years after the battle of Panipat. After the death of Madhavrao, the empire gave way to a loose Confederacy, with political power resting in a 'pentarchy' of five mostly Maratha dynasties: the Peshwas of [[Pune]]; the [[Sindhia]]s (originally \"Shindes\") of [[Malwa]] and [[Gwalior state|Gwalior]]; the [[Holkar]]s of [[Indore]]; the [[Bhonsle]]s of [[Nagpur kingdom|Nagpur]]; and the [[Gaekwad]]s of [[Baroda]]. A rivalry between the Sindhia and Holkar dominated the confederation's affairs into the early 19th century, as did the clashes with the British and the [[British East India Company]] in the three [[Anglo-Maratha Wars]]. In the [[Third Anglo-Maratha War]], the last Peshwa, Baji Rao II, was defeated by the British in 1818 and the empire ceased to exist.\n\n{{Empty section|date=November 2019}}\n\n==Battles under Shivaji==\n=== Battle of Umberkhind ===\n{{Main|Battle of Umberkhind}}\nBattle of Umberkhind ( Marathi: \u0909\u0902\u092c\u0930\u0916\u093f\u0902\u0921\u0940\u091a\u0940 \u0932\u0922\u093e\u0908 ) took place on 3 February 1661 in the mountain range of Sahyadri near the city of Pen, Maharashtra, India.

They were joined on the way by Raghunath's forces, adding several thousand more soldiers, and more artillery. The Maratha army included forces contributed by all the partners in the federation, tens of thousands in all, commanded by Tukojirao Holkar and General Mahadji Shinde (also known as Mahadji Sindia).\nMahadji slowed down the British march and sent forces west to cut off its supply lines. When they found out about this, the British halted at Talegaon, a few hours' brisk march from Pune, but days away for the thousands of support staff with their ox-drawn carts. Now the Maratha cavalry harassed the enemy from all sides. The Marathas also utilized a scorched earth policy, burning farmland and poisoning wells.\nThe British began to withdraw from Talegaon in the middle of the night, but the Marathas attacked, forcing them to halt in the village of Wadgaon (now called Vadgaon or Vadgaon Maval), where the British force was surrounded on 12 January 1779. By the end of the next day, the British were ready to discuss surrender terms, and on 16 January signed the Treaty of Wadgaon that forced the Bombay government to relinquish all territories acquired by the Bombay office of the East India Company since 1773.<ref>Beveridge, Henry [https://archive.org/details/acomprehensiveh02bevegoog/page/n490 <!-- pg=448 --> A Comprehensive History of India], London, Blackie (1862), via Google Books, accessed 2008-01-27</ref>\n\n===Battle of Medtya, 1790===\n{{Main|Battle of Medtya}}\nThe forces of Mahadji Shinde under de Boigne routed the Marwar army.\n\n===Battle of Patan===\n{{Main|Battle of Patan}}\nThe Battle of Patan was fought on June 20, 1790 between the [[Maratha Empire]] and the [[Rajput]]s of Jaipur and their [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] allies. Many Rajput kingdoms like those of [[Jaipur]] and [[Malwa]] were threatened by the Marathas. In early 1790, hoping to completely rid the Rajputana off Maratha interference, Rajput nobility allied with Mughal general Ismail Beg. Marathas crushed the allied Rajput-Mughal army. The European armed and trained Marathas conquered the Rajput states one after the other. Marathas managed to conquer [[Ajmer]] and [[Malwa]] from Rajputs. Marathas recovered over 105 pieces of artillery from the enemy, along with 21 elephants, 1300 camels and 300 horses.

The defenders surrendered after the fort's walls were breached. The battle was part of a campaign during the Third Anglo-Mysore War by Maratha leader Purseram Bhow to recover Maratha territories taken by Hyder Ali in an earlier conflict between Mysore and the Marathas.

The battle was fought at Patparganj, right across Yamuna River from Humayun's Tomb, also giving the battle its local name.\n\nThe Marathas occupied a strong position with the Jumna in their rear, and Lake, feigning a retreat, drew them from their lines, and then turning upon them drove them with the bayonet into the river, inflicting more losses upon them. The city of Delhi surrendered three days later.

On 8 July 1804, Maharaja Yashwantrao Holkar defeated the army of Colonel Manson and Leukan at [[Battle of Mukundwara|Mukundare]] and Kota. Bapuji Scindia surrendered before Maharaja Yashwantrao Holkar. From June till September 1804, he defeated the British at different battles. On 8 October 1804, Maharaja Yashwantrao Holkar attacked Delhi to free [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] Emperor [[Shah Alam II]], who was imprisoned by the British. He attacked the army of Colonel Actorloni and Berne. The battle lasted for a week, but Yashwantrao Holkar could not succeed as Lord Lake came to help Colonel Actorloni.\n\nOn 16 November 1804, Maharaja Yashwantrao Holkar reached Deeg by defeating the army of Major Frazer. After the death of Major Frazer, Manson took the charge of the British army. In [[Battle of Farrukhabad|Farrukhabad]], Lord Lake was a mute spectator, watching Yashwantrao Holkar proceeding towards Deeg; he didn't attack Maharaja Yashwantrao Holkar. Lord Lake attacked Deeg on 13 December 1804 (see- ''[[Battle of Bharatpur]]''); the army of Holkar and Jat resisted successfully and reached the Bharatpur Durg. Lord Lake attacked [[Bharatpur, India|Bharatpur]] on 3 January 1805, along with General Manson, Colonel Marey, Colonel Don, Colonel Berne, Major General Jones, General Smith, Colonel Jetland, Setan, and others. However, Maharaja Yashwantrao Holkar had to leave Bharatpur as the [[Jat]] King [[Ranjit Singh of Bharatpur]] defeated the British army on 17 April 1805.\n\nCovering a large part of the subcontinent, the Maratha Empire kept the British forces at bay during the 18th century, until dissension between the Peshwas and their [[sardar]]s (army commanders) saw a gradual downfall of the empire with the eventual defeat in the third Anglo-Maratha war the [[First Anglo-Maratha War]] ended in a stalemate with both sides signing the [[treaty of Salbai]]. This led to a period of relative peace between the two powers till the decisive second Anglo-Maratha war took place.\n\n==Third Anglo-Maratha War==\n{{Main|Third Anglo-Maratha War}}\nThe [[Third Anglo-Maratha War]] (1817\u20131818) was the final and decisive conflict between the [[British East India Company]] and the [[Maratha Empire]] in [[India]]. The war left the Company in control of most of India. It began with an invasion of Maratha territory by 110,400 British East India Company troops, the largest such British controlled force amassed in India. The troops were led by the [[Governor-General of India|Governor General]] [[Francis Rawdon-Hastings, 1st Marquess of Hastings|Hastings]] and he was supported by a force under [[Sir Thomas Hislop, 1st Baronet|General Thomas Hislop]]. It resulted in the formal end of the Maratha empire and the firm establishment of the British East India Company in almost the entire Indian subcontinent.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Maratha Empire]]\n*[[List of Maratha dynasties and states]]\n*[[Shivaji]]\n*[[Sambhaji]]\n*[[Baji Rao I]]\n*[[Mahadaji Shinde]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* \"The Anglo-Maratha Campaigns and the Contest for India : The Struggle for Control of the South Asian Military Economy\" by Randolf G.

The club competes in the [[Super League Greece|Super League]], and plays at [[Xanthi FC Arena]].\n\nThe club since in 1967. Xanthi is well set up in terms of their financial support and youth setup. Xanthi participated in the [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup / Europa League]] in [[2001-02 UEFA Cup|2001\u201302]], [[2005-06 UEFA Cup|2005\u201306]], [[2006-07 UEFA Cup|2006\u201307]] and [[2013\u201314 UEFA Europa League|2013\u201314]] seasons. In the [[2004-05 in Greek football|2004\u201305]] season, Xanthi finished fourth in the Alpha Ethinki (first division, today [[Super League Greece|Super League]]), the club's all-time best performance.\n\nXanthi's first appearance in the first division was in 1989, and the club has been taking part continuously since then.\n\n==History==\nThe club was formed in 1967 from the merger of two local clubs: [[A.P.S. Aspida Xanthi|Aspida Xanthi]], who was founded in 1922 and was the club of the most popular layers of the region. The \"blues\" in 1961 had become champions in the Northern League of [[Beta Ethniki]], losing the accession from [[Panelefsiniakos F.C.|Panelefsiniakos]] in the barrage game) and Orfeas Xanthi, who was founded in 1903 and was the bourgeoisie of the city. From 1957 to 1964, Orfeas competed in the Northern Group of the [[Beta Ethniki]] (which held in 3 groups).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://xanthifc.gr/index.php/istoriaomadas/|title=Xanthi's history|author=|date=|work=xanthifc.gr|accessdate=}}</ref> The derby of the two teams was the most characteristic, with the city divided into two in each encounter.\n\nIn June 1967, with the [[Greek military junta of 1967\u20131974|Greek military junta]] in government, the movements in [[Xanthi]] were also made to create a team that would unite the dynamics of the two clubs, while the national championships were reorganized. The strengthening of the region in sport at that time had also taken place in other parts of the country and at the same time AO Xanthi (among other clubs) participated directly in the single [[Beta Ethniki|second national category]]. Not long ago, from 1967 until 1985, the club remained in the Beta Ethniki, with all the restructuring that had suffered the class and benefited in the early years. The difficulties were great, the revenues were few, but Xanthi's stadium was always filled. The yellow and black beads of Orfeas Xanthi and the shades of Aspida Xanthi, have brought the red of AO Xanthi, which has joined and united the city for many years. Those years were different, difficult, but \"sweet\". Without the abundance of images, the imagination was rampant, transforming footballers into \"holy monsters\" of the sport. Something that apply for all teams.\n18 years stays Xanthi Football Club on the stadiums of the Beta Ethniki. In this timeframe, the club generally completed the racing season under the 10th place of the scoreboard, while only in 1969\u201370 they had reached the 7th and the 1974\u201375 season in the 9th place. When they started to show how they were preparing for the jump in the top division, the 1982\u201383 season ended 5th, the next 4th and the 1984\u201385 season which was ambitious for something bigger, they were downgraded.\n\nIn 1985\u201386, with this new administration of Mr. Kokkalas, Xanthi was reformed and returned stronger. First title in the [[Gamma Ethniki]] in 1985\u201386, followed by another three seasons in the Beta Ethniki until the big dream came true. From the 8th and 11th places of '87 and '88 respectively, in the summer of 1989 the city and the club lived unforgettable moments by conquering the title of the Beta Ethniki and at the same time the historic rise in the big lounges. In one year, Xanthi had first goal scorer Achilleas Adamopoulos with 30 goals.\n\n====Particularity====\n\nThe specificity of the city of [[Xanthi]] and the club's also is that the overwhelming majority over the years and many of the following that followed, in the club's team were also Muslim footballers in the region. Xanthi proved and demonstrates in practice also in sports that diversity can unite by sending its own message.\n\n====First years in the top division====\nThe first experiences in the [[Alpha Ethniki]] were unique, difficult and unforgettable. With enthusiasm, passion and a \"hot\" atmosphere at the stadium, the basic goal of staying in the early years was achieved with a lot of stress. Mr Kokkala's administration first brought foreign footballers, with the Brazilians [[Marcelo Veridiano]] and Sandro making the start and following others. Especially Marcelo, he has a special place in the heart of the fans, as he still continues to be the top scorer of the club. Despite the anxiety and the end result justifying the efforts, Xanthi remained until October 1991 in the Alpha Ethniki and with the same profile.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://menshouse.gr/bala/26794/6-vraziliani-pou-egrapsan-istoria-ti-fanela-tis-xanthis-pics-vids|title=Six Brazilians of Xanthi that make history|author=|date=|work=menshouse.gr|accessdate=}}</ref>\n\nIn the chairmanship of Theodoros Kokkalas, Xanthi had already managed to win two championships in the Gamma and Beta Ethniki, the rise and the renewal of the team stay for two consecutive season in the top division, the Alpha Ethniki. But the top achievement of then Xanthi's administration was to find the ideal choice for the next day of the team, the city and the wider area in the football world. Even randomly, as the original agreement was a sponsorship of [[\u0160koda Auto|Skoda]] vehicles company in Greece for which the responsible importer in Greece was the company Viamar S.A. by [[Christos Panopoulos]]. Everything was done very quickly, but not too quickly, and timing was such a legal one that allowed the clubs to have a \"sign\" sponsor in their original name.

The club competes in the [[Super League Greece|Super League]], and plays at [[Xanthi FC Arena]].\n\nThe club since in 1967. Xanthi is well set up in terms of their financial support and youth setup. Xanthi participated in the [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup / Europa League]] in [[2001-02 UEFA Cup|2001\u201302]], [[2005-06 UEFA Cup|2005\u201306]], [[2006-07 UEFA Cup|2006\u201307]] and [[2013\u201314 UEFA Europa League|2013\u201314]] seasons. In the [[2004-05 in Greek football|2004\u201305]] season, Xanthi finished fourth in the Alpha Ethinki (first division, today [[Super League Greece|Super League]]), the club's all-time best performance.\n\nXanthi's first appearance in the first division was in 1989, and the club has been taking part continuously since then.\n\n==History==\nThe club was formed in 1967 from the merger of two local clubs: [[A.P.S. Aspida Xanthi|Aspida Xanthi]], who was founded in 1922 and was the club of the most popular layers of the region. The \"blues\" in 1961 had become champions in the Northern League of [[Beta Ethniki]], losing the accession from [[Panelefsiniakos F.C.|Panelefsiniakos]] in the barrage game) and Orfeas Xanthi, who was founded in 1903 and was the bourgeoisie of the city. From 1957 to 1964, Orfeas competed in the Northern Group of the [[Beta Ethniki]] (which held in 3 groups).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://xanthifc.gr/index.php/istoriaomadas/|title=Xanthi's history|author=|date=|work=xanthifc.gr|accessdate=}}</ref> The derby of the two teams was the most characteristic, with the city divided into two in each encounter.\n\nIn June 1967, with the [[Greek military junta of 1967\u20131974|Greek military junta]] in government, the movements in [[Xanthi]] were also made to create a team that would unite the dynamics of the two clubs, while the national championships were reorganized. The strengthening of the region in sport at that time had also taken place in other parts of the country and at the same time AO Xanthi (among other clubs) participated directly in the single [[Beta Ethniki|second national category]]. Not long ago, from 1967 until 1985, the club remained in the Beta Ethniki, with all the restructuring that had suffered the class and benefited in the early years. The difficulties were great, the revenues were few, but Xanthi's stadium was always filled. The yellow and black beads of Orfeas Xanthi and the shades of Aspida Xanthi, have brought the red of AO Xanthi, which has joined and united the city for many years. Those years were different, difficult, but \"sweet\". Without the abundance of images, the imagination was rampant, transforming footballers into \"holy monsters\" of the sport. Something that apply for all teams.\n18 years stays Xanthi Football Club on the stadiums of the Beta Ethniki. In this timeframe, the club generally completed the racing season under the 10th place of the scoreboard, while only in 1969\u201370 they had reached the 7th and the 1974\u201375 season in the 9th place. When they started to show how they were preparing for the jump in the top division, the 1982\u201383 season ended 5th, the next 4th and the 1984\u201385 season which was ambitious for something bigger, they were downgraded.\n\nIn 1985\u201386, with this new administration of Mr. Kokkalas, Xanthi was reformed and returned stronger. First title in the [[Gamma Ethniki]] in 1985\u201386, followed by another three seasons in the Beta Ethniki until the big dream came true. From the 8th and 11th places of '87 and '88 respectively, in the summer of 1989 the city and the club lived unforgettable moments by conquering the title of the Beta Ethniki and at the same time the historic rise in the big lounges. In one year, Xanthi had first goal scorer Achilleas Adamopoulos with 30 goals.\n\n====Particularity====\n\nThe specificity of the city of [[Xanthi]] and the club's also is that the overwhelming majority over the years and many of the following that followed, in the club's team were also Muslim footballers in the region. Xanthi proved and demonstrates in practice also in sports that diversity can unite by sending its own message.\n\n====First years in the top division====\nThe first experiences in the [[Alpha Ethniki]] were unique, difficult and unforgettable. With enthusiasm, passion and a \"hot\" atmosphere at the stadium, the basic goal of staying in the early years was achieved with a lot of stress. Mr Kokkala's administration first brought foreign footballers, with the Brazilians [[Marcelo Veridiano]] and Sandro making the start and following others. Especially Marcelo, he has a special place in the heart of the fans, as he still continues to be the top scorer of the club. Despite the anxiety and the end result justifying the efforts, Xanthi remained until October 1991 in the Alpha Ethniki and with the same profile.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://menshouse.gr/bala/26794/6-vraziliani-pou-egrapsan-istoria-ti-fanela-tis-xanthis-pics-vids|title=Six Brazilians of Xanthi that make history|author=|date=|work=menshouse.gr|accessdate=}}</ref>\n\nIn the chairmanship of Theodoros Kokkalas, Xanthi had already managed to win two championships in the Gamma and Beta Ethniki, the rise and the renewal of the team stay for two consecutive season in the top division, the Alpha Ethniki. But the top achievement of then Xanthi's administration was to find the ideal choice for the next day of the team, the city and the wider area in the football world. Even randomly, as the original agreement was a sponsorship of [[\u0160koda Auto|Skoda]] vehicles company in Greece for which the responsible importer in Greece was the company Viamar S.A. by [[Christos Panopoulos]]. Everything was done very quickly, but not too quickly, and timing was such a legal one that allowed the clubs to have a \"sign\" sponsor in their original name. That's how Xanthi was renamed \"Skoda Xanthi\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.onsports.gr/afieromata/story/123612/otan-o-istorikos-aox-egine-skoda-xanthi|title=When Xanthi became \"Skoda Xanthi\"|author=|date=|work=onsports.gr|accessdate=}}</ref> The signatures that fell on 10 October 1991 between Kokkalas and Panopoulos at Ledra Marriott hotel in [[Athens]], really took off the shares of the club and kept alive, in time, the names of all those who had been abused for the club.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sport24.gr/Files/skoda-ksanthh-hlteks-lukoi-oi-podosfairikes-omades-me-xorhgo-sto-onoma.5333055.html|title=Football clubs with a sponsor in their names|publisher=sport24.gr|language=Greek|accessdate=}}</ref>\n\n===Panopoulos era===\n[[File:Pele200802FabioRodriguesPozzebomAgenciaBrasil.jpg|thumb|110px|[[Pel\u00e9]] officially inaugurated Xanthi's new stadium [[Xanthi FC Arena]] in 2005.]]\n\nThe modern history of Xanthi brings broadly the signature of the great shareholder of the club, [[Christos Panopoulos]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://xanthifc.gr/index.php/idioktitis/|title=Who is Christos Panopoulos|publisher=xanthifc.gr|language=Greek|accessdate=}}</ref> who is already the most long-lasting owner in Greek football, keeping the club to the same high standards that he has set since his first days at the leading peak of Xanthi, as he is called since 2016, when the cooperation with Skoda was ended and the club's name returned to its original.\n\nAlso, while several companies perceive marketing as a feature of impressions, Xanthi has been successful since Christos Panopoulos took over this business. In 1991, Xanthi giving its solutions in the economic field and at the same time becoming a rising-initially-and constant force afterwards. They were the first club that established for many years in the 1990s the award of its best Player of the Year, with a donation of a sponsor car. It was the first provincial club that in 1994 had organized an international tournament at the [[Xanthi Ground]] with the participation of [[Coventry City F.C.|Coventry City]], [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]] and [[AEK Athens F.C.|AEK Athens]]. That same year he had brought coach [[Howard Kendall]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blessedfootball.blogspot.com/2017/04/blog-post_68.html|title=Howard Kendall|publisher=blessedfootball.blogspot.com|language=Greek|accessdate=}}</ref> who a few months earlier was a coach in [[Everton F.C.|Everton]].\nIn 2005, the world's top football player, [[Pel\u00e9]], launched its sports center and its new stadium [[Xanthi FC Arena]], giving the world glamor to the event.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ant1news.gr/news/Sports/article/108692/egkainia-apo-enan-thrylo|title=Grand opening of the new stadium from a football legend|publisher=ant1news.gr|language=Greek|accessdate=12 May 2005}}</ref> At the same year, on 7 July, Xanthi announced one of the biggest transfers in its history, the Brazilian defensive midfielder [[Emerson (footballer, born 1972)|Emerson]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sport-fm.gr/article/podosfairo/18638|title=Xanthi signed Emerson|publisher=sport-fm.gr|language=Greek|accessdate=7 July 2005}}</ref>\n\nOn 1 June 2016, Xanthi has changed its name without including \"Skoda\".\n\nXanthi has been established in the consciousness of all the fancy public, ending many times higher than all the other provincial clubs. Having reached the final of the Greek Cup in 2015 and in the championship has ended in all the positions except for the relegation. In 2015, Xanthi coached by [[R\u0103zvan Lucescu]] lost the trophy from [[Olympiacos F.C.|Olympiacos]] with 3\u20131.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sport24.gr/football/ellada/GreekCup/olympiakos-ksanthh-3-1.3487288.html|title=Greek Cup Final of 2015|author=|date=|work=sport24.gr|accessdate=23 May 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Crest and colours==\n===Crest===\nIn the early years, the team's emblem consisted exclusively of [[Democritus]]. A new emblem with small changes was introduced in 1985. The emblem was retained in this form until 1991 when elements of VIAMAR SA, a new owner of the club, were added. In 1996, [[\u0160koda Auto|Skoda]]'s brand was added. A further change in the emblem took place in 2001, with the addition of the soccer ball, while in 2007 a different version of the particular emblem was presented.

At the end of the 2015\u201316 season, and more specifically from 1 June 2016, Skoda Xanthi SA returned to its roots and is now called AO Xanthi Football Club. The cooperation of the \"mother\" of the football club VIAMAR SA ended with the well-known automotive industry and therefore the association that has linked its name for 25 consecutive years with its sponsor, goes back with its own forces and of course, under the auspices of VIAMAR, the company of the major shareholder Mr. Christos Panopoulos.\nThis has led to many changes.

All participating clubs had to disengage from their [[local football championships of Greece|local football clubs associations' championships]] as a prerequisite for eligibility.\n\nIn its early years, the competition format was frequently altered each season. The competition was originally held in four groups of 14 clubs each until 1968\u201369, when the competition was reformatted to contain two groups. The following six years (1969\u201370 up to 1974\u201375), the competition was held with three Groups, whereas from 1975\u221276 up to 1982\u221283 the league was again contested in two Groups, ''North'' and ''South''. In the autumn of 1983, a single, pan-Hellenic League Table was established, a format that has been applied continuously until the 2012\u201313 season.\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Football League Greece Official Logo.png|thumb|120px|right|League logo (2010\u201319)]] -->\nWhen football in Greece became professional, the [[Hellenic Football Federation]] handed over the responsibility for the competition's organization to the Greek Professional Football Clubs Association ({{lang-el|\u0395\u03a0\u0391\u0395}}).

At the end of the season, the bottom four teams are relegated to the [[Gamma Ethniki]]. The top two teams gain automatic promotion.

highest professional football league in [[Greece]], being a feeder-league to the second tier [[Super League Greece 2|Super League 2]].\n\n==History==\n=== As the Second National Division (1962\u22122019) ===\nAs the second tier of the [[Greek football league system]], the '''Beta Ethniki''' was formally established in the fall of 1962, replacing the informal [[Greek FCA Winners' Championship]], which at the time had tried various experimental formats towards establishing a second national football Division. All participating clubs had to disengage from their [[local football championships of Greece|local football clubs associations' championships]] as a prerequisite for eligibility.\n\nIn its early years, the competition format was frequently altered each season. The competition was originally held in four groups of 14 clubs each until 1968\u201369, when the competition was reformatted to contain two groups. The following six years (1969\u201370 up to 1974\u201375), the competition was held with three Groups, whereas from 1975\u221276 up to 1982\u221283 the league was again contested in two Groups, ''North'' and ''South''. In the autumn of 1983, a single, pan-Hellenic League Table was established, a format that has been applied continuously until the 2012\u201313 season.\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Football League Greece Official Logo.png|thumb|120px|right|League logo (2010\u201319)]] -->\nWhen football in Greece became professional, the [[Hellenic Football Federation]] handed over the responsibility for the competition's organization to the Greek Professional Football Clubs Association ({{lang-el|\u0395\u03a0\u0391\u0395}}). In 2006, the Professional Football Association of the Second and Third National Divisions ({{lang-el|\u0395\u0395\u03a0 \u0392\u0384 & \u0393\u0384 \u0395\u03b8\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae\u03c2}}) was set up, which replaced the Greek Professional Football Clubs Association as the governing authority of the Second and Third National Divisions.\n\nIn August 2010, the division's governing body decided to change its own, as well as the competition's distinctive title to '''Football League'''.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.epae.org/entry.fds?entryID=1067&pageCode=05.07&tablePageID=47&pageID=46&langid=1 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2010-08-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120330092937/http://www.epae.org/entry.fds?entryID=1067&pageCode=05.07&tablePageID=47&pageID=46&langid=1 |archive-date=2012-03-30 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The competition was contested as the Second National Division until 2019, when the [[Greek football league system]] was restructured and the [[Super League Greece 2|Super League 2]] was established as the new feeder league to the [[Superleague Greece|Super League]].\n\n=== As the Third National Division (2019\u2212) ===\nAs of 2019, the Football League Greece replaced the [[Gamma Ethniki]] as the third tier of the [[Greek football league system]].\n\n==Structure of the league==\nAt present, there are fourteen clubs that compete in the Football League, playing each other in a home and away series. At the end of the season, the bottom four teams are relegated to the [[Gamma Ethniki]]. The top two teams gain automatic promotion. Unlike the [[Super League Greece|Super League]], clubs in the Football League do not get relegated if the club fails to obtain a license.

This material is now hosted commercially by [[Findmypast]] with a separate free service to members run by the Society itself on its own web site using the [[Frontis Archive Publishing System]].\n\n==Activities==\n[[File:Society of Genealogists.jpg|thumb|The current home of the Society of Genealogists in Charterhouse Buildings off Goswell Road, London]]The emphasis is on [[United Kingdom|British]], [[British Empire]] and [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] sources, but the Society has some sources for most parts of the world.\n\nThe Society's Internet suite offers free access to major genealogical websites including Ancestry and Findmypast.\n\nThe society runs a programme of lectures, visits, and courses every year, and publishes textbooks, indexes, and a quarterly journal, ''Genealogists' Magazine''. The latter is currently edited by Michael Gandy.\n\n==Prince Michael of Kent Award==\nThe society's patron is [[Prince Michael of Kent]], after whom the Society has named a prestigious award (created in 2000), granted periodically to a person or organisation which has made an outstanding contribution to genealogy.\n\n===Recipients===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 90%; text-align: left; \"\n|-\n!Year\n!Recipient\n|-\n|2000\n|[[Family Records Centre]] <ref>{{cite web|title=Diary May, 2000|author=Prince Michael of Kent|url=http://www.princemichael.org.uk/diary/months/may_2000.html|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20031119164329/http://www.princemichael.org.uk/diary/months/may_2000.html|archive-date=2003-11-19|df=}}</ref>\n|-\n|2004\n|[[ABM Publishing Ltd]] <ref>{{cite web|title=Family Tree Magazine and Practical Family History|author=ABM Publishing Ltd|url=http://www.family-tree.co.uk/abm-publishing-about.html|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080208150207/http://www.family-tree.co.uk/abm-publishing-about.html|archive-date=2008-02-08|df=}}</ref>\n|-\n|2006\n|[[Genealogical Society of Utah]] <ref>{{cite web|title=AGM minutes 2006|author=Society of Genealogists|url=http://www.sog.org.uk/governance/agm2006_minutes.pdf}}</ref>\n|-\n|2007\n|[[FreeBMD]] <ref name=BMDPR/>\n|-\n|2011\n|Alex Graham, CEO Wall to Wall <ref>{{cite web|title=Announcement|author=Society of Genealogists|url=http://www.societyofgenealogists.com/the-society-of-genealogists-prince-michael-of-kent-award-2011-is-given-to-alex-graham-ceo-of-tv-production-company-wall-to-wall/}}</ref>\n|-\n|2018\n|Cyndi Ingle, of Cyndi's List<ref>https://blog.eogn.com/2018/09/17/cyndi-ingle-honored-with-the-prestigious-prince-michael-of-kent-award</ref>\n|}\n\nYears not listed means no one was awarded.<ref name=BMDPR>{{cite web|title=Society of Genealogists makes prestige award to FreeBMD|author=Society of Genealogists|url=http://www.sog.org.uk/files/pr-20070628_award.pdf}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Official website}}\n* http://www.diary-of-a-genealogist.co.uk, 'the background, foundation and development of the Society of Genealogists and genealogy in London, 1820-2010', by [[Anthony J.

The library was also caught up in the debates between the [[Federalist Party (United States)|Federalists]], who wanted to see the [[common law]] (based on [[English law]]) received into the newly formed United States, and the [[Democratic-Republican Party (United States)|Jeffersonians]], who preferred to have a [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]]-based system similar to the [[Napoleonic Code]].  The Federalists, who were prominent in Boston and integral to the library's founding, began importing English law books for local lawyers to use.  The Supreme Judicial Court, needing a law library for their own use, permitted the library to be moved into the Court's offices in exchange for access to its many volumes.  Meanwhile, the [[Massachusetts General Court]] (the state legislature of Massachusetts) established the office of [[Reporter of Decisions]], which was the first office of its kind at the state level in the United States, and the first officially reported decision was ''[[Gold v.

It is one of the largest and most important Slavic libraries in Europe. Since its foundation in 1924, it has been systematically complementing, processing and making accessible its collection of world research Slavic (mainly historical, philological and political-science) literature and selected original production of Slavic authors. Its depositories contain more than 850,000 volumes of library documents, a collection of maps, posters, visual and artistic materials, and numerous collections of special documents.\n\nThe Slavonic Library provides library and information services concerning the political, economic and cultural life of the [[Slavs|Slavic nations]], their mutual relations and their relations to other nations in the past as well as the present. Documents can be studied in the library\u2019s public reading room, provided with free internet access, an extensive reference library and open-access shelving with a large number of volumes.\n\nThe library processes and edits specialised bibliographies and publications in its field. It organizes cultural events, professional seminars, conferences and exhibitions. Following the decision of the International Committee of Slavists, it has fulfilled the function of the centre for recording and processing materials related to the international congresses of Slavists.\n\nThe Slavonic Library is a section of the [[National Library of the Czech Republic]] but acts autonomously in professional library issues. It consists of departments for collection acquisitions, cataloguing and for services.[[File:Leto-depo.jpg|alt=|thumb|Interior of Governor Summer House in Prague - former seat of Slavonic Library]]\n\n== The History of the Slavonic Library ==\n\nThe library was founded in 1924 by the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Czechoslovakia)|Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Czechoslovak Republic]] as its Russian Library. Its establishment was related to the so-called Russian Action of the [[Government of Czech Republic|Czechoslovak government]], initiated by President [[Tom\u00e1\u0161 Garrigue Masaryk|T. G. Masaryk]]. The programme provided unprecedented aid to [[\u00e9migr\u00e9]]s from the area of the emerging [[Soviet Union]]. The foundation of the library had been initiated by the Russian literary historian, bibliographer and journalist Vladimir Nikolaevich Tukalevskii (1881\u20121936), who headed the library in the first years of its existence. Tukalevskii donated his entire private book collection imported from Russia to the library to form the basis of its future collections.\n\nIn 1927, the library began to acquire literature of other Slavic nations and changed its name to the \u2018Slavonic Library of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs\u2019. The financial generosity of the Czechoslovak government made it possible to accumulate a remarkable collection of books within a short time \u2013 by the end of the 1930s, its book collections already comprised more than 220,000 volumes.\n\nThe Slavonic Library was originally housed in the Governor\u2019s Summer Palace in [[Stromovka|the Royal Game Reserve in Prague]]-Bubene\u010d. This space was no longer sufficient for the rapidly growing collection. The Ministry of Education and National Enlightenment thus offered the library a shelter in the [[Clementinum|Klementinum]]. The Slavonic Library moved there in 1929 and has been there ever since. At the end of December 1938, the library ceased to be controlled by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. In February 1942, the library was transferred under German administration and merged with the Land and University Library. [[World War II|The Second World War]] was a very difficult time for the operation of the library, but its actual library activities were not paralysed.\n\nAfter the war, especially in the first half of the 1950s, the character of the library was significantly compromised by acquisitions of unrelated Soviet literature. In 1956, the Slavonic Library gradually began to return to its original mission. It revived its original scheme of acquisition and international cooperation, in particular in the exchange of publications. Nevertheless, it was not possible to renew the scientific activities of the Slavonic Library and re-establish the severed ties with western institutions focused on Slavic Studies until the social and political changes in [[Velvet Revolution|1989]].\n\nIn 1958, the Slavonic Library was incorporated into the [[National Library of the Czech Republic|State (now National) Library]] as its autonomous section and has remained so to this day.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Slavonic Library : a guide|last=Republic)|first=Slovansk\u00e1 knihovna (Prague, Czech|date=2002|publisher=National Library of the Czech Republic, Slavonic Library|others=Rach\u016fnkov\u00e1, Zde\u0148ka.|isbn=8070503947|edition=1st|location=Prague|pages=|oclc=52340607|url=https://archive.org/details/nightmare00csfo}}</ref>\n\n== The Book Collection ==\n\nThe book collection of the Slavonic Library comprises more than 850,000 library units (as of June 2018). On average, it is augmented by 9,000 new volumes of books and several hundred titles of periodicals every year. It is a varied collection of Slavic Studies literature, complexly mapping the historical, literary, philological and cultural topics of all Slavic nations. The core of individual national sections is formed by personal libraries acquired through donation or purchase in the first decades of the library\u2019s existence. Since the early 1930s, the acquisitions were carried out systematically according to a thematic plan of acquisition.\n\nThe Slavonic Library owns several hundred historical manuscript books and several thousand early printed books published before 1800, but most of the collection is formed by the production of the 19th\u201221st centuries. The holdings are complemented by a number of collections of special non-library documents.\n\nAlmost all catalogue records of books and periodicals are available in the electronic catalogue of the Slavonic Library. Likewise the scanned general card catalogue of the Slavonic Library, used until 1996, and the scanned card catalogue of the Russian Historical Archives Abroad from 1923\u20131945 are accessible. The inventory lists of available collections of special documents can be found in the catalogue Special Collections of the Slavonic Library.<br />Important Collections\n\nThe most valuable parts of the holdings include several thematically coherent collections.\n\nThe '''Library of [[Alexander Smirdin|A. F. Smirdin]]''' contains more than 11,000 volumes of Russian literature published between the 1700s and the middle of the 19th century. The collection was created by the bookseller, publisher and cultural benefactor Alexandr Fillippovich Smirdin (1795\u20121857) from Saint Petersburg.\n\nA unique collection related to [[Dubrovnik]], Croatia, is the collection of '''Ragusan literature''', created by the Croatian Slavist, Prof. [[Milan Re\u0161etar]] (1860\u20131942). This thematically coherent collection contains nearly 2,500 printed books and 250 manuscripts. It comprises works by Dubrovnik writers, Dubrovnik printed books since the 16th century and publications about Dubrovnik issued in the world until the 1920s.\n\nThe Russian manuscript tradition is demonstrated by the '''collection of manuscripts'''<ref>{{Cite book|title=Katalog star\u00fdch rusk\u00fdch tisk\u016f z fond\u016f Slovansk\u00e9 knihovny ti\u0161t\u011bn\u00fdch azbukou|last=Franti\u0161ka|first=Sokolov\u00e1|others=Slovansk\u00e1 knihovna (Prague, Czech Republic)|isbn=9788070504116|edition= 1. vyd\u00e1n\u00ed|location=Praha|oclc=60886119|year = 2004}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Katalog star\u00fdch rusk\u00fdch tisk\u016f z fond\u016f Slovansk\u00e9 knihovny ti\u0161t\u011bn\u00fdch azbukou|last=Franti\u0161ka|first=Sokolov\u00e1|others=Slovansk\u00e1 knihovna (Prague, Czech Republic)|isbn=9788070504116|edition= 1. vyd\u00e1n\u00ed|location=Praha|oclc=60886119|year = 2004}}</ref> '''assembled in northern Russia''' by the folklorist, expert in Old Russian literature and linguist Aleksandr Dmitrievich Grigor\u02bcev (1874\u20131945). It comprises 68 manuscripts of both sacred and secular character from the 17th\u201319th centuries written in the River Pinega basin in the Arkhangelsk Gubernia and in the southern shore of the White Sea.\n\nAfter the Second World War, the Slavonic Library was enriched by collections created by the '''Russian Historical Archives Abroad''',<ref>{{Cite book|title=Russki\u012d zagranichny\u012d istoricheski\u012d arkhiv v Prage : dokumentat\ufe20s\ufe21ii\ufe20a\ufe21 : katalog sobrani\u012d dokumentov, khrani\ufe20a\ufe21shchikhsi\ufe20a\ufe21 v prazhsko\u012d Slavi\ufe20a\ufe21nsko\u012d biblioteke i v Gosudarstvennom arkhive Rossi\u012dsko\u012d Federat\ufe20s\ufe21ii|others=Babka, Luk\u00e1\u0161, 1977-, Kop\u0159ivov\u00e1, Anastasia,, Petrusheva, L.

The archives collected archival and printed documents concerning the revolutionary movement in Russia at the turn of the 20th century, [[World War I|the First World War]] in Russia, the revolutionary events of [[1917]], [[Russian Civil War|the Civil War]], the development in the USSR and the phenomenon of the Russian anti-[[Bolsheviks|Bolshevik]] emigration. In 1945, the archives were closed and the archival collections were handed over to the USSR, while the collections of books, magazines and newspapers became part of the Slavonic Library.\n\nThe Slavonic Library is one of the central institutions that make it possible to study the phenomenon of the '''[[Human migration|political emigration]] from the territory of the Russian Empire after 1917'''. The books and periodicals issued by Russian, Ukrainian and Belorussian \u00e9migr\u00e9s all over the world mainly in 1918\u20131945 form a collection that is unique in the world. Most of these documents were gathered by the Russian Historical Archives Abroad. The books and periodicals are complemented by several collections of archival character, a collection of the works of art by Ukrainian \u00e9migr\u00e9s, and collections of invitations and posters documenting the public life in emigration. In 2007, UNESCO included the Slavonic Library\u2019s collection of periodicals issued by Russian, Ukrainian and Belorussian \u00e9migr\u00e9s in 1918\u20131945 in its Memory of the World Register.\n\n=== Collections of Special Documents ===\n\nA valuable part of the holdings is the section of special collections containing documents of non-library character. Many of them are related to the topic of '''Russian and Ukrainian emigration''' of the interwar period: these are parts of the personal estates of the Russian \u00e9migr\u00e9s Petr N. Savitskii, Antonii V. Florovskii, Alfred L. Bem and Vladimir N. Tukalevskii; the collection of the administrative documents of the Russian Historical Archives Abroad; and the collection of leaflets and invitations to cultural and social events of Russian and Ukrainian \u00e9migr\u00e9s related to the activities of diverse Ukrainian organisations functioning in interwar Czechoslovakia. Another unique collection is the set of more than a thousand hand-painted posters and leaflets made by Ukrainian \u00e9migr\u00e9s in former Czechoslovakia between 1918 and 1945.\n\nOther interesting documents include the '''correspondence''' of the [[Lusatian Serbs|Lusatian]] cultural figure Micha\u0142 H\u00f3rnik, the protoiereus Nikolai N. Ryzhkov, the Ukrainian poet [[Lesya Ukrainka|Lesia Ukrainka]], the documents of the Leningrad artist Vadim M. Rokhlin, and the '''archive of clippings''' of articles about [[Yugoslavia]] from Czech periodicals in 1934\u20121939. The items preserved in fragments include the correspondence of famous writers (P. I. [[Pyotr Chaadayev|Chaadaev]], [[Leo Tolstoy|L. N. Tolstoi]], [[Fyodor Dostoevsky|F. M. Dostojevskii]], A. M. Remizov and others) as well as many other documents mainly from the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century concerning Slavic culture.\n\nThe library also owns several extensive collections of visual materials. The '''collection of art works''' made by [[Ukrainian People's Republic|Ukrainian]] artists \u2013 \u00e9migr\u00e9s, most of whom studied or worked at the Ukrainian Studio of Fine Arts in Prague, contains more than 500 documents. It mainly comprises works by 43 artists, many of whom (for example [[Vasyl Kasiyan|Vasyl Kasiian]], Halyna Mazepa, Ivan Kulets, Nataliia Gerken-Rusova and Mykola Bytynskyi) later won international recognition. Also the origin of the collection of 161 Ukrainian '''''ex libris''''' is connected with these \u00e9migr\u00e9s. The core of the '''collection of posters''', comprising several thousand units, is formed by Russian posters from the First World War, the revolutionary year of 1917, the Civil War and the first decades of the existence of the USSR. The '''collection of photographs''' (often hand-coloured) from [[Subcarpathian Rus']], Slovakia and Moravian Slovakia made by the Czech official, translator and amateur photographer Rudolf H\u016flka (1887\u20131961) in the 1920s is of significant value for ethnography, the history of architecture and research into everyday life.\n\nThe '''collection of historical maps''' is quite varied, albeit not very big.

It is one of the largest and most important Slavic libraries in Europe. Since its foundation in 1924, it has been systematically complementing, processing and making accessible its collection of world research Slavic (mainly historical, philological and political-science) literature and selected original production of Slavic authors. Its depositories contain more than 850,000 volumes of library documents, a collection of maps, posters, visual and artistic materials, and numerous collections of special documents.\n\nThe Slavonic Library provides library and information services concerning the political, economic and cultural life of the [[Slavs|Slavic nations]], their mutual relations and their relations to other nations in the past as well as the present. Documents can be studied in the library\u2019s public reading room, provided with free internet access, an extensive reference library and open-access shelving with a large number of volumes.\n\nThe library processes and edits specialised bibliographies and publications in its field. It organizes cultural events, professional seminars, conferences and exhibitions. Following the decision of the International Committee of Slavists, it has fulfilled the function of the centre for recording and processing materials related to the international congresses of Slavists.\n\nThe Slavonic Library is a section of the [[National Library of the Czech Republic]] but acts autonomously in professional library issues. It consists of departments for collection acquisitions, cataloguing and for services.[[File:Leto-depo.jpg|alt=|thumb|Interior of Governor Summer House in Prague - former seat of Slavonic Library]]\n\n== The History of the Slavonic Library ==\n\nThe library was founded in 1924 by the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Czechoslovakia)|Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Czechoslovak Republic]] as its Russian Library. Its establishment was related to the so-called Russian Action of the [[Government of Czech Republic|Czechoslovak government]], initiated by President [[Tom\u00e1\u0161 Garrigue Masaryk|T. G. Masaryk]]. The programme provided unprecedented aid to [[\u00e9migr\u00e9]]s from the area of the emerging [[Soviet Union]]. The foundation of the library had been initiated by the Russian literary historian, bibliographer and journalist Vladimir Nikolaevich Tukalevskii (1881\u20121936), who headed the library in the first years of its existence. Tukalevskii donated his entire private book collection imported from Russia to the library to form the basis of its future collections.\n\nIn 1927, the library began to acquire literature of other Slavic nations and changed its name to the \u2018Slavonic Library of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs\u2019. The financial generosity of the Czechoslovak government made it possible to accumulate a remarkable collection of books within a short time \u2013 by the end of the 1930s, its book collections already comprised more than 220,000 volumes.\n\nThe Slavonic Library was originally housed in the Governor\u2019s Summer Palace in [[Stromovka|the Royal Game Reserve in Prague]]-Bubene\u010d. This space was no longer sufficient for the rapidly growing collection. The Ministry of Education and National Enlightenment thus offered the library a shelter in the [[Clementinum|Klementinum]]. The Slavonic Library moved there in 1929 and has been there ever since. At the end of December 1938, the library ceased to be controlled by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. In February 1942, the library was transferred under German administration and merged with the Land and University Library. [[World War II|The Second World War]] was a very difficult time for the operation of the library, but its actual library activities were not paralysed.\n\nAfter the war, especially in the first half of the 1950s, the character of the library was significantly compromised by acquisitions of unrelated Soviet literature. In 1956, the Slavonic Library gradually began to return to its original mission. It revived its original scheme of acquisition and international cooperation, in particular in the exchange of publications. Nevertheless, it was not possible to renew the scientific activities of the Slavonic Library and re-establish the severed ties with western institutions focused on Slavic Studies until the social and political changes in [[Velvet Revolution|1989]].\n\nIn 1958, the Slavonic Library was incorporated into the [[National Library of the Czech Republic|State (now National) Library]] as its autonomous section and has remained so to this day.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Slavonic Library : a guide|last=Republic)|first=Slovansk\u00e1 knihovna (Prague, Czech|date=2002|publisher=National Library of the Czech Republic, Slavonic Library|others=Rach\u016fnkov\u00e1, Zde\u0148ka.|isbn=8070503947|edition=1st|location=Prague|pages=|oclc=52340607|url=https://archive.org/details/nightmare00csfo}}</ref>\n\n== The Book Collection ==\n\nThe book collection of the Slavonic Library comprises more than 850,000 library units (as of June 2018). On average, it is augmented by 9,000 new volumes of books and several hundred titles of periodicals every year. It is a varied collection of Slavic Studies literature, complexly mapping the historical, literary, philological and cultural topics of all Slavic nations. The core of individual national sections is formed by personal libraries acquired through donation or purchase in the first decades of the library\u2019s existence. Since the early 1930s, the acquisitions were carried out systematically according to a thematic plan of acquisition.\n\nThe Slavonic Library owns several hundred historical manuscript books and several thousand early printed books published before 1800, but most of the collection is formed by the production of the 19th\u201221st centuries. The holdings are complemented by a number of collections of special non-library documents.\n\nAlmost all catalogue records of books and periodicals are available in the electronic catalogue of the Slavonic Library. Likewise the scanned general card catalogue of the Slavonic Library, used until 1996, and the scanned card catalogue of the Russian Historical Archives Abroad from 1923\u20131945 are accessible. The inventory lists of available collections of special documents can be found in the catalogue Special Collections of the Slavonic Library.<br />Important Collections\n\nThe most valuable parts of the holdings include several thematically coherent collections.\n\nThe '''Library of [[Alexander Smirdin|A. F. Smirdin]]''' contains more than 11,000 volumes of Russian literature published between the 1700s and the middle of the 19th century. The collection was created by the bookseller, publisher and cultural benefactor Alexandr Fillippovich Smirdin (1795\u20121857) from Saint Petersburg.\n\nA unique collection related to [[Dubrovnik]], Croatia, is the collection of '''Ragusan literature''', created by the Croatian Slavist, Prof. [[Milan Re\u0161etar]] (1860\u20131942). This thematically coherent collection contains nearly 2,500 printed books and 250 manuscripts. It comprises works by Dubrovnik writers, Dubrovnik printed books since the 16th century and publications about Dubrovnik issued in the world until the 1920s.\n\nThe Russian manuscript tradition is demonstrated by the '''collection of manuscripts'''<ref>{{Cite book|title=Katalog star\u00fdch rusk\u00fdch tisk\u016f z fond\u016f Slovansk\u00e9 knihovny ti\u0161t\u011bn\u00fdch azbukou|last=Franti\u0161ka|first=Sokolov\u00e1|others=Slovansk\u00e1 knihovna (Prague, Czech Republic)|isbn=9788070504116|edition= 1. vyd\u00e1n\u00ed|location=Praha|oclc=60886119|year = 2004}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Katalog star\u00fdch rusk\u00fdch tisk\u016f z fond\u016f Slovansk\u00e9 knihovny ti\u0161t\u011bn\u00fdch azbukou|last=Franti\u0161ka|first=Sokolov\u00e1|others=Slovansk\u00e1 knihovna (Prague, Czech Republic)|isbn=9788070504116|edition= 1. vyd\u00e1n\u00ed|location=Praha|oclc=60886119|year = 2004}}</ref> '''assembled in northern Russia''' by the folklorist, expert in Old Russian literature and linguist Aleksandr Dmitrievich Grigor\u02bcev (1874\u20131945). It comprises 68 manuscripts of both sacred and secular character from the 17th\u201319th centuries written in the River Pinega basin in the Arkhangelsk Gubernia and in the southern shore of the White Sea.\n\nAfter the Second World War, the Slavonic Library was enriched by collections created by the '''Russian Historical Archives Abroad''',<ref>{{Cite book|title=Russki\u012d zagranichny\u012d istoricheski\u012d arkhiv v Prage : dokumentat\ufe20s\ufe21ii\ufe20a\ufe21 : katalog sobrani\u012d dokumentov, khrani\ufe20a\ufe21shchikhsi\ufe20a\ufe21 v prazhsko\u012d Slavi\ufe20a\ufe21nsko\u012d biblioteke i v Gosudarstvennom arkhive Rossi\u012dsko\u012d Federat\ufe20s\ufe21ii|others=Babka, Luk\u00e1\u0161, 1977-, Kop\u0159ivov\u00e1, Anastasia,, Petrusheva, L.

The archives collected archival and printed documents concerning the revolutionary movement in Russia at the turn of the 20th century, [[World War I|the First World War]] in Russia, the revolutionary events of [[1917]], [[Russian Civil War|the Civil War]], the development in the USSR and the phenomenon of the Russian anti-[[Bolsheviks|Bolshevik]] emigration. In 1945, the archives were closed and the archival collections were handed over to the USSR, while the collections of books, magazines and newspapers became part of the Slavonic Library.\n\nThe Slavonic Library is one of the central institutions that make it possible to study the phenomenon of the '''[[Human migration|political emigration]] from the territory of the Russian Empire after 1917'''. The books and periodicals issued by Russian, Ukrainian and Belorussian \u00e9migr\u00e9s all over the world mainly in 1918\u20131945 form a collection that is unique in the world. Most of these documents were gathered by the Russian Historical Archives Abroad. The books and periodicals are complemented by several collections of archival character, a collection of the works of art by Ukrainian \u00e9migr\u00e9s, and collections of invitations and posters documenting the public life in emigration. In 2007, UNESCO included the Slavonic Library\u2019s collection of periodicals issued by Russian, Ukrainian and Belorussian \u00e9migr\u00e9s in 1918\u20131945 in its Memory of the World Register.\n\n=== Collections of Special Documents ===\n\nA valuable part of the holdings is the section of special collections containing documents of non-library character. Many of them are related to the topic of '''Russian and Ukrainian emigration''' of the interwar period: these are parts of the personal estates of the Russian \u00e9migr\u00e9s Petr N. Savitskii, Antonii V. Florovskii, Alfred L. Bem and Vladimir N. Tukalevskii; the collection of the administrative documents of the Russian Historical Archives Abroad; and the collection of leaflets and invitations to cultural and social events of Russian and Ukrainian \u00e9migr\u00e9s related to the activities of diverse Ukrainian organisations functioning in interwar Czechoslovakia. Another unique collection is the set of more than a thousand hand-painted posters and leaflets made by Ukrainian \u00e9migr\u00e9s in former Czechoslovakia between 1918 and 1945.\n\nOther interesting documents include the '''correspondence''' of the [[Lusatian Serbs|Lusatian]] cultural figure Micha\u0142 H\u00f3rnik, the protoiereus Nikolai N. Ryzhkov, the Ukrainian poet [[Lesya Ukrainka|Lesia Ukrainka]], the documents of the Leningrad artist Vadim M. Rokhlin, and the '''archive of clippings''' of articles about [[Yugoslavia]] from Czech periodicals in 1934\u20121939. The items preserved in fragments include the correspondence of famous writers (P. I. [[Pyotr Chaadayev|Chaadaev]], [[Leo Tolstoy|L. N. Tolstoi]], [[Fyodor Dostoevsky|F. M. Dostojevskii]], A. M. Remizov and others) as well as many other documents mainly from the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century concerning Slavic culture.\n\nThe library also owns several extensive collections of visual materials. The '''collection of art works''' made by [[Ukrainian People's Republic|Ukrainian]] artists \u2013 \u00e9migr\u00e9s, most of whom studied or worked at the Ukrainian Studio of Fine Arts in Prague, contains more than 500 documents. It mainly comprises works by 43 artists, many of whom (for example [[Vasyl Kasiyan|Vasyl Kasiian]], Halyna Mazepa, Ivan Kulets, Nataliia Gerken-Rusova and Mykola Bytynskyi) later won international recognition. Also the origin of the collection of 161 Ukrainian '''''ex libris''''' is connected with these \u00e9migr\u00e9s. The core of the '''collection of posters''', comprising several thousand units, is formed by Russian posters from the First World War, the revolutionary year of 1917, the Civil War and the first decades of the existence of the USSR. The '''collection of photographs''' (often hand-coloured) from [[Subcarpathian Rus']], Slovakia and Moravian Slovakia made by the Czech official, translator and amateur photographer Rudolf H\u016flka (1887\u20131961) in the 1920s is of significant value for ethnography, the history of architecture and research into everyday life.\n\nThe '''collection of historical maps''' is quite varied, albeit not very big. It comprises several hundred original maps (including several hand-drawn maps), representing the entire Slavic world from the end of the 16th century until the middle of the 20th century.\n<br />Digitisation and Microfilming\n\nThe Slavonic Library continuously implements specialised [[Microfilmmaking|microfilming]] and [[Digitization|digitisation]] projects focused on the preservation and better accessibility of unique and endangered parts of its collections. The access to digital documents and to the information on the existence of a microfilm copy is provided through the [https://aleph.nkp.cz/F/?func=file&file_name=find-b&local_base=slk&CON_LNG=ENG electronic catalogue of the Slavonic Library].\n\nApproximately 1,050 titles of periodicals (ca 370,000 pages) were microfilmed by 2012.

To the south, which is also co-signed with I-69, it is the Southwest Freeway (from [[Rosenberg, Texas|Rosenberg]] to Downtown Houston), which is one of the busiest sections of freeway in the [[United States]] with a vehicle count, as of 2006, over 330,000 vehicles per day just outside [[Interstate 610 (Texas)|the Loop]].<ref>{{cite map |author= [[Texas Department of Transportation]] |url=  http://www.dot.state.tx.us/apps/statewide_mapping/StatewidePlanningMap.html |title= Traffic Counts |access-date= December 12, 2007}}</ref>\n\nUS&nbsp;59 ([[overlap (road)|overlap]]ped by US 71) actually straddles the border between Texas and Arkansas north of [[Interstate 30 (Texas)|I-30]] near [[Texarkana]], with the east side of the highway on the Arkansas side and the west side of the highway on the Texas side.

The Third Loop was to be Extended on [[Interstate 49]] from its original northern end to US-71 at the Texas state line opened on May 15, 2013 and was extended to State Line Road, where it intersects US-59 and US-71 in Texas.\n\n===Oklahoma===\n{{Main|U.S. Route 59 in Oklahoma}}\n\nUS&nbsp;59 and [[U.S. Route 412]] are co-signed for {{convert|10|mi|km}} in [[Delaware County, Oklahoma|Delaware County]], [[Oklahoma]].\n\nUS&nbsp;59 is co-signed with [[U.S. Route 270]] from the Arkansas State Line to [[Heavener, Oklahoma|Heavener]] and [[U.S. Route 271]] from [[Poteau, Oklahoma|Poteau]] to west of [[Spiro, Oklahoma|Spiro]]. It is also co-signed with [[U.S. Route 64]] in [[Sallisaw, Oklahoma|Sallisaw]].\n\n===Kansas===\n{{Main|U.S. Route 59 in Kansas}}\n[[File:U.S. 59 divided freeway in Kansas.jpeg|thumb|upright|The newly upgraded U.S. Route&nbsp;59 freeway between [[Ottawa, Kansas]] and [[Lawrence, Kansas]]]]\n\nU.S.&nbsp;59 enters the state just south of [[Chetopa, Kansas|Chetopa]] and runs nearly directly north across the state. U.S.&nbsp;59 runs concurrently with [[U.S. Route 169 (Kansas)|U.S. 169]] starting about {{convert|5|mi|km|spell=in}} south of [[Garnett, Kansas|Garnett]] and diverges north again immediately south of Garnett. The intersection immediately south of Garnett used to be a \"braided\" intersection with stop and yield signs.

The highway now bypasses around Ottawa, running concurrently with [[Interstate 35]] for five miles and utilizing that highway's bridges over the Marias Des Cygnes. US&nbsp;59 passes through [[Lawrence, Kansas|Lawrence]]. The street name of US&nbsp;59 in Lawrence is Iowa Street, then 6th Street as it joins [[U.S. Route 40 (Kansas)|U.S. 40]] and jogs east to cross the [[Kansas River]] near downtown. North of the [[U.S. 40 and 59 Bridges]], it splits with U.S. 40 as it joins [[U.S. Route 24 (Kansas)|U.S. 24]] briefly and jogs back west before resuming a northerly course. It continues north to [[Nortonville, Kansas|Nortonville]], then northeast to [[Atchison, Kansas|Atchison]], where it crosses the [[Missouri River]] over the [[Amelia Earhart Bridge]].\n\nU.S.&nbsp;59 has been rebuilt and rerouted just to the east between Lawrence and [[Ottawa, Kansas|Ottawa]] as a divided highway, as the former road was one of the most dangerous stretches of highway in the state. The project began in mid 2007 and was completed and opened to the public on October 17, 2012.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://www2.ljworld.com/news/2007/jun/21/end_road_silent_killer/ |title= End of the Road for 'Silent Killer' |newspaper=[[Lawrence Journal-World]] |first= Mike |last= Belt |date= June 21, 2007 |access-date= February 28, 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Missouri===\nIn [[Missouri]], US&nbsp;59 roughly follows the [[Missouri River]] in the northwest corner of the state, from its entrance at [[Winthrop, Missouri|Winthrop]].  In [[Saint Joseph, Missouri|Saint Joseph]] the highway is paired with [[Interstate 229 (Missouri)|Interstate 229]] through downtown.  US&nbsp;59 departs from I-229 as Saint Joseph Avenue, joining with [[U.S. Route 71 (Missouri)|U.S. Route 71]] at [[Interstate 29 (Missouri)|Interstate 29]].  The two highways then separate in [[Savannah, Missouri|Savannah]].  US&nbsp;59 then follows Interstate 29 very closely until turning northward at [[Craig, Missouri|Craig]].  It exits the state {{convert|10|mi|km}} north of [[Tarkio, Missouri|Tarkio]].   This section of US&nbsp;59 is immortalized in the Brewer and Shipley song \"Tarkio Road\".\n\n===Iowa===\nIn [[Iowa]], US&nbsp;59 is a main north\u2013south artery in the western part of the state.  It enters Iowa south of [[Shenandoah, Iowa|Shenandoah]] and junctions [[Interstate 80]] at [[Avoca, Iowa|Avoca]].  It passes through the county seats of [[Harlan, Iowa|Harlan]], [[Denison, Iowa|Denison]], [[Cherokee, Iowa|Cherokee]], and [[Primghar, Iowa|Primghar]].  Except for small stretches of [[Limited-access road|expressway]] near [[Avoca, Iowa|Avoca]], Denison, and [[Holstein, Iowa|Holstein]], the entire length of US&nbsp;59 in Iowa is an undivided two-lane road.  US&nbsp;59 exits the state near [[Hawkeye Point]], the highest point in the state of Iowa.\n\n===Minnesota===\nUS&nbsp;59 enters [[Minnesota]] south of [[Worthington, Minnesota|Worthington]], just {{convert|1|mi|km|spell=in}} east of [[Bigelow, Minnesota|Bigelow]].  It passes through rural western Minnesota for its entire length in the state.  Some cities along the way include [[Slayton, Minnesota|Slayton]], [[Marshall, Minnesota|Marshall]], [[Clarkfield, Minnesota|Clarkfield]], [[Montevideo, Minnesota|Montevideo]], and [[Morris, Minnesota|Morris]].  US&nbsp;59 overlaps [[Interstate 94]]/[[U.S. Highway 52]] in the [[Fergus Falls, Minnesota|Fergus Falls]] area.  North of Fergus Falls, US&nbsp;59 passes through [[Pelican Rapids, Minnesota|Pelican Rapids]], [[Detroit Lakes, Minnesota|Detroit Lakes]] and [[Thief River Falls, Minnesota|Thief River Falls]] before ending at the Canada\u2013US border north of [[Lancaster, Minnesota|Lancaster]].  US-59 runs for approximately {{convert|425|mi|km}} through Minnesota.\n\nThe Minnesota section of US&nbsp;59 is legally defined as all or part of Routes 265, 16, 17, 88, 66, 144, 3, 30, and 174 in Minnesota Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 161.115(19), (75), and (196) and 161.114(2).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/?id=161.115&year=2006|title=\u00a7161.115|year=2006|work=Minnesota Statutes|access-date=December 26, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/?id=161.114&year=2006|title=\u00a7161.114|year=2006|work=Minnesota Statutes|access-date=December 26, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:US59 OK10 welch.jpg|thumb|US&nbsp;59 and [[State Highway 10 (Oklahoma)|State Highway 10]] in [[Welch, Oklahoma]]]]\n\nIn 1934, a coalition of government officials from Missouri, Iowa, and Minnesota agreed to sign the current US&nbsp;59 as Highway 73 in an attempt to extend [[U.S. Route 73|US&nbsp;73]] north from [[Atchison, Kansas]]. However, [[AASHO]] approved the route as US&nbsp;59 instead.{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}}\n\nThe part in [[Missouri]] was defined in 1922 as '''Route&nbsp;52''' from [[Kansas]] to [[St. Joseph, Missouri|St. Joseph]], [[Missouri Route 1 (1922)|Route&nbsp;1]] from St. Joseph to [[Tarkio, Missouri|Tarkio]], and '''Route&nbsp;61''' from Tarkio to [[Iowa]]. Route&nbsp;61 became '''Route&nbsp;9''' in 1926, and Route&nbsp;52 became part of [[Missouri Route 4 (1922)|Route&nbsp;4]] in the late 1920s, before being removed in favor of US&nbsp;59 in the 1930s.\n\n===Historic termini===\nBefore the 1960s, US&nbsp;59 headed northwest to [[U.S. Route 75|US&nbsp;75]], crossed the [[Red River of the North]] at [[St. Vincent, Minnesota|St. Vincent]] and terminated at [[U.S. Route 81|US&nbsp;81]] in [[Pembina, North Dakota]]. A new highway and border crossing was built north of Lancaster on the present alignment. The former segment of US&nbsp;59 between Lancaster and US&nbsp;75 became CR&nbsp;6, and the extremely short segment between US&nbsp;75 and US&nbsp;81 became [[Minnesota State Highway 171|MN&nbsp;171]] and [[North Dakota Highway 59|ND&nbsp;59]]. ND&nbsp;59 still exists in Pembina from the state line to [[Interstate 29|I-29]].\n\nFrom 1934 to 1935, the US&nbsp;59 designation referred to a {{convert|50|mi|km|adj=on}}-long route across southeastern [[Minnesota]], from [[Lake City, Minnesota]], to the [[Iowa]] state line just short of [[Chester, Iowa]]. That entire route is now part of [[U.S. Route 63|US&nbsp;63]], and nowhere close to the present US&nbsp;59, established in 1935.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\nIn 1933, much of the present US&nbsp;59 and the entirety of US&nbsp;96 in Texas were originally proposed to be part of US&nbsp;71.  Under this plan, discussed at a meeting of the United States Good Roads Association in [[Beaumont, Texas|Beaumont]], US&nbsp;71 was to be diverted out of Louisiana altogether and instead re-routed from the [[Texarkana]] area southward through East Texas.<ref name=\"US 71 Proposal\">{{cite news |title=Road Route Change Attempt Protested |newspaper=The Times-Picayune |location=New Orleans |date=October 13, 1933 |page=27}}</ref>\n\n==Future==\nA large portion of US&nbsp;59 is proposed to become part of the future extension of [[Interstate 69 in Texas|Interstate 69]] through Texas, allowing the current alignment and right-of-way to be upgraded without the need for extensive right-of-way purchases or eminent domain acquisitions.<ref>[http://www.i69info.com/editorial-terrain.html I69Info.com: \"New\" and \"Old\" Terrain<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\n==Major intersections==\n;Texas\n: [[World Trade International Bridge]] at the [[Mexico\u2013United States border|Mexico\u2013US border]]\n: {{jct|country=USA|I|69W}} in [[Laredo, Texas|Laredo]].

The highway now bypasses around Ottawa, running concurrently with [[Interstate 35]] for five miles and utilizing that highway's bridges over the Marias Des Cygnes. US&nbsp;59 passes through [[Lawrence, Kansas|Lawrence]]. The street name of US&nbsp;59 in Lawrence is Iowa Street, then 6th Street as it joins [[U.S. Route 40 (Kansas)|U.S. 40]] and jogs east to cross the [[Kansas River]] near downtown. North of the [[U.S. 40 and 59 Bridges]], it splits with U.S. 40 as it joins [[U.S. Route 24 (Kansas)|U.S. 24]] briefly and jogs back west before resuming a northerly course.

US&nbsp;59 departs from I-229 as Saint Joseph Avenue, joining with [[U.S. Route 71 (Missouri)|U.S. Route 71]] at [[Interstate 29 (Missouri)|Interstate 29]].  The two highways then separate in [[Savannah, Missouri|Savannah]].  US&nbsp;59 then follows Interstate 29 very closely until turning northward at [[Craig, Missouri|Craig]].  It exits the state {{convert|10|mi|km}} north of [[Tarkio, Missouri|Tarkio]].   This section of US&nbsp;59 is immortalized in the Brewer and Shipley song \"Tarkio Road\".\n\n===Iowa===\nIn [[Iowa]], US&nbsp;59 is a main north\u2013south artery in the western part of the state.  It enters Iowa south of [[Shenandoah, Iowa|Shenandoah]] and junctions [[Interstate 80]] at [[Avoca, Iowa|Avoca]].  It passes through the county seats of [[Harlan, Iowa|Harlan]], [[Denison, Iowa|Denison]], [[Cherokee, Iowa|Cherokee]], and [[Primghar, Iowa|Primghar]].  Except for small stretches of [[Limited-access road|expressway]] near [[Avoca, Iowa|Avoca]], Denison, and [[Holstein, Iowa|Holstein]], the entire length of US&nbsp;59 in Iowa is an undivided two-lane road.  US&nbsp;59 exits the state near [[Hawkeye Point]], the highest point in the state of Iowa.\n\n===Minnesota===\nUS&nbsp;59 enters [[Minnesota]] south of [[Worthington, Minnesota|Worthington]], just {{convert|1|mi|km|spell=in}} east of [[Bigelow, Minnesota|Bigelow]].  It passes through rural western Minnesota for its entire length in the state.  Some cities along the way include [[Slayton, Minnesota|Slayton]], [[Marshall, Minnesota|Marshall]], [[Clarkfield, Minnesota|Clarkfield]], [[Montevideo, Minnesota|Montevideo]], and [[Morris, Minnesota|Morris]].  US&nbsp;59 overlaps [[Interstate 94]]/[[U.S. Highway 52]] in the [[Fergus Falls, Minnesota|Fergus Falls]] area.  North of Fergus Falls, US&nbsp;59 passes through [[Pelican Rapids, Minnesota|Pelican Rapids]], [[Detroit Lakes, Minnesota|Detroit Lakes]] and [[Thief River Falls, Minnesota|Thief River Falls]] before ending at the Canada\u2013US border north of [[Lancaster, Minnesota|Lancaster]].  US-59 runs for approximately {{convert|425|mi|km}} through Minnesota.\n\nThe Minnesota section of US&nbsp;59 is legally defined as all or part of Routes 265, 16, 17, 88, 66, 144, 3, 30, and 174 in Minnesota Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 161.115(19), (75), and (196) and 161.114(2).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/?id=161.115&year=2006|title=\u00a7161.115|year=2006|work=Minnesota Statutes|access-date=December 26, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/?id=161.114&year=2006|title=\u00a7161.114|year=2006|work=Minnesota Statutes|access-date=December 26, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:US59 OK10 welch.jpg|thumb|US&nbsp;59 and [[State Highway 10 (Oklahoma)|State Highway 10]] in [[Welch, Oklahoma]]]]\n\nIn 1934, a coalition of government officials from Missouri, Iowa, and Minnesota agreed to sign the current US&nbsp;59 as Highway 73 in an attempt to extend [[U.S. Route 73|US&nbsp;73]] north from [[Atchison, Kansas]]. However, [[AASHO]] approved the route as US&nbsp;59 instead.{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}}\n\nThe part in [[Missouri]] was defined in 1922 as '''Route&nbsp;52''' from [[Kansas]] to [[St. Joseph, Missouri|St. Joseph]], [[Missouri Route 1 (1922)|Route&nbsp;1]] from St. Joseph to [[Tarkio, Missouri|Tarkio]], and '''Route&nbsp;61''' from Tarkio to [[Iowa]]. Route&nbsp;61 became '''Route&nbsp;9''' in 1926, and Route&nbsp;52 became part of [[Missouri Route 4 (1922)|Route&nbsp;4]] in the late 1920s, before being removed in favor of US&nbsp;59 in the 1930s.\n\n===Historic termini===\nBefore the 1960s, US&nbsp;59 headed northwest to [[U.S. Route 75|US&nbsp;75]], crossed the [[Red River of the North]] at [[St. Vincent, Minnesota|St. Vincent]] and terminated at [[U.S. Route 81|US&nbsp;81]] in [[Pembina, North Dakota]]. A new highway and border crossing was built north of Lancaster on the present alignment. The former segment of US&nbsp;59 between Lancaster and US&nbsp;75 became CR&nbsp;6, and the extremely short segment between US&nbsp;75 and US&nbsp;81 became [[Minnesota State Highway 171|MN&nbsp;171]] and [[North Dakota Highway 59|ND&nbsp;59]]. ND&nbsp;59 still exists in Pembina from the state line to [[Interstate 29|I-29]].\n\nFrom 1934 to 1935, the US&nbsp;59 designation referred to a {{convert|50|mi|km|adj=on}}-long route across southeastern [[Minnesota]], from [[Lake City, Minnesota]], to the [[Iowa]] state line just short of [[Chester, Iowa]]. That entire route is now part of [[U.S. Route 63|US&nbsp;63]], and nowhere close to the present US&nbsp;59, established in 1935.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\nIn 1933, much of the present US&nbsp;59 and the entirety of US&nbsp;96 in Texas were originally proposed to be part of US&nbsp;71.
