The Byzantines plundered and burned the Bulgar capital [[Pliska]] which gave time for the Bulgarians to block passes in the [[Balkan Mountains]] that served as exits out of Bulgaria. The final battle took place on 26 July 811, in some of the passes in the eastern part of the [[Balkans]], most probably the [[Varbitsa Pass|V\u0103rbitsa Pass]]. There, the Bulgarians used the tactics of [[ambush]] and [[surprise attack|surprise]] [[night combat|night attacks]] to effectively trap and immobilize the [[Byzantine army]], thus annihilating almost the whole army, including the Emperor. After the battle, Krum encased Nicephorus's skull in silver, and used it as a cup for wine-drinking. This is one of the best documented instances of the custom of the [[skull cup]].\n\nThe Battle of Pliska was one of the worst defeats in [[Byzantine history]]. It deterred Byzantine rulers from sending their troops north of the Balkans for more than 150 years afterwards, which increased the influence and spread of the Bulgarians to the west and south of the Balkan Peninsula, resulting in a great territorial enlargement of the [[First Bulgarian Empire]].\n\n== Initial campaigns ==\n[[File:Nicephorus I Logothetes.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[Nicephorus I]].]]\nWhen [[Nicephorus I]] became [[Byzantine emperor|emperor]] in 802, he planned to reincorporate Bulgar-held territory back into the empire. In 807 he launched a campaign but only reached [[Odrin]] and achieved nothing because of a conspiracy in his capital.<ref>Theophanes Confessor. ''Chronographia'', p. 482\u201384</ref> That attempted attack, however, gave reason for the Bulgar Khan [[Krum]] to undertake military operations against the Byzantine Empire. The main objective was an extension to the south and south-west. In the next year a Bulgar army penetrated the [[Struma (river)|Struma]] Valley and defeated the Byzantines. The Bulgar troops captured 1,100 ''litres'' (roughly 332 to 348 kilograms)<ref>http://www.greece.org/Byzantium/konstantinato.htm</ref> of gold and killed many enemy soldiers including all ''[[strategos|strategoi]]'' and most of the commanders.<ref>Theophanes Confessor. ''Chronographia'', pp. 484\u201386</ref> In 809 the Khan personally besieged the strong fortress of [[Serdica]] and [[siege of Serdica (809)|seized the city]], killing the whole garrison of 6,000.<ref>Theophanes Confessor. Chronographia, p. 485</ref>\n\n== Preparation for an invasion ==\nIn 811, the Byzantine Emperor organised a large campaign to conquer Bulgaria once and for all. He gathered an enormous army from the Anatolian and European ''[[Theme (Byzantine district)|themata]]'', and the imperial bodyguard (the ''[[tagma (military)|tagmata]]''); they were joined by a number of irregular troops who expected a swift victory and plunder. The conquest was supposed to be easy, and most of the high-ranking officials and aristocrats accompanied him, including his son [[Stauracius]] and his brother-in-law [[Michael I Rangabe]].<ref>Anonymus Vaticanus, p.148</ref> The whole army consisted of around 60,000 to 80,000 soldiers.<ref name=\"Hupchick, p. 80\">Hupchick, p. 80</ref>\n\n== Sack of Pliska ==\nThe army gathered in May, and by 10 July had set up camp at the fortress of Marcelae (present-day [[Karnobat]]) near the Bulgarian frontier. Nicephorus intended to confuse them and over the next ten days launched several supposed attacks, which were immediately called back. Krum assessed the situation and estimated that he could not repulse the enemy and offered peace, which Nicephorus haughtily rejected. Theophanes wrote that the Emperor, \"was deterred from his own ill thoughts and the suggestions of his advisors who were thinking like him\".<ref>Theophanes Confessor. Chronographia, p.486</ref> Some of his military chiefs considered the invasion of Bulgaria to be imprudent and too risky, but Nicephorus was convinced of his ultimate success.\n\nIn June he invaded the Bulgarian lands and marched through the Balkan passes towards the capital of [[Pliska]]. On 20 July Nicephorus divided the army into three columns, each marching by a different route towards Pliska. He met little resistance<ref>Chronique de Michel le Syrien, p.17</ref> and after three days he reached the capital where the Byzantines met an army of 12,000 elite soldiers who guarded the stronghold.<ref>Hupchick, p. 81</ref> The Bulgarians were defeated and most of them perished. Another hastily assembled army of 15,000 soldiers had a similar fate.<ref name=\"Hupchick, p. 80\">Hupchick, p. 80</ref> On 23 July the Byzantines quickly captured the defenseless capital. The city was sacked and the countryside destroyed.<ref>Ioannes Zonaras. Epistome historiatus, pp. 372\u201373</ref><ref>Georgius Monachus. Chroniconq, p. 774</ref> Khan Krum attempted once more to negotiate for peace. According to the historian Theophanes, Krum's proclamation stated, \"Here you are, you have won. So take what you please and go with peace.\" Nicephorus, overconfident from his success, ignored him. He believed that Bulgaria was thoroughly conquered.\n\n[[Michael the Syrian]], patriarch of the Syrian Jacobites in the twelfth century, described in his Chronicle the brutalities and atrocities of Nicephorus's troops: \"Nicephorus, emperor of the Romans, walked in Bulgarians land: he was victorious and killed a great number of them. He reached their capital, took it over and devastated it. His savagery went to such a point that he ordered to bring their small children, got them tied down on earth and made thresh grain stones to smash them.\" The Byzantine soldiers looted and plundered; burnt down the unharvested fields, cut the tendons of the oxen, slaughtered sheep and pigs.\"<ref>Anonymus Vaticanus, p. 150</ref> The Emperor took over Krum's treasury, locked it and did not allow his troops to reach it.<ref>Anastasius Bibliothecarius. Chronographia tripertita, p.329</ref>\n\n== Battle ==\n{{more citations needed section|date=July 2017}}<!--three paragraphs with no citations-->\nWhile Nicephorus and his army were busy plundering the Bulgarian capital, Krum mobilized his people (including women and [[Pannonian Avars|Avar]] mercenaries<ref>{{cite book |first=Geoffrey |last=Regan |title=Military Blunders |page=74}}</ref>) to set traps and ambushes in the mountain passes.<ref>Theophanes Confessor. ''Chronographia'', p.430</ref> Initially Nicephorus intended to march through [[Moesia]] and reach Serdica before returning to Constantinople but the news of these preparations for a battle changed his decision and he chose the shortest way to his capital.<ref>Anonymus Vaticanus, p.152</ref> The overconfident Emperor neglected to scout ahead. On 25 July his army entered the Varbica Pass but his cavalry told him the road was barred with thick wooden walls and Krum's detachments watched from the heights around.<ref>Theophanes Confessor.'' Chronographia'', pp. 490\u201391</ref> The Emperor became panicked by the situation and repeatedly stated to his companions \"Even if we have had wings we could not have escaped from peril.\"<ref name=\"Theophanes Confessor pp. 489\u201392\">Theophanes Confessor. ''Chronographia'', pp. 489\u201392</ref> Before they could retreat, the Bulgars blocked the valley entrance too.\n\nNicephorus, unable to face attacking one of the palisades, simply set up camp, despite his generals' misgivings. By the third night Byzantine morale was shattered, while Bulgar troops banged their shields and taunted them.\n\nOn that night the Bulgarians gathered their troops and tightened the belt around the trapped enemy. At dawn they rushed down and started to kill the panicked and totally confused Byzantines. The ''[[Tagma (military)|tagmata]]'' were the first to be attacked. The Byzantines fruitlessly resisted for a short time and perished. Upon seeing their comrades' fate, the next units immediately ran away.\n\nOn their way south the Byzantine forces hit a muddy river which was difficult to cross. As they could not find a ford quickly enough, many Byzantines fell into the river. The first stalled in the mud with their horses and were trampled by those who came next. The river was filled with so many dead that the chasing Bulgarians easily passed over them and continued the pursuit. Those who passed through the river reached the wooden wall which was high and thick. The Byzantines left their horses and began climbing the wall with hands and legs and hung over the other side. The Bulgarians had dug a deep moat from the inner side and when the Byzantine soldiers were getting across the ramparts, they fell from the high wall, breaking their limbs. Some of them died instantly, others hobbled some time before falling to the ground and dying from thirst and hunger. The Byzantine troops burned the wall at several places but as they were rushing to get across it, they too fell into the moat along with the burning parts of the palisade. Almost everyone perished; some were killed by the sword, others drowned in the river or were mortally injured after falling from the wall and some of them died in the fire. Among the nobles killed were the [[patrikios|patricians]] Theodosios Salibaras and [[Sisinnios Triphyllios]]; the ''[[strategos]]'' of the [[Anatolics]] Romanos and the ''strategos'' of [[Thrace (theme)|Thrace]]; as well as the commanders of the [[Excubitors]] and [[Vigla (tagma)|Vigla]] ''tagmata''.\n[[File:Krum1.jpg|thumb|right|Bulgarian Khan Krum the Fearsome feasts with his nobles as a servant (right) brings the skull of Nikephoros I, fashioned into a drinking cup, full of wine.]]\n\nReportedly, only a few survived the defeat. The most notable person to be killed, however, was Emperor Nicephorus, who according to historians died on a dunghill on the day of the battle.<ref>Anonymus Vaticanus, p.153</ref> Nicephorus's son, Stauracius, was carried to safety by the Imperial bodyguard after receiving a paralyzing wound to his neck.<ref name=\"Theophanes Confessor pp. 489\u201392\"/><ref>Ioannes Zonaras.

A new passenger terminal building is under construction and is expected to be finished in 2020.\n\n==History==\n{{For|information on the history of Clark Airport prior to the explosion of [[Mount Pinatubo]] in 1991 and the departure of U.S. forces from the [[Philippines]]|Clark Air Base}}\n[[File:Clark International Airport (CRK).svg|thumb|200px|right|The logo of Clark International Airport used until 2019]]\n\nThe United States Cavalry established Fort Stotsenberg in 1902 and later converted a portion of which into an air field, which was, in turn, renamed Clark Air Field in 1919\u2014in honor of aviator Major [[Harold M. Clark|Harold Melville Clark]]\u2014and was used as one of the most important overseas bases during the 2nd World War.\n\nIn 1947, the RP-US Military Bases Agreement was signed, integrating Clark Air Field and Fort Stotsenberg into Clark Air Base but, after the eruption of [[Mount Pinatubo]] in June 1991 and the non-renewal of the military bases agreement, Clark Air Base was reverted to the Philippine Government.\n\nThe Bases Conversion Development Act of 1992 accelerated the conversion of Clark Air Base into a Special Economic Zone, and in 2007, the Philippine Congress enacted a law (RA 9400) which renamed the base to Clark Freeport Philippines. It is now segregated in two separate entities:  Clark Freeport Zone administered by the Clark Development Corporation, and the Clark Civil Aviation Complex administered by the Clark International Airport Corporation.\n\nIn 1993, the former Clark Air Base was reopened as the Clark Special Economic Zone (CSEZ) after the area was cleared from [[lahar]] debris from the [[Mount Pinatubo]] explosion and a [[Pacific typhoon|typhoon]] that followed. During the administration of [[President of the Philippines|President]] [[Fidel V. Ramos]], it was designated to be the future primary international gateway of the Philippines and the major international airport of [[Metro Manila]] and its neighboring provinces when [[Ninoy Aquino International Airport]] in [[Metro Manila]] has reached full capacity and can no longer be expanded.\n\nCIAC traces its origin from Republic Act No. 7227, otherwise known as the \"Bases Conversion and Development Act of 1992\", which authorized the conversion of several military reservations, including the former Clark Air Base, into sustainable economic zones. Jurisdiction over the corporation shifted from the Bases Conversion Development Authority (BCDA) and the Clark Development Corporation (CDC) since its formal incorporation with the SEC in 1995.\n\nIn 2003, President [[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo]] renamed Clark International Airport as the Diosdado Macapagal International Airport (DMIA), in memory of her father, former President [[Diosdado Macapagal]], and ordered the Clark International Airport Corporation (CIAC) in February 2007 to fund the US$1.7 billion (PH\u20b176.5 billion) expansion of DMIA and the approval of a US$2 million (PH\u20b190 million) study plan financed by the Korean International Cooperation Agency. The first stage of Clark Airport's expansion program, a PH\u20b1130 million terminal expansion, was completed in January 2008 to accommodate more than 2 million passengers annually.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sunstar.com.ph/static/pam/2007/12/23/news/korean.firm.prepares.$2m.clark.airport.master.plan..html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080928144135/http://www.sunstar.com.ph/static/pam/2007/12/23/news/korean.firm.prepares.%242m.clark.airport.master.plan..html|url-status=dead|title=Sunstar.com|archivedate=28 September 2008}}</ref>\n\nIn 2011, CIAC was transferred from the [[Bases Conversion and Development Authority]] and became an attached agency of the [[Department of Transportation (Philippines)|Department of Transportation and Communications]] (DOTC) by virtue of Executive Order No. 64 issued by President [[Benigno Aquino III]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.officialgazette.gov.ph/2011/12/21/executive-order-no-64-s-2011/|title=Executive Order No. 64, s. 2011|newspaper=[[Official Gazette (Philippines)|Official Gazette]]|date=21 December 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe airport's name reverted to Clark International Airport in February 2012,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/business/02/28/12/clark-airport-name-change-plan-sparks-debate |title=Clark airport name-change plan sparks debate |publisher=ABS-CBN News |date=28 February 2012}}</ref> but the passenger terminal continued to bear Diosdado Macapagal's name.\n\nOn 28 February 2017, President [[Rodrigo Duterte]] issued Executive Order No. 14, reverting CIAC as a subsidiary of the BCDA, but with the Department of Transportation maintaining supervision and operational control of the airport.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.officialgazette.gov.ph/downloads/2017/02feb/20170228-EO-14-RRD.pdf|title=Executive Order No. 14, s. 2017|newspaper=[[Official Gazette (Philippines)|Official Gazette]]|accessdate=28 June 2019}}</ref>\n\nOn 22 April 2019, the airport was temporarily closed as all flights to and from Clark are canceled due to a [[2019 Luzon earthquake|magnitude 6.1 earthquake]] occurred, originating in [[Zambales]].

Clark|Harold Melville Clark]]\u2014and was used as one of the most important overseas bases during the 2nd World War.\n\nIn 1947, the RP-US Military Bases Agreement was signed, integrating Clark Air Field and Fort Stotsenberg into Clark Air Base but, after the eruption of [[Mount Pinatubo]] in June 1991 and the non-renewal of the military bases agreement, Clark Air Base was reverted to the Philippine Government.\n\nThe Bases Conversion Development Act of 1992 accelerated the conversion of Clark Air Base into a Special Economic Zone, and in 2007, the Philippine Congress enacted a law (RA 9400) which renamed the base to Clark Freeport Philippines. It is now segregated in two separate entities:  Clark Freeport Zone administered by the Clark Development Corporation, and the Clark Civil Aviation Complex administered by the Clark International Airport Corporation.\n\nIn 1993, the former Clark Air Base was reopened as the Clark Special Economic Zone (CSEZ) after the area was cleared from [[lahar]] debris from the [[Mount Pinatubo]] explosion and a [[Pacific typhoon|typhoon]] that followed. During the administration of [[President of the Philippines|President]] [[Fidel V. Ramos]], it was designated to be the future primary international gateway of the Philippines and the major international airport of [[Metro Manila]] and its neighboring provinces when [[Ninoy Aquino International Airport]] in [[Metro Manila]] has reached full capacity and can no longer be expanded.\n\nCIAC traces its origin from Republic Act No. 7227, otherwise known as the \"Bases Conversion and Development Act of 1992\", which authorized the conversion of several military reservations, including the former Clark Air Base, into sustainable economic zones. Jurisdiction over the corporation shifted from the Bases Conversion Development Authority (BCDA) and the Clark Development Corporation (CDC) since its formal incorporation with the SEC in 1995.\n\nIn 2003, President [[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo]] renamed Clark International Airport as the Diosdado Macapagal International Airport (DMIA), in memory of her father, former President [[Diosdado Macapagal]], and ordered the Clark International Airport Corporation (CIAC) in February 2007 to fund the US$1.7 billion (PH\u20b176.5 billion) expansion of DMIA and the approval of a US$2 million (PH\u20b190 million) study plan financed by the Korean International Cooperation Agency. The first stage of Clark Airport's expansion program, a PH\u20b1130 million terminal expansion, was completed in January 2008 to accommodate more than 2 million passengers annually.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sunstar.com.ph/static/pam/2007/12/23/news/korean.firm.prepares.$2m.clark.airport.master.plan..html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080928144135/http://www.sunstar.com.ph/static/pam/2007/12/23/news/korean.firm.prepares.%242m.clark.airport.master.plan..html|url-status=dead|title=Sunstar.com|archivedate=28 September 2008}}</ref>\n\nIn 2011, CIAC was transferred from the [[Bases Conversion and Development Authority]] and became an attached agency of the [[Department of Transportation (Philippines)|Department of Transportation and Communications]] (DOTC) by virtue of Executive Order No. 64 issued by President [[Benigno Aquino III]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.officialgazette.gov.ph/2011/12/21/executive-order-no-64-s-2011/|title=Executive Order No. 64, s. 2011|newspaper=[[Official Gazette (Philippines)|Official Gazette]]|date=21 December 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe airport's name reverted to Clark International Airport in February 2012,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/business/02/28/12/clark-airport-name-change-plan-sparks-debate |title=Clark airport name-change plan sparks debate |publisher=ABS-CBN News |date=28 February 2012}}</ref> but the passenger terminal continued to bear Diosdado Macapagal's name.\n\nOn 28 February 2017, President [[Rodrigo Duterte]] issued Executive Order No. 14, reverting CIAC as a subsidiary of the BCDA, but with the Department of Transportation maintaining supervision and operational control of the airport.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.officialgazette.gov.ph/downloads/2017/02feb/20170228-EO-14-RRD.pdf|title=Executive Order No. 14, s. 2017|newspaper=[[Official Gazette (Philippines)|Official Gazette]]|accessdate=28 June 2019}}</ref>\n\nOn 22 April 2019, the airport was temporarily closed as all flights to and from Clark are canceled due to a [[2019 Luzon earthquake|magnitude 6.1 earthquake]] occurred, originating in [[Zambales]].
