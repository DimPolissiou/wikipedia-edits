Both clans were very proud of the purity of their royal blood and had practised this tradition of inter-marriage since ancient times. For example, [[\u015buddhodana|Suddhodana's]] paternal aunt was married to the Koliyan ruler [[A\u00f1jana]]. Their daughters, [[Mayadevi|Mahamaya]] and [[Mahaprajapati|Mahapajapati Gotami]], were married to [[\u015auddhodana]], the chief of the [[Shakya|Sakyans]]. Similarly, [[Yashodhara]], daughter of [[Suppabuddha]], who was [[A\u00f1jana]]'s son, was married to the Sakyan prince, [[Gautama Buddha]]. Thus, the two royal families were related by marriage bonds between maternal and paternal cousins since ancient times. In spite of such close blood-ties, there would be occasional rifts between the two royal families, which sometimes turned into open hostility.\n\n=== Early ===\nRecords of Koli people exist from at least the 15th century, when rulers in the present-day Gujarat region noted their chieftains as being marauding robbers and [[dacoit]]s. Over a period of several centuries, some of them were able to establish petty chiefdoms throughout the region, mostly comprising just a single village. Although not [[Rajput]]s, this relatively small subset of the Kolis claimed the status of the higher-ranked Rajput community, adopting their customs and intermixing with less significant Rajput families through the practice of [[hypergamy|hypergamous]] marriage,{{sfn|Shah|2012|p=169|ps=}}{{sfn|Jaffrelot|2003|pp=180-182|ps=}} which was commonly used to enhance or secure social status.{{sfn|Fuller|1975|pp=293-295|ps=}} There were significant differences in status throughout the Koli community, however, and little cohesion either geographically or in terms of communal norms, such as the establishment of endogamous marriage groups.{{sfn|Shah|2012|p=170|ps=}}\n\nThrough the colonial [[British Raj]] period and into the 20th century, some Kolis remained significant landholders and tenants,{{sfn|Jaffrelot|2003|pp=180-182|ps=}} although most had never been more than minor landowners and labourers.{{sfn|Shah|2012|p=170|ps=}} The term ''[[Darbar (title)|Darbar]]'' is used to/by kolis. Darbar is equal to ''[[Kshatriya]].'' By this time, however, most Kolis had lost their once-equal standing with the [[Patidar]]{{efn|The Patidars were formerly known as [[Kanbi]], but by 1931 had gained official recognition as Patidar.{{sfn|Basu|2009|pp=51-55|ps=}}}} community due to the land reforms of the Raj period.{{sfn|Basu|2009|pp=51-55|ps=}}.\n\n=== Twentieth century ===\nDuring the later period of the Raj, the Gujarati Kolis became involved in the process of what has subsequently been termed [[sanskritisation]]. At that time, in the 1930s, they represented around 20 percent of the region's population and members of the local Rajput community were seeking to extend their own influence by co-opting other significant groups as claimants to the [[Varna (Hinduism)|ritual title]] of [[Kshatriya]]. The Rajputs were politically, economically and socially marginalised because their own numbers&nbsp;\u2014 around 4 - 5 per cent of the population&nbsp;\u2014 were inferior to the dominant Patidars, with whom the Kolis were also disenchanted. The Kolis were among those whom the Rajputs targeted because, although classified as a [[Criminal Tribes|criminal tribe]] by the British administration, they were among the many communities of that period who had made genealogical claims of descent from the Kshatriya. The Rajput leaders preferred to view the Kolis as being Kshatriya by dint of military ethos rather than origin but, in whatever terminology, it was a marriage of political expedience.{{sfn|Jaffrelot|2003|pp=180-182|ps=}}\n\nIn 1947, around the time that [[Independence of India|India gained independence]], the Kutch, Kathiawar, Gujarat Kshatriya Sabha (KKGKS) caste association emerged as an [[umbrella organisation]] to continue the work begun during the Raj. [[Christophe Jaffrelot]], a French political scientist, says that this body, which claimed to represent the Rajputs and Kolis, \"...&nbsp;is a good example of the way castes, with very different ritual status, join hands to defend their common interests.&nbsp;... The use of the word Kshatriya was largely tactical and the original caste identity was seriously diluted.\"{{sfn|Jaffrelot|2003|pp=180-182|ps=}}\n\nThe relevance of the Kshatriya label in terms of ritual was diminished by the practical actions of the KKGKS which, among other things, saw demands for the constituent communities to be classified as [[Other Backward Class|Backward Classes]] in the Indian [[Reservation in India|scheme for positive discrimination]]. Kshatriyas would not usually wish to be associated with such a category and indeed it runs counter to the theory of Sanskritisation, but in this instance, it suited the socio-economic and political desires. By the 1950s, the KKGKS had established schools, loan systems and other mechanisms of communal self-help and it was demanding reforms to laws relating to land. It was also seeking alliances with political parties at the state level; initially, with the [[Indian National Congress]] and then, by the early 1960s, with the [[Swatantra Party]].\n\nBy 1967, the KKGKS was once again working with Congress because, despite being a haven for Patidars, the party leadership needed the votes of the KKGKS membership. The Kolis gained more from the actions of the KKGKS in these two decades than did the Rajputs, and Jaffrelot believes that it was around this time that a Koli intelligentsia emerged.{{sfn|Jaffrelot|2003|pp=180-182|ps=}} Ghanshyam Shah, a professor at Jawaharlal Nehru University, describes the organisation today as covering a broad group of communities, from disadvantaged Rajputs of high prestige to the semi-tribal [[Bhil people|Bhil]]s, with the Kolis in the middle. He notes that its composition reflects \"a common economic interest and a growing secular identity born partly out of folklore but more out of common resentment against the well-to-do castes\".{{sfn|Shah|2004|p=178|ps=}}\n\nThe Kolis of Gujarat remained educationally and occupationally disadvantaged compared to communities such as the [[Brahmin]]s and Patidars.{{sfn|Shah|2004|p=302|ps=}} Their many [[J\u0101ti]]s include the [[Baria (caste)|Bareeya]], [[Khant caste|Khant]], [[Patanwadia]], [[Talpada]], Chunvalia and [[Thakor]], and they also use ''Koli'' as a suffix, giving rise to groups such as the Gulam Koli and Matia Koli. Some do not refer to themselves as Koli at all.{{sfn|Shah|2004|p=221|ps=}}\n\n== Military Involvement ==\n[[File:Samadhi Of Tanaji Malusare.jpg|thumb|Samadhi of Maratha Koli general ''Sardar Tanajirao Malusare]]\n[[File:Sarkhel Kanhoji Angre I.jpg|thumb|''Sarkhel Kanhoji Raje Angre'', Maratha Koli admiral of Maratha Navy]]\nThe kolis as soldiers served in the all of the [[Princely state|Princely States]] of Gujarat.

Both clans were very proud of the purity of their royal blood and had practised this tradition of inter-marriage since ancient times. For example, [[\u015buddhodana|Suddhodana's]] paternal aunt was married to the Koliyan ruler [[A\u00f1jana]]. Their daughters, [[Mayadevi|Mahamaya]] and [[Mahaprajapati|Mahapajapati Gotami]], were married to [[\u015auddhodana]], the chief of the [[Shakya|Sakyans]]. Similarly, [[Yashodhara]], daughter of [[Suppabuddha]], who was [[A\u00f1jana]]'s son, was married to the Sakyan prince, [[Gautama Buddha]]. Thus, the two royal families were related by marriage bonds between maternal and paternal cousins since ancient times. In spite of such close blood-ties, there would be occasional rifts between the two royal families, which sometimes turned into open hostility.\n\n=== Early ===\nRecords of Koli people exist from at least the 15th century, when rulers in the present-day Gujarat region noted their chieftains as being marauding robbers and [[dacoit]]s. Over a period of several centuries, some of them were able to establish petty chiefdoms throughout the region, mostly comprising just a single village. Although not [[Rajput]]s, this relatively small subset of the Kolis claimed the status of the higher-ranked Rajput community, adopting their customs and intermixing with less significant Rajput families through the practice of [[hypergamy|hypergamous]] marriage,{{sfn|Shah|2012|p=169|ps=}}{{sfn|Jaffrelot|2003|pp=180-182|ps=}} which was commonly used to enhance or secure social status.{{sfn|Fuller|1975|pp=293-295|ps=}} There were significant differences in status throughout the Koli community, however, and little cohesion either geographically or in terms of communal norms, such as the establishment of endogamous marriage groups.{{sfn|Shah|2012|p=170|ps=}}\n\nThrough the colonial [[British Raj]] period and into the 20th century, some Kolis remained significant landholders and tenants,{{sfn|Jaffrelot|2003|pp=180-182|ps=}} although most had never been more than minor landowners and labourers.{{sfn|Shah|2012|p=170|ps=}} The term ''[[Darbar (title)|Darbar]]'' is used to/by kolis. Darbar is equal to ''[[Kshatriya]].'' By this time, however, most Kolis had lost their once-equal standing with the [[Patidar]]{{efn|The Patidars were formerly known as [[Kanbi]], but by 1931 had gained official recognition as Patidar.{{sfn|Basu|2009|pp=51-55|ps=}}}} community due to the land reforms of the Raj period.{{sfn|Basu|2009|pp=51-55|ps=}}.\n\n=== Twentieth century ===\nDuring the later period of the Raj, the Gujarati Kolis became involved in the process of what has subsequently been termed [[sanskritisation]]. At that time, in the 1930s, they represented around 20 percent of the region's population and members of the local Rajput community were seeking to extend their own influence by co-opting other significant groups as claimants to the [[Varna (Hinduism)|ritual title]] of [[Kshatriya]]. The Rajputs were politically, economically and socially marginalised because their own numbers&nbsp;\u2014 around 4 - 5 per cent of the population&nbsp;\u2014 were inferior to the dominant Patidars, with whom the Kolis were also disenchanted. The Kolis were among those whom the Rajputs targeted because, although classified as a [[Criminal Tribes|criminal tribe]] by the British administration, they were among the many communities of that period who had made genealogical claims of descent from the Kshatriya. The Rajput leaders preferred to view the Kolis as being Kshatriya by dint of military ethos rather than origin but, in whatever terminology, it was a marriage of political expedience.{{sfn|Jaffrelot|2003|pp=180-182|ps=}}\n\nIn 1947, around the time that [[Independence of India|India gained independence]], the Kutch, Kathiawar, Gujarat Kshatriya Sabha (KKGKS) caste association emerged as an [[umbrella organisation]] to continue the work begun during the Raj. [[Christophe Jaffrelot]], a French political scientist, says that this body, which claimed to represent the Rajputs and Kolis, \"...&nbsp;is a good example of the way castes, with very different ritual status, join hands to defend their common interests.&nbsp;... The use of the word Kshatriya was largely tactical and the original caste identity was seriously diluted.\"{{sfn|Jaffrelot|2003|pp=180-182|ps=}}\n\nThe relevance of the Kshatriya label in terms of ritual was diminished by the practical actions of the KKGKS which, among other things, saw demands for the constituent communities to be classified as [[Other Backward Class|Backward Classes]] in the Indian [[Reservation in India|scheme for positive discrimination]]. Kshatriyas would not usually wish to be associated with such a category and indeed it runs counter to the theory of Sanskritisation, but in this instance, it suited the socio-economic and political desires. By the 1950s, the KKGKS had established schools, loan systems and other mechanisms of communal self-help and it was demanding reforms to laws relating to land. It was also seeking alliances with political parties at the state level; initially, with the [[Indian National Congress]] and then, by the early 1960s, with the [[Swatantra Party]].\n\nBy 1967, the KKGKS was once again working with Congress because, despite being a haven for Patidars, the party leadership needed the votes of the KKGKS membership. The Kolis gained more from the actions of the KKGKS in these two decades than did the Rajputs, and Jaffrelot believes that it was around this time that a Koli intelligentsia emerged.{{sfn|Jaffrelot|2003|pp=180-182|ps=}} Ghanshyam Shah, a professor at Jawaharlal Nehru University, describes the organisation today as covering a broad group of communities, from disadvantaged Rajputs of high prestige to the semi-tribal [[Bhil people|Bhil]]s, with the Kolis in the middle. He notes that its composition reflects \"a common economic interest and a growing secular identity born partly out of folklore but more out of common resentment against the well-to-do castes\".{{sfn|Shah|2004|p=178|ps=}}\n\nThe Kolis of Gujarat remained educationally and occupationally disadvantaged compared to communities such as the [[Brahmin]]s and Patidars.{{sfn|Shah|2004|p=302|ps=}} Their many [[J\u0101ti]]s include the [[Baria (caste)|Bareeya]], [[Khant caste|Khant]], [[Patanwadia]], [[Talpada]], Chunvalia and [[Thakor]], and they also use ''Koli'' as a suffix, giving rise to groups such as the Gulam Koli and Matia Koli. Some do not refer to themselves as Koli at all.{{sfn|Shah|2004|p=221|ps=}}\n\n== Military Involvement ==\n[[File:Samadhi Of Tanaji Malusare.jpg|thumb|Samadhi of Maratha Koli general ''Sardar Tanajirao Malusare]]\n[[File:Sarkhel Kanhoji Angre I.jpg|thumb|''Sarkhel Kanhoji Raje Angre'', Maratha Koli admiral of Maratha Navy]]\nThe kolis as soldiers served in the all of the [[Princely state|Princely States]] of Gujarat.

By the year 1734, Kolis of Gujarat were well engaged in piracy. They were well known for their infamous activities at sea. The [[Royal Indian Navy|British Navy]] under Radford Nunn attacked Koli pirates and burnt nineteen armed vessels and fifty smalls of Koli pirates after six months, and ten more vessels were fired by British. Nevertheless, Koli pirates were notorious and a challenge for maritime powers. On the 21st January 1739, Koli pirates with some [[Siddi|Siddis]] of [[Murud-Janjira|Janjira]] captured several British vessels, among one of which was the '<nowiki/>''Tiger Gallivat''<nowiki/>'. After a few years in 1749, Koli pirates captured the '''Bengal Ship''<nowiki/>', carrying sixty thousand pounds cash and [[cargo]] worth of equal amount. It was a big shock for the British government, and after that the ''British Navy'' and ''[[Dutch India|Dutch Navy]]'' joined hand together to fight against Koli pirates. In 1750, there was a battle at ''Kurla River'' which resulted in defeat for the Kolis and the capture of 23 armed vessels. After this fight, Koli piracy was silenced for long time. It seems that ''Koli Piracy'' was a headache for all naval powers of India.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Saletore|first=Rajaram Narayan|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=1PVMMoChwY4C&dq=Koli+Pirate&source=gbs_navlinks_s|title=Indian Pirates|date=1978|publisher=Concept Publishing Company|language=en}}</ref>\n\nPrincely states of [[Junagadh State|Junagadh]] and [[Bhavnagar State|Bhavnagar]] also suffered Koli piracy. They infested the shores of [[Saurashtra (state)|Saurashtra]] and plundered several British vessels.

It was produced by Roger Moutenot and recorded at House of David in [[Nashville, Tennessee]]. The album expands the guitar-based pop of its predecessor ''[[Electr-O-Pura]]'' to encompass a variety of other music genres, including [[bossa nova]], [[krautrock]], and [[electronic music]]. Most of the songs on the album deal with melancholy emotions and range from short and fragile ballads to long and open-ended dissonance.\n\nUpon release, ''Beating as One'' reached number 19 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]''{{'}}s [[Top Heatseekers|Heatseekers Albums]] chart, becoming the first Yo La Tengo album to enter the charts. Three songs from the album, \"Autumn Sweater\", \"Sugarcube\", and the cover \"[[Little Honda]]\", were released as [[Single (music)|singles]]. The album received considerable acclaim from [[Music journalism|music critics]], who praised the band's ability to successfully expand the boundaries of nearly any pop style. The album is widely regarded as the band's best work and is frequently included on several publications' best album lists. In 2010, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' placed it at number 86 on its list of 100 Best Albums of the Nineties.\n\n==Background and recording==\n''I Can Hear the Heart Beating as One'' is the follow-up to [[Yo La Tengo]]'s highly acclaimed 1995 album ''[[Electr-O-Pura]]'', which was ranked at number 9 in ''[[The Village Voice]]''{{'}}s 1995 [[Pazz & Jop]] critics' poll.<ref name=\"1995 Pazz & Jop\"/> ''Electr-O-Pura'' marked a new creative direction for the band.<ref name=\"DiS feature\"/> According to singer and guitarist [[Ira Kaplan]], \"I think after ''Electr-O-Pura'' we've had a direction of trying not to worry too hard about what the next album is going to sound like [...] we just write a bunch of songs, and then go one baby step at the time and just do what seems right.\"<ref name=\"DiS feature\"/> At the time, Kaplan also explained that the lyrics used to come last: \"What will really happen is somebody will start playing and we'll all fall in and play for a long time. We'll finish playing an hour later and kinda say, 'Oh, do you remember what you did?' Then we'll write something down\u2014or maybe we won't.\"<ref name=\"The Michigan Daily\"/>\n\n''Beating as One'' was recorded at House of David in [[Nashville, Tennessee]] and produced by Roger Moutenot, who also produced the band's previous two albums.<ref name=\"Creative Music Recording\"/> Kaplan described the recording sessions of the album as follows: \"We hole up in a room and work for a really long time. Then we come out and blink our eyes because it's sunny out\".<ref name=\"The Michigan Daily\"/> Initially, the band did not intend to write a long album, but eventually felt that having a long album was the only way to accommodate the instrumental track \"Spec Bebop\", which the band felt it needed to be included in the album \"by hook or by crook\".<ref name=\"The Michigan Daily\"/> ''Beating as One'' is the only Yo La Tengo album that was recorded on an [[ADAT]] magnetic tape format, even though it was [[Audio mixing|mixed]] to [[Analog signal|analog]] later.<ref name=\"Creative Music Recording\"/> Audio mixing took place at Big House and Magic Shop in [[New York City]].<ref name=\"CD booklet\"/>\n\n==Music and lyrics==\n''Beating as One'' expands ''Electr-O-Pura''{{'}}s guitar-based pop to encompass a variety of other music genres,<ref name=\"AllMusic review\"/> ranging from the [[bossa nova]] soundscapes of \"Center of Gravity\" to the [[Electronic music|electronic]] grooves of \"Autumn Sweater\",<ref name=\"RS review\"/> the [[krautrock]] jams of \"Spec Bebop\",<ref name=\"AllMusic review\"/> the \"[[jazz]]y goof\" of \"Moby Octopad\",<ref name=\"CT review\"/> the [[trip hop]] sound of \"Damage\",<ref name=\"CT review\"/> and the [[psychedelic folk]] instrumentation of \"We're an American Band\", among others.<ref name=\"AllMusic review\"/> The album also contains two cover songs: \"[[Little Honda]]\", a [[The Beach Boys|Beach Boys]] tune written by [[Brian Wilson]] and [[Mike Love]], and \"[[My Little Corner of the World]]\", recorded by [[Anita Bryant]], although the band initially did not know she had ever recorded it.<ref name=\"Pittsburgh Post-Gazette\"/> The former, which is a song that Kaplan learned for a solo guitar show, was originally used to make sure the recording equipment was set up right. However, it was ultimately included in the album because, according to bassist [[James McNew]], \"it just sort of turned out pretty good.\"<ref name=\"Lawrence Journal-World\"/>\n\nThe title to the song \"Moby Octopad\" is a reference to Yo La Tengo's appearance on the 1995 [[Lollapalooza]] tour, where the band performed mid-afternoon sets on the festival's side stage. Often performing earlier in the afternoon was the artist [[Moby]]. One of the instruments that Moby used in his performance was the [[Roland Octapad]], an electronic percussion instrument. When taking the stage for their own performance, Yo La Tengo frequently noticed [[road crew]]'s tape with \"MOBY OCTAPAD\" written on it, still left on the stage after Moby's set.<ref name=\"Big Day Coming\"/> The band later used this anecdote as the title for an instrumental that they were jamming on. Lyrics unrelated to the Moby story were added later.<ref name=\"Big Day Coming\"/>\n\nMost of the lyrics on ''Beating as One'' deal with melancholy emotions.<ref name=\"NME review\"/> The track \"Stockholm Syndrome\", which is the first Yo La Tengo song sung by McNew,<ref name=\"Lawrence Journal-World\"/> is about captives eventually expressing empathy toward their captors and vice versa.<ref name=\"NME review\"/> It was described by prominent music critic [[Robert Christgau]] as a \"simulated [[Neil Young]] ballad\".<ref name=\"Spin review\"/> The song \"Autumn Sweater\", which is layered with complex rhythms and textures,<ref name=\"Alternative music\"/> explores themes of love and lack of communication, while \"Center of Gravity\" has been described as \"a simple [[Lo-fi music|lo-fi]] devotional love song\".<ref name=\"NME review\"/> ''Beating as One'' also marks the debut of Kaplan's [[falsetto]] singing, which was said to blur the line between his voice and that of drummer [[Georgia Hubley]].<ref name=\"Spin feature\"/> The album's title is taken from a line in an unknown film.<ref name=\"The Michigan Daily\"/> According to Kaplan, \"I think it's a nice, evocative title\u2014it seems to mean a lot but it doesn't really mean anything. It comes from a movie, but I'm not telling what movie. You'll have to see it one day and say, 'Eureka!'\"<ref name=\"The Michigan Daily\"/>\n\n==Release==\n''Beating as One'' was released on April 22, 1997, by the independent record label [[Matador Records]] and reached number 19 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]''{{'}}s [[Top Heatseekers|Heatseekers Albums]] chart, becoming the first Yo La Tengo album to enter the charts.<ref name=\"AllMusic awards\"/> Three songs from the album, \"Autumn Sweater\", \"Sugarcube\", and \"Little Honda\", were released as [[Single (music)|singles]] or [[Extended play|EPs]] in 1997.<ref name=\"Autumn Sweater single\"/><ref name=\"Sugarcube EP\"/><ref name=\"Little Honda single\"/> A [[music video]] featuring ''[[Mr. Show with Bob and David]]''{{'}}s comedians [[David Cross]] and [[Bob Odenkirk]] was made for \"Sugarcube\".<ref name=\"Sugarcube video\"/> The song \"Moby Octopad\", which was not released as a single, peaked at number 4 on the [[KEXP-FM|KEXP]] Top 90.3 Album Chart in 1997.<ref name=\"KEXP Album Chart\"/> As of March 2000, ''Beating as One'' has sold 73,000 copies in the U.S. according to [[Nielsen SoundScan]], becoming Yo La Tengo's most commercially successful album at the time.<ref name=\"Album sales\"/> In 2012, ''[[The Daily Beast]]'' reported that the record had peaked at 300,000 copies since release.<ref name=\"Daily Beast sales\"/>\n\n==Critical reception==\n{{Album ratings\n|rev1 = [[AllMusic]]\n|rev1score = {{Rating|5|5}}<ref name=\"AllMusic review\"/>\n|rev2 = ''[[Chicago Tribune]]''\n|rev2score = {{Rating|3.5|4}}<ref name=\"CT review\"/>\n|rev3 = ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''\n|rev3score = A\u2212<ref name=\"EW review\"/>\n|rev4 = ''[[The Guardian]]''\n|rev4score = {{Rating|4|5}}<ref name=\"Guardian review\"/>\n|rev5 = ''[[NME]]''\n|rev5score = 8/10<ref name=\"NME review\"/>\n|rev6 = ''[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]''\n|rev6score = 9.7/10<ref name=\"Pitchfork review\"/>\n|rev7 = ''[[Rolling Stone]]''\n|rev7score = {{Rating|4|5}}<ref name=\"RS review\"/>\n|rev8 = ''[[The Rolling Stone Album Guide]]''\n|rev8score = {{Rating|5|5}}<ref name=\"RS Album Guide review\"/>\n|rev9 = ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]''\n|rev9score = 9/10<ref name=\"Spin review\"/>\n|rev10 = ''[[The Village Voice]]''\n|rev10score = A<ref name=\"Christgau review\"/>\n}}\n\nUpon release, ''Beating as One'' received considerable acclaim from [[Music journalism|music critics]]. Matt Diehl of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' felt that the album \"proves that Yo La Tengo can master nearly any pop style [...] the music's ominousness is undercut by Yo La Tengo's infectious joy at simply making noise. It's just this joy that makes Yo La Tengo stand out amid their [[Indie rock|indie-rock]] peers\".<ref name=\"RS review\"/> Similarly, in his review for ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]'', Robert Christgau said that the album gave the band \"the grace to professionalize toward the pop melodicism they've always loved.\"<ref name=\"Spin review\"/> He also felt that the first nine songs were perfect and considered \"Autumn Sweater\" as the \"very peak\" of the album.<ref name=\"Spin review\"/> ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' reviewer [[Greg Kot]] highlighted the album's diverse influences, stating that the band \"fashions sprawling albums out of minimal instrumental strokes and soft voices.\"<ref name=\"CT review\"/>\n\nThe album's range of power and soft elements was noted. Writing for ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'', David Browne said that, while the band has always been \"adept at striking a balance between hurricane-force dissonance and fragile serenity\", Yo La Tengo \"crack open their sound even wider here. Their muted, after-hours guitar drone is in full effect [...] As adults who still need to make a racket, they remain addicted to noise, but now the trio integrates the [[Audio feedback|feedback]] into the arrangements, like squalls rumbling in the distance.\"<ref name=\"EW review\"/> Dele Fadele of ''[[NME]]'' also praised the open-ended nature of the album, but criticized the instrumental \"Spec Bebop\" for being \"constructed around some hurtful feedback, to end up as an endurance test.\"<ref name=\"NME review\"/> In a very positive review, Jason Josephes of ''[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]'' praised the album for exploring new directions, commenting that the band takes its \"sonic inventions to new levels.\"<ref name=\"Pitchfork review\"/>\n\n''Beating as One'' was ranked number 5 in ''The Village Voice''{{'}}s 1997 Pazz & Jop critics' poll, the band's highest position to date.<ref name=\"1997 Pazz & Jop\"/> In the poll's accompanying essay, Christgau referred to the album as one of his \"favorite albums of the year, easy\", alongside those by [[Pavement (band)|Pavement]], [[Sleater-Kinney]], and [[Arto Lindsay]].<ref name=\"No Next Big Thing\"/> Similarly, editors of ''NME'' magazine placed the album at number 19 in their albums of the year list for 1997,<ref name=\"NME Albums of the Year\"/> while ''Spin'' journalists placed the album at number 8 in their list of Top 20 Albums of the Year.<ref name=\"Spin Best of 1997\"/>\n\n==Legacy==\nRetrospectively, ''Beating as One'' is widely regarded as the band's best work. [[AllMusic]] reviewer Fred Thomas described it as \"a definitive master statement. The subtly shifting moods and wide, curious palette of stylistic exploration resulted in a lasting indie rock classic, essential listening and also something of a blueprint for much of what followed from like-minded bands for years to come.\"<ref name=\"AllMusic review\"/> ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' editor John Krewson remarked that the album marked the point when the band started to \"[dabble] on electronica\" with songs such as \"Moby Octopad\" and \"Autumn Sweater\", calling it \"an example of a band having great fun exploring the possibilities of pop music.\"<ref name=\"AV Club review\"/> In his review of the band's 2003 album ''[[Summer Sun]]'', Christgau praised ''Beating as One'' as Yo La Tengo's \"career album\", commenting that \"It's no challenge or insult to state categorically that they'll never top it.\"<ref name=\"Beating As One\"/> In 2017, ''Pitchfork'' writer [[Marc Hogan]] described the record as the band's \"first true masterpiece.\"<ref name=\"Pitchfork 2017 Review\"/>\n\nThe album is frequently included on several publications' best album lists. In 1999, it was ranked number 78 on ''Spin''{{'}}s list of The 90 Greatest Albums of the '90s.<ref name=\"Spin Top 90\"/> In 2003, ''Pitchfork'' ranked it number 25 on its list of the Top 100 albums of the 1990s.<ref name=\"Pitchfork Top 100\"/> Similarly, ''Rolling Stone'' placed the record at number 86 on its 2010 compilation of 100 Best Albums of the Nineties.<ref name=\"RS Top 100\"/> In 2012, the album appeared at number 22 in ''[[Paste (magazine)|Paste]]''{{'}}s list of The 90 Best Albums of the 1990s.<ref name=\"Paste Top 90\"/>\n\n==Track listing==\n{{tracklist\n| all_writing

It was produced by Roger Moutenot and recorded at House of David in [[Nashville, Tennessee]]. The album expands the guitar-based pop of its predecessor ''[[Electr-O-Pura]]'' to encompass a variety of other music genres, including [[bossa nova]], [[krautrock]], and [[electronic music]]. Most of the songs on the album deal with melancholy emotions and range from short and fragile ballads to long and open-ended dissonance.\n\nUpon release, ''Beating as One'' reached number 19 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]''{{'}}s [[Top Heatseekers|Heatseekers Albums]] chart, becoming the first Yo La Tengo album to enter the charts. Three songs from the album, \"Autumn Sweater\", \"Sugarcube\", and the cover \"[[Little Honda]]\", were released as [[Single (music)|singles]]. The album received considerable acclaim from [[Music journalism|music critics]], who praised the band's ability to successfully expand the boundaries of nearly any pop style. The album is widely regarded as the band's best work and is frequently included on several publications' best album lists. In 2010, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' placed it at number 86 on its list of 100 Best Albums of the Nineties.\n\n==Background and recording==\n''I Can Hear the Heart Beating as One'' is the follow-up to [[Yo La Tengo]]'s highly acclaimed 1995 album ''[[Electr-O-Pura]]'', which was ranked at number 9 in ''[[The Village Voice]]''{{'}}s 1995 [[Pazz & Jop]] critics' poll.<ref name=\"1995 Pazz & Jop\"/> ''Electr-O-Pura'' marked a new creative direction for the band.<ref name=\"DiS feature\"/> According to singer and guitarist [[Ira Kaplan]], \"I think after ''Electr-O-Pura'' we've had a direction of trying not to worry too hard about what the next album is going to sound like [...] we just write a bunch of songs, and then go one baby step at the time and just do what seems right.\"<ref name=\"DiS feature\"/> At the time, Kaplan also explained that the lyrics used to come last: \"What will really happen is somebody will start playing and we'll all fall in and play for a long time. We'll finish playing an hour later and kinda say, 'Oh, do you remember what you did?' Then we'll write something down\u2014or maybe we won't.\"<ref name=\"The Michigan Daily\"/>\n\n''Beating as One'' was recorded at House of David in [[Nashville, Tennessee]] and produced by Roger Moutenot, who also produced the band's previous two albums.<ref name=\"Creative Music Recording\"/> Kaplan described the recording sessions of the album as follows: \"We hole up in a room and work for a really long time. Then we come out and blink our eyes because it's sunny out\".<ref name=\"The Michigan Daily\"/> Initially, the band did not intend to write a long album, but eventually felt that having a long album was the only way to accommodate the instrumental track \"Spec Bebop\", which the band felt it needed to be included in the album \"by hook or by crook\".<ref name=\"The Michigan Daily\"/> ''Beating as One'' is the only Yo La Tengo album that was recorded on an [[ADAT]] magnetic tape format, even though it was [[Audio mixing|mixed]] to [[Analog signal|analog]] later.<ref name=\"Creative Music Recording\"/> Audio mixing took place at Big House and Magic Shop in [[New York City]].<ref name=\"CD booklet\"/>\n\n==Music and lyrics==\n''Beating as One'' expands ''Electr-O-Pura''{{'}}s guitar-based pop to encompass a variety of other music genres,<ref name=\"AllMusic review\"/> ranging from the [[bossa nova]] soundscapes of \"Center of Gravity\" to the [[Electronic music|electronic]] grooves of \"Autumn Sweater\",<ref name=\"RS review\"/> the [[krautrock]] jams of \"Spec Bebop\",<ref name=\"AllMusic review\"/> the \"[[jazz]]y goof\" of \"Moby Octopad\",<ref name=\"CT review\"/> the [[trip hop]] sound of \"Damage\",<ref name=\"CT review\"/> and the [[psychedelic folk]] instrumentation of \"We're an American Band\", among others.<ref name=\"AllMusic review\"/> The album also contains two cover songs: \"[[Little Honda]]\", a [[The Beach Boys|Beach Boys]] tune written by [[Brian Wilson]] and [[Mike Love]], and \"[[My Little Corner of the World]]\", recorded by [[Anita Bryant]], although the band initially did not know she had ever recorded it.<ref name=\"Pittsburgh Post-Gazette\"/> The former, which is a song that Kaplan learned for a solo guitar show, was originally used to make sure the recording equipment was set up right. However, it was ultimately included in the album because, according to bassist [[James McNew]], \"it just sort of turned out pretty good.\"<ref name=\"Lawrence Journal-World\"/>\n\nThe title to the song \"Moby Octopad\" is a reference to Yo La Tengo's appearance on the 1995 [[Lollapalooza]] tour, where the band performed mid-afternoon sets on the festival's side stage. Often performing earlier in the afternoon was the artist [[Moby]]. One of the instruments that Moby used in his performance was the [[Roland Octapad]], an electronic percussion instrument. When taking the stage for their own performance, Yo La Tengo frequently noticed [[road crew]]'s tape with \"MOBY OCTAPAD\" written on it, still left on the stage after Moby's set.<ref name=\"Big Day Coming\"/> The band later used this anecdote as the title for an instrumental that they were jamming on. Lyrics unrelated to the Moby story were added later.<ref name=\"Big Day Coming\"/>\n\nMost of the lyrics on ''Beating as One'' deal with melancholy emotions.<ref name=\"NME review\"/> The track \"Stockholm Syndrome\", which is the first Yo La Tengo song sung by McNew,<ref name=\"Lawrence Journal-World\"/> is about captives eventually expressing empathy toward their captors and vice versa.<ref name=\"NME review\"/> It was described by prominent music critic [[Robert Christgau]] as a \"simulated [[Neil Young]] ballad\".<ref name=\"Spin review\"/> The song \"Autumn Sweater\", which is layered with complex rhythms and textures,<ref name=\"Alternative music\"/> explores themes of love and lack of communication, while \"Center of Gravity\" has been described as \"a simple [[Lo-fi music|lo-fi]] devotional love song\".<ref name=\"NME review\"/> ''Beating as One'' also marks the debut of Kaplan's [[falsetto]] singing, which was said to blur the line between his voice and that of drummer [[Georgia Hubley]].<ref name=\"Spin feature\"/> The album's title is taken from a line in an unknown film.<ref name=\"The Michigan Daily\"/> According to Kaplan, \"I think it's a nice, evocative title\u2014it seems to mean a lot but it doesn't really mean anything. It comes from a movie, but I'm not telling what movie. You'll have to see it one day and say, 'Eureka!'\"<ref name=\"The Michigan Daily\"/>\n\n==Release==\n''Beating as One'' was released on April 22, 1997, by the independent record label [[Matador Records]] and reached number 19 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]''{{'}}s [[Top Heatseekers|Heatseekers Albums]] chart, becoming the first Yo La Tengo album to enter the charts.<ref name=\"AllMusic awards\"/> Three songs from the album, \"Autumn Sweater\", \"Sugarcube\", and \"Little Honda\", were released as [[Single (music)|singles]] or [[Extended play|EPs]] in 1997.<ref name=\"Autumn Sweater single\"/><ref name=\"Sugarcube EP\"/><ref name=\"Little Honda single\"/> A [[music video]] featuring ''[[Mr. Show with Bob and David]]''{{'}}s comedians [[David Cross]] and [[Bob Odenkirk]] was made for \"Sugarcube\".<ref name=\"Sugarcube video\"/> The song \"Moby Octopad\", which was not released as a single, peaked at number 4 on the [[KEXP-FM|KEXP]] Top 90.3 Album Chart in 1997.<ref name=\"KEXP Album Chart\"/> As of March 2000, ''Beating as One'' has sold 73,000 copies in the U.S. according to [[Nielsen SoundScan]], becoming Yo La Tengo's most commercially successful album at the time.<ref name=\"Album sales\"/> In 2012, ''[[The Daily Beast]]'' reported that the record had peaked at 300,000 copies since release.<ref name=\"Daily Beast sales\"/>\n\n==Critical reception==\n{{Album ratings\n|rev1 = [[AllMusic]]\n|rev1score = {{Rating|5|5}}<ref name=\"AllMusic review\"/>\n|rev2 = ''[[Chicago Tribune]]''\n|rev2Score = {{Rating|3.5|4}}<ref name=\"CT review\"/>\n|rev3 = ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''\n|rev3Score = A\u2212<ref name=\"EW review\"/>\n|rev4 = ''[[The Guardian]]''\n|rev4Score = {{Rating|4|5}}<ref name=\"Guardian review\"/>\n|rev5 = ''[[NME]]''\n|rev5score = 8/10<ref name=\"NME review\"/>\n|rev6 = ''[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]''\n|rev6score = 9.7/10<ref name=\"Pitchfork review\"/>\n|rev7 = ''[[Rolling Stone]]''\n|rev7score = {{Rating|4|5}}<ref name=\"RS review\"/>\n|rev8 = ''[[The Rolling Stone Album Guide]]''\n|rev8score = {{Rating|5|5}}<ref name=\"RS Album Guide review\"/>\n|rev9 = ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]''\n|rev9score = 9/10<ref name=\"Spin review\"/>\n|rev10 = ''[[The Village Voice]]''\n|rev10score = A<ref name=\"Christgau review\"/>\n}}\n\nUpon release, ''Beating as One'' received considerable acclaim from [[Music journalism|music critics]]. Matt Diehl of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' felt that the album \"proves that Yo La Tengo can master nearly any pop style [...] the music's ominousness is undercut by Yo La Tengo's infectious joy at simply making noise. It's just this joy that makes Yo La Tengo stand out amid their [[Indie rock|indie-rock]] peers\".<ref name=\"RS review\"/> Similarly, in his review for ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]'', Robert Christgau said that the album gave the band \"the grace to professionalize toward the pop melodicism they've always loved.\"<ref name=\"Spin review\"/> He also felt that the first nine songs were perfect and considered \"Autumn Sweater\" as the \"very peak\" of the album.<ref name=\"Spin review\"/> ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' reviewer [[Greg Kot]] highlighted the album's diverse influences, stating that the band \"fashions sprawling albums out of minimal instrumental strokes and soft voices.\"<ref name=\"CT review\"/>\n\nThe album's range of power and soft elements was noted. Writing for ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'', David Browne said that, while the band has always been \"adept at striking a balance between hurricane-force dissonance and fragile serenity\", Yo La Tengo \"crack open their sound even wider here. Their muted, after-hours guitar drone is in full effect [...] As adults who still need to make a racket, they remain addicted to noise, but now the trio integrates the [[Audio feedback|feedback]] into the arrangements, like squalls rumbling in the distance.\"<ref name=\"EW review\"/> Dele Fadele of ''[[NME]]'' also praised the open-ended nature of the album, but criticized the instrumental \"Spec Bebop\" for being \"constructed around some hurtful feedback, to end up as an endurance test.\"<ref name=\"NME review\"/> In a very positive review, Jason Josephes of ''[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]'' praised the album for exploring new directions, commenting that the band takes its \"sonic inventions to new levels.\"<ref name=\"Pitchfork review\"/>\n\n''Beating as One'' was ranked number 5 in ''The Village Voice''{{'}}s 1997 Pazz & Jop critics' poll, the band's highest position to date.<ref name=\"1997 Pazz & Jop\"/> In the poll's accompanying essay, Christgau referred to the album as one of his \"favorite albums of the year, easy\", alongside those by [[Pavement (band)|Pavement]], [[Sleater-Kinney]], and [[Arto Lindsay]].<ref name=\"No Next Big Thing\"/> Similarly, editors of ''NME'' magazine placed the album at number 19 in their albums of the year list for 1997,<ref name=\"NME Albums of the Year\"/> while ''Spin'' journalists placed the album at number 8 in their list of Top 20 Albums of the Year.<ref name=\"Spin Best of 1997\"/>\n\n==Legacy==\nRetrospectively, ''Beating as One'' is widely regarded as the band's best work. [[AllMusic]] reviewer Fred Thomas described it as \"a definitive master statement. The subtly shifting moods and wide, curious palette of stylistic exploration resulted in a lasting indie rock classic, essential listening and also something of a blueprint for much of what followed from like-minded bands for years to come.\"<ref name=\"AllMusic review\"/> ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' editor John Krewson remarked that the album marked the point when the band started to \"[dabble] on electronica\" with songs such as \"Moby Octopad\" and \"Autumn Sweater\", calling it \"an example of a band having great fun exploring the possibilities of pop music.\"<ref name=\"AV Club review\"/> In his review of the band's 2003 album ''[[Summer Sun]]'', Christgau praised ''Beating as One'' as Yo La Tengo's \"career album\", commenting that \"It's no challenge or insult to state categorically that they'll never top it.\"<ref name=\"Beating As One\"/> In 2017, ''Pitchfork'' writer [[Marc Hogan]] described the record as the band's \"first true masterpiece.\"<ref name=\"Pitchfork 2017 Review\"/>\n\nThe album is frequently included on several publications' best album lists. In 1999, it was ranked number 78 on ''Spin''{{'}}s list of The 90 Greatest Albums of the '90s.<ref name=\"Spin Top 90\"/> In 2003, ''Pitchfork'' ranked it number 25 on its list of the Top 100 albums of the 1990s.<ref name=\"Pitchfork Top 100\"/> Similarly, ''Rolling Stone'' placed the record at number 86 on its 2010 compilation of 100 Best Albums of the Nineties.<ref name=\"RS Top 100\"/> In

Watercolour by Sarah Stone.jpg|thumb|right|Perspective interior view of Sir Ashton Lever's Museum in Leicester Square, London 30 March 1785]]\nLever began by collecting [[seashell]]s in about 1760, and gradually accumulated one of the richest private collections of natural objects, including live animals. He opened it to the public in April 1766, in [[Manchester]], moving the museum to his family home at Alkrington Hall, near [[Rochdale]], [[Lancashire]], in 1771. In the same year he founded Archers' Hall, Inner Circle, Regent's Park, London for the Archers' Company of the [[Honourable Artillery Company]]. In 1774, Lever moved to London, and next year his [[Holophusicon]] opened to the public in [[Leicester Square]]. Captain [[James Cook]] was impressed by Lever's collection, and donated objects from his own voyages to the museum.\n\nLever continued to buy items until he became bankrupt, at which point the collection contained 28,000 specimens. Both the [[British Museum]] and the [[Catherine the Great|Empress of Russia]] declined to buy it, so it was disposed of by lottery: 8,000 tickets were sold at a guinea each. The winner, [[James Parkinson (1730\u20131813)|James Parkinson]], later put the collection up for auction in 1806, when the largest purchasers were the British naturalist [[Edward Donovan]] and [[Leopold von Fichtel]], bidding on behalf of the [[Natural History Museum, Vienna]]. Purchasers included the [[Edward Smith-Stanley, 13th Earl of Derby|Earl of Derby]] and [[William Bullock (collector)|William Bullock]], who had a large private collection.\n\nLever's collection was catalogued by [[George Shaw]].\n\n== References ==\n<references />\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{cite book\n | last1 = Waterfield\n | first1 = Hermione\n | last2 = King\n | first2 = J.

Watercolour by Sarah Stone.jpg|thumb|right|Perspective interior view of Sir Ashton Lever's Museum in Leicester Square, London 30 March 1785]]\nLever began by collecting [[seashell]]s in about 1760, and gradually accumulated one of the richest private collections of natural objects, including live animals. He opened it to the public in April 1766, in [[Manchester]], moving the museum to his family home at Alkrington Hall, near [[Rochdale]], [[Lancashire]], in 1771. In the same year he founded Archers' Hall, Inner Circle, Regent's Park, London for the Archers' Company of the [[Honourable Artillery Company]]. In 1774, Lever moved to London, and next year his [[Holophusicon]] opened to the public in [[Leicester Square]]. Captain [[James Cook]] was impressed by Lever's collection, and donated objects from his own voyages to the museum.\n\nLever continued to buy items until he became bankrupt, at which point the collection contained 28,000 specimens. Both the [[British Museum]] and the [[Catherine the Great|Empress of Russia]] declined to buy it, so it was disposed of by lottery: 8,000 tickets were sold at a guinea each. The winner, [[James Parkinson (1730\u20131813)|James Parkinson]], later put the collection up for auction in 1806, when the largest purchasers were the British naturalist [[Edward Donovan]] and [[Leopold von Fichtel]], bidding on behalf of the [[Natural History Museum, Vienna]]. Purchasers included the [[Edward Smith-Stanley, 13th Earl of Derby|Earl of Derby]] and [[William Bullock (collector)|William Bullock]], who had a large private collection.\n\nLever's collection was catalogued by [[George Shaw]].\n\n== References ==\n<references />\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{cite book\n | last1 = Waterfield\n | first1 = Hermione\n | last2 = King\n | first2 = J.

Cleckley]], first published in 1941, describing Cleckley's clinical interviews with patients in a locked institution. The text is considered to be a seminal work and the most influential clinical description of [[psychopathy]] in the twentieth century. The basic elements of psychopathy outlined by Cleckley are still relevant today.<ref>\n{{cite web\n|url= http://law.jrank.org/pages/1884/Psychopathy-What-psychopathy.html\n|title=Psychopathy \u2013 What Is Psychopathy? | accessdate=2007-12-14}}</ref>\nThe title refers to the normal \"[[mask]]\" that conceals the [[mental disorder]] of the psychopathic person in Cleckley's conceptualization.<ref name=\"meloy\">\n{{cite book\n| last = Meloy | first = J.

Despite the seemingly sincere, intelligent, even charming external presentation, internally the psychopathic person does not have the ability to experience genuine emotions. Cleckley questions whether this mask of sanity is voluntarily assumed to intentionally hide the lack of internal structure, but concludes it hides a serious, but yet imprecisely unidentified, semantic neuropsychiatric defect.<ref>Cleckley, p. 238</ref> Six editions of the book were produced in total, the final shortly after his death. An expanded fifth edition of the book had been published in 1976 and was re-released by his heirs in 1988 for non-profit educational use.\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of psychopathy}}\nIn the 1800s, [[Philippe Pinel]] first used the French term ''manie sans delire'' (\"mania without delirium\") to designate those individuals engaging in deviant behavior but exhibiting no signs of a [[cognitive disorder]] such as [[hallucination]]s or [[delusion]]s. Although the meaning of the term has changed through numerous writings on the subject over time, the writing of Cleckley and his use of the label \"psychopath\" in ''The Mask of Sanity'' brought the term into popular usage.<ref name=\"meloy\"/>\n\n==Editions==\nThe first edition was published in 1941, with the subtitle then being 'An attempt to re-interpret' rather than as later 'to clarify'. Cleckley says in the preface that the book \"grew out of an old conviction which increased during several years while I sat at staff meetings in a large [[neuropsychiatric]] hospital\". He added that after commencing full-time teaching duties he found similar patients to be as prevalent in a general hospital, outpatient clinic and the community. In later editions he explains that the basic concepts presented in 1941 were based primarily on \"adult male psychopaths hospitalized in a closed institution\" for several years. Cleckley had worked for a number of years at a [[Veterans Health Administration|United States Veterans (military) Administration]] hospital, before taking up full-time teaching responsibilities at the University of Georgia School of Medicine.\n\nThe second edition published in 1950, Cleckley has described as a \"new and much larger book\", based on more diverse clinical observations, feedback and literature reviews. The third edition in 1955 he describes as having fewer changes and additions, but important clarifications to key concepts such as the hypothesis of a core semantic deficit. A fourth edition was published in 1964.\n\nA fifth edition was published in 1976 ({{ISBN|0801609852}}) and is generally considered to be the definitive culmination of Cleckley's work. The preface does not specify the changes made. Unlike the first edition it states: \"Dr. [[Corbett H. Thigpen]], my medical associate of many years, has played a major part in the development and the revision of this work.\" Cleckley also states that it could not have been written without the assistance and contributions of Thigpen's wife and his own (first), both called Louise. A sixth edition was published shortly after Cleckley's death in 1984, but is described by others as having minimal substantive changes.<ref name=Stover2008>[https://books.google.com/books?id=R-xvEzVD7CAC A Critical Analysis of the Historical and Conceptual Evolution of Psychopathy] By Andrew R. Stover. ProQuest, 2008. Chapter 4: Hervey Cleckley's The Mask of Sanity</ref> Several further years after Cleckley's death, another fifth edition ({{ISBN|0962151904}}) was released for non-profit educational use by Emily S. Cleckley, his second wife, naming her as well as Hervey M. Cleckley and copyrighted 1988 to her rather than [[Mosby (imprint)|Mosby]] as for all prior initial releases (which have been repeat published in various different years).<ref>[http://www.cassiopaea.org/cass/sanity_1.PdF The Mask of Sanity - 5th edition], 1988, \"scanned facsimile produced for non-profit educational use\"</ref>\n\n==Description==\n''The Mask of Sanity'', fifth edition, presents clinical theories as well as case studies, written in the form of dramatic, novelistic descriptions of 13 individuals, an amalgamation of those he had observed.\n\n===Initial outline===\n''The Mask of Sanity'' begins in Section One, \"An Outline of the Problem\", by considering the concept of [[sanity]], which Cleckley describes as [[protean]]. The first words of the book are a possibly untrue anecdote ending with the line, capitalized and centered in large font, \"WHO'S LOONEY NOW?\" Cleckley suggests that everyone \"behaves at times with something short of complete rationality and good judgment\". He notes that many types of people hold beliefs that he and much of society would consider irrational, such as [[mysticism]], [[pseudoscience]], praising of unintelligible or immoral works (e.g. acclaim for the novel ''[[Finnegans Wake]]'' containing only \"erudite gibberish\" or for the writing of [[Andr\u00e9 Gide]] on [[pederasty]]), and religious faith. He argues, however, that these are personal freedoms and such groups are usually capable of leading useful lives in harmony with others. This he says distinguishes it from [[psychosis]] once fully developed and from psychopathy.<ref name=Stover2008/>\n\n====Classification schemes====\nCleckley also addresses the confusing traditions of classification in the area of psychopathy, a term he admits is itself confusing and not being used in line with its [[etymological]] meaning ('mental sickness'), though adopts it as the most familiar and apparently durable. He considers the terms sociopathic personality and antisocial personality, as adopted by the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]; the relationship to the overall category of [[personality disorder]]; and the earlier widespread concept of \"constitutional psychopathic inferiority\", disputing its hereditary assumptions. He states that the main purpose of the book is to bring a few cases before other psychiatrists, and also to raise the profile among the public, to enable better management of psychopaths. He criticizes the '[[doctrine]] of [[Permissive society|permissiveness]]', and refers with regret to the lack of prominence of psychopathy in psychiatric textbooks.\n\n====Prevalence====\nCleckley argues under a subsection titled \"Not as single spies but in battalions\" (a phrase appearing in ''[[Hamlet]]''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/407600.html|title=When sorrows come, they come not single spies, but in battalions|author=Phrase Finder is copyright Gary Martin, 1996-2015. All rights reserved.|work=phrases.org.uk}}</ref>), that although reliable statistics are hard to come by, there are various reasons to suspect both psychiatric and prison admission rates are an underestimate, and the [[Incidence (epidemiology)|incidence]] of the condition is in his opinion \"exceedingly high\". He does present some statistics from a survey whereby he and nine other psychiatrists diagnosed 1/8th of patients as having psychopathic personality without any other mental disorder that might explain the condition, and considers that quite a few others classified as alcoholic or drug addicted would actually have qualified too. Their survey is further detailed in the book's appendix, where Cleckley clarifies it took place between 1937 and 1939 at a federal [[Veterans Administration]] hospital, located on the [[Southeastern United States|Southeastern]] seaboard, for the care of ex-service men, mainly from [[World War I]]. He critiques the 'benign policy' of the VA of not diagnosing more psychopathic personality due to giving the benefit of the doubt to issues such as [[neurasthenia]], [[hysteria]], [[psychasthenia]], [[Posttraumatic stress disorder|posttraumatic neuroses]], or [[cerebral trauma]] from [[skull]] injuries and [[concussions]]. He concludes they have \"records of the utmost folly and misery and idleness over many years\" and if considering the number in every community who are protected by relatives, \"the [[prevalence]] of this disorder is seen to be appalling.\"\n\n====Method====\nFinally, Cleckley asserts that the account provided in his book will accord with the [[scientific method]], as pointed out by [[Karl Pearson]] in ''[[The Grammar of Science]]'', which he loosely summarizes as: to record observed facts; group them together by correlation as distinguished from other facts; to try to summarize or explain in a way that indicates the significance. He also says his method takes inspiration from that used in an earlier work, ''The Psychology of Insanity'' by English physician [[Bernard Hart]] (first edition published in 1912 and now open access<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/psychologyofinsa00hartrich|title=The psychology of insanity|work=Internet Archive}}</ref>).\n\n===Characteristics===\nIn Section Two, \"The Material\", Cleckley presents a typical \"full\" psychopath's behavior in a series of 15 [[Vignette (literature)|vignettes]] (originally nine in the first edition, and all male). For example, the psychopath can typically tell vivid, lifelike, plausible stories that are completely fraudulent, without evincing any element of delusion. When confronted with a lie, the psychopath is unflappable and can often effortlessly pass it off as a joke. In another typical case history, the psychopath is hospitalized for psychiatric treatment but because of his constant trouble-making, leaving wards in an uproar, the hospital is finally forced to turn him over to the police. Eventually, the police become so sick of his repeated antics that they try to hospitalize him again.\n\nAlso included are six vignettes of \"Incomplete manifestations or suggestions of the disorder\" in non-patients, such as \"The businessman\", \"The gentleman\" or \"The physician\".\n\n===Differentiation===\nIn Section Three, 'Cataloging the material', Cleckley continues the conceptual outline started in Section One, now termed 'Orientation'. He criticises the tenets of [[faculty psychology]] (now known as [[modularity of mind]]), arguing that such things as intelligence, morality and emotions are not separate parts in the brain but separate concepts we apply. He believes psychopaths would have been included in the 19th century concepts of 'mania without insanity' by [[Philippe Pinel]] and Prichard's [[moral insanity]], but rejects their faculty basis. He notes the confusingly broad literal meaning and practical usage of the terms psychopathic personality or personality disorder, giving the example of the most authoritative textbook of the second quarter of the century, ''Psychopathic Personalities,'' by German psychiatrist [[Eugen Kahn]].\n\nHe rails against the [[counterculture]] [[antihero]] and gives as an example the novelist Alan Harrington<ref>https://www.nytimes.com/1997/05/28/arts/alan-harrington-79-novelist-known-for-his-black-humor.html</ref> for suggesting a socially necessary role for psychopathy in modern times, calling the idea \"perverse and degenerate\". He also criticizes [[Freud]]ian-inspired ideas about antisocial acts being caused by unconscious guilt. He also disagrees with theories of neurotic, emotional or paranoid problems in subtypes of psychopathy, as in his concept there is always a relative or complete lack of this. He says the new DSM \"personality disorder, antisocial type\" offers an accurate term equivalent to psychopathy which he thinks will also continue as a term for a long time.<ref>The Mask of Sanity, Fifth edition, pp 225 - 243</ref>\n\n====Psychosis====\nCleckley then considers how [[schizophrenia]] is different from psychopathy, having a defect in theoretical reasoning. He notes that [[schizoid]] disorders may appear more similar, and might be more accurately called \"masked schizophrenia\", which he notes can sometimes be difficult to differentiate from psychopathy. He also notes other 'disguises' of severe personality disorder, such as \"cryptic depression\" or \"pseudoneurotic schizophrenia\" or \"pseudopsychopathic schizophrenia\". He finds the diagnosis of \"psychosis with psychopathic personality\" unnecessarily confusing. He declares, \"There is little point in devoting space to detailed accounts of [[paranoid]] or [[cyclothymic]] personalities.\"\n\nIn the first edition Cleckley described his psychopathic patients as \"frankly and unquestionably psychotic\", but modified this in later editions. In the fifth edition he describes long ago changing his opinion and now agreeing with the psychiatrist [[Richard L. Jenkins]] that this would stretch the definition of psychosis too far.<ref>Mask of Sanity, fifth edition, pg 367-371, 423</ref><ref name=\"HareNeumann2008\">{{cite journal |doi=10.1146/annurev.clinpsy.3.022806.091452 |title=Psychopathy as a Clinical and Empirical Construct |year=2008 |last1=Hare |first1=Robert D. |last2=Neumann |first2=Craig S. |journal=Annual Review of Clinical Psychology |volume=4 |pages=217\u201346 |pmid=18370617|url=http://www.hare.org/references/HareandNeumannARCP2008.pdf}}</ref> However at various other points it is still suggested that, despite \"traditional\" classification, the extent of the inner abnormality and associated dysfunction in psychopathy is such that it might be considered a psychosis in many respects.<ref>The Mask of Sanity, fifth edition, pgs 339,382, 387</ref>\n\n====Criminality====\nCleckley draws important distinctions between the psychopath and non-psychopathic criminal.<ref>Cleckley, pp. 249\u2013252</ref> He states that the psychopath very seldom takes much advantage of any gain, has an obscure or inconsistent purpose, usually puts himself unnecessarily in a shameful position as much as causing trouble for others; and usually does not commit the most serious or violent crimes, but usually does end up harming himself. However, despite the general picture of weak-willed and inconsistent antisocial behavior, he also states, at least in later editions, that some may develop drives towards the most serious or sadistic crimes. He suggests this is a somewhat separate additional pathology but does not explain why or how.\n\nCleckely considers that the concept of [[wikt:delinquency|delinquency]] has much in common with his concept of psychopathy, and argues that it could be considered a mild version if it continues for a long time and is generalized. He notes that many respectable mature productive citizens can look back on short periods of unprovoked social misconduct, including such things as property damage, [[racism]], [[bestiality]], [[voyeurism]], rebellion, and [[promiscuity]]. On the other hand, he notes prolonged but prescribed behavioral disorder in the case of a woman who remained for some time \"irrationally promiscuous and [[bisexual]]\", but who had plausible psychological reasons for her behavior and was otherwise functional in her work and life. He also notes he no longer considers that [[homosexuality]] should be classed as sexual psychopathy, on the grounds that many homosexuals seem to be able to live productive lives in society. He considers that sexual [[fetishes]] are not particularly consistent with psychopaths, as the latter tend to have weak drives. However, paradoxically, he then states that psychopathy can be associated with particular [[sadistic personality disorder|sadistic]] drives and often be responsible for the most serious [[sex crime]]s.\n\n====Other conditions====\nHe distinguishes psychopaths from non-psychopathic [[alcoholics]], who by contrast have a purpose for drinking such as to avoid reality, and may want and try to change, whereas the psychopath appears to drink simply to behave outrageously and get into trouble. He also separates [[psychoneurotics]] (though accepts there may sometimes be overlap) and \"[[mental retardation|mental defectives]]\" (who unlike the psychopath will test poorly on theoretical intelligence tests as well as in behavior in life). The psychopath does not suffer from any obvious mental disorder but in the end seems to deliberately court failure and disaster for no obvious reason and despite intelligence, in what Cleckley calls a social and spiritual suicide.\n\nCleckley then considers whether psychopathy may be erratic [[genius]]. In surveying some noted literary works embodying what he describes as \"malignantly perverse attitudes\", such as by [[Paul Verlaine]], [[Dostoevski]], [[Marquis de Sade]], [[Baudelaire]] and [[Swinburne]] (some associated with the [[Decadent movement]]), he suggests that it might be a form of psychopathy, and might appeal to similarly disordered people or to \"new cults of intellectual defeatists and deviates\" such as certain [[avant garde]] groups. However he concludes that such artworks and sexual deviations are more likely due to [[schizoid]] disorder with [[misanthropy]] and life perversion, whereas the \"true psychopath\" would not labor to produce art extolling pathologic or perverse attitudes; on the contrary, they would tend to superficially proclaim belief in a normal, moral life. However, Cleckley then suggests that initial potential for greatness and emotional depth may cause problems, such as being more affected by problems in life, that then leads into psychopathy.\n\n====Fiction and ancient history====\nCleckley then surveys numerous characters in fictional works that he considers to be portrayals of psychopathy. He concludes by addressing figures in history, excluding [[Adolf Hitler]] and others from his definition but highlighting [[Alcibiades]], a [[General officer|military general]] and politician in [[Ancient Greece]]. He describes a fascination with him growing out an old conviction in the \"paradoxical\" nature of his life, since learning of it in high school. He concludes that Alcibiades \"had the gift of every talent except that of using them consistently to achieve any sensible aim or in behalf of any discernible cause\" and he \"may have been a spectacular example of...the psychopath\", that \"still inexplicable pattern of human life\".<ref>The Mask of Sanity, 5th Edition, 316-336</ref>\n\n===Profile===\nCleckley then summarizes the material and provides a 'clinical profile', describing 16 behavioral characteristics of a psychopath (reduced from 21 in the first edition):\n<ref>Cleckley, pp.338-339 (5th ed.)</ref>\n#[[Superficial charm]] and good intelligence\n#Absence of delusions and other signs of irrational thinking\n#Absence of nervousness or [[neurosis|psychoneurotic]] manifestations\n#Unreliability\n#Untruthfulness and insincerity\n#Lack of [[remorse]] and [[shame]]\n#Inadequately motivated [[antisocial behavior]]\n#Poor judgment and failure to learn by experience\n#Pathologic [[egocentricity]] and incapacity for [[love]]\n#General poverty in major affective reactions\n#Specific loss of [[Insight in psychology and psychiatry|insight]]\n#Unresponsiveness in general interpersonal relations\n#Fantastic and uninviting behavior with drink and sometimes without\n#[[Suicide]] threats rarely carried out\n#[[Human sexual behavior|Sex life]] impersonal, trivial, and poorly integrated\n#Failure to follow any life plan.\n\nSome of the criteria have obvious [[psychodynamic]] implications, such as a lack of remorse, poor judgment, failure to learn from experience, pathological egocentricity, lack of capacity for love, a general poverty in major affective reactions, and lack of insight into his own condition.<ref name=\"meloy\"/> Starting in 1972, newer editions of the book reflected a closer alliance with [[Kernberg]]'s (1984) [[borderline personality|borderline level]] of [[Personality psychology|personality]] organization, specifically defining the structural criteria of the psychopath's [[Identity (social science)|identity]] integration, [[Defence mechanism|defensive operations]] and [[reality testing]].<ref>Meloy, p. 10</ref>\n\n===Pathology and causes===\nIn Section Four, \"Some Questions Still Without Answers\", Cleckley discusses his concept of \"semantic\" dementia (used today to refer to a [[dementia|medical disorder]] unconnected to Cleckley's meaning) or, in later editions, semantic disorder or deficit. He referred to a [[hypothesized]] neurological condition which would be the underlying [[pathology]] linking together and explaining all the different personalities classed as psychopathy by Cleckley. By semantic he meant the ability to emotionally experience or understand \"the meaning of life as lived by ordinary people\". He acknowledged there was no proof or even evidence that this was the underlying condition, but believed that it helped explain the traits and behaviors he observed. As an example to explain the kind of distinction he was drawing between an ability to appear superficially normal despite a core deficit in meaning, he made an [[analogy]] to a neurological [[language disorder]] known as semantic [[aphasia]].<ref>The Mask of Sanity, fifth edition, pages 376-387</ref>\n\nCleckley concludes from his clinical experience that the cause of the disorder of psychopathy is probably not, in general, demonstrably [[psychodynamic]] or even [[Psychogenic disease|psychogenic]], although life influences may play a role in some cases and he notes the progression of the disorder can seem like a kind of social and spiritual (but not actual) suicide, or \"semi-suicide\". He suggests rather that a subtle yet profound defect at a fundamental biological level, probably [[Congenital disorder|inborn]] in some sense but not [[hereditary]] (gives the example of [[agenesis]] of the [[embryo]]) could be the main cause. He admits \"This, too, is still a speculative concept and is not supported by demonstrable evidence.\" Having called it a defect, he notes that it would be \"one that affects complex mechanisms of integration in a subtle and abstruse manner\", and as such could actually sometimes be a positive trait or ability which could nevertheless end up bringing about personal problems in society.<ref>The Mask of Sanity, 5th Edition, pp 403-415</ref>\n\n===Treatment or control===\nCleckley writes in the fifth edition that he remains, since before the first edition, profoundly struck both by the lack of response to treatment of those he classes as psychopathic, and by the legal difficulty of trying to detain them in hospital. While noting the issue of the protection of liberty, he argues that better ways must be found to do the latter for their own good and that of society, on the primary basis of demonstrated disability and need, perhaps within psychiatric units but segregated from other patients. He notes that neither psychological therapy or physical methods such as [[Electroconvulsive therapy|shock therapy]] or [[lobotomy]] appear to be a real solution to the problem, but suggests that more opportunity to control and direct the person may help psychiatrists treat them in the long-run.<ref>Mask of Sanity, Fifth edition, Pg 433-446</ref> He also considers the issue of [[Competency evaluation (law)|competency hearing]]s and the [[insanity defense]] when crimes are committed. He expresses concern that his prior equating of psychopathy with psychosis was not intended to imply that psychopaths should be automatically found not guilty. However he also expresses dissatisfaction with sending psychopaths to prison which he believes will inevitably fail to correct the behaviour due to the underlying abnormality or masked 'insanity'.\n\n==Reception and legacy==\nCleckley's work is often considered a seminal contribution to the psychiatric definition of psychopathy, and continues to act as a cornerstone to subsequent lines of research and clinical practice. The label \"psychopath\" as used by Cleckley has also been embraced by [[popular culture]], and is often applied to [[serial killer]]s and other violent criminals, irrespective of whether they qualify; for this reason the imprecise popular use had been deplored. Therefore, although in popular culture the term is common, that usage has little technical relevance to criminology, [[forensic psychology]] or [[forensic psychiatry|psychiatry]].<ref name=lust>\n{{cite book | last = Cameron | first = Deborah | authorlink =  | title = The Lust to Kill | publisher = New York University Press | location = Washington Square, NY | year = 1987 | pages = [https://archive.org/details/lusttokillfemini0000came/page/87 87\u201394] | doi =  | isbn = 0-8147-1408-0 | url = https://archive.org/details/lusttokillfemini0000came/page/87 }}</ref>\n\nHowever, [[Robert D.

Some point out that the core personality was not described by Cleckley as usually particularly hostile or aggressive, unlike in Hare's later concept.

Despite the seemingly sincere, intelligent, even charming external presentation, internally the psychopathic person does not have the ability to experience genuine emotions. Cleckley questions whether this mask of sanity is voluntarily assumed to intentionally hide the lack of internal structure, but concludes it hides a serious, but yet imprecisely unidentified, semantic neuropsychiatric defect.<ref>Cleckley, p. 238</ref> Six editions of the book were produced in total, the final shortly after his death. An expanded fifth edition of the book had been published in 1976 and was re-released by his heirs in 1988 for non-profit educational use.\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of psychopathy}}\nIn the 1800s, [[Philippe Pinel]] first used the French term ''manie sans delire'' (\"mania without delirium\") to designate those individuals engaging in deviant behavior but exhibiting no signs of a [[cognitive disorder]] such as [[hallucination]]s or [[delusion]]s. Although the meaning of the term has changed through numerous writings on the subject over time, the writing of Cleckley and his use of the label \"psychopath\" in ''The Mask of Sanity'' brought the term into popular usage.<ref name=\"meloy\"/>\n\n==Editions==\nThe first edition was published in 1941, with the subtitle then being 'An attempt to re-interpret' rather than as later 'to clarify'. Cleckley says in the preface that the book \"grew out of an old conviction which increased during several years while I sat at staff meetings in a large [[neuropsychiatric]] hospital\". He added that after commencing full-time teaching duties he found similar patients to be as prevalent in a general hospital, outpatient clinic and the community. In later editions he explains that the basic concepts presented in 1941 were based primarily on \"adult male psychopaths hospitalized in a closed institution\" for several years. Cleckley had worked for a number of years at a [[Veterans Health Administration|United States Veterans (military) Administration]] hospital, before taking up full-time teaching responsibilities at the University of Georgia School of Medicine.\n\nThe second edition published in 1950, Cleckley has described as a \"new and much larger book\", based on more diverse clinical observations, feedback and literature reviews. The third edition in 1955 he describes as having fewer changes and additions, but important clarifications to key concepts such as the hypothesis of a core semantic deficit. A fourth edition was published in 1964.\n\nA fifth edition was published in 1976 ({{ISBN|0801609852}}) and is generally considered to be the definitive culmination of Cleckley's work. The preface does not specify the changes made. Unlike the first edition it states: \"Dr. [[Corbett H. Thigpen]], my medical associate of many years, has played a major part in the development and the revision of this work.\" Cleckley also states that it could not have been written without the assistance and contributions of Thigpen's wife and his own (first), both called Louise. A sixth edition was published shortly after Cleckley's death in 1984, but is described by others as having minimal substantive changes.<ref name=Stover2008>[https://books.google.com/books?id=R-xvEzVD7CAC A Critical Analysis of the Historical and Conceptual Evolution of Psychopathy] By Andrew R. Stover. ProQuest, 2008. Chapter 4: Hervey Cleckley's The Mask of Sanity</ref> Several further years after Cleckley's death, another fifth edition ({{ISBN|0962151904}}) was released for non-profit educational use by Emily S. Cleckley, his second wife, naming her as well as Hervey M. Cleckley and copyrighted 1988 to her rather than [[Mosby (imprint)|Mosby]] as for all prior initial releases (which have been repeat published in various different years).<ref>[http://www.cassiopaea.org/cass/sanity_1.PdF The Mask of Sanity - 5th edition], 1988, \"scanned facsimile produced for non-profit educational use\"</ref>\n\n==Description==\n''The Mask of Sanity'', fifth edition, presents clinical theories as well as case studies, written in the form of dramatic, novelistic descriptions of 13 individuals, an amalgamation of those he had observed.\n\n===Initial outline===\n''The Mask of Sanity'' begins in Section One, \"An Outline of the Problem\", by considering the concept of [[sanity]], which Cleckley describes as [[protean]]. The first words of the book are a possibly untrue anecdote ending with the line, capitalized and centered in large font, \"WHO'S LOONEY NOW?\" Cleckley suggests that everyone \"behaves at times with something short of complete rationality and good judgment\". He notes that many types of people hold beliefs that he and much of society would consider irrational, such as [[mysticism]], [[pseudoscience]], praising of unintelligible or immoral works (e.g. acclaim for the novel ''[[Finnegans Wake]]'' containing only \"erudite gibberish\" or for the writing of [[Andr\u00e9 Gide]] on [[pederasty]]), and religious faith. He argues, however, that these are personal freedoms and such groups are usually capable of leading useful lives in harmony with others. This he says distinguishes it from [[psychosis]] once fully developed and from psychopathy.<ref name=Stover2008/>\n\n====Classification schemes====\nCleckley also addresses the confusing traditions of classification in the area of psychopathy, a term he admits is itself confusing and not being used in line with its [[etymological]] meaning ('mental sickness'), though adopts it as the most familiar and apparently durable. He considers the terms sociopathic personality and antisocial personality, as adopted by the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]; the relationship to the overall category of [[personality disorder]]; and the earlier widespread concept of \"constitutional psychopathic inferiority\", disputing its hereditary assumptions. He states that the main purpose of the book is to bring a few cases before other psychiatrists, and also to raise the profile among the public, to enable better management of psychopaths. He criticizes the '[[doctrine]] of [[Permissive society|permissiveness]]', and refers with regret to the lack of prominence of psychopathy in psychiatric textbooks.\n\n====Prevalence====\nCleckley argues under a subsection titled \"Not as single spies but in battalions\" (a phrase appearing in ''[[Hamlet]]''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/407600.html|title=When sorrows come, they come not single spies, but in battalions|author=Phrase Finder is copyright Gary Martin, 1996-2015. All rights reserved.|work=phrases.org.uk}}</ref>), that although reliable statistics are hard to come by, there are various reasons to suspect both psychiatric and prison admission rates are an underestimate, and the [[Incidence (epidemiology)|incidence]] of the condition is in his opinion \"exceedingly high\". He does present some statistics from a survey whereby he and nine other psychiatrists diagnosed 1/8th of patients as having psychopathic personality without any other mental disorder that might explain the condition, and considers that quite a few others classified as alcoholic or drug addicted would actually have qualified too. Their survey is further detailed in the book's appendix, where Cleckley clarifies it took place between 1937 and 1939 at a federal [[Veterans Administration]] hospital, located on the [[Southeastern United States|Southeastern]] seaboard, for the care of ex-service men, mainly from [[World War I]]. He critiques the 'benign policy' of the VA of not diagnosing more psychopathic personality due to giving the benefit of the doubt to issues such as [[neurasthenia]], [[hysteria]], [[psychasthenia]], [[Posttraumatic stress disorder|posttraumatic neuroses]], or [[cerebral trauma]] from [[skull]] injuries and [[concussions]]. He concludes they have \"records of the utmost folly and misery and idleness over many years\" and if considering the number in every community who are protected by relatives, \"the [[prevalence]] of this disorder is seen to be appalling.\"\n\n====Method====\nFinally, Cleckley asserts that the account provided in his book will accord with the [[scientific method]], as pointed out by [[Karl Pearson]] in ''[[The Grammar of Science]]'', which he loosely summarizes as: to record observed facts; group them together by correlation as distinguished from other facts; to try to summarize or explain in a way that indicates the significance. He also says his method takes inspiration from that used in an earlier work, ''The Psychology of Insanity'' by English physician [[Bernard Hart]] (first edition published in 1912 and now open access<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/psychologyofinsa00hartrich|title=The psychology of insanity|work=Internet Archive}}</ref>).\n\n===Characteristics===\nIn Section Two, \"The Material\", Cleckley presents a typical \"full\" psychopath's behavior in a series of 15 [[Vignette (literature)|vignettes]] (originally nine in the first edition, and all male). For example, the psychopath can typically tell vivid, lifelike, plausible stories that are completely fraudulent, without evincing any element of delusion. When confronted with a lie, the psychopath is unflappable and can often effortlessly pass it off as a joke. In another typical case history, the psychopath is hospitalized for psychiatric treatment but because of his constant trouble-making, leaving wards in an uproar, the hospital is finally forced to turn him over to the police. Eventually, the police become so sick of his repeated antics that they try to hospitalize him again.\n\nAlso included are six vignettes of \"Incomplete manifestations or suggestions of the disorder\" in non-patients, such as \"The businessman\", \"The gentleman\" or \"The physician\".\n\n===Differentiation===\nIn Section Three, 'Cataloging the material', Cleckley continues the conceptual outline started in Section One, now termed 'Orientation'. He criticises the tenets of [[faculty psychology]] (now known as [[modularity of mind]]), arguing that such things as intelligence, morality and emotions are not separate parts in the brain but separate concepts we apply. He believes psychopaths would have been included in the 19th century concepts of 'mania without insanity' by [[Philippe Pinel]] and Prichard's [[moral insanity]], but rejects their faculty basis. He notes the confusingly broad literal meaning and practical usage of the terms psychopathic personality or personality disorder, giving the example of the most authoritative textbook of the second quarter of the century, ''Psychopathic Personalities,'' by German psychiatrist [[Eugen Kahn]].\n\nHe rails against the [[counterculture]] [[antihero]] and gives as an example the novelist Alan Harrington<ref>https://www.nytimes.com/1997/05/28/arts/alan-harrington-79-novelist-known-for-his-black-humor.html</ref> for suggesting a socially necessary role for psychopathy in modern times, calling the idea \"perverse and degenerate\". He also criticizes [[Freud]]ian-inspired ideas about antisocial acts being caused by unconscious guilt. He also disagrees with theories of neurotic, emotional or paranoid problems in subtypes of psychopathy, as in his concept there is always a relative or complete lack of this. He says the new DSM \"personality disorder, antisocial type\" offers an accurate term equivalent to psychopathy which he thinks will also continue as a term for a long time.<ref>The Mask of Sanity, Fifth edition, pp 225 - 243</ref>\n\n====Psychosis====\nCleckley then considers how [[schizophrenia]] is different from psychopathy, having a defect in theoretical reasoning. He notes that [[schizoid]] disorders may appear more similar, and might be more accurately called \"masked schizophrenia\", which he notes can sometimes be difficult to differentiate from psychopathy. He also notes other 'disguises' of severe personality disorder, such as \"cryptic depression\" or \"pseudoneurotic schizophrenia\" or \"pseudopsychopathic schizophrenia\". He finds the diagnosis of \"psychosis with psychopathic personality\" unnecessarily confusing. He declares, \"There is little point in devoting space to detailed accounts of [[paranoid]] or [[cyclothymic]] personalities.\"\n\nIn the first edition Cleckley described his psychopathic patients as \"frankly and unquestionably psychotic\", but modified this in later editions. In the fifth edition he describes long ago changing his opinion and now agreeing with the psychiatrist [[Richard L. Jenkins]] that this would stretch the definition of psychosis too far.<ref>Mask of Sanity, fifth edition, pg 367-371, 423</ref><ref name=\"HareNeumann2008\">{{cite journal |doi=10.1146/annurev.clinpsy.3.022806.091452 |title=Psychopathy as a Clinical and Empirical Construct |year=2008 |last1=Hare |first1=Robert D. |last2=Neumann |first2=Craig S. |journal=Annual Review of Clinical Psychology |volume=4 |pages=217\u201346 |pmid=18370617|url=http://www.hare.org/references/HareandNeumannARCP2008.pdf}}</ref> However at various other points it is still suggested that, despite \"traditional\" classification, the extent of the inner abnormality and associated dysfunction in psychopathy is such that it might be considered a psychosis in many respects.<ref>The Mask of Sanity, fifth edition, pgs 339,382, 387</ref>\n\n====Criminality====\nCleckley draws important distinctions between the psychopath and non-psychopathic criminal.<ref>Cleckley, pp. 249\u2013252</ref> He states that the psychopath very seldom takes much advantage of any gain, has an obscure or inconsistent purpose, usually puts himself unnecessarily in a shameful position as much as causing trouble for others; and usually does not commit the most serious or violent crimes, but usually does end up harming himself. However, despite the general picture of weak-willed and inconsistent antisocial behavior, he also states, at least in later editions, that some may develop drives towards the most serious or sadistic crimes. He suggests this is a somewhat separate additional pathology but does not explain why or how.\n\nCleckely considers that the concept of [[wikt:delinquency|delinquency]] has much in common with his concept of psychopathy, and argues that it could be considered a mild version if it continues for a long time and is generalized. He notes that many respectable mature productive citizens can look back on short periods of unprovoked social misconduct, including such things as property damage, [[racism]], [[bestiality]], [[voyeurism]], rebellion, and [[promiscuity]]. On the other hand, he notes prolonged but prescribed behavioral disorder in the case of a woman who remained for some time \"irrationally promiscuous and [[bisexual]]\", but who had plausible psychological reasons for her behavior and was otherwise functional in her work and life. He also notes he no longer considers that [[homosexuality]] should be classed as sexual psychopathy, on the grounds that many homosexuals seem to be able to live productive lives in society. He considers that sexual [[fetishes]] are not particularly consistent with psychopaths, as the latter tend to have weak drives. However, paradoxically, he then states that psychopathy can be associated with particular [[sadistic personality disorder|sadistic]] drives and often be responsible for the most serious [[sex crime]]s.\n\n====Other conditions====\nHe distinguishes psychopaths from non-psychopathic [[alcoholics]], who by contrast have a purpose for drinking such as to avoid reality, and may want and try to change, whereas the psychopath appears to drink simply to behave outrageously and get into trouble. He also separates [[psychoneurotics]] (though accepts there may sometimes be overlap) and \"[[mental retardation|mental defectives]]\" (who unlike the psychopath will test poorly on theoretical intelligence tests as well as in behavior in life). The psychopath does not suffer from any obvious mental disorder but in the end seems to deliberately court failure and disaster for no obvious reason and despite intelligence, in what Cleckley calls a social and spiritual suicide.\n\nCleckley then considers whether psychopathy may be erratic [[genius]]. In surveying some noted literary works embodying what he describes as \"malignantly perverse attitudes\", such as by [[Paul Verlaine]], [[Dostoevski]], [[Marquis de Sade]], [[Baudelaire]] and [[Swinburne]] (some associated with the [[Decadent movement]]), he suggests that it might be a form of psychopathy, and might appeal to similarly disordered people or to \"new cults of intellectual defeatists and deviates\" such as certain [[avant garde]] groups. However he concludes that such artworks and sexual deviations are more likely due to [[schizoid]] disorder with [[misanthropy]] and life perversion, whereas the \"true psychopath\" would not labor to produce art extolling pathologic or perverse attitudes; on the contrary, they would tend to superficially proclaim belief in a normal, moral life. However, Cleckley then suggests that initial potential for greatness and emotional depth may cause problems, such as being more affected by problems in life, that then leads into psychopathy.\n\n====Fiction and ancient history====\nCleckley then surveys numerous characters in fictional works that he considers to be portrayals of psychopathy. He concludes by addressing figures in history, excluding [[Adolf Hitler]] and others from his definition but highlighting [[Alcibiades]], a [[General officer|military general]] and politician in [[Ancient Greece]]. He describes a fascination with him growing out an old conviction in the \"paradoxical\" nature of his life, since learning of it in high school. He concludes that Alcibiades \"had the gift of every talent except that of using them consistently to achieve any sensible aim or in behalf of any discernible cause\" and he \"may have been a spectacular example of...the psychopath\", that \"still inexplicable pattern of human life\".<ref>The Mask of Sanity, 5th Edition, 316-336</ref>\n\n===Profile===\nCleckley then summarizes the material and provides a 'clinical profile', describing 16 behavioral characteristics of a psychopath (reduced from 21 in the first edition):\n<ref>Cleckley, pp.338-339 (5th ed.)</ref>\n#[[Superficial charm]] and good intelligence\n#Absence of delusions and other signs of irrational thinking\n#Absence of nervousness or [[neurosis|psychoneurotic]] manifestations\n#Unreliability\n#Untruthfulness and insincerity\n#Lack of [[remorse]] and [[shame]]\n#Inadequately motivated [[antisocial behavior]]\n#Poor judgment and failure to learn by experience\n#Pathologic [[egocentricity]] and incapacity for [[love]]\n#General poverty in major affective reactions\n#Specific loss of [[Insight in psychology and psychiatry|insight]]\n#Unresponsiveness in general interpersonal relations\n#Fantastic and uninviting behavior with drink and sometimes without\n#[[Suicide]] threats rarely carried out\n#[[Human sexual behavior|Sex life]] impersonal, trivial, and poorly integrated\n#Failure to follow any life plan.\n\nSome of the criteria have obvious [[psychodynamic]] implications, such as a lack of remorse, poor judgment, failure to learn from experience, pathological egocentricity, lack of capacity for love, a general poverty in major affective reactions, and lack of insight into his own condition.<ref name=\"meloy\"/> Starting in 1972, newer editions of the book reflected a closer alliance with [[Kernberg]]'s (1984) [[borderline personality|borderline level]] of [[Personality psychology|personality]] organization, specifically defining the structural criteria of the psychopath's [[Identity (social science)|identity]] integration, [[Defence mechanism|defensive operations]] and [[reality testing]].<ref>Meloy, p. 10</ref>\n\n===Pathology and causes===\nIn Section Four, \"Some Questions Still Without Answers\", Cleckley discusses his concept of \"semantic\" dementia (used today to refer to a [[dementia|medical disorder]] unconnected to Cleckley's meaning) or, in later editions, semantic disorder or deficit. He referred to a [[hypothesized]] neurological condition which would be the underlying [[pathology]] linking together and explaining all the different personalities classed as psychopathy by Cleckley. By semantic he meant the ability to emotionally experience or understand \"the meaning of life as lived by ordinary people\". He acknowledged there was no proof or even evidence that this was the underlying condition, but believed that it helped explain the traits and behaviors he observed. As an example to explain the kind of distinction he was drawing between an ability to appear superficially normal despite a core deficit in meaning, he made an [[analogy]] to a neurological [[language disorder]] known as semantic [[aphasia]].<ref>The Mask of Sanity, fifth edition, pages 376-387</ref>\n\nCleckley concludes from his clinical experience that the cause of the disorder of psychopathy is probably not, in general, demonstrably [[psychodynamic]] or even [[Psychogenic disease|psychogenic]], although life influences may play a role in some cases and he notes the progression of the disorder can seem like a kind of social and spiritual (but not actual) suicide, or \"semi-suicide\". He suggests rather that a subtle yet profound defect at a fundamental biological level, probably [[Congenital disorder|inborn]] in some sense but not [[hereditary]] (gives the example of [[agenesis]] of the [[embryo]]) could be the main cause. He admits \"This, too, is still a speculative concept and is not supported by demonstrable evidence.\" Having called it a defect, he notes that it would be \"one that affects complex mechanisms of integration in a subtle and abstruse manner\", and as such could actually sometimes be a positive trait or ability which could nevertheless end up bringing about personal problems in society.<ref>The Mask of Sanity, 5th Edition, pp 403-415</ref>\n\n===Treatment or control===\nCleckley writes in the fifth edition that he remains, since before the first edition, profoundly struck both by the lack of response to treatment of those he classes as psychopathic, and by the legal difficulty of trying to detain them in hospital. While noting the issue of the protection of liberty, he argues that better ways must be found to do the latter for their own good and that of society, on the primary basis of demonstrated disability and need, perhaps within psychiatric units but segregated from other patients. He notes that neither psychological therapy or physical methods such as [[Electroconvulsive therapy|shock therapy]] or [[lobotomy]] appear to be a real solution to the problem, but suggests that more opportunity to control and direct the person may help psychiatrists treat them in the long-run.<ref>Mask of Sanity, Fifth edition, Pg 433-446</ref> He also considers the issue of [[Competency evaluation (law)|competency hearing]]s and the [[insanity defense]] when crimes are committed. He expresses concern that his prior equating of psychopathy with psychosis was not intended to imply that psychopaths should be automatically found not guilty. However he also expresses dissatisfaction with sending psychopaths to prison which he believes will inevitably fail to correct the behaviour due to the underlying abnormality or masked 'insanity'.\n\n==Reception and legacy==\nCleckley's work is often considered a seminal contribution to the psychiatric definition of psychopathy, and continues to act as a cornerstone to subsequent lines of research and clinical practice. The label \"psychopath\" as used by Cleckley has also been embraced by [[popular culture]], and is often applied to [[serial killer]]s and other violent criminals, irrespective of whether they qualify; for this reason the imprecise popular use had been deplored. Therefore, although in popular culture the term is common, that usage has little technical relevance to criminology, [[forensic psychology]] or [[forensic psychiatry|psychiatry]].<ref name=lust>\n{{cite book | last = Cameron | first = Deborah | authorlink =  | title = The Lust to Kill | publisher = New York University Press | location = Washington Square, NY | year = 1987 | pages = [https://archive.org/details/lusttokillfemini0000came/page/87 87\u201394] | doi =  | isbn = 0-8147-1408-0 | url = https://archive.org/details/lusttokillfemini0000came/page/87 }}</ref>\n\nHowever, [[Robert D.

Some point out that the core personality was not described by Cleckley as usually particularly hostile or aggressive, unlike in Hare's later concept.

Somewhat paradoxically, Cleckley regarded the DSM category as equivalent to his concept of psychopathy,<ref name=Stover2008/> while Hare considers his concept, which was based on Cleckley's, to be different from the DSM since the third version and to be more similar to the ICD's continuing category of \"[[Dissocial Personality Disorder]]\".

Allied forces advanced over {{convert|11|km|0}} on the first day, one of the greatest advances of the war, with Gen [[Henry Rawlinson, 1st Baron Rawlinson|Henry Rawlinson]]'s [[British Fourth Army]] (with 9 of its 19 [[Division (military)|divisions]] supplied by the fast moving [[Australian Corps]] of Lt Gen [[John Monash]] and [[Canadian Corps]] of Lt Gen [[Arthur Currie]]) playing the decisive role. The battle is also notable for its effects on both sides' morale and the large number of [[surrender (military)|surrendering]] [[German Empire|German]] forces. This led [[Erich Ludendorff]] to later describe the first day of the battle as \"'''the black day of the German Army'''\". Amiens was one of the first major battles involving [[armoured warfare]].\n\n== Prelude ==\nOn 21 March 1918, the [[German Army (German Empire)|German Army]] had launched [[Operation Michael]], the first in a [[Spring Offensive|series of attacks]] planned to drive the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]] back along the length of the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]]. After the signing of the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]] with [[Russian Revolution|revolutionary-controlled Russia]], the Germans were able to transfer hundreds of thousands of men to the Western Front, giving them a significant, if temporary, advantage in manpower and material. These offensives were intended to translate this advantage into victory. Operation Michael was intended to defeat the right wing of the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War I)|British Expeditionary Force]] (BEF), but a lack of success around [[Arras, France|Arras]] ensured the ultimate failure of the offensive. A final effort was aimed at the town of [[Amiens]], a vital railway junction, but the advance had been halted at [[First Battle of Villers-Bretonneux|Villers-Bretonneux]] by [[British Army during World War I|British]] and [[Australian Army during World War I|Australian troops]] on 4 April.<ref name=\"atlas\">{{cite book|last=Livesay|first=Anthony|title=Historical Atlas of World War I|publisher=Henry Holt and Company|location=New York|year=1994}}</ref>\n\nSubsequent German offensives\u2014[[Battle of the Lys (1918)|Operation Georgette]] (9\u201311 April), [[Operation Bl\u00fccher-Yorck]] (27 May), [[Operation Gneisenau]] (9 June) and [[Operation Marne-Rheims]] (15\u201317 July)\u2014all made advances elsewhere on the Western Front, but failed to achieve a decisive breakthrough.<ref>{{cite book|last=Paschall|first=Rod|title=The Defeat of Imperial Germany 1917\u20131918|publisher=Algonquin Books|location=Chapel Hill, North Carolina|year=1989}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Gray|first=Randal|title=Kaiserschlacht 1918 \u2013 The Final German Offensive|publisher=Grolier Educational|location=Danbury, Connecticut|year=1997}}</ref>\n\nBy the end of the Marne-Rheims offensive, the German manpower advantage had been spent and their supplies and troops were exhausted. The Allied general, General [[Ferdinand Foch]], ordered a [[Counterattack|counteroffensive]] which led to victory at the [[Second Battle of the Marne]], following which he was promoted to [[Marshal of France]]. The Germans, recognising their untenable position, withdrew from the [[Marne River|Marne]] to the north.<ref name=\"duffy\">{{cite web| last=Duffy| first=Michael| title=Second Battle of the Marne| publisher=FirstWorldWar.Com| date=17 April 2004| url= http://www.firstworldwar.com/battles/marne2.htm| accessdate=26 July 2006| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060715001052/http://www.firstworldwar.com/battles/marne2.htm| archivedate= 15 July 2006 | url-status= live}}</ref> Foch now tried to move the Allies back onto the offensive.\n\n=== Plan ===\nFoch disclosed his plan on 23 July 1918,<ref name=kearsey2>Kearsey pp. 11\u201312</ref> following the allied victory at the [[Battle of Soissons (1918)|Battle of Soissons]]. The plan called for reducing the [[Saint-Mihiel]] [[Salients, re-entrants and pockets|salient]] (which would later see combat in the [[Battle of Saint-Mihiel]]) and freeing the railway lines that ran through Amiens from German shellfire.\n\nThe commander of the British Expeditionary Force, [[Field Marshal (UK)|Field Marshal]] Sir [[Douglas Haig, 1st Earl Haig|Douglas Haig]], already had plans in place for an attack near Amiens. When the British retreat had ended in April, the headquarters of the [[Fourth Army (United Kingdom)|British Fourth Army]] under General Sir [[Henry Rawlinson, 1st Baron Rawlinson|Henry Rawlinson]] had taken over the front astride the [[Somme River|Somme]]. Its left hand corps was the [[III Corps (United Kingdom)|British III Corps]] under Lieutenant General Richard Butler, while the [[Australian Corps]] under Lieutenant General [[Sir John Monash|John Monash]] held the right flank and linked up with French armies to the south. On 30 May, all the Australian infantry divisions were united under the corps HQ, for the first time on the Western Front. The Australians had mounted a number of local counter-attacks which both revealed the suitability of the open and firm terrain south of the Somme for a larger offensive, and established and refined the methods which were to be used.<ref>Blaxland pp. 154\u2013156</ref>\n\nRawlinson had submitted Monash's proposals to Haig in July and Haig had forwarded them to Foch. At a meeting on 24 July, Foch agreed to the plan but insisted that the [[First Army (France)|French First Army]], which held the front to the south of the British Fourth Army, should participate. Rawlinson opposed this as his and Monash's plans depended on the large-scale use of tanks (now finally available in large numbers) to achieve surprise, by avoiding a preliminary bombardment. The French First Army lacked tanks and would be forced to bombard the German positions before the infantry advance began, thus removing the element of surprise. Eventually, it was agreed that the French would participate, but not launch their attack until 45 minutes after the Fourth Army.<ref name=\"atlas\" /> It was also agreed to advance the proposed date of the attack from 10 August to 8 August, to strike the Germans before they had completed their withdrawal from the Marne salient.\n\nRawlinson had already finalised his plans in discussion with his Corps commanders (Butler, Monash, [[Arthur Currie|Sir Arthur Currie]] of the [[Canadian Corps]] and Lieutenant General [[Charles Kavanagh]] of the [[Cavalry Corps (United Kingdom)|Cavalry Corps]]) on 21 July. For the first time, the Australians would attack side by side with the Canadian Corps. Both had a reputation for aggressive and innovative tactics and a strong record of success over the past two years.\n\nThe tactical methods had been tested by the Australians in a local counter-attack at the [[Battle of Hamel]] on 4 July. The German defenders of Hamel were deeply dug in, and their position commanded a very wide field of fire. Similar positions had resisted capture for two months in the [[Battle of the Somme]]. The Australians had used surprise rather than weight at Hamel. The artillery had opened fire only at the moment the infantry and tanks advanced, and the Germans were rapidly overrun.<ref>Blaxland pp. 146\u2013149</ref>\n\nA key factor in the final plan was secrecy. There was to be no artillery bombardment a significant time before the attack, as was the usual practice, only fire immediately prior to the advance of Australian, Canadian, and British forces.<ref name=kearsey2 /> The final plan for the Fourth Army involved 1,386 [[Artillery|field guns]] and [[howitzer]]s and 684 heavy guns,<ref name=\"Hart 2008 p. 311\" /> making up 27 medium artillery brigades and thirteen heavy batteries, in addition to the infantry divisions' artillery. The fire plan for the Fourth Army's artillery was devised by Monash's senior artillery officer, Major General [[Charles Budworth|C. E. D. Budworth]]. British [[sound ranging]] advances in artillery techniques and aerial photographic reconnaissance made it possible to dispense with \"ranging shots\" to ensure accurate fire. Budworth had produced a timetable which allowed 504 out of 530 German guns<ref name=\"Hart 2008 p. 311\" /> to be hit at \"zero hour\", while a creeping [[barrage (artillery)|barrage]] preceded the infantry. This method was similar to the ''Feuerwalze'' which the Germans themselves had used in their [[Spring Offensive]], but its effectiveness was increased by the surprise achieved.<ref>Blaxland p. 168</ref>\n\nThere were also to be 580 tanks. The Canadian and Australian Corps were each allocated a brigade of four battalions, with 108 [[Mark V tank|Mark V fighting tanks]], 36 [[Mark V tank#Mark V*|Mark V \"Star\"]], and 24 unarmed tanks intended to carry supplies and ammunition forward. A single battalion of Mark V tanks was allocated to III Corps. The Cavalry Corps were allocated two battalions each of 48 [[Medium Mark A Whippet]] tanks.<ref>Blaxland, p. 160</ref>\n\nThe Allies had successfully moved the Canadian Corps of four infantry divisions to Amiens without them being detected by the Germans. This was a noteworthy achievement and reflected well on the increasingly efficient staff work of the British armies. A detachment from the Corps of two infantry battalions, a wireless unit and a casualty clearing station had been sent to the front near [[Ypres]] to bluff the Germans that the entire Corps was moving north to Flanders.<ref>Blaxland p. 161</ref> The Canadian Corps was not fully in position until 7 August. To maintain secrecy, the Allied commanders pasted the notice \"Keep Your Mouth Shut\" into orders issued to the men, and referred to the action as a \"raid\" rather than an \"offensive\".<ref name=\"kearsey3\">Kearsey pp. 13\u201314</ref>\n\n=== Preliminaries ===\n[[File:The Hundred Days Offensive, August-november 1918 Q10377.jpg|thumb|300px|Men of the [[Royal Garrison Artillery]] loading a [[BL 9.2-inch howitzer|9.2 inch howitzer]] near [[Bayencourt]] just before the battle]]\n\nAlthough the Germans were still on the offensive in late July 1918, the Allied armies were growing in strength, as more American units arrived in France, and British reinforcements were transferred from the Home Army in Britain and the [[Sinai and Palestine Campaign]]. The German commanders realised in early August that their forces might be forced onto the defensive, though Amiens was not considered to be a likely front. The Germans believed the French would probably attack the Saint-Mihiel front east of [[Rheims]], or in Flanders near [[Mount Kemmel]], while they believed the British would attack along either the [[Lys river|Lys]] or near [[Albert, Somme|Albert]]. The Allies had indeed mounted a number of local counter-offensives in these sectors, both to gain local objectives to improve their defensive positions and to distract attention from the Amiens sector. German forces began to withdraw from the Lys and other fronts in response to these theories. The Allies maintained equal artillery and air fire along their various fronts, moving troops only at night, and feigning movements during the day to mask their actual intent.\n\nThe German front east of Amiens was held by their [[2nd Army (German Empire)|Second Army]] under General [[Georg von der Marwitz]], with six divisions in line (and two facing the French 1st Army). There were only two divisions in immediate reserve. There was some concern among the Allies on 6 August when the [[27th Division (German Empire)|German 27th Division]] actually attacked north of the Somme on part of the front on which the Allies planned to attack two days later. The German division (a specially selected and trained ''[[Stosstruppen]]'' formation) penetrated roughly {{convert|800|yd|m}} into the one-and-a-half mile front.<ref>Blaxland p. 164</ref> This attack was made in retaliation for a trench raid by the 5th Australian Division north of the Somme on the night of 31 July, which had taken many prisoners, before the Australian Corps was concentrated south of the river.<ref>Blaxland, p. 162</ref> The German division moved back towards its original position on the morning of 7 August, but the movement still required changes to the Allied plan.\n\nTo increase the level of surprise still further, the rumble of the approaching tanks was to be masked by bombers flying up and down the German lines.  The bombers were twin engine Handley Page O-400's whose engines were similar to the tanks.  However the 2 RAF squadrons detailed to take part decided it was too hazardous to order planes into the air in the unseasonably dense fog, and asked for volunteers.  Two volunteered from 207 Squadron, Captains Gordon Flavelle and William Peace, and both were awarded the [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United Kingdom)|Distinguished Flying Cross]].<ref>\"The Brave Young Wings\", p168, Ronald Dodds, 1980, published by Canada's Wings, Inc.

Although the two forces were within {{convert|460|m|yd}} of one another, [[Chemical warfare|gas bombardment]] was very low, as the bulk of the Allied presence was unknown to the Germans. The attack was so unexpected that German forces only began to return fire after five minutes, and even then at the positions where the Allied forces had assembled at the start of the battle and had long since left.<ref name=\"kearsey4\">Kearsey pp. 15\u201316</ref>\n\nIn the first phase, seven divisions attacked: the British [[British 18th (Eastern) Division|18th (Eastern)]] and [[British 58th (2/1st London) Division|58th (2/1st London)]], the Australian [[Australian 2nd Division (World War I)|2nd]] and [[Australian 3rd Division (World War I)|3rd]], and the Canadian [[1st Canadian Division|1st]], [[2nd Canadian Division|2nd]] and [[3rd Canadian Division|3rd]] Divisions.

[[Attack aircraft#World War I|Aircraft fire]] by the new [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] and [[armored car (military)|armoured car]] fire kept the retreating Germans from rallying.<ref name=\"british1\" />\n\nThe Canadian and Australian forces in the centre advanced quickly, pushing the line {{convert|4.8|km|abbr=on}} forward from its starting point by 11:00&nbsp;am. The speed of their advance was such that a party of German officers and some divisional staff were captured while eating breakfast.<ref name=\"kearsey4\" /> A gap {{convert|24|km|abbr=on}} long was punched in the German line south of the Somme by the end of the day. There was less success north of the river, where the British III Corps had only a single tank battalion in support, the terrain was rougher and the German incursion of 6 August had disrupted some of the preparations. Although the attackers gained their first objectives, they were held up short of the [[Chipilly]] Spur, a steep wooded ridge.\n\nThe British Fourth Army took 13,000 prisoners, and the French captured a further 3,000. Total German losses were estimated to be 30,000 on 8 August.<ref>''Chronicles of World War One, Volume II: 1917\u20131921''.

The Germans had started the war with the [[Schlieffen Plan]] before the [[Race to the Sea]] slowed movement on the Western Front and the war devolved into trench warfare. The German [[Spring Offensive]] earlier in 1918 had once again given Germany the offensive edge on the Western Front. Armoured support helped the Allies tear a hole through trench lines, weakening once impregnable trench positions: the British Third Army, with no armoured support, had almost no effect on the line, while the Fourth, with fewer than a thousand tanks, broke deep into German territory.<ref name=\"atlas\" />\n\nThe British [[war correspondent]] [[Philip Gibbs]] noted Amiens' effect on the war's tempo, saying on 27 August that, \"the enemy...is on the defensive\" and, \"the initiative of attack is so completely in our hands that we are able to strike him at many different places.\" Gibbs also credits Amiens with a shift in troop [[morale]], saying, \"the change has been greater in the minds of men than in the taking of territory. On our side the army seems to be buoyed up with the enormous hope of getting on with this business quickly\" and that, \"there is a change also in the enemy's mind. They no longer have even a dim hope of victory on this western front. All they hope for now is to defend themselves long enough to gain peace by negotiation.\"<ref name=\"gibbs\" />\n\n== References ==\n\n=== Notes ===\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n=== Books ===\n* {{cite book |last=Blaxland|first=Gregory |title=Amiens 1918 |publisher=W.H.

Allied forces advanced over {{convert|11|km|0}} on the first day, one of the greatest advances of the war, with Gen [[Henry Rawlinson, 1st Baron Rawlinson|Henry Rawlinson]]'s [[British Fourth Army]] (with 9 of its 19 [[Division (military)|divisions]] supplied by the fast moving [[Australian Corps]] of Lt Gen [[John Monash]] and [[Canadian Corps]] of Lt Gen [[Arthur Currie]]) playing the decisive role. The battle is also notable for its effects on both sides' morale and the large number of [[surrender (military)|surrendering]] [[German Empire|German]] forces. This led [[Erich Ludendorff]] to later describe the first day of the battle as \"'''the black day of the German Army'''\". Amiens was one of the first major battles involving [[armoured warfare]].\n\n== Prelude ==\nOn 21 March 1918, the [[German Army (German Empire)|German Army]] had launched [[Operation Michael]], the first in a [[Spring Offensive|series of attacks]] planned to drive the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]] back along the length of the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]]. After the signing of the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]] with [[Russian Revolution|revolutionary-controlled Russia]], the Germans were able to transfer hundreds of thousands of men to the Western Front, giving them a significant, if temporary, advantage in manpower and material. These offensives were intended to translate this advantage into victory. Operation Michael was intended to defeat the right wing of the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War I)|British Expeditionary Force]] (BEF), but a lack of success around [[Arras, France|Arras]] ensured the ultimate failure of the offensive. A final effort was aimed at the town of [[Amiens]], a vital railway junction, but the advance had been halted at [[First Battle of Villers-Bretonneux|Villers-Bretonneux]] by [[British Army during World War I|British]] and [[Australian Army during World War I|Australian troops]] on 4 April.<ref name=\"atlas\">{{cite book|last=Livesay|first=Anthony|title=Historical Atlas of World War I|publisher=Henry Holt and Company|location=New York|year=1994}}</ref>\n\nSubsequent German offensives\u2014[[Battle of the Lys (1918)|Operation Georgette]] (9\u201311 April), [[Operation Bl\u00fccher-Yorck]] (27 May), [[Operation Gneisenau]] (9 June) and [[Operation Marne-Rheims]] (15\u201317 July)\u2014all made advances elsewhere on the Western Front, but failed to achieve a decisive breakthrough.<ref>{{cite book|last=Paschall|first=Rod|title=The Defeat of Imperial Germany 1917\u20131918|publisher=Algonquin Books|location=Chapel Hill, North Carolina|year=1989}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Gray|first=Randal|title=Kaiserschlacht 1918 \u2013 The Final German Offensive|publisher=Grolier Educational|location=Danbury, Connecticut|year=1997}}</ref>\n\nBy the end of the Marne-Rheims offensive, the German manpower advantage had been spent and their supplies and troops were exhausted. The Allied general, General [[Ferdinand Foch]], ordered a [[Counterattack|counteroffensive]] which led to victory at the [[Second Battle of the Marne]], following which he was promoted to [[Marshal of France]]. The Germans, recognising their untenable position, withdrew from the [[Marne River|Marne]] to the north.<ref name=\"duffy\">{{cite web| last=Duffy| first=Michael| title=Second Battle of the Marne| publisher=FirstWorldWar.Com| date=17 April 2004| url= http://www.firstworldwar.com/battles/marne2.htm| accessdate=26 July 2006| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060715001052/http://www.firstworldwar.com/battles/marne2.htm| archivedate= 15 July 2006 | url-status= live}}</ref> Foch now tried to move the Allies back onto the offensive.\n\n=== Plan ===\nFoch disclosed his plan on 23 July 1918,<ref name=kearsey2>Kearsey pp. 11\u201312</ref> following the allied victory at the [[Battle of Soissons (1918)|Battle of Soissons]]. The plan called for reducing the [[Saint-Mihiel]] [[Salients, re-entrants and pockets|salient]] (which would later see combat in the [[Battle of Saint-Mihiel]]) and freeing the railway lines that ran through Amiens from German shellfire.\n\nThe commander of the British Expeditionary Force, [[Field Marshal (UK)|Field Marshal]] Sir [[Douglas Haig, 1st Earl Haig|Douglas Haig]], already had plans in place for an attack near Amiens. When the British retreat had ended in April, the headquarters of the [[Fourth Army (United Kingdom)|British Fourth Army]] under General Sir [[Henry Rawlinson, 1st Baron Rawlinson|Henry Rawlinson]] had taken over the front astride the [[Somme River|Somme]]. Its left hand corps was the [[III Corps (United Kingdom)|British III Corps]] under Lieutenant General Richard Butler, while the [[Australian Corps]] under Lieutenant General [[Sir John Monash|John Monash]] held the right flank and linked up with French armies to the south. On 30 May, all the Australian infantry divisions were united under the corps HQ, for the first time on the Western Front. The Australians had mounted a number of local counter-attacks which both revealed the suitability of the open and firm terrain south of the Somme for a larger offensive, and established and refined the methods which were to be used.<ref>Blaxland pp. 154\u2013156</ref>\n\nRawlinson had submitted Monash's proposals to Haig in July and Haig had forwarded them to Foch. At a meeting on 24 July, Foch agreed to the plan but insisted that the [[First Army (France)|French First Army]], which held the front to the south of the British Fourth Army, should participate. Rawlinson opposed this as his and Monash's plans depended on the large-scale use of tanks (now finally available in large numbers) to achieve surprise, by avoiding a preliminary bombardment. The French First Army lacked tanks and would be forced to bombard the German positions before the infantry advance began, thus removing the element of surprise. Eventually, it was agreed that the French would participate, but not launch their attack until 45 minutes after the Fourth Army.<ref name=\"atlas\" /> It was also agreed to advance the proposed date of the attack from 10 August to 8 August, to strike the Germans before they had completed their withdrawal from the Marne salient.\n\nRawlinson had already finalised his plans in discussion with his Corps commanders (Butler, Monash, [[Arthur Currie|Sir Arthur Currie]] of the [[Canadian Corps]] and Lieutenant General [[Charles Kavanagh]] of the [[Cavalry Corps (United Kingdom)|Cavalry Corps]]) on 21 July. For the first time, the Australians would attack side by side with the Canadian Corps. Both had a reputation for aggressive and innovative tactics and a strong record of success over the past two years.\n\nThe tactical methods had been tested by the Australians in a local counter-attack at the [[Battle of Hamel]] on 4 July. The German defenders of Hamel were deeply dug in, and their position commanded a very wide field of fire. Similar positions had resisted capture for two months in the [[Battle of the Somme]]. The Australians had used surprise rather than weight at Hamel. The artillery had opened fire only at the moment the infantry and tanks advanced, and the Germans were rapidly overrun.<ref>Blaxland pp. 146\u2013149</ref>\n\nA key factor in the final plan was secrecy. There was to be no artillery bombardment a significant time before the attack, as was the usual practice, only fire immediately prior to the advance of Australian, Canadian, and British forces.<ref name=kearsey2 /> The final plan for the Fourth Army involved 1,386 [[Artillery|field guns]] and [[howitzer]]s and 684 heavy guns,<ref name=\"Hart 2008 p. 311\" /> making up 27 medium artillery brigades and thirteen heavy batteries, in addition to the infantry divisions' artillery. The fire plan for the Fourth Army's artillery was devised by Monash's senior artillery officer, Major General [[Charles Budworth|C. E. D. Budworth]]. British [[sound ranging]] advances in artillery techniques and aerial photographic reconnaissance made it possible to dispense with \"ranging shots\" to ensure accurate fire. Budworth had produced a timetable which allowed 504 out of 530 German guns<ref name=\"Hart 2008 p. 311\" /> to be hit at \"zero hour\", while a creeping [[barrage (artillery)|barrage]] preceded the infantry. This method was similar to the ''Feuerwalze'' which the Germans themselves had used in their [[Spring Offensive]], but its effectiveness was increased by the surprise achieved.<ref>Blaxland p. 168</ref>\n\nThere were also to be 580 tanks. The Canadian and Australian Corps were each allocated a brigade of four battalions, with 108 [[Mark V tank|Mark V fighting tanks]], 36 [[Mark V tank#Mark V*|Mark V \"Star\"]], and 24 unarmed tanks intended to carry supplies and ammunition forward. A single battalion of Mark V tanks was allocated to III Corps. The Cavalry Corps were allocated two battalions each of 48 [[Medium Mark A Whippet]] tanks.<ref>Blaxland, p. 160</ref>\n\nThe Allies had successfully moved the Canadian Corps of four infantry divisions to Amiens without them being detected by the Germans. This was a noteworthy achievement and reflected well on the increasingly efficient staff work of the British armies. A detachment from the Corps of two infantry battalions, a wireless unit and a casualty clearing station had been sent to the front near [[Ypres]] to bluff the Germans that the entire Corps was moving north to Flanders.<ref>Blaxland p. 161</ref> The Canadian Corps was not fully in position until 7 August. To maintain secrecy, the Allied commanders pasted the notice \"Keep Your Mouth Shut\" into orders issued to the men, and referred to the action as a \"raid\" rather than an \"offensive\".<ref name=\"kearsey3\">Kearsey pp. 13\u201314</ref>\n\n=== Preliminaries ===\n[[File:The Hundred Days Offensive, August-november 1918 Q10377.jpg|thumb|300px|Men of the [[Royal Garrison Artillery]] loading a [[BL 9.2-inch howitzer|9.2 inch howitzer]] near [[Bayencourt]] just before the battle]]\n\nAlthough the Germans were still on the offensive in late July 1918, the Allied armies were growing in strength, as more American units arrived in France, and British reinforcements were transferred from the Home Army in Britain and the [[Sinai and Palestine Campaign]]. The German commanders realised in early August that their forces might be forced onto the defensive, though Amiens was not considered to be a likely front. The Germans believed the French would probably attack the Saint-Mihiel front east of [[Rheims]], or in Flanders near [[Mount Kemmel]], while they believed the British would attack along either the [[Lys river|Lys]] or near [[Albert, Somme|Albert]]. The Allies had indeed mounted a number of local counter-offensives in these sectors, both to gain local objectives to improve their defensive positions and to distract attention from the Amiens sector. German forces began to withdraw from the Lys and other fronts in response to these theories. The Allies maintained equal artillery and air fire along their various fronts, moving troops only at night, and feigning movements during the day to mask their actual intent.\n\nThe German front east of Amiens was held by their [[2nd Army (German Empire)|Second Army]] under General [[Georg von der Marwitz]], with six divisions in line (and two facing the French 1st Army). There were only two divisions in immediate reserve. There was some concern among the Allies on 6 August when the [[27th Division (German Empire)|German 27th Division]] actually attacked north of the Somme on part of the front on which the Allies planned to attack two days later. The German division (a specially selected and trained ''[[Stosstruppen]]'' formation) penetrated roughly {{convert|800|yd|m}} into the one-and-a-half mile front.<ref>Blaxland p. 164</ref> This attack was made in retaliation for a trench raid by the 5th Australian Division north of the Somme on the night of 31 July, which had taken many prisoners, before the Australian Corps was concentrated south of the river.<ref>Blaxland, p. 162</ref> The German division moved back towards its original position on the morning of 7 August, but the movement still required changes to the Allied plan.\n\nTo increase the level of surprise still further, the rumble of the approaching tanks was to be masked by bombers flying up and down the German lines.  The bombers were twin engine Handley Page O-400's whose engines were similar to the tanks.  However the 2 RAF squadrons detailed to take part decided it was too hazardous to order planes into the air in the unseasonably dense fog, and asked for volunteers.  Two volunteered from 207 Squadron, Captains Gordon Flavelle and William Peace, and both were awarded the [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United Kingdom)|Distinguished Flying Cross]].<ref>\"The Brave Young Wings\", p168, Ronald Dodds, 1980, published by Canada's Wings, Inc.

The French 1st Army under General Debeney opened its preliminary bombardment at the same time, and began its advance 45 minutes later, supported by a battalion of 72 [[Whippet Mk A|Whippet tanks]].<ref name=\"atlas\" /> Although German forces were on the alert, this was largely in anticipation of possible retaliation for their incursion on the sixth<ref name=\"kearsey5\">Kearsey pp. 17\u201318</ref> and not because they had learned of the preplanned Allied attack. Although the two forces were within {{convert|460|m|yd}} of one another, [[Chemical warfare|gas bombardment]] was very low, as the bulk of the Allied presence was unknown to the Germans. The attack was so unexpected that German forces only began to return fire after five minutes, and even then at the positions where the Allied forces had assembled at the start of the battle and had long since left.<ref name=\"kearsey4\">Kearsey pp. 15\u201316</ref>\n\nIn the first phase, seven divisions attacked: the British [[British 18th (Eastern) Division|18th (Eastern)]] and [[British 58th (2/1st London) Division|58th (2/1st London)]], the Australian [[Australian 2nd Division (World War I)|2nd]] and [[Australian 3rd Division (World War I)|3rd]], and the Canadian [[1st Canadian Division|1st]], [[2nd Canadian Division|2nd]] and [[3rd Canadian Division|3rd]] Divisions. Parts of the American 33rd Division supported the British attackers north of the Somme.\n\nThe attackers captured the first German position, advancing about {{convert|3.7|km|yd mi|abbr=on}} by about 7:30&nbsp;am.<ref name=\"british1\" /> In the centre, supporting units following the leading divisions attacked the second objective a further {{convert|3.2|km|abbr=on}} distant. Australian units reached their first objectives by 7:10&nbsp;am, and by 8:20&nbsp;am, the Australian [[4th Division (Australia)|4th]] and [[5th Division (Australia)|5th Divisions]] and the Canadian [[4th Canadian Division|4th]] Division passed through the initial breach in the German lines.<ref name=\"british1\" /> The third phase of the attack was assigned to infantry-carrying [[Mark V (tank)#Mark V*|Mark V*]] tanks; however, the infantry was able to carry out this final step unaided.<ref name=\"british1\" /> The Allies penetrated well to the rear of the German defences and cavalry now continued the advance, one [[brigade]] in the Australian sector and two cavalry divisions in the Canadian sector. [[Attack aircraft#World War I|Aircraft fire]] by the new [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] and [[armored car (military)|armoured car]] fire kept the retreating Germans from rallying.<ref name=\"british1\" />\n\nThe Canadian and Australian forces in the centre advanced quickly, pushing the line {{convert|4.8|km|abbr=on}} forward from its starting point by 11:00&nbsp;am. The speed of their advance was such that a party of German officers and some divisional staff were captured while eating breakfast.<ref name=\"kearsey4\" /> A gap {{convert|24|km|abbr=on}} long was punched in the German line south of the Somme by the end of the day. There was less success north of the river, where the British III Corps had only a single tank battalion in support, the terrain was rougher and the German incursion of 6 August had disrupted some of the preparations. Although the attackers gained their first objectives, they were held up short of the [[Chipilly]] Spur, a steep wooded ridge.\n\nThe British Fourth Army took 13,000 prisoners, and the French captured a further 3,000. Total German losses were estimated to be 30,000 on 8 August.<ref>''Chronicles of World War One, Volume II: 1917\u20131921''.

Horne, National Alumni 1923.</ref> Even with the lessened armour the British drove {{convert|19|km|abbr=on}} into German positions by 13 August.<ref name=kearsey2 />\n\nField Marshal Haig refused the request of Marshal Foch to continue the offensive, preferring instead to launch a [[Second Battle of the Somme|fresh offensive]] by Byng's Third Army between the Ancre and Scarpe.<ref>Hart 2008 p. 364</ref>\n\n== Aftermath ==\n[[File:Capturedgermanartillery.JPG|thumb|280px|A German [[7.7 cm FK 96 n.A.]] field gun captured during the course of the battle by the [[33rd Battalion (Australia)|33rd Australian Battalion]]]]\n\nThe Battle of Amiens was a major turning point in the tempo of the war. The Germans had started the war with the [[Schlieffen Plan]] before the [[Race to the Sea]] slowed movement on the Western Front and the war devolved into trench warfare. The German [[Spring Offensive]] earlier in 1918 had once again given Germany the offensive edge on the Western Front. Armoured support helped the Allies tear a hole through trench lines, weakening once impregnable trench positions: the British Third Army, with no armoured support, had almost no effect on the line, while the Fourth, with fewer than a thousand tanks, broke deep into German territory.<ref name=\"atlas\" />\n\nThe British [[war correspondent]] [[Philip Gibbs]] noted Amiens' effect on the war's tempo, saying on 27 August that, \"the enemy...is on the defensive\" and, \"the initiative of attack is so completely in our hands that we are able to strike him at many different places.\" Gibbs also credits Amiens with a shift in troop [[morale]], saying, \"the change has been greater in the minds of men than in the taking of territory. On our side the army seems to be buoyed up with the enormous hope of getting on with this business quickly\" and that, \"there is a change also in the enemy's mind. They no longer have even a dim hope of victory on this western front. All they hope for now is to defend themselves long enough to gain peace by negotiation.\"<ref name=\"gibbs\" />\n\n== References ==\n\n=== Notes ===\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n=== Books ===\n* {{cite book |last=Blaxland|first=Gregory |title=Amiens 1918 |publisher=W.H.

Dost Mohammad accompanied his elder brother and then Prime Minister of Kabul Wazir Fateh Khan to the [[Battle of Attock]] against the invading [[Sikh Empire|Sikhs]]. Mahmud Shah repaid Fateh Khan's services by having him assassinated in 1818, thus incurring the enmity of his tribe. After a bloody conflict, Mahmud Shah was deprived of all his possessions but [[Herat]], the rest of his dominions being divided among Fateh Khan's brothers. Of these, Dost Mohammad received [[Ghazni]], to which in 1826 he added [[Kabul]], the richest of the Afghan provinces.<ref name=\"EB1911\">{{EB1911|inline=1|wstitle=Dost Mahommed Khan|volume=8|page=438}}</ref>\n\nFrom the commencement of his reign he found himself involved in disputes with [[Ranjit Singh]], the Sikh ruler of the [[Punjab region]], who used the dethroned [[Sadozai (Pastun tribe)|Sadozai]] prince, [[Shah Shujah Durrani]], as his instrument. In 1834 Shah Shujah made a last attempt to recover his kingdom. He was defeated by Dost Mohammad Khan under the walls of [[Kandahar]], but Ranjit Singh seized the opportunity to annex [[Peshawar]]. Dost Mohammad sent his son [[Wazir Akbar Khan|Akbar Khan]] to defeat the Sikhs at the [[Battle of Jamrud]] in 1837.<ref name=\"Adamec\"/> The non- recovery of the [[Jamrud Fort]] became the Afghan Amir's worst concern.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n\n== European influence in Afghanistan ==\n{{Main|European influence in Afghanistan}}\nAt the intersection of British, Russian and, to a lesser degree, French imperial interests, political maneuvering was necessary. Rejecting overtures from [[Russian Empire|Russia]], he endeavoured to form an alliance with Great Britain, and welcomed [[Alexander Burnes]] to Kabul in 1837. Burnes, however, was unable to prevail on the governor-general, [[George Eden, 1st Earl of Auckland|Lord Auckland]], to respond to the emir's advances. Dost Mohammad was enjoined to abandon the attempt to recover Peshawar, and to place his foreign policy under British guidance. He replied by renewing his relations with Russia, and in 1838 Lord Auckland set the British troops in motion against him.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>  To enable such an action, the British manufactured the evidence needed to justify the overthrow of the Afghan ruler.{{Citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n\n== Captivity ==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2018}}\nIn 1835, Dost Mohammad Khan, the youngest and the most energetic of the Barakzai brothers, who had supplanted the Durrani dynasty and become Emir (lord, chief or king) of Kabul in 1825, advanced up to Khaibar Pass threatening to recover Peshawar. In 1836 Hari Singh Nalva, the Sikh general who along with Prince Nau Nihal Singh was guarding that frontier, built a chain of forts, including one at Jamrud at the eastern end of the [[Khyber Pass]] to defend the pass. Dost Muhammad erected a fort at `Ali Masjid at the other end. In the beginning of 1837, as Prince Nau Nihal Singh returned to Lahore to get married and the Maharaja and his court got busy with preparations for the wedding.\n\nDost Muhammad Khan sent a 25,000 strong force, including a large number of local irregulars and equipped with 18 heavy guns, to invest Jam rud. The Sikh garrison there had only 600 men and a few light artillery pieces. The Afghans besieged the fort and cut off its water supply, while a detachment was sent to the neighbouring Sikh fort of Shabqadar to prevent any help from that direction. [[Mahan Singh Mirpuri]], the garrison commander of Jamrud, kept the invaders at bay for four days and managed meanwhile to send a desperate appeal for help to Hari Singh Nalva at Peshawar. Nalva rose from his sick bed and rushed to Jamrud.\n\nIn the final battle fought on 30 April 1837, the Afghans were driven off, but Hari Singh Nalva was mortally wounded. In 1838, the Sikh monarch became a party to the Tripartite Treaty, as a result of which Shah Shuja` was reinstalled on the throne of Kabul in August 1839 with British help. Dost Muhammad Khan was exiled to [[Mussoorie]]  in November 1839, but was restored to his former position after the murder of Shah Shuja` in April 1842. He thereafter maintained cordial relations with the Lahore Darbar. The second Anglo Sikh war reawakened Dost Muhammad's ambition to seize Peshawar and the trans Indus territories, although overtly he sympathized with the Sikhs and even hired out an irregular Afghan contingent of 1,500 horses to Chatar Singh, leader of Sikh resistance against the British.\n\n== Second reign ==\n[[File:D\u014dst Mo\u1e25ammad Family WDL11464 (cropped).png|thumb|D\u014dst Mo\u1e25ammad Khan seated slightly to the right of center in this photograph.

On his return from British India, Dost Mohammad was received in triumph at Kabul, and set himself to re-establish his authorit lovely bones my guy I love him y on a firm basis. From 1846 he renewed his policy of hostility to the British and allied himself with the Sikhs. However, after the defeat of his allies at [[Gujrat city|Gujrat]] on 21 February 1849, he abandoned his designs and led his troops back into Afghanistan. In 1850 he conquered [[Balkh]],<ref name=\"WDL\">{{cite web |url = http://www.wdl.org/en/item/11748/ |title = Persia, Arabia, etc. |website = [[World Digital Library]] |year = 1852 |accessdate = 2013-07-27 }}</ref> and in 1854 he acquired control over the southern Afghan tribes by the capture of Kandahar.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n\nOn 30 March 1855, Dost Mohammad reversed his former policy by concluding an offensive and defensive alliance with the British government, signed by Sir [[Henry Montgomery Lawrence|Henry Lawrence]], Chief Commissioner of the Punjab, first proposed by [[Herbert Benjamin Edwardes|Herbert Edwardes]].<ref>{{cite DNB|wstitle=Edwardes, Herbert Benjamin|volume=17}}</ref> In 1857 he declared war on [[Qajar dynasty|Persia]] in conjunction with the British, and in July a treaty was concluded by which the province of Herat was placed under a Barakzai prince. During the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]], Dost Mohammad refrained from assisting the insurgents. His later years were disturbed by troubles at Herat and in [[Bukhara]]. These he composed for a time, but in 1862 a Persian army, acting in concert with Ahmad Khan, advanced against Herat. The old amir called the British to his aid, and, putting himself at the head of his warriors, drove the enemy from his frontiers. On 26 May 1863 he re-captured Herat, but on the 9th of June he died suddenly in the midst of victory, after playing a great role in the history of South and Central Asia for forty years. He named as his successor his son, [[Sher Ali Khan]].<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n\n==Quotations==\n{{Quote|\"We have men and we have rocks in plenty, but we have nothing else\"<ref>The sentence is quoted in the 1867 report by [[John Lawrence, 1st Baron Lawrence|John Lawrence]] known as \"[https://books.google.ch/books?id=P8lk3JtMBv0C&pg=PA226&lpg=PA226&dq=%22The+Lawrence+Minute.+1867%22&source=bl&ots=yxZjJjPrtY&sig=SSwvQxlZt9qbm5i-tVBxg-Q3tjU&hl=it&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjW3oPSo53VAhVrIsAKHajFBI8Q6AEIKzAB#v=onepage&q=%22The%20Lawrence%20Minute.%201867%22&f=false The Lawrence Minute]\".

Dost Mohammad accompanied his elder brother and then Prime Minister of Kabul Wazir Fateh Khan to the [[Battle of Attock]] against the invading [[Sikh Empire|Sikhs]]. Mahmud Shah repaid Fateh Khan's services by having him assassinated in 1818, thus incurring the enmity of his tribe. After a bloody conflict, Mahmud Shah was deprived of all his possessions but [[Herat]], the rest of his dominions being divided among Fateh Khan's brothers. Of these, Dost Mohammad received [[Ghazni]], to which in 1826 he added [[Kabul]], the richest of the Afghan provinces.<ref name=\"EB1911\">{{EB1911|inline=1|wstitle=Dost Mahommed Khan|volume=8|page=438}}</ref>\n\nFrom the commencement of his reign he found himself involved in disputes with [[Ranjit Singh]], the Sikh ruler of the [[Punjab region]], who used the dethroned [[Sadozai (Pastun tribe)|Sadozai]] prince, [[Shah Shujah Durrani]], as his instrument. In 1834 Shah Shujah made a last attempt to recover his kingdom. He was defeated by Dost Mohammad Khan under the walls of [[Kandahar]], but Ranjit Singh seized the opportunity to annex [[Peshawar]]. Dost Mohammad sent his son [[Wazir Akbar Khan|Akbar Khan]] to defeat the Sikhs at the [[Battle of Jamrud]] in 1837.<ref name=\"Adamec\"/> The non- recovery of the [[Jamrud Fort]] became the Afghan Amir's worst concern.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n\n== European influence in Afghanistan ==\n{{Main|European influence in Afghanistan}}\nAt the intersection of British, Russian and, to a lesser degree, French imperial interests, political maneuvering was necessary. Rejecting overtures from [[Russian Empire|Russia]], he endeavoured to form an alliance with Great Britain, and welcomed [[Alexander Burnes]] to Kabul in 1837. Burnes, however, was unable to prevail on the governor-general, [[George Eden, 1st Earl of Auckland|Lord Auckland]], to respond to the emir's advances. Dost Mohammad was enjoined to abandon the attempt to recover Peshawar, and to place his foreign policy under British guidance. He replied by renewing his relations with Russia, and in 1838 Lord Auckland set the British troops in motion against him.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>  To enable such an action, the British manufactured the evidence needed to justify the overthrow of the Afghan ruler.{{Citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n\n== Captivity ==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2018}}\nIn 1835, Dost Mohammad Khan, the youngest and the most energetic of the Barakzai brothers, who had supplanted the Durrani dynasty and become Emir (lord, chief or king) of Kabul in 1825, advanced up to Khaibar Pass threatening to recover Peshawar. In 1836 Hari Singh Nalva, the Sikh general who along with Prince Nau Nihal Singh was guarding that frontier, built a chain of forts, including one at Jamrud at the eastern end of the [[Khyber Pass]] to defend the pass. Dost Muhammad erected a fort at `Ali Masjid at the other end. In the beginning of 1837, as Prince Nau Nihal Singh returned to Lahore to get married and the Maharaja and his court got busy with preparations for the wedding.\n\nDost Muhammad Khan sent a 25,000 strong force, including a large number of local irregulars and equipped with 18 heavy guns, to invest Jam rud. The Sikh garrison there had only 600 men and a few light artillery pieces. The Afghans besieged the fort and cut off its water supply, while a detachment was sent to the neighbouring Sikh fort of Shabqadar to prevent any help from that direction. [[Mahan Singh Mirpuri]], the garrison commander of Jamrud, kept the invaders at bay for four days and managed meanwhile to send a desperate appeal for help to Hari Singh Nalva at Peshawar. Nalva rose from his sick bed and rushed to Jamrud.\n\nIn the final battle fought on 30 April 1837, the Afghans were driven off, but Hari Singh Nalva was mortally wounded. In 1838, the Sikh monarch became a party to the Tripartite Treaty, as a result of which Shah Shuja` was reinstalled on the throne of Kabul in August 1839 with British help. Dost Muhammad Khan was exiled to [[Mussoorie]]  in November 1839, but was restored to his former position after the murder of Shah Shuja` in April 1842. He thereafter maintained cordial relations with the Lahore Darbar. The second Anglo Sikh war reawakened Dost Muhammad's ambition to seize Peshawar and the trans Indus territories, although overtly he sympathized with the Sikhs and even hired out an irregular Afghan contingent of 1,500 horses to Chatar Singh, leader of Sikh resistance against the British.\n\n== Second reign ==\n[[File:D\u014dst Mo\u1e25ammad Family WDL11464 (cropped).png|thumb|D\u014dst Mo\u1e25ammad Khan seated slightly to the right of center in this photograph.

On his return from British India, Dost Mohammad was received in triumph at Kabul, and set himself to re-establish his authority on a firm basis. From 1846 he renewed his policy of hostility to the British and allied himself with the Sikhs. However, after the defeat of his allies at [[Gujrat city|Gujrat]] on 21 February 1849, he abandoned his designs and led his troops back into Afghanistan. In 1850 he conquered [[Balkh]],<ref name=\"WDL\">{{cite web |url = http://www.wdl.org/en/item/11748/ |title = Persia, Arabia, etc. |website = [[World Digital Library]] |year = 1852 |accessdate = 2013-07-27 }}</ref> and in 1854 he acquired control over the southern Afghan tribes by the capture of Kandahar.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n\nOn 30 March 1855, Dost Mohammad reversed his former policy by concluding an offensive and defensive alliance with the British government, signed by Sir [[Henry Montgomery Lawrence|Henry Lawrence]], Chief Commissioner of the Punjab, first proposed by [[Herbert Benjamin Edwardes|Herbert Edwardes]].<ref>{{cite DNB|wstitle=Edwardes, Herbert Benjamin|volume=17}}</ref> In 1857 he declared war on [[Qajar dynasty|Persia]] in conjunction with the British, and in July a treaty was concluded by which the province of Herat was placed under a Barakzai prince. During the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]], Dost Mohammad refrained from assisting the insurgents. His later years were disturbed by troubles at Herat and in [[Bukhara]]. These he composed for a time, but in 1862 a Persian army, acting in concert with Ahmad Khan, advanced against Herat. The old amir called the British to his aid, and, putting himself at the head of his warriors, drove the enemy from his frontiers. On 26 May 1863 he re-captured Herat, but on the 9th of June he died suddenly in the midst of victory, after playing a great role in the history of South and Central Asia for forty years. He named as his successor his son, [[Sher Ali Khan]].<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n\n==Quotations==\n{{Quote|\"We have men and we have rocks in plenty, but we have nothing else\"<ref>The sentence is quoted in the 1867 report by [[John Lawrence, 1st Baron Lawrence|John Lawrence]] known as \"[https://books.google.ch/books?id=P8lk3JtMBv0C&pg=PA226&lpg=PA226&dq=%22The+Lawrence+Minute.+1867%22&source=bl&ots=yxZjJjPrtY&sig=SSwvQxlZt9qbm5i-tVBxg-Q3tjU&hl=it&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjW3oPSo53VAhVrIsAKHajFBI8Q6AEIKzAB#v=onepage&q=%22The%20Lawrence%20Minute.%201867%22&f=false The Lawrence Minute]\".

The road runs {{convert|51.79|mi|km}} from [[Interstate&nbsp;97]] (I-97) and [[Maryland Route 3|MD&nbsp;3]] in [[Millersville, Maryland|Millersville]] west and north to Washington Road in [[Westminster, Maryland|Westminster]]. The east&ndash;west portion of MD&nbsp;32 is the '''Patuxent Freeway''', a four- to six-lane freeway between I-97 and [[Maryland Route 108|MD&nbsp;108]] in [[Clarksville, Maryland|Clarksville]]. The freeway passes through [[Odenton, Maryland|Odenton]] and [[Fort Meade, Maryland|Fort Meade]], the site of [[Fort George G. Meade]] and the [[National Security Agency]] (NSA), in western [[Anne Arundel County, Maryland|Anne Arundel County]] and along the southern part of [[Columbia, Maryland|Columbia]] in [[Howard County, Maryland|Howard County]]. Via I-97, MD&nbsp;32 connects those communities with [[U.S. Route 50 in Maryland|U.S.&nbsp;Route&nbsp;50]] (US&nbsp;50) and [[U.S. Route 301 in Maryland|US&nbsp;301]] in [[Annapolis, Maryland|Annapolis]]. The state highway also intersects the four primary highways connecting [[Baltimore, Maryland|Baltimore]] and [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]]: the [[Baltimore&ndash;Washington Parkway]], [[U.S. Route 1 in Maryland|US&nbsp;1]], [[Interstate 95 in Maryland|I-95]], and [[U.S. Route 29 in Maryland|US&nbsp;29]]. MD 32's north&ndash;south section, Sykesville Road, connects Clarksville and Westminster by way of [[Sykesville, Maryland|Sykesville]] and [[Eldersburg, Maryland|Eldersburg]] in southern [[Carroll County, Maryland|Carroll County]].\n\nMD&nbsp;32 was constructed as the original state road from [[West Friendship, Maryland|West Friendship]] north to Westminster and from Westminster west to [[Taneytown, Maryland|Taneytown]] in the early 1910s. The state highway was extended northwest to the [[Pennsylvania]] state line near [[Emmitsburg, Maryland|Emmitsburg]] in the late 1910s. The portion of MD&nbsp;32 from [[Glenelg, Maryland|Glenelg]] to US&nbsp;1 in [[Savage, Maryland|Savage]] was built as MD&nbsp;106 in the 1920s and early 1930s. MD&nbsp;32 was extended south from West Friendship and assumed all of MD&nbsp;106 in the mid-1940s. In the mid-1950s, the section of MD&nbsp;32 from Westminster west to Emmitsburg was renumbered as an extension of [[Maryland Route 97|MD&nbsp;97]]. MD 32 would later be restored to its old route through Westminster and west toward Taneytown when MD&nbsp;97, which is now [[Maryland Route 140|MD&nbsp;140]] west of Westminster, was relocated in the early 1960s. MD&nbsp;32 was truncated to Westminster in the late 1970s and rolled back to its present northern terminus in 2001.\n\nAlong its present course, MD&nbsp;32 bypassed Sykesville and was relocated from Clarksville to Glenelg in the early 1960s. The state highway was also extended east from Savage to Fort Meade in the late 1960s. A disjoint segment of MD&nbsp;32 was constructed on a new alignment from [[Maryland Route 175|MD&nbsp;175]] in Odenton to [[Maryland Route 178|MD&nbsp;178]] in [[Crownsville, Maryland|Crownsville]] in the early 1970s. The Patuxent Freeway was built from Fort Meade to Columbia in the mid-1980s and from Fort Meade to Millersville in the late 1980s and early 1990s. The freeway was completed from Columbia to Clarksville in the mid-1990s and through Fort George G. Meade in 2005. Future plans call for MD&nbsp;32 to be upgraded to a freeway from Clarksville to West Friendship.\n\n==Route description==\nMD&nbsp;32 is maintained by the [[Maryland State Highway Administration]] (MDSHA) for its entire length except for the section between Samford Road and Canine Road in Fort Meade, which is maintained by the [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. government]].

The girder system was topped by a concrete slab deck and underlain with standard concrete abutments and piers and steel bearing pads on which the aluminum girders rested. These bridges, which were designed by [[Fairchild Aircraft|Fairchild Engine and Airplane Company]], were constructed of aluminum due to that metal's light weight but similar strength compared to steel. Many experimental aluminum bridges were built due to a severe shortage of steel in the early 1960s.

Also in 1989, construction began on MD&nbsp;32 between the Baltimore&ndash;Washington Parkway and I-97. MD&nbsp;32 was extended as a four-lane divided highway along the existing road from the parkway east to MD&nbsp;198 and as a two-lane road on a new alignment from MD&nbsp;198 to MD&nbsp;175. The sections of MD&nbsp;32 from MD&nbsp;198 to MD&nbsp;175 west of Odenton and from Burns Crossing Road to I-97 were under construction to expand them to a freeway; the freeway segment from MD&nbsp;175 to Burns Crossing Road on the north side of Odenton was also under construction.<ref name=\"1989 map\"/> The freeway between MD&nbsp;198 and MD&nbsp;175 was complete by 1991.<ref name=\"1991 map\"/> The remainder of the Patuxent Freeway from Fort Meade to Millersville was completed in 1993.<ref name=\"1993 map\"/>\n\nIn 2000, construction began on the gap in the Patuxent Freeway through Fort George G.

The road runs {{convert|51.79|mi|km}} from [[Interstate&nbsp;97]] (I-97) and [[Maryland Route 3|MD&nbsp;3]] in [[Millersville, Maryland|Millersville]] west and north to Washington Road in [[Westminster, Maryland|Westminster]]. The east&ndash;west portion of MD&nbsp;32 is the '''Patuxent Freeway''', a four- to six-lane freeway between I-97 and [[Maryland Route 108|MD&nbsp;108]] in [[Clarksville, Maryland|Clarksville]]. The freeway passes through [[Odenton, Maryland|Odenton]] and [[Fort Meade, Maryland|Fort Meade]], the site of [[Fort George G. Meade]] and the [[National Security Agency]] (NSA), in western [[Anne Arundel County, Maryland|Anne Arundel County]] and along the southern part of [[Columbia, Maryland|Columbia]] in [[Howard County, Maryland|Howard County]]. Via I-97, MD&nbsp;32 connects those communities with [[U.S. Route 50 in Maryland|U.S.&nbsp;Route&nbsp;50]] (US&nbsp;50) and [[U.S. Route 301 in Maryland|US&nbsp;301]] in [[Annapolis, Maryland|Annapolis]]. The state highway also intersects the four primary highways connecting [[Baltimore, Maryland|Baltimore]] and [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]]: the [[Baltimore&ndash;Washington Parkway]], [[U.S. Route 1 in Maryland|US&nbsp;1]], [[Interstate 95 in Maryland|I-95]], and [[U.S. Route 29 in Maryland|US&nbsp;29]]. MD 32's north&ndash;south section, Sykesville Road, connects Clarksville and Westminster by way of [[Sykesville, Maryland|Sykesville]] and [[Eldersburg, Maryland|Eldersburg]] in southern [[Carroll County, Maryland|Carroll County]].\n\nMD&nbsp;32 was constructed as the original state road from [[West Friendship, Maryland|West Friendship]] north to Westminster and from Westminster west to [[Taneytown, Maryland|Taneytown]] in the early 1910s. The state highway was extended northwest to the [[Pennsylvania]] state line near [[Emmitsburg, Maryland|Emmitsburg]] in the late 1910s. The portion of MD&nbsp;32 from [[Glenelg, Maryland|Glenelg]] to US&nbsp;1 in [[Savage, Maryland|Savage]] was built as MD&nbsp;106 in the 1920s and early 1930s. MD&nbsp;32 was extended south from West Friendship and assumed all of MD&nbsp;106 in the mid-1940s. In the mid-1950s, the section of MD&nbsp;32 from Westminster west to Emmitsburg was renumbered as an extension of [[Maryland Route 97|MD&nbsp;97]]. MD 32 would later be restored to its old route through Westminster and west toward Taneytown when MD&nbsp;97, which is now [[Maryland Route 140|MD&nbsp;140]] west of Westminster, was relocated in the early 1960s. MD&nbsp;32 was truncated to Westminster in the late 1970s and rolled back to its present northern terminus in 2001.\n\nAlong its present course, MD&nbsp;32 bypassed Sykesville and was relocated from Clarksville to Glenelg in the early 1960s. The state highway was also extended east from Savage to Fort Meade in the late 1960s. A disjoint segment of MD&nbsp;32 was constructed on a new alignment from [[Maryland Route 175|MD&nbsp;175]] in Odenton to [[Maryland Route 178|MD&nbsp;178]] in [[Crownsville, Maryland|Crownsville]] in the early 1970s. The Patuxent Freeway was built from Fort Meade to Columbia in the mid-1980s and from Fort Meade to Millersville in the late 1980s and early 1990s. The freeway was completed from Columbia to Clarksville in the mid-1990s and through Fort George G. Meade in 2005. Future plans call for MD&nbsp;32 to be upgraded to a freeway from Clarksville to West Friendship.\n\n==Route description==\nMD&nbsp;32 is maintained by the [[Maryland State Highway Administration]] (MDSHA) for its entire length except for the section between Samford Road and Canine Road in Fort Meade, which is maintained by the [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. government]].

The girder system was topped by a concrete slab deck and underlain with standard concrete abutments and piers and steel bearing pads on which the aluminum girders rested. These bridges, which were designed by [[Fairchild Aircraft|Fairchild Engine and Airplane Company]], were constructed of aluminum due to that metal's light weight but similar strength compared to steel. Many experimental aluminum bridges were built due to a severe shortage of steel in the early 1960s.

Also in 1989, construction began on MD&nbsp;32 between the Baltimore&ndash;Washington Parkway and I-97. MD&nbsp;32 was extended as a four-lane divided highway along the existing road from the parkway east to MD&nbsp;198 and as a two-lane road on a new alignment from MD&nbsp;198 to MD&nbsp;175. The sections of MD&nbsp;32 from MD&nbsp;198 to MD&nbsp;175 west of Odenton and from Burns Crossing Road to I-97 were under construction to expand them to a freeway; the freeway segment from MD&nbsp;175 to Burns Crossing Road on the north side of Odenton was also under construction.<ref name=\"1989 map\"/> The freeway between MD&nbsp;198 and MD&nbsp;175 was complete by 1991.<ref name=\"1991 map\"/> The remainder of the Patuxent Freeway from Fort Meade to Millersville was completed in 1993.<ref name=\"1993 map\"/>\n\nIn 2000, construction began on the gap in the Patuxent Freeway through Fort George G.
