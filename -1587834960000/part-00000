Living in [[Bohusl\u00e4n|Bohus]], Sweden,  the family started playing golf at nearby Lyseg\u00e5rden Golf Club, but soon switched to Gullbringa Golf & Country Club, the same club as six years younger [[Helen Alfredsson]] started her career.

In order to determine whether post-exposure prophylaxis is indicated, an evaluation visit will be conducted to consider risk factors associated with developing [[HIV]]. Assessments at this visit will include whether the at-risk person or the potential source-person are [[HIV positive]], details around the potential HIV exposure event, including timing and circumstances, whether other high-risk events have occurred in the past, testing for [[sexually transmitted diseases]], testing for [[hepatitis B]] and [[Hepatitis C|C]] (nPEP is also effective against [[hepatitis B]]), and pregnancy tests for women of childbearing potential.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nRisk factors for developing HIV includes exposure of [[mucous membranes]] (vagina, rectum, eye, mouth, broken skin or under the skin) of an HIV-negative person to [[bodily fluids]] (blood, semen, rectal secretions, vaginal secretions, breast milk) of a person known to be [[HIV positive]]. For example, having [[unprotected sex]] with [[HIV positive]] partner is considered risky, but sharing sex toys, spitting and biting considered to be negligible risks for initiating post-exposure prophylaxis. The highest non-sexual risk is [[blood transfusion]] and the highest sexual contact risk is receptive anal intercourse. The timing of exposure does not affect the risk of developing HIV, but it does alter whether post-exposure prophylaxis will be recommended. Exposures that occurred 72 hours or less to beginning treatment are eligible for post-exposure prophylaxis. If the exposure occurred over 73 hours prior to treatment initiation, post-exposure prophylaxis is not indicated.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Testing ===\n'''Initial HIV testing:''' Before initiating PEP after potential [[HIV]] exposure, persons should be tested for [[HIV1]] and [[HIV2]] antigens and antibodies in the blood using a [[rapid diagnostic test]]. PEP should only be started if rapid diagnostic test reveals no HIV infection present or if tests results are not available.  However, if HIV infection is already present then PEP should not be started. HIV test should be repeated four to six weeks and three months after exposure.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nPeople may experience signs and symptoms of [[acute HIV infection]], including fever, fatigue, myalgia, and skin rash, while taking PEP. CDC recommends seeking medical attention for evaluation if these signs and symptoms occur during or after the month of PEP.  If follow-up laboratory antibody tests reveal HIV infection, HIV treatment specialists should be sought out and PEP should not be discontinued until person is evaluated and treatment plan is established.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n'''STI and HBV testing:''' People with potential exposure to HIV are also at risk of acquiring [[Sexually transmitted infection|STI]] and [[Hepatitis B virus|HBV]]. [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) recommends STI-specific nucleic acid amplification testing ([[NAAT]]) for [[gonorrhea]] and [[chlamydia]] and blood tests for [[syphilis]]. PEP is also active against HBV infections so discontinuation of medication can cause the reactivation of [[Hepatitis B virus|HBV]], though rare. Health care providers must monitor HBV status closely.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n'''Follow up testing:''' [[Serum creatinine]] and estimated [[creatinine clearance]] should be measured at baseline to determine the most appropriate PEP antiretroviral regimen.

In order to determine whether post-exposure prophylaxis is indicated, an evaluation visit will be conducted to consider risk factors associated with developing [[HIV]]. Assessments at this visit will include whether the at-risk person or the potential source-person are [[HIV positive]], details around the potential HIV exposure event, including timing and circumstances, whether other high-risk events have occurred in the past, testing for [[sexually transmitted diseases]], testing for [[hepatitis B]] and [[Hepatitis C|C]] (nPEP is also effective against [[hepatitis B]]), and pregnancy tests for women of childbearing potential.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nRisk factors for developing HIV includes exposure of [[mucous membranes]] (vagina, rectum, eye, mouth, broken skin or under the skin) of an HIV-negative person to [[bodily fluids]] (blood, semen, rectal secretions, vaginal secretions, breast milk) of a person known to be [[HIV positive]]. For example, having [[unprotected sex]] with [[HIV positive]] partner is considered risky, but sharing sex toys, spitting and biting considered to be negligible risks for initiating post-exposure prophylaxis. The highest non-sexual risk is [[blood transfusion]] and the highest sexual contact risk is receptive anal intercourse. The timing of exposure does not affect the risk of developing HIV, but it does alter whether post-exposure prophylaxis will be recommended. Exposures that occurred 72 hours or less to beginning treatment are eligible for post-exposure prophylaxis. If the exposure occurred over 73 hours prior to treatment initiation, post-exposure prophylaxis is not indicated.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Testing ===\n'''Initial HIV testing:''' Before initiating PEP after potential [[HIV]] exposure, persons should be tested for [[HIV1]] and [[HIV2]] antigens and antibodies in the blood using a [[rapid diagnostic test]]. PEP should only be started if rapid diagnostic test reveals no HIV infection present or if tests results are not available.  However, if HIV infection is already present then PEP should not be started. HIV test should be repeated four to six weeks and three months after exposure.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nPeople may experience signs and symptoms of [[acute HIV infection]], including fever, fatigue, myalgia, and skin rash, while taking PEP. CDC recommends seeking medical attention for evaluation if these signs and symptoms occur during or after the month of PEP.  If follow-up laboratory antibody tests reveal HIV infection, HIV treatment specialists should be sought out and PEP should not be discontinued until person is evaluated and treatment plan is established.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n'''STI and HBV testing:''' People with potential exposure to HIV are also at risk of acquiring [[Sexually transmitted infection|STI]] and [[Hepatitis B virus|HBV]]. [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) recommends STI-specific nucleic acid amplification testing ([[NAAT]]) for [[gonorrhea]] and [[chlamydia]] and blood tests for [[syphilis]].
