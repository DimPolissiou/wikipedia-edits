It is the administrative [[Capital (political)|capital]] and commercial centre of Finland's northernmost province, [[Lapland, Finland|Lapland]]. It is situated about {{convert|6|km|0|abbr=off}} south of the [[Arctic Circle]] and is between the hills of Ounasvaara and Korkalovaara, at the [[confluence]] of the river [[Kemijoki]] and its tributary, the [[Ounasjoki]]. \n\nThe city and the surrounding {{lang|fi|[[Rovaniemen maalaiskunta]]}} (Rural municipality of Rovaniemi) were consolidated into a single entity on 1 January 2006. The resulting city of Rovaniemi is considered the largest city in all of [[Europe]] by land area, because the defined limits of the [[city proper]] extend far beyond the actual [[Urban areas in Finland|urban area]].<ref>[https://www.lapland.fi/visit/plan-your-stay/rovaniemi-santa-northern-lights-trip/ Rovaniemi - Capital of Finnish Lapland & Hometown of Santa Claus]</ref> \n\nRovaniemi municipality has an approximate population of {{formatnum: {{#expr: {{Infobox Finnish Municipality/population count|Rovaniemi}} round -3 }}}}. The urban area of Rovaniemi has a population of 53 361, in an area of 59,77 km\u00b2. Rovaniemi is a unilingual [[Finnish language|Finnish]]-speaking municipality and, uncommonly for larger Finnish towns, it is also known by its Finnish name and spelling in the [[Swedish language]].\n\n==Name==\nThe ''rova'' part in the name ''Rovaniemi'' has often been considered to be of [[Saamic]] origin, as ''{{lang|se|roavve}}'' in [[sami language|Saami]] denotes a forested ridge or hill or the site of an old forest fire. In [[Southern Saami]] [[dialects]], however, ''{{lang|sma|rova}}'' means a heap of stones, a rock or a group of rocks in a stretch of rapids or even a sauna stove. {{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} The ''niemi'' part of the name means \"[[Cape (geography)|cape]]\".\nNames in the Samic languages include {{lang-smn|Ru\u00e1vinjarg\u00e2}}, {{lang-se|Roavenj\u00e1rga}} and ''{{lang|se|Roavvenj\u00e1rga}}'' and {{lang-sms|Ru\u00e4\u02cavnjargg}}.\n\n==History==\nPeriodic clearance of new land for [[agriculture]] and the practise of [[slash-and-burn]] cultivation began around 750\u2013530 BC. Artifacts found in the area suggest that an increasing number of travellers from [[Karelia]] in the east, H\u00e4me in the south and the [[Arctic Ocean]] coast in the north must have come there from 500 AD onwards. The [[Sami people|Sami]] are considered to be [[S\u00e1pmi|Lapland]]'s most indigenous existing population.\n\nIt is first mentioned by name in official documents in 1453, existing effectively as a set of small villages whose inhabitants earned their living mainly in agriculture and animal husbandry\u2014with fishing and hunting the most important offshoots. {{citation needed|date=February 2013}}\n\nThe exploitation of Lapland's [[natural resources]] in the 1800s boosted Rovaniemi's growth. Extensive logging sites and gold fever attracted thousands of people to Lapland. As the [[mining]] of natural resources was increased, Rovaniemi became the business centre of the province of Lapland.\n\n===Second World War===\n{{Main|Battle of Rovaniemi}}\n[[File:Rebuilding Rovaniemi in 1949.webm|thumb|left|Rebuilding Rovaniemi in 1949]]\nDuring the [[Second World War]], Finland signed the [[Moscow Armistice]] and found itself involved in the [[Lapland War]] with its former German ally. Retreating German forces utilised [[scorched earth]] tactics, and though initially German General [[Lothar Rendulic]] ordered only the public buildings in Rovaniemi to be destroyed, on 13 October 1944 the German army received orders to destroy all the buildings in Rovaniemi, only excluding hospitals and houses where inhabitants were present.<ref name=\"sk\">Suomen Kuvalehti 39/2004</ref> While the German rear guard was going about the destruction, an ammunition train in Rovaniemi station exploded and set fire to the wooden houses of the town. The German troops suffered many casualties, mainly from glass splinters. A Finnish commando unit claimed to have blown up the ammunition train and may well have been the primary cause of the town's ruin. The cause was then unknown and generally assumed to be the deliberate intent of Rendulic.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} During these hostilities 90% of all the buildings in Rovaniemi were destroyed.<ref name=\"kallioniemi\">Kallioniemi 1989, s. 196\u2013209</ref> There is a German cemetery 19&nbsp;km from Rovaniemi where soldiers killed fighting in Lapland during the war are buried.\n\nAlthough there has been continuous human settlement in the Rovaniemi area since at least the [[Stone Age]], few of the buildings date back before 1944 since most of the city was destroyed during WWII. When the city was rebuilt, it was designed with input by famous Finnish [[architect]] [[Alvar Aalto]], who planned the city's footprint in the shape of a reindeer's head, with the city roads forming the antlers, and the local stadium as the reindeer's eye.<ref>{{cite web |title=There's So Much To See In The Capital Of Finnish Lapland |website=Nordic Visitor |language=en |url=https://lapland.nordicvisitor.com/travel-guide/attractions/rovaniemi/}}</ref>\n\n==Modern day==\n[[File:Rovaniemi 06101999 rescanned.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Rovaniemi in 1999]]\n[[File:Christmas celebration in Rovaniemi.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Christmas]] celebration in Rovaniemi, November 2004]]\nSince Rovaniemi is the [[Capital (political)|capital]] of the [[Lapland (Finland)|region of Lapland]], many government institutions have their offices there. About 10,000 of the inhabitants are students. Rovaniemi is home to not only the [[University of Lapland]] but also the [[Lapland University of Applied Sciences]] (formerly known as the Rovaniemi Polytechnic), which comprises institutes of information and traditional technology, business, health and social care, culinary studies, [[forestry]], rural studies, and sports. Local newspapers include the ''Lapin Kansa'', ''Uusi Rovaniemi'' and ''Lappilainen''.\n\nRovaniemi's most prominent landmarks include the J\u00e4tk\u00e4nkynttil\u00e4 bridge with its eternal flame over the Kemijoki river, the [[Arktikum Science Museum]] which rises out of the bank of the Ounasjoki river, the Rovaniemi Town Hall, the Lappia House (which serves as a theatre, concert hall, and congress centre), and the library. The last three mentioned buildings are designed by the famous Finnish architect [[Alvar Aalto]]. The Arktikum Science Museum is a comprehensive museum of Finland's, and the world's, Arctic regions.\n\n===Tourism===\nBecause of the unspoiled nature of the area and numerous recreational opportunities, [[tourism]] is an important [[industry]] in Rovaniemi. The city has a number of hotels and restaurants located both in the centre and on the outskirts of the town, hosting over 481,000 visitors in 2013.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.visitrovaniemi.fi/sites/visitrovaniemi.fi/files/roi_press_eng_2014.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-05-28 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150528074751/http://www.visitrovaniemi.fi/sites/visitrovaniemi.fi/files/roi_press_eng_2014.pdf |archivedate=2015-05-28 }}</ref>\n\nRovaniemi is also considered by Finns to be the official home town of [[Santa Claus]].<ref name=\"northpole\">{{cite web|url=http://www.the-north-pole.com/history|title=History of Santa Claus|website=The-north-pole.com|accessdate=24 December 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"village\">[http://www.santaclausvillage.info/eng/main.htm Santa Claus' Village on the Arctic Circle in Rovaniemi in Lapland in Finland] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080511171444/http://www.santaclausvillage.info/eng/main.htm |date=2008-05-11 }}</ref><ref name=\"office\">{{cite web|url=http://www.santaclauslive.com/main.php?link=joulupukin_kammari&kieli=eng|title=Joulupukin Kammari \u2013 Santa Claus Office \u2013 Joulupkki, Lapland, Finland, Rovaniemi|website=Santaclauslive.com|accessdate=24 December 2017}}</ref> It is home to the [[Santa Claus Village]] at the Arctic Circle and [[Santa Park|SantaPark Arctic World]], which is located {{convert|8|km|0|abbr=on}} north of the centre. \n\nDirectly across the river from the town is the Ounasvaara ski centre. The top of the Ounasvaara hill bears the site of some of the earliest known human settlements in the area.\n\nA phenomenon also attracting numerous tourists is the [[Aurora Borealis]] or ''Northern Lights''. In Finnish [[Lapland, Finland|Lapland]], the number of auroral displays can be as high as 200 a year whereas in southern Finland the number is usually fewer than 20.\n\n==Transport==\n[[File:Train at Rovaniemi railway station.jpg|thumb|260px|Rovaniemi railway station]]\n[[VR Group]], the Finnish state railway system, operates direct daytime and overnight passenger trains from [[Rovaniemi railway station|Rovaniemi Station]] to [[Oulu]], [[Tampere]], [[Helsinki]] and [[Turku]]. [[Diesel locomotive|Diesel]]-powered passenger trains operated north-east of Rovaniemi to [[Kemij\u00e4rvi]] until March 2014, when electrification to [[Kemij\u00e4rvi]] was completed. [[Rovaniemi Airport]] is located about {{convert|10|km|0}} north of the Rovaniemi city centre.\n[[File:Tk3 1147 in Rovaniemi 20120210 01.jpg|thumb|260px|Steam Locomotive [[VR Class Tk3]] 1147 at Rovaniemi railway station]]\n\n== Geography ==\n\n=== Climate ===\n\n{{climate chart|Rovaniemi\n|-14.5|-8.2|42.1\n|-13.8|-7.8|33.6\n|-9.4|-2.6|35.6\n|-3.9|3.6|30.9\n|2.3|10.8|35.9\n|7.3|16.8|59.1\n|11.0|19.7|69.1\n|9.1|16.5|71.7\n|4.2|10.4|54.0\n|-1.3|3.1|54.6\n|-7.9|-3|48.6\n|-12.5|-6.4|41.7\n|float=right\n|clear=both\n|source=[http://www.worldweather.org/061/c00172.htm [[World Meteorological Organization]]]\n}}\nDue to its location near the Arctic Circle, Rovaniemi has a [[subarctic climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen]] ''Dfc'') with short, pleasant summers, while the winters are long, cold and snowy. The city lies just south of the {{convert|0|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}} mean annual isotherm, but freezing in the soil is very limited even during the winter due to typical heavy snow cover. Its extreme northerly location combined with frequent overcast skies leads to very low levels of sunshine in the winter months; December averages just under six minutes of sunshine daily. Winters are somewhat modified by marine air from the [[North Atlantic Current]] that ensures average temperatures are less extreme than expected for an inland area at such a northerly latitude.\nOn 26 April 2019, Rovaniemi recorded its warmest April day on record with {{convert|19|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}}.<ref>https://weather.com/en-GB/weather/today/l/66.50,25.73?par=google</ref>\n{{Weather box\n|location = Rovaniemi Lentoasema, elevation: 196m (1981-2010) Extremes (1959-present)\n|collapsed =\n|metric first = y\n|single line = y\n|Jan record high C = 6.9\n|Feb record high C = 7.4\n|Mar record high C = 9.5\n|Apr record high C = 19.0\n|May record high C = 28.2\n|Jun record high C = 30.7\n|Jul record high C = 32.2\n|Aug record high C = 29.1\n|Sep record high C = 22.6\n|Oct record high C = 15.6\n|Nov record high C = 8.7\n|Dec record high C = 5.0\n|year record high C = 32.2\n|Jan high C = -8.2\n|Feb high C = -7.8\n|Mar high C = -2.6\n|Apr high C = 3.6\n|May high C = 10.8\n|Jun high C = 16.8\n|Jul high C = 19.7\n|Aug high C = 16.5\n|Sep high C = 10.4\n|Oct high C = 3.1\n|Nov high C = -3.0\n|Dec high C = -6.4\n|year high C = 4.4\n|Jan mean C = -11.3\n|Feb mean C = -10.8\n|Mar mean C = -6.1\n|Apr mean C = -0.2\n|May mean C = 6.3\n|Jun mean C = 12.2\n|Jul mean C = 15.2\n|Aug mean C = 12.5\n|Sep mean C = 7.1\n|Oct mean C = 0.8\n|Nov mean C = -5.5\n|Dec mean C = -9.4\n|year mean C = 0.9\n|Jan low C = -14.5\n|Feb low C = -13.8\n|Mar low C = -9.4\n|Apr low C = -3.9\n|May low C = 2.3\n|Jun low C = 8.3\n|Jul low C = 11.4\n|Aug low C = 9.1\n|Sep low C = 4.2\n|Oct low C = -1.3\n|Nov low C = -7.9\n|Dec low C = -12.5\n|year low C = -2.3\n|Jan record low C = -38.1\n|Feb record low C = -35.0\n|Mar record low C = -27.5\n|Apr record low C = -18.7\n|May record low C = -11.0\n|Jun record low C = -2.6\n|Jul record low C = 2.4\n|Aug record low C = -0.6\n|Sep record low C = -7.7\n|Oct record low C = -21.5\n|Nov record low C = -27.9\n|Dec record low C = -32.9\n|year record low C = -38.1\n|precipitation colour = green\n|Jan precipitation mm = 42.1\n|Feb precipitation mm = 33.6\n|Mar precipitation mm = 35.6\n|Apr precipitation mm = 30.9\n|May precipitation mm = 35.9\n|Jun precipitation mm = 59.1\n|Jul precipitation mm = 69.1\n|Aug precipitation mm = 71.7\n|Sep precipitation mm = 54.0\n|Oct precipitation mm = 54.6\n|Nov precipitation mm = 48.6\n|Dec precipitation mm = 41.7\n|year precipitation mm = 576.9\n|Jan precipitation days = 10\n|Feb precipitation days = 10\n|Mar precipitation days = 9\n|Apr precipitation days = 7\n|May precipitation days = 8\n|Jun precipitation days = 9\n|Jul precipitation days = 10\n|Aug precipitation days = 10\n|Sep precipitation days = 9\n|Oct precipitation days = 11\n|Nov precipitation days = 12\n|Dec precipitation days = 10\n|year precipitation days = 115\n|Jan sun = 15\n|Feb sun = 57\n|Mar sun = 132\n|Apr sun = 203\n|May sun = 237\n|Jun sun = 271\n|Jul sun = 260\n|Aug sun = 182\n|Sep sun = 112\n|Oct sun = 60\n|Nov sun = 18\n|Dec sun = 3\n|year sun = 1550\n|source 1 = Finnish Meteorological Institute<ref name=\"Met Averages\">{{cite web|url=http://en.ilmatieteenlaitos.fi/normal-period-1981-2010|title= Normal period 1981\u20132010|accessdate=4 November 2012|publisher=FMI}}</ref>\n|source 2 = FMI <ref>{{cite web\n| url=http://suja.kapsi.fi/asema-taulukko.php?asema=101920| title = Rovaniemi extreme values | accessdate =18 May 2016 | publisher = [[FMI open data]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wunderground.com/personal-weather-station/dashboard?ID=IROVANIE6#history/s20170213/e20170213/mdaily|title=Rantavitikka, Lapland UAS Weather -

It is the administrative [[Capital (political)|capital]] and commercial centre of Finland's northernmost province, [[Lapland, Finland|Lapland]]. It is situated about {{convert|6|km|0|abbr=off}} south of the [[Arctic Circle]] and is between the hills of Ounasvaara and Korkalovaara, at the [[confluence]] of the river [[Kemijoki]] and its tributary, the [[Ounasjoki]]. \n\nThe city and the surrounding {{lang|fi|[[Rovaniemen maalaiskunta]]}} (Rural municipality of Rovaniemi) were consolidated into a single entity on 1 January 2006. The resulting city of Rovaniemi is considered the largest city in all of [[Europe]] by land area, because the defined limits of the [[city proper]] extend far beyond the actual [[Urban areas in Finland|urban area]].<ref>[https://www.lapland.fi/visit/plan-your-stay/rovaniemi-santa-northern-lights-trip/ Rovaniemi - Capital of Finnish Lapland & Hometown of Santa Claus]</ref> \n\nRovaniemi municipality has an approximate population of {{formatnum: {{#expr: {{Infobox Finnish Municipality/population count|Rovaniemi}} round -3 }}}}. The urban area of Rovaniemi has a populaton of 53 361, in an area of 59,77 km\u00b2. Rovaniemi is a unilingual [[Finnish language|Finnish]]-speaking municipality and, uncommonly for larger Finnish towns, it is also known by its Finnish name and spelling in the [[Swedish language]].\n\n==Name==\nThe ''rova'' part in the name ''Rovaniemi'' has often been considered to be of [[Saamic]] origin, as ''{{lang|se|roavve}}'' in [[sami language|Saami]] denotes a forested ridge or hill or the site of an old forest fire. In [[Southern Saami]] [[dialects]], however, ''{{lang|sma|rova}}'' means a heap of stones, a rock or a group of rocks in a stretch of rapids or even a sauna stove. {{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} The ''niemi'' part of the name means \"[[Cape (geography)|cape]]\".\nNames in the Samic languages include {{lang-smn|Ru\u00e1vinjarg\u00e2}}, {{lang-se|Roavenj\u00e1rga}} and ''{{lang|se|Roavvenj\u00e1rga}}'' and {{lang-sms|Ru\u00e4\u02cavnjargg}}.\n\n==History==\nPeriodic clearance of new land for [[agriculture]] and the practise of [[slash-and-burn]] cultivation began around 750\u2013530 BC. Artifacts found in the area suggest that an increasing number of travellers from [[Karelia]] in the east, H\u00e4me in the south and the [[Arctic Ocean]] coast in the north must have come there from 500 AD onwards. The [[Sami people|Sami]] are considered to be [[S\u00e1pmi|Lapland]]'s most indigenous existing population.\n\nIt is first mentioned by name in official documents in 1453, existing effectively as a set of small villages whose inhabitants earned their living mainly in agriculture and animal husbandry\u2014with fishing and hunting the most important offshoots. {{citation needed|date=February 2013}}\n\nThe exploitation of Lapland's [[natural resources]] in the 1800s boosted Rovaniemi's growth. Extensive logging sites and gold fever attracted thousands of people to Lapland. As the [[mining]] of natural resources was increased, Rovaniemi became the business centre of the province of Lapland.\n\n===Second World War===\n{{Main|Battle of Rovaniemi}}\n[[File:Rebuilding Rovaniemi in 1949.webm|thumb|left|Rebuilding Rovaniemi in 1949]]\nDuring the [[Second World War]], Finland signed the [[Moscow Armistice]] and found itself involved in the [[Lapland War]] with its former German ally. Retreating German forces utilised [[scorched earth]] tactics, and though initially German General [[Lothar Rendulic]] ordered only the public buildings in Rovaniemi to be destroyed, on 13 October 1944 the German army received orders to destroy all the buildings in Rovaniemi, only excluding hospitals and houses where inhabitants were present.<ref name=\"sk\">Suomen Kuvalehti 39/2004</ref> While the German rear guard was going about the destruction, an ammunition train in Rovaniemi station exploded and set fire to the wooden houses of the town. The German troops suffered many casualties, mainly from glass splinters. A Finnish commando unit claimed to have blown up the ammunition train and may well have been the primary cause of the town's ruin. The cause was then unknown and generally assumed to be the deliberate intent of Rendulic.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} During these hostilities 90% of all the buildings in Rovaniemi were destroyed.<ref name=\"kallioniemi\">Kallioniemi 1989, s. 196\u2013209</ref> There is a German cemetery 19&nbsp;km from Rovaniemi where soldiers killed fighting in Lapland during the war are buried.\n\nAlthough there has been continuous human settlement in the Rovaniemi area since at least the [[Stone Age]], few of the buildings date back before 1944 since most of the city was destroyed during WWII. When the city was rebuilt, it was designed with input by famous Finnish [[architect]] [[Alvar Aalto]], who planned the city's footprint in the shape of a reindeer's head, with the city roads forming the antlers, and the local stadium as the reindeer's eye.<ref>{{cite web |title=There's So Much To See In The Capital Of Finnish Lapland |website=Nordic Visitor |language=en |url=https://lapland.nordicvisitor.com/travel-guide/attractions/rovaniemi/}}</ref>\n\n==Modern day==\n[[File:Rovaniemi 06101999 rescanned.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Rovaniemi in 1999]]\n[[File:Christmas celebration in Rovaniemi.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Christmas]] celebration in Rovaniemi, November 2004]]\nSince Rovaniemi is the [[Capital (political)|capital]] of the [[Lapland (Finland)|region of Lapland]], many government institutions have their offices there. About 10,000 of the inhabitants are students. Rovaniemi is home to not only the [[University of Lapland]] but also the [[Lapland University of Applied Sciences]] (formerly known as the Rovaniemi Polytechnic), which comprises institutes of information and traditional technology, business, health and social care, culinary studies, [[forestry]], rural studies, and sports. Local newspapers include the ''Lapin Kansa'', ''Uusi Rovaniemi'' and ''Lappilainen''.\n\nRovaniemi's most prominent landmarks include the J\u00e4tk\u00e4nkynttil\u00e4 bridge with its eternal flame over the Kemijoki river, the [[Arktikum Science Museum]] which rises out of the bank of the Ounasjoki river, the Rovaniemi Town Hall, the Lappia House (which serves as a theatre, concert hall, and congress centre), and the library. The last three mentioned buildings are designed by the famous Finnish architect [[Alvar Aalto]]. The Arktikum Science Museum is a comprehensive museum of Finland's, and the world's, Arctic regions.\n\n===Tourism===\nBecause of the unspoiled nature of the area and numerous recreational opportunities, [[tourism]] is an important [[industry]] in Rovaniemi. The city has a number of hotels and restaurants located both in the centre and on the outskirts of the town, hosting over 481,000 visitors in 2013.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.visitrovaniemi.fi/sites/visitrovaniemi.fi/files/roi_press_eng_2014.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-05-28 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150528074751/http://www.visitrovaniemi.fi/sites/visitrovaniemi.fi/files/roi_press_eng_2014.pdf |archivedate=2015-05-28 }}</ref>\n\nRovaniemi is also considered by Finns to be the official home town of [[Santa Claus]].<ref name=\"northpole\">{{cite web|url=http://www.the-north-pole.com/history|title=History of Santa Claus|website=The-north-pole.com|accessdate=24 December 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"village\">[http://www.santaclausvillage.info/eng/main.htm Santa Claus' Village on the Arctic Circle in Rovaniemi in Lapland in Finland] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080511171444/http://www.santaclausvillage.info/eng/main.htm |date=2008-05-11 }}</ref><ref name=\"office\">{{cite web|url=http://www.santaclauslive.com/main.php?link=joulupukin_kammari&kieli=eng|title=Joulupukin Kammari \u2013 Santa Claus Office \u2013 Joulupkki, Lapland, Finland, Rovaniemi|website=Santaclauslive.com|accessdate=24 December 2017}}</ref> It is home to the [[Santa Claus Village]] at the Arctic Circle and [[Santa Park|SantaPark Arctic World]], which is located {{convert|8|km|0|abbr=on}} north of the centre. \n\nDirectly across the river from the town is the Ounasvaara ski centre. The top of the Ounasvaara hill bears the site of some of the earliest known human settlements in the area.\n\nA phenomenon also attracting numerous tourists is the [[Aurora Borealis]] or ''Northern Lights''. In Finnish [[Lapland, Finland|Lapland]], the number of auroral displays can be as high as 200 a year whereas in southern Finland the number is usually fewer than 20.\n\n==Transport==\n[[File:Train at Rovaniemi railway station.jpg|thumb|260px|Rovaniemi railway station]]\n[[VR Group]], the Finnish state railway system, operates direct daytime and overnight passenger trains from [[Rovaniemi railway station|Rovaniemi Station]] to [[Oulu]], [[Tampere]], [[Helsinki]] and [[Turku]].

The city lies just south of the {{convert|0|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}} mean annual isotherm, but freezing in the soil is very limited even during the winter due to typical heavy snow cover. Its extreme northerly location combined with frequent overcast skies leads to very low levels of sunshine in the winter months; December averages just under six minutes of sunshine daily. Winters are somewhat modified by marine air from the [[North Atlantic Current]] that ensures average temperatures are less extreme than expected for an inland area at such a northerly latitude.\nOn 26 April 2019, Rovaniemi recorded its warmest April day on record with {{convert|19|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}}.<ref>https://weather.com/en-GB/weather/today/l/66.50,25.73?par=google</ref>\n{{Weather box\n|location = Rovaniemi Lentoasema, elevation: 196m (1981-2010) Extremes (1959-present)\n|collapsed =\n|metric first = y\n|single line = y\n|Jan record high C = 6.9\n|Feb record high C = 7.4\n|Mar record high C = 9.5\n|Apr record high C = 19.0\n|May record high C = 28.2\n|Jun record high C = 30.7\n|Jul record high C = 32.2\n|Aug record high C = 29.1\n|Sep record high C = 22.6\n|Oct record high C = 15.6\n|Nov record high C = 8.7\n|Dec record high C = 5.0\n|year record high C = 32.2\n|Jan high C = -8.2\n|Feb high C = -7.8\n|Mar high C = -2.6\n|Apr high C = 3.6\n|May high C = 10.8\n|Jun high C = 16.8\n|Jul high C = 19.7\n|Aug high C = 16.5\n|Sep high C = 10.4\n|Oct high C = 3.1\n|Nov high C = -3.0\n|Dec high C = -6.4\n|year high C = 4.4\n|Jan mean C = -11.3\n|Feb mean C = -10.8\n|Mar mean C = -6.1\n|Apr mean C = -0.2\n|May mean C = 6.3\n|Jun mean C = 12.2\n|Jul mean C = 15.2\n|Aug mean C = 12.5\n|Sep mean C = 7.1\n|Oct mean C = 0.8\n|Nov mean C = -5.5\n|Dec mean C = -9.4\n|year mean C = 0.9\n|Jan low C = -14.5\n|Feb low C = -13.8\n|Mar low C = -9.4\n|Apr low C = -3.9\n|May low C = 2.3\n|Jun low C = 8.3\n|Jul low C = 11.4\n|Aug low C = 9.1\n|Sep low C = 4.2\n|Oct low C = -1.3\n|Nov low C = -7.9\n|Dec low C = -12.5\n|year low C = -2.3\n|Jan record low C = -38.1\n|Feb record low C = -35.0\n|Mar record low C = -27.5\n|Apr record low C = -18.7\n|May record low C = -11.0\n|Jun record low C = -2.6\n|Jul record low C = 2.4\n|Aug record low C = -0.6\n|Sep record low C = -7.7\n|Oct record low C = -21.5\n|Nov record low C = -27.9\n|Dec record low C = -32.9\n|year record low C = -38.1\n|precipitation colour = green\n|Jan precipitation mm = 42.1\n|Feb precipitation mm = 33.6\n|Mar precipitation mm = 35.6\n|Apr precipitation mm = 30.9\n|May precipitation mm = 35.9\n|Jun precipitation mm = 59.1\n|Jul precipitation mm = 69.1\n|Aug precipitation mm = 71.7\n|Sep precipitation mm = 54.0\n|Oct precipitation mm = 54.6\n|Nov precipitation mm = 48.6\n|Dec precipitation mm = 41.7\n|year precipitation mm = 576.9\n|Jan precipitation days = 10\n|Feb precipitation days = 10\n|Mar precipitation days = 9\n|Apr precipitation days = 7\n|May precipitation days = 8\n|Jun precipitation days = 9\n|Jul precipitation days = 10\n|Aug precipitation days = 10\n|Sep precipitation days = 9\n|Oct precipitation days = 11\n|Nov precipitation days = 12\n|Dec precipitation days = 10\n|year precipitation days = 115\n|Jan sun = 15\n|Feb sun = 57\n|Mar sun = 132\n|Apr sun = 203\n|May sun = 237\n|Jun sun = 271\n|Jul sun = 260\n|Aug sun = 182\n|Sep sun = 112\n|Oct sun = 60\n|Nov sun = 18\n|Dec sun = 3\n|year sun = 1550\n|source 1 = Finnish Meteorological Institute<ref name=\"Met Averages\">{{cite web|url=http://en.ilmatieteenlaitos.fi/normal-period-1981-2010|title= Normal period 1981\u20132010|accessdate=4 November 2012|publisher=FMI}}</ref>\n|source 2 = FMI <ref>{{cite web\n| url=http://suja.kapsi.fi/asema-taulukko.php?asema=101920| title = Rovaniemi extreme values | accessdate =18 May 2016 | publisher = [[FMI open data]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wunderground.com/personal-weather-station/dashboard?ID=IROVANIE6#history/s20170213/e20170213/mdaily|title=Rantavitikka, Lapland UAS Weather -

The events depicted are some of the lesser-known mythological events surrounding the trials and tribulations of Hanuman, while he was combating the evil and malevolent forces espoused by characters such as [[Raavana]]. Through the course of the show, the makers of the series plan to reveal the miraculous powers and the immeasurable physical strength [[Hanuman]] derives from [[Shiva|Lord Shiva]], which ultimately helps him pursue his noble endeavors and win his fights against all evil forces he encounters.\n\n\n\n\n== Plot ==\n=== Panchamuki Anjaneya Swami Temple; Karnataka===\n\nHanuman proves Varun wrong when Dhartidhol Prasad comes with an answer and at same time Arun shouts the answer. Pradhan Jaipal announces the last competition of Mallayudh that should be started. The first Mallayudh happens between Dhartidhol Prasad and Sanjay followed by Mukesh competing with Arun and then between Varun and Vikram.
