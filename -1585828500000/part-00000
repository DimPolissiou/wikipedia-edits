Forty times, it is said, he read through the ''Metaphysics'' of Aristotle, till the words were imprinted on his memory; but their meaning was hopelessly obscure to him until he purchased a brief commentary by al-Farabi from a bookstall for three dirhams (a very low price at the time).

Ibn Sina's chief reward for this service was access to the royal library of the Samanids, well-known patrons of scholarship and scholars. When the library was destroyed by fire not long after, the enemies of Ibn Sina accused him of burning it, in order for ever to conceal the sources of his knowledge. Meanwhile, he assisted his father in his financial labors, but still found time to write some of his earliest works.<ref name=\"EB1911\" />\n\nAt 22 years old, Avicenna lost his father. The Samanid dynasty came to its end in December 1004. Avicenna seems to have declined the offers of [[Mahmud of Ghazni]], and proceeded westwards to [[Konye-Urgench|Urgench]] in modern [[Turkmenistan]], where the [[vizier]], regarded as a friend of scholars, gave him a small monthly stipend. The pay was small, however, so Ibn Sina wandered from place to place through the districts of [[Nishapur]] and [[Merv]] to the borders of [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]], seeking an opening for his talents. [[Qabus]], the generous ruler of [[Tabaristan]], himself a poet and a scholar, with whom Ibn Sina had expected to find asylum, was on about that date (1012) starved to death by his troops who had revolted. Avicenna himself was at this time stricken by a severe illness. Finally, at [[Gorgan]], near the [[Caspian Sea]], Avicenna met with a friend, who bought a dwelling near his own house in which Avicenna lectured on [[logic]] and [[astronomy]]. Several of his treatises were written for this patron; and the commencement of his ''Canon of Medicine'' also dates from his stay in [[Hyrcania]].<ref name=\"EB1911\" />\n\nAvicenna subsequently settled at [[Rey, Iran|Rey]], in the vicinity of modern [[Tehran]], the home town of [[Al-Razi|Rhazes]]; where [[Abu Taleb Rostam|Majd Addaula]], a son of the last [[Buwayhid]] emir, was nominal ruler under the regency of his mother ([[Seyyedeh Khatun]]). About thirty of Ibn Sina's shorter works are said to have been composed in Rey. Constant feuds which raged between the regent and her second son, [[Shams al-Daula]], however, compelled the scholar to quit the place. After a brief sojourn at [[Qazvin (city)|Qazvin]] he passed southwards to Hamad\u00e3n where Shams al-Daula, another Buwayhid emir, had established himself. At first, Ibn Sina entered into the service of a high-born lady; but the emir, hearing of his arrival, called him in as medical attendant, and sent him back with presents to his dwelling. Ibn Sina was even raised to the office of vizier. The emir decreed that he should be banished from the country. Ibn Sina, however, remained hidden for forty days in sheikh Ahmed Fadhel's house, until a fresh attack of illness induced the emir to restore him to his post. Even during this perturbed time, Ibn Sina persevered with his studies and teaching. Every evening, extracts from his great works, the ''Canon'' and the ''Sanatio'', were dictated and explained to his pupils. On the death of the emir, Ibn Sina ceased to be vizier and hid himself in the house of an [[apothecary]], where, with intense assiduity, he continued the composition of his works.<ref name=\"EB1911\" />\n\nMeanwhile, he had written to Abu Ya'far, the prefect of the dynamic city of [[Isfahan]], offering his services. The new emir of Hamadan, hearing of this correspondence and discovering where Ibn Sina was hiding, incarcerated him in a fortress. War meanwhile continued between the rulers of Isfahan and Hamad\u00e3n; in 1024 the former captured Hamadan and its towns, expelling the Tajik mercenaries. When the storm had passed, Ibn Sina returned with the emir to Hamadan, and carried on his literary labors. Later, however, accompanied by his brother, a favorite pupil, and two slaves, Ibn Sina escaped from the city in the dress of a [[Sufi]] [[ascetic]]. After a perilous journey, they reached Isfahan, receiving an honorable welcome from the prince.<ref name=\"EB1911\" />\n\n=== Later life and death ===\n[[File:Avicenna canon 1597.jpg|thumb|upright|The first page of a manuscript of Avicenna's ''Canon'', dated 1596/7 (Yale, Medical Historical Library, Cushing Arabic ms. 5)]]\nThe remaining ten or twelve years of Ibn S\u012bn\u0101's life were spent in the service of the [[Kakuyid]] ruler [[Muhammad ibn Rustam Dushmanziyar]] (also known as Ala al-Dawla), whom he accompanied as physician and general literary and scientific adviser, even in his numerous campaigns.<ref name=\"EB1911\" />\n\nDuring these years he began to study literary matters and [[philology]], instigated, it is asserted, by criticisms on his style. A severe [[colic]], which seized him on the march of the army against Hamadan, was checked by remedies so violent that Ibn Sina could scarcely stand. On a similar occasion the disease returned; with difficulty he reached Hamadan, where, finding the disease gaining ground, he refused to keep up the regimen imposed, and resigned himself to his fate.<ref name=\"EB1911\" />\n\nHis friends advised him to slow down and take life moderately.

Whereas existence is the domain of the contingent and the accidental, essence endures within a being beyond the accidental. The philosophy of Ibn S\u012bn\u0101, particularly that part relating to metaphysics, owes much to al-Farabi. The search for a definitive Islamic philosophy separate from [[Occasionalism]] can be seen in what is left of his work.\n\nFollowing al-Farabi's lead, Avicenna initiated a full-fledged inquiry into the question of being, in which he distinguished between essence (''Mahiat'') and existence (''Wujud''). He argued that the fact of existence cannot be inferred from or accounted for by the essence of existing things, and that form and matter by themselves cannot interact and originate the movement of the universe or the progressive actualization of existing things. Existence must, therefore, be due to an [[Causality|agent-cause]] that necessitates, imparts, gives, or adds existence to an essence. To do so, the cause must be an existing thing and coexist with its effect.<ref name=\"Islam in Britannica\">{{Cite encyclopedia |year=2007 |title=Islam |encyclopedia=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Online |url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-69190/Islam |accessdate=2007-11-27 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071222082832/http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-69190/Islam |archivedate=22 December 2007 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nAvicenna's consideration of the essence-attributes question may be elucidated in terms of his ontological analysis of the modalities of being; namely impossibility, contingency, and necessity. Avicenna argued that the impossible being is that which cannot exist, while the contingent in itself (''mumkin bi-dhatihi'') has the potentiality to be or not to be without entailing a contradiction. When actualized, the contingent becomes a 'necessary existent due to what is other than itself' (''wajib al-wujud bi-ghayrihi''). Thus, contingency-in-itself is potential beingness that could eventually be actualized by an external cause other than itself. The metaphysical structures of necessity and contingency are different. Necessary being due to itself (''wajib al-wujud bi-dhatihi'') is true in itself, while the contingent being is 'false in itself' and 'true due to something else other than itself'. The necessary is the source of its own being without borrowed existence. It is what always exists.<ref>Avicenna, ''Kitab al-shifa', Metaphysics II'', (eds.) G.C.

In general these treatises linked his philosophical writings to Islamic religious ideas; for example, the body's afterlife.\n\nThere are occasional brief hints and allusions in his longer works however that Avicenna considered philosophy as the only sensible way to distinguish real prophecy from illusion. He did not state this more clearly because of the political implications of such a theory, if prophecy could be questioned, and also because most of the time he was writing shorter works which concentrated on explaining his theories on philosophy and theology clearly, without digressing to consider [[epistemological]] matters which could only be properly considered by other philosophers.<ref>James W.

Avicenna believed his \"Floating Man\" thought experiment demonstrated that the soul is a substance, and claimed humans cannot doubt their own consciousness, even in a situation that prevents all sensory data input. The thought experiment told its readers to imagine themselves created all at once while suspended in the air, isolated from all [[Wikt:sensation|sensations]], which includes no sensory contact with even their own bodies. He argued that, in this scenario, one would still have [[self-consciousness]]. Because it is conceivable that a person, suspended in air while cut off from [[empirical evidence|sense experience]], would still be capable of determining his own existence, the thought experiment points to the conclusions that the soul is a perfection, independent of the body, and an immaterial substance.<ref>See a discussion of this in connection with an analytic take on the philosophy of mind in: [[Nader El-Bizri]], 'Avicenna and the Problem of Consciousness', in ''Consciousness and the Great Philosophers'', eds. S. Leach and J. Tartaglia (London: Routledge, 2016), 45\u201353</ref> The conceivability of this \"Floating Man\" indicates that the soul is perceived intellectually, which entails the soul's separateness from the body. Avicenna referred to the living human [[nous|intelligence]], particularly the [[active intellect]], which he believed to be the [[hypostatic abstraction|hypostasis]] by which God communicates [[truth]] to the human mind and imparts order and intelligibility to nature. Following is an English translation of the argument:\n\n{{quote|One of us (i.e. a human being) should be imagined as having been created in a single stroke; created perfect and complete but with his vision obscured so that he cannot perceive external entities; created falling through air or a void, in such a manner that he is not struck by the firmness of the air in any way that compels him to feel it, and with his limbs separated so that they do not come in contact with or touch each other. Then contemplate the following: can he be assured of the existence of himself? He does not have any doubt in that his self exists, without thereby asserting that he has any exterior limbs, nor any internal organs, neither heart nor brain, nor any one of the exterior things at all; but rather he can affirm the existence of himself, without thereby asserting there that this self has any extension in space. Even if it were possible for him in that state to imagine a hand or any other limb, he would not imagine it as being a part of his self, nor as a condition for the existence of that self; for as you know that which is asserted is different from that which is not asserted and that which is inferred is different from that which is not inferred. Therefore the self, the existence of which has been asserted, is a unique characteristic, in as much that it is not as such the same as the body or the limbs, which have not been ascertained. Thus that which is ascertained (i.e. the self), does have a way of being sure of the existence of the soul as something other than the body, even something non-bodily; this he knows, this he should understand intuitively, if it is that he is ignorant of it and needs to be beaten with a stick [to realize it].|Ibn Sina|Kitab Al-Shifa, On the Soul<ref name=\"Nader El-Bizri 2000\" /><ref>Ibn Sina, ''\u0627\u0644\u0641\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0627\u062f\u0633 \u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0637\u0628\u064a\u0639\u064a\u0627\u062a \u0645\u0646 \u0643\u062a\u0627\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u0634\u0641\u0627\u0621 \u0627\u0644\u0642\u0633\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0648\u0644'' (Beirut, Lebanon.: M.A.J.D Enterprise Universitaire d'Etude et de Publication S.A.R.L)\n{{quote|{{lang|ar|\u064a\u062c\u0628 \u0623\u0646 \u064a\u062a\u0648\u0647\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0648\u0627\u062d\u062f \u0645\u0646\u0627 \u0643\u0623\u0646\u0647 \u062e\u0644\u0642 \u062f\u0641\u0639\u0629\u064b \u0648\u062e\u0644\u0642 \u0643\u0627\u0645\u0644\u0627\u064b \u0644\u0643\u0646\u0647 \u062d\u062c\u0628 \u0628\u0635\u0631\u0647 \u0639\u0646 \u0645\u0634\u0627\u0647\u062f\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u062e\u0627\u0631\u062c\u0627\u062a \u0648\u062e\u0644\u0642 \u064a\u0647\u0648\u0649 \u0641\u064a \u0647\u0648\u0627\u0621 \u0623\u0648 \u062e\u0644\u0627\u0621 \u0647\u0648\u064a\u0627\u064b \u0644\u0627 \u064a\u0635\u062f\u0645\u0647 \u0641\u064a\u0647 \u0642\u0648\u0627\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0647\u0648\u0627\u0621 \u0635\u062f\u0645\u0627\u064b \u0645\u0627 \u064a\u062d\u0648\u062c \u0625\u0644\u0649 \u0623\u0646 \u064a\u062d\u0633 \u0648\u0641\u0631\u0642 \u0628\u064a\u0646 \u0623\u0639\u0636\u0627\u0626\u0647 \u0641\u0644\u0645 \u062a\u062a\u0644\u0627\u0642 \u0648\u0644\u0645 \u062a\u062a\u0645\u0627\u0633 \u062b\u0645 \u064a\u062a\u0623\u0645\u0644 \u0647\u0644 \u0623\u0646\u0647 \u064a\u062b\u0628\u062a \u0648\u062c\u0648\u062f \u0630\u0627\u062a\u0647 \u0648\u0644\u0627 \u064a\u0634\u0643\u0643 \u0641\u064a \u0625\u062b\u0628\u0627\u062a\u0647 \u0644\u0630\u0627\u062a\u0647 \u0645\u0648\u062c\u0648\u062f\u0627\u064b \u0648\u0644\u0627 \u064a\u062b\u0628\u062a \u0645\u0639 \u0630\u0644\u0643 \u0637\u0631\u0641\u0627\u064b \u0645\u0646 \u0623\u0639\u0636\u0627\u0626\u0647 \u0648\u0644\u0627 \u0628\u0627\u0637\u0646\u0627\u064b \u0645\u0646 \u0623\u062d\u0634\u0627\u0626\u0647 \u0648\u0644\u0627 \u0642\u0644\u0628\u0627\u064b \u0648\u0644\u0627 \u062f\u0645\u0627\u063a\u0627\u064b \u0648\u0644\u0627 \u0634\u064a\u0626\u0627\u064b \u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0634\u064a\u0627\u0621 \u0645\u0646 \u062e\u0627\u0631\u062c \u0628\u0644 \u0643\u0627\u0646 \u064a\u062b\u0628\u062a \u0630\u0627\u062a\u0647 \u0648\u0644\u0627 \u064a\u062b\u0628\u062a \u0644\u0647\u0627 \u0637\u0648\u0644\u0627\u064b \u0648\u0644\u0627 \u0639\u0631\u0636\u0627\u064b \u0648\u0644\u0627 \u0639\u0645\u0642\u0627\u064b \u0648\u0644\u0648 \u0623\u0646\u0647 \u0623\u0645\u0643\u0646\u0647 \u0641\u064a \u062a\u0644\u0643 \u0627\u0644\u062d\u0627\u0644\u0629 \u0623\u0646 \u064a\u062a\u062e\u064a\u0644 \u064a\u062f\u0627\u064b \u0623\u0648 \u0639\u0636\u0648\u0627\u064b \u0622\u062e\u0631  \u0644\u0645 \u064a\u062a\u062e\u064a\u0644\u0647 \u062c\u0632\u0621 \u0645\u0646 \u0630\u0627\u062a\u0647 \u0648\u0644\u0627  \u0634\u0631\u0637\u0627\u064b \u0641\u064a \u0630\u0627\u062a\u0647 \u0648\u0623\u0646\u062a \u062a\u0639\u0644\u0645 \u0623\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062b\u0628\u062a \u063a\u064a\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0630\u064a \u0644\u0645 \u064a\u062b\u0628\u062a \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0645\u0642\u0631\u0628\u0647 \u063a\u064a\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0630\u064a \u0644\u0645 \u064a\u0642\u0631\u0628\u0647 \u0641\u0625\u0630\u0646 \u0644\u0644\u0630\u0627\u062a \u0627\u0644\u062a\u064a \u0623\u062b\u0628\u062a \u0648\u062c\u0648\u062f\u0647\u0627 \u062e\u0627\u0635\u064a\u0629 \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0623\u0646\u0647\u0627 \u0647\u0648 \u0628\u0639\u064a\u0646\u0647 \u063a\u064a\u0631 \u062c\u0633\u0645\u0647 \u0648\u0623\u0639\u0636\u0627\u0626\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u064a \u0644\u0645 \u062a\u062b\u0628\u062a \u0641\u0625\u0630\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062b\u0628\u062a \u0644\u0647 \u0633\u0628\u064a\u0644 \u0625\u0644\u0649 \u0623\u0646 \u064a\u062b\u0628\u062a\u0647 \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0648\u062c\u0648\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0646\u0641\u0633 \u0634\u064a\u0626\u0627\u064b \u063a\u064a\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u062c\u0633\u0645 \u0628\u0644 \u063a\u064a\u0631 \u062c\u0633\u0645 \u0648\u0623\u0646\u0647 \u0639\u0627\u0631\u0641 \u0628\u0647 \u0645\u0633\u062a\u0634\u0639\u0631 \u0644\u0647 \u0648\u0625\u0646 \u0643\u0627\u0646 \u0630\u0627\u0647\u0644\u0627\u064b \u0639\u0646\u0647 \u064a\u062d\u062a\u0627\u062c \u0625\u0644\u0649 \u0623\u0646 \u064a\u0642\u0631\u0639 \u0639\u0635\u0627\u0647.}}|Ibn Sina|Kitab Al-Shifa, On the Soul}}</ref>}}\n\nHowever, Avicenna posited the brain as the place where reason interacts with sensation.

He discusses Aristotle's ''[[Posterior Analytics]]'' and significantly diverged from it on several points. Avicenna discussed the issue of a proper methodology for scientific inquiry and the question of \"How does one acquire the first principles of a science?\" He asked how a scientist would arrive at \"the initial [[axiom]]s or [[hypothesis|hypotheses]] of a [[deductive reasoning|deductive]] science without inferring them from some more basic premises?\" He explains that the ideal situation is when one grasps that a \"relation holds between the terms, which would allow for absolute, universal certainty\". Avicenna then adds two further methods for arriving at the [[first principle]]s: the ancient Aristotelian method of [[inductive reasoning|induction]] (''istiqra''), and the method of [[Hypothesis|examination]] and [[experiment]]ation (''tajriba''). Avicenna criticized Aristotelian induction, arguing that \"it does not lead to the absolute, universal, and certain premises that it purports to provide.\" In its place, he develops a \"method of experimentation as a means for scientific inquiry.\"<ref>{{Cite journal |last=McGinnis |first=Jon |date=July 2003 |title=Scientific Methodologies in Medieval Islam |url=https://irl.umsl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1003&context=philosophy-faculty |journal=Journal of the History of Philosophy |volume=41 |issue=3 |pages=307\u2013327 |doi=10.1353/hph.2003.0033}}</ref>\n\n=== Logic ===\nAn early formal system of [[temporal logic]] was studied by Avicenna.<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/ebc/article-65928 History of logic: Arabic logic], ''[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]''.</ref> Although he did not develop a real theory of temporal propositions, he did study the relationship between ''temporalis'' and the implication.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Temporal Logic: From Ancient Ideas to Artificial Intelligence |last=Peter \u00d8hrstr\u00f8m |last2=Per Hasle |publisher=Springer |year=1995 |page=72}}</ref> Avicenna's work was further developed by [[Najm al-D\u012bn al-Qazw\u012bn\u012b al-K\u0101tib\u012b]] and became the dominant system of [[Logic in Islamic philosophy|Islamic logic]] until modern times.<ref>{{Citation |last=Tony Street |title=Toward a History of Syllogistic After Avicenna: Notes on Rescher's Studies on Arabic Modal Logic |journal=Journal of Islamic Studies |volume=11 |issue=2 |pages=209\u2013228 |year=2000 |doi=10.1093/jis/11.2.209}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |title=The Cambridge Companion to Arabic Philosophy |last=Street |first=Tony |date=2005-01-01 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-52069-0 |editor-last=Peter Adamson |pages=247\u2013265 |chapter=Logic |editor-last2=Richard C.

Avicenna grounds his psychology on physiology, which means his account of the soul is one that deals almost entirely with the natural science of the body and its abilities of perception. Thus, the philosopher's connection between the soul and body is explained almost entirely by his understanding of perception; in this way, bodily perception interrelates with the immaterial human intellect. In sense perception, the perceiver senses the form of the object; first, by perceiving features of the object by our external senses. This sensory information is supplied to the internal senses, which merge all the pieces into a whole, unified conscious experience. This process of perception and abstraction is the nexus of the soul and body, for the material body may only perceive material objects, while the immaterial soul may only receive the immaterial, universal forms. The way the soul and body interact in the final abstraction of the universal from the concrete particular is the key to their relationship and interaction, which takes place in the physical body.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Avicenna's Psychology.

Ibn Sina's chief reward for this service was access to the royal library of the Samanids, well-known patrons of scholarship and scholars. When the library was destroyed by fire not long after, the enemies of Ibn Sina accused him of burning it, in order for ever to conceal the sources of his knowledge. Meanwhile, he assisted his father in his financial labors, but still found time to write some of his earliest works.<ref name=\"EB1911\" />\n\nAt 22 years old, Avicenna lost his father. The Samanid dynasty came to its end in December 1004. Avicenna seems to have declined the offers of [[Mahmud of Ghazni]], and proceeded westwards to [[Konye-Urgench|Urgench]] in modern [[Turkmenistan]], where the [[vizier]], regarded as a friend of scholars, gave him a small monthly stipend. The pay was small, however, so Ibn Sina wandered from place to place through the districts of [[Nishapur]] and [[Merv]] to the borders of [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]], seeking an opening for his talents. [[Qabus]], the generous ruler of [[Tabaristan]], himself a poet and a scholar, with whom Ibn Sina had expected to find asylum, was on about that date (1012) starved to death by his troops who had revolted. Avicenna himself was at this time stricken by a severe illness. Finally, at [[Gorgan]], near the [[Caspian Sea]], Avicenna met with a friend, who bought a dwelling near his own house in which Avicenna lectured on [[logic]] and [[astronomy]]. Several of his treatises were written for this patron; and the commencement of his ''Canon of Medicine'' also dates from his stay in [[Hyrcania]].<ref name=\"EB1911\" />\n\nAvicenna subsequently settled at [[Rey, Iran|Rey]], in the vicinity of modern [[Tehran]], the home town of [[Al-Razi|Rhazes]]; where [[Abu Taleb Rostam|Majd Addaula]], a son of the last [[Buwayhid]] emir, was nominal ruler under the regency of his mother ([[Seyyedeh Khatun]]). About thirty of Ibn Sina's shorter works are said to have been composed in Rey. Constant feuds which raged between the regent and her second son, [[Shams al-Daula]], however, compelled the scholar to quit the place. After a brief sojourn at [[Qazvin (city)|Qazvin]] he passed southwards to Hamad\u00e3n where Shams al-Daula, another Buwayhid emir, had established himself. At first, Ibn Sina entered into the service of a high-born lady; but the emir, hearing of his arrival, called him in as medical attendant, and sent him back with presents to his dwelling. Ibn Sina was even raised to the office of vizier. The emir decreed that he should be banished from the country. Ibn Sina, however, remained hidden for forty days in sheikh Ahmed Fadhel's house, until a fresh attack of illness induced the emir to restore him to his post. Even during this perturbed time, Ibn Sina persevered with his studies and teaching. Every evening, extracts from his great works, the ''Canon'' and the ''Sanatio'', were dictated and explained to his pupils. On the death of the emir, Ibn Sina ceased to be vizier and hid himself in the house of an [[apothecary]], where, with intense assiduity, he continued the composition of his works.<ref name=\"EB1911\" />\n\nMeanwhile, he had written to Abu Ya'far, the prefect of the dynamic city of [[Isfahan]], offering his services. The new emir of Hamadan, hearing of this correspondence and discovering where Ibn Sina was hiding, incarcerated him in a fortress. War meanwhile continued between the rulers of Isfahan and Hamad\u00e3n; in 1024 the former captured Hamadan and its towns, expelling the Tajik mercenaries. When the storm had passed, Ibn Sina returned with the emir to Hamadan, and carried on his literary labors. Later, however, accompanied by his brother, a favorite pupil, and two slaves, Ibn Sina escaped from the city in the dress of a [[Sufi]] [[ascetic]]. After a perilous journey, they reached Isfahan, receiving an honorable welcome from the prince.<ref name=\"EB1911\" />\n\n=== Later life and death ===\n[[File:Avicenna canon 1597.jpg|thumb|upright|The first page of a manuscript of Avicenna's ''Canon'', dated 1596/7 (Yale, Medical Historical Library, Cushing Arabic ms. 5)]]\nThe remaining ten or twelve years of Ibn S\u012bn\u0101's life were spent in the service of the [[Kakuyid]] ruler [[Muhammad ibn Rustam Dushmanziyar]] (also known as Ala al-Dawla), whom he accompanied as physician and general literary and scientific adviser, even in his numerous campaigns.<ref name=\"EB1911\" />\n\nDuring these years he began to study literary matters and [[philology]], instigated, it is asserted, by criticisms on his style. A severe [[colic]], which seized him on the march of the army against Hamadan, was checked by remedies so violent that Ibn Sina could scarcely stand. On a similar occasion the disease returned; with difficulty he reached Hamadan, where, finding the disease gaining ground, he refused to keep up the regimen imposed, and resigned himself to his fate.<ref name=\"EB1911\" />\n\nHis friends advised him to slow down and take life moderately.

Whereas existence is the domain of the contingent and the accidental, essence endures within a being beyond the accidental. The philosophy of Ibn S\u012bn\u0101, particularly that part relating to metaphysics, owes much to al-Farabi. The search for a definitive Islamic philosophy separate from [[Occasionalism]] can be seen in what is left of his work.\n\nFollowing al-Farabi's lead, Avicenna initiated a full-fledged inquiry into the question of being, in which he distinguished between essence (''Mahiat'') and existence (''Wujud''). He argued that the fact of existence cannot be inferred from or accounted for by the essence of existing things, and that form and matter by themselves cannot interact and originate the movement of the universe or the progressive actualization of existing things. Existence must, therefore, be due to an [[Causality|agent-cause]] that necessitates, imparts, gives, or adds existence to an essence. To do so, the cause must be an existing thing and coexist with its effect.<ref name=\"Islam in Britannica\">{{Cite encyclopedia |year=2007 |title=Islam |encyclopedia=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Online |url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-69190/Islam |accessdate=2007-11-27 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071222082832/http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-69190/Islam |archivedate=22 December 2007 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nAvicenna's consideration of the essence-attributes question may be elucidated in terms of his ontological analysis of the modalities of being; namely impossibility, contingency, and necessity. Avicenna argued that the impossible being is that which cannot exist, while the contingent in itself (''mumkin bi-dhatihi'') has the potentiality to be or not to be without entailing a contradiction. When actualized, the contingent becomes a 'necessary existent due to what is other than itself' (''wajib al-wujud bi-ghayrihi''). Thus, contingency-in-itself is potential beingness that could eventually be actualized by an external cause other than itself. The metaphysical structures of necessity and contingency are different. Necessary being due to itself (''wajib al-wujud bi-dhatihi'') is true in itself, while the contingent being is 'false in itself' and 'true due to something else other than itself'. The necessary is the source of its own being without borrowed existence. It is what always exists.<ref>Avicenna, ''Kitab al-shifa', Metaphysics II'', (eds.) G.C.

In general these treatises linked his philosophical writings to Islamic religious ideas; for example, the body's afterlife.\n\nThere are occasional brief hints and allusions in his longer works however that Avicenna considered philosophy as the only sensible way to distinguish real prophecy from illusion. He did not state this more clearly because of the political implications of such a theory, if prophecy could be questioned, and also because most of the time he was writing shorter works which concentrated on explaining his theories on philosophy and theology clearly, without digressing to consider [[epistemological]] matters which could only be properly considered by other philosophers.<ref>James W.

It was the theological interpretation championed by those such as al-Razi which eventually came to predominate in the [[madrasahs]].<ref>James W.

One of these texts included the ''Proof of Prophecies'', in which he comments on several Quranic verses and holds the Quran in high esteem. Avicenna argued that the Islamic prophets should be considered higher than philosophers.<ref>Jules Janssens (2004), \"Avicenna and the Qur'an: A Survey of his Qur'anic commentaries\", ''MIDEO'' '''25''', p.&nbsp;177\u2013192.</ref> \n\n=== Thought experiments ===\n{{Main|Floating man}}\nWhile he was imprisoned in the castle of Fardajan near Hamadhan, Avicenna wrote his famous \"[[floating man|Floating Man]]\"&nbsp;\u2013 literally falling man&nbsp;\u2013 [[thought experiment]] to demonstrate human [[self-awareness]] and the substantiality and immateriality of the soul. Avicenna believed his \"Floating Man\" thought experiment demonstrated that the soul is a substance, and claimed humans cannot doubt their own consciousness, even in a situation that prevents all sensory data input. The thought experiment told its readers to imagine themselves created all at once while suspended in the air, isolated from all [[Wikt:sensation|sensations]], which includes no sensory contact with even their own bodies. He argued that, in this scenario, one would still have [[self-consciousness]]. Because it is conceivable that a person, suspended in air while cut off from [[empirical evidence|sense experience]], would still be capable of determining his own existence, the thought experiment points to the conclusions that the soul is a perfection, independent of the body, and an immaterial substance.<ref>See a discussion of this in connection with an analytic take on the philosophy of mind in: [[Nader El-Bizri]], 'Avicenna and the Problem of Consciousness', in ''Consciousness and the Great Philosophers'', eds. S. Leach and J. Tartaglia (London: Routledge, 2016), 45\u201353</ref> The conceivability of this \"Floating Man\" indicates that the soul is perceived intellectually, which entails the soul's separateness from the body. Avicenna referred to the living human [[nous|intelligence]], particularly the [[active intellect]], which he believed to be the [[hypostatic abstraction|hypostasis]] by which God communicates [[truth]] to the human mind and imparts order and intelligibility to nature. Following is an English translation of the argument:\n\n{{quote|One of us (i.e. a human being) should be imagined as having been created in a single stroke; created perfect and complete but with his vision obscured so that he cannot perceive external entities; created falling through air or a void, in such a manner that he is not struck by the firmness of the air in any way that compels him to feel it, and with his limbs separated so that they do not come in contact with or touch each other. Then contemplate the following: can he be assured of the existence of himself? He does not have any doubt in that his self exists, without thereby asserting that he has any exterior limbs, nor any internal organs, neither heart nor brain, nor any one of the exterior things at all; but rather he can affirm the existence of himself, without thereby asserting there that this self has any extension in space. Even if it were possible for him in that state to imagine a hand or any other limb, he would not imagine it as being a part of his self, nor as a condition for the existence of that self; for as you know that which is asserted is different from that which is not asserted and that which is inferred is different from that which is not inferred. Therefore the self, the existence of which has been asserted, is a unique characteristic, in as much that it is not as such the same as the body or the limbs, which have not been ascertained. Thus that which is ascertained (i.e. the self), does have a way of being sure of the existence of the soul as something other than the body, even something non-bodily; this he knows, this he should understand intuitively, if it is that he is ignorant of it and needs to be beaten with a stick [to realize it].|Ibn Sina|Kitab Al-Shifa, On the Soul<ref name=\"Nader El-Bizri 2000\" /><ref>Ibn Sina, ''\u0627\u0644\u0641\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0627\u062f\u0633 \u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0637\u0628\u064a\u0639\u064a\u0627\u062a \u0645\u0646 \u0643\u062a\u0627\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u0634\u0641\u0627\u0621 \u0627\u0644\u0642\u0633\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0648\u0644'' (Beirut, Lebanon.: M.A.J.D Enterprise Universitaire d'Etude et de Publication S.A.R.L)\n{{quote|{{lang|ar|\u064a\u062c\u0628 \u0623\u0646 \u064a\u062a\u0648\u0647\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0648\u0627\u062d\u062f \u0645\u0646\u0627 \u0643\u0623\u0646\u0647 \u062e\u0644\u0642 \u062f\u0641\u0639\u0629\u064b \u0648\u062e\u0644\u0642 \u0643\u0627\u0645\u0644\u0627\u064b \u0644\u0643\u0646\u0647 \u062d\u062c\u0628 \u0628\u0635\u0631\u0647 \u0639\u0646 \u0645\u0634\u0627\u0647\u062f\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u062e\u0627\u0631\u062c\u0627\u062a \u0648\u062e\u0644\u0642 \u064a\u0647\u0648\u0649 \u0641\u064a \u0647\u0648\u0627\u0621 \u0623\u0648 \u062e\u0644\u0627\u0621 \u0647\u0648\u064a\u0627\u064b \u0644\u0627 \u064a\u0635\u062f\u0645\u0647 \u0641\u064a\u0647 \u0642\u0648\u0627\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0647\u0648\u0627\u0621 \u0635\u062f\u0645\u0627\u064b \u0645\u0627 \u064a\u062d\u0648\u062c \u0625\u0644\u0649 \u0623\u0646 \u064a\u062d\u0633 \u0648\u0641\u0631\u0642 \u0628\u064a\u0646 \u0623\u0639\u0636\u0627\u0626\u0647 \u0641\u0644\u0645 \u062a\u062a\u0644\u0627\u0642 \u0648\u0644\u0645 \u062a\u062a\u0645\u0627\u0633 \u062b\u0645 \u064a\u062a\u0623\u0645\u0644 \u0647\u0644 \u0623\u0646\u0647 \u064a\u062b\u0628\u062a \u0648\u062c\u0648\u062f \u0630\u0627\u062a\u0647 \u0648\u0644\u0627 \u064a\u0634\u0643\u0643 \u0641\u064a \u0625\u062b\u0628\u0627\u062a\u0647 \u0644\u0630\u0627\u062a\u0647 \u0645\u0648\u062c\u0648\u062f\u0627\u064b \u0648\u0644\u0627 \u064a\u062b\u0628\u062a \u0645\u0639 \u0630\u0644\u0643 \u0637\u0631\u0641\u0627\u064b \u0645\u0646 \u0623\u0639\u0636\u0627\u0626\u0647 \u0648\u0644\u0627 \u0628\u0627\u0637\u0646\u0627\u064b \u0645\u0646 \u0623\u062d\u0634\u0627\u0626\u0647 \u0648\u0644\u0627 \u0642\u0644\u0628\u0627\u064b \u0648\u0644\u0627 \u062f\u0645\u0627\u063a\u0627\u064b \u0648\u0644\u0627 \u0634\u064a\u0626\u0627\u064b \u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0634\u064a\u0627\u0621 \u0645\u0646 \u062e\u0627\u0631\u062c \u0628\u0644 \u0643\u0627\u0646 \u064a\u062b\u0628\u062a \u0630\u0627\u062a\u0647 \u0648\u0644\u0627 \u064a\u062b\u0628\u062a \u0644\u0647\u0627 \u0637\u0648\u0644\u0627\u064b \u0648\u0644\u0627 \u0639\u0631\u0636\u0627\u064b \u0648\u0644\u0627 \u0639\u0645\u0642\u0627\u064b \u0648\u0644\u0648 \u0623\u0646\u0647 \u0623\u0645\u0643\u0646\u0647 \u0641\u064a \u062a\u0644\u0643 \u0627\u0644\u062d\u0627\u0644\u0629 \u0623\u0646 \u064a\u062a\u062e\u064a\u0644 \u064a\u062f\u0627\u064b \u0623\u0648 \u0639\u0636\u0648\u0627\u064b \u0622\u062e\u0631  \u0644\u0645 \u064a\u062a\u062e\u064a\u0644\u0647 \u062c\u0632\u0621 \u0645\u0646 \u0630\u0627\u062a\u0647 \u0648\u0644\u0627  \u0634\u0631\u0637\u0627\u064b \u0641\u064a \u0630\u0627\u062a\u0647 \u0648\u0623\u0646\u062a \u062a\u0639\u0644\u0645 \u0623\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062b\u0628\u062a \u063a\u064a\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0630\u064a \u0644\u0645 \u064a\u062b\u0628\u062a \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0645\u0642\u0631\u0628\u0647 \u063a\u064a\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0630\u064a \u0644\u0645 \u064a\u0642\u0631\u0628\u0647 \u0641\u0625\u0630\u0646 \u0644\u0644\u0630\u0627\u062a \u0627\u0644\u062a\u064a \u0623\u062b\u0628\u062a \u0648\u062c\u0648\u062f\u0647\u0627 \u062e\u0627\u0635\u064a\u0629 \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0623\u0646\u0647\u0627 \u0647\u0648 \u0628\u0639\u064a\u0646\u0647 \u063a\u064a\u0631 \u062c\u0633\u0645\u0647 \u0648\u0623\u0639\u0636\u0627\u0626\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u064a \u0644\u0645 \u062a\u062b\u0628\u062a \u0641\u0625\u0630\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062b\u0628\u062a \u0644\u0647 \u0633\u0628\u064a\u0644 \u0625\u0644\u0649 \u0623\u0646 \u064a\u062b\u0628\u062a\u0647 \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0648\u062c\u0648\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0646\u0641\u0633 \u0634\u064a\u0626\u0627\u064b \u063a\u064a\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u062c\u0633\u0645 \u0628\u0644 \u063a\u064a\u0631 \u062c\u0633\u0645 \u0648\u0623\u0646\u0647 \u0639\u0627\u0631\u0641 \u0628\u0647 \u0645\u0633\u062a\u0634\u0639\u0631 \u0644\u0647 \u0648\u0625\u0646 \u0643\u0627\u0646 \u0630\u0627\u0647\u0644\u0627\u064b \u0639\u0646\u0647 \u064a\u062d\u062a\u0627\u062c \u0625\u0644\u0649 \u0623\u0646 \u064a\u0642\u0631\u0639 \u0639\u0635\u0627\u0647.}}|Ibn Sina|Kitab Al-Shifa, On the Soul}}</ref>}}\n\nHowever, Avicenna posited the brain as the place where reason interacts with sensation.

Avicenna discussed the issue of a proper methodology for scientific inquiry and the question of \"How does one acquire the first principles of a science?\" He asked how a scientist would arrive at \"the initial [[axiom]]s or [[hypothesis|hypotheses]] of a [[deductive reasoning|deductive]] science without inferring them from some more basic premises?\" He explains that the ideal situation is when one grasps that a \"relation holds between the terms, which would allow for absolute, universal certainty\". Avicenna then adds two further methods for arriving at the [[first principle]]s: the ancient Aristotelian method of [[inductive reasoning|induction]] (''istiqra''), and the method of [[Hypothesis|examination]] and [[experiment]]ation (''tajriba''). Avicenna criticized Aristotelian induction, arguing that \"it does not lead to the absolute, universal, and certain premises that it purports to provide.\" In its place, he develops a \"method of experimentation as a means for scientific inquiry.\"<ref>{{Cite journal |last=McGinnis |first=Jon |date=July 2003 |title=Scientific Methodologies in Medieval Islam |url=https://irl.umsl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1003&context=philosophy-faculty |journal=Journal of the History of Philosophy |volume=41 |issue=3 |pages=307\u2013327 |doi=10.1353/hph.2003.0033}}</ref>\n\n=== Logic ===\nAn early formal system of [[temporal logic]] was studied by Avicenna.<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/ebc/article-65928 History of logic: Arabic logic], ''[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]''.</ref> Although he did not develop a real theory of temporal propositions, he did study the relationship between ''temporalis'' and the implication.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Temporal Logic: From Ancient Ideas to Artificial Intelligence |last=Peter \u00d8hrstr\u00f8m |last2=Per Hasle |publisher=Springer |year=1995 |page=72}}</ref> Avicenna's work was further developed by [[Najm al-D\u012bn al-Qazw\u012bn\u012b al-K\u0101tib\u012b]] and became the dominant system of [[Logic in Islamic philosophy|Islamic logic]] until modern times.<ref>{{Citation |last=Tony Street |title=Toward a History of Syllogistic After Avicenna: Notes on Rescher's Studies on Arabic Modal Logic |journal=Journal of Islamic Studies |volume=11 |issue=2 |pages=209\u2013228 |year=2000 |doi=10.1093/jis/11.2.209}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |title=The Cambridge Companion to Arabic Philosophy |last=Street |first=Tony |date=2005-01-01 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-52069-0 |editor-last=Peter Adamson |pages=247\u2013265 |chapter=Logic |editor-last2=Richard C.

Avicenna grounds his psychology on physiology, which means his account of the soul is one that deals almost entirely with the natural science of the body and its abilities of perception. Thus, the philosopher's connection between the soul and body is explained almost entirely by his understanding of perception; in this way, bodily perception interrelates with the immaterial human intellect. In sense perception, the perceiver senses the form of the object; first, by perceiving features of the object by our external senses. This sensory information is supplied to the internal senses, which merge all the pieces into a whole, unified conscious experience. This process of perception and abstraction is the nexus of the soul and body, for the material body may only perceive material objects, while the immaterial soul may only receive the immaterial, universal forms. The way the soul and body interact in the final abstraction of the universal from the concrete particular is the key to their relationship and interaction, which takes place in the physical body.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Avicenna's Psychology.

The novel was adapted into a feature film, ''[[The Physician (2013 film)|The Physician]]'', in 2013. Avicenna was played by [[Ben Kingsley]].\n\n== Arabic works ==\nThe treatises of Ibn S\u012bn\u0101 influenced later Muslim thinkers in many areas including theology, philology, mathematics, astronomy, physics, and music. His works numbered almost 450 volumes on a wide range of subjects, of which around 240 have survived. In particular, 150 volumes of his surviving works concentrate on philosophy and 40 of them concentrate on medicine.<ref name=\"MacTutor Biography|id=Avicenna\" />\nHis most famous works are ''The Book of Healing'', and ''The Canon of Medicine''.\n\nIbn S\u012bn\u0101 wrote at least one treatise on alchemy, but several others have been falsely attributed to him.  His ''Logic'', ''Metaphysics'', ''Physics'', and ''De Caelo'', are treatises giving a synoptic view of [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian doctrine]],<ref name=\"EB1911\" /> though  ''Metaphysics'' demonstrates a significant departure from the brand of [[Neoplatonism]] known as Aristotelianism in Ibn S\u012bn\u0101's world;\nArabic philosophers{{who|date=February 2015}}{{year needed|date=February 2015}} have hinted at the idea that Ibn S\u012bn\u0101 was attempting to \"re-Aristotelianise\" Muslim philosophy in its entirety, unlike his predecessors, who accepted the conflation of Platonic, Aristotelian, Neo- and Middle-Platonic works transmitted into the Muslim world.\n\nThe ''Logic'' and ''Metaphysics'' have been extensively reprinted, the latter, e.g., at Venice in 1493, 1495, and 1546. Some of his shorter essays on medicine, logic, etc., take a poetical form (the poem on logic was published by Schmoelders in 1836).<ref>Thought Experiments: Popular Thought Experiments in Philosophy, Physics, Ethics, Computer Science & Mathematics by Fredrick Kennard, p. 115</ref> Two encyclopedic treatises, dealing with philosophy, are often mentioned. The larger, ''[[The Book of Healing|Al-Shifa']]'' (''Sanatio''), exists nearly complete in manuscript in the [[Bodleian Library]] and elsewhere; part of it on the ''De Anima'' appeared at Pavia (1490) as the ''Liber Sextus Naturalium'', and the long account of Ibn Sina's philosophy given by [[Muhammad al-Shahrastani]] seems to be mainly an analysis, and in many places a reproduction, of the Al-Shifa'. A shorter form of the work is known as the An-najat (''Liberatio'').

After a drawn first Test, England won the next two matches before being awarded the final match in controversial circumstances; on the fourth day, Pakistan's players were penalised for [[ball tampering]] and refused to resume play after the tea interval, leading the umpires to award England the match and a 3\u20130 series victory. In 2008, the ICC controversially declared the result of the final Test as a draw, altering the scoreline to 2\u20130; however, after criticism, not least by the MCC, this was subsequently reversed in February 2009 and the result restored as an England victory.<ref name=\"BBC Sport\">{{cite news |title=Result U-turn for 2006 Oval Test |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/cricket/7863464.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=1 February 2009 |accessdate=1 February 2009 }}</ref>\n\n\n\n==Background==\n[[England cricket team|England]] had [[English cricket team in Pakistan in 2005\u201306|toured Pakistan]] the previous winter, with Pakistan winning the three-match Test series 2\u20130 and the five-match ODI series 3\u20132.

[[Kevin Pietersen]] was the next man out, adding just 28 runs for the third wicket, but [[Alastair Cook]] and [[Paul Collingwood]] both reached centuries on the way to a fourth-wicket partnership of 233 runs before Cook was out for 105. Collingwood top-scored in the innings with 186, and [[Ian Bell]] also managed an unbeaten 100 before England immediately declared on 528/9 with half a session left in the second day's play.\n\n[[Steve Harmison]] took two wickets in three balls before the close of play, helping England reduce Pakistan to 68/4 early on the third day; however, [[Mohammad Yousuf (cricketer)|Mohammad Yousuf]] and captain [[Inzamam-ul-Haq]] added 173 runs for the fifth wicket, and [[Kamran Akmal]] also made a half-century, reaching 58 before he was caught behind off the bowling of [[Kevin Pietersen]]. Despite partners falling around him, [[Mohammad Yousuf (cricketer)|Mohammad Yousuf]] managed to bat on to a double-century before he was caught behind off Harmison to close the innings \u2013 Harmison finished with figures of 4/94.\n\nEngland began the process of building on their 83-run lead early on the fourth day, but Strauss' 128 was the only notable score as they amassed 296 runs before declaring early on the final day, giving Pakistan a target of 380 to chase in 73 overs. [[Salman Butt]] fell to the first ball of the innings from Hoggard, followed by [[Imran Farhat]] to leave the tourists at 33/2; however, scores of 48 from [[Faisal Iqbal]] and Mohammad Yousuf got them to 141/4, before Inzamam-ul-Haq and [[Abdul Razzaq (Pakistani cricket player)|Abdul Razzaq]] batted out the last session for 73 to secure a draw.\n\n===2nd Test===\n{{Test match\n| date = 27\u201329 July 2006\n| team1 = {{cr-rt|PAK}}\n| team2 = {{cr|ENG}}\n| score-team1-inns1 = 119 (38.4 overs)\n| runs-team1-inns1 = [[Younis Khan]] 44 (62)\n| wickets-team1-inns1 = [[Steve Harmison]] 6/19 (13 overs)\n| score-team2-inns1 = 461/9[[Declaration and forfeiture|d]] (133 overs)\n| runs-team2-inns1 = [[Alastair Cook]] 127 (260)\n| wickets-team2-inns1 = [[Umar Gul]] 3/96 (28 overs)\n| score-team1-inns2 = 222 (67.1 overs)\n| runs-team1-inns2 = [[Younis Khan]] 62 (119)\n| wickets-team1-inns2 = [[Steve Harmison]] 5/57 (18.1 overs)\n| score-team2-inns2 = \n| runs-team2-inns2 = \n| wickets-team2-inns2 = \n| result = England won by an innings and 120 runs\n| report = [http://www.espncricinfo.com/engvpak/engine/match/225256.html Scorecard]\n| venue = [[Old Trafford Cricket Ground|Old Trafford]], Manchester\n| umpires = [[Simon Taufel]] (Aus) and [[Steve Bucknor]] (WI)\n| motm = [[Steve Harmison]] (Eng)\n| toss = Pakistan won the toss and elected to bat.\n}}\nWith [[Inzamam-ul-Haq]]'s run of half-centuries against England finally stopped, as he was caught by [[Kevin Pietersen]] off [[Steve Harmison]]'s bowling for a duck, England recorded an innings victory over Pakistan to take a 1\u20130 lead into the third Test. In the first innings, Pakistan lost the last eight wickets for 29 to post 119 with no batsmen making a half-century; England surpassed that score for the loss of two wickets, and with [[Alastair Cook]] and [[Ian Bell]] both making hundreds (127 and 106* respectively), England could eventually declare near the end of day two having made 461. It took England 63 overs to clean up, with Harmison and [[Monty Panesar]] sharing the ten wickets evenly (the only wicket takers in both innings) with the help of wicket keeper [[Geraint Jones]], who caught five despite his fractured finger. Panesar took his second five-wicket-haul in three months, and was praised by opposition coach [[Bob Woolmer]].<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/cricket/england/5229112.stm Panesar tipped for greatness], from BBC, retrieved 31 July 2006</ref>\n\n===3rd Test===\n{{Test match\n| date = 4\u20138 August 2006\n| team1 = {{cr-rt|ENG}}\n| team2 = {{cr|PAK}}\n| score-team1-inns1 = 515 (123 overs)\n| runs-team1-inns1 = [[Kevin Pietersen]] 135 (169)\n| wickets-team1-inns1 = [[Umar Gul]] 5/123 (29 overs)\n| score-team2-inns1 = 538 (141.4 overs)\n| runs-team2-inns1 = [[Mohammad Yousuf (cricketer, born 1974)|Mohammad Yousuf]] 192 (261)\n| wickets-team2-inns1 = [[Monty Panesar]] 3/127 (47.4 overs)\n| score-team1-inns2 = 345 (88.3 overs)\n| runs-team1-inns2 = [[Andrew Strauss]] 116 (171)\n| wickets-team1-inns2 = [[Shahid Nazir]] 3/32 (14 overs)\n| score-team2-inns2 = 155 (47.5 overs)\n| runs-team2-inns2 = [[Younis Khan]] 41 (83)\n| wickets-team2-inns2 = [[Sajid Mahmood]] 4/22 (8 overs)\n| result = England won by 167 runs\n| report = [http://www.espncricinfo.com/engvpak/engine/match/225257.html Scorecard]\n| venue = [[Headingley Stadium|Headingley]], Leeds\n| umpires = [[Billy Doctrove]] (WI) and [[Darrell Hair]] (Aus)\n| motm = [[Younis Khan]] (Pak)\n| toss = England won the toss and elected to bat.\n}}\nAfter their innings defeat in the second test, Pakistan dropped [[Shahid Afridi]] and [[Abdul Razzaq (Pakistani cricket player)|Abdul Razzaq]], and had to swap [[Imran Farhat]] out due to injury. They brought in [[Salman Butt]] and [[Taufeeq Umar]] to open the innings, plus the bowling of [[Shahid Nazir]]. England only made one change, which was to swap the struggling wicketkeeper [[Geraint Jones]] for [[Chris Read]]. The wicketkeeper position had been the subject of much debate. Read was perceived as the better keeper, although Jones\u2019 batting skills were considered to be superior. However, Jones had not scored a significant innings for some time and Read was given an opportunity to impress for the first time since the West Indies tour of 2004.\n\nThe first day of the test prompted some interesting incidents as England won the toss and batted first. In the morning, there were three rogue decisions from the umpires (who had been testing the use of earpieces to communicate with off-field officials); in the afternoon Kevin Pietersen left the field in bizarre circumstances, and Pakistan responded with 11 overs of very mediocre bowling, using their opening batsmen to bowl during the period before the second new ball was due.\n\nIn amongst all this, Pietersen scored his 5th test century, and helped propel England to 347/6 by the end of the day. England continued on day 2, with [[Ian Bell]] posting his third consecutive test century, and the lower order added useful runs before England were bowled out for 515.\n\nPakistan's openers once again struggled, and they fell quickly to leave the tourists on 36/2. However, the experienced combination of [[Younis Khan]] and [[Mohammad Yousuf (cricket)|Mohammad Yousuf]] then combined to produce the largest partnership for Pakistan against England of 363 for the third wicket. They batted well into the afternoon session of the third day, before Yousuf gloved [[Stephen Harmison]] through to the keeper having scored 192.\n\nPakistan then lost some of their advantage in a bizarre passage of play leading up to the tea interval. Younis was run out on 173, [[Faisal Iqbal]] fell lbw to his first delivery faced (giving [[Paul Collingwood]] his first test wicket), and [[Inzamam-ul-Haq]] lost his wicket in a comical way, overbalancing while attempting to sweep a [[Monty Panesar]] delivery and falling onto his stumps.\n\nThe lower order batsmen tried to accelerate the scoring, but lost regular wickets in the process, and Pakistan were finally bowled out for 538.\n\nEngland's second innings started well, with the openers putting on 158 for the first wicket. [[Andrew Strauss]] went on to score 116, and [[Chris Read]] scored 55 down the order, but the other wickets fell quite regularly as England attempted to set up a position where they could push for a win on the final day. Pakistan's bowling attack shared the wickets between them, and eventually bowled England out for 345. Pakistan needed 323 runs on the final day to win.\n\nEngland's bowlers performed well on the final day, and took 5 wickets in the first session ensuring the 323 run target was well out of Pakistan's reach. The run out of [[Mohammad Yousuf (cricket)|Mohammad Yousuf]] for a single figure score was a key moment in the innings \u2013 in fact, Pakistan lost 3 of their top order batsmen to run outs during the game. [[Sajid Mahmood]] struck twice in an over shortly before lunch to remove [[Faisal Iqbal]] and [[Kamran Akmal]], and would go on to record test best figures of 4/22.\n\n[[Monty Panesar]] also demonstrated his promising talent, taking 3 wickets in the second innings to follow up on 3 wickets in the first, on a pitch not typically associated with assisting spinners. His dismissal of [[Younis Khan]] during the afternoon session was spectacular, with a wonderfully flighted delivery that just clipped the bail of the off stump.\n\nFrom this point, it was a matter of time before England took the honours.\n\nAs a result of a rib injury obtained during the course of the Test (and determined to be an ''internal'' injury rather than an ''external'' one<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/cricket/england/5253966.stm | work=BBC News | title=Rib injury keeps Inzamam waiting | date=7 August 2006}}</ref>) the Pakistan Captain, [[Inzamam-ul-Haq]], was unable to bat for 4h20m in the Pakistan 2nd innings, or until the fall of the 5th wicket (whichever came first). As England took five wickets in the first session of the last day, he was able to come in at number 7 in the order. His wicket was eventually the last to fall, being stumped off the bowling of [[Monty Panesar]], and Pakistan were all out for 155.\n\nEngland won the match by 167 runs, and took an unassailable 2\u20130 lead in the series, with one left to play.\n\n===4th Test===\n{{main|2006 ball-tampering controversy}}\n{{Test match\n| date = 17\u201320 August 2006\n| team1 = {{cr-rt|ENG}}\n| team2 = {{cr|PAK}}\n| score-team1-inns1 = 173 (53.2 overs)\n| runs-team1-inns1 = [[Alastair Cook]] 40 (69)\n| wickets-team1-inns1 = [[Umar Gul]] 4/46 (15.2 overs)\n| score-team2-inns1 = 504 (129.5 overs)\n| runs-team2-inns1 = [[Mohammad Yousuf (cricketer, born 1974)|Mohammad Yousuf]] 128 (236)\n| wickets-team2-inns1 = [[Monty Panesar|MS Panesar]] 4/125 (30.5 overs)\n| score-team1-inns2 = 298/4 (72 overs)\n| runs-team1-inns2 = [[Kevin Pietersen]] 96 (114)\n| wickets-team1-inns2 = [[Shahid Nazir]] 1/26 (8 overs)\n| score-team2-inns2 =\n| runs-team2-inns2 =\n| wickets-team2-inns2 =\n| result = England awarded the match<br />(opposition refused to play)\n| venue = [[The Oval]], London\n| toss = Pakistan won the toss and elected to field.\n| umpires = [[Billy Doctrove]] (WI) and [[Darrell Hair]] (Aus)\n| motm = [[Younis Khan]] (Pak)<br />Players of the Series: [[Andrew Strauss]] (Eng) and [[Mohammad Yousuf (cricketer, born 1974)|Mohammad Yousuf]] (Pak)\n| report = [http://www.espncricinfo.com/engvpak/engine/match/225258.html Scorecard]\n| notes = Match abandoned on day 4 because Pakistan refused to resume play after tea.\n| rain = \n}}\nPakistan made three changes to their side for the final test. The uncertainty of the opening pair continued, with [[Salman Butt]] and [[Taufeeq Umar]] being dropped in favour of [[Imran Farhat]] and [[Mohammad Hafeez]]. The tourists' bowling ranks were boosted by the return of [[Mohammad Asif (cricketer)|Mohammad Asif]], for whom [[Mohammad Sami]] made way.\n\nPakistan won the toss and chose to field in cloudy conditions. This proved to be a good decision, as Pakistan's seamers [[Umar Gul]] and [[Mohammad Asif (cricketer)|Mohammad Asif]] took eight wickets between them on the way to bowling England out for 173. Asif in particular caused problems for England's batsmen, and left people wondering what the outcome of the series would have been had he not been injured for the earlier tests.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}\n\nLate on day 1, Pakistan began their reply confidently, and their fourth opening partnership combination of the series proved to be the most successful one. Hafeez hit some good shots before retiring hurt with a knee problem. He would return to complete his innings and score 95, while Farhat scored 91. England's poor first day was complete when they dropped [[Mohammad Yousuf (cricket)|Mohammad Yousuf]] twice before he reached double figures. He went on to score 128, his third century of the series.\n\nPakistan continued their dominance of the match on day 2, with the close of play score at 336/3, a lead of 163. On day 3, England finally managed to start taking wickets in between frequent rain and bad light interruptions, but they were not able to curtail Pakistan's scoring. [[Faisal Iqbal]] ended on 58 not out, his first contribution in the series. Pakistan were finally bowled out for 504, a lead of 331.\n\n[[Marcus Trescothick]] was dismissed early in England's second innings, in what would be his last test match appearance for England to date. [[Andrew Strauss]] and [[Alastair Cook]] then progressed the score to 78/1 at the close of play.\n\nThe (what would prove to be eventful) fourth day began with Strauss and Cook continuing on the improved batting performance before Strauss fell lbw to [[Danish Kaneria]] with the score on 115. [[Kevin Pietersen]] came in and played an aggressive innings, hitting 96 from 114 deliveries, and only falling when he chased a wide delivery in an attempt to bring up his century.\n\nThe dismissal of Cook for 83 off the bowling of [[Umar Gul]], with a delivery of reverse swing, resulted in umpires [[Darrell Hair]] and [[Billy Doctrove]] calling a halt to play so a set of used balls could be brought out to the middle. England were awarded 5 penalty runs and this event was the catalyst for the subsequent refusal to continue the match after tea by the Pakistan team. Based on the laws of cricket, the umpires declared Pakistan to have forfeited the game and [[Result_(cricket)#Awarded|awarded]] England the win.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/cricket/england/5268886.stm |title=Lengthy talks fail to save Test |publisher=BBC |date=20 August 2006 |accessdate=20 August 2006 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/cricket/5269906.stm |title=Inzamam charged in cheating row |publisher=BBC |date=21 August 2006 |accessdate=21 August 2006 }}</ref> The ICC later changed the result of the match to a draw,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci-icc/content/story/359329.html |title=ICC changes Oval forfeiture to draw |publisher=ESPN Sports Media |date=3 July 2008 |accessdate=21 September 2011 }}</ref> and then later reversed this decision on 1 February 2009.<ref name=\"award2009\">{{cite news|title=Cricket: England awarded Oval Test 'win' against Pakistan|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2009/feb/01/england-pakistan-oval|accessdate=8 January 2018|work=The Guardian|date=1 February 2009}}</ref>\n\n==T20 series==\n===Only T20I===\n{{Limited overs matches\n| date = 28 August 2006\n| time = 15:00\n| team1 = {{cr-rt|ENG}}\n| score1 = 144/7 (20 overs)\n| score2 = 148/5 (17.5 overs)\n| team2 = {{cr|PAK}}\n| runs1 = [[Marcus Trescothick]] 53 (36)\n| wickets1 = [[Abdul Razzaq (cricketer)|Abdul Razzaq]] 3/30 (4 overs)\n| runs2 = [[Mohammad Hafeez]] 46 (40)\n| wickets2 = [[Stuart Broad]] 2/35 (4 overs)\n| result = Pakistan won by 5 wickets\n| report = [http://www.espncricinfo.com/engvpak/engine/match/225263.html Scorecard]\n| venue = [[Nevil Road]], [[Bristol]]\n| umpires = [[Peter Hartley (cricketer)|Peter Hartley]] and [[Nigel Llong]]\n| toss = England won the toss and elected to bat.\n| rain = [[Ian Bell]], [[Stuart Broad]] and [[Michael Yardy]] (all Eng) made their T20I debuts.\n| notes = This was Pakistan's first T20I match.\n}}\n\nPakistan won the match by five wickets.

[[Kevin Pietersen]] was the next man out, adding just 28 runs for the third wicket, but [[Alastair Cook]] and [[Paul Collingwood]] both reached centuries on the way to a fourth-wicket partnership of 233 runs before Cook was out for 105. Collingwood top-scored in the innings with 186, and [[Ian Bell]] also managed an unbeaten 100 before England immediately declared on 528/9 with half a session left in the second day's play.\n\n[[Steve Harmison]] took two wickets in three balls before the close of play, helping England reduce Pakistan to 68/4 early on the third day; however, [[Mohammad Yousuf]] and captain [[Inzamam-ul-Haq]] added 173 runs for the fifth wicket, and [[Kamran Akmal]] also made a half-century, reaching 58 before he was caught behind off the bowling of [[Kevin Pietersen]]. Despite partners falling around him, [[Mohammad Yousuf (cricketer)|Mohammad Yousuf]] managed to bat on to a double-century before he was caught behind off Harmison to close the innings \u2013 Harmison finished with figures of 4/94.\n\nEngland began the process of building on their 83-run lead early on the fourth day, but Strauss' 128 was the only notable score as they amassed 296 runs before declaring early on the final day, giving Pakistan a target of 380 to chase in 73 overs. [[Salman Butt]] fell to the first ball of the innings from Hoggard, followed by [[Imran Farhat]] to leave the tourists at 33/2; however, scores of 48 from [[Faisal Iqbal]] and Mohammad Yousuf got them to 141/4, before Inzamam-ul-Haq and [[Abdul Razzaq (Pakistani cricket player)|Abdul Razzaq]] batted out the last session for 73 to secure a draw.\n\n===2nd Test===\n{{Test match\n| date = 27\u201329 July 2006\n| team1 = {{cr-rt|PAK}}\n| team2 = {{cr|ENG}}\n| score-team1-inns1 = 119 (38.4 overs)\n| runs-team1-inns1 = [[Younis Khan]] 44 (62)\n| wickets-team1-inns1 = [[Steve Harmison]] 6/19 (13 overs)\n| score-team2-inns1 = 461/9[[Declaration and forfeiture|d]] (133 overs)\n| runs-team2-inns1 = [[Alastair Cook]] 127 (260)\n| wickets-team2-inns1 = [[Umar Gul]] 3/96 (28 overs)\n| score-team1-inns2 = 222 (67.1 overs)\n| runs-team1-inns2 = [[Younis Khan]] 62 (119)\n| wickets-team1-inns2 = [[Steve Harmison]] 5/57 (18.1 overs)\n| score-team2-inns2 = \n| runs-team2-inns2 = \n| wickets-team2-inns2 = \n| result = England won by an innings and 120 runs\n| report = [http://www.espncricinfo.com/engvpak/engine/match/225256.html Scorecard]\n| venue = [[Old Trafford Cricket Ground|Old Trafford]], Manchester\n| umpires = [[Simon Taufel]] (Aus) and [[Steve Bucknor]] (WI)\n| motm = [[Steve Harmison]] (Eng)\n| toss = Pakistan won the toss and elected to bat.\n}}\nWith [[Inzamam-ul-Haq]]'s run of half-centuries against England finally stopped, as he was caught by [[Kevin Pietersen]] off [[Steve Harmison]]'s bowling for a duck, England recorded an innings victory over Pakistan to take a 1\u20130 lead into the third Test. In the first innings, Pakistan lost the last eight wickets for 29 to post 119 with no batsmen making a half-century; England surpassed that score for the loss of two wickets, and with [[Alastair Cook]] and [[Ian Bell]] both making hundreds (127 and 106* respectively), England could eventually declare near the end of day two having made 461. It took England 63 overs to clean up, with Harmison and [[Monty Panesar]] sharing the ten wickets evenly (the only wicket takers in both innings) with the help of wicket keeper [[Geraint Jones]], who caught five despite his fractured finger. Panesar took his second five-wicket-haul in three months, and was praised by opposition coach [[Bob Woolmer]].<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/cricket/england/5229112.stm Panesar tipped for greatness], from BBC, retrieved 31 July 2006</ref>\n\n===3rd Test===\n{{Test match\n| date = 4\u20138 August 2006\n| team1 = {{cr-rt|ENG}}\n| team2 = {{cr|PAK}}\n| score-team1-inns1 = 515 (123 overs)\n| runs-team1-inns1 = [[Kevin Pietersen]] 135 (169)\n| wickets-team1-inns1 = [[Umar Gul]] 5/123 (29 overs)\n| score-team2-inns1 = 538 (141.4 overs)\n| runs-team2-inns1 = [[Mohammad Yousuf (cricketer, born 1974)|Mohammad Yousuf]] 192 (261)\n| wickets-team2-inns1 = [[Monty Panesar]] 3/127 (47.4 overs)\n| score-team1-inns2 = 345 (88.3 overs)\n| runs-team1-inns2 = [[Andrew Strauss]] 116 (171)\n| wickets-team1-inns2 = [[Shahid Nazir]] 3/32 (14 overs)\n| score-team2-inns2 = 155 (47.5 overs)\n| runs-team2-inns2 = [[Younis Khan]] 41 (83)\n| wickets-team2-inns2 = [[Sajid Mahmood]] 4/22 (8 overs)\n| result = England won by 167 runs\n| report = [http://www.espncricinfo.com/engvpak/engine/match/225257.html Scorecard]\n| venue = [[Headingley Stadium|Headingley]], Leeds\n| umpires = [[Billy Doctrove]] (WI) and [[Darrell Hair]] (Aus)\n| motm = [[Younis Khan]] (Pak)\n| toss = England won the toss and elected to bat.\n}}\nAfter their innings defeat in the second test, Pakistan dropped [[Shahid Afridi]] and [[Abdul Razzaq (Pakistani cricket player)|Abdul Razzaq]], and had to swap [[Imran Farhat]] out due to injury. They brought in [[Salman Butt]] and [[Taufeeq Umar]] to open the innings, plus the bowling of [[Shahid Nazir]]. England only made one change, which was to swap the struggling wicketkeeper [[Geraint Jones]] for [[Chris Read]]. The wicketkeeper position had been the subject of much debate. Read was perceived as the better keeper, although Jones\u2019 batting skills were considered to be superior. However, Jones had not scored a significant innings for some time and Read was given an opportunity to impress for the first time since the West Indies tour of 2004.\n\nThe first day of the test prompted some interesting incidents as England won the toss and batted first. In the morning, there were three rogue decisions from the umpires (who had been testing the use of earpieces to communicate with off-field officials); in the afternoon Kevin Pietersen left the field in bizarre circumstances, and Pakistan responded with 11 overs of very mediocre bowling, using their opening batsmen to bowl during the period before the second new ball was due.\n\nIn amongst all this, Pietersen scored his 5th test century, and helped propel England to 347/6 by the end of the day. England continued on day 2, with [[Ian Bell]] posting his third consecutive test century, and the lower order added useful runs before England were bowled out for 515.\n\nPakistan's openers once again struggled, and they fell quickly to leave the tourists on 36/2. However, the experienced combination of [[Younis Khan]] and [[Mohammad Yousuf (cricket)|Mohammad Yousuf]] then combined to produce the largest partnership for Pakistan against England of 363 for the third wicket. They batted well into the afternoon session of the third day, before Yousuf gloved [[Stephen Harmison]] through to the keeper having scored 192.\n\nPakistan then lost some of their advantage in a bizarre passage of play leading up to the tea interval. Younis was run out on 173, [[Faisal Iqbal]] fell lbw to his first delivery faced (giving [[Paul Collingwood]] his first test wicket), and [[Inzamam-ul-Haq]] lost his wicket in a comical way, overbalancing while attempting to sweep a [[Monty Panesar]] delivery and falling onto his stumps.\n\nThe lower order batsmen tried to accelerate the scoring, but lost regular wickets in the process, and Pakistan were finally bowled out for 538.\n\nEngland's second innings started well, with the openers putting on 158 for the first wicket. [[Andrew Strauss]] went on to score 116, and [[Chris Read]] scored 55 down the order, but the other wickets fell quite regularly as England attempted to set up a position where they could push for a win on the final day. Pakistan's bowling attack shared the wickets between them, and eventually bowled England out for 345. Pakistan needed 323 runs on the final day to win.\n\nEngland's bowlers performed well on the final day, and took 5 wickets in the first session ensuring the 323 run target was well out of Pakistan's reach. The run out of [[Mohammad Yousuf (cricket)|Mohammad Yousuf]] for a single figure score was a key moment in the innings \u2013 in fact, Pakistan lost 3 of their top order batsmen to run outs during the game. [[Sajid Mahmood]] struck twice in an over shortly before lunch to remove [[Faisal Iqbal]] and [[Kamran Akmal]], and would go on to record test best figures of 4/22.\n\n[[Monty Panesar]] also demonstrated his promising talent, taking 3 wickets in the second innings to follow up on 3 wickets in the first, on a pitch not typically associated with assisting spinners. His dismissal of [[Younis Khan]] during the afternoon session was spectacular, with a wonderfully flighted delivery that just clipped the bail of the off stump.\n\nFrom this point, it was a matter of time before England took the honours.\n\nAs a result of a rib injury obtained during the course of the Test (and determined to be an ''internal'' injury rather than an ''external'' one<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/cricket/england/5253966.stm | work=BBC News | title=Rib injury keeps Inzamam waiting | date=7 August 2006}}</ref>) the Pakistan Captain, [[Inzamam-ul-Haq]], was unable to bat for 4h20m in the Pakistan 2nd innings, or until the fall of the 5th wicket (whichever came first). As England took five wickets in the first session of the last day, he was able to come in at number 7 in the order. His wicket was eventually the last to fall, being stumped off the bowling of [[Monty Panesar]], and Pakistan were all out for 155.\n\nEngland won the match by 167 runs, and took an unassailable 2\u20130 lead in the series, with one left to play.\n\n===4th Test===\n{{main|2006 ball-tampering controversy}}\n{{Test match\n| date = 17\u201320 August 2006\n| team1 = {{cr-rt|ENG}}\n| team2 = {{cr|PAK}}\n| score-team1-inns1 = 173 (53.2 overs)\n| runs-team1-inns1 = [[Alastair Cook]] 40 (69)\n| wickets-team1-inns1 = [[Umar Gul]] 4/46 (15.2 overs)\n| score-team2-inns1 = 504 (129.5 overs)\n| runs-team2-inns1 = [[Mohammad Yousuf (cricketer, born 1974)|Mohammad Yousuf]] 128 (236)\n| wickets-team2-inns1 = [[Monty Panesar|MS Panesar]] 4/125 (30.5 overs)\n| score-team1-inns2 = 298/4 (72 overs)\n| runs-team1-inns2 = [[Kevin Pietersen]] 96 (114)\n| wickets-team1-inns2 = [[Shahid Nazir]] 1/26 (8 overs)\n| score-team2-inns2 =\n| runs-team2-inns2 =\n| wickets-team2-inns2 =\n| result = England awarded the match<br />(opposition refused to play)\n| venue = [[The Oval]], London\n| toss = Pakistan won the toss and elected to field.\n| umpires = [[Billy Doctrove]] (WI) and [[Darrell Hair]] (Aus)\n| motm = [[Younis Khan]] (Pak)<br />Players of the Series: [[Andrew Strauss]] (Eng) and [[Mohammad Yousuf (cricketer, born 1974)|Mohammad Yousuf]] (Pak)\n| report = [http://www.espncricinfo.com/engvpak/engine/match/225258.html Scorecard]\n| notes = Match abandoned on day 4 because Pakistan refused to resume play after tea.\n| rain = \n}}\nPakistan made three changes to their side for the final test. The uncertainty of the opening pair continued, with [[Salman Butt]] and [[Taufeeq Umar]] being dropped in favour of [[Imran Farhat]] and [[Mohammad Hafeez]]. The tourists' bowling ranks were boosted by the return of [[Mohammad Asif (cricketer)|Mohammad Asif]], for whom [[Mohammad Sami]] made way.\n\nPakistan won the toss and chose to field in cloudy conditions. This proved to be a good decision, as Pakistan's seamers [[Umar Gul]] and [[Mohammad Asif (cricketer)|Mohammad Asif]] took eight wickets between them on the way to bowling England out for 173. Asif in particular caused problems for England's batsmen, and left people wondering what the outcome of the series would have been had he not been injured for the earlier tests.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}\n\nLate on day 1, Pakistan began their reply confidently, and their fourth opening partnership combination of the series proved to be the most successful one. Hafeez hit some good shots before retiring hurt with a knee problem. He would return to complete his innings and score 95, while Farhat scored 91. England's poor first day was complete when they dropped [[Mohammad Yousuf (cricket)|Mohammad Yousuf]] twice before he reached double figures. He went on to score 128, his third century of the series.\n\nPakistan continued their dominance of the match on day 2, with the close of play score at 336/3, a lead of 163. On day 3, England finally managed to start taking wickets in between frequent rain and bad light interruptions, but they were not able to curtail Pakistan's scoring. [[Faisal Iqbal]] ended on 58 not out, his first contribution in the series. Pakistan were finally bowled out for 504, a lead of 331.\n\n[[Marcus Trescothick]] was dismissed early in England's second innings, in what would be his last test match appearance for England to date. [[Andrew Strauss]] and [[Alastair Cook]] then progressed the score to 78/1 at the close of play.\n\nThe (what would prove to be eventful) fourth day began with Strauss and Cook continuing on the improved batting performance before Strauss fell lbw to [[Danish Kaneria]] with the score on 115. [[Kevin Pietersen]] came in and played an aggressive innings, hitting 96 from 114 deliveries, and only falling when he chased a wide delivery in an attempt to bring up his century.\n\nThe dismissal of Cook for 83 off the bowling of [[Umar Gul]], with a delivery of reverse swing, resulted in umpires [[Darrell Hair]] and [[Billy Doctrove]] calling a halt to play so a set of used balls could be brought out to the middle. England were awarded 5 penalty runs and this event was the catalyst for the subsequent refusal to continue the match after tea by the Pakistan team. Based on the laws of cricket, the umpires declared Pakistan to have forfeited the game and [[Result_(cricket)#Awarded|awarded]] England the win.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/cricket/england/5268886.stm |title=Lengthy talks fail to save Test |publisher=BBC |date=20 August 2006 |accessdate=20 August 2006 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/cricket/5269906.stm |title=Inzamam charged in cheating row |publisher=BBC |date=21 August 2006 |accessdate=21 August 2006 }}</ref> The ICC later changed the result of the match to a draw,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci-icc/content/story/359329.html |title=ICC changes Oval forfeiture to draw |publisher=ESPN Sports Media |date=3 July 2008 |accessdate=21 September 2011 }}</ref> and then later reversed this decision on 1 February 2009.<ref name=\"award2009\">{{cite news|title=Cricket: England awarded Oval Test 'win' against Pakistan|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2009/feb/01/england-pakistan-oval|accessdate=8 January 2018|work=The Guardian|date=1 February 2009}}</ref>\n\n==T20 series==\n===Only T20I===\n{{Limited overs matches\n| date = 28 August 2006\n| time = 15:00\n| team1 = {{cr-rt|ENG}}\n| score1 = 144/7 (20 overs)\n| score2 = 148/5 (17.5 overs)\n| team2 = {{cr|PAK}}\n| runs1 = [[Marcus Trescothick]] 53 (36)\n| wickets1 = [[Abdul Razzaq (cricketer)|Abdul Razzaq]] 3/30 (4 overs)\n| runs2 = [[Mohammad Hafeez]] 46 (40)\n| wickets2 = [[Stuart Broad]] 2/35 (4 overs)\n| result = Pakistan won by 5 wickets\n| report = [http://www.espncricinfo.com/engvpak/engine/match/225263.html Scorecard]\n| venue = [[Nevil Road]], [[Bristol]]\n| umpires = [[Peter Hartley (cricketer)|Peter Hartley]] and [[Nigel Llong]]\n| toss = England won the toss and elected to bat.\n| rain = [[Ian Bell]], [[Stuart Broad]] and [[Michael Yardy]] (all Eng) made their T20I debuts.\n| notes = This was Pakistan's first T20I match.\n}}\n\nPakistan won the match by five wickets.

The CAA was formed in 1998 on the base of both the Frunze Military Academy and the Armored Forces Academy. Since 2006, on the basis of decree  No. 473 of the [[Government of Russia]], the Military Institute of the Engineering Troops was included as a structural unit in the reorganization of the V. V.

Organizationally, academy consists of a command with a management apparatus, a military institute for the engineering troops, 1 branch, faculties, departments, research groups and laboratories, academic courses, doctoral studies, postgraduate studies, units and educational process support services. In all full-time faculties, officers have been trained for 2 years to fill positions in the brigade level.\n\n===Foreign cadets===\nOfficers and cadets of foreign armies are trained at special faculties. The term of their training is the same as that of Russian students and cadets, but preliminary. During the year, some of them study the [[Russian language]] in a preparatory course. The training of foreign military personnel is carried out in Russian practically according to the same plans and programs as Russian military personnel with restrictions in accordance with the specific bilateral and multilateral agreements that are concluded.\n\n===Band===\nBand of the Combined Arms Academy was formed in 1998 from Frunze Military Academy Band and the Malinovsky Military Armored Forces Academy Band. This gives the band an over 85-year history. By order of the Chairman of the Revolutionary Military Council on 19 December 1931, a military band at the Frunze Military Academy was created. The first artistic director of the band was Colonel V. Gurfinkel. During the [[Great Patriotic War]], many musicians of the band as part of the front-line brigades went to the front with concerts for fighters and commanders of the [[Red Army]].

The CAA was formed in 1998 on the base of both the Frunze Military Academy and the Armored Forces Academy. Since 2006, on the basis of decree  No. 473 of the [[Government of Russia]], the Military Institute of the Engineering Troops was included as a structural unit in the reorganization of the V. V. Kuybyshev Military Engineering Academy. In December 2008, its name was expanded to reflect its status as an institution.

Organizationally, academy consists of a command with a management apparatus, a military institute for the engineering troops, 1 branch, faculties, departments, research groups and laboratories, academic courses, doctoral studies, postgraduate studies, units and educational process support services. In all full-time faculties, officers have been trained for 2 years to fill positions in the brigade level.\n\n===Foreign cadets===\nOfficers and cadets of foreign armies are trained at special faculties. The term of their training is the same as that of Russian students and cadets, but preliminary. During the year, some of them study the [[Russian language]] in a preparatory course. The training of foreign military personnel is carried out in Russian practically according to the same plans and programs as Russian military personnel with restrictions in accordance with the specific bilateral and multilateral agreements that are concluded.\n\n===Band===\nBand of the Combined Arms Academy was formed in 1998 from Frunze Military Academy Band and the Malinovsky Military Armored Forces Academy Band. This gives the band an over 85-year history. By order of the Chairman of the Revolutionary Military Council on 19 December 1931, a military band at the Frunze Military Academy was created. The first artistic director of the band was Colonel V. Gurfinkel. During the [[Great Patriotic War]], many musicians of the band as part of the front-line brigades went to the front with concerts for fighters and commanders of the [[Red Army]]. It has performed at the largest concert venues in the capital: including the [[Kremlin Palace of Congresses]], the [[House of the Unions]], and the Tchaikovsky Concert Hall. On the All-Union Radio, the academy band recorded seven discs and over one hundred and twenty works of Soviet and foreign composers.

Due to privilege regarding race and color, mulattoes on the plantation were given more respectable jobs where as the Edmonson's  mainly worked in the corn fields and handled livestock. The Edmondson family worked on the plantation and earned a mere 12 dollars a month. During these times in the corn fields he would see \"angels in the clouds\" and believe it was God talking to him. <ref name=\":1\" />  Edmondson had little or no formal education. \n\n\nWhen his father died in late 1889,16 year-old Edmondson refused to continue to tirelessly work on the plantation and left to Nashville for work.<ref name=\":1\" /> He got a good job working at the expansive new [[Nashville, Chattanooga and St. Louis Railroad]] shops. After an injury sustained at the Railway shops in 1907, Edmondson took a job as a custodian at the Nashville Women's Hospital, where he worked until the hospital closed in 1931<ref name=\":2\" />. During this time Edmondson family officially resided in Nashville as his mother, Jane, was the last to leave the Compton Plantation. By age 39, his wages at Women's Hospital allowed him to buy a modest home and spacious lot in Edgehill, a segregated neighborhood in Nashville's Vanderbilt-Belmont area<ref name=\":1\" />.  Edmondson never married and he shared the home with his mother and sister, as well as, occasionally, other siblings, nieces, and nephews. With Jane's passing in 1922, Edmonson's sister, Sarah, soon became the woman of the house. It was said she would often hold family barbecues that consisted of laughter and storytelling.<ref name=\":1\" />  When the hospital closed in 1931, Edmondson picked up work at various part-time jobs and in his leisure, he could be found in his backyard sculpting and selling his vegetables.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" />\n\n\nIn 1948 Edmondson stopped sculpting. On February 7th, 1951 at age seventy-six, he passed quietly in his home in Nashville, Tennessee, where illness had confined him to bed for several months. As he was the last of his siblings to pass, his five nieces and seven nephews carried out his funeral service which was held the next day<ref name=\":1\" />. William Edmondson was buried in Mount Ararat Cemetery, now [[Greenwood Cemetery (Nashville, Tennessee)]], Nashville's oldest black cemetery. Today there is no sign of Edmondson's grave marker because at the time cheap wooden caskets were used to bury African Americans. As the wood decayed it would cause the grave markers to sink into the earth.<ref name=\":1\" /> Mt. Ararat burial records of the period were lost in a fire, so his exact grave site is unknown.\n== Art Career ==\n[[File:Crucifix_ca._1932-1937.jpg|alt=|thumb|369x369px|\"Crucifixion\" ca. 1932-1937, carved limestone, gift from Elizabeth Gibbons-Hanson]]\nEdmondson entered the world of sculpture at the advanced age of about 60 years old in 1934. He reported that he received a vision from God, who told him to start sculpting: \"I was out in the driveway with some old sculptures of stone when I heard a voice telling me to pick up my tools and start to work on a tombstone. I looked up in the sky and right there in the noon daylight, he hung a tombstone out for me to make. I knowed it was God telling me what to do.\"<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|last=Jack|first=Lindsey|title=Miracles : the sculptures of William Edmondson.|last2=Pa.)|first2=Janet Fleisher Gallery (Philadelphia|isbn=0962150630|oclc=32664611}}</ref> He carved tombstones primarily from chunks of discarded limestone from demolished buildings, which were delivered to him by wrecking companies' trucks. A signature Edmondson tombstone reflects strong large lettering carved in the stone<ref name=\":1\" />. He began his career by working on these tombstones, which he sold or gave to friends and family in the community. Soon he began carving lawn ornaments, birdbaths, and decorative sculptures. In his yard hung a sign \"Tomb-Stones. For Sale. Garden. Ornaments. Stone Work W M Edmondson\". <ref name=\":4\">{{Cite book|last=Spires|first=Elizabeth|title=I Hear God Talking to Me|publisher=Farrar, Straus and Giroux|year=2009|isbn=9780374335281|location=New York|pages=50-52}}</ref> \n\nEdmondson's work was influenced by his [[Christianity|Christian]] faith and his membership in a nearby [[Primitive Baptist]] congregation. His sculptures are straightforward and emphatic forms ranging from one to three feet in height, many sharing his unique religious symbolism. He carved figures of biblical characters, angels, doves, turtles, eagles, rabbits, horses and other real and fanciful creatures. His sculpture ''Noah's Ark'' stood tall in the middle of his backyard. It consists for four differently carved tiers of limestone and is the only architectural work that existed in his collection.<ref name=\":1\" />, He carved local community icons such as preachers, lawyers and school teachers, celebrities of the day who were important to the [[African American]] community, such as prizefighter [[Jack Johnson (boxer)|Jack Johnson]].<ref name=\":6\">{{cite web|url=http://www.riccomaresca.com/portfolio/william-edmondson/|title=WILLIAM EDMONDSON|work=Ricco Maresca Gallery|accessdate=May 23, 2015}}</ref> He also sculpted a number of popular figures such as First Lady [[Eleanor Roosevelt]].<ref name=\":6\" /> Edmondson also created and a small number of nude figures.<ref>''[http://www.rawvision.com/books/outsider-art-sourcebook Outsider Art Sourcebook]'', ed. John Maizels, Raw Vision, Watford, 2009, p.70</ref> Most of Edmonson's carved figures consisted of faces carved on a spherical base, with a small mouth resting directly under a vertical nose, following to connect to the curve of the brow. Sometimes he would decide not to carve the eyebrows and would opt to make the nose broader. It is believed he did this to achieve racial inclusion within his collection of artwork<ref name=\":1\" />. Even with versatility of his artwork, the common characteristic of an Edmondson sculpture was the overbuilt-ness of the figures carved within or from the limestone. Intentional texturing ranging between smooth, chiseled, polished or rough was present throughout the make of each sculpture.<ref name=\":1\" />  The facial technique, overbuiltness, and range in texturing can be observed in Edmonson's most well known masterpiece ''Bess and Joe'' and further with ''Mary and Martha'' <ref name=\":1\" />.    \n\nEdmondson had a large audience in Edgehill and as many of his figures were on display not only in his yard, but in that of neighbors homes and gardens.  Around 1935, about a few years into this sculpting career, [[Peabody College]] art enthusiast, Sidney Hirsch, wandered though Edgehill and caught eye of Edmondson's vast sculpture collection.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite book|last=Amico|first=Michael|url=https://www.press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/distributed/E/bo27331575.html|title=Experience|last2=Mackintosh|first2=Lucy|last3=Jane Marshall|first3=Jennifer|last4=Peters Corbett|first4=David|last5=Situ|first5=Xiao|last6=Slifkin|first6=Robert|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=2017|isbn=9780932171634|editor-last=Nemerov|editor-first=Alexander|location=Chicago|pages=102-133}}</ref> This is widely documented as Edmondson's \"discovery\" by [[Sidney Mttron Hirsch]]. Hirsch himself was a collector of African, Middle Eastern, and East Asian art and began to become one of Edmondson's greatest supporters .<ref name=\":3\" />  With this exposure, friends of Hirsch's and other fellow members of Nashville's elite bought Edmondson's sculptures for their homes, gardens, and offices, many of which were later displayed in exhibits at the [[Smithsonian American Art Museum]] and the [[Cheekwood Botanical Garden and Museum of Art]].<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite journal|last=Marshall|first=Jennifer Jane|date=2017|title=Nashville, New York, Paris, and Nashville: William Edmondson, Mobilized and Unmoved|url=|journal=American Art|volume=31|pages=69-76|via=Art & Architecture Source}}</ref> Of Hirsch's friends, Alfred and Elizabeth Starr, Alfred, a managing partner of a chain of movie theaters catering to the black community, and his wife Elizabeth, a painter, also became enthusiastic patrons and supporters of Edmondson's work.  They introduced Edmondson to several artist friends, including Starr's boyhood friend Meyer (Mike) Wolfe and his wife [[Louise Dahl-Wolfe]]. Dahl-Wolfe was a photographer who had recently begun work for ''[[Harper's Bazaar]]'' fashion magazine in [[New York City|New York]]. She made over a hundred of photographs of Edmondson's at work in his backyard shop, which she presented to the editor of Harper's Bazaar''.''

His work never commanded large sums during his lifetime. In 1939 and again in 1941, he worked under the [[Works Progress Administration]], a government sponsored relief program that included artists. In the late 1940s, his health began to fail and his artistic production slowed. Edmondson professed to be uninterested in fame, and he appears to have struggled financially for the final years of his life. He is believed to have created about 300 works during his working lifetime.  \n\n== Exhibitions ==\n[[File:Bird_ca._1937.jpg|alt=|thumb|291x291px|Bird ca. 1937, carved limestone, gift from Margaret Z. Robson]]\nEdmondson was given a one-man show, the first by an African American artist, at the [[Museum of Modern Art]] from October 20th to December 1st 1937<ref name=\":1\" />. In 1938, through MoMA's influence, William Edmondson's sculpture was included in the \"Three Centuries of Art in the United States\" in [[Paris, France|Paris]]. Interest in his work on the national and international stage was short-lived, and he was viewed primarily as a novelty, or exemplar of the \"primitive\" race-memory of an untutored, naive old Negro stone carver. Locally, Alfred Starr continued to promote Edmondson's work to his artistic friends and acquaintances, who bought work directly from Edmondson's \"sculpture yard\" or through the local Lyzon Gallery. Starr introduced the famed modernist photographer [[Edward Weston]] to Edmondson in 1941, and Weston made several striking photographs of Edmondson at work in his shop and yard. Also in 1941, he received the only other solo show accorded during his lifetime, at the Nashville Art Gallery. \n\nAfter very sporadic exhibition through the 1950s and 1960s (mostly as part of \"folk art\" exhibits), collector [[Edmund Fuller]] wrote a biography of Edmondson which was published in 1973. His sculpture was included in the influential \"[[Two Centuries of Black American Art]]\" exhibition curated by [[Fisk University]] Art Department chairman [[David C. Driskell]] in 1976.  In 1981 the new [[Tennessee State Museum]] opened with a permanent solo exhibition with six of Edmondson's sculptures featuring loaned sculptures from Elizabeth Starr's personal collection<ref name=\":1\" />, and the essays in the accompanying catalog sought to elevate appreciation of Edmondson's work as fine art. Through the 1980s and 1990s Edmondson's sculptures were exhibited extensively, though often in the limiting context of the labels \"outsider\", \"folk art\", \"self-taught\", and \"naive\". In 1999, Nashville's [[Cheekwood Botanical Garden and Museum of Art|Cheekwood Museum of Art]] mounted a major traveling retrospective exhibition and catalog that included in-depth biographical and critical essays on his life and work This exhibit also sculptures from Elizabeth Starrs personal collection of which she donated to the museum.<ref name=\":1\" /> A 2006 exhibition, \"William Edmondson, Bill Traylor, and the Modernist Impulse,\" paired Edmondson with another well-known self-taught artist and argued for Edmondson's acceptance as an artist without limiting labels. This exhibit displeayed twenty-one of Edmondon's sculptures which is the largest collection of Edmondson's art in the country<ref name=\":4\" />. In 2016 the [[Smithsonian American Art Museum]] received one of its largest gifts of folk art work from Margaret Z. Robson, among them were three of Edmondson's sculptures<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.si.edu/newsdesk/releases/smithsonian-american-art-museum-acquires-major-collection-self-taught-american-art|title=Smithsonian American Art Museum Acquires Major Collection of Self-Taught American Art|last=Baptiste|first=Laura|date=December 13, 2016|website=Smithsonian|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>. \n\nEdmondson's art is displayed permanently at the [[The Newark Museum of Art]],  [[American Folk Art Museum]], the [[Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden]], the [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]], the [[Abby Aldrich Rockefeller Folk Art Museum]], the [[Smithsonian American Art Museum]] and the Montclair Musuem in New Jersey<ref name=\":4\" />.\n\n== Legacy ==\nOn August 20, 2014, Mayor [[Karl Dean]] opened Nashville's first arts park, named in Edmondson's honor.

Due to privilege regarding race and color, mulattoes on the plantation were given more respectable jobs where as the Edmonson's  mainly worked in the corn fields and handled livestock. The Edmondson family worked on the plantation and earned a mere 12 dollars a month. During these times in the corn fields he would see \"angels in the clouds\" and believe it was God talking to him. <ref name=\":1\" />  Edmondson had little or no formal education. \n\n\nWhen his father died in late 1889,16 year-old Edmondson refused to continue to tirelessly work on the plantation and left to Nashville for work.<ref name=\":1\" /> He got a good job working at the expansive new [[Nashville, Chattanooga and St. Louis Railroad]] shops. After an injury sustained at the Railway shops in 1907, Edmondson took a job as a custodian at the Nashville Women's Hospital, where he worked until the hospital closed in 1931<ref name=\":2\" />. During this time Edmondson family officially resided in Nashville as his mother, Jane, was the last to leave the Compton Plantation. By age 39, his wages at Women's Hospital allowed him to buy a modest home and spacious lot in Edgehill, a segregated neighborhood in Nashville's Vanderbilt-Belmont area<ref name=\":1\" />.  Edmondson never married and he shared the home with his mother and sister, as well as, occasionally, other siblings, nieces, and nephews. With Jane's passing in 1922, Edmonson's sister, Sarah, soon became the woman of the house. It was said she would often hold family barbecues that consisted of laughter and storytelling.<ref name=\":1\" />  When the hospital closed in 1931, Edmondson picked up work at various part-time jobs and in his leisure, he could be found in his backyard sculpting and selling his vegetables.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" />\n\n\nIn 1948 Edmondson stopped sculpting. On February 7th, 1951 at age seventy-six, he passed quietly in his home in Nashville, Tennessee, where illness had confined him to bed for several months. As he was the last of his siblings to pass, his five nieces and seven nephews carried out his funeral service which was held the next day<ref name=\":1\" />. William Edmondson was buried in Mount Ararat Cemetery, now [[Greenwood Cemetery (Nashville, Tennessee)]], Nashville's oldest black cemetery. Today there is no sign of Edmondson's grave marker because at the time cheap wooden caskets were used to bury African Americans. As the wood decayed it would cause the grave markers to sink into the earth.<ref name=\":1\" /> Mt. Ararat burial records of the period were lost in a fire, so his exact grave site is unknown.\n== Art Career ==\n[[File:Crucifix_ca._1932-1937.jpg|alt=|thumb|369x369px|\"Crucifixion\" ca. 1932-1937, carved limestone, gift from Elizabeth Gibbons-Hanson]]\nEdmondson entered the world of sculpture at the advanced age of about 60 years old in 1934. He reported that he received a vision from God, who told him to start sculpting: \"I was out in the driveway with some old sculptures of stone when I heard a voice telling me to pick up my tools and start to work on a tombstone. I looked up in the sky and right there in the noon daylight, he hung a tombstone out for me to make. I knowed it was God telling me what to do.\"<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|last=Jack|first=Lindsey|title=Miracles : the sculptures of William Edmondson.|last2=Pa.)|first2=Janet Fleisher Gallery (Philadelphia|isbn=0962150630|oclc=32664611}}</ref> He carved tombstones primarily from chunks of discarded limestone from demolished buildings, which were delivered to him by wrecking companies' trucks. A signature Edmondson tombstone reflects strong large lettering carved in the stone<ref name=\":1\" />. He began his career by working on these tombstones, which he sold or gave to friends and family in the community. Soon he began carving lawn ornaments, birdbaths, and decorative sculptures. In his yard hung a sign \"Tomb-Stones. For Sale. Garden. Ornaments. Stone Work W M Edmondson\". <ref name=\":4\">{{Cite book|last=Spires|first=Elizabeth|title=I Hear God Talking to Me|publisher=Farrar, Straus and Giroux|year=2009|isbn=9780374335281|location=New York|pages=50-52}}</ref> \n\nEdmondson's work was influenced by his [[Christianity|Christian]] faith and his membership in a nearby [[Primitive Baptist]] congregation. His sculptures are straightforward and emphatic forms ranging from one to three feet in height, many sharing his unique religious symbolism. He carved figures of biblical characters, angels, doves, turtles, eagles, rabbits, horses and other real and fanciful creatures. His sculpture ''Noah's Ark'' stood tall in the middle of his backyard. It consists for four differently carved tiers of limestone and is the only architectural work that existed in his collection.<ref name=\":1\" />, He carved local community icons such as preachers, lawyers and school teachers, celebrities of the day who were important to the [[African American]] community, such as prizefighter [[Jack Johnson (boxer)|Jack Johnson]].<ref name=\":6\">{{cite web|url=http://www.riccomaresca.com/portfolio/william-edmondson/|title=WILLIAM EDMONDSON|work=Ricco Maresca Gallery|accessdate=May 23, 2015}}</ref> He also sculpted a number of popular figures such as First Lady [[Eleanor Roosevelt]].<ref name=\":6\" /> Edmondson also created and a small number of nude figures.<ref>''[http://www.rawvision.com/books/outsider-art-sourcebook Outsider Art Sourcebook]'', ed. John Maizels, Raw Vision, Watford, 2009, p.70</ref> Most of Edmonson's carved figures consisted of faces carved on a spherical base, with a small mouth resting directly under a vertical nose, following to connect to the curve of the brow. Sometimes he would decide not to carve the eyebrows and would opt to make the nose broader. It is believed he did this to achieve racial inclusion within his collection of artwork<ref name=\":1\" />. Even with versatility of his artwork, the common characteristic of an Edmondson sculpture was the overbuilt-ness of the figures carved within or from the limestone. Intentional texturing ranging between smooth, chiseled, polished or rough was present throughout the make of each sculpture.<ref name=\":1\" />  The facial technique, overbuiltness, and range in texturing can be observed in Edmonson's most well known masterpiece ''Bess and Joe'' and further with ''Mary and Martha'' <ref name=\":1\" />.    \n\nEdmondson had a large audience in Edgehill and as many of his figures were on display not only in his yard, but in that of neighbors homes and gardens.  Around 1935, about a few years into this sculpting career, [[Peabody College]] art enthusiast, Sidney Hirsch, wandered though Edgehill and caught eye of Edmondson's vast sculpture collection.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite book|last=Amico|first=Michael|url=https://www.press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/distributed/E/bo27331575.html|title=Experience|last2=Mackintosh|first2=Lucy|last3=Jane Marshall|first3=Jennifer|last4=Peters Corbett|first4=David|last5=Situ|first5=Xiao|last6=Slifkin|first6=Robert|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=2017|isbn=9780932171634|editor-last=Nemerov|editor-first=Alexander|location=Chicago|pages=102-133}}</ref> This is widely documented as Edmondson's \"discovery\" by [[Sidney Mttron Hirsch]]. Hirsch himself was a collector of African, Middle Eastern, and East Asian art and began to become one of Edmondson's greatest supporters .<ref name=\":3\" />  With this exposure, friends of Hirsch's and other fellow members of Nashville's elite bought Edmondson's sculptures for their homes, gardens, and offices, many of which were later displayed in exhibits at the [[Smithsonian American Art Museum]] and the [[Cheekwood Botanical Garden and Museum of Art]].<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite journal|last=Marshall|first=Jennifer Jane|date=2017|title=Nashville, New York, Paris, and Nashville: William Edmondson, Mobilized and Unmoved|url=|journal=American Art|volume=31|pages=69-76|via=Art & Architecture Source}}</ref> Of Hirsch's friends, Alfred and Elizabeth Starr, Alfred, a managing partner of a chain of movie theaters catering to the black community, and his wife Elizabeth, a painter, also became enthusiastic patrons and supporters of Edmondson's work.  They introduced Edmondson to several artist friends, including Starr's boyhood friend Meyer (Mike) Wolfe and his wife [[Louise Dahl-Wolfe]]. Dahl-Wolfe was a photographer who had recently begun work for ''[[Harper's Bazaar]]'' fashion magazine in [[New York City|New York]]. She made over a hundred of photographs of Edmondson's at work in his backyard shop, which she presented to the editor of Harper's Bazaar''.'' She attempted to publish his work but newspaper chain mogul [[William Randolph Hearst]], had a prejudice against showing Negro art as he seen them as nothing other than servants.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aaregistry.org/historic_events/view/william-edmondson-down-home-artist-forging-beauty-stone|title=William Edmondson, a down home artist forging beauty from stone|work=aaregistry.org|accessdate=May 23, 2015}}</ref> <ref name=\":4\" /> She then brought Edmondson's work to the attention of fellow Tennessean Thomas Mabry and his boss [[Alfred Barr]], the director of the [[Museum of Modern Art]] (MoMA)<ref name=\":1\" />.    \n\nEdmondson's career lasted for about fifteen years. His work never commanded large sums during his lifetime. In 1939 and again in 1941, he worked under the [[Works Progress Administration]], a government sponsored relief program that included artists. In the late 1940s, his health began to fail and his artistic production slowed.
