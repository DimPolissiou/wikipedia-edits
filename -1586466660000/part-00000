The ''Matrix'' franchise was further expanded through the production of comic books, video games and animated short films, with which the Wachowskis were heavily involved. The ''Matrix'' franchise has also inspired books and theories expanding on some of the religious and philosophical ideas alluded to in the films. A fourth installment is scheduled for May 21st 2021.\n\n==Plot==\nAt an abandoned hotel within a major city, a woman (later revealed to be [[Trinity (The Matrix)|Trinity]]) is cornered by a police squad but quickly overpowers them with superhuman abilities. She flees, pursued by the police and a group of mysterious suited [[Agent (The Matrix)|Agents]] capable of similar superhuman feats. She answers a ringing public telephone and vanishes an instant before the Agents crash a truck into the booth.\n\n[[Programmer|Computer programmer]] Thomas Anderson, known in the [[Security hacker|hacking]] scene by his [[Alter ego|alias]] \"[[Neo (The Matrix)|Neo]]\", feels something is wrong with the world and is puzzled by repeated online encounters with the phrase \"the Matrix.\" Trinity contacts him and tells him a man named [[Morpheus (The Matrix)|Morpheus]] has the answers he seeks. A team of Agents and police, led by [[Agent Smith]], arrives at Neo's workplace in search of him. Despite Morpheus' attempt to guide Neo to safety via telephone, he is captured and coerced into helping the Agents locate Morpheus, whom they regard as a \"known terrorist.\" Refusing to cooperate initially, Neo is subdued when his mouth is digitally erased and a tracking bug is inserted into his navel, which is intended to lead them to Morpheus. He later wakes up, and assumes it was a dream. He is then contacted by Trinity, who removes the bug from his navel and takes him to meet Morpheus. Undeterred, Neo later meets Morpheus, who offers him a choice between [[red pill and blue pill|two pills]]; red to show him the truth about the Matrix, and blue to return him to his former life. After Neo swallows the red pill, his reality starts falling apart, and soon he awakens in a liquid-filled pod among countless others attached to an elaborate electrical system. He is retrieved and brought aboard Morpheus' hovercraft, the ''[[Nebuchadnezzar (The Matrix)|Nebuchadnezzar]]''.\n\nAs Neo recuperates from a lifetime of physical inactivity in the pod, Morpheus explains the truth. In the early 21st century, there was a war between humans and [[artificial intelligence|intelligent machines]]. When humans blocked the machines' access to solar energy, the machines responded by harvesting the humans' [[bioelectromagnetics|bioelectric]] power, keeping them pacified in the Matrix, a shared [[simulated reality]] modeled after the world as it was at the end of the 20th century. While the machines have taken over the world, the city of [[Zion (The Matrix)|Zion]] still remains as the last refuge of free humans. Morpheus and his crew are a group of rebels who hack into the Matrix to \"unplug\" enslaved humans and recruit them; their understanding of the Matrix's simulated nature enables them to bend its physical laws, granting them superhuman abilities. Morpheus warns Neo that death within the Matrix also kills the physical body, and that the Agents he met are powerful sentient computer programs that eliminate threats to the system, while machines called Sentinels search to destroy rebels in the real world. Neo's prowess during virtual combat training lends credibility to Morpheus's belief that Neo is \"the One\", an especially powerful human prophesied to free humanity and end the war.\n\nThe group enters the Matrix to visit [[The Oracle (The Matrix)|the Oracle]], the prophet who predicted the emergence of the One. She implies to Neo, that he is not the One and warns that he will have to choose between Morpheus's life and his own. The group is ambushed by Agents and tactical police, tipped by [[Cypher (The Matrix)|Cypher]], a disgruntled crew member who seeks to betray Morpheus in exchange for a comfortable life in the Matrix. Morpheus allows himself to be captured so the rest of the crew can escape. Cypher exits the Matrix first and murders several crew members as they lie defenseless in the real world. Before he can kill Neo, [[Tank (The Matrix)|Tank]], a crewman whom he had only wounded, kills him.\n\nIn the Matrix, the Agents interrogate Morpheus to learn his access codes to the [[mainframe computer]] in Zion. Tank proposes killing Morpheus to prevent this, but Neo resolves to return to the Matrix to rescue Morpheus, as prophesied by the Oracle; Trinity insists she accompany him. While rescuing Morpheus, Neo gains confidence in his abilities, performing feats comparable to the Agents'. Morpheus and Trinity exit the Matrix, but Smith ambushes and kills Neo before he can leave. As a group of Sentinels attack the ''Nebuchadnezzar'', Trinity whispers to Neo that he cannot be dead, because she loves him and the Oracle told her that she would fall in love with the One. She kisses Neo and he revives with newfound power to perceive and control the Matrix. He effortlessly defeats Smith, and leaves the Matrix just in time for the ship's [[electromagnetic pulse]] to disable the Sentinels.\n\nLater, Neo makes a telephone call inside the Matrix, promising the machines that he will show their prisoners \"a world where anything is possible\". He hangs up and flies into the sky.\n\n==Cast==\n{{See also|List of Matrix series characters}}\n* [[Keanu Reeves]] as [[Neo (The Matrix)|Neo]]: <br />A computer programmer, born Thomas A.

The Meditation hypothesizes that the perceived world might be a comprehensive illusion created to deceive us.<ref name=\"Salon philosophy\">{{cite web |url=http://www.salon.com/2002/12/05/matrix_2/ |title=\"The Matrix and Philosophy\" by William Irwin, ed. |work=[[Salon (website)|Salon]] |date=December 5, 2002 |author=Miller, Laura |accessdate=November 15, 2012}}</ref> The same premise can be found in [[Hilary Putnam]]'s [[brain in a vat]] scenario proposed in the [[1980s]].<ref name=\"Salon philosophy\" /> A connection between the premise of ''The Matrix'' and [[Plato]]'s [[Allegory of the Cave]] has also been suggested. The allegory is related to Plato's [[theory of Forms]], which holds that the true essence of an object is not what we perceive with our senses, but rather its quality, and that most people perceive only the shadow of the object and are thus limited to false perception.<ref name=\"Influence Screened\" />\n\nThe philosophy of [[Immanuel Kant]] has also been claimed as another influence on the film, and in particular how individuals within the Matrix interact with one another and with the system. Kant states in his ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'' that people come to know and explore our world through synthetic means (language, etc.), and thus this makes it rather difficult to discern truth from falsely perceived views. This means people are their own agents of deceit, and so in order for them to know truth, they must choose to openly pursue truth. This idea can be examined in Agent Smith's monologue about the first version of the Matrix, which was designed as a human [[utopia]], a perfect world without suffering and with total happiness. Agent Smith explains that, \"it was a disaster. No one accepted the program. Entire crops [of people] were lost.\" The machines had to amend their choice of programming in order to make people subservient to them, and so they conceived the Matrix in the image of the world in 1999. The world in 1999 was far from a utopia, but still humans accepted this over the suffering-less utopia. According to William Irwin this is Kantian, because the machines wished to impose a perfect world on humans in an attempt to keep people content, so that they would remain completely submissive to the machines, both consciously and subconsciously, but humans were not easy to make content.<ref>Irwin, William. \"We Are (the) One!\" ''The Matrix and Philosophy: Welcome to the Desert of the Real''.

The ''Matrix'' franchise was further expanded through the production of comic books, video games and animated short films, with which the Wachowskis were heavily involved. The ''Matrix'' franchise has also inspired books and theories expanding on some of the religious and philosophical ideas alluded to in the films. A fourth installment is scheduled for May 21st 2021.\n\n==Plot==\nAt an abandoned hotel within a major city, a woman (later revealed to be [[Trinity (The Matrix)|Trinity]]) is cornered by a police squad but quickly overpowers them with superhuman abilities. She flees, pursued by the police and a group of mysterious suited [[Agent (The Matrix)|Agents]] capable of similar superhuman feats. She answers a ringing public telephone and vanishes an instant before the Agents crash a truck into the booth.\n\n[[Programmer|Computer programmer]] Thomas Anderson, known in the [[Security hacker|hacking]] scene by his [[Alter ego|alias]] \"[[Neo (The Matrix)|Neo]]\", feels something is wrong with the world and is puzzled by repeated online encounters with the phrase \"the Matrix.\" Trinity contacts him and tells him a man named [[Morpheus (The Matrix)|Morpheus]] has the answers he seeks. A team of Agents and police, led by [[Agent Smith]], arrives at Neo's workplace in search of him. Despite Morpheus' attempt to guide Neo to safety via telephone, he is captured and coerced into helping the Agents locate Morpheus, whom they regard as a \"known terrorist.\" Undeterred, Neo later meets Morpheus, who offers him a choice between [[red pill and blue pill|two pills]]; red to show him the truth about the Matrix, and blue to return him to his former life. After Neo swallows the red pill, his reality starts falling apart, and soon he awakens in a liquid-filled pod among countless others attached to an elaborate electrical system. He is retrieved and brought aboard Morpheus' hovercraft, the ''[[Nebuchadnezzar (The Matrix)|Nebuchadnezzar]]''.\n\nAs Neo recuperates from a lifetime of physical inactivity in the pod, Morpheus explains the truth. In the early 21st century, there was a war between humans and [[artificial intelligence|intelligent machines]]. When humans blocked the machines' access to solar energy, the machines responded by harvesting the humans' [[bioelectromagnetics|bioelectric]] power, keeping them pacified in the Matrix, a shared [[simulated reality]] modeled after the world as it was at the end of the 20th century. While the machines have taken over the world, the city of [[Zion (The Matrix)|Zion]] still remains as the last refuge of free humans. Morpheus and his crew are a group of rebels who hack into the Matrix to \"unplug\" enslaved humans and recruit them; their understanding of the Matrix's simulated nature enables them to bend its physical laws, granting them superhuman abilities. Morpheus warns Neo that death within the Matrix also kills the physical body, and that the Agents he met are powerful sentient computer programs that eliminate threats to the system, while machines called Sentinels search to destroy rebels in the real world. Neo's prowess during virtual combat training lends credibility to Morpheus's belief that Neo is \"the One\", an especially powerful human prophesied to free humanity and end the war.\n\nThe group enters the Matrix to visit [[The Oracle (The Matrix)|the Oracle]], the prophet who predicted the emergence of the One. She implies to Neo, that he is not the One and warns that he will have to choose between Morpheus's life and his own. The group is ambushed by Agents and tactical police, tipped by [[Cypher (The Matrix)|Cypher]], a disgruntled crew member who seeks to betray Morpheus in exchange for a comfortable life in the Matrix. Morpheus allows himself to be captured so the rest of the crew can escape. Cypher exits the Matrix first and murders several crew members as they lie defenseless in the real world. Before he can kill Neo, [[Tank (The Matrix)|Tank]], a crewman whom he had only wounded, kills him.\n\nIn the Matrix, the Agents interrogate Morpheus to learn his access codes to the [[mainframe computer]] in Zion. Tank proposes killing Morpheus to prevent this, but Neo resolves to return to the Matrix to rescue Morpheus, as prophesied by the Oracle; Trinity insists she accompany him. While rescuing Morpheus, Neo gains confidence in his abilities, performing feats comparable to the Agents'. Morpheus and Trinity exit the Matrix, but Smith ambushes and kills Neo before he can leave. As a group of Sentinels attack the ''Nebuchadnezzar'', Trinity whispers to Neo that he cannot be dead, because she loves him and the Oracle told her that she would fall in love with the One. She kisses Neo and he revives with newfound power to perceive and control the Matrix. He effortlessly defeats Smith, and leaves the Matrix just in time for the ship's [[electromagnetic pulse]] to disable the Sentinels.\n\nLater, Neo makes a telephone call inside the Matrix, promising the machines that he will show their prisoners \"a world where anything is possible\". He hangs up and flies into the sky.\n\n==Cast==\n{{See also|List of Matrix series characters}}\n* [[Keanu Reeves]] as [[Neo (The Matrix)|Neo]]: <br />A computer programmer, born Thomas A.

The Meditation hypothesizes that the perceived world might be a comprehensive illusion created to deceive us.<ref name=\"Salon philosophy\">{{cite web |url=http://www.salon.com/2002/12/05/matrix_2/ |title=\"The Matrix and Philosophy\" by William Irwin, ed. |work=[[Salon (website)|Salon]] |date=December 5, 2002 |author=Miller, Laura |accessdate=November 15, 2012}}</ref> The same premise can be found in [[Hilary Putnam]]'s [[brain in a vat]] scenario proposed in the [[1980s]].<ref name=\"Salon philosophy\" /> A connection between the premise of ''The Matrix'' and [[Plato]]'s [[Allegory of the Cave]] has also been suggested. The allegory is related to Plato's [[theory of Forms]], which holds that the true essence of an object is not what we perceive with our senses, but rather its quality, and that most people perceive only the shadow of the object and are thus limited to false perception.<ref name=\"Influence Screened\" />\n\nThe philosophy of [[Immanuel Kant]] has also been claimed as another influence on the film, and in particular how individuals within the Matrix interact with one another and with the system. Kant states in his ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'' that people come to know and explore our world through synthetic means (language, etc.), and thus this makes it rather difficult to discern truth from falsely perceived views. This means people are their own agents of deceit, and so in order for them to know truth, they must choose to openly pursue truth. This idea can be examined in Agent Smith's monologue about the first version of the Matrix, which was designed as a human [[utopia]], a perfect world without suffering and with total happiness. Agent Smith explains that, \"it was a disaster. No one accepted the program. Entire crops [of people] were lost.\" The machines had to amend their choice of programming in order to make people subservient to them, and so they conceived the Matrix in the image of the world in 1999. The world in 1999 was far from a utopia, but still humans accepted this over the suffering-less utopia. According to William Irwin this is Kantian, because the machines wished to impose a perfect world on humans in an attempt to keep people content, so that they would remain completely submissive to the machines, both consciously and subconsciously, but humans were not easy to make content.<ref>Irwin, William. \"We Are (the) One!\" ''The Matrix and Philosophy: Welcome to the Desert of the Real''.

Other unusual forms of carbon exist at very high temperatures or extreme pressures. Around 500 hypothetical 3-periodic allotropes of carbon are known at the present time, according to the Samara Carbon Allotrope Database (SACADA).<ref name=SACADA>{{cite journal\n|doi=10.1002/anie.201600655\n|pmid=27438532\n|pmc=5113780\n|title=Homo Citans and Carbon Allotropes: For an Ethics of Citation\n|year=2016\n|last1=Hoffmann\n|first1=R.\n|authorlink1= Roald Hoffmann\n|last2=Kabanov\n|first2=A.\n|last3=Golov\n|first3=A.\n|last4=Proserpio\n|first4=D.\n|journal=Angewandte Chemie\n|volume=55\n|issue=37\n|pages=10962\u201310976}}</ref>\n\n==Diamond==\n{{main|Diamond}}\n\n'''Diamond''' is a well known allotrope of carbon. The [[hardness]] and high [[Dispersion (optics)|dispersion of light]] of diamond make it useful for both industrial applications and jewelry. Diamond is the hardest known natural [[mineral]]. This makes it an excellent abrasive and makes it hold polish and luster extremely well. No known naturally occurring substance can cut (or even scratch) a diamond, except another diamond.\n\nThe market for industrial-grade diamonds operates much differently from its gem-grade counterpart. Industrial diamonds are valued mostly for their hardness and heat conductivity, making many of the [[gemology|gemological]] characteristics of diamond, including clarity and color, mostly irrelevant. This helps explain why 80% of mined diamonds (equal to about 100 million carats or 20 tonnes annually) are unsuitable for use as gemstones and known as ''[[bort]]'', are destined for industrial use. In addition to mined diamonds, [[synthetic diamond]]s found industrial applications almost immediately after their invention in the 1950s; another 400 million carats (80 tonnes) of synthetic diamonds are produced annually for industrial use, which is nearly four times the mass of natural diamonds mined over the same period.\n\nThe dominant industrial use of diamond is [[Diamond cutting|cutting]], [[Diamond drilling|drilling]] ([[drill bit]]s), [[Diamond grinding|grinding]] (diamond edged cutters), and polishing. Most uses of diamonds in these technologies do not require large diamonds; in fact, most diamonds that are not gem-quality can find an industrial use. Diamonds are embedded in drill tips or saw blades, or ground into a powder for use in grinding and polishing applications (due to its extraordinary hardness). Specialized applications include use in laboratories as containment for high pressure experiments (see [[diamond anvil]]), high-performance [[bearing (mechanical)|bearings]], and limited use in specialized [[window]]s of technical apparatuses.\n\nWith the continuing advances being made in the production of synthetic diamond, future applications are beginning to become feasible. Garnering much excitement is the possible use of diamond as a [[semiconductor]] suitable to build [[integrated circuit|microchip]]s from, or the use of diamond as a [[heat sink]] in [[electronics]]. Significant research efforts in [[Japan]], [[Europe]], and the [[United States]] are under way to capitalize on the potential offered by diamond's unique material properties, combined with increased quality and quantity of supply starting to become available from synthetic diamond manufacturers.\n\nEach carbon atom in a diamond is covalently bonded to four other carbons in a [[tetrahedron]]. These tetrahedrons together form a 3-dimensional network of six-membered carbon rings (similar to [[cyclohexane]]), in the [[chair conformation]], allowing for zero [[bond angle]] strain. This stable network of [[covalent bonds]] and hexagonal rings is the reason that diamond is so strong.  Although graphite is the most stable allotrope of carbon under standard laboratory conditions (273 or 298 K, 1 atm), a recent computational study indicated that under idealized conditions (''T'' = 0, ''p'' = 0), diamond is the most stable allotrope by 1.1 kJ/mol compared to graphite.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Grochala|first=Wojciech|date=2014-04-01|title=Diamond: Electronic Ground State of Carbon at Temperatures Approaching 0 K|journal=Angewandte Chemie International Edition|language=en|volume=53|issue=14|pages=3680\u20133683|doi=10.1002/anie.201400131|issn=1521-3773|pmid=24615828}}</ref>\n\n==Graphite==\n{{main|Graphite}}\n'''Graphite''', named by [[Abraham Gottlob Werner]] in 1789, from the Greek \u03b3\u03c1\u03ac\u03c6\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd ({{transl|grc|graphein}}, \"to draw/write\", for its use in pencils) is one of the most common allotropes of carbon. Unlike diamond, graphite is an electrical conductor. Thus, it can be used in, for instance, electrical arc lamp electrodes. Likewise, under [[standard conditions]], graphite is the most stable form of carbon. Therefore, it is used in thermochemistry as the [[standard state]] for defining the [[standard enthalpy of formation|heat of formation]] of carbon compounds.\n\nGraphite [[Electrical conductor|conducts electricity]], due to [[delocalization]] of the [[pi bond]] [[electron]]s above and below the planes of the carbon atoms. These electrons are free to move, so are able to conduct electricity. However, the electricity is only conducted along the plane of the layers. In diamond, all four outer electrons of each carbon atom are 'localized' between the atoms in covalent bonding. The movement of electrons is restricted and diamond does not conduct an electric current. In graphite, each carbon atom uses only 3 of its 4 outer energy level electrons in covalently bonding to three other carbon atoms in a plane. Each carbon atom contributes one electron to a delocalized system of electrons that is also a part of the chemical bonding. The delocalized electrons are free to move throughout the plane. For this reason, graphite conducts electricity along the planes of carbon atoms, but does not conduct in a direction at right angles to the plane.\n\nGraphite powder is used as a dry [[lubricant]]. Although it might be thought that this industrially important property is due entirely to the [[cleavage (crystal)|loose interlamellar coupling]] between sheets in the structure, in fact in a [[vacuum]] environment (such as in technologies for use in [[Outer space|space]]), graphite was found to be a very poor lubricant. This fact led to the discovery that graphite's lubricity is due to [[adsorbed]] air and water between the layers, unlike other layered dry lubricants such as [[molybdenum disulfide]]. Recent studies suggest that an effect called [[superlubricity]] can also account for this effect.\n\nWhen a large number of crystallographic defects (physical) bind these planes together, graphite loses its lubrication properties and becomes [[pyrolytic carbon]], a useful material in blood-contacting implants such as [[prosthetic]] [[heart valve]]s.\n\nGraphite is the most stable allotrope of carbon. Contrary to popular belief, high-purity graphite does not readily burn, even at elevated temperatures.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=22aTqTKRPBI Glowing nuclear reactor graphite 2].

During a fire the graphite intumesces (expands and chars) to resist fire penetration and prevent the spread of fumes. A typical start expansion temperature (SET) is between 150 and 300&nbsp;\u00b0C.\n\nDensity: graphite's specific gravity is 2.3, which makes it lighter than diamonds.\n\nChemical activity: it is slightly more reactive than diamond. This is because the reactants are able to penetrate between the hexagonal layers of carbon atoms in graphite. It is unaffected by ordinary solvents, dilute acids, or fused alkalis. However, [[chromic acid]] oxidizes it to carbon dioxide.\n\n===Graphene===\n{{main|Graphene}}\nA single layer of graphite is called [[graphene]] and has extraordinary electrical, thermal, and physical properties. It can be produced by [[epitaxy]] on an insulating or conducting substrate or by mechanical exfoliation (repeated peeling) from graphite.

It can be made via high pressures, but without that pressure, the material reverts to graphene. Another technique is to add hydrogen atoms but those bonds are weak. Using flourine (xenon-diflouride) instead brings the layers closer together, strengthening the bonds. This is called f-diamane.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://newatlas.com/materials/ultrathin-diamond-film-graphene/|title=Ultrathin diamond film made from graphene could toughen up electronics|last=Irving|first=Michael|date=2019-12-10|website=New Atlas|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-12-16}}</ref>\n\n==Amorphous carbon==\n{{main|Amorphous carbon}}\n'''Amorphous carbon''' is the name used for [[carbon]] that does not have any [[crystal]]line structure.

They are named for the resemblance to the geodesic structures devised by [[Buckminster Fuller|Richard Buckminster \"Bucky\" Fuller]]. Fullerenes are positively curved molecules of varying sizes composed entirely of carbon, which take the form of a hollow sphere, ellipsoid, or tube.\n\nAs of the early twenty-first century, the chemical and physical properties of fullerenes are still under heavy study, in both pure and applied research labs. In April 2003, fullerenes were under study for potential medicinal use&nbsp;\u2014 binding specific antibiotics to the structure to target resistant bacteria and even target certain cancer cells such as melanoma.\n\n===Carbon nanotubes===\n{{main|Carbon nanotube}}\n\nCarbon nanotubes, also called buckytubes, are cylindrical [[carbon]] [[molecules]] with novel properties that make them potentially useful in a wide variety of applications (e.g., nano-electronics, [[optics]], [[materials science|materials]] applications, etc.). They exhibit extraordinary strength, unique [[electricity|electrical]] properties, and are efficient conductors of [[heat]]. [[Inorganic nanotubes]] have also been synthesized.\nA nanotube is a member of the [[fullerene]] structural family, which also includes [[Buckyball (molecule)|buckyballs]]. Whereas buckyballs are [[spherical]] in shape, a nanotube is [[cylinder (geometry)|cylindrical]], with at least one end typically capped with a hemisphere of the buckyball structure. Their name is derived from their size, since the diameter of a nanotube is on the order of a few [[nanometer]]s (approximately 50,000 times smaller than the width of a human hair), while they can be up to several centimeters in length. There are two main types of nanotubes: [[single-walled nanotubes]] (SWNTs) and [[MWNT|multi-walled nanotubes]] (MWNTs).\n\n===Carbon nanobuds===\n[[File:NanobudComputations70%.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Computer models of stable nanobud structures]]\n{{main|Carbon nanobud}}\n'''Carbon nanobuds''' are a newly discovered allotrope of [[carbon]] in which [[fullerene]] like \"buds\" are covalently attached to the outer sidewalls of the [[carbon nanotubes]].

The name, ZTC, derives from their origin inside the pores of [[zeolite]]s, crystalline [[silicon dioxide]] minerals. A vapor of carbon-containing molecules is injected into the zeolite, where the carbon gathers on the pores' walls, creating the negative curve. Dissolving the zeolite leaves the carbon. A team generated structures by decorating the pores of a zeolite with carbon through a [[Monte Carlo method]]. Some of these structures were recognized as Schwarzites and they proposed a route to their synthesis.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://newatlas.com/schwarzite-carbon-nanostructure-negative-curvature/55882|title=Negative curvature schwarzite rounds out trinity of carbon nanostructures|last=Irving|first=Michael|date=August 13, 2018|website=newatlas.com|language=en|access-date=2018-08-16}}</ref>\n\n==Glassy carbon==\n[[File:Glassy carbon and a 1cm3 graphite cube HP68-79.jpg|thumb|left|A large sample of glassy carbon.]]\n{{main|Glassy carbon}}\n'''Glassy carbon''' or '''vitreous carbon''' is a class of non-graphitizing [[carbon]] widely used as an electrode material in [[electrochemistry]], as well as for high-temperature crucibles and as a component of some prosthetic devices.\n\nIt was first produced by Bernard Redfern in the mid-1950s at the laboratories of The Carborundum Company, Manchester, UK. He had set out to develop a polymer matrix to mirror a diamond structure and discovered a resole (phenolic) resin that would, with special preparation, set without a catalyst. Using this resin the first glassy carbon was produced.\n\nThe preparation of glassy carbon involves subjecting the organic precursors to a series of heat treatments at temperatures up to 3000&nbsp;\u00b0C. Unlike many non-graphitizing carbons, they are impermeable to gases and are chemically extremely inert, especially those prepared at very high temperatures. It has been demonstrated that the rates of oxidation of certain glassy carbons in oxygen, carbon dioxide or water vapor are lower than those of any other carbon. They are also highly resistant to attack by acids. Thus, while normal [[graphite]] is reduced to a powder by a mixture of concentrated sulfuric and nitric acids at room temperature, glassy carbon is unaffected by such treatment, even after several months.\n\n==Atomic and diatomic carbon==\n{{main|Atomic carbon|diatomic carbon}}\nUnder certain conditions, carbon can be found in its atomic form. It is formed by passing large electric currents through carbon under very low pressures. It is extremely unstable, but it is an intermittent product used in the creation of [[carbene]]s.<ref>[https://digitalcommons.colby.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1239&context=honorstheses Reactions of Atomic Carbon with Acid Chlorides].

Rode]] and co-workers at the [[Australian National University]] in [[Canberra]]. It consists of a low-density cluster-assembly of carbon atoms strung together in a loose three-dimensional web.\n\nEach cluster is about 6 nanometers wide and consists of about 4000 carbon [[atom]]s linked in [[graphite]]-like sheets that are given negative curvature by the inclusion of [[heptagon]]s among the regular [[hexagon]]al pattern. This is the opposite of what happens in the case of [[buckminsterfullerene]]s, in which carbon sheets are given positive curvature by the inclusion of [[pentagon]]s.\n\nThe large-scale structure of carbon nanofoam is similar to that of an [[aerogel]], but with 1% of the density of previously produced [[Aerogel#Carbon|carbon aerogels]] \u2013 only a few times the density of [[air]] at [[sea level]]. Unlike carbon aerogels, carbon nanofoam is a poor [[electrical conductivity|electrical conductor]].\n\n==Carbide-derived carbon==\n{{main|Carbide-derived carbon}}\nCarbide-derived carbon (CDC) is a family of carbon materials with different surface geometries and carbon ordering that are produced via selective removal of metals from metal carbide precursors, such as TiC, SiC, Ti<sub>3</sub>AlC<sub>2</sub>, Mo<sub>2</sub>C, etc. This synthesis is accomplished using chlorine treatment, hydrothermal synthesis, or high-temperature selective metal desorption under vacuum. Depending on the synthesis method, carbide precursor, and reaction parameters, multiple carbon allotropes can be achieved, including endohedral particles composed of predominantly amorphous carbon, carbon nanotubes, epitaxial graphene, nanocrystalline diamond, onion-like carbon, and graphitic ribbons, barrels, and horns. These structures exhibit high porosity and specific surface areas, with highly tunable pore diameters, making them promising materials for supercapacitor-based energy storage, water filtration and capacitive desalinization, catalyst support, and cytokine removal.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1002/adfm.201002094|title=Carbide-Derived Carbons \u2013 From Porous Networks to Nanotubes and Graphene|year=2011|author2= Heon, Min |author3=Gogotsi, Yury|journal=Advanced Functional Materials|volume=21|pages=810\u2013833|last=Presser|first=Volker|issue=5}}</ref>\n\n==Lonsdaleite (hexagonal diamond)==\n{{main|Lonsdaleite}}\n'''Lonsdaleite''' is a [[Hexagonal crystal system|hexagonal]] allotrope of the carbon allotrope [[diamond]], believed to form from [[graphite]] present in [[meteor]]ites upon their impact to [[Earth]].

The [[hardness]] and high [[Dispersion (optics)|dispersion of light]] of diamond make it useful for both industrial applications and jewelry. Diamond is the hardest known natural [[mineral]]. This makes it an excellent abrasive and makes it hold polish and luster extremely well. No known naturally occurring substance can cut (or even scratch) a diamond, except another diamond.\n\nThe market for industrial-grade diamonds operates much differently from its gem-grade counterpart. Industrial diamonds are valued mostly for their hardness and heat conductivity, making many of the [[gemology|gemological]] characteristics of diamond, including clarity and color, mostly irrelevant. This helps explain why 80% of mined diamonds (equal to about 100 million carats or 20 tonnes annually) are unsuitable for use as gemstones and known as ''[[bort]]'', are destined for industrial use. In addition to mined diamonds, [[synthetic diamond]]s found industrial applications almost immediately after their invention in the 1950s; another 400 million carats (80 tonnes) of synthetic diamonds are produced annually for industrial use, which is nearly four times the mass of natural diamonds mined over the same period.\n\nThe dominant industrial use of diamond is [[Diamond cutting|cutting]], [[Diamond drilling|drilling]] ([[drill bit]]s), [[Diamond grinding|grinding]] (diamond edged cutters), and polishing. Most uses of diamonds in these technologies do not require large diamonds; in fact, most diamonds that are not gem-quality can find an industrial use. Diamonds are embedded in drill tips or saw blades, or ground into a powder for use in grinding and polishing applications (due to its extraordinary hardness). Specialized applications include use in laboratories as containment for high pressure experiments (see [[diamond anvil]]), high-performance [[bearing (mechanical)|bearings]], and limited use in specialized [[window]]s of technical apparatuses.\n\nWith the continuing advances being made in the production of synthetic diamond, future applications are beginning to become feasible. Garnering much excitement is the possible use of diamond as a [[semiconductor]] suitable to build [[integrated circuit|microchip]]s from, or the use of diamond as a [[heat sink]] in [[electronics]]. Significant research efforts in [[Japan]], [[Europe]], and the [[United States]] are under way to capitalize on the potential offered by diamond's unique material properties, combined with increased quality and quantity of supply starting to become available from synthetic diamond manufacturers.\n\nEach carbon atom in a diamond is covalently bonded to four other carbons in a [[tetrahedron]]. These tetrahedrons together form a 3-dimensional network of six-membered carbon rings (similar to [[cyclohexane]]), in the [[chair conformation]], allowing for zero [[bond angle]] strain. This stable network of [[covalent bonds]] and hexagonal rings is the reason that diamond is so strong.  Although graphite is the most stable allotrope of carbon under standard laboratory conditions (273 or 298 K, 1 atm), a recent computational study indicated that under idealized conditions (''T'' = 0, ''p'' = 0), diamond is the most stable allotrope by 1.1 kJ/mol compared to graphite.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Grochala|first=Wojciech|date=2014-04-01|title=Diamond: Electronic Ground State of Carbon at Temperatures Approaching 0 K|journal=Angewandte Chemie International Edition|language=en|volume=53|issue=14|pages=3680\u20133683|doi=10.1002/anie.201400131|issn=1521-3773|pmid=24615828}}</ref>\n\n==Graphite==\n{{main|Graphite}}\n'''Graphite''', named by [[Abraham Gottlob Werner]] in 1789, from the Greek \u03b3\u03c1\u03ac\u03c6\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd ({{transl|grc|graphein}}, \"to draw/write\", for its use in pencils) is one of the most common allotropes of carbon. Unlike diamond, graphite is an electrical conductor. Thus, it can be used in, for instance, electrical arc lamp electrodes. Likewise, under [[standard conditions]], graphite is the most stable form of carbon. Therefore, it is used in thermochemistry as the [[standard state]] for defining the [[standard enthalpy of formation|heat of formation]] of carbon compounds.\n\nGraphite [[Electrical conductor|conducts electricity]], due to [[delocalization]] of the [[pi bond]] [[electron]]s above and below the planes of the carbon atoms. These electrons are free to move, so are able to conduct electricity. However, the electricity is only conducted along the plane of the layers. In diamond, all four outer electrons of each carbon atom are 'localized' between the atoms in covalent bonding. The movement of electrons is restricted and diamond does not conduct an electric current. In graphite, each carbon atom uses only 3 of its 4 outer energy level electrons in covalently bonding to three other carbon atoms in a plane. Each carbon atom contributes one electron to a delocalized system of electrons that is also a part of the chemical bonding. The delocalized electrons are free to move throughout the plane. For this reason, graphite conducts electricity along the planes of carbon atoms, but does not conduct in a direction at right angles to the plane.\n\nGraphite powder is used as a dry [[lubricant]]. Although it might be thought that this industrially important property is due entirely to the [[cleavage (crystal)|loose interlamellar coupling]] between sheets in the structure, in fact in a [[vacuum]] environment (such as in technologies for use in [[Outer space|space]]), graphite was found to be a very poor lubricant. This fact led to the discovery that graphite's lubricity is due to [[adsorbed]] air and water between the layers, unlike other layered dry lubricants such as [[molybdenum disulfide]]. Recent studies suggest that an effect called [[superlubricity]] can also account for this effect.\n\nWhen a large number of crystallographic defects (physical) bind these planes together, graphite loses its lubrication properties and becomes [[pyrolytic carbon]], a useful material in blood-contacting implants such as [[prosthetic]] [[heart valve]]s.\n\nGraphite is the most stable allotrope of carbon. Contrary to popular belief, high-purity graphite does not readily burn, even at elevated temperatures.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=22aTqTKRPBI Glowing nuclear reactor graphite 2].

During a fire the graphite intumesces (expands and chars) to resist fire penetration and prevent the spread of fumes. A typical start expansion temperature (SET) is between 150 and 300&nbsp;\u00b0C.\n\nDensity: graphite's specific gravity is 2.3, which makes it lighter than diamonds.\n\nChemical activity: it is slightly more reactive than diamond. This is because the reactants are able to penetrate between the hexagonal layers of carbon atoms in graphite. It is unaffected by ordinary solvents, dilute acids, or fused alkalis. However, [[chromic acid]] oxidizes it to carbon dioxide.\n\n===Graphene===\n{{main|Graphene}}\nA single layer of graphite is called [[graphene]] and has extraordinary electrical, thermal, and physical properties. It can be produced by [[epitaxy]] on an insulating or conducting substrate or by mechanical exfoliation (repeated peeling) from graphite.

They are named for the resemblance to the geodesic structures devised by [[Buckminster Fuller|Richard Buckminster \"Bucky\" Fuller]]. Fullerenes are positively curved molecules of varying sizes composed entirely of carbon, which take the form of a hollow sphere, ellipsoid, or tube.\n\nAs of the early twenty-first century, the chemical and physical properties of fullerenes are still under heavy study, in both pure and applied research labs. In April 2003, fullerenes were under study for potential medicinal use&nbsp;\u2014 binding specific antibiotics to the structure to target resistant bacteria and even target certain cancer cells such as melanoma.\n\n===Carbon nanotubes===\n{{main|Carbon nanotube}}\n\nCarbon nanotubes, also called buckytubes, are cylindrical [[carbon]] [[molecules]] with novel properties that make them potentially useful in a wide variety of applications (e.g., nano-electronics, [[optics]], [[materials science|materials]] applications, etc.). They exhibit extraordinary strength, unique [[electricity|electrical]] properties, and are efficient conductors of [[heat]]. [[Inorganic nanotubes]] have also been synthesized.\nA nanotube is a member of the [[fullerene]] structural family, which also includes [[Buckyball (molecule)|buckyballs]]. Whereas buckyballs are [[spherical]] in shape, a nanotube is [[cylinder (geometry)|cylindrical]], with at least one end typically capped with a hemisphere of the buckyball structure. Their name is derived from their size, since the diameter of a nanotube is on the order of a few [[nanometer]]s (approximately 50,000 times smaller than the width of a human hair), while they can be up to several centimeters in length. There are two main types of nanotubes: [[single-walled nanotubes]] (SWNTs) and [[MWNT|multi-walled nanotubes]] (MWNTs).\n\n===Carbon nanobuds===\n[[File:NanobudComputations70%.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Computer models of stable nanobud structures]]\n{{main|Carbon nanobud}}\n'''Carbon nanobuds''' are a newly discovered allotrope of [[carbon]] in which [[fullerene]] like \"buds\" are covalently attached to the outer sidewalls of the [[carbon nanotubes]].

The name, ZTC, derives from their origin inside the pores of [[zeolite]]s, crystalline [[silicon dioxide]] minerals. A vapor of carbon-containing molecules is injected into the zeolite, where the carbon gathers on the pores' walls, creating the negative curve. Dissolving the zeolite leaves the carbon. A team generated structures by decorating the pores of a zeolite with carbon through a [[Monte Carlo method]]. Some of these structures were recognized as Schwarzites and they proposed a route to their synthesis.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://newatlas.com/schwarzite-carbon-nanostructure-negative-curvature/55882|title=Negative curvature schwarzite rounds out trinity of carbon nanostructures|last=Irving|first=Michael|date=August 13, 2018|website=newatlas.com|language=en|access-date=2018-08-16}}</ref>\n\n==Glassy carbon==\n[[File:Glassy carbon and a 1cm3 graphite cube HP68-79.jpg|thumb|left|A large sample of glassy carbon.]]\n{{main|Glassy carbon}}\n'''Glassy carbon''' or '''vitreous carbon''' is a class of non-graphitizing [[carbon]] widely used as an electrode material in [[electrochemistry]], as well as for high-temperature crucibles and as a component of some prosthetic devices.\n\nIt was first produced by Bernard Redfern in the mid-1950s at the laboratories of The Carborundum Company, Manchester, UK. He had set out to develop a polymer matrix to mirror a diamond structure and discovered a resole (phenolic) resin that would, with special preparation, set without a catalyst. Using this resin the first glassy carbon was produced.\n\nThe preparation of glassy carbon involves subjecting the organic precursors to a series of heat treatments at temperatures up to 3000&nbsp;\u00b0C. Unlike many non-graphitizing carbons, they are impermeable to gases and are chemically extremely inert, especially those prepared at very high temperatures. It has been demonstrated that the rates of oxidation of certain glassy carbons in oxygen, carbon dioxide or water vapor are lower than those of any other carbon. They are also highly resistant to attack by acids. Thus, while normal [[graphite]] is reduced to a powder by a mixture of concentrated sulfuric and nitric acids at room temperature, glassy carbon is unaffected by such treatment, even after several months.\n\n==Atomic and diatomic carbon==\n{{main|Atomic carbon|diatomic carbon}}\nUnder certain conditions, carbon can be found in its atomic form. It is formed by passing large electric currents through carbon under very low pressures. It is extremely unstable, but it is an intermittent product used in the creation of [[carbene]]s.<ref>[https://digitalcommons.colby.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1239&context=honorstheses Reactions of Atomic Carbon with Acid Chlorides]. None. Retrieved on 2011-11-23.</ref>\n\n[[Diatomic carbon]] can also be found under certain conditions. It is often detected via [[spectroscopy]] in extraterrestrial bodies, including [[comet]]s and certain [[star]]s.<ref>{{cite book|author=Martin Harwit|title=Astrophysical concepts|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=trAAgqWZVlkC|accessdate=24 November 2011|year=1998|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-0-387-94943-7}}</ref><ref>[https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2009/04feb_greencomet/ Green Comet Approaches Earth].

Rode]] and co-workers at the [[Australian National University]] in [[Canberra]]. It consists of a low-density cluster-assembly of carbon atoms strung together in a loose three-dimensional web.\n\nEach cluster is about 6 nanometers wide and consists of about 4000 carbon [[atom]]s linked in [[graphite]]-like sheets that are given negative curvature by the inclusion of [[heptagon]]s among the regular [[hexagon]]al pattern. This is the opposite of what happens in the case of [[buckminsterfullerene]]s, in which carbon sheets are given positive curvature by the inclusion of [[pentagon]]s.\n\nThe large-scale structure of carbon nanofoam is similar to that of an [[aerogel]], but with 1% of the density of previously produced [[Aerogel#Carbon|carbon aerogels]] \u2013 only a few times the density of [[air]] at [[sea level]]. Unlike carbon aerogels, carbon nanofoam is a poor [[electrical conductivity|electrical conductor]].\n\n==Carbide-derived carbon==\n{{main|Carbide-derived carbon}}\nCarbide-derived carbon (CDC) is a family of carbon materials with different surface geometries and carbon ordering that are produced via selective removal of metals from metal carbide precursors, such as TiC, SiC, Ti<sub>3</sub>AlC<sub>2</sub>, Mo<sub>2</sub>C, etc. This synthesis is accomplished using chlorine treatment, hydrothermal synthesis, or high-temperature selective metal desorption under vacuum. Depending on the synthesis method, carbide precursor, and reaction parameters, multiple carbon allotropes can be achieved, including endohedral particles composed of predominantly amorphous carbon, carbon nanotubes, epitaxial graphene, nanocrystalline diamond, onion-like carbon, and graphitic ribbons, barrels, and horns. These structures exhibit high porosity and specific surface areas, with highly tunable pore diameters, making them promising materials for supercapacitor-based energy storage, water filtration and capacitive desalinization, catalyst support, and cytokine removal.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1002/adfm.201002094|title=Carbide-Derived Carbons \u2013 From Porous Networks to Nanotubes and Graphene|year=2011|author2= Heon, Min |author3=Gogotsi, Yury|journal=Advanced Functional Materials|volume=21|pages=810\u2013833|last=Presser|first=Volker|issue=5}}</ref>\n\n==Lonsdaleite (hexagonal diamond)==\n{{main|Lonsdaleite}}\n'''Lonsdaleite''' is a [[Hexagonal crystal system|hexagonal]] allotrope of the carbon allotrope [[diamond]], believed to form from [[graphite]] present in [[meteor]]ites upon their impact to [[Earth]].

Hexagonal diamond has also been synthesized in the laboratory, by compressing and heating graphite either in a static press or using explosives.

In graphite, the atoms are tightly bonded into sheets, but the sheets can slide easily over each other, making graphite soft.<ref>{{cite journal\n |last=Gray |first=Theodore\n |title=Gone in a Flash\n |journal=Popular Science\n |page=70\n |date=September 2009\n}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n\n*[[Superdense carbon allotropes]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{cite web|url=http://sacada.sctms.ru/|title=SACADA: Samara Carbon Allotrope Database |website=sctms.ru|author1=Davide M.

He served in 1919 for six days as President of the short-lived [[Bavarian Soviet Republic]], after which he became the head of its army. He was imprisoned for five years for his part in the armed resistance by the Soviet Republic to the central government in Berlin.<ref name=Britannica>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/598659/Ernst-Toller |title=Ernst Toller|last= |first= |work= |date= |publisher=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica |accessdate=17 Feb 2012 }}</ref> While in prison Toller wrote several plays which gained him international renown. They were performed in London and New York as well as Berlin. In the year 2000, several of his plays were published in an English translation.\n\nIn 1933 Toller was exiled from Germany after the [[Nazis]] came to power. He did a lecture tour in 1936-1937 in the United States and Canada, settling in California for a while before going to New York. He joined other exiles there. Struggling financially and depressed at learning his brother and sister had been sent to a [[concentration camp]] in Germany, he committed suicide in May 1939.\n\n== Life and career ==\nToller was born in 1893 into a [[Jewish]] family in [[Szamocin|Samotschin (Szamocin)]], [[Province of Posen]], [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]] (now [[Pozna\u0144]], Poland). He was the son of Ida (Kohn) and Max Toller, a pharmacist. His parents ran a general store.<ref>[https://books.google.ca/books?id=jAr6iCh4_HAC&pg=PA2&dq=Ernst+Toller+Ida,+nee+Kohn,+and+his+father,+Max&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjy-qmS3vHeAhWnt1kKHWHuCwAQ6AEIFDAA]</ref> He had a sister and brother. They grew up speaking Yiddish and German, and he later became fluent in English. \n\nAt the outbreak of [[World War I]], he volunteered for military duty. After serving for 13 months on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]],<ref name=Britannica /> he suffered a complete physical and psychological collapse. His first drama, ''Transformation'' (''Die Wandlung'', 1919), was wrought from his wartime experiences.\n[[File:Max Weber 1917.jpg|thumb|left|Ernst Toller (center) and [[Max Weber]] (foreground, bearded) in May 1917 at the Lauensteiner Tagung]]\n[[File:Fritz Kortner in Die Wandlung 1919.jpg|thumb|Karlheinz Martin's production of ''Transformation'' in Berlin with [[Fritz Kortner]] as the war returnee, 30 September 1919]]\nTogether with leading [[anarchists]], such as [[B. Traven]] and [[Gustav Landauer]], and [[communist]]s, Toller was involved in the short-lived 1919 [[Bavarian Soviet Republic]]. He served as President from April 6 to April 12. His government did little to restore order in [[Munich]]. His government members were not always well-chosen. For instance, the Foreign Affairs Deputy Dr. {{Interlanguage link multi|Franz Lipp|fr|vertical-align=sup}} (who had been admitted several times to psychiatric hospitals) informed [[Vladimir Lenin]] via cable that the ousted former Minister President, [[Johannes Hoffmann (SPD)|Johannes Hoffmann]], had fled to [[Bamberg]] and taken the key to the ministry toilet with him.  On Palm Sunday, April 1919, the [[Communist Party of Germany|Communist Party]] seized power, with [[Eugen Levin\u00e9]] as their leader.<ref>{{cite book| url=https://books.google.com/?id=-X4jgPG0360C&pg=PA58&lpg=PA58&dq=bavarian+republic+levine+coup#v=onepage&q=bavarian%20republic%20levine%20coup&f=false| author=Jeffrey S.

He was sentenced to five years in prison and served his sentence in the prisons of [[Stadelheim Prison|Stadelheim]], Neuburg, [[Eichst\u00e4tt]]. From February 1920 until his release, he was in the fortress of [[Niedersch\u00f6nenfeld]], where he spent 149 days in solitary confinement and 24 days on hunger strike.<ref>{{cite book|last=Dove|first=Richard|title=He Was a German: A Biography of Ernst Toller|year=1990|publisher=Libris|location=London|isbn=1870352858|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/hewasgermanbiogr0000dove}}</ref>\n\nHis time in prison was productive; he completed work on ''Transformation'', which premiered in Berlin under the direction of [[Karlheinz Martin]] in September 1919. At the time of this work's 100th performance, the Bavarian government offered Toller a pardon. He refused it out of solidarity with other [[political prisoner]]s. Toller continued writing in prison, completing some of what would be his most celebrated works, including the dramas ''Masses Man'' (''Masse Mensch''), ''The Machine Breakers'' (''Die Maschinenst\u00fcrmer''), ''Hinkemann, the German'' (''Der deutsche Hinkemann''), and many poems. These works established him as an important German expressionist playwright, and they used symbols derived from the First World War and its aftermath in his society.\n\nNot until after his release from prison in July 1925 was Toller able to see any of his plays performed. In 1925, the most famous of his later dramas, ''[[Hoppla, We're Alive!]]'' (''Hoppla, wir Leben!''), directed by [[Erwin Piscator]], premiered in Berlin. It tells of a  revolutionary discharged from a mental hospital after eight years, who discovers that his former comrades have grown complacent and compromised within the system they once opposed. In despair, he kills himself.<ref>Pearlman, Alan Raphael, ed. and trans. 2000. ''Plays One: Transformation, Masses Man, Hoppla, We're Alive!.'' By Ernst Toller. Absolute Classics series.

Intellectuals as Leaders and Critics\" published in 2013 by Fairleigh Dickinson University Press.\n\n==Exile ==\nIn 1933, after the [[Nazi]] rise to power, Toller was exiled from Germany because of his work; the Nazis did not like modernist arts of any form. His citizenship was nullified by the Nazi government later that year. He traveled to London with 16 year old [[Christiane Grautoff]]; they married in London in 1935, the same year he participated as co-director in the Manchester production of his play ''Rake Out the Fires'' (''Feuer aus den Kesseln'').\n\nIn 1936 and 1937, Toller went on a lecture tour of the United States and Canada, settling in California. Fluent in English, he wrote screenplays but could not get them produced. In 1936 he moved to New York City, where he joined a group of artists and writers in exile, including [[Klaus Mann]], [[Erika Mann]] (at one time married to the poet [[W.H. Auden]], who was also in the US), and [[Therese Giehse]]. He earned some money from journalism.\n\nTwo of his early plays were produced in New York in this period: ''The Machine Wreckers'' (1922), whose opening night in 1937 he attended, and ''No More Peace'', produced in 1937 by the [[Federal Theatre Project]] and presented in New York City in 1938. Their sense of immediacy was gone: the first play was related to the First World War and its aftermath, and the second an earlier period of the rise of the Nazis. Their style was outmoded for New York, and the poor reception added to Toller's discouragement.<ref name=\"bauland\">[https://books.google.com/books?id=wb_JWr4XSdsC&pg=PA112&lpg=PA112&dq=Bloody+Laughter+by+Toller&source=bl&ots=fz99o2nQiD&sig=2AcLYtR2W33cz9FpevOBeR2LmvM&hl=en&sa=X&ei=YlgzUrPEB4aLqQHQyYDAAg&ved=0CC4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=Bloody%20Laughter%20by%20Toller&f=false Peter Bauland, ''The Hooded Eagle: Modern German Drama on the New York Stage''], Syracuse University Press, 1968, pp. 112-114</ref>\n\nSuffering from deep [[depression (mood)|depression]] after learning that his sister and brother had been arrested and sent to [[concentration camp]]s, and struggling with financial woes (he had given all his money to [[Spanish Civil War]] refugees), Toller committed [[suicide]] on May 22, 1939.

He served in 1919 for six days as President of the short-lived [[Bavarian Soviet Republic]], after which he became the head of its army. He was imprisoned for five years for his part in the armed resistance by the Soviet Republic to the central government in Berlin.<ref name=Britannica>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/598659/Ernst-Toller |title=Ernst Toller|last= |first= |work= |date= |publisher=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica |accessdate=17 Feb 2012 }}</ref> While in prison Toller wrote several plays which gained him international renown. They were performed in London and New York as well as Berlin. In the year 2000, several of his plays were published in an English translation.\n\nIn 1933 Toller was exiled from Germany after the [[Nazis]] came to power. He did a lecture tour in 1936-1937 in the United States and Canada, settling in California for a while before going to New York. He joined other exiles there. Struggling financially and depressed at learning his brother and sister had been sent to a [[concentration camp]] in Germany, he committed suicide in May 1939.\n\n== Life and career ==\nToller was born in 1893 into a [[Jewish]] family in [[Szamocin|Samotschin (Szamocin)]], [[Province of Posen]], [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]] (now [[Pozna\u0144]], Poland). He was the son of Ida (Kohn) and Max Toller, a pharmacist. His parents ran a general store.<ref>[https://books.google.ca/books?id=jAr6iCh4_HAC&pg=PA2&dq=Ernst+Toller+Ida,+nee+Kohn,+and+his+father,+Max&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjy-qmS3vHeAhWnt1kKHWHuCwAQ6AEIFDAA]</ref> He had a sister and brother. They grew up speaking Yiddish and German, and he later became fluent in English. \n\nAt the outbreak of [[World War I]], he volunteered for military duty. After serving for 13 months on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]],<ref name=Britannica /> he suffered a complete physical and psychological collapse. His first drama, ''Transformation'' (''Die Wandlung'', 1919), was wrought from his wartime experiences. Update: Kafka wrote Transformation not Toller.\n[[File:Max Weber 1917.jpg|thumb|left|Ernst Toller (center) and [[Max Weber]] (foreground, bearded) in May 1917 at the Lauensteiner Tagung]]\n[[File:Fritz Kortner in Die Wandlung 1919.jpg|thumb|Karlheinz Martin's production of ''Transformation'' in Berlin with [[Fritz Kortner]] as the war returnee, 30 September 1919]]\nTogether with leading [[anarchists]], such as [[B. Traven]] and [[Gustav Landauer]], and [[communist]]s, Toller was involved in the short-lived 1919 [[Bavarian Soviet Republic]]. He served as President from April 6 to April 12. His government did little to restore order in [[Munich]]. His government members were not always well-chosen. For instance, the Foreign Affairs Deputy Dr. {{Interlanguage link multi|Franz Lipp|fr|vertical-align=sup}} (who had been admitted several times to psychiatric hospitals) informed [[Vladimir Lenin]] via cable that the ousted former Minister President, [[Johannes Hoffmann (SPD)|Johannes Hoffmann]], had fled to [[Bamberg]] and taken the key to the ministry toilet with him.  On Palm Sunday, April 1919, the [[Communist Party of Germany|Communist Party]] seized power, with [[Eugen Levin\u00e9]] as their leader.<ref>{{cite book| url=https://books.google.com/?id=-X4jgPG0360C&pg=PA58&lpg=PA58&dq=bavarian+republic+levine+coup#v=onepage&q=bavarian%20republic%20levine%20coup&f=false| author=Jeffrey S.

He was sentenced to five years in prison and served his sentence in the prisons of [[Stadelheim Prison|Stadelheim]], Neuburg, [[Eichst\u00e4tt]]. From February 1920 until his release, he was in the fortress of [[Niedersch\u00f6nenfeld]], where he spent 149 days in solitary confinement and 24 days on hunger strike.<ref>{{cite book|last=Dove|first=Richard|title=He Was a German: A Biography of Ernst Toller|year=1990|publisher=Libris|location=London|isbn=1870352858|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/hewasgermanbiogr0000dove}}</ref>\n\nHis time in prison was productive; he completed work on ''Transformation'', which premiered in Berlin under the direction of [[Karlheinz Martin]] in September 1919. At the time of this work's 100th performance, the Bavarian government offered Toller a pardon. He refused it out of solidarity with other [[political prisoner]]s. Toller continued writing in prison, completing some of what would be his most celebrated works, including the dramas ''Masses Man'' (''Masse Mensch''), ''The Machine Breakers'' (''Die Maschinenst\u00fcrmer''), ''Hinkemann, the German'' (''Der deutsche Hinkemann''), and many poems. These works established him as an important German expressionist playwright, and they used symbols derived from the First World War and its aftermath in his society.\n\nNot until after his release from prison in July 1925 was Toller able to see any of his plays performed. In 1925, the most famous of his later dramas, ''[[Hoppla, We're Alive!]]'' (''Hoppla, wir Leben!''), directed by [[Erwin Piscator]], premiered in Berlin. It tells of a  revolutionary discharged from a mental hospital after eight years, who discovers that his former comrades have grown complacent and compromised within the system they once opposed. In despair, he kills himself.<ref>Pearlman, Alan Raphael, ed. and trans. 2000. ''Plays One: Transformation, Masses Man, Hoppla, We're Alive!.'' By Ernst Toller. Absolute Classics series.

Intellectuals as Leaders and Critics\" published in 2013 by Fairleigh Dickinson University Press.\n\n==Exile ==\nIn 1933, after the [[Nazi]] rise to power, Toller was exiled from Germany because of his work; the Nazis did not like modernist arts of any form. His citizenship was nullified by the Nazi government later that year. He traveled to London with 16 year old [[Christiane Grautoff]]; they married in London in 1935, the same year he participated as co-director in the Manchester production of his play ''Rake Out the Fires'' (''Feuer aus den Kesseln'').\n\nIn 1936 and 1937, Toller went on a lecture tour of the United States and Canada, settling in California. Fluent in English, he wrote screenplays but could not get them produced. In 1936 he moved to New York City, where he joined a group of artists and writers in exile, including [[Klaus Mann]], [[Erika Mann]] (at one time married to the poet [[W.H. Auden]], who was also in the US), and [[Therese Giehse]]. He earned some money from journalism.\n\nTwo of his early plays were produced in New York in this period: ''The Machine Wreckers'' (1922), whose opening night in 1937 he attended, and ''No More Peace'', produced in 1937 by the [[Federal Theatre Project]] and presented in New York City in 1938. Their sense of immediacy was gone: the first play was related to the First World War and its aftermath, and the second an earlier period of the rise of the Nazis. Their style was outmoded for New York, and the poor reception added to Toller's discouragement.<ref name=\"bauland\">[https://books.google.com/books?id=wb_JWr4XSdsC&pg=PA112&lpg=PA112&dq=Bloody+Laughter+by+Toller&source=bl&ots=fz99o2nQiD&sig=2AcLYtR2W33cz9FpevOBeR2LmvM&hl=en&sa=X&ei=YlgzUrPEB4aLqQHQyYDAAg&ved=0CC4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=Bloody%20Laughter%20by%20Toller&f=false Peter Bauland, ''The Hooded Eagle: Modern German Drama on the New York Stage''], Syracuse University Press, 1968, pp. 112-114</ref>\n\nSuffering from deep [[depression (mood)|depression]] after learning that his sister and brother had been arrested and sent to [[concentration camp]]s, and struggling with financial woes (he had given all his money to [[Spanish Civil War]] refugees), Toller committed [[suicide]] on May 22, 1939.
