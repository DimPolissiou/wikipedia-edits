(Genesis 14:18), The [[Midrash]] and [[Babylonian Talmud]] maintain that the priesthood held by [[Melchizedek]], who pre-dated the patriarch Levi by five generations (Melchizedek pre-dates Aaron by six generations; Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Levi, Kehoth, Amram, Aaron) was given in his stead to Abraham who, in turn, passed it on to his patrilineal descendants, Isaac and then to Jacob. Midrashic literature attributes this transition as a consequence due to Melchizedek preceding the name of [[Abraham]] to that of God, such as in the [[Midrash Rabbah]] to Genesis. Tractate Nedarim. While some Jewish commentators, such as [[Chaim ibn Attar]], write that Melchizedek gave the priesthood to Abraham willingly.\n\n[[Maimonides]], in his Mishna Torah compilation, explains that [[Jacob]] separated his son [[Levi]] from his other sons and appointed him to instruct and teach the ways of 'service to God', specifically the servicial methods used by his forefather [[Abraham]], to his brothers. He also instructed his sons to perpetuate this status of Levi (\"Shevet Levi\") for eternity (Maimonides, Avodah Zorah 1:15). For the prelude of this choice see [[Targum Yonathan]] to Genesis 32:25, and/or [[Pirkei de-Rabbi Eliezer]] ch. 37.

According to the writer of [[Epistle to the Hebrews|Hebrews]] (7:13-17) Jesus is considered a priest in the order of Melchizedek because, like Melchizedek, Jesus was not a [[Kohen|descendant of Aaron]], and thus would not qualify for the Jewish priesthood under the [[Law of Moses]].\n\nMelchizedek is referred to again in [[Epistle to the Hebrews|Hebrews]] 5:6-10; Hebrews 6:20; Hebrews 7:1-21: \"Thou art a priest forever after the order of Melchizedek\"; and Hebrews 8:1.\n\n<blockquote>And verily they that are of the sons of Levi, who receive the office of the priesthood, have a commandment to take tithes of the people according to the law, that is, of their brethren, though they come out of the loins of Abraham: But he whose descent is not counted from them received tithes of Abraham, and blessed him that had the promises\" (Hebrews 7:5-6).</blockquote>\n<blockquote>If therefore perfection were by the Levitical priesthood, (for under it the people received the law,) what further need was there that another priest should rise after the order of Melchisedec, and not be called after the order of Aaron? For the priesthood being changed, there is made of necessity a change also of the law\" (Hebrews 7:11-12).</blockquote>\n\nThe author of the [[Epistle to the Hebrews]] in the [[New Testament]] discussed this subject considerably, listing the following reasons for why the priesthood of Melchizedek is superior to the Aaronic priesthood:\n\n#Abraham paid tithes to Melchizedek; later, the Levites would receive tithes from their countrymen. Since Aaron was in Abraham's loins then, it was as if the Aaronic priesthood were paying tithes to Melchizedek. (Heb. 7:4-10)\n#The one who blesses is always greater than the one being blessed. Thus, Melchizedek was greater than Abraham.  As Levi was yet in the loins of Abraham, it follows that Melchizedek is greater than Levi. (Heb. 7:7-10)\n#If the priesthood of Aaron were effective, God would not have called a new priest in a different order in Psalm 110. (Heb. 7:11)\n#The basis of the Aaronic priesthood was ancestry; the basis of the priesthood of Melchizedek is everlasting life. That is, there is no interruption due to a priest's death. (Heb. 7:8,15-16,23-25)\n#Christ, being sinless, does not need a sacrifice for his own sins. (Heb. 7:26-27)\n#The priesthood of Melchizedek is more effective because it required a single sacrifice once and for all (Jesus), while the Levitical priesthood made endless sacrifices. (Heb. 7:27)\n#The [[kohen|Aaronic priests]] serve (or, rather, served) in an earthly copy and shadow of the heavenly Temple, which Jesus serves in. (Heb. 8:5)\n\nThe epistle goes on to say that the [[New Covenant (theology)|covenant]] of Jesus is superior to the [[Mosaic Covenant|covenant]] the Levitical priesthood is under. Some Christians hold that Melchizedek was a [[Typology (theology)|type]] of Christ, and some other Christians hold that Melchizedek indeed ''was'' Christ. Reasons provided include that Melchizedek's name means \"king of righteousness\" according to the author of Hebrews, and that being king of Salem makes Melchizedek the \"king of peace.\" Heb. 7:3 states, \"Without father or mother, without genealogy, without beginning of days or end of life, like the Son of God he (Melchizedek) remains a priest forever.\" Melchizedek gave Abraham bread and wine, which some Christians consider symbols of the body and blood of Jesus Christ, the sacrifice to confirm a covenant.\n\n===Catholicism===\n[[Catholicism|Catholics]] find the roots of their priesthood in the tradition of Melchizedek.

Of particular importance is the parallel Hebrew meaning of \"prince of peace\" and \"king of Salem\", another of Melchizedek's titles, and his association with (or typology of) Jesus Christ, who is also called the Prince of Peace (Isa. 9:2), as well as the Great High Priest (Heb. 4:14). Later, Melchizedek's people were, according to [[Joseph Smith]], caught up, or \"[[Translation (LDS Church)|translated]]\", to meet the city of Enoch ([[Joseph Smith Translation]] of Genesis 14:34).

The current $5 bill features the 16th [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] (1861-65), [[Abraham Lincoln]]'s portrait on the front and the [[Lincoln Memorial]] on the back. All $5 bills issued today are [[Federal Reserve Note]]s. \n\nThe $5 bill is sometimes nicknamed a \"fin\". The term has [[German language|German]]/[[Yiddish language|Yiddish]] roots and is remotely related to the [[English language|English]] \"five\", but it is far less common today than it was in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ceifx.com/news/776/5-Currency-Facts-You-Probably-Didnt-Know-About-the-US-5-Dollar-Bill|title=5 Currency Facts You Probably Didn't Know About the US $5 Dollar Bill {{!}} Currency Exchange International, Corp|website=www.ceifx.com|access-date=2020-01-16}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Bureau of Engraving and Printing]] says the average life of a $5 bill in circulation is 5.5 years before it is replaced due to wear.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.federalreserve.gov/faqs/how-long-is-the-life-span-of-us-paper-money.htm|title=The Fed - FAQs|publisher=}}</ref> Approximately 6% of all paper currency produced by the U.S. Treasury's Bureau of Engraving and Printing in 2009 were $5 bills.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=Bureau of Engraving and Printing|title=Money Facts|url=http://www.moneyfactory.gov/document.cfm/18/2230|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051206012921/http://www.moneyfactory.gov/document.cfm/18/2230|archivedate=2005-12-06}}</ref>\n\n==Current design==\n[[File:Abraham Lincoln, President, U.S - NARA - 528388.jpg|thumb|250px|left|upright|[[Mathew Brady]] portrait of Lincoln taken on February 9, 1864, used for the current $5 bill.<ref>{{cite web|author1=Fred L.

Note that this image is a mirror of Lincoln as he appears on the bill - this is because the daguerreotype process produced a single positive image (rather than a [[Negative (photography)|negative]] made on [[photographic film|film]], which is then used to make a true [[Photographic printing|photographic positive]]), and the daguerreotype was always a mirror image of the subject material. Thus, the way Lincoln appears on the bill is actually how he appeared when seated for the picture.]]-->\n\nThe redesigned $5 bill was unveiled on September 20, 2007, and was issued on March 13, 2008 during a ceremony at [[President Lincoln's Cottage]].\n\n===Security Features===\nNew and enhanced security features make it easier to check the new $5 bill and more difficult for potential counterfeiters to reproduce. The redesigned $5 bill has:\n\n*'''Watermarks:''' There are now two watermarks. A large numeral \"5\" watermark is located in a blank space to the right of the portrait, replacing the watermark portrait of President Lincoln found on previous bills. A second watermark \u2014 a new column of three smaller \"5\"s \u2014 has been added and is positioned to the left of the portrait.\n*'''Security thread:''' The embedded security thread runs vertically and is now located to the right of the portrait. The letters \"USA\" followed by the number \"5\" in an alternating pattern are visible along the thread from both sides of the bill. The thread glows blue when held under ultraviolet light ([[blacklight]]).<ref>{{cite web|title=uscurrency.gov.gov - The Redesigned $5 Note|url=https://uscurrency.gov/security/5-security-features-2008-present|publisher=US Currency Education Program}}</ref>\n*'''Microprinting:''' The redesigned $5 bill features [[microprinting]], which is the engraving of tiny text, on the front of the bill in three areas: the words \"FIVE DOLLARS\" can be found repeated inside the left and right borders of the bill; the words \"E PLURIBUS UNUM\" appear at the top of the shield within the Great Seal; and the word \"USA\" is repeated in between the columns of the shield. On the back of the bill the words \"USA FIVE\" appear along one edge of the large purple \"5\". Because they are so small, these microprinted words are hard to replicate.\n*'''Red and Blue Threads:''' Some small red and blue threads are embedded into the paper to reveal if a higher denomination counterfeit bill has been printed on the bleached paper of a genuine lower denomination bill.\n\n[[File:Series 2009 Five Dollar Bill in Infrared.jpg|thumb|250px|right|The reverse of the five-dollar bill has two rectangular strips that are blanked out when viewed in the infrared spectrum, as seen in this image taken by an infrared camera.]]\n\n*'''Infrared Ink:''' The back of the five-dollar bill features sections of the bill that are blanked out when viewed in the [[infrared]] spectrum. This is consistent with other high-value US bills ($5 and up), which all feature patterns of infrared-visible stripes unique to the given denomination. Bills of other world currencies, such as the [[Euro]], also feature unique patterns visible only when viewed in this spectrum.\n*'''Anti-Photocopy Circle Pattern:''' Small yellow \"05\"s are printed to the left of the portrait on the front of the bill and to the right of the Lincoln Memorial vignette on the back. The zeros in the \"05\"s form a \"[[EURion constellation]]\" to prevent photocopying of the bill. Photocopy machines detect the particular pattern of yellow circles and refuse to make a copy. Some machines make a record of the illegal photocopy attempt, which a repair technician may report to law enforcement.\n\nThe five dollar bill lacks the [[optically variable ink]] of higher denomination US bills.\n\n===Design features===\nThe new $5 bills remain the same size and use the same\u2014but enhanced\u2014portraits and historical images. The most noticeable difference is the light-purple coloring of the center of the bill, which blends into gray near the edges.\n\nSimilar to the recently redesigned $10, $20, $50, and $100 bills, the new $5 bill features an American symbol of freedom printed in the background: The [[Great Seal of the United States]], featuring an eagle and shield, is printed in purple to the right of the portrait and an arc of purple stars surround both it and the portrait.\n\nWhen the Lincoln Memorial was constructed the names of 48 states were engraved on it. The picture of the Lincoln Memorial on the $5 bill only contains the names of 26 states. These are the 26 states that can be seen on the front side of the Lincoln memorial which is what is pictured on the $5 bill.\n\nOn the back of the bill, a larger, purple numeral \"5\" appears in the lower right corner to help those with visual impairments to distinguish the denomination. This large \"5\" also includes the words \"USA FIVE\" in tiny white letters.\n\nThe oval borders around President Lincoln's portrait on the front, and the Lincoln Memorial vignette on the back have been removed. Both engravings have been enhanced.\n\n==Redesign==\nOn April 20, 2016, [[Secretary of the Treasury|Treasury Secretary]] [[Jacob Lew]] announced that the $5, $10, and $20 would all undergo redesign prior to 2020. The changes would add new features to combat counterfeiting and make them easier for blind citizens to distinguish. Lew said that while Lincoln would remain on the obverse, the reverse would be redesigned to depict various historical events that had occurred at the Lincoln Memorial. Among the planned designs are images from the [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] [[I Have a Dream]] speech and the 1939 concert by opera singer [[Marian Anderson]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2016/04/20/report-lew-considered-anthony-10-bill/83274530/|title=Anti-slavery activist Harriet Tubman to replace Jackson on $20 bill|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n==Large size note history==\n[[File:US-$5-LT-1862-Fr-61a.jpg|thumb|200px|left|1862 $5 Legal Tender note]]\n[[File:US-$5-LT-1880-Fr-72.jpg|thumb|200px|left|1880 $5 [[United States Note|Legal Tender]]]]\n[[File:US-$5-SC-1891-Fr.266.jpg|thumb|200px|right|1891 $5 Silver Certificate depicting [[:en: Ulysses Grant|Ulysses S.

The obverse featured vignettes of [[Christopher Columbus]] sighting land and Columbus with an Indian Princess; the reverse featured US gold coins.\n*1875: The series 1869 United States Note was revised. The green tinting that was present on the obverse was removed and the design on the reverse was completely changed.\n*1886: The first $5 [[Silver certificate (United States)|silver certificate]] was issued with a portrait of [[Ulysses Grant|Ulysses S. Grant]] on the obverse and five [[Morgan silver dollar]]s on the reverse.\n*1890: Five-dollar Treasury or \"Coin Notes\" were issued and given for government purchases of silver bullion from the silver mining industry. The reverse featured an ornate design that occupied almost the entire note.\n*1891: The reverse of the 1890 Treasury Note was redesigned because the treasury felt that it was too \"busy\" which would make it too easy to [[counterfeit]].\n*1891: The reverse of the 1886 Silver Certificate was revised; the 5 Morgan silver dollars were removed.\n*1896: The famous \"[[Educational Series]]\" Silver Certificate was issued. The entire obverse was covered with artwork representing [[electricity]] and the reverse featured portraits of [[Ulysses S. Grant|Ulysses Grant]] and [[Phillip Sheridan]].\n*1899: A new $5 silver certificate with a portrait of [[Running Antelope]] on the face was issued.\n*1914: The first $5 [[Federal Reserve Note]] was issued with a portrait of [[Abraham Lincoln|Lincoln]] on the obverse and vignettes of Columbus sighting land and the Pilgrims' landing on the reverse. The note initially had a red [[Seal of the United States Department of the Treasury|treasury seal]] and serial numbers; however, they were changed to blue.\n*1915: [[Federal reserve bank note|Federal Reserve Bank Notes]] (not to be confused with Federal Reserve Notes) were issued by 5 Federal Reserve Banks. The obverse was similar to the 1914 Federal Reserve Notes, except for large wording in the middle of the bill and a portrait with no border on the left side of the bill. Each note was an obligation of the issuing bank and could only be redeemed at the corresponding bank.\n*1918: The 1915 Federal Reserve Bank Note was re-issued under series 1918 by 11 Federal Reserve banks.\n*1923: The $5 silver certificate was redesigned; it was nicknamed a \"porthole\" note due to the circular wording of <small>THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA</small> around Lincoln's portrait. The reverse featured the [[Great Seal of the United States]].\n\n==Small size note history==\n''(6.14 \u00d7 2.61 in \u2245 156 \u00d7 66&nbsp;mm)''\n[[File:US-$5-LT-1928-Fr.1525.jpg|thumb|200px|left|The first small-size $5 United States Note printed (Smithsonian).]]\n[[File:US-$5-FRN-1934-A-Fr.2302.jpg|thumb|200px|right|[[Hawaii overprint note]].]]\n[[File:US-$5-SC-1953-Fr.1655.jpg|thumb|200px|left|The first 1953 $5 Silver Certificate printed (Smithsonian).]]\n\n*1929: Under the [[Series of 1928 (United States Currency)|Series of 1928]], all [[small-sized note]]s carried a standardized design. All $5 bills would feature a portrait of Lincoln, the same border design on the [[obverse]], and the Lincoln Memorial on the [[Obverse and reverse|reverse]]. The $5 bill was issued as a [[United States Note]] with a red seal and serial numbers and as a [[Federal Reserve Note]] with a green seal and serial numbers.\n*1933: As an emergency response to the [[Great Depression]], additional money was pumped into the American economy through Federal Reserve Bank Notes. This was the only small-sized $5 bill that had a different border design. The serial numbers and seal on it were brown.\n*1934: The redeemable in gold clause was removed from Federal Reserve Notes due to the U.S. withdrawing from the [[gold standard]].\n*1934: The first $5 [[Silver certificate (United States)|silver certificates]] were issued with a blue seal and serial numbers along with a blue numeral 5 on the left side of the obverse.\n*1942: Special [[World War II]] [[HAWAII Overprint Note|currency was issued.]] <small>HAWAII</small> was overprinted on the front and back of the $5 Federal Reserve Note; the serial numbers, and seal, were changed to brown from green. This was done so that the currency could be declared worthless if there was a [[Japanese people|Japanese]] invasion. A $5 silver certificate was printed with a yellow instead of blue treasury seal; these notes were for U.S. troops in North Africa. These notes, too, could be declared worthless if seized by the enemy.\n*1950: Many minor aspects on the obverse of the $5 Federal Reserve Note were changed. Most noticeably, the treasury seal, gray word <small>FIVE</small>, and the Federal Reserve Seal were made smaller; also, the Federal Reserve seal had spikes added around it, like the Treasury seal.\n*1953: New $5 United States Notes and Silver Certificates were issued with a gray numeral 5 on the left side of the bill and the gray word <small>FIVE</small> with a blue seal imprinted over it on the right and blue serial numbers.\n*1963: Both the $5 United States Note and Federal Reserve Note were revised with the motto <small>IN GOD WE TRUST</small> added to the reverse and <small>WILL PAY TO THE BEARER ON DEMAND</small> removed from the obverse. Also, the obligation on the Federal Reserve Note was shortened to its current wording, <small>THIS NOTE IS LEGAL TENDER FOR ALL DEBTS PUBLIC AND PRIVATE</small>. Also during this time, production of Silver Certificates end, including the $5.\n*1967: Production of the $5 United States Note ends.\n*1969: The $5 bill began using the new treasury seal with wording in [[English language|English]] instead of [[Latin]].\n*1992: The first notes at the Western Currency Facility in [[Fort Worth, Texas]] begin printing in July, during production of Series 1988A.\n*1994: The first new-age anti-counterfeiting measures were introduced with microscopic printing around Lincoln's portrait and a plastic security strip on the left side of the bill. Even though the series date was Series 1993, they weren't printed until November 1994.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uspapermoney.info/serials/f1993_q.html|title=USPaperMoney.Info: Series 1993 $5|website=www.uspapermoney.info}}</ref>\n*May 24, 2000: To combat evolving [[counterfeit]]ing, a new $5 note, the first complete redesign since 1929, was issued under series 1999 whose design was similar in style to the $100, $50, $20, and $10 bills that had all undergone previous design changes. The $5 bill, however, does not feature color-shifting ink like all the other denominations.

The current $5 bill features the 16th [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] (1861-65), [[Abraham Lincoln]]'s portrait on the front and the [[Lincoln Memorial]] on the back. All $5 bills issued today are [[Federal Reserve Note]]s. \n\nThe $5 bill is sometimes nicknamed a \"fin\". The term has [[German language|German]]/[[Yiddish language|Yiddish]] roots and is remotely related to the [[English language|English]] \"five\", but it is far less common today than it was in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ceifx.com/news/776/5-Currency-Facts-You-Probably-Didnt-Know-About-the-US-5-Dollar-Bill|title=5 Currency Facts You Probably Didn't Know About the US $5 Dollar Bill {{!}} Currency Exchange International, Corp|website=www.ceifx.com|access-date=2020-01-16}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Bureau of Engraving and Printing]] says the average life of a $5 bill in circulation is 5.5 years before it is replaced due to wear.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.federalreserve.gov/faqs/how-long-is-the-life-span-of-us-paper-money.htm|title=The Fed - FAQs|publisher=}}</ref> Approximately 6% of all paper currency produced by the U.S. Treasury's Bureau of Engraving and Printing in 2009 were $5 bills.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=Bureau of Engraving and Printing|title=Money Facts|url=http://www.moneyfactory.gov/document.cfm/18/2230|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051206012921/http://www.moneyfactory.gov/document.cfm/18/2230|archivedate=2005-12-06}}</ref>\n\n==Current design==\n[[File:Abraham Lincoln, President, U.S - NARA - 528388.jpg|thumb|250px|left|upright|[[Mathew Brady]] portrait of Lincoln taken on February 9, 1864, used for the current $5 bill.<ref>{{cite web|author1=Fred L.

Note that this image is a mirror of Lincoln as he appears on the bill - this is because the daguerreotype process produced a single positive image (rather than a [[Negative (photography)|negative]] made on [[photographic film|film]], which is then used to make a true [[Photographic printing|photographic positive]]), and the daguerreotype was always a mirror image of the subject material. Thus, the way Lincoln appears on the bill is actually how he appeared when seated for the picture.]]-->\n\nThe redesigned $5 bill was unveiled on September 20, 2007, and was issued on March 13, 2008 during a ceremony at [[President Lincoln's Cottage]].\n\n===Security Features===\nNew and enhanced security features make it easier to check the new $5 bill and more difficult for potential counterfeiters to reproduce. The redesigned $5 bill has:\n\n*'''Watermarks:''' There are now two watermarks. A large numeral \"5\" watermark is located in a blank space to the right of the portrait, replacing the watermark portrait of President Lincoln found on previous bills. A second watermark \u2014 a new column of three smaller \"5\"s \u2014 has been added and is positioned to the left of the portrait.\n*'''Security thread:''' The embedded security thread runs vertically and is now located to the right of the portrait. The letters \"USA\" followed by the number \"5\" in an alternating pattern are visible along the thread from both sides of the bill. The thread glows blue when held under ultraviolet light ([[blacklight]]).<ref>{{cite web|title=uscurrency.gov.gov - The Redesigned $5 Note|url=https://uscurrency.gov/security/5-security-features-2008-present|publisher=US Currency Education Program}}</ref>\n*'''Microprinting:''' The redesigned $5 bill features [[microprinting]], which is the engraving of tiny text, on the front of the bill in three areas: the words \"FIVE DOLLARS\" can be found repeated inside the left and right borders of the bill; the words \"E PLURIBUS UNUM\" appear at the top of the shield within the Great Seal; and the word \"USA\" is repeated in between the columns of the shield. On the back of the bill the words \"USA FIVE\" appear along one edge of the large purple \"5\". Because they are so small, these microprinted words are hard to replicate.\n*'''Red and Blue Threads:''' Some small red and blue threads are embedded into the paper to reveal if a higher denomination counterfeit bill has been printed on the bleached paper of a genuine lower denomination bill.\n\n[[File:Series 2009 Five Dollar Bill in Infrared.jpg|thumb|250px|right|The reverse of the five-dollar bill has two rectangular strips that are blanked out when viewed in the infrared spectrum, as seen in this image taken by an infrared camera.]]\n\n*'''Infrared Ink:''' The back of the five-dollar bill features sections of the bill that are blanked out when viewed in the [[infrared]] spectrum. This is consistent with other high-value US bills ($5 and up), which all feature patterns of infrared-visible stripes unique to the given denomination. Bills of other world currencies, such as the [[Euro]], also feature unique patterns visible only when viewed in this spectrum.\n*'''Anti-Photocopy Circle Pattern:''' Small yellow \"05\"s are printed to the left of the portrait on the front of the bill and to the right of the Lincoln Memorial vignette on the back. The zeros in the \"05\"s form a \"[[EURion constellation]]\" to prevent photocopying of the bill. Photocopy machines detect the particular pattern of yellow circles and refuse to make a copy. Some machines make a record of the illegal photocopy attempt, which a repair technician may report to law enforcement.\n\nThe five dollar bill lacks the [[optically variable ink]] of higher denomination US bills.\n\n===Design features===\nThe new $5 bills remain the same size and use the same\u2014but enhanced\u2014portraits and historical images. The most noticeable difference is the light-purple coloring of the center of the bill, which blends into gray near the edges.\n\nSimilar to the recently redesigned $10, $20, $50, and $100 bills, the new $5 bill features an American symbol of freedom printed in the background: The [[Great Seal of the United States]], featuring an eagle and shield, is printed in purple to the right of the portrait and an arc of purple stars surround both it and the portrait.\n\nWhen the Lincoln Memorial was constructed the names of 48 states were engraved on it. The picture of the Lincoln Memorial on the $5 bill only contains the names of 26 states. These are the 26 states that can be seen on the front side of the Lincoln memorial which is what is pictured on the $5 bill.\n\nOn the back of the bill, a larger, purple numeral \"5\" appears in the lower right corner to help those with visual impairments to distinguish the denomination. This large \"5\" also includes the words \"USA FIVE\" in tiny white letters.\n\nThe oval borders around President Lincoln's portrait on the front, and the Lincoln Memorial vignette on the back have been removed. Both engravings have been enhanced.\n\n==Redesign==\nOn April 20, 2016, [[Secretary of the Treasury|Treasury Secretary]] [[Jacob Lew]] announced that the $5, $10, and $20 would all undergo redesign prior to 2020. The changes would add new features to combat counterfeiting and make them easier for blind citizens to distinguish. Lew said that while Lincoln would remain on the obverse, the reverse would be redesigned to depict various historical events that had occurred at the Lincoln Memorial. Among the planned designs are images from the [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] [[I Have a Dream]] speech and the 1939 concert by opera singer [[Marian Anderson]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2016/04/20/report-lew-considered-anthony-10-bill/83274530/|title=Anti-slavery activist Harriet Tubman to replace Jackson on $20 bill|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n==Large size note history==\n[[File:US-$5-LT-1862-Fr-61a.jpg|thumb|200px|left|1862 $5 Legal Tender note]]\n[[File:US-$5-LT-1880-Fr-72.jpg|thumb|200px|left|1880 $5 [[United States Note|Legal Tender]]]]\n[[File:US-$5-SC-1891-Fr.266.jpg|thumb|200px|right|1891 $5 Silver Certificate depicting [[:en: Ulysses Grant|Ulysses S.

The obverse featured vignettes of [[Christopher Columbus]] sighting land and Columbus with an Indian Princess; the reverse featured US gold coins.\n*1875: The series 1869 United States Note was revised. The green tinting that was present on the obverse was removed and the design on the reverse was completely changed.\n*1886: The first $5 [[Silver certificate (United States)|silver certificate]] was issued with a portrait of [[Ulysses Grant|Ulysses S. Grant]] on the obverse and five [[Morgan silver dollar]]s on the reverse.\n*1890: Five-dollar Treasury or \"Coin Notes\" were issued and given for government purchases of silver bullion from the silver mining industry. The reverse featured an ornate design that occupied almost the entire note.\n*1891: The reverse of the 1890 Treasury Note was redesigned because the treasury felt that it was too \"busy\" which would make it too easy to [[counterfeit]].\n*1891: The reverse of the 1886 Silver Certificate was revised; the 5 Morgan silver dollars were removed.\n*1896: The famous \"[[Educational Series]]\" Silver Certificate was issued. The entire obverse was covered with artwork representing [[electricity]] and the reverse featured portraits of [[Ulysses S. Grant|Ulysses Grant]] and [[Phillip Sheridan]].\n*1899: A new $5 silver certificate with a portrait of [[Running Antelope]] on the face was issued.\n*1914: The first $5 [[Federal Reserve Note]] was issued with a portrait of [[Abraham Lincoln|Lincoln]] on the obverse and vignettes of Columbus sighting land and the Pilgrims' landing on the reverse. The note initially had a red [[Seal of the United States Department of the Treasury|treasury seal]] and serial numbers; however, they were changed to blue.\n*1915: [[Federal reserve bank note|Federal Reserve Bank Notes]] (not to be confused with Federal Reserve Notes) were issued by 5 Federal Reserve Banks. The obverse was similar to the 1914 Federal Reserve Notes, except for large wording in the middle of the bill and a portrait with no border on the left side of the bill. Each note was an obligation of the issuing bank and could only be redeemed at the corresponding bank.\n*1918: The 1915 Federal Reserve Bank Note was re-issued under series 1918 by 11 Federal Reserve banks.\n*1923: The $5 silver certificate was redesigned; it was nicknamed a \"porthole\" note due to the circular wording of <small>THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA</small> around Lincoln's portrait. The reverse featured the [[Great Seal of the United States]].\n\n==Small size note history==\n''(6.14 \u00d7 2.61 in \u2245 156 \u00d7 66&nbsp;mm)''\n[[File:US-$5-LT-1928-Fr.1525.jpg|thumb|200px|left|The first small-size $5 United States Note printed (Smithsonian).]]\n[[File:US-$5-FRN-1934-A-Fr.2302.jpg|thumb|200px|right|[[Hawaii overprint note]].]]\n[[File:US-$5-SC-1953-Fr.1655.jpg|thumb|200px|left|The first 1953 $5 Silver Certificate printed (Smithsonian).]]\n\n*1929: Under the [[Series of 1928 (United States Currency)|Series of 1928]], all [[small-sized note]]s carried a standardized design. All $5 bills would feature a portrait of Lincoln, the same border design on the [[obverse]], and the Lincoln Memorial on the [[Obverse and reverse|reverse]]. The $5 bill was issued as a [[United States Note]] with a red seal and serial numbers and as a [[Federal Reserve Note]] with a green seal and serial numbers.\n*1933: As an emergency response to the [[Great Depression]], additional money was pumped into the American economy through Federal Reserve Bank Notes. This was the only small-sized $5 bill that had a different border design. The serial numbers and seal on it were brown.\n*1934: The redeemable in gold clause was removed from Federal Reserve Notes due to the U.S. withdrawing from the [[gold standard]].\n*1934: The first $5 [[Silver certificate (United States)|silver certificates]] were issued with a blue seal and serial numbers along with a blue numeral 5 on the left side of the obverse.\n*1942: Special [[World War II]] [[HAWAII Overprint Note|currency was issued.]] <small>HAWAII</small> was overprinted on the front and back of the $5 Federal Reserve Note; the serial numbers, and seal, were changed to brown from green. This was done so that the currency could be declared worthless if there was a [[Japanese people|Japanese]] invasion. A $5 silver certificate was printed with a yellow instead of blue treasury seal; these notes were for U.S. troops in North Africa. These notes, too, could be declared worthless if seized by the enemy.\n*1950: Many minor aspects on the obverse of the $5 Federal Reserve Note were changed. Most noticeably, the treasury seal, gray word <small>FIVE</small>, and the Federal Reserve Seal were made smaller; also, the Federal Reserve seal had spikes added around it, like the Treasury seal.\n*1953: New $5 United States Notes and Silver Certificates were issued with a gray numeral 5 on the left side of the bill and the gray word <small>FIVE</small> with a blue seal imprinted over it on the right and blue serial numbers.\n*1963: Both the $5 United States Note and Federal Reserve Note were revised with the motto <small>IN GOD WE TRUST</small> added to the reverse and <small>WILL PAY TO THE BEARER ON DEMAND</small> removed from the obverse. Also, the obligation on the Federal Reserve Note was shortened to its current wording, <small>THIS NOTE IS LEGAL TENDER FOR ALL DEBTS PUBLIC AND PRIVATE</small>. Also during this time, production of Silver Certificates end, including the $5.\n*1967: Production of the $5 United States Note ends.\n*1969: The $5 bill began using the new treasury seal with wording in [[English language|English]] instead of [[Latin]].\n*1992: The first notes at the Western Currency Facility in [[Fort Worth, Texas]] begin printing in July, during production of Series 1988A.\n*1994: The first new-age anti-counterfeiting measures were introduced with microscopic printing around Lincoln's portrait and a plastic security strip on the left side of the bill. Even though the series date was Series 1993, they weren't printed until November 1994.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uspapermoney.info/serials/f1993_q.html|title=USPaperMoney.Info: Series 1993 $5|website=www.uspapermoney.info}}</ref>\n*May 24, 2000: To combat evolving [[counterfeit]]ing, a new $5 note, the first complete redesign since 1929, was issued under series 1999 whose design was similar in style to the $100, $50, $20, and $10 bills that had all undergone previous design changes. The $5 bill, however, does not feature color-shifting ink like all the other denominations. The first bills were printed in December 1999.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uspapermoney.info/serials/f1999_q.html|title=USPaperMoney.Info: Series 1999 $5|website=www.uspapermoney.info}}</ref>\n*June 28, 2006: The BEP announced plans to redesign the $5 note, likely with similar features as newer $10, $20, and $50 notes.\n*September 20, 2007: The BEP revealed the redesigned $5 note to the public.\n*October 2007: The first redesigned $5 notes are printed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uspapermoney.info/serials/f2006qq.html|title=USPaperMoney.Info: Series 2006 $5|website=www.uspapermoney.info}}</ref>\n*March 13, 2008: The redesigned $5 note enters circulation.\n\n===Series dates===\n\n====Small size====\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

Two of the Directive's articles have drawn significant discussion. Draft Article 11 (Article 15 of the directive), known as the \"link tax\", gives newspapers more direct control and re-use of their product, which may impact some Internet services like [[news aggregator]]s. Draft Article 13 (Article 17 of the directive) tasks service providers that host [[user-generated content]] to employ \"effective and proportionate\" measures to prevent users from violating copyright. Tech companies expressed concern that this would necessitate the need for upload filters at their current scales. A broad concern with the Directive is on the use of [[fair dealing]] through the directive, and that it could quell freedom of speech.\n\n== History ==\n===Background===\nThe European Union's (EU) first attempt to unify copyrights in light of digital technologies was adopted in 2001 as the [[Information Society Directive|Information Society Directive 2001/29/EC]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-01-528_en.htm|title=Commission welcomes adoption of the Directive on copyright in the information society by the Council|author=[[European Commission]]|date=4 July 2018|access-date=4 July 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180705062644/http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-01-528_en.htm|archive-date=5 July 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> The Directive's major objectives were to harmonise EU legislation with international law (as set by the 1996 [[World Intellectual Property Organization]] treaties), to strengthen intellectual property protection, to reduce conflicts in copyright laws between member states, and to assure adequate remuneration to content producers.<ref name=\"CESP 2015\">{{cite report | url = https://www.ceps.eu/system/files/SR120_0.pdf | title = The Implementation, Application and Effects of the EU Directive on Copyright in the Information Society | author1 = Andrea Renda | author2 = Felice Simonelli | author3 = Giuseppe Mazziotti | author4 = Alberto Bolognini | author5 = Giacomo Luchetta | publisher = [[Centre for European Policy Studies]] | date = November 2015 | accessdate = 13 September 2018 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20180913223259/https://www.ceps.eu/system/files/SR120_0.pdf | archivedate = 13 September 2018 | url-status = live}}</ref> While some parts of the 2001 Directive were effective, other parts of the directive were not satisfactory for the current digital market long after its implementation.

Two of the Directive's articles have drawn significant discussion. Draft Article 11 (Article 15 of the directive), known as the \"link tax\", gives newspapers more direct control and re-use of their product, which may impact some Internet services like [[news aggregator]]s. Draft Article 13 (Article 17 of the directive) tasks service providers that host [[user-generated content]] to employ \"effective and proportionate\" measures to prevent users from violating copyright. Tech companies expressed concern that this would necessitate the need for upload filters at their current scales. A broad concern with the Directive is on the use of [[fair dealing]] through the directive, and that it could quell freedom of speech.\n\n== History ==\n===Background===\nThe European Union's (EU) first attempt to unify copyrights in light of digital technologies was adopted in 2001 as the [[Information Society Directive|Information Society Directive 2001/29/EC]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-01-528_en.htm|title=Commission welcomes adoption of the Directive on copyright in the information society by the Council|author=[[European Commission]]|date=4 July 2018|access-date=4 July 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180705062644/http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-01-528_en.htm|archive-date=5 July 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> The Directive's major objectives were to harmonise EU legislation with international law (as set by the 1996 [[World Intellectual Property Organization]] treaties), to strengthen intellectual property protection, to reduce conflicts in copyright laws between member states, and to assure adequate remuneration to content producers.<ref name=\"CESP 2015\">{{cite report | url = https://www.ceps.eu/system/files/SR120_0.pdf | title = The Implementation, Application and Effects of the EU Directive on Copyright in the Information Society | authors = Andrea Renda, Felice Simonelli, Giuseppe Mazziotti, Alberto Bolognini and Giacomo Luchetta | publisher = [[Centre for European Policy Studies]] | date = November 2015 | accessdate = 13 September 2018 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20180913223259/https://www.ceps.eu/system/files/SR120_0.pdf | archivedate = 13 September 2018 | url-status = live | df = dmy-all }}</ref> While some parts of the 2001 Directive were effective, other parts of the directive were not satisfactory for the current digital market long after its implementation.

Most states have not recognised them as being Russian territory.\n\nThe administrative division in Ukraine was [[Administrative divisions of the Ukrainian SSR|directly inherited]] (grandfathered) from the [[Republics of the Soviet Union|local republican]] administration of the [[Soviet Union]], the [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic]], and has not changed significantly since the middle of the 20th century. It is somewhat complex, as beside having several levels of a territorial subdivision it also has a classification for various [[Populated places in Ukraine|populated places]], particularly [[Cities of Ukraine|cities]].\n\n==Overview==\n{{confusing|date=December 2014}}\n{{refimprove section|date=December 2014}}\n{{See also|Local government in Ukraine}}\n[[File:Administrative divisions of Ukraine improved.jpg|thumb|400px|Simple flow chart of administrative divisions of Ukraine]]\n\nAccording to the Article 133 of [[Constitution of Ukraine]], \"the system of the administrative and territorial structure of Ukraine is composed of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea, oblasts, districts, cities, districts in city, settlements, and villages.\" Note, that although certain types of subdivision are not mentioned in Constitution of Ukraine (i.e. rural settlements), they are mentioned for regional composition. Also, for disambiguation regular raions (districts) are sometimes denoted as rural to distinguish them from raions in city.<ref name=regions/>\n\nUkraine's administrative divisions are divided as follows:\n*By geographical characteristics the units are divided on regions (such as autonomous republic, oblasts, districts, cities with special status) and places of settlement (cities, towns, villages).\n*By their status they can be administrative-territorial units (oblasts and districts), self-governed territorial units (cities, towns, villages). Also the autonomous republic has a unique status of territorial autonomy, while districts in cities combine both characteristics of administrative territorial as well as self-governed territorial units.\n*By position in the system of administrative division of Ukraine, the units divided into territorial units of ''prime level'' (cities w/o district division, districts in cities, towns, villages), of ''middle level'' (districts, cities with district division), and of ''higher level'' (autonomous republic, oblasts, cities with special status).\n*Administrative division has changed because some territories are not under the control of the government. For example, Sievierodonetsk has become the new central regional center.\n\nRegions, cities, districts are governed by a state administration, a chief of which is appointed by the president after a nomination by the [[Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine|cabinet of ministers]].<ref>[http://en.interfax.com.ua/news/general/382028.html Poroshenko to sign Saakashvili\u2019s resignation if Cabinet submits motion], [[Interfax-Ukraine]] (7 November 2016)</ref> Crimea has its own cabinet of ministers, however the state administration is represented by the office of the Presidential Representative of Ukraine. A basic and the lowest level of administrative division is a settlement that is governed by a local council (rada). Cities as a settlement always carry a special status within a region and have their own form of self-administration (municipality \u2013 ''vykonkom'') and some may consist of their own city's districts (raions). City municipalities are governed by a mayor and a city council (miskrada). Some smaller cities, towns, and rural localities may be under control of city municipalities based on larger cities. Towns as well as villages are not controlled by state administration and are self-governed by either a town council (selyshchna rada) or a village council (silrada) within the limits of the Constitution and the laws of Ukraine (article 140 of the Constitution of Ukraine). Village councils may carry a combined jurisdiction which may include several villages and hamlets (selyshche). Unlike villages, each town council always has a separate jurisdiction which may be part of bigger city's council. Hamlet (selyshche) is a non-governed rural locality and is governed by a village council of nearby village.\n\n===Table===\nUkraine is divided into 3 main administrative divisions: [[oblast]] (region), [[raion]] (district), and council (city, settlement, and village). Note, settlements such as cities do not necessary constitute the basic level of the Ukrainian administrative territorial system. For that purpose cities are categorized into own three categories that correspond to each level of subdivisions. Cities with special status and regional significance beside being divided into special districts in city may also include smaller cities (district significance), settlements, and/or villages. Please, note that the settlement's population size is not the only factor for its status. The final decision on status change is carried out by the [[Ukrainian parliament]].

Excluded in the administrative changes was [[Western Ukraine]], which at that time formed part of the [[Second Polish Republic]] and shared in the Polish form of administrative division based on [[Voivodeships of Poland|voivodeships]].\n\nIn the post-[[World War II]] period, the [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic]] consisted of [[Administrative divisions of the Ukrainian SSR|25 oblasts and two cities with special status]].\n\nAfter the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991, Crimea obtained the status of an autonomous republic with its own government instead of a regional state administration.\n\n==Regions==\n{{Ukraine Labelled Map|float=right}}\n\n===Autonomous republic===\n{{Main|Autonomous Republic of Crimea}}\n\nThe Autonomous Republic of Crimea, formerly the Crimean Oblast of the Ukrainian SSR, geographically encompasses the major portion of the Crimean peninsula in southern [[Ukraine]]. Its capital is [[Simferopol]]. The Autonomous Republic of Crimea is the only region within Ukraine that possesses its own constitution.\n\nOn March 16, 2014, after the occupation of Crimea by the Russian military, a referendum on joining the Russian Federation was conducted. A majority of votes supported the measure. On March 21, 2014, the Russian Duma voted to annex Crimea as a [[Republic of Crimea|subject]] into the Russian Federation. The Ukrainian government does not recognize the referendum or annexation of Crimea as legitimate. On March 27, the UN General Assembly passed [[United Nations General Assembly Resolution 68/262|Resolution 68/262]] by 100 to 11 votes, recognizing the referendum as invalid and denying any legal change in the status of Crimea and Sevastopol.\n\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\"\n|- style=\"background:#ddd; vertical-align:top;\"\n!

For the sake of brevity, urbanized settlements are sometimes classified as towns in the [[English language]].\n\nChanges to a settlement's status can be made only by the [[Verkhovna Rada]]. Please note that the size of a settlement does not ultimately define its status, although is a major factor. For example, the city of [[Prypiat (city)|Prypiat]] still retains its status, while having a population of zero, due to its infrastructure, including buildings, roads, and utility networks.\n\nThe typical Ukrainian ''misto'' ought to be considered a [[city]], not a [[town]] (compare to [[City status in the United Kingdom]]). However, the city's subordination to either an oblast or raion also should be taken into account, especially in the [[political]] sense. Some of urbanized settlements may be cities of raion subordination, although it could seem confusing, a type of settlement should be considered first as its status is given for administrative purposes.\n\n===Cities===\n{{see also|List of cities in Ukraine}}\n[[File:Kyiv province location map.svg|thumb|left|[[Kiev Oblast]] for instance, has several regional city municipalities such as [[Pereiaslav]], for example, that are under direct subordination to the regional authorities.

Blinnikov, [[Guilford Press]], 2010, {{ISBN|1606239201}} (page 151)</ref> Cities may carry various status. Some may be of national importance, others of [[city of regional significance (Ukraine)|regional (oblast) importance]], and the rest of district (raion) importance. For example, the cities of ''Kiev'' and of ''Sevastopol'' have special status of national significance and each is officially classified as a ''city with a special status'', which administratively is equivalent to an oblast. Mayors of those cities, in general, as are governors of oblasts, are appointed by the [[President of Ukraine]]. However, the status of the mayor of Kiev is somewhat more complex, and for further information see [[Legal status and local government of Kiev]]. The status of Sevastopol is also unique.\n\nAlmost every oblast has at least one city of regional subordination (importance), which is the administrative center (capital) of that oblast. However, some other big cities within the oblast may have such status as well. The cities of oblast subordination have the same importance of a raion, and often are the administrative centers of such. In addition to regular raions, several Ukrainian cities with national or oblast status are further divided into ''city raions'' which may include other cities, towns, and/or villages. In 2010, Ukraine had 23 such cities with their own city raions.\n\nMany '''raions''' also have city municipalities of its level of subordination (importance). Those are usually the administrative centers (capitals). Notice that not all raions have a city as their administrative center; however all the raion centers are at least urban-like (urbanized). All administrative centers have their own form of self-administration. The municipalities of a raion subordination may administer several adjacent local councils (municipalities), usually rural. If a raion has several cities of raion (district) level, they may share administrative power for the raion.\n\n===Other municipalities===\nIn addition to city municipalities, Ukraine has urban-like municipalities. The lowest form of self-administration are the rural municipalities and villages. A rural municipality may consist of a single village, usually big, or a combination of other rural villages or localities. Note that some villages also have some additional, very small settlements. Those settlements, together with the home village, combine a local (rural) municipality (silrada). For simplicity's sake, a silrada (rural municipality) is usually referred to as a village and is the lowest level of administrative division. The status of any settlement is granted by the [[Verkhovna Rada]].\n\n===Amalgamated hromadas (AHs)===\nIn his draft [[Ukraine's constitution|constitutional]] amendments of June 2014 [[Ukrainian President]] [[Petro Poroshenko]] proposed changing the administrative divisions of Ukraine, which should include regions, districts and \"hromadas\".<ref>[http://en.interfax.com.ua/news/general/211043.html Poroshenko suggests granting status of regions to Crimea, Kyiv, Sevastopol, creating new political subdivision of 'community'] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140701043549/http://en.interfax.com.ua/news/general/211043.html |date=2014-07-01 }}, [[Interfax-Ukraine]] (26 June 2014)</ref>\n\nOn February 5, 2015, the law \"On voluntary association of territorial communities\" was adopted creating ''Amalgamated hromadas (communities)'' meaning [[Settlement council (Ukraine)|settlement councils]], [[Rural council (Ukraine)|rural councils]] and a [[City of district significance (Ukraine)|city of district significance]] can create a new administrative unit.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://reformsguide.org.ua/reforms/decentralizationreform/|title=Decentralization|date=2017-02-10|website=The Reforms Guide|language=en-US|access-date=2018-12-28}}</ref> Any amalgamated hromada with a city as an administrative centre is an urban hromada, any amalgamated hromada with an urban-type settlement as an administrative centre is a settlement hromada, and any amalgamated hromada with a village as an administrative centre is a rural hromada.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://decentralization.gov.ua/en/glossary|title=Glossary|date=|website=Decentralization Reform|language=en-US|access-date=2020-01-18}}</ref> New local [[elections in Ukraine|elections]] in these united territorial communities were then held.<ref>[http://en.interfax.com.ua/news/general/472770.html Batkivschyna party says it gets most votes at local elections], [[Interfax Ukraine]] (25 December 2017)<br>[https://www.unian.info/politics/2316594-police-investigate-voter-bribing-cases-as-local-elections-held-in-51-territorial-communities.html Police investigate voter bribing cases as local elections held in 51 territorial communities], [[UNIAN]] (25 December 2017)</ref> 226 will be holding elections in 2018 and 2019.<ref>[http://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/ukrainealert/elections-are-around-the-corner-and-ukraine-s-political-parties-are-not-ready-2 Elections Are Around the Corner, and Ukraine\u2019s Political Parties Are Not Ready], [[Atlantic Council]] (6 December 2017)</ref> The first 252 were held in 2017.<ref>[https://www.oporaua.org/en/elections/45055-interim-report-on-observation-results-of-the-first-local-elections-in-united-territorial-communities-on-29-october-2017-19102017-26102017 INTERIM REPORT ON OBSERVATION RESULTS OF THE FIRST LOCAL ELECTIONS IN UNITED TERRITORIAL COMMUNITIES ON 29 October 2017 (19.10.2017 26.10.2017)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181228223135/https://www.oporaua.org/en/elections/45055-interim-report-on-observation-results-of-the-first-local-elections-in-united-territorial-communities-on-29-october-2017-19102017-26102017 |date=28 December 2018 }}, [[PORA#OPORA|OPORA]] (31 October 2017)<br>[https://www.oporaua.org/en/elections/45165-ukraine-holds-elections-in-51-utcs-today Ukraine holds elections in 51 UTCs today] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171226020921/https://www.oporaua.org/en/elections/45165-ukraine-holds-elections-in-51-utcs-today |date=2017-12-26 }}, [[PORA#OPORA|OPORA]] (24 December 2017)</ref> \n\nThe Law \"On Local Self-Government in Ukraine\" stipulates that local budgets should have enough money to be administered by local self-government bodies.<ref name=\"Espresogr\"/> Because many of the small rural councils and cities of district significance could never hope to do this the new administrative unit ''Amalgamated hromada'' ([https://uk.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%9E%D0%B1%27%D1%94%D0%B4%D0%BD%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B0_%D1%82%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%B8%D1%82%D0%BE%D1%80%D1%96%D0%B0%D0%BB%D1%8C%D0%BD%D0%B0_%D0%B3%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%BC%D0%B0%D0%B4%D0%B0]{{lang-uk|\u041e\u0431'\u0454\u0434\u043d\u0430\u043d\u0430 \u0442\u0435\u0440\u0438\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0456\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0430 \u0433\u0440\u043e\u043c\u0430\u0434\u0430}}, ''Obyednana terytorial\u02b9na hromada'') was created.<ref name=\"Espresogr\">{{in lang|uk}} [https://espreso.tv/article/2017/10/30/vybory_v_obyednanykh_terytorialnykh_gromadakh_scho_ce_i_dlya_chogo_potribne Elections in the united territorial communities.

Also, for disambiguation regular raions (districts) are sometimes denoted as rural to distinguish them from raions in city.<ref name=regions/>\n\nUkraine's administrative divisions are divided as follows:\n*By geographical characteristics the units are divided on regions (such as autonomous republic, oblasts, districts, cities with special status) and places of settlement (cities, towns, villages).\n*By their status they can be administrative-territorial units (oblasts and districts), self-governed territorial units (cities, towns, villages). Also the autonomous republic has a unique status of territorial autonomy, while districts in cities combine both characteristics of administrative territorial as well as self-governed territorial units.\n*By position in the system of administrative division of Ukraine, the units divided into territorial units of ''prime level'' (cities w/o district division, districts in cities, towns, villages), of ''middle level'' (districts, cities with district division), and of ''higher level'' (autonomous republic, oblasts, cities with special status).\n*Administrative division has changed because some territories are not under the control of the government. For example, Sievierodonetsk has become the new central regional center.\n\nRegions, cities, districts are governed by a state administration, a chief of which is appointed by the president after a nomination by the [[Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine|cabinet of ministers]].<ref>[http://en.interfax.com.ua/news/general/382028.html Poroshenko to sign Saakashvili\u2019s resignation if Cabinet submits motion], [[Interfax-Ukraine]] (7 November 2016)</ref> Crimea has its own cabinet of ministers, however the state administration is represented by the office of the Presidential Representative of Ukraine. A basic and the lowest level of administrative division is a settlement that is governed by a local council (rada). Cities as a settlement always carry a special status within a region and have their own form of self-administration (municipality \u2013 ''vykonkom'') and some may consist of their own city's districts (raions). City municipalities are governed by a mayor and a city council (miskrada). Some smaller cities, towns, and rural localities may be under control of city municipalities based on larger cities. Towns as well as villages are not controlled by state administration and are self-governed by either a town council (selyshchna rada) or a village council (silrada) within the limits of the Constitution and the laws of Ukraine (article 140 of the Constitution of Ukraine). Village councils may carry a combined jurisdiction which may include several villages and hamlets (selyshche). Unlike villages, each town council always has a separate jurisdiction which may be part of bigger city's council. Hamlet (selyshche) is a non-governed rural locality and is governed by a village council of nearby village.\n\n===Table===\nUkraine is divided into 3 main administrative divisions: [[oblast]] (region), [[raion]] (district), and council (city, settlement, and village). Note, settlements such as cities do not necessary constitute the basic level of the Ukrainian administrative territorial system. For that purpose cities are categorized into own three categories that correspond to each level of subdivisions. Cities with special status and regional significance beside being divided into special districts in city may also include smaller cities (district significance), settlements, and/or villages. Please, note that the settlement's population size is not the only factor for its status. The final decision on status change is carried out by the [[Ukrainian parliament]].

The Ukrainian government does not recognize the referendum or annexation of Crimea as legitimate.

Urban populated areas (\u043c\u0456\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u043d\u0430\u0441\u0435\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u043f\u0443\u043d\u043a\u0442) can be either a city (\u043c\u0456\u0441\u0442o) or an [[urban-type settlement]] (\u0441\u0435\u043b\u0438\u0449\u0435 \u043c\u0456\u0441\u044c\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0442\u0438\u043f\u0443). For the sake of brevity, urbanized settlements are sometimes classified as towns in the [[English language]].\n\nChanges to a settlement's status can be made only by the [[Verkhovna Rada]]. Please note that the size of a settlement does not ultimately define its status, although is a major factor. For example, the city of [[Prypiat (city)|Prypiat]] still retains its status, while having a population of zero, due to its infrastructure, including buildings, roads, and utility networks.\n\nThe typical Ukrainian ''misto'' ought to be considered a [[city]], not a [[town]] (compare to [[City status in the United Kingdom]]). However, the city's subordination to either an oblast or raion also should be taken into account, especially in the [[political]] sense. Some of urbanized settlements may be cities of raion subordination, although it could seem confusing, a type of settlement should be considered first as its status is given for administrative purposes.\n\n===Cities===\n{{see also|List of cities in Ukraine}}\n[[File:Kyiv province location map.svg|thumb|left|[[Kiev Oblast]] for instance, has several regional city municipalities such as [[Pereiaslav]], for example, that are under direct subordination to the regional authorities.

Blinnikov, [[Guilford Press]], 2010, {{ISBN|1606239201}} (page 151)</ref> Cities may carry various status. Some may be of national importance, others of [[city of regional significance (Ukraine)|regional (oblast) importance]], and the rest of district (raion) importance. For example, the cities of ''Kiev'' and of ''Sevastopol'' have special status of national significance and each is officially classified as a ''city with a special status'', which administratively is equivalent to an oblast. Mayors of those cities, in general, as are governors of oblasts, are appointed by the [[President of Ukraine]]. However, the status of the mayor of Kiev is somewhat more complex, and for further information see [[Legal status and local government of Kiev]]. The status of Sevastopol is also unique.\n\nAlmost every oblast has at least one city of regional subordination (importance), which is the administrative center (capital) of that oblast. However, some other big cities within the oblast may have such status as well. The cities of oblast subordination have the same importance of a raion, and often are the administrative centers of such. In addition to regular raions, several Ukrainian cities with national or oblast status are further divided into ''city raions'' which may include other cities, towns, and/or villages. In 2010, Ukraine had 23 such cities with their own city raions.\n\nMany '''raions''' also have city municipalities of its level of subordination (importance). Those are usually the administrative centers (capitals). Notice that not all raions have a city as their administrative center; however all the raion centers are at least urban-like (urbanized). All administrative centers have their own form of self-administration. The municipalities of a raion subordination may administer several adjacent local councils (municipalities), usually rural. If a raion has several cities of raion (district) level, they may share administrative power for the raion.\n\n===Other municipalities===\nIn addition to city municipalities, Ukraine has urban-like municipalities. The lowest form of self-administration are the rural municipalities and villages. A rural municipality may consist of a single village, usually big, or a combination of other rural villages or localities. Note that some villages also have some additional, very small settlements. Those settlements, together with the home village, combine a local (rural) municipality (silrada). For simplicity's sake, a silrada (rural municipality) is usually referred to as a village and is the lowest level of administrative division. The status of any settlement is granted by the [[Verkhovna Rada]].\n\n===Amalgamated hromadas (AHs)===\nIn his draft [[Ukraine's constitution|constitutional]] amendments of June 2014 [[Ukrainian President]] [[Petro Poroshenko]] proposed changing the administrative divisions of Ukraine, which should include regions, districts and \"hromadas\".<ref>[http://en.interfax.com.ua/news/general/211043.html Poroshenko suggests granting status of regions to Crimea, Kyiv, Sevastopol, creating new political subdivision of 'community'] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140701043549/http://en.interfax.com.ua/news/general/211043.html |date=2014-07-01 }}, [[Interfax-Ukraine]] (26 June 2014)</ref>\n\nOn February 5, 2015, the law \"On voluntary association of territorial communities\" was adopted creating ''Amalgamated hromadas (communities)'' meaning [[Settlement council (Ukraine)|settlement councils]], [[Rural council (Ukraine)|rural councils]] and a [[City of district significance (Ukraine)|city of district significance]] can create a new administrative unit.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://reformsguide.org.ua/reforms/decentralizationreform/|title=Decentralization|date=2017-02-10|website=The Reforms Guide|language=en-US|access-date=2018-12-28}}</ref> Any amalgamated hromada with a city as an administrative centre is an urban hromada, any amalgamated hromada with an urban-type settlement as an administrative centre is a settlement hromada, and any amalgamated hromada with a village as an administrative centre is a rural hromada.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://decentralization.gov.ua/en/glossary|title=Glossary|date=|website=Decentralization Reform|language=en-US|access-date=2020-01-18}}</ref> New local [[elections in Ukraine|elections]] in these united territorial communities were then held.<ref>[http://en.interfax.com.ua/news/general/472770.html Batkivschyna party says it gets most votes at local elections], [[Interfax Ukraine]] (25 December 2017)<br>[https://www.unian.info/politics/2316594-police-investigate-voter-bribing-cases-as-local-elections-held-in-51-territorial-communities.html Police investigate voter bribing cases as local elections held in 51 territorial communities], [[UNIAN]] (25 December 2017)</ref> 226 will be holding elections in 2018 and 2019.<ref>[http://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/ukrainealert/elections-are-around-the-corner-and-ukraine-s-political-parties-are-not-ready-2 Elections Are Around the Corner, and Ukraine\u2019s Political Parties Are Not Ready], [[Atlantic Council]] (6 December 2017)</ref> The first 252 were held in 2017.<ref>[https://www.oporaua.org/en/elections/45055-interim-report-on-observation-results-of-the-first-local-elections-in-united-territorial-communities-on-29-october-2017-19102017-26102017 INTERIM REPORT ON OBSERVATION RESULTS OF THE FIRST LOCAL ELECTIONS IN UNITED TERRITORIAL COMMUNITIES ON 29 October 2017 (19.10.2017 26.10.2017)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181228223135/https://www.oporaua.org/en/elections/45055-interim-report-on-observation-results-of-the-first-local-elections-in-united-territorial-communities-on-29-october-2017-19102017-26102017 |date=28 December 2018 }}, [[PORA#OPORA|OPORA]] (31 October 2017)<br>[https://www.oporaua.org/en/elections/45165-ukraine-holds-elections-in-51-utcs-today Ukraine holds elections in 51 UTCs today] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171226020921/https://www.oporaua.org/en/elections/45165-ukraine-holds-elections-in-51-utcs-today |date=2017-12-26 }}, [[PORA#OPORA|OPORA]] (24 December 2017)</ref> \n\nThe Law \"On Local Self-Government in Ukraine\" stipulates that local budgets should have enough money to be administered by local self-government bodies.<ref name=\"Espresogr\"/> Because many of the small rural councils and cities of district significance could never hope to do this the new administrative unit ''Amalgamated hromada'' ([https://uk.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%9E%D0%B1%27%D1%94%D0%B4%D0%BD%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B0_%D1%82%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%B8%D1%82%D0%BE%D1%80%D1%96%D0%B0%D0%BB%D1%8C%D0%BD%D0%B0_%D0%B3%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%BC%D0%B0%D0%B4%D0%B0]{{lang-uk|\u041e\u0431'\u0454\u0434\u043d\u0430\u043d\u0430 \u0442\u0435\u0440\u0438\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0456\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0430 \u0433\u0440\u043e\u043c\u0430\u0434\u0430}}, ''Obyednana terytorial\u02b9na hromada'') was created.<ref name=\"Espresogr\">{{in lang|uk}} [https://espreso.tv/article/2017/10/30/vybory_v_obyednanykh_terytorialnykh_gromadakh_scho_ce_i_dlya_chogo_potribne Elections in the united territorial communities.

Iori is the heir of the Yagami clan, who use [[pyrokinesis|pyrokinetic]] powers and sealed the [[Orochi (King of Fighters)|Orochi]] devil along with the Kusanagi and Yata clans.

The designers ended up liking him so much they are careful of the character's [[Characterisation|development]] as the series expands. \nAs a result, Iori sometimes helps Kyo to have the opportunity to fight him. Finding his design appealing, new outfits presented the SNK staff with difficulties as they devised new appearances for the character that would retain his popularity.\n\nVideo game journalists have praised Iori Yagami as one of the most powerful characters in the series. Reviewers have also cited Iori as one of the best characters from the games, labeling him as a veteran character and praising his appearance as one of SNK's best creations. \"Miss X\", Iori's crossdressing form from ''[[SNK Gals' Fighters]]'' and the additional female one of ''[[SNK Heroines: Tag Team Frenzy]]'', also received attention for its humor.

Iori is the heir of the Yagami clan, who use [[pyrokinesis|pyrokinetic]] powers and sealed the [[Orochi (King of Fighters)|Orochi]] devil along with the Kusanagi and Yata clans.

The designers ended up liking him so much they are careful of the character's [[Characterisation|development]] as the series expands. \nAs a result, Iori sometimes helps Kyo to have the opportunity to fight him. Finding his design appealing, new outfits presented the SNK staff with difficulties as they devised new appearances for the character that would retain his popularity.\n\nVideo game journalists have praised Iori Yagami as one of the most powerful characters in the series. Reviewers have also cited Iori as one of the best characters from the games, labeling him as a veteran character and praising his appearance as one of SNK's best creations. \"Miss X\", Iori's crossdressing form from ''[[SNK Gals' Fighters]]'' and the additional female one of ''[[SNK Heroines: Tag Team Frenzy]]'', also received attention for its humor.

Deputy Members of Youth Parliament are also elected, although not every MYP has a deputy.<ref name=\"About - UK Youth Parliament\"/> Deputies work with and support their Member of Youth Parliament locally and regionally, but are not entitled to attend the Annual Sitting or other national events \u2013 unless their MYP is unable to.\n\nThere are 369 constituencies that MYPs can sit in.\n\n=== Elections ===\nThe UK Youth Parliament elections are held every one or two years (depending on the local authority), with all young people between the ages of 11\u201318 being entitled to vote or stand. In England, over 90 percent of the [[local education authority|local education authorities]] hold UKYP elections.\n\nYoung people elect their local area's MYPs, who provide a voice for the young people in their area. The number of MYP positions is proportionate to the population of young people in the authority.\n\nOver one million votes were cast in the elections between 2006 and 2009. In 2008, 565,802 young people voted, with 1,625 standing as candidates from across [[England]], [[Wales]], and [[Northern Ireland]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ukyouthparliament.org.uk/ukypdebatable/issue7/elections.pdf |title=Debatable Issue 7 |accessdate=2009-03-16 |publisher=UK Youth Parliament |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090108053124/http://www.ukyouthparliament.org.uk/ukypdebatable/Issue7/elections.pdf |archivedate=2009-01-08 }}</ref>\n\nOutside of England, partner organisations undertake the elections; in [[Scotland]], elections are held every two years for young people to elect their local Member of the Scottish Youth Parliament (MSYP). The [[Scottish Youth Parliament]] then internally appoints sixteen of their members to represent the nation as their Members of the UK Youth Parliament which means that Scottish MYPs hold a [[dual mandate]] as both a MYP and a MSYP. In Northern Ireland a similar system is used by the [[Northern Ireland Youth Forum]] and was used in Wales until 2014 by the [[Children and Young People's Assembly for Wales]].

The session was recorded in [[Hansard]], and the morning debates were broadcast on BBC Parliament the same day. The final two debates were televised later in the week.\n\nThe debates were chaired by [[John Bercow]], Speaker of the House of Commons, who closed the event with a dramatic speech to MYPs in which he described the [[British National Party]] as \"a poison which we could well do without\".<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/8333161.stm|title=Speaker attacks \"poison\" of BNP |date=30 October 2009|publisher=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=28 February 2010}}</ref> The Speaker is usually expected to remain impartial, so as not to compromise his authority, but in this case was able to express personal opinion because the ornamental mace that indicates Parliament is sitting was not in place.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/bercow-breaks-convention-to-attack-bnp-1812274.html|title=Bercow breaks convention to attack BNP|last=Savage|first=Michael|date=31 October 2009|work=[[The Independent]]|accessdate=28 February 2010}}</ref>\n\n==== 2010 ====\nIn 2010 a debate was held to disuses the possibility of the youth parliament returning for a second sitting.  This resulted in the decision to allow their return not only for that year, but every year for the remainder of the sitting of the current parliament.\n\nUKYP's 2010 Debate took place on 29 October, again chaired by [[John Bercow]], Speaker of the House of Commons with the topics chosen for debate being selected from an Online Ballot. It was broadcast live on Parliament's Website & BBC Parliament.\n\nAs reported on the UK Youth Parliament's official website, the results of the five issues that were debated are listed as follows:\n*Should sex and relationships education be compulsory from primary school onwards? FOR-211 and AGAINST-104 \n*Should university tuition fees rise? FOR-57 and AGAINST-267\n*Should the school leaving age be raised to 18 immediately in order to lower youth unemployment? FOR-56 and AGAINST-271 \n*Should we withdraw all British troops from Afghanistan by 2012? FOR-137 and AGAINST-179 \n*Should reduced transport fares for young people be protected from spending cuts? FOR-239 and AGAINST-80\n\nTherefore, \"Should reduced transport fares for young people be protected from spending cuts?\" became UKYP's National Campaign for 2011.\n\n==== 2011 ====\nIn 2011, the Members of Youth Parliament again debated in the House of Commons on 4 November. This time five topics were chosen by over 65,000 young people. The event was chaired by [[John Bercow]], Speaker of the House of Commons, after his persistence in supporting the youth parliament. The sitting was broadcast on [[BBC Parliament]] but this time live from 11:00am \u2013 4:00pm.\n\nFollowing the debates, the motion entitled 'Make public transport cheaper, better and accessible for all' was chosen as UKYP's National Campaign for 2012.\n\n==== 2012 ====\nIn 2012 and for the fourth time, Members of UKYP gathered in the House of Commons on 23 November, with the topics again being chosen through the Make Your Ballot. There was a large increase in turnout. From 65,000 in 2011, over 253,000 took part to choose the five topics that were debated. Again it was chaired by John Bercow, Speaker of the House of Commons, and was broadcast live via Parliament's Website & BBC Parliament from 11:00-16:00. \u2018A Curriculum To Prepare Us For Life\u2019 received 154 votes from the 295 cast and therefore became UKYP's 2013 National Campaign.\n\n==== 2013 ====\nIn 2013, Members of UKYP came together for the fifth year in a row to debate on the green benches on 15 November, the top five issues chosen through the Make Your Mark Ballot. A record 478,386 young people took part, an increase of over 225,000 from 2012. In a difference to choosing campaigns, Members of UKYP chose two campaigns for 2014; one UK-wide issue and one devolved issue (England only). It was chaired like the other debates by John Bercow, Speaker of the House of Commons, and broadcast live on Parliament's Website & BBC Parliament from 11:00-16:00.\n\nFollowing the debates in which [[Nick Hurd]] MP, then Minister for Civil Society stated that 'Old shouldn't dominate politics', \u2018Votes For 16 and 17 Year Olds In All Public Elections\u2019 was prioritised as the UK Priority Campaign for 2014, whilst \u2018A Curriculum To Prepare Us For Life\u2019 was voted as the priority campaign for England.\n\n==== 2014 ====\nThe 2014 UKYP sitting in the House of Commons took place on 14 November with the biggest media attention in the sitting's six-year history. Once more chaired by John Bercow, Speaker of the House of Commons, the topics were chosen through 876,488 ballots, around 14.8% of the UK's 11-18-year-old population. The proceedings were broadcast on Parliament's website as tradition but were only shown through the [[BBC]] via their Democracy Live Site; the reason for this was due to the [[Scottish National Party]]'s Annual Autumn Conference commencing that day. However, it was broadcast between 20:20-00:00 on [[BBC Parliament]] that day to give chance for viewers to watch if they couldn't watch online. Also, for the first time the event was covered by [[Sky News]] on the world's biggest video sharing site, [[YouTube]] through their 'Stand Up Be Counted' campaign, which was launched in the summer of 2014.\n\nBefore the debates on campaigns occurred, MYPs held a special commemoration marking the 100th anniversary of the start of [[World War I]]. Thirteen MYPs were selected by a video application process to speak from the Dispatch Boxes on how the war affected either their families of region followed by one minute of silence. This was agreed on at UKYP's Annual Sitting in Lancaster that summer.\n\nOnce the debates and speeches from [[Leader of the House of Commons]], [[William Hague]], [[Natascha Engel]] MP and [[Tessa Munt]] MP had taken place, the following information shows the results of the two votes; one for the UK-wide 2015 issue and like 2013's debate, one devolved issue for England:\n\nUK-wide issue: \n*Everyone should be paid at least the Living Wage: 156 \n*Votes for 16- and 17-year-olds in all public elections: 117\n\nEngland-wide issue:\n*Mental health services should be improved with our help: 176\n*Better work experience and careers advice: 78\n*Bring back exam resits in English and Maths: 32\n\nTherefore, 'Everyone should be paid at least the Living Wage' was chosen as UKYP's UK Campaign for 2015 whiles 'Mental Health services should be improved by our help' became UKYP's 2015 Campaign for England.\n\n==== 2015 ====\n\nThe 2015 sitting took place on 13 November, following the counting of 969,992 Make Your Mark Ballots that were cast through the ballot.\n\nAfter the debates occurred, a special 30 minute debate entitled \"My Magna Carta\" was held, 800 years after the historic document was first signed.\n\nThe information below states the results of the ballots, to choose what of the debated topics would become the two priority campaigns for 2016:\n\nUK Wide:\n\n\u2022\tWorking together to combat racism and religious discrimination: 155\n\n\u2022\tEveryone should be paid at least the Living Wage: 117\n\nTackling Racism and Religious Discrimination therefore became the UK Wide campaign for 2016, and became the inquiry subject for the year's Youth Select Committee.\n\nDevolved:\n\n\u2022\tMental health services should be improved with our help: 176\n\n\u2022\tA curriculum to prepare us for life: 110\n\n\u2022\tMake public transport cheaper, better and accessible for all: 33\n\nThe existing Mental Health campaign was therefore re-selected as the devolved campaign for 2016.\n\n==== 2019 Sitting - amongst the General Election campaign ====\n\nDespite the calling of the [[2019 United Kingdom general election]], the sitting still went ahead and took place on November 8th 2019. The debates were chaired for the first time by both the new Speaker [[Lindsay Hoyle | Sir Lindsay Hoyle]] and fellow speakership candidate and current 1st Deputy Speaker [[Eleanor Laing | Dame Eleanor Laing]]. \n\nAs has been for each sitting, the Make Your Mark ballot determined the topics and overall saw just over 840,000 young people take part across the United Kingdom in 2019, with the motion on Protecting the Environment becoming the parliament's UK wise campaign for 2020 and Ending Knife Crime being chosen by MYP's as the devolved campaign topic.\n\nThe full results were as follows:\n\n'''UK Wide Campaign Topic'''\n\nProtecting the Climate - 179\n\nTackling Hate Crime - 68\n\n'''Devolved Campaign Topic'''\n\nMental Health - 69\n\nCurriculum to Prepare us for Life - 86\n\nPut an End to Knife Crime - 87\n\nFor the first time, the UK wide campaign topic will be launched as a Parliamentary E-Petition of which will be debated in the Commons chamber, if 100,000 members of the public sign it. The petition will be launched in early 2020.\n\nDue to dissolution of Parliament and it having taken place on November 6th 2019 (being prior to November 8th's proceedings), full broadcasting of the debates along with the publication of media reports, under election regulations were not published until 16th December 2019 - the week following the election. Full proceedings were made available on Parliament's YouTube channel that morning.\n\n==== Paul Boskett Memorial Trophy ====\n\nIn 2014 the introduction of the Paul Boskett Debate Lead Trophy was introduced. Every region elects someone to represent them and speak at the Dispatch Box and the strongest speaker is now awarded; the name comes from the late Paul Boskett MBE, who died in 2014 aged 59; he worked and was a lead figure within the [[British Youth Council]]. Paul is cited as a major inspiration for many young people and seen as a key champion of youth voice. The first Debate Lead Champion was Ife Grillo who sat as a Vice Chair to the British Youth Council between 2015-2017 and at the time of the Commons debate on 14 November 2014, represented the London Borough of Hackney.\n\n== Regional ==\nMembers of Youth Parliament in England are split into nine geographical regions, which meet and work together regularly: [[London]], [[East Midlands]], [[West Midlands (region)|West Midlands]], [[South West England|South West]], [[South East England|South East]], [[North West England|North West]], [[North East England|North East]], [[Yorkshire and the Humber]], [[East of England]].\n\nRegional meetings known as conventions take place three times a year (June, October and December) and last around a day. Members share news, issues and resources, in addition to taking part in training to help them in their role, relevant Government Consultations and within the October Convention, Elections occur to decide regional representatives to be a Debate Lead for UKYP's House of Commons Debate and the UKYP Steering Group for the following year (1 February to 31 January).\n\n== Campaigns ==\nThe UK Youth Parliament launched the \"Make Your Mark\" ballot in 2011. The purpose of the ballot to get young people from across the UK to determine which five topics the UK Youth Parliament would debate within the House of Commons. Over 65,000 young people completed the ballot after several months of campaigning.\n\nThe first five issues debated in the House of Commons chamber through 'Make Your Mark' were:\n# \"Make public transport cheaper, better and accessible for all\"\n# \"No to tuition fees, yes to graduate tax\"\n# \"Zero tolerance towards bullying in schools\"\n# \"End child poverty\"\n# \"A Greener future for Britain\"\n\nOn 4 November 2011, Members of Youth Parliament came from across the UK to debate and vote at House of Commons the most important issue to campaign on in 2012. The winning campaign topic was \"Make public transport cheaper, better and accessible for all\".\n\n2012's sitting chose \u2018A Curriculum To Prepare Us For Life\u2019 as the 2013 National Campaign. Over 253,000 young people took part.\n\nIn 2013, \u2018Votes For 16 and 17 Year Old's In All Public Elections\u2019 was prioritised as the UK Priority Campaign for 2014, whilst \u2018A Curriculum To Prepare Us For Life\u2019 was voted as the priority campaign for England. A new record of 478,386 young people cast a vote.\n\nIn 2014  876,488 young people helped to choose the House of Commons topics; over 14.8% of the UK's 11-18 year old population. 'Everyone should be paid at least the Living Wage' was chosen as UKYP's UK Campaign for 2015 with a National Campaign Day occurring on 24 January 2015. Also 'Mental Health services should be improved by our help' became UKYP's 2015 Campaign for England.\n\n2015 recorded 969,992 votes and saw that year's Commons Debate select Mental Health chosen as the England Campaign issue and Tackling Racism & Discrimination as the UK priority topic to campaign on.\n\n2016 saw another increase in MYM's total, with 978,216 having there say and as a result of that year's debates on the famous Green Benches, saw Votes at 16 be selected as the England campaign issue and a Curriculum for Life for the 2nd time be the national priority campaign topic.\n\nIn 2017, the Make Your Mark for the first time in the ballot's history fell, to 954,766 - of which however was widely still seen as an impressive total considering the scale of Youth Provision cuts since 2010. Both issues chosen in 2016, of a Curriculum for Life and Votes at 16 were once again selected by MYP's to be the priority campaign topics, however with them being switched in relation to the campaign area, meaning Votes at 16 took national precedent and a Curriculum for Life reverted to England only focus.\n\n2018's Ballot has written history and seen a initial total of 1,022,286 votes be declared, marking the first time Make Your Mark has exceeded 7 figures; with an increased and revised 2nd total to be announced on 24 October 2018, along with the Commons Debate topics for this year's proceedings - to be held on 9 November 2018.\n\n== Organisation ==\n\n=== Governance ===\n\n==== Steering Group ====\nDecisions regarding the development and progression of the organisation is undertaken by the Steering Group, made up of one MYP elected from each region and nation (known as \"SGs\"), for a 12-month term from 1 February to 31 January the following year. Their main focus is \"key decisions relating to the membership and the programme of work, within the given strategic boundaries\".<ref name=\"Accounts2008\">{{cite web |url=http://www.charity-commission.gov.uk/registeredcharities/ScannedAccounts/Ends16%5C0001084716_ac_20080331_e_c.pdf|title=Democracy for Young People Accounts 31 Mar 2008|publisher=[[Charity Commission]]|pages=4|accessdate=2009-11-03}}{{dead link|date=October 2017|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}} </ref>\n\nThey meet a minimum of four times a year to represent their regions nationally, coordinate campaign efforts and organise events such as the Annual Conference. Reports are taken back to MYPs at their regional conventions & other meetings.\n\nThe name of the group was changed from Procedures Group to Steering Group in November 2019 in order to reflect the groups varied responsibilities better.\n\n==== Management and support ====\n \nThe [[British Youth Council]] manages the UK Youth Parliament.

In England, over 90 percent of the [[local education authority|local education authorities]] hold UKYP elections.\n\nYoung people elect their local area's MYPs, who provide a voice for the young people in their area. The number of MYP positions is proportionate to the population of young people in the authority.\n\nOver one million votes were cast in the elections between 2006 and 2009. In 2008, 565,802 young people voted, with 1,625 standing as candidates from across [[England]], [[Wales]], and [[Northern Ireland]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ukyouthparliament.org.uk/ukypdebatable/issue7/elections.pdf |title=Debatable Issue 7 |accessdate=2009-03-16 |publisher=UK Youth Parliament |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090108053124/http://www.ukyouthparliament.org.uk/ukypdebatable/Issue7/elections.pdf |archivedate=2009-01-08 }}</ref>\n\nOutside of England, partner organisations undertake the elections; in [[Scotland]], elections are held every two years for young people to elect their local Member of the Scottish Youth Parliament (MSYP). The [[Scottish Youth Parliament]] then internally appoints sixteen of their members to represent the nation as their Members of the UK Youth Parliament which means that Scottish MYPs hold a [[dual mandate]] as both a MYP and a MSYP. In Northern Ireland a similar system is used by the [[Northern Ireland Youth Forum]] and was used in Wales until 2014 by the [[Children and Young People's Assembly for Wales]].

This time five topics were chosen by over 65,000 young people. The event was chaired by [[John Bercow]], Speaker of the House of Commons, after his persistence in supporting the youth parliament. The sitting was broadcast on [[BBC Parliament]] but this time live from 11:00am \u2013 4:00pm.\n\nFollowing the debates, the motion entitled 'Make public transport cheaper, better and accessible for all' was chosen as UKYP's National Campaign for 2012.\n\n==== 2012 ====\nIn 2012 and for the fourth time, Members of UKYP gathered in the House of Commons on 23 November, with the topics again being chosen through the Make Your Ballot. There was a large increase in turnout. From 65,000 in 2011, over 253,000 took part to choose the five topics that were debated. Again it was chaired by John Bercow, Speaker of the House of Commons, and was broadcast live via Parliament's Website & BBC Parliament from 11:00-16:00. \u2018A Curriculum To Prepare Us For Life\u2019 received 154 votes from the 295 cast and therefore became UKYP's 2013 National Campaign.\n\n==== 2013 ====\nIn 2013, Members of UKYP came together for the fifth year in a row to debate on the green benches on 15 November, the top five issues chosen through the Make Your Mark Ballot. A record 478,386 young people took part, an increase of over 225,000 from 2012. In a difference to choosing campaigns, Members of UKYP chose two campaigns for 2014; one UK-wide issue and one devolved issue (England only). It was chaired like the other debates by John Bercow, Speaker of the House of Commons, and broadcast live on Parliament's Website & BBC Parliament from 11:00-16:00.\n\nFollowing the debates in which [[Nick Hurd]] MP, then Minister for Civil Society stated that 'Old shouldn't dominate politics', \u2018Votes For 16 and 17 Year Olds In All Public Elections\u2019 was prioritised as the UK Priority Campaign for 2014, whilst \u2018A Curriculum To Prepare Us For Life\u2019 was voted as the priority campaign for England.\n\n==== 2014 ====\nThe 2014 UKYP sitting in the House of Commons took place on 14 November with the biggest media attention in the sitting's six-year history. Once more chaired by John Bercow, Speaker of the House of Commons, the topics were chosen through 876,488 ballots, around 14.8% of the UK's 11-18-year-old population. The proceedings were broadcast on Parliament's website as tradition but were only shown through the [[BBC]] via their Democracy Live Site; the reason for this was due to the [[Scottish National Party]]'s Annual Autumn Conference commencing that day. However, it was broadcast between 20:20-00:00 on [[BBC Parliament]] that day to give chance for viewers to watch if they couldn't watch online. Also, for the first time the event was covered by [[Sky News]] on the world's biggest video sharing site, [[YouTube]] through their 'Stand Up Be Counted' campaign, which was launched in the summer of 2014.\n\nBefore the debates on campaigns occurred, MYPs held a special commemoration marking the 100th anniversary of the start of [[World War I]]. Thirteen MYPs were selected by a video application process to speak from the Dispatch Boxes on how the war affected either their families of region followed by one minute of silence. This was agreed on at UKYP's Annual Sitting in Lancaster that summer.\n\nOnce the debates and speeches from [[Leader of the House of Commons]], [[William Hague]], [[Natascha Engel]] MP and [[Tessa Munt]] MP had taken place, the following information shows the results of the two votes; one for the UK-wide 2015 issue and like 2013's debate, one devolved issue for England:\n\nUK-wide issue: \n*Everyone should be paid at least the Living Wage: 156 \n*Votes for 16- and 17-year-olds in all public elections: 117\n\nEngland-wide issue:\n*Mental health services should be improved with our help: 176\n*Better work experience and careers advice: 78\n*Bring back exam resits in English and Maths: 32\n\nTherefore, 'Everyone should be paid at least the Living Wage' was chosen as UKYP's UK Campaign for 2015 whiles 'Mental Health services should be improved by our help' became UKYP's 2015 Campaign for England.\n\n==== 2015 ====\n\nThe 2015 sitting took place on 13 November, following the counting of 969,992 Make Your Mark Ballots that were cast through the ballot.\n\nAfter the debates occurred, a special 30 minute debate entitled \"My Magna Carta\" was held, 800 years after the historic document was first signed.\n\nThe information below states the results of the ballots, to choose what of the debated topics would become the two priority campaigns for 2016:\n\nUK Wide:\n\n\u2022\tWorking together to combat racism and religious discrimination: 155\n\n\u2022\tEveryone should be paid at least the Living Wage: 117\n\nTackling Racism and Religious Discrimination therefore became the UK Wide campaign for 2016, and became the inquiry subject for the year's Youth Select Committee.\n\nDevolved:\n\n\u2022\tMental health services should be improved with our help: 176\n\n\u2022\tA curriculum to prepare us for life: 110\n\n\u2022\tMake public transport cheaper, better and accessible for all: 33\n\nThe existing Mental Health campaign was therefore re-selected as the devolved campaign for 2016.\n\n==== 2019 Sitting - amongst the General Election campaign ====\n\nDespite the calling of the [[2019 United Kingdom general election]], the sitting still went ahead and took place on November 8th 2019. The debates were chaired for the first time by both the new Speaker [[Lindsay Hoyle | Sir Lindsay Hoyle]] and fellow speakership candidate and current 1st Deputy Speaker [[Eleanor Laing | Dame Eleanor Laing]]. \n\nAs has been for each sitting, the Make Your Mark ballot determined the topics and overall saw just over 840,000 young people take part across the United Kingdom in 2019, with the motion on Protecting the Environment becoming the parliament's UK wise campaign for 2020 and Ending Knife Crime being chosen by MYP's as the devolved campaign topic.\n\nThe full results were as follows:\n\n'''UK Wide Campaign Topic'''\n\nProtecting the Climate - 179\n\nTackling Hate Crime - 68\n\n'''Devolved Campaign Topic'''\n\nMental Health - 69\n\nCurriculum to Prepare us for Life - 86\n\nPut an End to Knife Crime - 87\n\nFor the first time, the UK wide campaign topic will be launched as a Parliamentary E-Petition of which will be debated in the Commons chamber, if 100,000 members of the public sign it. The petition will be launched in early 2020.\n\nDue to dissolution of Parliament and it having taken place on November 6th 2019 (being prior to November 8th's proceedings), full broadcasting of the debates along with the publication of media reports, under election regulations were not published until 16th December 2019 - the week following the election. Full proceedings were made available on Parliament's YouTube channel that morning.\n\n==== Paul Boskett Memorial Trophy ====\n\nIn 2014 the introduction of the Paul Boskett Debate Lead Trophy was introduced. Every region elects someone to represent them and speak at the Dispatch Box and the strongest speaker is now awarded; the name comes from the late Paul Boskett MBE, who died in 2014 aged 59; he worked and was a lead figure within the [[British Youth Council]]. Paul is cited as a major inspiration for many young people and seen as a key champion of youth voice. The first Debate Lead Champion was Ife Grillo who sat as a Vice Chair to the British Youth Council between 2015-2017 and at the time of the Commons debate on 14 November 2014, represented the London Borough of Hackney.\n\n== Regional ==\nMembers of Youth Parliament in England are split into nine geographical regions, which meet and work together regularly: [[London]], [[East Midlands]], [[West Midlands (region)|West Midlands]], [[South West England|South West]], [[South East England|South East]], [[North West England|North West]], [[North East England|North East]], [[Yorkshire and the Humber]], [[East of England]].\n\nRegional meetings known as conventions take place three times a year (June, October and December) and last around a day. Members share news, issues and resources, in addition to taking part in training to help them in their role, relevant Government Consultations and within the October Convention, Elections occur to decide regional representatives to be a Debate Lead for UKYP's House of Commons Debate and the UKYP Procedure's Group for the following year (1 February to 31 January).\n\n== Campaigns ==\nThe UK Youth Parliament launched the \"Make Your Mark\" ballot in 2011. The purpose of the ballot to get young people from across the UK to determine which five topics the UK Youth Parliament would debate within the House of Commons. Over 65,000 young people completed the ballot after several months of campaigning.\n\nThe first five issues debated in the House of Commons chamber through 'Make Your Mark' were:\n# \"Make public transport cheaper, better and accessible for all\"\n# \"No to tuition fees, yes to graduate tax\"\n# \"Zero tolerance towards bullying in schools\"\n# \"End child poverty\"\n# \"A Greener future for Britain\"\n\nOn 4 November 2011, Members of Youth Parliament came from across the UK to debate and vote at House of Commons the most important issue to campaign on in 2012. The winning campaign topic was \"Make public transport cheaper, better and accessible for all\".\n\n2012's sitting chose \u2018A Curriculum To Prepare Us For Life\u2019 as the 2013 National Campaign. Over 253,000 young people took part.\n\nIn 2013, \u2018Votes For 16 and 17 Year Old's In All Public Elections\u2019 was prioritised as the UK Priority Campaign for 2014, whilst \u2018A Curriculum To Prepare Us For Life\u2019 was voted as the priority campaign for England. A new record of 478,386 young people cast a vote.\n\nIn 2014  876,488 young people helped to choose the House of Commons topics; over 14.8% of the UK's 11-18 year old population. 'Everyone should be paid at least the Living Wage' was chosen as UKYP's UK Campaign for 2015 with a National Campaign Day occurring on 24 January 2015. Also 'Mental Health services should be improved by our help' became UKYP's 2015 Campaign for England.\n\n2015 recorded 969,992 votes and saw that year's Commons Debate select Mental Health chosen as the England Campaign issue and Tackling Racism & Discrimination as the UK priority topic to campaign on.\n\n2016 saw another increase in MYM's total, with 978,216 having there say and as a result of that year's debates on the famous Green Benches, saw Votes at 16 be selected as the England campaign issue and a Curriculum for Life for the 2nd time be the national priority campaign topic.\n\nIn 2017, the Make Your Mark for the first time in the ballot's history fell, to 954,766 - of which however was widely still seen as an impressive total considering the scale of Youth Provision cuts since 2010. Both issues chosen in 2016, of a Curriculum for Life and Votes at 16 were once again selected by MYP's to be the priority campaign topics, however with them being switched in relation to the campaign area, meaning Votes at 16 took national precedent and a Curriculum for Life reverted to England only focus.\n\n2018's Ballot has written history and seen a initial total of 1,022,286 votes be declared, marking the first time Make Your Mark has exceeded 7 figures; with an increased and revised 2nd total to be announced on 24 October 2018, along with the Commons Debate topics for this year's proceedings - to be held on 9 November 2018.\n\n== Organisation ==\n\n=== Governance ===\n\n==== Steering Group ====\nDecisions regarding the development and progression of the organisation is undertaken by the Steering Group, made up of one MYP elected from each region and nation (known as \"SGs\"), for a 12-month term from 1 February to 31 January the following year. Their main focus is \"key decisions relating to the membership and the programme of work, within the given strategic boundaries\".<ref name=\"Accounts2008\">{{cite web |url=http://www.charity-commission.gov.uk/registeredcharities/ScannedAccounts/Ends16%5C0001084716_ac_20080331_e_c.pdf|title=Democracy for Young People Accounts 31 Mar 2008|publisher=[[Charity Commission]]|pages=4|accessdate=2009-11-03}}{{dead link|date=October 2017|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}} </ref>\n\nThey meet a minimum of four times a year to represent their regions nationally, coordinate campaign efforts and organise events such as the Annual Conference. Reports are taken back to MYPs at their regional conventions & other meetings.\n\nThe name of the group was changed from Procedures Group to Steering Group in November 2019 in order to reflect the groups varied responsibilities better.\n\n==== Management and support ====\n \nThe [[British Youth Council]] manages the UK Youth Parliament. The British Youth Council won a bid in 2011, granted by the [[Department for Education]] to lead a national Youth Voice Service. Youth Voice will support young people in influencing local and national Government decision making in England, and provide continued support for the UK Youth Parliament.\n\nThe corporate and administrative governance is overseen by the Board of Trustees of the [[British Youth Council]].\n\n== Reception ==\n\n=== Praise ===\nThe organisation has been endorsed by former Prime Ministers [[Gordon Brown]] and [[David Cameron]].

The civil engineer [[Augustin-Jean Fresnel]] entered this competition by submitting a new [[wave theory of light]].<ref name=\"fresnel1868\">{{Citation \n| last = Fresnel | first = A.J.\n| year =1868\n| title = OEuvres Completes 1\n| publisher = Imprimerie imp\u00e9riale\n| location = Paris\n| url = https://books.google.com/books/about/%C5%92uvres_compl%C3%A8tes_d_Augustin_Fresnel_Th.html?id=3QgAAAAAMAAJ\n}}</ref> [[Sim\u00e9on Denis Poisson]], one of the members of the judging committee, studied Fresnel's theory in detail. Being a supporter of the particle-theory of light, he looked for a way to disprove it. Poisson thought that he had found a flaw when he demonstrate that Fresnel's theory predicts that an on-axis bright spot would exist in the shadow of a circular obstacle, where there should be complete darkness according to the particle-theory of light. The [[Poisson spot]] is not easily observed in every-day situations, so it was only natural for Poisson to interpret it as an absurd result and that it should disprove Fresnel's theory. However, the head of the committee, [[Fran\u00e7ois Arago|Dominique-Fran\u00e7ois-Jean Arago]], and who incidentally later became Prime Minister of France, decided to perform the experiment in more detail. He molded a 2-mm metallic disk to a glass plate with wax.<ref name=\"fresnel1868_arago\">{{Citation \n| last = Fresnel | first = A.J.\n| year =1868\n| title = OEuvres Completes 1\n| publisher = Imprimerie imp\u00e9riale\n| location = Paris\n| page = 369\n| url = https://books.google.com/books/about/%C5%92uvres_compl%C3%A8tes_d_Augustin_Fresnel_Th.html?id=3QgAAAAAMAAJ\n}}</ref> To everyone's surprise he succeeded in observing the predicted spot, which convinced most scientists of the wave-nature of light.\n[[File:Acta Eruditorum - I orologi, 1737 \u2013 BEIC 13458392.jpg|thumb|Illustration from [[Acta Eruditorum]] (1737) where was published ''Machines et inventions approuv\u00e9es par l'Academie Royale des Sciences'']]\nFor three centuries women were not allowed as members of the Academy. This meant that many women scientists were excluded, including two-time Nobel Prize winner [[Marie Curie]], Nobel winner [[Ir\u00e8ne Joliot-Curie]], mathematician [[Sophie Germain]], and many other deserving women scientists. The first woman admitted as a correspondent member was a student of Curie's, [[Marguerite Perey]], in 1962.

The last member to be removed from the academy was in 1944. Removal from the academy was often for not preforming to standards, not preforming at all, leaving the country, or political reasons. In some rare occasions, a member has been elected twice and subsequently removed twice.

But as the members nominated constituted only one third of the membership and most of these had previously been elected as members of the respective Academies under the old regime, few objections were raised. Moreover, these nominated members were then completely free to nominate the remaining members of the institute. Members expected to remain such for life, but interference occurred in a few cases where the government suddenly terminated membership for political reasons. The other main interference came when the government refused to accept the result of Academy elections.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Crosland|first=Maurice|title=Science Under Control The French Academy of Sciences 1795-1914|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1992|isbn=0521413737|location=Great Britain|pages=303}}</ref> The academies control by the government was apparent in 1803, when Bonaparte decided on a general reorganization. His principal concern was not the First class but the Second, which included political scientists who were potential critics of his government.

Some individuals like [[Fran\u00e7ois Magendie|Francois Magendie]] had made stellar advancements in their selected fields of study, that warranted a possible addition of new fields. However, even someone like Magendie that had made breakthroughs in [[Physiology]] and impressed the Academy with his hands-on experimentation, could not get his study into its own category.<ref name=\":0\" /> Despite Magendie being one of the leading innovators of his time, it was still a battle for him to become an official member of the Academy, a feat he would later accomplish in 1821.<ref name=\":0\" /> He further improved the reverence of the academy when he produced the widely known \"[[Bell\u2013Magendie law|Bell-Magendie Law]]\". \u00a0\n\nFrom 1795 until 1914, the first world war, the French Academy of Science was the most prevalent organization of French science.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Alter|first=Peter|date=June 1995|title=Science under Control.

Among the exceptions was [[Dominique, comte de Cassini]], who refused to take his seat. Membership in the Academy was not restricted to scientists: in 1798 [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] was elected a member of the Academy and three years later a president in connection with his [[Napoleonic Campaign in Egypt|Egyptian expedition]], which had a scientific component.<ref name=\"alder\">{{citation\n|first=Ken\n|last=Alder\n|title=The Measure of All Things \u2013 The Seven-Year Odyssey and Hidden Error that Transformed the World\n|publisher=[[Free Press (publisher)|The Free Press]]\n|year=2002\n|isbn=0-7432-1675-X\n|url-access=registration\n|url=https://archive.org/details/measureofallthin00alde\n}}</ref> In 1816, the again renamed \"Royal Academy of Sciences\" became autonomous, while forming part of the [[Institute of France]]; the head of State became its patron. In the [[French Second Republic|Second Republic]], the name returned to Acad\u00e9mie des sciences. During this period, the Academy was funded by and accountable to the [[Minister of National Education (France)|Ministry of Public Instruction]].<ref>{{harvnb|Crosland|1992}}</ref>\nThe Academy came to control French patent laws in the course of the eighteenth century, acting as the liaison of artisans' knowledge to the public domain. As a result, [[academician]]s dominated technological activities in France.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Hahn |first1=Roger |title=The Anatomy of a Scientific Institution: The Paris Academy of Sciences, 1666-1803 |date=1971 |publisher=University of California Press |location=Berkeley, California |isbn=0-520-01818-4 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/anatomyofscienti0000hahn/page/187 187-189] |url=https://archive.org/details/anatomyofscienti0000hahn/page/187 }}</ref>\nThe Academy proceedings were published under the name ''[[Comptes rendus de l'Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences]]'' (1835\u20131965). The ''Comptes rendus'' is now a journal series with seven titles. The publications can be found on site of the [[Biblioth\u00e8que nationale de France|French National Library]].\n\nIn 1818 the French Academy of Sciences launched a competition to explain the properties of light. The civil engineer [[Augustin-Jean Fresnel]] entered this competition by submitting a new [[wave theory of light]].<ref name=\"fresnel1868\">{{Citation \n| last = Fresnel | first = A.J.\n| year =1868\n| title = OEuvres Completes 1\n| publisher = Imprimerie imp\u00e9riale\n| location = Paris\n| url = https://books.google.com/books/about/%C5%92uvres_compl%C3%A8tes_d_Augustin_Fresnel_Th.html?id=3QgAAAAAMAAJ\n}}</ref> [[Sim\u00e9on Denis Poisson]], one of the members of the judging committee, studied Fresnel's theory in detail. Being a supporter of the particle-theory of light, he looked for a way to disprove it. Poisson thought that he had found a flaw when he demonstrate that Fresnel's theory predicts that an on-axis bright spot would exist in the shadow of a circular obstacle, where there should be complete darkness according to the particle-theory of light. The [[Poisson spot]] is not easily observed in every-day situations, so it was only natural for Poisson to interpret it as an absurd result and that it should disprove Fresnel's theory. However, the head of the committee, [[Fran\u00e7ois Arago|Dominique-Fran\u00e7ois-Jean Arago]], and who incidentally later became Prime Minister of France, decided to perform the experiment in more detail. He molded a 2-mm metallic disk to a glass plate with wax.<ref name=\"fresnel1868_arago\">{{Citation \n| last = Fresnel | first = A.J.\n| year =1868\n| title = OEuvres Completes 1\n| publisher = Imprimerie imp\u00e9riale\n| location = Paris\n| page = 369\n| url = https://books.google.com/books/about/%C5%92uvres_compl%C3%A8tes_d_Augustin_Fresnel_Th.html?id=3QgAAAAAMAAJ\n}}</ref> To everyone's surprise he succeeded in observing the predicted spot, which convinced most scientists of the wave-nature of light.\n[[File:Acta Eruditorum - I orologi, 1737 \u2013 BEIC 13458392.jpg|thumb|Illustration from [[Acta Eruditorum]] (1737) where was published ''Machines et inventions approuv\u00e9es par l'Academie Royale des Sciences'']]\nFor three centuries women were not allowed as members of the Academy. This meant that many women scientists were excluded, including two-time Nobel Prize winner [[Marie Curie]], Nobel winner [[Ir\u00e8ne Joliot-Curie]], mathematician [[Sophie Germain]], and many other deserving women scientists. The first woman admitted as a correspondent member was a student of Curie's, [[Marguerite Perey]], in 1962.  The first female full member was [[Yvonne Choquet-Bruhat]] in 1979. {{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nMembership in the academy is highly geared towards representing common [[Demographics of France|French populace demographics]]. French population increases and changes in the early 21st century lead to the academy expanding reference population sizes by reform in the early 2002.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Leridon|first=Henri|date=2004|title=The Demography of a Learned Society: The Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences (Institut de France), 1666-2030|url=|journal=Population|volume=59|pages=86|via=JSTOR}}</ref>\n\nThe overwhelming majority of members leave the academy posthumously, with a few exceptions of removals, transfers, and resignations. The last member to be removed from the academy was in 1944. Removal from the academy was often for not preforming to standards, not preforming at all, leaving the country, or political reasons. In some rare occasions, a member has been elected twice and subsequently removed twice. This is the case for [[Marie-Adolphe Carnot]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Leridon|first=Henri|date=2004|title=The Demography of a Learned Society: The Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences (Institut de France), 1666-2030|url=|journal=Population|volume=59|pages=90|via=JSTOR}}</ref>\n\n== Government Interference ==\nThe most direct involvement of the government in the affairs of the institute came in the initial nomination of members in 1795. But as the members nominated constituted only one third of the membership and most of these had previously been elected as members of the respective Academies under the old regime, few objections were raised. Moreover, these nominated members were then completely free to nominate the remaining members of the institute. Members expected to remain such for life, but interference occurred in a few cases where the government suddenly terminated membership for political reasons. The other main interference came when the government refused to accept the result of Academy elections.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Crosland|first=Maurice|title=Science Under Control The French Academy of Sciences 1795-1914|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1992|isbn=0521413737|location=Great Britain|pages=303}}</ref> The academies control by the government was apparent in 1803, when Bonaparte decided on a general reorganization. His principal concern was not the First class but the Second, which included political scientists who were potential critics of his government. Bonaparte abolished the second class completely and, after a few expulsions, redistributed its remaining members, together with those of the Third class, into a new Second class concerned with literature and a new Third class devoted to the fine arts. Still this relationship between the Academy and the government wasn't a one way affair, as members expected to receive their payment of an honorarium.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Crosland|first=Maurice|title=Science Under Control The French Academy of Sciences 1795-1914|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1992|isbn=0521413737|location=Great Britain|pages=302}}</ref>\n\n== Decline of the Academy ==\nAlthough the Academy still exists today, after World war one, the reputation and status of the Academy was largely questioned.<ref name=\":1\" /> One factor of decline was the development from a meritocracy to gerontocracy, in other words; a shift from people with scientific ability leading the Academy to people who had been there longer leading it.<ref name=\":1\" /> It became known as a sort of \u201chall of fame\u201d that lost control, real and symbolic, of the professional scientific diversity in France at the time.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n== The Academy today ==\n[[Image:Institut France.jpg|thumb|right|<center>The [[Institut de France]] in Paris where the Academy is housed</center>]]\nToday the Academy is one of five academies comprising the [[Institut de France]].
