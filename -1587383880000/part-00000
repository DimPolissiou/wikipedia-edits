She was the eldest daughter of [[Amalric I of Jerusalem]] and [[Agnes of Courtenay]], sister of [[Baldwin IV of Jerusalem|Baldwin IV]] and half-sister of [[Isabella I of Jerusalem]], and mother of [[Baldwin V of Jerusalem]]. Her grandmother [[Melisende of Jerusalem|Melisende]] had provided an example of successful rule by a [[queen regnant]] earlier in the century.\n\nMAINCRA\n\n==Baldwin IV's reign==\nOn their father Amalric's death, Baldwin IV became king in 1174. First [[Miles of Plancy]], then [[Raymond III of Tripoli]] became regent during his minority (although Miles was never regent in title, merely function). In 1176, Baldwin and Raymond arranged for Sibylla to marry [[William of Montferrat, Count of Jaffa and Ascalon|William Longsword of Montferrat]], eldest son of the Marquess [[William V of Montferrat]] and his wife Judith or Ita von Babenberg, and a cousin of [[Louis VII of France]] and of [[Frederick Barbarossa]]. Sibylla was created [[Count of Jaffa and Ascalon|Countess of Jaffa and Ascalon]] (previously held by her mother Agnes), the title increasingly associated with the heir to the throne. In autumn they were married. William died by June the following year, leaving Sibylla pregnant. In the tradition of the dynasty, Sibylla named her son [[Baldwin V of Jerusalem|Baldwin]].\n\nThe widowed princess remained a prize for ambitious nobles and adventurers seeking to advance themselves and take control of Jerusalem. [[Philip I, Count of Flanders|Philip of Flanders]], a first cousin of Sibylla (his mother, [[Sibylla of Anjou]], was her father's half-sister), arrived in 1177 and demanded to have the princess married to one of his own vassals. By marrying Sibylla to his vassal, Philip could control the kingship of Jerusalem. The ''[[Haute Cour of Jerusalem]]'', led by [[Baldwin of Ibelin]], rebuffed Philip's advances. Affronted, Philip left Jerusalem to campaign in [[Antioch]].\n\nSibylla did not remarry until 1180. Popular narrative histories have favoured an account from the 13th century, ''Old French Continuation of William Tyre'', partly attributed to [[Ernoul]], and associated with the Ibelin family. It claims that Sibylla was in love with Balian of Ibelin, a widower over twice her age, but he was captured and imprisoned in 1179 by [[Saladin]]. She wrote to Balian, suggesting they wed when he was released. Saladin demanded a large ransom: Balian himself could not pay the ransom, but was released with the promise to pay Saladin later. Once free, Balian went to the Byzantine court, where he received a grant from [[Manuel I Comnenus|Emperor Manuel]], the emperor previously receiving confirmation from his niece, [[Maria Comnena, Queen consort of Jerusalem|Maria Comnena, the dowager queen]], of the likelihood of the Sibylla-Baldwin match. However, Agnes of Courtenay advised her son to have Sibylla married to the newly arrived Frankish knight [[Guy of Lusignan]], brother of her personal constable, [[Amalric II of Jerusalem|Amalric of Lusignan]], who Ernoul claims was her lover. By this Agnes hoped to foil any attempt by [[Raymond III of Tripoli]] (the former regent) from marrying her daughter into the rival court faction, led by the Ibelins. It claims that Balian of Ibelin was still in Constantinople and unable to wed Sibylla. With pressure mounting to have the [[Heir Presumptive]] wed, the marriage was hastily arranged, and Sibylla&nbsp;\u2014 portrayed as fickle in this account&nbsp;\u2014 transferred her affections to Guy de Lusignan.\n\n[[File:Sibylle-betrothal&marriage.jpg|thumb|left|270px|Top: Baldwin IV betrothes Sibylla to Guy; Bottom: Sibylla and Guy are married. (MS of William of Tyre's ''Historia'' and ''Old French Continuation'', painted in Acre, 13C. ''Bib. Nat. Fran\u00e7aise''.)]]\nThis version of events is contradicted by accounts of [[William of Tyre]] and others. According to this account, a plan to marry Sibylla to [[Hugh III of Burgundy]] had broken down. At [[Easter]] 1180, Raymond of Tripoli and [[Bohemund III of Antioch]] entered the kingdom in force, with the intent of imposing a husband of their own choice, probably Baldwin of Ibelin, on Sibylla. However, a foreign match was essential to the kingdom, bringing the possibility of external military aid. Baldwin IV himself arranged the marriage to Guy, whose brother Amalric, well-regarded and able, had first come to court as Baldwin of Ibelin's son-in-law and was now [[Officers of the Kingdom of Jerusalem|constable of Jerusalem]]. With the new French king [[Philip II of France|Philip II]] a minor, Guy's status as a vassal of the King and Sibylla's first cousin [[Henry II of England]] \u2013 who owed the Pope a penitential pilgrimage&nbsp;\u2014 was useful in terms of offering a source of external help. Baldwin of Ibelin was in Jerusalem at the time of Sibylla's marriage, and did not go to Constantinople until later in the year&nbsp;\u2014 contradicting the claims in the ''Old French Continuation''. Also in 1180, Baldwin IV further curtailed the ambitions of the Ibelins by betrothing the eight-year-old Isabella to [[Humphrey IV of Toron]], removing her from the control of her mother and the Ibelins, and placing her in the hands of her betrothed's family \u2013 [[Raynald of Ch\u00e2tillon]] and his wife [[Stephanie of Milly, Lady of Oultrejordain|Stephanie of Milly]].\n\nSibylla bore Guy two daughters, Alice and Maria (their years of birth are unknown). Initially Baldwin IV vested much authority in Guy, appointing him his regent during times of his own incapacitation. But within a year the king was offended and enraged by Guy's behaviour as regent. Guy overlooked Raynald of Ch\u00e2tillon's harassment of trade caravans between Egypt and Syria, threatening the stop-gap accord between Jerusalem and Egypt. Baldwin IV deposed Guy as regent in 1183 and had Sibylla's son crowned co-king as Baldwin V, thereby passing over her and Guy in the succession. He also attempted to have Sibylla's marriage annulled throughout 1184. Her son was to succeed with Raymond III of Tripoli as regent. If Baldwin V were to expire during his minority, his \"''most rightful heirs''\" would succeed to the regency until his maternal kinsman the [[Henry II of England|King of England]] and paternal kinsmen the [[Philip II of France|King of France]] and the [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Holy Roman Emperor]], and the [[Pope]] should adjudicate between the claims of Sibylla and Isabella. Though her husband was in disgrace for his behaviour as regent, it does not seem that Sibylla herself was held in disfavour.\n\nThroughout these internal political conflicts, an even greater external threat was on the horizon: [[Saladin]], the sultan of Egypt and Syria, who was steadily building up his power-base in preparation for invasion. Meanwhile, Agnes died in [[Akko|Acre]], sometime in 1184.\n\n==Baldwin V and the succession==\nBaldwin IV died in spring 1185, leaving Sibylla's son as sole king, Raymond as regent and the boy's great-uncle Count [[Joscelin III of Edessa]] as guardian. Baldwin V's grandfather, Marquess [[William V of Montferrat]], had also now arrived in the kingdom to give his support. However, the young king, never a healthy child, died in Acre in the summer of 1186, having reigned on his own for just over a year. Neither Sibylla's nor Isabella's party seems to have been prepared to accept the terms of Baldwin IV's will, to install a regent and wait for a decision by Baldwin V's relatives in England, France and Germany.\n\nJoscelin and the Marquess William escorted the king's coffin to Jerusalem. Sibylla attended her son's funeral, arranged by Joscelin. For security, an armed escort garrisoned Jerusalem. Raymond III, who wanted to protect his own influence and his political allies, the dowager queen [[Maria Comnena, Queen consort of Jerusalem|Maria Comnena]] and the Ibelins, went to Nablus&nbsp;\u2014 Maria and Balian's home&nbsp;\u2014 where he summoned those members of the ''Haute Cour'' who supported Isabella. Meanwhile, Sibylla was crowned queen by [[Eraclius of Jerusalem|Patriarch Eraclius]]. Raynald of Ch\u00e2tillon gained popular support for Sibylla by affirming that she was \"li plus apareissanz et plus dreis heis dou roiaume\" (\"the most evident and rightful heir of the kingdom\"). Sibylla's detractors resurrected the claim that Sibylla was illegitimate and intended to hold a rival coronation for Isabella. However, in 1163 the Latin Church of Jerusalem had ruled Sibylla was a legal heir and successor to her father. Either way, Sibylla's claim held strong as the ''Haute Cour'' negotiated to recognize her as queen. Sibylla's position was further strengthened when Isabella's husband, [[Humphrey IV of Toron]], Raynald of Ch\u00e2tillon's stepson, left Nablus to swear fealty to Sibylla and Guy.\n\nSibylla was crowned alone, as sole Queen. Before her crowning Sibylla agreed with oppositional court members that she would annul her own marriage to please them, as long as she would be given free rein to choose her next husband. (This followed the precedent of her own parents.) The leaders of the ''Haute Cour'' agreed, and Sibylla was crowned forthwith. To their astonishment, Sibylla immediately announced that she chose Guy as her husband, and crowned him.\n\nOf Queen Sibylla's right to rule, Bernard Hamilton wrote \"there is no real doubt, following the precedent of Melisende, that Sibylla, as the elder daughter of King Amalric, had the best claim to the throne; equally, there could be no doubt after the ceremony that Guy only held the [[crown matrimonial]].\"\n\n==Sibylla's reign==\nSibylla had shown great cunning and political prowess in her dealings with the members of the opposition faction. She had some support from her maternal relations, the Courtenay family (the former dynasty of the [[County of Edessa]]) and their allies and vassals, while her rivals were led by Raymond of Tripoli, who had a claim to the throne in his own right, the Ibelin family and the dowager queen in Nablus on behalf of Isabella.\n\nQueen Sibylla's chief concern was to check the progress of Saladin's armies as they advanced into the kingdom. Guy and Raymond were dispatched to the front with the entire fighting strength of the kingdom, but their inability to cooperate was fatal, and Saladin routed them at the [[Battle of Hattin]] on July 4, 1187. Guy was among the prisoners. The dowager queen joined her stepdaughter in Jerusalem as Saladin's army advanced. By September 1187, Saladin was besieging the Holy City, and Sibylla personally led the defence, along with Patriarch Eraclius and [[Balian of Ibelin]], who had survived Hattin. [[Siege of Jerusalem (1187)|Jerusalem capitulated]] on October 2, and Sibylla was permitted to escape to [[Tripoli, Lebanon|Tripoli]] with her daughters.\n\n==Death==\nGuy was released from his imprisonment in [[Damascus]] in 1188, when Saladin realized that returning him would cause strife in the crusader camp and that Guy was a less capable leader than certain others who now held sway. The queen joined him when they marched on [[Tyre (Lebanon)|Tyre]] in 1189, the only city in the kingdom that had not fallen. [[Conrad of Montferrat]], brother of Sibylla's first husband William, had taken charge of the city's defences. However, he denied them entrance, refusing to recognise Guy's claim to the remnant of the kingdom, and asserting his own claim to hold it until the arrival of the kings from Europe (in accordance with Baldwin IV's will). After about a month spent outside the city's walls, the queen followed Guy when he led a vanguard of the newly arrived [[Third Crusade]] against Muslim-held Acre, desiring to make that town the seat of the kingdom. Guy besieged the town for two years (see [[Siege of Acre (1189\u20131191)|Siege of Acre]]).\n\nThere, during the stalemate in July or August, possibly July 25, 1190, Sibylla died in an epidemic which was sweeping through the military camp. Her two young daughters had also died some days earlier. (Acre was afterwards conquered in July 1191, mostly by troops brought by [[Philip II of France]] and [[Richard I of England]]).\n\nBernard Hamilton wrote \"had Sibylla lived in more peaceful times she would have exercised a great deal of power since her husband's authority patently derived from her\", and that only the conquest by Saladin brought her rule to a speedy end. Her legal successor was her half-sister Isabella, who was forced to end her marriage to Humphrey of Toron and instead to marry Conrad, but Guy refused to relinquish his crown until an election in 1192.\n\n==In fiction==\nSibylla has appeared in several novels, notably [[Zofia Kossak-Szczucka]]\u2019s \u201c''Kr\u00f3l tr\u0119dowaty''\u201d (\u201c''The Leper King''\u201d), [[Graham Shelby]]\u2019s \u201c''The Knights of Dark Renown''\u201d, Helena P. Schrader\u2019s \u201c''Balian d' Ibelin Trilogy''\u201d, [[Elizabeth Chadwick]]\u2019s \u201c''Templar Silks''\u201d, [[Cecelia Holland]]'s \u201c''Jerusalem''\u201d, Scott R. Rezer\u2019s self published book \u201c''The Pawns of Sion''\u201d and [[Sharon Kay Penman]]\u2019s book \u201c''The Land beyond The Sea''\u201d.\n\nKossak, Shelby and Schrader portray her in a negative fashion, the third of them depicting her as physically unattractive and prone to emotionally melodramatic outbursts with the first two of them depicting her as beautiful yet otherwise all three depict her as still petulantly stubborn and enthralled to intrigue fueled by and eventually enough doomed by her own romantic love pursuits fueled devotion to Guy de Lusignan that time and again shows to be a weakness for her due to how it pollutes her judgement. Schrader also depicts Sibylla as resentful of her stepmother Maria Comnena and half-sister and stepsister Isabella, partially so out of natural devotion as a daughter to her mother Agnes de Courtenay.\n\nHolland makes her a heroic character for her book, but ignores her known devotion to Guy to invent a doomed romance for her with a Templar Knight. She also depicts Sibylla as highly idealistic including in her and Baldwin IV\u2019s efforts to strive for peace with The Saracens, and furthermore with said Templar character, she catches onto the schemes to use for personal ends her husband Guy her uncle Count Joscelin, Sir Raynald de Ch\u00e2tillon and Templar Knighthood Order Grandmaster [[G\u00e9rard de Ridefort|Sir G\u00e9rard de Ridefort]], the third of whom is the top high leading primary main antagonist of Holland\u2019s book, is archenemies with said Templar character and who\u2019s name is spelled \u201cGerard de Ridford\u201d. Razer also makes her such a character for his book which takes place after his book also called \u201c''The Leper King''\u201d, the whole internal chronological storyline for each of which shows her as at first romantically in love with Guy but soon becomes estranged with him, in part after learning of his being used as a pawn by \u201cThe Order Of Sion\u201d.\n\n[[Sharon Kay Penman|Sharon Key Penman]]'s \u201c''The Land Beyond the Sea''\u201d, like Chadwick\u2019s \u201c''Templar Silks''\u201d, spells Sibylla\u2019s name as \u201cSybilla. Furthermore Penman\u2019s book depicts her as with no ill will towards either of her stepmother nor stepsister and half-sister Maria and Isabella, though is, at first, still wishing to please her mother Agnes but grows tired and resentful of the times that Agnes - who is depicted as prone to doing so with anyone else who provokes her - verbally lashes out at her. Penman depicts her also as falling in love with Guy in part when the latter shows sympathy to her after ending up as catching onto a verbal confrontation between the former and her mother that embarrasses the former enough in front of others to take her leave from her mother, leading to the two of them discussing bits and pieces of their youth with Guy admitting himself to - as depicted in Penman\u2019s book - quite so indeed having gone through issues of his own with his father primarily involving favouritism of Guy\u2019s older brothers based on Guy himself being the youngest brother of them all, and the two of himself and Sibylla growing close to and falling in love in part primarily due to their ability to understand where comes from does and their sympathy for each other.\n\nA far more fictionalized version of Sibylla is played by [[Eva Green]] in the [[2005 in film|2005 movie]] ''[[Kingdom of Heaven (film)|Kingdom of Heaven]]''. In this, she is depicted as unhappily married, and has an affair with [[Balian of Ibelin]]. In the movie, she does not want Guy to take the throne, and participates in a failed plot aimed at his murder. In the Director's Cut, it is suggested that she poisons her son, [[Baldwin V]], to spare him from suffering from leprosy. Instead of rejoining her husband after his release, she leaves for France with Balian.\n\n==Sources==\n{{commons category|Sibylla of Jerusalem}}\n*Hamilton, Bernard. \"Women in the Crusader States: The Queens of Jerusalem.\" ''Medieval Women'', edited by Derek Baker.

She was the eldest daughter of [[Amalric I of Jerusalem]] and [[Agnes of Courtenay]], sister of [[Baldwin IV of Jerusalem|Baldwin IV]] and half-sister of [[Isabella I of Jerusalem]], and mother of [[Baldwin V of Jerusalem]]. Her grandmother [[Melisende of Jerusalem|Melisende]] had provided an example of successful rule by a [[queen regnant]] earlier in the century.\n\n==Dynasty==\nShe was born into the [[Franks|Frankish]] noble family of the [[House of Ch\u00e2teaudun|House of Anjou]] (descending from [[Ingelger]]). Sibylla was raised by her great-aunt, the [[abbot|Abbess]] [[Ioveta of Bethany]], sister of former Queen [[Melisende of Jerusalem]], who founded the [[Tomb of Lazarus|convent of St. Lazarus]] in Bethany for her sister in 1128, and died there in 1163. In the convent Sibylla was taught scripture and other church traditions.\n\nIn 1174, her father sent [[Frederick de la Roche]], [[archbishop of Tyre]], on a diplomatic legation to Europe to drum up support (martial and financial) for the Crusader states, and to arrange a suitable marriage for Sibylla. As her only brother Baldwin suffered from an illness later confirmed as [[leprosy]], Sibylla's marriage was of paramount concern. Frederick convinced [[Stephen I of Sancerre]], a well-connected young nobleman, to come east and marry the princess. Shortly after his arrival in Jerusalem, however, Stephen changed his mind (the reason is not known) and he returned to France.\n\n==Baldwin IV's reign==\nOn their father Amalric's death, Baldwin IV became king in 1174. First [[Miles of Plancy]], then [[Raymond III of Tripoli]] became regent during his minority (although Miles was never regent in title, merely function).

Sibylla was created [[Count of Jaffa and Ascalon|Countess of Jaffa and Ascalon]] (previously held by her mother Agnes), the title increasingly associated with the heir to the throne.

To their astonishment, Sibylla immediately announced that she chose Guy as her husband, and crowned him.\n\nOf Queen Sibylla's right to rule, Bernard Hamilton wrote \"there is no real doubt, following the precedent of Melisende, that Sibylla, as the elder daughter of King Amalric, had the best claim to the throne; equally, there could be no doubt after the ceremony that Guy only held the [[crown matrimonial]].\"\n\n==Sibylla's reign==\nSibylla had shown great cunning and political prowess in her dealings with the members of the opposition faction. She had some support from her maternal relations, the Courtenay family (the former dynasty of the [[County of Edessa]]) and their allies and vassals, while her rivals were led by Raymond of Tripoli, who had a claim to the throne in his own right, the Ibelin family and the dowager queen in Nablus on behalf of Isabella.\n\nQueen Sibylla's chief concern was to check the progress of Saladin's armies as they advanced into the kingdom. Guy and Raymond were dispatched to the front with the entire fighting strength of the kingdom, but their inability to cooperate was fatal, and Saladin routed them at the [[Battle of Hattin]] on July 4, 1187. Guy was among the prisoners. The dowager queen joined her stepdaughter in Jerusalem as Saladin's army advanced. By September 1187, Saladin was besieging the Holy City, and Sibylla personally led the defence, along with Patriarch Eraclius and [[Balian of Ibelin]], who had survived Hattin. [[Siege of Jerusalem (1187)|Jerusalem capitulated]] on October 2, and Sibylla was permitted to escape to [[Tripoli, Lebanon|Tripoli]] with her daughters.\n\n==Death==\nGuy was released from his imprisonment in [[Damascus]] in 1188, when Saladin realized that returning him would cause strife in the crusader camp and that Guy was a less capable leader than certain others who now held sway. The queen joined him when they marched on [[Tyre (Lebanon)|Tyre]] in 1189, the only city in the kingdom that had not fallen. [[Conrad of Montferrat]], brother of Sibylla's first husband William, had taken charge of the city's defences. However, he denied them entrance, refusing to recognise Guy's claim to the remnant of the kingdom, and asserting his own claim to hold it until the arrival of the kings from Europe (in accordance with Baldwin IV's will). After about a month spent outside the city's walls, the queen followed Guy when he led a vanguard of the newly arrived [[Third Crusade]] against Muslim-held Acre, desiring to make that town the seat of the kingdom. Guy besieged the town for two years (see [[Siege of Acre (1189\u20131191)|Siege of Acre]]).\n\nThere, during the stalemate in July or August, possibly July 25, 1190, Sibylla died in an epidemic which was sweeping through the military camp. Her two young daughters had also died some days earlier. (Acre was afterwards conquered in July 1191, mostly by troops brought by [[Philip II of France]] and [[Richard I of England]]).\n\nBernard Hamilton wrote \"had Sibylla lived in more peaceful times she would have exercised a great deal of power since her husband's authority patently derived from her\", and that only the conquest by Saladin brought her rule to a speedy end. Her legal successor was her half-sister Isabella, who was forced to end her marriage to Humphrey of Toron and instead to marry Conrad, but Guy refused to relinquish his crown until an election in 1192.\n\n==In fiction==\nSibylla has appeared in several novels, notably [[Zofia Kossak-Szczucka]]\u2019s \u201c''Kr\u00f3l tr\u0119dowaty''\u201d (\u201c''The Leper King''\u201d), [[Graham Shelby]]\u2019s \u201c''The Knights of Dark Renown''\u201d, Helena P. Schrader\u2019s \u201c''Balian d' Ibelin Trilogy''\u201d, [[Elizabeth Chadwick]]\u2019s \u201c''Templar Silks''\u201d, [[Cecelia Holland]]'s \u201c''Jerusalem''\u201d, Scott R. Rezer\u2019s self published book \u201c''The Pawns of Sion''\u201d and [[Sharon Kay Penman]]\u2019s book \u201c''The Land beyond The Sea''\u201d.\n\nKossak, Shelby and Schrader portray her in a negative fashion, the third of them depicting her as physically unattractive and prone to emotionally melodramatic outbursts with the first two of them depicting her as beautiful yet otherwise all three depict her as still petulantly stubborn and enthralled to intrigue fueled by and eventually enough doomed by her own romantic love pursuits fueled devotion to Guy de Lusignan that time and again shows to be a weakness for her due to how it pollutes her judgement. Schrader also depicts Sibylla as resentful of her stepmother Maria Comnena and half-sister and stepsister Isabella, partially so out of natural devotion as a daughter to her mother Agnes de Courtenay.\n\nHolland makes her a heroic character for her book, but ignores her known devotion to Guy to invent a doomed romance for her with a Templar Knight. She also depicts Sibylla as highly idealistic including in her and Baldwin IV\u2019s efforts to strive for peace with The Saracens, and furthermore with said Templar character, she catches onto the schemes to use for personal ends her husband Guy her uncle Count Joscelin, Sir Raynald de Ch\u00e2tillon and Templar Knighthood Order Grandmaster [[G\u00e9rard de Ridefort|Sir G\u00e9rard de Ridefort]], the third of whom is the top high leading primary main antagonist of Holland\u2019s book, is archenemies with said Templar character and who\u2019s name is spelled \u201cGerard de Ridford\u201d. Razer also makes her such a character for his book which takes place after his book also called \u201c''The Leper King''\u201d, the whole internal chronological storyline for each of which shows her as at first romantically in love with Guy but soon becomes estranged with him, in part after learning of his being used as a pawn by \u201cThe Order Of Sion\u201d.\n\n[[Sharon Kay Penman|Sharon Key Penman]]'s \u201c''The Land Beyond the Sea''\u201d, like Chadwick\u2019s \u201c''Templar Silks''\u201d, spells Sibylla\u2019s name as \u201cSybilla. Furthermore Penman\u2019s book depicts her as with no ill will towards either of her stepmother nor stepsister and half-sister Maria and Isabella, though is, at first, still wishing to please her mother Agnes but grows tired and resentful of the times that Agnes - who is depicted as prone to doing so with anyone else who provokes her - verbally lashes out at her. Penman depicts her also as falling in love with Guy in part when the latter shows sympathy to her after ending up as catching onto a verbal confrontation between the former and her mother that embarrasses the former enough in front of others to take her leave from her mother, leading to the two of them discussing bits and pieces of their youth with Guy admitting himself to - as depicted in Penman\u2019s book - quite so indeed having gone through issues of his own with his father primarily involving favouritism of Guy\u2019s older brothers based on Guy himself being the youngest brother of them all, and the two of himself and Sibylla growing close to and falling in love in part primarily due to their ability to understand where comes from does and their sympathy for each other.\n\nA far more fictionalized version of Sibylla is played by [[Eva Green]] in the [[2005 in film|2005 movie]] ''[[Kingdom of Heaven (film)|Kingdom of Heaven]]''. In this, she is depicted as unhappily married, and has an affair with [[Balian of Ibelin]]. In the movie, she does not want Guy to take the throne, and participates in a failed plot aimed at his murder. In the Director's Cut, it is suggested that she poisons her son, [[Baldwin V]], to spare him from suffering from leprosy. Instead of rejoining her husband after his release, she leaves for France with Balian.\n\n==Sources==\n{{commons category|Sibylla of Jerusalem}}\n*Hamilton, Bernard. \"Women in the Crusader States: The Queens of Jerusalem.\" ''Medieval Women'', edited by Derek Baker.

One of Britain's most popular film stars of the 1930s and 1940s, her film appearances included ''[[The Lady Vanishes (1938 film)|The Lady Vanishes]]'' (1938), ''[[Night Train to Munich]]'' (1940), ''[[The Man in Grey]]'' (1943), and ''[[The Wicked Lady]]'' (1945).

She also starred in the television series ''[[Justice (1971 TV series)|Justice]]'' (1971\u201374).\n\n==Early life==\nMargaret Mary Day Lockwood was born on 15 September 1916 in [[Karachi]], [[British India]], to Henry Francis Lockwood, an English administrator of a railway company, and his Scottish third wife Margaret Eveline Waugh.<ref name=\"times-obit\"/> She returned to England in 1920 with her mother, brother 'Lyn' and half-brother Frank, and a further half-sister 'Fay' joined them the following year, but her father remained in Karachi, visiting them infrequently. She also had another half-brother, John, from her father's first marriage, brought up by his mother in Britain.<ref name=\"copac-ward\"/> Lockwood attended [[Sydenham High School]] for girls, and a ladies' school in [[Kensington]], London.<ref name=\"times-obit\"/>\n\nShe began studying for the stage at an early age at the [[Italia Conti Academy of Theatre Arts]], and made her debut in 1928, at the age of 12, at the [[Holborn Empire]] where she played a fairy in ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]''. In December of the following year, she appeared at the [[Scala Theatre]] in the [[pantomime]] ''The Babes in the Wood''.<ref name=\"times-obit\"/> In 1932 she appeared at the [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane]] in ''[[Cavalcade (play)|Cavalcade]]''.\n\n==Career==\nIn 1933, Lockwood enrolled at the [[Royal Academy of Dramatic Art]] in London, where she was seen by a talent scout and signed to a contract.<ref name=\"times-obit\"/> In June 1934 she played Myrtle in ''House on Fire'' at the [[Queen's Theatre]], and on 22 August 1934 appeared as Margaret Hamilton in [[Gertrude E. Jennings|Gertrude Jenning]]'s play ''Family Affairs'' when it premiered at the [[Ambassadors Theatre (London)|Ambassadors Theatre]]; Helene Ferber in ''Repayment'' at the [[Arts Theatre]] in January 1936; Trixie Drew in Henry Bernard's play ''Miss Smith'' at the [[Duke of York's Theatre]] in July 1936; and back at the Queen's in July 1937 as Ann Harlow in ''Ann's Lapse''.\n\n===Films===\nLockwood entered films in 1934, and in 1935 she appeared in the film version of ''[[Lorna Doone (1934 film)|Lorna Doone]]''. For British Lion she was in ''[[The Case of Gabriel Perry]]'' (1935), then was in ''[[Honours Easy]]'' (1935) with [[Greta Nissen]] and ''[[Man of the Moment (1935 film)|Man of the Moment]]'' (1935) with [[Douglas Fairbanks Jnr]]. These were standard [[ing\u00e9nue]] roles. She was the female love interest in ''[[Midshipman Easy]]'' (1935), directed by [[Carol Reed]], who would become crucial to Lockwood's career. She had the lead in ''[[Someday (1935 film)|Someday]]'' (1935), a [[quota quickie]] directed by [[Michael Powell]] and in ''[[Jury's Evidence]]'' (1936), directed by [[Ralph Ince]].\n\nLockwood had a small role in ''[[The Amateur Gentleman (1936 film)|The Amateur Gentleman]]'' (1936), another with Fairbanks. Her profile rose when she appeared opposite [[Maurice Chevalier]] in ''[[The Beloved Vagabond (1936 film)|The Beloved Vagabond]]'' (1936)<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article92488813 |title=TALKIE NEWS |newspaper=[[The Chronicle (Adelaide)|The Chronicle]] |volume=LXXX |issue=4,208 |location=Adelaide |date=8 July 1937 |accessdate=7 May 2016 |page=51 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref>\n\nShe followed it with ''[[Irish for Luck]]'' (1936) and ''[[The Street Singer (1937 film)|The Street Singer]]'' (1937).

Lee dropped out and was replaced by Lockwood. Lockwood so impressed the studio with her performance \u2013 particularly Black, who became a champion of hers \u2013 she signed a three-year contract with [[Gainsborough Pictures]] in June 1937.<ref>{{cite news|title=News of the Screen: ' Woman Chases Man' Opens Today at Music Hall 'George and Margaret' on Warner's Program News From Hollywood|newspaper=New York Times |date= 10 June 1937|page= 27}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=A LADY WHO HAS LOOKS|work=New York Times|date=5 June 1938|page=156}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article222137569 |title=THE LIFE STORY OF MARGARET LOCKWOOD |newspaper=[[The Voice (Hobart)|The Voice]] |volume=26 |issue=28 |location=Tasmania, Australia |date=11 July 1953 |accessdate=12 April 2016 |page=4 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref>\n\nFor Black and director [[Robert Stevenson (director)|Robert Stevenson]] she supported [[Will Fyffe]] in ''[[Owd Bob (1938 film)|Owd Bob]]'' (1938), opposite [[John Loder (actor)|John Loder]].\n\n===British Stardom: ''Bank Holiday'' and ''The Lady Vanishes''===\n[[File:The-Lady-Vanishes-1938.jpg|thumb|[[Catherine Lacey]], Margaret Lockwood and [[Michael Redgrave]] in [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s ''[[The Lady Vanishes (1938 film)|The Lady Vanishes]]'' (1938)]]\nLockwood then had her best chance to-date, being given the lead in ''[[Bank Holiday (film)|Bank Holiday]]'', directed by [[Carol Reed]] and produced by Black.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article205549079 |title=Margaret Lockwood, English Star |newspaper=[[The Age]] |issue=25,771 |location=Victoria, Australia |date=20 November 1937 |accessdate=7 May 2016 |page=6 (\"THE AGE\" LITERARY SUPPLEMENT) |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref> This movie was a hit and launched Lockwood as a star.\n\nEven more popular was her next movie, ''[[The Lady Vanishes (1938 film)|The Lady Vanishes]]'', directed by [[Alfred Hitchcock]], produced by Black and co-starring [[Michael Redgrave]].

Allied to this is the fact that she photographs more than normally easily, and has an extraordinary insight in getting the feel of her lines, to live within them, so to speak, as long as the duration of the picture lasts.

[[Rex Harrison]] was the male star.\n\n''[[Quiet Wedding]]'' (1941) was a comedy directed by [[Anthony Asquith]].

The film was a massive hit, one of the biggest in 1943 Britain, and made all four lead actors into top stars \u2013 at the end of the year, exhibitors voted Lockwood the seventh most popular British star at the box office.\n\nShe appeared in two comedies for Black: ''[[Dear Octopus (film)|Dear Octopus]]'' (1943) with [[Michael Wilding (actor)|Michael Wilding]] from a play by [[Dodie Smith]], and ''[[Give Us the Moon]]'' (1944), with [[Vic Oliver]] directed by [[Val Guest]]. Much more popular than either of these was another melodrama with Arliss and Granger, ''[[Love Story (1944 film)|Love Story]]'' (1944), where she played a terminally ill pianist.\n\nLockwood was reunited with James Mason in ''[[A Place of One's Own]]'' (1945), playing a housekeeper possessed by the spirit of a dead girl, but the film was not a success. ''[[I'll Be Your Sweetheart]]'' (1945) was a musical with Guest and Vic Oliver.\n\n===''The Wicked Lady''===\nLockwood had the biggest success of her career to-date with the title role in ''[[The Wicked Lady]]'' (1945), opposite Mason and [[Michael Rennie]] for director Arliss.

In 1975, film director [[Bryan Forbes]] persuaded her out of an apparent retirement from feature films, to play the role of the Stepmother in what would be her last feature film, ''[[The Slipper and the Rose]]''. This film also included the final feature film appearance of [[Edith Evans]] and one of the last film appearances of [[Kenneth More]].\n\nHer last professional appearance was as [[Alexandra of Denmark|Queen Alexandra]] in [[Royce Ryton]]'s stage play ''Motherdear'' (Ambassadors Theatre, 1980).\n\nMargaret Lockwood was appointed a Commander of the [[Order of the British Empire]] (CBE)<ref>{{cite web |last1=The Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica |title=Margaret Lockwood |url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Margaret-Lockwood |website=Encyclopedia Britannica |accessdate=9 January 2019 |language=en}}</ref> in the [[1981 New Year Honours]].\n\nMargaret Lockwood was apparently the inspiration for ''[[Sean Pertwee]]'''s now infamous death scene in Dog Soldiers.

She was a guest on the [[British Broadcasting Corporation|BBC]]'s radio show ''[[Desert Island Discs]]'' on 25 April 1951.\n\n==Personal life==\nLockwood married Rupert Leon in 1937 (divorced in 1950).<ref>{{cite news|title=Margaret Lockwood Divorced|author=|work=New York Times|date=7 Nov 1950|page=43}}</ref> She lived her final years in seclusion in [[Kingston upon Thames]], dying at the [[Cromwell Hospital]], Kensington, London, from [[cirrhosis of the liver]], aged 73.

His name at baptism was '''Charles Martin'''.\n\nHis main objective was to be crowned king by turning the growing [[Burgundian State]] into a territorially continuous kingdom. He declared himself and his lands independent, bought [[Alsace|Higher Alsace]] and conquered [[County of Zutphen|Zutphen]], [[Duchy of Guelders|Guelders]] and [[Duchy of Lorraine|Lorraine]], uniting at last Burgundian northern and southern possessions. It caused the enmity of several European powers and triggered the [[Burgundian Wars]].\n\nHis early death at the [[Battle of Nancy]] at the hands of [[Swiss mercenaries]] fighting for [[Ren\u00e9 II, Duke of Lorraine]] was of great consequence in European history. The Burgundian domains, long wedged between [[Kingdom of France|France]] and the [[Habsburg]] Empire, were divided, but the precise disposition of the vast and disparate territorial possessions involved was disputed among the European powers for centuries.\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early life===\n\nCharles the Bold was born in [[Dijon]], the son of [[Philip the Good]] and [[Isabella of Portugal (1397\u20131471)|Isabella of Portugal]]. Before the death of his father in 1467, he bore the title of [[Count of Charolais]]; afterwards, he assumed all of his father's titles, including that of \"Grand Duke of the West\". He was also made a [[Knight of the Golden Fleece]] just twenty days after his birth, invested by [[Charles I, Count of Nevers]], and the seigneur de [[Cro\u00ff]].\n\nCharles was brought up under the direction of Jean d'Auxy<ref>Steven J. Gunn and A. Janse, ''The Court As a Stage: England And the Low Countries in the Later Middle Ages'', (Boydell Press, 2006), 121.</ref> and early showed great application alike to academic studies and warlike exercises. His father's court was the most extravagant in Europe at the time, and a centre for the arts and commerce. While he was growing up, Charles witnessed his father's efforts to unite his far-flung and ethnically diverse dominions into a single state, and his own later efforts centered on continuing and securing his father's successes in this endeavor.\n\nIn 1440, at the age of seven, Charles was married to Catherine, daughter of King [[Charles VII of France]] and sister of the [[Dauphin of France|Dauphin]] (later King [[Louis XI of France|Louis XI]]). She was five years older than her husband, and she died in 1446 at the age of 18. They had no children.\n\n[[File:Rogier van der Weyden - Presentation Miniature, Chroniques de Hainaut KBR 9242.jpg|thumb|left|Charles as a boy stands next to his father, Philip the Good. [[Rogier van der Weyden]]'s frontispiece to the ''Chroniques de Hainaut'', c. 1447\u20138 ([[Royal Library of Belgium]])]]\n\nIn 1454, at the age of 21, Charles married a second time. He wanted to marry a daughter of his distant cousin [[Richard Plantagenet, 3rd Duke of York]] (a sister of Kings [[Edward IV of England|Edward IV]] and [[Richard III of England]]), but under terms of the [[Congress of Arras|Treaty of Arras]] of 1435, he was required to marry a French princess. His father chose [[Isabella of Bourbon]], who was three years younger than he was. Isabella was the daughter of Philip the Good's sister [[Agnes of Burgundy, Duchess of Bourbon|Agnes]] and a very distant cousin of Charles VII of France. Isabella died in 1465. Their daughter [[Mary of Burgundy]] was Charles' only surviving child; she inherited all the Burgundian domains before her marriage to [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian of Habsburg]], the son of [[Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor|Holy Roman Emperor Frederick III]].\n\nCharles was on friendly terms with his brother-in-law Louis, the Dauphin of France, who had been a refugee at the court of Burgundy from 1456 until he succeeded his father as king of France in 1461. But Louis began to pursue some of the same policies as his father, for example Louis's later repurchase of the towns on the [[Somme River]] that Louis's father had ceded in 1435 to Charles's father in the Treaty of Arras, which Charles viewed with chagrin. When his father's failing health enabled him to assume the reins of government (which Philip relinquished to him by an act of 12 April 1465), he initiated a policy of hostility toward Louis XI that led to the [[Burgundian Wars]], and he became one of the principal leaders of the [[League of the Public Weal]], an alliance of west European nobles opposed to policies of Louis XI that sought to centralize the royal authority within France.\n\nFor his third wife, Charles was offered the hand of Louis XI's daughter [[Anne of France|Anne]]. The wife he ultimately chose, however, was his second cousin [[Margaret of York]] (who was also a great-grandchild of [[John of Gaunt]]). Upon the death of his father in 1467, Charles was no longer bound by the terms of the Treaty of Arras, and he decided to ally himself with Burgundy's old ally England. Louis did his best to prevent or delay the marriage with Margaret (he even sent French ships to waylay her as she sailed to Sluys), but in the summer of 1468, it was celebrated sumptuously at [[Bruges]], and Charles was made a [[Knight of the Garter]]. The couple had no children, but Margaret devoted herself to her stepdaughter Mary. After Mary's death many years later, she kept Mary's two infant children as long as she was allowed.\n\n===Early battles===\nOn 12 April 1465, Philip relinquished control of the government of his domains to Charles, who spent the next summer prosecuting the [[War of the Public Weal]] against Louis XI. Charles was left master of the field at the [[Battle of Montlh\u00e9ry]] on 13 July 1465,<ref>Richard Vaughan, ''Charles the Bold'', (Boydell Press, 2002), 251.</ref> but this neither prevented the king from re-entering [[Paris, France|Paris]] nor did it assure Charles of a decisive victory. He succeeded, however, in forcing upon Louis the [[Treaty of Conflans]] of 4 October 1465, by which the king restored to him certain towns on the [[Somme (river)|Somme River]], the counties of [[Boulogne-sur-Mer|Boulogne]] and [[Gu\u00eenes]], and various other small territories. During the negotiations for the treaty, his wife Isabella died suddenly at Les Quesnoy on 25 September, making a political marriage suddenly possible. As part of the treaty, Louis promised him the hand of his infant daughter [[Anne of France|Anne]], with the territories of [[Champagne (province)|Champagne]] and [[Ponthieu]] as a [[dowry]], but no marriage ever took place. In the meanwhile, Charles obtained the surrender of [[Ponthieu]].\n\nCharles' concentration on the affairs of France was diverted by the [[Li\u00e8ge Wars|Revolt of Li\u00e8ge]] against his father and the bishop of Li\u00e8ge ([[Louis de Bourbon, Bishop of Li\u00e8ge|Louis of Bourbon]]) and a desire to punish the town of [[Dinant]] in the province of [[Namur (province)|Namur]]. During the wars of the summer of 1465, Dinant celebrated a false rumour that Charles had been defeated at Montlh\u00e9ry by burning him in [[effigy]] and chanting that he was the bastard child of his mother Isabella of Portugal and John of Heinsburg, the previous Bishop of Li\u00e8ge (d. 1455). On 25 August 1466, Charles marched into Dinant, determined to avenge this slur on the honour of his mother, and sacked the city, killing every man, woman and child within. After the death of Charles' father Philip the Good in 1467, the Bishopric of Li\u00e8ge renewed hostilities, but was defeated by Charles at the [[Battle of Brustem]]. Charles made a victorious entry into Li\u00e8ge, dismantled its walls and stripped the city of some of its privileges.\n\n===Treaty of P\u00e9ronne===\n[[File:Karte Haus Burgund 4 EN.png|thumb|Territories of the house of Valois-Burgundy during the reign of Charles the Bold.]]\n{{main|Treaty of P\u00e9ronne (1468)}}\n[[File:Emanuel van Meteren Historie ppn 051504510 MG 8647 Carolus Audax.tif|thumb|Engraving of Charles the Bold]]\n\nAlarmed by the early successes of the new Duke of Burgundy and anxious to settle various questions relating to the execution of the Treaty of Conflans, Louis XI requested a meeting with Charles and daringly placed himself in his hands in the town of [[P\u00e9ronne, Somme|P\u00e9ronne]] in [[Picardy]] in October 1468. In the course of the negotiations, the duke was informed of a fresh revolt of the [[Bishopric of Li\u00e8ge]] secretly fomented by Louis as part of the [[Li\u00e8ge Wars]]. After deliberating for four days on the best way to deal with his adversary, who had foolishly placed himself at his mercy, Charles decided to respect the promise he had given to guarantee Louis's safety and to negotiate with him. At the same time, he forced Louis to assist him in quelling the revolt in Li\u00e8ge. The town was captured and many inhabitants were massacred. Louis chose not to intervene on behalf of his former allies.\n\nAt the expiry of the one year's truce that followed the [[Treaty of P\u00e9ronne (1468)|Treaty of P\u00e9ronne]], the French king accused Charles of [[treason]], cited him to appear before the [[parlement]], and seized some of the towns on the Somme in 1471. The duke retaliated by invading France with a large army; he took possession of [[Nesle]] and massacred its inhabitants. He failed, however, in an attack on [[Beauvais]] and had to content himself with laying waste to the countryside as far as [[Rouen]]. He eventually withdrew without attaining any useful result.\n\n===Domestic policies===\nCharles pursued domestic policies that assisted the growth of his military establishment. To this end, he relinquished at least some of the extravagance that had characterized the court of Burgundy under his father, if not the magnificence of ceremonial events. From the beginning of his reign, he  employed himself in reorganizing his army and the administration of his territories. While retaining the principles of [[Feudalism|feudal recruiting]], he endeavored to establish a system of rigid discipline among his troops that was strengthened by the employment of foreign mercenaries, particularly [[Englishmen]] and [[Italians]], and the augmentation of his [[artillery]]. The economic power that Charles inherited from Philip led to an independent judicial system, a sophisticated administration, and the establishment of local estates.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Jones|first1=Colin|title=The Cambridge Illustrated History of France|year=1994|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0-521-43294-4|page=[https://archive.org/details/cambridgeillustr00jone_0/page/124 124]|edition=1st|url=https://archive.org/details/cambridgeillustr00jone_0|url-access=registration}}</ref>\n\n===Building a kingdom===\nCharles constantly sought to expand the territories under his control. In 1469, [[Sigismund, Archduke of Austria|Archduke Sigismund of Austria]] sold him the [[county of Ferrette]], the Landgraviate of [[Alsace]], and some other towns, reserving to himself the right to repurchase.\n\nIn 1472\u20131473, Charles bought the [[Reversion (law)|reversion]] of the Duchy of [[Guelders]] (i.e. the right to succeed to it) from its duke [[Arnold, Duke of Gelderland|Arnold]], whom he had supported against the rebellion of his son. Not content with being \"the Grand Duke of the West,\" he conceived the project of forming a kingdom of Burgundy or Arles with himself as independent [[sovereignty|sovereign]] and even persuaded the [[Holy Roman Emperor]] [[Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick III]] to assent to crown him a king at [[Trier]]. The ceremony, however, did not take place owing to the emperor's precipitate flight by night in September 1473, which was occasioned by his displeasure at the duke's ambitions.\n\nAt the close of 1473, the [[Burgundian State]] went from [[Charolais, France|Charolais]] in France to the edges of the [[Burgundian Netherlands|Netherlands]]. This made Charles the Bold one of the wealthiest and most powerful nobles in Europe. Indeed, his landholdings and revenue base rivalled those of many of the royal families.<ref>Great Events from History,''The Renaissance & Early Modern Era'', Vol. 1 (1454\u20131600), article author-Clare Callaghan, {{ISBN|1-58765-214-5}}</ref>\n\n===Downfall===\n{{unreferenced section|date=January 2016}}\n[[File:Peter Paul Rubens 144.jpg|upr .uk j. ight|thumb|Charles the Bold by [[Peter Paul Rubens]] (c. 1618).]]\n[[File:Eugene Burnand - Die Flucht Karls des K\u00fchnen.jpg|right|thumb|Charles' flight after the battle of Grandson, by [[Eug\u00e8ne Burnand]] (1894).]]\n[[File:MULO-Charles the Bold corpse.jpg|thumb| The corpse of Charles the Bold discovered after the Battle of Nancy, by [[Auguste Feyen-Perrin]] (1862).]]\nIn the year 1474, Charles began to involve himself in the series of political struggles that ultimately brought about his downfall. He first came into conflict with the [[Sigismund, Archduke of Austria|Archduke Sigismund of Austria]], to whom he refused to restore his possessions in Alsace for the stipulated sum. Then, he quarreled with the [[Growth of the Old Swiss Confederacy#The Burgundy Wars|Swiss]], who supported the free towns in the Upper Rhine in their [[Burgundian Wars#The conflict|revolt]] against the tyranny of the ducal governor [[Peter von Hagenbach]] (who was condemned by a special international tribunal and executed on 9 May 1474). Finally, he antagonized [[Ren\u00e9 II, Duke of Lorraine]], with whom he disputed the succession in the [[Duchy of Lorraine]], which bordered many of his territories. All of these enemies readily joined forces against their common adversary Charles.\n\nCharles suffered a first rebuff in endeavouring to protect his kinsman [[Ruprecht of the Palatinate (Archbishop of Cologne)|Ruprecht of the Palatinate]], [[Archbishop of Cologne]], against his rebel subjects. He spent ten months (July 1474 \u2013 June 1475) besieging the little town of [[Neuss]] on the [[Rhine]] (the [[Siege of Neuss]]), but was compelled by the approach of a powerful imperial army to raise the siege. Moreover, the expedition he had persuaded his brother-in-law Edward IV of England to undertake against Louis XI was stopped by the [[Treaty of Picquigny]] of 29 August 1475. He was more successful in Lorraine, where he seized [[Nancy, France|Nancy]] on 30 November 1475.\n\nFrom Nancy he marched against the Swiss. He saw fit to hang or drown the garrison of [[Grandson, Switzerland|Grandson]] in spite of its capitulation. Grandson was a possession of [[Jacques of Savoy, Count of Romont]], a close ally of Charles, that had been captured recently by the forces of the [[Old Swiss Confederacy|Swiss Confederacy]]. Some days later, on 2 March 1476, Charles was attacked outside the village of [[Concise]] by the confederate army in the [[Battle of Grandson]] and suffered a shameful defeat; he was compelled to flee with a handful of attendants and abandon his artillery along with an immense booty (including his silver bath).\n\nCharles succeeded in raising a fresh army of 30,000 men that he used to fight the [[Battle of Morat]] on 22 June 1476. He was again defeated by the Swiss army, which was assisted by the cavalry of the Duke of Lorraine. On this occasion, unlike the debacle at Grandson, little booty was lost, but Charles did lose about one third of his entire army. The defeated soldiers were pushed into the nearby lake, where they were drowned or shot at while trying to swim to safety on the opposite shore. On 6 October, Charles lost Nancy, which the Duke of Lorraine was able to recover.\n\n===Death at Nancy===\nMaking a last effort, Charles formed a new army and arrived in the dead of winter before the walls of Nancy. Having lost many of his troops through the severe cold, it was with only a few thousand men that he met the joint forces of the Lorrainers and the Swiss, who had come to the relief of the town. He himself perished in the fight, his naked and disfigured body being discovered some days afterward frozen in the nearby river. Charles' head had been cleft in two by a [[halberd]], lances were lodged in his stomach and loins, and his face had been so badly mutilated by wild animals that only his physician was able to identify him by his long fingernails and his old battle scars.\n\nCharles' battered body was initially buried in the ducal church in Nancy, by [[Ren\u00e9 II, Duke of Lorraine]].<ref>E.

The marriage was a happy one and produced his only offspring, [[Mary of Burgundy]] 13 February 1457.<ref name=\"Troyes106\" />\n* On 3 July 1468, Charles married Anne's sister, [[Margaret of York]] (1446\u20131503);<ref name=\"Troyes106\" /> her siblings also included [[Edward IV of England]], [[George, Duke of Clarence]], and [[Richard III of England]]. The marriage was solemnized at [[Damme]], near [[Bruges]], by the bishop of Salisbury.\n\nThe Burgundian possessions passed into the Habsburg empire on the marriage of his one child and heiress Mary to [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor]].\n\n==Byname==\nBurgundian chroniclers described the personality of the duke as austere, virtuous but without pity, pious and chaste, and with an exacerbated sense of honour. His contemporaries named him ''le Hardi'' or ''der K\u00fchne'' (\"the Bold\") or ''le Guerrier'' (\"the Warrior\") or ''le Terrible'' (\"the Terrible\"),<ref>a title derived from his savage behaviour against his enemies, and particularly from a war with France in late 1471.  Frustrated by the refusal of the French to engage in open battle, and angered by French attacks on his unprotected borders in Hainault and Flanders, Charles marched his army back from the Ile-de-France to Burgundian territory, burning more than 2000&nbsp;towns, villages and castles on his way\u2014Taylor, Aline S, ''Isabel of Burgundy'', pp. 212\u2013213</ref> among others, and the epithet that became his byname in history, ''le T\u00e9m\u00e9raire'' (\"the Reckless\"), is already found in Thomas Basin, bishop of Lisieux, who wrote around 1484.\nThese bynames, however, in the 15th century were used as qualifications of his character, but not yet in any systematic fashion, the duke being simply known as ''Charles de Bourgogne''.<ref>Anne Le Cam, ''Charles le T\u00e9m\u00e9raire, un homme et son r\u00eave'', \u00e9ditions In Fine, 1992, pp. 11, 87.</ref>\n\nThe process of the epithet ''le T\u00e9m\u00e9raire'' acquiring the nature of a byname was gradual. In the 17th century, the ''Grand Dictionnaire Historique'' of Louis Moreri mentions ''Charles de Bourgogne, surnomm\u00e9 le Guerrier, le Hardi ou le T\u00e9m\u00e9raire''.\nIn the 18th century,  Dom Plancher still mentions him as ''Charles le Hardi''.\nIn the 19th century, the byname of ''le T\u00e9m\u00e9raire'' became standard in France and Belgium.\n\n==Legacy==\n[[File:Map France 1477-en.svg|thumb|Map of France in 1477; the Burgundian territories are shown in orange]]\nCharles left his unmarried 19-year-old daughter [[Mary of Burgundy|Mary]] as his heir; clearly her marriage would have enormous implications for the political balance of Europe. Both Louis and the Emperor had unmarried eldest sons; Charles had made some movements towards arranging a marriage between Mary and the Emperor's son, [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian]], before his own death.\n\nLouis unwisely concentrated on seizing militarily the border territories, in particular the Duchy of Burgundy (a French fief). This naturally made negotiations for a marriage difficult. He later admitted to his councillor [[Philippe de Commynes]] that this was his greatest mistake. In the meantime the Habsburg Emperor moved faster and more purposefully and secured the match for his son Maximilian, with the aid of Mary's stepmother, Margaret.\n\nDue to this marriage, much of the Burgundian territories passed to the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. Throughout the early modern [[European Wars of Religion|Wars of Religion]] and [[End of World War II in Europe|down to 1945]], the border between the Holy Roman Empire and the [[kingdom of France]], and later between [[France]] and [[Germany]] (specifically, concerning [[Alsace]], [[Lorraine (region)|Lorraine]] and [[Flanders]]), became a matter of dispute.\n\n==In literature==\nHe is a main character in [[Sir Walter Scott]]'s 1823 novel ''[[Quentin Durward]]''.<ref>[http://www.walterscott.lib.ed.ac.uk/works/novels/durward.html]</ref> He is portrayed as intelligent, though brash.

His name at baptism was '''Charles Martin'''.\n\nHis main objective was to be crowned king by turning the growing [[Burgundian State]] into a territorially continuous kingdom. He declared himself and his lands independent, bought [[Alsace|Higher Alsace]] and conquered [[County of Zutphen|Zutphen]], [[Duchy of Guelders|Guelders]] and [[Duchy of Lorraine|Lorraine]], uniting at last Burgundian northern and southern possessions. It caused the enmity of several European powers and triggered the [[Burgundian Wars]].\n\nHis early death at the [[Battle of Nancy]] at the hands of [[Swiss mercenaries]] fighting for [[Ren\u00e9 II, Duke of Lorraine]] was of great consequence in European history. The Burgundian domains, long wedged between [[Kingdom of France|France]] and the [[Habsburg]] Empire, were divided, but the precise disposition of the vast and disparate territorial possessions involved was disputed among the European powers for centuries.\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early life===\n\nCharles the Bold was born in [[Dijon]], the son of [[Philip the Good]] and [[Isabella of Portugal (1397\u20131471)|Isabella of Portugal]]. Before the death of his father in 1467, he bore the title of [[Count of Charolais]]; afterwards, he assumed all of his father's titles, including that of \"Grand Duke of the West\". He was also made a [[Knight of the Golden Fleece]] just twenty days after his birth, invested by [[Charles I, Count of Nevers]], and the seigneur de [[Cro\u00ff]].\n\nCharles was brought up under the direction of Jean d'Auxy<ref>Steven J. Gunn and A. Janse, ''The Court As a Stage: England And the Low Countries in the Later Middle Ages'', (Boydell Press, 2006), 121.</ref> and early showed great application alike to academic studies and warlike exercises. His father's court was the most extravagant in Europe at the time, and a centre for the arts and commerce. While he was growing up, Charles witnessed his father's efforts to unite his far-flung and ethnically diverse dominions into a single state, and his own later efforts centered on continuing and securing his father's successes in this endeavor.\n\nIn 1440, at the age of seven, Charles was married to Catherine, daughter of King [[Charles VII of France]] and sister of the [[Dauphin of France|Dauphin]] (later King [[Louis XI of France|Louis XI]]). She was five years older than her husband, and she died in 1446 at the age of 18. They had no children.\n\n[[File:Rogier van der Weyden - Presentation Miniature, Chroniques de Hainaut KBR 9242.jpg|thumb|left|Charles as a boy stands next to his father, Philip the Good. [[Rogier van der Weyden]]'s frontispiece to the ''Chroniques de Hainaut'', c. 1447\u20138 ([[Royal Library of Belgium]])]]\n\nIn 1454, at the age of 21, Charles married a second time. He wanted to marry a daughter of his distant cousin [[Richard Plantagenet, 3rd Duke of York]] (a sister of Kings [[Edward IV of England|Edward IV]] and [[Richard III of England]]), but under terms of the [[Congress of Arras|Treaty of Arras]] of 1435, he was required to marry a French princess. His father chose [[Isabella of Bourbon]], who was three years younger than he was. Isabella was the daughter of Philip the Good's sister [[Agnes of Burgundy, Duchess of Bourbon|Agnes]] and a very distant cousin of Charles VII of France. Isabella died in 1465. Their daughter [[Mary of Burgundy]] was Charles' only surviving child; she inherited all the Burgundian domains before her marriage to [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian of Habsburg]], the son of [[Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor|Holy Roman Emperor Frederick III]].\n\nCharles was on friendly terms with his brother-in-law Louis, the Dauphin of France, who had been a refugee at the court of Burgundy from 1456 until he succeeded his father as king of France in 1461. But Louis began to pursue some of the same policies as his father, for example Louis's later repurchase of the towns on the [[Somme River]] that Louis's father had ceded in 1435 to Charles's father in the Treaty of Arras, which Charles viewed with chagrin. When his father's failing health enabled him to assume the reins of government (which Philip relinquished to him by an act of 12 April 1465), he initiated a policy of hostility toward Louis XI that led to the [[Burgundian Wars]], and he became one of the principal leaders of the [[League of the Public Weal]], an alliance of west European nobles opposed to policies of Louis XI that sought to centralize the royal authority within France.\n\nFor his third wife, Charles was offered the hand of Louis XI's daughter [[Anne of France|Anne]]. The wife he ultimately chose, however, was his second cousin [[Margaret of York]] (who was also a great-grandchild of [[John of Gaunt]]). Upon the death of his father in 1467, Charles was no longer bound by the terms of the Treaty of Arras, and he decided to ally himself with Burgundy's old ally England. Louis did his best to prevent or delay the marriage with Margaret (he even sent French ships to waylay her as she sailed to Sluys), but in the summer of 1468, it was celebrated sumptuously at [[Bruges]], and Charles was made a [[Knight of the Garter]]. The couple had no children, but Margaret devoted herself to her stepdaughter Mary. After Mary's death many years later, she kept Mary's two infant children as long as she was allowed.\n\n===Early battles===\nOn 12 April 1465, Philip relinquished control of the government of his domains to Charles, who spent the next summer prosecuting the [[War of the Public Weal]] against Louis XI. Charles was left master of the field at the [[Battle of Montlh\u00e9ry]] on 13 July 1465,<ref>Richard Vaughan, ''Charles the Bold'', (Boydell Press, 2002), 251.</ref> but this neither prevented the king from re-entering [[Paris, France|Paris]] nor did it assure Charles of a decisive victory. He succeeded, however, in forcing upon Louis the [[Treaty of Conflans]] of 4 October 1465, by which the king restored to him certain towns on the [[Somme (river)|Somme River]], the counties of [[Boulogne-sur-Mer|Boulogne]] and [[Gu\u00eenes]], and various other small territories. During the negotiations for the treaty, his wife Isabella died suddenly at Les Quesnoy on 25 September, making a political marriage suddenly possible. As part of the treaty, Louis promised him the hand of his infant daughter [[Anne of France|Anne]], with the territories of [[Champagne (province)|Champagne]] and [[Ponthieu]] as a [[dowry]], but no marriage ever took place. In the meanwhile, Charles obtained the surrender of [[Ponthieu]].\n\nCharles' concentration on the affairs of France was diverted by the [[Li\u00e8ge Wars|Revolt of Li\u00e8ge]] against his father and the bishop of Li\u00e8ge ([[Louis de Bourbon, Bishop of Li\u00e8ge|Louis of Bourbon]]) and a desire to punish the town of [[Dinant]] in the province of [[Namur (province)|Namur]]. During the wars of the summer of 1465, Dinant celebrated a false rumour that Charles had been defeated at Montlh\u00e9ry by burning him in [[effigy]] and chanting that he was the bastard child of his mother Isabella of Portugal and John of Heinsburg, the previous Bishop of Li\u00e8ge (d. 1455). On 25 August 1466, Charles marched into Dinant, determined to avenge this slur on the honour of his mother, and sacked the city, killing every man, woman and child within. After the death of Charles' father Philip the Good in 1467, the Bishopric of Li\u00e8ge renewed hostilities, but was defeated by Charles at the [[Battle of Brustem]]. Charles made a victorious entry into Li\u00e8ge, dismantled its walls and stripped the city of some of its privileges.\n\n===Treaty of P\u00e9ronne===\n[[File:Karte Haus Burgund 4 EN.png|thumb|Territories of the house of Valois-Burgundy during the reign of Charles the Bold.]]\n{{main|Treaty of P\u00e9ronne (1468)}}\n[[File:Emanuel van Meteren Historie ppn 051504510 MG 8647 Carolus Audax.tif|thumb|Engraving of Charles the Bold]]\n\nAlarmed by the early successes of the new Duke of Burgundy and anxious to settle various questions relating to the execution of the Treaty of Conflans, Louis XI requested a meeting with Charles and daringly placed himself in his hands in the town of [[P\u00e9ronne, Somme|P\u00e9ronne]] in [[Picardy]] in October 1468. In the course of the negotiations, the duke was informed of a fresh revolt of the [[Bishopric of Li\u00e8ge]] secretly fomented by Louis as part of the [[Li\u00e8ge Wars]]. After deliberating for four days on the best way to deal with his adversary, who had foolishly placed himself at his mercy, Charles decided to respect the promise he had given to guarantee Louis's safety and to negotiate with him. At the same time, he forced Louis to assist him in quelling the revolt in Li\u00e8ge. The town was captured and many inhabitants were massacred. Louis chose not to intervene on behalf of his former allies.\n\nAt the expiry of the one year's truce that followed the [[Treaty of P\u00e9ronne (1468)|Treaty of P\u00e9ronne]], the French king accused Charles of [[treason]], cited him to appear before the [[parlement]], and seized some of the towns on the Somme in 1471. The duke retaliated by invading France with a large army; he took possession of [[Nesle]] and massacred its inhabitants. He failed, however, in an attack on [[Beauvais]] and had to content himself with laying waste to the countryside as far as [[Rouen]]. He eventually withdrew without attaining any useful result.\n\n===Domestic policies===\nCharles pursued domestic policies that assisted the growth of his military establishment. To this end, he relinquished at least some of the extravagance that had characterized the court of Burgundy under his father, if not the magnificence of ceremonial events. From the beginning of his reign, he  employed himself in reorganizing his army and the administration of his territories. While retaining the principles of [[Feudalism|feudal recruiting]], he endeavored to establish a system of rigid discipline among his troops that was strengthened by the employment of foreign mercenaries, particularly [[Englishmen]] and [[Italians]], and the augmentation of his [[artillery]]. The economic power that Charles inherited from Philip led to an independent judicial system, a sophisticated administration, and the establishment of local estates.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Jones|first1=Colin|title=The Cambridge Illustrated History of France|year=1994|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0-521-43294-4|page=[https://archive.org/details/cambridgeillustr00jone_0/page/124 124]|edition=1st|url=https://archive.org/details/cambridgeillustr00jone_0|url-access=registration}}</ref>\n\n===Building a kingdom===\nCharles constantly sought to expand the territories under his control. In 1469, [[Sigismund, Archduke of Austria|Archduke Sigismund of Austria]] sold him the [[county of Ferrette]], the Landgraviate of [[Alsace]], and some other towns, reserving to himself the right to repurchase.\n\nIn 1472\u20131473, Charles bought the [[Reversion (law)|reversion]] of the Duchy of [[Guelders]] (i.e. the right to succeed to it) from its duke [[Arnold, Duke of Gelderland|Arnold]], whom he had supported against the rebellion of his son. Not content with being \"the Grand Duke of the West,\" he conceived the project of forming a kingdom of Burgundy or Arles with himself as independent [[sovereignty|sovereign]] and even persuaded the [[Holy Roman Emperor]] [[Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick III]] to assent to crown him a king at [[Trier]]. The ceremony, however, did not take place owing to the emperor's precipitate flight by night in September 1473, which was occasioned by his displeasure at the duke's ambitions.\n\nAt the close of 1473, the [[Burgundian State]] went from [[Charolais, France|Charolais]] in France to the edges of the [[Burgundian Netherlands|Netherlands]]. This made Charles the Bold one of the wealthiest and most powerful nobles in Europe. Indeed, his landholdings and revenue base rivalled those of many of the royal families.<ref>Great Events from History,''The Renaissance & Early Modern Era'', Vol. 1 (1454\u20131600), article author-Clare Callaghan, {{ISBN|1-58765-214-5}}</ref>\n\n===Downfall===\n{{unreferenced section|date=January 2016}}\n[[File:Peter Paul Rubens 144.jpg|upr .uk j. ight|thumb|Charles the Bold by [[Peter Paul Rubens]] (c. 1618).]]\n[[File:Eugene Burnand - Die Flucht Karls des K\u00fchnen.jpg|right|thumb|Charles' flight after the battle of Grandson, by [[Eug\u00e8ne Burnand]] (1894).]]\n[[File:MULO-Charles the Bold corpse.jpg|thumb| The corpse of Charles the Bold discovered after the Battle of Nancy, by [[Auguste Feyen-Perrin]] (1862).]]\nIn the year 1474, Charles began to involve himself in the series of political struggles that ultimately brought about his downfall. He first came into conflict with the [[Sigismund, Archduke of Austria|Archduke Sigismund of Austria]], to whom he refused to restore his possessions in Alsace for the stipulated sum. Then, he quarreled with the [[Growth of the Old Swiss Confederacy#The Burgundy Wars|Swiss]], who supported the free towns in the Upper Rhine in their [[Burgundian Wars#The conflict|revolt]] against the tyranny of the ducal governor [[Peter von Hagenbach]] (who was condemned by a special international tribunal and executed on 9 May 1474). Finally, he antagonized [[Ren\u00e9 II, Duke of Lorraine]], with whom he disputed the succession in the [[Duchy of Lorraine]], which bordered many of his territories. All of these enemies readily joined forces against their common adversary Charles.\n\nCharles suffered a first rebuff in endeavouring to protect his kinsman [[Ruprecht of the Palatinate (Archbishop of Cologne)|Ruprecht of the Palatinate]], [[Archbishop of Cologne]], against his rebel subjects. He spent ten months (July 1474 \u2013 June 1475) besieging the little town of [[Neuss]] on the [[Rhine]] (the [[Siege of Neuss]]), but was compelled by the approach of a powerful imperial army to raise the siege. Moreover, the expedition he had persuaded his brother-in-law Edward IV of England to undertake against Louis XI was stopped by the [[Treaty of Picquigny]] of 29 August 1475. He was more successful in Lorraine, where he seized [[Nancy, France|Nancy]] on 30 November 1475.\n\nFrom Nancy he marched against the Swiss. He saw fit to hang or drown the garrison of [[Grandson, Switzerland|Grandson]] in spite of its capitulation. Grandson was a possession of [[Jacques of Savoy, Count of Romont]], a close ally of Charles, that had been captured recently by the forces of the [[Old Swiss Confederacy|Swiss Confederacy]]. Some days later, on 2 March 1476, Charles was attacked outside the village of [[Concise]] by the confederate army in the [[Battle of Grandson]] and suffered a shameful defeat; he was compelled to flee with a handful of attendants and abandon his artillery along with an immense booty (including his silver bath).\n\nCharles succeeded in raising a fresh army of 30,000 men that he used to fight the [[Battle of Morat]] on 22 June 1476. He was again defeated by the Swiss army, which was assisted by the cavalry of the Duke of Lorraine. On this occasion, unlike the debacle at Grandson, little booty was lost, but Charles did lose about one third of his entire army. The defeated soldiers were pushed into the nearby lake, where they were drowned or shot at while trying to swim to safety on the opposite shore. On 6 October, Charles lost Nancy, which the Duke of Lorraine was able to recover.\n\n===Death at Nancy===\nMaking a last effort, Charles formed a new army and arrived in the dead of winter before the walls of Nancy. Having lost many of his troops through the severe cold, it was with only a few thousand men that he met the joint forces of the Lorrainers and the Swiss, who had come to the relief of the town. He himself perished in the fight, his naked and disfigured body being discovered some days afterward frozen in the nearby river. Charles' head had been cleft in two by a [[halberd]], lances were lodged in his stomach and loins, and his face had been so badly mutilated by wild animals that only his physician was able to identify him by his long fingernails and his old battle scars.\n\nCharles' battered body was initially buried in the ducal church in Nancy, by [[Ren\u00e9 II, Duke of Lorraine]].<ref>E.

The marriage was a happy one and produced his only offspring, [[Mary of Burgundy]] 13 February 1457.<ref name=\"Troyes106\" />\n* On 3 July 1468, Charles married Anne's sister, [[Margaret of York]] (1446\u20131503);<ref name=\"Troyes106\" /> her siblings also included [[Edward IV of England]], [[George, Duke of Clarence]], and [[Richard III of England]]. The marriage was solemnized at [[Damme]], near [[Bruges]], by the bishop of Salisbury.\n\nThe Burgundian possessions passed into the Habsburg empire on the marriage of his one child and heiress Mary to [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor]].\n\n==Byname==\nBurgundian chroniclers described the personality of the duke as austere, virtuous but without pity, pious and chaste, and with an exacerbated sense of honour. His contemporaries named him ''le Hardi'' or ''der K\u00fchne'' (\"the Bold\") or ''le Guerrier'' (\"the Warrior\") or ''le Terrible'' (\"the Terrible\"),<ref>a title derived from his savage behaviour against his enemies, and particularly from a war with France in late 1471.  Frustrated by the refusal of the French to engage in open battle, and angered by French attacks on his unprotected borders in Hainault and Flanders, Charles marched his army back from the Ile-de-France to Burgundian territory, burning more than 2000&nbsp;towns, villages and castles on his way\u2014Taylor, Aline S, ''Isabel of Burgundy'', pp. 212\u2013213</ref> among others, and the epithet that became his byname in history, ''le T\u00e9m\u00e9raire'' (\"the Reckless\"), is already found in Thomas Basin, bishop of Lisieux, who wrote around 1484.\nThese bynames, however, in the 15th century were used as qualifications of his character, but not yet in any systematic fashion, the duke being simply known as ''Charles de Bourgogne''.<ref>Anne Le Cam, ''Charles le T\u00e9m\u00e9raire, un homme et son r\u00eave'', \u00e9ditions In Fine, 1992, pp. 11, 87.</ref>\n\nThe process of the epithet ''le T\u00e9m\u00e9raire'' acquiring the nature of a byname was gradual. In the 17th century, the ''Grand Dictionnaire Historique'' of Louis Moreri mentions ''Charles de Bourgogne, surnomm\u00e9 le Guerrier, le Hardi ou le T\u00e9m\u00e9raire''.\nIn the 18th century,  Dom Plancher still mentions him as ''Charles le Hardi''.\nIn the 19th century, the byname of ''le T\u00e9m\u00e9raire'' became standard in France and Belgium.\n\n==Legacy==\n[[File:Map France 1477-en.svg|thumb|Map of France in 1477; the Burgundian territories are shown in orange]]\nCharles left his unmarried 19-year-old daughter [[Mary of Burgundy|Mary]] as his heir; clearly her marriage would have enormous implications for the political balance of Europe. Both Louis and the Emperor had unmarried eldest sons; Charles had made some movements towards arranging a marriage between Mary and the Emperor's son, [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian]], before his own death.\n\nLouis unwisely concentrated on seizing militarily the border territories, in particular the Duchy of Burgundy (a French fief). This naturally made negotiations for a marriage difficult. He later admitted to his councillor [[Philippe de Commynes]] that this was his greatest mistake. In the meantime the Habsburg Emperor moved faster and more purposefully and secured the match for his son Maximilian, with the aid of Mary's stepmother, Margaret.\n\nDue to this marriage, much of the Burgundian territories passed to the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. Throughout the early modern [[European Wars of Religion|Wars of Religion]] and [[End of World War II in Europe|down to 1945]], the border between the Holy Roman Empire and the [[kingdom of France]], and later between [[France]] and [[Germany]] (specifically, concerning [[Alsace]], [[Lorraine (region)|Lorraine]] and [[Flanders]]), became a matter of dispute.\n\n==In literature==\nHe is a main character in [[Sir Walter Scott]]'s 1823 novel ''[[Quentin Durward]]''.<ref>[http://www.walterscott.lib.ed.ac.uk/works/novels/durward.html]</ref> He is portrayed as intelligent, though brash.

The network consists of six [[owned-and-operated station|owned-and-operated]] (O&O) television stations located in the metropolitan areas of [[Toronto]], [[Montreal]], [[Winnipeg]], [[Calgary]], [[Edmonton]], and [[Vancouver]], a cable-only service that serves the province of [[Saskatchewan]], and three independently owned affiliates serving smaller cities in [[Alberta]] and [[British Columbia]].\n\nThe Citytv brand's name originates from its flagship station, [[CITY-DT|CITY-TV]] in [[Toronto]], a station which became known for an intensely local format based on newscasts aimed at younger viewers, nightly movies, and music and cultural programming. The Citytv brand first expanded with [[CHUM Limited]]'s acquisition of former [[Global Television Network|Global]] O&O [[CKVU-DT|CKVU-TV]] in [[Vancouver]], followed by its purchase of [[Craig Media]]'s stations and the re-branding of its [[A-Channel (Craig Media)|A-Channel]] [[television system|system]] in [[Central Canada]] as Citytv in August 2005. CHUM Limited was acquired by CTVglobemedia (now [[Bell Media]]) in 2007; to comply with [[Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission]] (CRTC) ownership limits, the Citytv stations were sold to Rogers. The network grew through further affiliations with three [[Jim Pattison Group]]-owned stations, along with Rogers' acquisition of the cable-only [[Citytv Saskatchewan|Saskatchewan Communications Network]] and [[Montreal]]'s [[CJNT-DT]].\n\nWhile patterned after the original station in Toronto, since the 2000s, and particularly since its acquisition by Rogers, Citytv has moved towards a series-based primetime schedule much like its competitors, albeit one still focused on younger demographics.\n\n==History==\n{{See also|2007 Canada broadcast TV realignment}}\nThe licence of the original Citytv station, granted the [[callsign]] of [[CITY-DT|CITY-TV]] by the CRTC, was awarded in Toronto on November 25, 1971,<ref>{{cite web |title=CITY-DT |url=http://www.broadcasting-history.ca/listing_and_histories/television/city-dt |website=Canadian Broadcasting Foundation |accessdate=28 September 2018}}</ref> and began broadcasting for the first time using the \"Citytv\" brand on September 28, 1972, under the ownership of Channel Seventy-Nine Ltd. with its studios located at 99 Queen Street East near Church Street. The station was in debt by 1975. Multiple Access Ltd. (then-owners of [[CFCF-DT|CFCF]] in [[Montreal]]) purchased a 45% interest in the station, and sold its stake to [[CHUM Limited]] three years later. CHUM Limited acquired the station outright in 1981. Broadcasting on [[Ultra high frequency|UHF]] channel 79 during its first decade, the station moved to channel 57 in 1983, until moving to channel 44 with the digital transition (though mapping as [[virtual channel]] 57.1). In 1987, the station moved its headquarters to [[299 Queen Street West]], formerly known as the [[Ryerson Press]] Building (then known as the CHUM-City Building); one of the most recognizable landmarks in the city. On September 8, 2009, CITY moved to its current location at [[Yonge-Dundas Square]] at [[33 Dundas Street East]].<ref name=dundas>{{cite web|url=http://www.citytv.com/toronto/citynews/news/local/article/56287--citytv-on-the-move-pt-1|title=Citytv On The Move Pt. 1|publisher=Citytv|date=2009-08-31|accessdate=2009-09-09|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090904120910/http://www.citytv.com/toronto/citynews/news/local/article/56287--citytv-on-the-move-pt-1|archive-date=2009-09-04|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nCitytv gained a second station in Vancouver when CHUM bought [[CKVU-DT|CKVU]] from [[Canwest|Canwest Global Communications]] in 2001. The station became known as \"Citytv Vancouver\" on July 22, 2002. Prior to CHUM's acquisition of CKVU, some Citytv programming was syndicated to [[KVOS-TV|KVOS]] in nearby [[Bellingham, Washington]].\n\n[[File:City TV Building at The Forks, in Winnipeg Manitoba.JPG|thumb|upright|Citytv Building at [[The Forks, Winnipeg|The Forks]], in [[Winnipeg]], [[Manitoba]].]]\nIn 2004, CHUM bought [[Craig Media]], parent of the [[A-Channel (Craig Media)|A-Channel]] system in [[Manitoba]] and [[Alberta]].

The Edmonton and Calgary stations also began broadcasting a daily 30-minute magazine show, ''Your City'', instead of a full-fledged newscast. The Vancouver news operation, which had operated for 30 years under various owners and station identities, was not maintained aside from ''[[Breakfast Television]]''. In the same month, Citytv Toronto became the first television station in Canada to begin broadcasting its local newscasts in [[High-definition video|high definition]].\n\nThe following year on June 8, the CRTC approved the CTV takeover of CHUM. However, the CRTC made the deal conditional on CTV divesting itself of Citytv, because there were already CTV [[owned-and-operated station]]s serving the same cities ([[CFTO-DT|CFTO]] Toronto, [[CIVT-DT|CIVT]] Vancouver, [[CFCN-DT|CFCN]] Calgary, [[CFRN-DT|CFRN]] Edmonton, and [[CKY-DT|CKY]] Winnipeg). Without the divestment, CTV would have exceeded the CRTC's [[concentration of media ownership]] limits. CTV announced on June 11, 2007, that it would retain the A-Channel stations, and sell the Citytv stations to [[Rogers Communications]] for $375 million.<ref>{{cite news | url = https://www.thestar.com/Business/article/224297 | title = Rogers buys Citytv stations | language = | accessdate = 2007-06-12 | work=The Star| location=Toronto | first=Jim | last=Byers | date=June 12, 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://micro.newswire.ca/release.cgi?rkey=1506113399&view=16336-0&Start=0 | title = Rogers Communications Inc, Official News Release: Rogers buys Citytv Stations | accessdate = 2007-08-18 | year = 2007 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://archive.is/20130115104758/http://micro.newswire.ca/release.cgi?rkey=1506113399&view=16336-0&Start=0 | archivedate = 2013-01-15 }}</ref> The transaction was approved by the CRTC on September 28 and was completed on October 31, 2007.\n\n[[File:City logo 2012.svg|right|150px|thumb|Logo used from 2012-2018 when branded as \"City\".]] \n\nOn December 6, 2010, ''CityNews Tonight'' Toronto anchor and continuity announcer [[Mark Dailey]] died after a long battle with cancer.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.citytv.com/toronto/citynews/news/local/article/102653--a-legend-lost-toronto-mourns-the-death-of-mark-dailey |title=A Legend Lost: Toronto Mourns The Death Of Mark Dailey |access-date=2010-12-08 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101209111314/http://www.citytv.com/toronto/citynews/news/local/article/102653--a-legend-lost-toronto-mourns-the-death-of-mark-dailey |archive-date=2010-12-09 |url-status=dead}}</ref> The Citytv system began to phase in a modified branding in October 2012, with a new logo consisting only of the name \"City\", and some promotions using the verbal branding \"City Television\" (later also switched to simply \"City\") instead of Citytv.

There is no news desk (anchors read the news standing up, or on stools), and cameras are sometimes hand-held. Citytv also pioneered the concept of videojournalism, where reporters often carry their own camera report and videotape their own stories. Citytv calls its videojournalists \"videographers\", but unlike many stations in American television markets that try to conceal the fact that reporters are so-called \"one-man bands\", Citytv embraced the use of video journalism by highlighting the use of technology; Citytv videographers often carry a second home video camera to record images of them videotaping on the scene. The low-grade video is then incorporated into the story to show viewers how the story was recorded.\n\nAt one time, Citytv's Toronto [[Flagship (broadcasting)|flagship]] CITY-TV produced more local programs than any other television station in Canada, and more local programming than any other station in North America other than [[Boston]]'s [[WCVB-TV]]. Citytv produced shows such as ''[[Speakers' Corner (television series)|Speakers' Corner]]'', ''[[CityLine]]'' and was the original home of ''[[FashionTelevision]]'', ''[[SexTV]]'' and ''[[MediaTelevision]]''. Many of these series were not exclusively focused on Toronto \u2013 ''FT'', for instance, consisted largely of foreign [[Runway (fashion)|runway]] footage \u2013 and are easily syndicated to other outlets. The latter three shows are now owned by [[CTVglobemedia]] as a result of its takeover of CHUM and subsequent divestiture of the Citytv stations.\n\n[[Image:Jill Belland 2a.jpg|right|thumb|[[Jill Belland]] covering the 2007 [[Calgary International Film Festival]] for Citytv.]]\nCITY prominently broadcast feature films during primetime, in late night and on weekends as part of the ''Great Movies'' block; as Citytv transitioned to a primetime lineup consisting of mainly domestic and American series during the 2000s, ''Great Movies'' was scaled back, then replaced in 2008 by reruns, reality shows and infomercials.\n\nThe station attracted attention and controversy by airing ''[[The Baby Blue Movie]]'', a [[softcore pornography]] film showcase on Friday nights after midnight. Although this programming block was discontinued in the 1980s, it was reinstated on [[CITY-TV|CITY]] and [[CKVU-TV|CKVU]] throughout most of the 2000s,<ref>{{Cite news|url = https://www.thestar.com/entertainment/television/2013/01/10/citytv_quietly_changes_its_name_to_city.html|title = Citytv quietly changes its name to City|last = Teotonio|first = Isabel|date = Jan 10, 2013|work = |accessdate = }}</ref> until its ownership change to Rogers Communications. This, along with the 'hide away' place on the UHF dial formed the basis of fictional station \"CIVIC TV\" (Channel 83, Cable 12) in [[David Cronenberg]]'s ''[[Videodrome]]'', which is set in Toronto.\n\nCitytv was one of the first television stations in Canada to implement a diversity policy in hiring its on-air staff, actively seeking out [[people of colour]], people with disabilities, and other minority groups to work as on-air journalists. Znaimer described the policy as wanting the station to \"look like Toronto\".\n\nBeginning in 1983, Citytv began to produce a [[New Year's Eve]] special live from [[Nathan Phillips Square]] in [[Downtown Toronto]]. Most recently known as the ''City New Year's Eve Bash'', the yearly concert special expanded to include a second event in Calgary, Alberta for its 2012\u201313 edition. In 2013\u201314, Citytv began simulcasting ABC's ''[[Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve]]'' instead of airing its own full special, though it continued to sponsor (and air some coverage of) the New Year's event in Toronto.<ref name=city-nyrecanada>{{cite web|title=Skating & food trucks on offer at City's New Year's Eve party|url=http://www.citynews.ca/2013/12/12/skating-food-trucks-on-offer-at-citys-new-years-eve-party/|work=CityNews Toronto|publisher=[[Rogers Media]]|accessdate=16 December 2013}}</ref><ref name=torsun-torontonye>{{cite web|title=No politicians on stage for Nathan Phillips Square NYE bash|url=http://www.torontosun.com/2013/12/12/no-politicians-on-stage-for-nathan-phillips-square-nye-bash|work=Toronto Sun|accessdate=16 December 2013}}</ref>\n\n===News===\n{{Main|CityNews}}\n[[File:CITY-TV OMNI building.JPG|thumb|The CITY/[[Omni Television|OMNI]] building<br>[[33 Dundas Street East]], Toronto]]\nCitytv Toronto's ''[[CityNews]]'', which used to be known as ''CityPulse'', had developed a large following since its debut in 1977. Other stations around the world have imitated its format to varying degrees of success. However, Citytv itself was unsuccessful in expanding its audience to other Canadian markets, as evidenced by the eventual cancellation of the other stations' traditional newscasts. Flagship station CITY-DT, along with Jim Pattison Group-owned affiliates [[CFJC-TV]], [[CKPG-TV]] and [[CHAT-TV]] are the only Citytv stations producing midday or evening newscasts. The Pattison stations use their individual callsigns, instead of branding under the Citytv name and do not use the ''CityNews'' title for their weekday newscasts. Four of City's five other owned-and-operated broadcast stations (CKVU-DT, [[CKAL-DT]], [[CKEM-DT]] and [[CHMI-DT]]) only produce localized versions of the morning program franchise ''[[Breakfast Television]]''. Citytv Saskatchewan, meanwhile, does not carry any local programming, and would be unable to broadcast ''Breakfast Television'' due to its mandate of airing educational programming in the morning and daytime hours.\n\nDue to the ongoing structural problems facing the conventional television industry in Canada and the [[2007\u20132012 global financial crisis|global economic crisis]], [[Rogers Media]] announced cost-cutting measures at the Citytv stations on January 19, 2010, which included massive layoffs and the cancellation of the following newscasts:\n* ''CityNews at Noon'' in Calgary, Edmonton and Toronto\n* ''Lunch Television'' in Vancouver\n* ''Your City'' in Calgary and Edmonton, which was an evening replacement for previous CityNews programming that was cancelled in 2006.\n* The satirical news program ''The CityNews List'' in Vancouver\n* ''CityOnline'', ''CityNews at Five'' and all weekend news programming in Toronto (the latter two were restored in 2011)\n* City's national and international newscast, ''CityNews International''\n\nCITY-DT used to operate [[CP24]], a cable [[news channel]] covering the [[Greater Toronto Area]]. During CTVglobemedia's purchase of CHUM Limited, the company chose to retain CP24, and the channel was re-aligned with [[CFTO]] (CTV). As a replacement, Rogers received approval for, and launched, [[CityNews Channel]] in October 2011. The network was modelled on Rogers-owned radio station [[CFTR (AM)|CFTR 680]], and featured news, weather, traffic reports, and other content drawing from the resources of Rogers properties such as ''[[Maclean's]]'' and [[Sportsnet]]. On May 30, 2013, as part of budget cuts, Rogers announced that the network would be shut down.<ref name=torstar-citynewschannelgone>{{cite web|title=CityNews channel shut down by Rogers|url=https://www.thestar.com/business/2013/05/30/citynews_channel_shut_down_by_rogers.html|website=Toronto Star|accessdate=11 July 2015}}</ref><ref name=gandm-citynewschannel>{{cite news|title=Rogers dumps CityNews channel after 20 months|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/rogers-dumps-citynews-channel-after-20-months/article12259496/|accessdate=11 July 2015|work=The Globe and Mail}}</ref>\n\nCitytv continued to produce ''Breakfast Television'' for all markets, and 6:00&nbsp;p.m. and late-night ''CityNews Tonight'' in Toronto only (the evening newscasts in Toronto excluded weekend broadcasts until March 2011; the 5 p.m. newscast, meanwhile, would return in September 2011).

Similarly, CKVU Vancouver carried two regional [[Vancouver Canucks]] broadcasts during the 2009-10 season, again due to programming conflicts on Sportsnet Pacific.

Both ATV and ASN were acquired by Baton Broadcasting (now Bell Media) in 1997; ASN continued to air much of the Citytv schedule until it became part of the A (now [[CTV Two]]) television system in 2008. This means that Atlantic Canada is now the largest gap in City's local coverage area, and there are few remaining realistic options for Rogers to purchase or affiliate with existing stations in the region. This had led Rogers to attempt, unsuccessfully, to request [[simultaneous substitution]] privileges for Citytv Toronto on its cable systems in [[New Brunswick]] and [[Newfoundland and Labrador]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://crtc.gc.ca/eng/archive/2012/2012-551.htm|title=Broadcasting Decision CRTC 2012-551|author=[[Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission]]|date=2012-10-10|accessdate=2012-12-21}}</ref> Prior to the CRTC's decision to refuse the request, Rogers had hinted that a similar agreement had been tentatively reached with [[EastLink (company)|EastLink]], the main cable provider in [[Nova Scotia]] and [[Prince Edward Island]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://business.financialpost.com/2012/05/29/in-bid-to-attract-canadas-big-advertisers-rogers-focuses-on-expanding-tv-distribution/|title=In bid to attract Canada's big advertisers, Rogers focuses on expanding TV distribution|first=Jamie|last=Sturgeon|work=[[National Post]]|date=2012-05-29|accessdate=2012-12-21}}</ref>\n\nOther such gaps include parts of the B.C. interior and Northern Ontario. However, like most Canadian networks, Citytv stations are generally available as distant signals on most cable and satellite providers nationwide.\n\nIn the past, local rights to individual Citytv programs were sold to stations outside of the Toronto station's coverage area. In Vancouver, programs were split between [[KVOS-TV|KVOS]] in [[Bellingham, Washington]], which is close to Vancouver, and CTV-owned [[CIVT-TV|CIVT]], during the 1990s and early 2000s when Citytv did not have a station in Vancouver; [[CHAN-DT|CHAN]], then a CTV affiliate, also aired some Citytv programs, such as ''CityLine''. The [[Western International Communications|WIC]] stations in Alberta (including [[CITV-TV|CITV]] and [[CICT-TV|CICT]]) bought provincial rights to some Citytv programs prior to the launch of CKAL and CKEM in 1997.\n\n===Affiliates and international franchises===\nThe Citytv brand has been licensed to local television stations in [[Bogot\u00e1]], [[Colombia]] and formerly in [[Barcelona]], [[Spain]].

The network consists of six [[owned-and-operated station|owned-and-operated]] (O&O) television stations located in the metropolitan areas of [[Toronto]], [[Montreal]], [[Winnipeg]], [[Calgary]], [[Edmonton]], and [[Vancouver]], a cable-only service that serves the province of [[Saskatchewan]], and three independently owned affiliates serving smaller cities in [[Alberta]] and [[British Columbia]].\n\nThe Citytv brand's name originates from its flagship station, [[CITY-DT|CITY-TV]] in [[Toronto]], a station which became known for an intensely local format based on newscasts aimed at younger viewers, nightly movies, and music and cultural programming. The Citytv brand first expanded with [[CHUM Limited]]'s acquisition of former [[Global Television Network|Global]] O&O [[CKVU-DT|CKVU-TV]] in [[Vancouver]], followed by its purchase of [[Craig Media]]'s stations and the re-branding of its [[A-Channel (Craig Media)|A-Channel]] [[television system|system]] in [[Central Canada]] as Citytv in August 2005. CHUM Limited was acquired by CTVglobemedia (now [[Bell Media]]) in 2007; to comply with [[Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission]] (CRTC) ownership limits, the Citytv stations were sold to Rogers. The network grew through further affiliations with three [[Jim Pattison Group]]-owned stations, along with Rogers' acquisition of the cable-only [[Citytv Saskatchewan|Saskatchewan Communications Network]] and [[Montreal]]'s [[CJNT-DT]].\n\nWhile patterned after the original station in Toronto, since the 2000s, and particularly since its acquisition by Rogers, Citytv has moved towards a series-based primetime schedule much like its competitors, albeit one still focused on younger demographics.\n\n==History==\n{{See also|2007 Canada broadcast TV realignment}}\nThe licence of the original Citytv station, granted the [[callsign]] of [[CITY-DT|CITY-TV]] by the CRTC, was awarded in Toronto on November 25, 1971,<ref>{{cite web |title=CITY-DT |url=http://www.broadcasting-history.ca/listing_and_histories/television/city-dt |website=Canadian Broadcasting Foundation |accessdate=28 September 2018}}</ref> and began broadcasting for the first time using the \"Citytv\" brand on September 28, 1972, under the ownership of Channel Seventy-Nine Ltd. with its studios located at 99 Queen Street East near Church Street. The station was in debt by 1975. Multiple Access Ltd. (then-owners of [[CFCF-DT|CFCF]] in [[Montreal]]) purchased a 45% interest in the station, and sold its stake to [[CHUM Limited]] three years later. CHUM Limited acquired the station outright in 1981. Broadcasting on [[Ultra high frequency|UHF]] channel 79 during its first decade, the station moved to channel 57 in 1983, until moving to channel 44 with the digital transition (though mapping as [[virtual channel]] 57.1). In 1987, the station moved its headquarters to [[299 Queen Street West]], formerly known as the [[Ryerson Press]] Building (then known as the CHUM-City Building); one of the most recognizable landmarks in the city. On September 8, 2009, CITY moved to its current location at [[Yonge-Dundas Square]] at [[33 Dundas Street East]].<ref name=dundas>{{cite web|url=http://www.citytv.com/toronto/citynews/news/local/article/56287--citytv-on-the-move-pt-1|title=Citytv On The Move Pt. 1|publisher=Citytv|date=2009-08-31|accessdate=2009-09-09|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090904120910/http://www.citytv.com/toronto/citynews/news/local/article/56287--citytv-on-the-move-pt-1|archive-date=2009-09-04|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nCitytv gained a second station in Vancouver when CHUM bought [[CKVU-DT|CKVU]] from [[Canwest|Canwest Global Communications]] in 2001. The station became known as \"Citytv Vancouver\" on July 22, 2002. Prior to CHUM's acquisition of CKVU, some Citytv programming was syndicated to [[KVOS-TV|KVOS]] in nearby [[Bellingham, Washington]].\n\n[[File:City TV Building at The Forks, in Winnipeg Manitoba.JPG|thumb|upright|Citytv Building at [[The Forks, Winnipeg|The Forks]], in [[Winnipeg]], [[Manitoba]].]]\nIn 2004, CHUM bought [[Craig Media]], parent of the [[A-Channel (Craig Media)|A-Channel]] system in [[Manitoba]] and [[Alberta]]. The Craig-owned A-Channel stations were relaunched as Citytv on August 2, 2005; the same date that CHUM's NewNet stations, including [[CKVR-DT|CKVR]], [[CHWI-DT|CHWI]] and [[CFPL-DT|CFPL]], were rebranded under the A-Channel banner.\n\n[[Image:citytv-nissan6839.JPG|thumb|Citytv news vehicle in Edmonton]]\n[[CHUM Limited]] announced plans to sell its broadcasting assets to [[CTV Television Network|CTV]] parent [[Bell Media|CTVglobemedia]] on July 12, 2006. CTVgm intended to retain CHUM's Citytv system while divesting CHUM's [[CTV Two|A-Channel]] stations and Alberta cable channel [[CTV Two Alberta|Access]] to get the CRTC to approve the acquisition.<ref name=takeover>{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/story/2006/07/12/chum-bell.html|title=Bell Globemedia makes $1.7B bid for CHUM|work=[[CBC News]]|date=2006-07-12|accessdate=2006-07-12}}</ref> On the same day that the takeover was announced, Citytv cancelled its supper-hour, late-night and weekend newscasts at its local Vancouver, Edmonton, Calgary and Winnipeg stations, laying off hundreds of news department staff.\n\nIn October 2006, Citytv launched a daily national newscast, ''[[CityNews International]]'', which was produced in Toronto for broadcast on the western Canadian stations and on CHUM's Toronto news channel [[CP24]]. The Edmonton and Calgary stations also began broadcasting a daily 30-minute magazine show, ''Your City'', instead of a full-fledged newscast. The Vancouver news operation, which had operated for 30 years under various owners and station identities, was not maintained aside from ''[[Breakfast Television]]''. In the same month, Citytv Toronto became the first television station in Canada to begin broadcasting its local newscasts in [[High-definition video|high definition]].\n\nThe following year on June 8, the CRTC approved the CTV takeover of CHUM. However, the CRTC made the deal conditional on CTV divesting itself of Citytv, because there were already CTV [[owned-and-operated station]]s serving the same cities ([[CFTO-DT|CFTO]] Toronto, [[CIVT-DT|CIVT]] Vancouver, [[CFCN-DT|CFCN]] Calgary, [[CFRN-DT|CFRN]] Edmonton, and [[CKY-DT|CKY]] Winnipeg).

There is no news desk (anchors read the news standing up, or on stools), and cameras are sometimes hand-held. Citytv also pioneered the concept of videojournalism, where reporters often carry their own camera report and videotape their own stories. Citytv calls its videojournalists \"videographers\", but unlike many stations in American television markets that try to conceal the fact that reporters are so-called \"one-man bands\", Citytv embraced the use of video journalism by highlighting the use of technology; Citytv videographers often carry a second home video camera to record images of them videotaping on the scene. The low-grade video is then incorporated into the story to show viewers how the story was recorded.\n\nAt one time, Citytv's Toronto [[Flagship (broadcasting)|flagship]] CITY-TV produced more local programs than any other television station in Canada, and more local programming than any other station in North America other than [[Boston]]'s [[WCVB-TV]]. Citytv produced shows such as ''[[Speakers' Corner (television series)|Speakers' Corner]]'', ''[[CityLine]]'' and was the original home of ''[[FashionTelevision]]'', ''[[SexTV]]'' and ''[[MediaTelevision]]''. Many of these series were not exclusively focused on Toronto \u2013 ''FT'', for instance, consisted largely of foreign [[Runway (fashion)|runway]] footage \u2013 and are easily syndicated to other outlets. The latter three shows are now owned by [[CTVglobemedia]] as a result of its takeover of CHUM and subsequent divestiture of the Citytv stations.\n\n[[Image:Jill Belland 2a.jpg|right|thumb|[[Jill Belland]] covering the 2007 [[Calgary International Film Festival]] for Citytv.]]\nCITY prominently broadcast feature films during primetime, in late night and on weekends as part of the ''Great Movies'' block; as Citytv transitioned to a primetime lineup consisting of mainly domestic and American series during the 2000s, ''Great Movies'' was scaled back, then replaced in 2008 by reruns, reality shows and infomercials.\n\nThe station attracted attention and controversy by airing ''[[The Baby Blue Movie]]'', a [[softcore pornography]] film showcase on Friday nights after midnight. Although this programming block was discontinued in the 1980s, it was reinstated on [[CITY-TV|CITY]] and [[CKVU-TV|CKVU]] throughout most of the 2000s,<ref>{{Cite news|url = https://www.thestar.com/entertainment/television/2013/01/10/citytv_quietly_changes_its_name_to_city.html|title = Citytv quietly changes its name to City|last = Teotonio|first = Isabel|date = Jan 10, 2013|work = |accessdate = }}</ref> until its ownership change to Rogers Communications. This, along with the 'hide away' place on the UHF dial formed the basis of fictional station \"CIVIC TV\" (Channel 83, Cable 12) in [[David Cronenberg]]'s ''[[Videodrome]]'', which is set in Toronto.\n\nCitytv was one of the first television stations in Canada to implement a diversity policy in hiring its on-air staff, actively seeking out [[people of colour]], people with disabilities, and other minority groups to work as on-air journalists. Znaimer described the policy as wanting the station to \"look like Toronto\".\n\nBeginning in 1983, Citytv began to produce a [[New Year's Eve]] special live from [[Nathan Phillips Square]] in [[Downtown Toronto]]. Most recently known as the ''City New Year's Eve Bash'', the yearly concert special expanded to include a second event in Calgary, Alberta for its 2012\u201313 edition. In 2013\u201314, Citytv began simulcasting ABC's ''[[Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve]]'' instead of airing its own full special, though it continued to sponsor (and air some coverage of) the New Year's event in Toronto.<ref name=city-nyrecanada>{{cite web|title=Skating & food trucks on offer at City's New Year's Eve party|url=http://www.citynews.ca/2013/12/12/skating-food-trucks-on-offer-at-citys-new-years-eve-party/|work=CityNews Toronto|publisher=[[Rogers Media]]|accessdate=16 December 2013}}</ref><ref name=torsun-torontonye>{{cite web|title=No politicians on stage for Nathan Phillips Square NYE bash|url=http://www.torontosun.com/2013/12/12/no-politicians-on-stage-for-nathan-phillips-square-nye-bash|work=Toronto Sun|accessdate=16 December 2013}}</ref>\n\n===News===\n{{Main|CityNews}}\n[[File:CITY-TV OMNI building.JPG|thumb|The CITY/[[Omni Television|OMNI]] building<br>[[33 Dundas Street East]], Toronto]]\nCitytv Toronto's ''[[CityNews]]'', which used to be known as ''CityPulse'', had developed a large following since its debut in 1977. Other stations around the world have imitated its format to varying degrees of success. However, Citytv itself was unsuccessful in expanding its audience to other Canadian markets, as evidenced by the eventual cancellation of the other stations' traditional newscasts. Flagship station CITY-DT, along with Jim Pattison Group-owned affiliates [[CFJC-TV]], [[CKPG-TV]] and [[CHAT-TV]] are the only Citytv stations producing midday or evening newscasts. The Pattison stations use their individual callsigns, instead of branding under the Citytv name and do not use the ''CityNews'' title for their weekday newscasts. Four of City's five other owned-and-operated broadcast stations (CKVU-DT, [[CKAL-DT]], [[CKEM-DT]] and [[CHMI-DT]]) only produce localized versions of the morning program franchise ''[[Breakfast Television]]''. Citytv Saskatchewan, meanwhile, does not carry any local programming, and would be unable to broadcast ''Breakfast Television'' due to its mandate of airing educational programming in the morning and daytime hours.\n\nDue to the ongoing structural problems facing the conventional television industry in Canada and the [[2007\u20132012 global financial crisis|global economic crisis]], [[Rogers Media]] announced cost-cutting measures at the Citytv stations on January 19, 2010, which included massive layoffs and the cancellation of the following newscasts:\n* ''CityNews at Noon'' in Calgary, Edmonton and Toronto\n* ''Lunch Television'' in Vancouver\n* ''Your City'' in Calgary and Edmonton, which was an evening replacement for previous CityNews programming that was cancelled in 2006.\n* The satirical news program ''The CityNews List'' in Vancouver\n* ''CityOnline'', ''CityNews at Five'' and all weekend news programming in Toronto (the latter two were restored in 2011)\n* City's national and international newscast, ''CityNews International''\n\nCITY-DT used to operate [[CP24]], a cable [[news channel]] covering the [[Greater Toronto Area]]. During CTVglobemedia's purchase of CHUM Limited, the company chose to retain CP24, and the channel was re-aligned with [[CFTO]] (CTV). As a replacement, Rogers received approval for, and launched, [[CityNews Channel]] in October 2011. The network was modelled on Rogers-owned radio station [[CFTR (AM)|CFTR 680]], and featured news, weather, traffic reports, and other content drawing from the resources of Rogers properties such as ''[[Maclean's]]'' and [[Sportsnet]]. On May 30, 2013, as part of budget cuts, Rogers announced that the network would be shut down.<ref name=torstar-citynewschannelgone>{{cite web|title=CityNews channel shut down by Rogers|url=https://www.thestar.com/business/2013/05/30/citynews_channel_shut_down_by_rogers.html|website=Toronto Star|accessdate=11 July 2015}}</ref><ref name=gandm-citynewschannel>{{cite news|title=Rogers dumps CityNews channel after 20 months|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/rogers-dumps-citynews-channel-after-20-months/article12259496/|accessdate=11 July 2015|work=The Globe and Mail}}</ref>\n\nCitytv continued to produce ''Breakfast Television'' for all markets, and 6:00&nbsp;p.m. and late-night ''CityNews Tonight'' in Toronto only (the evening newscasts in Toronto excluded weekend broadcasts until March 2011; the 5 p.m. newscast, meanwhile, would return in September 2011).

Forward time travel, outside the usual sense of [[time perception|the perception of time]], is an extensively observed phenomenon and well-understood within the framework of [[special relativity]] and [[general relativity]]. However, making one body advance or delay more than a few milliseconds compared to another body is not feasible with current technology. As for backward time travel, it is possible to find [[Exact solutions in general relativity|solutions in general relativity]] that allow for it, such as a rotating [[black hole]].

Such a solution was first proposed by [[Kurt G\u00f6del]], a solution known as the [[G\u00f6del metric]], but his (and others') solution requires the universe to have physical characteristics that it does not appear to have,<ref name=\"Thorne1994\"/>{{rp|499}} such as [[Mach's principle|rotation]] and lack of [[Hubble expansion]].

Alternatively, another way is to take one entrance of the wormhole and move it to within the gravitational field of an object that has higher gravity than the other entrance, and then return it to a position near the other entrance. For both these methods, [[time dilation]] causes the end of the wormhole that has been moved to have aged less, or become \"younger\", than the stationary end as seen by an external observer; however, time connects differently ''through'' the wormhole than ''outside'' it, so that [[Synchronization|synchronized]] clocks at either end of the wormhole will always remain synchronized as seen by an observer passing through the wormhole, no matter how the two ends move around.<ref name=\"Thorne1994\" />{{rp|502}} This means that an observer entering the \"younger\" end would exit the \"older\" end at a time when it was the same age as the \"younger\" end, effectively going back in time as seen by an observer from the outside. One significant limitation of such a time machine is that it is only possible to go as far back in time as the initial creation of the machine;<ref name=\"Thorne1994\" />{{rp|503}} in essence, it is more of a path through time than it is a device that itself moves through time, and it would not allow the technology itself to be moved backward in time.\n\nAccording to current theories on the nature of wormholes, construction of a traversable wormhole would require the existence of a substance with negative energy, often referred to as \"[[exotic matter]]\".

This is possible due to the [[relativity of simultaneity]]. However, the symmetry is broken if one clock accelerates, allowing for less proper time to pass for one clock than the other. The [[twin paradox]] describes this: one twin remains on Earth, while the other undergoes acceleration to [[relativistic speed]] as they travel into space, turn around, and travel back to Earth; the traveling twin ages less than the twin who stayed on Earth, because of the time dilation experienced during their acceleration. General relativity treats the effects of acceleration and the effects of gravity as [[Equivalence principle|equivalent]], and shows that time dilation also occurs in [[gravity well]]s, with a clock deeper in the well ticking more slowly; this effect is taken into account when calibrating the clocks on the satellites of the [[Global Positioning System]], and it could lead to significant differences in rates of aging for observers at different distances from a large gravity well such as a [[black hole]].<ref name=\"Gott\"/>{{rp|33\u2013130}}\n\nA time machine that utilizes this principle might be, for instance, a spherical shell with a diameter of five meters and the [[Jupiter mass|mass of Jupiter]].

Alternatively, another way is to take one entrance of the wormhole and move it to within the gravitational field of an object that has higher gravity than the other entrance, and then return it to a position near the other entrance. For both these methods, [[time dilation]] causes the end of the wormhole that has been moved to have aged less, or become \"younger\", than the stationary end as seen by an external observer; however, time connects differently ''through'' the wormhole than ''outside'' it, so that [[Synchronization|synchronized]] clocks at either end of the wormhole will always remain synchronized as seen by an observer passing through the wormhole, no matter how the two ends move around.<ref name=\"Thorne1994\" />{{rp|502}} This means that an observer entering the \"younger\" end would exit the \"older\" end at a time when it was the same age as the \"younger\" end, effectively going back in time as seen by an observer from the outside.

Solutions such as Tipler's assume cylinders of infinite length, which are easier to analyze mathematically, and although Tipler suggested that a finite cylinder might produce closed timelike curves if the rotation rate were fast enough,<ref name=\"Earman\" />{{rp|169}} he did not prove this. But Hawking points out that because of his theorem, \"it can't be done with positive energy density everywhere!

Ross uses [[Somewhere in Time (film)|\"Somewhere in Time\"]] as an example of such an ontological paradox, where a watch is given to a person, and 60 years later the same watch is brought back in time and given to the same character. Ross states that [[entropy]] of the watch will increase, and the watch carried back in time will be more worn with each repetition of its history. The second law of thermodynamics is understood by modern physicists to be a [[Statistical mechanics|statistical]] law, so [[fluctuation theorem|decreasing entropy or non-increasing entropy]] are not impossible, just improbable. Additionally, entropy statistically increases in systems which are isolated, so non-isolated systems, such as an object, that interact with the outside world, can become less worn and decrease in entropy, and it's possible for an object whose world-line forms a closed loop to be always in the same condition in the same point of its history.<ref name=\"Gott\" />{{rp|23}}\n\nDaniel Greenberger and [[Karl Svozil]] proposed that [[Quantum mechanics|quantum theory]] gives a model for time travel where the past must be self-consistent.<ref name=\"greenberger\">{{cite book|doi=10.1007/3-540-26669-0_4|title=Quo Vadis Quantum Mechanics?|year=2005|arxiv=quant-ph/0506027|bibcode=2005qvqm.book...63G|chapter=Quantum Theory Looks at Time Travel|series=The Frontiers Collection|last1=Greenberger|first1=Daniel M.|last2=Svozil|first2=Karl|isbn=978-3-540-22188-3|page=63}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Kettlewell|first=Julianna|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/4097258.stm|title=New model 'permits time travel'|work=BBC News|date=June 17, 2005|accessdate=April 26, 2017}}</ref>\n\n== In fiction ==\n{{Further|Time travel in fiction}}\n\nTime travel themes in [[science fiction]] and the media can generally be grouped into three categories: immutable timeline; mutable timeline; and alternate histories, as in the interacting-[[many-worlds interpretation]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Grey|first=William|title=Troubles with Time Travel|journal=Philosophy|volume=74|issue=1|pages=55\u201370|year=1999|publisher=Cambridge University Press|doi=10.1017/S0031819199001047}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Rickman|first=Gregg|title=The Science Fiction Film Reader|publisher=Limelight Editions|year=2004|isbn=978-0-87910-994-3|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780879109943}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Schneider|first=Susan|title=Science Fiction and Philosophy: From Time Travel to Superintelligence|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|year=2009|isbn=978-1-4051-4907-5}}</ref> Frequently in fiction, ''timeline'' is used to refer to all physical events in history, so that in time travel stories where events can be changed, the time traveler is described as creating a new or altered timeline.<ref name=\"Prucher\">Prucher, Jeff (2007) ''Brave New Words: The Oxford Dictionary of Science Fiction'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=iYzi8m8FbEsC&lpg=PP1&pg=PA230 p. 230].</ref> This usage is distinct from the use of the term [[timeline]] to refer to a type of chart that illustrates a particular series of events, and the concept is also distinct from a [[world line]], a term from Einstein's [[theory of relativity]] which refers to the entire history of a ''single'' object.\n\n== See also ==\n{{div col |colwidth=27em}}\n'''Claims of time travel'''\n:*[[Time travel claims and urban legends]]\n'''Culture'''\n:*[[Time capsule]]\n'''Fiction'''\n:*[[Time travel in fiction]]\n:*[[List of time travel works of fiction]]\n:*[[List of games containing time travel]]\n:'''Science'''\n:*[[Krasnikov tube]]\n:*[[Retrocausality]]\n:*[[Ring singularity]]\n:*[[Temporal paradox]]\n:*[[Wheeler\u2013Feynman absorber theory]]\n'''Time perception'''\n:*[[Cryonics]]\n:*[[Suspended animation]]\n:*[[Time perception]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons category|Time travel}}\n{{Wiktionary|time travel}}\n===Overviews and encyclopedic coverage===\n*[http://www.vega.org.uk/video/programme/61 Black holes, Wormholes and Time Travel], a Royal Society Lecture\n*{{HowStuffWorks|time-travel|How Time Travel Will Work}}\n*[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/time-travel-phys/ Time Travel and Modern Physics] at the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy\n*[http://www.iep.utm.edu/t/timetrav.htm Time Travel] at the Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy\n===Articles===\n* [https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/time-travel-ron-mallett-scn/index.html Meet the scientist trying to travel back in time], Francesca Street, CNN \u2022 31st December 2019, CNN. \n* [https://futurism.com/paradox-free-time-travel-parallel-universes Paradox-Free Time Travel Possible With Many Parallel Universes].

His candidacy for [[National Assembly of Mauritius|Parliamentary General Elections]] in [[Constituencies of Mauritius|Constituency No 9, Rose Belle and Vieux Grand Port]] in 2000 made him elected as [[Member of Parliament]] from there. He was appointed as [[Minister of Agriculture]] by President Uteem to serve in the cabinet. He served as Minister under the premiership of his father Anerood Jugnauth who became Prime Minister in 2000 after winning the elections with the [[MSM/MMM]] coalition.\n\nHe was initially found guilty of conflict of interest for a transaction of Rs. 144 million under the Prevention of Corruption Act (PoCA) Law and was sentenced by the Intermediate court of Mauritius for 1 year of imprisonment. He was accused of having reallocated funds to purchase the Medpoint Clinic in which his sister held a majority of shares. He resigned from the government as minister following the sentence. However, he appealed to the Supreme Court of Mauritius and won his appeal.<ref name=\"govmu.org\">[https://supremecourt.govmu.org/scourt/judgment/memberShowDoc.do?id=52768] {{dead link|date=November 2017}}</ref> He was then appointed as Minister of Finance.\n\nOn 23 January 2017, he was chosen by his party to lead the National Assembly and to become Prime Minister following the decision of his father to resign as Prime Minister due of old age. It was constitutional but many people view it as a handing over of power from father to son. This was criticised in the press and around the country by the opposition parties. The [[Parti Mauricien Social D\u00e9mocrate]] left the government due to this and went to sit on opposition benches. \n\nIn the [[2019 Mauritian general election]], the Militant Socialist Movement (MSM) won the majority of seats in parliament and as leader of the MSM, Jugnauth obtained a national plebiscite to remain Prime Minister for a five-year mandate.  \n\nIn 2017 he has awarded the [[Pravasi Bharatiya Samman]] by the [[President of India]].\n\n==Early life and education ==\nBorn on 25 December 1961 in La Caverne, a suburb area in [[Vacoas-Phoenix]], [[Mauritius]], Jugnauth was born into a high class [[Hindu]] [[Yadav]] family. He was born to [[Anerood Jugnauth]], a famous well-known barrister who was the second prime minister of Mauritius and [[Sarojini Jugnauth|Sarojini Ballah]], a school teacher from a well-off family. He has an elder sister, Shalini Jugnauth.\n\nHigh Commissioner Goburdhun being garlanded by Jay Prakash Yadav, a relative of Mauritian Prime Minister Pravind Jugnauth, at Athila village in Rasra sub-division of Ballia district in Uttar Pradesh. An uncle of Mr Yadav who is 95-years-old recalled having heard from his own grandparents that the grandfather of PM Jugnauth, then only a boy of five, and his elder brother, about 16, left for Kolkata and then took a ship to a foreign land (Mauritius), never to return again.\n\nIn various interviews, Pravind stated that he has lived a political life since birth. He stated that his father and uncles were all members of Independent Forward Bloc, a political party led by [[Sookdeo Bissoondoyal]] (a former Minister in the Cabinet of [[Sir Seewoosagur Ramgoolam]]) during the independence rally made by the country in 1967 so as to obtain autonomy from British Authorities.\n\nHis father was one of the few people to attend the conference and meeting on negotiations on the independence of [[Mauritius]]. Pravind Jugnauth states that he remembers all part of it. After independence, his uncle was appointed [[Attorney General]] in cabinet and his father was appointed as Junior Minister. He said he still remembers all negotiations on different aspects on the new constitution.\n\nHis mother put him in the school she was teaching and luckily she became his teacher He always mentioned his mother as his confidant and his father as his inspiration. After primary schooling, he went to [[Royal College Curepipe]] where he passed his O Levels and A levels. He then went on to study law in UK.\n\nJugnauth studied [[Law]] at [[University of Buckingham]], gaining a [[first class honours]] degree. He then joined the [[Lincoln's Inn]] and became a [[Barrister]]. He then joined [[Aix-Marseille University]] in France where he graduated with an [[LLM]]. He officially joined the [[Militant Socialist Movement|MSM]] in 1990 and was honored Doctor from the University of Buckingham with a ''[[Honoris Causa]]'' in 2005.\n\n==2000 to 2005==\nAs Minister of Agriculture from 7 September 2000 to 7 October 2003, Jugnauth presented the Sugar Sector Strategic Plan and led a reform process in the sugar sector to ensure its long-term viability and competitiveness. He initiated a process to convert the sugar industry from relying almost exclusively on the production of sugar into a fully diversified sugar cane industry with emphasis on the production of [[ethanol]], agricultural [[rhum agricole|rhum]], special sugars, electricity generation from [[bagasse]] and other high value added products. After these reforms, the sugar sector has been able to bring down its production costs significantly and better face the challenges stemming from the reduction in the guaranteed sugar price under the [[Common Agricultural Policy|Sugar Protocol]] with the [[European Union]].\n\nWhile working on the reforms in the sugar sector, he negotiated a package for workers under the Voluntary Retirement Scheme. Some 8,000 workers who opted for voluntary retirement received cash compensation exceeding 2.5 billion rupees and some 825 [[arpent]]s of land worth 3 billion rupees.\n\nJugnauth also made reforms in the non-sugar agricultural sector by placing non-sugar agriculture on the path of modernization and sophistication. He encouraged [[hydroponic]]s and other modern methods of production while at the same time strived for excellence in agricultural biotechnology research and expertise in the field. He initiated actions to set up a National Agricultural Biotechnology Institute and Food Technology Laboratory in Mauritius; he later launched the Small Planters Welfare Fund. The fund caters to the welfare of planters and their families and provides crop insurance schemes designed to financially support planters whose crops are affected by unfavorable weather conditions.\n\nAs Minister of Finance from 7 October 2003 to 5 July 2005, Jugnauth reduced taxes on thousands of commodities. He increased subsidies on basic commodities and gave salary compensations well above inflation rates in two successive years. He launched a project to make Mauritius a Duty Free Island.\n\nPravind Jugnauth had some clashes with his then Prime Minister [[Paul Berenger]] however stayed and supported the coalition government.\n\nLeaders said the alliance MSM / MMM, Rama Sithanen insult himself and makes demagogy when it's a failure of government economic policy. In 2004 Pravind Jugnauth mentioned that from 1995 and 2000, the unemployment rate rose from 5.5% to 8.8% with 45,000 unemployed, while in the last three years, 32,000 jobs were created. He also mentioned that despite this heavy legacy, the government MSM / MMM kept the budget deficit to 6% and hopes to return to 5.5% in 2004/2005 and 4% in 2005/2006.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.5plusltd.com/archive/2003/novembre/23_11_2003/eglise.htm|title=5plusltd.com - 5plusltd Resources and Information.|website=5plusltd.com|accessdate=12 November 2017}}</ref>\n\n==2005 to 2009==\nPaul Berenger dissolved parliament in June 2005 and announced that the elections would be held on 3 July. The MSM-MMM coalition knowing the fact that the MSM had weakened throughout the years decided to propose Paul Berenger as candidate for Prime Minister. [[Navin Ramgoolam]] maintained his alliance called the Social Alliance which was composed of the Labour party and other small parties.\n\nThe Social Alliance won a total seat of 38 against the MSM-MMM which obtained only 24 seats. Pravind Jugnauth was defeated in his constituency and received 48% of vote.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gov.mu/portal/site/eco/menuitem.37ba32a3c4783128d6c8662948a521ca/?content_id=223a9dbfa1158010VgnVCM100000ca6a12acRCRD |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-10-30 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101115170724/http://www.gov.mu/portal/site/eco/menuitem.37ba32a3c4783128d6c8662948a521ca/?content_id=223a9dbfa1158010VgnVCM100000ca6a12acRCRD |archivedate=15 November 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> While the MSM had 14 seats and the MMM,the remaining 10,the MSM-MMM proposed Paul Berenger as Leader of the Opposition and maintained the alliance.\n\nIn 2006, Paul Berenger proposed Rajesh Bhagwan another member of the MMM as Opposition Chief Whip. The MSM having more seats than its sister party therefore removed their support from Paul Berenger and broke the coalition. [[Nando Bodha]], general secretary of the MSM became Leader of the Opposition and Pravind Jugnauth continued as Leader outside of Parliament.\n\nAnother feud exploded when Pravind Jugnauth did not approve of [[Ashok Jugnauth]]- who was an elected MSM MP in 2005 and who is Pravind's uncle- to become Leader of the party and assume the responsibilities of Leader of opposition. Ashok Jugnauth left the MSM for democratic reasons stating that the party was a democratic dictatorship with Pravind as the only leader.\n\nIn 2007,two more members of the MSM namely Joe Lesongard, the party's then president and Sekar Naidu left the MSM and sworn allegiance to Berenger and thus he became Leader of the Opposition.\n\nThe MSM had weakened more and more since the leader was not in parliament and therefore they did not have a firm authority.\n\n==2009 By-Election==\n[[Ashok Jugnauth]] who is the brother of [[Sir Anerood Jugnauth]] and uncle of Pravind was the only MSM MP in constituency Quartier Militaire and Moka and lost his seat as the Supreme Court of Mauritius had convicted him for fraud and corruption during 2000 to 2005 when he was Minister of Health. According to law, a MP who is convicted by the court loses his/her seat with immediate effect. Prime Minister Ramgoolam then announced that a By Election would be happening in order to elect an MP.\n\nAshok Jugnauth announced his candidacy for the By Elections and received the support of Paul Berenger and his MMM. The Labour Party decided not to align any candidate in the By-elections and to everybody's surprise provided their support to Pravind Jugnauth and his MSM who then announced his candidacy in the 8th constituency.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gov.mu/portal/site/AssemblySite/menuitem.3bef52ce598560451251701065c521ca/?content_id=71fc3c2fffb85210VgnVCM1000000a04a8c0RCRD |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-05-12 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101007192723/http://www.gov.mu/portal/site/AssemblySite/menuitem.3bef52ce598560451251701065c521ca/?content_id=71fc3c2fffb85210VgnVCM1000000a04a8c0RCRD |archivedate=7 October 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> On 2 March 2009, he beat out his own relative in the partial elections and gained back his seat in Parliament.

He was found guilty of acting as Minister of Finance to reallocate funds to purchase a private hospital (namely Medpoint) of which his sister Shalini Malhotra was a shareholder. \nThe judges ruled that the show of proper ethical standards by PKJ in refusing to have any active decision-making role did not hold any legal standing. This ruling was highly criticised by Senior Counselss including Yousouf Mohamed Q.C, S.C. \nThe ruling was reversed after appeal by the Supreme Court of Mauritius. However, in the interim PKJ submitted his resignation to President [[Ameenah Gurib-Fakim]] as a government minister on 1 July 2015.\n\n==Medpoint Scandal==\nIn 2010, the government decided to buy a hospital and to make it a specialized geriatric center. The cabinet of Ministers approved of buying the MedPoint private Clinic which was owned by Dr Kishan Malhotra and Mrs Shalini Devi Jugnauth Malhotra who is the sister of incumbent Minister of Finance Pravind Jugnauth and daughter of incumbent President [[Sir Anerood Jugnauth]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.kotzot.com/medpoint/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-10-30 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110712225146/http://news.kotzot.com/medpoint/ |archivedate=12 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nIn such matters involving large outlay of public funds, there is what is often called a gestation period and procedures have to be strictly followed and no stone should be left unturned. Although the decision to purchase MedPoint, which was not operating as a clinic at the time and still not operating, was taken by the government, in the use of public funds, the government is under obligation to consider whether this purchase is in the public interest and whether all possible measures have been taken to clinch the deal at the best possible price for the public and not for the owners of MedPoint. The government is also under obligation to demonstrate what safeguards have been put in place to guard against matters such as abuse of power, corruption and so on.\n\nThe government already had in its possession a Valuation Report for \u00ab Land and Building \u00bb for Rs75 million conducted by the government department Valuation and Real Estate Consultancy Services (VRECS) and signed Roshnee Bissessur, No.2 at the Valuation Office, a department affiliated with the Ministry of Finance led by Minister Pravind Jugnauth, brother in law of Dr Malotra, owner of ex-MedPoint Clinic.\n\nMrs Maya Hanoomanjee, then Minister for Health who is a cousin of the Jugnauth family requested, in September 2010, a new valuation for \u00ab Land, Building and Services \u00bb to be obtained within two weeks with the view to closing the deal in December 2010. Mrs Hanoomanjee's yet unjustified urgent request prompted Mr Yodhun Bissessur, the Director of the Valuation Department, to write, on 21 September 2010, to the Ministry of Public Infrastructure (MPI) headed by Minister [[Anil Bachoo]] requesting the expert help of that Ministry in Quantity Surveying for the purposes of the valuation of ex-Medpoint Clinic, which proposed acquisition was for use as a Geriatric Hospital, bearing in mind that the new valuation had to include Services.\n\nAfter missed site visit, further correspondence and twists and turns, the private contractors Hoolooman & Associates were hired to conduct the survey and valuation, reason given being that Navin Ramgoolam's government lacked the necessary quantity surveying human resources to do so. Mr Ramdyal of the Quantity Surveying Unit of the MPI felt the exercise would take at least two months and not two weeks as allegedly demanded by Mrs Hanoomanjee. Also, the new valuation is not said to be confined only to the MedPoint property after depreciation for the purposes of the purchase, but to second hand medical equipment and the cost of a new replacement building at current prices which Mrs Hanoomanjee allegedly wanted, hence her need for a Quantity Surveyor, who is a professional in the construction industry concerned with building costs. Hoolooman & Associates were also originally involved in the construction of the MedPoint Clinic and they valued the Land, Building and Services at Rs.145 million (US$5 Millions). If this valuation contained the replacement cost of the building, the government would have therefore purchased a building which is non-existent and paid the seller for a fictitious building. This in itself should go to the root of the contract and be enough to set it aside.\n\nThe Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC), was formally requested to investigate what has come to be known as MEDPOINTGATE, or the MEDPOINT SCANDAL, a scandal which has the potential to bring down the whole government. Similarities are already drawn with WATERGATE and IRANGATE. In line with the MedPoint investigations, ICAC proceeded to the arrest of two Civil Servants involved in the decisions taken to give the go ahead to the new Rs145m valuation conducted by Hooloman & Associates and upon which the government solely relied for the purchase. The two Civil Servants, Yodhun Bissessur and Aneerood Jeebodhun, the respective Number 1 and Number 3 at the government's Valuation and Real Estate Consultancy Services (VRECS), have, on 5 April 2011, been provisionally charged with \"public official using office for gratification\", for having ordered a second valuation by Hooloman & Associates which allegedly favoured MedPoint over other contenders through the procedure of tender. The charge implies that the two Civil Servants allegedly took bribes when ordering and accepting the Hooloman & Associates Rs145m valuation without question when their own original valuation was for Rs75m. Mr Bissessur reportedly admitted that he knew the private firm had worked for Dr Malotra and detained \u00ab Bill of Quantities \u00bb for his clinic, but nevertheless accepted the firm's valuation of Rs145m without disputing it. Hence, the decision of ICAC to proceed to the arrest of the two Civil Servants in question in the course of their investigations does appear justified.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ile-maurice.com/forum/actualites-de-lile-maurice/10828-maya-hanoomanjee-msm-conspiracy-extremism.html|title=Maya Hanoomanjee and the MSM conspiracy and extremism|website=Ile-maurice.com|accessdate=12 November 2017}}</ref>\n\nThen Minister of Health, [[Maya Hanoomanjee]] was arrested by the ICAC police and the government chief valuer was suspended from his duties.

The prosecution appealed to the Privy Council, but the prosecution appeal was unsuccessful.\n\n==2014-present==\nHe was appointed as Minister of Information Technology following the alliance LEPEP's victory. Local political analysts predicted instability in the government as he was leader of the largest party in parliament and was therefore holding a parallel position to the Prime Minister (his father) in the Westminster style of government.\n\nThough there was various moments of major disagreement including the nomination of Menon Murday as Vice President, the revocation of Roshi Badhain as minister, the dismissal of Vishnu Lutchmeenaraido following the Badhain-Lutchmeenaraidoo dispute and also on government policies. He nevertheless supported the Prime Minister and continued as minister.\n\nWhile many politicians and observers see him as the prime minister in waiting due to Anerood Jugnauth's advanced age, the opposition claims that it would be blatantly undemocratic to appoint him as prime minister without going through the polls in the event that Jugnauth Sr. was not prime minister anymore. On 21 January, Aneerod Jugnauth announced that he will be resigning as Prime Minister as of 23 January, and that he will be succeeded by his son, Pravin Jugnauth.\nThe appointment of Pravin Jugnauth as Prime Minister by his father,Sir Aneerod Jugnauth, was pointed at as a form nepotism, where the father is favoring his son instead of consulting a panel of experts or the general public. Even though it is legal to do so, this law still remains controversial and is often a matter of debate, specially in the UK in the [[Westminster Parliament|Westminster parliament]], from which it is based on.\n\n== Family life ==\nPravind Jugnauth married Kobita Ramdanee in 1992 and is the father of three daughters: Sonika, Sonali and Sara. His father is [[Sir Anerood Jugnauth]] and his mother is [[Sarojini Ballah]].

His candidacy for [[National Assembly of Mauritius|Parliamentary General Elections]] in [[Constituencies of Mauritius|Constituency No 9, Rose Belle and Vieux Grand Port]] in 2000 made him elected as [[Member of Parliament]] from there. He was appointed as [[Minister of Agriculture]] by President Uteem to serve in the cabinet. He served as Minister under the premiership of his father Anerood Jugnauth who became Prime Minister in 2000 after winning the elections with the [[MSM/MMM]] coalition.\n\nHe was initially found guilty of conflict of interest for a transaction of Rs. 144 million under the Prevention of Corruption Act (PoCA) Law and was sentenced by the Intermediate court of Mauritius for 1 year of imprisonment. He was accused of having reallocated funds to purchase the Medpoint Clinic in which his sister held a majority of shares. He resigned from the government as minister following the sentence. However, he appealed to the Supreme Court of Mauritius and won his appeal.<ref name=\"govmu.org\">[https://supremecourt.govmu.org/scourt/judgment/memberShowDoc.do?id=52768] {{dead link|date=November 2017}}</ref> He was then appointed as Minister of Finance.\n\nOn 23 January 2017, he was chosen by his party to lead the National Assembly and to become Prime Minister following the decision of his father to resign as Prime Minister due of old age. It was constitutional but many people view it as a handing over of power from father to son. This was criticised in the press and around the country by the opposition parties. The [[Parti Mauricien Social D\u00e9mocrate]] left the government due to this and went to sit on opposition benches. \n\nIn the [[2019 Mauritian general election]], the Militant Socialist Movement (MSM) won the majority of seats in parliament and as leader of the MSM, Jugnauth obtained a national plebiscite to remain Prime Minister for a five-year mandate.  \n\nIn 2017 he has awarded the [[Pravasi Bharatiya Samman]] by the [[President of India]].\n\n==Early life and education ==\nBorn on 25 December 1961 in La Caverne, a suburb area in [[Vacoas-Phoenix]], [[Mauritius]], Jugnauth was born into a high class [[Hindu]] [[Yadav]] family. He was born to [[Anerood Jugnauth]], a famous well-known barrister who was the second prime minister of Mauritius and [[Sarojini Jugnauth|Sarojini Ballah]], a school teacher from a well-off family. He has an elder sister, Shalini Jugnauth.\n\nHigh Commissioner Goburdhun being garlanded by Jay Prakash Yadav, a relative of Mauritian Prime Minister Pravind Jugnauth, at Athila village in Rasra sub-division of Ballia district in Uttar Pradesh. An uncle of Mr Yadav who is 95-years-old recalled having heard from his own grandparents that the grandfather of PM Jugnauth, then only a boy of five, and his elder brother, about 16, left for Kolkata and then took a ship to a foreign land (Mauritius), never to return again.\n\nIn various interviews, Pravind stated that he has lived a political life since birth. He stated that his father and uncles were all members of Independent Forward Bloc, a political party led by [[Sookdeo Bissoondoyal]] (a former Minister in the Cabinet of [[Sir Seewoosagur Ramgoolam]]) during the independence rally made by the country in 1967 so as to obtain autonomy from British Authorities.\n\nHis father was one of the few people to attend the conference and meeting on negotiations on the independence of [[Mauritius]]. Pravind Jugnauth states that he remembers all part of it. After independence, his uncle was appointed [[Attorney General]] in cabinet and his father was appointed as Junior Minister. He said he still remembers all negotiations on different aspects on the new constitution.\n\nHis mother put him in the school she was teaching and luckily she became his teacher He always mentioned his mother as his confidant and his father as his inspiration. After primary schooling, he went to [[Royal College Curepipe]] where he passed his O Levels and A levels. He then went on to study law in UK.\n\nJugnauth studied [[Law]] at [[University of Buckingham]], gaining a [[first class honours]] degree. He then joined the [[Lincoln's Inn]] and became a [[Barrister]]. He then joined [[Aix-Marseille University]] in France where he graduated with an [[LLM]]. He officially joined the [[Militant Socialist Movement|MSM]] in 1990 and was honored Doctor from the University of Buckingham with a ''[[Honoris Causa]]'' in 2005.\n\n==2000 to 2005==\nAs Minister of Agriculture from 7 September 2000 to 7 October 2003, Jugnauth presented the Sugar Sector Strategic Plan and led a reform process in the sugar sector to ensure its long-term viability and competitiveness. He initiated a process to convert the sugar industry from relying almost exclusively on the production of sugar into a fully diversified sugar cane industry with emphasis on the production of [[ethanol]], agricultural [[rhum agricole|rhum]], special sugars, electricity generation from [[bagasse]] and other high value added products. After these reforms, the sugar sector has been able to bring down its production costs significantly and better face the challenges stemming from the reduction in the guaranteed sugar price under the [[Common Agricultural Policy|Sugar Protocol]] with the [[European Union]].\n\nWhile working on the reforms in the sugar sector, he negotiated a package for workers under the Voluntary Retirement Scheme. Some 8,000 workers who opted for voluntary retirement received cash compensation exceeding 2.5 billion rupees and some 825 [[arpent]]s of land worth 3 billion rupees.\n\nJugnauth also made reforms in the non-sugar agricultural sector by placing non-sugar agriculture on the path of modernization and sophistication. He encouraged [[hydroponic]]s and other modern methods of production while at the same time strived for excellence in agricultural biotechnology research and expertise in the field. He initiated actions to set up a National Agricultural Biotechnology Institute and Food Technology Laboratory in Mauritius; he later launched the Small Planters Welfare Fund. The fund caters to the welfare of planters and their families and provides crop insurance schemes designed to financially support planters whose crops are affected by unfavorable weather conditions.\n\nAs Minister of Finance from 7 October 2003 to 5 July 2005, Jugnauth reduced taxes on thousands of commodities. He increased subsidies on basic commodities and gave salary compensations well above inflation rates in two successive years. He launched a project to make Mauritius a Duty Free Island.\n\nPravind Jugnauth had some clashes with his then Prime Minister [[Paul Berenger]] however stayed and supported the coalition government.\n\nLeaders said the alliance MSM / MMM, Rama Sithanen insult himself and makes demagogy when it's a failure of government economic policy. In 2004 Pravind Jugnauth mentioned that from 1995 and 2000, the unemployment rate rose from 5.5% to 8.8% with 45,000 unemployed, while in the last three years, 32,000 jobs were created. He also mentioned that despite this heavy legacy, the government MSM / MMM kept the budget deficit to 6% and hopes to return to 5.5% in 2004/2005 and 4% in 2005/2006.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.5plusltd.com/archive/2003/novembre/23_11_2003/eglise.htm|title=5plusltd.com - 5plusltd Resources and Information.|website=5plusltd.com|accessdate=12 November 2017}}</ref>\n\n==2005 to 2009==\nPaul Berenger dissolved parliament in June 2005 and announced that the elections would be held on 3 July. The MSM-MMM coalition knowing the fact that the MSM had weakened throughout the years decided to propose Paul Berenger as candidate for Prime Minister. [[Navin Ramgoolam]] maintained his alliance called the Social Alliance which was composed of the Labour party and other small parties.\n\nThe Social Alliance won a total seat of 38 against the MSM-MMM which obtained only 24 seats. Pravind Jugnauth was defeated in his constituency and received 48% of vote.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gov.mu/portal/site/eco/menuitem.37ba32a3c4783128d6c8662948a521ca/?content_id=223a9dbfa1158010VgnVCM100000ca6a12acRCRD |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-10-30 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101115170724/http://www.gov.mu/portal/site/eco/menuitem.37ba32a3c4783128d6c8662948a521ca/?content_id=223a9dbfa1158010VgnVCM100000ca6a12acRCRD |archivedate=15 November 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> While the MSM had 14 seats and the MMM,the remaining 10,the MSM-MMM proposed Paul Berenger as Leader of the Opposition and maintained the alliance.\n\nIn 2006, Paul Berenger proposed Rajesh Bhagwan another member of the MMM as Opposition Chief Whip. The MSM having more seats than its sister party therefore removed their support from Paul Berenger and broke the coalition. [[Nando Bodha]], general secretary of the MSM became Leader of the Opposition and Pravind Jugnauth continued as Leader outside of Parliament.\n\nAnother feud exploded when Pravind Jugnauth did not approve of [[Ashok Jugnauth]]- who was an elected MSM MP in 2005 and who is Pravind's uncle- to become Leader of the party and assume the responsibilities of Leader of opposition. Ashok Jugnauth left the MSM for democratic reasons stating that the party was a democratic dictatorship with Pravind as the only leader.\n\nIn 2007,two more members of the MSM namely Joe Lesongard, the party's then president and Sekar Naidu left the MSM and sworn allegiance to Berenger and thus he became Leader of the Opposition.\n\nThe MSM had weakened more and more since the leader was not in parliament and therefore they did not have a firm authority.\n\n==2009 By-Election==\n[[Ashok Jugnauth]] who is the brother of [[Sir Anerood Jugnauth]] and uncle of Pravind was the only MSM MP in constituency Quartier Militaire and Moka and lost his seat as the Supreme Court of Mauritius had convicted him for fraud and corruption during 2000 to 2005 when he was Minister of Health. According to law, a MP who is convicted by the court loses his/her seat with immediate effect. Prime Minister Ramgoolam then announced that a By Election would be happening in order to elect an MP.\n\nAshok Jugnauth announced his candidacy for the By Elections and received the support of Paul Berenger and his MMM. The Labour Party decided not to align any candidate in the By-elections and to everybody's surprise provided their support to Pravind Jugnauth and his MSM who then announced his candidacy in the 8th constituency.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gov.mu/portal/site/AssemblySite/menuitem.3bef52ce598560451251701065c521ca/?content_id=71fc3c2fffb85210VgnVCM1000000a04a8c0RCRD |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-05-12 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101007192723/http://www.gov.mu/portal/site/AssemblySite/menuitem.3bef52ce598560451251701065c521ca/?content_id=71fc3c2fffb85210VgnVCM1000000a04a8c0RCRD |archivedate=7 October 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> On 2 March 2009, he beat out his own relative in the partial elections and gained back his seat in Parliament.

He was found guilty of acting as Minister of Finance to reallocate funds to purchase a private hospital (namely Medpoint) of which his sister Shalini Malhotra was a shareholder. \nThe judges ruled that the show of proper ethical standards by PKJ in refusing to have any active decision-making role did not hold any legal standing. This ruling was highly criticised by Senior Counselss including Yousouf Mohamed Q.C, S.C. \nThe ruling was reversed after appeal by the Supreme Court of Mauritius. However, in the interim PKJ submitted his resignation to President [[Ameenah Gurib-Fakim]] as a government minister on 1 July 2015.\n\n==Medpoint Scandal==\nIn 2010, the government decided to buy a hospital and to make it a specialized geriatric center. The cabinet of Ministers approved of buying the MedPoint private Clinic which was owned by Dr Kishan Malhotra and Mrs Shalini Devi Jugnauth Malhotra who is the sister of incumbent Minister of Finance Pravind Jugnauth and daughter of incumbent President [[Sir Anerood Jugnauth]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.kotzot.com/medpoint/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-10-30 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110712225146/http://news.kotzot.com/medpoint/ |archivedate=12 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nIn such matters involving large outlay of public funds, there is what is often called a gestation period and procedures have to be strictly followed and no stone should be left unturned. Although the decision to purchase MedPoint, which was not operating as a clinic at the time and still not operating, was taken by the government, in the use of public funds, the government is under obligation to consider whether this purchase is in the public interest and whether all possible measures have been taken to clinch the deal at the best possible price for the public and not for the owners of MedPoint. The government is also under obligation to demonstrate what safeguards have been put in place to guard against matters such as abuse of power, corruption and so on.\n\nThe government already had in its possession a Valuation Report for \u00ab Land and Building \u00bb for Rs75 million conducted by the government department Valuation and Real Estate Consultancy Services (VRECS) and signed Roshnee Bissessur, No.2 at the Valuation Office, a department affiliated with the Ministry of Finance led by Minister Pravind Jugnauth, brother in law of Dr Malotra, owner of ex-MedPoint Clinic.\n\nMrs Maya Hanoomanjee, then Minister for Health who is a cousin of the Jugnauth family requested, in September 2010, a new valuation for \u00ab Land, Building and Services \u00bb to be obtained within two weeks with the view to closing the deal in December 2010. Mrs Hanoomanjee's yet unjustified urgent request prompted Mr Yodhun Bissessur, the Director of the Valuation Department, to write, on 21 September 2010, to the Ministry of Public Infrastructure (MPI) headed by Minister [[Anil Bachoo]] requesting the expert help of that Ministry in Quantity Surveying for the purposes of the valuation of ex-Medpoint Clinic, which proposed acquisition was for use as a Geriatric Hospital, bearing in mind that the new valuation had to include Services.\n\nAfter missed site visit, further correspondence and twists and turns, the private contractors Hoolooman & Associates were hired to conduct the survey and valuation, reason given being that Navin Ramgoolam's government lacked the necessary quantity surveying human resources to do so. Mr Ramdyal of the Quantity Surveying Unit of the MPI felt the exercise would take at least two months and not two weeks as allegedly demanded by Mrs Hanoomanjee. Also, the new valuation is not said to be confined only to the MedPoint property after depreciation for the purposes of the purchase, but to second hand medical equipment and the cost of a new replacement building at current prices which Mrs Hanoomanjee allegedly wanted, hence her need for a Quantity Surveyor, who is a professional in the construction industry concerned with building costs. Hoolooman & Associates were also originally involved in the construction of the MedPoint Clinic and they valued the Land, Building and Services at Rs.145 million (US$5 Millions). If this valuation contained the replacement cost of the building, the government would have therefore purchased a building which is non-existent and paid the seller for a fictitious building. This in itself should go to the root of the contract and be enough to set it aside.\n\nThe Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC), was formally requested to investigate what has come to be known as MEDPOINTGATE, or the MEDPOINT SCANDAL, a scandal which has the potential to bring down the whole government. Similarities are already drawn with WATERGATE and IRANGATE. In line with the MedPoint investigations, ICAC proceeded to the arrest of two Civil Servants involved in the decisions taken to give the go ahead to the new Rs145m valuation conducted by Hooloman & Associates and upon which the government solely relied for the purchase. The two Civil Servants, Yodhun Bissessur and Aneerood Jeebodhun, the respective Number 1 and Number 3 at the government's Valuation and Real Estate Consultancy Services (VRECS), have, on 5 April 2011, been provisionally charged with \"public official using office for gratification\", for having ordered a second valuation by Hooloman & Associates which allegedly favoured MedPoint over other contenders through the procedure of tender. The charge implies that the two Civil Servants allegedly took bribes when ordering and accepting the Hooloman & Associates Rs145m valuation without question when their own original valuation was for Rs75m. Mr Bissessur reportedly admitted that he knew the private firm had worked for Dr Malotra and detained \u00ab Bill of Quantities \u00bb for his clinic, but nevertheless accepted the firm's valuation of Rs145m without disputing it. Hence, the decision of ICAC to proceed to the arrest of the two Civil Servants in question in the course of their investigations does appear justified.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ile-maurice.com/forum/actualites-de-lile-maurice/10828-maya-hanoomanjee-msm-conspiracy-extremism.html|title=Maya Hanoomanjee and the MSM conspiracy and extremism|website=Ile-maurice.com|accessdate=12 November 2017}}</ref>\n\nThen Minister of Health, [[Maya Hanoomanjee]] was arrested by the ICAC police and the government chief valuer was suspended from his duties.

The prosecution appealed to the Privy Council, but the prosecution appeal was unsuccessful.\n\n==2014-present==\nHe was appointed as Minister of Information Technology following the alliance LEPEP's victory. Local political analysts predicted instability in the government as he was leader of the largest party in parliament and was therefore holding a parallel position to the Prime Minister (his father) in the Westminster style of government.\n\nThough there was various moments of major disagreement including the nomination of Menon Murday as Vice President, the revocation of Roshi Badhain as minister, the dismissal of Vishnu Lutchmeenaraido following the Badhain-Lutchmeenaraidoo dispute and also on government policies. He nevertheless supported the Prime Minister and continued as minister.\n\nWhile many politicians and observers see him as the prime minister in waiting due to Anerood Jugnauth's advanced age, the opposition claims that it would be blatantly undemocratic to appoint him as prime minister without going through the polls in the event that Jugnauth Sr. was not prime minister anymore. On 21 January, Aneerod Jugnauth announced that he will be resigning as Prime Minister as of 23 January, and that he will be succeeded by his son, Pravin Jugnauth.\nThe appointment of Pravin Jugnauth as Prime Minister by his father,Sir Aneerod Jugnauth, was pointed at as a form nepotism, where the father is favoring his son instead of consulting a panel of experts or the general public. Even though it is legal to do so, this law still remains controversial and is often a matter of debate, specially in the UK in the [[Westminster Parliament|Westminster parliament]], from which it is based on.\n\n== Family life ==\nPravind Jugnauth married Kobita Ramdanee in 1992 and is the father of three daughters: Sonika, Sonali and Sara. His father is [[Sir Anerood Jugnauth]] and his mother is [[Sarojini Ballah]].

She was the head of the [[Sex and the law|sex crimes]] unit of the [[New York County District Attorney|Manhattan District Attorney]]'s office from 1976 until 2002. \n\nDuring that time, she oversaw the prosecution of the [[Central Park jogger case|Central Park Five case]], wherein five teenagers, four African-American and one Hispanic, were wrongfully convicted for the 1989 rape and assault in Central Park of a white female jogger. All five convictions were vacated in 2002 after Matias Reyes, a convicted serial rapist and murderer, confessed to having been the sole perpetrator of the crime, and DNA testing showed he was the sole contributor of the DNA of the semen on the victim. After Reyes's confession in 2002, Fairstein still maintained that the wrongfully convicted teenage boys were guilty and she lauded the police investigation as \"brilliant\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/linda-fairstein-netflix-when-they-see-us-central-park-five-844864/|title=Who Is Linda Fairstein, the Prosecutor in \u2018When They See Us\u2019?|last=Dickson|first=E.

The Pravarapura Nandivardhana branch ruled from different capitals like Pravarapura (Paunar) in [[Wardha district]] and [[Mansar, India|Mansar]] and Nandivardhan (Nagardhan) in [[Nagpur district]]. This branch used to maintain matrimonial alliances with the [[Guptas]].\n\nThe Vatsagulma branch was founded by [[Sarvasena]], the second son of [[Pravarasena I]] after his death. Sarvasena made Vatsagulma (present-day [[Washim]]) his capital. The territory ruled by this branch was between the Sahydri Range and the [[Godavari River]]. They patronised some of the Buddhist caves at [[Ajanta Caves|Ajanta]].\nPrabhavatigupta was the queen and regent of the V\u0101k\u0101\u1e6daka Empire. Her father was [[Chandragupta II]] of the [[Gupta Empire]] and her mother was Kuberanaga of the Naga. She married Rudrasena II of the V\u0101k\u0101\u1e6daka. After his death in 385, she ruled as regent for her two young sons, Divakarasena and Damodarasena for twenty years. {{citation needed|date=April 2017}} This region is named after the mythological [[Vidarbha Kingdom]] mentioned in the [[Mahabharata]].\n\n===Medieval period===\n[[File:Paramaras of Vidarbha King Jagaddeva 12th-13th centuries.jpg|thumb|Coin of King [[Jagadeva]] of the [[Paramara dynasty|Paramaras]] of Vidarbha, 12th\u201313th centuries CE.]]\n\n[[Nagpur]] was the capital of the [[Berar Subah]], known as the Gulshan-e-Berar in the [[Medieval India|Medieval period]], from the rule of the [[Khalji dynasty|Khaljis]] to the [[Mughals]], according to the ''[[Ain-i-Akbari]]'' and Alamgir Namah.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} In 1724, when Nizam-ul-Mulk Asaf Jah declared independence, the existence of Berar as a Mughal Subah came to an end.

In 1853 \"[[Nagpur Province]]\"  was formed with Nagpur as its capital. It was administered by a commissioner under the central government.\n* 1861: \"[[Central Provinces and Berar|Central Province]]\" was formed by the British, with Nagpur as its capital.\n* 1903: On 1 October Berar was also placed under the administration of the commissioner of Central Provinces. It was now named \"[[Central Province and Berar]]\".\n* 1935: [[Government of India Act 1935|Government of India Act]], passed by British parliament, formed provincial assembly to provide for an election.  Central Province and Berar was kept a separate entity, with Nagpur as its capital.\n* 1950: When the [[Constitution of India]] went into effect in 1950, Central Province and Berar became [[Madhya Pradesh]], with Nagpur as its capital.\n* 1956: \"[[Vidarbha State]]\" with Nagpur as its capital was recommended by the [[States Reorganisation Commission]]. Instead, the area was made part of [[Bombay State]].\n* 1960: On 1 May Bombay State was dissolved and the \"Vidarbha State\" was merged with the newly formed [[Maharashtra]] State.\n\nIn recent years there have been sporadic calls for Vidarbha to secede from Maharashtra. This is based on a feeling of being neglected by the [[Government of Maharashtra|Maharashtra state government]] and a desire to assert a distinct political identity. The region has been seen to have fallen behind others in Maharashtra in attracting investment and development funds, being comparatively poorly served by roads, irrigation facilities and educational institutions. However political movements for attaining statehood have failed to hold sway as their leaders have been considered opportunistic and corrupt. [[Vidarbha Rajya Party]] and [[Vidarbha Rajya Nirman Congress]] are very small political parties created by leaders that have split from national-level parties like [[Indian National Congress]] (INC). The only national party to officially support Vidarbha state is [[Bhartiya Janata Party]] (BJP), which included this demand in its national manifesto.\n\nPolitician and economist [[Shrikant Jichkar|Dr. Shrikant Jichkar]] opposed separation of Vidarbha from Maharashtra, believing that that it was not sustainable: \"If Vidarbha is hived off, we will have no funds from day one to run the new State. The region's share is burdened by a deficit and Monopoly Cotton Purchase Scheme, Employment Guarantee Scheme and such activity will immediately cease since we would not have money to pay salaries.\" He noted that income from available natural resources could not balance Mumbai's subsidies, and that Mumbai's cooperation was vital to any development\u2014in addition to the societal risks of dividing the Marathi-speaking state.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindu.com/2000/09/09/stories/0209000g.htm |title=Vidarbha not viable economically |work=The Hindu|date=9 September 2000}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Dehani lift irrigation scheme]]\n* [[List of cities in Vidarbha]]\n* [[List of Maratha dynasties and states]]\n* [[Manav Vikas Mission]]\n* [[Proposed states and territories of India]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category}}\n* [http://vidarbhaenv.blogspot.in/ Article regarding environment of Vidarbha by Dr. Heda]\n* [http://www.tigertrails.in Tigertrails]\n*[https://tadoba-national-park-booking.com/ National Park In Vidarbha]\n* {{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Berar |volume=3 |page=763}} This details the history of the province up to 1903, and itself cites {{Citation|title=Imperial Gazetteer of India}} (Oxford, 1908)\n\n{{Coord missing|Maharashtra}}\n{{Maharashtra|logo=yes}}\n{{Vidarbha}}\n{{Godavari basin}}\n{{Proposed states and territories of India}}\n\n[[Category:Regions of India]]\n[[Category:Regions of Maharashtra]]\n[[Category:Proposed states and territories of India]]\n[[Category:Vidarbha| ]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=October 2019}}\n{{Use Indian English|date=August 2017}}\n{{Infobox settlement\n| name                    = Vidarbha\n| other_name              =\n| settlement_type         = Former state and historical region <!--Do not remove either without discussing on Talk Page-->\n| image_skyline           = Vidarbha Region.png\n| image_alt               = \n| image_caption           = '''Dark Blue''' : Nagpur District, '''Blue''' : Nagpur Region, '''Grey''' : Amravati District, '''Light Blue''' : Amravati Region\n| nickname                = \n| image_map               = India Vidarbha locator map.svg\n| map_alt                 = \n| map_caption             = Map of India with Vidarbha highlighted in red\n| pushpin_map             = \n| pushpin_label_position  = \n| pushpin_map_alt         = \n| pushpin_map_caption     = \n| coordinates             = \n| subdivision_type        = Country\n| subdivision_name        = [[India]]\n| subdivision_type1       = [[States and territories of India|State]]\n| subdivision_name1       = [[Maharashtra]]\n| established_title       = <!-- Established -->\n| established_date        = \n| founder                 = \n| named_for               = \n| government_type         = \n| governing_body          =[[Government of Maharashtra]] \n| unit_pref               = Metric\n| area_footnotes          = <ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite web|url=http://www.mh-31.com/nagpur/about-nagpur/nagpur-general/496-population-census-nagpur# |title=Population |date=31 March 2011 |accessdate=6 April 2011}}</ref>\n| area_total_km2          = 97321\n| area_rank               = \n| elevation_footnotes     = \n| elevation_m             = \n| population_total        = 23,003,179\n| population_as_of        = 2011\n| population_footnotes    = \n| population_density_km2  = auto\n| population_rank         = \n| population_demonym      = Vaidharbhiya \n| demographics_type1      = Language\n| demographics1_title1    = Official\n| demographics1_info1     = [[Marathi language|Marathi]]\n| timezone1               = [[Indian Standard Time|IST]]\n| utc_offset1             = +5:30\n| postal_code_type        = <!-- [[Postal Index Number|PIN]] -->\n| postal_code             = \n| registration_plate      = MH-\n| unemployment_rate       = \n| blank1_name_sec1        = Largest city\n| blank1_info_sec1        = [[Nagpur]]\n| website                 = \n| footnotes               = \n}}\n'''Vidarbha''' is the north-eastern region of the Indian state of [[Maharashtra]], comprising [[Nagpur Division]] and [[Amravati Division]].

It is featured in the epic ''Mahabharata'', where Bheema killed the villainous Keechaka, and so came to be known as Keechakadara\u2014Chikhaldara. It is the only hill resort in the Vidarbha region, at an elevation of {{convert|1118|m}}, with a number of lookout points.  Wildlife include panthers, sloth bears, sambar, wild boar, and wild dogs. The nearby Melghat Tiger Project has 82 tigers.

In 1853 \"[[Nagpur Province]]\"  was formed with Nagpur as its capital. It was administered by a commissioner under the central government.\n* 1861: \"[[Central Provinces and Berar|Central Province]]\" was formed by the British, with Nagpur as its capital.\n* 1903: On 1 October Berar was also placed under the administration of the commissioner of Central Provinces. It was now named \"[[Central Province and Berar]]\".\n* 1935: [[Government of India Act 1935|Government of India Act]], passed by British parliament, formed provincial assembly to provide for an election.  Central Province and Berar was kept a separate entity, with Nagpur as its capital.\n* 1950: When the [[Constitution of India]] went into effect in 1950, Central Province and Berar became [[Madhya Pradesh]], with Nagpur as its capital.\n* 1956: \"[[Vidarbha State]]\" with Nagpur as its capital was recommended by the [[States Reorganisation Commission]]. Instead, the area was made part of [[Bombay State]].\n* 1960: On 1 May Bombay State was dissolved and the \"Vidarbha State\" was merged with the newly formed [[Maharashtra]] State.\n\nIn recent years there have been sporadic calls for Vidarbha to secede from Maharashtra. This is based on a feeling of being neglected by the [[Government of Maharashtra|Maharashtra state government]] and a desire to assert a distinct political identity. The region has been seen to have fallen behind others in Maharashtra in attracting investment and development funds, being comparatively poorly served by roads, irrigation facilities and educational institutions. However political movements for attaining statehood have failed to hold sway as their leaders have been considered opportunistic and corrupt. [[Vidarbha Rajya Party]] and [[Vidarbha Rajya Nirman Congress]] are very small political parties created by leaders that have split from national-level parties like [[Indian National Congress]] (INC). The only national party to officially support Vidarbha state is [[Bhartiya Janata Party]] (BJP), which included this demand in its national manifesto.\n\nPolitician and economist [[Shrikant Jichkar|Dr. Shrikant Jichkar]] opposed separation of Vidarbha from Maharashtra, believing that that it was not sustainable: \"If Vidarbha is hived off, we will have no funds from day one to run the new State. The region's share is burdened by a deficit and Monopoly Cotton Purchase Scheme, Employment Guarantee Scheme and such activity will immediately cease since we would not have money to pay salaries.\" He noted that income from available natural resources could not balance Mumbai's subsidies, and that Mumbai's cooperation was vital to any development\u2014in addition to the societal risks of dividing the Marathi-speaking state.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindu.com/2000/09/09/stories/0209000g.htm |title=Vidarbha not viable economically |work=The Hindu|date=9 September 2000}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Dehani lift irrigation scheme]]\n* [[List of cities in Vidarbha]]\n* [[List of Maratha dynasties and states]]\n* [[Manav Vikas Mission]]\n* [[Proposed states and territories of India]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category}}\n* [http://vidarbhaenv.blogspot.in/ Article regarding environment of Vidarbha by Dr. Heda]\n* [http://www.tigertrails.in Tigertrails]\n*[https://tadoba-national-park-booking.com/ National Park In Vidarbha]\n* {{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Berar |volume=3 |page=763}} This details the history of the province up to 1903, and itself cites {{Citation|title=Imperial Gazetteer of India}} (Oxford, 1908)\n\n{{Coord missing|Maharashtra}}\n{{Maharashtra|logo=yes}}\n{{Vidarbha}}\n{{Godavari basin}}\n{{Proposed states and territories of India}}\n\n[[Category:Regions of India]]\n[[Category:Regions of Maharashtra]]\n[[Category:Proposed states and territories of India]]\n[[Category:Vidarbha| ]]\n", "name_user": "2409:4042:258b:59ff:6409:788e:f637:c62e", "label": "vandal", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eReligion)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vidarbha"}

In [[South Asia|South]] and [[Southeast Asia]] it is celebrated as ''[[Vesak]]'', which places greater emphasis on the enlightenment and death of the Buddha. According to the Theravada [[Tripitaka]] [[Buddhist texts|scriptures]]{{Which|date=November 2010}}, Gautama was born c. 563\u2013480 BCE in [[Lumbini]] in modern-day Nepal, and raised in the Shakya capital of [[Kapilavastu (ancient city)|Kapilavastu]] ,Nepal.<ref>UNESCO, [https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/666 Lumbini in Nepal is the birthplace of the Lord Buddha], Gethin ''Foundations'', p. 19, which states that in the mid-3rd century BCE the Emperor [[Ashoka]] determined that Lumbini was Gautama's birthplace and thus installed a pillar there with the inscription: \"... this is where the Buddha, sage of the \u015a\u0101kyas (''\u015a\u0101kyamuni''), was born.\"</ref><ref>For instance, Gethin ''Foundations'', p. 14, states: \"The earliest Buddhist sources state that the future Buddha was born Siddh\u0101rtha Gautama (Pali Siddhattha Gotama), the son of a local chieftain\u2014a ''r\u0101jan''\u2014in Kapilavastu (Pali Kapilavatthu) what is now the Indian\u2013Nepalese border.\" However, Professor Gombrich (''Therav\u0101da Buddhism'', p. 1) and the old but specialized study by Edward Thomas, ''The Life of the Buddha'', ascribe the name Siattha/fitta to later sources.</ref>\n\nThe exact date of Buddha's birthday is based on the Asian [[lunisolar calendar]]s.

In modern-day India and Nepal, where the Historical [[Buddha]] lived, it is celebrated on the full moon day of the [[Vaisakha]] month of the Buddhist calendar. In Theravada countries following the Buddhist calendar, it falls on a full moon Uposatha day, typically in the 5th or 6th lunar month. In China and Korea, it is celebrated on the eighth day of the fourth month in the Chinese lunar calendar. The date varies from year to year in the Western Gregorian calendar, but usually falls in April or May. In leap years it may be celebrated in June. In Tibet, it falls on the 7th day of the fourth month of the Tibetan calendar (2019 June 9, in other years in May).\n\n=== South and Southeast Asia and Mongolia ===\nIn [[South Asia]]n and [[Southeast Asia]]n countries as well as [[Mongolia]], Buddha's birthday is celebrated on the full moon day of the [[Vaisakha]] month of the Buddhist calendar and the [[Hindu calendar]], which usually falls in April or May month of the Western Gregorian calendar. The festival is known as Buddha Purnima, as Purnima means full moon day in Sanskrit.

Buddhist monks teach celebrants about the Dharma and the [[Five precepts|Five Precepts]] (panchashila). Buddhists then attend a congression inside the monastery where the chief monk would deliver a speech discussing the Buddha and the [[Triratna|Three Jewels]] (tri-ratna), and about living the ideal life.

In modern-day India and Nepal, where the Historical [[Buddha]] lived, it is celebrated on the full moon day of the [[Vaisakha]] month of the Buddhist calendar. In Theravada countries following the Buddhist calendar, it falls on a full moon Uposatha day, typically in the 5th or 6th lunar month. In China and Korea, it is celebrated on the eighth day of the fourth month in the Chinese lunar calendar. The date varies from year to year in the Western Gregorian calendar, but usually falls in April or May. In leap years it may be celebrated in June.

In 1968 the first [[circumambulation]] of Mt. Tamalpais to celebrate Buddha's Birthday was conducted. Starting in 1969 at Tassajara Zen Mountain Center, ''Hana-Matsuri'' was celebrated each spring. Dressed in formal black robes, the roughly 70 monks and students formed a formal procession to the Horse Pasture with the leader periodically ringing a small, clear bell. A temporary stone altar was built under a huge oak tree in a gorgeous field of green grass and abundant wildflowers; a small statue of a baby Buddha was placed upon it in a metal basin. Then each person would, in turn, approach the altar, ladle one thin-lipped bamboo dipperful of sweet green tea over the statue, bow, and walk to one side.<ref>http://www.japanese-city.com/calendar/events/index.php?eID=32066</ref>\n\nIn [[New York City|New York]], the ''International Lotus Lantern Parade'' has been a notable and successful annual event held at [[Union Square Park]]. The event celebrates the Buddha's birthday and ''Yeon Deung Hoe'' (\uc5f0\ub4f1\ud68c), a Korean lantern celebration that is held during Vesak. The festival features a number of Buddhist themed events and is started off by numerous Buddhist centres of Japanese, Korean and Sri Lankan origins for example.<ref>http://interfaithcenter.org/archives/5318</ref>\n\nSince 1963, the state of Hawaii has recognized April 8 of each year as \"Buddha Day\", which celebrates the birth of Siddhartha Gautama, the founder of Buddhism.\n\n== See also ==\n{{refbegin|3}} \n*[[List of Buddhist festivals]] \n*[[List of festivals in Asia]] \n* [[Public holidays in Nepal]]\n* [[Public holidays in India]]\n* [[Public holidays in Hong Kong]]\n* [[Bun Festival]] - a festival held on the same day in Hong Kong.\n* [[Public holidays in Macau]]\n* [[Public holidays in North Korea]]\n* [[Public holidays in South Korea]]\n* [[Holidays in Taiwan]]\n* [[Holidays of Japan]]\n* [[Public holidays in Bangladesh]]\n* [[Hanami]]\n* [[Public holidays in Myanmar]]\n* [[Holidays in Vietnam]]\n* [[Public holidays in Thailand]]\n* [[Public holidays in Sri Lanka]]\n* [[Public holidays in Bhutan]]\n* [[Public holidays in Singapore]]\n* [[Public holidays in Indonesia]]\n* [[Vesak]]\n{{refend}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|40em}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* The Folkloric Study of Chopail (Buddha's Birthday), written by Prof. M.Y.Pyeon.
