It originally aired on [[Comedy Central]] in the United States on April 14, 2010. In the episode, [[Tom Cruise]] and all other celebrities who have been mocked by residents of South Park in the past plan to file a [[class action]] lawsuit against the town, but Cruise promises to end the lawsuit if the town can get the [[Islamic]] prophet [[Muhammad]] to meet him.\n\nThe episode was written and directed by series co-creator [[Trey Parker]]. To celebrate their landmark episode, Parker and fellow series co-creator [[Matt Stone]] combined many of ''South Park''{{'}}s past storylines and controversies. The Muhammad subplot, similar to the one previously featured in the [[South Park (season 10)|season 10]] episode \"[[Cartoon Wars Part II|Cartoon Wars]]\", refers to Comedy Central's past refusal to allow [[Depictions of Muhammad|images of Muhammad]] to be shown on the network in response to the riots and threats generated from controversial cartoons in [[Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy|2005]] and [[Lars Vilks Muhammad drawings controversy|2007]] of Muhammad in European newspapers.\n\n\"200\" includes many celebrities that have been mocked in previous episodes, including Cruise, [[Rob Reiner]], [[Steven Spielberg]], [[Kanye West]], [[Paris Hilton]], [[George Lucas]], [[Mel Gibson]] and [[Barbra Streisand]]. An additional subplot includes Cartman learning he may not know the true identity of his father. The 1998 [[South Park (season 2)|season 2]] episode \"[[Cartman's Mom Is Still a Dirty Slut]]\" claimed that Cartman's [[hermaphrodite]] [[Liane Cartman|mother]] is his father, but the events of \"200\" and [[201 (South Park)|the subsequent episode]] reveal that this is not the case.\n\n\"200\" received mostly positive reviews. According to [[Nielsen ratings|Nielsen Media Research]], the episode was seen by 3.33 million viewers, making it the most watched cable television program of the night. Both \"200\" and the sequel episode \"[[201 (South Park)|201]]\" were nominated for the [[Primetime Emmy Award]] for Outstanding Animated Program in 2010.<ref name='2010emmy'>{{cite web|url=http://www.emmys.com/sites/emmys.com/files/62ndemmys_noms.pdf |title=Complete Emmy listings |accessdate=November 26, 2014 |last=Emmy Awards |format=PDF |publisher=Emmy Award |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/65blzi3QZ?url=http://www.emmys.com/sites/emmys.com/files/62ndemmys_noms.pdf |archivedate=February 21, 2012 |url-status=dead  }}</ref>\nWithin a week of the episode's original broadcast date, the website for the radical Muslim organization [[Revolution Muslim]] posted an entry warning Parker and Stone that they risked being murdered for airing the episode, which several media outlets and observers interpreted as a threat. As a result, Comedy Central heavily censored portions of \"201\" by removing references to Muhammad and the episode's closing speech. The episode was rated [[TV-MA L]] in the United States. \n\n==Plot==\nWhile on a school [[field trip]] to a [[candy]] factory, [[Butters Stotch|Butters]] spots actor [[Tom Cruise]] working there, packing fudge into boxes. [[Stan Marsh|Stan]], who previously told Cruise that his acting is not as good as others' in \"[[Trapped in the Closet (South Park)|Trapped in the Closet]]\", accidentally insults him again by calling him a \"[[:wikt:fudge packer|fudge packer]]\", as Cruise claims to be [[fly fishing]]. Cruise then recruits 200 other celebrities who have been ridiculed by the town of South Park to bring a [[class action]] lawsuit against the town. Stan returns to the factory with his father [[Randy and Sharon Marsh|Randy]] to try to apologize and convince Cruise to drop the suit, but also finds it difficult not to call him a fudge packer as well since he was literally packing fudge while they spoke. An angry Cruise agrees to do so, but only if they can help Cruise meet [[Muhammad]]. This causes an uproar because [[depictions of Muhammad]] are forbidden, and the townsfolk fear that forcing Muhammad to appear in public will drive Muslim radicals to bomb the town. Stan and Kyle go to the [[Super Best Friends]], a squad of superhero-like religious figures ([[Jesus Christ]], [[Gautama Buddha]], [[Moses]], [[Krishna]], [[Laozi]], [[Joseph Smith]]) of which Muhammad is a member, to request he return with them to South Park. Meanwhile, it is revealed that Cruise and the other celebrities only want Muhammad for his \"goo\", as [[Rob Reiner]], previously shown to be filled with \"goo\" in \"[[Butt Out]]\", has invented a machine to transfer Muhammad's \"goo\" to the celebrities, which they believe will make them immune to ridicule, just like Muhammad.\n\nBy this time, [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]] arrives with \"Mitch Conner\", a face painted on his hand as one-half of a [[ventriloquism|ventriloquist act]]. Previously, Connor had successfully impersonated actress [[Jennifer Lopez]] in \"[[Fat Butt and Pancake Head]]\", and now Cartman and Connor return to the Lopez imitation in order to get involved in the lawsuit along with the other celebrities. Connor soon secretly convinces Cartman that they should steal Muhammad's goo for themselves to sell on the black market for more than the lawsuit could offer. Meanwhile, Kyle and Stan convince the Super Best Friends to let Muhammad come to town, but only if he stays in the back of a [[U-Haul]] truck and is not seen. When the townspeople realize they must bring Muhammad to Cruise's limo, they allegedly put him inside a bear mascot outfit. South Park is about to give Muhammad to the celebrities when the exchange is interrupted by a bomb planted by the [[Ginger Kids]], a group of fair-skinned, red-haired children who are tired of being made fun of for their physical appearance.  The Gingers want Muhammad for themselves, hoping to use his goo for their own means. They threaten to blow up the town if Muhammad is not turned over to them.\n\nThe people of South Park decide to turn Muhammad over to the Gingers, fearing the violence that will befall their town if they do not. The celebrities are angered by this change in events, but refuse to resort to violence for fear of ruining their careers. Instead, the celebrities decide to awaken the rebuilt [[Mecha-Streisand]], a giant mechanical monster form of [[Barbra Streisand]], who previously terrorized the town of South Park before being destroyed. The celebrities hope to use Mecha-Streisand to force South Park to accept their demands. Meanwhile, due to the chain of events, Cartman decides Connor's scheme has become too complicated and tries to quit, but Connor convinces him to stay involved by revealing that the townspeople of South Park have lied to Cartman about his true father. Although they previously claimed his [[hermaphrodite|hermaphroditic]] [[Liane Cartman|mother]] was also his father, Connor insists this is a lie. Cartman confronts his school teacher [[Mr. Garrison]] and Garrison's old hand puppet [[Mr. Hat]], who admits to Cartman there was indeed a cover-up. Mecha-Streisand roars threateningly and continues her reign of destruction as the episode ends.\n\n==Production==\n{{Quote box |quoted=true |bgcolor=#FFFFF0 |salign=center |width=200px |align=right | quote = We kind of came up with the idea of, like, let's take our sort of most popular moments in the show and then put them all together and write them into a new show.

This is based on two past controversies in 2005 ([[Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy]]) and 2007 ([[Lars Vilks Muhammad drawings controversy]]), when European newspapers published cartoons of Muhammad, which was responded to with reactions of violent riots, global protests and death threats toward the artists.

This is a reference to Streisand's appearance in the first-season episode \"[[Mecha-Streisand]]\", in which she transforms into a monster in the style of [[Mechagodzilla]] from the [[Godzilla (franchise)|Godzilla franchise]]. The Mecha-Streisand featured in \"200\" is designed with more sophisticated computer imagery than the original, which was a simple cut-out style cartoon like the rest of ''South Park''.<ref name=\"AVClub\" /><ref name=\"IGN\" /> Although Parker and Stone have maintained that most of the celebrities they mock in ''South Park'' are chosen at random, with no personal animosity behind it, Barbra Streisand is one of the few they actively and vehemently dislike.<ref>{{cite video | people=[[Trey Parker|Parker, Trey]] |date=2003|title=South Park: The Complete First Season: \"Mecha-Streisand\"|type=Audio commentary CD |publisher=Comedy Central}}</ref> Streisand, in turn, has been critical of ''South Park'' and her portrayal in it, and has accused the show of adding \"to the cynicism and negativity in our culture, especially in children\".<ref name=\"Mirabella\">{{cite news|title=The Way She Is|last=Dreifus|first=Claudia|authorlink=Claudia Dreifus|date=May 1998|work=[[Hachette Filipacchi M\u00e9dias]]}}</ref>\n\n===Cartman's father===\nThe episode ends with a [[cliffhanger]] involving Cartman's father.<ref name=\"IGN\" /><ref name=\"WCAU\" /> The identity of Cartman's father made up a major plot point at the end of the [[South Park (season 1)|first season]], culminating in the [[South Park (season 2)|second season]] episode \"[[Cartman's Mom Is Still a Dirty Slut]]\", in which it is revealed Cartman's mother, [[Liane Cartman]], is a [[hermaphrodite]] and, in fact, is Cartman's father. \"200\" is the first episode to return to the matter and suggest this was not the actual truth.<ref name=\"EW0415\" /> Throughout the episode, Cartman uses a hand-puppet con-artist named Mitch Conner, who had, presumably, just been made up by Cartman in trying to fool Kyle in the seventh-season episode \"[[Fat Butt and Pancake Head]]\", resuming his role in pretending to be [[Jennifer Lopez]] and utilizing many offensive [[Hispanic]] stereotypes in his portrayal of her.<ref name=\"AVClub\" /><ref name=\"IGN\" /> The hand puppet portrayal is very similar to the work of Spanish ventriloquist [[Se\u00f1or Wences]].<ref name=\"EW0415\" />\n\nSeveral other references to previous ''South Park'' episodes are featured throughout \"200\". It marks the reappearance of [[Herbert Garrison#Mr. Hat|Mr. Hat]], a hand puppet that had been frequently used by Mr. Garrison during the early ''South Park'' seasons, but had long been abandoned in later episodes.<ref name=\"IGN\" /><ref name=\"EW0415\" /> During the second half of \"200\", an army of red-haired \"ginger kids\" attempt to capture Muhammad themselves. Several ''South Park'' episodes, most prominently the ninth-season episode \"[[Ginger Kids]]\", have featured the ginger kids, which are children with fair skin, freckles and red hair. In most cases, they have been made the subject of ridicule by Cartman, who views them in an offensively stereotypical way.<ref name=\"EW0415\" /><ref>{{cite news |work=[[Metro (Associated Metro Limited)|Metro]] |title=Celebrating South Park's 200 episode: Five of the best |date=April 15, 2010 |url=http://www.metro.co.uk/news/821914-celebrating-south-parks-200-episode-five-of-the-best |accessdate=April 15, 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100418210433/http://www.metro.co.uk/news/821914-celebrating-south-parks-200-episode-five-of-the-best| archivedate=April 18, 2010 | url-status= live}}</ref>\n\n==Cultural references==\nDuring one scene, a frustrated Tom Cruise angrily jumps up and down on a couch while Oprah Winfrey sits next to him. This is a reference to an [[Jumping the couch|incident on ''The Oprah Winfrey Show'']] in 2005, in which Cruise repeatedly jumped on the couch next to Oprah, fell to one knee and loudly professed his love for actress [[Katie Holmes]]. Cruise has been repeatedly mocked for his behavior. In another scene, George Lucas and Steven Spielberg are shown to have actor [[Harrison Ford]] leashed, chained and ball-gagged, as the actor wears the fedora he wore in the [[Indiana Jones]] films. This is a reference to the [[South Park (season 12)|twelfth season]] episode \"[[The China Probrem]]\", in which Lucas and Spielberg literally rape Indiana Jones repeatedly, which served as a commentary by Parker and Stone for the poor quality of the 2008 Spielberg/Lucas film, ''[[Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull]]''.<ref name=\"EW0415\" /> A cartoon image of film director [[Tim Burton]] is featured in the episode, despite having not been previously ridiculed by the show. In the episode, Burton is mocked for not having an original idea since the 1988 comedy horror film ''[[Beetlejuice]]'', and for his tendency to feature film actor [[Johnny Depp]] in so many of his films that he should \"just have sex with him [Johnny Depp] already\".<ref name=\"AVClub\" /> Cartman's Jennifer Lopez hand-puppet repeatedly demands food from the American restaurant chain [[Taco Bell]], particularly [[enchirito]]s, which is one of the many Hispanic stereotypes utilized by the character.<ref name=\"AVClub\" />  Also, when the celebrities are discussing whom to bring in to help capture Mohammed, Barbra Streisand is referenced as \"her,\" to which the discussion goes \"her who?\" \"her\" \"oh...her.\"  This is slightly reminiscent of the movie [[Little Shop of Horrors (film)|Little Shop of Horrors]] when Rick Moranis and Steve Martin are talking about Audrey, who the dentist had physically abused, where Steve asks \"what did I ever do to you\" and Rick answers \"it wasn't what you did to me, it was what you did to her\" Steve: \"her? oh...her\" {{citation needed|date=January 2012}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.script-o-rama.com/movie_scripts/l/little-shop-of-horrors-script.html |title=Little Shop Of Horrors Script \u2013  transcript from the screenplay and/or Rick Moranis and Steve Martin musical movie based on the play |publisher=Script-o-rama.com |date= |accessdate=June 11, 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131010042820/http://www.script-o-rama.com/movie_scripts/l/little-shop-of-horrors-script.html|archivedate=October 10, 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Ratings===\nIn its original American broadcast on April 14, 2010, \"200\" was watched by 3.33 million viewers, according to [[Nielsen ratings|Nielsen Media Research]], making it the most watched cable television show of the night.<ref name=\"TVNum\">{{cite news|url=http://tvbythenumbers.com/2010/04/01/wednesday-cable-real-world-hits-lows-south-park-stays-high-in-plain-sight-returns/47093 |title=Wednesday Cable Ratings: \"''In Plain Sight''\" Slips; \"''South Park''\" Up |work=TV by the Numbers |last=Gorman |first=Bill |date=April 15, 2010 |accessdate=April 16, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100407191725/http://tvbythenumbers.com/2010/04/01/wednesday-cable-real-world-hits-lows-south-park-stays-high-in-plain-sight-returns/47093 |archivedate=April 7, 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref> It outperformed the previous week's episode, \"[[You Have 0 Friends]]\", which was seen by 3.07 million viewers,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://tvbythenumbers.com/2010/04/08/wednesday-finals-csi-ny-dips-further-south-park-in-plain-sight-and-more/47783 |title=Wednesday Finals: \"''CSI: NY''\" Dips Further + \"''South Park'',\" \"''In Plain Sight''\" and More |work=TV by the Numbers |last=Seidman |first=Robert |date=April 8, 2010 |accessdate=April 16, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100414163049/http://tvbythenumbers.com/2010/04/08/wednesday-finals-csi-ny-dips-further-south-park-in-plain-sight-and-more/47783 |archivedate=April 14, 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref> and it was seen by roughly 177,000 more viewers than its closest competitor on April 14, [[USA Network]]'s ''[[In Plain Sight]]''.

It originally aired on [[Comedy Central]] in the United States on April 14, 2010. In the episode, [[Tom Cruise]] and all other celebrities who have been mocked by residents of South Park in the past plan to file a [[class action]] lawsuit against the town, but Cruise promises to end the lawsuit if the town can get the [[Islamic]] prophet [[Muhammad]] to meet him.\n\nThe episode was written and directed by series co-creator [[Trey Parker]]. To celebrate their landmark episode, Parker and fellow series co-creator [[Matt Stone]] combined many of ''South Park''{{'}}s past storylines and controversies. The Muhammad subplot, similar to the one previously featured in the [[South Park (season 10)|season 10]] episode \"[[Cartoon Wars Part II|Cartoon Wars]]\", refers to Comedy Central's past refusal to allow [[Depictions of Muhammad|images of Muhammad]] to be shown on the network in response to the riots and threats generated from controversial cartoons in [[Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy|2005]] and [[Lars Vilks Muhammad drawings controversy|2007]] of Muhammad in European newspapers.\n\n\"200\" includes many celebrities that have been mocked in previous episodes, including Cruise, [[Rob Reiner]], [[Steven Spielberg]], [[Kanye West]], [[Paris Hilton]], [[George Lucas]], [[Mel Gibson]] and [[Barbra Streisand]]. An additional subplot includes Cartman learning he may not know the true identity of his father. The 1998 [[South Park (season 2)|season 2]] episode \"[[Cartman's Mom Is Still a Dirty Slut]]\" claimed that Cartman's [[hermaphrodite]] [[Liane Cartman|mother]] is his father, but the events of \"200\" and [[201 (South Park)|the subsequent episode]] reveal that this is not the case.\n\n\"200\" received mostly positive reviews. According to [[Nielsen ratings|Nielsen Media Research]], the episode was seen by 3.33 million viewers, making it the most watched cable television program of the night. Both \"200\" and the sequel episode \"[[201 (South Park)|201]]\" were nominated for the [[Primetime Emmy Award]] for Outstanding Animated Program in 2010.<ref name='2010emmy'>{{cite web|url=http://www.emmys.com/sites/emmys.com/files/62ndemmys_noms.pdf |title=Complete Emmy listings |accessdate=November 26, 2014 |last=Emmy Awards |format=PDF |publisher=Emmy Award |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/65blzi3QZ?url=http://www.emmys.com/sites/emmys.com/files/62ndemmys_noms.pdf |archivedate=February 21, 2012 |url-status=dead |df=mdy }}</ref>\nWithin a week of the episode's original broadcast date, the website for the radical Muslim organization [[Revolution Muslim]] posted an entry warning Parker and Stone that they risked being murdered for airing the episode, which several media outlets and observers interpreted as a threat. As a result, Comedy Central heavily censored portions of \"201\" by removing references to Muhammad and the episode's closing speech. The episode was rated [[TV-MA L]] in the United States. \n\n==Plot==\nWhile on a school [[field trip]] to a [[candy]] factory, [[Butters Stotch|Butters]] spots actor [[Tom Cruise]] working there, packing fudge into boxes. [[Stan Marsh|Stan]], who previously told Cruise that his acting is not as good as others' in \"[[Trapped in the Closet (South Park)|Trapped in the Closet]]\", accidentally insults him again by calling him a \"[[:wikt:fudge packer|fudge packer]]\", as Cruise claims to be [[fly fishing]]. Cruise then recruits 200 other celebrities who have been ridiculed by the town of South Park to bring a [[class action]] lawsuit against the town. Stan returns to the factory with his father [[Randy and Sharon Marsh|Randy]] to try to apologize and convince Cruise to drop the suit, but also finds it difficult not to call him a fudge packer as well since he was literally packing fudge while they spoke. An angry Cruise agrees to do so, but only if they can help Cruise meet [[Muhammad]]. This causes an uproar because [[depictions of Muhammad]] are forbidden, and the townsfolk fear that forcing Muhammad to appear in public will drive Muslim radicals to bomb the town. Stan and Kyle go to the [[Super Best Friends]], a squad of superhero-like religious figures ([[Jesus Christ]], [[Gautama Buddha]], [[Moses]], [[Krishna]], [[Laozi]], [[Joseph Smith]]) of which Muhammad is a member, to request he return with them to South Park. Meanwhile, it is revealed that Cruise and the other celebrities only want Muhammad for his \"goo\", as [[Rob Reiner]], previously shown to be filled with \"goo\" in \"[[Butt Out]]\", has invented a machine to transfer Muhammad's \"goo\" to the celebrities, which they believe will make them immune to ridicule, just like Muhammad.\n\nBy this time, [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]] arrives with \"Mitch Conner\", a face painted on his hand as one-half of a [[ventriloquism|ventriloquist act]]. Previously, Connor had successfully impersonated actress [[Jennifer Lopez]] in \"[[Fat Butt and Pancake Head]]\", and now Cartman and Connor return to the Lopez imitation in order to get involved in the lawsuit along with the other celebrities. Connor soon secretly convinces Cartman that they should steal Muhammad's goo for themselves to sell on the black market for more than the lawsuit could offer. Meanwhile, Kyle and Stan convince the Super Best Friends to let Muhammad come to town, but only if he stays in the back of a [[U-Haul]] truck and is not seen. When the townspeople realize they must bring Muhammad to Cruise's limo, they allegedly put him inside a bear mascot outfit. South Park is about to give Muhammad to the celebrities when the exchange is interrupted by a bomb planted by the [[Ginger Kids]], a group of fair-skinned, red-haired children who are tired of being made fun of for their physical appearance.  The Gingers want Muhammad for themselves, hoping to use his goo for their own means. They threaten to blow up the town if Muhammad is not turned over to them.\n\nThe people of South Park decide to turn Muhammad over to the Gingers, fearing the violence that will befall their town if they do not. The celebrities are angered by this change in events, but refuse to resort to violence for fear of ruining their careers. Instead, the celebrities decide to awaken the rebuilt [[Mecha-Streisand]], a giant mechanical monster form of [[Barbra Streisand]], who previously terrorized the town of South Park before being destroyed. The celebrities hope to use Mecha-Streisand to force South Park to accept their demands. Meanwhile, due to the chain of events, Cartman decides Connor's scheme has become too complicated and tries to quit, but Connor convinces him to stay involved by revealing that the townspeople of South Park have lied to Cartman about his true father. Although they previously claimed his [[hermaphrodite|hermaphroditic]] [[Liane Cartman|mother]] was also his father, Connor insists this is a lie. Cartman confronts his school teacher [[Mr. Garrison]] and Garrison's old hand puppet [[Mr. Hat]], who admits to Cartman there was indeed a cover-up. Mecha-Streisand roars threateningly and continues her reign of destruction as the episode ends.\n\n==Production==\n{{Quote box |quoted=true |bgcolor=#FFFFF0 |salign=center |width=200px |align=right | quote = We kind of came up with the idea of, like, let's take our sort of most popular moments in the show and then put them all together and write them into a new show.

This is a reference to Streisand's appearance in the first-season episode \"[[Mecha-Streisand]]\", in which she transforms into a monster in the style of [[Mechagodzilla]] from the [[Godzilla (franchise)|Godzilla franchise]]. The Mecha-Streisand featured in \"200\" is designed with more sophisticated computer imagery than the original, which was a simple cut-out style cartoon like the rest of ''South Park''.<ref name=\"AVClub\" /><ref name=\"IGN\" /> Although Parker and Stone have maintained that most of the celebrities they mock in ''South Park'' are chosen at random, with no personal animosity behind it, Barbra Streisand is one of the few they actively and vehemently dislike.<ref>{{cite video | people=[[Trey Parker|Parker, Trey]] |date=2003|title=South Park: The Complete First Season: \"Mecha-Streisand\"|type=Audio commentary CD |publisher=Comedy Central}}</ref> Streisand, in turn, has been critical of ''South Park'' and her portrayal in it, and has accused the show of adding \"to the cynicism and negativity in our culture, especially in children\".<ref name=\"Mirabella\">{{cite news|title=The Way She Is|last=Dreifus|first=Claudia|authorlink=Claudia Dreifus|date=May 1998|work=[[Hachette Filipacchi M\u00e9dias]]}}</ref>\n\n===Cartman's father===\nThe episode ends with a [[cliffhanger]] involving Cartman's father.<ref name=\"IGN\" /><ref name=\"WCAU\" /> The identity of Cartman's father made up a major plot point at the end of the [[South Park (season 1)|first season]], culminating in the [[South Park (season 2)|second season]] episode \"[[Cartman's Mom Is Still a Dirty Slut]]\", in which it is revealed Cartman's mother, [[Liane Cartman]], is a [[hermaphrodite]] and, in fact, is Cartman's father. \"200\" is the first episode to return to the matter and suggest this was not the actual truth.<ref name=\"EW0415\" /> Throughout the episode, Cartman uses a hand-puppet con-artist named Mitch Conner, who had, presumably, just been made up by Cartman in trying to fool Kyle in the seventh-season episode \"[[Fat Butt and Pancake Head]]\", resuming his role in pretending to be [[Jennifer Lopez]] and utilizing many offensive [[Hispanic]] stereotypes in his portrayal of her.<ref name=\"AVClub\" /><ref name=\"IGN\" /> The hand puppet portrayal is very similar to the work of Spanish ventriloquist [[Se\u00f1or Wences]].<ref name=\"EW0415\" />\n\nSeveral other references to previous ''South Park'' episodes are featured throughout \"200\". It marks the reappearance of [[Herbert Garrison#Mr. Hat|Mr. Hat]], a hand puppet that had been frequently used by Mr. Garrison during the early ''South Park'' seasons, but had long been abandoned in later episodes.<ref name=\"IGN\" /><ref name=\"EW0415\" /> During the second half of \"200\", an army of red-haired \"ginger kids\" attempt to capture Muhammad themselves. Several ''South Park'' episodes, most prominently the ninth-season episode \"[[Ginger Kids]]\", have featured the ginger kids, which are children with fair skin, freckles and red hair. In most cases, they have been made the subject of ridicule by Cartman, who views them in an offensively stereotypical way.<ref name=\"EW0415\" /><ref>{{cite news |work=[[Metro (Associated Metro Limited)|Metro]] |title=Celebrating South Park's 200 episode: Five of the best |date=April 15, 2010 |url=http://www.metro.co.uk/news/821914-celebrating-south-parks-200-episode-five-of-the-best |accessdate=April 15, 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100418210433/http://www.metro.co.uk/news/821914-celebrating-south-parks-200-episode-five-of-the-best| archivedate=April 18, 2010 | url-status= live}}</ref>\n\n==Cultural references==\nDuring one scene, a frustrated Tom Cruise angrily jumps up and down on a couch while Oprah Winfrey sits next to him. This is a reference to an [[Jumping the couch|incident on ''The Oprah Winfrey Show'']] in 2005, in which Cruise repeatedly jumped on the couch next to Oprah, fell to one knee and loudly professed his love for actress [[Katie Holmes]]. Cruise has been repeatedly mocked for his behavior. In another scene, George Lucas and Steven Spielberg are shown to have actor [[Harrison Ford]] leashed, chained and ball-gagged, as the actor wears the fedora he wore in the [[Indiana Jones]] films. This is a reference to the [[South Park (season 12)|twelfth season]] episode \"[[The China Probrem]]\", in which Lucas and Spielberg literally rape Indiana Jones repeatedly, which served as a commentary by Parker and Stone for the poor quality of the 2008 Spielberg/Lucas film, ''[[Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull]]''.<ref name=\"EW0415\" /> A cartoon image of film director [[Tim Burton]] is featured in the episode, despite having not been previously ridiculed by the show. In the episode, Burton is mocked for not having an original idea since the 1988 comedy horror film ''[[Beetlejuice]]'', and for his tendency to feature film actor [[Johnny Depp]] in so many of his films that he should \"just have sex with him [Johnny Depp] already\".<ref name=\"AVClub\" /> Cartman's Jennifer Lopez hand-puppet repeatedly demands food from the American restaurant chain [[Taco Bell]], particularly [[enchirito]]s, which is one of the many Hispanic stereotypes utilized by the character.<ref name=\"AVClub\" />  Also, when the celebrities are discussing whom to bring in to help capture Mohammed, Barbra Streisand is referenced as \"her,\" to which the discussion goes \"her who?\" \"her\" \"oh...her.\"  This is slightly reminiscent of the movie [[Little Shop of Horrors (film)|Little Shop of Horrors]] when Rick Moranis and Steve Martin are talking about Audrey, who the dentist had physically abused, where Steve asks \"what did I ever do to you\" and Rick answers \"it wasn't what you did to me, it was what you did to her\" Steve: \"her? oh...her\" {{citation needed|date=January 2012}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.script-o-rama.com/movie_scripts/l/little-shop-of-horrors-script.html |title=Little Shop Of Horrors Script \u2013  transcript from the screenplay and/or Rick Moranis and Steve Martin musical movie based on the play |publisher=Script-o-rama.com |date= |accessdate=June 11, 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131010042820/http://www.script-o-rama.com/movie_scripts/l/little-shop-of-horrors-script.html|archivedate=2013-10-10}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Ratings===\nIn its original American broadcast on April 14, 2010, \"200\" was watched by 3.33 million viewers, according to [[Nielsen ratings|Nielsen Media Research]], making it the most watched cable television show of the night.<ref name=\"TVNum\">{{cite news|url=http://tvbythenumbers.com/2010/04/01/wednesday-cable-real-world-hits-lows-south-park-stays-high-in-plain-sight-returns/47093 |title=Wednesday Cable Ratings: \"''In Plain Sight''\" Slips; \"''South Park''\" Up |work=TV by the Numbers |last=Gorman |first=Bill |date=April 15, 2010 |accessdate=April 16, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100407191725/http://tvbythenumbers.com/2010/04/01/wednesday-cable-real-world-hits-lows-south-park-stays-high-in-plain-sight-returns/47093 |archivedate=April 7, 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref> It outperformed the previous week's episode, \"[[You Have 0 Friends]]\", which was seen by 3.07 million viewers,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://tvbythenumbers.com/2010/04/08/wednesday-finals-csi-ny-dips-further-south-park-in-plain-sight-and-more/47783 |title=Wednesday Finals: \"''CSI: NY''\" Dips Further + \"''South Park'',\" \"''In Plain Sight''\" and More |work=TV by the Numbers |last=Seidman |first=Robert |date=April 8, 2010 |accessdate=April 16, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100414163049/http://tvbythenumbers.com/2010/04/08/wednesday-finals-csi-ny-dips-further-south-park-in-plain-sight-and-more/47783 |archivedate=April 14, 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref> and it was seen by roughly 177,000 more viewers than its closest competitor on April 14, [[USA Network]]'s ''[[In Plain Sight]]''.

Therefore, Burnett decided to end the series on her own rather than be canceled later.\n\nThe celebrities in the audience for the final episode included [[Bernadette Peters]], [[Betty White]] and then-husband [[Allen Ludden]], [[Roddy McDowall]], [[Jim Nabors]] and screen legend [[Lillian Gish]].\n\n''The Carol Burnett Show'' was one of the longest-running variety shows in television history; its conclusion marked the closing of another chapter in television as Burnett was the last of the great comedic talents heading a variety show, and hers was the last offering live entertainment before an audience.\n\n==Featured segments==\n*Introduction: [[Q&A]] (Carol Burnett)\n*Duets: [[Liza Minnelli]], [[Ella Fitzgerald]], [[Perry Como]], [[Ray Charles]], [[Bing Crosby]], [[Rock Hudson]], [[Steve Lawrence]] and [[Eydie Gorm\u00e9]]\n*\"[[As Time Goes By (song)|As Time Goes By]]\" ([[Burt Reynolds]])\n*\"[[Mrs. Wiggins]]\" \u2013 ''Flashbacks'' (Carol Burnett, Tim Conway and Vicki Lawrence) \n*\"[[Ragtime Cowboy Joe]]\" ([[James Stewart]])\n*Water Gimmicks:\n**\"[[They Call the Wind Maria]]\" ([[Harvey Korman]])\n**\"[[Come Rain or Come Shine]]\" (Carol Burnett)\n*Solo Montage:\n**\"[[The Lady Is a Tramp]]\" (Carol Burnett)\n**\"[[You Light Up My Life (song)|You Light Up My Life]]\" (Carol Burnett)\n*Movie Parodies:\n**''[[The African Queen (film)|The African Queen]]'' (Carol Burnett and Steve Lawrence)\n**''[[The Postman Always Rings Twice (1946 film)|The Postman Always Rings Twice]]'' (Carol Burnett, Harvey Korman and Steve Lawrence)\n*\"The Doily Sisters\" (Carol Burnett and Vicki Lawrence)\n*Favorite Moments:\n**\"[[The Night the Lights Went Out in Georgia]]\" (Vicki Lawrence)\n**\"S-P-L-I-T\" (Vicki Lawrence)\n**\"The Brown Derby\" (Carol Burnett, Bing Crosby and [[Bob Hope]])\n**\"Newscaster\" (Tim Conway)\n**\"Cobumble\" \u2013 a spoof of ''[[Columbo]]'' (Tim Conway)\n**\"Hand Insurance\" (Carol Burnett and [[Dick Van Dyke]])\n*\"[[The Family (sketch)|The Family]]\" \u2013 ''The Psychiatrist'' (Carol Burnett, Vicki Lawrence and [[Craig Richard Nelson]])\n*Scrapbook: \"[[Salsoul Orchestra|Magic Bird of Fire]]\" (The Ernie Flatt Dancers)\n*Bloopers and Outtakes\n*\"The Charwoman\" (Carol Burnett) \n*Finale: \"I'm So Glad We Had This Time Together\" (Carol Burnett)\n\n==DVD release==\nOn October 3, 2017, [[Time Life]] released ''The Best of The Carol Burnett Show \u2013 The Final Show'' as a single disc [[DVD]] in Region 1 to commemorate the show's 50th anniversary.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Carol Burnett Show - The Final Show|url=http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/releases/Carol-Burnett-Volume-Release/17604}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{imdb episode|0536584}}\n*[https://www.paleycenter.org/collection/item/?q=liza+minnelli+&f=all&c=tv&advanced=1&p=4&item=T80:0730 \"A Special Evening with Carol Burnett\"] at the [[Paley Center for Media]]\n\n{{The Carol Burnett Show}} \n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Special Evening with Carol Burnett, A}}\n[[Category:1978 American television episodes]]\n[[Category:American television series finales]]\n[[Category:Carol Burnett]]\n", "name_user": "Moe1810", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eFeatured segments", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Special_Evening_with_Carol_Burnett"}

He began his career as a stand-up comedian, first entering the national spotlight when he was featured on [[Billy Crystal]]'s first cable TV special. He went on to become a series regular on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC's]] ''[[Fridays (TV series)|Fridays]]''. He made numerous guest appearances on a variety of television shows, such as ''[[Cheers]]''. His film credits include ''[[So I Married an Axe Murderer]]'', ''[[Airheads]]'', ''[[Young Doctors in Love]]'', ''[[Problem Child (1990 film)|Problem Child]]'', ''[[Coneheads (film)|Coneheads]]'', ''[[UHF (film)|UHF]]'', and ''[[Trial and Error (1997 film)|Trial and Error]]'', one of his few starring roles.\n\nFrom 1989 to 1998, he played [[Cosmo Kramer]] on the television sitcom ''[[Seinfeld]]'', receiving the [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series]] three times. During the run of ''Seinfeld'', he made a guest appearance in ''[[Mad About You]]''. After ''Seinfeld'', Richards starred in his own sitcom, ''[[The Michael Richards Show]]'', which lasted less than one full season.\n\nWhen ''Seinfeld'' ended in 1998, Richards returned to stand-up comedy.

In 1980, he began as one of the cast members on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC's]] ''[[Fridays (TV series)|Fridays]]'' television show, where [[Larry David]] was a writer. This included a famous instance in which guest [[Andy Kaufman]] refused to deliver his scripted lines, leading Richards to bring the [[cue card]]s on screen to Kaufman, causing him to throw his drink into Richards's face before a small riot ensued (Richards later claimed he was in on the joke).<ref name=\"fac\">[http://archive.firstamendmentcenter.org/about.aspx?id=12083 Michael Richards 'Speaking Freely' transcript] via [[First Amendment Center]], Recorded February 28, 2002, in Aspen, Colorado {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120331131924/http://archive.firstamendmentcenter.org/about.aspx?id=12083 |date=March 31, 2012 }}</ref> The film ''[[Man on the Moon (film)|Man on the Moon]]'' featured a re-enactment of the [[Fridays (TV series)#Andy Kaufman incident|Andy Kaufman incident]] in which Richards was portrayed by actor [[Norm Macdonald]] (although he is never referred to by name so he could be seen as a composite character taking the place of Richards).<ref>{{cite video|url=http://www.funnyordie.com/videos/544255131b|title=Andy Kaufman on Fridays from FridaysFan|publisher=Funnyordie.com|date=February 11, 2008|accessdate=2010-02-10}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.firstamendmentcenter.org/michael-richards-2|title=Michael Richards \u2013 First Amendment Center \u2013 news, commentary, analysis on free speech, press, religion, assembly, petition|publisher=|access-date=August 29, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140808113050/http://www.firstamendmentcenter.org/michael-richards-2|archive-date=August 8, 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nIn 1989, Richards had a supporting role in [[\"Weird Al\" Yankovic]]'s comedy film ''[[UHF (film)|UHF]]'' as janitor Stanley Spadowski. On television, Richards also appeared in ''[[Miami Vice]]'' (as an unscrupulous [[bookie]]), ''[[Cheers]]'' (as a character trying to collect on an old bet with [[Sam Malone]]), and made several guest appearances with [[Jay Leno]] as an accident-prone fitness expert.\n\nAccording to an interview with executive producer David Hoberman, ABC first conceived the series ''[[Monk (TV series)|Monk]]'' as a procedural police comedy with an [[Inspector Clouseau]]-like character suffering from [[obsessive\u2013compulsive disorder]]. Hoberman said ABC wanted Richards to play [[Adrian Monk]], but he turned it down.<ref>from \"Mr Monk and His Origins,\" a special feature packaged with the Season One DVDs.</ref>\n\n=== ''Seinfeld'' ===\n[[File:Michael Richards Jerry Seinfeld.jpg|thumb|Richards with [[Jerry Seinfeld]] at the [[44th Primetime Emmy Awards]] in 1992]]\n\nIn 1989, he was cast as [[Cosmo Kramer]] in the [[NBC]] television series ''[[Seinfeld]]'', which was created by fellow ''Fridays'' cast member [[Larry David]] and comedian [[Jerry Seinfeld]]. Although it got off to a slow start, by the mid-1990s, the show had become one of the most popular [[Situation comedy|sitcoms]] in television history. The series ended its nine-year run in 1998 at #1 in the [[Nielsen ratings]]. In the setting of ''Seinfeld'', Kramer is usually referred to by his last name only and is the neighbor of the show's [[Jerry Seinfeld (character)|eponymous character]]. Kramer's first name, Cosmo, was revealed in the sixth-season episode \"[[The Switch (Seinfeld)|The Switch]]\".\n\nRichards won more Emmys than any other cast member on ''Seinfeld''. He took home the award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series in 1993, 1994 and 1997.\n\nStarting in 2004, he and his fellow ''Seinfeld'' cast members provided interviews and audio commentaries for the ''Seinfeld'' DVDs, but Richards stopped providing audio commentary after Season{{nbsp}}5 though he continued to provide interviews.\n\n=== ''The Michael Richards Show'' ===\nIn 2000, after the end of ''Seinfeld'', Richards began work on a new series for NBC, his first major project since ''Seinfeld''{{'}}s finale. ''[[The Michael Richards Show]]'', for which the actor received co-writer and co-[[Television producer|executive producer]] credits, was originally conceived as a comedy/mystery starring Richards as a bumbling private investigator. However, after the first pilot failed with test audiences, NBC ordered that the show be retooled into a more conventional, office-based sitcom before its premiere. After a few weeks of poor ratings and negative reviews, it was cancelled.\n\n===2006 Laugh Factory incident ===\nDuring a performance on November 17, 2006, at the [[Laugh Factory]] in [[Hollywood]], [[California]], Richards launched into a [[racism|racist]] rant in response to reported heckling and interruptions from a small group of black audience members. Richards was recorded shouting \"He's a [[nigger]]!\" several times and making references to [[lynching]] and the [[Jim Crow]] era.<ref name=\"TMZ-2006\"/><ref name=\"Vibe\">{{cite web|url=http://www.vibe.com/news/news_headlines/2006/11/comedian_michael_kramer_richards_goes_into_racial_tirade/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061231201005/http://www.vibe.com/news/news_headlines/2006/11/comedian_michael_kramer_richards_goes_into_racial_tirade/|archivedate=December 31, 2006|title=Comedian Michael \"Kramer\" Richards Goes into Racial Tirade, Banned From Laugh Factory|accessdate=2006-11-21|publisher=[[VIBE]].com|year=2006|author=Mariel Concepci\u00f3n|work=News wire}}</ref><ref name=\"washingtonpost.com\">{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/11/21/AR2006112100242.html |title=\"Seinfeld\" Comic Richards Apologizes for Racial Rant |publisher=Washingtonpost.com |date= November 21, 2006|accessdate=2010-10-12}}</ref><ref name=\"Canadian Broadcasting Corporation\">{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/arts/richards-deeply-deeply-sorry-for-racial-slurs-1.618610|title=Richards 'deeply, deeply sorry' for racial slurs|accessdate=2006-11-20|publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]]|work=CBC arts | date=November 20, 2006}}</ref><ref name=\"Reuters-2006\">{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2006/11/20/us-richards-idUSN2041340020061120|title=\"Seinfeld\" Star Richards Under Fire For Racial Outburst|accessdate=2013-06-28|publisher=Reuters|work=News wire|date=November 20, 2006}}</ref> <!-- NOTE TO EDITORS: SEE REMARKS ABOVE THE PRECEDING PARAGRAPH ABOUT CONSENSUS ON THE LAUGH FACTORY INCIDENT, AS IN TALK ARCHIVE 2.

He began his career as a stand-up comedian, first entering the national spotlight when he was featured on [[Billy Crystal]]'s first cable TV special. He went on to become a series regular on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC's]] ''[[Fridays (TV series)|Fridays]]''. He made numerous guest appearances on a variety of television shows, such as ''[[Cheers]]''. His film credits include ''[[So I Married an Axe Murderer]]'', ''[[Airheads]]'', ''[[Young Doctors in Love]]'', ''[[Problem Child (1990 film)|Problem Child]]'', ''[[Coneheads (film)|Coneheads]]'', ''[[UHF (film)|UHF]]'', and ''[[Trial and Error (1997 film)|Trial and Error]]'', one of his few starring roles.\n\nFrom 1989 to 1998, he played [[Cosmo Kramer]] on the television sitcom ''[[Seinfeld]]'', receiving the [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series]] three times. During the run of ''Seinfeld'', he made a guest appearance in ''[[Mad About You]]''. After ''Seinfeld'', Richards starred in his own sitcom, ''[[The Michael Richards Show]]'', which lasted less than one full season.\n\nWhen ''Seinfeld'' ended in 1998, Richards returned to stand-up comedy. He incited media furor while performing at the [[Laugh Factory]] comedy club in late 2006 after a cell phone video was published of him launching into an expletive-laced racist tirade after earlier interruptions from a group of late-arriving audience members.<ref name=\"TMZ-2006\">{{cite web|url=http://www.tmz.com/2006/11/20/kramers-racist-tirade-caught-on-tape|title=\"Kramer's\" Racist Tirade \u2013 Caught on Tape|accessdate=2006-11-20|publisher=TMZ.com|year=2006|author=TMZ Staff|work=In The Zone}}</ref> Subsequently, due to significant media coverage of the event he announced his retirement from stand-up early in 2007. He appeared as himself in the [[Curb Your Enthusiasm Season 7|seventh season]] of ''[[Curb Your Enthusiasm]]'' in 2009, acting alongside his fellow cast members for the first time since ''Seinfeld''{{'}}s [[The Finale (Seinfeld)|finale]], as well as lampooning his incident at the Laugh Factory.

In 1980, he began as one of the cast members on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC's]] ''[[Fridays (TV series)|Fridays]]'' television show, where [[Larry David]] was a writer. This included a famous instance in which guest [[Andy Kaufman]] refused to deliver his scripted lines, leading Richards to bring the [[cue card]]s on screen to Kaufman, causing him to throw his drink into Richards's face before a small riot ensued (Richards later claimed he was in on the joke).<ref name=\"fac\">[http://archive.firstamendmentcenter.org/about.aspx?id=12083 Michael Richards 'Speaking Freely' transcript] via [[First Amendment Center]], Recorded February 28, 2002, in Aspen, Colorado {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120331131924/http://archive.firstamendmentcenter.org/about.aspx?id=12083 |date=March 31, 2012 }}</ref> The film ''[[Man on the Moon (film)|Man on the Moon]]'' featured a re-enactment of the [[Fridays (TV series)#Andy Kaufman incident|Andy Kaufman incident]] in which Richards was portrayed by actor [[Norm Macdonald]] (although he is never referred to by name so he could be seen as a composite character taking the place of Richards).<ref>{{cite video|url=http://www.funnyordie.com/videos/544255131b|title=Andy Kaufman on Fridays from FridaysFan|publisher=Funnyordie.com|date=February 11, 2008|accessdate=2010-02-10}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.firstamendmentcenter.org/michael-richards-2|title=Michael Richards \u2013 First Amendment Center \u2013 news, commentary, analysis on free speech, press, religion, assembly, petition|publisher=|access-date=August 29, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140808113050/http://www.firstamendmentcenter.org/michael-richards-2|archive-date=August 8, 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nIn 1989, Richards had a supporting role in [[\"Weird Al\" Yankovic]]'s comedy film ''[[UHF (film)|UHF]]'' as janitor Stanley Spadowski. On television, Richards also appeared in ''[[Miami Vice]]'' (as an unscrupulous [[bookie]]), ''[[Cheers]]'' (as a character trying to collect on an old bet with [[Sam Malone]]), and made several guest appearances with [[Jay Leno]] as an accident-prone fitness expert.\n\nAccording to an interview with executive producer David Hoberman, ABC first conceived the series ''[[Monk (TV series)|Monk]]'' as a procedural police comedy with an [[Inspector Clouseau]]-like character suffering from [[obsessive\u2013compulsive disorder]]. Hoberman said ABC wanted Richards to play [[Adrian Monk]], but he turned it down.<ref>from \"Mr Monk and His Origins,\" a special feature packaged with the Season One DVDs.</ref>\n\n=== ''Seinfeld'' ===\n[[File:Michael Richards Jerry Seinfeld.jpg|thumb|Richards with [[Jerry Seinfeld]] at the [[44th Primetime Emmy Awards]] in 1992]]\n\nIn 1989, he was cast as [[Cosmo Kramer]] in the [[NBC]] television series ''[[Seinfeld]]'', which was created by fellow ''Fridays'' cast member [[Larry David]] and comedian [[Jerry Seinfeld]]. Although it got off to a slow start, by the mid-1990s, the show had become one of the most popular [[Situation comedy|sitcoms]] in television history. The series ended its nine-year run in 1998 at #1 in the [[Nielsen ratings]]. In the setting of ''Seinfeld'', Kramer is usually referred to by his last name only and is the neighbor of the show's [[Jerry Seinfeld (character)|eponymous character]]. Kramer's first name, Cosmo, was revealed in the sixth-season episode \"[[The Switch (Seinfeld)|The Switch]]\".\n\nRichards won more Emmys than any other cast member on ''Seinfeld''. He took home the award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series in 1993, 1994 and 1997.\n\nStarting in 2004, he and his fellow ''Seinfeld'' cast members provided interviews and audio commentaries for the ''Seinfeld'' DVDs, but Richards stopped providing audio commentary after Season{{nbsp}}5 though he continued to provide interviews.\n\n=== ''The Michael Richards Show'' ===\nIn 2000, after the end of ''Seinfeld'', Richards began work on a new series for NBC, his first major project since ''Seinfeld''{{'}}s finale. ''[[The Michael Richards Show]]'', for which the actor received co-writer and co-[[Television producer|executive producer]] credits, was originally conceived as a comedy/mystery starring Richards as a bumbling private investigator. However, after the first pilot failed with test audiences, NBC ordered that the show be retooled into a more conventional, office-based sitcom before its premiere. After a few weeks of poor ratings and negative reviews, it was cancelled.\n\n===2006 Laugh Factory incident ===\nDuring a performance on November 17, 2006 at the [[Laugh Factory]] in [[Hollywood]], [[California]], Richards launched into a [[racism|racist]] rant in response to reported heckling and interruptions from a small group of black audience members. Richards was recorded shouting \"He's a [[nigger]]!\" several times and making references to [[lynching]] and the [[Jim Crow]] era.<ref name=\"TMZ-2006\"/><ref name=\"Vibe\">{{cite web|url=http://www.vibe.com/news/news_headlines/2006/11/comedian_michael_kramer_richards_goes_into_racial_tirade/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061231201005/http://www.vibe.com/news/news_headlines/2006/11/comedian_michael_kramer_richards_goes_into_racial_tirade/|archivedate=December 31, 2006|title=Comedian Michael \"Kramer\" Richards Goes into Racial Tirade, Banned From Laugh Factory|accessdate=2006-11-21|publisher=[[VIBE]].com|year=2006|author=Mariel Concepci\u00f3n|work=News wire}}</ref><ref name=\"washingtonpost.com\">{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/11/21/AR2006112100242.html |title=\"Seinfeld\" Comic Richards Apologizes for Racial Rant |publisher=Washingtonpost.com |date= November 21, 2006|accessdate=2010-10-12}}</ref><ref name=\"Canadian Broadcasting Corporation\">{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/arts/richards-deeply-deeply-sorry-for-racial-slurs-1.618610|title=Richards 'deeply, deeply sorry' for racial slurs|accessdate=2006-11-20|publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]]|work=CBC arts | date=November 20, 2006}}</ref><ref name=\"Reuters-2006\">{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2006/11/20/us-richards-idUSN2041340020061120|title=\"Seinfeld\" Star Richards Under Fire For Racial Outburst|accessdate=2013-06-28|publisher=Reuters|work=News wire|date=November 20, 2006}}</ref> <!-- NOTE TO EDITORS: SEE REMARKS ABOVE THE PRECEDING PARAGRAPH ABOUT CONSENSUS ON THE LAUGH FACTORY INCIDENT, AS IN TALK ARCHIVE 2.
