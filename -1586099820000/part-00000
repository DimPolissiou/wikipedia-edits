The protest followed the failure of  an effort of the Oglala Sioux Civil Rights Organization (OSCRO) to [[impeach]] tribal president [[Dick Wilson (tribal chairman)|Richard Wilson]], whom they accused of corruption and abuse of opponents. Additionally, protesters criticized the United States government's failure to fulfill treaties with Native American people and demanded the reopening of treaty negotiations to hopefully arrive at fair and equitable treatment of Native Americans.\n\nOglala and AIM activists controlled the town for 71 days while the [[United States Marshals Service]], [[FBI]] agents, and other law enforcement agencies cordoned off the area. The activists chose the site of the 1890 [[Wounded Knee Massacre]] for its symbolic value.

Many of the tribe believed that Wilson, elected tribal chairman in 1972, had rapidly become autocratic and corrupt, controlling too much of the employment and other limited opportunities on the reservation.<ref name=\"CrowDog\">{{cite book |last1=Crow Dog |first1=Mary |title=Lakota Woman |date=1990 |publisher=Grove Weidenfeld |location=New York, NY |isbn=0-8021-1101-7}}</ref> They believed that Wilson favored his family and friends in patronage awards of the limited number of jobs and benefits.  Some criticism addressed the mixed-race ancestry of Wilson and his favorites, and suggested they worked too closely with Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) officials who still had a hand in reservation affairs. Some [[Blood quantum laws|full-blood]] Oglala believed they were not getting fair opportunities.\n\n\"Traditionals\" had their own leaders and influence in a parallel stream to the elected government recognized by the United States. The traditionals tended to be Oglala who held onto their language and customs, and who did not desire to participate in US federal programs administered by the tribal government.\n\nIn his 2007 book on twentieth-century political history of the Pine Ridge Reservation, historian Akim Reinhardt notes the decades-long ethnic and cultural differences among residents at the reservation.  He attributes the Wounded Knee Occupation more to the rising of such internal tensions than to the arrival of AIM, who had been invited to the reservation by OSCRO. He also believes that the [[Indian Reorganization Act of 1934]] did not do enough to reduce U.S. federal government intervention into [[Sioux]] and other tribal affairs; he describes the elected tribal governments since the 1930s as a system of \"indirect colonialism\".<ref name=akim/> Oglala Sioux opposition to such elected governments was longstanding on the reservation; at the same time, the limited two-year tenure of the president's position made it difficult for leaders to achieve much. Officials of the [[Bureau of Indian Affairs]], administrators and police, still had much influence at Pine Ridge and other American Indian reservations, which many tribal members opposed.<ref name=akim>[https://books.google.com/books?id=0OEzAiB8U6EC&pg=PA173&lpg=PA173&dq=Oglala+Sioux+Civil+Rights+Organization+%28OSCRO%29&source=bl&ots=rzJJ9pya80&sig=T8lZELkugTlECAnYPEebKtE82EA&hl=en&ei=rOAJTsCJMsOssAKQnrSyAQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=4&ved=0CCkQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&q=Oglala%20Sioux%20Civil%20Rights%20Organization%20%28OSCRO%29&f=false ''Ruling Pine Ridge: Oglala Lakota Politics from the IRA to Wounded Knee''], Texas Tech University Press, 2007</ref>\n\nSpecifically, opponents of Wilson protested his sale of grazing rights on tribal lands to local white ranchers at too low a rate, reducing income to the tribe as a whole, whose members held the land communally. They also complained of his land-use decision to lease nearly one-eighth of the reservation's mineral-rich lands to private companies. Some full-blood Lakota complained of having been marginalized since the start of the reservation system. Most did not bother to participate in tribal elections, which led to tensions on all sides. There had been increasing violence on the reservation, which many attributed to Wilson's private militia, Guardians of the Oglala Nation (informally called the GOONs), attacking political opponents to suppress opposition. The so-called \u201cGOONs\u201d were initially funded with $62,000 from the BIA to be \u201can auxiliary police force.\"<ref name=\"Churchill\">{{cite book |last1=Churchill |first1=Ward |title=Agents of Repression |date=1988 |publisher=South End Press |location=Cambridge, MA}}</ref>\n\nAnother concern was the failure of the justice systems in border towns to prosecute white attacks against Lakota men who went to the towns for their numerous saloons and bars. Alcohol was prohibited on the reservation.<ref name=\"CrowDog\" /> Local police seldom prosecuted crimes against the Lakota, or charged assailants at lesser levels. Recent murders in border towns heightened concerns on the reservation.  An example was the early 1973 murder of 20-year-old [[Wesley Bad Heart Bull]] in a bar in [[Buffalo Gap, South Dakota|Buffalo Gap]], which the tribe believed was due to his race.  AIM led supporters to a meeting at the [[Custer, South Dakota|Custer]] courthouse, where they expected to discuss [[civil rights]] issues and wanted charges against the suspect raised to murder from second-degree [[Manslaughter (United States law)|manslaughter]]. They were met by riot police, who allowed only five people to enter the courthouse, despite blizzard conditions outside. Reinhardt notes that the confrontation became violent, during which protesters burned down the chamber of commerce building, damaged the courthouse and destroyed two police cars, and vandalized other buildings.<ref name=akim/>\n\nThree weeks before the Wounded Knee Occupation, the tribal council had charged Wilson with several items for an impeachment hearing. However, Wilson was able to avoid a trial, as the prosecution was not ready to proceed immediately, the presiding official would not accept new charges, and the council voted to close the hearings. Charges had been brought by a coalition of local Oglala, grouped loosely around the \"traditionals\", the [[Oglala Sioux Civil Rights Organization]] (OSCRO), and tribal members of the [[American Indian Movement]]. Wilson opponents were angered that he had evaded impeachment. U.S. Marshals offered him and his family protection at a time of heightened tensions and protected the BIA headquarters at the reservation. Wilson added more fortification to the facility.\n\n=== Siege ===\nAfter AIM's confrontation at the Custer courthouse, OSCRO leaders asked AIM for help in dealing with Wilson. <ref name=\"CrowDog\" /> The traditional chiefs and AIM leaders met with the community to discuss how to deal with the deteriorating situation on the reservation. Women elders such as OSCRO founder [[Ellen Moves Camp]], [[Gladys Bissonette]], and Agnes Lamont urged the men to take action.<ref name=\"akim\"/> They decided to make a stand at the hamlet of Wounded Knee, the renowned site of the last large-scale [[Wounded Knee Massacre|massacre]] of the [[American Indian Wars]]. They occupied the town and announced their demand for the removal of Wilson from office and for immediate revival of treaty talks with the U.S. government. [[Dennis Banks]] and [[Russell Means]] were prominent spokesmen during the occupation; they often addressed the press, knowing they were making their cause known directly to the American public. The brothers [[Clyde Bellecourt|Clyde]] and [[Vernon Bellecourt]] were also AIM leaders at the time, who generally operated in [[Minneapolis]].<ref>[http://ww3.startribune.com/blogs/oldnews/archives/186 James Parsons, \"AIM Indians with \u2019story to tell\u2019 made Wounded Knee the medium\"], ''Minneapolis Tribune'', March 25, 1973, posted again on Tribune blog, 2007.

The protest followed the failure of  an effort of the Oglala Sioux Civil Rights Organization (OSCRO) to [[impeach]] tribal president [[Dick Wilson (tribal chairman)|Richard Wilson]], whom they accused of corruption and abuse of opponents. Additionally, protesters criticized the United States government's failure to fulfill treaties with Native American people and demanded the reopening of treaty negotiations to hopefully arrive at fair and equitable treatment of Native Americans.\n\nOglala and AIM activists controlled the town for 71 days while the [[United States Marshals Service]], [[FBI]] agents, and other law enforcement agencies cordoned off the area. The activists chose the site of the 1890 [[Wounded Knee Massacre]] for its symbolic value. In March, a U.S. Marshal was shot by gunfire coming from the town, which ultimately resulted in [[paralysis]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1338&dat=19730327&id=aqhYAAAAIBAJ&sjid=tfgDAAAAIBAJ&pg=6848,3620621&hl=en |title=Marshal Wounded |date=March 27, 1973 |website=[[Spokane Daily Chronicle]] |access-date=January 3, 2016}}</ref> A member of the [[Cherokee]] tribe and a member of the [[Oglala Lakota]] tribe were both killed by shootings in April 1973. [[Perry Ray Robinson|Ray Robinson]], a [[civil rights]] activist who joined the protesters, disappeared during the events and is believed to have been murdered. Due to damage to the houses, the small community was not reoccupied until the 1990s.\n\nThe occupation attracted wide media coverage, especially after the press accompanied the two U.S. senators from South Dakota to Wounded Knee. The events electrified Native Americans, and many Native American supporters traveled to Wounded Knee to join the protest. At the time there was widespread public sympathy for the goals of the occupation, as Americans were becoming more aware of longstanding issues of injustice related to Natives. Afterward AIM leaders [[Dennis Banks]] and [[Russell Means]] were indicted on charges related to the events, but their 1974 case was dismissed by the federal court for prosecutorial misconduct,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://archives.nbclearn.com/portal/site/k-12/flatview?cuecard=37580 |title=Dennis Banks and Russell Means Cleared of Charges |author=News transcript. |date=September 16, 1974 |website=NBCLearn K-12 |publisher=[[NBC]] |accessdate=January 3, 2016 |quote=Judge Nichol, citing misconduct, negligence and even deceit by federal prosecutors and the FBI, dismissed the charges after the eight-month-long case when it was clear his only other choice was to declare a mistrial because the jury couldn't resume deliberations.}}</ref> a decision upheld on appeal.\n\nWilson stayed in office and in 1974 was re-elected amid charges of intimidation, [[Electoral fraud|voter fraud]], and other abuses.  The rate of violence climbed on the reservation as conflict opened between political factions in the following three years; residents accused Wilson's private militia, [[Guardians of the Oglala Nation]] (GOONs), of much of it.  More than 60 opponents of the tribal government died violently during those years, including Pedro Bissonette, director of the Oglala Sioux Civil Rights Organization (OSCRO).<ref>Ward Churchill, ''From a Native Son: Selected Essays on Indigenism, 1985\u20131995'', South End Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts, pages 256\u201360.</ref>\n\n==Occupation==\nOn February 28, 1973, AIM leaders Russell Means (Oglala Sioux) and [[Carter Camp]] ([[Ponca]]), together with 200 activists and [[Oglala Lakota]] (Oglala Sioux) of the [[Pine Ridge Indian Reservation]], including children and the elderly,<ref>{{cite book |last1=Crow Dog |first1=Mary |title=Lakota Woman |date=1990 |publisher=Grove Weidenfeld |location=New York, NY |isbn=0-8021-1101-7 |edition=First}}</ref> who opposed Oglala tribal chairman [[Dick Wilson (tribal chairman)|Richard Wilson]], occupied the town of Wounded Knee in protest against Wilson's administration, as well as against the federal government's persistent failures to honor its treaties with Native American nations.

Retrieved May 10, 2007</ref> By the morning of February 28, both sides began to be entrenched.\n\n=== Background ===\n{{refimprove section|date=February 2017}}\nFor years, internal tribal tensions had been growing over the difficult conditions on the [[Pine Ridge Reservation]], which has been one of the poorest areas in the United States since it was set up. Many of the tribe believed that Wilson, elected tribal chairman in 1972, had rapidly become autocratic and corrupt, controlling too much of the employment and other limited opportunities on the reservation.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Crow Dog |first1=Mary |title=Lakota Woman |date=1990 |publisher=Grove Weidenfeld |location=New York, NY |isbn=0-8021-1101-7}}</ref> They believed that Wilson favored his family and friends in patronage awards of the limited number of jobs and benefits.  Some criticism addressed the mixed-race ancestry of Wilson and his favorites, and suggested they worked too closely with Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) officials who still had a hand in reservation affairs. Some [[Blood quantum laws|full-blood]] Oglala believed they were not getting fair opportunities.\n\n\"Traditionals\" had their own leaders and influence in a parallel stream to the elected government recognized by the United States. The traditionals tended to be Oglala who held onto their language and customs, and who did not desire to participate in US federal programs administered by the tribal government.\n\nIn his 2007 book on twentieth-century political history of the Pine Ridge Reservation, historian Akim Reinhardt notes the decades-long ethnic and cultural differences among residents at the reservation.  He attributes the Wounded Knee Occupation more to the rising of such internal tensions than to the arrival of AIM, who had been invited to the reservation by OSCRO. He also believes that the [[Indian Reorganization Act of 1934]] did not do enough to reduce U.S. federal government intervention into [[Sioux]] and other tribal affairs; he describes the elected tribal governments since the 1930s as a system of \"indirect colonialism\".<ref name=akim/> Oglala Sioux opposition to such elected governments was longstanding on the reservation; at the same time, the limited two-year tenure of the president's position made it difficult for leaders to achieve much. Officials of the [[Bureau of Indian Affairs]], administrators and police, still had much influence at Pine Ridge and other American Indian reservations, which many tribal members opposed.<ref name=akim>[https://books.google.com/books?id=0OEzAiB8U6EC&pg=PA173&lpg=PA173&dq=Oglala+Sioux+Civil+Rights+Organization+%28OSCRO%29&source=bl&ots=rzJJ9pya80&sig=T8lZELkugTlECAnYPEebKtE82EA&hl=en&ei=rOAJTsCJMsOssAKQnrSyAQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=4&ved=0CCkQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&q=Oglala%20Sioux%20Civil%20Rights%20Organization%20%28OSCRO%29&f=false ''Ruling Pine Ridge: Oglala Lakota Politics from the IRA to Wounded Knee''], Texas Tech University Press, 2007</ref>\n\nSpecifically, opponents of Wilson protested his sale of grazing rights on tribal lands to local white ranchers at too low a rate, reducing income to the tribe as a whole, whose members held the land communally. They also complained of his land-use decision to lease nearly one-eighth of the reservation's mineral-rich lands to private companies. Some full-blood Lakota complained of having been marginalized since the start of the reservation system. Most did not bother to participate in tribal elections, which led to tensions on all sides. There had been increasing violence on the reservation, which many attributed to Wilson's private militia, Guardians of the Oglala Nation (informally called the GOONs), attacking political opponents to suppress opposition. The so-called \u201cGOONs\u201d were initially funded with $62,000 from the BIA to be \u201can auxiliary police force.\"<ref>{{cite book |last1=Churchill |first1=Ward |title=Agents of Repression |date=1988 |publisher=South End Press |location=Cambridge, MA}}</ref>\n\nAnother concern was the failure of the justice systems in border towns to prosecute white attacks against Lakota men who went to the towns for their numerous saloons and bars. Alcohol was prohibited on the reservation<ref>{{cite book |last1=Crow Dog |first1=Mary |title=Lakota Woman |date=1990 |publisher=Grove Weidenfeld |location=New York, NY |isbn=0-8021-1101-7}}</ref>. Local police seldom prosecuted crimes against the Lakota, or charged assailants at lesser levels. Recent murders in border towns heightened concerns on the reservation.  An example was the early 1973 murder of 20-year-old [[Wesley Bad Heart Bull]] in a bar in [[Buffalo Gap, South Dakota|Buffalo Gap]], which the tribe believed was due to his race.  AIM led supporters to a meeting at the [[Custer, South Dakota|Custer]] courthouse, where they expected to discuss [[civil rights]] issues and wanted charges against the suspect raised to murder from second-degree [[Manslaughter (United States law)|manslaughter]]. They were met by riot police, who allowed only five people to enter the courthouse, despite blizzard conditions outside. Reinhardt notes that the confrontation became violent, during which protesters burned down the chamber of commerce building, damaged the courthouse and destroyed two police cars, and vandalized other buildings.<ref name=akim/>\n\nThree weeks before the Wounded Knee Occupation, the tribal council had charged Wilson with several items for an impeachment hearing. However, Wilson was able to avoid a trial, as the prosecution was not ready to proceed immediately, the presiding official would not accept new charges, and the council voted to close the hearings. Charges had been brought by a coalition of local Oglala, grouped loosely around the \"traditionals\", the [[Oglala Sioux Civil Rights Organization]] (OSCRO), and tribal members of the [[American Indian Movement]]. Wilson opponents were angered that he had evaded impeachment. U.S. Marshals offered him and his family protection at a time of heightened tensions and protected the BIA headquarters at the reservation. Wilson added more fortification to the facility.\n\n=== Siege ===\nAfter AIM\u2019s confrontation at the Custer courthouse, OSCRO leaders asked AIM for help in dealing with Wilson. <ref>{{cite book |last1=Crow Dog |first1=Mary |title=Lakota Woman |date=1990 |publisher=Grove Weidenfeld |location=New York, NY |isbn=0-8021-1101-7}}</ref> The traditional chiefs and AIM leaders met with the community to discuss how to deal with the deteriorating situation on the reservation. Women elders such as OSCRO founder [[Ellen Moves Camp]], [[Gladys Bissonette]], and Agnes Lamont urged the men to take action.<ref name=\"akim\"/> They decided to make a stand at the hamlet of Wounded Knee, the renowned site of the last large-scale [[Wounded Knee Massacre|massacre]] of the [[American Indian Wars]]. They occupied the town and announced their demand for the removal of Wilson from office and for immediate revival of treaty talks with the U.S. government. [[Dennis Banks]] and [[Russell Means]] were prominent spokesmen during the occupation; they often addressed the press, knowing they were making their cause known directly to the American public. The brothers [[Clyde Bellecourt|Clyde]] and [[Vernon Bellecourt]] were also AIM leaders at the time, who generally operated in [[Minneapolis]].<ref>[http://ww3.startribune.com/blogs/oldnews/archives/186 James Parsons, \"AIM Indians with \u2019story to tell\u2019 made Wounded Knee the medium\"], ''Minneapolis Tribune'', March 25, 1973, posted again on Tribune blog, 2007.

However, actor [[Marlon Brando]], an AIM supporter, asked [[Sacheen Littlefeather]], an [[Apache]] actress, to speak at the [[45th Academy Awards]] on his behalf, as he had been nominated for his performance in ''[[The Godfather]]''. She appeared at the ceremony in traditional Apache clothing. When his name was announced as the winner, she said that he declined the award due to the \"poor treatment of Native Americans in the film industry\" in an improvised speech as she was told she could not give the original speech given to her by Brando and was warned that she would be physically taken off and arrested if she was on stage for more than a minute. Afterwards, she read his original words about Wounded Knee backstage to many of the press. This recaptured the attention of millions in the United States and world media. AIM supporters and participants thought Littlefeather's speech to be a major victory for their movement.<ref>Rampell, Ed (2005).

Special Agent in Charge at the time, Joseph Trimbach, has argued that AIM used federal funds to purchase weaponry, rather than aid the American Indian people. <ref>{{cite book |last1=Trimbach |first1=Joseph |title=American Indian Mafia |date=2007 |publisher=Outskirts Press}}</ref> Trimbach and others have also suggested that AIM members murdered Anna Mae Aquash because they thought she was a spy. <ref>{{cite book |last1=Trimbach |first1=Joseph |title=American Indian Mafia |date=2007 |publisher=Outskirts Press}}</ref> Even individuals within the movement, such as Mary Crow Dog, have been critical of AIM.

Subsequently, the commissioner has also investigated a separate incident surrounding her use of threatening language to a journalist.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm5801/cmselect/cmstandards/210/21003.htm|title=Kate Osamor - Committee on Standards - House of Commons|website=publications.parliament.uk}}</ref>\n\nIn a letter dated 8 October 2018, Osamor wrote to the Courts of Justice, Bournemouth, to provide a character reference for her son. The letter was hand-delivered at the court and was written on House of Commons stationery bearing the crowned portcullis, the royal badge used as an emblem by the House of Commons. In the letter Osamor referred to herself as the \"Member of Parliament for Edmonton and Shadow Secretary of State for International Development\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm5801/cmselect/cmstandards/210/21003.htm#footnote-036|title=Kate Osamor - Committee on Standards - House of Commons|website=publications.parliament.uk}}</ref>\n\nThe Commissioner noted that \u201cthe use of House of Commons paper wrongly suggested that her plea carried the authority of the House\u201d. She comments that the tone of any character reference for a constituent would be different from that which Ms Osamor used to plead her son\u2019s cause. The Commissioner concludes that \u201cwriting, in the terms that she did, on stationery bearing the royal badge was, in my view, highly inappropriate\u201d. She therefore finds that in writing to the judge on House-provided stationery, Ms Osamor broke the rules on the use of such stationery, in breach of paragraph 16 of the Code of Conduct.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm5801/cmselect/cmstandards/210/21003.htm#footnote-026|title=Kate Osamor - Committee on Standards - House of Commons|website=publications.parliament.uk}}</ref> Osamor has accepted that she broke the rules on the use of House-provided stationery, and has apologised to the Commissioner.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm5801/cmselect/cmstandards/210/21003.htm#footnote-025|title=Kate Osamor - Committee on Standards - House of Commons|website=publications.parliament.uk}}</ref>\n\nOn the second matter: on 30 November 2018, police officers had attended Osamor's home after a call from Osamor stating \"a man claiming to be a journalist was banging on the door intimidating her and her family\". Osamor conceded to the Commissioner she had been at home alone at the time.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm5801/cmselect/cmstandards/210/21003.htm#footnote-024|title=Kate Osamor - Committee on Standards - House of Commons|website=publications.parliament.uk}}</ref>\n\nBased on body worn video evidence provided by the police, the Commissioner established that Osamor had said \u201cDon\u2019t knock my fucking door. I should have come down here with a fucking bat and smashed your face open\u201d to the journalist in the presence of the attending police officers.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nThe Commissioner's overall finding was that Osamor\u2019s actions in writing to the court using House-provided stationery, in speaking as she did to the journalist was found to be a breach of paragraph 17 of the Code of Conduct.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm5801/cmselect/cmstandards/210/21003.htm#footnote-014|title=Kate Osamor -
