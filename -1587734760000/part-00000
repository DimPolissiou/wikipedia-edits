Goldblith Career Development Professor in the Picower Institute for Learning and Memory (http://picower.mit.edu/) at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]. Choi is known for elucidating the role of the [[immune system]] in the development of [[Autism spectrum|autism spectrum disorder]]-like phenotypes. Her lab currently explores how sensory experiences drive internal states and behavioral outcomes through probing the olfactory system as well as the neuroimmune system.\n\n== Early Life and Education ==\nChoi was born in [[South Korea]] and immigrated to America in her teenage years.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://picower.mit.edu/news/new-faculty-member-studies-immune-system-effect-brain|title=New faculty member studies immune system effect on the brain|website=picower.mit.edu|language=en|access-date=2020-04-15}}</ref> Her family settled in [[Southern California]], where Choi developed a liking and interest in math and science because these subjects were easier to grasp while she was adjusting to the language barrier.<ref name=\":0\" /> Choi especially took a liking to biology throughout high school and continued to pursue biological studies at the [[University of California, Berkeley]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://bcs.mit.edu/users/gbchoimitedu|title=Brain and Cognitive Sciences|website=bcs.mit.edu|language=en|access-date=2020-04-15}}</ref>\n\nSince Choi had an early interest in applications of her studies, she joined the lab of [[Richard Harland (biologist)|Richard Harland]] to conduct laboratory research in molecular and cellular biology.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Mariani|first=F.

Because of their small body mass, it is easy for them to take in a large amount of water relative to body mass and total body [[sodium]] stores.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stlouischildrens.org/content/healthinfo/WaterIntoxicationinInfants.htm|title=Water Intoxication in Infants|publisher=|accessdate=31 August 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Endurance sports===\n[[Marathon]] [[running|runners]] are susceptible to water intoxication if they drink too much while running.  This is caused when sodium levels drop below 135&nbsp;mmol/L when athletes consume large amounts of fluid. This has been noted to be the result of the encouragement of excessive fluid replacement by various guidelines. This has largely been identified in marathon runners as a dilutional [[hyponatremia]].<ref name = \"NEJMed1\">{{cite journal  |vauthors=Almond CS, Shin AY, Fortescue EB, etal |title=Hyponatremia among runners in the Boston Marathon |journal=The New England Journal of Medicine |volume=352 |issue=15 |pages=1550\u20136 |date=April 2005  |pmid=15829535 |doi=10.1056/NEJMoa043901|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/1dd20ec1e1d0562b0a679e5216cc30823121a399 }}</ref> A study conducted on participants of the 2002 Boston Marathon found that thirteen percent finished the race with hyponatremia. The study concluded that the strongest predictor of hyponatremia was weight gain while racing (over-hydration), and hyponatremia was just as likely to occur in runners who chose sports drinks as those who chose water.<ref name = \"NEJMed1\"/> Medical personnel at marathon events are trained to suspect water intoxication immediately when runners collapse or show signs of confusion.\n\n===Overexertion and heat stress===\nAny activity or situation that promotes heavy sweating can lead to water intoxication when water is consumed to replace lost fluids. Persons working in extreme heat and/or humidity for long periods must take care to drink and eat in ways that help to maintain electrolyte balance.  People using drugs such as [[MDMA]] (often referred to colloquially as \"Ecstasy\") may overexert themselves, perspire heavily, feel increased thirst, and then drink large amounts of water to rehydrate, leading to electrolyte imbalance and water intoxication \u2013 this is compounded by MDMA use increasing the levels of antidiuretic hormone (ADH), decreasing the amount of water lost through urination.<ref>{{cite book |first=John |last=Timbrell |title=The Poison Paradox: Chemicals as Friends and Foes |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qYYOtQU37jcC |year=2005 |publisher=OUP Oxford |isbn=978-0-19-280495-2}}</ref>  Even people who are resting quietly in extreme heat or humidity may run the risk of water intoxication if they drink large amounts of water over short periods for rehydration.\n\n===Psychiatric conditions===\n[[Psychogenic polydipsia]] is the psychiatric condition in which patients feel compelled to drink large quantities of water, thus putting them at risk of water intoxication.

This causes the cells to swell. In the brain, this swelling increases [[intracranial pressure]] (ICP), which leads to the first observable symptoms of water intoxication: headache, personality changes, changes in behavior, confusion, irritability, and drowsiness. These are sometimes followed by difficulty breathing during exertion, muscle weakness & pain, twitching, or cramping, nausea, vomiting, thirst, and a dulled ability to perceive and interpret sensory information. As the condition persists, papillary and vital signs may result including [[bradycardia]] and widened [[pulse pressure]]. The cells in the brain may swell to the point where blood flow is interrupted resulting in [[cerebral edema]]. Swollen brain cells may also apply [[Brain herniation|pressure to the brain stem]] causing central nervous system dysfunction. Both cerebral edema and interference with the central nervous system are dangerous and could result in seizures, brain damage, coma or death.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Moreau|first1=David|title=Fluids & Electrolytes Made Incredibly Easy!|date=2008|publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins|location=Philadelphia|isbn=978-1582555652|pages=75\u201377|edition=4th}}</ref>\n\n==Prevention==\nWater intoxication can be prevented if a person's intake of water does not grossly exceed their losses.

Because of their small body mass, it is easy for them to take in a large amount of water relative to body mass and total body [[sodium]] stores.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stlouischildrens.org/content/healthinfo/WaterIntoxicationinInfants.htm|title=Water Intoxication in Infants|publisher=|accessdate=31 August 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Endurance sports===\n[[Marathon]] [[running|runners]] are susceptible to water intoxication if they drink too much while running.  This is caused when sodium levels drop below 135&nbsp;mmol/L when athletes consume large amounts of fluid. This has been noted to be the result of the encouragement of excessive fluid replacement by various guidelines. This has largely been identified in marathon runners as a dilutional [[hyponatremia]].<ref name = \"NEJMed1\">{{cite journal  |vauthors=Almond CS, Shin AY, Fortescue EB, etal |title=Hyponatremia among runners in the Boston Marathon |journal=The New England Journal of Medicine |volume=352 |issue=15 |pages=1550\u20136 |date=April 2005  |pmid=15829535 |doi=10.1056/NEJMoa043901|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/1dd20ec1e1d0562b0a679e5216cc30823121a399 }}</ref> A study conducted on participants of the 2002 Boston Marathon found that thirteen percent finished the race with hyponatremia. The study concluded that the strongest predictor of hyponatremia was weight gain while racing (over-hydration), and hyponatremia was just as likely to occur in runners who chose sports drinks as those who chose water.<ref name = \"NEJMed1\"/> Medical personnel at marathon events are trained to suspect water intoxication immediately when runners collapse or show signs of confusion.\n\n===Overexertion and heat stress===\nAny activity or situation that promotes heavy sweating can lead to water intoxication when water is consumed to replace lost fluids. Persons working in extreme heat and/or humidity for long periods must take care to drink and eat in ways that help to maintain electrolyte balance.  People using drugs such as [[MDMA]] (often referred to colloquially as \"Ecstasy\") may overexert themselves, perspire heavily, feel increased thirst, and then drink large amounts of water to rehydrate, leading to electrolyte imbalance and water intoxication \u2013 this is compounded by MDMA use increasing the levels of antidiuretic hormone (ADH), decreasing the amount of water lost through urination.<ref>{{cite book |first=John |last=Timbrell |title=The Poison Paradox: Chemicals as Friends and Foes |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qYYOtQU37jcC |year=2005 |publisher=OUP Oxford |isbn=978-0-19-280495-2}}</ref>  Even people who are resting quietly in extreme heat or humidity may run the risk of water intoxication if they drink large amounts of water over short periods for rehydration.\n\n===Psychiatric conditions===\n[[Psychogenic polydipsia]] is the psychiatric condition in which patients feel compelled to drink large quantities of water, thus putting them at risk of water intoxication. This condition can be especially dangerous if the patient also exhibits other psychiatric indications (as is often the case), as the care-takers might misinterpret the hyponatremic symptoms.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Zerbe|first=Robert L.|last2=Robertson|first2=Gary L.|date=1981-12-24|title=A Comparison of Plasma Vasopressin Measurements with a Standard Indirect Test in the Differential Diagnosis of Polyuria|journal=New England Journal of Medicine|volume=305|issue=26|pages=1539\u20131546|doi=10.1056/NEJM198112243052601|issn=0028-4793|pmid=7311993}}</ref>\n\n===Iatrogenic===\nWhen an unconscious person is being fed intravenously (for example, [[total parenteral nutrition]]) or via a [[nasogastric tube]], the fluids given must be carefully balanced in composition to match fluids and electrolytes lost.

This causes the cells to swell. In the brain, this swelling increases [[intracranial pressure]] (ICP), which leads to the first observable symptoms of water intoxication: headache, personality changes, changes in behavior, confusion, irritability, and drowsiness. These are sometimes followed by difficulty breathing during exertion, muscle weakness & pain, twitching, or cramping, nausea, vomiting, thirst, and a dulled ability to perceive and interpret sensory information. As the condition persists, papillary and vital signs may result including [[bradycardia]] and widened [[pulse pressure]]. The cells in the brain may swell to the point where blood flow is interrupted resulting in [[cerebral edema]]. Swollen brain cells may also apply [[Brain herniation|pressure to the brain stem]] causing central nervous system dysfunction. Both cerebral edema and interference with the central nervous system are dangerous and could result in seizures, brain damage, coma or death.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Moreau|first1=David|title=Fluids & Electrolytes Made Incredibly Easy!|date=2008|publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins|location=Philadelphia|isbn=978-1582555652|pages=75\u201377|edition=4th}}</ref>\n\n==Prevention==\nWater intoxication can be prevented if a person's intake of water does not grossly exceed their losses.  Healthy kidneys are able to excrete approximately 800 millilitres to 1 litre of fluid water (0.84 - 1.04 quarts) per hour.<ref name=sa/> However, stress (from prolonged physical exertion), as well as disease states, can greatly reduce this amount.<ref name=sa>{{cite web|url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=strange-but-true-drinking-too-much-water-can-kill|title=Strange but True: Drinking Too Much Water Can Kill|author=Coco Ballantyne|publisher=|accessdate=31 August 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Treatment==\nMild intoxication may remain asymptomatic and require only fluid restriction.

{"title_page": "Admeto", "text_new": "{{Handel operas}}\n'''''{{Lang|it|Admeto, re di Tessaglia}}''''' (\"Admetus, King of Thessaly\", [[HWV]] 22) is a three-act [[opera]] written for the [[Royal Academy of Music (1719)|Royal Academy of Music]] with music composed by [[George Frideric Handel]] to an Italian-language libretto prepared by [[Nicola Haym]]. The story is partly based on [[Euripides]]' ''[[Alcestis (play)|Alcestis]]''. The opera's first performance was at the [[Haymarket Theatre]] in London on 31 January 1727. The original cast included [[Faustina Bordoni]] as Alcestis and [[Francesca Cuzzoni]] as Antigona, as ''Admeto'' was the second of the five operas that Handel composed to feature specifically these two ''{{Lang|it|[[Prima donna|prime donne]]}}'' of the day.<ref>Dean, Winton, \"Reports: Birmingham\" (July 1968). ''[[The Musical Times]]'', '''109''' (1505): pp. 651\u2013656.</ref>\n\nThe opera was very successful at its first performances. However the presence of two prima donnas in the London operas had created factions of very partisan supporters of either one or the other ladies, and some performances were disrupted by hisses and loud cat calls by supporters of one of the star sopranos whenever the other one was singing, creating public scandal.\n\n==Background==\n[[File:London Kings Theatre Haymarket.jpg|thumb|The King's Theatre, London, where ''Admeto'' had its first performance.]]\nThe German-born Handel, after spending some of his early career composing operas and other pieces in Italy, settled in London, where in 1711 he had brought Italian opera for the first time with his opera ''[[Rinaldo (opera)|Rinaldo]]''. A tremendous success, ''Rinaldo'' created a craze in London for Italian opera seria, a form focused overwhelmingly on solo arias for the star virtuoso singers. In 1719, Handel was appointed [[Kapellmeister|music director]] of an organisation called the Royal Academy of Music (unconnected with the present day London conservatoire), a company under royal charter to produce Italian operas in London. Handel was not only to compose operas for the company but hire the star singers, supervise the orchestra and musicians, and adapt operas from Italy for London performance.<ref>Dean, W. & J.M. Knapp (1995) Handel's operas 1704-1726, p. 298.</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1qw8AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA273 |title=Essays on Handel and Italian opera by Reinhard Strohm |publisher=Books.google.nl |date= |accessdate=2013-02-02}}</ref>\n\nHandel had composed numerous Italian operas for the Academy, with varying degrees of success; some were enormously popular. The star soprano Francesca Cuzzoni had partnered with internationally renowned castrato Senesino as the leading performers in a long series of Italian operas by Handel and other composers for the Academy, and to increase audience interest, the directors decided to import another celebrated singer from Italy, soprano Faustina Bordoni, so that the operas would have not one but two leading ladies onstage. This was a common practice in opera houses of the day in Italy and Cuzzoni and Faustina, as Bordoni was called, had appeared together in various European cities without incident.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Burrows|first1=Donald|title=Handel (Master Musicians)|date=2012|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0199737369}}</ref>\n\n==Roles==\n[[Image:Senesino portrait edited.jpg|thumb|250px|Senesino, who created the role of Admeto]]\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Role\n![[Voice type]]\n!Premiere cast<ref>\n{{Almanacco|dmy=31-01-1727|match=Admeto}}</ref><br />31 January 1727\n|-\n|Alceste ([[Alcestis]]) || [[soprano]] || [[Faustina Bordoni]]\n|-\n|Antigona ||soprano || [[Francesca Cuzzoni]]\n|-\n|Admeto ([[Admetus]]) || [[alto]] [[castrato]] || Francesco Bernardi (\"[[Senesino]]\")\n|-\n|Ercole ([[Heracles]]) || [[bass (voice type)|bass]] || [[Giuseppe Maria Boschi]]\n|-\n|Trasimede (Thrasymedes) || alto castrato|| Antonio Baldi\n|-\n|Orindo || [[contralto]] || [[Anna Vincenza Dotti]]\n|-\n|Meraspe || bass || [[Giovanni Battista Palmerini]]\n|-\n|[[Apollo]] || bass ||\n|-\n|A voice || [[baritone]] ||\n|}\n\n==Synopsis==\n\n===Act 1===\n[[File:The Death of Alceste by Pierre Peyron (1785).jpg|thumb|The Death of Alceste by Pierre Peyron (1785).]]\n:Scene:Greece, in legendary times.\n\nIn a room of his palace, dominated by a statue of the god Apollo, King Admetus of Thessaly lies dying, tormented by terrible dreams. He is told by a courtier, Orindo, that his brother, Trasimede, is also in a bad way, obsessed with the portrait of a woman. The hero Hercules, on his never ending mission to perform glorious deeds to increase his fame, has come to pay a visit to his friend King Admetus. As her husband the king sleeps, his wife Alceste prays to Apollo to spare his life. The statue speaks and informs her that only if a close relative dies in his place will Admetus be permitted to continue to live. Alceste resolves to sacrifice her life for her husband.\n\nLiving in a nearby wood, disguised as shepherds, are Princess Antigona of Troy (which was burnt to the ground by Hercules) and her tutor Merapse. King Admetus had been betrothed to marry Antigona, but jilted her in favour of Alceste. This rejection of her is the reason, Antigona believes, why he is being punished with a mortal illness. She sends Merapse to the palace, instructing him to pretend that he is her father.\n\nIn the gardens of the palace, Alceste holds a dagger, preparing to die in her husband's place as she bids farewell to her grieving ladies-in-waiting, and then retires. Admetus, rejuvenated, enters with his friend Hercules, celebrating his recovery. Lamentations are heard from within and Admetus is horrified to see his wife's dead body. Admetus knows that Hercules once descended into the underworld and brought the hero Theseus back to the land of the living and asks him to do the same for Alceste, to which Hercules agrees.\n\nMerapse returns to Antigona in the woods and tells her about Alceste's death and Admetus' recovery. They are glad that now there seems to be nothing in the way of Admetus making Antigona his wife, as he had promised. A hunting party approaches, led by Trasimede, who recognises Antigona as the woman whose portrait he carries about with him at all times, never ceasing to gaze at it. She insists, however, that he is mistaken; her name is Rosilda, she tells him, and the man with her is her father, called Fidalbo. Trasimede offers her a job at the palace, working as a gardener, which Antigona is glad to accept as she will be able to be close to Admetus that way and hopes to teach him a lesson.\n\n===Act 2===\n[[File:Heinrich Aldegrever - Hercules und Cerebus (1550, San Francisco).jpg|left|thumb|upright|Hercules and Cerberus.]]\nThe second act opens in Hades, where Alceste, tormented by the Furies, is chained to a rock. Hercules appears, fights with [[Cerberus]] the guard dog of hell, overcomes the Furies and breaks the fetters tying Alceste to the rock. She joyfully looks forward to being reunited with her husband.\n\nAntigona is working at her new job as a gardener at the palace, where she has attracted the unwelcome attentions of the courtier Orindo, whom she spurns. Trasimede has lost interest in the portrait he was so obsessed with now he sees \"Rosilda\" who so closely resembles it, and tosses the portrait aside, whereupon Orindo picks it up. Antigona / \"Rosilda\" is not interested in anyone but King Admetus, however, and rejects Trasimede also.\n\nOrindo takes the portrait to Admetus and tells him that Trasimede had not been honest when he had shown him another portrait of the Trojan princess he had been engaged to; Trasimede had obviously substituted a portrait of a far less attractive girl. Admetus is astonished by the resemblance of the portrait to his new gardener \"Rosilda\"; she tells him that Princess Antigona is dead and asks him if she were still alive, would he marry her. Admetus gives no satisfactory answer, leaving \"Rosilda\" still very unhappy.\n\nIn the woods, Alceste, returned to life, is now disguised as a male soldier, worried that her husband, thinking her dead, may have fallen in love with someone else or even married another woman. When she sees the lovely \"Rosilda\" working in the palace gardens, she worries her fears were well-founded.\n\n===Act 3===\nTrasimede, madly in love with \"Rosilda\", has abducted her. Merapse tells Admetus who \"Rosilda\" really is and that she still loves the king. Hercules, not wanting to give Alceste's disguise away, tells Admetus that he was unable to find her in Hades. It seems to Admetus that his duty is now to marry Antigona.\n\nTrasimede, feeling guilty about abducting \"Rosilda\", has released her. When the disguised Alceste sees \"Rosilda\" sighing over a portrait of King Admetus, she snatches it from her hand. \nAdmetus and Antigona make plans for their wedding, watched by the jealous Trasimede and Alceste in disguise. Trasimede decides to kill his brother but Alceste dashes his weapon from his hand, saving her husband's life. When Admetus realises Alceste has been restored to life, he is undecided as to the honourable course for him to take - should he return to his wife, whom he thought dead, or keep his pledge to Antigona? Antigona solves this dilemma for him by taking his hand and putting it in that of Alceste, telling the king to return to the woman who has now saved his life twice. Trasimede begs his brother for forgiveness, which is granted. Alceste rejoices once more in her husband's love.<ref name=\"House\">{{cite web|title=Admeto|url=https://handelhendrix.org/learn/about-handel/opera-synopses/admeto/|website=handelhendrix.org|accessdate=29 December 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Synopsis of Admeto|url=http://www.naxos.com/mainsite/NewDesign/fintro.files/bintro.files/operas/Admeto(Admetus).htm|publisher=Naxos Records|accessdate=4 June 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Musical features==\nThe opening of the opera, with Admeto on his deathbed tormented by a ballet of demons representing his inner physical and mental agony, is very striking in its use of unusual harmonies, dissonance and chromaticism, followed by a dramatic [[Recitative|accompanied recitative]] for the suffering king.<ref>{{cite book|last1=McClelland|first1=Clive|title=Ombra: Supernatural Music in the Eighteenth Century|date=2012|publisher=Lexington Books|isbn=978-0739169735|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/ombrasupernatura0000mccl}}</ref>  18th century musicologist [[Charles Burney]] wrote that he was \"told by persons who heard this opera performed when it first came out, that Senesino never sung or acted better, or more to the satisfaction of the public, than in this scene.\"<ref>Charles Burney: ''A General History of Music: from the Earliest Ages to the Present Period.''

One of Handel's most loyal supporters, [[Mary Delany]], wrote to her sister that she had attended ''Admeto'' with a friend who \"was driven out of her senses\" by the singing of Faustina, Cuzzoni and Senesino.<ref name=House /> At the conclusion of one of Cuzzoni's arias at a performance of the original run, a man in the gallery called out \"Damn her: she has got a nest of nightingales in her belly\", while one aristocratic patron wrote in her programme beside Cuzzoni's name \"She is a devil of a singer\".<ref name=House />\n\nHowever, some members of the London audience had become fiercely partisan in favouring either Bordoni or Cuzzoni and disliking the other and at the performance of ''Admeto'' on 4 April 1727 with members of the royal family present, elements of the audience were extremely unruly, hissing and interrupting the performance with cat-calls when the \"rival\" to their favourite was performing, causing public scandal. Cuzzoni issued a public apology to the royal family through one of her supporters:\n\n{{quote|..Cuzzoni had been publicly told...she was to be hissed off the stage on Tuesday;  she was in such concern at this, that she had a great mind not to sing, but I...positively ordered her not to quit the stage, but let them do what they would...and she owns now that if she had not had that order she would have quitted the stage when they cat-called her to such a degree in one song, that she was not heard one note, which provoked the people that liked her so much, that they were not able to get the better of their resentment, but would not suffer the Faustina to speak afterwards.<ref name=House />}}\n[[File:Portrait of soprano Susannah Maria Cibber.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Francesca Cuzzoni, who created the role of Antigona.]]\nThese sort of disturbances continued however, climaxing that June in a performance at the Academy of an opera by [[Giovanni Bononcini]], ''Astianatte''. With royalty again present in the person of the Princess of Wales, Cuzzoni and Faustina were onstage together and members of the audience who were supporters of one of the prima donnas were loudly protesting and hissing whenever the other one sang. Actual fist fights broke out in the audience between rival groups of \"fans\" and Cuzzoni and Faustina stopped singing, began trading insults and finally came to blows onstage and had to be dragged apart.<ref name=Hyperion>{{cite web|last1=Hicks|first1=Anthony|title=Programme Notes for \"The Rival Queens\"|url=http://www.hyperion-records.co.uk/al.asp?al=CDA66950|publisher=Hyperion Records|accessdate=3 June 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Snowman|first1=Daniel|title=The Gilded Stage: A Social History of Opera|date=2010|publisher=Atlantic Books|isbn=978-1843544661}}</ref><ref name=Dean>{{cite book|last1=Dean|first1=Winton|title=The New Grove Handel|date=1997|publisher=W.

The story is partly based on [[Euripides]]' ''[[Alcestis (play)|Alcestis]]''. The opera's first performance was at the [[Haymarket Theatre]] in London on 31 January 1727. The original cast included [[Faustina Bordoni]] as Alcestis and [[Francesca Cuzzoni]] as Antigona, as ''Admeto'' was the second of the five operas that Handel composed to feature specifically these two ''{{Lang|it|[[Prima donna|prime donne]]}}'' of the day.<ref>Dean, Winton, \"Reports: Birmingham\" (July 1968).

However the presence of two prima donnas in the London operas had created factions of very partisan supporters of either one or the other ladies, and some performances were disrupted by hisses and loud cat calls by supporters of one of the star sopranos whenever the other one was singing, creating public scandal.\n\n==Background==\n[[File:London Kings Theatre Haymarket.jpg|thumb|The King's Theatre, London, where ''Admeto'' had its first performance.]]\nThe German-born Handel, after spending some of his early career composing operas and other pieces in Italy, settled in London, where in 1711 he had brought Italian opera for the first time with his opera ''[[Rinaldo (opera)|Rinaldo]]''. A tremendous success, ''Rinaldo'' created a craze in London for Italian opera seria, a form focused overwhelmingly on solo arias for the star virtuoso singers. In 1719, Handel was appointed [[Kapellmeister|music director]] of an organisation called the Royal Academy of Music (unconnected with the present day London conservatoire), a company under royal charter to produce Italian operas in London. Handel was not only to compose operas for the company but hire the star singers, supervise the orchestra and musicians, and adapt operas from Italy for London performance.<ref>Dean, W. & J.M.

The star soprano Francesca Cuzzoni had partnered with internationally renowned castrato Senesino as the leading performers in a long series of Italian operas by Handel and other composers for the Academy, and to increase audience interest, the directors decided to import another celebrated singer from Italy, soprano Faustina Bordoni, so that the operas would have not one but two leading ladies onstage. This was a common practice in opera houses of the day in Italy and Cuzzoni and Faustina, as Bordoni was called, had appeared together in various European cities without incident.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Burrows|first1=Donald|title=Handel (Master Musicians)|date=2012|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0199737369}}</ref>\n\n==Roles==\n[[Image:Senesino portrait edited.jpg|thumb|250px|Senesino, who created the role of Admeto]]\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Role\n![[Voice type]]\n!Premiere cast<ref>\n{{Almanacco|dmy=31-01-1727|match=Admeto}}</ref><br />31 January 1727\n|-\n|Alceste ([[Alcestis]]) || [[soprano]] || [[Faustina Bordoni]]\n|-\n|Antigona ||soprano || [[Francesca Cuzzoni]]\n|-\n|Admeto ([[Admetus]]) || [[alto]] [[castrato]] || Francesco Bernardi (\"[[Senesino]]\")\n|-\n|Ercole ([[Heracles]]) || [[bass (voice type)|bass]] || [[Giuseppe Maria Boschi]]\n|-\n|Trasimede (Thrasymedes) || alto castrato|| Antonio Baldi\n|-\n|Orindo || [[contralto]] || [[Anna Vincenza Dotti]]\n|-\n|Meraspe || bass || [[Giovanni Battista Palmerini]]\n|-\n|[[Apollo]] || bass ||\n|-\n|A voice || [[baritone]] ||\n|}\n\n==Synopsis==\n\n===Act 1===\n[[File:The Death of Alceste by Pierre Peyron (1785).jpg|thumb|The Death of Alceste by Pierre Peyron (1785).]]\n:Scene:Greece, in legendary times.\n\nIn a room of his palace, dominated by a statue of the god Apollo, King Admetus of Thessaly lies dying, tormented by terrible dreams. He is told by a courtier, Orindo, that his brother, Trasimede, is also in a bad way, obsessed with the portrait of a woman. The hero Hercules, on his never ending mission to perform glorious deeds to increase his fame, has come to pay a visit to his friend King Admetus. As her husband the king sleeps, his wife Alceste prays to Apollo to spare his life. The statue speaks and informs her that only if a close relative dies in his place will Admetus be permitted to continue to live. Alceste resolves to sacrifice her life for her husband.\n\nLiving in a nearby wood, disguised as shepherds, are Princess Antigona of Troy (which was burnt to the ground by Hercules) and her tutor Merapse. King Admetus had been betrothed to marry Antigona, but jilted her in favour of Alceste. This rejection of her is the reason, Antigona believes, why he is being punished with a mortal illness. She sends Merapse to the palace, instructing him to pretend that he is her father.\n\nIn the gardens of the palace, Alceste holds a dagger, preparing to die in her husband's place as she bids farewell to her grieving ladies-in-waiting, and then retires. Admetus, rejuvenated, enters with his friend Hercules, celebrating his recovery. Lamentations are heard from within and Admetus is horrified to see his wife's dead body. Admetus knows that Hercules once descended into the underworld and brought the hero Theseus back to the land of the living and asks him to do the same for Alceste, to which Hercules agrees.\n\nMerapse returns to Antigona in the woods and tells her about Alceste's death and Admetus' recovery. They are glad that now there seems to be nothing in the way of Admetus making Antigona his wife, as he had promised. A hunting party approaches, led by Trasimede, who recognises Antigona as the woman whose portrait he carries about with him at all times, never ceasing to gaze at it. She insists, however, that he is mistaken; her name is Rosilda, she tells him, and the man with her is her father, called Fidalbo. Trasimede offers her a job at the palace, working as a gardener, which Antigona is glad to accept as she will be able to be close to Admetus that way and hopes to teach him a lesson.\n\n===Act 2===\n[[File:Heinrich Aldegrever - Hercules und Cerebus (1550, San Francisco).jpg|left|thumb|upright|Hercules and Cerberus.]]\nThe second act opens in Hades, where Alceste, tormented by the Furies, is chained to a rock. Hercules appears, fights with [[Cerberus]] the guard dog of hell, overcomes the Furies and breaks the fetters tying Alceste to the rock. She joyfully looks forward to being reunited with her husband.\n\nAntigona is working at her new job as a gardener at the palace, where she has attracted the unwelcome attentions of the courtier Orindo, whom she spurns. Trasimede has lost interest in the portrait he was so obsessed with now he sees \"Rosilda\" who so closely resembles it, and tosses the portrait aside, whereupon Orindo picks it up. Antigona / \"Rosilda\" is not interested in anyone but King Admetus, however, and rejects Trasimede also.\n\nOrindo takes the portrait to Admetus and tells him that Trasimede had not been honest when he had shown him another portrait of the Trojan princess he had been engaged to; Trasimede had obviously substituted a portrait of a far less attractive girl. Admetus is astonished by the resemblance of the portrait to his new gardener \"Rosilda\"; she tells him that Princess Antigona is dead and asks him if she were still alive, would he marry her. Admetus gives no satisfactory answer, leaving \"Rosilda\" still very unhappy.\n\nIn the woods, Alceste, returned to life, is now disguised as a male soldier, worried that her husband, thinking her dead, may have fallen in love with someone else or even married another woman. When she sees the lovely \"Rosilda\" working in the palace gardens, she worries her fears were well-founded.\n\n===Act 3===\nTrasimede, madly in love with \"Rosilda\", has abducted her. Merapse tells Admetus who \"Rosilda\" really is and that she still loves the king. Hercules, not wanting to give Alceste's disguise away, tells Admetus that he was unable to find her in Hades. It seems to Admetus that his duty is now to marry Antigona.\n\nTrasimede, feeling guilty about abducting \"Rosilda\", has released her. When the disguised Alceste sees \"Rosilda\" sighing over a portrait of King Admetus, she snatches it from her hand. \nAdmetus and Antigona make plans for their wedding, watched by the jealous Trasimede and Alceste in disguise. Trasimede decides to kill his brother but Alceste dashes his weapon from his hand, saving her husband's life. When Admetus realises Alceste has been restored to life, he is undecided as to the honourable course for him to take - should he return to his wife, whom he thought dead, or keep his pledge to Antigona? Antigona solves this dilemma for him by taking his hand and putting it in that of Alceste, telling the king to return to the woman who has now saved his life twice. Trasimede begs his brother for forgiveness, which is granted. Alceste rejoices once more in her husband's love.<ref name=\"House\">{{cite web|title=Admeto|url=https://handelhendrix.org/learn/about-handel/opera-synopses/admeto/|website=handelhendrix.org|accessdate=29 December 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Synopsis of Admeto|url=http://www.naxos.com/mainsite/NewDesign/fintro.files/bintro.files/operas/Admeto(Admetus).htm|publisher=Naxos Records|accessdate=4 June 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Musical features==\nThe opening of the opera, with Admeto on his deathbed tormented by a ballet of demons representing his inner physical and mental agony, is very striking in its use of unusual harmonies, dissonance and chromaticism, followed by a dramatic [[Recitative|accompanied recitative]] for the suffering king.<ref>{{cite book|last1=McClelland|first1=Clive|title=Ombra: Supernatural Music in the Eighteenth Century|date=2012|publisher=Lexington Books|isbn=978-0739169735|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/ombrasupernatura0000mccl}}</ref>  18th century musicologist [[Charles Burney]] wrote that he was \"told by persons who heard this opera performed when it first came out, that Senesino never sung or acted better, or more to the satisfaction of the public, than in this scene.\"<ref>Charles Burney: ''A General History of Music: from the Earliest Ages to the Present Period.''

Cuzzoni issued a public apology to the royal family through one of her supporters:\n\n{{quote|..Cuzzoni had been publicly told...she was to be hissed off the stage on Tuesday;  she was in such concern at this, that she had a great mind not to sing, but I...positively ordered her not to quit the stage, but let them do what they would...and she owns now that if she had not had that order she would have quitted the stage when they cat-called her to such a degree in one song, that she was not heard one note, which provoked the people that liked her so much, that they were not able to get the better of their resentment, but would not suffer the Faustina to speak afterwards.<ref name=House />}}\n[[File:Portrait of soprano Susannah Maria Cibber.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Francesca Cuzzoni, who created the role of Antigona.]]\nThese sort of disturbances continued however, climaxing that June in a performance at the Academy of an opera by [[Giovanni Bononcini]],''Astianatte''. With royalty again present in the person of the Princess of Wales, Cuzzoni and Faustina were onstage together and members of the audience who were supporters of one of the prima donnas were loudly protesting and hissing whenever the other one sang.
