The full facts of the case remain unclear, but our current information indicates that Mr Lee was involuntarily removed to the mainland without any due process under Hong Kong SAR law. This constitutes a serious breach of the Sino-British Joint Declaration on Hong Kong and undermines the principle of \u201cOne Country, Two Systems\u201d which assures Hong Kong residents of the protection of the Hong Kong legal system. We have called, in our contacts with the Chinese government at the highest level, for Mr Lee's immediate return to Hong Kong. We urge the Chinese and Hong Kong SAR governments to reassure the people of Hong Kong that law enforcement in the Hong Kong SAR is exclusively the responsibility of the Hong Kong SAR authorities, and that the fundamental rights and freedoms of Hong Kong residents will continue to be fully protected, and respected by all, in accordance with the Joint Declaration and Basic Law.\"<ref>https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/499940/The_Six_Monthly_Report_on_Hong_Kong_-_1_July_to_31_December_2015.pdf</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thestandnews.com/politics/%E8%8B%B1%E5%A4%96%E7%9B%B8%E7%99%BC%E8%A1%A8%E5%A0%B1%E5%91%8A-%E6%9D%8E%E6%B3%A2%E8%A2%AB%E9%9D%9E%E8%87%AA%E9%A1%98%E9%81%A3%E9%80%81%E4%B8%AD%E5%9C%8B-%E9%81%95%E5%8F%8D%E4%B8%AD%E8%8B%B1%E8%81%AF%E5%90%88%E8%81%B2%E6%98%8E/|title=\u82f1\u5916\u76f8\u767c\u8868\u5831\u544a\uff1a\u674e\u6ce2\u88ab\u975e\u81ea\u9858\u9063\u9001\u4e2d\u570b\u3000\u806f\u7d61\u5317\u4eac\u6700\u9ad8\u5c64\u4fc3\u653e\u4eba &#124; \u7acb\u5834\u5831\u9053 &#124; \u7acb\u5834\u65b0\u805e}}</ref>\n\n=== Destruction of first bookstore\u2019s stocks ===\nUp until the disappearances, the first bookstore maintained a stock of books for sale \u2013 in excess of 100,000 units \u2013 in two warehouses.

We have called, in our contacts with the Chinese government at the highest level, for Mr Lee's immediate return to Hong Kong. We urge the Chinese and Hong Kong SAR governments to reassure the people of Hong Kong that law enforcement in the Hong Kong SAR is exclusively the responsibility of the Hong Kong SAR authorities, and that the fundamental rights and freedoms of Hong Kong residents will continue to be fully protected, and respected by all, in accordance with the Joint Declaration and Basic Law.\"<ref>https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/499940/The_Six_Monthly_Report_on_Hong_Kong_-_1_July_to_31_December_2015.pdf</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thestandnews.com/politics/%E8%8B%B1%E5%A4%96%E7%9B%B8%E7%99%BC%E8%A1%A8%E5%A0%B1%E5%91%8A-%E6%9D%8E%E6%B3%A2%E8%A2%AB%E9%9D%9E%E8%87%AA%E9%A1%98%E9%81%A3%E9%80%81%E4%B8%AD%E5%9C%8B-%E9%81%95%E5%8F%8D%E4%B8%AD%E8%8B%B1%E8%81%AF%E5%90%88%E8%81%B2%E6%98%8E/|title=\u82f1\u5916\u76f8\u767c\u8868\u5831\u544a\uff1a\u674e\u6ce2\u88ab\u975e\u81ea\u9858\u9063\u9001\u4e2d\u570b\u3000\u806f\u7d61\u5317\u4eac\u6700\u9ad8\u5c64\u4fc3\u653e\u4eba &#124; \u7acb\u5834\u5831\u9053 &#124; \u7acb\u5834\u65b0\u805e}}</ref>\n\n=== Destruction of first bookstore\u2019s stocks ===\nUp until the disappearances, the first bookstore maintained a stock of books for sale \u2013 in excess of 100,000 units \u2013 in two warehouses.

Also neighbouring Gulberg were [[New Karachi Town|New Karachi]] and [[Gadap Town|Gadap]] to the north and [[Liaquatabad Town|Liaquatabad]] to the south.\n\n== History ==\nThe federal government under [[Pervez Musharraf]], who seized power in a [[1999 Pakistani coup d'\u00e9tat|1999 coup d'etat]], introduced local government reforms in the year 2000, which eliminated the previous \"third tier of government\" ([[Divisions of Pakistan|administrative divisions]]) and replaced it with the fourth tier ([[Districts of Pakistan|districts]]). The effect in Karachi was the dissolution of the former [[Karachi Division]] in 2001, and the merging of its five districts to form a new Karachi City-District with eighteen autonomous constituent towns including Gulberg Town. In 2011, the system was disbanded but remained in place for bureaucratic administration until 2015, when the [[Karachi Metropolitan Corporation]] system was reintroduced. In 2015, Gulberg Town was re-organized as part of [[District of Central Karachi|Karachi Central]] district.\n\n== Education and academia ==\nApart from the socio-economic diversification, this town had the distinction of being one of the most literate middle/upper middle class parts of the city along with [[North Nazimabad Town]].

Also neighbouring Gulberg were [[New Karachi Town|New Karachi]] and [[Gadap Town|Gadap]] to the north and [[Liaquatabad Town|Liaquatabad]] to the south.\n\n== History ==\nThe federal government under [[Pervez Musharraf]], who seized power in a [[1999 Pakistani coup d'\u00e9tat|1999 coup d'etat]], introduced local government reforms in the year 2000, which eliminated the previous \"third tier of government\" ([[Divisions of Pakistan|administrative divisions]]) and replaced it with the fourth tier ([[Districts of Pakistan|districts]]). The effect in Karachi was the dissolution of the former [[Karachi Division]] in 2001, and the merging of its five districts to form a new Karachi City-District with eighteen autonomous constituent towns including Gulberg Town. In 2011, the system was disbanded but remained in place for bureaucratic administration until 2015, when the [[Karachi Metropolitan Corporation]] system was reintroduced. In 2015, Gulberg Town was re-organized as part of [[District of Central Karachi|Karachi Central]] district.\n\n== Education and academia ==\nApart from the socio-economic diversification, this town had the distinction of being one of the most literate middle/upper middle class parts of the city along with [[North Nazimabad Town]]. There were numerous coaching centres in Gulberg Town, among them C.A.M.P.

In 1976, an extension was opened along the former mineral line from Abergynolwyn to the new station at Nant Gwernol. In 2001, the preservation society celebrated its 50th anniversary, and in 2005 a major rebuilding and extension of [[Tywyn Wharf railway station|Tywyn Wharf station]] took place, including a much-expanded facility for the [[Narrow Gauge Railway Museum]].\n\nThe fictional [[Skarloey Railway]], which formed part of ''[[The Railway Series]]'' of children's books by [[W. V. Awdry|The Rev. W. Awdry]], was based on the Talyllyn Railway. The preservation of the line inspired the [[Ealing Comedy]] film ''[[The Titfield Thunderbolt]]''.\n\n==Name and gauge==\nThe origin of the railway's name is uncertain: it may refer to the parish of [[Tal-y-llyn, Gwynedd|Tal-y-llyn]], which contains its eastern terminus,<ref>Johnson 1999, page 27</ref> or it may come from [[Tal-y-llyn Lake|Tal-y-llyn]],{{refn|group=lower-alpha|name=hyphen|According to the [[Ordnance Survey]], the name of the lake is hyphenated.

Underground working began in the early 1840s,<ref name=AJR195>Richards 1999, page 195</ref> and by 1847 the quarry was being worked by local landowner John Pughe. The finished slates were sent by [[packhorse]] to the wharf at [[Pennal]], transferred to boats for a river trip to [[Aberdyfi]] (or the Anglicised Aberdovey still commonly used), and then finally loaded into seagoing vessels, a complex and expensive transportation arrangement which limited the quarry's output.<ref>Boyd 1965, pages 62\u201363</ref> In 1861 the outbreak of the [[American Civil War]] cut off supplies of [[cotton]] to the [[Cotton mill|mills]] of the north west of England and as a result a number of prosperous mill owners looked for new business opportunities to diversify their interests. One such owner was [[William McConnel]] of [[Lancashire]] who, in 1859, had purchased [[Hengwrt|Hengwrt Hall]] near [[Dolgellau]], north of Tywyn. In January 1864, McConnel formed the Aberdovey Slate Company, which leased the land including Bryn Eglwys from the landowner, Lewis Morris of [[Machynlleth]].<ref>Boyd 1988, page 9</ref>\n\n[[File:Bryn Eglwys quarry - 2008-03-18.jpg|thumb|left|The remains of Bryn Eglwys quarry in 2008|alt=Large spoil heaps of slate appear on the hillside in a heavily wooded area. In the foreground is a small stone house, without a roof.]]\nMcConnel set about improving Bryn Eglwys to increase its output. He focused on providing rail transport for the isolated quarry, and in April 1864 he reached agreement with local landowners to purchase the land necessary to build a railway towards Tywyn and onwards to the port of Aberdyfi. Construction was well underway by July 1864.<ref>Drummond 2015, page s 9-11</ref> The standard gauge [[Aberystwyth and Welsh Coast Railway]] was expanding rapidly from its base at Machynlleth, however, and in 1863 had reached Tywyn, so McConnel decided to build his line from the quarry to Tywyn, as the nearest point where slate could be transferred to the standard gauge railway. This was despite the line's initial isolation from the rest of the system because of difficulties in bridging the estuary of the [[Afon Dyfi]] to the south.<ref>Boyd 1965, page 64</ref> An [[Acts of Parliament in the United Kingdom|Act of Parliament]] (28 and 29&nbsp;[[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Vict]], cap cccxv) allowing the company to operate passenger trains as a public railway was given [[Royal Assent]] on 5 July 1865,<ref>Boyd 1988, page 45</ref><ref>Potter, page 11</ref> and the company appointed [[The Spooners of Porthmadog|James Swinton Spooner]] as engineer for the construction. He laid out plans for a relatively straight line climbing steadily from Tywyn to the quarry and work quickly got underway. By September 1866 construction had advanced to the point where the [[Board of Trade]] inspector [[Henry Whatley Tyler|Captain Henry Tyler]] could make an initial inspection and report.<ref>Boyd 1965, page 65</ref>\n\nTyler's report led to an unusual alteration, as it was discovered that the internal width of the [[Overpass#Railway|overbridges]] was only {{convert|9|ft|1|in|cm|abbr=on}}, but the railway's [[List of Talyllyn Railway rolling stock#Carriages|passenger carriages]] were {{convert|5|ft|3.5|in|cm|abbr=on}} wide, leaving only {{convert|1|ft|10+3/4|in|cm|abbr=on}}  clearance on either side, which was {{convert|7+3/4|in|cm|1|abbr=on}} less than the minimum required [[Engineering tolerance|clearance]] of {{convert|2|ft|6|in|cm|abbr=on}}. To alleviate this problem, McConnel proposed that the doors on one side of each carriage be permanently barred and the track slewed off-centre beneath the bridges to allow adequate clearance at least on the side with doors, which would allow passengers to get out of the carriages if the train stopped underneath a bridge. Tyler agreed to this arrangement, and to this day all carriages on the Talyllyn have doors on one side only, an unusual feature for a public railway which is shared (albeit for different reasons) with the neighbouring Corris Railway.<ref>Boyd 1965, pages 68\u201369</ref> Tyler also required that improvements be made to the railway's first two steam locomotives, as locomotive No.&nbsp;1 suffered from excessive \"vertical motion\" and No.&nbsp;2 was said to suffer from \"horizontal oscillation\". No.&nbsp;1 was returned to its manufacturer where a set of [[trailing wheel]]s was added to reduce the rear overhang, and the [[Suspension (vehicle)#Springs and dampers|springs]] on No.&nbsp;2 were adjusted and the [[crank pin]]s shortened to reduce its oscillation.<ref name=Boyd6570>Boyd 1965, page 70</ref>\n\nTyler did not approve the opening until his listed improvements were completed, although slate trains and unofficial passenger trains were running in 1865.<ref>Drummond 2015, page 17</ref> During November of that 1866, Tyler returned to Tywyn and re-inspected the railway following which, subject to some further minor improvements, he approved its formal opening for passenger service. The first public passenger timetable was issued in December 1866,<ref>Rolt 1998, page 13</ref> and the first purpose-built, steam-worked, narrow gauge public railway in Britain opened for service.<ref>Boyd 1965, pages 68\u201370</ref>\n\n===Prosperity under McConnel: 1866\u20131880s===\n[[File:TalyllynOnDolgochViaduct.jpg|thumb|right|''Talyllyn'' posed on Dolgoch Viaduct around 1867, the earliest known photograph of the Talyllyn|alt=A stone viaduct with three arches spans a steep sided ravine. A steam train stands on the viaduct, with an engine, a van and three coaches.]]\n\nThe railway opened with two locomotives, one carriage and several goods vehicles in use and was operated under a \"[[Signalling block systems|one engine in steam]]\" policy to ensure that two trains could not collide.<ref name=Boyd6571>Boyd 1965, page 71</ref> Initially the working locomotive was housed in a wooden shed at Ty Dwr on the mineral line above [[Abergynolwyn railway station|Abergynolwyn station]], while the main engineering works at {{stnlnk|Pendre}} were constructed.<ref>Boyd 1988, page 149</ref> The Pendre works opened on 17 February 1867 and from then on trains began working from Pendre instead of Abergynolwyn.<ref name=Boyd6570/>\n\nAt the time of the line's opening, stations were provided at Pendre and Abergynolwyn. In 1867, the halt at {{stnlnk|Rhydyronen}} opened, followed by {{stnlnk|Brynglas}} and {{stnlnk|Dolgoch}} in 1873. Some time shortly after the opening of the railway a branch to Abergynolwyn village was provided. A steep [[cable railway|incline]] dropped from the mineral line east of Abergynolwyn station to the village below, where a series of tram lines radiated. Coal, building materials and general goods were delivered down the incline and the contents of the village [[cesspit]]s were hauled back up for disposal along the lineside.<ref name=Boyd6571/>\n\nThe railway used [[steam locomotive]]s from the start, unlike its neighbour the horse-drawn Corris Railway. The original two locomotives, although of entirely different design, were both purchased from [[Fletcher, Jennings & Co.]] of [[Whitehaven]] in [[Cumbria]],<ref>Rolt 1965, pages 82\u201383</ref> and both are still in service, 150&nbsp;years on, although so many of their parts have been replaced down the years that much of their present-day component metal is not original. The Talyllyn's rare gauge is thought to have been adopted to match that of the Corris Railway,<ref>Rolt 1998, pages 5\u20136</ref> and the line's two original steam locomotives were among the earliest locomotives built for such a narrow gauge. No.&nbsp;1 ''[[Talyllyn (locomotive)|Talyllyn]]'' is an {{whyte|0-4-2|ST}} and No.&nbsp;2 ''[[Dolgoch (locomotive)|Dolgoch]]'' is an {{whyte|0-4-0|WT}}. The line carried slate from the quarry to the wharf at Tywyn and general goods along its length. Public passenger trains initially ran between Abergynolwyn, Dolgoch and Pendre stations only; quarrymen were carried on unofficial trains that continued on from Abergynolwyn to the foot of the Alltwyllt incline in Nant Gwernol gorge.<ref name=Boyd6571/>\n\nThe line operated successfully during its early years, serving the quarry and the local district.

This used [[charabanc]]s to link the Talyllyn and Corris railways via Tal-y-llyn Lake and Cadair Idris, returning on [[Cambrian Railways]] trains.<ref>Rolt 1998, pages 24\u201325</ref> The last two decades of the 19th century saw a decline in the demand for slate and many smaller quarries fell on hard times, including Bryn Eglwys, where by 1890 production had halved to {{convert|4000|long ton}} a year.<ref name=AJR195/> In 1896, production at the [[Penrhyn Quarry]] in north Wales, one of the largest producers of slate, was stopped due to labour disputes, resulting in a temporary increase in demand at other quarries. McConnel expanded production at Bryn Eglwys to take advantage of the sudden demand, but only with the aim of maximising profits during the remainder of his lease, which was to expire in 1910. He built new trial levels without proper provision for the removal of [[overburden]] and pushed the limits of safe working in the existing chambers. As McConnel's lease drew to its close, there was no prospect of a further lessee coming forward and work began on dismantling the quarry's equipment.<ref name=Boyd6572/>\n\n===Haydn Jones era: 1911\u20131950===\nThe Bryn Eglwys quarry was the primary employer in the Abergynolwyn district, so its closure caused significant distress. In 1910, local landowner [[Henry Haydn Jones]] was elected the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] [[Member of Parliament#United Kingdom|MP]] for [[Merionethshire|Merioneth]]. He understood the importance of Bryn Eglwys, and at the end of the year he purchased the quarry company for just over \u00a35000.<ref name=\"Quine Haydn Jones\">{{cite article |last=Quine |first=Dan |authorlink=Dan Quine |title=The Talyllyn Railway in the late Haydn Jones era |publisher=Heritage Railway |volume=200 |date=March 2015}}</ref> The quarry re-opened in January 1911,<ref name=Boyd6572>Boyd 1965, pages 72\u201373</ref> though Haydn Jones did not have [[capital (economics)|capital]] to invest in the quarry. The first workings reopened were on the [[Broad Vein]], which yielded relatively hard slate that was less popular and therefore difficult to sell. The lack of an available market for this output forced the quarry to switch to extracting softer slate from the [[Narrow Vein]] but, because Haydn Jones could not afford to open new workings into the Narrow Vein, he resorted to the dangerous practice of narrowing the columns that supported the roofs of the underground chambers. This practice had begun under McConnel's ownership and Haydn Jones continued it throughout his ownership of the quarry.<ref name=Boyd6572/> A brief construction boom after the [[First World War]] saw production return to around {{convert|4000|long ton}} per year.<ref name=AJR195/>\n\nThe 1920s also saw an upsurge in holiday traffic, as Britain recovered from the war and tourism gained in popularity. The Talyllyn saw summer passenger numbers grow significantly and regularly had to supplement its formal passenger stock with slate wagons fitted with planks as seats.<ref>Ransom 1996, page 130</ref> An unusual tourist service offered by the railway was to hire a slate wagon, which would be left at Abergynolwyn. At the end of the day the tourists would return to Tywyn in the wagon, powered by [[Gravity railway|gravity]]. This service was discontinued in the early 1930s.<ref>Boyd 1965, pages 116\u2013117</ref> The additional income from the tourist trade defrayed some of the costs of operating the railway, but never enough for it to make a profit during Haydn Jones' ownership.\n\nThe lease on Bryn Eglwys expired in 1942, but was extended on an annual basis. The October 1942 Bradshaw's Guide shows two return passenger trains operating only on Monday, Wednesday and Fridays, taking 45 minutes in each direction. No passenger service was provided on other days. Overnight on 26 December 1946, several weakened support columns in the quarry gave way, resulting in a significant collapse; the quarry was deemed unsafe and closed immediately. Haydn Jones had promised to continue operating the railway as long as he was alive and so, despite the closure of the quarry, the railway continued to run trains on a shoestring budget. In 1947 the British railway system was nationalised and the Talyllyn was one of the few operating railways not included. The reasons for this are unclear, but it is significant that all official mention of the railway had ceased several decades before and it is likely that the line was simply forgotten by officialdom.<ref>Boyd 1965, pages 73\u201374</ref> Between 1947 and 1949 the railway ran a passenger service two days a week. In 1949 Haydn Jones, who owned the [[Aberllefenni Slate Quarry]] purchased 10 tons of rail from the recently lifted Corris Railway.<ref name=Quine>{{cite article |title=Not to be: The sad end of the Corris Railway |publisher=Heritage Railway |volume=220 |last=Quine |first=Dan |authorlink=Dan Quine}}</ref> On 2 July 1950 Haydn Jones died and closure of the railway seemed inevitable, but the line continued to operate for the remainder of the summer season, ending on 6 October.<ref>Boyd 1965, page 74</ref>\n{{clear}}\n\n==Preservation==\n===Rescue: 1951\u20131960===\n[[File:Tal-Y-Llyn Dolgoch Abergwynolwn 1951.jpg|thumb|right|Locomotive No. 2 ''Dolgoch'' at Abergynolwyn in 1951, early in the preservation era|alt=A small steam locomotive stands beside a banked area.

Rolt|Tom Rolt]], visited the line in 1949, along with the locomotive engineer [[David Curwen]].<ref>Potter, page 59</ref> In the summer of 1950, Rolt wrote a letter to the ''[[Birmingham Post]]'' newspaper suggesting that a rescue of the Talyllyn be undertaken. He received sufficient positive response for a meeting of interested enthusiasts to be held on 11 October 1950 at the Imperial Hotel in Birmingham. Around 70&nbsp;people, including [[Patrick Whitehouse]], attended the meeting, with Rolt proposing the formation of a committee to look into the acquisition of the railway. With the support of the meeting, the committee \u2013 with Rolt as chairman and Whitehouse as Secretary \u2013 met for the first time on 23 October and immediately entered into negotiation with Haydn Jones' executors.<ref>Rolt 1965, pages 52\u201353</ref>\n\nThe transfer of ownership to the committee was legally complex, but both parties agreed that all shares in the railway company would be transferred from Haydn Jones' estate to a new company called Talyllyn Holdings Ltd., whose board consisted of two directors from the executors and two from the committee. The transfer took place on 8 February 1951, at which point the newly formed Talyllyn Railway Preservation Society effectively took control of the railway. The Society immediately began to publicise its efforts, hoping to raise funds and find further volunteers to help reopen the railway, and by May nearly 650&nbsp;members had joined the society.<ref>Rolt 1965, pages 54\u201355</ref> The railway re-opened under the control of the Society for the first time on the [[Whit Monday]] bank holiday, 14 May 1951,<ref name=Potter78>Potter, page 78</ref> with trains running between Wharf and Rhydyronen stations.

When the line was taken over in 1950 ''[[Dolgoch (locomotive)|Dolgoch]]'' was the only operating locomotive and it was apparent that it was in need of a major overhaul. To enable operations to continue two further steam locomotives, Nos.&nbsp;3 and 4, were purchased from the recently closed Corris Railway in 1951 and named ''[[Sir Haydn (locomotive)|Sir Haydn]]'' and ''[[Edward Thomas (locomotive)|Edward Thomas]]'' respectively. Because both railways were built to the unusual gauge of {{Track gauge|2ft3in}}  it was relatively easy to adapt the Corris locomotives to work on the Talyllyn. No.&nbsp;3 became the first new locomotive to travel on the railway for over 80&nbsp;years in 1951, but it frequently [[Derailment|derailed]], and on inspection it turned out that the Talyllyn track was laid approximately half an inch (13&nbsp;mm) wider than the official gauge, a deliberate policy by the old company to accommodate the long [[wheelbase]] of ''Talyllyn''. Both ''Talyllyn'' and ''Dolgoch'' had unusually wide wheel treads that allowed them to stay on the wide-of-gauge track. This problem was eventually cured by relaying the railway to its correct gauge and altering ''Talyllyn'''s trailing wheels to allow them to swivel horizontally, shortening the locomotive's fixed wheelbase.<ref>Boyd 1988, page 260</ref> No.&nbsp;4 was unserviceable when it arrived, but John Alcock,<ref>Rolt 1998, picture facing page 109</ref> the chairman of the [[Hunslet Engine Company]], was a member of the Preservation Society and had No.&nbsp;4 overhauled free of charge at his works.<ref>Johnson 1997, page 57</ref> No.&nbsp;4 then began service on the railway in 1952 and worked the majority of the trains that season.<ref>Rolt 1998, page 132</ref>\n\n[[File:Guinness loco at NGRM - 2008-03-18.jpg|thumb|right|The Guinness brewery locomotive, the first exhibit donated to the Narrow Gauge Railway Museum|alt=A small green tank steam locomotive of unusual design, number 13, stands in the museum.

This locomotive was built for the [[British military narrow gauge railways|depot railway]] serving [[RAF Calshot]] where it worked until 1945, and, after rebuilding from its original {{Track gauge|2ft|lk=on}}  gauge, it entered service in 1954.<ref>Boyd 1965, pages 99\u2013100</ref> Through the 1950s the volunteers and staff members of the TRPS rebuilt the line and rescued it from its state of decay, during a period characterised by a \"[[Boy's Own Paper|''Boy's Own'' comic]] spirit of adventure, involving enthusiasm, ingenuity and a fair degree of irresponsibility\".<ref>Goddin 2002, page 46</ref>\n\nOn 22 May 1957 the [[BBC]] produced a live [[Outside broadcasting|outside broadcast]] from the railway, during which [[Wynford Vaughan Thomas]] and [[Huw Weldon]] commentated on a trip from Dolgoch to Abergynolwyn. The publicity from this broadcast drew substantial numbers of visitors to the railway that summer, with more than 57,500&nbsp;passengers carried, and this increase in revenue in turn enabled the railway to continue to improve its infrastructure and provide tourists with a better experience.<ref>Rolt 1965, pages 61\u201362</ref> The following year locomotive No.&nbsp;1 ''Talyllyn'' returned to steam after an extensive overhaul.<ref>Mitchell and Eyres, 2005 page 25</ref>\n\nAn important development during this period was the establishment of the [[Narrow Gauge Railway Museum]] at Tywyn Wharf station. The first exhibit for what was to become the museum was a locomotive donated in 1952 by [[Diageo|Guinness]] from their recently closed [[St. James's Gate Brewery]] railway. In 1954 the Preservation Society agreed to start work on a formal museum and exhibits from around the United Kingdom were acquired to form the nucleus of the collection. In 1955 work started on converting the old [[gunpowder magazine|gunpowder store]] at Wharf station into a temporary museum building, and in 1956 the first exhibit arrived at Tywyn.<ref>Rolt 1965, pages 112\u2013114</ref>\n\n===Securing the infrastructure: 1960\u20131969===\n[[File:Tywyn Wharf layout 1964.svg|thumb|left|Tywyn Wharf station in 1964, after layout improvements|alt=The British Railways main line runs in south-easterly direction from Barmouth to Aberdyfi. Wharf station, comprising the Narrow Gauge Railway Museum and an office building, is on the north-east side, south of a road that crosses the main line. The Talyllyn Railway enters Wharf from Pendre to the east, passing underneath a road bridge, past a goods shed and fanning out into four sidings, the center two of which form a run-round loop. The most southerly of the sidings curves round to join a line that runs parallel to the main line.]]\n\nThe 1960s proved to be a decade of consolidation for the Talyllyn. Pendre works underwent several much-needed expansions, adding additional covered storage for carriages and more workshop room. Modern machine tools, along with proper lighting and a new power supply were added. Substantial improvements to Tywyn Wharf station were also made, along with continued relaying and upgrading of the track to Abergynolwyn.<ref>Bate 2001, chapter 5</ref> Passenger numbers continued to climb after the 1957 BBC broadcast; in 1960, 67,000&nbsp;passenger journeys were made, increasing to 78,500 in 1964.<ref>Rolt 1965, page 99</ref> In response to this growing popularity the railway undertook a programme of new rolling stock construction.\n\nBy the early 1960s Tywyn Wharf station was in need of major improvements. Before preservation, the station had contained only a fan of sidings, which meant that there was no way for the locomotive of an arriving train to run round the carriages. As a result, trains were pushed from behind as far as Pendre, where the locomotive could be moved past the carriages to the front of the train. A [[passing loop|loop]] was installed at Wharf for the first time in August 1952, to avoid having to propel trains to Pendre,<ref name=Boyd6577>Boyd 1965, page 77</ref> but in the winter of 1964/65 a major upgrade of the station was carried out. This improved the track layout and extended the original office building to provide covered accommodation for passengers and a shop.<ref>Mitchell and Eyres, 2005 page 19</ref>\n\nAs passenger numbers continued to grow during the late 1960s it became clear that further motive power was needed, especially as the rebuilt No.&nbsp;1 was not performing well. The Talyllyn's unusual track gauge and restricted loading gauge meant that it was unlikely that a locomotive could be found that could work on the line unaltered,<ref>Mitchell and Eyres, 2005 page 87</ref> so in 1969 a {{Track gauge|3ft|lk=on}}  gauge steam locomotive was purchased from the [[Bord na Mona]] (Irish Peat Board) with a view to rebuilding it for use on the Talyllyn. This locomotive was unofficially known as ''Irish Pete'', a nod to its original use.<ref>Bate 2001, page 155</ref>\n{{clear}}\n\n===Extension to Nant Gwernol: 1969\u20131980===\n[[File:Alltwyllt incline - 2008-03-18.jpg|thumb|right|The head of the Alltwyllt incline at the end of the Nant Gwernol extension in 2008]]\nThe preservation society had long held ambitions to extend the railway along the former mineral extension from Abergynolwyn to the foot of the Alltwyllt incline, and as early as 1959 work had begun to trace the owners of the land that the extension traversed. Planning began in the mid-1960s, but construction did not start until 1968 when the winding house for the Abergynolwyn village incline was demolished.<ref name=Thomas34>Thomas 2002, page 34</ref> To bring the line up to passenger standards some of the curves needed to be eased, and this required blasting work, as the line runs on a narrow ledge on the hillside at this point.<ref>Bate 2001, page 181</ref> The extension and new station at Nant Gwernol were opened on 22 May 1976 by Wynford Vaughan Thomas who drove in the ceremonial \"[[golden spike]]\" to complete the extension.<ref>Bate 2001, pages 184\u2013185</ref> Despite this official opening ceremony, minor work still remained to bring the extension to the standard required to run regular passenger trains, but regular train services began on 29 May 1976.<ref>Bate 2001, page 189</ref>\n\n[[File:Nant Gwernol footbridge - 2008-03-18.jpg|thumb|left|The footbridge across the Nant Gwernol]]\nAlthough the extension of the railway was completed in 1976, work in the vicinity continued with the creation of footpaths connecting to the new station. A new footbridge was built crossing the Nant Gwernol gorge and connecting the station with the existing path on the east side of the river. The bridge and paths were opened on 3 May 1980 by [[Gordon Parry, Baron Parry|Lord Parry]], the chairman of the [[Visit Wales|Wales Tourist Board]].<ref>{{cite journal |journal=Railway Times |page=11 |volume=18 |title=Narrow Gauge News-Centre |date=June 1980}}</ref> By the mid-1970s, it had become clear that passenger numbers were no longer increasing.

By 1987, the [[boiler]] on locomotive No. 6 ''Douglas'' was life expired and in need of replacement. Consideration was given to reviving the project to build a new locomotive from the components of ''Irish Pete'' instead of purchasing a new boiler for ''Douglas'' and in early 1988 work recommenced on the rebuilding of the ex-Bord na Mona locomotive. A new design for an 0-4-2 side tank locomotive was prepared by the railway's Chief Engineer John Bate, which reused the chassis and boiler from the locomotive with a new superstructure and the addition of trailing wheels, and the new locomotive, officially named ''[[Tom Rolt (locomotive)|Tom Rolt]]'' after the Preservation Society's first chairman, was put into service on 6 May 1991.<ref>Bate 2001, pages 234\u2013237</ref> During this period further expansions of both Tywyn Wharf and Pendre stations were undertaken and Abergynolwyn station, which had been rebuilt as part of the Nant Gwernol extension in the 1970s, was expanded further to provide an additional attraction at the eastern end of the line.<ref name=Thomas35>Thomas 2002, page 35</ref>\n\nOne major anomaly remained in the railway's operations: the 1889 [[Regulation of Railways Act 1889|Regulation of Railways Act]] had required, amongst other measures, that all British passenger trains be fitted with [[Brake (railway)#Continuous brakes|continuous brakes]].

When the line carried traffic from the quarry, slates were transferred to the [[Cambrian Railways]] on the [[transhipment]] sidings. Leaving Wharf station, which stands at an elevation of {{convert|40|ft|m|abbr=on}} above sea level, the line passes immediately under the A493 [[Machynlleth]] to [[Dolgellau]] road and enters a long [[Cutting (transportation)|cutting]] that climbs towards {{stnlnk|Pendre}}, at a maximum [[Grade (slope)#Railways|gradient]] of 1 in 60. On the left (north) side of the cutting there was once a long siding used for gravity [[Shunt (railway operations)|shunting]] of wagons into the sidings at Wharf station. The railway runs through the cutting for about {{convert|0.5|mi|m}}, before passing under another road bridge and passing the [[Motive power depot|locomotive and carriage sheds]] and works at Pendre.<ref name=Boyd6577/>\n\n[[File:Edward Thomas in Fathew Valley - 2008-03-18.jpg|thumb|left|A Talyllyn Railway train climbing eastwards along the Fathew Valley between {{stnlnk|Brynglas}} and {{stnlnk|Dolgoch}}]]\nFrom Pendre, the railway passes over a gated [[level crossing]] and runs beside an industrial estate before climbing up to Ty Mawr bridge and on to Hendy, the first of five [[Minor halts on the Talyllyn Railway|minor halts]], which serves the adjacent farm. The railway runs in an approximately north-easterly direction along the [[River Fathew|Fathew]] valley, mainly through fields of local farms on the valley floor, although this is where some of the steepest gradients on the line are to be found.<ref name=Potter226>Potter, page 226</ref> The [[ruling gradient]] of the line is 1 in 60.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.talyllyn.co.uk/history-building-railway|title=Talyllyn Railway history |accessdate=3 August 2009|publisher=Talyllyn Railway Company}}</ref>\n\nMore local halts follow at Fach Goch, and Cynfal, the latter having a small platform.<ref name=Potter226/> The section from Cynfal to {{stnlnk|Rhydyronen}} was relaid in 1951 using rail purchased from the Corris Railway after the latter line's closure in 1948. Rhydyronen, a [[request stop]], was the first intermediate station built on the line, opening in 1867. A siding at the station was shortened in 1957 and removed completely circa 1975. A short steep climb under a road bridge follows the station, followed by a slight downhill gradient. Unlike the Ffestiniog Railway, the Talyllyn was not designed to be worked as a gravity line, however this is the only downhill section between Pendre and Nant Gwernol.<ref>Potter, page 228</ref> Another minor halt follows at Tynllwynhen, before the passing loop and request stop at {{stnlnk|Brynglas}}.\n\n[[File:DolgochStation.JPG|thumb|right|Dolgoch station in 2006]]\nAbove Brynglas, the line crosses the Cwm Pandy stream and enters a shallow cutting, climbing as it goes. The cutting ends at a road overbridge after which the line runs through open countryside as it starts to ascend the valley side on a ledge. After approximately {{convert|0.75|mi|m}} it enters woodlands west of {{stnlnk|Dolgoch}}, climbing steadily, then curves to the south east and crosses the Dolgoch gorge on the Dolgoch viaduct, which carries the line {{convert|51|ft|m|abbr=on}} above the Dolgoch ravine.<ref>Boyd 1965, pages 82\u201383</ref> Dolgoch station is immediately east of the viaduct, situated on a left-hand curve at {{convert|187|ft|m|abbr=on}} above sea level, and is the main intermediate station on the line, being popular with tourists visiting the nearby [[Dolgoch Falls|falls]]. The railway continues in a north easterly direction, curving through the woods and climbing the valley side. It shortly passes Quarry Siding, where a halt and passing loop are located; this is the site of a small old [[shale]] quarry, the rock from which was used for [[Track ballast|ballasting]] on the railway. A large permanent way and storage shed opened on the site in 2013.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.talyllyn.co.uk/news/2013-may-guest-house-opening-quarry-siding|title=The 'Guest House' opening at Quarry Siding|publisher=Talyllyn Railway|date=13 May 2013|accessdate=2 February 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130819032219/http://talyllyn.co.uk/news/2013-may-guest-house-opening-quarry-siding|archivedate=19 August 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The line continues its ascent towards [[Abergynolwyn railway station|Abergynolwyn station]], situated on a ledge cut into the hillside.<ref>Boyd 1965, pages 83\u201384</ref>\n\n===Abergynolwyn to Nant Gwernol===\n[[File:Abergynolwyn Village Incline Map.svg|thumb|Map of the [[Abergynolwyn]] Village Branch]]\n\nThe original terminus of the statutory railway was Abergynolwyn, beyond which the railway continued as a {{convert|0.75|mi|km|adj=on}} long mineral extension, now converted for passenger use. The extension was originally sharply curved, as the line turns south east into the steeply sided Nant Gwernol gorge but these curves were eased when conversion for passenger use took place in 1976. The whole section is within woods, now owned by the [[Forestry Commission]]. Shortly after crossing over the forestry road the line reaches Ty Dwr, where the original locomotive shed stood from 1865 until it was demolished after Pendre works opened in 1867, although the slate water tower continued in use into the 1950s.<ref>Mitchell and Eyres 2005, page 70</ref>\n\nAfter passing the site of Ty Dwr the railway bends around 'Amen' corner and soon after the Village Incline is reached. From here the line runs into the gorge, high above the river on a narrow ledge, ending at the foot of the first incline leading to the Bryn Eglwys quarry. The original line fanned out into a set of three sidings, used to marshal trains of loaded slate wagons coming down from the quarry and empty wagons waiting to ascend.<ref>Boyd 1965, pages 84\u201386</ref> [[Nant Gwernol railway station|Nant Gwernol station]], the eastern terminus of the line, was built on the site of the sidings.\n\n[[File:VillageIncline.jpg|thumb|left|The village incline from the north west, around 1880]]\nThe village of [[Abergynolwyn]] was built to house the quarrymen of Bryn Eglwys and their families, and to serve the village an [[Cable railway|incline]] with winding house was laid three quarters of the way along the mineral extension. The winding house for the incline stood on the narrow ledge, with the mineral line passing through it. The two-track incline dropped {{convert|150|ft|m|abbr=on}} over a distance of {{convert|363|ft|m|abbr=on}}. At its foot, the line crossed the Nant Gwernol on a girder bridge. Immediately after the bridge, short lines branched off to the east from a wagon [[Turntable (railroad)|turntable]] to the coal yard and smithy of Pandy Farm and west to a [[slate (writing)|writing slate]] factory (later a carpenter's yard). The main branch then split to form a storage loop, with a further wagon turntable and a longer branch serving the houses and school to the north east. The main branch continued north, crossing the main road then passing between the two main terraces in the village before ending in a turntable and a final short line connecting to the Capel Jerusalem chapel.<ref>Boyd 1988, page 153\u2013162</ref> The village incline was lifted during the early years of preservation, to provide much needed rail to replace the existing track.<ref>Potter, page 126</ref> The winding house was demolished in 1968 to allow realignment of the railway to form the extension to Nant Gwernol.<ref name=Thomas34/>\n\n===Galltymoelfre Tramway===\n[[File:Cantrybedd incline - 2008-03-18.jpg|thumb|upright|The Cantrybedd Incline at the end of the Galltymoelfre Tramway]]\nUntil the closure of the quarries in 1946, the line east from Abergynolwyn was worked as a mineral tramway \u2013 only slate and goods trains serving Bryn Eglwys ran on this section. The quarry lay about {{convert|1|mile|km|spell=in}} south-east of Nant Gwernol station and {{convert|300|ft|m|abbr=on}} above it, with a further mineral tramway connecting the quarry with the railway.<ref name=Boyd88165/> What is now Nant Gwernol station was the terminus of the Talyllyn Railway proper. Here the line fanned out into a set of sidings where inbound trains were left and outbound slate trains assembled. The sidings were located on a narrow ledge in the side of the Nant Gwernol gorge.\n\nRising south-east from the end of the sidings was the {{convert|633|ft|m|abbr=on}} long, double track gravity operated, '''Alltwyllt incline''',<ref>Boyd 1988, page 162</ref> from the top of which the Galltymoelfre Tramway ran south-east towards the quarry for about {{convert|0.5|mi|m}}. The tramway was laid in light [[Rail profile#History|bridge rail]] and worked for its entire existence using horses. The tramway ended at the foot of the '''Cantrybedd incline''', a {{convert|440|ft|m|abbr=on}} long double track, gravity operated incline. This final incline rose to the north edge of Bryn Eglwys quarry, reaching a height of {{convert|612|ft|m|abbr=on}} above sea level.<ref name=Boyd88165>Boyd 1988, page 165</ref>\n\n==Operation==\n{{See also|List of Talyllyn Railway rolling stock}}\nThe line has six steam locomotives for passenger trains and four diesel locomotives, which are primarily used for shunting and to haul works trains. It is unusual for all steam locomotives to be operable at the same time, as at least one is normally scheduled for overhaul.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.talyllyn.co.uk/node/661 |title=Talyllyn website \u2013 100% availability |publisher=Talyllyn Railway Company |accessdate=6 September 2014 |date=29 August 2007 |author=Willans, Karen |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141221203929/http://www.talyllyn.co.uk/node/661 |archivedate=21 December 2014 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The railway also owns 23&nbsp;carriages and vans, including all of the original carriages and the brake van built for the railway.\n\n[[File:Dolgoch at Brynglas.jpg|thumb|left|''Dolgoch'' at Brynglas level crossing]]\nThe railway is [[Single track (rail)|single track]], so special measures have to be taken to prevent collisions. Before preservation, the railway operated a \"[[Signalling block systems|one engine in steam]]\" policy, but with growing passenger numbers it became necessary to install passing loops and a more stringent method of single line control was introduced.<ref>Potter, pages 130\u2013131</ref> The line is worked by Electric Key [[Token (railway signalling)|tokens]], which authorise the driver to enter a section of single line, and these are interlocked to prevent more than one token being withdrawn for a section at any one time. There is a loop at Pendre, which was used from the opening of the railway for shunting purposes, and further loops were installed at Brynglas in 1953 and Quarry Siding in 1963.<ref>Potter, pages 132\u2013133</ref> When the Nant Gwernol extension opened in 1976, Abergynolwyn also became a passing loop.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.talyllyn.co.uk/history/part-8-nant-gwernol-extension|title=History Part 8: The Nant Gwernol extension|publisher=Talyllyn Railway|accessdate=15 June 2019}}</ref>\n\nEach passing loop is controlled by a small [[signal box]], known as a block-post. These house the lever frames that control the points, the token equipment and telephones. The railway has few signals; instead it has stop boards at Pendre, Brynglas, Quarry Siding and Nant Gwernol, and the [[Signalman (rail)|blockman]] allows trains to proceed by use of flags.<ref>Potter, page 222</ref> There are colour light signals located at Tywyn Wharf, operated from the Control Office and disc signals controlled from the ground frame. Abergynolwyn has colour light signals, which are operated from the blockpost.<ref>Bate 2001, pages 128 & 186</ref> When the block-post is unmanned, it is the responsibility of the locomotive crew to change the token before proceeding.<ref>Rolt 1965, page 102</ref>\n\n==In popular culture==\nThe Talyllyn Railway is represented in ''[[The Railway Series]]'' books by the [[W.V. Awdry|Reverend W. Awdry]] and the spin-off TV series ''[[Thomas & Friends]]'' as the [[Skarloey Railway]]; most of the fictional locomotives are based on real-life equivalents. Awdry visited the line on a family holiday in the early days of preservation and became involved as a volunteer soon afterwards. Several of the stories in ''The Railway Series'' come from his real-life experiences at the Talyllyn, and some of the books contain full-page illustrations of Talyllyn locomotives.<ref>Potter, page 89</ref>\n\nThe preservation of the Talyllyn Railway by volunteers was the inspiration for the 1953 film ''[[The Titfield Thunderbolt]]'',<ref>Huntley 1969, page 77</ref> an [[Ealing Studios]] comedy about a group of villagers attempting to run a service on a disused [[branch line]] after closure. [[T. E. B. Clarke]], the script writer for the film, had heard about the preservation of the Talyllyn and spent a day on the railway in 1951, and some of the early incidents in preservation were incorporated into the film. In the book ''Railway Adventure'' Tom Rolt recalled that he had hoped the film might be produced on the Talyllyn,<ref>Rolt 1998, page 115</ref> but it was eventually filmed on the recently closed [[Camerton, Somerset|Camerton]] branch of the [[Bristol and North Somerset Railway]] branch line along the [[Cam Brook valley]] in [[Somerset]].<ref>Castens, page 5</ref>\n\nIn 1953, the American film producer [[Carson Davidson|Carson \"Kit\" Davidson]] produced a documentary film entitled ''Railway with a Heart of Gold'', portraying the early days of preservation. Some incidents were staged for the film, such as a piece falling off the locomotive, which Carson later described as \"corny\".<Ref name=Heart>Fuller, volume 2, pages 96-98</ref> However most of the film was simply a record of the work and incidents that took place on the railway at the time, including a dramatic shot of ''Sir Haydn'' derailing due to the poor condition of the track at the time.<Ref name=Heart/> The film ends with the quote\n\"It is a relic, this railway, a bit of ornamental scrollwork lifted from the pattern of yesterday and kept as a momento.\"<ref>Fuller, volume 2, page 330</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[British narrow gauge railways]]\n* [[List of 2 ft 3 in gauge railways]]\n* [[List of British heritage and private railways]]\n* [[Tourism in Wales]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist |group=lower-alpha}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|20em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* {{cite book|author=Bate, J.

Underground working began in the early 1840s,<ref name=AJR195>Richards 1999, page 195</ref> and by 1847 the quarry was being worked by local landowner John Pughe. The finished slates were sent by [[packhorse]] to the wharf at [[Pennal]], transferred to boats for a river trip to [[Aberdyfi]] (or the Anglicised Aberdovey still commonly used), and then finally loaded into seagoing vessels, a complex and expensive transportation arrangement which limited the quarry's output.<ref>Boyd 1965, pages 62\u201363</ref> In 1861 the outbreak of the [[American Civil War]] cut off supplies of [[cotton]] to the [[Cotton mill|mills]] of the north west of England and as a result a number of prosperous mill owners looked for new business opportunities to diversify their interests. One such owner was [[William McConnel]] of [[Lancashire]] who, in 1859, had purchased [[Hengwrt|Hengwrt Hall]] near [[Dolgellau]], north of Tywyn. In January 1864, McConnel formed the Aberdovey Slate Company, which leased the land including Bryn Eglwys from the landowner, Lewis Morris of [[Machynlleth]].<ref>Boyd 1988, page 9</ref>\n\n[[File:Bryn Eglwys quarry - 2008-03-18.jpg|thumb|left|The remains of Bryn Eglwys quarry in 2008|alt=Large spoil heaps of slate appear on the hillside in a heavily wooded area. In the foreground is a small stone house, without a roof.]]\nMcConnel set about improving Bryn Eglwys to increase its output. He focused on providing rail transport for the isolated quarry, and in April 1864 he reached agreement with local landowners to purchase the land necessary to build a railway towards Tywyn and onwards to the port of Aberdyfi. Construction was well underway by July 1864.<ref>Drummond 2015, page s 9-11</ref> The standard gauge [[Aberystwyth and Welsh Coast Railway]] was expanding rapidly from its base at Machynlleth, however, and in 1863 had reached Tywyn, so McConnel decided to build his line from the quarry to Tywyn, as the nearest point where slate could be transferred to the standard gauge railway. This was despite the line's initial isolation from the rest of the system because of difficulties in bridging the estuary of the [[Afon Dyfi]] to the south.<ref>Boyd 1965, page 64</ref> An [[Acts of Parliament in the United Kingdom|Act of Parliament]] (28 and 29&nbsp;[[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Vict]], cap cccxv) allowing the company to operate passenger trains as a public railway was given [[Royal Assent]] on 5 July 1865,<ref>Boyd 1988, page 45</ref><ref>Potter, page 11</ref> and the company appointed [[The Spooners of Porthmadog|James Swinton Spooner]] as engineer for the construction. He laid out plans for a relatively straight line climbing steadily from Tywyn to the quarry and work quickly got underway. By September 1866 construction had advanced to the point where the [[Board of Trade]] inspector [[Henry Whatley Tyler|Captain Henry Tyler]] could make an initial inspection and report.<ref>Boyd 1965, page 65</ref>\n\nTyler's report led to an unusual alteration, as it was discovered that the internal width of the [[Overpass#Railway|overbridges]] was only {{convert|9|ft|1|in|cm|abbr=on}}, but the railway's [[List of Talyllyn Railway rolling stock#Carriages|passenger carriages]] were {{convert|5|ft|3.5|in|cm|abbr=on}} wide, leaving only {{convert|1|ft|10+3/4|in|cm|abbr=on}}  clearance on either side, which was {{convert|7+3/4|in|cm|1|abbr=on}} less than the minimum required [[Engineering tolerance|clearance]] of {{convert|2|ft|6|in|cm|abbr=on}}. To alleviate this problem, McConnel proposed that the doors on one side of each carriage be permanently barred and the track slewed off-centre beneath the bridges to allow adequate clearance at least on the side with doors, which would allow passengers to get out of the carriages if the train stopped underneath a bridge. Tyler agreed to this arrangement, and to this day all carriages on the Talyllyn have doors on one side only, an unusual feature for a public railway which is shared (albeit for different reasons) with the neighbouring Corris Railway.<ref>Boyd 1965, pages 68\u201369</ref> Tyler also required that improvements be made to the railway's first two steam locomotives, as locomotive No.&nbsp;1 suffered from excessive \"vertical motion\" and No.&nbsp;2 was said to suffer from \"horizontal oscillation\". No.&nbsp;1 was returned to its manufacturer where a set of [[trailing wheel]]s was added to reduce the rear overhang, and the [[Suspension (vehicle)#Springs and dampers|springs]] on No.&nbsp;2 were adjusted and the [[crank pin]]s shortened to reduce its oscillation.<ref name=Boyd6570>Boyd 1965, page 70</ref>\n\nTyler did not approve the opening until his listed improvements were completed, although slate trains and unofficial passenger trains were running in 1865.<ref>Drummond 2015, page 17</ref> During November of that 1866, Tyler returned to Tywyn and re-inspected the railway following which, subject to some further minor improvements, he approved its formal opening for passenger service. The first public passenger timetable was issued in December 1866,<ref>Rolt 1998, page 13</ref> and the first purpose-built, steam-worked, narrow gauge public railway in Britain opened for service.<ref>Boyd 1965, pages 68\u201370</ref>\n\n===Prosperity under McConnel: 1866\u20131880s===\n[[File:TalyllynOnDolgochViaduct.jpg|thumb|right|''Talyllyn'' posed on Dolgoch Viaduct around 1867, the earliest known photograph of the Talyllyn|alt=A stone viaduct with three arches spans a steep sided ravine.

In 1867, the halt at {{stnlnk|Rhydyronen}} opened, followed by {{stnlnk|Brynglas}} and {{stnlnk|Dolgoch}} in 1873. Some time shortly after the opening of the railway a branch to Abergynolwyn village was provided. A steep [[cable railway|incline]] dropped from the mineral line east of Abergynolwyn station to the village below, where a series of tram lines radiated. Coal, building materials and general goods were delivered down the incline and the contents of the village [[cesspit]]s were hauled back up for disposal along the lineside.<ref name=Boyd6571/>\n\nThe railway used [[steam locomotive]]s from the start, unlike its neighbour the horse-drawn Corris Railway. The original two locomotives, although of entirely different design, were both purchased from [[Fletcher, Jennings & Co.]] of [[Whitehaven]] in [[Cumbria]],<ref>Rolt 1965, pages 82\u201383</ref> and both are still in service, 150&nbsp;years on, although so many of their parts have been replaced down the years that much of their present-day component metal is not original. The Talyllyn's rare gauge is thought to have been adopted to match that of the Corris Railway,<ref>Rolt 1998, pages 5\u20136</ref> and the line's two original steam locomotives were among the earliest locomotives built for such a narrow gauge. No.&nbsp;1 ''[[Talyllyn (locomotive)|Talyllyn]]'' is an {{whyte|0-4-2|ST}} and No.&nbsp;2 ''[[Dolgoch (locomotive)|Dolgoch]]'' is an {{whyte|0-4-0|WT}}. The line carried slate from the quarry to the wharf at Tywyn and general goods along its length. Public passenger trains initially ran between Abergynolwyn, Dolgoch and Pendre stations only; quarrymen were carried on unofficial trains that continued on from Abergynolwyn to the foot of the Alltwyllt incline in Nant Gwernol gorge.<ref name=Boyd6571/>\n\nThe line operated successfully during its early years, serving the quarry and the local district. By 1880, Bryn Eglwys employed 300&nbsp;workers and was producing {{convert|8000|long ton}} of finished slate per year, all shipped via the railway.<ref name=AJR195/> Passenger traffic was substantial, rising from 11,500&nbsp;passengers carried in 1867 to over 23,000 (roughly equivalent to 40,000&nbsp;passenger journeys) in 1877.<ref>Boyd 1965, page 118</ref>\n\n===Declining fortunes: 1880s\u20131910===\n[[File:TalyllynAtNantGwernol1890.jpg|thumb|right|''Talyllyn'' at the foot of the Alltwyllt incline, the present site of Nant Gwernol station, 1890|alt=A train consisting of a locomotive and single carriage stands in the centre track of three tracks, which is on a ledge on a steep hillside.

This used [[charabanc]]s to link the Talyllyn and Corris railways via Tal-y-llyn Lake and Cadair Idris, returning on [[Cambrian Railways]] trains.<ref>Rolt 1998, pages 24\u201325</ref> The last two decades of the 19th century saw a decline in the demand for slate and many smaller quarries fell on hard times, including Bryn Eglwys, where by 1890 production had halved to {{convert|4000|long ton}} a year.<ref name=AJR195/> In 1896, production at the [[Penrhyn Quarry]] in north Wales, one of the largest producers of slate, was stopped due to labour disputes, resulting in a temporary increase in demand at other quarries. McConnel expanded production at Bryn Eglwys to take advantage of the sudden demand, but only with the aim of maximising profits during the remainder of his lease, which was to expire in 1910. He built new trial levels without proper provision for the removal of [[overburden]] and pushed the limits of safe working in the existing chambers. As McConnel's lease drew to its close, there was no prospect of a further lessee coming forward and work began on dismantling the quarry's equipment.<ref name=Boyd6572/>\n\n===Haydn Jones era: 1911\u20131950===\nThe Bryn Eglwys quarry was the primary employer in the Abergynolwyn district, so its closure caused significant distress. In 1910, local landowner [[Henry Haydn Jones]] was elected the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] [[Member of Parliament#United Kingdom|MP]] for [[Merionethshire|Merioneth]]. He understood the importance of Bryn Eglwys, and at the end of the year he purchased the quarry company for just over \u00a35000.<ref name=\"Quine Haydn Jones\">{{cite article |last=Quine |first=Dan |authorlink=Dan Quine |title=The Talyllyn Railway in the late Haydn Jones era |publisher=Heritage Railway |volume=200 |date=March 2015}}</ref> The quarry re-opened in January 1911,<ref name=Boyd6572>Boyd 1965, pages 72\u201373</ref> though Haydn Jones did not have [[capital (economics)|capital]] to invest in the quarry. The first workings reopened were on the [[Broad Vein]], which yielded relatively hard slate that was less popular and therefore difficult to sell. The lack of an available market for this output forced the quarry to switch to extracting softer slate from the [[Narrow Vein]] but, because Haydn Jones could not afford to open new workings into the Narrow Vein, he resorted to the dangerous practice of narrowing the columns that supported the roofs of the underground chambers. This practice had begun under McConnel's ownership and Haydn Jones continued it throughout his ownership of the quarry.<ref name=Boyd6572/> A brief construction boom after the [[First World War]] saw production return to around {{convert|4000|long ton}} per year.<ref name=AJR195/>\n\nThe 1920s also saw an upsurge in holiday traffic, as Britain recovered from the war and tourism gained in popularity. The Talyllyn saw summer passenger numbers grow significantly and regularly had to supplement its formal passenger stock with slate wagons fitted with planks as seats.<ref>Ransom 1996, page 130</ref> An unusual tourist service offered by the railway was to hire a slate wagon, which would be left at Abergynolwyn. At the end of the day the tourists would return to Tywyn in the wagon, powered by [[Gravity railway|gravity]]. This service was discontinued in the early 1930s.<ref>Boyd 1965, pages 116\u2013117</ref> The additional income from the tourist trade defrayed some of the costs of operating the railway, but never enough for it to make a profit during Haydn Jones' ownership.\n\nThe lease on Bryn Eglwys expired in 1942, but was extended on an annual basis. The October 1942 Bradshaw's Guide shows two return passenger trains operating only on Monday, Wednesday and Fridays, taking 45 minutes in each direction. No passenger service was provided on other days. Overnight on 26 December 1946, several weakened support columns in the quarry gave way, resulting in a significant collapse; the quarry was deemed unsafe and closed immediately. Haydn Jones had promised to continue operating the railway as long as he was alive and so, despite the closure of the quarry, the railway continued to run trains on a shoestring budget. In 1947 the British railway system was nationalised and the Talyllyn was one of the few operating railways not included. The reasons for this are unclear, but it is significant that all official mention of the railway had ceased several decades before and it is likely that the line was simply forgotten by officialdom.<ref>Boyd 1965, pages 73\u201374</ref> Between 1947 and 1949 the railway ran a passenger service two days a week. In 1949 Haydn Jones, who owned the [[Aberllefenni Slate Quarry]] purchased 10 tons of rail from the recently lifted Corris Railway.<ref name=Quine>{{cite article |title=Not to be: The sad end of the Corris Railway |publisher=Heritage Railway |volume=220 |last=Quine |first=Dan |authorlink=Dan Quine}}</ref> On 2 July 1950 Haydn Jones died and closure of the railway seemed inevitable, but the line continued to operate for the remainder of the summer season, ending on 6 October.<ref>Boyd 1965, page 74</ref>\n{{clear}}\n\n==Preservation==\n===Rescue: 1951\u20131960===\n[[File:Tal-Y-Llyn Dolgoch Abergwynolwn 1951.jpg|thumb|right|Locomotive No. 2 ''Dolgoch'' at Abergynolwyn in 1951, early in the preservation era|alt=A small steam locomotive stands beside a banked area.

Rolt|Tom Rolt]], visited the line in 1949, along with the locomotive engineer [[David Curwen]].<ref>Potter, page 59</ref> In the summer of 1950, Rolt wrote a letter to the ''[[Birmingham Post]]'' newspaper suggesting that a rescue of the Talyllyn be undertaken. He received sufficient positive response for a meeting of interested enthusiasts to be held on 11 October 1950 at the Imperial Hotel in Birmingham. Around 70&nbsp;people, including [[Patrick Whitehouse]], attended the meeting, with Rolt proposing the formation of a committee to look into the acquisition of the railway. With the support of the meeting, the committee \u2013 with Rolt as chairman and Whitehouse as Secretary \u2013 met for the first time on 23 October and immediately entered into negotiation with Haydn Jones' executors.<ref>Rolt 1965, pages 52\u201353</ref>\n\nThe transfer of ownership to the committee was legally complex, but both parties agreed that all shares in the railway company would be transferred from Haydn Jones' estate to a new company called Talyllyn Holdings Ltd., whose board consisted of two directors from the executors and two from the committee. The transfer took place on 8 February 1951, at which point the newly formed Talyllyn Railway Preservation Society effectively took control of the railway. The Society immediately began to publicise its efforts, hoping to raise funds and find further volunteers to help reopen the railway, and by May nearly 650&nbsp;members had joined the society.<ref>Rolt 1965, pages 54\u201355</ref> The railway re-opened under the control of the Society for the first time on the [[Whit Monday]] bank holiday, 14 May 1951,<ref name=Potter78>Potter, page 78</ref> with trains running between Wharf and Rhydyronen stations.

When the line was taken over in 1950 ''[[Dolgoch (locomotive)|Dolgoch]]'' was the only operating locomotive and it was apparent that it was in need of a major overhaul. To enable operations to continue two further steam locomotives, Nos.&nbsp;3 and 4, were purchased from the recently closed Corris Railway in 1951 and named ''[[Sir Haydn (locomotive)|Sir Haydn]]'' and ''[[Edward Thomas (locomotive)|Edward Thomas]]'' respectively. Because both railways were built to the unusual gauge of {{Track gauge|2ft3in}}  it was relatively easy to adapt the Corris locomotives to work on the Talyllyn. No.&nbsp;3 became the first new locomotive to travel on the railway for over 80&nbsp;years in 1951, but it frequently [[Derailment|derailed]], and on inspection it turned out that the Talyllyn track was laid approximately half an inch (13&nbsp;mm) wider than the official gauge, a deliberate policy by the old company to accommodate the long [[wheelbase]] of ''Talyllyn''. Both ''Talyllyn'' and ''Dolgoch'' had unusually wide wheel treads that allowed them to stay on the wide-of-gauge track. This problem was eventually cured by relaying the railway to its correct gauge and altering ''Talyllyn'''s trailing wheels to allow them to swivel horizontally, shortening the locomotive's fixed wheelbase.<ref>Boyd 1988, page 260</ref> No.&nbsp;4 was unserviceable when it arrived, but John Alcock,<ref>Rolt 1998, picture facing page 109</ref> the chairman of the [[Hunslet Engine Company]], was a member of the Preservation Society and had No.&nbsp;4 overhauled free of charge at his works.<ref>Johnson 1997, page 57</ref> No.&nbsp;4 then began service on the railway in 1952 and worked the majority of the trains that season.<ref>Rolt 1998, page 132</ref>\n\n[[File:Guinness loco at NGRM - 2008-03-18.jpg|thumb|right|The Guinness brewery locomotive, the first exhibit donated to the Narrow Gauge Railway Museum|alt=A small green tank steam locomotive of unusual design, number 13, stands in the museum.

This locomotive was built for the [[British military narrow gauge railways|depot railway]] serving [[RAF Calshot]] where it worked until 1945, and, after rebuilding from its original {{Track gauge|2ft|lk=on}}  gauge, it entered service in 1954.<ref>Boyd 1965, pages 99\u2013100</ref> Through the 1950s the volunteers and staff members of the TRPS rebuilt the line and rescued it from its state of decay, during a period characterised by a \"[[Boy's Own Paper|''Boy's Own'' comic]] spirit of adventure, involving enthusiasm, ingenuity and a fair degree of irresponsibility\".<ref>Goddin 2002, page 46</ref>\n\nOn 22 May 1957 the [[BBC]] produced a live [[Outside broadcasting|outside broadcast]] from the railway, during which [[Wynford Vaughan Thomas]] and [[Huw Weldon]] commentated on a trip from Dolgoch to Abergynolwyn. The publicity from this broadcast drew substantial numbers of visitors to the railway that summer, with more than 57,500&nbsp;passengers carried, and this increase in revenue in turn enabled the railway to continue to improve its infrastructure and provide tourists with a better experience.<ref>Rolt 1965, pages 61\u201362</ref> The following year locomotive No.&nbsp;1 ''Talyllyn'' returned to steam after an extensive overhaul.<ref>Mitchell and Eyres, 2005 page 25</ref>\n\nAn important development during this period was the establishment of the [[Narrow Gauge Railway Museum]] at Tywyn Wharf station. The first exhibit for what was to become the museum was a locomotive donated in 1952 by [[Diageo|Guinness]] from their recently closed [[St. James's Gate Brewery]] railway. In 1954 the Preservation Society agreed to start work on a formal museum and exhibits from around the United Kingdom were acquired to form the nucleus of the collection. In 1955 work started on converting the old [[gunpowder magazine|gunpowder store]] at Wharf station into a temporary museum building, and in 1956 the first exhibit arrived at Tywyn.<ref>Rolt 1965, pages 112\u2013114</ref>\n\n===Securing the infrastructure: 1960\u20131969===\n[[File:Tywyn Wharf layout 1964.svg|thumb|left|Tywyn Wharf station in 1964, after layout improvements|alt=The British Railways main line runs in south-easterly direction from Barmouth to Aberdyfi.

The most southerly of the sidings curves round to join a line that runs parallel to the main line.]]\n\nThe 1960s proved to be a decade of consolidation for the Talyllyn. Pendre works underwent several much-needed expansions, adding additional covered storage for carriages and more workshop room. Modern machine tools, along with proper lighting and a new power supply were added. Substantial improvements to Tywyn Wharf station were also made, along with continued relaying and upgrading of the track to Abergynolwyn.<ref>Bate 2001, chapter 5</ref> Passenger numbers continued to climb after the 1957 BBC broadcast; in 1960, 67,000&nbsp;passenger journeys were made, increasing to 78,500 in 1964.<ref>Rolt 1965, page 99</ref> In response to this growing popularity the railway undertook a programme of new rolling stock construction.\n\nBy the early 1960s Tywyn Wharf station was in need of major improvements. Before preservation, the station had contained only a fan of sidings, which meant that there was no way for the locomotive of an arriving train to run round the carriages. As a result, trains were pushed from behind as far as Pendre, where the locomotive could be moved past the carriages to the front of the train. A [[passing loop|loop]] was installed at Wharf for the first time in August 1952, to avoid having to propel trains to Pendre,<ref name=Boyd6577>Boyd 1965, page 77</ref> but in the winter of 1964/65 a major upgrade of the station was carried out. This improved the track layout and extended the original office building to provide covered accommodation for passengers and a shop.<ref>Mitchell and Eyres, 2005 page 19</ref>\n\nAs passenger numbers continued to grow during the late 1960s it became clear that further motive power was needed, especially as the rebuilt No.&nbsp;1 was not performing well. The Talyllyn's unusual track gauge and restricted loading gauge meant that it was unlikely that a locomotive could be found that could work on the line unaltered,<ref>Mitchell and Eyres, 2005 page 87</ref> so in 1969 a {{Track gauge|3ft|lk=on}}  gauge steam locomotive was purchased from the [[Bord na Mona]] (Irish Peat Board) with a view to rebuilding it for use on the Talyllyn. This locomotive was unofficially known as ''Irish Pete'', a nod to its original use.<ref>Bate 2001, page 155</ref>\n{{clear}}\n\n===Extension to Nant Gwernol: 1969\u20131980===\n[[File:Alltwyllt incline - 2008-03-18.jpg|thumb|right|The head of the Alltwyllt incline at the end of the Nant Gwernol extension in 2008]]\nThe preservation society had long held ambitions to extend the railway along the former mineral extension from Abergynolwyn to the foot of the Alltwyllt incline, and as early as 1959 work had begun to trace the owners of the land that the extension traversed.

By 1987, the [[boiler]] on locomotive No. 6 ''Douglas'' was life expired and in need of replacement. Consideration was given to reviving the project to build a new locomotive from the components of ''Irish Pete'' instead of purchasing a new boiler for ''Douglas'' and in early 1988 work recommenced on the rebuilding of the ex-Bord na Mona locomotive. A new design for an 0-4-2 side tank locomotive was prepared by the railway's Chief Engineer John Bate, which reused the chassis and boiler from the locomotive with a new superstructure and the addition of trailing wheels, and the new locomotive, officially named ''[[Tom Rolt (locomotive)|Tom Rolt]]'' after the Preservation Society's first chairman, was put into service on 6 May 1991.<ref>Bate 2001, pages 234\u2013237</ref> During this period further expansions of both Tywyn Wharf and Pendre stations were undertaken and Abergynolwyn station, which had been rebuilt as part of the Nant Gwernol extension in the 1970s, was expanded further to provide an additional attraction at the eastern end of the line.<ref name=Thomas35>Thomas 2002, page 35</ref>\n\nOne major anomaly remained in the railway's operations: the 1889 [[Regulation of Railways Act 1889|Regulation of Railways Act]] had required, amongst other measures, that all British passenger trains be fitted with [[Brake (railway)#Continuous brakes|continuous brakes]].

When the line carried traffic from the quarry, slates were transferred to the [[Cambrian Railways]] on the [[transhipment]] sidings. Leaving Wharf station, which stands at an elevation of {{convert|40|ft|m|abbr=on}} above sea level, the line passes immediately under the A493 [[Machynlleth]] to [[Dolgellau]] road and enters a long [[Cutting (transportation)|cutting]] that climbs towards {{stnlnk|Pendre}}, at a maximum [[Grade (slope)#Railways|gradient]] of 1 in 60. On the left (north) side of the cutting there was once a long siding used for gravity [[Shunt (railway operations)|shunting]] of wagons into the sidings at Wharf station.

A short steep climb under a road bridge follows the station, followed by a slight downhill gradient. Unlike the Ffestiniog Railway, the Talyllyn was not designed to be worked as a gravity line, however this is the only downhill section between Pendre and Nant Gwernol.<ref>Potter, page 228</ref> Another minor halt follows at Tynllwynhen, before the passing loop and request stop at {{stnlnk|Brynglas}}.\n\n[[File:DolgochStation.JPG|thumb|right|Dolgoch station in 2006]]\nAbove Brynglas, the line crosses the Cwm Pandy stream and enters a shallow cutting, climbing as it goes.

The railway continues in a north easterly direction, curving through the woods and climbing the valley side. It shortly passes Quarry Siding, where a halt and passing loop are located; this is the site of a small old [[shale]] quarry, the rock from which was used for [[Track ballast|ballasting]] on the railway.

The extension was originally sharply curved, as the line turns south east into the steeply sided Nant Gwernol gorge but these curves were eased when conversion for passenger use took place in 1976. The whole section is within woods, now owned by the [[Forestry Commission]]. Shortly after crossing over the forestry road the line reaches Ty Dwr, where the original locomotive shed stood from 1865 until it was demolished after Pendre works opened in 1867, although the slate water tower continued in use into the 1950s.<ref>Mitchell and Eyres 2005, page 70</ref>\n\nAfter passing the site of Ty Dwr the railway bends around 'Amen' corner and soon after the Village Incline is reached. From here the line runs into the gorge, high above the river on a narrow ledge, ending at the foot of the first incline leading to the Bryn Eglwys quarry. The original line fanned out into a set of three sidings, used to marshal trains of loaded slate wagons coming down from the quarry and empty wagons waiting to ascend.<ref>Boyd 1965, pages 84\u201386</ref> [[Nant Gwernol railway station|Nant Gwernol station]], the eastern terminus of the line, was built on the site of the sidings.\n\n[[File:VillageIncline.jpg|thumb|left|The village incline from the north west, around 1880]]\nThe village of [[Abergynolwyn]] was built to house the quarrymen of Bryn Eglwys and their families, and to serve the village an [[Cable railway|incline]] with winding house was laid three quarters of the way along the mineral extension.

The two-track incline dropped {{convert|150|ft|m|abbr=on}} over a distance of {{convert|363|ft|m|abbr=on}}. At its foot, the line crossed the Nant Gwernol on a girder bridge. Immediately after the bridge, short lines branched off to the east from a wagon [[Turntable (railroad)|turntable]] to the coal yard and smithy of Pandy Farm and west to a [[slate (writing)|writing slate]] factory (later a carpenter's yard). The main branch then split to form a storage loop, with a further wagon turntable and a longer branch serving the houses and school to the north east.

Awdry visited the line on a family holiday in the early days of preservation and became involved as a volunteer soon afterwards.

[[T. E. B. Clarke]], the script writer for the film, had heard about the preservation of the Talyllyn and spent a day on the railway in 1951, and some of the early incidents in preservation were incorporated into the film.

In the Eastern sea, there appears a giant Fish called Ng\u01b0 Tinh  (Vietnamese for \"fish monster\" or \"fish spirit\"). This fish has lived for centuries, with the size of its mouth, it can consume a ship with 10 fisherman at the same time. Whenever the Fish swim, waves can reach the sky, drown multiple ships, all the people passing through the area were all eaten by the fish. Ng\u01b0 Tinh  lives in a big cave under the sea, above the cave is a huge mountain which divide the sea into two areas.\n\nL\u1ea1c Long Qu\u00e2n decided to slay the beast to help the people. He built a huge ship, made a burning human-shaped piece of metal, then sailed straight to Ng\u01b0 Tinh nest. There he held the human-shaped piece of metal up to trick Ng\u01b0 Tinh. Ng\u01b0 Tinh thought it was a human than opened its mouth and tried to swallow to burning metal. Qu\u00e2n threw the burning metal into Ng\u01b0 Tinh's mouth. Ng\u01b0 Tinh 's throat was burning, it struggled but tried to sink Qu\u00e2n's ship. Qu\u00e2n then took his sword out and slew the beast, slicing it into three pieces.\n\n'''Slaying of the nine-tailed fox '''\n\nAfter slaying Ng\u01b0 Tinh, Qu\u00e2n went down to Long Bi\u00ean. There appears a [[nine-tailed fox]] that live for thousand years, called H\u1ed3 Tinh (Vietnamese for \"fox monster\" or \"fox spirit\"). The fox lived in a deep cave, under a rock mountain in the West Long Bi\u00ean. This fox often disguised into human shape, lure the women, then bring them to the cave and feed on them. This fox has been harassing people from Long Bi\u00ean to T\u1ea3n Vi\u00ean mountain.

In the Eastern sea, there appears a giant Fish called Ng\u01b0 Tinh  (Vietnamese for \"fish monster\" or \"fish spirit\"). This fish has lived for centuries, with the size of its mouth, it can consume a ship with 10 fisherman at the same time. Whenever the Fish swim, waves can reach the sky, drown multiple ships, all the people passing through the area were all eaten by the fish. Ng\u01b0 Tinh  lives in a big cave under the sea, above the cave is a huge mountain which divide the sea into two areas.\n\nL\u1ea1c Long Qu\u00e2n decided to slay the beast to help the people. He built a huge ship, made a burning human-shaped piece of metal, then sailed straight to Ng\u01b0 Tinh nest. There he held the human-shaped piece of metal up to trick Ng\u01b0 Tinh. Ng\u01b0 Tinh thought it was a human than opened its mouth and tried to swallow to burning metal. Qu\u00e2n threw the burning metal into Ng\u01b0 Tinh's mouth. Ng\u01b0 Tinh 's throat was burning, it struggled but tried to sink Qu\u00e2n's ship. Qu\u00e2n then took his sword out and slew the beast, slicing it into three pieces.\n\n'''Slaying of the nine-tailed fox '''\n\nAfter slaying Ng\u01b0 Tinh, Qu\u00e2n went down to Long Bi\u00ean. There appears a [[nine-tailed fox]] that live for thousand years, called H\u1ed3 Tinh (Vietnamese for \"fox monster\" or \"fox spirit\"). The fox lived in a deep cave, under a rock mountain in the West Long Bi\u00ean. This fox often disguised into human shape, lure the women, then bring them to the cave and feed on them. This fox has been harassing people from Long Bi\u00ean to T\u1ea3n Vi\u00ean mountain. The innocents were so afraid of the fox that they have to leave their homes, farms to other places in order to live peacefully. Qu\u00e2n brought his sword to the beast's nest and tried to slay the beast. When Qu\u00e2n reached the cave, the fox smelled human, then suddenly attacked, Qu\u00e2n then used magic to call the elements of wind and thunders to trap the beast.
