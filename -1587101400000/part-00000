They were a Karuneegar family in Marudhur, a village in the old  [[South Arcot|South Arcot district]], near [[Chidambaram]].  R\u0101malingam was their fifth child. The older ones were two sons Sabhapati and Parasu R\u0101man; and two daughters, Sundarammal and Unnamulai. They named their youngest child R\u0101malingam.\n\n===Childhood and divine experiences===\nOnce, R\u0101malingam's parents went to the [[Chidambaram Temple|Chidambaram Natar\u0101jar Temple]] with their five month old child, and the infant was joyous while the [[priest]]  was offering  [[Archana (Hinduism)|Deepa aradhana]] (adoration by lighted lamp being brought close to the vigrahams); this was perceived by R\u0101malingam as a deep spiritual experience. In later years he said of the experience:\n\n:\"No sooner the Light was perceived, happiness prevailed on me\", and\n\n:\"The sweet nectar was tasted by me as soon as the Arut perun jothi (Supreme Grace Of Light) became visible\".<ref>[http://www.textbooksonline.tn.nic.in/Books/08/SocSci-EM/History/chapter_6.pdf Arutperunjothi] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080916051722/http://www.textbooksonline.tn.nic.in/Books/08/SocSci-EM/History/chapter_6.pdf |date=2008-09-16 }}, Tamil Nadu Text books online</ref>\n\nIn 1824, his father R\u0101mayy\u0101 pillai died. Because of his untimely demise, Chinnammai shifted her residence to her mother's place at Chinna k\u0101vanam, Ponneri. Saint R\u0101malingam was a small child when he relocated with his mother to Chennai in 1826. He and his mother lived  with his eldest brother Sabhapati and his wife P\u0101pp\u0101thi at 31/14 Veerasamy Pillai Street at [[Sevenwells]] area of [[Chennai]], which is in the area near [[Kandaswami Temple, Georgetown|Chennai Kandha kottam Kandha sw\u0101mi temple.]] After R\u0101malingam reached five years of age, Sabhapati initiated his [[formal education]]. But the young child was not interested in that, instead he preferred trips to the nearby Kandha sw\u0101mi temple. Sabhapati thought that the child needed punishment as a form of discipline, and  he told his wife not to  give R\u0101malingam his daily meal. His kind sister-in-law, however, secretly gave him food and persuaded him to study seriously at home. God gave food before sister in law gave food. In return, R\u0101malingam asked  for his own room, lighted lamp and mirror.  He placed the light in front of the mirror. He started [[meditation]] by concentrating on the light and thus began the young boy's spiritual life. He miraculously saw a vision of the [[Murugan|Lord Muruga]]. R\u0101malingam said:\n\n:\"The beauty endowed divine faces six, the illustrious shoulders twelve.\"<ref>Lakshmi Devnath, [http://www.hinduonnet.com/2001/02/02/stories/1302136a.htm \"Compassion is the essence of Saint R\u0101malingam's philosophy\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110107124551/http://www.hinduonnet.com/2001/02/02/stories/1302136a.htm |date=2011-01-07 }}, ''The Hindu'', February 2, 2001</ref>\n\nAt one time, R\u0101malingam had to replace his elder brother Sabhapati at an [[Katha (storytelling format)|upany\u0101sam]] (religious stories) session as up\u0101sakar. His great discourse on verses from the `[[Periya Puranam|Periya pur\u0101nam]]', an epic poem by [[Sekkizhar]] about the saintly '63 [[Nayanars|N\u0101yan\u0101rs]]', was appreciated by the devotees as being given by a very learned scholar. R\u0101malingam's mental and spiritual growth progressed rapidly. R\u0101malingam says thanks to the [[divinity|Divine]] by:\n\n:\"Effulgent flame of grace, that lit in me intelligence, to know untaught.\"<ref>[http://www.Vallalar.org/WebComponents/FrontPage.aspx?ViewName=enBlogs&WebSiteId=1&ConId=294 Early life of Saint Vallal\u0101r]{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nR\u0101malingam evolved in his spiritual journey from being a devout devotee of [[Shiva|Lord Shiva]] to worshipping the formless.\n\nR\u0101malingam renounced the world at the young age of thirteen. But he was forced to marry his niece (on his sister's side). Legends say that the [[bridegroom]] during his first night after marriage was reading devotional works like the [[Tiruvasakam|Thiru v\u0101sagam]]. He was not interested in money, and it is said that in later life he reduced or ignored eating and sleeping. But he seemed fit in body, which was possibly due to his supposed physical transformation.\n\n==Teachings==\n[[File:Sathya gnana sabha, vadalur 2.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Heaps of grain bags at [[Satyagnana Sabha, Vadalur|Sathya gnana sabha, Vadalur]] - established by R\u0101malinga adigal ]]\nAt the age of 35 he left Chennai during the year 1858. First he went to [[Chidambaram]] where he had a debate with Kodakanallur Sundara Sw\u0101migal. At the request of one R\u0101makrishna Reddiyar he went to his house at [[Karunguzhi]] and stayed there for 9 years. He was very much against the [[caste|caste system]] because of the adverse impacts it had on society. Towards that end, he started the \"Samarasa  Vedha Sanmarga Sangam\" in 1865. In 1872 it was renamed \"Samarasa Suddha Sanmarga Sathya Sangam\",<ref name=\"ambalamyoga.org\" /> meaning \"Society for pure truth in universal self-hood\".\n\nIn 1867, he established a  facility serving free food named \"The Sathya Dharma Salai\"<ref>[http://www.Vallalarspace.com/VallalarGroups/ Image of Sathya Dharma Salai]</ref> in [[Vadalur]]. There all people are served free food without any caste distinctions. The land for the facility was donated by kind, generous people and those registered documents are available for seeing by the visitors. The free facility continues its service till the present time. R\u0101malinga disliked people eating [[non-vegetarian]] foods, about which he said:<blockquote>When I see men feeding on the coarse and vicious food of meat, it is an ever-recurring grief to me.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.hinduonnet.com/2001/02/02/stories/1302136a.htm |title=\"The Hindu\" article on Vallal\u0101r |access-date=2008-06-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110107124551/http://www.hinduonnet.com/2001/02/02/stories/1302136a.htm |archive-date=2011-01-07 |url-status=dead }}</ref></blockquote>\n \n[[File:Sathya gnana sabha, vadalur 3.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Entrance to the Sathya Gnana Sabha. The sign above it reads \"only those who have renounced meat and murder should enter\"]]\nOn January 25th of 1872, R\u0101malingam opened the \"[[Satyagnana Sabha, Vadalur|Sathya Gnana Sabha]]\" (Hall of True Knowledge) at [[Vadalur]]. One of the primary teachings of Valallar is \"[[community service|Service]] to [[Human beings|Living Beings]] is the path of [[Moksha|Liberation/ Moksha]]\". He declared that death is not natural that our life's first priority should be to fight death. He declared religion in itself a darkness. He laid a very great emphasis on being vegetarian. He said God is \"Arul Perum Jothi\" who is personification of Grace or mercy and knowledge. He said the path of compassion and mercy are the only path to God.\n\nIn 1867 he established a center for feeding the poor people. On the inaugural day he lit the fire of the stone stove, with a declaration that the fire be ever alive and the needy shall be fed forever. Around 1872 he established the \"Sathya Gnana Sabai\", hall of True Wisdom Forum and ensuring it was entirely secular. This place is not a [[temple]]; fruits, flowers are not offered, and no blessings were given. It was open to people of all castes except those who ate meat, who were only allowed to worship from the outside. He wrote in detail about the ''pooja'' to be performed in Gn\u0101na sabai. Those who are below 12 years or those who are above 72 years alone were expected to enter Gn\u0101na sabai and do ''poojas''. The oil lamp lit by him is kept perpetually burning. He said that [[soul]]s are blinded by seven veils.<ref>[https://www.vallalyaar.com/enquiry-on-truth-satvisaaram-vallalar/] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110409135431/http://www.ambalamyoga.org/On%20Vallalar%20by%20Arul%20file.pdf |date=2011-04-09 }}</ref>\n \nThere are seven cotton fabric screens, representing the seven factors that prevent a soul from realizing its truth.

He said the intelligence we possess is [[Maya (religion)|Maya]] intelligence which is not true and final intelligence. The path of final intelligence is ''Jeeva Karunyam''. Looking other souls with compassion, also own soul from birth and death. He advocated a [[Caste in India|casteless society]]. Vallal\u0101r was opposed to [[superstition]]s and rituals. He forbade killing animals for the sake of food. He advocated feeding the poor as the highest form of worship. He condemned inequality based on birth.

He attained a total of 3 transformations (i.e. transformations into Pure Body, Pranava (Sound) Body, and Gnostic Body). His first transformation was the transformation of his normal human body into the Perfect Body. The supposed attributes of this body are total invulnerability to everything thus rendering him effectively immortal and impervious to any kind of damage as well as having the attributes of being omnipotent, omnipresent and omniscient, this body is apparently made of Divine Light.\n\nBeyond this state there was a subsequent transformation by which the Perfect Body transformed further into the Grace Body possessing the following attributes: This body has automatically a young appearance like that of a child, can be seen but can't be touched, and has complete and absolute dominion over all the [[Siddhis]].\n\nEven beyond the State of the Grace Body supposedly there was a third and final transformation in which the Grace Body was transformed into the Bliss Body. This body is the body of the Supreme Godhead and is automatically omnipresent but can't be perceived by anyone.\n\nBy achieving this R\u0101malingam demonstrated that the ultimate states of spirituality can in fact be attained in this world with the physical body and death is not a necessity to experience the ultimate spiritual experience.\n\n==Disappearance==\nOn October 22, 1873, R\u0101malingam raised the ''flag of Brotherhood''{{what|date=October 2018}} on his one-room residence ''Siddhi Val\u0101gam'' in Mettukuppam.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.hinduonnet.com/2001/02/02/stories/1302136a.htm |title=Article in \"The Hindu\" narration on Siddhi Valakam |access-date=2008-06-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110107124551/http://www.hinduonnet.com/2001/02/02/stories/1302136a.htm |archive-date=2011-01-07 |url-status=dead }}</ref> He gave his final and most popular lecture, about spiritual progress and, \"nature of the powers that lie beyond us and move us,\" and recommended meditation using the lighted lamp from his room, which he then kept outside.\n\nOn January 30, 1874, R\u0101malingam entered the room, locked himself inside and told his followers not to open it. After opening, he said, he will not be found there. (He will be \"United with Nature & ruling the actions of 'all of the alls',\" as told in his poem called 'Gnana Sariyai'). His seclusion spurred many rumors, and the Government finally forced the doors open in May. The room was empty, with no clues.

They were a Karuneegar family in Marudhur, a village in the old  [[South Arcot|South Arcot district]], near [[Chidambaram]].  R\u0101malingam was their fifth child.

He and his mother lived  with his eldest brother Sabhapati and his wife P\u0101pp\u0101thi at 31/14 Veerasamy Pillai Street at [[Sevenwells]] area of [[Chennai]], which is in the area near [[Kandaswami Temple, Georgetown|Chennai Kandha kottam Kandha sw\u0101mi temple.]] After R\u0101malingam reached five years of age, Sabhapati initiated his [[formal education]]. But the young child was not interested in that, instead he preferred trips to the nearby Kandha sw\u0101mi temple. Sabhapati thought that the child needed punishment as a form of discipline, and  he told his wife not to  give R\u0101malingam his daily meal. His kind sister-in-law, however, secretly gave him food and persuaded him to study seriously at home. God gave food before sister in law gave food. In return, R\u0101malingam asked  for his own room, lighted lamp and mirror.  He placed the light in front of the mirror. He started [[meditation]] by concentrating on the light and thus began the young boy's spiritual life. He miraculously saw a vision of the [[Murugan|Lord Muruga]]. R\u0101malingam said:\n\n:\"The beauty endowed divine faces six, the illustrious shoulders twelve.\"<ref>Lakshmi Devnath, [http://www.hinduonnet.com/2001/02/02/stories/1302136a.htm \"Compassion is the essence of Saint R\u0101malingam's philosophy\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110107124551/http://www.hinduonnet.com/2001/02/02/stories/1302136a.htm |date=2011-01-07 }}, ''The Hindu'', February 2, 2001</ref>\n\nAt one time, R\u0101malingam had to replace his elder brother Sabhapati at an [[Katha (storytelling format)|upany\u0101sam]] (religious stories) session as up\u0101sakar. His great discourse on verses from the `[[Periya Puranam|Periya pur\u0101nam]]', an epic poem by [[Sekkizhar]] about the saintly '63 [[Nayanars|N\u0101yan\u0101rs]]', was appreciated by the devotees as being given by a very learned scholar. R\u0101malingam's mental and spiritual growth progressed rapidly. R\u0101malingam says thanks to the [[divinity|Divine]] by:\n\n:\"Effulgent flame of grace, that lit in me intelligence, to know untaught.\"<ref>[http://www.Vallalar.org/WebComponents/FrontPage.aspx?ViewName=enBlogs&WebSiteId=1&ConId=294 Early life of Saint Vallal\u0101r]{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nR\u0101malingam evolved in his spiritual journey from being a devout devotee of [[Shiva|Lord Shiva]] to worshipping the formless.\n\nR\u0101malingam renounced the world at the young age of thirteen. But he was forced to marry his niece (on his sister's side). Legends say that the [[bridegroom]] during his first night after marriage was reading devotional works like the [[Tiruvasakam|Thiru v\u0101sagam]]. He was not interested in money, and it is said that in later life he reduced or ignored eating and sleeping. But he seemed fit in body, which was possibly due to his supposed physical transformation.\n\n==Teachings==\n[[File:Sathya gnana sabha, vadalur 2.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Heaps of grain bags at [[Satyagnana Sabha, Vadalur|Sathya gnana sabha, Vadalur]] - established by R\u0101malinga adigal ]]\nAt the age of 35 he left Chennai during the year 1858. First he went to [[Chidambaram]] where he had a debate with Kodakanallur Sundara Sw\u0101migal. At the request of one R\u0101makrishna Reddiyar he went to his house at [[Karunguzhi]] and stayed there for 9 years. He was very much against the [[caste|caste system]] because of the adverse impacts it had on society. Towards that end, he started the \"Samarasa  Vedha Sanmarga Sangam\" in 1865. In 1872 it was renamed \"Samarasa Suddha Sanmarga Sathya Sangam\",<ref name=\"ambalamyoga.org\" /> meaning \"Society for pure truth in universal self-hood\".\n\nIn 1867, he established a  facility serving free food named \"The Sathya Dharma Salai\"<ref>[http://www.Vallalarspace.com/VallalarGroups/ Image of Sathya Dharma Salai]</ref> in [[Vadalur]]. There all people are served free food without any caste distinctions. The land for the facility was donated by kind, generous people and those registered documents are available for seeing by the visitors. The free facility continues its service till the present time. R\u0101malinga disliked people eating [[non-vegetarian]] foods, about which he said:<blockquote>When I see men feeding on the coarse and vicious food of meat, it is an ever-recurring grief to me.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.hinduonnet.com/2001/02/02/stories/1302136a.htm |title=\"The Hindu\" article on Vallal\u0101r |access-date=2008-06-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110107124551/http://www.hinduonnet.com/2001/02/02/stories/1302136a.htm |archive-date=2011-01-07 |url-status=dead }}</ref></blockquote>\n \n[[File:Sathya gnana sabha, vadalur 3.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Entrance to the Sathya Gnana Sabha. The sign above it reads \"only those who have renounced meat and murder should enter\"]]\nOn January 25th of 1872, R\u0101malingam opened the \"[[Satyagnana Sabha, Vadalur|Sathya Gnana Sabha]]\" (Hall of True Knowledge) at [[Vadalur]]. One of the primary teachings of Valallar is \"[[community service|Service]] to [[Human beings|Living Beings]] is the path of [[Moksha|Liberation/ Moksha]]\". He declared that death is not natural that our life's first priority should be to fight death. He declared religion in itself a darkness. He laid a very great emphasis on being vegetarian. He said God is \"Arul Perum Jothi\" who is personification of Grace or mercy and knowledge. He said the path of compassion and mercy are the only path to God.\n\nIn 1867 he established a center for feeding the poor people. On the inaugural day he lit the fire of the stone stove, with a declaration that the fire be ever alive and the needy shall be fed forever. Around 1872 he established the \"Sathya Gnana Sabai\", hall of True Wisdom Forum and ensuring it was entirely secular. This place is not a [[temple]]; fruits, flowers are not offered, and no blessings were given. It was open to people of all castes except those who ate meat, who were only allowed to worship from the outside. He wrote in detail about the ''pooja'' to be performed in Gn\u0101na sabai. Those who are below 12 years or those who are above 72 years alone were expected to enter Gn\u0101na sabai and do ''poojas''. The oil lamp lit by him is kept perpetually burning. He said that [[soul]]s are blinded by seven veils.<ref>[https://www.vallalyaar.com/enquiry-on-truth-satvisaaram-vallalar/] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110409135431/http://www.ambalamyoga.org/On%20Vallalar%20by%20Arul%20file.pdf |date=2011-04-09 }}</ref>\n \nThere are seven cotton fabric screens, representing the seven factors that prevent a soul from realizing its truth.

He said the intelligence we possess is [[Maya (religion)|Maya]] intelligence which is not true and final intelligence. The path of final intelligence is ''Jeeva Karunyam''. Looking other souls with compassion, also own soul from birth and death. He advocated a [[Caste in India|casteless society]]. Vallal\u0101r was opposed to [[superstition]]s and rituals. He forbade killing animals for the sake of food. He advocated feeding the poor as the highest form of worship. He condemned inequality based on birth. Today there are spiritual groups spread out all over the world who practice the teachings of R\u0101malingam and follow the path of Arul Perum Jothi. \n\n== Chennai Kandha Kottam ==\n[[Kandaswami Temple, Georgetown|Kandha kottam Kandasw\u0101mi Temple]]<ref>Official website Kandha kottam temple [http://kandhakottam.tnhrce.in/contact.html kandhakottam.tnhrce.in],  [http://www.kaumaram.com/\u0101layam/kandha_kottam/index.php Chennai Kandha kottam at Kaumaram.com]</ref> is located in the [[George Town, Chennai|Parry's Corner]] neighbourhood of [[Chennai]] city.

R\u0101malingam composed 'Deiva mani malai' here. At this temple, there is a hall called the [[Mandapa|Mukha mandapam]], where the idols of [[Ganesha|Sarva Siddhi Vinayakar]], [[Meenakshi Sundareswarar Temple|Meenakshi Sundareswarar]], Idumban, Sri R\u0101malinga sw\u0101migal,<ref>[http://temple.dinamalar.com/en/New_en.php?id=12 Dinamalar newspaper- Kandha kottam photos]</ref> and Pamban sw\u0101migal are found. The locality where he lived, has been renamed as '[[Vallalar Nagar|Vallal\u0101r nagar]]'.\n\n==Literary works==\nAs a musician and divine poet, he composed 5818 poems teaching universal love and peace, compiled into 'Six Thiru Muraigal', which are all available today as a single book called Thiruvarutpa<ref>[http://www.tn.gov.in/tnpsc/FINEARTSde.html Tamil Nadu Public service commission included Thiru arut pa in syllabus]</ref> (tiru-arut-pa, holy book of grace).\n\nAnother work of his is the Manumurai Kanda V\u0101sagam<ref>[http://vallalar.org/Tamil/V000000076B Manumurai Kanda V\u0101sagam ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110409135431/http://www.ambalamyoga.org/On%20Vallalar%20by%20Arul%20file.pdf |date=2011-04-09 }}</ref> describing the life of [[Manu Needhi Cholan]].\n\nJeeva Karunya Ozhukkam<ref>[http://vallalar.org/english Details on Jeeva Karunya Ozhukkam] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725002210/http://www.ambalamyoga.org/Jeiva%20Karunai.pdf |date=2011-07-25 }}</ref>\n\n===Songs set to music===\n* Thiruvarutpa songs of R\u0101malinga sw\u0101migal are divine sung in concerts and now at least 25 songs (in Thiru varut p\u0101 Isai M\u0101lai) are given with swara-t\u0101la notation.\n* ''Th\u0101y\u0101gi thandhaiyumai'' ([[Hamsadhwani]]), ''Idu nalla tharunam'' ([[Dheerasankarabharanam|Shankar\u0101bharanam]])\n* ''Varuvar azhaithu vadi'' (Begada) and ''Thaen ena inikkum''.\n\nSome of his songs were set to music by [[Sirkazhi Govindarajan|S\u012brk\u0101zhi Govindhar\u0101jan]].<ref>[http://www.hindu.com/fr/2004/11/05/stories/2004110503330900.htm Sirkazhi Govindarajan] from \"The Hindu\" newspaper</ref>\n\n==Supposed physical transformation==\n{{unreferenced section|date=October 2018}}\nPerhaps one of the most notable factors of this sage is the claim that he supposedly attained a divinization of the physical body. He attained a total of 3 transformations (i.e. transformations into Pure Body, Pranava (Sound) Body, and Gnostic Body). His first transformation was the transformation of his normal human body into the Perfect Body. The supposed attributes of this body are total invulnerability to everything thus rendering him effectively immortal and impervious to any kind of damage as well as having the attributes of being omnipotent, omnipresent and omniscient, this body is apparently made of Divine Light.\n\nBeyond this state there was a subsequent transformation by which the Perfect Body transformed further into the Grace Body possessing the following attributes: This body has automatically a young appearance like that of a child, can be seen but can't be touched, and has complete and absolute dominion over all the [[Siddhis]].\n\nEven beyond the State of the Grace Body supposedly there was a third and final transformation in which the Grace Body was transformed into the Bliss Body. This body is the body of the Supreme Godhead and is automatically omnipresent but can't be perceived by anyone.\n\nBy achieving this R\u0101malingam demonstrated that the ultimate states of spirituality can in fact be attained in this world with the physical body and death is not a necessity to experience the ultimate spiritual experience.\n\n==Disappearance==\nOn October 22, 1873, R\u0101malingam raised the ''flag of Brotherhood''{{what|date=October 2018}} on his one-room residence ''Siddhi Val\u0101gam'' in Mettukuppam.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.hinduonnet.com/2001/02/02/stories/1302136a.htm |title=Article in \"The Hindu\" narration on Siddhi Valakam |access-date=2008-06-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110107124551/http://www.hinduonnet.com/2001/02/02/stories/1302136a.htm |archive-date=2011-01-07 |url-status=dead }}</ref> He gave his final and most popular lecture, about spiritual progress and, \"nature of the powers that lie beyond us and move us,\" and recommended meditation using the lighted lamp from his room, which he then kept outside.\n\nOn January 30, 1874, R\u0101malingam entered the room, locked himself inside and told his followers not to open it. After opening, he said, he will not be found there. (He will be \"United with Nature & ruling the actions of 'all of the alls',\" as told in his poem called 'Gnana Sariyai'). His seclusion spurred many rumors, and the Government finally forced the doors open in May. The room was empty, with no clues. In 1906, records about his disappearance<ref>[http://bp3.blogger.com/_ye_-S-DaxNE/R_RyHb_UkJI/AAAAAAAAAqs/98zB2rqpjDI/s1600-h/gazette+1.jpg The image of engraved stone in Vadalur] about the Madras District Gazette's note describing the R\u0101malingam's disappearance incident, that took place on January 30, 1874</ref> were published in the South Arcot District's 'The Madras District [[Gazette]]er'.\n\n==Postage stamp==\nThe Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu released postage stamps depicting R\u0101malingam on 17 August 2007.

Due to frequent invasions by the Shandu and subsequent colonization by the British, the Ahraing Khami (Khumi) left their homeland. They emigrated to the hilly regions of the Kaladan River headwaters, and to the Pi Chaung and the Mi Chaung streams in the Arakan Hill Tracts where another group of Khami (Khumi), the Mro (Mru) and Ahraing Khami (Khumi), lived.

However, the Mro (Mru) and  ( Awa Khamis) are the oldest tribes living in the region. Together, they form the largest percentage of the population of the approximately 230 square miles Saingdin region.<ref name=\"Beniison 1933 204\" />\nThe two main streams that flow through Saingdin are Re Chaung in the east and Sit Chaung in the west. Both streams originate from the northern part of the region which forms the boundary between Buthidaung Township and the Arakan Hill Tracts. The two streams meander between cliffs for 30 miles before they finally join together near Tharaungchaung village. The two streams flood during the [[monsoon]] season and normally subside after the rains. Water transportation is difficult due to large rocks obstructing the streams. Canoes and bamboo rafts are the only means of transportation to the interior area of the region.<ref name=\"Beniison 1933 204\" />\nOn the sloping banks of the two streams, the Mro(Mru) grow tobacco in the alluvial deposits after clearing naturally grown ''kaing'' grass. They also grow paddy, cotton, cane, and bamboo to sell in a weekly bazaar near the waterfall.<ref name=\"Beniison 1933 204\" />\n\n== Demographics ==\nAs of 1931, the Saingdin area consists of 90 hamlets and each hamlet contains between two and twenty bamboo houses.<ref name=\"Beniison 1933 204\"/> The population, according to the 1931 Census is 3,390, of which 1,779 are males.<ref name=\"Beniison 1933 204\"/>\nCurrently, about 70,000 Mro (Mru) live on the border of Burma with India and Bangladesh. The majority of Mro (Mru) people, approximately 12,000, live in Burma within the Yoma District and the Arakan Hill Tracts of western Burma. These figures are, however, just rough estimates as the last census was conducted in 1931 when the country was under the colonial rule. At that time, the total number of Mro (Mru) people was estimated around 13,766. Around 200 more villages making up of between 20,000 and 25,000 people are located in the Chittaung Hills of southern Bangladesh. Another 2,000 Mrus inhabit the districts of West Bengal, India.

Around March, they burn the trees that are taken down for taungya paddy cultivation and they start sowing in April. When they sow the seeds separately in pits, they use spades, which are made with a long handle from an old taungya-cutting-dah (knife) that is no longer usable.<ref>{{cite book|last=Beniison|first=J.J|title=Census of India, 1931: Burma Part I \u2013 Report|date=1933|publisher=Office of Superintendent, Government Printing and Stationery, Burma|location=Rangoon|page=251}}</ref>\n\n== Traditional rites and rituals ==\n\n=== Birth ===\nAfter the birth of a child, four short bamboos are placed on the bank of the stream.

One of the goats is put in front of the hut closest to the stream and the other near the second hut. The fowls are then placed in between the two huts. After the villagers pray for good health and the abundance of crops for the coming taungya cultivation, both the goats and fowls are slaughtered one after another starting from the goat nearest to the stream. The blood of the animals is then sprayed over the small huts and the flowing water. The villagers then cooked the goats and the fowls are reclaimed by their respective owners. With the meat and ''khaung'', they made an offering to the nat before they begin the feast. Meanwhile, the village is shut down for three days and the villagers fix up bamboo arches over the village path. If anyone enters the village during this time period, a compensation has to be paid to cover all the expenses incurred. This ceremony is celebrated once a year and after the ceremony, they can start their ''taungya'' cultivation for the year.<ref name=\"Beniison 1933 253\">{{cite book|last=Beniison|first=J.J|title=Census of India, 1931: Burma Part I \u2013 Report|date=1933|publisher=Office of Superintendent, Government Printing and Stationery, Burma|location=Rangoon|page=253}}</ref>\n\n=== Beginning of Taungya Harvest ===\nAfter the ''taungya'' fruits and vegetables are ready for the harvest, household members go into their ''taungyas'' and collect several different vegetables and fruits with a few plants of paddy. The vegetables and fruits are then put into a big basket and paddy into ''khaung'' pot. A fowl is then killed and its blood sprinkled over the ''khaung'' pot and the vegetable basket. Another fowl is cooked using rice flour and mixing it with salt and ginger. Then the rice is mixed with the ''khaung'' and then together with the fowl, they made an offering in various different baskets to the ''nats'' who live in the staircase of the house. Neighbors are then invited to enjoy the rest of the meat. This ''natpwe'' is held on the same day by different households in a village. Villagers can harvest their produce after the ceremony.<ref name=\"Beniison 1933 253\"/>\n\n=== End of Taungya Harvest ===\nAfter all the crops have been harvested, every household kills a pig or two and cooks some pieces of pork in a bamboo tube. The household members then take the meat along with rice and ''khaung'' to their ''taungya''. Once they arrived at their ''taungya'', offerings are made to various nats roaming near the streams close to the ''taungya''. They then pray to the nats for their physical well-being. After they return home, they threw a feast with the rest of the pork and ''khaung''. This ''pwe'' is also celebrated on the same day by all the villagers.<ref name=\"Beniison 1933 253\"/>\n\n=== Funeral ===\nUpon the death of a Mro individual, their body is put in a coffin made of split colored bamboos and in some cases rugs and blankets. The body is then cremated and the remaining unburnt pieces of bones are collected; after being stored in the village for 2\u20133 months they are stored in a small hut constructed above the location at which the body was cremated.\n\nIn the case of death by contagious disease (especially small-pox and cholera) the deceased individual is buried immediately and no hut is constructed<ref>{{cite book|title=Census of India, 1931: Burma Part I \u2013 Report|last=Beniison|first=J.J|date=1933|publisher=Office of Superintendent, Government Printing and Stationery, Burma|location=Rangoon|page=250}}</ref>\n\n== Marriage law ==\nA man usually discusses with his father about the woman he intends to marry. The father along with his son and a few other villagers visits the house of the prospective bride. They bring three birds, a spear and a ''dah'' (dagger) with them and the spear and the ''dah'' are given to the bride's parents as presents and the fowls for the family to eat. In return, the bride's family cooks pork for the visitors. The visitors must not eat the fowls and the hosts the pork. The bride's father then consults with her daughter and after getting her consent, asks for a dowry. In 1931, it usually consisted of around Rs. 100 and the groom's father may not bargain. After the dowry is settled, the groom's party stays for three days, feasting on ''khaung'' and leaves the next day.<ref>{{cite book|last=Beniison|first=J.J|title=Census of India, 1931: Burma Part I \u2013 Report|date=1933|publisher=Office of Superintendent, Government Printing and Stationery, Burma|location=Rangoon|page=255}}</ref>\nHowever, in case of a marriage, contracted between the couple without the parental consent, for instance, in a case in which a man elopes with a woman to his parent's house, the parents, with the village elders, return the bride to her parents along with three fowls and ''khaung''. The groom's parents then ask what dowry the bride's parents would like to accept. The dowry, in this case, can be as high as Rs. 100 or as low as Rs. 30. Similar procedures as the one mentioned above take place, except that the groom's family does not stay over for a night but return home with the couple. Then the marriage date is chosen. The bride visits her home occasionally but never returns to live there permanently. If either party breaks the promise of marriage, no action is taken as long as either the bride or the groom claims that one does not love the other. If the bride breaks the promise, half of the dowry has to be returned whereas if the groom breaks the promise, his family loses the dowry. If the husband dies, the heir is entitled to nothing; she has to abandon the issue of marriage, if any, with her father-in-law or a brother-in-law.<ref>{{cite book|last=Beniison|first=J.J|title=Census of India, 1931: Burma Part I \u2013 Report|date=1933|publisher=Office of Superintendent, Government Printing and Stationery, Burma|location=Rangoon|page=208}}</ref>\n\n== Dress ==\n[[File:Mro women working in Bangladesh.jpg|thumb|Mru women working in a village in Bangladesh.

At least one cow or more are sacrificed in devotion to the sacred spirit with the intention of being free from ill or any curse that has been suffered. A full night of dancing and playing ploong takes place and continues onto the next day. After full night of dancing, early in the morning, the cow is killed by a spear. Then its tongue is cut off. The villagers then move to sit on the body of the cow putting a turban on head. Rice beer or alcohol is served during the feast. After cooking the meat and most of the cow all villagers come together and enjoy the feast. There is no fixed time for the ceremony as anybody who affords it can organize it anytime. Guests are allowed to take part. On 28 December 2017, I happened to take the ceremony in Sakoi Commander para (village) of Thanchi with 4 other friends. While attending, I asked an elder Mru in the venue why this cow killing ceremony? He told me a legendary as follows: <nowiki>''</nowiki>Long time ago, almighty summoned Mru people to take their letters. In that time all the people were so busy with work. For bringing the letters, they send a cow. Cow according to their order went, received and then set to move back. On the halfway, the cow felt so hungry and took rest under a fig tree. During then, unconsciously the letter plate was swallowed down into her stomach. On return, the Mru people came to know the story of losing the letters and fired on the cow. The chief of the Mru first hit the mouth, thus all the upper teeth of the cow were broken. While the almighty spirit cross-checked, they complain about the swallowing incident and the spirit asked them to punish the cow by act anything they want to. And that was proclaimed as No Sin.

Due to frequent invasions by the Shandu and subsequent colonization by the British, the Ahraing Khami (Khumi) left their homeland. They emigrated to the hilly regions of the Kaladan River headwaters, and to the Pi Chaung and the Mi Chaung streams in the Arakan Hill Tracts where another group of Khami (Khumi), the Mru (Mrucha) and Ahraing Khami (Khumi), lived.

However, the Mru (Mrucha) and Mru ( Awa Khamis) are the oldest tribes living in the region. Together, they form the largest percentage of the population of the approximately 230 square miles Saingdin region.<ref name=\"Beniison 1933 204\" />\nThe two main streams that flow through Saingdin are Re Chaung in the east and Sit Chaung in the west. Both streams originate from the northern part of the region which forms the boundary between Buthidaung Township and the Arakan Hill Tracts. The two streams meander between cliffs for 30 miles before they finally join together near Tharaungchaung village. The two streams flood during the [[monsoon]] season and normally subside after the rains. Water transportation is difficult due to large rocks obstructing the streams. Canoes and bamboo rafts are the only means of transportation to the interior area of the region.<ref name=\"Beniison 1933 204\" />\nOn the sloping banks of the two streams, the Mru (Mrucha) grow tobacco in the alluvial deposits after clearing naturally grown ''kaing'' grass. They also grow paddy, cotton, cane, and bamboo to sell in a weekly bazaar near the waterfall.<ref name=\"Beniison 1933 204\" />\n\n== Demographics ==\nAs of 1931, the Saingdin area consists of 90 hamlets and each hamlet contains between two and twenty bamboo houses.<ref name=\"Beniison 1933 204\"/> The population, according to the 1931 Census is 3,390, of which 1,779 are males.<ref name=\"Beniison 1933 204\"/>\nCurrently, about 70,000 Mru (Mrucha) live on the border of Burma with India and Bangladesh. The majority of Mru (Mrucha) people, approximately 12,000, live in Burma within the Yoma District and the Arakan Hill Tracts of western Burma. These figures are, however, just rough estimates as the last census was conducted in 1931 when the country was under the colonial rule. At that time, the total number of Mru (Mrucha) people was estimated around 13,766. Around 200 more villages making up of between 20,000 and 25,000 people are located in the Chittaung Hills of southern Bangladesh. Another 2,000 Mrus inhabit the districts of West Bengal, India.

Around March, they burn the trees that are taken down for taungya paddy cultivation and they start sowing in April. When they sow the seeds separately in pits, they use spades, which are made with a long handle from an old taungya-cutting-dah (knife) that is no longer usable.<ref>{{cite book|last=Beniison|first=J.J|title=Census of India, 1931: Burma Part I \u2013 Report|date=1933|publisher=Office of Superintendent, Government Printing and Stationery, Burma|location=Rangoon|page=251}}</ref>\n\n== Traditional rites and rituals ==\n\n=== Birth ===\nAfter the birth of a child, four short bamboos are placed on the bank of the stream.

One of the goats is put in front of the hut closest to the stream and the other near the second hut. The fowls are then placed in between the two huts. After the villagers pray for good health and the abundance of crops for the coming taungya cultivation, both the goats and fowls are slaughtered one after another starting from the goat nearest to the stream. The blood of the animals is then sprayed over the small huts and the flowing water. The villagers then cooked the goats and the fowls are reclaimed by their respective owners. With the meat and ''khaung'', they made an offering to the nat before they begin the feast. Meanwhile, the village is shut down for three days and the villagers fix up bamboo arches over the village path. If anyone enters the village during this time period, a compensation has to be paid to cover all the expenses incurred. This ceremony is celebrated once a year and after the ceremony, they can start their ''taungya'' cultivation for the year.<ref name=\"Beniison 1933 253\">{{cite book|last=Beniison|first=J.J|title=Census of India, 1931: Burma Part I \u2013 Report|date=1933|publisher=Office of Superintendent, Government Printing and Stationery, Burma|location=Rangoon|page=253}}</ref>\n\n=== Beginning of Taungya Harvest ===\nAfter the ''taungya'' fruits and vegetables are ready for the harvest, household members go into their ''taungyas'' and collect several different vegetables and fruits with a few plants of paddy. The vegetables and fruits are then put into a big basket and paddy into ''khaung'' pot. A fowl is then killed and its blood sprinkled over the ''khaung'' pot and the vegetable basket. Another fowl is cooked using rice flour and mixing it with salt and ginger. Then the rice is mixed with the ''khaung'' and then together with the fowl, they made an offering in various different baskets to the ''nats'' who live in the staircase of the house. Neighbors are then invited to enjoy the rest of the meat. This ''natpwe'' is held on the same day by different households in a village. Villagers can harvest their produce after the ceremony.<ref name=\"Beniison 1933 253\"/>\n\n=== End of Taungya Harvest ===\nAfter all the crops have been harvested, every household kills a pig or two and cooks some pieces of pork in a bamboo tube. The household members then take the meat along with rice and ''khaung'' to their ''taungya''. Once they arrived at their ''taungya'', offerings are made to various nats roaming near the streams close to the ''taungya''. They then pray to the nats for their physical well-being. After they return home, they threw a feast with the rest of the pork and ''khaung''. This ''pwe'' is also celebrated on the same day by all the villagers.<ref name=\"Beniison 1933 253\"/>\n\n=== Funeral ===\nUpon the death of a Mru individual, their body is put in a coffin made of split colored bamboos and in some cases rugs and blankets. The body is then cremated and the remaining unburnt pieces of bones are collected; after being stored in the village for 2\u20133 months they are stored in a small hut constructed above the location at which the body was cremated.\n\nIn the case of death by contagious disease (especially small-pox and cholera) the deceased individual is buried immediately and no hut is constructed<ref>{{cite book|title=Census of India, 1931: Burma Part I \u2013 Report|last=Beniison|first=J.J|date=1933|publisher=Office of Superintendent, Government Printing and Stationery, Burma|location=Rangoon|page=250}}</ref>\n\n== Marriage law ==\nA man usually discusses with his father about the woman he intends to marry. The father along with his son and a few other villagers visits the house of the prospective bride. They bring three birds, a spear and a ''dah'' (dagger) with them and the spear and the ''dah'' are given to the bride's parents as presents and the fowls for the family to eat. In return, the bride's family cooks pork for the visitors. The visitors must not eat the fowls and the hosts the pork. The bride's father then consults with her daughter and after getting her consent, asks for a dowry. In 1931, it usually consisted of around Rs. 100 and the groom's father may not bargain. After the dowry is settled, the groom's party stays for three days, feasting on ''khaung'' and leaves the next day.<ref>{{cite book|last=Beniison|first=J.J|title=Census of India, 1931: Burma Part I \u2013 Report|date=1933|publisher=Office of Superintendent, Government Printing and Stationery, Burma|location=Rangoon|page=255}}</ref>\nHowever, in case of a marriage, contracted between the couple without the parental consent, for instance, in a case in which a man elopes with a woman to his parent's house, the parents, with the village elders, return the bride to her parents along with three fowls and ''khaung''. The groom's parents then ask what dowry the bride's parents would like to accept. The dowry, in this case, can be as high as Rs. 100 or as low as Rs. 30. Similar procedures as the one mentioned above take place, except that the groom's family does not stay over for a night but return home with the couple. Then the marriage date is chosen. The bride visits her home occasionally but never returns to live there permanently. If either party breaks the promise of marriage, no action is taken as long as either the bride or the groom claims that one does not love the other. If the bride breaks the promise, half of the dowry has to be returned whereas if the groom breaks the promise, his family loses the dowry. If the husband dies, the heir is entitled to nothing; she has to abandon the issue of marriage, if any, with her father-in-law or a brother-in-law.<ref>{{cite book|last=Beniison|first=J.J|title=Census of India, 1931: Burma Part I \u2013 Report|date=1933|publisher=Office of Superintendent, Government Printing and Stationery, Burma|location=Rangoon|page=208}}</ref>\n\n== Dress ==\n[[File:Mru women working in Bangladesh.jpg|thumb|Mru women working in a village in Bangladesh.

At least one cow or more are sacrificed in devotion to the sacred spirit with the intention of being free from ill or any curse that has been suffered. A full night of dancing and playing ploong takes place and continues onto the next day. After full night of dancing, early in the morning, the cow is killed by a spear. Then its tongue is cut off. The villagers then move to sit on the body of the cow putting a turban on head. Rice beer or alcohol is served during the feast. After cooking the meat and most of the cow all villagers come together and enjoy the feast. There is no fixed time for the ceremony as anybody who affords it can organize it anytime. Guests are allowed to take part. On 28 December 2017, I happened to take the ceremony in Sakoi Commander para (village) of Thanchi with 4 other friends. While attending, I asked an elder Mru in the venue why this cow killing ceremony? He told me a legendary as follows: <nowiki>''</nowiki>Long time ago, almighty summoned Mru people to take their letters. In that time all the people were so busy with work. For bringing the letters, they send a cow. Cow according to their order went, received and then set to move back. On the halfway, the cow felt so hungry and took rest under a fig tree. During then, unconsciously the letter plate was swallowed down into her stomach. On return, the Mru people came to know the story of losing the letters and fired on the cow. The chief of the Mru first hit the mouth, thus all the upper teeth of the cow were broken.

The GHRC uses innovative approaches to research and solve important health and health policy challenges in China and around the world. The GHRC is built on the principles of scientific excellence and focuses on establishing interdisciplinary, mutually-beneficial collaborations with researchers from China. It will host national and international conferences to disseminate research findings and encourage dialogue among scientists, professionals, policy-makers and other key stakeholders engaged in global health.\n\nThe GHRC focuses on four research areas: emerging infectious diseases, environmental health, health policy and systems, and non-communicable chronic diseases. Between 2013-2018, researchers at the GHRC have published over 160 peer-reviewed papers in a variety of journals including the Lancet, Lancet Global Health, JAMA, JAMA Internal Medicine, Circulation, PLOS Medicine, American Journal of Public Health, and American Journal of Epidemiology.\n\nThe faculty and research activities complement the global health education programs offered at Duke Kunshan University, including the Master of Science in Global Health and the undergraduate semester courses in global health.\n\nThe Environmental Research Center draws knowledge from an array of fields together to tackle the most pressing environmental challenges in China, Asia and the world. Experts and scholars cooperate and inspire each other over the discussion and research on topics such as energy, climate change, water, ecosystem conservation, environment and public health. The center has become a platform where policy problems come for solutions and where knowledge and talents serve the society.\n\n== Conferences ==\n*'''International Meteorite Conference, Meteorite China''' - Duke Kunshan University hosted China's first-ever international meteorite conference on 15 September 2017.
