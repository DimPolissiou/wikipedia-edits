The club has since competed in each of the lower three tiers of the Football League, in addition to one season spent in the [[Conference Premier]] in [[2003\u201304 Football Conference|2003\u201304]]. It has also competed in the [[Welsh Cup]], winning it six times.\n\nBetween 1910 and 2007, the club was based at [[Gay Meadow]] on the banks of the [[River Severn]]; since 2007, the club have played at the [[New Meadow]], a [[UEFA stadium categories#Category four|UEFA Category one stadium]]{{citation needed|date=June 2019}} with a capacity of 9,875.\n\n==History==\n{{main|History of Shrewsbury Town F.C.}}\n\n===Early history===\n{{See also|List of Shrewsbury Town F.C. seasons}}\n[[File:The Lion Hotel Shrewsbury - geograph.org.uk - 1745301.jpg|thumb|Some reports indicate the club being founded at The Lion Hotel]]\nShrewsbury Town were formed in 1886, following the demise of first [[Shropshire Wanderers F.C.|Shropshire Wanderers]] and later indirectly [[Shrewsbury Castle Blues F.C.|Castle Blues]]. The Blues were a rough team, leading to their demise after several games were marred by violence. The new team hoped to be as successful but without the notoriety. Press reports differ as to the date the new club was formed, The ''Eddowes Shropshire Journal'' of 26 May 1886 reported the birth of the club at The Lion Hotel, Wyle Cop, [[Shrewsbury]]. The ''[[Shrewsbury Chronicle]]'' reported the club's being formed at the Turf Hotel, Claremont Hill, Shrewsbury. It may be both accounts are true, with a get-together at The Lion being finalised at the Turf.\n\nAfter friendlies and regional cup competitions for the first few seasons, Shrewsbury were founder members of the Shropshire & District League in [[1890\u201391 in English football|1890\u201391]], later admitted to the [[West Midlands (Regional) League|Birmingham & District League]] in [[1895\u201396 in English football|1895\u201396]]. Many of the teams Town faced in the early days have vanished, however Shrewsbury met many of today's Football League and Conference teams, including [[Crewe Alexandra F.C.|Crewe Alexandra]], [[Coventry City F.C.|Coventry City]], [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]], [[Kidderminster Harriers F.C.|Kidderminster Harriers]] and [[Stafford Rangers F.C.|Stafford Rangers]].\n\nIn 1910, Shrewsbury looked to move to a new ground, having spent early years at locations across the town, notably at [[Copthorne Barracks]] west of the town. The club moved to [[Gay Meadow]] on the edge of the town centre, within sight of [[Shrewsbury Abbey]], and stayed 97 years.<ref>{{cite news |title=Shrewsbury Town History |url=http://www.shrewsburytown.com/page/History/0,,10443,00.html |publisher=Shrewsbury Town |date=11 Jul 2007 |accessdate=11 January 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120223182510/http://www.shrewsburytown.com/page/History/0,,10443,00.html |archivedate=23 February 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nShrewsbury's Birmingham League days were mostly mid-table, with a few seasons challenging near the top, the club being league champions in [[1922\u201323 in English football|1922\u201323]].\n\nA move to the Midland Champions League in [[1937\u201338 in English football|1937\u201338]] saw the club enjoy one of its most successful seasons, winning a league and cup treble. Shrewsbury were league champions, scoring 111 goals . In addition, the [[Welsh Cup]] was won following a replay, the team enjoyed a run in the [[FA Cup]], and won the [[Shropshire Senior Cup]].\n\nAfter a run of good seasons in post-war years, Shrewsbury were admitted, alongside [[Scunthorpe United]] to the old Division 3 (North) of the Football League in 1950, after being Midland League champions in [[1949\u201350 in English football|1949\u201350]], following the decision to expand from 88 to 92 clubs.\n\n===Football League history===\n[[File:Shrewsbury Town FC League Performance.svg|225px|thumb|Chart of yearly table positions of The Shrews in the Football League.]]\n\nShrewsbury gained their first promotion, to the [[Football League Third Division|Third Division]], in [[1958\u201359 in English football|1958\u201359]]. They remained in the third tier 15 years, slipping back to Division Four at the end of [[1973\u201374 in English football|1973\u201374]].\n\n1960\u201361 season saw Shrewsbury Town reach the Semi Final of the [[League Cup]]. After beating [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] in the quarter-finals, they narrowly lost over two legs 4\u20133 on aggregate to [[Rotherham United]]. This era was also remembered for [[Arthur Rowley]]. He arrived from [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]] in 1958, the club's first player/manager. During his playing and managerial career, he broke [[Dixie Dean]]'s goal-scoring record, scoring his 380th league goal against [[Bradford City A.F.C.|Bradford City]] at [[Valley Parade]] on 29 April 1961. Retiring from playing in 1965 he remained manager until July 1968.\n\nShrewsbury were promoted to the Third Division in [[1974\u201375 in English football|1974\u201375]] as runners-up, before another successful season in [[1978\u201379 in English football|1978\u201379]], when they were league champions under [[Richie Barker (footballer, born 1939)|Ritchie Barker]] and later [[Graham Turner]].  Over 14,000 fans packed [[Gay Meadow]] on 17 May 1979 to see Shrewsbury seal promotion with a 4\u20131 win over [[Exeter City F.C.|Exeter City]]. In addition, the club had their first run to the FA Cup quarter-finals, before a replay defeat to [[Wolverhampton Wanderers]]. Turner is the team's most successful manager, winning the Third Division Championship in 1978\u201379 \u2013 his first season in charge \u2013 to take the club into the [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]] for the first time.<ref name=\"guardian\" /> They remained for ten years, although Turner departed for [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] in 1984.<ref name=\"steps\" /> Shrewsbury repeated their 1979 feat of reaching the quarter-final in [[1981\u201382 in English football|1981\u201382]], defeating [[UEFA Cup]] holders [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]] in the fifth round before defeat away to [[Leicester City]].\n\nThe 1980s saw many big teams defeated by Shrewsbury, whose period in the old Second Division coincided with some of the current [[Premier League]] clubs. During the 1980s, [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]], [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]], [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]], [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] and [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] lost to Shrewsbury Town. [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]] were defeated at Gay Meadow at the end of [[1985\u201386 in English football|1985\u201386]], Shrewsbury winning 2\u20131, relegating Middlesbrough, who went out of business and almost out of existence.  The match was marred by violence from Middlesbrough fans, with many of them later having to return to Shrewsbury for court appearances.\n\nIn the early to mid-1980s the club enjoyed its most successful Football League run. Shrewsbury survived through the sale of players, with some to have played for Shrewsbury including [[Steve Ogrizovic]], [[David Moyes]], [[John McGinlay]] and [[Bernard McNally]]. They were relegated at the end of 1988\u201389 after ten years. In the Third Division, on 22 December 1990, [[Gary Shaw]] scored the quickest Town hat trick \u2013 4&nbsp;minutes and 32&nbsp;seconds \u2013 against [[Bradford City]] at [[Valley Parade]].  At the end of [[1991\u201392 in English football|1991\u201392]], three years after relegation to the Third Division, the club was relegated to the Fourth \u2013 the first time since 1975.\nHowever, two seasons later Shrewsbury won the new ''(fourth tier)'' Division Three championship under Fred Davies in [[1993\u201394 in English football|1993\u201394]], and remained in Division Two ''(third tier)'' three seasons. Shrewsbury were not to rise any further, remaining mid-table before slipping down again at the end of [[1996\u201397 in English football|1996\u201397]].\n\nThe 1990s saw Shrewsbury make their first appearance at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley]] as finalists in the 1996 [[Football League Trophy]] final. Shrewsbury lost 2\u20131 to [[Rotherham United F.C.|Rotherham United]]; future Shrewsbury striker [[Nigel Jemson]] scoring both Rotherham goals. Davies was sacked at the end of the 1996\u201397 relegation season. [[Jake King]] arrived, following a successful reign at local rivals [[Telford United F.C.|Telford United]].\n\n===Kevin Ratcliffe era and Conference===\n[[File:Shrewsbury Town Loggerheads Crest.png|200px|thumb|Loggerheads emblem used by the club between 1993 and 2007]]\nIn the 1999\u20132000, Shrewsbury endured a poor season, with King being sacked in November as the club near relegation. Former [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] captain and Welsh international [[Kevin Ratcliffe]] was appointed manager and saved them from relegation to the [[Football Conference|Conference]] on the final day of the season with a 2\u20131 victory away to [[Exeter City F.C.|Exeter City]].\n\nRatcliffe worked on improving the side. Former youth team and reserve player [[Luke Rodgers]] emerged as a regular goal-scorer, and with big names arriving at Shrewsbury, the team looked on the up, narrowly missing the [[2001\u201302 in English football|2001\u201302]] league playoffs despite 70 points.\n\nThe 2002\u201303 saw Shrewsbury enjoy an FA Cup run. After dispatching non-league sides [[Stafford Rangers F.C.|Stafford Rangers]] and [[Barrow A.F.C.|Barrow]], they won at home against [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] in the third round in front of 7,800, with two goals by Nigel Jemson.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Porter|first1=Steve|title=Shrewsbury Town 2\u20131 Everton|url=http://www.thegiantkillers.co.uk/2003shrewsbury.htm|website=www.thegiantkillers.co.uk|accessdate=5 May 2016}}</ref> [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] were the fourth round visitors, in a televised match on BBC's ''[[Match of the Day]]''. Town lost 0\u20134, with [[Gianfranco Zola]] the man of the match. A near capacity crowd of 7,950 turned up for Chelsea, but from then on, the side's form disappeared, picking up just two wins in the league thereafter. Seven points adrift at the bottom and having conceded 92 goals, the club contemplated the end of their 53 years in the league. Following angry demonstrations from fans, Ratcliffe resigned, and [[Mark Atkins (footballer)|Mark Atkins]] took temporary charge for the club final League game, a 2\u20131 defeat to [[Scunthorpe United F.C.|Scunthorpe United]], who were coincidentally the first League opponents for Shrewsbury Town back in 1950.\n\n[[Northwich Victoria]] manager [[Jimmy Quinn (Northern Ireland footballer)|Jimmy Quinn]] was appointed Shrewsbury manager in May 2003, with the aim of getting them promoted back to the Football League at the first attempt. With most of the previous year's players released, Quinn assembled a whole new squad, with experienced non-league players such as [[Darren Tinson]] and [[Jake Sedgemore]] being joined by [[Colin Cramb]], [[Scott Howie]] and former League Cup finalist [[Martin O'Connor (footballer)|Martin O'Connor]]. The league title went to [[Chester City F.C.|Chester City]], but with 74 points, Shrewsbury finished third in the league and defeated [[Barnet F.C.|Barnet]] in the playoff semi-finals to set up a playoff final against [[Aldershot Town F.C.|Aldershot Town]], at the neutral venue of the [[Britannia Stadium]], home of [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]]. The two teams [[Conference National Playoff Final 2004|played out a 1\u20131 draw]] which went to a [[penalty shoot-out (association football)|penalty shootout]]. Shrewsbury goalkeeper [[Scott Howie]]  saved three consecutive Aldershot penalties and defender [[Trevor Challis]] scored the winning penalty.\n\n===Return to Football League===\n[[File:STFC - New Meadow (Aerial).jpg|thumb|[[New Meadow]]]]\nQuinn departed 14 league games into the season,<ref>{{cite news|title=Quinn quits as Shrewsbury manager|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/s/shrewsbury/3944415.stm|accessdate=15 May 2015|work=BBC Sport|date=22 October 2004}}</ref> being replaced by former Preston manager [[Gary Peters (footballer)|Gary Peters]], who preserved Shrewsbury's Football League status in the [[2004\u201305 Football League Two|2004\u201305 League Two campaign]].

However, blue has not always been the most dominant colour. Early kits included blue and white stripes, quartered shirts and all-blue shirts, which were worn with either white or amber trim until 1978. In 1978 Shrewsbury's most famous kit was introduced \u2013 the blue and amber stripes, which they wore as they were promoted in successive seasons, up to the old second division (now the Football League Championship). This was the design worn by character Derek Smalls in the movie ''[[This Is Spinal Tap]]''.\n\nThe club was not loyal to the stripes for long, and in 1982 reverted to a blue shirt, then used a blue body with amber sleeves, later reverting to an amber body with blue sleeves. In 1987 the shirts radically changed to white shirts for four seasons before reverting to stripes in 1991\u201392. After a flamboyant abstract pattern on the shirts in 1992\u201393, Shrewsbury's kits have stayed mostly blue, with amber stripe(s) of some description evident since 1999.\n\nThe shirt sponsors have, since their introduction in 1982 until 2017, all been local companies. As of the [[2017\u201318 Shrewsbury Town F.C. season|2017\u201318 season]], the current shirt sponsor is The Energy Check, a [[South Shields]]-based Energy management company.\n\n==Club crest==\n\nThe first crest to appear on the shirt of Shrewsbury Town was the town's coat of arms, [[Shrewsbury#Coat of arms|The Loggerheads]] in 1907. The crest was used intermittently on shirts until 1960 through to 1970, when a generic football design was used. During this time, The Loggerheads continued to be used on other merchandise, such as match-day programmes. The Loggerheads returned in 1970, and in various guises continued to be used until 1986, when a \"Shrew\" cartoon was introduced as the club's crest in an attempt to rebrand \"Salop\" as \"The Shrews\".<ref name=\"historicalkits.co.uk\">{{cite web|url=http://www.historicalkits.co.uk/Shrewsbury_Town/Shrewsbury_Town.htm|title=Shrewsbury Town \u2013 Historical Football Kits|website=www.historicalkits.co.uk}}</ref> During this time, the club's kit was also changed to predominantly white. A campaign by fanzine a \"A Large Scotch\" eventually led to the return of The Loggerheads crest in 1992.<ref name=\"historicalkits.co.uk\" /> The crest changed once in again in 2007 to coincide with Salop's move to [[New Meadow]], the new badge featured a single lion's head in a circle. The club stated that the new badge was necessary as any design incorporating The Loggerheads could not be copyrighted.\n\n{| style=\"margin:0 auto;\"\n| [[File:Shrewsbury Town Loggerheads Crest.png|thumb|upright|1993\u20132007]]\n| [[File:Shrewsbury Town badge 2007-2015.png|thumb|upright|2007\u20132015]]\n| [[File:Shrewsbury Town F.C.

In 2019, a group named ''South Stand Flags'' was set up after the opening of [[New Meadow]]'s safe standing section in order to \"improve atmosphere at home games\". The group, usually based in block 8 of the South Stand, organise choreography and flag displays. Their first fundraiser raised over \u00a31000 which funded the purchase of 50 new flags. The group has gained a lot of praise from players and managers, including current Shrewsbury boss [[Sam Ricketts]].<ref>{{cite web |title=About Us |url=https://southstandflags.com/about-us/ |work=South Stand Flags |accessdate=23 February 2020}}</ref>\n\nAn unofficial fanzine and forum named ''Blue & Amber'' was introduced in 2005.<ref>{{cite web |title=Blue and Amber forum |url=https://blueandamber.proboards.com/board/31 |work=Blue & Amber on ProBoards |accessdate=23 February 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn late 2019 the club started attracting fans from the small Caribbean island nation of [[Grenada]].

The club has since competed in each of the lower three tiers of the Football League, in addition to one season spent in the [[Conference Premier]] in [[2003\u201304 Football Conference|2003\u201304]]. It has also competed in the [[Welsh Cup]], winning it six times.\n\nBetween 1910 and 2007, the club was based at [[Gay Meadow]] on the banks of the [[River Severn]]; since 2007, the club have played at the [[New Meadow]], a [[UEFA stadium categories#Category four|UEFA Category one stadium]]{{citation needed|date=June 2019}} with a capacity of 9,875.\n\n==History==\n{{main|History of Shrewsbury Town F.C.}}\n\n===Early history===\n{{See also|List of Shrewsbury Town F.C. seasons}}\n[[File:The Lion Hotel Shrewsbury - geograph.org.uk - 1745301.jpg|thumb|Some reports indicate the club being founded at The Lion Hotel]]\nShrewsbury Town were formed in 1886, following the demise of first [[Shropshire Wanderers F.C.|Shropshire Wanderers]] and later indirectly [[Shrewsbury Castle Blues F.C.|Castle Blues]]. The Blues were a rough team, leading to their demise after several games were marred by violence. The new team hoped to be as successful but without the notoriety. Press reports differ as to the date the new club was formed, The ''Eddowes Shropshire Journal'' of 26 May 1886 reported the birth of the club at The Lion Hotel, Wyle Cop, [[Shrewsbury]]. The ''[[Shrewsbury Chronicle]]'' reported the club's being formed at the Turf Hotel, Claremont Hill, Shrewsbury. It may be both accounts are true, with a get-together at The Lion being finalised at the Turf.\n\nAfter friendlies and regional cup competitions for the first few seasons, Shrewsbury were founder members of the Shropshire & District League in [[1890\u201391 in English football|1890\u201391]], later admitted to the [[West Midlands (Regional) League|Birmingham & District League]] in [[1895\u201396 in English football|1895\u201396]]. Many of the teams Town faced in the early days have vanished, however Shrewsbury met many of today's Football League and Conference teams, including [[Crewe Alexandra F.C.|Crewe Alexandra]], [[Coventry City F.C.|Coventry City]], [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]], [[Kidderminster Harriers F.C.|Kidderminster Harriers]] and [[Stafford Rangers F.C.|Stafford Rangers]].\n\nIn 1910, Shrewsbury looked to move to a new ground, having spent early years at locations across the town, notably at [[Copthorne Barracks]] west of the town. The club moved to [[Gay Meadow]] on the edge of the town centre, within sight of [[Shrewsbury Abbey]], and stayed 97 years.<ref>{{cite news |title=Shrewsbury Town History |url=http://www.shrewsburytown.com/page/History/0,,10443,00.html |publisher=Shrewsbury Town |date=11 Jul 2007 |accessdate=11 January 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120223182510/http://www.shrewsburytown.com/page/History/0,,10443,00.html |archivedate=23 February 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nShrewsbury's Birmingham League days were mostly mid-table, with a few seasons challenging near the top, the club being league champions in [[1922\u201323 in English football|1922\u201323]].\n\nA move to the Midland Champions League in [[1937\u201338 in English football|1937\u201338]] saw the club enjoy one of its most successful seasons, winning a league and cup treble. Shrewsbury were league champions, scoring 111 goals . In addition, the [[Welsh Cup]] was won following a replay, the team enjoyed a run in the [[FA Cup]], and won the [[Shropshire Senior Cup]].\n\nAfter a run of good seasons in post-war years, Shrewsbury were admitted, alongside [[Scunthorpe United]] to the old Division 3 (North) of the Football League in 1950, after being Midland League champions in [[1949\u201350 in English football|1949\u201350]], following the decision to expand from 88 to 92 clubs.\n\n===Football League history===\n[[File:Shrewsbury Town FC League Performance.svg|225px|thumb|Chart of yearly table positions of The Shrews in the Football League.]]\n\nShrewsbury gained their first promotion, to the [[Football League Third Division|Third Division]], in [[1958\u201359 in English football|1958\u201359]]. They remained in the third tier 15 years, slipping back to Division Four at the end of [[1973\u201374 in English football|1973\u201374]].\n\n1960\u201361 season saw Shrewsbury Town reach the Semi Final of the [[League Cup]]. After beating [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] in the quarter-finals, they narrowly lost over two legs 4\u20133 on aggregate to [[Rotherham United]]. This era was also remembered for [[Arthur Rowley]]. He arrived from [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]] in 1958, the club's first player/manager. During his playing and managerial career, he broke [[Dixie Dean]]'s goal-scoring record, scoring his 380th league goal against [[Bradford City A.F.C.|Bradford City]] at [[Valley Parade]] on 29 April 1961. Retiring from playing in 1965 he remained manager until July 1968.\n\nShrewsbury were promoted to the Third Division in [[1974\u201375 in English football|1974\u201375]] as runners-up, before another successful season in [[1978\u201379 in English football|1978\u201379]], when they were league champions under [[Richie Barker (footballer, born 1939)|Ritchie Barker]] and later [[Graham Turner]].  Over 14,000 fans packed [[Gay Meadow]] on 17 May 1979 to see Shrewsbury seal promotion with a 4\u20131 win over [[Exeter City F.C.|Exeter City]]. In addition, the club had their first run to the FA Cup quarter-finals, before a replay defeat to [[Wolverhampton Wanderers]]. Turner is the team's most successful manager, winning the Third Division Championship in 1978\u201379 \u2013 his first season in charge \u2013 to take the club into the [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]] for the first time.<ref name=\"guardian\" /> They remained for ten years, although Turner departed for [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] in 1984.<ref name=\"steps\" /> Shrewsbury repeated their 1979 feat of reaching the quarter-final in [[1981\u201382 in English football|1981\u201382]], defeating [[UEFA Cup]] holders [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]] in the fifth round before defeat away to [[Leicester City]].\n\nThe 1980s saw many big teams defeated by Shrewsbury, whose period in the old Second Division coincided with some of the current [[Premier League]] clubs. During the 1980s, [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]], [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]], [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]], [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] and [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] lost to Shrewsbury Town. [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]] were defeated at Gay Meadow at the end of [[1985\u201386 in English football|1985\u201386]], Shrewsbury winning 2\u20131, relegating Middlesbrough, who went out of business and almost out of existence.  The match was marred by violence from Middlesbrough fans, with many of them later having to return to Shrewsbury for court appearances.\n\nIn the early to mid-1980s the club enjoyed its most successful Football League run. Shrewsbury survived through the sale of players, with some to have played for Shrewsbury including [[Steve Ogrizovic]], [[David Moyes]], [[John McGinlay]] and [[Bernard McNally]]. They were relegated at the end of 1988\u201389 after ten years. In the Third Division, on 22 December 1990, [[Gary Shaw]] scored the quickest Town hat trick \u2013 4&nbsp;minutes and 32&nbsp;seconds \u2013 against [[Bradford City]] at [[Valley Parade]].  At the end of [[1991\u201392 in English football|1991\u201392]], three years after relegation to the Third Division, the club was relegated to the Fourth \u2013 the first time since 1975.\nHowever, two seasons later Shrewsbury won the new ''(fourth tier)'' Division Three championship under Fred Davies in [[1993\u201394 in English football|1993\u201394]], and remained in Division Two ''(third tier)'' three seasons. Shrewsbury were not to rise any further, remaining mid-table before slipping down again at the end of [[1996\u201397 in English football|1996\u201397]].\n\nThe 1990s saw Shrewsbury make their first appearance at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley]] as finalists in the 1996 [[Football League Trophy]] final. Shrewsbury lost 2\u20131 to [[Rotherham United F.C.|Rotherham United]]; future Shrewsbury striker [[Nigel Jemson]] scoring both Rotherham goals. Davies was sacked at the end of the 1996\u201397 relegation season. [[Jake King]] arrived, following a successful reign at local rivals [[Telford United F.C.|Telford United]].\n\n===Kevin Ratcliffe era and Conference===\n[[File:Shrewsbury Town Loggerheads Crest.png|200px|thumb|Loggerheads emblem used by the club between 1993 and 2007]]\nIn the 1999\u20132000, Shrewsbury endured a poor season, with King being sacked in November as the club near relegation. Former [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] captain and Welsh international [[Kevin Ratcliffe]] was appointed manager and saved them from relegation to the [[Football Conference|Conference]] on the final day of the season with a 2\u20131 victory away to [[Exeter City F.C.|Exeter City]].\n\nRatcliffe worked on improving the side. Former youth team and reserve player [[Luke Rodgers]] emerged as a regular goal-scorer, and with big names arriving at Shrewsbury, the team looked on the up, narrowly missing the [[2001\u201302 in English football|2001\u201302]] league playoffs despite 70 points.\n\nThe 2002\u201303 saw Shrewsbury enjoy an FA Cup run. After dispatching non-league sides [[Stafford Rangers F.C.|Stafford Rangers]] and [[Barrow A.F.C.|Barrow]], they won at home against [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] in the third round in front of 7,800, with two goals by Nigel Jemson.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Porter|first1=Steve|title=Shrewsbury Town 2\u20131 Everton|url=http://www.thegiantkillers.co.uk/2003shrewsbury.htm|website=www.thegiantkillers.co.uk|accessdate=5 May 2016}}</ref> [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] were the fourth round visitors, in a televised match on BBC's ''[[Match of the Day]]''. Town lost 0\u20134, with [[Gianfranco Zola]] the man of the match. A near capacity crowd of 7,950 turned up for Chelsea, but from then on, the side's form disappeared, picking up just two wins in the league thereafter. Seven points adrift at the bottom and having conceded 92 goals, the club contemplated the end of their 53 years in the league. Following angry demonstrations from fans, Ratcliffe resigned, and [[Mark Atkins (footballer)|Mark Atkins]] took temporary charge for the club final League game, a 2\u20131 defeat to [[Scunthorpe United F.C.|Scunthorpe United]], who were coincidentally the first League opponents for Shrewsbury Town back in 1950.\n\n[[Northwich Victoria]] manager [[Jimmy Quinn (Northern Ireland footballer)|Jimmy Quinn]] was appointed Shrewsbury manager in May 2003, with the aim of getting them promoted back to the Football League at the first attempt. With most of the previous year's players released, Quinn assembled a whole new squad, with experienced non-league players such as [[Darren Tinson]] and [[Jake Sedgemore]] being joined by [[Colin Cramb]], [[Scott Howie]] and former League Cup finalist [[Martin O'Connor (footballer)|Martin O'Connor]]. The league title went to [[Chester City F.C.|Chester City]], but with 74 points, Shrewsbury finished third in the league and defeated [[Barnet F.C.|Barnet]] in the playoff semi-finals to set up a playoff final against [[Aldershot Town F.C.|Aldershot Town]], at the neutral venue of the [[Britannia Stadium]], home of [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]]. The two teams [[Conference National Playoff Final 2004|played out a 1\u20131 draw]] which went to a [[penalty shoot-out (association football)|penalty shootout]].

However, blue has not always been the most dominant colour. Early kits included blue and white stripes, quartered shirts and all-blue shirts, which were worn with either white or amber trim until 1978. In 1978 Shrewsbury's most famous kit was introduced \u2013 the blue and amber stripes, which they wore as they were promoted in successive seasons, up to the old second division (now the Football League Championship). This was the design worn by character Derek Smalls in the movie ''[[This Is Spinal Tap]]''.\n\nThe club was not loyal to the stripes for long, and in 1982 reverted to a blue shirt, then used a blue body with amber sleeves, later reverting to an amber body with blue sleeves. In 1987 the shirts radically changed to white shirts for four seasons before reverting to stripes in 1991\u201392. After a flamboyant abstract pattern on the shirts in 1992\u201393, Shrewsbury's kits have stayed mostly blue, with amber stripe(s) of some description evident since 1999.\n\nThe shirt sponsors have, since their introduction in 1982 until 2017, all been local companies. As of the [[2017\u201318 Shrewsbury Town F.C. season|2017\u201318 season]], the current shirt sponsor is The Energy Check, a [[South Shields]]-based Energy management company.\n\n==Club crest==\n\nThe first crest to appear on the shirt of Shrewsbury Town was the town's coat of arms, [[Shrewsbury#Coat of arms|The Loggerheads]] in 1907. The crest was used intermittently on shirts until 1960 through to 1970, when a generic football design was used. During this time, The Loggerheads continued to be used on other merchandise, such as match-day programmes. The Loggerheads returned in 1970, and in various guises continued to be used until 1986, when a \"Shrew\" cartoon was introduced as the club's crest in an attempt to rebrand \"Salop\" as \"The Shrews\".<ref name=\"historicalkits.co.uk\">{{cite web|url=http://www.historicalkits.co.uk/Shrewsbury_Town/Shrewsbury_Town.htm|title=Shrewsbury Town \u2013 Historical Football Kits|website=www.historicalkits.co.uk}}</ref> During this time, the club's kit was also changed to predominantly white. A campaign by fanzine a \"A Large Scotch\" eventually led to the return of The Loggerheads crest in 1992.<ref name=\"historicalkits.co.uk\" /> The crest changed once in again in 2007 to coincide with Salop's move to [[New Meadow]], the new badge featured a single lion's head in a circle. The club stated that the new badge was necessary as any design incorporating The Loggerheads could not be copyrighted.\n\n{| style=\"margin:0 auto;\"\n| [[File:Shrewsbury Town Loggerheads Crest.png|thumb|upright|1993\u20132007]]\n| [[File:Shrewsbury Town badge 2007-2015.png|thumb|upright|2007\u20132015]]\n| [[File:Shrewsbury Town F.C.

The group, usually based in block 8 of the South Stand, organise choreography and flag displays. Their first fundraiser raised over \u00a31000 which funded the purchase of 50 new flags.

Centre half turned centre forward [[Alf Wood (footballer, born 1945)|Alf Wood]] scored 5 goals in the 7\u20131 victory against Blackburn Rovers in 1971 and became the first player since Dixie Dean to score four headed goals in one match.\n\n====Famous names====\n[[File:David Moyes.jpg|thumb|Manager [[David Moyes]] played for Shrewsbury from 1987 to 1990]]\nSeveral Shrewsbury players have gone onto, or came from prominent top-flight careers. These include current and former top-flight managers [[David Moyes]], [[Nigel Pearson]], [[Gordon Lee (footballer)|Gordon Lee]], [[David Pleat]] and [[Gary Megson]]. International stars [[John McGinlay]], [[Jim Holton]], [[Jimmy Quinn (Northern Ireland footballer)|Jimmy Quinn]], Michael Gulla (American footballer), Jimmy McLoughlin, [[Mickey Thomas (football)|Mickey Thomas]], [[Carl Robinson]] and [[Neville Southall]] all spent time at Shrewsbury. [[Doug Rougvie]] won the [[European Cup Winners' Cup]] with [[Aberdeen F.C.|Aberdeen]] in 1983 and played for Shrewsbury later in the decade after a spell at [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]].\n\nMore recently, Premier League winner [[Mark Atkins (footballer)|Mark Atkins]] spent later seasons of his career at Shrewsbury, as did [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday's]] [[Nigel Jemson]] and former Nottingham Forest player [[Ian Woan]]. Coventry City stalwart [[Steve Ogrizovic]] was previously a Shrewsbury player. Two notable recent departees are local-born youth products, England goalkeeper [[Joe Hart]] and Wales midfielder [[David Edwards (footballer)|David Edwards]], both of whom have been capped at U21 and senior international levels. Edwards went on to play in the [[Premier League]] with [[Wolverhampton Wanderers]] and the [[Wales national football team|Wales national team]] and returned to Shrewsbury in January 2019. Hart was a regular in the [[England national football team|England senior team]].\n\n====Local players====\nIn addition to Hart and Edwards, Shrewsbury have given opportunities to many young local players, who have forged successful professional careers. [[Norman Hobson]] was a local Shrewsbury born defender in the mid to late 1950s and made 224 appearances. [[Bernard McNally]] was a local star in the 1980s, with two other local players, [[Kevin Seabury]] and [[Peter Wilding]] being fan favourites at the club in the 1990s. Veteran striker [[Andy Cooke]] was born and raised in Shrewsbury, and supported the club as a boy, but forged his career elsewhere after being rejected as a trainee. [[Tom Bradshaw (footballer, born 1992)|Tom Bradshaw]] is a recent Shrewsbury-born talent to have emerged from the Youth Team, and [[Mason Springthorpe]] signed for Everton prior to making an appearance for the Shrews, for \u00a3125,000.<ref>{{cite news|title=Everton sign young Shrewsbury keeper Mason Springthorpe|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/s/shrewsbury/9397031.stm|accessdate=9 April 2015|work=BBC Sport|date=16 February 2011}}</ref>\n\n====Cult heroes====\nIn 2004, the BBC's ''[[Football Focus]]'' ran polls to determine club's [[cult hero]]es, and [[Dean Spink]] was named as Shrewsbury's cult hero, ahead of [[Steve Anthrobus]] and [[Austin Berkley (footballer)|Austin Berkley]].<ref>{{Cite news| title=Shrewsbury's cult heroes |work=BBC Sport | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/football_focus/3598134.stm | accessdate=21 June 2007  | date=4 September 2004}}</ref>\n\n==Managerial history==\n{{colbegin}}\n* Sir Trevor Brian Evans 1886\u20131905.\n** Former olympian and local man, who took over the side from the \"Castle Blues\" and was the first manager of the club when they became Shrewsbury Town\n* [[W.

[[Prokaryotic]] and [[eukaryotic]] ribosomes both contain a [[wiktionary:scaffold|scaffold]] of [[ribosomal RNA]] (rRNA) on which are arrayed an extensive variety of [[ribosomal protein]]s (RP).<ref name=\"Ban2014\"/> Ribosomopathies can arise from abnormalities of either rRNA or the various RPs.\n\nThe nomenclature of rRNA subunits is derived from each component's [[Svedberg|Svedberg unit]], which is an [[ultracentrifuge]] [[sedimentation coefficient]], that is affected by mass and also shape. These S units of the rRNA subunits cannot simply be added because they represent measures of sedimentation rate rather than of mass. [[eukaryotic ribosome (80S)|Eukaryotic ribosome]]s are somewhat larger and more complex than prokaryotic ribosomes. The overall 80S eukaryotic  rRNA structure is composed of a [[eukaryotic large ribosomal subunit (60S)|large 60S subunit]] (LSU) and a [[eukaryotic small ribosomal subunit (40S)|small 40S subunit]] (SSU).<ref name=\"Ruggero2014\"/>\n\nIn humans, a single transcription unit separated by 2 [[Internal transcribed spacer|internally transcribed spacers]] encodes a precursor, [[preribosomal RNA|45S]]. The precursor 45S rDNA is organized into 5 clusters (each has 30-40 repeats) on chromosomes 13, 14, 15, 21, and 22. These are transcribed in the [[nucleolus]] by [[RNA polymerase I]]. 45S is processed in the nucleus via 32S rRNA to [[28S ribosomal RNA|28S]]<ref name=\"28S\"/> and [[5.8S ribosomal RNA|5.8S]],<ref  name=\"5.8S\"/> and via 30S  to [[18S ribosomal RNA|18S]],<ref  name=\"18S\"/> as shown in the diagram. 18S is a component of the ribosomal 40S subunit. 28S, 5.8S and [[5S ribosomal RNA|5S]],<ref  name=\"5S\"/> which is transcribed independently, are components of 60S. The 5S DNA occurs in [[Tandemly arrayed genes|tandem arrays]] (~200-300 true 5S genes and many dispersed [[pseudogene]]s); the largest is on chromosome 1q41-42. 5S rRNA is transcribed by [[RNA polymerase III]].<ref name=\"Ruggero2014\"/> It is not fully clear why rRNA is processed in this way rather than being directly transcribed as mature rRNA, but the sequential steps may have a role in the proper folding of rRNA or in subsequent RP assembly.\n\nThe products of this processing within the [[cell nucleus]] are the four principal types of cytoplasmic rRNA: 28S, 5.8S, 18S, and 5S subunits.<ref name=\"Hoffbrand_2011_6\"/>{{rp|291}} and (cite)(cite) (Mammalian cells also have 2 types of mitochondrial rRNA molecules, [[12S ribosomal RNA|12S]] and [[MT-RNR2|16S]].)

[[Oncogenes]], like [[c-Myc]], can upregulate [[Ribosomal DNA|rDNA]] transcription in a direct and indirect fashion. Tumor suppressors like Rb and [[p53]], on the other hand, can suppress ribosome biogenesis. Additionally, the nucleolus is an important cellular sensor for stress and plays a key role in the activation of p53.\n\nRibosomopathy has been linked to the pathology of various malignancies.<ref name=\"Raiser2014\"/> Several ribosomopathies are associated with an increased rate of cancer. For example, both SDS and 5q- syndrome lead to impaired [[hematopoiesis]] and a predisposition to [[leukemia]].<ref name=\"Burwick2012\"/> Additionally, acquired defects in ribosomal proteins that have not been implicated in congenital ribosomopathies have been found in [[T-lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma]], [[stomach cancer]] and [[ovarian cancer]].<ref name=\"DeKeersmaecker2015\"/>\n\nNew cancer therapies might therefore target ribosome biogenesis specifically. As of 2014, two experimental agents inhibit RNA polymerase I by disrupting the rDNA promoter complex: CX-5461 activates p53 via nuclear stress and induces [[apoptosis]] of [[leukemia]] and [[lymphoma]] cells while leaving normal cells unharmed; BMH-21, inhibits rDNA transcription and induces nucleolar capping or nucleolar reorganization. This nucleolar stress eventually causes decreased cell proliferation and death. It also activates p-53 but p-53 activation was not required for the drug to be effective. The promise of these drugs is that they leave healthy cell DNA unharmed and specifically target the fact that cancer cells rely heavily on ribosome biogenesis. It has been said that ribosome biogenesis is the \u201cAchilles heel in cancer cells.\u201d <ref name=\"vanSluis2014\"/>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2|refs=\n\n<--KEEP: This reference list is organized alphanumerically by arbitrary ref name-->\n<!--FOR REDACTION: working template area\n\n<generally here, the ref name follows the format of <ref name=\"AuthorYYYY\">-->\n\n<ref name=\"Sondalle2014\">{{cite journal |authors=Sondalle SB, Baserga SJ |title=Human diseases of the SSU processome |journal=Biochim.

[[Oncogenes]], like [[c-Myc]], can upregulate [[Ribosomal DNA|rDNA]] transcription in a direct and indirect fashion. Tumor suppressors like Rb and [[p53]], on the other hand, can suppress ribosome biogenesis. Additionally, the nucleolus is an important cellular sensor for stress and plays a key role in the activation of p53.\n\nRibosomopathy has been linked to the pathology of various malignancies.<ref name=\"Raiser2014\"/> Several ribosomopathies are associated with an increased rate of cancer. For example, both SDS and 5q- syndrome lead to impaired [[hematopoiesis]] and a predisposition to [[leukemia]].<ref name=\"Burwick2012\"/> Additionally, acquired defects in ribosomal proteins that have not been implicated in congenital ribosomopathies have been found in [[T-lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma]], [[stomach cancer]] and [[ovarian cancer]].<ref name=\"DeKeersmaecker2015\"/>\n\nNew cancer therapies might therefore target ribosome biogenesis specifically. As of 2014, two experimental agents inhibit RNA polymerase I by disrupting the rDNA promoter complex: CX-5461 activates p53 via nuclear stress and induces [[apoptosis]] of [[leukemia]] and [[lymphoma]] cells while leaving normal cells unharmed; BMH-21, inhibits rDNA transcription and induces nucleolar capping or nucleolar reorganization. This nucleolar stress eventually causes decreased cell proliferation and death. It also activates p-53 but p-53 activation was not required for the drug to be effective. The promise of these drugs is that they leave healthy cell DNA unharmed and specifically target the fact that cancer cells rely heavily on ribosome biogenesis. It has been said that ribosome biogenesis is the \u201cAchilles heel in cancer cells.\u201d <ref name=\"vanSluis2014\"/>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2|refs=\n\n<--KEEP: This reference list is organized alphanumerically by arbitrary ref name-->\n<!--FOR REDACTION: working template area\n\n<generally here, the ref name follows the format of <ref name=\"AuthorYYYY\">-->\n\n<ref name=\"Sondalle2014\">{{cite journal |authors=Sondalle SB, Baserga SJ |title=Human diseases of the SSU processome |journal=Biochim.

The team was founded in 1959 and joined [[FIFA]] in 1969. In the past, they have also frequently featured in the Malaysian league and cup competitions as [[Brunei M-League Team|one of the state representative sides]].\n\n==History==\nBrunei Football Association was formed on 15 March 1956 and at that time was known as the Brunei State Football Amateur Association. In 1993, the word \"Amateur\" was dropped, and since then, the FA has been known as the [[Football Association of Brunei Darussalam]]. Brunei's experience of international football has been more or less restricted to regional Asian competitions, such as the [[Southeast Asian Games]] and the [[Tiger Cup]]. So far, Brunei has entered the [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] qualifiers only three times, in [[1986 FIFA World Cup|1986]], [[2002 FIFA World Cup|2002]] and [[2018 FIFA World Cup|2018]]. On these occasions, they did not qualify for the competition. They have made five appearances in the [[Asian Cup]] qualifiers, but they have never passed the first qualification round.\n\nTheir best achievement was perhaps being Champion of the Malaysia Cup in 1999. Back then, Brunei [[Brunei M-League Team|entered a team]] to compete in the professional Malaysian league and despite competing against Malaysian clubs, Brunei had previously never made an impact. However, in 1999, they shocked everyone by lifting the Malaysia Cup.\n\nToday there are approximately 2,500 footballers playing with Brunei's 22 registered clubs. Footballers are mostly amateurs or semi professionals.\n\n===Suspension===\nIn September 2009, the [[Football Association of Brunei Darussalam]] (BAFA) was suspended due to governmental interference in its affairs, which started with a decision by the Brunei authorities to dissolve BAFA and to replace it with a new federation in December 2008.<ref>{{cite

suspension was applied with immediate effect and meant that the Brunei club [[Brunei DPMM FC|DPMM]] were no longer permitted to play in the Singapore [[S.League|S-League]] until it was resolved.\n\nOn 19 March 2010, the [[FIFA Executive Committee]] agreed to submit to the next [[FIFA Congress]] the expulsion of the Football Association of Brunei Darussalam (BAFA) if the BAFA has not been reinstated by then, after noting that no major progress had been made since the BAFA was suspended in September 2009.\n\nFIFA warned that unless BAFA came to FIFA's Congress on 9 June and 10 in South Africa having met the conditions for reinstatement it would be expelled.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.the-afc.com/en/member-association-news/asean-news/27780-brunei-darussalam-face-expulsion

The team was founded in 1959 and joined [[FIFA]] in 1969. In the past, they have also frequently featured in the Malaysian league and cup competitions as [[Brunei M-League Team|one of the state representative sides]].\n\n==History==\nBrunei Football Association was formed on 15 March 1956 and at that time was known as the Brunei State Football Amateur Association. In 1993, the word \"Amateur\" was dropped, and since then, the FA has been known as the [[Football Association of Brunei Darussalam]]. Brunei's experience of international football has been more or less restricted to regional Asian competitions, such as the [[Southeast Asian Games]] and the [[Tiger Cup]]. So far, Brunei has entered the [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] qualifiers only three times, in [[1986 FIFA World Cup|1986]], [[2002 FIFA World Cup|2002]] and [[2018 FIFA World Cup|2018]]. On these occasions, they did not qualify for the competition. They have made five appearances in the [[Asian Cup]] qualifiers, but they have never passed the first qualification round.\n\nTheir best achievement was perhaps being Champion of the Malaysia Cup in 1999. Back then, Brunei [[Brunei M-League Team|entered a team]] to compete in the professional Malaysian league and despite competing against Malaysian clubs, Brunei had previously never made an impact. However, in 1999, they shocked everyone by lifting the Malaysia Cup.\n\nToday there are approximately 2,500 footballers playing with Brunei's 22 registered clubs. Footballers are mostly amateurs or semi professionals.\n\n===Suspension===\nIn September 2009, the [[Football Association of Brunei Darussalam]] (BAFA) was suspended due to governmental interference in its affairs, which started with a decision by the Brunei authorities to dissolve BAFA and to replace it with a new federation in December 2008.<ref>{{cite

suspension was applied with immediate effect and meant that the Brunei club [[Brunei DPMM FC|DPMM]] were no longer permitted to play in the Singapore [[S.League|S-League]] until it was resolved.\n\nOn 19 March 2010, the [[FIFA Executive Committee]] agreed to submit to the next [[FIFA Congress]] the expulsion of the Football Association of Brunei Darussalam (BAFA) if the BAFA has not been reinstated by then, after noting that no major progress had been made since the BAFA was suspended in September 2009.\n\nFIFA warned that unless BAFA came to FIFA's Congress on 9 June and 10 in South Africa having met the conditions for reinstatement it would be expelled.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.the-afc.com/en/member-association-news/asean-news/27780-brunei-darussalam-face-expulsion
