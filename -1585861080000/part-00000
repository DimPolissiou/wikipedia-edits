He accepts many different assassination jobs from anyone who can afford his services. From simply shooting a violin string to taking out powerful organized crime bosses and political figures, these killings have often attracted retaliations against Golgo 13, even at one stage having both the FBI, CIA, and even the United States military out to kill him, causing Togo to always have to watch his own back and pay attention to his surroundings in order to stop other assassins and contract killers employed to kill him in often creative ways. Golgo 13 also employs many different people himself to assist him in his assassination jobs, such as in providing extra information on his targets to modifying his weapons, vehicles, and gadgets.\n\nThe name \"Golgo 13\" is a reference to [[Crucifixion of Jesus|the death of Jesus Christ]]. ''Golgo'' is short for [[Calvary|Golgotha]], the place of [[Jesus Christ|Jesus]]' crucifixion, while the [[13 (number)|number 13]] is considered an unlucky number.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ex.org/5.6/30-anime_golgo.html|title=Anime Reviews: ''The Professional''|last=Washington|first=Darius|publisher=EX: The Online World of Anime & Manga|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070608105138/http://www.ex.org/5.6/30-anime_golgo.html|archive-date=8 June 2007|url-status=dead|access-date=19 October 2016}}</ref> Also, Golgo 13's logo is a skeleton wearing a [[crown of thorns]].\n\nDuke Togo's past is a mystery.

He accepts many different assassination jobs from anyone who can afford his services. From simply shooting a violin string to taking out powerful organized crime bosses and political figures, these killings have often attracted retaliations against Golgo 13, even at one stage having both the FBI, CIA, and even the United States military out to kill him, causing Togo to always have to watch his own back and pay attention to his surroundings in order to stop other assassins and contract killers employed to kill him in often creative ways. Golgo 13 also employs many different people himself to assist him in his assassination jobs, such as in providing extra information on his targets to modifying his weapons, vehicles, and gadgets.\n\nThe name \"Golgo 13\" is a reference to [[Crucifixion of Jesus|the death of Jesus Christ]]. ''Golgo'' is short for [[Calvary|Golgotha]], the place of [[Jesus Christ|Jesus]]' crucifixion, while the [[13 (number)|number 13]] is considered an unlucky number.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ex.org/5.6/30-anime_golgo.html|title=Anime Reviews: ''The Professional''|last=Washington|first=Darius|publisher=EX: The Online World of Anime & Manga|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070608105138/http://www.ex.org/5.6/30-anime_golgo.html|archive-date=8 June 2007|url-status=dead|access-date=19 October 2016}}</ref> Also, Golgo 13's logo is a skeleton wearing a [[crown of thorns]].\n\nDuke Togo's past is a mystery.

In 1895, as a 20-year-old newcomer to Dallas County, Sumners persuaded the Dallas City Attorney, Alfred P.

He was quoted as saying, \"There are but two sorts of government \u2013 a government by the people and a government the voice of which comes from the top downward.

Sumners said that the bill's sponsors did not have adequate statistics to prove their case (that lynching should be a federal crime), that the bill would increase racial mob violence.

Roosevelt announced his so-called [[Judiciary Reorganization Bill of 1937|court-packing plan]] in 1936. As Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Sumners discreetly worked in opposition. When the plan's bill was in trouble, Sumners reportedly said, \"Boys, here's where I cash in my chips,\" referring to his waning support for the President.<ref name=\"TexasHandbook\" />  Ultimately, Chairman Sumners came out formally against the Court-packing plan. He and two other Texans, Vice President [[John Nance Garner]] and Senator [[Tom Connally|Thomas T. Connally]], led the fight against the court plan because they saw the president\u2019s request as a symbolic desire for unlimited power. Sumners, as chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, decided that the reorganization bill would not come up in his committee, because he wanted to avoid it being sent to and passing in the full House. He traveled around the country making speeches about constitutional government.

Less than a decade after he challenged the Dyer Anti-Lynching Bill, Sumners wrote in response to 1931 Mississippi lynchings, \u201cWhat we want to do is to have a meeting to oppose lynchings in Mississippi and to see if we can get Mississippi to do something about it, and if we can get other states to become more effective in suppressing lynchings.\u201d<ref>Personal letter to Mrs. Jessie Danie Ames, May 12, 1931, Dallas Historical Society, HWS Collection, D-75.8    </ref>\n\nIn the wake of The Lynching of Roosevelt Townes and Robert McDaniels 1937 Sumners received a request to speak about the anti-lynching legislation to the Mississippi Council of Southern Women for the Prevention of Lynching, but declined writing, \u201cit has occurred to me that it would not be good strategy for me to make an address on the subject suggested at the Public Meeting to be held by your Council at [[Jackson, Mississippi|Jackson]] on May 27<sup>th</sup>.

It is the sort of thing which makes it hard for us who are trying to protect the governmental sovereignty of the states.  It will be effectively seized upon as a demonstration of the ability of states to govern. As one Southern man to another, I hope I will not be considered impertinent by stating candidly my own reaction and that is that the State of Mississippi cannot escape this reflection upon its governmental capacity, in fact cannot escape in effect becoming an accessory after the fact unless it is able to and does bring these lynchers and officers to speedy and adequate punishment\u201d<ref>Western Union Telegram to Honorable Hugh White, Governor of Mississippi, April 14, 1937, Dallas Historical Society, HWS Collection, D-97.6.</ref> Sumners called for justice against anyone involved in the now infamous lynching including the Sheriffs writing, \u201cthe turning over of a prisoner, regardless of the crime charged against him, for execution by some agency other than that provided by the laws of the country is a confession of unfitness to govern.\u201d<ref>Personal letter to Attorney General of Alabama, A.

He rose to become Chairman of the powerful [[House Judiciary Committee]].\n\n==Early life and career==\nHatton Sumners, the second of three children of William A. and Anna Elizabeth Walker Sumners, was born near [[Fayetteville, Tennessee]] on May 30, 1875. He grew up on a farm in Lincoln County and attended local schools.<ref name=Sumners>[https://baylorarchives.cuadra.com/cgi-bin/starfetch.exe?QgID14lsjbYp8zWJvsu0Wt8HlfdX6ps3oLYSzUh9HPLokzGHPuBb3ixgF6QcwJkjAaMaKFHQXxMOGIWJlR48sGx@nuLe@m1XnRv@p1uDMN4/0007e3.xml Hatton Sumners Papers] #91, Baylor Collections of Political Materials, W.

In 1895, as a 20-year-old newcomer to Dallas County, Sumners persuaded the Dallas City Attorney, Alfred P. Wozencraft, to let him \"[[read law]]\" in his office, a common alternative to law school.<ref>[http://www.oldred.org/history/social_history_1.html Old Red Museum, Dallas County Historical Society] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070629012503/http://www.oldred.org/history/social_history_1.html |date=June 29, 2007 }}</ref> Sumners was admitted to the bar in 1897 and commenced practice in Dallas.\n\nSumners was elected as prosecuting attorney of [[Dallas County, Texas|Dallas County]] in 1900, serving two non-consecutive terms.  As [[prosecutor]], he brought charges against gamblers in an attempt to clean up Dallas.  As a result of his investigations and his campaign against drinking and vice, Sumners was not re-elected in 1902.<ref name=TexasHandbook>\n{{cite web\n |url=http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fsu04\n |title=SUMNERS, HATTON WILLIAM\n |accessdate=2008-11-02 |author= |last= |first= |authorlink= |date= |year= \n |month= |work=Handbook of Texas Online\n |publisher= |pages= |language= |doi= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= }}\n</ref> He continued his campaign against gambling and voting irregularities in Dallas, ultimately influencing state legislation enacted to reform the system. After that, Sumners was elected Dallas County prosecutor again.  Instead of continuing in that position for additional terms, he accepted the presidency of the district and county attorneys' association of Texas in 1906 and 1907, where he campaigned against betting interests.<ref name=TexasHandbook/>\n\n==Service in Congress==\nSumners ran for and was elected in 1912 to an [[Texas's At-large congressional district|at-large seat]] as a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] to the Sixty-third Congress, taking office on March 4, 1913.  He was the first of the 132 freshmen congressmen in that Congress to get a bill through the House; the bill made Dallas a port of entry for US Customs.<ref name=TexasHandbook/>  In 1914, he ran for the seat from [[Texas's 5th congressional district]], which included [[Dallas]], Ellis, [[Rockwall County, Texas|Rockwall]], Hill, and Bosque counties, and he was elected.<ref name=TexasHandbook/>\n\nSumners was a lifetime defender of states' rights. He was quoted as saying, \"There are but two sorts of government \u2013 a government by the people and a government the voice of which comes from the top downward. With us more and more, the voice of the government is spoken in Washington downward to the people. What we need in America is a people conscious of their responsibility, conscious of their power, conscious they are the government and then get on the job.\"<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Sumners|first=Hatton|date=February 19, 1942|title=We the People|url=|journal=National Association of Retail Druggists Journal|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref>\n\nIn the 1920s, Sumners spoke out against the [[Dyer Anti-Lynching Bill]], introduced by a Republican congressman from [[St. Louis|Saint Louis, Missouri]]. Sumners said that the bill's sponsors did not have adequate statistics to prove their case (that lynching should be a federal crime), that the bill would increase racial mob violence. Sumners also questioned the constitutionality of the bill and posited the bill ultimately impinged on [[states' rights]].<ref>[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1922/01/05/98966810.pdf \"Filibuster Delays Anti-Lynching Bill,\" ''New York Times,'' January 5, 1922]</ref> He believed part of the solution to end lynching would start with local sentiment.

Taft]] and worked with him to pass a bill amending the judicial code, also known as the \"Judges Bill.\" Sumners appeared before the Supreme Court several times on behalf of Congress, including for the Pocket Veto Case of 1928, the McCracken Contempt Case of 1934, and the Municipal Bankruptcy Act Case of 1936.<ref name=\"Sumners\" /> Sumners became Chairman of the Judiciary Committee in 1932.<ref name=\"TexasHandbook\" /> In 1934, he drafted a constitution for the [[Philippines]], developing a reputation as an authority on constitutional law.<ref name=\"Sumners\" /> Sumners was responsible for bringing the [[Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas|Federal Reserve Bank]] to Dallas.<ref name=\":0\" /> As a loyal Democrat, he supported much of President [[Franklin Roosevelt]]'s [[New Deal]] legislation.\n\nHe drew the line at Roosevelt's plan to expand the US Supreme Court, after the Court began to rule that key parts of the New Deal were unconstitutional. Roosevelt announced his so-called [[Judiciary Reorganization Bill of 1937|court-packing plan]] in 1936. As Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Sumners discreetly worked in opposition. When the plan's bill was in trouble, Sumners reportedly said, \"Boys, here's where I cash in my chips,\" referring to his waning support for the President.<ref name=\"TexasHandbook\" />  Ultimately, Chairman Sumners came out formally against the Court-packing plan. He and two other Texans, Vice President [[John Nance Garner]] and Senator [[Tom Connally|Thomas T. Connally]], led the fight against the court plan because they saw the president\u2019s request as a symbolic desire for unlimited power. Sumners, as chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, decided that the reorganization bill would not come up in his committee, because he wanted to avoid it being sent and passing in the House. Sumners traveled around the country making speeches about constitutional government. The bill never left his committee.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/jzc01|title=COURT-PACKING PLAN OF 1937|last=PATENAUDE|first=LIONEL V.|date=2010-06-12|website=tshaonline.org|language=en|access-date=2019-01-15}}</ref>\n\nHe faced two serious opponents in the 1938 election, but was re-elected and was not seriously challenged again. In 1945, Sumners responded strongly to the lynching of Jesse James Payne, a prisoner in custody of Sheriff Davis in [[Madison, Florida|Madison, FL]]. Sheriff Davis was investigated for any wrongdoing associated with the lynching of Jesse James Payne.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Davis|first=Jack.

Less than a decade after he challenged the Dyer Anti-Lynching Bill, Sumners wrote in response to 1931 Mississippi lynchings, \u201cWhat we want to do is to have a meeting to oppose lynchings in Mississippi and to see if we can get Mississippi to do something about it, and if we can get other states to become more effective in suppressing lynchings.\u201d<ref>Personal letter to Mrs. Jessie Danie Ames, May 12, 1931, Dallas Historical Society, HWS Collection, D-75.8    </ref>\n\nIn the wake of The Lynching of Roosevelt Townes and Robert McDaniels 1937 Sumners received a request to speak about the anti-lynching legislation to the Mississippi Council of Southern Women for the Prevention of Lynching, but declined writing, \u201cit has occurred to me that it would not be good strategy for me to make an address on the subject suggested at the Public Meeting to be held by your Council at [[Jackson, Mississippi|Jackson]] on May 27<sup>th</sup>.  The meeting would be construed as being opposed to anti-lynching legislation; whereas, to be effective it should be a meeting opposed to lynching. This suggestion is very important\u2026everything should indicate that you are trying to stop mob violence and that this is the whole purpose of the meeting.\u201d<ref>Personal letter to Mrs. L. W. Alford, Chairman of the Mississippi Council of Southern Women for the Prevention of Lynching, May 4, 1937, Dallas Historical Society, HWS Collection, D-75.8.</ref>\n\nOutraged, Sumners sent the Governor of Mississippi a telegram in reference to lynchings in 1937 which stated, \u201cif the press reports are even approximately correct, and they seem to be, these lynchings, both with regard to lynchers and the officers involved, were as dastardly a crime as cowardice could devise and brutality execute. It is the sort of thing which makes it hard for us who are trying to protect the governmental sovereignty of the states.  It will be effectively seized upon as a demonstration of the ability of states to govern. As one Southern man to another, I hope I will not be considered impertinent by stating candidly my own reaction and that is that the State of Mississippi cannot escape this reflection upon its governmental capacity, in fact cannot escape in effect becoming an accessory after the fact unless it is able to and does bring these lynchers and officers to speedy and adequate punishment\u201d<ref>Western Union Telegram to Honorable Hugh White, Governor of Mississippi, April 14, 1937, Dallas Historical Society, HWS Collection, D-97.6.</ref> Sumners called for justice against anyone involved in the now infamous lynching including the Sheriffs writing, \u201cthe turning over of a prisoner, regardless of the crime charged against him, for execution by some agency other than that provided by the laws of the country is a confession of unfitness to govern.\u201d<ref>Personal letter to Attorney General of Alabama, A.
