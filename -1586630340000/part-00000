Although he's claimed as a son by various families, a rich Duchess believes the true family Gaston belongs to is the Renauds. Gaston travels to the Renauds' estate alongside his lawyer, Huspar. A docile character, Gaston discovers his former identity of Jacques Renaud: a cruel and violent young man who used to kill animals for sport. He learns that immediately prior to the war he pushed his best friend, Marcel, down a flight of stairs, breaking his back, shortly after seeing him kiss the maid Juliette, with whom Jacques had been intimate. Gaston has difficulty reconciling his current personality with that of his past. His brother's wife, Valentine (with whom he had an affair during adolescence), tells him about a tiny scar on his shoulder, sustained when Valentine attacked him with a hat pin in a fit of jealousy. Gaston sees this scar in a mirror but doesn't tell Valentine about it. Soon thereafter, numerous families arrive at the Renaud estate, searching for their lost loved one from the war. Gaston spots a young boy. This boy, who is the only surviving member of the Madensales, a family who died in a boating accident when he was an infant, is searching for his long-lost nephew who happens to be much older than himself. Gaston tells the young boy about the scar on his shoulder and fabricates a story about the scar belonging to the boy's long-lost nephew. Gaston leaves the Renauds to become a member of the boy's family, later writing a letter to Jacques' brother Georges, stating that their Jacques is dead and they need not search for him any longer.\n\n==Inspiration and reception==\nInspired by the story of an amnesiac soldier, [[Anthelme Mangin]], who was claimed by over a dozen families,<ref>Jean Yves Le Naour, ''Le Soldat inconnu vivant'', 2002.</ref> the play was Anouilh's first major critical success and helped his career as a playwright flourish.\n\n==Original productions==\n\n'''Paris''' \u2013 Th\u00e9\u00e2tre des Mathurins, 16 February 1937\n\n*Gaston \u2013 [[Georges Pito\u00ebff]]\n*Georges Renaud \u2013 [[Louis Salou]]\n*Mme Renaud \u2013 [[Marthe Mellot]]\n*Valentine Renaud \u2013 Nadine Picard\n*La duchesse Dupont-Dufort \u2013 Nora Sylv\u00e8re\n*Ma\u00eetre Huspar \u2013 Raymond Dagand\n*Le petit gar\u00e7on \u2013 Ludmilla Pito\u00ebff\n*Ma\u00eetre Picwick \u2013 Henri Grall\n*Le ma\u00eetre d\u2019h\u00f4tel \u2013 Henri Gaultier\n*Le chauffeur \u2013 [[L\u00e9on Larive]]\n*Le valet de chambre \u2013 [[Gabriel Gobin]]\n* La cuisini\u00e8re \u2013 [[Andr\u00e9e Tainsy]]\n*Juliette \u2013 [[Madeleine Milhaud]]\n\nDirected by [[Georges Pito\u00ebff]]\n\n'''London''' \u2013 ''Traveller Without Luggage'' \u2013 Arts Theatre, 29 January 1959\n\n*Gaston \u2013 [[Denholm Elliott]]\n*Georges Renaud \u2013 [[Geoffrey Keen]]\n*Mme Renaud \u2013 [[Irene Browne]]\n*Valentine Renaud \u2013 [[Elizabeth Sellars]]\n*The Duchesse Dupont-Dufort \u2013 [[Joyce Carey]]\n*Ma\u00eetre Huspar \u2013 [[Douglas Wilmer]]\n*a small boy \u2013 Hugh James\n*Ma\u00eetre Picwick \u2013 Norman Pitt\n*A butler \u2013 Anthony Blake\n*A chauffeur \u2013 James Wellman\n*A valet \u2013 John Warner\n*A cook \u2013 [[Peggy Ann Clifford]]\n*Juliette \u2013 Violetta\n\nDirected by [[Peter Hall]]\n\nTranslated by [[John Whiting]]\n\n'''New York''' \u2013 ''Traveller Without Luggage'' \u2013 ANTA Playhouse, 17 September 1964\n\n*Gaston \u2013 [[Ben Gazzara]]\n*Georges Renaud \u2013 [[Stephen Elliott (actor)|Stephen Elliott]]\n*Mme Renaud \u2013 [[Mildred Dunnock]]\n*Valentine Renaud \u2013 [[Nancy Wickwire]]\n*The Duchesse Dupont-Dufort \u2013 Margaret Braidwood\n*Ma\u00eetre Huspar \u2013 Boris Tumarin\n*A small boy \u2013 Jeffrey Neal\n*Mr Truggle [ie, Ma\u00eetre Picwick] \u2013 Ronald Dawson\n*A butler \u2013 William Cottrell\n*A valet \u2013 Anthony Palmer\n*Juliette \u2013 [[Rae Allen]]\n\nDirected by [[Robert Lewis (actor)|Robert Lewis]]\n\nTranslated by [[Lucienne Hill]]\n\n==Adaptations==\nThe play has been adapted several times, firstly as [[Traveling Light (1944 film)|a film in 1944]], directed by Anouilh himself, and then several times on television: in Great Britain (October 1959 and February 1965), Australia (August 1961), Canada (January 1962), Spain (February 1964 and February 1968), and France (September 2004, directed by [[Pierre Boutron]]).
