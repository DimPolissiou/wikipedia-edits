One of the first patients is Lucy, the foster daughter of Annie, an old patient of Nic's; after Lucy's body temperature rises drastically during the surgery, Cain refuses to stop in order to impress some donors and the surgery succeeds after Nic resolves the complication. Mina, AJ and Dr. Torres treat Tyrone and Aaron who both require a heart transplant; due to Tyrone developing a temperature, Aaron gets the heart, leaving Tyrone with only a short time to live. However, Aaron suffers a catastrophic [[stroke]] that leaves him brain dead and Tyrone receives the heart; having previously hated Aaron, Tyrone gains a new appreciation for his roommate after learning just how much he actually meant to the young man. Bell continues promoting his supplement company, going on a talk show, but one of the [[organophosphate poisoning]] patients at another hospital dies and so nearly does one of Chastain's patients. Conrad and Devon investigate and with all signs pointing to the company, Bell decides to take responsibility out of remorse for putting so many people's lives in jeopardy. At the last minute, Conrad and Devon realize that the link is to an online clothing store and not Bell's company; Bell is later given the opportunity to expand his message to people through his own talk show after impressing the host with his honest approach.

Devon treats a famous stylist who turns out to have been eating her own hair, making him late to the ball where he is Nadine's escort. At the ball, Nadine's father announces that she must return home to assume her royal duties rather than continuing to remain in America like Nadine wants. Logan Kim's attempts to schmooze the king end badly, but Bell is able to use the situation to get Kim to stop Red Rock's plan to shut down Chastain's OBGYN department, suspected by Bell and Conrad to be to save costs due to the new neurosurgery center. The ball ends with the king's pregnant goddaughter collapsing and being rushed to Chastain where she gives birth to a baby with his heart outside of his chest; Mina and AJ are unsure if they can save the baby as the condition has a low survival rate.

While initially reluctant to accept, Bell is able to use their mutual love of Dolly to talk him into it; after the surgery, performed with the help of Ezra, now on a surgical rotation, Bell expresses hope that Joseph will be able to sing again.

Upon discovering that it has been six months, Cain chooses to finally remove the brain dead Dawn from life support as her statistics will no longer be tracked and to everyone the surgery will have been a success. Before Dawn's family allows her to die, Cain secretly orders tests to determine the source of her illness, circumventing Conrad and Devon. As Bell's new talk show grows more popular, he is removed from the surgical schedule by Logan Kim, but is called in by AJ to help save Bill Landry, the owner of Georgia FC, in a marathon surgery. Conrad and Nic help Kit Voss treat her son-in-law Derek who is discovered to have cancer with a fifty percent survival rate; despite chemotherapy complications, he makes it through the night thanks to his medical student wife.

Conrad figures it out on his own and Cain confesses to Ezra that as an intern he didn't speak up, costing four patients their lives before Red Rock and Ezra's mother intervened to save him; Ezra reluctantly helps Cain cover up the mistake with Sophia but comes clean after Sophia dies.

The hospital succeeds in containing the ''[[candida auris]]'' contamination and no one else tests positive. However, while Derek's recovery from his cancer finally shows success, he is blinded by the ''candida auris'' he got from Dawn Long's ventilator which is drug resistant; the treatment for Derek ends up requiring Cain's help at the same time that Justine needs him.

The 107 pledged delegates to the [[2020 Democratic National Convention]] will be allocated proportionally on the basis of the results of the primary. Of the 107 pledged delegates, between 3 and 4 are allocated to each of the state's 20 \"delegate districts\", each consisting of two [[New Jersey Legislative Districts, 2011 apportionment|legislative districts]], and another 14 are allocated to party leaders and elected officials (PLEO delegates), in addition to 23 at-large pledged delegates.

Should presidential candidates be entitled to more district delegates than delegate candidates presented, a special post-primary caucus at the state convention will be called on Wednesday, June 10, 2020 to designate the additional delegates.

Voter turnout was 72.1% in the presidential election, 72.0% in the Chamber elections and 77.7% in the Senate elections.<ref>Nohlen, pp191-232</ref>\n\n==Background==\nAfter living in self-imposed exile in his [[Rio Grande do Sul|Riograndense]] ranch between his overthrow in 1945 and 1950, former President [[Get\u00falio Vargas]], who had already been elected a senator in 1945, decided to run for the Presidency, as the candidate of the [[Brazilian Labour Party (historical)|Brazilian Labor Party]] (PTB), one of the two he founded after he decided to put an end to his 15-year dictatorship. Vargas, although in exile, remained active on the sidelines of Brazilian politics during the Presidency of his former War Minister, [[Eurico Gaspar Dutra]]. He notably criticized his successor's economic policies, taking a hard nationalist and populist tone which appealed to the base of the PTB, organized labour.\n\nIn April 1950, the [[Social Democratic Party (Brazil, 1945\u201365)|Social Democratic Party]], also pro-Vargas but based more around industrialists and state political machines, rejected the idea of forming a coalition with the PTB or the UDN and decided to run its own candidate. They nominated Cristiano Machado, a little-known congressman for [[Minas Gerais]].\n\nHowever, Vargas was able to forge an alliance with a number of PSD state leaders, notably in his own state of [[Rio Grande do Sul]] and in [[Rio de Janeiro]]. In [[Pernambuco]], he even forged an alliance with his traditional rivals, the UDN. This phenomenon - to nominate a candidate and support another - became known as \"cristianization\" in Brazil. In the state of [[S\u00e3o Paulo]], he forged an alliance with [[Adhemar de Barros]]' [[Social Progressive Party]] (PSP), a populist electoral machine who dominated state politics. The PSP was the only other party to officially endorse him, and provided him with his running-mate (who was separately elected), [[Jo\u00e3o Caf\u00e9 Filho]]. Vargas also assured himself of the support, or at least approval, of the military which had deposed him in 1945. He reconciled himself with the dominant figure of the military then, G\u00f3es Monteiro, who had played a role in his 1945 overthrow.<ref>Skidmore, TE: Politics in Brazil: 1930-1964, page 75. Oxford University Press, 2007.</ref>\n\nThe [[right-wing]] [[National Democratic Union (Brazil)|National Democratic Union]] (UDN), noted for its radical anti-Vargas posture, once again nominated [[Eduardo Gomes]] as its candidate. The party proved woefully unable to expand its narrow electoral base, and not even the anti-Vargas rhetoric of 1945 could deliver more votes. The UDN and Gomes also proved their little comprehension of the evolving Brazilian political scene by supporting abolishing the minimum wage instituted in Vargas' past administration.<ref>Skidmore, TE: Politics in Brazil: 1930-1964, page 77. Oxford University Press, 2007.</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Eurico Gaspar Dutra]] administration, the [[Brazilian Communist Party]] had its license revoked by the [[Supreme Electoral Court]] in the context of the early [[Cold War]]. Communists oriented their followers not to vote, but a significant share of them voted on Vargas.\n\n==Presidential candidates==\n*Former [[President of Brazil|President]] [[Get\u00falio Vargas]] of [[Rio Grande do Sul]] ([[Brazilian Labour Party (historical)|PTB]])\n*Former Air Minister [[Eduardo Gomes]] of [[Rio de Janeiro]] ([[National Democratic Union (Brazil)|UDN]])\n*[[Congress of Brazil|Congressman]] [[Cristiano Machado]] of [[Minas Gerais]] ([[Social Democratic Party (Brazil, 1945-65)|PSD]])\n*[[Jo\u00e3o Mangabeira]] ([[Brazilian Socialist Party|PSB]])\n\n==Results==\n===President===\nVargas won a convincing victory, with 48.7% of the vote and close to an absolute majority of votes cast. Despite the UDN's claim that he was not constitutionally elected (they claimed that a candidate needed an absolute majority of the votes), Vargas was inaugurated President in January 1951.<ref>Skidmore, TE: Politics in Brazil: 1930-1964, page 101.

handbook, Volume II'', p173 {{ISBN|978-0-19-928358-3}}</ref> The presidential elections were won by [[Get\u00falio Vargas]] of the [[Brazilian Labour Party (historical)|Brazilian Labour Party]], whilst the [[Social Democratic Party (Brazil, 1945\u201365)|Social Democratic Party]] remained the largest party in both the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate, although they lost their majority in the former. Voter turnout was 72.1% in the presidential election, 72.0% in the Chamber elections and 77.7% in the Senate elections.<ref>Nohlen, pp191-232</ref>\n\n==Background==\nAfter living in self-imposed exile in his [[Rio Grande do Sul|Riograndense]] ranch between his overthrow in 1945 and 1950, former President [[Get\u00falio Vargas]], who had already been elected a senator in 1945, decided to run for the Presidency, as the candidate of the [[Brazilian Labour Party (historical)|Brazilian Labor Party]] (PTB), one of the two he founded after he decided to put an end to his 15-year dictatorship. Vargas, although in exile, remained active on the sidelines of Brazilian politics during the Presidency of his former War Minister, [[Eurico Gaspar Dutra]]. He notably criticized his successor's economic policies, taking a hard nationalist and populist tone which appealed to the base of the PTB, organized labour.\n\nIn April 1950, the [[Social Democratic Party (Brazil, 1945\u201365)|Social Democratic Party]], also pro-Vargas but based more around industrialists and state political machines, rejected the idea of forming a coalition with the PTB or the UDN and decided to run its own candidate. They nominated Cristiano Machado, a little-known congressman for [[Minas Gerais]].\n\nHowever, Vargas was able to forge an alliance with a number of PSD state leaders, notably in his own state of [[Rio Grande do Sul]] and in [[Rio de Janeiro]]. In [[Pernambuco]], he even forged an alliance with his traditional rivals, the UDN. This phenomenon - to nominate a candidate and support another - became known as \"cristianization\" in Brazil. In the state of [[S\u00e3o Paulo]], he forged an alliance with [[Adhemar de Barros]]' [[Social Progressive Party]] (PSP), a populist electoral machine who dominated state politics. The PSP was the only other party to officially endorse him, and provided him with his running-mate (who was separately elected), [[Jo\u00e3o Caf\u00e9 Filho]]. Vargas also assured himself of the support, or at least approval, of the military which had deposed him in 1945. He reconciled himself with the dominant figure of the military then, G\u00f3es Monteiro, who had played a role in his 1945 overthrow.<ref>Skidmore, TE: Politics in Brazil: 1930-1964, page 75. Oxford University Press, 2007.</ref>\n\nThe [[right-wing]] [[National Democratic Union (Brazil)|National Democratic Union]] (UDN), noted for its radical anti-Vargas posture, once again nominated [[Eduardo Gomes]] as its candidate. The party proved woefully unable to expand its narrow electoral base, and not even the anti-Vargas rhetoric of 1945 could deliver more votes. The UDN and Gomes also proved their little comprehension of the evolving Brazilian political scene by supporting abolishing the minimum wage instituted in Vargas' past administration.<ref>Skidmore, TE: Politics in Brazil: 1930-1964, page 77. Oxford University Press, 2007.</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Eurico Gaspar Dutra]] administration, the [[Brazilian Communist Party]] had its license revoked by the [[Supreme Electoral Court]] in the context of the early [[Cold War]]. Communists oriented their followers not to vote, but a significant share of them voted on Vargas.\n\n==Presidential candidates==\n*Former [[President of Brazil|President]] [[Get\u00falio Vargas]] of [[Rio Grande do Sul]] ([[Brazilian Labour Party (historical)|PTB]])\n*Former Air Minister [[Eduardo Gomes]] of [[Rio de Janeiro]] ([[National Democratic Union (Brazil)|UDN]])\n*[[Congress of Brazil|Congressman]] [[Cristiano Machado]] of [[Minas Gerais]] ([[Social Democratic Party (Brazil, 1945-65)|PSD]])\n*[[Jo\u00e3o Mangabeira]] ([[Brazilian Socialist Party|PSB]])\n\n==Results==\n===President===\nVargas won a convincing victory, with 48.7% of the vote and close to an absolute majority of votes cast. Despite the UDN's claim that he was not constitutionally elected (they claimed that a candidate needed an absolute majority of the votes), Vargas was inaugurated President in January 1951.<ref>Skidmore, TE: Politics in Brazil: 1930-1964, page 101.

For example, he enjoys a symphony concert not so much for the music, but for the atmosphere: \"the lights danced before his eyes and the concert hall blazed into unimaginable splendor.\" Later on in the story, he steals money from where he works to support a short escapade in [[New York City]]. Once he exhausts his funds and his father catches wind of what has happened, he commits suicide rather than allow his father to take him back to Pittsburgh.\n\nPaul's teachers and father refer to Paul's \"case\", representing him at a distance and as an example of someone to be studied, handled, and managed; the term enables Cather to adopt \"the voice of medical authority.\" <ref name=WK>{{cite book|first= Wayne |last= Koestenbaum | title=The Queen's Throat: Opera, Homosexuality and the Mystery of Desire |publisher =Gay Men's Press | date=1994 |pages= 28\u201329|title-link= The Queen's Throat }}</ref>\n\n==Plot summary==\nThe short story \u201cPaul\u2019s Case\u201d is about a young man who struggles to fit in at home, school and in the world. At the start of the story, Paul is suspended from his high school in Pittsburgh for a week. He meets with his principal and teachers who complain about Paul's \"defiant manner\" in class and the \"physical aversion\" he exhibits toward his teachers. One of Paul's teachers also mentions that Paul's mother died back when he was a child in Colorado, which is later shown to be of importance. He then goes to work at [[Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh|Carnegie Hall]] in Pittsburgh. Here he works as an usher and can be himself by serving those in his section with grand enthusiasm. He stays for the concert and enjoys the social scene while losing himself in the music. After the concert, Paul follows the soloist and imagines life inside her hotel room. Unfortunately, the audience learns that Paul and his father have a poor relationship. Upon returning home very late one night, Paul enters through the basement to avoid a confrontation with his father. Paul's relationship with his father is one of abuse, so much so that while in the basement, Paul gets nervous that his father will come downstairs with a shotgun and kill him. Paul stays awake all night imagining what would happen if his father mistook him for a burglar and shot him, or if his dad would recognize him in time. Not only does Paul wonder if his father will recognize him in time, but he also entertains the idea of his father possibly regretting not shooting him when he had the chance to do so.   \n\nPaul despises the people on Cordelia street as they serve to remind him of his own lackluster life. Although his father considers him a role model for Paul, Paul is unimpressed by a plodding young man who works for an iron company and is married with four lovely children. While Paul longs to be wealthy, cultivated, and powerful, he lacks the stamina and ambition to attempt to change his condition. Instead, Paul escapes his monotonous life by visiting Charley Edwards, a young actor. Later on, Paul makes it clear to one of his teachers that his job ushering is more important than his schoolwork, causing his father to prevent him from continuing to work as an usher.\n\nPaul takes a train to New York City after stealing over $2000 from his new job at Denny & Carson's to finance a new life. He buys an expensive wardrobe, rents a room at the [[Waldorf-Astoria Hotel]], and walks around the city. He also meets a young boy from [[San Francisco]] who takes him on an all-night tour of the city's lively social scene. His few days of impersonating a rich, privileged young man, brought him more contentment than he had ever known because living a prosperous life is Paul's only hope and dream.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://english.fju.edu.tw/lctd/asp/works/51/study.htm#03|title=Paul's Case|website=english.fju.edu.tw|access-date=2016-11-17}}</ref> However, on the eighth day, after spending most of his money, Paul read from a Pittsburgh newspaper that his theft has been made public. His father has returned the money and is en route to New York City to bring Paul back home to Pittsburgh. Paul then reveals that he had bought a gun on his first day in New York City, and briefly considers shooting himself to avoid returning to his old life in Pittsburgh. Eventually, he decides against it and instead commits suicide by jumping in front of a train. Paul made the ultimate decision of taking his own life because the thought of returning to his old one was too much for him to handle.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Burke|first=Gerald T.|date=July 2003|title=The Willa Cather Electronic Archive2003395The Willa Cather Electronic Archive.

The \"whirling\" motions of said snowfall occur several times; as Paul gazes out of the train window on his way to New York, as well as consistently throughout the time he is actually in the city. It's almost as if we as readers are as much in a fantasy world as Paul is himself.

When Paul has a meeting with his instructors and the principal, he puts on a smile. The narrator notes that other boys would be more afraid than Paul was and would most likely have given in to an emotional and remorseful response about their disruptive behaviors.

Once he exhausts his funds and his father catches wind of what has happened, he commits suicide rather than allow his father to take him back to Pittsburgh.\n\nPaul's teachers and father refer to Paul's \"case\", representing him at a distance and as an example of someone to be studied, handled, and managed; the term enables Cather to adopt \"the voice of medical authority.\" <ref name=WK>{{cite book|first= Wayne |last= Koestenbaum | title=The Queen's Throat: Opera, Homosexuality and the Mystery of Desire |publisher =Gay Men's Press | date=1994 |pages= 28\u201329|title-link= The Queen's Throat }}</ref>\n\n==Plot summary==\nThe short story \u201cPaul\u2019s Case\u201d is about a young man who struggles to fit in at home, school and in the world. At the start of the story, Paul is suspended from his high school in Pittsburgh for a week. He meets with his principal and teachers who complain about Paul's \"defiant manner\" in class and the \"physical aversion\" he exhibits toward his teachers. One of Paul's teachers also mentions that Paul's mother died back when he was a child in Colorado, which is later shown to be of importance. He then goes to work at [[Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh|Carnegie Hall]] in Pittsburgh. Here he works as an usher and can be himself by serving those in his section with grand enthusiasm. He stays for the concert and enjoys the social scene while losing himself in the music. After the concert, Paul follows the soloist and imagines life inside her hotel room. Unfortunately, the audience learns that Paul and his father have a poor relationship. Upon returning home very late one night, Paul enters through the basement to avoid a confrontation with his father. Paul's relationship with his father is one of abuse, so much so that while in the basement, Paul gets nervous that his father will come downstairs with a shotgun and kill him. Paul stays awake all night imagining what would happen if his father mistook him for a burglar and shot him, or if his dad would recognize him in time. Not only does Paul wonder if his father will recognize him in time, but he also entertains the idea of his father possibly regretting not shooting him when he had the chance to do so.   \n\nPaul despises the people on Cordelia street as they serve to remind him of his own lackluster life. Although his father considers him a role model for Paul, Paul is unimpressed by a plodding young man who works for an iron company and is married with four lovely children. While Paul longs to be wealthy, cultivated, and powerful, he lacks the stamina and ambition to attempt to change his condition. Instead, Paul escapes his monotonous life by visiting Charley Edwards, a young actor. Later on, Paul makes it clear to one of his teachers that his job ushering is more important than his schoolwork, causing his father to prevent him from continuing to work as an usher.\n\nPaul takes a train to New York City after stealing over $2000 from his new job at Denny & Carson's to finance a new life. He buys an expensive wardrobe, rents a room at the [[Waldorf-Astoria Hotel]], and walks around the city. He also meets a young boy from [[San Francisco]] who takes him on an all-night tour of the city's lively social scene. His few days of impersonating a rich, privileged young man, brought him more contentment than he had ever known because living a prosperous life is Paul's only hope and dream.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://english.fju.edu.tw/lctd/asp/works/51/study.htm#03|title=Paul's Case|website=english.fju.edu.tw|access-date=2016-11-17}}</ref> However, on the eighth day, after spending most of his money, Paul read from a Pittsburgh newspaper that his theft has been made public. His father has returned the money and is en route to New York City to bring Paul back home to Pittsburgh. Paul then reveals that he had bought a gun on his first day in New York City, and briefly considers shooting himself to avoid returning to his old life in Pittsburgh. Eventually, he decides against it and instead commits suicide by jumping in front of a train. Paul made the ultimate decision of taking his own life because the thought of returning to his old one was too much for him to handle.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Burke|first=Gerald T.|date=July 2003|title=The Willa Cather Electronic Archive2003395The Willa Cather Electronic Archive.

It's almost as if we as readers are as much in a fantasy world as Paul is himself.

When Paul has a meeting with his instructors and the principal, he puts on a smile.

It is the capital city of the [[Iloilo province|province of Iloilo]] where it is geographically situated but, in terms of government and administration, it is politically independent. In addition, it is the center of the [[Metro Iloilo-Guimaras|Iloilo-Guimaras Metropolitan Area]], as well as the regional center and [[primate city]] of the [[Western Visayas]] region. In the {{PH wikidata|population_as_of}}, Iloilo City had a population of {{PH wikidata|population_total}} inhabitants, with a 1.02% population annual growth rate.{{PH census|2015}} For the metropolitan area, the total population is 946,146 inhabitants.\n\nIloilo City is bordered by the towns of [[Oton, Iloilo|Oton]] in the west, [[Pavia, Iloilo|Pavia]] in the north and [[Leganes, Iloilo|Leganes]] in the northeast. Just across the [[Iloilo Strait]] in its eastern and southern coastlines, are the towns of [[Buenavista, Guimaras|Buenavista]] and [[Jordan, Guimaras|Jordan]] in the island-province of [[Guimaras]].

Later during the revolution of the late 1800s, it was given the honorific title of \"La Muy Leay y Noble Ciudad\" (\"The Most Noble City\") by the Queen Regent of Spain Maria Christina due to the loyalty of the Ilonggos to the Spanish crown, the second city to received a royal title in the country during the Spanish colonial period after [[Manila City|Manila]]. Iloilo is one of the few ''Royal Spanish Cities in the Philippines or [[Spanish East Indies]]'' along with [[Naga, Camarines Sur|Naga]], [[Cebu City|Cebu]] and [[Manila City|Manila]]. At the turn of the 20th century, Iloilo City was second to the primate city of Manila, with stores along ''Calle Real'' (Iloilo's Escolta and old business district) selling luxury products from all over the world, an agricultural experimental station established at La Paz in 1888, a school of arts and trades which opened in 1891, and a telephone network system operating in 1894.\n\nIn the coming of the Americans also in the turn of the 20th century, Protestantism was brought by them and institutions like [[Central Philippine University]] (the first Baptist and second private American university in Asia and in the country); [[Jaro Evangelical Church]] (the first Baptist church in the country); [[Iloilo Mission Hospital]] (the first Protestant hospital in the country); Jaro Adventist Center (first organized Seventh-day Adventist church in the country); and the [[Convention of Philippine Baptist Churches]] (the oldest Baptist organizational body in the Philippines); where established.\n\nIloilo is last capital of [[Spanish East Indies|Spanish Empire]] in Asia and the Pacific before the Philippines was handed over to the [[United States]] in 1898 through the [[Treaty of Paris (1898)|Treaty of Paris]] (1898).\n\nThe city is the regional hub of education, healthcare, tourism, culture, industry and economy in [[Western Visayas]]. As one of the notable culinary capitals of the country, delectable foods that came principally where Iloilo is famous of are [[Pancit Molo]] \nand [[Batchoy|La Paz Batchoy]]. It is also the seat of Regional Center of National Government Offices, financial institutions and government-owned and controlled corporations. Recent economic boom and the city's aim for modern and sustainable development as a ''\"Smart City of the Future\"'' using the technology of Internet of things as a tool for efficient delivery of services such as transportation, safety, emergency response, environmental management, and heritage conservation, among others.<ref>https://andreaguanco.com/iloilo-a-future-smart-city-goozam/</ref> The city's continued efforts in building parks, open spaces and making the metropolis clean and conducive to tourists, bagged the city the ASEAN Clean Tourist City award in 2020.<ref>https://philnews.ph/2019/11/29/iloilo-city-won-the-asean-clean-tourist-city-award/</ref> \n\nIloilo City is one of the thriving Centers of Economy in the country - an adequate and growing number of banks establishing branches leads the metropolis with the most number of banks savings deposits and accounts in the Western Visayas region (third in the Philippines); the Iloilo International Airport (4th busiest airport in the country); and with  the on-going building construction boom especially in the real estate and retail sectors.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://vicilongo.weebly.com/|title=Research Center for Iloilo|website=Research Center for Iloilo}}</ref> Iloilo city has the lowest crime rate in entire Philippines,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.philstar.com/lifestyle/travel-and-tourism/2017/05/27/1704179/walk-through-iloilo-business-park|title=A walk through Iloilo Business Park|website=philstar.com}}</ref> lowest level of corruption, highest life expectancy in Visayas and Mindanao, huge concentration of middle class and rank 1 in happiness index,<ref>{{cite news | url=https://ph.news.yahoo.com/ilonggos-enjoyment-life-rates-high-nscb-hdi-ranking-095219255.html | title=Ilonggos' Enjoyment Of Life Rates High In NSCB's HDI Ranking | date=2 February 2013 | work=Manila Bulletin | via=Yahoo | accessdate=14 August 2019 }}</ref> and the most business-friendly city<ref>https://www.bomboradyo.com/iloilo/iloilo-city-ginpasidunggan-nga-2019-most-business-friendly-lgu-award/</ref>\n\n== History ==\n{{See also|History of the Philippines|Irong-Irong}}\n\n=== [[Kadatuan]] [[Srivijaya]] ===\n\n{{see also | Maragtas |Greater India | Indosphere | Chola invasion of Srivijaya}}\nAccording to Spanish written accounts, the inhabitants of Panay island were hailed from [[Borneo]], [[Sulawesi]], and [[Sumatra]]. Panay might be named after the kingdom of [[Pannai]] which is located in Sumatra, since i and y are interchangeable in Spanish. Proof for this is corroborated by linguistic evidence such as [[Talang Tuo inscription]] where many Old Malayan words during [[Srivijayan]] survived in modern Ilongo Language. The [[Srivijayan]] City states of Sumatra was ruled by an Indian King [[Mah\u0101r\u0101ja]] with their [[Datuk|Datu]] , a lesser vassal Malayan chieftain.<ref>Kota Kapur inscription mentioned \"manraksa yan kadatuan \u00e7rivijaya\"</ref>\n\n=== Period of Malay Mass Migration ===\n{{see also | Greater India | Indosphere | Chola invasion of Srivijaya}}\n\nCruel rule of a certain Rajah Makatunao, the [[Maragtas|ten Bornean datus]] sailed to the island which they named [[Panay]], Pani or Panae (shortened word for Ananipay) as part of Visayan Empire. The Malayan Datus offered a golden hat ([[salakot]]) and a long pearl necklace called ''Manangyad'' in the [[Hiligaynon language]] (meaning a long necklace that touches or \"nagasangyad\" the ground) as a [[barter]] to the [[Ati people|Ati]] to allow them entry and habitation of the island. The Datus founded the [[Kadatuan]] [[Srivijaya]] consisted of several settlements called wanua/Benua/Banwa as corroborated by [[Kota Kapur inscription]].\n\nSome historians also affirm the Sumatran origin of the people of Panay, observing that the [[Visayans]] derived their [[Indosphere|writing system]] from those of [[Toba Batak people|Toba]], Borneo, Celebes, Ancient Java and from the [[Edicts of Ashoka|Edicts of the ancient Indian]] emperor [[Ashoka]].<ref name=\"auto4\">{{cite web|url=http://archive.org/details/lasislasvisayase00reye|title=Las islas Visayas en la epoca de la conquista|first=Isabelo de los|last=Reyes y Florentino|date=15 October 1889|publisher=Manila : Tipo-litografia de Chofre y ca.|via=Internet Archive}}</ref>\n\nThe very probable proof of Sumatran origin of the Malay settlement in Panay is the account of P. Francisco Colin, S.J, a historian who came to Asia during the early years of the Spanish conquest of the Philippines. The following is his personal observation recorded during his visit to Sumatra:\n\n{{quote|\"In the middle of Sumatra, there is a spacious and extensive lake (presumably [[Lake Toba]] near [[Pannai]]), around the shore of which many and several ethnic groups settle [and] from where, in the past, there was a forced exodus of inhabitants [constraining them] to sail to and to settle in various islands. One of these ethnic groups was subjugated there and they were unable to flee for various circumstances. Someone speaking Pampango (which I heard before) found out that they were not speaking Pampango among themselves, but they (the Malays of Sumatra) donned the old Pampango ethnic costume. And when he addressed an old man among them, the [old man] replied: ''You are descendants of the lost, that in times past left this place to settle in other lands, and nothing was heard about them again.''\"}}\n\nSo, Colin concluded that the Tagalogs and Pampangos, and other political or ethnic groups (Visayans and other related civilized groups), by symbols used in expressing language, by color of dress and costume, one can believe that these came from parts of Borneo and Sumatra.<ref name=\"auto4\"/> The phrase \"subjugated ethnic groups\" gives hint to the encroaching of the Majapahit Empire into the falling [[Srivijaya]] Empire, or perhaps to the Islamization of [[Sumatra]], forcing the inhabitants to look for safer territories where they could preserve their freedom and culture. This resonates with the local Panay tradition regarding the arrival of ten [[Datu]]s from Borneo.\n\nThe kingdom of Pannai was a militant-nation allied under the Srivijaya [[Mandala (Southeast Asian political model)|Mandala]] that defended the conflict-ridden [[Strait of Malacca]], the world's busiest maritime choke-point.\n\nThe Visayan lore says that in the 13th century, [[Maragtas|ten Bornean datus]] came to the island which they named Panay, Pani or Panae (after the fallen kingdom of Pannai or a shortening of the Ati word for the island, Ananipay). This, after they dissented from the unjust rule of a certain Rajah Makatunao and exiled themselves. Upon arriving on the island of [[Panay]], they gave a golden hat ([[salakot]]) and a long pearl necklace called ''Manangyad'' in the [[Hiligaynon language]] (meaning a long necklace that touches or \"nagasangyad\" the ground) as a peace offering and treaty-items to the [[Ati people|Ati]] natives of the island. It was said that it was also a way of the ten Bornean datus to barter the flat lands of Panay from the Ati. One datu, named Paiburong, was given the territory of Irong-Irong (cf. also Kedatuan of Madja-as).<ref name=\"ilongo.weebly.com\">{{cite web|url=http://ilongo.weebly.com/iloilo-history-part-1.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304201139/http://ilongo.weebly.com/iloilo-history-part-1.html|url-status=dead|title=Iloilo History Part 1 - Research Center for Iloilo<!-- Bot generated title -->|archivedate=4 March 2016}}</ref><ref name=Lopez>{{cite book |title=Iloilo: A Rich and Noble Land |author=Lopez Group Foundation |year=2008 |publisher=Benpres Publishing |location=Pasig City, Philippines |isbn=978-971-93904-0-4 |page=278 }}</ref> The noble people of Panay (and thus Iloilo City) claim descent from these idealistic rebel royals and their few faithful and loyal soldiers who chose to abandon a wealthy but oppressed life under a foreign empire in Sumatra and Borneo and instead, build a state that was truer to their ideals in Panay island.

Because of this, Iloilo's industry and agriculture was put on direct access to foreign markets. But what triggered the economic boom of Iloilo in the 19th century was the development of the sugar industry in Iloilo and its neighboring island of Negros. Sugar during the 19th century was of high demand. [[Nicholas Loney]], the British vice-consul in Iloilo, developed the industry by giving loans, constructing warehouses in the port, and introducing new technologies in sugar farming. The rich families of Iloilo developed large areas of [[Negros (Philippines)|Negros]], which were later called haciendas, because of sugar's high demand in the world market. Because of the increase in commercial activity, infrastructures, recreational facilities, educational institutions, banks, foreign consulates, commercial firms and much more sprouted in Iloilo.\n\nOn 5 October 1889, due to the economic development that was happening in Iloilo making it the most important port in the Philippine Islands next to Manila,<ref>Manila was occupied by Miguel Lopez de Salcedo as the colonial capital of the Archipelago on 24 June 1571, establishing it as the metropolis of ''Nueva Castilla'' (the name he gave to the Island of Luzon).

Another [[Decree|royal cedula]] was issued by the Spanish Monarch granting Manila the title of ''Noble y siempre leal'' (Noble and ever loyal).

Threats of mutiny, sacking and burning of the City, forced the Generals to collect money from the towns of Panay in order to appease the Visayan contingents. The same thing happened to the Tagalog component of the troops. The danger of riots in the City and the attitude of native soldiers fomented fear among the inhabitants. Chinese merchants closed their stores leaving only a small hole for transacting business. Many prominent families, who were in constant fear for their safety, went over to Negros Island in small schooners that flew the Philippine flag, without having any trouble with the American ships on standby in the waters between the two islands.<ref name=\"John, Foreman 1907, p. 513\"/>\n\nOn 10 February, an Extraordinary Session at the City Hall discussed plans for the impending bombardment of the City. There was a proposal to burn Iloilo, but the Mayor protested to this barbarous plan. A majority in the meeting was in favor of burning, which was seen as an invitation to despoil, lay waste and slay. The instigators who had no property interests in Iloilo, but who were so jealous of those who have, found a ready response of the Tagalog mercenaries, who had no local attachment to the City.<ref name=\"John, Foreman 1907, p. 515\">John, Foreman, ''The Philippine Islands : a political, geographical, ethnographical, social and commercial history of the Philippine Archipelago, embracing the whole period of Spanish rule, with an account of the succeeding American insular government'', New York: 1907, C.

In the meantime, from early morning, the withdrawing native soldiers, followed by a riffraff mob, were observed to have rushed hither and thither, throwing firebrands on to petroleum-washed houses. The Chinese had to barricade themselves to no use since fire burned their bazaars. Europeans and the Spanish half-castes had to defend themselves with every means possible, including bribing the rioters with a few pesos. Two British warships in the roadstead sent boats ashore and landed a party of marines, who made a gallant effort to save foreign properties,<ref name=\"John, Foreman 1907, p. 515\"/> as the United Kingdom had a strong business interest in Iloilo and a Consulate.\n\nBy 1 o'clock of the same day, the Americans made a landing and restored order. Sentinels were stationed to protect what still remained of the townspeople's goods. In due course, indemnity claims were forwarded to the American military authorities, but were all rejected.<ref>John, Foreman, ''The Philippine Islands : a political, geographical, ethnographical, social and commercial history of the Philippine Archipelago, embracing the whole period of Spanish rule, with an account of the succeeding American insular government'', New York: 1907, C.

That event was the cause of the ruin of such a beautiful city, second only to Manila, where, if there was not a surplus of money, neither the people's welfare was wanting, and life was prosperous and peaceful.

They continued to meet resistance from the Ilonggos, which lasted up to 1901. In which case, Iloilo was also among the last cities to fall to Americans.<ref name=Lopez/> Many leaders surrendered to the new regime and were reintegrated to the Ilonggo society without conditions. Among them was General Martin Delgado, who accepted the position of Governor of the Province of Iloilo from 1901 to 1904, under the American flag. He was, at that time, the highest paid Governor in the whole Archipelago, receiving $3,000 gold annually.<ref>''The San Francisco Call'', 12 April 1901, p. 2.</ref>\n\nLocal government was established in some towns of Iloilo by 11 April 1901. Jose Maria Gay was appointed Alcalde, Matias Hibiernas was teniente alcalde of Iloilo;Jose Yusay was President of Molo; Pablo Borromeo was President of Arevalo; Ruperto Montinola was the lone representative of Jaro, but was not its President; Madurriao's President was Emigdio Mesa. Emilio Magbanua was appointed its police delegate. It was observed by Juan de Leon, judge of the Court of First Instance that there existed a rivalry between the pueblos of Iloilo, Jaro and Molo, which are adjacent to and are only half an hour travel by carriage from each other. Besides, Molo and Jaro are residential pueblos, and Iloilo was the business town for both. It was also recommended that Arevalo be joined to Molo, and La Paz to Jaro.

Visayans of position, with property interests at stake, were convinced that absolute independence without any control or protection from some established political power was premature and doomed to disaster. The Visayan grudge against the Tagalog predominance was also a factor that contributed to the failure of Aguinaldo's government.

These bishops sustained the educational achievements of the Spanish friars by bringing in American and European Catholic missionaries, among whom were the [[Sisters of Charity of St. Paul]], and [[Augustinians|Augustinian missionary priests]]. The Augustinians, who were the first to bring the Christian faith in the Philippines as well as in Panay island, and who built the centuries-old heritage churches in this island,<ref>Cf. Fr.

During the American regime, their confreres from the United States developed evermore this institution, which later became the first university in Iloilo. The American Catholic Bishops also maintained and upgraded the [[St. Vincent Ferrer Seminary]] (established in 1869 as the Collegio-Seminario de San Vicente Ferrer), which was the first institution of higher learning in Western Visayas. Despite the Augustinians being Catholics and Baptists being Protestants, they mutually enriched each other through dialogue mainly because Augustinian ideals were the foundations of Protestantism since the first Protestant was [[Martin Luther]] and he was a former Augustinian priest himself and the Protestant zeal for reformation from corruption even started some reform in the church itself. [[Saint Ezekiel Moreno]] who was ordained in the Minor Orders in Jaro, Iloilo had walked the fine line between reform, obedience and leadership since he ministered and walked hand in hand with condemned rebels and criminals in the [[Iwahig Prison and Penal Farm]], he was also obedient to his superiors in the [[Order of Augustinian Recollects]], a reform or \"Recollection\" movement in the Augustinian Order, which took elements from the Protestant Reformation. Saint Ezekiel Moreno also became the leader of a political movement when he became a Bishop of [[Pasto, Colombia]].<ref>http://www.lablaa.org/blaavirtual/revistas/credencial/octubre1993/octubre2.htm</ref> The visitation of Saint Ezekiel Moreno is a harmonized incarnation of the ancient [[Conviv\u00e8ncia]] in Spain when different religions and kingdoms; Pagan, Christian, Jewish and Muslim lived side by side and struggled to maintain their perspective purity, contested with each other and yet also mutually enriched each other without turning into a mongrelized melting pot of a mixed up and confused morass. Coincidentally, Saint Ezekiel Moreno was ordained in the Minor Orders in the then church of Jaro which housed a Virgin Mary statue under the Title of \"[[Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de la Candelaria de Jaro]]\". An image with complex Conviv\u00e8ncia alluding properties due to the confluence of many symbols from various cultures simultaneously present in the image but it is likely not earthly of nature and is a pure grace direct from heaven or an image \"Not carved by human hands\" due to its miraculous nature which was found floating in a river, shifting in weight and growing in size.\n\n[[File:The National geographic magazine (Page 494) BHL40563491.jpg|thumb|left|A market in Iloilo, in the 1910s]]\nThe Paulinian Sisters took charge of St. Paul Hospital, originally owned by the Catholic Diocese of Jaro.

La Paz was re-established as a separate municipality in 1920. In 1937, the town of Iloilo was amalgamated with the towns of La Paz and Ar\u00e9valo as one [[chartered city]].

===\n\n{{main|Hiligaynon language}}\n[[Hiligaynon language|Hiligaynon]] is the dominant language of Iloilo City.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://vicilongo.weebly.com/language.html|title=Language|website=Research Center for Iloilo}}</ref> [[Philippine English|English]] is used as the language of business and education. In addition, other local languages such as [[Karay-a language|Karay-a]] (also known as Kinaray-a or obsolete Haraya) is also spoken. [[Spanish language in the Philippines|Spanish]], once widely spoken during the colonial era up to the 1980s, is dying out, though a broken Spanish creole is spoken by a few of some Spanish-blood families and elderly sugar barons.\n\nHiligaynon is spoken in Panay, Guimaras and Negros islands, and is part of the [[Visayan language family]] of the [[Malayo-Polynesian languages]]. Because Iloilo was a former Spanish colony for 300 years, Hiligaynon is heavily influenced by the Spanish language with a plethora of loaned words ''(Guerra, Puerta, Golpe, Aguanta, Puerto, Calle, and Edificio, among others)''. Hiligaynon is mainly concentrated in the provinces of Iloilo, Guimaras and Negros Occidental. The language is referred to as \"Ilonggo\" ({{lang-es|Ilongo/Ylongo}}) in Iloilo and Negros Occidental. More precisely, \"Ilonggo\" is the ethno-linguistic group referring to the inhabitants of Iloilo and the culture associated with native Hiligaynon speakers. The distinction between the terms, Ilonggo and Hiligaynon, is unclear however, as most of the townspeople are claiming that Hiligaynon is the language being spoken and Ilonggo is a term used to refer a person living in Iloilo or its associated culture and ethnicity.\n\n=== Religion ===\n\n[[File:Jaro Cathedral (Catedral de Jaro).jpg|thumb|left|[[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Jaro|Jaro Cathedral]] ''([[Jaro Cathedral|Catedral de Jaro/Catedral Metropolitana de Jaro]]) or National Shrine of Our Lady of Candles'' which is the seat of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Jaro]] is one of the largest Roman Catholic Archdioceses in the Philippines. The present Archdiocese of [[Capiz province|Capiz]], the islands of [[Palawan]] and [[Mindoro]] and [[Zamboanga Peninsula|Zamboanga]] were former parts of its ecclesiastical jurisdiction before they became a separate bishopric.\n\nAs the second National Shrine in the Visayas (first in Western Visayas and first Marian dedicated church to do so outside Luzon), Jaro Cathedral is likewise widely known as the seat of Roman Catholicism in Western Visayas.]]\n\n[[File:Bishop Jose Romeo O. Lazo (2).jpg|thumb|160px|[[Jose Romeo O. Lazo]], the incumbent Roman Catholic Archbishop of Jaro.]]\n\nIloilo City is one of the notable centers of faith in the Philippines. Due to the heavy Spanish Missions, the city's population is predominant Catholic with over 95% belonging to the Roman Catholic Church. Other religious minorities such as [[Protestant]]s (5%), Iglesia NI Cristo(2%) and Aglipayans (1%) (also a form of Episcopal [[Protestantism]]) have a significant presence at the city.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://psa.gov.ph/sites/default/files/attachments/hsd/specialrelease/Iloilo%20City_Statistical%20Tables.xls |title=Statistics |website=psa.gov.ph |access-date=2019-10-15}}</ref>\n\nThe former city of [[Jaro, Iloilo City|Jaro]] (one of the present districts (boroughs) of Iloilo city) is the seat of bishopric and pioneer Christian institutions not only in Western Visayas but in the whole Philippines established through the Spanish colonization. The Spaniards which brought the Catholic faith established the [[Roman Catholic]] metropolitan see of the [[Archdiocese of Jaro]] with its diocesan cathedral while the Americans which brought the Protestantism established the Convention of Philippine Baptist Churches (the first and oldest Baptist churches organization in the Philippines), the [[Jaro Evangelical Church]] (the first Baptist church in the Philippine islands), and Jaro Adventist Center (first organized Adventist church in the Philippines).\n\nThe Roman Catholic Archdiocese is one of the oldest and largest bishopric sees in the country. It was established as a parish in 1587 initially covering Catmon, Cabatuan and Maasin . It was created a diocese by virtue of a papal bull of Pope Pius IX on 27 May 1865 . It has jurisdiction over sufragan bishops of [[Mindoro]], [[Palawan]], [[Zamboanga Peninsula|Zamboanga]], the provinces of [[Iloilo]] , [[Guimaras]], [[San Jose de Buenavista]] , [[Capiz]], [[Bacolod]], San Carlos and [[Kabankalan]] in Negros Occidental.\n\nIt lost some of its territory to establish the Diocese of Zamboanga and Apostolic Prefecture of Palawan. Much later, three other ecclesiastical jurisdictions were established from parts of its territory: Diocese of Bacolod (15 July 1932), Apostolic Prefecture of Mindoro (2 July 1936), and Diocese of Capiz (27 January 1951). The diocese was elevated into a Metropolitan Archdiocese by Pope Pius XII. Later, on 24 March 1962, it lost further some of its territory that resulted to the establishment the Territorial Prelature of San Jose de Antique (but still a part of it at present).\n\n[[File:Jaro Evangelical Church.jpg|thumb|upright|right|[[Jaro Evangelical Church]], the first Baptist Church in the Philippines (second Protestant Church in the Philippines and first Protestant Church outside Manila in the Philippines both after the [[Central United Methodist Church (Manila)]] (1899)) by the Northern American Baptists.]]\n\nThe Jaro Cathedral (National Shrine of the Our Lady of Candles) is the seat of the Archdiocese of Jaro. Saint Elizabeth of Hungary and the Our Lady of Candles are the official Catholic patronesses of the Archdiocese. The Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de la Candelaria or Our Lady of the Candles is the official patron of the whole Western Visayas and Romblon. Its image or statue perched atop the facade of the cathedral is ''the first and only Marian image crowned by a Pope and saint ([[Pope John Paul II]]) in the Philippines and Asia''.\n\nBeing designated as a National Shrine, Jaro Cathedral is likewise widely known as the seat of Roman Catholicism in Western Visayas. The said designation (National Shrine) by the Catholic Bishops Conference of the Philippines is the first of its kind in the region, the second in Western Visayas (after Cebu), and the first Marian dedicated church outside of Luzon.\n\n[[Protestantism]] forms as the second largest faith in the City of Iloilo. Protestant sects was brought by the [[United States|American]]s when the [[Philippines]] was ceded to the [[United States|American]] rule by [[Spain]] through the 1898 Treaty of Paris.\n\nThe said faith brought by the [[United States]] in the heavily Roman Catholic Iloilo has gained adherents and still continues to grow at present. Iloilo which is one of the pioneering places in the country that Protestants set foot is strongly contributed due to its economic importance in the international scene in the early 1900s. The American colonial government tolerated religious freedom that even to this day Iloilo is still a predominantly Catholic.\n\n[[Presbyterian]]s and [[Baptist]]s are among the first Protestant sects that arrived in Iloilo. The arrival of American brand of Protestant denominations resulted to the establishment of notable pioneering institutions in Iloilo. The [[Presbyterian]]s established the [[Iloilo Mission Hospital]] in 1901 (the first American and Protestant hospital in the Philippines) while [[Baptist]]s established the American [[John D. Rockefeller]] funded [[Central Philippine University]] in 1905 (the first Baptist and second American university in the Philippines and in Asia), [[Jaro Evangelical Church]] in 1900 (the first Baptist church in the Philippines and also the first Protestant church outside Manila (2nd in the Philippines after the [[Central United Methodist Church (Manila)|Central United Methodist Church]] in Manila), and the [[Convention of Philippine Baptist Churches]] (the first and oldest Baptist churches organization in the Philippines).\n\nThe [[Seventh-day Adventist]]s did not join the comity agreement for early Protestant sects for jurisdictional missions who came to the Philippines especially in Iloilo because they wanted to go any parts of the country. They arrived years later following the advent of Protestant missions in the Philippines in the early 1900s in Iloilo. Their arrival resulted to the founding of ''Jaro Adventist Center'', the first organized Seventh-day Adventist church in the Philippines.\n\nThere are other Christian sects such as [[Iglesia ni Cristo]] and [[Church of Christ (Latter Day Saints)|Church of Christ of Latter Day Saints]] or Mormon and communities of non-Christian sects like [[Islam]] which brought by Muslim-Filipinos from the south, [[Sikhism]] by the Indian immigrants, and [[Taoism]] and [[Buddhism]] which brought by [[Chinese people|Chinese]] immigrants.\n\n== Economy ==\n{{wide image|Downtown Iloilo City Panorama.jpg|850px|align-cap=center|Panoramic view of Iloilo City's downtown area}}\n\nIloilo City is a hub for trade, commerce, finance, technology, medical tourism, hospitality, real estate, tourism, education, and industry in the [[Western Visayas]] region.

Present modern developments spread out outside the city in neighboring towns that are a part of Metropolitan Iloilo.\n\n===Architecture===\n[[File:Lopez_Heritage_House_clode.jpg|thumb|220px|right|Nelly's Garden or Lopez Mansion ''(Mansion de Lopez)'' in Jaro is regaled as the ''\"Queen of all Heritage Houses in Western Visayas\"''.]]\n\nIloilo City's urban planning and architecture reflect the plans of the Spanish and the American colonial administrations. Since Iloilo City is a conglomeration of towns, the districts have their own plazas which are surrounded by establishments of political and ecclesiastical influence, such as churches and old administrative halls. In 1930, [[Juan M. Arellano]] of the Bureau of Public Works designed the schematic plan for Iloilo City, which was influenced by [[Ebenezer Howard]]'s \"Garden City.\"<ref name=heritage>{{Citation | author = Iloilo City Cultural Heritage Conservation Council | title = Republic of the Philippines Iloilo City Conservation Planning and Development Guidelines for the Downtown Central Business District (CBD)Heritage Zone | url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/33612277/Conservation-Planning-and-Development-Guidelines-for-the-Downtown-Central-Business-District-CBD-Heritage-Zone | pages = 16\u201317 | accessdate = 4 November 2010 }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Villa Lizares (Lizares Mansion).jpg|thumb|220px|left|The [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux-Arts]] Villa Lizares (Lizares Mansion) in the town of Jaro.]]\n\nThe [[Spanish culture|Spanish]] colonial influence is strongly imprinted not only in Iloilo's history and cultural background but also the architectural perspective.\n\nThe city's regaled status during the Spanish colonial era until the turn of the 20th century is implied during by the sugar boom with ubiquitous stately mansions and edifices built by the old money Ilonggo Sugar Baron and elite families which contrast to the city's economic importance as a second city next to Manila during the said era in the Philippines.  The city's other moniker \u2013 \u2018\u2019City of Mansions\u2019\u2019  is likewise implied because Iloilo holds 240 mansions in which 30 of it are grand mansions built during the Spanish and American colonial eras.\n\n[[File:Campanario_de_Jaro_(Jaro_Belfry).jpg|thumb|200px|right|Campanario de Jaro (Jaro Belfry), one of the few free standing bell towers in the Philippines that is detached from the church.]]\n\nThe ravaged \u2018\u2019Fuerte de San Pedro\u2019\u2019 (Fort San Pedro) is Iloilo\u2019s ground zero as there was no Iloilo City back in the 1600s. As a fortress, Fort San Pedro was built solely by the Spaniards to protect Iloilo from the marauding pirates and privateers. The fort is the second Spanish built fort after the one in Cebu (also Fort San Pedro) in the Philippines and Asia. The foundation of the Fort San Pedro was substantial to the Spanish Empire\u2019s stronghold as Panay Island with Iloilo as their second colonial center established through the Iloilo precursor towns of [[Oton, Iloilo|Oton]] (1566) and [[Arevalo, Iloilo City|La Villa Rica de Arevalo]] (1581). Oton which was founded as early as 1566 but formally established in 1572 was the actual second seat of Spanish colonial powers but due to pirate attacks, they moved the capital eastward and established the \u2018\u2019La Villa Rica de Arevalo\u2019\u2019.\n\nThe town of La Villa Rica de Arevalo holds some of the fine example of Spanish built mansions like the mansion of the Spanish Governor General, but were destroyed when the pirates ransacked and destroyed the town. It was in the said frequent events of pirate attacks that the Spaniards moved finally the capital further eastward in the mouth of \u2018\u2019Rio de Iloilo\u2019\u2019 (Iloilo River) which is flanked and protected by [[Guimaras Island]] across it.\n\n[[File:Casa de Emperador (Iloilo Museum of Contemporary Art).jpg|thumb|left|220px|Casa de Emperador in [[Iloilo Business Park]], an example of modern built classical styled edifice.]]\n\nIt was in the said establishment of the city on the mouth of Iloilo River that as years go by, the city flourished to its heights especially in the economic and regal importance in the Spanish and American eras. La Villa Rica de Arevalo (Arevalo) is the first Spanish named town in the Philippine islands. It is also in Arevalo that the third oldest image of Holy Child Jesus (Se\u00f1or Santo Ni\u00f1o) in the Philippines was brought by the Spaniards. Notable present day structures that are repositories that attest to the town's former glory as a Spanish precursor town of Iloilo is the mansion of Balay Cami\u00f1a na Bato and the Convento de Arevalo.\n\nDuring the Spanish and American eras, the city developed its own unique charm that exudes a typical European city in the east which differed it from other cities just like the old Manila in the Philippines. It was in the said eras that architectural perspective of Iloilo flourished with European styled edifices and stately mansions was built which stands of Iloilo's once economic and political importance in its heyday.\n\n[[File:Aduana de Iloilo - Iloilo Customs House.jpg|thumb|right|220px|''Aduana de Iloilo'' (Iloilo Customs House) with the ''Muelle Loney'' (Loney Dock) which was used as a wharf and port of call berthing ships that plied international routes when the ''[[Port of Iloilo|Puerto de Iloilo]]'' ([[Port of Iloilo]]) was opened to the world market on 29 September 1855 by [[Queen Isabella II of Spain]].]]\n\n[[Calle Real, Iloilo|Calle Real]] (Spanish for Royal Street) which stretches from Plazoleta Gay up to Plaza Alfonso XII (Plaza Libertad) is Iloilo's Escolta (a heritage street in Manila) lined with commercial edifices that possesses European designs. Calle Real is Iloilo's old Central Business District and is considered as the second most preserved heritage business district in the Philippines. The street during the Iloilo's economic heyday during the late 19th and early 20th centuries when the \u2018\u2019Puerto de Iloilo\u2019\u2019 (Port of Iloilo) was opened to the international trade is a melting pot and common ground for people of different walks of life, race and color. Stores back then in Calle Real sells luxury goods and items from all over the world.\n\nIloilo also possesses structures built during the prelude of the American colonial period in the Philippines. ''Aduana de Iloilo'' (Iloilo Customs House) and old Iloilo City Hall are notable of the structures built during the said colonial period. Iloilo Customs House, the second largest customs house after the Aduana in Manila was built the Filipino Architect [[Juan M. Arellano]].\n\nIn farther north is the town of [[Jaro, Iloilo City|Jaro]], the largest of all the district of the City of Iloilo. Once a separate city before it merged with the City of Iloilo in the 1940s, is considered as a town of piousness, old rich and grandeur. Many notable Spanish Ilonggos settled and the said area and built their grand mansions and villas. The town\u2019s architecture is heavily influenced by the Hispanic and American cultures.\n\n[[File:St. Anne Parish (Molo Church).jpg|thumb|left|Iglesia de Molo (St. Anne Parish), the first Gothic and feminist church outside Manila.]]\n\nGrand mansions with imposing European styled facades and motifs of ''\u2018\u2019Buena Familias\u2019\u2019'' or ''\"Old-rich families\"'' (Spanish-Chinese-Filipino families) of Jaro like the Lopez, Ledesma, Lizares, Jalandoni, Javellana and Locsin families that some of it lines the first millionaire row in the Philippine islands still stands to this day. Two of notable mansions that attest to Jaro\u2019s importance as an old rich town that developed out of the sugar boom during the Spanish colonial period is the Mansion de Lopez (Lopez Mansion) or Nelly Garden and the beaux-art styled Villa Lizares (Lizares Mansion) which houses at present the Angelicum School Iloilo of the Dominicans.\n\nReligion is also a crucial factor that influenced Jaro\u2019s architectural and town plan perspective as it is the cradle of Christian faith in [[Western Visayas]]. The Spanish which brought the Roman Catholic faith established the [[Jaro Cathedral]] (National Shrine of the Our Lady Candles) with its separate belfry located across it (one of the few churches in the Philippines with a detached belfry) and the [[St. Vincent Ferrer Seminary|Seminario-Colegio de San Vicente Ferrer]] (the first institution of Higher Learning in Western Visayas). The advent of American colonialization which brought Protestantism has resulted also to the establishment of institutions.\n\n[[File:Festive Walk Parade (Phase 2).jpg|thumb|''Torre del Reloj'' (The Clock Tower) of Festive Walk Parade at [[Iloilo Business Park]]. Its construction is a result of the economic boom of the City of Iloilo since 2010.]]\n\nFine examples of institutions with edifices possessing American architecture and influence includes the [[Central Philippine University]] by the Protestant Baptists in 1905 which holds century old American colonial styled edifices, the [[Convention of Philippine Baptist Churches]] which housed at the European styled former (Rupert) Montinola Mansion in Fajardo, Jaro, and the [[Jaro Evangelical Church]] (the first Baptist Church in the Philippine Islands), are among the few of the notable institutions that holds a number of structures that possesses American architectural influence design.\n\nThe town of [[Molo, Iloilo City|Molo]] located westward of the \u2018\u2019La Punta\u2019\u2019 (City Proper) is sometimes called \u2018\u2019Parian\u2019\u2019 or Chinese town during the [[Spanish people|Spanish]] colonial times. Old rich [[Molo, Iloilo City|Molo]] influential families helped shaped the town\u2019s not only economical but political and architectural sphere. The town just like the more Spanish or Mestizo town of [[Jaro, Iloilo City|Jaro]] has also a plethora of mansions built by old-rich Chinese-Spanish-Ilonggo Locsin, Lacson, Sayson, Layson and Pison families. The [[Molo, Iloilo City|Molo Church]] \u2018\u2019(Iglesia de Santa Ana)\u2019\u2019 which was built under the supervision of some of the members of notable Molo families like the \u2018\u2019Locsins\u2019\u2019, is the first and only feminist church outside [[Manila]] with its imposing fa\u00e7ade with gothic influence facing the \u2018\u2019Plaza Molo\u2019\u2019. The \u2018\u2019Yusay-Consing\u2019\u2019 Mansion or Molo Mansion located just across the Plaza Molo and Molo Church was bought by the retail and real estate giant [[SM Supermalls|SM Group]] has been refurbished and restored to its former glory and is now a houses several cultural stores and a mini-museum which exhibits several artworks and native products.\n\n[[File:Castle of Don Juan Ledesma.jpg|thumb|left|Castle of Don Juan Ledesma ''(Castillo de Don Juan Ledesma)'']]\n\nThe present economic boom of the 21st century has spurred modern developments across the city. Huge investments of big real estate developers built modern malls and shopping centers, tall and modern edifices and skyscrapers which sprouted up especially in new city\u2019s \u2018\u2019Central Business Center\u2019\u2019 which occupies a huge land area in the town of [[Mandurriao, Iloilo City|Mandurriao]]. The first tallest skyscraper in [[Western Visayas]], the Injap Tower of the Double Dragon Properties could be found in the area. Hotels and condominiums and tree lined avenues with jogging and bicycle lanes have also been built during the city\u2019s economic renaissance up to the present. The Iloilo\u2019s festival inspired iconic [[Iloilo Convention Center]] is also located in the [[Iloilo Business Park]].\n\n===Sustainability===\n\n[[File:Iloilo River Esplanade.JPG|thumb|The [[Iloilo River Esplanade]] at night.]]\n\nThe city has been a champion in air quality initiatives that further implied when in won in the 2017 \u2018\u2019Clean Air City Award\u2019\u2019 given by the Clean Air Philippine Movement.

It is the capital city of the [[Iloilo province|province of Iloilo]] where it is geographically situated but, in terms of government and administration, it is politically independent. In addition, it is the center of the [[Metro Iloilo-Guimaras|Iloilo-Guimaras Metropolitan Area]], as well as the regional center and [[primate city]] of the [[Western Visayas]] region. In the {{PH wikidata|population_as_of}}, Iloilo City had a population of {{PH wikidata|population_total}} inhabitants, with a 1.02% population annual growth rate.{{PH census|2015}} For the metropolitan area, the total population is 946,146 inhabitants.\n\nIloilo City is bordered by the towns of [[Oton, Iloilo|Oton]] in the west, [[Pavia, Iloilo|Pavia]] in the north and [[Leganes, Iloilo|Leganes]] in the northeast. Just across the [[Iloilo Strait]] in its eastern and southern coastlines, are the towns of [[Buenavista, Guimaras|Buenavista]] and [[Jordan, Guimaras|Jordan]] in the island-province of [[Guimaras]]. The city was a conglomeration of former towns, which are now the geo-political districts consisting of: [[Arevalo, Iloilo City|Villa Arevalo]], [[City Proper, Iloilo City|Iloilo City Proper]], [[Jaro, Iloilo City|Jaro]] (an independent city before), [[La Paz, Iloilo City|La Paz]], [[Mandurriao]] and [[Molo, Iloilo City|Molo]]. The district of [[Lapuz, Iloilo City|Lapuz]], a former part of La Paz, was declared a separate district in 2008.<ref>[http://www.thenewstoday.info/2008/12/22/city.to.recognize.lapuz.as.separate.district.from.la.paz.html City to recognize Lapuz as separate district from La Paz]. Thenewstoday.info (2008-12-22). Retrieved on 2011-11-07.</ref>\n\nThe foundation of Iloilo City dates back in 1566 when the Spaniards established a settlement area between the towns of Oton and the city's present district of La Villa Rica de Arevalo (Villa de Arevalo) as the second Spanish colonial seat after [[Cebu City|Cebu]] in the Philippine islands. Later during the revolution of the late 1800s, it was given the honorific title of \u201cLa Muy Leay y Noble Ciudad\u201d (\u201cThe Most Noble City\u201d) by the Queen Regent of Spain Maria Christina due to the loyalty of the Ilonggos to the Spanish crown, the second city to received a royal title in the country during the Spanish colonial period after [[Manila City|Manila]]. Iloilo is one of the few ''Royal Spanish Cities in the Philippines or [[Spanish East Indies]]'' along with [[Naga, Camarines Sur|Naga]], [[Cebu City|Cebu]] and [[Manila City|Manila]]. At the turn of the 20th century, Iloilo City was second to the primate city of Manila, with stores along ''Calle Real'' (Iloilo's Escolta and old business district) selling luxury products from all over the world, an agricultural experimental station established at La Paz in 1888, a school of arts and trades which opened in 1891, and a telephone network system operating in 1894.\n\nIn the coming of the Americans also in the turn of the 20th century, Protestantism was brought by them and institutions like [[Central Philippine University]] (the first Baptist and second private American university in Asia and in the country); [[Jaro Evangelical Church]] (the first Baptist church in the country); [[Iloilo Mission Hospital]] (the first Protestant hospital in the country); Jaro Adventist Center (first organized Seventh-day Adventist church in the country); and the [[Convention of Philippine Baptist Churches]] (the oldest Baptist organizational body in the Philippines); where established.\n\nIloilo is last capital of [[Spanish East Indies|Spanish Empire]] in Asia and the Pacific before the Philippines was handed over to the [[United States]] in 1898 through the [[Treaty of Paris (1898)|Treaty of Paris]] (1898).\n\nThe city is the regional hub of education, healthcare, tourism, culture, industry and economy in [[Western Visayas]]. As one of the notable culinary capitals of the country, delectable foods that came principally where Iloilo is famous of are [[Pancit Molo]] \nand [[Batchoy|La Paz Batchoy]]. It is also the seat of Regional Center of National Government Offices, financial institutions and government-owned and controlled corporations. Recent economic boom and the city's aim for modern and sustainable development as a ''\"Smart City of the Future\"'' using the technology of Internet of things as a tool for efficient delivery of services such as transportation, safety, emergency response, environmental management, and heritage conservation, among others.<ref>https://andreaguanco.com/iloilo-a-future-smart-city-goozam/</ref> The city's continued efforts in building parks, open spaces and making the metropolis clean and conducive to tourists, bagged the city the ASEAN Clean Tourist City award in 2020.<ref>https://philnews.ph/2019/11/29/iloilo-city-won-the-asean-clean-tourist-city-award/</ref> \n\nIloilo City is one of the thriving Centers of Economy in the country - an adequate and growing number of banks establishing branches leads the metropolis with the most number of banks savings deposits and accounts in the Western Visayas region (third in the Philippines); the Iloilo International Airport (4th busiest airport in the country); and with  the on-going building construction boom especially in the real estate and retail sectors.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://vicilongo.weebly.com/|title=Research Center for Iloilo|website=Research Center for Iloilo}}</ref> Iloilo city has the lowest crime rate in entire Philippines,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.philstar.com/lifestyle/travel-and-tourism/2017/05/27/1704179/walk-through-iloilo-business-park|title=A walk through Iloilo Business Park|website=philstar.com}}</ref> lowest level of corruption, highest life expectancy in Visayas and Mindanao, huge concentration of middle class and rank 1 in happiness index,<ref>{{cite news | url=https://ph.news.yahoo.com/ilonggos-enjoyment-life-rates-high-nscb-hdi-ranking-095219255.html | title=Ilonggos' Enjoyment Of Life Rates High In NSCB's HDI Ranking | date=2 February 2013 | work=Manila Bulletin | via=Yahoo | accessdate=14 August 2019 }}</ref> and the most business-friendly city<ref>https://www.bomboradyo.com/iloilo/iloilo-city-ginpasidunggan-nga-2019-most-business-friendly-lgu-award/</ref>\n\n== History ==\n{{See also|History of the Philippines|Irong-Irong}}\n\n=== [[Kadatuan]] [[Srivijaya]] ===\n\n{{see also | Maragtas |Greater India | Indosphere | Chola invasion of Srivijaya}}\nAccording to Spanish written accounts, the inhabitants of Panay island were hailed from [[Borneo]], [[Sulawesi]], and [[Sumatra]]. Panay might be named after the kingdom of [[Pannai]] which is located in Sumatra, since i and y are interchangeable in Spanish. Proof for this is corroborated by linguistic evidence such as [[Talang Tuo inscription]] where many Old Malayan words during [[Srivijayan]] survived in modern Ilongo Language. The [[Srivijayan]] City states of Sumatra was ruled by an Indian King [[Mah\u0101r\u0101ja]] with their [[Datuk|Datu]] , a lesser vassal Malayan chieftain.<ref>Kota Kapur inscription mentioned \"manraksa yan kadatuan \u00e7rivijaya\"</ref>\n\n=== Period of Malay Mass Migration ===\n{{see also | Greater India | Indosphere | Chola invasion of Srivijaya}}\n\nCruel rule of a certain Rajah Makatunao, the [[Maragtas|ten Bornean datus]] sailed to the island which they named [[Panay]], Pani or Panae (shortened word for Ananipay) as part of Visayan Empire. The Malayan Datus offered a golden hat ([[salakot]]) and a long pearl necklace called ''Manangyad'' in the [[Hiligaynon language]] (meaning a long necklace that touches or \"nagasangyad\" the ground) as a [[barter]] to the [[Ati people|Ati]] to allow them entry and habitation of the island. The Datus founded the [[Kadatuan]] [[Srivijaya]] consisted of several settlements called wanua/Benua/Banwa as corroborated by [[Kota Kapur inscription]].\n\nSome historians also affirm the Sumatran origin of the people of Panay, observing that the [[Visayans]] derived their [[Indosphere|writing system]] from those of [[Toba Batak people|Toba]], Borneo, Celebes, Ancient Java and from the [[Edicts of Ashoka|Edicts of the ancient Indian]] emperor [[Ashoka]].<ref name=\"auto4\">{{cite web|url=http://archive.org/details/lasislasvisayase00reye|title=Las islas Visayas en la epoca de la conquista|first=Isabelo de los|last=Reyes y Florentino|date=15 October 1889|publisher=Manila : Tipo-litografia de Chofre y ca.|via=Internet Archive}}</ref>\n\nThe very probable proof of Sumatran origin of the Malay settlement in Panay is the account of P. Francisco Colin, S.J, a historian who came to Asia during the early years of the Spanish conquest of the Philippines. The following is his personal observation recorded during his visit to Sumatra:\n\n{{quote|\"In the middle of Sumatra, there is a spacious and extensive lake (presumably [[Lake Toba]] near [[Pannai]]), around the shore of which many and several ethnic groups settle [and] from where, in the past, there was a forced exodus of inhabitants [constraining them] to sail to and to settle in various islands. One of these ethnic groups was subjugated there and they were unable to flee for various circumstances.

This resonates with the local Panay tradition regarding the arrival of ten [[Datu]]s from Borneo.\n\nThe kingdom of Pannai was a militant-nation allied under the Srivijaya [[Mandala (Southeast Asian political model)|Mandala]] that defended the conflict-ridden [[Strait of Malacca]], the world's busiest maritime choke-point.\n\nThe Visayan lore says that in the 13th century, [[Maragtas|ten Bornean datus]] came to the island which they named Panay, Pani or Panae (after the fallen kingdom of Pannai or a shortening of the Ati word for the island, Ananipay). This, after they dissented from the unjust rule of a certain Rajah Makatunao and exiled themselves. Upon arriving on the island of [[Panay]], they gave a golden hat ([[salakot]]) and a long pearl necklace called ''Manangyad'' in the [[Hiligaynon language]] (meaning a long necklace that touches or \"nagasangyad\" the ground) as a peace offering and treaty-items to the [[Ati people|Ati]] natives of the island. It was said that it was also a way of the ten Bornean datus to barter the flat lands of Panay from the Ati. One datu, named Paiburong, was given the territory of Irong-Irong (cf. also Kedatuan of Madja-as).<ref name=\"ilongo.weebly.com\">{{cite web|url=http://ilongo.weebly.com/iloilo-history-part-1.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304201139/http://ilongo.weebly.com/iloilo-history-part-1.html|url-status=dead|title=Iloilo History Part 1 - Research Center for Iloilo<!-- Bot generated title -->|archivedate=4 March 2016}}</ref><ref name=Lopez>{{cite book |title=Iloilo: A Rich and Noble Land |author=Lopez Group Foundation |year=2008 |publisher=Benpres Publishing |location=Pasig City, Philippines |isbn=978-971-93904-0-4 |page=278 }}</ref> The noble people of Panay (and thus Iloilo City) claim descent from these idealistic rebel royals and their few faithful and loyal soldiers who chose to abandon a wealthy but oppressed life under a foreign empire in Sumatra and Borneo and instead, build a state that was truer to their ideals in Panay island.

A truce was declared between the American and the Spanish forces pending the negotiations of the joint commission of both warring Countries in Paris, France for the terms of peace. Meanwhile, General Aguinaldo sent several small vessels to Panay with Tagalog revolutionaries in order to stir up rebellion in the Visayas. He was anxious to secure all territories he could before the conditions for peace should be settled in Paris. At stake was the hope that actual possession of territories would influence the final decision.<ref>John, Foreman, ''The Philippine Islands : a political, geographical, ethnographical, social and commercial history of the Philippine Archipelago, embracing the whole period of Spanish rule, with an account of the succeeding American insular government'', New York: 1907, C.

A government was constituted. On 17 January 1899, an election placed Raymundo Melliza, of a notable family from Molo that was respected by both the natives and foreigners, to office as Mayor. However, the influence of the new regime established by the government of Aguinaldo did not have effective extent far beyond a day's march from the Capital. At the threshold of the City and Province of Iloilo, the Americans were waiting for signal from Manila. Two more ships supplemented the U.S. forces, even though no clashes with the revolutionaries took place after the Spaniards abandoned the City. Miller expressed demands for the surrender of Iloilo but no gun was fired. The Americans were waiting for the right moment, for it was not until 6 February 1899 that the American Senate ratified the Treaty of Paris.<ref>John, Foreman, ''The Philippine Islands: a political, geographical, ethnographical, social and commercial history of the Philippine Archipelago, embracing the whole period of Spanish rule, with an account of the succeeding American insular government'', New York: 1907, C.

They were promised a monthly remuneration of Php4 and food, but only received Php1. Threats of mutiny, sacking and burning of the City, forced the Generals to collect money from the towns of Panay in order to appease the Visayan contingents. The same thing happened to the Tagalog component of the troops. The danger of riots in the City and the attitude of native soldiers fomented fear among the inhabitants. Chinese merchants closed their stores leaving only a small hole for transacting business. Many prominent families, who were in constant fear for their safety, went over to Negros Island in small schooners that flew the Philippine flag, without having any trouble with the American ships on standby in the waters between the two islands.<ref name=\"John, Foreman 1907, p. 513\"/>\n\nOn 10 February, an Extraordinary Session at the City Hall discussed plans for the impending bombardment of the City. There was a proposal to burn Iloilo, but the Mayor protested to this barbarous plan. A majority in the meeting was in favor of burning, which was seen as an invitation to despoil, lay waste and slay. The instigators who had no property interests in Iloilo, but who were so jealous of those who have, found a ready response of the Tagalog mercenaries, who had no local attachment to the City.<ref name=\"John, Foreman 1907, p. 515\">John, Foreman, ''The Philippine Islands : a political, geographical, ethnographical, social and commercial history of the Philippine Archipelago, embracing the whole period of Spanish rule, with an account of the succeeding American insular government'', New York: 1907, C.

In the meantime, from early morning, the withdrawing native soldiers, followed by a riffraff mob, were observed to have rushed hither and thither, throwing firebrands on to petroleum-washed houses. The Chinese had to barricade themselves to no use since fire burned their bazaars. Europeans and the Spanish half-castes had to defend themselves with every means possible, including bribing the rioters with a few pesos. Two British warships in the roadstead sent boats ashore and landed a party of marines, who made a gallant effort to save foreign properties,<ref name=\"John, Foreman 1907, p. 515\"/> as the United Kingdom had a strong business interest in Iloilo and a Consulate.\n\nBy 1 o'clock of the same day, the Americans made a landing and restored order. Sentinels were stationed to protect what still remained of the townspeople's goods. In due course, indemnity claims were forwarded to the American military authorities, but were all rejected.<ref>John, Foreman, ''The Philippine Islands : a political, geographical, ethnographical, social and commercial history of the Philippine Archipelago, embracing the whole period of Spanish rule, with an account of the succeeding American insular government'', New York: 1907, C.

That event was the cause of the ruin of such a beautiful city, second only to Manila, where, if there was not a surplus of money, neither the people's welfare was wanting, and life was prosperous and peaceful. If the brain who planted such an unqualified act had measured the consequences... maybe he would never have dared doing it...\"<ref>''Nuevo Heraldo'', Iloilo, 11 February 1908.</ref>\n\nBy February 1899, the Americans had started mobilizing to colonize anew the City and Province. They continued to meet resistance from the Ilonggos, which lasted up to 1901. In which case, Iloilo was also among the last cities to fall to Americans.<ref name=Lopez/> Many leaders surrendered to the new regime and were reintegrated to the Ilonggo society without conditions. Among them was General Martin Delgado, who accepted the position of Governor of the Province of Iloilo from 1901 to 1904, under the American flag. He was, at that time, the highest paid Governor in the whole Archipelago, receiving $3,000 gold annually.<ref>''The San Francisco Call'', 12 April 1901, p. 2.</ref>\n\nLocal government was established in some towns of Iloilo by 11 April 1901. Jose Maria Gay was appointed Alcalde, Matias Hibiernas was teniente alcalde of Iloilo;Jose Yusay was President of Molo; Pablo Borromeo was President of Arevalo; Ruperto Montinola was the lone representative of Jaro, but was not its President; Madurriao's President was Emigdio Mesa. Emilio Magbanua was appointed its police delegate. It was observed by Juan de Leon, judge of the Court of First Instance that there existed a rivalry between the pueblos of Iloilo, Jaro and Molo, which are adjacent to and are only half an hour travel by carriage from each other. Besides, Molo and Jaro are residential pueblos, and Iloilo was the business town for both. It was also recommended that Arevalo be joined to Molo, and La Paz to Jaro.

Visayans of position, with property interests at stake, were convinced that absolute independence without any control or protection from some established political power was premature and doomed to disaster. The Visayan grudge against the Tagalog predominance was also a factor that contributed to the failure of Aguinaldo's government. But the aggravating factor was the dictatorial air and brutal conduct of the Tagalog troops, which destroyed the theory of fraternal unity.<ref>John, Foreman, ''The Philippine Islands : a political, geographical, ethnographical, social and commercial history of the Philippine Archipelago, embracing the whole period of Spanish rule, with an account of the succeeding American insular government'', New York: 1907, C.

The Augustinians, who were the first to bring the Christian faith in the Philippines as well as in Panay island, and who built the centuries-old heritage churches in this island,<ref>Cf. Fr. Juan Fernandez, O.S.A, Monografias de los pueblos de la isla de Panay in Monographs of the Towns of Panay, Jose Espinosa, Jr., trans., Iloilo City: University of San Augustine, 2006</ref> established the [[University of San Agustin|Collegio de San Agust\u00edn]] in 1904, which eventually became the only university of the Augustinian Order in Asia. During the American regime, their confreres from the United States developed evermore this institution, which later became the first university in Iloilo. The American Catholic Bishops also maintained and upgraded the [[St. Vincent Ferrer Seminary]] (established in 1869 as the Collegio-Seminario de San Vicente Ferrer), which was the first institution of higher learning in Western Visayas. Despite the Augustinians being Catholics and Baptists being Protestants, they mutually enriched each other through dialogue mainly because Augustinian ideals were the foundations of Protestantism since the first Protestant was [[Martin Luther]] and he was a former Augustinian priest himself and the Protestant zeal for reformation from corruption even started some reform in the church itself. [[Saint Ezekiel Moreno]] who was ordained in the Minor Orders in Jaro, Iloilo had walked the fine line between reform, obedience and leadership since he ministered and walked hand in hand with condemned rebels and criminals in the [[Iwahig Prison and Penal Farm]], he was also obedient to his superiors in the [[Order of Augustinian Recollects]], a reform or \"Recollection\" movement in the Augustinian Order, which took elements from the Protestant Reformation. Saint Ezekiel Moreno also became the leader of a political movement when he became a Bishop of [[Pasto, Colombia]].<ref>http://www.lablaa.org/blaavirtual/revistas/credencial/octubre1993/octubre2.htm</ref> The visitation of Saint Ezekiel Moreno is a harmonized incarnation of the ancient [[Conviv\u00e8ncia]] in Spain when different religions and kingdoms; Pagan, Christian, Jewish and Muslim lived side by side and struggled to maintain their perspective purity, contested with each other and yet also mutually enriched each other without turning into a mongrelized melting pot of a mixed up and confused morass. Coincidentally, Saint Ezekiel Moreno was ordained in the Minor Orders in the then church of Jaro which housed a Virgin Mary statue under the Title of \"[[Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de la Candelaria de Jaro]]\". An image with complex Conviv\u00e8ncia alluding properties due to the confluence of many symbols from various cultures simultaneously present in the image but it is likely not earthly of nature and is a pure grace direct from heaven or an image \"Not carved by human hands\" due to its miraculous nature which was found floating in a river, shifting in weight and growing in size.\n\n[[File:The National geographic magazine (Page 494) BHL40563491.jpg|thumb|left|A market in Iloilo, in the 1910s]]\nThe Paulinian Sisters took charge of St. Paul Hospital, originally owned by the Catholic Diocese of Jaro. Bishop [[Dennis Joseph Dougherty]], who later became [[Cardinal (Catholic Church)|Cardinal]] [[Archbishop]] of [[Philadelphia]], gave the medical facilities to the Sisters. To commemorate the bishop's generosity, the hospital named a more recent section of the facilities after him: the CADMA (Cardinal Dougherty Medical Annex). To meet the growing need to provide nurses for their hospital, the Paulinians also opened a nursing school. Today, this institution has also become a university ([[St. Paul University Iloilo]]), and has ever since supplied high-quality healthcare professionals known worldwide for their skills and dedication to work.\n\n[[File:St. Paul Hospital Iloilo c. 1920.jpg|thumb|St. Paul Hospital c. 1920]]\nDuring the American colonial occupation, one of the platforms by the colonial government was first to establish and implement a public education system in the islands and the [[Thomasites]] were deployed and commissioned by the American government to teach in the public schools that will be established. The Thomasites tolerated religious freedom, which is one of the foundations of the [[United States]] constitution and legacy to the Philippines, while commissioned and under their tutelage to teach in public schools during the colonial period. Public schools that were established when the [[Thomasites]] came to Iloilo are Iloilo Normal School, the present-day [[West Visayas State University]] (formally established in 1924 but dates back its founding in 1902 as part of the Philippine Normal School System in the Philippines); the Iloilo National High School, the first public provincial high school in the islands; and Baluarte Elementary School, the first public elementary school in the islands.\n\nCommonwealth Act No. 57 was passed in 1936 granting city status to Iloilo; this charter was immediately amended by Commonwealth Act No. 158 some days later to incorporate the municipalities of [[La Paz, Iloilo City|La Paz]] and [[Arevalo, Iloilo City|Arevalo]] as part of the new city's territory.<ref>{{Citation |title=Commonwealth Act No. 158 - An Act to amend Commonwealth Act Numbered Fifty-seven, entitled \"An Act establishing a form of government for the City of Iloilo |publisher=Supreme Court E-Library |url=http://elibrary.judiciary.gov.ph/thebookshelf/showdocs/29/16363 |access-date=2019-12-31}}</ref> Iloilo regained cityhood status on 16 July 1937, through Commonwealth Act 158.

During [[World War II]], Iloilo was controlled by several Japanese battalions. Japan's ultimate goal was to entrench itself deeply into the Philippines so that at the close of the war they could occupy it just as the Spanish and the Americans had years before.\n\nWhen Iloilo was liberated by Filipino and American forces from Japanese military occupation on 25 March 1945, the remnants of these battalions were held in Jaro Plaza as a makeshift detention facility.<ref name=Lopez/>\n\n===Post-war decline and recovery===\n\nThe war heavily damaged the infrastructure in Iloilo. However, the continuing conflict between the labor unions in the port area, declining sugar economy, and the deteriorating peace and order situation in the countryside, the exodus of Ilonggos to other cities, provinces/regions and islands that offered better opportunities and business. People were moving to other cities such as Bacolod, Cebu, and Manila that led to Iloilo's decline in economic importance in central Philippines. Rural agricultural areas continued to help the local economy. For years, because of this exodus of investors, Iloilo's economy progressed in a moderate pace.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=McCoy |first1=Alfred |year=1982|title=A Queen Dies Slowly |journal=Philippine Social History : Global Trade and Local Transformations |publisher=Ateneo de Manila University Press |pages=289\u2013358}}</ref>\n\nChange slowly came. First came the construction of the fishing port and a new international seaport. One by one, commercial business firms invested in Iloilo, spurring on the city to its eventual recovery.\n\nIloilo became a highly urbanized city in 1979 by the virtue of Batas Pambansa Blg. 51.

The city faces Iloilo Strait and [[Guimaras]] Island across it, making it a natural harbor and a safe anchorage for ships. The city lies on a flat alluvial plain, reclaimed mostly from the swampy areas due to urbanization and industrialization in the late 19th century until the present. Traversing the city are the rivers of Iloilo, Batiano, Jaro and Dungon Creek. [[Iloilo River]] is an [[estuary]] that separates the districts of City Proper, Molo and Villa Arevalo from the rest of the city. On the other hand, Jaro River is fed by its tributary rivers, Aganan and Tigum. Lately, a new escape channel for floodwaters coming from these two rivers to Iloilo Straight was developed, the Jaro Floodway. Iloilo City is {{convert|337.6|nmi|km|-1}} from [[Manila]], {{convert|116|km}} from [[Roxas City]], {{convert|158|km}} from [[Kalibo]], and {{convert|97|km}} from [[San Jose de Buenavista]].

All of the districts were once individual towns, excluding Lapuz, which was a sub-district of La Paz until 2008.{{refn|In 1903, the municipalities of Jaro, La Paz, Mandurriao, and Molo, were incorporated into the municipality of Iloilo. Pavia was also incorporated into Iloilo from Santa Barbara in 1905. In 1908, Pavia and Jaro were separated from Iloilo and constituted as the municipality of Jaro. La Paz was re-established as a separate municipality in 1920. In 1937, the town of Iloilo was amalgamated with the towns of La Paz and Ar\u00e9valo as one [[chartered city]]. The municipality of [[Jaro, Iloilo City|Jaro]], on the other hand, was re-incorporated into Iloilo City in 1941.}} All districts have their own town centers complete with a plaza, a Roman Catholic church, a fire station, a police station and a public market. City Proper is a commercial area and the political center of the city and the Province of Iloilo and the Regional Government Center of Western Visayas.\n\nIloilo City is the center of the only officially recognized Metropolitan Area in Western Visayas.{{efn|Presidential Executive Order No. 559 of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo signed on 28 August 2006}} The metropolitan area is composed of the City of Iloilo, the municipalities of Leganes, Pavia, Santa Barbara, Cabatuan, San Miguel, Oton, the Island Province of Guimaras and its five municipalities, namely - Sibunag, San Lorenzo, Nueva Valencia, Buenavista and Jordan.\n\nThe city of Iloilo has only [[Legislative district of Iloilo City|one legislative district]] and is subdivided into 180 [[barangay]]s ([[barrio]]s).<ref>{{cite news | last =Espejo, Jr. | first =Boy | title =Pacifico Sudario: The man who coined \"Dinagyang\" | publisher =Sun.Star Network Online | url =http://www.sunstar.com.ph/specials/dinagyang%202003/features.html | accessdate =2009-08-08 | url-status =dead | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20090604062700/http://www.sunstar.com.ph/specials/dinagyang%202003/features.html | archivedate =2009-06-04 }}</ref>\n<!-- Please do not revert to turn back the former article with auto collapse list of Barangays in Iloilo City because it consumes a lot of space designated for a said part of article.

In addition, other local languages such as [[Karay-a language|Karay-a]] (also known as Kinaray-a or obsolete Haraya) is also spoken. [[Spanish language in the Philippines|Spanish]], once widely spoken during the colonial era up to the 1980s, is dying out, though a broken Spanish creole is spoken by a few of some Spanish-blood families and elderly sugar barons.\n\nHiligaynon is spoken in Panay, Guimaras and Negros islands, and is part of the [[Visayan language family]] of the [[Malayo-Polynesian languages]]. Because Iloilo was a former Spanish colony for 300 years, Hiligaynon is heavily influenced by the Spanish language with a plethora of loaned words ''(Guerra, Puerta, Golpe, Aguanta, Puerto, Calle, and Edificio, among others)''. Hiligaynon is mainly concentrated in the provinces of Iloilo, Guimaras and Negros Occidental. The language is referred to as \"Ilonggo\" ({{lang-es|Ilongo/Ylongo}}) in Iloilo and Negros Occidental. More precisely, \"Ilonggo\" is the ethno-linguistic group referring to the inhabitants of Iloilo and the culture associated with native Hiligaynon speakers. The distinction between the terms, Ilonggo and Hiligaynon, is unclear however, as most of the townspeople are claiming that Hiligaynon is the language being spoken and Ilonggo is a term used to refer a person living in Iloilo or its associated culture and ethnicity.\n\n=== Religion ===\n\n[[File:Jaro Cathedral (Catedral de Jaro).jpg|thumb|left|[[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Jaro|Jaro Cathedral]] ''([[Jaro Cathedral|Catedral de Jaro/Catedral Metropolitana de Jaro]]) or National Shrine of Our Lady of Candles'' which is the seat of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Jaro]] is one of the largest Roman Catholic Archdioceses in the Philippines. The present Archdiocese of [[Capiz province|Capiz]], the islands of [[Palawan]] and [[Mindoro]] and [[Zamboanga Peninsula|Zamboanga]] were former parts of its ecclesiastical jurisdiction before they became a separate bishopric.\n\nAs the second National Shrine in the Visayas (first in Western Visayas and first Marian dedicated church to do so outside Luzon), Jaro Cathedral is likewise widely known as the seat of Roman Catholicism in Western Visayas.]]\n\n[[File:Bishop Jose Romeo O. Lazo (2).jpg|thumb|160px|[[Jose Romeo O. Lazo]], the incumbent Roman Catholic Archbishop of Jaro.]]\n\nIloilo City is one of the notable centers of faith in the Philippines. Due to the heavy Spanish Missions, the city's population is predominant Catholic with over 95% belonging to the Roman Catholic Church. Other religious minorities such as [[Protestant]]s (5%), Iglesia NI Cristo(2%) and Aglipayans (1%) (also a form of Episcopal [[Protestantism]]) have a significant presence at the city.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://psa.gov.ph/sites/default/files/attachments/hsd/specialrelease/Iloilo%20City_Statistical%20Tables.xls |title=Statistics |website=psa.gov.ph |access-date=2019-10-15}}</ref>\n\nThe former city of [[Jaro, Iloilo City|Jaro]] (one of the present districts (boroughs) of Iloilo city) is the seat of bishopric and pioneer Christian institutions not only in Western Visayas but in the whole Philippines established through the Spanish colonization. The Spaniards which brought the Catholic faith established the [[Roman Catholic]] metropolitan see of the [[Archdiocese of Jaro]] with its diocesan cathedral while the Americans which brought the Protestantism established the Convention of Philippine Baptist Churches (the first and oldest Baptist churches organization in the Philippines), the [[Jaro Evangelical Church]] (the first Baptist church in the Philippine islands), and Jaro Adventist Center (first organized Adventist church in the Philippines).\n\nThe Roman Catholic Archdiocese is one of the oldest and largest bishopric sees in the country. It was established as a parish in 1587 initially covering Catmon, Cabatuan and Maasin . It was created a diocese by virtue of a papal bull of Pope Pius IX on 27 May 1865 . It has jurisdiction over sufragan bishops of [[Mindoro]], [[Palawan]], [[Zamboanga Peninsula|Zamboanga]], the provinces of [[Iloilo]] , [[Guimaras]], [[San Jose de Buenavista]] , [[Capiz]], [[Bacolod]], San Carlos and [[Kabankalan]] in Negros Occidental.\n\nIt lost some of its territory to establish the Diocese of Zamboanga and Apostolic Prefecture of Palawan. Much later, three other ecclesiastical jurisdictions were established from parts of its territory: Diocese of Bacolod (15 July 1932), Apostolic Prefecture of Mindoro (2 July 1936), and Diocese of Capiz (27 January 1951). The diocese was elevated into a Metropolitan Archdiocese by Pope Pius XII. Later, on 24 March 1962, it lost further some of its territory that resulted to the establishment the Territorial Prelature of San Jose de Antique (but still a part of it at present).\n\n[[File:Jaro Evangelical Church.jpg|thumb|upright|right|[[Jaro Evangelical Church]], the first Baptist Church in the Philippines (second Protestant Church in the Philippines and first Protestant Church outside Manila in the Philippines both after the [[Central United Methodist Church (Manila)]] (1899)) by the Northern American Baptists.]]\n\nThe Jaro Cathedral (National Shrine of the Our Lady of Candles) is the seat of the Archdiocese of Jaro. Saint Elizabeth of Hungary and the Our Lady of Candles are the official Catholic patronesses of the Archdiocese. The Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de la Candelaria or Our Lady of the Candles is the official patron of the whole Western Visayas and Romblon. Its image or statue perched atop the facade of the cathedral is ''the first and only Marian image crowned by a Pope and saint ([[Pope John Paul II]]) in the Philippines and Asia''.\n\nBeing designated as a National Shrine, Jaro Cathedral is likewise widely known as the seat of Roman Catholicism in Western Visayas. The said designation (National Shrine) by the Catholic Bishops Conference of the Philippines is the first of its kind in the region, the second in Western Visayas (after Cebu), and the first Marian dedicated church outside of Luzon.\n\n[[Protestantism]] forms as the second largest faith in the City of Iloilo. Protestant sects was brought by the [[United States|American]]s when the [[Philippines]] was ceded to the [[United States|American]] rule by [[Spain]] through the 1898 Treaty of Paris.\n\nThe said faith brought by the [[United States]] in the heavily Roman Catholic Iloilo has gained adherents and still continues to grow at present. Iloilo which is one of the pioneering places in the country that Protestants set foot is strongly contributed due to its economic importance in the international scene in the early 1900s. The American colonial government tolerated religious freedom that even to this day Iloilo is still a predominantly Catholic.\n\n[[Presbyterian]]s and [[Baptist]]s are among the first Protestant sects that arrived in Iloilo. The arrival of American brand of Protestant denominations resulted to the establishment of notable pioneering institutions in Iloilo. The [[Presbyterian]]s established the [[Iloilo Mission Hospital]] in 1901 (the first American and Protestant hospital in the Philippines) while [[Baptist]]s established the American [[John D.

''Hublas of Panay News'' is the sole Hiligaynon tabloid newspaper. Iloilo has a glossy full color lifestyle magazine named ''Cream Magazine'' published monthly since 1989.\n\nIloilo City is the main headquarters of [[Bombo Radyo Philippines]], which owns Bombo Radio AM stations and Star FM stations across the country. Being the urban center of the province, most of the AM and FM radio stations serve the province of Iloilo and [[Guimaras]], mostly local stations of national radio stations.\n\nTelevision arrived in the city in 1964 when [[DYAF-TV]] began airing, serving Iloilo City and the neighboring towns in the province. In 1998, with the frequency transfer to Channel 10, ABS-CBN separated its news team from the Bacolod news team and launched TV Patrol Iloilo (today [[TV Patrol Panay]]). In 1967, [[DYXX-TV|TV-6 Iloilo]] (a TV5 affiliate) stated its initial broadcast in Jaro, Iloilo City. By 1974 it changed its affiliation to [[GMA Network]] as their local television station. The channel started upgrading its facilities and relocated their TV tower to Guimaras and began serving Iloilo City, [[Panay]] and [[Guimaras]], as well as some parts of [[Negros Occidental]] in 1998.

Iloilo City has a multitude of districts, each with its distinctive character and representing colonial influence. Iloilo's other distinctive features include its cityscape surrounded with water features such us rivers and is bounded by a sea; bicycle paths and ornamental trees that line most city streets; and its many open spaces, gardens and parks.\n\nIloilo spreads out with its location in a plain land in south eastern side of Panay Island. It is bounded in the south east side by Iloilo-Guimaras Strait and Guimaras Island which makes the city as a natural harbor for ships. The two main rivers of Iloilo and Batiano snakes through the city and empties out of the Iloilo-Guimaras Strait.\n\nIloilo is a conglomerate of former separate towns which includes the former city of [[Jaro, Iloilo City|Jaro]] established during the Spanish colonial times, thus the layout of the towns civic centers follows a typical Spanish colonial town center composed of a [[Plaza]] (Public Square), church, municipal hall and other religious, academic and government instrumentalities offices. A modern development is clustered in an organized form in the city's premises but is strongly concentrated in the Mandurriao district to protect the city's initiatives in protecting the city's skyline, heritage zones and environment. Present modern developments spread out outside the city in neighboring towns that are a part of Metropolitan Iloilo.\n\n===Architecture===\n[[File:Lopez_Heritage_House_clode.jpg|thumb|220px|right|Nelly's Garden or Lopez Mansion ''(Mansion de Lopez)'' in Jaro is regaled as the ''\"Queen of all Heritage Houses in Western Visayas\"''.]]\n\nIloilo City's urban planning and architecture reflect the plans of the Spanish and the American colonial administrations. Since Iloilo City is a conglomeration of towns, the districts have their own plazas which are surrounded by establishments of political and ecclesiastical influence, such as churches and old administrative halls. In 1930, [[Juan M. Arellano]] of the Bureau of Public Works designed the schematic plan for Iloilo City, which was influenced by [[Ebenezer Howard]]'s \"Garden City.\"<ref name=heritage>{{Citation | author = Iloilo City Cultural Heritage Conservation Council | title = Republic of the Philippines Iloilo City Conservation Planning and Development Guidelines for the Downtown Central Business District (CBD)Heritage Zone | url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/33612277/Conservation-Planning-and-Development-Guidelines-for-the-Downtown-Central-Business-District-CBD-Heritage-Zone | pages = 16\u201317 | accessdate = 4 November 2010 }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Villa Lizares (Lizares Mansion).jpg|thumb|220px|left|The [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux-Arts]] Villa Lizares (Lizares Mansion) in the town of Jaro.]]\n\nThe [[Spanish culture|Spanish]] colonial influence is strongly imprinted not only in Iloilo's history and cultural background but also the architectural perspective.\n\nThe city's regaled status during the Spanish colonial era until the turn of the 20th century is implied during by the sugar boom with ubiquitous stately mansions and edifices built by the old money Ilonggo Sugar Baron and elite families which contrast to the city's economic importance as a second city next to Manila during the said era in the Philippines.  The city's other moniker \u2013 \u2018\u2019City of Mansions\u2019\u2019  is likewise implied because Iloilo holds 240 mansions in which 30 of it are grand mansions built during the Spanish and American colonial eras.\n\n[[File:Campanario_de_Jaro_(Jaro_Belfry).jpg|thumb|200px|right|Campanario de Jaro (Jaro Belfry), one of the few free standing bell towers in the Philippines that is detached from the church.]]\n\nThe ravaged \u2018\u2019Fuerte de San Pedro\u2019\u2019 (Fort San Pedro) is Iloilo\u2019s ground zero as there was no Iloilo City back in the 1600s. As a fortress, Fort San Pedro was built solely by the Spaniards to protect Iloilo from the marauding pirates and privateers. The fort is the second Spanish built fort after the one in Cebu (also Fort San Pedro) in the Philippines and Asia. The foundation of the Fort San Pedro was substantial to the Spanish Empire\u2019s stronghold as Panay Island with Iloilo as their second colonial center established through the Iloilo precursor towns of [[Oton, Iloilo|Oton]] (1566) and [[Arevalo, Iloilo City|La Villa Rica de Arevalo]] (1581). Oton which was founded as early as 1566 but formally established in 1572 was the actual second seat of Spanish colonial powers but due to pirate attacks, they moved the capital eastward and established the \u2018\u2019La Villa Rica de Arevalo\u2019\u2019.\n\nThe town of La Villa Rica de Arevalo holds some of the fine example of Spanish built mansions like the mansion of the Spanish Governor General, but were destroyed when the pirates ransacked and destroyed the town. It was in the said frequent events of pirate attacks that the Spaniards moved finally the capital further eastward in the mouth of \u2018\u2019Rio de Iloilo\u2019\u2019 (Iloilo River) which is flanked and protected by [[Guimaras Island]] across it.\n\n[[File:Casa de Emperador (Iloilo Museum of Contemporary Art).jpg|thumb|left|220px|Casa de Emperador in [[Iloilo Business Park]], an example of modern built classical styled edifice.]]\n\nIt was in the said establishment of the city on the mouth of Iloilo River that as years go by, the city flourished to its heights especially in the economic and regal importance in the Spanish and American eras. La Villa Rica de Arevalo (Arevalo) is the first Spanish named town in the Philippine islands. It is also in Arevalo that the third oldest image of Holy Child Jesus (Se\u00f1or Santo Ni\u00f1o) in the Philippines was brought by the Spaniards. Notable present day structures that are repositories that attest to the town's former glory as a Spanish precursor town of Iloilo is the mansion of Balay Cami\u00f1a na Bato and the Convento de Arevalo.\n\nDuring the Spanish and American eras, the city developed its own unique charm that exudes a typical European city in the east which differed it from other cities just like the old Manila in the Philippines. It was in the said eras that architectural perspective of Iloilo flourished with European styled edifices and stately mansions was built which stands of Iloilo's once economic and political importance in its heyday.\n\n[[File:Aduana de Iloilo - Iloilo Customs House.jpg|thumb|right|220px|''Aduana de Iloilo'' (Iloilo Customs House) with the ''Muelle Loney'' (Loney Dock) which was used as a wharf and port of call berthing ships that plied international routes when the ''[[Port of Iloilo|Puerto de Iloilo]]'' ([[Port of Iloilo]]) was opened to the world market on 29 September 1855 by [[Queen Isabella II of Spain]].]]\n\n[[Calle Real, Iloilo|Calle Real]] (Spanish for Royal Street) which stretches from Plazoleta Gay up to Plaza Alfonso XII (Plaza Libertad) is Iloilo's Escolta (a heritage street in Manila) lined with commercial edifices that possesses European designs. Calle Real is Iloilo's old Central Business District and is considered as the second most preserved heritage business district in the Philippines. The street during the Iloilo's economic heyday during the late 19th and early 20th centuries when the \u2018\u2019Puerto de Iloilo\u2019\u2019 (Port of Iloilo) was opened to the international trade is a melting pot and common ground for people of different walks of life, race and color. Stores back then in Calle Real sells luxury goods and items from all over the world.\n\nIloilo also possesses structures built during the prelude of the American colonial period in the Philippines. ''Aduana de Iloilo'' (Iloilo Customs House) and old Iloilo City Hall are notable of the structures built during the said colonial period. Iloilo Customs House, the second largest customs house after the Aduana in Manila was built the Filipino Architect [[Juan M. Arellano]].\n\nIn farther north is the town of [[Jaro, Iloilo City|Jaro]], the largest of all the district of the City of Iloilo. Once a separate city before it merged with the City of Iloilo in the 1940s, is considered as a town of piousness, old rich and grandeur. Many notable Spanish Ilonggos settled and the said area and built their grand mansions and villas. The town\u2019s architecture is heavily influenced by the Hispanic and American cultures.\n\n[[File:St. Anne Parish (Molo Church).jpg|thumb|left|Iglesia de Molo (St. Anne Parish), the first Gothic and feminist church outside Manila.]]\n\nGrand mansions with imposing European styled facades and motifs of ''\u2018\u2019Buena Familias\u2019\u2019'' or ''\"Old-rich families\"'' (Spanish-Chinese-Filipino families) of Jaro like the Lopez, Ledesma, Lizares, Jalandoni, Javellana and Locsin families that some of it lines the first millionaire row in the Philippine islands still stands to this day. Two of notable mansions that attest to Jaro\u2019s importance as an old rich town that developed out of the sugar boom during the Spanish colonial period is the Mansion de Lopez (Lopez Mansion) or Nelly Garden and the beaux-art styled Villa Lizares (Lizares Mansion) which houses at present the Angelicum School Iloilo of the Dominicans.\n\nReligion is also a crucial factor that influenced Jaro\u2019s architectural and town plan perspective as it is the cradle of Christian faith in [[Western Visayas]]. The Spanish which brought the Roman Catholic faith established the [[Jaro Cathedral]] (National Shrine of the Our Lady Candles) with its separate belfry located across it (one of the few churches in the Philippines with a detached belfry) and the [[St. Vincent Ferrer Seminary|Seminario-Colegio de San Vicente Ferrer]] (the first institution of Higher Learning in Western Visayas). The advent of American colonialization which brought Protestantism has resulted also to the establishment of institutions.\n\n[[File:Festive Walk Parade (Phase 2).jpg|thumb|''Torre del Reloj'' (The Clock Tower) of Festive Walk Parade at [[Iloilo Business Park]]. Its construction is a result of the economic boom of the City of Iloilo since 2010.]]\n\nFine examples of institutions with edifices possessing American architecture and influence includes the [[Central Philippine University]] by the Protestant Baptists in 1905 which holds century old American colonial styled edifices, the [[Convention of Philippine Baptist Churches]] which housed at the European styled former (Rupert) Montinola Mansion in Fajardo, Jaro, and the [[Jaro Evangelical Church]] (the first Baptist Church in the Philippine Islands), are among the few of the notable institutions that holds a number of structures that possesses American architectural influence design.\n\nThe town of [[Molo, Iloilo City|Molo]] located westward of the \u2018\u2019La Punta\u2019\u2019 (City Proper) is sometimes called \u2018\u2019Parian\u2019\u2019 or Chinese town during the [[Spanish people|Spanish]] colonial times. Old rich [[Molo, Iloilo City|Molo]] influential families helped shaped the town\u2019s not only economical but political and architectural sphere. The town just like the more Spanish or Mestizo town of [[Jaro, Iloilo City|Jaro]] has also a plethora of mansions built by old-rich Chinese-Spanish-Ilonggo Locsin, Lacson, Sayson, Layson and Pison families. The [[Molo, Iloilo City|Molo Church]] \u2018\u2019(Iglesia de Santa Ana)\u2019\u2019 which was built under the supervision of some of the members of notable Molo families like the \u2018\u2019Locsins\u2019\u2019, is the first and only feminist church outside [[Manila]] with its imposing fa\u00e7ade with gothic influence facing the \u2018\u2019Plaza Molo\u2019\u2019. The \u2018\u2019Yusay-Consing\u2019\u2019 Mansion or Molo Mansion located just across the Plaza Molo and Molo Church was bought by the retail and real estate giant [[SM Supermalls|SM Group]] has been refurbished and restored to its former glory and is now a houses several cultural stores and a mini-museum which exhibits several artworks and native products.\n\n[[File:Castle of Don Juan Ledesma.jpg|thumb|left|Castle of Don Juan Ledesma ''(Castillo de Don Juan Ledesma)'']]\n\nThe present economic boom of the 21st century has spurred modern developments across the city. Huge investments of big real estate developers built modern malls and shopping centers, tall and modern edifices and skyscrapers which sprouted up especially in new city\u2019s \u2018\u2019Central Business Center\u2019\u2019 which occupies a huge land area in the town of [[Mandurriao, Iloilo City|Mandurriao]]. The first tallest skyscraper in [[Western Visayas]], the Injap Tower of the Double Dragon Properties could be found in the area. Hotels and condominiums and tree lined avenues with jogging and bicycle lanes have also been built during the city\u2019s economic renaissance up to the present.
