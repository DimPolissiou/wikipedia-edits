It was first announced by [[Bill Gates]] on August 1, 1988, at [[COMDEX]] in Las Vegas. Initially a marketing term for an [[office suite]] (bundled set of productivity [[application software|applications]]), the first version of Office contained [[Microsoft Word]], [[Microsoft Excel]], and [[Microsoft PowerPoint]]. Over the years, Office applications have grown substantially closer with shared features such as a common spell checker, [[Object Linking and Embedding|OLE]] data integration and [[Visual Basic for Applications]] scripting language. Microsoft also positions Office as a development platform for line-of-business software under the [[Office Business Applications]] brand. On July 10, 2012, [[Softpedia]] reported that Office was being used by over a billion people worldwide.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://news.softpedia.com/news/Microsoft-s-Office-Has-Over-One-Billion-Users-280426.shtml |title=Microsoft\u2019s Office Has over One Billion Users |work=[[Softpedia]] |publisher=SoftNews |date=July 10, 2012}}</ref>\n\nOffice is produced in several versions targeted towards different end-users and computing environments. The original, and most widely used version, is the [[desktop computer|desktop]] version, available for [[personal computer|PCs]] running the [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] and [[macOS]] [[operating system]]s. [[Office on the web]] is a version of the software that runs within a [[web browser]], while Microsoft also maintains [[Microsoft Office mobile apps|Office mobile apps]] for [[Android (operating system)|Android]] and [[iOS]].\n\nSince [[Office 2013]], Microsoft has promoted [[Office 365]] as the primary means of obtaining Microsoft Office: it allows the use of the software and other services on a [[subscription business model]], and users receive free feature updates to the software for the lifetime of the subscription, including new features and [[cloud computing]] integration that are not necessarily included in the \"on-premises\" releases of Office sold under conventional license terms. In 2017, revenue from Office 365 overtook conventional license sales.\n\nThe current on-premises, desktop version of Office is [[Microsoft Office 2019|Office 2019]], released on September 24, 2018.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-starts-rolling-out-office-2019-for-windows-and-mac/|title=Microsoft starts rolling out Office 2019 for Windows and Mac|last=Foley|first=Mary Jo|website=ZDNet|language=en|access-date=2019-02-06}}</ref>\n\n{{TOC limit}}\n\n==Components==\n{{See also|List of Microsoft Office programs}}\n\n===Desktop applications===\nUnless stated otherwise, desktop applications are available for Windows and macOS.\n* '''[[Microsoft Word]]:''' a [[word processor]] included in Microsoft Office and some editions of the now-discontinued [[Microsoft Works]].

Word 1.0 could be purchased with a bundled mouse, though none was required. Following the precedents of [[LisaWrite]] and [[MacWrite]], Word for Macintosh attempted to add closer [[WYSIWYG]] features into its package. Word for Mac was released in 1985. Word for Mac was the first graphical version of Microsoft Word. Initially, it implemented the proprietary [[Doc (computing)|.doc]] format as its primary format. Word 2007, however, deprecated this format in favor of [[Office Open XML]], which was later standardized by [[Ecma International]] as an [[open format]]. Support for [[Portable Document Format]] (PDF) and [[OpenDocument]] (ODF) was first introduced in Word for Windows with [[Service Pack]] 2 for Word 2007.<ref>{{cite press release|url=https://www.microsoft.com/Presspass/press/2008/may08/05-21ExpandedFormatsPR.mspx |title=Microsoft Expands List of Formats Supported in Microsoft Office |publisher=Microsoft |date=May 21, 2008 |accessdate=October 30, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090501133844/http://www.microsoft.com/Presspass/press/2008/may08/05-21ExpandedFormatsPR.mspx |archivedate=May 1, 2009 |df= }}</ref>\n* '''[[Microsoft Excel]]:''' a [[spreadsheet]] editor that originally competed with the dominant [[Lotus 1-2-3]] and eventually outsold it.

Ecma International has published the Office Open XML specification free of copyrights and Microsoft has granted patent rights to the formats technology under the Open Specification Promise<ref>[https://www.microsoft.com/interop/osp/default.mspx Microsoft Open Specification Promise]</ref> and has made available free downloadable converters for previous versions of Microsoft Office including Office 2003, Office XP, Office 2000 and Office 2004 for the [[Macintosh|Mac]]. Third-party implementations of Office Open XML exist on the Mac platform (iWork 08) and [[Linux]] ([[OpenOffice.org]] 2.3 \u2013 Novell Edition only).\n\n=== Unicode and bi-directional texts ===\nAnother point of criticism Microsoft Office has faced was the lack of support in its Mac versions for [[Unicode]] and [[Bi-directional text]] languages, notably [[Arabic alphabet|Arabic]] and [[Hebrew alphabet|Hebrew]]. This issue, which had existed since the first release in 1989, was addressed in the 2016 version.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.msdn.com/macmojo/archive/2007/09/25/velkommen-tervetuloa-velkommen-and-bienvenue-paris.aspx|title=\"Velkommen, Tervetuloa, Velkommen\" and \"Bienvenue \u00e0 Paris\"|last=Paquin|first=Eric|publisher=[[Microsoft]]|work=Mac Mojo}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Type-in-a-bi-directional-language-in-Office-2016-for-Mac-d7bb1d52-4d82-4482-910f-d74b7c3bd468|title=Type in a bi-directional language in Office 2016 for Mac|publisher=[[Microsoft]]|work=Office Support|accessdate=September 10, 2016}}</ref>\n\n=== Privacy ===\nOn 13 November 2018, a report initiated by the Government of the Netherlands concluded that Microsoft Office 2016 and Office 365 do not comply with [[General Data Protection Regulation|GDPR]], the European law which regulates data protection and privacy for all citizens in and outside the EU and EFTA region.<ref>https://www.privacycompany.eu/en/impact-assessment-shows-privacy-risks-microsoft-office-proplus-enterprise/</ref> The investigation was initiated by the observation that Microsoft does not reveal or share publicly any data collected about users of its software. In addition, the company does not provide users of its (Office) software an option to turn off diagnostic and telemetry data sent back to the company. Researchers found that most of the data that the Microsoft software collects and \"sends home\" is diagnostics. Researchers also observed that Microsoft \"seemingly tried to make the system GDPR compliant by storing Office documents on servers based in the EU\". However, they discovered the software packages collected additional data that contained private user information, some of which was stored on servers located in the US.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rijksoverheid.nl/binaries/rijksoverheid/documenten/rapporten/2018/11/07/data-protection-impact-assessment-op-microsoft-office/Update+on+negotiations+between+Dutch+central+government+and+Microsoft+on+GDPR+compliance+November+7.pdf|last=Netherlands Ministry of Justice|title=Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) Microsoft Office 2016 and 365}}</ref> The Netherlands Ministry of Justice hired Privacy Company to probe and evaluate the use of Microsoft Office products in the public sector.<ref name=\"The Register\"/> \"Microsoft systematically collects data on a large scale about the individual use of Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and Outlook.

The standard version consisted of Word 7.0, Excel 7.0, PowerPoint 7.0, and Schedule+ 7.0. The professional edition contained all of the items in the standard version plus [[Microsoft Access]] 7.0. If the professional version was purchased in [[CD-ROM]] form, it also included [[Microsoft Bookshelf|Bookshelf]].{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}\n\nThe logo used in Office 95 returns in Office 97, 2000 and XP.

Office 97 also featured Natural Language Systems and grammar checking. Office 97 was the first version of Office to include the Office Assistant. In Brazil, it was also the first version to introduce the Registration Wizard, a precursor to [[Microsoft Product Activation]].\n\n====Microsoft Office 2000 to 2003====\n'''[[Microsoft Office 2000]]''' (Office 9.0) introduced [[adaptive]] menus, where little-used options were hidden from the user.

Office 2000 automatically trusts [[macro (computer science)|macros]] (written in VBA 6) that were digitally signed from authors who have been previously designated as trusted. The Registration Wizard, a precursor to [[Microsoft Product Activation]], remained in Brazil and was also extended to Australia and New Zealand, though not for volume-licensed editions. Academic software in the United States and Canada also featured the Registration Wizard.\n\n'''[[Microsoft Office XP]]''' (Office 10.0 or Office 2002) was released in conjunction with [[Windows XP]], and was a major upgrade with numerous enhancements and changes over Office 2000. Office XP introduced the [[Safe Mode]] feature, which allows applications such as Outlook to boot when it might otherwise fail by bypassing a corrupted [[Windows registry|registry]] or a faulty add-in. [[Smart tag (Microsoft)|Smart tag]] is a technology introduced with Office XP in Word and Excel and discontinued in Office 2010. Office XP includes integrated voice command and text dictation capabilities, as well as [[handwriting recognition]].

It was first announced by [[Bill Gates]] on August 1, 1988, at [[COMDEX]] in Las Vegas. Initially a marketing term for an [[office suite]] (bundled set of productivity [[application software|applications]]), the first version of Office contained [[Microsoft Word]], [[Microsoft Excel]], and [[Microsoft PowerPoint]]. Over the years, Office applications have grown substantially closer with shared features such as a common spell checker, [[Object Linking and Embedding|OLE]] data integration and [[Visual Basic for Applications]] scripting language. Microsoft also positions Office as a development platform for line-of-business software under the [[Office Business Applications]] brand. On July 10, 2012, [[Softpedia]] reported that Office was being used by over a billion people worldwide.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://news.softpedia.com/news/Microsoft-s-Office-Has-Over-One-Billion-Users-280426.shtml |title=Microsoft\u2019s Office Has over One Billion Users |work=[[Softpedia]] |publisher=SoftNews |date=July 10, 2012}}</ref>\n\nOffice is produced in several versions targeted towards different end-users and computing environments. The original, and most widely used version, is the [[desktop computer|desktop]] version, available for [[personal computer|PCs]] running the [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] and [[macOS]] [[operating system]]s. [[Office on the web]] is a version of the software that runs within a [[web browser]], while Microsoft also maintains [[Microsoft Office mobile apps|Office mobile apps]] for [[Android (operating system)|Android]] and [[iOS]].\n\nSince [[Office 2013]], Microsoft has promoted [[Office 365]] as the primary means of obtaining Microsoft Office: it allows the use of the software and other services on a [[subscription business model]], and users receive free feature updates to the software for the lifetime of the subscription, including new features and [[cloud computing]] integration that are not necessarily included in the \"on-premises\" releases of Office sold under conventional license terms. In 2017, revenue from Office 365 overtook conventional license sales.\n\nThe current on-premises, desktop version of Office is [[Microsoft Office 2019|Office 2019]], released on September 24, 2018.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-starts-rolling-out-office-2019-for-windows-and-mac/|title=Microsoft starts rolling out Office 2019 for Windows and Mac|last=Foley|first=Mary Jo|website=ZDNet|language=en|access-date=2019-02-06}}</ref>\n\n{{TOC limit}}\n\n==Components==\n{{See also|List of Microsoft Office programs}}\n\n===Desktop applications===\nUnless stated otherwise, desktop applications are available for Windows and macOS.\n* '''[[Microsoft Word]]:''' a [[word processor]] included in Microsoft Office and some editions of the now-discontinued [[Microsoft Works]]. The first version of Word, released in the autumn of 1983, was for the MS-DOS operating system and introduced the [[computer mouse]] to more users. Word 1.0 could be purchased with a bundled mouse, though none was required. Following the precedents of [[LisaWrite]] and [[MacWrite]], Word for Macintosh attempted to add closer [[WYSIWYG]] features into its package. Word for Mac was released in 1985. Word for Mac was the first graphical version of Microsoft Word. Initially, it implemented the proprietary [[Doc (computing)|.doc]] format as its primary format. Word 2007, however, deprecated this format in favor of [[Office Open XML]], which was later standardized by [[Ecma International]] as an [[open format]]. Support for [[Portable Document Format]] (PDF) and [[OpenDocument]] (ODF) was first introduced in Word for Windows with [[Service Pack]] 2 for Word 2007.<ref>{{cite press release|url=https://www.microsoft.com/Presspass/press/2008/may08/05-21ExpandedFormatsPR.mspx |title=Microsoft Expands List of Formats Supported in Microsoft Office |publisher=Microsoft |date=May 21, 2008 |accessdate=October 30, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090501133844/http://www.microsoft.com/Presspass/press/2008/may08/05-21ExpandedFormatsPR.mspx |archivedate=May 1, 2009 |df= }}</ref>\n* '''[[Microsoft Excel]]:''' a [[spreadsheet]] editor that originally competed with the dominant [[Lotus 1-2-3]] and eventually outsold it.

On the Mac OS, Microsoft offered several versions of Outlook in the late 1990s, but only for use with [[Microsoft Exchange Server]].

In addition, the company does not provide users of its (Office) software an option to turn off diagnostic and telemetry data sent back to the company. Researchers found that most of the data that the Microsoft software collects and \"sends home\" is diagnostics. Researchers also observed that Microsoft \"seemingly tried to make the system GDPR compliant by storing Office documents on servers based in the EU\".

The standard version consisted of Word 7.0, Excel 7.0, PowerPoint 7.0, and Schedule+ 7.0. The professional edition contained all of the items in the standard version plus [[Microsoft Access]] 7.0. If the professional version was purchased in [[CD-ROM]] form, it also included [[Microsoft Bookshelf|Bookshelf]].{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}\n\nThe logo used in Office 95 returns in Office 97, 2000 and XP.

Office 97 also featured Natural Language Systems and grammar checking. Office 97 was the first version of Office to include the Office Assistant. In Brazil, it was also the first version to introduce the Registration Wizard, a precursor to [[Microsoft Product Activation]].\n\n====Microsoft Office 2000 to 2003====\n'''[[Microsoft Office 2000]]''' (Office 9.0) introduced [[adaptive]] menus, where little-used options were hidden from the user.

The Registration Wizard, a precursor to [[Microsoft Product Activation]], remained in Brazil and was also extended to Australia and New Zealand, though not for volume-licensed editions. Academic software in the United States and Canada also featured the Registration Wizard.\n\n'''[[Microsoft Office XP]]''' (Office 10.0 or Office 2002) was released in conjunction with [[Windows XP]], and was a major upgrade with numerous enhancements and changes over Office 2000. Office XP introduced the [[Safe Mode]] feature, which allows applications such as Outlook to boot when it might otherwise fail by bypassing a corrupted [[Windows registry|registry]] or a faulty add-in. [[Smart tag (Microsoft)|Smart tag]] is a technology introduced with Office XP in Word and Excel and discontinued in Office 2010. Office XP includes integrated voice command and text dictation capabilities, as well as [[handwriting recognition]].

In an article by [[Women's Wear Daily|Women\u2019s Wear Daily]], the founder of Fashion Revolution responded to the criticisms by explaining how the index was not meant to be a way to audit the companies but rather a way to assess the accessibility of the information regarding the supply chain processes of their product to the customers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://wwd.com/fashion-news/fashion-scoops/fashion-revolution-criticism-transparency-index-chanel-fendi-sustainability-10421031/|title=Fashion Revolution Responds to Criticism From Brands on Its Transparency Index|last=Theodosi|first=Natalie|last2=Theodosi|first2=Natalie|date=2016-04-29|website=WWD|language=en|access-date=2020-04-15}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://fashionrevolution.org/ Fashion Revolution website]\n\n{{Fashion}}\n\n[[Category:Fashion organizations]]\n[[Category:Clothing controversies]]\n[[Category:Workers' rights organizations]]\n[[Category:Business ethics organizations]]\n[[Category:Social responsibility organizations]]\n[[Category:Non-profit organisations based in England]]\n", "text_old": "{{advert|date=May 2019}}\n[[File:Who Made My Clothes Protest.jpg|thumb|Protestors hold \"Who Made My Clothes\" signs]]\n'''Fashion Revolution''' is a not-for-profit global movement with teams in over 100 countries around the world.

The index assesses the level of transparency and support for workers\u2019 rights of various fashion brands by looking at the information released by the company and by distributing various questionnaires. In an article by [[Women's Wear Daily|Women\u2019s Wear Daily]], the founder of Fashion Revolution responded to the criticisms by explaining how the index was not meant to be a way to audit the companies but rather a way to assess the accessibility of the information regarding the supply chain processes of their product to the customers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://wwd.com/fashion-news/fashion-scoops/fashion-revolution-criticism-transparency-index-chanel-fendi-sustainability-10421031/|title=Fashion Revolution Responds to Criticism From Brands on Its Transparency Index|last=Theodosi|first=Natalie|last2=Theodosi|first2=Natalie|date=2016-04-29|website=WWD|language=en|access-date=2020-04-15}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://fashionrevolution.org/ Fashion Revolution website]\n\n{{Fashion}}\n\n[[Category:Fashion organizations]]\n[[Category:Clothing controversies]]\n[[Category:Workers' rights organizations]]\n[[Category:Business ethics organizations]]\n[[Category:Social responsibility organizations]]\n[[Category:Non-profit organisations based in England]]\n", "name_user": "ArtsPatron1", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fashion_Revolution"}

Lion contacted Marc Shaiman, who expressed interest in the project only if his partner Scott Wittman could participate, and Lion agreed. The two enlisted the help of actress and singer [[Annie Golden]] to produce a demo recording containing three songs, one of which, \"Good Morning Baltimore,\" eventually became the show's opening number.  Based on their initial work, Lion felt confident that she had hired the right team.<ref>Pogrebin, Robin.

''The New York Times'', October 16, 2002\n</ref>\n\nLion contacted [[Rob Marshall]] about directing the musical.  At the time he was involved in negotiations to direct the screen adaptation of ''[[Chicago (2002 film)|Chicago]]'', but he agreed to become involved in the early development stages of ''Hairspray'' with the stipulation he would drop out if assigned the film.  Marshall remembered [[Marissa Jaret Winokur]] from her brief appearance in the film ''[[American Beauty (1999 film)|American Beauty]]'' and arranged a meeting with Shaiman and Wittman.  The two immediately felt she was right for the role of Tracy Turnblad but hesitated to commit without seeing any other auditions.  They hired Winokur to work with them on the project with the understanding she might be replaced later.  One year later, Winokur was diagnosed with cervical cancer. Certain she would lose the role if the creative team learned about her condition, she underwent a [[hysterectomy]] without telling anyone but her immediate family.  The treatment and surgery succeeded, and Winokur returned to the project.<ref>[http://www.thehpvtest.com/cervical-cancer-survivor-stories-marissa-jaret-winokur.html?terms=Winokur undated interview] thehpvtest.com\n {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080619074930/http://www.thehpvtest.com/cervical-cancer-survivor-stories-marissa-jaret-winokur.html?terms=Winokur |date=June 19, 2008 }}</ref>  Meanwhile, Marshall had started work on ''Chicago'', and Lion hired [[Jack O'Brien (director)|Jack O'Brien]] and [[Jerry Mitchell]] to direct and to choreograph, respectively.

''The Advocate'',  July 23, 2002</ref>\n\nAccording to Shaiman, one song, \"I Know Where I've Been,\" became controversial during the genesis of the score:\n\n<blockquote>This was ... inspired by a scene late in the [1988] movie that takes place on the black side of town.  It never dawned on us that a torrent of protest would follow us from almost everyone involved with the show. 'It's too sad. ... It's too preachy. ... It doesn't belong. ... Tracy should sing the [[eleven o'clock number]].' We simply didn't want our show to be yet another show-biz version of a civil rights story where the black characters are just background.  And what could be more Tracy Turnblad-like than to give the 'eleven o'clock number' to the black family at the heart of the struggle?  Luckily ... the audiences embraced this moment, which enriches the happy ending to follow, and it is our proudest achievement of the entire experience of writing ''Hairspray''.\"<ref>''The Roots'', p. 142</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Productions==\n===Original Broadway production===\nAfter a successful tryout at [[Seattle, Washington|Seattle]]'s [[5th Avenue Theatre]], ''Hairspray'' opened on Broadway at the [[Neil Simon Theatre]] on August 15, 2002.<ref name=\"Playbill 2002-05-21\">{{cite web|url= http://www.playbill.com/news/article/69730.html|title= ''Playbill'' News: A New 'Do: Capacity of Neil Simon Theatre Will Increase for ''Hairspray''|last= Jones|first= Kenneth|date= May 21, 2002|publisher= Playbill.com|accessdate= February 11, 2009|url-status= dead|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070927191328/http://www.playbill.com/news/article/69730.html|archivedate= September 27, 2007}}</ref> [[Jack O'Brien (director)|Jack O'Brien]] directed the production, which [[Jerry Mitchell]] choreographed, with set design by [[David Rockwell]], costume design by [[William Ivey Long]], lighting design by [[Kenneth Posner]], sound design by Steve C.

Tracy Turnblad, an overweight high school student, wakes up (\"[[Good Morning Baltimore]]\") and goes to school, where she receives a warning for \"inappropriate hair height\". After school, Tracy rushes home with her best friend, Penny, to catch the local teenage dance show, ''The Corny Collins Show'' (\"The Nicest Kids in Town\"). Edna, Tracy's shy and overweight mother, is ironing and complains about the noise of the music coming from the television, while Penny's mother, Prudy, complains about it being race music. After an announcement that auditions for a place on the show will be held due to the fact that Brenda (one of the Corny Collins Council Members) has taken a leave of absence from the show for \"9 months\", Tracy begs her mother for permission to audition. Edna, fearing that Tracy will be laughed at due to her weight, refuses. Penny and Amber (the main dancer on ''The Corny Collins Show'') have similar arguments with their mothers (\"Mama, I'm a Big Girl Now\").\n\nAfter gaining permission and support from her father, Wilbur, Tracy auditions for the show and bumps into a teenage heartthrob, Link Larkin, which leads into a dream sequence (\"[[I Can Hear the Bells]]\"). Velma Von Tussle, the racist producer of The Corny Collins Show, rejects Tracy from the audition because of her size (\"[[(The Legend of) Miss Baltimore Crabs]]\"), as well as refusing a black girl, Little Inez.\nBack at school, Tracy is sent to detention for her \"monumental hair-don't\". There she meets black dancer Seaweed J. Stubbs (the son of the hostess of \"Negro Day\" on The Corny Collins Show, Motormouth Maybelle), who teaches her several dance moves. She uses the new dance steps at the Sophomore Hop the following day to introduce herself to Corny Collins (\"[[Madison (dance)|The Madison]]\"). When Corny sees how well Tracy can dance, he gives her a place on the show (\"The Nicest Kids in Town\" (Reprise)). During the broadcast, Link, following Corny's suggestion, sings \"It Takes Two\" to Tracy, much to Amber's dismay. After the show, Mr Spritzer, the show's worrisome sponsor, appeals to Velma over Tracy's appointment to the Council. Velma, threatening to fire Corny from the show, is eventually left distraught and determines to ruin Tracy (\"Velma's Revenge\").\n\nAt the Turnblad house, Edna is receiving calls from fans who saw Tracy on the show. A call comes in from Mr Pinky, the owner of a plus-size dress shop, for an endorsement. Tracy pleads with her mother to come with her and to act as her agent although Edna has not left their apartment in years. Finally making it outside, Edna is given a huge makeover (\"[[Welcome to the '60s]]\") and Tracy becomes the spokes-girl for the shop. At school, signs of Tracy's fame are evident in the schoolyard, with graffiti on the walls and Shelly, another Council Member sporting Tracy's signature hairdo. During a game of dodge ball, a jealous Amber knocks Tracy out, and Link rushes to her side. Penny and Seaweed, who have developed a liking for each other, rush to fetch the school nurse, only to find her out sick. Seaweed, suggesting that some fun would make Tracy feel better, invites all of them to his mother's record shop for a platter party (\"[[Run and Tell That]]\").\nAt the shop, Tracy rallies everyone to march against the station on the following day's Mother-Daughter Day, as blacks are not allowed on the show except for the monthly Negro Day. Before they start, Motormouth Maybelle convinces the initially reluctant Edna and Wilbur to march as well. Link declined to participate for the sake of his contract with the show. During the protest, led by Motormouth, Velma calls the police and fights break out. When the police arrive on the scene, almost everyone is arrested (\"[[Big, Blonde and Beautiful]]\").\n\n===Act II===\nAfter the march, most of the women are locked up in a women's penitentiary (\"The Big Dollhouse\"). Because of Velma's dirty tactics, the governor pardons and releases her and Amber. Wilbur bails out the remaining people, excluding Tracy who is forced to remain in jail through another one of Velma's manipulations.  Tracy is alone and wishes that Link could be with her (\"Good Morning Baltimore\" (Reprise)). Back at the Har-De-Har Hut (Wilbur's joke shop), Wilbur and Edna are left destitute because of the money it cost them to bail everyone out and with Tracy still in prison. Edna sympathizes with her daughter's dream \u2013 she had dreamt of making her \"own line of queen-sized dress patterns\". Edna and Wilbur reminisce about their past and how they can never be parted from each other (\"(You're) Timeless to Me\").\nDuring the night, Link sneaks into the jail where he finds Tracy in solitary confinement. As Link and Tracy reunite, Penny's mother, Prudy, punishes Penny for \"going to jail without her permission\" and ties her up in her bedroom where Seaweed comes to her rescue.  Both couples declare their love for one another (\"[[Without Love (Hairspray song)|Without Love]]\"). After escaping from their respective prisons, the couples seek refuge at Motormouth Maybelle's Record Shop. Tracy thinks that it is unfair that after all of their hard work, ''The Corny Collins Show'' is still segregated. They devise a plan to help integrate the show, and Motormouth remembers their long fight for equality (\"[[I Know Where I've Been]]\").\n\nOn the day of the Miss Teenage Hairspray competition, Corny Collins starts the show with a song (\"(It's) Hairspray\"). Amber shows off her talents in a bid to get more votes from the viewers (\"Cooties\"). Just as the results are about to be announced, Tracy stuns Amber as she makes her entrance in a magenta dress without any petticoat underneath, taking over the stage, and is joined by Link, Penny, Seaweed, Edna, Wilbur, Little Inez, Corny, and Motormouth. Tracy is declared the winner of the competition. Amber and Velma protest the results, claiming that it is all wrong. Little Inez then tries to take the crown by force when Amber refuses to hand it over, but Tracy stops her, claiming that her heart is set on something more important, which is Link and her future. She then proclaims the Corny Collins show is \"now and forevermore\" racially integrated, to much applause. When all is announced, Mr. Spritzer runs onstage thrilled with the public's response to the telecast and announces that the governor has pardoned Tracy and gave her a full college scholarship and he offers Link a recording contract and Velma the position of vice president of Ultra Glow \u2013 beauty products for women of colour, much to the latter's chagrin. Prudy arrives at the station and, seeing how happy Penny is with Seaweed, accepts her daughter for who she is. At the height of the moment, the company invites Amber and Velma to join the celebration. With the station in joyous celebration, Tracy and Link cement their love with a kiss (\"[[You Can't Stop the Beat]]\").\n\n==Characters==\nPrincipal roles and casts of major productions of stage productions of ''Hairspray'':\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" Class=\"wikitable\" style=\"line-height:1.2\"\n|-\n!

In Seattle, an infomercial about safety on the road titled \"Blood on the Pavement\" followed \"The Nicest Kids in Town\", and is included on the cast album following \"You Can't Stop the Beat\". Early versions of the show featured \"Velma's Cha-Cha\" and \"The Status Quo\" (Seattle) (with its short reprise \"Rage\") during Tracy's audition and dismissal, but the team instead opted for \"(The Legend of) Miss Baltimore Crabs\", as the audience did not like seeing Tracy being verbally attacked after \"I Can Hear the Bells\".<ref>''The Roots'', p. 59</ref> After Tracy's rejection from the Council, there was a scene in the Har-De-Har Hut in which Wilbur tried to cheer Tracy up,<ref>''The Roots'', p. 62</ref> singing that \"It Doesn't Get Better than This\". Later replaced by the similar \"Positivity\", the scene was cut early in the Seattle tryout as it was deemed emotionally redundant.\n\nAfter Tracy eventually made it on the show, there was a song \"The New Girl in Town\", which was sung first by the Councilettes and later by the black girls. Although cut during the Seattle tryout, it was included in the [[Hairspray (2007 film)|2007 film]] and appears in the show's instrumental score.<ref>[http://www.zipcon.net/~beckyd/writing3.php?i=5th-hairspray-synopsis Review of ''Hairspray'' during its pre-Broadway run] zipcon.net</ref> \"The Mother-Daughter Cha-Cha-Cha\" was another cut number that originally followed \"Big, Blonde, and Beautiful\".  Later, the writers absorbed the protest rally and Mother-Daughter Day into the number, thus deleting the song and folding the sequence into a single scene.<ref>''The Roots'', p. 109</ref> A song called \"Step on Up\" was also cut in favor of \"I Know Where I've Been\".<ref>''The Roots'', pp. 142-43</ref> Early on in the genesis of the show, the plot involved a \"Miss Auto Show\" competition, as in the 1988 film, instead of \"Miss Teenage Hairspray\". For this competition, later revised due to the cost of cars onstage, there was a song called \"Take a Spin\" sung by Corny in the place of \"(It's) Hairspray\".<ref>''The Roots'', p. 149</ref> After Amber's rendition of \"Cooties\", Tracy had a song before the finale called \"It Ain't Over 'Til the Fat Lady Sings,\" though it was cut after readings of the show; it was included as a track on the Special Edition of the 2007 motion picture's soundtrack.<ref>\"Dear Listener\", Note included in the Special Edition of the 2007 Hairspray Movie Soundtrack</ref>\n\n==Instrumentation==\nHairspray's orchestration calls for fifteen musicians, consisting of the following: three keyboards, the first of which is played by the conductor, bass guitar, two guitars, drums, percussion, trumpet, trombone, two woodwind players, two violins, and cello.  The guitarists both double on acoustic and electric guitars, and the trumpet doubles on flugelhorn; the original production also featured a piccolo trumpet double during tryouts.  The first woodwind player doubles on tenor and alto saxophones, flute and clarinet.  The second woodwind player doubles on tenor, alto and baritone saxophones, flute and clarinet.\n\nIn the original Broadway production, a few of the actors mimed on musical instruments in order to fulfil a minimum musician requirement at the Neil Simon Theatre. <ref> [https://www.local802afm.org/allegro/articles/the-history-of-broadway-theatre-minimums/] Local 802 history of broadway theatre orchestra minimums </ref>\n\nTouring productions often use smaller/reduced orchestrations to save on costs - the UK 2017/18 tour which used an 8 piece orchestration - 2 Keyboards (Of which the first is played by the conductor), Electric Guitar, Bass Guitar, Drum Kit, one woodwind player (playing Alto, Tenor and Baritone Saxophones and Clarinet), Trombone and Trumpet. <ref> 2017/8 touring score </ref>\n\n==Themes==\n''Hairspray'' explores the themes of racial prejudice and freedom of expression. It highlights individuality, and the importance of everyone working together for something to become revolutionary. The musical is empowering, as although it touches on racial issues that were prevalent in 1960s America, it focuses more on the attitudes that are associated with it, and the power that we have to change discrimination.<ref>Delmont, M. (2016). Hairspray\u2019s Revealing Portrayal of Racism in America. The Atlantic.</ref> The musical encourages individuality, acceptance and freedom. It is a musical that can be applied to any social context and time, as it highlights ongoing issues such as fat-shaming, racism and discrimination.<ref>Simmons, M. (2014). Hairspray: Going Beyond the Script. Theatre World.</ref> It also explores femininity in terms of the female characters. Notably, Tracy\u2019s mother, Edna Turnblad, is performed in drag during the shows. Allowing a drag role for Edna adds a queerness to the musical as it does not include any gay characters.<ref name=\"Dvoskin, Michelle 2016\">Dvoskin, Michelle. \"Embracing excess: The queer feminist power of musical theatre diva roles.\" ''Studies In Musical Theatre'' vol. 10, no. 1 (2016): 93-103.</ref> Edna is considered to be the non-racialised other that is part of the story in Hairspray.<ref>Schrader, Valerie Lynn. \"Good Morning Baltimore\": Whiteness, Blackness, and Othering in the 2007 Movie Musical.\" ''Ohio Communication Journal'' vol. 49, (2011): 127-143.</ref> The musical also challenges the societal norms of a female. The body size of Edna also adds emphasis to the diva roles that are present in the show.<ref name=\"Dvoskin, Michelle 2016\"/> Thus, the musical highlights female characters that are strong and associated with diva characteristics.\n\n''Hairspray'' the musical emphasises on issues of acceptance and discrimination within society.<ref>'Social and Historical Context of Hairspray' History of Music Theory (blog), accessed: 20th May 2018, https://mtstapes.wordpress.com/social-and-historical-context-of-hairspray/</ref> Being set in the 1960s, the musical highlights the struggles of racial discrimination of African-Americans during the civil rights movement, with a focus on the world of popular culture. The Civil Rights Movement (1954-1986) was a positive time in America's history; it allowed African-Americans the right to vote, gave them a voice, and introduced freedom for all.<ref> 'Social and Historical Context of Hairspray', History of Music Theory (blog), accessed 23rd May 2019, https://mtstapes.wordpress.com/social-and-historical-context-of-hairspray</ref> However, African-Americans still experienced vast inequality during this time. This reality, of the whites holding all institutional and political power, is portrayed in ''Hairspray'' in the Corny Collins Show. The African-Americans are only allowed to dance on the show once a month, and there is a stereotypical racial representation of dance style. The social representation in ''Hairspray'' is parallel to the reality of the 1960s. By the end of the show, the African-Americans are allowed to dance on the show with indicates racial integration. <ref>Curry, R.R. 'Hairspray: The revolutionary way to restructure and hold your history', Literary Film Quarterly, 1996</ref>. The show is empowering by acknowledging the challenges and limitations enforced on African Americans during this time, and also reminds audiences of the progress made as a result of the civil rights movement. Its message can also be used to empower change for other forms of discrimination that are still relevant in today\u2019s society.<ref>Delmont, Matthew.

Lion contacted Marc Shaiman, who expressed interest in the project only if his partner Scott Wittman could participate, and Lion agreed. The two enlisted the help of actress and singer [[Annie Golden]] to produce a demo recording containing three songs, one of which, \"Good Morning Baltimore,\" eventually became the show's opening number.  Based on their initial work, Lion felt confident that she had hired the right team.<ref>Pogrebin, Robin.

''The New York Times'', October 16, 2002\n</ref>\n\nLion contacted [[Rob Marshall]] about directing the musical.  At the time he was involved in negotiations to direct the screen adaptation of ''[[Chicago (2002 film)|Chicago]]'', but he agreed to become involved in the early development stages of ''Hairspray'' with the stipulation he would drop out if assigned the film.  Marshall remembered [[Marissa Jaret Winokur]] from her brief appearance in the film ''[[American Beauty (1999 film)|American Beauty]]'' and arranged a meeting with Shaiman and Wittman.  The two immediately felt she was right for the role of Tracy Turnblad but hesitated to commit without seeing any other auditions.  They hired Winokur to work with them on the project with the understanding she might be replaced later.  One year later, Winokur was diagnosed with cervical cancer. Certain she would lose the role if the creative team learned about her condition, she underwent a [[hysterectomy]] without telling anyone but her immediate family.  The treatment and surgery succeeded, and Winokur returned to the project.<ref>[http://www.thehpvtest.com/cervical-cancer-survivor-stories-marissa-jaret-winokur.html?terms=Winokur undated interview] thehpvtest.com\n {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080619074930/http://www.thehpvtest.com/cervical-cancer-survivor-stories-marissa-jaret-winokur.html?terms=Winokur |date=June 19, 2008 }}</ref>  Meanwhile, Marshall had started work on ''Chicago'', and Lion hired [[Jack O'Brien (director)|Jack O'Brien]] and [[Jerry Mitchell]] to direct and to choreograph, respectively.

''The Advocate'',  July 23, 2002</ref>\n\nAccording to Shaiman, one song, \"I Know Where I've Been,\" became controversial during the genesis of the score:\n\n<blockquote>This was ... inspired by a scene late in the [1988] movie that takes place on the black side of town.  It never dawned on us that a torrent of protest would follow us from almost everyone involved with the show. 'It's too sad. ... It's too preachy. ... It doesn't belong. ... Tracy should sing the [[eleven o'clock number]].' We simply didn't want our show to be yet another show-biz version of a civil rights story where the black characters are just background.  And what could be more Tracy Turnblad-like than to give the 'eleven o'clock number' to the black family at the heart of the struggle?  Luckily ... the audiences embraced this moment, which enriches the happy ending to follow, and it is our proudest achievement of the entire experience of writing ''Hairspray''.\"<ref>''The Roots'', p. 142</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Productions==\n===Original Broadway production===\nAfter a successful tryout at [[Seattle, Washington|Seattle]]'s [[5th Avenue Theatre]], ''Hairspray'' opened on Broadway at the [[Neil Simon Theatre]] on August 15, 2002.<ref name=\"Playbill 2002-05-21\">{{cite web|url= http://www.playbill.com/news/article/69730.html|title= ''Playbill'' News: A New 'Do: Capacity of Neil Simon Theatre Will Increase for ''Hairspray''|last= Jones|first= Kenneth|date= May 21, 2002|publisher= Playbill.com|accessdate= February 11, 2009|url-status= dead|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070927191328/http://www.playbill.com/news/article/69730.html|archivedate= September 27, 2007}}</ref> [[Jack O'Brien (director)|Jack O'Brien]] directed the production, which [[Jerry Mitchell]] choreographed, with set design by [[David Rockwell]], costume design by [[William Ivey Long]], lighting design by [[Kenneth Posner]], sound design by Steve C.

Tracy Turnblad, an overweight high school student, wakes up (\"[[Good Morning Baltimore]]\") and goes to school, where she receives a warning for \"inappropriate hair height\". After school, Tracy rushes home with her best friend, Penny, to catch the local teenage dance show, ''The Corny Collins Show'' (\"The Nicest Kids in Town\"). Edna, Tracy's shy and overweight mother, is ironing and complains about the noise of the music coming from the television, while Penny's mother, Prudy, complains about it being race music. After an announcement that auditions for a place on the show will be held due to the fact that Brenda (one of the Corny Collins Council Members) has taken a leave of absence from the show for \"9 months\", Tracy begs her mother for permission to audition. Edna, fearing that Tracy will be laughed at due to her weight, refuses. Penny and Amber (the main dancer on ''The Corny Collins Show'') have similar arguments with their mothers (\"Mama, I'm a Big Girl Now\").\n\nAfter gaining permission and support from her father, Wilbur, Tracy auditions for the show and bumps into a teenage heartthrob, Link Larkin, which leads into a dream sequence (\"[[I Can Hear the Bells]]\"). Velma Von Tussle, the racist producer of The Corny Collins Show, rejects Tracy from the audition because of her size (\"[[(The Legend of) Miss Baltimore Crabs]]\"), as well as refusing a black girl, Little Inez.\nBack at school, Tracy is sent to detention for her \"monumental hair-don't\". There she meets black dancer Seaweed J. Stubbs (the son of the hostess of \"Negro Day\" on The Corny Collins Show, Motormouth Maybelle), who teaches her several dance moves. She uses the new dance steps at the Sophomore Hop the following day to introduce herself to Corny Collins (\"[[Madison (dance)|The Madison]]\"). When Corny sees how well Tracy can dance, he gives her a place on the show (\"The Nicest Kids in Town\" (Reprise)). During the broadcast, Link, following Corny's suggestion, sings \"It Takes Two\" to Tracy, much to Amber's dismay. After the show, Mr Spritzer, the show's worrisome sponsor, appeals to Velma over Tracy's appointment to the Council. Velma, threatening to fire Corny from the show, is eventually left distraught and determines to ruin Tracy (\"Velma's Revenge\").\n\nAt the Turnblad house, Edna is receiving calls from fans who saw Tracy on the show. A call comes in from Mr Pinky, the owner of a plus-size dress shop, for an endorsement. Tracy pleads with her mother to come with her and to act as her agent although Edna has not left their apartment in years. Finally making it outside, Edna is given a huge makeover (\"[[Welcome to the '60s]]\") and Tracy becomes the spokes-girl for the shop. At school, signs of Tracy's fame are evident in the schoolyard, with graffiti on the walls and Shelly, another Council Member sporting Tracy's signature hairdo. During a game of dodge ball, a jealous Amber knocks Tracy out, and Link rushes to her side. Penny and Seaweed, who have developed a liking for each other, rush to fetch the school nurse, only to find her out sick. Seaweed, suggesting that some fun would make Tracy feel better, invites all of them to his mother's record shop for a platter party (\"[[Run and Tell That]]\").\nAt the shop, Tracy rallies everyone to march against the station on the following day's Mother-Daughter Day, as blacks are not allowed on the show except for the monthly Negro Day. Before they start, Motormouth Maybelle convinces the initially reluctant Edna and Wilbur to march as well. Link declined to participate for the sake of his contract with the show. During the protest, led by Motormouth, Velma calls the police and fights break out. When the police arrive on the scene, almost everyone is arrested (\"[[Big, Blonde and Beautiful]]\").\n\n===Act II===\nAfter the march, most of the women are locked up in a women's penitentiary (\"The Big Dollhouse\"). Because of Velma's dirty tactics, the governor pardons and releases her and Amber. Wilbur bails out the remaining people, excluding Tracy who is forced to remain in jail through another one of Velma's manipulations.  Tracy is alone and wishes that Link could be with her (\"Good Morning Baltimore\" (Reprise)). Back at the Har-De-Har Hut (Wilbur's joke shop), Wilbur and Edna are left destitute because of the money it cost them to bail everyone out and with Tracy still in prison. Edna sympathizes with her daughter's dream \u2013 she had dreamt of making her \"own line of queen-sized dress patterns\". Edna and Wilbur reminisce about their past and how they can never be parted from each other (\"(You're) Timeless to Me\").\nDuring the night, Link sneaks into the jail where he finds Tracy in solitary confinement. As Link and Tracy reunite, Penny's mother, Prudy, punishes Penny for \"going to jail without her permission\" and ties her up in her bedroom where Seaweed comes to her rescue.  Both couples declare their love for one another (\"[[Without Love (Hairspray song)|Without Love]]\"). After escaping from their respective prisons, the couples seek refuge at Motormouth Maybelle's Record Shop. Tracy thinks that it is fair that after all of their hard work, ''The Corny Collins Show'' is still segregated. They devise a plan to help integrate the show, and Motormouth remembers their long fight for equality (\"[[I Know Where I've Been]]\").\n\nOn the day of the Miss Teenage Hairspray competition, Corny Collins starts the show with a song (\"(It's) Hairspray\"). Amber shows off her talents in a bid to get more votes from the viewers (\"Cooties\"). Just as the results are about to be announced, Tracy stuns Amber as she makes her entrance in a magenta dress without any petticoat underneath, taking over the stage, and is joined by Link, Penny, Seaweed, Edna, Wilbur, Little Inez, Corny, and Motormouth. Tracy is declared the winner of the competition. Amber and Velma protest the results, claiming that it is all wrong. Little Inez then tries to take the crown by force when Amber refuses to hand it over, but Tracy stops her, claiming that her heart is set on something more important, which is Link and her future. She then proclaims the Corny Collins show is \"now and forevermore\" racially integrated, to much applause. When all is announced, Mr. Spritzer runs onstage thrilled with the public's response to the telecast and announces that the governor has pardoned Tracy and gave her a full college scholarship and he offers Link a recording contract and Velma the position of vice president of Ultra Glow \u2013 beauty products for women of colour, much to the latter's chagrin. Prudy arrives at the station and, seeing how happy Penny is with Seaweed, accepts her daughter for who she is. At the height of the moment, the company invites Amber and Velma to join the celebration. With the station in joyous celebration, Tracy and Link cement their love with a kiss (\"[[You Can't Stop the Beat]]\").\n\n==Characters==\nPrincipal roles and casts of major productions of stage productions of ''Hairspray'':\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" Class=\"wikitable\" style=\"line-height:1.2\"\n|-\n!

In Seattle, an infomercial about safety on the road titled \"Blood on the Pavement\" followed \"The Nicest Kids in Town\", and is included on the cast album following \"You Can't Stop the Beat\". Early versions of the show featured \"Velma's Cha-Cha\" and \"The Status Quo\" (Seattle) (with its short reprise \"Rage\") during Tracy's audition and dismissal, but the team instead opted for \"(The Legend of) Miss Baltimore Crabs\", as the audience did not like seeing Tracy being verbally attacked after \"I Can Hear the Bells\".<ref>''The Roots'', p. 59</ref> After Tracy's rejection from the Council, there was a scene in the Har-De-Har Hut in which Wilbur tried to cheer Tracy up,<ref>''The Roots'', p. 62</ref> singing that \"It Doesn't Get Better than This\". Later replaced by the similar \"Positivity\", the scene was cut early in the Seattle tryout as it was deemed emotionally redundant.\n\nAfter Tracy eventually made it on the show, there was a song \"The New Girl in Town\", which was sung first by the Councilettes and later by the black girls. Although cut during the Seattle tryout, it was included in the [[Hairspray (2007 film)|2007 film]] and appears in the show's instrumental score.<ref>[http://www.zipcon.net/~beckyd/writing3.php?i=5th-hairspray-synopsis Review of ''Hairspray'' during its pre-Broadway run] zipcon.net</ref> \"The Mother-Daughter Cha-Cha-Cha\" was another cut number that originally followed \"Big, Blonde, and Beautiful\".  Later, the writers absorbed the protest rally and Mother-Daughter Day into the number, thus deleting the song and folding the sequence into a single scene.<ref>''The Roots'', p. 109</ref> A song called \"Step on Up\" was also cut in favor of \"I Know Where I've Been\".<ref>''The Roots'', pp. 142-43</ref> Early on in the genesis of the show, the plot involved a \"Miss Auto Show\" competition, as in the 1988 film, instead of \"Miss Teenage Hairspray\". For this competition, later revised due to the cost of cars onstage, there was a song called \"Take a Spin\" sung by Corny in the place of \"(It's) Hairspray\".<ref>''The Roots'', p. 149</ref> After Amber's rendition of \"Cooties\", Tracy had a song before the finale called \"It Ain't Over 'Til the Fat Lady Sings,\" though it was cut after readings of the show; it was included as a track on the Special Edition of the 2007 motion picture's soundtrack.<ref>\"Dear Listener\", Note included in the Special Edition of the 2007 Hairspray Movie Soundtrack</ref>\n\n==Instrumentation==\nHairspray's orchestration calls for fifteen musicians, consisting of the following: three keyboards, the first of which is played by the conductor, bass guitar, two guitars, drums, percussion, trumpet, trombone, two woodwind players, two violins, and cello.  The guitarists both double on acoustic and electric guitars, and the trumpet doubles on flugelhorn; the original production also featured a piccolo trumpet double during tryouts.  The first woodwind player doubles on tenor and alto saxophones, flute and clarinet.  The second woodwind player doubles on tenor, alto and baritone saxophones, flute and clarinet.\n\nIn the original Broadway production, a few of the actors mimed on musical instruments in order to fulfil a minimum musician requirement at the Neil Simon Theatre. <ref> [https://www.local802afm.org/allegro/articles/the-history-of-broadway-theatre-minimums/] Local 802 history of broadway theatre orchestra minimums </ref>\n\nTouring productions often use smaller/reduced orchestrations to save on costs - the UK 2017/18 tour which used an 8 piece orchestration - 2 Keyboards (Of which the first is played by the conductor), Electric Guitar, Bass Guitar, Drum Kit, one woodwind player (playing Alto, Tenor and Baritone Saxophones and Clarinet), Trombone and Trumpet. <ref> 2017/8 touring score </ref>\n\n==Themes==\n''Hairspray'' explores the themes of racial prejudice and freedom of expression. It highlights individuality, and the importance of everyone working together for something to become revolutionary. The musical is empowering, as although it touches on racial issues that were prevalent in 1960s America, it focuses more on the attitudes that are associated with it, and the power that we have to change discrimination.<ref>Delmont, M. (2016). Hairspray\u2019s Revealing Portrayal of Racism in America. The Atlantic.</ref> The musical encourages individuality, acceptance and freedom. It is a musical that can be applied to any social context and time, as it highlights ongoing issues such as fat-shaming, racism and discrimination.<ref>Simmons, M. (2014). Hairspray: Going Beyond the Script. Theatre World.</ref> It also explores femininity in terms of the female characters. Notably, Tracy\u2019s mother, Edna Turnblad, is performed in drag during the shows. Allowing a drag role for Edna adds a queerness to the musical as it does not include any gay characters.<ref name=\"Dvoskin, Michelle 2016\">Dvoskin, Michelle. \"Embracing excess: The queer feminist power of musical theatre diva roles.\" ''Studies In Musical Theatre'' vol. 10, no. 1 (2016): 93-103.</ref> Edna is considered to be the non-racialised other that is part of the story in Hairspray.<ref>Schrader, Valerie Lynn. \"Good Morning Baltimore\": Whiteness, Blackness, and Othering in the 2007 Movie Musical.\" ''Ohio Communication Journal'' vol. 49, (2011): 127-143.</ref> The musical also challenges the societal norms of a female. The body size of Edna also adds emphasis to the diva roles that are present in the show.<ref name=\"Dvoskin, Michelle 2016\"/> Thus, the musical highlights female characters that are strong and associated with diva characteristics.\n\n''Hairspray'' the musical emphasises on issues of acceptance and discrimination within society.<ref>'Social and Historical Context of Hairspray' History of Music Theory (blog), accessed: 20th May 2018, https://mtstapes.wordpress.com/social-and-historical-context-of-hairspray/</ref> Being set in the 1960s, the musical highlights the struggles of racial discrimination of African-Americans during the civil rights movement, with a focus on the world of popular culture. The Civil Rights Movement (1954-1986) was a positive time in America's history; it allowed African-Americans the right to vote, gave them a voice, and introduced freedom for all.<ref> 'Social and Historical Context of Hairspray', History of Music Theory (blog), accessed 23rd May 2019, https://mtstapes.wordpress.com/social-and-historical-context-of-hairspray</ref> However, African-Americans still experienced vast inequality during this time. This reality, of the whites holding all institutional and political power, is portrayed in ''Hairspray'' in the Corny Collins Show. The African-Americans are only allowed to dance on the show once a month, and there is a stereotypical racial representation of dance style. The social representation in ''Hairspray'' is parallel to the reality of the 1960s. By the end of the show, the African-Americans are allowed to dance on the show with indicates racial integration. <ref>Curry, R.R. 'Hairspray: The revolutionary way to restructure and hold your history', Literary Film Quarterly, 1996</ref>. The show is empowering by acknowledging the challenges and limitations enforced on African Americans during this time, and also reminds audiences of the progress made as a result of the civil rights movement. Its message can also be used to empower change for other forms of discrimination that are still relevant in today\u2019s society.<ref>Delmont, Matthew.
