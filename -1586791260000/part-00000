Both of them, together with Maria were arrested and shot on October 4, 1939, in the forest, north of Bydgoszcz ({{lang-pl|Las Gda\u0144ski}}).

First realizations include today's houses at 5/7/11 P\u0142ocka street.\n\n===1926-1936 Bydgoszcz development program<ref name=\"KB26\"/>===\nBogdan Raczkowski devised a grand urbanization project for the city, intending to support private construction initiatives and identifying specific areas to be developped. In addition to ''Sielanka'' and ''Skrzetusko'' districts, he focused his attention to streets Czarna Droga, Dwernickiego, [[Gimnazjalna, Libelta and Szwalbego streets in Bydgoszcz|Libelta]], Niemcewicza and Piotrowskiego. \n[[File:Bdg Szwederowo 1 06-2014.jpg|thumb|View of ''Szwederowo'' district]]\nHis idea was to assign districts purposes:\n* residential for  ''[[:pl:Bielawy (Bydgoszcz)|Bielawy]]'', ''[[:pl:Skrzetusko|Skrzetusko]]'', ''[[:pl:Szwederowo|Szwederowo]]'', ''[[:pl:Bielice (Bydgoszcz)|Bielice]]'', ''[[:pl:Wilczak (Bydgoszcz)|Wilczak]]'' and ''[[:pl:Okole (Bydgoszcz)|Okole]]'';\n* worker's dwellings for ''[[:pl:Miedzy\u0144|Miedzy\u0144]]'' and ''[[:pl:Jachcice|Jachcice]]''; \n* factories at ''[[:pl:Kapu\u015bciska|Kapu\u015bciska]]'', ''[[:pl:Zimne Wody (Bydgoszcz)|Zimne Wody]]'', ''[[:pl:\u0141\u0119gnowo|\u0141\u0119gnowo]]'', ''[[:pl:Siernieczek|Siernieczek]]''.\n\nThe last chapter of this extensive project was aiming at planning the urbanization of ''[[:pl:Osiedle Le\u015bne (Bydgoszcz)|Le\u015bny]]'' district, so as to become a showcase of Bydgoszcz for people entering the city from the north. With that ambition, in October 1933, the architect divided the {{convert|30|ha|m2}} area into 9 plots. This project was completed only on the eastern side of [[Gda\u0144ska Street in Bydgoszcz|Gda\u0144ska Street]], as the Ministry of Military Affairs did not allowed the development on the western part.\n\n==Works in [[Bromberg|Bydgoszcz]]==\nBogdan Raczkowski's education at the faculty of [[Lviv]] gave him the taste for new trends in architecture. At a time when [[Neoclassical architecture in Poland|neoclassicism]] was declining, technical and industrial progress opened up building potentials, with state-of-the-art materials ([[steel]] and [[glass]]) and innovative methods. In addition to the following realizations, Raczkowski also conceived habitations at Babia Wie\u015b (1926-1927), at 22-38 \u017bwirki i Wigury street (1930) and prepared in the early 1920s a project -never carried out- for the [[St. Vincent de Paul Basilica Minor in Bydgoszcz|basilica of St. Vincent de Paul in Bydgoszcz]].\n\n===Building at 13 Piotrowskiego, 1923-1925===\nThis tenement displays classical shapes on a 4-storey fa\u00e7ade, topped by [[rosette (design)|rosette]]s. \n<gallery mode=\"packed-hover\" heights=\"180\">\nFile:13 Piotrowskiego, Bydgoszcz.jpg|Tenement at 13, Piotrowskiego\n</gallery>\n\n===[[:pl:Ko\u015bci\u00f3\u0142 \u015bw.

After a dispute at the municipal council, Bogdan Raczkowski was dismissed these positions in April 1934: he then became an appraiser at the Bydgoszcz branch of [[Bank Gospodarstwa Krajowego]]. On her side, Maria was active in Bydgoszcz branch of the [[Polish Red Cross|Polish White Cross]], the social movement created in February 1918 by [[Helena Paderewska]], second wife of [[Ignacy Jan Paderewski]].<ref>The [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] did not allow the use of its name for Poland since as the country did not officially exist</ref>\n\nFleeing the Nazi invasion, the Raczkowski's left Bydgoszcz and moved to Marie's family estate in [[Kutno]] in September for one month.\nWhen they came back, their [[Kopernika Street in Bydgoszcz#House at 1 Asnyka street, corner with Kopernika street|house]] at 1, Asnyka street was occupied by a German officer: hence they moved to live at a cousin's flat, Stefan Je\u017cowski, on [[Adam Mickiewicz Alley in Bydgoszcz|Weyssenhoff Square]].\n[[Nazi Germany|Nazi authorities]] arranged for them to pick up few of their belonging from their former house on October 2, in the afternoon: when Bogdan and his daughter went to collect their belongings, they found the villa surrounded by the [[Gestapo]]. Both of them, together with Maria were arrested and shot on October 4, 1939, in the forest, north of Bydgoszcz ({{lang-pl|Las Gda\u0144ski}}). Only their son Zdzis\u0142aw escaped the round up, as he stayed with friends at that time. He quickly left Bydgoszcz and hid for the entire period of the war under the name of Zbigniew Ko\u017amian.<ref name=\"KB87\"/>\nTo make matter worse, Tadeusz, Bogdan's brother, was executed at the [[Valley of Death (Bydgoszcz)|Valley of Death]] in late October 1939.\n\nBogdan Raczkowski also painted pictures: landscapes of places he visited ([[Zakopane]], [[Ciechocinek]], [[Hel Peninsula|Hel]], [[Or\u0142owo, Inowroc\u0142aw County|Or\u0142owo]], [[Kharkiv]], Rostov, [[Sevastopol]], [[Capri]], [[Rome]]).

First realizations include today's houses at 5/7/11 P\u0142ocka street.\n\n===1926-1936 Bydgoszcz development program<ref name=\"KB26\"/>===\nBogdan Raczkowski devised a grand urbanization project for the city, intending to support private construction initiatives and identifying specific areas to be developped. In addition to ''Sielanka'' and ''Skrzetusko'' districts, he focused his attention to streets Czarna Droga, Dwernickiego, [[Gimnazjalna, Libelta and Szwalbego streets in Bydgoszcz|Libelta]], Niemcewicza and Piotrowskiego. \n[[File:Bdg Szwederowo 1 06-2014.jpg|thumb|View of ''Szwederowo'' district]]\nHis idea was to assign districts purposes:\n* residential for  ''[[:pl:Bielawy (Bydgoszcz)|Bielawy]]'', ''[[:pl:Skrzetusko|Skrzetusko]]'', ''[[:pl:Szwederowo|Szwederowo]]'', ''[[:pl:Bielice (Bydgoszcz)|Bielice]]'', ''[[:pl:Wilczak (Bydgoszcz)|Wilczak]]'' and ''[[:pl:Okole (Bydgoszcz)|Okole]]'';\n* worker's dwellings for ''[[:pl:Miedzy\u0144|Miedzy\u0144]]'' and ''[[:pl:Jachcice|Jachcice]]''; \n* factories at ''[[:pl:Kapu\u015bciska|Kapu\u015bciska]]'', ''[[:pl:Zimne Wody (Bydgoszcz)|Zimne Wody]]'', ''[[:pl:\u0141\u0119gnowo|\u0141\u0119gnowo]]'', ''[[:pl:Siernieczek|Siernieczek]]''.\n\nThe last chapter of this extensive project was aiming at planning the urbanization of ''[[:pl:Osiedle Le\u015bne (Bydgoszcz)|Le\u015bny]]'' district, so as to become a showcase of Bydgoszcz for people entering the city from the north. With that ambition, in October 1933, the architect divided the {{convert|30|ha|m2}} area into 9 plots. This project was completed only on the eastern side of [[Gda\u0144ska Street in Bydgoszcz|Gda\u0144ska Street]], as the Ministry of Military Affairs did not allowed the development on the western part.\n\n==Works in [[Bromberg|Bydgoszcz]]==\nBogdan Raczkowski's education at the faculty of [[Lviv]] gave him the taste for new trends in architecture. At a time when [[Neoclassical architecture in Poland|neoclassicism]] was declining, technical and industrial progress opened up building potentials, with state-of-the-art materials ([[steel]] and [[glass]]) and innovative methods. In addition to the following realizations, Raczkowski also conceived habitations at Babia Wie\u015b (1926-1927), at 22-38 \u017bwirki i Wigury street (1930) and prepared in the early 1920s a project -never carried out- for the [[St. Vincent de Paul Basilica Minor in Bydgoszcz|basilica of St. Vincent de Paul in Bydgoszcz]].\n\n===Building at 13 Piotrowskiego, 1923-1925===\nThis tenement displays classical shapes on a 4-storey fa\u00e7ade, topped by [[rosette (design)|rosette]]s. \n<gallery mode=\"packed-hover\" heights=\"180\">\nFile:13 Piotrowskiego, Bydgoszcz.jpg|Tenement at 13, Piotrowskiego\n</gallery>\n\n===[[:pl:Ko\u015bci\u00f3\u0142 \u015bw.

Finally, on December 13, 1937, only the west wing and the central part were officially opened.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://jurasza.umk.pl/historia-szpitala/#! |title=Historia Szpitala |last= |first= |date=2015 |website=jurasza.umk.pl |publisher=jurasza.pl |language=pl |access-date=25 March 2020}}</ref>  \nIt was the largest hospital built in the [[Second Polish Republic|interwar period]] in Poland, with 600 beds, gathering almost all departments under the same roof at a time when [[pavilion]]s structure organization was more popular in hospital construction.<ref name=\"KB26\"/>\n\nAfter Nazi invasion, the facility served as a military field hospital until August 1940.

By the time he entered the professional world of writers and TV production industry, Alberto was advised by his colleagues and mentors to change his name, a common dynamic in the industry, as such after consulting and researching names he decided to create a combination name based on his second name Albereto and a variation of his mother's surname Miagro in  [[Jud\u00e6o-Piedmontese]] language, and his pseudonym \"Alberto Migr\u00e9\" was born; giving him the seal to a successful career.\n\n==TV career==\nMigr\u00e9 started off working in radio stations, with the idea of eventually becoming an actor, although he himself acknowledged that his voice was not good for the [[microphone]].

When the cornerstone was laid in 1897, the oldest man in the county, Louis Peltier, was present; he remembered Fort Wayne when it was a fort. The courthouse was completed in 1903 at a total cost of $817,553. Built in the [[Beaux-Arts architecture]] style, it was one of the most expensive courthouses in the state. It also was filled with artwork that cost more than other entire courthouses of the time. The courthouse has been protected as a [[National Historic Landmark]] since 2003.

When the cornerstone was laid in 1897, the oldest man in the county, Louis Peltier, was present; he remembered Fort Wayne when it was a fort. The courthouse was completed in 1903 at a total cost of $817,553. Built in the [[Beaux-Arts architecture]] style, it was one of the most expensive courthouses in the state. It also was filled with artwork that cost more than other entire courthouses of the time. The courthouse has been protected as a [[National Historic Landmark]] since 2003.

On the day of the recording session for \"Secret Love\", Day had done vocal exercises at her home. Then about noon\u2014the session being scheduled for 1 p.m.\u2014she had set out on her bicycle to the studio. Heindorf had rehearsed the studio orchestra prior to Day's reaching the studio; upon her arrival, Heindorf suggested that Day do a practice run-through with the orchestra prior to recording any takes, but acquiesced to Day's request that her first performance with the orchestra be recorded. Day recalls, \"When I got there I sang the song with the orchestra for the first time&nbsp;... That was the first and only take we did.\" ... \"When I finished Ray called me into the sound booth grinning from ear to ear and said, 'That's it. You're never going to do it better.'\"<ref name=\"Sentimental Journey\"/>\n\nThe single of \"Secret Love\" was released on 9 October 1953\u2014three weeks prior to the premiere of the ''Calamity Jane'' film\u2014by her longtime record label, [[Columbia Records]] in both 45 and 78 rpm format (cat. no.40108).<ref>{{cite book\n| last = Whitburn\n| first = Joel\n| authorlink = Joel Whitburn\n| title = Top Pop Records 1940-1955\n| publisher = Record Research\n| year = 1973 }}\n</ref> The single entered the Top 20 bestselling singles survey at number 17 on ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' magazine dated 9 January 1954 with the single reaching number 1 on the Top 20 survey for the week ending 17 February 1954, the week in which the song's Academy Award nomination for Best Song had been announced, the nominations for the [[26th Academy Awards]] for the film year 1953 having been announced two days earlier. Day's \"Secret Love\", having spent three weeks ranked as the number 1 bestselling single by ''Billboard'', was still ranked as the number 4 bestseller the week of the 26th Academy Awards broadcast which occurred 25 March 1954. However, Day declined to perform the nominated (and ultimately victorious) \"Secret Love\" at the Academy Awards ceremony, later stating: \"When they asked me to sing 'Secret Love' on Academy Awards night I told them I couldn't\u2014not in front of those people\".<ref name=\"Sentimental Journey\"/> Instead, [[Ann Blyth]] performed the song at the ceremony. Day's refusal to perform \"Secret Love\" on the Academy Awards broadcast resulted in the [[Hollywood Women's Press Club]] \"honoring\" Day with the [[Golden Apple Award|Sour Apple Award]] as the most uncooperative celebrity of 1953: this put-down occasioned a bout of depression which kept Day virtually housebound for several weeks, and which Day eventually had to qualify her [[Christian Science]] outlook to deal with, consulting with a medical practitioner.<ref name=\"Sentimental Journey\"/>\n\n==1953/54 cover versions==\n{{Infobox song\n| name       = Secret Love\n| cover      =\n| alt        =\n| type       = single\n| artist     = [[Slim Whitman]]\n| album      = Favorites\n| B-side     = Why\n| released   = December 1953\n| format     = [[Single (music)|7\" single]]\n| recorded   = 4 December 1953\n| studio     =\n| venue      =\n| genre      = [[country music|C&W]]\n| length     = 2:25\n| label      = [[Imperial Records|Imperial]]\n| writer     = [[Sammy Fain]], [[Paul Francis Webster]]\n| producer   =\n| prev_title = Lord Help Me Be as Thou\n| prev_year  = 1953\n| next_title = [[Rose Marie (song)|Rose Marie]]\n| next_year  = 1954\n}}\n\nAt the time of the release of the Doris Day version of \"Secret Love\" two vocal [[cover versions]] were issued, one of which - by [[Gogi Grant]] with the Harry Geller orchestra - is said to have been recorded at [[RCA Victor]]'s LA recording studio in July 1953 which would make its recording earlier than Day's: the other vocal cover was recorded for [[MGM]] by [[Tommy Edwards]] with the [[LeRoy Holmes]] orchestra.

On the day of the recording session for \"Secret Love\", Day had done vocal exercises at her home. Then about noon\u2014the session being scheduled for 1 p.m.\u2014she had set out on her bicycle to the studio. Heindorf had rehearsed the studio orchestra prior to Day's reaching the studio; upon her arrival, Heindorf suggested that Day do a practice run-through with the orchestra prior to recording any takes, but acquiesced to Day's request that her first performance with the orchestra be recorded. Day recalls, \"When I got there I sang the song with the orchestra for the first time&nbsp;... That was the first and only take we did.\" ... \"When I finished Ray called me into the sound booth grinning from ear to ear and said, 'That's it. You're never going to do it better.'\"<ref name=\"Sentimental Journey\"/>\n\nThe single of \"Secret Love\" was released on 9 October 1953\u2014three weeks prior to the premiere of the ''Calamity Jane'' film\u2014by her longtime record label, [[Columbia Records]] in both 45 and 78 rpm format (cat. no.40108).<ref>{{cite book\n| last = Whitburn\n| first = Joel\n| authorlink = Joel Whitburn\n| title = Top Pop Records 1940-1955\n| publisher = Record Research\n| year = 1973 }}\n</ref> The single entered the Top 20 bestselling singles survey at number 17 on ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' magazine dated 9 January 1954 with the single reaching number 1 on the Top 20 survey for the week ending 17 February 1954, the week in which the song's Academy Award nomination for Best Song had been announced, the nominations for the [[26th Academy Awards]] for the film year 1953 having been announced two days earlier. Day's \"Secret Love\", having spent three weeks ranked as the number 1 bestselling single by ''Billboard'', was still ranked as the number 4 bestseller the week of the 26th Academy Awards broadcast which occurred 25 March 1954. However, Day declined to perform the nominated (and ultimately victorious) \"Secret Love\" at the Academy Awards ceremony, later stating: \"When they asked me to sing 'Secret Love' on Academy Awards night I told them I couldn't\u2014not in front of those people\".<ref name=\"Sentimental Journey\"/> Instead, [[Ann Blyth]] performed the song at the ceremony. Day's refusal to perform \"Secret Love\" on the Academy Awards broadcast resulted in the [[Hollywood Women's Press Club]] \"honoring\" Day with the [[Golden Apple Award|Sour Apple Award]] as the most uncooperative celebrity of 1953: this put-down occasioned a bout of depression which kept Day virtually housebound for several weeks, and which Day eventually had to qualify her [[Christian Science]] outlook to deal with, consulting with a medical practitioner.<ref name=\"Sentimental Journey\"/>\n\n==1953/54 cover versions==\n{{Infobox song\n| name       = Secret Love\n| cover      =\n| alt        =\n| type       = single\n| artist     = [[Slim Whitman]]\n| album      = Favorites\n| B-side     = Why\n| released   = December 1953\n| format     = [[Single (music)|7\" single]]\n| recorded   = 4 December 1953\n| studio     =\n| venue      =\n| genre      = [[country music|C&W]]\n| length     = 2:25\n| label      = [[Imperial Records|Imperial]]\n| writer     = [[Sammy Fain]], [[Paul Francis Webster]]\n| producer   =\n| prev_title = Lord Help Me Be as Thou\n| prev_year  = 1953\n| next_title = [[Rose Marie (song)|Rose Marie]]\n| next_year  = 1954\n}}\n\nAt the time of the release of the Doris Day version of \"Secret Love\" two vocal [[cover versions]] were issued, one of which - by [[Gogi Grant]] with the Harry Geller orchestra - is said to have been recorded at [[RCA Victor]]'s LA recording studio in July 1953 which would make its recording earlier than Day's: the other vocal cover was recorded for [[MGM]] by [[Tommy Edwards]] with the [[LeRoy Holmes]] orchestra.
